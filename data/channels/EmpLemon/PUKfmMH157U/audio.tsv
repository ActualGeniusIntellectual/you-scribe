0	6000	This is carbonated brown sugar water, and this is Coca-Cola.
6000	10000	To an impartial observer, these two products may seem identical,
10000	15000	but in the world of business, this little red can makes all the difference.
18000	22000	It's a name so gargantuan that even mentioning it feels redundant.
22000	27000	Their logo is about as recognizable as the sun, the moon, and the stars.
27000	34000	Across the history of human commerce, no other company even comes close to their longevity and scope.
34000	40000	Their product is available in so many markets that it's far easier to list the places that don't sell it.
40000	46000	The Koch empire has penetrated all corners of the earth, and even a little bit beyond that.
46000	53000	They are the envy of the business world, architects of the single most valuable brand that society has ever known.
53000	57000	When running a company, it's easy to believe that branding is everything.
57000	61000	Take away this red and white label, and what exactly do you have left?
61000	65000	It's tempting to consider whether you could sell someone anything
65000	69000	as long as it's behind those same familiar colors they know and love.
69000	76000	Forty years ago, Coca-Cola was thinking the very same thing, and nearly paid the ultimate price.
77000	85000	In my last video, I talked about Mac Tonight, the most successful ad campaign that McDonald's ever ran.
85000	91000	The character was a spiritual successor to Max Headroom, a memorable mascot for Coca-Cola
91000	94000	which showed up on television at around the same time.
94000	101000	Max Headroom was truly a bizarre character, but even more bizarre were the series of events which led to his adoption.
102000	108000	It's the 1980s, and Coca-Cola is quickly approaching its 100th year as a business.
108000	114000	The company brass aren't celebrating, however, as for the first time that nearly anyone can remember,
114000	119000	Coke is in danger of losing its title as America's favorite soft drink.
119000	127000	Bitter rival Pepsi-Cola has spent the past several decades slowly chipping away at Coke's dominant market share of the beverage industry.
127000	135000	By 1985, Pepsi was on the verge of the unthinkable, overtaking Coke as the leading cola brand.
135000	140000	The consumer market on which Coke had built their empire was rapidly changing.
140000	148000	The health risks of soda were starting to be scrutinized, and aging customers had begun switching to low calorie options like diet colas.
148000	155000	This demographic shift meant that future sales of Coke's flagship product would have to rely on the younger generation,
155000	158000	a generation who tended to prefer Pepsi.
158000	163000	By the 80s, Pepsi had already started out selling Coke in supermarkets,
163000	167000	with Coke hanging on to the overall lead through restaurants and vending machines.
167000	172000	If the market trends continued, that lead wouldn't last much longer.
172000	178000	However, as the old masters of the industry, Coke wasn't going down without a fight.
178000	183000	That fight would come from their new chairman, Roberto Goizueta.
184000	192000	Although he took over the company reigns at a very troublesome time, the Cuban-born magnate was no stranger to trouble.
192000	197000	In the 1950s, shortly after getting promoted to head of Coke's Havana bottling plant,
197000	203000	Goizueta defected to the United States in the wake of Fidel Castro's communist revolution.
203000	209000	Over the next 30 years, he methodically worked his way up the company ladder until 1980,
209000	214000	when he was finally promoted to the most influential seed in the beverage industry.
214000	221000	Mr. Goizueta had quite the origin story, but a necessary one for understanding his mentality towards change.
222000	227000	For decades, Coca-Cola had marketed their product on tradition and permanence.
227000	235000	They had built a mythical aura around their elusive secret formula, the very backbone of the company's monumental success.
235000	240000	The formula's lineage could be traced all the way back to its inventor John Pemberton,
240000	243000	who then sold it to company founder Asa Candler.
243000	248000	Within a decade, the Coke formula was selling in every American state,
248000	252000	becoming the eminent national beverage by the turn of the 20th century.
252000	258000	Not long afterward, company president Robert Woodruff would extend the taste of Coke to the rest of the world,
258000	262000	ushering in the most dominant period in company history.
262000	268000	By 1948, Coke controlled an estimated 60% market share of the beverage industry,
268000	272000	distributing their iconic product on a global scale.
272000	275000	Millions of customers across hundreds of countries,
275000	281000	all enjoying the same formula that had remained virtually unchanged for nearly a century.
281000	285000	It was Coca-Cola's golden goose, the real thing.
285000	288000	Altering it would be like rewriting the Bible.
288000	293000	And that's how the company thought, until Roberto Goizueta became chairman.
293000	300000	By 1984, the company's mighty 60% market share had shrunk to just over 20%.
300000	305000	Decades of complacency had allowed Coke's competition to get back in the race,
305000	308000	and Goizueta was poised to put a stop to it.
308000	314000	After becoming chairman, he boldly announced that there would be no more sacred cows than the company philosophy.
314000	322000	In the next few years, he followed through on that claim by introducing two landmark products, Diet Coke and Cherry Coke.
322000	327000	It was the first time the company had debuted any new product under the Coke name.
327000	330000	While both options proved to be quite popular,
330000	337000	they only sought to further compete with the company's flagship product, which was still losing ground to Pepsi.
337000	343000	Carrying the pride of one of America's most revered institutions, Coke was left with no choice.
343000	350000	In a time of Cold War tensions, Roberto Goizueta had to resort to the nuclear option.
350000	373000	A major factor behind Coke's declining market share was an ad campaign known as the Pepsi Challenge,
373000	380000	a blind taste test between the two colas that appeared to show an overall preference for the sweeter flavor of Pepsi.
380000	388000	While not exactly scientific, the campaign was undoubtedly successful at persuading many consumers to switch to the blue brand.
388000	393000	This led Coke to conclude that the only way to stop Pepsi was to beat them at their own game.
393000	399000	It was then when Coke's senior executives commissioned a secret assignment known as Project Kansas,
399000	404000	where company scientists were tasked with concocting a superior formula.
404000	407000	Soon enough, they had synthesized the ultimate flavor,
407000	412000	one that could consistently beat both Pepsi and the original Coke in a taste test.
412000	418000	With a potential new juggernaut on their hands, the company was now faced with a tough decision.
418000	425000	They could release the new drink as a standalone product and risk further diluting the already crowded Coke lineup.
425000	431000	Or they could do the unthinkable and replace the cornerstone of their entire brand.
431000	437000	Ultimately, the choice was up to Roberto Goizueta, who would look to his past for guidance.
437000	441000	Years earlier, when he was in charge of Caribbean distribution,
441000	446000	Goizueta had successfully boosted sales by slightly tweaking the Coke formula.
446000	451000	He had already once committed the cardinal sin, but perhaps he saw it as a virtue.
451000	454000	For Goizueta, the choice was clear.
454000	460000	Coca-Cola, the product that he had sold for his entire adult life, was on the way out.
460000	467000	And so, the Coca-Cola company was set to make the single ballsiest move in the entire history of their business,
467000	471000	replacing the very thing from which they were named.
471000	474000	As the story goes, shortly before the launch,
474000	479000	Roberto Goizueta sought out the blessing of his predecessor, Robert Woodruff.
479000	483000	The man who had built Coke into the behemoth that it was.
483000	487000	No one knows for sure what Woodruff really thought about the decision,
487000	489000	because he wouldn't live to see it happen.
489000	496000	In March 1985, Coca-Cola's most legendary executive passed away at the age of 95.
496000	500000	One month later, the company launched New Coke.
500000	504000	The events that followed were not nearly as sweet as they had hoped.
510000	513000	Coca-Cola is a pretty big company.
513000	517000	Buying one of their products really isn't going to matter one way or the other.
517000	521000	Where your purchase can matter is through a business like Bespoke Post.
521000	526000	They're a subscription box service that helps out small brands from all across America.

556000	561000	Luckily for me, Bespoke offers a variety of liquid refreshment options.

610000	615000	I'm sure that this fan favorite flavor isn't going away anytime soon.
616000	622000	Simply stated, my friends, we have a new formula for Coke.
622000	632000	Well, the real thing is in for a real change these days. Coca-Cola is altering its 99-year-old secret recipe.
632000	638000	On April 23, 1985, new Coke was rolled out nationwide.
638000	645000	Over the next two weeks, the remaining supply of the original formula would be phased out of supermarkets and restaurants.
645000	651000	The change was paired with an immediate new marketing campaign from company spokesman Bill Cosby.
651000	658000	Initial sales of the product appeared promising. Early data from select markets were in line with projections.
658000	665000	Roberto Goizueta confidently stood by his new product, already touting his decision as a success.
665000	673000	The celebration was a tad premature, however, as trouble was brewing beneath Coke's triumphant hubris.
673000	679000	Soon afterward, the company would find themselves struggling to stay afloat in a tidal wave of backlash.
679000	682000	One that spawned right in their own backyard.
685000	695000	Across its entire operational history, Coca-Cola has been headquartered in or near Atlanta, Georgia, the heart of the American South.
695000	703000	It's a part of the country which prides itself on a distinct regional identity, one that often runs contrary to the rest of the U.S.
703000	709000	For generations, many Southerners considered Coca-Cola as hallowed as barbecue in college football.
709000	719000	It is their bona fide beverage of choice, so much so that to this very day, many Southerners still use the word Coke to refer to all soft drinks.
719000	725000	For as long as they've been in business, Coca-Cola has relied on the South as a sales stronghold.
726000	731000	The fierce brand loyalty of the region may have led to complacency among Coke leadership,
731000	737000	who developed an expectation that Southern customers would welcome any change with open arms.
737000	742000	Following the release of new Coke, this assumption would be proven dead wrong.
742000	747000	Shortly after the switch, the prevailing sentiment in the South was one of abject betrayal.
747000	753000	For many, it represented yet another pillar of Southern tradition that had been surrendered to the Yankees.
753000	759000	Announcing the product smack dab in the middle of New York City certainly didn't help this perception.
759000	764000	With the change, Coke had effectively alienated their most die-hard supporters.
764000	768000	Emotions among the former faithful ranged from indignant to irate.
768000	774000	More than 40,000 letters of protest quickly piled up in Coca-Cola's office mailbox.
774000	779000	The Coke hotline was inundated with thousands of distraught callers per day.
779000	786000	A company hired psychiatrists who listened in to some of the messages to observe some customers acting as if they had lost a family member.
786000	791000	Needless to say, the reaction was much more severe than what was anticipated.
791000	797000	Questions immediately loomed as to why the company didn't bother to run more tests in their home market.
797000	802000	What little testing Coke did do in the South revealed a narrow preference for the new formula.
802000	807000	Company leadership saw this slight majority as justification for the change.
807000	813000	What they failed to consider, however, were the 10% of respondents who were vehemently against it.
813000	817000	In a controlled survey, people can't influence each other's opinions.
817000	820000	But in the real world, it's not that simple.
820000	826000	While most people were ambivalent about new Coke, those who disliked it really disliked it.
826000	833000	This vocal minority would end up tarnishing the new formula in the eyes of the entire general public.
833000	839000	Even if the average consumer didn't personally mind the switch, they likely knew someone who did.
839000	847000	This common circumstance led to frequent cases where drinking new Coke could potentially place someone in an awkward social situation.
847000	852000	For many, it was simply easier to avoid judgment and order something else.
852000	862000	The influence of peer pressure would start to significantly impact sales, as consumers were now hesitant to embrace a product which so many found undesirable.
862000	869000	All of a sudden, Coke was facing a major problem, one that extended far beyond the South.
869000	877000	People from all across the country were starting to get the impression that for the first time anyone could remember, a Coca-Cola product had missed the mark.
877000	883000	New Coke and the swelling controversy behind it had become a national fascination.
883000	890000	There's a saying in business that all publicity is good publicity, but for Coke's new formula, it was simply not the case.
890000	900000	Is Coke nervous? Not at all. We've never had more fun in our life. This wasn't a frivolous decision. It's something that we have worked on, John, over the last four years.
900000	908000	In the weeks after the debut, New Coke had become easy fodder for late-night comedians and bored journalists.
908000	916000	The media kept reporting on eccentric stories about just how far certain people had gone to express their displeasure towards the switch.
916000	929000	There was the story of Dan Lok, an avid Coke drinker from San Antonio, who was apparently so mortified by the New Coke announcement that he immediately went out and stockpiled 110 cases of the original formula.
929000	935000	Speaking of stockpiles, a few quick-thinking opportunists would use the hysteria to their advantage.
935000	942000	A Beverly Hills man named Dennis Overstreet bought 500 cases of the old formula for resale at his wine business.
943000	953000	After one month, he had customers lining up around the block trying to scoop up the last of his supply. Overstreet sold them the old cases for more than double what he paid for them.
953000	960000	The newfound scarcity of the old formula led many to scour some of the most rural areas for any remaining product.
960000	970000	When America's domestic supply was completely exhausted, a few loyalists resorted to smuggling in the old formula from foreign countries who had not yet made the switch.
970000	974000	Unfortunately, other forms of protest weren't so benign.
974000	982000	One story out of Marietta, Georgia featured a woman accosting a Coke delivery man with an umbrella while shouting about how they had ruined the flavor.
982000	995000	But by far the king of New Coke hostility was a Seattle man by the name of Gay Mullins, who would use $100,000 of his own money to found a new organization for enemies of the new formula.
995000	1001000	Under Mullins' leadership, the old Cola Drinkers of America would declare war against New Coke.
1001000	1012000	His battle tactics included selling anti-New Coke merchandise, spamming the hotline with complaints, and organizing mass protests which dumped gallons of New Coke into the local sewer.
1012000	1019000	At one point, Mullins even attempted to file a class action lawsuit against the soda giant, but it was quickly dismissed.
1019000	1028000	The constant hijinks would attract a ton of media attention to the movement, helping to grow Mullins' army to as much as 100,000 strong.
1033000	1039000	While acts of dissent were small in scope and petty in nature, their influence was tremendous.
1039000	1046000	Together, these minor demonstrations effectively counteracted millions of dollars of Coca-Cola marketing.
1046000	1053000	For as much as Coke tried to salvage the image of their new product, the American public was sticking to their own narrative.
1053000	1060000	It was only a matter of time before everyone saw New Coke as the most despised beverage in the nation.
1060000	1066000	To make matters even worse, New Coke had crossed the threshold where it was simply fun to hate.
1066000	1076000	During a baseball game at Houston's Astrodome, the crowd in attendance would infamously erupt in boos any time a New Coke ad flashed on the jumbotron.
1076000	1084000	By this point, the backlash had far exceeded just a few oddballs. It now resembled a full-fledged cultural event.
1084000	1092000	Part of the morbid curiosity that attracted people to the controversy was tied up in the novelty of seeing such a powerful company struggle.
1092000	1102000	Coca-Cola was supposed to be the shining example of American excellence. They almost never slipped up, so when they did, people made sure to let them know about it.
1102000	1113000	Lots of people who didn't even necessarily care about the product found entertainment value in rallying against a Goliath corporation who had fallen a bit too far out of touch.
1113000	1124000	For many, New Coke became an issue of patriotism, with one Alabama reporter even insinuating that the whole idea was a communist plot to destroy a champion of American ingenuity.
1124000	1133000	This theory wouldn't quite hold up after Fidel Castro, a longtime Coke drinker, published his own comments bashing the new formula.
1133000	1142000	Ironically, Castro had arguably set off this entire series of events in the first place by launching Roberto Goizueta on his journey to becoming the head of Coke.
1142000	1156000	After watching his bold decision catastrophically backfire, Goizueta's ultimate humiliation would come from the words of his father, who told him that the release of New Coke was the only time he ever agreed with Castro.
1158000	1170000	In the first month after release, Coke's management remained committed to their product and tried to weather the storm. But by the end of May, the situation was quickly becoming untenable.
1170000	1180000	First they said they were the real thing, then they said they were it. Then kabooey, they changed. So now I'm going to try my first Pepsi.
1180000	1186000	The company's strategy to poach business away from Pepsi was backfiring spectacularly.
1186000	1195000	Shortly after New Coke hit store shelves, Pepsi saw a 14% sales increase, the biggest in their entire history.
1195000	1205000	In mid-June, when soft drink sales typically rise, New Coke sales remained flat. Internally, Coca-Cola's officials were starting to panic.
1205000	1214000	Amid complaints over the flavor of their new product, the company would quietly alter the formula yet again, this time adjusting its acidity.
1214000	1223000	It was clear that Coke's leadership were losing faith in their vision. A few executives had already begun suggesting a return to the old formula.
1223000	1234000	The last hope for New Coke was the product catching on in foreign markets. But after seeing the fiasco taking place in the U.S., Coke's international distributors wanted no part of it.
1234000	1244000	Domestically, the company's own bottling partners were on the brink of revolt. New Coke was now threatening to dismantle the very structure of their business.
1244000	1250000	With no other options, the company swallowed their pride and submitted to the will of the people.
1251000	1257000	But one of us looked at the other and said, what are we doing? What are we doing here?
1257000	1262000	In the latest battle of the Cola Wars, Coke says it's bringing back its old formula.
1262000	1268000	Within the next several weeks, the original taste, which many people in the country apparently missed, will be available again.
1268000	1278000	Well, we read and we listened, and you know the rest. They're both yours, the new taste of Coke and Coca-Cola Classic. Your right of choice is back.
1278000	1288000	On July 11, 1985, Coca-Cola announced the return of the original formula, ending the New Coke experiment after just 79 days.
1288000	1298000	The new formula would continue to be sold as simply Coke, taking a back seat to the rightful flagship product, now called Coca-Cola Classic.
1298000	1307000	Following the controversy, longtime spokesman Bill Cosby would part ways with the company, claiming that promoting New Coke had hurt his credibility.
1307000	1315000	This left Coke with a vacancy in their marketing department, which would soon be filled by the aforementioned Max Headroom.
1315000	1322000	Despite the very entertaining ad campaign, New Coke's reputation could not be salvaged.
1322000	1330000	By the end of the 80s, its sales had dwindled to just a few percent of the market before the company decided to shelve it.
1330000	1338000	In 1992, they attempted to reintroduce the new formula as Coke II, which went about as well as you may have imagined.
1338000	1347000	After a few years, the product would be mostly discontinued once more, only sticking around in a few select markets around the country.
1347000	1358000	Roberto Goizueta, the mastermind behind it all, continued to swear by his creation. He personally drank the product until his death in 1997.
1358000	1365000	Although he oversaw one of the biggest blunders in company history, his tenure was still considered a success.
1365000	1378000	New Coke was expected to revive the Coca-Cola brand, and in a totally unorthodox way, it did just that, by making people realize just how much they enjoyed the original formula.
1378000	1388000	The return of Coke Classic led to nationwide euphoria. Sales figures not only rebounded, but went on to surpass what the brand had been doing prior to the switch.
1388000	1400000	In just six months, Coca-Cola was selling more than twice as fast as Pepsi, solidifying their place as the top soda company in the world, a position they continue to hold to this day.
1400000	1411000	Somehow, the biggest failure in industry history had directly contributed to its biggest success, a story so perfect that it led many to wonder whether it was planned all along.
1411000	1418000	The incident sparked a variety of other Coke-spiracies as to the company's true intentions with the new formula.
1418000	1428000	Some speculated that the change was a response to the Reagan administration's war on drugs, with Coke having to phase out the last remnants of the Coca plant from which they're named.
1429000	1440000	Whether or not this was the case remains dubious, but a far more likely explanation had to do with the company shifting from cane sugar to the far cheaper alternative of high fructose corn syrup.
1440000	1450000	Strangely enough, Coke Classic wasn't exactly the same as Classic Coke. The returning formula had entirely switched to using corn syrup as a sweetener.
1450000	1456000	Gay mullins who received the very first can of Coke Classic reported feeling sick after drinking it.
1456000	1465000	Many other astute consumers had their suspicions about the apparent bait-and-switch, but for the vast majority, it simply didn't matter.
1465000	1471000	They had complained and Coke had listened, which, at the end of the day, is all anyone really wanted.
1472000	1483000	In 2009, Coca-Cola officially dropped the word classic from their packaging, effectively erasing the last trace of New Coke's existence.
1483000	1489000	The company was surely eager to move on from such an embarrassing chapter of their history.
1489000	1494000	Since then, the debacle has mostly faded away into a distant memory.
1502000	1508000	A forbidden elixir which caused so much heartache that it was practically banished from public consumption.
1508000	1512000	An artifact so unwanted that it became unobtainable.
1512000	1521000	I've spent the past month trying to study it, and after examining just about every aspect of the stuff, I was still missing one crucial detail.
1521000	1527000	For as much research I've done, the literature, the footage, and the data don't tell the full story.
1528000	1535000	After dedicating so much effort trying to understand New Coke, the only thing left to do was taste it.
1535000	1537000	How do you even drink that?
1537000	1538000	Because it's delicious.
1538000	1539000	What?
1539000	1547000	In 2019, New Coke experienced a brief revival after being featured on the hit Netflix series Stranger Things.
1547000	1553000	As part of a promotional stunt, Coca-Cola would release a limited run of the 1985 formula.
1554000	1559000	Only 500,000 cans were distributed, with a few winding up for resale on eBay.
1559000	1567000	So I picked up a case, and for the first time in my life, tried the flavor that whipped an entire nation into a frenzy.
1567000	1572000	And to be perfectly honest, it was kind of hard to taste the difference.
1572000	1577000	It's probably because I don't drink soda often, or that I hadn't tasted a Coke in a while.
1577000	1580000	But I could barely tell the two drinks apart.
1580000	1587000	Funnily enough, even a guy like Gay Mullins, New Coke's most ardent critic, couldn't tell either.
1587000	1595000	After finally experiencing the world's most infamous beverage for myself, I couldn't help but speculate about a pretty absurd thought.
1595000	1599000	Does anyone actually know what Coca-Cola tastes like?
1599000	1605000	It seems like such a preposterous thing to suggest, but research tells us that most people don't.
1605000	1614000	Unlike what the marketing may tell you, independent taste tests have consistently shown that the average person can't tell the difference between Coke and Pepsi.
1614000	1618000	For most of us, taste is just not our strong suit.
1618000	1626000	Food marketing professor Joel Dubow found that incremental adjustments to soft drink flavor tend to go unnoticed by consumers,
1626000	1632000	meaning that New Coke could have theoretically succeeded had it been gradually consolidated with the old formula.
1633000	1640000	This is especially interesting, since many people today believe that New Coke failed because it was a bad product.
1640000	1644000	But in my personal assessment, that's simply not the case.
1644000	1651000	In fact, after going back and really comparing the two drinks, I actually preferred the flavor of the new formula.
1651000	1656000	It was good enough to where I wouldn't mind seeing it return as a permanent option.
1656000	1664000	The product itself was fine, and had it been executed a little differently, it could have been just as successful as any other Coke flavor.
1664000	1670000	The problem with New Coke had to do almost entirely with how it was presented to the public.
1670000	1677000	Coke may have envisioned the product as the ultimate answer to the Pepsi challenge, but they only ended up challenging themselves.
1677000	1685000	The very idea of replacing the most legendary consumer product in history was just too brazen for the public to accept.
1685000	1694000	New Coke was unknowingly pitted against 99 years of marketing genius, and in hindsight, it's unsurprising to see which side prevailed.
1694000	1700000	At the end of the day, all the research, focus groups, and taste tests were irrelevant.
1700000	1704000	New Coke never stood a chance for the simple reason that it wasn't the real thing.
1704000	1707000	It wasn't Coca-Cola.
1707000	1710000	But what is Coca-Cola, really?
1710000	1712000	Is it carbonated sugar water?
1712000	1715000	Is it 19th century headache tonic?
1715000	1720000	I've got a feeling that for most people, Coke isn't even supposed to taste good.
1720000	1724000	All it has to do is taste how they remember.
1724000	1729000	There's something to be said about a product that has lasted longer than virtually any other.
1729000	1733000	One that persists, unchanging, from generation to generation.
1733000	1741000	It's the comforting assurance that no matter how different the world becomes, there will be at least one thing that stays the same.
1741000	1744000	That is the essence of the real thing.
1744000	1752000	And no matter how good New Coke tasted, it was no match for just how much that old formula meant to so many people.
1752000	1756000	In consumer society, people don't have much.
1756000	1763000	Decades of marketing have all but replaced sincere human interaction with a superficial facade of products.
1763000	1767000	Take away those products, and you erase the soul of modern man.
1768000	1774000	When it was all said and done, Coca-Cola and the entire business world learned a valuable lesson.
1774000	1780000	If you have a formula that's worked for almost a century, it's probably best to stick with it.
1797000	1799000	More people prefer the new taste of Coke over Pepsi.
1799000	1800000	Let's take a look.
1800000	1801000	Good idea.
1801000	1803000	Pepsi drinkers, now's your chance. Become a Cokeologist.
1803000	1805000	That's the way!
