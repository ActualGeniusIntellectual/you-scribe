00:00.000 --> 00:06.000
This is carbonated brown sugar water, and this is Coca-Cola.

00:06.000 --> 00:10.000
To an impartial observer, these two products may seem identical,

00:10.000 --> 00:15.000
but in the world of business, this little red can makes all the difference.

00:18.000 --> 00:22.000
It's a name so gargantuan that even mentioning it feels redundant.

00:22.000 --> 00:27.000
Their logo is about as recognizable as the sun, the moon, and the stars.

00:27.000 --> 00:34.000
Across the history of human commerce, no other company even comes close to their longevity and scope.

00:34.000 --> 00:40.000
Their product is available in so many markets that it's far easier to list the places that don't sell it.

00:40.000 --> 00:46.000
The Koch empire has penetrated all corners of the earth, and even a little bit beyond that.

00:46.000 --> 00:53.000
They are the envy of the business world, architects of the single most valuable brand that society has ever known.

00:53.000 --> 00:57.000
When running a company, it's easy to believe that branding is everything.

00:57.000 --> 01:01.000
Take away this red and white label, and what exactly do you have left?

01:01.000 --> 01:05.000
It's tempting to consider whether you could sell someone anything

01:05.000 --> 01:09.000
as long as it's behind those same familiar colors they know and love.

01:09.000 --> 01:16.000
Forty years ago, Coca-Cola was thinking the very same thing, and nearly paid the ultimate price.

01:17.000 --> 01:25.000
In my last video, I talked about Mac Tonight, the most successful ad campaign that McDonald's ever ran.

01:25.000 --> 01:31.000
The character was a spiritual successor to Max Headroom, a memorable mascot for Coca-Cola

01:31.000 --> 01:34.000
which showed up on television at around the same time.

01:34.000 --> 01:41.000
Max Headroom was truly a bizarre character, but even more bizarre were the series of events which led to his adoption.

01:42.000 --> 01:48.000
It's the 1980s, and Coca-Cola is quickly approaching its 100th year as a business.

01:48.000 --> 01:54.000
The company brass aren't celebrating, however, as for the first time that nearly anyone can remember,

01:54.000 --> 01:59.000
Coke is in danger of losing its title as America's favorite soft drink.

01:59.000 --> 02:07.000
Bitter rival Pepsi-Cola has spent the past several decades slowly chipping away at Coke's dominant market share of the beverage industry.

02:07.000 --> 02:15.000
By 1985, Pepsi was on the verge of the unthinkable, overtaking Coke as the leading cola brand.

02:15.000 --> 02:20.000
The consumer market on which Coke had built their empire was rapidly changing.

02:20.000 --> 02:28.000
The health risks of soda were starting to be scrutinized, and aging customers had begun switching to low calorie options like diet colas.

02:28.000 --> 02:35.000
This demographic shift meant that future sales of Coke's flagship product would have to rely on the younger generation,

02:35.000 --> 02:38.000
a generation who tended to prefer Pepsi.

02:38.000 --> 02:43.000
By the 80s, Pepsi had already started out selling Coke in supermarkets,

02:43.000 --> 02:47.000
with Coke hanging on to the overall lead through restaurants and vending machines.

02:47.000 --> 02:52.000
If the market trends continued, that lead wouldn't last much longer.

02:52.000 --> 02:58.000
However, as the old masters of the industry, Coke wasn't going down without a fight.

02:58.000 --> 03:03.000
That fight would come from their new chairman, Roberto Goizueta.

03:04.000 --> 03:12.000
Although he took over the company reigns at a very troublesome time, the Cuban-born magnate was no stranger to trouble.

03:12.000 --> 03:17.000
In the 1950s, shortly after getting promoted to head of Coke's Havana bottling plant,

03:17.000 --> 03:23.000
Goizueta defected to the United States in the wake of Fidel Castro's communist revolution.

03:23.000 --> 03:29.000
Over the next 30 years, he methodically worked his way up the company ladder until 1980,

03:29.000 --> 03:34.000
when he was finally promoted to the most influential seed in the beverage industry.

03:34.000 --> 03:41.000
Mr. Goizueta had quite the origin story, but a necessary one for understanding his mentality towards change.

03:42.000 --> 03:47.000
For decades, Coca-Cola had marketed their product on tradition and permanence.

03:47.000 --> 03:55.000
They had built a mythical aura around their elusive secret formula, the very backbone of the company's monumental success.

03:55.000 --> 04:00.000
The formula's lineage could be traced all the way back to its inventor John Pemberton,

04:00.000 --> 04:03.000
who then sold it to company founder Asa Candler.

04:03.000 --> 04:08.000
Within a decade, the Coke formula was selling in every American state,

04:08.000 --> 04:12.000
becoming the eminent national beverage by the turn of the 20th century.

04:12.000 --> 04:18.000
Not long afterward, company president Robert Woodruff would extend the taste of Coke to the rest of the world,

04:18.000 --> 04:22.000
ushering in the most dominant period in company history.

04:22.000 --> 04:28.000
By 1948, Coke controlled an estimated 60% market share of the beverage industry,

04:28.000 --> 04:32.000
distributing their iconic product on a global scale.

04:32.000 --> 04:35.000
Millions of customers across hundreds of countries,

04:35.000 --> 04:41.000
all enjoying the same formula that had remained virtually unchanged for nearly a century.

04:41.000 --> 04:45.000
It was Coca-Cola's golden goose, the real thing.

04:45.000 --> 04:48.000
Altering it would be like rewriting the Bible.

04:48.000 --> 04:53.000
And that's how the company thought, until Roberto Goizueta became chairman.

04:53.000 --> 05:00.000
By 1984, the company's mighty 60% market share had shrunk to just over 20%.

05:00.000 --> 05:05.000
Decades of complacency had allowed Coke's competition to get back in the race,

05:05.000 --> 05:08.000
and Goizueta was poised to put a stop to it.

05:08.000 --> 05:14.000
After becoming chairman, he boldly announced that there would be no more sacred cows than the company philosophy.

05:14.000 --> 05:22.000
In the next few years, he followed through on that claim by introducing two landmark products, Diet Coke and Cherry Coke.

05:22.000 --> 05:27.000
It was the first time the company had debuted any new product under the Coke name.

05:27.000 --> 05:30.000
While both options proved to be quite popular,

05:30.000 --> 05:37.000
they only sought to further compete with the company's flagship product, which was still losing ground to Pepsi.

05:37.000 --> 05:43.000
Carrying the pride of one of America's most revered institutions, Coke was left with no choice.

05:43.000 --> 05:50.000
In a time of Cold War tensions, Roberto Goizueta had to resort to the nuclear option.

05:50.000 --> 06:13.000
A major factor behind Coke's declining market share was an ad campaign known as the Pepsi Challenge,

06:13.000 --> 06:20.000
a blind taste test between the two colas that appeared to show an overall preference for the sweeter flavor of Pepsi.

06:20.000 --> 06:28.000
While not exactly scientific, the campaign was undoubtedly successful at persuading many consumers to switch to the blue brand.

06:28.000 --> 06:33.000
This led Coke to conclude that the only way to stop Pepsi was to beat them at their own game.

06:33.000 --> 06:39.000
It was then when Coke's senior executives commissioned a secret assignment known as Project Kansas,

06:39.000 --> 06:44.000
where company scientists were tasked with concocting a superior formula.

06:44.000 --> 06:47.000
Soon enough, they had synthesized the ultimate flavor,

06:47.000 --> 06:52.000
one that could consistently beat both Pepsi and the original Coke in a taste test.

06:52.000 --> 06:58.000
With a potential new juggernaut on their hands, the company was now faced with a tough decision.

06:58.000 --> 07:05.000
They could release the new drink as a standalone product and risk further diluting the already crowded Coke lineup.

07:05.000 --> 07:11.000
Or they could do the unthinkable and replace the cornerstone of their entire brand.

07:11.000 --> 07:17.000
Ultimately, the choice was up to Roberto Goizueta, who would look to his past for guidance.

07:17.000 --> 07:21.000
Years earlier, when he was in charge of Caribbean distribution,

07:21.000 --> 07:26.000
Goizueta had successfully boosted sales by slightly tweaking the Coke formula.

07:26.000 --> 07:31.000
He had already once committed the cardinal sin, but perhaps he saw it as a virtue.

07:31.000 --> 07:34.000
For Goizueta, the choice was clear.

07:34.000 --> 07:40.000
Coca-Cola, the product that he had sold for his entire adult life, was on the way out.

07:40.000 --> 07:47.000
And so, the Coca-Cola company was set to make the single ballsiest move in the entire history of their business,

07:47.000 --> 07:51.000
replacing the very thing from which they were named.

07:51.000 --> 07:54.000
As the story goes, shortly before the launch,

07:54.000 --> 07:59.000
Roberto Goizueta sought out the blessing of his predecessor, Robert Woodruff.

07:59.000 --> 08:03.000
The man who had built Coke into the behemoth that it was.

08:03.000 --> 08:07.000
No one knows for sure what Woodruff really thought about the decision,

08:07.000 --> 08:09.000
because he wouldn't live to see it happen.

08:09.000 --> 08:16.000
In March 1985, Coca-Cola's most legendary executive passed away at the age of 95.

08:16.000 --> 08:20.000
One month later, the company launched New Coke.

08:20.000 --> 08:24.000
The events that followed were not nearly as sweet as they had hoped.

08:30.000 --> 08:33.000
Coca-Cola is a pretty big company.

08:33.000 --> 08:37.000
Buying one of their products really isn't going to matter one way or the other.

08:37.000 --> 08:41.000
Where your purchase can matter is through a business like Bespoke Post.

08:41.000 --> 08:46.000
They're a subscription box service that helps out small brands from all across America.

08:46.000 --> 08:52.000
Each month, they offer a variety of premium goods ranging from outdoor, homeware, clothing, and more.

08:52.000 --> 08:58.000
Just fill out the online quiz and discover which of these exciting new products may be right for you.

08:58.000 --> 09:04.000
Previously, they've helped me accomplish my dream of climbing the tallest mountain in Florida.

09:04.000 --> 09:11.000
Thanks to the spacious comfort of the weekender travel bag, I was able to conquer the entire 15 feet of elevation.

09:11.000 --> 09:16.000
Now, they've agreed to sponsor my new dream of dominating the beverage industry.

09:16.000 --> 09:21.000
Luckily for me, Bespoke offers a variety of liquid refreshment options.

09:21.000 --> 09:27.000
And unlike other subscription services, you don't have to worry about your order falling flat.

09:27.000 --> 09:30.000
Bespoke makes sure you get the real thing.

09:30.000 --> 09:32.000
Each month, you can preview your box.

09:32.000 --> 09:38.000
And if you don't like what you see, you can either swap it with something else or skip the month entirely for no charge.

09:38.000 --> 09:45.000
For my brewing purposes, I use the cast box to help me reach the bottom of the barrel in nutritional value.

09:45.000 --> 09:50.000
Now, it's just a matter of adding my proprietary secret ingredients and voila!

09:50.000 --> 09:53.000
It's my sugary, addictive drink of the future.

09:53.000 --> 09:56.000
I think I'll call it Emp Energy.

09:56.000 --> 10:04.000
So visit bespokepost.com slash emplemon and use code emplemon at checkout for 20% off your first box.

10:04.000 --> 10:07.000
And get started on creating your own secret formula.

10:07.000 --> 10:10.000
Oh, and no need to worry about Emp Energy.

10:10.000 --> 10:15.000
I'm sure that this fan favorite flavor isn't going away anytime soon.

10:16.000 --> 10:22.000
Simply stated, my friends, we have a new formula for Coke.

10:22.000 --> 10:32.000
Well, the real thing is in for a real change these days. Coca-Cola is altering its 99-year-old secret recipe.

10:32.000 --> 10:38.000
On April 23, 1985, new Coke was rolled out nationwide.

10:38.000 --> 10:45.000
Over the next two weeks, the remaining supply of the original formula would be phased out of supermarkets and restaurants.

10:45.000 --> 10:51.000
The change was paired with an immediate new marketing campaign from company spokesman Bill Cosby.

10:51.000 --> 10:58.000
Initial sales of the product appeared promising. Early data from select markets were in line with projections.

10:58.000 --> 11:05.000
Roberto Goizueta confidently stood by his new product, already touting his decision as a success.

11:05.000 --> 11:13.000
The celebration was a tad premature, however, as trouble was brewing beneath Coke's triumphant hubris.

11:13.000 --> 11:19.000
Soon afterward, the company would find themselves struggling to stay afloat in a tidal wave of backlash.

11:19.000 --> 11:22.000
One that spawned right in their own backyard.

11:25.000 --> 11:35.000
Across its entire operational history, Coca-Cola has been headquartered in or near Atlanta, Georgia, the heart of the American South.

11:35.000 --> 11:43.000
It's a part of the country which prides itself on a distinct regional identity, one that often runs contrary to the rest of the U.S.

11:43.000 --> 11:49.000
For generations, many Southerners considered Coca-Cola as hallowed as barbecue in college football.

11:49.000 --> 11:59.000
It is their bona fide beverage of choice, so much so that to this very day, many Southerners still use the word Coke to refer to all soft drinks.

11:59.000 --> 12:05.000
For as long as they've been in business, Coca-Cola has relied on the South as a sales stronghold.

12:06.000 --> 12:11.000
The fierce brand loyalty of the region may have led to complacency among Coke leadership,

12:11.000 --> 12:17.000
who developed an expectation that Southern customers would welcome any change with open arms.

12:17.000 --> 12:22.000
Following the release of new Coke, this assumption would be proven dead wrong.

12:22.000 --> 12:27.000
Shortly after the switch, the prevailing sentiment in the South was one of abject betrayal.

12:27.000 --> 12:33.000
For many, it represented yet another pillar of Southern tradition that had been surrendered to the Yankees.

12:33.000 --> 12:39.000
Announcing the product smack dab in the middle of New York City certainly didn't help this perception.

12:39.000 --> 12:44.000
With the change, Coke had effectively alienated their most die-hard supporters.

12:44.000 --> 12:48.000
Emotions among the former faithful ranged from indignant to irate.

12:48.000 --> 12:54.000
More than 40,000 letters of protest quickly piled up in Coca-Cola's office mailbox.

12:54.000 --> 12:59.000
The Coke hotline was inundated with thousands of distraught callers per day.

12:59.000 --> 13:06.000
A company hired psychiatrists who listened in to some of the messages to observe some customers acting as if they had lost a family member.

13:06.000 --> 13:11.000
Needless to say, the reaction was much more severe than what was anticipated.

13:11.000 --> 13:17.000
Questions immediately loomed as to why the company didn't bother to run more tests in their home market.

13:17.000 --> 13:22.000
What little testing Coke did do in the South revealed a narrow preference for the new formula.

13:22.000 --> 13:27.000
Company leadership saw this slight majority as justification for the change.

13:27.000 --> 13:33.000
What they failed to consider, however, were the 10% of respondents who were vehemently against it.

13:33.000 --> 13:37.000
In a controlled survey, people can't influence each other's opinions.

13:37.000 --> 13:40.000
But in the real world, it's not that simple.

13:40.000 --> 13:46.000
While most people were ambivalent about new Coke, those who disliked it really disliked it.

13:46.000 --> 13:53.000
This vocal minority would end up tarnishing the new formula in the eyes of the entire general public.

13:53.000 --> 13:59.000
Even if the average consumer didn't personally mind the switch, they likely knew someone who did.

13:59.000 --> 14:07.000
This common circumstance led to frequent cases where drinking new Coke could potentially place someone in an awkward social situation.

14:07.000 --> 14:12.000
For many, it was simply easier to avoid judgment and order something else.

14:12.000 --> 14:22.000
The influence of peer pressure would start to significantly impact sales, as consumers were now hesitant to embrace a product which so many found undesirable.

14:22.000 --> 14:29.000
All of a sudden, Coke was facing a major problem, one that extended far beyond the South.

14:29.000 --> 14:37.000
People from all across the country were starting to get the impression that for the first time anyone could remember, a Coca-Cola product had missed the mark.

14:37.000 --> 14:43.000
New Coke and the swelling controversy behind it had become a national fascination.

14:43.000 --> 14:50.000
There's a saying in business that all publicity is good publicity, but for Coke's new formula, it was simply not the case.

14:50.000 --> 15:00.000
Is Coke nervous? Not at all. We've never had more fun in our life. This wasn't a frivolous decision. It's something that we have worked on, John, over the last four years.

15:00.000 --> 15:08.000
In the weeks after the debut, New Coke had become easy fodder for late-night comedians and bored journalists.

15:08.000 --> 15:16.000
The media kept reporting on eccentric stories about just how far certain people had gone to express their displeasure towards the switch.

15:16.000 --> 15:29.000
There was the story of Dan Lok, an avid Coke drinker from San Antonio, who was apparently so mortified by the New Coke announcement that he immediately went out and stockpiled 110 cases of the original formula.

15:29.000 --> 15:35.000
Speaking of stockpiles, a few quick-thinking opportunists would use the hysteria to their advantage.

15:35.000 --> 15:42.000
A Beverly Hills man named Dennis Overstreet bought 500 cases of the old formula for resale at his wine business.

15:43.000 --> 15:53.000
After one month, he had customers lining up around the block trying to scoop up the last of his supply. Overstreet sold them the old cases for more than double what he paid for them.

15:53.000 --> 16:00.000
The newfound scarcity of the old formula led many to scour some of the most rural areas for any remaining product.

16:00.000 --> 16:10.000
When America's domestic supply was completely exhausted, a few loyalists resorted to smuggling in the old formula from foreign countries who had not yet made the switch.

16:10.000 --> 16:14.000
Unfortunately, other forms of protest weren't so benign.

16:14.000 --> 16:22.000
One story out of Marietta, Georgia featured a woman accosting a Coke delivery man with an umbrella while shouting about how they had ruined the flavor.

16:22.000 --> 16:35.000
But by far the king of New Coke hostility was a Seattle man by the name of Gay Mullins, who would use $100,000 of his own money to found a new organization for enemies of the new formula.

16:35.000 --> 16:41.000
Under Mullins' leadership, the old Cola Drinkers of America would declare war against New Coke.

16:41.000 --> 16:52.000
His battle tactics included selling anti-New Coke merchandise, spamming the hotline with complaints, and organizing mass protests which dumped gallons of New Coke into the local sewer.

16:52.000 --> 16:59.000
At one point, Mullins even attempted to file a class action lawsuit against the soda giant, but it was quickly dismissed.

16:59.000 --> 17:08.000
The constant hijinks would attract a ton of media attention to the movement, helping to grow Mullins' army to as much as 100,000 strong.

17:13.000 --> 17:19.000
While acts of dissent were small in scope and petty in nature, their influence was tremendous.

17:19.000 --> 17:26.000
Together, these minor demonstrations effectively counteracted millions of dollars of Coca-Cola marketing.

17:26.000 --> 17:33.000
For as much as Coke tried to salvage the image of their new product, the American public was sticking to their own narrative.

17:33.000 --> 17:40.000
It was only a matter of time before everyone saw New Coke as the most despised beverage in the nation.

17:40.000 --> 17:46.000
To make matters even worse, New Coke had crossed the threshold where it was simply fun to hate.

17:46.000 --> 17:56.000
During a baseball game at Houston's Astrodome, the crowd in attendance would infamously erupt in boos any time a New Coke ad flashed on the jumbotron.

17:56.000 --> 18:04.000
By this point, the backlash had far exceeded just a few oddballs. It now resembled a full-fledged cultural event.

18:04.000 --> 18:12.000
Part of the morbid curiosity that attracted people to the controversy was tied up in the novelty of seeing such a powerful company struggle.

18:12.000 --> 18:22.000
Coca-Cola was supposed to be the shining example of American excellence. They almost never slipped up, so when they did, people made sure to let them know about it.

18:22.000 --> 18:33.000
Lots of people who didn't even necessarily care about the product found entertainment value in rallying against a Goliath corporation who had fallen a bit too far out of touch.

18:33.000 --> 18:44.000
For many, New Coke became an issue of patriotism, with one Alabama reporter even insinuating that the whole idea was a communist plot to destroy a champion of American ingenuity.

18:44.000 --> 18:53.000
This theory wouldn't quite hold up after Fidel Castro, a longtime Coke drinker, published his own comments bashing the new formula.

18:53.000 --> 19:02.000
Ironically, Castro had arguably set off this entire series of events in the first place by launching Roberto Goizueta on his journey to becoming the head of Coke.

19:02.000 --> 19:16.000
After watching his bold decision catastrophically backfire, Goizueta's ultimate humiliation would come from the words of his father, who told him that the release of New Coke was the only time he ever agreed with Castro.

19:18.000 --> 19:30.000
In the first month after release, Coke's management remained committed to their product and tried to weather the storm. But by the end of May, the situation was quickly becoming untenable.

19:30.000 --> 19:40.000
First they said they were the real thing, then they said they were it. Then kabooey, they changed. So now I'm going to try my first Pepsi.

19:40.000 --> 19:46.000
The company's strategy to poach business away from Pepsi was backfiring spectacularly.

19:46.000 --> 19:55.000
Shortly after New Coke hit store shelves, Pepsi saw a 14% sales increase, the biggest in their entire history.

19:55.000 --> 20:05.000
In mid-June, when soft drink sales typically rise, New Coke sales remained flat. Internally, Coca-Cola's officials were starting to panic.

20:05.000 --> 20:14.000
Amid complaints over the flavor of their new product, the company would quietly alter the formula yet again, this time adjusting its acidity.

20:14.000 --> 20:23.000
It was clear that Coke's leadership were losing faith in their vision. A few executives had already begun suggesting a return to the old formula.

20:23.000 --> 20:34.000
The last hope for New Coke was the product catching on in foreign markets. But after seeing the fiasco taking place in the U.S., Coke's international distributors wanted no part of it.

20:34.000 --> 20:44.000
Domestically, the company's own bottling partners were on the brink of revolt. New Coke was now threatening to dismantle the very structure of their business.

20:44.000 --> 20:50.000
With no other options, the company swallowed their pride and submitted to the will of the people.

20:51.000 --> 20:57.000
But one of us looked at the other and said, what are we doing? What are we doing here?

20:57.000 --> 21:02.000
In the latest battle of the Cola Wars, Coke says it's bringing back its old formula.

21:02.000 --> 21:08.000
Within the next several weeks, the original taste, which many people in the country apparently missed, will be available again.

21:08.000 --> 21:18.000
Well, we read and we listened, and you know the rest. They're both yours, the new taste of Coke and Coca-Cola Classic. Your right of choice is back.

21:18.000 --> 21:28.000
On July 11, 1985, Coca-Cola announced the return of the original formula, ending the New Coke experiment after just 79 days.

21:28.000 --> 21:38.000
The new formula would continue to be sold as simply Coke, taking a back seat to the rightful flagship product, now called Coca-Cola Classic.

21:38.000 --> 21:47.000
Following the controversy, longtime spokesman Bill Cosby would part ways with the company, claiming that promoting New Coke had hurt his credibility.

21:47.000 --> 21:55.000
This left Coke with a vacancy in their marketing department, which would soon be filled by the aforementioned Max Headroom.

21:55.000 --> 22:02.000
Despite the very entertaining ad campaign, New Coke's reputation could not be salvaged.

22:02.000 --> 22:10.000
By the end of the 80s, its sales had dwindled to just a few percent of the market before the company decided to shelve it.

22:10.000 --> 22:18.000
In 1992, they attempted to reintroduce the new formula as Coke II, which went about as well as you may have imagined.

22:18.000 --> 22:27.000
After a few years, the product would be mostly discontinued once more, only sticking around in a few select markets around the country.

22:27.000 --> 22:38.000
Roberto Goizueta, the mastermind behind it all, continued to swear by his creation. He personally drank the product until his death in 1997.

22:38.000 --> 22:45.000
Although he oversaw one of the biggest blunders in company history, his tenure was still considered a success.

22:45.000 --> 22:58.000
New Coke was expected to revive the Coca-Cola brand, and in a totally unorthodox way, it did just that, by making people realize just how much they enjoyed the original formula.

22:58.000 --> 23:08.000
The return of Coke Classic led to nationwide euphoria. Sales figures not only rebounded, but went on to surpass what the brand had been doing prior to the switch.

23:08.000 --> 23:20.000
In just six months, Coca-Cola was selling more than twice as fast as Pepsi, solidifying their place as the top soda company in the world, a position they continue to hold to this day.

23:20.000 --> 23:31.000
Somehow, the biggest failure in industry history had directly contributed to its biggest success, a story so perfect that it led many to wonder whether it was planned all along.

23:31.000 --> 23:38.000
The incident sparked a variety of other Coke-spiracies as to the company's true intentions with the new formula.

23:38.000 --> 23:48.000
Some speculated that the change was a response to the Reagan administration's war on drugs, with Coke having to phase out the last remnants of the Coca plant from which they're named.

23:49.000 --> 24:00.000
Whether or not this was the case remains dubious, but a far more likely explanation had to do with the company shifting from cane sugar to the far cheaper alternative of high fructose corn syrup.

24:00.000 --> 24:10.000
Strangely enough, Coke Classic wasn't exactly the same as Classic Coke. The returning formula had entirely switched to using corn syrup as a sweetener.

24:10.000 --> 24:16.000
Gay mullins who received the very first can of Coke Classic reported feeling sick after drinking it.

24:16.000 --> 24:25.000
Many other astute consumers had their suspicions about the apparent bait-and-switch, but for the vast majority, it simply didn't matter.

24:25.000 --> 24:31.000
They had complained and Coke had listened, which, at the end of the day, is all anyone really wanted.

24:32.000 --> 24:43.000
In 2009, Coca-Cola officially dropped the word classic from their packaging, effectively erasing the last trace of New Coke's existence.

24:43.000 --> 24:49.000
The company was surely eager to move on from such an embarrassing chapter of their history.

24:49.000 --> 24:54.000
Since then, the debacle has mostly faded away into a distant memory.

25:02.000 --> 25:08.000
A forbidden elixir which caused so much heartache that it was practically banished from public consumption.

25:08.000 --> 25:12.000
An artifact so unwanted that it became unobtainable.

25:12.000 --> 25:21.000
I've spent the past month trying to study it, and after examining just about every aspect of the stuff, I was still missing one crucial detail.

25:21.000 --> 25:27.000
For as much research I've done, the literature, the footage, and the data don't tell the full story.

25:28.000 --> 25:35.000
After dedicating so much effort trying to understand New Coke, the only thing left to do was taste it.

25:35.000 --> 25:37.000
How do you even drink that?

25:37.000 --> 25:38.000
Because it's delicious.

25:38.000 --> 25:39.000
What?

25:39.000 --> 25:47.000
In 2019, New Coke experienced a brief revival after being featured on the hit Netflix series Stranger Things.

25:47.000 --> 25:53.000
As part of a promotional stunt, Coca-Cola would release a limited run of the 1985 formula.

25:54.000 --> 25:59.000
Only 500,000 cans were distributed, with a few winding up for resale on eBay.

25:59.000 --> 26:07.000
So I picked up a case, and for the first time in my life, tried the flavor that whipped an entire nation into a frenzy.

26:07.000 --> 26:12.000
And to be perfectly honest, it was kind of hard to taste the difference.

26:12.000 --> 26:17.000
It's probably because I don't drink soda often, or that I hadn't tasted a Coke in a while.

26:17.000 --> 26:20.000
But I could barely tell the two drinks apart.

26:20.000 --> 26:27.000
Funnily enough, even a guy like Gay Mullins, New Coke's most ardent critic, couldn't tell either.

26:27.000 --> 26:35.000
After finally experiencing the world's most infamous beverage for myself, I couldn't help but speculate about a pretty absurd thought.

26:35.000 --> 26:39.000
Does anyone actually know what Coca-Cola tastes like?

26:39.000 --> 26:45.000
It seems like such a preposterous thing to suggest, but research tells us that most people don't.

26:45.000 --> 26:54.000
Unlike what the marketing may tell you, independent taste tests have consistently shown that the average person can't tell the difference between Coke and Pepsi.

26:54.000 --> 26:58.000
For most of us, taste is just not our strong suit.

26:58.000 --> 27:06.000
Food marketing professor Joel Dubow found that incremental adjustments to soft drink flavor tend to go unnoticed by consumers,

27:06.000 --> 27:12.000
meaning that New Coke could have theoretically succeeded had it been gradually consolidated with the old formula.

27:13.000 --> 27:20.000
This is especially interesting, since many people today believe that New Coke failed because it was a bad product.

27:20.000 --> 27:24.000
But in my personal assessment, that's simply not the case.

27:24.000 --> 27:31.000
In fact, after going back and really comparing the two drinks, I actually preferred the flavor of the new formula.

27:31.000 --> 27:36.000
It was good enough to where I wouldn't mind seeing it return as a permanent option.

27:36.000 --> 27:44.000
The product itself was fine, and had it been executed a little differently, it could have been just as successful as any other Coke flavor.

27:44.000 --> 27:50.000
The problem with New Coke had to do almost entirely with how it was presented to the public.

27:50.000 --> 27:57.000
Coke may have envisioned the product as the ultimate answer to the Pepsi challenge, but they only ended up challenging themselves.

27:57.000 --> 28:05.000
The very idea of replacing the most legendary consumer product in history was just too brazen for the public to accept.

28:05.000 --> 28:14.000
New Coke was unknowingly pitted against 99 years of marketing genius, and in hindsight, it's unsurprising to see which side prevailed.

28:14.000 --> 28:20.000
At the end of the day, all the research, focus groups, and taste tests were irrelevant.

28:20.000 --> 28:24.000
New Coke never stood a chance for the simple reason that it wasn't the real thing.

28:24.000 --> 28:27.000
It wasn't Coca-Cola.

28:27.000 --> 28:30.000
But what is Coca-Cola, really?

28:30.000 --> 28:32.000
Is it carbonated sugar water?

28:32.000 --> 28:35.000
Is it 19th century headache tonic?

28:35.000 --> 28:40.000
I've got a feeling that for most people, Coke isn't even supposed to taste good.

28:40.000 --> 28:44.000
All it has to do is taste how they remember.

28:44.000 --> 28:49.000
There's something to be said about a product that has lasted longer than virtually any other.

28:49.000 --> 28:53.000
One that persists, unchanging, from generation to generation.

28:53.000 --> 29:01.000
It's the comforting assurance that no matter how different the world becomes, there will be at least one thing that stays the same.

29:01.000 --> 29:04.000
That is the essence of the real thing.

29:04.000 --> 29:12.000
And no matter how good New Coke tasted, it was no match for just how much that old formula meant to so many people.

29:12.000 --> 29:16.000
In consumer society, people don't have much.

29:16.000 --> 29:23.000
Decades of marketing have all but replaced sincere human interaction with a superficial facade of products.

29:23.000 --> 29:27.000
Take away those products, and you erase the soul of modern man.

29:28.000 --> 29:34.000
When it was all said and done, Coca-Cola and the entire business world learned a valuable lesson.

29:34.000 --> 29:40.000
If you have a formula that's worked for almost a century, it's probably best to stick with it.

29:57.000 --> 29:59.000
More people prefer the new taste of Coke over Pepsi.

29:59.000 --> 30:00.000
Let's take a look.

30:00.000 --> 30:01.000
Good idea.

30:01.000 --> 30:03.000
Pepsi drinkers, now's your chance. Become a Cokeologist.

30:03.000 --> 30:05.000
That's the way!
