0	5000	Viewer discretion is advised.
11000	14000	Because YouTube audiences generally love to hate on stuff.
14000	18000	As a matter of fact, I'm going to predict that this video is going to get a shitload of views
18000	20000	because I'm being critical of another YouTuber.
20000	24000	This is a good video. It's called Enough is Enough. It's about meme theory.
24000	27000	My homie, Emp Lemon's meme theory videos.
27000	29000	But there's a little news from the Memeverse.
29000	34000	Emperor Lemon made a funny video about why behind the meme is not that good of a YouTube page.
34000	36000	Emperor Lemon downward spiral.
36000	37000	Downward spiral.
37000	38000	Downward spiral.
40000	42000	Do I have everybody's attention now?
44000	54000	So, a couple months ago I uploaded this video and so far it has, without a doubt, become the most interesting video on my channel because of how people reacted.
54000	60000	Within two weeks, this video simultaneously became my most liked and most hated video.
60000	67000	I mean, I've always had a divided audience on basically everything I've uploaded since 2014, but never to this extent.
67000	73000	Back in the day, everyone arguing in my comment sections were doing so within the realm of my own little bubble of content.
73000	78000	But with this video, I seem to have punched into a new level of YouTube.
78000	87000	And out of this new audience, I gained a lot of respect and admiration from my peers and I experienced the fastest subscriber growth rate in seven years of this channel.
87000	91000	However, I also became vociferously hated by a large chunk of people.
91000	96000	This video really stirred the pot for some people. I mean, a lot of people were pissed off.
96000	102000	I received criticism about basically every aspect of the video, but one of the biggest talking points was,
102000	109000	Why, Amp? Why would you make a 30 plus minute video about behind the meme? What exactly was your goal here?
109000	116000	The guy's just making videos about memes. He's not actually hurting anyone. They're not doing anything wrong.
116000	122000	Why do you care about this stupid, innocuous thing so much? Well, let me tell you.
122000	129000	I'm originally a YouTube pooper and I've been making YouTube poops for seven years now. Still do, actually.
129000	134000	Now, depending on the person I tell that to, they're either impressed or confused. Why impressed?
134000	141000	Because YouTube poops take a lot of creativity and patience, which causes most poopers to quit long before the time I've lasted.
141000	149000	Why confused? Because so many people are under the impression that YouTube poops are still the same as they were back in 2009.
149000	154000	And they wonder, how can someone make videos about Weegee toast pingas dinner for seven years?
154000	160000	It's a misconception that really grinds my gears because it stems from a thought process of pure ignorance.
160000	167000	It's a refusal to accept that YTPs are diverse as well as a refusal to accept that YTPs change over time.
167000	173000	You know, like every single other contemporary art movement, but nobody views YTPs as such.
173000	176000	They just aren't respected because they have poop in the title.
176000	180000	People will just watch Sky had a Weegee and assume that all poops are like that.
180000	187000	And even the few brave souls who venture beyond that still refuse to try anything new or slightly out of their comfort zone.
187000	194000	They yearn for the older days of Durham Rocker or Orpheus, and bemoan how all modern YTPs suck,
194000	200000	despite the fact that if you actually open your fucking eyes, poops nowadays are better than they have ever been,
200000	209000	and they beat the YTP is dead drum, all while failing to realize that YouTube Poop's ability to consistently renew its approaches
209000	216000	and methodologies is what makes it great, and what prevents it from becoming yet another stale, overblown fad.
216000	221000	Remember montage parodies? They all stayed the same as the day they first got popular.
221000	225000	They never ventured from the same memes and same style of humor.
225000	231000	They stayed in all your favorite little cozy comfort zones of what you self-professed internet critics find humorous.
231000	237000	And guess what? No one makes montage parodies anymore, but people still make YouTube Poops.
237000	242000	I don't understand why they try, considering they're just gonna get ass-blasted with derision,
242000	248000	reminding them how they'll never be as good as some guy from 2011 who hasn't made a video in half a decade,
248000	256000	or have their entire efforts dismissed by nonchalant viewer number 9000 who thinks it's just gonna be 10 minutes of spaghetti toast dinner theater,
256000	262000	and they have to tolerate all of this, while videos with a single fucking edit get 10,000 times more views and praise.
262000	267000	Honestly, I don't know why the fuck I got popular making YouTube Poops after 2009.
267000	273000	Everywhere I look, I'm reminded that I didn't get popular because of YouTube Poop, but in spite of YouTube Poop.
273000	281000	And I have tried for years to spread the modicum of popularity I had with other poopers who really deserved it, but didn't get as lucky as I did.
281000	288000	And nobody fucking cared. I couldn't even get my audience, people who watch YouTube Poops, to watch other people's YTPs.
288000	293000	People are just so fucking set in their ways that they aren't willing to give these videos a chance.
293000	297000	So I'd given up, which is why there wasn't a top YTPs list for 2016.
297000	300000	But then, along the way, I caught a tiny glimmer of hope.
300000	305000	I saw that this guy called BehindTheMeme made a video explaining YouTube Poops.
305000	311000	This guy with a built-in audience of hundreds of thousands of eager fans is finally gonna set the record straight.
311000	318000	Finally, after all these years, the misconceptions and ignorance surrounding YouTube Poop is finally gonna get put to rest.
318000	327000	And then I watched the video, and it wasn't good. It wasn't even okay. It was bad. It was fucking bad.
327000	333000	Every misconception that people had about YouTube Poops had not been refuted, but reinforced.
333000	338000	BehindTheMeme had the power to do something really good here, to rejuvenate a fledgling art form.
338000	345000	But he didn't do that. He did the opposite. He put forward a low-effort, robotic, poorly-researched farce of a video.
345000	350000	Thanks for watching, and thanks for the ad revenue. Now on to the next meme.
350000	355000	And that was my main point of the BehindTheMeme video. His content fucking sucks.
355000	361000	BehindTheMeme makes bad content, yet everyone seems to be okay with it.
361000	367000	My point with this video was not that normies shouldn't use memes, the only thing everyone seems to be talking about.
367000	380000	My point was that BehindTheMeme was doing a shitty job at explaining them, causing his generally normie audience to have a poor understanding, and thus ruin the memes through misuse and haphazard spam.
380000	383000	And so many people just rushed to defend BehindTheMeme.
383000	386000	All he's doing is explaining the history of memes.
386000	392000	Since when did just doing something become passable for you people? He's doing a bad job.
392000	401000	BehindTheMeme's content is bad. It's just bad. It's lazy, repetitive, uninspired crap that anyone could make.
401000	406000	There's not much separating it from a text-to-speech bot reading off of Know Your Meme articles.
452000	456000	It just baffles me how many people see nothing wrong with this guy's content.
456000	460000	Has YouTube really gotten so shitty that now it's okay to be mediocre?
460000	464000	And that's when it hit me. It has. It fucking has.
464000	471000	YouTube content in general has become so bad that people are willing to believe that BehindTheMeme makes good videos.
471000	478000	When I first discovered YouTube as a kid, I watched stuff like Charlie the Unicorn, PlayWorld, and The Laser Collection.
478000	481000	What the fuck do kids today have to watch on YouTube?
481000	484000	Spider-Man, Elsa, softcore pornography?
484000	488000	Now granted, the stuff I watched didn't exactly have the cinematic merit of Citizen Kane,
488000	492000	but they were original, creatively driven, artistic projects.
492000	498000	They weren't something engineered to suck as much watch time out of young children as physically possible.
498000	502000	Seriously though, what the fuck happened to content on this website?
502000	504000	Now obviously, there's still good content.
504000	506000	If content ain't good, I ain't watching it.
506000	509000	And I still watch a lot of content these days.
509000	514000	YouTube will always have inspired, creative, passionate individuals making content.
514000	516000	It's just a matter of finding them.
516000	522000	I'm able to find them through finely tuned subscriptions and recommendations based off of seven years of search history.
522000	525000	But what about the people who are just starting to watch stuff on this website?
525000	530000	I think it's fair to say that YouTube is populated primarily by young teens and children.
530000	534000	It's hard to tell for sure because everyone just lies about their age anyway.
534000	539000	But if I had to guess, I would estimate that the median age of people on this website is around 15 years old.
539000	545000	That means that the majority of YouTube content consumers today probably weren't around to see content from before 2012.
545000	547000	They don't remember the old days.
547000	551000	Believe it or not, you guys, this website used to be fucking great.
557000	561000	By far the most compelling component to the allure of early YouTube
561000	566000	was the idea that average, regular people could become popular from seemingly out of nowhere.
566000	569000	Take Fred for example, YouTube's first real big star.
569000	572000	He was just some guy making videos in his backyard.
572000	576000	Then three years later he was starring in his own TV movie with John Cena.
576000	582000	What we had here was this brand new platform where anyone with a webcam and Windows movie maker
582000	587000	could broadcast themselves to potentially millions of people from around the world.
587000	592000	The people that first got popular on YouTube were just amateur videographers, animators, and editors.
592000	597000	They weren't A-list movie stars, they didn't have thousands of dollars worth of filmmaking equipment,
597000	601000	and they didn't have decades of professional experience in producing media.
601000	605000	They were just regular people that you could walk past on the street without noticing.
605000	611000	Becoming popular on YouTube or having a video go viral was not just a far-fetched dream, but a tangible goal.
611000	613000	Which brings me to my next point.
618000	626000	In the days of classic YouTube, the only thing separating you from popularity was your own talent, creativity, intellect, and passion.
626000	633000	If you were willing to sit down, buckle your fuckle, and put in the effort to make your content as entertaining as it could be,
633000	636000	then you would get subscribers and views.
636000	641000	Because generally on YouTube at this time, good content and talented people could rise to the top.
641000	649000	Sure, it wouldn't be immediate, but there was a strong sense back then where if you put in the dedication to keep making good content,
649000	651000	you would eventually be validated for it.
651000	656000	If you worked hard enough and your videos were entertaining, you could make it to the top all by yourself.
656000	662000	It was an environment in which real talent, effort, and quality was rewarded with success.
664000	667000	It used to be really easy to discover new content on YouTube.
667000	675000	You used to be able to see whenever one of your subscriptions liked a video or rated a video five stars depending on how old we're talking about.
675000	682000	If you found just one YouTuber whose content you liked, this feature made it easy to branch out and find similar artists.
682000	689000	You could then look out for what those YouTubers liked and so on and so on until you had a network of new people to watch.
689000	696000	This system allowed small channels to gain much more traction early on since they would gain exposure every time a big YouTuber liked one of their videos.
697000	700000	People were also more likely to search for new videos back then.
700000	704000	In those days, YouTubers didn't upload as much and videos were shorter.
704000	709000	This encouraged viewers to go out and search for new content if they wanted to stay entertained.
709000	716000	Part of the actual entertainment of the site was trekking through chains of bizarre videos and poking your head in the weird part of YouTube.
716000	721000	So not only did the mechanics of YouTube allow viewers to discover new videos,
721000	727000	more videos were discovered because YouTube conditioned viewers to go out and explore new content.
729000	737000	It is impossible to describe the greatness of old YouTube without highlighting the wealth of quality, independent animation on the website.
737000	744000	YouTube provided a new generation of amateur animators, a platform on which millions of people could view their artwork.
744000	753000	Animators like Oni, Harry Partridge, and Egoraptor started off on sites like Newgrounds, however reached unprecedented heights through the wider appeal of YouTube.
753000	759000	Animation on YouTube really served as the site's heart and soul for creatively driven artistic content.
759000	765000	YouTube animations as opposed to cartoons on television were wild, radical, and unrestrained.
765000	773000	While most of them weren't necessarily high quality from an animation perspective, they were under the full creative discretion of the animator.
773000	780000	Often times the same individual would write, voice, and animate their projects, leaving them complete creative control.
780000	786000	This made YouTube animation unique as it allowed the full artistic intent of the creator to roam freely.
788000	796000	One aspect that often gets overlooked about early YouTube is how content creators back then were much more honest and down to earth.
796000	802000	YouTubers were much more straightforward back in the day because there wasn't as much of an incentive to run your channel like a business.
802000	811000	Before 2010, YouTube as a whole didn't draw that much ad revenue, so the YouTube Partner Program was much more exclusive, only granted to the highest viewed channels.
811000	818000	So for the vast majority of content producers, they just made content with the intention of making good, memorable videos.
818000	825000	Going back to the independent YouTube animators, you could tell that the jokes and comedy in their videos reflected their actual senses of humor.
826000	829000	YouTubers back then just kind of did stuff that they wanted to do.
829000	834000	They were interested and invested in their own content, which made the content better overall.
834000	838000	They weren't afraid of projecting their own opinions and personality into their work.
838000	849000	This made YouTubers much more personal, connected, and empathetic than conventional celebrities because the videos and person behind the videos often operated on the same ideological engine.
849000	854000	Creators didn't seek out audiences as much, rather audiences sought out YouTubers.
854000	862000	This allowed YouTubers from the old days to present their content genuinely and honestly without fear of being tossed aside for speaking their minds.
865000	871000	It's interesting to consider that early YouTube was an unprecedented new paradigm of entertainment.
871000	877000	I say unprecedented because back in the day, nobody really knew what could and couldn't get popular on YouTube.
877000	881000	There wasn't a set-in-stone formula for how to maximize your clicks.
881000	886000	Everyone just kind of had to do trial and error, throw whatever shit they could at the wall and see what stuck.
886000	891000	This experimentation led to some of the most original and creative videos this site has ever seen.
891000	896000	Now of course, this also led to a lot of shitty, terrible, god-awful videos, but that was part of the fun.
896000	902000	YouTube was a mixed bag, and it ultimately made browsing videos an inherently interesting experience.
902000	905000	Videos back then were much more spontaneous and unexpected.
905000	909000	Sure, most of them weren't good, but it kept you on your toes.
909000	917000	The content was diverse, and there was a constant pressure for YouTubers to think outside the box and renew their techniques rather than becoming complacent and stale.
920000	929000	Speaking from a personal perspective, the main reason I started using YouTube for the majority of my entertainment consumption was because it was simply better than television.
929000	935000	I started watching YouTube videos in 2006, and I became a frequent visitor on YouTube by 2009.
935000	941000	Ever since then, I've watched videos on YouTube for basically every single day, 365 days a year.
941000	943000	I used to do the same thing with television.
943000	946000	My favorite channels growing up were Nickelodeon and Cartoon Network.
946000	956000	And it just so happened that around 2009, when I transitioned primarily to watching YouTube, both Nickelodeon and Cartoon Network were churning out some pretty mediocre shows.
956000	964000	So I thought, why would I wait for these television networks to deliver me content I want to see when I can just go out and find it on YouTube?
964000	967000	YouTube was just so much of an improvement over television back then.
967000	977000	Instead of having to watch what was available, basic programming for general audiences, I could seek out whatever content that appealed to my specific entertainment tastes.
977000	982000	And to make things better, the content on YouTube was made by regular people like me.
982000	990000	And that depth of connection allowed me to enjoy the content to a special extent that was never possible through television or cinema.
990000	996000	And those, ladies and gentlemen, were the seven reasons why YouTube used to be fucking great.
996000	1007000	Now I want you to take a good long look at those seven things while I carefully explain to you how, in less than a decade, YouTube has managed to completely fuck up every single one of them.
1007000	1011000	Because YouTube has been on a downward spiral.
1020000	1028000	Downward spiral.
1033000	1039000	So if you want to make it big on YouTube these days, well you better get used to those fucking rags. It's not happening.
1039000	1042000	Remember when I said that becoming popular on YouTube was a tangible goal?
1042000	1052000	Well buddy, if you want to get popular on YouTube these days from scratch, then you're probably better off auditioning for Hollywood or playing the lottery than trying to make it on the site in 2017.
1052000	1066000	Because in order to compete with all the vapid shit the site pumps out on a daily basis, you better be prepared to bust your ass working around the clock for basically non-existent wages on videos that will probably be overshadowed by some guy more popular than you.
1067000	1073000	Every idea that you could possibly think of has already been done a thousand-fold by some guys more popular than you.
1073000	1082000	And even if you manage to think of an idea or series that is completely new and original, some guy more popular than you will steal that idea and take all the glory.
1082000	1087000	YouTube has stagnated into a power class system similar to that of Victorian England.
1087000	1096000	Upward mobility is practically impossible. You either have to be a pre-established celebrity or suck a popular YouTuber's cock if you want any hope of working your way up the ranks.
1096000	1107000	Of course, you could always sell out and attempt to ride some popular trend to the top. Enjoy your two-month spike of popularity until you get labeled a one-trick pony and fail to develop any personal impression on your audience.
1107000	1111000	You are now free to ride the stale expressing obscurity.
1112000	1124000	But let's say you're more than just a regular Joe. You're exceptional at something. You have the talent and drive and vision to be better at your thing than almost anyone else in the world.
1124000	1135000	I mean, surely if you're that talented, you can make it big on YouTube, right? Well, you better also be super talented at writing, video production, and editing, or else no one will even take you seriously.
1135000	1138000	Of course, you could just hire somebody to do those things for you.
1138000	1142000	Did I mention that YouTube pays basically nothing unless you're a massive channel?
1142000	1151000	But say you have all of those things. You're talented, charismatic, a good writer, good on camera, and you're capable of editing a video into a polished final product.
1151000	1158000	Congratulations! You've finally unlocked the potential for people to watch you perform your talent, whatever that is.
1158000	1163000	Now just keep pouring your time and effort into producing content for, oh, a couple of years.
1163000	1171000	By this time, some schmuck on Reddit or Tumblr will have noticed one of your videos and shared it in order to farm some free internet points off of your hard work.
1171000	1180000	But hey, your stuff will finally be seen by a bunch of people. Congratulations, you've finally achieved a modicum of success on YouTube.
1180000	1189000	Now comes the best part, as you watch helplessly while the one single popular thing you made gets plundered by talentless reaction channels and compilation channels.
1189000	1194000	All of whom get more views and subscribers than you could possibly ever hope to attain.
1194000	1198000	And hey, some of them might even give you credit for your own work.
1198000	1204000	Because these days, YouTube audiences are too stupid and lazy to care about who makes the content they watch.
1204000	1210000	They just want to be doped up on a constant stream of bright, colorful content, no questions asked.
1210000	1218000	I wish it wasn't so, but how else could your original videos get fewer views than a video of a guy recording himself watching your videos?
1218000	1226000	It may not seem fair, but quit your crying. The reaction and compilation channels are just doing a better job at satisfying the algorithm.
1226000	1230000	Oh yeah, did I mention the ALGORITHM?
1233000	1238000	So remember when people on YouTube actually had to go out and explore the content they wanted to watch?
1238000	1245000	Well, not anymore. Now you can just sit back and relax while the ALGORITHM delivers you all the content you should be watching.
1246000	1254000	No user input required. Just click on your homepage and YouTube will recommend you all the videos that they know you'll like watching.
1254000	1263000	Oh, what's that? You want to watch your subscriptions? You know, the channels that you already like for sure to the extent that you want to be notified of their future uploads?
1263000	1267000	Well, fuck you! You don't know what you like! But the ALGORITHM does!
1267000	1271000	So we're setting your homepage to default. Fuck subscriptions!
1271000	1277000	It's also good to know that YouTube has removed the ability to see videos that your favorite YouTubers liked and shared,
1277000	1282000	and they even removed the little drop-down tab that showed the video uploader's other videos.
1282000	1288000	Now if you find a channel that you like, you have to click on their channel icon, and then click on the videos tab if you want to see their videos.
1288000	1296000	It's like two extra clicks, but I'm sure the lazy, inattentive, modern-day YouTube audience would be happy to comply with those additional steps.
1296000	1301000	Because the more steps separating you from the content you want to see, the merrier.
1301000	1308000	But hey, at least YouTube added a default auto-play feature so that the ALGORITHM can feed you a video in zero clicks!
1308000	1317000	No need to explore new channels! Why go out and search for small, up-and-coming channels when the ALGORITHM can feed you videos from YouTubers who are already rich and successful?
1317000	1323000	But YouTube really does care about its small channels having their videos discovered, which is why they added the TRENDING tab!
1323000	1326000	Oh wait, the TRENDING tab doesn't actually feature trending videos?
1326000	1331000	Oh wait, the TRENDING tab is composed of videos completely cherry-picked by YouTube?
1331000	1333000	Well, are they at least helping out small YouTubers?
1333000	1342000	Oh wait, the TRENDING tab only features the same 100 or so popular YouTube channels as well as celebrities, pop stars, and TV shows that are already famous!
1353000	1372000	Well, sorry, small channels. At least you still have the trusty method of graffiti-ing your channel name on the inside of bathroom stalls.
1372000	1377000	Oh, you idiot! What the fuck?
1377000	1382000	Man, isn't the ALGORITHM great?
1382000	1394000	Turns out the algorithm wasn't so great for pretty much every single independent animator on YouTube.
1394000	1399000	Here's a little YouTube history lesson for you guys. The algorithm we have today wasn't the original one.
1399000	1404000	YouTube's first algorithm recommended videos based on view count and video tags.
1404000	1409000	You know, those keywords you stick to a video when you upload it? Yeah, those actually used to mean something.
1409000	1415000	Sure, the old algorithm wasn't perfect, but it generally allowed better videos to get more views.
1415000	1423000	And by using tags to sort recommended videos, the old algorithm made it easier to chain videos together about similar topics.
1423000	1433000	Nowadays, videos are sorted as broadly as the fucking category, which is why you still get recommended pyrocynical videos even though you've done nothing but watch TF2 videos for three days.
1433000	1443000	Yeah, to no surprise, people abuse the fuck out of the system when they can. Which is pretty ironic, considering that's the reason YouTube changed the original algorithm to what we have now.
1443000	1447000	Apparently people were just spamming their videos with a wide range of tags.
1447000	1454000	And I think it also had something to do with some girls with boobs who made some reaction videos or something?
1454000	1460000	But anyway, YouTube changed the algorithm so that video success would be based on watch time and not view count.
1461000	1467000	Wow, it sure is nice to see that changing the algorithm got rid of clickbaity reaction videos.
1467000	1474000	But a consequence of the algorithm change that actually affected people was the extinction of animation on YouTube.
1474000	1481000	Animation is a long, time-consuming process that results in a high-quality product with high rewatchability.
1481000	1489000	Prior to the algorithm change, YouTube animators relied on their videos receiving a high volume of views to offset the infrequency of their uploads.
1489000	1496000	Since most animations are short, the algorithm change made it so that animations would only receive a fraction of the views that they did before.
1496000	1501000	So through one simple change in a line of code, YouTube made animation completely unprofitable.
1501000	1504000	But hey, at least we got Let's Plays!
1504000	1510000	Now don't get me wrong, I think Game Grumps is an okay channel. For what they do, it's adequate content.
1510000	1514000	But what a lot of people forget is that Egoraptor made great animations.
1514000	1522000	Was it really worth it to give up an excellent animation every few weeks in order to watch Aaron play video games for a half an hour every single day?
1522000	1526000	Sure, it was amusing at first, but don't people get tired of this stuff?
1526000	1529000	And they did, because I don't care how good your content is.
1529000	1534000	Regular people aren't physically able to sit through half an hour of it every single goddamn day.
1534000	1537000	There's just too much content to go around.
1537000	1544000	If you're subscribed to like five Let's Play channels, that's like between two to four hours of content every single day depending on who you sub to.
1544000	1548000	Fuck that shit, just give me the fifteen minutes of great animation a week.
1548000	1553000	By changing the algorithm, YouTube encouraged a system that favored quantity over quality.
1553000	1557000	And this was the beginning of the downfall for this fucking website.
1557000	1569000	Remember how I said that YouTube used to be populated with genuine personalities who cared about the quality of their content?
1569000	1570000	Well, not anymore!
1570000	1575000	Quality on YouTube in 2017? Quality doesn't matter anymore.
1575000	1578000	Being genuine and honest doesn't matter anymore.
1578000	1584000	The only thing that matters now on this website is the number of ads that you can cram into your viewers' brains.
1584000	1591000	Now, I understand that YouTube is ultimately a business, and I have nothing wrong with people building their wealth by making YouTube videos.
1591000	1593000	In fact, I encourage it.
1593000	1601000	But when everyone starts strictly operating their YouTube channels like a business, there are core elements of this website that become lost.
1601000	1606000	Nearly all videos these days just seem so detached and disingenuous.
1606000	1612000	It seems like almost everyone has to dumb down their content in order to cater to more general audiences.
1612000	1615000	YouTubers are just so fake these days, it's almost sickening.
1615000	1620000	It's like living in a city populated entirely by lawyers, politicians, and car salesmen.
1620000	1623000	Everywhere you go on this website, someone's trying to sell you something.
1623000	1630000	If they're not trying to sell you razors, ebooks, or monthly crates, they're hell-bent on trying to sell you a subscription to their channel.
1630000	1631000	Hey, can you subscribe?
1631000	1636000	Make sure to subscribe, and like, and share, and subscribe, and subscribe!
1636000	1638000	Please fucking subscribe!
1639000	1650000	I swear to fucking Christ, if one more fucking YouTuber tells me to subscribe to them, I'm going to descend to a never-before-seen depth of my own personal downward mental spiral.
1650000	1653000	Seriously, people, enough is enough!
1653000	1655000	Enough is fucking enough!
1655000	1666000	Do you really think that people don't know how to press the fucking subscribe button to the extent that you have to remind them at the end of every fucking video?
1666000	1668000	And every YouTuber does this now.
1668000	1669000	Why?
1669000	1672000	If people like you, they'll subscribe.
1672000	1676000	You don't have to remind them every single chance you get.
1676000	1681000	Has there ever been a single instance where someone has been watching a video and they're like,
1681000	1688000	Gee, I really like this YouTuber, but if only there was an easier way to find out whenever they upload new videos.
1688000	1690000	Just subscribe, boss. Just subscribe, boss.
1690000	1691000	Make sure you subscribe.
1691000	1693000	If you are not subscribed, guys, press that subscribe button.
1693000	1695000	If you are not around here, subscribe!
1695000	1699000	Oh yeah, I can subscribe.
1699000	1701000	Thanks for reminding me.
1701000	1705000	When has that sequence of events ever transpired in the history of this website?
1705000	1713000	This site is like over a billion active users, and I can't fathom that mental conversation ever taking place.
1713000	1720000	And fine, let's just imagine that you're a dumb enough fuck not to know the function of the subscribe button.
1720000	1728000	Well, in that case, I wouldn't want you subscribed to me anyway, because you'd be too much of an adult to understand my content in the first place.
1728000	1732000	Why the fuck do YouTubers have to constantly coax people to subscribe?
1732000	1734000	We should be asking people to unsubscribe.
1734000	1737000	That's what people actually need to be told to do.
1737000	1739000	Lord knows I try.
1739000	1748000	But no, YouTubers these days need to pander to, beg for, and cling on to every single last shred of a subscriber they can manage to scrounge up.
1748000	1752000	And God forbid you even think of speaking your mind on anything.
1752000	1758000	Everyone has to reduce their personalities to the equivalent of a stale piece of toast on top of a cardboard box.
1758000	1761000	YouTube today isn't about telling people what you want them to hear.
1761000	1764000	It's about telling them what they want you to say.
1764000	1767000	YouTube audiences don't want to be challenged anymore.
1767000	1772000	They just want to get doped up on some polished, sparkly, inoffensive content.
1772000	1777000	Why else would content like Buzzfeed, WatchMojo, and Fine Bros be so successful?
1777000	1782000	It just astounds me how the type of person who would go on Facebook and complain,
1782000	1788000	Oh my God, how can people watch the Kardashians? How can people listen to Katy Perry? How can people eat at McDonald's?
1788000	1790000	How can people have such bad taste?
1790000	1794000	And then they turn around and watch half an hour of Buzzfeed videos.
1794000	1797000	It's the same fucking shit. Do you people not realize that?
1797000	1800000	Congratulations. You played yourself.
1800000	1806000	Can I ask something to you people out there who actually watch Buzzfeed or Fine Bros or WatchMojo and enjoy the content?
1806000	1812000	How does it feel? How does it feel knowing you're consuming videos fabricated by some corporate suit in a boardroom
1812000	1816000	who specifically designs their content to appeal to saps like you?
1816000	1822000	And how does it feel to realize that you're such a predictable simpleton that it works and you eat that shit up?
1822000	1825000	So go ahead. Keep watching the Buzzfeeds of YouTube.
1825000	1832000	The faceless corporate entities who view you people as nothing more than walking dollar signs.
1832000	1840000	Keep pouring views and watch time into them rather than supporting independent, individually operated channels who actually care about their audiences.
1840000	1843000	Why do people nowadays strive to be like the next fucking Buzzfeed?
1843000	1847000	Why aren't there more people trying to be like the next Vsauce or the next video game Dunkey?
1847000	1856000	Oh wait, people try to do that only to get slaughtered in view count by the torrent of vapid and unstimulating dreck that this site turns out on a daily basis.
1856000	1862000	God, it's absolutely disgusting the extent to which this website has lost its heart and soul.
1862000	1865000	But wait, I'm not done yet.
1868000	1875000	Every popular video on modern YouTube has to be cloned from the same couple of identical cookie cutter templates.
1875000	1878000	Here's how to open a popular YouTube channel in 2017.
1878000	1886000	First you gotta pay some guy to divvy you up a shiny, whooshy, whooshy, cool looking 3D intro in After Effects while you blast some obnoxious EDM bass drop.
1889000	1891000	Now you get to choose your YouTube skill tree.
1891000	1896000	You can either become a gaming channel, a commentary channel, or a list channel.
1896000	1900000	Gaming channel's easy. You just record yourself playing a game for a couple of hours.
1900000	1906000	They say it helps if you have charisma or dynamic speaking skills, but that's just a bunch of bullshit.
1906000	1910000	All you gotta do is scream really loudly and curse every 2.5 seconds.
1910000	1913000	Anything less frequent than that and the kiddies won't be entertained.
1913000	1922000	Just kidding! You could have your goldfish commentate your let's play and 90% of YouTube viewers will still watch it because they'd rather watch someone play a game than play one themselves.
1922000	1935000	Now take that massive chunk of raw gaming footage you just recorded, chop it up into 10 minute intervals, slap on an intro and end screen to each part with minimal or non-existent editing, and congratulations!
1935000	1939000	You have now produced enough content for a month's worth of daily uploads.
1939000	1941000	So what if you want to do commentary videos?
1941000	1949000	Well, just repeat the same process of making a gaming video and just record yourself talking over it with a completely unrelated topic for 10 minutes.
1949000	1957000	It helps if you make a big giant stink over a topic that realistically doesn't matter because people really seem to care about that.
1957000	1961000	And make sure to set the category of the video to gaming because you're totally gaming, right?
1961000	1963000	Soon you'll be raking in those clicks.
1963000	1970000	Alternatively, you could just talk over a movie or TV show and talk about how much you vociferously HANED IT.
1970000	1976000	Man, isn't it amazing how skilled we as a society have become at tearing media to shreds?
1976000	1985000	Gosh, I never knew how much every single movie, TV show, cartoon, video game, and song is the absolute scourge of humanity.
1985000	1987000	But YouTube content?
1987000	1988000	It's all good.
1988000	1990000	Nothing to criticize here.
1990000	1995000	Hey, as long as they're just doing their own thing, it must be great content.
1995000	1997000	Just ignore it, bro.
1997000	2005000	Meanwhile, let's go back to hating on this bad movie made by like one unknown guy on a shoestring budget who's probably shot himself by now.
2005000	2008000	They've gotta be held accountable for their crimes against humanity.
2008000	2010000	Priorities, guys!
2010000	2012000	Anyway, what the fuck else is there to do on this website?
2012000	2014000	Oh yeah, list videos.
2014000	2018000	Just arbitrarily rank and arrange random shit in a list.
2018000	2020000	Research and fact-checking is optional.
2020000	2029000	In fact, you probably shouldn't even attempt to do that stuff because it'll just slow you down from making a list video on every single possible permutation of ideas in existence.
2029000	2032000	So just hastily cobble together whatever dumb shit you can.
2032000	2037000	Pump out 200 lists a year and hope one of them gets arbitrarily picked up by the algorithm.
2037000	2039000	And make sure each video is ten minutes.
2039000	2042000	TEN MINUTES.
2042000	2046000	So that you can earn that extra AD revenue.
2046000	2048000	Because that's really what this is all about.
2048000	2053000	What, you think people make all these same videos over and over again because they're fun?
2053000	2054000	Fuck no!
2054000	2058000	YouTube stopped being about having fun a long time ago.
2058000	2066000	The reason these same videos are fucking everywhere is because you people pour watch time into them regardless of whether or not you're entertained.
2066000	2068000	You zombies validate this system.
2068000	2076000	And you make it so that these specific video templates are the only profitable means of video production because they're low-effort, high-volume videos.
2076000	2082000	And what we've done here is constrain the profitability of YouTube videos to these parameters.
2082000	2083000	But that's just the beginning.
2083000	2090000	Not only must videos be low-effort, mass-produced, frequently uploaded, and over ten minutes to succeed in 2017,
2090000	2093000	they can't be too long either or people will lose interest.
2093000	2099000	Because god forbid anyone in this generation has an attention span longer than that of a fucking goldfish,
2099000	2104000	the number of fuckers complaining that my Behind the Meme video was too long made me realize this.
2104000	2114000	Sure, the same pinheads who've gladly watched some dude play Minecraft for 24 minutes are unable to sit through 30 minutes of a structured and detailed argument with consistent visual editing.
2114000	2117000	But I guess that's my fault too, right?
2117000	2119000	YOU FUCKING BITCH!
2119000	2121000	Oh yeah, that's another thing.
2121000	2125000	YouTube viewers don't like to think, and YouTube viewers don't like to be challenged.
2125000	2129000	Make sure your videos are as dumbed down and simplistic as possible.
2129000	2133000	You should make your dialogue so basic that a third grader could understand it.
2133000	2137000	Because let's face it, they probably make up a majority of your viewers anyway.
2137000	2142000	So rather than encourage them to elevate themselves to a level worthy of intellectual discussion,
2142000	2145000	it's just easier to shut off about half of your brain cells because
2145000	2148000	GOD FORBID WE DON'T ACT INCLUSIVELY
2148000	2151000	towards every slack-jawed idiot with an internet connection.
2151000	2157000	We gotta sync to their level to make sure they're nice and comfy and don't have to use their brains.
2157000	2160000	So yeah, don't make your content too advanced either.
2160000	2164000	And also make sure you only talk about innocuous and vapid topics in all your videos.
2164000	2169000	Because anything more extreme than that will be considered non-advertiser friendly.
2169000	2177000	That's right, YouTube themselves will financially sandbag your video if you dare to entertain any audience above the age of 9.
2177000	2183000	They saw a new generation of YouTubers like Filthy Frank and iDubbbz succeeding by making edgy, raunchy content
2183000	2186000	that appealed to an older, previously disenfranchised audience.
2186000	2188000	Well fuck them, right?
2188000	2194000	They saw a new paradigm of journalism forming with a rise of independently operated news channels
2194000	2198000	that could disseminate information free from the control of mainstream media.
2198000	2200000	Well fuck them too.
2200000	2203000	Some disgraced Wall Street Journal guy called PewDiePie and Nazi.
2203000	2206000	And now Coke and Pepsi will only run ads on toy reviews.
2206000	2212000	So fuck literally every single small YouTuber who had a dream of succeeding on this website through original content.
2212000	2216000	Hey, at least Coke, Pepsi, and YouTube kept their good PR.
2216000	2218000	Thanks for taking one for the team, guys.
2218000	2221000	Man, isn't economic censorship fun?
2221000	2223000	So let's review, shall we?
2223000	2228000	If you want to run a profitable channel on YouTube, your videos have to be limited to three different templates
2228000	2235000	of ten to fifteen minute, low effort, high volume content that's dumbed down, neutered, and pandering
2235000	2238000	towards the most generalized audience of simpletons.
2238000	2243000	So if you're wondering why all the videos on modern YouTube kind of feel the same, this is why.
2243000	2248000	Because YouTube has fabricated a system where only one type of video can succeed.
2248000	2253000	Wait a minute, high volume, dumbed down content pandering to general audiences?
2253000	2256000	Well that's just fucking television!
2259000	2263000	And that, ladies and gentlemen, is the raw, barebones, unadulterated truth.
2263000	2268000	Through all these changes that YouTube has gone through in the past five years, YouTube has lost its heart,
2268000	2275000	it's lost its soul, it's lost every aspect that made it a unique and distinct entertainment platform.
2275000	2279000	And now, YouTube has become nothing more than television.
2279000	2281000	Just television, but shittier.
2281000	2286000	Because at least everything on TV has high production value, YouTube ain't got that.
2286000	2292000	Unless you count obnoxious 3D EDM intros, and television only has a couple hundred channels,
2292000	2297000	so there's little overlapping content, and each TV channel is fairly distinct in its programming.
2297000	2302000	YouTube has a million channels, and the majority of them are making the same exact videos.
2302000	2306000	It's just amazing how much YouTube wants to be like television.
2306000	2311000	They ripped off YouTube Gaming from Twitch, they ripped off YouTube Red from Netflix,
2311000	2314000	they ripped off YouTube TV from fucking TV!
2314000	2317000	Why not understand Google's business strategy here?
2317000	2322000	Why not try to become distinct from your competitors, rather than making shittier versions of their products?
2322000	2328000	Need I remind them of Google Plus, their completely disastrous attempt to copy Facebook?
2328000	2331000	Thanks for trying to force it down our throats for two years, by the way.
2331000	2334000	Glad to see that it wasn't a complete waste of human resources.
2334000	2337000	But I guess YouTube is hell-bent on being television now,
2337000	2343000	even though it can't possibly hope to compete with cable, or even Netflix in terms of quality.
2343000	2349000	TV and Netflix have programming made by professional writers and producers, the best in the world.
2349000	2351000	YouTube is just a bunch of amateurs!
2351000	2358000	Instead of highlighting the novelty quirks and creative freedom that come with independent amateur video makers, like they used to do,
2358000	2365000	YouTube has decided to bottleneck all of its individuality into a system which forces everyone to be the same,
2365000	2368000	and iron out all of their strongest traits.
2368000	2375000	I'm sorry, but a bunch of amateur YouTubers making television-like content will never, ever complete with television.
2375000	2377000	Not in a million years!
2377000	2381000	Television is backed by multi-billion dollar media corporations.
2381000	2386000	YouTube is backed by a couple of big soda companies trying to sell ads to kids.
2386000	2388000	You people saw what happened this year.
2388000	2396000	When a tiny minuscule fucking controversy happened, a couple of companies pulled their ads, and this website became absolutely anemic.
2396000	2398000	That shit doesn't happen with television.
2398000	2402000	People who work in television get paid and paid consistently.
2402000	2407000	As for YouTubers, it's becoming less and less of a reality every single day.
2407000	2415000	Content creators have absolutely zero control over how things are run on this website, and we always get the short end of the stick.
2415000	2423000	I've talked about all the shit that's wrong with YouTube so far, and I haven't even mentioned the site's complete failure to protect its creators from abusive copyright claims.
2423000	2429000	I haven't even mentioned the multiple pointless and confusing changes to the site's layout over the years.
2429000	2440000	I haven't even mentioned YouTube's complete lack of transparency, often making drastic changes with little to no community feedback, all while offering minuscule explanations about it all.
2440000	2454000	I haven't mentioned those times when YouTube inexplicably broke the comment section, or when they inexplicably broke subscriber counts, or when they inexplicably started unsubscribing fans from their favorite channels, ALLEGEDLY.
2454000	2458000	All of these topics have been covered already, in-depth, by other people.
2459000	2475000	But the overarching theme with all of these is that YouTube, despite being a giant multi-billion dollar social network, is run by incompetent boobs who make rash, impulsive decisions without any consultation or approval from its users.
2475000	2481000	And every time YouTube fucks up, the content creators are always the ones to have to pick up the slack.
2481000	2485000	Is it fair? No. Could things be any different? Also no.
2485000	2493000	As far as YouTube is concerned, their distinct objective is to deliver ads to eyeballs. Everything else is completely irrelevant to them.
2493000	2501000	They're certainly not going to piss off the advertisers, because they're the ones who pay the bills, and they're going to try to keep ad watchers pretty happy when they can.
2501000	2512000	So that just leaves content creators to get fucked, over, and over, and over, and over, and over, and over, and over, and over, and over, and over, and over, and over, and over, and over, and over, and over again.
2512000	2517000	Don't like it? Well, too bad. What you gonna do? Go to Vimeo? Please.
2517000	2522000	If you actually want your stuff to be seen by more than a dozen people, it's YouTube or Bust.
2522000	2529000	And if you don't bend over and take your monthly YouTube-sanctioned buttfuck, then they'll find someone else who will.
2529000	2534000	People are lining up around the block to replace you and play by YouTube's rules.
2534000	2541000	YouTube has no reason to care about content creators, and if you're just sitting back, relaxing as a viewer, I've got news for you, buddy.
2541000	2550000	YouTube doesn't care about you either, because as soon as the content creators get fucked by YouTube's mistakes, it's the viewers who have to settle for shittier content.
2550000	2555000	At least when content is shitty on television, they can it and replace it with something people actually want to watch.
2555000	2564000	There's no getting rid of bad content on YouTube, because the fucking system that's currently in place encourages it, and viewers don't know where to turn to find anything better.
2564000	2579000	If this was TV, you just changed the channel. But on YouTube, when you try to change channels, you find the same dull, repetitive, uninspired, mass-produced, pandering, profiteering, manipulative garbage, and it's everywhere.
2579000	2584000	You can't escape from it. And the worst part is that there's absolutely nothing we can do about it.
2584000	2591000	The majority of people on the site have become so inundated by the sewage stream of content that they don't even question it.
2591000	2600000	They see channels like Behind the Meme, WatchMojo, BuzzFeed, and Finebros, and they believe that this is the way YouTube content is supposed to be.
2600000	2605000	Because they're not doing anything wrong, so how can they be bad?
2605000	2619000	The state of YouTube is bad, okay? YouTube is unwell right now, and from what I can see, it's headed in a direction that looks to be very detrimental for content creators, viewers, and YouTube itself.
2619000	2628000	Sure, the situation may not seem very dire right now, but if things stay the way they are for ten or even five years, then I just don't know what will happen.
2628000	2634000	But it won't be good. Things may already be starting to fall apart into an irredeemably bad situation.
2634000	2640000	It's becoming more and more difficult for small channels to gain any sort of traction or growth based on hard work alone,
2640000	2648000	while channels at the top of this website get fed views and watch time and ad revenue without having to actively improve or innovate their approaches.
2648000	2660000	I feel like YouTube has developed a system that rewards quantity over quality, and YouTube videos in general are becoming too long while additionally lacking any informative substance.
2660000	2669000	This is causing viewers to watch fewer videos and therefore fewer YouTubers. There's simply too much video content to go around and not enough time.
2669000	2679000	Viewer people are willing to go out and search for new YouTubers because subscribing to the average Let's Play channel already provides them with five hours of video plus a podcast per week.
2679000	2685000	Viewers are getting burnt out trying to watch everything, and small YouTubers are getting burnt out trying to compete with bigger channels.
2685000	2698000	What we have here is a system that's not built to last. YouTube has always been on the edge of control as a viable source of revenue, but never have times been more uncertain as right now and headed into the future.
2698000	2707000	So to anyone out there listening to my words right now, consider this video a warning. I really care about this website and what it represents, or at least what it used to represent.
2707000	2720000	And I am deeply concerned about the future of content creation on YouTube. And if you're like me, and you also care about this website, and you see the problems I see, then you're probably asking right now, what can I do to fix this?
2720000	2732000	And the answer to that is absolutely nothing. Well, at least not by yourself. A useless buzzword hashtag slogan isn't going to fix this. A pointless change.org petition isn't going to fix this.
2732000	2749000	What we have here is a problem that's become so deeply ingrained within the modern culture of YouTube that it's going to take a heavily concerted macro scale effort by advertisers, viewers, creators, and YouTube itself to restore the site to its former glory.
2749000	2759000	And I just don't see it happening, because in all honesty, the vast majority of people don't care. The vast majority of people won't even care enough to watch this video a tenth of the way through.
2759000	2770000	And it's going to take a cataclysmic event to happen before all you fucking zombies even turn your heads. But if you're not a zombie, and you're listening to me right now, then I have a message for you.
2771000	2783000	My message to everyone listening to this right now is to stop tolerating mediocrity. Don't watch a YouTube video because it's there. Don't watch a YouTuber because they aren't doing anything wrong.
2783000	2797000	Watch videos on this website to be amazed, to be inspired. Watch YouTubers because they are great. And if none of your current favorite channels can give that to you, then unsubscribe from them, and don't come back until they're great again.
2797000	2810000	In the meantime, take some fucking initiative and go out and search for greatness. There are amazing, awe-inspiring, unbelievable talents scattered all across this website. It's just a matter of finding them.
2811000	2819000	It's all funny, you see, because I started off this video talking about YouTube poops and how people have all but ignored them over the years, and it's ironic.
2819000	2834000	Because the thing that makes YouTube poops great? The completely carefree experience of making a video just to make something creative, original, and meaningful to yourself without having to worry about views or the algorithm or ad revenue.
2834000	2845000	Just making videos, I don't know, for fun because you feel like it? The thing that makes YouTube poop great is the same thing that made YouTube great back in the day.
2845000	2855000	And just like YouTube poop, this idea of making videos for fun and not for business has been buried, overlooked, ignored, and nearly forgotten.
2855000	2862000	And yet, in spite of all that, in spite of YouTube and in spite of itself, YTP persists.
2862000	2868000	And as far as I'm concerned, as long as YouTube poop is alive, then so is the potential for greatness on YouTube.
2868000	2875000	So if you're just starting out making videos and everyone's telling you to do things one way, do the opposite. Do something completely off the wall.
2875000	2885000	Do something that's never been done by anyone before. Don't sell out your unique beliefs, opinions, and style just to make a couple extra cents of ad revenue.
2885000	2897000	Be the reason why people come to your channel. You get to decide what videos you make. Not the algorithm, not your fickle viewers, not giant corporate advertisers, not incompetent YouTube management.
2897000	2907000	At the end of the day, you are the one who has the power to conduct your channel. Never forget that and never let anyone or anything take that away from you.
2907000	2918000	Because as far as we try to stray from it, the ultimate goal of making YouTube videos is to broadcast yourself. So go out and be the best.
