1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Viewer discretion is advised.

2
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Because YouTube audiences generally love to hate on stuff.

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,000
As a matter of fact, I'm going to predict that this video is going to get a shitload of views

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
because I'm being critical of another YouTuber.

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
This is a good video. It's called Enough is Enough. It's about meme theory.

6
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
My homie, Emp Lemon's meme theory videos.

7
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000
But there's a little news from the Memeverse.

8
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Emperor Lemon made a funny video about why behind the meme is not that good of a YouTube page.

9
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Emperor Lemon downward spiral.

10
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Downward spiral.

11
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Downward spiral.

12
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Do I have everybody's attention now?

13
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:54,000
So, a couple months ago I uploaded this video and so far it has, without a doubt, become the most interesting video on my channel because of how people reacted.

14
00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Within two weeks, this video simultaneously became my most liked and most hated video.

15
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:07,000
I mean, I've always had a divided audience on basically everything I've uploaded since 2014, but never to this extent.

16
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Back in the day, everyone arguing in my comment sections were doing so within the realm of my own little bubble of content.

17
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:18,000
But with this video, I seem to have punched into a new level of YouTube.

18
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:27,000
And out of this new audience, I gained a lot of respect and admiration from my peers and I experienced the fastest subscriber growth rate in seven years of this channel.

19
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:31,000
However, I also became vociferously hated by a large chunk of people.

20
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:36,000
This video really stirred the pot for some people. I mean, a lot of people were pissed off.

21
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:42,000
I received criticism about basically every aspect of the video, but one of the biggest talking points was,

22
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Why, Amp? Why would you make a 30 plus minute video about behind the meme? What exactly was your goal here?

23
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:56,000
The guy's just making videos about memes. He's not actually hurting anyone. They're not doing anything wrong.

24
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Why do you care about this stupid, innocuous thing so much? Well, let me tell you.

25
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:09,000
I'm originally a YouTube pooper and I've been making YouTube poops for seven years now. Still do, actually.

26
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Now, depending on the person I tell that to, they're either impressed or confused. Why impressed?

27
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Because YouTube poops take a lot of creativity and patience, which causes most poopers to quit long before the time I've lasted.

28
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Why confused? Because so many people are under the impression that YouTube poops are still the same as they were back in 2009.

29
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:34,000
And they wonder, how can someone make videos about Weegee toast pingas dinner for seven years?

30
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:40,000
It's a misconception that really grinds my gears because it stems from a thought process of pure ignorance.

31
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:47,000
It's a refusal to accept that YTPs are diverse as well as a refusal to accept that YTPs change over time.

32
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:53,000
You know, like every single other contemporary art movement, but nobody views YTPs as such.

33
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:56,000
They just aren't respected because they have poop in the title.

34
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:00,000
People will just watch Sky had a Weegee and assume that all poops are like that.

35
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:07,000
And even the few brave souls who venture beyond that still refuse to try anything new or slightly out of their comfort zone.

36
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:14,000
They yearn for the older days of Durham Rocker or Orpheus, and bemoan how all modern YTPs suck,

37
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:20,000
despite the fact that if you actually open your fucking eyes, poops nowadays are better than they have ever been,

38
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:29,000
and they beat the YTP is dead drum, all while failing to realize that YouTube Poop's ability to consistently renew its approaches

39
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:36,000
and methodologies is what makes it great, and what prevents it from becoming yet another stale, overblown fad.

40
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Remember montage parodies? They all stayed the same as the day they first got popular.

41
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:45,000
They never ventured from the same memes and same style of humor.

42
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:51,000
They stayed in all your favorite little cozy comfort zones of what you self-professed internet critics find humorous.

43
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:57,000
And guess what? No one makes montage parodies anymore, but people still make YouTube Poops.

44
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:02,000
I don't understand why they try, considering they're just gonna get ass-blasted with derision,

45
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:08,000
reminding them how they'll never be as good as some guy from 2011 who hasn't made a video in half a decade,

46
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:16,000
or have their entire efforts dismissed by nonchalant viewer number 9000 who thinks it's just gonna be 10 minutes of spaghetti toast dinner theater,

47
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:22,000
and they have to tolerate all of this, while videos with a single fucking edit get 10,000 times more views and praise.

48
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Honestly, I don't know why the fuck I got popular making YouTube Poops after 2009.

49
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Everywhere I look, I'm reminded that I didn't get popular because of YouTube Poop, but in spite of YouTube Poop.

50
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:41,000
And I have tried for years to spread the modicum of popularity I had with other poopers who really deserved it, but didn't get as lucky as I did.

51
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:48,000
And nobody fucking cared. I couldn't even get my audience, people who watch YouTube Poops, to watch other people's YTPs.

52
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:53,000
People are just so fucking set in their ways that they aren't willing to give these videos a chance.

53
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:57,000
So I'd given up, which is why there wasn't a top YTPs list for 2016.

54
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:00,000
But then, along the way, I caught a tiny glimmer of hope.

55
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:05,000
I saw that this guy called BehindTheMeme made a video explaining YouTube Poops.

56
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:11,000
This guy with a built-in audience of hundreds of thousands of eager fans is finally gonna set the record straight.

57
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Finally, after all these years, the misconceptions and ignorance surrounding YouTube Poop is finally gonna get put to rest.

58
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:27,000
And then I watched the video, and it wasn't good. It wasn't even okay. It was bad. It was fucking bad.

59
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Every misconception that people had about YouTube Poops had not been refuted, but reinforced.

60
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:38,000
BehindTheMeme had the power to do something really good here, to rejuvenate a fledgling art form.

61
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:45,000
But he didn't do that. He did the opposite. He put forward a low-effort, robotic, poorly-researched farce of a video.

62
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Thanks for watching, and thanks for the ad revenue. Now on to the next meme.

63
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:55,000
And that was my main point of the BehindTheMeme video. His content fucking sucks.

64
00:05:55,000 --> 00:06:01,000
BehindTheMeme makes bad content, yet everyone seems to be okay with it.

65
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:07,000
My point with this video was not that normies shouldn't use memes, the only thing everyone seems to be talking about.

66
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:20,000
My point was that BehindTheMeme was doing a shitty job at explaining them, causing his generally normie audience to have a poor understanding, and thus ruin the memes through misuse and haphazard spam.

67
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,000
And so many people just rushed to defend BehindTheMeme.

68
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:26,000
All he's doing is explaining the history of memes.

69
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Since when did just doing something become passable for you people? He's doing a bad job.

70
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:41,000
BehindTheMeme's content is bad. It's just bad. It's lazy, repetitive, uninspired crap that anyone could make.

71
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:46,000
There's not much separating it from a text-to-speech bot reading off of Know Your Meme articles.

72
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:36,000
It just baffles me how many people see nothing wrong with this guy's content.

73
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Has YouTube really gotten so shitty that now it's okay to be mediocre?

74
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:44,000
And that's when it hit me. It has. It fucking has.

75
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:51,000
YouTube content in general has become so bad that people are willing to believe that BehindTheMeme makes good videos.

76
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:58,000
When I first discovered YouTube as a kid, I watched stuff like Charlie the Unicorn, PlayWorld, and The Laser Collection.

77
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,000
What the fuck do kids today have to watch on YouTube?

78
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Spider-Man, Elsa, softcore pornography?

79
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Now granted, the stuff I watched didn't exactly have the cinematic merit of Citizen Kane,

80
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:12,000
but they were original, creatively driven, artistic projects.

81
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:18,000
They weren't something engineered to suck as much watch time out of young children as physically possible.

82
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Seriously though, what the fuck happened to content on this website?

83
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Now obviously, there's still good content.

84
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
If content ain't good, I ain't watching it.

85
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,000
And I still watch a lot of content these days.

86
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:34,000
YouTube will always have inspired, creative, passionate individuals making content.

87
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
It's just a matter of finding them.

88
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:42,000
I'm able to find them through finely tuned subscriptions and recommendations based off of seven years of search history.

89
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:45,000
But what about the people who are just starting to watch stuff on this website?

90
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:50,000
I think it's fair to say that YouTube is populated primarily by young teens and children.

91
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:54,000
It's hard to tell for sure because everyone just lies about their age anyway.

92
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:59,000
But if I had to guess, I would estimate that the median age of people on this website is around 15 years old.

93
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:05,000
That means that the majority of YouTube content consumers today probably weren't around to see content from before 2012.

94
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
They don't remember the old days.

95
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:11,000
Believe it or not, you guys, this website used to be fucking great.

96
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:21,000
By far the most compelling component to the allure of early YouTube

97
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:26,000
was the idea that average, regular people could become popular from seemingly out of nowhere.

98
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Take Fred for example, YouTube's first real big star.

99
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:32,000
He was just some guy making videos in his backyard.

100
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:36,000
Then three years later he was starring in his own TV movie with John Cena.

101
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:42,000
What we had here was this brand new platform where anyone with a webcam and Windows movie maker

102
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:47,000
could broadcast themselves to potentially millions of people from around the world.

103
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:52,000
The people that first got popular on YouTube were just amateur videographers, animators, and editors.

104
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:57,000
They weren't A-list movie stars, they didn't have thousands of dollars worth of filmmaking equipment,

105
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:01,000
and they didn't have decades of professional experience in producing media.

106
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:05,000
They were just regular people that you could walk past on the street without noticing.

107
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:11,000
Becoming popular on YouTube or having a video go viral was not just a far-fetched dream, but a tangible goal.

108
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
Which brings me to my next point.

109
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:26,000
In the days of classic YouTube, the only thing separating you from popularity was your own talent, creativity, intellect, and passion.

110
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:33,000
If you were willing to sit down, buckle your fuckle, and put in the effort to make your content as entertaining as it could be,

111
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:36,000
then you would get subscribers and views.

112
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:41,000
Because generally on YouTube at this time, good content and talented people could rise to the top.

113
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:49,000
Sure, it wouldn't be immediate, but there was a strong sense back then where if you put in the dedication to keep making good content,

114
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
you would eventually be validated for it.

115
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:56,000
If you worked hard enough and your videos were entertaining, you could make it to the top all by yourself.

116
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:02,000
It was an environment in which real talent, effort, and quality was rewarded with success.

117
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:07,000
It used to be really easy to discover new content on YouTube.

118
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:15,000
You used to be able to see whenever one of your subscriptions liked a video or rated a video five stars depending on how old we're talking about.

119
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:22,000
If you found just one YouTuber whose content you liked, this feature made it easy to branch out and find similar artists.

120
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:29,000
You could then look out for what those YouTubers liked and so on and so on until you had a network of new people to watch.

121
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:36,000
This system allowed small channels to gain much more traction early on since they would gain exposure every time a big YouTuber liked one of their videos.

122
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:40,000
People were also more likely to search for new videos back then.

123
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:44,000
In those days, YouTubers didn't upload as much and videos were shorter.

124
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:49,000
This encouraged viewers to go out and search for new content if they wanted to stay entertained.

125
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:56,000
Part of the actual entertainment of the site was trekking through chains of bizarre videos and poking your head in the weird part of YouTube.

126
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:01,000
So not only did the mechanics of YouTube allow viewers to discover new videos,

127
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:07,000
more videos were discovered because YouTube conditioned viewers to go out and explore new content.

128
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:17,000
It is impossible to describe the greatness of old YouTube without highlighting the wealth of quality, independent animation on the website.

129
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:24,000
YouTube provided a new generation of amateur animators, a platform on which millions of people could view their artwork.

130
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:33,000
Animators like Oni, Harry Partridge, and Egoraptor started off on sites like Newgrounds, however reached unprecedented heights through the wider appeal of YouTube.

131
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:39,000
Animation on YouTube really served as the site's heart and soul for creatively driven artistic content.

132
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:45,000
YouTube animations as opposed to cartoons on television were wild, radical, and unrestrained.

133
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:53,000
While most of them weren't necessarily high quality from an animation perspective, they were under the full creative discretion of the animator.

134
00:12:53,000 --> 00:13:00,000
Often times the same individual would write, voice, and animate their projects, leaving them complete creative control.

135
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:06,000
This made YouTube animation unique as it allowed the full artistic intent of the creator to roam freely.

136
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:16,000
One aspect that often gets overlooked about early YouTube is how content creators back then were much more honest and down to earth.

137
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:22,000
YouTubers were much more straightforward back in the day because there wasn't as much of an incentive to run your channel like a business.

138
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:31,000
Before 2010, YouTube as a whole didn't draw that much ad revenue, so the YouTube Partner Program was much more exclusive, only granted to the highest viewed channels.

139
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:38,000
So for the vast majority of content producers, they just made content with the intention of making good, memorable videos.

140
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:45,000
Going back to the independent YouTube animators, you could tell that the jokes and comedy in their videos reflected their actual senses of humor.

141
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:49,000
YouTubers back then just kind of did stuff that they wanted to do.

142
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:54,000
They were interested and invested in their own content, which made the content better overall.

143
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:58,000
They weren't afraid of projecting their own opinions and personality into their work.

144
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:09,000
This made YouTubers much more personal, connected, and empathetic than conventional celebrities because the videos and person behind the videos often operated on the same ideological engine.

145
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:14,000
Creators didn't seek out audiences as much, rather audiences sought out YouTubers.

146
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:22,000
This allowed YouTubers from the old days to present their content genuinely and honestly without fear of being tossed aside for speaking their minds.

147
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:31,000
It's interesting to consider that early YouTube was an unprecedented new paradigm of entertainment.

148
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:37,000
I say unprecedented because back in the day, nobody really knew what could and couldn't get popular on YouTube.

149
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:41,000
There wasn't a set-in-stone formula for how to maximize your clicks.

150
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:46,000
Everyone just kind of had to do trial and error, throw whatever shit they could at the wall and see what stuck.

151
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:51,000
This experimentation led to some of the most original and creative videos this site has ever seen.

152
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:56,000
Now of course, this also led to a lot of shitty, terrible, god-awful videos, but that was part of the fun.

153
00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:02,000
YouTube was a mixed bag, and it ultimately made browsing videos an inherently interesting experience.

154
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:05,000
Videos back then were much more spontaneous and unexpected.

155
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:09,000
Sure, most of them weren't good, but it kept you on your toes.

156
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:17,000
The content was diverse, and there was a constant pressure for YouTubers to think outside the box and renew their techniques rather than becoming complacent and stale.

157
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:29,000
Speaking from a personal perspective, the main reason I started using YouTube for the majority of my entertainment consumption was because it was simply better than television.

158
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:35,000
I started watching YouTube videos in 2006, and I became a frequent visitor on YouTube by 2009.

159
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:41,000
Ever since then, I've watched videos on YouTube for basically every single day, 365 days a year.

160
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,000
I used to do the same thing with television.

161
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:46,000
My favorite channels growing up were Nickelodeon and Cartoon Network.

162
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:56,000
And it just so happened that around 2009, when I transitioned primarily to watching YouTube, both Nickelodeon and Cartoon Network were churning out some pretty mediocre shows.

163
00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:04,000
So I thought, why would I wait for these television networks to deliver me content I want to see when I can just go out and find it on YouTube?

164
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:07,000
YouTube was just so much of an improvement over television back then.

165
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:17,000
Instead of having to watch what was available, basic programming for general audiences, I could seek out whatever content that appealed to my specific entertainment tastes.

166
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:22,000
And to make things better, the content on YouTube was made by regular people like me.

167
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:30,000
And that depth of connection allowed me to enjoy the content to a special extent that was never possible through television or cinema.

168
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:36,000
And those, ladies and gentlemen, were the seven reasons why YouTube used to be fucking great.

169
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:47,000
Now I want you to take a good long look at those seven things while I carefully explain to you how, in less than a decade, YouTube has managed to completely fuck up every single one of them.

170
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:51,000
Because YouTube has been on a downward spiral.

171
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:08,000
Downward spiral.

172
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:19,000
So if you want to make it big on YouTube these days, well you better get used to those fucking rags. It's not happening.

173
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:22,000
Remember when I said that becoming popular on YouTube was a tangible goal?

174
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:32,000
Well buddy, if you want to get popular on YouTube these days from scratch, then you're probably better off auditioning for Hollywood or playing the lottery than trying to make it on the site in 2017.

175
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:46,000
Because in order to compete with all the vapid shit the site pumps out on a daily basis, you better be prepared to bust your ass working around the clock for basically non-existent wages on videos that will probably be overshadowed by some guy more popular than you.

176
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:53,000
Every idea that you could possibly think of has already been done a thousand-fold by some guys more popular than you.

177
00:17:53,000 --> 00:18:02,000
And even if you manage to think of an idea or series that is completely new and original, some guy more popular than you will steal that idea and take all the glory.

178
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:07,000
YouTube has stagnated into a power class system similar to that of Victorian England.

179
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:16,000
Upward mobility is practically impossible. You either have to be a pre-established celebrity or suck a popular YouTuber's cock if you want any hope of working your way up the ranks.

180
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:27,000
Of course, you could always sell out and attempt to ride some popular trend to the top. Enjoy your two-month spike of popularity until you get labeled a one-trick pony and fail to develop any personal impression on your audience.

181
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:31,000
You are now free to ride the stale expressing obscurity.

182
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:44,000
But let's say you're more than just a regular Joe. You're exceptional at something. You have the talent and drive and vision to be better at your thing than almost anyone else in the world.

183
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:55,000
I mean, surely if you're that talented, you can make it big on YouTube, right? Well, you better also be super talented at writing, video production, and editing, or else no one will even take you seriously.

184
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:58,000
Of course, you could just hire somebody to do those things for you.

185
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:02,000
Did I mention that YouTube pays basically nothing unless you're a massive channel?

186
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:11,000
But say you have all of those things. You're talented, charismatic, a good writer, good on camera, and you're capable of editing a video into a polished final product.

187
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:18,000
Congratulations! You've finally unlocked the potential for people to watch you perform your talent, whatever that is.

188
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:23,000
Now just keep pouring your time and effort into producing content for, oh, a couple of years.

189
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:31,000
By this time, some schmuck on Reddit or Tumblr will have noticed one of your videos and shared it in order to farm some free internet points off of your hard work.

190
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:40,000
But hey, your stuff will finally be seen by a bunch of people. Congratulations, you've finally achieved a modicum of success on YouTube.

191
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:49,000
Now comes the best part, as you watch helplessly while the one single popular thing you made gets plundered by talentless reaction channels and compilation channels.

192
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:54,000
All of whom get more views and subscribers than you could possibly ever hope to attain.

193
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:58,000
And hey, some of them might even give you credit for your own work.

194
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:04,000
Because these days, YouTube audiences are too stupid and lazy to care about who makes the content they watch.

195
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:10,000
They just want to be doped up on a constant stream of bright, colorful content, no questions asked.

196
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:18,000
I wish it wasn't so, but how else could your original videos get fewer views than a video of a guy recording himself watching your videos?

197
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:26,000
It may not seem fair, but quit your crying. The reaction and compilation channels are just doing a better job at satisfying the algorithm.

198
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:30,000
Oh yeah, did I mention the ALGORITHM?

199
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:38,000
So remember when people on YouTube actually had to go out and explore the content they wanted to watch?

200
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:45,000
Well, not anymore. Now you can just sit back and relax while the ALGORITHM delivers you all the content you should be watching.

201
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:54,000
No user input required. Just click on your homepage and YouTube will recommend you all the videos that they know you'll like watching.

202
00:20:54,000 --> 00:21:03,000
Oh, what's that? You want to watch your subscriptions? You know, the channels that you already like for sure to the extent that you want to be notified of their future uploads?

203
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:07,000
Well, fuck you! You don't know what you like! But the ALGORITHM does!

204
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:11,000
So we're setting your homepage to default. Fuck subscriptions!

205
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:17,000
It's also good to know that YouTube has removed the ability to see videos that your favorite YouTubers liked and shared,

206
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:22,000
and they even removed the little drop-down tab that showed the video uploader's other videos.

207
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:28,000
Now if you find a channel that you like, you have to click on their channel icon, and then click on the videos tab if you want to see their videos.

208
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:36,000
It's like two extra clicks, but I'm sure the lazy, inattentive, modern-day YouTube audience would be happy to comply with those additional steps.

209
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:41,000
Because the more steps separating you from the content you want to see, the merrier.

210
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:48,000
But hey, at least YouTube added a default auto-play feature so that the ALGORITHM can feed you a video in zero clicks!

211
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:57,000
No need to explore new channels! Why go out and search for small, up-and-coming channels when the ALGORITHM can feed you videos from YouTubers who are already rich and successful?

212
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:03,000
But YouTube really does care about its small channels having their videos discovered, which is why they added the TRENDING tab!

213
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:06,000
Oh wait, the TRENDING tab doesn't actually feature trending videos?

214
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:11,000
Oh wait, the TRENDING tab is composed of videos completely cherry-picked by YouTube?

215
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,000
Well, are they at least helping out small YouTubers?

216
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:22,000
Oh wait, the TRENDING tab only features the same 100 or so popular YouTube channels as well as celebrities, pop stars, and TV shows that are already famous!

217
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:52,000
Well, sorry, small channels. At least you still have the trusty method of graffiti-ing your channel name on the inside of bathroom stalls.

218
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:57,000
Oh, you idiot! What the fuck?

219
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:02,000
Man, isn't the ALGORITHM great?

220
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:14,000
Turns out the algorithm wasn't so great for pretty much every single independent animator on YouTube.

221
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:19,000
Here's a little YouTube history lesson for you guys. The algorithm we have today wasn't the original one.

222
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:24,000
YouTube's first algorithm recommended videos based on view count and video tags.

223
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:29,000
You know, those keywords you stick to a video when you upload it? Yeah, those actually used to mean something.

224
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:35,000
Sure, the old algorithm wasn't perfect, but it generally allowed better videos to get more views.

225
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:43,000
And by using tags to sort recommended videos, the old algorithm made it easier to chain videos together about similar topics.

226
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:53,000
Nowadays, videos are sorted as broadly as the fucking category, which is why you still get recommended pyrocynical videos even though you've done nothing but watch TF2 videos for three days.

227
00:23:53,000 --> 00:24:03,000
Yeah, to no surprise, people abuse the fuck out of the system when they can. Which is pretty ironic, considering that's the reason YouTube changed the original algorithm to what we have now.

228
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:07,000
Apparently people were just spamming their videos with a wide range of tags.

229
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:14,000
And I think it also had something to do with some girls with boobs who made some reaction videos or something?

230
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:20,000
But anyway, YouTube changed the algorithm so that video success would be based on watch time and not view count.

231
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:27,000
Wow, it sure is nice to see that changing the algorithm got rid of clickbaity reaction videos.

232
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:34,000
But a consequence of the algorithm change that actually affected people was the extinction of animation on YouTube.

233
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:41,000
Animation is a long, time-consuming process that results in a high-quality product with high rewatchability.

234
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:49,000
Prior to the algorithm change, YouTube animators relied on their videos receiving a high volume of views to offset the infrequency of their uploads.

235
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:56,000
Since most animations are short, the algorithm change made it so that animations would only receive a fraction of the views that they did before.

236
00:24:56,000 --> 00:25:01,000
So through one simple change in a line of code, YouTube made animation completely unprofitable.

237
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:04,000
But hey, at least we got Let's Plays!

238
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:10,000
Now don't get me wrong, I think Game Grumps is an okay channel. For what they do, it's adequate content.

239
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:14,000
But what a lot of people forget is that Egoraptor made great animations.

240
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:22,000
Was it really worth it to give up an excellent animation every few weeks in order to watch Aaron play video games for a half an hour every single day?

241
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:26,000
Sure, it was amusing at first, but don't people get tired of this stuff?

242
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:29,000
And they did, because I don't care how good your content is.

243
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:34,000
Regular people aren't physically able to sit through half an hour of it every single goddamn day.

244
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:37,000
There's just too much content to go around.

245
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:44,000
If you're subscribed to like five Let's Play channels, that's like between two to four hours of content every single day depending on who you sub to.

246
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:48,000
Fuck that shit, just give me the fifteen minutes of great animation a week.

247
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:53,000
By changing the algorithm, YouTube encouraged a system that favored quantity over quality.

248
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:57,000
And this was the beginning of the downfall for this fucking website.

249
00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:09,000
Remember how I said that YouTube used to be populated with genuine personalities who cared about the quality of their content?

250
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:10,000
Well, not anymore!

251
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:15,000
Quality on YouTube in 2017? Quality doesn't matter anymore.

252
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:18,000
Being genuine and honest doesn't matter anymore.

253
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:24,000
The only thing that matters now on this website is the number of ads that you can cram into your viewers' brains.

254
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:31,000
Now, I understand that YouTube is ultimately a business, and I have nothing wrong with people building their wealth by making YouTube videos.

255
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:33,000
In fact, I encourage it.

256
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:41,000
But when everyone starts strictly operating their YouTube channels like a business, there are core elements of this website that become lost.

257
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:46,000
Nearly all videos these days just seem so detached and disingenuous.

258
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:52,000
It seems like almost everyone has to dumb down their content in order to cater to more general audiences.

259
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:55,000
YouTubers are just so fake these days, it's almost sickening.

260
00:26:55,000 --> 00:27:00,000
It's like living in a city populated entirely by lawyers, politicians, and car salesmen.

261
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:03,000
Everywhere you go on this website, someone's trying to sell you something.

262
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:10,000
If they're not trying to sell you razors, ebooks, or monthly crates, they're hell-bent on trying to sell you a subscription to their channel.

263
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:11,000
Hey, can you subscribe?

264
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:16,000
Make sure to subscribe, and like, and share, and subscribe, and subscribe!

265
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,000
Please fucking subscribe!

266
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:30,000
I swear to fucking Christ, if one more fucking YouTuber tells me to subscribe to them, I'm going to descend to a never-before-seen depth of my own personal downward mental spiral.

267
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:33,000
Seriously, people, enough is enough!

268
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:35,000
Enough is fucking enough!

269
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:46,000
Do you really think that people don't know how to press the fucking subscribe button to the extent that you have to remind them at the end of every fucking video?

270
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,000
And every YouTuber does this now.

271
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:49,000
Why?

272
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:52,000
If people like you, they'll subscribe.

273
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:56,000
You don't have to remind them every single chance you get.

274
00:27:56,000 --> 00:28:01,000
Has there ever been a single instance where someone has been watching a video and they're like,

275
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:08,000
Gee, I really like this YouTuber, but if only there was an easier way to find out whenever they upload new videos.

276
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:10,000
Just subscribe, boss. Just subscribe, boss.

277
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:11,000
Make sure you subscribe.

278
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:13,000
If you are not subscribed, guys, press that subscribe button.

279
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:15,000
If you are not around here, subscribe!

280
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:19,000
Oh yeah, I can subscribe.

281
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:21,000
Thanks for reminding me.

282
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:25,000
When has that sequence of events ever transpired in the history of this website?

283
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:33,000
This site is like over a billion active users, and I can't fathom that mental conversation ever taking place.

284
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:40,000
And fine, let's just imagine that you're a dumb enough fuck not to know the function of the subscribe button.

285
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:48,000
Well, in that case, I wouldn't want you subscribed to me anyway, because you'd be too much of an adult to understand my content in the first place.

286
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:52,000
Why the fuck do YouTubers have to constantly coax people to subscribe?

287
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:54,000
We should be asking people to unsubscribe.

288
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:57,000
That's what people actually need to be told to do.

289
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:59,000
Lord knows I try.

290
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:08,000
But no, YouTubers these days need to pander to, beg for, and cling on to every single last shred of a subscriber they can manage to scrounge up.

291
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:12,000
And God forbid you even think of speaking your mind on anything.

292
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:18,000
Everyone has to reduce their personalities to the equivalent of a stale piece of toast on top of a cardboard box.

293
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:21,000
YouTube today isn't about telling people what you want them to hear.

294
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:24,000
It's about telling them what they want you to say.

295
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:27,000
YouTube audiences don't want to be challenged anymore.

296
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:32,000
They just want to get doped up on some polished, sparkly, inoffensive content.

297
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:37,000
Why else would content like Buzzfeed, WatchMojo, and Fine Bros be so successful?

298
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:42,000
It just astounds me how the type of person who would go on Facebook and complain,

299
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:48,000
Oh my God, how can people watch the Kardashians? How can people listen to Katy Perry? How can people eat at McDonald's?

300
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,000
How can people have such bad taste?

301
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:54,000
And then they turn around and watch half an hour of Buzzfeed videos.

302
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:57,000
It's the same fucking shit. Do you people not realize that?

303
00:29:57,000 --> 00:30:00,000
Congratulations. You played yourself.

304
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:06,000
Can I ask something to you people out there who actually watch Buzzfeed or Fine Bros or WatchMojo and enjoy the content?

305
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:12,000
How does it feel? How does it feel knowing you're consuming videos fabricated by some corporate suit in a boardroom

306
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:16,000
who specifically designs their content to appeal to saps like you?

307
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:22,000
And how does it feel to realize that you're such a predictable simpleton that it works and you eat that shit up?

308
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:25,000
So go ahead. Keep watching the Buzzfeeds of YouTube.

309
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:32,000
The faceless corporate entities who view you people as nothing more than walking dollar signs.

310
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:40,000
Keep pouring views and watch time into them rather than supporting independent, individually operated channels who actually care about their audiences.

311
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:43,000
Why do people nowadays strive to be like the next fucking Buzzfeed?

312
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:47,000
Why aren't there more people trying to be like the next Vsauce or the next video game Dunkey?

313
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:56,000
Oh wait, people try to do that only to get slaughtered in view count by the torrent of vapid and unstimulating dreck that this site turns out on a daily basis.

314
00:30:56,000 --> 00:31:02,000
God, it's absolutely disgusting the extent to which this website has lost its heart and soul.

315
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:05,000
But wait, I'm not done yet.

316
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:15,000
Every popular video on modern YouTube has to be cloned from the same couple of identical cookie cutter templates.

317
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:18,000
Here's how to open a popular YouTube channel in 2017.

318
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:26,000
First you gotta pay some guy to divvy you up a shiny, whooshy, whooshy, cool looking 3D intro in After Effects while you blast some obnoxious EDM bass drop.

319
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:31,000
Now you get to choose your YouTube skill tree.

320
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:36,000
You can either become a gaming channel, a commentary channel, or a list channel.

321
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:40,000
Gaming channel's easy. You just record yourself playing a game for a couple of hours.

322
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:46,000
They say it helps if you have charisma or dynamic speaking skills, but that's just a bunch of bullshit.

323
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:50,000
All you gotta do is scream really loudly and curse every 2.5 seconds.

324
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:53,000
Anything less frequent than that and the kiddies won't be entertained.

325
00:31:53,000 --> 00:32:02,000
Just kidding! You could have your goldfish commentate your let's play and 90% of YouTube viewers will still watch it because they'd rather watch someone play a game than play one themselves.

326
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:15,000
Now take that massive chunk of raw gaming footage you just recorded, chop it up into 10 minute intervals, slap on an intro and end screen to each part with minimal or non-existent editing, and congratulations!

327
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:19,000
You have now produced enough content for a month's worth of daily uploads.

328
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:21,000
So what if you want to do commentary videos?

329
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:29,000
Well, just repeat the same process of making a gaming video and just record yourself talking over it with a completely unrelated topic for 10 minutes.

330
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:37,000
It helps if you make a big giant stink over a topic that realistically doesn't matter because people really seem to care about that.

331
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:41,000
And make sure to set the category of the video to gaming because you're totally gaming, right?

332
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:43,000
Soon you'll be raking in those clicks.

333
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:50,000
Alternatively, you could just talk over a movie or TV show and talk about how much you vociferously HANED IT.

334
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:56,000
Man, isn't it amazing how skilled we as a society have become at tearing media to shreds?

335
00:32:56,000 --> 00:33:05,000
Gosh, I never knew how much every single movie, TV show, cartoon, video game, and song is the absolute scourge of humanity.

336
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:07,000
But YouTube content?

337
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:08,000
It's all good.

338
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:10,000
Nothing to criticize here.

339
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:15,000
Hey, as long as they're just doing their own thing, it must be great content.

340
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:17,000
Just ignore it, bro.

341
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:25,000
Meanwhile, let's go back to hating on this bad movie made by like one unknown guy on a shoestring budget who's probably shot himself by now.

342
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:28,000
They've gotta be held accountable for their crimes against humanity.

343
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:30,000
Priorities, guys!

344
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:32,000
Anyway, what the fuck else is there to do on this website?

345
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:34,000
Oh yeah, list videos.

346
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:38,000
Just arbitrarily rank and arrange random shit in a list.

347
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:40,000
Research and fact-checking is optional.

348
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:49,000
In fact, you probably shouldn't even attempt to do that stuff because it'll just slow you down from making a list video on every single possible permutation of ideas in existence.

349
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:52,000
So just hastily cobble together whatever dumb shit you can.

350
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:57,000
Pump out 200 lists a year and hope one of them gets arbitrarily picked up by the algorithm.

351
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:59,000
And make sure each video is ten minutes.

352
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:02,000
TEN MINUTES.

353
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:06,000
So that you can earn that extra AD revenue.

354
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:08,000
Because that's really what this is all about.

355
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:13,000
What, you think people make all these same videos over and over again because they're fun?

356
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:14,000
Fuck no!

357
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:18,000
YouTube stopped being about having fun a long time ago.

358
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:26,000
The reason these same videos are fucking everywhere is because you people pour watch time into them regardless of whether or not you're entertained.

359
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:28,000
You zombies validate this system.

360
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:36,000
And you make it so that these specific video templates are the only profitable means of video production because they're low-effort, high-volume videos.

361
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:42,000
And what we've done here is constrain the profitability of YouTube videos to these parameters.

362
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:43,000
But that's just the beginning.

363
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:50,000
Not only must videos be low-effort, mass-produced, frequently uploaded, and over ten minutes to succeed in 2017,

364
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:53,000
they can't be too long either or people will lose interest.

365
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:59,000
Because god forbid anyone in this generation has an attention span longer than that of a fucking goldfish,

366
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:04,000
the number of fuckers complaining that my Behind the Meme video was too long made me realize this.

367
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:14,000
Sure, the same pinheads who've gladly watched some dude play Minecraft for 24 minutes are unable to sit through 30 minutes of a structured and detailed argument with consistent visual editing.

368
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:17,000
But I guess that's my fault too, right?

369
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:19,000
YOU FUCKING BITCH!

370
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:21,000
Oh yeah, that's another thing.

371
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:25,000
YouTube viewers don't like to think, and YouTube viewers don't like to be challenged.

372
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:29,000
Make sure your videos are as dumbed down and simplistic as possible.

373
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:33,000
You should make your dialogue so basic that a third grader could understand it.

374
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:37,000
Because let's face it, they probably make up a majority of your viewers anyway.

375
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:42,000
So rather than encourage them to elevate themselves to a level worthy of intellectual discussion,

376
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:45,000
it's just easier to shut off about half of your brain cells because

377
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:48,000
GOD FORBID WE DON'T ACT INCLUSIVELY

378
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:51,000
towards every slack-jawed idiot with an internet connection.

379
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:57,000
We gotta sync to their level to make sure they're nice and comfy and don't have to use their brains.

380
00:35:57,000 --> 00:36:00,000
So yeah, don't make your content too advanced either.

381
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:04,000
And also make sure you only talk about innocuous and vapid topics in all your videos.

382
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:09,000
Because anything more extreme than that will be considered non-advertiser friendly.

383
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:17,000
That's right, YouTube themselves will financially sandbag your video if you dare to entertain any audience above the age of 9.

384
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:23,000
They saw a new generation of YouTubers like Filthy Frank and iDubbbz succeeding by making edgy, raunchy content

385
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:26,000
that appealed to an older, previously disenfranchised audience.

386
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:28,000
Well fuck them, right?

387
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:34,000
They saw a new paradigm of journalism forming with a rise of independently operated news channels

388
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:38,000
that could disseminate information free from the control of mainstream media.

389
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:40,000
Well fuck them too.

390
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:43,000
Some disgraced Wall Street Journal guy called PewDiePie and Nazi.

391
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:46,000
And now Coke and Pepsi will only run ads on toy reviews.

392
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:52,000
So fuck literally every single small YouTuber who had a dream of succeeding on this website through original content.

393
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:56,000
Hey, at least Coke, Pepsi, and YouTube kept their good PR.

394
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:58,000
Thanks for taking one for the team, guys.

395
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:01,000
Man, isn't economic censorship fun?

396
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:03,000
So let's review, shall we?

397
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:08,000
If you want to run a profitable channel on YouTube, your videos have to be limited to three different templates

398
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:15,000
of ten to fifteen minute, low effort, high volume content that's dumbed down, neutered, and pandering

399
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:18,000
towards the most generalized audience of simpletons.

400
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:23,000
So if you're wondering why all the videos on modern YouTube kind of feel the same, this is why.

401
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:28,000
Because YouTube has fabricated a system where only one type of video can succeed.

402
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:33,000
Wait a minute, high volume, dumbed down content pandering to general audiences?

403
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:36,000
Well that's just fucking television!

404
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:43,000
And that, ladies and gentlemen, is the raw, barebones, unadulterated truth.

405
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:48,000
Through all these changes that YouTube has gone through in the past five years, YouTube has lost its heart,

406
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:55,000
it's lost its soul, it's lost every aspect that made it a unique and distinct entertainment platform.

407
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:59,000
And now, YouTube has become nothing more than television.

408
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:01,000
Just television, but shittier.

409
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:06,000
Because at least everything on TV has high production value, YouTube ain't got that.

410
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:12,000
Unless you count obnoxious 3D EDM intros, and television only has a couple hundred channels,

411
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:17,000
so there's little overlapping content, and each TV channel is fairly distinct in its programming.

412
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:22,000
YouTube has a million channels, and the majority of them are making the same exact videos.

413
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:26,000
It's just amazing how much YouTube wants to be like television.

414
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:31,000
They ripped off YouTube Gaming from Twitch, they ripped off YouTube Red from Netflix,

415
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:34,000
they ripped off YouTube TV from fucking TV!

416
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:37,000
Why not understand Google's business strategy here?

417
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:42,000
Why not try to become distinct from your competitors, rather than making shittier versions of their products?

418
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:48,000
Need I remind them of Google Plus, their completely disastrous attempt to copy Facebook?

419
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:51,000
Thanks for trying to force it down our throats for two years, by the way.

420
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:54,000
Glad to see that it wasn't a complete waste of human resources.

421
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:57,000
But I guess YouTube is hell-bent on being television now,

422
00:38:57,000 --> 00:39:03,000
even though it can't possibly hope to compete with cable, or even Netflix in terms of quality.

423
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:09,000
TV and Netflix have programming made by professional writers and producers, the best in the world.

424
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:11,000
YouTube is just a bunch of amateurs!

425
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:18,000
Instead of highlighting the novelty quirks and creative freedom that come with independent amateur video makers, like they used to do,

426
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:25,000
YouTube has decided to bottleneck all of its individuality into a system which forces everyone to be the same,

427
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:28,000
and iron out all of their strongest traits.

428
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:35,000
I'm sorry, but a bunch of amateur YouTubers making television-like content will never, ever complete with television.

429
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:37,000
Not in a million years!

430
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:41,000
Television is backed by multi-billion dollar media corporations.

431
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:46,000
YouTube is backed by a couple of big soda companies trying to sell ads to kids.

432
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:48,000
You people saw what happened this year.

433
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:56,000
When a tiny minuscule fucking controversy happened, a couple of companies pulled their ads, and this website became absolutely anemic.

434
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:58,000
That shit doesn't happen with television.

435
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:02,000
People who work in television get paid and paid consistently.

436
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:07,000
As for YouTubers, it's becoming less and less of a reality every single day.

437
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:15,000
Content creators have absolutely zero control over how things are run on this website, and we always get the short end of the stick.

438
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:23,000
I've talked about all the shit that's wrong with YouTube so far, and I haven't even mentioned the site's complete failure to protect its creators from abusive copyright claims.

439
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:29,000
I haven't even mentioned the multiple pointless and confusing changes to the site's layout over the years.

440
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:40,000
I haven't even mentioned YouTube's complete lack of transparency, often making drastic changes with little to no community feedback, all while offering minuscule explanations about it all.

441
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:54,000
I haven't mentioned those times when YouTube inexplicably broke the comment section, or when they inexplicably broke subscriber counts, or when they inexplicably started unsubscribing fans from their favorite channels, ALLEGEDLY.

442
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:58,000
All of these topics have been covered already, in-depth, by other people.

443
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:15,000
But the overarching theme with all of these is that YouTube, despite being a giant multi-billion dollar social network, is run by incompetent boobs who make rash, impulsive decisions without any consultation or approval from its users.

444
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:21,000
And every time YouTube fucks up, the content creators are always the ones to have to pick up the slack.

445
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:25,000
Is it fair? No. Could things be any different? Also no.

446
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:33,000
As far as YouTube is concerned, their distinct objective is to deliver ads to eyeballs. Everything else is completely irrelevant to them.

447
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:41,000
They're certainly not going to piss off the advertisers, because they're the ones who pay the bills, and they're going to try to keep ad watchers pretty happy when they can.

448
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:52,000
So that just leaves content creators to get fucked, over, and over, and over, and over, and over, and over, and over, and over, and over, and over, and over, and over, and over, and over, and over, and over again.

449
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:57,000
Don't like it? Well, too bad. What you gonna do? Go to Vimeo? Please.

450
00:41:57,000 --> 00:42:02,000
If you actually want your stuff to be seen by more than a dozen people, it's YouTube or Bust.

451
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:09,000
And if you don't bend over and take your monthly YouTube-sanctioned buttfuck, then they'll find someone else who will.

452
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:14,000
People are lining up around the block to replace you and play by YouTube's rules.

453
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:21,000
YouTube has no reason to care about content creators, and if you're just sitting back, relaxing as a viewer, I've got news for you, buddy.

454
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:30,000
YouTube doesn't care about you either, because as soon as the content creators get fucked by YouTube's mistakes, it's the viewers who have to settle for shittier content.

455
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:35,000
At least when content is shitty on television, they can it and replace it with something people actually want to watch.

456
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:44,000
There's no getting rid of bad content on YouTube, because the fucking system that's currently in place encourages it, and viewers don't know where to turn to find anything better.

457
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:59,000
If this was TV, you just changed the channel. But on YouTube, when you try to change channels, you find the same dull, repetitive, uninspired, mass-produced, pandering, profiteering, manipulative garbage, and it's everywhere.

458
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:04,000
You can't escape from it. And the worst part is that there's absolutely nothing we can do about it.

459
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:11,000
The majority of people on the site have become so inundated by the sewage stream of content that they don't even question it.

460
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:20,000
They see channels like Behind the Meme, WatchMojo, BuzzFeed, and Finebros, and they believe that this is the way YouTube content is supposed to be.

461
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:25,000
Because they're not doing anything wrong, so how can they be bad?

462
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:39,000
The state of YouTube is bad, okay? YouTube is unwell right now, and from what I can see, it's headed in a direction that looks to be very detrimental for content creators, viewers, and YouTube itself.

463
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:48,000
Sure, the situation may not seem very dire right now, but if things stay the way they are for ten or even five years, then I just don't know what will happen.

464
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:54,000
But it won't be good. Things may already be starting to fall apart into an irredeemably bad situation.

465
00:43:54,000 --> 00:44:00,000
It's becoming more and more difficult for small channels to gain any sort of traction or growth based on hard work alone,

466
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:08,000
while channels at the top of this website get fed views and watch time and ad revenue without having to actively improve or innovate their approaches.

467
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:20,000
I feel like YouTube has developed a system that rewards quantity over quality, and YouTube videos in general are becoming too long while additionally lacking any informative substance.

468
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:29,000
This is causing viewers to watch fewer videos and therefore fewer YouTubers. There's simply too much video content to go around and not enough time.

469
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:39,000
Viewer people are willing to go out and search for new YouTubers because subscribing to the average Let's Play channel already provides them with five hours of video plus a podcast per week.

470
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:45,000
Viewers are getting burnt out trying to watch everything, and small YouTubers are getting burnt out trying to compete with bigger channels.

471
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:58,000
What we have here is a system that's not built to last. YouTube has always been on the edge of control as a viable source of revenue, but never have times been more uncertain as right now and headed into the future.

472
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:07,000
So to anyone out there listening to my words right now, consider this video a warning. I really care about this website and what it represents, or at least what it used to represent.

473
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:20,000
And I am deeply concerned about the future of content creation on YouTube. And if you're like me, and you also care about this website, and you see the problems I see, then you're probably asking right now, what can I do to fix this?

474
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:32,000
And the answer to that is absolutely nothing. Well, at least not by yourself. A useless buzzword hashtag slogan isn't going to fix this. A pointless change.org petition isn't going to fix this.

475
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:49,000
What we have here is a problem that's become so deeply ingrained within the modern culture of YouTube that it's going to take a heavily concerted macro scale effort by advertisers, viewers, creators, and YouTube itself to restore the site to its former glory.

476
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:59,000
And I just don't see it happening, because in all honesty, the vast majority of people don't care. The vast majority of people won't even care enough to watch this video a tenth of the way through.

477
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:10,000
And it's going to take a cataclysmic event to happen before all you fucking zombies even turn your heads. But if you're not a zombie, and you're listening to me right now, then I have a message for you.

478
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:23,000
My message to everyone listening to this right now is to stop tolerating mediocrity. Don't watch a YouTube video because it's there. Don't watch a YouTuber because they aren't doing anything wrong.

479
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:37,000
Watch videos on this website to be amazed, to be inspired. Watch YouTubers because they are great. And if none of your current favorite channels can give that to you, then unsubscribe from them, and don't come back until they're great again.

480
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:50,000
In the meantime, take some fucking initiative and go out and search for greatness. There are amazing, awe-inspiring, unbelievable talents scattered all across this website. It's just a matter of finding them.

481
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:59,000
It's all funny, you see, because I started off this video talking about YouTube poops and how people have all but ignored them over the years, and it's ironic.

482
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:14,000
Because the thing that makes YouTube poops great? The completely carefree experience of making a video just to make something creative, original, and meaningful to yourself without having to worry about views or the algorithm or ad revenue.

483
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:25,000
Just making videos, I don't know, for fun because you feel like it? The thing that makes YouTube poop great is the same thing that made YouTube great back in the day.

484
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:35,000
And just like YouTube poop, this idea of making videos for fun and not for business has been buried, overlooked, ignored, and nearly forgotten.

485
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:42,000
And yet, in spite of all that, in spite of YouTube and in spite of itself, YTP persists.

486
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:48,000
And as far as I'm concerned, as long as YouTube poop is alive, then so is the potential for greatness on YouTube.

487
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:55,000
So if you're just starting out making videos and everyone's telling you to do things one way, do the opposite. Do something completely off the wall.

488
00:47:55,000 --> 00:48:05,000
Do something that's never been done by anyone before. Don't sell out your unique beliefs, opinions, and style just to make a couple extra cents of ad revenue.

489
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:17,000
Be the reason why people come to your channel. You get to decide what videos you make. Not the algorithm, not your fickle viewers, not giant corporate advertisers, not incompetent YouTube management.

490
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:27,000
At the end of the day, you are the one who has the power to conduct your channel. Never forget that and never let anyone or anything take that away from you.

491
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:38,000
Because as far as we try to stray from it, the ultimate goal of making YouTube videos is to broadcast yourself. So go out and be the best.

492
00:48:57,000 --> 00:48:59,000
YouTube Poop
