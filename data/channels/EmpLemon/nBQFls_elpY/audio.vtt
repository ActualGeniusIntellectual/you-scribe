00:00.000 --> 00:22.680
In the waning hours of February 17th, 2019, a YouTuber under the alias of Matt's What

00:22.680 --> 00:27.180
It Is uploaded a video that would send shockwaves across the entire site.

00:27.180 --> 00:31.720
By morning, the video would reach the front page of Reddit, accumulating millions of views

00:31.720 --> 00:32.900
on YouTube.

00:32.900 --> 00:36.980
All of a sudden, waves of outrage inundate every corner of the web.

00:36.980 --> 00:41.800
YouTube now faces ferocious controversy over Matt's allegations that the platform is willfully

00:41.800 --> 00:44.720
harboring child predators.

00:44.720 --> 00:49.260
YouTube reacts swiftly by deactivating the comment sections of thousands of child-oriented

00:49.260 --> 00:50.480
channels.

00:50.480 --> 00:55.220
Their efforts to subdue the mounting outrage would prove futile, as the controversy was

00:55.220 --> 00:57.560
now spiraling out of control.

00:57.560 --> 01:03.020
Over the next five days, no fewer than 70 articles report on YouTube's child-endangerment

01:03.020 --> 01:04.020
problem.

01:04.020 --> 01:07.980
At around the same time, companies begin pulling their ads.

01:07.980 --> 01:14.160
McDonald's, Disney, Nestle, AT&T, Epic Games, some of YouTube's biggest corporate partners

01:14.160 --> 01:16.040
withdraw their funding.

01:16.040 --> 01:21.700
Ad rates falter site-wide, YouTubers scramble for answers, the whole platform is tumbling

01:21.700 --> 01:27.140
down a spiral of outraged parents, ravenous reporters, and terrified advertisers, all

01:27.140 --> 01:29.940
led by a single red-haired stranger.

01:29.940 --> 01:34.700
Then, just as quickly as he appeared, he vanished, never to return.

01:34.700 --> 01:56.220
Now, more than a year afterwards, we are only just beginning to pick up the pieces.

01:56.220 --> 02:01.460
First we have to talk about the man behind the mayhem, Matt Watson, a common, ordinary

02:01.460 --> 02:03.900
name for a common, ordinary man.

02:03.900 --> 02:08.020
You see, the best thing about being ordinary is that it's really easy to blend in with

02:08.020 --> 02:09.580
the rest of the crowd.

02:09.580 --> 02:14.360
And in the YouTube community, nobody had any idea who Matt Watson was.

02:14.360 --> 02:18.900
No one had any contact with him on Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, Discord.

02:18.900 --> 02:21.420
The guy was a total outsider.

02:21.420 --> 02:25.920
Simple online searches for the stranger revealed a few other past social media accounts with

02:25.920 --> 02:27.600
limited information.

02:27.600 --> 02:32.020
The most substantial discovery would be his former YouTube channel, a channel that housed

02:32.020 --> 02:34.580
some rather strange videos.

02:34.580 --> 02:40.060
But all things considered, Matt's old videos only raised more questions than they answered.

02:40.060 --> 02:44.860
Ultimately, they provided no further details about his identity, occupation, or greater

02:44.860 --> 02:46.680
purpose on the platform.

02:46.680 --> 02:51.380
When the time came, he stormed into YouTube as an army of one, but prepared to recruit

02:51.380 --> 03:00.540
many others to his cause.

03:00.540 --> 03:06.460
And wake up, the brick in the window that started the riot, ground zero of YouTube's

03:06.460 --> 03:11.420
worst meltdown yet, a video that left many of its viewers red in the face and ready to

03:11.420 --> 03:17.140
burn the site to the ground.

03:17.140 --> 03:22.100
But amidst the anger, chaos, and disgust, many lost sight of whether the video was actually

03:22.100 --> 03:23.100
accurate.

03:23.100 --> 03:26.020
At a glance, Matt's efforts seemed noble enough.

03:26.020 --> 03:30.720
Child predation is a universally scorned activity, and Matt was doing his civic duty

03:30.720 --> 03:34.460
by alerting the greater public of a rather egregious example.

03:34.460 --> 03:39.540
The issues of Matt's video and his subsequent livestreams stem from his odd mischaracterizations

03:39.540 --> 03:42.820
of YouTube and the YouTube community as a whole.

03:42.820 --> 03:46.780
Several of the implications in the video range from deceptive to outright lies about the

03:46.780 --> 03:48.860
platform and its creators.

03:48.860 --> 03:53.220
To the average layman, the video may have seemed perfectly fine, but to seasoned YouTube

03:53.220 --> 03:56.940
veterans, these issues became a lot more apparent.

03:56.940 --> 04:01.660
First and foremost, the video is predicated entirely on the point that YouTube is facilitating

04:01.660 --> 04:06.700
a rabbit hole of content that connects bad actors with unsuspecting children and each

04:06.700 --> 04:19.940
other.

04:19.940 --> 04:24.140
The way Matt presents this, the audience is left to assume that YouTube is either grossly

04:24.140 --> 04:29.740
negligent, or worse, intentionally aiding child exploitation on the platform.

04:29.740 --> 04:33.580
And while YouTubers certainly know saints in this regard, specifically highlighting

04:33.580 --> 04:38.540
these videos and comments as a wormhole of scum and villainy is deceptive because it

04:38.540 --> 04:43.260
overlooks the fundamental directive of the general video recommendation algorithm on

04:43.260 --> 04:44.260
YouTube.

04:44.260 --> 04:48.260
Once you enter into this wormhole for whatever reason, YouTube's algorithm is glitching

04:48.260 --> 04:52.740
out to a point that nothing but these videos exist.

04:52.740 --> 04:58.160
If you look up any category of video on YouTube, the algorithm will recommend you more videos

04:58.160 --> 04:59.380
like it.

04:59.380 --> 05:07.300
This applies to cartoons, basketball, mukbang, ASMR, wasp removal videos, anything you enjoy

05:07.300 --> 05:08.300
watching.

05:08.300 --> 05:12.980
It's the algorithm's job to indiscriminately serve you more videos that will keep you on

05:12.980 --> 05:13.980
the site.

05:13.980 --> 05:16.300
The key word being indiscriminate.

05:16.340 --> 05:18.860
The algorithm doesn't know morality.

05:18.860 --> 05:23.160
Its job is not to tell you if what you're watching is ethically wrong.

05:23.160 --> 05:28.340
Its only purpose is to deduce what you like watching and give you more of it.

05:28.340 --> 05:32.260
The problem with Matt's video is that he presents an incredibly myopic view of the

05:32.260 --> 05:44.220
algorithm by highlighting only its capacity for abuse by bad actors.

05:44.220 --> 05:50.340
A deeper dive into YouTube will reveal a variety of dark, disturbing, and macabre wormholes.

05:50.340 --> 05:55.020
YouTube is not facilitating the abuse of baby monkeys for example.

05:55.020 --> 06:00.140
These wormholes only exist because of the strange users who inhabit them.

06:00.140 --> 06:04.660
It is the people who abuse this framework that create the wormhole.

06:04.660 --> 06:09.400
YouTube only provides the framework and expecting them to manually patrol the activities of

06:09.400 --> 06:12.940
billions of independent users is simply impossible.

06:12.940 --> 06:15.660
But therein lies the issue with Matt's video.

06:15.660 --> 06:20.060
Matt portrays the wormhole as if it's YouTube's direct responsibility.

06:20.060 --> 06:24.980
Matt implies it's YouTube's fault that predators are on the platform and therefore

06:24.980 --> 06:33.980
that YouTube deserves to be punished.

06:33.980 --> 06:39.500
Is it really YouTube's fault that unsupervised children ignore YouTube's minimum age requirement

06:39.500 --> 06:41.740
to upload videos of themselves?

06:41.740 --> 06:46.260
Is it YouTube's fault that foolish parents post videos of their children to a public

06:46.260 --> 06:52.580
platform for the whole world to see?

06:52.580 --> 06:56.760
Are we supposed to expect YouTube to moderate the comment sections of each and every video

06:56.760 --> 07:01.220
as if the individual uploaders are unable to do so themselves?

07:01.220 --> 07:05.940
YouTube has made its fair share of missteps in its handling of children on the platform,

07:05.940 --> 07:11.100
many of which I have personally criticized before, but in this video Matt heavily implies

07:11.100 --> 07:15.500
that YouTube is totally indifferent towards child endangerment and that they essentially

07:15.500 --> 07:31.020
allow predators to have a field day on the platform.

07:31.020 --> 07:35.420
This is a blatantly false narrative and can be disproven using events that happened the

07:35.420 --> 07:38.460
very week before Matt uploaded his video.

07:38.460 --> 07:43.360
The week of February 15th, multiple channels were terminated by YouTube without warning.

07:43.360 --> 07:47.620
They would later find out that they were unjust victims of a new YouTube initiative to remove

07:47.620 --> 07:49.940
videos with CP in the title.

07:49.940 --> 07:54.180
It just so happens that in this case, they forgot to whitelist videos about Club Penguin

07:54.180 --> 07:56.720
and Pokemon Go combat points.

07:56.720 --> 07:59.180
Was YouTube's decision clumsy and misguided?

07:59.180 --> 08:03.940
Yes, absolutely, but to claim that YouTube isn't trying to combat child endangerment

08:03.940 --> 08:06.380
on the platform is simply dishonest.

08:06.380 --> 08:13.560
This would pop up, this would load, and you would see that there was some sort of unusual

08:13.560 --> 08:17.400
behavior going on here and there's some sort of glitch in the algorithm.

08:17.400 --> 08:21.900
Not only does Matt mislead the audience about YouTube's efforts, he then goes on to misrepresent

08:21.900 --> 08:24.120
the entire YouTube community.

08:24.120 --> 08:29.740
Matt ends his expose with a montage of YouTubers complaining about demonetization, which is

08:29.740 --> 08:35.740
intended to paint YouTubers as self-centered and oblivious to the real problem on the platform.

08:35.740 --> 08:39.920
When confronted about his questionable claims on his subsequent live streams, Matt would

08:39.920 --> 08:44.620
get very defensive and often retort with the claim that YouTubers are purposely ignoring

08:44.620 --> 08:49.180
child endangerment because they are motivated only by their own selfish greed.

08:49.180 --> 08:51.520
That is literally your perspective.

08:51.520 --> 08:53.460
Your perspective is monetization.

08:53.460 --> 08:57.180
Frankly, they probably don't want to admit it, but they care more about money than they

08:57.180 --> 09:03.160
do about the fact that there's an easily exploitable ring of creepy child videos on YouTube.

09:03.160 --> 09:05.500
They care more about money.

09:05.500 --> 09:08.540
When I say they, I'm not talking about YouTube, I'm talking about these fucking YouTubers

09:08.540 --> 09:10.040
who are salty as fuck.

09:10.040 --> 09:11.040
Just admit it.

09:11.040 --> 09:12.040
You're salty.

09:12.040 --> 09:16.480
This was an oddly ignorant and divisive stance considering that many high profile channels

09:16.480 --> 09:20.860
have dedicated videos to combating child endangerment on the platform.

09:20.860 --> 09:25.620
Channels like Nerd City, H3H3, PewDiePie, and Pyrocynical have all exposed predatory

09:25.620 --> 09:26.620
content.

09:26.620 --> 09:31.580
Pyrocynical actually led to an entire wing of abusive content getting shut down.

09:31.580 --> 09:36.540
Paradoxically, Matt seems ignorant of this fact, yet he includes many of these same channels

09:36.540 --> 09:41.560
in his video while simultaneously shaming them for not caring about the issue.

09:41.560 --> 09:44.060
So does Matt watch these channels or not?

09:44.060 --> 09:49.260
Does he only pay attention to them specifically when they're complaining about getting demonetized?

09:49.260 --> 09:54.700
Matt's confrontational view of the YouTube community is so baffling that it becomes suspicious.

09:54.700 --> 09:59.020
What would Matt have to gain by throwing the entire YouTube community under the bus?

09:59.020 --> 10:03.700
I thought the issue here is child endangerment, which many YouTubers agree is a huge issue

10:03.700 --> 10:05.180
on the platform.

10:05.180 --> 10:07.960
Why would you not want them on your side?

10:07.960 --> 10:12.460
This doesn't make any sense, unless of course you believe that Matt Watson had a different

10:12.460 --> 10:13.660
motive in mind.

10:21.820 --> 10:25.260
And I'm not one of these people that says, oh get a real job.

10:25.260 --> 10:26.980
Being a YouTuber isn't a real job.

10:26.980 --> 10:28.380
I don't think that at all.

10:28.380 --> 10:29.980
20 minutes later.

10:29.980 --> 10:32.140
You know, oh my monetization, bro.

10:32.140 --> 10:34.180
Yeah, there you go.

10:34.180 --> 10:35.620
Get a part-time job.

10:35.620 --> 10:38.420
Uber, Uber looks good for you.

10:38.420 --> 10:43.540
Matt Watson's demonstrable lies, deception, and dishonesty should confirm him as an unreliable

10:43.540 --> 10:44.540
narrator.

10:44.540 --> 10:49.420
His dubious behavior reeks of someone with a hidden agenda, an agenda which becomes more

10:49.420 --> 10:53.260
obvious with Matt's call to action in his exposé.

10:53.260 --> 10:57.300
I hope with the video evidence that I have that more people find out about adverts being

10:57.300 --> 11:02.780
played on videos like this, and that YouTube shits the bed ten times worse than they did

11:02.780 --> 11:04.460
in 2017.

11:04.460 --> 11:10.500
Matt's plan to protect children on YouTube is to incite a mass boycott of YouTube's advertisers.

11:10.500 --> 11:12.740
Guys, please contact them.

11:12.740 --> 11:14.940
Trust me, these companies care.

11:14.940 --> 11:16.020
People care.

11:16.020 --> 11:19.100
Don't worry, if this sounds ludicrous to you, you're correct.

11:19.100 --> 11:23.100
But it kind of makes sense if you're all riled up and bash your head against the wall a few

11:23.100 --> 11:24.900
times.

11:24.900 --> 11:30.020
Matt's rationale is to force YouTube to protect kids by hitting them where it hurts, in their

11:30.020 --> 11:31.020
wallets.

11:31.020 --> 11:33.940
Because remember, the only time that YouTube is going to do something is when it starts

11:33.940 --> 11:38.060
to hit their pocket, when it starts to hit their wallet.

11:38.060 --> 11:42.860
And the only way to get them to respond is through their wallet, and the only way to

11:42.860 --> 11:47.440
hit Google and hit YouTube is where it hurts, in their wallet.

11:47.440 --> 11:52.100
Never mind the point that YouTube is already making an effort to stop predators, Matt is

11:52.100 --> 11:56.780
suggesting that hundreds of thousands of YouTube creators across the entire site lose

11:56.780 --> 12:02.420
revenue because of a few unmoderated comment sections completely out of their control.

12:02.420 --> 12:07.500
Matt is suggesting that rather than flagging and reporting the abusive videos, we take

12:07.500 --> 12:14.020
money away from innocent creators so that YouTube will flag and report abusive videos.

12:14.020 --> 12:18.660
If you're not quite up to speed on how YouTube ads work, companies pay YouTube every time

12:18.660 --> 12:22.600
one of their ads gets placed on a video, and the revenue then gets split between the

12:22.600 --> 12:24.740
creator and the platform.

12:24.740 --> 12:28.240
YouTube and its creators exist in a symbiotic relationship.

12:28.240 --> 12:32.980
This is the primary reason why inciting ad boycotts makes no sense.

12:32.980 --> 12:37.100
Because to stab at the heart of YouTube, you must first drive the blade through thousands

12:37.100 --> 12:38.900
of innocent channels.

12:38.900 --> 12:45.080
Even if YouTube took 100% of the revenue, Matt's plan would still be totally nonsensical.

12:45.080 --> 12:50.160
YouTube is one of the few massive websites that is not publicly traded on any stock exchange.

12:50.160 --> 12:55.360
As I mentioned in previous videos, no one knows whether YouTube is even profitable.

12:55.360 --> 13:00.120
It's clear at this point that Google does not keep YouTube running as a lucrative venture.

13:00.120 --> 13:04.760
They support YouTube because of its enormous market share in online video.

13:04.760 --> 13:09.240
What YouTube lacks in profit, it more than makes up for in influence.

13:09.240 --> 13:13.440
YouTube itself may not bring in the big bucks for Google, but what it does bring in is the

13:13.440 --> 13:15.080
customers who will.

13:15.080 --> 13:19.500
For this reason, YouTube will likely never have to worry about financial woes as long

13:19.500 --> 13:25.680
as Google stays in business, which is why advertiser boycotts hold no actual leverage.

13:25.680 --> 13:30.440
Every time this happens, the platform gets impacted far less than the creators, who don't

13:30.440 --> 13:33.640
have the financial padding of a trillion dollar company.

13:33.640 --> 13:38.900
At some point, it seemed that Matt cared more about punishing YouTubers than punishing predators.

13:38.900 --> 13:43.840
He demonstrated this with his repeated insistence that any YouTuber who disagreed with inciting

13:43.840 --> 13:48.460
an ad boycott was greedy.

13:48.460 --> 13:53.060
When YouTubers like Nerd City attempted to reason with Matt on these issues, he responded

13:53.060 --> 13:54.780
with total belligerence.

13:54.780 --> 13:57.920
The community was on his side for the first few days.

13:57.920 --> 14:01.820
People were sharing the video, we were stopping by his chat and saying like, you know, how

14:01.820 --> 14:02.820
can we help?

14:02.820 --> 14:04.100
Thank you for what you did.

14:04.100 --> 14:05.340
Nerd City is here.

14:05.340 --> 14:06.340
Okay.

14:06.340 --> 14:07.340
Who's Nerd City?

14:07.340 --> 14:08.740
I got to look all these people up.

14:08.740 --> 14:13.660
People like myself and Leon Lush and Keemstar were reaching out to him and saying, hey man,

14:13.660 --> 14:15.060
we're on the same page here.

14:15.060 --> 14:21.220
What you found is a problem and YouTube needs to address it, but pump the brakes on the

14:21.220 --> 14:22.740
contacting advertisers.

14:22.740 --> 14:24.300
That is not going to solve the problem.

14:24.820 --> 14:27.460
It's just going to injure YouTube, like potentially fatally.

14:27.460 --> 14:31.780
Matt just kept dismissing anything that YouTubers were saying to him about like, don't contact

14:31.780 --> 14:32.780
advertisers.

14:32.780 --> 14:33.780
Like don't do this yet.

14:33.780 --> 14:35.380
That's, that's the nuclear option.

14:35.380 --> 14:38.300
His stubbornness started to become the problem.

14:38.300 --> 14:42.700
Like he pretended he was listening and he would ask, act like, all right, man, I want

14:42.700 --> 14:43.700
to talk.

14:43.700 --> 14:44.700
Yeah.

14:44.700 --> 14:45.700
I'd love to talk to Keemstar.

14:45.700 --> 14:48.820
And he would put someone on live to talk on Discord.

14:48.820 --> 14:52.580
And then once they would say something he didn't like, he just, you know, put his hands

14:52.580 --> 14:55.980
over his ears and said, sorry, no, no, no, what I'm doing is right.

14:55.980 --> 15:00.340
And you're just greedy and YouTube is going to have to suffer for this.

15:00.340 --> 15:03.700
This means that YouTubers are going to suffer, unfortunately.

15:03.700 --> 15:08.980
The only way to get YouTube to do something about this is to hit them where it hurts.

15:08.980 --> 15:10.700
And that's in their wallet.

15:10.700 --> 15:14.980
There was never a point when Matt elaborated on how his plan was more effective than just

15:14.980 --> 15:17.260
manually reporting the predators.

15:17.260 --> 15:22.420
The rhetoric in his streams was akin to that of a political rally, featuring lots of sloganeering,

15:22.420 --> 15:24.460
dogmatic statements and emotional appeal.

15:24.460 --> 15:27.340
I mean, this is disgusting, disgusting comment.

15:27.340 --> 15:28.340
I'm disgusted.

15:28.340 --> 15:29.340
I'm disgusted.

15:29.340 --> 15:30.340
I'm angry.

15:30.340 --> 15:31.340
How does this exist?

15:31.340 --> 15:33.340
That's all I have to say.

15:33.340 --> 15:34.340
Disgusted.

15:34.340 --> 15:36.020
I've been more emotional in this video that I've wanted to be.

15:36.020 --> 15:38.560
I wanted to be more collected and calm.

15:38.560 --> 15:43.620
Matt used his stream almost exclusively as a way to galvanize his audience into contacting

15:43.620 --> 15:44.940
brands.

15:44.940 --> 15:49.540
At times, it felt like pressuring advertisers to pull their funding was the only thing Matt

15:49.540 --> 15:51.540
cared about.

15:51.540 --> 15:54.260
Oh, yes, man.

15:54.260 --> 15:55.260
Yes.

15:55.260 --> 16:02.500
Dude, that's what I'm talking about.

16:02.500 --> 16:04.500
We did it.

16:04.500 --> 16:06.480
Thanks for bringing it to our attention, Jamie.

16:06.480 --> 16:09.900
Our team is aware and investigating this material.

16:09.900 --> 16:13.000
It's good.

16:13.000 --> 16:17.440
Now at this point, some of you may be starting to realize that Matt Watson wasn't quite the

16:17.440 --> 16:20.500
noble vigilante that he originally appeared to be.

16:20.500 --> 16:31.700
Unfortunately for YouTube, too many people were unable to see through the illusion.

16:31.700 --> 16:36.480
The public outrage sparked by Matt's video was astounding, to say the least.

16:36.480 --> 16:41.080
By morning, it had skyrocketed to the top of our videos, becoming one of the most widely

16:41.080 --> 16:43.680
shared videos in the history of the site.

16:43.680 --> 16:48.760
Within a week of its upload, more than 70 news articles had reported on the controversy,

16:48.760 --> 16:52.000
with most directly linking Matt's video to readers.

16:52.000 --> 16:56.380
With all this considered, Matt Watson had single-handedly incited possibly the most

16:56.380 --> 16:59.680
circulated controversy in the history of YouTube.

16:59.680 --> 17:04.680
In terms of initial media coverage, only Logan Paul's most infamous controversy was comparable

17:04.680 --> 17:06.140
in scale.

17:06.140 --> 17:10.540
Matt's video was reported on so extensively that it raises the question of how exactly

17:10.540 --> 17:12.280
it spread so far.

17:12.280 --> 17:16.620
As I mentioned previously, many high-profile YouTubers have covered the issue of child

17:16.620 --> 17:20.920
endangerment before, yet they hardly received any mainstream coverage.

17:20.920 --> 17:25.960
If you want to compare apples to apples, in 2018 a French YouTuber with hundreds of thousands

17:25.960 --> 17:30.520
of followers uploaded a video covering the same topic as Matt, with coincidentally the

17:30.520 --> 17:32.520
exact same hashtag.

17:32.520 --> 17:36.840
Why didn't this video spawn 70 articles or hit the front page of Reddit?

17:36.840 --> 17:38.440
What made Matt's video different?

17:38.440 --> 17:43.140
Well, aside from the language barrier, it's highly likely that Matt Watson employed some

17:43.140 --> 17:47.080
rather sneaky tactics to nudge his video in the right direction.

17:47.080 --> 17:52.400
Matt published his video at 11.27 PM Eastern Time, which is very late in the evening by

17:52.400 --> 17:54.080
YouTube standards.

17:54.080 --> 17:58.520
Most YouTubers choose to upload in the afternoon or early evening so they can capitalize off

17:58.520 --> 18:00.360
peak internet traffic.

18:00.360 --> 18:05.000
Matt deliberately published his video after most people had gone to sleep, a poor strategy

18:05.000 --> 18:10.300
for YouTube views, but a necessary strategy for what he likely had planned.

18:10.300 --> 18:15.280
Only 40 minutes after Matt published his video on YouTube, he posted the link to Reddit.

18:15.280 --> 18:19.280
About 90 minutes after that, he begins live streaming on his YouTube channel where he

18:19.280 --> 18:22.640
links his viewers to the Reddit post so that they can upvote it.

18:22.640 --> 18:24.120
Link in the chat will upvote them.

18:24.120 --> 18:25.120
Yeah, that's a good idea.

18:25.120 --> 18:26.120
Actually, you know what?

18:26.120 --> 18:27.120
I'm going to stay on the chat right now.

18:27.120 --> 18:28.440
Okay guys, it's up.

18:28.440 --> 18:37.240
So I'm going to post the link over here in the window, post, that's my post.

18:37.240 --> 18:39.800
So yeah, upvote that all you can.

18:39.800 --> 18:44.340
This is a strict violation of the solicitation rule on our videos and should have led to

18:44.340 --> 18:45.460
the post removal.

18:45.460 --> 18:51.220
However, at around 1 AM on a weekday, most of the mods were probably asleep and the violation

18:51.220 --> 18:53.220
went completely unnoticed.

18:53.220 --> 18:57.800
Matt's initial karma injection was enough to push the video to the front page and after

18:57.800 --> 19:01.220
that point, the Reddit hive mind did the rest.

19:01.220 --> 19:05.540
Almost by design, the video was inundated by a furious wave of outsiders who had little

19:05.540 --> 19:08.200
to no understanding of how YouTube works.

19:08.200 --> 19:19.220
And before the YouTube community could respond, the video was already too big to fail.

19:19.220 --> 19:23.840
The media coverage of Matt Watson's video was as dubious as any other aspect of the

19:23.840 --> 19:24.840
controversy.

19:24.840 --> 19:29.460
Dozens of publications jumped on a bandwagon to elevate Matt's video as if he made a ground

19:29.460 --> 19:30.920
breaking discovery.

19:30.920 --> 19:34.260
This issue had been discussed by YouTube commentators for years.

19:34.260 --> 19:37.340
Why did everyone decide to get outraged by it now?

19:37.340 --> 19:41.740
Was the word wormhole just a trigger for people to suddenly pay attention?

19:41.740 --> 19:46.020
Last spring I was able to discuss the issue of child predation with anxiety war, who has

19:46.020 --> 19:49.160
become the modern day Chris Hansen of YouTube.

19:49.160 --> 19:53.500
Through his years of experience in identifying and confronting predators, he identified that

19:53.500 --> 19:57.520
the most dangerous sites for children are instant messaging apps like Snapchat and the

19:57.520 --> 20:01.860
now defunct Kik, which allow predators to communicate directly with children.

20:01.860 --> 20:22.580
YouTube's direct message system was buried in the video manager for years, and in 2018

20:22.580 --> 20:24.780
they removed the feature entirely.

20:24.780 --> 20:29.780
Content wise, apps like Instagram and TikTok are far more dangerous for children than YouTube,

20:29.780 --> 20:34.060
with Instagram ranked as the leading app in giving kids depression among other psychiatric

20:34.060 --> 20:40.300
issues, and TikTok continually luring unaware kids to injure themselves in ridiculous challenges.

20:40.300 --> 20:44.780
Both of these apps also have an easily accessible instant messaging feature which allow predators

20:44.780 --> 20:46.840
to speak directly to minors.

20:46.840 --> 20:51.000
As far as child endangerment goes, YouTube should be far from the top of anyone's list

20:51.000 --> 20:55.960
of the most dangerous apps for kids, yet the media seems to treat YouTube far more harshly

20:55.960 --> 20:57.980
than any of these other sites.

20:57.980 --> 21:01.420
Apps like TikTok are often portrayed as fun and quirky.

21:01.420 --> 21:06.660
You never see any outrage mobs trying to incite an ad boycott of Snapchat or Instagram.

21:06.660 --> 21:11.260
YouTube certainly has its fair share of issues with its handling of children, but to scrutinize

21:11.260 --> 21:16.300
them while simultaneously ignoring far more dangerous sites is either dishonest or downright

21:16.300 --> 21:17.500
foolish.

21:17.500 --> 21:20.800
Is this all just another case of boomers being boomers?

21:20.800 --> 21:25.460
Maybe so, but something else about the media's coverage of Matt's video is far harder to

21:25.460 --> 21:26.680
explain.

21:26.680 --> 21:32.000
Out of all 73 articles written about the controversy, not one featured any interview

21:32.000 --> 21:33.280
with Matt.

21:33.280 --> 21:37.580
Every one of the articles either cites the video itself or a different article covering

21:37.580 --> 21:39.080
the controversy.

21:39.080 --> 21:44.680
Only two out of the 73 articles even mentioned reaching out to Matt for an interview.

21:44.680 --> 21:49.200
This contradicts Matt's own claims of supposedly contacting media outlets himself.

21:49.200 --> 21:53.900
I've written a report and I'm sending that report out to every news outlet that I possibly

21:53.900 --> 21:54.900
can.

21:54.900 --> 22:00.060
I get that nowadays our standards for journalistic publications are at an all-time low, but this

22:00.060 --> 22:01.700
is just ridiculous.

22:01.700 --> 22:05.820
Usually when reporting on a story, it's common practice to base it off some sort of

22:05.820 --> 22:11.140
credible research from a verifiable expert in their domain, not some unknown dude who

22:11.140 --> 22:13.100
made an angry YouTube video.

22:13.100 --> 22:17.880
But even in the off chance that you do decide to platform a fringe weirdo with no credentials

22:17.880 --> 22:22.660
whatsoever, you should at least be able to interview the guy and have him elaborate on

22:22.660 --> 22:25.180
his more extraordinary claims.

22:25.180 --> 22:29.500
Of course, most of these publications probably did reach out to Matt, which presents an even

22:29.500 --> 22:34.020
stranger implication that Matt Watson outright refused to be interviewed.

22:34.020 --> 22:36.500
You know, I just want to create some awareness for this.

22:36.500 --> 22:38.940
I want to try and get this hashtag trending.

22:38.940 --> 22:46.500
I have concealed my identity when I did it because I have emailed several news outlets,

22:46.500 --> 22:52.660
BuzzFeed and stuff like that.

22:52.660 --> 22:58.140
And so my concern with contacting the FBI or the police is that could someone like myself

22:58.140 --> 23:06.440
be implicated by simply sending the information to them or the recordings to them that have

23:06.440 --> 23:10.020
these sort of borderline thumbnails in them?

23:10.020 --> 23:11.740
Could I be implicated in something?

23:11.740 --> 23:19.060
So BuzzFeed, as an example, I can send something to them anonymously and they will protect

23:19.060 --> 23:20.060
my identity.

23:20.060 --> 23:24.340
BuzzFeed, as an example, they will protect my identity.

23:24.340 --> 23:28.900
So I feel like by sending it to them, you know, I've started the process here.

23:28.900 --> 23:30.740
We're talking about this stuff.

23:30.740 --> 23:32.020
Somebody's talking about Fox News.

23:32.020 --> 23:33.860
I don't like Fox News.

23:33.860 --> 23:38.240
Why would the leader of a major social movement turn down the free publicity from appearing

23:38.240 --> 23:41.460
in dozens of articles from major publications?

23:41.460 --> 23:45.540
For someone seemingly so passionate about the issue, someone who claims to be just a

23:45.540 --> 23:50.540
concerned citizen doing the right thing, what would he have to lose by answering a few questions

23:50.540 --> 23:51.980
for reporters?

23:51.980 --> 23:55.700
All I'm doing here, dude, is I'm just trying to make some awareness about this whole thing.

23:55.700 --> 23:57.640
I'm just trying to create awareness for this.

23:57.640 --> 23:59.380
You guys are helping to create awareness for this.

23:59.380 --> 24:01.200
We're all creating awareness for this right now.

24:01.200 --> 24:05.080
We have one single solitary purpose for being here right now, and that is to bring awareness

24:05.080 --> 24:06.080
to this issue.

24:06.080 --> 24:07.780
Hashtag YouTube wake up.

24:07.780 --> 24:12.280
Anyone in Matt's position should have been fully cooperative with the media, unless,

24:12.280 --> 24:22.960
of course, they had something to hide.

24:22.960 --> 24:27.280
Another aspect of the whole situation that most people missed was Matt's inconsistent

24:27.280 --> 24:29.840
outlook of corporate accountability.

24:29.840 --> 24:34.500
Throughout his whole campaign, he had a remarkable ability to flip flop between a staunch opponent

24:34.500 --> 24:37.380
of corporate abuse to an outright bootlicker.

24:37.380 --> 24:42.100
Nestle was quick to pull their ads from YouTube amidst the controversy, despite undergoing

24:42.100 --> 24:46.840
numerous lawsuits for using child slavery to harvest their cocoa beans.

24:46.840 --> 24:51.760
Disney also pulled their ads over concerns of child exploitation, despite notoriously

24:51.760 --> 24:55.960
exploiting children for years in their Chinese toy factories.

24:55.960 --> 25:00.400
Matt Watson seemed oblivious to all of this, as he actively aided both of these companies

25:00.400 --> 25:03.080
in his supposed mission to help children.

25:03.080 --> 25:06.440
No matter who you are, no matter what your politics are, no matter what your skin color

25:06.440 --> 25:10.340
is, this is about protecting children, and it's intrinsic to human nature to protect

25:10.340 --> 25:11.340
children.

25:11.340 --> 25:14.980
Hey pal, you just blowing from stupid town?

25:14.980 --> 25:19.540
Eventually, pretty much all of these companies quietly returned to YouTube a few weeks after

25:19.540 --> 25:21.700
the controversy had blown over.

25:21.700 --> 25:25.540
Like most corporate stunts, it was all just smoke and mirrors.

25:25.540 --> 25:30.940
So much for boycotting child exploitation, it turns out that YouTube's proverbial wallet

25:30.940 --> 25:36.880
runs very deep, and $8,000 refunds aren't a steep price to pay when you make $15 billion

25:36.880 --> 25:38.360
in annual revenue.

25:38.360 --> 25:42.840
Ultimately, Matt's whole plan of forcing an ad boycott amounted to nothing more than

25:42.840 --> 25:46.560
inconveniencing innocent creators for a few weeks.

25:46.560 --> 25:50.900
The advertisers predictably returned, and everything went back to normal like how it

25:50.900 --> 25:53.760
always does after any YouTube controversy.

25:53.760 --> 25:58.720
Yet another example of why ad boycotts on YouTube make no sense whatsoever, and Matt's

25:58.720 --> 26:03.540
whimsical double standard of corporate abuse was yet another example of his suspicious

26:03.540 --> 26:14.240
behavior.

26:14.240 --> 26:18.340
So let's once again visit the strange topic of Matt's old videos.

26:18.340 --> 26:22.740
Although they were ignored by practically every major news outlet, the YouTube community

26:22.740 --> 26:27.340
quickly gathered them as ammunition to defend the platform from his deception.

26:27.340 --> 26:31.320
Some of you have probably seen this clip, where Matt allegedly harasses a girl on the

26:31.320 --> 26:37.480
sidewalk.

26:37.480 --> 26:41.920
Most YouTubers utilized this clip to reach the conclusion that Matt was an unscrupulous

26:41.920 --> 26:44.320
creep and a failed content creator.

26:44.320 --> 26:49.040
However, diving deeper into Matt's past content reveals that many YouTube commentators

26:49.040 --> 26:51.640
had missed the greater context of his origins.

26:51.640 --> 26:55.960
The few mentions of his channel in articles and forum posts reveal that Matt started on

26:55.960 --> 26:58.660
YouTube by making Men's Health videos.

26:58.660 --> 27:03.980
He was perhaps most known for his NoFap vlogs, which he uploaded to the Matt's What It Is

27:03.980 --> 27:08.540
channel, the same account that would eventually host the YouTube Wake Up video and his subsequent

27:08.540 --> 27:09.540
streams.

27:09.540 --> 27:12.600
Matt's original account dates back to 2016.

27:12.600 --> 27:16.900
One year later, Matt would open up a new account called Totally Uncreative, to which he would

27:16.900 --> 27:23.740
upload what he described as comedy videos.

27:23.740 --> 27:28.240
This is the channel that spawned Matt's more questionable content, which was later circulated

27:28.240 --> 27:33.040
by the YouTube commentators, most of whom would assume that the content was genuine.

27:33.040 --> 27:37.620
Matt's eventual Reddit history would contradict this theory and imply that his entire catalog

27:37.620 --> 27:41.880
of videos on both channels were attempts at ironic satire.

27:41.880 --> 27:52.540
I found myself kind of browsing through a lot of your old videos, you know, really got

27:52.540 --> 27:57.100
me wondering, you know, what happened, you know, you haven't posted anything in close

27:57.100 --> 27:58.460
to five, six months.

27:58.460 --> 28:03.860
And I found a comment that you had pinned, I think on your most recent video that kind

28:03.860 --> 28:08.460
of announced that, uh, that you were done, man, that you were, you were done with a whole

28:08.460 --> 28:12.560
YouTube thing and...

28:12.560 --> 28:18.600
Mysteriously, the old Matt's What It Is videos were archived and re-uploaded by an anonymous

28:18.600 --> 28:22.040
channel a week after the controversy had subsided.

28:22.040 --> 28:26.560
Although the nature or purpose of this channel is unknown, it is rather strange that it not

28:26.560 --> 28:31.480
only archived Matt's old videos prior to their sudden deletion, but chose to re-upload them

28:31.480 --> 28:35.000
only after they served little purpose to discredit him.

28:35.020 --> 28:39.700
Ultimately, Matt's old content serves as yet another wrinkle in the tapestry of confusing

28:39.700 --> 28:45.500
circumstances around him, and provides further reason to doubt his motives for starting the controversy.

28:51.020 --> 28:56.580
On February 19th, just 48 hours after arriving on the scene, Matt streamed on YouTube for

28:56.580 --> 28:57.840
the final time.

28:57.840 --> 28:58.840
So that's it, man.

28:58.840 --> 28:59.840
I think we're set.

28:59.840 --> 29:00.840
Thank you all.

29:00.840 --> 29:05.220
Uh, you know, that's all I have to say, man.

29:05.220 --> 29:06.540
Peace out.

29:06.540 --> 29:10.500
After the stream went dark, Matt Watson disappeared from YouTube.

29:10.500 --> 29:14.700
The YouTube Wake Up Twitter account, which was presumably operated by Matt, remained

29:14.700 --> 29:18.900
active until the beginning of March before also falling dormant.

29:18.900 --> 29:22.840
Matt's last known online activity can be found on his Reddit account.

29:22.840 --> 29:28.340
On February 22nd, three days after his final stream, Matt posted a long, rambling, mostly

29:28.340 --> 29:32.500
incoherent comment on the newly minted YouTube Wake Up subreddit.

29:32.500 --> 29:37.620
In the post, he generalizes the mounting criticism as slanderous and continues to parrot the

29:37.620 --> 29:40.520
same rhetoric about YouTubers being greedy.

29:40.520 --> 29:45.660
He then goes on to sanctimoniously lecture us about the dangers of social media, presumably

29:45.660 --> 29:48.960
as a means of accounting for his future absence.

29:48.960 --> 29:54.080
As of July 1st, 2019, Matt Watson has vanished from the web.

29:54.080 --> 29:59.240
Many details about his personal life or current whereabouts remain a mystery to this day.

29:59.240 --> 30:04.120
Later in 2019, the COPPA controversy once again placed YouTube's child safety standards

30:04.120 --> 30:05.520
in serious doubt.

30:05.520 --> 30:10.960
Despite COPPA providing Matt with ample incentive to return, he has thus far decided to remain

30:10.960 --> 30:15.420
a poltergeist to the digital world, leaving the rest of us to wonder what in the world

30:15.420 --> 30:16.740
just happened.

30:16.740 --> 30:20.940
When we come back, we will discuss the alternative theories of what Matt was really trying to

30:20.940 --> 30:44.860
accomplish by making YouTube wake up.

30:50.940 --> 31:12.780
Hi, I'm Dr. Spiral, and I'm here today to talk about Keeps, the easiest and most affordable

31:12.780 --> 31:16.340
innovation in baldness prevention technology.

31:16.340 --> 31:20.180
Millions of men make the mistake of taking their hair for granted until it's too late.

31:20.180 --> 31:24.940
Once you go bald, your self-worth flies out the window faster than my medical license.

31:24.940 --> 31:29.300
Everyone knows that hair is the only true source of a man's power, which is why baldies

31:29.300 --> 31:35.620
burn through thousands on tacky wigs, smelly tonics, and painful implants.

31:35.620 --> 31:38.600
Keeps will help you battle baldness before it's too late.

31:38.600 --> 31:42.920

31:42.920 --> 31:46.820

Please buy the product, you guys.

32:02.660 --> 32:10.340
I can't take any more of these ad boycotts.

32:10.340 --> 32:14.860
The prevailing narrative regarding the YouTube wake up controversy is pretty much everything

32:14.860 --> 32:17.220
that was reported by the mainstream media.

32:17.220 --> 32:21.480
The general public assumed that Matt was simply acting as a good Samaritan and exposing the

32:21.480 --> 32:23.740
issue as part of his civic duty.

32:23.740 --> 32:27.660
Most people, especially the ones on Reddit, assumed that Matt was portraying these issues

32:27.660 --> 32:29.580
fairly and honestly.

32:29.580 --> 32:33.660
The Reddit traffic and heavy media coverage were thought to be organic and a result of

32:33.660 --> 32:38.100
people passionately caring about the issue by demanding accountability from YouTube.

32:38.100 --> 32:42.580
For those outside the YouTube scene, Matt's mission to contact advertisers seemed like

32:42.580 --> 32:47.600
a reasonable enough method to inspire change and the subsequent advertiser boycott came

32:47.600 --> 32:51.300
as a logical consequence of Matt's well-intentioned campaign.

32:51.300 --> 32:55.660
For almost everyone aware of the controversy, this was a satisfactory explanation for the

32:55.660 --> 32:57.060
sequence of events.

32:57.060 --> 33:02.220
However, as we discussed previously, delving deeper into the details of the situation reveals

33:02.220 --> 33:07.340
a lot of strange inconsistencies that place the mainstream theory into serious doubt.

33:07.340 --> 33:12.500
The following theories will attempt to account for the most dubious discrepancies, more specifically

33:12.500 --> 33:17.380
analyzing Matt's behavior to deduce his true motivation for inciting the YouTube wake-up

33:17.380 --> 33:18.380
controversy.

33:18.380 --> 33:26.700
So today I was on the internet and I was looking at how to build a successful YouTube channel

33:26.700 --> 33:31.100
and one of the two things they recommended was to be super high energy!

33:31.100 --> 33:35.240
Given the sequence of events, the first theory many would consider is that Matt Watson wanted

33:35.240 --> 33:38.380
to get revenge on the platform for some unknown reason.

33:38.380 --> 33:43.080
Based on his apparent hatred for YouTube specifically and his unwillingness to cooperate

33:43.080 --> 33:49.580
with YouTubers in any capacity.

33:49.580 --> 33:54.680
The crux of this theory comes from the inconsistency of Matt's overall knowledge of the platform.

33:54.680 --> 33:59.700
He had no problem setting up a live stream, but claimed to have no idea how to edit monetization

33:59.700 --> 34:08.140
settings.

34:08.140 --> 34:13.040
He seemed very familiar with watching certain channels, but somehow neglected obvious examples

34:13.040 --> 34:17.280
of those same YouTubers supporting the cause he claimed to represent.

34:17.280 --> 34:21.700
Even though Matt's behavior reflected someone with years of experience on the platform,

34:21.700 --> 34:26.420
he would frequently play dumb to his audience, acting ignorant to very basic features on

34:26.420 --> 34:33.260
the site.

34:33.260 --> 34:37.980
Of course, many commentators would eventually expose that Matt did, in fact, spend at least

34:37.980 --> 34:43.260
two years making content before the controversy, content which he deliberately tried to obfuscate

34:43.260 --> 34:44.700
from public view.

34:44.700 --> 34:48.940
Much of YouTube's commentary community seemed to reach the consensus that Matt Watson was

34:48.940 --> 35:01.900
a failed YouTuber who manufactured the controversy for views and attention.

35:01.900 --> 35:06.700
After spending years trying and failing to grow his channel, Matt began to resent YouTube

35:06.700 --> 35:11.060
and its more successful creators, with that resentment eventually boiling over into a

35:11.060 --> 35:12.540
full-on vendetta.

35:12.540 --> 35:17.860
Eventually, he hatched a plan to sabotage the platform and its greedy creators.

35:17.860 --> 35:22.100
YouTube Wake Up was a result of Matt actively seeking revenge on YouTube.

35:22.100 --> 35:27.140
While the rogue YouTuber theory may explain Matt's abrasive attitude towards other creators,

35:27.140 --> 35:30.060
it doesn't account for many other discrepancies.

35:30.060 --> 35:34.620
First of all, the commentator consensus that Matt manufactured the controversy for fame

35:34.620 --> 35:39.500
doesn't hold up when you factor in his subsequent disappearance from the internet as a whole.

35:39.500 --> 35:44.540
Matt clearly acted with grander motivations than simply furthering his own status.

35:44.540 --> 35:49.060
Additionally, this theory creates inconsistencies with Matt's level of competence throughout

35:49.060 --> 35:50.540
the whole process.

35:50.540 --> 35:54.700
Are we supposed to believe that Matt is capable of manipulating thousands of people to do

35:54.700 --> 35:59.060
his bidding, but he can't figure out how to make people watch his YouTube videos?

35:59.060 --> 36:03.300
If he knew how to exploit Reddit Karma to boost his viewership, why not just use that

36:03.300 --> 36:05.860
tactic on his existing content?

36:05.860 --> 36:10.420
This theory paints Matt as a failed YouTuber who grew disillusioned with the platform,

36:10.420 --> 36:15.100
yet he gained almost 20,000 subscribers and more than a million total views in just two

36:15.100 --> 36:20.260
years of making videos, which is far more successful than most channels at that point.

36:20.260 --> 36:25.020
With that being said, his apparent motive for hating YouTube appears much more flimsy,

36:25.020 --> 36:29.240
suggesting that he had a different incentive than just getting revenge on the popular kids.

36:29.240 --> 36:33.540
And even if he did start the controversy because he hated the platform, why was his

36:33.540 --> 36:36.600
campaign so successful in particular?

36:36.600 --> 36:40.780
Every year, dozens of videos come out seeking to expose YouTube's dirty dealings to the

36:40.780 --> 36:42.200
general public.

36:42.200 --> 36:47.520
And so far, Matt's video stands alone as the only YouTube expose to garner significant

36:47.520 --> 36:49.280
mainstream attention.

36:49.280 --> 36:51.900
Was it all a coincidence or just dumb luck?

36:51.900 --> 36:56.360
Could be either, but it's far more likely that a few hidden entities had vested interest

36:56.360 --> 36:58.480
in Matt's video succeeding.

36:58.480 --> 37:02.840
I am once again asking for your financial support.

37:02.840 --> 37:06.400
In leftist communities online, there's been a fixation at how YouTube's algorithm has

37:06.400 --> 37:08.120
promoted right-wing content.

37:08.120 --> 37:12.640
Many argue that YouTube has inadvertently created a pipeline in which viewers are recommended

37:12.640 --> 37:15.680
political content that gradually radicalizes them.

37:15.680 --> 37:19.400
So you'll start with one or two videos of a red-haired college feminist and end up on

37:19.400 --> 37:21.840
videos about demographic replacement.

37:21.840 --> 37:25.800
This is the thesis of ideas like the PewDiePie pipeline as well as the motivation for them

37:25.800 --> 37:27.840
to produce their own content.

37:27.840 --> 37:31.900
While Matt's video predates the PewDiePie pipeline, this asserted rabbit hole was covered

37:31.900 --> 37:36.280
extensively in a research paper by Rebecca Lewis for Data and Society.

37:36.280 --> 37:41.080
Published in September of 2018, the abstract summarizes their view of YouTube rather well.

37:41.080 --> 37:44.720
YouTube is a principal online news source for young people, which is why it's concerning

37:44.720 --> 37:49.320
that YouTube, a subsidiary of Google, has become the single most important hub by which

37:49.320 --> 37:53.720
an extensive network of far-right influencers profit from broadcasting propaganda to young

37:53.720 --> 37:54.760
viewers.

37:54.760 --> 37:58.920
This study received not just news coverage, but was also the foundation for this video

37:58.920 --> 38:03.680
by YouTuber Three Arrows, which has since accumulated nearly 1 million views.

38:03.680 --> 38:06.080
How is this relevant to Matt Watson, you may ask?

38:06.080 --> 38:10.520
Well, nearly one month after Matt Watson swore to never return again, he made a reappearance

38:10.520 --> 38:11.520
on Reddit.

38:11.520 --> 38:14.700
YouTube's algorithm is the mirror of its average user.

38:14.700 --> 38:17.080
Start with PewDiePie and with F*****.

38:17.080 --> 38:19.400
Start with Joe Rogan and with Shapiro.

38:19.400 --> 38:22.120
Start with news and with the F*****.

38:22.120 --> 38:25.980
Less than two months later, Matt Watson posted again in the subreddit, this time in a thread

38:25.980 --> 38:27.520
calling for action.

38:27.520 --> 38:28.520
Its title reads,

38:28.520 --> 38:30.040
Turn off your ad blocker.

38:30.040 --> 38:31.520
Go to f****** subreddits.

38:31.520 --> 38:34.200
Take screenshots of ads next to f****** content.

38:34.200 --> 38:37.920
Send the screenshots to companies and ask why they're promoting f******ism.

38:37.920 --> 38:39.800
Matt Watson simply commented on this post,

38:39.800 --> 38:43.260
Yup, I can attest that this strategy works.

38:43.260 --> 38:46.080
There are a number of reasons as to why this is significant.

38:46.080 --> 38:50.720
Firstly, one has to remember that at this point, Matt had already essentially been forgotten.

38:50.720 --> 38:55.680
No one seemed to recognize him when he commented, even though he referenced his grand accomplishment.

38:55.680 --> 39:00.280
So one should view this as his mask off moment, how he behaves when he's no longer in the

39:00.280 --> 39:01.680
public's eye.

39:01.680 --> 39:05.180
But you also have to take this into consideration with the context of his content before the

39:05.180 --> 39:06.880
YouTube wake up scandal.

39:06.880 --> 39:11.600
On his comedy channel, he made videos mocking the Manosphere, where he would parody f******

39:11.600 --> 39:12.700
pickup artists.

39:12.700 --> 39:17.160
He clearly had a vested interest in opposing these fringe communities, and these comments

39:17.160 --> 39:21.120
reveal that he views ad boycotts as a proportionate response to them.

39:21.120 --> 39:24.760
So it's not out of the realm of possibility that he had an ulterior motive.

39:24.760 --> 39:28.800
Additionally, it provides an explanation for his disdain of other YouTubers.

39:28.800 --> 39:31.760
He comments on a thread mocking Boogie2988,

39:31.760 --> 39:33.760
YouTube and its content creators are one and the same.

39:33.760 --> 39:36.040
They only give a f*** about money.

39:36.040 --> 39:37.040
Enforcing policies?

39:37.040 --> 39:38.040
Nah.

39:38.040 --> 39:42.120
These content creators are such self-centered pieces of trash, there is a direct correlation

39:42.120 --> 39:45.800
between how garbage their content is and how frequently you'll find them wincing about

39:45.800 --> 39:48.560
SJW boogie men coming for their adsense.

39:48.560 --> 39:53.160
Remember, when he first released his video, he framed himself as an outsider.

39:53.160 --> 39:56.880
But as that facade began to slip away, he revealed that he was fairly knowledgeable

39:56.880 --> 40:01.280
about the commentary community.

40:01.280 --> 40:05.440
What this tells us about Matt is that going into the controversy, he was familiar with

40:05.440 --> 40:07.440
the YouTubers he was screwing over.

40:07.440 --> 40:12.000
And surprise surprise, most of them are associated with the anti-SJW rabbit hole.

40:12.000 --> 40:15.760
Many have interpreted Matt as simply not understanding the collateral damage he was going to cause.

40:15.760 --> 40:20.040
But since he's acknowledged both their past and present influence, he can't claim

40:20.040 --> 40:21.040
ignorance.

40:21.040 --> 40:24.480
And this, by proxy, sheds a doubt on his stated motivations.

40:24.480 --> 40:28.840
It's now entirely plausible that he could have been concern trolling, inciting a PR

40:28.840 --> 40:33.760
disaster under false pretenses to undercut the financial earnings of propagandists.

40:33.760 --> 40:37.240
And then, after it was all said and done, he could sit back and laugh as they've all

40:37.240 --> 40:42.520
been relegated to becoming Uber drivers.

40:42.520 --> 40:46.080
Money at his post from before the controversy revealed that it was Jordan Peterson that

40:46.080 --> 40:49.080
led him to broaden his focus from just the manosphere.

40:49.080 --> 40:55.000
Sometimes it feels like the f***ing manosphere anti-SJW types permeate every corner of YouTube.

40:55.000 --> 40:59.040
It seems like no matter what video I watch, the comments are infected with angry s***lords

40:59.040 --> 41:03.600
whining about feminism, liberals, and or whatever minority group they can scapegoat for the

41:03.600 --> 41:04.600
world's woes.

41:04.600 --> 41:06.440
It's f***ing depressing.

41:06.440 --> 41:10.040
At this point, it's worth clarifying that if all this is true, Matt had an extremely

41:10.040 --> 41:11.320
flawed plan.

41:11.320 --> 41:16.400
By broadly attacking all content creators, he skewered not just right-wingers, but LGBT

41:16.400 --> 41:17.800
creators and leftists.

41:17.800 --> 41:21.880
Remember, YouTube is a platform where pretty much anyone can upload videos.

41:21.880 --> 41:26.560
This makes it an invaluable tool for financially unstable people to have a voice.

41:26.560 --> 41:30.440
As YouTube becomes less sustainable as a job, the people being affected the most are the

41:30.440 --> 41:32.440
ones who can't afford to do it anymore.

41:32.440 --> 41:36.320
If Matt's intention was to combat right-wing pundits, the best way to avoid this collateral

41:36.320 --> 41:38.840
damage would have been to fight them using the algorithm.

41:38.880 --> 41:43.040
Instead, he chose to do the more woke thing of pandering to millionaire ad agencies.

41:43.040 --> 41:47.120
But with all that said, the uncertainty of this theory and his general incompetence makes

41:47.120 --> 41:48.640
it impossible to confirm.

41:48.640 --> 41:52.560
Sure, he was celebrating his victory after the fact, but he always stopped short of saying

41:52.560 --> 41:53.560
he did it intentionally.

41:53.560 --> 41:56.840
And it's not like he wasn't aware of the leftists he was going to hurt.

41:56.840 --> 42:00.920
Prior to the controversy, he'd advised an aspiring left-wing creator to only do it for

42:00.920 --> 42:03.240
fun, because it didn't pay like it used to.

42:03.240 --> 42:06.920
And throughout all his messages, despite posting in a leftist community, he never seems to

42:06.920 --> 42:08.520
talk about class.

42:08.520 --> 42:13.280
So maybe it's possible that Matt wasn't motivated by feelings of class solidarity.

42:13.280 --> 42:16.960
Maybe he did have ulterior motives, but ones that were even more covert than his Reddit

42:16.960 --> 42:18.280
account let on.

42:18.280 --> 42:22.600
What if Matt Watson wasn't trying to be a proletariat hero, but instead the exact

42:22.600 --> 42:24.760
opposite, a corporate shill?

42:30.200 --> 42:34.320
One of the strangest aspects about Matt that has thus far gone unexplained is the lack

42:34.320 --> 42:37.560
of any substantial information about his identity.

42:37.600 --> 42:42.160
Aside from those who deliberately remain anonymous, nearly all leaders of social movements have

42:42.160 --> 42:46.420
some sort of paper trail that reveal aspects about their personal lives.

42:46.420 --> 42:49.740
As far as we know, Matt Watson is a blank slate.

42:49.740 --> 42:54.180
How can this be the case for someone who spent days openly broadcasting his name and face

42:54.180 --> 42:56.120
for the whole world to see?

42:56.120 --> 42:59.960
Throughout all this exposure, you'd think that at least one YouTuber or one Redditor

42:59.960 --> 43:05.140
or one newsreader would know the guy in person and be able to divulge any sort of details

43:05.140 --> 43:06.720
about his identity.

43:06.720 --> 43:11.520
All this seems extraordinarily bizarre until you consider the possibility that Matt Watson,

43:11.520 --> 43:14.400
as we know him, doesn't actually exist.

43:14.400 --> 43:19.720
Each spring, media companies and advertisers hold annual meetings called Upfronts.

43:19.720 --> 43:23.900
Upfronts were originally used by television networks to partition and sell commercial

43:23.900 --> 43:26.440
time for brands to market their products.

43:26.440 --> 43:31.240
Eventually, Upfronts expanded to the digital space, and companies now use these meetings

43:31.240 --> 43:34.880
to determine their online marketing budget for the upcoming year.

43:34.880 --> 43:39.280
YouTube has typically hosted their Upfront in the first week of May, but Upfront negotiations

43:39.280 --> 43:42.580
across all networks span into the beginning of March.

43:42.580 --> 43:46.980
This time frame is significant to our theory because it indicates that brands must outline

43:46.980 --> 43:51.180
their tentative advertising budgets by the end of February, the time period that just

43:51.180 --> 43:54.000
so happens to align with YouTube Wake Up.

43:54.000 --> 43:57.720
It also happens to align with another infamous YouTube controversy.

43:57.720 --> 44:03.140
In February 2017, Wall Street Journal reporter Jack Nikas would co-publish an article accusing

44:03.140 --> 44:05.500
PewDiePie of antisemitism.

44:05.500 --> 44:10.340
Much like Matt Watson's campaign, the Wall Street Journal seemingly manufactured a controversy

44:10.340 --> 44:11.740
out of thin air.

44:11.740 --> 44:16.340
Much like Matt's video, the article was manipulative and deceptive, and also featured

44:16.340 --> 44:21.540
a strange emphasis on advertisers as well as YouTube's supposed responsibility to

44:21.540 --> 44:23.700
micromanage its creators.

44:23.700 --> 44:28.900
One month later, Jack Nikas would target advertisers head-on by using a singular screenshot to

44:28.900 --> 44:32.000
accuse YouTube of running ads on racist content.

44:32.000 --> 44:37.220
He would curiously omit a key detail that the video was monetized not by the uploader,

44:37.220 --> 44:39.440
but by a music copyright claim.

44:39.440 --> 44:43.960
Rather than blame the music companies, who frequently operate above the law on YouTube,

44:43.960 --> 44:49.040
Nikas would instead blame YouTube itself and instigate the first adpocalypse.

44:49.040 --> 44:53.360
In the following months, YouTube would implement sweeping changes to the revenue system on

44:53.360 --> 44:58.920
the site, most notably mass demonetization, introduction of the hidden channel rating

44:58.920 --> 45:02.240
volume, and the subsequent suppression of edgy content.

45:02.240 --> 45:06.260
A tremendous impact, all from a single misleading article.

45:06.260 --> 45:10.440
If you're noticing a pattern here, it's probably that springtime on YouTube is starting

45:10.440 --> 45:15.200
to bring a vigorous bloom of dubious controversy and advertiser boycotts.

45:15.200 --> 45:18.480
Do you think it's possible that these two prickly plants may have sprouted from the

45:18.480 --> 45:19.920
same seed?

45:19.920 --> 45:24.040
It's possible that Matt Watson was no ordinary garden variety plant.

45:24.040 --> 45:28.640
He may very well have been an industry plant, a fulcrum through which brands attempted to

45:28.640 --> 45:31.200
leverage cheaper ad rates on YouTube.

45:31.200 --> 45:35.840
The entire ad boycott was just a smokescreen for companies to renegotiate their existing

45:35.840 --> 45:39.520
contracts with YouTube and return at a lower rate.

45:39.520 --> 45:45.000
At the time of the YouTube wake-up controversy, many companies had ample incentive to do so.

45:45.000 --> 45:49.560
Ever since the first adpocalypse, YouTube had been secretly subsidizing numerous brand

45:49.560 --> 45:54.440
safety agencies, third-party companies who worked with major corporate clients to ensure

45:54.440 --> 45:58.200
that their ads would not appear alongside questionable content.

45:58.200 --> 46:02.760
In hopes of enticing major brands back to the platform, YouTube essentially refunded

46:02.760 --> 46:07.480
the charges of these third-party services so brands could access them for free.

46:07.480 --> 46:12.160
At the end of 2018, YouTube disclosed that they would no longer be footing the bill and

46:12.160 --> 46:16.560
that advertisers would now have to pay for brand safety services on their own.

46:16.560 --> 46:21.360
This announcement frustrated both the third-party services and their clients, who now both faced

46:21.360 --> 46:24.040
unexpected budgetary complications.

46:24.040 --> 46:27.740
You have to imagine that heading into the new year, some of them were looking to recoup

46:27.740 --> 46:29.080
their losses.

46:29.080 --> 46:33.640
On February 6th, Business Insider published an article revealing that YouTube was no longer

46:33.640 --> 46:36.380
subsidizing brand safety agencies.

46:36.380 --> 46:41.420
Just 11 days later, Matt Watson would initiate the YouTube wake-up controversy while heavily

46:41.420 --> 46:44.560
emphasizing that YouTube is unsafe for brands.

46:44.560 --> 46:47.780
But I have multiple examples of big-name brands.

46:47.780 --> 46:50.900
We're talking Dodge Ram, Disney in one video.

46:50.900 --> 46:56.600
I can't imagine what these brands are going to say about their content appearing on these

46:56.600 --> 46:57.600
kinds of videos.

46:57.600 --> 46:59.240
Think about the consequences of this.

46:59.240 --> 47:01.300
You have a Disney advert.

47:01.300 --> 47:07.640
You have a McDonald's advert appearing on a video where a creep is time-stamping a little

47:07.640 --> 47:08.640
girl.

47:08.640 --> 47:14.120
If news outlets start reporting this and brands like McDonald's find out that their advertising

47:14.120 --> 47:22.360
is appearing on these videos, YouTube will do something.

47:22.360 --> 47:26.080
There's no denying that these companies have incredible reach and influence.

47:26.560 --> 47:30.160
The Amazon slate was notably partnered with GroupM, the largest advertising company in

47:30.160 --> 47:34.840
the world, and one that claims to be responsible for a third of all ads broadcasted.

47:34.840 --> 47:39.080
They certainly have the means to pull some strings in the mainstream media, especially

47:39.080 --> 47:43.580
in an age where news outlets have been revealed to be increasingly corrupt.

47:43.580 --> 47:48.340
These days, most news agendas are determined not by what's newsworthy, but by what's profitable

47:48.340 --> 47:53.760
for those running the show, and YouTube wake-up sought to make many companies a lot of money.

47:53.760 --> 47:57.440
This theory explains how Matt's campaign got so much coverage.

47:57.440 --> 48:01.440
The brands had always been planning to pull out, they just needed an angry activist to

48:01.440 --> 48:03.520
provide them with the opportunity.

48:03.520 --> 48:07.000
It's possible that the key to solving the mystery of Matt Watson may have been hiding

48:07.000 --> 48:09.200
in plain sight this whole time.

48:09.200 --> 48:13.720
This whole thing was never about protecting kids, some brands even admitted it.

48:13.720 --> 48:17.680
Practically all of them eventually returned to YouTube, likely at a cheaper rate than

48:17.680 --> 48:18.800
before.

48:18.800 --> 48:24.800
As for Matt, well, as far as we know, his entire channel, story, and persona is a fabrication.

48:24.800 --> 48:29.320
The reason we can't find anything on his identity is that Matt Watson, as we know him, doesn't

48:29.320 --> 48:30.680
actually exist.

48:30.680 --> 48:35.600
Matt Watson was just the alias of a covert agent, hired to do a very specific job by

48:35.600 --> 48:37.280
an unknown entity.

48:37.280 --> 48:41.320
Once he accomplished his mission, he no longer had any reason to stick around.

48:41.320 --> 48:46.920
Uh, in the description, I've included all the social media contact information for every

48:46.920 --> 48:53.400
brand that appears in my video, and I've included a timestamp for where exactly that

48:53.400 --> 48:54.880
brand appears in my video.

48:54.880 --> 49:00.520
Uh, in the description, I've included all the social media contact information for every

49:00.520 --> 49:07.400
brand.

49:07.400 --> 49:12.480
Of course, like the other theories, the industry plant hypothesis doesn't account for everything.

49:12.480 --> 49:17.200
If Matt really was a hired agent, then how could you explain his older content?

49:17.200 --> 49:21.280
It seems rather ridiculous to suggest that he was planning this stunt for more than two

49:21.280 --> 49:22.280
years.

49:22.280 --> 49:26.900
If the advertisers needed an unsuspecting plant to orchestrate a controversy, then why

49:26.900 --> 49:31.860
select one with any sort of history attached to his account, especially one with history

49:31.860 --> 49:34.280
as bizarre as Matt's old content?

49:34.280 --> 49:39.280
Additionally, as with any conspiracy containing a ton of moving parts, this theory potentially

49:39.280 --> 49:42.400
involves a lot of people that would need to be kept quiet.

49:42.400 --> 49:47.280
And finally, if it was really that easy for companies to take advantage of YouTube, shouldn't

49:47.280 --> 49:51.080
we have seen a bunch of Matt Watsons popping up all over the place?

49:51.080 --> 49:58.080
At least for now, that remains to be seen.

49:58.080 --> 50:07.920
Unfortunately, we may never know Matt Watson's true intentions with the YouTube Wake Up campaign.

50:07.920 --> 50:12.080
At the end of the day, all of our theories are nothing more than educated guesses and

50:12.080 --> 50:16.760
unless we get some serious testimony from any of the parties involved, all we can do

50:16.760 --> 50:18.400
is wonder.

50:18.400 --> 50:23.140
Speculation aside, it is fairly evident from the facts of the case that we should be skeptical

50:23.140 --> 50:26.680
of Matt Watson's self-proclaimed mission to protect children.

50:26.680 --> 50:30.800
The circumstances surrounding his behavior were too suspicious and contradictory for

50:30.800 --> 50:33.200
us to buy into the official narrative.

50:33.200 --> 50:38.120
It's obvious that Matt had some hidden agenda, but what exactly that agenda was may forever

50:38.120 --> 50:39.800
remain up for debate.

50:39.800 --> 50:43.360
One thing for certain is that the fulfillment of Matt's agenda came at the expense of

50:43.360 --> 50:45.740
both YouTube and its creators.

50:45.740 --> 50:50.480
The meteoric success of YouTube Wake Up may be indicative of changing tides in the digital

50:50.480 --> 50:51.520
landscape.

50:51.520 --> 50:55.720
The controversy likely represents one of the mounting consequences of YouTube's de facto

50:55.720 --> 50:59.220
monopoly on long-form user-generated content.

50:59.220 --> 51:03.580
As the site continues to scale beyond the limits of human control, the platform will

51:03.580 --> 51:06.660
keep finding itself in more precarious positions.

51:06.660 --> 51:10.260
These days it's more than just creators who are growing increasingly frustrated by

51:10.260 --> 51:11.900
their lack of options.

51:11.900 --> 51:16.300
With billions in corporate transactions on the line, YouTube is under more pressure than

51:16.300 --> 51:18.760
ever to perform to a certain standard.

51:18.760 --> 51:23.340
In the future, YouTube may further transform into a battleground between clashing corporate

51:23.340 --> 51:27.100
titans while the rest of us are just along for the ride.

51:27.100 --> 51:31.700
Ultimately, Matt Watson exposed YouTube's most confounding issue of all.

51:31.700 --> 51:35.380
Not their lack of child safety, but their lack of communication.

51:35.380 --> 51:39.740
Perhaps the biggest factor that made YouTube Wake Up so successful was YouTube's complete

51:39.740 --> 51:44.140
failure to inform the public on hardly anything happening on the platform.

51:44.140 --> 51:48.220
YouTube is a site that likes to shroud itself in a cloud of mystery so that they can operate

51:48.220 --> 51:51.080
invisibly to the prying public eye.

51:51.080 --> 51:55.560
They thrive within an information vacuum, leaving the general public totally ignorant

51:55.560 --> 51:58.300
to even the site's most basic features.

51:58.300 --> 52:03.240
It was this ignorance which Matt Watson exploited to transform a simple expose into one of the

52:03.240 --> 52:06.200
biggest controversies the site had ever seen.

52:06.200 --> 52:10.800
His blatant dishonesty should have been immediately debunked, yet it was only detected by the

52:10.800 --> 52:13.360
most savvy creators on the platform.

52:13.360 --> 52:18.520
The vast majority of observers accepted Matt's emotionally charged rhetoric as the truth,

52:18.520 --> 52:20.760
and YouTube paid the price.

52:20.760 --> 52:22.240
Honesty is a two-way street.

52:22.240 --> 52:26.360
The more you hide from the public, the less likely they are to trust you.

52:26.360 --> 52:32.280
After burning so many of us for so long, it's hard for anybody to trust YouTube these days.

52:32.280 --> 52:36.800
YouTube Wake Up serves as the ultimate indictment to the site's severe transparency issue.

52:36.800 --> 52:41.440
It also serves as an indictment against the site's total lack of direction or leadership.

52:41.440 --> 52:45.780
It's safe to say that over the past half-decade, YouTube's internal decision-making can only

52:45.780 --> 52:47.600
be described as hapless.

52:47.600 --> 52:52.000
Whether it's their persistently baffling and unwanted policy changes, their totally

52:52.000 --> 52:56.340
inconsistent enforcement of the rules, or their preferential treatment for the vapid

52:56.340 --> 53:01.360
celebrities at the top of the site, many of YouTube's issues are completely self-imposed,

53:01.360 --> 53:05.520
brought about mostly by their inability to think proactively about future obstacles.

53:05.520 --> 53:09.920
Lately, the direction of the site seems about as coherent as a headless chicken, like how

53:09.920 --> 53:14.560
YouTube has spent the past five years dedicating an entire section of the site to kindergartners

53:14.560 --> 53:20.320
only to scramble and panic when, shockingly, targeting them with ads was against the law.

53:20.320 --> 53:24.460
Much of YouTube's aimlessness could be attributed to their pitifully weak leadership.

53:24.460 --> 53:29.000
In the event of a crisis like the Matt Watson controversy, most YouTubers have nowhere to

53:29.000 --> 53:30.880
turn for news and guidance.

53:30.880 --> 53:34.880
Who is supposed to be YouTube's spokesperson in situations like these?

53:34.880 --> 53:37.640
The anonymous Team YouTube Twitter account?

53:37.640 --> 53:40.680
Susan with her bi-annual blog posts?

53:40.680 --> 53:45.880
How is it that a guy like Matt Watson, a single angry dude in his bedroom, is a more effective

53:45.880 --> 53:49.120
leader and communicator than anyone at YouTube?

53:49.120 --> 53:53.280
YouTube Wake Up once again proves that unless the platform makes some major changes in their

53:53.280 --> 53:57.280
management, they will continue to get eaten alive by companies who know they can get away

53:57.280 --> 53:58.280
with it.

53:58.280 --> 54:02.820
Until YouTube's administration can learn to effectively communicate its goals and solutions

54:02.820 --> 54:07.480
to the greater public, cowardly decision-making will continue to threaten the stability of

54:07.480 --> 54:08.480
the site.

54:08.480 --> 54:13.040
In the future, we may either look back on Matt Watson as an anomaly or as the beginning

54:13.040 --> 54:15.240
of a far more sinister trend.

54:15.240 --> 54:19.280
I'm sure that every creator would hope that controversies like YouTube Wake Up remain

54:19.280 --> 54:20.640
in the past.

54:20.640 --> 54:25.640
Matt Watson sparked a wave of rage and disgust by supposedly uncovering a wormhole.

54:25.640 --> 54:29.880
Nobody realized that the real wormhole would be the mystery behind Matt himself.

54:29.880 --> 54:34.640
Whoever he was and whatever he was doing here, Matt Watson will go down as YouTube's most

54:34.640 --> 54:35.920
infamous red herring.

55:15.240 --> 55:24.720
Thanks for watching.
