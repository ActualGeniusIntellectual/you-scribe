0	22680	In the waning hours of February 17th, 2019, a YouTuber under the alias of Matt's What
22680	27180	It Is uploaded a video that would send shockwaves across the entire site.
27180	31720	By morning, the video would reach the front page of Reddit, accumulating millions of views
31720	32900	on YouTube.
32900	36980	All of a sudden, waves of outrage inundate every corner of the web.
36980	41800	YouTube now faces ferocious controversy over Matt's allegations that the platform is willfully
41800	44720	harboring child predators.
44720	49260	YouTube reacts swiftly by deactivating the comment sections of thousands of child-oriented
49260	50480	channels.
50480	55220	Their efforts to subdue the mounting outrage would prove futile, as the controversy was
55220	57560	now spiraling out of control.
57560	63020	Over the next five days, no fewer than 70 articles report on YouTube's child-endangerment
63020	64020	problem.
64020	67980	At around the same time, companies begin pulling their ads.
67980	74160	McDonald's, Disney, Nestle, AT&T, Epic Games, some of YouTube's biggest corporate partners
74160	76040	withdraw their funding.
76040	81700	Ad rates falter site-wide, YouTubers scramble for answers, the whole platform is tumbling
81700	87140	down a spiral of outraged parents, ravenous reporters, and terrified advertisers, all
87140	89940	led by a single red-haired stranger.
89940	94700	Then, just as quickly as he appeared, he vanished, never to return.
94700	116220	Now, more than a year afterwards, we are only just beginning to pick up the pieces.
116220	121460	First we have to talk about the man behind the mayhem, Matt Watson, a common, ordinary
121460	123900	name for a common, ordinary man.
123900	128020	You see, the best thing about being ordinary is that it's really easy to blend in with
128020	129580	the rest of the crowd.
129580	134360	And in the YouTube community, nobody had any idea who Matt Watson was.
134360	138900	No one had any contact with him on Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, Discord.
138900	141420	The guy was a total outsider.
141420	145920	Simple online searches for the stranger revealed a few other past social media accounts with
145920	147600	limited information.
147600	152020	The most substantial discovery would be his former YouTube channel, a channel that housed
152020	154580	some rather strange videos.
154580	160060	But all things considered, Matt's old videos only raised more questions than they answered.
160060	164860	Ultimately, they provided no further details about his identity, occupation, or greater
164860	166680	purpose on the platform.
166680	171380	When the time came, he stormed into YouTube as an army of one, but prepared to recruit
171380	180540	many others to his cause.
180540	186460	And wake up, the brick in the window that started the riot, ground zero of YouTube's
186460	191420	worst meltdown yet, a video that left many of its viewers red in the face and ready to
191420	197140	burn the site to the ground.
197140	202100	But amidst the anger, chaos, and disgust, many lost sight of whether the video was actually
202100	203100	accurate.
203100	206020	At a glance, Matt's efforts seemed noble enough.
206020	210720	Child predation is a universally scorned activity, and Matt was doing his civic duty
210720	214460	by alerting the greater public of a rather egregious example.
214460	219540	The issues of Matt's video and his subsequent livestreams stem from his odd mischaracterizations
219540	222820	of YouTube and the YouTube community as a whole.
222820	226780	Several of the implications in the video range from deceptive to outright lies about the
226780	228860	platform and its creators.
228860	233220	To the average layman, the video may have seemed perfectly fine, but to seasoned YouTube
233220	236940	veterans, these issues became a lot more apparent.
236940	241660	First and foremost, the video is predicated entirely on the point that YouTube is facilitating
241660	246700	a rabbit hole of content that connects bad actors with unsuspecting children and each
246700	259940	other.
259940	264140	The way Matt presents this, the audience is left to assume that YouTube is either grossly
264140	269740	negligent, or worse, intentionally aiding child exploitation on the platform.
269740	273580	And while YouTubers certainly know saints in this regard, specifically highlighting
273580	278540	these videos and comments as a wormhole of scum and villainy is deceptive because it
278540	283260	overlooks the fundamental directive of the general video recommendation algorithm on
283260	284260	YouTube.
284260	288260	Once you enter into this wormhole for whatever reason, YouTube's algorithm is glitching
288260	292740	out to a point that nothing but these videos exist.
292740	298160	If you look up any category of video on YouTube, the algorithm will recommend you more videos
298160	299380	like it.
299380	307300	This applies to cartoons, basketball, mukbang, ASMR, wasp removal videos, anything you enjoy
307300	308300	watching.
308300	312980	It's the algorithm's job to indiscriminately serve you more videos that will keep you on
312980	313980	the site.
313980	316300	The key word being indiscriminate.
316340	318860	The algorithm doesn't know morality.
318860	323160	Its job is not to tell you if what you're watching is ethically wrong.
323160	328340	Its only purpose is to deduce what you like watching and give you more of it.
328340	332260	The problem with Matt's video is that he presents an incredibly myopic view of the
332260	344220	algorithm by highlighting only its capacity for abuse by bad actors.
344220	350340	A deeper dive into YouTube will reveal a variety of dark, disturbing, and macabre wormholes.
350340	355020	YouTube is not facilitating the abuse of baby monkeys for example.
355020	360140	These wormholes only exist because of the strange users who inhabit them.
360140	364660	It is the people who abuse this framework that create the wormhole.
364660	369400	YouTube only provides the framework and expecting them to manually patrol the activities of
369400	372940	billions of independent users is simply impossible.
372940	375660	But therein lies the issue with Matt's video.
375660	380060	Matt portrays the wormhole as if it's YouTube's direct responsibility.
380060	384980	Matt implies it's YouTube's fault that predators are on the platform and therefore
384980	393980	that YouTube deserves to be punished.
393980	399500	Is it really YouTube's fault that unsupervised children ignore YouTube's minimum age requirement
399500	401740	to upload videos of themselves?
401740	406260	Is it YouTube's fault that foolish parents post videos of their children to a public
406260	412580	platform for the whole world to see?
412580	416760	Are we supposed to expect YouTube to moderate the comment sections of each and every video
416760	421220	as if the individual uploaders are unable to do so themselves?
421220	425940	YouTube has made its fair share of missteps in its handling of children on the platform,
425940	431100	many of which I have personally criticized before, but in this video Matt heavily implies
431100	435500	that YouTube is totally indifferent towards child endangerment and that they essentially
435500	451020	allow predators to have a field day on the platform.
451020	455420	This is a blatantly false narrative and can be disproven using events that happened the
455420	458460	very week before Matt uploaded his video.
458460	463360	The week of February 15th, multiple channels were terminated by YouTube without warning.
463360	467620	They would later find out that they were unjust victims of a new YouTube initiative to remove
467620	469940	videos with CP in the title.
469940	474180	It just so happens that in this case, they forgot to whitelist videos about Club Penguin
474180	476720	and Pokemon Go combat points.
476720	479180	Was YouTube's decision clumsy and misguided?
479180	483940	Yes, absolutely, but to claim that YouTube isn't trying to combat child endangerment
483940	486380	on the platform is simply dishonest.
486380	493560	This would pop up, this would load, and you would see that there was some sort of unusual
493560	497400	behavior going on here and there's some sort of glitch in the algorithm.
497400	501900	Not only does Matt mislead the audience about YouTube's efforts, he then goes on to misrepresent
501900	504120	the entire YouTube community.
504120	509740	Matt ends his expose with a montage of YouTubers complaining about demonetization, which is
509740	515740	intended to paint YouTubers as self-centered and oblivious to the real problem on the platform.
515740	519920	When confronted about his questionable claims on his subsequent live streams, Matt would
519920	524620	get very defensive and often retort with the claim that YouTubers are purposely ignoring
524620	529180	child endangerment because they are motivated only by their own selfish greed.
529180	531520	That is literally your perspective.
531520	533460	Your perspective is monetization.
533460	537180	Frankly, they probably don't want to admit it, but they care more about money than they
537180	543160	do about the fact that there's an easily exploitable ring of creepy child videos on YouTube.
543160	545500	They care more about money.
545500	548540	When I say they, I'm not talking about YouTube, I'm talking about these fucking YouTubers
548540	550040	who are salty as fuck.
550040	551040	Just admit it.
551040	552040	You're salty.
552040	556480	This was an oddly ignorant and divisive stance considering that many high profile channels
556480	560860	have dedicated videos to combating child endangerment on the platform.
560860	565620	Channels like Nerd City, H3H3, PewDiePie, and Pyrocynical have all exposed predatory
565620	566620	content.
566620	571580	Pyrocynical actually led to an entire wing of abusive content getting shut down.
571580	576540	Paradoxically, Matt seems ignorant of this fact, yet he includes many of these same channels
576540	581560	in his video while simultaneously shaming them for not caring about the issue.
581560	584060	So does Matt watch these channels or not?
584060	589260	Does he only pay attention to them specifically when they're complaining about getting demonetized?
589260	594700	Matt's confrontational view of the YouTube community is so baffling that it becomes suspicious.
594700	599020	What would Matt have to gain by throwing the entire YouTube community under the bus?
599020	603700	I thought the issue here is child endangerment, which many YouTubers agree is a huge issue
603700	605180	on the platform.
605180	607960	Why would you not want them on your side?
607960	612460	This doesn't make any sense, unless of course you believe that Matt Watson had a different
612460	613660	motive in mind.
621820	625260	And I'm not one of these people that says, oh get a real job.
625260	626980	Being a YouTuber isn't a real job.
626980	628380	I don't think that at all.
628380	629980	20 minutes later.
629980	632140	You know, oh my monetization, bro.
632140	634180	Yeah, there you go.
634180	635620	Get a part-time job.
635620	638420	Uber, Uber looks good for you.
638420	643540	Matt Watson's demonstrable lies, deception, and dishonesty should confirm him as an unreliable
643540	644540	narrator.
644540	649420	His dubious behavior reeks of someone with a hidden agenda, an agenda which becomes more
649420	653260	obvious with Matt's call to action in his exposé.
653260	657300	I hope with the video evidence that I have that more people find out about adverts being
657300	662780	played on videos like this, and that YouTube shits the bed ten times worse than they did
662780	664460	in 2017.
664460	670500	Matt's plan to protect children on YouTube is to incite a mass boycott of YouTube's advertisers.
670500	672740	Guys, please contact them.
672740	674940	Trust me, these companies care.
674940	676020	People care.
676020	679100	Don't worry, if this sounds ludicrous to you, you're correct.
679100	683100	But it kind of makes sense if you're all riled up and bash your head against the wall a few
683100	684900	times.
684900	690020	Matt's rationale is to force YouTube to protect kids by hitting them where it hurts, in their
690020	691020	wallets.
691020	693940	Because remember, the only time that YouTube is going to do something is when it starts
693940	698060	to hit their pocket, when it starts to hit their wallet.
698060	702860	And the only way to get them to respond is through their wallet, and the only way to
702860	707440	hit Google and hit YouTube is where it hurts, in their wallet.
707440	712100	Never mind the point that YouTube is already making an effort to stop predators, Matt is
712100	716780	suggesting that hundreds of thousands of YouTube creators across the entire site lose
716780	722420	revenue because of a few unmoderated comment sections completely out of their control.
722420	727500	Matt is suggesting that rather than flagging and reporting the abusive videos, we take
727500	734020	money away from innocent creators so that YouTube will flag and report abusive videos.
734020	738660	If you're not quite up to speed on how YouTube ads work, companies pay YouTube every time
738660	742600	one of their ads gets placed on a video, and the revenue then gets split between the
742600	744740	creator and the platform.
744740	748240	YouTube and its creators exist in a symbiotic relationship.
748240	752980	This is the primary reason why inciting ad boycotts makes no sense.
752980	757100	Because to stab at the heart of YouTube, you must first drive the blade through thousands
757100	758900	of innocent channels.
758900	765080	Even if YouTube took 100% of the revenue, Matt's plan would still be totally nonsensical.
765080	770160	YouTube is one of the few massive websites that is not publicly traded on any stock exchange.
770160	775360	As I mentioned in previous videos, no one knows whether YouTube is even profitable.
775360	780120	It's clear at this point that Google does not keep YouTube running as a lucrative venture.
780120	784760	They support YouTube because of its enormous market share in online video.
784760	789240	What YouTube lacks in profit, it more than makes up for in influence.
789240	793440	YouTube itself may not bring in the big bucks for Google, but what it does bring in is the
793440	795080	customers who will.
795080	799500	For this reason, YouTube will likely never have to worry about financial woes as long
799500	805680	as Google stays in business, which is why advertiser boycotts hold no actual leverage.
805680	810440	Every time this happens, the platform gets impacted far less than the creators, who don't
810440	813640	have the financial padding of a trillion dollar company.
813640	818900	At some point, it seemed that Matt cared more about punishing YouTubers than punishing predators.
818900	823840	He demonstrated this with his repeated insistence that any YouTuber who disagreed with inciting
823840	828460	an ad boycott was greedy.
828460	833060	When YouTubers like Nerd City attempted to reason with Matt on these issues, he responded
833060	834780	with total belligerence.
834780	837920	The community was on his side for the first few days.
837920	841820	People were sharing the video, we were stopping by his chat and saying like, you know, how
841820	842820	can we help?
842820	844100	Thank you for what you did.
844100	845340	Nerd City is here.
845340	846340	Okay.
846340	847340	Who's Nerd City?
847340	848740	I got to look all these people up.
848740	853660	People like myself and Leon Lush and Keemstar were reaching out to him and saying, hey man,
853660	855060	we're on the same page here.
855060	861220	What you found is a problem and YouTube needs to address it, but pump the brakes on the
861220	862740	contacting advertisers.
862740	864300	That is not going to solve the problem.
864820	867460	It's just going to injure YouTube, like potentially fatally.
867460	871780	Matt just kept dismissing anything that YouTubers were saying to him about like, don't contact
871780	872780	advertisers.
872780	873780	Like don't do this yet.
873780	875380	That's, that's the nuclear option.
875380	878300	His stubbornness started to become the problem.
878300	882700	Like he pretended he was listening and he would ask, act like, all right, man, I want
882700	883700	to talk.
883700	884700	Yeah.
884700	885700	I'd love to talk to Keemstar.
885700	888820	And he would put someone on live to talk on Discord.
888820	892580	And then once they would say something he didn't like, he just, you know, put his hands
892580	895980	over his ears and said, sorry, no, no, no, what I'm doing is right.
895980	900340	And you're just greedy and YouTube is going to have to suffer for this.
900340	903700	This means that YouTubers are going to suffer, unfortunately.
903700	908980	The only way to get YouTube to do something about this is to hit them where it hurts.
908980	910700	And that's in their wallet.
910700	914980	There was never a point when Matt elaborated on how his plan was more effective than just
914980	917260	manually reporting the predators.
917260	922420	The rhetoric in his streams was akin to that of a political rally, featuring lots of sloganeering,
922420	924460	dogmatic statements and emotional appeal.
924460	927340	I mean, this is disgusting, disgusting comment.
927340	928340	I'm disgusted.
928340	929340	I'm disgusted.
929340	930340	I'm angry.
930340	931340	How does this exist?
931340	933340	That's all I have to say.
933340	934340	Disgusted.
934340	936020	I've been more emotional in this video that I've wanted to be.
936020	938560	I wanted to be more collected and calm.
938560	943620	Matt used his stream almost exclusively as a way to galvanize his audience into contacting
943620	944940	brands.
944940	949540	At times, it felt like pressuring advertisers to pull their funding was the only thing Matt
949540	951540	cared about.
951540	954260	Oh, yes, man.
954260	955260	Yes.
955260	962500	Dude, that's what I'm talking about.
962500	964500	We did it.
964500	966480	Thanks for bringing it to our attention, Jamie.
966480	969900	Our team is aware and investigating this material.
969900	973000	It's good.
973000	977440	Now at this point, some of you may be starting to realize that Matt Watson wasn't quite the
977440	980500	noble vigilante that he originally appeared to be.
980500	991700	Unfortunately for YouTube, too many people were unable to see through the illusion.
991700	996480	The public outrage sparked by Matt's video was astounding, to say the least.
996480	1001080	By morning, it had skyrocketed to the top of our videos, becoming one of the most widely
1001080	1003680	shared videos in the history of the site.
1003680	1008760	Within a week of its upload, more than 70 news articles had reported on the controversy,
1008760	1012000	with most directly linking Matt's video to readers.
1012000	1016380	With all this considered, Matt Watson had single-handedly incited possibly the most
1016380	1019680	circulated controversy in the history of YouTube.
1019680	1024680	In terms of initial media coverage, only Logan Paul's most infamous controversy was comparable
1024680	1026140	in scale.
1026140	1030540	Matt's video was reported on so extensively that it raises the question of how exactly
1030540	1032280	it spread so far.
1032280	1036620	As I mentioned previously, many high-profile YouTubers have covered the issue of child
1036620	1040920	endangerment before, yet they hardly received any mainstream coverage.
1040920	1045960	If you want to compare apples to apples, in 2018 a French YouTuber with hundreds of thousands
1045960	1050520	of followers uploaded a video covering the same topic as Matt, with coincidentally the
1050520	1052520	exact same hashtag.
1052520	1056840	Why didn't this video spawn 70 articles or hit the front page of Reddit?
1056840	1058440	What made Matt's video different?
1058440	1063140	Well, aside from the language barrier, it's highly likely that Matt Watson employed some
1063140	1067080	rather sneaky tactics to nudge his video in the right direction.
1067080	1072400	Matt published his video at 11.27 PM Eastern Time, which is very late in the evening by
1072400	1074080	YouTube standards.
1074080	1078520	Most YouTubers choose to upload in the afternoon or early evening so they can capitalize off
1078520	1080360	peak internet traffic.
1080360	1085000	Matt deliberately published his video after most people had gone to sleep, a poor strategy
1085000	1090300	for YouTube views, but a necessary strategy for what he likely had planned.
1090300	1095280	Only 40 minutes after Matt published his video on YouTube, he posted the link to Reddit.
1095280	1099280	About 90 minutes after that, he begins live streaming on his YouTube channel where he
1099280	1102640	links his viewers to the Reddit post so that they can upvote it.
1102640	1104120	Link in the chat will upvote them.
1104120	1105120	Yeah, that's a good idea.
1105120	1106120	Actually, you know what?
1106120	1107120	I'm going to stay on the chat right now.
1107120	1108440	Okay guys, it's up.
1108440	1117240	So I'm going to post the link over here in the window, post, that's my post.
1117240	1119800	So yeah, upvote that all you can.
1119800	1124340	This is a strict violation of the solicitation rule on our videos and should have led to
1124340	1125460	the post removal.
1125460	1131220	However, at around 1 AM on a weekday, most of the mods were probably asleep and the violation
1131220	1133220	went completely unnoticed.
1133220	1137800	Matt's initial karma injection was enough to push the video to the front page and after
1137800	1141220	that point, the Reddit hive mind did the rest.
1141220	1145540	Almost by design, the video was inundated by a furious wave of outsiders who had little
1145540	1148200	to no understanding of how YouTube works.
1148200	1159220	And before the YouTube community could respond, the video was already too big to fail.
1159220	1163840	The media coverage of Matt Watson's video was as dubious as any other aspect of the
1163840	1164840	controversy.
1164840	1169460	Dozens of publications jumped on a bandwagon to elevate Matt's video as if he made a ground
1169460	1170920	breaking discovery.
1170920	1174260	This issue had been discussed by YouTube commentators for years.
1174260	1177340	Why did everyone decide to get outraged by it now?
1177340	1181740	Was the word wormhole just a trigger for people to suddenly pay attention?
1181740	1186020	Last spring I was able to discuss the issue of child predation with anxiety war, who has
1186020	1189160	become the modern day Chris Hansen of YouTube.
1189160	1193500	Through his years of experience in identifying and confronting predators, he identified that
1193500	1197520	the most dangerous sites for children are instant messaging apps like Snapchat and the
1197520	1201860	now defunct Kik, which allow predators to communicate directly with children.
1201860	1222580	YouTube's direct message system was buried in the video manager for years, and in 2018
1222580	1224780	they removed the feature entirely.
1224780	1229780	Content wise, apps like Instagram and TikTok are far more dangerous for children than YouTube,
1229780	1234060	with Instagram ranked as the leading app in giving kids depression among other psychiatric
1234060	1240300	issues, and TikTok continually luring unaware kids to injure themselves in ridiculous challenges.
1240300	1244780	Both of these apps also have an easily accessible instant messaging feature which allow predators
1244780	1246840	to speak directly to minors.
1246840	1251000	As far as child endangerment goes, YouTube should be far from the top of anyone's list
1251000	1255960	of the most dangerous apps for kids, yet the media seems to treat YouTube far more harshly
1255960	1257980	than any of these other sites.
1257980	1261420	Apps like TikTok are often portrayed as fun and quirky.
1261420	1266660	You never see any outrage mobs trying to incite an ad boycott of Snapchat or Instagram.
1266660	1271260	YouTube certainly has its fair share of issues with its handling of children, but to scrutinize
1271260	1276300	them while simultaneously ignoring far more dangerous sites is either dishonest or downright
1276300	1277500	foolish.
1277500	1280800	Is this all just another case of boomers being boomers?
1280800	1285460	Maybe so, but something else about the media's coverage of Matt's video is far harder to
1285460	1286680	explain.
1286680	1292000	Out of all 73 articles written about the controversy, not one featured any interview
1292000	1293280	with Matt.
1293280	1297580	Every one of the articles either cites the video itself or a different article covering
1297580	1299080	the controversy.
1299080	1304680	Only two out of the 73 articles even mentioned reaching out to Matt for an interview.
1304680	1309200	This contradicts Matt's own claims of supposedly contacting media outlets himself.
1309200	1313900	I've written a report and I'm sending that report out to every news outlet that I possibly
1313900	1314900	can.
1314900	1320060	I get that nowadays our standards for journalistic publications are at an all-time low, but this
1320060	1321700	is just ridiculous.
1321700	1325820	Usually when reporting on a story, it's common practice to base it off some sort of
1325820	1331140	credible research from a verifiable expert in their domain, not some unknown dude who
1331140	1333100	made an angry YouTube video.
1333100	1337880	But even in the off chance that you do decide to platform a fringe weirdo with no credentials
1337880	1342660	whatsoever, you should at least be able to interview the guy and have him elaborate on
1342660	1345180	his more extraordinary claims.
1345180	1349500	Of course, most of these publications probably did reach out to Matt, which presents an even
1349500	1354020	stranger implication that Matt Watson outright refused to be interviewed.
1354020	1356500	You know, I just want to create some awareness for this.
1356500	1358940	I want to try and get this hashtag trending.
1358940	1366500	I have concealed my identity when I did it because I have emailed several news outlets,
1366500	1372660	BuzzFeed and stuff like that.
1372660	1378140	And so my concern with contacting the FBI or the police is that could someone like myself
1378140	1386440	be implicated by simply sending the information to them or the recordings to them that have
1386440	1390020	these sort of borderline thumbnails in them?
1390020	1391740	Could I be implicated in something?
1391740	1399060	So BuzzFeed, as an example, I can send something to them anonymously and they will protect
1399060	1400060	my identity.
1400060	1404340	BuzzFeed, as an example, they will protect my identity.
1404340	1408900	So I feel like by sending it to them, you know, I've started the process here.
1408900	1410740	We're talking about this stuff.
1410740	1412020	Somebody's talking about Fox News.
1412020	1413860	I don't like Fox News.
1413860	1418240	Why would the leader of a major social movement turn down the free publicity from appearing
1418240	1421460	in dozens of articles from major publications?
1421460	1425540	For someone seemingly so passionate about the issue, someone who claims to be just a
1425540	1430540	concerned citizen doing the right thing, what would he have to lose by answering a few questions
1430540	1431980	for reporters?
1431980	1435700	All I'm doing here, dude, is I'm just trying to make some awareness about this whole thing.
1435700	1437640	I'm just trying to create awareness for this.
1437640	1439380	You guys are helping to create awareness for this.
1439380	1441200	We're all creating awareness for this right now.
1441200	1445080	We have one single solitary purpose for being here right now, and that is to bring awareness
1445080	1446080	to this issue.
1446080	1447780	Hashtag YouTube wake up.
1447780	1452280	Anyone in Matt's position should have been fully cooperative with the media, unless,
1452280	1462960	of course, they had something to hide.
1462960	1467280	Another aspect of the whole situation that most people missed was Matt's inconsistent
1467280	1469840	outlook of corporate accountability.
1469840	1474500	Throughout his whole campaign, he had a remarkable ability to flip flop between a staunch opponent
1474500	1477380	of corporate abuse to an outright bootlicker.
1477380	1482100	Nestle was quick to pull their ads from YouTube amidst the controversy, despite undergoing
1482100	1486840	numerous lawsuits for using child slavery to harvest their cocoa beans.
1486840	1491760	Disney also pulled their ads over concerns of child exploitation, despite notoriously
1491760	1495960	exploiting children for years in their Chinese toy factories.
1495960	1500400	Matt Watson seemed oblivious to all of this, as he actively aided both of these companies
1500400	1503080	in his supposed mission to help children.
1503080	1506440	No matter who you are, no matter what your politics are, no matter what your skin color
1506440	1510340	is, this is about protecting children, and it's intrinsic to human nature to protect
1510340	1511340	children.
1511340	1514980	Hey pal, you just blowing from stupid town?
1514980	1519540	Eventually, pretty much all of these companies quietly returned to YouTube a few weeks after
1519540	1521700	the controversy had blown over.
1521700	1525540	Like most corporate stunts, it was all just smoke and mirrors.
1525540	1530940	So much for boycotting child exploitation, it turns out that YouTube's proverbial wallet
1530940	1536880	runs very deep, and $8,000 refunds aren't a steep price to pay when you make $15 billion
1536880	1538360	in annual revenue.
1538360	1542840	Ultimately, Matt's whole plan of forcing an ad boycott amounted to nothing more than
1542840	1546560	inconveniencing innocent creators for a few weeks.
1546560	1550900	The advertisers predictably returned, and everything went back to normal like how it
1550900	1553760	always does after any YouTube controversy.
1553760	1558720	Yet another example of why ad boycotts on YouTube make no sense whatsoever, and Matt's
1558720	1563540	whimsical double standard of corporate abuse was yet another example of his suspicious
1563540	1574240	behavior.
1574240	1578340	So let's once again visit the strange topic of Matt's old videos.
1578340	1582740	Although they were ignored by practically every major news outlet, the YouTube community
1582740	1587340	quickly gathered them as ammunition to defend the platform from his deception.
1587340	1591320	Some of you have probably seen this clip, where Matt allegedly harasses a girl on the
1591320	1597480	sidewalk.
1597480	1601920	Most YouTubers utilized this clip to reach the conclusion that Matt was an unscrupulous
1601920	1604320	creep and a failed content creator.
1604320	1609040	However, diving deeper into Matt's past content reveals that many YouTube commentators
1609040	1611640	had missed the greater context of his origins.
1611640	1615960	The few mentions of his channel in articles and forum posts reveal that Matt started on
1615960	1618660	YouTube by making Men's Health videos.
1618660	1623980	He was perhaps most known for his NoFap vlogs, which he uploaded to the Matt's What It Is
1623980	1628540	channel, the same account that would eventually host the YouTube Wake Up video and his subsequent
1628540	1629540	streams.
1629540	1632600	Matt's original account dates back to 2016.
1632600	1636900	One year later, Matt would open up a new account called Totally Uncreative, to which he would
1636900	1643740	upload what he described as comedy videos.
1643740	1648240	This is the channel that spawned Matt's more questionable content, which was later circulated
1648240	1653040	by the YouTube commentators, most of whom would assume that the content was genuine.
1653040	1657620	Matt's eventual Reddit history would contradict this theory and imply that his entire catalog
1657620	1661880	of videos on both channels were attempts at ironic satire.
1661880	1672540	I found myself kind of browsing through a lot of your old videos, you know, really got
1672540	1677100	me wondering, you know, what happened, you know, you haven't posted anything in close
1677100	1678460	to five, six months.
1678460	1683860	And I found a comment that you had pinned, I think on your most recent video that kind
1683860	1688460	of announced that, uh, that you were done, man, that you were, you were done with a whole
1688460	1692560	YouTube thing and...
1692560	1698600	Mysteriously, the old Matt's What It Is videos were archived and re-uploaded by an anonymous
1698600	1702040	channel a week after the controversy had subsided.
1702040	1706560	Although the nature or purpose of this channel is unknown, it is rather strange that it not
1706560	1711480	only archived Matt's old videos prior to their sudden deletion, but chose to re-upload them
1711480	1715000	only after they served little purpose to discredit him.
1715020	1719700	Ultimately, Matt's old content serves as yet another wrinkle in the tapestry of confusing
1719700	1725500	circumstances around him, and provides further reason to doubt his motives for starting the controversy.
1731020	1736580	On February 19th, just 48 hours after arriving on the scene, Matt streamed on YouTube for
1736580	1737840	the final time.
1737840	1738840	So that's it, man.
1738840	1739840	I think we're set.
1739840	1740840	Thank you all.
1740840	1745220	Uh, you know, that's all I have to say, man.
1745220	1746540	Peace out.
1746540	1750500	After the stream went dark, Matt Watson disappeared from YouTube.
1750500	1754700	The YouTube Wake Up Twitter account, which was presumably operated by Matt, remained
1754700	1758900	active until the beginning of March before also falling dormant.
1758900	1762840	Matt's last known online activity can be found on his Reddit account.
1762840	1768340	On February 22nd, three days after his final stream, Matt posted a long, rambling, mostly
1768340	1772500	incoherent comment on the newly minted YouTube Wake Up subreddit.
1772500	1777620	In the post, he generalizes the mounting criticism as slanderous and continues to parrot the
1777620	1780520	same rhetoric about YouTubers being greedy.
1780520	1785660	He then goes on to sanctimoniously lecture us about the dangers of social media, presumably
1785660	1788960	as a means of accounting for his future absence.
1788960	1794080	As of July 1st, 2019, Matt Watson has vanished from the web.
1794080	1799240	Many details about his personal life or current whereabouts remain a mystery to this day.
1799240	1804120	Later in 2019, the COPPA controversy once again placed YouTube's child safety standards
1804120	1805520	in serious doubt.
1805520	1810960	Despite COPPA providing Matt with ample incentive to return, he has thus far decided to remain
1810960	1815420	a poltergeist to the digital world, leaving the rest of us to wonder what in the world
1815420	1816740	just happened.
1816740	1820940	When we come back, we will discuss the alternative theories of what Matt was really trying to
1820940	1844860	accomplish by making YouTube wake up.

1922660	1930340	I can't take any more of these ad boycotts.
1930340	1934860	The prevailing narrative regarding the YouTube wake up controversy is pretty much everything
1934860	1937220	that was reported by the mainstream media.
1937220	1941480	The general public assumed that Matt was simply acting as a good Samaritan and exposing the
1941480	1943740	issue as part of his civic duty.
1943740	1947660	Most people, especially the ones on Reddit, assumed that Matt was portraying these issues
1947660	1949580	fairly and honestly.
1949580	1953660	The Reddit traffic and heavy media coverage were thought to be organic and a result of
1953660	1958100	people passionately caring about the issue by demanding accountability from YouTube.
1958100	1962580	For those outside the YouTube scene, Matt's mission to contact advertisers seemed like
1962580	1967600	a reasonable enough method to inspire change and the subsequent advertiser boycott came
1967600	1971300	as a logical consequence of Matt's well-intentioned campaign.
1971300	1975660	For almost everyone aware of the controversy, this was a satisfactory explanation for the
1975660	1977060	sequence of events.
1977060	1982220	However, as we discussed previously, delving deeper into the details of the situation reveals
1982220	1987340	a lot of strange inconsistencies that place the mainstream theory into serious doubt.
1987340	1992500	The following theories will attempt to account for the most dubious discrepancies, more specifically
1992500	1997380	analyzing Matt's behavior to deduce his true motivation for inciting the YouTube wake-up
1997380	1998380	controversy.
1998380	2006700	So today I was on the internet and I was looking at how to build a successful YouTube channel
2006700	2011100	and one of the two things they recommended was to be super high energy!
2011100	2015240	Given the sequence of events, the first theory many would consider is that Matt Watson wanted
2015240	2018380	to get revenge on the platform for some unknown reason.
2018380	2023080	Based on his apparent hatred for YouTube specifically and his unwillingness to cooperate
2023080	2029580	with YouTubers in any capacity.
2029580	2034680	The crux of this theory comes from the inconsistency of Matt's overall knowledge of the platform.
2034680	2039700	He had no problem setting up a live stream, but claimed to have no idea how to edit monetization
2039700	2048140	settings.
2048140	2053040	He seemed very familiar with watching certain channels, but somehow neglected obvious examples
2053040	2057280	of those same YouTubers supporting the cause he claimed to represent.
2057280	2061700	Even though Matt's behavior reflected someone with years of experience on the platform,
2061700	2066420	he would frequently play dumb to his audience, acting ignorant to very basic features on
2066420	2073260	the site.
2073260	2077980	Of course, many commentators would eventually expose that Matt did, in fact, spend at least
2077980	2083260	two years making content before the controversy, content which he deliberately tried to obfuscate
2083260	2084700	from public view.
2084700	2088940	Much of YouTube's commentary community seemed to reach the consensus that Matt Watson was
2088940	2101900	a failed YouTuber who manufactured the controversy for views and attention.
2101900	2106700	After spending years trying and failing to grow his channel, Matt began to resent YouTube
2106700	2111060	and its more successful creators, with that resentment eventually boiling over into a
2111060	2112540	full-on vendetta.
2112540	2117860	Eventually, he hatched a plan to sabotage the platform and its greedy creators.
2117860	2122100	YouTube Wake Up was a result of Matt actively seeking revenge on YouTube.
2122100	2127140	While the rogue YouTuber theory may explain Matt's abrasive attitude towards other creators,
2127140	2130060	it doesn't account for many other discrepancies.
2130060	2134620	First of all, the commentator consensus that Matt manufactured the controversy for fame
2134620	2139500	doesn't hold up when you factor in his subsequent disappearance from the internet as a whole.
2139500	2144540	Matt clearly acted with grander motivations than simply furthering his own status.
2144540	2149060	Additionally, this theory creates inconsistencies with Matt's level of competence throughout
2149060	2150540	the whole process.
2150540	2154700	Are we supposed to believe that Matt is capable of manipulating thousands of people to do
2154700	2159060	his bidding, but he can't figure out how to make people watch his YouTube videos?
2159060	2163300	If he knew how to exploit Reddit Karma to boost his viewership, why not just use that
2163300	2165860	tactic on his existing content?
2165860	2170420	This theory paints Matt as a failed YouTuber who grew disillusioned with the platform,
2170420	2175100	yet he gained almost 20,000 subscribers and more than a million total views in just two
2175100	2180260	years of making videos, which is far more successful than most channels at that point.
2180260	2185020	With that being said, his apparent motive for hating YouTube appears much more flimsy,
2185020	2189240	suggesting that he had a different incentive than just getting revenge on the popular kids.
2189240	2193540	And even if he did start the controversy because he hated the platform, why was his
2193540	2196600	campaign so successful in particular?
2196600	2200780	Every year, dozens of videos come out seeking to expose YouTube's dirty dealings to the
2200780	2202200	general public.
2202200	2207520	And so far, Matt's video stands alone as the only YouTube expose to garner significant
2207520	2209280	mainstream attention.
2209280	2211900	Was it all a coincidence or just dumb luck?
2211900	2216360	Could be either, but it's far more likely that a few hidden entities had vested interest
2216360	2218480	in Matt's video succeeding.
2218480	2222840	I am once again asking for your financial support.
2222840	2226400	In leftist communities online, there's been a fixation at how YouTube's algorithm has
2226400	2228120	promoted right-wing content.
2228120	2232640	Many argue that YouTube has inadvertently created a pipeline in which viewers are recommended
2232640	2235680	political content that gradually radicalizes them.
2235680	2239400	So you'll start with one or two videos of a red-haired college feminist and end up on
2239400	2241840	videos about demographic replacement.
2241840	2245800	This is the thesis of ideas like the PewDiePie pipeline as well as the motivation for them
2245800	2247840	to produce their own content.
2247840	2251900	While Matt's video predates the PewDiePie pipeline, this asserted rabbit hole was covered
2251900	2256280	extensively in a research paper by Rebecca Lewis for Data and Society.
2256280	2261080	Published in September of 2018, the abstract summarizes their view of YouTube rather well.
2261080	2264720	YouTube is a principal online news source for young people, which is why it's concerning
2264720	2269320	that YouTube, a subsidiary of Google, has become the single most important hub by which
2269320	2273720	an extensive network of far-right influencers profit from broadcasting propaganda to young
2273720	2274760	viewers.
2274760	2278920	This study received not just news coverage, but was also the foundation for this video
2278920	2283680	by YouTuber Three Arrows, which has since accumulated nearly 1 million views.
2283680	2286080	How is this relevant to Matt Watson, you may ask?
2286080	2290520	Well, nearly one month after Matt Watson swore to never return again, he made a reappearance
2290520	2291520	on Reddit.
2291520	2294700	YouTube's algorithm is the mirror of its average user.
2294700	2297080	Start with PewDiePie and with F*****.
2297080	2299400	Start with Joe Rogan and with Shapiro.
2299400	2302120	Start with news and with the F*****.
2302120	2305980	Less than two months later, Matt Watson posted again in the subreddit, this time in a thread
2305980	2307520	calling for action.
2307520	2308520	Its title reads,
2308520	2310040	Turn off your ad blocker.
2310040	2311520	Go to f****** subreddits.
2311520	2314200	Take screenshots of ads next to f****** content.
2314200	2317920	Send the screenshots to companies and ask why they're promoting f******ism.
2317920	2319800	Matt Watson simply commented on this post,
2319800	2323260	Yup, I can attest that this strategy works.
2323260	2326080	There are a number of reasons as to why this is significant.
2326080	2330720	Firstly, one has to remember that at this point, Matt had already essentially been forgotten.
2330720	2335680	No one seemed to recognize him when he commented, even though he referenced his grand accomplishment.
2335680	2340280	So one should view this as his mask off moment, how he behaves when he's no longer in the
2340280	2341680	public's eye.
2341680	2345180	But you also have to take this into consideration with the context of his content before the
2345180	2346880	YouTube wake up scandal.
2346880	2351600	On his comedy channel, he made videos mocking the Manosphere, where he would parody f******
2351600	2352700	pickup artists.
2352700	2357160	He clearly had a vested interest in opposing these fringe communities, and these comments
2357160	2361120	reveal that he views ad boycotts as a proportionate response to them.
2361120	2364760	So it's not out of the realm of possibility that he had an ulterior motive.
2364760	2368800	Additionally, it provides an explanation for his disdain of other YouTubers.
2368800	2371760	He comments on a thread mocking Boogie2988,
2371760	2373760	YouTube and its content creators are one and the same.
2373760	2376040	They only give a f*** about money.
2376040	2377040	Enforcing policies?
2377040	2378040	Nah.
2378040	2382120	These content creators are such self-centered pieces of trash, there is a direct correlation
2382120	2385800	between how garbage their content is and how frequently you'll find them wincing about
2385800	2388560	SJW boogie men coming for their adsense.
2388560	2393160	Remember, when he first released his video, he framed himself as an outsider.
2393160	2396880	But as that facade began to slip away, he revealed that he was fairly knowledgeable
2396880	2401280	about the commentary community.
2401280	2405440	What this tells us about Matt is that going into the controversy, he was familiar with
2405440	2407440	the YouTubers he was screwing over.
2407440	2412000	And surprise surprise, most of them are associated with the anti-SJW rabbit hole.
2412000	2415760	Many have interpreted Matt as simply not understanding the collateral damage he was going to cause.
2415760	2420040	But since he's acknowledged both their past and present influence, he can't claim
2420040	2421040	ignorance.
2421040	2424480	And this, by proxy, sheds a doubt on his stated motivations.
2424480	2428840	It's now entirely plausible that he could have been concern trolling, inciting a PR
2428840	2433760	disaster under false pretenses to undercut the financial earnings of propagandists.
2433760	2437240	And then, after it was all said and done, he could sit back and laugh as they've all
2437240	2442520	been relegated to becoming Uber drivers.
2442520	2446080	Money at his post from before the controversy revealed that it was Jordan Peterson that
2446080	2449080	led him to broaden his focus from just the manosphere.
2449080	2455000	Sometimes it feels like the f***ing manosphere anti-SJW types permeate every corner of YouTube.
2455000	2459040	It seems like no matter what video I watch, the comments are infected with angry s***lords
2459040	2463600	whining about feminism, liberals, and or whatever minority group they can scapegoat for the
2463600	2464600	world's woes.
2464600	2466440	It's f***ing depressing.
2466440	2470040	At this point, it's worth clarifying that if all this is true, Matt had an extremely
2470040	2471320	flawed plan.
2471320	2476400	By broadly attacking all content creators, he skewered not just right-wingers, but LGBT
2476400	2477800	creators and leftists.
2477800	2481880	Remember, YouTube is a platform where pretty much anyone can upload videos.
2481880	2486560	This makes it an invaluable tool for financially unstable people to have a voice.
2486560	2490440	As YouTube becomes less sustainable as a job, the people being affected the most are the
2490440	2492440	ones who can't afford to do it anymore.
2492440	2496320	If Matt's intention was to combat right-wing pundits, the best way to avoid this collateral
2496320	2498840	damage would have been to fight them using the algorithm.
2498880	2503040	Instead, he chose to do the more woke thing of pandering to millionaire ad agencies.
2503040	2507120	But with all that said, the uncertainty of this theory and his general incompetence makes
2507120	2508640	it impossible to confirm.
2508640	2512560	Sure, he was celebrating his victory after the fact, but he always stopped short of saying
2512560	2513560	he did it intentionally.
2513560	2516840	And it's not like he wasn't aware of the leftists he was going to hurt.
2516840	2520920	Prior to the controversy, he'd advised an aspiring left-wing creator to only do it for
2520920	2523240	fun, because it didn't pay like it used to.
2523240	2526920	And throughout all his messages, despite posting in a leftist community, he never seems to
2526920	2528520	talk about class.
2528520	2533280	So maybe it's possible that Matt wasn't motivated by feelings of class solidarity.
2533280	2536960	Maybe he did have ulterior motives, but ones that were even more covert than his Reddit
2536960	2538280	account let on.
2538280	2542600	What if Matt Watson wasn't trying to be a proletariat hero, but instead the exact
2542600	2544760	opposite, a corporate shill?
2550200	2554320	One of the strangest aspects about Matt that has thus far gone unexplained is the lack
2554320	2557560	of any substantial information about his identity.
2557600	2562160	Aside from those who deliberately remain anonymous, nearly all leaders of social movements have
2562160	2566420	some sort of paper trail that reveal aspects about their personal lives.
2566420	2569740	As far as we know, Matt Watson is a blank slate.
2569740	2574180	How can this be the case for someone who spent days openly broadcasting his name and face
2574180	2576120	for the whole world to see?
2576120	2579960	Throughout all this exposure, you'd think that at least one YouTuber or one Redditor
2579960	2585140	or one newsreader would know the guy in person and be able to divulge any sort of details
2585140	2586720	about his identity.
2586720	2591520	All this seems extraordinarily bizarre until you consider the possibility that Matt Watson,
2591520	2594400	as we know him, doesn't actually exist.
2594400	2599720	Each spring, media companies and advertisers hold annual meetings called Upfronts.
2599720	2603900	Upfronts were originally used by television networks to partition and sell commercial
2603900	2606440	time for brands to market their products.
2606440	2611240	Eventually, Upfronts expanded to the digital space, and companies now use these meetings
2611240	2614880	to determine their online marketing budget for the upcoming year.
2614880	2619280	YouTube has typically hosted their Upfront in the first week of May, but Upfront negotiations
2619280	2622580	across all networks span into the beginning of March.
2622580	2626980	This time frame is significant to our theory because it indicates that brands must outline
2626980	2631180	their tentative advertising budgets by the end of February, the time period that just
2631180	2634000	so happens to align with YouTube Wake Up.
2634000	2637720	It also happens to align with another infamous YouTube controversy.
2637720	2643140	In February 2017, Wall Street Journal reporter Jack Nikas would co-publish an article accusing
2643140	2645500	PewDiePie of antisemitism.
2645500	2650340	Much like Matt Watson's campaign, the Wall Street Journal seemingly manufactured a controversy
2650340	2651740	out of thin air.
2651740	2656340	Much like Matt's video, the article was manipulative and deceptive, and also featured
2656340	2661540	a strange emphasis on advertisers as well as YouTube's supposed responsibility to
2661540	2663700	micromanage its creators.
2663700	2668900	One month later, Jack Nikas would target advertisers head-on by using a singular screenshot to
2668900	2672000	accuse YouTube of running ads on racist content.
2672000	2677220	He would curiously omit a key detail that the video was monetized not by the uploader,
2677220	2679440	but by a music copyright claim.
2679440	2683960	Rather than blame the music companies, who frequently operate above the law on YouTube,
2683960	2689040	Nikas would instead blame YouTube itself and instigate the first adpocalypse.
2689040	2693360	In the following months, YouTube would implement sweeping changes to the revenue system on
2693360	2698920	the site, most notably mass demonetization, introduction of the hidden channel rating
2698920	2702240	volume, and the subsequent suppression of edgy content.
2702240	2706260	A tremendous impact, all from a single misleading article.
2706260	2710440	If you're noticing a pattern here, it's probably that springtime on YouTube is starting
2710440	2715200	to bring a vigorous bloom of dubious controversy and advertiser boycotts.
2715200	2718480	Do you think it's possible that these two prickly plants may have sprouted from the
2718480	2719920	same seed?
2719920	2724040	It's possible that Matt Watson was no ordinary garden variety plant.
2724040	2728640	He may very well have been an industry plant, a fulcrum through which brands attempted to
2728640	2731200	leverage cheaper ad rates on YouTube.
2731200	2735840	The entire ad boycott was just a smokescreen for companies to renegotiate their existing
2735840	2739520	contracts with YouTube and return at a lower rate.
2739520	2745000	At the time of the YouTube wake-up controversy, many companies had ample incentive to do so.
2745000	2749560	Ever since the first adpocalypse, YouTube had been secretly subsidizing numerous brand
2749560	2754440	safety agencies, third-party companies who worked with major corporate clients to ensure
2754440	2758200	that their ads would not appear alongside questionable content.
2758200	2762760	In hopes of enticing major brands back to the platform, YouTube essentially refunded
2762760	2767480	the charges of these third-party services so brands could access them for free.
2767480	2772160	At the end of 2018, YouTube disclosed that they would no longer be footing the bill and
2772160	2776560	that advertisers would now have to pay for brand safety services on their own.
2776560	2781360	This announcement frustrated both the third-party services and their clients, who now both faced
2781360	2784040	unexpected budgetary complications.
2784040	2787740	You have to imagine that heading into the new year, some of them were looking to recoup
2787740	2789080	their losses.
2789080	2793640	On February 6th, Business Insider published an article revealing that YouTube was no longer
2793640	2796380	subsidizing brand safety agencies.
2796380	2801420	Just 11 days later, Matt Watson would initiate the YouTube wake-up controversy while heavily
2801420	2804560	emphasizing that YouTube is unsafe for brands.
2804560	2807780	But I have multiple examples of big-name brands.
2807780	2810900	We're talking Dodge Ram, Disney in one video.
2810900	2816600	I can't imagine what these brands are going to say about their content appearing on these
2816600	2817600	kinds of videos.
2817600	2819240	Think about the consequences of this.
2819240	2821300	You have a Disney advert.
2821300	2827640	You have a McDonald's advert appearing on a video where a creep is time-stamping a little
2827640	2828640	girl.
2828640	2834120	If news outlets start reporting this and brands like McDonald's find out that their advertising
2834120	2842360	is appearing on these videos, YouTube will do something.
2842360	2846080	There's no denying that these companies have incredible reach and influence.
2846560	2850160	The Amazon slate was notably partnered with GroupM, the largest advertising company in
2850160	2854840	the world, and one that claims to be responsible for a third of all ads broadcasted.
2854840	2859080	They certainly have the means to pull some strings in the mainstream media, especially
2859080	2863580	in an age where news outlets have been revealed to be increasingly corrupt.
2863580	2868340	These days, most news agendas are determined not by what's newsworthy, but by what's profitable
2868340	2873760	for those running the show, and YouTube wake-up sought to make many companies a lot of money.
2873760	2877440	This theory explains how Matt's campaign got so much coverage.
2877440	2881440	The brands had always been planning to pull out, they just needed an angry activist to
2881440	2883520	provide them with the opportunity.
2883520	2887000	It's possible that the key to solving the mystery of Matt Watson may have been hiding
2887000	2889200	in plain sight this whole time.
2889200	2893720	This whole thing was never about protecting kids, some brands even admitted it.
2893720	2897680	Practically all of them eventually returned to YouTube, likely at a cheaper rate than
2897680	2898800	before.
2898800	2904800	As for Matt, well, as far as we know, his entire channel, story, and persona is a fabrication.
2904800	2909320	The reason we can't find anything on his identity is that Matt Watson, as we know him, doesn't
2909320	2910680	actually exist.
2910680	2915600	Matt Watson was just the alias of a covert agent, hired to do a very specific job by
2915600	2917280	an unknown entity.
2917280	2921320	Once he accomplished his mission, he no longer had any reason to stick around.
2921320	2926920	Uh, in the description, I've included all the social media contact information for every
2926920	2933400	brand that appears in my video, and I've included a timestamp for where exactly that
2933400	2934880	brand appears in my video.
2934880	2940520	Uh, in the description, I've included all the social media contact information for every
2940520	2947400	brand.
2947400	2952480	Of course, like the other theories, the industry plant hypothesis doesn't account for everything.
2952480	2957200	If Matt really was a hired agent, then how could you explain his older content?
2957200	2961280	It seems rather ridiculous to suggest that he was planning this stunt for more than two
2961280	2962280	years.
2962280	2966900	If the advertisers needed an unsuspecting plant to orchestrate a controversy, then why
2966900	2971860	select one with any sort of history attached to his account, especially one with history
2971860	2974280	as bizarre as Matt's old content?
2974280	2979280	Additionally, as with any conspiracy containing a ton of moving parts, this theory potentially
2979280	2982400	involves a lot of people that would need to be kept quiet.
2982400	2987280	And finally, if it was really that easy for companies to take advantage of YouTube, shouldn't
2987280	2991080	we have seen a bunch of Matt Watsons popping up all over the place?
2991080	2998080	At least for now, that remains to be seen.
2998080	3007920	Unfortunately, we may never know Matt Watson's true intentions with the YouTube Wake Up campaign.
3007920	3012080	At the end of the day, all of our theories are nothing more than educated guesses and
3012080	3016760	unless we get some serious testimony from any of the parties involved, all we can do
3016760	3018400	is wonder.
3018400	3023140	Speculation aside, it is fairly evident from the facts of the case that we should be skeptical
3023140	3026680	of Matt Watson's self-proclaimed mission to protect children.
3026680	3030800	The circumstances surrounding his behavior were too suspicious and contradictory for
3030800	3033200	us to buy into the official narrative.
3033200	3038120	It's obvious that Matt had some hidden agenda, but what exactly that agenda was may forever
3038120	3039800	remain up for debate.
3039800	3043360	One thing for certain is that the fulfillment of Matt's agenda came at the expense of
3043360	3045740	both YouTube and its creators.
3045740	3050480	The meteoric success of YouTube Wake Up may be indicative of changing tides in the digital
3050480	3051520	landscape.
3051520	3055720	The controversy likely represents one of the mounting consequences of YouTube's de facto
3055720	3059220	monopoly on long-form user-generated content.
3059220	3063580	As the site continues to scale beyond the limits of human control, the platform will
3063580	3066660	keep finding itself in more precarious positions.
3066660	3070260	These days it's more than just creators who are growing increasingly frustrated by
3070260	3071900	their lack of options.
3071900	3076300	With billions in corporate transactions on the line, YouTube is under more pressure than
3076300	3078760	ever to perform to a certain standard.
3078760	3083340	In the future, YouTube may further transform into a battleground between clashing corporate
3083340	3087100	titans while the rest of us are just along for the ride.
3087100	3091700	Ultimately, Matt Watson exposed YouTube's most confounding issue of all.
3091700	3095380	Not their lack of child safety, but their lack of communication.
3095380	3099740	Perhaps the biggest factor that made YouTube Wake Up so successful was YouTube's complete
3099740	3104140	failure to inform the public on hardly anything happening on the platform.
3104140	3108220	YouTube is a site that likes to shroud itself in a cloud of mystery so that they can operate
3108220	3111080	invisibly to the prying public eye.
3111080	3115560	They thrive within an information vacuum, leaving the general public totally ignorant
3115560	3118300	to even the site's most basic features.
3118300	3123240	It was this ignorance which Matt Watson exploited to transform a simple expose into one of the
3123240	3126200	biggest controversies the site had ever seen.
3126200	3130800	His blatant dishonesty should have been immediately debunked, yet it was only detected by the
3130800	3133360	most savvy creators on the platform.
3133360	3138520	The vast majority of observers accepted Matt's emotionally charged rhetoric as the truth,
3138520	3140760	and YouTube paid the price.
3140760	3142240	Honesty is a two-way street.
3142240	3146360	The more you hide from the public, the less likely they are to trust you.
3146360	3152280	After burning so many of us for so long, it's hard for anybody to trust YouTube these days.
3152280	3156800	YouTube Wake Up serves as the ultimate indictment to the site's severe transparency issue.
3156800	3161440	It also serves as an indictment against the site's total lack of direction or leadership.
3161440	3165780	It's safe to say that over the past half-decade, YouTube's internal decision-making can only
3165780	3167600	be described as hapless.
3167600	3172000	Whether it's their persistently baffling and unwanted policy changes, their totally
3172000	3176340	inconsistent enforcement of the rules, or their preferential treatment for the vapid
3176340	3181360	celebrities at the top of the site, many of YouTube's issues are completely self-imposed,
3181360	3185520	brought about mostly by their inability to think proactively about future obstacles.
3185520	3189920	Lately, the direction of the site seems about as coherent as a headless chicken, like how
3189920	3194560	YouTube has spent the past five years dedicating an entire section of the site to kindergartners
3194560	3200320	only to scramble and panic when, shockingly, targeting them with ads was against the law.
3200320	3204460	Much of YouTube's aimlessness could be attributed to their pitifully weak leadership.
3204460	3209000	In the event of a crisis like the Matt Watson controversy, most YouTubers have nowhere to
3209000	3210880	turn for news and guidance.
3210880	3214880	Who is supposed to be YouTube's spokesperson in situations like these?
3214880	3217640	The anonymous Team YouTube Twitter account?
3217640	3220680	Susan with her bi-annual blog posts?
3220680	3225880	How is it that a guy like Matt Watson, a single angry dude in his bedroom, is a more effective
3225880	3229120	leader and communicator than anyone at YouTube?
3229120	3233280	YouTube Wake Up once again proves that unless the platform makes some major changes in their
3233280	3237280	management, they will continue to get eaten alive by companies who know they can get away
3237280	3238280	with it.
3238280	3242820	Until YouTube's administration can learn to effectively communicate its goals and solutions
3242820	3247480	to the greater public, cowardly decision-making will continue to threaten the stability of
3247480	3248480	the site.
3248480	3253040	In the future, we may either look back on Matt Watson as an anomaly or as the beginning
3253040	3255240	of a far more sinister trend.
3255240	3259280	I'm sure that every creator would hope that controversies like YouTube Wake Up remain
3259280	3260640	in the past.
3260640	3265640	Matt Watson sparked a wave of rage and disgust by supposedly uncovering a wormhole.
3265640	3269880	Nobody realized that the real wormhole would be the mystery behind Matt himself.
3269880	3274640	Whoever he was and whatever he was doing here, Matt Watson will go down as YouTube's most
3274640	3275920	infamous red herring.
3315240	3324720	Thanks for watching.
