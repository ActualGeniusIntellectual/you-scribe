1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:22,680
In the waning hours of February 17th, 2019, a YouTuber under the alias of Matt's What

2
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:27,180
It Is uploaded a video that would send shockwaves across the entire site.

3
00:00:27,180 --> 00:00:31,720
By morning, the video would reach the front page of Reddit, accumulating millions of views

4
00:00:31,720 --> 00:00:32,900
on YouTube.

5
00:00:32,900 --> 00:00:36,980
All of a sudden, waves of outrage inundate every corner of the web.

6
00:00:36,980 --> 00:00:41,800
YouTube now faces ferocious controversy over Matt's allegations that the platform is willfully

7
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:44,720
harboring child predators.

8
00:00:44,720 --> 00:00:49,260
YouTube reacts swiftly by deactivating the comment sections of thousands of child-oriented

9
00:00:49,260 --> 00:00:50,480
channels.

10
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:55,220
Their efforts to subdue the mounting outrage would prove futile, as the controversy was

11
00:00:55,220 --> 00:00:57,560
now spiraling out of control.

12
00:00:57,560 --> 00:01:03,020
Over the next five days, no fewer than 70 articles report on YouTube's child-endangerment

13
00:01:03,020 --> 00:01:04,020
problem.

14
00:01:04,020 --> 00:01:07,980
At around the same time, companies begin pulling their ads.

15
00:01:07,980 --> 00:01:14,160
McDonald's, Disney, Nestle, AT&T, Epic Games, some of YouTube's biggest corporate partners

16
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:16,040
withdraw their funding.

17
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:21,700
Ad rates falter site-wide, YouTubers scramble for answers, the whole platform is tumbling

18
00:01:21,700 --> 00:01:27,140
down a spiral of outraged parents, ravenous reporters, and terrified advertisers, all

19
00:01:27,140 --> 00:01:29,940
led by a single red-haired stranger.

20
00:01:29,940 --> 00:01:34,700
Then, just as quickly as he appeared, he vanished, never to return.

21
00:01:34,700 --> 00:01:56,220
Now, more than a year afterwards, we are only just beginning to pick up the pieces.

22
00:01:56,220 --> 00:02:01,460
First we have to talk about the man behind the mayhem, Matt Watson, a common, ordinary

23
00:02:01,460 --> 00:02:03,900
name for a common, ordinary man.

24
00:02:03,900 --> 00:02:08,020
You see, the best thing about being ordinary is that it's really easy to blend in with

25
00:02:08,020 --> 00:02:09,580
the rest of the crowd.

26
00:02:09,580 --> 00:02:14,360
And in the YouTube community, nobody had any idea who Matt Watson was.

27
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:18,900
No one had any contact with him on Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, Discord.

28
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:21,420
The guy was a total outsider.

29
00:02:21,420 --> 00:02:25,920
Simple online searches for the stranger revealed a few other past social media accounts with

30
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:27,600
limited information.

31
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:32,020
The most substantial discovery would be his former YouTube channel, a channel that housed

32
00:02:32,020 --> 00:02:34,580
some rather strange videos.

33
00:02:34,580 --> 00:02:40,060
But all things considered, Matt's old videos only raised more questions than they answered.

34
00:02:40,060 --> 00:02:44,860
Ultimately, they provided no further details about his identity, occupation, or greater

35
00:02:44,860 --> 00:02:46,680
purpose on the platform.

36
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:51,380
When the time came, he stormed into YouTube as an army of one, but prepared to recruit

37
00:02:51,380 --> 00:03:00,540
many others to his cause.

38
00:03:00,540 --> 00:03:06,460
And wake up, the brick in the window that started the riot, ground zero of YouTube's

39
00:03:06,460 --> 00:03:11,420
worst meltdown yet, a video that left many of its viewers red in the face and ready to

40
00:03:11,420 --> 00:03:17,140
burn the site to the ground.

41
00:03:17,140 --> 00:03:22,100
But amidst the anger, chaos, and disgust, many lost sight of whether the video was actually

42
00:03:22,100 --> 00:03:23,100
accurate.

43
00:03:23,100 --> 00:03:26,020
At a glance, Matt's efforts seemed noble enough.

44
00:03:26,020 --> 00:03:30,720
Child predation is a universally scorned activity, and Matt was doing his civic duty

45
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:34,460
by alerting the greater public of a rather egregious example.

46
00:03:34,460 --> 00:03:39,540
The issues of Matt's video and his subsequent livestreams stem from his odd mischaracterizations

47
00:03:39,540 --> 00:03:42,820
of YouTube and the YouTube community as a whole.

48
00:03:42,820 --> 00:03:46,780
Several of the implications in the video range from deceptive to outright lies about the

49
00:03:46,780 --> 00:03:48,860
platform and its creators.

50
00:03:48,860 --> 00:03:53,220
To the average layman, the video may have seemed perfectly fine, but to seasoned YouTube

51
00:03:53,220 --> 00:03:56,940
veterans, these issues became a lot more apparent.

52
00:03:56,940 --> 00:04:01,660
First and foremost, the video is predicated entirely on the point that YouTube is facilitating

53
00:04:01,660 --> 00:04:06,700
a rabbit hole of content that connects bad actors with unsuspecting children and each

54
00:04:06,700 --> 00:04:19,940
other.

55
00:04:19,940 --> 00:04:24,140
The way Matt presents this, the audience is left to assume that YouTube is either grossly

56
00:04:24,140 --> 00:04:29,740
negligent, or worse, intentionally aiding child exploitation on the platform.

57
00:04:29,740 --> 00:04:33,580
And while YouTubers certainly know saints in this regard, specifically highlighting

58
00:04:33,580 --> 00:04:38,540
these videos and comments as a wormhole of scum and villainy is deceptive because it

59
00:04:38,540 --> 00:04:43,260
overlooks the fundamental directive of the general video recommendation algorithm on

60
00:04:43,260 --> 00:04:44,260
YouTube.

61
00:04:44,260 --> 00:04:48,260
Once you enter into this wormhole for whatever reason, YouTube's algorithm is glitching

62
00:04:48,260 --> 00:04:52,740
out to a point that nothing but these videos exist.

63
00:04:52,740 --> 00:04:58,160
If you look up any category of video on YouTube, the algorithm will recommend you more videos

64
00:04:58,160 --> 00:04:59,380
like it.

65
00:04:59,380 --> 00:05:07,300
This applies to cartoons, basketball, mukbang, ASMR, wasp removal videos, anything you enjoy

66
00:05:07,300 --> 00:05:08,300
watching.

67
00:05:08,300 --> 00:05:12,980
It's the algorithm's job to indiscriminately serve you more videos that will keep you on

68
00:05:12,980 --> 00:05:13,980
the site.

69
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:16,300
The key word being indiscriminate.

70
00:05:16,340 --> 00:05:18,860
The algorithm doesn't know morality.

71
00:05:18,860 --> 00:05:23,160
Its job is not to tell you if what you're watching is ethically wrong.

72
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:28,340
Its only purpose is to deduce what you like watching and give you more of it.

73
00:05:28,340 --> 00:05:32,260
The problem with Matt's video is that he presents an incredibly myopic view of the

74
00:05:32,260 --> 00:05:44,220
algorithm by highlighting only its capacity for abuse by bad actors.

75
00:05:44,220 --> 00:05:50,340
A deeper dive into YouTube will reveal a variety of dark, disturbing, and macabre wormholes.

76
00:05:50,340 --> 00:05:55,020
YouTube is not facilitating the abuse of baby monkeys for example.

77
00:05:55,020 --> 00:06:00,140
These wormholes only exist because of the strange users who inhabit them.

78
00:06:00,140 --> 00:06:04,660
It is the people who abuse this framework that create the wormhole.

79
00:06:04,660 --> 00:06:09,400
YouTube only provides the framework and expecting them to manually patrol the activities of

80
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:12,940
billions of independent users is simply impossible.

81
00:06:12,940 --> 00:06:15,660
But therein lies the issue with Matt's video.

82
00:06:15,660 --> 00:06:20,060
Matt portrays the wormhole as if it's YouTube's direct responsibility.

83
00:06:20,060 --> 00:06:24,980
Matt implies it's YouTube's fault that predators are on the platform and therefore

84
00:06:24,980 --> 00:06:33,980
that YouTube deserves to be punished.

85
00:06:33,980 --> 00:06:39,500
Is it really YouTube's fault that unsupervised children ignore YouTube's minimum age requirement

86
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:41,740
to upload videos of themselves?

87
00:06:41,740 --> 00:06:46,260
Is it YouTube's fault that foolish parents post videos of their children to a public

88
00:06:46,260 --> 00:06:52,580
platform for the whole world to see?

89
00:06:52,580 --> 00:06:56,760
Are we supposed to expect YouTube to moderate the comment sections of each and every video

90
00:06:56,760 --> 00:07:01,220
as if the individual uploaders are unable to do so themselves?

91
00:07:01,220 --> 00:07:05,940
YouTube has made its fair share of missteps in its handling of children on the platform,

92
00:07:05,940 --> 00:07:11,100
many of which I have personally criticized before, but in this video Matt heavily implies

93
00:07:11,100 --> 00:07:15,500
that YouTube is totally indifferent towards child endangerment and that they essentially

94
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:31,020
allow predators to have a field day on the platform.

95
00:07:31,020 --> 00:07:35,420
This is a blatantly false narrative and can be disproven using events that happened the

96
00:07:35,420 --> 00:07:38,460
very week before Matt uploaded his video.

97
00:07:38,460 --> 00:07:43,360
The week of February 15th, multiple channels were terminated by YouTube without warning.

98
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:47,620
They would later find out that they were unjust victims of a new YouTube initiative to remove

99
00:07:47,620 --> 00:07:49,940
videos with CP in the title.

100
00:07:49,940 --> 00:07:54,180
It just so happens that in this case, they forgot to whitelist videos about Club Penguin

101
00:07:54,180 --> 00:07:56,720
and Pokemon Go combat points.

102
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:59,180
Was YouTube's decision clumsy and misguided?

103
00:07:59,180 --> 00:08:03,940
Yes, absolutely, but to claim that YouTube isn't trying to combat child endangerment

104
00:08:03,940 --> 00:08:06,380
on the platform is simply dishonest.

105
00:08:06,380 --> 00:08:13,560
This would pop up, this would load, and you would see that there was some sort of unusual

106
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:17,400
behavior going on here and there's some sort of glitch in the algorithm.

107
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:21,900
Not only does Matt mislead the audience about YouTube's efforts, he then goes on to misrepresent

108
00:08:21,900 --> 00:08:24,120
the entire YouTube community.

109
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:29,740
Matt ends his expose with a montage of YouTubers complaining about demonetization, which is

110
00:08:29,740 --> 00:08:35,740
intended to paint YouTubers as self-centered and oblivious to the real problem on the platform.

111
00:08:35,740 --> 00:08:39,920
When confronted about his questionable claims on his subsequent live streams, Matt would

112
00:08:39,920 --> 00:08:44,620
get very defensive and often retort with the claim that YouTubers are purposely ignoring

113
00:08:44,620 --> 00:08:49,180
child endangerment because they are motivated only by their own selfish greed.

114
00:08:49,180 --> 00:08:51,520
That is literally your perspective.

115
00:08:51,520 --> 00:08:53,460
Your perspective is monetization.

116
00:08:53,460 --> 00:08:57,180
Frankly, they probably don't want to admit it, but they care more about money than they

117
00:08:57,180 --> 00:09:03,160
do about the fact that there's an easily exploitable ring of creepy child videos on YouTube.

118
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:05,500
They care more about money.

119
00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:08,540
When I say they, I'm not talking about YouTube, I'm talking about these fucking YouTubers

120
00:09:08,540 --> 00:09:10,040
who are salty as fuck.

121
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:11,040
Just admit it.

122
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:12,040
You're salty.

123
00:09:12,040 --> 00:09:16,480
This was an oddly ignorant and divisive stance considering that many high profile channels

124
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:20,860
have dedicated videos to combating child endangerment on the platform.

125
00:09:20,860 --> 00:09:25,620
Channels like Nerd City, H3H3, PewDiePie, and Pyrocynical have all exposed predatory

126
00:09:25,620 --> 00:09:26,620
content.

127
00:09:26,620 --> 00:09:31,580
Pyrocynical actually led to an entire wing of abusive content getting shut down.

128
00:09:31,580 --> 00:09:36,540
Paradoxically, Matt seems ignorant of this fact, yet he includes many of these same channels

129
00:09:36,540 --> 00:09:41,560
in his video while simultaneously shaming them for not caring about the issue.

130
00:09:41,560 --> 00:09:44,060
So does Matt watch these channels or not?

131
00:09:44,060 --> 00:09:49,260
Does he only pay attention to them specifically when they're complaining about getting demonetized?

132
00:09:49,260 --> 00:09:54,700
Matt's confrontational view of the YouTube community is so baffling that it becomes suspicious.

133
00:09:54,700 --> 00:09:59,020
What would Matt have to gain by throwing the entire YouTube community under the bus?

134
00:09:59,020 --> 00:10:03,700
I thought the issue here is child endangerment, which many YouTubers agree is a huge issue

135
00:10:03,700 --> 00:10:05,180
on the platform.

136
00:10:05,180 --> 00:10:07,960
Why would you not want them on your side?

137
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:12,460
This doesn't make any sense, unless of course you believe that Matt Watson had a different

138
00:10:12,460 --> 00:10:13,660
motive in mind.

139
00:10:21,820 --> 00:10:25,260
And I'm not one of these people that says, oh get a real job.

140
00:10:25,260 --> 00:10:26,980
Being a YouTuber isn't a real job.

141
00:10:26,980 --> 00:10:28,380
I don't think that at all.

142
00:10:28,380 --> 00:10:29,980
20 minutes later.

143
00:10:29,980 --> 00:10:32,140
You know, oh my monetization, bro.

144
00:10:32,140 --> 00:10:34,180
Yeah, there you go.

145
00:10:34,180 --> 00:10:35,620
Get a part-time job.

146
00:10:35,620 --> 00:10:38,420
Uber, Uber looks good for you.

147
00:10:38,420 --> 00:10:43,540
Matt Watson's demonstrable lies, deception, and dishonesty should confirm him as an unreliable

148
00:10:43,540 --> 00:10:44,540
narrator.

149
00:10:44,540 --> 00:10:49,420
His dubious behavior reeks of someone with a hidden agenda, an agenda which becomes more

150
00:10:49,420 --> 00:10:53,260
obvious with Matt's call to action in his exposé.

151
00:10:53,260 --> 00:10:57,300
I hope with the video evidence that I have that more people find out about adverts being

152
00:10:57,300 --> 00:11:02,780
played on videos like this, and that YouTube shits the bed ten times worse than they did

153
00:11:02,780 --> 00:11:04,460
in 2017.

154
00:11:04,460 --> 00:11:10,500
Matt's plan to protect children on YouTube is to incite a mass boycott of YouTube's advertisers.

155
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:12,740
Guys, please contact them.

156
00:11:12,740 --> 00:11:14,940
Trust me, these companies care.

157
00:11:14,940 --> 00:11:16,020
People care.

158
00:11:16,020 --> 00:11:19,100
Don't worry, if this sounds ludicrous to you, you're correct.

159
00:11:19,100 --> 00:11:23,100
But it kind of makes sense if you're all riled up and bash your head against the wall a few

160
00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:24,900
times.

161
00:11:24,900 --> 00:11:30,020
Matt's rationale is to force YouTube to protect kids by hitting them where it hurts, in their

162
00:11:30,020 --> 00:11:31,020
wallets.

163
00:11:31,020 --> 00:11:33,940
Because remember, the only time that YouTube is going to do something is when it starts

164
00:11:33,940 --> 00:11:38,060
to hit their pocket, when it starts to hit their wallet.

165
00:11:38,060 --> 00:11:42,860
And the only way to get them to respond is through their wallet, and the only way to

166
00:11:42,860 --> 00:11:47,440
hit Google and hit YouTube is where it hurts, in their wallet.

167
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:52,100
Never mind the point that YouTube is already making an effort to stop predators, Matt is

168
00:11:52,100 --> 00:11:56,780
suggesting that hundreds of thousands of YouTube creators across the entire site lose

169
00:11:56,780 --> 00:12:02,420
revenue because of a few unmoderated comment sections completely out of their control.

170
00:12:02,420 --> 00:12:07,500
Matt is suggesting that rather than flagging and reporting the abusive videos, we take

171
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:14,020
money away from innocent creators so that YouTube will flag and report abusive videos.

172
00:12:14,020 --> 00:12:18,660
If you're not quite up to speed on how YouTube ads work, companies pay YouTube every time

173
00:12:18,660 --> 00:12:22,600
one of their ads gets placed on a video, and the revenue then gets split between the

174
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:24,740
creator and the platform.

175
00:12:24,740 --> 00:12:28,240
YouTube and its creators exist in a symbiotic relationship.

176
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:32,980
This is the primary reason why inciting ad boycotts makes no sense.

177
00:12:32,980 --> 00:12:37,100
Because to stab at the heart of YouTube, you must first drive the blade through thousands

178
00:12:37,100 --> 00:12:38,900
of innocent channels.

179
00:12:38,900 --> 00:12:45,080
Even if YouTube took 100% of the revenue, Matt's plan would still be totally nonsensical.

180
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:50,160
YouTube is one of the few massive websites that is not publicly traded on any stock exchange.

181
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:55,360
As I mentioned in previous videos, no one knows whether YouTube is even profitable.

182
00:12:55,360 --> 00:13:00,120
It's clear at this point that Google does not keep YouTube running as a lucrative venture.

183
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:04,760
They support YouTube because of its enormous market share in online video.

184
00:13:04,760 --> 00:13:09,240
What YouTube lacks in profit, it more than makes up for in influence.

185
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:13,440
YouTube itself may not bring in the big bucks for Google, but what it does bring in is the

186
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:15,080
customers who will.

187
00:13:15,080 --> 00:13:19,500
For this reason, YouTube will likely never have to worry about financial woes as long

188
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:25,680
as Google stays in business, which is why advertiser boycotts hold no actual leverage.

189
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:30,440
Every time this happens, the platform gets impacted far less than the creators, who don't

190
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:33,640
have the financial padding of a trillion dollar company.

191
00:13:33,640 --> 00:13:38,900
At some point, it seemed that Matt cared more about punishing YouTubers than punishing predators.

192
00:13:38,900 --> 00:13:43,840
He demonstrated this with his repeated insistence that any YouTuber who disagreed with inciting

193
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:48,460
an ad boycott was greedy.

194
00:13:48,460 --> 00:13:53,060
When YouTubers like Nerd City attempted to reason with Matt on these issues, he responded

195
00:13:53,060 --> 00:13:54,780
with total belligerence.

196
00:13:54,780 --> 00:13:57,920
The community was on his side for the first few days.

197
00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:01,820
People were sharing the video, we were stopping by his chat and saying like, you know, how

198
00:14:01,820 --> 00:14:02,820
can we help?

199
00:14:02,820 --> 00:14:04,100
Thank you for what you did.

200
00:14:04,100 --> 00:14:05,340
Nerd City is here.

201
00:14:05,340 --> 00:14:06,340
Okay.

202
00:14:06,340 --> 00:14:07,340
Who's Nerd City?

203
00:14:07,340 --> 00:14:08,740
I got to look all these people up.

204
00:14:08,740 --> 00:14:13,660
People like myself and Leon Lush and Keemstar were reaching out to him and saying, hey man,

205
00:14:13,660 --> 00:14:15,060
we're on the same page here.

206
00:14:15,060 --> 00:14:21,220
What you found is a problem and YouTube needs to address it, but pump the brakes on the

207
00:14:21,220 --> 00:14:22,740
contacting advertisers.

208
00:14:22,740 --> 00:14:24,300
That is not going to solve the problem.

209
00:14:24,820 --> 00:14:27,460
It's just going to injure YouTube, like potentially fatally.

210
00:14:27,460 --> 00:14:31,780
Matt just kept dismissing anything that YouTubers were saying to him about like, don't contact

211
00:14:31,780 --> 00:14:32,780
advertisers.

212
00:14:32,780 --> 00:14:33,780
Like don't do this yet.

213
00:14:33,780 --> 00:14:35,380
That's, that's the nuclear option.

214
00:14:35,380 --> 00:14:38,300
His stubbornness started to become the problem.

215
00:14:38,300 --> 00:14:42,700
Like he pretended he was listening and he would ask, act like, all right, man, I want

216
00:14:42,700 --> 00:14:43,700
to talk.

217
00:14:43,700 --> 00:14:44,700
Yeah.

218
00:14:44,700 --> 00:14:45,700
I'd love to talk to Keemstar.

219
00:14:45,700 --> 00:14:48,820
And he would put someone on live to talk on Discord.

220
00:14:48,820 --> 00:14:52,580
And then once they would say something he didn't like, he just, you know, put his hands

221
00:14:52,580 --> 00:14:55,980
over his ears and said, sorry, no, no, no, what I'm doing is right.

222
00:14:55,980 --> 00:15:00,340
And you're just greedy and YouTube is going to have to suffer for this.

223
00:15:00,340 --> 00:15:03,700
This means that YouTubers are going to suffer, unfortunately.

224
00:15:03,700 --> 00:15:08,980
The only way to get YouTube to do something about this is to hit them where it hurts.

225
00:15:08,980 --> 00:15:10,700
And that's in their wallet.

226
00:15:10,700 --> 00:15:14,980
There was never a point when Matt elaborated on how his plan was more effective than just

227
00:15:14,980 --> 00:15:17,260
manually reporting the predators.

228
00:15:17,260 --> 00:15:22,420
The rhetoric in his streams was akin to that of a political rally, featuring lots of sloganeering,

229
00:15:22,420 --> 00:15:24,460
dogmatic statements and emotional appeal.

230
00:15:24,460 --> 00:15:27,340
I mean, this is disgusting, disgusting comment.

231
00:15:27,340 --> 00:15:28,340
I'm disgusted.

232
00:15:28,340 --> 00:15:29,340
I'm disgusted.

233
00:15:29,340 --> 00:15:30,340
I'm angry.

234
00:15:30,340 --> 00:15:31,340
How does this exist?

235
00:15:31,340 --> 00:15:33,340
That's all I have to say.

236
00:15:33,340 --> 00:15:34,340
Disgusted.

237
00:15:34,340 --> 00:15:36,020
I've been more emotional in this video that I've wanted to be.

238
00:15:36,020 --> 00:15:38,560
I wanted to be more collected and calm.

239
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:43,620
Matt used his stream almost exclusively as a way to galvanize his audience into contacting

240
00:15:43,620 --> 00:15:44,940
brands.

241
00:15:44,940 --> 00:15:49,540
At times, it felt like pressuring advertisers to pull their funding was the only thing Matt

242
00:15:49,540 --> 00:15:51,540
cared about.

243
00:15:51,540 --> 00:15:54,260
Oh, yes, man.

244
00:15:54,260 --> 00:15:55,260
Yes.

245
00:15:55,260 --> 00:16:02,500
Dude, that's what I'm talking about.

246
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:04,500
We did it.

247
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:06,480
Thanks for bringing it to our attention, Jamie.

248
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:09,900
Our team is aware and investigating this material.

249
00:16:09,900 --> 00:16:13,000
It's good.

250
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:17,440
Now at this point, some of you may be starting to realize that Matt Watson wasn't quite the

251
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:20,500
noble vigilante that he originally appeared to be.

252
00:16:20,500 --> 00:16:31,700
Unfortunately for YouTube, too many people were unable to see through the illusion.

253
00:16:31,700 --> 00:16:36,480
The public outrage sparked by Matt's video was astounding, to say the least.

254
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:41,080
By morning, it had skyrocketed to the top of our videos, becoming one of the most widely

255
00:16:41,080 --> 00:16:43,680
shared videos in the history of the site.

256
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:48,760
Within a week of its upload, more than 70 news articles had reported on the controversy,

257
00:16:48,760 --> 00:16:52,000
with most directly linking Matt's video to readers.

258
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:56,380
With all this considered, Matt Watson had single-handedly incited possibly the most

259
00:16:56,380 --> 00:16:59,680
circulated controversy in the history of YouTube.

260
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:04,680
In terms of initial media coverage, only Logan Paul's most infamous controversy was comparable

261
00:17:04,680 --> 00:17:06,140
in scale.

262
00:17:06,140 --> 00:17:10,540
Matt's video was reported on so extensively that it raises the question of how exactly

263
00:17:10,540 --> 00:17:12,280
it spread so far.

264
00:17:12,280 --> 00:17:16,620
As I mentioned previously, many high-profile YouTubers have covered the issue of child

265
00:17:16,620 --> 00:17:20,920
endangerment before, yet they hardly received any mainstream coverage.

266
00:17:20,920 --> 00:17:25,960
If you want to compare apples to apples, in 2018 a French YouTuber with hundreds of thousands

267
00:17:25,960 --> 00:17:30,520
of followers uploaded a video covering the same topic as Matt, with coincidentally the

268
00:17:30,520 --> 00:17:32,520
exact same hashtag.

269
00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:36,840
Why didn't this video spawn 70 articles or hit the front page of Reddit?

270
00:17:36,840 --> 00:17:38,440
What made Matt's video different?

271
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:43,140
Well, aside from the language barrier, it's highly likely that Matt Watson employed some

272
00:17:43,140 --> 00:17:47,080
rather sneaky tactics to nudge his video in the right direction.

273
00:17:47,080 --> 00:17:52,400
Matt published his video at 11.27 PM Eastern Time, which is very late in the evening by

274
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:54,080
YouTube standards.

275
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:58,520
Most YouTubers choose to upload in the afternoon or early evening so they can capitalize off

276
00:17:58,520 --> 00:18:00,360
peak internet traffic.

277
00:18:00,360 --> 00:18:05,000
Matt deliberately published his video after most people had gone to sleep, a poor strategy

278
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:10,300
for YouTube views, but a necessary strategy for what he likely had planned.

279
00:18:10,300 --> 00:18:15,280
Only 40 minutes after Matt published his video on YouTube, he posted the link to Reddit.

280
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:19,280
About 90 minutes after that, he begins live streaming on his YouTube channel where he

281
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:22,640
links his viewers to the Reddit post so that they can upvote it.

282
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:24,120
Link in the chat will upvote them.

283
00:18:24,120 --> 00:18:25,120
Yeah, that's a good idea.

284
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:26,120
Actually, you know what?

285
00:18:26,120 --> 00:18:27,120
I'm going to stay on the chat right now.

286
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:28,440
Okay guys, it's up.

287
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:37,240
So I'm going to post the link over here in the window, post, that's my post.

288
00:18:37,240 --> 00:18:39,800
So yeah, upvote that all you can.

289
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:44,340
This is a strict violation of the solicitation rule on our videos and should have led to

290
00:18:44,340 --> 00:18:45,460
the post removal.

291
00:18:45,460 --> 00:18:51,220
However, at around 1 AM on a weekday, most of the mods were probably asleep and the violation

292
00:18:51,220 --> 00:18:53,220
went completely unnoticed.

293
00:18:53,220 --> 00:18:57,800
Matt's initial karma injection was enough to push the video to the front page and after

294
00:18:57,800 --> 00:19:01,220
that point, the Reddit hive mind did the rest.

295
00:19:01,220 --> 00:19:05,540
Almost by design, the video was inundated by a furious wave of outsiders who had little

296
00:19:05,540 --> 00:19:08,200
to no understanding of how YouTube works.

297
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:19,220
And before the YouTube community could respond, the video was already too big to fail.

298
00:19:19,220 --> 00:19:23,840
The media coverage of Matt Watson's video was as dubious as any other aspect of the

299
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:24,840
controversy.

300
00:19:24,840 --> 00:19:29,460
Dozens of publications jumped on a bandwagon to elevate Matt's video as if he made a ground

301
00:19:29,460 --> 00:19:30,920
breaking discovery.

302
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:34,260
This issue had been discussed by YouTube commentators for years.

303
00:19:34,260 --> 00:19:37,340
Why did everyone decide to get outraged by it now?

304
00:19:37,340 --> 00:19:41,740
Was the word wormhole just a trigger for people to suddenly pay attention?

305
00:19:41,740 --> 00:19:46,020
Last spring I was able to discuss the issue of child predation with anxiety war, who has

306
00:19:46,020 --> 00:19:49,160
become the modern day Chris Hansen of YouTube.

307
00:19:49,160 --> 00:19:53,500
Through his years of experience in identifying and confronting predators, he identified that

308
00:19:53,500 --> 00:19:57,520
the most dangerous sites for children are instant messaging apps like Snapchat and the

309
00:19:57,520 --> 00:20:01,860
now defunct Kik, which allow predators to communicate directly with children.

310
00:20:01,860 --> 00:20:22,580
YouTube's direct message system was buried in the video manager for years, and in 2018

311
00:20:22,580 --> 00:20:24,780
they removed the feature entirely.

312
00:20:24,780 --> 00:20:29,780
Content wise, apps like Instagram and TikTok are far more dangerous for children than YouTube,

313
00:20:29,780 --> 00:20:34,060
with Instagram ranked as the leading app in giving kids depression among other psychiatric

314
00:20:34,060 --> 00:20:40,300
issues, and TikTok continually luring unaware kids to injure themselves in ridiculous challenges.

315
00:20:40,300 --> 00:20:44,780
Both of these apps also have an easily accessible instant messaging feature which allow predators

316
00:20:44,780 --> 00:20:46,840
to speak directly to minors.

317
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:51,000
As far as child endangerment goes, YouTube should be far from the top of anyone's list

318
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:55,960
of the most dangerous apps for kids, yet the media seems to treat YouTube far more harshly

319
00:20:55,960 --> 00:20:57,980
than any of these other sites.

320
00:20:57,980 --> 00:21:01,420
Apps like TikTok are often portrayed as fun and quirky.

321
00:21:01,420 --> 00:21:06,660
You never see any outrage mobs trying to incite an ad boycott of Snapchat or Instagram.

322
00:21:06,660 --> 00:21:11,260
YouTube certainly has its fair share of issues with its handling of children, but to scrutinize

323
00:21:11,260 --> 00:21:16,300
them while simultaneously ignoring far more dangerous sites is either dishonest or downright

324
00:21:16,300 --> 00:21:17,500
foolish.

325
00:21:17,500 --> 00:21:20,800
Is this all just another case of boomers being boomers?

326
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:25,460
Maybe so, but something else about the media's coverage of Matt's video is far harder to

327
00:21:25,460 --> 00:21:26,680
explain.

328
00:21:26,680 --> 00:21:32,000
Out of all 73 articles written about the controversy, not one featured any interview

329
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,280
with Matt.

330
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:37,580
Every one of the articles either cites the video itself or a different article covering

331
00:21:37,580 --> 00:21:39,080
the controversy.

332
00:21:39,080 --> 00:21:44,680
Only two out of the 73 articles even mentioned reaching out to Matt for an interview.

333
00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:49,200
This contradicts Matt's own claims of supposedly contacting media outlets himself.

334
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:53,900
I've written a report and I'm sending that report out to every news outlet that I possibly

335
00:21:53,900 --> 00:21:54,900
can.

336
00:21:54,900 --> 00:22:00,060
I get that nowadays our standards for journalistic publications are at an all-time low, but this

337
00:22:00,060 --> 00:22:01,700
is just ridiculous.

338
00:22:01,700 --> 00:22:05,820
Usually when reporting on a story, it's common practice to base it off some sort of

339
00:22:05,820 --> 00:22:11,140
credible research from a verifiable expert in their domain, not some unknown dude who

340
00:22:11,140 --> 00:22:13,100
made an angry YouTube video.

341
00:22:13,100 --> 00:22:17,880
But even in the off chance that you do decide to platform a fringe weirdo with no credentials

342
00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:22,660
whatsoever, you should at least be able to interview the guy and have him elaborate on

343
00:22:22,660 --> 00:22:25,180
his more extraordinary claims.

344
00:22:25,180 --> 00:22:29,500
Of course, most of these publications probably did reach out to Matt, which presents an even

345
00:22:29,500 --> 00:22:34,020
stranger implication that Matt Watson outright refused to be interviewed.

346
00:22:34,020 --> 00:22:36,500
You know, I just want to create some awareness for this.

347
00:22:36,500 --> 00:22:38,940
I want to try and get this hashtag trending.

348
00:22:38,940 --> 00:22:46,500
I have concealed my identity when I did it because I have emailed several news outlets,

349
00:22:46,500 --> 00:22:52,660
BuzzFeed and stuff like that.

350
00:22:52,660 --> 00:22:58,140
And so my concern with contacting the FBI or the police is that could someone like myself

351
00:22:58,140 --> 00:23:06,440
be implicated by simply sending the information to them or the recordings to them that have

352
00:23:06,440 --> 00:23:10,020
these sort of borderline thumbnails in them?

353
00:23:10,020 --> 00:23:11,740
Could I be implicated in something?

354
00:23:11,740 --> 00:23:19,060
So BuzzFeed, as an example, I can send something to them anonymously and they will protect

355
00:23:19,060 --> 00:23:20,060
my identity.

356
00:23:20,060 --> 00:23:24,340
BuzzFeed, as an example, they will protect my identity.

357
00:23:24,340 --> 00:23:28,900
So I feel like by sending it to them, you know, I've started the process here.

358
00:23:28,900 --> 00:23:30,740
We're talking about this stuff.

359
00:23:30,740 --> 00:23:32,020
Somebody's talking about Fox News.

360
00:23:32,020 --> 00:23:33,860
I don't like Fox News.

361
00:23:33,860 --> 00:23:38,240
Why would the leader of a major social movement turn down the free publicity from appearing

362
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:41,460
in dozens of articles from major publications?

363
00:23:41,460 --> 00:23:45,540
For someone seemingly so passionate about the issue, someone who claims to be just a

364
00:23:45,540 --> 00:23:50,540
concerned citizen doing the right thing, what would he have to lose by answering a few questions

365
00:23:50,540 --> 00:23:51,980
for reporters?

366
00:23:51,980 --> 00:23:55,700
All I'm doing here, dude, is I'm just trying to make some awareness about this whole thing.

367
00:23:55,700 --> 00:23:57,640
I'm just trying to create awareness for this.

368
00:23:57,640 --> 00:23:59,380
You guys are helping to create awareness for this.

369
00:23:59,380 --> 00:24:01,200
We're all creating awareness for this right now.

370
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:05,080
We have one single solitary purpose for being here right now, and that is to bring awareness

371
00:24:05,080 --> 00:24:06,080
to this issue.

372
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:07,780
Hashtag YouTube wake up.

373
00:24:07,780 --> 00:24:12,280
Anyone in Matt's position should have been fully cooperative with the media, unless,

374
00:24:12,280 --> 00:24:22,960
of course, they had something to hide.

375
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:27,280
Another aspect of the whole situation that most people missed was Matt's inconsistent

376
00:24:27,280 --> 00:24:29,840
outlook of corporate accountability.

377
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:34,500
Throughout his whole campaign, he had a remarkable ability to flip flop between a staunch opponent

378
00:24:34,500 --> 00:24:37,380
of corporate abuse to an outright bootlicker.

379
00:24:37,380 --> 00:24:42,100
Nestle was quick to pull their ads from YouTube amidst the controversy, despite undergoing

380
00:24:42,100 --> 00:24:46,840
numerous lawsuits for using child slavery to harvest their cocoa beans.

381
00:24:46,840 --> 00:24:51,760
Disney also pulled their ads over concerns of child exploitation, despite notoriously

382
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:55,960
exploiting children for years in their Chinese toy factories.

383
00:24:55,960 --> 00:25:00,400
Matt Watson seemed oblivious to all of this, as he actively aided both of these companies

384
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:03,080
in his supposed mission to help children.

385
00:25:03,080 --> 00:25:06,440
No matter who you are, no matter what your politics are, no matter what your skin color

386
00:25:06,440 --> 00:25:10,340
is, this is about protecting children, and it's intrinsic to human nature to protect

387
00:25:10,340 --> 00:25:11,340
children.

388
00:25:11,340 --> 00:25:14,980
Hey pal, you just blowing from stupid town?

389
00:25:14,980 --> 00:25:19,540
Eventually, pretty much all of these companies quietly returned to YouTube a few weeks after

390
00:25:19,540 --> 00:25:21,700
the controversy had blown over.

391
00:25:21,700 --> 00:25:25,540
Like most corporate stunts, it was all just smoke and mirrors.

392
00:25:25,540 --> 00:25:30,940
So much for boycotting child exploitation, it turns out that YouTube's proverbial wallet

393
00:25:30,940 --> 00:25:36,880
runs very deep, and $8,000 refunds aren't a steep price to pay when you make $15 billion

394
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:38,360
in annual revenue.

395
00:25:38,360 --> 00:25:42,840
Ultimately, Matt's whole plan of forcing an ad boycott amounted to nothing more than

396
00:25:42,840 --> 00:25:46,560
inconveniencing innocent creators for a few weeks.

397
00:25:46,560 --> 00:25:50,900
The advertisers predictably returned, and everything went back to normal like how it

398
00:25:50,900 --> 00:25:53,760
always does after any YouTube controversy.

399
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:58,720
Yet another example of why ad boycotts on YouTube make no sense whatsoever, and Matt's

400
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:03,540
whimsical double standard of corporate abuse was yet another example of his suspicious

401
00:26:03,540 --> 00:26:14,240
behavior.

402
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:18,340
So let's once again visit the strange topic of Matt's old videos.

403
00:26:18,340 --> 00:26:22,740
Although they were ignored by practically every major news outlet, the YouTube community

404
00:26:22,740 --> 00:26:27,340
quickly gathered them as ammunition to defend the platform from his deception.

405
00:26:27,340 --> 00:26:31,320
Some of you have probably seen this clip, where Matt allegedly harasses a girl on the

406
00:26:31,320 --> 00:26:37,480
sidewalk.

407
00:26:37,480 --> 00:26:41,920
Most YouTubers utilized this clip to reach the conclusion that Matt was an unscrupulous

408
00:26:41,920 --> 00:26:44,320
creep and a failed content creator.

409
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:49,040
However, diving deeper into Matt's past content reveals that many YouTube commentators

410
00:26:49,040 --> 00:26:51,640
had missed the greater context of his origins.

411
00:26:51,640 --> 00:26:55,960
The few mentions of his channel in articles and forum posts reveal that Matt started on

412
00:26:55,960 --> 00:26:58,660
YouTube by making Men's Health videos.

413
00:26:58,660 --> 00:27:03,980
He was perhaps most known for his NoFap vlogs, which he uploaded to the Matt's What It Is

414
00:27:03,980 --> 00:27:08,540
channel, the same account that would eventually host the YouTube Wake Up video and his subsequent

415
00:27:08,540 --> 00:27:09,540
streams.

416
00:27:09,540 --> 00:27:12,600
Matt's original account dates back to 2016.

417
00:27:12,600 --> 00:27:16,900
One year later, Matt would open up a new account called Totally Uncreative, to which he would

418
00:27:16,900 --> 00:27:23,740
upload what he described as comedy videos.

419
00:27:23,740 --> 00:27:28,240
This is the channel that spawned Matt's more questionable content, which was later circulated

420
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:33,040
by the YouTube commentators, most of whom would assume that the content was genuine.

421
00:27:33,040 --> 00:27:37,620
Matt's eventual Reddit history would contradict this theory and imply that his entire catalog

422
00:27:37,620 --> 00:27:41,880
of videos on both channels were attempts at ironic satire.

423
00:27:41,880 --> 00:27:52,540
I found myself kind of browsing through a lot of your old videos, you know, really got

424
00:27:52,540 --> 00:27:57,100
me wondering, you know, what happened, you know, you haven't posted anything in close

425
00:27:57,100 --> 00:27:58,460
to five, six months.

426
00:27:58,460 --> 00:28:03,860
And I found a comment that you had pinned, I think on your most recent video that kind

427
00:28:03,860 --> 00:28:08,460
of announced that, uh, that you were done, man, that you were, you were done with a whole

428
00:28:08,460 --> 00:28:12,560
YouTube thing and...

429
00:28:12,560 --> 00:28:18,600
Mysteriously, the old Matt's What It Is videos were archived and re-uploaded by an anonymous

430
00:28:18,600 --> 00:28:22,040
channel a week after the controversy had subsided.

431
00:28:22,040 --> 00:28:26,560
Although the nature or purpose of this channel is unknown, it is rather strange that it not

432
00:28:26,560 --> 00:28:31,480
only archived Matt's old videos prior to their sudden deletion, but chose to re-upload them

433
00:28:31,480 --> 00:28:35,000
only after they served little purpose to discredit him.

434
00:28:35,020 --> 00:28:39,700
Ultimately, Matt's old content serves as yet another wrinkle in the tapestry of confusing

435
00:28:39,700 --> 00:28:45,500
circumstances around him, and provides further reason to doubt his motives for starting the controversy.

436
00:28:51,020 --> 00:28:56,580
On February 19th, just 48 hours after arriving on the scene, Matt streamed on YouTube for

437
00:28:56,580 --> 00:28:57,840
the final time.

438
00:28:57,840 --> 00:28:58,840
So that's it, man.

439
00:28:58,840 --> 00:28:59,840
I think we're set.

440
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:00,840
Thank you all.

441
00:29:00,840 --> 00:29:05,220
Uh, you know, that's all I have to say, man.

442
00:29:05,220 --> 00:29:06,540
Peace out.

443
00:29:06,540 --> 00:29:10,500
After the stream went dark, Matt Watson disappeared from YouTube.

444
00:29:10,500 --> 00:29:14,700
The YouTube Wake Up Twitter account, which was presumably operated by Matt, remained

445
00:29:14,700 --> 00:29:18,900
active until the beginning of March before also falling dormant.

446
00:29:18,900 --> 00:29:22,840
Matt's last known online activity can be found on his Reddit account.

447
00:29:22,840 --> 00:29:28,340
On February 22nd, three days after his final stream, Matt posted a long, rambling, mostly

448
00:29:28,340 --> 00:29:32,500
incoherent comment on the newly minted YouTube Wake Up subreddit.

449
00:29:32,500 --> 00:29:37,620
In the post, he generalizes the mounting criticism as slanderous and continues to parrot the

450
00:29:37,620 --> 00:29:40,520
same rhetoric about YouTubers being greedy.

451
00:29:40,520 --> 00:29:45,660
He then goes on to sanctimoniously lecture us about the dangers of social media, presumably

452
00:29:45,660 --> 00:29:48,960
as a means of accounting for his future absence.

453
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:54,080
As of July 1st, 2019, Matt Watson has vanished from the web.

454
00:29:54,080 --> 00:29:59,240
Many details about his personal life or current whereabouts remain a mystery to this day.

455
00:29:59,240 --> 00:30:04,120
Later in 2019, the COPPA controversy once again placed YouTube's child safety standards

456
00:30:04,120 --> 00:30:05,520
in serious doubt.

457
00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:10,960
Despite COPPA providing Matt with ample incentive to return, he has thus far decided to remain

458
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:15,420
a poltergeist to the digital world, leaving the rest of us to wonder what in the world

459
00:30:15,420 --> 00:30:16,740
just happened.

460
00:30:16,740 --> 00:30:20,940
When we come back, we will discuss the alternative theories of what Matt was really trying to

461
00:30:20,940 --> 00:30:44,860
accomplish by making YouTube wake up.

462
00:30:50,940 --> 00:31:12,780
Hi, I'm Dr. Spiral, and I'm here today to talk about Keeps, the easiest and most affordable

463
00:31:12,780 --> 00:31:16,340
innovation in baldness prevention technology.

00:31:16,340 --> 00:31:20,180
Millions of men make the mistake of taking their hair for granted until it's too late.

465
00:31:20,180 --> 00:31:24,940
Once you go bald, your self-worth flies out the window faster than my medical license.

466
00:31:24,940 --> 00:31:29,300
Everyone knows that hair is the only true source of a man's power, which is why baldies

467
00:31:29,300 --> 00:31:35,620
burn through thousands on tacky wigs, smelly tonics, and painful implants.

468
00:31:35,620 --> 00:31:38,600
Keeps will help you battle baldness before it's too late.

476
00:32:02,660 --> 00:32:10,340
I can't take any more of these ad boycotts.

477
00:32:10,340 --> 00:32:14,860
The prevailing narrative regarding the YouTube wake up controversy is pretty much everything

478
00:32:14,860 --> 00:32:17,220
that was reported by the mainstream media.

479
00:32:17,220 --> 00:32:21,480
The general public assumed that Matt was simply acting as a good Samaritan and exposing the

480
00:32:21,480 --> 00:32:23,740
issue as part of his civic duty.

481
00:32:23,740 --> 00:32:27,660
Most people, especially the ones on Reddit, assumed that Matt was portraying these issues

482
00:32:27,660 --> 00:32:29,580
fairly and honestly.

483
00:32:29,580 --> 00:32:33,660
The Reddit traffic and heavy media coverage were thought to be organic and a result of

484
00:32:33,660 --> 00:32:38,100
people passionately caring about the issue by demanding accountability from YouTube.

485
00:32:38,100 --> 00:32:42,580
For those outside the YouTube scene, Matt's mission to contact advertisers seemed like

486
00:32:42,580 --> 00:32:47,600
a reasonable enough method to inspire change and the subsequent advertiser boycott came

487
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:51,300
as a logical consequence of Matt's well-intentioned campaign.

488
00:32:51,300 --> 00:32:55,660
For almost everyone aware of the controversy, this was a satisfactory explanation for the

489
00:32:55,660 --> 00:32:57,060
sequence of events.

490
00:32:57,060 --> 00:33:02,220
However, as we discussed previously, delving deeper into the details of the situation reveals

491
00:33:02,220 --> 00:33:07,340
a lot of strange inconsistencies that place the mainstream theory into serious doubt.

492
00:33:07,340 --> 00:33:12,500
The following theories will attempt to account for the most dubious discrepancies, more specifically

493
00:33:12,500 --> 00:33:17,380
analyzing Matt's behavior to deduce his true motivation for inciting the YouTube wake-up

494
00:33:17,380 --> 00:33:18,380
controversy.

495
00:33:18,380 --> 00:33:26,700
So today I was on the internet and I was looking at how to build a successful YouTube channel

496
00:33:26,700 --> 00:33:31,100
and one of the two things they recommended was to be super high energy!

497
00:33:31,100 --> 00:33:35,240
Given the sequence of events, the first theory many would consider is that Matt Watson wanted

498
00:33:35,240 --> 00:33:38,380
to get revenge on the platform for some unknown reason.

499
00:33:38,380 --> 00:33:43,080
Based on his apparent hatred for YouTube specifically and his unwillingness to cooperate

500
00:33:43,080 --> 00:33:49,580
with YouTubers in any capacity.

501
00:33:49,580 --> 00:33:54,680
The crux of this theory comes from the inconsistency of Matt's overall knowledge of the platform.

502
00:33:54,680 --> 00:33:59,700
He had no problem setting up a live stream, but claimed to have no idea how to edit monetization

503
00:33:59,700 --> 00:34:08,140
settings.

504
00:34:08,140 --> 00:34:13,040
He seemed very familiar with watching certain channels, but somehow neglected obvious examples

505
00:34:13,040 --> 00:34:17,280
of those same YouTubers supporting the cause he claimed to represent.

506
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:21,700
Even though Matt's behavior reflected someone with years of experience on the platform,

507
00:34:21,700 --> 00:34:26,420
he would frequently play dumb to his audience, acting ignorant to very basic features on

508
00:34:26,420 --> 00:34:33,260
the site.

509
00:34:33,260 --> 00:34:37,980
Of course, many commentators would eventually expose that Matt did, in fact, spend at least

510
00:34:37,980 --> 00:34:43,260
two years making content before the controversy, content which he deliberately tried to obfuscate

511
00:34:43,260 --> 00:34:44,700
from public view.

512
00:34:44,700 --> 00:34:48,940
Much of YouTube's commentary community seemed to reach the consensus that Matt Watson was

513
00:34:48,940 --> 00:35:01,900
a failed YouTuber who manufactured the controversy for views and attention.

514
00:35:01,900 --> 00:35:06,700
After spending years trying and failing to grow his channel, Matt began to resent YouTube

515
00:35:06,700 --> 00:35:11,060
and its more successful creators, with that resentment eventually boiling over into a

516
00:35:11,060 --> 00:35:12,540
full-on vendetta.

517
00:35:12,540 --> 00:35:17,860
Eventually, he hatched a plan to sabotage the platform and its greedy creators.

518
00:35:17,860 --> 00:35:22,100
YouTube Wake Up was a result of Matt actively seeking revenge on YouTube.

519
00:35:22,100 --> 00:35:27,140
While the rogue YouTuber theory may explain Matt's abrasive attitude towards other creators,

520
00:35:27,140 --> 00:35:30,060
it doesn't account for many other discrepancies.

521
00:35:30,060 --> 00:35:34,620
First of all, the commentator consensus that Matt manufactured the controversy for fame

522
00:35:34,620 --> 00:35:39,500
doesn't hold up when you factor in his subsequent disappearance from the internet as a whole.

523
00:35:39,500 --> 00:35:44,540
Matt clearly acted with grander motivations than simply furthering his own status.

524
00:35:44,540 --> 00:35:49,060
Additionally, this theory creates inconsistencies with Matt's level of competence throughout

525
00:35:49,060 --> 00:35:50,540
the whole process.

526
00:35:50,540 --> 00:35:54,700
Are we supposed to believe that Matt is capable of manipulating thousands of people to do

527
00:35:54,700 --> 00:35:59,060
his bidding, but he can't figure out how to make people watch his YouTube videos?

528
00:35:59,060 --> 00:36:03,300
If he knew how to exploit Reddit Karma to boost his viewership, why not just use that

529
00:36:03,300 --> 00:36:05,860
tactic on his existing content?

530
00:36:05,860 --> 00:36:10,420
This theory paints Matt as a failed YouTuber who grew disillusioned with the platform,

531
00:36:10,420 --> 00:36:15,100
yet he gained almost 20,000 subscribers and more than a million total views in just two

532
00:36:15,100 --> 00:36:20,260
years of making videos, which is far more successful than most channels at that point.

533
00:36:20,260 --> 00:36:25,020
With that being said, his apparent motive for hating YouTube appears much more flimsy,

534
00:36:25,020 --> 00:36:29,240
suggesting that he had a different incentive than just getting revenge on the popular kids.

535
00:36:29,240 --> 00:36:33,540
And even if he did start the controversy because he hated the platform, why was his

536
00:36:33,540 --> 00:36:36,600
campaign so successful in particular?

537
00:36:36,600 --> 00:36:40,780
Every year, dozens of videos come out seeking to expose YouTube's dirty dealings to the

538
00:36:40,780 --> 00:36:42,200
general public.

539
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:47,520
And so far, Matt's video stands alone as the only YouTube expose to garner significant

540
00:36:47,520 --> 00:36:49,280
mainstream attention.

541
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:51,900
Was it all a coincidence or just dumb luck?

542
00:36:51,900 --> 00:36:56,360
Could be either, but it's far more likely that a few hidden entities had vested interest

543
00:36:56,360 --> 00:36:58,480
in Matt's video succeeding.

544
00:36:58,480 --> 00:37:02,840
I am once again asking for your financial support.

545
00:37:02,840 --> 00:37:06,400
In leftist communities online, there's been a fixation at how YouTube's algorithm has

546
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:08,120
promoted right-wing content.

547
00:37:08,120 --> 00:37:12,640
Many argue that YouTube has inadvertently created a pipeline in which viewers are recommended

548
00:37:12,640 --> 00:37:15,680
political content that gradually radicalizes them.

549
00:37:15,680 --> 00:37:19,400
So you'll start with one or two videos of a red-haired college feminist and end up on

550
00:37:19,400 --> 00:37:21,840
videos about demographic replacement.

551
00:37:21,840 --> 00:37:25,800
This is the thesis of ideas like the PewDiePie pipeline as well as the motivation for them

552
00:37:25,800 --> 00:37:27,840
to produce their own content.

553
00:37:27,840 --> 00:37:31,900
While Matt's video predates the PewDiePie pipeline, this asserted rabbit hole was covered

554
00:37:31,900 --> 00:37:36,280
extensively in a research paper by Rebecca Lewis for Data and Society.

555
00:37:36,280 --> 00:37:41,080
Published in September of 2018, the abstract summarizes their view of YouTube rather well.

556
00:37:41,080 --> 00:37:44,720
YouTube is a principal online news source for young people, which is why it's concerning

557
00:37:44,720 --> 00:37:49,320
that YouTube, a subsidiary of Google, has become the single most important hub by which

558
00:37:49,320 --> 00:37:53,720
an extensive network of far-right influencers profit from broadcasting propaganda to young

559
00:37:53,720 --> 00:37:54,760
viewers.

560
00:37:54,760 --> 00:37:58,920
This study received not just news coverage, but was also the foundation for this video

561
00:37:58,920 --> 00:38:03,680
by YouTuber Three Arrows, which has since accumulated nearly 1 million views.

562
00:38:03,680 --> 00:38:06,080
How is this relevant to Matt Watson, you may ask?

563
00:38:06,080 --> 00:38:10,520
Well, nearly one month after Matt Watson swore to never return again, he made a reappearance

564
00:38:10,520 --> 00:38:11,520
on Reddit.

565
00:38:11,520 --> 00:38:14,700
YouTube's algorithm is the mirror of its average user.

566
00:38:14,700 --> 00:38:17,080
Start with PewDiePie and with F*****.

567
00:38:17,080 --> 00:38:19,400
Start with Joe Rogan and with Shapiro.

568
00:38:19,400 --> 00:38:22,120
Start with news and with the F*****.

569
00:38:22,120 --> 00:38:25,980
Less than two months later, Matt Watson posted again in the subreddit, this time in a thread

570
00:38:25,980 --> 00:38:27,520
calling for action.

571
00:38:27,520 --> 00:38:28,520
Its title reads,

572
00:38:28,520 --> 00:38:30,040
Turn off your ad blocker.

573
00:38:30,040 --> 00:38:31,520
Go to f****** subreddits.

574
00:38:31,520 --> 00:38:34,200
Take screenshots of ads next to f****** content.

575
00:38:34,200 --> 00:38:37,920
Send the screenshots to companies and ask why they're promoting f******ism.

576
00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:39,800
Matt Watson simply commented on this post,

577
00:38:39,800 --> 00:38:43,260
Yup, I can attest that this strategy works.

578
00:38:43,260 --> 00:38:46,080
There are a number of reasons as to why this is significant.

579
00:38:46,080 --> 00:38:50,720
Firstly, one has to remember that at this point, Matt had already essentially been forgotten.

580
00:38:50,720 --> 00:38:55,680
No one seemed to recognize him when he commented, even though he referenced his grand accomplishment.

581
00:38:55,680 --> 00:39:00,280
So one should view this as his mask off moment, how he behaves when he's no longer in the

582
00:39:00,280 --> 00:39:01,680
public's eye.

583
00:39:01,680 --> 00:39:05,180
But you also have to take this into consideration with the context of his content before the

584
00:39:05,180 --> 00:39:06,880
YouTube wake up scandal.

585
00:39:06,880 --> 00:39:11,600
On his comedy channel, he made videos mocking the Manosphere, where he would parody f******

586
00:39:11,600 --> 00:39:12,700
pickup artists.

587
00:39:12,700 --> 00:39:17,160
He clearly had a vested interest in opposing these fringe communities, and these comments

588
00:39:17,160 --> 00:39:21,120
reveal that he views ad boycotts as a proportionate response to them.

589
00:39:21,120 --> 00:39:24,760
So it's not out of the realm of possibility that he had an ulterior motive.

590
00:39:24,760 --> 00:39:28,800
Additionally, it provides an explanation for his disdain of other YouTubers.

591
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:31,760
He comments on a thread mocking Boogie2988,

592
00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:33,760
YouTube and its content creators are one and the same.

593
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:36,040
They only give a f*** about money.

594
00:39:36,040 --> 00:39:37,040
Enforcing policies?

595
00:39:37,040 --> 00:39:38,040
Nah.

596
00:39:38,040 --> 00:39:42,120
These content creators are such self-centered pieces of trash, there is a direct correlation

597
00:39:42,120 --> 00:39:45,800
between how garbage their content is and how frequently you'll find them wincing about

598
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:48,560
SJW boogie men coming for their adsense.

599
00:39:48,560 --> 00:39:53,160
Remember, when he first released his video, he framed himself as an outsider.

600
00:39:53,160 --> 00:39:56,880
But as that facade began to slip away, he revealed that he was fairly knowledgeable

601
00:39:56,880 --> 00:40:01,280
about the commentary community.

602
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:05,440
What this tells us about Matt is that going into the controversy, he was familiar with

603
00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:07,440
the YouTubers he was screwing over.

604
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:12,000
And surprise surprise, most of them are associated with the anti-SJW rabbit hole.

605
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:15,760
Many have interpreted Matt as simply not understanding the collateral damage he was going to cause.

606
00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:20,040
But since he's acknowledged both their past and present influence, he can't claim

607
00:40:20,040 --> 00:40:21,040
ignorance.

608
00:40:21,040 --> 00:40:24,480
And this, by proxy, sheds a doubt on his stated motivations.

609
00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:28,840
It's now entirely plausible that he could have been concern trolling, inciting a PR

610
00:40:28,840 --> 00:40:33,760
disaster under false pretenses to undercut the financial earnings of propagandists.

611
00:40:33,760 --> 00:40:37,240
And then, after it was all said and done, he could sit back and laugh as they've all

612
00:40:37,240 --> 00:40:42,520
been relegated to becoming Uber drivers.

613
00:40:42,520 --> 00:40:46,080
Money at his post from before the controversy revealed that it was Jordan Peterson that

614
00:40:46,080 --> 00:40:49,080
led him to broaden his focus from just the manosphere.

615
00:40:49,080 --> 00:40:55,000
Sometimes it feels like the f***ing manosphere anti-SJW types permeate every corner of YouTube.

616
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:59,040
It seems like no matter what video I watch, the comments are infected with angry s***lords

617
00:40:59,040 --> 00:41:03,600
whining about feminism, liberals, and or whatever minority group they can scapegoat for the

618
00:41:03,600 --> 00:41:04,600
world's woes.

619
00:41:04,600 --> 00:41:06,440
It's f***ing depressing.

620
00:41:06,440 --> 00:41:10,040
At this point, it's worth clarifying that if all this is true, Matt had an extremely

621
00:41:10,040 --> 00:41:11,320
flawed plan.

622
00:41:11,320 --> 00:41:16,400
By broadly attacking all content creators, he skewered not just right-wingers, but LGBT

623
00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:17,800
creators and leftists.

624
00:41:17,800 --> 00:41:21,880
Remember, YouTube is a platform where pretty much anyone can upload videos.

625
00:41:21,880 --> 00:41:26,560
This makes it an invaluable tool for financially unstable people to have a voice.

626
00:41:26,560 --> 00:41:30,440
As YouTube becomes less sustainable as a job, the people being affected the most are the

627
00:41:30,440 --> 00:41:32,440
ones who can't afford to do it anymore.

628
00:41:32,440 --> 00:41:36,320
If Matt's intention was to combat right-wing pundits, the best way to avoid this collateral

629
00:41:36,320 --> 00:41:38,840
damage would have been to fight them using the algorithm.

630
00:41:38,880 --> 00:41:43,040
Instead, he chose to do the more woke thing of pandering to millionaire ad agencies.

631
00:41:43,040 --> 00:41:47,120
But with all that said, the uncertainty of this theory and his general incompetence makes

632
00:41:47,120 --> 00:41:48,640
it impossible to confirm.

633
00:41:48,640 --> 00:41:52,560
Sure, he was celebrating his victory after the fact, but he always stopped short of saying

634
00:41:52,560 --> 00:41:53,560
he did it intentionally.

635
00:41:53,560 --> 00:41:56,840
And it's not like he wasn't aware of the leftists he was going to hurt.

636
00:41:56,840 --> 00:42:00,920
Prior to the controversy, he'd advised an aspiring left-wing creator to only do it for

637
00:42:00,920 --> 00:42:03,240
fun, because it didn't pay like it used to.

638
00:42:03,240 --> 00:42:06,920
And throughout all his messages, despite posting in a leftist community, he never seems to

639
00:42:06,920 --> 00:42:08,520
talk about class.

640
00:42:08,520 --> 00:42:13,280
So maybe it's possible that Matt wasn't motivated by feelings of class solidarity.

641
00:42:13,280 --> 00:42:16,960
Maybe he did have ulterior motives, but ones that were even more covert than his Reddit

642
00:42:16,960 --> 00:42:18,280
account let on.

643
00:42:18,280 --> 00:42:22,600
What if Matt Watson wasn't trying to be a proletariat hero, but instead the exact

644
00:42:22,600 --> 00:42:24,760
opposite, a corporate shill?

645
00:42:30,200 --> 00:42:34,320
One of the strangest aspects about Matt that has thus far gone unexplained is the lack

646
00:42:34,320 --> 00:42:37,560
of any substantial information about his identity.

647
00:42:37,600 --> 00:42:42,160
Aside from those who deliberately remain anonymous, nearly all leaders of social movements have

648
00:42:42,160 --> 00:42:46,420
some sort of paper trail that reveal aspects about their personal lives.

649
00:42:46,420 --> 00:42:49,740
As far as we know, Matt Watson is a blank slate.

650
00:42:49,740 --> 00:42:54,180
How can this be the case for someone who spent days openly broadcasting his name and face

651
00:42:54,180 --> 00:42:56,120
for the whole world to see?

652
00:42:56,120 --> 00:42:59,960
Throughout all this exposure, you'd think that at least one YouTuber or one Redditor

653
00:42:59,960 --> 00:43:05,140
or one newsreader would know the guy in person and be able to divulge any sort of details

654
00:43:05,140 --> 00:43:06,720
about his identity.

655
00:43:06,720 --> 00:43:11,520
All this seems extraordinarily bizarre until you consider the possibility that Matt Watson,

656
00:43:11,520 --> 00:43:14,400
as we know him, doesn't actually exist.

657
00:43:14,400 --> 00:43:19,720
Each spring, media companies and advertisers hold annual meetings called Upfronts.

658
00:43:19,720 --> 00:43:23,900
Upfronts were originally used by television networks to partition and sell commercial

659
00:43:23,900 --> 00:43:26,440
time for brands to market their products.

660
00:43:26,440 --> 00:43:31,240
Eventually, Upfronts expanded to the digital space, and companies now use these meetings

661
00:43:31,240 --> 00:43:34,880
to determine their online marketing budget for the upcoming year.

662
00:43:34,880 --> 00:43:39,280
YouTube has typically hosted their Upfront in the first week of May, but Upfront negotiations

663
00:43:39,280 --> 00:43:42,580
across all networks span into the beginning of March.

664
00:43:42,580 --> 00:43:46,980
This time frame is significant to our theory because it indicates that brands must outline

665
00:43:46,980 --> 00:43:51,180
their tentative advertising budgets by the end of February, the time period that just

666
00:43:51,180 --> 00:43:54,000
so happens to align with YouTube Wake Up.

667
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:57,720
It also happens to align with another infamous YouTube controversy.

668
00:43:57,720 --> 00:44:03,140
In February 2017, Wall Street Journal reporter Jack Nikas would co-publish an article accusing

669
00:44:03,140 --> 00:44:05,500
PewDiePie of antisemitism.

670
00:44:05,500 --> 00:44:10,340
Much like Matt Watson's campaign, the Wall Street Journal seemingly manufactured a controversy

671
00:44:10,340 --> 00:44:11,740
out of thin air.

672
00:44:11,740 --> 00:44:16,340
Much like Matt's video, the article was manipulative and deceptive, and also featured

673
00:44:16,340 --> 00:44:21,540
a strange emphasis on advertisers as well as YouTube's supposed responsibility to

674
00:44:21,540 --> 00:44:23,700
micromanage its creators.

675
00:44:23,700 --> 00:44:28,900
One month later, Jack Nikas would target advertisers head-on by using a singular screenshot to

676
00:44:28,900 --> 00:44:32,000
accuse YouTube of running ads on racist content.

677
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:37,220
He would curiously omit a key detail that the video was monetized not by the uploader,

678
00:44:37,220 --> 00:44:39,440
but by a music copyright claim.

679
00:44:39,440 --> 00:44:43,960
Rather than blame the music companies, who frequently operate above the law on YouTube,

680
00:44:43,960 --> 00:44:49,040
Nikas would instead blame YouTube itself and instigate the first adpocalypse.

681
00:44:49,040 --> 00:44:53,360
In the following months, YouTube would implement sweeping changes to the revenue system on

682
00:44:53,360 --> 00:44:58,920
the site, most notably mass demonetization, introduction of the hidden channel rating

683
00:44:58,920 --> 00:45:02,240
volume, and the subsequent suppression of edgy content.

684
00:45:02,240 --> 00:45:06,260
A tremendous impact, all from a single misleading article.

685
00:45:06,260 --> 00:45:10,440
If you're noticing a pattern here, it's probably that springtime on YouTube is starting

686
00:45:10,440 --> 00:45:15,200
to bring a vigorous bloom of dubious controversy and advertiser boycotts.

687
00:45:15,200 --> 00:45:18,480
Do you think it's possible that these two prickly plants may have sprouted from the

688
00:45:18,480 --> 00:45:19,920
same seed?

689
00:45:19,920 --> 00:45:24,040
It's possible that Matt Watson was no ordinary garden variety plant.

690
00:45:24,040 --> 00:45:28,640
He may very well have been an industry plant, a fulcrum through which brands attempted to

691
00:45:28,640 --> 00:45:31,200
leverage cheaper ad rates on YouTube.

692
00:45:31,200 --> 00:45:35,840
The entire ad boycott was just a smokescreen for companies to renegotiate their existing

693
00:45:35,840 --> 00:45:39,520
contracts with YouTube and return at a lower rate.

694
00:45:39,520 --> 00:45:45,000
At the time of the YouTube wake-up controversy, many companies had ample incentive to do so.

695
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:49,560
Ever since the first adpocalypse, YouTube had been secretly subsidizing numerous brand

696
00:45:49,560 --> 00:45:54,440
safety agencies, third-party companies who worked with major corporate clients to ensure

697
00:45:54,440 --> 00:45:58,200
that their ads would not appear alongside questionable content.

698
00:45:58,200 --> 00:46:02,760
In hopes of enticing major brands back to the platform, YouTube essentially refunded

699
00:46:02,760 --> 00:46:07,480
the charges of these third-party services so brands could access them for free.

700
00:46:07,480 --> 00:46:12,160
At the end of 2018, YouTube disclosed that they would no longer be footing the bill and

701
00:46:12,160 --> 00:46:16,560
that advertisers would now have to pay for brand safety services on their own.

702
00:46:16,560 --> 00:46:21,360
This announcement frustrated both the third-party services and their clients, who now both faced

703
00:46:21,360 --> 00:46:24,040
unexpected budgetary complications.

704
00:46:24,040 --> 00:46:27,740
You have to imagine that heading into the new year, some of them were looking to recoup

705
00:46:27,740 --> 00:46:29,080
their losses.

706
00:46:29,080 --> 00:46:33,640
On February 6th, Business Insider published an article revealing that YouTube was no longer

707
00:46:33,640 --> 00:46:36,380
subsidizing brand safety agencies.

708
00:46:36,380 --> 00:46:41,420
Just 11 days later, Matt Watson would initiate the YouTube wake-up controversy while heavily

709
00:46:41,420 --> 00:46:44,560
emphasizing that YouTube is unsafe for brands.

710
00:46:44,560 --> 00:46:47,780
But I have multiple examples of big-name brands.

711
00:46:47,780 --> 00:46:50,900
We're talking Dodge Ram, Disney in one video.

712
00:46:50,900 --> 00:46:56,600
I can't imagine what these brands are going to say about their content appearing on these

713
00:46:56,600 --> 00:46:57,600
kinds of videos.

714
00:46:57,600 --> 00:46:59,240
Think about the consequences of this.

715
00:46:59,240 --> 00:47:01,300
You have a Disney advert.

716
00:47:01,300 --> 00:47:07,640
You have a McDonald's advert appearing on a video where a creep is time-stamping a little

717
00:47:07,640 --> 00:47:08,640
girl.

718
00:47:08,640 --> 00:47:14,120
If news outlets start reporting this and brands like McDonald's find out that their advertising

719
00:47:14,120 --> 00:47:22,360
is appearing on these videos, YouTube will do something.

720
00:47:22,360 --> 00:47:26,080
There's no denying that these companies have incredible reach and influence.

721
00:47:26,560 --> 00:47:30,160
The Amazon slate was notably partnered with GroupM, the largest advertising company in

722
00:47:30,160 --> 00:47:34,840
the world, and one that claims to be responsible for a third of all ads broadcasted.

723
00:47:34,840 --> 00:47:39,080
They certainly have the means to pull some strings in the mainstream media, especially

724
00:47:39,080 --> 00:47:43,580
in an age where news outlets have been revealed to be increasingly corrupt.

725
00:47:43,580 --> 00:47:48,340
These days, most news agendas are determined not by what's newsworthy, but by what's profitable

726
00:47:48,340 --> 00:47:53,760
for those running the show, and YouTube wake-up sought to make many companies a lot of money.

727
00:47:53,760 --> 00:47:57,440
This theory explains how Matt's campaign got so much coverage.

728
00:47:57,440 --> 00:48:01,440
The brands had always been planning to pull out, they just needed an angry activist to

729
00:48:01,440 --> 00:48:03,520
provide them with the opportunity.

730
00:48:03,520 --> 00:48:07,000
It's possible that the key to solving the mystery of Matt Watson may have been hiding

731
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:09,200
in plain sight this whole time.

732
00:48:09,200 --> 00:48:13,720
This whole thing was never about protecting kids, some brands even admitted it.

733
00:48:13,720 --> 00:48:17,680
Practically all of them eventually returned to YouTube, likely at a cheaper rate than

734
00:48:17,680 --> 00:48:18,800
before.

735
00:48:18,800 --> 00:48:24,800
As for Matt, well, as far as we know, his entire channel, story, and persona is a fabrication.

736
00:48:24,800 --> 00:48:29,320
The reason we can't find anything on his identity is that Matt Watson, as we know him, doesn't

737
00:48:29,320 --> 00:48:30,680
actually exist.

738
00:48:30,680 --> 00:48:35,600
Matt Watson was just the alias of a covert agent, hired to do a very specific job by

739
00:48:35,600 --> 00:48:37,280
an unknown entity.

740
00:48:37,280 --> 00:48:41,320
Once he accomplished his mission, he no longer had any reason to stick around.

741
00:48:41,320 --> 00:48:46,920
Uh, in the description, I've included all the social media contact information for every

742
00:48:46,920 --> 00:48:53,400
brand that appears in my video, and I've included a timestamp for where exactly that

743
00:48:53,400 --> 00:48:54,880
brand appears in my video.

744
00:48:54,880 --> 00:49:00,520
Uh, in the description, I've included all the social media contact information for every

745
00:49:00,520 --> 00:49:07,400
brand.

746
00:49:07,400 --> 00:49:12,480
Of course, like the other theories, the industry plant hypothesis doesn't account for everything.

747
00:49:12,480 --> 00:49:17,200
If Matt really was a hired agent, then how could you explain his older content?

748
00:49:17,200 --> 00:49:21,280
It seems rather ridiculous to suggest that he was planning this stunt for more than two

749
00:49:21,280 --> 00:49:22,280
years.

750
00:49:22,280 --> 00:49:26,900
If the advertisers needed an unsuspecting plant to orchestrate a controversy, then why

751
00:49:26,900 --> 00:49:31,860
select one with any sort of history attached to his account, especially one with history

752
00:49:31,860 --> 00:49:34,280
as bizarre as Matt's old content?

753
00:49:34,280 --> 00:49:39,280
Additionally, as with any conspiracy containing a ton of moving parts, this theory potentially

754
00:49:39,280 --> 00:49:42,400
involves a lot of people that would need to be kept quiet.

755
00:49:42,400 --> 00:49:47,280
And finally, if it was really that easy for companies to take advantage of YouTube, shouldn't

756
00:49:47,280 --> 00:49:51,080
we have seen a bunch of Matt Watsons popping up all over the place?

757
00:49:51,080 --> 00:49:58,080
At least for now, that remains to be seen.

758
00:49:58,080 --> 00:50:07,920
Unfortunately, we may never know Matt Watson's true intentions with the YouTube Wake Up campaign.

759
00:50:07,920 --> 00:50:12,080
At the end of the day, all of our theories are nothing more than educated guesses and

760
00:50:12,080 --> 00:50:16,760
unless we get some serious testimony from any of the parties involved, all we can do

761
00:50:16,760 --> 00:50:18,400
is wonder.

762
00:50:18,400 --> 00:50:23,140
Speculation aside, it is fairly evident from the facts of the case that we should be skeptical

763
00:50:23,140 --> 00:50:26,680
of Matt Watson's self-proclaimed mission to protect children.

764
00:50:26,680 --> 00:50:30,800
The circumstances surrounding his behavior were too suspicious and contradictory for

765
00:50:30,800 --> 00:50:33,200
us to buy into the official narrative.

766
00:50:33,200 --> 00:50:38,120
It's obvious that Matt had some hidden agenda, but what exactly that agenda was may forever

767
00:50:38,120 --> 00:50:39,800
remain up for debate.

768
00:50:39,800 --> 00:50:43,360
One thing for certain is that the fulfillment of Matt's agenda came at the expense of

769
00:50:43,360 --> 00:50:45,740
both YouTube and its creators.

770
00:50:45,740 --> 00:50:50,480
The meteoric success of YouTube Wake Up may be indicative of changing tides in the digital

771
00:50:50,480 --> 00:50:51,520
landscape.

772
00:50:51,520 --> 00:50:55,720
The controversy likely represents one of the mounting consequences of YouTube's de facto

773
00:50:55,720 --> 00:50:59,220
monopoly on long-form user-generated content.

774
00:50:59,220 --> 00:51:03,580
As the site continues to scale beyond the limits of human control, the platform will

775
00:51:03,580 --> 00:51:06,660
keep finding itself in more precarious positions.

776
00:51:06,660 --> 00:51:10,260
These days it's more than just creators who are growing increasingly frustrated by

777
00:51:10,260 --> 00:51:11,900
their lack of options.

778
00:51:11,900 --> 00:51:16,300
With billions in corporate transactions on the line, YouTube is under more pressure than

779
00:51:16,300 --> 00:51:18,760
ever to perform to a certain standard.

780
00:51:18,760 --> 00:51:23,340
In the future, YouTube may further transform into a battleground between clashing corporate

781
00:51:23,340 --> 00:51:27,100
titans while the rest of us are just along for the ride.

782
00:51:27,100 --> 00:51:31,700
Ultimately, Matt Watson exposed YouTube's most confounding issue of all.

783
00:51:31,700 --> 00:51:35,380
Not their lack of child safety, but their lack of communication.

784
00:51:35,380 --> 00:51:39,740
Perhaps the biggest factor that made YouTube Wake Up so successful was YouTube's complete

785
00:51:39,740 --> 00:51:44,140
failure to inform the public on hardly anything happening on the platform.

786
00:51:44,140 --> 00:51:48,220
YouTube is a site that likes to shroud itself in a cloud of mystery so that they can operate

787
00:51:48,220 --> 00:51:51,080
invisibly to the prying public eye.

788
00:51:51,080 --> 00:51:55,560
They thrive within an information vacuum, leaving the general public totally ignorant

789
00:51:55,560 --> 00:51:58,300
to even the site's most basic features.

790
00:51:58,300 --> 00:52:03,240
It was this ignorance which Matt Watson exploited to transform a simple expose into one of the

791
00:52:03,240 --> 00:52:06,200
biggest controversies the site had ever seen.

792
00:52:06,200 --> 00:52:10,800
His blatant dishonesty should have been immediately debunked, yet it was only detected by the

793
00:52:10,800 --> 00:52:13,360
most savvy creators on the platform.

794
00:52:13,360 --> 00:52:18,520
The vast majority of observers accepted Matt's emotionally charged rhetoric as the truth,

795
00:52:18,520 --> 00:52:20,760
and YouTube paid the price.

796
00:52:20,760 --> 00:52:22,240
Honesty is a two-way street.

797
00:52:22,240 --> 00:52:26,360
The more you hide from the public, the less likely they are to trust you.

798
00:52:26,360 --> 00:52:32,280
After burning so many of us for so long, it's hard for anybody to trust YouTube these days.

799
00:52:32,280 --> 00:52:36,800
YouTube Wake Up serves as the ultimate indictment to the site's severe transparency issue.

800
00:52:36,800 --> 00:52:41,440
It also serves as an indictment against the site's total lack of direction or leadership.

801
00:52:41,440 --> 00:52:45,780
It's safe to say that over the past half-decade, YouTube's internal decision-making can only

802
00:52:45,780 --> 00:52:47,600
be described as hapless.

803
00:52:47,600 --> 00:52:52,000
Whether it's their persistently baffling and unwanted policy changes, their totally

804
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:56,340
inconsistent enforcement of the rules, or their preferential treatment for the vapid

805
00:52:56,340 --> 00:53:01,360
celebrities at the top of the site, many of YouTube's issues are completely self-imposed,

806
00:53:01,360 --> 00:53:05,520
brought about mostly by their inability to think proactively about future obstacles.

807
00:53:05,520 --> 00:53:09,920
Lately, the direction of the site seems about as coherent as a headless chicken, like how

808
00:53:09,920 --> 00:53:14,560
YouTube has spent the past five years dedicating an entire section of the site to kindergartners

809
00:53:14,560 --> 00:53:20,320
only to scramble and panic when, shockingly, targeting them with ads was against the law.

810
00:53:20,320 --> 00:53:24,460
Much of YouTube's aimlessness could be attributed to their pitifully weak leadership.

811
00:53:24,460 --> 00:53:29,000
In the event of a crisis like the Matt Watson controversy, most YouTubers have nowhere to

812
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:30,880
turn for news and guidance.

813
00:53:30,880 --> 00:53:34,880
Who is supposed to be YouTube's spokesperson in situations like these?

814
00:53:34,880 --> 00:53:37,640
The anonymous Team YouTube Twitter account?

815
00:53:37,640 --> 00:53:40,680
Susan with her bi-annual blog posts?

816
00:53:40,680 --> 00:53:45,880
How is it that a guy like Matt Watson, a single angry dude in his bedroom, is a more effective

817
00:53:45,880 --> 00:53:49,120
leader and communicator than anyone at YouTube?

818
00:53:49,120 --> 00:53:53,280
YouTube Wake Up once again proves that unless the platform makes some major changes in their

819
00:53:53,280 --> 00:53:57,280
management, they will continue to get eaten alive by companies who know they can get away

820
00:53:57,280 --> 00:53:58,280
with it.

821
00:53:58,280 --> 00:54:02,820
Until YouTube's administration can learn to effectively communicate its goals and solutions

822
00:54:02,820 --> 00:54:07,480
to the greater public, cowardly decision-making will continue to threaten the stability of

823
00:54:07,480 --> 00:54:08,480
the site.

824
00:54:08,480 --> 00:54:13,040
In the future, we may either look back on Matt Watson as an anomaly or as the beginning

825
00:54:13,040 --> 00:54:15,240
of a far more sinister trend.

826
00:54:15,240 --> 00:54:19,280
I'm sure that every creator would hope that controversies like YouTube Wake Up remain

827
00:54:19,280 --> 00:54:20,640
in the past.

828
00:54:20,640 --> 00:54:25,640
Matt Watson sparked a wave of rage and disgust by supposedly uncovering a wormhole.

829
00:54:25,640 --> 00:54:29,880
Nobody realized that the real wormhole would be the mystery behind Matt himself.

830
00:54:29,880 --> 00:54:34,640
Whoever he was and whatever he was doing here, Matt Watson will go down as YouTube's most

831
00:54:34,640 --> 00:54:35,920
infamous red herring.

832
00:55:15,240 --> 00:55:24,720
Thanks for watching.
