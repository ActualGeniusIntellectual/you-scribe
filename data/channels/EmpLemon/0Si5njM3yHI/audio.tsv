0	22180	I get asked all the time why I watch sports, and to tell you the truth, the thrill of competition
22180	35140	comes down to two very simple things, the euphoria of victory and the agony of defeat.
35140	42400	A wise man once said, you play to win the game, a quotation so blunt that many may find
42400	48060	it humorous, but if you look past the literal denotation of the statement, it serves more
48060	52980	to punctuate the harsh reality of what it truly means to compete.
52980	56700	When you get right down to it, sports are brutal.
56700	61820	After you strip away all the fame and fortune of being a professional athlete, history only
61820	67700	cares about two things, how much you won and how much you lost.
67700	72660	As sports fans, we often like to craft little narratives around players and teams, feel
72660	76660	good stories to make them seem a bit more like a protagonist.
76660	82420	In this day and age, everyone's looking for a hero, and unfortunately, this is the point
82420	85420	where sports deviates from fiction.
85420	89600	Because at the end of the day, when all the chips are down, it doesn't matter how much
89600	95620	you tried, how far you came or how well you treated everyone else, all will be forgotten
95620	97800	if you fail to win.
97800	103060	And unfortunately for our heroes, there's just not a lot of winning to go around.
103060	109100	The vast majority of competitors are doomed to retire as nothing more than forgotten losers.
109100	112520	But not every loser is necessarily forgettable.
112520	118540	As it turns out, there are many ways to lose in sports, some more spectacular than others.
118540	123580	You can throw a game on purpose, get cheated out of a win by the refs, or get blown out
123580	128100	so badly that it makes everyone question what game you were even playing.
128140	133900	However, if you truly want to be remembered in defeat, look no further than the most painful
133900	137180	way to lose in all of sports, the choke.
158100	172840	In 1990, the International Atomic Energy Agency introduced a tiered scale for the purpose
172840	176480	of categorizing the severity of nuclear meltdowns.
176480	181440	For the purpose of this video, I believe that a similar scale is apropos for chronicling
181440	184460	the worst meltdowns in sports.
184460	188520	Watching these moments unfold is truly a surreal experience.
188520	193180	There's something about it that's so morbid yet compelling, like witnessing a train wreck
193180	194780	in slow motion.
194780	200220	To have victory within your grasp just to let it slip away, it evokes strange feelings
200220	202240	of existential dread.
202240	205900	But alas, not all chokes are created equal.
205900	208920	Some are much more dreadful than others.
208920	211180	Let's start off with the least dreadful.
215020	219260	The fundamental building block of every choke is the common blooper.
219260	223900	Professional athletes are among the best of the best in strength, speed, and skill, but
223900	227300	they're still susceptible to the occasional malfunction.
227300	232700	If you play for long enough, you will eventually be served your fair share of humble pie.
232700	237660	While the average blooper is often forgotten, a few manage to stand the test of time for
237660	239660	their sheer absurdity.
239660	245060	Jose Canseco was a baseball player who wasn't exactly known for using his head.
245060	250140	That was until a 1993 game, when a lucky bounce off the cranium helped to score what may have
250140	253820	been the only dome run in the history of the majors.
253820	258500	It's unclear whether this moment was more embarrassing than what happened to Larry Walker,
258500	262300	who forgot how to count to three in the middle of a 1994 game.
262300	265980	And Walker doesn't know how many outs there were.
265980	268220	He thought that was the third out.
268220	274220	Even more perplexing are some of the bloopers found in America's most popular sport, the NFL,
274220	279100	whose most infamous gaffes have approached Looney Tunes' levels of contrivance.
279100	283580	In 2012, a game between the New York Jets and the New England Patriots produced what
283580	289900	may be the most notorious folly in recent memory, the butt fumble, a play so humiliating
289980	293740	that the Jets franchise has still never quite recovered.
293740	298700	It's pretty much the blooper to end all bloopers, and has since overshadowed several other strong
298700	301420	contenders for the dumbest of all time.
301420	308780	In 1964, Minnesota Vikings defender Jim Marshall scooped up a fumble and ran 75 yards for the score.
308780	312300	The only problem was that he scored for the other team.
312300	315820	Marshall had just carried the ball in the wrong direction.
315820	321260	In 2008, Detroit Lions quarterback Dan Rolovski would show a similar lack of awareness by
321260	324460	obliviously trotting out of the back of the end zone.
324460	330300	That 08 Lions roster would end up becoming the first team to finish a season 0-16,
330300	336860	the polar opposites of the 1972 Miami Dolphins, who finished a perfect 17-0.
336860	342380	Strangely enough, this all-time great season culminated in what may very well be the ugliest
342380	344620	blooper in the history of American football.
345820	355660	With two minutes to go in the Super Bowl, kicker Gero Yapremian was sent out to ice
355660	357820	the game with a long field goal.
357820	363100	In what looked to be a moment of serendipity, the Dolphins had a chance to end their 17-0
363100	365980	season with a 17-0 victory.
365980	371500	However, Yapremian was about to show that the 72 Dolphins were not all perfect.
371900	389900	Despite the pitiful comedy of errors on that play, the Dolphins hung on to complete what
389900	395420	is thus far the only undefeated season in the Super Bowl era, and Gero's ridiculous
395420	398060	folly would be forgiven and forgotten.
398060	403660	It just goes to show, winning is all it takes to bail you out of a truly hideous situation.
404300	408380	Most of the other stories on this list wish that they could have been as fortunate.
413340	417740	On their own, bloopers, errors, and mistakes are mostly inconsequential.
418300	424300	Sports are largely governed by averages, and one bad play is typically not enough to sway
424300	426380	the outcome of a game or a season.
427020	432140	The same can't be said about this next kind of goof, the premature celebration.
435580	440780	It's easy to clown athletes for a shameful moment, but there are also times when pride
440780	442540	is just as dangerous.
442540	447740	Everyone knows the story of the tortoise and the hare, but this age-old tale always manages
447740	450220	to slip the mind of a few athletes per year.
450780	455260	Throughout the history of sports, there are numerous examples of players losing through
455260	457100	nothing else but their own hubris.
457740	463260	As shown in the fable, racing often serves as the backdrop for many improbable defeats.
463900	469660	In 2015, track and field athlete Tanjoy Pepiad was too focused on gesturing to the crowd
469660	473100	to notice his competitors stealing the victory from under his nose.
473660	477980	In 2004, a similar fate befell Superbike racer Sean Emmett.
478620	483180	Perhaps the most painful homestretch fail would happen to Olympic snowboarder Lindsay
483180	488060	Jacob Ellis, who would kiss the gold medal goodbye after a showboating stunt sent her
488060	489340	tumbling into the snow.
489900	494300	Moments like these prove the time-honored wisdom that you should never celebrate until
494300	499660	after you cross the finish line, or in the case of American football, the end zone.
500700	506140	It's a sport which has seen an alarming number of cases where a celebrating player has inexplicably
506140	511180	dropped the ball at the one-yard line, thus invalidating what should have been a guaranteed
511180	511500	score.
512140	517500	One such case that's particularly hard to watch happened in a 2014 college game between
517500	518620	Utah and Oregon.
519180	525340	After the Utah receiver let go of a surefire touchdown, Oregon returned in 99 yards the
525340	530300	other way, a 14-point swing, all from one careless mistake.
530860	535820	It's a mistake so punishing you'd think that any player would learn to never do it again.
536700	542940	Well, any player besides DeSean Jackson, who dropped the ball not once, but twice in his
542940	543420	career.
543980	547980	Perhaps the most famous case of dropping the ball came on the biggest stage.
548620	554460	In Super Bowl 27, Leon Letts hot dogging allowed an opposing player to catch up and strip the
554460	555740	ball before he scored.
556300	561180	Nine months later, with the Super Bowl blunders still fresh in everyone's mind, Leon would
561180	562700	somehow manage to top it.
563260	568460	In a Thanksgiving Day game against the Dolphins, a blocked field goal at the end of regulation
568460	570780	left the whole Cowboys sideline celebrating.
571420	576300	Unfortunately, another inexplicable botch would render that celebration premature.
593260	599900	It's safe to say that after this, both Leon and the Cowboys were reminded of the most
599900	602220	fundamental law in competition.
602220	603900	It ain't over till it's over.
605260	611020	Sports can be truly chaotic and there is very little that can be confidently excluded from
611020	613260	the possible range of outcomes.
613260	618460	As someone who spends a lot of time watching a losing team, I often find myself imagining
618460	622620	a hypothetical list of events that would have to occur for them to actually win.
623260	627340	The more they're getting beat, the more preposterous that list becomes.
627340	632220	But would that imaginary comeback be impossible or just improbable?
632220	637180	In other words, at what point does a deficit become truly insurmountable?
637180	642380	We may never know for sure how big of a lead is safe, but we do know which ones are not.
642380	653420	On April 21st, 2012, the Boston Red Sox got out to a 9-0 lead against their arch rivals,
653420	654620	the New York Yankees.
655180	660380	Just three innings later, the Yankees had scored 15 straight runs, flipping the script
660380	663260	on what surely looked like a Boston blowout.
663260	668540	It was one of the biggest swings in any baseball game ever, and it fell just short of the biggest
668540	669500	outright comeback.
670060	676380	Three times in MLB history has a team blown a 12-run lead, the most recent being the 2001
676380	682060	Seattle Mariners, who allowed the Cleveland Indians to crawl all the way back from a 14-2
682060	682620	deficit.
683180	689100	The largest blown lead in basketball history belongs to the 1996 Denver Nuggets, who were
689100	692460	unable to close out a 36-point cushion.
692460	697900	In 1957, Huddersfield Town would blow the biggest single-game lead of any football club.
698460	704300	After building a towering 5-1 margin with just 27 minutes to play, the Terriers would
704300	708620	somehow go on to blow a 4-goal lead, losing 6-7.
709260	715980	In ice hockey, numerous NHL teams have managed to blow a 5-goal lead, including Wayne Gretzky's
715980	721980	Edmonton Oilers, who couldn't hang on to a 5-0 lead in a 1982 playoff game.
721980	726860	Coincidentally, the biggest comeback in NFL history would also befall the Oilers in a
726860	733180	playoff game, who squandered an almost unthinkable 35-3 lead to the Buffalo Bills.
733180	737740	Statistically speaking, these games are all candidates for the worst-ever choke of their
737740	743740	respective sports, but considering the full context in which they occurred, few are remembered
743740	744300	as such.
744860	749660	Most of these losses just didn't end up mattering in the grand scheme of things, relegating
749660	755180	them to probabilistic anomalies, mere trivia for a number of obsessed geeks.
755180	759580	They don't really come to mind when the average sports fan thinks of the most gut-wrenching
759580	759980	chokes.
760620	765340	As the INES would say, they were disasters with only local consequences.
765900	770780	If we want to find some truly epic chokes, we're gonna need some bigger fish to fry.
776380	781580	It's fairly agreed upon in sports jargon that the term choke describes when a team or player
781580	783500	has exhausted a massive advantage.
784140	788860	In most circumstances, it refers to an advantage that has been built up over the course of
788860	789260	a game.
789820	795100	However, in a few cases, that advantage is in play long before the game even starts.
795660	800940	In every sports league, you're bound to run into mismatches, where one competitor is heavily
800940	802540	favored over the other.
802540	807820	While nobody wants to blow a huge lead, it can sometimes prove just as humiliating to
807820	810300	lose to an opponent you're expected to dominate.
811020	816780	Heading into 1990, Mike Tyson was far and away the most feared fighter on the planet.
816780	822940	Boasting an undefeated 37-0 record with 33 knockouts, the heavyweight champion was probably
822940	826460	the closest any fighter has ever been to being truly invincible.
827100	833420	Fans were anticipating him to make quick work of 42-1 long shot Buster Douglas, but to everyone's
833420	839100	shock, the mostly unknown underdog would hand Iron Mike the first loss of his career.
839100	844780	In what is widely considered to be the biggest upset in boxing history, not bad for a guy
844780	847260	who had pretty much been brought in as a jobber.
847900	853340	It turns out that a few other sports make use of jobbers, most notably college football,
853340	858940	whose top teams are notorious for scheduling a few games a year versus cupcake opponents.
858940	864300	University athletic departments have been known to pay six-figure sums for vastly inferior
864300	867260	teams to come into town and get pummeled into the turf.
867820	871340	It's a small price to pay for what should be an automatic victory.
871900	876300	That's certainly what the 2007 Michigan Wolverines were thinking when they scheduled
876300	880460	their opening day contest against the Appalachian State Mountaineers.
880460	885100	Going into the season, Michigan was ranked as the fifth best team in the nation,
885100	888300	and their opponents were quite literally out of their league.
888300	894060	The Mountaineers were a Division I Double-A team, a complete tier beneath Michigan's pedigree.
894060	897260	There would have been no shame if Appalachian State had simply
897260	899580	laid down and accepted their beating.
899580	904540	Unfortunately for Michigan, they were about to learn that there are no free wins in sports.
905580	906860	And the kick is blocked!
907740	912940	Appalachian State has stunned the college football world,
912940	916620	one of the greatest upsets in sports history.
917420	921900	College sports provide ample opportunities for the classic Cinderella story,
921980	925340	a term most frequently used during March Madness.
925340	932060	In Division I basketball, the season champion is decided by a 64-team single-elimination tournament.
932060	935820	The early rounds of the tournament are a breeding ground for memorable upsets,
935820	940300	as the top teams in the country face off against others who are just happy to be there.
940940	945180	Every few years or so, a powerhouse team would get bounced from the tournament by
945180	947260	some school you couldn't even find on a map.
947820	954940	But after 33 years of the 64-team format, a 1-seed had never been defeated by a 16-seed.
954940	962700	That was until 2018, when the 31-2 Virginia Cavaliers faced off against the UMBC Retrievers.
963340	968060	In what may very well have been the most shocking upset in the history of college sports,
968060	971900	Virginia didn't just lose, but got blown out by 20 points.
972540	974780	College sports aren't for everyone,
974780	979740	but you have to admit that they are capable of producing madness that you won't see anywhere else.
980380	983980	However, the most enduring upsets are left to the professionals.
984540	990940	The 2007 New England Patriots are considered by some to be the greatest NFL team ever assembled.
990940	996780	They set all kinds of records and were on track for a perfect season to surpass the 72 Dolphins.
997420	1002940	After cruising to the Super Bowl, they faced off against the paltry New York Giants,
1002940	1005260	a team that hadn't even won their division.
1005980	1011420	After leading for most of the game, the Patriots were just two minutes away from capping off the
1011420	1018860	greatest season in NFL history. But hey, those pesky Giants somehow, some way, could not be
1018860	1025820	stopped. And the mighty Patriots had to settle for 18-1. Every year the Super Bowl is the most
1025820	1032220	watched broadcast in America, but its viewership pales in comparison to the World Cup, which
1032220	1038300	consistently attracts an audience of billions. The largest in-person audience for any World Cup
1038300	1045100	game was estimated to be 220,000 for the 1950 final in Rio de Janeiro, an audience that would
1045100	1050780	go on to witness one of the most brutal defeats in the history of sports. That year the Brazilian
1050780	1056380	men's national team looked unstoppable. They had smoked their past two opponents by a combined
1056380	1063420	score of 13-2 and had only Uruguay standing in the way of their first World Cup. The Brazilians
1063420	1068460	were so confident in their victory that they had politicians delivering congratulatory speeches
1068460	1074380	before the game even started. Due to the unusual round-robin format of that year's tournament,
1074380	1080940	Brazil could draw the game and still win the cup. It seemed simple enough. You have all the momentum
1080940	1086860	in the world. You are far and away the better team. All you have to do is not lose in your home
1086860	1096460	stadium and you're the world champions. They lost 2-1. There's an argument to be made that out of
1096460	1103180	every defeat in the history of sports, this was the single most agonizing. After the game, the
1103180	1109820	200,000 Brazilians in attendance sat in absolute silence. They weren't just stunned, they were
1109820	1116460	traumatized. It was reported that in the following moments, multiple fans leapt from the grandstands
1116460	1123980	to their deaths. This may be hard to understand for non-sports viewers, but some people just really do
1123980	1130940	care that much about the outcome of a game. As absurd as it may be to say, choking can literally
1130940	1137100	be a matter of life and death. The biggest upset certainly live up to their name. They can be quite
1137100	1143020	upsetting to watch. However, these moments don't place as highly on the scale of sorrow when you
1143020	1148540	consider why they were called upsets in the first place. While the Davids of the sports world may
1148540	1154460	eke out the occasional fluke win, there's a reason why the Goliaths have earned their title. Apart
1154460	1161900	from the rare stumble, they tend to win. A lot. After losing to UMBC, Virginia would run it back
1161900	1167260	and win the tournament the very next season. Mike Tyson would eventually reclaim his heavyweight
1167260	1173980	title. The Patriots won three more Super Bowls and Brazil won five World Cups. It's safe to say
1173980	1179660	that most of these guys ended up just fine. When we come back, we'll take a look at chokes so
1179660	1182940	devastating that no one involved would ever really recover.
1182940	1192140	Do you realize what could have happened if I hadn't sensed the pit in time?
1192780	1195340	I suppose you could have choked.
1200460	1204220	Well everyone, it's the worst time of the year. Football season.
1204780	1209500	Boy, can't wait to watch the Jaguars suck it up for another four and a half months.
1209580	1215100	But thankfully, rooting for a future team can suck just a little bit less with today's sponsor,
1215740	1221100	Bespoke Post. A subscription service that ships out premium goods every month,
1221100	1226940	or about twice as often as every Jaguars win. Bespoke offers a variety of products ranging
1226940	1233260	from outdoor, home, cooking, and more. Just take the online quiz to find one that's right for you.
1233260	1239180	By subscribing, Bespoke will send you a box with $70 worth of stuff for just a fraction of the cost.
1239580	1245180	Which makes them a far better value than Jaguars tickets. Each month, you get a preview of what's
1245180	1250060	inside. And unlike your abysmal hometown franchise, if you don't like the product,
1250060	1254860	you can swap it out for something else or skip the month entirely for no charge.
1254860	1259900	For football fans, I recommend Bespoke's parked camping chair for your tailgating needs.
1259900	1266220	And for Jaguars fans specifically, I recommend one of Bespoke's many alcohol-related accessories.

1285420	1291260	I'm sure that just like Urban Meyer, you'll get a kick out of it. But hey, it's not all doom and
1291260	1296540	gloom in Jacksonville. In fact, the Jags may have actually figured out the NFL's greatest
1296540	1301260	new strategy. You can't choke if you're never winning in the first place.
1309340	1313260	Many children around the world have dreams of becoming a star athlete.
1313900	1318300	It's an all too common thought to envision yourself scoring the game-winning shot as the
1318300	1325260	clock expires. What many of us fail to consider, however, is the opposite case. A handful of
1325260	1330700	athletes do manage to beat the odds and make it to the biggest stage. But rather than having
1330700	1336140	their dreams come true, they all of a sudden find themselves in the midst of a living nightmare.
1340700	1346940	Chris Webber had a solid NBA career, but most people only remember him for one costly mistake
1346940	1360060	that he made in college. Down by two in the final seconds of the championship game, Webber got
1360060	1365740	caught in a bind and attempted to reset the situation by calling timeout. The only problem
1365740	1371420	was that his team was out of timeouts, resulting in a technical foul that immediately ended their
1371420	1376780	chances of victory. It seemed that no matter how much Chris Webber accomplished in the rest of his
1376780	1383340	basketball career, he could never overcome the stigma of this one miscue. A similar fate would
1383340	1390140	befall NFL tight end Jackie Smith. In the 1970s, he was one of the best players at his position.
1390140	1395100	During the 78 season, he was called out of retirement to play for a Dallas Cowboys team
1395100	1401420	with championship aspirations. That team did end up making it to the Super Bowl, and down by a
1401420	1407900	score late, quarterback Roger Staubach targeted a wide open Smith in the end zone, who proceeded to
1407900	1419100	drop the game-tying touchdown. Dallas was forced to settle for a field goal, and that four-point
1419100	1424220	swing wound up being the difference in the game. Smith's pivotal blunder caused him to be
1424220	1430140	single-handedly blamed for the defeat. Today, this lone moment is pretty much all he's known for.
1430940	1436140	Across his Hall of Fame career, Jackie Smith caught 480 passes,
1436140	1439900	but he is forever doomed to be remembered for the one he dropped.
1443100	1450780	It can seem rather unjust how much one mistake can ruin someone's legacy. In the 1994 World Cup,
1450780	1456620	Roberto Baggio was the breakout star of the whole tournament, helping to carry the Italians to the
1456620	1462140	Finals. But after the game went to penalties when the team needed him most, he sailed his
1462140	1468860	lone opportunity over the crossbar. The miss would haunt Baggio for years, who is remembered today as
1468860	1474940	one of the best players to never win the World Cup. In association football, the striker is often the
1474940	1480540	most revered position on the field. The same can't be said for their American counterparts.
1481180	1486060	In the NFL, the kicker is one of the most thankless roles that anyone can fill.
1486140	1491660	We're talking about our idiot kicker. Do your job well and no one bats an eye,
1491660	1496060	but screw up just once and you will be ridiculed until the cows come home.
1496940	1502940	In recent history, two of the cruelest misses that come to mind are Blair Walsh's chip-shot shank and
1502940	1508460	Cody Parkey's double doink. However, the distinction for the costliest miss in NFL
1508460	1514780	history has to go to one of two incidents from the 90s. Across more than a half century,
1514780	1520140	four Super Bowls have been decided by a last-second field goal. Three were made,
1520140	1525740	and one was missed. The dishonor belonged to Buffalo Bills kicker Scott Norwood,
1525740	1530060	who missed wide right on a 47-yarder that would have won the Bills the title.
1530700	1535740	It's a moment that has tragically become the most replayed missed field goal of all time.
1536460	1541660	However, in defense of Norwood, the standard for kickers back then was much less efficient
1541660	1547980	than what we see today. 47 yards was about at the limit of his range, so the attempt was certainly
1547980	1554940	no gimme, especially considering the circumstances. For my money, the NFL's actual worst miss occurred
1554940	1562060	eight years later in the 1998 NFC Championship game. Minnesota Vikings kicker Gary Anderson
1562060	1568140	had not missed a kick all season, leading by a touchdown with two minutes left. All Anderson
1568140	1573820	had to do was make one more to put the game out of reach. However, when staring down the most
1573820	1580700	crucial kick of his life, Anderson could not deliver. And all of a sudden, his perfect season
1580700	1587020	had turned into the perfect storm. It was just a matter of time before the Vikings' lead was gone,
1587020	1593420	along with their championship hopes. It can often be difficult for sports fans to reconcile the
1593420	1599500	complex list of reasons for why their team lost. It's usually far easier to pin the whole mess
1599500	1605740	on one player and one moment, no matter how unreasonable it may be. This type of coping
1605740	1611100	mechanism is otherwise known as scapegoating, and in the history of sports, there was perhaps
1611100	1615340	no bigger scapegoat than Bill Buckner. The nightmares are that you're gonna
1616060	1619980	let the winning run score on a ground ball through your legs.
1623500	1630300	Late in Game 6 of the 1986 World Series, Boston Red Sox manager John McNamara made the faithful
1630300	1636380	decision to leave Buckner in the game at first base. By this point, the 18-year veteran was
1636380	1641900	well past his prime and would usually be subbed out for a more sure-handed defender in crucial
1641900	1647740	situations. However, as the elder statesman of the team, Buckner was given the honors to
1647740	1653500	close out what was anticipated to be a very special moment, leading the New York Mets 5-3
1653500	1658060	in the bottom of the 10th. The Red Sox were just three outs away from winning their first
1658060	1664380	championship in nearly 70 years. After retiring the first two batters, relief pitcher Calvin
1664380	1670460	Schiraldi got into a jam, and the Mets would tie the game off a wild pitch with the bases loaded.
1671100	1676460	The next batter, Mookie Wilson, appeared to end the inning by hitting a ground ball directly at
1676460	1683420	Bill Buckner. It's the most routine defensive play in all of baseball, one so elementary that most
1683420	1689420	children have no problem making it. Bill Buckner had probably done so a thousand times by that
1689420	1696220	point in his career, but on this day, his glove is a bit loose, his ankles are a tad weak, and he's
1696220	1714540	not quite the player he used to be. The Red Sox would go on to lose game seven, and the fury of
1714540	1720220	a tortured fan base would be placed squarely on Bill Buckner's shoulders. The error had made him
1720220	1726700	a national laughingstock and an absolute outcast in the city of Boston. Buckner had to endure so
1726700	1732620	much hatred that he eventually had to move his family out to Idaho, where no one knew who he was.
1733420	1738940	And with that, we've reached a point where chokes stop being so entertaining and stark being pretty
1738940	1745100	hard to watch. To go back and revisit this footage over and over again, we are prying into what is
1745180	1750940	quite literally the worst day of someone's life. A moment in which their destiny was profoundly
1750940	1757020	and permanently altered for the worse. But what if that moment were dragged out just a little bit
1757020	1769100	longer? For as bad as some of these disasters are, at the very least they come and go in an instant.
1769100	1772940	The victims aren't given any time to marinate in their active suffering.
1773580	1779660	Even more terrifying than a single nightmare moment is the meltdown, where an athlete's anguish
1779660	1786380	is sustained over a much longer time frame. This is no longer your average everyday choking.
1786380	1793100	This is advanced choking. Golf could be described as one of the loneliest sports of all.
1793740	1799660	If you screw up, you have no one to blame but yourself. This psychological spell has set the
1799660	1806140	stage for some of the most epic implosions that any competitors ever experienced. In the 1999
1806140	1811580	British Open, Jean van de Velde is playing the tournament of his life. He entered the weekend
1811580	1817420	ranked outside the top 100 players on tour and is now on the cusp of winning one of the sports
1817420	1825100	crown jewel events. All he has to do is complete the final hole in six strokes. The following 14
1825100	1828140	minutes can only be described as a real-life horror movie.
1856060	1860060	I've never seen anything like it before, and to attempt to hit the ball out of there is pure
1860060	1866700	madness. He's thinking about it, but this is horrendous stuff Alex. No, thank goodness.
1873900	1876140	I just don't understand what on earth he was doing.
1876460	1881180	Oh
1892460	1898540	Van de Velde would eventually finish the 18th hole with a triple bogey seven and would go on to lose
1898540	1904620	in a playoff. For the rest of his career, he would never even sniff another major tournament win.
1905420	1910780	Golf may be considered the sport of gentleman, but there are times when it can be absolutely
1910780	1917020	savage. Three years before Jean van de Velde's meltdown, Greg Norman succumbed to one that was
1917020	1924620	even worse. If you thought one hole of misery was bad, you should see it prolonged over an entire
1924620	1930700	round. Norman entered the final day of the 1996 Masters with a commanding six-stroke lead.
1931260	1936620	Over the course of that Sunday afternoon, that lead would slowly and steadily evaporate into
1936620	1941500	nothingness. It was like watching a wayward sailor drift at sea in a sinking ship.
1942220	1948540	There was no saving him. In about three hours, Norman's six-stroke lead had disintegrated into
1948540	1955900	a five-stroke deficit. By the end of it all, he wasn't even close to winning. One bad play can be
1955900	1961900	written off as an outlier. Several in a row can be chalked up to some bad luck, but to suddenly
1961900	1967820	lose your god-given abilities for an entire game, you just might have to start believing in curses.
1968780	1975580	One fan base very familiar with curses is that of the Chicago Cubs, who by 2003 had experienced
1975580	1981740	nearly a century of futility. In that season's NLCS, they finally looked on track to reverse
1981740	1987660	their fortunes. After shutting out the Florida Marlins for the first seven innings of game six,
1987660	1992780	the Cubs were just five outs away from a long-awaited return to the World Series.
1992780	1999420	But after Cubs fan Steve Bartman crossed paths with a chance foul ball, it was as if fate itself
1999420	2005100	had flipped a switch. The Cubs, who had controlled the entire game to that point, had just been
2005100	2007100	transported to the inning from hell.
2036060	2043420	Three runs are going to score on a double by Mordecai, and this crowd at Wrigley Field stunned
2043420	2050860	in disbelief. Baseball is one of the only sports with no time limit, meaning that the potential for
2050860	2057900	suffering is theoretically infinite. After watching their victory disappear before their eyes, Cubs
2057900	2063420	fans must have been wondering if the tournament would ever end. It turned out that the old curse
2063420	2069660	was there to stay for just a bit longer. At the turn of the 21st century, the only other baseball
2069660	2075340	team as misfortunate as the Cubs were our old friends, the Red Sox. Not only did they have a
2075340	2080620	generational championship drought of their own, they had to sit and watch as their bitter rivals
2080620	2086220	became the most successful franchise in all of sports. Throughout the 20th century, the Red Sox
2086220	2092700	had almost too many heartbreaks to count, with one of the absolute worst taking place in the 1978
2092700	2099260	season. On the morning of July 20th, the Red Sox led the American League standings by a staggering
2099260	2106460	14-game margin over the Yankees. By September, Boston's lead had dwindled to just four games,
2106460	2111980	just as they were slated to face the Yankees in a four-game series. The Red Sox ended up getting
2111980	2118460	swept so badly that the performance went on to be known as the Boston Massacre. Just like that, the
2118460	2124940	14-game lead had vanished, and the Yankees had tied them in the standings. After squandering the
2124940	2130540	entire advantage they once had, the Red Sox were given one last opportunity to right the ship,
2131100	2136540	a regular season tiebreaker in their home stadium, with the winner advancing to the postseason.
2137180	2143260	However, any chance of redemption would soon be foiled when Bucky Dent, a player who'd only hit
2143260	2148540	four home runs that entire season, blasted a three-run shot that ended up winning the game
2148540	2155340	for the Yankees. Boston was once again left in the dust and would have to watch their nemesis win yet
2155340	2162700	another championship. Late season collapses are probably the most long-form meltdowns in all of
2162700	2169100	sports, but in a season as long as baseball's, they're not unprecedented. If you want to know the
2169100	2174540	absolute nastiest chokes that sports have to offer, you will find them in an exclusive
2174540	2185980	collection of moments that were truly one of a kind. When it comes to ripping your heart out,
2185980	2192860	these are the cream of the crop. At long last, we have arrived at the Chernobyl of sports disasters.
2192860	2199660	A handful of events that, no matter how many times you watch, still seem inconceivable. We've
2199660	2205740	talked about missed field goals before, but there's one particular miss that I've neglected to discuss
2205740	2213740	until now. In the NFL, desperation plays are rarely ever successful, but in a 2003 game between the
2213740	2219980	Saints and Jaguars, New Orleans scored one of the only multilateral touchdowns of the 21st century.
2220700	2226060	Now, the uninitiated out there may think that we have finally uncovered the elusive Jacksonville
2226060	2236460	Jaguars choke, but rest assured, the real choke was yet to come. He missed the extra point wide
2236460	2243100	right. After one of the most sensational plays in recent memory, Saints kicker John Carney missed
2243100	2250540	the extra point, a kick which at the time had almost a 99% success rate. The River City Relay
2250540	2256140	would ultimately be in vain, and like most things in Jacksonville, would be pretty much forgotten.
2256780	2261660	Believe it or not though, there are still more painful ways to lose a football game.
2261660	2268140	To find out how, we have to once again visit our favorite college chokers, the Michigan Wolverines,
2268140	2272540	whose football program never really recovered from the loss to Appalachian State.
2273180	2279260	In 2015, Michigan looked to turn things around by hiring former NFL head coach Jim Harbaugh.
2279820	2286060	Suffice to say, his tenure thus far hasn't quite lived up to expectations. We could have seen it
2286060	2292380	coming had we paid attention to a particular omen from his first season in charge. With just 10
2292380	2298140	seconds left, the Wolverines have a two-point lead against rival Michigan State. All they have
2298140	2315340	to do to win is run one successful punt. And well, I think this guy's expression says it all.
2316300	2322140	But for as frustrating as this was to watch, there is still one loss in the history of American
2322140	2330620	football that is even more inexcusable. On November 19, 1978, the New York Giants
2330620	2337580	are leading the Philadelphia Eagles 17-12 with just 30 seconds to play. The Giants have the ball,
2337580	2343900	and the Eagles have no timeouts. Theoretically, losing from this position should be impossible.
2343900	2350140	But for some godforsaken reason, the Giants are going to find a way to do so. Funnily enough,
2350140	2355500	their demise would come almost entirely from the NFL's weird problem with kneeling,
2355500	2361340	and not the kind you're probably thinking of. In the modern-day game, it is customary for teams
2361340	2366940	to close out their final possession in victory formation, where the quarterback simply touches
2366940	2372620	his knee to the ground and runs out the rest of the clock. But back in the day, many people in
2372620	2379100	the league took issue to intentionally downing the ball, going so far as to call it unsportsmanlike.
2379100	2383980	Because of this, the foolproof strategy was sometimes disregarded in favor of a more
2383980	2390140	conventional play. All quarterback Joe Pisserchik had to do was drop to the ground and the Giants
2390140	2396380	were home free. However, offensive coordinator Bob Gibson insisted on running a handoff.
2396940	2402940	When the play call came in, the Giants players were in disbelief, with running back Larry Zonka
2402940	2408540	outright refusing to take the ball. But after Gibson threatened to cut Pisserchik if he
2408540	2415420	disobeyed the order, the play went on as planned. And well, there's a reason why every team today
2415420	2427260	just takes a knee. The Eagles scored the game-winning touchdown from a fumble that
2427260	2433020	shouldn't even have been a possibility. Giants fans were so irate that many ended up throwing
2433020	2439580	the next game's tickets into a bonfire. Bob Gibson was axed the next morning and was never hired to
2439580	2445180	coach at any level of football ever again. Perhaps the most fitting thing of all was the player who
2445180	2450700	scored that touchdown. Most of you watching may not recognize him, but if you've been following
2450700	2457260	along, this is someone we've already met long ago. And his wisdom rang just as true all the way
2457260	2465340	back then. Players and coaches that get labeled as chokers don't tend to stick around for very long,
2465340	2471020	but ever so often you'll find one that does. An exceptional talent who can just never have things
2471020	2476780	work out for them in the end. This type of competitor is otherwise known as a choke artist,
2476780	2484060	the most notable of which has to be NBA point guard Chris Paul. In 14 playoff appearances,
2484060	2491980	Paul has managed to blow a 3-2 lead, a 3-1 lead, and a jaw-dropping 5-2-0 leads. No matter which
2491980	2498220	team he plays for, postseason success is always just out of reach. One of those teams was the
2498220	2503900	2018 Houston Rockets, who finished the regular season at the top of the Western Conference
2503900	2509900	standings ahead of the formidable Golden State Warriors. The Warriors had taken the league by
2509900	2515340	storm after becoming extremely efficient at shooting three-pointers. Rockets general manager
2515340	2520060	Daryl Morey could see the tide turning and constructed a roster designed to beat the
2520060	2525900	Warriors at their own game. The two teams were on a collision course that would ultimately be decided
2525900	2531820	in game seven of the conference finals. Leading by 12 in the second quarter, the Rockets would
2531820	2538060	enter the most unholy stretch of basketball that any team has ever witnessed. In the next 23
2538060	2545180	minutes of game time, the Rockets missed 27 threes in a row. That year, the Rockets were having the
2545180	2550700	most productive three-point shooting season in history. They had made over 36 percent of their
2550700	2558940	attempts. The odds of this team missing 27 in a row was about 1 in 186,000. And for it to happen
2558940	2565500	at the absolute worst possible time, that's a level of cruelty I cannot even begin to describe.
2566220	2571900	It's one thing to cost yourself the game off some incompetent mistake, but at least in that
2571900	2577820	case you get to blame it on something. What's truly demoralizing is being defeated by nothing
2577820	2584940	more than the cold indifference of chance. If you think that 1 in 186,000 are rough odds,
2584940	2589500	they don't even come close to the level of misfortune that Toronto Blue Jays pitcher Dave
2589500	2596060	Steeve experienced in September of 1988. One of the greatest achievements for any pitcher is the
2596060	2603740	no-hitter. In the 150-year history of the majors, only 317 have ever been thrown. At the end of the
2603740	2610140	88 season, Dave Steeve had two consecutive no-hitters blown up on the last possible out.
2610700	2616940	Sports writer John Boyce estimated that the chance of this happening was 1 in 241 million,
2617580	2623020	but that still may not be as unlikely as what happened in the world of motorsports on May 29,
2623020	2629980	2011. Many consider the last Sunday in May to be the greatest day in racing. In the United States,
2629980	2637260	it features two long-standing traditions, starting at noon with the Indy 500, whose 2011 running saw
2637260	2644060	rookie J.R. Hildebrand one lap away from victory. In the final corner, he misjudged a pass on a
2644060	2650380	lapped car and crashed, allowing second-place Dan Weldon to steal the win on the final straightaway.
2650380	2656380	The sponsor of Hildebrand's car was the National Guard, who just so happened to be sponsoring Dale
2656380	2662540	Earnhardt Jr.'s car in the Coke 600 that evening. As Earnhardt found himself leading on the final
2662540	2678460	lap, the National Guard car would experience deja vu. In an astounding coincidence, two separate
2678460	2683740	drivers with the same sponsor would lose their respective races in the final turn of the final
2683740	2693740	lap. A remarkable case of synchronized choking. Can choking really manifest itself on a macroscopic
2693740	2699740	level? If so, the best evidence of it happening would have to be the wildest time in the history
2699740	2707820	of American sports, 2016, otherwise known as the year of the choke. It started in the NBA Western
2707820	2714700	Conference Finals, where the Oklahoma City Thunder blew a 3-1 series lead to the Golden State Warriors.
2714700	2719900	After advancing to the finals, the Warriors proceeded to blow a 3-1 lead against the Cleveland
2719900	2726140	Cavaliers. Five months later in the World Series, the Cleveland Indians blew a 3-1 lead to the
2726140	2733500	Chicago Cubs, who finally ended their century-long championship drought. Two championship collapses in
2733500	2740140	the same sports season was almost unprecedented, but the worst was still yet to come. Three months
2740140	2746380	after the World Series, the Atlanta Falcons orchestrated the worst choke in Super Bowl history,
2746380	2753180	blowing a 28-3 lead to the New England Patriots. In a span of just eight months, all three major
2753180	2759420	American sports saw their champions crown through the ashes of historic chokes, a feat that will
2759420	2765660	probably never happen again. Of course, I would be remiss if I didn't mention a certain other
2765660	2771180	choke that happened in the United States at around the same time, in what has very much become our
2771180	2777980	country's new most popular sport. But out of the prior three, the Falcons choke has to be the most
2777980	2784700	iconic. However, I personally consider the Warriors choke to be the most historically fascinating.
2784700	2790780	That season, the Warriors broke a record that few thought was possible. Their 73 regular season
2790780	2796460	wins were the most in NBA history, and we would probably look back on them as the greatest team
2796460	2802300	ever if they hadn't choked in the finals. Their defeat completed one of the strangest statistical
2802300	2809180	oddities in all of sports. Combined with the 96 Red Wings, the 01 Mariners, and the 07 Patriots,
2809180	2814460	the best regular season team from each of the big four U.S. sports leagues has failed to win
2814460	2821180	the championship. The Warriors have had no shortage of winning since, but that missing ring still looms
2821180	2828860	as a big blemish on an otherwise dominant dynasty. In sports, blowing a 3-1 lead is pretty uncommon.
2828860	2835500	Blowing an 8-1 lead sounds almost unfathomable. The competitive yacht racing championship features
2835500	2843500	a best-of-17 series. And in the 2013 running, Team New Zealand led Team USA eight races to one.
2844220	2849580	Needing only a single victory in the next eight to clinch the title, New Zealand would go on to
2849580	2855820	lose each and every one. In terms of sheer magnitude, no other choke in sports even comes
2855820	2861980	close. But if you're asking me about the absolute greatest choke of all time, there is one other
2861980	2868780	that tops it. While an 8-1 choke is truly mind-blowing, I still prefer the simple elegance of
2868780	2875980	the 3-0 choke, the fabled reverse sweep. Everyone knows baseball as one of those sports that's so old.
2875980	2882620	Pretty much any feat you can imagine has already been done long ago. But as of the 2004 season,
2882620	2889980	no team had ever come back from a three games to none series deficit. 2004 marked year 86 of
2889980	2895900	misery for the Boston Red Sox, who looked to once again have their hopes and dreams shattered by the
2895900	2901420	New York Yankees. There had been Red Sox fans who lived and died without ever once seeing their
2901420	2908140	beloved team win it all. All they had ever known was non-stop heartbreak, countless opportunities
2908140	2914860	utterly wasted. By this point, the outcome seemed like a foregone conclusion. The Red Sox are getting
2914860	2920940	crushed again. Their last sliver of hope relies on doing something that had never been done before
2920940	2928060	in the history of their sport. It all comes down to this, the Boston Red Sox versus the rest of time.
2935100	2940940	You know thus far I've only really shown chokes in a negative light. I've described them as brutal,
2940940	2946700	cruel, and agonizing. But very rarely you'll encounter those ethereal moments when a choke is
2946700	2951900	actually quite beautiful, where all the broken pieces just managed to fit together in the most
2951900	2958860	perfect way. It's like poetry in motion, a surreal window into someplace else where great things
2958860	2966140	really can happen. The truth is that outside of the sports world, most of us are losers. It can seem
2966140	2973020	like whatever success we do find always manages to slip away. In a society that seems to value
2973020	2979900	winning above all else, it's a tough pill to swallow. Losing is as undesirable as it is universal.
2980620	2986540	It's hard to find a feeling more relatable. No matter how good you are, everyone has to
2986540	2991980	lose eventually. In sports, it's easy to get caught up in the ruthless pursuit of glory.
2992620	2998780	At times it can feel downright nihilistic. Perhaps the reason we find chokes so compelling is that
2998780	3004140	they're the closest winners and losers ever get to each other. They remind us that not even the
3004140	3010220	greatest winners can outrun the inevitability of defeat. It's the reason we watch and the reason
3010220	3016780	we play. If the woeful Red Sox could come back against the mighty Yankees, who knows what else
3016780	3021500	is possible.
3021500	3048220	The Yankees, who are the storied franchise as we all know, are now at a dark hour because they just
3048220	3056060	took the worst defeat not only in my lifetime as a Yankee fan, I think without question the worst
3056060	3063820	defeat in their history. Now whenever you see a team go down 3-0 in any sport, they will put up
3063820	3071420	a graphic on television which will say 2004 Red Sox down 3-0 beat New York Yankees. This is now
3071420	3076540	part of sports history and every guy who's got a team down when it's back to the walls is going
3076540	3082620	to talk about the Red Sox for the next 30 years.
