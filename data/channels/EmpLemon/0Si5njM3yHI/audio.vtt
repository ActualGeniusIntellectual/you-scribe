00:00.000 --> 00:22.180
I get asked all the time why I watch sports, and to tell you the truth, the thrill of competition

00:22.180 --> 00:35.140
comes down to two very simple things, the euphoria of victory and the agony of defeat.

00:35.140 --> 00:42.400
A wise man once said, you play to win the game, a quotation so blunt that many may find

00:42.400 --> 00:48.060
it humorous, but if you look past the literal denotation of the statement, it serves more

00:48.060 --> 00:52.980
to punctuate the harsh reality of what it truly means to compete.

00:52.980 --> 00:56.700
When you get right down to it, sports are brutal.

00:56.700 --> 01:01.820
After you strip away all the fame and fortune of being a professional athlete, history only

01:01.820 --> 01:07.700
cares about two things, how much you won and how much you lost.

01:07.700 --> 01:12.660
As sports fans, we often like to craft little narratives around players and teams, feel

01:12.660 --> 01:16.660
good stories to make them seem a bit more like a protagonist.

01:16.660 --> 01:22.420
In this day and age, everyone's looking for a hero, and unfortunately, this is the point

01:22.420 --> 01:25.420
where sports deviates from fiction.

01:25.420 --> 01:29.600
Because at the end of the day, when all the chips are down, it doesn't matter how much

01:29.600 --> 01:35.620
you tried, how far you came or how well you treated everyone else, all will be forgotten

01:35.620 --> 01:37.800
if you fail to win.

01:37.800 --> 01:43.060
And unfortunately for our heroes, there's just not a lot of winning to go around.

01:43.060 --> 01:49.100
The vast majority of competitors are doomed to retire as nothing more than forgotten losers.

01:49.100 --> 01:52.520
But not every loser is necessarily forgettable.

01:52.520 --> 01:58.540
As it turns out, there are many ways to lose in sports, some more spectacular than others.

01:58.540 --> 02:03.580
You can throw a game on purpose, get cheated out of a win by the refs, or get blown out

02:03.580 --> 02:08.100
so badly that it makes everyone question what game you were even playing.

02:08.140 --> 02:13.900
However, if you truly want to be remembered in defeat, look no further than the most painful

02:13.900 --> 02:17.180
way to lose in all of sports, the choke.

02:38.100 --> 02:52.840
In 1990, the International Atomic Energy Agency introduced a tiered scale for the purpose

02:52.840 --> 02:56.480
of categorizing the severity of nuclear meltdowns.

02:56.480 --> 03:01.440
For the purpose of this video, I believe that a similar scale is apropos for chronicling

03:01.440 --> 03:04.460
the worst meltdowns in sports.

03:04.460 --> 03:08.520
Watching these moments unfold is truly a surreal experience.

03:08.520 --> 03:13.180
There's something about it that's so morbid yet compelling, like witnessing a train wreck

03:13.180 --> 03:14.780
in slow motion.

03:14.780 --> 03:20.220
To have victory within your grasp just to let it slip away, it evokes strange feelings

03:20.220 --> 03:22.240
of existential dread.

03:22.240 --> 03:25.900
But alas, not all chokes are created equal.

03:25.900 --> 03:28.920
Some are much more dreadful than others.

03:28.920 --> 03:31.180
Let's start off with the least dreadful.

03:35.020 --> 03:39.260
The fundamental building block of every choke is the common blooper.

03:39.260 --> 03:43.900
Professional athletes are among the best of the best in strength, speed, and skill, but

03:43.900 --> 03:47.300
they're still susceptible to the occasional malfunction.

03:47.300 --> 03:52.700
If you play for long enough, you will eventually be served your fair share of humble pie.

03:52.700 --> 03:57.660
While the average blooper is often forgotten, a few manage to stand the test of time for

03:57.660 --> 03:59.660
their sheer absurdity.

03:59.660 --> 04:05.060
Jose Canseco was a baseball player who wasn't exactly known for using his head.

04:05.060 --> 04:10.140
That was until a 1993 game, when a lucky bounce off the cranium helped to score what may have

04:10.140 --> 04:13.820
been the only dome run in the history of the majors.

04:13.820 --> 04:18.500
It's unclear whether this moment was more embarrassing than what happened to Larry Walker,

04:18.500 --> 04:22.300
who forgot how to count to three in the middle of a 1994 game.

04:22.300 --> 04:25.980
And Walker doesn't know how many outs there were.

04:25.980 --> 04:28.220
He thought that was the third out.

04:28.220 --> 04:34.220
Even more perplexing are some of the bloopers found in America's most popular sport, the NFL,

04:34.220 --> 04:39.100
whose most infamous gaffes have approached Looney Tunes' levels of contrivance.

04:39.100 --> 04:43.580
In 2012, a game between the New York Jets and the New England Patriots produced what

04:43.580 --> 04:49.900
may be the most notorious folly in recent memory, the butt fumble, a play so humiliating

04:49.980 --> 04:53.740
that the Jets franchise has still never quite recovered.

04:53.740 --> 04:58.700
It's pretty much the blooper to end all bloopers, and has since overshadowed several other strong

04:58.700 --> 05:01.420
contenders for the dumbest of all time.

05:01.420 --> 05:08.780
In 1964, Minnesota Vikings defender Jim Marshall scooped up a fumble and ran 75 yards for the score.

05:08.780 --> 05:12.300
The only problem was that he scored for the other team.

05:12.300 --> 05:15.820
Marshall had just carried the ball in the wrong direction.

05:15.820 --> 05:21.260
In 2008, Detroit Lions quarterback Dan Rolovski would show a similar lack of awareness by

05:21.260 --> 05:24.460
obliviously trotting out of the back of the end zone.

05:24.460 --> 05:30.300
That 08 Lions roster would end up becoming the first team to finish a season 0-16,

05:30.300 --> 05:36.860
the polar opposites of the 1972 Miami Dolphins, who finished a perfect 17-0.

05:36.860 --> 05:42.380
Strangely enough, this all-time great season culminated in what may very well be the ugliest

05:42.380 --> 05:44.620
blooper in the history of American football.

05:45.820 --> 05:55.660
With two minutes to go in the Super Bowl, kicker Gero Yapremian was sent out to ice

05:55.660 --> 05:57.820
the game with a long field goal.

05:57.820 --> 06:03.100
In what looked to be a moment of serendipity, the Dolphins had a chance to end their 17-0

06:03.100 --> 06:05.980
season with a 17-0 victory.

06:05.980 --> 06:11.500
However, Yapremian was about to show that the 72 Dolphins were not all perfect.

06:11.900 --> 06:29.900
Despite the pitiful comedy of errors on that play, the Dolphins hung on to complete what

06:29.900 --> 06:35.420
is thus far the only undefeated season in the Super Bowl era, and Gero's ridiculous

06:35.420 --> 06:38.060
folly would be forgiven and forgotten.

06:38.060 --> 06:43.660
It just goes to show, winning is all it takes to bail you out of a truly hideous situation.

06:44.300 --> 06:48.380
Most of the other stories on this list wish that they could have been as fortunate.

06:53.340 --> 06:57.740
On their own, bloopers, errors, and mistakes are mostly inconsequential.

06:58.300 --> 07:04.300
Sports are largely governed by averages, and one bad play is typically not enough to sway

07:04.300 --> 07:06.380
the outcome of a game or a season.

07:07.020 --> 07:12.140
The same can't be said about this next kind of goof, the premature celebration.

07:15.580 --> 07:20.780
It's easy to clown athletes for a shameful moment, but there are also times when pride

07:20.780 --> 07:22.540
is just as dangerous.

07:22.540 --> 07:27.740
Everyone knows the story of the tortoise and the hare, but this age-old tale always manages

07:27.740 --> 07:30.220
to slip the mind of a few athletes per year.

07:30.780 --> 07:35.260
Throughout the history of sports, there are numerous examples of players losing through

07:35.260 --> 07:37.100
nothing else but their own hubris.

07:37.740 --> 07:43.260
As shown in the fable, racing often serves as the backdrop for many improbable defeats.

07:43.900 --> 07:49.660
In 2015, track and field athlete Tanjoy Pepiad was too focused on gesturing to the crowd

07:49.660 --> 07:53.100
to notice his competitors stealing the victory from under his nose.

07:53.660 --> 07:57.980
In 2004, a similar fate befell Superbike racer Sean Emmett.

07:58.620 --> 08:03.180
Perhaps the most painful homestretch fail would happen to Olympic snowboarder Lindsay

08:03.180 --> 08:08.060
Jacob Ellis, who would kiss the gold medal goodbye after a showboating stunt sent her

08:08.060 --> 08:09.340
tumbling into the snow.

08:09.900 --> 08:14.300
Moments like these prove the time-honored wisdom that you should never celebrate until

08:14.300 --> 08:19.660
after you cross the finish line, or in the case of American football, the end zone.

08:20.700 --> 08:26.140
It's a sport which has seen an alarming number of cases where a celebrating player has inexplicably

08:26.140 --> 08:31.180
dropped the ball at the one-yard line, thus invalidating what should have been a guaranteed

08:31.180 --> 08:31.500
score.

08:32.140 --> 08:37.500
One such case that's particularly hard to watch happened in a 2014 college game between

08:37.500 --> 08:38.620
Utah and Oregon.

08:39.180 --> 08:45.340
After the Utah receiver let go of a surefire touchdown, Oregon returned in 99 yards the

08:45.340 --> 08:50.300
other way, a 14-point swing, all from one careless mistake.

08:50.860 --> 08:55.820
It's a mistake so punishing you'd think that any player would learn to never do it again.

08:56.700 --> 09:02.940
Well, any player besides DeSean Jackson, who dropped the ball not once, but twice in his

09:02.940 --> 09:03.420
career.

09:03.980 --> 09:07.980
Perhaps the most famous case of dropping the ball came on the biggest stage.

09:08.620 --> 09:14.460
In Super Bowl 27, Leon Letts hot dogging allowed an opposing player to catch up and strip the

09:14.460 --> 09:15.740
ball before he scored.

09:16.300 --> 09:21.180
Nine months later, with the Super Bowl blunders still fresh in everyone's mind, Leon would

09:21.180 --> 09:22.700
somehow manage to top it.

09:23.260 --> 09:28.460
In a Thanksgiving Day game against the Dolphins, a blocked field goal at the end of regulation

09:28.460 --> 09:30.780
left the whole Cowboys sideline celebrating.

09:31.420 --> 09:36.300
Unfortunately, another inexplicable botch would render that celebration premature.

09:53.260 --> 09:59.900
It's safe to say that after this, both Leon and the Cowboys were reminded of the most

09:59.900 --> 10:02.220
fundamental law in competition.

10:02.220 --> 10:03.900
It ain't over till it's over.

10:05.260 --> 10:11.020
Sports can be truly chaotic and there is very little that can be confidently excluded from

10:11.020 --> 10:13.260
the possible range of outcomes.

10:13.260 --> 10:18.460
As someone who spends a lot of time watching a losing team, I often find myself imagining

10:18.460 --> 10:22.620
a hypothetical list of events that would have to occur for them to actually win.

10:23.260 --> 10:27.340
The more they're getting beat, the more preposterous that list becomes.

10:27.340 --> 10:32.220
But would that imaginary comeback be impossible or just improbable?

10:32.220 --> 10:37.180
In other words, at what point does a deficit become truly insurmountable?

10:37.180 --> 10:42.380
We may never know for sure how big of a lead is safe, but we do know which ones are not.

10:42.380 --> 10:53.420
On April 21st, 2012, the Boston Red Sox got out to a 9-0 lead against their arch rivals,

10:53.420 --> 10:54.620
the New York Yankees.

10:55.180 --> 11:00.380
Just three innings later, the Yankees had scored 15 straight runs, flipping the script

11:00.380 --> 11:03.260
on what surely looked like a Boston blowout.

11:03.260 --> 11:08.540
It was one of the biggest swings in any baseball game ever, and it fell just short of the biggest

11:08.540 --> 11:09.500
outright comeback.

11:10.060 --> 11:16.380
Three times in MLB history has a team blown a 12-run lead, the most recent being the 2001

11:16.380 --> 11:22.060
Seattle Mariners, who allowed the Cleveland Indians to crawl all the way back from a 14-2

11:22.060 --> 11:22.620
deficit.

11:23.180 --> 11:29.100
The largest blown lead in basketball history belongs to the 1996 Denver Nuggets, who were

11:29.100 --> 11:32.460
unable to close out a 36-point cushion.

11:32.460 --> 11:37.900
In 1957, Huddersfield Town would blow the biggest single-game lead of any football club.

11:38.460 --> 11:44.300
After building a towering 5-1 margin with just 27 minutes to play, the Terriers would

11:44.300 --> 11:48.620
somehow go on to blow a 4-goal lead, losing 6-7.

11:49.260 --> 11:55.980
In ice hockey, numerous NHL teams have managed to blow a 5-goal lead, including Wayne Gretzky's

11:55.980 --> 12:01.980
Edmonton Oilers, who couldn't hang on to a 5-0 lead in a 1982 playoff game.

12:01.980 --> 12:06.860
Coincidentally, the biggest comeback in NFL history would also befall the Oilers in a

12:06.860 --> 12:13.180
playoff game, who squandered an almost unthinkable 35-3 lead to the Buffalo Bills.

12:13.180 --> 12:17.740
Statistically speaking, these games are all candidates for the worst-ever choke of their

12:17.740 --> 12:23.740
respective sports, but considering the full context in which they occurred, few are remembered

12:23.740 --> 12:24.300
as such.

12:24.860 --> 12:29.660
Most of these losses just didn't end up mattering in the grand scheme of things, relegating

12:29.660 --> 12:35.180
them to probabilistic anomalies, mere trivia for a number of obsessed geeks.

12:35.180 --> 12:39.580
They don't really come to mind when the average sports fan thinks of the most gut-wrenching

12:39.580 --> 12:39.980
chokes.

12:40.620 --> 12:45.340
As the INES would say, they were disasters with only local consequences.

12:45.900 --> 12:50.780
If we want to find some truly epic chokes, we're gonna need some bigger fish to fry.

12:56.380 --> 13:01.580
It's fairly agreed upon in sports jargon that the term choke describes when a team or player

13:01.580 --> 13:03.500
has exhausted a massive advantage.

13:04.140 --> 13:08.860
In most circumstances, it refers to an advantage that has been built up over the course of

13:08.860 --> 13:09.260
a game.

13:09.820 --> 13:15.100
However, in a few cases, that advantage is in play long before the game even starts.

13:15.660 --> 13:20.940
In every sports league, you're bound to run into mismatches, where one competitor is heavily

13:20.940 --> 13:22.540
favored over the other.

13:22.540 --> 13:27.820
While nobody wants to blow a huge lead, it can sometimes prove just as humiliating to

13:27.820 --> 13:30.300
lose to an opponent you're expected to dominate.

13:31.020 --> 13:36.780
Heading into 1990, Mike Tyson was far and away the most feared fighter on the planet.

13:36.780 --> 13:42.940
Boasting an undefeated 37-0 record with 33 knockouts, the heavyweight champion was probably

13:42.940 --> 13:46.460
the closest any fighter has ever been to being truly invincible.

13:47.100 --> 13:53.420
Fans were anticipating him to make quick work of 42-1 long shot Buster Douglas, but to everyone's

13:53.420 --> 13:59.100
shock, the mostly unknown underdog would hand Iron Mike the first loss of his career.

13:59.100 --> 14:04.780
In what is widely considered to be the biggest upset in boxing history, not bad for a guy

14:04.780 --> 14:07.260
who had pretty much been brought in as a jobber.

14:07.900 --> 14:13.340
It turns out that a few other sports make use of jobbers, most notably college football,

14:13.340 --> 14:18.940
whose top teams are notorious for scheduling a few games a year versus cupcake opponents.

14:18.940 --> 14:24.300
University athletic departments have been known to pay six-figure sums for vastly inferior

14:24.300 --> 14:27.260
teams to come into town and get pummeled into the turf.

14:27.820 --> 14:31.340
It's a small price to pay for what should be an automatic victory.

14:31.900 --> 14:36.300
That's certainly what the 2007 Michigan Wolverines were thinking when they scheduled

14:36.300 --> 14:40.460
their opening day contest against the Appalachian State Mountaineers.

14:40.460 --> 14:45.100
Going into the season, Michigan was ranked as the fifth best team in the nation,

14:45.100 --> 14:48.300
and their opponents were quite literally out of their league.

14:48.300 --> 14:54.060
The Mountaineers were a Division I Double-A team, a complete tier beneath Michigan's pedigree.

14:54.060 --> 14:57.260
There would have been no shame if Appalachian State had simply

14:57.260 --> 14:59.580
laid down and accepted their beating.

14:59.580 --> 15:04.540
Unfortunately for Michigan, they were about to learn that there are no free wins in sports.

15:05.580 --> 15:06.860
And the kick is blocked!

15:07.740 --> 15:12.940
Appalachian State has stunned the college football world,

15:12.940 --> 15:16.620
one of the greatest upsets in sports history.

15:17.420 --> 15:21.900
College sports provide ample opportunities for the classic Cinderella story,

15:21.980 --> 15:25.340
a term most frequently used during March Madness.

15:25.340 --> 15:32.060
In Division I basketball, the season champion is decided by a 64-team single-elimination tournament.

15:32.060 --> 15:35.820
The early rounds of the tournament are a breeding ground for memorable upsets,

15:35.820 --> 15:40.300
as the top teams in the country face off against others who are just happy to be there.

15:40.940 --> 15:45.180
Every few years or so, a powerhouse team would get bounced from the tournament by

15:45.180 --> 15:47.260
some school you couldn't even find on a map.

15:47.820 --> 15:54.940
But after 33 years of the 64-team format, a 1-seed had never been defeated by a 16-seed.

15:54.940 --> 16:02.700
That was until 2018, when the 31-2 Virginia Cavaliers faced off against the UMBC Retrievers.

16:03.340 --> 16:08.060
In what may very well have been the most shocking upset in the history of college sports,

16:08.060 --> 16:11.900
Virginia didn't just lose, but got blown out by 20 points.

16:12.540 --> 16:14.780
College sports aren't for everyone,

16:14.780 --> 16:19.740
but you have to admit that they are capable of producing madness that you won't see anywhere else.

16:20.380 --> 16:23.980
However, the most enduring upsets are left to the professionals.

16:24.540 --> 16:30.940
The 2007 New England Patriots are considered by some to be the greatest NFL team ever assembled.

16:30.940 --> 16:36.780
They set all kinds of records and were on track for a perfect season to surpass the 72 Dolphins.

16:37.420 --> 16:42.940
After cruising to the Super Bowl, they faced off against the paltry New York Giants,

16:42.940 --> 16:45.260
a team that hadn't even won their division.

16:45.980 --> 16:51.420
After leading for most of the game, the Patriots were just two minutes away from capping off the

16:51.420 --> 16:58.860
greatest season in NFL history. But hey, those pesky Giants somehow, some way, could not be

16:58.860 --> 17:05.820
stopped. And the mighty Patriots had to settle for 18-1. Every year the Super Bowl is the most

17:05.820 --> 17:12.220
watched broadcast in America, but its viewership pales in comparison to the World Cup, which

17:12.220 --> 17:18.300
consistently attracts an audience of billions. The largest in-person audience for any World Cup

17:18.300 --> 17:25.100
game was estimated to be 220,000 for the 1950 final in Rio de Janeiro, an audience that would

17:25.100 --> 17:30.780
go on to witness one of the most brutal defeats in the history of sports. That year the Brazilian

17:30.780 --> 17:36.380
men's national team looked unstoppable. They had smoked their past two opponents by a combined

17:36.380 --> 17:43.420
score of 13-2 and had only Uruguay standing in the way of their first World Cup. The Brazilians

17:43.420 --> 17:48.460
were so confident in their victory that they had politicians delivering congratulatory speeches

17:48.460 --> 17:54.380
before the game even started. Due to the unusual round-robin format of that year's tournament,

17:54.380 --> 18:00.940
Brazil could draw the game and still win the cup. It seemed simple enough. You have all the momentum

18:00.940 --> 18:06.860
in the world. You are far and away the better team. All you have to do is not lose in your home

18:06.860 --> 18:16.460
stadium and you're the world champions. They lost 2-1. There's an argument to be made that out of

18:16.460 --> 18:23.180
every defeat in the history of sports, this was the single most agonizing. After the game, the

18:23.180 --> 18:29.820
200,000 Brazilians in attendance sat in absolute silence. They weren't just stunned, they were

18:29.820 --> 18:36.460
traumatized. It was reported that in the following moments, multiple fans leapt from the grandstands

18:36.460 --> 18:43.980
to their deaths. This may be hard to understand for non-sports viewers, but some people just really do

18:43.980 --> 18:50.940
care that much about the outcome of a game. As absurd as it may be to say, choking can literally

18:50.940 --> 18:57.100
be a matter of life and death. The biggest upset certainly live up to their name. They can be quite

18:57.100 --> 19:03.020
upsetting to watch. However, these moments don't place as highly on the scale of sorrow when you

19:03.020 --> 19:08.540
consider why they were called upsets in the first place. While the Davids of the sports world may

19:08.540 --> 19:14.460
eke out the occasional fluke win, there's a reason why the Goliaths have earned their title. Apart

19:14.460 --> 19:21.900
from the rare stumble, they tend to win. A lot. After losing to UMBC, Virginia would run it back

19:21.900 --> 19:27.260
and win the tournament the very next season. Mike Tyson would eventually reclaim his heavyweight

19:27.260 --> 19:33.980
title. The Patriots won three more Super Bowls and Brazil won five World Cups. It's safe to say

19:33.980 --> 19:39.660
that most of these guys ended up just fine. When we come back, we'll take a look at chokes so

19:39.660 --> 19:42.940
devastating that no one involved would ever really recover.

19:42.940 --> 19:52.140
Do you realize what could have happened if I hadn't sensed the pit in time?

19:52.780 --> 19:55.340
I suppose you could have choked.

20:00.460 --> 20:04.220
Well everyone, it's the worst time of the year. Football season.

20:04.780 --> 20:09.500
Boy, can't wait to watch the Jaguars suck it up for another four and a half months.

20:09.580 --> 20:15.100
But thankfully, rooting for a future team can suck just a little bit less with today's sponsor,

20:15.740 --> 20:21.100
Bespoke Post. A subscription service that ships out premium goods every month,

20:21.100 --> 20:26.940
or about twice as often as every Jaguars win. Bespoke offers a variety of products ranging

20:26.940 --> 20:33.260
from outdoor, home, cooking, and more. Just take the online quiz to find one that's right for you.

20:33.260 --> 20:39.180
By subscribing, Bespoke will send you a box with $70 worth of stuff for just a fraction of the cost.

20:39.580 --> 20:45.180
Which makes them a far better value than Jaguars tickets. Each month, you get a preview of what's

20:45.180 --> 20:50.060
inside. And unlike your abysmal hometown franchise, if you don't like the product,

20:50.060 --> 20:54.860
you can swap it out for something else or skip the month entirely for no charge.

20:54.860 --> 20:59.900
For football fans, I recommend Bespoke's parked camping chair for your tailgating needs.

20:59.900 --> 21:06.220
And for Jaguars fans specifically, I recommend one of Bespoke's many alcohol-related accessories.

21:06.220 --> 21:12.140
Because God knows you're gonna need it. And who could forget the classic weekender travel bag?

I'm sure that just like Urban Meyer, you'll get a kick out of it. But hey, it's not all doom and

21:31.260 --> 21:36.540
gloom in Jacksonville. In fact, the Jags may have actually figured out the NFL's greatest

21:36.540 --> 21:41.260
new strategy. You can't choke if you're never winning in the first place.

21:49.340 --> 21:53.260
Many children around the world have dreams of becoming a star athlete.

21:53.900 --> 21:58.300
It's an all too common thought to envision yourself scoring the game-winning shot as the

21:58.300 --> 22:05.260
clock expires. What many of us fail to consider, however, is the opposite case. A handful of

22:05.260 --> 22:10.700
athletes do manage to beat the odds and make it to the biggest stage. But rather than having

22:10.700 --> 22:16.140
their dreams come true, they all of a sudden find themselves in the midst of a living nightmare.

22:20.700 --> 22:26.940
Chris Webber had a solid NBA career, but most people only remember him for one costly mistake

22:26.940 --> 22:40.060
that he made in college. Down by two in the final seconds of the championship game, Webber got

22:40.060 --> 22:45.740
caught in a bind and attempted to reset the situation by calling timeout. The only problem

22:45.740 --> 22:51.420
was that his team was out of timeouts, resulting in a technical foul that immediately ended their

22:51.420 --> 22:56.780
chances of victory. It seemed that no matter how much Chris Webber accomplished in the rest of his

22:56.780 --> 23:03.340
basketball career, he could never overcome the stigma of this one miscue. A similar fate would

23:03.340 --> 23:10.140
befall NFL tight end Jackie Smith. In the 1970s, he was one of the best players at his position.

23:10.140 --> 23:15.100
During the 78 season, he was called out of retirement to play for a Dallas Cowboys team

23:15.100 --> 23:21.420
with championship aspirations. That team did end up making it to the Super Bowl, and down by a

23:21.420 --> 23:27.900
score late, quarterback Roger Staubach targeted a wide open Smith in the end zone, who proceeded to

23:27.900 --> 23:39.100
drop the game-tying touchdown. Dallas was forced to settle for a field goal, and that four-point

23:39.100 --> 23:44.220
swing wound up being the difference in the game. Smith's pivotal blunder caused him to be

23:44.220 --> 23:50.140
single-handedly blamed for the defeat. Today, this lone moment is pretty much all he's known for.

23:50.940 --> 23:56.140
Across his Hall of Fame career, Jackie Smith caught 480 passes,

23:56.140 --> 23:59.900
but he is forever doomed to be remembered for the one he dropped.

24:03.100 --> 24:10.780
It can seem rather unjust how much one mistake can ruin someone's legacy. In the 1994 World Cup,

24:10.780 --> 24:16.620
Roberto Baggio was the breakout star of the whole tournament, helping to carry the Italians to the

24:16.620 --> 24:22.140
Finals. But after the game went to penalties when the team needed him most, he sailed his

24:22.140 --> 24:28.860
lone opportunity over the crossbar. The miss would haunt Baggio for years, who is remembered today as

24:28.860 --> 24:34.940
one of the best players to never win the World Cup. In association football, the striker is often the

24:34.940 --> 24:40.540
most revered position on the field. The same can't be said for their American counterparts.

24:41.180 --> 24:46.060
In the NFL, the kicker is one of the most thankless roles that anyone can fill.

24:46.140 --> 24:51.660
We're talking about our idiot kicker. Do your job well and no one bats an eye,

24:51.660 --> 24:56.060
but screw up just once and you will be ridiculed until the cows come home.

24:56.940 --> 25:02.940
In recent history, two of the cruelest misses that come to mind are Blair Walsh's chip-shot shank and

25:02.940 --> 25:08.460
Cody Parkey's double doink. However, the distinction for the costliest miss in NFL

25:08.460 --> 25:14.780
history has to go to one of two incidents from the 90s. Across more than a half century,

25:14.780 --> 25:20.140
four Super Bowls have been decided by a last-second field goal. Three were made,

25:20.140 --> 25:25.740
and one was missed. The dishonor belonged to Buffalo Bills kicker Scott Norwood,

25:25.740 --> 25:30.060
who missed wide right on a 47-yarder that would have won the Bills the title.

25:30.700 --> 25:35.740
It's a moment that has tragically become the most replayed missed field goal of all time.

25:36.460 --> 25:41.660
However, in defense of Norwood, the standard for kickers back then was much less efficient

25:41.660 --> 25:47.980
than what we see today. 47 yards was about at the limit of his range, so the attempt was certainly

25:47.980 --> 25:54.940
no gimme, especially considering the circumstances. For my money, the NFL's actual worst miss occurred

25:54.940 --> 26:02.060
eight years later in the 1998 NFC Championship game. Minnesota Vikings kicker Gary Anderson

26:02.060 --> 26:08.140
had not missed a kick all season, leading by a touchdown with two minutes left. All Anderson

26:08.140 --> 26:13.820
had to do was make one more to put the game out of reach. However, when staring down the most

26:13.820 --> 26:20.700
crucial kick of his life, Anderson could not deliver. And all of a sudden, his perfect season

26:20.700 --> 26:27.020
had turned into the perfect storm. It was just a matter of time before the Vikings' lead was gone,

26:27.020 --> 26:33.420
along with their championship hopes. It can often be difficult for sports fans to reconcile the

26:33.420 --> 26:39.500
complex list of reasons for why their team lost. It's usually far easier to pin the whole mess

26:39.500 --> 26:45.740
on one player and one moment, no matter how unreasonable it may be. This type of coping

26:45.740 --> 26:51.100
mechanism is otherwise known as scapegoating, and in the history of sports, there was perhaps

26:51.100 --> 26:55.340
no bigger scapegoat than Bill Buckner. The nightmares are that you're gonna

26:56.060 --> 26:59.980
let the winning run score on a ground ball through your legs.

27:03.500 --> 27:10.300
Late in Game 6 of the 1986 World Series, Boston Red Sox manager John McNamara made the faithful

27:10.300 --> 27:16.380
decision to leave Buckner in the game at first base. By this point, the 18-year veteran was

27:16.380 --> 27:21.900
well past his prime and would usually be subbed out for a more sure-handed defender in crucial

27:21.900 --> 27:27.740
situations. However, as the elder statesman of the team, Buckner was given the honors to

27:27.740 --> 27:33.500
close out what was anticipated to be a very special moment, leading the New York Mets 5-3

27:33.500 --> 27:38.060
in the bottom of the 10th. The Red Sox were just three outs away from winning their first

27:38.060 --> 27:44.380
championship in nearly 70 years. After retiring the first two batters, relief pitcher Calvin

27:44.380 --> 27:50.460
Schiraldi got into a jam, and the Mets would tie the game off a wild pitch with the bases loaded.

27:51.100 --> 27:56.460
The next batter, Mookie Wilson, appeared to end the inning by hitting a ground ball directly at

27:56.460 --> 28:03.420
Bill Buckner. It's the most routine defensive play in all of baseball, one so elementary that most

28:03.420 --> 28:09.420
children have no problem making it. Bill Buckner had probably done so a thousand times by that

28:09.420 --> 28:16.220
point in his career, but on this day, his glove is a bit loose, his ankles are a tad weak, and he's

28:16.220 --> 28:34.540
not quite the player he used to be. The Red Sox would go on to lose game seven, and the fury of

28:34.540 --> 28:40.220
a tortured fan base would be placed squarely on Bill Buckner's shoulders. The error had made him

28:40.220 --> 28:46.700
a national laughingstock and an absolute outcast in the city of Boston. Buckner had to endure so

28:46.700 --> 28:52.620
much hatred that he eventually had to move his family out to Idaho, where no one knew who he was.

28:53.420 --> 28:58.940
And with that, we've reached a point where chokes stop being so entertaining and stark being pretty

28:58.940 --> 29:05.100
hard to watch. To go back and revisit this footage over and over again, we are prying into what is

29:05.180 --> 29:10.940
quite literally the worst day of someone's life. A moment in which their destiny was profoundly

29:10.940 --> 29:17.020
and permanently altered for the worse. But what if that moment were dragged out just a little bit

29:17.020 --> 29:29.100
longer? For as bad as some of these disasters are, at the very least they come and go in an instant.

29:29.100 --> 29:32.940
The victims aren't given any time to marinate in their active suffering.

29:33.580 --> 29:39.660
Even more terrifying than a single nightmare moment is the meltdown, where an athlete's anguish

29:39.660 --> 29:46.380
is sustained over a much longer time frame. This is no longer your average everyday choking.

29:46.380 --> 29:53.100
This is advanced choking. Golf could be described as one of the loneliest sports of all.

29:53.740 --> 29:59.660
If you screw up, you have no one to blame but yourself. This psychological spell has set the

29:59.660 --> 30:06.140
stage for some of the most epic implosions that any competitors ever experienced. In the 1999

30:06.140 --> 30:11.580
British Open, Jean van de Velde is playing the tournament of his life. He entered the weekend

30:11.580 --> 30:17.420
ranked outside the top 100 players on tour and is now on the cusp of winning one of the sports

30:17.420 --> 30:25.100
crown jewel events. All he has to do is complete the final hole in six strokes. The following 14

30:25.100 --> 30:28.140
minutes can only be described as a real-life horror movie.

30:56.060 --> 31:00.060
I've never seen anything like it before, and to attempt to hit the ball out of there is pure

31:00.060 --> 31:06.700
madness. He's thinking about it, but this is horrendous stuff Alex. No, thank goodness.

31:13.900 --> 31:16.140
I just don't understand what on earth he was doing.

31:16.460 --> 31:21.180
Oh

31:32.460 --> 31:38.540
Van de Velde would eventually finish the 18th hole with a triple bogey seven and would go on to lose

31:38.540 --> 31:44.620
in a playoff. For the rest of his career, he would never even sniff another major tournament win.

31:45.420 --> 31:50.780
Golf may be considered the sport of gentleman, but there are times when it can be absolutely

31:50.780 --> 31:57.020
savage. Three years before Jean van de Velde's meltdown, Greg Norman succumbed to one that was

31:57.020 --> 32:04.620
even worse. If you thought one hole of misery was bad, you should see it prolonged over an entire

32:04.620 --> 32:10.700
round. Norman entered the final day of the 1996 Masters with a commanding six-stroke lead.

32:11.260 --> 32:16.620
Over the course of that Sunday afternoon, that lead would slowly and steadily evaporate into

32:16.620 --> 32:21.500
nothingness. It was like watching a wayward sailor drift at sea in a sinking ship.

32:22.220 --> 32:28.540
There was no saving him. In about three hours, Norman's six-stroke lead had disintegrated into

32:28.540 --> 32:35.900
a five-stroke deficit. By the end of it all, he wasn't even close to winning. One bad play can be

32:35.900 --> 32:41.900
written off as an outlier. Several in a row can be chalked up to some bad luck, but to suddenly

32:41.900 --> 32:47.820
lose your god-given abilities for an entire game, you just might have to start believing in curses.

32:48.780 --> 32:55.580
One fan base very familiar with curses is that of the Chicago Cubs, who by 2003 had experienced

32:55.580 --> 33:01.740
nearly a century of futility. In that season's NLCS, they finally looked on track to reverse

33:01.740 --> 33:07.660
their fortunes. After shutting out the Florida Marlins for the first seven innings of game six,

33:07.660 --> 33:12.780
the Cubs were just five outs away from a long-awaited return to the World Series.

33:12.780 --> 33:19.420
But after Cubs fan Steve Bartman crossed paths with a chance foul ball, it was as if fate itself

33:19.420 --> 33:25.100
had flipped a switch. The Cubs, who had controlled the entire game to that point, had just been

33:25.100 --> 33:27.100
transported to the inning from hell.

33:56.060 --> 34:03.420
Three runs are going to score on a double by Mordecai, and this crowd at Wrigley Field stunned

34:03.420 --> 34:10.860
in disbelief. Baseball is one of the only sports with no time limit, meaning that the potential for

34:10.860 --> 34:17.900
suffering is theoretically infinite. After watching their victory disappear before their eyes, Cubs

34:17.900 --> 34:23.420
fans must have been wondering if the tournament would ever end. It turned out that the old curse

34:23.420 --> 34:29.660
was there to stay for just a bit longer. At the turn of the 21st century, the only other baseball

34:29.660 --> 34:35.340
team as misfortunate as the Cubs were our old friends, the Red Sox. Not only did they have a

34:35.340 --> 34:40.620
generational championship drought of their own, they had to sit and watch as their bitter rivals

34:40.620 --> 34:46.220
became the most successful franchise in all of sports. Throughout the 20th century, the Red Sox

34:46.220 --> 34:52.700
had almost too many heartbreaks to count, with one of the absolute worst taking place in the 1978

34:52.700 --> 34:59.260
season. On the morning of July 20th, the Red Sox led the American League standings by a staggering

34:59.260 --> 35:06.460
14-game margin over the Yankees. By September, Boston's lead had dwindled to just four games,

35:06.460 --> 35:11.980
just as they were slated to face the Yankees in a four-game series. The Red Sox ended up getting

35:11.980 --> 35:18.460
swept so badly that the performance went on to be known as the Boston Massacre. Just like that, the

35:18.460 --> 35:24.940
14-game lead had vanished, and the Yankees had tied them in the standings. After squandering the

35:24.940 --> 35:30.540
entire advantage they once had, the Red Sox were given one last opportunity to right the ship,

35:31.100 --> 35:36.540
a regular season tiebreaker in their home stadium, with the winner advancing to the postseason.

35:37.180 --> 35:43.260
However, any chance of redemption would soon be foiled when Bucky Dent, a player who'd only hit

35:43.260 --> 35:48.540
four home runs that entire season, blasted a three-run shot that ended up winning the game

35:48.540 --> 35:55.340
for the Yankees. Boston was once again left in the dust and would have to watch their nemesis win yet

35:55.340 --> 36:02.700
another championship. Late season collapses are probably the most long-form meltdowns in all of

36:02.700 --> 36:09.100
sports, but in a season as long as baseball's, they're not unprecedented. If you want to know the

36:09.100 --> 36:14.540
absolute nastiest chokes that sports have to offer, you will find them in an exclusive

36:14.540 --> 36:25.980
collection of moments that were truly one of a kind. When it comes to ripping your heart out,

36:25.980 --> 36:32.860
these are the cream of the crop. At long last, we have arrived at the Chernobyl of sports disasters.

36:32.860 --> 36:39.660
A handful of events that, no matter how many times you watch, still seem inconceivable. We've

36:39.660 --> 36:45.740
talked about missed field goals before, but there's one particular miss that I've neglected to discuss

36:45.740 --> 36:53.740
until now. In the NFL, desperation plays are rarely ever successful, but in a 2003 game between the

36:53.740 --> 36:59.980
Saints and Jaguars, New Orleans scored one of the only multilateral touchdowns of the 21st century.

37:00.700 --> 37:06.060
Now, the uninitiated out there may think that we have finally uncovered the elusive Jacksonville

37:06.060 --> 37:16.460
Jaguars choke, but rest assured, the real choke was yet to come. He missed the extra point wide

37:16.460 --> 37:23.100
right. After one of the most sensational plays in recent memory, Saints kicker John Carney missed

37:23.100 --> 37:30.540
the extra point, a kick which at the time had almost a 99% success rate. The River City Relay

37:30.540 --> 37:36.140
would ultimately be in vain, and like most things in Jacksonville, would be pretty much forgotten.

37:36.780 --> 37:41.660
Believe it or not though, there are still more painful ways to lose a football game.

37:41.660 --> 37:48.140
To find out how, we have to once again visit our favorite college chokers, the Michigan Wolverines,

37:48.140 --> 37:52.540
whose football program never really recovered from the loss to Appalachian State.

37:53.180 --> 37:59.260
In 2015, Michigan looked to turn things around by hiring former NFL head coach Jim Harbaugh.

37:59.820 --> 38:06.060
Suffice to say, his tenure thus far hasn't quite lived up to expectations. We could have seen it

38:06.060 --> 38:12.380
coming had we paid attention to a particular omen from his first season in charge. With just 10

38:12.380 --> 38:18.140
seconds left, the Wolverines have a two-point lead against rival Michigan State. All they have

38:18.140 --> 38:35.340
to do to win is run one successful punt. And well, I think this guy's expression says it all.

38:36.300 --> 38:42.140
But for as frustrating as this was to watch, there is still one loss in the history of American

38:42.140 --> 38:50.620
football that is even more inexcusable. On November 19, 1978, the New York Giants

38:50.620 --> 38:57.580
are leading the Philadelphia Eagles 17-12 with just 30 seconds to play. The Giants have the ball,

38:57.580 --> 39:03.900
and the Eagles have no timeouts. Theoretically, losing from this position should be impossible.

39:03.900 --> 39:10.140
But for some godforsaken reason, the Giants are going to find a way to do so. Funnily enough,

39:10.140 --> 39:15.500
their demise would come almost entirely from the NFL's weird problem with kneeling,

39:15.500 --> 39:21.340
and not the kind you're probably thinking of. In the modern-day game, it is customary for teams

39:21.340 --> 39:26.940
to close out their final possession in victory formation, where the quarterback simply touches

39:26.940 --> 39:32.620
his knee to the ground and runs out the rest of the clock. But back in the day, many people in

39:32.620 --> 39:39.100
the league took issue to intentionally downing the ball, going so far as to call it unsportsmanlike.

39:39.100 --> 39:43.980
Because of this, the foolproof strategy was sometimes disregarded in favor of a more

39:43.980 --> 39:50.140
conventional play. All quarterback Joe Pisserchik had to do was drop to the ground and the Giants

39:50.140 --> 39:56.380
were home free. However, offensive coordinator Bob Gibson insisted on running a handoff.

39:56.940 --> 40:02.940
When the play call came in, the Giants players were in disbelief, with running back Larry Zonka

40:02.940 --> 40:08.540
outright refusing to take the ball. But after Gibson threatened to cut Pisserchik if he

40:08.540 --> 40:15.420
disobeyed the order, the play went on as planned. And well, there's a reason why every team today

40:15.420 --> 40:27.260
just takes a knee. The Eagles scored the game-winning touchdown from a fumble that

40:27.260 --> 40:33.020
shouldn't even have been a possibility. Giants fans were so irate that many ended up throwing

40:33.020 --> 40:39.580
the next game's tickets into a bonfire. Bob Gibson was axed the next morning and was never hired to

40:39.580 --> 40:45.180
coach at any level of football ever again. Perhaps the most fitting thing of all was the player who

40:45.180 --> 40:50.700
scored that touchdown. Most of you watching may not recognize him, but if you've been following

40:50.700 --> 40:57.260
along, this is someone we've already met long ago. And his wisdom rang just as true all the way

40:57.260 --> 41:05.340
back then. Players and coaches that get labeled as chokers don't tend to stick around for very long,

41:05.340 --> 41:11.020
but ever so often you'll find one that does. An exceptional talent who can just never have things

41:11.020 --> 41:16.780
work out for them in the end. This type of competitor is otherwise known as a choke artist,

41:16.780 --> 41:24.060
the most notable of which has to be NBA point guard Chris Paul. In 14 playoff appearances,

41:24.060 --> 41:31.980
Paul has managed to blow a 3-2 lead, a 3-1 lead, and a jaw-dropping 5-2-0 leads. No matter which

41:31.980 --> 41:38.220
team he plays for, postseason success is always just out of reach. One of those teams was the

41:38.220 --> 41:43.900
2018 Houston Rockets, who finished the regular season at the top of the Western Conference

41:43.900 --> 41:49.900
standings ahead of the formidable Golden State Warriors. The Warriors had taken the league by

41:49.900 --> 41:55.340
storm after becoming extremely efficient at shooting three-pointers. Rockets general manager

41:55.340 --> 42:00.060
Daryl Morey could see the tide turning and constructed a roster designed to beat the

42:00.060 --> 42:05.900
Warriors at their own game. The two teams were on a collision course that would ultimately be decided

42:05.900 --> 42:11.820
in game seven of the conference finals. Leading by 12 in the second quarter, the Rockets would

42:11.820 --> 42:18.060
enter the most unholy stretch of basketball that any team has ever witnessed. In the next 23

42:18.060 --> 42:25.180
minutes of game time, the Rockets missed 27 threes in a row. That year, the Rockets were having the

42:25.180 --> 42:30.700
most productive three-point shooting season in history. They had made over 36 percent of their

42:30.700 --> 42:38.940
attempts. The odds of this team missing 27 in a row was about 1 in 186,000. And for it to happen

42:38.940 --> 42:45.500
at the absolute worst possible time, that's a level of cruelty I cannot even begin to describe.

42:46.220 --> 42:51.900
It's one thing to cost yourself the game off some incompetent mistake, but at least in that

42:51.900 --> 42:57.820
case you get to blame it on something. What's truly demoralizing is being defeated by nothing

42:57.820 --> 43:04.940
more than the cold indifference of chance. If you think that 1 in 186,000 are rough odds,

43:04.940 --> 43:09.500
they don't even come close to the level of misfortune that Toronto Blue Jays pitcher Dave

43:09.500 --> 43:16.060
Steeve experienced in September of 1988. One of the greatest achievements for any pitcher is the

43:16.060 --> 43:23.740
no-hitter. In the 150-year history of the majors, only 317 have ever been thrown. At the end of the

43:23.740 --> 43:30.140
88 season, Dave Steeve had two consecutive no-hitters blown up on the last possible out.

43:30.700 --> 43:36.940
Sports writer John Boyce estimated that the chance of this happening was 1 in 241 million,

43:37.580 --> 43:43.020
but that still may not be as unlikely as what happened in the world of motorsports on May 29,

43:43.020 --> 43:49.980
2011. Many consider the last Sunday in May to be the greatest day in racing. In the United States,

43:49.980 --> 43:57.260
it features two long-standing traditions, starting at noon with the Indy 500, whose 2011 running saw

43:57.260 --> 44:04.060
rookie J.R. Hildebrand one lap away from victory. In the final corner, he misjudged a pass on a

44:04.060 --> 44:10.380
lapped car and crashed, allowing second-place Dan Weldon to steal the win on the final straightaway.

44:10.380 --> 44:16.380
The sponsor of Hildebrand's car was the National Guard, who just so happened to be sponsoring Dale

44:16.380 --> 44:22.540
Earnhardt Jr.'s car in the Coke 600 that evening. As Earnhardt found himself leading on the final

44:22.540 --> 44:38.460
lap, the National Guard car would experience deja vu. In an astounding coincidence, two separate

44:38.460 --> 44:43.740
drivers with the same sponsor would lose their respective races in the final turn of the final

44:43.740 --> 44:53.740
lap. A remarkable case of synchronized choking. Can choking really manifest itself on a macroscopic

44:53.740 --> 44:59.740
level? If so, the best evidence of it happening would have to be the wildest time in the history

44:59.740 --> 45:07.820
of American sports, 2016, otherwise known as the year of the choke. It started in the NBA Western

45:07.820 --> 45:14.700
Conference Finals, where the Oklahoma City Thunder blew a 3-1 series lead to the Golden State Warriors.

45:14.700 --> 45:19.900
After advancing to the finals, the Warriors proceeded to blow a 3-1 lead against the Cleveland

45:19.900 --> 45:26.140
Cavaliers. Five months later in the World Series, the Cleveland Indians blew a 3-1 lead to the

45:26.140 --> 45:33.500
Chicago Cubs, who finally ended their century-long championship drought. Two championship collapses in

45:33.500 --> 45:40.140
the same sports season was almost unprecedented, but the worst was still yet to come. Three months

45:40.140 --> 45:46.380
after the World Series, the Atlanta Falcons orchestrated the worst choke in Super Bowl history,

45:46.380 --> 45:53.180
blowing a 28-3 lead to the New England Patriots. In a span of just eight months, all three major

45:53.180 --> 45:59.420
American sports saw their champions crown through the ashes of historic chokes, a feat that will

45:59.420 --> 46:05.660
probably never happen again. Of course, I would be remiss if I didn't mention a certain other

46:05.660 --> 46:11.180
choke that happened in the United States at around the same time, in what has very much become our

46:11.180 --> 46:17.980
country's new most popular sport. But out of the prior three, the Falcons choke has to be the most

46:17.980 --> 46:24.700
iconic. However, I personally consider the Warriors choke to be the most historically fascinating.

46:24.700 --> 46:30.780
That season, the Warriors broke a record that few thought was possible. Their 73 regular season

46:30.780 --> 46:36.460
wins were the most in NBA history, and we would probably look back on them as the greatest team

46:36.460 --> 46:42.300
ever if they hadn't choked in the finals. Their defeat completed one of the strangest statistical

46:42.300 --> 46:49.180
oddities in all of sports. Combined with the 96 Red Wings, the 01 Mariners, and the 07 Patriots,

46:49.180 --> 46:54.460
the best regular season team from each of the big four U.S. sports leagues has failed to win

46:54.460 --> 47:01.180
the championship. The Warriors have had no shortage of winning since, but that missing ring still looms

47:01.180 --> 47:08.860
as a big blemish on an otherwise dominant dynasty. In sports, blowing a 3-1 lead is pretty uncommon.

47:08.860 --> 47:15.500
Blowing an 8-1 lead sounds almost unfathomable. The competitive yacht racing championship features

47:15.500 --> 47:23.500
a best-of-17 series. And in the 2013 running, Team New Zealand led Team USA eight races to one.

47:24.220 --> 47:29.580
Needing only a single victory in the next eight to clinch the title, New Zealand would go on to

47:29.580 --> 47:35.820
lose each and every one. In terms of sheer magnitude, no other choke in sports even comes

47:35.820 --> 47:41.980
close. But if you're asking me about the absolute greatest choke of all time, there is one other

47:41.980 --> 47:48.780
that tops it. While an 8-1 choke is truly mind-blowing, I still prefer the simple elegance of

47:48.780 --> 47:55.980
the 3-0 choke, the fabled reverse sweep. Everyone knows baseball as one of those sports that's so old.

47:55.980 --> 48:02.620
Pretty much any feat you can imagine has already been done long ago. But as of the 2004 season,

48:02.620 --> 48:09.980
no team had ever come back from a three games to none series deficit. 2004 marked year 86 of

48:09.980 --> 48:15.900
misery for the Boston Red Sox, who looked to once again have their hopes and dreams shattered by the

48:15.900 --> 48:21.420
New York Yankees. There had been Red Sox fans who lived and died without ever once seeing their

48:21.420 --> 48:28.140
beloved team win it all. All they had ever known was non-stop heartbreak, countless opportunities

48:28.140 --> 48:34.860
utterly wasted. By this point, the outcome seemed like a foregone conclusion. The Red Sox are getting

48:34.860 --> 48:40.940
crushed again. Their last sliver of hope relies on doing something that had never been done before

48:40.940 --> 48:48.060
in the history of their sport. It all comes down to this, the Boston Red Sox versus the rest of time.

48:55.100 --> 49:00.940
You know thus far I've only really shown chokes in a negative light. I've described them as brutal,

49:00.940 --> 49:06.700
cruel, and agonizing. But very rarely you'll encounter those ethereal moments when a choke is

49:06.700 --> 49:11.900
actually quite beautiful, where all the broken pieces just managed to fit together in the most

49:11.900 --> 49:18.860
perfect way. It's like poetry in motion, a surreal window into someplace else where great things

49:18.860 --> 49:26.140
really can happen. The truth is that outside of the sports world, most of us are losers. It can seem

49:26.140 --> 49:33.020
like whatever success we do find always manages to slip away. In a society that seems to value

49:33.020 --> 49:39.900
winning above all else, it's a tough pill to swallow. Losing is as undesirable as it is universal.

49:40.620 --> 49:46.540
It's hard to find a feeling more relatable. No matter how good you are, everyone has to

49:46.540 --> 49:51.980
lose eventually. In sports, it's easy to get caught up in the ruthless pursuit of glory.

49:52.620 --> 49:58.780
At times it can feel downright nihilistic. Perhaps the reason we find chokes so compelling is that

49:58.780 --> 50:04.140
they're the closest winners and losers ever get to each other. They remind us that not even the

50:04.140 --> 50:10.220
greatest winners can outrun the inevitability of defeat. It's the reason we watch and the reason

50:10.220 --> 50:16.780
we play. If the woeful Red Sox could come back against the mighty Yankees, who knows what else

50:16.780 --> 50:21.500
is possible.

50:21.500 --> 50:48.220
The Yankees, who are the storied franchise as we all know, are now at a dark hour because they just

50:48.220 --> 50:56.060
took the worst defeat not only in my lifetime as a Yankee fan, I think without question the worst

50:56.060 --> 51:03.820
defeat in their history. Now whenever you see a team go down 3-0 in any sport, they will put up

51:03.820 --> 51:11.420
a graphic on television which will say 2004 Red Sox down 3-0 beat New York Yankees. This is now

51:11.420 --> 51:16.540
part of sports history and every guy who's got a team down when it's back to the walls is going

51:16.540 --> 51:22.620
to talk about the Red Sox for the next 30 years.
