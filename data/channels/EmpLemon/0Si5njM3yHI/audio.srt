1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:22,180
I get asked all the time why I watch sports, and to tell you the truth, the thrill of competition

2
00:00:22,180 --> 00:00:35,140
comes down to two very simple things, the euphoria of victory and the agony of defeat.

3
00:00:35,140 --> 00:00:42,400
A wise man once said, you play to win the game, a quotation so blunt that many may find

4
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:48,060
it humorous, but if you look past the literal denotation of the statement, it serves more

5
00:00:48,060 --> 00:00:52,980
to punctuate the harsh reality of what it truly means to compete.

6
00:00:52,980 --> 00:00:56,700
When you get right down to it, sports are brutal.

7
00:00:56,700 --> 00:01:01,820
After you strip away all the fame and fortune of being a professional athlete, history only

8
00:01:01,820 --> 00:01:07,700
cares about two things, how much you won and how much you lost.

9
00:01:07,700 --> 00:01:12,660
As sports fans, we often like to craft little narratives around players and teams, feel

10
00:01:12,660 --> 00:01:16,660
good stories to make them seem a bit more like a protagonist.

11
00:01:16,660 --> 00:01:22,420
In this day and age, everyone's looking for a hero, and unfortunately, this is the point

12
00:01:22,420 --> 00:01:25,420
where sports deviates from fiction.

13
00:01:25,420 --> 00:01:29,600
Because at the end of the day, when all the chips are down, it doesn't matter how much

14
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:35,620
you tried, how far you came or how well you treated everyone else, all will be forgotten

15
00:01:35,620 --> 00:01:37,800
if you fail to win.

16
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:43,060
And unfortunately for our heroes, there's just not a lot of winning to go around.

17
00:01:43,060 --> 00:01:49,100
The vast majority of competitors are doomed to retire as nothing more than forgotten losers.

18
00:01:49,100 --> 00:01:52,520
But not every loser is necessarily forgettable.

19
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:58,540
As it turns out, there are many ways to lose in sports, some more spectacular than others.

20
00:01:58,540 --> 00:02:03,580
You can throw a game on purpose, get cheated out of a win by the refs, or get blown out

21
00:02:03,580 --> 00:02:08,100
so badly that it makes everyone question what game you were even playing.

22
00:02:08,140 --> 00:02:13,900
However, if you truly want to be remembered in defeat, look no further than the most painful

23
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:17,180
way to lose in all of sports, the choke.

24
00:02:38,100 --> 00:02:52,840
In 1990, the International Atomic Energy Agency introduced a tiered scale for the purpose

25
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:56,480
of categorizing the severity of nuclear meltdowns.

26
00:02:56,480 --> 00:03:01,440
For the purpose of this video, I believe that a similar scale is apropos for chronicling

27
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:04,460
the worst meltdowns in sports.

28
00:03:04,460 --> 00:03:08,520
Watching these moments unfold is truly a surreal experience.

29
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:13,180
There's something about it that's so morbid yet compelling, like witnessing a train wreck

30
00:03:13,180 --> 00:03:14,780
in slow motion.

31
00:03:14,780 --> 00:03:20,220
To have victory within your grasp just to let it slip away, it evokes strange feelings

32
00:03:20,220 --> 00:03:22,240
of existential dread.

33
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:25,900
But alas, not all chokes are created equal.

34
00:03:25,900 --> 00:03:28,920
Some are much more dreadful than others.

35
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:31,180
Let's start off with the least dreadful.

36
00:03:35,020 --> 00:03:39,260
The fundamental building block of every choke is the common blooper.

37
00:03:39,260 --> 00:03:43,900
Professional athletes are among the best of the best in strength, speed, and skill, but

38
00:03:43,900 --> 00:03:47,300
they're still susceptible to the occasional malfunction.

39
00:03:47,300 --> 00:03:52,700
If you play for long enough, you will eventually be served your fair share of humble pie.

40
00:03:52,700 --> 00:03:57,660
While the average blooper is often forgotten, a few manage to stand the test of time for

41
00:03:57,660 --> 00:03:59,660
their sheer absurdity.

42
00:03:59,660 --> 00:04:05,060
Jose Canseco was a baseball player who wasn't exactly known for using his head.

43
00:04:05,060 --> 00:04:10,140
That was until a 1993 game, when a lucky bounce off the cranium helped to score what may have

44
00:04:10,140 --> 00:04:13,820
been the only dome run in the history of the majors.

45
00:04:13,820 --> 00:04:18,500
It's unclear whether this moment was more embarrassing than what happened to Larry Walker,

46
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:22,300
who forgot how to count to three in the middle of a 1994 game.

47
00:04:22,300 --> 00:04:25,980
And Walker doesn't know how many outs there were.

48
00:04:25,980 --> 00:04:28,220
He thought that was the third out.

49
00:04:28,220 --> 00:04:34,220
Even more perplexing are some of the bloopers found in America's most popular sport, the NFL,

50
00:04:34,220 --> 00:04:39,100
whose most infamous gaffes have approached Looney Tunes' levels of contrivance.

51
00:04:39,100 --> 00:04:43,580
In 2012, a game between the New York Jets and the New England Patriots produced what

52
00:04:43,580 --> 00:04:49,900
may be the most notorious folly in recent memory, the butt fumble, a play so humiliating

53
00:04:49,980 --> 00:04:53,740
that the Jets franchise has still never quite recovered.

54
00:04:53,740 --> 00:04:58,700
It's pretty much the blooper to end all bloopers, and has since overshadowed several other strong

55
00:04:58,700 --> 00:05:01,420
contenders for the dumbest of all time.

56
00:05:01,420 --> 00:05:08,780
In 1964, Minnesota Vikings defender Jim Marshall scooped up a fumble and ran 75 yards for the score.

57
00:05:08,780 --> 00:05:12,300
The only problem was that he scored for the other team.

58
00:05:12,300 --> 00:05:15,820
Marshall had just carried the ball in the wrong direction.

59
00:05:15,820 --> 00:05:21,260
In 2008, Detroit Lions quarterback Dan Rolovski would show a similar lack of awareness by

60
00:05:21,260 --> 00:05:24,460
obliviously trotting out of the back of the end zone.

61
00:05:24,460 --> 00:05:30,300
That 08 Lions roster would end up becoming the first team to finish a season 0-16,

62
00:05:30,300 --> 00:05:36,860
the polar opposites of the 1972 Miami Dolphins, who finished a perfect 17-0.

63
00:05:36,860 --> 00:05:42,380
Strangely enough, this all-time great season culminated in what may very well be the ugliest

64
00:05:42,380 --> 00:05:44,620
blooper in the history of American football.

65
00:05:45,820 --> 00:05:55,660
With two minutes to go in the Super Bowl, kicker Gero Yapremian was sent out to ice

66
00:05:55,660 --> 00:05:57,820
the game with a long field goal.

67
00:05:57,820 --> 00:06:03,100
In what looked to be a moment of serendipity, the Dolphins had a chance to end their 17-0

68
00:06:03,100 --> 00:06:05,980
season with a 17-0 victory.

69
00:06:05,980 --> 00:06:11,500
However, Yapremian was about to show that the 72 Dolphins were not all perfect.

70
00:06:11,900 --> 00:06:29,900
Despite the pitiful comedy of errors on that play, the Dolphins hung on to complete what

71
00:06:29,900 --> 00:06:35,420
is thus far the only undefeated season in the Super Bowl era, and Gero's ridiculous

72
00:06:35,420 --> 00:06:38,060
folly would be forgiven and forgotten.

73
00:06:38,060 --> 00:06:43,660
It just goes to show, winning is all it takes to bail you out of a truly hideous situation.

74
00:06:44,300 --> 00:06:48,380
Most of the other stories on this list wish that they could have been as fortunate.

75
00:06:53,340 --> 00:06:57,740
On their own, bloopers, errors, and mistakes are mostly inconsequential.

76
00:06:58,300 --> 00:07:04,300
Sports are largely governed by averages, and one bad play is typically not enough to sway

77
00:07:04,300 --> 00:07:06,380
the outcome of a game or a season.

78
00:07:07,020 --> 00:07:12,140
The same can't be said about this next kind of goof, the premature celebration.

79
00:07:15,580 --> 00:07:20,780
It's easy to clown athletes for a shameful moment, but there are also times when pride

80
00:07:20,780 --> 00:07:22,540
is just as dangerous.

81
00:07:22,540 --> 00:07:27,740
Everyone knows the story of the tortoise and the hare, but this age-old tale always manages

82
00:07:27,740 --> 00:07:30,220
to slip the mind of a few athletes per year.

83
00:07:30,780 --> 00:07:35,260
Throughout the history of sports, there are numerous examples of players losing through

84
00:07:35,260 --> 00:07:37,100
nothing else but their own hubris.

85
00:07:37,740 --> 00:07:43,260
As shown in the fable, racing often serves as the backdrop for many improbable defeats.

86
00:07:43,900 --> 00:07:49,660
In 2015, track and field athlete Tanjoy Pepiad was too focused on gesturing to the crowd

87
00:07:49,660 --> 00:07:53,100
to notice his competitors stealing the victory from under his nose.

88
00:07:53,660 --> 00:07:57,980
In 2004, a similar fate befell Superbike racer Sean Emmett.

89
00:07:58,620 --> 00:08:03,180
Perhaps the most painful homestretch fail would happen to Olympic snowboarder Lindsay

90
00:08:03,180 --> 00:08:08,060
Jacob Ellis, who would kiss the gold medal goodbye after a showboating stunt sent her

91
00:08:08,060 --> 00:08:09,340
tumbling into the snow.

92
00:08:09,900 --> 00:08:14,300
Moments like these prove the time-honored wisdom that you should never celebrate until

93
00:08:14,300 --> 00:08:19,660
after you cross the finish line, or in the case of American football, the end zone.

94
00:08:20,700 --> 00:08:26,140
It's a sport which has seen an alarming number of cases where a celebrating player has inexplicably

95
00:08:26,140 --> 00:08:31,180
dropped the ball at the one-yard line, thus invalidating what should have been a guaranteed

96
00:08:31,180 --> 00:08:31,500
score.

97
00:08:32,140 --> 00:08:37,500
One such case that's particularly hard to watch happened in a 2014 college game between

98
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:38,620
Utah and Oregon.

99
00:08:39,180 --> 00:08:45,340
After the Utah receiver let go of a surefire touchdown, Oregon returned in 99 yards the

100
00:08:45,340 --> 00:08:50,300
other way, a 14-point swing, all from one careless mistake.

101
00:08:50,860 --> 00:08:55,820
It's a mistake so punishing you'd think that any player would learn to never do it again.

102
00:08:56,700 --> 00:09:02,940
Well, any player besides DeSean Jackson, who dropped the ball not once, but twice in his

103
00:09:02,940 --> 00:09:03,420
career.

104
00:09:03,980 --> 00:09:07,980
Perhaps the most famous case of dropping the ball came on the biggest stage.

105
00:09:08,620 --> 00:09:14,460
In Super Bowl 27, Leon Letts hot dogging allowed an opposing player to catch up and strip the

106
00:09:14,460 --> 00:09:15,740
ball before he scored.

107
00:09:16,300 --> 00:09:21,180
Nine months later, with the Super Bowl blunders still fresh in everyone's mind, Leon would

108
00:09:21,180 --> 00:09:22,700
somehow manage to top it.

109
00:09:23,260 --> 00:09:28,460
In a Thanksgiving Day game against the Dolphins, a blocked field goal at the end of regulation

110
00:09:28,460 --> 00:09:30,780
left the whole Cowboys sideline celebrating.

111
00:09:31,420 --> 00:09:36,300
Unfortunately, another inexplicable botch would render that celebration premature.

112
00:09:53,260 --> 00:09:59,900
It's safe to say that after this, both Leon and the Cowboys were reminded of the most

113
00:09:59,900 --> 00:10:02,220
fundamental law in competition.

114
00:10:02,220 --> 00:10:03,900
It ain't over till it's over.

115
00:10:05,260 --> 00:10:11,020
Sports can be truly chaotic and there is very little that can be confidently excluded from

116
00:10:11,020 --> 00:10:13,260
the possible range of outcomes.

117
00:10:13,260 --> 00:10:18,460
As someone who spends a lot of time watching a losing team, I often find myself imagining

118
00:10:18,460 --> 00:10:22,620
a hypothetical list of events that would have to occur for them to actually win.

119
00:10:23,260 --> 00:10:27,340
The more they're getting beat, the more preposterous that list becomes.

120
00:10:27,340 --> 00:10:32,220
But would that imaginary comeback be impossible or just improbable?

121
00:10:32,220 --> 00:10:37,180
In other words, at what point does a deficit become truly insurmountable?

122
00:10:37,180 --> 00:10:42,380
We may never know for sure how big of a lead is safe, but we do know which ones are not.

123
00:10:42,380 --> 00:10:53,420
On April 21st, 2012, the Boston Red Sox got out to a 9-0 lead against their arch rivals,

124
00:10:53,420 --> 00:10:54,620
the New York Yankees.

125
00:10:55,180 --> 00:11:00,380
Just three innings later, the Yankees had scored 15 straight runs, flipping the script

126
00:11:00,380 --> 00:11:03,260
on what surely looked like a Boston blowout.

127
00:11:03,260 --> 00:11:08,540
It was one of the biggest swings in any baseball game ever, and it fell just short of the biggest

128
00:11:08,540 --> 00:11:09,500
outright comeback.

129
00:11:10,060 --> 00:11:16,380
Three times in MLB history has a team blown a 12-run lead, the most recent being the 2001

130
00:11:16,380 --> 00:11:22,060
Seattle Mariners, who allowed the Cleveland Indians to crawl all the way back from a 14-2

131
00:11:22,060 --> 00:11:22,620
deficit.

132
00:11:23,180 --> 00:11:29,100
The largest blown lead in basketball history belongs to the 1996 Denver Nuggets, who were

133
00:11:29,100 --> 00:11:32,460
unable to close out a 36-point cushion.

134
00:11:32,460 --> 00:11:37,900
In 1957, Huddersfield Town would blow the biggest single-game lead of any football club.

135
00:11:38,460 --> 00:11:44,300
After building a towering 5-1 margin with just 27 minutes to play, the Terriers would

136
00:11:44,300 --> 00:11:48,620
somehow go on to blow a 4-goal lead, losing 6-7.

137
00:11:49,260 --> 00:11:55,980
In ice hockey, numerous NHL teams have managed to blow a 5-goal lead, including Wayne Gretzky's

138
00:11:55,980 --> 00:12:01,980
Edmonton Oilers, who couldn't hang on to a 5-0 lead in a 1982 playoff game.

139
00:12:01,980 --> 00:12:06,860
Coincidentally, the biggest comeback in NFL history would also befall the Oilers in a

140
00:12:06,860 --> 00:12:13,180
playoff game, who squandered an almost unthinkable 35-3 lead to the Buffalo Bills.

141
00:12:13,180 --> 00:12:17,740
Statistically speaking, these games are all candidates for the worst-ever choke of their

142
00:12:17,740 --> 00:12:23,740
respective sports, but considering the full context in which they occurred, few are remembered

143
00:12:23,740 --> 00:12:24,300
as such.

144
00:12:24,860 --> 00:12:29,660
Most of these losses just didn't end up mattering in the grand scheme of things, relegating

145
00:12:29,660 --> 00:12:35,180
them to probabilistic anomalies, mere trivia for a number of obsessed geeks.

146
00:12:35,180 --> 00:12:39,580
They don't really come to mind when the average sports fan thinks of the most gut-wrenching

147
00:12:39,580 --> 00:12:39,980
chokes.

148
00:12:40,620 --> 00:12:45,340
As the INES would say, they were disasters with only local consequences.

149
00:12:45,900 --> 00:12:50,780
If we want to find some truly epic chokes, we're gonna need some bigger fish to fry.

150
00:12:56,380 --> 00:13:01,580
It's fairly agreed upon in sports jargon that the term choke describes when a team or player

151
00:13:01,580 --> 00:13:03,500
has exhausted a massive advantage.

152
00:13:04,140 --> 00:13:08,860
In most circumstances, it refers to an advantage that has been built up over the course of

153
00:13:08,860 --> 00:13:09,260
a game.

154
00:13:09,820 --> 00:13:15,100
However, in a few cases, that advantage is in play long before the game even starts.

155
00:13:15,660 --> 00:13:20,940
In every sports league, you're bound to run into mismatches, where one competitor is heavily

156
00:13:20,940 --> 00:13:22,540
favored over the other.

157
00:13:22,540 --> 00:13:27,820
While nobody wants to blow a huge lead, it can sometimes prove just as humiliating to

158
00:13:27,820 --> 00:13:30,300
lose to an opponent you're expected to dominate.

159
00:13:31,020 --> 00:13:36,780
Heading into 1990, Mike Tyson was far and away the most feared fighter on the planet.

160
00:13:36,780 --> 00:13:42,940
Boasting an undefeated 37-0 record with 33 knockouts, the heavyweight champion was probably

161
00:13:42,940 --> 00:13:46,460
the closest any fighter has ever been to being truly invincible.

162
00:13:47,100 --> 00:13:53,420
Fans were anticipating him to make quick work of 42-1 long shot Buster Douglas, but to everyone's

163
00:13:53,420 --> 00:13:59,100
shock, the mostly unknown underdog would hand Iron Mike the first loss of his career.

164
00:13:59,100 --> 00:14:04,780
In what is widely considered to be the biggest upset in boxing history, not bad for a guy

165
00:14:04,780 --> 00:14:07,260
who had pretty much been brought in as a jobber.

166
00:14:07,900 --> 00:14:13,340
It turns out that a few other sports make use of jobbers, most notably college football,

167
00:14:13,340 --> 00:14:18,940
whose top teams are notorious for scheduling a few games a year versus cupcake opponents.

168
00:14:18,940 --> 00:14:24,300
University athletic departments have been known to pay six-figure sums for vastly inferior

169
00:14:24,300 --> 00:14:27,260
teams to come into town and get pummeled into the turf.

170
00:14:27,820 --> 00:14:31,340
It's a small price to pay for what should be an automatic victory.

171
00:14:31,900 --> 00:14:36,300
That's certainly what the 2007 Michigan Wolverines were thinking when they scheduled

172
00:14:36,300 --> 00:14:40,460
their opening day contest against the Appalachian State Mountaineers.

173
00:14:40,460 --> 00:14:45,100
Going into the season, Michigan was ranked as the fifth best team in the nation,

174
00:14:45,100 --> 00:14:48,300
and their opponents were quite literally out of their league.

175
00:14:48,300 --> 00:14:54,060
The Mountaineers were a Division I Double-A team, a complete tier beneath Michigan's pedigree.

176
00:14:54,060 --> 00:14:57,260
There would have been no shame if Appalachian State had simply

177
00:14:57,260 --> 00:14:59,580
laid down and accepted their beating.

178
00:14:59,580 --> 00:15:04,540
Unfortunately for Michigan, they were about to learn that there are no free wins in sports.

179
00:15:05,580 --> 00:15:06,860
And the kick is blocked!

180
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:12,940
Appalachian State has stunned the college football world,

181
00:15:12,940 --> 00:15:16,620
one of the greatest upsets in sports history.

182
00:15:17,420 --> 00:15:21,900
College sports provide ample opportunities for the classic Cinderella story,

183
00:15:21,980 --> 00:15:25,340
a term most frequently used during March Madness.

184
00:15:25,340 --> 00:15:32,060
In Division I basketball, the season champion is decided by a 64-team single-elimination tournament.

185
00:15:32,060 --> 00:15:35,820
The early rounds of the tournament are a breeding ground for memorable upsets,

186
00:15:35,820 --> 00:15:40,300
as the top teams in the country face off against others who are just happy to be there.

187
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:45,180
Every few years or so, a powerhouse team would get bounced from the tournament by

188
00:15:45,180 --> 00:15:47,260
some school you couldn't even find on a map.

189
00:15:47,820 --> 00:15:54,940
But after 33 years of the 64-team format, a 1-seed had never been defeated by a 16-seed.

190
00:15:54,940 --> 00:16:02,700
That was until 2018, when the 31-2 Virginia Cavaliers faced off against the UMBC Retrievers.

191
00:16:03,340 --> 00:16:08,060
In what may very well have been the most shocking upset in the history of college sports,

192
00:16:08,060 --> 00:16:11,900
Virginia didn't just lose, but got blown out by 20 points.

193
00:16:12,540 --> 00:16:14,780
College sports aren't for everyone,

194
00:16:14,780 --> 00:16:19,740
but you have to admit that they are capable of producing madness that you won't see anywhere else.

195
00:16:20,380 --> 00:16:23,980
However, the most enduring upsets are left to the professionals.

196
00:16:24,540 --> 00:16:30,940
The 2007 New England Patriots are considered by some to be the greatest NFL team ever assembled.

197
00:16:30,940 --> 00:16:36,780
They set all kinds of records and were on track for a perfect season to surpass the 72 Dolphins.

198
00:16:37,420 --> 00:16:42,940
After cruising to the Super Bowl, they faced off against the paltry New York Giants,

199
00:16:42,940 --> 00:16:45,260
a team that hadn't even won their division.

200
00:16:45,980 --> 00:16:51,420
After leading for most of the game, the Patriots were just two minutes away from capping off the

201
00:16:51,420 --> 00:16:58,860
greatest season in NFL history. But hey, those pesky Giants somehow, some way, could not be

202
00:16:58,860 --> 00:17:05,820
stopped. And the mighty Patriots had to settle for 18-1. Every year the Super Bowl is the most

203
00:17:05,820 --> 00:17:12,220
watched broadcast in America, but its viewership pales in comparison to the World Cup, which

204
00:17:12,220 --> 00:17:18,300
consistently attracts an audience of billions. The largest in-person audience for any World Cup

205
00:17:18,300 --> 00:17:25,100
game was estimated to be 220,000 for the 1950 final in Rio de Janeiro, an audience that would

206
00:17:25,100 --> 00:17:30,780
go on to witness one of the most brutal defeats in the history of sports. That year the Brazilian

207
00:17:30,780 --> 00:17:36,380
men's national team looked unstoppable. They had smoked their past two opponents by a combined

208
00:17:36,380 --> 00:17:43,420
score of 13-2 and had only Uruguay standing in the way of their first World Cup. The Brazilians

209
00:17:43,420 --> 00:17:48,460
were so confident in their victory that they had politicians delivering congratulatory speeches

210
00:17:48,460 --> 00:17:54,380
before the game even started. Due to the unusual round-robin format of that year's tournament,

211
00:17:54,380 --> 00:18:00,940
Brazil could draw the game and still win the cup. It seemed simple enough. You have all the momentum

212
00:18:00,940 --> 00:18:06,860
in the world. You are far and away the better team. All you have to do is not lose in your home

213
00:18:06,860 --> 00:18:16,460
stadium and you're the world champions. They lost 2-1. There's an argument to be made that out of

214
00:18:16,460 --> 00:18:23,180
every defeat in the history of sports, this was the single most agonizing. After the game, the

215
00:18:23,180 --> 00:18:29,820
200,000 Brazilians in attendance sat in absolute silence. They weren't just stunned, they were

216
00:18:29,820 --> 00:18:36,460
traumatized. It was reported that in the following moments, multiple fans leapt from the grandstands

217
00:18:36,460 --> 00:18:43,980
to their deaths. This may be hard to understand for non-sports viewers, but some people just really do

218
00:18:43,980 --> 00:18:50,940
care that much about the outcome of a game. As absurd as it may be to say, choking can literally

219
00:18:50,940 --> 00:18:57,100
be a matter of life and death. The biggest upset certainly live up to their name. They can be quite

220
00:18:57,100 --> 00:19:03,020
upsetting to watch. However, these moments don't place as highly on the scale of sorrow when you

221
00:19:03,020 --> 00:19:08,540
consider why they were called upsets in the first place. While the Davids of the sports world may

222
00:19:08,540 --> 00:19:14,460
eke out the occasional fluke win, there's a reason why the Goliaths have earned their title. Apart

223
00:19:14,460 --> 00:19:21,900
from the rare stumble, they tend to win. A lot. After losing to UMBC, Virginia would run it back

224
00:19:21,900 --> 00:19:27,260
and win the tournament the very next season. Mike Tyson would eventually reclaim his heavyweight

225
00:19:27,260 --> 00:19:33,980
title. The Patriots won three more Super Bowls and Brazil won five World Cups. It's safe to say

226
00:19:33,980 --> 00:19:39,660
that most of these guys ended up just fine. When we come back, we'll take a look at chokes so

227
00:19:39,660 --> 00:19:42,940
devastating that no one involved would ever really recover.

228
00:19:42,940 --> 00:19:52,140
Do you realize what could have happened if I hadn't sensed the pit in time?

229
00:19:52,780 --> 00:19:55,340
I suppose you could have choked.

230
00:20:00,460 --> 00:20:04,220
Well everyone, it's the worst time of the year. Football season.

231
00:20:04,780 --> 00:20:09,500
Boy, can't wait to watch the Jaguars suck it up for another four and a half months.

232
00:20:09,580 --> 00:20:15,100
But thankfully, rooting for a future team can suck just a little bit less with today's sponsor,

233
00:20:15,740 --> 00:20:21,100
Bespoke Post. A subscription service that ships out premium goods every month,

234
00:20:21,100 --> 00:20:26,940
or about twice as often as every Jaguars win. Bespoke offers a variety of products ranging

235
00:20:26,940 --> 00:20:33,260
from outdoor, home, cooking, and more. Just take the online quiz to find one that's right for you.

236
00:20:33,260 --> 00:20:39,180
By subscribing, Bespoke will send you a box with $70 worth of stuff for just a fraction of the cost.

237
00:20:39,580 --> 00:20:45,180
Which makes them a far better value than Jaguars tickets. Each month, you get a preview of what's

238
00:20:45,180 --> 00:20:50,060
inside. And unlike your abysmal hometown franchise, if you don't like the product,

239
00:20:50,060 --> 00:20:54,860
you can swap it out for something else or skip the month entirely for no charge.

240
00:20:54,860 --> 00:20:59,900
For football fans, I recommend Bespoke's parked camping chair for your tailgating needs.

241
00:20:59,900 --> 00:21:06,220
And for Jaguars fans specifically, I recommend one of Bespoke's many alcohol-related accessories.

242
00:21:06,220 --> 00:21:12,140
Because God knows you're gonna need it. And who could forget the classic weekender travel bag?

243
00:21:12,140 --> 00:21:17,820
Perfect for those days when you really need to cover up your shame. So get in the game. Visit

245
00:21:25,420 --> 00:21:31,260
I'm sure that just like Urban Meyer, you'll get a kick out of it. But hey, it's not all doom and

246
00:21:31,260 --> 00:21:36,540
gloom in Jacksonville. In fact, the Jags may have actually figured out the NFL's greatest

247
00:21:36,540 --> 00:21:41,260
new strategy. You can't choke if you're never winning in the first place.

248
00:21:49,340 --> 00:21:53,260
Many children around the world have dreams of becoming a star athlete.

249
00:21:53,900 --> 00:21:58,300
It's an all too common thought to envision yourself scoring the game-winning shot as the

250
00:21:58,300 --> 00:22:05,260
clock expires. What many of us fail to consider, however, is the opposite case. A handful of

251
00:22:05,260 --> 00:22:10,700
athletes do manage to beat the odds and make it to the biggest stage. But rather than having

252
00:22:10,700 --> 00:22:16,140
their dreams come true, they all of a sudden find themselves in the midst of a living nightmare.

253
00:22:20,700 --> 00:22:26,940
Chris Webber had a solid NBA career, but most people only remember him for one costly mistake

254
00:22:26,940 --> 00:22:40,060
that he made in college. Down by two in the final seconds of the championship game, Webber got

255
00:22:40,060 --> 00:22:45,740
caught in a bind and attempted to reset the situation by calling timeout. The only problem

256
00:22:45,740 --> 00:22:51,420
was that his team was out of timeouts, resulting in a technical foul that immediately ended their

257
00:22:51,420 --> 00:22:56,780
chances of victory. It seemed that no matter how much Chris Webber accomplished in the rest of his

258
00:22:56,780 --> 00:23:03,340
basketball career, he could never overcome the stigma of this one miscue. A similar fate would

259
00:23:03,340 --> 00:23:10,140
befall NFL tight end Jackie Smith. In the 1970s, he was one of the best players at his position.

260
00:23:10,140 --> 00:23:15,100
During the 78 season, he was called out of retirement to play for a Dallas Cowboys team

261
00:23:15,100 --> 00:23:21,420
with championship aspirations. That team did end up making it to the Super Bowl, and down by a

262
00:23:21,420 --> 00:23:27,900
score late, quarterback Roger Staubach targeted a wide open Smith in the end zone, who proceeded to

263
00:23:27,900 --> 00:23:39,100
drop the game-tying touchdown. Dallas was forced to settle for a field goal, and that four-point

264
00:23:39,100 --> 00:23:44,220
swing wound up being the difference in the game. Smith's pivotal blunder caused him to be

265
00:23:44,220 --> 00:23:50,140
single-handedly blamed for the defeat. Today, this lone moment is pretty much all he's known for.

266
00:23:50,940 --> 00:23:56,140
Across his Hall of Fame career, Jackie Smith caught 480 passes,

267
00:23:56,140 --> 00:23:59,900
but he is forever doomed to be remembered for the one he dropped.

268
00:24:03,100 --> 00:24:10,780
It can seem rather unjust how much one mistake can ruin someone's legacy. In the 1994 World Cup,

269
00:24:10,780 --> 00:24:16,620
Roberto Baggio was the breakout star of the whole tournament, helping to carry the Italians to the

270
00:24:16,620 --> 00:24:22,140
Finals. But after the game went to penalties when the team needed him most, he sailed his

271
00:24:22,140 --> 00:24:28,860
lone opportunity over the crossbar. The miss would haunt Baggio for years, who is remembered today as

272
00:24:28,860 --> 00:24:34,940
one of the best players to never win the World Cup. In association football, the striker is often the

273
00:24:34,940 --> 00:24:40,540
most revered position on the field. The same can't be said for their American counterparts.

274
00:24:41,180 --> 00:24:46,060
In the NFL, the kicker is one of the most thankless roles that anyone can fill.

275
00:24:46,140 --> 00:24:51,660
We're talking about our idiot kicker. Do your job well and no one bats an eye,

276
00:24:51,660 --> 00:24:56,060
but screw up just once and you will be ridiculed until the cows come home.

277
00:24:56,940 --> 00:25:02,940
In recent history, two of the cruelest misses that come to mind are Blair Walsh's chip-shot shank and

278
00:25:02,940 --> 00:25:08,460
Cody Parkey's double doink. However, the distinction for the costliest miss in NFL

279
00:25:08,460 --> 00:25:14,780
history has to go to one of two incidents from the 90s. Across more than a half century,

280
00:25:14,780 --> 00:25:20,140
four Super Bowls have been decided by a last-second field goal. Three were made,

281
00:25:20,140 --> 00:25:25,740
and one was missed. The dishonor belonged to Buffalo Bills kicker Scott Norwood,

282
00:25:25,740 --> 00:25:30,060
who missed wide right on a 47-yarder that would have won the Bills the title.

283
00:25:30,700 --> 00:25:35,740
It's a moment that has tragically become the most replayed missed field goal of all time.

284
00:25:36,460 --> 00:25:41,660
However, in defense of Norwood, the standard for kickers back then was much less efficient

285
00:25:41,660 --> 00:25:47,980
than what we see today. 47 yards was about at the limit of his range, so the attempt was certainly

286
00:25:47,980 --> 00:25:54,940
no gimme, especially considering the circumstances. For my money, the NFL's actual worst miss occurred

287
00:25:54,940 --> 00:26:02,060
eight years later in the 1998 NFC Championship game. Minnesota Vikings kicker Gary Anderson

288
00:26:02,060 --> 00:26:08,140
had not missed a kick all season, leading by a touchdown with two minutes left. All Anderson

289
00:26:08,140 --> 00:26:13,820
had to do was make one more to put the game out of reach. However, when staring down the most

290
00:26:13,820 --> 00:26:20,700
crucial kick of his life, Anderson could not deliver. And all of a sudden, his perfect season

291
00:26:20,700 --> 00:26:27,020
had turned into the perfect storm. It was just a matter of time before the Vikings' lead was gone,

292
00:26:27,020 --> 00:26:33,420
along with their championship hopes. It can often be difficult for sports fans to reconcile the

293
00:26:33,420 --> 00:26:39,500
complex list of reasons for why their team lost. It's usually far easier to pin the whole mess

294
00:26:39,500 --> 00:26:45,740
on one player and one moment, no matter how unreasonable it may be. This type of coping

295
00:26:45,740 --> 00:26:51,100
mechanism is otherwise known as scapegoating, and in the history of sports, there was perhaps

296
00:26:51,100 --> 00:26:55,340
no bigger scapegoat than Bill Buckner. The nightmares are that you're gonna

297
00:26:56,060 --> 00:26:59,980
let the winning run score on a ground ball through your legs.

298
00:27:03,500 --> 00:27:10,300
Late in Game 6 of the 1986 World Series, Boston Red Sox manager John McNamara made the faithful

299
00:27:10,300 --> 00:27:16,380
decision to leave Buckner in the game at first base. By this point, the 18-year veteran was

300
00:27:16,380 --> 00:27:21,900
well past his prime and would usually be subbed out for a more sure-handed defender in crucial

301
00:27:21,900 --> 00:27:27,740
situations. However, as the elder statesman of the team, Buckner was given the honors to

302
00:27:27,740 --> 00:27:33,500
close out what was anticipated to be a very special moment, leading the New York Mets 5-3

303
00:27:33,500 --> 00:27:38,060
in the bottom of the 10th. The Red Sox were just three outs away from winning their first

304
00:27:38,060 --> 00:27:44,380
championship in nearly 70 years. After retiring the first two batters, relief pitcher Calvin

305
00:27:44,380 --> 00:27:50,460
Schiraldi got into a jam, and the Mets would tie the game off a wild pitch with the bases loaded.

306
00:27:51,100 --> 00:27:56,460
The next batter, Mookie Wilson, appeared to end the inning by hitting a ground ball directly at

307
00:27:56,460 --> 00:28:03,420
Bill Buckner. It's the most routine defensive play in all of baseball, one so elementary that most

308
00:28:03,420 --> 00:28:09,420
children have no problem making it. Bill Buckner had probably done so a thousand times by that

309
00:28:09,420 --> 00:28:16,220
point in his career, but on this day, his glove is a bit loose, his ankles are a tad weak, and he's

310
00:28:16,220 --> 00:28:34,540
not quite the player he used to be. The Red Sox would go on to lose game seven, and the fury of

311
00:28:34,540 --> 00:28:40,220
a tortured fan base would be placed squarely on Bill Buckner's shoulders. The error had made him

312
00:28:40,220 --> 00:28:46,700
a national laughingstock and an absolute outcast in the city of Boston. Buckner had to endure so

313
00:28:46,700 --> 00:28:52,620
much hatred that he eventually had to move his family out to Idaho, where no one knew who he was.

314
00:28:53,420 --> 00:28:58,940
And with that, we've reached a point where chokes stop being so entertaining and stark being pretty

315
00:28:58,940 --> 00:29:05,100
hard to watch. To go back and revisit this footage over and over again, we are prying into what is

316
00:29:05,180 --> 00:29:10,940
quite literally the worst day of someone's life. A moment in which their destiny was profoundly

317
00:29:10,940 --> 00:29:17,020
and permanently altered for the worse. But what if that moment were dragged out just a little bit

318
00:29:17,020 --> 00:29:29,100
longer? For as bad as some of these disasters are, at the very least they come and go in an instant.

319
00:29:29,100 --> 00:29:32,940
The victims aren't given any time to marinate in their active suffering.

320
00:29:33,580 --> 00:29:39,660
Even more terrifying than a single nightmare moment is the meltdown, where an athlete's anguish

321
00:29:39,660 --> 00:29:46,380
is sustained over a much longer time frame. This is no longer your average everyday choking.

322
00:29:46,380 --> 00:29:53,100
This is advanced choking. Golf could be described as one of the loneliest sports of all.

323
00:29:53,740 --> 00:29:59,660
If you screw up, you have no one to blame but yourself. This psychological spell has set the

324
00:29:59,660 --> 00:30:06,140
stage for some of the most epic implosions that any competitors ever experienced. In the 1999

325
00:30:06,140 --> 00:30:11,580
British Open, Jean van de Velde is playing the tournament of his life. He entered the weekend

326
00:30:11,580 --> 00:30:17,420
ranked outside the top 100 players on tour and is now on the cusp of winning one of the sports

327
00:30:17,420 --> 00:30:25,100
crown jewel events. All he has to do is complete the final hole in six strokes. The following 14

328
00:30:25,100 --> 00:30:28,140
minutes can only be described as a real-life horror movie.

329
00:30:56,060 --> 00:31:00,060
I've never seen anything like it before, and to attempt to hit the ball out of there is pure

330
00:31:00,060 --> 00:31:06,700
madness. He's thinking about it, but this is horrendous stuff Alex. No, thank goodness.

331
00:31:13,900 --> 00:31:16,140
I just don't understand what on earth he was doing.

332
00:31:16,460 --> 00:31:21,180
Oh

333
00:31:32,460 --> 00:31:38,540
Van de Velde would eventually finish the 18th hole with a triple bogey seven and would go on to lose

334
00:31:38,540 --> 00:31:44,620
in a playoff. For the rest of his career, he would never even sniff another major tournament win.

335
00:31:45,420 --> 00:31:50,780
Golf may be considered the sport of gentleman, but there are times when it can be absolutely

336
00:31:50,780 --> 00:31:57,020
savage. Three years before Jean van de Velde's meltdown, Greg Norman succumbed to one that was

337
00:31:57,020 --> 00:32:04,620
even worse. If you thought one hole of misery was bad, you should see it prolonged over an entire

338
00:32:04,620 --> 00:32:10,700
round. Norman entered the final day of the 1996 Masters with a commanding six-stroke lead.

339
00:32:11,260 --> 00:32:16,620
Over the course of that Sunday afternoon, that lead would slowly and steadily evaporate into

340
00:32:16,620 --> 00:32:21,500
nothingness. It was like watching a wayward sailor drift at sea in a sinking ship.

341
00:32:22,220 --> 00:32:28,540
There was no saving him. In about three hours, Norman's six-stroke lead had disintegrated into

342
00:32:28,540 --> 00:32:35,900
a five-stroke deficit. By the end of it all, he wasn't even close to winning. One bad play can be

343
00:32:35,900 --> 00:32:41,900
written off as an outlier. Several in a row can be chalked up to some bad luck, but to suddenly

344
00:32:41,900 --> 00:32:47,820
lose your god-given abilities for an entire game, you just might have to start believing in curses.

345
00:32:48,780 --> 00:32:55,580
One fan base very familiar with curses is that of the Chicago Cubs, who by 2003 had experienced

346
00:32:55,580 --> 00:33:01,740
nearly a century of futility. In that season's NLCS, they finally looked on track to reverse

347
00:33:01,740 --> 00:33:07,660
their fortunes. After shutting out the Florida Marlins for the first seven innings of game six,

348
00:33:07,660 --> 00:33:12,780
the Cubs were just five outs away from a long-awaited return to the World Series.

349
00:33:12,780 --> 00:33:19,420
But after Cubs fan Steve Bartman crossed paths with a chance foul ball, it was as if fate itself

350
00:33:19,420 --> 00:33:25,100
had flipped a switch. The Cubs, who had controlled the entire game to that point, had just been

351
00:33:25,100 --> 00:33:27,100
transported to the inning from hell.

352
00:33:56,060 --> 00:34:03,420
Three runs are going to score on a double by Mordecai, and this crowd at Wrigley Field stunned

353
00:34:03,420 --> 00:34:10,860
in disbelief. Baseball is one of the only sports with no time limit, meaning that the potential for

354
00:34:10,860 --> 00:34:17,900
suffering is theoretically infinite. After watching their victory disappear before their eyes, Cubs

355
00:34:17,900 --> 00:34:23,420
fans must have been wondering if the tournament would ever end. It turned out that the old curse

356
00:34:23,420 --> 00:34:29,660
was there to stay for just a bit longer. At the turn of the 21st century, the only other baseball

357
00:34:29,660 --> 00:34:35,340
team as misfortunate as the Cubs were our old friends, the Red Sox. Not only did they have a

358
00:34:35,340 --> 00:34:40,620
generational championship drought of their own, they had to sit and watch as their bitter rivals

359
00:34:40,620 --> 00:34:46,220
became the most successful franchise in all of sports. Throughout the 20th century, the Red Sox

360
00:34:46,220 --> 00:34:52,700
had almost too many heartbreaks to count, with one of the absolute worst taking place in the 1978

361
00:34:52,700 --> 00:34:59,260
season. On the morning of July 20th, the Red Sox led the American League standings by a staggering

362
00:34:59,260 --> 00:35:06,460
14-game margin over the Yankees. By September, Boston's lead had dwindled to just four games,

363
00:35:06,460 --> 00:35:11,980
just as they were slated to face the Yankees in a four-game series. The Red Sox ended up getting

364
00:35:11,980 --> 00:35:18,460
swept so badly that the performance went on to be known as the Boston Massacre. Just like that, the

365
00:35:18,460 --> 00:35:24,940
14-game lead had vanished, and the Yankees had tied them in the standings. After squandering the

366
00:35:24,940 --> 00:35:30,540
entire advantage they once had, the Red Sox were given one last opportunity to right the ship,

367
00:35:31,100 --> 00:35:36,540
a regular season tiebreaker in their home stadium, with the winner advancing to the postseason.

368
00:35:37,180 --> 00:35:43,260
However, any chance of redemption would soon be foiled when Bucky Dent, a player who'd only hit

369
00:35:43,260 --> 00:35:48,540
four home runs that entire season, blasted a three-run shot that ended up winning the game

370
00:35:48,540 --> 00:35:55,340
for the Yankees. Boston was once again left in the dust and would have to watch their nemesis win yet

371
00:35:55,340 --> 00:36:02,700
another championship. Late season collapses are probably the most long-form meltdowns in all of

372
00:36:02,700 --> 00:36:09,100
sports, but in a season as long as baseball's, they're not unprecedented. If you want to know the

373
00:36:09,100 --> 00:36:14,540
absolute nastiest chokes that sports have to offer, you will find them in an exclusive

374
00:36:14,540 --> 00:36:25,980
collection of moments that were truly one of a kind. When it comes to ripping your heart out,

375
00:36:25,980 --> 00:36:32,860
these are the cream of the crop. At long last, we have arrived at the Chernobyl of sports disasters.

376
00:36:32,860 --> 00:36:39,660
A handful of events that, no matter how many times you watch, still seem inconceivable. We've

377
00:36:39,660 --> 00:36:45,740
talked about missed field goals before, but there's one particular miss that I've neglected to discuss

378
00:36:45,740 --> 00:36:53,740
until now. In the NFL, desperation plays are rarely ever successful, but in a 2003 game between the

379
00:36:53,740 --> 00:36:59,980
Saints and Jaguars, New Orleans scored one of the only multilateral touchdowns of the 21st century.

380
00:37:00,700 --> 00:37:06,060
Now, the uninitiated out there may think that we have finally uncovered the elusive Jacksonville

381
00:37:06,060 --> 00:37:16,460
Jaguars choke, but rest assured, the real choke was yet to come. He missed the extra point wide

382
00:37:16,460 --> 00:37:23,100
right. After one of the most sensational plays in recent memory, Saints kicker John Carney missed

383
00:37:23,100 --> 00:37:30,540
the extra point, a kick which at the time had almost a 99% success rate. The River City Relay

384
00:37:30,540 --> 00:37:36,140
would ultimately be in vain, and like most things in Jacksonville, would be pretty much forgotten.

385
00:37:36,780 --> 00:37:41,660
Believe it or not though, there are still more painful ways to lose a football game.

386
00:37:41,660 --> 00:37:48,140
To find out how, we have to once again visit our favorite college chokers, the Michigan Wolverines,

387
00:37:48,140 --> 00:37:52,540
whose football program never really recovered from the loss to Appalachian State.

388
00:37:53,180 --> 00:37:59,260
In 2015, Michigan looked to turn things around by hiring former NFL head coach Jim Harbaugh.

389
00:37:59,820 --> 00:38:06,060
Suffice to say, his tenure thus far hasn't quite lived up to expectations. We could have seen it

390
00:38:06,060 --> 00:38:12,380
coming had we paid attention to a particular omen from his first season in charge. With just 10

391
00:38:12,380 --> 00:38:18,140
seconds left, the Wolverines have a two-point lead against rival Michigan State. All they have

392
00:38:18,140 --> 00:38:35,340
to do to win is run one successful punt. And well, I think this guy's expression says it all.

393
00:38:36,300 --> 00:38:42,140
But for as frustrating as this was to watch, there is still one loss in the history of American

394
00:38:42,140 --> 00:38:50,620
football that is even more inexcusable. On November 19, 1978, the New York Giants

395
00:38:50,620 --> 00:38:57,580
are leading the Philadelphia Eagles 17-12 with just 30 seconds to play. The Giants have the ball,

396
00:38:57,580 --> 00:39:03,900
and the Eagles have no timeouts. Theoretically, losing from this position should be impossible.

397
00:39:03,900 --> 00:39:10,140
But for some godforsaken reason, the Giants are going to find a way to do so. Funnily enough,

398
00:39:10,140 --> 00:39:15,500
their demise would come almost entirely from the NFL's weird problem with kneeling,

399
00:39:15,500 --> 00:39:21,340
and not the kind you're probably thinking of. In the modern-day game, it is customary for teams

400
00:39:21,340 --> 00:39:26,940
to close out their final possession in victory formation, where the quarterback simply touches

401
00:39:26,940 --> 00:39:32,620
his knee to the ground and runs out the rest of the clock. But back in the day, many people in

402
00:39:32,620 --> 00:39:39,100
the league took issue to intentionally downing the ball, going so far as to call it unsportsmanlike.

403
00:39:39,100 --> 00:39:43,980
Because of this, the foolproof strategy was sometimes disregarded in favor of a more

404
00:39:43,980 --> 00:39:50,140
conventional play. All quarterback Joe Pisserchik had to do was drop to the ground and the Giants

405
00:39:50,140 --> 00:39:56,380
were home free. However, offensive coordinator Bob Gibson insisted on running a handoff.

406
00:39:56,940 --> 00:40:02,940
When the play call came in, the Giants players were in disbelief, with running back Larry Zonka

407
00:40:02,940 --> 00:40:08,540
outright refusing to take the ball. But after Gibson threatened to cut Pisserchik if he

408
00:40:08,540 --> 00:40:15,420
disobeyed the order, the play went on as planned. And well, there's a reason why every team today

409
00:40:15,420 --> 00:40:27,260
just takes a knee. The Eagles scored the game-winning touchdown from a fumble that

410
00:40:27,260 --> 00:40:33,020
shouldn't even have been a possibility. Giants fans were so irate that many ended up throwing

411
00:40:33,020 --> 00:40:39,580
the next game's tickets into a bonfire. Bob Gibson was axed the next morning and was never hired to

412
00:40:39,580 --> 00:40:45,180
coach at any level of football ever again. Perhaps the most fitting thing of all was the player who

413
00:40:45,180 --> 00:40:50,700
scored that touchdown. Most of you watching may not recognize him, but if you've been following

414
00:40:50,700 --> 00:40:57,260
along, this is someone we've already met long ago. And his wisdom rang just as true all the way

415
00:40:57,260 --> 00:41:05,340
back then. Players and coaches that get labeled as chokers don't tend to stick around for very long,

416
00:41:05,340 --> 00:41:11,020
but ever so often you'll find one that does. An exceptional talent who can just never have things

417
00:41:11,020 --> 00:41:16,780
work out for them in the end. This type of competitor is otherwise known as a choke artist,

418
00:41:16,780 --> 00:41:24,060
the most notable of which has to be NBA point guard Chris Paul. In 14 playoff appearances,

419
00:41:24,060 --> 00:41:31,980
Paul has managed to blow a 3-2 lead, a 3-1 lead, and a jaw-dropping 5-2-0 leads. No matter which

420
00:41:31,980 --> 00:41:38,220
team he plays for, postseason success is always just out of reach. One of those teams was the

421
00:41:38,220 --> 00:41:43,900
2018 Houston Rockets, who finished the regular season at the top of the Western Conference

422
00:41:43,900 --> 00:41:49,900
standings ahead of the formidable Golden State Warriors. The Warriors had taken the league by

423
00:41:49,900 --> 00:41:55,340
storm after becoming extremely efficient at shooting three-pointers. Rockets general manager

424
00:41:55,340 --> 00:42:00,060
Daryl Morey could see the tide turning and constructed a roster designed to beat the

425
00:42:00,060 --> 00:42:05,900
Warriors at their own game. The two teams were on a collision course that would ultimately be decided

426
00:42:05,900 --> 00:42:11,820
in game seven of the conference finals. Leading by 12 in the second quarter, the Rockets would

427
00:42:11,820 --> 00:42:18,060
enter the most unholy stretch of basketball that any team has ever witnessed. In the next 23

428
00:42:18,060 --> 00:42:25,180
minutes of game time, the Rockets missed 27 threes in a row. That year, the Rockets were having the

429
00:42:25,180 --> 00:42:30,700
most productive three-point shooting season in history. They had made over 36 percent of their

430
00:42:30,700 --> 00:42:38,940
attempts. The odds of this team missing 27 in a row was about 1 in 186,000. And for it to happen

431
00:42:38,940 --> 00:42:45,500
at the absolute worst possible time, that's a level of cruelty I cannot even begin to describe.

432
00:42:46,220 --> 00:42:51,900
It's one thing to cost yourself the game off some incompetent mistake, but at least in that

433
00:42:51,900 --> 00:42:57,820
case you get to blame it on something. What's truly demoralizing is being defeated by nothing

434
00:42:57,820 --> 00:43:04,940
more than the cold indifference of chance. If you think that 1 in 186,000 are rough odds,

435
00:43:04,940 --> 00:43:09,500
they don't even come close to the level of misfortune that Toronto Blue Jays pitcher Dave

436
00:43:09,500 --> 00:43:16,060
Steeve experienced in September of 1988. One of the greatest achievements for any pitcher is the

437
00:43:16,060 --> 00:43:23,740
no-hitter. In the 150-year history of the majors, only 317 have ever been thrown. At the end of the

438
00:43:23,740 --> 00:43:30,140
88 season, Dave Steeve had two consecutive no-hitters blown up on the last possible out.

439
00:43:30,700 --> 00:43:36,940
Sports writer John Boyce estimated that the chance of this happening was 1 in 241 million,

440
00:43:37,580 --> 00:43:43,020
but that still may not be as unlikely as what happened in the world of motorsports on May 29,

441
00:43:43,020 --> 00:43:49,980
2011. Many consider the last Sunday in May to be the greatest day in racing. In the United States,

442
00:43:49,980 --> 00:43:57,260
it features two long-standing traditions, starting at noon with the Indy 500, whose 2011 running saw

443
00:43:57,260 --> 00:44:04,060
rookie J.R. Hildebrand one lap away from victory. In the final corner, he misjudged a pass on a

444
00:44:04,060 --> 00:44:10,380
lapped car and crashed, allowing second-place Dan Weldon to steal the win on the final straightaway.

445
00:44:10,380 --> 00:44:16,380
The sponsor of Hildebrand's car was the National Guard, who just so happened to be sponsoring Dale

446
00:44:16,380 --> 00:44:22,540
Earnhardt Jr.'s car in the Coke 600 that evening. As Earnhardt found himself leading on the final

447
00:44:22,540 --> 00:44:38,460
lap, the National Guard car would experience deja vu. In an astounding coincidence, two separate

448
00:44:38,460 --> 00:44:43,740
drivers with the same sponsor would lose their respective races in the final turn of the final

449
00:44:43,740 --> 00:44:53,740
lap. A remarkable case of synchronized choking. Can choking really manifest itself on a macroscopic

450
00:44:53,740 --> 00:44:59,740
level? If so, the best evidence of it happening would have to be the wildest time in the history

451
00:44:59,740 --> 00:45:07,820
of American sports, 2016, otherwise known as the year of the choke. It started in the NBA Western

452
00:45:07,820 --> 00:45:14,700
Conference Finals, where the Oklahoma City Thunder blew a 3-1 series lead to the Golden State Warriors.

453
00:45:14,700 --> 00:45:19,900
After advancing to the finals, the Warriors proceeded to blow a 3-1 lead against the Cleveland

454
00:45:19,900 --> 00:45:26,140
Cavaliers. Five months later in the World Series, the Cleveland Indians blew a 3-1 lead to the

455
00:45:26,140 --> 00:45:33,500
Chicago Cubs, who finally ended their century-long championship drought. Two championship collapses in

456
00:45:33,500 --> 00:45:40,140
the same sports season was almost unprecedented, but the worst was still yet to come. Three months

457
00:45:40,140 --> 00:45:46,380
after the World Series, the Atlanta Falcons orchestrated the worst choke in Super Bowl history,

458
00:45:46,380 --> 00:45:53,180
blowing a 28-3 lead to the New England Patriots. In a span of just eight months, all three major

459
00:45:53,180 --> 00:45:59,420
American sports saw their champions crown through the ashes of historic chokes, a feat that will

460
00:45:59,420 --> 00:46:05,660
probably never happen again. Of course, I would be remiss if I didn't mention a certain other

461
00:46:05,660 --> 00:46:11,180
choke that happened in the United States at around the same time, in what has very much become our

462
00:46:11,180 --> 00:46:17,980
country's new most popular sport. But out of the prior three, the Falcons choke has to be the most

463
00:46:17,980 --> 00:46:24,700
iconic. However, I personally consider the Warriors choke to be the most historically fascinating.

464
00:46:24,700 --> 00:46:30,780
That season, the Warriors broke a record that few thought was possible. Their 73 regular season

465
00:46:30,780 --> 00:46:36,460
wins were the most in NBA history, and we would probably look back on them as the greatest team

466
00:46:36,460 --> 00:46:42,300
ever if they hadn't choked in the finals. Their defeat completed one of the strangest statistical

467
00:46:42,300 --> 00:46:49,180
oddities in all of sports. Combined with the 96 Red Wings, the 01 Mariners, and the 07 Patriots,

468
00:46:49,180 --> 00:46:54,460
the best regular season team from each of the big four U.S. sports leagues has failed to win

469
00:46:54,460 --> 00:47:01,180
the championship. The Warriors have had no shortage of winning since, but that missing ring still looms

470
00:47:01,180 --> 00:47:08,860
as a big blemish on an otherwise dominant dynasty. In sports, blowing a 3-1 lead is pretty uncommon.

471
00:47:08,860 --> 00:47:15,500
Blowing an 8-1 lead sounds almost unfathomable. The competitive yacht racing championship features

472
00:47:15,500 --> 00:47:23,500
a best-of-17 series. And in the 2013 running, Team New Zealand led Team USA eight races to one.

473
00:47:24,220 --> 00:47:29,580
Needing only a single victory in the next eight to clinch the title, New Zealand would go on to

474
00:47:29,580 --> 00:47:35,820
lose each and every one. In terms of sheer magnitude, no other choke in sports even comes

475
00:47:35,820 --> 00:47:41,980
close. But if you're asking me about the absolute greatest choke of all time, there is one other

476
00:47:41,980 --> 00:47:48,780
that tops it. While an 8-1 choke is truly mind-blowing, I still prefer the simple elegance of

477
00:47:48,780 --> 00:47:55,980
the 3-0 choke, the fabled reverse sweep. Everyone knows baseball as one of those sports that's so old.

478
00:47:55,980 --> 00:48:02,620
Pretty much any feat you can imagine has already been done long ago. But as of the 2004 season,

479
00:48:02,620 --> 00:48:09,980
no team had ever come back from a three games to none series deficit. 2004 marked year 86 of

480
00:48:09,980 --> 00:48:15,900
misery for the Boston Red Sox, who looked to once again have their hopes and dreams shattered by the

481
00:48:15,900 --> 00:48:21,420
New York Yankees. There had been Red Sox fans who lived and died without ever once seeing their

482
00:48:21,420 --> 00:48:28,140
beloved team win it all. All they had ever known was non-stop heartbreak, countless opportunities

483
00:48:28,140 --> 00:48:34,860
utterly wasted. By this point, the outcome seemed like a foregone conclusion. The Red Sox are getting

484
00:48:34,860 --> 00:48:40,940
crushed again. Their last sliver of hope relies on doing something that had never been done before

485
00:48:40,940 --> 00:48:48,060
in the history of their sport. It all comes down to this, the Boston Red Sox versus the rest of time.

486
00:48:55,100 --> 00:49:00,940
You know thus far I've only really shown chokes in a negative light. I've described them as brutal,

487
00:49:00,940 --> 00:49:06,700
cruel, and agonizing. But very rarely you'll encounter those ethereal moments when a choke is

488
00:49:06,700 --> 00:49:11,900
actually quite beautiful, where all the broken pieces just managed to fit together in the most

489
00:49:11,900 --> 00:49:18,860
perfect way. It's like poetry in motion, a surreal window into someplace else where great things

490
00:49:18,860 --> 00:49:26,140
really can happen. The truth is that outside of the sports world, most of us are losers. It can seem

491
00:49:26,140 --> 00:49:33,020
like whatever success we do find always manages to slip away. In a society that seems to value

492
00:49:33,020 --> 00:49:39,900
winning above all else, it's a tough pill to swallow. Losing is as undesirable as it is universal.

493
00:49:40,620 --> 00:49:46,540
It's hard to find a feeling more relatable. No matter how good you are, everyone has to

494
00:49:46,540 --> 00:49:51,980
lose eventually. In sports, it's easy to get caught up in the ruthless pursuit of glory.

495
00:49:52,620 --> 00:49:58,780
At times it can feel downright nihilistic. Perhaps the reason we find chokes so compelling is that

496
00:49:58,780 --> 00:50:04,140
they're the closest winners and losers ever get to each other. They remind us that not even the

497
00:50:04,140 --> 00:50:10,220
greatest winners can outrun the inevitability of defeat. It's the reason we watch and the reason

498
00:50:10,220 --> 00:50:16,780
we play. If the woeful Red Sox could come back against the mighty Yankees, who knows what else

499
00:50:16,780 --> 00:50:21,500
is possible.

500
00:50:21,500 --> 00:50:48,220
The Yankees, who are the storied franchise as we all know, are now at a dark hour because they just

501
00:50:48,220 --> 00:50:56,060
took the worst defeat not only in my lifetime as a Yankee fan, I think without question the worst

502
00:50:56,060 --> 00:51:03,820
defeat in their history. Now whenever you see a team go down 3-0 in any sport, they will put up

503
00:51:03,820 --> 00:51:11,420
a graphic on television which will say 2004 Red Sox down 3-0 beat New York Yankees. This is now

504
00:51:11,420 --> 00:51:16,540
part of sports history and every guy who's got a team down when it's back to the walls is going

505
00:51:16,540 --> 00:51:22,620
to talk about the Red Sox for the next 30 years.
