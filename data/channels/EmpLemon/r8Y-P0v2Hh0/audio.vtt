00:00.000 --> 00:08.080
It's morning again in America. Today, more men and women will go to work than ever before

00:08.080 --> 00:15.400
in our country's history. With interest rates at about half the record highs of 1980, nearly

00:15.400 --> 00:23.200
2,000 families today will buy a new home.

00:23.200 --> 00:27.800
Yep, that's us. You're probably wondering how we ended up in this situation. How did

00:27.800 --> 00:33.120
he do it? How did Donald Trump win the presidential election? It's been one whole year since he

00:33.120 --> 00:37.440
did it, and it still doesn't even feel real. I mean, you're telling me the guy who shaved

00:37.440 --> 00:41.480
Vince McMahon's head and got stunnered by Stone Cold Steve Austin at WrestleMania just

00:41.480 --> 00:46.560
a decade ago is now the elected leader of the most powerful nation on Earth? Now, there

00:46.560 --> 00:51.440
are lots of theories out there trying to explain how Trump won. Theories about Russians, collusion,

00:51.440 --> 00:57.780
neo-fascism, populism, Democratic Party incompetence, exploitation of an antiquated electoral system.

00:57.780 --> 01:01.720
But I'm not going to talk about any of that. Now, before I get into the video, I've got

01:01.720 --> 01:07.040
to give you guys full disclosure. This is not a political video. This is simply a video

01:07.040 --> 01:11.720
analyzing and discussing one man's rise to political power. I understand that the man

01:11.720 --> 01:16.640
I'm discussing is perhaps the most controversial figure of the 21st century so far, but I don't

01:16.640 --> 01:20.360
really give a shit. So you can go ahead and scorch that comment section all you want about

01:20.360 --> 01:24.840
political arguments. You'll just be wasting your time, because this is not a video about

01:24.840 --> 01:31.840
politics. This is a video about memes. This is a video about MEME THEORY.

01:44.480 --> 01:48.500
So at this point a lot of you are probably expecting a video discussing how meme magic,

01:48.500 --> 01:53.400
the cult of Keck, 4chan, and the formation of the alt-right caused Trump to become president.

01:53.400 --> 01:57.240
Now that's not what this video is about either. I really hate to say it, but Pepe didn't cause

01:57.240 --> 02:01.760
Trump to win the election. 4chan didn't cause Trump to win the election. I know it makes

02:01.760 --> 02:05.960
a really fun narrative to pretend that's what happened, but it's just too far-fetched. The

02:05.960 --> 02:11.080
reality is that 4chan is not single-handedly powerful enough to swing an election. Poll

02:11.080 --> 02:15.880
is the driving force behind 4chan's political aura. The board averaged a population of around

02:15.880 --> 02:21.240
130,000 users in the months preceding the election. Now assuming all of those users

02:21.240 --> 02:25.720
are of voting age, and all of those users voted for Trump, which are two pretty lofty

02:25.720 --> 02:31.640
assumptions, that's 130,000 votes on Trump's side. So how do you account for the other

02:31.640 --> 02:36.680
62 and a half million? I mean obviously it's absurd to think that spamming pictures of

02:36.680 --> 02:41.220
frogs can impact a presidential election. Memes are just silly pictures on the internet

02:41.220 --> 02:45.920
after all, and there's no way that something as insignificant as memes can have that much

02:45.920 --> 02:49.200
influence.

02:50.200 --> 02:52.200
Or can they?

03:01.200 --> 03:04.800
You see, when most people think about memes, they think of only just that, silly pictures

03:04.800 --> 03:10.280
on the internet. That's not exactly true. The definition of meme extends much further

03:10.280 --> 03:15.080
than what most people think. The word meme was first coined by Richard Dawkins as a combination

03:15.080 --> 03:19.400
of the English word gene and the Greek word mimea. Essentially a meme is just an element

03:19.400 --> 03:23.480
of human culture that gets reproduced by people sharing it. It's a misconception that memes

03:23.480 --> 03:27.880
have to come from the internet, or that they have to be image templates. Memes can be anything

03:27.880 --> 03:32.760
and they can come from anywhere. Memes can be words, spoken or printed. They can be events,

03:32.760 --> 03:39.120
people, faces, characters, both fictional and real. So if memes can be basically anything,

03:39.120 --> 03:43.720
what's stopping just anything, say a piece of lettuce with a pencil stuck through it,

03:43.760 --> 03:49.000
from becoming a meme? Well, that's where you come in. People decide, and they do it subconsciously.

03:49.000 --> 03:53.400
The most important determining factors in separating memes from ordinary things are

03:53.400 --> 03:55.400
exposure and repetition.

04:01.400 --> 04:06.040
Anything has the potential to become a meme. This is evident in the extreme variety of

04:06.040 --> 04:10.800
memes today. The big meme of the week is seemingly random. However, one of the easiest ways to

04:10.800 --> 04:16.280
understand why memes become popular is to quantify their prior exposure and repetition

04:16.280 --> 04:21.800
through mass media. There's a psychological phenomenon known as the mirror exposure effect,

04:21.800 --> 04:26.280
where people develop preferences for familiar things. Basically, if you repeat something

04:26.280 --> 04:31.320
enough, people will like it. This single principle is what allows brands, icons and memes to

04:31.320 --> 04:36.960
become so widespread. Memes are simply conceptual viruses. Most memes just lay dormant in the

04:36.960 --> 04:41.040
back of people's minds before becoming popular. Maybe it's a cheesy earworm from

04:41.040 --> 04:45.560
a popular song. Maybe it's a zany one-liner from a sitcom. Maybe it's a dumb character

04:45.560 --> 04:51.120
from a childhood cartoon. Like a virus, a meme spreads further if many people become

04:51.120 --> 04:56.920
exposed to it early on. Soon after, a random event triggers the meme to spread. Suddenly,

04:56.920 --> 05:00.840
everyone around you is talking about this meme. You see it show up more and more until

05:00.840 --> 05:05.240
finally you're using it yourself. You have been infected through repetition, and now

05:05.240 --> 05:10.280
you will inevitably infect others. Memes do not spread on their own. They cannot spread

05:10.280 --> 05:15.720
on their own. And just as a biological virus is powerless without a host, memes are powerless

05:15.720 --> 05:20.600
without their host, which happens to be the human brain. Once again, psychology is at

05:20.600 --> 05:25.680
work here. The reason memes exist, spread and influence our culture is that we enjoy

05:25.680 --> 05:31.040
them on a psychological level. Memes are exceptionally appealing to us because of how our brains

05:31.040 --> 05:35.640
understand. Schemas, heuristics, and chunking are all major psychological concepts dictating

05:35.640 --> 05:40.600
that human thought is heavily operated upon the representation of raw information through

05:40.600 --> 05:46.440
small manageable pieces. We understand concepts better by packaging them into familiar bits.

05:46.440 --> 05:50.480
Our brains do this automatically in order to efficiently store information. Memes are

05:50.480 --> 05:56.080
socially generated concepts that reflect our psychological methods for information processing.

05:56.080 --> 06:01.200
Through a meme, it is possible to compress a complex issue, narrative, or emotion into

06:01.200 --> 06:07.080
a single image or phrase. Simply put, a meme is the fastest way to put an idea in someone's

06:07.080 --> 06:11.500
head. So now that we've defined memes and how they work, let's go back to the main question

06:11.500 --> 06:17.160
of this video. How did Trump use them to become president? In order to answer that, we must

06:17.160 --> 06:21.400
first consider how anyone becomes president. In order to become president, one must first

06:21.400 --> 06:25.440
meet the minimum constitutional requirements in addition to becoming an expert on both

06:25.440 --> 06:30.440
international and domestic politics, law, history, and debate. It is paramount that

06:30.440 --> 06:35.360
an aspiring president first spends decades serving in public office or the military slowly

06:35.360 --> 06:39.480
building their reputation, credibility, and experience all while working their way up

06:39.480 --> 06:44.040
the ranks until they're either a US senator, state governor, or military general. It is

06:44.040 --> 06:48.680
only at this point when an American politician can even attempt a presidential campaign and

06:48.680 --> 06:52.840
gain any sort of traction whatsoever. From this point, they must engage in up to 18 months

06:52.840 --> 06:58.560
of arduous strategizing, traveling, fundraising, marketing, and debating in order to persuade

06:58.560 --> 07:03.280
enough people to vote for them to become the nominee of one of the two major American political

07:03.280 --> 07:07.400
parties. And at this point, you just have to hope and pray that half of the voters like

07:07.400 --> 07:12.480
you more than the other guy. And finally, after all that struggle, you can become president

07:12.480 --> 07:21.280
of the United States. Going into 2015, Trump met the bare constitutional requirements.

07:21.600 --> 07:25.360
Maybe we're gonna have to approach this from a different angle. So fuck all this dumb shit

07:25.360 --> 07:30.640
for nerds, how does anyone really become president? Well, in order to achieve the most powerful

07:30.640 --> 07:36.080
position of political power in the world, with no prior political experience, we have

07:36.080 --> 07:41.720
to approach the challenge from a top-down perspective. If you've ever gone to school,

07:41.720 --> 07:47.960
you're probably familiar with the multiple choice test. Now normally, you gotta study

07:47.960 --> 07:51.920
all the material on the test in order to answer the test questions and bubble in the

07:51.920 --> 07:56.400
correct answer choice. But technically, the first two steps aren't necessary in order

07:56.400 --> 08:00.600
to get a good grade. For a multiple choice test, passing the test only really requires

08:00.600 --> 08:05.360
you to bubble in the correct sequence of letters in order. And for this reason, it's possible

08:05.360 --> 08:10.960
to average a 25% on a multiple choice test, even if you know 0% of the information. Just

08:10.960 --> 08:15.760
choose A every time, and 1 out of 4 of your answers will be correct. For a true or false

08:15.760 --> 08:19.360
test, the odds are even more in your favor. By choosing A every time, you'll average

08:19.360 --> 08:24.740
a 50% despite knowing 0% of the information being tested. Now obviously, schools are caught

08:24.740 --> 08:29.880
on to this, which is why 50% is still an F. However, in a two-party electoral system,

08:29.880 --> 08:35.520
50% is usually enough to win you an election. So let's apply this logic to a presidential

08:35.520 --> 08:40.480
election. In order to become president, you need to follow these steps. Step 1, become

08:40.480 --> 08:44.720
easily recognized by the public. You have a much better chance of winning if a bunch

08:44.720 --> 08:50.200
of people already know who you are. Since 1980, almost all presidential elections have

08:50.200 --> 08:55.320
been won by a candidate that was already well known by the American public. Step 2, run

08:55.320 --> 09:00.880
as a Democrat or a Republican. Democrats and Republicans have won every single presidential

09:00.880 --> 09:05.760
election since the Civil War. In order to become president, you must become the nominee

09:05.760 --> 09:11.960
for one of these parties. Step 3, have about 50% of the voters vote for you. Partisan politics

09:11.960 --> 09:16.440
have become an epidemic. You could host the most clumsy and awkward campaign ever, and

09:16.440 --> 09:20.560
about half the voters will still vote for you because you have a D or an R next to your

09:20.560 --> 09:25.200
name. Weak candidates can use this to their advantage. Since 1980, the winning president

09:25.200 --> 09:29.880
has almost always won with close to 50% of the popular vote. Sometimes they won with

09:29.880 --> 09:34.840
less than 50%. And in order for a long shot like Trump to have any chance of becoming

09:34.840 --> 09:39.840
president, he was going to have to rely on all of these steps. And he did it using memes.

09:41.960 --> 09:51.280
Donald Trump started out as just another wealthy New York City businessman. So what

09:51.280 --> 09:55.760
made him different? Well, Trump just really liked to put his name on stuff. I mean, he

09:55.760 --> 09:59.760
really liked to put his name on stuff. Trump made it clear from early on that his strategy

09:59.760 --> 10:05.160
as a businessman was not to build luxury apartments, but to build himself into a brand. There actually

10:05.160 --> 10:09.840
isn't that much separating a brand from a meme. They're functionally identical. Both

10:09.840 --> 10:14.960
condensed big concepts into a single name or image. Brands are basically just corporate

10:14.960 --> 10:19.660
memes. And it just so happens that Trump was in the perfect position to become a living

10:19.660 --> 10:24.440
meme. Trump is a verb meaning to defeat by doing better. Coincidentally, Trump's own

10:24.440 --> 10:29.680
name succinctly represented the power, prestige, and dominance associated with a wealthy New

10:29.680 --> 10:35.000
York businessman. In 1978, Trump commenced the construction of Trump Tower, a 58-story

10:35.000 --> 10:39.800
luxury skyscraper in Manhattan. The location of Manhattan is important because Manhattan

10:39.800 --> 10:44.640
is the financial and cultural center of New York City, the biggest city in North America.

10:44.640 --> 10:48.640
Manhattan is home to globally renowned landmarks, Times Square, the Empire State Building, the

10:48.640 --> 10:53.440
World Trade Centers, and now Trump Tower. Trump put his name on one of the biggest landmarks

10:53.440 --> 11:02.920
in the heart of New York City, leaving millions to wonder, who is this Trump fellow? In order

11:02.920 --> 11:07.760
for a meme to spread, it must first have a means of spreading. Today, basically every

11:07.760 --> 11:11.720
meme gets spread through the internet. Everyone in our society is connected to the internet,

11:11.720 --> 11:16.600
which makes it the fastest way for ideas and memes to spread. In the 1980s, mass media

11:16.600 --> 11:20.520
was very different. Instead of the internet, almost all Americans got their information

11:20.520 --> 11:26.760
through network television. NBC, CBS, and ABC. And it just so happens that all three

11:26.760 --> 11:31.560
of the major networks had headquarters located in Manhattan, just a few miles away from Trump

11:31.560 --> 11:36.000
Tower. New York City was the center of mass media in the United States, and it would be

11:36.000 --> 11:40.600
this media that would transform Trump from businessman to celebrity. Donald Trump, as

11:40.600 --> 11:46.640
I say, is just 33 years old. He now has an apartment for sale in a new Trump building

11:46.640 --> 11:51.160
called the Trump Tower. Starting around 1980, Donald Trump began to make appearances on

11:51.160 --> 11:57.600
national television. First it was just a few interviews. Then it was cameos. Donald Trump.

11:58.360 --> 12:04.280
Ads. Entire television programs centered around Donald Trump. From the perspective of the networks, they were just

12:04.280 --> 12:09.560
exploiting an easily available resource. Donald Trump was inherently interesting to the American

12:09.560 --> 12:14.480
public. Look at this right here on the street! It's Donald Trump! What are you, morons?

12:14.480 --> 12:19.200
While most billionaire business tycoons try to avoid the spotlight, Trump reveled in it.

12:19.200 --> 12:23.440
Americans just kept seeing this bold, confident man on their television sets over and over

12:23.440 --> 12:28.480
again. The focus wasn't on who he was, but what he represented. You didn't have to know

12:28.480 --> 12:33.760
anything about Trump to recognize that he was rich, tough, and successful, just by the

12:33.760 --> 12:38.240
way he acted on television. Trump embodied the spirit of capitalism that was rampant

12:38.240 --> 12:44.040
in the 80s, and many Americans admired and idolized him as a symbol of wealth and power.

12:44.040 --> 12:48.480
Trump stayed consistently relevant in the American public for 20 years after that. He

12:48.480 --> 12:51.840
had truly become one of the most recognized men in America.

13:18.480 --> 13:20.480
You know, that's his appeal to me.

13:48.480 --> 13:56.480
Uh-oh! You frickin' moron! You just got di-

14:18.480 --> 14:35.600
So by now in our story, Trump had completed the first step in becoming president, becoming well

14:35.600 --> 14:40.840
recognized by the general public. Now he was ready to actually run for president, which he had to do

14:40.840 --> 14:45.960
as either a Democrat or a Republican in order to have any chance of winning. But which party would

14:45.960 --> 14:49.800
give him the best chance of winning? Trump's party affiliation history is actually quite

14:49.800 --> 14:54.080
interesting, and few people are aware of it. Starting in the 80s, Trump was actually regarded

14:54.080 --> 14:58.840
as a Democrat. In 1987, he registered as a Republican and remained that way for about a

14:58.840 --> 15:04.520
decade. Then in 1999, he joined the Independent Reform Party, where he tried to run for president.

15:04.520 --> 15:09.560
That's right, Trump actually launched an exploratory campaign for the 2000 presidential election,

15:09.560 --> 15:14.720
17 years before he became the most controversial political figure in the country. He ended up

15:14.720 --> 15:18.760
dropping out before the primaries due to party infighting, but it's interesting nonetheless.

15:18.760 --> 15:24.240
Then starting in 2001, he was a Democrat again. You identify more as a Democrat or a Republican?

15:24.240 --> 15:30.320
Well, you'd be shocked if I said that in many cases I probably identify more as a Democrat.

15:30.320 --> 15:36.160
Until 2009, when he registered as a Republican again. Now, an average observer would look at

15:36.160 --> 15:40.440
this data and call Trump a flip-clopper, a figurehead that can't make up his mind on

15:40.440 --> 15:45.680
issues. But that's not how I see it. Something's up here, and it becomes apparent when you compare

15:45.680 --> 15:50.400
Trump's party affiliation to the president's party through time. Trump's party position has

15:50.400 --> 15:54.560
almost always been contrarian to the acting president, and I believe that this was an

15:54.560 --> 15:59.520
intentional strategy. Trump appeared to be playing towards a theory in modern politics called the

15:59.520 --> 16:05.520
Political Pendulum, not since George Bush in 1992 has one party won the presidential election three

16:05.560 --> 16:11.080
times in a row. In fact, every president since then has been elected for two terms and then

16:11.080 --> 16:16.200
succeeded by a president of the opposing party. Trump was seemingly positioning his political

16:16.200 --> 16:20.840
affiliation to give himself the greatest advantage if he were to consider running for president. So

16:20.840 --> 16:26.320
after Barack Obama was elected president in 2008, completing the Democratic Party trifecta of the

16:26.320 --> 16:32.000
presidency, the Senate majority, and the House majority, Trump's choice became clear. He had

16:32.000 --> 16:37.080
to run as a Republican, and this ultimately made the most sense for Trump and gave him the best

16:37.080 --> 16:41.720
chance of winning. Trump was aging, and so were his admirers from the 80s. I've been now around

16:41.720 --> 16:45.680
long, you know, I think of myself as a young guy, but I'm not so young anymore. Older people tend

16:45.680 --> 16:54.320
to vote Republican, so all Trump had to do was give them what they wanted. At this point, Trump

16:54.320 --> 16:59.200
was well known by the public, and he had his political party. Now all he had left to do was

16:59.200 --> 17:04.640
his biggest challenge yet, getting enough people to vote for him. The year is 2009, and the world

17:04.640 --> 17:09.240
has become a very different place since Trump first entered the public eye. The once friendly

17:09.240 --> 17:14.000
mainstream media had become politically charged and divided. The rise of the internet provided

17:14.000 --> 17:19.640
humanity with a tremendous gift and a debilitating curse. Information was more accessible than ever,

17:19.640 --> 17:25.240
yet truth seemed harder than ever to find. Americans have become more politicized, cynical,

17:25.240 --> 17:30.880
and distrustful than ever before. Celebrities now faced unprecedented scrutiny from the public,

17:30.880 --> 17:36.640
with one slip-up having the potential of becoming national news. As you can see, Trump had quite the

17:36.640 --> 17:41.680
uphill battle ahead of him, but luckily for him, one other thing had changed since the 80s. Memes!

17:41.680 --> 17:47.400
Thanks to the internet, memes now had more influence over people than ever before, and if

17:47.400 --> 17:52.880
Trump knew one thing, it was how to make good memes. If you look back in recent history,

17:53.120 --> 17:56.760
presidential legacies are remembered most fundamentally through memes.

17:56.760 --> 18:01.960
Because people have got to know whether or not their president's a crook. Well, I'm not a crook.

18:01.960 --> 18:11.800
Tear down this wall. Read my lips. I did not have sexual relations with that woman.

18:11.800 --> 18:16.880
And we use these little memes from the past to judge their whole reputation in the present.

18:16.880 --> 18:21.960
Two of the most fondly remembered presidents of the 20th century are Franklin Roosevelt and John F.

18:21.960 --> 18:26.640
Kennedy, and unsurprisingly, they have been responsible for two of the most recognizable

18:26.640 --> 18:37.600
quotations of all time. That the only thing we have to fear is fear itself. Ask not what your

18:37.600 --> 18:44.200
country can do for you. Ask what you can do for your country. Both of these presidents were very

18:44.200 --> 18:49.160
skilled communicators, so they broke their language down into memes to make their speeches

18:49.160 --> 18:55.080
more memorable and impactful. But FDR and JFK also had something else in common. In order for

18:55.080 --> 19:00.240
a meme to spread, it must have a means of spreading, and both of these presidents utilized

19:00.240 --> 19:05.120
new methods of technology in order to spread their messages. FDR was the first president to

19:05.120 --> 19:10.160
regularly address America using the radio, and for many Americans listening to FDR speak with

19:10.160 --> 19:15.760
his own voice in their own homes established an unprecedented new connection between the president

19:15.760 --> 19:20.200
and the public. There's a reason why FDR was the only president elected four times in a row.

19:20.200 --> 19:25.600
Americans really trusted him, and much of that trust was built upon not the content, but the

19:25.600 --> 19:31.840
means of his communication. Similarly, JFK became the first television president. During the 1960

19:31.840 --> 19:36.160
election, a key turning point came during the first televised presidential debate in history

19:36.160 --> 19:41.360
between JFK and Richard Nixon. Kennedy used the televised broadcast to his advantage, appearing

19:41.360 --> 19:46.880
much more confident and photogenic than Nixon. 70 million Americans watched the debates, and most

19:46.880 --> 19:51.400
of them left with the impression that Kennedy had won, momentum that Kennedy used to narrowly win

19:51.400 --> 19:57.680
the election. Once again, the means of communication made the difference in the election. So just as

19:57.680 --> 20:03.920
FDR used the radio and JFK used the television, Donald Trump used Twitter to give himself an

20:03.920 --> 20:09.000
advantage over other candidates. That's right, Trump's Twitter. Donald Trump's Twitter is his

20:09.000 --> 20:14.800
greatest weakness, but also his greatest strength. Donald Trump's Twitter opens him up to the most

20:14.800 --> 20:20.480
tremendous amount of scrutiny that any presidential candidate has ever had to face. Trump's tweets are

20:20.480 --> 20:26.800
unfiltered, uncensored, and unsubstantiated. Any controversial thing he says puts a big giant

20:26.800 --> 20:32.640
glowing target on his back visible to the entire world. So considering all of this, how could Trump's

20:32.640 --> 20:38.640
Twitter possibly give him an advantage? The answer is means. Twitter is an exceptional site for the

20:38.680 --> 20:44.520
spread of memes. The fundamental mechanics of Twitter as a social network facilitate the viral

20:44.520 --> 20:49.480
spread of information. In order for Trump to rebrand himself as a politician, he would have to use

20:49.480 --> 20:54.720
Twitter to spread his messages as efficiently as possible. Twitter would allow Trump to deliver

20:54.720 --> 20:59.640
words from his brain directly to the American people. And there are two things that spread

20:59.640 --> 21:06.360
furthest on Twitter. Controversy and memes. Donald Trump was about to take the site by storm with

21:06.360 --> 21:22.760
some controversial memes. All of the pieces were in place for Trump to begin his presidential

21:22.760 --> 21:28.320
gambit. Trump had his audience, his direction, and his vehicle for a hostile takeover of American

21:28.320 --> 21:33.720
politics. Now was the time for action. Nobody was prepared for what Trump was about to do. Maybe

21:33.760 --> 21:37.960
that's why they were so shocked. Maybe that's why they were so mad. You had to be a little mad

21:37.960 --> 21:42.680
to realize what Trump was doing. Trump was about to rise to political power, and he was about to

21:42.680 --> 21:48.720
do so through the dark arts of weaponized memes. Only the dankest minds on the internet had

21:48.720 --> 21:52.840
theorized their existence, but nobody thought that anyone in power would actually be mad enough to

21:52.840 --> 21:57.280
use them, much less a presidential candidate. Most people just see memes as harmless fun,

21:57.280 --> 22:01.860
and most of the time that's just what they are. But memes have a dark side. Just as they have the

22:01.860 --> 22:07.420
power to build people up, memes have the power to tear people down. Howard Dean was a guy who

22:07.420 --> 22:12.540
ran for president in 2004. He was a good candidate who was pretty much ahead of his time. Dean had

22:12.540 --> 22:17.220
pioneered the strategy of using the internet for grassroots fundraising. Dean used this strategy

22:17.220 --> 22:22.900
to become a clear Democratic frontrunner heading into the Iowa caucus, and then it all came crashing

22:23.820 --> 22:29.460
We're going to South Dakota, and Oregon, and Washington, and Michigan, and then we're going

22:29.460 --> 22:31.460
to Washington DC to take back the White House!

22:52.900 --> 23:17.540
This one soundbite, a tiny innocent slip-up. This was enough to destroy Howard Dean's entire

23:17.540 --> 23:22.260
campaign. All that preparation, all the years grinding and working his way up the political

23:22.500 --> 23:27.580
chain, all the strategizing, all of Dean's policies, his platform, his entire political

23:27.580 --> 23:34.060
agenda, none of it mattered. Howard Dean's campaign was completely destroyed by one little meme.

23:34.060 --> 23:40.500
Trump was well aware of the capacity for memes to destroy a candidate. He understood how the

23:40.500 --> 23:46.180
American media worked, being a subject of it for 30 years. He recognized their capacity to eviscerate

23:46.180 --> 23:51.460
the public image of any candidate, and he knew how to avoid that fate. Donald Trump was ready

23:51.460 --> 23:56.660
to become president, and here's how he did it. Now, the first order of business is to blame

23:56.660 --> 24:02.460
everything on the guy before me. We start in March 2011. Trump had previously teased a run for

24:02.460 --> 24:07.300
president in the 2012 election, but ultimately decided against it despite being one of the

24:07.300 --> 24:12.300
highest polling candidates. Trump decides to attack President Obama about the validity of

24:12.300 --> 24:16.500
his birth certificate. Beginning in July, Trump brings his political rantings to his Twitter

24:16.500 --> 24:20.940
account. Trump's comments are highly controversial and draw heavy media attention. Through this

24:20.940 --> 24:25.940
experience, Trump sacrifices his relatively clean public image to liberals and the political

24:25.940 --> 24:31.580
establishment while endearing himself to hardcore conservatives. Trump initiates his transition from

24:31.580 --> 24:37.700
celebrity to political figurehead. Trump continues his criticism of Obama in the 2012. During this

24:37.700 --> 24:42.780
year, he witnesses Mitt Romney run a squeaky clean campaign in which he keeps controversy to a bare

24:42.780 --> 24:48.060
minimum. Romney runs one of the most bland and cautious campaigns in recent history up until

24:48.060 --> 24:56.700
his infamous 47% comment. Over the course of the 2012 election, Trump would double down on his

24:56.700 --> 25:02.100
anti-Obama crusade, slamming the president on almost every opportunity. Trump didn't let up. He

25:02.100 --> 25:07.180
didn't let up for more than three years. Once again, this was all part of his transition from

25:07.180 --> 25:14.620
celebrity to politician. And on June 15, 2015, Donald Trump announced to the world that he was

25:14.620 --> 25:19.460
running for president. He spoke for over 45 minutes, but only two things stuck out. I will

25:19.460 --> 25:27.460
build a great, great wall on our southern border, and we are going to make our country great again.

25:27.460 --> 25:32.140
And as you would probably expect, no one took him seriously. Everyone laughed at him. The things

25:32.140 --> 25:38.020
Trump said were just so ridiculous and ridiculed he was. Trump got ridiculed in the news, ridiculed

25:38.020 --> 25:44.180
on talk shows, ridiculed on Facebook, Twitter, YouTube. Overnight, Trump became a national pariah.

25:44.420 --> 25:48.780
Many would have called Trump's debut a total disaster, but it wasn't. Donald Trump had actually

25:48.780 --> 25:54.260
made one of the greatest presidential debuts of all time. Why? Because it got people talking. On

25:54.260 --> 26:00.540
every news network across America, on your Twitter feed, on your Facebook feed, everyone was talking

26:00.540 --> 26:05.900
about Trump. They saw his big, bold logo. They questioned building a wall, and they debated

26:05.900 --> 26:11.420
making America great again. Through his debut, we can perfectly observe the duality of Trump's meme

26:11.460 --> 26:17.700
strategy. Offense and defense. Let's start with his first meme. Build a wall. It's offensive. It's

26:17.700 --> 26:23.460
controversial. Controversy leads to attention, and attention leads to a viral meme. And then we have

26:23.460 --> 26:28.740
the opposite kind of meme. Make America great again, which is perhaps the most effective

26:28.740 --> 26:35.020
campaign slogan of the 21st century. It's a meme that is inherently defensive. It relies on

26:35.020 --> 26:40.560
supporters rallying around it and spouting the same message to more and more people. These two

26:40.600 --> 26:45.000
memes were the building blocks of Trump's campaign. They gave him attention. They gave him

26:45.000 --> 26:52.560
support. But most importantly, they gave him a clear direction. Politics are complicated. A lot

26:52.560 --> 26:58.000
of Americans get mad about politics, but very few Americans actually understand politics. Most

26:58.000 --> 27:02.200
Americans just don't have the time to research politics. Some Americans are just too lazy, and

27:02.200 --> 27:07.360
some Americans are just too stupid. Many politicians struggle to communicate their platform

27:07.360 --> 27:12.000
to anyone short of the most advanced observers, because their messages are just too complicated.

27:12.000 --> 27:18.800
As a result, they're ignored and forgotten. Trump understood this. His solution was to use memes to

27:18.800 --> 27:25.360
communicate a simple message to as many people as possible, because after all, a meme is the fastest

27:25.360 --> 27:31.120
way to put an idea in someone's head. Donald Trump began his celebrity status as a media darling. He

27:31.120 --> 27:36.400
was about to become their worst enemy. For the next 18 months, Donald Trump would throttle the

27:36.400 --> 27:42.120
media with an endless stream of controversial bits, quips, and memes. Because they asked me

27:42.120 --> 27:47.520
what I'd do, and I said, I'm gonna bomb the shit out of them. Look at my African-American over here.

27:47.520 --> 27:53.200
And I watch our police and our firemen down in 7-Eleven, down at the World Trade Center. Autism

27:53.200 --> 27:59.240
has become an epidemic. Every news channel in America essentially became Trump TV. The media

27:59.240 --> 28:04.320
wanted desperately to tear him down, just as they had done with Mitt Romney and Howard Dean. But

28:04.360 --> 28:09.920
Trump was different. Both Romney and Dean had a single controversial moment that drew all of the

28:09.920 --> 28:15.560
media's focus. Trump gave the media a new controversial moment every week. The media

28:15.560 --> 28:20.480
couldn't fixate itself on a single problem, and the problems just sort of faded into the background.

28:20.480 --> 28:25.720
The only common denominator was Donald Trump's name, and Donald Trump would milk the media for

28:25.720 --> 28:31.200
five billion dollars worth of free publicity. Furthermore, by baiting the media to focus on

28:31.200 --> 28:37.680
petty, self-made controversy, Trump overshadowed his most glaring weakness, his total lack of

28:37.680 --> 28:45.200
political expertise. NBC, CNN, and even Fox News were all trying to destroy him, but little did

28:45.200 --> 28:50.000
they know they were actually playing right into Trump's advantage and spreading his memes further

28:50.000 --> 28:55.680
than campaign advertising ever could. There was no turning back. Trump was sacrificing his entire

28:55.680 --> 29:01.840
public image, his whole legacy, for a shot at becoming president. Trump was all-in, and the

29:01.840 --> 29:12.520
media called his bluff. Game on! In order to become president, Trump had to first become the Republican

29:12.520 --> 29:18.080
Party nominee. He entered a field with 16 other Republican candidates, the largest field of any

29:18.080 --> 29:22.920
party in American history. You'd think that this would provide Trump with a huge struggle, but once

29:22.920 --> 29:28.400
again, it actually played into his advantage. Thanks to the extremely disproportionate amount

29:28.400 --> 29:33.800
of media coverage on Trump in both news broadcasts and televised debates, Americans viewed the whole

29:33.800 --> 29:39.640
Republican primary process as Trump versus the field. Even though the other candidates were real

29:39.640 --> 29:44.840
politicians with real political experience, they simply couldn't get their brands out there to the

29:44.840 --> 29:50.000
people because Trump soaked up everyone's attention. Since there were so many Republican

29:50.000 --> 29:55.640
candidates starving to share airtime with Trump, no one could get adequate coverage. They all just

29:55.640 --> 30:00.720
kind of tripped over each other. And heading into the Republican debates, only a few candidates even

30:00.720 --> 30:05.760
posed a threat to Trump. And if you thought that these veteran politicians would humiliate Trump

30:05.760 --> 30:11.520
in a real political debate, then you'd be wrong again. Trump shut down all of them with simple

30:11.520 --> 30:18.200
name-calling. But not just any name-calling, Trump eliminated his competition with weaponized memes.

30:18.320 --> 30:22.560
The weakest person on the stage by far is Jeb Bush.

30:22.560 --> 30:26.080
And we don't need a weak person being president of the United States, okay?

30:26.080 --> 30:28.200
You're gonna have to get out there yourself, Jeb.

30:28.200 --> 30:32.360
Weak. Weak, pathetic people. Low energy is a better term.

30:32.360 --> 30:35.800
Don't worry about it, little Marco. Little Marco, little Marco.

30:35.800 --> 30:42.600
Now you look at Kasich, I have never seen a human being eat in such a disgusting fashion.

30:42.600 --> 30:46.920
It's disgusting. Do you want that for your president? I don't think so.

30:47.000 --> 30:51.080
But it's not what you said in the op-ed. Breathe, breathe, breathe.

30:51.080 --> 30:56.920
Lyin' Ted, I call him Lyin' Ted. He holds up the Bible and then he puts it down and he lies, okay? Lyin' Ted.

30:56.920 --> 31:02.440
You may think that this is completely ridiculous, and that childish name-calling could never supplant

31:02.440 --> 31:06.760
real political argumentation, but the results speak for themselves.

31:06.760 --> 31:13.960
You've called women you don't like fat pigs, dogs, slobs, and disgusting animals.

31:13.960 --> 31:16.200
Your Twitter account. Only Rosie O'Donnell.

31:18.120 --> 31:19.000
I know it wasn't.

31:23.880 --> 31:29.480
The Iowa caucuses took place on February 1st, 2016. Even at this early point in the race,

31:29.480 --> 31:33.400
five candidates already dropped out because they couldn't gain any sort of traction

31:33.400 --> 31:37.080
over the oversaturated field. And in the Iowa caucuses,

31:37.080 --> 31:42.280
Donald Trump earned more votes than all but one candidate. This wasn't a joke anymore.

31:42.280 --> 31:48.120
This was for real. These votes counted. The voters were validating Trump as a serious candidate.

31:48.120 --> 31:53.160
His strategies were working. After the caucuses, three more candidates withdrew from the race.

31:53.160 --> 31:58.040
On February 9th, Trump won the New Hampshire primary. Three more candidates withdrew.

31:58.040 --> 32:03.320
On the 20th, Trump won South Carolina. He was now the clear front-runner in the race.

32:03.320 --> 32:08.760
Jeb Bush, who many political pundits viewed as an early favorite, dropped out of the race

32:08.760 --> 32:14.600
after just three states elections. By mid-March, just two other candidates remained. And on May 3rd,

32:14.600 --> 32:20.440
Ted Cruz dropped out of the race, leaving Donald Trump as the presumptive Republican nominee.

32:20.440 --> 32:25.880
Trump didn't just defeat his opponents. He crushed them. Donald Trump won the nomination

32:25.880 --> 32:30.600
with the largest margin of victory in the history of the Republican primaries.

32:30.600 --> 32:35.880
He took a struggling and divided party and united it under a single platform.

32:35.880 --> 32:42.600
Donald Trump was THE Republican candidate, and he had just one more challenge separating him from the presidency.

32:42.600 --> 32:49.240
You guys know the story after this. What followed was one of those brutal and divisive elections in American history.

32:49.240 --> 32:56.120
Both candidates engaged in what was essentially meme warfare. Clinton's email servers versus Trump's pussy grab.

32:56.120 --> 33:01.400
Racist Donald versus Crooked Hillary. Legend has it that at some point the candidates talked about

33:01.400 --> 33:06.840
actual political issues, but historians still dispute this. Anyway, at the end of the day Trump

33:06.840 --> 33:11.960
had better memes than Hillary. Make America Great Again is just so much more of an impactful

33:11.960 --> 33:18.680
campaign slogan than Hillary's. What was hers again? Love Trump's hate? It literally has Trump's name in it.

33:18.680 --> 33:27.320
That can't be right. Maybe it was America is great because America is good. The hell does that even mean?

33:27.320 --> 33:35.080
Oh, I got it. Her real campaign slogan was Pokemon go to the polls. On November 8th, 2016,

33:35.080 --> 33:41.400
Americans Pokemon went to the polls and elected Donald Trump President of the United States.

33:41.400 --> 33:46.760
And you can complain all you want about it. You can call the system rigged. You can say he cheated.

33:46.760 --> 33:52.280
You can riot in the streets. You can call everyone who voted for Trump a racist, sexist, homophobic,

33:52.280 --> 33:57.560
transphobic moron. You can do whatever you want, but it won't change the fact that Donald Trump,

33:57.560 --> 34:03.480
a man with no formal political experience, used memes to get elected to the most powerful

34:03.480 --> 34:08.760
political office in the world. And sure, he might have trashed the rest of America to do it,

34:08.760 --> 34:12.360
but you know what they say, the end justifies the memes.

34:15.240 --> 34:18.760
This sounds like political presidential talk to me and I know people have talked to you about

34:18.760 --> 34:21.720
whether or not you want to run. You've said though that if you did run for president you

34:21.720 --> 34:25.720
believe you'd win. Well, I don't know. I think I'd win. I tell you what, I wouldn't go in to lose.

34:25.720 --> 34:34.040
But hey, that's just a theory. A meme theory. Thanks for unsubscribing.

34:51.720 --> 35:04.040
Thank you.
