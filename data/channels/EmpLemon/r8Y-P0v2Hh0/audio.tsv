0	8080	It's morning again in America. Today, more men and women will go to work than ever before
8080	15400	in our country's history. With interest rates at about half the record highs of 1980, nearly
15400	23200	2,000 families today will buy a new home.
23200	27800	Yep, that's us. You're probably wondering how we ended up in this situation. How did
27800	33120	he do it? How did Donald Trump win the presidential election? It's been one whole year since he
33120	37440	did it, and it still doesn't even feel real. I mean, you're telling me the guy who shaved
37440	41480	Vince McMahon's head and got stunnered by Stone Cold Steve Austin at WrestleMania just
41480	46560	a decade ago is now the elected leader of the most powerful nation on Earth? Now, there
46560	51440	are lots of theories out there trying to explain how Trump won. Theories about Russians, collusion,
51440	57780	neo-fascism, populism, Democratic Party incompetence, exploitation of an antiquated electoral system.
57780	61720	But I'm not going to talk about any of that. Now, before I get into the video, I've got
61720	67040	to give you guys full disclosure. This is not a political video. This is simply a video
67040	71720	analyzing and discussing one man's rise to political power. I understand that the man
71720	76640	I'm discussing is perhaps the most controversial figure of the 21st century so far, but I don't
76640	80360	really give a shit. So you can go ahead and scorch that comment section all you want about
80360	84840	political arguments. You'll just be wasting your time, because this is not a video about
84840	91840	politics. This is a video about memes. This is a video about MEME THEORY.
104480	108500	So at this point a lot of you are probably expecting a video discussing how meme magic,
108500	113400	the cult of Keck, 4chan, and the formation of the alt-right caused Trump to become president.
113400	117240	Now that's not what this video is about either. I really hate to say it, but Pepe didn't cause
117240	121760	Trump to win the election. 4chan didn't cause Trump to win the election. I know it makes
121760	125960	a really fun narrative to pretend that's what happened, but it's just too far-fetched. The
125960	131080	reality is that 4chan is not single-handedly powerful enough to swing an election. Poll
131080	135880	is the driving force behind 4chan's political aura. The board averaged a population of around
135880	141240	130,000 users in the months preceding the election. Now assuming all of those users
141240	145720	are of voting age, and all of those users voted for Trump, which are two pretty lofty
145720	151640	assumptions, that's 130,000 votes on Trump's side. So how do you account for the other
151640	156680	62 and a half million? I mean obviously it's absurd to think that spamming pictures of
156680	161220	frogs can impact a presidential election. Memes are just silly pictures on the internet
161220	165920	after all, and there's no way that something as insignificant as memes can have that much
165920	169200	influence.
170200	172200	Or can they?
181200	184800	You see, when most people think about memes, they think of only just that, silly pictures
184800	190280	on the internet. That's not exactly true. The definition of meme extends much further
190280	195080	than what most people think. The word meme was first coined by Richard Dawkins as a combination
195080	199400	of the English word gene and the Greek word mimea. Essentially a meme is just an element
199400	203480	of human culture that gets reproduced by people sharing it. It's a misconception that memes
203480	207880	have to come from the internet, or that they have to be image templates. Memes can be anything
207880	212760	and they can come from anywhere. Memes can be words, spoken or printed. They can be events,
212760	219120	people, faces, characters, both fictional and real. So if memes can be basically anything,
219120	223720	what's stopping just anything, say a piece of lettuce with a pencil stuck through it,
223760	229000	from becoming a meme? Well, that's where you come in. People decide, and they do it subconsciously.
229000	233400	The most important determining factors in separating memes from ordinary things are
233400	235400	exposure and repetition.
241400	246040	Anything has the potential to become a meme. This is evident in the extreme variety of
246040	250800	memes today. The big meme of the week is seemingly random. However, one of the easiest ways to
250800	256280	understand why memes become popular is to quantify their prior exposure and repetition
256280	261800	through mass media. There's a psychological phenomenon known as the mirror exposure effect,
261800	266280	where people develop preferences for familiar things. Basically, if you repeat something
266280	271320	enough, people will like it. This single principle is what allows brands, icons and memes to
271320	276960	become so widespread. Memes are simply conceptual viruses. Most memes just lay dormant in the
276960	281040	back of people's minds before becoming popular. Maybe it's a cheesy earworm from
281040	285560	a popular song. Maybe it's a zany one-liner from a sitcom. Maybe it's a dumb character
285560	291120	from a childhood cartoon. Like a virus, a meme spreads further if many people become
291120	296920	exposed to it early on. Soon after, a random event triggers the meme to spread. Suddenly,
296920	300840	everyone around you is talking about this meme. You see it show up more and more until
300840	305240	finally you're using it yourself. You have been infected through repetition, and now
305240	310280	you will inevitably infect others. Memes do not spread on their own. They cannot spread
310280	315720	on their own. And just as a biological virus is powerless without a host, memes are powerless
315720	320600	without their host, which happens to be the human brain. Once again, psychology is at
320600	325680	work here. The reason memes exist, spread and influence our culture is that we enjoy
325680	331040	them on a psychological level. Memes are exceptionally appealing to us because of how our brains
331040	335640	understand. Schemas, heuristics, and chunking are all major psychological concepts dictating
335640	340600	that human thought is heavily operated upon the representation of raw information through
340600	346440	small manageable pieces. We understand concepts better by packaging them into familiar bits.
346440	350480	Our brains do this automatically in order to efficiently store information. Memes are
350480	356080	socially generated concepts that reflect our psychological methods for information processing.
356080	361200	Through a meme, it is possible to compress a complex issue, narrative, or emotion into
361200	367080	a single image or phrase. Simply put, a meme is the fastest way to put an idea in someone's
367080	371500	head. So now that we've defined memes and how they work, let's go back to the main question
371500	377160	of this video. How did Trump use them to become president? In order to answer that, we must
377160	381400	first consider how anyone becomes president. In order to become president, one must first
381400	385440	meet the minimum constitutional requirements in addition to becoming an expert on both
385440	390440	international and domestic politics, law, history, and debate. It is paramount that
390440	395360	an aspiring president first spends decades serving in public office or the military slowly
395360	399480	building their reputation, credibility, and experience all while working their way up
399480	404040	the ranks until they're either a US senator, state governor, or military general. It is
404040	408680	only at this point when an American politician can even attempt a presidential campaign and
408680	412840	gain any sort of traction whatsoever. From this point, they must engage in up to 18 months
412840	418560	of arduous strategizing, traveling, fundraising, marketing, and debating in order to persuade
418560	423280	enough people to vote for them to become the nominee of one of the two major American political
423280	427400	parties. And at this point, you just have to hope and pray that half of the voters like
427400	432480	you more than the other guy. And finally, after all that struggle, you can become president
432480	441280	of the United States. Going into 2015, Trump met the bare constitutional requirements.
441600	445360	Maybe we're gonna have to approach this from a different angle. So fuck all this dumb shit
445360	450640	for nerds, how does anyone really become president? Well, in order to achieve the most powerful
450640	456080	position of political power in the world, with no prior political experience, we have
456080	461720	to approach the challenge from a top-down perspective. If you've ever gone to school,
461720	467960	you're probably familiar with the multiple choice test. Now normally, you gotta study
467960	471920	all the material on the test in order to answer the test questions and bubble in the
471920	476400	correct answer choice. But technically, the first two steps aren't necessary in order
476400	480600	to get a good grade. For a multiple choice test, passing the test only really requires
480600	485360	you to bubble in the correct sequence of letters in order. And for this reason, it's possible
485360	490960	to average a 25% on a multiple choice test, even if you know 0% of the information. Just
490960	495760	choose A every time, and 1 out of 4 of your answers will be correct. For a true or false
495760	499360	test, the odds are even more in your favor. By choosing A every time, you'll average
499360	504740	a 50% despite knowing 0% of the information being tested. Now obviously, schools are caught
504740	509880	on to this, which is why 50% is still an F. However, in a two-party electoral system,
509880	515520	50% is usually enough to win you an election. So let's apply this logic to a presidential
515520	520480	election. In order to become president, you need to follow these steps. Step 1, become
520480	524720	easily recognized by the public. You have a much better chance of winning if a bunch
524720	530200	of people already know who you are. Since 1980, almost all presidential elections have
530200	535320	been won by a candidate that was already well known by the American public. Step 2, run
535320	540880	as a Democrat or a Republican. Democrats and Republicans have won every single presidential
540880	545760	election since the Civil War. In order to become president, you must become the nominee
545760	551960	for one of these parties. Step 3, have about 50% of the voters vote for you. Partisan politics
551960	556440	have become an epidemic. You could host the most clumsy and awkward campaign ever, and
556440	560560	about half the voters will still vote for you because you have a D or an R next to your
560560	565200	name. Weak candidates can use this to their advantage. Since 1980, the winning president
565200	569880	has almost always won with close to 50% of the popular vote. Sometimes they won with
569880	574840	less than 50%. And in order for a long shot like Trump to have any chance of becoming
574840	579840	president, he was going to have to rely on all of these steps. And he did it using memes.
581960	591280	Donald Trump started out as just another wealthy New York City businessman. So what
591280	595760	made him different? Well, Trump just really liked to put his name on stuff. I mean, he
595760	599760	really liked to put his name on stuff. Trump made it clear from early on that his strategy
599760	605160	as a businessman was not to build luxury apartments, but to build himself into a brand. There actually
605160	609840	isn't that much separating a brand from a meme. They're functionally identical. Both
609840	614960	condensed big concepts into a single name or image. Brands are basically just corporate
614960	619660	memes. And it just so happens that Trump was in the perfect position to become a living
619660	624440	meme. Trump is a verb meaning to defeat by doing better. Coincidentally, Trump's own
624440	629680	name succinctly represented the power, prestige, and dominance associated with a wealthy New
629680	635000	York businessman. In 1978, Trump commenced the construction of Trump Tower, a 58-story
635000	639800	luxury skyscraper in Manhattan. The location of Manhattan is important because Manhattan
639800	644640	is the financial and cultural center of New York City, the biggest city in North America.
644640	648640	Manhattan is home to globally renowned landmarks, Times Square, the Empire State Building, the
648640	653440	World Trade Centers, and now Trump Tower. Trump put his name on one of the biggest landmarks
653440	662920	in the heart of New York City, leaving millions to wonder, who is this Trump fellow? In order
662920	667760	for a meme to spread, it must first have a means of spreading. Today, basically every
667760	671720	meme gets spread through the internet. Everyone in our society is connected to the internet,
671720	676600	which makes it the fastest way for ideas and memes to spread. In the 1980s, mass media
676600	680520	was very different. Instead of the internet, almost all Americans got their information
680520	686760	through network television. NBC, CBS, and ABC. And it just so happens that all three
686760	691560	of the major networks had headquarters located in Manhattan, just a few miles away from Trump
691560	696000	Tower. New York City was the center of mass media in the United States, and it would be
696000	700600	this media that would transform Trump from businessman to celebrity. Donald Trump, as
700600	706640	I say, is just 33 years old. He now has an apartment for sale in a new Trump building
706640	711160	called the Trump Tower. Starting around 1980, Donald Trump began to make appearances on
711160	717600	national television. First it was just a few interviews. Then it was cameos. Donald Trump.
718360	724280	Ads. Entire television programs centered around Donald Trump. From the perspective of the networks, they were just
724280	729560	exploiting an easily available resource. Donald Trump was inherently interesting to the American
729560	734480	public. Look at this right here on the street! It's Donald Trump! What are you, morons?
734480	739200	While most billionaire business tycoons try to avoid the spotlight, Trump reveled in it.
739200	743440	Americans just kept seeing this bold, confident man on their television sets over and over
743440	748480	again. The focus wasn't on who he was, but what he represented. You didn't have to know
748480	753760	anything about Trump to recognize that he was rich, tough, and successful, just by the
753760	758240	way he acted on television. Trump embodied the spirit of capitalism that was rampant
758240	764040	in the 80s, and many Americans admired and idolized him as a symbol of wealth and power.
764040	768480	Trump stayed consistently relevant in the American public for 20 years after that. He
768480	771840	had truly become one of the most recognized men in America.
798480	800480	You know, that's his appeal to me.
828480	836480	Uh-oh! You frickin' moron! You just got di-
858480	875600	So by now in our story, Trump had completed the first step in becoming president, becoming well
875600	880840	recognized by the general public. Now he was ready to actually run for president, which he had to do
880840	885960	as either a Democrat or a Republican in order to have any chance of winning. But which party would
885960	889800	give him the best chance of winning? Trump's party affiliation history is actually quite
889800	894080	interesting, and few people are aware of it. Starting in the 80s, Trump was actually regarded
894080	898840	as a Democrat. In 1987, he registered as a Republican and remained that way for about a
898840	904520	decade. Then in 1999, he joined the Independent Reform Party, where he tried to run for president.
904520	909560	That's right, Trump actually launched an exploratory campaign for the 2000 presidential election,
909560	914720	17 years before he became the most controversial political figure in the country. He ended up
914720	918760	dropping out before the primaries due to party infighting, but it's interesting nonetheless.
918760	924240	Then starting in 2001, he was a Democrat again. You identify more as a Democrat or a Republican?
924240	930320	Well, you'd be shocked if I said that in many cases I probably identify more as a Democrat.
930320	936160	Until 2009, when he registered as a Republican again. Now, an average observer would look at
936160	940440	this data and call Trump a flip-clopper, a figurehead that can't make up his mind on
940440	945680	issues. But that's not how I see it. Something's up here, and it becomes apparent when you compare
945680	950400	Trump's party affiliation to the president's party through time. Trump's party position has
950400	954560	almost always been contrarian to the acting president, and I believe that this was an
954560	959520	intentional strategy. Trump appeared to be playing towards a theory in modern politics called the
959520	965520	Political Pendulum, not since George Bush in 1992 has one party won the presidential election three
965560	971080	times in a row. In fact, every president since then has been elected for two terms and then
971080	976200	succeeded by a president of the opposing party. Trump was seemingly positioning his political
976200	980840	affiliation to give himself the greatest advantage if he were to consider running for president. So
980840	986320	after Barack Obama was elected president in 2008, completing the Democratic Party trifecta of the
986320	992000	presidency, the Senate majority, and the House majority, Trump's choice became clear. He had
992000	997080	to run as a Republican, and this ultimately made the most sense for Trump and gave him the best
997080	1001720	chance of winning. Trump was aging, and so were his admirers from the 80s. I've been now around
1001720	1005680	long, you know, I think of myself as a young guy, but I'm not so young anymore. Older people tend
1005680	1014320	to vote Republican, so all Trump had to do was give them what they wanted. At this point, Trump
1014320	1019200	was well known by the public, and he had his political party. Now all he had left to do was
1019200	1024640	his biggest challenge yet, getting enough people to vote for him. The year is 2009, and the world
1024640	1029240	has become a very different place since Trump first entered the public eye. The once friendly
1029240	1034000	mainstream media had become politically charged and divided. The rise of the internet provided
1034000	1039640	humanity with a tremendous gift and a debilitating curse. Information was more accessible than ever,
1039640	1045240	yet truth seemed harder than ever to find. Americans have become more politicized, cynical,
1045240	1050880	and distrustful than ever before. Celebrities now faced unprecedented scrutiny from the public,
1050880	1056640	with one slip-up having the potential of becoming national news. As you can see, Trump had quite the
1056640	1061680	uphill battle ahead of him, but luckily for him, one other thing had changed since the 80s. Memes!
1061680	1067400	Thanks to the internet, memes now had more influence over people than ever before, and if
1067400	1072880	Trump knew one thing, it was how to make good memes. If you look back in recent history,
1073120	1076760	presidential legacies are remembered most fundamentally through memes.
1076760	1081960	Because people have got to know whether or not their president's a crook. Well, I'm not a crook.
1081960	1091800	Tear down this wall. Read my lips. I did not have sexual relations with that woman.
1091800	1096880	And we use these little memes from the past to judge their whole reputation in the present.
1096880	1101960	Two of the most fondly remembered presidents of the 20th century are Franklin Roosevelt and John F.
1101960	1106640	Kennedy, and unsurprisingly, they have been responsible for two of the most recognizable
1106640	1117600	quotations of all time. That the only thing we have to fear is fear itself. Ask not what your
1117600	1124200	country can do for you. Ask what you can do for your country. Both of these presidents were very
1124200	1129160	skilled communicators, so they broke their language down into memes to make their speeches
1129160	1135080	more memorable and impactful. But FDR and JFK also had something else in common. In order for
1135080	1140240	a meme to spread, it must have a means of spreading, and both of these presidents utilized
1140240	1145120	new methods of technology in order to spread their messages. FDR was the first president to
1145120	1150160	regularly address America using the radio, and for many Americans listening to FDR speak with
1150160	1155760	his own voice in their own homes established an unprecedented new connection between the president
1155760	1160200	and the public. There's a reason why FDR was the only president elected four times in a row.
1160200	1165600	Americans really trusted him, and much of that trust was built upon not the content, but the
1165600	1171840	means of his communication. Similarly, JFK became the first television president. During the 1960
1171840	1176160	election, a key turning point came during the first televised presidential debate in history
1176160	1181360	between JFK and Richard Nixon. Kennedy used the televised broadcast to his advantage, appearing
1181360	1186880	much more confident and photogenic than Nixon. 70 million Americans watched the debates, and most
1186880	1191400	of them left with the impression that Kennedy had won, momentum that Kennedy used to narrowly win
1191400	1197680	the election. Once again, the means of communication made the difference in the election. So just as
1197680	1203920	FDR used the radio and JFK used the television, Donald Trump used Twitter to give himself an
1203920	1209000	advantage over other candidates. That's right, Trump's Twitter. Donald Trump's Twitter is his
1209000	1214800	greatest weakness, but also his greatest strength. Donald Trump's Twitter opens him up to the most
1214800	1220480	tremendous amount of scrutiny that any presidential candidate has ever had to face. Trump's tweets are
1220480	1226800	unfiltered, uncensored, and unsubstantiated. Any controversial thing he says puts a big giant
1226800	1232640	glowing target on his back visible to the entire world. So considering all of this, how could Trump's
1232640	1238640	Twitter possibly give him an advantage? The answer is means. Twitter is an exceptional site for the
1238680	1244520	spread of memes. The fundamental mechanics of Twitter as a social network facilitate the viral
1244520	1249480	spread of information. In order for Trump to rebrand himself as a politician, he would have to use
1249480	1254720	Twitter to spread his messages as efficiently as possible. Twitter would allow Trump to deliver
1254720	1259640	words from his brain directly to the American people. And there are two things that spread
1259640	1266360	furthest on Twitter. Controversy and memes. Donald Trump was about to take the site by storm with
1266360	1282760	some controversial memes. All of the pieces were in place for Trump to begin his presidential
1282760	1288320	gambit. Trump had his audience, his direction, and his vehicle for a hostile takeover of American
1288320	1293720	politics. Now was the time for action. Nobody was prepared for what Trump was about to do. Maybe
1293760	1297960	that's why they were so shocked. Maybe that's why they were so mad. You had to be a little mad
1297960	1302680	to realize what Trump was doing. Trump was about to rise to political power, and he was about to
1302680	1308720	do so through the dark arts of weaponized memes. Only the dankest minds on the internet had
1308720	1312840	theorized their existence, but nobody thought that anyone in power would actually be mad enough to
1312840	1317280	use them, much less a presidential candidate. Most people just see memes as harmless fun,
1317280	1321860	and most of the time that's just what they are. But memes have a dark side. Just as they have the
1321860	1327420	power to build people up, memes have the power to tear people down. Howard Dean was a guy who
1327420	1332540	ran for president in 2004. He was a good candidate who was pretty much ahead of his time. Dean had
1332540	1337220	pioneered the strategy of using the internet for grassroots fundraising. Dean used this strategy
1337220	1342900	to become a clear Democratic frontrunner heading into the Iowa caucus, and then it all came crashing
1343820	1349460	We're going to South Dakota, and Oregon, and Washington, and Michigan, and then we're going
1349460	1351460	to Washington DC to take back the White House!
1372900	1397540	This one soundbite, a tiny innocent slip-up. This was enough to destroy Howard Dean's entire
1397540	1402260	campaign. All that preparation, all the years grinding and working his way up the political
1402500	1407580	chain, all the strategizing, all of Dean's policies, his platform, his entire political
1407580	1414060	agenda, none of it mattered. Howard Dean's campaign was completely destroyed by one little meme.
1414060	1420500	Trump was well aware of the capacity for memes to destroy a candidate. He understood how the
1420500	1426180	American media worked, being a subject of it for 30 years. He recognized their capacity to eviscerate
1426180	1431460	the public image of any candidate, and he knew how to avoid that fate. Donald Trump was ready
1431460	1436660	to become president, and here's how he did it. Now, the first order of business is to blame
1436660	1442460	everything on the guy before me. We start in March 2011. Trump had previously teased a run for
1442460	1447300	president in the 2012 election, but ultimately decided against it despite being one of the
1447300	1452300	highest polling candidates. Trump decides to attack President Obama about the validity of
1452300	1456500	his birth certificate. Beginning in July, Trump brings his political rantings to his Twitter
1456500	1460940	account. Trump's comments are highly controversial and draw heavy media attention. Through this
1460940	1465940	experience, Trump sacrifices his relatively clean public image to liberals and the political
1465940	1471580	establishment while endearing himself to hardcore conservatives. Trump initiates his transition from
1471580	1477700	celebrity to political figurehead. Trump continues his criticism of Obama in the 2012. During this
1477700	1482780	year, he witnesses Mitt Romney run a squeaky clean campaign in which he keeps controversy to a bare
1482780	1488060	minimum. Romney runs one of the most bland and cautious campaigns in recent history up until
1488060	1496700	his infamous 47% comment. Over the course of the 2012 election, Trump would double down on his
1496700	1502100	anti-Obama crusade, slamming the president on almost every opportunity. Trump didn't let up. He
1502100	1507180	didn't let up for more than three years. Once again, this was all part of his transition from
1507180	1514620	celebrity to politician. And on June 15, 2015, Donald Trump announced to the world that he was
1514620	1519460	running for president. He spoke for over 45 minutes, but only two things stuck out. I will
1519460	1527460	build a great, great wall on our southern border, and we are going to make our country great again.
1527460	1532140	And as you would probably expect, no one took him seriously. Everyone laughed at him. The things
1532140	1538020	Trump said were just so ridiculous and ridiculed he was. Trump got ridiculed in the news, ridiculed
1538020	1544180	on talk shows, ridiculed on Facebook, Twitter, YouTube. Overnight, Trump became a national pariah.
1544420	1548780	Many would have called Trump's debut a total disaster, but it wasn't. Donald Trump had actually
1548780	1554260	made one of the greatest presidential debuts of all time. Why? Because it got people talking. On
1554260	1560540	every news network across America, on your Twitter feed, on your Facebook feed, everyone was talking
1560540	1565900	about Trump. They saw his big, bold logo. They questioned building a wall, and they debated
1565900	1571420	making America great again. Through his debut, we can perfectly observe the duality of Trump's meme
1571460	1577700	strategy. Offense and defense. Let's start with his first meme. Build a wall. It's offensive. It's
1577700	1583460	controversial. Controversy leads to attention, and attention leads to a viral meme. And then we have
1583460	1588740	the opposite kind of meme. Make America great again, which is perhaps the most effective
1588740	1595020	campaign slogan of the 21st century. It's a meme that is inherently defensive. It relies on
1595020	1600560	supporters rallying around it and spouting the same message to more and more people. These two
1600600	1605000	memes were the building blocks of Trump's campaign. They gave him attention. They gave him
1605000	1612560	support. But most importantly, they gave him a clear direction. Politics are complicated. A lot
1612560	1618000	of Americans get mad about politics, but very few Americans actually understand politics. Most
1618000	1622200	Americans just don't have the time to research politics. Some Americans are just too lazy, and
1622200	1627360	some Americans are just too stupid. Many politicians struggle to communicate their platform
1627360	1632000	to anyone short of the most advanced observers, because their messages are just too complicated.
1632000	1638800	As a result, they're ignored and forgotten. Trump understood this. His solution was to use memes to
1638800	1645360	communicate a simple message to as many people as possible, because after all, a meme is the fastest
1645360	1651120	way to put an idea in someone's head. Donald Trump began his celebrity status as a media darling. He
1651120	1656400	was about to become their worst enemy. For the next 18 months, Donald Trump would throttle the
1656400	1662120	media with an endless stream of controversial bits, quips, and memes. Because they asked me
1662120	1667520	what I'd do, and I said, I'm gonna bomb the shit out of them. Look at my African-American over here.
1667520	1673200	And I watch our police and our firemen down in 7-Eleven, down at the World Trade Center. Autism
1673200	1679240	has become an epidemic. Every news channel in America essentially became Trump TV. The media
1679240	1684320	wanted desperately to tear him down, just as they had done with Mitt Romney and Howard Dean. But
1684360	1689920	Trump was different. Both Romney and Dean had a single controversial moment that drew all of the
1689920	1695560	media's focus. Trump gave the media a new controversial moment every week. The media
1695560	1700480	couldn't fixate itself on a single problem, and the problems just sort of faded into the background.
1700480	1705720	The only common denominator was Donald Trump's name, and Donald Trump would milk the media for
1705720	1711200	five billion dollars worth of free publicity. Furthermore, by baiting the media to focus on
1711200	1717680	petty, self-made controversy, Trump overshadowed his most glaring weakness, his total lack of
1717680	1725200	political expertise. NBC, CNN, and even Fox News were all trying to destroy him, but little did
1725200	1730000	they know they were actually playing right into Trump's advantage and spreading his memes further
1730000	1735680	than campaign advertising ever could. There was no turning back. Trump was sacrificing his entire
1735680	1741840	public image, his whole legacy, for a shot at becoming president. Trump was all-in, and the
1741840	1752520	media called his bluff. Game on! In order to become president, Trump had to first become the Republican
1752520	1758080	Party nominee. He entered a field with 16 other Republican candidates, the largest field of any
1758080	1762920	party in American history. You'd think that this would provide Trump with a huge struggle, but once
1762920	1768400	again, it actually played into his advantage. Thanks to the extremely disproportionate amount
1768400	1773800	of media coverage on Trump in both news broadcasts and televised debates, Americans viewed the whole
1773800	1779640	Republican primary process as Trump versus the field. Even though the other candidates were real
1779640	1784840	politicians with real political experience, they simply couldn't get their brands out there to the
1784840	1790000	people because Trump soaked up everyone's attention. Since there were so many Republican
1790000	1795640	candidates starving to share airtime with Trump, no one could get adequate coverage. They all just
1795640	1800720	kind of tripped over each other. And heading into the Republican debates, only a few candidates even
1800720	1805760	posed a threat to Trump. And if you thought that these veteran politicians would humiliate Trump
1805760	1811520	in a real political debate, then you'd be wrong again. Trump shut down all of them with simple
1811520	1818200	name-calling. But not just any name-calling, Trump eliminated his competition with weaponized memes.
1818320	1822560	The weakest person on the stage by far is Jeb Bush.
1822560	1826080	And we don't need a weak person being president of the United States, okay?
1826080	1828200	You're gonna have to get out there yourself, Jeb.
1828200	1832360	Weak. Weak, pathetic people. Low energy is a better term.
1832360	1835800	Don't worry about it, little Marco. Little Marco, little Marco.
1835800	1842600	Now you look at Kasich, I have never seen a human being eat in such a disgusting fashion.
1842600	1846920	It's disgusting. Do you want that for your president? I don't think so.
1847000	1851080	But it's not what you said in the op-ed. Breathe, breathe, breathe.
1851080	1856920	Lyin' Ted, I call him Lyin' Ted. He holds up the Bible and then he puts it down and he lies, okay? Lyin' Ted.
1856920	1862440	You may think that this is completely ridiculous, and that childish name-calling could never supplant
1862440	1866760	real political argumentation, but the results speak for themselves.
1866760	1873960	You've called women you don't like fat pigs, dogs, slobs, and disgusting animals.
1873960	1876200	Your Twitter account. Only Rosie O'Donnell.
1878120	1879000	I know it wasn't.
1883880	1889480	The Iowa caucuses took place on February 1st, 2016. Even at this early point in the race,
1889480	1893400	five candidates already dropped out because they couldn't gain any sort of traction
1893400	1897080	over the oversaturated field. And in the Iowa caucuses,
1897080	1902280	Donald Trump earned more votes than all but one candidate. This wasn't a joke anymore.
1902280	1908120	This was for real. These votes counted. The voters were validating Trump as a serious candidate.
1908120	1913160	His strategies were working. After the caucuses, three more candidates withdrew from the race.
1913160	1918040	On February 9th, Trump won the New Hampshire primary. Three more candidates withdrew.
1918040	1923320	On the 20th, Trump won South Carolina. He was now the clear front-runner in the race.
1923320	1928760	Jeb Bush, who many political pundits viewed as an early favorite, dropped out of the race
1928760	1934600	after just three states elections. By mid-March, just two other candidates remained. And on May 3rd,
1934600	1940440	Ted Cruz dropped out of the race, leaving Donald Trump as the presumptive Republican nominee.
1940440	1945880	Trump didn't just defeat his opponents. He crushed them. Donald Trump won the nomination
1945880	1950600	with the largest margin of victory in the history of the Republican primaries.
1950600	1955880	He took a struggling and divided party and united it under a single platform.
1955880	1962600	Donald Trump was THE Republican candidate, and he had just one more challenge separating him from the presidency.
1962600	1969240	You guys know the story after this. What followed was one of those brutal and divisive elections in American history.
1969240	1976120	Both candidates engaged in what was essentially meme warfare. Clinton's email servers versus Trump's pussy grab.
1976120	1981400	Racist Donald versus Crooked Hillary. Legend has it that at some point the candidates talked about
1981400	1986840	actual political issues, but historians still dispute this. Anyway, at the end of the day Trump
1986840	1991960	had better memes than Hillary. Make America Great Again is just so much more of an impactful
1991960	1998680	campaign slogan than Hillary's. What was hers again? Love Trump's hate? It literally has Trump's name in it.
1998680	2007320	That can't be right. Maybe it was America is great because America is good. The hell does that even mean?
2007320	2015080	Oh, I got it. Her real campaign slogan was Pokemon go to the polls. On November 8th, 2016,
2015080	2021400	Americans Pokemon went to the polls and elected Donald Trump President of the United States.
2021400	2026760	And you can complain all you want about it. You can call the system rigged. You can say he cheated.
2026760	2032280	You can riot in the streets. You can call everyone who voted for Trump a racist, sexist, homophobic,
2032280	2037560	transphobic moron. You can do whatever you want, but it won't change the fact that Donald Trump,
2037560	2043480	a man with no formal political experience, used memes to get elected to the most powerful
2043480	2048760	political office in the world. And sure, he might have trashed the rest of America to do it,
2048760	2052360	but you know what they say, the end justifies the memes.
2055240	2058760	This sounds like political presidential talk to me and I know people have talked to you about
2058760	2061720	whether or not you want to run. You've said though that if you did run for president you
2061720	2065720	believe you'd win. Well, I don't know. I think I'd win. I tell you what, I wouldn't go in to lose.
2065720	2074040	But hey, that's just a theory. A meme theory. Thanks for unsubscribing.
2091720	2104040	Thank you.
