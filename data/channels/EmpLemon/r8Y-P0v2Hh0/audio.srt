1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,080
It's morning again in America. Today, more men and women will go to work than ever before

2
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:15,400
in our country's history. With interest rates at about half the record highs of 1980, nearly

3
00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:23,200
2,000 families today will buy a new home.

4
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:27,800
Yep, that's us. You're probably wondering how we ended up in this situation. How did

5
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:33,120
he do it? How did Donald Trump win the presidential election? It's been one whole year since he

6
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:37,440
did it, and it still doesn't even feel real. I mean, you're telling me the guy who shaved

7
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:41,480
Vince McMahon's head and got stunnered by Stone Cold Steve Austin at WrestleMania just

8
00:00:41,480 --> 00:00:46,560
a decade ago is now the elected leader of the most powerful nation on Earth? Now, there

9
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:51,440
are lots of theories out there trying to explain how Trump won. Theories about Russians, collusion,

10
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:57,780
neo-fascism, populism, Democratic Party incompetence, exploitation of an antiquated electoral system.

11
00:00:57,780 --> 00:01:01,720
But I'm not going to talk about any of that. Now, before I get into the video, I've got

12
00:01:01,720 --> 00:01:07,040
to give you guys full disclosure. This is not a political video. This is simply a video

13
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:11,720
analyzing and discussing one man's rise to political power. I understand that the man

14
00:01:11,720 --> 00:01:16,640
I'm discussing is perhaps the most controversial figure of the 21st century so far, but I don't

15
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:20,360
really give a shit. So you can go ahead and scorch that comment section all you want about

16
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:24,840
political arguments. You'll just be wasting your time, because this is not a video about

17
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:31,840
politics. This is a video about memes. This is a video about MEME THEORY.

18
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:48,500
So at this point a lot of you are probably expecting a video discussing how meme magic,

19
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:53,400
the cult of Keck, 4chan, and the formation of the alt-right caused Trump to become president.

20
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:57,240
Now that's not what this video is about either. I really hate to say it, but Pepe didn't cause

21
00:01:57,240 --> 00:02:01,760
Trump to win the election. 4chan didn't cause Trump to win the election. I know it makes

22
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:05,960
a really fun narrative to pretend that's what happened, but it's just too far-fetched. The

23
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:11,080
reality is that 4chan is not single-handedly powerful enough to swing an election. Poll

24
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:15,880
is the driving force behind 4chan's political aura. The board averaged a population of around

25
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:21,240
130,000 users in the months preceding the election. Now assuming all of those users

26
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:25,720
are of voting age, and all of those users voted for Trump, which are two pretty lofty

27
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:31,640
assumptions, that's 130,000 votes on Trump's side. So how do you account for the other

28
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:36,680
62 and a half million? I mean obviously it's absurd to think that spamming pictures of

29
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:41,220
frogs can impact a presidential election. Memes are just silly pictures on the internet

30
00:02:41,220 --> 00:02:45,920
after all, and there's no way that something as insignificant as memes can have that much

31
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:49,200
influence.

32
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:52,200
Or can they?

33
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:04,800
You see, when most people think about memes, they think of only just that, silly pictures

34
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:10,280
on the internet. That's not exactly true. The definition of meme extends much further

35
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:15,080
than what most people think. The word meme was first coined by Richard Dawkins as a combination

36
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:19,400
of the English word gene and the Greek word mimea. Essentially a meme is just an element

37
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:23,480
of human culture that gets reproduced by people sharing it. It's a misconception that memes

38
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:27,880
have to come from the internet, or that they have to be image templates. Memes can be anything

39
00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:32,760
and they can come from anywhere. Memes can be words, spoken or printed. They can be events,

40
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:39,120
people, faces, characters, both fictional and real. So if memes can be basically anything,

41
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:43,720
what's stopping just anything, say a piece of lettuce with a pencil stuck through it,

42
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:49,000
from becoming a meme? Well, that's where you come in. People decide, and they do it subconsciously.

43
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:53,400
The most important determining factors in separating memes from ordinary things are

44
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:55,400
exposure and repetition.

45
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:06,040
Anything has the potential to become a meme. This is evident in the extreme variety of

46
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:10,800
memes today. The big meme of the week is seemingly random. However, one of the easiest ways to

47
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:16,280
understand why memes become popular is to quantify their prior exposure and repetition

48
00:04:16,280 --> 00:04:21,800
through mass media. There's a psychological phenomenon known as the mirror exposure effect,

49
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:26,280
where people develop preferences for familiar things. Basically, if you repeat something

50
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:31,320
enough, people will like it. This single principle is what allows brands, icons and memes to

51
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:36,960
become so widespread. Memes are simply conceptual viruses. Most memes just lay dormant in the

52
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:41,040
back of people's minds before becoming popular. Maybe it's a cheesy earworm from

53
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:45,560
a popular song. Maybe it's a zany one-liner from a sitcom. Maybe it's a dumb character

54
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:51,120
from a childhood cartoon. Like a virus, a meme spreads further if many people become

55
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:56,920
exposed to it early on. Soon after, a random event triggers the meme to spread. Suddenly,

56
00:04:56,920 --> 00:05:00,840
everyone around you is talking about this meme. You see it show up more and more until

57
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:05,240
finally you're using it yourself. You have been infected through repetition, and now

58
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:10,280
you will inevitably infect others. Memes do not spread on their own. They cannot spread

59
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:15,720
on their own. And just as a biological virus is powerless without a host, memes are powerless

60
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:20,600
without their host, which happens to be the human brain. Once again, psychology is at

61
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:25,680
work here. The reason memes exist, spread and influence our culture is that we enjoy

62
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:31,040
them on a psychological level. Memes are exceptionally appealing to us because of how our brains

63
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:35,640
understand. Schemas, heuristics, and chunking are all major psychological concepts dictating

64
00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:40,600
that human thought is heavily operated upon the representation of raw information through

65
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:46,440
small manageable pieces. We understand concepts better by packaging them into familiar bits.

66
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:50,480
Our brains do this automatically in order to efficiently store information. Memes are

67
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:56,080
socially generated concepts that reflect our psychological methods for information processing.

68
00:05:56,080 --> 00:06:01,200
Through a meme, it is possible to compress a complex issue, narrative, or emotion into

69
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:07,080
a single image or phrase. Simply put, a meme is the fastest way to put an idea in someone's

70
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:11,500
head. So now that we've defined memes and how they work, let's go back to the main question

71
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:17,160
of this video. How did Trump use them to become president? In order to answer that, we must

72
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:21,400
first consider how anyone becomes president. In order to become president, one must first

73
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:25,440
meet the minimum constitutional requirements in addition to becoming an expert on both

74
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:30,440
international and domestic politics, law, history, and debate. It is paramount that

75
00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:35,360
an aspiring president first spends decades serving in public office or the military slowly

76
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:39,480
building their reputation, credibility, and experience all while working their way up

77
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:44,040
the ranks until they're either a US senator, state governor, or military general. It is

78
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:48,680
only at this point when an American politician can even attempt a presidential campaign and

79
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:52,840
gain any sort of traction whatsoever. From this point, they must engage in up to 18 months

80
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:58,560
of arduous strategizing, traveling, fundraising, marketing, and debating in order to persuade

81
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:03,280
enough people to vote for them to become the nominee of one of the two major American political

82
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:07,400
parties. And at this point, you just have to hope and pray that half of the voters like

83
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:12,480
you more than the other guy. And finally, after all that struggle, you can become president

84
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:21,280
of the United States. Going into 2015, Trump met the bare constitutional requirements.

85
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:25,360
Maybe we're gonna have to approach this from a different angle. So fuck all this dumb shit

86
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:30,640
for nerds, how does anyone really become president? Well, in order to achieve the most powerful

87
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:36,080
position of political power in the world, with no prior political experience, we have

88
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:41,720
to approach the challenge from a top-down perspective. If you've ever gone to school,

89
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:47,960
you're probably familiar with the multiple choice test. Now normally, you gotta study

90
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:51,920
all the material on the test in order to answer the test questions and bubble in the

91
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:56,400
correct answer choice. But technically, the first two steps aren't necessary in order

92
00:07:56,400 --> 00:08:00,600
to get a good grade. For a multiple choice test, passing the test only really requires

93
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:05,360
you to bubble in the correct sequence of letters in order. And for this reason, it's possible

94
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:10,960
to average a 25% on a multiple choice test, even if you know 0% of the information. Just

95
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:15,760
choose A every time, and 1 out of 4 of your answers will be correct. For a true or false

96
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:19,360
test, the odds are even more in your favor. By choosing A every time, you'll average

97
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:24,740
a 50% despite knowing 0% of the information being tested. Now obviously, schools are caught

98
00:08:24,740 --> 00:08:29,880
on to this, which is why 50% is still an F. However, in a two-party electoral system,

99
00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:35,520
50% is usually enough to win you an election. So let's apply this logic to a presidential

100
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:40,480
election. In order to become president, you need to follow these steps. Step 1, become

101
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:44,720
easily recognized by the public. You have a much better chance of winning if a bunch

102
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:50,200
of people already know who you are. Since 1980, almost all presidential elections have

103
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:55,320
been won by a candidate that was already well known by the American public. Step 2, run

104
00:08:55,320 --> 00:09:00,880
as a Democrat or a Republican. Democrats and Republicans have won every single presidential

105
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:05,760
election since the Civil War. In order to become president, you must become the nominee

106
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:11,960
for one of these parties. Step 3, have about 50% of the voters vote for you. Partisan politics

107
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:16,440
have become an epidemic. You could host the most clumsy and awkward campaign ever, and

108
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:20,560
about half the voters will still vote for you because you have a D or an R next to your

109
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:25,200
name. Weak candidates can use this to their advantage. Since 1980, the winning president

110
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:29,880
has almost always won with close to 50% of the popular vote. Sometimes they won with

111
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:34,840
less than 50%. And in order for a long shot like Trump to have any chance of becoming

112
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:39,840
president, he was going to have to rely on all of these steps. And he did it using memes.

113
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:51,280
Donald Trump started out as just another wealthy New York City businessman. So what

114
00:09:51,280 --> 00:09:55,760
made him different? Well, Trump just really liked to put his name on stuff. I mean, he

115
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:59,760
really liked to put his name on stuff. Trump made it clear from early on that his strategy

116
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:05,160
as a businessman was not to build luxury apartments, but to build himself into a brand. There actually

117
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:09,840
isn't that much separating a brand from a meme. They're functionally identical. Both

118
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:14,960
condensed big concepts into a single name or image. Brands are basically just corporate

119
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:19,660
memes. And it just so happens that Trump was in the perfect position to become a living

120
00:10:19,660 --> 00:10:24,440
meme. Trump is a verb meaning to defeat by doing better. Coincidentally, Trump's own

121
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:29,680
name succinctly represented the power, prestige, and dominance associated with a wealthy New

122
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:35,000
York businessman. In 1978, Trump commenced the construction of Trump Tower, a 58-story

123
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:39,800
luxury skyscraper in Manhattan. The location of Manhattan is important because Manhattan

124
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:44,640
is the financial and cultural center of New York City, the biggest city in North America.

125
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:48,640
Manhattan is home to globally renowned landmarks, Times Square, the Empire State Building, the

126
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:53,440
World Trade Centers, and now Trump Tower. Trump put his name on one of the biggest landmarks

127
00:10:53,440 --> 00:11:02,920
in the heart of New York City, leaving millions to wonder, who is this Trump fellow? In order

128
00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:07,760
for a meme to spread, it must first have a means of spreading. Today, basically every

129
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:11,720
meme gets spread through the internet. Everyone in our society is connected to the internet,

130
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:16,600
which makes it the fastest way for ideas and memes to spread. In the 1980s, mass media

131
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:20,520
was very different. Instead of the internet, almost all Americans got their information

132
00:11:20,520 --> 00:11:26,760
through network television. NBC, CBS, and ABC. And it just so happens that all three

133
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:31,560
of the major networks had headquarters located in Manhattan, just a few miles away from Trump

134
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:36,000
Tower. New York City was the center of mass media in the United States, and it would be

135
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:40,600
this media that would transform Trump from businessman to celebrity. Donald Trump, as

136
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:46,640
I say, is just 33 years old. He now has an apartment for sale in a new Trump building

137
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:51,160
called the Trump Tower. Starting around 1980, Donald Trump began to make appearances on

138
00:11:51,160 --> 00:11:57,600
national television. First it was just a few interviews. Then it was cameos. Donald Trump.

139
00:11:58,360 --> 00:12:04,280
Ads. Entire television programs centered around Donald Trump. From the perspective of the networks, they were just

140
00:12:04,280 --> 00:12:09,560
exploiting an easily available resource. Donald Trump was inherently interesting to the American

141
00:12:09,560 --> 00:12:14,480
public. Look at this right here on the street! It's Donald Trump! What are you, morons?

142
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:19,200
While most billionaire business tycoons try to avoid the spotlight, Trump reveled in it.

143
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:23,440
Americans just kept seeing this bold, confident man on their television sets over and over

144
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:28,480
again. The focus wasn't on who he was, but what he represented. You didn't have to know

145
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:33,760
anything about Trump to recognize that he was rich, tough, and successful, just by the

146
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:38,240
way he acted on television. Trump embodied the spirit of capitalism that was rampant

147
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:44,040
in the 80s, and many Americans admired and idolized him as a symbol of wealth and power.

148
00:12:44,040 --> 00:12:48,480
Trump stayed consistently relevant in the American public for 20 years after that. He

149
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:51,840
had truly become one of the most recognized men in America.

150
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:20,480
You know, that's his appeal to me.

151
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:56,480
Uh-oh! You frickin' moron! You just got di-

152
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:35,600
So by now in our story, Trump had completed the first step in becoming president, becoming well

153
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:40,840
recognized by the general public. Now he was ready to actually run for president, which he had to do

154
00:14:40,840 --> 00:14:45,960
as either a Democrat or a Republican in order to have any chance of winning. But which party would

155
00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:49,800
give him the best chance of winning? Trump's party affiliation history is actually quite

156
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:54,080
interesting, and few people are aware of it. Starting in the 80s, Trump was actually regarded

157
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:58,840
as a Democrat. In 1987, he registered as a Republican and remained that way for about a

158
00:14:58,840 --> 00:15:04,520
decade. Then in 1999, he joined the Independent Reform Party, where he tried to run for president.

159
00:15:04,520 --> 00:15:09,560
That's right, Trump actually launched an exploratory campaign for the 2000 presidential election,

160
00:15:09,560 --> 00:15:14,720
17 years before he became the most controversial political figure in the country. He ended up

161
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:18,760
dropping out before the primaries due to party infighting, but it's interesting nonetheless.

162
00:15:18,760 --> 00:15:24,240
Then starting in 2001, he was a Democrat again. You identify more as a Democrat or a Republican?

163
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:30,320
Well, you'd be shocked if I said that in many cases I probably identify more as a Democrat.

164
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:36,160
Until 2009, when he registered as a Republican again. Now, an average observer would look at

165
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:40,440
this data and call Trump a flip-clopper, a figurehead that can't make up his mind on

166
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:45,680
issues. But that's not how I see it. Something's up here, and it becomes apparent when you compare

167
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:50,400
Trump's party affiliation to the president's party through time. Trump's party position has

168
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:54,560
almost always been contrarian to the acting president, and I believe that this was an

169
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:59,520
intentional strategy. Trump appeared to be playing towards a theory in modern politics called the

170
00:15:59,520 --> 00:16:05,520
Political Pendulum, not since George Bush in 1992 has one party won the presidential election three

171
00:16:05,560 --> 00:16:11,080
times in a row. In fact, every president since then has been elected for two terms and then

172
00:16:11,080 --> 00:16:16,200
succeeded by a president of the opposing party. Trump was seemingly positioning his political

173
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:20,840
affiliation to give himself the greatest advantage if he were to consider running for president. So

174
00:16:20,840 --> 00:16:26,320
after Barack Obama was elected president in 2008, completing the Democratic Party trifecta of the

175
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:32,000
presidency, the Senate majority, and the House majority, Trump's choice became clear. He had

176
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:37,080
to run as a Republican, and this ultimately made the most sense for Trump and gave him the best

177
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:41,720
chance of winning. Trump was aging, and so were his admirers from the 80s. I've been now around

178
00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:45,680
long, you know, I think of myself as a young guy, but I'm not so young anymore. Older people tend

179
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:54,320
to vote Republican, so all Trump had to do was give them what they wanted. At this point, Trump

180
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:59,200
was well known by the public, and he had his political party. Now all he had left to do was

181
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:04,640
his biggest challenge yet, getting enough people to vote for him. The year is 2009, and the world

182
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:09,240
has become a very different place since Trump first entered the public eye. The once friendly

183
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:14,000
mainstream media had become politically charged and divided. The rise of the internet provided

184
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:19,640
humanity with a tremendous gift and a debilitating curse. Information was more accessible than ever,

185
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:25,240
yet truth seemed harder than ever to find. Americans have become more politicized, cynical,

186
00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:30,880
and distrustful than ever before. Celebrities now faced unprecedented scrutiny from the public,

187
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:36,640
with one slip-up having the potential of becoming national news. As you can see, Trump had quite the

188
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:41,680
uphill battle ahead of him, but luckily for him, one other thing had changed since the 80s. Memes!

189
00:17:41,680 --> 00:17:47,400
Thanks to the internet, memes now had more influence over people than ever before, and if

190
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:52,880
Trump knew one thing, it was how to make good memes. If you look back in recent history,

191
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:56,760
presidential legacies are remembered most fundamentally through memes.

192
00:17:56,760 --> 00:18:01,960
Because people have got to know whether or not their president's a crook. Well, I'm not a crook.

193
00:18:01,960 --> 00:18:11,800
Tear down this wall. Read my lips. I did not have sexual relations with that woman.

194
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:16,880
And we use these little memes from the past to judge their whole reputation in the present.

195
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:21,960
Two of the most fondly remembered presidents of the 20th century are Franklin Roosevelt and John F.

196
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:26,640
Kennedy, and unsurprisingly, they have been responsible for two of the most recognizable

197
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:37,600
quotations of all time. That the only thing we have to fear is fear itself. Ask not what your

198
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:44,200
country can do for you. Ask what you can do for your country. Both of these presidents were very

199
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:49,160
skilled communicators, so they broke their language down into memes to make their speeches

200
00:18:49,160 --> 00:18:55,080
more memorable and impactful. But FDR and JFK also had something else in common. In order for

201
00:18:55,080 --> 00:19:00,240
a meme to spread, it must have a means of spreading, and both of these presidents utilized

202
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:05,120
new methods of technology in order to spread their messages. FDR was the first president to

203
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:10,160
regularly address America using the radio, and for many Americans listening to FDR speak with

204
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:15,760
his own voice in their own homes established an unprecedented new connection between the president

205
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:20,200
and the public. There's a reason why FDR was the only president elected four times in a row.

206
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:25,600
Americans really trusted him, and much of that trust was built upon not the content, but the

207
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:31,840
means of his communication. Similarly, JFK became the first television president. During the 1960

208
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:36,160
election, a key turning point came during the first televised presidential debate in history

209
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:41,360
between JFK and Richard Nixon. Kennedy used the televised broadcast to his advantage, appearing

210
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:46,880
much more confident and photogenic than Nixon. 70 million Americans watched the debates, and most

211
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:51,400
of them left with the impression that Kennedy had won, momentum that Kennedy used to narrowly win

212
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:57,680
the election. Once again, the means of communication made the difference in the election. So just as

213
00:19:57,680 --> 00:20:03,920
FDR used the radio and JFK used the television, Donald Trump used Twitter to give himself an

214
00:20:03,920 --> 00:20:09,000
advantage over other candidates. That's right, Trump's Twitter. Donald Trump's Twitter is his

215
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:14,800
greatest weakness, but also his greatest strength. Donald Trump's Twitter opens him up to the most

216
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:20,480
tremendous amount of scrutiny that any presidential candidate has ever had to face. Trump's tweets are

217
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:26,800
unfiltered, uncensored, and unsubstantiated. Any controversial thing he says puts a big giant

218
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:32,640
glowing target on his back visible to the entire world. So considering all of this, how could Trump's

219
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:38,640
Twitter possibly give him an advantage? The answer is means. Twitter is an exceptional site for the

220
00:20:38,680 --> 00:20:44,520
spread of memes. The fundamental mechanics of Twitter as a social network facilitate the viral

221
00:20:44,520 --> 00:20:49,480
spread of information. In order for Trump to rebrand himself as a politician, he would have to use

222
00:20:49,480 --> 00:20:54,720
Twitter to spread his messages as efficiently as possible. Twitter would allow Trump to deliver

223
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:59,640
words from his brain directly to the American people. And there are two things that spread

224
00:20:59,640 --> 00:21:06,360
furthest on Twitter. Controversy and memes. Donald Trump was about to take the site by storm with

225
00:21:06,360 --> 00:21:22,760
some controversial memes. All of the pieces were in place for Trump to begin his presidential

226
00:21:22,760 --> 00:21:28,320
gambit. Trump had his audience, his direction, and his vehicle for a hostile takeover of American

227
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:33,720
politics. Now was the time for action. Nobody was prepared for what Trump was about to do. Maybe

228
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:37,960
that's why they were so shocked. Maybe that's why they were so mad. You had to be a little mad

229
00:21:37,960 --> 00:21:42,680
to realize what Trump was doing. Trump was about to rise to political power, and he was about to

230
00:21:42,680 --> 00:21:48,720
do so through the dark arts of weaponized memes. Only the dankest minds on the internet had

231
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:52,840
theorized their existence, but nobody thought that anyone in power would actually be mad enough to

232
00:21:52,840 --> 00:21:57,280
use them, much less a presidential candidate. Most people just see memes as harmless fun,

233
00:21:57,280 --> 00:22:01,860
and most of the time that's just what they are. But memes have a dark side. Just as they have the

234
00:22:01,860 --> 00:22:07,420
power to build people up, memes have the power to tear people down. Howard Dean was a guy who

235
00:22:07,420 --> 00:22:12,540
ran for president in 2004. He was a good candidate who was pretty much ahead of his time. Dean had

236
00:22:12,540 --> 00:22:17,220
pioneered the strategy of using the internet for grassroots fundraising. Dean used this strategy

237
00:22:17,220 --> 00:22:22,900
to become a clear Democratic frontrunner heading into the Iowa caucus, and then it all came crashing

238
00:22:23,820 --> 00:22:29,460
We're going to South Dakota, and Oregon, and Washington, and Michigan, and then we're going

239
00:22:29,460 --> 00:22:31,460
to Washington DC to take back the White House!

240
00:22:52,900 --> 00:23:17,540
This one soundbite, a tiny innocent slip-up. This was enough to destroy Howard Dean's entire

241
00:23:17,540 --> 00:23:22,260
campaign. All that preparation, all the years grinding and working his way up the political

242
00:23:22,500 --> 00:23:27,580
chain, all the strategizing, all of Dean's policies, his platform, his entire political

243
00:23:27,580 --> 00:23:34,060
agenda, none of it mattered. Howard Dean's campaign was completely destroyed by one little meme.

244
00:23:34,060 --> 00:23:40,500
Trump was well aware of the capacity for memes to destroy a candidate. He understood how the

245
00:23:40,500 --> 00:23:46,180
American media worked, being a subject of it for 30 years. He recognized their capacity to eviscerate

246
00:23:46,180 --> 00:23:51,460
the public image of any candidate, and he knew how to avoid that fate. Donald Trump was ready

247
00:23:51,460 --> 00:23:56,660
to become president, and here's how he did it. Now, the first order of business is to blame

248
00:23:56,660 --> 00:24:02,460
everything on the guy before me. We start in March 2011. Trump had previously teased a run for

249
00:24:02,460 --> 00:24:07,300
president in the 2012 election, but ultimately decided against it despite being one of the

250
00:24:07,300 --> 00:24:12,300
highest polling candidates. Trump decides to attack President Obama about the validity of

251
00:24:12,300 --> 00:24:16,500
his birth certificate. Beginning in July, Trump brings his political rantings to his Twitter

252
00:24:16,500 --> 00:24:20,940
account. Trump's comments are highly controversial and draw heavy media attention. Through this

253
00:24:20,940 --> 00:24:25,940
experience, Trump sacrifices his relatively clean public image to liberals and the political

254
00:24:25,940 --> 00:24:31,580
establishment while endearing himself to hardcore conservatives. Trump initiates his transition from

255
00:24:31,580 --> 00:24:37,700
celebrity to political figurehead. Trump continues his criticism of Obama in the 2012. During this

256
00:24:37,700 --> 00:24:42,780
year, he witnesses Mitt Romney run a squeaky clean campaign in which he keeps controversy to a bare

257
00:24:42,780 --> 00:24:48,060
minimum. Romney runs one of the most bland and cautious campaigns in recent history up until

258
00:24:48,060 --> 00:24:56,700
his infamous 47% comment. Over the course of the 2012 election, Trump would double down on his

259
00:24:56,700 --> 00:25:02,100
anti-Obama crusade, slamming the president on almost every opportunity. Trump didn't let up. He

260
00:25:02,100 --> 00:25:07,180
didn't let up for more than three years. Once again, this was all part of his transition from

261
00:25:07,180 --> 00:25:14,620
celebrity to politician. And on June 15, 2015, Donald Trump announced to the world that he was

262
00:25:14,620 --> 00:25:19,460
running for president. He spoke for over 45 minutes, but only two things stuck out. I will

263
00:25:19,460 --> 00:25:27,460
build a great, great wall on our southern border, and we are going to make our country great again.

264
00:25:27,460 --> 00:25:32,140
And as you would probably expect, no one took him seriously. Everyone laughed at him. The things

265
00:25:32,140 --> 00:25:38,020
Trump said were just so ridiculous and ridiculed he was. Trump got ridiculed in the news, ridiculed

266
00:25:38,020 --> 00:25:44,180
on talk shows, ridiculed on Facebook, Twitter, YouTube. Overnight, Trump became a national pariah.

267
00:25:44,420 --> 00:25:48,780
Many would have called Trump's debut a total disaster, but it wasn't. Donald Trump had actually

268
00:25:48,780 --> 00:25:54,260
made one of the greatest presidential debuts of all time. Why? Because it got people talking. On

269
00:25:54,260 --> 00:26:00,540
every news network across America, on your Twitter feed, on your Facebook feed, everyone was talking

270
00:26:00,540 --> 00:26:05,900
about Trump. They saw his big, bold logo. They questioned building a wall, and they debated

271
00:26:05,900 --> 00:26:11,420
making America great again. Through his debut, we can perfectly observe the duality of Trump's meme

272
00:26:11,460 --> 00:26:17,700
strategy. Offense and defense. Let's start with his first meme. Build a wall. It's offensive. It's

273
00:26:17,700 --> 00:26:23,460
controversial. Controversy leads to attention, and attention leads to a viral meme. And then we have

274
00:26:23,460 --> 00:26:28,740
the opposite kind of meme. Make America great again, which is perhaps the most effective

275
00:26:28,740 --> 00:26:35,020
campaign slogan of the 21st century. It's a meme that is inherently defensive. It relies on

276
00:26:35,020 --> 00:26:40,560
supporters rallying around it and spouting the same message to more and more people. These two

277
00:26:40,600 --> 00:26:45,000
memes were the building blocks of Trump's campaign. They gave him attention. They gave him

278
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:52,560
support. But most importantly, they gave him a clear direction. Politics are complicated. A lot

279
00:26:52,560 --> 00:26:58,000
of Americans get mad about politics, but very few Americans actually understand politics. Most

280
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:02,200
Americans just don't have the time to research politics. Some Americans are just too lazy, and

281
00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:07,360
some Americans are just too stupid. Many politicians struggle to communicate their platform

282
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:12,000
to anyone short of the most advanced observers, because their messages are just too complicated.

283
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:18,800
As a result, they're ignored and forgotten. Trump understood this. His solution was to use memes to

284
00:27:18,800 --> 00:27:25,360
communicate a simple message to as many people as possible, because after all, a meme is the fastest

285
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:31,120
way to put an idea in someone's head. Donald Trump began his celebrity status as a media darling. He

286
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:36,400
was about to become their worst enemy. For the next 18 months, Donald Trump would throttle the

287
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:42,120
media with an endless stream of controversial bits, quips, and memes. Because they asked me

288
00:27:42,120 --> 00:27:47,520
what I'd do, and I said, I'm gonna bomb the shit out of them. Look at my African-American over here.

289
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:53,200
And I watch our police and our firemen down in 7-Eleven, down at the World Trade Center. Autism

290
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:59,240
has become an epidemic. Every news channel in America essentially became Trump TV. The media

291
00:27:59,240 --> 00:28:04,320
wanted desperately to tear him down, just as they had done with Mitt Romney and Howard Dean. But

292
00:28:04,360 --> 00:28:09,920
Trump was different. Both Romney and Dean had a single controversial moment that drew all of the

293
00:28:09,920 --> 00:28:15,560
media's focus. Trump gave the media a new controversial moment every week. The media

294
00:28:15,560 --> 00:28:20,480
couldn't fixate itself on a single problem, and the problems just sort of faded into the background.

295
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:25,720
The only common denominator was Donald Trump's name, and Donald Trump would milk the media for

296
00:28:25,720 --> 00:28:31,200
five billion dollars worth of free publicity. Furthermore, by baiting the media to focus on

297
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:37,680
petty, self-made controversy, Trump overshadowed his most glaring weakness, his total lack of

298
00:28:37,680 --> 00:28:45,200
political expertise. NBC, CNN, and even Fox News were all trying to destroy him, but little did

299
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:50,000
they know they were actually playing right into Trump's advantage and spreading his memes further

300
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:55,680
than campaign advertising ever could. There was no turning back. Trump was sacrificing his entire

301
00:28:55,680 --> 00:29:01,840
public image, his whole legacy, for a shot at becoming president. Trump was all-in, and the

302
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:12,520
media called his bluff. Game on! In order to become president, Trump had to first become the Republican

303
00:29:12,520 --> 00:29:18,080
Party nominee. He entered a field with 16 other Republican candidates, the largest field of any

304
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:22,920
party in American history. You'd think that this would provide Trump with a huge struggle, but once

305
00:29:22,920 --> 00:29:28,400
again, it actually played into his advantage. Thanks to the extremely disproportionate amount

306
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:33,800
of media coverage on Trump in both news broadcasts and televised debates, Americans viewed the whole

307
00:29:33,800 --> 00:29:39,640
Republican primary process as Trump versus the field. Even though the other candidates were real

308
00:29:39,640 --> 00:29:44,840
politicians with real political experience, they simply couldn't get their brands out there to the

309
00:29:44,840 --> 00:29:50,000
people because Trump soaked up everyone's attention. Since there were so many Republican

310
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:55,640
candidates starving to share airtime with Trump, no one could get adequate coverage. They all just

311
00:29:55,640 --> 00:30:00,720
kind of tripped over each other. And heading into the Republican debates, only a few candidates even

312
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:05,760
posed a threat to Trump. And if you thought that these veteran politicians would humiliate Trump

313
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:11,520
in a real political debate, then you'd be wrong again. Trump shut down all of them with simple

314
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:18,200
name-calling. But not just any name-calling, Trump eliminated his competition with weaponized memes.

315
00:30:18,320 --> 00:30:22,560
The weakest person on the stage by far is Jeb Bush.

316
00:30:22,560 --> 00:30:26,080
And we don't need a weak person being president of the United States, okay?

317
00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:28,200
You're gonna have to get out there yourself, Jeb.

318
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:32,360
Weak. Weak, pathetic people. Low energy is a better term.

319
00:30:32,360 --> 00:30:35,800
Don't worry about it, little Marco. Little Marco, little Marco.

320
00:30:35,800 --> 00:30:42,600
Now you look at Kasich, I have never seen a human being eat in such a disgusting fashion.

321
00:30:42,600 --> 00:30:46,920
It's disgusting. Do you want that for your president? I don't think so.

322
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:51,080
But it's not what you said in the op-ed. Breathe, breathe, breathe.

323
00:30:51,080 --> 00:30:56,920
Lyin' Ted, I call him Lyin' Ted. He holds up the Bible and then he puts it down and he lies, okay? Lyin' Ted.

324
00:30:56,920 --> 00:31:02,440
You may think that this is completely ridiculous, and that childish name-calling could never supplant

325
00:31:02,440 --> 00:31:06,760
real political argumentation, but the results speak for themselves.

326
00:31:06,760 --> 00:31:13,960
You've called women you don't like fat pigs, dogs, slobs, and disgusting animals.

327
00:31:13,960 --> 00:31:16,200
Your Twitter account. Only Rosie O'Donnell.

328
00:31:18,120 --> 00:31:19,000
I know it wasn't.

329
00:31:23,880 --> 00:31:29,480
The Iowa caucuses took place on February 1st, 2016. Even at this early point in the race,

330
00:31:29,480 --> 00:31:33,400
five candidates already dropped out because they couldn't gain any sort of traction

331
00:31:33,400 --> 00:31:37,080
over the oversaturated field. And in the Iowa caucuses,

332
00:31:37,080 --> 00:31:42,280
Donald Trump earned more votes than all but one candidate. This wasn't a joke anymore.

333
00:31:42,280 --> 00:31:48,120
This was for real. These votes counted. The voters were validating Trump as a serious candidate.

334
00:31:48,120 --> 00:31:53,160
His strategies were working. After the caucuses, three more candidates withdrew from the race.

335
00:31:53,160 --> 00:31:58,040
On February 9th, Trump won the New Hampshire primary. Three more candidates withdrew.

336
00:31:58,040 --> 00:32:03,320
On the 20th, Trump won South Carolina. He was now the clear front-runner in the race.

337
00:32:03,320 --> 00:32:08,760
Jeb Bush, who many political pundits viewed as an early favorite, dropped out of the race

338
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:14,600
after just three states elections. By mid-March, just two other candidates remained. And on May 3rd,

339
00:32:14,600 --> 00:32:20,440
Ted Cruz dropped out of the race, leaving Donald Trump as the presumptive Republican nominee.

340
00:32:20,440 --> 00:32:25,880
Trump didn't just defeat his opponents. He crushed them. Donald Trump won the nomination

341
00:32:25,880 --> 00:32:30,600
with the largest margin of victory in the history of the Republican primaries.

342
00:32:30,600 --> 00:32:35,880
He took a struggling and divided party and united it under a single platform.

343
00:32:35,880 --> 00:32:42,600
Donald Trump was THE Republican candidate, and he had just one more challenge separating him from the presidency.

344
00:32:42,600 --> 00:32:49,240
You guys know the story after this. What followed was one of those brutal and divisive elections in American history.

345
00:32:49,240 --> 00:32:56,120
Both candidates engaged in what was essentially meme warfare. Clinton's email servers versus Trump's pussy grab.

346
00:32:56,120 --> 00:33:01,400
Racist Donald versus Crooked Hillary. Legend has it that at some point the candidates talked about

347
00:33:01,400 --> 00:33:06,840
actual political issues, but historians still dispute this. Anyway, at the end of the day Trump

348
00:33:06,840 --> 00:33:11,960
had better memes than Hillary. Make America Great Again is just so much more of an impactful

349
00:33:11,960 --> 00:33:18,680
campaign slogan than Hillary's. What was hers again? Love Trump's hate? It literally has Trump's name in it.

350
00:33:18,680 --> 00:33:27,320
That can't be right. Maybe it was America is great because America is good. The hell does that even mean?

351
00:33:27,320 --> 00:33:35,080
Oh, I got it. Her real campaign slogan was Pokemon go to the polls. On November 8th, 2016,

352
00:33:35,080 --> 00:33:41,400
Americans Pokemon went to the polls and elected Donald Trump President of the United States.

353
00:33:41,400 --> 00:33:46,760
And you can complain all you want about it. You can call the system rigged. You can say he cheated.

354
00:33:46,760 --> 00:33:52,280
You can riot in the streets. You can call everyone who voted for Trump a racist, sexist, homophobic,

355
00:33:52,280 --> 00:33:57,560
transphobic moron. You can do whatever you want, but it won't change the fact that Donald Trump,

356
00:33:57,560 --> 00:34:03,480
a man with no formal political experience, used memes to get elected to the most powerful

357
00:34:03,480 --> 00:34:08,760
political office in the world. And sure, he might have trashed the rest of America to do it,

358
00:34:08,760 --> 00:34:12,360
but you know what they say, the end justifies the memes.

359
00:34:15,240 --> 00:34:18,760
This sounds like political presidential talk to me and I know people have talked to you about

360
00:34:18,760 --> 00:34:21,720
whether or not you want to run. You've said though that if you did run for president you

361
00:34:21,720 --> 00:34:25,720
believe you'd win. Well, I don't know. I think I'd win. I tell you what, I wouldn't go in to lose.

362
00:34:25,720 --> 00:34:34,040
But hey, that's just a theory. A meme theory. Thanks for unsubscribing.

363
00:34:51,720 --> 00:35:04,040
Thank you.
