00:00:07,760 --> 00:00:11,680
Fruit of the Loom is an American clothing manufacturer most well known for selling

3
00:00:11,680 --> 00:00:16,720
underwear. Most people recognize the brand for their colorful logo which has nothing to do with

4
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:21,360
underwear. In the middle is a big red apple surrounded by three different colored grapes

5
00:00:21,360 --> 00:00:26,640
and dark green leaves. According to official sources that's all there is to the Fruit of

6
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:31,120
the Loom logo, but many people will claim that this version is missing something.

7
00:00:34,720 --> 00:00:40,000
One of the strangest topics of obscure online lore is the discrepancy over whether the Fruit

8
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:45,680
of the Loom logo ever contained a cornucopia. It's an example of the Mandela Effect,

9
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:50,160
a phenomenon where many people's memories do not match up with reality.

10
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:54,720
Many examples of the Mandela Effect can be chalked up to common misconceptions.

11
00:00:54,720 --> 00:01:00,400
The often cited Berenstain Bears is most likely misremembered due to how common the suffix steen

12
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:06,560
is in proper names. People misspell Looney Tunes because of how they're used to spelling cartoon.

13
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:09,920
People misspell Fruit Loops because of how they're used to spelling fruit.

14
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:16,080
A lot of these erroneous memories are created out of a company stylizing a certain word in a logo

15
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:21,120
and our brains auto-correcting it to a more conventional version. Anyone who has ever

16
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:25,520
studied for a history exam can tell you that we can't always count on our memory.

17
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:31,040
We utilize a combination of schemas and heuristics to efficiently process information.

18
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:36,720
These cognitive techniques give us speed at the cost of accuracy. They allow us to read scrambled

19
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:42,320
words like these but sometimes they cause us to miss information hiding in plain sight. On my

20
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:47,840
Dale Earnhardt video I missed this typo despite reviewing it nearly a hundred times in editing.

21
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:52,160
Sometimes our minds play tricks on us and we see things that aren't really there.

22
00:01:53,200 --> 00:02:00,400
This is the construct. Most psychologists believe that memory is a reconstructive process.

23
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:05,120
We recall information not through identical snapshots of events but by piecing together

24
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:10,160
a scene through a series of key details. Reconstruction prevents memories from being

25
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:16,320
100% faithful to reality. No one can pay attention to all the minutia of an event.

26
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:21,760
So beyond a certain point of specificity certain details will be left out rendering our memories

27
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:26,960
forever incomplete. In addition to this reconstruction may be influenced by several

28
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:33,200
other cognitive processes resulting in distortions. Sometimes people may reconstruct a single memory

29
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:38,320
out of multiple separate but similar events. This is likely the reason behind some people

30
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:45,920
remembering the mythical Sinbad Genie movie Shazam. In 1996 Shaq starred in a movie called Kazaam

31
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:51,920
two years after a Sinbad TV airing in which he dressed like a genie. The Lost Sinbad movie was

32
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:58,160
simply the result of people conflating these similar events. There was no Jiffy Peanut Butter

33
00:02:58,160 --> 00:03:05,040
only Jiff and Skippy. When recalling information we tend to either miss details or mix up details

34
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:10,960
with something else very similar. What is far more unusual is recalling a unique detail that

35
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:16,560
supposedly never existed. The Fruit of the Loom discrepancy implies that numerous people are

36
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:22,320
falsely inserting an extraneous object into the recollection of the logo. This isn't the same as

37
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:28,080
people misremembering a monocle on the Monopoly Man. Caricatures of wealthy aristocrats are often

38
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:33,120
depicted with a top hat and monocle so it's entirely plausible that people would project

39
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:38,720
the image of a monocle onto their memories of Mr Monopoly. Ultimately the error is nothing more

40
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:43,680
than adding a small circle and line to a monochromatic drawing. With the Fruit of the Loom

41
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:49,280
logo people are supposedly mistaken and envisioning a distinct brown object unlike anything else in

42
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:54,960
the frame. A cornucopia also known as a horn of plenty is not exactly a common object.

43
00:03:55,520 --> 00:04:02,000
wordcount.org ranks the term cornucopia around the 42,000th most common word in the English language.

44
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:06,640
I'd imagine that for most of you watching it's a word that only crosses your mind maybe once

45
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:12,640
per year. Even on the rare occasion that someone does encounter the term its most common present

46
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:17,920
day use is the figurative sense meaning abundance or the term used to describe the place with all

47
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:23,120
the weapons in the Hunger Games. The physical object the word is referring to serves the very

48
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:28,640
niche purpose of a decorative autumn accessory. Cornucopias are most frequently depicted among

49
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:34,240
fruits and vegetables common to the fall harvest. This includes apples and grapes but more often

50
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:39,920
features pumpkins squash corn and sunflowers crops you'd expect to see around Thanksgiving

51
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:45,760
time. For most of us the sight of a cornucopia will evoke a color palette of gold brown and orange

52
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:51,040
consistent with the changing vegetation of autumn. These colors are mostly absent from the Fruit of

53
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:56,320
the Loom logo so it's somewhat far-fetched to infer that this image would naturally prime people

54
00:04:56,320 --> 00:05:01,760
to think of a cornucopia. If that were the case then wouldn't people be mistaking a cornucopia

55
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:07,600
out of any logo with a pile of fruit? To make matters more bizarre many who claim to remember

56
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:12,880
the cornucopia mentioned that they first learned about the object from the Fruit of the Loom logo.

57
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:17,600
Some recall specific conversations with their parents in which they mistook the object for a

58
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:23,280
seashell or a bugle chip. Others distinctly remember mistakenly referring to the cornucopia

59
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:28,800
as the loom which is another term most young children haven't learned yet. It's much harder

60
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:33,680
to dismiss this version of the logo as a fabrication when so many corresponding memories

61
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:40,800
exist. Most people claim the cornucopia logo existed in the 1990s and early 2000s although

62
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:48,240
some recall a cornucopia as far back as the 60s and 70s. In 1973 jazz musician Frank West released

63
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:53,280
a parody of the underwear brand whose album cover referenced the shape of a cornucopia.

64
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:58,640
In 2006 the film Ant Bully depicted a pair of underwear clearly based on the Fruit of the Loom

65
00:05:58,640 --> 00:06:04,800
brand which also features a cornucopia. In the 2012 South Park episode about zip lining

66
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:09,280
Cartman's underwear portrayed an additional reference to Fruit of the Loom which once

67
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:14,480
again depicts a cornucopia. These are three different kinds of media from three different

68
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:19,200
decades all portraying the same object in reference to Fruit of the Loom's logo.

69
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:24,960
Additional references to the cornucopia can be found in various print sources across the time

70
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:31,040
span. However in stark contrast to the abundance of personal testimony and secondary sources

71
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:36,640
regarding the logo physical evidence of the cornucopia's existence has proven hard to come by.

72
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:41,440
Over the years Fruit of the Loom has sold conceivably millions of products

73
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:46,800
so how is it that hardly anyone has been able to produce even a single example of the cornucopia

74
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:51,920
existing on old clothing? Solving the paradox is seemingly as easy as reaching into your

75
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:57,040
old underwear drawer and finding a pair with a design. So why can't anyone seem to do it?

76
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:08,720
Vintage Fruit of the Loom ads aren't much better at helping us find the cornucopia.

77
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:13,520
Many followers of the theory like to point to this canceled trademark filed by the U.S.

78
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:19,360
patent database as evidence. However the legal code cited in the paperwork is liberally applied

79
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:25,360
to any trademark with a pile of fruit so we can't assume this is significant for Fruit of the Loom.

80
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:30,720
Company representatives continue to deny that any trace of a cornucopia ever existed

81
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:35,120
leaving many ardent supporters of the elusive logo utterly baffled.

82
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:40,320
The result is one of the most mysterious and widespread misconceptions of our time.

83
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:45,520
It's a dilemma that makes no sense for either side. Why would so many people erroneously

84
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:51,440
believe that such a visually distinct object once existed in the logo and why would Fruit of the Loom

85
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:56,560
have any reason to instigate a mass cover-up? This was something people all around the world

86
00:07:56,560 --> 00:08:01,520
would see every time they pulled down their pants to use the toilet. How could it result in this

87
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:07,200
much confusion? Well going back to previous examples one explanation for the discrepancy

88
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:11,120
would be that people are simply confusing the Fruit of the Loom logo with some other

89
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:17,120
prominent logo featuring a cornucopia. Browsing the U.S. trademark registry reveals several other

90
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:22,400
similar logo designs but none belonging to brands prominent enough to reasonably create such a

91
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:27,680
widespread dispute. Some like to point to the brown leaves of a previous logo iteration and

92
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:32,320
claim that people have confused that for the cornucopia. While the shape and formation of

93
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:37,520
the leaves is not at all like the supposed cornucopia design it is somewhat plausible

94
00:08:37,520 --> 00:08:42,880
that on very small print versions of the tag some people may have mixed up the two. Another

95
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:48,000
explanation could be that the cornucopia version of the logo was only printed on knockoff versions

96
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:53,360
of the main brand. Knockoffs are common for virtually any brand of apparel but Fruit of the

97
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:59,120
Loom typically marketed itself as an inexpensive consumer product so it seems unlikely that a

98
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:03,600
generic clone could claim enough of the market share to fool so many people about the true

99
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:09,840
appearance of the logo. It's possible that the cornucopia logo only existed as a seasonal variant

100
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:14,800
or as part of a special collection. This could explain why people can only find the standard

101
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:21,120
fruit version. Maybe the cornucopia only existed on some tags of Fruit of the Loom products rather

102
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:26,960
than serving as the official logo. Either way these explanations don't help us justify why

103
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:32,640
physical versions of the cornucopia don't seem to exist. More radical theories point to the idea

104
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:38,240
of parallel universes and timeline swapping. The possibility that our consciousness was seamlessly

105
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:43,520
transferred to a totally separate but equally plausible reality. A reality where everything

106
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:48,720
is identical except for a few cosmetic differences between brand names and an undiscovered Sinbad

107
00:09:48,720 --> 00:10:02,720
movie. At the end of the day does it really matter whether or not the Fruit of the Loom logo has a

108
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:08,800
cornucopia or whether Kate Kat has a hyphen or whether the tip of Pikachu's tail is black?

109
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:15,120
The Mandela effect is largely a manifestation of the mundane. Information which is not salient

110
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:20,480
enough for us to pay close attention. Everyone in America has probably seen the face of a penny

111
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:25,920
over a thousand times but how many of us can accurately recreate all of its components from

112
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:31,280
memory? The fact of the matter is that the face of a penny is not relevant to how we understand

113
00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:37,520
it as an object. There's no disputing who was president in 1985 or what the score was before

114
00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:43,360
the Atlanta Falcons choked in Super Bowl 51. We tend to remember whatever we find important,

115
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:48,560
fascinating or unique and oftentimes your underwear tag doesn't quite fall into that

116
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:55,120
category. Sometimes it's easier to imagine that reality itself has been distorted than confront

117
00:10:55,120 --> 00:11:00,400
the idea that our memory on an everyday level is quite fallible. Memory is one of our only

118
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:05,760
connections with the past. In many ways how we remember the world makes up the essence of who

119
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:11,600
we are as a person. We go about our lives under the assumption that what we remember is entirely

120
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:17,680
accurate and it's terrifying to consider that our assessment of reality may only be tenuous at best.

121
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:24,560
Ultimately memory is a lot like underwear. We use it every day, it's necessary for our daily lives

122
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:29,520
and we always have it on unless we're very intoxicated. We don't tend to think about it

123
00:11:29,520 --> 00:11:35,920
very much because it seems so straightforward and reliable. Unfortunately both memory and underwear

124
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:40,960
are doomed to wind up permanently stained with something we don't quite understand.

125
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:47,360
A cornucopia much like a memory is a relic of a bygone time, a token of the past that will forever

126
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:53,600
remain frustratingly out of reach. At least now you can appreciate being in the now. The present

127
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:59,200
makes up a tiny fraction of our lives compared to the past and future but it's the only time frame

128
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:05,200
we will ever truly know. We live in an unprecedented era when we are no longer encumbered by the

129
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:10,960
imperfections of memory alone. Almost everybody on earth now has the ability to capture a moment

130
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:17,120
in time with as much detail as you can fit on an HD display. Thanks to the technology of the future

131
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:22,560
our connection with the past has never been stronger. So be sure to preserve the past by

132
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:28,560
taking plenty of photos and videos in the present. Enjoy the now, even the mundane details because

133
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:41,920
you never know just how suddenly things can change.

134
00:12:41,920 --> 00:13:00,400
Oh hey, how nice of you to stop by. I was just getting ready to chow down on another delicious

135
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:06,240
Thanksgiving feast. So Rusty, do you remember a cornucopia in the Fruit of the Loom logo?

136
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:13,520
Do I ever? Of course I do. No, of course I don't. Why would there be a cornucopia in the Fruit of

137
00:13:13,520 --> 00:13:19,440
the Loom logo? It doesn't make any sense. Is Fruit of the Loom supposed to be a Thanksgiving-based

138
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:27,200
underwear company? Is this all part of the Mandela Effect? The whole thing, did Mandela die or was he

139
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:32,800
just in prison for a long time? Can you imagine how disrespectful or how disrespectful it is?

140
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:36,240
Not can you even imagine. It definitely is. Is the man dead or is he still alive?

141
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:44,880
I mean, all right, it's very effing stupid that people are confusing movies that

142
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:52,480
include huge stars. Like, all right, did Kazaam actually have a movie about a genie starring

143
00:13:52,480 --> 00:14:01,760
Shaquille O'Neal or was it Shazam with a largely forgotten actor Sinbad? Of course it was Kazaam

144
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:07,200
with Shaquille O'Neal, the movie that everyone remembers if you're older than 20 years old.

145
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:13,200
Oh boy, sounds like yet another classic Thanksgiving dinner table rant.

146
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:17,520
It's a good thing I have these noise-isolating Raycon earbuds.

147
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:28,080
If you're looking for a great gift this holiday season, you should pick up a pair of Raycon

148
00:14:28,080 --> 00:14:33,920
Everyday E25s. Starting at just half the price of other premium brands, Raycon earbuds offer

149
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:39,440
