00:07.760 --> 00:11.680
Fruit of the Loom is an American clothing manufacturer most well known for selling

00:11.680 --> 00:16.720
underwear. Most people recognize the brand for their colorful logo which has nothing to do with

00:16.720 --> 00:21.360
underwear. In the middle is a big red apple surrounded by three different colored grapes

00:21.360 --> 00:26.640
and dark green leaves. According to official sources that's all there is to the Fruit of

00:26.640 --> 00:31.120
the Loom logo, but many people will claim that this version is missing something.

00:34.720 --> 00:40.000
One of the strangest topics of obscure online lore is the discrepancy over whether the Fruit

00:40.000 --> 00:45.680
of the Loom logo ever contained a cornucopia. It's an example of the Mandela Effect,

00:45.680 --> 00:50.160
a phenomenon where many people's memories do not match up with reality.

00:50.160 --> 00:54.720
Many examples of the Mandela Effect can be chalked up to common misconceptions.

00:54.720 --> 01:00.400
The often cited Berenstain Bears is most likely misremembered due to how common the suffix steen

01:00.400 --> 01:06.560
is in proper names. People misspell Looney Tunes because of how they're used to spelling cartoon.

01:06.560 --> 01:09.920
People misspell Fruit Loops because of how they're used to spelling fruit.

01:10.560 --> 01:16.080
A lot of these erroneous memories are created out of a company stylizing a certain word in a logo

01:16.080 --> 01:21.120
and our brains auto-correcting it to a more conventional version. Anyone who has ever

01:21.120 --> 01:25.520
studied for a history exam can tell you that we can't always count on our memory.

01:25.520 --> 01:31.040
We utilize a combination of schemas and heuristics to efficiently process information.

01:31.040 --> 01:36.720
These cognitive techniques give us speed at the cost of accuracy. They allow us to read scrambled

01:36.720 --> 01:42.320
words like these but sometimes they cause us to miss information hiding in plain sight. On my

01:42.320 --> 01:47.840
Dale Earnhardt video I missed this typo despite reviewing it nearly a hundred times in editing.

01:47.840 --> 01:52.160
Sometimes our minds play tricks on us and we see things that aren't really there.

01:53.200 --> 02:00.400
This is the construct. Most psychologists believe that memory is a reconstructive process.

02:00.400 --> 02:05.120
We recall information not through identical snapshots of events but by piecing together

02:05.120 --> 02:10.160
a scene through a series of key details. Reconstruction prevents memories from being

02:10.160 --> 02:16.320
100% faithful to reality. No one can pay attention to all the minutia of an event.

02:16.320 --> 02:21.760
So beyond a certain point of specificity certain details will be left out rendering our memories

02:21.760 --> 02:26.960
forever incomplete. In addition to this reconstruction may be influenced by several

02:26.960 --> 02:33.200
other cognitive processes resulting in distortions. Sometimes people may reconstruct a single memory

02:33.200 --> 02:38.320
out of multiple separate but similar events. This is likely the reason behind some people

02:38.320 --> 02:45.920
remembering the mythical Sinbad Genie movie Shazam. In 1996 Shaq starred in a movie called Kazaam

02:45.920 --> 02:51.920
two years after a Sinbad TV airing in which he dressed like a genie. The Lost Sinbad movie was

02:51.920 --> 02:58.160
simply the result of people conflating these similar events. There was no Jiffy Peanut Butter

02:58.160 --> 03:05.040
only Jiff and Skippy. When recalling information we tend to either miss details or mix up details

03:05.040 --> 03:10.960
with something else very similar. What is far more unusual is recalling a unique detail that

03:10.960 --> 03:16.560
supposedly never existed. The Fruit of the Loom discrepancy implies that numerous people are

03:16.560 --> 03:22.320
falsely inserting an extraneous object into the recollection of the logo. This isn't the same as

03:22.320 --> 03:28.080
people misremembering a monocle on the Monopoly Man. Caricatures of wealthy aristocrats are often

03:28.080 --> 03:33.120
depicted with a top hat and monocle so it's entirely plausible that people would project

03:33.120 --> 03:38.720
the image of a monocle onto their memories of Mr Monopoly. Ultimately the error is nothing more

03:38.720 --> 03:43.680
than adding a small circle and line to a monochromatic drawing. With the Fruit of the Loom

03:43.680 --> 03:49.280
logo people are supposedly mistaken and envisioning a distinct brown object unlike anything else in

03:49.280 --> 03:54.960
the frame. A cornucopia also known as a horn of plenty is not exactly a common object.

03:55.520 --> 04:02.000
wordcount.org ranks the term cornucopia around the 42,000th most common word in the English language.

04:02.000 --> 04:06.640
I'd imagine that for most of you watching it's a word that only crosses your mind maybe once

04:06.640 --> 04:12.640
per year. Even on the rare occasion that someone does encounter the term its most common present

04:12.640 --> 04:17.920
day use is the figurative sense meaning abundance or the term used to describe the place with all

04:17.920 --> 04:23.120
the weapons in the Hunger Games. The physical object the word is referring to serves the very

04:23.120 --> 04:28.640
niche purpose of a decorative autumn accessory. Cornucopias are most frequently depicted among

04:28.640 --> 04:34.240
fruits and vegetables common to the fall harvest. This includes apples and grapes but more often

04:34.240 --> 04:39.920
features pumpkins squash corn and sunflowers crops you'd expect to see around Thanksgiving

04:39.920 --> 04:45.760
time. For most of us the sight of a cornucopia will evoke a color palette of gold brown and orange

04:45.760 --> 04:51.040
consistent with the changing vegetation of autumn. These colors are mostly absent from the Fruit of

04:51.040 --> 04:56.320
the Loom logo so it's somewhat far-fetched to infer that this image would naturally prime people

04:56.320 --> 05:01.760
to think of a cornucopia. If that were the case then wouldn't people be mistaking a cornucopia

05:01.760 --> 05:07.600
out of any logo with a pile of fruit? To make matters more bizarre many who claim to remember

05:07.600 --> 05:12.880
the cornucopia mentioned that they first learned about the object from the Fruit of the Loom logo.

05:12.880 --> 05:17.600
Some recall specific conversations with their parents in which they mistook the object for a

05:17.600 --> 05:23.280
seashell or a bugle chip. Others distinctly remember mistakenly referring to the cornucopia

05:23.280 --> 05:28.800
as the loom which is another term most young children haven't learned yet. It's much harder

05:28.800 --> 05:33.680
to dismiss this version of the logo as a fabrication when so many corresponding memories

05:33.680 --> 05:40.800
exist. Most people claim the cornucopia logo existed in the 1990s and early 2000s although

05:40.800 --> 05:48.240
some recall a cornucopia as far back as the 60s and 70s. In 1973 jazz musician Frank West released

05:48.240 --> 05:53.280
a parody of the underwear brand whose album cover referenced the shape of a cornucopia.

05:53.280 --> 05:58.640
In 2006 the film Ant Bully depicted a pair of underwear clearly based on the Fruit of the Loom

05:58.640 --> 06:04.800
brand which also features a cornucopia. In the 2012 South Park episode about zip lining

06:04.800 --> 06:09.280
Cartman's underwear portrayed an additional reference to Fruit of the Loom which once

06:09.280 --> 06:14.480
again depicts a cornucopia. These are three different kinds of media from three different

06:14.480 --> 06:19.200
decades all portraying the same object in reference to Fruit of the Loom's logo.

06:19.920 --> 06:24.960
Additional references to the cornucopia can be found in various print sources across the time

06:24.960 --> 06:31.040
span. However in stark contrast to the abundance of personal testimony and secondary sources

06:31.040 --> 06:36.640
regarding the logo physical evidence of the cornucopia's existence has proven hard to come by.

06:37.200 --> 06:41.440
Over the years Fruit of the Loom has sold conceivably millions of products

06:41.440 --> 06:46.800
so how is it that hardly anyone has been able to produce even a single example of the cornucopia

06:46.800 --> 06:51.920
existing on old clothing? Solving the paradox is seemingly as easy as reaching into your

06:51.920 --> 06:57.040
old underwear drawer and finding a pair with a design. So why can't anyone seem to do it?

07:04.320 --> 07:08.720
Vintage Fruit of the Loom ads aren't much better at helping us find the cornucopia.

07:08.720 --> 07:13.520
Many followers of the theory like to point to this canceled trademark filed by the U.S.

07:13.520 --> 07:19.360
patent database as evidence. However the legal code cited in the paperwork is liberally applied

07:19.360 --> 07:25.360
to any trademark with a pile of fruit so we can't assume this is significant for Fruit of the Loom.

07:25.360 --> 07:30.720
Company representatives continue to deny that any trace of a cornucopia ever existed

07:30.720 --> 07:35.120
leaving many ardent supporters of the elusive logo utterly baffled.

07:35.120 --> 07:40.320
The result is one of the most mysterious and widespread misconceptions of our time.

07:40.320 --> 07:45.520
It's a dilemma that makes no sense for either side. Why would so many people erroneously

07:45.520 --> 07:51.440
believe that such a visually distinct object once existed in the logo and why would Fruit of the Loom

07:51.440 --> 07:56.560
have any reason to instigate a mass cover-up? This was something people all around the world

07:56.560 --> 08:01.520
would see every time they pulled down their pants to use the toilet. How could it result in this

08:01.520 --> 08:07.200
much confusion? Well going back to previous examples one explanation for the discrepancy

08:07.200 --> 08:11.120
would be that people are simply confusing the Fruit of the Loom logo with some other

08:11.120 --> 08:17.120
prominent logo featuring a cornucopia. Browsing the U.S. trademark registry reveals several other

08:17.120 --> 08:22.400
similar logo designs but none belonging to brands prominent enough to reasonably create such a

08:22.400 --> 08:27.680
widespread dispute. Some like to point to the brown leaves of a previous logo iteration and

08:27.680 --> 08:32.320
claim that people have confused that for the cornucopia. While the shape and formation of

08:32.320 --> 08:37.520
the leaves is not at all like the supposed cornucopia design it is somewhat plausible

08:37.520 --> 08:42.880
that on very small print versions of the tag some people may have mixed up the two. Another

08:42.880 --> 08:48.000
explanation could be that the cornucopia version of the logo was only printed on knockoff versions

08:48.000 --> 08:53.360
of the main brand. Knockoffs are common for virtually any brand of apparel but Fruit of the

08:53.360 --> 08:59.120
Loom typically marketed itself as an inexpensive consumer product so it seems unlikely that a

08:59.120 --> 09:03.600
generic clone could claim enough of the market share to fool so many people about the true

09:03.600 --> 09:09.840
appearance of the logo. It's possible that the cornucopia logo only existed as a seasonal variant

09:09.840 --> 09:14.800
or as part of a special collection. This could explain why people can only find the standard

09:14.800 --> 09:21.120
fruit version. Maybe the cornucopia only existed on some tags of Fruit of the Loom products rather

09:21.120 --> 09:26.960
than serving as the official logo. Either way these explanations don't help us justify why

09:26.960 --> 09:32.640
physical versions of the cornucopia don't seem to exist. More radical theories point to the idea

09:32.640 --> 09:38.240
of parallel universes and timeline swapping. The possibility that our consciousness was seamlessly

09:38.240 --> 09:43.520
transferred to a totally separate but equally plausible reality. A reality where everything

09:43.520 --> 09:48.720
is identical except for a few cosmetic differences between brand names and an undiscovered Sinbad

09:48.720 --> 10:02.720
movie. At the end of the day does it really matter whether or not the Fruit of the Loom logo has a

10:02.720 --> 10:08.800
cornucopia or whether Kate Kat has a hyphen or whether the tip of Pikachu's tail is black?

10:08.800 --> 10:15.120
The Mandela effect is largely a manifestation of the mundane. Information which is not salient

10:15.120 --> 10:20.480
enough for us to pay close attention. Everyone in America has probably seen the face of a penny

10:20.480 --> 10:25.920
over a thousand times but how many of us can accurately recreate all of its components from

10:25.920 --> 10:31.280
memory? The fact of the matter is that the face of a penny is not relevant to how we understand

10:31.280 --> 10:37.520
it as an object. There's no disputing who was president in 1985 or what the score was before

10:37.520 --> 10:43.360
the Atlanta Falcons choked in Super Bowl 51. We tend to remember whatever we find important,

10:43.360 --> 10:48.560
fascinating or unique and oftentimes your underwear tag doesn't quite fall into that

10:48.560 --> 10:55.120
category. Sometimes it's easier to imagine that reality itself has been distorted than confront

10:55.120 --> 11:00.400
the idea that our memory on an everyday level is quite fallible. Memory is one of our only

11:00.400 --> 11:05.760
connections with the past. In many ways how we remember the world makes up the essence of who

11:05.760 --> 11:11.600
we are as a person. We go about our lives under the assumption that what we remember is entirely

11:11.600 --> 11:17.680
accurate and it's terrifying to consider that our assessment of reality may only be tenuous at best.

11:18.240 --> 11:24.560
Ultimately memory is a lot like underwear. We use it every day, it's necessary for our daily lives

11:24.560 --> 11:29.520
and we always have it on unless we're very intoxicated. We don't tend to think about it

11:29.520 --> 11:35.920
very much because it seems so straightforward and reliable. Unfortunately both memory and underwear

11:35.920 --> 11:40.960
are doomed to wind up permanently stained with something we don't quite understand.

11:40.960 --> 11:47.360
A cornucopia much like a memory is a relic of a bygone time, a token of the past that will forever

11:47.360 --> 11:53.600
remain frustratingly out of reach. At least now you can appreciate being in the now. The present

11:53.600 --> 11:59.200
makes up a tiny fraction of our lives compared to the past and future but it's the only time frame

11:59.200 --> 12:05.200
we will ever truly know. We live in an unprecedented era when we are no longer encumbered by the

12:05.200 --> 12:10.960
imperfections of memory alone. Almost everybody on earth now has the ability to capture a moment

12:10.960 --> 12:17.120
in time with as much detail as you can fit on an HD display. Thanks to the technology of the future

12:17.120 --> 12:22.560
our connection with the past has never been stronger. So be sure to preserve the past by

12:22.560 --> 12:28.560
taking plenty of photos and videos in the present. Enjoy the now, even the mundane details because

12:28.560 --> 12:41.920
you never know just how suddenly things can change.

12:41.920 --> 13:00.400
Oh hey, how nice of you to stop by. I was just getting ready to chow down on another delicious

13:00.400 --> 13:06.240
Thanksgiving feast. So Rusty, do you remember a cornucopia in the Fruit of the Loom logo?

13:07.120 --> 13:13.520
Do I ever? Of course I do. No, of course I don't. Why would there be a cornucopia in the Fruit of

13:13.520 --> 13:19.440
the Loom logo? It doesn't make any sense. Is Fruit of the Loom supposed to be a Thanksgiving-based

13:20.560 --> 13:27.200
underwear company? Is this all part of the Mandela Effect? The whole thing, did Mandela die or was he

13:27.200 --> 13:32.800
just in prison for a long time? Can you imagine how disrespectful or how disrespectful it is?

13:32.800 --> 13:36.240
Not can you even imagine. It definitely is. Is the man dead or is he still alive?

13:37.200 --> 13:44.880
I mean, all right, it's very effing stupid that people are confusing movies that

13:46.240 --> 13:52.480
include huge stars. Like, all right, did Kazaam actually have a movie about a genie starring

13:52.480 --> 14:01.760
Shaquille O'Neal or was it Shazam with a largely forgotten actor Sinbad? Of course it was Kazaam

14:02.560 --> 14:07.200
with Shaquille O'Neal, the movie that everyone remembers if you're older than 20 years old.

14:08.560 --> 14:13.200
Oh boy, sounds like yet another classic Thanksgiving dinner table rant.

14:13.840 --> 14:17.520
It's a good thing I have these noise-isolating Raycon earbuds.

14:23.840 --> 14:28.080
