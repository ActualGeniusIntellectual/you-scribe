7760	11680	Fruit of the Loom is an American clothing manufacturer most well known for selling
11680	16720	underwear. Most people recognize the brand for their colorful logo which has nothing to do with
16720	21360	underwear. In the middle is a big red apple surrounded by three different colored grapes
21360	26640	and dark green leaves. According to official sources that's all there is to the Fruit of
26640	31120	the Loom logo, but many people will claim that this version is missing something.
34720	40000	One of the strangest topics of obscure online lore is the discrepancy over whether the Fruit
40000	45680	of the Loom logo ever contained a cornucopia. It's an example of the Mandela Effect,
45680	50160	a phenomenon where many people's memories do not match up with reality.
50160	54720	Many examples of the Mandela Effect can be chalked up to common misconceptions.
54720	60400	The often cited Berenstain Bears is most likely misremembered due to how common the suffix steen
60400	66560	is in proper names. People misspell Looney Tunes because of how they're used to spelling cartoon.
66560	69920	People misspell Fruit Loops because of how they're used to spelling fruit.
70560	76080	A lot of these erroneous memories are created out of a company stylizing a certain word in a logo
76080	81120	and our brains auto-correcting it to a more conventional version. Anyone who has ever
81120	85520	studied for a history exam can tell you that we can't always count on our memory.
85520	91040	We utilize a combination of schemas and heuristics to efficiently process information.
91040	96720	These cognitive techniques give us speed at the cost of accuracy. They allow us to read scrambled
96720	102320	words like these but sometimes they cause us to miss information hiding in plain sight. On my
102320	107840	Dale Earnhardt video I missed this typo despite reviewing it nearly a hundred times in editing.
107840	112160	Sometimes our minds play tricks on us and we see things that aren't really there.
113200	120400	This is the construct. Most psychologists believe that memory is a reconstructive process.
120400	125120	We recall information not through identical snapshots of events but by piecing together
125120	130160	a scene through a series of key details. Reconstruction prevents memories from being
130160	136320	100% faithful to reality. No one can pay attention to all the minutia of an event.
136320	141760	So beyond a certain point of specificity certain details will be left out rendering our memories
141760	146960	forever incomplete. In addition to this reconstruction may be influenced by several
146960	153200	other cognitive processes resulting in distortions. Sometimes people may reconstruct a single memory
153200	158320	out of multiple separate but similar events. This is likely the reason behind some people
158320	165920	remembering the mythical Sinbad Genie movie Shazam. In 1996 Shaq starred in a movie called Kazaam
165920	171920	two years after a Sinbad TV airing in which he dressed like a genie. The Lost Sinbad movie was
171920	178160	simply the result of people conflating these similar events. There was no Jiffy Peanut Butter
178160	185040	only Jiff and Skippy. When recalling information we tend to either miss details or mix up details
185040	190960	with something else very similar. What is far more unusual is recalling a unique detail that
190960	196560	supposedly never existed. The Fruit of the Loom discrepancy implies that numerous people are
196560	202320	falsely inserting an extraneous object into the recollection of the logo. This isn't the same as
202320	208080	people misremembering a monocle on the Monopoly Man. Caricatures of wealthy aristocrats are often
208080	213120	depicted with a top hat and monocle so it's entirely plausible that people would project
213120	218720	the image of a monocle onto their memories of Mr Monopoly. Ultimately the error is nothing more
218720	223680	than adding a small circle and line to a monochromatic drawing. With the Fruit of the Loom
223680	229280	logo people are supposedly mistaken and envisioning a distinct brown object unlike anything else in
229280	234960	the frame. A cornucopia also known as a horn of plenty is not exactly a common object.
235520	242000	wordcount.org ranks the term cornucopia around the 42,000th most common word in the English language.
242000	246640	I'd imagine that for most of you watching it's a word that only crosses your mind maybe once
246640	252640	per year. Even on the rare occasion that someone does encounter the term its most common present
252640	257920	day use is the figurative sense meaning abundance or the term used to describe the place with all
257920	263120	the weapons in the Hunger Games. The physical object the word is referring to serves the very
263120	268640	niche purpose of a decorative autumn accessory. Cornucopias are most frequently depicted among
268640	274240	fruits and vegetables common to the fall harvest. This includes apples and grapes but more often
274240	279920	features pumpkins squash corn and sunflowers crops you'd expect to see around Thanksgiving
279920	285760	time. For most of us the sight of a cornucopia will evoke a color palette of gold brown and orange
285760	291040	consistent with the changing vegetation of autumn. These colors are mostly absent from the Fruit of
291040	296320	the Loom logo so it's somewhat far-fetched to infer that this image would naturally prime people
296320	301760	to think of a cornucopia. If that were the case then wouldn't people be mistaking a cornucopia
301760	307600	out of any logo with a pile of fruit? To make matters more bizarre many who claim to remember
307600	312880	the cornucopia mentioned that they first learned about the object from the Fruit of the Loom logo.
312880	317600	Some recall specific conversations with their parents in which they mistook the object for a
317600	323280	seashell or a bugle chip. Others distinctly remember mistakenly referring to the cornucopia
323280	328800	as the loom which is another term most young children haven't learned yet. It's much harder
328800	333680	to dismiss this version of the logo as a fabrication when so many corresponding memories
333680	340800	exist. Most people claim the cornucopia logo existed in the 1990s and early 2000s although
340800	348240	some recall a cornucopia as far back as the 60s and 70s. In 1973 jazz musician Frank West released
348240	353280	a parody of the underwear brand whose album cover referenced the shape of a cornucopia.
353280	358640	In 2006 the film Ant Bully depicted a pair of underwear clearly based on the Fruit of the Loom
358640	364800	brand which also features a cornucopia. In the 2012 South Park episode about zip lining
364800	369280	Cartman's underwear portrayed an additional reference to Fruit of the Loom which once
369280	374480	again depicts a cornucopia. These are three different kinds of media from three different
374480	379200	decades all portraying the same object in reference to Fruit of the Loom's logo.
379920	384960	Additional references to the cornucopia can be found in various print sources across the time
384960	391040	span. However in stark contrast to the abundance of personal testimony and secondary sources
391040	396640	regarding the logo physical evidence of the cornucopia's existence has proven hard to come by.
397200	401440	Over the years Fruit of the Loom has sold conceivably millions of products
401440	406800	so how is it that hardly anyone has been able to produce even a single example of the cornucopia
406800	411920	existing on old clothing? Solving the paradox is seemingly as easy as reaching into your
411920	417040	old underwear drawer and finding a pair with a design. So why can't anyone seem to do it?
424320	428720	Vintage Fruit of the Loom ads aren't much better at helping us find the cornucopia.
428720	433520	Many followers of the theory like to point to this canceled trademark filed by the U.S.
433520	439360	patent database as evidence. However the legal code cited in the paperwork is liberally applied
439360	445360	to any trademark with a pile of fruit so we can't assume this is significant for Fruit of the Loom.
445360	450720	Company representatives continue to deny that any trace of a cornucopia ever existed
450720	455120	leaving many ardent supporters of the elusive logo utterly baffled.
455120	460320	The result is one of the most mysterious and widespread misconceptions of our time.
460320	465520	It's a dilemma that makes no sense for either side. Why would so many people erroneously
465520	471440	believe that such a visually distinct object once existed in the logo and why would Fruit of the Loom
471440	476560	have any reason to instigate a mass cover-up? This was something people all around the world
476560	481520	would see every time they pulled down their pants to use the toilet. How could it result in this
481520	487200	much confusion? Well going back to previous examples one explanation for the discrepancy
487200	491120	would be that people are simply confusing the Fruit of the Loom logo with some other
491120	497120	prominent logo featuring a cornucopia. Browsing the U.S. trademark registry reveals several other
497120	502400	similar logo designs but none belonging to brands prominent enough to reasonably create such a
502400	507680	widespread dispute. Some like to point to the brown leaves of a previous logo iteration and
507680	512320	claim that people have confused that for the cornucopia. While the shape and formation of
512320	517520	the leaves is not at all like the supposed cornucopia design it is somewhat plausible
517520	522880	that on very small print versions of the tag some people may have mixed up the two. Another
522880	528000	explanation could be that the cornucopia version of the logo was only printed on knockoff versions
528000	533360	of the main brand. Knockoffs are common for virtually any brand of apparel but Fruit of the
533360	539120	Loom typically marketed itself as an inexpensive consumer product so it seems unlikely that a
539120	543600	generic clone could claim enough of the market share to fool so many people about the true
543600	549840	appearance of the logo. It's possible that the cornucopia logo only existed as a seasonal variant
549840	554800	or as part of a special collection. This could explain why people can only find the standard
554800	561120	fruit version. Maybe the cornucopia only existed on some tags of Fruit of the Loom products rather
561120	566960	than serving as the official logo. Either way these explanations don't help us justify why
566960	572640	physical versions of the cornucopia don't seem to exist. More radical theories point to the idea
572640	578240	of parallel universes and timeline swapping. The possibility that our consciousness was seamlessly
578240	583520	transferred to a totally separate but equally plausible reality. A reality where everything
583520	588720	is identical except for a few cosmetic differences between brand names and an undiscovered Sinbad
588720	602720	movie. At the end of the day does it really matter whether or not the Fruit of the Loom logo has a
602720	608800	cornucopia or whether Kate Kat has a hyphen or whether the tip of Pikachu's tail is black?
608800	615120	The Mandela effect is largely a manifestation of the mundane. Information which is not salient
615120	620480	enough for us to pay close attention. Everyone in America has probably seen the face of a penny
620480	625920	over a thousand times but how many of us can accurately recreate all of its components from
625920	631280	memory? The fact of the matter is that the face of a penny is not relevant to how we understand
631280	637520	it as an object. There's no disputing who was president in 1985 or what the score was before
637520	643360	the Atlanta Falcons choked in Super Bowl 51. We tend to remember whatever we find important,
643360	648560	fascinating or unique and oftentimes your underwear tag doesn't quite fall into that
648560	655120	category. Sometimes it's easier to imagine that reality itself has been distorted than confront
655120	660400	the idea that our memory on an everyday level is quite fallible. Memory is one of our only
660400	665760	connections with the past. In many ways how we remember the world makes up the essence of who
665760	671600	we are as a person. We go about our lives under the assumption that what we remember is entirely
671600	677680	accurate and it's terrifying to consider that our assessment of reality may only be tenuous at best.
678240	684560	Ultimately memory is a lot like underwear. We use it every day, it's necessary for our daily lives
684560	689520	and we always have it on unless we're very intoxicated. We don't tend to think about it
689520	695920	very much because it seems so straightforward and reliable. Unfortunately both memory and underwear
695920	700960	are doomed to wind up permanently stained with something we don't quite understand.
700960	707360	A cornucopia much like a memory is a relic of a bygone time, a token of the past that will forever
707360	713600	remain frustratingly out of reach. At least now you can appreciate being in the now. The present
713600	719200	makes up a tiny fraction of our lives compared to the past and future but it's the only time frame
719200	725200	we will ever truly know. We live in an unprecedented era when we are no longer encumbered by the
725200	730960	imperfections of memory alone. Almost everybody on earth now has the ability to capture a moment
730960	737120	in time with as much detail as you can fit on an HD display. Thanks to the technology of the future
737120	742560	our connection with the past has never been stronger. So be sure to preserve the past by
742560	748560	taking plenty of photos and videos in the present. Enjoy the now, even the mundane details because
748560	761920	you never know just how suddenly things can change.
761920	780400	Oh hey, how nice of you to stop by. I was just getting ready to chow down on another delicious
780400	786240	Thanksgiving feast. So Rusty, do you remember a cornucopia in the Fruit of the Loom logo?
787120	793520	Do I ever? Of course I do. No, of course I don't. Why would there be a cornucopia in the Fruit of
793520	799440	the Loom logo? It doesn't make any sense. Is Fruit of the Loom supposed to be a Thanksgiving-based
800560	807200	underwear company? Is this all part of the Mandela Effect? The whole thing, did Mandela die or was he
807200	812800	just in prison for a long time? Can you imagine how disrespectful or how disrespectful it is?
812800	816240	Not can you even imagine. It definitely is. Is the man dead or is he still alive?
817200	824880	I mean, all right, it's very effing stupid that people are confusing movies that
826240	832480	include huge stars. Like, all right, did Kazaam actually have a movie about a genie starring
832480	841760	Shaquille O'Neal or was it Shazam with a largely forgotten actor Sinbad? Of course it was Kazaam
842560	847200	with Shaquille O'Neal, the movie that everyone remembers if you're older than 20 years old.
848560	853200	Oh boy, sounds like yet another classic Thanksgiving dinner table rant.
