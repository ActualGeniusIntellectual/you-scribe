0	10640	When you're stuck in traffic, it's easy to lose your temper.
10640	15620	Sometimes we encounter other drivers so insanely idiotic that they make us question who decided
15620	17620	to give them a license.
17620	20280	Driving this poorly should be a crime.
20280	23480	Sometimes it is, and the problem elegantly solves itself.
23480	27760	But most of the time, the idiot just gets away scot-free.
27760	31960	Not content with the unfairness of it all, a few of us will try to take justice into
31960	36280	our own hands, often with less than fortunate results.
36280	46360	Before you plan an act of road retribution, you may want to seek out wisdom from the experts.
46360	50440	Motorsports feature the most talented drivers in the world, but they still succumb to the
50440	52940	same emotions as the rest of us.
52940	57420	With potentially millions of dollars on the line, patience on the racetrack runs very
57420	58500	thin.
58500	62800	Auto racing provides a unique opportunity for drivers to destroy each other's vehicles
62800	66060	without any legal or financial repercussions.
66060	70460	In series like NASCAR, the cars are durable enough to dish out some serious punishment
70460	72880	without jeopardizing themselves.
72880	76140	Most racing accidents are just that, accidents.
76140	80760	But in NASCAR, a few wrecks are not just intentional, but premeditated.
80760	86040	On track, the best drivers are just as skilled at retaliation as they are at racing.
86040	94720	Revenge in NASCAR comes in many forms, some more elegant than others.
94720	98880	The most proficient retaliators are discreet enough to make you think twice over whether
98880	101140	or not it was even on purpose.
101140	105320	But by far the most entertaining revenge is the opposite of discreet.
105320	110060	In this video, I'm going to talk about seven cases of revenge so outrageously blatant
110060	117400	that nobody could see it as anything other than pure, unadulterated retribution.
117400	122120	Our first tale comes from the winding turns of Sonoma, California, one of the few road
122120	124460	courses on the NASCAR schedule.
124460	128500	These types of tracks give NASCAR drivers the opportunity to do something they rarely
128500	133340	ever get to do, turn right.
133340	138340	And Sonoma's most eventful right turn is, without a doubt, turn 11, a tight hairpin
138340	144460	that forces drivers to decelerate from 120 to 40 miles per hour in just a few seconds.
144460	151620	In one race, two drivers are about to get very familiar with turn 11 and each other.
151620	155620	It's lap 37 of the 2011 Toyota Save Mart 350.
155620	159180	Tony Stewart has a fast car, but he's stuck back in traffic.
159180	164140	Tony's getting a bit frustrated with Brian Vickers, who refuses to give up his position.
164140	170900	By the time they reach turn 11, Tony has had enough and dumps him.
170900	174860	During this time, Tony Stewart is one of the most formidable and aggressive drivers in
174860	176060	the sport.
176060	180900	If you raced him the wrong way, he would not hesitate to take you out of contention.
180900	185380	Over the years, dozens of drivers have fallen prey to Stewart's retaliation.
185380	189120	And for a moment, Vickers looked to be yet another victim.
189120	192400	The race continues and Tony works his way through the pack.
192400	198000	By lap 85, he's cruising to a top-five finish when the broadcast cuts to commercial.
198000	205860	When they come back, Tony Stewart has been sent to the Shadow Realm.
205860	210840	It took Brian Vickers more than 50 laps to get back to Stewart, and when he did, he sure
210840	212280	made the most of it.
212280	217000	Vickers hooked Tony at the precise speed and angle to strain him on the tire barrier, knocking
217000	219000	him out of the race entirely.
219000	223900	A well-orchestrated act of payback, but one that would ultimately prove inconsequential
223900	225840	in the grand scheme of things.
225840	230000	Vickers may have won the battle that day, but it wouldn't stop Tony Stewart from eventually
230000	233700	winning his third and final cup championship that season.
233700	237960	At the very least though, Tony didn't wreck anyone else for a while after this.
237960	243420	They say that revenge is a dish best served cold, and in NASCAR, some drivers prefer to
243420	246420	bide their time before dishing out their payback.
246420	262060	In the 2000s, Robbie Gordon was possibly the only NASCAR driver more aggressive than
262060	263420	Tony Stewart.
263420	266740	Robbie was the racing embodiment of chaos.
266740	271100	His decisions on the racetrack seemed to be governed entirely by impulse.
271100	275660	He would do things on the track that seemed completely pointless to anyone else but him.
275660	287740	These loose cannon antics made him one of the most entertaining drivers to watch.
287740	298180	He was the driver to boldly go where no other driver had gone before.
298180	302720	Robbie Gordon was most well-known as one of NASCAR's best road course racers, but his
302720	307200	most bombastic moments would come at the Magic Mile in New Hampshire.
307200	312320	In 2001, Robbie would infamously score his first ever NASCAR victory there by moving
312320	314280	Jeff Gordon out of the way.
314280	318620	In the 2004 race, he would get spun by Greg Biffle and then hunt him back down like a
318620	323380	heat-seeking missile, taking out two other championship contenders in the process.
323380	327260	But believe it or not, this wasn't even the best example of Robbie getting revenge at
327260	328660	New Hampshire.
328660	332940	So based on what we've seen so far, it's generally a bad idea to piss off Robbie Gordon
332940	334340	on the racetrack.
334340	339100	In the 2005 Sylvania 300, Michael Waltrip did just that.
339100	343500	By this season, Robbie Gordon had become fed up with answering to any team owner above
343500	345440	him, so he opened up his own team.
345440	350340	He would run the 2005 campaign as NASCAR's only owner driver.
350340	354220	Financing your own race team comes with a lot of autonomy, but at the cost of a lot
354220	356020	of, well, money.
356020	360260	Any on-track mishaps would now have to come directly out of Robbie's own pocket.
360260	364740	Considering his track record at that point, it was a pretty risky spot to be in.
364740	368220	So how did Robbie do in his first year as his own boss?
368220	369220	Pretty awful.
369220	374060	By September, he has only won top 10 and has failed to qualify for four races.
374060	379380	He's sitting a dreadful 36th in points, but he has a pretty decent run going at New Hampshire.
379380	383820	That is until, while under caution, Michael Waltrip hooks him into the wall and totals
383820	385060	his car.
385100	387580	Needless to say, Robbie Gordon is not happy.
387580	393500	About the 15, then he said, NASCAR, I hope you're listening, I will pay Michael Waltrip
393500	394500	back.
394500	399540	Robbie vows revenge against Michael, but after many months of inaction, everyone has pretty
399540	401180	much forgotten about it.
401180	404580	The following July, the Cup Series returns to New Hampshire.
404580	409660	In 2006, Waltrip had become the co-owner of his own racing team, and just like Robbie
409660	411500	the year before, he was struggling.
411940	416780	Late in the race, Michael finds himself lined up behind who else but Robbie Gordon.
416780	420580	Everyone else may have forgotten what happened the year prior, but Robbie sure hasn't.
420580	423620	Our guys are trying to come back to us.
423620	424620	How did that happen?
424620	427020	He's crashed back there and broke into the radio.
427020	431620	Robbie Gordon didn't have many victories in his NASCAR career, but when he did win,
431620	435300	he made sure to do it in a way that was unmistakably his.
435300	439440	Drivers like Robbie are all but extinct in NASCAR today, but back in the day, it was
439480	443280	common to see lots of drivers march to the beat of their own drum.
443280	447280	If you were looking for a driver to inspire excitement, then perhaps you'd find it in
447280	449360	Mr. Excitement, Jimmy Spencer.
449360	452360	It's going to be a drag race to the checkered flag!
452360	454400	Jimmy Spencer wins it!
454400	459160	Jimmy Spencer would get into a litany of fights and altercations over the course of his career,
459160	462660	but none was more heated than his feud with Kurt Busch.
462660	467000	At the turn of the millennium, Kurt Busch was one of the fastest rising talents in the
467000	468000	sport.
468000	472580	In 1991, he was promoted to a full-time cup ride at just the age of 22.
472580	477600	In his rookie season as NASCAR's newest phenom, Kurt Busch got rocked.
477600	481740	He finished 27th in points with seven DNFs, and his biggest highlight of the year was
481740	485000	being the last guy Dale Earnhardt ever flipped off.
485000	490160	It's tough being a rookie at NASCAR's highest level, a lesson Kurt learned in the 2001 Phoenix
490160	494320	race where he got turned by Jimmy Spencer in front of the entire field.
494320	496600	Welcome to the big leagues, kid.
496600	500880	At this point in time, Jimmy Spencer is in the opposite position of Kurt Busch.
500880	504720	He's in the twilight of his career and his best days are long behind him.
504720	510400	But in the 2002 Food City 500 at Bristol, Jimmy Spencer has the opportunity to do something
510400	515080	he hasn't done in nearly eight years, win a cup series race.
515080	518860	He's running second with just 60 laps to go and reeling in the leader.
518860	522980	The only problem is that the driver running first is the same guy Jimmy Spencer wrecked
522980	524780	just five months earlier.
524780	527260	Of course, Kurt doesn't cut Jimmy any slack.
537760	540980	On this day, youth prevails over experience.
540980	545420	After the race, however, Spencer ominously warns that the young driver still has much
545420	546420	to learn.
546420	549160	There's a lot of things you can and can't do, and one thing you can't do is just beat
549160	550160	and bang with people.
550160	553660	And some guys have to learn, and they just have to learn the hard way.
553660	558720	Five months later at Indianapolis, Spencer punted Busch at over 180 miles per hour.
558720	563280	He just booted him out of the way.
563280	567920	Kurt is absolutely livid and trashes Spencer in the post-wreck interview.
567920	571680	We spun and that put us in a bad position, back there with the decrepit old has-beens,
571680	572680	I guess.
572680	577140	The feud continues to escalate until it reaches a boiling point in the next year's race at
577140	578140	Michigan.
578140	581700	Kurt swerves into Spencer trying to cut down one of his tires.
581700	585220	After the race, Spencer reportedly marched over to Kurt's car and punched him in the
585220	586220	face.
586220	592020	Jimmy got out of the car, approached Kurt Busch, and actually punched Kurt Busch.
592020	596440	Kurt left with a bloody nose and a chipped tooth, prompting NASCAR to suspend Jimmy Spencer
596440	597860	for the next race.
597860	602420	Now, at this point, it's important to recall that Jimmy Spencer has thus far demolished
602420	607260	two of Kurt's race cars and his face, and the fans love him for it.
607260	611960	The next race is littered with free Jimmy Spencer signs, and Mr. Excitement is arguably
611960	614300	the most popular he's ever been.
614300	619440	Sometimes a NASCAR feud represents more than just a simple disagreement between drivers.
619440	624340	Kurt Busch and Jimmy Spencer symbolized a clash of generations in a changing sport.
624340	629440	In the eyes of many fans at the time, Kurt Busch embodied a new wave of prima donna drivers
629440	643560	who lacked the struggle and grit of seasoned veterans like Jimmy Spencer.
643560	647700	Back in the day, drivers would settle disputes among themselves without any interference
647700	649480	from the sanctioning body.
649480	654640	Many felt that NASCAR was babying down the sport to conform to a more mainstream image.
654640	659140	Too bad for them, NASCAR was entering a new age whether they were ready or not.
659140	663820	Just one year afterwards, Kurt Busch would sit atop the sport as champion.
663820	668820	Not long after that, Jimmy Spencer would retire and find a new home on the speed channel.
668820	673120	While Kurt got the best of him in their time as competitors, Jimmy Spencer always finds
673120	685420	a way to have the last laugh.
685420	690060	Despite starting off as polar opposite rivals, Kurt Busch and Jimmy Spencer didn't end
690060	692080	up being so different after all.
692080	694060	NASCAR is always changing.
694060	709980	Cry as you might, you can't stop the future.
709980	715060	One of Kurt Busch's many career rivalries was a sibling rivalry with his brother Kyle.
715060	720260	If Kurt was a can't miss talent, the younger Busch brother was a generational prodigy.
720260	725460	While it took Kurt until age 23 to win in the cup series, Kyle did it at just 20 in
725460	726740	his rookie season.
726740	730540	Currently, he's in the conversation with Jeff Gordon and Jimmy Johnson as one of the
730540	733420	greatest drivers of NASCAR's current era.
733420	738700	In 2007, all three of these drivers raced on the same team, Hendrick Motorsports.
738700	743540	Unfortunately, such great amassments of talent don't tend to stick around for very long.
743540	747460	In the middle of the season, Kyle Busch wants out at Hendrick.
747460	752040	Just like his brother, Kyle Busch had the tendency to lose his temper and had reportedly
752040	755260	worn out his welcome with team owner Rick Hendrick.
755260	759260	Despite his skirmish with Kurt in the All-Star race, Kyle Busch's greatest rival wouldn't
759260	760780	come from his brother.
760780	768020	It would come from his replacement.
768020	772500	By the mid-2000s, Dale Earnhardt Jr.'s race team was on a downward spiral, and he was
772500	775940	about to become the biggest free agent in all of NASCAR.
775940	780940	As the sport's most popular star, Dale Jr. would provide an immediate boon to any team
780940	781940	that signed him.
781940	785980	Naturally, one of the first team owners to approach Jr. was Rick Hendrick.
785980	790940	Beyond the appeal of joining NASCAR's most successful team, Jr. bonded with Rick Hendrick
790940	793100	on a very personal level.
793100	797300	Both had suffered tragic losses of family members earlier in the decade.
797300	802380	With all that considered, Earnhardt and Hendrick were a match that seemed destined to happen.
802380	805860	It's the 2007 Samsung 500 at Texas.
805860	811140	On lap 252, Tony Stewart spins and Kyle Busch rear-ends Jr. in the scramble.
811140	814180	Kyle thinks his car is total and retires from the race.
814180	817980	Unbeknownst to him, however, his pit crew repairs the car and wants to send it back
817980	820440	on track to pick up some extra points.
820440	823580	The only problem is that Kyle Busch has gone AWOL.
823580	828140	The team scurries to find a replacement driver just as Dale Jr. is pulling his wrecked car
828140	829720	into the garage.
829720	834440	Long story short, Dale Jr. ended up finishing the race in Kyle Busch's car that day.
834440	843040	And so today, it is with great honor to introduce my new boss for 2008, Mr. Rick Hendrick.
843040	847860	Was it a bizarre coincidence or perhaps a covert audition for his next ride?
847860	851900	We may never know all the answers, but one thing's for sure, it wouldn't be the last
851900	858760	incident involving Dale Jr. and Kyle Busch that season.
858800	863200	Six months later, Kyle Busch is in a fierce battle for the point lead heading into Kansas
863200	866140	while Jr. is out of championship contention.
866140	870000	By this point, it's well known that Earnhardt will be replacing Kyle Busch at the end of
870000	874440	the season, but Kyle is still trying to make the most of his lame duck run by going out
874440	875720	with a bang.
875720	880120	Just 30 laps in, however, Jr. runs over Kyle Busch on the backstretch and takes him out
880120	881120	of the race.
881120	885920	After it was over, Jr. apologized and said it was an accident, but Kyle Busch would not
885920	899320	so easily forget the driver who cost him his first shot at a championship.
899320	904040	It's the spring of 2008, and Dale Jr. wants badly to win for his new team.
904040	907200	He is currently in the midst of a 70-race winless streak.
907200	912360	Meanwhile, Kyle Busch is riding high in his new Joe Gibbs Racing Toyota, winning two of
912360	914580	the first nine races on the season.
914580	919060	In the final laps at Richmond, Dale Jr. is just a few miles from victory.
919060	932340	Kyle Busch, however, has other plans.
932340	936820	One could say that the end of this race profoundly shaped the next few years in NASCAR.
936820	941420	Kyle Busch finished 2008 with eight victories and was instantly rocketed to public enemy
941420	948340	number one in the sport.
948340	953300	For Dale Jr., the incident would mark the beginning of the worst stretch of his career.
953300	958340	After 2008, Jr. would not see victory lane for the next three seasons.
958340	963580	In some cases, revenge can end up having far more influence than just a petty comeuppance.
963580	966380	It can go on to define a driver's legacy.
966380	971100	This event cemented Kyle Busch as a dominant villain and Dale Jr. as a lovable underdog
971100	973380	who could never seem to catch a break.
973380	977060	Two perceptions that neither driver could ever really overcome.
977060	981100	Do you think that if Dale and Kyle could go back to this moment, history could have turned
981100	982100	out differently?
982100	990140	Well, the next time they went to Richmond, history repeated itself instead.
990140	994820	Revenge in NASCAR can greatly influence how we perceive other drivers, but very rarely
994820	1010940	does it influence the actual outcome of a season.
1010940	1016900	In 2014, NASCAR introduced the controversial elimination-style playoff format, an unintended
1016900	1022840	consequence of which was giving drivers tremendous leverage and potentially spoiling the competition.
1022840	1027040	If you're going to have a feud in NASCAR, you absolutely do not want to start one of
1027040	1028040	the playoffs.
1028040	1029960	So let's talk about Martinsville.
1029960	1034640	It's the oldest remaining track on the NASCAR schedule, which really shows from its unique
1034640	1035920	design.
1035920	1037960	Remember Turn 11 from Sonoma?
1037960	1042640	Well, double it back and that's basically the entire Martinsville racetrack.
1042640	1046740	Of course, the close quarters racing creates the perfect breeding ground for tempers to
1046740	1047740	flare.
1047740	1051960	With the added pressure of the playoffs, the fall Martinsville race turns the intensity
1051960	1053600	up to 11.
1053600	1058000	Denny Hamlin had always been one of NASCAR's most consistent drivers, but he could never
1058000	1060940	quite put it together when it counted most.
1060940	1064660	Every time he found himself in position to contend for the championship, he would always
1064660	1067680	end up suffering some inexplicable mishap.
1067680	1073020	Heading into the 2017 playoff race at Martinsville, he's sitting sixth in points.
1073020	1077400	If he wants to advance to the championship finale, he's going to have to catch a serious
1077400	1078400	break.
1078400	1081280	Chase Elliott is in quite a different place than Denny.
1081280	1085920	He's not just looking for his first career championship, he's looking for his first career
1085920	1086920	win.
1086920	1091840	At age 21, he's in just his second full-time cup season, but the expectations surrounding
1091840	1095920	him are about as high as any other prospect the sport has ever seen.
1095920	1098800	Chase Elliott is a part of racing royalty.
1098800	1103360	The son of NASCAR legend Bill Elliott, he has spent the past half decade as NASCAR's
1103360	1105800	most anticipated young star.
1105800	1111960	By 2017, he's next in line behind Dale Jr. as the sport's perennial most popular driver.
1111960	1116800	But more than 70 races into his cup career, he still has yet to win at NASCAR's highest
1116800	1117800	level.
1117800	1121860	Today at Martinsville, Chase has a pretty good shot at finally breaking through to victory
1121860	1122860	lane.
1122860	1127000	Winning here wouldn't just validate the talent of the young phenom, it would punch his ticket
1127000	1129080	to the championship race.
1129080	1133800	He's led over 100 laps so far, and with just four laps to go, he pulls ahead of the field
1133800	1136760	and looks to be cruising to a fairytale ending.
1136760	1141640	Too bad for Chase, the driver behind him is Denny Hamlin, who is not about to let another
1141640	1151360	opportunity go to waste.
1151360	1156800	Chase Elliott did not win on this day, but luckily for our story, neither did Hamlin.
1156800	1161120	Denny swung for the fences in the closing laps of this race, but in doing so, he just
1161120	1179800	made himself the biggest target in NASCAR.
1179800	1182880	It's now one race before the championship finale.
1182880	1187320	In the closing laps, Denny Hamlin is holding on to the final transfer spot by the slimmest
1187320	1188760	of margins.
1188760	1192880	It was at this point that Chase Elliott taught Hamlin a lesson in why you should never mess
1192880	1215800	with racing royalty.
1215800	1220000	Believe it or not, this wasn't the first time the driver of the 24 car got revenge
1220000	1232760	at Phoenix for something that happened at Martinsville.
1232760	1237560	Of course, the former driver of the 24 car was none other than Jeff Gordon, who was in
1237560	1241200	the conversation for the greatest stock car driver ever.
1241200	1246400	In 1998, he drove the greatest statistical season in NASCAR's modern era, scoring an
1246400	1249580	unthinkable average finish of 5.7.
1249580	1253700	His 2012 season, on the other hand, was not quite as spectacular.
1253700	1258360	After the first five races, he is sitting a dismal 25th in the point standings.
1258360	1261060	He's looking to turn his luck around at Martinsville.
1261060	1264940	Winning here would have extra significance because at this point, Hendrick Motorsports
1264940	1267520	is sitting at 199 wins.
1267520	1271400	Over the whole season, everyone has been wondering which Hendrick driver will take the honor
1271400	1274540	of scoring win number 200 for the team.
1274540	1279360	So far, no Hendrick driver has won in 2012, but on this day, it certainly looks like it's
1279360	1280520	going to happen.
1280520	1285260	With 10 laps to go, Jeff Gordon is in an amazing battle with his teammate Jimmy Johnson.
1285260	1290040	So it looks like, barring a completely preposterous turn of events, that Rick Hendrick will get
1290040	1291960	his 200th victory.
1291960	1296480	Just as Gordon makes the pass on Johnson with five to go, the caution comes out.
1296480	1300720	For reasons we still don't understand to this day, David Rudiman doesn't come to
1300720	1305020	pit road during an obvious mechanical issue and stalls out on the front stretch.
1305020	1308800	The field lines back up and the two Hendrick cars look to settle it on what should be the
1308800	1310240	final restart.
1310240	1314200	The only problem now is that they're on worn tires and are sitting ducks to the pack
1314200	1316400	behind them who pitted for fresh tires.
1316400	1322020	Looks like the main possibly clamped Boyer in the 15 won the battle off pit road.
1322020	1324080	That's the guy you better keep an eye on.
1324080	1328560	Well, the green flag drops and both Hendrick cars get a poor jump off the line.
1328560	1332720	Simultaneously, Ryan Newman gives one of the biggest shelves in Martinsville history to
1332720	1336040	Clint Boyer, who's directly behind the Hendrick cars.
1336040	1340440	With nowhere else to really go, Boyer makes the split second decision to dive bomb inside
1340440	1341800	of Jeff Gordon.
1341800	1344960	Three wide in a turn one at Martinsville.
1344960	1346960	This went about as well as you may have guessed.
1346960	1348960	Boyer shot, getting out of the triple!
1348960	1349960	Three wide, three wide!
1349960	1350960	There goes Newman!
1350960	1352960	Newman's going to take the lead!
1352960	1356080	That was not pretty!
1356080	1360420	Clint Boyer was a driver who always seemed to be in the wrong place at the wrong time.
1360420	1365360	He is perhaps best known for finishing the 07 Daytona 500 upside down.
1365360	1369640	He was still talented enough to occasionally win a race or two, but whenever Clint found
1369640	1372800	success, misfortune always seemed to follow.
1372800	1375940	The 2012 race at Martinsville is no exception.
1375940	1380320	Looking back, it's hard to say Clint did anything wrong in this situation, but he still ended
1380320	1382160	up bearing the brunt of the controversy.
1382560	1385720	Well, Clint and I are friends, you know, and I have a lot of respect for him.
1385720	1389040	He's a great race car driver and I'm glad I talked to him before I talked to you guys
1389040	1390880	because I was pretty mad at him.
1390880	1393400	After the race, Jeff Gordon is merciful.
1393400	1397680	Their next altercation, however, wouldn't be on such pleasant terms.
1397680	1401760	Six months later, the Cup Series returns to Martinsville and the complexion of the season
1401760	1403440	looks very different.
1403440	1407460	With just four races left, the championship picture is wide open.
1407460	1411720	After the worst start to a year he's ever had, Jeff Gordon has made a remarkable late
1411720	1415720	season comeback to put himself within striking distance of the title.
1415720	1420520	Right in the hunt with Gordon is Clint Boyer, who is having the season of his life.
1420520	1424680	Late in the race at Martinsville, the two make contact in a hard-fought side-by-side
1424680	1425680	battle.
1425680	1428160	This time, Jeff Gordon is not as forgiving.
1428160	1434640	After a second run-in on the season, Clint Boyer is skating on thin ice.
1434640	1438680	Two weeks later at Phoenix, Clint Boyer is closer to the championship than he's ever
1438680	1439680	been.
1439680	1443720	Late in the day, he's running in the top 5 and is less than 30 points behind the championship
1443720	1444720	leader.
1444720	1448560	It's at this moment when Boyer runs into who else but Jeff Gordon.
1448560	1464160	Unfortunately for Boyer, this is the straw that broke the camel's back.
1464160	1468240	It's still surreal watching this back today nearly a decade afterwards.
1468240	1472760	Jeff Gordon hunted down Boyer like a dog and erased his championship hopes in one flick
1472760	1474280	of the steering wheel.
1474280	1478880	What ensued was possibly the biggest melee in the history of NASCAR, but for as many
1478880	1482840	punches that were thrown that day, it didn't change the outcome.
1482840	1486920	Clint Boyer would go on to lose the championship by just 39 points.
1486920	1491560	If Gordon doesn't take him out, it's very possible he could have won the whole thing.
1491560	1495560	Boyer would never again come as close to winning a cup series title.
1495560	1497680	Jeff Gordon is a racing god.
1497680	1500400	He can give and he can take away.
1500400	1505560	It's hard to imagine a moment in NASCAR more savage than Gordon's revenge on Clint Boyer,
1505560	1510420	but believe it or not, there is one incident that tops it, mostly because it came from
1510420	1522240	such an unlikely source.
1522240	1526720	If I could use one word to describe Matt Kenseth's career in NASCAR, it would be
1526720	1527860	overshadowed.
1527860	1532700	If you asked fans to list off the best drivers of the 21st century, many of them would probably
1532700	1534480	forget to mention him.
1534480	1539720	In 2003, he put together one of the most dominant seasons in recent memory, only to have it
1539720	1543480	continually discredited because he only won a single race.
1543480	1548340	Many have inferred that Kenseth's 2003 season directly persuaded NASCAR to overhaul the
1548340	1553860	entire championship format to make sure that a performance like it could never happen again.
1553860	1558000	So what exactly is the problem with a guy like Matt Kenseth nearly leading the points
1558000	1559000	wire-to-wire?
1559000	1564060	Well, the thing is that Matt Kenseth was not exactly the most exciting driver.
1564060	1569020	He had a rather milquetoast personality which many considered to be downright boring to
1569020	1573300	watch, but Matt's relative non-intrigue served more as a testament to how good he
1573300	1575240	was at staying out of trouble.
1575240	1579740	He always played it cool with the media and avoided drama like the plague.
1579740	1583900	On track, he was one of the cleanest and most respectful drivers out there.
1583900	1588780	It was really difficult to recall any examples of Matt Kenseth intentionally wrecking someone
1588780	1589980	in a race.
1589980	1594600	On the very few occasions he did end up in an altercation, he always seemed to take much
1594600	1597000	more punishment than he dished out.
1597000	1599640	So remember Brian Vickers from Chapter 1?
1599640	1604360	Well, getting revenge on Tony Stewart must have awoken some kind of demon within him,
1604360	1608960	because later that season at Martinsville, Vickers went on possibly the biggest rampage
1608960	1610640	in NASCAR history.
1610640	1615860	Throughout the race, Vickers takes out Regan Smith, Montoya, Jamie McMurray, and then starts
1615860	1620400	beating and banging on Matt Kenseth, who at that moment is battling for the championship
1620400	1621400	lead.
1621400	1625560	Kenseth tries to put an end to Vickers reign of terror by punting him out of the way, but
1625560	1628840	that only makes him the sole target of the wrath.
1628840	1632920	Just a few laps later, Vickers plows into the back of Kenseth, who goes on to finish
1632920	1634920	outside of the top 30.
1634920	1639240	Not content with just one act of vengeance, however, Vickers would take out Kenseth again
1639240	1641400	two weeks later at Phoenix.
1641400	1645840	Needless to say, Matt Kenseth didn't end up winning the championship this season.
1645840	1649840	Keep in mind, this happened just one year before Jeff Gordon caused Clint Boyer the
1649840	1653320	championship at the same track and nearly started a riot.
1653320	1657120	After Vickers did the same thing to Kenseth, this is what Matt had to say.
1657120	1665160	That's just the kind of guy Matt was.
1665160	1667880	It was that hard to make him mad.
1667880	1673320	In 2013, Matt Kenseth departed from longtime team owner Jack Roush to race the 20 car for
1673320	1674800	Joe Gibbs Racing.
1674800	1679840	The driver he replaced was Joey Logano, who is far and away the most controversial driver
1679840	1681840	in the sport today.
1681840	1701800	There's just something about Logano that really rubs people the wrong way.
1701800	1706480	He was at one point the most highly touted NASCAR prospect ever, literally earning the
1706480	1709560	moniker of the greatest thing since sliced bread.
1709560	1713520	The immense amount of media hype surrounding his rise through the ranks made it tough to
1713520	1715480	root for the guy early on.
1715480	1720000	It didn't help that his racing style got on the nerves of many fans and drivers.
1720000	1724000	When you get right down to it, Joey Logano is a dirty driver.
1724000	1728040	When the chips are down, he will resort to cheap tactics if that's what it takes to
1728040	1729040	win.
1729040	1732240	He'll block someone with a huge run and risk wrecking the whole field.
1732240	1735760	He'll slam someone into the wall if he knows they're gonna pass him.
1735760	1740840	He'll move a 53-year-old Mark Martin out of the way rather than going through the inconvenience
1740840	1765640	of racing him clean for the win.
1765640	1770520	Being a recklessly inconsiderate driver isn't necessarily a bad thing, but the difference
1770520	1776020	between Logano and someone like Dale Earnhardt is that Joey doesn't own it in a cool way.
1776020	1780980	He still likes to carry himself as the innocent babyface who's never done anything wrong.
1780980	1785560	I'm sure that off the track, Joey Logano is a really great guy, but when he gets behind
1785560	1794200	the wheel, it's hard to find a driver less likable.
1794200	1798940	By 2015, the hatred for Joey Logano was reaching an all-time high.
1798940	1804180	He's having the best statistical season of his career and looks poised to take the championship.
1804180	1808920	One of his biggest challengers for the title is Matt Kenseth, who has won 5 races through
1808920	1811640	28 events, the most in the series.
1811640	1816480	In a playoff format where winning races is practically the only thing that matters, the
1816480	1823980	season's winningest driver has a pretty good shot to take the championship.
1823980	1826060	The drama begins at Charlotte.
1826060	1829600	Joey Logano wins, locking himself into the next round.
1829600	1834180	Matt Kenseth finishes almost dead last after wrecking early, putting himself in a virtual
1834180	1836140	must-win situation.
1836140	1839420	The next week at Kansas, he's looking to do just that.
1839420	1843660	He's dominated the race, leading more than half the laps in the event.
1843660	1848140	The only other driver who's been able to contend with him all day is Joey Logano.
1848140	1852420	Now let me reiterate here that Joey is locked in to the next round.
1852420	1856300	He has nothing to gain from challenging Matt Kenseth for the win.
1856300	1860080	It just doesn't make strategic sense to escalate things here.
1860080	1864780	But in this situation, Joey Logano's probably not thinking about strategy.
1864780	1869140	He's been around for a while now and knows that Matt's an easy target, a guy who got
1869140	1873340	pushed around for his whole career and never once did a damn thing about it.
1873340	1877160	Joey doesn't do what he does next because it's a smart racing move.
1877160	1879720	He does it because he knows he can get away with it.
1887720	1893320	Many modern NASCAR fans consider the 2015 season to be one of the worst in recent memory.
1893320	1898560	A combination of subpar racing, inconsistent meddling from the sanctioning body, and season-long
1898560	1903460	dominance from the sport's least popular drivers left most fans desperate for something
1903460	1905300	to be excited about.
1905300	1909900	Unfortunately for them, the following race would be the most miserable yet.
1909900	1914500	The race ended under dubious circumstances after Kevin Harvick wrecked the whole field
1914500	1916340	on the final restart.
1916340	1921140	Dale Jr. came gut-wrenchingly close to saving himself from elimination, but he never even
1921140	1923420	had a chance to race for the win.
1923420	1930180	As the caution flag flies, the sport's most popular driver is just edged out by Joey Logano.
1930180	1935260	Amidst the chaos and controversy, Matt Kenseth is quietly eliminated from his last great
1935260	1937660	shot at winning the championship.
1937660	1941040	In this moment, NASCAR is entering the dark timeline.
1941040	1943680	The fans have been beaten and broken down.
1943680	1948180	If they want to salvage any hope out of this season, they're going to need a hero.
1950980	1954340	You make decisions every day, you make decisions every minute behind a wheel.
1954340	1957820	To me, strategically, that doesn't seem like such a great decision for him.
1957820	1959780	But it's the one he made and that's how he wanted to win.
1961780	1963780	Oh, and it goes to 20!
1965780	1971780	And Kenseth, cleared by Logano, maybe no!
1984260	1989180	Statistically speaking, there's no doubt that Joey Logano was the best driver of the 2015
1989180	1990180	season.
1990180	1995000	In hindsight, it's difficult to imagine a scenario where he doesn't win the championship.
1995740	2000320	He would have to succumb to a cataclysmic event and a stupidly gimmicked points system.
2000320	2004940	Unfortunately for Joey, he was a victim of both, but only one of these things was out
2004940	2006440	of his control.
2006440	2011120	Joey Logano always wanted to have his cake and eat it too, and he would find out that
2011120	2014780	doing so is a quick way to end up with no cake at all.
2014780	2019020	Immediately afterwards, NASCAR suspended Matt Kenseth for two races.
2019020	2021220	Not that it really mattered at that point.
2021240	2026260	Joey Logano would go on to miss the championship race, and he learned an important lesson.
2026260	2030300	The problem with taking from someone when you have nothing to gain is that one day,
2030300	2033300	that person may wind up with nothing to lose.
2033300	2037060	Throughout his career, Matt Kenseth was never really a popular driver.
2037060	2040720	But in that moment, all of us were Matt Kenseth fans.
2040720	2045220	In a way, Matt Kenseth helped everyone get revenge on Joey Logano.
2045220	2052940	Well, unless you were a Logano fan.
2052940	2055060	But nobody really cares about them.
2060420	2063860	Revenge tells many different kinds of stories across racing.
2063860	2070380	Stories about greed, ego, respect, legacy, change, chaos, and justice.
2070380	2074700	These stories are all unique in their own right, but most of them end in the same way.
2074700	2078500	The story of revenge is ultimately a story of forgiveness.
2078500	2083100	Although revenge can provide us with some of the most captivating moments in auto racing,
2083100	2085580	there's a reason it's ultimately rare.
2085580	2090420	In NASCAR, vengeful vendettas inevitably leave behind a trail of wrecked race cars, poor
2090420	2092700	finishes and shattered dreams.
2092700	2095900	In the game of revenge, everybody loses.
2095900	2098620	Most drivers simply choose not to play.
2098620	2102800	So the next time you're on the road and feel like carrying out your own piece of revenge,
2102800	2124000	it's probably best to just turn the other cheek.
2124000	2129680	Hey everyone, Amp Media back again to bring you another fantastic toy review, as if the
2129680	2133360	downward spiral couldn't get low enough.
2133360	2139360	Today I'm pleased to announce that I've partnered with the fine people at U2's Collectible Figurines
2139360	2142560	to bring you the Emperor Lemon U2's.
2142560	2147320	So I work with U2's to design everything you see here, the figurine, the packages.
2147320	2151640	So go ahead and give them some of your hard earned cash, because a percentage of it goes
2151640	2153760	to me.
2153760	2159360	Hopefully I get enough royalties from this to cover the lawsuit from Disney.
2159360	2165520	But I do like this box, it has your colors, the green, the purple, the downward spiral.
2165520	2170820	They sculpted the tongue and teeth individually, that's a nice touch.
2170820	2173800	I can really be tasting the money with this one.
2173800	2179760	Yeah, I'm actually really impressed by the way that they make these, I mean this is kind
2179760	2182520	of cool because this is like your Avatar character.
2182520	2183520	Oh god, Avatar?
2183520	2186760	I'm going to get sued by Nickelodeon too?
2186760	2192240	But you know, you gotta love the attention to detail, it's even got a little mini downward
2192240	2194200	spiral on the microphone.
2194200	2198360	Do I have your disposable income now?
2198360	2202440	And keep in mind, this is a limited edition figure, meaning that once the initial run
2202440	2204640	is over, they're gone for good.
2204640	2211440	Wow, I guess there will never ever be another collectible figurine like this one.
2211440	2214480	Well you better get one while you still have a chance, because these are probably going
2214480	2216280	to go really fast I imagine.
2216800	2219800	These are going to go faster than I left the SOTY podcast.
2223680	2228480	So head out to the website and start hoarding these things like Fat Housewives on Walmart
2228480	2229480	on Black Friday.
2229480	2232280	Man, hopefully these will sell better than my NFTs.
2232280	2234280	Bruh, bruh, bruh, bruh, bruh.
2234280	2235280	Grand Jam!
2235280	2238280	Get down for Harambe.
2238280	2240560	I'm awfully glad for you.
2240560	2241560	How exciting.
2241840	2246960	I mean, it makes sense right, because having a U2's figurine validates you as an actual
2246960	2247960	public figure.
2247960	2251560	Of course, nobody knows who I am, so I mean why would they reach out to me?
2251560	2252760	That'd be ridiculous.
2252760	2256240	Why would U2's reach out to me and offer me a figurine?
2256240	2259160	I mean everyone else has one, even you have one.
2259160	2264360	Sorry Rusty, this is something only YouTubers with YouTubes can understand.
2271560	2275560	And just remember, he's going to have to run 42 laps or he's going to be close on fuel.
2275560	2277560	Boy, he's really slowing down too Larry.
2277560	2281560	I mean 28 looks to be like really closing up in a hurry now.
2281560	2286560	Two laps to go this time, Tony Stewart draws a bead on Terry Levani for third place.
2286560	2292560	I heard somebody say, and I think it was Naidu, that something was happening to the car.
2292560	2296560	Stewart makes the pass for third place on Bull's Center.
2296560	2298560	And it's over.
2298560	2299560	What happened?
