1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,640
When you're stuck in traffic, it's easy to lose your temper.

2
00:00:10,640 --> 00:00:15,620
Sometimes we encounter other drivers so insanely idiotic that they make us question who decided

3
00:00:15,620 --> 00:00:17,620
to give them a license.

4
00:00:17,620 --> 00:00:20,280
Driving this poorly should be a crime.

5
00:00:20,280 --> 00:00:23,480
Sometimes it is, and the problem elegantly solves itself.

6
00:00:23,480 --> 00:00:27,760
But most of the time, the idiot just gets away scot-free.

7
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:31,960
Not content with the unfairness of it all, a few of us will try to take justice into

8
00:00:31,960 --> 00:00:36,280
our own hands, often with less than fortunate results.

9
00:00:36,280 --> 00:00:46,360
Before you plan an act of road retribution, you may want to seek out wisdom from the experts.

10
00:00:46,360 --> 00:00:50,440
Motorsports feature the most talented drivers in the world, but they still succumb to the

11
00:00:50,440 --> 00:00:52,940
same emotions as the rest of us.

12
00:00:52,940 --> 00:00:57,420
With potentially millions of dollars on the line, patience on the racetrack runs very

13
00:00:57,420 --> 00:00:58,500
thin.

14
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:02,800
Auto racing provides a unique opportunity for drivers to destroy each other's vehicles

15
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:06,060
without any legal or financial repercussions.

16
00:01:06,060 --> 00:01:10,460
In series like NASCAR, the cars are durable enough to dish out some serious punishment

17
00:01:10,460 --> 00:01:12,880
without jeopardizing themselves.

18
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:16,140
Most racing accidents are just that, accidents.

19
00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:20,760
But in NASCAR, a few wrecks are not just intentional, but premeditated.

20
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:26,040
On track, the best drivers are just as skilled at retaliation as they are at racing.

21
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:34,720
Revenge in NASCAR comes in many forms, some more elegant than others.

22
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:38,880
The most proficient retaliators are discreet enough to make you think twice over whether

23
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:41,140
or not it was even on purpose.

24
00:01:41,140 --> 00:01:45,320
But by far the most entertaining revenge is the opposite of discreet.

25
00:01:45,320 --> 00:01:50,060
In this video, I'm going to talk about seven cases of revenge so outrageously blatant

26
00:01:50,060 --> 00:01:57,400
that nobody could see it as anything other than pure, unadulterated retribution.

27
00:01:57,400 --> 00:02:02,120
Our first tale comes from the winding turns of Sonoma, California, one of the few road

28
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:04,460
courses on the NASCAR schedule.

29
00:02:04,460 --> 00:02:08,500
These types of tracks give NASCAR drivers the opportunity to do something they rarely

30
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:13,340
ever get to do, turn right.

31
00:02:13,340 --> 00:02:18,340
And Sonoma's most eventful right turn is, without a doubt, turn 11, a tight hairpin

32
00:02:18,340 --> 00:02:24,460
that forces drivers to decelerate from 120 to 40 miles per hour in just a few seconds.

33
00:02:24,460 --> 00:02:31,620
In one race, two drivers are about to get very familiar with turn 11 and each other.

34
00:02:31,620 --> 00:02:35,620
It's lap 37 of the 2011 Toyota Save Mart 350.

35
00:02:35,620 --> 00:02:39,180
Tony Stewart has a fast car, but he's stuck back in traffic.

36
00:02:39,180 --> 00:02:44,140
Tony's getting a bit frustrated with Brian Vickers, who refuses to give up his position.

37
00:02:44,140 --> 00:02:50,900
By the time they reach turn 11, Tony has had enough and dumps him.

38
00:02:50,900 --> 00:02:54,860
During this time, Tony Stewart is one of the most formidable and aggressive drivers in

39
00:02:54,860 --> 00:02:56,060
the sport.

40
00:02:56,060 --> 00:03:00,900
If you raced him the wrong way, he would not hesitate to take you out of contention.

41
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:05,380
Over the years, dozens of drivers have fallen prey to Stewart's retaliation.

42
00:03:05,380 --> 00:03:09,120
And for a moment, Vickers looked to be yet another victim.

43
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:12,400
The race continues and Tony works his way through the pack.

44
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:18,000
By lap 85, he's cruising to a top-five finish when the broadcast cuts to commercial.

45
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:25,860
When they come back, Tony Stewart has been sent to the Shadow Realm.

46
00:03:25,860 --> 00:03:30,840
It took Brian Vickers more than 50 laps to get back to Stewart, and when he did, he sure

47
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:32,280
made the most of it.

48
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:37,000
Vickers hooked Tony at the precise speed and angle to strain him on the tire barrier, knocking

49
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
him out of the race entirely.

50
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:43,900
A well-orchestrated act of payback, but one that would ultimately prove inconsequential

51
00:03:43,900 --> 00:03:45,840
in the grand scheme of things.

52
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:50,000
Vickers may have won the battle that day, but it wouldn't stop Tony Stewart from eventually

53
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,700
winning his third and final cup championship that season.

54
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:57,960
At the very least though, Tony didn't wreck anyone else for a while after this.

55
00:03:57,960 --> 00:04:03,420
They say that revenge is a dish best served cold, and in NASCAR, some drivers prefer to

56
00:04:03,420 --> 00:04:06,420
bide their time before dishing out their payback.

57
00:04:06,420 --> 00:04:22,060
In the 2000s, Robbie Gordon was possibly the only NASCAR driver more aggressive than

58
00:04:22,060 --> 00:04:23,420
Tony Stewart.

59
00:04:23,420 --> 00:04:26,740
Robbie was the racing embodiment of chaos.

60
00:04:26,740 --> 00:04:31,100
His decisions on the racetrack seemed to be governed entirely by impulse.

61
00:04:31,100 --> 00:04:35,660
He would do things on the track that seemed completely pointless to anyone else but him.

62
00:04:35,660 --> 00:04:47,740
These loose cannon antics made him one of the most entertaining drivers to watch.

63
00:04:47,740 --> 00:04:58,180
He was the driver to boldly go where no other driver had gone before.

64
00:04:58,180 --> 00:05:02,720
Robbie Gordon was most well-known as one of NASCAR's best road course racers, but his

65
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:07,200
most bombastic moments would come at the Magic Mile in New Hampshire.

66
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:12,320
In 2001, Robbie would infamously score his first ever NASCAR victory there by moving

67
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:14,280
Jeff Gordon out of the way.

68
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:18,620
In the 2004 race, he would get spun by Greg Biffle and then hunt him back down like a

69
00:05:18,620 --> 00:05:23,380
heat-seeking missile, taking out two other championship contenders in the process.

70
00:05:23,380 --> 00:05:27,260
But believe it or not, this wasn't even the best example of Robbie getting revenge at

71
00:05:27,260 --> 00:05:28,660
New Hampshire.

72
00:05:28,660 --> 00:05:32,940
So based on what we've seen so far, it's generally a bad idea to piss off Robbie Gordon

73
00:05:32,940 --> 00:05:34,340
on the racetrack.

74
00:05:34,340 --> 00:05:39,100
In the 2005 Sylvania 300, Michael Waltrip did just that.

75
00:05:39,100 --> 00:05:43,500
By this season, Robbie Gordon had become fed up with answering to any team owner above

76
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:45,440
him, so he opened up his own team.

77
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:50,340
He would run the 2005 campaign as NASCAR's only owner driver.

78
00:05:50,340 --> 00:05:54,220
Financing your own race team comes with a lot of autonomy, but at the cost of a lot

79
00:05:54,220 --> 00:05:56,020
of, well, money.

80
00:05:56,020 --> 00:06:00,260
Any on-track mishaps would now have to come directly out of Robbie's own pocket.

81
00:06:00,260 --> 00:06:04,740
Considering his track record at that point, it was a pretty risky spot to be in.

82
00:06:04,740 --> 00:06:08,220
So how did Robbie do in his first year as his own boss?

83
00:06:08,220 --> 00:06:09,220
Pretty awful.

84
00:06:09,220 --> 00:06:14,060
By September, he has only won top 10 and has failed to qualify for four races.

85
00:06:14,060 --> 00:06:19,380
He's sitting a dreadful 36th in points, but he has a pretty decent run going at New Hampshire.

86
00:06:19,380 --> 00:06:23,820
That is until, while under caution, Michael Waltrip hooks him into the wall and totals

87
00:06:23,820 --> 00:06:25,060
his car.

88
00:06:25,100 --> 00:06:27,580
Needless to say, Robbie Gordon is not happy.

89
00:06:27,580 --> 00:06:33,500
About the 15, then he said, NASCAR, I hope you're listening, I will pay Michael Waltrip

90
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:34,500
back.

91
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:39,540
Robbie vows revenge against Michael, but after many months of inaction, everyone has pretty

92
00:06:39,540 --> 00:06:41,180
much forgotten about it.

93
00:06:41,180 --> 00:06:44,580
The following July, the Cup Series returns to New Hampshire.

94
00:06:44,580 --> 00:06:49,660
In 2006, Waltrip had become the co-owner of his own racing team, and just like Robbie

95
00:06:49,660 --> 00:06:51,500
the year before, he was struggling.

96
00:06:51,940 --> 00:06:56,780
Late in the race, Michael finds himself lined up behind who else but Robbie Gordon.

97
00:06:56,780 --> 00:07:00,580
Everyone else may have forgotten what happened the year prior, but Robbie sure hasn't.

98
00:07:00,580 --> 00:07:03,620
Our guys are trying to come back to us.

99
00:07:03,620 --> 00:07:04,620
How did that happen?

100
00:07:04,620 --> 00:07:07,020
He's crashed back there and broke into the radio.

101
00:07:07,020 --> 00:07:11,620
Robbie Gordon didn't have many victories in his NASCAR career, but when he did win,

102
00:07:11,620 --> 00:07:15,300
he made sure to do it in a way that was unmistakably his.

103
00:07:15,300 --> 00:07:19,440
Drivers like Robbie are all but extinct in NASCAR today, but back in the day, it was

104
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:23,280
common to see lots of drivers march to the beat of their own drum.

105
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:27,280
If you were looking for a driver to inspire excitement, then perhaps you'd find it in

106
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:29,360
Mr. Excitement, Jimmy Spencer.

107
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:32,360
It's going to be a drag race to the checkered flag!

108
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:34,400
Jimmy Spencer wins it!

109
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:39,160
Jimmy Spencer would get into a litany of fights and altercations over the course of his career,

110
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:42,660
but none was more heated than his feud with Kurt Busch.

111
00:07:42,660 --> 00:07:47,000
At the turn of the millennium, Kurt Busch was one of the fastest rising talents in the

112
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
sport.

113
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:52,580
In 1991, he was promoted to a full-time cup ride at just the age of 22.

114
00:07:52,580 --> 00:07:57,600
In his rookie season as NASCAR's newest phenom, Kurt Busch got rocked.

115
00:07:57,600 --> 00:08:01,740
He finished 27th in points with seven DNFs, and his biggest highlight of the year was

116
00:08:01,740 --> 00:08:05,000
being the last guy Dale Earnhardt ever flipped off.

117
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:10,160
It's tough being a rookie at NASCAR's highest level, a lesson Kurt learned in the 2001 Phoenix

118
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:14,320
race where he got turned by Jimmy Spencer in front of the entire field.

119
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:16,600
Welcome to the big leagues, kid.

120
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:20,880
At this point in time, Jimmy Spencer is in the opposite position of Kurt Busch.

121
00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:24,720
He's in the twilight of his career and his best days are long behind him.

122
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:30,400
But in the 2002 Food City 500 at Bristol, Jimmy Spencer has the opportunity to do something

123
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:35,080
he hasn't done in nearly eight years, win a cup series race.

124
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:38,860
He's running second with just 60 laps to go and reeling in the leader.

125
00:08:38,860 --> 00:08:42,980
The only problem is that the driver running first is the same guy Jimmy Spencer wrecked

126
00:08:42,980 --> 00:08:44,780
just five months earlier.

127
00:08:44,780 --> 00:08:47,260
Of course, Kurt doesn't cut Jimmy any slack.

128
00:08:57,760 --> 00:09:00,980
On this day, youth prevails over experience.

129
00:09:00,980 --> 00:09:05,420
After the race, however, Spencer ominously warns that the young driver still has much

130
00:09:05,420 --> 00:09:06,420
to learn.

131
00:09:06,420 --> 00:09:09,160
There's a lot of things you can and can't do, and one thing you can't do is just beat

132
00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:10,160
and bang with people.

133
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:13,660
And some guys have to learn, and they just have to learn the hard way.

134
00:09:13,660 --> 00:09:18,720
Five months later at Indianapolis, Spencer punted Busch at over 180 miles per hour.

135
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:23,280
He just booted him out of the way.

136
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:27,920
Kurt is absolutely livid and trashes Spencer in the post-wreck interview.

137
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:31,680
We spun and that put us in a bad position, back there with the decrepit old has-beens,

138
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:32,680
I guess.

139
00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:37,140
The feud continues to escalate until it reaches a boiling point in the next year's race at

140
00:09:37,140 --> 00:09:38,140
Michigan.

141
00:09:38,140 --> 00:09:41,700
Kurt swerves into Spencer trying to cut down one of his tires.

142
00:09:41,700 --> 00:09:45,220
After the race, Spencer reportedly marched over to Kurt's car and punched him in the

143
00:09:45,220 --> 00:09:46,220
face.

144
00:09:46,220 --> 00:09:52,020
Jimmy got out of the car, approached Kurt Busch, and actually punched Kurt Busch.

145
00:09:52,020 --> 00:09:56,440
Kurt left with a bloody nose and a chipped tooth, prompting NASCAR to suspend Jimmy Spencer

146
00:09:56,440 --> 00:09:57,860
for the next race.

147
00:09:57,860 --> 00:10:02,420
Now, at this point, it's important to recall that Jimmy Spencer has thus far demolished

148
00:10:02,420 --> 00:10:07,260
two of Kurt's race cars and his face, and the fans love him for it.

149
00:10:07,260 --> 00:10:11,960
The next race is littered with free Jimmy Spencer signs, and Mr. Excitement is arguably

150
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:14,300
the most popular he's ever been.

151
00:10:14,300 --> 00:10:19,440
Sometimes a NASCAR feud represents more than just a simple disagreement between drivers.

152
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:24,340
Kurt Busch and Jimmy Spencer symbolized a clash of generations in a changing sport.

153
00:10:24,340 --> 00:10:29,440
In the eyes of many fans at the time, Kurt Busch embodied a new wave of prima donna drivers

154
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:43,560
who lacked the struggle and grit of seasoned veterans like Jimmy Spencer.

155
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:47,700
Back in the day, drivers would settle disputes among themselves without any interference

156
00:10:47,700 --> 00:10:49,480
from the sanctioning body.

157
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:54,640
Many felt that NASCAR was babying down the sport to conform to a more mainstream image.

158
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:59,140
Too bad for them, NASCAR was entering a new age whether they were ready or not.

159
00:10:59,140 --> 00:11:03,820
Just one year afterwards, Kurt Busch would sit atop the sport as champion.

160
00:11:03,820 --> 00:11:08,820
Not long after that, Jimmy Spencer would retire and find a new home on the speed channel.

161
00:11:08,820 --> 00:11:13,120
While Kurt got the best of him in their time as competitors, Jimmy Spencer always finds

162
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:25,420
a way to have the last laugh.

163
00:11:25,420 --> 00:11:30,060
Despite starting off as polar opposite rivals, Kurt Busch and Jimmy Spencer didn't end

164
00:11:30,060 --> 00:11:32,080
up being so different after all.

165
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:34,060
NASCAR is always changing.

166
00:11:34,060 --> 00:11:49,980
Cry as you might, you can't stop the future.

167
00:11:49,980 --> 00:11:55,060
One of Kurt Busch's many career rivalries was a sibling rivalry with his brother Kyle.

168
00:11:55,060 --> 00:12:00,260
If Kurt was a can't miss talent, the younger Busch brother was a generational prodigy.

169
00:12:00,260 --> 00:12:05,460
While it took Kurt until age 23 to win in the cup series, Kyle did it at just 20 in

170
00:12:05,460 --> 00:12:06,740
his rookie season.

171
00:12:06,740 --> 00:12:10,540
Currently, he's in the conversation with Jeff Gordon and Jimmy Johnson as one of the

172
00:12:10,540 --> 00:12:13,420
greatest drivers of NASCAR's current era.

173
00:12:13,420 --> 00:12:18,700
In 2007, all three of these drivers raced on the same team, Hendrick Motorsports.

174
00:12:18,700 --> 00:12:23,540
Unfortunately, such great amassments of talent don't tend to stick around for very long.

175
00:12:23,540 --> 00:12:27,460
In the middle of the season, Kyle Busch wants out at Hendrick.

176
00:12:27,460 --> 00:12:32,040
Just like his brother, Kyle Busch had the tendency to lose his temper and had reportedly

177
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:35,260
worn out his welcome with team owner Rick Hendrick.

178
00:12:35,260 --> 00:12:39,260
Despite his skirmish with Kurt in the All-Star race, Kyle Busch's greatest rival wouldn't

179
00:12:39,260 --> 00:12:40,780
come from his brother.

180
00:12:40,780 --> 00:12:48,020
It would come from his replacement.

181
00:12:48,020 --> 00:12:52,500
By the mid-2000s, Dale Earnhardt Jr.'s race team was on a downward spiral, and he was

182
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:55,940
about to become the biggest free agent in all of NASCAR.

183
00:12:55,940 --> 00:13:00,940
As the sport's most popular star, Dale Jr. would provide an immediate boon to any team

184
00:13:00,940 --> 00:13:01,940
that signed him.

185
00:13:01,940 --> 00:13:05,980
Naturally, one of the first team owners to approach Jr. was Rick Hendrick.

186
00:13:05,980 --> 00:13:10,940
Beyond the appeal of joining NASCAR's most successful team, Jr. bonded with Rick Hendrick

187
00:13:10,940 --> 00:13:13,100
on a very personal level.

188
00:13:13,100 --> 00:13:17,300
Both had suffered tragic losses of family members earlier in the decade.

189
00:13:17,300 --> 00:13:22,380
With all that considered, Earnhardt and Hendrick were a match that seemed destined to happen.

190
00:13:22,380 --> 00:13:25,860
It's the 2007 Samsung 500 at Texas.

191
00:13:25,860 --> 00:13:31,140
On lap 252, Tony Stewart spins and Kyle Busch rear-ends Jr. in the scramble.

192
00:13:31,140 --> 00:13:34,180
Kyle thinks his car is total and retires from the race.

193
00:13:34,180 --> 00:13:37,980
Unbeknownst to him, however, his pit crew repairs the car and wants to send it back

194
00:13:37,980 --> 00:13:40,440
on track to pick up some extra points.

195
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:43,580
The only problem is that Kyle Busch has gone AWOL.

196
00:13:43,580 --> 00:13:48,140
The team scurries to find a replacement driver just as Dale Jr. is pulling his wrecked car

197
00:13:48,140 --> 00:13:49,720
into the garage.

198
00:13:49,720 --> 00:13:54,440
Long story short, Dale Jr. ended up finishing the race in Kyle Busch's car that day.

199
00:13:54,440 --> 00:14:03,040
And so today, it is with great honor to introduce my new boss for 2008, Mr. Rick Hendrick.

200
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:07,860
Was it a bizarre coincidence or perhaps a covert audition for his next ride?

201
00:14:07,860 --> 00:14:11,900
We may never know all the answers, but one thing's for sure, it wouldn't be the last

202
00:14:11,900 --> 00:14:18,760
incident involving Dale Jr. and Kyle Busch that season.

203
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:23,200
Six months later, Kyle Busch is in a fierce battle for the point lead heading into Kansas

204
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:26,140
while Jr. is out of championship contention.

205
00:14:26,140 --> 00:14:30,000
By this point, it's well known that Earnhardt will be replacing Kyle Busch at the end of

206
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:34,440
the season, but Kyle is still trying to make the most of his lame duck run by going out

207
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:35,720
with a bang.

208
00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:40,120
Just 30 laps in, however, Jr. runs over Kyle Busch on the backstretch and takes him out

209
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:41,120
of the race.

210
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:45,920
After it was over, Jr. apologized and said it was an accident, but Kyle Busch would not

211
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:59,320
so easily forget the driver who cost him his first shot at a championship.

212
00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:04,040
It's the spring of 2008, and Dale Jr. wants badly to win for his new team.

213
00:15:04,040 --> 00:15:07,200
He is currently in the midst of a 70-race winless streak.

214
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:12,360
Meanwhile, Kyle Busch is riding high in his new Joe Gibbs Racing Toyota, winning two of

215
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:14,580
the first nine races on the season.

216
00:15:14,580 --> 00:15:19,060
In the final laps at Richmond, Dale Jr. is just a few miles from victory.

217
00:15:19,060 --> 00:15:32,340
Kyle Busch, however, has other plans.

218
00:15:32,340 --> 00:15:36,820
One could say that the end of this race profoundly shaped the next few years in NASCAR.

219
00:15:36,820 --> 00:15:41,420
Kyle Busch finished 2008 with eight victories and was instantly rocketed to public enemy

220
00:15:41,420 --> 00:15:48,340
number one in the sport.

221
00:15:48,340 --> 00:15:53,300
For Dale Jr., the incident would mark the beginning of the worst stretch of his career.

222
00:15:53,300 --> 00:15:58,340
After 2008, Jr. would not see victory lane for the next three seasons.

223
00:15:58,340 --> 00:16:03,580
In some cases, revenge can end up having far more influence than just a petty comeuppance.

224
00:16:03,580 --> 00:16:06,380
It can go on to define a driver's legacy.

225
00:16:06,380 --> 00:16:11,100
This event cemented Kyle Busch as a dominant villain and Dale Jr. as a lovable underdog

226
00:16:11,100 --> 00:16:13,380
who could never seem to catch a break.

227
00:16:13,380 --> 00:16:17,060
Two perceptions that neither driver could ever really overcome.

228
00:16:17,060 --> 00:16:21,100
Do you think that if Dale and Kyle could go back to this moment, history could have turned

229
00:16:21,100 --> 00:16:22,100
out differently?

230
00:16:22,100 --> 00:16:30,140
Well, the next time they went to Richmond, history repeated itself instead.

231
00:16:30,140 --> 00:16:34,820
Revenge in NASCAR can greatly influence how we perceive other drivers, but very rarely

232
00:16:34,820 --> 00:16:50,940
does it influence the actual outcome of a season.

233
00:16:50,940 --> 00:16:56,900
In 2014, NASCAR introduced the controversial elimination-style playoff format, an unintended

234
00:16:56,900 --> 00:17:02,840
consequence of which was giving drivers tremendous leverage and potentially spoiling the competition.

235
00:17:02,840 --> 00:17:07,040
If you're going to have a feud in NASCAR, you absolutely do not want to start one of

236
00:17:07,040 --> 00:17:08,040
the playoffs.

237
00:17:08,040 --> 00:17:09,960
So let's talk about Martinsville.

238
00:17:09,960 --> 00:17:14,640
It's the oldest remaining track on the NASCAR schedule, which really shows from its unique

239
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:15,920
design.

240
00:17:15,920 --> 00:17:17,960
Remember Turn 11 from Sonoma?

241
00:17:17,960 --> 00:17:22,640
Well, double it back and that's basically the entire Martinsville racetrack.

242
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:26,740
Of course, the close quarters racing creates the perfect breeding ground for tempers to

243
00:17:26,740 --> 00:17:27,740
flare.

244
00:17:27,740 --> 00:17:31,960
With the added pressure of the playoffs, the fall Martinsville race turns the intensity

245
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:33,600
up to 11.

246
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:38,000
Denny Hamlin had always been one of NASCAR's most consistent drivers, but he could never

247
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,940
quite put it together when it counted most.

248
00:17:40,940 --> 00:17:44,660
Every time he found himself in position to contend for the championship, he would always

249
00:17:44,660 --> 00:17:47,680
end up suffering some inexplicable mishap.

250
00:17:47,680 --> 00:17:53,020
Heading into the 2017 playoff race at Martinsville, he's sitting sixth in points.

251
00:17:53,020 --> 00:17:57,400
If he wants to advance to the championship finale, he's going to have to catch a serious

252
00:17:57,400 --> 00:17:58,400
break.

253
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:01,280
Chase Elliott is in quite a different place than Denny.

254
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:05,920
He's not just looking for his first career championship, he's looking for his first career

255
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:06,920
win.

256
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:11,840
At age 21, he's in just his second full-time cup season, but the expectations surrounding

257
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:15,920
him are about as high as any other prospect the sport has ever seen.

258
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:18,800
Chase Elliott is a part of racing royalty.

259
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:23,360
The son of NASCAR legend Bill Elliott, he has spent the past half decade as NASCAR's

260
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:25,800
most anticipated young star.

261
00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:31,960
By 2017, he's next in line behind Dale Jr. as the sport's perennial most popular driver.

262
00:18:31,960 --> 00:18:36,800
But more than 70 races into his cup career, he still has yet to win at NASCAR's highest

263
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:37,800
level.

264
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:41,860
Today at Martinsville, Chase has a pretty good shot at finally breaking through to victory

265
00:18:41,860 --> 00:18:42,860
lane.

266
00:18:42,860 --> 00:18:47,000
Winning here wouldn't just validate the talent of the young phenom, it would punch his ticket

267
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,080
to the championship race.

268
00:18:49,080 --> 00:18:53,800
He's led over 100 laps so far, and with just four laps to go, he pulls ahead of the field

269
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:56,760
and looks to be cruising to a fairytale ending.

270
00:18:56,760 --> 00:19:01,640
Too bad for Chase, the driver behind him is Denny Hamlin, who is not about to let another

271
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:11,360
opportunity go to waste.

272
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:16,800
Chase Elliott did not win on this day, but luckily for our story, neither did Hamlin.

273
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:21,120
Denny swung for the fences in the closing laps of this race, but in doing so, he just

274
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:39,800
made himself the biggest target in NASCAR.

275
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:42,880
It's now one race before the championship finale.

276
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:47,320
In the closing laps, Denny Hamlin is holding on to the final transfer spot by the slimmest

277
00:19:47,320 --> 00:19:48,760
of margins.

278
00:19:48,760 --> 00:19:52,880
It was at this point that Chase Elliott taught Hamlin a lesson in why you should never mess

279
00:19:52,880 --> 00:20:15,800
with racing royalty.

280
00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:20,000
Believe it or not, this wasn't the first time the driver of the 24 car got revenge

281
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:32,760
at Phoenix for something that happened at Martinsville.

282
00:20:32,760 --> 00:20:37,560
Of course, the former driver of the 24 car was none other than Jeff Gordon, who was in

283
00:20:37,560 --> 00:20:41,200
the conversation for the greatest stock car driver ever.

284
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:46,400
In 1998, he drove the greatest statistical season in NASCAR's modern era, scoring an

285
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:49,580
unthinkable average finish of 5.7.

286
00:20:49,580 --> 00:20:53,700
His 2012 season, on the other hand, was not quite as spectacular.

287
00:20:53,700 --> 00:20:58,360
After the first five races, he is sitting a dismal 25th in the point standings.

288
00:20:58,360 --> 00:21:01,060
He's looking to turn his luck around at Martinsville.

289
00:21:01,060 --> 00:21:04,940
Winning here would have extra significance because at this point, Hendrick Motorsports

290
00:21:04,940 --> 00:21:07,520
is sitting at 199 wins.

291
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:11,400
Over the whole season, everyone has been wondering which Hendrick driver will take the honor

292
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:14,540
of scoring win number 200 for the team.

293
00:21:14,540 --> 00:21:19,360
So far, no Hendrick driver has won in 2012, but on this day, it certainly looks like it's

294
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:20,520
going to happen.

295
00:21:20,520 --> 00:21:25,260
With 10 laps to go, Jeff Gordon is in an amazing battle with his teammate Jimmy Johnson.

296
00:21:25,260 --> 00:21:30,040
So it looks like, barring a completely preposterous turn of events, that Rick Hendrick will get

297
00:21:30,040 --> 00:21:31,960
his 200th victory.

298
00:21:31,960 --> 00:21:36,480
Just as Gordon makes the pass on Johnson with five to go, the caution comes out.

299
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:40,720
For reasons we still don't understand to this day, David Rudiman doesn't come to

300
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:45,020
pit road during an obvious mechanical issue and stalls out on the front stretch.

301
00:21:45,020 --> 00:21:48,800
The field lines back up and the two Hendrick cars look to settle it on what should be the

302
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:50,240
final restart.

303
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:54,200
The only problem now is that they're on worn tires and are sitting ducks to the pack

304
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:56,400
behind them who pitted for fresh tires.

305
00:21:56,400 --> 00:22:02,020
Looks like the main possibly clamped Boyer in the 15 won the battle off pit road.

306
00:22:02,020 --> 00:22:04,080
That's the guy you better keep an eye on.

307
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:08,560
Well, the green flag drops and both Hendrick cars get a poor jump off the line.

308
00:22:08,560 --> 00:22:12,720
Simultaneously, Ryan Newman gives one of the biggest shelves in Martinsville history to

309
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:16,040
Clint Boyer, who's directly behind the Hendrick cars.

310
00:22:16,040 --> 00:22:20,440
With nowhere else to really go, Boyer makes the split second decision to dive bomb inside

311
00:22:20,440 --> 00:22:21,800
of Jeff Gordon.

312
00:22:21,800 --> 00:22:24,960
Three wide in a turn one at Martinsville.

313
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:26,960
This went about as well as you may have guessed.

314
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:28,960
Boyer shot, getting out of the triple!

315
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:29,960
Three wide, three wide!

316
00:22:29,960 --> 00:22:30,960
There goes Newman!

317
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:32,960
Newman's going to take the lead!

318
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:36,080
That was not pretty!

319
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:40,420
Clint Boyer was a driver who always seemed to be in the wrong place at the wrong time.

320
00:22:40,420 --> 00:22:45,360
He is perhaps best known for finishing the 07 Daytona 500 upside down.

321
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:49,640
He was still talented enough to occasionally win a race or two, but whenever Clint found

322
00:22:49,640 --> 00:22:52,800
success, misfortune always seemed to follow.

323
00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:55,940
The 2012 race at Martinsville is no exception.

324
00:22:55,940 --> 00:23:00,320
Looking back, it's hard to say Clint did anything wrong in this situation, but he still ended

325
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:02,160
up bearing the brunt of the controversy.

326
00:23:02,560 --> 00:23:05,720
Well, Clint and I are friends, you know, and I have a lot of respect for him.

327
00:23:05,720 --> 00:23:09,040
He's a great race car driver and I'm glad I talked to him before I talked to you guys

328
00:23:09,040 --> 00:23:10,880
because I was pretty mad at him.

329
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:13,400
After the race, Jeff Gordon is merciful.

330
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:17,680
Their next altercation, however, wouldn't be on such pleasant terms.

331
00:23:17,680 --> 00:23:21,760
Six months later, the Cup Series returns to Martinsville and the complexion of the season

332
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:23,440
looks very different.

333
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:27,460
With just four races left, the championship picture is wide open.

334
00:23:27,460 --> 00:23:31,720
After the worst start to a year he's ever had, Jeff Gordon has made a remarkable late

335
00:23:31,720 --> 00:23:35,720
season comeback to put himself within striking distance of the title.

336
00:23:35,720 --> 00:23:40,520
Right in the hunt with Gordon is Clint Boyer, who is having the season of his life.

337
00:23:40,520 --> 00:23:44,680
Late in the race at Martinsville, the two make contact in a hard-fought side-by-side

338
00:23:44,680 --> 00:23:45,680
battle.

339
00:23:45,680 --> 00:23:48,160
This time, Jeff Gordon is not as forgiving.

340
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:54,640
After a second run-in on the season, Clint Boyer is skating on thin ice.

341
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:58,680
Two weeks later at Phoenix, Clint Boyer is closer to the championship than he's ever

342
00:23:58,680 --> 00:23:59,680
been.

343
00:23:59,680 --> 00:24:03,720
Late in the day, he's running in the top 5 and is less than 30 points behind the championship

344
00:24:03,720 --> 00:24:04,720
leader.

345
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:08,560
It's at this moment when Boyer runs into who else but Jeff Gordon.

346
00:24:08,560 --> 00:24:24,160
Unfortunately for Boyer, this is the straw that broke the camel's back.

347
00:24:24,160 --> 00:24:28,240
It's still surreal watching this back today nearly a decade afterwards.

348
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:32,760
Jeff Gordon hunted down Boyer like a dog and erased his championship hopes in one flick

349
00:24:32,760 --> 00:24:34,280
of the steering wheel.

350
00:24:34,280 --> 00:24:38,880
What ensued was possibly the biggest melee in the history of NASCAR, but for as many

351
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:42,840
punches that were thrown that day, it didn't change the outcome.

352
00:24:42,840 --> 00:24:46,920
Clint Boyer would go on to lose the championship by just 39 points.

353
00:24:46,920 --> 00:24:51,560
If Gordon doesn't take him out, it's very possible he could have won the whole thing.

354
00:24:51,560 --> 00:24:55,560
Boyer would never again come as close to winning a cup series title.

355
00:24:55,560 --> 00:24:57,680
Jeff Gordon is a racing god.

356
00:24:57,680 --> 00:25:00,400
He can give and he can take away.

357
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:05,560
It's hard to imagine a moment in NASCAR more savage than Gordon's revenge on Clint Boyer,

358
00:25:05,560 --> 00:25:10,420
but believe it or not, there is one incident that tops it, mostly because it came from

359
00:25:10,420 --> 00:25:22,240
such an unlikely source.

360
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:26,720
If I could use one word to describe Matt Kenseth's career in NASCAR, it would be

361
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:27,860
overshadowed.

362
00:25:27,860 --> 00:25:32,700
If you asked fans to list off the best drivers of the 21st century, many of them would probably

363
00:25:32,700 --> 00:25:34,480
forget to mention him.

364
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:39,720
In 2003, he put together one of the most dominant seasons in recent memory, only to have it

365
00:25:39,720 --> 00:25:43,480
continually discredited because he only won a single race.

366
00:25:43,480 --> 00:25:48,340
Many have inferred that Kenseth's 2003 season directly persuaded NASCAR to overhaul the

367
00:25:48,340 --> 00:25:53,860
entire championship format to make sure that a performance like it could never happen again.

368
00:25:53,860 --> 00:25:58,000
So what exactly is the problem with a guy like Matt Kenseth nearly leading the points

369
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:59,000
wire-to-wire?

370
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:04,060
Well, the thing is that Matt Kenseth was not exactly the most exciting driver.

371
00:26:04,060 --> 00:26:09,020
He had a rather milquetoast personality which many considered to be downright boring to

372
00:26:09,020 --> 00:26:13,300
watch, but Matt's relative non-intrigue served more as a testament to how good he

373
00:26:13,300 --> 00:26:15,240
was at staying out of trouble.

374
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:19,740
He always played it cool with the media and avoided drama like the plague.

375
00:26:19,740 --> 00:26:23,900
On track, he was one of the cleanest and most respectful drivers out there.

376
00:26:23,900 --> 00:26:28,780
It was really difficult to recall any examples of Matt Kenseth intentionally wrecking someone

377
00:26:28,780 --> 00:26:29,980
in a race.

378
00:26:29,980 --> 00:26:34,600
On the very few occasions he did end up in an altercation, he always seemed to take much

379
00:26:34,600 --> 00:26:37,000
more punishment than he dished out.

380
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:39,640
So remember Brian Vickers from Chapter 1?

381
00:26:39,640 --> 00:26:44,360
Well, getting revenge on Tony Stewart must have awoken some kind of demon within him,

382
00:26:44,360 --> 00:26:48,960
because later that season at Martinsville, Vickers went on possibly the biggest rampage

383
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:50,640
in NASCAR history.

384
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:55,860
Throughout the race, Vickers takes out Regan Smith, Montoya, Jamie McMurray, and then starts

385
00:26:55,860 --> 00:27:00,400
beating and banging on Matt Kenseth, who at that moment is battling for the championship

386
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:01,400
lead.

387
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:05,560
Kenseth tries to put an end to Vickers reign of terror by punting him out of the way, but

388
00:27:05,560 --> 00:27:08,840
that only makes him the sole target of the wrath.

389
00:27:08,840 --> 00:27:12,920
Just a few laps later, Vickers plows into the back of Kenseth, who goes on to finish

390
00:27:12,920 --> 00:27:14,920
outside of the top 30.

391
00:27:14,920 --> 00:27:19,240
Not content with just one act of vengeance, however, Vickers would take out Kenseth again

392
00:27:19,240 --> 00:27:21,400
two weeks later at Phoenix.

393
00:27:21,400 --> 00:27:25,840
Needless to say, Matt Kenseth didn't end up winning the championship this season.

394
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:29,840
Keep in mind, this happened just one year before Jeff Gordon caused Clint Boyer the

395
00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:33,320
championship at the same track and nearly started a riot.

396
00:27:33,320 --> 00:27:37,120
After Vickers did the same thing to Kenseth, this is what Matt had to say.

397
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:45,160
That's just the kind of guy Matt was.

398
00:27:45,160 --> 00:27:47,880
It was that hard to make him mad.

399
00:27:47,880 --> 00:27:53,320
In 2013, Matt Kenseth departed from longtime team owner Jack Roush to race the 20 car for

400
00:27:53,320 --> 00:27:54,800
Joe Gibbs Racing.

401
00:27:54,800 --> 00:27:59,840
The driver he replaced was Joey Logano, who is far and away the most controversial driver

402
00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:01,840
in the sport today.

403
00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:21,800
There's just something about Logano that really rubs people the wrong way.

404
00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:26,480
He was at one point the most highly touted NASCAR prospect ever, literally earning the

405
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:29,560
moniker of the greatest thing since sliced bread.

406
00:28:29,560 --> 00:28:33,520
The immense amount of media hype surrounding his rise through the ranks made it tough to

407
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:35,480
root for the guy early on.

408
00:28:35,480 --> 00:28:40,000
It didn't help that his racing style got on the nerves of many fans and drivers.

409
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:44,000
When you get right down to it, Joey Logano is a dirty driver.

410
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:48,040
When the chips are down, he will resort to cheap tactics if that's what it takes to

411
00:28:48,040 --> 00:28:49,040
win.

412
00:28:49,040 --> 00:28:52,240
He'll block someone with a huge run and risk wrecking the whole field.

413
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:55,760
He'll slam someone into the wall if he knows they're gonna pass him.

414
00:28:55,760 --> 00:29:00,840
He'll move a 53-year-old Mark Martin out of the way rather than going through the inconvenience

415
00:29:00,840 --> 00:29:25,640
of racing him clean for the win.

416
00:29:25,640 --> 00:29:30,520
Being a recklessly inconsiderate driver isn't necessarily a bad thing, but the difference

417
00:29:30,520 --> 00:29:36,020
between Logano and someone like Dale Earnhardt is that Joey doesn't own it in a cool way.

418
00:29:36,020 --> 00:29:40,980
He still likes to carry himself as the innocent babyface who's never done anything wrong.

419
00:29:40,980 --> 00:29:45,560
I'm sure that off the track, Joey Logano is a really great guy, but when he gets behind

420
00:29:45,560 --> 00:29:54,200
the wheel, it's hard to find a driver less likable.

421
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:58,940
By 2015, the hatred for Joey Logano was reaching an all-time high.

422
00:29:58,940 --> 00:30:04,180
He's having the best statistical season of his career and looks poised to take the championship.

423
00:30:04,180 --> 00:30:08,920
One of his biggest challengers for the title is Matt Kenseth, who has won 5 races through

424
00:30:08,920 --> 00:30:11,640
28 events, the most in the series.

425
00:30:11,640 --> 00:30:16,480
In a playoff format where winning races is practically the only thing that matters, the

426
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:23,980
season's winningest driver has a pretty good shot to take the championship.

427
00:30:23,980 --> 00:30:26,060
The drama begins at Charlotte.

428
00:30:26,060 --> 00:30:29,600
Joey Logano wins, locking himself into the next round.

429
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:34,180
Matt Kenseth finishes almost dead last after wrecking early, putting himself in a virtual

430
00:30:34,180 --> 00:30:36,140
must-win situation.

431
00:30:36,140 --> 00:30:39,420
The next week at Kansas, he's looking to do just that.

432
00:30:39,420 --> 00:30:43,660
He's dominated the race, leading more than half the laps in the event.

433
00:30:43,660 --> 00:30:48,140
The only other driver who's been able to contend with him all day is Joey Logano.

434
00:30:48,140 --> 00:30:52,420
Now let me reiterate here that Joey is locked in to the next round.

435
00:30:52,420 --> 00:30:56,300
He has nothing to gain from challenging Matt Kenseth for the win.

436
00:30:56,300 --> 00:31:00,080
It just doesn't make strategic sense to escalate things here.

437
00:31:00,080 --> 00:31:04,780
But in this situation, Joey Logano's probably not thinking about strategy.

438
00:31:04,780 --> 00:31:09,140
He's been around for a while now and knows that Matt's an easy target, a guy who got

439
00:31:09,140 --> 00:31:13,340
pushed around for his whole career and never once did a damn thing about it.

440
00:31:13,340 --> 00:31:17,160
Joey doesn't do what he does next because it's a smart racing move.

441
00:31:17,160 --> 00:31:19,720
He does it because he knows he can get away with it.

442
00:31:27,720 --> 00:31:33,320
Many modern NASCAR fans consider the 2015 season to be one of the worst in recent memory.

443
00:31:33,320 --> 00:31:38,560
A combination of subpar racing, inconsistent meddling from the sanctioning body, and season-long

444
00:31:38,560 --> 00:31:43,460
dominance from the sport's least popular drivers left most fans desperate for something

445
00:31:43,460 --> 00:31:45,300
to be excited about.

446
00:31:45,300 --> 00:31:49,900
Unfortunately for them, the following race would be the most miserable yet.

447
00:31:49,900 --> 00:31:54,500
The race ended under dubious circumstances after Kevin Harvick wrecked the whole field

448
00:31:54,500 --> 00:31:56,340
on the final restart.

449
00:31:56,340 --> 00:32:01,140
Dale Jr. came gut-wrenchingly close to saving himself from elimination, but he never even

450
00:32:01,140 --> 00:32:03,420
had a chance to race for the win.

451
00:32:03,420 --> 00:32:10,180
As the caution flag flies, the sport's most popular driver is just edged out by Joey Logano.

452
00:32:10,180 --> 00:32:15,260
Amidst the chaos and controversy, Matt Kenseth is quietly eliminated from his last great

453
00:32:15,260 --> 00:32:17,660
shot at winning the championship.

454
00:32:17,660 --> 00:32:21,040
In this moment, NASCAR is entering the dark timeline.

455
00:32:21,040 --> 00:32:23,680
The fans have been beaten and broken down.

456
00:32:23,680 --> 00:32:28,180
If they want to salvage any hope out of this season, they're going to need a hero.

457
00:32:30,980 --> 00:32:34,340
You make decisions every day, you make decisions every minute behind a wheel.

458
00:32:34,340 --> 00:32:37,820
To me, strategically, that doesn't seem like such a great decision for him.

459
00:32:37,820 --> 00:32:39,780
But it's the one he made and that's how he wanted to win.

460
00:32:41,780 --> 00:32:43,780
Oh, and it goes to 20!

461
00:32:45,780 --> 00:32:51,780
And Kenseth, cleared by Logano, maybe no!

462
00:33:04,260 --> 00:33:09,180
Statistically speaking, there's no doubt that Joey Logano was the best driver of the 2015

463
00:33:09,180 --> 00:33:10,180
season.

464
00:33:10,180 --> 00:33:15,000
In hindsight, it's difficult to imagine a scenario where he doesn't win the championship.

465
00:33:15,740 --> 00:33:20,320
He would have to succumb to a cataclysmic event and a stupidly gimmicked points system.

466
00:33:20,320 --> 00:33:24,940
Unfortunately for Joey, he was a victim of both, but only one of these things was out

467
00:33:24,940 --> 00:33:26,440
of his control.

468
00:33:26,440 --> 00:33:31,120
Joey Logano always wanted to have his cake and eat it too, and he would find out that

469
00:33:31,120 --> 00:33:34,780
doing so is a quick way to end up with no cake at all.

470
00:33:34,780 --> 00:33:39,020
Immediately afterwards, NASCAR suspended Matt Kenseth for two races.

471
00:33:39,020 --> 00:33:41,220
Not that it really mattered at that point.

472
00:33:41,240 --> 00:33:46,260
Joey Logano would go on to miss the championship race, and he learned an important lesson.

473
00:33:46,260 --> 00:33:50,300
The problem with taking from someone when you have nothing to gain is that one day,

474
00:33:50,300 --> 00:33:53,300
that person may wind up with nothing to lose.

475
00:33:53,300 --> 00:33:57,060
Throughout his career, Matt Kenseth was never really a popular driver.

476
00:33:57,060 --> 00:34:00,720
But in that moment, all of us were Matt Kenseth fans.

477
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:05,220
In a way, Matt Kenseth helped everyone get revenge on Joey Logano.

478
00:34:05,220 --> 00:34:12,940
Well, unless you were a Logano fan.

479
00:34:12,940 --> 00:34:15,060
But nobody really cares about them.

480
00:34:20,420 --> 00:34:23,860
Revenge tells many different kinds of stories across racing.

481
00:34:23,860 --> 00:34:30,380
Stories about greed, ego, respect, legacy, change, chaos, and justice.

482
00:34:30,380 --> 00:34:34,700
These stories are all unique in their own right, but most of them end in the same way.

483
00:34:34,700 --> 00:34:38,500
The story of revenge is ultimately a story of forgiveness.

484
00:34:38,500 --> 00:34:43,100
Although revenge can provide us with some of the most captivating moments in auto racing,

485
00:34:43,100 --> 00:34:45,580
there's a reason it's ultimately rare.

486
00:34:45,580 --> 00:34:50,420
In NASCAR, vengeful vendettas inevitably leave behind a trail of wrecked race cars, poor

487
00:34:50,420 --> 00:34:52,700
finishes and shattered dreams.

488
00:34:52,700 --> 00:34:55,900
In the game of revenge, everybody loses.

489
00:34:55,900 --> 00:34:58,620
Most drivers simply choose not to play.

490
00:34:58,620 --> 00:35:02,800
So the next time you're on the road and feel like carrying out your own piece of revenge,

491
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:24,000
it's probably best to just turn the other cheek.

492
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:29,680
Hey everyone, Amp Media back again to bring you another fantastic toy review, as if the

493
00:35:29,680 --> 00:35:33,360
downward spiral couldn't get low enough.

494
00:35:33,360 --> 00:35:39,360
Today I'm pleased to announce that I've partnered with the fine people at U2's Collectible Figurines

495
00:35:39,360 --> 00:35:42,560
to bring you the Emperor Lemon U2's.

496
00:35:42,560 --> 00:35:47,320
So I work with U2's to design everything you see here, the figurine, the packages.

497
00:35:47,320 --> 00:35:51,640
So go ahead and give them some of your hard earned cash, because a percentage of it goes

498
00:35:51,640 --> 00:35:53,760
to me.

499
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:59,360
Hopefully I get enough royalties from this to cover the lawsuit from Disney.

500
00:35:59,360 --> 00:36:05,520
But I do like this box, it has your colors, the green, the purple, the downward spiral.

501
00:36:05,520 --> 00:36:10,820
They sculpted the tongue and teeth individually, that's a nice touch.

502
00:36:10,820 --> 00:36:13,800
I can really be tasting the money with this one.

503
00:36:13,800 --> 00:36:19,760
Yeah, I'm actually really impressed by the way that they make these, I mean this is kind

504
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:22,520
of cool because this is like your Avatar character.

505
00:36:22,520 --> 00:36:23,520
Oh god, Avatar?

506
00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:26,760
I'm going to get sued by Nickelodeon too?

507
00:36:26,760 --> 00:36:32,240
But you know, you gotta love the attention to detail, it's even got a little mini downward

508
00:36:32,240 --> 00:36:34,200
spiral on the microphone.

509
00:36:34,200 --> 00:36:38,360
Do I have your disposable income now?

510
00:36:38,360 --> 00:36:42,440
And keep in mind, this is a limited edition figure, meaning that once the initial run

511
00:36:42,440 --> 00:36:44,640
is over, they're gone for good.

512
00:36:44,640 --> 00:36:51,440
Wow, I guess there will never ever be another collectible figurine like this one.

513
00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:54,480
Well you better get one while you still have a chance, because these are probably going

514
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:56,280
to go really fast I imagine.

515
00:36:56,800 --> 00:36:59,800
These are going to go faster than I left the SOTY podcast.

516
00:37:03,680 --> 00:37:08,480
So head out to the website and start hoarding these things like Fat Housewives on Walmart

517
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:09,480
on Black Friday.

518
00:37:09,480 --> 00:37:12,280
Man, hopefully these will sell better than my NFTs.

519
00:37:12,280 --> 00:37:14,280
Bruh, bruh, bruh, bruh, bruh.

520
00:37:14,280 --> 00:37:15,280
Grand Jam!

521
00:37:15,280 --> 00:37:18,280
Get down for Harambe.

522
00:37:18,280 --> 00:37:20,560
I'm awfully glad for you.

523
00:37:20,560 --> 00:37:21,560
How exciting.

524
00:37:21,840 --> 00:37:26,960
I mean, it makes sense right, because having a U2's figurine validates you as an actual

525
00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:27,960
public figure.

526
00:37:27,960 --> 00:37:31,560
Of course, nobody knows who I am, so I mean why would they reach out to me?

527
00:37:31,560 --> 00:37:32,760
That'd be ridiculous.

528
00:37:32,760 --> 00:37:36,240
Why would U2's reach out to me and offer me a figurine?

529
00:37:36,240 --> 00:37:39,160
I mean everyone else has one, even you have one.

530
00:37:39,160 --> 00:37:44,360
Sorry Rusty, this is something only YouTubers with YouTubes can understand.

531
00:37:51,560 --> 00:37:55,560
And just remember, he's going to have to run 42 laps or he's going to be close on fuel.

532
00:37:55,560 --> 00:37:57,560
Boy, he's really slowing down too Larry.

533
00:37:57,560 --> 00:38:01,560
I mean 28 looks to be like really closing up in a hurry now.

534
00:38:01,560 --> 00:38:06,560
Two laps to go this time, Tony Stewart draws a bead on Terry Levani for third place.

535
00:38:06,560 --> 00:38:12,560
I heard somebody say, and I think it was Naidu, that something was happening to the car.

536
00:38:12,560 --> 00:38:16,560
Stewart makes the pass for third place on Bull's Center.

537
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:18,560
And it's over.

538
00:38:18,560 --> 00:38:19,560
What happened?
