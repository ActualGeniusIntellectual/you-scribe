00:00.000 --> 00:10.640
When you're stuck in traffic, it's easy to lose your temper.

00:10.640 --> 00:15.620
Sometimes we encounter other drivers so insanely idiotic that they make us question who decided

00:15.620 --> 00:17.620
to give them a license.

00:17.620 --> 00:20.280
Driving this poorly should be a crime.

00:20.280 --> 00:23.480
Sometimes it is, and the problem elegantly solves itself.

00:23.480 --> 00:27.760
But most of the time, the idiot just gets away scot-free.

00:27.760 --> 00:31.960
Not content with the unfairness of it all, a few of us will try to take justice into

00:31.960 --> 00:36.280
our own hands, often with less than fortunate results.

00:36.280 --> 00:46.360
Before you plan an act of road retribution, you may want to seek out wisdom from the experts.

00:46.360 --> 00:50.440
Motorsports feature the most talented drivers in the world, but they still succumb to the

00:50.440 --> 00:52.940
same emotions as the rest of us.

00:52.940 --> 00:57.420
With potentially millions of dollars on the line, patience on the racetrack runs very

00:57.420 --> 00:58.500
thin.

00:58.500 --> 01:02.800
Auto racing provides a unique opportunity for drivers to destroy each other's vehicles

01:02.800 --> 01:06.060
without any legal or financial repercussions.

01:06.060 --> 01:10.460
In series like NASCAR, the cars are durable enough to dish out some serious punishment

01:10.460 --> 01:12.880
without jeopardizing themselves.

01:12.880 --> 01:16.140
Most racing accidents are just that, accidents.

01:16.140 --> 01:20.760
But in NASCAR, a few wrecks are not just intentional, but premeditated.

01:20.760 --> 01:26.040
On track, the best drivers are just as skilled at retaliation as they are at racing.

01:26.040 --> 01:34.720
Revenge in NASCAR comes in many forms, some more elegant than others.

01:34.720 --> 01:38.880
The most proficient retaliators are discreet enough to make you think twice over whether

01:38.880 --> 01:41.140
or not it was even on purpose.

01:41.140 --> 01:45.320
But by far the most entertaining revenge is the opposite of discreet.

01:45.320 --> 01:50.060
In this video, I'm going to talk about seven cases of revenge so outrageously blatant

01:50.060 --> 01:57.400
that nobody could see it as anything other than pure, unadulterated retribution.

01:57.400 --> 02:02.120
Our first tale comes from the winding turns of Sonoma, California, one of the few road

02:02.120 --> 02:04.460
courses on the NASCAR schedule.

02:04.460 --> 02:08.500
These types of tracks give NASCAR drivers the opportunity to do something they rarely

02:08.500 --> 02:13.340
ever get to do, turn right.

02:13.340 --> 02:18.340
And Sonoma's most eventful right turn is, without a doubt, turn 11, a tight hairpin

02:18.340 --> 02:24.460
that forces drivers to decelerate from 120 to 40 miles per hour in just a few seconds.

02:24.460 --> 02:31.620
In one race, two drivers are about to get very familiar with turn 11 and each other.

02:31.620 --> 02:35.620
It's lap 37 of the 2011 Toyota Save Mart 350.

02:35.620 --> 02:39.180
Tony Stewart has a fast car, but he's stuck back in traffic.

02:39.180 --> 02:44.140
Tony's getting a bit frustrated with Brian Vickers, who refuses to give up his position.

02:44.140 --> 02:50.900
By the time they reach turn 11, Tony has had enough and dumps him.

02:50.900 --> 02:54.860
During this time, Tony Stewart is one of the most formidable and aggressive drivers in

02:54.860 --> 02:56.060
the sport.

02:56.060 --> 03:00.900
If you raced him the wrong way, he would not hesitate to take you out of contention.

03:00.900 --> 03:05.380
Over the years, dozens of drivers have fallen prey to Stewart's retaliation.

03:05.380 --> 03:09.120
And for a moment, Vickers looked to be yet another victim.

03:09.120 --> 03:12.400
The race continues and Tony works his way through the pack.

03:12.400 --> 03:18.000
By lap 85, he's cruising to a top-five finish when the broadcast cuts to commercial.

03:18.000 --> 03:25.860
When they come back, Tony Stewart has been sent to the Shadow Realm.

03:25.860 --> 03:30.840
It took Brian Vickers more than 50 laps to get back to Stewart, and when he did, he sure

03:30.840 --> 03:32.280
made the most of it.

03:32.280 --> 03:37.000
Vickers hooked Tony at the precise speed and angle to strain him on the tire barrier, knocking

03:37.000 --> 03:39.000
him out of the race entirely.

03:39.000 --> 03:43.900
A well-orchestrated act of payback, but one that would ultimately prove inconsequential

03:43.900 --> 03:45.840
in the grand scheme of things.

03:45.840 --> 03:50.000
Vickers may have won the battle that day, but it wouldn't stop Tony Stewart from eventually

03:50.000 --> 03:53.700
winning his third and final cup championship that season.

03:53.700 --> 03:57.960
At the very least though, Tony didn't wreck anyone else for a while after this.

03:57.960 --> 04:03.420
They say that revenge is a dish best served cold, and in NASCAR, some drivers prefer to

04:03.420 --> 04:06.420
bide their time before dishing out their payback.

04:06.420 --> 04:22.060
In the 2000s, Robbie Gordon was possibly the only NASCAR driver more aggressive than

04:22.060 --> 04:23.420
Tony Stewart.

04:23.420 --> 04:26.740
Robbie was the racing embodiment of chaos.

04:26.740 --> 04:31.100
His decisions on the racetrack seemed to be governed entirely by impulse.

04:31.100 --> 04:35.660
He would do things on the track that seemed completely pointless to anyone else but him.

04:35.660 --> 04:47.740
These loose cannon antics made him one of the most entertaining drivers to watch.

04:47.740 --> 04:58.180
He was the driver to boldly go where no other driver had gone before.

04:58.180 --> 05:02.720
Robbie Gordon was most well-known as one of NASCAR's best road course racers, but his

05:02.720 --> 05:07.200
most bombastic moments would come at the Magic Mile in New Hampshire.

05:07.200 --> 05:12.320
In 2001, Robbie would infamously score his first ever NASCAR victory there by moving

05:12.320 --> 05:14.280
Jeff Gordon out of the way.

05:14.280 --> 05:18.620
In the 2004 race, he would get spun by Greg Biffle and then hunt him back down like a

05:18.620 --> 05:23.380
heat-seeking missile, taking out two other championship contenders in the process.

05:23.380 --> 05:27.260
But believe it or not, this wasn't even the best example of Robbie getting revenge at

05:27.260 --> 05:28.660
New Hampshire.

05:28.660 --> 05:32.940
So based on what we've seen so far, it's generally a bad idea to piss off Robbie Gordon

05:32.940 --> 05:34.340
on the racetrack.

05:34.340 --> 05:39.100
In the 2005 Sylvania 300, Michael Waltrip did just that.

05:39.100 --> 05:43.500
By this season, Robbie Gordon had become fed up with answering to any team owner above

05:43.500 --> 05:45.440
him, so he opened up his own team.

05:45.440 --> 05:50.340
He would run the 2005 campaign as NASCAR's only owner driver.

05:50.340 --> 05:54.220
Financing your own race team comes with a lot of autonomy, but at the cost of a lot

05:54.220 --> 05:56.020
of, well, money.

05:56.020 --> 06:00.260
Any on-track mishaps would now have to come directly out of Robbie's own pocket.

06:00.260 --> 06:04.740
Considering his track record at that point, it was a pretty risky spot to be in.

06:04.740 --> 06:08.220
So how did Robbie do in his first year as his own boss?

06:08.220 --> 06:09.220
Pretty awful.

06:09.220 --> 06:14.060
By September, he has only won top 10 and has failed to qualify for four races.

06:14.060 --> 06:19.380
He's sitting a dreadful 36th in points, but he has a pretty decent run going at New Hampshire.

06:19.380 --> 06:23.820
That is until, while under caution, Michael Waltrip hooks him into the wall and totals

06:23.820 --> 06:25.060
his car.

06:25.100 --> 06:27.580
Needless to say, Robbie Gordon is not happy.

06:27.580 --> 06:33.500
About the 15, then he said, NASCAR, I hope you're listening, I will pay Michael Waltrip

06:33.500 --> 06:34.500
back.

06:34.500 --> 06:39.540
Robbie vows revenge against Michael, but after many months of inaction, everyone has pretty

06:39.540 --> 06:41.180
much forgotten about it.

06:41.180 --> 06:44.580
The following July, the Cup Series returns to New Hampshire.

06:44.580 --> 06:49.660
In 2006, Waltrip had become the co-owner of his own racing team, and just like Robbie

06:49.660 --> 06:51.500
the year before, he was struggling.

06:51.940 --> 06:56.780
Late in the race, Michael finds himself lined up behind who else but Robbie Gordon.

06:56.780 --> 07:00.580
Everyone else may have forgotten what happened the year prior, but Robbie sure hasn't.

07:00.580 --> 07:03.620
Our guys are trying to come back to us.

07:03.620 --> 07:04.620
How did that happen?

07:04.620 --> 07:07.020
He's crashed back there and broke into the radio.

07:07.020 --> 07:11.620
Robbie Gordon didn't have many victories in his NASCAR career, but when he did win,

07:11.620 --> 07:15.300
he made sure to do it in a way that was unmistakably his.

07:15.300 --> 07:19.440
Drivers like Robbie are all but extinct in NASCAR today, but back in the day, it was

07:19.480 --> 07:23.280
common to see lots of drivers march to the beat of their own drum.

07:23.280 --> 07:27.280
If you were looking for a driver to inspire excitement, then perhaps you'd find it in

07:27.280 --> 07:29.360
Mr. Excitement, Jimmy Spencer.

07:29.360 --> 07:32.360
It's going to be a drag race to the checkered flag!

07:32.360 --> 07:34.400
Jimmy Spencer wins it!

07:34.400 --> 07:39.160
Jimmy Spencer would get into a litany of fights and altercations over the course of his career,

07:39.160 --> 07:42.660
but none was more heated than his feud with Kurt Busch.

07:42.660 --> 07:47.000
At the turn of the millennium, Kurt Busch was one of the fastest rising talents in the

07:47.000 --> 07:48.000
sport.

07:48.000 --> 07:52.580
In 1991, he was promoted to a full-time cup ride at just the age of 22.

07:52.580 --> 07:57.600
In his rookie season as NASCAR's newest phenom, Kurt Busch got rocked.

07:57.600 --> 08:01.740
He finished 27th in points with seven DNFs, and his biggest highlight of the year was

08:01.740 --> 08:05.000
being the last guy Dale Earnhardt ever flipped off.

08:05.000 --> 08:10.160
It's tough being a rookie at NASCAR's highest level, a lesson Kurt learned in the 2001 Phoenix

08:10.160 --> 08:14.320
race where he got turned by Jimmy Spencer in front of the entire field.

08:14.320 --> 08:16.600
Welcome to the big leagues, kid.

08:16.600 --> 08:20.880
At this point in time, Jimmy Spencer is in the opposite position of Kurt Busch.

08:20.880 --> 08:24.720
He's in the twilight of his career and his best days are long behind him.

08:24.720 --> 08:30.400
But in the 2002 Food City 500 at Bristol, Jimmy Spencer has the opportunity to do something

08:30.400 --> 08:35.080
he hasn't done in nearly eight years, win a cup series race.

08:35.080 --> 08:38.860
He's running second with just 60 laps to go and reeling in the leader.

08:38.860 --> 08:42.980
The only problem is that the driver running first is the same guy Jimmy Spencer wrecked

08:42.980 --> 08:44.780
just five months earlier.

08:44.780 --> 08:47.260
Of course, Kurt doesn't cut Jimmy any slack.

08:57.760 --> 09:00.980
On this day, youth prevails over experience.

09:00.980 --> 09:05.420
After the race, however, Spencer ominously warns that the young driver still has much

09:05.420 --> 09:06.420
to learn.

09:06.420 --> 09:09.160
There's a lot of things you can and can't do, and one thing you can't do is just beat

09:09.160 --> 09:10.160
and bang with people.

09:10.160 --> 09:13.660
And some guys have to learn, and they just have to learn the hard way.

09:13.660 --> 09:18.720
Five months later at Indianapolis, Spencer punted Busch at over 180 miles per hour.

09:18.720 --> 09:23.280
He just booted him out of the way.

09:23.280 --> 09:27.920
Kurt is absolutely livid and trashes Spencer in the post-wreck interview.

09:27.920 --> 09:31.680
We spun and that put us in a bad position, back there with the decrepit old has-beens,

09:31.680 --> 09:32.680
I guess.

09:32.680 --> 09:37.140
The feud continues to escalate until it reaches a boiling point in the next year's race at

09:37.140 --> 09:38.140
Michigan.

09:38.140 --> 09:41.700
Kurt swerves into Spencer trying to cut down one of his tires.

09:41.700 --> 09:45.220
After the race, Spencer reportedly marched over to Kurt's car and punched him in the

09:45.220 --> 09:46.220
face.

09:46.220 --> 09:52.020
Jimmy got out of the car, approached Kurt Busch, and actually punched Kurt Busch.

09:52.020 --> 09:56.440
Kurt left with a bloody nose and a chipped tooth, prompting NASCAR to suspend Jimmy Spencer

09:56.440 --> 09:57.860
for the next race.

09:57.860 --> 10:02.420
Now, at this point, it's important to recall that Jimmy Spencer has thus far demolished

10:02.420 --> 10:07.260
two of Kurt's race cars and his face, and the fans love him for it.

10:07.260 --> 10:11.960
The next race is littered with free Jimmy Spencer signs, and Mr. Excitement is arguably

10:11.960 --> 10:14.300
the most popular he's ever been.

10:14.300 --> 10:19.440
Sometimes a NASCAR feud represents more than just a simple disagreement between drivers.

10:19.440 --> 10:24.340
Kurt Busch and Jimmy Spencer symbolized a clash of generations in a changing sport.

10:24.340 --> 10:29.440
In the eyes of many fans at the time, Kurt Busch embodied a new wave of prima donna drivers

10:29.440 --> 10:43.560
who lacked the struggle and grit of seasoned veterans like Jimmy Spencer.

10:43.560 --> 10:47.700
Back in the day, drivers would settle disputes among themselves without any interference

10:47.700 --> 10:49.480
from the sanctioning body.

10:49.480 --> 10:54.640
Many felt that NASCAR was babying down the sport to conform to a more mainstream image.

10:54.640 --> 10:59.140
Too bad for them, NASCAR was entering a new age whether they were ready or not.

10:59.140 --> 11:03.820
Just one year afterwards, Kurt Busch would sit atop the sport as champion.

11:03.820 --> 11:08.820
Not long after that, Jimmy Spencer would retire and find a new home on the speed channel.

11:08.820 --> 11:13.120
While Kurt got the best of him in their time as competitors, Jimmy Spencer always finds

11:13.120 --> 11:25.420
a way to have the last laugh.

11:25.420 --> 11:30.060
Despite starting off as polar opposite rivals, Kurt Busch and Jimmy Spencer didn't end

11:30.060 --> 11:32.080
up being so different after all.

11:32.080 --> 11:34.060
NASCAR is always changing.

11:34.060 --> 11:49.980
Cry as you might, you can't stop the future.

11:49.980 --> 11:55.060
One of Kurt Busch's many career rivalries was a sibling rivalry with his brother Kyle.

11:55.060 --> 12:00.260
If Kurt was a can't miss talent, the younger Busch brother was a generational prodigy.

12:00.260 --> 12:05.460
While it took Kurt until age 23 to win in the cup series, Kyle did it at just 20 in

12:05.460 --> 12:06.740
his rookie season.

12:06.740 --> 12:10.540
Currently, he's in the conversation with Jeff Gordon and Jimmy Johnson as one of the

12:10.540 --> 12:13.420
greatest drivers of NASCAR's current era.

12:13.420 --> 12:18.700
In 2007, all three of these drivers raced on the same team, Hendrick Motorsports.

12:18.700 --> 12:23.540
Unfortunately, such great amassments of talent don't tend to stick around for very long.

12:23.540 --> 12:27.460
In the middle of the season, Kyle Busch wants out at Hendrick.

12:27.460 --> 12:32.040
Just like his brother, Kyle Busch had the tendency to lose his temper and had reportedly

12:32.040 --> 12:35.260
worn out his welcome with team owner Rick Hendrick.

12:35.260 --> 12:39.260
Despite his skirmish with Kurt in the All-Star race, Kyle Busch's greatest rival wouldn't

12:39.260 --> 12:40.780
come from his brother.

12:40.780 --> 12:48.020
It would come from his replacement.

12:48.020 --> 12:52.500
By the mid-2000s, Dale Earnhardt Jr.'s race team was on a downward spiral, and he was

12:52.500 --> 12:55.940
about to become the biggest free agent in all of NASCAR.

12:55.940 --> 13:00.940
As the sport's most popular star, Dale Jr. would provide an immediate boon to any team

13:00.940 --> 13:01.940
that signed him.

13:01.940 --> 13:05.980
Naturally, one of the first team owners to approach Jr. was Rick Hendrick.

13:05.980 --> 13:10.940
Beyond the appeal of joining NASCAR's most successful team, Jr. bonded with Rick Hendrick

13:10.940 --> 13:13.100
on a very personal level.

13:13.100 --> 13:17.300
Both had suffered tragic losses of family members earlier in the decade.

13:17.300 --> 13:22.380
With all that considered, Earnhardt and Hendrick were a match that seemed destined to happen.

13:22.380 --> 13:25.860
It's the 2007 Samsung 500 at Texas.

13:25.860 --> 13:31.140
On lap 252, Tony Stewart spins and Kyle Busch rear-ends Jr. in the scramble.

13:31.140 --> 13:34.180
Kyle thinks his car is total and retires from the race.

13:34.180 --> 13:37.980
Unbeknownst to him, however, his pit crew repairs the car and wants to send it back

13:37.980 --> 13:40.440
on track to pick up some extra points.

13:40.440 --> 13:43.580
The only problem is that Kyle Busch has gone AWOL.

13:43.580 --> 13:48.140
The team scurries to find a replacement driver just as Dale Jr. is pulling his wrecked car

13:48.140 --> 13:49.720
into the garage.

13:49.720 --> 13:54.440
Long story short, Dale Jr. ended up finishing the race in Kyle Busch's car that day.

13:54.440 --> 14:03.040
And so today, it is with great honor to introduce my new boss for 2008, Mr. Rick Hendrick.

14:03.040 --> 14:07.860
Was it a bizarre coincidence or perhaps a covert audition for his next ride?

14:07.860 --> 14:11.900
We may never know all the answers, but one thing's for sure, it wouldn't be the last

14:11.900 --> 14:18.760
incident involving Dale Jr. and Kyle Busch that season.

14:18.800 --> 14:23.200
Six months later, Kyle Busch is in a fierce battle for the point lead heading into Kansas

14:23.200 --> 14:26.140
while Jr. is out of championship contention.

14:26.140 --> 14:30.000
By this point, it's well known that Earnhardt will be replacing Kyle Busch at the end of

14:30.000 --> 14:34.440
the season, but Kyle is still trying to make the most of his lame duck run by going out

14:34.440 --> 14:35.720
with a bang.

14:35.720 --> 14:40.120
Just 30 laps in, however, Jr. runs over Kyle Busch on the backstretch and takes him out

14:40.120 --> 14:41.120
of the race.

14:41.120 --> 14:45.920
After it was over, Jr. apologized and said it was an accident, but Kyle Busch would not

14:45.920 --> 14:59.320
so easily forget the driver who cost him his first shot at a championship.

14:59.320 --> 15:04.040
It's the spring of 2008, and Dale Jr. wants badly to win for his new team.

15:04.040 --> 15:07.200
He is currently in the midst of a 70-race winless streak.

15:07.200 --> 15:12.360
Meanwhile, Kyle Busch is riding high in his new Joe Gibbs Racing Toyota, winning two of

15:12.360 --> 15:14.580
the first nine races on the season.

15:14.580 --> 15:19.060
In the final laps at Richmond, Dale Jr. is just a few miles from victory.

15:19.060 --> 15:32.340
Kyle Busch, however, has other plans.

15:32.340 --> 15:36.820
One could say that the end of this race profoundly shaped the next few years in NASCAR.

15:36.820 --> 15:41.420
Kyle Busch finished 2008 with eight victories and was instantly rocketed to public enemy

15:41.420 --> 15:48.340
number one in the sport.

15:48.340 --> 15:53.300
For Dale Jr., the incident would mark the beginning of the worst stretch of his career.

15:53.300 --> 15:58.340
After 2008, Jr. would not see victory lane for the next three seasons.

15:58.340 --> 16:03.580
In some cases, revenge can end up having far more influence than just a petty comeuppance.

16:03.580 --> 16:06.380
It can go on to define a driver's legacy.

16:06.380 --> 16:11.100
This event cemented Kyle Busch as a dominant villain and Dale Jr. as a lovable underdog

16:11.100 --> 16:13.380
who could never seem to catch a break.

16:13.380 --> 16:17.060
Two perceptions that neither driver could ever really overcome.

16:17.060 --> 16:21.100
Do you think that if Dale and Kyle could go back to this moment, history could have turned

16:21.100 --> 16:22.100
out differently?

16:22.100 --> 16:30.140
Well, the next time they went to Richmond, history repeated itself instead.

16:30.140 --> 16:34.820
Revenge in NASCAR can greatly influence how we perceive other drivers, but very rarely

16:34.820 --> 16:50.940
does it influence the actual outcome of a season.

16:50.940 --> 16:56.900
In 2014, NASCAR introduced the controversial elimination-style playoff format, an unintended

16:56.900 --> 17:02.840
consequence of which was giving drivers tremendous leverage and potentially spoiling the competition.

17:02.840 --> 17:07.040
If you're going to have a feud in NASCAR, you absolutely do not want to start one of

17:07.040 --> 17:08.040
the playoffs.

17:08.040 --> 17:09.960
So let's talk about Martinsville.

17:09.960 --> 17:14.640
It's the oldest remaining track on the NASCAR schedule, which really shows from its unique

17:14.640 --> 17:15.920
design.

17:15.920 --> 17:17.960
Remember Turn 11 from Sonoma?

17:17.960 --> 17:22.640
Well, double it back and that's basically the entire Martinsville racetrack.

17:22.640 --> 17:26.740
Of course, the close quarters racing creates the perfect breeding ground for tempers to

17:26.740 --> 17:27.740
flare.

17:27.740 --> 17:31.960
With the added pressure of the playoffs, the fall Martinsville race turns the intensity

17:31.960 --> 17:33.600
up to 11.

17:33.600 --> 17:38.000
Denny Hamlin had always been one of NASCAR's most consistent drivers, but he could never

17:38.000 --> 17:40.940
quite put it together when it counted most.

17:40.940 --> 17:44.660
Every time he found himself in position to contend for the championship, he would always

17:44.660 --> 17:47.680
end up suffering some inexplicable mishap.

17:47.680 --> 17:53.020
Heading into the 2017 playoff race at Martinsville, he's sitting sixth in points.

17:53.020 --> 17:57.400
If he wants to advance to the championship finale, he's going to have to catch a serious

17:57.400 --> 17:58.400
break.

17:58.400 --> 18:01.280
Chase Elliott is in quite a different place than Denny.

18:01.280 --> 18:05.920
He's not just looking for his first career championship, he's looking for his first career

18:05.920 --> 18:06.920
win.

18:06.920 --> 18:11.840
At age 21, he's in just his second full-time cup season, but the expectations surrounding

18:11.840 --> 18:15.920
him are about as high as any other prospect the sport has ever seen.

18:15.920 --> 18:18.800
Chase Elliott is a part of racing royalty.

18:18.800 --> 18:23.360
The son of NASCAR legend Bill Elliott, he has spent the past half decade as NASCAR's

18:23.360 --> 18:25.800
most anticipated young star.

18:25.800 --> 18:31.960
By 2017, he's next in line behind Dale Jr. as the sport's perennial most popular driver.

18:31.960 --> 18:36.800
But more than 70 races into his cup career, he still has yet to win at NASCAR's highest

18:36.800 --> 18:37.800
level.

18:37.800 --> 18:41.860
Today at Martinsville, Chase has a pretty good shot at finally breaking through to victory

18:41.860 --> 18:42.860
lane.

18:42.860 --> 18:47.000
Winning here wouldn't just validate the talent of the young phenom, it would punch his ticket

18:47.000 --> 18:49.080
to the championship race.

18:49.080 --> 18:53.800
He's led over 100 laps so far, and with just four laps to go, he pulls ahead of the field

18:53.800 --> 18:56.760
and looks to be cruising to a fairytale ending.

18:56.760 --> 19:01.640
Too bad for Chase, the driver behind him is Denny Hamlin, who is not about to let another

19:01.640 --> 19:11.360
opportunity go to waste.

19:11.360 --> 19:16.800
Chase Elliott did not win on this day, but luckily for our story, neither did Hamlin.

19:16.800 --> 19:21.120
Denny swung for the fences in the closing laps of this race, but in doing so, he just

19:21.120 --> 19:39.800
made himself the biggest target in NASCAR.

19:39.800 --> 19:42.880
It's now one race before the championship finale.

19:42.880 --> 19:47.320
In the closing laps, Denny Hamlin is holding on to the final transfer spot by the slimmest

19:47.320 --> 19:48.760
of margins.

19:48.760 --> 19:52.880
It was at this point that Chase Elliott taught Hamlin a lesson in why you should never mess

19:52.880 --> 20:15.800
with racing royalty.

20:15.800 --> 20:20.000
Believe it or not, this wasn't the first time the driver of the 24 car got revenge

20:20.000 --> 20:32.760
at Phoenix for something that happened at Martinsville.

20:32.760 --> 20:37.560
Of course, the former driver of the 24 car was none other than Jeff Gordon, who was in

20:37.560 --> 20:41.200
the conversation for the greatest stock car driver ever.

20:41.200 --> 20:46.400
In 1998, he drove the greatest statistical season in NASCAR's modern era, scoring an

20:46.400 --> 20:49.580
unthinkable average finish of 5.7.

20:49.580 --> 20:53.700
His 2012 season, on the other hand, was not quite as spectacular.

20:53.700 --> 20:58.360
After the first five races, he is sitting a dismal 25th in the point standings.

20:58.360 --> 21:01.060
He's looking to turn his luck around at Martinsville.

21:01.060 --> 21:04.940
Winning here would have extra significance because at this point, Hendrick Motorsports

21:04.940 --> 21:07.520
is sitting at 199 wins.

21:07.520 --> 21:11.400
Over the whole season, everyone has been wondering which Hendrick driver will take the honor

21:11.400 --> 21:14.540
of scoring win number 200 for the team.

21:14.540 --> 21:19.360
So far, no Hendrick driver has won in 2012, but on this day, it certainly looks like it's

21:19.360 --> 21:20.520
going to happen.

21:20.520 --> 21:25.260
With 10 laps to go, Jeff Gordon is in an amazing battle with his teammate Jimmy Johnson.

21:25.260 --> 21:30.040
So it looks like, barring a completely preposterous turn of events, that Rick Hendrick will get

21:30.040 --> 21:31.960
his 200th victory.

21:31.960 --> 21:36.480
Just as Gordon makes the pass on Johnson with five to go, the caution comes out.

21:36.480 --> 21:40.720
For reasons we still don't understand to this day, David Rudiman doesn't come to

21:40.720 --> 21:45.020
pit road during an obvious mechanical issue and stalls out on the front stretch.

21:45.020 --> 21:48.800
The field lines back up and the two Hendrick cars look to settle it on what should be the

21:48.800 --> 21:50.240
final restart.

21:50.240 --> 21:54.200
The only problem now is that they're on worn tires and are sitting ducks to the pack

21:54.200 --> 21:56.400
behind them who pitted for fresh tires.

21:56.400 --> 22:02.020
Looks like the main possibly clamped Boyer in the 15 won the battle off pit road.

22:02.020 --> 22:04.080
That's the guy you better keep an eye on.

22:04.080 --> 22:08.560
Well, the green flag drops and both Hendrick cars get a poor jump off the line.

22:08.560 --> 22:12.720
Simultaneously, Ryan Newman gives one of the biggest shelves in Martinsville history to

22:12.720 --> 22:16.040
Clint Boyer, who's directly behind the Hendrick cars.

22:16.040 --> 22:20.440
With nowhere else to really go, Boyer makes the split second decision to dive bomb inside

22:20.440 --> 22:21.800
of Jeff Gordon.

22:21.800 --> 22:24.960
Three wide in a turn one at Martinsville.

22:24.960 --> 22:26.960
This went about as well as you may have guessed.

22:26.960 --> 22:28.960
Boyer shot, getting out of the triple!

22:28.960 --> 22:29.960
Three wide, three wide!

22:29.960 --> 22:30.960
There goes Newman!

22:30.960 --> 22:32.960
Newman's going to take the lead!

22:32.960 --> 22:36.080
That was not pretty!

22:36.080 --> 22:40.420
Clint Boyer was a driver who always seemed to be in the wrong place at the wrong time.

22:40.420 --> 22:45.360
He is perhaps best known for finishing the 07 Daytona 500 upside down.

22:45.360 --> 22:49.640
He was still talented enough to occasionally win a race or two, but whenever Clint found

22:49.640 --> 22:52.800
success, misfortune always seemed to follow.

22:52.800 --> 22:55.940
The 2012 race at Martinsville is no exception.

22:55.940 --> 23:00.320
Looking back, it's hard to say Clint did anything wrong in this situation, but he still ended

23:00.320 --> 23:02.160
up bearing the brunt of the controversy.

23:02.560 --> 23:05.720
Well, Clint and I are friends, you know, and I have a lot of respect for him.

23:05.720 --> 23:09.040
He's a great race car driver and I'm glad I talked to him before I talked to you guys

23:09.040 --> 23:10.880
because I was pretty mad at him.

23:10.880 --> 23:13.400
After the race, Jeff Gordon is merciful.

23:13.400 --> 23:17.680
Their next altercation, however, wouldn't be on such pleasant terms.

23:17.680 --> 23:21.760
Six months later, the Cup Series returns to Martinsville and the complexion of the season

23:21.760 --> 23:23.440
looks very different.

23:23.440 --> 23:27.460
With just four races left, the championship picture is wide open.

23:27.460 --> 23:31.720
After the worst start to a year he's ever had, Jeff Gordon has made a remarkable late

23:31.720 --> 23:35.720
season comeback to put himself within striking distance of the title.

23:35.720 --> 23:40.520
Right in the hunt with Gordon is Clint Boyer, who is having the season of his life.

23:40.520 --> 23:44.680
Late in the race at Martinsville, the two make contact in a hard-fought side-by-side

23:44.680 --> 23:45.680
battle.

23:45.680 --> 23:48.160
This time, Jeff Gordon is not as forgiving.

23:48.160 --> 23:54.640
After a second run-in on the season, Clint Boyer is skating on thin ice.

23:54.640 --> 23:58.680
Two weeks later at Phoenix, Clint Boyer is closer to the championship than he's ever

23:58.680 --> 23:59.680
been.

23:59.680 --> 24:03.720
Late in the day, he's running in the top 5 and is less than 30 points behind the championship

24:03.720 --> 24:04.720
leader.

24:04.720 --> 24:08.560
It's at this moment when Boyer runs into who else but Jeff Gordon.

24:08.560 --> 24:24.160
Unfortunately for Boyer, this is the straw that broke the camel's back.

24:24.160 --> 24:28.240
It's still surreal watching this back today nearly a decade afterwards.

24:28.240 --> 24:32.760
Jeff Gordon hunted down Boyer like a dog and erased his championship hopes in one flick

24:32.760 --> 24:34.280
of the steering wheel.

24:34.280 --> 24:38.880
What ensued was possibly the biggest melee in the history of NASCAR, but for as many

24:38.880 --> 24:42.840
punches that were thrown that day, it didn't change the outcome.

24:42.840 --> 24:46.920
Clint Boyer would go on to lose the championship by just 39 points.

24:46.920 --> 24:51.560
If Gordon doesn't take him out, it's very possible he could have won the whole thing.

24:51.560 --> 24:55.560
Boyer would never again come as close to winning a cup series title.

24:55.560 --> 24:57.680
Jeff Gordon is a racing god.

24:57.680 --> 25:00.400
He can give and he can take away.

25:00.400 --> 25:05.560
It's hard to imagine a moment in NASCAR more savage than Gordon's revenge on Clint Boyer,

25:05.560 --> 25:10.420
but believe it or not, there is one incident that tops it, mostly because it came from

25:10.420 --> 25:22.240
such an unlikely source.

25:22.240 --> 25:26.720
If I could use one word to describe Matt Kenseth's career in NASCAR, it would be

25:26.720 --> 25:27.860
overshadowed.

25:27.860 --> 25:32.700
If you asked fans to list off the best drivers of the 21st century, many of them would probably

25:32.700 --> 25:34.480
forget to mention him.

25:34.480 --> 25:39.720
In 2003, he put together one of the most dominant seasons in recent memory, only to have it

25:39.720 --> 25:43.480
continually discredited because he only won a single race.

25:43.480 --> 25:48.340
Many have inferred that Kenseth's 2003 season directly persuaded NASCAR to overhaul the

25:48.340 --> 25:53.860
entire championship format to make sure that a performance like it could never happen again.

25:53.860 --> 25:58.000
So what exactly is the problem with a guy like Matt Kenseth nearly leading the points

25:58.000 --> 25:59.000
wire-to-wire?

25:59.000 --> 26:04.060
Well, the thing is that Matt Kenseth was not exactly the most exciting driver.

26:04.060 --> 26:09.020
He had a rather milquetoast personality which many considered to be downright boring to

26:09.020 --> 26:13.300
watch, but Matt's relative non-intrigue served more as a testament to how good he

26:13.300 --> 26:15.240
was at staying out of trouble.

26:15.240 --> 26:19.740
He always played it cool with the media and avoided drama like the plague.

26:19.740 --> 26:23.900
On track, he was one of the cleanest and most respectful drivers out there.

26:23.900 --> 26:28.780
It was really difficult to recall any examples of Matt Kenseth intentionally wrecking someone

26:28.780 --> 26:29.980
in a race.

26:29.980 --> 26:34.600
On the very few occasions he did end up in an altercation, he always seemed to take much

26:34.600 --> 26:37.000
more punishment than he dished out.

26:37.000 --> 26:39.640
So remember Brian Vickers from Chapter 1?

26:39.640 --> 26:44.360
Well, getting revenge on Tony Stewart must have awoken some kind of demon within him,

26:44.360 --> 26:48.960
because later that season at Martinsville, Vickers went on possibly the biggest rampage

26:48.960 --> 26:50.640
in NASCAR history.

26:50.640 --> 26:55.860
Throughout the race, Vickers takes out Regan Smith, Montoya, Jamie McMurray, and then starts

26:55.860 --> 27:00.400
beating and banging on Matt Kenseth, who at that moment is battling for the championship

27:00.400 --> 27:01.400
lead.

27:01.400 --> 27:05.560
Kenseth tries to put an end to Vickers reign of terror by punting him out of the way, but

27:05.560 --> 27:08.840
that only makes him the sole target of the wrath.

27:08.840 --> 27:12.920
Just a few laps later, Vickers plows into the back of Kenseth, who goes on to finish

27:12.920 --> 27:14.920
outside of the top 30.

27:14.920 --> 27:19.240
Not content with just one act of vengeance, however, Vickers would take out Kenseth again

27:19.240 --> 27:21.400
two weeks later at Phoenix.

27:21.400 --> 27:25.840
Needless to say, Matt Kenseth didn't end up winning the championship this season.

27:25.840 --> 27:29.840
Keep in mind, this happened just one year before Jeff Gordon caused Clint Boyer the

27:29.840 --> 27:33.320
championship at the same track and nearly started a riot.

27:33.320 --> 27:37.120
After Vickers did the same thing to Kenseth, this is what Matt had to say.

27:37.120 --> 27:45.160
That's just the kind of guy Matt was.

27:45.160 --> 27:47.880
It was that hard to make him mad.

27:47.880 --> 27:53.320
In 2013, Matt Kenseth departed from longtime team owner Jack Roush to race the 20 car for

27:53.320 --> 27:54.800
Joe Gibbs Racing.

27:54.800 --> 27:59.840
The driver he replaced was Joey Logano, who is far and away the most controversial driver

27:59.840 --> 28:01.840
in the sport today.

28:01.840 --> 28:21.800
There's just something about Logano that really rubs people the wrong way.

28:21.800 --> 28:26.480
He was at one point the most highly touted NASCAR prospect ever, literally earning the

28:26.480 --> 28:29.560
moniker of the greatest thing since sliced bread.

28:29.560 --> 28:33.520
The immense amount of media hype surrounding his rise through the ranks made it tough to

28:33.520 --> 28:35.480
root for the guy early on.

28:35.480 --> 28:40.000
It didn't help that his racing style got on the nerves of many fans and drivers.

28:40.000 --> 28:44.000
When you get right down to it, Joey Logano is a dirty driver.

28:44.000 --> 28:48.040
When the chips are down, he will resort to cheap tactics if that's what it takes to

28:48.040 --> 28:49.040
win.

28:49.040 --> 28:52.240
He'll block someone with a huge run and risk wrecking the whole field.

28:52.240 --> 28:55.760
He'll slam someone into the wall if he knows they're gonna pass him.

28:55.760 --> 29:00.840
He'll move a 53-year-old Mark Martin out of the way rather than going through the inconvenience

29:00.840 --> 29:25.640
of racing him clean for the win.

29:25.640 --> 29:30.520
Being a recklessly inconsiderate driver isn't necessarily a bad thing, but the difference

29:30.520 --> 29:36.020
between Logano and someone like Dale Earnhardt is that Joey doesn't own it in a cool way.

29:36.020 --> 29:40.980
He still likes to carry himself as the innocent babyface who's never done anything wrong.

29:40.980 --> 29:45.560
I'm sure that off the track, Joey Logano is a really great guy, but when he gets behind

29:45.560 --> 29:54.200
the wheel, it's hard to find a driver less likable.

29:54.200 --> 29:58.940
By 2015, the hatred for Joey Logano was reaching an all-time high.

29:58.940 --> 30:04.180
He's having the best statistical season of his career and looks poised to take the championship.

30:04.180 --> 30:08.920
One of his biggest challengers for the title is Matt Kenseth, who has won 5 races through

30:08.920 --> 30:11.640
28 events, the most in the series.

30:11.640 --> 30:16.480
In a playoff format where winning races is practically the only thing that matters, the

30:16.480 --> 30:23.980
season's winningest driver has a pretty good shot to take the championship.

30:23.980 --> 30:26.060
The drama begins at Charlotte.

30:26.060 --> 30:29.600
Joey Logano wins, locking himself into the next round.

30:29.600 --> 30:34.180
Matt Kenseth finishes almost dead last after wrecking early, putting himself in a virtual

30:34.180 --> 30:36.140
must-win situation.

30:36.140 --> 30:39.420
The next week at Kansas, he's looking to do just that.

30:39.420 --> 30:43.660
He's dominated the race, leading more than half the laps in the event.

30:43.660 --> 30:48.140
The only other driver who's been able to contend with him all day is Joey Logano.

30:48.140 --> 30:52.420
Now let me reiterate here that Joey is locked in to the next round.

30:52.420 --> 30:56.300
He has nothing to gain from challenging Matt Kenseth for the win.

30:56.300 --> 31:00.080
It just doesn't make strategic sense to escalate things here.

31:00.080 --> 31:04.780
But in this situation, Joey Logano's probably not thinking about strategy.

31:04.780 --> 31:09.140
He's been around for a while now and knows that Matt's an easy target, a guy who got

31:09.140 --> 31:13.340
pushed around for his whole career and never once did a damn thing about it.

31:13.340 --> 31:17.160
Joey doesn't do what he does next because it's a smart racing move.

31:17.160 --> 31:19.720
He does it because he knows he can get away with it.

31:27.720 --> 31:33.320
Many modern NASCAR fans consider the 2015 season to be one of the worst in recent memory.

31:33.320 --> 31:38.560
A combination of subpar racing, inconsistent meddling from the sanctioning body, and season-long

31:38.560 --> 31:43.460
dominance from the sport's least popular drivers left most fans desperate for something

31:43.460 --> 31:45.300
to be excited about.

31:45.300 --> 31:49.900
Unfortunately for them, the following race would be the most miserable yet.

31:49.900 --> 31:54.500
The race ended under dubious circumstances after Kevin Harvick wrecked the whole field

31:54.500 --> 31:56.340
on the final restart.

31:56.340 --> 32:01.140
Dale Jr. came gut-wrenchingly close to saving himself from elimination, but he never even

32:01.140 --> 32:03.420
had a chance to race for the win.

32:03.420 --> 32:10.180
As the caution flag flies, the sport's most popular driver is just edged out by Joey Logano.

32:10.180 --> 32:15.260
Amidst the chaos and controversy, Matt Kenseth is quietly eliminated from his last great

32:15.260 --> 32:17.660
shot at winning the championship.

32:17.660 --> 32:21.040
In this moment, NASCAR is entering the dark timeline.

32:21.040 --> 32:23.680
The fans have been beaten and broken down.

32:23.680 --> 32:28.180
If they want to salvage any hope out of this season, they're going to need a hero.

32:30.980 --> 32:34.340
You make decisions every day, you make decisions every minute behind a wheel.

32:34.340 --> 32:37.820
To me, strategically, that doesn't seem like such a great decision for him.

32:37.820 --> 32:39.780
But it's the one he made and that's how he wanted to win.

32:41.780 --> 32:43.780
Oh, and it goes to 20!

32:45.780 --> 32:51.780
And Kenseth, cleared by Logano, maybe no!

33:04.260 --> 33:09.180
Statistically speaking, there's no doubt that Joey Logano was the best driver of the 2015

33:09.180 --> 33:10.180
season.

33:10.180 --> 33:15.000
In hindsight, it's difficult to imagine a scenario where he doesn't win the championship.

33:15.740 --> 33:20.320
He would have to succumb to a cataclysmic event and a stupidly gimmicked points system.

33:20.320 --> 33:24.940
Unfortunately for Joey, he was a victim of both, but only one of these things was out

33:24.940 --> 33:26.440
of his control.

33:26.440 --> 33:31.120
Joey Logano always wanted to have his cake and eat it too, and he would find out that

33:31.120 --> 33:34.780
doing so is a quick way to end up with no cake at all.

33:34.780 --> 33:39.020
Immediately afterwards, NASCAR suspended Matt Kenseth for two races.

33:39.020 --> 33:41.220
Not that it really mattered at that point.

33:41.240 --> 33:46.260
Joey Logano would go on to miss the championship race, and he learned an important lesson.

33:46.260 --> 33:50.300
The problem with taking from someone when you have nothing to gain is that one day,

33:50.300 --> 33:53.300
that person may wind up with nothing to lose.

33:53.300 --> 33:57.060
Throughout his career, Matt Kenseth was never really a popular driver.

33:57.060 --> 34:00.720
But in that moment, all of us were Matt Kenseth fans.

34:00.720 --> 34:05.220
In a way, Matt Kenseth helped everyone get revenge on Joey Logano.

34:05.220 --> 34:12.940
Well, unless you were a Logano fan.

34:12.940 --> 34:15.060
But nobody really cares about them.

34:20.420 --> 34:23.860
Revenge tells many different kinds of stories across racing.

34:23.860 --> 34:30.380
Stories about greed, ego, respect, legacy, change, chaos, and justice.

34:30.380 --> 34:34.700
These stories are all unique in their own right, but most of them end in the same way.

34:34.700 --> 34:38.500
The story of revenge is ultimately a story of forgiveness.

34:38.500 --> 34:43.100
Although revenge can provide us with some of the most captivating moments in auto racing,

34:43.100 --> 34:45.580
there's a reason it's ultimately rare.

34:45.580 --> 34:50.420
In NASCAR, vengeful vendettas inevitably leave behind a trail of wrecked race cars, poor

34:50.420 --> 34:52.700
finishes and shattered dreams.

34:52.700 --> 34:55.900
In the game of revenge, everybody loses.

34:55.900 --> 34:58.620
Most drivers simply choose not to play.

34:58.620 --> 35:02.800
So the next time you're on the road and feel like carrying out your own piece of revenge,

35:02.800 --> 35:24.000
it's probably best to just turn the other cheek.

35:24.000 --> 35:29.680
Hey everyone, Amp Media back again to bring you another fantastic toy review, as if the

35:29.680 --> 35:33.360
downward spiral couldn't get low enough.

35:33.360 --> 35:39.360
Today I'm pleased to announce that I've partnered with the fine people at U2's Collectible Figurines

35:39.360 --> 35:42.560
to bring you the Emperor Lemon U2's.

35:42.560 --> 35:47.320
So I work with U2's to design everything you see here, the figurine, the packages.

35:47.320 --> 35:51.640
So go ahead and give them some of your hard earned cash, because a percentage of it goes

35:51.640 --> 35:53.760
to me.

35:53.760 --> 35:59.360
Hopefully I get enough royalties from this to cover the lawsuit from Disney.

35:59.360 --> 36:05.520
But I do like this box, it has your colors, the green, the purple, the downward spiral.

36:05.520 --> 36:10.820
They sculpted the tongue and teeth individually, that's a nice touch.

36:10.820 --> 36:13.800
I can really be tasting the money with this one.

36:13.800 --> 36:19.760
Yeah, I'm actually really impressed by the way that they make these, I mean this is kind

36:19.760 --> 36:22.520
of cool because this is like your Avatar character.

36:22.520 --> 36:23.520
Oh god, Avatar?

36:23.520 --> 36:26.760
I'm going to get sued by Nickelodeon too?

36:26.760 --> 36:32.240
But you know, you gotta love the attention to detail, it's even got a little mini downward

36:32.240 --> 36:34.200
spiral on the microphone.

36:34.200 --> 36:38.360
Do I have your disposable income now?

36:38.360 --> 36:42.440
And keep in mind, this is a limited edition figure, meaning that once the initial run

36:42.440 --> 36:44.640
is over, they're gone for good.

36:44.640 --> 36:51.440
Wow, I guess there will never ever be another collectible figurine like this one.

36:51.440 --> 36:54.480
Well you better get one while you still have a chance, because these are probably going

36:54.480 --> 36:56.280
to go really fast I imagine.

36:56.800 --> 36:59.800
These are going to go faster than I left the SOTY podcast.

37:03.680 --> 37:08.480
So head out to the website and start hoarding these things like Fat Housewives on Walmart

37:08.480 --> 37:09.480
on Black Friday.

37:09.480 --> 37:12.280
Man, hopefully these will sell better than my NFTs.

37:12.280 --> 37:14.280
Bruh, bruh, bruh, bruh, bruh.

37:14.280 --> 37:15.280
Grand Jam!

37:15.280 --> 37:18.280
Get down for Harambe.

37:18.280 --> 37:20.560
I'm awfully glad for you.

37:20.560 --> 37:21.560
How exciting.

37:21.840 --> 37:26.960
I mean, it makes sense right, because having a U2's figurine validates you as an actual

37:26.960 --> 37:27.960
public figure.

37:27.960 --> 37:31.560
Of course, nobody knows who I am, so I mean why would they reach out to me?

37:31.560 --> 37:32.760
That'd be ridiculous.

37:32.760 --> 37:36.240
Why would U2's reach out to me and offer me a figurine?

37:36.240 --> 37:39.160
I mean everyone else has one, even you have one.

37:39.160 --> 37:44.360
Sorry Rusty, this is something only YouTubers with YouTubes can understand.

37:51.560 --> 37:55.560
And just remember, he's going to have to run 42 laps or he's going to be close on fuel.

37:55.560 --> 37:57.560
Boy, he's really slowing down too Larry.

37:57.560 --> 38:01.560
I mean 28 looks to be like really closing up in a hurry now.

38:01.560 --> 38:06.560
Two laps to go this time, Tony Stewart draws a bead on Terry Levani for third place.

38:06.560 --> 38:12.560
I heard somebody say, and I think it was Naidu, that something was happening to the car.

38:12.560 --> 38:16.560
Stewart makes the pass for third place on Bull's Center.

38:16.560 --> 38:18.560
And it's over.

38:18.560 --> 38:19.560
What happened?
