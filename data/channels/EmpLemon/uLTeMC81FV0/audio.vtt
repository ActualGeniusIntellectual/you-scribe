WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:05.200
So the other day I had an epiphany. I was bored and flipping through channels on TV and I happened

00:05.200 --> 00:11.440
to stumble upon Jimmy Kimmel Live and for the first time ever I started watching Jimmy Kimmel.

00:11.440 --> 00:18.400
I sat down and watched this program for about 15 minutes and it was genuinely, no joke, some of the

00:18.400 --> 00:23.840
most god-awful content I have ever seen on television. If you haven't watched a full episode

00:23.840 --> 00:28.800
of Jimmy Kimmel, the closest thing I could compare it to would be watching an old tortoise slowly

00:28.800 --> 00:34.880
cross a highway at rush hour. There's just an odd looming feeling of disgust that's difficult for

00:34.880 --> 00:41.200
me to describe and that's when it hit me. I cannot stand Jimmy Kimmel. Jimmy Kimmel is one of the

00:41.200 --> 00:47.120
most insufferable individuals I've ever witnessed. I have a theory that no one actually likes Jimmy

00:47.120 --> 00:52.400
Kimmel. I think at most people just tolerate him. I find it really hard to believe that there are

00:52.400 --> 00:58.400
any die-hard Jimmy Kimmel fans out there. There may be people that like the show but I just don't

00:58.400 --> 01:03.920
buy that anyone likes him. But by the same token, most people don't really dislike him either. He's

01:03.920 --> 01:08.560
a guy who most of the time is just so bland and uninteresting that nobody really pays attention

01:08.560 --> 01:15.040
to him and Jimmy Kimmel has used this tactic of being just bland enough to slowly wriggle his way

01:15.040 --> 01:20.560
into the flesh of popular culture. I think most people just assume that because Jimmy Kimmel is

01:20.560 --> 01:24.880
everywhere, then he must be some really talented and respected guy that everyone loves. It's like

01:24.880 --> 01:29.440
the Emperor's New Clothes. Everyone just assumes Jimmy Kimmel is this really great guy and no one

01:29.440 --> 01:34.480
really questions it. But when you dig a little bit deeper, you'll find that Jimmy Kimmel is actually a

01:34.480 --> 01:40.640
very problematic individual. In fact, Jimmy Kimmel is emblematic of some very troubling issues in

01:40.640 --> 01:45.760
American society as a whole. And before I jump into why, it's important to recognize that when I talk

01:45.760 --> 01:50.880
about Jimmy Kimmel, I'm talking about the persona he portrays on television. I don't know the guy,

01:50.880 --> 01:56.960
maybe he's a really good dude off screen. But on screen, Jimmy Kimmel is a cultural tumor and I

01:56.960 --> 02:03.280
don't think anybody realizes just how bad he is. This is the definitive Jimmy Kimmel rant.

02:20.880 --> 02:30.640
So let's start with the obvious here. Jimmy Kimmel is supposedly a comedian, yet his show isn't really

02:30.640 --> 02:35.760
that funny. And yeah, yeah, I get that humorous objective and whatever, but Jimmy Kimmel is one of

02:35.760 --> 02:41.760
the least funny comedians I have ever seen. And a lot of people would probably agree with me on this.

02:41.760 --> 02:47.280
Let me put it to you this way. Watching Jimmy Kimmel is like watching a try to laugh challenge.

02:47.280 --> 02:53.360
It's actually somewhat fascinating how unfunny this show is. Winter Storm Quinn as the Weather

02:53.360 --> 02:57.920
Channel, uh, or Winter Storm, Winter Storm Quinoa as the Food Network is calling it.

02:59.840 --> 03:04.800
You can be funny by either constructing clever and well thought out jokes or by making a joke so

03:04.800 --> 03:10.480
unfunny that it is funny. When Jimmy Kimmel structures his comedy, he somehow fails to land

03:10.480 --> 03:16.560
on either end of the spectrum. His humor is so bland and tepid that it's actually somewhat sad.

03:16.560 --> 03:21.440
It's like watching a middle-aged school teacher trying his hardest to appear funny to the students

03:21.440 --> 03:25.200
even though he's completely out of touch. You almost want to throw in a pity chuckle,

03:25.200 --> 03:30.400
but Kimmel delivers his jokes in such a smug and cocky way that you can't feel sorry for him.

03:30.400 --> 03:35.360
He just ends up floundering on stage as you wait for him to shut up and interview a celebrity.

03:35.360 --> 03:40.320
It's pretty ironic how the least entertaining part of Jimmy Kimmel Live is Jimmy Kimmel,

03:40.320 --> 03:44.960
but that's nothing. I wish Jimmy Kimmel only stuck to unfunny jokes because the other stuff

03:44.960 --> 03:53.600
on the show is even more problematic. So if you've ever watched any clip from Jimmy Kimmel,

03:53.600 --> 03:58.720
it's probably been one of the show's side segments like mean tweets or street interviews.

03:58.720 --> 04:04.960
Katy Perry has a voice that reminds me of balls covered in glass sliding down my throat.

04:04.960 --> 04:08.320
They ask you how you are, you just have to say that you're fine. You're not really fine,

04:08.320 --> 04:12.400
but you just can't get into it. And as far as I can tell, these segments are really hit or miss.

04:12.400 --> 04:16.240
The two segments I happened to watch on TV the other day were pretty atrocious.

04:16.240 --> 04:19.040
One of them was literally just making fun of a guy's foreign accent.

04:29.600 --> 04:34.400
And the other was some of the most uncomfortable five minutes of television I've ever seen.

04:34.400 --> 04:38.640
I hate to use the word cringe, but that's honestly all I felt when watching this segment.

04:38.720 --> 04:42.400
I genuinely feel sorry for the two families who participated in this.

05:01.520 --> 05:05.840
But regardless of the quality of these segments, you have to realize that they all profit off of

05:05.840 --> 05:10.320
other people's content. Jimmy Kimmel takes advantage of powerless individuals to fill

05:10.320 --> 05:15.040
content on his show. He's essentially doing the same thing as YouTube compilation and reaction

05:15.040 --> 05:19.840
channels. Basically Jimmy Kimmel knows he's not entertaining enough to carry the show on his own,

05:19.840 --> 05:25.200
so he supplements his programming with other people's ideas. He takes trendy ideas from the

05:25.200 --> 05:29.840
internet and fools the public into thinking he came up with them on his own. He just plasters

05:29.840 --> 05:35.680
his face and logo over real entertaining content and funnels all the credit to himself. We rip

05:35.680 --> 05:41.200
apart YouTubers like SoFloAntonio for doing the same thing, yet Jimbo has been doing this stuff

05:41.200 --> 05:46.880
all along on national television. I won't lie, this is definitely me when I'm driving.

05:46.880 --> 05:48.480
...and several other traffic violations...

05:52.000 --> 05:54.560
That's not a hit and run, that's a run and hit is what it is.

05:56.320 --> 06:02.000
Funny jokes. It's just lazy and it sets a poor precedent for entertainment as a whole.

06:02.000 --> 06:06.480
Why work hard to write creative and original content when you can just repost ideas and

06:06.480 --> 06:12.400
entertain your audience regardless? But whatever. So what if Jimmy Kimmel profits off of unoriginal

06:12.400 --> 06:17.760
and unfunny content? These things are somewhat forgivable. It's a network TV show, this kind

06:17.760 --> 06:23.440
of stuff happens all over the place. So what's the big deal? And if Jimmy Kimmel only did these two

06:23.440 --> 06:29.520
things, then I wouldn't be making this video. But no, old Jimbo is not satisfied with just being

06:29.520 --> 06:35.840
unoriginal and unfunny. No no no, he has to actively try and warp society as he does it,

06:35.840 --> 06:41.200
and that's where I draw the line. Now it's my problem.

06:41.200 --> 07:01.120
So let's talk about politics. Jimmy Kimmel likes to talk about politics. Actually,

07:01.120 --> 07:04.400
politics is a bit of a stretch. Jimmy Kimmel likes to talk about...

07:05.280 --> 07:18.880
Donald Trump. Are you aware that Donald Trump is the President of the United States?

07:18.880 --> 07:23.280
No, but seriously, this guy never shuts up about Donald Trump. And this is not really

07:23.280 --> 07:27.600
all Jimmy Kimmel's fault. It's part of a larger trend that I like to call the Colbert Effect.

07:27.600 --> 07:33.520
So here's a bit of background. In 2014, longtime late night TV host David Letterman retired,

07:33.520 --> 07:38.560
and CBS elected to replace him with Stephen Colbert, the former host of the Colbert Report

07:38.560 --> 07:44.000
on Comedy Central. The Colbert Report was a politically charged parody of Fox News hosts,

07:44.000 --> 07:48.640
and Colbert himself comes from the same school of thought as outspoken liberal comedian Jon

07:48.640 --> 07:53.680
Stewart. So when Colbert took over the late show, he brought his political viewpoints to a more

07:53.680 --> 07:59.360
mainstream audience. And by political viewpoints, I mean bashing Donald Trump for 40 minutes straight.

07:59.360 --> 08:04.560
But truth be told, Trump bashing is a good way to attract viewers. After Trump embarrassed

08:04.560 --> 08:09.680
the Democrats in the 2016 election, American liberals reacted like a swarm of hornets

08:09.680 --> 08:15.040
defending their nest. These bitter and delusional liberals have developed such a raging vendetta

08:15.040 --> 08:20.800
against Trump and the Republicans that they will stop at no end to viciously attack anything he

08:20.800 --> 08:25.760
does. Because that totally worked in the 18 months before the election. But anyway, after Trump's

08:25.760 --> 08:31.360
inauguration, Colbert's late show attracted these angry liberal viewers en masse, and it became the

08:31.360 --> 08:36.400
highest viewed program in its category. He took over the position from Jimmy Fallon, host of the

08:36.400 --> 08:42.160
Tonight Show, who chose to downplay Trump discussion in order to preserve the comedy of his program.

08:42.160 --> 08:47.920
Jimmy, this is working for other people. Maybe we should step into the anti-Trump lane and get in

08:47.920 --> 08:51.600
on this. It's just not what I do. I think it'd be weird for me to start doing it now. I don't really

08:51.600 --> 08:57.040
even, you know, care that much about politics. I've got to be honest, I love pop culture more than

08:57.040 --> 09:01.920
I love politics. Which is actually a pretty respectable decision, although he certainly paid

09:01.920 --> 09:06.560
for it in the ratings. So we've already established that Jimmy Kimmel is unoriginal and he doesn't

09:06.560 --> 09:11.280
really care about comedy. So he decided to steal the idea of Trump bashing and use it in his own

09:11.280 --> 09:17.040
show to try to boost his own ratings. And my lord is it obnoxious. Trump, Trump, the President.

09:17.280 --> 09:21.600
President. Donald Trump. Trump. President. Trump administration. Here's the problem.

09:21.600 --> 09:26.800
You can talk about serious political issues or you can have innocent family scavenger hunts.

09:26.800 --> 09:31.920
But you can't have them both. I'm sorry, but people don't tune into late night talk shows

09:31.920 --> 09:38.000
after a hard day of work to get lectured about how bad America is. And even the ones who do

09:38.560 --> 09:43.920
won't take you seriously because five minutes later you're Skyping a dabbing suburban family.

09:44.000 --> 09:49.760
You've generated a completely unnecessary conflict of interest, but Jimmy Kimmel is so desperate for

09:49.760 --> 09:55.280
viewership that he tries to play both lanes and he ends up turning politics into a joke and making

09:55.280 --> 10:00.480
his comedy less funny. Let's just look at this segment from the episode I watched. For those of

10:00.480 --> 10:05.680
you who don't know, the U.S. and North Korea have been on bad terms since the Korean War

10:05.680 --> 10:11.680
60 years ago. North Korea literally teaches anti-American propaganda in their schools,

10:11.680 --> 10:15.840
which is admittedly not too different from the state of California. But seriously though,

10:15.840 --> 10:21.040
North Korea is really, really despicable. North Korean people live in horrific conditions and get

10:21.040 --> 10:26.640
executed when they try to leave the country. It's a brutal totalitarian dictatorship and it's

10:26.640 --> 10:31.840
responsible for the biggest continuing human rights disaster in the world. When Donald Trump

10:31.840 --> 10:36.560
took office, he took a no-nonsense approach to North Korea, openly mocking their leader

10:36.560 --> 10:41.760
Kim Jong-un and threatening nuclear retaliation. And at the time, the media ripped Trump for

10:41.760 --> 10:46.960
threatening nuclear war. But it actually might have worked because on March 8th, 2018,

10:46.960 --> 10:52.560
the White House announced that Trump accepted an invitation to meet with Kim Jong-un. This is

10:52.560 --> 10:58.720
huge news. This could potentially lead to peace with America's worst foreign adversary.

10:58.720 --> 11:01.280
So let's see what Jimmy Kimmel has to say about this.

11:02.240 --> 11:09.200
President Trump appreciated the briefing and said he would meet Kim Jong-un by May.

11:10.000 --> 11:15.600
By May? He's not still going to be president by May. We need to get that.

11:17.680 --> 11:23.520
Wow. Okay. So he completely takes the piss out of it and somehow manages to spin the story into

11:23.520 --> 11:30.160
anti-Trump rhetoric. This is just so stupid and counterproductive for society. And it's not just

11:30.240 --> 11:35.040
Kimmel who does this. Like I said, it's most of these late night hosts, but it's as if these guys

11:35.040 --> 11:39.840
are physically incapable of saying a single positive thing about Trump. And I don't even

11:39.840 --> 11:44.800
like Trump and I disagree with a lot of his policies, but this anti-Trump bias in the media

11:44.800 --> 11:50.560
has become laughably absurd. Trump could cure cancer and bring world peace in the same day,

11:50.560 --> 11:54.880
and the American media would still find a way to spin it into a negative. Trump is here

11:54.880 --> 12:03.680
potentially making peace with North Korea and all Jimbo can say is, and then he expects to be taken

12:03.680 --> 12:08.800
seriously as a political commentator. Also, I don't buy that he's just a comedian making fun

12:08.800 --> 12:13.760
of topical events. Kimmel and these other late night hosts never went after Obama to the extent

12:13.760 --> 12:18.960
they attacked Trump. And I don't care how much you don't like Trump. It's ethically irresponsible for

12:18.960 --> 12:24.480
Kimmel and the rest of these talking heads to inject their political bias in American society.

12:24.480 --> 12:30.240
The media has gone so berserk with this anti-Trump agenda that it's bordering on propaganda at this

12:30.240 --> 12:35.920
point. I find it funny how a month ago the media was actually sympathizing with North Korea just

12:35.920 --> 12:40.800
to spite Donald Trump. These people are so delusional in their belief that Trump is this

12:40.800 --> 12:46.400
fascist incarnation of Hitler that they're willing to side with a literal fascist dictatorship just

12:46.400 --> 12:57.920
to be contrarian to the president. Oh well anyway here's another segment mocking the president. Man

12:57.920 --> 13:02.320
isn't it messed up how Trump has done some sexually questionable things in the past?

13:02.320 --> 13:06.240
Coming up next is an interview with former alleged rapist Kobe Bryant.

13:06.240 --> 13:25.920
Bernie Sanders or Hillary Clinton?

13:30.400 --> 13:35.360
What I do like about Bernie is that when he loses because the system is rigged against him totally

13:35.360 --> 13:39.760
just like it was rigged against me I mean the system is rigged and if I didn't win by massive

13:39.760 --> 13:45.200
landslides every state I would there was no chance that I could have won. But it's what started Amy's

13:45.200 --> 13:56.240
downward spiral or upward spiral of her giant massive ego. So let's talk about celebrities.

13:56.240 --> 14:02.000
Americans are obsessed with them. There are people in this country who will literally saw off their

14:02.000 --> 14:07.680
own limbs just for the opportunity to be spat on by their favorite celebrities. Celebrity culture

14:07.680 --> 14:12.800
in America is toxic, parasocial, and I've always hated it. I understand that it's important to

14:12.800 --> 14:17.600
appreciate and respect talented people but Americans tend to accentuate these principles

14:17.600 --> 14:22.560
to the point of celebrity worship and when you place celebrities on these impossibly high

14:22.560 --> 14:27.440
pedestals you start to forget that celebrities are just as flawed as the rest of us. And it's

14:27.440 --> 14:32.480
talk shows like Jimmy Kimmel Live that really perpetuate America's celebrity obsession.

14:32.480 --> 14:37.120
Celebrities and talk show hosts have a symbiotic relationship. The celebrity benefits by having

14:37.120 --> 14:42.320
their book, movie, or album promoted to a national audience and the host benefits by leeching off the

14:42.320 --> 14:48.000
celebrity's fame. Celebrity interviews have allowed relatively untalented people like Jimmy Kimmel to

14:48.000 --> 14:52.720
become celebrities in their own right. Americans just see Kimmel on the same screen as their

14:52.720 --> 14:58.080
favorite celebrities and they begin to associate him as equal status. It's simple Pavlovian

14:58.080 --> 15:01.920
conditioning. But I'm not here to complain about Jimmy Kimmel interviewing celebrities.

15:01.920 --> 15:05.920
I understand that celebrity interviews are a routine part of every talk show.

15:05.920 --> 15:10.720
I'm just pointing out that it's a bit hypocritical of Jimmy Kimmel to lampoon Trump's sexually

15:10.720 --> 15:15.840
questionable past and then 10 minutes later have a pleasant chat with Kobe Bryant. I mean come on,

15:15.840 --> 15:22.320
the guy spent a year in a rape trial in 2003 and to do this during a time when all of Hollywood is

15:22.320 --> 15:28.080
tainted with allegations of sexual misconduct it just reeks of a double standard. And you can see

15:28.080 --> 15:33.280
this double standard on full display during Jimmy Kimmel's recent monologue at the Oscars.

15:33.280 --> 15:37.840
Watch how he downplays Hollywood's sexual misconduct by labeling it as a men's issue

15:37.840 --> 15:42.160
rather than a Hollywood issue. But what happened with Harvey and what's happening all over was

15:42.160 --> 15:47.040
long overdue. We can't let bad behavior slide anymore. The world is watching us. We need to

15:47.040 --> 15:51.920
set an example and the truth is if we are successful here if we can work together to

15:51.920 --> 15:57.360
stop sexual harassment in the workplace if we can do that women will only have to deal with

15:57.360 --> 16:03.840
harassment all the time at every other place they go. Wow. And this is just such a scummy thing to

16:03.840 --> 16:10.400
say. No Jimmy the rest of society doesn't sexually harass women. How dare you condescend and slander

16:10.400 --> 16:15.040
the rest of us for something we don't even do. I've never sexually assaulted a woman. I don't

16:15.040 --> 16:19.520
associate with anyone who's ever sexually assaulted a woman. The vast majority of men

16:19.520 --> 16:25.200
in society have never sexually assaulted a woman. Men who do sexually assault women get promptly

16:25.200 --> 16:30.320
punished and ostracized for it and the only men who sexually assault women and get away with it

16:30.320 --> 16:35.600
are rich powerful men like the ones in your industry. But go ahead downplay all the sexual

16:35.600 --> 16:41.440
abuse in Hollywood by spreading lies misinformation and irrational fear to the rest of society.

16:41.440 --> 16:46.000
Kind of ironic how you're preaching to the rest of us to respect women Jimmy considering some of

16:46.000 --> 16:50.960
your past work. Let me show you guys a little segment conducted by Jimmy Kimmel called Guess

16:50.960 --> 16:55.520
What's in My Pants. I'm just going to let the footage speak for itself. And you're allowed to

16:55.520 --> 17:02.720
feel around on the outside of the pants you'll have 10 seconds to then guess what is in my pants.

17:02.720 --> 17:09.440
How old are you? 18. Okay good you're sure of that because Uncle Jimmy doesn't need to do time.

17:09.440 --> 17:15.920
Feel harder feel a little bit faster squeeze squeeze maybe it would be easier if you put

17:15.920 --> 17:25.040
your mouth on it. Yes oh my goodness. Women will only have to deal with harassment all the time

17:25.040 --> 17:31.760
at every other place they go. Wow that's pretty bad that's YouTube prank channel's level of bad.

17:31.760 --> 17:37.520
And you're allowed to feel around on the outside of the pants you have 10 seconds to then guess

17:37.520 --> 17:46.320
what is in my pants. Now I don't watch the Oscars. Most of the time the best film doesn't win

17:46.320 --> 17:50.960
and the whole program is infested with celebrity fileting and social justice lecturing.

17:50.960 --> 17:56.800
Jimmy Kimmel's Oscars were no exception. None other than President Trump called Get Out the best

17:56.800 --> 18:01.520
first three quarters of a movie this year. And I find it interesting that Jimmy Kimmel is so

18:01.520 --> 18:06.160
progressive and cares so much about social justice you almost forget that it's coming

18:06.160 --> 18:14.320
from the same guys who made this. Sometime at night Pablo look up in the sky and say.

18:14.880 --> 18:19.280
What the hell going on up there? Do UFOs live on another planet?

18:19.280 --> 18:27.760
Phone and home like E.T. Come on read on TV. This is blackface.

18:38.960 --> 18:43.520
Wow okay so it turns out Jimmy Kimmel has done some pretty racially and sexually questionable

18:43.520 --> 18:48.320
stuff in the past. Well at least he doesn't stand up there and pretend he's morally superior to the

18:48.320 --> 18:58.480
rest of us. Right? Ask yourself this if Jimmy Kimmel is so unoriginal and unfunny then why

18:58.480 --> 19:03.360
hasn't he been replaced? He's not as funny as Jimmy Fallon. His political commentary is far

19:03.360 --> 19:08.480
worse than Colbert's so why does the network keep him around? Why is he given the privilege of

19:08.480 --> 19:15.040
hosting the Oscars? What element gives Jimmy Kimmel any value at all? Well you see every now and then

19:15.040 --> 19:21.680
Jimmy Kimmel likes to get up on his little soapbox and give a big fat speech. We saw it last year

19:21.680 --> 19:26.880
after the Vegas shooting where Jimmy Kimmel gave a deep impassioned speech with tears in his eyes

19:26.880 --> 19:33.200
about the horrendous tragedy which he monetized on YouTube. But yeah big boy Jimmy standing up

19:33.200 --> 19:39.040
to the evil NRA and those evil Republicans who want people to die in mass shootings and people

19:39.040 --> 19:44.080
love these speeches. People call Jimmy Kimmel a hero for standing up and being the self-appointed

19:44.080 --> 19:49.120
moral compass of America. Well I'm here to say that's all a bunch of bullshit. Jimmy Kimmel is

19:49.120 --> 19:54.320
just manipulating people's emotions after a tragedy and misleading the public just to inflate

19:54.320 --> 20:00.560
his ego and push his political agenda. Gun violence in America is an incredibly complex

20:00.560 --> 20:06.320
issue with no definite solution yet people like Jimmy Kimmel use every single mass shooting as

20:06.320 --> 20:11.520
a vehicle to ram the gun control arguments down our throats. Now I want to make this perfectly

20:11.520 --> 20:17.600
clear I don't like guns and I don't like the NRA but this notion that banning guns will magically

20:17.600 --> 20:22.560
stop gun violence in America is completely ridiculous and every one of these talking heads

20:22.560 --> 20:26.720
like Jimmy Kimmel pushed this point that all these tragedies could have been prevented if there were

20:26.720 --> 20:32.240
just a few more gun laws in place. That's the basis of their entire argument and it completely

20:32.240 --> 20:37.760
oversimplifies the issue into oblivion while shutting down genuine discussion. Jimmy Kimmel

20:37.760 --> 20:42.800
fools people into thinking that solving gun crime is as easy as banning assault rifles and they

20:42.800 --> 20:48.400
think you support mass shootings if you disagree with that. Because it's too soon well maybe it's

20:48.400 --> 20:54.480
too soon for you because deep down inside you know in your heart you know you bear some responsibility

20:54.480 --> 20:58.880
for the fact that almost anyone can get any weapon they want now you want to cover yourself

20:58.880 --> 21:03.840
until the storm of outrage passes you can go back to your dirty business as usual. Never mind the

21:03.840 --> 21:08.640
fact that the vast vast majority of gun violence in America is carried out with handguns in the

21:08.640 --> 21:14.400
inner cities banning guns is common sense and if you disagree you're basically a child murderer.

21:14.400 --> 21:19.280
It's completely reductive reasoning that does nothing to help the problem and people like Jimmy

21:19.280 --> 21:25.760
Kimmel do this with every political issue. Oh fixing education is so simple just throw more

21:25.760 --> 21:30.480
money at it it doesn't matter that the U.S. has tripled their education spending since the 70s

21:30.480 --> 21:35.520
and test scores haven't improved if you disagree then you must hate teachers and children and the

21:35.520 --> 21:40.240
republicans do it too. Oh what's that you don't think we should spend 50 quintillion dollars on

21:40.240 --> 21:45.280
the military? I guess you want America to be weak and defenseless. When you oversimplify an issue

21:45.280 --> 21:50.880
to that extent you end up misleading society and derailing the discussion away from real solutions

21:50.880 --> 21:55.760
and Jimmy Kimmel does this with every one of his little speeches and yeah I get that he has good

21:55.760 --> 22:00.880
intentions and all but Jimmy Kimmel is an entertainer he doesn't know a thing about politics

22:00.880 --> 22:06.160
yet people listen to him as if he's some kind of expert he sure thinks he's an expert earlier this

22:06.160 --> 22:11.840
year he said you gotta be smart to be a liberal he really played the to be fair you have to have a

22:11.840 --> 22:17.600
very high IQ to be liberal card man you know for a party of such brilliant people you guys sure do

22:17.600 --> 22:23.360
lose a lot but that can't possibly be because of your own flaws no it's the fault of those dumb

22:23.360 --> 22:28.640
evil racist republican voters I'm sure this year's oscars had the lowest viewership of all time

22:28.640 --> 22:33.600
because anyone who didn't watch it hates women and minorities and supports shooting children

22:33.600 --> 22:39.360
I'm so sick of these smug liberal hollywood millionaires who think they know what's best

22:39.360 --> 22:43.840
for America do you ever think people get tired of listening to you insult the president every

22:43.840 --> 22:49.440
five seconds do you think innocent people enjoy getting called racist sexist child murderers just

22:49.440 --> 22:53.520
because they disagree with you because it's not like the vast majority of conservatives vote

22:53.520 --> 22:59.760
republican because they want to pay lower taxes or anything nope they're racist bigots all of them

22:59.760 --> 23:04.240
we should know since we're such intelligent liberals and all these rich hollywood liberals

23:04.240 --> 23:08.400
like Jimmy Kimmel think they're such heroes for pretending that race relations are still a serious

23:08.400 --> 23:13.200
problem in America you want to be a hero Jimmy how about you use one of your speeches to talk

23:13.200 --> 23:17.760
about real issues maybe talk about the massive health crisis in America that's just been

23:17.760 --> 23:22.880
happening under our noses maybe talk about how one out of every three Americans is fatter than

23:22.880 --> 23:27.600
the michelin man maybe talk about solutions to a broken public school system that doesn't involve

23:27.600 --> 23:32.240
just throwing more money at it because I don't see why it's still necessary to force kids to

23:32.240 --> 23:37.440
waste six hours a day five days a week 180 days a year to sit in a place they don't want to be

23:37.440 --> 23:42.480
when the internet exists maybe talk about how America's flawed infrastructure and urban design

23:42.480 --> 23:47.440
has directly disadvantaged the working class maybe talk about how huge corporations practically

23:47.440 --> 23:52.560
manipulate American lawmaking to maximize their profits by as much as possible maybe talk about

23:52.560 --> 23:57.440
how the war on drugs has turned millions of regular recreational drug users into dangerous

23:57.440 --> 24:02.080
hardened criminals maybe talk about the military industrial complex and why we're still fighting a

24:02.080 --> 24:07.920
war on terror 17 years after 9 11 maybe instead of vaguely preaching at people to stop global

24:07.920 --> 24:14.240
warming you offer some actual solutions talk about the disastrous ecological impact of factory farming

24:14.240 --> 24:19.120
encourage people to go vegan hell you could have talked about the rampant sexual misconduct in

24:19.120 --> 24:24.160
your industry happening during your entire tenure before it became a public affair you could have

24:24.160 --> 24:29.040
talked about all of these real problems in America but you don't because I guess it's just easier to

24:29.040 --> 24:34.480
pretend that America is this bigoted hellhole and to get called heroic and brave for standing up to

24:34.480 --> 24:40.480
a fake problem that you made up you keep perpetuating this nebulous agenda of racial and social

24:40.480 --> 24:45.680
justice as if the civil rights movement never happened I get that maybe one out of ten thousand

24:45.680 --> 24:50.960
people in America are still overtly racist but who gives a shit about them let them be racist

24:50.960 --> 24:55.760
it's just an opinion how are we going to get rid of racism and stop talking about it

24:56.720 --> 25:02.480
stop punishing the rest of us just because a tiny sliver of people have bad opinions your divisive

25:02.480 --> 25:08.240
rhetoric is turning Americans against each other for no reason and making society a worse place

25:08.240 --> 25:13.280
Americans can't turn on late night talk shows anymore without being scolded for stuff they

25:13.280 --> 25:18.480
don't do and don't believe it's so ironic that most of these people who demonize the rich white

25:18.480 --> 25:23.920
elite are themselves part of the rich white elite these people have surrounded themselves with a

25:23.920 --> 25:29.040
cocoon of yes-men who agree with all their stupid ideas while shutting out anyone who even

25:29.040 --> 25:34.400
questions their delusional agenda they have lost sight of America's real problems so they have to

25:34.400 --> 25:39.680
invent all these dumb made-up problems like microaggressions and representation in movies

25:39.680 --> 25:44.960
it's like they're so out of touch with real people thanks to their inbreeding of ideas

25:44.960 --> 25:50.080
that they have no clue what's actually going on in America doesn't it bother you guys that you don't

25:50.080 --> 25:52.560
bother you guys that you don't know anything

25:57.040 --> 26:01.200
weren't you a friend of hill like a good friend of hillary clinton's at one point

26:01.200 --> 26:08.160
now i know you you're very very down on her what happened i had some i had some disagreement

26:08.160 --> 26:14.160
with her foreign policy i see with her foreign policy dan's character is not did you did you

26:14.160 --> 26:20.000
agree with her foreign policy listen never mind her foreign policy how about captain wacko we

26:20.000 --> 26:27.760
got running the country here i mean foreign policy i'm shocked because i know you're you

26:27.760 --> 26:33.520
were a very liberal socially liberal person in general i mean i'm still the same you all

26:34.080 --> 26:38.160
moved we did you all went so far out you lost him

26:38.480 --> 26:46.320
a lot of us you know no matter who we voted for we don't want to see our president fail

26:46.880 --> 26:54.720
just chill just chill you know try to think positive for like why people wanted to change

26:55.680 --> 27:03.920
and it's up to the people here's my two cents damn it okay it's up to us to make this government work

27:03.920 --> 27:10.800
no matter who's president it's up to us to do our jobs as citizens and if we don't like something

27:11.360 --> 27:15.760
you know let them know you don't like it and then you got another election in two years

27:15.760 --> 27:21.680
get out there and bow you listen you're expressing your views as crazy as they may be

27:22.000 --> 27:35.440
so why did i make this video all you ever do is complain why do i even care what jimmy kimmel

27:35.440 --> 27:41.680
says or does well can i just say this real quick have you noticed that liberals have gone completely

27:41.680 --> 27:47.360
insane and it's not all of them but it's certainly more than a healthy amount for society i mean

27:47.360 --> 27:52.640
just look at what some of these people are doing and saying these people are clinically insane

27:52.640 --> 27:57.200
and there's a ton of them you want to know why liberals keep losing in america

27:57.200 --> 28:02.320
maybe it's because a big chunk of your party has gone off the deep end you liberals are so

28:02.320 --> 28:08.000
confused as to why people are choosing republicans over you when the answer is so simple all you have

28:08.000 --> 28:13.600
to do to beat the republicans is be the less ignorant party all you have to do is be more

28:13.600 --> 28:20.160
rational than info wars people and you have somehow failed to do that it's a complete joke

28:20.160 --> 28:25.200
and don't assume i'm making this video just to bash liberals personally i think society functions

28:25.200 --> 28:30.160
a lot better when liberals don't act completely insane and there was a time not too long ago when

28:30.160 --> 28:34.800
liberals were the far more rational party that was back when they actually cared about helping

28:34.800 --> 28:41.120
disadvantaged people and in just a decade or so you liberals have somehow taken that simple idea

28:41.120 --> 28:46.000
and corrupted it into bullying anyone who disagrees with you by calling them racist

28:46.000 --> 28:52.800
nowadays rather than helping the poor or the sick it's all about helping the blacks and the gays

28:53.440 --> 28:59.280
liberals don't treat people like people anymore it's all about dividing up everyone by their skin

28:59.280 --> 29:04.320
color gender and sexuality the very same principles that real liberals fought against in

29:04.320 --> 29:09.280
the 60s many of today's liberals will tell you that there's no such thing as a poor white person

29:09.280 --> 29:14.160
because they genuinely believe that the color of your skin somehow makes you privileged

29:14.160 --> 29:20.000
this toxic belief system is destroying western civilization and it's seeping into some of the

29:20.000 --> 29:25.520
most powerful institutions of society some of these liberals certainly belong in an institution

29:25.520 --> 29:31.360
and that raises the question what went wrong how did these liberals become so delusional well i

29:31.360 --> 29:37.120
think the answer to that can be found every weeknight on abc at 11 35 you're what's wrong

29:37.120 --> 29:42.560
with america get off the stage you have guys like jimmy kimmel who have this huge platform

29:42.560 --> 29:48.800
and a ton of influence espousing their uninformed political opinions and americans just buy into it

29:48.800 --> 29:53.840
these guys get all riled up and emotional and say a bunch of stuff that sounds good in the moment

29:53.840 --> 29:58.800
and people fall for those ideas without even thinking jimmy kimmel's rise to prominence is

29:58.800 --> 30:04.480
a cautionary tale of trust and loyalty for some reason many americans trust celebrities and

30:04.480 --> 30:09.680
entertainers so much that they're willing to blindly accept any of their opinions as true

30:09.680 --> 30:15.200
because here in america we love our celebrities and how can a celebrity be wrong about anything

30:15.200 --> 30:19.760
but it's important to remember that hollywood is a place where some of the most talented people in

30:19.760 --> 30:25.600
the world come together to produce great works of fiction but fiction isn't real and when you

30:25.600 --> 30:30.400
surround yourself with nothing but fiction don't be surprised when you start to lose touch with

30:30.400 --> 30:35.280
reality so i guess the lesson of today's video is jimmy kimmel is a talentless hack and he's

30:35.280 --> 30:40.320
polluting the public agenda with dumb ideas so do yourself a favor and stop getting your political

30:40.320 --> 30:45.520
and moral guidance from a guy who performed in blackface on national television oh but then again

30:45.520 --> 30:50.000
what do i know i'm just a guy who complains about memes memes are dumb and stupid i have no idea

30:50.000 --> 30:56.720
what i'm talking about i'm sure uh-oh looks like emp lemon is back on the downward spiral again

30:56.720 --> 31:02.800
tune in next month when emp complains about something else emperor lemon's never-ending

31:02.800 --> 31:09.840
downward spiral world tour is brought to you by patreon volto lonbo etienne senpai

31:09.840 --> 31:17.600
haha i saw these guides a whole day ago and by viewers like you thank you you know i thought i

got out of the downward spiral for a little bit just as i was pulling myself over the edge it put

31:24.960 --> 31:31.840
me back at the beginning it put me back to the bottom it just resets itself there's no way to

31:31.840 --> 31:38.640
get out of the downward spiral it's an infinite loop and i've never been more at the bottom

31:40.000 --> 31:43.200
