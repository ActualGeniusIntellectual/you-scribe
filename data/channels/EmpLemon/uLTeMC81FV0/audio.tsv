0	5200	So the other day I had an epiphany. I was bored and flipping through channels on TV and I happened
5200	11440	to stumble upon Jimmy Kimmel Live and for the first time ever I started watching Jimmy Kimmel.
11440	18400	I sat down and watched this program for about 15 minutes and it was genuinely, no joke, some of the
18400	23840	most god-awful content I have ever seen on television. If you haven't watched a full episode
23840	28800	of Jimmy Kimmel, the closest thing I could compare it to would be watching an old tortoise slowly
28800	34880	cross a highway at rush hour. There's just an odd looming feeling of disgust that's difficult for
34880	41200	me to describe and that's when it hit me. I cannot stand Jimmy Kimmel. Jimmy Kimmel is one of the
41200	47120	most insufferable individuals I've ever witnessed. I have a theory that no one actually likes Jimmy
47120	52400	Kimmel. I think at most people just tolerate him. I find it really hard to believe that there are
52400	58400	any die-hard Jimmy Kimmel fans out there. There may be people that like the show but I just don't
58400	63920	buy that anyone likes him. But by the same token, most people don't really dislike him either. He's
63920	68560	a guy who most of the time is just so bland and uninteresting that nobody really pays attention
68560	75040	to him and Jimmy Kimmel has used this tactic of being just bland enough to slowly wriggle his way
75040	80560	into the flesh of popular culture. I think most people just assume that because Jimmy Kimmel is
80560	84880	everywhere, then he must be some really talented and respected guy that everyone loves. It's like
84880	89440	the Emperor's New Clothes. Everyone just assumes Jimmy Kimmel is this really great guy and no one
89440	94480	really questions it. But when you dig a little bit deeper, you'll find that Jimmy Kimmel is actually a
94480	100640	very problematic individual. In fact, Jimmy Kimmel is emblematic of some very troubling issues in
100640	105760	American society as a whole. And before I jump into why, it's important to recognize that when I talk
105760	110880	about Jimmy Kimmel, I'm talking about the persona he portrays on television. I don't know the guy,
110880	116960	maybe he's a really good dude off screen. But on screen, Jimmy Kimmel is a cultural tumor and I
116960	123280	don't think anybody realizes just how bad he is. This is the definitive Jimmy Kimmel rant.
140880	150640	So let's start with the obvious here. Jimmy Kimmel is supposedly a comedian, yet his show isn't really
150640	155760	that funny. And yeah, yeah, I get that humorous objective and whatever, but Jimmy Kimmel is one of
155760	161760	the least funny comedians I have ever seen. And a lot of people would probably agree with me on this.
161760	167280	Let me put it to you this way. Watching Jimmy Kimmel is like watching a try to laugh challenge.
167280	173360	It's actually somewhat fascinating how unfunny this show is. Winter Storm Quinn as the Weather
173360	177920	Channel, uh, or Winter Storm, Winter Storm Quinoa as the Food Network is calling it.
179840	184800	You can be funny by either constructing clever and well thought out jokes or by making a joke so
184800	190480	unfunny that it is funny. When Jimmy Kimmel structures his comedy, he somehow fails to land
190480	196560	on either end of the spectrum. His humor is so bland and tepid that it's actually somewhat sad.
196560	201440	It's like watching a middle-aged school teacher trying his hardest to appear funny to the students
201440	205200	even though he's completely out of touch. You almost want to throw in a pity chuckle,
205200	210400	but Kimmel delivers his jokes in such a smug and cocky way that you can't feel sorry for him.
210400	215360	He just ends up floundering on stage as you wait for him to shut up and interview a celebrity.
215360	220320	It's pretty ironic how the least entertaining part of Jimmy Kimmel Live is Jimmy Kimmel,
220320	224960	but that's nothing. I wish Jimmy Kimmel only stuck to unfunny jokes because the other stuff
224960	233600	on the show is even more problematic. So if you've ever watched any clip from Jimmy Kimmel,
233600	238720	it's probably been one of the show's side segments like mean tweets or street interviews.
238720	244960	Katy Perry has a voice that reminds me of balls covered in glass sliding down my throat.
244960	248320	They ask you how you are, you just have to say that you're fine. You're not really fine,
248320	252400	but you just can't get into it. And as far as I can tell, these segments are really hit or miss.
252400	256240	The two segments I happened to watch on TV the other day were pretty atrocious.
256240	259040	One of them was literally just making fun of a guy's foreign accent.
269600	274400	And the other was some of the most uncomfortable five minutes of television I've ever seen.
274400	278640	I hate to use the word cringe, but that's honestly all I felt when watching this segment.
278720	282400	I genuinely feel sorry for the two families who participated in this.
301520	305840	But regardless of the quality of these segments, you have to realize that they all profit off of
305840	310320	other people's content. Jimmy Kimmel takes advantage of powerless individuals to fill
310320	315040	content on his show. He's essentially doing the same thing as YouTube compilation and reaction
315040	319840	channels. Basically Jimmy Kimmel knows he's not entertaining enough to carry the show on his own,
319840	325200	so he supplements his programming with other people's ideas. He takes trendy ideas from the
325200	329840	internet and fools the public into thinking he came up with them on his own. He just plasters
329840	335680	his face and logo over real entertaining content and funnels all the credit to himself. We rip
335680	341200	apart YouTubers like SoFloAntonio for doing the same thing, yet Jimbo has been doing this stuff
341200	346880	all along on national television. I won't lie, this is definitely me when I'm driving.
346880	348480	...and several other traffic violations...
352000	354560	That's not a hit and run, that's a run and hit is what it is.
356320	362000	Funny jokes. It's just lazy and it sets a poor precedent for entertainment as a whole.
362000	366480	Why work hard to write creative and original content when you can just repost ideas and
366480	372400	entertain your audience regardless? But whatever. So what if Jimmy Kimmel profits off of unoriginal
372400	377760	and unfunny content? These things are somewhat forgivable. It's a network TV show, this kind
377760	383440	of stuff happens all over the place. So what's the big deal? And if Jimmy Kimmel only did these two
383440	389520	things, then I wouldn't be making this video. But no, old Jimbo is not satisfied with just being
389520	395840	unoriginal and unfunny. No no no, he has to actively try and warp society as he does it,
395840	401200	and that's where I draw the line. Now it's my problem.
401200	421120	So let's talk about politics. Jimmy Kimmel likes to talk about politics. Actually,
421120	424400	politics is a bit of a stretch. Jimmy Kimmel likes to talk about...
425280	438880	Donald Trump. Are you aware that Donald Trump is the President of the United States?
438880	443280	No, but seriously, this guy never shuts up about Donald Trump. And this is not really
443280	447600	all Jimmy Kimmel's fault. It's part of a larger trend that I like to call the Colbert Effect.
447600	453520	So here's a bit of background. In 2014, longtime late night TV host David Letterman retired,
453520	458560	and CBS elected to replace him with Stephen Colbert, the former host of the Colbert Report
458560	464000	on Comedy Central. The Colbert Report was a politically charged parody of Fox News hosts,
464000	468640	and Colbert himself comes from the same school of thought as outspoken liberal comedian Jon
468640	473680	Stewart. So when Colbert took over the late show, he brought his political viewpoints to a more
473680	479360	mainstream audience. And by political viewpoints, I mean bashing Donald Trump for 40 minutes straight.
479360	484560	But truth be told, Trump bashing is a good way to attract viewers. After Trump embarrassed
484560	489680	the Democrats in the 2016 election, American liberals reacted like a swarm of hornets
489680	495040	defending their nest. These bitter and delusional liberals have developed such a raging vendetta
495040	500800	against Trump and the Republicans that they will stop at no end to viciously attack anything he
500800	505760	does. Because that totally worked in the 18 months before the election. But anyway, after Trump's
505760	511360	inauguration, Colbert's late show attracted these angry liberal viewers en masse, and it became the
511360	516400	highest viewed program in its category. He took over the position from Jimmy Fallon, host of the
516400	522160	Tonight Show, who chose to downplay Trump discussion in order to preserve the comedy of his program.
522160	527920	Jimmy, this is working for other people. Maybe we should step into the anti-Trump lane and get in
527920	531600	on this. It's just not what I do. I think it'd be weird for me to start doing it now. I don't really
531600	537040	even, you know, care that much about politics. I've got to be honest, I love pop culture more than
537040	541920	I love politics. Which is actually a pretty respectable decision, although he certainly paid
541920	546560	for it in the ratings. So we've already established that Jimmy Kimmel is unoriginal and he doesn't
546560	551280	really care about comedy. So he decided to steal the idea of Trump bashing and use it in his own
551280	557040	show to try to boost his own ratings. And my lord is it obnoxious. Trump, Trump, the President.
557280	561600	President. Donald Trump. Trump. President. Trump administration. Here's the problem.
561600	566800	You can talk about serious political issues or you can have innocent family scavenger hunts.
566800	571920	But you can't have them both. I'm sorry, but people don't tune into late night talk shows
571920	578000	after a hard day of work to get lectured about how bad America is. And even the ones who do
578560	583920	won't take you seriously because five minutes later you're Skyping a dabbing suburban family.
584000	589760	You've generated a completely unnecessary conflict of interest, but Jimmy Kimmel is so desperate for
589760	595280	viewership that he tries to play both lanes and he ends up turning politics into a joke and making
595280	600480	his comedy less funny. Let's just look at this segment from the episode I watched. For those of
600480	605680	you who don't know, the U.S. and North Korea have been on bad terms since the Korean War
605680	611680	60 years ago. North Korea literally teaches anti-American propaganda in their schools,
611680	615840	which is admittedly not too different from the state of California. But seriously though,
615840	621040	North Korea is really, really despicable. North Korean people live in horrific conditions and get
621040	626640	executed when they try to leave the country. It's a brutal totalitarian dictatorship and it's
626640	631840	responsible for the biggest continuing human rights disaster in the world. When Donald Trump
631840	636560	took office, he took a no-nonsense approach to North Korea, openly mocking their leader
636560	641760	Kim Jong-un and threatening nuclear retaliation. And at the time, the media ripped Trump for
641760	646960	threatening nuclear war. But it actually might have worked because on March 8th, 2018,
646960	652560	the White House announced that Trump accepted an invitation to meet with Kim Jong-un. This is
652560	658720	huge news. This could potentially lead to peace with America's worst foreign adversary.
658720	661280	So let's see what Jimmy Kimmel has to say about this.
662240	669200	President Trump appreciated the briefing and said he would meet Kim Jong-un by May.
670000	675600	By May? He's not still going to be president by May. We need to get that.
677680	683520	Wow. Okay. So he completely takes the piss out of it and somehow manages to spin the story into
683520	690160	anti-Trump rhetoric. This is just so stupid and counterproductive for society. And it's not just
690240	695040	Kimmel who does this. Like I said, it's most of these late night hosts, but it's as if these guys
695040	699840	are physically incapable of saying a single positive thing about Trump. And I don't even
699840	704800	like Trump and I disagree with a lot of his policies, but this anti-Trump bias in the media
704800	710560	has become laughably absurd. Trump could cure cancer and bring world peace in the same day,
710560	714880	and the American media would still find a way to spin it into a negative. Trump is here
714880	723680	potentially making peace with North Korea and all Jimbo can say is, and then he expects to be taken
723680	728800	seriously as a political commentator. Also, I don't buy that he's just a comedian making fun
728800	733760	of topical events. Kimmel and these other late night hosts never went after Obama to the extent
733760	738960	they attacked Trump. And I don't care how much you don't like Trump. It's ethically irresponsible for
738960	744480	Kimmel and the rest of these talking heads to inject their political bias in American society.
744480	750240	The media has gone so berserk with this anti-Trump agenda that it's bordering on propaganda at this
750240	755920	point. I find it funny how a month ago the media was actually sympathizing with North Korea just
755920	760800	to spite Donald Trump. These people are so delusional in their belief that Trump is this
760800	766400	fascist incarnation of Hitler that they're willing to side with a literal fascist dictatorship just
766400	777920	to be contrarian to the president. Oh well anyway here's another segment mocking the president. Man
777920	782320	isn't it messed up how Trump has done some sexually questionable things in the past?
782320	786240	Coming up next is an interview with former alleged rapist Kobe Bryant.
786240	805920	Bernie Sanders or Hillary Clinton?
810400	815360	What I do like about Bernie is that when he loses because the system is rigged against him totally
815360	819760	just like it was rigged against me I mean the system is rigged and if I didn't win by massive
819760	825200	landslides every state I would there was no chance that I could have won. But it's what started Amy's
825200	836240	downward spiral or upward spiral of her giant massive ego. So let's talk about celebrities.
836240	842000	Americans are obsessed with them. There are people in this country who will literally saw off their
842000	847680	own limbs just for the opportunity to be spat on by their favorite celebrities. Celebrity culture
847680	852800	in America is toxic, parasocial, and I've always hated it. I understand that it's important to
852800	857600	appreciate and respect talented people but Americans tend to accentuate these principles
857600	862560	to the point of celebrity worship and when you place celebrities on these impossibly high
862560	867440	pedestals you start to forget that celebrities are just as flawed as the rest of us. And it's
867440	872480	talk shows like Jimmy Kimmel Live that really perpetuate America's celebrity obsession.
872480	877120	Celebrities and talk show hosts have a symbiotic relationship. The celebrity benefits by having
877120	882320	their book, movie, or album promoted to a national audience and the host benefits by leeching off the
882320	888000	celebrity's fame. Celebrity interviews have allowed relatively untalented people like Jimmy Kimmel to
888000	892720	become celebrities in their own right. Americans just see Kimmel on the same screen as their
892720	898080	favorite celebrities and they begin to associate him as equal status. It's simple Pavlovian
898080	901920	conditioning. But I'm not here to complain about Jimmy Kimmel interviewing celebrities.
901920	905920	I understand that celebrity interviews are a routine part of every talk show.
905920	910720	I'm just pointing out that it's a bit hypocritical of Jimmy Kimmel to lampoon Trump's sexually
910720	915840	questionable past and then 10 minutes later have a pleasant chat with Kobe Bryant. I mean come on,
915840	922320	the guy spent a year in a rape trial in 2003 and to do this during a time when all of Hollywood is
922320	928080	tainted with allegations of sexual misconduct it just reeks of a double standard. And you can see
928080	933280	this double standard on full display during Jimmy Kimmel's recent monologue at the Oscars.
933280	937840	Watch how he downplays Hollywood's sexual misconduct by labeling it as a men's issue
937840	942160	rather than a Hollywood issue. But what happened with Harvey and what's happening all over was
942160	947040	long overdue. We can't let bad behavior slide anymore. The world is watching us. We need to
947040	951920	set an example and the truth is if we are successful here if we can work together to
951920	957360	stop sexual harassment in the workplace if we can do that women will only have to deal with
957360	963840	harassment all the time at every other place they go. Wow. And this is just such a scummy thing to
963840	970400	say. No Jimmy the rest of society doesn't sexually harass women. How dare you condescend and slander
970400	975040	the rest of us for something we don't even do. I've never sexually assaulted a woman. I don't
975040	979520	associate with anyone who's ever sexually assaulted a woman. The vast majority of men
979520	985200	in society have never sexually assaulted a woman. Men who do sexually assault women get promptly
985200	990320	punished and ostracized for it and the only men who sexually assault women and get away with it
990320	995600	are rich powerful men like the ones in your industry. But go ahead downplay all the sexual
995600	1001440	abuse in Hollywood by spreading lies misinformation and irrational fear to the rest of society.
1001440	1006000	Kind of ironic how you're preaching to the rest of us to respect women Jimmy considering some of
1006000	1010960	your past work. Let me show you guys a little segment conducted by Jimmy Kimmel called Guess
1010960	1015520	What's in My Pants. I'm just going to let the footage speak for itself. And you're allowed to
1015520	1022720	feel around on the outside of the pants you'll have 10 seconds to then guess what is in my pants.
1022720	1029440	How old are you? 18. Okay good you're sure of that because Uncle Jimmy doesn't need to do time.
1029440	1035920	Feel harder feel a little bit faster squeeze squeeze maybe it would be easier if you put
1035920	1045040	your mouth on it. Yes oh my goodness. Women will only have to deal with harassment all the time
1045040	1051760	at every other place they go. Wow that's pretty bad that's YouTube prank channel's level of bad.
1051760	1057520	And you're allowed to feel around on the outside of the pants you have 10 seconds to then guess
1057520	1066320	what is in my pants. Now I don't watch the Oscars. Most of the time the best film doesn't win
1066320	1070960	and the whole program is infested with celebrity fileting and social justice lecturing.
1070960	1076800	Jimmy Kimmel's Oscars were no exception. None other than President Trump called Get Out the best
1076800	1081520	first three quarters of a movie this year. And I find it interesting that Jimmy Kimmel is so
1081520	1086160	progressive and cares so much about social justice you almost forget that it's coming
1086160	1094320	from the same guys who made this. Sometime at night Pablo look up in the sky and say.
1094880	1099280	What the hell going on up there? Do UFOs live on another planet?
1099280	1107760	Phone and home like E.T. Come on read on TV. This is blackface.
1118960	1123520	Wow okay so it turns out Jimmy Kimmel has done some pretty racially and sexually questionable
1123520	1128320	stuff in the past. Well at least he doesn't stand up there and pretend he's morally superior to the
1128320	1138480	rest of us. Right? Ask yourself this if Jimmy Kimmel is so unoriginal and unfunny then why
1138480	1143360	hasn't he been replaced? He's not as funny as Jimmy Fallon. His political commentary is far
1143360	1148480	worse than Colbert's so why does the network keep him around? Why is he given the privilege of
1148480	1155040	hosting the Oscars? What element gives Jimmy Kimmel any value at all? Well you see every now and then
1155040	1161680	Jimmy Kimmel likes to get up on his little soapbox and give a big fat speech. We saw it last year
1161680	1166880	after the Vegas shooting where Jimmy Kimmel gave a deep impassioned speech with tears in his eyes
1166880	1173200	about the horrendous tragedy which he monetized on YouTube. But yeah big boy Jimmy standing up
1173200	1179040	to the evil NRA and those evil Republicans who want people to die in mass shootings and people
1179040	1184080	love these speeches. People call Jimmy Kimmel a hero for standing up and being the self-appointed
1184080	1189120	moral compass of America. Well I'm here to say that's all a bunch of bullshit. Jimmy Kimmel is
1189120	1194320	just manipulating people's emotions after a tragedy and misleading the public just to inflate
1194320	1200560	his ego and push his political agenda. Gun violence in America is an incredibly complex
1200560	1206320	issue with no definite solution yet people like Jimmy Kimmel use every single mass shooting as
1206320	1211520	a vehicle to ram the gun control arguments down our throats. Now I want to make this perfectly
1211520	1217600	clear I don't like guns and I don't like the NRA but this notion that banning guns will magically
1217600	1222560	stop gun violence in America is completely ridiculous and every one of these talking heads
1222560	1226720	like Jimmy Kimmel pushed this point that all these tragedies could have been prevented if there were
1226720	1232240	just a few more gun laws in place. That's the basis of their entire argument and it completely
1232240	1237760	oversimplifies the issue into oblivion while shutting down genuine discussion. Jimmy Kimmel
1237760	1242800	fools people into thinking that solving gun crime is as easy as banning assault rifles and they
1242800	1248400	think you support mass shootings if you disagree with that. Because it's too soon well maybe it's
1248400	1254480	too soon for you because deep down inside you know in your heart you know you bear some responsibility
1254480	1258880	for the fact that almost anyone can get any weapon they want now you want to cover yourself
1258880	1263840	until the storm of outrage passes you can go back to your dirty business as usual. Never mind the
1263840	1268640	fact that the vast vast majority of gun violence in America is carried out with handguns in the
1268640	1274400	inner cities banning guns is common sense and if you disagree you're basically a child murderer.
1274400	1279280	It's completely reductive reasoning that does nothing to help the problem and people like Jimmy
1279280	1285760	Kimmel do this with every political issue. Oh fixing education is so simple just throw more
1285760	1290480	money at it it doesn't matter that the U.S. has tripled their education spending since the 70s
1290480	1295520	and test scores haven't improved if you disagree then you must hate teachers and children and the
1295520	1300240	republicans do it too. Oh what's that you don't think we should spend 50 quintillion dollars on
1300240	1305280	the military? I guess you want America to be weak and defenseless. When you oversimplify an issue
1305280	1310880	to that extent you end up misleading society and derailing the discussion away from real solutions
1310880	1315760	and Jimmy Kimmel does this with every one of his little speeches and yeah I get that he has good
1315760	1320880	intentions and all but Jimmy Kimmel is an entertainer he doesn't know a thing about politics
1320880	1326160	yet people listen to him as if he's some kind of expert he sure thinks he's an expert earlier this
1326160	1331840	year he said you gotta be smart to be a liberal he really played the to be fair you have to have a
1331840	1337600	very high IQ to be liberal card man you know for a party of such brilliant people you guys sure do
1337600	1343360	lose a lot but that can't possibly be because of your own flaws no it's the fault of those dumb
1343360	1348640	evil racist republican voters I'm sure this year's oscars had the lowest viewership of all time
1348640	1353600	because anyone who didn't watch it hates women and minorities and supports shooting children
1353600	1359360	I'm so sick of these smug liberal hollywood millionaires who think they know what's best
1359360	1363840	for America do you ever think people get tired of listening to you insult the president every
1363840	1369440	five seconds do you think innocent people enjoy getting called racist sexist child murderers just
1369440	1373520	because they disagree with you because it's not like the vast majority of conservatives vote
1373520	1379760	republican because they want to pay lower taxes or anything nope they're racist bigots all of them
1379760	1384240	we should know since we're such intelligent liberals and all these rich hollywood liberals
1384240	1388400	like Jimmy Kimmel think they're such heroes for pretending that race relations are still a serious
1388400	1393200	problem in America you want to be a hero Jimmy how about you use one of your speeches to talk
1393200	1397760	about real issues maybe talk about the massive health crisis in America that's just been
1397760	1402880	happening under our noses maybe talk about how one out of every three Americans is fatter than
1402880	1407600	the michelin man maybe talk about solutions to a broken public school system that doesn't involve
1407600	1412240	just throwing more money at it because I don't see why it's still necessary to force kids to
1412240	1417440	waste six hours a day five days a week 180 days a year to sit in a place they don't want to be
1417440	1422480	when the internet exists maybe talk about how America's flawed infrastructure and urban design
1422480	1427440	has directly disadvantaged the working class maybe talk about how huge corporations practically
1427440	1432560	manipulate American lawmaking to maximize their profits by as much as possible maybe talk about
1432560	1437440	how the war on drugs has turned millions of regular recreational drug users into dangerous
1437440	1442080	hardened criminals maybe talk about the military industrial complex and why we're still fighting a
1442080	1447920	war on terror 17 years after 9 11 maybe instead of vaguely preaching at people to stop global
1447920	1454240	warming you offer some actual solutions talk about the disastrous ecological impact of factory farming
1454240	1459120	encourage people to go vegan hell you could have talked about the rampant sexual misconduct in
1459120	1464160	your industry happening during your entire tenure before it became a public affair you could have
1464160	1469040	talked about all of these real problems in America but you don't because I guess it's just easier to
1469040	1474480	pretend that America is this bigoted hellhole and to get called heroic and brave for standing up to
1474480	1480480	a fake problem that you made up you keep perpetuating this nebulous agenda of racial and social
1480480	1485680	justice as if the civil rights movement never happened I get that maybe one out of ten thousand
1485680	1490960	people in America are still overtly racist but who gives a shit about them let them be racist
1490960	1495760	it's just an opinion how are we going to get rid of racism and stop talking about it
1496720	1502480	stop punishing the rest of us just because a tiny sliver of people have bad opinions your divisive
1502480	1508240	rhetoric is turning Americans against each other for no reason and making society a worse place
1508240	1513280	Americans can't turn on late night talk shows anymore without being scolded for stuff they
1513280	1518480	don't do and don't believe it's so ironic that most of these people who demonize the rich white
1518480	1523920	elite are themselves part of the rich white elite these people have surrounded themselves with a
1523920	1529040	cocoon of yes-men who agree with all their stupid ideas while shutting out anyone who even
1529040	1534400	questions their delusional agenda they have lost sight of America's real problems so they have to
1534400	1539680	invent all these dumb made-up problems like microaggressions and representation in movies
1539680	1544960	it's like they're so out of touch with real people thanks to their inbreeding of ideas
1544960	1550080	that they have no clue what's actually going on in America doesn't it bother you guys that you don't
1550080	1552560	bother you guys that you don't know anything
1557040	1561200	weren't you a friend of hill like a good friend of hillary clinton's at one point
1561200	1568160	now i know you you're very very down on her what happened i had some i had some disagreement
1568160	1574160	with her foreign policy i see with her foreign policy dan's character is not did you did you
1574160	1580000	agree with her foreign policy listen never mind her foreign policy how about captain wacko we
1580000	1587760	got running the country here i mean foreign policy i'm shocked because i know you're you
1587760	1593520	were a very liberal socially liberal person in general i mean i'm still the same you all
1594080	1598160	moved we did you all went so far out you lost him
1598480	1606320	a lot of us you know no matter who we voted for we don't want to see our president fail
1606880	1614720	just chill just chill you know try to think positive for like why people wanted to change
1615680	1623920	and it's up to the people here's my two cents damn it okay it's up to us to make this government work
1623920	1630800	no matter who's president it's up to us to do our jobs as citizens and if we don't like something
1631360	1635760	you know let them know you don't like it and then you got another election in two years
1635760	1641680	get out there and bow you listen you're expressing your views as crazy as they may be
1642000	1655440	so why did i make this video all you ever do is complain why do i even care what jimmy kimmel
1655440	1661680	says or does well can i just say this real quick have you noticed that liberals have gone completely
1661680	1667360	insane and it's not all of them but it's certainly more than a healthy amount for society i mean
1667360	1672640	just look at what some of these people are doing and saying these people are clinically insane
1672640	1677200	and there's a ton of them you want to know why liberals keep losing in america
1677200	1682320	maybe it's because a big chunk of your party has gone off the deep end you liberals are so
1682320	1688000	confused as to why people are choosing republicans over you when the answer is so simple all you have
1688000	1693600	to do to beat the republicans is be the less ignorant party all you have to do is be more
1693600	1700160	rational than info wars people and you have somehow failed to do that it's a complete joke
1700160	1705200	and don't assume i'm making this video just to bash liberals personally i think society functions
1705200	1710160	a lot better when liberals don't act completely insane and there was a time not too long ago when
1710160	1714800	liberals were the far more rational party that was back when they actually cared about helping
1714800	1721120	disadvantaged people and in just a decade or so you liberals have somehow taken that simple idea
1721120	1726000	and corrupted it into bullying anyone who disagrees with you by calling them racist
1726000	1732800	nowadays rather than helping the poor or the sick it's all about helping the blacks and the gays
1733440	1739280	liberals don't treat people like people anymore it's all about dividing up everyone by their skin
1739280	1744320	color gender and sexuality the very same principles that real liberals fought against in
1744320	1749280	the 60s many of today's liberals will tell you that there's no such thing as a poor white person
1749280	1754160	because they genuinely believe that the color of your skin somehow makes you privileged
1754160	1760000	this toxic belief system is destroying western civilization and it's seeping into some of the
1760000	1765520	most powerful institutions of society some of these liberals certainly belong in an institution
1765520	1771360	and that raises the question what went wrong how did these liberals become so delusional well i
1771360	1777120	think the answer to that can be found every weeknight on abc at 11 35 you're what's wrong
1777120	1782560	with america get off the stage you have guys like jimmy kimmel who have this huge platform
1782560	1788800	and a ton of influence espousing their uninformed political opinions and americans just buy into it
1788800	1793840	these guys get all riled up and emotional and say a bunch of stuff that sounds good in the moment
1793840	1798800	and people fall for those ideas without even thinking jimmy kimmel's rise to prominence is
1798800	1804480	a cautionary tale of trust and loyalty for some reason many americans trust celebrities and
1804480	1809680	entertainers so much that they're willing to blindly accept any of their opinions as true
1809680	1815200	because here in america we love our celebrities and how can a celebrity be wrong about anything
1815200	1819760	but it's important to remember that hollywood is a place where some of the most talented people in
1819760	1825600	the world come together to produce great works of fiction but fiction isn't real and when you
1825600	1830400	surround yourself with nothing but fiction don't be surprised when you start to lose touch with
1830400	1835280	reality so i guess the lesson of today's video is jimmy kimmel is a talentless hack and he's
1835280	1840320	polluting the public agenda with dumb ideas so do yourself a favor and stop getting your political
1840320	1845520	and moral guidance from a guy who performed in blackface on national television oh but then again
1845520	1850000	what do i know i'm just a guy who complains about memes memes are dumb and stupid i have no idea
