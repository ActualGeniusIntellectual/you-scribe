1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,200
So the other day I had an epiphany. I was bored and flipping through channels on TV and I happened

2
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:11,440
to stumble upon Jimmy Kimmel Live and for the first time ever I started watching Jimmy Kimmel.

3
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:18,400
I sat down and watched this program for about 15 minutes and it was genuinely, no joke, some of the

4
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:23,840
most god-awful content I have ever seen on television. If you haven't watched a full episode

5
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:28,800
of Jimmy Kimmel, the closest thing I could compare it to would be watching an old tortoise slowly

6
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:34,880
cross a highway at rush hour. There's just an odd looming feeling of disgust that's difficult for

7
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:41,200
me to describe and that's when it hit me. I cannot stand Jimmy Kimmel. Jimmy Kimmel is one of the

8
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:47,120
most insufferable individuals I've ever witnessed. I have a theory that no one actually likes Jimmy

9
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:52,400
Kimmel. I think at most people just tolerate him. I find it really hard to believe that there are

10
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:58,400
any die-hard Jimmy Kimmel fans out there. There may be people that like the show but I just don't

11
00:00:58,400 --> 00:01:03,920
buy that anyone likes him. But by the same token, most people don't really dislike him either. He's

12
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:08,560
a guy who most of the time is just so bland and uninteresting that nobody really pays attention

13
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:15,040
to him and Jimmy Kimmel has used this tactic of being just bland enough to slowly wriggle his way

14
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:20,560
into the flesh of popular culture. I think most people just assume that because Jimmy Kimmel is

15
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:24,880
everywhere, then he must be some really talented and respected guy that everyone loves. It's like

16
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:29,440
the Emperor's New Clothes. Everyone just assumes Jimmy Kimmel is this really great guy and no one

17
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:34,480
really questions it. But when you dig a little bit deeper, you'll find that Jimmy Kimmel is actually a

18
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:40,640
very problematic individual. In fact, Jimmy Kimmel is emblematic of some very troubling issues in

19
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:45,760
American society as a whole. And before I jump into why, it's important to recognize that when I talk

20
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:50,880
about Jimmy Kimmel, I'm talking about the persona he portrays on television. I don't know the guy,

21
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:56,960
maybe he's a really good dude off screen. But on screen, Jimmy Kimmel is a cultural tumor and I

22
00:01:56,960 --> 00:02:03,280
don't think anybody realizes just how bad he is. This is the definitive Jimmy Kimmel rant.

23
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:30,640
So let's start with the obvious here. Jimmy Kimmel is supposedly a comedian, yet his show isn't really

24
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:35,760
that funny. And yeah, yeah, I get that humorous objective and whatever, but Jimmy Kimmel is one of

25
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:41,760
the least funny comedians I have ever seen. And a lot of people would probably agree with me on this.

26
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:47,280
Let me put it to you this way. Watching Jimmy Kimmel is like watching a try to laugh challenge.

27
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:53,360
It's actually somewhat fascinating how unfunny this show is. Winter Storm Quinn as the Weather

28
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:57,920
Channel, uh, or Winter Storm, Winter Storm Quinoa as the Food Network is calling it.

29
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:04,800
You can be funny by either constructing clever and well thought out jokes or by making a joke so

30
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:10,480
unfunny that it is funny. When Jimmy Kimmel structures his comedy, he somehow fails to land

31
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:16,560
on either end of the spectrum. His humor is so bland and tepid that it's actually somewhat sad.

32
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:21,440
It's like watching a middle-aged school teacher trying his hardest to appear funny to the students

33
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:25,200
even though he's completely out of touch. You almost want to throw in a pity chuckle,

34
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:30,400
but Kimmel delivers his jokes in such a smug and cocky way that you can't feel sorry for him.

35
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:35,360
He just ends up floundering on stage as you wait for him to shut up and interview a celebrity.

36
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:40,320
It's pretty ironic how the least entertaining part of Jimmy Kimmel Live is Jimmy Kimmel,

37
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:44,960
but that's nothing. I wish Jimmy Kimmel only stuck to unfunny jokes because the other stuff

38
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:53,600
on the show is even more problematic. So if you've ever watched any clip from Jimmy Kimmel,

39
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:58,720
it's probably been one of the show's side segments like mean tweets or street interviews.

40
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:04,960
Katy Perry has a voice that reminds me of balls covered in glass sliding down my throat.

41
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:08,320
They ask you how you are, you just have to say that you're fine. You're not really fine,

42
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:12,400
but you just can't get into it. And as far as I can tell, these segments are really hit or miss.

43
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:16,240
The two segments I happened to watch on TV the other day were pretty atrocious.

44
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:19,040
One of them was literally just making fun of a guy's foreign accent.

45
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:34,400
And the other was some of the most uncomfortable five minutes of television I've ever seen.

46
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:38,640
I hate to use the word cringe, but that's honestly all I felt when watching this segment.

47
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:42,400
I genuinely feel sorry for the two families who participated in this.

48
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:05,840
But regardless of the quality of these segments, you have to realize that they all profit off of

49
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:10,320
other people's content. Jimmy Kimmel takes advantage of powerless individuals to fill

50
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:15,040
content on his show. He's essentially doing the same thing as YouTube compilation and reaction

51
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:19,840
channels. Basically Jimmy Kimmel knows he's not entertaining enough to carry the show on his own,

52
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:25,200
so he supplements his programming with other people's ideas. He takes trendy ideas from the

53
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:29,840
internet and fools the public into thinking he came up with them on his own. He just plasters

54
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:35,680
his face and logo over real entertaining content and funnels all the credit to himself. We rip

55
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:41,200
apart YouTubers like SoFloAntonio for doing the same thing, yet Jimbo has been doing this stuff

56
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:46,880
all along on national television. I won't lie, this is definitely me when I'm driving.

57
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:48,480
...and several other traffic violations...

58
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,560
That's not a hit and run, that's a run and hit is what it is.

59
00:05:56,320 --> 00:06:02,000
Funny jokes. It's just lazy and it sets a poor precedent for entertainment as a whole.

60
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:06,480
Why work hard to write creative and original content when you can just repost ideas and

61
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:12,400
entertain your audience regardless? But whatever. So what if Jimmy Kimmel profits off of unoriginal

62
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:17,760
and unfunny content? These things are somewhat forgivable. It's a network TV show, this kind

63
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:23,440
of stuff happens all over the place. So what's the big deal? And if Jimmy Kimmel only did these two

64
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:29,520
things, then I wouldn't be making this video. But no, old Jimbo is not satisfied with just being

65
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:35,840
unoriginal and unfunny. No no no, he has to actively try and warp society as he does it,

66
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:41,200
and that's where I draw the line. Now it's my problem.

67
00:06:41,200 --> 00:07:01,120
So let's talk about politics. Jimmy Kimmel likes to talk about politics. Actually,

68
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:04,400
politics is a bit of a stretch. Jimmy Kimmel likes to talk about...

69
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:18,880
Donald Trump. Are you aware that Donald Trump is the President of the United States?

70
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:23,280
No, but seriously, this guy never shuts up about Donald Trump. And this is not really

71
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:27,600
all Jimmy Kimmel's fault. It's part of a larger trend that I like to call the Colbert Effect.

72
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:33,520
So here's a bit of background. In 2014, longtime late night TV host David Letterman retired,

73
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:38,560
and CBS elected to replace him with Stephen Colbert, the former host of the Colbert Report

74
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:44,000
on Comedy Central. The Colbert Report was a politically charged parody of Fox News hosts,

75
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:48,640
and Colbert himself comes from the same school of thought as outspoken liberal comedian Jon

76
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:53,680
Stewart. So when Colbert took over the late show, he brought his political viewpoints to a more

77
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:59,360
mainstream audience. And by political viewpoints, I mean bashing Donald Trump for 40 minutes straight.

78
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:04,560
But truth be told, Trump bashing is a good way to attract viewers. After Trump embarrassed

79
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:09,680
the Democrats in the 2016 election, American liberals reacted like a swarm of hornets

80
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:15,040
defending their nest. These bitter and delusional liberals have developed such a raging vendetta

81
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:20,800
against Trump and the Republicans that they will stop at no end to viciously attack anything he

82
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:25,760
does. Because that totally worked in the 18 months before the election. But anyway, after Trump's

83
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:31,360
inauguration, Colbert's late show attracted these angry liberal viewers en masse, and it became the

84
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:36,400
highest viewed program in its category. He took over the position from Jimmy Fallon, host of the

85
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:42,160
Tonight Show, who chose to downplay Trump discussion in order to preserve the comedy of his program.

86
00:08:42,160 --> 00:08:47,920
Jimmy, this is working for other people. Maybe we should step into the anti-Trump lane and get in

87
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:51,600
on this. It's just not what I do. I think it'd be weird for me to start doing it now. I don't really

88
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:57,040
even, you know, care that much about politics. I've got to be honest, I love pop culture more than

89
00:08:57,040 --> 00:09:01,920
I love politics. Which is actually a pretty respectable decision, although he certainly paid

90
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:06,560
for it in the ratings. So we've already established that Jimmy Kimmel is unoriginal and he doesn't

91
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:11,280
really care about comedy. So he decided to steal the idea of Trump bashing and use it in his own

92
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:17,040
show to try to boost his own ratings. And my lord is it obnoxious. Trump, Trump, the President.

93
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:21,600
President. Donald Trump. Trump. President. Trump administration. Here's the problem.

94
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:26,800
You can talk about serious political issues or you can have innocent family scavenger hunts.

95
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:31,920
But you can't have them both. I'm sorry, but people don't tune into late night talk shows

96
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:38,000
after a hard day of work to get lectured about how bad America is. And even the ones who do

97
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:43,920
won't take you seriously because five minutes later you're Skyping a dabbing suburban family.

98
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:49,760
You've generated a completely unnecessary conflict of interest, but Jimmy Kimmel is so desperate for

99
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:55,280
viewership that he tries to play both lanes and he ends up turning politics into a joke and making

100
00:09:55,280 --> 00:10:00,480
his comedy less funny. Let's just look at this segment from the episode I watched. For those of

101
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:05,680
you who don't know, the U.S. and North Korea have been on bad terms since the Korean War

102
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:11,680
60 years ago. North Korea literally teaches anti-American propaganda in their schools,

103
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:15,840
which is admittedly not too different from the state of California. But seriously though,

104
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:21,040
North Korea is really, really despicable. North Korean people live in horrific conditions and get

105
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:26,640
executed when they try to leave the country. It's a brutal totalitarian dictatorship and it's

106
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:31,840
responsible for the biggest continuing human rights disaster in the world. When Donald Trump

107
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:36,560
took office, he took a no-nonsense approach to North Korea, openly mocking their leader

108
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:41,760
Kim Jong-un and threatening nuclear retaliation. And at the time, the media ripped Trump for

109
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:46,960
threatening nuclear war. But it actually might have worked because on March 8th, 2018,

110
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:52,560
the White House announced that Trump accepted an invitation to meet with Kim Jong-un. This is

111
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:58,720
huge news. This could potentially lead to peace with America's worst foreign adversary.

112
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:01,280
So let's see what Jimmy Kimmel has to say about this.

113
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:09,200
President Trump appreciated the briefing and said he would meet Kim Jong-un by May.

114
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:15,600
By May? He's not still going to be president by May. We need to get that.

115
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:23,520
Wow. Okay. So he completely takes the piss out of it and somehow manages to spin the story into

116
00:11:23,520 --> 00:11:30,160
anti-Trump rhetoric. This is just so stupid and counterproductive for society. And it's not just

117
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:35,040
Kimmel who does this. Like I said, it's most of these late night hosts, but it's as if these guys

118
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:39,840
are physically incapable of saying a single positive thing about Trump. And I don't even

119
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:44,800
like Trump and I disagree with a lot of his policies, but this anti-Trump bias in the media

120
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:50,560
has become laughably absurd. Trump could cure cancer and bring world peace in the same day,

121
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:54,880
and the American media would still find a way to spin it into a negative. Trump is here

122
00:11:54,880 --> 00:12:03,680
potentially making peace with North Korea and all Jimbo can say is, and then he expects to be taken

123
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:08,800
seriously as a political commentator. Also, I don't buy that he's just a comedian making fun

124
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:13,760
of topical events. Kimmel and these other late night hosts never went after Obama to the extent

125
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:18,960
they attacked Trump. And I don't care how much you don't like Trump. It's ethically irresponsible for

126
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:24,480
Kimmel and the rest of these talking heads to inject their political bias in American society.

127
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:30,240
The media has gone so berserk with this anti-Trump agenda that it's bordering on propaganda at this

128
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:35,920
point. I find it funny how a month ago the media was actually sympathizing with North Korea just

129
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:40,800
to spite Donald Trump. These people are so delusional in their belief that Trump is this

130
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:46,400
fascist incarnation of Hitler that they're willing to side with a literal fascist dictatorship just

131
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:57,920
to be contrarian to the president. Oh well anyway here's another segment mocking the president. Man

132
00:12:57,920 --> 00:13:02,320
isn't it messed up how Trump has done some sexually questionable things in the past?

133
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:06,240
Coming up next is an interview with former alleged rapist Kobe Bryant.

134
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:25,920
Bernie Sanders or Hillary Clinton?

135
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:35,360
What I do like about Bernie is that when he loses because the system is rigged against him totally

136
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:39,760
just like it was rigged against me I mean the system is rigged and if I didn't win by massive

137
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:45,200
landslides every state I would there was no chance that I could have won. But it's what started Amy's

138
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:56,240
downward spiral or upward spiral of her giant massive ego. So let's talk about celebrities.

139
00:13:56,240 --> 00:14:02,000
Americans are obsessed with them. There are people in this country who will literally saw off their

140
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:07,680
own limbs just for the opportunity to be spat on by their favorite celebrities. Celebrity culture

141
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:12,800
in America is toxic, parasocial, and I've always hated it. I understand that it's important to

142
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:17,600
appreciate and respect talented people but Americans tend to accentuate these principles

143
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:22,560
to the point of celebrity worship and when you place celebrities on these impossibly high

144
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:27,440
pedestals you start to forget that celebrities are just as flawed as the rest of us. And it's

145
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:32,480
talk shows like Jimmy Kimmel Live that really perpetuate America's celebrity obsession.

146
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:37,120
Celebrities and talk show hosts have a symbiotic relationship. The celebrity benefits by having

147
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:42,320
their book, movie, or album promoted to a national audience and the host benefits by leeching off the

148
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:48,000
celebrity's fame. Celebrity interviews have allowed relatively untalented people like Jimmy Kimmel to

149
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:52,720
become celebrities in their own right. Americans just see Kimmel on the same screen as their

150
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:58,080
favorite celebrities and they begin to associate him as equal status. It's simple Pavlovian

151
00:14:58,080 --> 00:15:01,920
conditioning. But I'm not here to complain about Jimmy Kimmel interviewing celebrities.

152
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:05,920
I understand that celebrity interviews are a routine part of every talk show.

153
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:10,720
I'm just pointing out that it's a bit hypocritical of Jimmy Kimmel to lampoon Trump's sexually

154
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:15,840
questionable past and then 10 minutes later have a pleasant chat with Kobe Bryant. I mean come on,

155
00:15:15,840 --> 00:15:22,320
the guy spent a year in a rape trial in 2003 and to do this during a time when all of Hollywood is

156
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:28,080
tainted with allegations of sexual misconduct it just reeks of a double standard. And you can see

157
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:33,280
this double standard on full display during Jimmy Kimmel's recent monologue at the Oscars.

158
00:15:33,280 --> 00:15:37,840
Watch how he downplays Hollywood's sexual misconduct by labeling it as a men's issue

159
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:42,160
rather than a Hollywood issue. But what happened with Harvey and what's happening all over was

160
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:47,040
long overdue. We can't let bad behavior slide anymore. The world is watching us. We need to

161
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:51,920
set an example and the truth is if we are successful here if we can work together to

162
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:57,360
stop sexual harassment in the workplace if we can do that women will only have to deal with

163
00:15:57,360 --> 00:16:03,840
harassment all the time at every other place they go. Wow. And this is just such a scummy thing to

164
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:10,400
say. No Jimmy the rest of society doesn't sexually harass women. How dare you condescend and slander

165
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:15,040
the rest of us for something we don't even do. I've never sexually assaulted a woman. I don't

166
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:19,520
associate with anyone who's ever sexually assaulted a woman. The vast majority of men

167
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:25,200
in society have never sexually assaulted a woman. Men who do sexually assault women get promptly

168
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:30,320
punished and ostracized for it and the only men who sexually assault women and get away with it

169
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:35,600
are rich powerful men like the ones in your industry. But go ahead downplay all the sexual

170
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:41,440
abuse in Hollywood by spreading lies misinformation and irrational fear to the rest of society.

171
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:46,000
Kind of ironic how you're preaching to the rest of us to respect women Jimmy considering some of

172
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:50,960
your past work. Let me show you guys a little segment conducted by Jimmy Kimmel called Guess

173
00:16:50,960 --> 00:16:55,520
What's in My Pants. I'm just going to let the footage speak for itself. And you're allowed to

174
00:16:55,520 --> 00:17:02,720
feel around on the outside of the pants you'll have 10 seconds to then guess what is in my pants.

175
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:09,440
How old are you? 18. Okay good you're sure of that because Uncle Jimmy doesn't need to do time.

176
00:17:09,440 --> 00:17:15,920
Feel harder feel a little bit faster squeeze squeeze maybe it would be easier if you put

177
00:17:15,920 --> 00:17:25,040
your mouth on it. Yes oh my goodness. Women will only have to deal with harassment all the time

178
00:17:25,040 --> 00:17:31,760
at every other place they go. Wow that's pretty bad that's YouTube prank channel's level of bad.

179
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:37,520
And you're allowed to feel around on the outside of the pants you have 10 seconds to then guess

180
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:46,320
what is in my pants. Now I don't watch the Oscars. Most of the time the best film doesn't win

181
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:50,960
and the whole program is infested with celebrity fileting and social justice lecturing.

182
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:56,800
Jimmy Kimmel's Oscars were no exception. None other than President Trump called Get Out the best

183
00:17:56,800 --> 00:18:01,520
first three quarters of a movie this year. And I find it interesting that Jimmy Kimmel is so

184
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:06,160
progressive and cares so much about social justice you almost forget that it's coming

185
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:14,320
from the same guys who made this. Sometime at night Pablo look up in the sky and say.

186
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:19,280
What the hell going on up there? Do UFOs live on another planet?

187
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:27,760
Phone and home like E.T. Come on read on TV. This is blackface.

188
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:43,520
Wow okay so it turns out Jimmy Kimmel has done some pretty racially and sexually questionable

189
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:48,320
stuff in the past. Well at least he doesn't stand up there and pretend he's morally superior to the

190
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:58,480
rest of us. Right? Ask yourself this if Jimmy Kimmel is so unoriginal and unfunny then why

191
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:03,360
hasn't he been replaced? He's not as funny as Jimmy Fallon. His political commentary is far

192
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:08,480
worse than Colbert's so why does the network keep him around? Why is he given the privilege of

193
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:15,040
hosting the Oscars? What element gives Jimmy Kimmel any value at all? Well you see every now and then

194
00:19:15,040 --> 00:19:21,680
Jimmy Kimmel likes to get up on his little soapbox and give a big fat speech. We saw it last year

195
00:19:21,680 --> 00:19:26,880
after the Vegas shooting where Jimmy Kimmel gave a deep impassioned speech with tears in his eyes

196
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:33,200
about the horrendous tragedy which he monetized on YouTube. But yeah big boy Jimmy standing up

197
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:39,040
to the evil NRA and those evil Republicans who want people to die in mass shootings and people

198
00:19:39,040 --> 00:19:44,080
love these speeches. People call Jimmy Kimmel a hero for standing up and being the self-appointed

199
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:49,120
moral compass of America. Well I'm here to say that's all a bunch of bullshit. Jimmy Kimmel is

200
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:54,320
just manipulating people's emotions after a tragedy and misleading the public just to inflate

201
00:19:54,320 --> 00:20:00,560
his ego and push his political agenda. Gun violence in America is an incredibly complex

202
00:20:00,560 --> 00:20:06,320
issue with no definite solution yet people like Jimmy Kimmel use every single mass shooting as

203
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:11,520
a vehicle to ram the gun control arguments down our throats. Now I want to make this perfectly

204
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:17,600
clear I don't like guns and I don't like the NRA but this notion that banning guns will magically

205
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:22,560
stop gun violence in America is completely ridiculous and every one of these talking heads

206
00:20:22,560 --> 00:20:26,720
like Jimmy Kimmel pushed this point that all these tragedies could have been prevented if there were

207
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:32,240
just a few more gun laws in place. That's the basis of their entire argument and it completely

208
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:37,760
oversimplifies the issue into oblivion while shutting down genuine discussion. Jimmy Kimmel

209
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:42,800
fools people into thinking that solving gun crime is as easy as banning assault rifles and they

210
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:48,400
think you support mass shootings if you disagree with that. Because it's too soon well maybe it's

211
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:54,480
too soon for you because deep down inside you know in your heart you know you bear some responsibility

212
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:58,880
for the fact that almost anyone can get any weapon they want now you want to cover yourself

213
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:03,840
until the storm of outrage passes you can go back to your dirty business as usual. Never mind the

214
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:08,640
fact that the vast vast majority of gun violence in America is carried out with handguns in the

215
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:14,400
inner cities banning guns is common sense and if you disagree you're basically a child murderer.

216
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:19,280
It's completely reductive reasoning that does nothing to help the problem and people like Jimmy

217
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:25,760
Kimmel do this with every political issue. Oh fixing education is so simple just throw more

218
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:30,480
money at it it doesn't matter that the U.S. has tripled their education spending since the 70s

219
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:35,520
and test scores haven't improved if you disagree then you must hate teachers and children and the

220
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:40,240
republicans do it too. Oh what's that you don't think we should spend 50 quintillion dollars on

221
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:45,280
the military? I guess you want America to be weak and defenseless. When you oversimplify an issue

222
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:50,880
to that extent you end up misleading society and derailing the discussion away from real solutions

223
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:55,760
and Jimmy Kimmel does this with every one of his little speeches and yeah I get that he has good

224
00:21:55,760 --> 00:22:00,880
intentions and all but Jimmy Kimmel is an entertainer he doesn't know a thing about politics

225
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:06,160
yet people listen to him as if he's some kind of expert he sure thinks he's an expert earlier this

226
00:22:06,160 --> 00:22:11,840
year he said you gotta be smart to be a liberal he really played the to be fair you have to have a

227
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:17,600
very high IQ to be liberal card man you know for a party of such brilliant people you guys sure do

228
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:23,360
lose a lot but that can't possibly be because of your own flaws no it's the fault of those dumb

229
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:28,640
evil racist republican voters I'm sure this year's oscars had the lowest viewership of all time

230
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:33,600
because anyone who didn't watch it hates women and minorities and supports shooting children

231
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:39,360
I'm so sick of these smug liberal hollywood millionaires who think they know what's best

232
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:43,840
for America do you ever think people get tired of listening to you insult the president every

233
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:49,440
five seconds do you think innocent people enjoy getting called racist sexist child murderers just

234
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:53,520
because they disagree with you because it's not like the vast majority of conservatives vote

235
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:59,760
republican because they want to pay lower taxes or anything nope they're racist bigots all of them

236
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:04,240
we should know since we're such intelligent liberals and all these rich hollywood liberals

237
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:08,400
like Jimmy Kimmel think they're such heroes for pretending that race relations are still a serious

238
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:13,200
problem in America you want to be a hero Jimmy how about you use one of your speeches to talk

239
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:17,760
about real issues maybe talk about the massive health crisis in America that's just been

240
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:22,880
happening under our noses maybe talk about how one out of every three Americans is fatter than

241
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:27,600
the michelin man maybe talk about solutions to a broken public school system that doesn't involve

242
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:32,240
just throwing more money at it because I don't see why it's still necessary to force kids to

243
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:37,440
waste six hours a day five days a week 180 days a year to sit in a place they don't want to be

244
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:42,480
when the internet exists maybe talk about how America's flawed infrastructure and urban design

245
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:47,440
has directly disadvantaged the working class maybe talk about how huge corporations practically

246
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:52,560
manipulate American lawmaking to maximize their profits by as much as possible maybe talk about

247
00:23:52,560 --> 00:23:57,440
how the war on drugs has turned millions of regular recreational drug users into dangerous

248
00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:02,080
hardened criminals maybe talk about the military industrial complex and why we're still fighting a

249
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:07,920
war on terror 17 years after 9 11 maybe instead of vaguely preaching at people to stop global

250
00:24:07,920 --> 00:24:14,240
warming you offer some actual solutions talk about the disastrous ecological impact of factory farming

251
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:19,120
encourage people to go vegan hell you could have talked about the rampant sexual misconduct in

252
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:24,160
your industry happening during your entire tenure before it became a public affair you could have

253
00:24:24,160 --> 00:24:29,040
talked about all of these real problems in America but you don't because I guess it's just easier to

254
00:24:29,040 --> 00:24:34,480
pretend that America is this bigoted hellhole and to get called heroic and brave for standing up to

255
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:40,480
a fake problem that you made up you keep perpetuating this nebulous agenda of racial and social

256
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:45,680
justice as if the civil rights movement never happened I get that maybe one out of ten thousand

257
00:24:45,680 --> 00:24:50,960
people in America are still overtly racist but who gives a shit about them let them be racist

258
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:55,760
it's just an opinion how are we going to get rid of racism and stop talking about it

259
00:24:56,720 --> 00:25:02,480
stop punishing the rest of us just because a tiny sliver of people have bad opinions your divisive

260
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:08,240
rhetoric is turning Americans against each other for no reason and making society a worse place

261
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:13,280
Americans can't turn on late night talk shows anymore without being scolded for stuff they

262
00:25:13,280 --> 00:25:18,480
don't do and don't believe it's so ironic that most of these people who demonize the rich white

263
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:23,920
elite are themselves part of the rich white elite these people have surrounded themselves with a

264
00:25:23,920 --> 00:25:29,040
cocoon of yes-men who agree with all their stupid ideas while shutting out anyone who even

265
00:25:29,040 --> 00:25:34,400
questions their delusional agenda they have lost sight of America's real problems so they have to

266
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:39,680
invent all these dumb made-up problems like microaggressions and representation in movies

267
00:25:39,680 --> 00:25:44,960
it's like they're so out of touch with real people thanks to their inbreeding of ideas

268
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:50,080
that they have no clue what's actually going on in America doesn't it bother you guys that you don't

269
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:52,560
bother you guys that you don't know anything

270
00:25:57,040 --> 00:26:01,200
weren't you a friend of hill like a good friend of hillary clinton's at one point

271
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:08,160
now i know you you're very very down on her what happened i had some i had some disagreement

272
00:26:08,160 --> 00:26:14,160
with her foreign policy i see with her foreign policy dan's character is not did you did you

273
00:26:14,160 --> 00:26:20,000
agree with her foreign policy listen never mind her foreign policy how about captain wacko we

274
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:27,760
got running the country here i mean foreign policy i'm shocked because i know you're you

275
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:33,520
were a very liberal socially liberal person in general i mean i'm still the same you all

276
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:38,160
moved we did you all went so far out you lost him

277
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:46,320
a lot of us you know no matter who we voted for we don't want to see our president fail

278
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:54,720
just chill just chill you know try to think positive for like why people wanted to change

279
00:26:55,680 --> 00:27:03,920
and it's up to the people here's my two cents damn it okay it's up to us to make this government work

280
00:27:03,920 --> 00:27:10,800
no matter who's president it's up to us to do our jobs as citizens and if we don't like something

281
00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:15,760
you know let them know you don't like it and then you got another election in two years

282
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:21,680
get out there and bow you listen you're expressing your views as crazy as they may be

283
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:35,440
so why did i make this video all you ever do is complain why do i even care what jimmy kimmel

284
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:41,680
says or does well can i just say this real quick have you noticed that liberals have gone completely

285
00:27:41,680 --> 00:27:47,360
insane and it's not all of them but it's certainly more than a healthy amount for society i mean

286
00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:52,640
just look at what some of these people are doing and saying these people are clinically insane

287
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:57,200
and there's a ton of them you want to know why liberals keep losing in america

288
00:27:57,200 --> 00:28:02,320
maybe it's because a big chunk of your party has gone off the deep end you liberals are so

289
00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:08,000
confused as to why people are choosing republicans over you when the answer is so simple all you have

290
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:13,600
to do to beat the republicans is be the less ignorant party all you have to do is be more

291
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:20,160
rational than info wars people and you have somehow failed to do that it's a complete joke

292
00:28:20,160 --> 00:28:25,200
and don't assume i'm making this video just to bash liberals personally i think society functions

293
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:30,160
a lot better when liberals don't act completely insane and there was a time not too long ago when

294
00:28:30,160 --> 00:28:34,800
liberals were the far more rational party that was back when they actually cared about helping

295
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:41,120
disadvantaged people and in just a decade or so you liberals have somehow taken that simple idea

296
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:46,000
and corrupted it into bullying anyone who disagrees with you by calling them racist

297
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:52,800
nowadays rather than helping the poor or the sick it's all about helping the blacks and the gays

298
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:59,280
liberals don't treat people like people anymore it's all about dividing up everyone by their skin

299
00:28:59,280 --> 00:29:04,320
color gender and sexuality the very same principles that real liberals fought against in

300
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:09,280
the 60s many of today's liberals will tell you that there's no such thing as a poor white person

301
00:29:09,280 --> 00:29:14,160
because they genuinely believe that the color of your skin somehow makes you privileged

302
00:29:14,160 --> 00:29:20,000
this toxic belief system is destroying western civilization and it's seeping into some of the

303
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:25,520
most powerful institutions of society some of these liberals certainly belong in an institution

304
00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:31,360
and that raises the question what went wrong how did these liberals become so delusional well i

305
00:29:31,360 --> 00:29:37,120
think the answer to that can be found every weeknight on abc at 11 35 you're what's wrong

306
00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:42,560
with america get off the stage you have guys like jimmy kimmel who have this huge platform

307
00:29:42,560 --> 00:29:48,800
and a ton of influence espousing their uninformed political opinions and americans just buy into it

308
00:29:48,800 --> 00:29:53,840
these guys get all riled up and emotional and say a bunch of stuff that sounds good in the moment

309
00:29:53,840 --> 00:29:58,800
and people fall for those ideas without even thinking jimmy kimmel's rise to prominence is

310
00:29:58,800 --> 00:30:04,480
a cautionary tale of trust and loyalty for some reason many americans trust celebrities and

311
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:09,680
entertainers so much that they're willing to blindly accept any of their opinions as true

312
00:30:09,680 --> 00:30:15,200
because here in america we love our celebrities and how can a celebrity be wrong about anything

313
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:19,760
but it's important to remember that hollywood is a place where some of the most talented people in

314
00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:25,600
the world come together to produce great works of fiction but fiction isn't real and when you

315
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:30,400
surround yourself with nothing but fiction don't be surprised when you start to lose touch with

316
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:35,280
reality so i guess the lesson of today's video is jimmy kimmel is a talentless hack and he's

317
00:30:35,280 --> 00:30:40,320
polluting the public agenda with dumb ideas so do yourself a favor and stop getting your political

318
00:30:40,320 --> 00:30:45,520
and moral guidance from a guy who performed in blackface on national television oh but then again

319
00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:50,000
what do i know i'm just a guy who complains about memes memes are dumb and stupid i have no idea

320
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:56,720
what i'm talking about i'm sure uh-oh looks like emp lemon is back on the downward spiral again

321
00:30:56,720 --> 00:31:02,800
tune in next month when emp complains about something else emperor lemon's never-ending

322
00:31:02,800 --> 00:31:09,840

me back at the beginning it put me back to the bottom it just resets itself there's no way to

326
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:38,640
