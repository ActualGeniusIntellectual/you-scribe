0	5000	Brought to you by Raycon Earbuds. Stay tuned for more information.
9000	12500	This is a follow-up to my video Operation Red Herring.
12500	16500	If you haven't seen it yet, I highly recommend watching it first for context.
16500	22500	So since I uploaded this video, there have been several new developments related to the Matt Watson controversy,
22500	25000	and I just wanted to briefly cover them here.
25000	29000	The first finding actually came within a few days of me posting the video,
29000	32000	and was remarkably hiding in plain sight.
32000	36000	It turns out that when Matt was streaming his list of targeted advertisers,
36000	41000	the document contained this username and password just pasted right out in the open.
41000	48000	Well, an anonymous fan noticed this and entered the login information to the email site, and it actually worked.
48000	55000	I kid you not. Matt Watson just conspicuously left his email information out in the open for anyone to see.
55000	64000	Now, this is not Matt's personal email, rather an anonymous burner email he used for the specific purpose of sending the YouTube wake-up report to news outlets.
64000	69000	I have emailed several news outlets, BuzzFeed and stuff like that.
69000	75000	And then I made evidence that I collected in a separate video that I have sent off to BuzzFeed.
75000	79000	I sent it to BBC. I sent it to local news in my area.
79000	83000	In the original video, it wasn't clear what he meant by this.
83000	89000	But with this new information, we can see the mysterious report and also the exact news outlets he sent it to.
92000	99000	So at around 4 p.m. on February 17, 2019, roughly six hours before posting his YouTube video,
99000	103000	Matt emailed a report to various Canadian news outlets and BuzzFeed.
103000	111000	What's interesting here is that the initial news coverage about the controversy seemed to have been published completely independently of Matt's anonymous report.
111000	116000	Pretty much all the outlets Matt contacted directly appeared to have ignored the story.
116000	125000	Most coverage of the controversy came from American publications, practically all of which only cited Matt's YouTube video and not the burner email.
125000	130000	The content of the message is similar to what he posted in the description of the YouTube wake-up video,
130000	136000	but attached to the email was a link to a OneDrive folder with all of Matt's supposed evidence.
136000	144000	Well, our anonymous correspondent attempted to recover the files, and lo and behold, they were still there, completely intact.
144000	151000	The drive consists of two partitions, one of which is a video commentary of Matt scrolling through the comment sections on children's videos.
151000	157000	This is very similar to the video he posted on YouTube where he tries to prove the existence of the wormhole,
157000	160000	with the only real difference being that he uses a voice-changing filter.
160000	166000	So you can see there, I've already found my way into this wormhole, and actually you can see right here,
166000	171000	there was some advertising there that I didn't even actually register when I was making the video.
171000	174000	Hey dummy, I'm gonna call you Darth Matt from now on.
174000	180000	The other part of the drive is a folder consisting of all the brands Matt could find advertising on child videos.
180000	186000	Now, funnily enough, Matt actually commentates one of these clips and forgets to put on the voice filter,
186000	190000	which raises the question of why he even bothered in the first place.
190000	195000	What's Purine advertising on? Oh, dear.
195000	200000	But then again, this is the same guy who live-streamed his email password for the whole world to see,
200000	204000	so we aren't exactly dealing with the most competent individual.
204000	213000	What's actually notable here is that the supposedly damning evidence that Matt used to initiate a large-scale ad boycott on YouTube is quite underwhelming.
213000	218000	First of all, pretty much all of these examples were gathered from foreign language videos.
218000	226000	While it's certainly not ideal that this content exists, it's at least understandable that YouTube, a US-based company,
226000	230000	would have a harder time enforcing its policies in international markets.
230000	237000	YouTube simply does not have the resources to patrol foreign language content as much as they do English-speaking content.
237000	246000	A YouTuber in Russia can just get away with more stuff than a YouTuber in the US because YouTube has fewer employees available to monitor Russian-language content.
246000	256000	While it's unfortunate that this can create blind spots for abuse, it is certainly not evidence of an elaborate wormhole in which YouTube is facilitating child exploitation.
256000	262000	But enough about that. Let's set our sights on the actual meat of this evidence, the brands.
263000	272000	Matt's entire campaign was predicated on the idea that companies are running ads on videos with predators lurking in the comment sections.
272000	276000	So based on that, do you notice anything wrong with this picture?
276000	284000	Hmm, I don't know. Could it possibly be that the wormhole isn't even here because the comments have already been disabled?
284000	287000	How about this one? Comments disabled here, too.
287000	295000	In fact, on at least a third of these examples Matt posted, the brand in question ran ads on a video with disabled comments.
295000	305000	This was a pretty significant detail to leave out of the overall expose because it kind of undermines his entire point about how YouTube was doing nothing about the problem.
305000	311000	According to Matt's logic, a mass ad boycott was necessary to force YouTube to take action.
311000	320000	And yet his own evidence proves that YouTube was already working on the issue, thus rendering the entire boycott completely pointless.
326000	338000	And just as I suspected, Matt's compilation of brands also provides evidence that plenty of the child videos only had ads because of automated content ID claims from third-party music companies.
338000	345000	It's no wonder why Matt didn't publicize any of this specific evidence because it would have made his agenda look even more flimsy.
353000	360000	And before I move on from this, I just wanted to put the final nail in the coffin of this completely preposterous ad boycott theory.
360000	365000	This is something that I wanted to discuss in my original video, but I had to cut it for time reasons.
366000	374000	YouTube ads, along with basically any ad on the internet, are entirely dependent on the user and not the content.
374000	382000	A Coca-Cola ad in front of a PewDiePie video probably means that AdWords knows that the viewer drinks soda.
382000	388000	It doesn't mean that Coca-Cola is sponsoring PewDiePie or PewDiePie is a spokesperson for Coca-Cola.
389000	395000	The content of the content is completely irrelevant. This is how ads are placed online.
395000	409000	The ads that are run with it cannot in any way be interpreted to be an endorsement of what that video says, which is an argument that you used to be able to make with TV because there everything was planned.
409000	415000	This is the reason why when Matt goes to click on a Russian video, he doesn't get Russian ads.
415000	420000	The brands he saw would have showed up on literally any monetized video he clicked on.
420000	425000	The fact that these specific examples appeared on sketchy child videos is arbitrary.
425000	437000	You could have zero subscribers and upload a video of yourself eating dog poo off the sidewalk, slap a Drake song on there, and YouTube will run ads on the content because that's just how the revenue claim system works.
437000	444000	If you don't like it, then blame the music companies, but don't blame YouTube and don't blame the companies running the ads.
444000	455000	Trying to argue that brands in any way endorse the YouTube videos they appear on is equivalent to me saying that you endorse UPS because they just happened to deliver you whatever package you ordered this week.
455000	460000	YouTube videos are simply the means of transporting ads to the consumer and nothing more.
460000	463000	So in conclusion, shut up about ad boycotts.
463000	472000	Anybody who tries to justify targeting brands on YouTube has no idea how YouTube ads work and should probably go back to watching television.
472000	477000	So that's basically all you need to know about Matt self leaking his emails besides one more thing.
477000	482000	One of the messages in his inbox was a confirmation email for a new Reddit account.
482000	488000	And when you go to look up the account on Reddit, it's only posts or comments on the YouTube wake up subreddit.
489000	495000	So we now have undeniable proof of Matt posing as a regular user to manipulate public opinion in his favor.
495000	501000	Now that we know this is true, one has to wonder just how contrived this so-called movement really is.
501000	504000	How many of these accounts are just Matt in disguise?
504000	510000	To what extent did Matt exploit alternate accounts to give his post traction in the first place?
510000	516000	If at this point you still believe that YouTube wake up was an organic campaign committed solely in good faith,
516000	522000	then you'd have to explain why Matt found it necessary to back himself up with fabricated shell accounts.
522000	527000	It seems that the more information you uncover about Matt Watson, the more two-faced he becomes.
527000	533000	So much so that it's practically impossible to tell which version of Matt is the real Matt.
533000	540000	One of the prevailing mysteries from the original video was the lack of any substantial information regarding Matt's real life identity.
540000	547000	However, about a week after I posted the video, I received a new tip that brings us one step closer to figuring out who Matt really is.
547000	552000	A viewer of mine said that they recognized the landmarks from the videos on Matt's second channel,
552000	558000	and confirmed that he is, or at least was, operating out of Victoria, British Columbia, Canada.
558000	563000	Cross-referencing this with Google Street View imagery confirms that this is true.
563000	568000	Attached to this post was a link to a YouTube video from October of 2017.
568000	571000	And ladies and gentlemen, there he is.
575000	580000	The uploader even links to his known Instagram confirming that this is the real Matt.
580000	589000	So it appears that in 2017, Matt worked briefly as an assistant for a man by the name of Timothy West, a wedding photographer in Victoria.
589000	597000	The extent of their relationship is unknown, as this is the only incidence I could find of Matt appearing on Mr. West's YouTube channel or website.
597000	603000	However, at the very least, we have a concrete example of Matt Watson existing in the real world.
603000	608000	I tried to reach out to Mr. West for more information and received no response.
608000	614000	Unfortunately, the only person we know who has any connection with Matt appears to be yet another dead end.
614000	617000	And that was the end of the story for about a month.
617000	620000	And then something happened which I honestly did not expect.
620000	623000	Matt Watson returned to the internet.
624000	629000	On April 20, 2020, Matt posted online for the first time in nine months.
629000	636000	He published an update to both his Reddit account and YouTube community tab in which he addressed the YouTube Wake Up campaign in hindsight.
636000	642000	Remarkably for what seemed like the first time ever, Matt actually expressed regret for some of his actions.
642000	648000	He even mentioned watching and agreeing with the right opinions video about the controversy.
648000	654000	Matt tried to justify his recklessness by claiming he wasn't expecting the campaign to become as big as it did.
654000	660000	This is a pretty lame excuse given the great lengths Matt went to exacerbate the controversy as much as he could.
660000	664000	So you can find all this information. Guys, please contact them.
664000	673000	It's kind of like dropping a brick off an overpass and feeling sorry for causing a 10-car pileup because you weren't expecting it to do that much damage.
673000	679000	In the end, Matt claims that the whole purpose of the video was to spread awareness in media literacy.
679000	686000	Which is questionable considering how Matt spent most of his efforts pressuring advertisers to pull out of YouTube.
686000	695000	If he really was out to create awareness for the issue, he would have at least mentioned something like the cyber tip line at least once in his 15-plus hours of content.
695000	703000	But on the contrary, Matt mostly dissuaded people from actually reporting violations by treating an ad boycott as the only viable solution.
703000	706000	He was saying, I've reported these videos and they're still here.
706000	710000	As I said, I reported to YouTube many times what I was finding.
710000	713000	The report button does a lot more than he was leading people to believe.
713000	718000	That report goes into a priority queue where a human reviewer is going to look at it.
718000	722000	The content gets sent to the Center for Missing and Exploited Children.
722000	729000	So it could become crucial evidence in finding a missing child or prosecuting abuse.
729000	735000	I spent the week that Matt was contacting advertisers trying to tell his audience, guys, that report button actually does something.
735000	741000	Matt is spreading misinformation about the report button and it is very important that you report videos.
741000	745000	I was trying to report this to YouTube for an entire week as I was making videos.
745000	749000	I was trying to report this to YouTube for an entire week as I was making this video.
749000	752000	And YouTube didn't do anything about it.
752000	758000	The rest of the statement pretty much regurgitates much of the same information from his original farewell address.
758000	760000	So there's not much new to say there.
760000	763000	Oh, so some guy said, so let's get this real, dude.
763000	764000	I don't even know who the hell that is.
764000	766000	So are you kidding me?
766000	770000	Harassing some woman is worse.
771000	774000	So first of all, dude, I can't even deal with this.
776000	778000	But let's talk about the elephant in the room.
778000	780000	Did Matt watch my video?
780000	784000	Well, it's almost certain that my video provoked him to come out of hiding.
784000	789000	I see no other reason why Matt would just reappear one day completely unprompted.
789000	793000	Within a month of me uploading a high profile video directly challenging him.
793000	798000	Whether or not he actually watched the video is still up for interpretation.
798000	804000	A Reddit user asked Matt a series of questions based on my video and Matt surprisingly replied,
804000	809000	Buckle up everyone because this is the closest we're gonna get to Matt actually responding to my video.
812000	815000	The first question asked Matt what everyone is thinking.
815000	819000	Why he came back and whether or not he watched my video.
819000	823000	Matt once again praised the right opinions video for convincing him of his mistakes.
823000	827000	Yet he acted pretty dismissive of my video.
827000	834000	Matt is certainly aware that the video exists because of the numerous people commenting on his YouTube post calling him an industry shill.
834000	840000	But unfortunately this appears to have caused Matt to write off the video entirely as a conspiracy theory.
840000	847000	It's rather ironic because everything I said in that video was far more substantiated than anything Matt said in his.
847000	856000	So if you want to talk about conspiracies, maybe we should first talk about you spearheading an entire campaign claiming that YouTube and its creators are all complicit in a massive operation
856000	862000	to exploit children. I mean come on there's not much separating YouTube wake up from Pizzagate.
862000	867000	So Matt doesn't exactly have a leg to stand on for deriding others as conspiracy theorists.
867000	873000	It's also ironic how Matt praises the right opinions video about him for pointing out where he went wrong.
873000	878000	Even though my video essentially does the exact same thing and discusses many of the same points.
878000	886000	You know, it's almost like actually respecting your critics and listening to what they have to say can improve your overall understanding of the situation.
886000	890000	I don't know, what do you think the right opinion? Do you think Matt should give my video a chance?
890000	893000	From a personal perspective, yes.
893000	899000	Now Matt doesn't have any obligation to watch M Lemon's video, he might be a busy man, he might have personally moved on.
899000	907000	But a lot of the legacy that his actions precipitated are still felt today, and if he is interested in a fresh angle on the topic then I'd recommend it.
907000	914000	I think what has put Matt off is the fact that a lot of people immediately responded to his YouTube statement writing him off as an industry plant,
914000	917000	something mentioned in M Lemon's upload.
917000	924000	Now, although that idea is floated, an idea that I personally doubt, it is presented with reasonable acknowledgement that it is just a theory,
924000	930000	and it is proposed with relative mind to other hypotheses surrounding Matt's actions and with corresponding evidence.
930000	934000	What I'm saying is that I wouldn't dismiss M Lemon's video on that basis.
934000	942000	It's not a video that I fully agreed with, but if you want an upload that posits some good theory and asks some really interesting questions, then there's no better place to start.
942000	949000	I'll kick you in the nuts and you'll smile at me and like it, and show me some respect!
949000	954000	The second question asks Matt about his legacy as one of the most hated people in the history of YouTube.
954000	961000	Here, Matt basically backtracks on all of his regret from the original post and says that YouTube Wake Up was totally worth it,
962000	970000	despite being fundamentally flawed in its approach and how the same result could have easily been accomplished without forcing YouTubers to lose money.
970000	978000	The third question asked Matt why he thinks his video received so much notoriety despite numerous YouTubers covering the same issue previously.
978000	982000	Matt gives a non-answer that doesn't really tell us anything.
982000	988000	He also tried to weirdly downplay the severity of YouTube Wake Up as just standard petty online drama.
988000	989000	Really?
989000	997000	I don't know if my memory is failing me here, but I can't quite recall Belle Delphine or Alinity ever costing me ad revenue.
997000	1004000	I don't ever remember Jeffree Star pressuring multi-billion dollar brands to withdraw their funding from the entire site.
1004000	1013000	It's clear from this that Matt wants to protect his ego by pretending that he didn't massively disrupt the quality of life for every creator on YouTube.
1013000	1019000	Question four brings up Matt's lack of knowledge regarding YouTube's monetization system during the controversy.
1019000	1024000	And funnily enough, Matt straight up admits to being ignorant of how ads even work on YouTube,
1024000	1029000	despite his entire campaign being contingent on a supposed flaw in the ad system.
1029000	1035000	But come on, though, does anyone really know how YouTube's monetization system works?
1035000	1040000	I don't know, Matt. Maybe the tens of thousands of people who depend on YouTube for revenue.
1040000	1044000	People who probably know a lot more about YouTube's ad system than you,
1044000	1049000	and the same people you called greedy when they rightfully pointed out how your campaign made no sense.
1049000	1055000	But it's good to know that the whole time you were instigating your syncophants to go pressure advertisers out of YouTube,
1055000	1058000	you actually had no idea how anything worked.
1058000	1061000	I hate you, you know that? I really do.
1061000	1065000	Question five asks whether anyone in Matt's personal life recognized him from the video.
1065000	1067000	He said no one did.
1067000	1072000	Question six raises the issue of Matt's strange lack of interaction with the news media.
1072000	1077000	Matt claims that he did respond to a few outlets when they tried to interview him.
1077000	1080000	I don't know what these were, he doesn't provide any specific examples,
1080000	1084000	and none of the articles I saw ever published any sort of interview with Matt,
1084000	1087000	so I guess this point will forever remain disputed.
1087000	1090000	And that's pretty much all Matt had to say about the matter.
1090000	1094000	He has once again vanished and looks unlikely to ever return.
1094000	1097000	This is probably the last video I'll make about the subject,
1097000	1103000	because I don't expect Matt to ever give a satisfying explanation to what really happened with YouTube Wake Up.
1103000	1106000	Out of the three theories I presented in the original video,
1106000	1112000	I currently believe that the angry leftist theory is the most plausible based on the evidence we have now.
1112000	1116000	But at the end of the day, we still don't have a solid conclusion.
1116000	1120000	But what if YouTube Wake Up speaks less about Matt Watson and more about us?
1120000	1127000	In the time since I posted this video, we have seen enraged mobs starting to heavily influence events in the real world.
1127000	1131000	We have seen YouTubers targeting other YouTubers' sponsorships.
1131000	1137000	Maybe something like YouTube Wake Up was inevitable and Matt Watson was merely a glimpse into our future.
1137000	1143000	A society where everyone tries to tackle the world's problems even though they have no idea what they're doing.
1143000	1149000	So does that mean that, in a roundabout way, we are to blame for the adpocalypse?
1149000	1153000	Well no, this whole controversy is almost entirely Matt's fault.
1153000	1160000	Honestly, Matt Watson is one of the most insufferable clowns I've ever had the displeasure of encountering on this entire website.
1160000	1166000	And I truly believe the world would be better off if his router exploded and he never touched the internet again.
1166000	1171000	So in conclusion, Matt Watson and braindead Redditors can all suck me.
1171000	1188000	Oh dear, was that last line not advertiser friendly? Oh well that's a shame.
1188000	1192000	I'm sure no company could possibly want to sponsor me now.
1192000	1195000	This video is sponsored by Raycon Earbuds.
1195000	1200000	In the age of cowardly companies and frivolous ad boycotts, it's Raycon to the rescue.
1200000	1204000	Helping YouTubers like me earn money at Matt Watson's expense.
1204000	1210000	Do you suffer from a fat idiot ginger constantly yelling in your ear about some nonsensical wormhole?
1210000	1219000	Well thanks to the new Everyday E25s, you can drown out those incoherent ramblings with Raycon's compact noise-isolating design.
1219000	1223000	If you're low on funds because a bunch of Redditors sabotaged your income for the month,
1223000	1230000	have no fear because Raycon earbuds start at just half the price of other premium brands while still sounding just as good.
1230000	1235000	And hey, if you won't listen to me because I'm just a greedy YouTuber who should go work for Uber,
1235000	1240000	then maybe you'll listen to these real-life celebrities who also use Raycon.
1240000	1247000	The Everyday E25s are their best model yet, featuring more bass, seamless Bluetooth connection, and six hours of battery life.
