Brought to you by Raycon Earbuds. Stay tuned for more information.

2
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,500
This is a follow-up to my video Operation Red Herring.

3
00:00:12,500 --> 00:00:16,500
If you haven't seen it yet, I highly recommend watching it first for context.

4
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:22,500
So since I uploaded this video, there have been several new developments related to the Matt Watson controversy,

5
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:25,000
and I just wanted to briefly cover them here.

6
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:29,000
The first finding actually came within a few days of me posting the video,

7
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,000
and was remarkably hiding in plain sight.

8
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,000
It turns out that when Matt was streaming his list of targeted advertisers,

9
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:41,000
the document contained this username and password just pasted right out in the open.

10
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Well, an anonymous fan noticed this and entered the login information to the email site, and it actually worked.

11
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:55,000
I kid you not. Matt Watson just conspicuously left his email information out in the open for anyone to see.

12
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Now, this is not Matt's personal email, rather an anonymous burner email he used for the specific purpose of sending the YouTube wake-up report to news outlets.

13
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:09,000
I have emailed several news outlets, BuzzFeed and stuff like that.

14
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:15,000
And then I made evidence that I collected in a separate video that I have sent off to BuzzFeed.

15
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:19,000
I sent it to BBC. I sent it to local news in my area.

16
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:23,000
In the original video, it wasn't clear what he meant by this.

17
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:29,000
But with this new information, we can see the mysterious report and also the exact news outlets he sent it to.

18
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:39,000
So at around 4 p.m. on February 17, 2019, roughly six hours before posting his YouTube video,

19
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Matt emailed a report to various Canadian news outlets and BuzzFeed.

20
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:51,000
What's interesting here is that the initial news coverage about the controversy seemed to have been published completely independently of Matt's anonymous report.

21
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Pretty much all the outlets Matt contacted directly appeared to have ignored the story.

22
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Most coverage of the controversy came from American publications, practically all of which only cited Matt's YouTube video and not the burner email.

23
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:10,000
The content of the message is similar to what he posted in the description of the YouTube wake-up video,

24
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:16,000
but attached to the email was a link to a OneDrive folder with all of Matt's supposed evidence.

25
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Well, our anonymous correspondent attempted to recover the files, and lo and behold, they were still there, completely intact.

26
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:31,000
The drive consists of two partitions, one of which is a video commentary of Matt scrolling through the comment sections on children's videos.

27
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:37,000
This is very similar to the video he posted on YouTube where he tries to prove the existence of the wormhole,

28
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:40,000
with the only real difference being that he uses a voice-changing filter.

29
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:46,000
So you can see there, I've already found my way into this wormhole, and actually you can see right here,

30
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:51,000
there was some advertising there that I didn't even actually register when I was making the video.

31
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Hey dummy, I'm gonna call you Darth Matt from now on.

32
00:02:54,000 --> 00:03:00,000
The other part of the drive is a folder consisting of all the brands Matt could find advertising on child videos.

33
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Now, funnily enough, Matt actually commentates one of these clips and forgets to put on the voice filter,

34
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:10,000
which raises the question of why he even bothered in the first place.

35
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:15,000
What's Purine advertising on? Oh, dear.

36
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:20,000
But then again, this is the same guy who live-streamed his email password for the whole world to see,

37
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:24,000
so we aren't exactly dealing with the most competent individual.

38
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:33,000
What's actually notable here is that the supposedly damning evidence that Matt used to initiate a large-scale ad boycott on YouTube is quite underwhelming.

39
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:38,000
First of all, pretty much all of these examples were gathered from foreign language videos.

40
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:46,000
While it's certainly not ideal that this content exists, it's at least understandable that YouTube, a US-based company,

41
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:50,000
would have a harder time enforcing its policies in international markets.

42
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:57,000
YouTube simply does not have the resources to patrol foreign language content as much as they do English-speaking content.

43
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:06,000
A YouTuber in Russia can just get away with more stuff than a YouTuber in the US because YouTube has fewer employees available to monitor Russian-language content.

44
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:16,000
While it's unfortunate that this can create blind spots for abuse, it is certainly not evidence of an elaborate wormhole in which YouTube is facilitating child exploitation.

45
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:22,000
But enough about that. Let's set our sights on the actual meat of this evidence, the brands.

46
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Matt's entire campaign was predicated on the idea that companies are running ads on videos with predators lurking in the comment sections.

47
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:36,000
So based on that, do you notice anything wrong with this picture?

48
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Hmm, I don't know. Could it possibly be that the wormhole isn't even here because the comments have already been disabled?

49
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,000
How about this one? Comments disabled here, too.

50
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:55,000
In fact, on at least a third of these examples Matt posted, the brand in question ran ads on a video with disabled comments.

51
00:04:55,000 --> 00:05:05,000
This was a pretty significant detail to leave out of the overall expose because it kind of undermines his entire point about how YouTube was doing nothing about the problem.

52
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:11,000
According to Matt's logic, a mass ad boycott was necessary to force YouTube to take action.

53
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:20,000
And yet his own evidence proves that YouTube was already working on the issue, thus rendering the entire boycott completely pointless.

54
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:38,000
And just as I suspected, Matt's compilation of brands also provides evidence that plenty of the child videos only had ads because of automated content ID claims from third-party music companies.

55
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:45,000
It's no wonder why Matt didn't publicize any of this specific evidence because it would have made his agenda look even more flimsy.

56
00:05:53,000 --> 00:06:00,000
And before I move on from this, I just wanted to put the final nail in the coffin of this completely preposterous ad boycott theory.

57
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:05,000
This is something that I wanted to discuss in my original video, but I had to cut it for time reasons.

58
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:14,000
YouTube ads, along with basically any ad on the internet, are entirely dependent on the user and not the content.

59
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:22,000
A Coca-Cola ad in front of a PewDiePie video probably means that AdWords knows that the viewer drinks soda.

60
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:28,000
It doesn't mean that Coca-Cola is sponsoring PewDiePie or PewDiePie is a spokesperson for Coca-Cola.

61
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:35,000
The content of the content is completely irrelevant. This is how ads are placed online.

62
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:49,000
The ads that are run with it cannot in any way be interpreted to be an endorsement of what that video says, which is an argument that you used to be able to make with TV because there everything was planned.

63
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:55,000
This is the reason why when Matt goes to click on a Russian video, he doesn't get Russian ads.

64
00:06:55,000 --> 00:07:00,000
The brands he saw would have showed up on literally any monetized video he clicked on.

65
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:05,000
The fact that these specific examples appeared on sketchy child videos is arbitrary.

66
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:17,000
You could have zero subscribers and upload a video of yourself eating dog poo off the sidewalk, slap a Drake song on there, and YouTube will run ads on the content because that's just how the revenue claim system works.

67
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:24,000
If you don't like it, then blame the music companies, but don't blame YouTube and don't blame the companies running the ads.

68
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Trying to argue that brands in any way endorse the YouTube videos they appear on is equivalent to me saying that you endorse UPS because they just happened to deliver you whatever package you ordered this week.

69
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:40,000
YouTube videos are simply the means of transporting ads to the consumer and nothing more.

70
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:43,000
So in conclusion, shut up about ad boycotts.

71
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Anybody who tries to justify targeting brands on YouTube has no idea how YouTube ads work and should probably go back to watching television.

72
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:57,000
So that's basically all you need to know about Matt self leaking his emails besides one more thing.

73
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:02,000
One of the messages in his inbox was a confirmation email for a new Reddit account.

74
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:08,000
And when you go to look up the account on Reddit, it's only posts or comments on the YouTube wake up subreddit.

75
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:15,000
So we now have undeniable proof of Matt posing as a regular user to manipulate public opinion in his favor.

76
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Now that we know this is true, one has to wonder just how contrived this so-called movement really is.

77
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:24,000
How many of these accounts are just Matt in disguise?

78
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:30,000
To what extent did Matt exploit alternate accounts to give his post traction in the first place?

79
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:36,000
If at this point you still believe that YouTube wake up was an organic campaign committed solely in good faith,

80
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:42,000
then you'd have to explain why Matt found it necessary to back himself up with fabricated shell accounts.

81
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:47,000
It seems that the more information you uncover about Matt Watson, the more two-faced he becomes.

82
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:53,000
So much so that it's practically impossible to tell which version of Matt is the real Matt.

83
00:08:53,000 --> 00:09:00,000
One of the prevailing mysteries from the original video was the lack of any substantial information regarding Matt's real life identity.

84
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:07,000
However, about a week after I posted the video, I received a new tip that brings us one step closer to figuring out who Matt really is.

85
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:12,000
A viewer of mine said that they recognized the landmarks from the videos on Matt's second channel,

86
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:18,000
and confirmed that he is, or at least was, operating out of Victoria, British Columbia, Canada.

87
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:23,000
Cross-referencing this with Google Street View imagery confirms that this is true.

88
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Attached to this post was a link to a YouTube video from October of 2017.

89
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:31,000
And ladies and gentlemen, there he is.

90
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:40,000
The uploader even links to his known Instagram confirming that this is the real Matt.

91
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:49,000
So it appears that in 2017, Matt worked briefly as an assistant for a man by the name of Timothy West, a wedding photographer in Victoria.

92
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:57,000
The extent of their relationship is unknown, as this is the only incidence I could find of Matt appearing on Mr. West's YouTube channel or website.

93
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:03,000
However, at the very least, we have a concrete example of Matt Watson existing in the real world.

94
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:08,000
I tried to reach out to Mr. West for more information and received no response.

95
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:14,000
Unfortunately, the only person we know who has any connection with Matt appears to be yet another dead end.

96
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:17,000
And that was the end of the story for about a month.

97
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:20,000
And then something happened which I honestly did not expect.

98
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:23,000
Matt Watson returned to the internet.

99
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:29,000
On April 20, 2020, Matt posted online for the first time in nine months.

100
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:36,000
He published an update to both his Reddit account and YouTube community tab in which he addressed the YouTube Wake Up campaign in hindsight.

101
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:42,000
Remarkably for what seemed like the first time ever, Matt actually expressed regret for some of his actions.

102
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:48,000
He even mentioned watching and agreeing with the right opinions video about the controversy.

103
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:54,000
Matt tried to justify his recklessness by claiming he wasn't expecting the campaign to become as big as it did.

104
00:10:54,000 --> 00:11:00,000
This is a pretty lame excuse given the great lengths Matt went to exacerbate the controversy as much as he could.

105
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:04,000
So you can find all this information. Guys, please contact them.

106
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:13,000
It's kind of like dropping a brick off an overpass and feeling sorry for causing a 10-car pileup because you weren't expecting it to do that much damage.

107
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:19,000
In the end, Matt claims that the whole purpose of the video was to spread awareness in media literacy.

108
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:26,000
Which is questionable considering how Matt spent most of his efforts pressuring advertisers to pull out of YouTube.

109
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:35,000
If he really was out to create awareness for the issue, he would have at least mentioned something like the cyber tip line at least once in his 15-plus hours of content.

110
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:43,000
But on the contrary, Matt mostly dissuaded people from actually reporting violations by treating an ad boycott as the only viable solution.

111
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:46,000
He was saying, I've reported these videos and they're still here.

112
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:50,000
As I said, I reported to YouTube many times what I was finding.

113
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:53,000
The report button does a lot more than he was leading people to believe.

114
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:58,000
That report goes into a priority queue where a human reviewer is going to look at it.

115
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:02,000
The content gets sent to the Center for Missing and Exploited Children.

116
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:09,000
So it could become crucial evidence in finding a missing child or prosecuting abuse.

117
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:15,000
I spent the week that Matt was contacting advertisers trying to tell his audience, guys, that report button actually does something.

118
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:21,000
Matt is spreading misinformation about the report button and it is very important that you report videos.

119
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:25,000
I was trying to report this to YouTube for an entire week as I was making videos.

120
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:29,000
I was trying to report this to YouTube for an entire week as I was making this video.

121
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:32,000
And YouTube didn't do anything about it.

122
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:38,000
The rest of the statement pretty much regurgitates much of the same information from his original farewell address.

123
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
So there's not much new to say there.

124
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:43,000
Oh, so some guy said, so let's get this real, dude.

125
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,000
I don't even know who the hell that is.

126
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
So are you kidding me?

127
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:50,000
Harassing some woman is worse.

128
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:54,000
So first of all, dude, I can't even deal with this.

129
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
But let's talk about the elephant in the room.

130
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
Did Matt watch my video?

131
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:04,000
Well, it's almost certain that my video provoked him to come out of hiding.

132
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:09,000
I see no other reason why Matt would just reappear one day completely unprompted.

133
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:13,000
Within a month of me uploading a high profile video directly challenging him.

134
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:18,000
Whether or not he actually watched the video is still up for interpretation.

135
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:24,000
A Reddit user asked Matt a series of questions based on my video and Matt surprisingly replied,

136
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:29,000
Buckle up everyone because this is the closest we're gonna get to Matt actually responding to my video.

137
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:35,000
The first question asked Matt what everyone is thinking.

138
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:39,000
Why he came back and whether or not he watched my video.

139
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:43,000
Matt once again praised the right opinions video for convincing him of his mistakes.

140
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:47,000
Yet he acted pretty dismissive of my video.

141
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:54,000
Matt is certainly aware that the video exists because of the numerous people commenting on his YouTube post calling him an industry shill.

142
00:13:54,000 --> 00:14:00,000
But unfortunately this appears to have caused Matt to write off the video entirely as a conspiracy theory.

143
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:07,000
It's rather ironic because everything I said in that video was far more substantiated than anything Matt said in his.

144
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:16,000
So if you want to talk about conspiracies, maybe we should first talk about you spearheading an entire campaign claiming that YouTube and its creators are all complicit in a massive operation

145
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:22,000
to exploit children. I mean come on there's not much separating YouTube wake up from Pizzagate.

146
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:27,000
So Matt doesn't exactly have a leg to stand on for deriding others as conspiracy theorists.

147
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:33,000
It's also ironic how Matt praises the right opinions video about him for pointing out where he went wrong.

148
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:38,000
Even though my video essentially does the exact same thing and discusses many of the same points.

149
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:46,000
You know, it's almost like actually respecting your critics and listening to what they have to say can improve your overall understanding of the situation.

150
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:50,000
I don't know, what do you think the right opinion? Do you think Matt should give my video a chance?

151
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:53,000
From a personal perspective, yes.

152
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:59,000
Now Matt doesn't have any obligation to watch M Lemon's video, he might be a busy man, he might have personally moved on.

153
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:07,000
But a lot of the legacy that his actions precipitated are still felt today, and if he is interested in a fresh angle on the topic then I'd recommend it.

154
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:14,000
I think what has put Matt off is the fact that a lot of people immediately responded to his YouTube statement writing him off as an industry plant,

155
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:17,000
something mentioned in M Lemon's upload.

156
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:24,000
Now, although that idea is floated, an idea that I personally doubt, it is presented with reasonable acknowledgement that it is just a theory,

157
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:30,000
and it is proposed with relative mind to other hypotheses surrounding Matt's actions and with corresponding evidence.

158
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:34,000
What I'm saying is that I wouldn't dismiss M Lemon's video on that basis.

159
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:42,000
It's not a video that I fully agreed with, but if you want an upload that posits some good theory and asks some really interesting questions, then there's no better place to start.

160
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:49,000
I'll kick you in the nuts and you'll smile at me and like it, and show me some respect!

161
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:54,000
The second question asks Matt about his legacy as one of the most hated people in the history of YouTube.

162
00:15:54,000 --> 00:16:01,000
Here, Matt basically backtracks on all of his regret from the original post and says that YouTube Wake Up was totally worth it,

163
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:10,000
despite being fundamentally flawed in its approach and how the same result could have easily been accomplished without forcing YouTubers to lose money.

164
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:18,000
The third question asked Matt why he thinks his video received so much notoriety despite numerous YouTubers covering the same issue previously.

165
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:22,000
Matt gives a non-answer that doesn't really tell us anything.

166
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:28,000
He also tried to weirdly downplay the severity of YouTube Wake Up as just standard petty online drama.

167
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,000
Really?

168
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:37,000
I don't know if my memory is failing me here, but I can't quite recall Belle Delphine or Alinity ever costing me ad revenue.

169
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:44,000
I don't ever remember Jeffree Star pressuring multi-billion dollar brands to withdraw their funding from the entire site.

170
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:53,000
It's clear from this that Matt wants to protect his ego by pretending that he didn't massively disrupt the quality of life for every creator on YouTube.

171
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:59,000
Question four brings up Matt's lack of knowledge regarding YouTube's monetization system during the controversy.

172
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:04,000
And funnily enough, Matt straight up admits to being ignorant of how ads even work on YouTube,

173
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:09,000
despite his entire campaign being contingent on a supposed flaw in the ad system.

174
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:15,000
But come on, though, does anyone really know how YouTube's monetization system works?

175
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:20,000
I don't know, Matt. Maybe the tens of thousands of people who depend on YouTube for revenue.

176
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:24,000
People who probably know a lot more about YouTube's ad system than you,

177
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:29,000
and the same people you called greedy when they rightfully pointed out how your campaign made no sense.

178
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:35,000
But it's good to know that the whole time you were instigating your syncophants to go pressure advertisers out of YouTube,

179
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:38,000
you actually had no idea how anything worked.

180
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:41,000
I hate you, you know that? I really do.

181
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:45,000
Question five asks whether anyone in Matt's personal life recognized him from the video.

182
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,000
He said no one did.

183
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:52,000
Question six raises the issue of Matt's strange lack of interaction with the news media.

184
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:57,000
Matt claims that he did respond to a few outlets when they tried to interview him.

185
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:00,000
I don't know what these were, he doesn't provide any specific examples,

186
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:04,000
and none of the articles I saw ever published any sort of interview with Matt,

187
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:07,000
so I guess this point will forever remain disputed.

188
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:10,000
And that's pretty much all Matt had to say about the matter.

189
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:14,000
He has once again vanished and looks unlikely to ever return.

190
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:17,000
This is probably the last video I'll make about the subject,

191
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:23,000
because I don't expect Matt to ever give a satisfying explanation to what really happened with YouTube Wake Up.

192
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:26,000
Out of the three theories I presented in the original video,

193
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:32,000
I currently believe that the angry leftist theory is the most plausible based on the evidence we have now.

194
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:36,000
But at the end of the day, we still don't have a solid conclusion.

195
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:40,000
But what if YouTube Wake Up speaks less about Matt Watson and more about us?

196
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:47,000
In the time since I posted this video, we have seen enraged mobs starting to heavily influence events in the real world.

197
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:51,000
We have seen YouTubers targeting other YouTubers' sponsorships.

198
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:57,000
Maybe something like YouTube Wake Up was inevitable and Matt Watson was merely a glimpse into our future.

199
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:03,000
A society where everyone tries to tackle the world's problems even though they have no idea what they're doing.

200
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:09,000
So does that mean that, in a roundabout way, we are to blame for the adpocalypse?

201
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:13,000
Well no, this whole controversy is almost entirely Matt's fault.

202
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:20,000
Honestly, Matt Watson is one of the most insufferable clowns I've ever had the displeasure of encountering on this entire website.

203
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:26,000
And I truly believe the world would be better off if his router exploded and he never touched the internet again.

204
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:31,000
So in conclusion, Matt Watson and braindead Redditors can all suck me.

205
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:48,000
Oh dear, was that last line not advertiser friendly? Oh well that's a shame.

206
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:52,000
I'm sure no company could possibly want to sponsor me now.

207
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:55,000
This video is sponsored by Raycon Earbuds.

208
00:19:55,000 --> 00:20:00,000
In the age of cowardly companies and frivolous ad boycotts, it's Raycon to the rescue.

209
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:04,000
Helping YouTubers like me earn money at Matt Watson's expense.

210
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:10,000
Do you suffer from a fat idiot ginger constantly yelling in your ear about some nonsensical wormhole?

211
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:19,000
Well thanks to the new Everyday E25s, you can drown out those incoherent ramblings with Raycon's compact noise-isolating design.

212
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:23,000
If you're low on funds because a bunch of Redditors sabotaged your income for the month,

213
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:30,000
have no fear because Raycon earbuds start at just half the price of other premium brands while still sounding just as good.

214
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:35,000
And hey, if you won't listen to me because I'm just a greedy YouTuber who should go work for Uber,

215
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:40,000
then maybe you'll listen to these real-life celebrities who also use Raycon.

216
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:47,000
The Everyday E25s are their best model yet, featuring more bass, seamless Bluetooth connection, and six hours of battery life.

217
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:53,000
Maybe you could use those six hours to actually educate yourself about YouTube's monetization system,

218
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:57,000

Did somebody say erectile dysfunction?

221
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,000
He looks like he's constipated.

222
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:11,000
69 PS triple arm.

223
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:14,000
Erectile dysfunction is affecting my sass.

224
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,000
Hangman!

225
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:20,000
Boy, I really hope somebody got PS triple for that blunder.

226
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,000
60 million.

227
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,000
You got erectile dysfunction.

228
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,000
Oh, um, sure.

229
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:36,000
It's weird to say, but I want to make it look bad for myself.

230
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:39,000
Yeah, my guy, that's a child. Yeah, that's a child, huh?
