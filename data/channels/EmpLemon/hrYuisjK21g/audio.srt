Savage Patrick is the reincarnation of the Chicken SpongeBob meme,

3
00:00:11,800 --> 00:00:15,020
which I thought was far and away the worst meme of 2017.

4
00:00:15,020 --> 00:00:20,320
I will admit that the Savage Patrick source image is at least funnier and less annoying than Chicken SpongeBob.

5
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:23,440
But other than that, this meme pretty much falls flat on its face.

6
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:25,280
This type of meme is nothing new.

7
00:00:25,280 --> 00:00:29,480
It's the latest installment of relatable emotions portrayed by SpongeBob.

8
00:00:29,480 --> 00:00:31,560
All these memes suffer from the same issue.

9
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:34,680
They're more shallow than a tub of Burger King foot lettuce.

10
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:40,160
Savage Patrick is a meme so basic that you could replace it with a single emoji and it won't make a bit of difference.

11
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:44,280
This is a meme that only works as a one-off joke applied to a specific situation.

12
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:47,280
It's simply not built to be spammed into oblivion.

13
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:52,280
It's the same punchline every time, and just changing the wind-up doesn't make it funny.

14
00:00:52,280 --> 00:00:55,720
As a matter of fact, it makes it less funny each time you see it.

15
00:00:55,800 --> 00:01:01,800
It has no substance, no room for iteration, and it's not even the best picture of Patrick for the joke.

16
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:04,800
To me, that makes this meme dead in the water.
