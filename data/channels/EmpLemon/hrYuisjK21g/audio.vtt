Savage Patrick is the reincarnation of the Chicken SpongeBob meme,

00:11.800 --> 00:15.020
which I thought was far and away the worst meme of 2017.

00:15.020 --> 00:20.320
I will admit that the Savage Patrick source image is at least funnier and less annoying than Chicken SpongeBob.

00:20.320 --> 00:23.440
But other than that, this meme pretty much falls flat on its face.

00:23.440 --> 00:25.280
This type of meme is nothing new.

00:25.280 --> 00:29.480
It's the latest installment of relatable emotions portrayed by SpongeBob.

00:29.480 --> 00:31.560
All these memes suffer from the same issue.

00:31.560 --> 00:34.680
They're more shallow than a tub of Burger King foot lettuce.

00:34.680 --> 00:40.160
Savage Patrick is a meme so basic that you could replace it with a single emoji and it won't make a bit of difference.

00:40.160 --> 00:44.280
This is a meme that only works as a one-off joke applied to a specific situation.

00:44.280 --> 00:47.280
It's simply not built to be spammed into oblivion.

00:47.280 --> 00:52.280
It's the same punchline every time, and just changing the wind-up doesn't make it funny.

00:52.280 --> 00:55.720
As a matter of fact, it makes it less funny each time you see it.

00:55.800 --> 01:01.800
It has no substance, no room for iteration, and it's not even the best picture of Patrick for the joke.

01:01.800 --> 01:04.800
To me, that makes this meme dead in the water.
