8520	11800	Savage Patrick is the reincarnation of the Chicken SpongeBob meme,
11800	15020	which I thought was far and away the worst meme of 2017.
15020	20320	I will admit that the Savage Patrick source image is at least funnier and less annoying than Chicken SpongeBob.
20320	23440	But other than that, this meme pretty much falls flat on its face.
23440	25280	This type of meme is nothing new.
25280	29480	It's the latest installment of relatable emotions portrayed by SpongeBob.
29480	31560	All these memes suffer from the same issue.
31560	34680	They're more shallow than a tub of Burger King foot lettuce.
34680	40160	Savage Patrick is a meme so basic that you could replace it with a single emoji and it won't make a bit of difference.
40160	44280	This is a meme that only works as a one-off joke applied to a specific situation.
44280	47280	It's simply not built to be spammed into oblivion.
47280	52280	It's the same punchline every time, and just changing the wind-up doesn't make it funny.
52280	55720	As a matter of fact, it makes it less funny each time you see it.
55800	61800	It has no substance, no room for iteration, and it's not even the best picture of Patrick for the joke.
61800	64800	To me, that makes this meme dead in the water.
