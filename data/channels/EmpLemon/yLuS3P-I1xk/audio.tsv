0	12720	This meme kind of felt like the end of an era.
12720	17900	There was once a time when Shrek and Cringe Culture were apex contenders of dankness.
17900	20120	Now they're just like all the rest.
20120	24740	The Shrek camera meme basically closed the book on that chapter of meme history.
24740	30620	When a boilerplate Impact font image macro meme manages to one-up your entire genre,
30620	32500	you know it's probably time to move on.
32500	35860	Who knows, maybe Impact text is the new dank.
35860	41940	Uh oh, it's a trendy sports image which is usually a death sentence for any meme.
41940	44180	So is it bad that I kinda like it?
44180	48580	Maybe it's because this image can so accurately depict how I feel about some of the other
48580	51920	memes on this list.
51920	56600	As soon as this thing came out, I told you all that this meme sucked, and you all jumped
56600	58960	down my throat calling me the fun police.
58960	64080	Well guess what morons, this shitty meme died after three days and was never heard from
64080	65080	again.
65080	69240	Snap, that one's going in my told you so compilation.
69240	70840	Sucks!
70840	72880	What's even the point of this meme?
72880	75040	You're just stating a preference.
75040	79800	Why waste all this useless rigamarole at the top when all you're saying is, duh this thing
79800	81160	is the best.
81160	83400	What a worthless excuse for a meme.
83400	86000	What are you possibly doing?
86000	91280	This meme is eh, pretty interchangeable, not too innovative, not really even that funny,
91280	95080	and I'm pretty sure the only reason this got popular was because there was pretty much
95080	100020	nothing else going on in the meme world at the time.
100020	106400	This is a meme specifically engineered by Roasty Thought Whores in an attempt to socially
106400	108720	engineer the normie population.
108720	112120	Do not share this meme under any circumstances.
112120	113260	This is not a drill.
113260	116320	I am officially putting this meme under quarantine.
116320	121800	Uh oh, a four panel webcomic meme template.
121800	123440	Is this Lost 2?
123440	128520	Sadly no, it's just a marginally funny meme.
128520	130920	It's just ALMAO 2.
130920	135220	But that was from three years ago and this meme is different enough to stand on its own.
135220	140360	I guess we're starting to run out of original meme archetypes and recycling old memes is
140360	141460	just easier.
141460	144660	I guess Despacito 2 may have been onto something.
144660	145660	It's been done.
145660	150220	Ah now this is the real Lost 2.
150220	155260	Finally we seem to have a new minimalist template to carry the torch from Lost.
155260	159500	These types of memes are really solid and unlike most memes these days they actually
159500	160500	last a while.
160500	164780	I hope to see more like them in the future.
164780	168940	From the creators of the Spongebob title card meme comes playing a random sound over
168940	170780	a scene from Regular Show.
170780	173660	Seriously this is so bland and unoriginal.
173660	177220	YouTube poopers were making these memes back in 2010.
177220	181580	And yeah I get that it's hard to make an original meme these days but if you're gonna shamelessly
181580	186220	recycle ideas you could at least make it funny like Howard the Alien.
186220	189780	This Regular Show meme is so lame that I think it gave me ligma.
189780	194260	Lick my balls!
194260	197200	Well that's all the memes for June and July.
197200	199420	Some good some not so good.
199420	203700	Why call the series memes of the month if you're just gonna arbitrarily skip months
203700	205740	whenever you feel like it?
205740	206900	That's a good question.
