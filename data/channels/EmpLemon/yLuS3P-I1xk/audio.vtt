00:00.000 --> 00:12.720
This meme kind of felt like the end of an era.

00:12.720 --> 00:17.900
There was once a time when Shrek and Cringe Culture were apex contenders of dankness.

00:17.900 --> 00:20.120
Now they're just like all the rest.

00:20.120 --> 00:24.740
The Shrek camera meme basically closed the book on that chapter of meme history.

00:24.740 --> 00:30.620
When a boilerplate Impact font image macro meme manages to one-up your entire genre,

00:30.620 --> 00:32.500
you know it's probably time to move on.

00:32.500 --> 00:35.860
Who knows, maybe Impact text is the new dank.

00:35.860 --> 00:41.940
Uh oh, it's a trendy sports image which is usually a death sentence for any meme.

00:41.940 --> 00:44.180
So is it bad that I kinda like it?

00:44.180 --> 00:48.580
Maybe it's because this image can so accurately depict how I feel about some of the other

00:48.580 --> 00:51.920
memes on this list.

00:51.920 --> 00:56.600
As soon as this thing came out, I told you all that this meme sucked, and you all jumped

00:56.600 --> 00:58.960
down my throat calling me the fun police.

00:58.960 --> 01:04.080
Well guess what morons, this shitty meme died after three days and was never heard from

01:04.080 --> 01:05.080
again.

01:05.080 --> 01:09.240
Snap, that one's going in my told you so compilation.

01:09.240 --> 01:10.840
Sucks!

01:10.840 --> 01:12.880
What's even the point of this meme?

01:12.880 --> 01:15.040
You're just stating a preference.

01:15.040 --> 01:19.800
Why waste all this useless rigamarole at the top when all you're saying is, duh this thing

01:19.800 --> 01:21.160
is the best.

01:21.160 --> 01:23.400
What a worthless excuse for a meme.

01:23.400 --> 01:26.000
What are you possibly doing?

01:26.000 --> 01:31.280
This meme is eh, pretty interchangeable, not too innovative, not really even that funny,

01:31.280 --> 01:35.080
and I'm pretty sure the only reason this got popular was because there was pretty much

01:35.080 --> 01:40.020
nothing else going on in the meme world at the time.

01:40.020 --> 01:46.400
This is a meme specifically engineered by Roasty Thought Whores in an attempt to socially

01:46.400 --> 01:48.720
engineer the normie population.

01:48.720 --> 01:52.120
Do not share this meme under any circumstances.

01:52.120 --> 01:53.260
This is not a drill.

01:53.260 --> 01:56.320
I am officially putting this meme under quarantine.

01:56.320 --> 02:01.800
Uh oh, a four panel webcomic meme template.

02:01.800 --> 02:03.440
Is this Lost 2?

02:03.440 --> 02:08.520
Sadly no, it's just a marginally funny meme.

02:08.520 --> 02:10.920
It's just ALMAO 2.

02:10.920 --> 02:15.220
But that was from three years ago and this meme is different enough to stand on its own.

02:15.220 --> 02:20.360
I guess we're starting to run out of original meme archetypes and recycling old memes is

02:20.360 --> 02:21.460
just easier.

02:21.460 --> 02:24.660
I guess Despacito 2 may have been onto something.

02:24.660 --> 02:25.660
It's been done.

02:25.660 --> 02:30.220
Ah now this is the real Lost 2.

02:30.220 --> 02:35.260
Finally we seem to have a new minimalist template to carry the torch from Lost.

02:35.260 --> 02:39.500
These types of memes are really solid and unlike most memes these days they actually

02:39.500 --> 02:40.500
last a while.

02:40.500 --> 02:44.780
I hope to see more like them in the future.

02:44.780 --> 02:48.940
From the creators of the Spongebob title card meme comes playing a random sound over

02:48.940 --> 02:50.780
a scene from Regular Show.

02:50.780 --> 02:53.660
Seriously this is so bland and unoriginal.

02:53.660 --> 02:57.220
YouTube poopers were making these memes back in 2010.

02:57.220 --> 03:01.580
And yeah I get that it's hard to make an original meme these days but if you're gonna shamelessly

03:01.580 --> 03:06.220
recycle ideas you could at least make it funny like Howard the Alien.

03:06.220 --> 03:09.780
This Regular Show meme is so lame that I think it gave me ligma.

03:09.780 --> 03:14.260
Lick my balls!

03:14.260 --> 03:17.200
Well that's all the memes for June and July.

03:17.200 --> 03:19.420
Some good some not so good.

03:19.420 --> 03:23.700
Why call the series memes of the month if you're just gonna arbitrarily skip months

03:23.700 --> 03:25.740
whenever you feel like it?

03:25.740 --> 03:26.900
That's a good question.
