1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:12,720
This meme kind of felt like the end of an era.

2
00:00:12,720 --> 00:00:17,900
There was once a time when Shrek and Cringe Culture were apex contenders of dankness.

3
00:00:17,900 --> 00:00:20,120
Now they're just like all the rest.

4
00:00:20,120 --> 00:00:24,740
The Shrek camera meme basically closed the book on that chapter of meme history.

5
00:00:24,740 --> 00:00:30,620
When a boilerplate Impact font image macro meme manages to one-up your entire genre,

6
00:00:30,620 --> 00:00:32,500
you know it's probably time to move on.

7
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:35,860
Who knows, maybe Impact text is the new dank.

8
00:00:35,860 --> 00:00:41,940
Uh oh, it's a trendy sports image which is usually a death sentence for any meme.

9
00:00:41,940 --> 00:00:44,180
So is it bad that I kinda like it?

10
00:00:44,180 --> 00:00:48,580
Maybe it's because this image can so accurately depict how I feel about some of the other

11
00:00:48,580 --> 00:00:51,920
memes on this list.

12
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:56,600
As soon as this thing came out, I told you all that this meme sucked, and you all jumped

13
00:00:56,600 --> 00:00:58,960
down my throat calling me the fun police.

14
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:04,080
Well guess what morons, this shitty meme died after three days and was never heard from

15
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:05,080
again.

16
00:01:05,080 --> 00:01:09,240
Snap, that one's going in my told you so compilation.

17
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:10,840
Sucks!

18
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:12,880
What's even the point of this meme?

19
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:15,040
You're just stating a preference.

20
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:19,800
Why waste all this useless rigamarole at the top when all you're saying is, duh this thing

21
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:21,160
is the best.

22
00:01:21,160 --> 00:01:23,400
What a worthless excuse for a meme.

23
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:26,000
What are you possibly doing?

24
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:31,280
This meme is eh, pretty interchangeable, not too innovative, not really even that funny,

25
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:35,080
and I'm pretty sure the only reason this got popular was because there was pretty much

26
00:01:35,080 --> 00:01:40,020
nothing else going on in the meme world at the time.

27
00:01:40,020 --> 00:01:46,400
This is a meme specifically engineered by Roasty Thought Whores in an attempt to socially

28
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:48,720
engineer the normie population.

29
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:52,120
Do not share this meme under any circumstances.

30
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:53,260
This is not a drill.

31
00:01:53,260 --> 00:01:56,320
I am officially putting this meme under quarantine.

32
00:01:56,320 --> 00:02:01,800
Uh oh, a four panel webcomic meme template.

33
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:03,440
Is this Lost 2?

34
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:08,520
Sadly no, it's just a marginally funny meme.

35
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:10,920
It's just ALMAO 2.

36
00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:15,220
But that was from three years ago and this meme is different enough to stand on its own.

37
00:02:15,220 --> 00:02:20,360
I guess we're starting to run out of original meme archetypes and recycling old memes is

38
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:21,460
just easier.

39
00:02:21,460 --> 00:02:24,660
I guess Despacito 2 may have been onto something.

40
00:02:24,660 --> 00:02:25,660
It's been done.

41
00:02:25,660 --> 00:02:30,220
Ah now this is the real Lost 2.

42
00:02:30,220 --> 00:02:35,260
Finally we seem to have a new minimalist template to carry the torch from Lost.

43
00:02:35,260 --> 00:02:39,500
These types of memes are really solid and unlike most memes these days they actually

44
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:40,500
last a while.

45
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:44,780
I hope to see more like them in the future.

46
00:02:44,780 --> 00:02:48,940
From the creators of the Spongebob title card meme comes playing a random sound over

47
00:02:48,940 --> 00:02:50,780
a scene from Regular Show.

48
00:02:50,780 --> 00:02:53,660
Seriously this is so bland and unoriginal.

49
00:02:53,660 --> 00:02:57,220
YouTube poopers were making these memes back in 2010.

50
00:02:57,220 --> 00:03:01,580
And yeah I get that it's hard to make an original meme these days but if you're gonna shamelessly

51
00:03:01,580 --> 00:03:06,220
recycle ideas you could at least make it funny like Howard the Alien.

52
00:03:06,220 --> 00:03:09,780
This Regular Show meme is so lame that I think it gave me ligma.

53
00:03:09,780 --> 00:03:14,260
Lick my balls!

54
00:03:14,260 --> 00:03:17,200
Well that's all the memes for June and July.

55
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:19,420
Some good some not so good.

56
00:03:19,420 --> 00:03:23,700
Why call the series memes of the month if you're just gonna arbitrarily skip months

57
00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:25,740
whenever you feel like it?

58
00:03:25,740 --> 00:03:26,900
That's a good question.
