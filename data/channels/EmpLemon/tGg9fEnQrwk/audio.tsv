0	10800	Steamed Hams is what every meme should strive to be.
10800	13600	This is a meme that's simply cut from a better cloth than the rest.
13600	17600	It's based on one of the best scenes of all time from one of the best TV shows of all time,
17600	20500	and you better believe it's one of the best memes of all time.
20500	27500	Steamed Hams is a logical progression of memes like The Nutshack and the We Are Number One edits that were popular in late 2016,
27500	30600	and it continues to advance and evolve the genre.
30600	33600	In an age where most memes have become predictable and stale,
33600	38200	Steamed Hams asks of its memers to think outside the box if they wish to find success.
38200	41800	Ironically, in order for a memer to make a popular Steamed Hams meme,
41800	45600	they must think as delightfully devilish as Skinner in the very scene they're editing.
45600	49900	The sheer variety and creativity displayed through this meme contributes to its longevity.
49900	53100	While most modern memes struggle to remain relevant for more than a week,
53100	58400	Steamed Hams has gradually risen in popularity over an entire year, and it's still going strong.
58400	62700	This meme actually reminds me a lot of the stew chocolate pudding meme from many years ago,
62700	65000	except Steamed Hams is even better.
