1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,800
Steamed Hams is what every meme should strive to be.

2
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:13,600
This is a meme that's simply cut from a better cloth than the rest.

3
00:00:13,600 --> 00:00:17,600
It's based on one of the best scenes of all time from one of the best TV shows of all time,

4
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:20,500
and you better believe it's one of the best memes of all time.

5
00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:27,500
Steamed Hams is a logical progression of memes like The Nutshack and the We Are Number One edits that were popular in late 2016,

6
00:00:27,500 --> 00:00:30,600
and it continues to advance and evolve the genre.

7
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:33,600
In an age where most memes have become predictable and stale,

8
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:38,200
Steamed Hams asks of its memers to think outside the box if they wish to find success.

9
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:41,800
Ironically, in order for a memer to make a popular Steamed Hams meme,

10
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:45,600
they must think as delightfully devilish as Skinner in the very scene they're editing.

11
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:49,900
The sheer variety and creativity displayed through this meme contributes to its longevity.

12
00:00:49,900 --> 00:00:53,100
While most modern memes struggle to remain relevant for more than a week,

13
00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:58,400
Steamed Hams has gradually risen in popularity over an entire year, and it's still going strong.

14
00:00:58,400 --> 00:01:02,700
This meme actually reminds me a lot of the stew chocolate pudding meme from many years ago,

15
00:01:02,700 --> 00:01:05,000
except Steamed Hams is even better.
