00:00.000 --> 00:05.700
People of YouTube, it is I, everyone's favorite YouTuber, EmperorLemon.

00:05.700 --> 00:10.400
And today I'm coming at you guys with an unscripted commentary.

00:10.400 --> 00:15.000
Gonna be trying to work on more unscripted commentaries in the future.

00:15.000 --> 00:18.900
Throw out the scripts.

00:18.900 --> 00:23.900
So let me know if you enjoy unscripted commentaries.

00:23.900 --> 00:33.900
And today, on this wonderful summer afternoon, I have come here to talk to you about some YouTube news.

00:33.900 --> 00:39.200
And no, this isn't about YouTube getting rid of thumbnails for 0.3% of users.

00:39.200 --> 00:47.300
Oh no, I can no longer see people making ridiculous facial expressions on a brightly colored background with bold impact text.

00:47.300 --> 00:50.900
Whatever will I do? My YouTube experience is ruined.

00:50.900 --> 00:53.100
No, no, no, no. This isn't about that.

00:53.100 --> 01:00.100
All you people need to relax out there, YouTube custom thumbnails aren't going anywhere, okay?

01:00.100 --> 01:09.100
Do you seriously think that YouTube, out of all companies, is gonna try to make an effort to remove clickbait?

01:09.100 --> 01:10.900
Are you kidding me?

01:10.900 --> 01:14.100
But no, that didn't stop everyone from raising hell over it.

01:14.100 --> 01:19.600
And yeah, I get the point, oh it's a shady experiment, oh they just sprung it on us without telling us.

01:19.600 --> 01:22.600
And to that I have to say, come on, it's YouTube.

01:22.600 --> 01:24.600
Like this is just par for the course for them.

01:24.600 --> 01:31.300
Yeah it's shady, yeah they probably shouldn't randomly experiment with random YouTube users without their consent,

01:31.300 --> 01:35.600
but come on, they've been doing this stuff for the last three years.

01:35.600 --> 01:38.600
So I don't really see why this should be that big of a problem.

01:38.600 --> 01:45.100
YouTube is absolutely not getting rid of custom thumbnails, so everyone should stop worrying about it.

01:45.100 --> 01:55.100
What you should worry about is this actual piece of YouTube news, which is literally about YouTube and the news industry.

01:55.100 --> 02:05.600
I can't do it! Do it live. Do it live!!

02:05.600 --> 02:07.100
Etf

02:07.100 --> 02:11.960
And it comes from everyone's favorite YouTube CEO.

02:12.100 --> 02:13.100
Old W.

02:13.100 --> 02:19.160
Susan Wojcickuchuchuch manages to make the safety-

02:19.160 --> 02:27.500
coming out with a brand new announcement that YouTube has invested $25 million to, quote,

02:27.500 --> 02:31.540
support the future of news in online video.

02:31.540 --> 02:38.360
So what they've done, apparently, is make a significant investment towards emphasizing

02:38.360 --> 02:43.840
trusted news sources such as Fox News and CNN.

02:44.020 --> 02:49.860
Because if I want to tune into some very accurate and unscued, unbiased news, the first thing

02:49.860 --> 02:54.000
I think of is Fox News and CNN.

02:54.000 --> 02:56.860
Tide goes in, tide goes out, never a miscommunication.

02:56.860 --> 02:58.200
You can't explain that.

02:58.200 --> 02:59.660
I don't know what that means!

02:59.660 --> 03:04.640
So clearly what YouTube is doing, they have once again sided with corporate interests

03:04.640 --> 03:11.080
rather than the interests of common YouTubers by choosing to promote mainstream media legacy

03:11.080 --> 03:13.480
news sources on their platform.

03:13.480 --> 03:19.160
And they're doing this at a time when the public's trust in the mainstream news media

03:19.160 --> 03:20.840
has never been lower.

03:20.840 --> 03:26.160
And there's a pretty good reason behind that trend, considering that ever since the 2016

03:26.160 --> 03:32.640
election, the mainstream media in America has become so unbelievably biased that it's

03:32.640 --> 03:34.640
beyond absurd at this point.

03:34.640 --> 03:36.400
He's not still going to be president by May.

03:36.400 --> 03:40.080
He's not still going to be president by May.

03:40.080 --> 03:41.080
That's it!

03:41.080 --> 03:42.080
Oh!

03:42.080 --> 03:43.080
Oh!

03:43.680 --> 03:46.520
When you talk about George Bush, I mean, say what you want, the World Trade Center came

03:46.520 --> 03:48.040
down during his time.

03:59.320 --> 04:02.960
So you can go take a look at the blog that Google posted.

04:02.960 --> 04:07.460
I'll put a link to it in the description and you'll see them give their glossy little explanation

04:07.460 --> 04:11.040
for all this, but we all really know why they're doing this.

04:11.040 --> 04:16.360
They'll tell you it's about the integrity and the trusted news sources.

04:16.360 --> 04:20.120
But really, really, they don't care about any of that.

04:20.120 --> 04:23.040
This is strictly a business decision.

04:23.040 --> 04:29.540
YouTube, the corporation, YouTube, they have been getting hammered in the media lately.

04:29.540 --> 04:34.960
Whenever you see a story about YouTube in the mainstream media, it's not positive.

04:34.960 --> 04:41.920
99% of the time, it's going to be about some stupid YouTube vlogger doing a stupid thing,

04:41.920 --> 04:47.920
or it's going to be an investigative hit piece made for fat soccer moms talking about how

04:47.920 --> 04:53.080
YouTube is so dangerous for your children.

04:53.080 --> 04:57.800
So it's very clear that heading into this year, YouTube's portrayal in the news media

04:57.800 --> 05:00.400
has been overwhelmingly negative.

05:00.400 --> 05:02.400
But hey, would you look at this?

05:02.400 --> 05:06.780
YouTube is suddenly partnering with the mainstream news media.

05:06.780 --> 05:08.720
How about that?

05:08.720 --> 05:13.060
Definitely can't see any conflicts of interest here that would prevent the news media from

05:13.060 --> 05:17.440
reporting on anything negative about YouTube anymore.

05:17.440 --> 05:18.880
So that's why they're doing this.

05:18.880 --> 05:20.300
Let's be real here.

05:20.300 --> 05:24.900
Legacy Media knows that their audience is tuning out by the millions because of their

05:24.900 --> 05:32.780
horribly tilted and inaccurate coverage of pretty much every news story since 2016.

05:32.780 --> 05:35.280
They know they're losing their audience.

05:35.280 --> 05:41.380
They know young people don't give a shit about the CBS evening news.

05:41.380 --> 05:46.100
They know they're struggling and they know their future as an industry is in complete

05:46.100 --> 05:47.100
jeopardy.

05:47.100 --> 05:49.200
I love the young people.

05:49.200 --> 05:53.220
So YouTube comes up to them and they're probably like, all right, you guys, I'll cut you a

05:53.220 --> 05:54.220
deal.

05:54.220 --> 05:56.780
I'm voting the hell out of you on YouTube.

05:56.780 --> 06:02.500
And in exchange, we would like you to sort of downplay all that negative stuff about

06:02.500 --> 06:03.500
YouTube.

06:03.500 --> 06:04.500
Okay?

06:04.500 --> 06:06.020
So that's what's happening on YouTube.

06:06.020 --> 06:11.460
And in the near future, you're probably going to see a lot more news pop up on your homepage.

06:11.460 --> 06:18.060
And just like always, you will ignore it and watch an actual YouTuber instead of the news

06:18.060 --> 06:23.980
because YouTube audiences don't care about mainstream news.

06:23.980 --> 06:28.180
YouTube audiences want to get their news from YouTubers.

06:28.180 --> 06:31.540
Does that make the least bit of sense to you guys?

06:31.540 --> 06:38.060
Say what you want about Philly D, Keemstar, Scarce.

06:38.060 --> 06:43.620
But there's a reason these guys get millions upon millions of views while videos from official

06:43.620 --> 06:48.340
news sources often struggle to break 50,000 views.

06:48.340 --> 06:50.840
YouTubers are far more compelling.

06:50.840 --> 06:54.960
YouTubers have a much stronger connection to the actual audience.

06:54.960 --> 07:00.960
But once again, it's yet another branch of YouTube where the homegrown grassroots independent

07:00.960 --> 07:06.080
creators are going to get bullied out of existence by corporate interests.

07:06.080 --> 07:09.840
And it's a shame, but at the same time, I can't say I'm surprised.

07:09.840 --> 07:15.480
I talked about this same exact thing happening in my video last year about YouTube's downward

07:15.480 --> 07:16.520
spiral.

07:16.520 --> 07:21.760
It's no secret that for the longest time now, YouTube has been continuously siding with

07:21.760 --> 07:28.720
mainstream and corporate entities rather than their genuine homegrown creators.

07:28.720 --> 07:33.540
Ever since old W took over, it just seems like this website has been continually getting

07:33.540 --> 07:35.720
more and more corporate.

07:35.720 --> 07:40.600
And I'm not going to sit here and say that's necessarily a 100% bad thing.

07:40.600 --> 07:43.800
It sure is a good thing from YouTube's perspective.

07:43.800 --> 07:49.360
Especially for them, hedging all these business relationships with dependent dying media industries

07:49.360 --> 07:52.360
is certainly going to help them stick around in the long run.

07:52.360 --> 07:56.300
So from a strictly business perspective, it makes perfect sense for them.

07:56.300 --> 08:01.600
But at the same time, I can't help but wonder just how disconnected the higher ups at YouTube

08:01.600 --> 08:03.880
are from their core audience.

08:03.880 --> 08:10.300
People on YouTube don't want to watch the NBC Nightly News with Lester Holt.

08:10.300 --> 08:12.560
People on YouTube want to follow personalities.

08:12.560 --> 08:17.520
They don't want to follow some corporate puppet that's been put in his position by

08:17.520 --> 08:19.720
an industry think tank.

08:19.720 --> 08:24.060
And once again, you can prove that idea by just looking at the views.

08:24.060 --> 08:27.960
YouTube audiences don't care about the legacy media.

08:27.960 --> 08:32.320
And YouTube ramming them down our throats certainly isn't going to change that.

08:32.320 --> 08:36.320
As a matter of fact, it'll probably make us like them less.

08:36.320 --> 08:41.000
And strictly speaking from the perspective of a YouTube viewer, you're damn right I'm

08:41.000 --> 08:47.280
going to choose an independent YouTube news personality over a mainstream media corporation.

08:47.280 --> 08:53.160
Why would I side with an entity who has time and time again been proven to be a bunch of

08:53.160 --> 08:59.240
liars, hypocrites, and scam artists who want to do nothing more than push an agenda and

08:59.240 --> 09:02.760
conform to corporate interests?

09:02.760 --> 09:09.700
I don't care how fair and accurate they claim to be.

09:09.700 --> 09:14.540
If I'm going to be getting opinion-based news, I might as well get it from the independent

09:14.540 --> 09:18.460
YouTuber who's not in the pocket of a massive corporation.

09:18.460 --> 09:22.500
So yeah, you're damn right I'm going to choose the guy who can actually speak freely

09:22.500 --> 09:23.960
about issues.

09:23.960 --> 09:28.660
But now in order to protect their investment, YouTube is probably going to downplay all

09:28.660 --> 09:31.540
of those channels, which is a damn shame.

09:31.540 --> 09:33.220
They'll call them fake news.

09:33.220 --> 09:36.380
They'll call them conspiracy theorists.

09:36.380 --> 09:40.140
They'll call them racist, alt-right, radical, whatever.

09:40.140 --> 09:45.540
And meanwhile, at the same time that they'll slander all of their honest, independent,

09:45.540 --> 09:51.180
free-thinking YouTubers, they'll turn around and shove the corrupt mainstream media right

09:51.180 --> 09:52.380
down your throat.

09:52.380 --> 09:56.340
And obviously, like I said, it's not going to make us like them anymore.

09:56.340 --> 10:02.580
But as far as YouTube's concerned, that $25 million investment is worth every penny to

10:02.580 --> 10:08.220
make sure that the mainstream media doesn't really talk about YouTube's problems anymore.

10:08.220 --> 10:10.860
So that's what's going on in YouTube right now.

10:10.860 --> 10:13.500
Feel free to care about it, or don't.

10:13.500 --> 10:15.500
This is the end of the video.

10:15.500 --> 10:16.500
Goodbye!

10:17.500 --> 10:18.500
What the hell is this?

10:18.500 --> 10:22.500
Austin face-to-face with McMahon!

10:22.500 --> 10:24.500
They're shaking hands!

10:24.500 --> 10:26.500
Don't call his shaking hands!

10:26.500 --> 10:28.500
We're saving himself!

10:28.500 --> 10:33.500
For the love of God, someone tell me this is not happening!

10:33.500 --> 10:35.500
It's happening!

10:35.500 --> 10:41.500
Stone Cold Steve Austin has sold his soul for the WWS title!
