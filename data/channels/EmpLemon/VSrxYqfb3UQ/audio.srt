1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,700
People of YouTube, it is I, everyone's favorite YouTuber, EmperorLemon.

2
00:00:05,700 --> 00:00:10,400
And today I'm coming at you guys with an unscripted commentary.

3
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:15,000
Gonna be trying to work on more unscripted commentaries in the future.

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,900
Throw out the scripts.

5
00:00:18,900 --> 00:00:23,900
So let me know if you enjoy unscripted commentaries.

6
00:00:23,900 --> 00:00:33,900
And today, on this wonderful summer afternoon, I have come here to talk to you about some YouTube news.

7
00:00:33,900 --> 00:00:39,200
And no, this isn't about YouTube getting rid of thumbnails for 0.3% of users.

8
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:47,300
Oh no, I can no longer see people making ridiculous facial expressions on a brightly colored background with bold impact text.

9
00:00:47,300 --> 00:00:50,900
Whatever will I do? My YouTube experience is ruined.

10
00:00:50,900 --> 00:00:53,100
No, no, no, no. This isn't about that.

11
00:00:53,100 --> 00:01:00,100
All you people need to relax out there, YouTube custom thumbnails aren't going anywhere, okay?

12
00:01:00,100 --> 00:01:09,100
Do you seriously think that YouTube, out of all companies, is gonna try to make an effort to remove clickbait?

13
00:01:09,100 --> 00:01:10,900
Are you kidding me?

14
00:01:10,900 --> 00:01:14,100
But no, that didn't stop everyone from raising hell over it.

15
00:01:14,100 --> 00:01:19,600
And yeah, I get the point, oh it's a shady experiment, oh they just sprung it on us without telling us.

16
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:22,600
And to that I have to say, come on, it's YouTube.

17
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:24,600
Like this is just par for the course for them.

18
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:31,300
Yeah it's shady, yeah they probably shouldn't randomly experiment with random YouTube users without their consent,

19
00:01:31,300 --> 00:01:35,600
but come on, they've been doing this stuff for the last three years.

20
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:38,600
So I don't really see why this should be that big of a problem.

21
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:45,100
YouTube is absolutely not getting rid of custom thumbnails, so everyone should stop worrying about it.

22
00:01:45,100 --> 00:01:55,100
What you should worry about is this actual piece of YouTube news, which is literally about YouTube and the news industry.

23
00:01:55,100 --> 00:02:05,600
I can't do it! Do it live. Do it live!!

24
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:07,100
Etf

25
00:02:07,100 --> 00:02:11,960
And it comes from everyone's favorite YouTube CEO.

26
00:02:12,100 --> 00:02:13,100
Old W.

27
00:02:13,100 --> 00:02:19,160
Susan Wojcickuchuchuch manages to make the safety-

28
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:27,500
coming out with a brand new announcement that YouTube has invested $25 million to, quote,

29
00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:31,540
support the future of news in online video.

30
00:02:31,540 --> 00:02:38,360
So what they've done, apparently, is make a significant investment towards emphasizing

31
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:43,840
trusted news sources such as Fox News and CNN.

32
00:02:44,020 --> 00:02:49,860
Because if I want to tune into some very accurate and unscued, unbiased news, the first thing

33
00:02:49,860 --> 00:02:54,000
I think of is Fox News and CNN.

34
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,860
Tide goes in, tide goes out, never a miscommunication.

35
00:02:56,860 --> 00:02:58,200
You can't explain that.

36
00:02:58,200 --> 00:02:59,660
I don't know what that means!

37
00:02:59,660 --> 00:03:04,640
So clearly what YouTube is doing, they have once again sided with corporate interests

38
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:11,080
rather than the interests of common YouTubers by choosing to promote mainstream media legacy

39
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:13,480
news sources on their platform.

40
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:19,160
And they're doing this at a time when the public's trust in the mainstream news media

41
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:20,840
has never been lower.

42
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:26,160
And there's a pretty good reason behind that trend, considering that ever since the 2016

43
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:32,640
election, the mainstream media in America has become so unbelievably biased that it's

44
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:34,640
beyond absurd at this point.

45
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:36,400
He's not still going to be president by May.

46
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:40,080
He's not still going to be president by May.

47
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:41,080
That's it!

48
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:42,080
Oh!

49
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:43,080
Oh!

50
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:46,520
When you talk about George Bush, I mean, say what you want, the World Trade Center came

51
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:48,040
down during his time.

52
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:02,960
So you can go take a look at the blog that Google posted.

53
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:07,460
I'll put a link to it in the description and you'll see them give their glossy little explanation

54
00:04:07,460 --> 00:04:11,040
for all this, but we all really know why they're doing this.

55
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:16,360
They'll tell you it's about the integrity and the trusted news sources.

56
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:20,120
But really, really, they don't care about any of that.

57
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:23,040
This is strictly a business decision.

58
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:29,540
YouTube, the corporation, YouTube, they have been getting hammered in the media lately.

59
00:04:29,540 --> 00:04:34,960
Whenever you see a story about YouTube in the mainstream media, it's not positive.

60
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:41,920
99% of the time, it's going to be about some stupid YouTube vlogger doing a stupid thing,

61
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:47,920
or it's going to be an investigative hit piece made for fat soccer moms talking about how

62
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:53,080
YouTube is so dangerous for your children.

63
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:57,800
So it's very clear that heading into this year, YouTube's portrayal in the news media

64
00:04:57,800 --> 00:05:00,400
has been overwhelmingly negative.

65
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:02,400
But hey, would you look at this?

66
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:06,780
YouTube is suddenly partnering with the mainstream news media.

67
00:05:06,780 --> 00:05:08,720
How about that?

68
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:13,060
Definitely can't see any conflicts of interest here that would prevent the news media from

69
00:05:13,060 --> 00:05:17,440
reporting on anything negative about YouTube anymore.

70
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:18,880
So that's why they're doing this.

71
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:20,300
Let's be real here.

72
00:05:20,300 --> 00:05:24,900
Legacy Media knows that their audience is tuning out by the millions because of their

73
00:05:24,900 --> 00:05:32,780
horribly tilted and inaccurate coverage of pretty much every news story since 2016.

74
00:05:32,780 --> 00:05:35,280
They know they're losing their audience.

75
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:41,380
They know young people don't give a shit about the CBS evening news.

76
00:05:41,380 --> 00:05:46,100
They know they're struggling and they know their future as an industry is in complete

77
00:05:46,100 --> 00:05:47,100
jeopardy.

78
00:05:47,100 --> 00:05:49,200
I love the young people.

79
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:53,220
So YouTube comes up to them and they're probably like, all right, you guys, I'll cut you a

80
00:05:53,220 --> 00:05:54,220
deal.

81
00:05:54,220 --> 00:05:56,780
I'm voting the hell out of you on YouTube.

82
00:05:56,780 --> 00:06:02,500
And in exchange, we would like you to sort of downplay all that negative stuff about

83
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:03,500
YouTube.

84
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:04,500
Okay?

85
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:06,020
So that's what's happening on YouTube.

86
00:06:06,020 --> 00:06:11,460
And in the near future, you're probably going to see a lot more news pop up on your homepage.

87
00:06:11,460 --> 00:06:18,060
And just like always, you will ignore it and watch an actual YouTuber instead of the news

88
00:06:18,060 --> 00:06:23,980
because YouTube audiences don't care about mainstream news.

89
00:06:23,980 --> 00:06:28,180
YouTube audiences want to get their news from YouTubers.

90
00:06:28,180 --> 00:06:31,540
Does that make the least bit of sense to you guys?

91
00:06:31,540 --> 00:06:38,060
Say what you want about Philly D, Keemstar, Scarce.

92
00:06:38,060 --> 00:06:43,620
But there's a reason these guys get millions upon millions of views while videos from official

93
00:06:43,620 --> 00:06:48,340
news sources often struggle to break 50,000 views.

94
00:06:48,340 --> 00:06:50,840
YouTubers are far more compelling.

95
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:54,960
YouTubers have a much stronger connection to the actual audience.

96
00:06:54,960 --> 00:07:00,960
But once again, it's yet another branch of YouTube where the homegrown grassroots independent

97
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:06,080
creators are going to get bullied out of existence by corporate interests.

98
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:09,840
And it's a shame, but at the same time, I can't say I'm surprised.

99
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:15,480
I talked about this same exact thing happening in my video last year about YouTube's downward

100
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:16,520
spiral.

101
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:21,760
It's no secret that for the longest time now, YouTube has been continuously siding with

102
00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:28,720
mainstream and corporate entities rather than their genuine homegrown creators.

103
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:33,540
Ever since old W took over, it just seems like this website has been continually getting

104
00:07:33,540 --> 00:07:35,720
more and more corporate.

105
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:40,600
And I'm not going to sit here and say that's necessarily a 100% bad thing.

106
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:43,800
It sure is a good thing from YouTube's perspective.

107
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:49,360
Especially for them, hedging all these business relationships with dependent dying media industries

108
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:52,360
is certainly going to help them stick around in the long run.

109
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:56,300
So from a strictly business perspective, it makes perfect sense for them.

110
00:07:56,300 --> 00:08:01,600
But at the same time, I can't help but wonder just how disconnected the higher ups at YouTube

111
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:03,880
are from their core audience.

112
00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:10,300
People on YouTube don't want to watch the NBC Nightly News with Lester Holt.

113
00:08:10,300 --> 00:08:12,560
People on YouTube want to follow personalities.

114
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:17,520
They don't want to follow some corporate puppet that's been put in his position by

115
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:19,720
an industry think tank.

116
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:24,060
And once again, you can prove that idea by just looking at the views.

117
00:08:24,060 --> 00:08:27,960
YouTube audiences don't care about the legacy media.

118
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:32,320
And YouTube ramming them down our throats certainly isn't going to change that.

119
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:36,320
As a matter of fact, it'll probably make us like them less.

120
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:41,000
And strictly speaking from the perspective of a YouTube viewer, you're damn right I'm

121
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:47,280
going to choose an independent YouTube news personality over a mainstream media corporation.

122
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:53,160
Why would I side with an entity who has time and time again been proven to be a bunch of

123
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:59,240
liars, hypocrites, and scam artists who want to do nothing more than push an agenda and

124
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:02,760
conform to corporate interests?

125
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:09,700
I don't care how fair and accurate they claim to be.

126
00:09:09,700 --> 00:09:14,540
If I'm going to be getting opinion-based news, I might as well get it from the independent

127
00:09:14,540 --> 00:09:18,460
YouTuber who's not in the pocket of a massive corporation.

128
00:09:18,460 --> 00:09:22,500
So yeah, you're damn right I'm going to choose the guy who can actually speak freely

129
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:23,960
about issues.

130
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:28,660
But now in order to protect their investment, YouTube is probably going to downplay all

131
00:09:28,660 --> 00:09:31,540
of those channels, which is a damn shame.

132
00:09:31,540 --> 00:09:33,220
They'll call them fake news.

133
00:09:33,220 --> 00:09:36,380
They'll call them conspiracy theorists.

134
00:09:36,380 --> 00:09:40,140
They'll call them racist, alt-right, radical, whatever.

135
00:09:40,140 --> 00:09:45,540
And meanwhile, at the same time that they'll slander all of their honest, independent,

136
00:09:45,540 --> 00:09:51,180
free-thinking YouTubers, they'll turn around and shove the corrupt mainstream media right

137
00:09:51,180 --> 00:09:52,380
down your throat.

138
00:09:52,380 --> 00:09:56,340
And obviously, like I said, it's not going to make us like them anymore.

139
00:09:56,340 --> 00:10:02,580
But as far as YouTube's concerned, that $25 million investment is worth every penny to

140
00:10:02,580 --> 00:10:08,220
make sure that the mainstream media doesn't really talk about YouTube's problems anymore.

141
00:10:08,220 --> 00:10:10,860
So that's what's going on in YouTube right now.

142
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:13,500
Feel free to care about it, or don't.

143
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:15,500
This is the end of the video.

144
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:16,500
Goodbye!

145
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:18,500
What the hell is this?

146
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:22,500
Austin face-to-face with McMahon!

147
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:24,500
They're shaking hands!

148
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:26,500
Don't call his shaking hands!

149
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:28,500
We're saving himself!

150
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:33,500
For the love of God, someone tell me this is not happening!

151
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:35,500
It's happening!

152
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:41,500
Stone Cold Steve Austin has sold his soul for the WWS title!
