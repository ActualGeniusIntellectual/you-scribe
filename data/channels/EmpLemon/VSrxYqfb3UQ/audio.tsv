0	5700	People of YouTube, it is I, everyone's favorite YouTuber, EmperorLemon.
5700	10400	And today I'm coming at you guys with an unscripted commentary.
10400	15000	Gonna be trying to work on more unscripted commentaries in the future.
15000	18900	Throw out the scripts.
18900	23900	So let me know if you enjoy unscripted commentaries.
23900	33900	And today, on this wonderful summer afternoon, I have come here to talk to you about some YouTube news.
33900	39200	And no, this isn't about YouTube getting rid of thumbnails for 0.3% of users.
39200	47300	Oh no, I can no longer see people making ridiculous facial expressions on a brightly colored background with bold impact text.
47300	50900	Whatever will I do? My YouTube experience is ruined.
50900	53100	No, no, no, no. This isn't about that.
53100	60100	All you people need to relax out there, YouTube custom thumbnails aren't going anywhere, okay?
60100	69100	Do you seriously think that YouTube, out of all companies, is gonna try to make an effort to remove clickbait?
69100	70900	Are you kidding me?
70900	74100	But no, that didn't stop everyone from raising hell over it.
74100	79600	And yeah, I get the point, oh it's a shady experiment, oh they just sprung it on us without telling us.
79600	82600	And to that I have to say, come on, it's YouTube.
82600	84600	Like this is just par for the course for them.
84600	91300	Yeah it's shady, yeah they probably shouldn't randomly experiment with random YouTube users without their consent,
91300	95600	but come on, they've been doing this stuff for the last three years.
95600	98600	So I don't really see why this should be that big of a problem.
98600	105100	YouTube is absolutely not getting rid of custom thumbnails, so everyone should stop worrying about it.
105100	115100	What you should worry about is this actual piece of YouTube news, which is literally about YouTube and the news industry.
115100	125600	I can't do it! Do it live. Do it live!!
125600	127100	Etf
127100	131960	And it comes from everyone's favorite YouTube CEO.
132100	133100	Old W.
133100	139160	Susan Wojcickuchuchuch manages to make the safety-
139160	147500	coming out with a brand new announcement that YouTube has invested $25 million to, quote,
147500	151540	support the future of news in online video.
151540	158360	So what they've done, apparently, is make a significant investment towards emphasizing
158360	163840	trusted news sources such as Fox News and CNN.
164020	169860	Because if I want to tune into some very accurate and unscued, unbiased news, the first thing
169860	174000	I think of is Fox News and CNN.
174000	176860	Tide goes in, tide goes out, never a miscommunication.
176860	178200	You can't explain that.
178200	179660	I don't know what that means!
179660	184640	So clearly what YouTube is doing, they have once again sided with corporate interests
184640	191080	rather than the interests of common YouTubers by choosing to promote mainstream media legacy
191080	193480	news sources on their platform.
193480	199160	And they're doing this at a time when the public's trust in the mainstream news media
199160	200840	has never been lower.
200840	206160	And there's a pretty good reason behind that trend, considering that ever since the 2016
206160	212640	election, the mainstream media in America has become so unbelievably biased that it's
212640	214640	beyond absurd at this point.
214640	216400	He's not still going to be president by May.
216400	220080	He's not still going to be president by May.
220080	221080	That's it!
221080	222080	Oh!
222080	223080	Oh!
223680	226520	When you talk about George Bush, I mean, say what you want, the World Trade Center came
226520	228040	down during his time.
239320	242960	So you can go take a look at the blog that Google posted.
242960	247460	I'll put a link to it in the description and you'll see them give their glossy little explanation
247460	251040	for all this, but we all really know why they're doing this.
251040	256360	They'll tell you it's about the integrity and the trusted news sources.
256360	260120	But really, really, they don't care about any of that.
260120	263040	This is strictly a business decision.
263040	269540	YouTube, the corporation, YouTube, they have been getting hammered in the media lately.
269540	274960	Whenever you see a story about YouTube in the mainstream media, it's not positive.
274960	281920	99% of the time, it's going to be about some stupid YouTube vlogger doing a stupid thing,
281920	287920	or it's going to be an investigative hit piece made for fat soccer moms talking about how
287920	293080	YouTube is so dangerous for your children.
293080	297800	So it's very clear that heading into this year, YouTube's portrayal in the news media
297800	300400	has been overwhelmingly negative.
300400	302400	But hey, would you look at this?
302400	306780	YouTube is suddenly partnering with the mainstream news media.
306780	308720	How about that?
308720	313060	Definitely can't see any conflicts of interest here that would prevent the news media from
313060	317440	reporting on anything negative about YouTube anymore.
317440	318880	So that's why they're doing this.
318880	320300	Let's be real here.
320300	324900	Legacy Media knows that their audience is tuning out by the millions because of their
324900	332780	horribly tilted and inaccurate coverage of pretty much every news story since 2016.
332780	335280	They know they're losing their audience.
335280	341380	They know young people don't give a shit about the CBS evening news.
341380	346100	They know they're struggling and they know their future as an industry is in complete
346100	347100	jeopardy.
347100	349200	I love the young people.
349200	353220	So YouTube comes up to them and they're probably like, all right, you guys, I'll cut you a
353220	354220	deal.
354220	356780	I'm voting the hell out of you on YouTube.
356780	362500	And in exchange, we would like you to sort of downplay all that negative stuff about
362500	363500	YouTube.
363500	364500	Okay?
364500	366020	So that's what's happening on YouTube.
366020	371460	And in the near future, you're probably going to see a lot more news pop up on your homepage.
371460	378060	And just like always, you will ignore it and watch an actual YouTuber instead of the news
378060	383980	because YouTube audiences don't care about mainstream news.
383980	388180	YouTube audiences want to get their news from YouTubers.
388180	391540	Does that make the least bit of sense to you guys?
391540	398060	Say what you want about Philly D, Keemstar, Scarce.
398060	403620	But there's a reason these guys get millions upon millions of views while videos from official
403620	408340	news sources often struggle to break 50,000 views.
408340	410840	YouTubers are far more compelling.
410840	414960	YouTubers have a much stronger connection to the actual audience.
414960	420960	But once again, it's yet another branch of YouTube where the homegrown grassroots independent
420960	426080	creators are going to get bullied out of existence by corporate interests.
426080	429840	And it's a shame, but at the same time, I can't say I'm surprised.
429840	435480	I talked about this same exact thing happening in my video last year about YouTube's downward
435480	436520	spiral.
436520	441760	It's no secret that for the longest time now, YouTube has been continuously siding with
441760	448720	mainstream and corporate entities rather than their genuine homegrown creators.
448720	453540	Ever since old W took over, it just seems like this website has been continually getting
453540	455720	more and more corporate.
455720	460600	And I'm not going to sit here and say that's necessarily a 100% bad thing.
460600	463800	It sure is a good thing from YouTube's perspective.
463800	469360	Especially for them, hedging all these business relationships with dependent dying media industries
469360	472360	is certainly going to help them stick around in the long run.
472360	476300	So from a strictly business perspective, it makes perfect sense for them.
476300	481600	But at the same time, I can't help but wonder just how disconnected the higher ups at YouTube
481600	483880	are from their core audience.
483880	490300	People on YouTube don't want to watch the NBC Nightly News with Lester Holt.
490300	492560	People on YouTube want to follow personalities.
492560	497520	They don't want to follow some corporate puppet that's been put in his position by
497520	499720	an industry think tank.
499720	504060	And once again, you can prove that idea by just looking at the views.
504060	507960	YouTube audiences don't care about the legacy media.
507960	512320	And YouTube ramming them down our throats certainly isn't going to change that.
512320	516320	As a matter of fact, it'll probably make us like them less.
516320	521000	And strictly speaking from the perspective of a YouTube viewer, you're damn right I'm
521000	527280	going to choose an independent YouTube news personality over a mainstream media corporation.
527280	533160	Why would I side with an entity who has time and time again been proven to be a bunch of
533160	539240	liars, hypocrites, and scam artists who want to do nothing more than push an agenda and
539240	542760	conform to corporate interests?
542760	549700	I don't care how fair and accurate they claim to be.
549700	554540	If I'm going to be getting opinion-based news, I might as well get it from the independent
554540	558460	YouTuber who's not in the pocket of a massive corporation.
558460	562500	So yeah, you're damn right I'm going to choose the guy who can actually speak freely
562500	563960	about issues.
563960	568660	But now in order to protect their investment, YouTube is probably going to downplay all
568660	571540	of those channels, which is a damn shame.
571540	573220	They'll call them fake news.
573220	576380	They'll call them conspiracy theorists.
576380	580140	They'll call them racist, alt-right, radical, whatever.
580140	585540	And meanwhile, at the same time that they'll slander all of their honest, independent,
585540	591180	free-thinking YouTubers, they'll turn around and shove the corrupt mainstream media right
591180	592380	down your throat.
592380	596340	And obviously, like I said, it's not going to make us like them anymore.
596340	602580	But as far as YouTube's concerned, that $25 million investment is worth every penny to
602580	608220	make sure that the mainstream media doesn't really talk about YouTube's problems anymore.
608220	610860	So that's what's going on in YouTube right now.
610860	613500	Feel free to care about it, or don't.
613500	615500	This is the end of the video.
615500	616500	Goodbye!
617500	618500	What the hell is this?
618500	622500	Austin face-to-face with McMahon!
622500	624500	They're shaking hands!
624500	626500	Don't call his shaking hands!
626500	628500	We're saving himself!
628500	633500	For the love of God, someone tell me this is not happening!
633500	635500	It's happening!
635500	641500	Stone Cold Steve Austin has sold his soul for the WWS title!
