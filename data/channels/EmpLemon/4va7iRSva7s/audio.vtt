00:00.000 --> 00:07.000
Hello everyone, it's your favorite YouTube guy

00:07.000 --> 00:09.000
YO PURR LEMON

00:09.000 --> 00:13.000
And today, I am here to explain why I left

00:13.000 --> 00:15.000
Buzzfeed

00:15.000 --> 00:17.000
Abracadabra fatnuts!

00:17.000 --> 00:20.000
It's me, the mayor of Meme Town

00:20.000 --> 00:23.000
The Duke of the Downward Spiral

00:23.000 --> 00:28.000
It's your morally questionable, factually questionable boy, Emperor Lemon

00:28.000 --> 00:32.000
And I am here with yet another update video that no one will watch

00:32.000 --> 00:34.000
Actually, I'm not so sure about that

00:34.000 --> 00:37.000
Because last summer I did one and nobody watched it

00:37.000 --> 00:39.000
But as you guys are probably aware

00:39.000 --> 00:42.000
A lot has changed since last summer

00:42.000 --> 00:45.000
A lot has changed about this YouTube channel

00:45.000 --> 00:47.000
And a lot has changed about the world

00:47.000 --> 00:49.000
But let's start with the obvious

00:49.000 --> 00:52.000
The year is 2017

00:52.000 --> 00:55.000
We are in year 7 of this YouTube channel

00:55.000 --> 00:58.000
Lucky 7, because this is 2017

00:58.000 --> 01:00.000
This is my time

01:00.000 --> 01:06.000
This is year 2 of the never ending Emperor Lemon Downward Spiral World Tour

01:06.000 --> 01:11.000
And this year I uploaded 2 videos

01:11.000 --> 01:16.000
That will forever change the status of this once anemic YouTube channel

01:16.000 --> 01:23.000
You see, last summer I began the era of my YouTube life cycle that you all know as the downward spiral

01:23.000 --> 01:27.000
And every step of the way I faced resistance, backlash, and naysayers

01:27.000 --> 01:30.000
Everyone thought they knew what was good for my channel

01:30.000 --> 01:32.000
Nobody understood the downward spiral

01:32.000 --> 01:34.000
And everybody questioned it

01:34.000 --> 01:35.000
You all questioned me

01:35.000 --> 01:37.000
You all questioned my motives

01:37.000 --> 01:38.000
You all questioned my goals

01:38.000 --> 01:42.000
But most importantly, you questioned why the Simpsons were green

01:42.000 --> 01:45.000
All I wanted to do was make green Simpsons videos

01:45.000 --> 01:47.000
But you people had to ruin it by complaining

01:47.000 --> 01:48.000
So you know what?

01:48.000 --> 01:50.000
Now I've become the one who complains

01:50.000 --> 01:52.000
I complain here, I complain there

01:52.000 --> 01:53.000
I complain everywhere

01:53.000 --> 01:55.000
All I ever do is complain

01:55.000 --> 01:58.000
I complain about frying Dory and you complain back

01:58.000 --> 01:59.000
So I complained even harder

01:59.000 --> 02:01.000
And now frying Dory is an afterthought

02:01.000 --> 02:03.000
Just as it should have been all along

02:03.000 --> 02:04.000
And it's funny to me

02:04.000 --> 02:06.000
Because you all considered me an afterthought

02:06.000 --> 02:07.000
You all wrote me off

02:07.000 --> 02:09.000
You all left this channel for dead

02:09.000 --> 02:11.000
You put me on the downward spiral

02:11.000 --> 02:12.000
So you know what I did?

02:12.000 --> 02:13.000
I wrote that shit

02:13.000 --> 02:16.000
I took the ball you people gave me and fucking ran with it

02:16.000 --> 02:18.000
Because when you're in a downward spiral

02:18.000 --> 02:19.000
There's no escaping it

02:19.000 --> 02:21.000
So you might as well aim for the bottom

02:21.000 --> 02:22.000
And guess what?

02:22.000 --> 02:24.000
If you do it right, you just might end up on top

02:24.000 --> 02:25.000
So that's what I did

02:25.000 --> 02:26.000
And guess what?

02:26.000 --> 02:30.000
The downward spiral brought me directly to the most successful period

02:30.000 --> 02:32.000
In the history of this YouTube channel

02:32.000 --> 02:35.000
You see, the downward spiral is not a bad thing

02:35.000 --> 02:36.000
It's not a problem

02:36.000 --> 02:37.000
It never was

02:37.000 --> 02:40.000
The downward spiral is not an infection

02:40.000 --> 02:41.000
It's the cure

02:41.000 --> 02:44.000
The downward spiral is a metamorphosis

02:44.000 --> 02:46.000
And much like the humble caterpillar

02:46.000 --> 02:50.000
I too entered my transformation as a weak, callow larva

02:50.000 --> 02:53.000
Powerless to the will of my surrounding universe

02:53.000 --> 02:55.000
And just like the caterpillar's chrysalis

02:55.000 --> 02:59.000
I abandoned everything I once presumed about my being

02:59.000 --> 03:03.000
And surrendered myself to the mysterious powers of nature and instinct

03:03.000 --> 03:04.000
Some may call it magic

03:04.000 --> 03:08.000
Others call it the pure manifestation of one's DNA

03:08.000 --> 03:13.000
The unalienable directive of life to not only survive, but thrive

03:13.000 --> 03:15.000
I myself don't understand the true odds and ends of it

03:16.000 --> 03:20.000
But what I do know is that when the downward spiral spat me out on the other side

03:20.000 --> 03:23.000
I emerged more powerful than ever before

03:23.000 --> 03:24.000
A true monarch

03:24.000 --> 03:26.000
Much like the insect bearing the same title

03:26.000 --> 03:28.000
I too had gained flight

03:28.000 --> 03:29.000
I was now free

03:29.000 --> 03:32.000
Free from the dominion of my so-called fans

03:32.000 --> 03:36.000
Free from the authority imposed by the higher powers of this website

03:36.000 --> 03:38.000
And it turns out I always had been

03:38.000 --> 03:43.000
But I allowed myself to become deluded by fear, insecurity, and inexperience

03:43.000 --> 03:48.000
These factors constrained me and chained me to the illusion that my actions were out of my control

03:48.000 --> 03:53.000
However, it was the downward spiral that served as my path towards enlightenment

03:53.000 --> 03:55.000
First I was lost

03:55.000 --> 03:57.000
But now I'm found

03:57.000 --> 03:58.000
And the chains

03:58.000 --> 04:00.000
The chains are off, man!

04:00.000 --> 04:03.000
The chains are off!

04:03.000 --> 04:05.000
I am the one in control now

04:05.000 --> 04:08.000
Me! You people don't have power over me anymore

04:08.000 --> 04:11.000
YouTube doesn't have power over me anymore

04:11.000 --> 04:17.000
I have grasped the reigns of this channel and I've led it to the greenest pastures it's ever seen

04:17.000 --> 04:19.000
And sure, it hasn't been the smoothest ride

04:19.000 --> 04:21.000
I've scorched the earth around me

04:21.000 --> 04:23.000
I've become hated by a ton of people

04:23.000 --> 04:26.000
But that's the price I'm willing to pay for true creative freedom

04:26.000 --> 04:29.000
That's the price I'm willing to pay for unconditional respect

04:29.000 --> 04:31.000
And you can hate me all you want from now on

04:31.000 --> 04:32.000
You really can

04:32.000 --> 04:33.000
It won't make a difference

04:33.000 --> 04:39.000
I have ascended to a level on this website that few others have before me

04:39.000 --> 04:41.000
I scream at people to unsubscribe

04:41.000 --> 04:43.000
And people subscribe more than ever

04:43.000 --> 04:50.000
I force memes so far down people's throats that I give them an opposite direction prostate exam

04:50.000 --> 04:54.000
I then scoop up the shit-covered, shit-tier shitpost memes

04:54.000 --> 04:57.000
Put them on a cheap t-shirt and sell it back to them for money

04:57.000 --> 05:04.000
And in an age where YouTube is forcing everyone to neuter their content into kid-friendly preschool playtime for babies

05:04.000 --> 05:09.000
I've made my content more vulgar, more repugnant, and more despicable than it's ever been

05:09.000 --> 05:11.000
And you wanna know why I do this?

05:11.000 --> 05:14.000
You wanna know why I give as little of a shit as I do?

05:14.000 --> 05:17.000
It's because YouTube is not my job

05:17.000 --> 05:19.000
And I don't mean that I don't make money

05:19.000 --> 05:21.000
I certainly do plenty of that

05:21.000 --> 05:22.000
I like money

05:22.000 --> 05:24.000
I like being able to afford things

05:24.000 --> 05:27.000
I earn money from YouTube but it's not my job

05:27.000 --> 05:31.000
It's a part-time hobby meant for fun that I just so happen to get paid for

05:31.000 --> 05:37.000
What I'm saying is that making money on YouTube is not, and has never been, my primary goal

05:37.000 --> 05:40.000
My primary goal has always been to make content that I like

05:40.000 --> 05:43.000
So it doesn't fucking matter if you don't like it

05:43.000 --> 05:45.000
Or you disagree with it

05:45.000 --> 05:47.000
Whatever, boohoo, too bad, so sad

05:47.000 --> 05:49.000
I don't answer to you

05:49.000 --> 05:51.000
YouTube is not my job

05:51.000 --> 05:52.000
And you aren't my boss

05:52.000 --> 05:54.000
I am my boss

05:54.000 --> 05:56.000
I decide what I want to make

05:56.000 --> 05:57.000
Not you, me

05:57.000 --> 05:59.000
And you know what I wanna make?

05:59.000 --> 06:01.000
More fucking Green Simpsons videos

06:01.000 --> 06:03.000
Because that's what this is all about

06:03.000 --> 06:05.000
I started YouTube drama, I worked the system

06:05.000 --> 06:10.000
I put in all this effort and won all these people over just so I could get them to watch Green Simpsons

06:10.000 --> 06:12.000
Welcome to the greenest years of our adventures

06:12.000 --> 06:15.000
So stay tuned for more Green Simpsons

06:15.000 --> 06:16.000
And shitposts

06:16.000 --> 06:17.000
And ear rape

06:17.000 --> 06:18.000
And forced memes

06:18.000 --> 06:19.000
And complaining

06:19.000 --> 06:21.000
And more meme theory too

06:21.000 --> 06:23.000
But this time it won't have to do with YouTube drama

06:23.000 --> 06:24.000
Just memes

06:24.000 --> 06:25.000
And theorizing

06:25.000 --> 06:27.000
And shitting on normies

06:27.000 --> 06:29.000
And using the word memescape

06:29.000 --> 06:31.000
Okay, maybe it's gonna be just as bad as YouTube drama

06:31.000 --> 06:33.000
But I don't give a fuck

06:33.000 --> 06:36.000
Normies will just get mad and feed me even more ad revenue

06:36.000 --> 06:38.000
Welcome to the greenest years of our adventures

06:38.000 --> 06:39.000
You know what? Scratch that

06:39.000 --> 06:41.000
I'm not even gonna make videos

06:41.000 --> 06:44.000
This whole time I've just been designing a new t-shirt instead of editing

06:44.000 --> 06:45.000
So yeah

06:45.000 --> 06:46.000
New t-shirt

06:46.000 --> 06:48.000
Featuring your new favorite Emperor Lemon meme

06:48.000 --> 06:50.000
Enough is enough

06:50.000 --> 06:52.000
And if you think this is the end of the downward spiral

06:52.000 --> 06:53.000
Well, I've got news for you, buddy

06:53.000 --> 06:55.000
That shirt's still there too

06:55.000 --> 06:56.000
As a matter of fact

06:56.000 --> 06:58.000
The downward spiral shirt will always be on sale

06:58.000 --> 07:00.000
As a permanent symbol

07:00.000 --> 07:01.000
Of the never-ending

07:01.000 --> 07:02.000
Emperor Lemon

07:02.000 --> 07:04.000
Downward spiral world tour

07:04.000 --> 07:05.000
So go ahead

07:05.000 --> 07:06.000
Buy a shirt

07:06.000 --> 07:08.000
I guarantee you'll be disappointed

07:08.000 --> 07:09.000
Thanks for the money though

07:09.000 --> 07:10.000
And hey

07:10.000 --> 07:12.000
If you wanna give me your money and get nothing in return

07:12.000 --> 07:14.000
I have a Patreon

07:14.000 --> 07:15.000
Let's see, what else?

07:15.000 --> 07:17.000
I also have a subreddit that I barely post on

07:17.000 --> 07:18.000
Oh yeah, and

07:18.000 --> 07:20.000
I'm also opening up a Discord channel

07:20.000 --> 07:22.000
Because that's something all the pro

07:22.000 --> 07:24.000
Two school for cool YouTubers are doing

07:24.000 --> 07:25.000
Woo wee

07:25.000 --> 07:28.000
Look at this big time big ticket YouTuber

07:28.000 --> 07:30.000
With a Discord channel and subreddit

07:30.000 --> 07:33.000
Wow, I'm sure he must be in the big time

07:33.000 --> 07:35.000
Playing John Madden big time football

07:35.000 --> 07:37.000
Big muscle, big biceps

07:37.000 --> 07:40.000
Mega ultra super duper beef supreme gordita

07:40.000 --> 07:41.000
And

07:41.000 --> 07:45.000
Have 200,000 people really subscribed to this shit?

07:45.000 --> 07:47.000
But you wanna know what I really wanna know?

07:47.000 --> 07:51.000
Do you wanna know the real deep itching burning question here?

07:51.000 --> 07:53.000
Will anyone actually watch this update video?

07:54.000 --> 07:57.000
Anyway, that's why I left Team 10

07:57.000 --> 07:59.000
Jake Paul is a foot

08:01.000 --> 08:03.000
So tune in next time

08:03.000 --> 08:05.000

08:05.000 --> 08:06.000
