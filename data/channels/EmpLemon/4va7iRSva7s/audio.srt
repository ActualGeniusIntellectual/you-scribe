00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Hello everyone, it's your favorite YouTube guy

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,000
YO PURR LEMON

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:13,000
And today, I am here to explain why I left

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Buzzfeed

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Abracadabra fatnuts!

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,000
It's me, the mayor of Meme Town

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,000
The Duke of the Downward Spiral

8
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:28,000
It's your morally questionable, factually questionable boy, Emperor Lemon

9
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,000
And I am here with yet another update video that no one will watch

10
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Actually, I'm not so sure about that

11
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Because last summer I did one and nobody watched it

12
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
But as you guys are probably aware

13
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,000
A lot has changed since last summer

14
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,000
A lot has changed about this YouTube channel

15
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
And a lot has changed about the world

16
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
But let's start with the obvious

17
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
The year is 2017

18
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,000
We are in year 7 of this YouTube channel

19
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Lucky 7, because this is 2017

20
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
This is my time

21
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:06,000
This is year 2 of the never ending Emperor Lemon Downward Spiral World Tour

22
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:11,000
And this year I uploaded 2 videos

23
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:16,000
That will forever change the status of this once anemic YouTube channel

24
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:23,000
You see, last summer I began the era of my YouTube life cycle that you all know as the downward spiral

25
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:27,000
And every step of the way I faced resistance, backlash, and naysayers

26
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Everyone thought they knew what was good for my channel

27
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Nobody understood the downward spiral

28
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
And everybody questioned it

29
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,000
You all questioned me

30
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
You all questioned my motives

31
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,000
You all questioned my goals

32
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:42,000
But most importantly, you questioned why the Simpsons were green

33
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,000
All I wanted to do was make green Simpsons videos

34
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
But you people had to ruin it by complaining

35
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,000
So you know what?

36
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Now I've become the one who complains

37
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
I complain here, I complain there

38
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,000
I complain everywhere

39
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
All I ever do is complain

40
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,000
I complain about frying Dory and you complain back

41
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
So I complained even harder

42
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
And now frying Dory is an afterthought

43
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Just as it should have been all along

44
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,000
And it's funny to me

45
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Because you all considered me an afterthought

46
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,000
You all wrote me off

47
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
You all left this channel for dead

48
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
You put me on the downward spiral

49
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,000
So you know what I did?

50
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
I wrote that shit

51
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,000
I took the ball you people gave me and fucking ran with it

52
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Because when you're in a downward spiral

53
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
There's no escaping it

54
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
So you might as well aim for the bottom

55
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
And guess what?

56
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
If you do it right, you just might end up on top

57
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
So that's what I did

58
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
And guess what?

59
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:30,000
The downward spiral brought me directly to the most successful period

60
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
In the history of this YouTube channel

61
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:35,000
You see, the downward spiral is not a bad thing

62
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
It's not a problem

63
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,000
It never was

64
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:40,000
The downward spiral is not an infection

65
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
It's the cure

66
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:44,000
The downward spiral is a metamorphosis

67
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
And much like the humble caterpillar

68
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:50,000
I too entered my transformation as a weak, callow larva

69
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Powerless to the will of my surrounding universe

70
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
And just like the caterpillar's chrysalis

71
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:59,000
I abandoned everything I once presumed about my being

72
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:03,000
And surrendered myself to the mysterious powers of nature and instinct

73
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Some may call it magic

74
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Others call it the pure manifestation of one's DNA

75
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:13,000
The unalienable directive of life to not only survive, but thrive

76
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
I myself don't understand the true odds and ends of it

77
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:20,000
But what I do know is that when the downward spiral spat me out on the other side

78
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,000
I emerged more powerful than ever before

79
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
A true monarch

80
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Much like the insect bearing the same title

81
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
I too had gained flight

82
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
I was now free

83
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Free from the dominion of my so-called fans

84
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Free from the authority imposed by the higher powers of this website

85
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
And it turns out I always had been

86
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:43,000
But I allowed myself to become deluded by fear, insecurity, and inexperience

87
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:48,000
These factors constrained me and chained me to the illusion that my actions were out of my control

88
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:53,000
However, it was the downward spiral that served as my path towards enlightenment

89
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
First I was lost

90
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
But now I'm found

91
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
And the chains

92
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
The chains are off, man!

93
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,000
The chains are off!

94
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
I am the one in control now

95
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Me! You people don't have power over me anymore

96
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,000
YouTube doesn't have power over me anymore

97
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:17,000
I have grasped the reigns of this channel and I've led it to the greenest pastures it's ever seen

98
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
And sure, it hasn't been the smoothest ride

99
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
I've scorched the earth around me

100
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
I've become hated by a ton of people

101
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:26,000
But that's the price I'm willing to pay for true creative freedom

102
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,000
That's the price I'm willing to pay for unconditional respect

103
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
And you can hate me all you want from now on

104
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
You really can

105
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
It won't make a difference

106
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:39,000
I have ascended to a level on this website that few others have before me

107
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
I scream at people to unsubscribe

108
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
And people subscribe more than ever

109
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:50,000
I force memes so far down people's throats that I give them an opposite direction prostate exam

110
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:54,000
I then scoop up the shit-covered, shit-tier shitpost memes

111
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Put them on a cheap t-shirt and sell it back to them for money

112
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:04,000
And in an age where YouTube is forcing everyone to neuter their content into kid-friendly preschool playtime for babies

113
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:09,000
I've made my content more vulgar, more repugnant, and more despicable than it's ever been

114
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
And you wanna know why I do this?

115
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:14,000
You wanna know why I give as little of a shit as I do?

116
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,000
It's because YouTube is not my job

117
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
And I don't mean that I don't make money

118
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
I certainly do plenty of that

119
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
I like money

120
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
I like being able to afford things

121
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,000
I earn money from YouTube but it's not my job

122
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:31,000
It's a part-time hobby meant for fun that I just so happen to get paid for

123
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:37,000
What I'm saying is that making money on YouTube is not, and has never been, my primary goal

124
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:40,000
My primary goal has always been to make content that I like

125
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:43,000
So it doesn't fucking matter if you don't like it

126
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Or you disagree with it

127
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Whatever, boohoo, too bad, so sad

128
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
I don't answer to you

129
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
YouTube is not my job

130
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
And you aren't my boss

131
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
I am my boss

132
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
I decide what I want to make

133
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Not you, me

134
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
And you know what I wanna make?

135
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
More fucking Green Simpsons videos

136
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Because that's what this is all about

137
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
I started YouTube drama, I worked the system

138
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:10,000
I put in all this effort and won all these people over just so I could get them to watch Green Simpsons

139
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Welcome to the greenest years of our adventures

140
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,000
So stay tuned for more Green Simpsons

141
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
And shitposts

142
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
And ear rape

143
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
And forced memes

144
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
And complaining

145
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
And more meme theory too

146
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
But this time it won't have to do with YouTube drama

147
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Just memes

148
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
And theorizing

149
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
And shitting on normies

150
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
And using the word memescape

151
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Okay, maybe it's gonna be just as bad as YouTube drama

152
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
But I don't give a fuck

153
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Normies will just get mad and feed me even more ad revenue

154
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Welcome to the greenest years of our adventures

155
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
You know what? Scratch that

156
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
I'm not even gonna make videos

157
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:44,000
This whole time I've just been designing a new t-shirt instead of editing

158
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
So yeah

159
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
New t-shirt

160
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Featuring your new favorite Emperor Lemon meme

161
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Enough is enough

162
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
And if you think this is the end of the downward spiral

163
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Well, I've got news for you, buddy

164
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
That shirt's still there too

165
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
As a matter of fact

166
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
The downward spiral shirt will always be on sale

167
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
As a permanent symbol

168
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Of the never-ending

169
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Emperor Lemon

170
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Downward spiral world tour

171
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
So go ahead

172
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Buy a shirt

173
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
I guarantee you'll be disappointed

174
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Thanks for the money though

175
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
And hey

176
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
If you wanna give me your money and get nothing in return

177
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
I have a Patreon

178
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Let's see, what else?

179
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
I also have a subreddit that I barely post on

180
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Oh yeah, and

181
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
I'm also opening up a Discord channel
