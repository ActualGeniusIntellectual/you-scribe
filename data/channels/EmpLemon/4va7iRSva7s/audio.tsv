0	7000	Hello everyone, it's your favorite YouTube guy
7000	9000	YO PURR LEMON
9000	13000	And today, I am here to explain why I left
13000	15000	Buzzfeed
15000	17000	Abracadabra fatnuts!
17000	20000	It's me, the mayor of Meme Town
20000	23000	The Duke of the Downward Spiral
23000	28000	It's your morally questionable, factually questionable boy, Emperor Lemon
28000	32000	And I am here with yet another update video that no one will watch
32000	34000	Actually, I'm not so sure about that
34000	37000	Because last summer I did one and nobody watched it
37000	39000	But as you guys are probably aware
39000	42000	A lot has changed since last summer
42000	45000	A lot has changed about this YouTube channel
45000	47000	And a lot has changed about the world
47000	49000	But let's start with the obvious
49000	52000	The year is 2017
52000	55000	We are in year 7 of this YouTube channel
55000	58000	Lucky 7, because this is 2017
58000	60000	This is my time
60000	66000	This is year 2 of the never ending Emperor Lemon Downward Spiral World Tour
66000	71000	And this year I uploaded 2 videos
71000	76000	That will forever change the status of this once anemic YouTube channel
76000	83000	You see, last summer I began the era of my YouTube life cycle that you all know as the downward spiral
83000	87000	And every step of the way I faced resistance, backlash, and naysayers
87000	90000	Everyone thought they knew what was good for my channel
90000	92000	Nobody understood the downward spiral
92000	94000	And everybody questioned it
94000	95000	You all questioned me
95000	97000	You all questioned my motives
97000	98000	You all questioned my goals
98000	102000	But most importantly, you questioned why the Simpsons were green
102000	105000	All I wanted to do was make green Simpsons videos
105000	107000	But you people had to ruin it by complaining
107000	108000	So you know what?
108000	110000	Now I've become the one who complains
110000	112000	I complain here, I complain there
112000	113000	I complain everywhere
113000	115000	All I ever do is complain
115000	118000	I complain about frying Dory and you complain back
118000	119000	So I complained even harder
119000	121000	And now frying Dory is an afterthought
121000	123000	Just as it should have been all along
123000	124000	And it's funny to me
124000	126000	Because you all considered me an afterthought
126000	127000	You all wrote me off
127000	129000	You all left this channel for dead
129000	131000	You put me on the downward spiral
131000	132000	So you know what I did?
132000	133000	I wrote that shit
133000	136000	I took the ball you people gave me and fucking ran with it
136000	138000	Because when you're in a downward spiral
138000	139000	There's no escaping it
139000	141000	So you might as well aim for the bottom
141000	142000	And guess what?
142000	144000	If you do it right, you just might end up on top
144000	145000	So that's what I did
145000	146000	And guess what?
146000	150000	The downward spiral brought me directly to the most successful period
150000	152000	In the history of this YouTube channel
152000	155000	You see, the downward spiral is not a bad thing
155000	156000	It's not a problem
156000	157000	It never was
157000	160000	The downward spiral is not an infection
160000	161000	It's the cure
161000	164000	The downward spiral is a metamorphosis
164000	166000	And much like the humble caterpillar
166000	170000	I too entered my transformation as a weak, callow larva
170000	173000	Powerless to the will of my surrounding universe
173000	175000	And just like the caterpillar's chrysalis
175000	179000	I abandoned everything I once presumed about my being
179000	183000	And surrendered myself to the mysterious powers of nature and instinct
183000	184000	Some may call it magic
184000	188000	Others call it the pure manifestation of one's DNA
188000	193000	The unalienable directive of life to not only survive, but thrive
193000	195000	I myself don't understand the true odds and ends of it
196000	200000	But what I do know is that when the downward spiral spat me out on the other side
200000	203000	I emerged more powerful than ever before
203000	204000	A true monarch
204000	206000	Much like the insect bearing the same title
206000	208000	I too had gained flight
208000	209000	I was now free
209000	212000	Free from the dominion of my so-called fans
212000	216000	Free from the authority imposed by the higher powers of this website
216000	218000	And it turns out I always had been
218000	223000	But I allowed myself to become deluded by fear, insecurity, and inexperience
223000	228000	These factors constrained me and chained me to the illusion that my actions were out of my control
228000	233000	However, it was the downward spiral that served as my path towards enlightenment
233000	235000	First I was lost
235000	237000	But now I'm found
237000	238000	And the chains
238000	240000	The chains are off, man!
240000	243000	The chains are off!
243000	245000	I am the one in control now
245000	248000	Me! You people don't have power over me anymore
248000	251000	YouTube doesn't have power over me anymore
251000	257000	I have grasped the reigns of this channel and I've led it to the greenest pastures it's ever seen
257000	259000	And sure, it hasn't been the smoothest ride
259000	261000	I've scorched the earth around me
261000	263000	I've become hated by a ton of people
263000	266000	But that's the price I'm willing to pay for true creative freedom
266000	269000	That's the price I'm willing to pay for unconditional respect
269000	271000	And you can hate me all you want from now on
271000	272000	You really can
272000	273000	It won't make a difference
273000	279000	I have ascended to a level on this website that few others have before me
279000	281000	I scream at people to unsubscribe
281000	283000	And people subscribe more than ever
283000	290000	I force memes so far down people's throats that I give them an opposite direction prostate exam
290000	294000	I then scoop up the shit-covered, shit-tier shitpost memes
294000	297000	Put them on a cheap t-shirt and sell it back to them for money
297000	304000	And in an age where YouTube is forcing everyone to neuter their content into kid-friendly preschool playtime for babies
304000	309000	I've made my content more vulgar, more repugnant, and more despicable than it's ever been
309000	311000	And you wanna know why I do this?
311000	314000	You wanna know why I give as little of a shit as I do?
314000	317000	It's because YouTube is not my job
317000	319000	And I don't mean that I don't make money
319000	321000	I certainly do plenty of that
321000	322000	I like money
322000	324000	I like being able to afford things
324000	327000	I earn money from YouTube but it's not my job
327000	331000	It's a part-time hobby meant for fun that I just so happen to get paid for
331000	337000	What I'm saying is that making money on YouTube is not, and has never been, my primary goal
337000	340000	My primary goal has always been to make content that I like
340000	343000	So it doesn't fucking matter if you don't like it
343000	345000	Or you disagree with it
345000	347000	Whatever, boohoo, too bad, so sad
347000	349000	I don't answer to you
349000	351000	YouTube is not my job
351000	352000	And you aren't my boss
352000	354000	I am my boss
354000	356000	I decide what I want to make
356000	357000	Not you, me
357000	359000	And you know what I wanna make?
359000	361000	More fucking Green Simpsons videos
361000	363000	Because that's what this is all about
363000	365000	I started YouTube drama, I worked the system
365000	370000	I put in all this effort and won all these people over just so I could get them to watch Green Simpsons
370000	372000	Welcome to the greenest years of our adventures
372000	375000	So stay tuned for more Green Simpsons
375000	376000	And shitposts
376000	377000	And ear rape
377000	378000	And forced memes
378000	379000	And complaining
379000	381000	And more meme theory too
381000	383000	But this time it won't have to do with YouTube drama
383000	384000	Just memes
384000	385000	And theorizing
385000	387000	And shitting on normies
387000	389000	And using the word memescape
389000	391000	Okay, maybe it's gonna be just as bad as YouTube drama
391000	393000	But I don't give a fuck
393000	396000	Normies will just get mad and feed me even more ad revenue
396000	398000	Welcome to the greenest years of our adventures
398000	399000	You know what? Scratch that
399000	401000	I'm not even gonna make videos
401000	404000	This whole time I've just been designing a new t-shirt instead of editing
404000	405000	So yeah
405000	406000	New t-shirt
406000	408000	Featuring your new favorite Emperor Lemon meme
408000	410000	Enough is enough
410000	412000	And if you think this is the end of the downward spiral
412000	413000	Well, I've got news for you, buddy
413000	415000	That shirt's still there too
415000	416000	As a matter of fact
416000	418000	The downward spiral shirt will always be on sale
418000	420000	As a permanent symbol
420000	421000	Of the never-ending
