00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,560
You know, recently I feel like there's been a lot of tension between me and this website.

2
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:07,680
I'm just sensing a lot of conflict here, you know?

3
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:11,600
And I feel like it's creating a very angry and hateful environment.

4
00:00:11,600 --> 00:00:13,680
And no one likes that, right?

5
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:16,240
I just have so much anger built up, you know?

6
00:00:16,240 --> 00:00:19,440
With all the censorship and the demonetization

7
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:21,280
and the funding pedophiles

8
00:00:21,280 --> 00:00:24,160
and the 2017 memes sucking complete dick.

9
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:26,720
It's all got me a little on edge.

10
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:28,480
I'm just so confused.

11
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:30,240
YouTube is so unstable.

12
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:32,320
YouTubers have no idea what's going on.

13
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:36,400
And I'm pretty sure YouTube has no idea what's going on.

14
00:00:36,400 --> 00:00:40,080
The CEO of YouTube doesn't even know how to make a YouTube video.

15
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:42,240
I just don't understand what's going on anymore.

16
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:46,000
Why are washed up Disney Channel stars the face of this website again?

17
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,760
Nothing makes any sense.

18
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:49,520
I just have so many questions.

19
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:51,760
All I want are some answers.

20
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:54,320
All I need is some guidance.

21
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:56,800
And that's when I found it.

22
00:00:56,800 --> 00:01:01,200
For on this momentous day, I was visited by a wise monk

23
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:04,720
by the name of YoloGuy929 the tooth.

24
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:10,160
At DankMeme929, this agent of divine intervention

25
00:01:10,160 --> 00:01:15,200
provided me with the greatest epiphany of my YouTube career.

26
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:23,120
YoloGuy929 enlightened me to the almighty YouTube prophet, Montazon.

27
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:26,720
Now normally, I'm not a very spiritual person.

28
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:28,880
But that's just because I was blinded.

29
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:32,320
Blinded by greed and selfishness.

30
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:39,680
I was blind to Montazon's eternal and undying love for all of his children.

31
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:42,000
The children of YouTube.

32
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:45,840
If you look back through history, Montazon appears everywhere.

33
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:50,320
He is an omniscient and omnipresent being.

34
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:54,960
He transcends time and petty human conflict.

35
00:01:54,960 --> 00:02:00,000
If you upload a video to YouTube, Montazon is watching.

36
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,400
Because Montazon loves you.

37
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:04,560
Now I know what you're thinking.

38
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:08,160
Montazon demonetizes and censors YouTubers.

39
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:09,680
So how can he love us?

40
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:16,240
Well allow me to deliver you all a sermon from the book of Montazon.

41
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:23,200
In the beginning, there were only four YouTubers.

42
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:29,120
Ellen DeGeneres provided us with hilarious funny comedy epic memes.

43
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:34,720
As she is a hilarious and funny female LGBT comedian.

44
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:42,720
The Rock provided us with incredible acting and thrilling motion picture cinematic action adventures.

45
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:46,960
Jimmy Kimmel made us all learn the powerful lesson

46
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:53,040
that all the world's problems are the fault of us weak and pathetic peasants.

47
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:58,320
And he reminds us that celebrities are strong,

48
00:02:58,320 --> 00:03:04,080
brave and will solve all the world's problems by being a celebrity.

49
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:11,840
And finally, Taylor Swift Vivo provided us with the soundtrack of our lives

50
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:15,360
through her innovative and groundbreaking music

51
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:20,400
that has surpassed the quality of the greatest musicians in human history.

52
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:26,320
These four original YouTubers lived together in harmony.

53
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:32,880
Then everything changed when the evil, racist, sexist, homophobic, transphobic,

54
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:38,480
racist, fascist, racist, racist, racist, evil, racist video gamers attacked.

55
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:45,440
Led by their leader, PewDiePie, the gamers tried to destroy the harmony of YouTube

56
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:49,920
by being racist, sexist, homophobic, evil, racist, sexist, racist, racist.

57
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:54,000
Video games, evil, racist video games.

58
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:56,560
Racism is bad.

59
00:03:56,560 --> 00:04:01,680
Racism was going to evilly destroy YouTube.

60
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:06,160
Who was brave enough to save Ellen DeGeneres, The Rock,

61
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:12,000
Jimmy Kimmel and Taylor Swift Vivo from the racist, sexist, homophobic,

62
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:16,400
transphobic, racist, racist, racist, racist, racist video gamers.

63
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:21,120
Then just when the racist video gamers were about to complete their plan

64
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:27,760
and turn YouTube into racist tube, Montazon sacrificed himself to save YouTube.

65
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:32,160
Montazon died for our racist sins.

66
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:41,920
Montazon made the greatest sacrifice of all because Montazon loves you and Montazon loves YouTube.

67
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:50,480
Montazon gave up his physical form so he can watch over all of us and protect us from evil racism.

68
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:53,680
Montazon made the greatest sacrifice of all.

69
00:04:53,680 --> 00:05:00,000
So is it too much to ask for you to sacrifice a little bit of your ad revenue to Montazon?

70
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,040
I think not.

71
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:07,840
Every time your video gets demonetized, that is just Montazon protecting you from evil racists.

72
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:15,120
Montazon is gifting you with his protective touch and you should be grateful for his sacrifice.

73
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:21,360
That yellow dollar sign is just a sign that Montazon is watching over you

74
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:24,640
and keeping you safe from racism.

75
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:28,160
So don't get mad at YouTube anymore.

76
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:35,440
Instead, be thankful that Montazon sacrificed himself so that YouTube can exist at all.

77
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:41,200
So take this holiday season and give thanks to Montazon.

78
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:48,880
And always remember, Montazon is watching and Montazon loves you.
