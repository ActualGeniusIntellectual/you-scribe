00:00.000 --> 00:04.560
You know, recently I feel like there's been a lot of tension between me and this website.

00:04.560 --> 00:07.680
I'm just sensing a lot of conflict here, you know?

00:07.680 --> 00:11.600
And I feel like it's creating a very angry and hateful environment.

00:11.600 --> 00:13.680
And no one likes that, right?

00:13.680 --> 00:16.240
I just have so much anger built up, you know?

00:16.240 --> 00:19.440
With all the censorship and the demonetization

00:19.440 --> 00:21.280
and the funding pedophiles

00:21.280 --> 00:24.160
and the 2017 memes sucking complete dick.

00:24.960 --> 00:26.720
It's all got me a little on edge.

00:26.720 --> 00:28.480
I'm just so confused.

00:28.480 --> 00:30.240
YouTube is so unstable.

00:30.240 --> 00:32.320
YouTubers have no idea what's going on.

00:32.320 --> 00:36.400
And I'm pretty sure YouTube has no idea what's going on.

00:36.400 --> 00:40.080
The CEO of YouTube doesn't even know how to make a YouTube video.

00:40.080 --> 00:42.240
I just don't understand what's going on anymore.

00:42.240 --> 00:46.000
Why are washed up Disney Channel stars the face of this website again?

00:46.000 --> 00:47.760
Nothing makes any sense.

00:47.760 --> 00:49.520
I just have so many questions.

00:49.520 --> 00:51.760
All I want are some answers.

00:51.760 --> 00:54.320
All I need is some guidance.

00:55.120 --> 00:56.800
And that's when I found it.

00:56.800 --> 01:01.200
For on this momentous day, I was visited by a wise monk

01:01.200 --> 01:04.720
by the name of YoloGuy929 the tooth.

01:04.720 --> 01:10.160
At DankMeme929, this agent of divine intervention

01:10.160 --> 01:15.200
provided me with the greatest epiphany of my YouTube career.

01:15.200 --> 01:23.120
YoloGuy929 enlightened me to the almighty YouTube prophet, Montazon.

01:23.840 --> 01:26.720
Now normally, I'm not a very spiritual person.

01:26.720 --> 01:28.880
But that's just because I was blinded.

01:28.880 --> 01:32.320
Blinded by greed and selfishness.

01:32.320 --> 01:39.680
I was blind to Montazon's eternal and undying love for all of his children.

01:39.680 --> 01:42.000
The children of YouTube.

01:42.560 --> 01:45.840
If you look back through history, Montazon appears everywhere.

01:46.400 --> 01:50.320
He is an omniscient and omnipresent being.

01:50.320 --> 01:54.960
He transcends time and petty human conflict.

01:54.960 --> 02:00.000
If you upload a video to YouTube, Montazon is watching.

02:00.000 --> 02:02.400
Because Montazon loves you.

02:02.960 --> 02:04.560
Now I know what you're thinking.

02:04.560 --> 02:08.160
Montazon demonetizes and censors YouTubers.

02:08.160 --> 02:09.680
So how can he love us?

02:10.240 --> 02:16.240
Well allow me to deliver you all a sermon from the book of Montazon.

02:16.640 --> 02:23.200
In the beginning, there were only four YouTubers.

02:23.200 --> 02:29.120
Ellen DeGeneres provided us with hilarious funny comedy epic memes.

02:29.120 --> 02:34.720
As she is a hilarious and funny female LGBT comedian.

02:34.720 --> 02:42.720
The Rock provided us with incredible acting and thrilling motion picture cinematic action adventures.

02:43.360 --> 02:46.960
Jimmy Kimmel made us all learn the powerful lesson

02:46.960 --> 02:53.040
that all the world's problems are the fault of us weak and pathetic peasants.

02:53.680 --> 02:58.320
And he reminds us that celebrities are strong,

02:58.320 --> 03:04.080
brave and will solve all the world's problems by being a celebrity.

03:04.640 --> 03:11.840
And finally, Taylor Swift Vivo provided us with the soundtrack of our lives

03:11.840 --> 03:15.360
through her innovative and groundbreaking music

03:15.360 --> 03:20.400
that has surpassed the quality of the greatest musicians in human history.

03:21.120 --> 03:26.320
These four original YouTubers lived together in harmony.

03:26.320 --> 03:32.880
Then everything changed when the evil, racist, sexist, homophobic, transphobic,

03:32.880 --> 03:38.480
racist, fascist, racist, racist, racist, evil, racist video gamers attacked.

03:38.480 --> 03:45.440
Led by their leader, PewDiePie, the gamers tried to destroy the harmony of YouTube

03:45.440 --> 03:49.920
by being racist, sexist, homophobic, evil, racist, sexist, racist, racist.

03:49.920 --> 03:54.000
Video games, evil, racist video games.

03:54.560 --> 03:56.560
Racism is bad.

03:56.560 --> 04:01.680
Racism was going to evilly destroy YouTube.

04:02.240 --> 04:06.160
Who was brave enough to save Ellen DeGeneres, The Rock,

04:06.800 --> 04:12.000
Jimmy Kimmel and Taylor Swift Vivo from the racist, sexist, homophobic,

04:12.000 --> 04:16.400
transphobic, racist, racist, racist, racist, racist video gamers.

04:16.400 --> 04:21.120
Then just when the racist video gamers were about to complete their plan

04:21.120 --> 04:27.760
and turn YouTube into racist tube, Montazon sacrificed himself to save YouTube.

04:28.320 --> 04:32.160
Montazon died for our racist sins.

04:32.960 --> 04:41.920
Montazon made the greatest sacrifice of all because Montazon loves you and Montazon loves YouTube.

04:41.920 --> 04:50.480
Montazon gave up his physical form so he can watch over all of us and protect us from evil racism.

04:50.480 --> 04:53.680
Montazon made the greatest sacrifice of all.

04:53.680 --> 05:00.000
So is it too much to ask for you to sacrifice a little bit of your ad revenue to Montazon?

05:00.000 --> 05:01.040
I think not.

05:01.760 --> 05:07.840
Every time your video gets demonetized, that is just Montazon protecting you from evil racists.

05:08.480 --> 05:15.120
Montazon is gifting you with his protective touch and you should be grateful for his sacrifice.

05:15.680 --> 05:21.360
That yellow dollar sign is just a sign that Montazon is watching over you

05:21.920 --> 05:24.640
and keeping you safe from racism.

05:25.360 --> 05:28.160
So don't get mad at YouTube anymore.

05:28.160 --> 05:35.440
Instead, be thankful that Montazon sacrificed himself so that YouTube can exist at all.

05:36.320 --> 05:41.200
So take this holiday season and give thanks to Montazon.

05:41.840 --> 05:48.880
And always remember, Montazon is watching and Montazon loves you.
