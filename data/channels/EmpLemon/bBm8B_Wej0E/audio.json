{"text": " So let's talk about jokes. Ideally, a joke is supposed to be funny. A knock-knock joke may be the worst kind of joke in existence because knock-knock jokes aren't funny. Listening to a knock-knock joke is like watching a high school dance through a telescope. You can see the punch line from a mile away. What you just heard was a pun, which is essentially a knock-knock joke without the foreplay. Alfred Hitchcock once called the pun the highest form of literature. Hitchcock was certainly a genius at filmmaking, but he was really being an idiot when he said that. Puns aren't funny and neither are knock-knock jokes. What is funny, however, is this new underground meme called Grabahan, mostly because it is so unexpected and unpredictable. Who knew that a random city in Indonesia could make such a dynamic and long-lasting meme? Now this meme stayed pretty obscure so far, so there's a good chance that many of you watching this are asking yourselves the same question, what's so funny about Grabahan? And the answer to that is, grab a handful of my nuts!", "segments": [{"id": 0, "seek": 0, "start": 0.0, "end": 14.0, "text": " So let's talk about jokes. Ideally, a joke is supposed to be funny.
