So let's talk about jokes. Ideally, a joke is supposed to be funny. A knock-knock joke may be

00:14.000 --> 00:18.200
the worst kind of joke in existence because knock-knock jokes aren't funny. Listening to

00:18.200 --> 00:22.920
a knock-knock joke is like watching a high school dance through a telescope. You can see the punch

00:22.920 --> 00:27.880
line from a mile away. What you just heard was a pun, which is essentially a knock-knock joke

00:27.920 --> 00:32.500
without the foreplay. Alfred Hitchcock once called the pun the highest form of literature.

00:32.500 --> 00:37.240
Hitchcock was certainly a genius at filmmaking, but he was really being an idiot when he said

00:37.240 --> 00:42.360
that. Puns aren't funny and neither are knock-knock jokes. What is funny, however, is this new

00:42.360 --> 00:48.440
underground meme called Grabahan, mostly because it is so unexpected and unpredictable. Who knew

00:48.440 --> 00:54.040
that a random city in Indonesia could make such a dynamic and long-lasting meme? Now this meme

00:54.040 --> 00:58.600
stayed pretty obscure so far, so there's a good chance that many of you watching this are asking

00:58.600 --> 01:03.200
yourselves the same question, what's so funny about Grabahan? And the answer to that is,

01:03.200 --> 01:05.080
grab a handful of my nuts!
