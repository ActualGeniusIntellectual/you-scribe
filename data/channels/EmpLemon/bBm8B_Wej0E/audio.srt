00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:14,000
So let's talk about jokes. Ideally, a joke is supposed to be funny. A knock-knock joke may be

2
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,200
the worst kind of joke in existence because knock-knock jokes aren't funny. Listening to

3
00:00:18,200 --> 00:00:22,920
a knock-knock joke is like watching a high school dance through a telescope. You can see the punch

4
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:27,880
line from a mile away. What you just heard was a pun, which is essentially a knock-knock joke

5
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:32,500
without the foreplay. Alfred Hitchcock once called the pun the highest form of literature.

6
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:37,240
Hitchcock was certainly a genius at filmmaking, but he was really being an idiot when he said

7
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:42,360
that. Puns aren't funny and neither are knock-knock jokes. What is funny, however, is this new

8
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:48,440
underground meme called Grabahan, mostly because it is so unexpected and unpredictable. Who knew

9
00:00:48,440 --> 00:00:54,040
that a random city in Indonesia could make such a dynamic and long-lasting meme? Now this meme

10
00:00:54,040 --> 00:00:58,600
stayed pretty obscure so far, so there's a good chance that many of you watching this are asking

11
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:03,200
yourselves the same question, what's so funny about Grabahan? And the answer to that is,

12
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:05,080
grab a handful of my nuts!
