00:00.000 --> 00:06.080
Hey, it's been a while since I made one of these update video thingies, probably because

00:06.080 --> 00:10.080
it's a waste of my time because no one fucking watches these.

00:10.080 --> 00:13.840
But anyway, today is a special day.

00:13.840 --> 00:21.060
And a lot of you may not know why, but today is special because it is the sixth anniversary

00:21.060 --> 00:22.960
of me opening this YouTube channel.

00:22.960 --> 00:28.620
Yes, I have now been making YouTube poops for six whole years.

00:29.140 --> 00:35.020
And by this point, most other poopers would have either quit or moved on to other pastures.

00:35.020 --> 00:41.540
But here I am, continuing to make these silly videos for the better part of a decade.

00:41.540 --> 00:46.280
And in that time, I've watched YouTube poop grow and change.

00:46.280 --> 00:52.380
At the same time, I've changed personally a hell of a lot, along with my videos.

00:52.380 --> 00:58.100
And with that being said, I have a lot of stuff I really need to get off of my chest.

00:58.100 --> 01:01.900
First thing, the long YouTube poops are over.

01:01.900 --> 01:05.620
The Pixar YouTube poops are over.

01:05.620 --> 01:09.340
If you're still sticking around for these, you just need to stop wasting your time and

01:09.340 --> 01:10.540
unsubscribe.

01:10.540 --> 01:15.880
I clearly explained I was moving to shorter YouTube poops nine months ago, and yet I still

01:15.880 --> 01:21.980
get dozens of comments on every video commanding me to start making quote unquote good YouTube

01:21.980 --> 01:23.540
poops again.

01:23.540 --> 01:31.160
Number two, and this may come off as a shocker to most of you, but I am a human being with

01:31.160 --> 01:34.160
a traditional role in society.

01:34.160 --> 01:41.620
I am not a YouTube poop making robot who sits on his ass for 16 hours a day making videos.

01:41.620 --> 01:47.660
I know it's difficult to be cognizant of this, but there's a guy behind the screen through

01:47.660 --> 01:49.400
which you watch my videos.

01:49.400 --> 01:55.200
I go to school and I take advanced classes with more work than most of you could possibly

01:55.200 --> 01:56.200
imagine.

01:56.200 --> 02:00.280
I also have a part-time job, and ever since September of last year, I've been writing

02:00.280 --> 02:03.840
essays on a weekly basis for college applications and scholarships.

02:03.840 --> 02:09.300
Basically, I have a small list of things to do in my life before I can actually work on

02:09.300 --> 02:13.920
YouTube poops, which brings me to my next point.

02:13.920 --> 02:18.760
Number three, I make YouTube poops for fun.

02:18.760 --> 02:20.760
I wasn't always popular, you know.

02:20.760 --> 02:25.960
There was a time when I just made these videos whenever I felt like it, added whatever random

02:25.960 --> 02:31.960
shit I wanted and uploaded it just to see what would happen and how people would react.

02:31.960 --> 02:37.080
Then somewhere along the way, my whole focus of what matters in this hobby began to change.

02:37.080 --> 02:41.880
At about the time when I started working on the non-credibles, I began making these videos

02:41.880 --> 02:46.400
with the purpose of pleasing other people while sacrificing my own enjoyment, and it

02:46.400 --> 02:51.840
worked because it was at this time when the greatest number of people bought into my channel.

02:51.840 --> 02:56.440
I had the greatest subscriber gains ever during this period.

02:56.440 --> 03:01.240
However, the success was a double-edged sword for several reasons.

03:01.240 --> 03:05.920
For one, I began to stop enjoying making videos.

03:05.920 --> 03:12.400
At about the time of deep frying Nemo, I was getting really tired of making really long

03:12.400 --> 03:13.880
YouTube poops.

03:13.880 --> 03:16.300
It just felt like a chore, you know.

03:16.300 --> 03:19.820
The point of YouTube poop for me is to get away from all the tedious shit I have to do

03:19.820 --> 03:20.820
in real life.

03:20.820 --> 03:26.460
It's supposed to feel liberating, not like, oh, I'm going back to the old grind.

03:26.460 --> 03:31.180
I never, ever want to feel that way about YouTube poop again.

03:31.180 --> 03:35.680
So therefore, beginning last year, I started making the videos I actually wanted to make.

03:35.680 --> 03:40.460
I just wanted to go back to the way it was before I had a shitload of fans so I could

03:40.460 --> 03:43.260
just crank out a quick video whenever I felt like it.

03:43.300 --> 03:48.780
Sure, the newer product is not as clever, robust, or logical as the more time-consuming

03:48.780 --> 03:52.140
poops, but the point is I actually enjoy making them.

03:52.140 --> 03:57.700
And at its essence, in its purest form, that's really the only thing that matters in YouTube

03:57.700 --> 03:58.700
poop.

03:58.700 --> 04:01.380
And I just wanted to return to that simplicity.

04:01.380 --> 04:03.860
Except it's not that simple.

04:03.860 --> 04:05.660
Because I am popular now.

04:05.660 --> 04:10.500
The other major negative consequence of my rise in popularity is that I have created

04:10.500 --> 04:17.700
a legion of jaded quote-unquote fans who expect nothing but perfection from my videos.

04:17.700 --> 04:22.700
For some reason, I've created this expectation that each successive video I make has to be

04:22.700 --> 04:26.780
more humorous, more ingenious, more daunting than the previous one.

04:26.780 --> 04:29.260
And for a few months, that may have been true.

04:29.260 --> 04:30.560
But now, it's not.

04:30.560 --> 04:34.720
Yet people still retain these sky-high expectations for my videos.

04:34.720 --> 04:39.180
It's gotten to the point that for the last several uploads, no matter what the video

04:39.180 --> 04:42.280
is, I lose almost 100 subscribers.

04:42.280 --> 04:47.280
I am certain that if I just uploaded nothing since October, I would have more subscribers

04:47.280 --> 04:48.280
right now.

04:48.280 --> 04:50.980
Let me level something with you guys right here, right now.

04:50.980 --> 04:56.700
The reason the newer poops are so different in quality from the previous ones is because

04:56.700 --> 04:59.900
I actually tried to have fun while making them.

04:59.900 --> 05:02.520
You know that Simpsons poop I just uploaded?

05:02.520 --> 05:07.100
That was the most fun I had working on a poop in years.

05:07.100 --> 05:08.260
Years!

05:08.260 --> 05:13.580
At least it was fun before I got absolutely shat on after uploading the damn thing.

05:13.580 --> 05:15.980
Oh, there's too much ear rape!

05:15.980 --> 05:17.780
It's too random!

05:17.780 --> 05:19.900
Why are the Simpsons green?

05:19.900 --> 05:21.780
Why are they green?

05:21.780 --> 05:23.740
Let me give you a few reasons.

05:23.740 --> 05:28.740
Number one, well, it avoids copyright, which is kinda useful in this day and age.

05:28.740 --> 05:31.060
Number two, it's never ogre.

05:31.060 --> 05:33.180
Number three, who gives a fuck that they're green?

05:33.180 --> 05:35.620
It's a fucking YouTube poop.

05:35.620 --> 05:36.780
I don't know.

05:36.780 --> 05:41.300
I've been making these videos for over six years now, and I've come to the conclusion

05:41.300 --> 05:44.780
that YTPs are not supposed to make sense.

05:44.780 --> 05:49.060
The more you apply logic to YTP, the less enjoyment you're gonna have.

05:49.060 --> 05:53.540
YTP is something where you just turn off your brain and let it happen.

05:53.540 --> 05:59.520
Can you self-professed YTP critics out there please take a step back and look at yourselves

05:59.520 --> 06:00.620
for a second?

06:00.620 --> 06:06.420
And yes, I'm aware that this only represents a small vocal minority of my fanbase.

06:06.420 --> 06:09.140
But you people are becoming genuinely upset.

06:09.140 --> 06:13.820
Your jimmies are getting rustled and they're spilling onto the table along with your salt

06:13.820 --> 06:17.900
shakers all because you didn't like some guy's YouTube poop.

06:17.900 --> 06:21.580
I'm not saying I'm against people criticizing my videos.

06:21.580 --> 06:28.580
Just try not to sound like this guy or this guy or this guy when writing your scathing

06:28.580 --> 06:31.300
reviews of my videos.

06:31.300 --> 06:33.820
Were my videos ever really that good?

06:33.820 --> 06:36.100
I mean, really.

06:36.100 --> 06:41.280
All of these people lambasting me in the comments insinuate that my videos have severely deteriorated

06:41.280 --> 06:45.860
in quality, whining that I don't spend enough time on my videos anymore.

06:45.860 --> 06:48.460
Of course I don't spend as much time on my videos anymore.

06:48.460 --> 06:53.900
I don't have enough time in the day to work on YouTube poops as much as I used to.

06:53.900 --> 06:58.700
I'm fucking sorry I can't spend 16 hours a day working on videos for you guys, but I'm

06:58.700 --> 07:03.200
trying to make the best of it by uploading short videos every few weeks rather than spending

07:03.200 --> 07:05.940
three months on one single fucking video.

07:05.940 --> 07:10.880
And it's these types of comments, the work harder and longer comments, that piss me off

07:10.880 --> 07:11.880
the most.

07:11.880 --> 07:15.980
I can tolerate comments complaining about ear rape or jokes, whatever.

07:15.980 --> 07:20.240
That's based on personal preference and there's nothing I can do about that.

07:20.240 --> 07:25.700
But don't you fucking command me to do something like I'm your fucking dog.

07:25.700 --> 07:28.700
I don't make these videos for you.

07:28.700 --> 07:33.700
If I did, this would be nothing more than another godforsaken boss to answer to in life.

07:33.700 --> 07:38.820
I already hear enough of this shit from my teachers, parents, managers, and the government.

07:38.820 --> 07:45.660
I don't need people to boss me around about fucking YouTube poops where the entire fucking

07:45.660 --> 07:48.980
purpose is to get away from that bullshit.

07:48.980 --> 07:53.580
If you're one of these people with the fucking delusion to think that I will listen to your

07:53.580 --> 07:57.300
hackneyed demands, you need to unsubscribe from this channel right now.

07:57.300 --> 07:58.300
I don't want you subscribed.

07:58.300 --> 08:01.260
I don't care if I lose 10,000 subscribers.

08:01.260 --> 08:05.140
You people already treat me like I'm the fucking fine bros by unsubscribing with every

08:05.140 --> 08:06.140
video.

08:06.140 --> 08:08.980
Well, this is the definitive unsubscribe video.

08:08.980 --> 08:12.180
Send me the crap below 100,000 again.

08:12.180 --> 08:15.820
At least it would remind me of a time when the shit was still fun, a time when I wasn't

08:15.820 --> 08:19.380
berated and pestered for every fucking video I upload.

08:19.380 --> 08:24.180
Send me below 50,000, back before the pedantic pricks at the YouTube forums have to open

08:24.180 --> 08:28.700
their mouths constantly about how bad of a person I am for being popular.

08:28.900 --> 08:31.780
I'm fucking sorry people like me, you two.

08:31.780 --> 08:33.100
What a crime!

08:33.100 --> 08:37.500
God forbid YouTube poop ever be more than a stupid self-indulgent inside joke shared

08:37.500 --> 08:39.140
by tens of people.

08:39.140 --> 08:43.380
I'm fucking sorry I sent new people to your forums in earnest, which you proceeded to

08:43.380 --> 08:45.940
shit on for not being from 2009.

08:45.940 --> 08:48.980
I'm fucking sorry it's not 2009 anymore.

08:48.980 --> 08:54.980
I'm sorry that time fucking exists and it causes things, including YTP, to change.

08:54.980 --> 08:58.980
I'm sure when scientists invent the first time machine, the first fucking thing they're

08:58.980 --> 09:05.100
going to do is go back to 2009 just so you guys can fap to fucking Robotnik CDi Fuckfest

09:05.100 --> 09:06.100
Adventure again.

09:06.100 --> 09:07.100
You know what?

09:07.100 --> 09:08.100
I'm done.

09:08.100 --> 09:10.660
I am done caring.

09:10.660 --> 09:13.400
The chains are off and I'm free.

09:13.400 --> 09:16.980
I'm finally free to be myself.

09:16.980 --> 09:26.980
So if you're still watching at this point, you're probably wondering, what's your point,

09:26.980 --> 09:27.980
Emp?

09:27.980 --> 09:31.780
Why have you made this butthurt rant over a couple of rage comments from people you'll

09:31.780 --> 09:33.140
never meet?

09:33.140 --> 09:39.620
Well, this is a video that needed to be made, and honestly, it's been a long time coming.

09:39.620 --> 09:44.500
But the real purpose for this video is to explain why things have been changing on this

09:44.500 --> 09:45.500
channel.

09:45.500 --> 09:51.340
The reason I changed my name and profile picture is to reflect the idea that I am moving forward

09:51.340 --> 09:52.900
with this YouTube channel.

09:52.900 --> 09:57.380
I've started to take a more diminished role in YouTube Poop and I intend to transition

09:57.380 --> 10:00.260
into more tangible content for this channel.

10:00.260 --> 10:05.060
I want to make new types of videos in which I'm more personally involved and I want to

10:05.060 --> 10:08.380
deliver commentary on a wide range of interesting issues.

10:08.380 --> 10:10.940
Now, does that mean I'm done with YouTube Poop?

10:10.940 --> 10:12.220
No, not at all.

10:12.220 --> 10:17.380
In fact, I'll continue to release short YouTube Poops fairly often, but be warned, the new

10:17.380 --> 10:18.380
videos are coming.

10:18.380 --> 10:22.300
They're not going to be here today or tomorrow, but don't be surprised when they start showing

10:22.300 --> 10:23.300
up.

10:23.300 --> 10:26.060
And since you're probably going to forget about this and complain anyway, let me give

10:26.060 --> 10:31.660
you a final word on what will be the last and only thing you'll ever need to know about

10:31.660 --> 10:33.200
me from now on.

10:33.200 --> 10:38.300
The only thing that's for sure about Emp is nothings for sure.
