1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,080
Hey, it's been a while since I made one of these update video thingies, probably because

2
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:10,080
it's a waste of my time because no one fucking watches these.

3
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:13,840
But anyway, today is a special day.

4
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:21,060
And a lot of you may not know why, but today is special because it is the sixth anniversary

5
00:00:21,060 --> 00:00:22,960
of me opening this YouTube channel.

6
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:28,620
Yes, I have now been making YouTube poops for six whole years.

7
00:00:29,140 --> 00:00:35,020
And by this point, most other poopers would have either quit or moved on to other pastures.

8
00:00:35,020 --> 00:00:41,540
But here I am, continuing to make these silly videos for the better part of a decade.

9
00:00:41,540 --> 00:00:46,280
And in that time, I've watched YouTube poop grow and change.

10
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:52,380
At the same time, I've changed personally a hell of a lot, along with my videos.

11
00:00:52,380 --> 00:00:58,100
And with that being said, I have a lot of stuff I really need to get off of my chest.

12
00:00:58,100 --> 00:01:01,900
First thing, the long YouTube poops are over.

13
00:01:01,900 --> 00:01:05,620
The Pixar YouTube poops are over.

14
00:01:05,620 --> 00:01:09,340
If you're still sticking around for these, you just need to stop wasting your time and

15
00:01:09,340 --> 00:01:10,540
unsubscribe.

16
00:01:10,540 --> 00:01:15,880
I clearly explained I was moving to shorter YouTube poops nine months ago, and yet I still

17
00:01:15,880 --> 00:01:21,980
get dozens of comments on every video commanding me to start making quote unquote good YouTube

18
00:01:21,980 --> 00:01:23,540
poops again.

19
00:01:23,540 --> 00:01:31,160
Number two, and this may come off as a shocker to most of you, but I am a human being with

20
00:01:31,160 --> 00:01:34,160
a traditional role in society.

21
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:41,620
I am not a YouTube poop making robot who sits on his ass for 16 hours a day making videos.

22
00:01:41,620 --> 00:01:47,660
I know it's difficult to be cognizant of this, but there's a guy behind the screen through

23
00:01:47,660 --> 00:01:49,400
which you watch my videos.

24
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:55,200
I go to school and I take advanced classes with more work than most of you could possibly

25
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:56,200
imagine.

26
00:01:56,200 --> 00:02:00,280
I also have a part-time job, and ever since September of last year, I've been writing

27
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:03,840
essays on a weekly basis for college applications and scholarships.

28
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:09,300
Basically, I have a small list of things to do in my life before I can actually work on

29
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:13,920
YouTube poops, which brings me to my next point.

30
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:18,760
Number three, I make YouTube poops for fun.

31
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:20,760
I wasn't always popular, you know.

32
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:25,960
There was a time when I just made these videos whenever I felt like it, added whatever random

33
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:31,960
shit I wanted and uploaded it just to see what would happen and how people would react.

34
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:37,080
Then somewhere along the way, my whole focus of what matters in this hobby began to change.

35
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:41,880
At about the time when I started working on the non-credibles, I began making these videos

36
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:46,400
with the purpose of pleasing other people while sacrificing my own enjoyment, and it

37
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:51,840
worked because it was at this time when the greatest number of people bought into my channel.

38
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:56,440
I had the greatest subscriber gains ever during this period.

39
00:02:56,440 --> 00:03:01,240
However, the success was a double-edged sword for several reasons.

40
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:05,920
For one, I began to stop enjoying making videos.

41
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:12,400
At about the time of deep frying Nemo, I was getting really tired of making really long

42
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:13,880
YouTube poops.

43
00:03:13,880 --> 00:03:16,300
It just felt like a chore, you know.

44
00:03:16,300 --> 00:03:19,820
The point of YouTube poop for me is to get away from all the tedious shit I have to do

45
00:03:19,820 --> 00:03:20,820
in real life.

46
00:03:20,820 --> 00:03:26,460
It's supposed to feel liberating, not like, oh, I'm going back to the old grind.

47
00:03:26,460 --> 00:03:31,180
I never, ever want to feel that way about YouTube poop again.

48
00:03:31,180 --> 00:03:35,680
So therefore, beginning last year, I started making the videos I actually wanted to make.

49
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:40,460
I just wanted to go back to the way it was before I had a shitload of fans so I could

50
00:03:40,460 --> 00:03:43,260
just crank out a quick video whenever I felt like it.

51
00:03:43,300 --> 00:03:48,780
Sure, the newer product is not as clever, robust, or logical as the more time-consuming

52
00:03:48,780 --> 00:03:52,140
poops, but the point is I actually enjoy making them.

53
00:03:52,140 --> 00:03:57,700
And at its essence, in its purest form, that's really the only thing that matters in YouTube

54
00:03:57,700 --> 00:03:58,700
poop.

55
00:03:58,700 --> 00:04:01,380
And I just wanted to return to that simplicity.

56
00:04:01,380 --> 00:04:03,860
Except it's not that simple.

57
00:04:03,860 --> 00:04:05,660
Because I am popular now.

58
00:04:05,660 --> 00:04:10,500
The other major negative consequence of my rise in popularity is that I have created

59
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:17,700
a legion of jaded quote-unquote fans who expect nothing but perfection from my videos.

60
00:04:17,700 --> 00:04:22,700
For some reason, I've created this expectation that each successive video I make has to be

61
00:04:22,700 --> 00:04:26,780
more humorous, more ingenious, more daunting than the previous one.

62
00:04:26,780 --> 00:04:29,260
And for a few months, that may have been true.

63
00:04:29,260 --> 00:04:30,560
But now, it's not.

64
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:34,720
Yet people still retain these sky-high expectations for my videos.

65
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:39,180
It's gotten to the point that for the last several uploads, no matter what the video

66
00:04:39,180 --> 00:04:42,280
is, I lose almost 100 subscribers.

67
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:47,280
I am certain that if I just uploaded nothing since October, I would have more subscribers

68
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:48,280
right now.

69
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:50,980
Let me level something with you guys right here, right now.

70
00:04:50,980 --> 00:04:56,700
The reason the newer poops are so different in quality from the previous ones is because

71
00:04:56,700 --> 00:04:59,900
I actually tried to have fun while making them.

72
00:04:59,900 --> 00:05:02,520
You know that Simpsons poop I just uploaded?

73
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:07,100
That was the most fun I had working on a poop in years.

74
00:05:07,100 --> 00:05:08,260
Years!

75
00:05:08,260 --> 00:05:13,580
At least it was fun before I got absolutely shat on after uploading the damn thing.

76
00:05:13,580 --> 00:05:15,980
Oh, there's too much ear rape!

77
00:05:15,980 --> 00:05:17,780
It's too random!

78
00:05:17,780 --> 00:05:19,900
Why are the Simpsons green?

79
00:05:19,900 --> 00:05:21,780
Why are they green?

80
00:05:21,780 --> 00:05:23,740
Let me give you a few reasons.

81
00:05:23,740 --> 00:05:28,740
Number one, well, it avoids copyright, which is kinda useful in this day and age.

82
00:05:28,740 --> 00:05:31,060
Number two, it's never ogre.

83
00:05:31,060 --> 00:05:33,180
Number three, who gives a fuck that they're green?

84
00:05:33,180 --> 00:05:35,620
It's a fucking YouTube poop.

85
00:05:35,620 --> 00:05:36,780
I don't know.

86
00:05:36,780 --> 00:05:41,300
I've been making these videos for over six years now, and I've come to the conclusion

87
00:05:41,300 --> 00:05:44,780
that YTPs are not supposed to make sense.

88
00:05:44,780 --> 00:05:49,060
The more you apply logic to YTP, the less enjoyment you're gonna have.

89
00:05:49,060 --> 00:05:53,540
YTP is something where you just turn off your brain and let it happen.

90
00:05:53,540 --> 00:05:59,520
Can you self-professed YTP critics out there please take a step back and look at yourselves

91
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:00,620
for a second?

92
00:06:00,620 --> 00:06:06,420
And yes, I'm aware that this only represents a small vocal minority of my fanbase.

93
00:06:06,420 --> 00:06:09,140
But you people are becoming genuinely upset.

94
00:06:09,140 --> 00:06:13,820
Your jimmies are getting rustled and they're spilling onto the table along with your salt

95
00:06:13,820 --> 00:06:17,900
shakers all because you didn't like some guy's YouTube poop.

96
00:06:17,900 --> 00:06:21,580
I'm not saying I'm against people criticizing my videos.

97
00:06:21,580 --> 00:06:28,580
Just try not to sound like this guy or this guy or this guy when writing your scathing

98
00:06:28,580 --> 00:06:31,300
reviews of my videos.

99
00:06:31,300 --> 00:06:33,820
Were my videos ever really that good?

100
00:06:33,820 --> 00:06:36,100
I mean, really.

101
00:06:36,100 --> 00:06:41,280
All of these people lambasting me in the comments insinuate that my videos have severely deteriorated

102
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:45,860
in quality, whining that I don't spend enough time on my videos anymore.

103
00:06:45,860 --> 00:06:48,460
Of course I don't spend as much time on my videos anymore.

104
00:06:48,460 --> 00:06:53,900
I don't have enough time in the day to work on YouTube poops as much as I used to.

105
00:06:53,900 --> 00:06:58,700
I'm fucking sorry I can't spend 16 hours a day working on videos for you guys, but I'm

106
00:06:58,700 --> 00:07:03,200
trying to make the best of it by uploading short videos every few weeks rather than spending

107
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:05,940
three months on one single fucking video.

108
00:07:05,940 --> 00:07:10,880
And it's these types of comments, the work harder and longer comments, that piss me off

109
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:11,880
the most.

110
00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:15,980
I can tolerate comments complaining about ear rape or jokes, whatever.

111
00:07:15,980 --> 00:07:20,240
That's based on personal preference and there's nothing I can do about that.

112
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:25,700
But don't you fucking command me to do something like I'm your fucking dog.

113
00:07:25,700 --> 00:07:28,700
I don't make these videos for you.

114
00:07:28,700 --> 00:07:33,700
If I did, this would be nothing more than another godforsaken boss to answer to in life.

115
00:07:33,700 --> 00:07:38,820
I already hear enough of this shit from my teachers, parents, managers, and the government.

116
00:07:38,820 --> 00:07:45,660
I don't need people to boss me around about fucking YouTube poops where the entire fucking

117
00:07:45,660 --> 00:07:48,980
purpose is to get away from that bullshit.

118
00:07:48,980 --> 00:07:53,580
If you're one of these people with the fucking delusion to think that I will listen to your

119
00:07:53,580 --> 00:07:57,300
hackneyed demands, you need to unsubscribe from this channel right now.

120
00:07:57,300 --> 00:07:58,300
I don't want you subscribed.

121
00:07:58,300 --> 00:08:01,260
I don't care if I lose 10,000 subscribers.

122
00:08:01,260 --> 00:08:05,140
You people already treat me like I'm the fucking fine bros by unsubscribing with every

123
00:08:05,140 --> 00:08:06,140
video.

124
00:08:06,140 --> 00:08:08,980
Well, this is the definitive unsubscribe video.

125
00:08:08,980 --> 00:08:12,180
Send me the crap below 100,000 again.

126
00:08:12,180 --> 00:08:15,820
At least it would remind me of a time when the shit was still fun, a time when I wasn't

127
00:08:15,820 --> 00:08:19,380
berated and pestered for every fucking video I upload.

128
00:08:19,380 --> 00:08:24,180
Send me below 50,000, back before the pedantic pricks at the YouTube forums have to open

129
00:08:24,180 --> 00:08:28,700
their mouths constantly about how bad of a person I am for being popular.

130
00:08:28,900 --> 00:08:31,780
I'm fucking sorry people like me, you two.

131
00:08:31,780 --> 00:08:33,100
What a crime!

132
00:08:33,100 --> 00:08:37,500
God forbid YouTube poop ever be more than a stupid self-indulgent inside joke shared

133
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:39,140
by tens of people.

134
00:08:39,140 --> 00:08:43,380
I'm fucking sorry I sent new people to your forums in earnest, which you proceeded to

135
00:08:43,380 --> 00:08:45,940
shit on for not being from 2009.

136
00:08:45,940 --> 00:08:48,980
I'm fucking sorry it's not 2009 anymore.

137
00:08:48,980 --> 00:08:54,980
I'm sorry that time fucking exists and it causes things, including YTP, to change.

138
00:08:54,980 --> 00:08:58,980
I'm sure when scientists invent the first time machine, the first fucking thing they're

139
00:08:58,980 --> 00:09:05,100
going to do is go back to 2009 just so you guys can fap to fucking Robotnik CDi Fuckfest

140
00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:06,100
Adventure again.

141
00:09:06,100 --> 00:09:07,100
You know what?

142
00:09:07,100 --> 00:09:08,100
I'm done.

143
00:09:08,100 --> 00:09:10,660
I am done caring.

144
00:09:10,660 --> 00:09:13,400
The chains are off and I'm free.

145
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:16,980
I'm finally free to be myself.

146
00:09:16,980 --> 00:09:26,980
So if you're still watching at this point, you're probably wondering, what's your point,

147
00:09:26,980 --> 00:09:27,980
Emp?

148
00:09:27,980 --> 00:09:31,780
Why have you made this butthurt rant over a couple of rage comments from people you'll

149
00:09:31,780 --> 00:09:33,140
never meet?

150
00:09:33,140 --> 00:09:39,620
Well, this is a video that needed to be made, and honestly, it's been a long time coming.

151
00:09:39,620 --> 00:09:44,500
But the real purpose for this video is to explain why things have been changing on this

152
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:45,500
channel.

153
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:51,340
The reason I changed my name and profile picture is to reflect the idea that I am moving forward

154
00:09:51,340 --> 00:09:52,900
with this YouTube channel.

155
00:09:52,900 --> 00:09:57,380
I've started to take a more diminished role in YouTube Poop and I intend to transition

156
00:09:57,380 --> 00:10:00,260
into more tangible content for this channel.

157
00:10:00,260 --> 00:10:05,060
I want to make new types of videos in which I'm more personally involved and I want to

158
00:10:05,060 --> 00:10:08,380
deliver commentary on a wide range of interesting issues.

159
00:10:08,380 --> 00:10:10,940
Now, does that mean I'm done with YouTube Poop?

160
00:10:10,940 --> 00:10:12,220
No, not at all.

161
00:10:12,220 --> 00:10:17,380
In fact, I'll continue to release short YouTube Poops fairly often, but be warned, the new

162
00:10:17,380 --> 00:10:18,380
videos are coming.

163
00:10:18,380 --> 00:10:22,300
They're not going to be here today or tomorrow, but don't be surprised when they start showing

164
00:10:22,300 --> 00:10:23,300
