0	6080	Hey, it's been a while since I made one of these update video thingies, probably because
6080	10080	it's a waste of my time because no one fucking watches these.
10080	13840	But anyway, today is a special day.
13840	21060	And a lot of you may not know why, but today is special because it is the sixth anniversary
21060	22960	of me opening this YouTube channel.
22960	28620	Yes, I have now been making YouTube poops for six whole years.
29140	35020	And by this point, most other poopers would have either quit or moved on to other pastures.
35020	41540	But here I am, continuing to make these silly videos for the better part of a decade.
41540	46280	And in that time, I've watched YouTube poop grow and change.
46280	52380	At the same time, I've changed personally a hell of a lot, along with my videos.
52380	58100	And with that being said, I have a lot of stuff I really need to get off of my chest.
58100	61900	First thing, the long YouTube poops are over.
61900	65620	The Pixar YouTube poops are over.
65620	69340	If you're still sticking around for these, you just need to stop wasting your time and
69340	70540	unsubscribe.
70540	75880	I clearly explained I was moving to shorter YouTube poops nine months ago, and yet I still
75880	81980	get dozens of comments on every video commanding me to start making quote unquote good YouTube
81980	83540	poops again.
83540	91160	Number two, and this may come off as a shocker to most of you, but I am a human being with
91160	94160	a traditional role in society.
94160	101620	I am not a YouTube poop making robot who sits on his ass for 16 hours a day making videos.
101620	107660	I know it's difficult to be cognizant of this, but there's a guy behind the screen through
107660	109400	which you watch my videos.
109400	115200	I go to school and I take advanced classes with more work than most of you could possibly
115200	116200	imagine.
116200	120280	I also have a part-time job, and ever since September of last year, I've been writing
120280	123840	essays on a weekly basis for college applications and scholarships.
123840	129300	Basically, I have a small list of things to do in my life before I can actually work on
129300	133920	YouTube poops, which brings me to my next point.
133920	138760	Number three, I make YouTube poops for fun.
138760	140760	I wasn't always popular, you know.
140760	145960	There was a time when I just made these videos whenever I felt like it, added whatever random
145960	151960	shit I wanted and uploaded it just to see what would happen and how people would react.
151960	157080	Then somewhere along the way, my whole focus of what matters in this hobby began to change.
157080	161880	At about the time when I started working on the non-credibles, I began making these videos
161880	166400	with the purpose of pleasing other people while sacrificing my own enjoyment, and it
166400	171840	worked because it was at this time when the greatest number of people bought into my channel.
171840	176440	I had the greatest subscriber gains ever during this period.
176440	181240	However, the success was a double-edged sword for several reasons.
181240	185920	For one, I began to stop enjoying making videos.
185920	192400	At about the time of deep frying Nemo, I was getting really tired of making really long
192400	193880	YouTube poops.
193880	196300	It just felt like a chore, you know.
196300	199820	The point of YouTube poop for me is to get away from all the tedious shit I have to do
199820	200820	in real life.
200820	206460	It's supposed to feel liberating, not like, oh, I'm going back to the old grind.
206460	211180	I never, ever want to feel that way about YouTube poop again.
211180	215680	So therefore, beginning last year, I started making the videos I actually wanted to make.
215680	220460	I just wanted to go back to the way it was before I had a shitload of fans so I could
220460	223260	just crank out a quick video whenever I felt like it.
223300	228780	Sure, the newer product is not as clever, robust, or logical as the more time-consuming
228780	232140	poops, but the point is I actually enjoy making them.
232140	237700	And at its essence, in its purest form, that's really the only thing that matters in YouTube
237700	238700	poop.
238700	241380	And I just wanted to return to that simplicity.
241380	243860	Except it's not that simple.
243860	245660	Because I am popular now.
245660	250500	The other major negative consequence of my rise in popularity is that I have created
250500	257700	a legion of jaded quote-unquote fans who expect nothing but perfection from my videos.
257700	262700	For some reason, I've created this expectation that each successive video I make has to be
262700	266780	more humorous, more ingenious, more daunting than the previous one.
266780	269260	And for a few months, that may have been true.
269260	270560	But now, it's not.
270560	274720	Yet people still retain these sky-high expectations for my videos.
274720	279180	It's gotten to the point that for the last several uploads, no matter what the video
279180	282280	is, I lose almost 100 subscribers.
282280	287280	I am certain that if I just uploaded nothing since October, I would have more subscribers
287280	288280	right now.
288280	290980	Let me level something with you guys right here, right now.
290980	296700	The reason the newer poops are so different in quality from the previous ones is because
296700	299900	I actually tried to have fun while making them.
299900	302520	You know that Simpsons poop I just uploaded?
302520	307100	That was the most fun I had working on a poop in years.
307100	308260	Years!
308260	313580	At least it was fun before I got absolutely shat on after uploading the damn thing.
313580	315980	Oh, there's too much ear rape!
315980	317780	It's too random!
317780	319900	Why are the Simpsons green?
319900	321780	Why are they green?
321780	323740	Let me give you a few reasons.
323740	328740	Number one, well, it avoids copyright, which is kinda useful in this day and age.
328740	331060	Number two, it's never ogre.
331060	333180	Number three, who gives a fuck that they're green?
333180	335620	It's a fucking YouTube poop.
335620	336780	I don't know.
336780	341300	I've been making these videos for over six years now, and I've come to the conclusion
341300	344780	that YTPs are not supposed to make sense.
344780	349060	The more you apply logic to YTP, the less enjoyment you're gonna have.
349060	353540	YTP is something where you just turn off your brain and let it happen.
353540	359520	Can you self-professed YTP critics out there please take a step back and look at yourselves
359520	360620	for a second?
360620	366420	And yes, I'm aware that this only represents a small vocal minority of my fanbase.
366420	369140	But you people are becoming genuinely upset.
369140	373820	Your jimmies are getting rustled and they're spilling onto the table along with your salt
373820	377900	shakers all because you didn't like some guy's YouTube poop.
377900	381580	I'm not saying I'm against people criticizing my videos.
381580	388580	Just try not to sound like this guy or this guy or this guy when writing your scathing
388580	391300	reviews of my videos.
391300	393820	Were my videos ever really that good?
393820	396100	I mean, really.
396100	401280	All of these people lambasting me in the comments insinuate that my videos have severely deteriorated
401280	405860	in quality, whining that I don't spend enough time on my videos anymore.
405860	408460	Of course I don't spend as much time on my videos anymore.
408460	413900	I don't have enough time in the day to work on YouTube poops as much as I used to.
413900	418700	I'm fucking sorry I can't spend 16 hours a day working on videos for you guys, but I'm
418700	423200	trying to make the best of it by uploading short videos every few weeks rather than spending
423200	425940	three months on one single fucking video.
425940	430880	And it's these types of comments, the work harder and longer comments, that piss me off
430880	431880	the most.
431880	435980	I can tolerate comments complaining about ear rape or jokes, whatever.
435980	440240	That's based on personal preference and there's nothing I can do about that.
440240	445700	But don't you fucking command me to do something like I'm your fucking dog.
445700	448700	I don't make these videos for you.
448700	453700	If I did, this would be nothing more than another godforsaken boss to answer to in life.
453700	458820	I already hear enough of this shit from my teachers, parents, managers, and the government.
458820	465660	I don't need people to boss me around about fucking YouTube poops where the entire fucking
465660	468980	purpose is to get away from that bullshit.
468980	473580	If you're one of these people with the fucking delusion to think that I will listen to your
473580	477300	hackneyed demands, you need to unsubscribe from this channel right now.
477300	478300	I don't want you subscribed.
478300	481260	I don't care if I lose 10,000 subscribers.
481260	485140	You people already treat me like I'm the fucking fine bros by unsubscribing with every
485140	486140	video.
486140	488980	Well, this is the definitive unsubscribe video.
488980	492180	Send me the crap below 100,000 again.
492180	495820	At least it would remind me of a time when the shit was still fun, a time when I wasn't
495820	499380	berated and pestered for every fucking video I upload.
499380	504180	Send me below 50,000, back before the pedantic pricks at the YouTube forums have to open
504180	508700	their mouths constantly about how bad of a person I am for being popular.
508900	511780	I'm fucking sorry people like me, you two.
511780	513100	What a crime!
513100	517500	God forbid YouTube poop ever be more than a stupid self-indulgent inside joke shared
517500	519140	by tens of people.
519140	523380	I'm fucking sorry I sent new people to your forums in earnest, which you proceeded to
523380	525940	shit on for not being from 2009.
525940	528980	I'm fucking sorry it's not 2009 anymore.
528980	534980	I'm sorry that time fucking exists and it causes things, including YTP, to change.
534980	538980	I'm sure when scientists invent the first time machine, the first fucking thing they're
538980	545100	going to do is go back to 2009 just so you guys can fap to fucking Robotnik CDi Fuckfest
545100	546100	Adventure again.
546100	547100	You know what?
547100	548100	I'm done.
548100	550660	I am done caring.
550660	553400	The chains are off and I'm free.
553400	556980	I'm finally free to be myself.
556980	566980	So if you're still watching at this point, you're probably wondering, what's your point,
566980	567980	Emp?
567980	571780	Why have you made this butthurt rant over a couple of rage comments from people you'll
571780	573140	never meet?
573140	579620	Well, this is a video that needed to be made, and honestly, it's been a long time coming.
579620	584500	But the real purpose for this video is to explain why things have been changing on this
584500	585500	channel.
585500	591340	The reason I changed my name and profile picture is to reflect the idea that I am moving forward
591340	592900	with this YouTube channel.
592900	597380	I've started to take a more diminished role in YouTube Poop and I intend to transition
597380	600260	into more tangible content for this channel.
600260	605060	I want to make new types of videos in which I'm more personally involved and I want to
605060	608380	deliver commentary on a wide range of interesting issues.
608380	610940	Now, does that mean I'm done with YouTube Poop?
610940	612220	No, not at all.
612220	617380	In fact, I'll continue to release short YouTube Poops fairly often, but be warned, the new
617380	618380	videos are coming.
618380	622300	They're not going to be here today or tomorrow, but don't be surprised when they start showing
622300	623300	up.
623300	626060	And since you're probably going to forget about this and complain anyway, let me give
626060	631660	you a final word on what will be the last and only thing you'll ever need to know about
631660	633200	me from now on.
633200	638300	The only thing that's for sure about Emp is nothings for sure.
