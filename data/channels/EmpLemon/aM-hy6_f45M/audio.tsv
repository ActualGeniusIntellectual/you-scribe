0	10000	September 2013 saw the end of one of the greatest episodic comedies of all time as Futurama aired its final episode.
10000	18000	I was just a kid in high school at the time and my biggest pastime was turning on Comedy Central or Adult Swim and just grinding out homework late into the evening.
18000	22000	I'll always remember the end of Futurama as such a bittersweet moment.
22000	29000	We finally got to see the ultimate payoff of the series' 15-year long journey, but at the same time, this was the end.
29000	35000	No one was sure if there would ever be another show like it again. Fortunately for us, we didn't have to wait long.
35000	64000	I remember it was around Thanksgiving when Adult Swim started airing the promos for Rick and Morty, a show that looked unlike anything the network had ever produced before.
64000	70000	Adult Swim had always existed as a playground of artistic expression and creative experimentation.
70000	77000	It's a channel within a channel, allowing it to operate without the financial responsibilities of a major media network.
77000	83000	In the early days, Adult Swim mainly subsisted by syndicating canceled shows from the Fox network.
83000	91000	They had a small but loyal viewer base who were instrumental in convincing network executives to give shows like Futurama a second chance.
91000	96000	However, the most intriguing parts of Adult Swim can be found in their original programming.
96000	103000	For the longest time, Adult Swim originals were characterized by extremely crude, low-budget animation and avant-garde humor.
103000	109000	Part of the charm of shows like Aqua Teen Hunger Force is that something so strange could exist on television at all.
109000	118000	This type of show earned Adult Swim the unofficial label of the Stoner's Paradise, but I don't think it's fair to define the network along this narrow premise.
118000	122000	Adult Swim boldly greenlit shows that couldn't exist on any other network.
122000	128000	The Boondocks was a beautifully animated, brilliantly written show that offered cogent commentary on social issues.
128000	131000	But due to its narrow appeal, no other network wanted it.
131000	135000	Adult Swim was the lone network who didn't care about marketability.
135000	143000	They handed artists the reins to present their vision, unfiltered and unneutered by a rigid obligation to appeasing corporate overlords.
143000	147000	In many ways, Rick and Morty was no different than any other Adult Swim show.
147000	156000	The origins of the show can be traced back to The Adventures of Doc and Marty, a crude parody of Back to the Future animated and voiced by Justin Roiland.
156000	163000	The webtoon was hosted on Channel 101, an online hub for experimental television hosted by comedian Dan Harmon.
163000	169000	Years later, the animation would serve as the blueprint for Adult Swim's newest animated series.
169000	172000	And away we go!
177000	189000	Wow! What happened back there?
189000	191000	Why don't you ask the smartest people in the universe, Jerry?
191000	196000	If I could use one word to describe Rick and Morty, I'd say it's a very unique show.
196000	198000	There's nothing else like it on television.
198000	203000	It's an unholy combination of Futurama, Regular Show and Freddy Got Fingered.
203000	206000	The show is simultaneously crude and elegant.
206000	211000	It features both spontaneous improvisation and meticulous attention to detail.
211000	217000	It's impressive how the writers managed to create a show like this without it turning out completely incoherent.
217000	223000	Historically, we have to look back on Rick and Morty as one of the most culturally significant shows of its decade.
223000	228000	Perhaps no other show connected more with the zeitgeist of the 2010s.
228000	233000	It wasn't just entertaining. It captured the hearts and minds of a generation of young adults.
233000	238000	Rick and Morty encompasses the search for meaning in an age of aimlessness and cynicism.
238000	242000	It's not just a show about an anti-hero. It's an anti-show.
242000	245000	Morty, what did you do? You killed the Simpsons, Morty!
245000	250000	Nearly every aspect of the show is designed to subvert the platitudes of conventional media.
250000	253000	It's a sitcom where nothing ever goes back to normal.
253000	259000	The characters occupy a wacky, cartoony world but suffer realistic, gruesome consequences.
259000	266000	The writers will intentionally disrupt a sappy emotional moment with a goofy fourth wall break that obliterates any tension in the scene.
266000	271000	This sardonic tongue-in-cheek deprecation is something that could have only succeeded in the internet age.
271000	273000	And succeed it did.
273000	277000	Rick and Morty's first season premiered to an audience of one million viewers.
277000	280000	By the season finale, the audience had effectively doubled.
280000	285000	For the first time ever, people were going out of their way to tune into Adult Swim on Sunday nights.
285000	291000	New episodes would generate widespread discussion, memes and theories on forums across the web.
291000	296000	It was not uncommon at this time to get millions of views on YouTube videos just talking about the show.
296000	300000	Rick and Morty was a hit with both casual viewers and critics.
300000	305000	At one point peaking at number seven on IMDb's top 250 TV shows.
305000	311000	On paper it appears to be not just one of the greatest shows of its time, but one of the greatest of all time.
311000	319000	And yet when you ask people their opinion on the show today, you'll find that the responses are much more polarizing than the critical consensus would have you believe.
319000	324000	It seems you can't mention the show online anymore without sparking a vicious debate.
324000	328000	Nowadays there are lots of people who say the show went downhill.
328000	331000	Some say that the show was never good in the first place.
331000	338000	I remember a time when the show was universally revered, but somewhere along the way something went very, very wrong.
338000	344000	In order to understand what made people hate Rick and Morty, we have to understand what made people love Rick and Morty.
349000	351000	Well, what do you love about Rick and Morty?
351000	357000	Most people would say that they watch Rick and Morty to see two dudes go on wacky sci-fi adventures.
357000	360000	Many like to praise the clever and shocking comedy.
360000	363000	Some find the crude improvised moments charming.
363000	369000	Others relate to the show's nihilist overtones and appreciate its commentary on the nature of society.
369000	376000	A lot of people became invested in the lore and world building and keep watching to see where the story goes next.
376000	385000	All of these are valid reasons to like the show, but if you ask me, a lot of people overlook the one element that truly makes Rick and Morty click.
385000	389000	Ask yourself this, what is Rick and Morty about?
389000	398000	You could come up with a million answers to this question, but ultimately at its core, Rick and Morty is a show about a dysfunctional family.
398000	404000	More specifically, Rick and Morty is a show about how a dysfunctional family deals with identity.
404000	409000	Coming of age, belonging, wasted potential, mediocrity and loneliness.
409000	414000	These are all prevailing conflicts embodied by each member of the Smith family.
414000	421000	I initially compared Rick and Morty to Futurama, but it thematically has much more in common with The Simpsons.
421000	430000	At a superficial level, you could describe Rick and Morty as a sci-fi comedy, but at a conceptual level, the show is much closer to a family drama.
430000	436000	This is the thematic engine which drives the characters, the story and the philosophy of the show.
436000	442000	But don't just take my word for it, the answer was hiding in plain sight all along from the very beginning.
443000	444000	Don't swim.
444000	445000	Cover me.
445000	446000	Science makes sense.
446000	448000	Family doesn't.
456000	466000	Unfortunately, I feel like most of the audience have fundamentally misunderstood the overall conceit of the show, choosing instead to focus on the far more bombastic sci-fi elements.
466000	475000	Much of the controversy around the show today can be attributed to the audience basing their expectations around a sci-fi adventure rather than a family drama.
475000	481000	Early on, this led to numerous articles ordaining Rick and Morty the smartest show on television.
481000	488000	This ultimately caused people to assign tremendous scientific and philosophical weight towards nonsensical aspects of the show.
488000	493000	You had people trying to dissect the greater intellectual meaning behind Mr. Poopy Butthole.
493000	500000	Rick and Morty is a very clever show, but most of the science presented by the show is more or less arbitrary.
500000	505000	Futurama was a show that was far more realistic in its portrayal of scientific concepts.
505000	511000	One time, Ken Keeler even presented an original mathematical proof in the form of an episode.
511000	517000	But simply being a smart show is not enough to carry a piece of media to transcendent popularity.
517000	524000	Science fiction has always existed as the awkward nerdy sibling to its far more popular counterpart, fantasy.
524000	531000	It's difficult to engage audiences with science fiction when most people don't even have a basic understanding of science.
531000	539000	This often leads to science fiction feeling sterile and esoteric as they alienate general audiences with complex scientific jargon.
539000	545000	In order to make sci-fi more approachable, you have to add in a grounded element that the average person can relate to.
546000	553000	For Futurama, this comes in the form of the everyman fry, the search for purpose and fitting into an alien world.
553000	557000	These are somewhat universal themes that everyone can understand.
557000	562000	Star Wars and Star Trek were both synonymous with sci-fi in the 20th century.
562000	571000	One of these franchises exploded as an ubiquitous cultural behemoth, while the other is still generally regarded as a niche nerdy subculture.
571000	577000	The difference is that Star Wars had more simple and relatable elements to help people engage with the story.
577000	582000	On paper, the Star Wars saga is about an epic space adventure.
582000	587000	But at its core, Star Wars simply tells the story of a dysfunctional family.
591000	597000	Likewise, Rick and Morty is the story of a dysfunctional family told through the lens of science fiction.
597000	602000	The show uses science fiction as a means to explore the dynamics of family drama.
602000	609000	Nearly all sci-fi concepts in the show only serve to accent the internal conflict among family members.
609000	612000	The Meeseeks box represents the family's insecurities.
612000	616000	Interdimensional cable explores choices and consequences.
616000	625000	The entire multiverse serves as an allegory for Rick's inability to confront his personal demons, choosing instead to run away and forget about them.
625000	631000	The show tends to focus on Rick more than anyone else because he is the most flawed character.
631000	634000	Morty, do you know what wubba lubba dub dub means?
634000	637000	Uh, that's just Rick's stupid nonsense catchphrase.
637000	643000	It's not nonsense at all. In my people's tongue, it means, I am in great pain. Please help me.
647000	655000	Lots of people have interpreted Rick's character as the embodiment of nihilism and have used this idea to define Rick and Morty as a nihilist show.
656000	661000	I would actually argue that Rick's early characterization serves as a warning against nihilism.
661000	668000	On the surface, Rick appears to be an aloof renegade who is too smart to care about the universe's problems.
674000	680000	However, the more you watch, the more you realize that Rick's unparalleled intellect has left him profoundly lonely.
686000	692000	He must keep himself constantly inebriated in order to shield himself from the harsh realities of existence.
692000	700000	Rick is terrified by the fact that no matter how smart he is, he will never be able to truly escape his human flaws.
700000	703000	Because to be human is to be irrational.
703000	707000	There is no empirical scientific reason to care about others.
707000	714000	You could live your whole life simply exploiting the goodwill of your peers like they're a dispensable resource and it wouldn't make a difference.
714000	717000	The nihilist side of Rick wants him to do just that.
717000	722000	We both know that if there's any truth in the universe, it's that Ricks don't care about Mortys.
722000	726000	But deep down, he really does care about certain people, his family.
726000	732000	Rick's overwhelmingly logical mind forces him to treat the universe with a nihilist outlook.
732000	735000	But in doing so, he loses his humanity.
735000	738000	Break the cycle, Morty. Rise above. Focus on science.
738000	746000	Using science, Rick can invent anything he wants, yet he remains unable to form a meaningful connection with anyone in the universe.
746000	749000	Not even with identical versions of himself.
749000	754000	Rick's characterization provides nuanced commentary about the nature of human progress.
754000	761000	As our civilization becomes more technologically advanced, are we losing touch with what makes us human?
761000	769000	Why does it feel like despite existing in the smartest era of human history, people are more miserable today than ever before?
769000	773000	There's a jaded wisdom to Rick and Morty that's oddly uplifting at times.
773000	782000	The show won't hold back at acknowledging the painful brutality that life has to offer, but it provides consolation for why you shouldn't just quit.
782000	790000	The philosophy of Rick and Morty is less about wallowing in the bleak moments of life, but rather salvaging meaning from those bleak moments.
790000	796000	Do I agree with Rick that nothing means anything? No, I do not.
796000	802000	Because the knowledge that nothing matters, while accurate, gets you nowhere.
805000	811000	A prevailing theme of the early seasons is that even at your lowest point, your decisions still do matter.
811000	815000	Rick and Morty makes this apparent through the importance of consequences.
815000	821000	It's a show where minor mistakes can cause long-lasting and permanent damage to the characters and world.
821000	831000	Morty asking Rick to make a love potion for the school dance causes the entire earth to be rendered so inhospitable that they have to abandon their universe entirely.
831000	841000	Many like to point to this moment as evidence of the show's nihilism by claiming that each world in Rick's multiverse matters so little that you could just throw it away and start over with a new one.
841000	849000	However, this event did matter. Morty is completely traumatized by this moment and never sees the world the same after this point.
849000	860000	Part of the reason Rick is so miserable is that he justifies his recklessness by saying that none of it matters, even though the consequences of his actions do affect him in very damaging ways.
860000	870000	Rick's prevailing character arc throughout the series is one of accountability, realizing that his actions do matter because of the consequences they bring to the people he cares about.
870000	874000	And no other episode represents this idea more than the season 2 finale.
874000	880000	This is the episode where Rick finally stops running from his problems and takes accountability for his actions.
880000	885000	In my opinion, this moment marks the point at which Rick and Morty peaked as a series.
885000	888000	Since this aired, the show has never really been the same.
888000	894000	After 2 years and 21 episodes, Rick and Morty was about to undergo some major changes.
900000	909000	But if you rearrange the letters in The Meaning of Life, it becomes the engine of a film.
909000	914000	Or, more pessimistically, the fine game of Nel.
914000	921000	Hello internet. Pickle Rick here and welcome to Cinema Hypothesis.
921000	931000	In today's episode, we're gonna get schwifty by finally solving the mystery, once and for all, of why Rick is really depressed.
931000	940000	Now, you could say that Rick's depression is caused by a variety of very obvious factors that anyone could understand by watching the show for more than 2 seconds.
940000	946000	But to be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to construct theories without evidence.
946000	954000	In season 1, episode 9 of Rick and Morty, the show reveals the hidden truth of why Rick can never be happy.
954000	961000	So, uh, as you can see in this shot, Rick is very clearly displaying the symptoms of male pattern baldness.
961000	965000	No! Oh jeez, he's crying.
965000	967000	Well, that's too bad for Rick.
967000	975000	If only there was an amazing scientific invention that was up to 90% effective at reducing and stopping the symptoms of hair loss.
975000	982000	This video is brought to you by Keeps Hair Loss Prevention, the most affordable FDA-approved hair loss product.
982000	987000	Talk to a real online doctor today to get your medication shipped right to your door.
987000	994000	And to think, Rick could have been happy all along if he just lived in the universe where he used Keeps to protect his hair.
994000	996000	Brain blast!
996000	1000000	However, to be fair, you have to have a very low follicle count to be a nihilist.
1000000	1007000	But hey, that's just a hypothesis. A cinema hypothesis!

1026000	1038000	The season 2 cliffhanger had generated more intrigue for the show than ever before.
1038000	1043000	For 18 months, fans speculated wild theories on what was going to happen next.
1043000	1047000	Then on April Fool's Day of 2017, we got our answer.
1047000	1050000	Welcome to the darkest year of our adventures.
1050000	1054000	The season 3 premiere was perhaps the boldest episode of the series.
1054000	1058000	Choosing to blow up the family entirely by having Beth divorce Jerry.
1058000	1063000	This change represented a major departure from the structure of the first two seasons.
1063000	1069000	But fans were riding high on the hype of the premiere and were excited to see where the story would go.
1069000	1073000	Two episodes later, we got the most infamous installment of the series.
1075000	1079000	I turned myself into a Pickle Morty! I'm Pickle Rick!
1080000	1085000	Pickle Rick was the first time that Rick and Morty truly divided the audience.
1085000	1090000	And to this day, it is still one of the most criticized episodes of the entire series.
1090000	1094000	Some viewers cite Pickle Rick as the moment Rick and Morty jumped the shark.
1094000	1098000	A point of no return from which the quality of the show never recovered.
1098000	1101000	So what went wrong with Pickle Rick?
1101000	1106000	A lot of people could tell that something was off about it but had a hard time articulating why.
1106000	1110000	Most people just know it as that episode with the annoying meme.
1110000	1113000	But the issues with the episode run far deeper.
1113000	1119000	In many ways, Pickle Rick betrayed the philosophy of the entire series up to that point.
1119000	1122000	It did so in three main aspects, starting with structure.
1122000	1127000	Rick and Morty would always portray its conflict through the lens of science fiction.
1127000	1133000	This left a lot of room for interpretation as the message of the show was never directly stated.
1133000	1140000	That all changed when Pickle Rick had Susan Sarandon literally explain to the audience how they're supposed to interpret the show.
1140000	1143000	There was nothing metaphorical or nuanced about it.
1143000	1149000	Just a regular human therapist on regular old earth telling the audience how they should feel.
1149000	1155000	I understand that the writers were trying something new, but this scene just came off as cheap.
1155000	1164000	After this moment, much of the open-ended mystique of Rick's character was extinguished and the series became less compelling as a result.
1164000	1171000	Speaking of Rick's character, this episode fundamentally alters the way in which Rick is written as a character moving forward.
1171000	1176000	For starters, Rick's power level from this point onward is completely absurd.
1176000	1180000	In the older seasons, Rick was savvy but still vulnerable.
1180000	1184000	Most of the time, all Rick could do was run away and escape through a portal.
1184000	1190000	The new seasons portray Rick as an invincible killing machine who can mow down enemies with ease.
1190000	1196000	This ruins the tension of all the action scenes because you know that Rick is no longer in any real danger.
1196000	1204000	Most of the time, he'll defeat his enemies in one second with an overpowered body augmentation that's never explained nor brought up again.
1204000	1210000	You know, maybe something like this could have come in handy that one time he got beat up and robbed by a teenage girl.
1210000	1217000	Rick's new unstoppable combat ability is emblematic of a far greater change in the overall presentation of the character.
1217000	1222000	Rick's whole character arc of accountability is more or less absent in season 3.
1222000	1228000	Somewhere along the way, Rick transformed from the flawed scientist to the smartest man in the universe.
1228000	1232000	The show only starts calling Rick this in season 3.
1232000	1238000	At no prior point did any other character refer to Rick as the smartest person in the universe.
1238000	1243000	I always thought that Rick was smart enough to see the universe in a more complex way,
1243000	1246000	but he wasn't an omnipotent god.
1246000	1249000	He was the smartest man in the universe.
1249000	1253000	I always thought that Rick was smart enough to see the universe in a more complex way,
1253000	1256000	but he wasn't an omnipotent god.
1256000	1261000	There were many other beings in the show whose powers far exceeded any of his capabilities.
1261000	1266000	But in the newer seasons, the whole universe seems to just exist as Rick's playing field.
1266000	1269000	When you know nothing matters, the universe is yours.
1269000	1272000	Smart people get a chance to climb on top, take reality for a ride.
1272000	1275000	This caused season 3 to feel very unbalanced.
1275000	1278000	This caused season 3 to feel very unbalanced.
1278000	1283000	There are far less heartfelt character moments and far more biting cynicism.
1283000	1286000	The show will introduce a thoughtful origin story about Rick
1286000	1291000	and then discard it two minutes later as a mere plot device to get Rick out of prison.
1291000	1296000	So was it real? Did it matter? Does anything in this season matter?
1296000	1301000	It was as if Rick's nihilism bled into the tone of the entire show.
1301000	1307000	From this point onward, most of the family members lose their defining characteristics to become more like Rick.
1307000	1311000	Limiting the nihilism to just a single character is fine,
1311000	1314000	but when the whole show is telling you that nothing matters,
1314000	1317000	then the audience have to ask themselves why the show matters.
1317000	1321000	I understand that this is supposed to be the darkest year of our adventures,
1321000	1325000	but season 3 doesn't feel dark as much as it feels aimless.
1325000	1329000	Rick and Morty was always dark. The show is a dark comedy.
1329000	1333000	Was it not dark when Morty got violated by King Jellybean,
1333000	1336000	or the multiple times Rick tried to end his own life?
1336000	1341000	Season 3 didn't add dark moments as much as it subtracted comedic ones.
1341000	1346000	Pickle Rick represents an unpleasant malaise that hangs over the whole season.
1346000	1350000	Characters stop developing. Consequences don't matter as much.
1350000	1354000	The family has very little to do because they spend the whole season separated,
1354000	1358000	only to just get back together at the end like nothing happened.
1358000	1362000	And by the way, you know, when you're telling these little stories, here's a good idea.
1362000	1364000	Have a point.
1364000	1370000	In my opinion, it would have been a lot more compelling if the series chose to separate Rick from the family instead of Jerry.
1370000	1374000	This would have shaken up the structure while still keeping Rick's character intact.
1374000	1380000	I get the feeling that this was the original plan for season 3, but they were too afraid to pull the trigger.
1380000	1385000	They needed to keep Rick as the straightforward face of the show because by the third season,
1385000	1387000	the series had become marketable.
1388000	1392000	You went into a store, an actual honest-to-God store, and you bought something.
1392000	1394000	Buy another one, Morty! Consume, Morty!
1394000	1398000	Pickle Rick was the final step in establishing the show as a trendy brand.
1398000	1405000	In the coming months, Pickle Rick would be plastered all over posters, merchandise, and other promotional material for the show.
1405000	1410000	I would describe this as the point in which Rick and Morty truly converged with the fandom.
1419000	1421000	Where's my sexual exhaust?
1421000	1423000	Pickle Rick!
1425000	1429000	If you find something entertaining, you can consider yourself a fan.
1429000	1436000	But when you allow the act of being a fan to take on a culture of its own, then you start to enter the fandom.
1436000	1443000	Fandoms in theory have always existed, but were never able to truly materialize until the advent of the internet.
1443000	1447000	Prior to the web, media was much more homogenous.
1447000	1453000	There was once a time when most Americans would all watch the same shows across the same three networks.
1453000	1459000	If I asked you to picture a Seinfeld fan, you probably couldn't come up with a definitive stereotype.
1459000	1467000	That's because shows like Seinfeld were so ubiquitous in pop culture that it's impossible to define it among a specific audience type.
1467000	1472000	The internet changed all of this by sparking a massive divergence in media programming.
1472000	1475000	The general audience was rendered obsolete.
1475000	1480000	Modern shows are increasingly catered towards more specific content preferences.
1480000	1486000	Rather than having a few shows watched by many people, we now have many shows watched by a few people.
1486000	1491000	Consequently, this has made it much harder to find people who watch the same shows as you.
1491000	1496000	But when you do find them, they're much more likely to have similar beliefs, attitudes, and interests.
1496000	1504000	The bifurcation of media has ushered in an unprecedented age where every show has its own community of like-minded viewers.
1504000	1511000	Welcome to the age of the fandom, where the media you consume is now fundamentally tied to your identity.
1511000	1516000	Engaging with a fandom is now part and parcel of enjoying any modern TV show.
1516000	1525000	Most fandoms are kept in check by the limited scope of their respective programming, but occasionally you'll see one that gets completely out of control.
1525000	1531000	Naturally, with Rick and Morty's meteoric rise in popularity, the fandom went completely mad.
1531000	1534000	Manic Antihero Attachment Disorder.
1534000	1543000	It's a psychiatric condition I just invented where a television viewer begins to idolize and emulate the flawed protagonist of their favorite show.
1543000	1552000	The Rick and Morty fandom is most well known for two infamous occurrences, the Szechuan sauce riots and the high IQ copypasta.
1552000	1560000	Although both of these events were somewhat over-embellished if not outright fake, they still cast a rather embarrassing shadow over the series as a whole.
1560000	1564000	It seemed like almost overnight Rick and Morty stopped being cool.
1564000	1573000	The fandom had caused the entire audience to be labeled as a bunch of snobby, pretentious pseudo-intellectuals or as a bunch of mindless consumer zombies.
1573000	1579000	This not only made people hate the show, but it made fans like me ashamed for enjoying the show.
1579000	1583000	Is it really fair to judge a show for the actions of its fandom?
1583000	1590000	Theoretically, we should be able to evaluate a piece of media in a vacuum regardless of the actions of its disciples.
1590000	1596000	But can a fandom become so insufferable that they damage their show's reputation beyond repair?
1596000	1600000	Obviously, it's the show that influences the fandom.
1600000	1604000	But what happens when the fandom starts to influence the show?
1604000	1606000	Well, you get Pickle Rick.
1606000	1614000	The fandom started calling Rick and Morty the smartest show on television, so the show became about the smartest man in the universe.
1614000	1619000	The fandom obsessed over the nihilist themes, so Rick and Morty became a nihilist show.
1619000	1625000	The fandom didn't care much about the family drama, so the family just sort of faded into the background.
1625000	1634000	It seems that somewhere along the way, the writers abandoned their original vision for the series to create a product more palatable for the fandom.
1634000	1637000	And the Emmy goes to...
1637000	1639000	Rick and Morty!
1639000	1644000	While I can't exactly say I blame the creators for doing this, Pickle Rick won the show an Emmy.
1644000	1649000	Rick and Morty undoubtedly succeeded at appealing to a trendier audience.
1649000	1651000	At least it did for a little bit.
1651000	1656000	You see, the problem with chasing trends is that they don't tend to stick around for very long.
1656000	1662000	As soon as the hype starts to cool off, the audience will leave you in a heartbeat to go play with the next shiny new toy.
1662000	1667000	Because trendy people don't stick around out of any intrinsic appreciation for the medium.
1667000	1670000	They only tune in because everyone else is doing it.
1670000	1677000	And unfortunately, in Rick and Morty's efforts to sustain their broad appeal, they have devalued their overall design aspects.
1677000	1681000	You really got in on that Game of Thrones fever. South Park did it four years ago, Morty.
1681000	1684000	If Ant-Man and the Wasp can do it, I'm not interested.
1684000	1685000	Gamer game?
1685000	1689000	I haven't seen blasts like this since Taco Night at James Earl Jones' house.
1689000	1693000	A dad makes a toilet look like R2-D2 and it breaks the front page of Reddit.
1693000	1697000	Nowadays, Rick will randomly name drop things like Reddit and Gamergate.
1697000	1701000	These references only exist to force a cheap pop from the audience.
1701000	1708000	It's difficult to separate the show from the fandom when the show will disrupt its own world building to specifically cater to them.
1708000	1716000	Am I supposed to believe that Rick, the universe-hopping interdimensional war criminal is concerned about the front page of Reddit?
1717000	1721000	Oh, you agree, huh? You like that Red Grin Grumbold reference?
1721000	1726000	Well, guess what? I made him up. You really are your father's children. Think for yourselves. Don't be sheep.
1726000	1731000	Much like the characters within the show, Rick and Morty is suffering from an identity crisis.
1731000	1735000	The show these days doesn't seem to have any definitive sense of direction.
1735000	1740000	They will introduce serialized elements, but won't pay them off in a satisfying way.
1740000	1748000	They portray Rick as a cocky, omniscient gladiator who always wins at everything, but still want us to feel sympathetic for his plight.
1748000	1757000	And as much as the show likes to rip on the media establishment, Rick and Morty is no longer the scrappy adult swim underdog. They're a dynasty.
1757000	1763000	The fan reaction to Pickle Rick I'll always have a fraud complex about because we teased it at Comic-Con.
1763000	1771000	And everybody that loves Rick and Morty knows that you have to wait really, really, really long periods of time.
1774000	1783000	It's hard to say what exactly caused Rick and Morty to stray so far from its original premise, but the change is most likely related to the staggered production of the third season.
1783000	1789000	Dan Harmon decided to hire four female writers to balance the gender ratio of the staff.
1789000	1797000	Some people use this to claim that women ruined the show, but I think adding four new writers of any gender would have still disrupted the show's momentum.
1797000	1805000	Writers need time to develop chemistry and I suspect that overhauling the team to this extent was more of a creative setback than they anticipated.
1805000	1811000	Season 3 experienced numerous delays and only managed to ship 10 of the 14 planned episodes.
1812000	1819000	Dan Harmon blamed the sluggish production on his perfectionism and newfound pressure to conform to grandiose standards.
1819000	1829000	Season 3 was intended to be the most ambitious yet, but they ended up biting off more than they could chew and the season wound up feeling sloppy, inconsistent and anticlimactic.
1829000	1834000	Part of the blame for the show's recent struggles can be placed on Adult Swim.
1834000	1841000	The network had never before managed a mainstream hit like Rick and Morty and seemed unprepared to handle the show's white-hot momentum.
1841000	1850000	Adult Swim followed up the belated release of Season 3 by leaving the show in limbo for eight months before finally ordering new episodes in May of 2018.
1850000	1860000	This pushed back the premiere of Season 4 to November of 2019 and for some baffling reason they decided to release the season in two halves five months apart.
1860000	1869000	It probably didn't help the production process that Justin Roiland was devoting much of his attention to an entirely new series that's basically just Rick and Morty with extra steps.
1869000	1877000	Between the Season 2 and Season 4 finale, Rick and Morty only managed to release 20 episodes in a four and a half year span.
1877000	1881000	Whatever hype there was for the show has long since been extinguished.
1881000	1884000	Rick and Morty had lightning in a bottle and they kind of blew it.
1884000	1889000	By the end of Season 4, more than half of the audience had stopped watching.
1890000	1896000	You ever wonder what happened to Rick and Morty?
1896000	1899000	Maybe it's for the best that Rick and Morty is no longer trendy.
1899000	1904000	Despite all the issues I just described, I still believe that Rick and Morty is a good show.
1904000	1911000	The new episodes are still entertaining to both watch and rewatch, which is more than I can say for almost anything else on television.
1911000	1915000	Rick and Morty is a good show, but it could have been a great show.
1915000	1920000	The magic of those first two seasons is something that may never be replicated again.
1920000	1926000	One has to wonder how the show could have turned out if they had stuck to their guns and shut out the noise from the fandom.
1926000	1932000	Regardless, Rick and Morty made the mistake of believing its own hype and now it has to face the consequences.
1932000	1935000	Right now the series is at a major crossroads.
1935000	1941000	The audience has diminished to Season 1 levels, so maybe it's a sign that the show should get back to basics.
1941000	1946000	Or maybe they could do the complete opposite and blow the show wide open with experimentation.
1946000	1951000	I've always admired how the show is never afraid to shake up the formula and keep things fresh.
1951000	1957000	Now that the hype has cooled off, the writers are no longer burdened by the wild expectations of a delusional fandom.
1957000	1964000	And as a mostly episodic series, they don't have to worry about pigeonholing each episode into a convoluted story.
1964000	1969000	Lots of people are writing the show off as dead, but I actually think that Rick and Morty could rise again.
1969000	1972000	Maybe because I'm not a massive nihilist.
1972000	1980000	People forget that other adult animated comedies like South Park and The Simpsons didn't come out with their best work until long after they peaked in popularity.
1980000	1982000	Maybe Rick and Morty can do the same.
1982000	1985000	Until then, we can at least look back at the good times.
1985000	1991000	I'll always remember staying up late on those Sunday nights knowing I'd have to drag myself to school the next morning.
1991000	1998000	And it was nice to forget about my problems for just half an hour and lose myself in a show unlike anything else on television.
1998000	2002000	It was a show that taught me a lot and made me see the world in a different way.
2002000	2008000	Then at some point, the show began to see itself in a different way, and both of us went on our own downward spiral.
2008000	2013000	Looking back on it all, both the show and I came out profoundly altered, for better or for worse.
2013000	2022000	I know it's a dumb meme, but that meme of like, to be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to understand Rick and Morty.
2022000	2030000	On one hand, that's emblematic of like, bad elements of fandom, but on the other hand, it does make me proud.
2030000	2039000	It's a show that is clearly loved by, among many other people, some of the most creative, funny, smart people available.
2039000	2045000	People like to rip on the insane Rick and Morty fandom, but ever since Season 2 ended, it's safe to say the whole world went a bit mad.
2045000	2050000	Will Season 5 come out before the imminent collapse of civilization?
2050000	2059000	We'll just have to wait and see, but as the universe around us continues to feel more dysfunctional and bleak, I'm glad I can at least find meaning in one cartoon on Adult Swim.
2059000	2066000	Everyone else can say whatever they want about it, but for me, Rick and Morty will always be a good show with a mad fandom.
2080000	2085000	Thanks for watching!
