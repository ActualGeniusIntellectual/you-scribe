1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
September 2013 saw the end of one of the greatest episodic comedies of all time as Futurama aired its final episode.

2
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:18,000
I was just a kid in high school at the time and my biggest pastime was turning on Comedy Central or Adult Swim and just grinding out homework late into the evening.

3
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,000
I'll always remember the end of Futurama as such a bittersweet moment.

4
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:29,000
We finally got to see the ultimate payoff of the series' 15-year long journey, but at the same time, this was the end.

5
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:35,000
No one was sure if there would ever be another show like it again. Fortunately for us, we didn't have to wait long.

6
00:00:35,000 --> 00:01:04,000
I remember it was around Thanksgiving when Adult Swim started airing the promos for Rick and Morty, a show that looked unlike anything the network had ever produced before.

7
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Adult Swim had always existed as a playground of artistic expression and creative experimentation.

8
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:17,000
It's a channel within a channel, allowing it to operate without the financial responsibilities of a major media network.

9
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:23,000
In the early days, Adult Swim mainly subsisted by syndicating canceled shows from the Fox network.

10
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:31,000
They had a small but loyal viewer base who were instrumental in convincing network executives to give shows like Futurama a second chance.

11
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:36,000
However, the most intriguing parts of Adult Swim can be found in their original programming.

12
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:43,000
For the longest time, Adult Swim originals were characterized by extremely crude, low-budget animation and avant-garde humor.

13
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Part of the charm of shows like Aqua Teen Hunger Force is that something so strange could exist on television at all.

14
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:58,000
This type of show earned Adult Swim the unofficial label of the Stoner's Paradise, but I don't think it's fair to define the network along this narrow premise.

15
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Adult Swim boldly greenlit shows that couldn't exist on any other network.

16
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:08,000
The Boondocks was a beautifully animated, brilliantly written show that offered cogent commentary on social issues.

17
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,000
But due to its narrow appeal, no other network wanted it.

18
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Adult Swim was the lone network who didn't care about marketability.

19
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:23,000
They handed artists the reins to present their vision, unfiltered and unneutered by a rigid obligation to appeasing corporate overlords.

20
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:27,000
In many ways, Rick and Morty was no different than any other Adult Swim show.

21
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:36,000
The origins of the show can be traced back to The Adventures of Doc and Marty, a crude parody of Back to the Future animated and voiced by Justin Roiland.

22
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:43,000
The webtoon was hosted on Channel 101, an online hub for experimental television hosted by comedian Dan Harmon.

23
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Years later, the animation would serve as the blueprint for Adult Swim's newest animated series.

24
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:52,000
And away we go!

25
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Wow! What happened back there?

26
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Why don't you ask the smartest people in the universe, Jerry?

27
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:16,000
If I could use one word to describe Rick and Morty, I'd say it's a very unique show.

28
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
There's nothing else like it on television.

29
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:23,000
It's an unholy combination of Futurama, Regular Show and Freddy Got Fingered.

30
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,000
The show is simultaneously crude and elegant.

31
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:31,000
It features both spontaneous improvisation and meticulous attention to detail.

32
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:37,000
It's impressive how the writers managed to create a show like this without it turning out completely incoherent.

33
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Historically, we have to look back on Rick and Morty as one of the most culturally significant shows of its decade.

34
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Perhaps no other show connected more with the zeitgeist of the 2010s.

35
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:53,000
It wasn't just entertaining. It captured the hearts and minds of a generation of young adults.

36
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Rick and Morty encompasses the search for meaning in an age of aimlessness and cynicism.

37
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:02,000
It's not just a show about an anti-hero. It's an anti-show.

38
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Morty, what did you do? You killed the Simpsons, Morty!

39
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Nearly every aspect of the show is designed to subvert the platitudes of conventional media.

40
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,000
It's a sitcom where nothing ever goes back to normal.

41
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:19,000
The characters occupy a wacky, cartoony world but suffer realistic, gruesome consequences.

42
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:26,000
The writers will intentionally disrupt a sappy emotional moment with a goofy fourth wall break that obliterates any tension in the scene.

43
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:31,000
This sardonic tongue-in-cheek deprecation is something that could have only succeeded in the internet age.

44
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
And succeed it did.

45
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Rick and Morty's first season premiered to an audience of one million viewers.

46
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:40,000
By the season finale, the audience had effectively doubled.

47
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:45,000
For the first time ever, people were going out of their way to tune into Adult Swim on Sunday nights.

48
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:51,000
New episodes would generate widespread discussion, memes and theories on forums across the web.

49
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:56,000
It was not uncommon at this time to get millions of views on YouTube videos just talking about the show.

50
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Rick and Morty was a hit with both casual viewers and critics.

51
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:05,000
At one point peaking at number seven on IMDb's top 250 TV shows.

52
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:11,000
On paper it appears to be not just one of the greatest shows of its time, but one of the greatest of all time.

53
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:19,000
And yet when you ask people their opinion on the show today, you'll find that the responses are much more polarizing than the critical consensus would have you believe.

54
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:24,000
It seems you can't mention the show online anymore without sparking a vicious debate.

55
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Nowadays there are lots of people who say the show went downhill.

56
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Some say that the show was never good in the first place.

57
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:38,000
I remember a time when the show was universally revered, but somewhere along the way something went very, very wrong.

58
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:44,000
In order to understand what made people hate Rick and Morty, we have to understand what made people love Rick and Morty.

59
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Well, what do you love about Rick and Morty?

60
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Most people would say that they watch Rick and Morty to see two dudes go on wacky sci-fi adventures.

61
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Many like to praise the clever and shocking comedy.

62
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Some find the crude improvised moments charming.

63
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Others relate to the show's nihilist overtones and appreciate its commentary on the nature of society.

64
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:16,000
A lot of people became invested in the lore and world building and keep watching to see where the story goes next.

65
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:25,000
All of these are valid reasons to like the show, but if you ask me, a lot of people overlook the one element that truly makes Rick and Morty click.

66
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Ask yourself this, what is Rick and Morty about?

67
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:38,000
You could come up with a million answers to this question, but ultimately at its core, Rick and Morty is a show about a dysfunctional family.

68
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:44,000
More specifically, Rick and Morty is a show about how a dysfunctional family deals with identity.

69
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Coming of age, belonging, wasted potential, mediocrity and loneliness.

70
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:54,000
These are all prevailing conflicts embodied by each member of the Smith family.

71
00:06:54,000 --> 00:07:01,000
I initially compared Rick and Morty to Futurama, but it thematically has much more in common with The Simpsons.

72
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:10,000
At a superficial level, you could describe Rick and Morty as a sci-fi comedy, but at a conceptual level, the show is much closer to a family drama.

73
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:16,000
This is the thematic engine which drives the characters, the story and the philosophy of the show.

74
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:22,000
But don't just take my word for it, the answer was hiding in plain sight all along from the very beginning.

75
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Don't swim.

76
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
Cover me.

77
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Science makes sense.

78
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Family doesn't.

79
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Unfortunately, I feel like most of the audience have fundamentally misunderstood the overall conceit of the show, choosing instead to focus on the far more bombastic sci-fi elements.

80
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Much of the controversy around the show today can be attributed to the audience basing their expectations around a sci-fi adventure rather than a family drama.

81
00:07:55,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Early on, this led to numerous articles ordaining Rick and Morty the smartest show on television.

82
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:08,000
This ultimately caused people to assign tremendous scientific and philosophical weight towards nonsensical aspects of the show.

83
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:13,000
You had people trying to dissect the greater intellectual meaning behind Mr. Poopy Butthole.

84
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Rick and Morty is a very clever show, but most of the science presented by the show is more or less arbitrary.

85
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Futurama was a show that was far more realistic in its portrayal of scientific concepts.

86
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:31,000
One time, Ken Keeler even presented an original mathematical proof in the form of an episode.

87
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:37,000
But simply being a smart show is not enough to carry a piece of media to transcendent popularity.

88
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Science fiction has always existed as the awkward nerdy sibling to its far more popular counterpart, fantasy.

89
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:51,000
It's difficult to engage audiences with science fiction when most people don't even have a basic understanding of science.

90
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:59,000
This often leads to science fiction feeling sterile and esoteric as they alienate general audiences with complex scientific jargon.

91
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:05,000
In order to make sci-fi more approachable, you have to add in a grounded element that the average person can relate to.

92
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:13,000
For Futurama, this comes in the form of the everyman fry, the search for purpose and fitting into an alien world.

93
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:17,000
These are somewhat universal themes that everyone can understand.

94
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Star Wars and Star Trek were both synonymous with sci-fi in the 20th century.

95
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:31,000
One of these franchises exploded as an ubiquitous cultural behemoth, while the other is still generally regarded as a niche nerdy subculture.

96
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:37,000
The difference is that Star Wars had more simple and relatable elements to help people engage with the story.

97
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:42,000
On paper, the Star Wars saga is about an epic space adventure.

98
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:47,000
But at its core, Star Wars simply tells the story of a dysfunctional family.

99
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:57,000
Likewise, Rick and Morty is the story of a dysfunctional family told through the lens of science fiction.

100
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:02,000
The show uses science fiction as a means to explore the dynamics of family drama.

101
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:09,000
Nearly all sci-fi concepts in the show only serve to accent the internal conflict among family members.

102
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:12,000
The Meeseeks box represents the family's insecurities.

103
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Interdimensional cable explores choices and consequences.

104
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:25,000
The entire multiverse serves as an allegory for Rick's inability to confront his personal demons, choosing instead to run away and forget about them.

105
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:31,000
The show tends to focus on Rick more than anyone else because he is the most flawed character.

106
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:34,000
Morty, do you know what wubba lubba dub dub means?

107
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:37,000
Uh, that's just Rick's stupid nonsense catchphrase.

108
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:43,000
It's not nonsense at all. In my people's tongue, it means, I am in great pain. Please help me.

109
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:55,000
Lots of people have interpreted Rick's character as the embodiment of nihilism and have used this idea to define Rick and Morty as a nihilist show.

110
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:01,000
I would actually argue that Rick's early characterization serves as a warning against nihilism.

111
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:08,000
On the surface, Rick appears to be an aloof renegade who is too smart to care about the universe's problems.

112
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:20,000
However, the more you watch, the more you realize that Rick's unparalleled intellect has left him profoundly lonely.

113
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:32,000
He must keep himself constantly inebriated in order to shield himself from the harsh realities of existence.

114
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:40,000
Rick is terrified by the fact that no matter how smart he is, he will never be able to truly escape his human flaws.

115
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:43,000
Because to be human is to be irrational.

116
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:47,000
There is no empirical scientific reason to care about others.

117
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:54,000
You could live your whole life simply exploiting the goodwill of your peers like they're a dispensable resource and it wouldn't make a difference.

118
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:57,000
The nihilist side of Rick wants him to do just that.

119
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:02,000
We both know that if there's any truth in the universe, it's that Ricks don't care about Mortys.

120
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:06,000
But deep down, he really does care about certain people, his family.

121
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:12,000
Rick's overwhelmingly logical mind forces him to treat the universe with a nihilist outlook.

122
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:15,000
But in doing so, he loses his humanity.

123
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:18,000
Break the cycle, Morty. Rise above. Focus on science.

124
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:26,000
Using science, Rick can invent anything he wants, yet he remains unable to form a meaningful connection with anyone in the universe.

125
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:29,000
Not even with identical versions of himself.

126
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:34,000
Rick's characterization provides nuanced commentary about the nature of human progress.

127
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:41,000
As our civilization becomes more technologically advanced, are we losing touch with what makes us human?

128
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:49,000
Why does it feel like despite existing in the smartest era of human history, people are more miserable today than ever before?

129
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:53,000
There's a jaded wisdom to Rick and Morty that's oddly uplifting at times.

130
00:12:53,000 --> 00:13:02,000
The show won't hold back at acknowledging the painful brutality that life has to offer, but it provides consolation for why you shouldn't just quit.

131
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:10,000
The philosophy of Rick and Morty is less about wallowing in the bleak moments of life, but rather salvaging meaning from those bleak moments.

132
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:16,000
Do I agree with Rick that nothing means anything? No, I do not.

133
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:22,000
Because the knowledge that nothing matters, while accurate, gets you nowhere.

134
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:31,000
A prevailing theme of the early seasons is that even at your lowest point, your decisions still do matter.

135
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:35,000
Rick and Morty makes this apparent through the importance of consequences.

136
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:41,000
It's a show where minor mistakes can cause long-lasting and permanent damage to the characters and world.

137
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:51,000
Morty asking Rick to make a love potion for the school dance causes the entire earth to be rendered so inhospitable that they have to abandon their universe entirely.

138
00:13:51,000 --> 00:14:01,000
Many like to point to this moment as evidence of the show's nihilism by claiming that each world in Rick's multiverse matters so little that you could just throw it away and start over with a new one.

139
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:09,000
However, this event did matter. Morty is completely traumatized by this moment and never sees the world the same after this point.

140
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:20,000
Part of the reason Rick is so miserable is that he justifies his recklessness by saying that none of it matters, even though the consequences of his actions do affect him in very damaging ways.

141
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:30,000
Rick's prevailing character arc throughout the series is one of accountability, realizing that his actions do matter because of the consequences they bring to the people he cares about.

142
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:34,000
And no other episode represents this idea more than the season 2 finale.

143
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:40,000
This is the episode where Rick finally stops running from his problems and takes accountability for his actions.

144
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:45,000
In my opinion, this moment marks the point at which Rick and Morty peaked as a series.

145
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:48,000
Since this aired, the show has never really been the same.

146
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:54,000
After 2 years and 21 episodes, Rick and Morty was about to undergo some major changes.

147
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:09,000
But if you rearrange the letters in The Meaning of Life, it becomes the engine of a film.

148
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:14,000
Or, more pessimistically, the fine game of Nel.

149
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:21,000
Hello internet. Pickle Rick here and welcome to Cinema Hypothesis.

150
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:31,000
In today's episode, we're gonna get schwifty by finally solving the mystery, once and for all, of why Rick is really depressed.

151
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:40,000
Now, you could say that Rick's depression is caused by a variety of very obvious factors that anyone could understand by watching the show for more than 2 seconds.

152
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:46,000
But to be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to construct theories without evidence.

153
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:54,000
In season 1, episode 9 of Rick and Morty, the show reveals the hidden truth of why Rick can never be happy.

154
00:15:54,000 --> 00:16:01,000
So, uh, as you can see in this shot, Rick is very clearly displaying the symptoms of male pattern baldness.

155
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:05,000
No! Oh jeez, he's crying.

156
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,000
Well, that's too bad for Rick.

157
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:15,000
If only there was an amazing scientific invention that was up to 90% effective at reducing and stopping the symptoms of hair loss.

158
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:22,000
This video is brought to you by Keeps Hair Loss Prevention, the most affordable FDA-approved hair loss product.

160
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:34,000
And to think, Rick could have been happy all along if he just lived in the universe where he used Keeps to protect his hair.

161
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
Brain blast!

162
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:40,000
However, to be fair, you have to have a very low follicle count to be a nihilist.

163
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:47,000
But hey, that's just a hypothesis. A cinema hypothesis!

164
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:52,000
Stay tuned for next time when we uncover the mystery of Jerry's erectile dysfunction.

167
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:18,000
The season 2 cliffhanger had generated more intrigue for the show than ever before.

168
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:23,000
For 18 months, fans speculated wild theories on what was going to happen next.

169
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:27,000
Then on April Fool's Day of 2017, we got our answer.

170
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:30,000
Welcome to the darkest year of our adventures.

171
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:34,000
The season 3 premiere was perhaps the boldest episode of the series.

172
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:38,000
Choosing to blow up the family entirely by having Beth divorce Jerry.

173
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:43,000
This change represented a major departure from the structure of the first two seasons.

174
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:49,000
But fans were riding high on the hype of the premiere and were excited to see where the story would go.

175
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:53,000
Two episodes later, we got the most infamous installment of the series.

176
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:59,000
I turned myself into a Pickle Morty! I'm Pickle Rick!

177
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:05,000
Pickle Rick was the first time that Rick and Morty truly divided the audience.

178
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:10,000
And to this day, it is still one of the most criticized episodes of the entire series.

179
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:14,000
Some viewers cite Pickle Rick as the moment Rick and Morty jumped the shark.

180
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:18,000
A point of no return from which the quality of the show never recovered.

181
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:21,000
So what went wrong with Pickle Rick?

182
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:26,000
A lot of people could tell that something was off about it but had a hard time articulating why.

183
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:30,000
Most people just know it as that episode with the annoying meme.

184
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:33,000
But the issues with the episode run far deeper.

185
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:39,000
In many ways, Pickle Rick betrayed the philosophy of the entire series up to that point.

186
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:42,000
It did so in three main aspects, starting with structure.

187
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:47,000
Rick and Morty would always portray its conflict through the lens of science fiction.

188
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:53,000
This left a lot of room for interpretation as the message of the show was never directly stated.

189
00:18:53,000 --> 00:19:00,000
That all changed when Pickle Rick had Susan Sarandon literally explain to the audience how they're supposed to interpret the show.

190
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:03,000
There was nothing metaphorical or nuanced about it.

191
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:09,000
Just a regular human therapist on regular old earth telling the audience how they should feel.

192
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:15,000
I understand that the writers were trying something new, but this scene just came off as cheap.

193
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:24,000
After this moment, much of the open-ended mystique of Rick's character was extinguished and the series became less compelling as a result.

194
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:31,000
Speaking of Rick's character, this episode fundamentally alters the way in which Rick is written as a character moving forward.

195
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:36,000
For starters, Rick's power level from this point onward is completely absurd.

196
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:40,000
In the older seasons, Rick was savvy but still vulnerable.

197
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:44,000
Most of the time, all Rick could do was run away and escape through a portal.

198
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:50,000
The new seasons portray Rick as an invincible killing machine who can mow down enemies with ease.

199
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:56,000
This ruins the tension of all the action scenes because you know that Rick is no longer in any real danger.

200
00:19:56,000 --> 00:20:04,000
Most of the time, he'll defeat his enemies in one second with an overpowered body augmentation that's never explained nor brought up again.

201
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:10,000
You know, maybe something like this could have come in handy that one time he got beat up and robbed by a teenage girl.

202
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:17,000
Rick's new unstoppable combat ability is emblematic of a far greater change in the overall presentation of the character.

203
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:22,000
Rick's whole character arc of accountability is more or less absent in season 3.

204
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:28,000
Somewhere along the way, Rick transformed from the flawed scientist to the smartest man in the universe.

205
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:32,000
The show only starts calling Rick this in season 3.

206
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:38,000
At no prior point did any other character refer to Rick as the smartest person in the universe.

207
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:43,000
I always thought that Rick was smart enough to see the universe in a more complex way,

208
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:46,000
but he wasn't an omnipotent god.

209
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:49,000
He was the smartest man in the universe.

210
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:53,000
I always thought that Rick was smart enough to see the universe in a more complex way,

211
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:56,000
but he wasn't an omnipotent god.

212
00:20:56,000 --> 00:21:01,000
There were many other beings in the show whose powers far exceeded any of his capabilities.

213
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:06,000
But in the newer seasons, the whole universe seems to just exist as Rick's playing field.

214
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:09,000
When you know nothing matters, the universe is yours.

215
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:12,000
Smart people get a chance to climb on top, take reality for a ride.

216
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:15,000
This caused season 3 to feel very unbalanced.

217
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:18,000
This caused season 3 to feel very unbalanced.

218
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:23,000
There are far less heartfelt character moments and far more biting cynicism.

219
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:26,000
The show will introduce a thoughtful origin story about Rick

220
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:31,000
and then discard it two minutes later as a mere plot device to get Rick out of prison.

221
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:36,000
So was it real? Did it matter? Does anything in this season matter?

222
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:41,000
It was as if Rick's nihilism bled into the tone of the entire show.

223
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:47,000
From this point onward, most of the family members lose their defining characteristics to become more like Rick.

224
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:51,000
Limiting the nihilism to just a single character is fine,

225
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:54,000
but when the whole show is telling you that nothing matters,

226
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:57,000
then the audience have to ask themselves why the show matters.

227
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:01,000
I understand that this is supposed to be the darkest year of our adventures,

228
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:05,000
but season 3 doesn't feel dark as much as it feels aimless.

229
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:09,000
Rick and Morty was always dark. The show is a dark comedy.

230
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:13,000
Was it not dark when Morty got violated by King Jellybean,

231
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:16,000
or the multiple times Rick tried to end his own life?

232
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:21,000
Season 3 didn't add dark moments as much as it subtracted comedic ones.

233
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:26,000
Pickle Rick represents an unpleasant malaise that hangs over the whole season.

234
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:30,000
Characters stop developing. Consequences don't matter as much.

235
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:34,000
The family has very little to do because they spend the whole season separated,

236
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:38,000
only to just get back together at the end like nothing happened.

237
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:42,000
And by the way, you know, when you're telling these little stories, here's a good idea.

238
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,000
Have a point.

239
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:50,000
In my opinion, it would have been a lot more compelling if the series chose to separate Rick from the family instead of Jerry.

240
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:54,000
This would have shaken up the structure while still keeping Rick's character intact.

241
00:22:54,000 --> 00:23:00,000
I get the feeling that this was the original plan for season 3, but they were too afraid to pull the trigger.

242
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:05,000
They needed to keep Rick as the straightforward face of the show because by the third season,

243
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,000
the series had become marketable.

244
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:12,000
You went into a store, an actual honest-to-God store, and you bought something.

245
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,000
Buy another one, Morty! Consume, Morty!

246
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:18,000
Pickle Rick was the final step in establishing the show as a trendy brand.

247
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:25,000
In the coming months, Pickle Rick would be plastered all over posters, merchandise, and other promotional material for the show.

248
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:30,000
I would describe this as the point in which Rick and Morty truly converged with the fandom.

249
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,000
Where's my sexual exhaust?

250
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:43,000
Pickle Rick!

251
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:49,000
If you find something entertaining, you can consider yourself a fan.

252
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:56,000
But when you allow the act of being a fan to take on a culture of its own, then you start to enter the fandom.

253
00:23:56,000 --> 00:24:03,000
Fandoms in theory have always existed, but were never able to truly materialize until the advent of the internet.

254
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:07,000
Prior to the web, media was much more homogenous.

255
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:13,000
There was once a time when most Americans would all watch the same shows across the same three networks.

256
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:19,000
If I asked you to picture a Seinfeld fan, you probably couldn't come up with a definitive stereotype.

257
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:27,000
That's because shows like Seinfeld were so ubiquitous in pop culture that it's impossible to define it among a specific audience type.

258
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:32,000
The internet changed all of this by sparking a massive divergence in media programming.

259
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:35,000
The general audience was rendered obsolete.

260
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:40,000
Modern shows are increasingly catered towards more specific content preferences.

261
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:46,000
Rather than having a few shows watched by many people, we now have many shows watched by a few people.

262
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:51,000
Consequently, this has made it much harder to find people who watch the same shows as you.

263
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:56,000
But when you do find them, they're much more likely to have similar beliefs, attitudes, and interests.

264
00:24:56,000 --> 00:25:04,000
The bifurcation of media has ushered in an unprecedented age where every show has its own community of like-minded viewers.

265
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:11,000
Welcome to the age of the fandom, where the media you consume is now fundamentally tied to your identity.

266
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:16,000
Engaging with a fandom is now part and parcel of enjoying any modern TV show.

267
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:25,000
Most fandoms are kept in check by the limited scope of their respective programming, but occasionally you'll see one that gets completely out of control.

268
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:31,000
Naturally, with Rick and Morty's meteoric rise in popularity, the fandom went completely mad.

269
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:34,000
Manic Antihero Attachment Disorder.

270
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:43,000
It's a psychiatric condition I just invented where a television viewer begins to idolize and emulate the flawed protagonist of their favorite show.

271
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:52,000
The Rick and Morty fandom is most well known for two infamous occurrences, the Szechuan sauce riots and the high IQ copypasta.

272
00:25:52,000 --> 00:26:00,000
Although both of these events were somewhat over-embellished if not outright fake, they still cast a rather embarrassing shadow over the series as a whole.

273
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:04,000
It seemed like almost overnight Rick and Morty stopped being cool.

274
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:13,000
The fandom had caused the entire audience to be labeled as a bunch of snobby, pretentious pseudo-intellectuals or as a bunch of mindless consumer zombies.

275
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:19,000
This not only made people hate the show, but it made fans like me ashamed for enjoying the show.

276
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:23,000
Is it really fair to judge a show for the actions of its fandom?

277
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:30,000
Theoretically, we should be able to evaluate a piece of media in a vacuum regardless of the actions of its disciples.

278
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:36,000
But can a fandom become so insufferable that they damage their show's reputation beyond repair?

279
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:40,000
Obviously, it's the show that influences the fandom.

280
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:44,000
But what happens when the fandom starts to influence the show?

281
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,000
Well, you get Pickle Rick.

282
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:54,000
The fandom started calling Rick and Morty the smartest show on television, so the show became about the smartest man in the universe.

283
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:59,000
The fandom obsessed over the nihilist themes, so Rick and Morty became a nihilist show.

284
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:05,000
The fandom didn't care much about the family drama, so the family just sort of faded into the background.

285
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:14,000
It seems that somewhere along the way, the writers abandoned their original vision for the series to create a product more palatable for the fandom.

286
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:17,000
And the Emmy goes to...

287
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:19,000
Rick and Morty!

288
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:24,000
While I can't exactly say I blame the creators for doing this, Pickle Rick won the show an Emmy.

289
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:29,000
Rick and Morty undoubtedly succeeded at appealing to a trendier audience.

290
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:31,000
At least it did for a little bit.

291
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:36,000
You see, the problem with chasing trends is that they don't tend to stick around for very long.

292
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:42,000
As soon as the hype starts to cool off, the audience will leave you in a heartbeat to go play with the next shiny new toy.

293
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:47,000
Because trendy people don't stick around out of any intrinsic appreciation for the medium.

294
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:50,000
They only tune in because everyone else is doing it.

295
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:57,000
And unfortunately, in Rick and Morty's efforts to sustain their broad appeal, they have devalued their overall design aspects.

296
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:01,000
You really got in on that Game of Thrones fever. South Park did it four years ago, Morty.

297
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:04,000
If Ant-Man and the Wasp can do it, I'm not interested.

298
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:05,000
Gamer game?

299
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:09,000
I haven't seen blasts like this since Taco Night at James Earl Jones' house.

300
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:13,000
A dad makes a toilet look like R2-D2 and it breaks the front page of Reddit.

301
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:17,000
Nowadays, Rick will randomly name drop things like Reddit and Gamergate.

302
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:21,000
These references only exist to force a cheap pop from the audience.

303
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:28,000
It's difficult to separate the show from the fandom when the show will disrupt its own world building to specifically cater to them.

304
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:36,000
Am I supposed to believe that Rick, the universe-hopping interdimensional war criminal is concerned about the front page of Reddit?

305
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:41,000
Oh, you agree, huh? You like that Red Grin Grumbold reference?

306
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:46,000
Well, guess what? I made him up. You really are your father's children. Think for yourselves. Don't be sheep.

307
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:51,000
Much like the characters within the show, Rick and Morty is suffering from an identity crisis.

308
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:55,000
The show these days doesn't seem to have any definitive sense of direction.

309
00:28:55,000 --> 00:29:00,000
They will introduce serialized elements, but won't pay them off in a satisfying way.

310
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:08,000
They portray Rick as a cocky, omniscient gladiator who always wins at everything, but still want us to feel sympathetic for his plight.

311
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:17,000
And as much as the show likes to rip on the media establishment, Rick and Morty is no longer the scrappy adult swim underdog. They're a dynasty.

312
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:23,000
The fan reaction to Pickle Rick I'll always have a fraud complex about because we teased it at Comic-Con.

313
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:31,000
And everybody that loves Rick and Morty knows that you have to wait really, really, really long periods of time.

314
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:43,000
It's hard to say what exactly caused Rick and Morty to stray so far from its original premise, but the change is most likely related to the staggered production of the third season.

315
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:49,000
Dan Harmon decided to hire four female writers to balance the gender ratio of the staff.

316
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:57,000
Some people use this to claim that women ruined the show, but I think adding four new writers of any gender would have still disrupted the show's momentum.

317
00:29:57,000 --> 00:30:05,000
Writers need time to develop chemistry and I suspect that overhauling the team to this extent was more of a creative setback than they anticipated.

318
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:11,000
Season 3 experienced numerous delays and only managed to ship 10 of the 14 planned episodes.

319
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:19,000
Dan Harmon blamed the sluggish production on his perfectionism and newfound pressure to conform to grandiose standards.

320
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:29,000
Season 3 was intended to be the most ambitious yet, but they ended up biting off more than they could chew and the season wound up feeling sloppy, inconsistent and anticlimactic.

321
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:34,000
Part of the blame for the show's recent struggles can be placed on Adult Swim.

322
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:41,000
The network had never before managed a mainstream hit like Rick and Morty and seemed unprepared to handle the show's white-hot momentum.

323
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:50,000
Adult Swim followed up the belated release of Season 3 by leaving the show in limbo for eight months before finally ordering new episodes in May of 2018.

324
00:30:50,000 --> 00:31:00,000
This pushed back the premiere of Season 4 to November of 2019 and for some baffling reason they decided to release the season in two halves five months apart.

325
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:09,000
It probably didn't help the production process that Justin Roiland was devoting much of his attention to an entirely new series that's basically just Rick and Morty with extra steps.

326
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:17,000
Between the Season 2 and Season 4 finale, Rick and Morty only managed to release 20 episodes in a four and a half year span.

327
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:21,000
Whatever hype there was for the show has long since been extinguished.

328
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:24,000
Rick and Morty had lightning in a bottle and they kind of blew it.

329
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:29,000
By the end of Season 4, more than half of the audience had stopped watching.

330
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:36,000
You ever wonder what happened to Rick and Morty?

331
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:39,000
Maybe it's for the best that Rick and Morty is no longer trendy.

332
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:44,000
Despite all the issues I just described, I still believe that Rick and Morty is a good show.

333
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:51,000
The new episodes are still entertaining to both watch and rewatch, which is more than I can say for almost anything else on television.

334
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:55,000
Rick and Morty is a good show, but it could have been a great show.

335
00:31:55,000 --> 00:32:00,000
The magic of those first two seasons is something that may never be replicated again.

336
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:06,000
One has to wonder how the show could have turned out if they had stuck to their guns and shut out the noise from the fandom.

337
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:12,000
Regardless, Rick and Morty made the mistake of believing its own hype and now it has to face the consequences.

338
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:15,000
Right now the series is at a major crossroads.

339
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:21,000
The audience has diminished to Season 1 levels, so maybe it's a sign that the show should get back to basics.

340
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:26,000
Or maybe they could do the complete opposite and blow the show wide open with experimentation.

341
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:31,000
I've always admired how the show is never afraid to shake up the formula and keep things fresh.

342
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:37,000
Now that the hype has cooled off, the writers are no longer burdened by the wild expectations of a delusional fandom.

343
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:44,000
And as a mostly episodic series, they don't have to worry about pigeonholing each episode into a convoluted story.

344
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:49,000
Lots of people are writing the show off as dead, but I actually think that Rick and Morty could rise again.

345
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:52,000
Maybe because I'm not a massive nihilist.

346
00:32:52,000 --> 00:33:00,000
People forget that other adult animated comedies like South Park and The Simpsons didn't come out with their best work until long after they peaked in popularity.

347
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,000
Maybe Rick and Morty can do the same.

348
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:05,000
Until then, we can at least look back at the good times.

349
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:11,000
I'll always remember staying up late on those Sunday nights knowing I'd have to drag myself to school the next morning.

350
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:18,000
And it was nice to forget about my problems for just half an hour and lose myself in a show unlike anything else on television.

351
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:22,000
It was a show that taught me a lot and made me see the world in a different way.

352
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:28,000
Then at some point, the show began to see itself in a different way, and both of us went on our own downward spiral.

353
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:33,000
Looking back on it all, both the show and I came out profoundly altered, for better or for worse.

354
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:42,000
I know it's a dumb meme, but that meme of like, to be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to understand Rick and Morty.

355
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:50,000
On one hand, that's emblematic of like, bad elements of fandom, but on the other hand, it does make me proud.

356
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:59,000
It's a show that is clearly loved by, among many other people, some of the most creative, funny, smart people available.

357
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:05,000
People like to rip on the insane Rick and Morty fandom, but ever since Season 2 ended, it's safe to say the whole world went a bit mad.

358
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:10,000
Will Season 5 come out before the imminent collapse of civilization?

359
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:19,000
We'll just have to wait and see, but as the universe around us continues to feel more dysfunctional and bleak, I'm glad I can at least find meaning in one cartoon on Adult Swim.

360
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:26,000
Everyone else can say whatever they want about it, but for me, Rick and Morty will always be a good show with a mad fandom.

361
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:45,000
Thanks for watching!
