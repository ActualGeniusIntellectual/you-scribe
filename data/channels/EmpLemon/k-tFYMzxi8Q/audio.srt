1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:13,920
Is it just me, or do movies these days feel… artificial?

2
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:18,800
And I'm not just referring to unconvincing acting or graphical shortcomings, I'm talking

3
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:25,180
about the whole experience, from beginning to end.

4
00:00:25,180 --> 00:00:29,500
On the surface, the Hollywood blockbusters of today still look and sound like they used

5
00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:30,500
to.

6
00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:34,500
And if you're watching them half asleep or drunk, you may not be able to tell that

7
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:36,980
anything has changed at all.

8
00:00:36,980 --> 00:00:37,980
But I don't know.

9
00:00:37,980 --> 00:00:42,060
There's something about movies today that just feels… off.

10
00:00:42,060 --> 00:00:43,940
Like they're missing something.

11
00:00:43,940 --> 00:00:52,020
And while I don't know exactly when it began, I do know when I started feeling it.

12
00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:56,600
Growing up in the 2000s, it seemed like every kid had a favorite franchise, whether it was

13
00:00:56,600 --> 00:01:00,660
Harry Potter, Lord of the Rings, Yu-Gi-Oh!, Bionicle.

14
00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:05,900
But for me, the fantasy world I called home would be found in a galaxy far, far away.

15
00:01:05,900 --> 00:01:11,900
It may not be possible to describe just how big of a deal Star Wars was when I was younger.

16
00:01:11,900 --> 00:01:17,240
The brand was in the midst of a cultural revival for a new generation, my generation.

17
00:01:17,240 --> 00:01:22,240
The fanfare was practically inescapable, and boy did I get caught up in it.

18
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:28,200
My first taste came from the Lego Star Wars video game, and the rest was history.

19
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:32,720
Star Wars became the first fictional universe in which I was truly engrossed.

20
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:36,440
Studying the characters and lore became a personal obsession.

21
00:01:36,440 --> 00:01:40,240
It got to the point where simply seeing a dude with a glowing stick was enough to get

22
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:41,520
me excited.

23
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:44,280
And I was far from the only one to feel this way.

24
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:49,160
It's impossible to truly describe just how much of a cultural phenomenon Star Wars was

25
00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:55,800
at this time, and unlike many such events today, it never came off as forced or contrived.

26
00:01:55,800 --> 00:02:00,320
The intense passion around the series came from a place of genuine reverence, one that

27
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:03,400
transcended space and time.

28
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:08,520
These days boomers and zoomers aren't exactly known to get along, but for a brief period

29
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:11,320
Star Wars managed to bring us together.

30
00:02:11,320 --> 00:02:16,240
I still have fond memories of watching the original trilogy with my dad, and recognizing

31
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:19,480
that it was a meaningful experience for both of us.

32
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:25,160
I figured that one day, I would be able to pass on a cherished trilogy of my own.

33
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:31,280
Unfortunately, like most things in the modern age, it came with a catch.

34
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:36,080
It turned out that the new batch of Star Wars films didn't quite stack up to the originals,

35
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:39,040
and that George Lucas may have gone too far in a few places.

36
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:41,840
I may have gone too far in a few places.

37
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:46,520
As time went on, I began to realize just how flawed the prequels were.

38
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:51,280
Despite my overwhelming love for the franchise, I couldn't ignore the sinking feeling that

39
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:53,000
I'd been shortchanged.

40
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:58,440
I mean after all, for as pervasive as the Star Wars brand was, at the end of the day

41
00:02:58,440 --> 00:03:01,780
it all depended on the success of the movies.

42
00:03:01,780 --> 00:03:07,400
So with that being said, is it too much to ask for the movies to be, I don't know, good?

43
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:11,800
Passion and hype can only get you so far.

44
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:16,320
At some point, the underlying product has to be something worth celebrating.

45
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:22,240
It's tough to justify being a fan of a franchise when half the films are downright mediocre.

46
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:28,240
But no worries, Disney has come to save the day from that washed up hack, George Lucas.

47
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:30,400
Just look at how they turned around Marvel.

48
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:32,720
This thing is going to be a slam dunk.

49
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:37,180
They're going to come in, kick some ass, and make their own trilogy the right way.

50
00:03:37,180 --> 00:03:41,880
And we can just go ahead and pretend that whole prequel fiasco never happened.

51
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:46,540
At long last, Star Wars is going to produce something I can actually be proud to call

52
00:03:46,540 --> 00:03:48,300
myself a fan of.

53
00:03:48,300 --> 00:03:52,620
Oh boy, if only I knew how bad things really were.

54
00:03:52,620 --> 00:04:07,620
Over the next five years, I slowly came to grips with the absolute horror I was witnessing

55
00:04:07,620 --> 00:04:09,820
unfold in front of me.

56
00:04:09,820 --> 00:04:15,740
Not only were my greatest fears being realized, but it was worse than I ever could have imagined.

57
00:04:15,740 --> 00:04:20,620
Somehow, despite their unfathomable wealth and resources, Disney managed to fumble the

58
00:04:20,620 --> 00:04:25,180
bag on the most beloved IP in their entire company portfolio.

59
00:04:25,180 --> 00:04:28,360
At first, I didn't want to believe it was happening.

60
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:32,560
After film two of the trilogy, things were looking grim.

61
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:37,280
But Star Wars teaches us to cling onto hope in these very situations.

62
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:41,160
So I did, for as long as I possibly could.

63
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:46,920
Then one dreary December day in 2019, I walked into some godforsaken theater in Jacksonville

64
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:53,480
to witness the defining franchise of my childhood meet its bitter and unforgivable end.

65
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:56,680
Some people actually liked this movie.

66
00:04:56,680 --> 00:04:58,040
That's good for them.

67
00:04:58,040 --> 00:04:59,400
I didn't.

68
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:04,640
In fact, I can confidently say that no other film for as long as I live will possibly make

69
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:10,040
me feel the level of shame, betrayal, and hostility as I did in that moment.

70
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:14,320
I believe it was during the scene where the heroes are fighting the heavily armed space

71
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:19,080
fleet on horseback when I really started rethinking my life choices.

72
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:21,240
Star Wars, as I knew it, was dead.

73
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:26,840
It was something I had suspected all along, and by now, there was no more childhood naivete

74
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:28,560
to cushion the blow.

75
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:33,680
It dawned on me that all those years I had spent as a diehard fan had meant absolutely

76
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:34,680
nothing.

77
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:38,920
I felt like such a fool for convincing myself that there would be any sort of payoff for

78
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:42,400
the emotional investment I poured into this franchise.

79
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:46,920
I no longer cared about the story, the characters, anything.

80
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:52,000
All of a sudden, I wanted nothing to do with the series I loved for my entire life.

81
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,640
This movie made me hate Star Wars.

82
00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:58,840
It made me question why I even watched movies in the first place.

83
00:05:58,840 --> 00:06:05,320
After that dark day, my first love in cinema had been totally and unequivocally ruined.

84
00:06:05,320 --> 00:06:08,080
But luckily for me, there was another.

85
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:09,040
Uh, I don't think you should be investing in companies like-

86
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:11,040
Hey, you like the Spoke Post?

87
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:12,040
Yeah, of course.

88
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:15,320
They sent me this great camping chair, the parked box.

89
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:20,840
It's great for when you're camping out to be the first in line to one of the greatest

90
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:22,720
movie sensations of the year.

91
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:28,800
Of course, what good is camping out for the movie without some nice, delicious movie theater

92
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:29,800
popcorn?

93
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:36,280
Of course, I have a concealed in the middle of the Spoke Post Weekender Travel Bag.

94
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:40,960
Why go through the trouble of sneaking in popcorn if you don't also have your nice little

95
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:42,560
container of soda?

96
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:48,480
And with Bespoke's Cask Box, you too can have delicious popcorn refreshment and refreshing

97
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:52,440
soda to watch your favorite movie event of the year.

98
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:57,320
And these amazing products and more could be yours by visiting Bespoke Post's Web Zone

99

00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:05,120
Fill out the online quiz, and through the magic of the internet, they will ship a product

00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:07,400

And if you're a fan of coming attractions, Bespoke lets you preview your box.

103
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:15,880
And if you don't like what you see, you can swap it out or skip the month entirely at

104
00:08:15,880 --> 00:08:16,880
no charge.

105
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:21,280
I don't know, it seems kind of unethical to sneak your snacks into the theater.

106
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:26,320
I mean, if everyone started doing that, it might cause them to start going out of business.

107
00:08:27,320 --> 00:08:32,480
Well, you know, Rough G, after a while, the prices in there, they're just not a good

108
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:34,200
value anymore.

109
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:37,680
But where you will find a good value is with Bespoke Post.

110
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:42,760
Each box contains over $70 worth of stuff, and you get it for only a fraction of the

111
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:43,760
cost.

112
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:48,240
I'm not gonna lie, man, it doesn't look like anyone works here anymore.

113
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:50,800
Don't you think you should go back and start working on your videos?

114
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:54,960
Can you stop asking completely reasonable questions?

115
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:57,600
Don't ask questions, just consume product.

116
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:04,800
And you can consume the product at BespokePost.com slash EmpLemon20 for 20% off your first box.

117
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:08,720
Man, they sure do seem to be taking a while.

118
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:11,080
I wonder what's the holdup?

119
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:13,960
You think it has something to do with the quality of the movie industry?

120
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:14,960
I don't know what you mean by that.

121
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:17,640
There's been tons of great hits in the past few years.

122
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:20,640
Titanic, Jurassic Park, Die Hard.

123
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:23,200
Seems like the industry's doing better than it's ever been.

124
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:24,960
Emp, you're not making any sense.

125
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:25,960
What are you talking about?

126
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:28,400
Have you been living under a rock?

127
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:34,960
It's the biggest movie in history, the follow-up to the most beloved trilogy of all time.

128
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:35,960
Hello?

129
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:36,960
Hello?

130
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:39,320
I don't understand.

131
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:41,120
The premiere's just in a couple days.

132
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:42,120
Why is nobody here?

133
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:43,440
Why is nobody waiting?

134
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:45,940
Emp, you have to relax, all right?

135
00:09:45,940 --> 00:09:47,160
You're acting erratic.

136
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:49,280
Everything you're saying makes no sense.

137
00:09:49,280 --> 00:09:51,560
Titanic, Die Hard, Jurassic Park.

138
00:09:51,560 --> 00:09:55,640
Those movies haven't been popular for over 20 years.

139
00:09:55,640 --> 00:09:57,040
What did you just say?

140
00:09:57,040 --> 00:10:03,280
Yeah, those movies have not been popular for over 20 years.

141
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:06,480
You can't be serious.

142
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:17,360
Rusty, what year is it?

143
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:23,000
Star Wars Downward Spiral can be traced all the way back to the May of 1999 and the release

144
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:28,920
of The Phantom Menace, which many fans attribute as the kiss of death for the brand.

145
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:33,880
Just a few weeks prior, a different sci-fi franchise had sprung to life.

146
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:38,840
It is the world that has been pulled over your eyes to blind you from the truth.

147
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:42,520
The Matrix made itself known as the surprise of the year.

148
00:10:42,520 --> 00:10:46,920
It burst out of the gates, setting the box office record for an April release.

149
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:52,000
For a film that was only sparingly marketed, its meteoric success had seemingly come out

150
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,440
of nowhere.

151
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:57,300
Lead actor Keanu Reeves was mostly unknown at the time.

152
00:10:57,300 --> 00:11:01,880
Even less known were the film's enigmatic directors, the Wachowskis.

153
00:11:01,880 --> 00:11:06,020
Whoever they were, they'd captured lightning in a bottle.

154
00:11:06,020 --> 00:11:09,720
Audiences were being drawn in by nothing more than pure intrigue.

155
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:13,300
The Matrix packed the theaters for one simple reason.

156
00:11:13,300 --> 00:11:15,900
No one had ever seen anything like it.

157
00:11:15,900 --> 00:11:18,900
It was ambitious, innovative, and salient.

158
00:11:18,900 --> 00:11:23,340
It pioneered such revolutionary techniques in filmmaking that its influence is still

159
00:11:23,340 --> 00:11:24,980
felt today.

160
00:11:24,980 --> 00:11:30,220
But what truly set The Matrix apart from the competition was its philosophical depth.

161
00:11:30,220 --> 00:11:36,260
For many, it represented the ultimate exploration of one of modern man's deepest fears.

162
00:11:36,260 --> 00:11:40,340
The year 1999 seems to come up a lot in my videos.

163
00:11:40,340 --> 00:11:45,100
I have come to view it as this inflection point in the trajectory of modern society,

164
00:11:45,100 --> 00:11:49,780
after which everything seems to have taken an ominous turn for the worse.

165
00:11:49,780 --> 00:11:52,720
Turns out the future ain't quite what it's cracked up to be.

166
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:57,640
And while dystopian visions of tomorrow were nothing new, the one presented by The Matrix

167
00:11:57,640 --> 00:12:00,520
is exceptionally bleak.

168
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:03,900
Human beings have forever been defined by technology.

169
00:12:03,900 --> 00:12:08,940
Our ability to transform natural elements into complex tools is what separates us from

170
00:12:08,940 --> 00:12:11,160
the rest of the animal kingdom.

171
00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:16,440
But somewhere along the way, tools became a little too complex, and we started calling

172
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:19,520
them something else—machines.

173
00:12:19,520 --> 00:12:24,280
While it's difficult to pinpoint exactly when this shift occurred, it seemed to coincide

174
00:12:24,280 --> 00:12:28,540
with a time when technology started to feel intimidating.

175
00:12:28,540 --> 00:12:33,560
This sentiment became apparent at the start of the Industrial Revolution, when machines

176
00:12:33,560 --> 00:12:35,800
began replacing us.

177
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:40,800
Perhaps the first conflict between man and machine can be traced back to an 18th century

178
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:46,680
weaver named Ned Ludd, who, according to legend, smashed a pair of knitting racks in a fit

179
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:47,680
of rage.

180
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:54,000
By the 19th century, technology had begun to transform the entire textile industry.

181
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:58,600
Skilled artisans were now being undercut by automated factories which could output similar

182
00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:01,200
goods at a much lower expense.

183
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:07,080
In 1811, the disenfranchised started lashing out against their mechanical oppressors.

184
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:14,000
Taking after the story of Ned Ludd, this anti-technology faction would soon become known as the Luddites.

185
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:19,480
The movement wouldn't last long, as the military soon cracked down on the insubordination.

186
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:24,360
In time, the cultural consensus would go on to look back on the Luddites derisively,

187
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:29,200
viewing them as an irrational hindrance to the natural pursuit of progress.

188
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:32,840
After all, automation ends up benefiting everyone else.

189
00:13:32,840 --> 00:13:37,640
If someone ends up losing their job because of it, they're just taking one for the team.

190
00:13:37,640 --> 00:13:42,200
It was easy for all sorts of people to think this way, until all of a sudden, they were

191
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:44,960
the ones getting replaced.

192
00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:50,820
As technology continued to rapidly advance, concerns over automation began to appear in

193
00:13:50,820 --> 00:13:52,120
fiction.

194
00:13:52,120 --> 00:13:56,920
The American folktale of John Henry was notably one of the first of its kind to feature a

195
00:13:56,920 --> 00:13:59,320
machine as an antagonist.

196
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:04,440
The legend tells the story of a railroad worker who drops dead after racing a steam-powered

197
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:05,740
drill.

198
00:14:05,740 --> 00:14:10,200
Later depictions of a machine-powered future would only get more grim.

199
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:16,560
The 1927 film Metropolis presented the first depiction of a post-industrial dystopia.

200
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:21,600
It laid the groundwork for what would eventually become known as the cyberpunk genre, a new

201
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:27,400
wave in science fiction which expressed hesitancy to the rapid expansion of technology.

202
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:33,640
It envisioned a future in which the pervasiveness of machines would oppress and suffocate mankind.

203
00:14:33,640 --> 00:14:39,360
While concerns of technology primarily focused on its omnipresence, others foresaw an additional

204
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:41,660
threat in its intelligence.

205
00:14:41,660 --> 00:14:46,720
In the midst of its bionic world, Metropolis featured one of the first concepts of a bionic

206
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:50,400
man, which we now refer to as robots.

207
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:54,720
They represented an acknowledgement that somewhere ahead on the horizon, machines could

208
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:59,280
eventually match and even surpass the capacities of human beings.

209
00:14:59,280 --> 00:15:03,840
In the 20th century, much of the pioneering literature about robots would be explored

210
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:06,600
by sci-fi author Isaac Asimov.

211
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:11,480
He is perhaps best known for coining the three laws of robotics, which sought to address

212
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:16,760
the most immediate threat that life-sized automatons may evoke, the prospect of them

213
00:15:16,760 --> 00:15:18,640
turning on their masters.

214
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:23,800
Asimov's work was compelling, especially during a time period which gave rise to the

215
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:26,160
very first computers.

216
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:31,560
All of a sudden, the idea of intelligent machines was spilling into reality, although at this

217
00:15:31,560 --> 00:15:35,120
point, it hardly resembled anything human.

218
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:41,040
The original computers were almost Lovecraftian, an incomprehensible wall of electronic components

219
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:46,860
that, by some terrifying miracle, were capable of mimicking the foundational elements of

220
00:15:46,860 --> 00:15:47,860
thought.

221
00:15:48,100 --> 00:15:53,780
Contrary to their initial humanoid depictions, computers were practically formless.

222
00:15:53,780 --> 00:15:58,180
They could theoretically take on the appearance of anything we could imagine.

223
00:15:58,180 --> 00:16:03,140
The film 2001 A Space Odyssey would introduce the first landmark appearance of artificial

224
00:16:03,140 --> 00:16:05,220
intelligence in cinema.

225
00:16:05,220 --> 00:16:11,340
The cold and calculating HAL 9000 would unnerve audiences for decades to come.

226
00:16:11,340 --> 00:16:16,340
Director Stanley Kubrick reimagined the machine antagonist as more than a single threatening

227
00:16:16,340 --> 00:16:17,340
entity.

228
00:16:17,340 --> 00:16:21,900
Rather, one which served as a hostile extension of the setting itself.

229
00:16:21,900 --> 00:16:25,340
This idea would be expanded on further by the artist H.R.

230
00:16:25,340 --> 00:16:31,140
Geiger, who produced nightmarish illustrations of living things being smothered by an all-encompassing

231
00:16:31,140 --> 00:16:33,440
mechanical environment.

232
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:38,740
In 1973, he would create one of his most notable works while collaborating with the progressive

233
00:16:38,740 --> 00:16:41,260
rock band Emerson Lake & Palmer.

234
00:16:41,260 --> 00:16:46,700
The group was finishing their new album Brain Salad Surgery, which depicts an epic war between

235
00:16:46,700 --> 00:16:48,800
humans and computers.

236
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:54,180
While listening through, Geiger composed what would eventually become the album's artwork.

237
00:16:54,180 --> 00:17:01,060
An outer cover featuring a sterile metal sarcophagus, which opens to reveal a lobotomized woman.

238
00:17:01,060 --> 00:17:06,100
While Geiger envisioned a physical convergence between man and machine, sci-fi author Philip

239
00:17:06,100 --> 00:17:09,020
K. Dick took a more conceptual approach.

240
00:17:09,020 --> 00:17:14,460
His 1968 novel Due Android's Dream of Electric Sheep features human-like replicants who are

241
00:17:14,460 --> 00:17:18,220
practically indistinguishable from biological men.

242
00:17:18,220 --> 00:17:23,400
This premise would later be adapted into the 1982 film Blade Runner, where the corruptive

243
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:29,280
influence of technology has expanded to threaten our perception of reality itself.

244
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:34,620
By this time, computers were being welcomed into people's homes, and the advent of a virtual

245
00:17:34,620 --> 00:17:38,740
reality was no longer a question of if, but when.

246
00:17:38,740 --> 00:17:43,760
The rapid acceleration of computing power began to fuel theories of a potential technological

247
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:49,880
singularity on the horizon, in which super-intelligent machines could achieve god-like abilities,

248
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:52,960
thus rendering all of mankind obsolete.

249
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:57,840
At the same time, fictional works began to push the concept of machine warfare to its

250
00:17:57,840 --> 00:17:59,620
absolute limit.

251
00:17:59,620 --> 00:18:05,780
If a confrontation between humans and machines did arise, just how bad could things get?

252
00:18:05,780 --> 00:18:10,480
The Terminator franchise envisioned the human race being driven to the brink of extinction

253
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:16,620
by nuclear hellfire, a somber outcome indeed, but one which many would find preferable to

254
00:18:16,620 --> 00:18:19,800
the scenario depicted by The Matrix.

255
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:25,180
In a world where mankind has long since lost its war against the machines, human beings

256
00:18:25,180 --> 00:18:31,480
have been forced into a fate worse than death, a state of total submission in which our homeostatic

257
00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:35,280
energy is harvested to power the machine world.

258
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:41,100
The collective human consciousness is imprisoned and pacified by a lifelike simulation.

259
00:18:41,100 --> 00:18:46,200
This premise is very much reminiscent of Plato's allegory of the cave, an age-old metaphor

260
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:49,280
about the nature of truth and objectivity.

261
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:54,080
It seeks to highlight philosophical enlightenment as the pathway to salvation.

262
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:58,600
But of course, that's to assume that whatever's waiting for us outside the cave is actually

263
00:18:58,600 --> 00:19:00,120
worth the journey.

264
00:19:00,120 --> 00:19:04,820
Coincidentally, one year before the debut of The Matrix, an entirely different film

265
00:19:04,860 --> 00:19:09,260
had already explored the premise of escaping from a false reality.

266
00:19:09,260 --> 00:19:13,860
And while we never see what happens to Truman after he breaks free of the simulation, it's

267
00:19:13,860 --> 00:19:17,020
implied that he's gone to a better place.

268
00:19:17,020 --> 00:19:20,600
In The Matrix, however, the decision is not as clear.

269
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:25,440
It's human nature to seek out truth, but does there come a point when the truth is so ugly

270
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:28,160
that we'd be better off not knowing at all?

271
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:33,480
How many of us would choose to remain in the cave if we knew the horrors that lay beyond it?

272
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:37,840
Perhaps it would be better for us to simply stay put and play it safe.

273
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:41,000
But the story of humanity would indicate otherwise.

274
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:46,540
It goes against human nature to remain imprisoned in both a cave and a simulation, for the simple

275
00:19:46,540 --> 00:19:49,340
reason that it undermines our autonomy.

276
00:19:49,340 --> 00:19:54,920
For just as technology defines mankind, so too does self-determination.

277
00:19:54,920 --> 00:19:59,720
The idea that we are the masters of our own destiny, that our decisions are the product

278
00:19:59,720 --> 00:20:03,840
of free will, and not some pre-programmed directive.

279
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:07,940
In this way, we are distinct from both animals and machines.

280
00:20:07,940 --> 00:20:13,340
Human beings aren't required to behave in ways that are entirely instinctual nor logical.

281
00:20:13,340 --> 00:20:18,460
While computers may one day reach a level of intellect magnitudes higher than our own,

282
00:20:18,460 --> 00:20:22,960
it's unclear whether they will ever be able to truly think like us.

283
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:28,520
Choice is unmistakably human, even if those choices often aren't the most rational.

284
00:20:28,520 --> 00:20:32,560
It's for this reason why Neo is such an engaging protagonist.

285
00:20:32,560 --> 00:20:37,440
His journey relies on regaining the right to choose, no matter the monumentality of

286
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:39,640
the system standing in his way.

287
00:20:39,640 --> 00:20:44,980
Audiences couldn't help but relate to Neo's story, especially during a time when so many

288
00:20:44,980 --> 00:20:48,280
of us were losing our autonomy.

289
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:53,120
The 20th century was marked by the rise and fall of totalitarian regimes.

290
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:57,380
The collapse of the Soviet Union was supposed to signal the dawning of a new era in which

291
00:20:57,380 --> 00:21:01,900
the people of the world could finally exist as liberated citizens.

292
00:21:01,900 --> 00:21:07,460
The 90s were generally regarded as a time of idealistic optimism for the future, a sentiment

293
00:21:07,460 --> 00:21:12,820
which was nonetheless undercut by the ominous feeling that something was not quite right,

294
00:21:12,820 --> 00:21:18,220
that the so-called free society we were inhabiting didn't exactly come as advertised.

295
00:21:18,220 --> 00:21:22,840
There's a scene in The Matrix where Agent Smith explains why the machines chose to simulate

296
00:21:22,840 --> 00:21:24,980
the year 1999.

297
00:21:24,980 --> 00:21:28,260
He describes it as the peak of civilization.

298
00:21:28,260 --> 00:21:32,900
Obviously the setting was intended to match the contemporary release of the film, but

299
00:21:32,900 --> 00:21:38,300
it's eerie to look back on that line today and realize just how true it still rings.

300
00:21:38,300 --> 00:21:44,140
While the machines canonically intended to pass off the year 1999 as a convincing reality,

301
00:21:44,140 --> 00:21:48,500
it ironically marked a point when everything started to feel artificial.

302
00:21:48,500 --> 00:21:54,600
The late 20th century saw the rise of a different kind of machine, the corporate machine, financial

303
00:21:54,600 --> 00:21:59,720
behemoths whose influence grew to rival the most dominant empires in history.

304
00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:05,080
These man-made entities have very much become the monolithic overlords of the present day,

305
00:22:05,080 --> 00:22:08,520
and they've been actively twisting the reality around us.

306
00:22:08,520 --> 00:22:14,240
It was hard to notice at first, everything seemed so normal, but eventually the anomalies

307
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:17,160
just became too much to ignore.

308
00:22:17,160 --> 00:22:22,160
Despite all the concerns of machines acting like us, no one could anticipate just how

309
00:22:22,160 --> 00:22:25,480
much we would start acting like machines.

310
00:22:25,480 --> 00:22:30,040
It's strange to consider how one of the original worries about automation had to do with it

311
00:22:30,040 --> 00:22:32,560
providing us too much leisure.

312
00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:36,360
If that was ever the case, we surely haven't seen any of it.

313
00:22:36,360 --> 00:22:40,400
In fact, there's an argument to be made that the average person today is doing more

314
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:43,600
work than at any other time in recent history.

315
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:49,480
Simultaneously, the nature of that work has only become more robotic and dehumanizing.

316
00:22:49,480 --> 00:22:54,760
The ruthless efficiency of the labor market has rendered individuality almost worthless.

317
00:22:54,760 --> 00:22:58,280
You either fit in to the preordained system or you don't.

318
00:22:58,280 --> 00:23:00,880
Either way, you're just another cog.

319
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:05,040
The fruits of your labor serve no greater philosophical purpose.

320
00:23:05,040 --> 00:23:09,800
You can't help but get a little existential when it feels like everything you do is meaningless.

321
00:23:09,800 --> 00:23:14,480
It's a feeling that now extends far beyond the office cubicle.

322
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:19,600
The relentless thirst for profit has expanded to pervade nearly all walks of life.

323
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:24,480
Much like the fate of humans in the Matrix, modern consumers are created and harvested

324
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:28,880
to feed some inescapable system that we will never comprehend.

325
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:33,000
And although we've found ourselves with no shortage of things to buy, it's somewhat

326
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:37,860
shocking just how limited our options have become pretty much everywhere else.

327
00:23:37,860 --> 00:23:42,400
If you've ever wanted to experience how it feels to be in the Matrix, look no further

328
00:23:42,400 --> 00:24:11,880
than the very industry from which it came.

329
00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:15,960
It seems like these days, everything has to be a franchise.

330
00:24:15,960 --> 00:24:20,900
Because while a standalone film is limited to its moment in the sun, a cinematic universe

331
00:24:20,900 --> 00:24:23,900
can be milked until the sun stops shining.

332
00:24:23,900 --> 00:24:29,220
Why allow something to die when you can keep it in a perpetual state of suspended animation,

333
00:24:29,220 --> 00:24:33,720
siphoning off every last drop of whatever made it so alive in the first place?

334
00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:38,300
The Matrix, of course, had its share of sequels, which never quite reached the acclaim of the

335
00:24:38,300 --> 00:24:39,300
original.

336
00:24:39,460 --> 00:24:44,180
While they have been criticized for being a tad too cryptic and incoherent at times,

337
00:24:44,180 --> 00:24:48,200
there was never any doubt over whether they deserved to be made at all.

338
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:52,720
Each of them represented a clear artistic vision and continued the story in a meaningful

339
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:53,720
way.

340
00:24:53,720 --> 00:24:58,120
They served a purpose beyond being a shameless cash grab.

341
00:24:58,120 --> 00:25:04,600
2019 marked 20 years since the release of The Matrix, and much had changed since then.

342
00:25:04,600 --> 00:25:08,880
Keanu Reeves moved on to an entirely new action franchise.

343
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:14,300
The Wachowski brothers were now the Wachowski sisters, and the film industry had mutated

344
00:25:14,300 --> 00:25:17,380
into an almost unrecognizable wasteland.

345
00:25:17,380 --> 00:25:22,940
Gone were the days of the ambitious auteurs who defined Hollywood's greatest hits.

346
00:25:22,940 --> 00:25:27,420
Modern blockbusters now view ambition as an unnecessary risk.

347
00:25:27,420 --> 00:25:32,700
Turns out that film studios had become 20 years smarter at making movies profitable.

348
00:25:32,700 --> 00:25:37,040
The first Matrix film wound up making Warner Bros nearly half a billion dollars at the

349
00:25:37,040 --> 00:25:41,600
box office, which was almost eight times their initial investment.

350
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:45,900
This remarkable financial success makes it all the more baffling to consider that had

351
00:25:45,900 --> 00:25:49,700
it been pitched today, The Matrix would have probably never been made.

352
00:25:49,700 --> 00:25:54,740
I mean, if you really think about it, when was the last time any major Hollywood studio

353
00:25:54,740 --> 00:25:57,580
rolled the dice on an unproven concept?

354
00:25:57,580 --> 00:26:03,060
Could an R-rated blockbuster with such esoteric themes even exist nowadays?

355
00:26:03,080 --> 00:26:08,340
This used to be some place you'd go to witness something truly spectacular, but lately, every

356
00:26:08,340 --> 00:26:12,880
aspect of the industry has been on a steady march towards mediocrity.

357
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:18,540
Twitter user Eric Krebs helped visualize the stark decline of originality in Hollywood.

358
00:26:18,540 --> 00:26:23,840
It's now common for the top ten grossing films of the year to be entirely composed of recycled

359
00:26:23,840 --> 00:26:26,860
concepts from pre-existing source material.

360
00:26:26,860 --> 00:26:32,000
The superhero genre alone, which The Matrix ironically helped inspire, has ballooned to

361
00:26:32,020 --> 00:26:35,460
fill up nearly half of all Blockbuster's release.

362
00:26:35,460 --> 00:26:41,500
The number of R-rated films has been gutted to make way for the far more marketable PG-13,

363
00:26:41,500 --> 00:26:47,160
a format which neuters the filmmaker's ability to explore sophisticated ideas.

364
00:26:47,160 --> 00:26:52,580
The once promising field of computer graphics now comes off far more as a crutch for overworked

365
00:26:52,580 --> 00:26:56,780
productions who can't be bothered to compose an actual scene.

366
00:26:56,780 --> 00:27:02,280
The Hollywood simulation is now almost entirely dependent on machines, and the results are

367
00:27:02,280 --> 00:27:05,480
just as uninspiring as you may have guessed.

368
00:27:05,480 --> 00:27:10,220
It seems like every big-budget film today, no matter who directed it or which studio

369
00:27:10,220 --> 00:27:15,920
backed it, now looks like the same bland and homogenous visual sludge.

370
00:27:15,920 --> 00:27:20,520
There is a disturbing lack of humanity in modern-day blockbusters.

371
00:27:20,520 --> 00:27:25,200
Creative control has been wrestled away from filmmakers and placed in the hands of bureaucratic

372
00:27:25,260 --> 00:27:31,260
committees who audit every decision in the production process over its financial sensibility.

373
00:27:31,260 --> 00:27:36,080
Anything remotely nuanced or edgy is generally not advisable.

374
00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:40,940
Movies are now expected to be international events and should in no way touch on any issues

375
00:27:40,940 --> 00:27:45,100
that may marginally offend anyone on the opposite side of the globe.

376
00:27:45,100 --> 00:27:50,260
For an industry once renowned for its limitless possibilities, it's disheartening to see

377
00:27:50,260 --> 00:27:54,420
so much of cinema now defined by what you can't do.

378
00:27:54,420 --> 00:27:58,720
The craft of filmmaking has been streamlined from an art to a science.

379
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:03,540
Major releases no longer feel like an organic exercise in creativity.

380
00:28:03,540 --> 00:28:07,380
They feel like the product of a heavily controlled formula.

381
00:28:07,380 --> 00:28:12,440
Much like a rollercoaster, they're designed to offer the impression of a dire situation,

382
00:28:12,440 --> 00:28:15,840
while all along you were never in any real danger.

383
00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:20,260
After it's all said and done, you always wind up right back where you started.

384
00:28:20,260 --> 00:28:22,480
You haven't really gone anywhere.

385
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:24,760
Why allow the heroes to fail?

386
00:28:24,760 --> 00:28:28,020
Why allow a fan favorite character to truly die?

387
00:28:28,020 --> 00:28:31,420
Why allow the guy to not get the girl in the end?

388
00:28:31,420 --> 00:28:36,260
Sure, doing so might produce a moment that's actually meaningful, but that would imply

389
00:28:36,260 --> 00:28:40,760
that movies can tell a story that's even remotely complex.

390
00:28:40,760 --> 00:28:46,560
It's as if Hollywood is no longer capable of producing stories which are actually satisfying.

391
00:28:46,560 --> 00:28:51,340
They instead come off as a disparate patchwork of amusement with very little substance or

392
00:28:51,340 --> 00:28:54,240
cohesion holding anything together.

393
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:58,160
It's like going to a restaurant expecting a gourmet meal and getting served a plate

394
00:28:58,160 --> 00:28:59,160
of candy.

395
00:28:59,160 --> 00:29:04,200
Sure, it sets off all the right receptors, but rather than making you feel full, it just

396
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:05,780
makes you sick.

397
00:29:05,780 --> 00:29:11,000
And the sickening sweetness of movies today is delivered through meaningless nostalgia,

398
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:17,440
assaulting the audience with a nauseating barrage of familiar faces, places, and sounds.

399
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:22,200
Movies now go so far as to resurrect the dead just to keep the same old song and dance

400
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:27,360
going, as part of some desperate ploy to remind us of a time when movies actually made us

401
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:29,140
feel something.

402
00:29:29,140 --> 00:29:31,360
Some of us aren't fooled, however.

403
00:29:31,360 --> 00:29:37,440
We know that we're not living in 1999 anymore and recognize the product on screen as a hollow

404
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:41,880
imitation, only resembling the original superficially.

405
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:48,120
Just like a machine, it has no soul, and it replaced whatever was alive long ago.

406
00:29:48,120 --> 00:29:50,680
Such is the fate of the modern franchise.

407
00:29:50,680 --> 00:29:57,420
It happened to Star Wars, and soon enough, it would happen with The Matrix 2.

408
00:29:57,420 --> 00:30:02,580
These days it seems like no entertainment property is safe from the dreaded reboot.

409
00:30:02,580 --> 00:30:07,600
As the pool of original ideas has dried up, Hollywood has determined that it's now far

410
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:12,980
more cost-effective to simply regurgitate existing brands from a bygone era.

411
00:30:12,980 --> 00:30:18,000
While the uninitiated may feel excited to reunite with that special friend, it's important

412
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:22,120
to realize what exactly made it so special in the first place.

413
00:30:22,120 --> 00:30:27,420
Surely it wasn't geriatric celebrities trying and failing to relive the glory days, nor

414
00:30:27,420 --> 00:30:32,980
was it a bubble-wrapped and sanitized retelling of a story we've already heard before.

415
00:30:32,980 --> 00:30:39,160
How about the nonsensical addition of a marketable character whose only purpose is to drive toy sales?

416
00:30:39,160 --> 00:30:43,860
If you ask me, the vast majority of rebooted franchises would have been far better off

417
00:30:43,860 --> 00:30:45,460
staying dead.

418
00:30:45,460 --> 00:30:48,700
They aren't interested in selling a quality product.

419
00:30:48,700 --> 00:30:50,700
All they're selling is a legacy.

420
00:30:50,700 --> 00:30:56,900
A legacy which stands to be actively tarnished by whatever vapid slop is being pumped out today.

421
00:30:56,900 --> 00:30:58,300
But what can I say?

422
00:30:58,300 --> 00:31:03,020
There's a reason why shameless pandering sequels continue to flood the market.

423
00:31:03,020 --> 00:31:05,020
People keep paying to see them.

424
00:31:05,020 --> 00:31:09,660
It's almost as if modern consumers have been conditioned to accept nothing more.

425
00:31:09,660 --> 00:31:12,820
To be content with middling disappointment.

426
00:31:12,820 --> 00:31:19,500
Reboots have become inevitable, and studios are now hungry to defile the graves of long-dead franchises.

427
00:31:19,500 --> 00:31:24,880
Naturally, it was only a matter of time before The Matrix was next on the chopping block.

428
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:30,420
It was the end of 2019, right around the time Star Wars got sent to the glue factory,

429
00:31:30,420 --> 00:31:33,600
when news came out that The Matrix was next.

430
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:37,680
Warner Bros. wanted a fourth installment to the series, and they were gonna make it with

431
00:31:37,680 --> 00:31:39,920
or without the Wachowskis.

432
00:31:39,920 --> 00:31:46,520
The thing is, there already was a fourth Matrix film, the excellent and often overlooked Animatrix,

433
00:31:46,520 --> 00:31:50,560
an anthology of short stories set in the Matrix universe.

434
00:31:50,560 --> 00:31:54,200
It was a supplemental release that truly deserved to be made.

435
00:31:54,200 --> 00:31:58,840
One curated by the Wachowskis to celebrate the spirit of the originals by opening it

436
00:31:58,840 --> 00:32:01,600
up to the interpretations of others.

437
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:06,440
The stories within were imaginative, dynamic, and stylistically vibrant.

438
00:32:06,440 --> 00:32:12,180
A fitting send-off to a project which placed so much emphasis on free expression.

439
00:32:12,180 --> 00:32:14,720
If only it was that simple.

440
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:19,800
Warner Bros. could sense that The Matrix brand still had quite a bit of money left in it.

441
00:32:19,800 --> 00:32:21,660
Everything else was getting rebooted.

442
00:32:21,660 --> 00:32:23,240
Why not The Matrix?

443
00:32:23,240 --> 00:32:27,360
It didn't matter that the story had already reached its logical conclusion.

444
00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:31,640
They had tickets to sell, as well as a sleek new streaming service.

445
00:32:31,640 --> 00:32:35,120
The studio basically gave the Wachowskis an ultimatum.

446
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:40,020
They could either oversee the spiritual death of their brainchild, or hand the job over

447
00:32:40,020 --> 00:32:41,760
to someone else.

448
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:46,600
Either way, the defining achievement of their lives would be turned into an abject mockery

449
00:32:46,600 --> 00:32:48,780
of everything it once stood for.

450
00:32:48,780 --> 00:32:52,920
Upon hearing the news, Lily Wachowski wanted nothing to do with it.

451
00:32:52,920 --> 00:32:59,600
So that just left Lana to figure out how to defeat The Matrix once and for all.

452
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:03,660
So what do you do if you're being forced into a movie you don't want to make?

453
00:33:03,660 --> 00:33:08,500
Well, believe it or not, the wisdom of how to handle the fate of one of Hollywood's

454
00:33:08,500 --> 00:33:12,740
most acclaimed enterprises could be found in one of its least.

455
00:33:12,740 --> 00:33:18,460
And it was all made possible by, coincidentally, an unlikely hero named Tom.

456
00:33:18,460 --> 00:33:25,220
1999 would mark the big break for comedian Tom Green, who landed a new show on MTV.

457
00:33:25,220 --> 00:33:30,340
He soon established himself as a pioneer of shock humor and the socially uncomfortable,

458
00:33:30,340 --> 00:33:34,660
serving as the progenitor for some of the most popular comedy today.

459
00:33:34,660 --> 00:33:38,660
Tom was very much ahead of the curve, in more ways than one.

460
00:33:38,660 --> 00:33:43,740
Because in 2001, he would produce something so avant-garde that we have only just begun

461
00:33:43,740 --> 00:33:45,420
to appreciate it.

462
00:33:45,420 --> 00:33:48,660
What is the most disgusting film of 2001?

463
00:33:48,660 --> 00:33:53,340
The champion is Freddy Got Fingered with Tom Green making David Spade look like Jim Carrey

464
00:33:53,340 --> 00:33:56,220
and Jim Carrey look like Laurence Olivier.

465
00:33:56,220 --> 00:34:01,260
Accounts differ depending on who you ask, but legend has it, Tom was required to make

466
00:34:01,260 --> 00:34:05,740
a movie against his will due to some contractual dispute with the studio.

467
00:34:05,740 --> 00:34:11,340
20th Century Fox would end up getting their movie, but the comedian would have the last laugh.

468
00:34:11,340 --> 00:34:16,780
The result was Freddy Got Fingered, a film so diabolically awful that it all feels like

469
00:34:16,780 --> 00:34:18,740
one big practical joke.

470
00:34:18,740 --> 00:34:23,740
Perhaps no other movie out there expresses such contempt for the Hollywood system.

471
00:34:23,740 --> 00:34:27,660
It literally tells the story of an artist wasting the studio's money.

472
00:34:27,660 --> 00:34:29,500
There's a million dollars gone.

473
00:34:29,500 --> 00:34:31,420
Easy come, easy go.

474
00:34:31,420 --> 00:34:39,140
And while he's not exactly Neo, he is portrayed as a self-aware person trapped inside a contrived reality.

475
00:34:39,140 --> 00:34:43,740
At the time of its release, nobody really understood what the film was about.

476
00:34:43,740 --> 00:34:48,100
It went on to become one of the most critically panned movies of this century.

477
00:34:48,100 --> 00:34:53,220
Tom Green proudly accepted his five Razzie awards, reportedly having to be dragged off

478
00:34:53,220 --> 00:34:58,620
stage after breaking out a never-ending harmonica solo during its acceptance speech.

479
00:34:58,620 --> 00:35:00,780
It just didn't make any sense.

480
00:35:00,780 --> 00:35:03,220
Everyone dreams of being a movie star.

481
00:35:03,220 --> 00:35:07,100
To be given such an opportunity should be considered a great honor.

482
00:35:07,140 --> 00:35:12,900
Why would someone just throw it all away like that and turn the whole thing into a laughingstock?

483
00:35:12,900 --> 00:35:16,780
How could anyone willingly attach their name to something so embarrassing?

484
00:35:16,780 --> 00:35:21,140
Well, you have to remember that Tom Green was ahead of the curve.

485
00:35:21,140 --> 00:35:26,180
Maybe he knew what the film industry would become and saw the way out.

486
00:35:26,180 --> 00:35:30,940
Turns out the best way to defeat the Hollywood machine was giving the studio the finger.

487
00:35:30,940 --> 00:35:33,180
Hi, this is my painting that I made.

488
00:35:33,180 --> 00:35:34,820
It's called Tiger Zebra.

489
00:35:34,860 --> 00:35:37,940
I worked really, really hard on it, and now I'm going to go put it up in the National

490
00:35:37,940 --> 00:35:41,540
Art Gallery, because that's where all the really, really good paintings go, and I want

491
00:35:41,540 --> 00:35:45,740
mine to be seen by all the people that appreciate really, really good art like this.

492
00:35:49,580 --> 00:35:54,980
In December of 2021, I returned to another Jacksonville theater fully preparing to be

493
00:35:54,980 --> 00:35:57,900
debilitated by another hideous sequel.

494
00:35:57,900 --> 00:36:02,440
But what I ended up witnessing instead was unlike anything I could have expected.

495
00:36:02,440 --> 00:36:08,300
In many ways, what I saw that day was very much a terrible end to a beloved franchise.

496
00:36:08,300 --> 00:36:13,740
From a nonsensical and immersion-shattering plot to goofy, dumbed-down characters.

497
00:36:13,740 --> 00:36:19,840
A film stuffed to the brim with baffling moments like Neo watching the first Matrix on a projector,

498
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:23,640
pouring a container of blue pills into his mouth, and a strawberry.

499
00:36:23,640 --> 00:36:25,660
A strawberry?

500
00:36:25,660 --> 00:36:30,960
At first glance, it looked to be yet another Rise of Skywalker, but something felt different

501
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:31,960
this time around.

502
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:36,760
Nothing comforts anxiety like a little nostalgia.

503
00:36:36,760 --> 00:36:42,760
The Matrix Resurrections was a film so aggressively idiotic that it seemed almost deliberate.

504
00:36:42,760 --> 00:36:47,260
As if the creators were attempting to weaponize their own stupidity.

505
00:36:47,260 --> 00:36:48,560
And then it hit me.

506
00:36:48,560 --> 00:36:51,120
This wasn't just a sequel to The Matrix.

507
00:36:51,120 --> 00:36:54,000
It was a sequel to Freddy Got Fingered.

508
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:57,120
It was a movie about not wanting to make a movie.

509
00:36:57,120 --> 00:37:01,920
I'm sure you can understand why our beloved parent company, Warner Brothers, has decided

510
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:04,280
to make a sequel to the trilogy.

511
00:37:04,280 --> 00:37:10,160
Only this time, instead of wasting a paltry 14 million of studio funding, The Matrix Resurrections

512
00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:13,560
managed to squander more than 10 times that.

513
00:37:13,560 --> 00:37:18,840
If the creators did choose to sabotage the film in that way, then it may very well be

514
00:37:18,840 --> 00:37:22,040
one of the most expensive jokes ever told.

515
00:37:22,040 --> 00:37:26,340
A Matrix reboot was always going to be an artistic failure.

516
00:37:26,340 --> 00:37:29,980
And as well make that failure an inside job.

517
00:37:33,860 --> 00:37:36,720
But perhaps you think I'm giving them too much credit.

518
00:37:36,720 --> 00:37:40,460
That it's just another mediocre piece of crap like all the rest.

519
00:37:40,460 --> 00:37:44,740
Maybe Lana Wachowski, like many directors, ran out of talent.

520
00:37:44,740 --> 00:37:48,340
And The Matrix Resurrections was a genuine attempt.

521
00:37:48,340 --> 00:37:52,460
As far as any of us are concerned, that's the official explanation.

522
00:37:52,460 --> 00:37:53,460
But I don't know.

523
00:37:53,460 --> 00:37:58,820
I'd like to believe that for once, a shameless Hollywood reboot actually meant something.

524
00:37:58,820 --> 00:38:02,660
That it was more than just another big fat waste of time.

525
00:38:02,660 --> 00:38:07,700
Make no mistake about it, what I saw that day was an undeniable train wreck.

526
00:38:07,700 --> 00:38:10,220
But it was somehow beautiful.

527
00:38:10,220 --> 00:38:13,460
Not for what it was, but for what it represented.

528
00:38:13,460 --> 00:38:18,140
Sitting there in the theater on that December afternoon, I felt oddly vindicated.

529
00:38:18,140 --> 00:38:23,060
Like all the grief I suffered from The Rise of Skywalker had suddenly lifted.

530
00:38:23,060 --> 00:38:27,740
At the end of the day, both Star Wars and The Matrix tell a similar story.

531
00:38:27,740 --> 00:38:32,760
They offer us tales of a great hero rebelling against oppressive machinery.

532
00:38:32,760 --> 00:38:38,140
And while Star Wars was eventually tempted to the dark side, The Matrix remained defiant

533
00:38:38,140 --> 00:38:40,120
until the very end.

534
00:38:40,120 --> 00:38:44,660
It may have met a bitter fate, but it was one which nonetheless remained under control

535
00:38:44,660 --> 00:38:46,160
of the artist.

536
00:38:46,160 --> 00:38:50,540
In this regard, it was honorable, even in defeat.

537
00:38:50,540 --> 00:38:55,000
When faced with the death of their legacy, the creators still had enough dignity to go

538
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:56,920
down with the ship.

539
00:38:56,920 --> 00:38:59,340
They informed me they're gonna do it with or without us.

540
00:38:59,340 --> 00:39:02,080
And they made it clear they'll kill our contract if we don't cooperate.

541
00:39:02,080 --> 00:39:07,680
I know you said the story was over for you, but that's the thing about stories.

542
00:39:07,680 --> 00:39:09,480
They never really end, do they?

543
00:39:09,480 --> 00:39:14,160
We're still telling the same stories we've always told, just with different names, different

544
00:39:14,160 --> 00:39:16,260
faces.

545
00:39:16,260 --> 00:39:19,320
The sheeple aren't going anywhere.

546
00:39:19,320 --> 00:39:20,320
They like my world.

547
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:22,740
They don't want freedom or empowerment.

548
00:39:22,740 --> 00:39:24,840
They want to be controlled.

549
00:39:24,840 --> 00:39:26,960
They crave the comfort of certainty.

550
00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:37,880
And that means you two back in your pods, unconscious and alone, just like them.

551
00:39:37,880 --> 00:39:42,480
The Matrix resurrections will go down in history as a commercial failure.

552
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:48,760
With losses in excess of $30 million, it will forever be known as a box office bomb.

553
00:39:48,760 --> 00:39:53,840
After just a few weeks, the whole thing was almost completely forgotten, leaving behind

554
00:39:53,840 --> 00:39:57,600
virtually no cultural impact whatsoever.

555
00:39:57,600 --> 00:40:03,240
Looking back now, just over a year later, it's almost like it never even existed.

556
00:40:03,240 --> 00:40:04,980
And maybe that's for the best.

557
00:40:04,980 --> 00:40:07,940
I'd call it a worthy sacrifice.

558
00:40:07,940 --> 00:40:12,320
Following the discouraging reception, Warner Bros. announced that they had no plans to

559
00:40:12,320 --> 00:40:15,060
continue the Matrix franchise.

560
00:40:15,060 --> 00:40:19,900
For the time being, it's at least one set of films that may finally be allowed to rest

561
00:40:19,900 --> 00:40:20,900
in peace.

562
00:40:20,900 --> 00:40:25,460
Hopefully, this whole situation can serve as a valuable lesson to the film industry

563
00:40:25,460 --> 00:40:28,400
that some things are better left in the past.

564
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:29,500
And who knows?

565
00:40:29,500 --> 00:40:34,560
There may come a day when original ideas once again reign supreme in Hollywood.

566
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:38,980
But until that happens, the whole system will be in desperate need of a de-boot.
