0	13920	Is it just me, or do movies these days feel… artificial?
13920	18800	And I'm not just referring to unconvincing acting or graphical shortcomings, I'm talking
18800	25180	about the whole experience, from beginning to end.
25180	29500	On the surface, the Hollywood blockbusters of today still look and sound like they used
29500	30500	to.
30500	34500	And if you're watching them half asleep or drunk, you may not be able to tell that
34500	36980	anything has changed at all.
36980	37980	But I don't know.
37980	42060	There's something about movies today that just feels… off.
42060	43940	Like they're missing something.
43940	52020	And while I don't know exactly when it began, I do know when I started feeling it.
52020	56600	Growing up in the 2000s, it seemed like every kid had a favorite franchise, whether it was
56600	60660	Harry Potter, Lord of the Rings, Yu-Gi-Oh!, Bionicle.
60660	65900	But for me, the fantasy world I called home would be found in a galaxy far, far away.
65900	71900	It may not be possible to describe just how big of a deal Star Wars was when I was younger.
71900	77240	The brand was in the midst of a cultural revival for a new generation, my generation.
77240	82240	The fanfare was practically inescapable, and boy did I get caught up in it.
82240	88200	My first taste came from the Lego Star Wars video game, and the rest was history.
88200	92720	Star Wars became the first fictional universe in which I was truly engrossed.
92720	96440	Studying the characters and lore became a personal obsession.
96440	100240	It got to the point where simply seeing a dude with a glowing stick was enough to get
100240	101520	me excited.
101520	104280	And I was far from the only one to feel this way.
104280	109160	It's impossible to truly describe just how much of a cultural phenomenon Star Wars was
109160	115800	at this time, and unlike many such events today, it never came off as forced or contrived.
115800	120320	The intense passion around the series came from a place of genuine reverence, one that
120320	123400	transcended space and time.
123400	128520	These days boomers and zoomers aren't exactly known to get along, but for a brief period
128520	131320	Star Wars managed to bring us together.
131320	136240	I still have fond memories of watching the original trilogy with my dad, and recognizing
136240	139480	that it was a meaningful experience for both of us.
139480	145160	I figured that one day, I would be able to pass on a cherished trilogy of my own.
145160	151280	Unfortunately, like most things in the modern age, it came with a catch.
151280	156080	It turned out that the new batch of Star Wars films didn't quite stack up to the originals,
156080	159040	and that George Lucas may have gone too far in a few places.
159200	161840	I may have gone too far in a few places.
161840	166520	As time went on, I began to realize just how flawed the prequels were.
166520	171280	Despite my overwhelming love for the franchise, I couldn't ignore the sinking feeling that
171280	173000	I'd been shortchanged.
173000	178440	I mean after all, for as pervasive as the Star Wars brand was, at the end of the day
178440	181780	it all depended on the success of the movies.
181780	187400	So with that being said, is it too much to ask for the movies to be, I don't know, good?
189080	191800	Passion and hype can only get you so far.
191800	196320	At some point, the underlying product has to be something worth celebrating.
196320	202240	It's tough to justify being a fan of a franchise when half the films are downright mediocre.
202240	208240	But no worries, Disney has come to save the day from that washed up hack, George Lucas.
208240	210400	Just look at how they turned around Marvel.
210400	212720	This thing is going to be a slam dunk.
212720	217180	They're going to come in, kick some ass, and make their own trilogy the right way.
217180	221880	And we can just go ahead and pretend that whole prequel fiasco never happened.
221880	226540	At long last, Star Wars is going to produce something I can actually be proud to call
226540	228300	myself a fan of.
228300	232620	Oh boy, if only I knew how bad things really were.
232620	247620	Over the next five years, I slowly came to grips with the absolute horror I was witnessing
247620	249820	unfold in front of me.
249820	255740	Not only were my greatest fears being realized, but it was worse than I ever could have imagined.
255740	260620	Somehow, despite their unfathomable wealth and resources, Disney managed to fumble the
260620	265180	bag on the most beloved IP in their entire company portfolio.
265180	268360	At first, I didn't want to believe it was happening.
268360	272560	After film two of the trilogy, things were looking grim.
272560	277280	But Star Wars teaches us to cling onto hope in these very situations.
277280	281160	So I did, for as long as I possibly could.
281160	286920	Then one dreary December day in 2019, I walked into some godforsaken theater in Jacksonville
286920	293480	to witness the defining franchise of my childhood meet its bitter and unforgivable end.
293480	296680	Some people actually liked this movie.
296680	298040	That's good for them.
298040	299400	I didn't.
299400	304640	In fact, I can confidently say that no other film for as long as I live will possibly make
304640	310040	me feel the level of shame, betrayal, and hostility as I did in that moment.
310040	314320	I believe it was during the scene where the heroes are fighting the heavily armed space
314320	319080	fleet on horseback when I really started rethinking my life choices.
319080	321240	Star Wars, as I knew it, was dead.
321240	326840	It was something I had suspected all along, and by now, there was no more childhood naivete
326840	328560	to cushion the blow.
328560	333680	It dawned on me that all those years I had spent as a diehard fan had meant absolutely
333680	334680	nothing.
334680	338920	I felt like such a fool for convincing myself that there would be any sort of payoff for
338920	342400	the emotional investment I poured into this franchise.
342400	346920	I no longer cared about the story, the characters, anything.
346920	352000	All of a sudden, I wanted nothing to do with the series I loved for my entire life.
352000	354640	This movie made me hate Star Wars.
354640	358840	It made me question why I even watched movies in the first place.
358840	365320	After that dark day, my first love in cinema had been totally and unequivocally ruined.
365320	368080	But luckily for me, there was another.
426320	429040	Uh, I don't think you should be investing in companies like-
429040	431040	Hey, you like the Spoke Post?
431040	432040	Yeah, of course.
432040	435320	They sent me this great camping chair, the parked box.
435320	440840	It's great for when you're camping out to be the first in line to one of the greatest
440840	442720	movie sensations of the year.
442720	448800	Of course, what good is camping out for the movie without some nice, delicious movie theater
448800	449800	popcorn?
450800	456280	Of course, I have a concealed in the middle of the Spoke Post Weekender Travel Bag.
456280	460960	Why go through the trouble of sneaking in popcorn if you don't also have your nice little
460960	462560	container of soda?
462560	468480	And with Bespoke's Cask Box, you too can have delicious popcorn refreshment and refreshing
468480	472440	soda to watch your favorite movie event of the year.

496880	501280	I don't know, it seems kind of unethical to sneak your snacks into the theater.
501280	506320	I mean, if everyone started doing that, it might cause them to start going out of business.
507320	512480	Well, you know, Rough G, after a while, the prices in there, they're just not a good
512480	514200	value anymore.

528240	530800	Don't you think you should go back and start working on your videos?
530800	534960	Can you stop asking completely reasonable questions?

544800	548720	Man, they sure do seem to be taking a while.
548720	551080	I wonder what's the holdup?
551080	553960	You think it has something to do with the quality of the movie industry?
553960	554960	I don't know what you mean by that.
554960	557640	There's been tons of great hits in the past few years.
557640	560640	Titanic, Jurassic Park, Die Hard.
560640	563200	Seems like the industry's doing better than it's ever been.
563240	564960	Emp, you're not making any sense.
564960	565960	What are you talking about?
565960	568400	Have you been living under a rock?
568400	574960	It's the biggest movie in history, the follow-up to the most beloved trilogy of all time.
574960	575960	Hello?
575960	576960	Hello?
576960	579320	I don't understand.
579320	581120	The premiere's just in a couple days.
581120	582120	Why is nobody here?
582120	583440	Why is nobody waiting?
583440	585940	Emp, you have to relax, all right?
585940	587160	You're acting erratic.
587160	589280	Everything you're saying makes no sense.
589280	591560	Titanic, Die Hard, Jurassic Park.
591560	595640	Those movies haven't been popular for over 20 years.
595640	597040	What did you just say?
597040	603280	Yeah, those movies have not been popular for over 20 years.
603280	606480	You can't be serious.
606480	617360	Rusty, what year is it?
617360	623000	Star Wars Downward Spiral can be traced all the way back to the May of 1999 and the release
623000	628920	of The Phantom Menace, which many fans attribute as the kiss of death for the brand.
628920	633880	Just a few weeks prior, a different sci-fi franchise had sprung to life.
633880	638840	It is the world that has been pulled over your eyes to blind you from the truth.
638840	642520	The Matrix made itself known as the surprise of the year.
642520	646920	It burst out of the gates, setting the box office record for an April release.
646920	652000	For a film that was only sparingly marketed, its meteoric success had seemingly come out
652000	653440	of nowhere.
653440	657300	Lead actor Keanu Reeves was mostly unknown at the time.
657300	661880	Even less known were the film's enigmatic directors, the Wachowskis.
661880	666020	Whoever they were, they'd captured lightning in a bottle.
666020	669720	Audiences were being drawn in by nothing more than pure intrigue.
669720	673300	The Matrix packed the theaters for one simple reason.
673300	675900	No one had ever seen anything like it.
675900	678900	It was ambitious, innovative, and salient.
678900	683340	It pioneered such revolutionary techniques in filmmaking that its influence is still
683340	684980	felt today.
684980	690220	But what truly set The Matrix apart from the competition was its philosophical depth.
690220	696260	For many, it represented the ultimate exploration of one of modern man's deepest fears.
696260	700340	The year 1999 seems to come up a lot in my videos.
700340	705100	I have come to view it as this inflection point in the trajectory of modern society,
705100	709780	after which everything seems to have taken an ominous turn for the worse.
709780	712720	Turns out the future ain't quite what it's cracked up to be.
712720	717640	And while dystopian visions of tomorrow were nothing new, the one presented by The Matrix
717640	720520	is exceptionally bleak.
720520	723900	Human beings have forever been defined by technology.
723900	728940	Our ability to transform natural elements into complex tools is what separates us from
728940	731160	the rest of the animal kingdom.
731160	736440	But somewhere along the way, tools became a little too complex, and we started calling
736440	739520	them something else—machines.
739520	744280	While it's difficult to pinpoint exactly when this shift occurred, it seemed to coincide
744280	748540	with a time when technology started to feel intimidating.
748540	753560	This sentiment became apparent at the start of the Industrial Revolution, when machines
753560	755800	began replacing us.
755800	760800	Perhaps the first conflict between man and machine can be traced back to an 18th century
760800	766680	weaver named Ned Ludd, who, according to legend, smashed a pair of knitting racks in a fit
766680	767680	of rage.
767680	774000	By the 19th century, technology had begun to transform the entire textile industry.
774000	778600	Skilled artisans were now being undercut by automated factories which could output similar
778600	781200	goods at a much lower expense.
781200	787080	In 1811, the disenfranchised started lashing out against their mechanical oppressors.
787080	794000	Taking after the story of Ned Ludd, this anti-technology faction would soon become known as the Luddites.
794000	799480	The movement wouldn't last long, as the military soon cracked down on the insubordination.
799480	804360	In time, the cultural consensus would go on to look back on the Luddites derisively,
804360	809200	viewing them as an irrational hindrance to the natural pursuit of progress.
809200	812840	After all, automation ends up benefiting everyone else.
812840	817640	If someone ends up losing their job because of it, they're just taking one for the team.
817640	822200	It was easy for all sorts of people to think this way, until all of a sudden, they were
822200	824960	the ones getting replaced.
824960	830820	As technology continued to rapidly advance, concerns over automation began to appear in
830820	832120	fiction.
832120	836920	The American folktale of John Henry was notably one of the first of its kind to feature a
836920	839320	machine as an antagonist.
839320	844440	The legend tells the story of a railroad worker who drops dead after racing a steam-powered
844440	845740	drill.
845740	850200	Later depictions of a machine-powered future would only get more grim.
850200	856560	The 1927 film Metropolis presented the first depiction of a post-industrial dystopia.
856560	861600	It laid the groundwork for what would eventually become known as the cyberpunk genre, a new
861600	867400	wave in science fiction which expressed hesitancy to the rapid expansion of technology.
867400	873640	It envisioned a future in which the pervasiveness of machines would oppress and suffocate mankind.
873640	879360	While concerns of technology primarily focused on its omnipresence, others foresaw an additional
879360	881660	threat in its intelligence.
881660	886720	In the midst of its bionic world, Metropolis featured one of the first concepts of a bionic
886720	890400	man, which we now refer to as robots.
890400	894720	They represented an acknowledgement that somewhere ahead on the horizon, machines could
894720	899280	eventually match and even surpass the capacities of human beings.
899280	903840	In the 20th century, much of the pioneering literature about robots would be explored
903840	906600	by sci-fi author Isaac Asimov.
906600	911480	He is perhaps best known for coining the three laws of robotics, which sought to address
911480	916760	the most immediate threat that life-sized automatons may evoke, the prospect of them
916760	918640	turning on their masters.
918880	923800	Asimov's work was compelling, especially during a time period which gave rise to the
923800	926160	very first computers.
926160	931560	All of a sudden, the idea of intelligent machines was spilling into reality, although at this
931560	935120	point, it hardly resembled anything human.
935120	941040	The original computers were almost Lovecraftian, an incomprehensible wall of electronic components
941040	946860	that, by some terrifying miracle, were capable of mimicking the foundational elements of
946860	947860	thought.
948100	953780	Contrary to their initial humanoid depictions, computers were practically formless.
953780	958180	They could theoretically take on the appearance of anything we could imagine.
958180	963140	The film 2001 A Space Odyssey would introduce the first landmark appearance of artificial
963140	965220	intelligence in cinema.
965220	971340	The cold and calculating HAL 9000 would unnerve audiences for decades to come.
971340	976340	Director Stanley Kubrick reimagined the machine antagonist as more than a single threatening
976340	977340	entity.
977340	981900	Rather, one which served as a hostile extension of the setting itself.
981900	985340	This idea would be expanded on further by the artist H.R.
985340	991140	Geiger, who produced nightmarish illustrations of living things being smothered by an all-encompassing
991140	993440	mechanical environment.
993440	998740	In 1973, he would create one of his most notable works while collaborating with the progressive
998740	1001260	rock band Emerson Lake & Palmer.
1001260	1006700	The group was finishing their new album Brain Salad Surgery, which depicts an epic war between
1006700	1008800	humans and computers.
1008800	1014180	While listening through, Geiger composed what would eventually become the album's artwork.
1014180	1021060	An outer cover featuring a sterile metal sarcophagus, which opens to reveal a lobotomized woman.
1021060	1026100	While Geiger envisioned a physical convergence between man and machine, sci-fi author Philip
1026100	1029020	K. Dick took a more conceptual approach.
1029020	1034460	His 1968 novel Due Android's Dream of Electric Sheep features human-like replicants who are
1034460	1038220	practically indistinguishable from biological men.
1038220	1043400	This premise would later be adapted into the 1982 film Blade Runner, where the corruptive
1043400	1049280	influence of technology has expanded to threaten our perception of reality itself.
1049280	1054620	By this time, computers were being welcomed into people's homes, and the advent of a virtual
1054620	1058740	reality was no longer a question of if, but when.
1058740	1063760	The rapid acceleration of computing power began to fuel theories of a potential technological
1063760	1069880	singularity on the horizon, in which super-intelligent machines could achieve god-like abilities,
1069880	1072960	thus rendering all of mankind obsolete.
1072960	1077840	At the same time, fictional works began to push the concept of machine warfare to its
1077840	1079620	absolute limit.
1079620	1085780	If a confrontation between humans and machines did arise, just how bad could things get?
1085780	1090480	The Terminator franchise envisioned the human race being driven to the brink of extinction
1090480	1096620	by nuclear hellfire, a somber outcome indeed, but one which many would find preferable to
1096620	1099800	the scenario depicted by The Matrix.
1099800	1105180	In a world where mankind has long since lost its war against the machines, human beings
1105180	1111480	have been forced into a fate worse than death, a state of total submission in which our homeostatic
1111480	1115280	energy is harvested to power the machine world.
1115280	1121100	The collective human consciousness is imprisoned and pacified by a lifelike simulation.
1121100	1126200	This premise is very much reminiscent of Plato's allegory of the cave, an age-old metaphor
1126200	1129280	about the nature of truth and objectivity.
1129280	1134080	It seeks to highlight philosophical enlightenment as the pathway to salvation.
1134080	1138600	But of course, that's to assume that whatever's waiting for us outside the cave is actually
1138600	1140120	worth the journey.
1140120	1144820	Coincidentally, one year before the debut of The Matrix, an entirely different film
1144860	1149260	had already explored the premise of escaping from a false reality.
1149260	1153860	And while we never see what happens to Truman after he breaks free of the simulation, it's
1153860	1157020	implied that he's gone to a better place.
1157020	1160600	In The Matrix, however, the decision is not as clear.
1160600	1165440	It's human nature to seek out truth, but does there come a point when the truth is so ugly
1165440	1168160	that we'd be better off not knowing at all?
1168160	1173480	How many of us would choose to remain in the cave if we knew the horrors that lay beyond it?
1173520	1177840	Perhaps it would be better for us to simply stay put and play it safe.
1177840	1181000	But the story of humanity would indicate otherwise.
1181000	1186540	It goes against human nature to remain imprisoned in both a cave and a simulation, for the simple
1186540	1189340	reason that it undermines our autonomy.
1189340	1194920	For just as technology defines mankind, so too does self-determination.
1194920	1199720	The idea that we are the masters of our own destiny, that our decisions are the product
1199720	1203840	of free will, and not some pre-programmed directive.
1203840	1207940	In this way, we are distinct from both animals and machines.
1207940	1213340	Human beings aren't required to behave in ways that are entirely instinctual nor logical.
1213340	1218460	While computers may one day reach a level of intellect magnitudes higher than our own,
1218460	1222960	it's unclear whether they will ever be able to truly think like us.
1222960	1228520	Choice is unmistakably human, even if those choices often aren't the most rational.
1228520	1232560	It's for this reason why Neo is such an engaging protagonist.
1232560	1237440	His journey relies on regaining the right to choose, no matter the monumentality of
1237440	1239640	the system standing in his way.
1239640	1244980	Audiences couldn't help but relate to Neo's story, especially during a time when so many
1244980	1248280	of us were losing our autonomy.
1248280	1253120	The 20th century was marked by the rise and fall of totalitarian regimes.
1253120	1257380	The collapse of the Soviet Union was supposed to signal the dawning of a new era in which
1257380	1261900	the people of the world could finally exist as liberated citizens.
1261900	1267460	The 90s were generally regarded as a time of idealistic optimism for the future, a sentiment
1267460	1272820	which was nonetheless undercut by the ominous feeling that something was not quite right,
1272820	1278220	that the so-called free society we were inhabiting didn't exactly come as advertised.
1278220	1282840	There's a scene in The Matrix where Agent Smith explains why the machines chose to simulate
1282840	1284980	the year 1999.
1284980	1288260	He describes it as the peak of civilization.
1288260	1292900	Obviously the setting was intended to match the contemporary release of the film, but
1292900	1298300	it's eerie to look back on that line today and realize just how true it still rings.
1298300	1304140	While the machines canonically intended to pass off the year 1999 as a convincing reality,
1304140	1308500	it ironically marked a point when everything started to feel artificial.
1308500	1314600	The late 20th century saw the rise of a different kind of machine, the corporate machine, financial
1314600	1319720	behemoths whose influence grew to rival the most dominant empires in history.
1319720	1325080	These man-made entities have very much become the monolithic overlords of the present day,
1325080	1328520	and they've been actively twisting the reality around us.
1328520	1334240	It was hard to notice at first, everything seemed so normal, but eventually the anomalies
1334240	1337160	just became too much to ignore.
1337160	1342160	Despite all the concerns of machines acting like us, no one could anticipate just how
1342160	1345480	much we would start acting like machines.
1345480	1350040	It's strange to consider how one of the original worries about automation had to do with it
1350040	1352560	providing us too much leisure.
1352560	1356360	If that was ever the case, we surely haven't seen any of it.
1356360	1360400	In fact, there's an argument to be made that the average person today is doing more
1360400	1363600	work than at any other time in recent history.
1363600	1369480	Simultaneously, the nature of that work has only become more robotic and dehumanizing.
1369480	1374760	The ruthless efficiency of the labor market has rendered individuality almost worthless.
1374760	1378280	You either fit in to the preordained system or you don't.
1378280	1380880	Either way, you're just another cog.
1380880	1385040	The fruits of your labor serve no greater philosophical purpose.
1385040	1389800	You can't help but get a little existential when it feels like everything you do is meaningless.
1389800	1394480	It's a feeling that now extends far beyond the office cubicle.
1394480	1399600	The relentless thirst for profit has expanded to pervade nearly all walks of life.
1399600	1404480	Much like the fate of humans in the Matrix, modern consumers are created and harvested
1404480	1408880	to feed some inescapable system that we will never comprehend.
1408880	1413000	And although we've found ourselves with no shortage of things to buy, it's somewhat
1413000	1417860	shocking just how limited our options have become pretty much everywhere else.
1417860	1422400	If you've ever wanted to experience how it feels to be in the Matrix, look no further
1422400	1451880	than the very industry from which it came.
1451880	1455960	It seems like these days, everything has to be a franchise.
1455960	1460900	Because while a standalone film is limited to its moment in the sun, a cinematic universe
1460900	1463900	can be milked until the sun stops shining.
1463900	1469220	Why allow something to die when you can keep it in a perpetual state of suspended animation,
1469220	1473720	siphoning off every last drop of whatever made it so alive in the first place?
1473720	1478300	The Matrix, of course, had its share of sequels, which never quite reached the acclaim of the
1478300	1479300	original.
1479460	1484180	While they have been criticized for being a tad too cryptic and incoherent at times,
1484180	1488200	there was never any doubt over whether they deserved to be made at all.
1488200	1492720	Each of them represented a clear artistic vision and continued the story in a meaningful
1492720	1493720	way.
1493720	1498120	They served a purpose beyond being a shameless cash grab.
1498120	1504600	2019 marked 20 years since the release of The Matrix, and much had changed since then.
1504600	1508880	Keanu Reeves moved on to an entirely new action franchise.
1508880	1514300	The Wachowski brothers were now the Wachowski sisters, and the film industry had mutated
1514300	1517380	into an almost unrecognizable wasteland.
1517380	1522940	Gone were the days of the ambitious auteurs who defined Hollywood's greatest hits.
1522940	1527420	Modern blockbusters now view ambition as an unnecessary risk.
1527420	1532700	Turns out that film studios had become 20 years smarter at making movies profitable.
1532700	1537040	The first Matrix film wound up making Warner Bros nearly half a billion dollars at the
1537040	1541600	box office, which was almost eight times their initial investment.
1541600	1545900	This remarkable financial success makes it all the more baffling to consider that had
1545900	1549700	it been pitched today, The Matrix would have probably never been made.
1549700	1554740	I mean, if you really think about it, when was the last time any major Hollywood studio
1554740	1557580	rolled the dice on an unproven concept?
1557580	1563060	Could an R-rated blockbuster with such esoteric themes even exist nowadays?
1563080	1568340	This used to be some place you'd go to witness something truly spectacular, but lately, every
1568340	1572880	aspect of the industry has been on a steady march towards mediocrity.
1572880	1578540	Twitter user Eric Krebs helped visualize the stark decline of originality in Hollywood.
1578540	1583840	It's now common for the top ten grossing films of the year to be entirely composed of recycled
1583840	1586860	concepts from pre-existing source material.
1586860	1592000	The superhero genre alone, which The Matrix ironically helped inspire, has ballooned to
1592020	1595460	fill up nearly half of all Blockbuster's release.
1595460	1601500	The number of R-rated films has been gutted to make way for the far more marketable PG-13,
1601500	1607160	a format which neuters the filmmaker's ability to explore sophisticated ideas.
1607160	1612580	The once promising field of computer graphics now comes off far more as a crutch for overworked
1612580	1616780	productions who can't be bothered to compose an actual scene.
1616780	1622280	The Hollywood simulation is now almost entirely dependent on machines, and the results are
1622280	1625480	just as uninspiring as you may have guessed.
1625480	1630220	It seems like every big-budget film today, no matter who directed it or which studio
1630220	1635920	backed it, now looks like the same bland and homogenous visual sludge.
1635920	1640520	There is a disturbing lack of humanity in modern-day blockbusters.
1640520	1645200	Creative control has been wrestled away from filmmakers and placed in the hands of bureaucratic
1645260	1651260	committees who audit every decision in the production process over its financial sensibility.
1651260	1656080	Anything remotely nuanced or edgy is generally not advisable.
1656080	1660940	Movies are now expected to be international events and should in no way touch on any issues
1660940	1665100	that may marginally offend anyone on the opposite side of the globe.
1665100	1670260	For an industry once renowned for its limitless possibilities, it's disheartening to see
1670260	1674420	so much of cinema now defined by what you can't do.
1674420	1678720	The craft of filmmaking has been streamlined from an art to a science.
1678720	1683540	Major releases no longer feel like an organic exercise in creativity.
1683540	1687380	They feel like the product of a heavily controlled formula.
1687380	1692440	Much like a rollercoaster, they're designed to offer the impression of a dire situation,
1692440	1695840	while all along you were never in any real danger.
1695840	1700260	After it's all said and done, you always wind up right back where you started.
1700260	1702480	You haven't really gone anywhere.
1702480	1704760	Why allow the heroes to fail?
1704760	1708020	Why allow a fan favorite character to truly die?
1708020	1711420	Why allow the guy to not get the girl in the end?
1711420	1716260	Sure, doing so might produce a moment that's actually meaningful, but that would imply
1716260	1720760	that movies can tell a story that's even remotely complex.
1720760	1726560	It's as if Hollywood is no longer capable of producing stories which are actually satisfying.
1726560	1731340	They instead come off as a disparate patchwork of amusement with very little substance or
1731340	1734240	cohesion holding anything together.
1734240	1738160	It's like going to a restaurant expecting a gourmet meal and getting served a plate
1738160	1739160	of candy.
1739160	1744200	Sure, it sets off all the right receptors, but rather than making you feel full, it just
1744200	1745780	makes you sick.
1745780	1751000	And the sickening sweetness of movies today is delivered through meaningless nostalgia,
1751000	1757440	assaulting the audience with a nauseating barrage of familiar faces, places, and sounds.
1757440	1762200	Movies now go so far as to resurrect the dead just to keep the same old song and dance
1762200	1767360	going, as part of some desperate ploy to remind us of a time when movies actually made us
1767360	1769140	feel something.
1769140	1771360	Some of us aren't fooled, however.
1771360	1777440	We know that we're not living in 1999 anymore and recognize the product on screen as a hollow
1777440	1781880	imitation, only resembling the original superficially.
1781880	1788120	Just like a machine, it has no soul, and it replaced whatever was alive long ago.
1788120	1790680	Such is the fate of the modern franchise.
1790680	1797420	It happened to Star Wars, and soon enough, it would happen with The Matrix 2.
1797420	1802580	These days it seems like no entertainment property is safe from the dreaded reboot.
1802580	1807600	As the pool of original ideas has dried up, Hollywood has determined that it's now far
1807600	1812980	more cost-effective to simply regurgitate existing brands from a bygone era.
1812980	1818000	While the uninitiated may feel excited to reunite with that special friend, it's important
1818000	1822120	to realize what exactly made it so special in the first place.
1822120	1827420	Surely it wasn't geriatric celebrities trying and failing to relive the glory days, nor
1827420	1832980	was it a bubble-wrapped and sanitized retelling of a story we've already heard before.
1832980	1839160	How about the nonsensical addition of a marketable character whose only purpose is to drive toy sales?
1839160	1843860	If you ask me, the vast majority of rebooted franchises would have been far better off
1843860	1845460	staying dead.
1845460	1848700	They aren't interested in selling a quality product.
1848700	1850700	All they're selling is a legacy.
1850700	1856900	A legacy which stands to be actively tarnished by whatever vapid slop is being pumped out today.
1856900	1858300	But what can I say?
1858300	1863020	There's a reason why shameless pandering sequels continue to flood the market.
1863020	1865020	People keep paying to see them.
1865020	1869660	It's almost as if modern consumers have been conditioned to accept nothing more.
1869660	1872820	To be content with middling disappointment.
1872820	1879500	Reboots have become inevitable, and studios are now hungry to defile the graves of long-dead franchises.
1879500	1884880	Naturally, it was only a matter of time before The Matrix was next on the chopping block.
1884880	1890420	It was the end of 2019, right around the time Star Wars got sent to the glue factory,
1890420	1893600	when news came out that The Matrix was next.
1893600	1897680	Warner Bros. wanted a fourth installment to the series, and they were gonna make it with
1897680	1899920	or without the Wachowskis.
1899920	1906520	The thing is, there already was a fourth Matrix film, the excellent and often overlooked Animatrix,
1906520	1910560	an anthology of short stories set in the Matrix universe.
1910560	1914200	It was a supplemental release that truly deserved to be made.
1914200	1918840	One curated by the Wachowskis to celebrate the spirit of the originals by opening it
1918840	1921600	up to the interpretations of others.
1921600	1926440	The stories within were imaginative, dynamic, and stylistically vibrant.
1926440	1932180	A fitting send-off to a project which placed so much emphasis on free expression.
1932180	1934720	If only it was that simple.
1934720	1939800	Warner Bros. could sense that The Matrix brand still had quite a bit of money left in it.
1939800	1941660	Everything else was getting rebooted.
1941660	1943240	Why not The Matrix?
1943240	1947360	It didn't matter that the story had already reached its logical conclusion.
1947360	1951640	They had tickets to sell, as well as a sleek new streaming service.
1951640	1955120	The studio basically gave the Wachowskis an ultimatum.
1955120	1960020	They could either oversee the spiritual death of their brainchild, or hand the job over
1960020	1961760	to someone else.
1961760	1966600	Either way, the defining achievement of their lives would be turned into an abject mockery
1966600	1968780	of everything it once stood for.
1968780	1972920	Upon hearing the news, Lily Wachowski wanted nothing to do with it.
1972920	1979600	So that just left Lana to figure out how to defeat The Matrix once and for all.
1979600	1983660	So what do you do if you're being forced into a movie you don't want to make?
1983660	1988500	Well, believe it or not, the wisdom of how to handle the fate of one of Hollywood's
1988500	1992740	most acclaimed enterprises could be found in one of its least.
1992740	1998460	And it was all made possible by, coincidentally, an unlikely hero named Tom.
1998460	2005220	1999 would mark the big break for comedian Tom Green, who landed a new show on MTV.
2005220	2010340	He soon established himself as a pioneer of shock humor and the socially uncomfortable,
2010340	2014660	serving as the progenitor for some of the most popular comedy today.
2014660	2018660	Tom was very much ahead of the curve, in more ways than one.
2018660	2023740	Because in 2001, he would produce something so avant-garde that we have only just begun
2023740	2025420	to appreciate it.
2025420	2028660	What is the most disgusting film of 2001?
2028660	2033340	The champion is Freddy Got Fingered with Tom Green making David Spade look like Jim Carrey
2033340	2036220	and Jim Carrey look like Laurence Olivier.
2036220	2041260	Accounts differ depending on who you ask, but legend has it, Tom was required to make
2041260	2045740	a movie against his will due to some contractual dispute with the studio.
2045740	2051340	20th Century Fox would end up getting their movie, but the comedian would have the last laugh.
2051340	2056780	The result was Freddy Got Fingered, a film so diabolically awful that it all feels like
2056780	2058740	one big practical joke.
2058740	2063740	Perhaps no other movie out there expresses such contempt for the Hollywood system.
2063740	2067660	It literally tells the story of an artist wasting the studio's money.
2067660	2069500	There's a million dollars gone.
2069500	2071420	Easy come, easy go.
2071420	2079140	And while he's not exactly Neo, he is portrayed as a self-aware person trapped inside a contrived reality.
2079140	2083740	At the time of its release, nobody really understood what the film was about.
2083740	2088100	It went on to become one of the most critically panned movies of this century.
2088100	2093220	Tom Green proudly accepted his five Razzie awards, reportedly having to be dragged off
2093220	2098620	stage after breaking out a never-ending harmonica solo during its acceptance speech.
2098620	2100780	It just didn't make any sense.
2100780	2103220	Everyone dreams of being a movie star.
2103220	2107100	To be given such an opportunity should be considered a great honor.
2107140	2112900	Why would someone just throw it all away like that and turn the whole thing into a laughingstock?
2112900	2116780	How could anyone willingly attach their name to something so embarrassing?
2116780	2121140	Well, you have to remember that Tom Green was ahead of the curve.
2121140	2126180	Maybe he knew what the film industry would become and saw the way out.
2126180	2130940	Turns out the best way to defeat the Hollywood machine was giving the studio the finger.
2130940	2133180	Hi, this is my painting that I made.
2133180	2134820	It's called Tiger Zebra.
2134860	2137940	I worked really, really hard on it, and now I'm going to go put it up in the National
2137940	2141540	Art Gallery, because that's where all the really, really good paintings go, and I want
2141540	2145740	mine to be seen by all the people that appreciate really, really good art like this.
2149580	2154980	In December of 2021, I returned to another Jacksonville theater fully preparing to be
2154980	2157900	debilitated by another hideous sequel.
2157900	2162440	But what I ended up witnessing instead was unlike anything I could have expected.
2162440	2168300	In many ways, what I saw that day was very much a terrible end to a beloved franchise.
2168300	2173740	From a nonsensical and immersion-shattering plot to goofy, dumbed-down characters.
2173740	2179840	A film stuffed to the brim with baffling moments like Neo watching the first Matrix on a projector,
2179840	2183640	pouring a container of blue pills into his mouth, and a strawberry.
2183640	2185660	A strawberry?
2185660	2190960	At first glance, it looked to be yet another Rise of Skywalker, but something felt different
2190960	2191960	this time around.
2192000	2196760	Nothing comforts anxiety like a little nostalgia.
2196760	2202760	The Matrix Resurrections was a film so aggressively idiotic that it seemed almost deliberate.
2202760	2207260	As if the creators were attempting to weaponize their own stupidity.
2207260	2208560	And then it hit me.
2208560	2211120	This wasn't just a sequel to The Matrix.
2211120	2214000	It was a sequel to Freddy Got Fingered.
2214000	2217120	It was a movie about not wanting to make a movie.
2217120	2221920	I'm sure you can understand why our beloved parent company, Warner Brothers, has decided
2221920	2224280	to make a sequel to the trilogy.
2224280	2230160	Only this time, instead of wasting a paltry 14 million of studio funding, The Matrix Resurrections
2230160	2233560	managed to squander more than 10 times that.
2233560	2238840	If the creators did choose to sabotage the film in that way, then it may very well be
2238840	2242040	one of the most expensive jokes ever told.
2242040	2246340	A Matrix reboot was always going to be an artistic failure.
2246340	2249980	And as well make that failure an inside job.
2253860	2256720	But perhaps you think I'm giving them too much credit.
2256720	2260460	That it's just another mediocre piece of crap like all the rest.
2260460	2264740	Maybe Lana Wachowski, like many directors, ran out of talent.
2264740	2268340	And The Matrix Resurrections was a genuine attempt.
2268340	2272460	As far as any of us are concerned, that's the official explanation.
2272460	2273460	But I don't know.
2273460	2278820	I'd like to believe that for once, a shameless Hollywood reboot actually meant something.
2278820	2282660	That it was more than just another big fat waste of time.
2282660	2287700	Make no mistake about it, what I saw that day was an undeniable train wreck.
2287700	2290220	But it was somehow beautiful.
2290220	2293460	Not for what it was, but for what it represented.
2293460	2298140	Sitting there in the theater on that December afternoon, I felt oddly vindicated.
2298140	2303060	Like all the grief I suffered from The Rise of Skywalker had suddenly lifted.
2303060	2307740	At the end of the day, both Star Wars and The Matrix tell a similar story.
2307740	2312760	They offer us tales of a great hero rebelling against oppressive machinery.
2312760	2318140	And while Star Wars was eventually tempted to the dark side, The Matrix remained defiant
2318140	2320120	until the very end.
2320120	2324660	It may have met a bitter fate, but it was one which nonetheless remained under control
2324660	2326160	of the artist.
2326160	2330540	In this regard, it was honorable, even in defeat.
2330540	2335000	When faced with the death of their legacy, the creators still had enough dignity to go
2335000	2336920	down with the ship.
2336920	2339340	They informed me they're gonna do it with or without us.
2339340	2342080	And they made it clear they'll kill our contract if we don't cooperate.
2342080	2347680	I know you said the story was over for you, but that's the thing about stories.
2347680	2349480	They never really end, do they?
2349480	2354160	We're still telling the same stories we've always told, just with different names, different
2354160	2356260	faces.
2356260	2359320	The sheeple aren't going anywhere.
2359320	2360320	They like my world.
2360320	2362740	They don't want freedom or empowerment.
2362740	2364840	They want to be controlled.
2364840	2366960	They crave the comfort of certainty.
2366960	2377880	And that means you two back in your pods, unconscious and alone, just like them.
2377880	2382480	The Matrix resurrections will go down in history as a commercial failure.
2382480	2388760	With losses in excess of $30 million, it will forever be known as a box office bomb.
2388760	2393840	After just a few weeks, the whole thing was almost completely forgotten, leaving behind
2393840	2397600	virtually no cultural impact whatsoever.
2397600	2403240	Looking back now, just over a year later, it's almost like it never even existed.
2403240	2404980	And maybe that's for the best.
2404980	2407940	I'd call it a worthy sacrifice.
2407940	2412320	Following the discouraging reception, Warner Bros. announced that they had no plans to
2412320	2415060	continue the Matrix franchise.
2415060	2419900	For the time being, it's at least one set of films that may finally be allowed to rest
2419900	2420900	in peace.
2420900	2425460	Hopefully, this whole situation can serve as a valuable lesson to the film industry
2425460	2428400	that some things are better left in the past.
2428400	2429500	And who knows?
2429500	2434560	There may come a day when original ideas once again reign supreme in Hollywood.
2434560	2438980	But until that happens, the whole system will be in desperate need of a de-boot.
