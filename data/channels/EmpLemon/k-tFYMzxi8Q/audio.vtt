00:00.000 --> 00:13.920
Is it just me, or do movies these days feel… artificial?

00:13.920 --> 00:18.800
And I'm not just referring to unconvincing acting or graphical shortcomings, I'm talking

00:18.800 --> 00:25.180
about the whole experience, from beginning to end.

00:25.180 --> 00:29.500
On the surface, the Hollywood blockbusters of today still look and sound like they used

00:29.500 --> 00:30.500
to.

00:30.500 --> 00:34.500
And if you're watching them half asleep or drunk, you may not be able to tell that

00:34.500 --> 00:36.980
anything has changed at all.

00:36.980 --> 00:37.980
But I don't know.

00:37.980 --> 00:42.060
There's something about movies today that just feels… off.

00:42.060 --> 00:43.940
Like they're missing something.

00:43.940 --> 00:52.020
And while I don't know exactly when it began, I do know when I started feeling it.

00:52.020 --> 00:56.600
Growing up in the 2000s, it seemed like every kid had a favorite franchise, whether it was

00:56.600 --> 01:00.660
Harry Potter, Lord of the Rings, Yu-Gi-Oh!, Bionicle.

01:00.660 --> 01:05.900
But for me, the fantasy world I called home would be found in a galaxy far, far away.

01:05.900 --> 01:11.900
It may not be possible to describe just how big of a deal Star Wars was when I was younger.

01:11.900 --> 01:17.240
The brand was in the midst of a cultural revival for a new generation, my generation.

01:17.240 --> 01:22.240
The fanfare was practically inescapable, and boy did I get caught up in it.

01:22.240 --> 01:28.200
My first taste came from the Lego Star Wars video game, and the rest was history.

01:28.200 --> 01:32.720
Star Wars became the first fictional universe in which I was truly engrossed.

01:32.720 --> 01:36.440
Studying the characters and lore became a personal obsession.

01:36.440 --> 01:40.240
It got to the point where simply seeing a dude with a glowing stick was enough to get

01:40.240 --> 01:41.520
me excited.

01:41.520 --> 01:44.280
And I was far from the only one to feel this way.

01:44.280 --> 01:49.160
It's impossible to truly describe just how much of a cultural phenomenon Star Wars was

01:49.160 --> 01:55.800
at this time, and unlike many such events today, it never came off as forced or contrived.

01:55.800 --> 02:00.320
The intense passion around the series came from a place of genuine reverence, one that

02:00.320 --> 02:03.400
transcended space and time.

02:03.400 --> 02:08.520
These days boomers and zoomers aren't exactly known to get along, but for a brief period

02:08.520 --> 02:11.320
Star Wars managed to bring us together.

02:11.320 --> 02:16.240
I still have fond memories of watching the original trilogy with my dad, and recognizing

02:16.240 --> 02:19.480
that it was a meaningful experience for both of us.

02:19.480 --> 02:25.160
I figured that one day, I would be able to pass on a cherished trilogy of my own.

02:25.160 --> 02:31.280
Unfortunately, like most things in the modern age, it came with a catch.

02:31.280 --> 02:36.080
It turned out that the new batch of Star Wars films didn't quite stack up to the originals,

02:36.080 --> 02:39.040
and that George Lucas may have gone too far in a few places.

02:39.200 --> 02:41.840
I may have gone too far in a few places.

02:41.840 --> 02:46.520
As time went on, I began to realize just how flawed the prequels were.

02:46.520 --> 02:51.280
Despite my overwhelming love for the franchise, I couldn't ignore the sinking feeling that

02:51.280 --> 02:53.000
I'd been shortchanged.

02:53.000 --> 02:58.440
I mean after all, for as pervasive as the Star Wars brand was, at the end of the day

02:58.440 --> 03:01.780
it all depended on the success of the movies.

03:01.780 --> 03:07.400
So with that being said, is it too much to ask for the movies to be, I don't know, good?

03:09.080 --> 03:11.800
Passion and hype can only get you so far.

03:11.800 --> 03:16.320
At some point, the underlying product has to be something worth celebrating.

03:16.320 --> 03:22.240
It's tough to justify being a fan of a franchise when half the films are downright mediocre.

03:22.240 --> 03:28.240
But no worries, Disney has come to save the day from that washed up hack, George Lucas.

03:28.240 --> 03:30.400
Just look at how they turned around Marvel.

03:30.400 --> 03:32.720
This thing is going to be a slam dunk.

03:32.720 --> 03:37.180
They're going to come in, kick some ass, and make their own trilogy the right way.

03:37.180 --> 03:41.880
And we can just go ahead and pretend that whole prequel fiasco never happened.

03:41.880 --> 03:46.540
At long last, Star Wars is going to produce something I can actually be proud to call

03:46.540 --> 03:48.300
myself a fan of.

03:48.300 --> 03:52.620
Oh boy, if only I knew how bad things really were.

03:52.620 --> 04:07.620
Over the next five years, I slowly came to grips with the absolute horror I was witnessing

04:07.620 --> 04:09.820
unfold in front of me.

04:09.820 --> 04:15.740
Not only were my greatest fears being realized, but it was worse than I ever could have imagined.

04:15.740 --> 04:20.620
Somehow, despite their unfathomable wealth and resources, Disney managed to fumble the

04:20.620 --> 04:25.180
bag on the most beloved IP in their entire company portfolio.

04:25.180 --> 04:28.360
At first, I didn't want to believe it was happening.

04:28.360 --> 04:32.560
After film two of the trilogy, things were looking grim.

04:32.560 --> 04:37.280
But Star Wars teaches us to cling onto hope in these very situations.

04:37.280 --> 04:41.160
So I did, for as long as I possibly could.

04:41.160 --> 04:46.920
Then one dreary December day in 2019, I walked into some godforsaken theater in Jacksonville

04:46.920 --> 04:53.480
to witness the defining franchise of my childhood meet its bitter and unforgivable end.

04:53.480 --> 04:56.680
Some people actually liked this movie.

04:56.680 --> 04:58.040
That's good for them.

04:58.040 --> 04:59.400
I didn't.

04:59.400 --> 05:04.640
In fact, I can confidently say that no other film for as long as I live will possibly make

05:04.640 --> 05:10.040
me feel the level of shame, betrayal, and hostility as I did in that moment.

05:10.040 --> 05:14.320
I believe it was during the scene where the heroes are fighting the heavily armed space

05:14.320 --> 05:19.080
fleet on horseback when I really started rethinking my life choices.

05:19.080 --> 05:21.240
Star Wars, as I knew it, was dead.

05:21.240 --> 05:26.840
It was something I had suspected all along, and by now, there was no more childhood naivete

05:26.840 --> 05:28.560
to cushion the blow.

05:28.560 --> 05:33.680
It dawned on me that all those years I had spent as a diehard fan had meant absolutely

05:33.680 --> 05:34.680
nothing.

05:34.680 --> 05:38.920
I felt like such a fool for convincing myself that there would be any sort of payoff for

05:38.920 --> 05:42.400
the emotional investment I poured into this franchise.

05:42.400 --> 05:46.920
I no longer cared about the story, the characters, anything.

05:46.920 --> 05:52.000
All of a sudden, I wanted nothing to do with the series I loved for my entire life.

05:52.000 --> 05:54.640
This movie made me hate Star Wars.

05:54.640 --> 05:58.840
It made me question why I even watched movies in the first place.

05:58.840 --> 06:05.320
After that dark day, my first love in cinema had been totally and unequivocally ruined.

06:05.320 --> 06:08.080
But luckily for me, there was another.

07:06.320 --> 07:09.040
Uh, I don't think you should be investing in companies like-

07:09.040 --> 07:11.040
Hey, you like the Spoke Post?

07:11.040 --> 07:12.040
Yeah, of course.

07:12.040 --> 07:15.320
They sent me this great camping chair, the parked box.

07:15.320 --> 07:20.840
It's great for when you're camping out to be the first in line to one of the greatest

07:20.840 --> 07:22.720
movie sensations of the year.

07:22.720 --> 07:28.800
Of course, what good is camping out for the movie without some nice, delicious movie theater

07:28.800 --> 07:29.800
popcorn?

07:30.800 --> 07:36.280
Of course, I have a concealed in the middle of the Spoke Post Weekender Travel Bag.

07:36.280 --> 07:40.960
Why go through the trouble of sneaking in popcorn if you don't also have your nice little

07:40.960 --> 07:42.560
container of soda?

07:42.560 --> 07:48.480
And with Bespoke's Cask Box, you too can have delicious popcorn refreshment and refreshing

07:48.480 --> 07:52.440
soda to watch your favorite movie event of the year.

07:52.440 --> 07:57.320
And these amazing products and more could be yours by visiting Bespoke Post's Web Zone

07:57.320 --> 07:59.360

08:05.120 --> 08:07.400

And if you're a fan of coming attractions, Bespoke lets you preview your box.

08:11.440 --> 08:15.880
And if you don't like what you see, you can swap it out or skip the month entirely at

08:15.880 --> 08:16.880
no charge.

08:16.880 --> 08:21.280
I don't know, it seems kind of unethical to sneak your snacks into the theater.

08:21.280 --> 08:26.320
I mean, if everyone started doing that, it might cause them to start going out of business.

08:27.320 --> 08:32.480
Well, you know, Rough G, after a while, the prices in there, they're just not a good

08:32.480 --> 08:34.200
value anymore.

08:34.200 --> 08:37.680
But where you will find a good value is with Bespoke Post.

08:37.680 --> 08:42.760
Each box contains over $70 worth of stuff, and you get it for only a fraction of the

08:42.760 --> 08:43.760
cost.

08:43.760 --> 08:48.240
I'm not gonna lie, man, it doesn't look like anyone works here anymore.

08:48.240 --> 08:50.800
Don't you think you should go back and start working on your videos?

08:50.800 --> 08:54.960
Can you stop asking completely reasonable questions?

08:55.600 --> 08:57.600
Don't ask questions, just consume product.

08:57.600 --> 09:04.800
And you can consume the product at BespokePost.com slash EmpLemon20 for 20% off your first box.

09:04.800 --> 09:08.720
Man, they sure do seem to be taking a while.

09:08.720 --> 09:11.080
I wonder what's the holdup?

09:11.080 --> 09:13.960
You think it has something to do with the quality of the movie industry?

09:13.960 --> 09:14.960
I don't know what you mean by that.

09:14.960 --> 09:17.640
There's been tons of great hits in the past few years.

09:17.640 --> 09:20.640
Titanic, Jurassic Park, Die Hard.

09:20.640 --> 09:23.200
Seems like the industry's doing better than it's ever been.

09:23.240 --> 09:24.960
Emp, you're not making any sense.

09:24.960 --> 09:25.960
What are you talking about?

09:25.960 --> 09:28.400
Have you been living under a rock?

09:28.400 --> 09:34.960
It's the biggest movie in history, the follow-up to the most beloved trilogy of all time.

09:34.960 --> 09:35.960
Hello?

09:35.960 --> 09:36.960
Hello?

09:36.960 --> 09:39.320
I don't understand.

09:39.320 --> 09:41.120
The premiere's just in a couple days.

09:41.120 --> 09:42.120
Why is nobody here?

09:42.120 --> 09:43.440
Why is nobody waiting?

09:43.440 --> 09:45.940
Emp, you have to relax, all right?

09:45.940 --> 09:47.160
You're acting erratic.

09:47.160 --> 09:49.280
Everything you're saying makes no sense.

09:49.280 --> 09:51.560
Titanic, Die Hard, Jurassic Park.

09:51.560 --> 09:55.640
Those movies haven't been popular for over 20 years.

09:55.640 --> 09:57.040
What did you just say?

09:57.040 --> 10:03.280
Yeah, those movies have not been popular for over 20 years.

10:03.280 --> 10:06.480
You can't be serious.

10:06.480 --> 10:17.360
Rusty, what year is it?

10:17.360 --> 10:23.000
Star Wars Downward Spiral can be traced all the way back to the May of 1999 and the release

10:23.000 --> 10:28.920
of The Phantom Menace, which many fans attribute as the kiss of death for the brand.

10:28.920 --> 10:33.880
Just a few weeks prior, a different sci-fi franchise had sprung to life.

10:33.880 --> 10:38.840
It is the world that has been pulled over your eyes to blind you from the truth.

10:38.840 --> 10:42.520
The Matrix made itself known as the surprise of the year.

10:42.520 --> 10:46.920
It burst out of the gates, setting the box office record for an April release.

10:46.920 --> 10:52.000
For a film that was only sparingly marketed, its meteoric success had seemingly come out

10:52.000 --> 10:53.440
of nowhere.

10:53.440 --> 10:57.300
Lead actor Keanu Reeves was mostly unknown at the time.

10:57.300 --> 11:01.880
Even less known were the film's enigmatic directors, the Wachowskis.

11:01.880 --> 11:06.020
Whoever they were, they'd captured lightning in a bottle.

11:06.020 --> 11:09.720
Audiences were being drawn in by nothing more than pure intrigue.

11:09.720 --> 11:13.300
The Matrix packed the theaters for one simple reason.

11:13.300 --> 11:15.900
No one had ever seen anything like it.

11:15.900 --> 11:18.900
It was ambitious, innovative, and salient.

11:18.900 --> 11:23.340
It pioneered such revolutionary techniques in filmmaking that its influence is still

11:23.340 --> 11:24.980
felt today.

11:24.980 --> 11:30.220
But what truly set The Matrix apart from the competition was its philosophical depth.

11:30.220 --> 11:36.260
For many, it represented the ultimate exploration of one of modern man's deepest fears.

11:36.260 --> 11:40.340
The year 1999 seems to come up a lot in my videos.

11:40.340 --> 11:45.100
I have come to view it as this inflection point in the trajectory of modern society,

11:45.100 --> 11:49.780
after which everything seems to have taken an ominous turn for the worse.

11:49.780 --> 11:52.720
Turns out the future ain't quite what it's cracked up to be.

11:52.720 --> 11:57.640
And while dystopian visions of tomorrow were nothing new, the one presented by The Matrix

11:57.640 --> 12:00.520
is exceptionally bleak.

12:00.520 --> 12:03.900
Human beings have forever been defined by technology.

12:03.900 --> 12:08.940
Our ability to transform natural elements into complex tools is what separates us from

12:08.940 --> 12:11.160
the rest of the animal kingdom.

12:11.160 --> 12:16.440
But somewhere along the way, tools became a little too complex, and we started calling

12:16.440 --> 12:19.520
them something else—machines.

12:19.520 --> 12:24.280
While it's difficult to pinpoint exactly when this shift occurred, it seemed to coincide

12:24.280 --> 12:28.540
with a time when technology started to feel intimidating.

12:28.540 --> 12:33.560
This sentiment became apparent at the start of the Industrial Revolution, when machines

12:33.560 --> 12:35.800
began replacing us.

12:35.800 --> 12:40.800
Perhaps the first conflict between man and machine can be traced back to an 18th century

12:40.800 --> 12:46.680
weaver named Ned Ludd, who, according to legend, smashed a pair of knitting racks in a fit

12:46.680 --> 12:47.680
of rage.

12:47.680 --> 12:54.000
By the 19th century, technology had begun to transform the entire textile industry.

12:54.000 --> 12:58.600
Skilled artisans were now being undercut by automated factories which could output similar

12:58.600 --> 13:01.200
goods at a much lower expense.

13:01.200 --> 13:07.080
In 1811, the disenfranchised started lashing out against their mechanical oppressors.

13:07.080 --> 13:14.000
Taking after the story of Ned Ludd, this anti-technology faction would soon become known as the Luddites.

13:14.000 --> 13:19.480
The movement wouldn't last long, as the military soon cracked down on the insubordination.

13:19.480 --> 13:24.360
In time, the cultural consensus would go on to look back on the Luddites derisively,

13:24.360 --> 13:29.200
viewing them as an irrational hindrance to the natural pursuit of progress.

13:29.200 --> 13:32.840
After all, automation ends up benefiting everyone else.

13:32.840 --> 13:37.640
If someone ends up losing their job because of it, they're just taking one for the team.

13:37.640 --> 13:42.200
It was easy for all sorts of people to think this way, until all of a sudden, they were

13:42.200 --> 13:44.960
the ones getting replaced.

13:44.960 --> 13:50.820
As technology continued to rapidly advance, concerns over automation began to appear in

13:50.820 --> 13:52.120
fiction.

13:52.120 --> 13:56.920
The American folktale of John Henry was notably one of the first of its kind to feature a

13:56.920 --> 13:59.320
machine as an antagonist.

13:59.320 --> 14:04.440
The legend tells the story of a railroad worker who drops dead after racing a steam-powered

14:04.440 --> 14:05.740
drill.

14:05.740 --> 14:10.200
Later depictions of a machine-powered future would only get more grim.

14:10.200 --> 14:16.560
The 1927 film Metropolis presented the first depiction of a post-industrial dystopia.

14:16.560 --> 14:21.600
It laid the groundwork for what would eventually become known as the cyberpunk genre, a new

14:21.600 --> 14:27.400
wave in science fiction which expressed hesitancy to the rapid expansion of technology.

14:27.400 --> 14:33.640
It envisioned a future in which the pervasiveness of machines would oppress and suffocate mankind.

14:33.640 --> 14:39.360
While concerns of technology primarily focused on its omnipresence, others foresaw an additional

14:39.360 --> 14:41.660
threat in its intelligence.

14:41.660 --> 14:46.720
In the midst of its bionic world, Metropolis featured one of the first concepts of a bionic

14:46.720 --> 14:50.400
man, which we now refer to as robots.

14:50.400 --> 14:54.720
They represented an acknowledgement that somewhere ahead on the horizon, machines could

14:54.720 --> 14:59.280
eventually match and even surpass the capacities of human beings.

14:59.280 --> 15:03.840
In the 20th century, much of the pioneering literature about robots would be explored

15:03.840 --> 15:06.600
by sci-fi author Isaac Asimov.

15:06.600 --> 15:11.480
He is perhaps best known for coining the three laws of robotics, which sought to address

15:11.480 --> 15:16.760
the most immediate threat that life-sized automatons may evoke, the prospect of them

15:16.760 --> 15:18.640
turning on their masters.

15:18.880 --> 15:23.800
Asimov's work was compelling, especially during a time period which gave rise to the

15:23.800 --> 15:26.160
very first computers.

15:26.160 --> 15:31.560
All of a sudden, the idea of intelligent machines was spilling into reality, although at this

15:31.560 --> 15:35.120
point, it hardly resembled anything human.

15:35.120 --> 15:41.040
The original computers were almost Lovecraftian, an incomprehensible wall of electronic components

15:41.040 --> 15:46.860
that, by some terrifying miracle, were capable of mimicking the foundational elements of

15:46.860 --> 15:47.860
thought.

15:48.100 --> 15:53.780
Contrary to their initial humanoid depictions, computers were practically formless.

15:53.780 --> 15:58.180
They could theoretically take on the appearance of anything we could imagine.

15:58.180 --> 16:03.140
The film 2001 A Space Odyssey would introduce the first landmark appearance of artificial

16:03.140 --> 16:05.220
intelligence in cinema.

16:05.220 --> 16:11.340
The cold and calculating HAL 9000 would unnerve audiences for decades to come.

16:11.340 --> 16:16.340
Director Stanley Kubrick reimagined the machine antagonist as more than a single threatening

16:16.340 --> 16:17.340
entity.

16:17.340 --> 16:21.900
Rather, one which served as a hostile extension of the setting itself.

16:21.900 --> 16:25.340
This idea would be expanded on further by the artist H.R.

16:25.340 --> 16:31.140
Geiger, who produced nightmarish illustrations of living things being smothered by an all-encompassing

16:31.140 --> 16:33.440
mechanical environment.

16:33.440 --> 16:38.740
In 1973, he would create one of his most notable works while collaborating with the progressive

16:38.740 --> 16:41.260
rock band Emerson Lake & Palmer.

16:41.260 --> 16:46.700
The group was finishing their new album Brain Salad Surgery, which depicts an epic war between

16:46.700 --> 16:48.800
humans and computers.

16:48.800 --> 16:54.180
While listening through, Geiger composed what would eventually become the album's artwork.

16:54.180 --> 17:01.060
An outer cover featuring a sterile metal sarcophagus, which opens to reveal a lobotomized woman.

17:01.060 --> 17:06.100
While Geiger envisioned a physical convergence between man and machine, sci-fi author Philip

17:06.100 --> 17:09.020
K. Dick took a more conceptual approach.

17:09.020 --> 17:14.460
His 1968 novel Due Android's Dream of Electric Sheep features human-like replicants who are

17:14.460 --> 17:18.220
practically indistinguishable from biological men.

17:18.220 --> 17:23.400
This premise would later be adapted into the 1982 film Blade Runner, where the corruptive

17:23.400 --> 17:29.280
influence of technology has expanded to threaten our perception of reality itself.

17:29.280 --> 17:34.620
By this time, computers were being welcomed into people's homes, and the advent of a virtual

17:34.620 --> 17:38.740
reality was no longer a question of if, but when.

17:38.740 --> 17:43.760
The rapid acceleration of computing power began to fuel theories of a potential technological

17:43.760 --> 17:49.880
singularity on the horizon, in which super-intelligent machines could achieve god-like abilities,

17:49.880 --> 17:52.960
thus rendering all of mankind obsolete.

17:52.960 --> 17:57.840
At the same time, fictional works began to push the concept of machine warfare to its

17:57.840 --> 17:59.620
absolute limit.

17:59.620 --> 18:05.780
If a confrontation between humans and machines did arise, just how bad could things get?

18:05.780 --> 18:10.480
The Terminator franchise envisioned the human race being driven to the brink of extinction

18:10.480 --> 18:16.620
by nuclear hellfire, a somber outcome indeed, but one which many would find preferable to

18:16.620 --> 18:19.800
the scenario depicted by The Matrix.

18:19.800 --> 18:25.180
In a world where mankind has long since lost its war against the machines, human beings

18:25.180 --> 18:31.480
have been forced into a fate worse than death, a state of total submission in which our homeostatic

18:31.480 --> 18:35.280
energy is harvested to power the machine world.

18:35.280 --> 18:41.100
The collective human consciousness is imprisoned and pacified by a lifelike simulation.

18:41.100 --> 18:46.200
This premise is very much reminiscent of Plato's allegory of the cave, an age-old metaphor

18:46.200 --> 18:49.280
about the nature of truth and objectivity.

18:49.280 --> 18:54.080
It seeks to highlight philosophical enlightenment as the pathway to salvation.

18:54.080 --> 18:58.600
But of course, that's to assume that whatever's waiting for us outside the cave is actually

18:58.600 --> 19:00.120
worth the journey.

19:00.120 --> 19:04.820
Coincidentally, one year before the debut of The Matrix, an entirely different film

19:04.860 --> 19:09.260
had already explored the premise of escaping from a false reality.

19:09.260 --> 19:13.860
And while we never see what happens to Truman after he breaks free of the simulation, it's

19:13.860 --> 19:17.020
implied that he's gone to a better place.

19:17.020 --> 19:20.600
In The Matrix, however, the decision is not as clear.

19:20.600 --> 19:25.440
It's human nature to seek out truth, but does there come a point when the truth is so ugly

19:25.440 --> 19:28.160
that we'd be better off not knowing at all?

19:28.160 --> 19:33.480
How many of us would choose to remain in the cave if we knew the horrors that lay beyond it?

19:33.520 --> 19:37.840
Perhaps it would be better for us to simply stay put and play it safe.

19:37.840 --> 19:41.000
But the story of humanity would indicate otherwise.

19:41.000 --> 19:46.540
It goes against human nature to remain imprisoned in both a cave and a simulation, for the simple

19:46.540 --> 19:49.340
reason that it undermines our autonomy.

19:49.340 --> 19:54.920
For just as technology defines mankind, so too does self-determination.

19:54.920 --> 19:59.720
The idea that we are the masters of our own destiny, that our decisions are the product

19:59.720 --> 20:03.840
of free will, and not some pre-programmed directive.

20:03.840 --> 20:07.940
In this way, we are distinct from both animals and machines.

20:07.940 --> 20:13.340
Human beings aren't required to behave in ways that are entirely instinctual nor logical.

20:13.340 --> 20:18.460
While computers may one day reach a level of intellect magnitudes higher than our own,

20:18.460 --> 20:22.960
it's unclear whether they will ever be able to truly think like us.

20:22.960 --> 20:28.520
Choice is unmistakably human, even if those choices often aren't the most rational.

20:28.520 --> 20:32.560
It's for this reason why Neo is such an engaging protagonist.

20:32.560 --> 20:37.440
His journey relies on regaining the right to choose, no matter the monumentality of

20:37.440 --> 20:39.640
the system standing in his way.

20:39.640 --> 20:44.980
Audiences couldn't help but relate to Neo's story, especially during a time when so many

20:44.980 --> 20:48.280
of us were losing our autonomy.

20:48.280 --> 20:53.120
The 20th century was marked by the rise and fall of totalitarian regimes.

20:53.120 --> 20:57.380
The collapse of the Soviet Union was supposed to signal the dawning of a new era in which

20:57.380 --> 21:01.900
the people of the world could finally exist as liberated citizens.

21:01.900 --> 21:07.460
The 90s were generally regarded as a time of idealistic optimism for the future, a sentiment

21:07.460 --> 21:12.820
which was nonetheless undercut by the ominous feeling that something was not quite right,

21:12.820 --> 21:18.220
that the so-called free society we were inhabiting didn't exactly come as advertised.

21:18.220 --> 21:22.840
There's a scene in The Matrix where Agent Smith explains why the machines chose to simulate

21:22.840 --> 21:24.980
the year 1999.

21:24.980 --> 21:28.260
He describes it as the peak of civilization.

21:28.260 --> 21:32.900
Obviously the setting was intended to match the contemporary release of the film, but

21:32.900 --> 21:38.300
it's eerie to look back on that line today and realize just how true it still rings.

21:38.300 --> 21:44.140
While the machines canonically intended to pass off the year 1999 as a convincing reality,

21:44.140 --> 21:48.500
it ironically marked a point when everything started to feel artificial.

21:48.500 --> 21:54.600
The late 20th century saw the rise of a different kind of machine, the corporate machine, financial

21:54.600 --> 21:59.720
behemoths whose influence grew to rival the most dominant empires in history.

21:59.720 --> 22:05.080
These man-made entities have very much become the monolithic overlords of the present day,

22:05.080 --> 22:08.520
and they've been actively twisting the reality around us.

22:08.520 --> 22:14.240
It was hard to notice at first, everything seemed so normal, but eventually the anomalies

22:14.240 --> 22:17.160
just became too much to ignore.

22:17.160 --> 22:22.160
Despite all the concerns of machines acting like us, no one could anticipate just how

22:22.160 --> 22:25.480
much we would start acting like machines.

22:25.480 --> 22:30.040
It's strange to consider how one of the original worries about automation had to do with it

22:30.040 --> 22:32.560
providing us too much leisure.

22:32.560 --> 22:36.360
If that was ever the case, we surely haven't seen any of it.

22:36.360 --> 22:40.400
In fact, there's an argument to be made that the average person today is doing more

22:40.400 --> 22:43.600
work than at any other time in recent history.

22:43.600 --> 22:49.480
Simultaneously, the nature of that work has only become more robotic and dehumanizing.

22:49.480 --> 22:54.760
The ruthless efficiency of the labor market has rendered individuality almost worthless.

22:54.760 --> 22:58.280
You either fit in to the preordained system or you don't.

22:58.280 --> 23:00.880
Either way, you're just another cog.

23:00.880 --> 23:05.040
The fruits of your labor serve no greater philosophical purpose.

23:05.040 --> 23:09.800
You can't help but get a little existential when it feels like everything you do is meaningless.

23:09.800 --> 23:14.480
It's a feeling that now extends far beyond the office cubicle.

23:14.480 --> 23:19.600
The relentless thirst for profit has expanded to pervade nearly all walks of life.

23:19.600 --> 23:24.480
Much like the fate of humans in the Matrix, modern consumers are created and harvested

23:24.480 --> 23:28.880
to feed some inescapable system that we will never comprehend.

23:28.880 --> 23:33.000
And although we've found ourselves with no shortage of things to buy, it's somewhat

23:33.000 --> 23:37.860
shocking just how limited our options have become pretty much everywhere else.

23:37.860 --> 23:42.400
If you've ever wanted to experience how it feels to be in the Matrix, look no further

23:42.400 --> 24:11.880
than the very industry from which it came.

24:11.880 --> 24:15.960
It seems like these days, everything has to be a franchise.

24:15.960 --> 24:20.900
Because while a standalone film is limited to its moment in the sun, a cinematic universe

24:20.900 --> 24:23.900
can be milked until the sun stops shining.

24:23.900 --> 24:29.220
Why allow something to die when you can keep it in a perpetual state of suspended animation,

24:29.220 --> 24:33.720
siphoning off every last drop of whatever made it so alive in the first place?

24:33.720 --> 24:38.300
The Matrix, of course, had its share of sequels, which never quite reached the acclaim of the

24:38.300 --> 24:39.300
original.

24:39.460 --> 24:44.180
While they have been criticized for being a tad too cryptic and incoherent at times,

24:44.180 --> 24:48.200
there was never any doubt over whether they deserved to be made at all.

24:48.200 --> 24:52.720
Each of them represented a clear artistic vision and continued the story in a meaningful

24:52.720 --> 24:53.720
way.

24:53.720 --> 24:58.120
They served a purpose beyond being a shameless cash grab.

24:58.120 --> 25:04.600
2019 marked 20 years since the release of The Matrix, and much had changed since then.

25:04.600 --> 25:08.880
Keanu Reeves moved on to an entirely new action franchise.

25:08.880 --> 25:14.300
The Wachowski brothers were now the Wachowski sisters, and the film industry had mutated

25:14.300 --> 25:17.380
into an almost unrecognizable wasteland.

25:17.380 --> 25:22.940
Gone were the days of the ambitious auteurs who defined Hollywood's greatest hits.

25:22.940 --> 25:27.420
Modern blockbusters now view ambition as an unnecessary risk.

25:27.420 --> 25:32.700
Turns out that film studios had become 20 years smarter at making movies profitable.

25:32.700 --> 25:37.040
The first Matrix film wound up making Warner Bros nearly half a billion dollars at the

25:37.040 --> 25:41.600
box office, which was almost eight times their initial investment.

25:41.600 --> 25:45.900
This remarkable financial success makes it all the more baffling to consider that had

25:45.900 --> 25:49.700
it been pitched today, The Matrix would have probably never been made.

25:49.700 --> 25:54.740
I mean, if you really think about it, when was the last time any major Hollywood studio

25:54.740 --> 25:57.580
rolled the dice on an unproven concept?

25:57.580 --> 26:03.060
Could an R-rated blockbuster with such esoteric themes even exist nowadays?

26:03.080 --> 26:08.340
This used to be some place you'd go to witness something truly spectacular, but lately, every

26:08.340 --> 26:12.880
aspect of the industry has been on a steady march towards mediocrity.

26:12.880 --> 26:18.540
Twitter user Eric Krebs helped visualize the stark decline of originality in Hollywood.

26:18.540 --> 26:23.840
It's now common for the top ten grossing films of the year to be entirely composed of recycled

26:23.840 --> 26:26.860
concepts from pre-existing source material.

26:26.860 --> 26:32.000
The superhero genre alone, which The Matrix ironically helped inspire, has ballooned to

26:32.020 --> 26:35.460
fill up nearly half of all Blockbuster's release.

26:35.460 --> 26:41.500
The number of R-rated films has been gutted to make way for the far more marketable PG-13,

26:41.500 --> 26:47.160
a format which neuters the filmmaker's ability to explore sophisticated ideas.

26:47.160 --> 26:52.580
The once promising field of computer graphics now comes off far more as a crutch for overworked

26:52.580 --> 26:56.780
productions who can't be bothered to compose an actual scene.

26:56.780 --> 27:02.280
The Hollywood simulation is now almost entirely dependent on machines, and the results are

27:02.280 --> 27:05.480
just as uninspiring as you may have guessed.

27:05.480 --> 27:10.220
It seems like every big-budget film today, no matter who directed it or which studio

27:10.220 --> 27:15.920
backed it, now looks like the same bland and homogenous visual sludge.

27:15.920 --> 27:20.520
There is a disturbing lack of humanity in modern-day blockbusters.

27:20.520 --> 27:25.200
Creative control has been wrestled away from filmmakers and placed in the hands of bureaucratic

27:25.260 --> 27:31.260
committees who audit every decision in the production process over its financial sensibility.

27:31.260 --> 27:36.080
Anything remotely nuanced or edgy is generally not advisable.

27:36.080 --> 27:40.940
Movies are now expected to be international events and should in no way touch on any issues

27:40.940 --> 27:45.100
that may marginally offend anyone on the opposite side of the globe.

27:45.100 --> 27:50.260
For an industry once renowned for its limitless possibilities, it's disheartening to see

27:50.260 --> 27:54.420
so much of cinema now defined by what you can't do.

27:54.420 --> 27:58.720
The craft of filmmaking has been streamlined from an art to a science.

27:58.720 --> 28:03.540
Major releases no longer feel like an organic exercise in creativity.

28:03.540 --> 28:07.380
They feel like the product of a heavily controlled formula.

28:07.380 --> 28:12.440
Much like a rollercoaster, they're designed to offer the impression of a dire situation,

28:12.440 --> 28:15.840
while all along you were never in any real danger.

28:15.840 --> 28:20.260
After it's all said and done, you always wind up right back where you started.

28:20.260 --> 28:22.480
You haven't really gone anywhere.

28:22.480 --> 28:24.760
Why allow the heroes to fail?

28:24.760 --> 28:28.020
Why allow a fan favorite character to truly die?

28:28.020 --> 28:31.420
Why allow the guy to not get the girl in the end?

28:31.420 --> 28:36.260
Sure, doing so might produce a moment that's actually meaningful, but that would imply

28:36.260 --> 28:40.760
that movies can tell a story that's even remotely complex.

28:40.760 --> 28:46.560
It's as if Hollywood is no longer capable of producing stories which are actually satisfying.

28:46.560 --> 28:51.340
They instead come off as a disparate patchwork of amusement with very little substance or

28:51.340 --> 28:54.240
cohesion holding anything together.

28:54.240 --> 28:58.160
It's like going to a restaurant expecting a gourmet meal and getting served a plate

28:58.160 --> 28:59.160
of candy.

28:59.160 --> 29:04.200
Sure, it sets off all the right receptors, but rather than making you feel full, it just

29:04.200 --> 29:05.780
makes you sick.

29:05.780 --> 29:11.000
And the sickening sweetness of movies today is delivered through meaningless nostalgia,

29:11.000 --> 29:17.440
assaulting the audience with a nauseating barrage of familiar faces, places, and sounds.

29:17.440 --> 29:22.200
Movies now go so far as to resurrect the dead just to keep the same old song and dance

29:22.200 --> 29:27.360
going, as part of some desperate ploy to remind us of a time when movies actually made us

29:27.360 --> 29:29.140
feel something.

29:29.140 --> 29:31.360
Some of us aren't fooled, however.

29:31.360 --> 29:37.440
We know that we're not living in 1999 anymore and recognize the product on screen as a hollow

29:37.440 --> 29:41.880
imitation, only resembling the original superficially.

29:41.880 --> 29:48.120
Just like a machine, it has no soul, and it replaced whatever was alive long ago.

29:48.120 --> 29:50.680
Such is the fate of the modern franchise.

29:50.680 --> 29:57.420
It happened to Star Wars, and soon enough, it would happen with The Matrix 2.

29:57.420 --> 30:02.580
These days it seems like no entertainment property is safe from the dreaded reboot.

30:02.580 --> 30:07.600
As the pool of original ideas has dried up, Hollywood has determined that it's now far

30:07.600 --> 30:12.980
more cost-effective to simply regurgitate existing brands from a bygone era.

30:12.980 --> 30:18.000
While the uninitiated may feel excited to reunite with that special friend, it's important

30:18.000 --> 30:22.120
to realize what exactly made it so special in the first place.

30:22.120 --> 30:27.420
Surely it wasn't geriatric celebrities trying and failing to relive the glory days, nor

30:27.420 --> 30:32.980
was it a bubble-wrapped and sanitized retelling of a story we've already heard before.

30:32.980 --> 30:39.160
How about the nonsensical addition of a marketable character whose only purpose is to drive toy sales?

30:39.160 --> 30:43.860
If you ask me, the vast majority of rebooted franchises would have been far better off

30:43.860 --> 30:45.460
staying dead.

30:45.460 --> 30:48.700
They aren't interested in selling a quality product.

30:48.700 --> 30:50.700
All they're selling is a legacy.

30:50.700 --> 30:56.900
A legacy which stands to be actively tarnished by whatever vapid slop is being pumped out today.

30:56.900 --> 30:58.300
But what can I say?

30:58.300 --> 31:03.020
There's a reason why shameless pandering sequels continue to flood the market.

31:03.020 --> 31:05.020
People keep paying to see them.

31:05.020 --> 31:09.660
It's almost as if modern consumers have been conditioned to accept nothing more.

31:09.660 --> 31:12.820
To be content with middling disappointment.

31:12.820 --> 31:19.500
Reboots have become inevitable, and studios are now hungry to defile the graves of long-dead franchises.

31:19.500 --> 31:24.880
Naturally, it was only a matter of time before The Matrix was next on the chopping block.

31:24.880 --> 31:30.420
It was the end of 2019, right around the time Star Wars got sent to the glue factory,

31:30.420 --> 31:33.600
when news came out that The Matrix was next.

31:33.600 --> 31:37.680
Warner Bros. wanted a fourth installment to the series, and they were gonna make it with

31:37.680 --> 31:39.920
or without the Wachowskis.

31:39.920 --> 31:46.520
The thing is, there already was a fourth Matrix film, the excellent and often overlooked Animatrix,

31:46.520 --> 31:50.560
an anthology of short stories set in the Matrix universe.

31:50.560 --> 31:54.200
It was a supplemental release that truly deserved to be made.

31:54.200 --> 31:58.840
One curated by the Wachowskis to celebrate the spirit of the originals by opening it

31:58.840 --> 32:01.600
up to the interpretations of others.

32:01.600 --> 32:06.440
The stories within were imaginative, dynamic, and stylistically vibrant.

32:06.440 --> 32:12.180
A fitting send-off to a project which placed so much emphasis on free expression.

32:12.180 --> 32:14.720
If only it was that simple.

32:14.720 --> 32:19.800
Warner Bros. could sense that The Matrix brand still had quite a bit of money left in it.

32:19.800 --> 32:21.660
Everything else was getting rebooted.

32:21.660 --> 32:23.240
Why not The Matrix?

32:23.240 --> 32:27.360
It didn't matter that the story had already reached its logical conclusion.

32:27.360 --> 32:31.640
They had tickets to sell, as well as a sleek new streaming service.

32:31.640 --> 32:35.120
The studio basically gave the Wachowskis an ultimatum.

32:35.120 --> 32:40.020
They could either oversee the spiritual death of their brainchild, or hand the job over

32:40.020 --> 32:41.760
to someone else.

32:41.760 --> 32:46.600
Either way, the defining achievement of their lives would be turned into an abject mockery

32:46.600 --> 32:48.780
of everything it once stood for.

32:48.780 --> 32:52.920
Upon hearing the news, Lily Wachowski wanted nothing to do with it.

32:52.920 --> 32:59.600
So that just left Lana to figure out how to defeat The Matrix once and for all.

32:59.600 --> 33:03.660
So what do you do if you're being forced into a movie you don't want to make?

33:03.660 --> 33:08.500
Well, believe it or not, the wisdom of how to handle the fate of one of Hollywood's

33:08.500 --> 33:12.740
most acclaimed enterprises could be found in one of its least.

33:12.740 --> 33:18.460
And it was all made possible by, coincidentally, an unlikely hero named Tom.

33:18.460 --> 33:25.220
1999 would mark the big break for comedian Tom Green, who landed a new show on MTV.

33:25.220 --> 33:30.340
He soon established himself as a pioneer of shock humor and the socially uncomfortable,

33:30.340 --> 33:34.660
serving as the progenitor for some of the most popular comedy today.

33:34.660 --> 33:38.660
Tom was very much ahead of the curve, in more ways than one.

33:38.660 --> 33:43.740
Because in 2001, he would produce something so avant-garde that we have only just begun

33:43.740 --> 33:45.420
to appreciate it.

33:45.420 --> 33:48.660
What is the most disgusting film of 2001?

33:48.660 --> 33:53.340
The champion is Freddy Got Fingered with Tom Green making David Spade look like Jim Carrey

33:53.340 --> 33:56.220
and Jim Carrey look like Laurence Olivier.

33:56.220 --> 34:01.260
Accounts differ depending on who you ask, but legend has it, Tom was required to make

34:01.260 --> 34:05.740
a movie against his will due to some contractual dispute with the studio.

34:05.740 --> 34:11.340
20th Century Fox would end up getting their movie, but the comedian would have the last laugh.

34:11.340 --> 34:16.780
The result was Freddy Got Fingered, a film so diabolically awful that it all feels like

34:16.780 --> 34:18.740
one big practical joke.

34:18.740 --> 34:23.740
Perhaps no other movie out there expresses such contempt for the Hollywood system.

34:23.740 --> 34:27.660
It literally tells the story of an artist wasting the studio's money.

34:27.660 --> 34:29.500
There's a million dollars gone.

34:29.500 --> 34:31.420
Easy come, easy go.

34:31.420 --> 34:39.140
And while he's not exactly Neo, he is portrayed as a self-aware person trapped inside a contrived reality.

34:39.140 --> 34:43.740
At the time of its release, nobody really understood what the film was about.

34:43.740 --> 34:48.100
It went on to become one of the most critically panned movies of this century.

34:48.100 --> 34:53.220
Tom Green proudly accepted his five Razzie awards, reportedly having to be dragged off

34:53.220 --> 34:58.620
stage after breaking out a never-ending harmonica solo during its acceptance speech.

34:58.620 --> 35:00.780
It just didn't make any sense.

35:00.780 --> 35:03.220
Everyone dreams of being a movie star.

35:03.220 --> 35:07.100
To be given such an opportunity should be considered a great honor.

35:07.140 --> 35:12.900
Why would someone just throw it all away like that and turn the whole thing into a laughingstock?

35:12.900 --> 35:16.780
How could anyone willingly attach their name to something so embarrassing?

35:16.780 --> 35:21.140
Well, you have to remember that Tom Green was ahead of the curve.

35:21.140 --> 35:26.180
Maybe he knew what the film industry would become and saw the way out.

35:26.180 --> 35:30.940
Turns out the best way to defeat the Hollywood machine was giving the studio the finger.

35:30.940 --> 35:33.180
Hi, this is my painting that I made.

35:33.180 --> 35:34.820
It's called Tiger Zebra.

35:34.860 --> 35:37.940
I worked really, really hard on it, and now I'm going to go put it up in the National

35:37.940 --> 35:41.540
Art Gallery, because that's where all the really, really good paintings go, and I want

35:41.540 --> 35:45.740
mine to be seen by all the people that appreciate really, really good art like this.

35:49.580 --> 35:54.980
In December of 2021, I returned to another Jacksonville theater fully preparing to be

35:54.980 --> 35:57.900
debilitated by another hideous sequel.

35:57.900 --> 36:02.440
But what I ended up witnessing instead was unlike anything I could have expected.

36:02.440 --> 36:08.300
In many ways, what I saw that day was very much a terrible end to a beloved franchise.

36:08.300 --> 36:13.740
From a nonsensical and immersion-shattering plot to goofy, dumbed-down characters.

36:13.740 --> 36:19.840
A film stuffed to the brim with baffling moments like Neo watching the first Matrix on a projector,

36:19.840 --> 36:23.640
pouring a container of blue pills into his mouth, and a strawberry.

36:23.640 --> 36:25.660
A strawberry?

36:25.660 --> 36:30.960
At first glance, it looked to be yet another Rise of Skywalker, but something felt different

36:30.960 --> 36:31.960
this time around.

36:32.000 --> 36:36.760
Nothing comforts anxiety like a little nostalgia.

36:36.760 --> 36:42.760
The Matrix Resurrections was a film so aggressively idiotic that it seemed almost deliberate.

36:42.760 --> 36:47.260
As if the creators were attempting to weaponize their own stupidity.

36:47.260 --> 36:48.560
And then it hit me.

36:48.560 --> 36:51.120
This wasn't just a sequel to The Matrix.

36:51.120 --> 36:54.000
It was a sequel to Freddy Got Fingered.

36:54.000 --> 36:57.120
It was a movie about not wanting to make a movie.

36:57.120 --> 37:01.920
I'm sure you can understand why our beloved parent company, Warner Brothers, has decided

37:01.920 --> 37:04.280
to make a sequel to the trilogy.

37:04.280 --> 37:10.160
Only this time, instead of wasting a paltry 14 million of studio funding, The Matrix Resurrections

37:10.160 --> 37:13.560
managed to squander more than 10 times that.

37:13.560 --> 37:18.840
If the creators did choose to sabotage the film in that way, then it may very well be

37:18.840 --> 37:22.040
one of the most expensive jokes ever told.

37:22.040 --> 37:26.340
A Matrix reboot was always going to be an artistic failure.

37:26.340 --> 37:29.980
And as well make that failure an inside job.

37:33.860 --> 37:36.720
But perhaps you think I'm giving them too much credit.

37:36.720 --> 37:40.460
That it's just another mediocre piece of crap like all the rest.

37:40.460 --> 37:44.740
Maybe Lana Wachowski, like many directors, ran out of talent.

37:44.740 --> 37:48.340
And The Matrix Resurrections was a genuine attempt.

37:48.340 --> 37:52.460
As far as any of us are concerned, that's the official explanation.

37:52.460 --> 37:53.460
But I don't know.

37:53.460 --> 37:58.820
I'd like to believe that for once, a shameless Hollywood reboot actually meant something.

37:58.820 --> 38:02.660
That it was more than just another big fat waste of time.

38:02.660 --> 38:07.700
Make no mistake about it, what I saw that day was an undeniable train wreck.

38:07.700 --> 38:10.220
But it was somehow beautiful.

38:10.220 --> 38:13.460
Not for what it was, but for what it represented.

38:13.460 --> 38:18.140
Sitting there in the theater on that December afternoon, I felt oddly vindicated.

38:18.140 --> 38:23.060
Like all the grief I suffered from The Rise of Skywalker had suddenly lifted.

38:23.060 --> 38:27.740
At the end of the day, both Star Wars and The Matrix tell a similar story.

38:27.740 --> 38:32.760
They offer us tales of a great hero rebelling against oppressive machinery.

38:32.760 --> 38:38.140
And while Star Wars was eventually tempted to the dark side, The Matrix remained defiant

38:38.140 --> 38:40.120
until the very end.

38:40.120 --> 38:44.660
It may have met a bitter fate, but it was one which nonetheless remained under control

38:44.660 --> 38:46.160
of the artist.

38:46.160 --> 38:50.540
In this regard, it was honorable, even in defeat.

38:50.540 --> 38:55.000
When faced with the death of their legacy, the creators still had enough dignity to go

38:55.000 --> 38:56.920
down with the ship.

38:56.920 --> 38:59.340
They informed me they're gonna do it with or without us.

38:59.340 --> 39:02.080
And they made it clear they'll kill our contract if we don't cooperate.

39:02.080 --> 39:07.680
I know you said the story was over for you, but that's the thing about stories.

39:07.680 --> 39:09.480
They never really end, do they?

39:09.480 --> 39:14.160
We're still telling the same stories we've always told, just with different names, different

39:14.160 --> 39:16.260
faces.

39:16.260 --> 39:19.320
The sheeple aren't going anywhere.

39:19.320 --> 39:20.320
They like my world.

39:20.320 --> 39:22.740
They don't want freedom or empowerment.

39:22.740 --> 39:24.840
They want to be controlled.

39:24.840 --> 39:26.960
They crave the comfort of certainty.

39:26.960 --> 39:37.880
And that means you two back in your pods, unconscious and alone, just like them.

39:37.880 --> 39:42.480
The Matrix resurrections will go down in history as a commercial failure.

39:42.480 --> 39:48.760
With losses in excess of $30 million, it will forever be known as a box office bomb.

39:48.760 --> 39:53.840
After just a few weeks, the whole thing was almost completely forgotten, leaving behind

39:53.840 --> 39:57.600
virtually no cultural impact whatsoever.

39:57.600 --> 40:03.240
Looking back now, just over a year later, it's almost like it never even existed.

40:03.240 --> 40:04.980
And maybe that's for the best.

40:04.980 --> 40:07.940
I'd call it a worthy sacrifice.

40:07.940 --> 40:12.320
Following the discouraging reception, Warner Bros. announced that they had no plans to

40:12.320 --> 40:15.060
continue the Matrix franchise.

40:15.060 --> 40:19.900
For the time being, it's at least one set of films that may finally be allowed to rest

40:19.900 --> 40:20.900
in peace.

40:20.900 --> 40:25.460
Hopefully, this whole situation can serve as a valuable lesson to the film industry

40:25.460 --> 40:28.400
that some things are better left in the past.

40:28.400 --> 40:29.500
And who knows?

40:29.500 --> 40:34.560
There may come a day when original ideas once again reign supreme in Hollywood.

40:34.560 --> 40:38.980
But until that happens, the whole system will be in desperate need of a de-boot.
