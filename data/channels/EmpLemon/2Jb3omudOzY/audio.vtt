00:00.000 --> 00:02.000
Well, I'll start off by saying this.

00:02.000 --> 00:03.700
Hey, what's my feed in the mail?

00:03.700 --> 00:05.700
I mailed it on you, saying this, yep.

00:06.500 --> 00:07.200
What does that mean?

00:07.200 --> 00:16.700
I don't care who you play, whether it's a high school team, a junior college, a junior college team, a high college team, much less a game college team.

00:16.700 --> 00:28.200
When you turn the ball over, nine thousand times, four interceptions, one per interception, one per game college team, one per Bill O'Reilly, one per five dick.

00:28.200 --> 00:30.200
In my opinion, that sucked.

00:30.700 --> 00:32.700
Fucking thing sucks!

00:33.200 --> 00:39.200
Well, I'll start off by saying this. Do not blame that game on the game defense. Blame that game on Bill O'Reilly.

00:39.700 --> 00:40.200
Fuck you.

00:40.700 --> 00:41.700
What's that?

00:41.700 --> 00:43.200
Cocksucker.

00:46.700 --> 00:47.200
What does that mean?

00:47.200 --> 00:48.200
Playoffs.

00:48.200 --> 00:50.200
Playoffs? Don't talk about it.

00:50.200 --> 00:52.200
Playoffs? You kidding me?

00:52.200 --> 00:53.200
Playoffs?

00:53.200 --> 00:54.200
Playoffs.

00:54.200 --> 00:55.200
Playoffs? Don't talk about it.

00:55.200 --> 00:56.200
Playoffs? You kidding me?

00:56.200 --> 00:57.200
Playoffs?

00:58.200 --> 00:59.200
Do it live!

00:59.200 --> 01:00.200
What what what?

01:00.500 --> 01:01.580
Do it live!

01:01.580 --> 01:02.200
What what what?

01:02.200 --> 01:03.200
What does that mean?

01:03.200 --> 01:04.200
What what what?

01:04.200 --> 01:05.200
What does that mean?

01:05.200 --> 01:06.200
What what what?

01:06.200 --> 01:07.200
Do it live!

01:07.200 --> 01:08.200
Playoffs.

01:08.200 --> 01:09.200
Do it live!

01:09.200 --> 01:10.200
Don't talk about it.

01:10.200 --> 01:11.200
expandable

01:11.200 --> 01:12.200
You kidding me?

01:12.200 --> 01:13.200
What what what?

01:13.200 --> 01:14.200
Playoffs?

01:14.200 --> 01:15.200
I just hope we can win a game.

01:15.200 --> 01:16.200
What does that mean?

01:16.200 --> 01:18.200
I don't know what that is.

01:18.200 --> 01:19.200
Step.

01:19.200 --> 01:20.200
What does that mean?

01:20.200 --> 01:21.200
I don't know what that means.

01:21.200 --> 01:23.200
What does that mean?

01:24.200 --> 01:25.200
Fuck you?

01:26.200 --> 01:27.200
Fuck you?

01:27.200 --> 01:29.200
I've just killed O'Reilly.

01:29.200 --> 01:30.200
DIE!
