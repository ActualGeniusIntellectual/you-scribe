Hey, what's my feed in the mail?
I mailed it on you, saying this, yep.
What does that mean?
I don't care who you play, whether it's a high school team, a junior college, a junior college team, a high college team, much less a game college team.
When you turn the ball over, nine thousand times, four interceptions, one per interception, one per game college team, one per Bill O'Reilly, one per five dick.
In my opinion, that sucked.
Fucking thing sucks!
Well, I'll start off by saying this. Do not blame that game on the game defense. Blame that game on Bill O'Reilly.
Fuck you.
What's that?
Cocksucker.
What does that mean?

I just hope we can win a game.

I don't know what that is.
