1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Well, I'll start off by saying this.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:03,700
Hey, what's my feed in the mail?

3
00:00:03,700 --> 00:00:05,700
I mailed it on you, saying this, yep.

4
00:00:06,500 --> 00:00:07,200
What does that mean?

5
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:16,700
I don't care who you play, whether it's a high school team, a junior college, a junior college team, a high college team, much less a game college team.

6
00:00:16,700 --> 00:00:28,200
When you turn the ball over, nine thousand times, four interceptions, one per interception, one per game college team, one per Bill O'Reilly, one per five dick.

7
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:30,200
In my opinion, that sucked.

8
00:00:30,700 --> 00:00:32,700
Fucking thing sucks!

9
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:39,200
Well, I'll start off by saying this. Do not blame that game on the game defense. Blame that game on Bill O'Reilly.

10
00:00:39,700 --> 00:00:40,200
Fuck you.

11
00:00:40,700 --> 00:00:41,700
What's that?

12
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:43,200
Cocksucker.

13
00:00:46,700 --> 00:00:47,200
What does that mean?

14
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:48,200
Playoffs.

15
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:50,200
Playoffs? Don't talk about it.

16
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:52,200
Playoffs? You kidding me?

17
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:53,200
Playoffs?

18
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:54,200
Playoffs.

19
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:55,200
Playoffs? Don't talk about it.

20
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:56,200
Playoffs? You kidding me?

21
00:00:56,200 --> 00:00:57,200
Playoffs?

22
00:00:58,200 --> 00:00:59,200
Do it live!

23
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:00,200
What what what?

24
00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:01,580
Do it live!

25
00:01:01,580 --> 00:01:02,200
What what what?

26
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:03,200
What does that mean?

27
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:04,200
What what what?

28
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:05,200
What does that mean?

29
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:06,200
What what what?

30
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:07,200
Do it live!

31
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:08,200
Playoffs.

32
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:09,200
Do it live!

33
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:10,200
Don't talk about it.

34
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:11,200
expandable

35
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:12,200
You kidding me?

36
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:13,200
What what what?

37
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:14,200
Playoffs?

38
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:15,200
I just hope we can win a game.

39
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:16,200
What does that mean?

40
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:18,200
I don't know what that is.

41
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:19,200
Step.

42
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:20,200
What does that mean?

43
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:21,200
I don't know what that means.

44
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:23,200
What does that mean?

45
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:25,200
Fuck you?

46
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:27,200
Fuck you?

47
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:29,200
I've just killed O'Reilly.

48
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:30,200
DIE!
