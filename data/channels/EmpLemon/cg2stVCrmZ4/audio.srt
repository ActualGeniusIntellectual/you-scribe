1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,760
Alright, everyone. So within the next week, YouTube is going to publish their big ol' YouTube Rewind for this year.

2
00:00:06,760 --> 00:00:13,400
It's gonna be this hip, cool video with celebrities and pop stars and all these pretty little smiling faces

3
00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:16,240
doing a hip and cool dance sequence and-

4
00:00:16,240 --> 00:00:20,080
Hey everybody! Look how hip and cool we are!

5
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:26,920
Come and watch this video! It has all your favorite YouTubers like Jimmy Kimmel, The Rock, Taylor Swift!

6
00:00:26,920 --> 00:00:35,160
Please give this video 300 million views so we can give off the impression that YouTube is a rip, roar, and fun time for the whole gang!

7
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:40,920
So yeah, that's gonna be the YouTube Rewind for this year. I just saved you six and a half minutes, so don't watch it.

8
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:49,040
It's gonna get 450 bazillion views anyway, though, because it's the kind of shit that trendy, mainstream dopes want to see.

9
00:00:49,080 --> 00:00:57,400
These normie pinheads who watch two videos a year are gonna see this flashy video of Hollywood celebrities dancing with attractive vloggers and think,

10
00:00:57,400 --> 00:01:02,960
oh boy, YouTube sure is great, and then go on with their lives like nothing's wrong.

11
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:10,440
And that's YouTube's goal here, to give off the perception that everything's cool! Alright! Yeah, party!

12
00:01:10,440 --> 00:01:19,000
You guys like country music star Blake Shelton? Look, he's holding an iPhone X while drinking a Starbucks Unicorn Frappuccino!

13
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:27,240
While spinning a fidget spinner! Those are trendy and popular things, right? Everybody dance! Whoa, look how great YouTube is!

14
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:29,280
Have you tried YouTube TV?

15
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:38,360
YouTube is gonna provide the ignorant masses with a glossy and colorful facade, all while sweeping their massive gaping problems under the rug.

16
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:47,120
Well, I'll tell you what, these problems aren't going away, and I'm not gonna sit back and let YouTube stand idly by and pretend that nothing's wrong.

17
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:55,280
I think I speak for a lot of YouTubers when I say that 2017 has been an absolute clusterfuck trainwreck for us content creators.

18
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:59,640
You know, the people that do all the work on this site and get none of the credit?

19
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:08,000
So what I've put together here is a real YouTube rewind, a recap of just some of the ways that YouTube has fucked over creators in the past year.

20
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:23,360
So to start off, YouTube reincarnated the defunct shit stain known as Google Plus in the form of the notification bell.

21
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:33,680
Of course, this was due to rampant allegations of YouTube failing to deliver subscriptions to subscribers, you know, the primary function of YouTube for millions of users.

22
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:40,800
We've heard these reports, and we take those feedback so seriously. YouTube doesn't unsubscribe people from channels.

23
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:46,480
Yeah, rather than fix the problem, they added an additional notification layer.

24
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:51,320
Now if you don't get notified of your subscriptions, it's your fault, and not YouTube's.

25
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:58,360
Because I guess it's too much to ask for YouTube to fix a fundamental function of their site that's been there since day fucking one.

26
00:02:58,360 --> 00:03:05,440
But hey, on the bright side, YouTubers now have to spend twice as long begging people to subscribe and press the notification bell.

27
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:09,800
Guys, guys, if you wonder around here, subscribe, because you won't even like it right now.

28
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:14,680
Oh yeah, and speaking of subscriptions, YouTube broke that too for a day. Yikes.

29
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:27,200
Now this was just a funny little glitch that had no real impact, other than the tremendous panic and uncertainty at the realization of YouTube's complete incompetence and failure to maintain the most basic of tasks on their website.

30
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:34,200
But hey, I'm sure these guys are professionals. There's no way they can possibly fuck up this badly again.

31
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:37,200
Introducing restricted mode!

32
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:48,640
So in March, YouTube rolled out their new and improved restricted mode, because YouTube really cares about children.

33
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:54,600
Clearly, some parents complained about their kids hearing some bad words on YouTube, oh lordy me!

34
00:03:54,600 --> 00:04:02,960
Because it's not like leaving your kid to roam unsupervised on a website used by all people, including adults, is bad parenting or anything.

35
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:07,520
It's clearly YouTube's fault for allowing videos with bad words to be shown at all.

36
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:14,480
So yeah, we're just gonna go ahead and erase, erase, erase, and there! 100% safe for kids!

37
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:22,480
Oh wait, YouTube, I think you guys missed a spot. These disturbing, borderline pornographic, borderline pedophiliac videos are still unrestricted.

38
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:26,480
Don't you guys think this is a bit of a problem?

39
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:30,480
Well, aren't you guys gonna do something about it?

40
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:34,480
Hello? YouTube? Anyone there?

41
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:39,480
We're sorry, you have reached a number that has been disconnected or is no longer in service.

42
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:42,480
I'm gay!

43
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:52,480
Looks like you accidentally restricted LGBT videos. Come on, YouTube, I thought you guys were more progressive than this.

44
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:59,480
Aren't you located in San Francisco of all places? Oh shit, it's a PR disaster. Quick, cover your asses!

45
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:02,480
We're sorry.

46
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:09,480
But hey, I'm sure these guys are professionals. There's no way they can possibly fuck up this badly again.

47
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:18,480
Hey everybody, look! PewDiePie is a Nazi! Here's proof! YouTube is running ads on racist videos!

48
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:23,480
Aw man, YouTube is racist? Time to pull our ads!

49
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:32,480
No, no, no, no, no, no, no. What the fuck are you doing? This was taken out of context. Please, this is just one video out of a billion.

50
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:38,480
For fuck's sake, YouTubers are just regular, non-racist people. Please don't pull your bye-bye ads.

51
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:45,480
Shit, shit, this is bad. This is really bad. YouTube, what are you gonna do about this?

52
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:47,480
Well, you know, they kind of have a point.

53
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:49,480
What?

54
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:54,480
Yeah, they're right. No company should be forced to advertise on racist videos.

55
00:05:54,480 --> 00:06:00,480
Good, good, yes, yes, we agree on that much. Take the ads off of the racist videos. That's perfect.

56
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:05,480
Look, we can start by making sure that videos with an N-word in the title can't run ads.

57
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:12,480
Alright then, it's settled. Any video with slightly controversial content will be demonetized from here on out.

58
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:13,480
What?

59
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:18,480
That's right, ladies and gentlemen. You get demonetized. You get demonetized.

60
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:20,480
Talking about drugs? Demonetized.

61
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:23,480
Talking about politics? Demonetized.

62
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:27,480
Talking about any video game with a gun in it? Demonetized.

63
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:31,480
Talking about WWE, which is literally PG Entertainment?

64
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:33,480
Oh, you better believe that you're demonetized.

65
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:37,480
Say one single curse word? Say goodbye to your ad revenue?

66
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:41,480
Upload a video that's completely within the guidelines and hasn't even finished processing yet?

67
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:44,480
Well, we're just gonna demonetize that too.

68
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:50,480
We're scanning your video transcripts, so if you say one tiny thing that's out of place, we're gonna ding ya!

69
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:55,480
So make sure to be on your best behavior, because Big Brother is watching.

70
00:06:55,480 --> 00:07:02,480
Oh yeah, so we didn't mention this at first, but it turns out that all the demonetization will be carried out by an experimental bot

71
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:08,480
that's literally machine learning as it goes on and will be completely inaccurate and trigger-happy for the first six months,

72
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:11,480
robbing YouTubers of millions of dollars of revenue for no reason?

73
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:19,480
Oh, and in addition to demonetizing your videos, we'll also straight up censor them by sandbagging their search and discovery in the algorithm,

74
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:22,480
even after they're manually reviewed to be advertiser-friendly.

75
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:27,480
Oh, and remember back when we said that we love LGBT people?

76
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:30,480
Yeah, we're still censoring their videos behind their backs anyway.

77
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:32,480
Suicide prevention videos too.

78
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:37,480
So sleep tight, because the demonetization fairy will visit you when you least expect it.

79
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:39,480
And poof, there goes all your money!

80
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:41,480
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

81
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:44,480
Okay, just hold up for one second.

82
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:47,480
Don't you think this is a bit of an overreaction?

83
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:49,480
Think about why you guys are doing this.

84
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:52,480
Because of PewDiePie, PewDiePie's not a racist.

85
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:54,480
You guys need to calm down.

86
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:56,480
PewDiePie's not racist, and neither are the rest of us.

87
00:07:57,480 --> 00:08:02,480
So maybe you guys could hold off for a bit on destroying the dreams of thousands and thousands of-

88
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:03,480
What a fucking nigger.

89
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:16,480
Nigger.

90
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:19,480
Dude, what the fuck did you just do?

91
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:21,480
Come on, Felix!

92
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:25,480
We were all counting on you to prove YouTube and the advertisers wrong,

93
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:28,480
and then you just go ahead and drop the n-bomb on stream.

94
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:30,480
What the fuck, dude?

95
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:36,480
Look, Felix, I like you, and I know that at the end of the day, you're on our side.

96
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:43,480
But you have to realize the tremendous responsibility you have not to fuck things up for the rest of us.

97
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:44,480
And guess what?

98
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:47,480
You completely fucked things up for the rest of us.

99
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:50,480
I know it's easy for you and the rest of the big wigs at the top of the site

100
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:54,480
to just sit back and relax on your seven-figure YouTube income,

101
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:56,480
but for the rest of us, it ain't so easy.

102
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:58,480
And you just made it a lot harder.

103
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:04,480
Now there are no more excuses stopping YouTube from stamping every last one of our videos with the yellow sticker of shame.

104
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:10,480
Aw, man.

105
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:12,480
This is a serious problem.

106
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:14,480
This issue has major ramifications.

107
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:17,480
What's gonna happen to the future of content on this website?

108
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:20,480
What's gonna happen to everyone who depends on YouTube for income?

109
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:21,480
What's gonna happen to-

110
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:22,480
Hey, look, everybody!

111
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:23,480
Fidget spinners!

112
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:25,480
Aw, look at that!

113
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:26,480
They spin!

114
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:28,480
Ooh, look at how trendy they are!

115
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:30,480
So many to collect!

116
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:31,480
Alright!

117
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:33,480
Remember when these were just tools to help autistic kids?

118
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:34,480
Wait, wait, wait, stop!

119
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:37,480
We're trying to have a serious discussion about an important issue here.

120
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:38,480
Hey, look, everybody!

121
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:40,480
It's Jake Paul!

122
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:42,480
Ooh, Team 10, dab on those haters!

123
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:44,480
Jake Paul is trending!

124
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:45,480
Woo!

125
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:46,480
Hey, what's going on?

126
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:49,480
There are more important things to talk about here.

127
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:52,480
It's almost like you're trying to distract us or something.

128
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:53,480
Hey, look, everybody!

129
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:58,480
Some pussy-ass white boy millionaire is making a diss track about God knows what!

130
00:09:58,480 --> 00:09:59,480
Wait, what the fuck?

131
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:01,480
How has this become a trend?

132
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:03,480
Wait a minute, weren't we talking about something else here?

133
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:04,480
Hey, look, everybody!

134
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:06,480
VidCon!

135
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:07,480
Ooh, VidCon.

136
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:11,480
I can't wait to see a showcase of the best and brightest personalities that YouTube has to offer.

137
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:37,480
Oh god, is this what we've become?

138
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:40,480
Are there any honest YouTubers left anymore?

139
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:45,480
Oh hey, here's a cool and original animation that probably took a year of on-and-off work to make.

140
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:49,480
Man, people really seem to love this video, so let's take it down, for no reason.

141
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:51,480
The shameless re-upload can stay up though.

142
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:58,480
In fact, let's just have everybody profit off of this guy's hard work except, you know, the guy who actually made the video.

143
00:10:58,480 --> 00:10:59,480
We can just forget about him.

144
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:05,480
Oh hey, it's one of the most dedicated and influential YouTubers on the platform, Anthony Fantano!

145
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:09,480
Let's demonetize his entire meme channel for basically no reason.

146
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:12,480
Oh, and this mumkey guy?

147
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:18,480
Let's take his channel down for no reason and straight up lie to his face with our automated enforcement system,

148
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:23,480
all while holding his main source of income and total livelihood in virtual limbo.

149
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:28,480
Because YouTube as we know it has basically become an Orwellian dystopia manifested in reality.

150
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:32,480
Oh yeah, let's just suspend I Ate Everything again for no reason just for funsies.

151
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:37,480
But hey, I'm sure these guys are professionals.

152
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:41,480
There's no way they can possibly fuck up this badly again.

153
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:42,480
Everybody duck!

154
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:43,480
Why?

155
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:47,480
Oh, it's just that time of the year where everyone in America dies to a mass shooting.

156
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:52,480
Damn, this one's really bad.

157
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:55,480
This is actually the deadliest mass shooting in American history.

158
00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:57,480
Oh jeez, what a tragedy.

159
00:11:57,480 --> 00:11:59,480
What a horrific loss of life.

160
00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:00,480
What a-

161
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:01,480
Hey, wait a minute.

162
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:03,480
CNN is running ads on a live shooting?

163
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:06,480
Wait a minute, soda companies?

164
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:08,480
The same ones that boycotted YouTube?

165
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:11,480
They're advertising on a live shooting?

166
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:12,480
What are you guys doing?

167
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:16,480
You guys are shameless enough to advertise on actual human slaughter,

168
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:21,480
but you pull your ads from YouTube because of one racially questionable video?

169
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:26,480
Uh, sorry, we can't hear you over the thuds of limp corpses hitting the ground.

170
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:28,480
Oh my gosh, this is a total disaster.

171
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:30,480
We need to help these people.

172
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:34,480
Oh thank Christ, esteemed and iconic YouTuber Casey Neistat

173
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:38,480
uploaded a video where all the ad revenue will be donated to victims of the shooting.

174
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:41,480
At least there's some good coming out of YouTube these days.

175
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:44,480
And you get demonetized.

176
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:48,480
Wait a minute, YouTube, this is a charity video that's only meant to help people.

177
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:50,480
Why are you preventing that?

178
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:51,480
Sorry, it's against the rules.

179
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:53,480
No ads on videos about tragedies.

180
00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:55,480
No exceptions.

181
00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:58,480
Meanwhile, at Jimmy Kimmel's channel...

182
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:15,480
You see, Jimmy, Jimmy, Jim, Jim, Jimmy, Jim, James, son, let me tell you a little bit about virtue signaling.

183
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:21,480
Hey, Jimmy, are you at least going to donate that ad revenue you earn from a tragedy to the victims of the tragedy?

184
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:24,480
No? You're just going to keep it?

185
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:27,480
Yeah, that $10 million TV salary isn't enough for you?

186
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:35,480
Oh, and that's not all? You're going to virtue signal all of us too and tell us how it's all our fault that lunatics get illegal guns and shoot people?

187
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:40,480
Because who on earth could question the moral righteousness of a guy from Hollywood?

188
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:44,480
Oh wait, they're all sexual predators? Hmm.

189
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:46,480
Well that makes them perfect for YouTube.

190
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:53,480
Because YouTube allowed a massive pedophile ring to propagate content on their platform.

191
00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:59,480
And even though the commentary community complained about them for months, YouTube did nothing about it.

192
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:10,480
In fact, I'm willing to say that YouTube actually supported these degenerate videos with unrestricted ads while at the same time demonetizing the channels trying to expose them.

193
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:15,480
Man, funding pedophiles. Isn't YouTube in 2017 just fun on the bun?

194
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:22,480
Of course, YouTube finally got off their asses and did something about this massive problem that their system literally helped to create.

195
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:32,480
We got to definitely write a song about how we do not diddle kids. Do not diddle kids. It's no good diddling kids.

196
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:39,480
Only after suffering a PR disaster and having, you're going to love this, even more companies pull their ads.

197
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:41,480
Hmm, wait a minute here.

198
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:48,480
Now why would YouTube all of a sudden care about a problem that the YouTube community has been aware of for months?

199
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:49,480
Hmm.

200
00:14:49,480 --> 00:15:00,480
Why would YouTube knowingly endanger children for so long if they care so much about child safety that they punish the rest of us for the most miniscule inappropriate gesture?

201
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:02,480
Hmm.

202
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:10,480
Why would YouTube ignore a known and serious child endangerment problem until the moment it cost them ad revenue?

203
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:17,480
Oh boy, it's almost like YouTube doesn't care about kids at all and they only care about the revenue they bring to the site.

204
00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:22,480
But if that were true, that would make YouTube a ruthless money hungry corporation.

205
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:24,480
Now that can't be right.

206
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:27,480
Just look at their CEO, Susan Woodj-

207
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:30,480
Su- Susan Woodj-

208
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:33,480
Susan Dubya! Good ol' Susan Dubya!

209
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:36,480
She clearly cares about us humble creators.

210
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:38,480
She's a woman of the people.

211
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:44,480
And definitely not a figurehead puppet put in power by Google's blatant nepotism and diversity quotas.

212
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:50,480
Clearly, she is the most qualified person in the world to run the largest video streaming site on the internet.

213
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:54,480
Oh wait, she's never even attempted to run a YouTube channel before this year.

214
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:59,480
So she has literally no experience making YouTube videos.

215
00:15:59,480 --> 00:16:01,480
And she's in charge of YouTube.

216
00:16:01,480 --> 00:16:03,480
Like, the whole entire website.

217
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:04,480
Yikes!

218
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:07,480
You know, come to think of it, that actually makes a lot of sense.

219
00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:12,480
Jesus, is there any relief from the torrent of bad news that this site has to offer this year?

220
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:17,480
What we do here is go back.

221
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:23,480
Oh hey, a new content cop!

222
00:16:23,480 --> 00:16:25,480
God bless you, iDubbbz.

223
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:29,480
Thanks for keeping YouTubers honest, one douche at a time.

224
00:16:29,480 --> 00:16:34,480
It's so nice to see that YouTube is as supportive of your channel as the rest of us.

225
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:39,480
They clearly show it by demonetizing your videos, taking down your video for no reason,

226
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:44,480
blacklisting you from trending even though your videos are some of the hottest properties on this website,

227
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:47,480
and even letting your channel get hacked and terminated.

228
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:48,480
Just for a little bit though.

229
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:54,480
I guess it's become a tradition for decent YouTubers to have their channels taken down at least once a year for no reason.

230
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:57,480
But who could blame YouTube for letting that happen?

231
00:16:57,480 --> 00:17:02,480
You're just a regular guy who got famous through nothing but his own talent and hard work.

232
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:06,480
You're nothing like world famous pop star Justin Bieber!

233
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:11,480
Hey, did you know that a song sang by Justin Bieber is the most viewed YouTube video now?

234
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:17,480
Man, couple that with YouTubers making no money, and I'd say we've regressed back to 2009!

235
00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:24,480
You know, besides all the YouTube actively censoring content and funding pedophiles deal, 2009 was a simpler time.

236
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:34,480
And what better way to top the shit Sunday of YouTube in 2017 than with a bright red new eyesore logo and another pointless layout change that nobody asked for?

237
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:40,480
And that, ladies and gentlemen, was the YouTube reality check rewind of 2017.

238
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:47,480
Now, if you're like me and you just watched all of that, you're probably just a little teensy weensy bit miffed.

239
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:52,480
And if you're a robot with no emotions or common sense, then congratulations!

240
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:55,480
You are now employed by YouTube management.

241
00:17:55,480 --> 00:18:03,480
But if you're like the rest of us who are a little bit dissatisfied with the way things are run around here, then you're probably wondering, what can I do about it?

242
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:06,480
Well, fear not, citizen, for I have a plan.

243
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:08,480
Bob is building an army!

244
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:12,480
I'm kidding, of course. Fuck you, Bob. Nobody cares about you.

245
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:15,480
But what we do care about is your tank.

246
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:21,480
That's right, ladies and gentlemen. I am proposing that this year, we tank the rewind.

247
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:24,480
Every YouTube channel has a little bit of power.

248
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:26,480
Individually, it's basically worthless.

249
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:33,480
But by combining that power with millions of other channels, you can craft a force to be reckoned with.

250
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:36,480
The power I'm speaking of is the power of the dislike.

251
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:42,480
It's a fundamental power endowed to every YouTuber on this website.

252
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:47,480
And we can harness that power to punch YouTube square in their fucking jaw.

253
00:18:47,480 --> 00:18:53,480
What I'm suggesting is that we harness all of our powers to dislike this year's YouTube rewind.

254
00:18:53,480 --> 00:19:00,480
Our goal should be to make this year's rewind the most disliked YouTube video of all time.

255
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:01,480
We can do this, guys.

256
00:19:01,480 --> 00:19:06,480
We already made EA's Battlefront comment the most downvoted Reddit post of all time,

257
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:09,480
and we can do the same with this year's rewind.

258
00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:12,480
We're gonna need about 8.5 million dislikes to accomplish this,

259
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:18,480
but I think YouTube has generated enough aggregate outrage this year that it's totally possible.

260
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:24,480
Over the past year, YouTube has made mistake after mistake after mistake,

261
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:30,480
and it seems like the only ones being punished for their mistakes are us, the creators.

262
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:36,480
We ask YouTube for answers, and we're met with worthless automated responses.

263
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:40,480
YouTube says they're listening, yet things continue to get worse and worse,

264
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:43,480
and YouTube continues to lie to our faces.

265
00:19:43,480 --> 00:19:49,480
We've tried complaining. We have tried reasoning with YouTube over and over,

266
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:53,480
and they've proven time and time again that they don't listen.

267
00:19:53,480 --> 00:19:57,480
So we're gonna hit them where it hurts, right in their big end-of-the-year celebration.

268
00:19:57,480 --> 00:20:01,480
And maybe, just maybe, they'll listen to us.

269
00:20:01,480 --> 00:20:07,480
YouTube in 2017 has been a total unmitigated embarrassment.

270
00:20:07,480 --> 00:20:15,480
So just imagine the embarrassment of YouTube's big happy party becoming the most disliked video of all time.

271
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:19,480
These are the measures we must take to get YouTube's attention.

272
00:20:19,480 --> 00:20:21,480
YouTube thinks they can just forget about us.

273
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:26,480
They think they can just forget about all these problems, and all of it will just disappear.

274
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:31,480
They'll hire a bunch of smiling Hollywood faces to try and distract everyone

275
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:37,480
from all the debilitating problems that they have allowed to fall upon this once great website.

276
00:20:37,480 --> 00:20:40,480
Well, I'm here to say that enough is enough.

277
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:43,480
YouTube wasn't built by Hollywood celebrities.

278
00:20:43,480 --> 00:20:45,480
YouTube was built by the people.

279
00:20:45,480 --> 00:20:47,480
YouTube was built by us.

280
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:53,480
And I'm not gonna stand by for another year while all these fake smiling Hollywood people

281
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:58,480
party it up on the penthouse of the empire that we built.

282
00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:02,480
So if you're like me and you want to see some actual positive change around here,

283
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:06,480
then join me in pressing dislike on this year's YouTube Rewind.

284
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:10,480
YouTube is going to demonetize and censor this video.

285
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:16,480
So I encourage you all to share this video, download this video, and repost this video far and wide.

286
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:22,480
I encourage you all to share this video with other YouTubers that YouTube has screwed over this year

287
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:24,480
and get them on board too.

288
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:29,480
It's time for us, the real YouTubers, to stick up for ourselves.

289
00:21:29,480 --> 00:21:32,480
It's time to tank the rewind.
