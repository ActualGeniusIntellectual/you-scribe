0	6760	Alright, everyone. So within the next week, YouTube is going to publish their big ol' YouTube Rewind for this year.
6760	13400	It's gonna be this hip, cool video with celebrities and pop stars and all these pretty little smiling faces
13400	16240	doing a hip and cool dance sequence and-
16240	20080	Hey everybody! Look how hip and cool we are!
20080	26920	Come and watch this video! It has all your favorite YouTubers like Jimmy Kimmel, The Rock, Taylor Swift!
26920	35160	Please give this video 300 million views so we can give off the impression that YouTube is a rip, roar, and fun time for the whole gang!
35160	40920	So yeah, that's gonna be the YouTube Rewind for this year. I just saved you six and a half minutes, so don't watch it.
40920	49040	It's gonna get 450 bazillion views anyway, though, because it's the kind of shit that trendy, mainstream dopes want to see.
49080	57400	These normie pinheads who watch two videos a year are gonna see this flashy video of Hollywood celebrities dancing with attractive vloggers and think,
57400	62960	oh boy, YouTube sure is great, and then go on with their lives like nothing's wrong.
62960	70440	And that's YouTube's goal here, to give off the perception that everything's cool! Alright! Yeah, party!
70440	79000	You guys like country music star Blake Shelton? Look, he's holding an iPhone X while drinking a Starbucks Unicorn Frappuccino!
79040	87240	While spinning a fidget spinner! Those are trendy and popular things, right? Everybody dance! Whoa, look how great YouTube is!
87240	89280	Have you tried YouTube TV?
89280	98360	YouTube is gonna provide the ignorant masses with a glossy and colorful facade, all while sweeping their massive gaping problems under the rug.
98360	107120	Well, I'll tell you what, these problems aren't going away, and I'm not gonna sit back and let YouTube stand idly by and pretend that nothing's wrong.
107120	115280	I think I speak for a lot of YouTubers when I say that 2017 has been an absolute clusterfuck trainwreck for us content creators.
115280	119640	You know, the people that do all the work on this site and get none of the credit?
119640	128000	So what I've put together here is a real YouTube rewind, a recap of just some of the ways that YouTube has fucked over creators in the past year.
128000	143360	So to start off, YouTube reincarnated the defunct shit stain known as Google Plus in the form of the notification bell.
143360	153680	Of course, this was due to rampant allegations of YouTube failing to deliver subscriptions to subscribers, you know, the primary function of YouTube for millions of users.
153680	160800	We've heard these reports, and we take those feedback so seriously. YouTube doesn't unsubscribe people from channels.
162240	166480	Yeah, rather than fix the problem, they added an additional notification layer.
166480	171320	Now if you don't get notified of your subscriptions, it's your fault, and not YouTube's.
171320	178360	Because I guess it's too much to ask for YouTube to fix a fundamental function of their site that's been there since day fucking one.
178360	185440	But hey, on the bright side, YouTubers now have to spend twice as long begging people to subscribe and press the notification bell.
185440	189800	Guys, guys, if you wonder around here, subscribe, because you won't even like it right now.
189800	194680	Oh yeah, and speaking of subscriptions, YouTube broke that too for a day. Yikes.
194680	207200	Now this was just a funny little glitch that had no real impact, other than the tremendous panic and uncertainty at the realization of YouTube's complete incompetence and failure to maintain the most basic of tasks on their website.
207200	214200	But hey, I'm sure these guys are professionals. There's no way they can possibly fuck up this badly again.
214200	217200	Introducing restricted mode!
221200	228640	So in March, YouTube rolled out their new and improved restricted mode, because YouTube really cares about children.
228640	234600	Clearly, some parents complained about their kids hearing some bad words on YouTube, oh lordy me!
234600	242960	Because it's not like leaving your kid to roam unsupervised on a website used by all people, including adults, is bad parenting or anything.
242960	247520	It's clearly YouTube's fault for allowing videos with bad words to be shown at all.
247520	254480	So yeah, we're just gonna go ahead and erase, erase, erase, and there! 100% safe for kids!
254480	262480	Oh wait, YouTube, I think you guys missed a spot. These disturbing, borderline pornographic, borderline pedophiliac videos are still unrestricted.
264480	266480	Don't you guys think this is a bit of a problem?
268480	270480	Well, aren't you guys gonna do something about it?
271480	274480	Hello? YouTube? Anyone there?
275480	279480	We're sorry, you have reached a number that has been disconnected or is no longer in service.
280480	282480	I'm gay!
285480	292480	Looks like you accidentally restricted LGBT videos. Come on, YouTube, I thought you guys were more progressive than this.
292480	299480	Aren't you located in San Francisco of all places? Oh shit, it's a PR disaster. Quick, cover your asses!
300480	302480	We're sorry.
303480	309480	But hey, I'm sure these guys are professionals. There's no way they can possibly fuck up this badly again.
310480	318480	Hey everybody, look! PewDiePie is a Nazi! Here's proof! YouTube is running ads on racist videos!
319480	323480	Aw man, YouTube is racist? Time to pull our ads!
325480	332480	No, no, no, no, no, no, no. What the fuck are you doing? This was taken out of context. Please, this is just one video out of a billion.
332480	338480	For fuck's sake, YouTubers are just regular, non-racist people. Please don't pull your bye-bye ads.
339480	345480	Shit, shit, this is bad. This is really bad. YouTube, what are you gonna do about this?
345480	347480	Well, you know, they kind of have a point.
348480	349480	What?
349480	354480	Yeah, they're right. No company should be forced to advertise on racist videos.
354480	360480	Good, good, yes, yes, we agree on that much. Take the ads off of the racist videos. That's perfect.
360480	365480	Look, we can start by making sure that videos with an N-word in the title can't run ads.
365480	372480	Alright then, it's settled. Any video with slightly controversial content will be demonetized from here on out.
372480	373480	What?
373480	378480	That's right, ladies and gentlemen. You get demonetized. You get demonetized.
378480	380480	Talking about drugs? Demonetized.
380480	383480	Talking about politics? Demonetized.
383480	387480	Talking about any video game with a gun in it? Demonetized.
387480	391480	Talking about WWE, which is literally PG Entertainment?
391480	393480	Oh, you better believe that you're demonetized.
393480	397480	Say one single curse word? Say goodbye to your ad revenue?
397480	401480	Upload a video that's completely within the guidelines and hasn't even finished processing yet?
401480	404480	Well, we're just gonna demonetize that too.
404480	410480	We're scanning your video transcripts, so if you say one tiny thing that's out of place, we're gonna ding ya!
410480	415480	So make sure to be on your best behavior, because Big Brother is watching.
415480	422480	Oh yeah, so we didn't mention this at first, but it turns out that all the demonetization will be carried out by an experimental bot
422480	428480	that's literally machine learning as it goes on and will be completely inaccurate and trigger-happy for the first six months,
428480	431480	robbing YouTubers of millions of dollars of revenue for no reason?
431480	439480	Oh, and in addition to demonetizing your videos, we'll also straight up censor them by sandbagging their search and discovery in the algorithm,
439480	442480	even after they're manually reviewed to be advertiser-friendly.
442480	447480	Oh, and remember back when we said that we love LGBT people?
447480	450480	Yeah, we're still censoring their videos behind their backs anyway.
450480	452480	Suicide prevention videos too.
452480	457480	So sleep tight, because the demonetization fairy will visit you when you least expect it.
457480	459480	And poof, there goes all your money!
459480	461480	Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
461480	464480	Okay, just hold up for one second.
464480	467480	Don't you think this is a bit of an overreaction?
467480	469480	Think about why you guys are doing this.
469480	472480	Because of PewDiePie, PewDiePie's not a racist.
472480	474480	You guys need to calm down.
474480	476480	PewDiePie's not racist, and neither are the rest of us.
477480	482480	So maybe you guys could hold off for a bit on destroying the dreams of thousands and thousands of-
482480	483480	What a fucking nigger.
495480	496480	Nigger.
496480	499480	Dude, what the fuck did you just do?
499480	501480	Come on, Felix!
501480	505480	We were all counting on you to prove YouTube and the advertisers wrong,
505480	508480	and then you just go ahead and drop the n-bomb on stream.
508480	510480	What the fuck, dude?
510480	516480	Look, Felix, I like you, and I know that at the end of the day, you're on our side.
516480	523480	But you have to realize the tremendous responsibility you have not to fuck things up for the rest of us.
523480	524480	And guess what?
524480	527480	You completely fucked things up for the rest of us.
527480	530480	I know it's easy for you and the rest of the big wigs at the top of the site
530480	534480	to just sit back and relax on your seven-figure YouTube income,
534480	536480	but for the rest of us, it ain't so easy.
536480	538480	And you just made it a lot harder.
538480	544480	Now there are no more excuses stopping YouTube from stamping every last one of our videos with the yellow sticker of shame.
549480	550480	Aw, man.
550480	552480	This is a serious problem.
552480	554480	This issue has major ramifications.
554480	557480	What's gonna happen to the future of content on this website?
557480	560480	What's gonna happen to everyone who depends on YouTube for income?
560480	561480	What's gonna happen to-
561480	562480	Hey, look, everybody!
562480	563480	Fidget spinners!
563480	565480	Aw, look at that!
565480	566480	They spin!
566480	568480	Ooh, look at how trendy they are!
568480	570480	So many to collect!
570480	571480	Alright!
571480	573480	Remember when these were just tools to help autistic kids?
573480	574480	Wait, wait, wait, stop!
574480	577480	We're trying to have a serious discussion about an important issue here.
577480	578480	Hey, look, everybody!
578480	580480	It's Jake Paul!
580480	582480	Ooh, Team 10, dab on those haters!
582480	584480	Jake Paul is trending!
584480	585480	Woo!
585480	586480	Hey, what's going on?
586480	589480	There are more important things to talk about here.
589480	592480	It's almost like you're trying to distract us or something.
592480	593480	Hey, look, everybody!
593480	598480	Some pussy-ass white boy millionaire is making a diss track about God knows what!
598480	599480	Wait, what the fuck?
599480	601480	How has this become a trend?
601480	603480	Wait a minute, weren't we talking about something else here?
603480	604480	Hey, look, everybody!
604480	606480	VidCon!
606480	607480	Ooh, VidCon.
607480	611480	I can't wait to see a showcase of the best and brightest personalities that YouTube has to offer.
611480	637480	Oh god, is this what we've become?
637480	640480	Are there any honest YouTubers left anymore?
640480	645480	Oh hey, here's a cool and original animation that probably took a year of on-and-off work to make.
645480	649480	Man, people really seem to love this video, so let's take it down, for no reason.
649480	651480	The shameless re-upload can stay up though.
651480	658480	In fact, let's just have everybody profit off of this guy's hard work except, you know, the guy who actually made the video.
658480	659480	We can just forget about him.
659480	665480	Oh hey, it's one of the most dedicated and influential YouTubers on the platform, Anthony Fantano!
665480	669480	Let's demonetize his entire meme channel for basically no reason.
670480	672480	Oh, and this mumkey guy?
672480	678480	Let's take his channel down for no reason and straight up lie to his face with our automated enforcement system,
678480	683480	all while holding his main source of income and total livelihood in virtual limbo.
683480	688480	Because YouTube as we know it has basically become an Orwellian dystopia manifested in reality.
688480	692480	Oh yeah, let's just suspend I Ate Everything again for no reason just for funsies.
694480	697480	But hey, I'm sure these guys are professionals.
697480	701480	There's no way they can possibly fuck up this badly again.
701480	702480	Everybody duck!
702480	703480	Why?
703480	707480	Oh, it's just that time of the year where everyone in America dies to a mass shooting.
710480	712480	Damn, this one's really bad.
712480	715480	This is actually the deadliest mass shooting in American history.
715480	717480	Oh jeez, what a tragedy.
717480	719480	What a horrific loss of life.
719480	720480	What a-
720480	721480	Hey, wait a minute.
721480	723480	CNN is running ads on a live shooting?
723480	726480	Wait a minute, soda companies?
726480	728480	The same ones that boycotted YouTube?
728480	731480	They're advertising on a live shooting?
731480	732480	What are you guys doing?
732480	736480	You guys are shameless enough to advertise on actual human slaughter,
736480	741480	but you pull your ads from YouTube because of one racially questionable video?
741480	746480	Uh, sorry, we can't hear you over the thuds of limp corpses hitting the ground.
746480	748480	Oh my gosh, this is a total disaster.
748480	750480	We need to help these people.
750480	754480	Oh thank Christ, esteemed and iconic YouTuber Casey Neistat
754480	758480	uploaded a video where all the ad revenue will be donated to victims of the shooting.
758480	761480	At least there's some good coming out of YouTube these days.
761480	764480	And you get demonetized.
764480	768480	Wait a minute, YouTube, this is a charity video that's only meant to help people.
768480	770480	Why are you preventing that?
770480	771480	Sorry, it's against the rules.
771480	773480	No ads on videos about tragedies.
773480	775480	No exceptions.
775480	778480	Meanwhile, at Jimmy Kimmel's channel...
780480	795480	You see, Jimmy, Jimmy, Jim, Jim, Jimmy, Jim, James, son, let me tell you a little bit about virtue signaling.
795480	801480	Hey, Jimmy, are you at least going to donate that ad revenue you earn from a tragedy to the victims of the tragedy?
801480	804480	No? You're just going to keep it?
804480	807480	Yeah, that $10 million TV salary isn't enough for you?
807480	815480	Oh, and that's not all? You're going to virtue signal all of us too and tell us how it's all our fault that lunatics get illegal guns and shoot people?
815480	820480	Because who on earth could question the moral righteousness of a guy from Hollywood?
820480	824480	Oh wait, they're all sexual predators? Hmm.
824480	826480	Well that makes them perfect for YouTube.
826480	833480	Because YouTube allowed a massive pedophile ring to propagate content on their platform.
833480	839480	And even though the commentary community complained about them for months, YouTube did nothing about it.
839480	850480	In fact, I'm willing to say that YouTube actually supported these degenerate videos with unrestricted ads while at the same time demonetizing the channels trying to expose them.
850480	855480	Man, funding pedophiles. Isn't YouTube in 2017 just fun on the bun?
855480	862480	Of course, YouTube finally got off their asses and did something about this massive problem that their system literally helped to create.
864480	872480	We got to definitely write a song about how we do not diddle kids. Do not diddle kids. It's no good diddling kids.
872480	879480	Only after suffering a PR disaster and having, you're going to love this, even more companies pull their ads.
879480	881480	Hmm, wait a minute here.
881480	888480	Now why would YouTube all of a sudden care about a problem that the YouTube community has been aware of for months?
888480	889480	Hmm.
889480	900480	Why would YouTube knowingly endanger children for so long if they care so much about child safety that they punish the rest of us for the most miniscule inappropriate gesture?
900480	902480	Hmm.
902480	910480	Why would YouTube ignore a known and serious child endangerment problem until the moment it cost them ad revenue?
910480	917480	Oh boy, it's almost like YouTube doesn't care about kids at all and they only care about the revenue they bring to the site.
917480	922480	But if that were true, that would make YouTube a ruthless money hungry corporation.
922480	924480	Now that can't be right.
924480	927480	Just look at their CEO, Susan Woodj-
927480	930480	Su- Susan Woodj-
930480	933480	Susan Dubya! Good ol' Susan Dubya!
933480	936480	She clearly cares about us humble creators.
936480	938480	She's a woman of the people.
938480	944480	And definitely not a figurehead puppet put in power by Google's blatant nepotism and diversity quotas.
944480	950480	Clearly, she is the most qualified person in the world to run the largest video streaming site on the internet.
950480	954480	Oh wait, she's never even attempted to run a YouTube channel before this year.
954480	959480	So she has literally no experience making YouTube videos.
959480	961480	And she's in charge of YouTube.
961480	963480	Like, the whole entire website.
963480	964480	Yikes!
964480	967480	You know, come to think of it, that actually makes a lot of sense.
967480	972480	Jesus, is there any relief from the torrent of bad news that this site has to offer this year?
972480	977480	What we do here is go back.
981480	983480	Oh hey, a new content cop!
983480	985480	God bless you, iDubbbz.
985480	989480	Thanks for keeping YouTubers honest, one douche at a time.
989480	994480	It's so nice to see that YouTube is as supportive of your channel as the rest of us.
994480	999480	They clearly show it by demonetizing your videos, taking down your video for no reason,
999480	1004480	blacklisting you from trending even though your videos are some of the hottest properties on this website,
1004480	1007480	and even letting your channel get hacked and terminated.
1007480	1008480	Just for a little bit though.
1008480	1014480	I guess it's become a tradition for decent YouTubers to have their channels taken down at least once a year for no reason.
1014480	1017480	But who could blame YouTube for letting that happen?
1017480	1022480	You're just a regular guy who got famous through nothing but his own talent and hard work.
1022480	1026480	You're nothing like world famous pop star Justin Bieber!
1026480	1031480	Hey, did you know that a song sang by Justin Bieber is the most viewed YouTube video now?
1031480	1037480	Man, couple that with YouTubers making no money, and I'd say we've regressed back to 2009!
1037480	1044480	You know, besides all the YouTube actively censoring content and funding pedophiles deal, 2009 was a simpler time.
1044480	1054480	And what better way to top the shit Sunday of YouTube in 2017 than with a bright red new eyesore logo and another pointless layout change that nobody asked for?
1054480	1060480	And that, ladies and gentlemen, was the YouTube reality check rewind of 2017.
1060480	1067480	Now, if you're like me and you just watched all of that, you're probably just a little teensy weensy bit miffed.
1067480	1072480	And if you're a robot with no emotions or common sense, then congratulations!
1072480	1075480	You are now employed by YouTube management.
1075480	1083480	But if you're like the rest of us who are a little bit dissatisfied with the way things are run around here, then you're probably wondering, what can I do about it?
1083480	1086480	Well, fear not, citizen, for I have a plan.
1086480	1088480	Bob is building an army!
1088480	1092480	I'm kidding, of course. Fuck you, Bob. Nobody cares about you.
1092480	1095480	But what we do care about is your tank.
1095480	1101480	That's right, ladies and gentlemen. I am proposing that this year, we tank the rewind.
1101480	1104480	Every YouTube channel has a little bit of power.
1104480	1106480	Individually, it's basically worthless.
1106480	1113480	But by combining that power with millions of other channels, you can craft a force to be reckoned with.
1113480	1116480	The power I'm speaking of is the power of the dislike.
1116480	1122480	It's a fundamental power endowed to every YouTuber on this website.
1122480	1127480	And we can harness that power to punch YouTube square in their fucking jaw.
1127480	1133480	What I'm suggesting is that we harness all of our powers to dislike this year's YouTube rewind.
1133480	1140480	Our goal should be to make this year's rewind the most disliked YouTube video of all time.
1140480	1141480	We can do this, guys.
1141480	1146480	We already made EA's Battlefront comment the most downvoted Reddit post of all time,
1146480	1149480	and we can do the same with this year's rewind.
1149480	1152480	We're gonna need about 8.5 million dislikes to accomplish this,
1152480	1158480	but I think YouTube has generated enough aggregate outrage this year that it's totally possible.
1158480	1164480	Over the past year, YouTube has made mistake after mistake after mistake,
1164480	1170480	and it seems like the only ones being punished for their mistakes are us, the creators.
1170480	1176480	We ask YouTube for answers, and we're met with worthless automated responses.
1176480	1180480	YouTube says they're listening, yet things continue to get worse and worse,
1180480	1183480	and YouTube continues to lie to our faces.
1183480	1189480	We've tried complaining. We have tried reasoning with YouTube over and over,
1189480	1193480	and they've proven time and time again that they don't listen.
1193480	1197480	So we're gonna hit them where it hurts, right in their big end-of-the-year celebration.
1197480	1201480	And maybe, just maybe, they'll listen to us.
1201480	1207480	YouTube in 2017 has been a total unmitigated embarrassment.
1207480	1215480	So just imagine the embarrassment of YouTube's big happy party becoming the most disliked video of all time.
1215480	1219480	These are the measures we must take to get YouTube's attention.
1219480	1221480	YouTube thinks they can just forget about us.
1221480	1226480	They think they can just forget about all these problems, and all of it will just disappear.
1226480	1231480	They'll hire a bunch of smiling Hollywood faces to try and distract everyone
1231480	1237480	from all the debilitating problems that they have allowed to fall upon this once great website.
1237480	1240480	Well, I'm here to say that enough is enough.
1240480	1243480	YouTube wasn't built by Hollywood celebrities.
1243480	1245480	YouTube was built by the people.
1245480	1247480	YouTube was built by us.
1247480	1253480	And I'm not gonna stand by for another year while all these fake smiling Hollywood people
1254480	1258480	party it up on the penthouse of the empire that we built.
1258480	1262480	So if you're like me and you want to see some actual positive change around here,
1262480	1266480	then join me in pressing dislike on this year's YouTube Rewind.
1266480	1270480	YouTube is going to demonetize and censor this video.
1270480	1276480	So I encourage you all to share this video, download this video, and repost this video far and wide.
1276480	1282480	I encourage you all to share this video with other YouTubers that YouTube has screwed over this year
1282480	1284480	and get them on board too.
1284480	1289480	It's time for us, the real YouTubers, to stick up for ourselves.
1289480	1292480	It's time to tank the rewind.
