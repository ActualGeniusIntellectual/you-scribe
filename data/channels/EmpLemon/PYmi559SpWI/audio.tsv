0	2800	What is the point of making movies?
2800	5040	There are many answers to this question,
5040	7840	ranging from the creative to the persuasive.
7840	9280	But in this day and age,
9280	14480	the motivations of the film industry at large come down to something far more cynical.
14480	19120	The truth is that the average movie only sees the light of day for one reason.
19120	21760	Another five-letter word that starts with M.
24640	27440	Uh-oh, looks like we just ran out of funding.
28000	31760	Well, I guess we better queue up some coming attractions.
38960	40880	Do you remember Opera?
40880	43520	What, that web browser we used to use as kids?
43520	44080	They're back.
47600	50480	Check it out, they got this new integrated AI called ARIA.
50480	54960	It's so smart, I can physically feel my IQ rising by using this thing!
54960	57920	ARIA, give me tomorrow's lottery numbers.
59120	61920	One browser is more secure than the rest.
63440	65680	I don't know, he locked himself in his room.
65680	68560	Kind of like how Opera locks down their users' privacy.
68560	71440	One browser is more lucid than the rest.
71440	74080	Looks like they added this thing called Lucid Mode.
74080	78880	It makes digital experiences more lifelike, almost as if they're real.
79440	81840	One browser will reign supreme.
81840	84320	I'm starting to get concerned about Rusty.
84320	86480	He hasn't left his house in three days,
86480	91280	and the last thing he mentioned to me was something about becoming one with Opera.
91280	92320	This winter...
92320	94480	Open the studio doors, ARIA.
94480	95760	It ain't over.
95760	97600	I'm hiding in the woods right now.
97600	99120	It's the only place it can't get me.
99680	100480	Oh my god.
101760	102400	What is that?
103040	104880	To the Virtual Lady Sings.
105520	106800	What is happening?
106800	109120	They put me in the computer!
109120	110000	Starring...
110000	116000	Built-in VPN, ad blocker, sidebar music player, and inorganizable tabs.
117120	119760	At last, I have found her.
120960	122880	Introducing Opera.
123440	125440	Coming soon to you.

129760	135120	It's easy to get carried away by the stardom and spectacle that Hollywood blockbusters provide,
135120	136800	but make no mistake about it.
136800	140160	These things exist to serve a very specific purpose.
140160	144240	No different from that of a McDonald's cheeseburger or a can of Coke.
144240	148400	The vast majority of movies are designed to be consumer products.
148400	152400	They are a tool used by corporations to generate profit.
152400	157360	The most fundamental aspect of business is being able to make more than you spend.
157360	160080	And before a single frame of film is shot,
160080	165760	its investors must have confidence that whatever their funding is an asset and not a liability.
165760	168960	Despite fulfilling the same general economic function,
168960	173840	the way in which films make their money is unique to most other consumer goods.
173840	177360	A single successful movie is potentially more valuable than
177360	180800	selling 10,000 cars or 10 million sandwiches.
180800	183920	With so much revenue tied up in just one product,
183920	188160	it completely changes the way in which producers have to approach risk.
188160	192880	The dreaded box office bomb can be as destructive as its name suggests.
192880	195680	The industry's biggest flops have ruined careers,
195680	200880	bankrupted companies and have even led to the extinction of entire genres of storytelling.
200880	204320	Most Hollywood studios hesitate to swing for the fences
204320	207760	because the risk of striking out is often catastrophic.
207760	211920	Keeping the playbook safe and predictable is usually what's best for business,
211920	215200	even if it comes at the cost of artistic integrity.
215200	220320	There's no need to reinvent the wheel when the formula for success is already set in stone.
220960	225600	The highest grossing films in history tend to have a few things in common.
225600	231440	As it turns out, 2023 has seen not one but two new entries to the coveted list.
231440	236320	The Mario movie featuring the most recognizable video game mascot of all time
236320	241200	and the Barbie movie featuring the most recognizable toy mascot of all time.
241200	246480	When you add in Harry Potter, the most recognizable literary mascot of the 21st century,
246480	248720	you may start to notice a pattern.
248720	252320	The most profitable films don't tend to be very original.
252320	255200	While it's somewhat amusing to see adaptations
255200	259200	reproduce their source material with varying degrees of faithfulness,
259200	261760	it's tough to ignore that most of the heavy lifting
261760	265360	to establish these brands had already been done long ago.
265360	268720	In general, audiences are drawn to what's familiar.
268720	272160	This logic applies to adaptations as well as sequels,
272160	275840	which over time have become even bigger cash cows.
275840	282160	The original Top Gun is not among the top 20 highest earners, but the 2022 sequel is.
282160	285680	The same is true for Jurassic Park, Fast and the Furious,
285680	289840	and even the uncanny live-action Lion King reboot which nobody likes
289840	292240	but everyone paid to go see apparently.
292240	296320	Of course, Disney are the kings of getting value out of their properties.
296320	301200	They were the first studio to embrace the newest money-making strategy in Hollywood.
301200	305520	String together enough sequels and spin-offs and you get a cinematic universe
305520	308960	where each release induces demand on the others.
308960	313840	And with that, we've pretty much filled out the whole list, except for the very top.
316960	322480	As of 2023, the highest grossing film of all time is James Cameron's Avatar,
322480	327760	which reclaimed the number one spot from the Avengers after its re-release last year.
327760	333280	In fact, Cameron was in the director's seat for three of the top five box office milestones
333280	336880	For a list otherwise dominated by recycled concepts,
336880	342160	Avatar was unique in being a totally new experience when it debuted in theaters.
342160	348480	Business-wise, it was by far the most ambitious, spanning 15 years from concept to execution
348480	352560	and making the absolute most of the technology at its disposal.
352560	356480	Sometimes a little risk is necessary to earn the greatest reward.
358320	362560	So far, Avatar has grossed just under three billion dollars,
362560	365680	with an official budget of 237 million.
365680	368880	It produced returns of about 12 to 1,
368880	373680	meaning that if for whatever reason you had invested a hundred dollars into the project,
373680	376400	you would have gotten back about 1200.
376400	380080	Here we find a different way of looking at a movie's profitability.
380080	383200	While Avatar made the most total money of any film,
383200	386320	it was far from the highest return on investment.
386320	390320	Exploring the top of this metric puts us in an entirely different ballgame.
393440	401040	For years, the biggest profit margin in cinema was attributed to the 1972 pornographic film Deep Throat.
401040	407840	On just a $47,000 budget, the project at one point reported earnings of up to 600 million,
407840	412320	which would have put it in the same league as Star Wars in terms of ticket sales.
412320	417200	However, historical consensus has shed serious doubt on this claim.
417200	422480	It turns out that the movie was distributed primarily through mafia-controlled theaters.
422480	427760	Meaning that its revenue was more than likely propped up by various other streams of income.
428400	432000	Experts now estimate that the film made just 50 million,
432000	435840	which still equates to an impressive return of a thousand to one.
436560	438720	As for more conventional films,
438720	443520	the rest of the 70s marked a golden age for hyper-profitable projects.
443520	449360	Rocky turned a budget of a million dollars into a 225 million dollar box office.
449360	453360	The original Mad Max earned 100 million off 400,000.
453360	458800	Bruce Lee's Way of the Dragon made 130 million off just 130,000.
458800	464960	But out of all the low-budget heroes, by far the greatest number could be found in the horror genre.
464960	469200	The remarkable success of films like Halloween, Friday the 13th,
469200	474560	and Texas Chainsaw Massacre cemented horror as the format to do more with less.
474560	479680	And starting in 1993, a pair of students from the University of Central Florida
479680	482640	hashed a plan to make the next sleeper hit.
482640	486560	An endeavor that would eventually be known as the Blair Witch Project.
492080	496960	It's the story of three amateur filmmakers investigating a local superstition in the
496960	503600	Maryland wilderness. After venturing too far off course, their situation rapidly deteriorates.
503600	508000	Before long, it's clear that they've stumbled into unwelcome territory.
508000	512800	Miles away from civilization, they make the disturbing discovery that they're not alone
512800	519360	in the woods. These days, Blair Witch is known as one of the defining horror sensations of its time.
519360	522800	Far less known, however, are the incredible lengths its creators
522800	526160	went through to keep its production as inexpensive as possible.
527040	532080	When making a movie, there are three extenuating variables that will tend to eat up most of your
532080	538400	budget. The first and most obvious is manpower. Every aspect of production, from lighting to
538400	544080	wardrobe to set design, often requires its own specialized team of artists and technicians.
544080	549440	It's not uncommon for even small-scale projects to require a headcount in the hundreds.
549440	554240	As filming drags on, all those names in the credits quickly drive up the bill.
554240	558880	And if that wasn't enough, every one of those people are probably working with some kind of
558880	564800	expensive technology that also has to be factored into the budget. Modern films are expected to
564800	570960	look a certain way and adhere to strict standards of technical proficiency. If the pictures, sound,
570960	576080	or special effects come off as too sloppy, the audience may end up dismissing the project
576080	582320	entirely. Therefore, respectable films practically need sophisticated equipment before they can be
582320	587600	taken seriously, which doesn't come cheap. But even if a movie meets all the technical
587600	593440	specifications, audiences can still end up rejecting it when the creative aspects fall flat.
593440	600000	It's easy to scoff at how much money A-list actors rake in, but as is the case with any industry,
600000	606080	the best of the best tend to come at a premium. If you want a job done well, you need to invest
606080	611200	in high-end talent. Altogether, these are the most inescapable roadblocks to any film's
611200	617120	profitability. A production can consider itself lucky if it can manage to dodge just one of them.
617120	623120	Remarkably, Blair Witch figured out a way to circumvent all three. To accomplish this,
623120	629200	they would tap into the dark arts of found footage. The technique can be traced back to
629200	634560	the infamous Italian horror film Cannibal Holocaust. It's a film that's been used for
635520	640960	It presents an unorthodox method of storytelling in which the events of the plot are shot by the
640960	647120	on-screen characters. For years, the style was mostly limited to niche experimental films,
647120	652400	but Blair Witch would be the first to utilize it in a strategic way. Because when it comes
652400	658800	to profitability, found footage is a cinematic cheat code. When Merrick and Sanchez began the
658800	665760	casting process in 1996, they were only interested in two criteria, improvisational skill
665760	671120	and basic experience with operating cameras. Eventually, they narrowed down their search to
671120	676400	three candidates, Heather Donohue, Michael Williams, and Joshua Leonard. The trio were
676400	682320	given a rather unique responsibility. They weren't just the stars of the show. They were basically in
682320	687520	charge of creating everything we saw on screen. During principal photography, pretty much the
687520	693040	only manpower working on the film were these three people. In fact, the directors were not
693040	698160	even present while most of the filming took place. While working under no supervision,
698160	704560	the actors' performances were entirely spontaneous. The script for the project contained no dialogue,
704560	710160	as every conversation was intended to be improvised on the spot. Giving the actors so much
710160	715520	liberty over the production process drastically cut down on labor costs, but where the found
715520	721600	footage method really shines is its flexibility with inexpensive equipment. The very premise of
721600	727920	the genre provides a diegetic excuse for a lo-fi presentation. The picture quality can look
727920	733520	unprofessional because that's how the characters within the story shot it. Most of Blair Witch was
733520	740880	filmed on a Hi8 camcorder, which retailed for only $300 at the time. Although it was far below the
740880	746800	standard expected from feature films, it works within the specific context of found footage.
747600	753120	With the cost of labor and equipment now taken care of, the filmmakers had only one problem left
753120	758800	to worry about. They had to elicit convincing performances out of the inexperienced cast.
758800	764080	For such a low-budget project, they could only really draw from a pool of unknowns. With the
764080	770080	skill of the actors being a major question mark, the directors came up with an ingenious solution.
770080	775440	While there were no guarantees that the cast would bring realism to the film, the film could
775440	781120	bring realism to the cast. During most of the shoot, the actors were placed in the same environment
781120	786720	that their characters were intended to experience. To simulate the real impression of being alone in
786720	792240	the woods, the filmmakers decided to limit their interactions with the cast as much as possible.
792240	796800	Most of the communication was done through written directions that were placed at pre-arranged
796800	802560	locations in the woods. The actors were often instructed to traverse long distances in real
802560	808160	time, which led to actual instances of them getting lost. Furthermore, the actors were not
808160	813600	informed of upcoming plot points. Many of the most pivotal scenes truly showed them reacting to
813600	818880	unnerving events for the first time. Needless to say, several straight days of sleeping in the
818880	824160	woods and getting legitimately spooked by the directors left the cast quite exhausted. By the
824160	829280	end of it all, they really were desperate to return home. While it was far from the most
829280	834560	comfortable experience, the strategy certainly made the performances more convincing. And with
834560	839040	that, pretty much all the footage that would appear in the final product was complete.
839040	845760	At this point, the total budget was estimated to be less than $25,000. In the following months,
845760	851280	the directors gradually whittled down 20 hours of raw footage into the 81-minute final cut.
851840	855040	After more than five years since its initial conception,
855040	859520	The Blair Witch Project was finished. Now all it needed was an audience.
862960	868800	In the film industry, making the movie itself is only half the battle. Before any production
868800	874160	can turn a profit, people need to have a reason to go see it. Throughout the history of cinema,
874160	878480	there are countless examples of excellent products that ultimately flopped because of
878480	883280	poor marketing. It's a process made even more challenging with a limited budget,
883280	889600	as conventional venues for advertising become inaccessible. Without backing from major studios,
889600	894240	independent films often have to rely on guerrilla tactics to generate interest,
894240	898640	and Blair Witch was no different. While approaching the marketing problem,
898640	902640	the filmmakers would stumble upon their greatest stroke of genius yet.
903200	908880	Ordinarily, a sluggish production is not ideal, but in the case of Blair Witch, it happened to
908880	914800	work precisely in their favor. The film's lengthy development time allowed its release to coincide
914800	920160	perfectly with the rise of the internet, and as luck would have it, this radical grassroots
920160	925520	project would be the first to harness its true power. In earlier drafts of the film,
925520	930640	the directors had planned to present the story through a pseudo-documentary format.
930640	935680	The angle was eventually scrapped for pacing reasons, but the documentary segments would
935680	941760	find far greater use elsewhere. They ended up being repurposed and reformatted for television.
941760	946560	More than a year ahead of its release, the myth of the Blair Witch would be quietly introduced
946560	952240	over the American airwaves. The promotional material would appear just twice, first as a
952240	957360	10-minute segment on the Bravo series split screen, then as an hour-long standalone special
957360	963200	on the sci-fi network. While the spotlight was short-lived, it was still incredibly effective.
963200	968960	Overnight, the filmmakers had succeeded in turning the fictional Blair Witch into a real-life urban
968960	974880	legend. At a time when rumors ran wild on online message boards, the premise of the film became the
974880	980560	subject of intense speculation. The American public had no concept of found footage at this
980560	986160	point, leading many to believe that the events of the documentaries were real. The scale of the
986160	992160	campaign became clear when the film opened its own website and received 160 million visitors,
992160	996960	the majority of which truly believed they had uncovered an actual missing persons case.
997680	1002880	Out of basically nothing, the filmmakers had transformed a totally unknown brand into one of
1002880	1008800	the most highly anticipated prospects in cinema. Following its premiere at Sundance, the Blair Witch
1008800	1015520	project was immediately picked up for theatrical release. In August of 1999, the film would play in
1015600	1020800	thousands of theaters around the nation and many more around the world. By the end of its run,
1020800	1026480	Blair Witch had grossed just shy of a quarter billion dollars. Off of an official budget of
1026480	1035360	just 60,000, it produced an astounding return of 4,144 to one. If you had invested a hundred
1035360	1041040	dollars into this movie, it would have paid out the value of a new house. Upon release,
1041040	1045600	The Blair Witch Project was by far the most profitable film ever made.
1046640	1052240	Up until now, we've only discussed the business end of filmmaking, but the true value of movies
1052240	1057520	extends far beyond the balance sheet. The history of Hollywood has seen no shortage of shameless
1057520	1063040	cash grabs, mediocre junk that everyone forgets about as soon as they walk out of the theater.
1063040	1068080	The films we end up remembering do more than just make money. Perhaps the most surprising
1068080	1073280	thing about the most profitable film in cinema is that it was actually good. Oddly enough,
1073280	1078800	there is very little fanfare surrounding Blair Witch today and it rarely comes up in discussions
1078800	1084240	of the most iconic horror films. This is probably due to the split reception it received from
1084240	1090320	audiences at the time. After more than a year of intense hype, many viewers found the final product
1090320	1095440	underwhelming. Much of the disappointment stemmed from the simple realization that the events of the
1095440	1100720	film weren't actually real. While this led much of the general public to dismiss its merit,
1100720	1106240	critics saw things differently. In a time of stagnation for the horror genre, Blair Witch
1106240	1111600	represented something truly new. The handheld amateur camera work provided a more intimate
1111600	1117200	sense of immersion that felt unique and refreshing. The film makes great use of tension, gradually
1117200	1122400	escalating the conflict without ever revealing too much. Throughout the story, the true nature
1122400	1127440	of the Blair Witch is kept ambiguous. When presented with the possibility of changing the
1127440	1133040	film's final scene, the directors ultimately decided to keep what they had shot originally,
1133040	1138880	the ending that left the audience with the most room for interpretation. This open-ended mystique
1138880	1144000	has allowed the film to age gracefully. To this day, there's still a debate over whether the
1144000	1150240	characters truly experienced anything supernatural. Perhaps this movie's greatest success is making us
1150240	1156160	realize how frightening it can be to simply let our imaginations run wild. I think the late Roger
1156160	1162160	Ebert put it best in his review of the film. At a time when digital techniques can show us almost
1162160	1167520	anything, the Blair Witch project is a reminder that what really scares us is the stuff we can't
1167520	1173600	see. But as for the movie's overall legacy, the only thing most people did see was its eye-popping
1173600	1179440	financial success. Naturally, it was bound to spawn some imitators, and in the following years,
1179440	1185360	the found-footage genre briefly became Hollywood's newest gold rush. Out of these new challengers,
1185360	1191840	the most successful were J.J. Abrams' Cloverfield and the Paranormal Activity franchise. In fact,
1191840	1197040	depending on how you factor in post-production costs, the original Paranormal Activity has
1197040	1202640	a claim to the title of the most profitable film. But the way I see it, it's hard not to respect
1202640	1208640	what came before. Thus far, no other film has really topped Blair Witch as the defining piece
1208640	1214400	of the genre. You can chalk up its success to a perfect storm of events, how it benefited from
1214400	1219680	a series of extremely lucky breaks that will never be replicated. But at the end of the day, when you
1219680	1225280	look beyond the pomp and circumstance, the Blair Witch project deserves to stand on its own as a
1225280	1235200	good product. Even now, 25 years later, it still has a lot to teach us. Despite a few home runs,
1235200	1241120	2023 has been one of the most unprofitable years for Hollywood. And while many are quick to blame
1241120	1247040	the actors and writers' strike for this, it doesn't really tell the whole story. For many years now,
1247040	1252080	the industry's tried and true money-making formulas have been backfiring. It appears that
1252080	1258160	the days of simply pumping out recognizable IPs might be over. Modern cinema has found itself at
1258160	1263520	a crossroads where not even Disney can seem to figure out what to do anymore. Somewhere along
1263520	1269360	the way, the business end of filmmaking got too optimized for its own good. Throughout Hollywood's
1269360	1275120	obsession of making movies more profitable, they forgot how to make them valuable. If you really
1275120	1280160	think about it, having people pay to watch a bunch of imaginary moving pictures is a pretty
1280160	1285680	nonsensical business model. If it's money you're after, you'd be far better off selling drugs,
1285680	1291440	drilling oil, or defrauding investors. After a while, movies have to be more than yet another
1291440	1296880	means to an end. Cinema was built off the backs of the gunslingers, the risk takers,
1296880	1301840	the visionaries who showed the rest of the world what no one else could see. The greatest
1301840	1306880	filmmakers are defined not by the money they produce, but the magic they create using what
1306880	1312480	little they have to work with. If Hollywood wants to turn things around, they're gonna have to learn
1312480	1318720	how to be more resourceful. The way things are headed now, they might be left with no other choice.
1318720	1322720	The future of cinema may be uncertain, but if there's one silver lining,
1322720	1327120	it's that the hardest times often lead to the greatest inspiration.
