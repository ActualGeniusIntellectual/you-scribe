1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,560
Always remember, if you ain't first, you're last.

2
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:07,680
Columbus, Washington, Armstrong.

3
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:12,400
To most, these names are remembered for one reason and one reason only.

4
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:16,240
They were each the first to accomplish something remarkable.

5
00:00:16,240 --> 00:00:21,360
The word first is one of the most frequently used adjectives in the English language.

6
00:00:21,360 --> 00:00:26,480
Out of all descriptive concepts, first may be the most important superlative.

7
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:30,240
Words we use to express the highest degree of something.

8
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:34,880
First is one of the most popular superlatives because it's so unambiguous.

9
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:38,160
Being the first person to do anything is a big deal.

10
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:42,000
All who follow you have no choice but to know your name.

11
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,800
If you're the first to achieve something monumental,

12
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:48,400
history will remember you long after you're gone.

13
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:51,600
Most superlatives end with the suffix est,

14
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:56,480
a grammatical trait rather fittingly shared by the tallest mountain on the planet.

15
00:00:56,480 --> 00:01:00,560
Mount Everest is quite possibly the world's most famous landform.

16
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:03,760
It towers nearly nine kilometers above sea level

17
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:07,280
and can be seen from over 300 kilometers away,

18
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:10,560
equivalent to seeing New York City from Boston.

19
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:14,240
It's a well-known fact that the first person to reach the summit of Everest

20
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:17,120
was Sir Edmund Hillary in 1953.

21
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:20,400
It's one of those pieces of trivia that gets thrown around so much

22
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:22,480
that you just stop questioning it.

23
00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:25,440
It seems like something that should be indisputable.

24
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:29,040
The first man to set foot atop the tallest mountain.

25
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:32,000
An unambiguous statement of fact.

26
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:36,960
Except, 29 years before Edmund Hillary reached the top of Everest,

27
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:40,240
there's a small chance, but a chance nonetheless,

28
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:47,840
that someone else may have got there first.

29
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:52,400
The western world first laid eyes on Everest in the middle of the 19th century,

30
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:56,240
but it wasn't until 1921 when they first set foot on it.

31
00:01:56,240 --> 00:02:00,640
That year, the British Royal Geographic Society financed the first expedition

32
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:03,440
to explore Everest and identify a route to the top.

33
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:08,240
A leading member of the expedition was 34-year-old George Mallory,

34
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:11,520
considered to be one of the most skilled climbers in Britain.

35
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:15,680
Just five years prior, Mallory was fighting in the Battle of the Somme,

36
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:17,760
where over the span of five months,

37
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:21,920
the young men of Europe suffered more than 1.6 million casualties.

38
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:27,280
In 1922, Mallory was about to enter one of the few places on Earth

39
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:29,200
that was even more inhospitable.

40
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:32,480
For millennia, civilizations around the world

41
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:35,440
have considered the highest mountains to be sacred grounds.

42
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:39,840
Anyone who dared to climb them would be trespassing in the realm of gods.

43
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:42,880
No matter how superstitious you are,

44
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:45,360
you can't deny that there are some places on Earth

45
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:47,680
that human beings were never designed to go.

46
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:51,760
Atop mountains like Everest, the terrain is so precarious

47
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:54,720
that one misstep can result in a fatal fall.

48
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:59,280
For most of the year, the summit is blasted with hurricane-force winds,

49
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:01,760
enough to blow any climber clear off the mountain.

50
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:05,600
Any practical attempts to reach the summit have to be conducted

51
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:09,120
in roughly a 10-day window before the annual monsoon season,

52
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:11,200
when wind speeds are relatively calm.

53
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:15,120
Usually this window opens towards the end of May,

54
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:20,080
but even then, temperatures at the top of Everest struggle to break zero degrees,

55
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:23,360
cold enough to cause frostbite on exposed skin in minutes.

56
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:28,000
The frigid temperatures force climbers to seek shelter by nightfall,

57
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:32,160
but even the welcome warmth of the sun presents its own challenges during the day.

58
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:37,200
Ultraviolet radiation becomes much more potent at high altitudes.

59
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:39,600
Combined with highly reflective snow,

60
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:42,640
people on Everest are at constant risk of snow blindness

61
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:44,480
and other debilitating eye problems.

62
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:49,040
Even during optimal weather, conditions can change in an instant.

63
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:52,000
Climbers can venture onto the Everest slopes on a clear day

64
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:56,560
and suddenly find themselves stranded in blizzard conditions with nowhere to hide.

65
00:03:56,560 --> 00:04:00,080
As if that wasn't bad enough, the roving threat of an avalanche

66
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:03,280
can wipe out an entire team of climbers in a matter of seconds.

67
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:08,800
However, in spite of all the deadly hazards that await climbers at the top of Everest,

68
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:12,720
the single most life-threatening factor has to do with what isn't there.

69
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:18,560
At 29,000 feet, air pressure is three times lower than at sea level,

70
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:22,880
meaning that climbers have access to only one-third as much oxygen.

71
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:27,840
Mount Everest is one of 14 summits that extends above the 8,000 meter mark,

72
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:30,320
otherwise known as the Death Zone.

73
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:35,680
Beyond this altitude, the human body no longer has enough oxygen to sustain itself,

74
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:39,520
and within several hours, vital systems will begin to shut down.

75
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:44,000
Climbers who enter this range are no longer flirting with death.

76
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,320
They are literally in the process of dying.

77
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:51,680
If anyone in the Death Zone fails to descend back to a safe altitude in time,

78
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:53,840
their chances of survival are zero.

79
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:58,320
The Death Zone presents an extreme complication by making any run

80
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:01,440
towards the Everest summit a crucially time-sensitive event.

81
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:07,040
Climbers must maintain a certain pace on the final ascent or else risk running out of oxygen.

82
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:10,000
To make matters even more difficult,

83
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,600
the thin atmosphere makes the act of climbing painstakingly slow.

84
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:19,520
Most climbers near the summit have to stop to catch their breath after each individual step.

85
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:25,520
The process is so exhaustive that summiters are expected to burn more than 15,000 calories,

86
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:28,560
equivalent to the daily energy output of seven people.

87
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:32,480
The peak of Mount Everest is in contention for the single most

88
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:35,120
hazardous place on the surface of the Earth,

89
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:40,080
and 99 years ago, George Mallory was one of six climbers trying to get there.

90
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:46,000
On May 19, 1922, Mallory led Howard Somerville, Edward Norton,

91
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:49,840
and Henry Moreshead on the first official attempt to reach the Everest summit.

92
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:54,400
Across three days, the team trekked up the north side of the mountain,

93
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:59,680
eventually reaching a record altitude of 8,225 meters before turning back.

94
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:05,280
On May 24, George Finch and Jeffrey Bruce set off on another attempt,

95
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:07,840
this time making use of supplemental oxygen.

96
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:14,400
On the 27th, Finch reached a new altitude record of 8,326 meters.

97
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:18,320
Immediately, Mallory was eager to make his own attempt with oxygen,

98
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:20,960
believing that it was his ticket to making history.

99
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:25,440
While many of the exhausted climbers were hesitant to make a third attempt,

100
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,920
Mallory's fascination with Everest had begun to turn into an obsession.

101
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:36,240
On June 3, he convinced several climbers to follow him on a hastily improvised trek to the summit.

102
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:42,240
They were joined by 14 Sherpa porters who were assisting and hauling equipment to the higher camps.

103
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:45,600
The expedition was now running far too late,

104
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:49,360
and the monsoon had begun dumping fresh snow on the Everest slopes.

105
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:55,200
On June 7, Mallory's party triggered an avalanche that buried seven porters alive.

106
00:06:55,760 --> 00:06:59,440
The disaster would mark the immediate end of the expedition.

107
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:03,040
Mallory was criticized by his peers for his recklessness,

108
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:07,200
as his sudden mania for the summit had led to a severe lapse in judgment.

109
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:10,400
After the failure of 1922,

110
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:14,480
he would have to wait two more years until his next chance to conquer Everest.

111
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:20,560
In the spring of 1924, the British expedition crew were back in the Himalayas.

112
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:25,360
Mallory, Bruce, Norton, and Somerville had returned from the previous mission,

113
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:29,920
this time being joined by newcomers Noel O'Dell and Sandy Ervin.

114
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:32,640
Mallory was now 37,

115
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:37,920
and reconciled that this expedition would likely be his last shot at reaching the world's highest peak.

116
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:43,520
The May of 1924 featured historically poor weather conditions at Everest.

117
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:46,720
Not wanting a repeat of the 1922 disaster,

118
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:52,320
the group decided to overrule Mallory's original plan and attempt the summit without oxygen.

119
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:57,440
The change frustrated Mallory, who now viewed oxygen as a necessity to reach the summit.

120
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:02,720
On June 1, Mallory and Bruce began their journey up the North Ridge.

121
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:03,920
After less than a day,

122
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:08,720
the pair disappointingly aborted their attempt after poor weather forced them to retreat.

123
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:12,960
On June 2, Norton and Somerville began their attempt,

124
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:17,440
this time finding themselves in ideal weather as they marched higher up the mountain.

125
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:21,200
By June 4, the pair had made it all the way up to the Great Cold War

126
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:25,360
before exhaustion and respiratory problems forced them to turn around.

127
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:32,960
Edward Norton reached a new altitude record of 8,570 meters, just 280 meters beneath the summit.

128
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:39,040
Mallory was originally scheduled to make one last attempt with experienced climber Noel O'Dell,

129
00:08:39,040 --> 00:08:43,680
but after the failed first attempt, Mallory decided to call an audible.

130
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:49,120
Instead of O'Dell, Mallory would make his final run to the summit alongside the 22-year-old novice

131
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:54,320
Sandy Ervin, who happened to be the most skilled oxygen technician among the expedition crew.

132
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:58,160
Based on this attribute, it's clear what Mallory had in mind.

133
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:02,320
On June 6, Mallory and Ervin began their ascent,

134
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:06,160
each bringing with them as much oxygen as they could afford to carry.

135
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:11,280
The pair were trailed by O'Dell, who was taking photos about a thousand meters farther down the

136
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:17,200
slope. On the evening of the 7th, Mallory wrote a final correspondence to O'Dell before the run to

137
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:21,760
the summit, saying to look out for he and Ervin near the summit skyline the next day.

138
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:28,000
On the morning of June 8, O'Dell eagerly waited for visual confirmation of the climbers,

139
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:31,040
but Everest's peak for the moment was obscured by mist.

140
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:35,760
Then, at 1250 p.m., there was a sudden break in the cloud cover,

141
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:41,520
allowing O'Dell to clearly see the summit. There, O'Dell witnessed two black dots scaling one of

142
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:47,200
the rock steps on the northeast ridge, with one dot appearing to climb up and over the crest,

143
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:52,560
just below the final summit pyramid. After five minutes, the mist rolled back in,

144
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:58,400
and the two figures disappeared behind the clouds. This small, fleeting moment would be the last time

145
00:09:58,400 --> 00:10:04,080
that George Mallory and Sandy Ervin were ever seen alive. Shortly after the sighting, a storm

146
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:10,000
hit the mountain, and the two climbers did not return from their attempt. O'Dell, as the closest

147
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:16,560
party member, hiked up to around 8,200 meters to search for them, but after 24 hours, he signaled

148
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:22,160
the rest of the crew that no trace could be found. Mallory and Ervin had been lost to the mountain.

149
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:28,160
The tragedy would soon be overshadowed by the burning question looming in everyone's mind.

150
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:32,080
The two climbers were on the cusp of the single greatest achievement in the history

151
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:35,920
of human exploration, and no one in the world knew if they had made it.

152

choose to swap it out or skip the month entirely for no charge. So for this expedition, the folks

162
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:52,480
at Bespoke have provided us with the trail box and the weekender bag, and actually it

163
00:11:52,480 --> 00:12:01,440
looks like we're coming up on the mountain right about now. Man, that's a little bit bigger than

164
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:07,600
what I was expecting. All right, I guess they did sponsor us to come out here, so

165
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:16,400
gotta go climb it. All right, here we go. This is what dreams are made of right here.

166
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:24,080
History in the making. Seeing that enormous mountain in front of me had me worried,

167
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:29,440
but thankfully the Bespoke trail box had everything I needed to tackle the tough road ahead.

168
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:34,480
The survival manual, pocket saw, and paracord bracelet should allow us to navigate this

169
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:40,320
potentially deadly situation, and the gut hook knife will provide us with much needed leverage

170
00:12:40,640 --> 00:12:46,160
on these treacherous slopes. Just starting to get at the incline here.

171
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:55,360
Still quite a ways to go, but if we keep up this fast enough vertical pace,

172
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:59,520
we should be able to reach the summit by sundown.

173
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:08,800
I was starting to get exhausted from ordering my Sherpa to carry the supplies up the mountain.

174
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:13,760
Luckily the Bespoke weekender bag and nylon shoulder strap attachment allowed us to set

175
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:21,280
up base camp right on schedule. Just a few more hours we can get there, but for now we must stop

176
00:13:21,280 --> 00:13:28,960
and acclimatize to the sheer altitude difference. Luckily the cozy interior of the weekender travel

177
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:33,600
bag has uh kept our provisions nice and warm.

178
00:13:37,280 --> 00:13:40,720
I can tell you what it tastes, it tastes like history.

179
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:45,840
All right we've reached a high enough altitude on the mountain

180
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:49,200
where we're now required to activate our oxygen systems.

181
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:54,640
All right fellas, I'll see you at the top of the mountain.

182
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:10,960
We did it! I did it! I have become the first green man to climb the tallest mountain in Florida,

183
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:19,840
and wow just look at that view. Oh this is just unbelievable, you must be 10, 15 feet up in the

184
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:26,160
air. You sure did it Mr. Lemon and you did it all by yourself, you're a real hero. Well that's not

185
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:33,440
true Sherpa Cage, I couldn't have done it without Bespoke Post. I'd like to dedicate this moment

186
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:37,360
to all the people who watch my videos and consume the products.

187
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:54,480
Following the 1924 Everest expedition, reporters were eager to find out whether the highest peak

188
00:14:54,480 --> 00:15:00,320
in the world had been reached. As the last people to see Mallory and Irvin alive, the other members

189
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:06,320
of the expedition found themselves in a frenzy of media attention. Fellow climbers Odell, Norton,

190
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:11,440
and Somerville were under the consensus that the pair had reached the summit. However, the greater

191
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:16,880
climbing community were far more skeptical and future Everest expeditions would begin to raise

192
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:22,240
major questions over the possibility of a successful attempt. Based on the testimony from

193
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:27,280
Norton and Odell, the working theory was that Mallory and Irvin were attempting to reach the

194
00:15:27,280 --> 00:15:33,040
summit via the crest of the northeast ridge, a route which at that point had never been explored.

195
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:38,480
Climbers of the time lacked the knowledge or experience to truly evaluate the difficulty of

196
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:43,920
the route. A major complication that Mallory and Irvin would have had to face was a geological

197
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:49,840
feature on the ridge known as the second step, one of three prominent obstacles on the final run to

198
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:56,880
the summit. At an altitude of 8600 meters, the second step is a 40 meter tall near vertical rock

199
00:15:56,880 --> 00:16:02,480
face that spans across the entire width of the ridge. Initially it was claimed to be the rock

200
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:08,160
step mentioned in Odell's eyewitness report and was supposedly surmounted by one of the climbers

201
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:14,160
in just five minutes. However, as future expeditions examined the second step, Odell's

202
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:20,400
statement began to appear more and more dubious. The first climbers to definitively explore the

203
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:26,560
second step arrived in the 1933 expedition. One member described the rock face as utterly

204
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:32,960
impregnable. Edmund Hillary's successful summit attempt in 1953 did not have to navigate the

205
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:38,640
second step as he reached the summit from the south side of the mountain. The first party

206
00:16:38,640 --> 00:16:45,280
confirmed to successfully climb the second step was the 1960 Chinese expedition which managed to

207
00:16:45,280 --> 00:16:50,720
overcome the obstacle using pitons, a climbing aid which Mallory and Irvin did not have.

208
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:57,600
Even with superior tools, it still took the Chinese five excruciating hours to complete the climb.

209
00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:03,360
Future expeditions would install a ladder to make surmounting the second step somewhat bearable.

210
00:17:04,080 --> 00:17:09,680
Historical hindsight of the second step's extreme difficulties shed serious doubt on whether Mallory

211
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:16,320
or Irvin could have feasibly climbed it back in 1924. Irvin, a novice climber, was almost certainly

212
00:17:16,320 --> 00:17:22,000
out of his depth. Only Mallory would have had a realistic chance of navigating the obstacle,

213
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:28,160
but many climbers today question whether even that would have been possible. Modern day mountaineers

214
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:34,000
now use tiered grading scales such as the Yosemite Decimal System to assess the technical difficulty

215
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:40,800
of climbing features. In the centuries since the 1924 expedition, several experts have successfully

216
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:47,520
free climbed the second step and have appraised the obstacle with grades ranging from 5.6 to 5.10.

217
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:54,000
Based on Mallory's climbing history, his skill has been estimated at a grade of 5.9,

218
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:59,440
meaning that the second step may have been just within his capabilities. However, aside from his

219
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:05,360
raw aptitude, Mallory would have also had to scale the step using rudimentary gear while hauling

220
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:11,360
multiple oxygen canisters. Making an unassisted climb on an unexplored obstacle under all these

221
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:16,720
circumstances would have required a superhuman effort, and to do so in the five minutes that

222
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:22,400
Odell supposedly saw, it would have to have been one of the most unlikely miracles in the history

223
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:27,760
of mountain climbing. It's for this reason why many have inferred that Odell did not see the

224
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:33,120
two climbers surmounting the second step, but rather the comparatively easier first step.

225
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:38,960
However, if this was the case, it would have provided the pair with another major complication.

226
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:44,880
At the time Odell spotted the climbers, they were already four hours behind schedule.

227
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:49,600
If they were as far from the summit as the first step in that moment, they would not have had

228
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:55,680
enough time to reach the peak by sundown. Even if Mallory and Irvine had continued climbing into

229
00:18:55,680 --> 00:19:01,920
dusk, their estimated supply of oxygen would have likely run out. An additional problem working

230
00:19:01,920 --> 00:19:06,320
against the two climbers was the rapidly deteriorating weather conditions over the

231
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:12,000
course of June 8th. Meteorological data gathered at the base camp during the expedition recorded

232
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:17,120
a significant drop in barometric pressure between the 8th and 9th, which would have made the air

233
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:22,800
near the summit even more thin. Everest climber Graham Hoyland extrapolated that on the day that

234
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:27,600
Mallory and Irvine trekked to the summit, the drop in air pressure would have added the equivalent of

235
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:33,360
180 meters to the effective altitude of the mountain. Unfortunately, their summit day

236
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:38,640
coincided with the arrival of that season's monsoon, and to get to the summit, the two

237
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:44,480
climbers would have had to survive the storm that hit the mountain at around 2 p.m. A modern-day

238
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:49,120
thermodynamic analysis of Mallory's clothing revealed that he would not have been insulated

239
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:54,560
if the wind speed had risen by a significant degree, a scenario that he likely experienced

240
00:19:54,560 --> 00:20:00,080
in the June 8th storm. It's probable that this sudden change in the weather ultimately led to

241
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:05,040
Mallory and Irvine perishing on the mountain, but for the moment, without any knowledge of

242
00:20:05,040 --> 00:20:11,520
their whereabouts, a specific cause of death could not be determined. Eventually though, as more

243
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:17,120
expeditions ventured up the slopes of Everest, clues began to emerge over the fate of the two

244
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:24,160
wayward climbers. In 1933, crew members discovered a lost ice pick just below the first step.

245
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:30,000
The pick was eventually proven to belong to Sandy Irvine, who likely dropped in near the

246
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:35,200
scene of the climbers fatal accident. Now that an artifact from the missing climbers had been

247
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:40,480
recovered, researchers of the mystery concluded that their final resting place couldn't have been

248
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:46,560
far. Due to the extreme cold near the Everest summit, bodies stranded atop the mountain don't

249
00:20:46,560 --> 00:20:54,560
decompose, allowing them to essentially remain frozen in time. In 1975, Chinese climber Wang

250
00:20:54,560 --> 00:21:00,880
Hung Bao reported spotting a body at an altitude of 8,100 meters. Judging by their clothes, the

251
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:07,200
remains must have belonged to a climber from an old British expedition. 24 years later, several

252
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:13,040
researchers organized a search to locate the deceased climber. It was on that expedition that

253
00:21:13,040 --> 00:21:18,240
Conrad Anker discovered a corpse about 300 meters beneath the site of the lost ice pick.

254
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:26,480
Lying there, face down in the snow was the body of George Mallory. Mallory's remains showed evidence

255
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:32,160
of three key injuries. He suffered a broken leg, a puncture wound in the skull, and bruising from

256
00:21:32,160 --> 00:21:37,840
a rope around his waist. The bruising indicated that Mallory and Irvine were likely roped together

257
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:43,520
when one of them fell, snapping the rope and separating the duo. Mallory's injuries were not

258
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:49,120
severe enough to indicate a steep fall. He may have experienced a minor stumble at the ice axe

259
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:54,400
location, after which he descended further down the slope where he suffered a second fatal fall.

260
00:21:55,200 --> 00:22:00,080
Several of Mallory's possessions were recovered from the scene which revealed additional clues

261
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:06,000
to the summit question. His climbing goggles were found stowed away in a pocket, indicating that he

262
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:11,840
was likely operating in low visibility. Mallory was probably descending after the sun had set

263
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:17,760
or during storm conditions. One of his pockets concealed a note with a list of five oxygen

264
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:22,800
cylinders, providing evidence that the climbers had brought one extra cylinder than previously

265
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:28,160
thought. In fact, the same search mission actually recovered one of these cylinders,

266
00:22:28,160 --> 00:22:32,640
an artifact which marked the highest confirmed point that Mallory and Irvine reached.

267
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:38,560
Rumored to be among Mallory's possessions was a photo of his wife which he planned to place at

268
00:22:38,560 --> 00:22:44,960
the summit. The photo was not found on Mallory's body, sparking further speculation to a successful

269
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:51,360
attempt. But beyond speculation, no evidence could be found that conclusively proved whether he did

270
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:57,360
or did not reach the summit. Many researchers hoped that finding George Mallory would finally

271
00:22:57,360 --> 00:23:02,400
provide a solution to mountaineering's greatest mystery, but it may have only created more

272
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:09,200
questions than answers. Today, nearly 100 years after the tragedy, climbing experts are still

273
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:14,880
split on the fate of Mallory and Irvine. Seasoned veterans like Conrad Anker and Graham Hoyland are

274
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:19,680
of the opinion that they did not make it, reasoning that the duo simply had too many

275
00:23:19,680 --> 00:23:25,680
factors working against them. Other researchers are more optimistic. Philip Summers notes an

276
00:23:25,680 --> 00:23:31,440
inconsistency in the number of sleeping bags accounted for on the 1924 expedition and suggests

277
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:36,480
that Mallory and Irvine may have carried two of them on their summit attempt, possibly as a means

278
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:42,240
of attempting a bivouac to buy them more time. Michael Tracy offers a solution to the second

279
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:47,360
step problem by suggesting that the climbers bypass the obstacle entirely by using the North

280
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:54,080
Ridge traverse, which was the standard route at the time. Tracy presents a comprehensive explanation

281
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:58,720
for how the pair could have followed this route while using a system of oxygen caching to reach

282
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:04,080
the summit before sundown. In this case, Odell would have actually spotted the climbers at the

283
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:10,240
third step, which would be far more consistent with the supposed five-minute climb. There are

284
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:16,160
various other creative theories regarding Mallory and Irvine, but until further evidence surfaces,

285
00:24:16,160 --> 00:24:22,160
a definitive conclusion may never be reached. Fortunately, the mystery is not yet a hopeless

286
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:27,840
cause, as the answer to the summit question may lie among the still undiscovered remains of Sandy

287
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:33,040
Irvine. It's highly likely that if either of the two climbers reached the summit, they would have

288
00:24:33,040 --> 00:24:38,720
collected rock samples. The rocks found atop Everest are geologically unique to that part of

289
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:43,680
the mountain. If Irvine were to be found with summit rocks, it would prove that one of the

290
00:24:43,680 --> 00:24:49,600
climbers had made it to the top of Everest. Curiously, the 1999 forensic search of Mallory's

291
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:55,040
body neglected to check for summit rocks, so it remains unclear whether Mallory had any on his

292
00:24:55,040 --> 00:25:00,640
person. At the time, the prospect of rock samples had been completely overshadowed by the single

293
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:07,040
most compelling missing piece from the 1924 expedition. As Mallory passed Howard Somerville

294
00:25:07,040 --> 00:25:12,240
on his final trek up the mountain, he asked to borrow Somerville's portable Kodak camera to

295
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:18,960
capture photographs in the event of a successful attempt. When Mallory was found in 1999, the camera

296
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:24,240
was not found among his possessions. Therefore, it is likely that Mallory handed off the camera

297
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:30,480
to Irvine sometime during their descent. If the camera is ever located, the undeveloped film within

298
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:36,000
could finally solve the mystery once and for all. Modern-day photographers have shown it's possible

299
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:41,680
to develop hundred-year-old film. It's unknown whether the extreme conditions atop Everest would

300
00:25:41,680 --> 00:25:47,680
corrupt the process, but in the event that the camera is found, Kodak provided special instructions

301
00:25:47,680 --> 00:25:53,920
to give the film its best chance at survival. But before any images can be retrieved, researchers

302
00:25:53,920 --> 00:26:00,400
will most likely have to locate the body of Sandy Irvine first. Xu Jing of the 1960 Chinese

303
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:05,440
expedition claimed to have seen a dead climber lying on his back near the first step. Many

304
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:10,480
researchers have inferred that this must have been Irvine, but subsequent searches of the area have

305
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:16,160
thus far turned up nothing. Somewhere high up on the mountain, the missing piece of the Everest

306
00:26:16,160 --> 00:26:21,680
discrepancy is waiting to be found. But until that happens, all we have are the theories.

307
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:28,160
There are many arguments for and against a successful summit attempt, but most of them

308
00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:34,880
hinge on one unknowable variable. Whether George Mallory, while tantalizingly close to his defining

309
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:41,600
achievement, would have chosen to turn back. Away from the mountains, Mallory had a beloved wife and

310
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:47,840
children. After the 1924 expedition, he was known to have aspirations of becoming a rider.

311
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:54,240
He certainly was in no position to throw his life away, nor endanger the life of his young climbing

312
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:59,680
partner. However, the imposing allure of the Everest summit can have a strange effect on people.

313
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:05,520
Many climbers who attempt Everest report a psychological phenomenon known as summit fever,

314
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:10,880
where they become affixed in a trance-like state compelling them to either reach the summit or die

315
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:17,520
trying. Death was no stranger to George Mallory, who had witnessed the horrors of World War I,

316
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:22,560
an event so traumatizing that it profoundly altered the way a generation of men understood

317
00:27:22,560 --> 00:27:27,680
the concept of life and death. Many soldiers who lived through the slaughter would go on to

318
00:27:27,680 --> 00:27:33,440
develop survivor's guilt, a condition where survivors of a mass tragedy experienced sorrow

319
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:39,440
and regret over not perishing alongside their peers. Death was so common in the Great War that

320
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:45,600
many began to see valiant self-sacrifice as an expectation. It's possible that as Mallory was

321
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:51,200
staring down his greatest adversary, he may have been thinking the same way. It's tough to think

322
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:56,960
clearly in oxygen-starved conditions, and chasing the summit had already once enticed Mallory into

323
00:27:56,960 --> 00:28:02,400
a reckless decision. Considering what was at stake in that moment, one has to wonder whether the

324
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:08,560
temptation was too much to resist. At the end of the day, the summit question may simply come down

325
00:28:08,560 --> 00:28:14,720
to the limits of human obsession. But as far as any of us are concerned, does it really matter if

326
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:20,800
Mallory or Irvin made it to the summit? Regardless of whether they succeeded or failed, we managed

327
00:28:20,800 --> 00:28:26,800
to reach the top of Everest anyway, and we did so long ago. We have since reached the summit along

328
00:28:26,800 --> 00:28:33,120
every ridge and during every season. As of now, over 4,000 people have stood atop Everest,

329
00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:40,560
including a 13-year-old, an 80-year-old, a blind man, a double amputee, and in 1995, George Mallory,

330
00:28:40,560 --> 00:28:44,560
who conquered the mountain that took his grandfather's life all those years ago.

331
00:28:45,280 --> 00:28:50,320
Today, climbers can reach the summit by following a fixed rope that extends all the way down to

332
00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:55,920
base camp. The summit trek has become so foolproof that practically anyone in good health with

333
00:28:55,920 --> 00:29:01,520
$50,000 and a few weeks to spare can reach the top of the tallest mountain in the world.

334
00:29:01,520 --> 00:29:06,400
What used to be considered the most astounding achievement in human exploration has since been

335
00:29:06,400 --> 00:29:11,840
relegated to a neat trophy to brag about at a cocktail party. It's somewhat disheartening to

336
00:29:11,840 --> 00:29:17,040
see how even a place as mystifying as Everest eventually found a way to be commodified and

337
00:29:17,040 --> 00:29:23,200
commercialized. These days, it seems that there are hardly any frontiers left to explore. As of

338
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:28,880
now, the greatest discoveries reside not in mountains, but in mysteries. We may never know

339
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:34,000
for sure what happened to Mallory and Irvin, but pretty much all of us can be confident about one

340
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:40,480
thing. No one would prefer if they had failed. It's a shame that history only tends to remember

341
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:46,240
the first, because so many other remarkable stories and people get lost in the fold. Whether

342
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:51,280
or not Mallory and Irvin made it to the summit, the fact remains that they both gave their lives

343
00:29:51,280 --> 00:29:56,800
trying to push the needle of human achievement. It's chilling to consider someone spending their

344
00:29:56,800 --> 00:30:02,240
final moments stranded high above the clouds with no hope of rescue. You can only imagine

345
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:09,200
how lonely it must feel, but in a spiritual sense, the greatest pioneers are never truly alone.

346
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:15,680
While on the precipice of making history, all of mankind is with them. If they were to fail,

347
00:30:15,680 --> 00:30:22,320
so would the rest of us. Human beings are defined by challenging the unknown. The innate desire to

348
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:28,400
explore unifies us all. We will not rest until every summit is reached and every question is

349
00:30:28,400 --> 00:30:34,720
answered. George Mallory put it rather succinctly back in a 1923 interview for the New York Times.

350
00:30:35,280 --> 00:30:39,920
When asked why he wanted to climb Everest, he simply responded with the three most

351
00:30:39,920 --> 00:30:53,520
famous words in mountaineering, because it's there.
