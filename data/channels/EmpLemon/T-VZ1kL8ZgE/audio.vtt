00:00.000 --> 00:04.560
Always remember, if you ain't first, you're last.

00:04.560 --> 00:07.680
Columbus, Washington, Armstrong.

00:07.680 --> 00:12.400
To most, these names are remembered for one reason and one reason only.

00:12.400 --> 00:16.240
They were each the first to accomplish something remarkable.

00:16.240 --> 00:21.360
The word first is one of the most frequently used adjectives in the English language.

00:21.360 --> 00:26.480
Out of all descriptive concepts, first may be the most important superlative.

00:26.480 --> 00:30.240
Words we use to express the highest degree of something.

00:30.240 --> 00:34.880
First is one of the most popular superlatives because it's so unambiguous.

00:34.880 --> 00:38.160
Being the first person to do anything is a big deal.

00:38.160 --> 00:42.000
All who follow you have no choice but to know your name.

00:42.000 --> 00:44.800
If you're the first to achieve something monumental,

00:44.800 --> 00:48.400
history will remember you long after you're gone.

00:48.400 --> 00:51.600
Most superlatives end with the suffix est,

00:51.600 --> 00:56.480
a grammatical trait rather fittingly shared by the tallest mountain on the planet.

00:56.480 --> 01:00.560
Mount Everest is quite possibly the world's most famous landform.

01:00.560 --> 01:03.760
It towers nearly nine kilometers above sea level

01:03.760 --> 01:07.280
and can be seen from over 300 kilometers away,

01:07.280 --> 01:10.560
equivalent to seeing New York City from Boston.

01:10.560 --> 01:14.240
It's a well-known fact that the first person to reach the summit of Everest

01:14.240 --> 01:17.120
was Sir Edmund Hillary in 1953.

01:17.120 --> 01:20.400
It's one of those pieces of trivia that gets thrown around so much

01:20.400 --> 01:22.480
that you just stop questioning it.

01:22.480 --> 01:25.440
It seems like something that should be indisputable.

01:25.440 --> 01:29.040
The first man to set foot atop the tallest mountain.

01:29.040 --> 01:32.000
An unambiguous statement of fact.

01:32.000 --> 01:36.960
Except, 29 years before Edmund Hillary reached the top of Everest,

01:36.960 --> 01:40.240
there's a small chance, but a chance nonetheless,

01:40.240 --> 01:47.840
that someone else may have got there first.

01:47.840 --> 01:52.400
The western world first laid eyes on Everest in the middle of the 19th century,

01:52.400 --> 01:56.240
but it wasn't until 1921 when they first set foot on it.

01:56.240 --> 02:00.640
That year, the British Royal Geographic Society financed the first expedition

02:00.640 --> 02:03.440
to explore Everest and identify a route to the top.

02:04.080 --> 02:08.240
A leading member of the expedition was 34-year-old George Mallory,

02:08.240 --> 02:11.520
considered to be one of the most skilled climbers in Britain.

02:11.520 --> 02:15.680
Just five years prior, Mallory was fighting in the Battle of the Somme,

02:15.680 --> 02:17.760
where over the span of five months,

02:17.760 --> 02:21.920
the young men of Europe suffered more than 1.6 million casualties.

02:22.560 --> 02:27.280
In 1922, Mallory was about to enter one of the few places on Earth

02:27.280 --> 02:29.200
that was even more inhospitable.

02:29.920 --> 02:32.480
For millennia, civilizations around the world

02:32.480 --> 02:35.440
have considered the highest mountains to be sacred grounds.

02:36.080 --> 02:39.840
Anyone who dared to climb them would be trespassing in the realm of gods.

02:40.480 --> 02:42.880
No matter how superstitious you are,

02:42.880 --> 02:45.360
you can't deny that there are some places on Earth

02:45.600 --> 02:47.680
that human beings were never designed to go.

02:48.400 --> 02:51.760
Atop mountains like Everest, the terrain is so precarious

02:51.760 --> 02:54.720
that one misstep can result in a fatal fall.

02:54.720 --> 02:59.280
For most of the year, the summit is blasted with hurricane-force winds,

02:59.280 --> 03:01.760
enough to blow any climber clear off the mountain.

03:02.320 --> 03:05.600
Any practical attempts to reach the summit have to be conducted

03:05.600 --> 03:09.120
in roughly a 10-day window before the annual monsoon season,

03:09.120 --> 03:11.200
when wind speeds are relatively calm.

03:11.840 --> 03:15.120
Usually this window opens towards the end of May,

03:15.120 --> 03:20.080
but even then, temperatures at the top of Everest struggle to break zero degrees,

03:20.080 --> 03:23.360
cold enough to cause frostbite on exposed skin in minutes.

03:24.000 --> 03:28.000
The frigid temperatures force climbers to seek shelter by nightfall,

03:28.000 --> 03:32.160
but even the welcome warmth of the sun presents its own challenges during the day.

03:32.800 --> 03:37.200
Ultraviolet radiation becomes much more potent at high altitudes.

03:37.200 --> 03:39.600
Combined with highly reflective snow,

03:39.600 --> 03:42.640
people on Everest are at constant risk of snow blindness

03:42.640 --> 03:44.480
and other debilitating eye problems.

03:44.960 --> 03:49.040
Even during optimal weather, conditions can change in an instant.

03:49.040 --> 03:52.000
Climbers can venture onto the Everest slopes on a clear day

03:52.000 --> 03:56.560
and suddenly find themselves stranded in blizzard conditions with nowhere to hide.

03:56.560 --> 04:00.080
As if that wasn't bad enough, the roving threat of an avalanche

04:00.080 --> 04:03.280
can wipe out an entire team of climbers in a matter of seconds.

04:03.840 --> 04:08.800
However, in spite of all the deadly hazards that await climbers at the top of Everest,

04:08.800 --> 04:12.720
the single most life-threatening factor has to do with what isn't there.

04:13.520 --> 04:18.560
At 29,000 feet, air pressure is three times lower than at sea level,

04:18.560 --> 04:22.880
meaning that climbers have access to only one-third as much oxygen.

04:22.880 --> 04:27.840
Mount Everest is one of 14 summits that extends above the 8,000 meter mark,

04:27.840 --> 04:30.320
otherwise known as the Death Zone.

04:30.320 --> 04:35.680
Beyond this altitude, the human body no longer has enough oxygen to sustain itself,

04:35.680 --> 04:39.520
and within several hours, vital systems will begin to shut down.

04:40.320 --> 04:44.000
Climbers who enter this range are no longer flirting with death.

04:44.000 --> 04:46.320
They are literally in the process of dying.

04:46.960 --> 04:51.680
If anyone in the Death Zone fails to descend back to a safe altitude in time,

04:51.680 --> 04:53.840
their chances of survival are zero.

04:54.400 --> 04:58.320
The Death Zone presents an extreme complication by making any run

04:58.320 --> 05:01.440
towards the Everest summit a crucially time-sensitive event.

05:02.000 --> 05:07.040
Climbers must maintain a certain pace on the final ascent or else risk running out of oxygen.

05:07.680 --> 05:10.000
To make matters even more difficult,

05:10.000 --> 05:13.600
the thin atmosphere makes the act of climbing painstakingly slow.

05:14.320 --> 05:19.520
Most climbers near the summit have to stop to catch their breath after each individual step.

05:19.520 --> 05:25.520
The process is so exhaustive that summiters are expected to burn more than 15,000 calories,

05:25.520 --> 05:28.560
equivalent to the daily energy output of seven people.

05:29.280 --> 05:32.480
The peak of Mount Everest is in contention for the single most

05:32.480 --> 05:35.120
hazardous place on the surface of the Earth,

05:35.120 --> 05:40.080
and 99 years ago, George Mallory was one of six climbers trying to get there.

05:40.880 --> 05:46.000
On May 19, 1922, Mallory led Howard Somerville, Edward Norton,

05:46.000 --> 05:49.840
and Henry Moreshead on the first official attempt to reach the Everest summit.

05:50.480 --> 05:54.400
Across three days, the team trekked up the north side of the mountain,

05:54.400 --> 05:59.680
eventually reaching a record altitude of 8,225 meters before turning back.

06:00.400 --> 06:05.280
On May 24, George Finch and Jeffrey Bruce set off on another attempt,

06:05.280 --> 06:07.840
this time making use of supplemental oxygen.

06:08.400 --> 06:14.400
On the 27th, Finch reached a new altitude record of 8,326 meters.

06:14.400 --> 06:18.320
Immediately, Mallory was eager to make his own attempt with oxygen,

06:18.320 --> 06:20.960
believing that it was his ticket to making history.

06:21.520 --> 06:25.440
While many of the exhausted climbers were hesitant to make a third attempt,

06:26.000 --> 06:29.920
Mallory's fascination with Everest had begun to turn into an obsession.

06:30.800 --> 06:36.240
On June 3, he convinced several climbers to follow him on a hastily improvised trek to the summit.

06:36.800 --> 06:42.240
They were joined by 14 Sherpa porters who were assisting and hauling equipment to the higher camps.

06:42.800 --> 06:45.600
The expedition was now running far too late,

06:45.600 --> 06:49.360
and the monsoon had begun dumping fresh snow on the Everest slopes.

06:50.000 --> 06:55.200
On June 7, Mallory's party triggered an avalanche that buried seven porters alive.

06:55.760 --> 06:59.440
The disaster would mark the immediate end of the expedition.

06:59.440 --> 07:03.040
Mallory was criticized by his peers for his recklessness,

07:03.040 --> 07:07.200
as his sudden mania for the summit had led to a severe lapse in judgment.

07:07.920 --> 07:10.400
After the failure of 1922,

07:10.400 --> 07:14.480
he would have to wait two more years until his next chance to conquer Everest.

07:15.200 --> 07:20.560
In the spring of 1924, the British expedition crew were back in the Himalayas.

07:21.200 --> 07:25.360
Mallory, Bruce, Norton, and Somerville had returned from the previous mission,

07:25.920 --> 07:29.920
this time being joined by newcomers Noel O'Dell and Sandy Ervin.

07:30.560 --> 07:32.640
Mallory was now 37,

07:32.640 --> 07:37.920
and reconciled that this expedition would likely be his last shot at reaching the world's highest peak.

07:38.480 --> 07:43.520
The May of 1924 featured historically poor weather conditions at Everest.

07:43.520 --> 07:46.720
Not wanting a repeat of the 1922 disaster,

07:46.720 --> 07:52.320
the group decided to overrule Mallory's original plan and attempt the summit without oxygen.

07:52.320 --> 07:57.440
The change frustrated Mallory, who now viewed oxygen as a necessity to reach the summit.

07:58.080 --> 08:02.720
On June 1, Mallory and Bruce began their journey up the North Ridge.

08:02.720 --> 08:03.920
After less than a day,

08:03.920 --> 08:08.720
the pair disappointingly aborted their attempt after poor weather forced them to retreat.

08:09.360 --> 08:12.960
On June 2, Norton and Somerville began their attempt,

08:12.960 --> 08:17.440
this time finding themselves in ideal weather as they marched higher up the mountain.

08:17.440 --> 08:21.200
By June 4, the pair had made it all the way up to the Great Cold War

08:21.200 --> 08:25.360
before exhaustion and respiratory problems forced them to turn around.

08:25.360 --> 08:32.960
Edward Norton reached a new altitude record of 8,570 meters, just 280 meters beneath the summit.

08:33.520 --> 08:39.040
Mallory was originally scheduled to make one last attempt with experienced climber Noel O'Dell,

08:39.040 --> 08:43.680
but after the failed first attempt, Mallory decided to call an audible.

08:43.680 --> 08:49.120
Instead of O'Dell, Mallory would make his final run to the summit alongside the 22-year-old novice

08:49.120 --> 08:54.320
Sandy Ervin, who happened to be the most skilled oxygen technician among the expedition crew.

08:54.880 --> 08:58.160
Based on this attribute, it's clear what Mallory had in mind.

08:58.720 --> 09:02.320
On June 6, Mallory and Ervin began their ascent,

09:02.320 --> 09:06.160
each bringing with them as much oxygen as they could afford to carry.

09:06.160 --> 09:11.280
The pair were trailed by O'Dell, who was taking photos about a thousand meters farther down the

09:11.280 --> 09:17.200
slope. On the evening of the 7th, Mallory wrote a final correspondence to O'Dell before the run to

09:17.200 --> 09:21.760
the summit, saying to look out for he and Ervin near the summit skyline the next day.

09:22.480 --> 09:28.000
On the morning of June 8, O'Dell eagerly waited for visual confirmation of the climbers,

09:28.000 --> 09:31.040
but Everest's peak for the moment was obscured by mist.

09:31.600 --> 09:35.760
Then, at 1250 p.m., there was a sudden break in the cloud cover,

09:35.760 --> 09:41.520
allowing O'Dell to clearly see the summit. There, O'Dell witnessed two black dots scaling one of

09:41.520 --> 09:47.200
the rock steps on the northeast ridge, with one dot appearing to climb up and over the crest,

09:47.200 --> 09:52.560
just below the final summit pyramid. After five minutes, the mist rolled back in,

09:52.560 --> 09:58.400
and the two figures disappeared behind the clouds. This small, fleeting moment would be the last time

09:58.400 --> 10:04.080
that George Mallory and Sandy Ervin were ever seen alive. Shortly after the sighting, a storm

10:04.080 --> 10:10.000
hit the mountain, and the two climbers did not return from their attempt. O'Dell, as the closest

10:10.000 --> 10:16.560
party member, hiked up to around 8,200 meters to search for them, but after 24 hours, he signaled

10:16.560 --> 10:22.160
the rest of the crew that no trace could be found. Mallory and Ervin had been lost to the mountain.

10:22.960 --> 10:28.160
The tragedy would soon be overshadowed by the burning question looming in everyone's mind.

10:28.160 --> 10:32.080
The two climbers were on the cusp of the single greatest achievement in the history

10:32.080 --> 10:35.920
of human exploration, and no one in the world knew if they had made it.

10:47.680 --> 10:53.840
Welcome back everyone to a very special product placement. Today, the fine people at Bespoke Post

10:53.840 --> 11:00.240
have sponsored me on an expedition to become the first green man to climb the tallest mountain

11:00.240 --> 11:07.680
in Florida. I'm being joined by my Sherpa, Rusty Cage, and today, thanks to his help,

11:07.680 --> 11:12.480
we're going to be making history. Now you've seen your share of subscription boxes,

11:12.480 --> 11:19.040
but I'm telling you buddy, Bespoke Post is unlike anything you've ever seen before. Bespoke offers

11:19.040 --> 11:24.320
a variety of premium goods from under the radar brands. Many of their products come from small

11:24.320 --> 11:30.080
businesses based right here in the U.S. Whether you like cooking, fashion, or the great outdoors,

11:30.080 --> 11:36.240
Bespoke has a box for you. And unlike other subscription boxes, at Bespoke, you only pay

11:36.240 --> 11:41.520
for what you want. Each month, you get a preview your box, and if you're not satisfied, you can

11:41.520 --> 11:47.200
choose to swap it out or skip the month entirely for no charge. So for this expedition, the folks

11:47.200 --> 11:52.480
at Bespoke have provided us with the trail box and the weekender bag, and actually it

11:52.480 --> 12:01.440
looks like we're coming up on the mountain right about now. Man, that's a little bit bigger than

12:01.440 --> 12:07.600
what I was expecting. All right, I guess they did sponsor us to come out here, so

12:08.400 --> 12:16.400
gotta go climb it. All right, here we go. This is what dreams are made of right here.

12:18.160 --> 12:24.080
History in the making. Seeing that enormous mountain in front of me had me worried,

12:24.080 --> 12:29.440
but thankfully the Bespoke trail box had everything I needed to tackle the tough road ahead.

12:29.440 --> 12:34.480
The survival manual, pocket saw, and paracord bracelet should allow us to navigate this

12:34.480 --> 12:40.320
potentially deadly situation, and the gut hook knife will provide us with much needed leverage

12:40.640 --> 12:46.160
on these treacherous slopes. Just starting to get at the incline here.

12:48.240 --> 12:55.360
Still quite a ways to go, but if we keep up this fast enough vertical pace,

12:56.480 --> 12:59.520
we should be able to reach the summit by sundown.

13:03.600 --> 13:08.800
I was starting to get exhausted from ordering my Sherpa to carry the supplies up the mountain.

13:08.800 --> 13:13.760
Luckily the Bespoke weekender bag and nylon shoulder strap attachment allowed us to set

13:13.760 --> 13:21.280
up base camp right on schedule. Just a few more hours we can get there, but for now we must stop

13:21.280 --> 13:28.960
and acclimatize to the sheer altitude difference. Luckily the cozy interior of the weekender travel

13:28.960 --> 13:33.600
bag has uh kept our provisions nice and warm.

13:37.280 --> 13:40.720
I can tell you what it tastes, it tastes like history.

13:42.000 --> 13:45.840
All right we've reached a high enough altitude on the mountain

13:45.840 --> 13:49.200
where we're now required to activate our oxygen systems.

13:49.200 --> 13:54.640
All right fellas, I'll see you at the top of the mountain.

14:02.080 --> 14:10.960
We did it! I did it! I have become the first green man to climb the tallest mountain in Florida,

14:11.600 --> 14:19.840
and wow just look at that view. Oh this is just unbelievable, you must be 10, 15 feet up in the

14:19.840 --> 14:26.160
air. You sure did it Mr. Lemon and you did it all by yourself, you're a real hero. Well that's not

14:26.160 --> 14:33.440
true Sherpa Cage, I couldn't have done it without Bespoke Post. I'd like to dedicate this moment

14:33.440 --> 14:37.360
to all the people who watch my videos and consume the products.

14:40.960 --> 14:54.480
Following the 1924 Everest expedition, reporters were eager to find out whether the highest peak

14:54.480 --> 15:00.320
in the world had been reached. As the last people to see Mallory and Irvin alive, the other members

15:00.320 --> 15:06.320
of the expedition found themselves in a frenzy of media attention. Fellow climbers Odell, Norton,

15:06.320 --> 15:11.440
and Somerville were under the consensus that the pair had reached the summit. However, the greater

15:11.440 --> 15:16.880
climbing community were far more skeptical and future Everest expeditions would begin to raise

15:16.880 --> 15:22.240
major questions over the possibility of a successful attempt. Based on the testimony from

15:22.240 --> 15:27.280
Norton and Odell, the working theory was that Mallory and Irvin were attempting to reach the

15:27.280 --> 15:33.040
summit via the crest of the northeast ridge, a route which at that point had never been explored.

15:33.600 --> 15:38.480
Climbers of the time lacked the knowledge or experience to truly evaluate the difficulty of

15:38.480 --> 15:43.920
the route. A major complication that Mallory and Irvin would have had to face was a geological

15:43.920 --> 15:49.840
feature on the ridge known as the second step, one of three prominent obstacles on the final run to

15:49.840 --> 15:56.880
the summit. At an altitude of 8600 meters, the second step is a 40 meter tall near vertical rock

15:56.880 --> 16:02.480
face that spans across the entire width of the ridge. Initially it was claimed to be the rock

16:02.480 --> 16:08.160
step mentioned in Odell's eyewitness report and was supposedly surmounted by one of the climbers

16:08.160 --> 16:14.160
in just five minutes. However, as future expeditions examined the second step, Odell's

16:14.160 --> 16:20.400
statement began to appear more and more dubious. The first climbers to definitively explore the

16:20.400 --> 16:26.560
second step arrived in the 1933 expedition. One member described the rock face as utterly

16:26.560 --> 16:32.960
impregnable. Edmund Hillary's successful summit attempt in 1953 did not have to navigate the

16:32.960 --> 16:38.640
second step as he reached the summit from the south side of the mountain. The first party

16:38.640 --> 16:45.280
confirmed to successfully climb the second step was the 1960 Chinese expedition which managed to

16:45.280 --> 16:50.720
overcome the obstacle using pitons, a climbing aid which Mallory and Irvin did not have.

16:51.360 --> 16:57.600
Even with superior tools, it still took the Chinese five excruciating hours to complete the climb.

16:58.240 --> 17:03.360
Future expeditions would install a ladder to make surmounting the second step somewhat bearable.

17:04.080 --> 17:09.680
Historical hindsight of the second step's extreme difficulties shed serious doubt on whether Mallory

17:09.680 --> 17:16.320
or Irvin could have feasibly climbed it back in 1924. Irvin, a novice climber, was almost certainly

17:16.320 --> 17:22.000
out of his depth. Only Mallory would have had a realistic chance of navigating the obstacle,

17:22.000 --> 17:28.160
but many climbers today question whether even that would have been possible. Modern day mountaineers

17:28.160 --> 17:34.000
now use tiered grading scales such as the Yosemite Decimal System to assess the technical difficulty

17:34.000 --> 17:40.800
of climbing features. In the centuries since the 1924 expedition, several experts have successfully

17:40.800 --> 17:47.520
free climbed the second step and have appraised the obstacle with grades ranging from 5.6 to 5.10.

17:48.160 --> 17:54.000
Based on Mallory's climbing history, his skill has been estimated at a grade of 5.9,

17:54.000 --> 17:59.440
meaning that the second step may have been just within his capabilities. However, aside from his

17:59.440 --> 18:05.360
raw aptitude, Mallory would have also had to scale the step using rudimentary gear while hauling

18:05.360 --> 18:11.360
multiple oxygen canisters. Making an unassisted climb on an unexplored obstacle under all these

18:11.360 --> 18:16.720
circumstances would have required a superhuman effort, and to do so in the five minutes that

18:16.720 --> 18:22.400
Odell supposedly saw, it would have to have been one of the most unlikely miracles in the history

18:22.400 --> 18:27.760
of mountain climbing. It's for this reason why many have inferred that Odell did not see the

18:27.760 --> 18:33.120
two climbers surmounting the second step, but rather the comparatively easier first step.

18:33.760 --> 18:38.960
However, if this was the case, it would have provided the pair with another major complication.

18:39.600 --> 18:44.880
At the time Odell spotted the climbers, they were already four hours behind schedule.

18:44.880 --> 18:49.600
If they were as far from the summit as the first step in that moment, they would not have had

18:49.600 --> 18:55.680
enough time to reach the peak by sundown. Even if Mallory and Irvine had continued climbing into

18:55.680 --> 19:01.920
dusk, their estimated supply of oxygen would have likely run out. An additional problem working

19:01.920 --> 19:06.320
against the two climbers was the rapidly deteriorating weather conditions over the

19:06.320 --> 19:12.000
course of June 8th. Meteorological data gathered at the base camp during the expedition recorded

19:12.000 --> 19:17.120
a significant drop in barometric pressure between the 8th and 9th, which would have made the air

19:17.120 --> 19:22.800
near the summit even more thin. Everest climber Graham Hoyland extrapolated that on the day that

19:22.800 --> 19:27.600
Mallory and Irvine trekked to the summit, the drop in air pressure would have added the equivalent of

19:27.600 --> 19:33.360
180 meters to the effective altitude of the mountain. Unfortunately, their summit day

19:33.360 --> 19:38.640
coincided with the arrival of that season's monsoon, and to get to the summit, the two

19:38.640 --> 19:44.480
climbers would have had to survive the storm that hit the mountain at around 2 p.m. A modern-day

19:44.480 --> 19:49.120
thermodynamic analysis of Mallory's clothing revealed that he would not have been insulated

19:49.120 --> 19:54.560
if the wind speed had risen by a significant degree, a scenario that he likely experienced

19:54.560 --> 20:00.080
in the June 8th storm. It's probable that this sudden change in the weather ultimately led to

20:00.080 --> 20:05.040
Mallory and Irvine perishing on the mountain, but for the moment, without any knowledge of

20:05.040 --> 20:11.520
their whereabouts, a specific cause of death could not be determined. Eventually though, as more

20:11.520 --> 20:17.120
expeditions ventured up the slopes of Everest, clues began to emerge over the fate of the two

20:17.120 --> 20:24.160
wayward climbers. In 1933, crew members discovered a lost ice pick just below the first step.

20:24.720 --> 20:30.000
The pick was eventually proven to belong to Sandy Irvine, who likely dropped in near the

20:30.000 --> 20:35.200
scene of the climbers fatal accident. Now that an artifact from the missing climbers had been

20:35.200 --> 20:40.480
recovered, researchers of the mystery concluded that their final resting place couldn't have been

20:40.480 --> 20:46.560
far. Due to the extreme cold near the Everest summit, bodies stranded atop the mountain don't

20:46.560 --> 20:54.560
decompose, allowing them to essentially remain frozen in time. In 1975, Chinese climber Wang

20:54.560 --> 21:00.880
Hung Bao reported spotting a body at an altitude of 8,100 meters. Judging by their clothes, the

21:00.880 --> 21:07.200
remains must have belonged to a climber from an old British expedition. 24 years later, several

21:07.200 --> 21:13.040
researchers organized a search to locate the deceased climber. It was on that expedition that

21:13.040 --> 21:18.240
Conrad Anker discovered a corpse about 300 meters beneath the site of the lost ice pick.

21:18.800 --> 21:26.480
Lying there, face down in the snow was the body of George Mallory. Mallory's remains showed evidence

21:26.480 --> 21:32.160
of three key injuries. He suffered a broken leg, a puncture wound in the skull, and bruising from

21:32.160 --> 21:37.840
a rope around his waist. The bruising indicated that Mallory and Irvine were likely roped together

21:37.840 --> 21:43.520
when one of them fell, snapping the rope and separating the duo. Mallory's injuries were not

21:43.520 --> 21:49.120
severe enough to indicate a steep fall. He may have experienced a minor stumble at the ice axe

21:49.120 --> 21:54.400
location, after which he descended further down the slope where he suffered a second fatal fall.

21:55.200 --> 22:00.080
Several of Mallory's possessions were recovered from the scene which revealed additional clues

22:00.080 --> 22:06.000
to the summit question. His climbing goggles were found stowed away in a pocket, indicating that he

22:06.000 --> 22:11.840
was likely operating in low visibility. Mallory was probably descending after the sun had set

22:11.840 --> 22:17.760
or during storm conditions. One of his pockets concealed a note with a list of five oxygen

22:17.760 --> 22:22.800
cylinders, providing evidence that the climbers had brought one extra cylinder than previously

22:22.800 --> 22:28.160
thought. In fact, the same search mission actually recovered one of these cylinders,

22:28.160 --> 22:32.640
an artifact which marked the highest confirmed point that Mallory and Irvine reached.

22:33.600 --> 22:38.560
Rumored to be among Mallory's possessions was a photo of his wife which he planned to place at

22:38.560 --> 22:44.960
the summit. The photo was not found on Mallory's body, sparking further speculation to a successful

22:44.960 --> 22:51.360
attempt. But beyond speculation, no evidence could be found that conclusively proved whether he did

22:51.360 --> 22:57.360
or did not reach the summit. Many researchers hoped that finding George Mallory would finally

22:57.360 --> 23:02.400
provide a solution to mountaineering's greatest mystery, but it may have only created more

23:02.400 --> 23:09.200
questions than answers. Today, nearly 100 years after the tragedy, climbing experts are still

23:09.200 --> 23:14.880
split on the fate of Mallory and Irvine. Seasoned veterans like Conrad Anker and Graham Hoyland are

23:14.880 --> 23:19.680
of the opinion that they did not make it, reasoning that the duo simply had too many

23:19.680 --> 23:25.680
factors working against them. Other researchers are more optimistic. Philip Summers notes an

23:25.680 --> 23:31.440
inconsistency in the number of sleeping bags accounted for on the 1924 expedition and suggests

23:31.440 --> 23:36.480
that Mallory and Irvine may have carried two of them on their summit attempt, possibly as a means

23:36.480 --> 23:42.240
of attempting a bivouac to buy them more time. Michael Tracy offers a solution to the second

23:42.240 --> 23:47.360
step problem by suggesting that the climbers bypass the obstacle entirely by using the North

23:47.360 --> 23:54.080
Ridge traverse, which was the standard route at the time. Tracy presents a comprehensive explanation

23:54.080 --> 23:58.720
for how the pair could have followed this route while using a system of oxygen caching to reach

23:58.720 --> 24:04.080
the summit before sundown. In this case, Odell would have actually spotted the climbers at the

24:04.080 --> 24:10.240
third step, which would be far more consistent with the supposed five-minute climb. There are

24:10.240 --> 24:16.160
various other creative theories regarding Mallory and Irvine, but until further evidence surfaces,

24:16.160 --> 24:22.160
a definitive conclusion may never be reached. Fortunately, the mystery is not yet a hopeless

24:22.160 --> 24:27.840
cause, as the answer to the summit question may lie among the still undiscovered remains of Sandy

24:27.840 --> 24:33.040
Irvine. It's highly likely that if either of the two climbers reached the summit, they would have

24:33.040 --> 24:38.720
collected rock samples. The rocks found atop Everest are geologically unique to that part of

24:38.720 --> 24:43.680
the mountain. If Irvine were to be found with summit rocks, it would prove that one of the

24:43.680 --> 24:49.600
climbers had made it to the top of Everest. Curiously, the 1999 forensic search of Mallory's

24:49.600 --> 24:55.040
body neglected to check for summit rocks, so it remains unclear whether Mallory had any on his

24:55.040 --> 25:00.640
person. At the time, the prospect of rock samples had been completely overshadowed by the single

25:00.640 --> 25:07.040
most compelling missing piece from the 1924 expedition. As Mallory passed Howard Somerville

25:07.040 --> 25:12.240
on his final trek up the mountain, he asked to borrow Somerville's portable Kodak camera to

25:12.240 --> 25:18.960
capture photographs in the event of a successful attempt. When Mallory was found in 1999, the camera

25:18.960 --> 25:24.240
was not found among his possessions. Therefore, it is likely that Mallory handed off the camera

25:24.240 --> 25:30.480
to Irvine sometime during their descent. If the camera is ever located, the undeveloped film within

25:30.480 --> 25:36.000
could finally solve the mystery once and for all. Modern-day photographers have shown it's possible

25:36.000 --> 25:41.680
to develop hundred-year-old film. It's unknown whether the extreme conditions atop Everest would

25:41.680 --> 25:47.680
corrupt the process, but in the event that the camera is found, Kodak provided special instructions

25:47.680 --> 25:53.920
to give the film its best chance at survival. But before any images can be retrieved, researchers

25:53.920 --> 26:00.400
will most likely have to locate the body of Sandy Irvine first. Xu Jing of the 1960 Chinese

26:00.400 --> 26:05.440
expedition claimed to have seen a dead climber lying on his back near the first step. Many

26:05.440 --> 26:10.480
researchers have inferred that this must have been Irvine, but subsequent searches of the area have

26:10.480 --> 26:16.160
thus far turned up nothing. Somewhere high up on the mountain, the missing piece of the Everest

26:16.160 --> 26:21.680
discrepancy is waiting to be found. But until that happens, all we have are the theories.

26:22.960 --> 26:28.160
There are many arguments for and against a successful summit attempt, but most of them

26:28.160 --> 26:34.880
hinge on one unknowable variable. Whether George Mallory, while tantalizingly close to his defining

26:34.880 --> 26:41.600
achievement, would have chosen to turn back. Away from the mountains, Mallory had a beloved wife and

26:41.600 --> 26:47.840
children. After the 1924 expedition, he was known to have aspirations of becoming a rider.

26:48.400 --> 26:54.240
He certainly was in no position to throw his life away, nor endanger the life of his young climbing

26:54.240 --> 26:59.680
partner. However, the imposing allure of the Everest summit can have a strange effect on people.

27:00.240 --> 27:05.520
Many climbers who attempt Everest report a psychological phenomenon known as summit fever,

27:05.520 --> 27:10.880
where they become affixed in a trance-like state compelling them to either reach the summit or die

27:10.880 --> 27:17.520
trying. Death was no stranger to George Mallory, who had witnessed the horrors of World War I,

27:17.520 --> 27:22.560
an event so traumatizing that it profoundly altered the way a generation of men understood

27:22.560 --> 27:27.680
the concept of life and death. Many soldiers who lived through the slaughter would go on to

27:27.680 --> 27:33.440
develop survivor's guilt, a condition where survivors of a mass tragedy experienced sorrow

27:33.440 --> 27:39.440
and regret over not perishing alongside their peers. Death was so common in the Great War that

27:39.440 --> 27:45.600
many began to see valiant self-sacrifice as an expectation. It's possible that as Mallory was

27:45.600 --> 27:51.200
staring down his greatest adversary, he may have been thinking the same way. It's tough to think

27:51.200 --> 27:56.960
clearly in oxygen-starved conditions, and chasing the summit had already once enticed Mallory into

27:56.960 --> 28:02.400
a reckless decision. Considering what was at stake in that moment, one has to wonder whether the

28:02.400 --> 28:08.560
temptation was too much to resist. At the end of the day, the summit question may simply come down

28:08.560 --> 28:14.720
to the limits of human obsession. But as far as any of us are concerned, does it really matter if

28:14.720 --> 28:20.800
Mallory or Irvin made it to the summit? Regardless of whether they succeeded or failed, we managed

28:20.800 --> 28:26.800
to reach the top of Everest anyway, and we did so long ago. We have since reached the summit along

28:26.800 --> 28:33.120
every ridge and during every season. As of now, over 4,000 people have stood atop Everest,

28:33.120 --> 28:40.560
including a 13-year-old, an 80-year-old, a blind man, a double amputee, and in 1995, George Mallory,

28:40.560 --> 28:44.560
who conquered the mountain that took his grandfather's life all those years ago.

28:45.280 --> 28:50.320
Today, climbers can reach the summit by following a fixed rope that extends all the way down to

28:50.320 --> 28:55.920
base camp. The summit trek has become so foolproof that practically anyone in good health with

28:55.920 --> 29:01.520
$50,000 and a few weeks to spare can reach the top of the tallest mountain in the world.

29:01.520 --> 29:06.400
What used to be considered the most astounding achievement in human exploration has since been

29:06.400 --> 29:11.840
relegated to a neat trophy to brag about at a cocktail party. It's somewhat disheartening to

29:11.840 --> 29:17.040
see how even a place as mystifying as Everest eventually found a way to be commodified and

29:17.040 --> 29:23.200
commercialized. These days, it seems that there are hardly any frontiers left to explore. As of

29:23.200 --> 29:28.880
now, the greatest discoveries reside not in mountains, but in mysteries. We may never know

29:28.880 --> 29:34.000
for sure what happened to Mallory and Irvin, but pretty much all of us can be confident about one

29:34.000 --> 29:40.480
thing. No one would prefer if they had failed. It's a shame that history only tends to remember

29:40.480 --> 29:46.240
the first, because so many other remarkable stories and people get lost in the fold. Whether

29:46.240 --> 29:51.280
or not Mallory and Irvin made it to the summit, the fact remains that they both gave their lives

29:51.280 --> 29:56.800
trying to push the needle of human achievement. It's chilling to consider someone spending their

29:56.800 --> 30:02.240
final moments stranded high above the clouds with no hope of rescue. You can only imagine

30:02.240 --> 30:09.200
how lonely it must feel, but in a spiritual sense, the greatest pioneers are never truly alone.

30:09.200 --> 30:15.680
While on the precipice of making history, all of mankind is with them. If they were to fail,

30:15.680 --> 30:22.320
so would the rest of us. Human beings are defined by challenging the unknown. The innate desire to

30:22.320 --> 30:28.400
explore unifies us all. We will not rest until every summit is reached and every question is

30:28.400 --> 30:34.720
answered. George Mallory put it rather succinctly back in a 1923 interview for the New York Times.

30:35.280 --> 30:39.920
When asked why he wanted to climb Everest, he simply responded with the three most

30:39.920 --> 30:53.520
famous words in mountaineering, because it's there.
