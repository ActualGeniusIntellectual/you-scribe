0	4560	Always remember, if you ain't first, you're last.
4560	7680	Columbus, Washington, Armstrong.
7680	12400	To most, these names are remembered for one reason and one reason only.
12400	16240	They were each the first to accomplish something remarkable.
16240	21360	The word first is one of the most frequently used adjectives in the English language.
21360	26480	Out of all descriptive concepts, first may be the most important superlative.
26480	30240	Words we use to express the highest degree of something.
30240	34880	First is one of the most popular superlatives because it's so unambiguous.
34880	38160	Being the first person to do anything is a big deal.
38160	42000	All who follow you have no choice but to know your name.
42000	44800	If you're the first to achieve something monumental,
44800	48400	history will remember you long after you're gone.
48400	51600	Most superlatives end with the suffix est,
51600	56480	a grammatical trait rather fittingly shared by the tallest mountain on the planet.
56480	60560	Mount Everest is quite possibly the world's most famous landform.
60560	63760	It towers nearly nine kilometers above sea level
63760	67280	and can be seen from over 300 kilometers away,
67280	70560	equivalent to seeing New York City from Boston.
70560	74240	It's a well-known fact that the first person to reach the summit of Everest
74240	77120	was Sir Edmund Hillary in 1953.
77120	80400	It's one of those pieces of trivia that gets thrown around so much
80400	82480	that you just stop questioning it.
82480	85440	It seems like something that should be indisputable.
85440	89040	The first man to set foot atop the tallest mountain.
89040	92000	An unambiguous statement of fact.
92000	96960	Except, 29 years before Edmund Hillary reached the top of Everest,
96960	100240	there's a small chance, but a chance nonetheless,
100240	107840	that someone else may have got there first.
107840	112400	The western world first laid eyes on Everest in the middle of the 19th century,
112400	116240	but it wasn't until 1921 when they first set foot on it.
116240	120640	That year, the British Royal Geographic Society financed the first expedition
120640	123440	to explore Everest and identify a route to the top.
124080	128240	A leading member of the expedition was 34-year-old George Mallory,
128240	131520	considered to be one of the most skilled climbers in Britain.
131520	135680	Just five years prior, Mallory was fighting in the Battle of the Somme,
135680	137760	where over the span of five months,
137760	141920	the young men of Europe suffered more than 1.6 million casualties.
142560	147280	In 1922, Mallory was about to enter one of the few places on Earth
147280	149200	that was even more inhospitable.
149920	152480	For millennia, civilizations around the world
152480	155440	have considered the highest mountains to be sacred grounds.
156080	159840	Anyone who dared to climb them would be trespassing in the realm of gods.
160480	162880	No matter how superstitious you are,
162880	165360	you can't deny that there are some places on Earth
165600	167680	that human beings were never designed to go.
168400	171760	Atop mountains like Everest, the terrain is so precarious
171760	174720	that one misstep can result in a fatal fall.
174720	179280	For most of the year, the summit is blasted with hurricane-force winds,
179280	181760	enough to blow any climber clear off the mountain.
182320	185600	Any practical attempts to reach the summit have to be conducted
185600	189120	in roughly a 10-day window before the annual monsoon season,
189120	191200	when wind speeds are relatively calm.
191840	195120	Usually this window opens towards the end of May,
195120	200080	but even then, temperatures at the top of Everest struggle to break zero degrees,
200080	203360	cold enough to cause frostbite on exposed skin in minutes.
204000	208000	The frigid temperatures force climbers to seek shelter by nightfall,
208000	212160	but even the welcome warmth of the sun presents its own challenges during the day.
212800	217200	Ultraviolet radiation becomes much more potent at high altitudes.
217200	219600	Combined with highly reflective snow,
219600	222640	people on Everest are at constant risk of snow blindness
222640	224480	and other debilitating eye problems.
224960	229040	Even during optimal weather, conditions can change in an instant.
229040	232000	Climbers can venture onto the Everest slopes on a clear day
232000	236560	and suddenly find themselves stranded in blizzard conditions with nowhere to hide.
236560	240080	As if that wasn't bad enough, the roving threat of an avalanche
240080	243280	can wipe out an entire team of climbers in a matter of seconds.
243840	248800	However, in spite of all the deadly hazards that await climbers at the top of Everest,
248800	252720	the single most life-threatening factor has to do with what isn't there.
253520	258560	At 29,000 feet, air pressure is three times lower than at sea level,
258560	262880	meaning that climbers have access to only one-third as much oxygen.
262880	267840	Mount Everest is one of 14 summits that extends above the 8,000 meter mark,
267840	270320	otherwise known as the Death Zone.
270320	275680	Beyond this altitude, the human body no longer has enough oxygen to sustain itself,
275680	279520	and within several hours, vital systems will begin to shut down.
280320	284000	Climbers who enter this range are no longer flirting with death.
284000	286320	They are literally in the process of dying.
286960	291680	If anyone in the Death Zone fails to descend back to a safe altitude in time,
291680	293840	their chances of survival are zero.
294400	298320	The Death Zone presents an extreme complication by making any run
298320	301440	towards the Everest summit a crucially time-sensitive event.
302000	307040	Climbers must maintain a certain pace on the final ascent or else risk running out of oxygen.
307680	310000	To make matters even more difficult,
310000	313600	the thin atmosphere makes the act of climbing painstakingly slow.
314320	319520	Most climbers near the summit have to stop to catch their breath after each individual step.
319520	325520	The process is so exhaustive that summiters are expected to burn more than 15,000 calories,
325520	328560	equivalent to the daily energy output of seven people.
329280	332480	The peak of Mount Everest is in contention for the single most
332480	335120	hazardous place on the surface of the Earth,
335120	340080	and 99 years ago, George Mallory was one of six climbers trying to get there.
340880	346000	On May 19, 1922, Mallory led Howard Somerville, Edward Norton,
346000	349840	and Henry Moreshead on the first official attempt to reach the Everest summit.
350480	354400	Across three days, the team trekked up the north side of the mountain,
354400	359680	eventually reaching a record altitude of 8,225 meters before turning back.
360400	365280	On May 24, George Finch and Jeffrey Bruce set off on another attempt,
365280	367840	this time making use of supplemental oxygen.
368400	374400	On the 27th, Finch reached a new altitude record of 8,326 meters.
374400	378320	Immediately, Mallory was eager to make his own attempt with oxygen,
378320	380960	believing that it was his ticket to making history.
381520	385440	While many of the exhausted climbers were hesitant to make a third attempt,
386000	389920	Mallory's fascination with Everest had begun to turn into an obsession.
390800	396240	On June 3, he convinced several climbers to follow him on a hastily improvised trek to the summit.
396800	402240	They were joined by 14 Sherpa porters who were assisting and hauling equipment to the higher camps.
402800	405600	The expedition was now running far too late,
405600	409360	and the monsoon had begun dumping fresh snow on the Everest slopes.
410000	415200	On June 7, Mallory's party triggered an avalanche that buried seven porters alive.
415760	419440	The disaster would mark the immediate end of the expedition.
419440	423040	Mallory was criticized by his peers for his recklessness,
423040	427200	as his sudden mania for the summit had led to a severe lapse in judgment.
427920	430400	After the failure of 1922,
430400	434480	he would have to wait two more years until his next chance to conquer Everest.
435200	440560	In the spring of 1924, the British expedition crew were back in the Himalayas.
441200	445360	Mallory, Bruce, Norton, and Somerville had returned from the previous mission,
445920	449920	this time being joined by newcomers Noel O'Dell and Sandy Ervin.
450560	452640	Mallory was now 37,
452640	457920	and reconciled that this expedition would likely be his last shot at reaching the world's highest peak.
458480	463520	The May of 1924 featured historically poor weather conditions at Everest.
463520	466720	Not wanting a repeat of the 1922 disaster,
466720	472320	the group decided to overrule Mallory's original plan and attempt the summit without oxygen.
472320	477440	The change frustrated Mallory, who now viewed oxygen as a necessity to reach the summit.
478080	482720	On June 1, Mallory and Bruce began their journey up the North Ridge.
482720	483920	After less than a day,
483920	488720	the pair disappointingly aborted their attempt after poor weather forced them to retreat.
489360	492960	On June 2, Norton and Somerville began their attempt,
492960	497440	this time finding themselves in ideal weather as they marched higher up the mountain.
497440	501200	By June 4, the pair had made it all the way up to the Great Cold War
501200	505360	before exhaustion and respiratory problems forced them to turn around.
505360	512960	Edward Norton reached a new altitude record of 8,570 meters, just 280 meters beneath the summit.
513520	519040	Mallory was originally scheduled to make one last attempt with experienced climber Noel O'Dell,
519040	523680	but after the failed first attempt, Mallory decided to call an audible.
523680	529120	Instead of O'Dell, Mallory would make his final run to the summit alongside the 22-year-old novice
529120	534320	Sandy Ervin, who happened to be the most skilled oxygen technician among the expedition crew.
534880	538160	Based on this attribute, it's clear what Mallory had in mind.
538720	542320	On June 6, Mallory and Ervin began their ascent,
542320	546160	each bringing with them as much oxygen as they could afford to carry.
546160	551280	The pair were trailed by O'Dell, who was taking photos about a thousand meters farther down the
551280	557200	slope. On the evening of the 7th, Mallory wrote a final correspondence to O'Dell before the run to
557200	561760	the summit, saying to look out for he and Ervin near the summit skyline the next day.
562480	568000	On the morning of June 8, O'Dell eagerly waited for visual confirmation of the climbers,
568000	571040	but Everest's peak for the moment was obscured by mist.
571600	575760	Then, at 1250 p.m., there was a sudden break in the cloud cover,
575760	581520	allowing O'Dell to clearly see the summit. There, O'Dell witnessed two black dots scaling one of
581520	587200	the rock steps on the northeast ridge, with one dot appearing to climb up and over the crest,
587200	592560	just below the final summit pyramid. After five minutes, the mist rolled back in,
592560	598400	and the two figures disappeared behind the clouds. This small, fleeting moment would be the last time
598400	604080	that George Mallory and Sandy Ervin were ever seen alive. Shortly after the sighting, a storm
604080	610000	hit the mountain, and the two climbers did not return from their attempt. O'Dell, as the closest
610000	616560	party member, hiked up to around 8,200 meters to search for them, but after 24 hours, he signaled
616560	622160	the rest of the crew that no trace could be found. Mallory and Ervin had been lost to the mountain.
622960	628160	The tragedy would soon be overshadowed by the burning question looming in everyone's mind.
628160	632080	The two climbers were on the cusp of the single greatest achievement in the history
632080	635920	of human exploration, and no one in the world knew if they had made it.
647680	653840	Welcome back everyone to a very special product placement. Today, the fine people at Bespoke Post
653840	660240	have sponsored me on an expedition to become the first green man to climb the tallest mountain
660240	667680	in Florida. I'm being joined by my Sherpa, Rusty Cage, and today, thanks to his help,
667680	672480	we're going to be making history. Now you've seen your share of subscription boxes,
672480	679040	but I'm telling you buddy, Bespoke Post is unlike anything you've ever seen before. Bespoke offers
679040	684320	a variety of premium goods from under the radar brands. Many of their products come from small
684320	690080	businesses based right here in the U.S. Whether you like cooking, fashion, or the great outdoors,
690080	696240	Bespoke has a box for you. And unlike other subscription boxes, at Bespoke, you only pay
696240	701520	for what you want. Each month, you get a preview your box, and if you're not satisfied, you can
701520	707200	choose to swap it out or skip the month entirely for no charge. So for this expedition, the folks
707200	712480	at Bespoke have provided us with the trail box and the weekender bag, and actually it
712480	721440	looks like we're coming up on the mountain right about now. Man, that's a little bit bigger than
721440	727600	what I was expecting. All right, I guess they did sponsor us to come out here, so
728400	736400	gotta go climb it. All right, here we go. This is what dreams are made of right here.
738160	744080	History in the making. Seeing that enormous mountain in front of me had me worried,
744080	749440	but thankfully the Bespoke trail box had everything I needed to tackle the tough road ahead.
749440	754480	The survival manual, pocket saw, and paracord bracelet should allow us to navigate this
754480	760320	potentially deadly situation, and the gut hook knife will provide us with much needed leverage
760640	766160	on these treacherous slopes. Just starting to get at the incline here.
768240	775360	Still quite a ways to go, but if we keep up this fast enough vertical pace,
776480	779520	we should be able to reach the summit by sundown.
783600	788800	I was starting to get exhausted from ordering my Sherpa to carry the supplies up the mountain.
788800	793760	Luckily the Bespoke weekender bag and nylon shoulder strap attachment allowed us to set
793760	801280	up base camp right on schedule. Just a few more hours we can get there, but for now we must stop
801280	808960	and acclimatize to the sheer altitude difference. Luckily the cozy interior of the weekender travel
808960	813600	bag has uh kept our provisions nice and warm.
817280	820720	I can tell you what it tastes, it tastes like history.
822000	825840	All right we've reached a high enough altitude on the mountain
825840	829200	where we're now required to activate our oxygen systems.
829200	834640	All right fellas, I'll see you at the top of the mountain.
842080	850960	We did it! I did it! I have become the first green man to climb the tallest mountain in Florida,
851600	859840	and wow just look at that view. Oh this is just unbelievable, you must be 10, 15 feet up in the
859840	866160	air. You sure did it Mr. Lemon and you did it all by yourself, you're a real hero. Well that's not
866160	873440	true Sherpa Cage, I couldn't have done it without Bespoke Post. I'd like to dedicate this moment
873440	877360	to all the people who watch my videos and consume the products.
880960	894480	Following the 1924 Everest expedition, reporters were eager to find out whether the highest peak
894480	900320	in the world had been reached. As the last people to see Mallory and Irvin alive, the other members
900320	906320	of the expedition found themselves in a frenzy of media attention. Fellow climbers Odell, Norton,
906320	911440	and Somerville were under the consensus that the pair had reached the summit. However, the greater
911440	916880	climbing community were far more skeptical and future Everest expeditions would begin to raise
916880	922240	major questions over the possibility of a successful attempt. Based on the testimony from
922240	927280	Norton and Odell, the working theory was that Mallory and Irvin were attempting to reach the
927280	933040	summit via the crest of the northeast ridge, a route which at that point had never been explored.
933600	938480	Climbers of the time lacked the knowledge or experience to truly evaluate the difficulty of
938480	943920	the route. A major complication that Mallory and Irvin would have had to face was a geological
943920	949840	feature on the ridge known as the second step, one of three prominent obstacles on the final run to
949840	956880	the summit. At an altitude of 8600 meters, the second step is a 40 meter tall near vertical rock
956880	962480	face that spans across the entire width of the ridge. Initially it was claimed to be the rock
962480	968160	step mentioned in Odell's eyewitness report and was supposedly surmounted by one of the climbers
968160	974160	in just five minutes. However, as future expeditions examined the second step, Odell's
974160	980400	statement began to appear more and more dubious. The first climbers to definitively explore the
980400	986560	second step arrived in the 1933 expedition. One member described the rock face as utterly
986560	992960	impregnable. Edmund Hillary's successful summit attempt in 1953 did not have to navigate the
992960	998640	second step as he reached the summit from the south side of the mountain. The first party
998640	1005280	confirmed to successfully climb the second step was the 1960 Chinese expedition which managed to
1005280	1010720	overcome the obstacle using pitons, a climbing aid which Mallory and Irvin did not have.
1011360	1017600	Even with superior tools, it still took the Chinese five excruciating hours to complete the climb.
1018240	1023360	Future expeditions would install a ladder to make surmounting the second step somewhat bearable.
1024080	1029680	Historical hindsight of the second step's extreme difficulties shed serious doubt on whether Mallory
1029680	1036320	or Irvin could have feasibly climbed it back in 1924. Irvin, a novice climber, was almost certainly
1036320	1042000	out of his depth. Only Mallory would have had a realistic chance of navigating the obstacle,
1042000	1048160	but many climbers today question whether even that would have been possible. Modern day mountaineers
1048160	1054000	now use tiered grading scales such as the Yosemite Decimal System to assess the technical difficulty
1054000	1060800	of climbing features. In the centuries since the 1924 expedition, several experts have successfully
1060800	1067520	free climbed the second step and have appraised the obstacle with grades ranging from 5.6 to 5.10.
1068160	1074000	Based on Mallory's climbing history, his skill has been estimated at a grade of 5.9,
1074000	1079440	meaning that the second step may have been just within his capabilities. However, aside from his
1079440	1085360	raw aptitude, Mallory would have also had to scale the step using rudimentary gear while hauling
1085360	1091360	multiple oxygen canisters. Making an unassisted climb on an unexplored obstacle under all these
1091360	1096720	circumstances would have required a superhuman effort, and to do so in the five minutes that
1096720	1102400	Odell supposedly saw, it would have to have been one of the most unlikely miracles in the history
1102400	1107760	of mountain climbing. It's for this reason why many have inferred that Odell did not see the
1107760	1113120	two climbers surmounting the second step, but rather the comparatively easier first step.
1113760	1118960	However, if this was the case, it would have provided the pair with another major complication.
1119600	1124880	At the time Odell spotted the climbers, they were already four hours behind schedule.
1124880	1129600	If they were as far from the summit as the first step in that moment, they would not have had
1129600	1135680	enough time to reach the peak by sundown. Even if Mallory and Irvine had continued climbing into
1135680	1141920	dusk, their estimated supply of oxygen would have likely run out. An additional problem working
1141920	1146320	against the two climbers was the rapidly deteriorating weather conditions over the
1146320	1152000	course of June 8th. Meteorological data gathered at the base camp during the expedition recorded
1152000	1157120	a significant drop in barometric pressure between the 8th and 9th, which would have made the air
1157120	1162800	near the summit even more thin. Everest climber Graham Hoyland extrapolated that on the day that
1162800	1167600	Mallory and Irvine trekked to the summit, the drop in air pressure would have added the equivalent of
1167600	1173360	180 meters to the effective altitude of the mountain. Unfortunately, their summit day
1173360	1178640	coincided with the arrival of that season's monsoon, and to get to the summit, the two
1178640	1184480	climbers would have had to survive the storm that hit the mountain at around 2 p.m. A modern-day
1184480	1189120	thermodynamic analysis of Mallory's clothing revealed that he would not have been insulated
1189120	1194560	if the wind speed had risen by a significant degree, a scenario that he likely experienced
1194560	1200080	in the June 8th storm. It's probable that this sudden change in the weather ultimately led to
1200080	1205040	Mallory and Irvine perishing on the mountain, but for the moment, without any knowledge of
1205040	1211520	their whereabouts, a specific cause of death could not be determined. Eventually though, as more
1211520	1217120	expeditions ventured up the slopes of Everest, clues began to emerge over the fate of the two
1217120	1224160	wayward climbers. In 1933, crew members discovered a lost ice pick just below the first step.
1224720	1230000	The pick was eventually proven to belong to Sandy Irvine, who likely dropped in near the
1230000	1235200	scene of the climbers fatal accident. Now that an artifact from the missing climbers had been
1235200	1240480	recovered, researchers of the mystery concluded that their final resting place couldn't have been
1240480	1246560	far. Due to the extreme cold near the Everest summit, bodies stranded atop the mountain don't
1246560	1254560	decompose, allowing them to essentially remain frozen in time. In 1975, Chinese climber Wang
1254560	1260880	Hung Bao reported spotting a body at an altitude of 8,100 meters. Judging by their clothes, the
1260880	1267200	remains must have belonged to a climber from an old British expedition. 24 years later, several
1267200	1273040	researchers organized a search to locate the deceased climber. It was on that expedition that
1273040	1278240	Conrad Anker discovered a corpse about 300 meters beneath the site of the lost ice pick.
1278800	1286480	Lying there, face down in the snow was the body of George Mallory. Mallory's remains showed evidence
1286480	1292160	of three key injuries. He suffered a broken leg, a puncture wound in the skull, and bruising from
1292160	1297840	a rope around his waist. The bruising indicated that Mallory and Irvine were likely roped together
1297840	1303520	when one of them fell, snapping the rope and separating the duo. Mallory's injuries were not
1303520	1309120	severe enough to indicate a steep fall. He may have experienced a minor stumble at the ice axe
1309120	1314400	location, after which he descended further down the slope where he suffered a second fatal fall.
1315200	1320080	Several of Mallory's possessions were recovered from the scene which revealed additional clues
1320080	1326000	to the summit question. His climbing goggles were found stowed away in a pocket, indicating that he
1326000	1331840	was likely operating in low visibility. Mallory was probably descending after the sun had set
1331840	1337760	or during storm conditions. One of his pockets concealed a note with a list of five oxygen
1337760	1342800	cylinders, providing evidence that the climbers had brought one extra cylinder than previously
1342800	1348160	thought. In fact, the same search mission actually recovered one of these cylinders,
1348160	1352640	an artifact which marked the highest confirmed point that Mallory and Irvine reached.
1353600	1358560	Rumored to be among Mallory's possessions was a photo of his wife which he planned to place at
1358560	1364960	the summit. The photo was not found on Mallory's body, sparking further speculation to a successful
1364960	1371360	attempt. But beyond speculation, no evidence could be found that conclusively proved whether he did
1371360	1377360	or did not reach the summit. Many researchers hoped that finding George Mallory would finally
1377360	1382400	provide a solution to mountaineering's greatest mystery, but it may have only created more
1382400	1389200	questions than answers. Today, nearly 100 years after the tragedy, climbing experts are still
1389200	1394880	split on the fate of Mallory and Irvine. Seasoned veterans like Conrad Anker and Graham Hoyland are
1394880	1399680	of the opinion that they did not make it, reasoning that the duo simply had too many
1399680	1405680	factors working against them. Other researchers are more optimistic. Philip Summers notes an
1405680	1411440	inconsistency in the number of sleeping bags accounted for on the 1924 expedition and suggests
1411440	1416480	that Mallory and Irvine may have carried two of them on their summit attempt, possibly as a means
1416480	1422240	of attempting a bivouac to buy them more time. Michael Tracy offers a solution to the second
1422240	1427360	step problem by suggesting that the climbers bypass the obstacle entirely by using the North
1427360	1434080	Ridge traverse, which was the standard route at the time. Tracy presents a comprehensive explanation
1434080	1438720	for how the pair could have followed this route while using a system of oxygen caching to reach
1438720	1444080	the summit before sundown. In this case, Odell would have actually spotted the climbers at the
1444080	1450240	third step, which would be far more consistent with the supposed five-minute climb. There are
1450240	1456160	various other creative theories regarding Mallory and Irvine, but until further evidence surfaces,
1456160	1462160	a definitive conclusion may never be reached. Fortunately, the mystery is not yet a hopeless
1462160	1467840	cause, as the answer to the summit question may lie among the still undiscovered remains of Sandy
1467840	1473040	Irvine. It's highly likely that if either of the two climbers reached the summit, they would have
1473040	1478720	collected rock samples. The rocks found atop Everest are geologically unique to that part of
1478720	1483680	the mountain. If Irvine were to be found with summit rocks, it would prove that one of the
1483680	1489600	climbers had made it to the top of Everest. Curiously, the 1999 forensic search of Mallory's
1489600	1495040	body neglected to check for summit rocks, so it remains unclear whether Mallory had any on his
1495040	1500640	person. At the time, the prospect of rock samples had been completely overshadowed by the single
1500640	1507040	most compelling missing piece from the 1924 expedition. As Mallory passed Howard Somerville
1507040	1512240	on his final trek up the mountain, he asked to borrow Somerville's portable Kodak camera to
1512240	1518960	capture photographs in the event of a successful attempt. When Mallory was found in 1999, the camera
1518960	1524240	was not found among his possessions. Therefore, it is likely that Mallory handed off the camera
1524240	1530480	to Irvine sometime during their descent. If the camera is ever located, the undeveloped film within
1530480	1536000	could finally solve the mystery once and for all. Modern-day photographers have shown it's possible
1536000	1541680	to develop hundred-year-old film. It's unknown whether the extreme conditions atop Everest would
1541680	1547680	corrupt the process, but in the event that the camera is found, Kodak provided special instructions
1547680	1553920	to give the film its best chance at survival. But before any images can be retrieved, researchers
1553920	1560400	will most likely have to locate the body of Sandy Irvine first. Xu Jing of the 1960 Chinese
1560400	1565440	expedition claimed to have seen a dead climber lying on his back near the first step. Many
1565440	1570480	researchers have inferred that this must have been Irvine, but subsequent searches of the area have
1570480	1576160	thus far turned up nothing. Somewhere high up on the mountain, the missing piece of the Everest
1576160	1581680	discrepancy is waiting to be found. But until that happens, all we have are the theories.
1582960	1588160	There are many arguments for and against a successful summit attempt, but most of them
1588160	1594880	hinge on one unknowable variable. Whether George Mallory, while tantalizingly close to his defining
1594880	1601600	achievement, would have chosen to turn back. Away from the mountains, Mallory had a beloved wife and
1601600	1607840	children. After the 1924 expedition, he was known to have aspirations of becoming a rider.
1608400	1614240	He certainly was in no position to throw his life away, nor endanger the life of his young climbing
1614240	1619680	partner. However, the imposing allure of the Everest summit can have a strange effect on people.
1620240	1625520	Many climbers who attempt Everest report a psychological phenomenon known as summit fever,
1625520	1630880	where they become affixed in a trance-like state compelling them to either reach the summit or die
1630880	1637520	trying. Death was no stranger to George Mallory, who had witnessed the horrors of World War I,
1637520	1642560	an event so traumatizing that it profoundly altered the way a generation of men understood
1642560	1647680	the concept of life and death. Many soldiers who lived through the slaughter would go on to
1647680	1653440	develop survivor's guilt, a condition where survivors of a mass tragedy experienced sorrow
1653440	1659440	and regret over not perishing alongside their peers. Death was so common in the Great War that
1659440	1665600	many began to see valiant self-sacrifice as an expectation. It's possible that as Mallory was
1665600	1671200	staring down his greatest adversary, he may have been thinking the same way. It's tough to think
1671200	1676960	clearly in oxygen-starved conditions, and chasing the summit had already once enticed Mallory into
1676960	1682400	a reckless decision. Considering what was at stake in that moment, one has to wonder whether the
1682400	1688560	temptation was too much to resist. At the end of the day, the summit question may simply come down
1688560	1694720	to the limits of human obsession. But as far as any of us are concerned, does it really matter if
1694720	1700800	Mallory or Irvin made it to the summit? Regardless of whether they succeeded or failed, we managed
1700800	1706800	to reach the top of Everest anyway, and we did so long ago. We have since reached the summit along
1706800	1713120	every ridge and during every season. As of now, over 4,000 people have stood atop Everest,
1713120	1720560	including a 13-year-old, an 80-year-old, a blind man, a double amputee, and in 1995, George Mallory,
1720560	1724560	who conquered the mountain that took his grandfather's life all those years ago.
1725280	1730320	Today, climbers can reach the summit by following a fixed rope that extends all the way down to
1730320	1735920	base camp. The summit trek has become so foolproof that practically anyone in good health with
1735920	1741520	$50,000 and a few weeks to spare can reach the top of the tallest mountain in the world.
1741520	1746400	What used to be considered the most astounding achievement in human exploration has since been
1746400	1751840	relegated to a neat trophy to brag about at a cocktail party. It's somewhat disheartening to
1751840	1757040	see how even a place as mystifying as Everest eventually found a way to be commodified and
1757040	1763200	commercialized. These days, it seems that there are hardly any frontiers left to explore. As of
1763200	1768880	now, the greatest discoveries reside not in mountains, but in mysteries. We may never know
1768880	1774000	for sure what happened to Mallory and Irvin, but pretty much all of us can be confident about one
1774000	1780480	thing. No one would prefer if they had failed. It's a shame that history only tends to remember
1780480	1786240	the first, because so many other remarkable stories and people get lost in the fold. Whether
1786240	1791280	or not Mallory and Irvin made it to the summit, the fact remains that they both gave their lives
1791280	1796800	trying to push the needle of human achievement. It's chilling to consider someone spending their
1796800	1802240	final moments stranded high above the clouds with no hope of rescue. You can only imagine
1802240	1809200	how lonely it must feel, but in a spiritual sense, the greatest pioneers are never truly alone.
1809200	1815680	While on the precipice of making history, all of mankind is with them. If they were to fail,
1815680	1822320	so would the rest of us. Human beings are defined by challenging the unknown. The innate desire to
1822320	1828400	explore unifies us all. We will not rest until every summit is reached and every question is
1828400	1834720	answered. George Mallory put it rather succinctly back in a 1923 interview for the New York Times.
1835280	1839920	When asked why he wanted to climb Everest, he simply responded with the three most
1839920	1853520	famous words in mountaineering, because it's there.
