1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,640
About an hour after I uploaded the thing video YouTube took it down for a supposed TOS violation

2
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:09,820
They never gave me a specific reason. They just pressed a button and shut it down

3
00:00:10,380 --> 00:00:15,560
While it was up the video was approved for all ads and seemed to be getting pretty heavily recommended

4
00:00:15,560 --> 00:00:19,960
So it didn't appear that any of the metadata in the video was affecting performance

5
00:00:20,040 --> 00:00:26,360
If I had to guess I would assume that the imagery depicted in the film must have tripped off one of YouTube scanners

6
00:00:26,360 --> 00:00:32,760
Regarding graphic content, I guess Rob Bettine's effects were so realistic that they managed to fool YouTube's bots

7
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:41,280
The day before I actually uploaded a nearly identical version of the video while it was unlisted it too got removed for a TOS violation

8
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:44,440
I appealed the takedown and it got restored in about half an hour

9
00:00:44,440 --> 00:00:49,000
I still ended up removing this video anyway, because I found a pretty major editing issue

10
00:00:49,260 --> 00:00:55,880
But I figured after successfully appealing the takedown once the system would at least put me on some kind of white list and not

11
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:59,320
Takedown practically the exact same video just 24 hours later

12
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:08,240
I am now being held hostage for however long it takes a human being to actually review the content as of the time of recording this

13
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:11,480
It's been about three hours and they still haven't looked at my appeal

14
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:16,120
So I'm just gonna have to edit myself in later explaining what ended up happening to the video

15
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:23,760
So this is M from a few hours later and YouTube has finally responded to my appeal the video has been

16
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:27,960
Reinstated with an age restriction. So rather than being dead in the water

17
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:31,160
It's now just barely alive in a vegetative state

18
00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:37,040
Keep in mind when I appealed the original version of this video it got reinstated with no age restriction

19
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:43,880
So it's just another example of YouTube's inconsistency and BS by the way after all this time

20
00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:48,680
I still don't have an explanation as to what exactly is wrong with the video

21
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:52,000
I think it's safe to say that this video just might be cursed

22
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:56,680
I'm just gonna take what I can get at this point. This video has already been taken down twice

23
00:01:56,680 --> 00:02:03,800
So I'm pretty sure re-uploading it will inevitably lead to the same outcome if you're having trouble viewing the age restricted video

24
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:07,440
I uploaded another version to story fire so you can watch it there

25
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:14,860
It's funny to me how I can spend a month writing researching and editing a detailed analysis and it's gonna get less views than this

26
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:20,960
PowerPoint slideshow I made in a day. Maybe this is just YouTube getting revenge on me for tank the rewind

27
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,760
I really don't care at this point

28
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:28,240
I'm moving on to the next project and hopefully YouTube won't also take that down for no reason

29
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:33,420
I guess it goes to show that this film analysis truly was too scary for YouTube

30
00:02:33,860 --> 00:02:36,200
Anyway back to amp from three hours ago

31
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:42,020
The takedown doesn't even make much sense because if you look at YouTube right now

32
00:02:42,020 --> 00:02:48,280
You'll find dozens if not hundreds of other videos reviewing the thing with most of them using the exact same clips

33
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:53,920
The film itself is also available on YouTube for purchase at the end of the day

34
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:56,080
There's really nothing I can even do about it

35
00:02:56,080 --> 00:03:00,700
I'm at the complete mercy of YouTube and have no real power over the situation

36
00:03:00,700 --> 00:03:06,240
I can hope that YouTube does the obvious no-brainer move of reinstating the video

37
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:10,960
But with this site you can never be sure it's honestly just a crapshoot

38
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:15,720
The big irony in this is that in choosing to make a video about a fictional horror story

39
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:20,960
YouTube has reminded me of the very real horror of simply uploading videos to this platform

40
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:25,660
YouTube's automated systems are really no different than the monster from the thing

41
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:30,600
It's an unfeeling inhuman entity that can just obliterate you without a moment's notice

42
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:36,320
Every time I go to upload a video on this platform. I live in fear that something like this could happen

43
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:42,240
It's as if I'm just a hapless victim in a horror movie waiting to get slaughtered over the past few years

44
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:47,440
I've made a good-faith effort to clean up my act and play by the rules and then something like this just

45
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:50,200
Blindsides me and I don't even know what I could have done differently

46
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:56,760
I guess just not talk about a film which dozens of other channels have already discussed on YouTube without any issues

47
00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:00,560
Honestly, I have no idea and with each passing video

48
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:07,120
I get more and more paranoid about what I can and cannot talk about for fear of having this exact situation happen

49
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:12,840
The original title of the video was supposed to be terror in isolation and when it got taken down the first time

50
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:17,560
I thought it had something to do with YouTube's policy on sensitive issues and controversial events

51
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:20,080
I can't even mention the specific term

52
00:04:20,080 --> 00:04:23,860
I'm referring to because I don't even know if it'll get this video taken down, too

53
00:04:23,860 --> 00:04:28,620
I had to go back and forth over whether or not to include the AIDS epidemic in the video

54
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:32,480
It's obviously a very important real-life parallel to the film

55
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:36,760
But testing has shown that mentioning the term can get videos hard demonetized

56
00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:41,520
Of course YouTube never actually gives you a specific reason for any of this

57
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:48,520
So it's just up to you to guess what one thing in this 20-plus minutes of content caused the system to remove your video

58
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:53,640
Are we just not supposed to talk about anything with slightly mature themes?

59
00:04:53,920 --> 00:05:01,800
What I'm trying to do here is provide some nuanced discussion about these complex issues and I can't even begin to do that because

60
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:07,040
Autobot McTakeDown will nuke my video because it detected a word on YouTube's naughty list

61
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:14,100
There are now major historical events that every kid learns about in school that you cannot mention on YouTube

62
00:05:14,100 --> 00:05:17,100
I find it astounding how YouTube's solution to

63
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:24,740
Conspiracy theorists denying these events is to make sure that no one on the platform can discuss them at all as if they truly never happened

64
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:29,020
Needless to say I'm pretty pissed off and disgusted with the state of the site right now

65
00:05:29,300 --> 00:05:36,140
But hey same conversation three years later, I just want to say here that despite the inherent risks involved

66
00:05:36,140 --> 00:05:42,120
I have no plans to dumb down my content into something that's more palatable for YouTube sanitized systems

67
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:48,420
I will not shy away from talking about mature themes and issues if they're relevant to the overall discussion

68
00:05:48,780 --> 00:05:55,080
If YouTube's internal systems have a problem with that then so be it any human being will understand who's in the right

69
00:05:55,080 --> 00:06:00,880
I may be forced to use code words or euphemisms or what-have-you to make sure the videos are seen

70
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:04,200
But I will continue to make the videos I want to make

71
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:12,800
Thankfully, I have the privilege of having consistent sponsorships patreon donations and merchandise sales so that I'm not dependent on YouTube's ad revenue

72
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:18,600
Alone, if you're interested in supporting the content, you can do so through any of these platforms in the meantime

73
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:24,360
I hope all of you can have a happy Halloween. It's probably going to be much less terrifying than mine

74
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:29,960
Oh, by the way, since YouTube killing my last video sort of jeopardized my sponsorship agreement

75
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:32,640
I'm just gonna do another plug for Manscaped here

76
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:39,760
Go to manscaped.com and use code mplemon for 20% off your order plus free international shipping and two free gifts

77
00:06:40,540 --> 00:06:43,440
Also, I gotta give another shout out to the Kino Corner

78
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:46,760
He helped me with the thing video and got his big opportunity ruined

79
00:06:46,900 --> 00:06:51,880
Go check him out if you like film analysis, and I will catch you guys in the next one
