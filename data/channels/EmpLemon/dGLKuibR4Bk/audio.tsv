0	5640	About an hour after I uploaded the thing video YouTube took it down for a supposed TOS violation
5760	9820	They never gave me a specific reason. They just pressed a button and shut it down
10380	15560	While it was up the video was approved for all ads and seemed to be getting pretty heavily recommended
15560	19960	So it didn't appear that any of the metadata in the video was affecting performance
20040	26360	If I had to guess I would assume that the imagery depicted in the film must have tripped off one of YouTube scanners
26360	32760	Regarding graphic content, I guess Rob Bettine's effects were so realistic that they managed to fool YouTube's bots
33120	41280	The day before I actually uploaded a nearly identical version of the video while it was unlisted it too got removed for a TOS violation
41280	44440	I appealed the takedown and it got restored in about half an hour
44440	49000	I still ended up removing this video anyway, because I found a pretty major editing issue
49260	55880	But I figured after successfully appealing the takedown once the system would at least put me on some kind of white list and not
55920	59320	Takedown practically the exact same video just 24 hours later
60120	68240	I am now being held hostage for however long it takes a human being to actually review the content as of the time of recording this
68240	71480	It's been about three hours and they still haven't looked at my appeal
71520	76120	So I'm just gonna have to edit myself in later explaining what ended up happening to the video
77680	83760	So this is M from a few hours later and YouTube has finally responded to my appeal the video has been
84080	87960	Reinstated with an age restriction. So rather than being dead in the water
87960	91160	It's now just barely alive in a vegetative state
91480	97040	Keep in mind when I appealed the original version of this video it got reinstated with no age restriction
97360	103880	So it's just another example of YouTube's inconsistency and BS by the way after all this time
103880	108680	I still don't have an explanation as to what exactly is wrong with the video
108680	112000	I think it's safe to say that this video just might be cursed
112240	116680	I'm just gonna take what I can get at this point. This video has already been taken down twice
116680	123800	So I'm pretty sure re-uploading it will inevitably lead to the same outcome if you're having trouble viewing the age restricted video
123800	127440	I uploaded another version to story fire so you can watch it there
127960	134860	It's funny to me how I can spend a month writing researching and editing a detailed analysis and it's gonna get less views than this
135040	140960	PowerPoint slideshow I made in a day. Maybe this is just YouTube getting revenge on me for tank the rewind
141000	142760	I really don't care at this point
142760	148240	I'm moving on to the next project and hopefully YouTube won't also take that down for no reason
148240	153420	I guess it goes to show that this film analysis truly was too scary for YouTube
153860	156200	Anyway back to amp from three hours ago
157880	162020	The takedown doesn't even make much sense because if you look at YouTube right now
162020	168280	You'll find dozens if not hundreds of other videos reviewing the thing with most of them using the exact same clips
168720	173920	The film itself is also available on YouTube for purchase at the end of the day
173920	176080	There's really nothing I can even do about it
176080	180700	I'm at the complete mercy of YouTube and have no real power over the situation
180700	186240	I can hope that YouTube does the obvious no-brainer move of reinstating the video
186880	190960	But with this site you can never be sure it's honestly just a crapshoot
191400	195720	The big irony in this is that in choosing to make a video about a fictional horror story
196000	200960	YouTube has reminded me of the very real horror of simply uploading videos to this platform
201680	205660	YouTube's automated systems are really no different than the monster from the thing
205680	210600	It's an unfeeling inhuman entity that can just obliterate you without a moment's notice
211440	216320	Every time I go to upload a video on this platform. I live in fear that something like this could happen
216760	222240	It's as if I'm just a hapless victim in a horror movie waiting to get slaughtered over the past few years
222240	227440	I've made a good-faith effort to clean up my act and play by the rules and then something like this just
227640	230200	Blindsides me and I don't even know what I could have done differently
230200	236760	I guess just not talk about a film which dozens of other channels have already discussed on YouTube without any issues
237360	240560	Honestly, I have no idea and with each passing video
240560	247120	I get more and more paranoid about what I can and cannot talk about for fear of having this exact situation happen
247120	252840	The original title of the video was supposed to be terror in isolation and when it got taken down the first time
252840	257560	I thought it had something to do with YouTube's policy on sensitive issues and controversial events
257560	260080	I can't even mention the specific term
260080	263860	I'm referring to because I don't even know if it'll get this video taken down, too
263860	268620	I had to go back and forth over whether or not to include the AIDS epidemic in the video
268760	272480	It's obviously a very important real-life parallel to the film
272600	276760	But testing has shown that mentioning the term can get videos hard demonetized
276760	281520	Of course YouTube never actually gives you a specific reason for any of this
281600	288520	So it's just up to you to guess what one thing in this 20-plus minutes of content caused the system to remove your video
288840	293640	Are we just not supposed to talk about anything with slightly mature themes?
293920	301800	What I'm trying to do here is provide some nuanced discussion about these complex issues and I can't even begin to do that because
302160	307040	Autobot McTakeDown will nuke my video because it detected a word on YouTube's naughty list
307160	314100	There are now major historical events that every kid learns about in school that you cannot mention on YouTube
314100	317100	I find it astounding how YouTube's solution to
317280	324740	Conspiracy theorists denying these events is to make sure that no one on the platform can discuss them at all as if they truly never happened
325120	329020	Needless to say I'm pretty pissed off and disgusted with the state of the site right now
329300	336140	But hey same conversation three years later, I just want to say here that despite the inherent risks involved
336140	342120	I have no plans to dumb down my content into something that's more palatable for YouTube sanitized systems
342120	348420	I will not shy away from talking about mature themes and issues if they're relevant to the overall discussion
348780	355080	If YouTube's internal systems have a problem with that then so be it any human being will understand who's in the right
355080	360880	I may be forced to use code words or euphemisms or what-have-you to make sure the videos are seen
360960	364200	But I will continue to make the videos I want to make
364840	372800	Thankfully, I have the privilege of having consistent sponsorships patreon donations and merchandise sales so that I'm not dependent on YouTube's ad revenue
372800	378600	Alone, if you're interested in supporting the content, you can do so through any of these platforms in the meantime
378600	384360	I hope all of you can have a happy Halloween. It's probably going to be much less terrifying than mine
384360	389960	Oh, by the way, since YouTube killing my last video sort of jeopardized my sponsorship agreement
389960	392640	I'm just gonna do another plug for Manscaped here
392800	399760	Go to manscaped.com and use code mplemon for 20% off your order plus free international shipping and two free gifts
400540	403440	Also, I gotta give another shout out to the Kino Corner
