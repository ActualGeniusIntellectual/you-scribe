0	3120	People of YouTube, it is I, EmperorLemon
3120	7280	and you're gonna have to excuse this video for the lack of visual editing
7280	10160	because I want to get this out quickly
10160	13840	I'm recording this on December 12, 2018
13840	16800	during what should be a very momentous moment
16800	24800	I'm recording this as the 2018 rewind is surpassing Justin Bieber's baby music video
24800	28800	as the YouTube video with the most dislikes on the website
28800	32480	now you may think that the rewind getting so many dislikes
32480	36880	may have something to do with the tank the rewind movement that I started last year
36880	39120	but I'm not going to take credit for any of that
39120	44480	because doing so would be like taking credit for predicting a flood after a hurricane
44480	48400	the tremendous backlash surrounding the YouTube rewind this year
49040	52880	is indicative of a far more pressing problem
52880	54800	whether you realize it or not
54800	59360	we are currently standing at the precipice of the next great YouTube war
60000	64400	it's a war that for all intents and purposes has already begun
64400	67440	and this isn't one of those petty little skirmishes
67440	70880	involving YouTube drama and diss tracks
70880	75280	and topically hating on one YouTuber for making a stupid mistake
75840	78400	this war extends far beyond that
78400	81920	this is a war about the culture of the internet
81920	87840	so allow me to explain to you guys the series of events that has led me to this conclusion
87840	89440	first and foremost
89440	92160	on December 11th 2018
92160	98800	my good friend and fellow YouTuber Mumpke Jones had his two main YouTube channels terminated
98800	105280	each channel Mumpke Jones and Mumpke Jones 2 received three community guidelines strikes
105280	108960	all within a very short time period of each other
108960	113520	one of the strikes the one that ultimately terminated Mumpke's main channel
113520	117280	was done so on a private video with zero views
117840	123840	meaning that this video in particular was not actually flagged by any viewer of Mumpke's videos
123840	128160	and rather it has been terminated by YouTube's own system
128160	132880	and based on this information and the fact that so many of Mumpke's videos
132880	135520	got terminated around the same time
135520	138080	I would say that it's very reasonable to infer
138080	143840	that Mumpke's termination is entirely and solely YouTube's doing
143840	147040	now keep in mind these weren't new videos or anything
147040	150400	these videos had been up on Mumpke's channels for months
150400	152880	some of them were up for over a year
152880	157680	and it just so happens that coincidentally they all get taken down at the same time
157680	160400	and in enough of a volume to terminate Mumpke's channel
160960	163760	Mumpke has been attempting to appeal the decision
163760	167600	he's been having a back and forth with the Team YouTube Twitter account
167600	173600	and so far it appears that YouTube has no intentions of restoring Mumpke's channel
173600	178080	now at this point a lot of you who are familiar with Mumpke's content may be thinking
178080	180880	well Mumpke is a pretty edgy YouTuber
180880	184880	so perhaps it's possible that the videos that got taken down
184880	188160	did actually violate YouTube's guidelines
188160	190080	but the problem with that is it's not true
190640	193520	the videos that got taken down off of Mumpke's channel
193520	195840	were all Elliot Rodger related
195840	201520	and each of them got taken down for reasons of either hate speech or promoting violence
201520	203360	so looking at YouTube's reasoning here
204000	208880	it's first of all very obvious that these videos do not have anything to do
208880	211360	with violating YouTube's hate speech policy
212000	215920	for anyone familiar with Mumpke's recurring series on Elliot Rodger
215920	222480	it is painfully obvious that any possible interpretation of hate in those videos
222480	225360	is directed towards Elliot Rodger
225360	229760	anyone who watches Mumpke's videos on Elliot Rodger could clearly see
229760	233200	that they have nothing to do with hate or discrimination
233200	235840	towards any marginalized group of people
235840	238320	it's totally obvious that they don't
238320	240480	the other reason listed for some of the takedowns
240480	243440	were that they were promoting violent and harmful acts
243440	247600	but once again you don't have to be a genius to watch these videos
247600	252400	and realize that Mumpke Jones is not at all condoning the actions of Elliot Rodger
252640	256000	the videos are presented in a documentary format
256000	261040	and pretty much the only humor in them is done at the expense of Elliot
261040	264800	once again it's painfully obvious to anyone watching these videos
264800	269920	that Mumpke Jones is not promoting the act of mass shootings
269920	272880	as a matter of fact several videos in the series
272880	276080	actively bring up solutions to how mass shootings
276080	280160	like the one perpetrated by Elliot Rodger could have been prevented
280240	283680	another important detail that I'd like to add about this case
283680	288320	is that the privatized video on Mumpke's channel that ultimately led to his third strike
288320	294960	was a short two-minute long skit of Mumpke basically screwing around with an Elliot Rodger body pillow
294960	299040	and as a matter of fact an identical version of that video
299040	301840	had been uploaded to Rusty Cage's channel
301840	304720	considering those two collaborated on the project
304720	308240	so just to be clear here Mumpke Jones and Rusty Cage
308240	312240	both uploaded two versions of the same video
312240	316400	Mumpke's video got taken down that led to his channel termination
316400	319760	and the video on Rusty Cage's channel was completely unaffected
319760	324400	when Mumpke Jones then linked the Rusty Cage video to Team YouTube
324400	328800	showing them that the video had been wrongfully taken down on Mumpke's channel
328800	331440	YouTube decided to double down on their decision
331440	335920	and take down the Rusty Cage version of the video and give his channel a strike
335920	339360	YouTube's reasoning for this is that the video promotes violent acts
339360	344400	even though there is zero violent or graphic content in the video
344400	349360	the only possible interpretation that could even slightly lead to this conclusion
349360	352160	is the inclusion of Elliot Rodger
352160	357360	and based on the fact that pretty much every video that was terminated from Mumpke's two channels
357360	359200	were Elliot Rodger related
359200	364400	it becomes clear that YouTube has some vendetta against Elliot Rodger content
364400	367520	Mumpke's termination and Rusty getting a strike
367520	373120	are almost certainly the result of YouTube's internal people pulling some strings
373120	378400	because if YouTube actually cared about taking down violent and graphic content
378400	383040	then they should probably explain to me how a plane crash compilation
383040	389280	showing the actual violent deaths of hundreds of people is allowed to stay up on the platform
389280	393920	and for most of its lifetime by the way it was running ads on the platform
393920	399280	it's currently at over 25 million views and YouTube has done nothing about it
399280	403280	maybe YouTube should explain how they've allowed an entire sub-genre
403280	406160	of women pretending to have miscarriages
406160	410880	and have done nothing to prevent this violent and graphic content
410880	413920	just a reminder to you guys that miscarriage pranks
413920	418080	and plane crash compilations are a-okay according to YouTube
418080	423040	but Mumpke Jones dancing around in his backyard with an Elliot Rodger body pillow
423040	426720	is somehow too violent and graphic to stay up on the platform
426720	429680	when you consider all these factors it becomes painfully obvious
429680	435040	that this isn't about some YouTuber uploading videos of a school shooter and getting banned
435040	438720	it has become painfully clear that people like Mumpke Jones
438720	444960	and people like Rusty Cage are not welcome on the platform according to YouTube
444960	448880	it doesn't matter how many fans love and support their content
448880	451920	and watch ads and generate revenue for YouTube
451920	458720	it doesn't matter how content like this was thriving on the platform just two years ago
458720	465360	it has become painfully clear that YouTube views alternative edgy channels like Mumpke Jones
465360	469920	as a threat to their image and they want channels like that removed
469920	474320	regardless of how many individuals and fans get ripped off
475280	496240	And with that being said, I think the real question on everyone's mind
496240	501440	is why would YouTube, a company that thrived on edgy and alternative content
501440	504800	during the entire time it was growing as a platform
504800	509440	why would a company like that suddenly care so much about expunging the site
509440	513840	of the entire genre of content that popularized them
513840	519360	and let me tell you folks, the answer to this is the very thing I brought up at the beginning of this show
519360	522880	we are currently embroiled in a culture war
522880	527520	and YouTube has decided that Mumpke Jones is on the wrong side of it
527520	529520	allow me to explain this further
529600	532240	in the first week of December 2018
532240	539680	PewDiePie launched a campaign that raised over $200,000 for children in India
539680	544720	$200,000 plus raised and donated to charity instantly
544720	548480	of course all of you probably know that PewDiePie is currently in the middle
548480	551600	of the great subscriber battle versus T-series
551600	557760	and this is an event that's one of the most incredible awe-inspiring things I've ever seen as a YouTuber
557760	563120	it's an event that's unifying the entire YouTube community behind PewDiePie
563120	567360	the channel that everyone who makes YouTube content loves and respects
567360	571600	and as some of you know this whole movement has caused PewDiePie to gain a ton of subscribers
571600	573200	over the past couple of months
573200	579840	so PewDiePie, like the charitable guy he is, decides to share this newfound subscriber boost
579840	585280	with small YouTubers who he felt deserved it out of the goodness of his heart
585280	586480	so keep these in mind
586480	592320	two events PewDiePie raises and donates $200,000 to Indian kids
592320	596800	PewDiePie, to show his gratitude to the YouTube community rallying around him
596800	601200	decides to shout out dozens of small YouTube channels
601200	603760	now I don't know about you, but if you ask me
603760	607040	these sound like the actions of a pretty good dude
607040	612560	so based on these two events, how do you think the online news media reacted to it?
612560	616240	well shit they're calling him a fucking racist and a fucking Nazi
616240	619520	just like they've been doing for the past year and a half
619520	626960	publication after publication reporting that PewDiePie shouts out a racist Nazi channel
626960	630560	oh what's this PewDiePie donates $200,000 to kids in India
630560	633520	crickets, nothing, you don't hear a peep about it
633520	637440	from the fucking blue checkmark so-called online journalists
637440	641520	oh but PewDiePie shouts out a channel that sometimes makes edgy jokes
641520	645200	oh sound the Nazi alarm we found ourselves another Nazi
645200	650960	I can't believe it you guys PewDiePie wants minorities to die in a hellfire
650960	654240	and it's not just one or two publications reporting on this
654240	656320	it's all the online publications
656320	661600	all going after PewDiePie having him and the word racist in the same headline
661600	666240	just a week after PewDiePie raised $200,000 for kids in India
666240	670160	and then you got blue checkmark cocksuckers like Joe Bernstein
670160	674880	trying to piggyback off the controversy and producing blatantly deceptive posts
674880	678880	quote-unquote reporting about the PewDiePie controversy
678880	681120	hey man I really appreciate your content
681120	683920	you've gotten me through some tough times and I respect the
688640	693440	and then when it gets called out on his obvious deceptive reporting
693440	696560	he just calls all of his opponents triggered
696560	697760	well isn't that nice Joe
698320	700240	I want to be totally straightforward with you
701120	705040	you will you will never in a million years
705760	710640	get a job at a publication as prestigious as the New York Times
711680	715440	that will that little pipe dream is never gonna happen
716080	722080	you will be blogging and tweeting until you are dead and nobody will care
723440	726880	nobody will ever read anything you wrote and say to themselves
727920	732720	this is important I need to know more about this
732720	735920	nobody's ever going to read a page that you wrote
735920	738400	and say to themselves damn I'm glad I read that
738400	740800	they're just gonna it's just fucking popcorn
740800	743920	you write the mental equivalent of popcorn
743920	744960	white male
744960	747520	I agree with that
748240	751280	and this is the thing I want to talk about most in this video
751280	754560	what happened to Mumpke and what happened to PewDiePie this week
754640	757360	are both aspects of the same thing
757920	764960	both PewDiePie and Mumpke were subject to coordinated attacks by cultural opponents
764960	767200	as each day goes on on the internet
767200	772480	it's becoming painfully obvious that the internet has now separated into two groups
772480	774080	there's people that get it
774080	777120	there's people that understand internet culture
777120	778640	and then there's everybody else
778640	783360	there's the deadbeat generation of millennials who know how to use the internet
783360	785920	but don't actually get the internet
785920	791280	you have this group of people who thinks that the internet is nothing more than Netflix and cat pictures
791280	795680	and hey guess what these people are running all the online news publications
795680	797520	and they're running youtube
797520	802480	you want to know why youtube rewind this year was an unmitigated disaster
802480	806560	and resembled a pile of steaming horse droppings
806560	812160	well it would seem that the people in charge of it don't actually understand the culture of youtube
812160	817120	and they're just a little bit out of touch with what youtubers actually want
817120	820080	and that brings me to the ultimate point of this video
820080	826960	youtube and the news media have teamed up to attack and deplatform their cultural opponents
826960	833440	in an attempt to engineer and transform the culture of youtube into something they deem fit
833440	839040	i saw this coming back in july when youtube teamed up with the legacy news media
839040	841840	it shouldn't be much of a coincidence that after that point
841840	846000	whenever something bad happens on youtube it's never youtube's fault
846000	849920	it's always the evil racist youtuber who's the problem
849920	853360	and needs to be deplatformed and have their channel terminated
853360	857680	and get called anti-semitic by every publication under the sun
857680	862240	and by every time you retweet one of these things or every time you promote this idea
863040	869760	you are promoting ignorance racism genocide anti-semitism
870560	875440	these are all things that you are putting forward when you are doing anything that promotes pewdiepie
876240	881200	so be careful about this if someone decided that if something were to happen if pewdiepie were to
881200	886960	be sued for this you could be complicit if you retweet it they could make you pay a fine as well
887040	893840	because you have officially published anti-semitic things so if you are republishing this stuff you
893840	899280	could get in trouble for it this is a message to everyone listening to this right now we are at
899280	906000	war the people in charge of these publications and this website have retracted themselves into
906000	912560	an ideological bubble and they are attempting to expunge this website of any influential person
912560	917920	who doesn't fit into their utopian vision of the site call me a conspiracy theorist if you will
917920	924880	but when you witness two attacks one right after the other so coordinated and so absolutely wrong
924880	930800	and unfair in their approach something is going on the youtubers have rebelled against this year's
930800	937200	youtube rewind literally as i was recording this it has become the most disliked video of all time
937200	943360	the youtube community has completely rejected youtube sanitized and pc version of the youtube
943360	950080	rewind and frankly we're not going to stand for it anymore we as a youtube community need to unite
950080	955120	against this threat i don't want to hear it if you don't like mumke i don't want to hear it
955120	960880	if you don't like pewdiepie if you in any way support the termination of mumke or the smear
960880	965840	campaign against pewdiepie i got news for you buddy you're next they're going to be coming for
965840	971440	all of us next and we need to stick by each other and have each other's backs to make sure that
971440	977040	whoever youtube and the news media decide to target next as a part of their agenda isn't going
977040	982400	to be forced to disappear it's time to put aside our differences it's time to forgive the logan
982400	989200	pauls forgive the rice gums and defend ourselves from this much greater problem it could be you
989840	998080	it could be me that specific video violated our policies on harmful slash dangerous content
999040	1003040	so this was supposed to be the part of the video where i tell you guys to subscribe to
1003040	1009280	mumke's new channel but unfortunately youtube saved me the trouble by banning all of mumke's
1009280	1015760	remaining accounts at this stage mumke appears to be completely banned from youtube the fact
1015760	1022320	that youtube has doubled down so hard on banning a channel that is so clearly innocent from what
1022320	1029200	they're accusing him is absolutely outrageous and i cannot reiterate enough how horrific of a
1029200	1033840	precedent this sets for youtube youtube is basically saying that they can go behind the
1033840	1039280	scenes and delete any channel they want with impunity and completely circumvent any system
1039280	1045520	of due process since mumke's deletion other decently sized youtube channels have also
1045520	1051920	been deleted for seemingly no reason in all eight years of making videos on this platform i have
1051920	1057920	never seen a situation as potentially dangerous as this one where at least in the past it seems
1057920	1063040	like you had to make a ton of people mad to false flag your videos and take down your channel now
1063120	1069920	all it takes is one single person at youtube who doesn't like you to completely destroy your youtube
1069920	1075200	career now in the time since mumke's ban a few people like tim pool have come out to report on
1075200	1080560	the story but other than that there's been a shocking lack of concern over what's happened
1080560	1086320	here i really don't think youtubers are treating this as seriously as they can and like i said
1086320	1092160	earlier it shouldn't even matter if you don't like mumke or if you thought his termination was
1092160	1098560	justified the fact that we are simply giving youtube the power to terminate any channel they
1098560	1105200	want with no due process is terrifying and everyone out there who even cares a smidge
1105200	1111600	about this website should be completely up in arms about mumke's takedown this isn't an issue
1111600	1118640	just affecting mumke this is an issue affecting every single person on youtube it doesn't matter
1118640	1124320	if you think you're following the rules mumke thought he was following the rules many of his
1124320	1131200	videos that got taken down were so called manually approved as ad friendly your channel termination
1131200	1138080	could come from out of nowhere with no warning for no reason and there will be nothing you can do
1138080	1143600	about it it's clear that youtube isn't doing this because they actually want to enforce guidelines
1143600	1149200	last time i checked the plane crash compilation is still online even after youtube claimed to
1149200	1156400	remove 58 million infringing videos this is about the unfair targeting of individual people this is
1156400	1162720	a threat to potentially every creator on the platform and it must not be ignored in a just
1162720	1168240	world mumke would have all of his channels restored but based on some of the slimy stuff
1168240	1173520	this website has perpetrated in the past year i'm not sure that's gonna happen so in the meantime
1173680	1179360	make sure you follow mumke on twitch because youtube is too authoritarian to let him stay here
1179360	1183840	i really hope they don't ban me for even advertising anything on twitch because they've
1183840	1189200	done it before also if you want to have a look at the last place on youtube where mumke isn't banned
