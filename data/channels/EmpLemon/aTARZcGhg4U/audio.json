{"text": " People of YouTube, it is I, EmperorLemon and you're gonna have to excuse this video for the lack of visual editing because I want to get this out quickly I'm recording this on December 12, 2018 during what should be a very momentous moment I'm recording this as the 2018 rewind is surpassing Justin Bieber's baby music video as the YouTube video with the most dislikes on the website now you may think that the rewind getting so many dislikes may have something to do with the tank the rewind movement that I started last year but I'm not going to take credit for any of that because doing so would be like taking credit for predicting a flood after a hurricane the tremendous backlash surrounding the YouTube rewind this year is indicative of a far more pressing problem whether you realize it or not we are currently standing at the precipice of the next great YouTube war it's a war that for all intents and purposes has already begun and this isn't one of those petty little skirmishes involving YouTube drama and diss tracks and topically hating on one YouTuber for making a stupid mistake this war extends far beyond that this is a war about the culture of the internet so allow me to explain to you guys the series of events that has led me to this conclusion first and foremost on December 11th 2018 my good friend and fellow YouTuber Mumpke Jones had his two main YouTube channels terminated each channel Mumpke Jones and Mumpke Jones 2 received three community guidelines strikes all within a very short time period of each other one of the strikes the one that ultimately terminated Mumpke's main channel was done so on a private video with zero views meaning that this video in particular was not actually flagged by any viewer of Mumpke's videos and rather it has been terminated by YouTube's own system and based on this information and the fact that so many of Mumpke's videos got terminated around the same time I would say that it's very reasonable to infer that Mumpke's termination is entirely and solely YouTube's doing now keep in mind these weren't new videos or anything these videos had been up on Mumpke's channels for months some of them were up for over a year and it just so happens that coincidentally they all get taken down at the same time and in enough of a volume to terminate Mumpke's channel Mumpke has been attempting to appeal the decision he's been having a back and forth with the Team YouTube Twitter account and so far it appears that YouTube has no intentions of restoring Mumpke's channel now at this point a lot of you who are familiar with Mumpke's content may be thinking well Mumpke is a pretty edgy YouTuber so perhaps it's possible that the videos that got taken down did actually violate YouTube's guidelines but the problem with that is it's not true the videos that got taken down off of Mumpke's channel were all Elliot Rodger related and each of them got taken down for reasons of either hate speech or promoting violence so looking at YouTube's reasoning here it's first of all very obvious that these videos do not have anything to do with violating YouTube's hate speech policy for anyone familiar with Mumpke's recurring series on Elliot Rodger it is painfully obvious that any possible interpretation of hate in those videos is directed towards Elliot Rodger anyone who watches Mumpke's videos on Elliot Rodger could clearly see that they have nothing to do with hate or discrimination towards any marginalized group of people it's totally obvious that they don't the other reason listed for some of the takedowns were that they were promoting violent and harmful acts but once again you don't have to be a genius to watch these videos and realize that Mumpke Jones is not at all condoning the actions of Elliot Rodger the videos are presented in a documentary format and pretty much the only humor in them is done at the expense of Elliot once again it's painfully obvious to anyone watching these videos that Mumpke Jones is not promoting the act of mass shootings as a matter of fact several videos in the series actively bring up solutions to how mass shootings like the one perpetrated by Elliot Rodger could have been prevented another important detail that I'd like to add about this case is that the privatized video on Mumpke's channel that ultimately led to his third strike was a short two-minute long skit of Mumpke basically screwing around with an Elliot Rodger body pillow and as a matter of fact an identical version of that video had been uploaded to Rusty Cage's channel considering those two collaborated on the project so just to be clear here Mumpke Jones and Rusty Cage both uploaded two versions of the same video Mumpke's video got taken down that led to his channel termination and the video on Rusty Cage's channel was completely unaffected when Mumpke Jones then linked the Rusty Cage video to Team YouTube showing them that the video had been wrongfully taken down on Mumpke's channel YouTube decided to double down on their decision and take down the Rusty Cage version of the video and give his channel a strike YouTube's reasoning for this is that the video promotes violent acts even though there is zero violent or graphic content in the video the only possible interpretation that could even slightly lead to this conclusion is the inclusion of Elliot Rodger and based on the fact that pretty much every video that was terminated from Mumpke's two channels were Elliot Rodger related it becomes clear that YouTube has some vendetta against Elliot Rodger content Mumpke's termination and Rusty getting a strike are almost certainly the result of YouTube's internal people pulling some strings because if YouTube actually cared about taking down violent and graphic content then they should probably explain to me how a plane crash compilation showing the actual violent deaths of hundreds of people is allowed to stay up on the platform and for most of its lifetime by the way it was running ads on the platform it's currently at over 25 million views and YouTube has done nothing about it maybe YouTube should explain how they've allowed an entire sub-genre of women pretending to have miscarriages and have done nothing to prevent this violent and graphic content just a reminder to you guys that miscarriage pranks and plane crash compilations are a-okay according to YouTube but Mumpke Jones dancing around in his backyard with an Elliot Rodger body pillow is somehow too violent and graphic to stay up on the platform when you consider all these factors it becomes painfully obvious that this isn't about some YouTuber uploading videos of a school shooter and getting banned it has become painfully clear that people like Mumpke Jones and people like Rusty Cage are not welcome on the platform according to YouTube it doesn't matter how many fans love and support their content and watch ads and generate revenue for YouTube it doesn't matter how content like this was thriving on the platform just two years ago it has become painfully clear that YouTube views alternative edgy channels like Mumpke Jones as a threat to their image and they want channels like that removed regardless of how many individuals and fans get ripped off And with that being said, I think the real question on everyone's mind is why would YouTube, a company that thrived on edgy and alternative content during the entire time it was growing as a platform why would a company like that suddenly care so much about expunging the site of the entire genre of content that popularized them and let me tell you folks, the answer to this is the very thing I brought up at the beginning of this show we are currently embroiled in a culture war and YouTube has decided that Mumpke Jones is on the wrong side of it allow me to explain this further in the first week of December 2018 PewDiePie launched a campaign that raised over $200,000 for children in India $200,000 plus raised and donated to charity instantly of course all of you probably know that PewDiePie is currently in the middle of the great subscriber battle versus T-series and this is an event that's one of the most incredible awe-inspiring things I've ever seen as a YouTuber it's an event that's unifying the entire YouTube community behind PewDiePie the channel that everyone who makes YouTube content loves and respects and as some of you know this whole movement has caused PewDiePie to gain a ton of subscribers over the past couple of months so PewDiePie, like the charitable guy he is, decides to share this newfound subscriber boost with small YouTubers who he felt deserved it out of the goodness of his heart so keep these in mind two events PewDiePie raises and donates $200,000 to Indian kids PewDiePie, to show his gratitude to the YouTube community rallying around him decides to shout out dozens of small YouTube channels now I don't know about you, but if you ask me these sound like the actions of a pretty good dude so based on these two events, how do you think the online news media reacted to it? well shit they're calling him a fucking racist and a fucking Nazi just like they've been doing for the past year and a half publication after publication reporting that PewDiePie shouts out a racist Nazi channel oh what's this PewDiePie donates $200,000 to kids in India crickets, nothing, you don't hear a peep about it from the fucking blue checkmark so-called online journalists oh but PewDiePie shouts out a channel that sometimes makes edgy jokes oh sound the Nazi alarm we found ourselves another Nazi I can't believe it you guys PewDiePie wants minorities to die in a hellfire and it's not just one or two publications reporting on this it's all the online publications all going after PewDiePie having him and the word racist in the same headline just a week after PewDiePie raised $200,000 for kids in India and then you got blue checkmark cocksuckers like Joe Bernstein trying to piggyback off the controversy and producing blatantly deceptive posts quote-unquote reporting about the PewDiePie controversy hey man I really appreciate your content you've gotten me through some tough times and I respect the and then when it gets called out on his obvious deceptive reporting he just calls all of his opponents triggered well isn't that nice Joe I want to be totally straightforward with you you will you will never in a million years get a job at a publication as prestigious as the New York Times that will that little pipe dream is never gonna happen you will be blogging and tweeting until you are dead and nobody will care nobody will ever read anything you wrote and say to themselves this is important I need to know more about this nobody's ever going to read a page that you wrote and say to themselves damn I'm glad I read that they're just gonna it's just fucking popcorn you write the mental equivalent of popcorn white male I agree with that and this is the thing I want to talk about most in this video what happened to Mumpke and what happened to PewDiePie this week are both aspects of the same thing both PewDiePie and Mumpke were subject to coordinated attacks by cultural opponents as each day goes on on the internet it's becoming painfully obvious that the internet has now separated into two groups there's people that get it there's people that understand internet culture and then there's everybody else there's the deadbeat generation of millennials who know how to use the internet but don't actually get the internet you have this group of people who thinks that the internet is nothing more than Netflix and cat pictures and hey guess what these people are running all the online news publications and they're running youtube you want to know why youtube rewind this year was an unmitigated disaster and resembled a pile of steaming horse droppings well it would seem that the people in charge of it don't actually understand the culture of youtube and they're just a little bit out of touch with what youtubers actually want and that brings me to the ultimate point of this video youtube and the news media have teamed up to attack and deplatform their cultural opponents in an attempt to engineer and transform the culture of youtube into something they deem fit i saw this coming back in july when youtube teamed up with the legacy news media it shouldn't be much of a coincidence that after that point whenever something bad happens on youtube it's never youtube's fault it's always the evil racist youtuber who's the problem and needs to be deplatformed and have their channel terminated and get called anti-semitic by every publication under the sun and by every time you retweet one of these things or every time you promote this idea you are promoting ignorance racism genocide anti-semitism these are all things that you are putting forward when you are doing anything that promotes pewdiepie so be careful about this if someone decided that if something were to happen if pewdiepie were to be sued for this you could be complicit if you retweet it they could make you pay a fine as well because you have officially published anti-semitic things so if you are republishing this stuff you could get in trouble for it this is a message to everyone listening to this right now we are at war the people in charge of these publications and this website have retracted themselves into an ideological bubble and they are attempting to expunge this website of any influential person who doesn't fit into their utopian vision of the site call me a conspiracy theorist if you will but when you witness two attacks one right after the other so coordinated and so absolutely wrong and unfair in their approach something is going on the youtubers have rebelled against this year's youtube rewind literally as i was recording this it has become the most disliked video of all time the youtube community has completely rejected youtube sanitized and pc version of the youtube rewind and frankly we're not going to stand for it anymore we as a youtube community need to unite against this threat i don't want to hear it if you don't like mumke i don't want to hear it if you don't like pewdiepie if you in any way support the termination of mumke or the smear campaign against pewdiepie i got news for you buddy you're next they're going to be coming for all of us next and we need to stick by each other and have each other's backs to make sure that whoever youtube and the news media decide to target next as a part of their agenda isn't going to be forced to disappear it's time to put aside our differences it's time to forgive the logan pauls forgive the rice gums and defend ourselves from this much greater problem it could be you it could be me that specific video violated our policies on harmful slash dangerous content so this was supposed to be the part of the video where i tell you guys to subscribe to mumke's new channel but unfortunately youtube saved me the trouble by banning all of mumke's remaining accounts at this stage mumke appears to be completely banned from youtube the fact that youtube has doubled down so hard on banning a channel that is so clearly innocent from what they're accusing him is absolutely outrageous and i cannot reiterate enough how horrific of a precedent this sets for youtube youtube is basically saying that they can go behind the scenes and delete any channel they want with impunity and completely circumvent any system of due process since mumke's deletion other decently sized youtube channels have also been deleted for seemingly no reason in all eight years of making videos on this platform i have never seen a situation as potentially dangerous as this one where at least in the past it seems like you had to make a ton of people mad to false flag your videos and take down your channel now all it takes is one single person at youtube who doesn't like you to completely destroy your youtube career now in the time since mumke's ban a few people like tim pool have come out to report on the story but other than that there's been a shocking lack of concern over what's happened here i really don't think youtubers are treating this as seriously as they can and like i said earlier it shouldn't even matter if you don't like mumke or if you thought his termination was justified the fact that we are simply giving youtube the power to terminate any channel they want with no due process is terrifying and everyone out there who even cares a smidge about this website should be completely up in arms about mumke's takedown this isn't an issue just affecting mumke this is an issue affecting every single person on youtube it doesn't matter if you think you're following the rules mumke thought he was following the rules many of his videos that got taken down were so called manually approved as ad friendly your channel termination could come from out of nowhere with no warning for no reason and there will be nothing you can do about it it's clear that youtube isn't doing this because they actually want to enforce guidelines last time i checked the plane crash compilation is still online even after youtube claimed to remove 58 million infringing videos this is about the unfair targeting of individual people this is a threat to potentially every creator on the platform and it must not be ignored in a just world mumke would have all of his channels restored but based on some of the slimy stuff this website has perpetrated in the past year i'm not sure that's gonna happen so in the meantime make sure you follow mumke on twitch because youtube is too authoritarian to let him stay here i really hope they don't ban me for even advertising anything on twitch because they've done it before also if you want to have a look at the last place on youtube where mumke isn't banned you can check out the state of the youtube podcast also featuring me and rusty cage the only reason this channel hasn't also been banned is because mumke doesn't own it but hey i wouldn't put it past youtube to unfairly take this down too fuck this website and now please enjoy some patron sponsored content hey guys this is babalu productions i'm a small youtuber that makes cartoons i do random skits and things like that if you guys could check out my channel that would be greatly appreciated or you can go to pornhub instead i mean if you do i don't blame you midget porn is a lot more appealing than my videos will ever be because they look like they were made in powerpoint but why not both the link to my newest video called if ea made a dildo featuring the act man is down below check it out if you've got time and finally thank you to emperor lemon for giving me a chance to be here", "segments": [{"id": 0, "seek": 0, "start": 0.0, "end": 3.12, "text": "
