1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,120
People of YouTube, it is I, EmperorLemon

2
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:07,280
and you're gonna have to excuse this video for the lack of visual editing

3
00:00:07,280 --> 00:00:10,160
because I want to get this out quickly

4
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:13,840
I'm recording this on December 12, 2018

5
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:16,800
during what should be a very momentous moment

6
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:24,800
I'm recording this as the 2018 rewind is surpassing Justin Bieber's baby music video

7
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:28,800
as the YouTube video with the most dislikes on the website

8
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:32,480
now you may think that the rewind getting so many dislikes

9
00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:36,880
may have something to do with the tank the rewind movement that I started last year

10
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:39,120
but I'm not going to take credit for any of that

11
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:44,480
because doing so would be like taking credit for predicting a flood after a hurricane

12
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:48,400
the tremendous backlash surrounding the YouTube rewind this year

13
00:00:49,040 --> 00:00:52,880
is indicative of a far more pressing problem

14
00:00:52,880 --> 00:00:54,800
whether you realize it or not

15
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:59,360
we are currently standing at the precipice of the next great YouTube war

16
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,400
it's a war that for all intents and purposes has already begun

17
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:07,440
and this isn't one of those petty little skirmishes

18
00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:10,880
involving YouTube drama and diss tracks

19
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:15,280
and topically hating on one YouTuber for making a stupid mistake

20
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:18,400
this war extends far beyond that

21
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:21,920
this is a war about the culture of the internet

22
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:27,840
so allow me to explain to you guys the series of events that has led me to this conclusion

23
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:29,440
first and foremost

24
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:32,160
on December 11th 2018

25
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:38,800
my good friend and fellow YouTuber Mumpke Jones had his two main YouTube channels terminated

26
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:45,280
each channel Mumpke Jones and Mumpke Jones 2 received three community guidelines strikes

27
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:48,960
all within a very short time period of each other

28
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:53,520
one of the strikes the one that ultimately terminated Mumpke's main channel

29
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:57,280
was done so on a private video with zero views

30
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:03,840
meaning that this video in particular was not actually flagged by any viewer of Mumpke's videos

31
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:08,160
and rather it has been terminated by YouTube's own system

32
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:12,880
and based on this information and the fact that so many of Mumpke's videos

33
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:15,520
got terminated around the same time

34
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:18,080
I would say that it's very reasonable to infer

35
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:23,840
that Mumpke's termination is entirely and solely YouTube's doing

36
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:27,040
now keep in mind these weren't new videos or anything

37
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:30,400
these videos had been up on Mumpke's channels for months

38
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:32,880
some of them were up for over a year

39
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:37,680
and it just so happens that coincidentally they all get taken down at the same time

40
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:40,400
and in enough of a volume to terminate Mumpke's channel

41
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:43,760
Mumpke has been attempting to appeal the decision

42
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:47,600
he's been having a back and forth with the Team YouTube Twitter account

43
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:53,600
and so far it appears that YouTube has no intentions of restoring Mumpke's channel

44
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:58,080
now at this point a lot of you who are familiar with Mumpke's content may be thinking

45
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:00,880
well Mumpke is a pretty edgy YouTuber

46
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:04,880
so perhaps it's possible that the videos that got taken down

47
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:08,160
did actually violate YouTube's guidelines

48
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:10,080
but the problem with that is it's not true

49
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:13,520
the videos that got taken down off of Mumpke's channel

50
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:15,840
were all Elliot Rodger related

51
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:21,520
and each of them got taken down for reasons of either hate speech or promoting violence

52
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:23,360
so looking at YouTube's reasoning here

53
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:28,880
it's first of all very obvious that these videos do not have anything to do

54
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:31,360
with violating YouTube's hate speech policy

55
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,920
for anyone familiar with Mumpke's recurring series on Elliot Rodger

56
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:42,480
it is painfully obvious that any possible interpretation of hate in those videos

57
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:45,360
is directed towards Elliot Rodger

58
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:49,760
anyone who watches Mumpke's videos on Elliot Rodger could clearly see

59
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:53,200
that they have nothing to do with hate or discrimination

60
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:55,840
towards any marginalized group of people

61
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:58,320
it's totally obvious that they don't

62
00:03:58,320 --> 00:04:00,480
the other reason listed for some of the takedowns

63
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:03,440
were that they were promoting violent and harmful acts

64
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:07,600
but once again you don't have to be a genius to watch these videos

65
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:12,400
and realize that Mumpke Jones is not at all condoning the actions of Elliot Rodger

66
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:16,000
the videos are presented in a documentary format

67
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:21,040
and pretty much the only humor in them is done at the expense of Elliot

68
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:24,800
once again it's painfully obvious to anyone watching these videos

69
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:29,920
that Mumpke Jones is not promoting the act of mass shootings

70
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:32,880
as a matter of fact several videos in the series

71
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:36,080
actively bring up solutions to how mass shootings

72
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:40,160
like the one perpetrated by Elliot Rodger could have been prevented

73
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:43,680
another important detail that I'd like to add about this case

74
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:48,320
is that the privatized video on Mumpke's channel that ultimately led to his third strike

75
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:54,960
was a short two-minute long skit of Mumpke basically screwing around with an Elliot Rodger body pillow

76
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:59,040
and as a matter of fact an identical version of that video

77
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:01,840
had been uploaded to Rusty Cage's channel

78
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:04,720
considering those two collaborated on the project

79
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:08,240
so just to be clear here Mumpke Jones and Rusty Cage

80
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:12,240
both uploaded two versions of the same video

81
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:16,400
Mumpke's video got taken down that led to his channel termination

82
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:19,760
and the video on Rusty Cage's channel was completely unaffected

83
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:24,400
when Mumpke Jones then linked the Rusty Cage video to Team YouTube

84
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:28,800
showing them that the video had been wrongfully taken down on Mumpke's channel

85
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:31,440
YouTube decided to double down on their decision

86
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:35,920
and take down the Rusty Cage version of the video and give his channel a strike

87
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:39,360
YouTube's reasoning for this is that the video promotes violent acts

88
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:44,400
even though there is zero violent or graphic content in the video

89
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:49,360
the only possible interpretation that could even slightly lead to this conclusion

90
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:52,160
is the inclusion of Elliot Rodger

91
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:57,360
and based on the fact that pretty much every video that was terminated from Mumpke's two channels

92
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:59,200
were Elliot Rodger related

93
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:04,400
it becomes clear that YouTube has some vendetta against Elliot Rodger content

94
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:07,520
Mumpke's termination and Rusty getting a strike

95
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:13,120
are almost certainly the result of YouTube's internal people pulling some strings

96
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:18,400
because if YouTube actually cared about taking down violent and graphic content

97
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:23,040
then they should probably explain to me how a plane crash compilation

98
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:29,280
showing the actual violent deaths of hundreds of people is allowed to stay up on the platform

99
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:33,920
and for most of its lifetime by the way it was running ads on the platform

100
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:39,280
it's currently at over 25 million views and YouTube has done nothing about it

101
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:43,280
maybe YouTube should explain how they've allowed an entire sub-genre

102
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:46,160
of women pretending to have miscarriages

103
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:50,880
and have done nothing to prevent this violent and graphic content

104
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:53,920
just a reminder to you guys that miscarriage pranks

105
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:58,080
and plane crash compilations are a-okay according to YouTube

106
00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:03,040
but Mumpke Jones dancing around in his backyard with an Elliot Rodger body pillow

107
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:06,720
is somehow too violent and graphic to stay up on the platform

108
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:09,680
when you consider all these factors it becomes painfully obvious

109
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:15,040
that this isn't about some YouTuber uploading videos of a school shooter and getting banned

110
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:18,720
it has become painfully clear that people like Mumpke Jones

111
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:24,960
and people like Rusty Cage are not welcome on the platform according to YouTube

112
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:28,880
it doesn't matter how many fans love and support their content

113
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:31,920
and watch ads and generate revenue for YouTube

114
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:38,720
it doesn't matter how content like this was thriving on the platform just two years ago

115
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:45,360
it has become painfully clear that YouTube views alternative edgy channels like Mumpke Jones

116
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:49,920
as a threat to their image and they want channels like that removed

117
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:54,320
regardless of how many individuals and fans get ripped off

118
00:07:55,280 --> 00:08:16,240
And with that being said, I think the real question on everyone's mind

119
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:21,440
is why would YouTube, a company that thrived on edgy and alternative content

120
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:24,800
during the entire time it was growing as a platform

121
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:29,440
why would a company like that suddenly care so much about expunging the site

122
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:33,840
of the entire genre of content that popularized them

123
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:39,360
and let me tell you folks, the answer to this is the very thing I brought up at the beginning of this show

124
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:42,880
we are currently embroiled in a culture war

125
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:47,520
and YouTube has decided that Mumpke Jones is on the wrong side of it

126
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:49,520
allow me to explain this further

127
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:52,240
in the first week of December 2018

128
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:59,680
PewDiePie launched a campaign that raised over $200,000 for children in India

129
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:04,720
$200,000 plus raised and donated to charity instantly

130
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:08,480
of course all of you probably know that PewDiePie is currently in the middle

131
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:11,600
of the great subscriber battle versus T-series

132
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:17,760
and this is an event that's one of the most incredible awe-inspiring things I've ever seen as a YouTuber

133
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:23,120
it's an event that's unifying the entire YouTube community behind PewDiePie

134
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:27,360
the channel that everyone who makes YouTube content loves and respects

135
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:31,600
and as some of you know this whole movement has caused PewDiePie to gain a ton of subscribers

136
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:33,200
over the past couple of months

137
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:39,840
so PewDiePie, like the charitable guy he is, decides to share this newfound subscriber boost

138
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:45,280
with small YouTubers who he felt deserved it out of the goodness of his heart

139
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:46,480
so keep these in mind

140
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:52,320
two events PewDiePie raises and donates $200,000 to Indian kids

141
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:56,800
PewDiePie, to show his gratitude to the YouTube community rallying around him

142
00:09:56,800 --> 00:10:01,200
decides to shout out dozens of small YouTube channels

143
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:03,760
now I don't know about you, but if you ask me

144
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:07,040
these sound like the actions of a pretty good dude

145
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:12,560
so based on these two events, how do you think the online news media reacted to it?

146
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:16,240
well shit they're calling him a fucking racist and a fucking Nazi

147
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:19,520
just like they've been doing for the past year and a half

148
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:26,960
publication after publication reporting that PewDiePie shouts out a racist Nazi channel

149
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:30,560
oh what's this PewDiePie donates $200,000 to kids in India

150
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:33,520
crickets, nothing, you don't hear a peep about it

151
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:37,440
from the fucking blue checkmark so-called online journalists

152
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:41,520
oh but PewDiePie shouts out a channel that sometimes makes edgy jokes

153
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:45,200
oh sound the Nazi alarm we found ourselves another Nazi

154
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:50,960
I can't believe it you guys PewDiePie wants minorities to die in a hellfire

155
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:54,240
and it's not just one or two publications reporting on this

156
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:56,320
it's all the online publications

157
00:10:56,320 --> 00:11:01,600
all going after PewDiePie having him and the word racist in the same headline

158
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:06,240
just a week after PewDiePie raised $200,000 for kids in India

159
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:10,160
and then you got blue checkmark cocksuckers like Joe Bernstein

160
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:14,880
trying to piggyback off the controversy and producing blatantly deceptive posts

161
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:18,880
quote-unquote reporting about the PewDiePie controversy

162
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:21,120
hey man I really appreciate your content

163
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:23,920
you've gotten me through some tough times and I respect the

164
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:33,440
and then when it gets called out on his obvious deceptive reporting

165
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:36,560
he just calls all of his opponents triggered

166
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:37,760
well isn't that nice Joe

167
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:40,240
I want to be totally straightforward with you

168
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:45,040
you will you will never in a million years

169
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:50,640
get a job at a publication as prestigious as the New York Times

170
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:55,440
that will that little pipe dream is never gonna happen

171
00:11:56,080 --> 00:12:02,080
you will be blogging and tweeting until you are dead and nobody will care

172
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:06,880
nobody will ever read anything you wrote and say to themselves

173
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:12,720
this is important I need to know more about this

174
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:15,920
nobody's ever going to read a page that you wrote

175
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:18,400
and say to themselves damn I'm glad I read that

176
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:20,800
they're just gonna it's just fucking popcorn

177
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:23,920
you write the mental equivalent of popcorn

178
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:24,960
white male

179
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:27,520
I agree with that

180
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:31,280
and this is the thing I want to talk about most in this video

181
00:12:31,280 --> 00:12:34,560
what happened to Mumpke and what happened to PewDiePie this week

182
00:12:34,640 --> 00:12:37,360
are both aspects of the same thing

183
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:44,960
both PewDiePie and Mumpke were subject to coordinated attacks by cultural opponents

184
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:47,200
as each day goes on on the internet

185
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:52,480
it's becoming painfully obvious that the internet has now separated into two groups

186
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:54,080
there's people that get it

187
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:57,120
there's people that understand internet culture

188
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:58,640
and then there's everybody else

189
00:12:58,640 --> 00:13:03,360
there's the deadbeat generation of millennials who know how to use the internet

190
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:05,920
but don't actually get the internet

191
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:11,280
you have this group of people who thinks that the internet is nothing more than Netflix and cat pictures

192
00:13:11,280 --> 00:13:15,680
and hey guess what these people are running all the online news publications

193
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:17,520
and they're running youtube

194
00:13:17,520 --> 00:13:22,480
you want to know why youtube rewind this year was an unmitigated disaster

195
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:26,560
and resembled a pile of steaming horse droppings

196
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:32,160
well it would seem that the people in charge of it don't actually understand the culture of youtube

197
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:37,120
and they're just a little bit out of touch with what youtubers actually want

198
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:40,080
and that brings me to the ultimate point of this video

199
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:46,960
youtube and the news media have teamed up to attack and deplatform their cultural opponents

200
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:53,440
in an attempt to engineer and transform the culture of youtube into something they deem fit

201
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:59,040
i saw this coming back in july when youtube teamed up with the legacy news media

202
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:01,840
it shouldn't be much of a coincidence that after that point

203
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:06,000
whenever something bad happens on youtube it's never youtube's fault

204
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:09,920
it's always the evil racist youtuber who's the problem

205
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:13,360
and needs to be deplatformed and have their channel terminated

206
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:17,680
and get called anti-semitic by every publication under the sun

207
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:22,240
and by every time you retweet one of these things or every time you promote this idea

208
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:29,760
you are promoting ignorance racism genocide anti-semitism

209
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:35,440
these are all things that you are putting forward when you are doing anything that promotes pewdiepie

210
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:41,200
so be careful about this if someone decided that if something were to happen if pewdiepie were to

211
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:46,960
be sued for this you could be complicit if you retweet it they could make you pay a fine as well

212
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:53,840
because you have officially published anti-semitic things so if you are republishing this stuff you

213
00:14:53,840 --> 00:14:59,280
could get in trouble for it this is a message to everyone listening to this right now we are at

214
00:14:59,280 --> 00:15:06,000
war the people in charge of these publications and this website have retracted themselves into

215
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:12,560
an ideological bubble and they are attempting to expunge this website of any influential person

216
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:17,920
who doesn't fit into their utopian vision of the site call me a conspiracy theorist if you will

217
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:24,880
but when you witness two attacks one right after the other so coordinated and so absolutely wrong

218
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:30,800
and unfair in their approach something is going on the youtubers have rebelled against this year's

219
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:37,200
youtube rewind literally as i was recording this it has become the most disliked video of all time

220
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:43,360
the youtube community has completely rejected youtube sanitized and pc version of the youtube

221
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:50,080
rewind and frankly we're not going to stand for it anymore we as a youtube community need to unite

222
00:15:50,080 --> 00:15:55,120
against this threat i don't want to hear it if you don't like mumke i don't want to hear it

223
00:15:55,120 --> 00:16:00,880
if you don't like pewdiepie if you in any way support the termination of mumke or the smear

224
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:05,840
campaign against pewdiepie i got news for you buddy you're next they're going to be coming for

225
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:11,440
all of us next and we need to stick by each other and have each other's backs to make sure that

226
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:17,040
whoever youtube and the news media decide to target next as a part of their agenda isn't going

227
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:22,400
to be forced to disappear it's time to put aside our differences it's time to forgive the logan

228
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:29,200
pauls forgive the rice gums and defend ourselves from this much greater problem it could be you

229
00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:38,080
it could be me that specific video violated our policies on harmful slash dangerous content

230
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:43,040
so this was supposed to be the part of the video where i tell you guys to subscribe to

231
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:49,280
mumke's new channel but unfortunately youtube saved me the trouble by banning all of mumke's

232
00:16:49,280 --> 00:16:55,760
remaining accounts at this stage mumke appears to be completely banned from youtube the fact

233
00:16:55,760 --> 00:17:02,320
that youtube has doubled down so hard on banning a channel that is so clearly innocent from what

234
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:09,200
they're accusing him is absolutely outrageous and i cannot reiterate enough how horrific of a

235
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:13,840
precedent this sets for youtube youtube is basically saying that they can go behind the

236
00:17:13,840 --> 00:17:19,280
scenes and delete any channel they want with impunity and completely circumvent any system

237
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:25,520
of due process since mumke's deletion other decently sized youtube channels have also

238
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:31,920
been deleted for seemingly no reason in all eight years of making videos on this platform i have

239
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:37,920
never seen a situation as potentially dangerous as this one where at least in the past it seems

240
00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:43,040
like you had to make a ton of people mad to false flag your videos and take down your channel now

241
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:49,920
all it takes is one single person at youtube who doesn't like you to completely destroy your youtube

242
00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:55,200
career now in the time since mumke's ban a few people like tim pool have come out to report on

243
00:17:55,200 --> 00:18:00,560
the story but other than that there's been a shocking lack of concern over what's happened

244
00:18:00,560 --> 00:18:06,320
here i really don't think youtubers are treating this as seriously as they can and like i said

245
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:12,160
earlier it shouldn't even matter if you don't like mumke or if you thought his termination was

246
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:18,560
justified the fact that we are simply giving youtube the power to terminate any channel they

247
00:18:18,560 --> 00:18:25,200
want with no due process is terrifying and everyone out there who even cares a smidge

248
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:31,600
about this website should be completely up in arms about mumke's takedown this isn't an issue

249
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:38,640
just affecting mumke this is an issue affecting every single person on youtube it doesn't matter

250
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:44,320
if you think you're following the rules mumke thought he was following the rules many of his

251
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:51,200
videos that got taken down were so called manually approved as ad friendly your channel termination

252
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:58,080
could come from out of nowhere with no warning for no reason and there will be nothing you can do

253
00:18:58,080 --> 00:19:03,600
about it it's clear that youtube isn't doing this because they actually want to enforce guidelines

254
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:09,200
last time i checked the plane crash compilation is still online even after youtube claimed to

255
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:16,400
remove 58 million infringing videos this is about the unfair targeting of individual people this is

256
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:22,720
a threat to potentially every creator on the platform and it must not be ignored in a just

257
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:28,240
world mumke would have all of his channels restored but based on some of the slimy stuff

258
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:33,520
this website has perpetrated in the past year i'm not sure that's gonna happen so in the meantime

259
00:19:33,680 --> 00:19:39,360
make sure you follow mumke on twitch because youtube is too authoritarian to let him stay here

260
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:43,840
i really hope they don't ban me for even advertising anything on twitch because they've

261
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:49,200
done it before also if you want to have a look at the last place on youtube where mumke isn't banned

262
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:55,200
you can check out the state of the youtube podcast also featuring me and rusty cage the only reason

263
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:59,680
this channel hasn't also been banned is because mumke doesn't own it but hey i wouldn't put it

264
00:19:59,680 --> 00:20:06,320
past youtube to unfairly take this down too fuck this website and now please enjoy some patron

265
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:11,920
sponsored content hey guys this is babalu productions i'm a small youtuber that makes

266
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:16,320

267
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:21,920
be greatly appreciated or you can go to pornhub instead i mean if you do i don't blame you

268
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:27,040
midget porn is a lot more appealing than my videos will ever be because they look like they were made

269
00:20:27,040 --> 00:20:32,480
in powerpoint but why not both the link to my newest video called if ea made a dildo featuring
