00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:19,680
Let's talk about dank memes.

2
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:26,800
Hi everyone, Anthony Lamptano here with another thrilling edition of Not The Meme Review.

3
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:31,120
If you haven't been paying attention or just living under THE ROCK for the past year, there's

4
00:00:31,120 --> 00:00:35,760
kind of been a trend going on on the internet. A meme revolution, if you will. And this ain't

5
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:42,000
no normal meme revolution. This is a dank meme revolution. It turns out that the year in our

6
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:49,920
Lord 2016 has surprisingly become the greatest year for memes in my entire lifetime. And probably

7
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:54,640
in the entire lifetime of the internet itself. Some people have continued to ignore it saying

8
00:00:54,640 --> 00:01:02,400
shit like, nope, sorry. I don't think it's funny. But be warned, this ain't no peaceful revolution.

9
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:08,320
This is a hostile take ogre. The dank meme train is pulling into the motherfucking station.

10
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:12,960
Ladies and gentlemen, I'm gonna have to ask you to buckle your fuckles because it's all about...

11
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:16,880
These are the top 10 dank memes of 2016.

12
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:35,680
Number 10. Dicks out for Harambe.

13
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:39,920
What did you find, nigga? I'm pressing it! I'm pressing it!

14
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:45,840
Now listen here, son. I know this meme stopped being dank after about week two and a half. I know

15
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:50,800
that the normies took this one over and killed Harambe for the second time. But come on, the sheer

16
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:57,120
magnitude of this meme cannot be ignored. If you ask random people to name one meme from 2016, I

17
00:01:57,120 --> 00:02:03,200
guarantee you that the majority of them will say Harambe. And no matter how normified this meme

18
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:08,720
became down the line, you cannot deny its dank roots. I mean really, dicks out for Harambe?

19
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:11,280
What the fuck does that even mean? What does that mean?

20
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:18,560
It's dumb, it's offensive, it's absolutely disgusting. It's undoubtedly a dank meme.

21
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:24,080
Now whether you consider it the most normied dank meme or the most dank normie meme, one thing's

22
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:30,160
for sure, and that's that the legacy of Harambe will live on forever. It is a testament to the

23
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:36,240
power of memes which took an otherwise forgettable gorilla death and turned it into an unforgettable

24
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:43,200
worldwide phenomenon. And for that, Harambe gets the 10th spot on this list. Also, I made a Harambe

25
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:53,440
joke before it was cool. Let's turn back the clock to early 2015. All the major news outlets

26
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:59,280
are beginning murmurings of the early frontrunners for the 2016 presidential election. People like

27
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:08,400
Hillary Clinton, Chris Christie, Jeb Bush, and America's thinking, oh boy, another boring

28
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:17,360
election. Can't wait. When suddenly from out of nowhere, I am officially running for face god.

29
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:21,440
Now this happens in the summer of 2015 and at this point everyone just points and laughs at him.

30
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:27,040
Hahaha, another joke candidate like Mr. Potato Head or Deez Nuts. That's really funny. And at

31
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:32,800
this stage, that's all it really was to people, a joke. So you got this billionaire reality tv star

32
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:38,240
coming out and saying all this ridiculous bombastic stuff like, I will build a great,

33
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:44,880
great wall on our southern border and I will have Mexico pay for that wall. As if he were a

34
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:50,000
caricature of a Republican politician, just purposely saying whatever he can to piss off

35
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:54,800
as many people as possible. I mean his entire campaign strategy was just to troll the shit

36
00:03:54,800 --> 00:04:00,240
out of his political opponents and the media and act like as much of an ass as possible. So yeah,

37
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:06,000
it was fucking hilarious because nobody thought he would actually succeed. Now flash forward

38
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:11,680
six months to the beginning of 2016. It turns out this guy is holding his own. He's actually

39
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:17,440
doing quite well in the polls, but he's running out of steam. Build a wall and overt xenophobia

40
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:22,480
can only piss people off for so long. Trump needed a new gimmick, a new angle so that he

41
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:28,720
could continue to stay on the cutting edge of relevancy. So he became a dank meme. My father

42
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:33,520
gave me a small loan of a million dollars. You see past presidential candidates have co-existed

43
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:38,640
with and even been subject to memes themselves, but never before has a candidate truly embraced

44
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:43,680
meme culture on the internet. A small loan of a million dollars was the first of a long line of

45
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:50,160
executive quality Trump brand memes. Think of all the great memes Trump gave us in the past year.

46
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:56,800
We got 7-eleven bing bing bong bong wrong grabbed by the person and my personal favorite autism has

47
00:04:56,800 --> 00:05:02,160
become an epidemic. But it all started from a small soundbite about a small loan and for that

48
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:10,640
it gets a spot on this list. So if Trump was the meme lord candidate, Hillary was the fucking

49
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:16,000
meme antichrist. Say what you want about Trump, but he had the foresight to treat meme culture

50
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:21,280
with respect and because of that memes respected him. Hillary on the other hand decided to abuse

51
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:25,920
memes in a desperate attempt to appeal to a generation from which she is half a century

52
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:29,840
removed. Does anyone remember this gem? Pokemon go to the polls.

53
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:37,200
This right here is what caused Pokemon Go to lose all of its players.

54
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:46,800
A career politician who has never played a video game in her entire life trying to appear hip and

55
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:52,720
cool to the young people. I love the young people. Hillary fucking killed Pokemon Go.

56
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:57,200
And that's what happens whenever this woman touches a meme. She kills it

57
00:05:57,200 --> 00:06:00,960
dead. But then she decided to fuck with the wrong meme.

58
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:10,640
You have got to be kidding me. Because in September of this year Hillary decided to

59
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:17,200
go after Pepe, the immortal most quintessential dank meme on the entire internet. Naturally Pepe

60
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:22,320
had partnered with the meme friendly candidate in Donald Trump. However, at a time when the rival

61
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:27,840
candidates were reaching unprecedented levels of animosity, Pepe ended up in Hillary's crosshairs.

62
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:33,360
In a completely unnecessary casualty to the endless mudslinging of this election, Pepe the

63
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:40,000
Frog, one of the most beloved and cherished dank memes of a generation, was officially labeled as

64
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:47,120
a hate symbol per the orders of the Clinton campaign. A hate symbol. So let's review shall

65
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:56,000
we. The swastika. Pepe the Frog. Cross burning. Pepe the Frog. Yeah I see no problems here. Those

66
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:00,720
those things are completely alike. And of course the endless liberal news stations picked up the

67
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:05,920
story and at this point they're strapping into full anti-Trump mode. So of course they would

68
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:11,280
support anything Hillary said or did no matter how asinine or poorly researched it actually was.

69
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:16,400
So in the eyes of the uninformed public Pepe is a hate symbol. And you know what maybe Pepe is a

70
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:23,040
hate symbol because it symbolizes how much us ascended meme lords hate fucking normal things

71
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:29,680
for ruining our dank memes. But alas Pepe's sacrifice was not in vain for it awoke a spirit

72
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:34,240
more powerful than Hillary Clinton or the normies could possibly imagine.

73
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:47,680
Okay so this meme is pretty low-key. You probably weren't expecting it here,

74
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:52,720
but that's part of the reason why it's so good. It's discreet. And if it's used correctly you

75
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:56,800
don't see it coming. That's really the main reason why this meme has been able to stay relatively

76
00:07:56,800 --> 00:08:01,920
fresh over the months. Unless you watch it in a dedicated compilation which repeats the same

77
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:08,480
punchline over and over again completely defeating the humor in the meme. Anyway another

78
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:13,200
reason this meme is significant is because it's the first time that dank memes and progressive

79
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:17,600
rock have ever truly converged on such a large scale. And I know this meme technically originated

80
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:25,680
from an anime. And yes that does knock it down a few pegs in my book. But how can you deny the

81
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:32,560
importance of combining memes, one of the greatest products of the internet, with progressive rock,

82
00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:37,520
one of the greatest genres of music? I feel like dank memes and progressive rock are kindred

83
00:08:37,520 --> 00:08:44,080
spirits in a way. Both are buried under layers, layers, of less sophisticated normie friendly

84
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:49,680
surface media and they require quite a lot of digging to discover. However once you discover

85
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:55,040
them you will find a source of entertainment so dense and so rich that you'd be hard-pressed to

86
00:08:55,040 --> 00:09:07,680
go back to normal media. Now unlike Harambe this meme stayed relatively dank during its time in

87
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:12,880
the spotlight. The concept of this meme is just so dumb I love it. It's simply just making iterated

88
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:18,560
edits to the intro of a poorly animated show that ran for only 16 episodes on some obscure TV

89
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:24,320
channel in the Philippines. Fuck the Philippines! You can't get much more obscure and dank than

90
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:29,280
that. So anyway this meme is pretty straightforward. What you do is you take the Nutshack theme but

91
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:34,240
replace each Nutshack with Smash Mouth's All-Star and you replace each All-Star with a Cyberchase

92
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:39,840
theme. Then replace every other syllable with the entirety of 2001 A Space Odyssey. And every time

93
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:45,680
the monolith appears, Bonzi Buddy reads the entire B movie script. But every time he says B it's

94
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:50,320
replaced with the entire Paul Blart movie. And every time someone says Paul Blart it's replaced

95
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:55,680
with John Cena's intro. Now as you can see we started off with a simple 60 second long intro

96
00:09:55,680 --> 00:10:00,480
but after just a few operations we now have something longer than the entire age of the

97
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:06,720
observable universe. There are just so many layers. But anyway the Nutshack brought with it not just

98
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:12,560
a new meme but a new mode of remix culture. It introduced a new style of video remixing which

99
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:17,440
I like to call butt edits because most of the videos in this style have a subordinate clause

100
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:22,000
in their titles which begin with a conjunction butt. I guess a more technical term would be

101
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:28,800
iterative video remixes but come on butt edit has the word butt in it haha butts like the place

102
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:36,080
where you go poo haha hardy har har yeah I guess I'll just be killing myself then do it but I

103
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:41,760
digress. Thanks to the Nutshack meme we were able to witness the birth of an entirely new genre of

104
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:47,760
shitposting. What a monumental time to be alive. The Nutshack may not have been that big a meme by

105
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:53,760
itself but its impact on the entire face of the shitposting earth cannot be understated. The

106
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:58,880
Nutshack set into motion a transformative video movement that reached heights far greater than

107
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:04,320
the meme itself and for that it deserves its place in history and the number six spot on this list.

108
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:10,400
Well it looks like we're halfway done with the list which means it's time for the ad break remix.

109
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:18,880
falling out of wwe and hiding out in holes waiting for aaron to come people going home

110
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:26,560

124
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:19,760
commentary channels where they act innocent when they're really guilty of almost everything

125
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:26,720
they judge people on it because today is the day we get to bully keemstar i don't understand why

i'm still getting hate john tron is a fucking scumbag

127
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:43,520
2016 ladies and gentlemen was an unprecedented year in youtube drama and it brought with it a

128
00:13:43,520 --> 00:13:49,200
lot of excellent fresh crispy decadent dank memes now don't get me wrong there's always been drama

129
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:56,000
on youtube youtubers calling out other youtubers fanboys attacking fanboys this stuff has been

130
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:02,000
going on since 2007 however there has never been youtube drama on the magnitude which we have seen

131
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:07,120
in 2016 where top level youtubers are at the center of it all this was the first year in which

132
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:13,200
youtube drama has become a main event spectacle rather than just a peripheral byproduct if you

133
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:17,520
go back to the days of guys like the archfiend calling out youtubers those videos did not get

134
00:14:17,520 --> 00:14:24,480
that many views but flash forward to 2016 and youtuber call out and exposed videos frequently

135
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:30,000
get hundreds of thousands and in some cases millions of views youtube drama in any form

136
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:36,960
became a hot commodity this year now why is that well i think it's indicative of a profound change

137
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:42,080
in how we as a society view youtubers if you go back to the days when people like ray william

138
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:47,200
johnson smosh and shane dawson were at the top of the site there always seemed to be something

139
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:52,400
a bit corporate and sterile about them that sort of disengaged them from the general viewer

140
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:57,760
it was just something so impersonal about them we sort of viewed their content like we view

141
00:14:57,760 --> 00:15:04,480
television it was really detached from individual viewers what has changed since then is that modern

142
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:09,760
youtubers and especially commentary channels develop their audiences based on a personal

143
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:14,080
and ideological connection to their viewers therefore when one of these youtubers gets

144
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:18,560
attacked it pisses off a lot more people than it used to let's be honest when all

145
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:22,160
said and done nobody really cared about what happened to ray william johnson people didn't

146
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:27,360
sub to equals three to see ray they subbed him to see funny internet video compilations

147
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:32,720
but if you look at popular channels today many of these popular channels like h3 items leafy

148
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:38,320
keemstar and grade a have a large sect of fans that are head over heels in love with not just

149
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:43,360
their content but the content creators themselves if all this youtube drama is indicative of

150
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:48,560
anything it is that the public is beginning to perceive youtubers as more than just internet

151
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:54,640
personalities youtubers are beginning to resemble a new generation of celebrity and this is the

152
00:15:54,640 --> 00:16:01,200
first year i can say where youtubers have truly felt big in internet culture and we have youtube

153
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:13,440
drama to thank for that so 2016 was largely a year of unexpected breakthroughs the inaro

154
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:17,920
dicaprio finally won an oscar the city of cleveland won their first sports championship

155
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:23,520
in 60 years the chicago cubs won their first world series since teddy russevelt was president

156
00:16:23,520 --> 00:16:26,240
and vaporwave became a popular genre of music

157
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:36,720
so what we have here is this extremely obscure genre of media which remixes pre-existing content

158
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:41,280
in order to completely modify and transform its tone and essentially create a completely

159
00:16:41,280 --> 00:16:47,600
new audio visual experience hmm sounds kind of familiar doesn't it anyway through the power of

160
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:53,360
means vaporwave kind of became a major internet phenomenon this year macintosh plus 420 became

161
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:58,000
this year's youtube national anthem it's pretty surreal to see such an obscure art form become

162
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:03,680
so popular especially considering how vaporwave is thematically critical of mainstream culture

163
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:08,320
i don't know maybe mainstream culture is becoming more critical of mainstream culture i mean just

164
00:17:08,320 --> 00:17:12,800
look at how people reacted to this year's youtube rewind most people were dissatisfied with it

165
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:18,160
calling it the worst rewind ever but i don't think it's a matter of youtube making an inferior

166
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:23,760
product to last year's rewind quality-wise they're about the same the real reason that this year's

167
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:29,760
rewind was perceived so poorly is that youtube itself has changed so much in the past year

168
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:35,520
that the same formulaic inoffensive product from last year has become severely misrepresentative

169
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:42,080
of youtube as a whole in 2016 excluding people like filthy frank in 2015 only really alienated

170
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:48,640
a small fringe minority of youtube audiences who crave more vulgar and mature content but since

171
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:54,480
that time that small fringe group has grown into a pretty significant force on this website and

172
00:17:54,480 --> 00:18:00,960
excluding people like h3 items and leafy this year alienated a much larger group all of these channels

173
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:07,040
practically sprung up from out of nowhere in 2016 and they represented a large group of viewers who

174
00:18:07,040 --> 00:18:11,840
prefer more edgy content than minecraft let's plays you may not like some of these channels

175
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:16,640
but trying to act like these channels did not have a major influence on youtube in 2016 is just flat

176
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:22,800
out ignorant so that's my theory on why the youtube rewind seems so poor this year the rewind hasn't

177
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:28,320
changed but youtube has people are growing tired of the same old stuff and are searching for newer

178
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:33,120
fresher more original content i believe this is the reason why stuff like vaporwave and dank memes

179
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:37,680
have become so popular this year and out of everything i've mentioned in this video this

180
00:18:37,680 --> 00:18:42,800
division that is formed among the youtube viewer base is the only thing i can really say that will

181
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:49,040
continue to grow in relevance heading into 2017 stuff like this doesn't just go away some serious

182
00:18:49,040 --> 00:18:55,120
seas have been planted for a revolution in how we view popular content on this website and it may

183
00:18:55,120 --> 00:19:02,080
have already begun it's real easy just when we look at memes we usually see something silly

184
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:07,520
something for a quick burst of humor to get us through the day but what if i told you that memes

185
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:12,960
could be a force for good so for some reason lazytown memes run on some sort of cycle where

186
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:18,480
they fall in and out of relevancy every few years or so downward cycle previous examples included

187
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:28,240
the likes of being a pirate illegal downloading stop it already anyway 2016 saw the cycle complete

188
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:39,680
yet another rotation with the popularization of what resulted was a continuation of the nutshack

189
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:44,240
inspired butt edits and this meme really took the genre to new heights in both popularity and

190
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:49,200
technical editing skill but underneath all the random and ridiculous remixing was a truly

191
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:54,880
enduring story it turns out that stefan carl the actor who plays robbie rotten in lazytown was

192
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:59,600
recently diagnosed with cancer which required him to undergo surgery the recovery process forced him

193
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:04,560
out of action for a year so some of his associates set up a gofundme page on his behalf to help him

194
00:20:04,560 --> 00:20:09,600
out little did they know that this small request would end up harnessing the power of memes to

195
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:15,600
become one of the most charitable events in 2016 raising over 100 000 for stefan's recovery

196
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:22,560
this was an unprecedented event never before has a dank meme been used to mobilize a charitable

197
00:20:22,560 --> 00:20:27,360
effort of this scale i will admit that this event is similar to the ice bucket challenge from a

198
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:32,560
couple of years ago but i categorize that as more of a social trend and not a meme the ice bucket

199
00:20:32,560 --> 00:20:36,880
challenge also became kind of tarnished because down the stretch people began to do it just

200
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:41,440
because it was trendy while ignoring the charitable cause i feel like the we are number one meme

201
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:46,880
movement has been a lot more genuine in its charitable intent while also showcasing some of

202
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:51,760
the most creative editing talents that youtube has to offer what began is just another meme quickly

203
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:56,640
became one of the biggest feel-good stories of the entire year it demonstrated that some silly

204
00:20:56,640 --> 00:21:01,920
memes on the internet have the power to do some serious good in real life and for that it deserves

205
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:10,800
a spot this high on the list ask yourself this what single meme best defines the 2016 dank meme

206
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:18,480
revolution as a whole no it's not harambe the true mascot of 2016 memory is the one the only

207
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:19,840
the lord the savior

208
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:32,560
here come dat boy it's a gif of a frog riding a unicycle what's not to like but then again

209
00:21:32,560 --> 00:21:39,440
what is to like why did this completely inert illogical idiotic objectively unfunny meme come

210
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:44,800
from basically out of nowhere and blow up into the most popular internet meme in just a couple

211
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:49,760
of days why do we need yet another frog meme isn't it completely unnecessary why does a frog

212
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:56,000
riding a unicycle resonate so well with black people twitter well uh i think when it comes to

213
00:21:56,000 --> 00:22:02,720
dank memes like dat boy and all the ones i've included in this list in order to fully enjoy them

214
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:08,720
rather than asking why you should instead ask yourself why not why not why not why not if the

215
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:16,080
year 2016 has taught us anything it's that we should not just expect the unexpected but

216
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:22,400
unexpected the expected there is no conceivable reason why dat boy should have become a popular

217
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:29,360
meme but that's exactly why it did unbeknownst to all of us dat boy actually foreshadowed all

218
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:35,280
the weird shit that happened later this year it embodies the complete disruption of conventional

219
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:40,880
logic in society that this year brought maybe the reason that that boy became so popular is

220
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:46,560
because society itself is beginning to think differently consider this could dat boy have

221
00:22:46,560 --> 00:22:53,840
become a popular meme 10 5 or even 2 years ago it's hard to tell for sure but if you just look

222
00:22:53,840 --> 00:23:00,000
at the most popular memes from those eras nothing even comes close to the level of dank on which

223
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:06,320
dat boy lies the internet in 2016 is very different from how it was in 2011 information

224
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:11,760
propagates so much faster every thought is more instantaneous than the last memes like dat boy

225
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:16,640
reach insane levels of popularity but can only maintain those levels for a short amount of time

226
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:22,480
before they fall out of relevancy downward spiral downward spiral downward spiral the meteoric rise

227
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:27,440
and fall of dat boy reminds me of the careers of talented artists such as kurt cobain who reached

228
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:34,400
incredible heights and set entirely new paradigms in their medium truly brilliant in the moment but

229
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:42,240
that moment ends so quickly that boy died a horrible painful cringy death of oversaturation

230
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:48,320
by normies but despite its fleeting time in relevancy dat boy could potentially be one of

231
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:54,880
the most important memes of our generation that boy is so significant not because it was the

232
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:59,600
funniest meme not because it was the most relatable meme that boy is significant because

233
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:06,400
it changed the way that we as an internet society view memes it's no longer necessary for popular

234
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:12,800
memes to be completely logical or contain an obvious punchline dat boy showed us that anything

235
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:18,880
can become a popular meme and because of it meme culture will never be the same again now before

236
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:22,880
we get to the number one dank meme of 2016 here are some honorable mentions

237
00:24:31,040 --> 00:24:36,880
i have crippling depression jesus christ that's jason born i'm rick harrison and this is my

238
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:38,880
pawn shop make a nation

239
00:24:43,280 --> 00:24:49,920
i do not associate with mega faggot get the fuck out of my room i'm playing minecraft

240
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:55,360
i'll have two number nines this one player keeps kicking my ass is it the legend 27 enough

241
00:24:58,560 --> 00:25:02,880
we are number one

242
00:25:07,280 --> 00:25:08,880
there has been an awakening

243
00:25:14,800 --> 00:25:15,760
have you felt it

244
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:28,800
the controversy surrounding the idea of the social justice warrior and the regressive left

245
00:25:28,800 --> 00:25:34,000
has been swirling for just over two years now this whole debate essentially comes down to critiquing

246
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:39,920
radical liberal viewpoints that were previously unchecked in internet discussion starting in 2014

247
00:25:39,920 --> 00:25:46,000
the anti-social justice movement was picking up some momentum for sure but by early 2016 it was

248
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:50,400
just another one of the thousands of different political viewpoints on the internet people on the

249
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:55,760
internet generally have a level of stubbornness which cannot be penetrated by conventional logical

250
00:25:55,760 --> 00:26:01,520
arguments new ideas and ways of thinking need a little extra push to expand beyond this level and

251
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:07,600
change people's minds people need to be able to consume the idea in an easily recognizable image

252
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:24,640
or symbol this sounds like a job for memes specifically triggered began to embody the

253
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:30,400
entire anti-social justice movement with just a single label it's such a simple and straightforward

254
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:36,240
meme essentially just another way of calling someone angry so why is it the number one dank

255
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:43,120
meme of 2016 well its simplicity caused the meme to spread and along with it the ideas of anti-social

256
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:48,480
justice all of us thought we were just spreading a funny meme but what we were really doing is

257
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:54,480
swinging the ideological pendulum of the internet ever so farther away from the left there's been a

258
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:59,520
pretty big elephant in the room hovering over this video you all know what it is and this whole video

259
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:03,760
has been leading up to it so far in this list i've written over 3500 words analyzing and

260
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:10,320
speculating fucking memes and i'm getting pretty tired so all i'm gonna say is this recently i saw

261
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:15,360
the movie arrival and one scene stuck out to me in which the main characters discuss a theory where

262
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:22,080
the type of language you speak can affect the way you think so that got me wondering memes are sort

263
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:28,480
of like an internet language they are capable of communicating meaning between people and that made

264
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:34,640
me ask the question what if what if the memes we use have a greater influence on our behavior than

265
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:41,280
we think what if a meme could ever so slightly shift society's political views to the right

266
00:27:41,280 --> 00:27:48,160
what if a dank meme revolution just so happened to unfold during a presidential election year

267
00:27:48,160 --> 00:27:53,600
in which the right-wing candidate is much more meme friendly than the left-wing candidate and

268
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:58,560
what if memes could sway just enough votes to the right-wing candidate so that he could

269
00:27:58,560 --> 00:28:04,320
unexpectedly win critical swing states necessary for him to win the presidential election

270
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:14,560
there's been an awakening all right people have disrespected and abused the power of memes for

271
00:28:14,560 --> 00:28:21,200
too long the dank tension has been building and rising for years and in 2016 it reached the

272
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:27,040
boiling point it just needed a little push to set it over the edge and when hillary rod and clinton

273
00:28:27,040 --> 00:28:33,360
forsake pepe for political gain she awoke an ancient meme force so powerful that it changed

274
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:39,760
the course of human society forever the cult of keck has been unleashed from its dormancy

275
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:45,120
an entire year of joking around about memes has reared its head and now a dank meme has been

276
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:51,120
elected president of the united states and it doesn't matter who you call triggered anymore

277
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:57,680
because all of us have triggered a dank meme ascension the likes of which we couldn't even imagine

278
00:28:57,680 --> 00:29:10,240
but hey that's just a theory a meme theory thanks for unsubscribing

279
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:29,140
you
