00:00.000 --> 00:19.680
Let's talk about dank memes.

00:19.680 --> 00:26.800
Hi everyone, Anthony Lamptano here with another thrilling edition of Not The Meme Review.

00:26.800 --> 00:31.120
If you haven't been paying attention or just living under THE ROCK for the past year, there's

00:31.120 --> 00:35.760
kind of been a trend going on on the internet. A meme revolution, if you will. And this ain't

00:35.760 --> 00:42.000
no normal meme revolution. This is a dank meme revolution. It turns out that the year in our

00:42.000 --> 00:49.920
Lord 2016 has surprisingly become the greatest year for memes in my entire lifetime. And probably

00:49.920 --> 00:54.640
in the entire lifetime of the internet itself. Some people have continued to ignore it saying

00:54.640 --> 01:02.400
shit like, nope, sorry. I don't think it's funny. But be warned, this ain't no peaceful revolution.

01:02.400 --> 01:08.320
This is a hostile take ogre. The dank meme train is pulling into the motherfucking station.

01:08.320 --> 01:12.960
Ladies and gentlemen, I'm gonna have to ask you to buckle your fuckles because it's all about...

01:12.960 --> 01:16.880
These are the top 10 dank memes of 2016.

01:24.640 --> 01:35.680
Number 10. Dicks out for Harambe.

01:35.680 --> 01:39.920
What did you find, nigga? I'm pressing it! I'm pressing it!

01:39.920 --> 01:45.840
Now listen here, son. I know this meme stopped being dank after about week two and a half. I know

01:45.840 --> 01:50.800
that the normies took this one over and killed Harambe for the second time. But come on, the sheer

01:50.800 --> 01:57.120
magnitude of this meme cannot be ignored. If you ask random people to name one meme from 2016, I

01:57.120 --> 02:03.200
guarantee you that the majority of them will say Harambe. And no matter how normified this meme

02:03.200 --> 02:08.720
became down the line, you cannot deny its dank roots. I mean really, dicks out for Harambe?

02:08.720 --> 02:11.280
What the fuck does that even mean? What does that mean?

02:12.880 --> 02:18.560
It's dumb, it's offensive, it's absolutely disgusting. It's undoubtedly a dank meme.

02:18.560 --> 02:24.080
Now whether you consider it the most normied dank meme or the most dank normie meme, one thing's

02:24.080 --> 02:30.160
for sure, and that's that the legacy of Harambe will live on forever. It is a testament to the

02:30.160 --> 02:36.240
power of memes which took an otherwise forgettable gorilla death and turned it into an unforgettable

02:36.240 --> 02:43.200
worldwide phenomenon. And for that, Harambe gets the 10th spot on this list. Also, I made a Harambe

02:43.200 --> 02:53.440
joke before it was cool. Let's turn back the clock to early 2015. All the major news outlets

02:53.440 --> 02:59.280
are beginning murmurings of the early frontrunners for the 2016 presidential election. People like

02:59.280 --> 03:08.400
Hillary Clinton, Chris Christie, Jeb Bush, and America's thinking, oh boy, another boring

03:08.400 --> 03:17.360
election. Can't wait. When suddenly from out of nowhere, I am officially running for face god.

03:17.360 --> 03:21.440
Now this happens in the summer of 2015 and at this point everyone just points and laughs at him.

03:21.440 --> 03:27.040
Hahaha, another joke candidate like Mr. Potato Head or Deez Nuts. That's really funny. And at

03:27.040 --> 03:32.800
this stage, that's all it really was to people, a joke. So you got this billionaire reality tv star

03:32.800 --> 03:38.240
coming out and saying all this ridiculous bombastic stuff like, I will build a great,

03:38.240 --> 03:44.880
great wall on our southern border and I will have Mexico pay for that wall. As if he were a

03:44.880 --> 03:50.000
caricature of a Republican politician, just purposely saying whatever he can to piss off

03:50.000 --> 03:54.800
as many people as possible. I mean his entire campaign strategy was just to troll the shit

03:54.800 --> 04:00.240
out of his political opponents and the media and act like as much of an ass as possible. So yeah,

04:00.240 --> 04:06.000
it was fucking hilarious because nobody thought he would actually succeed. Now flash forward

04:06.000 --> 04:11.680
six months to the beginning of 2016. It turns out this guy is holding his own. He's actually

04:11.680 --> 04:17.440
doing quite well in the polls, but he's running out of steam. Build a wall and overt xenophobia

04:17.440 --> 04:22.480
can only piss people off for so long. Trump needed a new gimmick, a new angle so that he

04:22.480 --> 04:28.720
could continue to stay on the cutting edge of relevancy. So he became a dank meme. My father

04:28.720 --> 04:33.520
gave me a small loan of a million dollars. You see past presidential candidates have co-existed

04:33.520 --> 04:38.640
with and even been subject to memes themselves, but never before has a candidate truly embraced

04:38.640 --> 04:43.680
meme culture on the internet. A small loan of a million dollars was the first of a long line of

04:43.680 --> 04:50.160
executive quality Trump brand memes. Think of all the great memes Trump gave us in the past year.

04:50.160 --> 04:56.800
We got 7-eleven bing bing bong bong wrong grabbed by the person and my personal favorite autism has

04:56.800 --> 05:02.160
become an epidemic. But it all started from a small soundbite about a small loan and for that

05:02.160 --> 05:10.640
it gets a spot on this list. So if Trump was the meme lord candidate, Hillary was the fucking

05:10.640 --> 05:16.000
meme antichrist. Say what you want about Trump, but he had the foresight to treat meme culture

05:16.000 --> 05:21.280
with respect and because of that memes respected him. Hillary on the other hand decided to abuse

05:21.280 --> 05:25.920
memes in a desperate attempt to appeal to a generation from which she is half a century

05:25.920 --> 05:29.840
removed. Does anyone remember this gem? Pokemon go to the polls.

05:34.240 --> 05:37.200
This right here is what caused Pokemon Go to lose all of its players.

05:41.200 --> 05:46.800
A career politician who has never played a video game in her entire life trying to appear hip and

05:46.800 --> 05:52.720
cool to the young people. I love the young people. Hillary fucking killed Pokemon Go.

05:53.600 --> 05:57.200
And that's what happens whenever this woman touches a meme. She kills it

05:57.200 --> 06:00.960
dead. But then she decided to fuck with the wrong meme.

06:06.160 --> 06:10.640
You have got to be kidding me. Because in September of this year Hillary decided to

06:10.640 --> 06:17.200
go after Pepe, the immortal most quintessential dank meme on the entire internet. Naturally Pepe

06:17.200 --> 06:22.320
had partnered with the meme friendly candidate in Donald Trump. However, at a time when the rival

06:22.320 --> 06:27.840
candidates were reaching unprecedented levels of animosity, Pepe ended up in Hillary's crosshairs.

06:27.840 --> 06:33.360
In a completely unnecessary casualty to the endless mudslinging of this election, Pepe the

06:33.360 --> 06:40.000
Frog, one of the most beloved and cherished dank memes of a generation, was officially labeled as

06:40.000 --> 06:47.120
a hate symbol per the orders of the Clinton campaign. A hate symbol. So let's review shall

06:47.120 --> 06:56.000
we. The swastika. Pepe the Frog. Cross burning. Pepe the Frog. Yeah I see no problems here. Those

06:56.000 --> 07:00.720
those things are completely alike. And of course the endless liberal news stations picked up the

07:00.720 --> 07:05.920
story and at this point they're strapping into full anti-Trump mode. So of course they would

07:05.920 --> 07:11.280
support anything Hillary said or did no matter how asinine or poorly researched it actually was.

07:11.280 --> 07:16.400
So in the eyes of the uninformed public Pepe is a hate symbol. And you know what maybe Pepe is a

07:16.400 --> 07:23.040
hate symbol because it symbolizes how much us ascended meme lords hate fucking normal things

07:23.040 --> 07:29.680
for ruining our dank memes. But alas Pepe's sacrifice was not in vain for it awoke a spirit

07:29.680 --> 07:34.240
more powerful than Hillary Clinton or the normies could possibly imagine.

07:34.240 --> 07:47.680
Okay so this meme is pretty low-key. You probably weren't expecting it here,

07:47.680 --> 07:52.720
but that's part of the reason why it's so good. It's discreet. And if it's used correctly you

07:52.720 --> 07:56.800
don't see it coming. That's really the main reason why this meme has been able to stay relatively

07:56.800 --> 08:01.920
fresh over the months. Unless you watch it in a dedicated compilation which repeats the same

08:01.920 --> 08:08.480
punchline over and over again completely defeating the humor in the meme. Anyway another

08:08.480 --> 08:13.200
reason this meme is significant is because it's the first time that dank memes and progressive

08:13.200 --> 08:17.600
rock have ever truly converged on such a large scale. And I know this meme technically originated

08:17.600 --> 08:25.680
from an anime. And yes that does knock it down a few pegs in my book. But how can you deny the

08:25.680 --> 08:32.560
importance of combining memes, one of the greatest products of the internet, with progressive rock,

08:32.560 --> 08:37.520
one of the greatest genres of music? I feel like dank memes and progressive rock are kindred

08:37.520 --> 08:44.080
spirits in a way. Both are buried under layers, layers, of less sophisticated normie friendly

08:44.080 --> 08:49.680
surface media and they require quite a lot of digging to discover. However once you discover

08:49.680 --> 08:55.040
them you will find a source of entertainment so dense and so rich that you'd be hard-pressed to

08:55.040 --> 09:07.680
go back to normal media. Now unlike Harambe this meme stayed relatively dank during its time in

09:07.680 --> 09:12.880
the spotlight. The concept of this meme is just so dumb I love it. It's simply just making iterated

09:12.880 --> 09:18.560
edits to the intro of a poorly animated show that ran for only 16 episodes on some obscure TV

09:18.560 --> 09:24.320
channel in the Philippines. Fuck the Philippines! You can't get much more obscure and dank than

09:24.320 --> 09:29.280
that. So anyway this meme is pretty straightforward. What you do is you take the Nutshack theme but

09:29.280 --> 09:34.240
replace each Nutshack with Smash Mouth's All-Star and you replace each All-Star with a Cyberchase

09:34.240 --> 09:39.840
theme. Then replace every other syllable with the entirety of 2001 A Space Odyssey. And every time

09:39.840 --> 09:45.680
the monolith appears, Bonzi Buddy reads the entire B movie script. But every time he says B it's

09:45.680 --> 09:50.320
replaced with the entire Paul Blart movie. And every time someone says Paul Blart it's replaced

09:50.320 --> 09:55.680
with John Cena's intro. Now as you can see we started off with a simple 60 second long intro

09:55.680 --> 10:00.480
but after just a few operations we now have something longer than the entire age of the

10:00.480 --> 10:06.720
observable universe. There are just so many layers. But anyway the Nutshack brought with it not just

10:06.720 --> 10:12.560
a new meme but a new mode of remix culture. It introduced a new style of video remixing which

10:12.560 --> 10:17.440
I like to call butt edits because most of the videos in this style have a subordinate clause

10:17.440 --> 10:22.000
in their titles which begin with a conjunction butt. I guess a more technical term would be

10:22.000 --> 10:28.800
iterative video remixes but come on butt edit has the word butt in it haha butts like the place

10:28.800 --> 10:36.080
where you go poo haha hardy har har yeah I guess I'll just be killing myself then do it but I

10:36.080 --> 10:41.760
digress. Thanks to the Nutshack meme we were able to witness the birth of an entirely new genre of

10:41.760 --> 10:47.760
shitposting. What a monumental time to be alive. The Nutshack may not have been that big a meme by

10:47.760 --> 10:53.760
itself but its impact on the entire face of the shitposting earth cannot be understated. The

10:53.760 --> 10:58.880
Nutshack set into motion a transformative video movement that reached heights far greater than

10:58.880 --> 11:04.320
the meme itself and for that it deserves its place in history and the number six spot on this list.

11:04.320 --> 11:10.400
Well it looks like we're halfway done with the list which means it's time for the ad break remix.

11:10.400 --> 11:18.880
falling out of wwe and hiding out in holes waiting for aaron to come people going home

11:20.000 --> 11:26.560

12:00.400 --> 12:10.080

what is up trawler nation i'm your host leafy is here popular youtuber has been blowing up

13:06.080 --> 13:11.040
big time hey what's up guys it's leafy and it's been about three days since i fucked up but i

13:11.040 --> 13:16.080
never thought i would say these words right a whole genre of youtubers of these kind of

13:16.080 --> 13:19.760
commentary channels where they act innocent when they're really guilty of almost everything

13:19.760 --> 13:26.720
they judge people on it because today is the day we get to bully keemstar i don't understand why

13:26.720 --> 13:30.880
i'm still getting hate john tron is a fucking scumbag

13:37.680 --> 13:43.520
2016 ladies and gentlemen was an unprecedented year in youtube drama and it brought with it a

13:43.520 --> 13:49.200
lot of excellent fresh crispy decadent dank memes now don't get me wrong there's always been drama

13:49.200 --> 13:56.000
on youtube youtubers calling out other youtubers fanboys attacking fanboys this stuff has been

13:56.000 --> 14:02.000
going on since 2007 however there has never been youtube drama on the magnitude which we have seen

14:02.000 --> 14:07.120
in 2016 where top level youtubers are at the center of it all this was the first year in which

14:07.120 --> 14:13.200
youtube drama has become a main event spectacle rather than just a peripheral byproduct if you

14:13.200 --> 14:17.520
go back to the days of guys like the archfiend calling out youtubers those videos did not get

14:17.520 --> 14:24.480
that many views but flash forward to 2016 and youtuber call out and exposed videos frequently

14:24.480 --> 14:30.000
get hundreds of thousands and in some cases millions of views youtube drama in any form

14:30.000 --> 14:36.960
became a hot commodity this year now why is that well i think it's indicative of a profound change

14:36.960 --> 14:42.080
in how we as a society view youtubers if you go back to the days when people like ray william

14:42.080 --> 14:47.200
johnson smosh and shane dawson were at the top of the site there always seemed to be something

14:47.200 --> 14:52.400
a bit corporate and sterile about them that sort of disengaged them from the general viewer

14:52.400 --> 14:57.760
it was just something so impersonal about them we sort of viewed their content like we view

14:57.760 --> 15:04.480
television it was really detached from individual viewers what has changed since then is that modern

15:04.480 --> 15:09.760
youtubers and especially commentary channels develop their audiences based on a personal

15:09.760 --> 15:14.080
and ideological connection to their viewers therefore when one of these youtubers gets

15:14.080 --> 15:18.560
attacked it pisses off a lot more people than it used to let's be honest when all

15:18.560 --> 15:22.160
said and done nobody really cared about what happened to ray william johnson people didn't

15:22.160 --> 15:27.360
sub to equals three to see ray they subbed him to see funny internet video compilations

15:27.360 --> 15:32.720
but if you look at popular channels today many of these popular channels like h3 items leafy

15:32.720 --> 15:38.320
keemstar and grade a have a large sect of fans that are head over heels in love with not just

15:38.320 --> 15:43.360
their content but the content creators themselves if all this youtube drama is indicative of

15:43.360 --> 15:48.560
anything it is that the public is beginning to perceive youtubers as more than just internet

15:48.560 --> 15:54.640
personalities youtubers are beginning to resemble a new generation of celebrity and this is the

15:54.640 --> 16:01.200
first year i can say where youtubers have truly felt big in internet culture and we have youtube

16:01.200 --> 16:13.440
drama to thank for that so 2016 was largely a year of unexpected breakthroughs the inaro

16:13.440 --> 16:17.920
dicaprio finally won an oscar the city of cleveland won their first sports championship

16:17.920 --> 16:23.520
in 60 years the chicago cubs won their first world series since teddy russevelt was president

16:23.520 --> 16:26.240
and vaporwave became a popular genre of music

16:31.120 --> 16:36.720
so what we have here is this extremely obscure genre of media which remixes pre-existing content

16:36.720 --> 16:41.280
in order to completely modify and transform its tone and essentially create a completely

16:41.280 --> 16:47.600
new audio visual experience hmm sounds kind of familiar doesn't it anyway through the power of

16:47.600 --> 16:53.360
means vaporwave kind of became a major internet phenomenon this year macintosh plus 420 became

16:53.360 --> 16:58.000
this year's youtube national anthem it's pretty surreal to see such an obscure art form become

16:58.000 --> 17:03.680
so popular especially considering how vaporwave is thematically critical of mainstream culture

17:03.680 --> 17:08.320
i don't know maybe mainstream culture is becoming more critical of mainstream culture i mean just

17:08.320 --> 17:12.800
look at how people reacted to this year's youtube rewind most people were dissatisfied with it

17:12.800 --> 17:18.160
calling it the worst rewind ever but i don't think it's a matter of youtube making an inferior

17:18.160 --> 17:23.760
product to last year's rewind quality-wise they're about the same the real reason that this year's

17:23.760 --> 17:29.760
rewind was perceived so poorly is that youtube itself has changed so much in the past year

17:29.760 --> 17:35.520
that the same formulaic inoffensive product from last year has become severely misrepresentative

17:35.520 --> 17:42.080
of youtube as a whole in 2016 excluding people like filthy frank in 2015 only really alienated

17:42.080 --> 17:48.640
a small fringe minority of youtube audiences who crave more vulgar and mature content but since

17:48.640 --> 17:54.480
that time that small fringe group has grown into a pretty significant force on this website and

17:54.480 --> 18:00.960
excluding people like h3 items and leafy this year alienated a much larger group all of these channels

18:00.960 --> 18:07.040
practically sprung up from out of nowhere in 2016 and they represented a large group of viewers who

18:07.040 --> 18:11.840
prefer more edgy content than minecraft let's plays you may not like some of these channels

18:11.840 --> 18:16.640
but trying to act like these channels did not have a major influence on youtube in 2016 is just flat

18:16.640 --> 18:22.800
out ignorant so that's my theory on why the youtube rewind seems so poor this year the rewind hasn't

18:22.800 --> 18:28.320
changed but youtube has people are growing tired of the same old stuff and are searching for newer

18:28.320 --> 18:33.120
fresher more original content i believe this is the reason why stuff like vaporwave and dank memes

18:33.120 --> 18:37.680
have become so popular this year and out of everything i've mentioned in this video this

18:37.680 --> 18:42.800
division that is formed among the youtube viewer base is the only thing i can really say that will

18:42.800 --> 18:49.040
continue to grow in relevance heading into 2017 stuff like this doesn't just go away some serious

18:49.040 --> 18:55.120
seas have been planted for a revolution in how we view popular content on this website and it may

18:55.120 --> 19:02.080
have already begun it's real easy just when we look at memes we usually see something silly

19:02.080 --> 19:07.520
something for a quick burst of humor to get us through the day but what if i told you that memes

19:07.520 --> 19:12.960
could be a force for good so for some reason lazytown memes run on some sort of cycle where

19:12.960 --> 19:18.480
they fall in and out of relevancy every few years or so downward cycle previous examples included

19:18.480 --> 19:28.240
the likes of being a pirate illegal downloading stop it already anyway 2016 saw the cycle complete

19:28.240 --> 19:39.680
yet another rotation with the popularization of what resulted was a continuation of the nutshack

19:39.680 --> 19:44.240
inspired butt edits and this meme really took the genre to new heights in both popularity and

19:44.240 --> 19:49.200
technical editing skill but underneath all the random and ridiculous remixing was a truly

19:49.200 --> 19:54.880
enduring story it turns out that stefan carl the actor who plays robbie rotten in lazytown was

19:54.880 --> 19:59.600
recently diagnosed with cancer which required him to undergo surgery the recovery process forced him

19:59.600 --> 20:04.560
out of action for a year so some of his associates set up a gofundme page on his behalf to help him

20:04.560 --> 20:09.600
out little did they know that this small request would end up harnessing the power of memes to

20:09.600 --> 20:15.600
become one of the most charitable events in 2016 raising over 100 000 for stefan's recovery

20:15.600 --> 20:22.560
this was an unprecedented event never before has a dank meme been used to mobilize a charitable

20:22.560 --> 20:27.360
effort of this scale i will admit that this event is similar to the ice bucket challenge from a

20:27.360 --> 20:32.560
couple of years ago but i categorize that as more of a social trend and not a meme the ice bucket

20:32.560 --> 20:36.880
challenge also became kind of tarnished because down the stretch people began to do it just

20:36.880 --> 20:41.440
because it was trendy while ignoring the charitable cause i feel like the we are number one meme

20:41.440 --> 20:46.880
movement has been a lot more genuine in its charitable intent while also showcasing some of

20:46.880 --> 20:51.760
the most creative editing talents that youtube has to offer what began is just another meme quickly

20:51.760 --> 20:56.640
became one of the biggest feel-good stories of the entire year it demonstrated that some silly

20:56.640 --> 21:01.920
memes on the internet have the power to do some serious good in real life and for that it deserves

21:01.920 --> 21:10.800
a spot this high on the list ask yourself this what single meme best defines the 2016 dank meme

21:10.800 --> 21:18.480
revolution as a whole no it's not harambe the true mascot of 2016 memory is the one the only

21:18.480 --> 21:19.840
the lord the savior

21:25.280 --> 21:32.560
here come dat boy it's a gif of a frog riding a unicycle what's not to like but then again

21:32.560 --> 21:39.440
what is to like why did this completely inert illogical idiotic objectively unfunny meme come

21:39.440 --> 21:44.800
from basically out of nowhere and blow up into the most popular internet meme in just a couple

21:44.800 --> 21:49.760
of days why do we need yet another frog meme isn't it completely unnecessary why does a frog

21:49.760 --> 21:56.000
riding a unicycle resonate so well with black people twitter well uh i think when it comes to

21:56.000 --> 22:02.720
dank memes like dat boy and all the ones i've included in this list in order to fully enjoy them

22:02.720 --> 22:08.720
rather than asking why you should instead ask yourself why not why not why not why not if the

22:08.720 --> 22:16.080
year 2016 has taught us anything it's that we should not just expect the unexpected but

22:16.080 --> 22:22.400
unexpected the expected there is no conceivable reason why dat boy should have become a popular

22:22.400 --> 22:29.360
meme but that's exactly why it did unbeknownst to all of us dat boy actually foreshadowed all

22:29.360 --> 22:35.280
the weird shit that happened later this year it embodies the complete disruption of conventional

22:35.280 --> 22:40.880
logic in society that this year brought maybe the reason that that boy became so popular is

22:40.880 --> 22:46.560
because society itself is beginning to think differently consider this could dat boy have

22:46.560 --> 22:53.840
become a popular meme 10 5 or even 2 years ago it's hard to tell for sure but if you just look

22:53.840 --> 23:00.000
at the most popular memes from those eras nothing even comes close to the level of dank on which

23:00.000 --> 23:06.320
dat boy lies the internet in 2016 is very different from how it was in 2011 information

23:06.320 --> 23:11.760
propagates so much faster every thought is more instantaneous than the last memes like dat boy

23:11.760 --> 23:16.640
reach insane levels of popularity but can only maintain those levels for a short amount of time

23:16.640 --> 23:22.480
before they fall out of relevancy downward spiral downward spiral downward spiral the meteoric rise

23:22.480 --> 23:27.440
and fall of dat boy reminds me of the careers of talented artists such as kurt cobain who reached

23:27.440 --> 23:34.400
incredible heights and set entirely new paradigms in their medium truly brilliant in the moment but

23:34.400 --> 23:42.240
that moment ends so quickly that boy died a horrible painful cringy death of oversaturation

23:42.240 --> 23:48.320
by normies but despite its fleeting time in relevancy dat boy could potentially be one of

23:48.320 --> 23:54.880
the most important memes of our generation that boy is so significant not because it was the

23:54.880 --> 23:59.600
funniest meme not because it was the most relatable meme that boy is significant because

23:59.600 --> 24:06.400
it changed the way that we as an internet society view memes it's no longer necessary for popular

24:06.400 --> 24:12.800
memes to be completely logical or contain an obvious punchline dat boy showed us that anything

24:12.800 --> 24:18.880
can become a popular meme and because of it meme culture will never be the same again now before

24:18.880 --> 24:22.880
we get to the number one dank meme of 2016 here are some honorable mentions

24:31.040 --> 24:36.880
i have crippling depression jesus christ that's jason born i'm rick harrison and this is my

24:36.880 --> 24:38.880
pawn shop make a nation

24:43.280 --> 24:49.920
i do not associate with mega faggot get the fuck out of my room i'm playing minecraft

24:49.920 --> 24:55.360
i'll have two number nines this one player keeps kicking my ass is it the legend 27 enough

24:58.560 --> 25:02.880
we are number one

25:07.280 --> 25:08.880
there has been an awakening

25:14.800 --> 25:15.760
have you felt it

25:23.840 --> 25:28.800
the controversy surrounding the idea of the social justice warrior and the regressive left

25:28.800 --> 25:34.000
has been swirling for just over two years now this whole debate essentially comes down to critiquing

25:34.000 --> 25:39.920
radical liberal viewpoints that were previously unchecked in internet discussion starting in 2014

25:39.920 --> 25:46.000
the anti-social justice movement was picking up some momentum for sure but by early 2016 it was

25:46.000 --> 25:50.400
just another one of the thousands of different political viewpoints on the internet people on the

25:50.400 --> 25:55.760
internet generally have a level of stubbornness which cannot be penetrated by conventional logical

25:55.760 --> 26:01.520
arguments new ideas and ways of thinking need a little extra push to expand beyond this level and

26:01.520 --> 26:07.600
change people's minds people need to be able to consume the idea in an easily recognizable image

26:07.600 --> 26:24.640
or symbol this sounds like a job for memes specifically triggered began to embody the

26:24.640 --> 26:30.400
entire anti-social justice movement with just a single label it's such a simple and straightforward

26:30.400 --> 26:36.240
meme essentially just another way of calling someone angry so why is it the number one dank

26:36.240 --> 26:43.120
meme of 2016 well its simplicity caused the meme to spread and along with it the ideas of anti-social

26:43.120 --> 26:48.480
justice all of us thought we were just spreading a funny meme but what we were really doing is

26:48.480 --> 26:54.480
swinging the ideological pendulum of the internet ever so farther away from the left there's been a

26:54.480 --> 26:59.520
pretty big elephant in the room hovering over this video you all know what it is and this whole video

26:59.520 --> 27:03.760
has been leading up to it so far in this list i've written over 3500 words analyzing and

27:03.760 --> 27:10.320
speculating fucking memes and i'm getting pretty tired so all i'm gonna say is this recently i saw

27:10.320 --> 27:15.360
the movie arrival and one scene stuck out to me in which the main characters discuss a theory where

27:15.360 --> 27:22.080
the type of language you speak can affect the way you think so that got me wondering memes are sort

27:22.080 --> 27:28.480
of like an internet language they are capable of communicating meaning between people and that made

27:28.480 --> 27:34.640
me ask the question what if what if the memes we use have a greater influence on our behavior than

27:34.640 --> 27:41.280
we think what if a meme could ever so slightly shift society's political views to the right

27:41.280 --> 27:48.160
what if a dank meme revolution just so happened to unfold during a presidential election year

27:48.160 --> 27:53.600
in which the right-wing candidate is much more meme friendly than the left-wing candidate and

27:53.600 --> 27:58.560
what if memes could sway just enough votes to the right-wing candidate so that he could

27:58.560 --> 28:04.320
unexpectedly win critical swing states necessary for him to win the presidential election

28:09.440 --> 28:14.560
there's been an awakening all right people have disrespected and abused the power of memes for

28:14.560 --> 28:21.200
too long the dank tension has been building and rising for years and in 2016 it reached the

28:21.200 --> 28:27.040
boiling point it just needed a little push to set it over the edge and when hillary rod and clinton

28:27.040 --> 28:33.360
forsake pepe for political gain she awoke an ancient meme force so powerful that it changed

28:33.360 --> 28:39.760
the course of human society forever the cult of keck has been unleashed from its dormancy

28:39.760 --> 28:45.120
an entire year of joking around about memes has reared its head and now a dank meme has been

28:45.120 --> 28:51.120
elected president of the united states and it doesn't matter who you call triggered anymore

28:51.120 --> 28:57.680
because all of us have triggered a dank meme ascension the likes of which we couldn't even imagine

28:57.680 --> 29:10.240
but hey that's just a theory a meme theory thanks for unsubscribing

29:27.680 --> 29:29.140
you
