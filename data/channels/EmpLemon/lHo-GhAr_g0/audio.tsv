0	19680	Let's talk about dank memes.
19680	26800	Hi everyone, Anthony Lamptano here with another thrilling edition of Not The Meme Review.
26800	31120	If you haven't been paying attention or just living under THE ROCK for the past year, there's
31120	35760	kind of been a trend going on on the internet. A meme revolution, if you will. And this ain't
35760	42000	no normal meme revolution. This is a dank meme revolution. It turns out that the year in our
42000	49920	Lord 2016 has surprisingly become the greatest year for memes in my entire lifetime. And probably
49920	54640	in the entire lifetime of the internet itself. Some people have continued to ignore it saying
54640	62400	shit like, nope, sorry. I don't think it's funny. But be warned, this ain't no peaceful revolution.
62400	68320	This is a hostile take ogre. The dank meme train is pulling into the motherfucking station.
68320	72960	Ladies and gentlemen, I'm gonna have to ask you to buckle your fuckles because it's all about...
72960	76880	These are the top 10 dank memes of 2016.
84640	95680	Number 10. Dicks out for Harambe.
95680	99920	What did you find, nigga? I'm pressing it! I'm pressing it!
99920	105840	Now listen here, son. I know this meme stopped being dank after about week two and a half. I know
105840	110800	that the normies took this one over and killed Harambe for the second time. But come on, the sheer
110800	117120	magnitude of this meme cannot be ignored. If you ask random people to name one meme from 2016, I
117120	123200	guarantee you that the majority of them will say Harambe. And no matter how normified this meme
123200	128720	became down the line, you cannot deny its dank roots. I mean really, dicks out for Harambe?
128720	131280	What the fuck does that even mean? What does that mean?
132880	138560	It's dumb, it's offensive, it's absolutely disgusting. It's undoubtedly a dank meme.
138560	144080	Now whether you consider it the most normied dank meme or the most dank normie meme, one thing's
144080	150160	for sure, and that's that the legacy of Harambe will live on forever. It is a testament to the
150160	156240	power of memes which took an otherwise forgettable gorilla death and turned it into an unforgettable
156240	163200	worldwide phenomenon. And for that, Harambe gets the 10th spot on this list. Also, I made a Harambe
163200	173440	joke before it was cool. Let's turn back the clock to early 2015. All the major news outlets
173440	179280	are beginning murmurings of the early frontrunners for the 2016 presidential election. People like
179280	188400	Hillary Clinton, Chris Christie, Jeb Bush, and America's thinking, oh boy, another boring
188400	197360	election. Can't wait. When suddenly from out of nowhere, I am officially running for face god.
197360	201440	Now this happens in the summer of 2015 and at this point everyone just points and laughs at him.
201440	207040	Hahaha, another joke candidate like Mr. Potato Head or Deez Nuts. That's really funny. And at
207040	212800	this stage, that's all it really was to people, a joke. So you got this billionaire reality tv star
212800	218240	coming out and saying all this ridiculous bombastic stuff like, I will build a great,
218240	224880	great wall on our southern border and I will have Mexico pay for that wall. As if he were a
224880	230000	caricature of a Republican politician, just purposely saying whatever he can to piss off
230000	234800	as many people as possible. I mean his entire campaign strategy was just to troll the shit
234800	240240	out of his political opponents and the media and act like as much of an ass as possible. So yeah,
240240	246000	it was fucking hilarious because nobody thought he would actually succeed. Now flash forward
246000	251680	six months to the beginning of 2016. It turns out this guy is holding his own. He's actually
251680	257440	doing quite well in the polls, but he's running out of steam. Build a wall and overt xenophobia
257440	262480	can only piss people off for so long. Trump needed a new gimmick, a new angle so that he
262480	268720	could continue to stay on the cutting edge of relevancy. So he became a dank meme. My father
268720	273520	gave me a small loan of a million dollars. You see past presidential candidates have co-existed
273520	278640	with and even been subject to memes themselves, but never before has a candidate truly embraced
278640	283680	meme culture on the internet. A small loan of a million dollars was the first of a long line of
283680	290160	executive quality Trump brand memes. Think of all the great memes Trump gave us in the past year.
290160	296800	We got 7-eleven bing bing bong bong wrong grabbed by the person and my personal favorite autism has
296800	302160	become an epidemic. But it all started from a small soundbite about a small loan and for that
302160	310640	it gets a spot on this list. So if Trump was the meme lord candidate, Hillary was the fucking
310640	316000	meme antichrist. Say what you want about Trump, but he had the foresight to treat meme culture
316000	321280	with respect and because of that memes respected him. Hillary on the other hand decided to abuse
321280	325920	memes in a desperate attempt to appeal to a generation from which she is half a century
325920	329840	removed. Does anyone remember this gem? Pokemon go to the polls.
334240	337200	This right here is what caused Pokemon Go to lose all of its players.
341200	346800	A career politician who has never played a video game in her entire life trying to appear hip and
346800	352720	cool to the young people. I love the young people. Hillary fucking killed Pokemon Go.
353600	357200	And that's what happens whenever this woman touches a meme. She kills it
357200	360960	dead. But then she decided to fuck with the wrong meme.
366160	370640	You have got to be kidding me. Because in September of this year Hillary decided to
370640	377200	go after Pepe, the immortal most quintessential dank meme on the entire internet. Naturally Pepe
377200	382320	had partnered with the meme friendly candidate in Donald Trump. However, at a time when the rival
382320	387840	candidates were reaching unprecedented levels of animosity, Pepe ended up in Hillary's crosshairs.
387840	393360	In a completely unnecessary casualty to the endless mudslinging of this election, Pepe the
393360	400000	Frog, one of the most beloved and cherished dank memes of a generation, was officially labeled as
400000	407120	a hate symbol per the orders of the Clinton campaign. A hate symbol. So let's review shall
407120	416000	we. The swastika. Pepe the Frog. Cross burning. Pepe the Frog. Yeah I see no problems here. Those
416000	420720	those things are completely alike. And of course the endless liberal news stations picked up the
420720	425920	story and at this point they're strapping into full anti-Trump mode. So of course they would
425920	431280	support anything Hillary said or did no matter how asinine or poorly researched it actually was.
431280	436400	So in the eyes of the uninformed public Pepe is a hate symbol. And you know what maybe Pepe is a
436400	443040	hate symbol because it symbolizes how much us ascended meme lords hate fucking normal things
443040	449680	for ruining our dank memes. But alas Pepe's sacrifice was not in vain for it awoke a spirit
449680	454240	more powerful than Hillary Clinton or the normies could possibly imagine.
454240	467680	Okay so this meme is pretty low-key. You probably weren't expecting it here,
467680	472720	but that's part of the reason why it's so good. It's discreet. And if it's used correctly you
472720	476800	don't see it coming. That's really the main reason why this meme has been able to stay relatively
476800	481920	fresh over the months. Unless you watch it in a dedicated compilation which repeats the same
481920	488480	punchline over and over again completely defeating the humor in the meme. Anyway another
488480	493200	reason this meme is significant is because it's the first time that dank memes and progressive
493200	497600	rock have ever truly converged on such a large scale. And I know this meme technically originated
497600	505680	from an anime. And yes that does knock it down a few pegs in my book. But how can you deny the
505680	512560	importance of combining memes, one of the greatest products of the internet, with progressive rock,
512560	517520	one of the greatest genres of music? I feel like dank memes and progressive rock are kindred
517520	524080	spirits in a way. Both are buried under layers, layers, of less sophisticated normie friendly
524080	529680	surface media and they require quite a lot of digging to discover. However once you discover
529680	535040	them you will find a source of entertainment so dense and so rich that you'd be hard-pressed to
535040	547680	go back to normal media. Now unlike Harambe this meme stayed relatively dank during its time in
547680	552880	the spotlight. The concept of this meme is just so dumb I love it. It's simply just making iterated
552880	558560	edits to the intro of a poorly animated show that ran for only 16 episodes on some obscure TV
558560	564320	channel in the Philippines. Fuck the Philippines! You can't get much more obscure and dank than
564320	569280	that. So anyway this meme is pretty straightforward. What you do is you take the Nutshack theme but
569280	574240	replace each Nutshack with Smash Mouth's All-Star and you replace each All-Star with a Cyberchase
574240	579840	theme. Then replace every other syllable with the entirety of 2001 A Space Odyssey. And every time
579840	585680	the monolith appears, Bonzi Buddy reads the entire B movie script. But every time he says B it's
585680	590320	replaced with the entire Paul Blart movie. And every time someone says Paul Blart it's replaced
590320	595680	with John Cena's intro. Now as you can see we started off with a simple 60 second long intro
595680	600480	but after just a few operations we now have something longer than the entire age of the
600480	606720	observable universe. There are just so many layers. But anyway the Nutshack brought with it not just
606720	612560	a new meme but a new mode of remix culture. It introduced a new style of video remixing which
612560	617440	I like to call butt edits because most of the videos in this style have a subordinate clause
617440	622000	in their titles which begin with a conjunction butt. I guess a more technical term would be
622000	628800	iterative video remixes but come on butt edit has the word butt in it haha butts like the place
628800	636080	where you go poo haha hardy har har yeah I guess I'll just be killing myself then do it but I
636080	641760	digress. Thanks to the Nutshack meme we were able to witness the birth of an entirely new genre of
641760	647760	shitposting. What a monumental time to be alive. The Nutshack may not have been that big a meme by
647760	653760	itself but its impact on the entire face of the shitposting earth cannot be understated. The
653760	658880	Nutshack set into motion a transformative video movement that reached heights far greater than
658880	664320	the meme itself and for that it deserves its place in history and the number six spot on this list.
664320	670400	Well it looks like we're halfway done with the list which means it's time for the ad break remix.
670400	678880	falling out of wwe and hiding out in holes waiting for aaron to come people going home
680000	686560	jump out from behind them and shoot them with your rape now everybody dancing

778960	786080	what is up trawler nation i'm your host leafy is here popular youtuber has been blowing up
786080	791040	big time hey what's up guys it's leafy and it's been about three days since i fucked up but i
791040	796080	never thought i would say these words right a whole genre of youtubers of these kind of
796080	799760	commentary channels where they act innocent when they're really guilty of almost everything
799760	806720	they judge people on it because today is the day we get to bully keemstar i don't understand why
806720	810880	i'm still getting hate john tron is a fucking scumbag
817680	823520	2016 ladies and gentlemen was an unprecedented year in youtube drama and it brought with it a
823520	829200	lot of excellent fresh crispy decadent dank memes now don't get me wrong there's always been drama
829200	836000	on youtube youtubers calling out other youtubers fanboys attacking fanboys this stuff has been
836000	842000	going on since 2007 however there has never been youtube drama on the magnitude which we have seen
842000	847120	in 2016 where top level youtubers are at the center of it all this was the first year in which
847120	853200	youtube drama has become a main event spectacle rather than just a peripheral byproduct if you
853200	857520	go back to the days of guys like the archfiend calling out youtubers those videos did not get
857520	864480	that many views but flash forward to 2016 and youtuber call out and exposed videos frequently
864480	870000	get hundreds of thousands and in some cases millions of views youtube drama in any form
870000	876960	became a hot commodity this year now why is that well i think it's indicative of a profound change
876960	882080	in how we as a society view youtubers if you go back to the days when people like ray william
882080	887200	johnson smosh and shane dawson were at the top of the site there always seemed to be something
887200	892400	a bit corporate and sterile about them that sort of disengaged them from the general viewer
892400	897760	it was just something so impersonal about them we sort of viewed their content like we view
897760	904480	television it was really detached from individual viewers what has changed since then is that modern
904480	909760	youtubers and especially commentary channels develop their audiences based on a personal
909760	914080	and ideological connection to their viewers therefore when one of these youtubers gets
914080	918560	attacked it pisses off a lot more people than it used to let's be honest when all
918560	922160	said and done nobody really cared about what happened to ray william johnson people didn't
922160	927360	sub to equals three to see ray they subbed him to see funny internet video compilations
927360	932720	but if you look at popular channels today many of these popular channels like h3 items leafy
932720	938320	keemstar and grade a have a large sect of fans that are head over heels in love with not just
938320	943360	their content but the content creators themselves if all this youtube drama is indicative of
943360	948560	anything it is that the public is beginning to perceive youtubers as more than just internet
948560	954640	personalities youtubers are beginning to resemble a new generation of celebrity and this is the
954640	961200	first year i can say where youtubers have truly felt big in internet culture and we have youtube
961200	973440	drama to thank for that so 2016 was largely a year of unexpected breakthroughs the inaro
973440	977920	dicaprio finally won an oscar the city of cleveland won their first sports championship
977920	983520	in 60 years the chicago cubs won their first world series since teddy russevelt was president
983520	986240	and vaporwave became a popular genre of music
991120	996720	so what we have here is this extremely obscure genre of media which remixes pre-existing content
996720	1001280	in order to completely modify and transform its tone and essentially create a completely
1001280	1007600	new audio visual experience hmm sounds kind of familiar doesn't it anyway through the power of
1007600	1013360	means vaporwave kind of became a major internet phenomenon this year macintosh plus 420 became
1013360	1018000	this year's youtube national anthem it's pretty surreal to see such an obscure art form become
1018000	1023680	so popular especially considering how vaporwave is thematically critical of mainstream culture
1023680	1028320	i don't know maybe mainstream culture is becoming more critical of mainstream culture i mean just
1028320	1032800	look at how people reacted to this year's youtube rewind most people were dissatisfied with it
1032800	1038160	calling it the worst rewind ever but i don't think it's a matter of youtube making an inferior
1038160	1043760	product to last year's rewind quality-wise they're about the same the real reason that this year's
1043760	1049760	rewind was perceived so poorly is that youtube itself has changed so much in the past year
1049760	1055520	that the same formulaic inoffensive product from last year has become severely misrepresentative
1055520	1062080	of youtube as a whole in 2016 excluding people like filthy frank in 2015 only really alienated
1062080	1068640	a small fringe minority of youtube audiences who crave more vulgar and mature content but since
1068640	1074480	that time that small fringe group has grown into a pretty significant force on this website and
1074480	1080960	excluding people like h3 items and leafy this year alienated a much larger group all of these channels
1080960	1087040	practically sprung up from out of nowhere in 2016 and they represented a large group of viewers who
1087040	1091840	prefer more edgy content than minecraft let's plays you may not like some of these channels
1091840	1096640	but trying to act like these channels did not have a major influence on youtube in 2016 is just flat
1096640	1102800	out ignorant so that's my theory on why the youtube rewind seems so poor this year the rewind hasn't
1102800	1108320	changed but youtube has people are growing tired of the same old stuff and are searching for newer
1108320	1113120	fresher more original content i believe this is the reason why stuff like vaporwave and dank memes
1113120	1117680	have become so popular this year and out of everything i've mentioned in this video this
1117680	1122800	division that is formed among the youtube viewer base is the only thing i can really say that will
1122800	1129040	continue to grow in relevance heading into 2017 stuff like this doesn't just go away some serious
1129040	1135120	seas have been planted for a revolution in how we view popular content on this website and it may
1135120	1142080	have already begun it's real easy just when we look at memes we usually see something silly
1142080	1147520	something for a quick burst of humor to get us through the day but what if i told you that memes
1147520	1152960	could be a force for good so for some reason lazytown memes run on some sort of cycle where
1152960	1158480	they fall in and out of relevancy every few years or so downward cycle previous examples included
1158480	1168240	the likes of being a pirate illegal downloading stop it already anyway 2016 saw the cycle complete
1168240	1179680	yet another rotation with the popularization of what resulted was a continuation of the nutshack
1179680	1184240	inspired butt edits and this meme really took the genre to new heights in both popularity and
1184240	1189200	technical editing skill but underneath all the random and ridiculous remixing was a truly
1189200	1194880	enduring story it turns out that stefan carl the actor who plays robbie rotten in lazytown was
1194880	1199600	recently diagnosed with cancer which required him to undergo surgery the recovery process forced him
1199600	1204560	out of action for a year so some of his associates set up a gofundme page on his behalf to help him
1204560	1209600	out little did they know that this small request would end up harnessing the power of memes to
1209600	1215600	become one of the most charitable events in 2016 raising over 100 000 for stefan's recovery
1215600	1222560	this was an unprecedented event never before has a dank meme been used to mobilize a charitable
1222560	1227360	effort of this scale i will admit that this event is similar to the ice bucket challenge from a
1227360	1232560	couple of years ago but i categorize that as more of a social trend and not a meme the ice bucket
1232560	1236880	challenge also became kind of tarnished because down the stretch people began to do it just
1236880	1241440	because it was trendy while ignoring the charitable cause i feel like the we are number one meme
1241440	1246880	movement has been a lot more genuine in its charitable intent while also showcasing some of
1246880	1251760	the most creative editing talents that youtube has to offer what began is just another meme quickly
1251760	1256640	became one of the biggest feel-good stories of the entire year it demonstrated that some silly
1256640	1261920	memes on the internet have the power to do some serious good in real life and for that it deserves
1261920	1270800	a spot this high on the list ask yourself this what single meme best defines the 2016 dank meme
1270800	1278480	revolution as a whole no it's not harambe the true mascot of 2016 memory is the one the only
1278480	1279840	the lord the savior
1285280	1292560	here come dat boy it's a gif of a frog riding a unicycle what's not to like but then again
1292560	1299440	what is to like why did this completely inert illogical idiotic objectively unfunny meme come
1299440	1304800	from basically out of nowhere and blow up into the most popular internet meme in just a couple
1304800	1309760	of days why do we need yet another frog meme isn't it completely unnecessary why does a frog
1309760	1316000	riding a unicycle resonate so well with black people twitter well uh i think when it comes to
1316000	1322720	dank memes like dat boy and all the ones i've included in this list in order to fully enjoy them
1322720	1328720	rather than asking why you should instead ask yourself why not why not why not why not if the
1328720	1336080	year 2016 has taught us anything it's that we should not just expect the unexpected but
1336080	1342400	unexpected the expected there is no conceivable reason why dat boy should have become a popular
1342400	1349360	meme but that's exactly why it did unbeknownst to all of us dat boy actually foreshadowed all
1349360	1355280	the weird shit that happened later this year it embodies the complete disruption of conventional
1355280	1360880	logic in society that this year brought maybe the reason that that boy became so popular is
1360880	1366560	because society itself is beginning to think differently consider this could dat boy have
1366560	1373840	become a popular meme 10 5 or even 2 years ago it's hard to tell for sure but if you just look
1373840	1380000	at the most popular memes from those eras nothing even comes close to the level of dank on which
1380000	1386320	dat boy lies the internet in 2016 is very different from how it was in 2011 information
1386320	1391760	propagates so much faster every thought is more instantaneous than the last memes like dat boy
1391760	1396640	reach insane levels of popularity but can only maintain those levels for a short amount of time
1396640	1402480	before they fall out of relevancy downward spiral downward spiral downward spiral the meteoric rise
1402480	1407440	and fall of dat boy reminds me of the careers of talented artists such as kurt cobain who reached
1407440	1414400	incredible heights and set entirely new paradigms in their medium truly brilliant in the moment but
1414400	1422240	that moment ends so quickly that boy died a horrible painful cringy death of oversaturation
1422240	1428320	by normies but despite its fleeting time in relevancy dat boy could potentially be one of
1428320	1434880	the most important memes of our generation that boy is so significant not because it was the
1434880	1439600	funniest meme not because it was the most relatable meme that boy is significant because
1439600	1446400	it changed the way that we as an internet society view memes it's no longer necessary for popular
1446400	1452800	memes to be completely logical or contain an obvious punchline dat boy showed us that anything
1452800	1458880	can become a popular meme and because of it meme culture will never be the same again now before
1458880	1462880	we get to the number one dank meme of 2016 here are some honorable mentions
1471040	1476880	i have crippling depression jesus christ that's jason born i'm rick harrison and this is my
1476880	1478880	pawn shop make a nation
1483280	1489920	i do not associate with mega faggot get the fuck out of my room i'm playing minecraft
1489920	1495360	i'll have two number nines this one player keeps kicking my ass is it the legend 27 enough
1498560	1502880	we are number one
1507280	1508880	there has been an awakening
1514800	1515760	have you felt it
1523840	1528800	the controversy surrounding the idea of the social justice warrior and the regressive left
1528800	1534000	has been swirling for just over two years now this whole debate essentially comes down to critiquing
1534000	1539920	radical liberal viewpoints that were previously unchecked in internet discussion starting in 2014
1539920	1546000	the anti-social justice movement was picking up some momentum for sure but by early 2016 it was
1546000	1550400	just another one of the thousands of different political viewpoints on the internet people on the
1550400	1555760	internet generally have a level of stubbornness which cannot be penetrated by conventional logical
1555760	1561520	arguments new ideas and ways of thinking need a little extra push to expand beyond this level and
1561520	1567600	change people's minds people need to be able to consume the idea in an easily recognizable image
1567600	1584640	or symbol this sounds like a job for memes specifically triggered began to embody the
1584640	1590400	entire anti-social justice movement with just a single label it's such a simple and straightforward
1590400	1596240	meme essentially just another way of calling someone angry so why is it the number one dank
1596240	1603120	meme of 2016 well its simplicity caused the meme to spread and along with it the ideas of anti-social
1603120	1608480	justice all of us thought we were just spreading a funny meme but what we were really doing is
1608480	1614480	swinging the ideological pendulum of the internet ever so farther away from the left there's been a
1614480	1619520	pretty big elephant in the room hovering over this video you all know what it is and this whole video
1619520	1623760	has been leading up to it so far in this list i've written over 3500 words analyzing and
1623760	1630320	speculating fucking memes and i'm getting pretty tired so all i'm gonna say is this recently i saw
1630320	1635360	the movie arrival and one scene stuck out to me in which the main characters discuss a theory where
1635360	1642080	the type of language you speak can affect the way you think so that got me wondering memes are sort
1642080	1648480	of like an internet language they are capable of communicating meaning between people and that made
1648480	1654640	me ask the question what if what if the memes we use have a greater influence on our behavior than
1654640	1661280	we think what if a meme could ever so slightly shift society's political views to the right
1661280	1668160	what if a dank meme revolution just so happened to unfold during a presidential election year
1668160	1673600	in which the right-wing candidate is much more meme friendly than the left-wing candidate and
1673600	1678560	what if memes could sway just enough votes to the right-wing candidate so that he could
1678560	1684320	unexpectedly win critical swing states necessary for him to win the presidential election
1689440	1694560	there's been an awakening all right people have disrespected and abused the power of memes for
1694560	1701200	too long the dank tension has been building and rising for years and in 2016 it reached the
1701200	1707040	boiling point it just needed a little push to set it over the edge and when hillary rod and clinton
1707040	1713360	forsake pepe for political gain she awoke an ancient meme force so powerful that it changed
1713360	1719760	the course of human society forever the cult of keck has been unleashed from its dormancy
1719760	1725120	an entire year of joking around about memes has reared its head and now a dank meme has been
1725120	1731120	elected president of the united states and it doesn't matter who you call triggered anymore
1731120	1737680	because all of us have triggered a dank meme ascension the likes of which we couldn't even imagine
1737680	1750240	but hey that's just a theory a meme theory thanks for unsubscribing
1767680	1769140	you
