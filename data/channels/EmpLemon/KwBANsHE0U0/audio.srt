00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
What's up guys? So it's always been a dream of mine to become a pro YouTube gamer.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:12,000
So today I'm coming at you with a fresh new gameplay commentary.

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Now the game we're going to be playing today just came out.

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,000
There's tons of hype surrounding it. It's a class-based first-person shooter.

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:24,000
It's TF2. Why would it be anything other than TF2?

6
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:29,000
I can just get a clear shot! Oh, a headshot!

7
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Oh, epic sentry kill!

8
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Oh, mid-dude! Oh, a headshot!

9
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Whoa, this guy has a cool font in his name. How do you do that?

10
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Fucking McJuggins?

11
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Hey there Juggies, it's your old pal McJuggins.

12
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Should I take it? I'm going to take it.

13
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Alright, let's see what this black box can do.

14
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,000
I don't like the way you said black box.

15
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:08,000
What's up guys, and welcome to another Team Fortress 2 gameplay commentary.

16
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Team Fortress.

17
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Wait, is this the same spy? Ah!

18
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,000
RKO out of nowhere! RKO!

19
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Hey, we were getting stomped last round, so...

20
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Tables have turned.

21
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Oh god, no, he's going to kill me! Ah!

22
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Like, auto-balance!

23
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Tables have turned.

24
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Ayy, oh wait, let's use him now.

25
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
The tables are turning!

26
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Can you feel the tables?

27
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,000
The tables turned so hard that you launched me.

28
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
The fucking tables!

29
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Look at the tables! Ah!

30
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
That table didn't turn.

31
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,000
I don't want to live on this planet anymore.

32
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Hey there Juggies, it's your old pal McJuggins.

33
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Fucking McJuggins.

34
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
God, I can't hit him.

35
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
McJuggins! Damn you McJuggins!

36
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Thanks for the dispenser, bro.

37
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
You're just awesome, man.

38
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Really good dispenser, buddy.

39
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Ooh, sorry about that.

40
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Oh my god, this medic!

41
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Ah! Look at this medic!

42
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Stand back to the...

43
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,000
No sign of intelligent life, is there not?

44
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Whoa, whoa, what's over here?

45
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,000
I'll find your super medic when I can.

46
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
What's over here?

47
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Aw, man.

48
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Look.

49
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
It's in this room.

50
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
What is that room for?

51
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
It's me, Austin!

52
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Aw, son of a bitch!

53
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Amazing legendary spy who has senpai in his name.

54
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:04,000
What the fuck is this anime shit? Get that off the screen.

55
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Oh my god, Cleveland is just destroying Toronto.

56
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:13,000
It's just like the Cleveland Cavalier is hunched over the Toronto Raptors,

57
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:17,000
just letting out a giant Cleveland steamer.

58
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Ah! Headshots, ah!

59
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Oh my god!

60
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Hey there, Juggies, it's your old pal McJuggins!

61
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Okay, um...

62
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Where'd he go? Wait, what?

63
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Pyro?

64
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Okay...

65
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Um...

66
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Wait, fuck, he's got unusuals. What am I supposed to do?

67
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Alright, gums up! Let's do this!

68
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:48,000
And feel the power!

69
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Down goes Fraser! Down goes Fraser!

70
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Ah!

71
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
It doesn't matter what he's got.

72
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Get fucking back burned!

73
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Get back burned!

74
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Alright, who's next?

75
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
You're next!

76
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Ah!

77
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Ooh, that's a lot of people.

78
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Ah-ha!

79
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Ah-ha!

80
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Look who's taunting! Oh!

81
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Oh god!

82
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
This is bad!

83
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Fucking bad!

84
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Oh god! Oh god!

85
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
They're chasing me!

86
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Oh! Bad assist! I did four! Four!

87
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
I'm not gonna fight you.

88
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Ooh, this is not a safe space.

89
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
This is not a safe space.

90
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
This is not a safe space.

91
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Ah!

92
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:00,000
I am going to tear down your safe space!

93
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
I'll take care of him, Jenny!

94
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,000
You can't ruin our lives, reality!

95
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Our safe space will keep you out!

96
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Rot!

97
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Just kidding, I'll tear that out real quick.

98
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Shut the fuck up!

99
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Ah.

100
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Oh.

101
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Oh, you wanna fight?

102
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Oh.
