00:00.000 --> 00:07.000
What's up guys? So it's always been a dream of mine to become a pro YouTube gamer.

00:07.000 --> 00:12.000
So today I'm coming at you with a fresh new gameplay commentary.

00:12.000 --> 00:15.000
Now the game we're going to be playing today just came out.

00:15.000 --> 00:19.000
There's tons of hype surrounding it. It's a class-based first-person shooter.

00:19.000 --> 00:24.000
It's TF2. Why would it be anything other than TF2?

00:25.000 --> 00:29.000
I can just get a clear shot! Oh, a headshot!

00:30.000 --> 00:33.000
Oh, epic sentry kill!

00:33.000 --> 00:38.000
Oh, mid-dude! Oh, a headshot!

00:46.000 --> 00:49.000
Whoa, this guy has a cool font in his name. How do you do that?

00:49.000 --> 00:51.000
Fucking McJuggins?

00:51.000 --> 00:53.000
Hey there Juggies, it's your old pal McJuggins.

00:53.000 --> 00:55.000
Should I take it? I'm going to take it.

00:55.000 --> 00:58.000
Alright, let's see what this black box can do.

00:58.000 --> 01:01.000
I don't like the way you said black box.

01:02.000 --> 01:08.000
What's up guys, and welcome to another Team Fortress 2 gameplay commentary.

01:09.000 --> 01:12.000
Team Fortress.

01:13.000 --> 01:16.000
Wait, is this the same spy? Ah!

01:17.000 --> 01:20.000
RKO out of nowhere! RKO!

01:20.000 --> 01:22.000
Hey, we were getting stomped last round, so...

01:22.000 --> 01:24.000
Tables have turned.

01:30.000 --> 01:32.000
Oh god, no, he's going to kill me! Ah!

01:32.000 --> 01:34.000
Like, auto-balance!

01:34.000 --> 01:35.000
Tables have turned.

01:35.000 --> 01:37.000
Ayy, oh wait, let's use him now.

01:37.000 --> 01:39.000
The tables are turning!

01:39.000 --> 01:41.000
Can you feel the tables?

01:41.000 --> 01:44.000
The tables turned so hard that you launched me.

01:44.000 --> 01:46.000
The fucking tables!

01:46.000 --> 01:48.000
Look at the tables! Ah!

01:48.000 --> 01:50.000
That table didn't turn.

01:50.000 --> 01:53.000
I don't want to live on this planet anymore.

01:58.000 --> 02:00.000
Hey there Juggies, it's your old pal McJuggins.

02:00.000 --> 02:02.000
Fucking McJuggins.

02:02.000 --> 02:04.000
God, I can't hit him.

02:04.000 --> 02:06.000
McJuggins! Damn you McJuggins!

02:06.000 --> 02:08.000
Thanks for the dispenser, bro.

02:08.000 --> 02:10.000
You're just awesome, man.

02:11.000 --> 02:14.000
Really good dispenser, buddy.

02:26.000 --> 02:29.000
Ooh, sorry about that.

02:31.000 --> 02:33.000
Oh my god, this medic!

02:33.000 --> 02:35.000
Ah! Look at this medic!

02:35.000 --> 02:37.000
Stand back to the...

02:39.000 --> 02:42.000
No sign of intelligent life, is there not?

02:42.000 --> 02:44.000
Whoa, whoa, what's over here?

02:44.000 --> 02:47.000
I'll find your super medic when I can.

02:47.000 --> 02:48.000
What's over here?

02:48.000 --> 02:50.000
Aw, man.

02:50.000 --> 02:52.000
Look.

02:52.000 --> 02:54.000
It's in this room.

02:54.000 --> 02:55.000
What is that room for?

02:55.000 --> 02:57.000
It's me, Austin!

02:57.000 --> 02:58.000
Aw, son of a bitch!

02:58.000 --> 03:01.000
Amazing legendary spy who has senpai in his name.

03:01.000 --> 03:04.000
What the fuck is this anime shit? Get that off the screen.

03:04.000 --> 03:08.000
Oh my god, Cleveland is just destroying Toronto.

03:08.000 --> 03:13.000
It's just like the Cleveland Cavalier is hunched over the Toronto Raptors,

03:13.000 --> 03:17.000
just letting out a giant Cleveland steamer.

03:17.000 --> 03:19.000
Ah! Headshots, ah!

03:19.000 --> 03:20.000
Oh my god!

03:20.000 --> 03:23.000
Hey there, Juggies, it's your old pal McJuggins!

03:24.000 --> 03:25.000
Okay, um...

03:25.000 --> 03:27.000
Where'd he go? Wait, what?

03:27.000 --> 03:28.000
Pyro?

03:30.000 --> 03:32.000
Okay...

03:32.000 --> 03:34.000
Um...

03:36.000 --> 03:40.000
Wait, fuck, he's got unusuals. What am I supposed to do?

03:41.000 --> 03:44.000
Alright, gums up! Let's do this!

03:44.000 --> 03:48.000
And feel the power!

03:51.000 --> 03:54.000
Down goes Fraser! Down goes Fraser!

03:54.000 --> 03:55.000
Ah!

03:55.000 --> 03:56.000
It doesn't matter what he's got.

03:56.000 --> 03:57.000
Get fucking back burned!

03:57.000 --> 03:59.000
Get back burned!

03:59.000 --> 04:00.000
Alright, who's next?

04:00.000 --> 04:01.000
You're next!

04:01.000 --> 04:02.000
Ah!

04:06.000 --> 04:08.000
Ooh, that's a lot of people.

04:08.000 --> 04:09.000
Ah-ha!

04:09.000 --> 04:11.000
Ah-ha!

04:11.000 --> 04:13.000
Look who's taunting! Oh!

04:14.000 --> 04:15.000
Oh god!

04:16.000 --> 04:17.000
This is bad!

04:18.000 --> 04:19.000
Fucking bad!

04:22.000 --> 04:23.000
Oh god! Oh god!

04:25.000 --> 04:26.000
They're chasing me!

04:32.000 --> 04:37.000
Oh! Bad assist! I did four! Four!

04:37.000 --> 04:39.000
I'm not gonna fight you.

04:40.000 --> 04:43.000
Ooh, this is not a safe space.

04:43.000 --> 04:44.000
This is not a safe space.

04:44.000 --> 04:46.000
This is not a safe space.

04:56.000 --> 04:57.000
Ah!

04:57.000 --> 05:00.000
I am going to tear down your safe space!

05:01.000 --> 05:03.000
I'll take care of him, Jenny!

05:04.000 --> 05:07.000
You can't ruin our lives, reality!

05:07.000 --> 05:09.000
Our safe space will keep you out!

05:09.000 --> 05:10.000
Rot!

05:10.000 --> 05:12.000
Just kidding, I'll tear that out real quick.

05:12.000 --> 05:14.000
Shut the fuck up!

05:15.000 --> 05:16.000
Ah.

05:16.000 --> 05:17.000
Oh.

05:17.000 --> 05:19.000
Oh, you wanna fight?

05:19.000 --> 05:20.000
Oh.
