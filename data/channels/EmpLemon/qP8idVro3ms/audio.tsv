0	6080	Let me take you all back to the year 2009, back when YouTube looked like this and memes looked
6080	12880	like this. This was a time before dank memes, before MLG memes. This was a time when YouTube
12880	19120	poops reigned supreme. So many legendary poops came out around this time. Who could forget
19120	25680	classics like Toys Gone Wild, Freddy Ruins Sam's Life, and Hank of the Hill? YouTube poop was at
25680	30960	the peak of its cultural relevance and it would go on to inspire the editing styles of some of
30960	39680	the biggest YouTubers of today. There's an old legend in the YTP community that not many others
39680	46720	know about. It's a tale of the most glorious day in YTP history, about how one man literally broke
46720	52720	YouTube in the name of shitposting. Nowadays we would have called it cancer, but in 2009,
52720	59440	antics like this went by a different name, AIDS. This is the story of May AIDS.
60480	64480	Scientists at the National Centers for Disease Control released the results of a
64480	70240	study which shows that the lifestyle of some male homosexuals has triggered an epidemic.
70240	77760	A-I-D-S. AIDS. The most frightening initials in America today.
90880	95520	Not much is known about the YouTube pooper May AIDS. I never knew the guy. I missed him by a
95520	101120	couple of years. I only heard about him from the stories from way back in the day. May AIDS was
101120	106240	someone that casual YouTube viewers never knew about. Searching for him on Google today yields
106240	111600	only a couple thousand results. There just isn't that much information out there about May.
111600	116000	But using what little I could find, I was able to piece together this much about him.
116000	126640	In order to know about May AIDS, you had to be in the loop of the YTP community. He was a fairly
126640	132160	enigmatic user in the early days of YouTube, the YouTube Poop Forums. He was most active on
132160	138320	YouTube from 2007 to 2008, but his videos never really got that much attention, mostly because
138320	143040	he never really stayed in one place for long. I say that because he had about a dozen accounts
143040	147760	banned from YouTube, and those are just the ones we know about. The only May videos you can find
147760	153920	today are re-uploads, some from as far back as 2007. From what I can tell, May AIDS's style was
153920	158640	very chaotic and unpredictable, much like the individual himself. He was one of the first
158640	163920	poopers to employ the technique of sentence mixing. I need that cock he's wearing so I don't suck
163920	170160	tits. How come Robotnik's badniks wanted to catch you more than they wanted to catch herpes?
170160	176080	He also made a lot of sex jokes, which would explain his reportedly degenerate taste for anime,
176080	183200	furries, anime furries, and anime furry porn. The name May can actually be traced back to May the
183200	189040	Goat from the film Arashi no Yoru ni, which is an anime about furries that he used as a source in
189040	194800	his early YTPs. And despite making pretty decent and well-respected YouTube Poops for the time,
194800	200000	May AIDS was not simply satisfied with resting on his laurels. May AIDS never got attention for
200000	205360	his videos. No, no, no. Quite the opposite actually. May never went into making YouTube
205360	211200	videos for the fame. He was in it for the flames. May quickly established himself as the most
211200	217360	notorious troll in YTP history. There was this one time when May fabricated an entire account
217360	223040	and persona called Toby Said It just to troll the YTP community. You see, back in 2009 there would
223040	229680	be all these anti-YTP people who would pop up and make terrible rant videos on their 240p webcams,
229680	234960	and YouTube Poopers would always troll them in response. So May AIDS basically took this concept
234960	240720	and decided to troll the trolls. He intentionally made a bunch of stupid controversial rants,
240720	246560	got attention, baited a bunch of angry comments, and in the end he revealed that he was actually
246560	259200	May AIDS the whole time. And then he closed the account. That's just the kind of guy May was.
259200	265440	He was sort of this renegade meta troll. He didn't care about loyalty or community or taking sides.
265440	270720	He just kind of did whatever he felt like to see if he could. And wherever May went, he seemed to
270720	277520	leave a trail of chaos and confusion. His accounts on YouTube and YouTube got banned so frequently
277520	282800	that it was really tough to pin down exactly who May was at any given time. Couple that with a
282800	287760	boatload of impersonators and alt accounts and you have the veil for one of the most mysterious
287760	294000	figures in the YTP community. He was kind of ethereal in that way. He was both everywhere and
294000	299520	nowhere at the same time. May's antics pretty much only remained within the realm of YTP,
299520	305280	an obscure hidden micro community in a vast sea of content. But what if I told you that one day,
305280	311280	for one glorious moment, May AIDS reached a level of trolling that shouldn't have been possible.
312160	315920	While everybody was relaxing at home and enjoying their winter vacations,
315920	318720	something very strange was happening on YouTube.
341280	371200	So what in the world was going on here? Well the truth is that YouTube got hacked.
371520	377200	And May AIDS was responsible. But how do we know that? YouTube was the fourth biggest site on the
377200	382400	web at the time and a pretty big target. YouTube could have been hacked by anyone. So how do we
382400	390960	know it was May and not someone like the mysterious 4chan? Well first of all, many of the videos
390960	396560	involved in the hack were popular YouTube poops, a disproportionate amount. Additionally, one of the
396560	402960	hacked thumbnails was changed to an image of Conrad Slater, the founder of the YouTube forums.
402960	407200	Clearly, whoever was responsible was someone within the YouTube poop community.
408080	413280	The final and most compelling clue came from the images used in the hacked YouTube poops.
413280	418240	The thumbnails were changed to an image of a pink anime goat called Piano Chan,
418240	423600	which just so happened to be May's profile picture at the time. Some people still dispute whether or
423600	428880	not May actually executed the hack himself. Some have suggested that the hack was actually carried
428880	435280	out by a guy called ADHD Yoshi, May's partner in crime. Regardless of what actually happened,
435280	441520	May was certainly complicit in the hack at the very least. As far as I know, YouTube has never
441520	448240	experienced a hack of this spectacle ever since. Just imagine if something like this happened today.
448240	454160	Imagine if channels like Logan Paul, RiceGum, Jimmy Kimmel, and Taylor Swift had their thumbnails
454160	460080	changed to pink anime goats. It would have been a legendary and unforgettable event. But that's the
460080	465920	weird part though. An event of this magnitude did happen, but not many people seem to remember it.
465920	471280	Now why is that? Well, I think the lack of hype around this event truly demonstrates how drastically
471280	477360	YouTube has changed since 2009. When May hacked the thumbnails, YouTube did not have the tremendous
477360	483120	cultural impact that it possesses today. YouTube just wasn't that big because the internet wasn't
483120	487840	that big. And at the time, it was still a new frontier from which nobody really knew what to
487840	493040	expect. YouTube was much less strictly regulated back then and weird stuff just kind of happened
493040	498000	all the time. I guess one little thumbnail hack didn't seem too out of the ordinary back when
498000	504320	YouTube didn't really have an established norm. Nowadays, YouTube is a huge dominant platform that
504320	510000	every person, brand, and celebrity uses to try and snag their own little piece of fame.
510000	516080	YouTube has never had a more important role in society than it does now. Back in 2009, people
516080	522480	didn't really take YouTubers seriously. YouTubers were still viewed as amateur webcam geeks and
522480	528080	nobody thought they were particularly important individuals. Today, a YouTuber like Logan Paul
528080	534640	can make one mistake and receive global mainstream news attention. In 2009, big YouTubers weren't
534640	540240	hated nearly to the extent that they were today. YouTube drama is a relatively new concept and it
540240	546080	only existed as a small niche back in the day. I feel like the rising competitive culture of
546080	551760	modern YouTube has bred the drama which has elevated YouTubers to a much higher level of
551760	556720	relevance and modern YouTubers now face so much more scrutiny than their predecessors.
557280	562320	YouTube is no longer a wild west type free-for-all. It has become a legitimate,
562320	568720	strictly regulated business and brand reputation has never been more of a salient issue.
568720	574080	And with that being said, you can imagine the potential impact that a May AIDS thumbnail hack
574080	580720	could have today. Perhaps May would have been more nefarious in his thumbnail imagery. Imagine if May
580720	586320	had posted offensive or pornographic imagery on family-friendly YouTube brands. This had
586320	591280	the potential to be a huge controversy that could have cost YouTube millions of dollars,
591280	595680	but luckily for them, this oversight happened during an unimportant time
595680	598080	by a person who was just shitposting.
604160	609360	Personally, I can vaguely recall the pink anime goat in the thumbnails of a bunch of YouTube poops,
609360	614800	but I never really thought anything of it at the time. I figured it was just a weird YTP meme and
614800	620160	only later did I learn the true convoluted story behind it all. There used to be a video of May
620160	625520	AIDS allegedly performing the hack, but it has since been lost. While making this video, I tried
625520	630240	to use the internet wayback machine to find screenshots of the event taking place, but oddly
630240	635520	enough I couldn't find any archive of YouTube or the hacked channels during the dates on which the
635520	640320	hack took place. There just isn't that much documentation of this event out there on the web.
640320	645360	It almost feels like a dream in a way, like something that was all made up, just a tall
645360	650560	tale. But the Christmas thumbnail hack of 2009 really did happen, and there are still a few
650560	655680	surviving videos out there on YouTube right now with a hacked pink anime goat thumbnail.
655680	661680	You just have to know where to look. I think what puzzles me most about this incident is that May
661680	666560	just sort of got away with it. I mean he did get his account suspended, but for May that was a
666560	671520	weekly occurrence. So what's the big deal? After hacking the thumbnails of some of the biggest
671520	677360	channels on YouTube, May AIDS just went back to his typical YouTube Poop related shenanigans.
677360	682720	He stuck around for a few more years, and then around 2012, he vanished. Nobody really knows
682720	688240	what happened to him. Maybe he left YouTube for good. Maybe the FBI finally got him for all that
688240	694560	underage goat porn. But most likely, May probably just did what he did best. He opened an obscure
694560	699760	alt account that no one knew about and left everything behind. Perhaps he continues to lurk
699760	705760	among us to this day. An anonymous observer, forever a mystery, abandoning his only legacy
705760	713200	to fade away and, in time, be forgotten. There is one last thing May AIDS did under his name.
713200	718720	Some YouTuber wanted to make sure May AIDS was not forgotten, so they tried compiling all this May
718720	724400	footage scattered across YouTube onto one account known simply as the May AIDS Memorial. Then the
724400	729680	real May came back and submitted three fake copyright claims and terminated the account.
729680	733440	But what can I say? That's just the kind of guy May was.
