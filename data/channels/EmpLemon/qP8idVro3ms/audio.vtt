00:00.000 --> 00:06.080
Let me take you all back to the year 2009, back when YouTube looked like this and memes looked

00:06.080 --> 00:12.880
like this. This was a time before dank memes, before MLG memes. This was a time when YouTube

00:12.880 --> 00:19.120
poops reigned supreme. So many legendary poops came out around this time. Who could forget

00:19.120 --> 00:25.680
classics like Toys Gone Wild, Freddy Ruins Sam's Life, and Hank of the Hill? YouTube poop was at

00:25.680 --> 00:30.960
the peak of its cultural relevance and it would go on to inspire the editing styles of some of

00:30.960 --> 00:39.680
the biggest YouTubers of today. There's an old legend in the YTP community that not many others

00:39.680 --> 00:46.720
know about. It's a tale of the most glorious day in YTP history, about how one man literally broke

00:46.720 --> 00:52.720
YouTube in the name of shitposting. Nowadays we would have called it cancer, but in 2009,

00:52.720 --> 00:59.440
antics like this went by a different name, AIDS. This is the story of May AIDS.

01:00.480 --> 01:04.480
Scientists at the National Centers for Disease Control released the results of a

01:04.480 --> 01:10.240
study which shows that the lifestyle of some male homosexuals has triggered an epidemic.

01:10.240 --> 01:17.760
A-I-D-S. AIDS. The most frightening initials in America today.

01:30.880 --> 01:35.520
Not much is known about the YouTube pooper May AIDS. I never knew the guy. I missed him by a

01:35.520 --> 01:41.120
couple of years. I only heard about him from the stories from way back in the day. May AIDS was

01:41.120 --> 01:46.240
someone that casual YouTube viewers never knew about. Searching for him on Google today yields

01:46.240 --> 01:51.600
only a couple thousand results. There just isn't that much information out there about May.

01:51.600 --> 01:56.000
But using what little I could find, I was able to piece together this much about him.

01:56.000 --> 02:06.640
In order to know about May AIDS, you had to be in the loop of the YTP community. He was a fairly

02:06.640 --> 02:12.160
enigmatic user in the early days of YouTube, the YouTube Poop Forums. He was most active on

02:12.160 --> 02:18.320
YouTube from 2007 to 2008, but his videos never really got that much attention, mostly because

02:18.320 --> 02:23.040
he never really stayed in one place for long. I say that because he had about a dozen accounts

02:23.040 --> 02:27.760
banned from YouTube, and those are just the ones we know about. The only May videos you can find

02:27.760 --> 02:33.920
today are re-uploads, some from as far back as 2007. From what I can tell, May AIDS's style was

02:33.920 --> 02:38.640
very chaotic and unpredictable, much like the individual himself. He was one of the first

02:38.640 --> 02:43.920
poopers to employ the technique of sentence mixing. I need that cock he's wearing so I don't suck

02:43.920 --> 02:50.160
tits. How come Robotnik's badniks wanted to catch you more than they wanted to catch herpes?

02:50.160 --> 02:56.080
He also made a lot of sex jokes, which would explain his reportedly degenerate taste for anime,

02:56.080 --> 03:03.200
furries, anime furries, and anime furry porn. The name May can actually be traced back to May the

03:03.200 --> 03:09.040
Goat from the film Arashi no Yoru ni, which is an anime about furries that he used as a source in

03:09.040 --> 03:14.800
his early YTPs. And despite making pretty decent and well-respected YouTube Poops for the time,

03:14.800 --> 03:20.000
May AIDS was not simply satisfied with resting on his laurels. May AIDS never got attention for

03:20.000 --> 03:25.360
his videos. No, no, no. Quite the opposite actually. May never went into making YouTube

03:25.360 --> 03:31.200
videos for the fame. He was in it for the flames. May quickly established himself as the most

03:31.200 --> 03:37.360
notorious troll in YTP history. There was this one time when May fabricated an entire account

03:37.360 --> 03:43.040
and persona called Toby Said It just to troll the YTP community. You see, back in 2009 there would

03:43.040 --> 03:49.680
be all these anti-YTP people who would pop up and make terrible rant videos on their 240p webcams,

03:49.680 --> 03:54.960
and YouTube Poopers would always troll them in response. So May AIDS basically took this concept

03:54.960 --> 04:00.720
and decided to troll the trolls. He intentionally made a bunch of stupid controversial rants,

04:00.720 --> 04:06.560
got attention, baited a bunch of angry comments, and in the end he revealed that he was actually

04:06.560 --> 04:19.200
May AIDS the whole time. And then he closed the account. That's just the kind of guy May was.

04:19.200 --> 04:25.440
He was sort of this renegade meta troll. He didn't care about loyalty or community or taking sides.

04:25.440 --> 04:30.720
He just kind of did whatever he felt like to see if he could. And wherever May went, he seemed to

04:30.720 --> 04:37.520
leave a trail of chaos and confusion. His accounts on YouTube and YouTube got banned so frequently

04:37.520 --> 04:42.800
that it was really tough to pin down exactly who May was at any given time. Couple that with a

04:42.800 --> 04:47.760
boatload of impersonators and alt accounts and you have the veil for one of the most mysterious

04:47.760 --> 04:54.000
figures in the YTP community. He was kind of ethereal in that way. He was both everywhere and

04:54.000 --> 04:59.520
nowhere at the same time. May's antics pretty much only remained within the realm of YTP,

04:59.520 --> 05:05.280
an obscure hidden micro community in a vast sea of content. But what if I told you that one day,

05:05.280 --> 05:11.280
for one glorious moment, May AIDS reached a level of trolling that shouldn't have been possible.

05:12.160 --> 05:15.920
While everybody was relaxing at home and enjoying their winter vacations,

05:15.920 --> 05:18.720
something very strange was happening on YouTube.

05:41.280 --> 06:11.200
So what in the world was going on here? Well the truth is that YouTube got hacked.

06:11.520 --> 06:17.200
And May AIDS was responsible. But how do we know that? YouTube was the fourth biggest site on the

06:17.200 --> 06:22.400
web at the time and a pretty big target. YouTube could have been hacked by anyone. So how do we

06:22.400 --> 06:30.960
know it was May and not someone like the mysterious 4chan? Well first of all, many of the videos

06:30.960 --> 06:36.560
involved in the hack were popular YouTube poops, a disproportionate amount. Additionally, one of the

06:36.560 --> 06:42.960
hacked thumbnails was changed to an image of Conrad Slater, the founder of the YouTube forums.

06:42.960 --> 06:47.200
Clearly, whoever was responsible was someone within the YouTube poop community.

06:48.080 --> 06:53.280
The final and most compelling clue came from the images used in the hacked YouTube poops.

06:53.280 --> 06:58.240
The thumbnails were changed to an image of a pink anime goat called Piano Chan,

06:58.240 --> 07:03.600
which just so happened to be May's profile picture at the time. Some people still dispute whether or

07:03.600 --> 07:08.880
not May actually executed the hack himself. Some have suggested that the hack was actually carried

07:08.880 --> 07:15.280
out by a guy called ADHD Yoshi, May's partner in crime. Regardless of what actually happened,

07:15.280 --> 07:21.520
May was certainly complicit in the hack at the very least. As far as I know, YouTube has never

07:21.520 --> 07:28.240
experienced a hack of this spectacle ever since. Just imagine if something like this happened today.

07:28.240 --> 07:34.160
Imagine if channels like Logan Paul, RiceGum, Jimmy Kimmel, and Taylor Swift had their thumbnails

07:34.160 --> 07:40.080
changed to pink anime goats. It would have been a legendary and unforgettable event. But that's the

07:40.080 --> 07:45.920
weird part though. An event of this magnitude did happen, but not many people seem to remember it.

07:45.920 --> 07:51.280
Now why is that? Well, I think the lack of hype around this event truly demonstrates how drastically

07:51.280 --> 07:57.360
YouTube has changed since 2009. When May hacked the thumbnails, YouTube did not have the tremendous

07:57.360 --> 08:03.120
cultural impact that it possesses today. YouTube just wasn't that big because the internet wasn't

08:03.120 --> 08:07.840
that big. And at the time, it was still a new frontier from which nobody really knew what to

08:07.840 --> 08:13.040
expect. YouTube was much less strictly regulated back then and weird stuff just kind of happened

08:13.040 --> 08:18.000
all the time. I guess one little thumbnail hack didn't seem too out of the ordinary back when

08:18.000 --> 08:24.320
YouTube didn't really have an established norm. Nowadays, YouTube is a huge dominant platform that

08:24.320 --> 08:30.000
every person, brand, and celebrity uses to try and snag their own little piece of fame.

08:30.000 --> 08:36.080
YouTube has never had a more important role in society than it does now. Back in 2009, people

08:36.080 --> 08:42.480
didn't really take YouTubers seriously. YouTubers were still viewed as amateur webcam geeks and

08:42.480 --> 08:48.080
nobody thought they were particularly important individuals. Today, a YouTuber like Logan Paul

08:48.080 --> 08:54.640
can make one mistake and receive global mainstream news attention. In 2009, big YouTubers weren't

08:54.640 --> 09:00.240
hated nearly to the extent that they were today. YouTube drama is a relatively new concept and it

09:00.240 --> 09:06.080
only existed as a small niche back in the day. I feel like the rising competitive culture of

09:06.080 --> 09:11.760
modern YouTube has bred the drama which has elevated YouTubers to a much higher level of

09:11.760 --> 09:16.720
relevance and modern YouTubers now face so much more scrutiny than their predecessors.

09:17.280 --> 09:22.320
YouTube is no longer a wild west type free-for-all. It has become a legitimate,

09:22.320 --> 09:28.720
strictly regulated business and brand reputation has never been more of a salient issue.

09:28.720 --> 09:34.080
And with that being said, you can imagine the potential impact that a May AIDS thumbnail hack

09:34.080 --> 09:40.720
could have today. Perhaps May would have been more nefarious in his thumbnail imagery. Imagine if May

09:40.720 --> 09:46.320
had posted offensive or pornographic imagery on family-friendly YouTube brands. This had

09:46.320 --> 09:51.280
the potential to be a huge controversy that could have cost YouTube millions of dollars,

09:51.280 --> 09:55.680
but luckily for them, this oversight happened during an unimportant time

09:55.680 --> 09:58.080
by a person who was just shitposting.

10:04.160 --> 10:09.360
Personally, I can vaguely recall the pink anime goat in the thumbnails of a bunch of YouTube poops,

10:09.360 --> 10:14.800
but I never really thought anything of it at the time. I figured it was just a weird YTP meme and

10:14.800 --> 10:20.160
only later did I learn the true convoluted story behind it all. There used to be a video of May

10:20.160 --> 10:25.520
AIDS allegedly performing the hack, but it has since been lost. While making this video, I tried

10:25.520 --> 10:30.240
to use the internet wayback machine to find screenshots of the event taking place, but oddly

10:30.240 --> 10:35.520
enough I couldn't find any archive of YouTube or the hacked channels during the dates on which the

10:35.520 --> 10:40.320
hack took place. There just isn't that much documentation of this event out there on the web.

10:40.320 --> 10:45.360
It almost feels like a dream in a way, like something that was all made up, just a tall

10:45.360 --> 10:50.560
tale. But the Christmas thumbnail hack of 2009 really did happen, and there are still a few

10:50.560 --> 10:55.680
surviving videos out there on YouTube right now with a hacked pink anime goat thumbnail.

10:55.680 --> 11:01.680
You just have to know where to look. I think what puzzles me most about this incident is that May

11:01.680 --> 11:06.560
just sort of got away with it. I mean he did get his account suspended, but for May that was a

11:06.560 --> 11:11.520
weekly occurrence. So what's the big deal? After hacking the thumbnails of some of the biggest

11:11.520 --> 11:17.360
channels on YouTube, May AIDS just went back to his typical YouTube Poop related shenanigans.

11:17.360 --> 11:22.720
He stuck around for a few more years, and then around 2012, he vanished. Nobody really knows

11:22.720 --> 11:28.240
what happened to him. Maybe he left YouTube for good. Maybe the FBI finally got him for all that

11:28.240 --> 11:34.560
underage goat porn. But most likely, May probably just did what he did best. He opened an obscure

11:34.560 --> 11:39.760
alt account that no one knew about and left everything behind. Perhaps he continues to lurk

11:39.760 --> 11:45.760
among us to this day. An anonymous observer, forever a mystery, abandoning his only legacy

11:45.760 --> 11:53.200
to fade away and, in time, be forgotten. There is one last thing May AIDS did under his name.

11:53.200 --> 11:58.720
Some YouTuber wanted to make sure May AIDS was not forgotten, so they tried compiling all this May

11:58.720 --> 12:04.400
footage scattered across YouTube onto one account known simply as the May AIDS Memorial. Then the

12:04.400 --> 12:09.680
real May came back and submitted three fake copyright claims and terminated the account.

12:09.680 --> 12:13.440
But what can I say? That's just the kind of guy May was.
