00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,080
Let me take you all back to the year 2009, back when YouTube looked like this and memes looked

2
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:12,880
like this. This was a time before dank memes, before MLG memes. This was a time when YouTube

3
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:19,120
poops reigned supreme. So many legendary poops came out around this time. Who could forget

4
00:00:19,120 --> 00:00:25,680
classics like Toys Gone Wild, Freddy Ruins Sam's Life, and Hank of the Hill? YouTube poop was at

5
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:30,960
the peak of its cultural relevance and it would go on to inspire the editing styles of some of

6
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:39,680
the biggest YouTubers of today. There's an old legend in the YTP community that not many others

7
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:46,720
know about. It's a tale of the most glorious day in YTP history, about how one man literally broke

8
00:00:46,720 --> 00:00:52,720
YouTube in the name of shitposting. Nowadays we would have called it cancer, but in 2009,

9
00:00:52,720 --> 00:00:59,440
antics like this went by a different name, AIDS. This is the story of May AIDS.

10
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:04,480
Scientists at the National Centers for Disease Control released the results of a

11
00:01:04,480 --> 00:01:10,240
study which shows that the lifestyle of some male homosexuals has triggered an epidemic.

12
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:17,760
A-I-D-S. AIDS. The most frightening initials in America today.

13
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:35,520
Not much is known about the YouTube pooper May AIDS. I never knew the guy. I missed him by a

14
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:41,120
couple of years. I only heard about him from the stories from way back in the day. May AIDS was

15
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:46,240
someone that casual YouTube viewers never knew about. Searching for him on Google today yields

16
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:51,600
only a couple thousand results. There just isn't that much information out there about May.

17
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:56,000
But using what little I could find, I was able to piece together this much about him.

18
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:06,640
In order to know about May AIDS, you had to be in the loop of the YTP community. He was a fairly

19
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:12,160
enigmatic user in the early days of YouTube, the YouTube Poop Forums. He was most active on

20
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:18,320
YouTube from 2007 to 2008, but his videos never really got that much attention, mostly because

21
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:23,040
he never really stayed in one place for long. I say that because he had about a dozen accounts

22
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:27,760
banned from YouTube, and those are just the ones we know about. The only May videos you can find

23
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:33,920
today are re-uploads, some from as far back as 2007. From what I can tell, May AIDS's style was

24
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:38,640
very chaotic and unpredictable, much like the individual himself. He was one of the first

25
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:43,920
poopers to employ the technique of sentence mixing. I need that cock he's wearing so I don't suck

26
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:50,160
tits. How come Robotnik's badniks wanted to catch you more than they wanted to catch herpes?

27
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:56,080
He also made a lot of sex jokes, which would explain his reportedly degenerate taste for anime,

28
00:02:56,080 --> 00:03:03,200
furries, anime furries, and anime furry porn. The name May can actually be traced back to May the

29
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:09,040
Goat from the film Arashi no Yoru ni, which is an anime about furries that he used as a source in

30
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:14,800
his early YTPs. And despite making pretty decent and well-respected YouTube Poops for the time,

31
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:20,000
May AIDS was not simply satisfied with resting on his laurels. May AIDS never got attention for

32
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:25,360
his videos. No, no, no. Quite the opposite actually. May never went into making YouTube

33
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:31,200
videos for the fame. He was in it for the flames. May quickly established himself as the most

34
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:37,360
notorious troll in YTP history. There was this one time when May fabricated an entire account

35
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:43,040
and persona called Toby Said It just to troll the YTP community. You see, back in 2009 there would

36
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:49,680
be all these anti-YTP people who would pop up and make terrible rant videos on their 240p webcams,

37
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:54,960
and YouTube Poopers would always troll them in response. So May AIDS basically took this concept

38
00:03:54,960 --> 00:04:00,720
and decided to troll the trolls. He intentionally made a bunch of stupid controversial rants,

39
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:06,560
got attention, baited a bunch of angry comments, and in the end he revealed that he was actually

40
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:19,200
May AIDS the whole time. And then he closed the account. That's just the kind of guy May was.

41
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:25,440
He was sort of this renegade meta troll. He didn't care about loyalty or community or taking sides.

42
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:30,720
He just kind of did whatever he felt like to see if he could. And wherever May went, he seemed to

43
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:37,520
leave a trail of chaos and confusion. His accounts on YouTube and YouTube got banned so frequently

44
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:42,800
that it was really tough to pin down exactly who May was at any given time. Couple that with a

45
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:47,760
boatload of impersonators and alt accounts and you have the veil for one of the most mysterious

46
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:54,000
figures in the YTP community. He was kind of ethereal in that way. He was both everywhere and

47
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:59,520
nowhere at the same time. May's antics pretty much only remained within the realm of YTP,

48
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:05,280
an obscure hidden micro community in a vast sea of content. But what if I told you that one day,

49
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:11,280
for one glorious moment, May AIDS reached a level of trolling that shouldn't have been possible.

50
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:15,920
While everybody was relaxing at home and enjoying their winter vacations,

51
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:18,720
something very strange was happening on YouTube.

52
00:05:41,280 --> 00:06:11,200
So what in the world was going on here? Well the truth is that YouTube got hacked.

53
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:17,200
And May AIDS was responsible. But how do we know that? YouTube was the fourth biggest site on the

54
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:22,400
web at the time and a pretty big target. YouTube could have been hacked by anyone. So how do we

55
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:30,960
know it was May and not someone like the mysterious 4chan? Well first of all, many of the videos

56
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:36,560
involved in the hack were popular YouTube poops, a disproportionate amount. Additionally, one of the

57
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:42,960
hacked thumbnails was changed to an image of Conrad Slater, the founder of the YouTube forums.

58
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:47,200
Clearly, whoever was responsible was someone within the YouTube poop community.

59
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:53,280
The final and most compelling clue came from the images used in the hacked YouTube poops.

60
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:58,240
The thumbnails were changed to an image of a pink anime goat called Piano Chan,

61
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:03,600
which just so happened to be May's profile picture at the time. Some people still dispute whether or

62
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:08,880
not May actually executed the hack himself. Some have suggested that the hack was actually carried

63
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:15,280
out by a guy called ADHD Yoshi, May's partner in crime. Regardless of what actually happened,

64
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:21,520
May was certainly complicit in the hack at the very least. As far as I know, YouTube has never

65
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:28,240
experienced a hack of this spectacle ever since. Just imagine if something like this happened today.

66
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:34,160
Imagine if channels like Logan Paul, RiceGum, Jimmy Kimmel, and Taylor Swift had their thumbnails

67
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:40,080
changed to pink anime goats. It would have been a legendary and unforgettable event. But that's the

68
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:45,920
weird part though. An event of this magnitude did happen, but not many people seem to remember it.

69
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:51,280
Now why is that? Well, I think the lack of hype around this event truly demonstrates how drastically

70
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:57,360
YouTube has changed since 2009. When May hacked the thumbnails, YouTube did not have the tremendous

71
00:07:57,360 --> 00:08:03,120
cultural impact that it possesses today. YouTube just wasn't that big because the internet wasn't

72
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:07,840
that big. And at the time, it was still a new frontier from which nobody really knew what to

73
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:13,040
expect. YouTube was much less strictly regulated back then and weird stuff just kind of happened

74
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:18,000
all the time. I guess one little thumbnail hack didn't seem too out of the ordinary back when

75
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:24,320
YouTube didn't really have an established norm. Nowadays, YouTube is a huge dominant platform that

76
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:30,000
every person, brand, and celebrity uses to try and snag their own little piece of fame.

77
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:36,080
YouTube has never had a more important role in society than it does now. Back in 2009, people

78
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:42,480
didn't really take YouTubers seriously. YouTubers were still viewed as amateur webcam geeks and

79
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:48,080
nobody thought they were particularly important individuals. Today, a YouTuber like Logan Paul

80
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:54,640
can make one mistake and receive global mainstream news attention. In 2009, big YouTubers weren't

81
00:08:54,640 --> 00:09:00,240
hated nearly to the extent that they were today. YouTube drama is a relatively new concept and it

82
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:06,080
only existed as a small niche back in the day. I feel like the rising competitive culture of

83
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:11,760
modern YouTube has bred the drama which has elevated YouTubers to a much higher level of

84
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:16,720
relevance and modern YouTubers now face so much more scrutiny than their predecessors.

85
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:22,320
YouTube is no longer a wild west type free-for-all. It has become a legitimate,

86
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:28,720
strictly regulated business and brand reputation has never been more of a salient issue.

87
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:34,080
And with that being said, you can imagine the potential impact that a May AIDS thumbnail hack

88
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:40,720
could have today. Perhaps May would have been more nefarious in his thumbnail imagery. Imagine if May

89
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:46,320
had posted offensive or pornographic imagery on family-friendly YouTube brands. This had

90
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:51,280
the potential to be a huge controversy that could have cost YouTube millions of dollars,

91
00:09:51,280 --> 00:09:55,680
but luckily for them, this oversight happened during an unimportant time

92
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:58,080
by a person who was just shitposting.

93
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:09,360
Personally, I can vaguely recall the pink anime goat in the thumbnails of a bunch of YouTube poops,

94
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:14,800
but I never really thought anything of it at the time. I figured it was just a weird YTP meme and

95
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:20,160
only later did I learn the true convoluted story behind it all. There used to be a video of May

96
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:25,520
AIDS allegedly performing the hack, but it has since been lost. While making this video, I tried

97
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:30,240
to use the internet wayback machine to find screenshots of the event taking place, but oddly

98
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:35,520
enough I couldn't find any archive of YouTube or the hacked channels during the dates on which the

99
00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:40,320
hack took place. There just isn't that much documentation of this event out there on the web.

100
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:45,360
It almost feels like a dream in a way, like something that was all made up, just a tall

101
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:50,560
tale. But the Christmas thumbnail hack of 2009 really did happen, and there are still a few

102
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:55,680
surviving videos out there on YouTube right now with a hacked pink anime goat thumbnail.

103
00:10:55,680 --> 00:11:01,680
You just have to know where to look. I think what puzzles me most about this incident is that May

104
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:06,560
just sort of got away with it. I mean he did get his account suspended, but for May that was a

105
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:11,520
weekly occurrence. So what's the big deal? After hacking the thumbnails of some of the biggest

106
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:17,360
channels on YouTube, May AIDS just went back to his typical YouTube Poop related shenanigans.

107
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:22,720
He stuck around for a few more years, and then around 2012, he vanished. Nobody really knows

108
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:28,240
what happened to him. Maybe he left YouTube for good. Maybe the FBI finally got him for all that

109
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:34,560
underage goat porn. But most likely, May probably just did what he did best. He opened an obscure

110
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:39,760
alt account that no one knew about and left everything behind. Perhaps he continues to lurk

111
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:45,760
among us to this day. An anonymous observer, forever a mystery, abandoning his only legacy

112
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:53,200
to fade away and, in time, be forgotten. There is one last thing May AIDS did under his name.

113
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:58,720
Some YouTuber wanted to make sure May AIDS was not forgotten, so they tried compiling all this May

114
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:04,400
footage scattered across YouTube onto one account known simply as the May AIDS Memorial. Then the

115
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:09,680
real May came back and submitted three fake copyright claims and terminated the account.

116
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:13,440
But what can I say? That's just the kind of guy May was.
