1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,700
Earlier this summer, I picked up NASCAR Thunder 2004 from a local flea market for seven dollars.

2
00:00:05,860 --> 00:00:11,760
This game is regarded by NASCAR fans as the best NASCAR console release of all time.

3
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:15,800
A game that has not been topped more than 17 years after its release.

4
00:00:16,120 --> 00:00:22,480
When I played it, I was astounded at the amount of content and gameplay variety available in a 2003 game.

5
00:00:23,240 --> 00:00:25,480
Naturally, as we evaluate older media,

6
00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:30,200
you have to excuse a certain level of crappiness due to the technical limitations of the era.

7
00:00:30,520 --> 00:00:37,080
For example, a movie from 1982 is going to have significantly worse special effects than a movie in the present day,

8
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:41,160
so it's not really fair to judge older works along modern standards.

9
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:48,040
But just as we can forgive old media for their limitations, should we punish new media for a lack of progression?

10
00:00:49,160 --> 00:00:53,360
Imagine taking a time machine back to 2003 and telling NASCAR fans,

11
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:59,280
this game right here, this is as good as it's gonna get. It's all downhill from here.

12
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:04,520
They would have thought that an asteroid must have wiped out the human civilization in 2004,

13
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:09,520
because how could it be possible that despite the exponential growth in processing power,

14
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:12,880
and with the video game industry earning record revenue,

15
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:18,200
not a single company has managed to make a better game nearly two decades into the future.

16
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:22,960
I feel like NASCAR Thunder represents a disturbing trend in video games as a whole.

17
00:01:23,440 --> 00:01:27,440
In general, the last decade of games has been profoundly disappointing.

18
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:31,200
I want to clarify here that this is not my individual opinion,

19
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:35,840
rather the general consensus that I've perceived from the gaming community at large.

20
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:39,600
I feel like everyone entered the 2010s with such optimism.

21
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:47,440
So many of us were eagerly anticipating how the next-gen technology was going to completely transform the way we experienced our favorite games.

22
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:53,280
Half-Life, Fallout, Halo, Call of Duty, Mass Effect, World of Warcraft, Madden.

23
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:57,120
These franchises brought us some of the greatest games of the 2000s.

24
00:01:57,280 --> 00:02:01,680
Little did we know just how hard all of these beloved series would fall off a cliff.

25
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:07,680
I polled my audience on Twitter what they would prefer if they could only play games from one of these decades,

26
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:12,160
and remarkably, 45% of respondents chose the 2000s.

27
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:20,400
This means that nearly half of all people would be willing to give up the entire 8th generation of consoles and a significant portion of the 7th gen.

28
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:27,360
They would be willing to give up better graphics, better performance, most online multiplayer games, most of the games on Steam,

29
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:34,000
most games on the App Store or Google Play, the most popular indie games, seamless DLC and patches,

30
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:41,200
cloud storage, fully integrated competitive lobbying, VR, Xbox Kinect, Raid Shadow Legends.

31
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:46,080
They would be willing to give up all of this to go play Wii Sports and Club Penguin.

32
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:52,480
Despite all of our next-gen technology, many people feel that the games today simply aren't as good.

33
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:56,160
So with that being said, what happened to video games?

34
00:02:56,800 --> 00:03:01,600
The first and most obvious reason for this is the deterioration of game design.

35
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:06,400
15 years ago, you'd go to the store, purchase the game and own the finished product.

36
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:12,560
Then, somewhere along the way, companies figured out how to make players purchase the same game multiple times.

37
00:03:13,340 --> 00:03:22,080
Nowadays, game studios have become all too comfortable rushing out broken, unfinished products and just patching in the rest of the content in the years after release.

38
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:29,920
Couple that with charging for DLC, microtransactions and pay-to-win mechanics, and consumers end up spending more for less.

39
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:34,400
This issue has been discussed to death here on YouTube because it's inherently

40
00:03:34,780 --> 00:03:40,800
unsatisfying to pay full price for a game and not have it resemble a finished product until long after you've stopped caring.

41
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:47,300
This is a trend that's undoubtedly emerged over the past decade because if you released a broken game in the 2000s,

42
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:55,120
people just wouldn't buy it. But even worse than releasing broken games is releasing broken games with no intent on fixing them.

43
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:59,140
This has been a disastrous consequence of licensing at exclusivity.

44
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:04,400
And no other developer symbolizes this problem more than EA Sports.

45
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:12,900
Some of you today may find this hard to believe, but there was once a time when EA made great sports games like NASCAR Thunder 2004.

46
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:19,680
However, in just five years, EA went from releasing the best NASCAR console game of all time to one of the most

47
00:04:19,900 --> 00:04:28,100
universally hated games in the genre. What happened? Well, starting in 2003, EA bought out the exclusive rights to the NASCAR license.

48
00:04:28,420 --> 00:04:34,900
Prior to that, you had the NASCAR Heat and NASCAR Racing franchises all producing quality games alongside EA.

49
00:04:35,060 --> 00:04:41,060
The competition forced these developers to release great products. After EA bought out the license,

50
00:04:41,060 --> 00:04:47,460
they no longer had any incentive to outdo their competition, and the series slowly but surely deteriorated.

51
00:04:47,900 --> 00:04:55,500
A similar outcome happened to the Madden and FIFA franchises, with the only difference being that EA is still holding them hostage to this day.

52
00:04:55,900 --> 00:05:03,660
Couple that with 2K's recent string of duds, and we have entered a disturbing reality where there are practically no good sports games on the market.

53
00:05:04,140 --> 00:05:10,540
These games used to be an integral part of every console generation, and now they just seem to exist to fill shelf space.

54
00:05:12,220 --> 00:05:20,220
And due to the monopolistic nature of these licensing deals, it's unlikely that this trend will change anytime soon.

55
00:05:20,780 --> 00:05:26,540
Players will just keep buying the same mediocre game every year because if you want the newest game from your favorite sport,

56
00:05:26,860 --> 00:05:28,860
there are literally no other options.

57
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:35,660
Even without exclusive licenses, the overall selection of games over the past decade has felt rather limited.

58
00:05:35,980 --> 00:05:38,860
It's a phenomenon I call the death of the simple game.

59
00:05:39,340 --> 00:05:44,700
When I was a kid, I spent dozens of hours playing games like ATV 2, Midnight Club 3, Burnout 3.

60
00:05:45,020 --> 00:05:47,900
These were all what I consider simple, good games.

61
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:55,340
Solid, fun titles that didn't necessarily set the world on fire with innovation, but were still nice to have in your library.

62
00:05:55,820 --> 00:06:01,020
These were games that you could pick up and play for a couple of weeks and eventually revisit once a year or so.

63
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:10,140
Unfortunately, pretty much all these franchises died with a decade, and the 2010s were left with what felt like a huge void in good middle tier games.

64
00:06:10,700 --> 00:06:14,540
It seems like most games these days are created to fit one of two extremes.

65
00:06:14,940 --> 00:06:22,300
Either a crappy phone game you can play on the toilet, or a grandiose open world multiplayer battle royale with a 40-hour

66
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:24,640
cinematic story and epic cutscenes.

67
00:06:25,100 --> 00:06:31,680
I believe the shift towards the latter can be attributed to by far the most successful game of the 2010s, Minecraft.

68
00:06:34,540 --> 00:06:40,300
The meteoric rise of Minecraft led to a cataclysmic shift in what players expected out of a video game.

69
00:06:40,860 --> 00:06:44,380
The amount of unique gameplay possibilities was virtually unlimited,

70
00:06:44,860 --> 00:06:50,620
and it was not uncommon for players to dedicate hundreds, if not thousands of hours to this single game.

71
00:06:51,260 --> 00:06:56,060
The same is true for Minecraft's less respected, but equally popular cousin, Roblox.

72
00:06:56,760 --> 00:07:01,360
Previously, games like RuneScape and World of Warcraft would draw similar levels of dedication,

73
00:07:01,820 --> 00:07:08,220
but they didn't come close to the immense mainstream popularity that Minecraft and Roblox continued to hold to this day.

74
00:07:09,020 --> 00:07:15,840
All of the time spent on these two games is time that would have been shared among dozens of those smaller, simple games from the 2000s.

75
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:21,340
Unfortunately, this has made it difficult for studios to justify creating simple games,

76
00:07:21,820 --> 00:07:28,300
because why would someone pay for a new game when they can just stick to the unlimited gameplay variety in a game they already own?

77
00:07:28,700 --> 00:07:33,760
This all but forces modern publishers to release lazy free-to-play games riddled with microtransactions,

78
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:41,920
or haphazardly shove in as many bells and whistles as possible to create what is more often than not a disappointing and incoherent mess.

79
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:45,760
It's so dense. Every single image has so many things going on.

80
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:54,820
Another far-reaching consequence of Minecraft and Roblox is that they have forced every other game to prioritize online multiplayer,

81
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:58,260
which has, in turn, killed off local multiplayer.

82
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:03,680
Some of the most fun I had as a kid was playing Nintendo DS games on the bus before school.

83
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:08,980
The DS let you wirelessly connect to local multiplayer rooms without an internet connection,

84
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:14,000
and the best part was you could play games like Mario Kart without even owning the game yourself.

85
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:20,800
In my opinion, this was the peak of not just local multiplayer gaming, but handheld gaming, yet another genre

86
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:26,000
I used to really like that has gradually deteriorated over the past decade. Now don't get me wrong,

87
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:28,080
I don't hate online multiplayer.

88
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:33,860
My most played game of all time is Team Fortress 2, which is a strictly online multiplayer experience.

89
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:45,280
However, I'll be the first to admit that playing against random strangers online is simply not as fulfilling as playing alongside your friends and family

90
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:47,120
whom you see every day.

91
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:52,980
This has always been an essential part of what makes video games fun, going all the way back to the days of arcades.

92
00:08:53,460 --> 00:08:59,780
To be perfectly honest, the ability to play with anybody from around the world will always be impressive on a technical level,

93
00:09:00,100 --> 00:09:05,620
but the experience doesn't compare to the simple pleasures of just going to a friend's house to play Guitar Hero.

94
00:09:06,100 --> 00:09:09,640
The harsh reality of online multiplayer is that it's very impersonal.

95
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:14,740
Ironically, despite having the potential to connect us with an infinite number of people,

96
00:09:15,060 --> 00:09:18,680
online multiplayer has left us feeling more isolated than ever before.

97
00:09:19,380 --> 00:09:22,680
Most of the time, it just feels like you're playing against very good CPUs.

98
00:09:22,980 --> 00:09:26,420
Except they can trash talk you and call you bad for making a single mistake.

99
00:09:26,980 --> 00:09:29,300
With friends, it's all just casual banter,

100
00:09:29,300 --> 00:09:34,920
but with strangers, getting constantly flamed can turn a fun game into an incredibly frustrating experience.

101
00:09:35,380 --> 00:09:40,680
Because of this, it's not surprising why online multiplayer games tend to carry the most toxic communities.

102
00:09:41,220 --> 00:09:45,380
And as more studios shift away from local multiplayer in favor of online play,

103
00:09:45,700 --> 00:09:48,980
it's no wonder why games are starting to feel less fun in general.

104
00:09:49,460 --> 00:09:56,180
Speaking of which, the past decade has led to a significant portion of people who no longer engage with games for fun.

105
00:09:56,820 --> 00:10:02,120
In many aspects, video games have become serious business, both literally and figuratively.

106
00:10:02,820 --> 00:10:06,820
In a literal sense, the business of video games is seriously booming.

107
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:11,220
Recently, the gaming industry has become really good at making money,

108
00:10:11,540 --> 00:10:17,140
and the money-making process has made things less fun for consumers and really not fun for developers.

109
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:21,860
The ever-increasing thirst for profit has corporatized the business at large.

110
00:10:22,340 --> 00:10:27,460
Gone are the days of scrappy, passionate developers working to make their games the best that they can be.

111
00:10:28,100 --> 00:10:34,980
Modern-day devs toil feverishly to meet impossible deadlines and end up creating products that both they and their audience hate.

112
00:10:35,540 --> 00:10:40,500
Back in the day, this practice would manifest itself in the form of tacky, licensed shovelware,

113
00:10:40,900 --> 00:10:43,220
but some of these games ended up being pretty good.

114
00:10:43,780 --> 00:10:49,780
At least shovelware was far easier to avoid than the predatory business models currently infesting games today.

115
00:10:50,340 --> 00:10:57,240
Modern-day games are designed to be more addictive than fun and will not hesitate to take more of the player's money at every opportunity.

116
00:10:57,860 --> 00:11:02,020
For today's game companies, the only high score they care about is their profit margin.

117
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:05,780
It doesn't matter if games are good as long as they produce revenue.

118
00:11:06,260 --> 00:11:10,180
However, the business of video games now extends far beyond the publishers.

119
00:11:10,660 --> 00:11:17,140
Players can now go into business for themselves by making money from playing games on Twitch, YouTube, or as an esports competitor.

120
00:11:26,980 --> 00:11:30,980
Ladies and gentlemen, the dream of every kid growing up in the 2000s is real.

121
00:11:31,380 --> 00:11:34,360
But just like everything else, it wasn't at all what we expected.

122
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:41,400
As it turns out, playing games out of obligation rather than leisure is a great way to suck all the enjoyment out of whatever you're playing.

123
00:11:42,040 --> 00:11:49,560
This leads to highly uncomfortable situations where people like Wings of Redemption force themselves to be publicly humiliated on a regular basis

124
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:53,000
in a game they hate because it's the only way to pay his bills.

125
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:56,280
I'm already playing a game I don't want to play to get views.

126
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:02,680
I really wish I weren't here right now.

127
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:09,480
As for competitive play, there's no shortage of people who completely burn themselves out trying to grind out an extra dozen elo points.

128
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:15,480
When winning is the only thing that matters, the experience starts to quickly unravel when you inevitably lose.

129
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:20,200
I'm done making League of Legends videos.

130
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:27,160
With more and more games introducing competitive laddering systems, more people end up taking the game way too seriously.

131
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:29,480
Look how mad you're getting over a game.

132
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:37,640
In either case, the end result remains the same. The game gets less fun.

133
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:40,120
Calm down, man.

134
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:41,880
It's just a game.

135
00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:43,880
It's not just a game.

136
00:12:44,520 --> 00:12:46,200
That's my life.

137
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:48,440
Since when did video games get so stressful?

138
00:12:48,840 --> 00:12:56,520
It seems like you can't even talk about video games anymore without the whole conversation devolving into a bitter argument about the nature of society.

139
00:12:57,080 --> 00:13:02,220
I miss the days when people would fight over whether the PS3 was better than the Xbox 360.

140
00:13:02,520 --> 00:13:06,440
Nowadays, everything has to be shoehorned into some hackneyed political movement.

141
00:13:06,840 --> 00:13:10,840
Gamer game. And yeah, yeah, I get it. All art is political.

142
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:16,120
It is absolutely vital that we dissect the socioeconomic themes of Shrek's Swamp Cart.

143
00:13:16,520 --> 00:13:21,340
But what you may not realize is that most people play video games as a means of escapism.

144
00:13:22,040 --> 00:13:25,560
Believe it or not, there are people out there in the world who don't have it so good.

145
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:29,880
And video games provide them with a brief reprieve from all of their problems.

146
00:13:30,280 --> 00:13:35,960
So you may have to cut these people a little bit of slack if they don't want to dedicate their only moment of peace to

147
00:13:36,100 --> 00:13:38,100
militant political activism.

148
00:13:38,180 --> 00:13:43,400
However, the past decade has shown us that militant political activism has now become inescapable.

149
00:13:44,020 --> 00:13:51,080
And if you don't use your platform to spread awareness about John C. Calhoun's toenail, then you don't care about the world's problems.

150
00:13:51,540 --> 00:13:53,960
We live in an age of impossible expectations.

151
00:13:54,580 --> 00:14:00,180
Everyone wants the best solution in the least amount of time and anything less than that is considered a failure.

152
00:14:00,740 --> 00:14:07,860
This mindset applies to video games as well and has the debilitating effect of killing games before they even have the chance to succeed.

153
00:14:08,420 --> 00:14:11,300
As soon as the hype train gets behind an upcoming title,

154
00:14:11,460 --> 00:14:16,120
that game is doomed to a monsoon of ridicule if it falls anywhere short of perfection.

155
00:14:16,580 --> 00:14:20,660
Back in the day, there was hardly any information about future game releases.

156
00:14:21,060 --> 00:14:25,780
The first time you'd even know about a new game would be when you spotted it on the store shelves.

157
00:14:26,340 --> 00:14:30,100
Everyone would play the game first then come up with their opinions about it later.

158
00:14:30,580 --> 00:14:37,860
Nowadays, a game gets announced and you have a deluge of YouTubers, streamers, journalists, and forum posters all hyping it up months or even

159
00:14:38,100 --> 00:14:39,380
years before it comes out.

160
00:14:39,940 --> 00:14:46,500
Many people now make up their minds about a game without even playing it, all because their favorite YouTuber said that it sucked.

161
00:14:46,900 --> 00:14:50,260
This can end up truly warping the public's perception of a game.

162
00:14:50,660 --> 00:14:55,620
No Man's Sky was absolutely buried in hate after its lackluster release shattered the hype bubble.

163
00:14:56,100 --> 00:14:59,700
And even though it has slowly but surely rebounded to a solid game,

164
00:15:00,260 --> 00:15:04,040
many players still write it off for failing to meet their initial expectations.

165
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,480
So many new releases end up dead on arrival.

166
00:15:07,880 --> 00:15:15,100
Just look at the disastrous launch of Artifact, a game that was instantaneously hated from the very moment it was revealed.

167
00:15:19,080 --> 00:15:22,280
You can actually pinpoint the second when his heart rips in half.

168
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:25,000
And...

169
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,200
Now!

170
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:30,120
In a vacuum, Artifact is nothing more than an unremarkable card game,

171
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:37,320
but because it was attached to the prestigious Valve lineage of gems, this game was doomed to fail from its very premise.

172
00:15:37,960 --> 00:15:43,400
If Artifact came out from any no-name developer, it could have gone down as a perfectly average game.

173
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:48,700
But when people have the expectation of your company releasing innovative masterpieces,

174
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:51,320
average doesn't cut it.

175
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:54,300
Great expectations make disappointment and inevitability.

176
00:15:54,860 --> 00:16:01,500
This is why many of the most successful games over the past decade were barely promoted until after they were already on the market.

177
00:16:01,980 --> 00:16:07,680
Compare that to a platform like Kickstarter, which has become notorious for churning out disappointment after disappointment.

178
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:13,020
The main issue here isn't necessarily that these projects were mediocre or behind schedule.

179
00:16:13,260 --> 00:16:18,940
The true problem with sites like Kickstarter is that they generate massive hype for products that don't even exist yet.

180
00:16:19,420 --> 00:16:27,340
Is it really justified to feel bamboozled when you agreed to financially back an intangible product because a bunch of people hyped it up on Reddit?

181
00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:31,340
Social media has effectively homogenized everyone's opinions.

182
00:16:31,740 --> 00:16:35,340
Public perception is now inexorably skewed by the circle jerk.

183
00:16:35,820 --> 00:16:41,660
Speaking of circle jerks, the modern era of online communication has also contributed to the rise of the fandom.

184
00:16:42,060 --> 00:16:47,180
This is a topic I discussed in my Rick and Morty video that just as easily applies to video games.

185
00:16:47,580 --> 00:16:52,540
We now occupy an age where otherwise good games can be tarnished by an obnoxious fandom.

186
00:16:53,020 --> 00:16:58,060
The immersive nature of video games can spawn some of the most obsessive fans of any media type.

187
00:16:58,540 --> 00:17:01,420
Fans who worship their favorite game like it's a religion.

188
00:17:01,820 --> 00:17:10,220
It's fans like these who arguably contribute to the deterioration of game design in the industry by continually throwing money at new titles regardless of quality,

189
00:17:10,540 --> 00:17:13,580
thus rewarding companies for predatory business practices.

190
00:17:14,220 --> 00:17:19,920
However, for every mindless fanboy, the internet has created an equal and opposite stubborn contrarian.

191
00:17:20,540 --> 00:17:26,400
The 2010s were unprecedented in the amount of cynicism and disillusionment within the general gaming community.

192
00:17:26,860 --> 00:17:31,760
Contrast this with the 2000s when it seemed like every gamer was giddy with naive optimism.

193
00:17:32,680 --> 00:17:36,940
Technology was progressing before our very eyes and there was so much to be excited about.

194
00:17:37,340 --> 00:17:42,140
Just look at E3, what was once a whimsical wonderland where gamer dreams came true.

195
00:17:42,860 --> 00:17:46,640
These days, E3 is basically treated as a giant cringe compilation.

196
00:17:47,340 --> 00:17:53,740
It seems that as the games themselves have become less fun, gamers have had to seek out entertainment from other sources.

197
00:17:54,780 --> 00:18:00,960
You pop this piece of crap in and what do you get? Well, I'm done making League of Legends videos.

198
00:18:04,060 --> 00:18:12,060
YouTube critics like the angry video game nerd made an entire generation of gamers realize that deriding bad games could be just as fun as enjoying good games.

199
00:18:12,940 --> 00:18:18,460
As it turns out, it's a lot more compelling to watch someone tell you why a game sucks rather than why it's good.

200
00:18:19,100 --> 00:18:23,500
On YouTube, there's a market incentive to ridicule games as much as possible.

201
00:18:23,820 --> 00:18:27,100
Nobody ever makes a video about a game being decently adequate,

202
00:18:27,420 --> 00:18:32,060
but when a game misses the mark, all the biggest commentators come out and blast it.

203
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:35,580
Nowadays, everyone is aware of the circus that is Yandere Sim,

204
00:18:35,740 --> 00:18:40,460
but how many of us can actually name a single other game in the genre? I know I can't.

205
00:18:40,860 --> 00:18:44,380
I've never played a single anime related game in my entire life,

206
00:18:44,700 --> 00:18:51,520
and yet my whole perception of the genre is negative because of a single eccentric story that's been blown up by YouTube commentators.

207
00:18:52,140 --> 00:19:00,060
Online discourse puts the negativity bias on steroids, and it has without a doubt contributed to the prevailing cynicism of the past decade.

208
00:19:00,540 --> 00:19:07,280
Sometimes it feels like people these days are actively rooting for games to fail so they can participate in the festival of mockery.

209
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:11,280
Twenty years ago when a game flopped, nobody really cared that much.

210
00:19:11,680 --> 00:19:16,960
But when studios release a bad game now, they get absolutely hammered for months on end.

211
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:21,120
So with that in mind, if you're a game studio planning your next release,

212
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:26,420
why would you even want to risk provoking the online mob by attempting anything new or innovative?

213
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:30,480
The best course of action is to just play it safe by releasing bland,

214
00:19:30,700 --> 00:19:34,720
formulaic crowd pleasers that most people will forget about before the end of the year.

215
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:40,900
At least then you avoid a flaming PR disaster, even if it does induce a perpetual state of mediocrity.

216
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:48,240
What makes this even worse is how relentlessly nitpicking games is now being treated as some kind of cool personality trait.

217
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:54,720
It seems like no matter what game you play these days, you'll encounter some jaded contrarian calling you dumb for liking it.

218
00:19:55,120 --> 00:20:02,880
This elitist gatekeeping was nowhere near as prevalent in the past, as back then, nobody really cared what video games you played for fun.

219
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:06,820
Now they're treated as an indictment against your entire personality.

220
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:10,720
At least that's how it feels when you enter any comment section on the web.

221
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:18,960
The last decade has seen gamers become irrevocably polarized, so much so that it's impossible to tell what they really want anymore.

222
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:24,240
For so many years, gamers had this myopic obsession with graphics and realism,

223
00:20:24,560 --> 00:20:29,280
to such an extent that they would weigh graphical fidelity higher than any other design aspect.

224
00:20:29,680 --> 00:20:34,960
And now every game has amazing graphics, yet seem to be lacking in all other areas of design.

225
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:39,520
Graphics are better than ever before, while gamers have never been more miserable.

226
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:46,960
If it's not fun, why bother? Turns out that gamers, much like any other consumer base, don't really know what they want.

227
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:53,120
And now that most of us have been thoroughly put off by the uncanny valley mannequins of modern-day games,

228
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:58,180
we've actually seen studios moving back to the low poly cartoony aesthetics of the 2000s.

229
00:20:59,060 --> 00:21:04,740
Gamers will complain about a franchise like Pokemon failing to innovate and releasing the same game over and over,

230
00:21:05,220 --> 00:21:11,540
even though across practically all genres, sequels, remakes, and remasters continue to sell consistently well.

231
00:21:11,940 --> 00:21:17,540
And I don't exactly see everyone rushing out to go buy the most experimental avant-garde titles at all times.

232
00:21:18,020 --> 00:21:20,980
So you want a realistic down-to-earth game

233
00:21:21,700 --> 00:21:24,980
that's completely off the wall and swarming with magic robots.

234
00:21:25,300 --> 00:21:30,740
Ultimately, if you have a formula that works and makes money, why would you have any reason to change it?

235
00:21:31,220 --> 00:21:34,820
Similarly, if you already have a library of games you enjoy playing,

236
00:21:35,140 --> 00:21:38,660
why would you go out and buy a new one that you probably won't even like?

237
00:21:39,140 --> 00:21:43,960
And that brings me to my final point about why modern games just don't feel as fun to play.

238
00:21:48,900 --> 00:21:53,860
There is so much gaming content today that simply didn't exist 20 years ago.

239
00:21:54,180 --> 00:22:01,460
People these days will spend hours playing a game, then hours watching YouTubers review games, then hours watching Twitch streamers play games.

240
00:22:02,100 --> 00:22:08,820
None of these things are particularly bad on their own, but combined they can burn people out on new games faster than ever before.

241
00:22:09,300 --> 00:22:11,480
After a while it all becomes a bit exhausting.

242
00:22:12,100 --> 00:22:17,300
The market is so saturated with gaming related content that it's hard for anything to stand out.

243
00:22:17,300 --> 00:22:26,180
At some point it's difficult to justify spending time caring about any new games because so many good ones already exist.

244
00:22:26,660 --> 00:22:31,220
The sad truth is that most of us just can't get that excited about new games anymore.

245
00:22:33,620 --> 00:22:38,580
In the 2000s we got to see major strides in technological progress year after year.

246
00:22:39,140 --> 00:22:45,300
Stuff we take for granted today like online play and HD graphics used to be mind-blowing achievements back in the day.

247
00:22:45,860 --> 00:22:53,140
But now that the current paradigm has fulfilled most of its potential, innovation as of late has felt much more marginal in its progress.

248
00:22:53,780 --> 00:22:58,260
Once something becomes advanced enough you can only do so much to improve it further.

249
00:22:58,660 --> 00:23:02,900
The differences between a PS1 game and a PS2 game are immediately clear.

250
00:23:03,300 --> 00:23:09,300
But are PS3 games really that far off from PS4 games? In terms of specific game design,

251
00:23:09,300 --> 00:23:12,580
many of the most compelling gameplay concepts have already been done.

252
00:23:12,980 --> 00:23:19,060
I mean for the past five years the most popular games have all been different spin-offs of the battle royale game type.

253
00:23:19,540 --> 00:23:25,780
Overwatch is just TF2 mixed with League of Legends. Valorant is just Counter-Strike mixed with Overwatch.

254
00:23:26,340 --> 00:23:31,300
Pretty much any new game that comes out today is directly comparable to something that already exists.

255
00:23:31,940 --> 00:23:39,460
It's for this reason that the 2010s have seen an unprecedented trend in players preferring to stick with older titles like TF2 and Melee.

256
00:23:39,860 --> 00:23:44,680
These games feel like the ideal versions of what their successors have attempted to replicate.

257
00:23:45,220 --> 00:23:52,180
Older games are also much more likely to have active modding communities who only seek to further perfect these already great titles.

258
00:23:52,660 --> 00:23:57,080
Modders can often perform amazing feats with no budget deadlines or expectations.

259
00:23:57,780 --> 00:24:05,140
Melee's community-created netplay is a free service that functions better than Nintendo's own dedicated servers for Smash Ultimate.

260
00:24:05,540 --> 00:24:10,180
Which, by the way, you have to pay for. If you had to pick between these two options,

261
00:24:10,260 --> 00:24:16,100
which would you honestly choose? And with all that being said, have video games been on a downward spiral?

262
00:24:16,660 --> 00:24:21,620
I'm not going to sit here and tell you the answer because just like any video game out there, it's subjective.

263
00:24:22,980 --> 00:24:24,980
But if you want my opinion on the matter,

264
00:24:24,980 --> 00:24:30,420
I don't actually believe that things are as gloomy as the majority of internet commentators would have you believe.

265
00:24:30,980 --> 00:24:35,780
Not every game is going to be a masterpiece. That's what makes each masterpiece so special.

266
00:24:36,260 --> 00:24:38,740
It's important to understand where games go wrong,

267
00:24:38,820 --> 00:24:44,840
but we should also give credit where credit is due and not discard an entire body of work for minor infractions.

268
00:24:45,460 --> 00:24:49,380
Our favorite franchises from the 2000s may have fallen on hard times,

269
00:24:49,620 --> 00:24:54,420
but just like in every other decade, new ones will inevitably rise up to take their place.

270
00:24:55,060 --> 00:24:58,100
I feel like gaming is in a highly transitional state right now.

271
00:24:58,820 --> 00:25:05,620
Much like when video games transition from arcades to home consoles, there's a lot of chaos and uncertainty in the industry.

272
00:25:06,260 --> 00:25:11,080
So is the whole business just doomed to crash and burn and bury itself in the New Mexico desert?

273
00:25:11,620 --> 00:25:16,580
Most likely not, because as much as gamers like to complain and ridicule the games they play,

274
00:25:17,140 --> 00:25:19,540
we all know they're just going to buy the next one anyway.

275
00:25:20,020 --> 00:25:26,820
Even though it may seem like everyone hates games these days, people wouldn't get so frustrated if they didn't love games deep down.

276
00:25:26,820 --> 00:25:33,780
At the end of the day, everyone's just trying to recapture that feeling of total immersion in a virtual world,

277
00:25:34,260 --> 00:25:38,980
or at least any feeling besides the jaded, disgruntled cynicism of the real world.

278
00:25:39,460 --> 00:25:44,500
Not every game will help you accomplish this, so consider yourself lucky when you find one that does.

279
00:25:45,140 --> 00:25:50,020
Anyway, in conclusion, Pokémon GO was the most fun I had in any game from the past decade,

280
00:25:50,340 --> 00:25:53,800
and I rate NASCAR Thunder 04 an 8 out of 10.

281
00:25:56,820 --> 00:26:07,940
Bold, brazen, audacious, unapologetically defiant, these are the words I found in my thesaurus,

282
00:26:07,940 --> 00:26:14,100
which are necessary to describe the new Emperor Lemon Downward Spiral Signature Collection.

283
00:26:14,100 --> 00:26:20,580
Two years ago, Teespring unceremoniously removed my original design for trademark infringement.

284
00:26:20,580 --> 00:26:25,860
Well, guess what, you bunch of idiots? How about I remove myself from your entire website

285
00:26:25,860 --> 00:26:28,660
and start selling my stuff anywhere else?

286
00:26:28,660 --> 00:26:33,300
Emp was seriously pissed off, and for a moment there I thought there was going to be an incident,

287
00:26:33,300 --> 00:26:35,060
but luckily that didn't happen.

288
00:26:35,060 --> 00:26:39,380
Oh, you want to talk about trademark infringement? I'll show you trademark infringement.

289
00:26:39,380 --> 00:26:42,580
I'll give them the greatest trademark infringement anyone's ever seen.

290
00:26:42,580 --> 00:26:46,340
You know, these designs are quite similar to the ones they have at Doh! No!

291
00:26:46,340 --> 00:26:49,700
Battented Downward Spiral. Old family recipe.

292
00:26:49,700 --> 00:26:55,940
The new, totally not trademark infringement collection is now available at crowdmade.com

293
00:26:55,940 --> 00:27:02,340
