00:00.000 --> 00:05.700
Earlier this summer, I picked up NASCAR Thunder 2004 from a local flea market for seven dollars.

00:05.860 --> 00:11.760
This game is regarded by NASCAR fans as the best NASCAR console release of all time.

00:11.880 --> 00:15.800
A game that has not been topped more than 17 years after its release.

00:16.120 --> 00:22.480
When I played it, I was astounded at the amount of content and gameplay variety available in a 2003 game.

00:23.240 --> 00:25.480
Naturally, as we evaluate older media,

00:25.480 --> 00:30.200
you have to excuse a certain level of crappiness due to the technical limitations of the era.

00:30.520 --> 00:37.080
For example, a movie from 1982 is going to have significantly worse special effects than a movie in the present day,

00:37.240 --> 00:41.160
so it's not really fair to judge older works along modern standards.

00:41.400 --> 00:48.040
But just as we can forgive old media for their limitations, should we punish new media for a lack of progression?

00:49.160 --> 00:53.360
Imagine taking a time machine back to 2003 and telling NASCAR fans,

00:53.520 --> 00:59.280
this game right here, this is as good as it's gonna get. It's all downhill from here.

00:59.440 --> 01:04.520
They would have thought that an asteroid must have wiped out the human civilization in 2004,

01:04.760 --> 01:09.520
because how could it be possible that despite the exponential growth in processing power,

01:09.520 --> 01:12.880
and with the video game industry earning record revenue,

01:13.000 --> 01:18.200
not a single company has managed to make a better game nearly two decades into the future.

01:18.200 --> 01:22.960
I feel like NASCAR Thunder represents a disturbing trend in video games as a whole.

01:23.440 --> 01:27.440
In general, the last decade of games has been profoundly disappointing.

01:27.760 --> 01:31.200
I want to clarify here that this is not my individual opinion,

01:31.440 --> 01:35.840
rather the general consensus that I've perceived from the gaming community at large.

01:36.400 --> 01:39.600
I feel like everyone entered the 2010s with such optimism.

01:40.080 --> 01:47.440
So many of us were eagerly anticipating how the next-gen technology was going to completely transform the way we experienced our favorite games.

01:47.440 --> 01:53.280
Half-Life, Fallout, Halo, Call of Duty, Mass Effect, World of Warcraft, Madden.

01:53.280 --> 01:57.120
These franchises brought us some of the greatest games of the 2000s.

01:57.280 --> 02:01.680
Little did we know just how hard all of these beloved series would fall off a cliff.

02:01.680 --> 02:07.680
I polled my audience on Twitter what they would prefer if they could only play games from one of these decades,

02:08.320 --> 02:12.160
and remarkably, 45% of respondents chose the 2000s.

02:12.720 --> 02:20.400
This means that nearly half of all people would be willing to give up the entire 8th generation of consoles and a significant portion of the 7th gen.

02:20.880 --> 02:27.360
They would be willing to give up better graphics, better performance, most online multiplayer games, most of the games on Steam,

02:27.680 --> 02:34.000
most games on the App Store or Google Play, the most popular indie games, seamless DLC and patches,

02:34.320 --> 02:41.200
cloud storage, fully integrated competitive lobbying, VR, Xbox Kinect, Raid Shadow Legends.

02:41.680 --> 02:46.080
They would be willing to give up all of this to go play Wii Sports and Club Penguin.

02:46.400 --> 02:52.480
Despite all of our next-gen technology, many people feel that the games today simply aren't as good.

02:52.960 --> 02:56.160
So with that being said, what happened to video games?

02:56.800 --> 03:01.600
The first and most obvious reason for this is the deterioration of game design.

03:02.080 --> 03:06.400
15 years ago, you'd go to the store, purchase the game and own the finished product.

03:06.960 --> 03:12.560
Then, somewhere along the way, companies figured out how to make players purchase the same game multiple times.

03:13.340 --> 03:22.080
Nowadays, game studios have become all too comfortable rushing out broken, unfinished products and just patching in the rest of the content in the years after release.

03:22.640 --> 03:29.920
Couple that with charging for DLC, microtransactions and pay-to-win mechanics, and consumers end up spending more for less.

03:30.560 --> 03:34.400
This issue has been discussed to death here on YouTube because it's inherently

03:34.780 --> 03:40.800
unsatisfying to pay full price for a game and not have it resemble a finished product until long after you've stopped caring.

03:41.120 --> 03:47.300
This is a trend that's undoubtedly emerged over the past decade because if you released a broken game in the 2000s,

03:47.920 --> 03:55.120
people just wouldn't buy it. But even worse than releasing broken games is releasing broken games with no intent on fixing them.

03:55.600 --> 03:59.140
This has been a disastrous consequence of licensing at exclusivity.

03:59.920 --> 04:04.400
And no other developer symbolizes this problem more than EA Sports.

04:05.120 --> 04:12.900
Some of you today may find this hard to believe, but there was once a time when EA made great sports games like NASCAR Thunder 2004.

04:13.520 --> 04:19.680
However, in just five years, EA went from releasing the best NASCAR console game of all time to one of the most

04:19.900 --> 04:28.100
universally hated games in the genre. What happened? Well, starting in 2003, EA bought out the exclusive rights to the NASCAR license.

04:28.420 --> 04:34.900
Prior to that, you had the NASCAR Heat and NASCAR Racing franchises all producing quality games alongside EA.

04:35.060 --> 04:41.060
The competition forced these developers to release great products. After EA bought out the license,

04:41.060 --> 04:47.460
they no longer had any incentive to outdo their competition, and the series slowly but surely deteriorated.

04:47.900 --> 04:55.500
A similar outcome happened to the Madden and FIFA franchises, with the only difference being that EA is still holding them hostage to this day.

04:55.900 --> 05:03.660
Couple that with 2K's recent string of duds, and we have entered a disturbing reality where there are practically no good sports games on the market.

05:04.140 --> 05:10.540
These games used to be an integral part of every console generation, and now they just seem to exist to fill shelf space.

05:12.220 --> 05:20.220
And due to the monopolistic nature of these licensing deals, it's unlikely that this trend will change anytime soon.

05:20.780 --> 05:26.540
Players will just keep buying the same mediocre game every year because if you want the newest game from your favorite sport,

05:26.860 --> 05:28.860
there are literally no other options.

05:29.500 --> 05:35.660
Even without exclusive licenses, the overall selection of games over the past decade has felt rather limited.

05:35.980 --> 05:38.860
It's a phenomenon I call the death of the simple game.

05:39.340 --> 05:44.700
When I was a kid, I spent dozens of hours playing games like ATV 2, Midnight Club 3, Burnout 3.

05:45.020 --> 05:47.900
These were all what I consider simple, good games.

05:48.440 --> 05:55.340
Solid, fun titles that didn't necessarily set the world on fire with innovation, but were still nice to have in your library.

05:55.820 --> 06:01.020
These were games that you could pick up and play for a couple of weeks and eventually revisit once a year or so.

06:01.960 --> 06:10.140
Unfortunately, pretty much all these franchises died with a decade, and the 2010s were left with what felt like a huge void in good middle tier games.

06:10.700 --> 06:14.540
It seems like most games these days are created to fit one of two extremes.

06:14.940 --> 06:22.300
Either a crappy phone game you can play on the toilet, or a grandiose open world multiplayer battle royale with a 40-hour

06:22.520 --> 06:24.640
cinematic story and epic cutscenes.

06:25.100 --> 06:31.680
I believe the shift towards the latter can be attributed to by far the most successful game of the 2010s, Minecraft.

06:34.540 --> 06:40.300
The meteoric rise of Minecraft led to a cataclysmic shift in what players expected out of a video game.

06:40.860 --> 06:44.380
The amount of unique gameplay possibilities was virtually unlimited,

06:44.860 --> 06:50.620
and it was not uncommon for players to dedicate hundreds, if not thousands of hours to this single game.

06:51.260 --> 06:56.060
The same is true for Minecraft's less respected, but equally popular cousin, Roblox.

06:56.760 --> 07:01.360
Previously, games like RuneScape and World of Warcraft would draw similar levels of dedication,

07:01.820 --> 07:08.220
but they didn't come close to the immense mainstream popularity that Minecraft and Roblox continued to hold to this day.

07:09.020 --> 07:15.840
All of the time spent on these two games is time that would have been shared among dozens of those smaller, simple games from the 2000s.

07:17.000 --> 07:21.340
Unfortunately, this has made it difficult for studios to justify creating simple games,

07:21.820 --> 07:28.300
because why would someone pay for a new game when they can just stick to the unlimited gameplay variety in a game they already own?

07:28.700 --> 07:33.760
This all but forces modern publishers to release lazy free-to-play games riddled with microtransactions,

07:34.720 --> 07:41.920
or haphazardly shove in as many bells and whistles as possible to create what is more often than not a disappointing and incoherent mess.

07:42.240 --> 07:45.760
It's so dense. Every single image has so many things going on.

07:47.840 --> 07:54.820
Another far-reaching consequence of Minecraft and Roblox is that they have forced every other game to prioritize online multiplayer,

07:55.360 --> 07:58.260
which has, in turn, killed off local multiplayer.

07:59.040 --> 08:03.680
Some of the most fun I had as a kid was playing Nintendo DS games on the bus before school.

08:04.240 --> 08:08.980
The DS let you wirelessly connect to local multiplayer rooms without an internet connection,

08:09.440 --> 08:14.000
and the best part was you could play games like Mario Kart without even owning the game yourself.

08:14.640 --> 08:20.800
In my opinion, this was the peak of not just local multiplayer gaming, but handheld gaming, yet another genre

08:20.800 --> 08:26.000
I used to really like that has gradually deteriorated over the past decade. Now don't get me wrong,

08:26.080 --> 08:28.080
I don't hate online multiplayer.

08:28.400 --> 08:33.860
My most played game of all time is Team Fortress 2, which is a strictly online multiplayer experience.

08:37.680 --> 08:45.280
However, I'll be the first to admit that playing against random strangers online is simply not as fulfilling as playing alongside your friends and family

08:45.360 --> 08:47.120
whom you see every day.

08:47.120 --> 08:52.980
This has always been an essential part of what makes video games fun, going all the way back to the days of arcades.

08:53.460 --> 08:59.780
To be perfectly honest, the ability to play with anybody from around the world will always be impressive on a technical level,

09:00.100 --> 09:05.620
but the experience doesn't compare to the simple pleasures of just going to a friend's house to play Guitar Hero.

09:06.100 --> 09:09.640
The harsh reality of online multiplayer is that it's very impersonal.

09:10.480 --> 09:14.740
Ironically, despite having the potential to connect us with an infinite number of people,

09:15.060 --> 09:18.680
online multiplayer has left us feeling more isolated than ever before.

09:19.380 --> 09:22.680
Most of the time, it just feels like you're playing against very good CPUs.

09:22.980 --> 09:26.420
Except they can trash talk you and call you bad for making a single mistake.

09:26.980 --> 09:29.300
With friends, it's all just casual banter,

09:29.300 --> 09:34.920
but with strangers, getting constantly flamed can turn a fun game into an incredibly frustrating experience.

09:35.380 --> 09:40.680
Because of this, it's not surprising why online multiplayer games tend to carry the most toxic communities.

09:41.220 --> 09:45.380
And as more studios shift away from local multiplayer in favor of online play,

09:45.700 --> 09:48.980
it's no wonder why games are starting to feel less fun in general.

09:49.460 --> 09:56.180
Speaking of which, the past decade has led to a significant portion of people who no longer engage with games for fun.

09:56.820 --> 10:02.120
In many aspects, video games have become serious business, both literally and figuratively.

10:02.820 --> 10:06.820
In a literal sense, the business of video games is seriously booming.

10:07.360 --> 10:11.220
Recently, the gaming industry has become really good at making money,

10:11.540 --> 10:17.140
and the money-making process has made things less fun for consumers and really not fun for developers.

10:17.700 --> 10:21.860
The ever-increasing thirst for profit has corporatized the business at large.

10:22.340 --> 10:27.460
Gone are the days of scrappy, passionate developers working to make their games the best that they can be.

10:28.100 --> 10:34.980
Modern-day devs toil feverishly to meet impossible deadlines and end up creating products that both they and their audience hate.

10:35.540 --> 10:40.500
Back in the day, this practice would manifest itself in the form of tacky, licensed shovelware,

10:40.900 --> 10:43.220
but some of these games ended up being pretty good.

10:43.780 --> 10:49.780
At least shovelware was far easier to avoid than the predatory business models currently infesting games today.

10:50.340 --> 10:57.240
Modern-day games are designed to be more addictive than fun and will not hesitate to take more of the player's money at every opportunity.

10:57.860 --> 11:02.020
For today's game companies, the only high score they care about is their profit margin.

11:02.500 --> 11:05.780
It doesn't matter if games are good as long as they produce revenue.

11:06.260 --> 11:10.180
However, the business of video games now extends far beyond the publishers.

11:10.660 --> 11:17.140
Players can now go into business for themselves by making money from playing games on Twitch, YouTube, or as an esports competitor.

11:26.980 --> 11:30.980
Ladies and gentlemen, the dream of every kid growing up in the 2000s is real.

11:31.380 --> 11:34.360
But just like everything else, it wasn't at all what we expected.

11:34.840 --> 11:41.400
As it turns out, playing games out of obligation rather than leisure is a great way to suck all the enjoyment out of whatever you're playing.

11:42.040 --> 11:49.560
This leads to highly uncomfortable situations where people like Wings of Redemption force themselves to be publicly humiliated on a regular basis

11:49.640 --> 11:53.000
in a game they hate because it's the only way to pay his bills.

11:53.400 --> 11:56.280
I'm already playing a game I don't want to play to get views.

12:00.440 --> 12:02.680
I really wish I weren't here right now.

12:03.000 --> 12:09.480
As for competitive play, there's no shortage of people who completely burn themselves out trying to grind out an extra dozen elo points.

12:09.960 --> 12:15.480
When winning is the only thing that matters, the experience starts to quickly unravel when you inevitably lose.

12:15.480 --> 12:20.200
I'm done making League of Legends videos.

12:20.600 --> 12:27.160
With more and more games introducing competitive laddering systems, more people end up taking the game way too seriously.

12:27.480 --> 12:29.480
Look how mad you're getting over a game.

12:33.240 --> 12:37.640
In either case, the end result remains the same. The game gets less fun.

12:38.200 --> 12:40.120
Calm down, man.

12:40.120 --> 12:41.880
It's just a game.

12:41.880 --> 12:43.880
It's not just a game.

12:44.520 --> 12:46.200
That's my life.

12:46.200 --> 12:48.440
Since when did video games get so stressful?

12:48.840 --> 12:56.520
It seems like you can't even talk about video games anymore without the whole conversation devolving into a bitter argument about the nature of society.

12:57.080 --> 13:02.220
I miss the days when people would fight over whether the PS3 was better than the Xbox 360.

13:02.520 --> 13:06.440
Nowadays, everything has to be shoehorned into some hackneyed political movement.

13:06.840 --> 13:10.840
Gamer game. And yeah, yeah, I get it. All art is political.

13:11.080 --> 13:16.120
It is absolutely vital that we dissect the socioeconomic themes of Shrek's Swamp Cart.

13:16.520 --> 13:21.340
But what you may not realize is that most people play video games as a means of escapism.

13:22.040 --> 13:25.560
Believe it or not, there are people out there in the world who don't have it so good.

13:25.720 --> 13:29.880
And video games provide them with a brief reprieve from all of their problems.

13:30.280 --> 13:35.960
So you may have to cut these people a little bit of slack if they don't want to dedicate their only moment of peace to

13:36.100 --> 13:38.100
militant political activism.

13:38.180 --> 13:43.400
However, the past decade has shown us that militant political activism has now become inescapable.

13:44.020 --> 13:51.080
And if you don't use your platform to spread awareness about John C. Calhoun's toenail, then you don't care about the world's problems.

13:51.540 --> 13:53.960
We live in an age of impossible expectations.

13:54.580 --> 14:00.180
Everyone wants the best solution in the least amount of time and anything less than that is considered a failure.

14:00.740 --> 14:07.860
This mindset applies to video games as well and has the debilitating effect of killing games before they even have the chance to succeed.

14:08.420 --> 14:11.300
As soon as the hype train gets behind an upcoming title,

14:11.460 --> 14:16.120
that game is doomed to a monsoon of ridicule if it falls anywhere short of perfection.

14:16.580 --> 14:20.660
Back in the day, there was hardly any information about future game releases.

14:21.060 --> 14:25.780
The first time you'd even know about a new game would be when you spotted it on the store shelves.

14:26.340 --> 14:30.100
Everyone would play the game first then come up with their opinions about it later.

14:30.580 --> 14:37.860
Nowadays, a game gets announced and you have a deluge of YouTubers, streamers, journalists, and forum posters all hyping it up months or even

14:38.100 --> 14:39.380
years before it comes out.

14:39.940 --> 14:46.500
Many people now make up their minds about a game without even playing it, all because their favorite YouTuber said that it sucked.

14:46.900 --> 14:50.260
This can end up truly warping the public's perception of a game.

14:50.660 --> 14:55.620
No Man's Sky was absolutely buried in hate after its lackluster release shattered the hype bubble.

14:56.100 --> 14:59.700
And even though it has slowly but surely rebounded to a solid game,

15:00.260 --> 15:04.040
many players still write it off for failing to meet their initial expectations.

15:05.000 --> 15:07.480
So many new releases end up dead on arrival.

15:07.880 --> 15:15.100
Just look at the disastrous launch of Artifact, a game that was instantaneously hated from the very moment it was revealed.

15:19.080 --> 15:22.280
You can actually pinpoint the second when his heart rips in half.

15:23.400 --> 15:25.000
And...

15:25.000 --> 15:26.200
Now!

15:26.200 --> 15:30.120
In a vacuum, Artifact is nothing more than an unremarkable card game,

15:30.360 --> 15:37.320
but because it was attached to the prestigious Valve lineage of gems, this game was doomed to fail from its very premise.

15:37.960 --> 15:43.400
If Artifact came out from any no-name developer, it could have gone down as a perfectly average game.

15:43.800 --> 15:48.700
But when people have the expectation of your company releasing innovative masterpieces,

15:49.320 --> 15:51.320
average doesn't cut it.

15:51.320 --> 15:54.300
Great expectations make disappointment and inevitability.

15:54.860 --> 16:01.500
This is why many of the most successful games over the past decade were barely promoted until after they were already on the market.

16:01.980 --> 16:07.680
Compare that to a platform like Kickstarter, which has become notorious for churning out disappointment after disappointment.

16:08.300 --> 16:13.020
The main issue here isn't necessarily that these projects were mediocre or behind schedule.

16:13.260 --> 16:18.940
The true problem with sites like Kickstarter is that they generate massive hype for products that don't even exist yet.

16:19.420 --> 16:27.340
Is it really justified to feel bamboozled when you agreed to financially back an intangible product because a bunch of people hyped it up on Reddit?

16:27.820 --> 16:31.340
Social media has effectively homogenized everyone's opinions.

16:31.740 --> 16:35.340
Public perception is now inexorably skewed by the circle jerk.

16:35.820 --> 16:41.660
Speaking of circle jerks, the modern era of online communication has also contributed to the rise of the fandom.

16:42.060 --> 16:47.180
This is a topic I discussed in my Rick and Morty video that just as easily applies to video games.

16:47.580 --> 16:52.540
We now occupy an age where otherwise good games can be tarnished by an obnoxious fandom.

16:53.020 --> 16:58.060
The immersive nature of video games can spawn some of the most obsessive fans of any media type.

16:58.540 --> 17:01.420
Fans who worship their favorite game like it's a religion.

17:01.820 --> 17:10.220
It's fans like these who arguably contribute to the deterioration of game design in the industry by continually throwing money at new titles regardless of quality,

17:10.540 --> 17:13.580
thus rewarding companies for predatory business practices.

17:14.220 --> 17:19.920
However, for every mindless fanboy, the internet has created an equal and opposite stubborn contrarian.

17:20.540 --> 17:26.400
The 2010s were unprecedented in the amount of cynicism and disillusionment within the general gaming community.

17:26.860 --> 17:31.760
Contrast this with the 2000s when it seemed like every gamer was giddy with naive optimism.

17:32.680 --> 17:36.940
Technology was progressing before our very eyes and there was so much to be excited about.

17:37.340 --> 17:42.140
Just look at E3, what was once a whimsical wonderland where gamer dreams came true.

17:42.860 --> 17:46.640
These days, E3 is basically treated as a giant cringe compilation.

17:47.340 --> 17:53.740
It seems that as the games themselves have become less fun, gamers have had to seek out entertainment from other sources.

17:54.780 --> 18:00.960
You pop this piece of crap in and what do you get? Well, I'm done making League of Legends videos.

18:04.060 --> 18:12.060
YouTube critics like the angry video game nerd made an entire generation of gamers realize that deriding bad games could be just as fun as enjoying good games.

18:12.940 --> 18:18.460
As it turns out, it's a lot more compelling to watch someone tell you why a game sucks rather than why it's good.

18:19.100 --> 18:23.500
On YouTube, there's a market incentive to ridicule games as much as possible.

18:23.820 --> 18:27.100
Nobody ever makes a video about a game being decently adequate,

18:27.420 --> 18:32.060
but when a game misses the mark, all the biggest commentators come out and blast it.

18:32.440 --> 18:35.580
Nowadays, everyone is aware of the circus that is Yandere Sim,

18:35.740 --> 18:40.460
but how many of us can actually name a single other game in the genre? I know I can't.

18:40.860 --> 18:44.380
I've never played a single anime related game in my entire life,

18:44.700 --> 18:51.520
and yet my whole perception of the genre is negative because of a single eccentric story that's been blown up by YouTube commentators.

18:52.140 --> 19:00.060
Online discourse puts the negativity bias on steroids, and it has without a doubt contributed to the prevailing cynicism of the past decade.

19:00.540 --> 19:07.280
Sometimes it feels like people these days are actively rooting for games to fail so they can participate in the festival of mockery.

19:07.680 --> 19:11.280
Twenty years ago when a game flopped, nobody really cared that much.

19:11.680 --> 19:16.960
But when studios release a bad game now, they get absolutely hammered for months on end.

19:17.440 --> 19:21.120
So with that in mind, if you're a game studio planning your next release,

19:21.440 --> 19:26.420
why would you even want to risk provoking the online mob by attempting anything new or innovative?

19:26.720 --> 19:30.480
The best course of action is to just play it safe by releasing bland,

19:30.700 --> 19:34.720
formulaic crowd pleasers that most people will forget about before the end of the year.

19:35.120 --> 19:40.900
At least then you avoid a flaming PR disaster, even if it does induce a perpetual state of mediocrity.

19:41.680 --> 19:48.240
What makes this even worse is how relentlessly nitpicking games is now being treated as some kind of cool personality trait.

19:48.800 --> 19:54.720
It seems like no matter what game you play these days, you'll encounter some jaded contrarian calling you dumb for liking it.

19:55.120 --> 20:02.880
This elitist gatekeeping was nowhere near as prevalent in the past, as back then, nobody really cared what video games you played for fun.

20:03.520 --> 20:06.820
Now they're treated as an indictment against your entire personality.

20:07.440 --> 20:10.720
At least that's how it feels when you enter any comment section on the web.

20:11.200 --> 20:18.960
The last decade has seen gamers become irrevocably polarized, so much so that it's impossible to tell what they really want anymore.

20:19.520 --> 20:24.240
For so many years, gamers had this myopic obsession with graphics and realism,

20:24.560 --> 20:29.280
to such an extent that they would weigh graphical fidelity higher than any other design aspect.

20:29.680 --> 20:34.960
And now every game has amazing graphics, yet seem to be lacking in all other areas of design.

20:35.440 --> 20:39.520
Graphics are better than ever before, while gamers have never been more miserable.

20:40.000 --> 20:46.960
If it's not fun, why bother? Turns out that gamers, much like any other consumer base, don't really know what they want.

20:47.440 --> 20:53.120
And now that most of us have been thoroughly put off by the uncanny valley mannequins of modern-day games,

20:53.440 --> 20:58.180
we've actually seen studios moving back to the low poly cartoony aesthetics of the 2000s.

20:59.060 --> 21:04.740
Gamers will complain about a franchise like Pokemon failing to innovate and releasing the same game over and over,

21:05.220 --> 21:11.540
even though across practically all genres, sequels, remakes, and remasters continue to sell consistently well.

21:11.940 --> 21:17.540
And I don't exactly see everyone rushing out to go buy the most experimental avant-garde titles at all times.

21:18.020 --> 21:20.980
So you want a realistic down-to-earth game

21:21.700 --> 21:24.980
that's completely off the wall and swarming with magic robots.

21:25.300 --> 21:30.740
Ultimately, if you have a formula that works and makes money, why would you have any reason to change it?

21:31.220 --> 21:34.820
Similarly, if you already have a library of games you enjoy playing,

21:35.140 --> 21:38.660
why would you go out and buy a new one that you probably won't even like?

21:39.140 --> 21:43.960
And that brings me to my final point about why modern games just don't feel as fun to play.

21:48.900 --> 21:53.860
There is so much gaming content today that simply didn't exist 20 years ago.

21:54.180 --> 22:01.460
People these days will spend hours playing a game, then hours watching YouTubers review games, then hours watching Twitch streamers play games.

22:02.100 --> 22:08.820
None of these things are particularly bad on their own, but combined they can burn people out on new games faster than ever before.

22:09.300 --> 22:11.480
After a while it all becomes a bit exhausting.

22:12.100 --> 22:17.300
The market is so saturated with gaming related content that it's hard for anything to stand out.

22:17.300 --> 22:26.180
At some point it's difficult to justify spending time caring about any new games because so many good ones already exist.

22:26.660 --> 22:31.220
The sad truth is that most of us just can't get that excited about new games anymore.

22:33.620 --> 22:38.580
In the 2000s we got to see major strides in technological progress year after year.

22:39.140 --> 22:45.300
Stuff we take for granted today like online play and HD graphics used to be mind-blowing achievements back in the day.

22:45.860 --> 22:53.140
But now that the current paradigm has fulfilled most of its potential, innovation as of late has felt much more marginal in its progress.

22:53.780 --> 22:58.260
Once something becomes advanced enough you can only do so much to improve it further.

22:58.660 --> 23:02.900
The differences between a PS1 game and a PS2 game are immediately clear.

23:03.300 --> 23:09.300
But are PS3 games really that far off from PS4 games? In terms of specific game design,

23:09.300 --> 23:12.580
many of the most compelling gameplay concepts have already been done.

23:12.980 --> 23:19.060
I mean for the past five years the most popular games have all been different spin-offs of the battle royale game type.

23:19.540 --> 23:25.780
Overwatch is just TF2 mixed with League of Legends. Valorant is just Counter-Strike mixed with Overwatch.

23:26.340 --> 23:31.300
Pretty much any new game that comes out today is directly comparable to something that already exists.

23:31.940 --> 23:39.460
It's for this reason that the 2010s have seen an unprecedented trend in players preferring to stick with older titles like TF2 and Melee.

23:39.860 --> 23:44.680
These games feel like the ideal versions of what their successors have attempted to replicate.

23:45.220 --> 23:52.180
Older games are also much more likely to have active modding communities who only seek to further perfect these already great titles.

23:52.660 --> 23:57.080
Modders can often perform amazing feats with no budget deadlines or expectations.

23:57.780 --> 24:05.140
Melee's community-created netplay is a free service that functions better than Nintendo's own dedicated servers for Smash Ultimate.

24:05.540 --> 24:10.180
Which, by the way, you have to pay for. If you had to pick between these two options,

24:10.260 --> 24:16.100
which would you honestly choose? And with all that being said, have video games been on a downward spiral?

24:16.660 --> 24:21.620
I'm not going to sit here and tell you the answer because just like any video game out there, it's subjective.

24:22.980 --> 24:24.980
But if you want my opinion on the matter,

24:24.980 --> 24:30.420
I don't actually believe that things are as gloomy as the majority of internet commentators would have you believe.

24:30.980 --> 24:35.780
Not every game is going to be a masterpiece. That's what makes each masterpiece so special.

24:36.260 --> 24:38.740
It's important to understand where games go wrong,

24:38.820 --> 24:44.840
but we should also give credit where credit is due and not discard an entire body of work for minor infractions.

24:45.460 --> 24:49.380
Our favorite franchises from the 2000s may have fallen on hard times,

24:49.620 --> 24:54.420
but just like in every other decade, new ones will inevitably rise up to take their place.

24:55.060 --> 24:58.100
I feel like gaming is in a highly transitional state right now.

24:58.820 --> 25:05.620
Much like when video games transition from arcades to home consoles, there's a lot of chaos and uncertainty in the industry.

25:06.260 --> 25:11.080
So is the whole business just doomed to crash and burn and bury itself in the New Mexico desert?

25:11.620 --> 25:16.580
Most likely not, because as much as gamers like to complain and ridicule the games they play,

25:17.140 --> 25:19.540
we all know they're just going to buy the next one anyway.

25:20.020 --> 25:26.820
Even though it may seem like everyone hates games these days, people wouldn't get so frustrated if they didn't love games deep down.

25:26.820 --> 25:33.780
At the end of the day, everyone's just trying to recapture that feeling of total immersion in a virtual world,

25:34.260 --> 25:38.980
or at least any feeling besides the jaded, disgruntled cynicism of the real world.

25:39.460 --> 25:44.500
Not every game will help you accomplish this, so consider yourself lucky when you find one that does.

25:45.140 --> 25:50.020
Anyway, in conclusion, Pokémon GO was the most fun I had in any game from the past decade,

25:50.340 --> 25:53.800
and I rate NASCAR Thunder 04 an 8 out of 10.

25:56.820 --> 26:07.940
Bold, brazen, audacious, unapologetically defiant, these are the words I found in my thesaurus,

26:07.940 --> 26:14.100
which are necessary to describe the new Emperor Lemon Downward Spiral Signature Collection.

26:14.100 --> 26:20.580
Two years ago, Teespring unceremoniously removed my original design for trademark infringement.

26:20.580 --> 26:25.860
Well, guess what, you bunch of idiots? How about I remove myself from your entire website

26:25.860 --> 26:28.660
and start selling my stuff anywhere else?

26:28.660 --> 26:33.300
Emp was seriously pissed off, and for a moment there I thought there was going to be an incident,

26:33.300 --> 26:35.060
but luckily that didn't happen.

26:35.060 --> 26:39.380
Oh, you want to talk about trademark infringement? I'll show you trademark infringement.

26:39.380 --> 26:42.580
I'll give them the greatest trademark infringement anyone's ever seen.

26:42.580 --> 26:46.340
You know, these designs are quite similar to the ones they have at Doh! No!

26:46.340 --> 26:49.700
Battented Downward Spiral. Old family recipe.

26:49.700 --> 26:55.940
The new, totally not trademark infringement collection is now available at crowdmade.com

26:55.940 --> 27:02.340
slash emplemon or in the merchandise shelf beneath this very video, you lucky bastard.

27:02.980 --> 27:06.020
To be honest, I don't even think Emp is doing this for the money.

27:06.020 --> 27:10.020
I just think that he's really bitter about Teespring and wants to stick it to him.

27:10.020 --> 27:15.300
Oh, what's that? Teespring? Yeah, sorry, never heard of him. Must be an inferior brand.

27:15.300 --> 27:18.980
Why don't you go ahead and head over to crowdmade.com slash emplemon

27:18.980 --> 27:21.780
and get yourself a fabric print that won't wash out in a month.

27:26.900 --> 27:28.660
Did you juice yourself? I know I did.

27:28.660 --> 27:30.980
Hey yo, Cam's the name, Gamemaking's my game. Do you like RPGs?

27:30.980 --> 27:33.060
Because whether you do or you don't, frick you!

27:33.060 --> 27:36.100
Go to Kickstarter.com and check out the game away from home.

27:36.100 --> 27:37.780
You malnourished soy boy c-

27:39.940 --> 27:43.700
Shut up. It's not just a game. It's my life. And I can't just-

27:44.580 --> 27:49.540
Shut up. It's not just a game. It's my life. And I can't just let him think he can comment-

27:49.540 --> 27:52.260
Shut up. It's not just a game. It's my life.

27:52.260 --> 27:55.860
And I can't just let him think that he can comment and ruin my life like that.
