0	5700	Earlier this summer, I picked up NASCAR Thunder 2004 from a local flea market for seven dollars.
5860	11760	This game is regarded by NASCAR fans as the best NASCAR console release of all time.
11880	15800	A game that has not been topped more than 17 years after its release.
16120	22480	When I played it, I was astounded at the amount of content and gameplay variety available in a 2003 game.
23240	25480	Naturally, as we evaluate older media,
25480	30200	you have to excuse a certain level of crappiness due to the technical limitations of the era.
30520	37080	For example, a movie from 1982 is going to have significantly worse special effects than a movie in the present day,
37240	41160	so it's not really fair to judge older works along modern standards.
41400	48040	But just as we can forgive old media for their limitations, should we punish new media for a lack of progression?
49160	53360	Imagine taking a time machine back to 2003 and telling NASCAR fans,
53520	59280	this game right here, this is as good as it's gonna get. It's all downhill from here.
59440	64520	They would have thought that an asteroid must have wiped out the human civilization in 2004,
64760	69520	because how could it be possible that despite the exponential growth in processing power,
69520	72880	and with the video game industry earning record revenue,
73000	78200	not a single company has managed to make a better game nearly two decades into the future.
78200	82960	I feel like NASCAR Thunder represents a disturbing trend in video games as a whole.
83440	87440	In general, the last decade of games has been profoundly disappointing.
87760	91200	I want to clarify here that this is not my individual opinion,
91440	95840	rather the general consensus that I've perceived from the gaming community at large.
96400	99600	I feel like everyone entered the 2010s with such optimism.
100080	107440	So many of us were eagerly anticipating how the next-gen technology was going to completely transform the way we experienced our favorite games.
107440	113280	Half-Life, Fallout, Halo, Call of Duty, Mass Effect, World of Warcraft, Madden.
113280	117120	These franchises brought us some of the greatest games of the 2000s.
117280	121680	Little did we know just how hard all of these beloved series would fall off a cliff.
121680	127680	I polled my audience on Twitter what they would prefer if they could only play games from one of these decades,
128320	132160	and remarkably, 45% of respondents chose the 2000s.
132720	140400	This means that nearly half of all people would be willing to give up the entire 8th generation of consoles and a significant portion of the 7th gen.
140880	147360	They would be willing to give up better graphics, better performance, most online multiplayer games, most of the games on Steam,
147680	154000	most games on the App Store or Google Play, the most popular indie games, seamless DLC and patches,
154320	161200	cloud storage, fully integrated competitive lobbying, VR, Xbox Kinect, Raid Shadow Legends.
161680	166080	They would be willing to give up all of this to go play Wii Sports and Club Penguin.
166400	172480	Despite all of our next-gen technology, many people feel that the games today simply aren't as good.
172960	176160	So with that being said, what happened to video games?
176800	181600	The first and most obvious reason for this is the deterioration of game design.
182080	186400	15 years ago, you'd go to the store, purchase the game and own the finished product.
186960	192560	Then, somewhere along the way, companies figured out how to make players purchase the same game multiple times.
193340	202080	Nowadays, game studios have become all too comfortable rushing out broken, unfinished products and just patching in the rest of the content in the years after release.
202640	209920	Couple that with charging for DLC, microtransactions and pay-to-win mechanics, and consumers end up spending more for less.
210560	214400	This issue has been discussed to death here on YouTube because it's inherently
214780	220800	unsatisfying to pay full price for a game and not have it resemble a finished product until long after you've stopped caring.
221120	227300	This is a trend that's undoubtedly emerged over the past decade because if you released a broken game in the 2000s,
227920	235120	people just wouldn't buy it. But even worse than releasing broken games is releasing broken games with no intent on fixing them.
235600	239140	This has been a disastrous consequence of licensing at exclusivity.
239920	244400	And no other developer symbolizes this problem more than EA Sports.
245120	252900	Some of you today may find this hard to believe, but there was once a time when EA made great sports games like NASCAR Thunder 2004.
253520	259680	However, in just five years, EA went from releasing the best NASCAR console game of all time to one of the most
259900	268100	universally hated games in the genre. What happened? Well, starting in 2003, EA bought out the exclusive rights to the NASCAR license.
268420	274900	Prior to that, you had the NASCAR Heat and NASCAR Racing franchises all producing quality games alongside EA.
275060	281060	The competition forced these developers to release great products. After EA bought out the license,
281060	287460	they no longer had any incentive to outdo their competition, and the series slowly but surely deteriorated.
287900	295500	A similar outcome happened to the Madden and FIFA franchises, with the only difference being that EA is still holding them hostage to this day.
295900	303660	Couple that with 2K's recent string of duds, and we have entered a disturbing reality where there are practically no good sports games on the market.
304140	310540	These games used to be an integral part of every console generation, and now they just seem to exist to fill shelf space.
312220	320220	And due to the monopolistic nature of these licensing deals, it's unlikely that this trend will change anytime soon.
320780	326540	Players will just keep buying the same mediocre game every year because if you want the newest game from your favorite sport,
326860	328860	there are literally no other options.
329500	335660	Even without exclusive licenses, the overall selection of games over the past decade has felt rather limited.
335980	338860	It's a phenomenon I call the death of the simple game.
339340	344700	When I was a kid, I spent dozens of hours playing games like ATV 2, Midnight Club 3, Burnout 3.
345020	347900	These were all what I consider simple, good games.
348440	355340	Solid, fun titles that didn't necessarily set the world on fire with innovation, but were still nice to have in your library.
355820	361020	These were games that you could pick up and play for a couple of weeks and eventually revisit once a year or so.
361960	370140	Unfortunately, pretty much all these franchises died with a decade, and the 2010s were left with what felt like a huge void in good middle tier games.
370700	374540	It seems like most games these days are created to fit one of two extremes.
374940	382300	Either a crappy phone game you can play on the toilet, or a grandiose open world multiplayer battle royale with a 40-hour
382520	384640	cinematic story and epic cutscenes.
385100	391680	I believe the shift towards the latter can be attributed to by far the most successful game of the 2010s, Minecraft.
394540	400300	The meteoric rise of Minecraft led to a cataclysmic shift in what players expected out of a video game.
400860	404380	The amount of unique gameplay possibilities was virtually unlimited,
404860	410620	and it was not uncommon for players to dedicate hundreds, if not thousands of hours to this single game.
411260	416060	The same is true for Minecraft's less respected, but equally popular cousin, Roblox.
416760	421360	Previously, games like RuneScape and World of Warcraft would draw similar levels of dedication,
421820	428220	but they didn't come close to the immense mainstream popularity that Minecraft and Roblox continued to hold to this day.
429020	435840	All of the time spent on these two games is time that would have been shared among dozens of those smaller, simple games from the 2000s.
437000	441340	Unfortunately, this has made it difficult for studios to justify creating simple games,
441820	448300	because why would someone pay for a new game when they can just stick to the unlimited gameplay variety in a game they already own?
448700	453760	This all but forces modern publishers to release lazy free-to-play games riddled with microtransactions,
454720	461920	or haphazardly shove in as many bells and whistles as possible to create what is more often than not a disappointing and incoherent mess.
462240	465760	It's so dense. Every single image has so many things going on.
467840	474820	Another far-reaching consequence of Minecraft and Roblox is that they have forced every other game to prioritize online multiplayer,
475360	478260	which has, in turn, killed off local multiplayer.
479040	483680	Some of the most fun I had as a kid was playing Nintendo DS games on the bus before school.
484240	488980	The DS let you wirelessly connect to local multiplayer rooms without an internet connection,
489440	494000	and the best part was you could play games like Mario Kart without even owning the game yourself.
494640	500800	In my opinion, this was the peak of not just local multiplayer gaming, but handheld gaming, yet another genre
500800	506000	I used to really like that has gradually deteriorated over the past decade. Now don't get me wrong,
506080	508080	I don't hate online multiplayer.
508400	513860	My most played game of all time is Team Fortress 2, which is a strictly online multiplayer experience.
517680	525280	However, I'll be the first to admit that playing against random strangers online is simply not as fulfilling as playing alongside your friends and family
525360	527120	whom you see every day.
527120	532980	This has always been an essential part of what makes video games fun, going all the way back to the days of arcades.
533460	539780	To be perfectly honest, the ability to play with anybody from around the world will always be impressive on a technical level,
540100	545620	but the experience doesn't compare to the simple pleasures of just going to a friend's house to play Guitar Hero.
546100	549640	The harsh reality of online multiplayer is that it's very impersonal.
550480	554740	Ironically, despite having the potential to connect us with an infinite number of people,
555060	558680	online multiplayer has left us feeling more isolated than ever before.
559380	562680	Most of the time, it just feels like you're playing against very good CPUs.
562980	566420	Except they can trash talk you and call you bad for making a single mistake.
566980	569300	With friends, it's all just casual banter,
569300	574920	but with strangers, getting constantly flamed can turn a fun game into an incredibly frustrating experience.
575380	580680	Because of this, it's not surprising why online multiplayer games tend to carry the most toxic communities.
581220	585380	And as more studios shift away from local multiplayer in favor of online play,
585700	588980	it's no wonder why games are starting to feel less fun in general.
589460	596180	Speaking of which, the past decade has led to a significant portion of people who no longer engage with games for fun.
596820	602120	In many aspects, video games have become serious business, both literally and figuratively.
602820	606820	In a literal sense, the business of video games is seriously booming.
607360	611220	Recently, the gaming industry has become really good at making money,
611540	617140	and the money-making process has made things less fun for consumers and really not fun for developers.
617700	621860	The ever-increasing thirst for profit has corporatized the business at large.
622340	627460	Gone are the days of scrappy, passionate developers working to make their games the best that they can be.
628100	634980	Modern-day devs toil feverishly to meet impossible deadlines and end up creating products that both they and their audience hate.
635540	640500	Back in the day, this practice would manifest itself in the form of tacky, licensed shovelware,
640900	643220	but some of these games ended up being pretty good.
643780	649780	At least shovelware was far easier to avoid than the predatory business models currently infesting games today.
650340	657240	Modern-day games are designed to be more addictive than fun and will not hesitate to take more of the player's money at every opportunity.
657860	662020	For today's game companies, the only high score they care about is their profit margin.
662500	665780	It doesn't matter if games are good as long as they produce revenue.
666260	670180	However, the business of video games now extends far beyond the publishers.
670660	677140	Players can now go into business for themselves by making money from playing games on Twitch, YouTube, or as an esports competitor.
686980	690980	Ladies and gentlemen, the dream of every kid growing up in the 2000s is real.
691380	694360	But just like everything else, it wasn't at all what we expected.
694840	701400	As it turns out, playing games out of obligation rather than leisure is a great way to suck all the enjoyment out of whatever you're playing.
702040	709560	This leads to highly uncomfortable situations where people like Wings of Redemption force themselves to be publicly humiliated on a regular basis
709640	713000	in a game they hate because it's the only way to pay his bills.
713400	716280	I'm already playing a game I don't want to play to get views.
720440	722680	I really wish I weren't here right now.
723000	729480	As for competitive play, there's no shortage of people who completely burn themselves out trying to grind out an extra dozen elo points.
729960	735480	When winning is the only thing that matters, the experience starts to quickly unravel when you inevitably lose.
735480	740200	I'm done making League of Legends videos.
740600	747160	With more and more games introducing competitive laddering systems, more people end up taking the game way too seriously.
747480	749480	Look how mad you're getting over a game.
753240	757640	In either case, the end result remains the same. The game gets less fun.
758200	760120	Calm down, man.
760120	761880	It's just a game.
761880	763880	It's not just a game.
764520	766200	That's my life.
766200	768440	Since when did video games get so stressful?
768840	776520	It seems like you can't even talk about video games anymore without the whole conversation devolving into a bitter argument about the nature of society.
777080	782220	I miss the days when people would fight over whether the PS3 was better than the Xbox 360.
782520	786440	Nowadays, everything has to be shoehorned into some hackneyed political movement.
786840	790840	Gamer game. And yeah, yeah, I get it. All art is political.
791080	796120	It is absolutely vital that we dissect the socioeconomic themes of Shrek's Swamp Cart.
796520	801340	But what you may not realize is that most people play video games as a means of escapism.
802040	805560	Believe it or not, there are people out there in the world who don't have it so good.
805720	809880	And video games provide them with a brief reprieve from all of their problems.
810280	815960	So you may have to cut these people a little bit of slack if they don't want to dedicate their only moment of peace to
816100	818100	militant political activism.
818180	823400	However, the past decade has shown us that militant political activism has now become inescapable.
824020	831080	And if you don't use your platform to spread awareness about John C. Calhoun's toenail, then you don't care about the world's problems.
831540	833960	We live in an age of impossible expectations.
834580	840180	Everyone wants the best solution in the least amount of time and anything less than that is considered a failure.
840740	847860	This mindset applies to video games as well and has the debilitating effect of killing games before they even have the chance to succeed.
848420	851300	As soon as the hype train gets behind an upcoming title,
851460	856120	that game is doomed to a monsoon of ridicule if it falls anywhere short of perfection.
856580	860660	Back in the day, there was hardly any information about future game releases.
861060	865780	The first time you'd even know about a new game would be when you spotted it on the store shelves.
866340	870100	Everyone would play the game first then come up with their opinions about it later.
870580	877860	Nowadays, a game gets announced and you have a deluge of YouTubers, streamers, journalists, and forum posters all hyping it up months or even
878100	879380	years before it comes out.
879940	886500	Many people now make up their minds about a game without even playing it, all because their favorite YouTuber said that it sucked.
886900	890260	This can end up truly warping the public's perception of a game.
890660	895620	No Man's Sky was absolutely buried in hate after its lackluster release shattered the hype bubble.
896100	899700	And even though it has slowly but surely rebounded to a solid game,
900260	904040	many players still write it off for failing to meet their initial expectations.
905000	907480	So many new releases end up dead on arrival.
907880	915100	Just look at the disastrous launch of Artifact, a game that was instantaneously hated from the very moment it was revealed.
919080	922280	You can actually pinpoint the second when his heart rips in half.
923400	925000	And...
925000	926200	Now!
926200	930120	In a vacuum, Artifact is nothing more than an unremarkable card game,
930360	937320	but because it was attached to the prestigious Valve lineage of gems, this game was doomed to fail from its very premise.
937960	943400	If Artifact came out from any no-name developer, it could have gone down as a perfectly average game.
943800	948700	But when people have the expectation of your company releasing innovative masterpieces,
949320	951320	average doesn't cut it.
951320	954300	Great expectations make disappointment and inevitability.
954860	961500	This is why many of the most successful games over the past decade were barely promoted until after they were already on the market.
961980	967680	Compare that to a platform like Kickstarter, which has become notorious for churning out disappointment after disappointment.
968300	973020	The main issue here isn't necessarily that these projects were mediocre or behind schedule.
973260	978940	The true problem with sites like Kickstarter is that they generate massive hype for products that don't even exist yet.
979420	987340	Is it really justified to feel bamboozled when you agreed to financially back an intangible product because a bunch of people hyped it up on Reddit?
987820	991340	Social media has effectively homogenized everyone's opinions.
991740	995340	Public perception is now inexorably skewed by the circle jerk.
995820	1001660	Speaking of circle jerks, the modern era of online communication has also contributed to the rise of the fandom.
1002060	1007180	This is a topic I discussed in my Rick and Morty video that just as easily applies to video games.
1007580	1012540	We now occupy an age where otherwise good games can be tarnished by an obnoxious fandom.
1013020	1018060	The immersive nature of video games can spawn some of the most obsessive fans of any media type.
1018540	1021420	Fans who worship their favorite game like it's a religion.
1021820	1030220	It's fans like these who arguably contribute to the deterioration of game design in the industry by continually throwing money at new titles regardless of quality,
1030540	1033580	thus rewarding companies for predatory business practices.
1034220	1039920	However, for every mindless fanboy, the internet has created an equal and opposite stubborn contrarian.
1040540	1046400	The 2010s were unprecedented in the amount of cynicism and disillusionment within the general gaming community.
1046860	1051760	Contrast this with the 2000s when it seemed like every gamer was giddy with naive optimism.
1052680	1056940	Technology was progressing before our very eyes and there was so much to be excited about.
1057340	1062140	Just look at E3, what was once a whimsical wonderland where gamer dreams came true.
1062860	1066640	These days, E3 is basically treated as a giant cringe compilation.
1067340	1073740	It seems that as the games themselves have become less fun, gamers have had to seek out entertainment from other sources.
1074780	1080960	You pop this piece of crap in and what do you get? Well, I'm done making League of Legends videos.
1084060	1092060	YouTube critics like the angry video game nerd made an entire generation of gamers realize that deriding bad games could be just as fun as enjoying good games.
1092940	1098460	As it turns out, it's a lot more compelling to watch someone tell you why a game sucks rather than why it's good.
1099100	1103500	On YouTube, there's a market incentive to ridicule games as much as possible.
1103820	1107100	Nobody ever makes a video about a game being decently adequate,
1107420	1112060	but when a game misses the mark, all the biggest commentators come out and blast it.
1112440	1115580	Nowadays, everyone is aware of the circus that is Yandere Sim,
1115740	1120460	but how many of us can actually name a single other game in the genre? I know I can't.
1120860	1124380	I've never played a single anime related game in my entire life,
1124700	1131520	and yet my whole perception of the genre is negative because of a single eccentric story that's been blown up by YouTube commentators.
1132140	1140060	Online discourse puts the negativity bias on steroids, and it has without a doubt contributed to the prevailing cynicism of the past decade.
1140540	1147280	Sometimes it feels like people these days are actively rooting for games to fail so they can participate in the festival of mockery.
1147680	1151280	Twenty years ago when a game flopped, nobody really cared that much.
1151680	1156960	But when studios release a bad game now, they get absolutely hammered for months on end.
1157440	1161120	So with that in mind, if you're a game studio planning your next release,
1161440	1166420	why would you even want to risk provoking the online mob by attempting anything new or innovative?
1166720	1170480	The best course of action is to just play it safe by releasing bland,
1170700	1174720	formulaic crowd pleasers that most people will forget about before the end of the year.
1175120	1180900	At least then you avoid a flaming PR disaster, even if it does induce a perpetual state of mediocrity.
1181680	1188240	What makes this even worse is how relentlessly nitpicking games is now being treated as some kind of cool personality trait.
1188800	1194720	It seems like no matter what game you play these days, you'll encounter some jaded contrarian calling you dumb for liking it.
1195120	1202880	This elitist gatekeeping was nowhere near as prevalent in the past, as back then, nobody really cared what video games you played for fun.
1203520	1206820	Now they're treated as an indictment against your entire personality.
1207440	1210720	At least that's how it feels when you enter any comment section on the web.
1211200	1218960	The last decade has seen gamers become irrevocably polarized, so much so that it's impossible to tell what they really want anymore.
1219520	1224240	For so many years, gamers had this myopic obsession with graphics and realism,
1224560	1229280	to such an extent that they would weigh graphical fidelity higher than any other design aspect.
1229680	1234960	And now every game has amazing graphics, yet seem to be lacking in all other areas of design.
1235440	1239520	Graphics are better than ever before, while gamers have never been more miserable.
1240000	1246960	If it's not fun, why bother? Turns out that gamers, much like any other consumer base, don't really know what they want.
1247440	1253120	And now that most of us have been thoroughly put off by the uncanny valley mannequins of modern-day games,
1253440	1258180	we've actually seen studios moving back to the low poly cartoony aesthetics of the 2000s.
1259060	1264740	Gamers will complain about a franchise like Pokemon failing to innovate and releasing the same game over and over,
1265220	1271540	even though across practically all genres, sequels, remakes, and remasters continue to sell consistently well.
1271940	1277540	And I don't exactly see everyone rushing out to go buy the most experimental avant-garde titles at all times.
1278020	1280980	So you want a realistic down-to-earth game
1281700	1284980	that's completely off the wall and swarming with magic robots.
1285300	1290740	Ultimately, if you have a formula that works and makes money, why would you have any reason to change it?
1291220	1294820	Similarly, if you already have a library of games you enjoy playing,
1295140	1298660	why would you go out and buy a new one that you probably won't even like?
1299140	1303960	And that brings me to my final point about why modern games just don't feel as fun to play.
1308900	1313860	There is so much gaming content today that simply didn't exist 20 years ago.
1314180	1321460	People these days will spend hours playing a game, then hours watching YouTubers review games, then hours watching Twitch streamers play games.
1322100	1328820	None of these things are particularly bad on their own, but combined they can burn people out on new games faster than ever before.
1329300	1331480	After a while it all becomes a bit exhausting.
1332100	1337300	The market is so saturated with gaming related content that it's hard for anything to stand out.
1337300	1346180	At some point it's difficult to justify spending time caring about any new games because so many good ones already exist.
1346660	1351220	The sad truth is that most of us just can't get that excited about new games anymore.
1353620	1358580	In the 2000s we got to see major strides in technological progress year after year.
1359140	1365300	Stuff we take for granted today like online play and HD graphics used to be mind-blowing achievements back in the day.
1365860	1373140	But now that the current paradigm has fulfilled most of its potential, innovation as of late has felt much more marginal in its progress.
1373780	1378260	Once something becomes advanced enough you can only do so much to improve it further.
1378660	1382900	The differences between a PS1 game and a PS2 game are immediately clear.
1383300	1389300	But are PS3 games really that far off from PS4 games? In terms of specific game design,
1389300	1392580	many of the most compelling gameplay concepts have already been done.
1392980	1399060	I mean for the past five years the most popular games have all been different spin-offs of the battle royale game type.
1399540	1405780	Overwatch is just TF2 mixed with League of Legends. Valorant is just Counter-Strike mixed with Overwatch.
1406340	1411300	Pretty much any new game that comes out today is directly comparable to something that already exists.
1411940	1419460	It's for this reason that the 2010s have seen an unprecedented trend in players preferring to stick with older titles like TF2 and Melee.
1419860	1424680	These games feel like the ideal versions of what their successors have attempted to replicate.
1425220	1432180	Older games are also much more likely to have active modding communities who only seek to further perfect these already great titles.
1432660	1437080	Modders can often perform amazing feats with no budget deadlines or expectations.
1437780	1445140	Melee's community-created netplay is a free service that functions better than Nintendo's own dedicated servers for Smash Ultimate.
1445540	1450180	Which, by the way, you have to pay for. If you had to pick between these two options,
1450260	1456100	which would you honestly choose? And with all that being said, have video games been on a downward spiral?
1456660	1461620	I'm not going to sit here and tell you the answer because just like any video game out there, it's subjective.
1462980	1464980	But if you want my opinion on the matter,
1464980	1470420	I don't actually believe that things are as gloomy as the majority of internet commentators would have you believe.
1470980	1475780	Not every game is going to be a masterpiece. That's what makes each masterpiece so special.
1476260	1478740	It's important to understand where games go wrong,
1478820	1484840	but we should also give credit where credit is due and not discard an entire body of work for minor infractions.
1485460	1489380	Our favorite franchises from the 2000s may have fallen on hard times,
1489620	1494420	but just like in every other decade, new ones will inevitably rise up to take their place.
1495060	1498100	I feel like gaming is in a highly transitional state right now.
1498820	1505620	Much like when video games transition from arcades to home consoles, there's a lot of chaos and uncertainty in the industry.
1506260	1511080	So is the whole business just doomed to crash and burn and bury itself in the New Mexico desert?
1511620	1516580	Most likely not, because as much as gamers like to complain and ridicule the games they play,
1517140	1519540	we all know they're just going to buy the next one anyway.
1520020	1526820	Even though it may seem like everyone hates games these days, people wouldn't get so frustrated if they didn't love games deep down.
1526820	1533780	At the end of the day, everyone's just trying to recapture that feeling of total immersion in a virtual world,
1534260	1538980	or at least any feeling besides the jaded, disgruntled cynicism of the real world.
1539460	1544500	Not every game will help you accomplish this, so consider yourself lucky when you find one that does.
1545140	1550020	Anyway, in conclusion, Pokémon GO was the most fun I had in any game from the past decade,
1550340	1553800	and I rate NASCAR Thunder 04 an 8 out of 10.
1556820	1567940	Bold, brazen, audacious, unapologetically defiant, these are the words I found in my thesaurus,
1567940	1574100	which are necessary to describe the new Emperor Lemon Downward Spiral Signature Collection.
1574100	1580580	Two years ago, Teespring unceremoniously removed my original design for trademark infringement.
1580580	1585860	Well, guess what, you bunch of idiots? How about I remove myself from your entire website
1585860	1588660	and start selling my stuff anywhere else?
1588660	1593300	Emp was seriously pissed off, and for a moment there I thought there was going to be an incident,
1593300	1595060	but luckily that didn't happen.
1595060	1599380	Oh, you want to talk about trademark infringement? I'll show you trademark infringement.
1599380	1602580	I'll give them the greatest trademark infringement anyone's ever seen.
1602580	1606340	You know, these designs are quite similar to the ones they have at Doh! No!
1606340	1609700	Battented Downward Spiral. Old family recipe.
1609700	1615940	The new, totally not trademark infringement collection is now available at crowdmade.com
1615940	1622340	slash emplemon or in the merchandise shelf beneath this very video, you lucky bastard.
1622980	1626020	To be honest, I don't even think Emp is doing this for the money.
1626020	1630020	I just think that he's really bitter about Teespring and wants to stick it to him.
1630020	1635300	Oh, what's that? Teespring? Yeah, sorry, never heard of him. Must be an inferior brand.
1635300	1638980	Why don't you go ahead and head over to crowdmade.com slash emplemon
1638980	1641780	and get yourself a fabric print that won't wash out in a month.
1646900	1648660	Did you juice yourself? I know I did.
1648660	1650980	Hey yo, Cam's the name, Gamemaking's my game. Do you like RPGs?
1650980	1653060	Because whether you do or you don't, frick you!
1653060	1656100	Go to Kickstarter.com and check out the game away from home.
1656100	1657780	You malnourished soy boy c-
1659940	1663700	Shut up. It's not just a game. It's my life. And I can't just-
1664580	1669540	Shut up. It's not just a game. It's my life. And I can't just let him think he can comment-
1669540	1672260	Shut up. It's not just a game. It's my life.
1672260	1675860	And I can't just let him think that he can comment and ruin my life like that.
