0	8320	YouTube provides tools for rights holders to control the use of their content.
8320	12200	The happiest place on earth is a registered Disneyland copyright.
12200	14280	Now it's Spyro.
14280	16520	And it's heading for a great big lawsuit.
16520	18560	That's how the law works.
18560	20640	Enough is enough!
20640	24160	That's how the law works.
24160	25920	That's how the law works.
25920	27720	Oh, you stupid son of a...
27720	29680	The world is a mess.
29680	41400	You want to know how I got these scars?
41400	46040	You know, at first I thought YouTube's copyright system was a tragedy.
46040	51200	And now I realize it's a comedy.
51200	55840	I mean, in what other system can you follow all the rules and still get punished just
55840	58560	the same as the most treacherous criminals?
58560	59840	There's no order.
59840	62440	None of the rules mean anything.
62440	66940	It's all just complete and utter chaos.
66940	73600	It seems that the only thing more laughably cruel than YouTube's copyright system is society
73600	74600	itself.
74600	75600	That's it!
75600	79880	You people have stood in my way long enough!
79880	82160	I'm going to clown college!
82160	85880	Is it just me or is it getting a little corporate out there?
85880	91120	Everywhere you go on this website, someone's trying to sell you something.
91120	92120	Wait, who said that?
92120	98000	Well, anyway, lately it seems that everyone on YouTube is not doing stuff to have fun
98000	101200	and just doing it to make a lot of money.
101200	105400	It seems like you can't go anywhere anymore without seeing some forced ad that no one
105400	106400	cares about.
106400	108800	And you guys should know because you're watching one right now.
108800	110800	Is this a joke to you?
110800	111800	Yes!
111800	114680	This video is brought to you by the Ridge Family of Products.
114680	119400	The Ridge Wallet's sleek, minimalist design is perfect for me after copyright claimants
119400	120960	stole all of my ad revenue.
120960	123200	The day of reckoning will come.
123200	124200	Stay tuned.
124200	126920	Come on, just try and take the revenue from this ad.
126920	128560	This whole plant is insane!
128560	130080	Come on, come a little closer.
130080	131080	See what happens.
131080	133360	I've been waiting for you, Patrick!
133360	138320	Oh, sorry, YouTube, if I'm cutting into your family-friendly image.
138320	140840	Looks like things just got a little too edgy.
140840	145560	I didn't want to be non-advertiser-friendly on this literal advertisement.
145560	149480	Use code employment for 10% off your purchase.
149480	150480	Sure, go ahead.
150480	152560	You can take more of my money, too.
152560	156800	As a matter of fact, why don't you take what's inside the Ridge Wallet?
156800	161260	It's something really special that I saved just for you.
161260	163040	It's a downward spiral.
163040	168960	Downward spiral, downward spiral, downward spiral, downward spiral, downward spiral.
168960	172320	I turn myself into the physical manifestation of society, Morty.
172320	174320	I'm Joker Rick!
174320	176200	Enough from the clown.
176200	177200	Oh, what's the matter?
177200	181960	Aren't you all excited to hear yet another Emperor Lemon rant about YouTube?
181960	183720	Isn't that why most of you are here?
183720	185540	To listen to me complain?
185540	190080	You see, I can scrub off this makeup until I'm ripping the flesh from my skull, but it
190080	193600	won't make me feel like any less of a clown.
193600	196460	Taking off the makeup isn't treating the problem.
196460	199260	It's treating a symptom of the problem.
199260	203620	You'll never really fix anything until you diagnose the root cause.
203620	213780	YouTube's copyright system is a joke, but who's really laughing?
213780	218140	I'll admit that, throughout this series, my bias has been pretty obvious.
218140	223300	I'm not exactly the biggest fan of copyright law because, frankly, I don't respect it.
223300	228540	I fancy myself a bit of a copyright radical, an attitude forged from years of making YouTube
228540	232780	poops where you learn to treat every piece of media like just another pigment in your
232780	233780	artistic palette.
233780	238600	I figure as long as you're not directly re-uploading the content for free, then what difference
238600	242540	does it make when you use five seconds of a movie scene for a joke?
242540	245880	And that's not to say that copyright law is totally worthless.
245880	250660	There are certainly valid reasons for establishing copyright protection on some types of content.
253740	257700	So when I first released what is now known as the Knife Game song, it gained a lot of
257700	262300	internet attention and became a popular trend where many people would record versions of
262300	264860	themselves singing my original song.
264860	268740	And that was all fine and well, except for the fact that the song was quickly spiraling
268740	270260	out of my control.
270260	275260	Websites like Gawker and Huffington Post were attributing the song's creation to a 16-year-old
275260	279180	Norwegian girl, because it probably made for a better story.
279180	283460	People were using the song freely on TV shows, and basically it was looking like the Knife
283460	286940	Game song was just going to become absorbed into the internet.
286940	291900	The problem was, I was actually trying to sell the song on places like iTunes, so it
291900	296380	became necessary for me to go through the process of copywriting the song, to solidify
296380	299300	my ownership before it was too late.
299300	304420	So now, if shows like Ridiculousness want to use my song in one of their segments, which
304420	308500	they have, they have to contact me to negotiate a price.
308500	313100	Whereas if I'd never gotten official ownership of the song, anyone could profit off it without
313100	316500	me even being recognized as having written it.
316500	321820	Theoretically, copyright should function similarly to the patent system by protecting small creators
321820	324380	from getting run over by the corporate machine.
324380	329040	If you invent a new groundbreaking device, something's got to stop some big company from
329040	333700	just stealing your idea, mass producing it, and reaping all the benefits from your hard
333700	334700	work.
334700	339180	Conversely, when a corporation releases a new product, they get impacted by a much smaller
339180	344260	extent from some dude selling a bootleg version at a flea market.
344260	348660	Corporations can use their immense resources to continue making money regardless of patent
348660	349660	protection.
349660	355020	Ideally, copyright should function in a similar way to patents by protecting small artists,
355020	359300	but as the laws are currently administered, the opposite is true.
359300	364660	Copyright regulation overwhelmingly favors corporations over individuals by an enormous
364660	365660	margin.
365660	371520	Initially, US copyright law granted a 28-year protection period, comparable to the 20 years
371520	373380	granted to patents.
373380	378140	Intellectual property rights were kept relatively short for a reason, to provide artists and
378140	382460	inventors with enough time to effectively market their ideas, but not too much time
382460	385180	for them to complacently rest on their laurels.
385180	390460	A timely expiration is designed to incentivize artists and inventors to continue innovating
390460	393340	and contributing to the welfare of society.
393340	399000	When a patent or copyright expires, the intellectual property transfers to the public domain, meaning
399000	404000	that it's free to use for everyone, thus unlocking even more creative potential.
404000	409380	And while patent protection has remained largely the same, copyright protection has been continually
409380	413500	and arbitrarily extended to the point of absurdity.
413500	418500	Companies like Disney have repeatedly and successfully lobbied Congress to extend copyright
418500	423340	protection all so that their beloved corporate mascot won't fall into the grubby hands of
423340	426240	the public domain.
426240	431280	As a consequence, copyrighted works created today most likely won't be free to use until
431280	437540	over a century from now, and copyrighted works from nearly a century ago are still unusable.
437540	442600	The public domain is essentially frozen in time and will likely continue to be as Congress
442600	446080	continues to indefinitely extend copyright protection.
446080	451040	So instead of characters like Luke Skywalker or songs by the Beatles becoming free for
451040	456800	everyone to use, we have to stick to Humpty Dumpty and Old MacDonald, the exact same crap
456800	459520	people have been using since the 19th century.
459520	464440	I don't exactly see people racing to relive public lynchings, diphtheria, and railroad
464440	469080	spikes, so why is our public domain stuck in this era?
469080	475840	Also companies like Disney can continue clutching at 90 year old cartoons, a company that ironically
475840	481920	became a media empire by animating stories that they adopted from the public domain?
481920	484160	Copyright law is a joke.
484160	489520	Media companies always like to bemoan how pirating songs or movies hurts the artist
489520	494440	when the nasty copyright laws they push have done more to hurt artists than piracy ever
494440	495440	could.
495480	501280	By forming these huge concentrations of intellectual property and locking them behind a never-ending
501280	506880	copyright wall, you are restricting everyone's ability to freely express their creative vision
506880	509040	with contemporary media.
509040	512400	Remember how my video got claimed for a Cypress Hills song?
512400	518120	Well it turns out that entire genres of music like rap and EDM began by remixing and sampling
518120	519960	other copyrighted works.
519960	525360	And the same copyright goons that plague YouTube today went after the hip-hop artists of yesteryear.
526040	531960	In a 1991 court case, a judge ruled that all sampling required pre-approval from the copyright
531960	537080	owner and essentially crippled what was once a fundamental building block of the rap genre
537080	541840	by forcing hip-hop artists to pay licensing fees for all future samples.
541840	547320	You know, back in the days before three companies owned every song in existence, musicians were
547320	552680	mostly free to borrow ideas, co-op styles, and cover each other's songs without too much
552680	553680	issue.
553680	558920	It's understood that adapting older works was a natural part of innovating the medium.
558920	563960	Some of the biggest bands from the 60s and 70s built musical empires off the work of
563960	566840	lesser known artists from the 40s and 50s.
566840	572240	The Beatles truly were fortunate to exist during a time before strict copyright enforcement.
572240	576280	If they came up today, they probably wouldn't have had a career at all because ruthless
576280	580440	corporate giants would have sued the crap out of them before they even got the taste
580440	581600	of fame.
581600	585880	But hey, copyright regulation exists to benefit the artist, am I right?
585880	592360	I'm sure that EMI Warner Music provided fair compensation to Little Richard, Fats Domino,
592360	597200	Chuck Berry, Buddy Holly, Carl Perkins, and all the other artists who made the songs that
597200	600560	essentially composed the Beatles' early discography.
600560	605480	And I'm sure that after the Beatles got rich and successful and made those music companies
605480	611760	a lot of money, future artists had just as easy of a time covering Beatles songs.
611760	616320	Does copyright law only matter when you have the corporate backing to squash the worthless
616320	618000	plebeians beneath you?
618000	620160	Well, yes, of course.
620160	625080	Popular musicians nowadays are obligated to nickel and dime every single riff, melody,
625080	629080	or lyric that even slightly resembles anything they ever made.
629080	633980	So that means no covers of Let It Go from bedroom-dwelling YouTube teenagers and no
633980	635940	sampling for hip-hop artists.
635940	638900	That's how the law works.
638900	643300	And if you don't think that kneecapping an entire musical genre is bad enough, the
643300	649100	same copyright goons would later go on to demand royalties from the Girl Scouts of America
649100	653860	for singing their copyrighted works as campfire songs.
653860	658060	And if that's not enough to convince you of the absolute greed of those in favor of
658060	663700	modern copyright regulation, the copyright goons also pride Happy Birthday to you out
663700	669040	of the public domain and into their checking accounts by demanding royalties from any public
669040	670980	performance of the song.
670980	676440	So just a reminder to all of you out there, if you've ever sang Happy Birthday in Public,
676440	682460	the most recognized song in the English language, then you are a copyright criminal and owe
682460	684540	some company money.
684540	690260	Hopefully that will distract you from the fact that the song is 126 years old.
690260	695260	It was published in 1893.
695260	698260	1893.
698260	701260	1893.
701260	713260	It was published in 1893.
713260	715260	Are you getting any copyright claims?
715260	718260	What don't you understand about?
718260	719260	More!
719260	726260	All I get are copyright claims.
726260	730260	Madness!
730260	735900	I hope you realize now that any industry claims about how modern copyright laws are designed
735900	741580	to help the artist are an absolute crock of shit, and that they actually exist as a battering
741580	747220	ram to extort as much money out of individuals and artists as possible by ruthlessly hoarding
747220	752100	the ancient zombified remains of once profitable entertainment properties.
752100	757060	So you'll have to forgive me when I say that I don't exactly respect copyright laws and
757060	771080	that copyright smuggling doesn't keep me up at night with guilt.
771080	776100	It's easy to hate YouTube for copyright missteps, but they aren't the ones making the laws.
776100	781680	The fact of the matter is that current copyright legislation is simply incompatible with modern-day
781680	784300	peer-to-peer communication on the internet.
784300	789740	The laws by which YouTube are forced to comply were drafted during a time when barely anyone
789740	796460	used the internet by lawmakers who, to this day, probably still don't understand the internet
796460	798100	on a fundamental level.
798100	803700	The role of the internet has changed dramatically since 1998 to where it's almost unrecognizable
803700	808500	today, yet the law governing content sharing hasn't budged.
808500	813420	These stringent copyright laws may have worked 25 years ago when television and newspapers
813420	818580	served as information gatekeepers and people still had to pay to listen to music.
818580	822440	25 years ago, you'd pay $10 for a single CD.
822440	828660	Now you can pay $10 for access to every song ever made, and it's not even illegal.
828660	832700	Music companies have been forced to embrace streaming services because the internet has
832700	838140	quite simply transformed the way we treat information and intellectual property.
838140	843180	Copyright law still reflects the days when cable TV dominated the media landscape.
843180	847680	Back then, media companies were willing to walk on eggshells regarding copyright because
847680	852100	those same companies were willing to spend millions of dollars suing each other.
852100	856340	TV shows have big enough budgets to comfortably afford licensing fees.
856340	860500	They have long enough production cycles to solicit written permission for every piece
860500	861660	of media.
861660	867740	None of these resources are practical or even available for content creators on YouTube.
867740	872420	And this becomes a problem when these big media companies apply the same belligerent,
872420	877460	cutthroat policies to online creators that they're used to using on themselves.
877460	881760	The fact of the matter is that YouTubers have a totally different attitude towards content
881760	884220	creation and content sharing.
884220	886660	YouTube is by and large a cooperative setting.
886660	890700	There's no reason to ruthlessly compete with every channel you encounter because you'd
890740	895060	be much better off collaborating with them instead and sharing your audience.
895060	898300	Whenever I see any of my content in someone else's video,
898300	899300	Downward spiral.
899300	902640	I'm gonna dig straight to hell, genius.
902640	904140	my first reaction isn't,
904140	905140	Yo!
905140	908580	Can we copy strike PewDiePie's latest video?
908580	909580	It's
909580	916100	That's good.
916100	920500	There will come a day when copyright legislation will change to reflect the interests of online
920500	923780	artists, but I don't see it happening anytime soon.
923780	928140	It turns out that copyright reform isn't that high on the public agenda of problems for
928140	930380	our politicians to solve.
930380	935580	Even if it were, I'm sure that the geriatric turbo boomers in Congress would probably side
935580	937340	with corporate interests anyway.
937340	942580	Eventually, the digital cavemen will be outnumbered by younger politicians who pirated a song
942580	947620	off Napster at one time in their lives and copyright law will magically get better.
947740	951940	That's what needs to happen in the future, but what can we do to solve the problem now?
951940	957060	Well, currently, copyright law is so restrictive of the public domain that it has inadvertently
957060	960740	created a black market where everything is public domain.
960740	965580	You can look back through history at countless examples where the war on this or prohibition
965580	969660	of that did nothing to actually prevent what they were trying to prevent.
969660	975740	Authoritarian punishment of natural activities is not only unproductive, but often counterproductive
975740	977940	to the welfare of a society.
977940	984140	On the internet, sharing brief clips of television, movies, and music is a natural activity and
984140	988180	many of these companies don't realize that bludgeoning us over the head with copyright
988180	990860	claims won't stop people from doing that.
990860	995420	YouTubers don't use copyrighted content because they hate media companies and want them to
995420	996540	lose money.
996540	1001140	We use copyrighted content because it's the fundamental language of creative expression
1001140	1007140	on the internet and by impeding that, you're impeding the progression of culture and art.
1007140	1012060	And what has thus far transpired on YouTube is a cold war of sorts, a battleground between
1012060	1016940	old and new media where each side is content with silently resisting the other.
1016940	1021960	In these trying times, YouTube is stuck with the unfortunate task of attempting to reconcile
1021960	1024820	these vastly different perspectives.
1024820	1029340	YouTube's copyright system was the first of its kind on such a large-scale site.
1029340	1033220	It's certainly come a long way, but it still has a long way to go.
1033220	1038160	First of all, copyright claimants should not be in charge of reviewing appeals and counterclaims
1038160	1041720	because of how easily this leads to systematic abuse.
1041720	1046600	If YouTube claims to manually review videos for monetization, then surely they can do
1046600	1048740	the same for copyright disputes.
1048740	1053140	I don't care if they outsource it to some Indian mud farmer who's watching YouTube on
1053140	1054460	a potato.
1054460	1058480	Anything is more fair than having your appeal controlled by the same people who sent the
1058520	1060120	claim in the first place.
1060120	1065880	Second, when a rights holder claims five seconds of a 10-minute video, they should not be entitled
1065880	1069200	to 100% of the revenue from that video.
1069200	1074800	It's completely absurd for me to spend over a month on a 43-minute video and not earn
1074800	1079720	a cent of revenue from it because less than a tenth of a percent of it got copyright claimed
1079720	1081560	under false pretenses.
1081560	1086280	A fairer system would be for rights holders to take a share of revenue proportional to
1086280	1088360	the percentage used in the video.
1088360	1094020	That way, giant MediaCorp still gets to reap the rewards of TV show funny moments compilations
1094020	1097520	while more serious YouTubers don't get completely screwed.
1097520	1103060	And finally, YouTube should implement streamlined tools that allow YouTubers to license copyrighted
1103060	1107520	content so we don't have to resort to black market tactics.
1107520	1113480	The entire business of radio is built off running ads between broadcasts of copyrighted
1113480	1114480	music.
1114480	1118720	Radio stations pay a flat annual licensing fee and after that they're free to stream
1118720	1120280	whatever songs they want.
1120280	1125160	I really don't see how me playing a song as background music is any different from a radio
1125160	1131000	station doing it and I really don't see why YouTube can't have a similar licensing system.
1131000	1135800	Existing licensing methods are too slow and expensive to be compatible with the fast-paced
1135800	1137480	content on YouTube.
1137480	1142240	It's time to stop nickel and diming every single individual piece of media as if people
1142240	1145280	still go to the record store to pay for songs.
1145280	1150040	Music has already adapted to the streaming age and licensing should too.
1150040	1154360	Both YouTubers and media companies could benefit greatly from such a system.
1154360	1158100	I'm sure there are plenty of YouTubers who would gladly pay a hundred bucks a year to
1158100	1162440	guarantee that they can use any song they want without getting copyright claimed.
1162440	1166060	And even if you don't like that premise, you can't deny that it should at least be an option
1166060	1167740	for those who do.
1167740	1171560	This year, YouTube has already shown that they're willing to take steps towards reforming
1171560	1175960	the copyright system, but they still have a lot of work to do before the system becomes
1175960	1177600	truly equitable.
1177600	1183000	Until then, media companies will keep strangling us with claims, YouTubers will keep finding
1183000	1187860	ways to get around them, and the YouTube copyright metagame will continue.
1187860	1192120	So I guess at the end of the day, the lesson of this whole series is to just use Rusty
1192120	1196840	Cage's background music in all your videos because he's too busy stealing slushie machines
1196840	1200600	and epoxying dead rats to worry about sending you a claim.
1200640	1204680	Originally, I was going to end this video with Entry of the Gladiators.
1204680	1208480	You know, the clown theme.
1208480	1212280	But unfortunately, that song is going to get me copyright claimed.
1230600	1251480	Well, everyone, that's finally the end of my three part copyright detour.
1251480	1252720	Hope you guys liked it.
1252720	1257400	I know that nowadays it's kind of difficult to pay attention to these specific issues,
1257400	1261800	especially considering YouTube creates a new crisis seemingly every week now.
1261800	1266320	But copyright is an issue that's really bothered me for basically the entire time I've made
1266320	1271320	videos on this website, and I'm glad that I finally got a chance to talk about it here.
1271320	1275620	If you're interested in watching more content regarding copyright issues, I highly recommend
1275620	1280400	this video by Bedhead Bernie about the more philosophical problems with modern copyright
1280400	1281620	regulation.
1281620	1282940	So thanks for watching, everyone.
1282940	1287340	Be sure to check out that Ridge wallet, and I will catch you in the next one.
