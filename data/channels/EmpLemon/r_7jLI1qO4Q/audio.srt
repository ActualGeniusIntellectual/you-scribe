1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,320
YouTube provides tools for rights holders to control the use of their content.

2
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:12,200
The happiest place on earth is a registered Disneyland copyright.

3
00:00:12,200 --> 00:00:14,280
Now it's Spyro.

4
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:16,520
And it's heading for a great big lawsuit.

5
00:00:16,520 --> 00:00:18,560
That's how the law works.

6
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:20,640
Enough is enough!

7
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:24,160
That's how the law works.

8
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:25,920
That's how the law works.

9
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:27,720
Oh, you stupid son of a...

10
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:29,680
The world is a mess.

11
00:00:29,680 --> 00:00:41,400
You want to know how I got these scars?

12
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:46,040
You know, at first I thought YouTube's copyright system was a tragedy.

13
00:00:46,040 --> 00:00:51,200
And now I realize it's a comedy.

14
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:55,840
I mean, in what other system can you follow all the rules and still get punished just

15
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:58,560
the same as the most treacherous criminals?

16
00:00:58,560 --> 00:00:59,840
There's no order.

17
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:02,440
None of the rules mean anything.

18
00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:06,940
It's all just complete and utter chaos.

19
00:01:06,940 --> 00:01:13,600
It seems that the only thing more laughably cruel than YouTube's copyright system is society

20
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:14,600
itself.

21
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:15,600
That's it!

22
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:19,880
You people have stood in my way long enough!

23
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:22,160
I'm going to clown college!

24
00:01:22,160 --> 00:01:25,880
Is it just me or is it getting a little corporate out there?

25
00:01:25,880 --> 00:01:31,120
Everywhere you go on this website, someone's trying to sell you something.

26
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:32,120
Wait, who said that?

27
00:01:32,120 --> 00:01:38,000
Well, anyway, lately it seems that everyone on YouTube is not doing stuff to have fun

28
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,200
and just doing it to make a lot of money.

29
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:45,400
It seems like you can't go anywhere anymore without seeing some forced ad that no one

30
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:46,400
cares about.

31
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:48,800
And you guys should know because you're watching one right now.

32
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:50,800
Is this a joke to you?

33
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:51,800
Yes!

34
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:54,680
This video is brought to you by the Ridge Family of Products.

35
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:59,400
The Ridge Wallet's sleek, minimalist design is perfect for me after copyright claimants

36
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:00,960
stole all of my ad revenue.

37
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:03,200
The day of reckoning will come.

38
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:04,200
Stay tuned.

39
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:06,920
Come on, just try and take the revenue from this ad.

40
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:08,560
This whole plant is insane!

41
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:10,080
Come on, come a little closer.

42
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:11,080
See what happens.

43
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:13,360
I've been waiting for you, Patrick!

44
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:18,320
Oh, sorry, YouTube, if I'm cutting into your family-friendly image.

45
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:20,840
Looks like things just got a little too edgy.

46
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:25,560
I didn't want to be non-advertiser-friendly on this literal advertisement.

47
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:29,480
Use code employment for 10% off your purchase.

48
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:30,480
Sure, go ahead.

49
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:32,560
You can take more of my money, too.

50
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:36,800
As a matter of fact, why don't you take what's inside the Ridge Wallet?

51
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:41,260
It's something really special that I saved just for you.

52
00:02:41,260 --> 00:02:43,040
It's a downward spiral.

53
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:48,960
Downward spiral, downward spiral, downward spiral, downward spiral, downward spiral.

54
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:52,320
I turn myself into the physical manifestation of society, Morty.

55
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:54,320
I'm Joker Rick!

56
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:56,200
Enough from the clown.

57
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:57,200
Oh, what's the matter?

58
00:02:57,200 --> 00:03:01,960
Aren't you all excited to hear yet another Emperor Lemon rant about YouTube?

59
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:03,720
Isn't that why most of you are here?

60
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:05,540
To listen to me complain?

61
00:03:05,540 --> 00:03:10,080
You see, I can scrub off this makeup until I'm ripping the flesh from my skull, but it

62
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:13,600
won't make me feel like any less of a clown.

63
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:16,460
Taking off the makeup isn't treating the problem.

64
00:03:16,460 --> 00:03:19,260
It's treating a symptom of the problem.

65
00:03:19,260 --> 00:03:23,620
You'll never really fix anything until you diagnose the root cause.

66
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:33,780
YouTube's copyright system is a joke, but who's really laughing?

67
00:03:33,780 --> 00:03:38,140
I'll admit that, throughout this series, my bias has been pretty obvious.

68
00:03:38,140 --> 00:03:43,300
I'm not exactly the biggest fan of copyright law because, frankly, I don't respect it.

69
00:03:43,300 --> 00:03:48,540
I fancy myself a bit of a copyright radical, an attitude forged from years of making YouTube

70
00:03:48,540 --> 00:03:52,780
poops where you learn to treat every piece of media like just another pigment in your

71
00:03:52,780 --> 00:03:53,780
artistic palette.

72
00:03:53,780 --> 00:03:58,600
I figure as long as you're not directly re-uploading the content for free, then what difference

73
00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:02,540
does it make when you use five seconds of a movie scene for a joke?

74
00:04:02,540 --> 00:04:05,880
And that's not to say that copyright law is totally worthless.

75
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:10,660
There are certainly valid reasons for establishing copyright protection on some types of content.

76
00:04:13,740 --> 00:04:17,700
So when I first released what is now known as the Knife Game song, it gained a lot of

77
00:04:17,700 --> 00:04:22,300
internet attention and became a popular trend where many people would record versions of

78
00:04:22,300 --> 00:04:24,860
themselves singing my original song.

79
00:04:24,860 --> 00:04:28,740
And that was all fine and well, except for the fact that the song was quickly spiraling

80
00:04:28,740 --> 00:04:30,260
out of my control.

81
00:04:30,260 --> 00:04:35,260
Websites like Gawker and Huffington Post were attributing the song's creation to a 16-year-old

82
00:04:35,260 --> 00:04:39,180
Norwegian girl, because it probably made for a better story.

83
00:04:39,180 --> 00:04:43,460
People were using the song freely on TV shows, and basically it was looking like the Knife

84
00:04:43,460 --> 00:04:46,940
Game song was just going to become absorbed into the internet.

85
00:04:46,940 --> 00:04:51,900
The problem was, I was actually trying to sell the song on places like iTunes, so it

86
00:04:51,900 --> 00:04:56,380
became necessary for me to go through the process of copywriting the song, to solidify

87
00:04:56,380 --> 00:04:59,300
my ownership before it was too late.

88
00:04:59,300 --> 00:05:04,420
So now, if shows like Ridiculousness want to use my song in one of their segments, which

89
00:05:04,420 --> 00:05:08,500
they have, they have to contact me to negotiate a price.

90
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:13,100
Whereas if I'd never gotten official ownership of the song, anyone could profit off it without

91
00:05:13,100 --> 00:05:16,500
me even being recognized as having written it.

92
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:21,820
Theoretically, copyright should function similarly to the patent system by protecting small creators

93
00:05:21,820 --> 00:05:24,380
from getting run over by the corporate machine.

94
00:05:24,380 --> 00:05:29,040
If you invent a new groundbreaking device, something's got to stop some big company from

95
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:33,700
just stealing your idea, mass producing it, and reaping all the benefits from your hard

96
00:05:33,700 --> 00:05:34,700
work.

97
00:05:34,700 --> 00:05:39,180
Conversely, when a corporation releases a new product, they get impacted by a much smaller

98
00:05:39,180 --> 00:05:44,260
extent from some dude selling a bootleg version at a flea market.

99
00:05:44,260 --> 00:05:48,660
Corporations can use their immense resources to continue making money regardless of patent

100
00:05:48,660 --> 00:05:49,660
protection.

101
00:05:49,660 --> 00:05:55,020
Ideally, copyright should function in a similar way to patents by protecting small artists,

102
00:05:55,020 --> 00:05:59,300
but as the laws are currently administered, the opposite is true.

103
00:05:59,300 --> 00:06:04,660
Copyright regulation overwhelmingly favors corporations over individuals by an enormous

104
00:06:04,660 --> 00:06:05,660
margin.

105
00:06:05,660 --> 00:06:11,520
Initially, US copyright law granted a 28-year protection period, comparable to the 20 years

106
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:13,380
granted to patents.

107
00:06:13,380 --> 00:06:18,140
Intellectual property rights were kept relatively short for a reason, to provide artists and

108
00:06:18,140 --> 00:06:22,460
inventors with enough time to effectively market their ideas, but not too much time

109
00:06:22,460 --> 00:06:25,180
for them to complacently rest on their laurels.

110
00:06:25,180 --> 00:06:30,460
A timely expiration is designed to incentivize artists and inventors to continue innovating

111
00:06:30,460 --> 00:06:33,340
and contributing to the welfare of society.

112
00:06:33,340 --> 00:06:39,000
When a patent or copyright expires, the intellectual property transfers to the public domain, meaning

113
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:44,000
that it's free to use for everyone, thus unlocking even more creative potential.

114
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:49,380
And while patent protection has remained largely the same, copyright protection has been continually

115
00:06:49,380 --> 00:06:53,500
and arbitrarily extended to the point of absurdity.

116
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:58,500
Companies like Disney have repeatedly and successfully lobbied Congress to extend copyright

117
00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:03,340
protection all so that their beloved corporate mascot won't fall into the grubby hands of

118
00:07:03,340 --> 00:07:06,240
the public domain.

119
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:11,280
As a consequence, copyrighted works created today most likely won't be free to use until

120
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:17,540
over a century from now, and copyrighted works from nearly a century ago are still unusable.

121
00:07:17,540 --> 00:07:22,600
The public domain is essentially frozen in time and will likely continue to be as Congress

122
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:26,080
continues to indefinitely extend copyright protection.

123
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:31,040
So instead of characters like Luke Skywalker or songs by the Beatles becoming free for

124
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:36,800
everyone to use, we have to stick to Humpty Dumpty and Old MacDonald, the exact same crap

125
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:39,520
people have been using since the 19th century.

126
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:44,440
I don't exactly see people racing to relive public lynchings, diphtheria, and railroad

127
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:49,080
spikes, so why is our public domain stuck in this era?

128
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:55,840
Also companies like Disney can continue clutching at 90 year old cartoons, a company that ironically

129
00:07:55,840 --> 00:08:01,920
became a media empire by animating stories that they adopted from the public domain?

130
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:04,160
Copyright law is a joke.

131
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:09,520
Media companies always like to bemoan how pirating songs or movies hurts the artist

132
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:14,440
when the nasty copyright laws they push have done more to hurt artists than piracy ever

133
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:15,440
could.

134
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:21,280
By forming these huge concentrations of intellectual property and locking them behind a never-ending

135
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:26,880
copyright wall, you are restricting everyone's ability to freely express their creative vision

136
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:29,040
with contemporary media.

137
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:32,400
Remember how my video got claimed for a Cypress Hills song?

138
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:38,120
Well it turns out that entire genres of music like rap and EDM began by remixing and sampling

139
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:39,960
other copyrighted works.

140
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:45,360
And the same copyright goons that plague YouTube today went after the hip-hop artists of yesteryear.

141
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:51,960
In a 1991 court case, a judge ruled that all sampling required pre-approval from the copyright

142
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:57,080
owner and essentially crippled what was once a fundamental building block of the rap genre

143
00:08:57,080 --> 00:09:01,840
by forcing hip-hop artists to pay licensing fees for all future samples.

144
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:07,320
You know, back in the days before three companies owned every song in existence, musicians were

145
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:12,680
mostly free to borrow ideas, co-op styles, and cover each other's songs without too much

146
00:09:12,680 --> 00:09:13,680
issue.

147
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:18,920
It's understood that adapting older works was a natural part of innovating the medium.

148
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:23,960
Some of the biggest bands from the 60s and 70s built musical empires off the work of

149
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:26,840
lesser known artists from the 40s and 50s.

150
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:32,240
The Beatles truly were fortunate to exist during a time before strict copyright enforcement.

151
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:36,280
If they came up today, they probably wouldn't have had a career at all because ruthless

152
00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:40,440
corporate giants would have sued the crap out of them before they even got the taste

153
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:41,600
of fame.

154
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:45,880
But hey, copyright regulation exists to benefit the artist, am I right?

155
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:52,360
I'm sure that EMI Warner Music provided fair compensation to Little Richard, Fats Domino,

156
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:57,200
Chuck Berry, Buddy Holly, Carl Perkins, and all the other artists who made the songs that

157
00:09:57,200 --> 00:10:00,560
essentially composed the Beatles' early discography.

158
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:05,480
And I'm sure that after the Beatles got rich and successful and made those music companies

159
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:11,760
a lot of money, future artists had just as easy of a time covering Beatles songs.

160
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:16,320
Does copyright law only matter when you have the corporate backing to squash the worthless

161
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:18,000
plebeians beneath you?

162
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,160
Well, yes, of course.

163
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:25,080
Popular musicians nowadays are obligated to nickel and dime every single riff, melody,

164
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:29,080
or lyric that even slightly resembles anything they ever made.

165
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:33,980
So that means no covers of Let It Go from bedroom-dwelling YouTube teenagers and no

166
00:10:33,980 --> 00:10:35,940
sampling for hip-hop artists.

167
00:10:35,940 --> 00:10:38,900
That's how the law works.

168
00:10:38,900 --> 00:10:43,300
And if you don't think that kneecapping an entire musical genre is bad enough, the

169
00:10:43,300 --> 00:10:49,100
same copyright goons would later go on to demand royalties from the Girl Scouts of America

170
00:10:49,100 --> 00:10:53,860
for singing their copyrighted works as campfire songs.

171
00:10:53,860 --> 00:10:58,060
And if that's not enough to convince you of the absolute greed of those in favor of

172
00:10:58,060 --> 00:11:03,700
modern copyright regulation, the copyright goons also pride Happy Birthday to you out

173
00:11:03,700 --> 00:11:09,040
of the public domain and into their checking accounts by demanding royalties from any public

174
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:10,980
performance of the song.

175
00:11:10,980 --> 00:11:16,440
So just a reminder to all of you out there, if you've ever sang Happy Birthday in Public,

176
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:22,460
the most recognized song in the English language, then you are a copyright criminal and owe

177
00:11:22,460 --> 00:11:24,540
some company money.

178
00:11:24,540 --> 00:11:30,260
Hopefully that will distract you from the fact that the song is 126 years old.

179
00:11:30,260 --> 00:11:35,260
It was published in 1893.

180
00:11:35,260 --> 00:11:38,260
1893.

181
00:11:38,260 --> 00:11:41,260
1893.

182
00:11:41,260 --> 00:11:53,260
It was published in 1893.

183
00:11:53,260 --> 00:11:55,260
Are you getting any copyright claims?

184
00:11:55,260 --> 00:11:58,260
What don't you understand about?

185
00:11:58,260 --> 00:11:59,260
More!

186
00:11:59,260 --> 00:12:06,260
All I get are copyright claims.

187
00:12:06,260 --> 00:12:10,260
Madness!

188
00:12:10,260 --> 00:12:15,900
I hope you realize now that any industry claims about how modern copyright laws are designed

189
00:12:15,900 --> 00:12:21,580
to help the artist are an absolute crock of shit, and that they actually exist as a battering

190
00:12:21,580 --> 00:12:27,220
ram to extort as much money out of individuals and artists as possible by ruthlessly hoarding

191
00:12:27,220 --> 00:12:32,100
the ancient zombified remains of once profitable entertainment properties.

192
00:12:32,100 --> 00:12:37,060
So you'll have to forgive me when I say that I don't exactly respect copyright laws and

193
00:12:37,060 --> 00:12:51,080
that copyright smuggling doesn't keep me up at night with guilt.

194
00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:56,100
It's easy to hate YouTube for copyright missteps, but they aren't the ones making the laws.

195
00:12:56,100 --> 00:13:01,680
The fact of the matter is that current copyright legislation is simply incompatible with modern-day

196
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:04,300
peer-to-peer communication on the internet.

197
00:13:04,300 --> 00:13:09,740
The laws by which YouTube are forced to comply were drafted during a time when barely anyone

198
00:13:09,740 --> 00:13:16,460
used the internet by lawmakers who, to this day, probably still don't understand the internet

199
00:13:16,460 --> 00:13:18,100
on a fundamental level.

200
00:13:18,100 --> 00:13:23,700
The role of the internet has changed dramatically since 1998 to where it's almost unrecognizable

201
00:13:23,700 --> 00:13:28,500
today, yet the law governing content sharing hasn't budged.

202
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:33,420
These stringent copyright laws may have worked 25 years ago when television and newspapers

203
00:13:33,420 --> 00:13:38,580
served as information gatekeepers and people still had to pay to listen to music.

204
00:13:38,580 --> 00:13:42,440
25 years ago, you'd pay $10 for a single CD.

205
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:48,660
Now you can pay $10 for access to every song ever made, and it's not even illegal.

206
00:13:48,660 --> 00:13:52,700
Music companies have been forced to embrace streaming services because the internet has

207
00:13:52,700 --> 00:13:58,140
quite simply transformed the way we treat information and intellectual property.

208
00:13:58,140 --> 00:14:03,180
Copyright law still reflects the days when cable TV dominated the media landscape.

209
00:14:03,180 --> 00:14:07,680
Back then, media companies were willing to walk on eggshells regarding copyright because

210
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:12,100
those same companies were willing to spend millions of dollars suing each other.

211
00:14:12,100 --> 00:14:16,340
TV shows have big enough budgets to comfortably afford licensing fees.

212
00:14:16,340 --> 00:14:20,500
They have long enough production cycles to solicit written permission for every piece

213
00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:21,660
of media.

214
00:14:21,660 --> 00:14:27,740
None of these resources are practical or even available for content creators on YouTube.

215
00:14:27,740 --> 00:14:32,420
And this becomes a problem when these big media companies apply the same belligerent,

216
00:14:32,420 --> 00:14:37,460
cutthroat policies to online creators that they're used to using on themselves.

217
00:14:37,460 --> 00:14:41,760
The fact of the matter is that YouTubers have a totally different attitude towards content

218
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:44,220
creation and content sharing.

219
00:14:44,220 --> 00:14:46,660
YouTube is by and large a cooperative setting.

220
00:14:46,660 --> 00:14:50,700
There's no reason to ruthlessly compete with every channel you encounter because you'd

221
00:14:50,740 --> 00:14:55,060
be much better off collaborating with them instead and sharing your audience.

222
00:14:55,060 --> 00:14:58,300
Whenever I see any of my content in someone else's video,

223
00:14:58,300 --> 00:14:59,300
Downward spiral.

224
00:14:59,300 --> 00:15:02,640
I'm gonna dig straight to hell, genius.

225
00:15:02,640 --> 00:15:04,140
my first reaction isn't,

226
00:15:04,140 --> 00:15:05,140
Yo!

227
00:15:05,140 --> 00:15:08,580
Can we copy strike PewDiePie's latest video?

228
00:15:08,580 --> 00:15:09,580
It's

229
00:15:09,580 --> 00:15:16,100
That's good.

230
00:15:16,100 --> 00:15:20,500
There will come a day when copyright legislation will change to reflect the interests of online

231
00:15:20,500 --> 00:15:23,780
artists, but I don't see it happening anytime soon.

232
00:15:23,780 --> 00:15:28,140
It turns out that copyright reform isn't that high on the public agenda of problems for

233
00:15:28,140 --> 00:15:30,380
our politicians to solve.

234
00:15:30,380 --> 00:15:35,580
Even if it were, I'm sure that the geriatric turbo boomers in Congress would probably side

235
00:15:35,580 --> 00:15:37,340
with corporate interests anyway.

236
00:15:37,340 --> 00:15:42,580
Eventually, the digital cavemen will be outnumbered by younger politicians who pirated a song

237
00:15:42,580 --> 00:15:47,620
off Napster at one time in their lives and copyright law will magically get better.

238
00:15:47,740 --> 00:15:51,940
That's what needs to happen in the future, but what can we do to solve the problem now?

239
00:15:51,940 --> 00:15:57,060
Well, currently, copyright law is so restrictive of the public domain that it has inadvertently

240
00:15:57,060 --> 00:16:00,740
created a black market where everything is public domain.

241
00:16:00,740 --> 00:16:05,580
You can look back through history at countless examples where the war on this or prohibition

242
00:16:05,580 --> 00:16:09,660
of that did nothing to actually prevent what they were trying to prevent.

243
00:16:09,660 --> 00:16:15,740
Authoritarian punishment of natural activities is not only unproductive, but often counterproductive

244
00:16:15,740 --> 00:16:17,940
to the welfare of a society.

245
00:16:17,940 --> 00:16:24,140
On the internet, sharing brief clips of television, movies, and music is a natural activity and

246
00:16:24,140 --> 00:16:28,180
many of these companies don't realize that bludgeoning us over the head with copyright

247
00:16:28,180 --> 00:16:30,860
claims won't stop people from doing that.

248
00:16:30,860 --> 00:16:35,420
YouTubers don't use copyrighted content because they hate media companies and want them to

249
00:16:35,420 --> 00:16:36,540
lose money.

250
00:16:36,540 --> 00:16:41,140
We use copyrighted content because it's the fundamental language of creative expression

251
00:16:41,140 --> 00:16:47,140
on the internet and by impeding that, you're impeding the progression of culture and art.

252
00:16:47,140 --> 00:16:52,060
And what has thus far transpired on YouTube is a cold war of sorts, a battleground between

253
00:16:52,060 --> 00:16:56,940
old and new media where each side is content with silently resisting the other.

254
00:16:56,940 --> 00:17:01,960
In these trying times, YouTube is stuck with the unfortunate task of attempting to reconcile

255
00:17:01,960 --> 00:17:04,820
these vastly different perspectives.

256
00:17:04,820 --> 00:17:09,340
YouTube's copyright system was the first of its kind on such a large-scale site.

257
00:17:09,340 --> 00:17:13,220
It's certainly come a long way, but it still has a long way to go.

258
00:17:13,220 --> 00:17:18,160
First of all, copyright claimants should not be in charge of reviewing appeals and counterclaims

259
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:21,720
because of how easily this leads to systematic abuse.

260
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:26,600
If YouTube claims to manually review videos for monetization, then surely they can do

261
00:17:26,600 --> 00:17:28,740
the same for copyright disputes.

262
00:17:28,740 --> 00:17:33,140
I don't care if they outsource it to some Indian mud farmer who's watching YouTube on

263
00:17:33,140 --> 00:17:34,460
a potato.

264
00:17:34,460 --> 00:17:38,480
Anything is more fair than having your appeal controlled by the same people who sent the

265
00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:40,120
claim in the first place.

266
00:17:40,120 --> 00:17:45,880
Second, when a rights holder claims five seconds of a 10-minute video, they should not be entitled

267
00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:49,200
to 100% of the revenue from that video.

268
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:54,800
It's completely absurd for me to spend over a month on a 43-minute video and not earn

269
00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:59,720
a cent of revenue from it because less than a tenth of a percent of it got copyright claimed

270
00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:01,560
under false pretenses.

271
00:18:01,560 --> 00:18:06,280
A fairer system would be for rights holders to take a share of revenue proportional to

272
00:18:06,280 --> 00:18:08,360
the percentage used in the video.

273
00:18:08,360 --> 00:18:14,020
That way, giant MediaCorp still gets to reap the rewards of TV show funny moments compilations

274
00:18:14,020 --> 00:18:17,520
while more serious YouTubers don't get completely screwed.

275
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:23,060
And finally, YouTube should implement streamlined tools that allow YouTubers to license copyrighted

276
00:18:23,060 --> 00:18:27,520
content so we don't have to resort to black market tactics.

277
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:33,480
The entire business of radio is built off running ads between broadcasts of copyrighted

278
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:34,480
music.

279
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:38,720
Radio stations pay a flat annual licensing fee and after that they're free to stream

280
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:40,280
whatever songs they want.

281
00:18:40,280 --> 00:18:45,160
I really don't see how me playing a song as background music is any different from a radio

282
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:51,000
station doing it and I really don't see why YouTube can't have a similar licensing system.

283
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:55,800
Existing licensing methods are too slow and expensive to be compatible with the fast-paced

284
00:18:55,800 --> 00:18:57,480
content on YouTube.

285
00:18:57,480 --> 00:19:02,240
It's time to stop nickel and diming every single individual piece of media as if people

286
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:05,280
still go to the record store to pay for songs.

287
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:10,040
Music has already adapted to the streaming age and licensing should too.

288
00:19:10,040 --> 00:19:14,360
Both YouTubers and media companies could benefit greatly from such a system.

289
00:19:14,360 --> 00:19:18,100
I'm sure there are plenty of YouTubers who would gladly pay a hundred bucks a year to

290
00:19:18,100 --> 00:19:22,440
guarantee that they can use any song they want without getting copyright claimed.

291
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:26,060
And even if you don't like that premise, you can't deny that it should at least be an option

292
00:19:26,060 --> 00:19:27,740
for those who do.

293
00:19:27,740 --> 00:19:31,560
This year, YouTube has already shown that they're willing to take steps towards reforming

294
00:19:31,560 --> 00:19:35,960
the copyright system, but they still have a lot of work to do before the system becomes

295
00:19:35,960 --> 00:19:37,600
truly equitable.

296
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:43,000
Until then, media companies will keep strangling us with claims, YouTubers will keep finding

297
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:47,860
ways to get around them, and the YouTube copyright metagame will continue.

298
00:19:47,860 --> 00:19:52,120
So I guess at the end of the day, the lesson of this whole series is to just use Rusty

299
00:19:52,120 --> 00:19:56,840
Cage's background music in all your videos because he's too busy stealing slushie machines

300
00:19:56,840 --> 00:20:00,600
and epoxying dead rats to worry about sending you a claim.

301
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:04,680
Originally, I was going to end this video with Entry of the Gladiators.

302
00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:08,480
You know, the clown theme.

303
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:12,280
But unfortunately, that song is going to get me copyright claimed.

304
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:51,480
Well, everyone, that's finally the end of my three part copyright detour.

305
00:20:51,480 --> 00:20:52,720
Hope you guys liked it.

306
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:57,400
I know that nowadays it's kind of difficult to pay attention to these specific issues,

307
00:20:57,400 --> 00:21:01,800
especially considering YouTube creates a new crisis seemingly every week now.

308
00:21:01,800 --> 00:21:06,320
But copyright is an issue that's really bothered me for basically the entire time I've made

309
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:11,320
videos on this website, and I'm glad that I finally got a chance to talk about it here.

310
00:21:11,320 --> 00:21:15,620
If you're interested in watching more content regarding copyright issues, I highly recommend

311
00:21:15,620 --> 00:21:20,400
this video by Bedhead Bernie about the more philosophical problems with modern copyright

312
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:21,620
regulation.

313
00:21:21,620 --> 00:21:22,940
So thanks for watching, everyone.

314
00:21:22,940 --> 00:21:27,340
Be sure to check out that Ridge wallet, and I will catch you in the next one.
