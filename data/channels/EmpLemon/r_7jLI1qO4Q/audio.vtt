00:00.000 --> 00:08.320
YouTube provides tools for rights holders to control the use of their content.

00:08.320 --> 00:12.200
The happiest place on earth is a registered Disneyland copyright.

00:12.200 --> 00:14.280
Now it's Spyro.

00:14.280 --> 00:16.520
And it's heading for a great big lawsuit.

00:16.520 --> 00:18.560
That's how the law works.

00:18.560 --> 00:20.640
Enough is enough!

00:20.640 --> 00:24.160
That's how the law works.

00:24.160 --> 00:25.920
That's how the law works.

00:25.920 --> 00:27.720
Oh, you stupid son of a...

00:27.720 --> 00:29.680
The world is a mess.

00:29.680 --> 00:41.400
You want to know how I got these scars?

00:41.400 --> 00:46.040
You know, at first I thought YouTube's copyright system was a tragedy.

00:46.040 --> 00:51.200
And now I realize it's a comedy.

00:51.200 --> 00:55.840
I mean, in what other system can you follow all the rules and still get punished just

00:55.840 --> 00:58.560
the same as the most treacherous criminals?

00:58.560 --> 00:59.840
There's no order.

00:59.840 --> 01:02.440
None of the rules mean anything.

01:02.440 --> 01:06.940
It's all just complete and utter chaos.

01:06.940 --> 01:13.600
It seems that the only thing more laughably cruel than YouTube's copyright system is society

01:13.600 --> 01:14.600
itself.

01:14.600 --> 01:15.600
That's it!

01:15.600 --> 01:19.880
You people have stood in my way long enough!

01:19.880 --> 01:22.160
I'm going to clown college!

01:22.160 --> 01:25.880
Is it just me or is it getting a little corporate out there?

01:25.880 --> 01:31.120
Everywhere you go on this website, someone's trying to sell you something.

01:31.120 --> 01:32.120
Wait, who said that?

01:32.120 --> 01:38.000
Well, anyway, lately it seems that everyone on YouTube is not doing stuff to have fun

01:38.000 --> 01:41.200
and just doing it to make a lot of money.

01:41.200 --> 01:45.400
It seems like you can't go anywhere anymore without seeing some forced ad that no one

01:45.400 --> 01:46.400
cares about.

01:46.400 --> 01:48.800
And you guys should know because you're watching one right now.

01:48.800 --> 01:50.800
Is this a joke to you?

01:50.800 --> 01:51.800
Yes!

01:51.800 --> 01:54.680
This video is brought to you by the Ridge Family of Products.

01:54.680 --> 01:59.400
The Ridge Wallet's sleek, minimalist design is perfect for me after copyright claimants

01:59.400 --> 02:00.960
stole all of my ad revenue.

02:00.960 --> 02:03.200
The day of reckoning will come.

02:03.200 --> 02:04.200
Stay tuned.

02:04.200 --> 02:06.920
Come on, just try and take the revenue from this ad.

02:06.920 --> 02:08.560
This whole plant is insane!

02:08.560 --> 02:10.080
Come on, come a little closer.

02:10.080 --> 02:11.080
See what happens.

02:11.080 --> 02:13.360
I've been waiting for you, Patrick!

02:13.360 --> 02:18.320
Oh, sorry, YouTube, if I'm cutting into your family-friendly image.

02:18.320 --> 02:20.840
Looks like things just got a little too edgy.

02:20.840 --> 02:25.560
I didn't want to be non-advertiser-friendly on this literal advertisement.

02:25.560 --> 02:29.480
Use code employment for 10% off your purchase.

02:29.480 --> 02:30.480
Sure, go ahead.

02:30.480 --> 02:32.560
You can take more of my money, too.

02:32.560 --> 02:36.800
As a matter of fact, why don't you take what's inside the Ridge Wallet?

02:36.800 --> 02:41.260
It's something really special that I saved just for you.

02:41.260 --> 02:43.040
It's a downward spiral.

02:43.040 --> 02:48.960
Downward spiral, downward spiral, downward spiral, downward spiral, downward spiral.

02:48.960 --> 02:52.320
I turn myself into the physical manifestation of society, Morty.

02:52.320 --> 02:54.320
I'm Joker Rick!

02:54.320 --> 02:56.200
Enough from the clown.

02:56.200 --> 02:57.200
Oh, what's the matter?

02:57.200 --> 03:01.960
Aren't you all excited to hear yet another Emperor Lemon rant about YouTube?

03:01.960 --> 03:03.720
Isn't that why most of you are here?

03:03.720 --> 03:05.540
To listen to me complain?

03:05.540 --> 03:10.080
You see, I can scrub off this makeup until I'm ripping the flesh from my skull, but it

03:10.080 --> 03:13.600
won't make me feel like any less of a clown.

03:13.600 --> 03:16.460
Taking off the makeup isn't treating the problem.

03:16.460 --> 03:19.260
It's treating a symptom of the problem.

03:19.260 --> 03:23.620
You'll never really fix anything until you diagnose the root cause.

03:23.620 --> 03:33.780
YouTube's copyright system is a joke, but who's really laughing?

03:33.780 --> 03:38.140
I'll admit that, throughout this series, my bias has been pretty obvious.

03:38.140 --> 03:43.300
I'm not exactly the biggest fan of copyright law because, frankly, I don't respect it.

03:43.300 --> 03:48.540
I fancy myself a bit of a copyright radical, an attitude forged from years of making YouTube

03:48.540 --> 03:52.780
poops where you learn to treat every piece of media like just another pigment in your

03:52.780 --> 03:53.780
artistic palette.

03:53.780 --> 03:58.600
I figure as long as you're not directly re-uploading the content for free, then what difference

03:58.600 --> 04:02.540
does it make when you use five seconds of a movie scene for a joke?

04:02.540 --> 04:05.880
And that's not to say that copyright law is totally worthless.

04:05.880 --> 04:10.660
There are certainly valid reasons for establishing copyright protection on some types of content.

04:13.740 --> 04:17.700
So when I first released what is now known as the Knife Game song, it gained a lot of

04:17.700 --> 04:22.300
internet attention and became a popular trend where many people would record versions of

04:22.300 --> 04:24.860
themselves singing my original song.

04:24.860 --> 04:28.740
And that was all fine and well, except for the fact that the song was quickly spiraling

04:28.740 --> 04:30.260
out of my control.

04:30.260 --> 04:35.260
Websites like Gawker and Huffington Post were attributing the song's creation to a 16-year-old

04:35.260 --> 04:39.180
Norwegian girl, because it probably made for a better story.

04:39.180 --> 04:43.460
People were using the song freely on TV shows, and basically it was looking like the Knife

04:43.460 --> 04:46.940
Game song was just going to become absorbed into the internet.

04:46.940 --> 04:51.900
The problem was, I was actually trying to sell the song on places like iTunes, so it

04:51.900 --> 04:56.380
became necessary for me to go through the process of copywriting the song, to solidify

04:56.380 --> 04:59.300
my ownership before it was too late.

04:59.300 --> 05:04.420
So now, if shows like Ridiculousness want to use my song in one of their segments, which

05:04.420 --> 05:08.500
they have, they have to contact me to negotiate a price.

05:08.500 --> 05:13.100
Whereas if I'd never gotten official ownership of the song, anyone could profit off it without

05:13.100 --> 05:16.500
me even being recognized as having written it.

05:16.500 --> 05:21.820
Theoretically, copyright should function similarly to the patent system by protecting small creators

05:21.820 --> 05:24.380
from getting run over by the corporate machine.

05:24.380 --> 05:29.040
If you invent a new groundbreaking device, something's got to stop some big company from

05:29.040 --> 05:33.700
just stealing your idea, mass producing it, and reaping all the benefits from your hard

05:33.700 --> 05:34.700
work.

05:34.700 --> 05:39.180
Conversely, when a corporation releases a new product, they get impacted by a much smaller

05:39.180 --> 05:44.260
extent from some dude selling a bootleg version at a flea market.

05:44.260 --> 05:48.660
Corporations can use their immense resources to continue making money regardless of patent

05:48.660 --> 05:49.660
protection.

05:49.660 --> 05:55.020
Ideally, copyright should function in a similar way to patents by protecting small artists,

05:55.020 --> 05:59.300
but as the laws are currently administered, the opposite is true.

05:59.300 --> 06:04.660
Copyright regulation overwhelmingly favors corporations over individuals by an enormous

06:04.660 --> 06:05.660
margin.

06:05.660 --> 06:11.520
Initially, US copyright law granted a 28-year protection period, comparable to the 20 years

06:11.520 --> 06:13.380
granted to patents.

06:13.380 --> 06:18.140
Intellectual property rights were kept relatively short for a reason, to provide artists and

06:18.140 --> 06:22.460
inventors with enough time to effectively market their ideas, but not too much time

06:22.460 --> 06:25.180
for them to complacently rest on their laurels.

06:25.180 --> 06:30.460
A timely expiration is designed to incentivize artists and inventors to continue innovating

06:30.460 --> 06:33.340
and contributing to the welfare of society.

06:33.340 --> 06:39.000
When a patent or copyright expires, the intellectual property transfers to the public domain, meaning

06:39.000 --> 06:44.000
that it's free to use for everyone, thus unlocking even more creative potential.

06:44.000 --> 06:49.380
And while patent protection has remained largely the same, copyright protection has been continually

06:49.380 --> 06:53.500
and arbitrarily extended to the point of absurdity.

06:53.500 --> 06:58.500
Companies like Disney have repeatedly and successfully lobbied Congress to extend copyright

06:58.500 --> 07:03.340
protection all so that their beloved corporate mascot won't fall into the grubby hands of

07:03.340 --> 07:06.240
the public domain.

07:06.240 --> 07:11.280
As a consequence, copyrighted works created today most likely won't be free to use until

07:11.280 --> 07:17.540
over a century from now, and copyrighted works from nearly a century ago are still unusable.

07:17.540 --> 07:22.600
The public domain is essentially frozen in time and will likely continue to be as Congress

07:22.600 --> 07:26.080
continues to indefinitely extend copyright protection.

07:26.080 --> 07:31.040
So instead of characters like Luke Skywalker or songs by the Beatles becoming free for

07:31.040 --> 07:36.800
everyone to use, we have to stick to Humpty Dumpty and Old MacDonald, the exact same crap

07:36.800 --> 07:39.520
people have been using since the 19th century.

07:39.520 --> 07:44.440
I don't exactly see people racing to relive public lynchings, diphtheria, and railroad

07:44.440 --> 07:49.080
spikes, so why is our public domain stuck in this era?

07:49.080 --> 07:55.840
Also companies like Disney can continue clutching at 90 year old cartoons, a company that ironically

07:55.840 --> 08:01.920
became a media empire by animating stories that they adopted from the public domain?

08:01.920 --> 08:04.160
Copyright law is a joke.

08:04.160 --> 08:09.520
Media companies always like to bemoan how pirating songs or movies hurts the artist

08:09.520 --> 08:14.440
when the nasty copyright laws they push have done more to hurt artists than piracy ever

08:14.440 --> 08:15.440
could.

08:15.480 --> 08:21.280
By forming these huge concentrations of intellectual property and locking them behind a never-ending

08:21.280 --> 08:26.880
copyright wall, you are restricting everyone's ability to freely express their creative vision

08:26.880 --> 08:29.040
with contemporary media.

08:29.040 --> 08:32.400
Remember how my video got claimed for a Cypress Hills song?

08:32.400 --> 08:38.120
Well it turns out that entire genres of music like rap and EDM began by remixing and sampling

08:38.120 --> 08:39.960
other copyrighted works.

08:39.960 --> 08:45.360
And the same copyright goons that plague YouTube today went after the hip-hop artists of yesteryear.

08:46.040 --> 08:51.960
In a 1991 court case, a judge ruled that all sampling required pre-approval from the copyright

08:51.960 --> 08:57.080
owner and essentially crippled what was once a fundamental building block of the rap genre

08:57.080 --> 09:01.840
by forcing hip-hop artists to pay licensing fees for all future samples.

09:01.840 --> 09:07.320
You know, back in the days before three companies owned every song in existence, musicians were

09:07.320 --> 09:12.680
mostly free to borrow ideas, co-op styles, and cover each other's songs without too much

09:12.680 --> 09:13.680
issue.

09:13.680 --> 09:18.920
It's understood that adapting older works was a natural part of innovating the medium.

09:18.920 --> 09:23.960
Some of the biggest bands from the 60s and 70s built musical empires off the work of

09:23.960 --> 09:26.840
lesser known artists from the 40s and 50s.

09:26.840 --> 09:32.240
The Beatles truly were fortunate to exist during a time before strict copyright enforcement.

09:32.240 --> 09:36.280
If they came up today, they probably wouldn't have had a career at all because ruthless

09:36.280 --> 09:40.440
corporate giants would have sued the crap out of them before they even got the taste

09:40.440 --> 09:41.600
of fame.

09:41.600 --> 09:45.880
But hey, copyright regulation exists to benefit the artist, am I right?

09:45.880 --> 09:52.360
I'm sure that EMI Warner Music provided fair compensation to Little Richard, Fats Domino,

09:52.360 --> 09:57.200
Chuck Berry, Buddy Holly, Carl Perkins, and all the other artists who made the songs that

09:57.200 --> 10:00.560
essentially composed the Beatles' early discography.

10:00.560 --> 10:05.480
And I'm sure that after the Beatles got rich and successful and made those music companies

10:05.480 --> 10:11.760
a lot of money, future artists had just as easy of a time covering Beatles songs.

10:11.760 --> 10:16.320
Does copyright law only matter when you have the corporate backing to squash the worthless

10:16.320 --> 10:18.000
plebeians beneath you?

10:18.000 --> 10:20.160
Well, yes, of course.

10:20.160 --> 10:25.080
Popular musicians nowadays are obligated to nickel and dime every single riff, melody,

10:25.080 --> 10:29.080
or lyric that even slightly resembles anything they ever made.

10:29.080 --> 10:33.980
So that means no covers of Let It Go from bedroom-dwelling YouTube teenagers and no

10:33.980 --> 10:35.940
sampling for hip-hop artists.

10:35.940 --> 10:38.900
That's how the law works.

10:38.900 --> 10:43.300
And if you don't think that kneecapping an entire musical genre is bad enough, the

10:43.300 --> 10:49.100
same copyright goons would later go on to demand royalties from the Girl Scouts of America

10:49.100 --> 10:53.860
for singing their copyrighted works as campfire songs.

10:53.860 --> 10:58.060
And if that's not enough to convince you of the absolute greed of those in favor of

10:58.060 --> 11:03.700
modern copyright regulation, the copyright goons also pride Happy Birthday to you out

11:03.700 --> 11:09.040
of the public domain and into their checking accounts by demanding royalties from any public

11:09.040 --> 11:10.980
performance of the song.

11:10.980 --> 11:16.440
So just a reminder to all of you out there, if you've ever sang Happy Birthday in Public,

11:16.440 --> 11:22.460
the most recognized song in the English language, then you are a copyright criminal and owe

11:22.460 --> 11:24.540
some company money.

11:24.540 --> 11:30.260
Hopefully that will distract you from the fact that the song is 126 years old.

11:30.260 --> 11:35.260
It was published in 1893.

11:35.260 --> 11:38.260
1893.

11:38.260 --> 11:41.260
1893.

11:41.260 --> 11:53.260
It was published in 1893.

11:53.260 --> 11:55.260
Are you getting any copyright claims?

11:55.260 --> 11:58.260
What don't you understand about?

11:58.260 --> 11:59.260
More!

11:59.260 --> 12:06.260
All I get are copyright claims.

12:06.260 --> 12:10.260
Madness!

12:10.260 --> 12:15.900
I hope you realize now that any industry claims about how modern copyright laws are designed

12:15.900 --> 12:21.580
to help the artist are an absolute crock of shit, and that they actually exist as a battering

12:21.580 --> 12:27.220
ram to extort as much money out of individuals and artists as possible by ruthlessly hoarding

12:27.220 --> 12:32.100
the ancient zombified remains of once profitable entertainment properties.

12:32.100 --> 12:37.060
So you'll have to forgive me when I say that I don't exactly respect copyright laws and

12:37.060 --> 12:51.080
that copyright smuggling doesn't keep me up at night with guilt.

12:51.080 --> 12:56.100
It's easy to hate YouTube for copyright missteps, but they aren't the ones making the laws.

12:56.100 --> 13:01.680
The fact of the matter is that current copyright legislation is simply incompatible with modern-day

13:01.680 --> 13:04.300
peer-to-peer communication on the internet.

13:04.300 --> 13:09.740
The laws by which YouTube are forced to comply were drafted during a time when barely anyone

13:09.740 --> 13:16.460
used the internet by lawmakers who, to this day, probably still don't understand the internet

13:16.460 --> 13:18.100
on a fundamental level.

13:18.100 --> 13:23.700
The role of the internet has changed dramatically since 1998 to where it's almost unrecognizable

13:23.700 --> 13:28.500
today, yet the law governing content sharing hasn't budged.

13:28.500 --> 13:33.420
These stringent copyright laws may have worked 25 years ago when television and newspapers

13:33.420 --> 13:38.580
served as information gatekeepers and people still had to pay to listen to music.

13:38.580 --> 13:42.440
25 years ago, you'd pay $10 for a single CD.

13:42.440 --> 13:48.660
Now you can pay $10 for access to every song ever made, and it's not even illegal.

13:48.660 --> 13:52.700
Music companies have been forced to embrace streaming services because the internet has

13:52.700 --> 13:58.140
quite simply transformed the way we treat information and intellectual property.

13:58.140 --> 14:03.180
Copyright law still reflects the days when cable TV dominated the media landscape.

14:03.180 --> 14:07.680
Back then, media companies were willing to walk on eggshells regarding copyright because

14:07.680 --> 14:12.100
those same companies were willing to spend millions of dollars suing each other.

14:12.100 --> 14:16.340
TV shows have big enough budgets to comfortably afford licensing fees.

14:16.340 --> 14:20.500
They have long enough production cycles to solicit written permission for every piece

14:20.500 --> 14:21.660
of media.

14:21.660 --> 14:27.740
None of these resources are practical or even available for content creators on YouTube.

14:27.740 --> 14:32.420
And this becomes a problem when these big media companies apply the same belligerent,

14:32.420 --> 14:37.460
cutthroat policies to online creators that they're used to using on themselves.

14:37.460 --> 14:41.760
The fact of the matter is that YouTubers have a totally different attitude towards content

14:41.760 --> 14:44.220
creation and content sharing.

14:44.220 --> 14:46.660
YouTube is by and large a cooperative setting.

14:46.660 --> 14:50.700
There's no reason to ruthlessly compete with every channel you encounter because you'd

14:50.740 --> 14:55.060
be much better off collaborating with them instead and sharing your audience.

14:55.060 --> 14:58.300
Whenever I see any of my content in someone else's video,

14:58.300 --> 14:59.300
Downward spiral.

14:59.300 --> 15:02.640
I'm gonna dig straight to hell, genius.

15:02.640 --> 15:04.140
my first reaction isn't,

15:04.140 --> 15:05.140
Yo!

15:05.140 --> 15:08.580
Can we copy strike PewDiePie's latest video?

15:08.580 --> 15:09.580
It's

15:09.580 --> 15:16.100
That's good.

15:16.100 --> 15:20.500
There will come a day when copyright legislation will change to reflect the interests of online

15:20.500 --> 15:23.780
artists, but I don't see it happening anytime soon.

15:23.780 --> 15:28.140
It turns out that copyright reform isn't that high on the public agenda of problems for

15:28.140 --> 15:30.380
our politicians to solve.

15:30.380 --> 15:35.580
Even if it were, I'm sure that the geriatric turbo boomers in Congress would probably side

15:35.580 --> 15:37.340
with corporate interests anyway.

15:37.340 --> 15:42.580
Eventually, the digital cavemen will be outnumbered by younger politicians who pirated a song

15:42.580 --> 15:47.620
off Napster at one time in their lives and copyright law will magically get better.

15:47.740 --> 15:51.940
That's what needs to happen in the future, but what can we do to solve the problem now?

15:51.940 --> 15:57.060
Well, currently, copyright law is so restrictive of the public domain that it has inadvertently

15:57.060 --> 16:00.740
created a black market where everything is public domain.

16:00.740 --> 16:05.580
You can look back through history at countless examples where the war on this or prohibition

16:05.580 --> 16:09.660
of that did nothing to actually prevent what they were trying to prevent.

16:09.660 --> 16:15.740
Authoritarian punishment of natural activities is not only unproductive, but often counterproductive

16:15.740 --> 16:17.940
to the welfare of a society.

16:17.940 --> 16:24.140
On the internet, sharing brief clips of television, movies, and music is a natural activity and

16:24.140 --> 16:28.180
many of these companies don't realize that bludgeoning us over the head with copyright

16:28.180 --> 16:30.860
claims won't stop people from doing that.

16:30.860 --> 16:35.420
YouTubers don't use copyrighted content because they hate media companies and want them to

16:35.420 --> 16:36.540
lose money.

16:36.540 --> 16:41.140
We use copyrighted content because it's the fundamental language of creative expression

16:41.140 --> 16:47.140
on the internet and by impeding that, you're impeding the progression of culture and art.

16:47.140 --> 16:52.060
And what has thus far transpired on YouTube is a cold war of sorts, a battleground between

16:52.060 --> 16:56.940
old and new media where each side is content with silently resisting the other.

16:56.940 --> 17:01.960
In these trying times, YouTube is stuck with the unfortunate task of attempting to reconcile

17:01.960 --> 17:04.820
these vastly different perspectives.

17:04.820 --> 17:09.340
YouTube's copyright system was the first of its kind on such a large-scale site.

17:09.340 --> 17:13.220
It's certainly come a long way, but it still has a long way to go.

17:13.220 --> 17:18.160
First of all, copyright claimants should not be in charge of reviewing appeals and counterclaims

17:18.160 --> 17:21.720
because of how easily this leads to systematic abuse.

17:21.720 --> 17:26.600
If YouTube claims to manually review videos for monetization, then surely they can do

17:26.600 --> 17:28.740
the same for copyright disputes.

17:28.740 --> 17:33.140
I don't care if they outsource it to some Indian mud farmer who's watching YouTube on

17:33.140 --> 17:34.460
a potato.

17:34.460 --> 17:38.480
Anything is more fair than having your appeal controlled by the same people who sent the

17:38.520 --> 17:40.120
claim in the first place.

17:40.120 --> 17:45.880
Second, when a rights holder claims five seconds of a 10-minute video, they should not be entitled

17:45.880 --> 17:49.200
to 100% of the revenue from that video.

17:49.200 --> 17:54.800
It's completely absurd for me to spend over a month on a 43-minute video and not earn

17:54.800 --> 17:59.720
a cent of revenue from it because less than a tenth of a percent of it got copyright claimed

17:59.720 --> 18:01.560
under false pretenses.

18:01.560 --> 18:06.280
A fairer system would be for rights holders to take a share of revenue proportional to

18:06.280 --> 18:08.360
the percentage used in the video.

18:08.360 --> 18:14.020
That way, giant MediaCorp still gets to reap the rewards of TV show funny moments compilations

18:14.020 --> 18:17.520
while more serious YouTubers don't get completely screwed.

18:17.520 --> 18:23.060
And finally, YouTube should implement streamlined tools that allow YouTubers to license copyrighted

18:23.060 --> 18:27.520
content so we don't have to resort to black market tactics.

18:27.520 --> 18:33.480
The entire business of radio is built off running ads between broadcasts of copyrighted

18:33.480 --> 18:34.480
music.

18:34.480 --> 18:38.720
Radio stations pay a flat annual licensing fee and after that they're free to stream

18:38.720 --> 18:40.280
whatever songs they want.

18:40.280 --> 18:45.160
I really don't see how me playing a song as background music is any different from a radio

18:45.160 --> 18:51.000
station doing it and I really don't see why YouTube can't have a similar licensing system.

18:51.000 --> 18:55.800
Existing licensing methods are too slow and expensive to be compatible with the fast-paced

18:55.800 --> 18:57.480
content on YouTube.

18:57.480 --> 19:02.240
It's time to stop nickel and diming every single individual piece of media as if people

19:02.240 --> 19:05.280
still go to the record store to pay for songs.

19:05.280 --> 19:10.040
Music has already adapted to the streaming age and licensing should too.

19:10.040 --> 19:14.360
Both YouTubers and media companies could benefit greatly from such a system.

19:14.360 --> 19:18.100
I'm sure there are plenty of YouTubers who would gladly pay a hundred bucks a year to

19:18.100 --> 19:22.440
guarantee that they can use any song they want without getting copyright claimed.

19:22.440 --> 19:26.060
And even if you don't like that premise, you can't deny that it should at least be an option

19:26.060 --> 19:27.740
for those who do.

19:27.740 --> 19:31.560
This year, YouTube has already shown that they're willing to take steps towards reforming

19:31.560 --> 19:35.960
the copyright system, but they still have a lot of work to do before the system becomes

19:35.960 --> 19:37.600
truly equitable.

19:37.600 --> 19:43.000
Until then, media companies will keep strangling us with claims, YouTubers will keep finding

19:43.000 --> 19:47.860
ways to get around them, and the YouTube copyright metagame will continue.

19:47.860 --> 19:52.120
So I guess at the end of the day, the lesson of this whole series is to just use Rusty

19:52.120 --> 19:56.840
Cage's background music in all your videos because he's too busy stealing slushie machines

19:56.840 --> 20:00.600
and epoxying dead rats to worry about sending you a claim.

20:00.640 --> 20:04.680
Originally, I was going to end this video with Entry of the Gladiators.

20:04.680 --> 20:08.480
You know, the clown theme.

20:08.480 --> 20:12.280
But unfortunately, that song is going to get me copyright claimed.

20:30.600 --> 20:51.480
Well, everyone, that's finally the end of my three part copyright detour.

20:51.480 --> 20:52.720
Hope you guys liked it.

20:52.720 --> 20:57.400
I know that nowadays it's kind of difficult to pay attention to these specific issues,

20:57.400 --> 21:01.800
especially considering YouTube creates a new crisis seemingly every week now.

21:01.800 --> 21:06.320
But copyright is an issue that's really bothered me for basically the entire time I've made

21:06.320 --> 21:11.320
videos on this website, and I'm glad that I finally got a chance to talk about it here.

21:11.320 --> 21:15.620
If you're interested in watching more content regarding copyright issues, I highly recommend

21:15.620 --> 21:20.400
this video by Bedhead Bernie about the more philosophical problems with modern copyright

21:20.400 --> 21:21.620
regulation.

21:21.620 --> 21:22.940
So thanks for watching, everyone.

21:22.940 --> 21:27.340
Be sure to check out that Ridge wallet, and I will catch you in the next one.
