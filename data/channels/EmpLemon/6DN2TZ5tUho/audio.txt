Life is like a hurricane here in Gainesville Gonna get hit by a hurricane, we're gonna
get killed There's no evacuation from this situation
We're fucked here, ooh Hurricane Matthew is gonna shrek us, ooh
The swamp is getting turned into an ocean, oh yeah
Global warming couldn't come faster To accelerate this disaster
Our state is going underwater, ooh Guess we're gonna have to move to Georgia,
ooh Nevermind, I'd rather drown in sewage, ooh
Hurricane Matthew can suck my dick now, fuck you
The only thing that's for sure about inclement Is Hurricane Mega Faggot
SHUT UP!
