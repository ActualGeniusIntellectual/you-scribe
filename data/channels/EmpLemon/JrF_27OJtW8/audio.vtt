00:00.000 --> 00:03.400
You know, I wasn't even gonna make a video about the Logan Paul controversy,

00:03.400 --> 00:10.000
but YouTube's sheer amount of ape-like incompetence in handling the situation just forced my hand.

00:10.000 --> 00:14.400
Now let me preface this rant by saying that this is not a Logan Paul video.

00:14.400 --> 00:18.100
I don't give a shit about the Paul brothers and their wacky hijinks.

00:18.100 --> 00:22.100
And if you keep giving them the attention they want, then you're part of the problem.

00:22.100 --> 00:24.300
This is a video about YouTube.

00:24.300 --> 00:28.300
Oh, mercy me. YouTube, YouTube, YouTube.

00:28.300 --> 00:33.100
How on earth is the number two website on the internet this incompetent?

00:33.100 --> 00:34.200
Nine days.

00:34.200 --> 00:39.600
It took them nine days to respond to the biggest PR disaster they've had since,

00:39.600 --> 00:42.600
well, basically everything that happened last year.

00:42.600 --> 00:47.900
But holy Christ, you'd think that considering everything that happened last year,

00:47.900 --> 00:52.900
YouTube would learn a thing or two about running a company without causing everyone to hate them.

00:52.900 --> 00:56.600
But no, apparently YouTube has learned absolutely nothing

00:56.600 --> 01:01.700
and could not last one day in 2018 without screwing up yet again.

01:01.700 --> 01:05.900
Everyone knows the story already, but for argument's sake, let's review what happened.

01:05.900 --> 01:12.700
So old foot-face Logan Paul broke YouTube's guidelines by uploading footage of an actual corpse.

01:12.700 --> 01:15.500
But since the Paul brothers are YouTube's golden boys,

01:15.500 --> 01:21.500
YouTube chose not to enforce their rules and actually hand-picked the video for their trending page.

01:21.500 --> 01:29.300
They allow this content on trending while simultaneously demonetizing regular users' content at record proportions.

01:29.300 --> 01:34.600
They allow this content on trending just a month after the concerns of child endangerment

01:34.600 --> 01:38.700
forced YouTube to scramble and try and save their image for advertisers.

01:38.700 --> 01:46.200
YouTube kept this video trending while taking down other users' videos pointing out YouTube's unscrupulous hypocrisy.

01:46.300 --> 01:52.800
YouTube allowed this video to stay online for over two days before Logan Paul himself took it down,

01:52.800 --> 01:57.900
only after receiving the biggest backlash against a single YouTuber I've ever witnessed.

01:57.900 --> 02:01.300
Logan Paul was the number one Twitter trend for about a day straight.

02:01.300 --> 02:07.100
Pretty much every big YouTuber from across the board came out expressing how terrible Logan's video was.

02:07.100 --> 02:12.800
The video was picked up by the biggest news outlets and Logan Paul became a global embarrassment.

02:12.800 --> 02:17.400
And YouTube did or said nothing about it for more than a week.

02:17.400 --> 02:21.400
So just when everyone had moved on to Ugandan Knuckles or whatever,

02:21.400 --> 02:23.400
YouTube finally comes out and says,

02:23.400 --> 02:26.200
Oh, okay, guys, y'all are right.

02:26.200 --> 02:30.500
Logan Paul did a bad thing and now we're gonna put him in timeout.

02:30.500 --> 02:32.400
Nine days after it happened.

02:32.400 --> 02:36.800
Now, I don't know if YouTube receives their news by horseback,

02:36.800 --> 02:39.700
but considering they're a website on the internet,

02:39.700 --> 02:46.300
one could infer that YouTube was aware of this situation for an awfully long time before doing anything about it.

02:46.300 --> 02:52.600
Nine days seems like a pretty delayed reaction to a massive scandal threatening the credibility of your entire site.

02:52.600 --> 02:58.000
So how come YouTube had to spend nine days deciding whether or not to discipline a guy

02:58.000 --> 03:01.800
who everyone immediately agreed is a disgrace to the website?

03:01.800 --> 03:03.800
What on earth took them so long?

03:03.800 --> 03:05.700
Well, I'll tell you what took them so long.

03:05.700 --> 03:11.500
YouTube spent more than a week mulling over whether or not to keep Logan Paul as their poster boy.

03:11.500 --> 03:16.100
It's no secret that ever since PewDiePie's little racism controversy from last year,

03:16.100 --> 03:20.800
YouTube has been grooming Jake and Logan Paul as the next faces of YouTube.

03:20.800 --> 03:23.000
They constantly promote their content.

03:23.000 --> 03:26.500
They give each brother a nice shiny YouTube Red series,

03:26.500 --> 03:28.100
they promote the hell out of that,

03:28.100 --> 03:31.500
and they put the Paul brothers front and center in the YouTube Rewind.

03:31.500 --> 03:36.800
It's so obvious that YouTube is playing favorites with these washed-up Disney Channel stars

03:36.800 --> 03:38.900
and trying to make them the face of their brand.

03:38.900 --> 03:41.000
They ignored all the warning signs.

03:41.000 --> 03:46.800
They ignored all the controversy and evidence that the Paul brothers lacked the stability and the maturity

03:46.800 --> 03:49.300
to represent the entire YouTube community.

03:49.300 --> 03:54.200
Stevie Wonder could have seen that the Paul brothers aren't exactly the most professional candidates

03:54.200 --> 03:56.900
to represent the second biggest site on the web.

03:56.900 --> 03:59.900
As a matter of fact, they're kind of idiots.

03:59.900 --> 04:04.700
But nope, YouTube ignored all of that and went ahead with the Paul brothers world tour.

04:04.700 --> 04:05.900
And what do you know?

04:05.900 --> 04:09.400
They acted like idiots and embarrassed the whole platform.

04:09.400 --> 04:13.900
But the problem for YouTube management was that they had spent the past six months

04:13.900 --> 04:16.200
putting all their eggs in the Paul basket.

04:16.200 --> 04:19.900
And then they go ahead and just fail so spectacularly

04:19.900 --> 04:25.300
that they make YouTube's leadership look like a bunch of hapless morons for even putting them in that position.

04:25.300 --> 04:27.300
I mean, how could they not see this coming?

04:27.300 --> 04:34.600
So the Paul brothers' dumbass hijinks forced YouTube to contemplate backtracking the past six months of their marketing

04:34.600 --> 04:39.100
and put them back to square one in finding their new poster child for the site.

04:39.100 --> 04:41.700
I'm guessing that YouTube didn't want to waste all that effort

04:41.700 --> 04:46.100
so they tried to wait it out and hope that the controversy would just blow over.

04:46.100 --> 04:52.000
But too bad for them, the Logan Paul video turned into one of the biggest internet shitstorms in recent history.

04:52.000 --> 04:53.200
Let's be honest here.

04:53.200 --> 04:56.900
This was an unsalvageable situation after day one.

04:56.900 --> 05:01.100
Yet it took YouTube more than a week to even respond to the issue.

05:01.100 --> 05:05.100
And YouTube's actual response just pissed me off so much

05:05.100 --> 05:08.900
that I honestly would have felt better if they had just continued doing nothing.

05:08.900 --> 05:11.700
At least then they could feign a shred of ignorance

05:11.700 --> 05:16.200
rather than forming the startling implication that they spent over a week

05:16.200 --> 05:20.400
contemplating whether or not they should keep this guy as the face of their site.

05:20.400 --> 05:25.700
But no, YouTube finally responds to the biggest public outrage they've faced in recent history

05:25.700 --> 05:28.300
through a whopping five tweets.

05:28.300 --> 05:30.100
So let's take a look at those.

05:30.100 --> 05:34.700
Many of you have been frustrated with our lack of communication recently.

05:34.700 --> 05:36.100
You're right to be.

05:36.100 --> 05:39.100
You deserve to know what's going on.

05:39.100 --> 05:40.600
Yeah, you're right.

05:40.600 --> 05:44.100
I think frustrated is a bit of an understatement at this point.

05:44.100 --> 05:45.600
But way to go, YouTube.

05:45.600 --> 05:51.900
I'm so glad you're finally amending your lack of communication by releasing five entire tweets.

05:51.900 --> 05:55.300
I guess it's too much to ask for you guys to make an actual press release

05:55.300 --> 06:00.300
or a video or anything more than a few sentences that probably took five minutes to write.

06:00.300 --> 06:05.600
But I'm glad you guys care so much about the issue that you're responding to it nine days late

06:05.600 --> 06:08.000
in the form of five tweets.

06:08.000 --> 06:10.100
So let's see what YouTube has to say.

06:10.100 --> 06:15.300
Like many others, we were upset by the video that was shared last week.

06:15.300 --> 06:16.300
Really?

06:16.300 --> 06:18.300
You were upset by the video.

06:18.300 --> 06:20.000
Well, that really clears things up.

06:20.000 --> 06:23.300
For a second there, I thought you guys were gonna be happy with the ass clown

06:23.300 --> 06:25.800
parading a dead body all over your platform.

06:25.800 --> 06:29.300
But it's good to know that the video upset you guys, too.

06:29.300 --> 06:34.800
Suicide is not a joke, nor should it ever be a driving force for views.

06:34.800 --> 06:36.100
Yep, that's right.

06:36.100 --> 06:37.700
Suicide is bad.

06:37.700 --> 06:40.000
Glad you guys cleared that one up for us.

06:40.000 --> 06:42.100
Suicide is in fact bad.

06:42.100 --> 06:43.000
Good.

06:43.000 --> 06:45.100
We're already three out of five tweets in,

06:45.100 --> 06:51.400
and so far YouTube has told us that Logan Paul is upsetting and that suicide is bad.

06:51.400 --> 06:54.200
What a groundbreaking news flash right here.

06:54.200 --> 07:00.600
It took them nine days to figure out that the Logan Paul video is upsetting and that suicide is bad.

07:00.600 --> 07:04.700
I'm so glad YouTube is really giving us the information that we need.

07:04.700 --> 07:07.900
You're really improving your communication here, YouTube.

07:07.900 --> 07:10.600
But wait, that's not even the best part.

07:10.600 --> 07:13.800
The channel violated our community guidelines.

07:13.800 --> 07:18.900
We acted accordingly, and we are looking at further consequences.

07:18.900 --> 07:20.400
Mm-hmm, yep.

07:20.400 --> 07:24.900
Showing a corpse on YouTube does in fact violate the community guidelines.

07:24.900 --> 07:25.900
Let's see here.

07:25.900 --> 07:29.100
YouTube community guidelines and...

07:29.100 --> 07:31.900
Yep, no violent and graphic content.

07:31.900 --> 07:35.700
A hanging suicide victim is pretty violent and graphic.

07:35.700 --> 07:37.100
So that part checks out.

07:37.100 --> 07:41.500
It's good to see that YouTube is aware of their own community guidelines.

07:41.500 --> 07:44.700
In fact, the first half of this tweet is pretty accurate.

07:44.700 --> 07:48.200
But it's the second part of this tweet that...

07:48.200 --> 07:49.800
That's not exactly true.

07:49.800 --> 07:52.000
We acted accordingly?

07:52.000 --> 07:54.600
What? What are you talking about?

07:54.600 --> 07:59.200
What kind of devious, bamboozling revisionist history is this?

07:59.200 --> 08:03.700
Did YouTube wait nine days to respond to their biggest controversy in years

08:03.700 --> 08:09.300
because they thought we'd forget that they did absolutely nothing to enforce their own guidelines?

08:09.300 --> 08:11.300
They acted accordingly?

08:11.300 --> 08:16.700
Is it standard protocol at YouTube to put videos on trending when they violate your guidelines?

08:16.700 --> 08:20.500
Yeah, you certainly took down videos criticizing Logan's video.

08:20.500 --> 08:22.700
Just not Logan's video.

08:22.700 --> 08:27.200
You let that one stay up for as long as you could until Logan took it down.

08:27.200 --> 08:28.100
Wait a minute.

08:28.100 --> 08:34.200
Do we live in a world where Logan Paul is better at enforcing YouTube's community guidelines than YouTube is?

08:34.200 --> 08:36.100
It's a real head scratcher for sure.

08:36.100 --> 08:37.800
I gotta hand it to you, YouTube.

08:37.800 --> 08:43.300
You blatantly lied to your community just three tweets after saying you're gonna improve your communication.

08:43.300 --> 08:44.600
That takes guts.

08:44.700 --> 08:50.700
It's too bad your lie was so obviously untrue that you got called out on it almost immediately.

08:50.700 --> 08:53.200
Just own. Just own the mistake.

08:53.200 --> 08:55.700
Just own the fucking mistake.

08:55.700 --> 08:59.100
I hate defending you because...

08:59.100 --> 09:00.800
Because I'm like, YouTube's trying.

09:00.800 --> 09:01.700
They're good.

09:01.700 --> 09:04.200
And then you get this fucking softball.

09:04.200 --> 09:09.300
You get this softball of a singular, easy-to-handle situation.

09:09.300 --> 09:11.600
And then you're like, we did everything accordingly.

09:11.600 --> 09:14.100
Shut really, God.

09:14.100 --> 09:15.800
You're so stupid.

09:15.800 --> 09:21.100
I guess one good thing that came out of this was that YouTube actually followed through with disciplining Logan.

09:21.100 --> 09:24.900
I thought they were just gonna give him a slap on the wrist and send him to bed without dessert.

09:24.900 --> 09:30.200
But as I was writing this, YouTube actually came out and punished Logan for his actions.

09:30.200 --> 09:35.600
They canceled his YouTube Red movie sequel and removed him from Google Preferred advertising.

09:35.600 --> 09:40.400
Remember last year when PewDiePie messed up and YouTube punished him almost immediately?

09:40.400 --> 09:46.200
Well, how come it took them ten whole days to decide to punish good old FootFace here?

09:46.200 --> 09:50.700
And more importantly, why was Logan Paul granted these privileges in the first place?

09:50.700 --> 09:53.500
I know I talked about this already, but it bears repeating.

09:53.500 --> 09:59.600
Why did YouTube think it was a good idea to tout Logan Paul as the new face of YouTube?

09:59.600 --> 10:03.900
Was YouTube that desperate to find the next 12-year-old viewer magnet

10:03.900 --> 10:08.500
that they mortgaged the stability of their whole site by putting this guy at the helm?

10:08.500 --> 10:13.900
Anyway, YouTube just wraps up their big update with one final middle finger to the community.

10:13.900 --> 10:16.600
It's taken us a long time to respond.

10:16.600 --> 10:19.000
Yep, that's very true, YouTube.

10:19.000 --> 10:20.300
You're right again.

10:20.300 --> 10:24.200
We know the actions of one creator can affect the entire community,

10:24.200 --> 10:31.100
so we'll have more to share soon on the steps we're taking to ensure that a video like this is never circulated again.

10:31.100 --> 10:33.300
Oh, oh, oh, you're taking steps.

10:33.300 --> 10:35.900
Oh goodie, YouTube is taking steps.

10:35.900 --> 10:42.500
Those must be some massive strides you're taking to actually enforce the guidelines that you yourself put in place.

10:42.500 --> 10:45.600
Seriously though, what steps even need to be taken here?

10:45.600 --> 10:48.700
Just enforce your own fucking guidelines, YouTube.

10:48.700 --> 10:50.900
This is all your fault.

10:50.900 --> 10:54.300
You brought all this bad publicity on yourselves.

10:54.300 --> 10:56.100
You put this guy in power,

10:56.100 --> 11:02.200
you let him post a video of a dead body while punishing the rest of us for even saying the word suicide,

11:02.200 --> 11:06.000
just enforce your own rules equally to everyone on the platform.

11:06.000 --> 11:10.300
Stop letting these Google-preferred idiots run around above the rules.

11:10.300 --> 11:14.900
Seriously, just man up and admit that you people fucked up.

11:14.900 --> 11:19.700
Stop with these bullshit wishy-washy politician responses.

11:19.700 --> 11:23.700
The problem here is not Logan retarded fuckface Paul.

11:23.700 --> 11:26.000
The problem is you, YouTube.

11:26.000 --> 11:28.600
The problem is fucking you.

11:28.600 --> 11:31.000
You people have zero accountability.

11:31.000 --> 11:34.700
You let all these unstable jackasses take the reins of your sight

11:34.700 --> 11:38.300
while shafting your honest-to-god hard-working real YouTubers.

11:38.300 --> 11:41.600
Every time something like this happens, it's the same old shit.

11:41.600 --> 11:44.200
YouTube fucks up, people are outraged,

11:44.200 --> 11:49.300
YouTube comes up with some dopey half-assed apology and then everyone just forgets about it

11:49.300 --> 11:52.000
while all the smaller YouTubers have to pick up the slack.

11:52.000 --> 11:57.600
Are you people even aware that Jake Paul also had a fuck-up at the same time as Logan's fuck-up?

11:57.600 --> 11:59.800
YouTube still hasn't done anything to punish Jake.

11:59.800 --> 12:03.600
I'm sure he still has his Google-preferred and YouTube-read series.

12:03.600 --> 12:06.800
Well, that's a good thing for Jake since no one noticed his fuck-up

12:06.800 --> 12:11.000
because it was completely overshadowed by his brother's even bigger fuck-up.

12:11.000 --> 12:15.400
Hey, YouTube, why did you make these two the face of your website again?

12:15.400 --> 12:19.200
Do the people running YouTube even watch YouTube videos?

12:19.200 --> 12:20.400
Honest question here.

12:20.400 --> 12:24.100
How could no one working for YouTube realize that the Paul brothers

12:24.100 --> 12:27.100
weren't fit to be the poster boys of this website?

12:27.100 --> 12:31.700
Were they just too busy jacking themselves off to the analytics of the number of fifth graders

12:31.700 --> 12:33.300
these guys draw to the site?

12:33.300 --> 12:37.300
Whatever the cause, it's another huge fucking oversight

12:37.300 --> 12:42.700
that led to yet another big YouTube blunder that taints the image of the entire site.

12:42.700 --> 12:46.700
If this was just a one-time thing, then maybe you could excuse YouTube.

12:46.700 --> 12:52.500
But what is this, the sixth time YouTube has royally fucked up in the past 18 months?

12:52.500 --> 12:54.600
I've lost fucking count!

12:54.600 --> 13:01.300
It has become painfully clear that the true cancerous tumor that's killing YouTube from the inside

13:01.300 --> 13:04.500
is their managerial and business administration.

13:04.500 --> 13:08.000
At this point, it just seems like YouTube is run by a bunch of 40-year-olds

13:08.000 --> 13:12.600
with business and marketing degrees who have no idea how the internet actually works.

13:12.600 --> 13:18.300
You have all these glad-handing yes-men who have never touched a video camera in their entire lives

13:18.300 --> 13:22.200
in charge of running the biggest video producing platform in the world.

13:22.200 --> 13:25.100
The fates of literally millions of would-be artists

13:25.100 --> 13:30.300
are under the control of about a dozen corporate suits in a boardroom somewhere in California.

13:30.300 --> 13:34.200
And you can chalk up most of this blame to good old Susan Dubya,

13:34.200 --> 13:38.900
the vaunted YouTube CEO who really doesn't seem to do much of anything,

13:38.900 --> 13:42.200
but sit on her ass and smile while this site rots.

13:42.200 --> 13:47.000
Under her tenure, YouTube has undergone by far the worst period in its history.

13:47.000 --> 13:49.800
Since old Dubya took over in 2014,

13:49.800 --> 13:54.100
YouTube has endlessly chased pointless gimmicks and bells and whistles

13:54.100 --> 13:57.200
while ignoring the fundamental flaws of their platform.

13:57.200 --> 14:00.900
They chose to alienate their bread-and-butter core user base

14:00.900 --> 14:05.100
just so they could appeal to as much of the trendy idiot masses as possible

14:05.100 --> 14:07.500
who don't give a shit about the quality of the site.

14:07.500 --> 14:11.600
YouTube has been run so poorly over the past year and a half in particular

14:11.600 --> 14:15.100
that I would not be surprised if anyone in charge there

14:15.100 --> 14:18.600
spends more than five minutes a week watching YouTube videos.

14:18.600 --> 14:23.300
They just have to be completely oblivious to what's actually happening on YouTube

14:23.300 --> 14:25.000
based on the decisions they've made.

14:25.000 --> 14:29.200
Can you imagine if a company like Walmart or McDonald's

14:29.200 --> 14:33.700
fucked up as often and as severely as YouTube does on a regular basis?

14:33.700 --> 14:36.400
They would get slaughtered by their competitors.

14:36.400 --> 14:40.000
But the problem with YouTube is that they hold a de facto monopoly

14:40.000 --> 14:42.200
on user-generated video streaming.

14:42.200 --> 14:43.600
There's nowhere else to go.

14:43.600 --> 14:46.400
YouTube has the money and the advertisers

14:46.400 --> 14:50.100
and until a real competitor appears that offers content creators

14:50.100 --> 14:53.000
a real financial incentive to jump ship,

14:53.000 --> 14:56.700
this site will continue to be run by incompetent people.

14:56.700 --> 14:59.600
YouTube's management doesn't even have to hold themselves

14:59.600 --> 15:02.700
to the same standards of companies like Facebook and Twitter.

15:02.700 --> 15:05.900
At least those companies have to answer to stockholders.

15:05.900 --> 15:07.800
Who does YouTube have to answer to?

15:07.800 --> 15:08.500
No one.

15:08.500 --> 15:11.100
They can run the site straight into the ground

15:11.100 --> 15:14.400
and they'll just be caught by the big old Google safety net.

15:14.400 --> 15:18.300
No one gets fired and everything just continues to get worse and worse

15:18.300 --> 15:21.300
but not bad enough for anyone to actually get fired.

15:21.300 --> 15:24.400
YouTube has no accountability whatsoever.

15:24.400 --> 15:27.300
They barely communicate anything to the community

15:27.300 --> 15:31.100
and when they do it's usually just cryptic bullshit like this

15:31.100 --> 15:35.900
where they try and cover their asses by duct-taping the gaping problems in their site

15:35.900 --> 15:40.300
and they end up creating more questions than answers while solving nothing.

15:40.300 --> 15:42.400
And you want to know what the worst part is?

15:42.400 --> 15:43.800
Everyone buys it.

15:43.800 --> 15:45.300
Way to go YouTube.

15:45.300 --> 15:48.100
You did something that should have been done 10 days ago.

15:48.100 --> 15:50.500
Here's a pat on the back and a gold sticker.

15:50.500 --> 15:51.800
We forgive you.

15:51.800 --> 15:54.700
When are you people gonna get your heads out of your asses

15:54.700 --> 15:56.900
and realize the real problem here?

15:56.900 --> 15:59.000
You chant ding-dong the witch is dead

15:59.000 --> 16:02.600
every time the next jackass YouTuber finally gets his comeuppance

16:02.600 --> 16:04.400
and then you move on to the next witch hunt.

16:04.400 --> 16:09.200
And then six months later you do it all over again and again and again.

16:09.200 --> 16:13.700
It's just an endless cycle because you people are not treating the real problem.

16:13.700 --> 16:15.800
You're treating a symptom of the problem.

16:15.800 --> 16:18.500
Logan Paul was never the problem.

16:18.500 --> 16:21.800
YouTube is the problem here.

16:21.800 --> 16:25.000
So stop focusing on trying to tear down the YouTubers

16:25.000 --> 16:30.500
and start focusing on the site that enables and propagates this toxic behavior.

16:30.500 --> 16:34.600
Stop giving YouTube a free pass just for doing the bare minimum

16:34.600 --> 16:37.200
of what's already common sense to most people.

16:37.200 --> 16:42.000
We need to hold the biggest video streaming site on the web to a higher standard.

16:42.000 --> 16:46.100
If we don't hold YouTube accountable for their problems then no one else will.

16:46.100 --> 16:49.900
And yes, this is me going off on yet another YouTube rant.

16:49.900 --> 16:53.800
Boo-hoo, wow-ass, so sad, complain, complain, just unsubscribe already.

16:53.800 --> 16:54.800
I don't give a shit.

16:54.800 --> 16:59.300
Go watch one of the 10,000 Jake Paul rants if you don't like what you're hearing from me

16:59.300 --> 17:03.400
and then come back to me when YouTube fucks up yet again in two months.

17:03.400 --> 17:04.800
But this video isn't about me.

17:04.800 --> 17:06.700
I don't even like making these videos.

17:06.700 --> 17:09.000
I wish I didn't have to make these videos.

17:09.000 --> 17:13.400
I'd much rather spend my time making actual genuine content that I enjoy.

17:13.400 --> 17:18.200
I'm just a guy who wants to make some videos and entertain some people.

17:18.200 --> 17:22.800
But this is an issue I have to talk about because if I don't nobody else will

17:22.800 --> 17:27.200
and YouTube just makes it that much more necessary for me by being incompetent.

17:27.300 --> 17:30.500
I don't make these YouTube rants for views and attention.

17:30.500 --> 17:32.500
I don't make these rants for me.

17:32.500 --> 17:35.900
I make these rants because I want YouTube to be better.

17:35.900 --> 17:40.900
I make these rants because when I look at this site and see what it's become, it sickens me.

17:40.900 --> 17:46.300
At the end of the day, YouTube is still a good site with tons of upsides.

17:46.300 --> 17:50.200
But the fact that it could be so much better is just sad.

17:50.200 --> 17:54.700
And yes, I know it's difficult to run a massive site like YouTube.

17:54.700 --> 18:01.900
But when we've reached the point where pretty much every decision YouTube makes is hated by the majority of the community.

18:01.900 --> 18:07.000
Maybe it's time to start asking the people running the site to be better.

18:07.000 --> 18:10.600
I'm so sick of all these people making excuses for YouTube.

18:10.600 --> 18:12.300
YouTube is not your friend.

18:12.300 --> 18:15.600
YouTube is not a benevolent mom-and-pop company.

18:15.600 --> 18:22.500
They're part of a multi-billion dollar corporation that has access to any resources it could possibly need.

18:22.500 --> 18:26.800
So I don't want to hear how YouTube is just doing the best they can because they aren't.

18:26.800 --> 18:34.200
The number of problems YouTube creates for itself on a regular basis is inexcusable for a company of its stature.

18:34.200 --> 18:38.100
And the people in charge clearly aren't equipped to run this site.

18:38.100 --> 18:44.100
And until these people are expunged from power, all these problems are just gonna keep happening.

18:44.100 --> 18:52.400
So is it too much to ask for the people running the second biggest site on the web to actually give a shit?

18:52.400 --> 18:53.500
Is it?
