1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,400
You know, I wasn't even gonna make a video about the Logan Paul controversy,

2
00:00:03,400 --> 00:00:10,000
but YouTube's sheer amount of ape-like incompetence in handling the situation just forced my hand.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,400
Now let me preface this rant by saying that this is not a Logan Paul video.

4
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:18,100
I don't give a shit about the Paul brothers and their wacky hijinks.

5
00:00:18,100 --> 00:00:22,100
And if you keep giving them the attention they want, then you're part of the problem.

6
00:00:22,100 --> 00:00:24,300
This is a video about YouTube.

7
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:28,300
Oh, mercy me. YouTube, YouTube, YouTube.

8
00:00:28,300 --> 00:00:33,100
How on earth is the number two website on the internet this incompetent?

9
00:00:33,100 --> 00:00:34,200
Nine days.

10
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:39,600
It took them nine days to respond to the biggest PR disaster they've had since,

11
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:42,600
well, basically everything that happened last year.

12
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:47,900
But holy Christ, you'd think that considering everything that happened last year,

13
00:00:47,900 --> 00:00:52,900
YouTube would learn a thing or two about running a company without causing everyone to hate them.

14
00:00:52,900 --> 00:00:56,600
But no, apparently YouTube has learned absolutely nothing

15
00:00:56,600 --> 00:01:01,700
and could not last one day in 2018 without screwing up yet again.

16
00:01:01,700 --> 00:01:05,900
Everyone knows the story already, but for argument's sake, let's review what happened.

17
00:01:05,900 --> 00:01:12,700
So old foot-face Logan Paul broke YouTube's guidelines by uploading footage of an actual corpse.

18
00:01:12,700 --> 00:01:15,500
But since the Paul brothers are YouTube's golden boys,

19
00:01:15,500 --> 00:01:21,500
YouTube chose not to enforce their rules and actually hand-picked the video for their trending page.

20
00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:29,300
They allow this content on trending while simultaneously demonetizing regular users' content at record proportions.

21
00:01:29,300 --> 00:01:34,600
They allow this content on trending just a month after the concerns of child endangerment

22
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:38,700
forced YouTube to scramble and try and save their image for advertisers.

23
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:46,200
YouTube kept this video trending while taking down other users' videos pointing out YouTube's unscrupulous hypocrisy.

24
00:01:46,300 --> 00:01:52,800
YouTube allowed this video to stay online for over two days before Logan Paul himself took it down,

25
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:57,900
only after receiving the biggest backlash against a single YouTuber I've ever witnessed.

26
00:01:57,900 --> 00:02:01,300
Logan Paul was the number one Twitter trend for about a day straight.

27
00:02:01,300 --> 00:02:07,100
Pretty much every big YouTuber from across the board came out expressing how terrible Logan's video was.

28
00:02:07,100 --> 00:02:12,800
The video was picked up by the biggest news outlets and Logan Paul became a global embarrassment.

29
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:17,400
And YouTube did or said nothing about it for more than a week.

30
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:21,400
So just when everyone had moved on to Ugandan Knuckles or whatever,

31
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:23,400
YouTube finally comes out and says,

32
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:26,200
Oh, okay, guys, y'all are right.

33
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:30,500
Logan Paul did a bad thing and now we're gonna put him in timeout.

34
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:32,400
Nine days after it happened.

35
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:36,800
Now, I don't know if YouTube receives their news by horseback,

36
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:39,700
but considering they're a website on the internet,

37
00:02:39,700 --> 00:02:46,300
one could infer that YouTube was aware of this situation for an awfully long time before doing anything about it.

38
00:02:46,300 --> 00:02:52,600
Nine days seems like a pretty delayed reaction to a massive scandal threatening the credibility of your entire site.

39
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:58,000
So how come YouTube had to spend nine days deciding whether or not to discipline a guy

40
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,800
who everyone immediately agreed is a disgrace to the website?

41
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:03,800
What on earth took them so long?

42
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:05,700
Well, I'll tell you what took them so long.

43
00:03:05,700 --> 00:03:11,500
YouTube spent more than a week mulling over whether or not to keep Logan Paul as their poster boy.

44
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:16,100
It's no secret that ever since PewDiePie's little racism controversy from last year,

45
00:03:16,100 --> 00:03:20,800
YouTube has been grooming Jake and Logan Paul as the next faces of YouTube.

46
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:23,000
They constantly promote their content.

47
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,500
They give each brother a nice shiny YouTube Red series,

48
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:28,100
they promote the hell out of that,

49
00:03:28,100 --> 00:03:31,500
and they put the Paul brothers front and center in the YouTube Rewind.

50
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:36,800
It's so obvious that YouTube is playing favorites with these washed-up Disney Channel stars

51
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:38,900
and trying to make them the face of their brand.

52
00:03:38,900 --> 00:03:41,000
They ignored all the warning signs.

53
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:46,800
They ignored all the controversy and evidence that the Paul brothers lacked the stability and the maturity

54
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:49,300
to represent the entire YouTube community.

55
00:03:49,300 --> 00:03:54,200
Stevie Wonder could have seen that the Paul brothers aren't exactly the most professional candidates

56
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:56,900
to represent the second biggest site on the web.

57
00:03:56,900 --> 00:03:59,900
As a matter of fact, they're kind of idiots.

58
00:03:59,900 --> 00:04:04,700
But nope, YouTube ignored all of that and went ahead with the Paul brothers world tour.

59
00:04:04,700 --> 00:04:05,900
And what do you know?

60
00:04:05,900 --> 00:04:09,400
They acted like idiots and embarrassed the whole platform.

61
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:13,900
But the problem for YouTube management was that they had spent the past six months

62
00:04:13,900 --> 00:04:16,200
putting all their eggs in the Paul basket.

63
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:19,900
And then they go ahead and just fail so spectacularly

64
00:04:19,900 --> 00:04:25,300
that they make YouTube's leadership look like a bunch of hapless morons for even putting them in that position.

65
00:04:25,300 --> 00:04:27,300
I mean, how could they not see this coming?

66
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:34,600
So the Paul brothers' dumbass hijinks forced YouTube to contemplate backtracking the past six months of their marketing

67
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:39,100
and put them back to square one in finding their new poster child for the site.

68
00:04:39,100 --> 00:04:41,700
I'm guessing that YouTube didn't want to waste all that effort

69
00:04:41,700 --> 00:04:46,100
so they tried to wait it out and hope that the controversy would just blow over.

70
00:04:46,100 --> 00:04:52,000
But too bad for them, the Logan Paul video turned into one of the biggest internet shitstorms in recent history.

71
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,200
Let's be honest here.

72
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:56,900
This was an unsalvageable situation after day one.

73
00:04:56,900 --> 00:05:01,100
Yet it took YouTube more than a week to even respond to the issue.

74
00:05:01,100 --> 00:05:05,100
And YouTube's actual response just pissed me off so much

75
00:05:05,100 --> 00:05:08,900
that I honestly would have felt better if they had just continued doing nothing.

76
00:05:08,900 --> 00:05:11,700
At least then they could feign a shred of ignorance

77
00:05:11,700 --> 00:05:16,200
rather than forming the startling implication that they spent over a week

78
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:20,400
contemplating whether or not they should keep this guy as the face of their site.

79
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:25,700
But no, YouTube finally responds to the biggest public outrage they've faced in recent history

80
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:28,300
through a whopping five tweets.

81
00:05:28,300 --> 00:05:30,100
So let's take a look at those.

82
00:05:30,100 --> 00:05:34,700
Many of you have been frustrated with our lack of communication recently.

83
00:05:34,700 --> 00:05:36,100
You're right to be.

84
00:05:36,100 --> 00:05:39,100
You deserve to know what's going on.

85
00:05:39,100 --> 00:05:40,600
Yeah, you're right.

86
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:44,100
I think frustrated is a bit of an understatement at this point.

87
00:05:44,100 --> 00:05:45,600
But way to go, YouTube.

88
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:51,900
I'm so glad you're finally amending your lack of communication by releasing five entire tweets.

89
00:05:51,900 --> 00:05:55,300
I guess it's too much to ask for you guys to make an actual press release

90
00:05:55,300 --> 00:06:00,300
or a video or anything more than a few sentences that probably took five minutes to write.

91
00:06:00,300 --> 00:06:05,600
But I'm glad you guys care so much about the issue that you're responding to it nine days late

92
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:08,000
in the form of five tweets.

93
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,100
So let's see what YouTube has to say.

94
00:06:10,100 --> 00:06:15,300
Like many others, we were upset by the video that was shared last week.

95
00:06:15,300 --> 00:06:16,300
Really?

96
00:06:16,300 --> 00:06:18,300
You were upset by the video.

97
00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:20,000
Well, that really clears things up.

98
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,300
For a second there, I thought you guys were gonna be happy with the ass clown

99
00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:25,800
parading a dead body all over your platform.

100
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:29,300
But it's good to know that the video upset you guys, too.

101
00:06:29,300 --> 00:06:34,800
Suicide is not a joke, nor should it ever be a driving force for views.

102
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:36,100
Yep, that's right.

103
00:06:36,100 --> 00:06:37,700
Suicide is bad.

104
00:06:37,700 --> 00:06:40,000
Glad you guys cleared that one up for us.

105
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,100
Suicide is in fact bad.

106
00:06:42,100 --> 00:06:43,000
Good.

107
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,100
We're already three out of five tweets in,

108
00:06:45,100 --> 00:06:51,400
and so far YouTube has told us that Logan Paul is upsetting and that suicide is bad.

109
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:54,200
What a groundbreaking news flash right here.

110
00:06:54,200 --> 00:07:00,600
It took them nine days to figure out that the Logan Paul video is upsetting and that suicide is bad.

111
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:04,700
I'm so glad YouTube is really giving us the information that we need.

112
00:07:04,700 --> 00:07:07,900
You're really improving your communication here, YouTube.

113
00:07:07,900 --> 00:07:10,600
But wait, that's not even the best part.

114
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:13,800
The channel violated our community guidelines.

115
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:18,900
We acted accordingly, and we are looking at further consequences.

116
00:07:18,900 --> 00:07:20,400
Mm-hmm, yep.

117
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:24,900
Showing a corpse on YouTube does in fact violate the community guidelines.

118
00:07:24,900 --> 00:07:25,900
Let's see here.

119
00:07:25,900 --> 00:07:29,100
YouTube community guidelines and...

120
00:07:29,100 --> 00:07:31,900
Yep, no violent and graphic content.

121
00:07:31,900 --> 00:07:35,700
A hanging suicide victim is pretty violent and graphic.

122
00:07:35,700 --> 00:07:37,100
So that part checks out.

123
00:07:37,100 --> 00:07:41,500
It's good to see that YouTube is aware of their own community guidelines.

124
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:44,700
In fact, the first half of this tweet is pretty accurate.

125
00:07:44,700 --> 00:07:48,200
But it's the second part of this tweet that...

126
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:49,800
That's not exactly true.

127
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:52,000
We acted accordingly?

128
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,600
What? What are you talking about?

129
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:59,200
What kind of devious, bamboozling revisionist history is this?

130
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:03,700
Did YouTube wait nine days to respond to their biggest controversy in years

131
00:08:03,700 --> 00:08:09,300
because they thought we'd forget that they did absolutely nothing to enforce their own guidelines?

132
00:08:09,300 --> 00:08:11,300
They acted accordingly?

133
00:08:11,300 --> 00:08:16,700
Is it standard protocol at YouTube to put videos on trending when they violate your guidelines?

134
00:08:16,700 --> 00:08:20,500
Yeah, you certainly took down videos criticizing Logan's video.

135
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:22,700
Just not Logan's video.

136
00:08:22,700 --> 00:08:27,200
You let that one stay up for as long as you could until Logan took it down.

137
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:28,100
Wait a minute.

138
00:08:28,100 --> 00:08:34,200
Do we live in a world where Logan Paul is better at enforcing YouTube's community guidelines than YouTube is?

139
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:36,100
It's a real head scratcher for sure.

140
00:08:36,100 --> 00:08:37,800
I gotta hand it to you, YouTube.

141
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:43,300
You blatantly lied to your community just three tweets after saying you're gonna improve your communication.

142
00:08:43,300 --> 00:08:44,600
That takes guts.

143
00:08:44,700 --> 00:08:50,700
It's too bad your lie was so obviously untrue that you got called out on it almost immediately.

144
00:08:50,700 --> 00:08:53,200
Just own. Just own the mistake.

145
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:55,700
Just own the fucking mistake.

146
00:08:55,700 --> 00:08:59,100
I hate defending you because...

147
00:08:59,100 --> 00:09:00,800
Because I'm like, YouTube's trying.

148
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:01,700
They're good.

149
00:09:01,700 --> 00:09:04,200
And then you get this fucking softball.

150
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:09,300
You get this softball of a singular, easy-to-handle situation.

151
00:09:09,300 --> 00:09:11,600
And then you're like, we did everything accordingly.

152
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:14,100
Shut really, God.

153
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:15,800
You're so stupid.

154
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:21,100
I guess one good thing that came out of this was that YouTube actually followed through with disciplining Logan.

155
00:09:21,100 --> 00:09:24,900
I thought they were just gonna give him a slap on the wrist and send him to bed without dessert.

156
00:09:24,900 --> 00:09:30,200
But as I was writing this, YouTube actually came out and punished Logan for his actions.

157
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:35,600
They canceled his YouTube Red movie sequel and removed him from Google Preferred advertising.

158
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:40,400
Remember last year when PewDiePie messed up and YouTube punished him almost immediately?

159
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:46,200
Well, how come it took them ten whole days to decide to punish good old FootFace here?

160
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:50,700
And more importantly, why was Logan Paul granted these privileges in the first place?

161
00:09:50,700 --> 00:09:53,500
I know I talked about this already, but it bears repeating.

162
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:59,600
Why did YouTube think it was a good idea to tout Logan Paul as the new face of YouTube?

163
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:03,900
Was YouTube that desperate to find the next 12-year-old viewer magnet

164
00:10:03,900 --> 00:10:08,500
that they mortgaged the stability of their whole site by putting this guy at the helm?

165
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:13,900
Anyway, YouTube just wraps up their big update with one final middle finger to the community.

166
00:10:13,900 --> 00:10:16,600
It's taken us a long time to respond.

167
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:19,000
Yep, that's very true, YouTube.

168
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,300
You're right again.

169
00:10:20,300 --> 00:10:24,200
We know the actions of one creator can affect the entire community,

170
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:31,100
so we'll have more to share soon on the steps we're taking to ensure that a video like this is never circulated again.

171
00:10:31,100 --> 00:10:33,300
Oh, oh, oh, you're taking steps.

172
00:10:33,300 --> 00:10:35,900
Oh goodie, YouTube is taking steps.

173
00:10:35,900 --> 00:10:42,500
Those must be some massive strides you're taking to actually enforce the guidelines that you yourself put in place.

174
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:45,600
Seriously though, what steps even need to be taken here?

175
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:48,700
Just enforce your own fucking guidelines, YouTube.

176
00:10:48,700 --> 00:10:50,900
This is all your fault.

177
00:10:50,900 --> 00:10:54,300
You brought all this bad publicity on yourselves.

178
00:10:54,300 --> 00:10:56,100
You put this guy in power,

179
00:10:56,100 --> 00:11:02,200
you let him post a video of a dead body while punishing the rest of us for even saying the word suicide,

180
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:06,000
just enforce your own rules equally to everyone on the platform.

181
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:10,300
Stop letting these Google-preferred idiots run around above the rules.

182
00:11:10,300 --> 00:11:14,900
Seriously, just man up and admit that you people fucked up.

183
00:11:14,900 --> 00:11:19,700
Stop with these bullshit wishy-washy politician responses.

184
00:11:19,700 --> 00:11:23,700
The problem here is not Logan retarded fuckface Paul.

185
00:11:23,700 --> 00:11:26,000
The problem is you, YouTube.

186
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,600
The problem is fucking you.

187
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:31,000
You people have zero accountability.

188
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:34,700
You let all these unstable jackasses take the reins of your sight

189
00:11:34,700 --> 00:11:38,300
while shafting your honest-to-god hard-working real YouTubers.

190
00:11:38,300 --> 00:11:41,600
Every time something like this happens, it's the same old shit.

191
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:44,200
YouTube fucks up, people are outraged,

192
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:49,300
YouTube comes up with some dopey half-assed apology and then everyone just forgets about it

193
00:11:49,300 --> 00:11:52,000
while all the smaller YouTubers have to pick up the slack.

194
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:57,600
Are you people even aware that Jake Paul also had a fuck-up at the same time as Logan's fuck-up?

195
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:59,800
YouTube still hasn't done anything to punish Jake.

196
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:03,600
I'm sure he still has his Google-preferred and YouTube-read series.

197
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:06,800
Well, that's a good thing for Jake since no one noticed his fuck-up

198
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:11,000
because it was completely overshadowed by his brother's even bigger fuck-up.

199
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:15,400
Hey, YouTube, why did you make these two the face of your website again?

200
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:19,200
Do the people running YouTube even watch YouTube videos?

201
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:20,400
Honest question here.

202
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:24,100
How could no one working for YouTube realize that the Paul brothers

203
00:12:24,100 --> 00:12:27,100
weren't fit to be the poster boys of this website?

204
00:12:27,100 --> 00:12:31,700
Were they just too busy jacking themselves off to the analytics of the number of fifth graders

205
00:12:31,700 --> 00:12:33,300
these guys draw to the site?

206
00:12:33,300 --> 00:12:37,300
Whatever the cause, it's another huge fucking oversight

207
00:12:37,300 --> 00:12:42,700
that led to yet another big YouTube blunder that taints the image of the entire site.

208
00:12:42,700 --> 00:12:46,700
If this was just a one-time thing, then maybe you could excuse YouTube.

209
00:12:46,700 --> 00:12:52,500
But what is this, the sixth time YouTube has royally fucked up in the past 18 months?

210
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:54,600
I've lost fucking count!

211
00:12:54,600 --> 00:13:01,300
It has become painfully clear that the true cancerous tumor that's killing YouTube from the inside

212
00:13:01,300 --> 00:13:04,500
is their managerial and business administration.

213
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:08,000
At this point, it just seems like YouTube is run by a bunch of 40-year-olds

214
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:12,600
with business and marketing degrees who have no idea how the internet actually works.

215
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:18,300
You have all these glad-handing yes-men who have never touched a video camera in their entire lives

216
00:13:18,300 --> 00:13:22,200
in charge of running the biggest video producing platform in the world.

217
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:25,100
The fates of literally millions of would-be artists

218
00:13:25,100 --> 00:13:30,300
are under the control of about a dozen corporate suits in a boardroom somewhere in California.

219
00:13:30,300 --> 00:13:34,200
And you can chalk up most of this blame to good old Susan Dubya,

220
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:38,900
the vaunted YouTube CEO who really doesn't seem to do much of anything,

221
00:13:38,900 --> 00:13:42,200
but sit on her ass and smile while this site rots.

222
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:47,000
Under her tenure, YouTube has undergone by far the worst period in its history.

223
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,800
Since old Dubya took over in 2014,

224
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:54,100
YouTube has endlessly chased pointless gimmicks and bells and whistles

225
00:13:54,100 --> 00:13:57,200
while ignoring the fundamental flaws of their platform.

226
00:13:57,200 --> 00:14:00,900
They chose to alienate their bread-and-butter core user base

227
00:14:00,900 --> 00:14:05,100
just so they could appeal to as much of the trendy idiot masses as possible

228
00:14:05,100 --> 00:14:07,500
who don't give a shit about the quality of the site.

229
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:11,600
YouTube has been run so poorly over the past year and a half in particular

230
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:15,100
that I would not be surprised if anyone in charge there

231
00:14:15,100 --> 00:14:18,600
spends more than five minutes a week watching YouTube videos.

232
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:23,300
They just have to be completely oblivious to what's actually happening on YouTube

233
00:14:23,300 --> 00:14:25,000
based on the decisions they've made.

234
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:29,200
Can you imagine if a company like Walmart or McDonald's

235
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:33,700
fucked up as often and as severely as YouTube does on a regular basis?

236
00:14:33,700 --> 00:14:36,400
They would get slaughtered by their competitors.

237
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:40,000
But the problem with YouTube is that they hold a de facto monopoly

238
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,200
on user-generated video streaming.

239
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:43,600
There's nowhere else to go.

240
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:46,400
YouTube has the money and the advertisers

241
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:50,100
and until a real competitor appears that offers content creators

242
00:14:50,100 --> 00:14:53,000
a real financial incentive to jump ship,

243
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:56,700
this site will continue to be run by incompetent people.

244
00:14:56,700 --> 00:14:59,600
YouTube's management doesn't even have to hold themselves

245
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:02,700
to the same standards of companies like Facebook and Twitter.

246
00:15:02,700 --> 00:15:05,900
At least those companies have to answer to stockholders.

247
00:15:05,900 --> 00:15:07,800
Who does YouTube have to answer to?

248
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:08,500
No one.

249
00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:11,100
They can run the site straight into the ground

250
00:15:11,100 --> 00:15:14,400
and they'll just be caught by the big old Google safety net.

251
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:18,300
No one gets fired and everything just continues to get worse and worse

252
00:15:18,300 --> 00:15:21,300
but not bad enough for anyone to actually get fired.

253
00:15:21,300 --> 00:15:24,400
YouTube has no accountability whatsoever.

254
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:27,300
They barely communicate anything to the community

255
00:15:27,300 --> 00:15:31,100
and when they do it's usually just cryptic bullshit like this

256
00:15:31,100 --> 00:15:35,900
where they try and cover their asses by duct-taping the gaping problems in their site

257
00:15:35,900 --> 00:15:40,300
and they end up creating more questions than answers while solving nothing.

258
00:15:40,300 --> 00:15:42,400
And you want to know what the worst part is?

259
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:43,800
Everyone buys it.

260
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:45,300
Way to go YouTube.

261
00:15:45,300 --> 00:15:48,100
You did something that should have been done 10 days ago.

262
00:15:48,100 --> 00:15:50,500
Here's a pat on the back and a gold sticker.

263
00:15:50,500 --> 00:15:51,800
We forgive you.

264
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:54,700
When are you people gonna get your heads out of your asses

265
00:15:54,700 --> 00:15:56,900
and realize the real problem here?

266
00:15:56,900 --> 00:15:59,000
You chant ding-dong the witch is dead

267
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:02,600
every time the next jackass YouTuber finally gets his comeuppance

268
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:04,400
and then you move on to the next witch hunt.

269
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:09,200
And then six months later you do it all over again and again and again.

270
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:13,700
It's just an endless cycle because you people are not treating the real problem.

271
00:16:13,700 --> 00:16:15,800
You're treating a symptom of the problem.

272
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:18,500
Logan Paul was never the problem.

273
00:16:18,500 --> 00:16:21,800
YouTube is the problem here.

274
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:25,000
So stop focusing on trying to tear down the YouTubers

275
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:30,500
and start focusing on the site that enables and propagates this toxic behavior.

276
00:16:30,500 --> 00:16:34,600
Stop giving YouTube a free pass just for doing the bare minimum

277
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:37,200
of what's already common sense to most people.

278
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:42,000
We need to hold the biggest video streaming site on the web to a higher standard.

279
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:46,100
If we don't hold YouTube accountable for their problems then no one else will.

280
00:16:46,100 --> 00:16:49,900
And yes, this is me going off on yet another YouTube rant.

281
00:16:49,900 --> 00:16:53,800
Boo-hoo, wow-ass, so sad, complain, complain, just unsubscribe already.

282
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:54,800
I don't give a shit.

283
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:59,300
Go watch one of the 10,000 Jake Paul rants if you don't like what you're hearing from me

284
00:16:59,300 --> 00:17:03,400
and then come back to me when YouTube fucks up yet again in two months.

285
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:04,800
But this video isn't about me.

286
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:06,700
I don't even like making these videos.

287
00:17:06,700 --> 00:17:09,000
I wish I didn't have to make these videos.

288
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:13,400
I'd much rather spend my time making actual genuine content that I enjoy.

289
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:18,200
I'm just a guy who wants to make some videos and entertain some people.

290
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:22,800
But this is an issue I have to talk about because if I don't nobody else will

291
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:27,200
and YouTube just makes it that much more necessary for me by being incompetent.

292
00:17:27,300 --> 00:17:30,500
I don't make these YouTube rants for views and attention.

293
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:32,500
I don't make these rants for me.

294
00:17:32,500 --> 00:17:35,900
I make these rants because I want YouTube to be better.

295
00:17:35,900 --> 00:17:40,900
I make these rants because when I look at this site and see what it's become, it sickens me.

296
00:17:40,900 --> 00:17:46,300
At the end of the day, YouTube is still a good site with tons of upsides.

297
00:17:46,300 --> 00:17:50,200
But the fact that it could be so much better is just sad.

298
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:54,700
And yes, I know it's difficult to run a massive site like YouTube.

299
00:17:54,700 --> 00:18:01,900
But when we've reached the point where pretty much every decision YouTube makes is hated by the majority of the community.

300
00:18:01,900 --> 00:18:07,000
Maybe it's time to start asking the people running the site to be better.

301
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:10,600
I'm so sick of all these people making excuses for YouTube.

302
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:12,300
YouTube is not your friend.

303
00:18:12,300 --> 00:18:15,600
YouTube is not a benevolent mom-and-pop company.

304
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:22,500
They're part of a multi-billion dollar corporation that has access to any resources it could possibly need.

305
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:26,800
So I don't want to hear how YouTube is just doing the best they can because they aren't.

306
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:34,200
The number of problems YouTube creates for itself on a regular basis is inexcusable for a company of its stature.

307
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:38,100
And the people in charge clearly aren't equipped to run this site.

308
00:18:38,100 --> 00:18:44,100
And until these people are expunged from power, all these problems are just gonna keep happening.

309
00:18:44,100 --> 00:18:52,400
So is it too much to ask for the people running the second biggest site on the web to actually give a shit?

310
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:53,500
Is it?
