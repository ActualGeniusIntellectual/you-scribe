0	3400	You know, I wasn't even gonna make a video about the Logan Paul controversy,
3400	10000	but YouTube's sheer amount of ape-like incompetence in handling the situation just forced my hand.
10000	14400	Now let me preface this rant by saying that this is not a Logan Paul video.
14400	18100	I don't give a shit about the Paul brothers and their wacky hijinks.
18100	22100	And if you keep giving them the attention they want, then you're part of the problem.
22100	24300	This is a video about YouTube.
24300	28300	Oh, mercy me. YouTube, YouTube, YouTube.
28300	33100	How on earth is the number two website on the internet this incompetent?
33100	34200	Nine days.
34200	39600	It took them nine days to respond to the biggest PR disaster they've had since,
39600	42600	well, basically everything that happened last year.
42600	47900	But holy Christ, you'd think that considering everything that happened last year,
47900	52900	YouTube would learn a thing or two about running a company without causing everyone to hate them.
52900	56600	But no, apparently YouTube has learned absolutely nothing
56600	61700	and could not last one day in 2018 without screwing up yet again.
61700	65900	Everyone knows the story already, but for argument's sake, let's review what happened.
65900	72700	So old foot-face Logan Paul broke YouTube's guidelines by uploading footage of an actual corpse.
72700	75500	But since the Paul brothers are YouTube's golden boys,
75500	81500	YouTube chose not to enforce their rules and actually hand-picked the video for their trending page.
81500	89300	They allow this content on trending while simultaneously demonetizing regular users' content at record proportions.
89300	94600	They allow this content on trending just a month after the concerns of child endangerment
94600	98700	forced YouTube to scramble and try and save their image for advertisers.
98700	106200	YouTube kept this video trending while taking down other users' videos pointing out YouTube's unscrupulous hypocrisy.
106300	112800	YouTube allowed this video to stay online for over two days before Logan Paul himself took it down,
112800	117900	only after receiving the biggest backlash against a single YouTuber I've ever witnessed.
117900	121300	Logan Paul was the number one Twitter trend for about a day straight.
121300	127100	Pretty much every big YouTuber from across the board came out expressing how terrible Logan's video was.
127100	132800	The video was picked up by the biggest news outlets and Logan Paul became a global embarrassment.
132800	137400	And YouTube did or said nothing about it for more than a week.
137400	141400	So just when everyone had moved on to Ugandan Knuckles or whatever,
141400	143400	YouTube finally comes out and says,
143400	146200	Oh, okay, guys, y'all are right.
146200	150500	Logan Paul did a bad thing and now we're gonna put him in timeout.
150500	152400	Nine days after it happened.
152400	156800	Now, I don't know if YouTube receives their news by horseback,
156800	159700	but considering they're a website on the internet,
159700	166300	one could infer that YouTube was aware of this situation for an awfully long time before doing anything about it.
166300	172600	Nine days seems like a pretty delayed reaction to a massive scandal threatening the credibility of your entire site.
172600	178000	So how come YouTube had to spend nine days deciding whether or not to discipline a guy
178000	181800	who everyone immediately agreed is a disgrace to the website?
181800	183800	What on earth took them so long?
183800	185700	Well, I'll tell you what took them so long.
185700	191500	YouTube spent more than a week mulling over whether or not to keep Logan Paul as their poster boy.
191500	196100	It's no secret that ever since PewDiePie's little racism controversy from last year,
196100	200800	YouTube has been grooming Jake and Logan Paul as the next faces of YouTube.
200800	203000	They constantly promote their content.
203000	206500	They give each brother a nice shiny YouTube Red series,
206500	208100	they promote the hell out of that,
208100	211500	and they put the Paul brothers front and center in the YouTube Rewind.
211500	216800	It's so obvious that YouTube is playing favorites with these washed-up Disney Channel stars
216800	218900	and trying to make them the face of their brand.
218900	221000	They ignored all the warning signs.
221000	226800	They ignored all the controversy and evidence that the Paul brothers lacked the stability and the maturity
226800	229300	to represent the entire YouTube community.
229300	234200	Stevie Wonder could have seen that the Paul brothers aren't exactly the most professional candidates
234200	236900	to represent the second biggest site on the web.
236900	239900	As a matter of fact, they're kind of idiots.
239900	244700	But nope, YouTube ignored all of that and went ahead with the Paul brothers world tour.
244700	245900	And what do you know?
245900	249400	They acted like idiots and embarrassed the whole platform.
249400	253900	But the problem for YouTube management was that they had spent the past six months
253900	256200	putting all their eggs in the Paul basket.
256200	259900	And then they go ahead and just fail so spectacularly
259900	265300	that they make YouTube's leadership look like a bunch of hapless morons for even putting them in that position.
265300	267300	I mean, how could they not see this coming?
267300	274600	So the Paul brothers' dumbass hijinks forced YouTube to contemplate backtracking the past six months of their marketing
274600	279100	and put them back to square one in finding their new poster child for the site.
279100	281700	I'm guessing that YouTube didn't want to waste all that effort
281700	286100	so they tried to wait it out and hope that the controversy would just blow over.
286100	292000	But too bad for them, the Logan Paul video turned into one of the biggest internet shitstorms in recent history.
292000	293200	Let's be honest here.
293200	296900	This was an unsalvageable situation after day one.
296900	301100	Yet it took YouTube more than a week to even respond to the issue.
301100	305100	And YouTube's actual response just pissed me off so much
305100	308900	that I honestly would have felt better if they had just continued doing nothing.
308900	311700	At least then they could feign a shred of ignorance
311700	316200	rather than forming the startling implication that they spent over a week
316200	320400	contemplating whether or not they should keep this guy as the face of their site.
320400	325700	But no, YouTube finally responds to the biggest public outrage they've faced in recent history
325700	328300	through a whopping five tweets.
328300	330100	So let's take a look at those.
330100	334700	Many of you have been frustrated with our lack of communication recently.
334700	336100	You're right to be.
336100	339100	You deserve to know what's going on.
339100	340600	Yeah, you're right.
340600	344100	I think frustrated is a bit of an understatement at this point.
344100	345600	But way to go, YouTube.
345600	351900	I'm so glad you're finally amending your lack of communication by releasing five entire tweets.
351900	355300	I guess it's too much to ask for you guys to make an actual press release
355300	360300	or a video or anything more than a few sentences that probably took five minutes to write.
360300	365600	But I'm glad you guys care so much about the issue that you're responding to it nine days late
365600	368000	in the form of five tweets.
368000	370100	So let's see what YouTube has to say.
370100	375300	Like many others, we were upset by the video that was shared last week.
375300	376300	Really?
376300	378300	You were upset by the video.
378300	380000	Well, that really clears things up.
380000	383300	For a second there, I thought you guys were gonna be happy with the ass clown
383300	385800	parading a dead body all over your platform.
385800	389300	But it's good to know that the video upset you guys, too.
389300	394800	Suicide is not a joke, nor should it ever be a driving force for views.
394800	396100	Yep, that's right.
396100	397700	Suicide is bad.
397700	400000	Glad you guys cleared that one up for us.
400000	402100	Suicide is in fact bad.
402100	403000	Good.
403000	405100	We're already three out of five tweets in,
405100	411400	and so far YouTube has told us that Logan Paul is upsetting and that suicide is bad.
411400	414200	What a groundbreaking news flash right here.
414200	420600	It took them nine days to figure out that the Logan Paul video is upsetting and that suicide is bad.
420600	424700	I'm so glad YouTube is really giving us the information that we need.
424700	427900	You're really improving your communication here, YouTube.
427900	430600	But wait, that's not even the best part.
430600	433800	The channel violated our community guidelines.
433800	438900	We acted accordingly, and we are looking at further consequences.
438900	440400	Mm-hmm, yep.
440400	444900	Showing a corpse on YouTube does in fact violate the community guidelines.
444900	445900	Let's see here.
445900	449100	YouTube community guidelines and...
449100	451900	Yep, no violent and graphic content.
451900	455700	A hanging suicide victim is pretty violent and graphic.
455700	457100	So that part checks out.
457100	461500	It's good to see that YouTube is aware of their own community guidelines.
461500	464700	In fact, the first half of this tweet is pretty accurate.
464700	468200	But it's the second part of this tweet that...
468200	469800	That's not exactly true.
469800	472000	We acted accordingly?
472000	474600	What? What are you talking about?
474600	479200	What kind of devious, bamboozling revisionist history is this?
479200	483700	Did YouTube wait nine days to respond to their biggest controversy in years
483700	489300	because they thought we'd forget that they did absolutely nothing to enforce their own guidelines?
489300	491300	They acted accordingly?
491300	496700	Is it standard protocol at YouTube to put videos on trending when they violate your guidelines?
496700	500500	Yeah, you certainly took down videos criticizing Logan's video.
500500	502700	Just not Logan's video.
502700	507200	You let that one stay up for as long as you could until Logan took it down.
507200	508100	Wait a minute.
508100	514200	Do we live in a world where Logan Paul is better at enforcing YouTube's community guidelines than YouTube is?
514200	516100	It's a real head scratcher for sure.
516100	517800	I gotta hand it to you, YouTube.
517800	523300	You blatantly lied to your community just three tweets after saying you're gonna improve your communication.
523300	524600	That takes guts.
524700	530700	It's too bad your lie was so obviously untrue that you got called out on it almost immediately.
530700	533200	Just own. Just own the mistake.
533200	535700	Just own the fucking mistake.
535700	539100	I hate defending you because...
539100	540800	Because I'm like, YouTube's trying.
540800	541700	They're good.
541700	544200	And then you get this fucking softball.
544200	549300	You get this softball of a singular, easy-to-handle situation.
549300	551600	And then you're like, we did everything accordingly.
551600	554100	Shut really, God.
554100	555800	You're so stupid.
555800	561100	I guess one good thing that came out of this was that YouTube actually followed through with disciplining Logan.
561100	564900	I thought they were just gonna give him a slap on the wrist and send him to bed without dessert.
564900	570200	But as I was writing this, YouTube actually came out and punished Logan for his actions.
570200	575600	They canceled his YouTube Red movie sequel and removed him from Google Preferred advertising.
575600	580400	Remember last year when PewDiePie messed up and YouTube punished him almost immediately?
580400	586200	Well, how come it took them ten whole days to decide to punish good old FootFace here?
586200	590700	And more importantly, why was Logan Paul granted these privileges in the first place?
590700	593500	I know I talked about this already, but it bears repeating.
593500	599600	Why did YouTube think it was a good idea to tout Logan Paul as the new face of YouTube?
599600	603900	Was YouTube that desperate to find the next 12-year-old viewer magnet
603900	608500	that they mortgaged the stability of their whole site by putting this guy at the helm?
608500	613900	Anyway, YouTube just wraps up their big update with one final middle finger to the community.
613900	616600	It's taken us a long time to respond.
616600	619000	Yep, that's very true, YouTube.
619000	620300	You're right again.
620300	624200	We know the actions of one creator can affect the entire community,
624200	631100	so we'll have more to share soon on the steps we're taking to ensure that a video like this is never circulated again.
631100	633300	Oh, oh, oh, you're taking steps.
633300	635900	Oh goodie, YouTube is taking steps.
635900	642500	Those must be some massive strides you're taking to actually enforce the guidelines that you yourself put in place.
642500	645600	Seriously though, what steps even need to be taken here?
645600	648700	Just enforce your own fucking guidelines, YouTube.
648700	650900	This is all your fault.
650900	654300	You brought all this bad publicity on yourselves.
654300	656100	You put this guy in power,
656100	662200	you let him post a video of a dead body while punishing the rest of us for even saying the word suicide,
662200	666000	just enforce your own rules equally to everyone on the platform.
666000	670300	Stop letting these Google-preferred idiots run around above the rules.
670300	674900	Seriously, just man up and admit that you people fucked up.
674900	679700	Stop with these bullshit wishy-washy politician responses.
679700	683700	The problem here is not Logan retarded fuckface Paul.
683700	686000	The problem is you, YouTube.
686000	688600	The problem is fucking you.
688600	691000	You people have zero accountability.
691000	694700	You let all these unstable jackasses take the reins of your sight
694700	698300	while shafting your honest-to-god hard-working real YouTubers.
698300	701600	Every time something like this happens, it's the same old shit.
701600	704200	YouTube fucks up, people are outraged,
704200	709300	YouTube comes up with some dopey half-assed apology and then everyone just forgets about it
709300	712000	while all the smaller YouTubers have to pick up the slack.
712000	717600	Are you people even aware that Jake Paul also had a fuck-up at the same time as Logan's fuck-up?
717600	719800	YouTube still hasn't done anything to punish Jake.
719800	723600	I'm sure he still has his Google-preferred and YouTube-read series.
723600	726800	Well, that's a good thing for Jake since no one noticed his fuck-up
726800	731000	because it was completely overshadowed by his brother's even bigger fuck-up.
731000	735400	Hey, YouTube, why did you make these two the face of your website again?
735400	739200	Do the people running YouTube even watch YouTube videos?
739200	740400	Honest question here.
740400	744100	How could no one working for YouTube realize that the Paul brothers
744100	747100	weren't fit to be the poster boys of this website?
747100	751700	Were they just too busy jacking themselves off to the analytics of the number of fifth graders
751700	753300	these guys draw to the site?
753300	757300	Whatever the cause, it's another huge fucking oversight
757300	762700	that led to yet another big YouTube blunder that taints the image of the entire site.
762700	766700	If this was just a one-time thing, then maybe you could excuse YouTube.
766700	772500	But what is this, the sixth time YouTube has royally fucked up in the past 18 months?
772500	774600	I've lost fucking count!
774600	781300	It has become painfully clear that the true cancerous tumor that's killing YouTube from the inside
781300	784500	is their managerial and business administration.
784500	788000	At this point, it just seems like YouTube is run by a bunch of 40-year-olds
788000	792600	with business and marketing degrees who have no idea how the internet actually works.
792600	798300	You have all these glad-handing yes-men who have never touched a video camera in their entire lives
798300	802200	in charge of running the biggest video producing platform in the world.
802200	805100	The fates of literally millions of would-be artists
805100	810300	are under the control of about a dozen corporate suits in a boardroom somewhere in California.
810300	814200	And you can chalk up most of this blame to good old Susan Dubya,
814200	818900	the vaunted YouTube CEO who really doesn't seem to do much of anything,
818900	822200	but sit on her ass and smile while this site rots.
822200	827000	Under her tenure, YouTube has undergone by far the worst period in its history.
827000	829800	Since old Dubya took over in 2014,
829800	834100	YouTube has endlessly chased pointless gimmicks and bells and whistles
834100	837200	while ignoring the fundamental flaws of their platform.
837200	840900	They chose to alienate their bread-and-butter core user base
840900	845100	just so they could appeal to as much of the trendy idiot masses as possible
845100	847500	who don't give a shit about the quality of the site.
847500	851600	YouTube has been run so poorly over the past year and a half in particular
851600	855100	that I would not be surprised if anyone in charge there
855100	858600	spends more than five minutes a week watching YouTube videos.
858600	863300	They just have to be completely oblivious to what's actually happening on YouTube
863300	865000	based on the decisions they've made.
865000	869200	Can you imagine if a company like Walmart or McDonald's
869200	873700	fucked up as often and as severely as YouTube does on a regular basis?
873700	876400	They would get slaughtered by their competitors.
876400	880000	But the problem with YouTube is that they hold a de facto monopoly
880000	882200	on user-generated video streaming.
882200	883600	There's nowhere else to go.
883600	886400	YouTube has the money and the advertisers
886400	890100	and until a real competitor appears that offers content creators
890100	893000	a real financial incentive to jump ship,
893000	896700	this site will continue to be run by incompetent people.
896700	899600	YouTube's management doesn't even have to hold themselves
899600	902700	to the same standards of companies like Facebook and Twitter.
902700	905900	At least those companies have to answer to stockholders.
905900	907800	Who does YouTube have to answer to?
907800	908500	No one.
908500	911100	They can run the site straight into the ground
911100	914400	and they'll just be caught by the big old Google safety net.
914400	918300	No one gets fired and everything just continues to get worse and worse
918300	921300	but not bad enough for anyone to actually get fired.
921300	924400	YouTube has no accountability whatsoever.
924400	927300	They barely communicate anything to the community
927300	931100	and when they do it's usually just cryptic bullshit like this
931100	935900	where they try and cover their asses by duct-taping the gaping problems in their site
935900	940300	and they end up creating more questions than answers while solving nothing.
940300	942400	And you want to know what the worst part is?
942400	943800	Everyone buys it.
943800	945300	Way to go YouTube.
945300	948100	You did something that should have been done 10 days ago.
948100	950500	Here's a pat on the back and a gold sticker.
950500	951800	We forgive you.
951800	954700	When are you people gonna get your heads out of your asses
954700	956900	and realize the real problem here?
956900	959000	You chant ding-dong the witch is dead
959000	962600	every time the next jackass YouTuber finally gets his comeuppance
962600	964400	and then you move on to the next witch hunt.
964400	969200	And then six months later you do it all over again and again and again.
969200	973700	It's just an endless cycle because you people are not treating the real problem.
973700	975800	You're treating a symptom of the problem.
975800	978500	Logan Paul was never the problem.
978500	981800	YouTube is the problem here.
981800	985000	So stop focusing on trying to tear down the YouTubers
985000	990500	and start focusing on the site that enables and propagates this toxic behavior.
990500	994600	Stop giving YouTube a free pass just for doing the bare minimum
994600	997200	of what's already common sense to most people.
997200	1002000	We need to hold the biggest video streaming site on the web to a higher standard.
1002000	1006100	If we don't hold YouTube accountable for their problems then no one else will.
1006100	1009900	And yes, this is me going off on yet another YouTube rant.
1009900	1013800	Boo-hoo, wow-ass, so sad, complain, complain, just unsubscribe already.
1013800	1014800	I don't give a shit.
1014800	1019300	Go watch one of the 10,000 Jake Paul rants if you don't like what you're hearing from me
1019300	1023400	and then come back to me when YouTube fucks up yet again in two months.
1023400	1024800	But this video isn't about me.
1024800	1026700	I don't even like making these videos.
1026700	1029000	I wish I didn't have to make these videos.
1029000	1033400	I'd much rather spend my time making actual genuine content that I enjoy.
1033400	1038200	I'm just a guy who wants to make some videos and entertain some people.
1038200	1042800	But this is an issue I have to talk about because if I don't nobody else will
1042800	1047200	and YouTube just makes it that much more necessary for me by being incompetent.
1047300	1050500	I don't make these YouTube rants for views and attention.
1050500	1052500	I don't make these rants for me.
1052500	1055900	I make these rants because I want YouTube to be better.
1055900	1060900	I make these rants because when I look at this site and see what it's become, it sickens me.
1060900	1066300	At the end of the day, YouTube is still a good site with tons of upsides.
1066300	1070200	But the fact that it could be so much better is just sad.
1070200	1074700	And yes, I know it's difficult to run a massive site like YouTube.
1074700	1081900	But when we've reached the point where pretty much every decision YouTube makes is hated by the majority of the community.
1081900	1087000	Maybe it's time to start asking the people running the site to be better.
1087000	1090600	I'm so sick of all these people making excuses for YouTube.
1090600	1092300	YouTube is not your friend.
1092300	1095600	YouTube is not a benevolent mom-and-pop company.
1095600	1102500	They're part of a multi-billion dollar corporation that has access to any resources it could possibly need.
1102500	1106800	So I don't want to hear how YouTube is just doing the best they can because they aren't.
1106800	1114200	The number of problems YouTube creates for itself on a regular basis is inexcusable for a company of its stature.
1114200	1118100	And the people in charge clearly aren't equipped to run this site.
1118100	1124100	And until these people are expunged from power, all these problems are just gonna keep happening.
1124100	1132400	So is it too much to ask for the people running the second biggest site on the web to actually give a shit?
1132400	1133500	Is it?
