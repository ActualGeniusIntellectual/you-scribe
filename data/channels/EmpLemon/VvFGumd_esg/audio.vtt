00:00.000 --> 00:05.480
Send in the clowns

00:05.520 --> 00:08.920
Feel the terror of copyright

00:08.920 --> 00:10.620
The world is a mess

00:21.140 --> 00:25.280
Oh boy, there go all my YouTube hopes and dreams

00:25.300 --> 00:27.440
Down the drain again

00:27.880 --> 00:29.120
Hey Georgie

00:30.000 --> 00:34.000
You want to find out how to avoid getting copyright claimed on YouTube?

00:34.000 --> 00:36.000
I can show ya.

00:36.000 --> 00:41.000
But I thought YouTube hears our concerns and they care about creators.

00:41.000 --> 00:43.000
Susan said so.

00:43.000 --> 00:46.000
Oh Georgie, you dumb, ignorant child.

00:46.000 --> 00:49.000
This may come off as a bit of a news flash to ya,

00:49.000 --> 00:55.000
but Susan is a lying corporate shill who only cares about appeasing billion dollar corporations.

00:55.000 --> 00:59.000
Either that or she's just really, really incompetent.

00:59.000 --> 01:04.000
Society doesn't care about helping people like us, so it's up to us to help ourselves.

01:04.000 --> 01:10.000
Come along with me down the spiral and I'll show you what YouTube doesn't want you to know.

01:16.000 --> 01:19.000
Welcome back, my friends, to the show that never ends.

01:19.000 --> 01:23.000
In part one of the series, we talked about YouTube's Content ID system

01:23.000 --> 01:28.000
and how it's not exactly the fairest method for dispensing copyright claims.

01:28.000 --> 01:34.000
What you're about to see in this video are real techniques YouTubers use to avoid Content ID detection.

01:34.000 --> 01:41.000
Now before we get into them, I have to say officially that I am not endorsing the activities shown in this video.

01:41.000 --> 01:46.000
I am presenting these topics for educational purposes only.

01:46.000 --> 01:50.000
Whether you choose to exercise these options is your own choice.

01:50.000 --> 01:53.000
I am simply pointing out that these options exist.

01:53.000 --> 01:59.000
So with that out of the way, we are now ready to explore the seedy underbelly of the copyright system.

01:59.000 --> 02:02.000
Welcome to the business of copyright smuggling.

02:06.000 --> 02:14.000
Much like squatting in someone's house, copyright smuggling is a form of civil disobedience that attempts to put the fair back into fair use.

02:14.000 --> 02:19.000
Many YouTubers already engage in copyright smuggling without even realizing it.

02:19.000 --> 02:23.000
Have you ever published a video containing an image you did not create?

02:23.000 --> 02:25.000
Well, you just smuggled it.

02:25.000 --> 02:29.000
Unless you paid to license the image or got express permission from the owner to use it,

02:29.000 --> 02:34.000
then chances are you just committed copyright infringement and probably got away with it.

02:34.000 --> 02:39.000
That's right, the little line of text you see while browsing Google Images actually means something.

02:39.000 --> 02:45.000
Now upon this startling accusation, several questions may be popping through your head such as,

02:45.000 --> 02:52.000
How am I even supposed to get permission from the owner of a random internet image where there's often no way to identify them?

02:52.000 --> 02:57.000
Should it really be illegal to post an image for a five-second joke in a video?

02:57.000 --> 03:03.000
How can you claim to own something that's been freely spread by millions of people since the beginning of the internet?

03:03.000 --> 03:10.000
Shouldn't the legal system focus on more important matters like actual criminals who do physical harm to society?

03:10.000 --> 03:16.000
To which the response is, boo-hoo, shut your mouth, suck it up, and deal with it.

03:16.000 --> 03:18.000
That's how the law works.

03:18.000 --> 03:21.000
If you can't do the time, don't do the crime.

03:23.000 --> 03:24.000
Okay, time's up.

03:27.000 --> 03:33.000
Luckily, we don't really have to deal with it because just like driving five miles an hour over the speed limit,

03:33.000 --> 03:36.000
image copyright on the internet is barely ever enforced.

03:36.000 --> 03:43.000
Since the beginning of the web, images have been a core component of content sharing, memes, and internet culture in general.

03:43.000 --> 03:51.000
Image sharing is so ingrained in the culture of the internet that every browser is designed with an option to copy and save an image just by right-clicking on it.

03:51.000 --> 03:52.000
Copy that.

03:52.000 --> 03:56.000
And even when that fails, you can always just use the print screen button.

03:56.000 --> 04:01.000
Since copying images is so fundamentally rooted in basic internet activity,

04:01.000 --> 04:08.000
attempting to police image copyright online seems like a daunting, foolish, and ultimately pointless exercise,

04:08.000 --> 04:11.000
but it doesn't stop some companies from trying.

04:11.000 --> 04:18.000
Earlier this year, Shutterstock attempted to take down the Spiffing Brits channel for briefly using their watermarked images,

04:18.000 --> 04:25.000
which despite being watermarked and unusable in non-joking circumstances, are apparently still illegal to use.

04:25.000 --> 04:28.000
That's how the law works.

04:28.000 --> 04:34.000
This was most likely just a rare and isolated case of Shutterstock trying to make an example out of someone,

04:36.000 --> 04:42.000
and your chances of actually getting in trouble for posting someone else's image in your video is almost non-existent.

04:42.000 --> 04:46.000
However, as we've seen, it's still very possible.

04:46.000 --> 04:50.000
In general though, smuggling copyrighted images is very easy.

04:50.000 --> 04:53.000
Smuggling video, on the other hand, is a lot more tricky.

04:53.000 --> 05:04.000
Images are fine, but oftentimes YouTubers want a little more to differentiate their content from a glorified PowerPoint.

05:04.000 --> 05:06.000
I mean, after all, we do make videos.

05:06.000 --> 05:09.000
You know, the thing you're watching right now.

05:09.000 --> 05:14.000
So it's often preferable to fill it up with moving images rather than static ones.

05:14.000 --> 05:17.000
A very obvious solution would be to just record your own footage.

05:17.000 --> 05:22.000
Just go out and film a bunch of stuff and you won't have to deal with copyright claims.

05:22.000 --> 05:30.000
A good idea in theory, but far less doable when you realize that you need to invest in a good camera and a tripod or stabilizer if you want the footage to be watchable.

05:30.000 --> 05:35.000
And that's in addition to the amount you have to spend traveling to wherever you have to go to film your footage.

05:35.000 --> 05:39.000
For many YouTubers, the cost of filming footage is simply not worth it.

05:39.000 --> 05:45.000
Some YouTubers instead choose to pay for stock footage, which is a perfectly valid strategy.

05:45.000 --> 05:50.000
However, relying only on stock footage can often leave your videos feeling hollow and generic.

05:50.000 --> 05:52.000
Where's the pizzazz?

05:52.000 --> 05:53.000
Huh?

05:53.000 --> 05:54.000
Look at this place!

05:54.000 --> 05:56.000
I mean, what is the theme here?

05:56.000 --> 05:58.000
It's boring!

05:58.000 --> 06:04.000
Oftentimes you'll find that whatever footage library you're paying to use doesn't have the specific clip you're looking for,

06:04.000 --> 06:10.000
which can end up disconnecting your visuals from your narration, causing them to feel aimless and arbitrary.

06:10.000 --> 06:16.000
If you want your footage to feel aimless, you'd be better off using gameplay footage, which you can record for free.

06:16.000 --> 06:22.000
Recording yourself playing a video game has been a staple of YouTube content ever since the days of the Let's Play.

06:22.000 --> 06:27.000
There's a reason why it's stereotypical for beginner YouTubers to make Minecraft videos,

06:27.000 --> 06:34.000
because gameplay videos are a simple and inexpensive way to start making YouTube content while remaining mostly free from copyright trouble.

06:34.000 --> 06:42.000
I say mostly because some developers consider footage of their games to be copyrighted content, despite the unique inputs of the player.

06:42.000 --> 06:47.000
For years, Nintendo infamously garnished the revenue of YouTubers uploading footage of their games.

06:47.000 --> 06:53.000
Every now and then you'll also see some butthurt indie developer issuing copyright takedowns to silence criticism.

06:53.000 --> 06:58.000
However, just like with image use, you'll rarely get in trouble for uploading gameplay footage,

06:58.000 --> 07:06.000
because most developers simply don't care, enjoy the free publicity, or fear getting barbarically punished by the wrath of angry gamers.

07:06.000 --> 07:11.000
So essentially, smuggling gameplay is as easy as knowing which developers will let you.

07:11.000 --> 07:13.000
But let's get more risky.

07:17.000 --> 07:21.000
How do you get away with using legit copyrighted footage from movies and TV shows?

07:21.000 --> 07:27.000
Well, it turns out there's a group of people on YouTube who have spent years tinkering with this very question.

07:27.000 --> 07:29.000
Our old friends, the bootleggers.

07:29.000 --> 07:37.000
Bootleggers exist to outsmart and trick the Content ID system, and we can use their expertise to help smuggle our own content.

07:37.000 --> 07:41.000
These are some of the ways I've learned to slip copyrighted videos past the system.

07:41.000 --> 07:43.000
Some more practical than others.

07:43.000 --> 07:47.000
The first way is to just upload the video in very low quality.

07:47.000 --> 07:49.000
I'm talking 240p or less.

07:49.000 --> 07:54.000
Obviously today we no longer live in caveman times back when everyone had dial-up internet.

07:54.000 --> 07:59.000
So 240p quality isn't exactly ideal, but it's a valid strategy nonetheless.

07:59.000 --> 08:06.000
Whenever you search for a TV clip on YouTube, you're far more likely to find 240p videos than 1080p ones.

08:06.000 --> 08:11.000
This indicates to me that the system has a far harder time detecting low quality videos.

08:11.000 --> 08:18.000
It's like natural selection in a way, and you can use YouTube search to learn which strategies will contribute to your copyright survival.

08:18.000 --> 08:23.000
Another strategy I've learned through YouTube search is that reaction videos are apparently claim proof.

08:23.000 --> 08:26.000
Guys, I have no idea what is going on right now.

08:26.000 --> 08:30.000
I figured this out when I periodically went to look up some YTPs,

08:30.000 --> 08:36.000
only to find that the original video had been taken down while a trail of reaction videos continued to survive.

08:36.000 --> 08:41.000
For some reason, if you film your ugly potato head and put it in the bottom corner of the video,

08:41.000 --> 08:44.000
you can magically make your content immune to copyright takedowns.

08:44.000 --> 08:51.000
How can reaction channels get away with this while other YouTubers who actually commentate and critique the material get punished?

08:52.000 --> 08:55.000
However, based on the idea of the facecam shield,

08:55.000 --> 09:00.000
we can infer that obscuring the copyrighted content in some way can help deflect claims.

09:00.000 --> 09:05.000
From this theory, you can derive that a fat ice or watermark or logo will do the same trick.

09:05.000 --> 09:11.000
Additionally, you can use the border of the video player itself to obscure the footage by zooming in.

09:11.000 --> 09:17.000
You can also do the opposite to achieve a similar outcome by cropping and panning the video to a smaller window in the frame.

09:17.000 --> 09:21.000
Filling up the negative space with some sort of colored border also helps.

09:25.000 --> 09:29.000
If that's not enough, you may have to do even more to transform the material.

09:29.000 --> 09:33.000
You can try flipping the canvas, adjusting the color or saturation,

09:33.000 --> 09:37.000
applying a vignette or other lighting effects, among many other visual distortions.

09:37.000 --> 09:42.000
One technique I've picked up from the real gyms is to deconstruct a video into a series of images.

09:43.000 --> 09:48.000
This can help you deal with those really pesky scenes that always seem to get claimed no matter what you try.

09:48.000 --> 09:51.000
But out of everything I've mentioned so far,

09:51.000 --> 09:55.000
possibly the most helpful trick is to keep your footage short and choppy.

09:55.000 --> 10:00.000
Remember, the Content ID system is designed to prevent re-uploads of TV shows and movies,

10:00.000 --> 10:04.000
so it's designed to detect long, uninterrupted stretches of content.

10:06.000 --> 10:10.000
You can avoid detection by cutting out parts of your footage in brief intervals

10:10.000 --> 10:13.000
and making sure that the footage doesn't play for too long.

10:14.000 --> 10:17.000
If I had to estimate based on my own experience,

10:17.000 --> 10:20.000
I'd say that 5 seconds or less is most likely safe,

10:20.000 --> 10:24.000
20 seconds is pushing it, and 30 seconds or more is too risky.

10:24.000 --> 10:26.000
As you've probably figured out by now,

10:26.000 --> 10:30.000
smuggling copyrighted video on YouTube can require a lot of acrobatics,

10:30.000 --> 10:36.000
but even that pales in comparison to the most hotly contested content on this website, music.

10:41.000 --> 10:44.000
Over the past few years on YouTube,

10:44.000 --> 10:49.000
possibly the single biggest nuisance to creators on the platform have been music companies.

10:49.000 --> 10:51.000
Out of all media types,

10:51.000 --> 10:56.000
copyrighted music is the most heavily scrutinized by the Content ID system.

10:56.000 --> 11:00.000
In the old days of YouTube, you used to be able to get away with playing 10,

11:00.000 --> 11:03.000
maybe 20 seconds of a song without getting caught.

11:03.000 --> 11:04.000
In recent times,

11:04.000 --> 11:07.000
you used to be able to get away with playing 10,

11:07.000 --> 11:09.000
20 seconds of a song without getting caught.

11:09.000 --> 11:10.000
In recent times,

11:10.000 --> 11:13.000
people have been getting claimed for less than 5 seconds.

11:13.000 --> 11:17.000
One of my YouTube poops was claimed for using the scream from Won't Get Fooled Again,

11:17.000 --> 11:19.000
a 3-second clip.

11:26.000 --> 11:27.000
And if you think that's crazy,

11:27.000 --> 11:31.000
wait till you hear about the time I got claimed for 0 seconds of footage.

11:31.000 --> 11:34.000
That's right, my Never Ever on SpongeBob once got claimed

11:34.000 --> 11:37.000
for using the SpongeBob SquarePants theme song.

11:37.000 --> 11:41.000
The only issue with that being that the song wasn't anywhere in the video.

11:41.000 --> 11:45.000
So let's step back for a second and think about what this actually implies.

11:45.000 --> 11:48.000
I didn't actually use the song they claimed I did,

11:48.000 --> 11:51.000
meaning the Content ID system couldn't have detected it,

11:51.000 --> 11:57.000
meaning that some dude working at Sony Music must have manually claimed the video on a whim

11:57.000 --> 11:59.000
because the video is about SpongeBob,

11:59.000 --> 12:03.000
so they felt that there probably was some SpongeBob music in it

12:03.000 --> 12:07.000
and YouTube just allowed them to submit this totally baseless claim.

12:07.000 --> 12:12.000
Thankfully, the claim was so ridiculous that I guess even the music company felt bad about it

12:12.000 --> 12:15.000
and they actually released the claim after I appealed it.

12:15.000 --> 12:18.000
So that was all fine and dandy until a few months later

12:18.000 --> 12:22.000
when they claimed an entirely different song that wasn't in the video.

12:24.000 --> 12:28.000
Nonsense claims like this are why I list my music in a pastebin link,

12:28.000 --> 12:32.000
to prevent my video from showing up in search results of copyright hounds.

12:32.000 --> 12:37.000
Fortunately for us, we most likely won't have to deal with claims this egregious anymore

12:37.000 --> 12:41.000
because this summer YouTube announced that rights holders can no longer claim videos

12:41.000 --> 12:43.000
without first providing a timestamp

12:43.000 --> 12:47.000
and that they can no longer take revenue for less than five seconds of content.

12:47.000 --> 12:49.000
Good changes for sure.

12:49.000 --> 12:53.000
However, it raises the question of why these options were even allowed in the first place.

12:53.000 --> 12:57.000
If you think I got screwed by this, just look at the Fat Rat,

12:57.000 --> 13:01.000
a YouTube musician who had his original song stolen by a fake copyright holder

13:01.000 --> 13:05.000
who took advantage of YouTube's easily exploitable system.

13:05.000 --> 13:11.000
And if you need one final example to really nail down how berserk YouTube copyright is for music,

13:11.000 --> 13:15.000
my Never Ever on the Cold War featured a clip from Pulp Fiction.

13:15.000 --> 13:18.000
You could argue that it was fair use, you could also argue that it wasn't.

13:18.000 --> 13:21.000
I felt I was using it for rhetorical purposes,

13:21.000 --> 13:26.000
but I accepted the risk given that it was 20 uninterrupted seconds of copyrighted material.

13:26.000 --> 13:31.000
Well, it turns out that this part of my video did get claimed as a song.

13:31.000 --> 13:36.000
That's right, apparently this movie scene was sampled by a 1995 Cypress Hills song

13:36.000 --> 13:39.000
and they got to claim my video because of it.

13:39.000 --> 13:45.000
So according to YouTube's copyright system, a rap song sampling a movie scene is perfectly fine.

13:45.000 --> 13:51.000
But when I make a video sampling that same scene, I somehow owe royalties to the rap group?

13:51.000 --> 13:53.000
What kind of jacked up logic is that?

13:53.000 --> 13:57.000
If anything, I should be paying royalties to Miramax Pictures,

13:57.000 --> 14:04.000
but the power of music copyright on YouTube is so strong that it completely leapfrogs the rights of movie companies.

14:04.000 --> 14:09.000
Video game commentator Jim Sterling has famously utilized YouTube's belligerent music claim system

14:09.000 --> 14:12.000
in what he calls the copyright deadlock.

14:12.000 --> 14:14.000
And I mean, if you weren't going to make money off it anyway,

14:14.000 --> 14:18.000
you might as well make a mockery of the system and take a petty little victory as reward.

14:18.000 --> 14:22.000
YouTube, this is what you make me do now. This is where we're at.

14:22.000 --> 14:28.000
We have a system where it's actually better to infringe on as much copyright as possible than abide by fair use.

14:28.000 --> 14:32.000
A system where I'm now not worried about using whatever music or footage I like

14:32.000 --> 14:35.000
because it literally doesn't matter whose rights I'm encroaching on anymore.

14:35.000 --> 14:40.000
Once you've taken the first step into infringement valley, you can't make it any worse for yourself.

14:40.000 --> 14:46.000
Anyway, you've probably realized by now that smuggling copyrighted music on YouTube is a pretty tall order.

14:46.000 --> 14:50.000
So much so that, in my expert opinion, you shouldn't attempt it at all.

14:50.000 --> 14:54.000
Changing the speed and pitch of a song can usually help avoid acclaim,

14:54.000 --> 14:59.000
but corrupting the audio to that extent often defeats the point of using the song in the first place.

14:59.000 --> 15:04.000
Compared to video, we are much more perceptive to distortions in music.

15:04.000 --> 15:08.000
So altering a song can often be distracting to the audience.

15:08.000 --> 15:11.000
Certainly not an ideal situation for creators.

15:11.000 --> 15:16.000
The only non-intrusive edit you can realistically make to a song is raising and lowering the volume.

15:17.000 --> 15:20.000
While it's possible to avoid acclaim by lowering the volume enough,

15:20.000 --> 15:25.000
for many songs this lies around the faintest threshold of being able to even hear the song,

15:25.000 --> 15:28.000
making it a counterproductive solution in most cases.

15:28.000 --> 15:32.000
The fact of the matter is that some songs on YouTube are simply untouchable.

15:32.000 --> 15:37.000
Any Billboard Top 40 song from the past 10 years will get insta-claimed.

15:37.000 --> 15:42.000
Same goes for legacy hits, basically all the songs that get played on throwback radio stations.

15:42.000 --> 15:46.000
Some songs are so protected that you won't even find them on Vevo.

15:46.000 --> 15:50.000
This is true for most songs from Jimi Hendrix and The Beatles.

15:50.000 --> 15:56.000
Thankfully for kakure smugglers, not all songs are created equal in the eyes of Content ID.

15:56.000 --> 16:01.000
Your ability to smuggle music depends almost entirely on which songs you select.

16:01.000 --> 16:05.000
Songs with vocals are the most likely to get caught by the system.

16:05.000 --> 16:11.000
The human voice leaves a very distinct waveform, making it very easy to identify for detection software.

16:11.000 --> 16:16.000
Of course, you're most likely going to be using music as background audio for narration,

16:16.000 --> 16:19.000
so you probably shouldn't be using lyrical content anyway.

16:19.000 --> 16:24.000
A good technique for both kakure smuggling and general content is to stick to instrumentals.

16:24.000 --> 16:31.000
Perhaps the most common example of this on YouTube is the widespread use of royalty-free music from artists like Kevin MacLeod.

16:31.000 --> 16:38.000
Yeah, it turns out that the pathetic YouTube Audio Swap tool from 2008 grew up into the YouTube Audio Library,

16:38.000 --> 16:43.000
an actually decent resource for royalty-free music built right into the website.

16:43.000 --> 16:49.000
While you can find plenty of decent tracks here, the Audio Library is a default option for a ton of YouTubers,

16:49.000 --> 16:53.000
and as a result, a ton of YouTubers are going to be using these songs.

16:53.000 --> 16:58.000
And just like with stock footage, stock music can easily leave your videos feeling hollow and generic.

16:58.000 --> 17:04.000
You could say it's all worth it for the copyright protection, but not even that is guaranteed.

17:04.000 --> 17:14.000
So I made a video in early 2017 called Dashcon, and in it there's a track which is royalty-free,

17:14.000 --> 17:20.000
it's in the Creative Commons under a 3.0 license, and the only stipulation is that, you know,

17:20.000 --> 17:24.000
please credit it in the description, all that sort of stuff.

17:24.000 --> 17:29.000
So there I was, living my life, and suddenly I got a copyright claim notice.

17:29.000 --> 17:34.000
Two and a half years and eight million views after the video first came out,

17:34.000 --> 17:42.000
and it said that this Creative Commons license track is now subject to copyright, claimed by... I won't say who.

17:42.000 --> 17:47.000
So I dispute the claim, I send the guy a message on Twitter and hope for the best,

17:47.000 --> 17:51.000
but when I found his Twitter I see that there's actually all these other tweets going, you know,

17:51.000 --> 17:55.000
at his name, and a bunch of other people who all have the same problem.

17:55.000 --> 17:59.000
It's like a thousand people have all been copy claimed.

17:59.000 --> 18:05.000
Turns out this is what he did. He had seen how many views he got on his royalty-free music,

18:05.000 --> 18:09.000
so he tried to take the thing out of the Creative Commons, and the way he was going to do this was

18:09.000 --> 18:15.000
make an announcement on his personal website and say, hey, you've got a year's notice,

18:15.000 --> 18:21.000
as if we were ever going to read his personal website, and then otherwise, if you use the music after 2018,

18:21.000 --> 18:28.000
you're subject to a $50 license. Anyway, I sent him a message, and I said, yeah, look, I'll pay the ransom.

18:28.000 --> 18:34.000
Just give me my video back as soon as possible, and then, you know, I'll deal with the problem from there.

18:34.000 --> 18:40.000
The priority was to get the video back. Anyway, whatever, I just said, yep, fine, and I'll deal with it later.

18:40.000 --> 18:46.000
But the best part was, okay, while all this is going on, everyone else is just, like, furious.

18:46.000 --> 18:50.000
They're not going to pay the ransom, and Keemstar catches wind of this, and all of a sudden,

18:50.000 --> 18:55.000
this dude is just getting trashed from every direction, and it's absolutely hilarious.

18:55.000 --> 19:02.000
Anyway, long story short, two days later, his Twitter is gone, his email is gone.

19:02.000 --> 19:06.000
If you try to email him now, it just returns to recipient, and all of the claims were dropped,

19:06.000 --> 19:11.000
and as far as I can tell, his presence has been pretty much wiped from the internet.

19:11.000 --> 19:19.000
More risky than royalty-free music is music from independent online artists.

19:19.000 --> 19:26.000
Stuff like Vaporwave, Synthwave, and lo-fi hip-hop beats to relax slash study to are not registered as royalty-free,

19:26.000 --> 19:30.000
but the artists are typically chill enough to not care about policing their copyright.

19:30.000 --> 19:35.000
If you're feeling extra ballsy, you could try using background tracks from popular songs,

19:35.000 --> 19:39.000
whether it's hip-hop instrumentals or karaoke versions of rock songs.

19:39.000 --> 19:48.000
Typically, music with easily identifiable drum and bass signatures are more likely to be claimed,

19:48.000 --> 19:52.000
so if you want to use a popular song but fear copyright punishment,

19:52.000 --> 19:55.000
you can try finding an 8-bit or MIDI version of the song.

19:55.000 --> 20:01.000
Otherwise, you might be better off using something more irregular, like jazz or classical music.

20:01.000 --> 20:06.000
Contrary to popular belief, classical music does frequently get claimed on YouTube.

20:06.000 --> 20:10.000
Even though the songs are public domain, they often succumb to performance claims.

20:10.000 --> 20:16.000
But with that being said, it's pretty easy to use classical music as long as you're talking over it the whole time.

20:16.000 --> 20:20.000
Jazz is a bit more tricky to get away with because the genre is much more contemporary.

20:20.000 --> 20:26.000
A good rule of thumb when judging the copyright risk of a song is that older songs tend to be less risky

20:26.000 --> 20:31.000
because less people care about them and music companies have less of a reason to ruthlessly guard them.

20:31.000 --> 20:35.000
The same theory applies to songs which are historically obscure,

20:35.000 --> 20:41.000
songs that no one would probably know about if it wasn't for, ironically, YouTube's algorithm promoting them.

20:41.000 --> 20:46.000
These songs aren't risk-free, but music nerds will respect you more if you use them.

20:46.000 --> 20:54.000
However, with all that considered, the holy grail of smuggleable music on YouTube can be found in video game soundtracks.

20:54.000 --> 21:01.000
While video game publishers own the rights to their music, very few of them actually bother to enforce their copyright.

21:01.000 --> 21:07.000
Most video game music isn't even registered in the Content ID system or any digital music bank,

21:07.000 --> 21:10.000
making them practically free to use on YouTube.

21:10.000 --> 21:14.000
In fact, most game developers haven't actually released their music commercially

21:14.000 --> 21:18.000
and the copies you find on YouTube have been ripped directly from the game itself.

21:18.000 --> 21:23.000
Video game music tends to have much more variety than the typical royalty-free music you find on YouTube

21:23.000 --> 21:26.000
and in my opinion, it tends to sound a lot better too.

21:26.000 --> 21:30.000
Rarely will you find a video game song that gets copyright claimed,

21:30.000 --> 21:37.000
but just to be sure, you can check if the song is at risk of a claim by looking for licensing text at the bottom of the description on YouTube.

21:37.000 --> 21:42.000
If the raw version of the song isn't claimed, that means it's bound to be safe for use in your video,

21:42.000 --> 21:45.000
but that still doesn't guarantee that it's going to be safe forever.

21:55.000 --> 21:59.000
If you copyright smuggle in a video, the system is bound to catch up with you eventually.

21:59.000 --> 22:03.000
Nearly all copyrighted content is doomed to get claimed at some point.

22:03.000 --> 22:09.000
My back catalogue of videos is in ruins from claims that have gradually piled up over the years.

22:09.000 --> 22:14.000
As your channel grows, so too does your risk of encountering copyright claims.

22:14.000 --> 22:18.000
The stuff you can get away with now is likely going to get you caught a few years down the line,

22:18.000 --> 22:22.000
so as a YouTuber, you have to continually search for safer options.

22:22.000 --> 22:27.000
Personally, I'm not too upset about this because I don't mind losing out on pennies of revenue

22:27.000 --> 22:30.000
from old YouTube poops that nobody watches anymore.

22:30.000 --> 22:38.000
And to be honest, it would be very foolish and entitled of me to expect revenue from old content that nobody watches anymore.

22:38.000 --> 22:45.000
So with all that said, if you choose to lead the life of a copyright smuggler, be sure to smuggle responsibly.

22:45.000 --> 22:54.000
When asked by those seeking advice, Isaiah responded simply with a phrase which would soon become a mantra.

22:54.000 --> 22:56.000
Don't get hit.

23:08.000 --> 23:12.000
But wait just a second here. Why should we have to worry about any of this?

23:12.000 --> 23:16.000
Copyright smuggling isn't some new groundbreaking thing.

23:16.000 --> 23:20.000
People have been manipulating content to post online for ages now.

23:20.000 --> 23:24.000
Even though this whole time, the law has dictated that we shouldn't.

23:24.000 --> 23:27.000
Is copyright smuggling even ethical?

23:27.000 --> 23:30.000
And if not, then how is it so normal?

23:30.000 --> 23:36.000
Coming up in part three of YouTube Copyright School, we examine why things are the way they are.

23:36.000 --> 23:48.000
People of society, it is I, Joker Emp, standing here in front of a pile of money that I've made from copyright smuggling and selling your personal data.

23:48.000 --> 23:53.000
Riddle me this, riddle me that. Guess my password before the time runs out.

23:53.000 --> 24:01.000
Having a little trouble? Well, that's because I use Dashlane to generate a password so secure that none of you can possibly guess it.

24:02.000 --> 24:08.000
Click out of this ad and I'll make the FTC fine you $42,000.

24:08.000 --> 24:13.000
I'm just trying to show you how pathetic your attempts at online security really are.

24:13.000 --> 24:23.000
I've been taking a look at some of your passwords and some of these are so idiotic that you'd have to be insane to think that they could protect you from today's breed of script kiddies and keyboard warriors.

24:23.000 --> 24:31.000
Introduce a little anarchy into your password and only then can you survive the chaos of the digital downward spiral.

24:31.000 --> 24:34.000
Well, time's almost up. Did you figure it out?

24:36.000 --> 24:38.000
Boy, bet you didn't expect that, now did you?

24:38.000 --> 24:40.000
That's the power of Dashlane.

24:53.000 --> 24:57.000
Riddle me this, riddle me that.
