0	5480	Send in the clowns
5520	8920	Feel the terror of copyright
8920	10620	The world is a mess
21140	25280	Oh boy, there go all my YouTube hopes and dreams
25300	27440	Down the drain again
27880	29120	Hey Georgie
30000	34000	You want to find out how to avoid getting copyright claimed on YouTube?
34000	36000	I can show ya.
36000	41000	But I thought YouTube hears our concerns and they care about creators.
41000	43000	Susan said so.
43000	46000	Oh Georgie, you dumb, ignorant child.
46000	49000	This may come off as a bit of a news flash to ya,
49000	55000	but Susan is a lying corporate shill who only cares about appeasing billion dollar corporations.
55000	59000	Either that or she's just really, really incompetent.
59000	64000	Society doesn't care about helping people like us, so it's up to us to help ourselves.
64000	70000	Come along with me down the spiral and I'll show you what YouTube doesn't want you to know.
76000	79000	Welcome back, my friends, to the show that never ends.
79000	83000	In part one of the series, we talked about YouTube's Content ID system
83000	88000	and how it's not exactly the fairest method for dispensing copyright claims.
88000	94000	What you're about to see in this video are real techniques YouTubers use to avoid Content ID detection.
94000	101000	Now before we get into them, I have to say officially that I am not endorsing the activities shown in this video.
101000	106000	I am presenting these topics for educational purposes only.
106000	110000	Whether you choose to exercise these options is your own choice.
110000	113000	I am simply pointing out that these options exist.
113000	119000	So with that out of the way, we are now ready to explore the seedy underbelly of the copyright system.
119000	122000	Welcome to the business of copyright smuggling.
126000	134000	Much like squatting in someone's house, copyright smuggling is a form of civil disobedience that attempts to put the fair back into fair use.
134000	139000	Many YouTubers already engage in copyright smuggling without even realizing it.
139000	143000	Have you ever published a video containing an image you did not create?
143000	145000	Well, you just smuggled it.
145000	149000	Unless you paid to license the image or got express permission from the owner to use it,
149000	154000	then chances are you just committed copyright infringement and probably got away with it.
154000	159000	That's right, the little line of text you see while browsing Google Images actually means something.
159000	165000	Now upon this startling accusation, several questions may be popping through your head such as,
165000	172000	How am I even supposed to get permission from the owner of a random internet image where there's often no way to identify them?
172000	177000	Should it really be illegal to post an image for a five-second joke in a video?
177000	183000	How can you claim to own something that's been freely spread by millions of people since the beginning of the internet?
183000	190000	Shouldn't the legal system focus on more important matters like actual criminals who do physical harm to society?
190000	196000	To which the response is, boo-hoo, shut your mouth, suck it up, and deal with it.
196000	198000	That's how the law works.
198000	201000	If you can't do the time, don't do the crime.
203000	204000	Okay, time's up.
207000	213000	Luckily, we don't really have to deal with it because just like driving five miles an hour over the speed limit,
213000	216000	image copyright on the internet is barely ever enforced.
216000	223000	Since the beginning of the web, images have been a core component of content sharing, memes, and internet culture in general.
223000	231000	Image sharing is so ingrained in the culture of the internet that every browser is designed with an option to copy and save an image just by right-clicking on it.
231000	232000	Copy that.
232000	236000	And even when that fails, you can always just use the print screen button.
236000	241000	Since copying images is so fundamentally rooted in basic internet activity,
241000	248000	attempting to police image copyright online seems like a daunting, foolish, and ultimately pointless exercise,
248000	251000	but it doesn't stop some companies from trying.
251000	258000	Earlier this year, Shutterstock attempted to take down the Spiffing Brits channel for briefly using their watermarked images,
258000	265000	which despite being watermarked and unusable in non-joking circumstances, are apparently still illegal to use.
265000	268000	That's how the law works.
268000	274000	This was most likely just a rare and isolated case of Shutterstock trying to make an example out of someone,
276000	282000	and your chances of actually getting in trouble for posting someone else's image in your video is almost non-existent.
282000	286000	However, as we've seen, it's still very possible.
286000	290000	In general though, smuggling copyrighted images is very easy.
290000	293000	Smuggling video, on the other hand, is a lot more tricky.
293000	304000	Images are fine, but oftentimes YouTubers want a little more to differentiate their content from a glorified PowerPoint.
304000	306000	I mean, after all, we do make videos.
306000	309000	You know, the thing you're watching right now.
309000	314000	So it's often preferable to fill it up with moving images rather than static ones.
314000	317000	A very obvious solution would be to just record your own footage.
317000	322000	Just go out and film a bunch of stuff and you won't have to deal with copyright claims.
322000	330000	A good idea in theory, but far less doable when you realize that you need to invest in a good camera and a tripod or stabilizer if you want the footage to be watchable.
330000	335000	And that's in addition to the amount you have to spend traveling to wherever you have to go to film your footage.
335000	339000	For many YouTubers, the cost of filming footage is simply not worth it.
339000	345000	Some YouTubers instead choose to pay for stock footage, which is a perfectly valid strategy.
345000	350000	However, relying only on stock footage can often leave your videos feeling hollow and generic.
350000	352000	Where's the pizzazz?
352000	353000	Huh?
353000	354000	Look at this place!
354000	356000	I mean, what is the theme here?
356000	358000	It's boring!
358000	364000	Oftentimes you'll find that whatever footage library you're paying to use doesn't have the specific clip you're looking for,
364000	370000	which can end up disconnecting your visuals from your narration, causing them to feel aimless and arbitrary.
370000	376000	If you want your footage to feel aimless, you'd be better off using gameplay footage, which you can record for free.
376000	382000	Recording yourself playing a video game has been a staple of YouTube content ever since the days of the Let's Play.
382000	387000	There's a reason why it's stereotypical for beginner YouTubers to make Minecraft videos,
387000	394000	because gameplay videos are a simple and inexpensive way to start making YouTube content while remaining mostly free from copyright trouble.
394000	402000	I say mostly because some developers consider footage of their games to be copyrighted content, despite the unique inputs of the player.
402000	407000	For years, Nintendo infamously garnished the revenue of YouTubers uploading footage of their games.
407000	413000	Every now and then you'll also see some butthurt indie developer issuing copyright takedowns to silence criticism.
413000	418000	However, just like with image use, you'll rarely get in trouble for uploading gameplay footage,
418000	426000	because most developers simply don't care, enjoy the free publicity, or fear getting barbarically punished by the wrath of angry gamers.
426000	431000	So essentially, smuggling gameplay is as easy as knowing which developers will let you.
431000	433000	But let's get more risky.
437000	441000	How do you get away with using legit copyrighted footage from movies and TV shows?
441000	447000	Well, it turns out there's a group of people on YouTube who have spent years tinkering with this very question.
447000	449000	Our old friends, the bootleggers.
449000	457000	Bootleggers exist to outsmart and trick the Content ID system, and we can use their expertise to help smuggle our own content.
457000	461000	These are some of the ways I've learned to slip copyrighted videos past the system.
461000	463000	Some more practical than others.
463000	467000	The first way is to just upload the video in very low quality.
467000	469000	I'm talking 240p or less.
469000	474000	Obviously today we no longer live in caveman times back when everyone had dial-up internet.
474000	479000	So 240p quality isn't exactly ideal, but it's a valid strategy nonetheless.
479000	486000	Whenever you search for a TV clip on YouTube, you're far more likely to find 240p videos than 1080p ones.
486000	491000	This indicates to me that the system has a far harder time detecting low quality videos.
491000	498000	It's like natural selection in a way, and you can use YouTube search to learn which strategies will contribute to your copyright survival.
498000	503000	Another strategy I've learned through YouTube search is that reaction videos are apparently claim proof.
503000	506000	Guys, I have no idea what is going on right now.
506000	510000	I figured this out when I periodically went to look up some YTPs,
510000	516000	only to find that the original video had been taken down while a trail of reaction videos continued to survive.
516000	521000	For some reason, if you film your ugly potato head and put it in the bottom corner of the video,
521000	524000	you can magically make your content immune to copyright takedowns.
524000	531000	How can reaction channels get away with this while other YouTubers who actually commentate and critique the material get punished?
532000	535000	However, based on the idea of the facecam shield,
535000	540000	we can infer that obscuring the copyrighted content in some way can help deflect claims.
540000	545000	From this theory, you can derive that a fat ice or watermark or logo will do the same trick.
545000	551000	Additionally, you can use the border of the video player itself to obscure the footage by zooming in.
551000	557000	You can also do the opposite to achieve a similar outcome by cropping and panning the video to a smaller window in the frame.
557000	561000	Filling up the negative space with some sort of colored border also helps.
565000	569000	If that's not enough, you may have to do even more to transform the material.
569000	573000	You can try flipping the canvas, adjusting the color or saturation,
573000	577000	applying a vignette or other lighting effects, among many other visual distortions.
577000	582000	One technique I've picked up from the real gyms is to deconstruct a video into a series of images.
583000	588000	This can help you deal with those really pesky scenes that always seem to get claimed no matter what you try.
588000	591000	But out of everything I've mentioned so far,
591000	595000	possibly the most helpful trick is to keep your footage short and choppy.
595000	600000	Remember, the Content ID system is designed to prevent re-uploads of TV shows and movies,
600000	604000	so it's designed to detect long, uninterrupted stretches of content.
606000	610000	You can avoid detection by cutting out parts of your footage in brief intervals
610000	613000	and making sure that the footage doesn't play for too long.
614000	617000	If I had to estimate based on my own experience,
617000	620000	I'd say that 5 seconds or less is most likely safe,
620000	624000	20 seconds is pushing it, and 30 seconds or more is too risky.
624000	626000	As you've probably figured out by now,
626000	630000	smuggling copyrighted video on YouTube can require a lot of acrobatics,
630000	636000	but even that pales in comparison to the most hotly contested content on this website, music.
641000	644000	Over the past few years on YouTube,
644000	649000	possibly the single biggest nuisance to creators on the platform have been music companies.
649000	651000	Out of all media types,
651000	656000	copyrighted music is the most heavily scrutinized by the Content ID system.
656000	660000	In the old days of YouTube, you used to be able to get away with playing 10,
660000	663000	maybe 20 seconds of a song without getting caught.
663000	664000	In recent times,
664000	667000	you used to be able to get away with playing 10,
667000	669000	20 seconds of a song without getting caught.
669000	670000	In recent times,
670000	673000	people have been getting claimed for less than 5 seconds.
673000	677000	One of my YouTube poops was claimed for using the scream from Won't Get Fooled Again,
677000	679000	a 3-second clip.
686000	687000	And if you think that's crazy,
687000	691000	wait till you hear about the time I got claimed for 0 seconds of footage.
691000	694000	That's right, my Never Ever on SpongeBob once got claimed
694000	697000	for using the SpongeBob SquarePants theme song.
697000	701000	The only issue with that being that the song wasn't anywhere in the video.
701000	705000	So let's step back for a second and think about what this actually implies.
705000	708000	I didn't actually use the song they claimed I did,
708000	711000	meaning the Content ID system couldn't have detected it,
711000	717000	meaning that some dude working at Sony Music must have manually claimed the video on a whim
717000	719000	because the video is about SpongeBob,
719000	723000	so they felt that there probably was some SpongeBob music in it
723000	727000	and YouTube just allowed them to submit this totally baseless claim.
727000	732000	Thankfully, the claim was so ridiculous that I guess even the music company felt bad about it
732000	735000	and they actually released the claim after I appealed it.
735000	738000	So that was all fine and dandy until a few months later
738000	742000	when they claimed an entirely different song that wasn't in the video.
744000	748000	Nonsense claims like this are why I list my music in a pastebin link,
748000	752000	to prevent my video from showing up in search results of copyright hounds.
752000	757000	Fortunately for us, we most likely won't have to deal with claims this egregious anymore
757000	761000	because this summer YouTube announced that rights holders can no longer claim videos
761000	763000	without first providing a timestamp
763000	767000	and that they can no longer take revenue for less than five seconds of content.
767000	769000	Good changes for sure.
769000	773000	However, it raises the question of why these options were even allowed in the first place.
773000	777000	If you think I got screwed by this, just look at the Fat Rat,
777000	781000	a YouTube musician who had his original song stolen by a fake copyright holder
781000	785000	who took advantage of YouTube's easily exploitable system.
785000	791000	And if you need one final example to really nail down how berserk YouTube copyright is for music,
791000	795000	my Never Ever on the Cold War featured a clip from Pulp Fiction.
795000	798000	You could argue that it was fair use, you could also argue that it wasn't.
798000	801000	I felt I was using it for rhetorical purposes,
801000	806000	but I accepted the risk given that it was 20 uninterrupted seconds of copyrighted material.
806000	811000	Well, it turns out that this part of my video did get claimed as a song.
811000	816000	That's right, apparently this movie scene was sampled by a 1995 Cypress Hills song
816000	819000	and they got to claim my video because of it.
819000	825000	So according to YouTube's copyright system, a rap song sampling a movie scene is perfectly fine.
825000	831000	But when I make a video sampling that same scene, I somehow owe royalties to the rap group?
831000	833000	What kind of jacked up logic is that?
833000	837000	If anything, I should be paying royalties to Miramax Pictures,
837000	844000	but the power of music copyright on YouTube is so strong that it completely leapfrogs the rights of movie companies.
844000	849000	Video game commentator Jim Sterling has famously utilized YouTube's belligerent music claim system
849000	852000	in what he calls the copyright deadlock.
852000	854000	And I mean, if you weren't going to make money off it anyway,
854000	858000	you might as well make a mockery of the system and take a petty little victory as reward.
858000	862000	YouTube, this is what you make me do now. This is where we're at.
862000	868000	We have a system where it's actually better to infringe on as much copyright as possible than abide by fair use.
868000	872000	A system where I'm now not worried about using whatever music or footage I like
872000	875000	because it literally doesn't matter whose rights I'm encroaching on anymore.
875000	880000	Once you've taken the first step into infringement valley, you can't make it any worse for yourself.
880000	886000	Anyway, you've probably realized by now that smuggling copyrighted music on YouTube is a pretty tall order.
886000	890000	So much so that, in my expert opinion, you shouldn't attempt it at all.
890000	894000	Changing the speed and pitch of a song can usually help avoid acclaim,
894000	899000	but corrupting the audio to that extent often defeats the point of using the song in the first place.
899000	904000	Compared to video, we are much more perceptive to distortions in music.
904000	908000	So altering a song can often be distracting to the audience.
908000	911000	Certainly not an ideal situation for creators.
911000	916000	The only non-intrusive edit you can realistically make to a song is raising and lowering the volume.
917000	920000	While it's possible to avoid acclaim by lowering the volume enough,
920000	925000	for many songs this lies around the faintest threshold of being able to even hear the song,
925000	928000	making it a counterproductive solution in most cases.
928000	932000	The fact of the matter is that some songs on YouTube are simply untouchable.
932000	937000	Any Billboard Top 40 song from the past 10 years will get insta-claimed.
937000	942000	Same goes for legacy hits, basically all the songs that get played on throwback radio stations.
942000	946000	Some songs are so protected that you won't even find them on Vevo.
946000	950000	This is true for most songs from Jimi Hendrix and The Beatles.
950000	956000	Thankfully for kakure smugglers, not all songs are created equal in the eyes of Content ID.
956000	961000	Your ability to smuggle music depends almost entirely on which songs you select.
961000	965000	Songs with vocals are the most likely to get caught by the system.
965000	971000	The human voice leaves a very distinct waveform, making it very easy to identify for detection software.
971000	976000	Of course, you're most likely going to be using music as background audio for narration,
976000	979000	so you probably shouldn't be using lyrical content anyway.
979000	984000	A good technique for both kakure smuggling and general content is to stick to instrumentals.
984000	991000	Perhaps the most common example of this on YouTube is the widespread use of royalty-free music from artists like Kevin MacLeod.
991000	998000	Yeah, it turns out that the pathetic YouTube Audio Swap tool from 2008 grew up into the YouTube Audio Library,
998000	1003000	an actually decent resource for royalty-free music built right into the website.
1003000	1009000	While you can find plenty of decent tracks here, the Audio Library is a default option for a ton of YouTubers,
1009000	1013000	and as a result, a ton of YouTubers are going to be using these songs.
1013000	1018000	And just like with stock footage, stock music can easily leave your videos feeling hollow and generic.
1018000	1024000	You could say it's all worth it for the copyright protection, but not even that is guaranteed.
1024000	1034000	So I made a video in early 2017 called Dashcon, and in it there's a track which is royalty-free,
1034000	1040000	it's in the Creative Commons under a 3.0 license, and the only stipulation is that, you know,
1040000	1044000	please credit it in the description, all that sort of stuff.
1044000	1049000	So there I was, living my life, and suddenly I got a copyright claim notice.
1049000	1054000	Two and a half years and eight million views after the video first came out,
1054000	1062000	and it said that this Creative Commons license track is now subject to copyright, claimed by... I won't say who.
1062000	1067000	So I dispute the claim, I send the guy a message on Twitter and hope for the best,
1067000	1071000	but when I found his Twitter I see that there's actually all these other tweets going, you know,
1071000	1075000	at his name, and a bunch of other people who all have the same problem.
1075000	1079000	It's like a thousand people have all been copy claimed.
1079000	1085000	Turns out this is what he did. He had seen how many views he got on his royalty-free music,
1085000	1089000	so he tried to take the thing out of the Creative Commons, and the way he was going to do this was
1089000	1095000	make an announcement on his personal website and say, hey, you've got a year's notice,
1095000	1101000	as if we were ever going to read his personal website, and then otherwise, if you use the music after 2018,
1101000	1108000	you're subject to a $50 license. Anyway, I sent him a message, and I said, yeah, look, I'll pay the ransom.
1108000	1114000	Just give me my video back as soon as possible, and then, you know, I'll deal with the problem from there.
1114000	1120000	The priority was to get the video back. Anyway, whatever, I just said, yep, fine, and I'll deal with it later.
1120000	1126000	But the best part was, okay, while all this is going on, everyone else is just, like, furious.
1126000	1130000	They're not going to pay the ransom, and Keemstar catches wind of this, and all of a sudden,
1130000	1135000	this dude is just getting trashed from every direction, and it's absolutely hilarious.
1135000	1142000	Anyway, long story short, two days later, his Twitter is gone, his email is gone.
1142000	1146000	If you try to email him now, it just returns to recipient, and all of the claims were dropped,
1146000	1151000	and as far as I can tell, his presence has been pretty much wiped from the internet.
1151000	1159000	More risky than royalty-free music is music from independent online artists.
1159000	1166000	Stuff like Vaporwave, Synthwave, and lo-fi hip-hop beats to relax slash study to are not registered as royalty-free,
1166000	1170000	but the artists are typically chill enough to not care about policing their copyright.
1170000	1175000	If you're feeling extra ballsy, you could try using background tracks from popular songs,
1175000	1179000	whether it's hip-hop instrumentals or karaoke versions of rock songs.
1179000	1188000	Typically, music with easily identifiable drum and bass signatures are more likely to be claimed,
1188000	1192000	so if you want to use a popular song but fear copyright punishment,
1192000	1195000	you can try finding an 8-bit or MIDI version of the song.
1195000	1201000	Otherwise, you might be better off using something more irregular, like jazz or classical music.
1201000	1206000	Contrary to popular belief, classical music does frequently get claimed on YouTube.
1206000	1210000	Even though the songs are public domain, they often succumb to performance claims.
1210000	1216000	But with that being said, it's pretty easy to use classical music as long as you're talking over it the whole time.
1216000	1220000	Jazz is a bit more tricky to get away with because the genre is much more contemporary.
1220000	1226000	A good rule of thumb when judging the copyright risk of a song is that older songs tend to be less risky
1226000	1231000	because less people care about them and music companies have less of a reason to ruthlessly guard them.
1231000	1235000	The same theory applies to songs which are historically obscure,
1235000	1241000	songs that no one would probably know about if it wasn't for, ironically, YouTube's algorithm promoting them.
1241000	1246000	These songs aren't risk-free, but music nerds will respect you more if you use them.
1246000	1254000	However, with all that considered, the holy grail of smuggleable music on YouTube can be found in video game soundtracks.
1254000	1261000	While video game publishers own the rights to their music, very few of them actually bother to enforce their copyright.
1261000	1267000	Most video game music isn't even registered in the Content ID system or any digital music bank,
1267000	1270000	making them practically free to use on YouTube.
1270000	1274000	In fact, most game developers haven't actually released their music commercially
1274000	1278000	and the copies you find on YouTube have been ripped directly from the game itself.
1278000	1283000	Video game music tends to have much more variety than the typical royalty-free music you find on YouTube
1283000	1286000	and in my opinion, it tends to sound a lot better too.
1286000	1290000	Rarely will you find a video game song that gets copyright claimed,
1290000	1297000	but just to be sure, you can check if the song is at risk of a claim by looking for licensing text at the bottom of the description on YouTube.
1297000	1302000	If the raw version of the song isn't claimed, that means it's bound to be safe for use in your video,
1302000	1305000	but that still doesn't guarantee that it's going to be safe forever.
1315000	1319000	If you copyright smuggle in a video, the system is bound to catch up with you eventually.
1319000	1323000	Nearly all copyrighted content is doomed to get claimed at some point.
1323000	1329000	My back catalogue of videos is in ruins from claims that have gradually piled up over the years.
1329000	1334000	As your channel grows, so too does your risk of encountering copyright claims.
1334000	1338000	The stuff you can get away with now is likely going to get you caught a few years down the line,
1338000	1342000	so as a YouTuber, you have to continually search for safer options.
1342000	1347000	Personally, I'm not too upset about this because I don't mind losing out on pennies of revenue
1347000	1350000	from old YouTube poops that nobody watches anymore.
1350000	1358000	And to be honest, it would be very foolish and entitled of me to expect revenue from old content that nobody watches anymore.
1358000	1365000	So with all that said, if you choose to lead the life of a copyright smuggler, be sure to smuggle responsibly.
1365000	1374000	When asked by those seeking advice, Isaiah responded simply with a phrase which would soon become a mantra.
1374000	1376000	Don't get hit.
1388000	1392000	But wait just a second here. Why should we have to worry about any of this?
1392000	1396000	Copyright smuggling isn't some new groundbreaking thing.
1396000	1400000	People have been manipulating content to post online for ages now.
1400000	1404000	Even though this whole time, the law has dictated that we shouldn't.
1404000	1407000	Is copyright smuggling even ethical?
1407000	1410000	And if not, then how is it so normal?
1410000	1416000	Coming up in part three of YouTube Copyright School, we examine why things are the way they are.
1416000	1428000	People of society, it is I, Joker Emp, standing here in front of a pile of money that I've made from copyright smuggling and selling your personal data.
1428000	1433000	Riddle me this, riddle me that. Guess my password before the time runs out.
1433000	1441000	Having a little trouble? Well, that's because I use Dashlane to generate a password so secure that none of you can possibly guess it.
1442000	1448000	Click out of this ad and I'll make the FTC fine you $42,000.
1448000	1453000	I'm just trying to show you how pathetic your attempts at online security really are.
1453000	1463000	I've been taking a look at some of your passwords and some of these are so idiotic that you'd have to be insane to think that they could protect you from today's breed of script kiddies and keyboard warriors.
1463000	1471000	Introduce a little anarchy into your password and only then can you survive the chaos of the digital downward spiral.
1471000	1474000	Well, time's almost up. Did you figure it out?
1476000	1478000	Boy, bet you didn't expect that, now did you?
1478000	1480000	That's the power of Dashlane.
1493000	1497000	Riddle me this, riddle me that.
