00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
If you've been around long enough, you've probably encountered this image,

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:09,360
The Great Wave of Kanagawa by Japanese artist Katsushika Hokusai.

3
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:16,480
From its humble origins in 1831, it has since gone on to become one of the most reproduced paintings in history.

4
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:22,320
Few other works have managed to captivate our attention with such striking elegance and power.

5
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:27,040
Due to how closely intertwined Japanese culture is with such events,

6
00:00:27,040 --> 00:00:32,560
many onlookers over the years have assumed that the Great Wave is depicting a tsunami.

7
00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:39,600
However, modern research suggests that Hokusai's illustration may actually feature something entirely different,

8
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:48,000
a phenomenon which, in some regards, is even more terrifying, one which we have only just begun to understand.

9
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:53,280
It would seem that mankind has always had a complex relationship with the sea.

10
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:58,960
For millennia, it was perhaps the single biggest obstruction standing in the way of human progress.

11
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:02,880
Today, we tend to think of the ocean as a conquered frontier,

12
00:01:02,880 --> 00:01:07,760
a stepping stone in the development of civilization that we overcame long ago.

13
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:15,360
With that in mind, it's easy to lose sight of just how recently our apparent mastery of maritime travel was achieved.

14
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:20,400
It's common knowledge that human beings now exist pretty much everywhere on the planet,

15
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:22,800
but that wasn't always the case.

16
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:30,720
For the first 90% of our existence, the ocean served as an impassable barrier, restricting us to the Eurasian landmass.

17
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:37,200
It was only through the onset of Ice Age events when we could access new territory through temporary land bridges.

18
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:42,000
Islands and especially remote places continued to elude us for millennia.

19
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:49,760
The prospect of crossing deep water for long distances proved far too daunting until significant strides in watercraft could be made.

20
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:55,200
It took until 5,000 years ago before the Caribbean islands saw their first inhabitants.

21
00:01:55,200 --> 00:02:02,960
Madagascar was reached just 2,500 years ago and New Zealand only saw its first settlers within the last millennium.

22
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:07,680
Even then, no one else on the planet had any idea that these places existed.

23
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:13,600
Only after the advent of maritime trade routes did the true scope of civilization become known.

24
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:17,920
By the 1500s, man would successfully circumnavigate the globe,

25
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:21,920
allowing for the creation of the first comprehensive world maps.

26
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:28,160
When it comes to old maps, it's interesting to watch them gradually start to become more accurate over time.

27
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:33,680
But what's more interesting is a little detail which began to appear on many of them.

28
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:41,920
During the Age of Discovery, it was common for some cartographers to include illustrations of sea monsters in the more vast stretches of ocean.

29
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:48,560
As the number of transcontinental voyages increased, a few ships would never reach their destination.

30
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:53,680
With no way of knowing what happened to them, our imaginations were left to run wild.

31
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:59,680
And so, the ocean would earn its reputation as a place of great mystery and mythology.

32
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:06,320
It was common for seafaring cultures to attribute the cruelty of the ocean to some kind of vengeful deity.

33
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:13,120
The unknowable vastness of the sea sparked wild speculation of fantastical lands waiting to be discovered.

34
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:21,920
The fabled island of Atlantis would captivate scholars for centuries as a utopian civilization which tragically sunk beneath the waves.

35
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:29,200
Equally unverifiable was the lost continent of Mu, rumored to exist between Asia and the Americas.

36
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:33,760
Others saw the ocean as home to monstrous beings beyond our comprehension.

37
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:39,120
From the colossal ship-devouring Leviathan to the unsettling temptation of Sirens,

38
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:46,480
whose irresistible song will lure sailors to their doom, the sea continues to tempt us to this day.

39
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:54,080
For as long as maritime trade has been logistically viable, the rich and powerful have gravitated towards the water's edge.

40
00:03:54,080 --> 00:04:00,880
In the modern day, waterfront property continues to reign supreme as the most desirable real estate on the planet.

41
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:06,800
Despite the ocean's adversarial role in our history, we sure do love being near it.

42
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:11,680
Perhaps it satisfies some latent desire to flirt with the uncontrollable.

43
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:18,640
It seems like everyone wants to come to the water until all of a sudden, the water starts coming to us.

44
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:25,040
As many in America have ventured closer to the coast, the Cascade Indians have migrated inland.

45
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:31,360
Their ancestral wisdom warns of a terrible tragedy for those who fail to respect the power of the sea.

46
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:34,880
The legend they follow is very much based on a real incident.

47
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:44,080
The Cascadia tsunami of 1700, an event so destructive that its effects were observed more than 4,500 miles away in Japan.

48
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:50,080
In recent times, a tsunami of comparable strength occurred in 2004 off the island of Sumatra,

49
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:55,600
where a magnitude 9.2 earthquake triggered a wall of water up to a hundred feet tall.

50
00:04:55,600 --> 00:05:00,560
Coastlines near the epicenter were inundated as far as two and a half miles inland.

51
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:08,960
Currently, it stands as the deadliest natural disaster of the 21st century, resulting in fatalities as far away as South Africa.

52
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:14,800
For the modern world, it was a stark reminder of just how frightening the ocean can still be.

53
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:20,160
Tsunamis are the most well known of the extreme wave phenomena lurking out in the open water.

54
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:26,000
The word tsunami is often used interchangeably with tidal wave, although this is a misnomer.

55
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:30,320
While there's no concrete definition for what a tidal wave actually is,

56
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:37,520
the terminology most closely refers to a tidal bore, sizable waves which funnel into narrow tributaries.

57
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:46,000
Unlike tsunamis, which are tectonic in origin, tidal bores are driven by rising tides resulting from the gravitational pull of the moon.

58
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:51,760
And while bores are far less destructive overall, they still have the potential to be deadly.

59
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:59,520
They are most common in waterways with powerful tidal flow, such as the Bay of Fundy, home to the highest tidal range on Earth.

60
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:03,280
One of the most notable bores can be found on the Amazon River.

61
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:09,440
Known by the locals as Pororoca, the strongest tides of the year create a seemingly never-ending wave,

62
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:14,560
one which spawns at the edge of the Atlantic and travels hundreds of miles upstream.

63
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:19,760
Fortunately, tides are predictable enough that they don't tend to cause much harm on their own.

64
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:26,240
However, they become far more threatening when combined with another ocean phenomenon, storm surge.

65
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:31,520
An effect produced when intense winds from a tropical cyclone push the sea inland.

66
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:36,480
Depending on the direction of the wind, orientation of the coast, and strength of the tide,

67
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:39,920
storm surge may produce devastating results.

68
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:46,640
In 2005, Hurricane Katrina triggered a peak storm surge of 27 feet along the Gulf Coast.

69
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:52,320
The widespread flooding would contribute to the costliest damage of any storm in U.S. history.

70
00:06:52,320 --> 00:07:00,800
The highest storm surge on record happened all the way back in 1899, when cyclone Mahina struck Bathurst Bay, Australia.

71
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:08,800
Considered among the most powerful storms to ever make landfall, it summoned an astounding 43 foot tall surge.

72
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:16,640
The scope of the disaster became clear when survivors later discovered numerous sharks and dolphins stranded miles inland.

73
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:22,320
Had it occurred in a more populated area, the results could have been catastrophic.

74
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:29,440
Storm surge along with tidal bores and tsunamis are commonly regarded as the most hazardous nautical events.

75
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:34,640
These three phenomena contribute to by far the greatest quantity of oceanic casualties.

76
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:39,920
However, far out in the distant sea lies a fourth phenomenon,

77
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:42,960
one which is potentially more deadly than all the others.

78
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:53,920
In 1826, French explorer Jules de Ville presented an eyewitness report of a series of waves he encountered in the Indian Ocean.

79
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:59,200
Their estimated height was monumental, believed to be in excess of 100 feet.

80
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:04,320
After hearing the testimony, the scientific community was highly skeptical.

81
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:11,920
The understanding of physics at the time found it impossible for any wave to exceed even a third of the height that de Ville had reported.

82
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:20,320
The concept alone was treated as ludicrous, colossal waves spawning way out in the open water that are magnitudes taller than all the others.

83
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:25,600
It sounded like a fairy tale, and so the matter was almost entirely ignored.

84
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:34,640
That was until 169 years later when the Droppner natural gas platform in the North Sea recorded something unusual.

85
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:42,720
At approximately 3 p.m on January 1st, the platform clocked a passing wave with a maximum height of 84 feet,

86
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:47,040
more than twice as tall as the standard wave height in the surrounding area.

87
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:54,720
The facility was equipped with state-of-the-art instruments, meaning that this time the reliability of the reading was indisputable.

88
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:59,840
All of a sudden, the idea of Jules de Ville's colossal wave was no longer make-believe.

89
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:03,920
The anomaly sparked widespread scientific interest.

90
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:11,360
It fell completely outside of predictive models at the time, prompting a re-evaluation of entire fields of study.

91
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:20,400
The phenomenon would come to be known as rogue waves, which would soon be recognized as the largest open-water waves the Earth is capable of producing.

92
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:26,880
Tsunamis, while formidable near the coast, behave quite differently over deep stretches of ocean.

93
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:31,520
The only other waves that come close are certain kinds of breakers which occur near the shore.

94
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:38,080
These waves are famous for attracting daredevil surfers looking to experience the ride of a lifetime.

95
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:45,760
The most powerful breakers occur in places where the depth of the seafloor rises steeply, forcing the momentum of the water upward.

96
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:53,920
This effect is most noticeable off the coast of Nazaré, Portugal, which sits at the receiving end of an enormous underwater canyon.

97
00:09:53,920 --> 00:10:02,800
It was there in 2020 where Sebastian Stuttner set the record for the tallest wave ever surfed, overcoming an 86-foot behemoth.

98
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:08,320
Spectacles like this offer us a rare reference point to understand the staggering scale of rogue waves.

99
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:13,600
Stuttner's record-setting wave was roughly equivalent in size to the Droppner wave.

100
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:20,720
As far as breakers go, that's about as big as it gets. But when it comes to rogues, we're just getting started.

101
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:26,320
In 2000, the British research vessel Discovery measured a 95-footer.

102
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:31,600
One year later, a pair of Bahamian cruise ships encountered an estimated 98-footer,

103
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:38,720
the tallest observed in the modern day. Historical reports contain testimony of even higher specimens.

104
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:45,520
In 1933, the USS Ramapo triangulated the height of an alleged 112-foot wave,

105
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:49,360
which is perhaps the tallest ever witnessed in open water.

106
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:53,520
Combine the most powerful rogues with the amplifying effects of the coast,

107
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:57,600
and you end up with what are truly the largest waves on the planet.

108
00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:03,520
These elusive titans are rarely ever witnessed. Their true scale has only ever been approximated

109
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:09,360
from chance encounters with a select few lighthouses. In 1985, the fast-knit lighthouse

110
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:16,560
in Ireland was struck by a wave estimated to be in excess of 150 feet. In 1914, a lighthouse

111
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:22,080
keeper at Trinidad Head, California observed one wave pull even with the top of the structure,

112
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:28,480
175 feet above sea level. Potentially the tallest wave on record flooded the Eagle Island

113
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:34,560
lighthouse in 1861. It was powerful enough to smash the window panes on the upper level.

114
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:39,360
For this to be the case, the wave would have had to surmount the 87-foot tower as well as

115
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:47,120
the 133-foot cliff underneath, culminating in an unthinkable 220-foot monster. But believe it or

116
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:52,400
not, there's an even more infamous case of a suspected rogue wave striking a lighthouse.

117
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:58,240
Followers of the macabre may be familiar with the unsolved mystery of the Flannan Isle lighthouse

118
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:04,400
keepers, an incident concerning three watchmen who disappeared without a trace. Since it was

119
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:10,240
first reported in 1900, the disappearance has sparked wild theories as to how a crew of seasoned

120
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:15,840
veterans could meet such an unforeseen demise. Fascinatingly, the recent advancements in

121
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:20,560
understanding rogue waves have provided a plausible solution to the now century-old

122
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:26,320
mystery. Damage found on the western part of the island corroborates an encounter with a mammoth

123
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:32,560
wave, which we now know to be possible. As it turns out, the study of rogue waves has inspired

124
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:38,640
a re-evaluation of numerous other historical incidents, particularly in the forensic analysis

125
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:45,360
of shipwrecks. In 1978, the MS Munchen suffered a catastrophic failure resulting in the total

126
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:51,280
loss of the ship and her crew. The German cargo vessel was considered state-of-the-art at the time,

127
00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:57,840
making its demise highly unusual. It took another 25 years until a rogue wave emerged as the most

128
00:12:57,840 --> 00:13:02,880
plausible cause of the tragedy. A similar conclusion would be reached about the sinking of

129
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:09,360
the MV Derbyshire, the largest British vessel to ever be lost at sea. A closer review of various

130
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:14,480
maritime logs revealed that rogue waves were quite a bit more common than originally thought.

131
00:13:15,280 --> 00:13:20,560
Across the 20th century, numerous voyages had reported run-ins with the phenomenon,

132
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:26,800
including the ill-fated Lusitania. The surprising frequency of encounters raises the question of

133
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:31,600
how it took so long for the matter to be investigated. It's a question which leads

134
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:37,280
to a rather disturbing implication. It would seem that the reason rogue waves were rarely

135
00:13:37,280 --> 00:13:42,080
ever reported was due to how those who saw them almost never lived to tell the tale.

136
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:48,400
With the power to capsize even our modern-day steel vessels, the wooden ships of old hardly

137
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:54,400
stood a chance. Across the history of maritime travel, it's entirely possible that rogue waves

138
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:59,600
may have been the most unsurvivable force that any sailor could encounter. They have likely

139
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:04,960
contributed to countless fatalities that we may never be able to realize. The remarkable

140
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:09,680
difficulty of documenting rogues presents a significant challenge in studying them.

141
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:14,480
They occur so randomly and infrequently in the wild that scientists can sparsely measure them

142
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:19,760
with any sort of reliability. Regardless, the potential risk that rogue waves pose to the

143
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:23,840
shipping industry has maintained a vested interest that they are understood further.

144
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:29,200
Currently, there are numerous theories as to the specific cause of the phenomenon.

145
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:33,280
Some researchers believe the matter to be as simple as constructive interference.

146
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:40,080
Others consider more complex dynamics at play. But until substantial strides in data collection

147
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:44,720
can be achieved, it's unlikely that we will reach any sort of definitive conclusion.

148
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:49,920
Rogue waves, at least for the time being, continue to be quite the enigma.

149
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:55,840
The same could be said for the ocean as a whole, most of which remains vastly unexplored.

150
00:14:56,400 --> 00:15:02,480
After all this time, it still has the uncanny ability to make our imaginations run wild.

151
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:07,360
Despite all of our progress towards mastering the sea, we are constantly reminded that it

152
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:13,520
must not be underestimated. To this day, the ocean persists as a profoundly daunting domain.

153
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:18,160
It stands as a defiant reminder of how much we have yet to understand.

154
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:24,400
At any given moment, only a minuscule fraction of the sea falls within the watchful eyes of man.

155
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:30,160
What lies beyond continues to prevail as one of the last great mysteries of the modern age.

156
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:36,160
It's impossible to know just what else may be lurking out there, waiting to be discovered.

157
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:42,240
The ocean is still full of surprises, some of which may have been hiding in plain sight all along.
