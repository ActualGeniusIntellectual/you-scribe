00:00.000 --> 00:04.000
If you've been around long enough, you've probably encountered this image,

00:04.000 --> 00:09.360
The Great Wave of Kanagawa by Japanese artist Katsushika Hokusai.

00:09.360 --> 00:16.480
From its humble origins in 1831, it has since gone on to become one of the most reproduced paintings in history.

00:16.480 --> 00:22.320
Few other works have managed to captivate our attention with such striking elegance and power.

00:22.320 --> 00:27.040
Due to how closely intertwined Japanese culture is with such events,

00:27.040 --> 00:32.560
many onlookers over the years have assumed that the Great Wave is depicting a tsunami.

00:32.560 --> 00:39.600
However, modern research suggests that Hokusai's illustration may actually feature something entirely different,

00:39.600 --> 00:48.000
a phenomenon which, in some regards, is even more terrifying, one which we have only just begun to understand.

00:48.000 --> 00:53.280
It would seem that mankind has always had a complex relationship with the sea.

00:53.280 --> 00:58.960
For millennia, it was perhaps the single biggest obstruction standing in the way of human progress.

00:58.960 --> 01:02.880
Today, we tend to think of the ocean as a conquered frontier,

01:02.880 --> 01:07.760
a stepping stone in the development of civilization that we overcame long ago.

01:07.760 --> 01:15.360
With that in mind, it's easy to lose sight of just how recently our apparent mastery of maritime travel was achieved.

01:15.360 --> 01:20.400
It's common knowledge that human beings now exist pretty much everywhere on the planet,

01:20.400 --> 01:22.800
but that wasn't always the case.

01:22.800 --> 01:30.720
For the first 90% of our existence, the ocean served as an impassable barrier, restricting us to the Eurasian landmass.

01:30.720 --> 01:37.200
It was only through the onset of Ice Age events when we could access new territory through temporary land bridges.

01:37.200 --> 01:42.000
Islands and especially remote places continued to elude us for millennia.

01:42.000 --> 01:49.760
The prospect of crossing deep water for long distances proved far too daunting until significant strides in watercraft could be made.

01:49.760 --> 01:55.200
It took until 5,000 years ago before the Caribbean islands saw their first inhabitants.

01:55.200 --> 02:02.960
Madagascar was reached just 2,500 years ago and New Zealand only saw its first settlers within the last millennium.

02:02.960 --> 02:07.680
Even then, no one else on the planet had any idea that these places existed.

02:07.680 --> 02:13.600
Only after the advent of maritime trade routes did the true scope of civilization become known.

02:13.600 --> 02:17.920
By the 1500s, man would successfully circumnavigate the globe,

02:17.920 --> 02:21.920
allowing for the creation of the first comprehensive world maps.

02:21.920 --> 02:28.160
When it comes to old maps, it's interesting to watch them gradually start to become more accurate over time.

02:28.160 --> 02:33.680
But what's more interesting is a little detail which began to appear on many of them.

02:33.680 --> 02:41.920
During the Age of Discovery, it was common for some cartographers to include illustrations of sea monsters in the more vast stretches of ocean.

02:41.920 --> 02:48.560
As the number of transcontinental voyages increased, a few ships would never reach their destination.

02:48.560 --> 02:53.680
With no way of knowing what happened to them, our imaginations were left to run wild.

02:53.680 --> 02:59.680
And so, the ocean would earn its reputation as a place of great mystery and mythology.

02:59.680 --> 03:06.320
It was common for seafaring cultures to attribute the cruelty of the ocean to some kind of vengeful deity.

03:06.320 --> 03:13.120
The unknowable vastness of the sea sparked wild speculation of fantastical lands waiting to be discovered.

03:13.120 --> 03:21.920
The fabled island of Atlantis would captivate scholars for centuries as a utopian civilization which tragically sunk beneath the waves.

03:21.920 --> 03:29.200
Equally unverifiable was the lost continent of Mu, rumored to exist between Asia and the Americas.

03:29.200 --> 03:33.760
Others saw the ocean as home to monstrous beings beyond our comprehension.

03:33.760 --> 03:39.120
From the colossal ship-devouring Leviathan to the unsettling temptation of Sirens,

03:39.120 --> 03:46.480
whose irresistible song will lure sailors to their doom, the sea continues to tempt us to this day.

03:46.480 --> 03:54.080
For as long as maritime trade has been logistically viable, the rich and powerful have gravitated towards the water's edge.

03:54.080 --> 04:00.880
In the modern day, waterfront property continues to reign supreme as the most desirable real estate on the planet.

04:00.880 --> 04:06.800
Despite the ocean's adversarial role in our history, we sure do love being near it.

04:06.800 --> 04:11.680
Perhaps it satisfies some latent desire to flirt with the uncontrollable.

04:11.680 --> 04:18.640
It seems like everyone wants to come to the water until all of a sudden, the water starts coming to us.

04:18.640 --> 04:25.040
As many in America have ventured closer to the coast, the Cascade Indians have migrated inland.

04:25.120 --> 04:31.360
Their ancestral wisdom warns of a terrible tragedy for those who fail to respect the power of the sea.

04:31.360 --> 04:34.880
The legend they follow is very much based on a real incident.

04:34.880 --> 04:44.080
The Cascadia tsunami of 1700, an event so destructive that its effects were observed more than 4,500 miles away in Japan.

04:44.080 --> 04:50.080
In recent times, a tsunami of comparable strength occurred in 2004 off the island of Sumatra,

04:50.080 --> 04:55.600
where a magnitude 9.2 earthquake triggered a wall of water up to a hundred feet tall.

04:55.600 --> 05:00.560
Coastlines near the epicenter were inundated as far as two and a half miles inland.

05:00.560 --> 05:08.960
Currently, it stands as the deadliest natural disaster of the 21st century, resulting in fatalities as far away as South Africa.

05:08.960 --> 05:14.800
For the modern world, it was a stark reminder of just how frightening the ocean can still be.

05:14.800 --> 05:20.160
Tsunamis are the most well known of the extreme wave phenomena lurking out in the open water.

05:20.160 --> 05:26.000
The word tsunami is often used interchangeably with tidal wave, although this is a misnomer.

05:26.000 --> 05:30.320
While there's no concrete definition for what a tidal wave actually is,

05:30.320 --> 05:37.520
the terminology most closely refers to a tidal bore, sizable waves which funnel into narrow tributaries.

05:37.520 --> 05:46.000
Unlike tsunamis, which are tectonic in origin, tidal bores are driven by rising tides resulting from the gravitational pull of the moon.

05:46.000 --> 05:51.760
And while bores are far less destructive overall, they still have the potential to be deadly.

05:51.760 --> 05:59.520
They are most common in waterways with powerful tidal flow, such as the Bay of Fundy, home to the highest tidal range on Earth.

05:59.520 --> 06:03.280
One of the most notable bores can be found on the Amazon River.

06:03.280 --> 06:09.440
Known by the locals as Pororoca, the strongest tides of the year create a seemingly never-ending wave,

06:09.440 --> 06:14.560
one which spawns at the edge of the Atlantic and travels hundreds of miles upstream.

06:14.560 --> 06:19.760
Fortunately, tides are predictable enough that they don't tend to cause much harm on their own.

06:19.760 --> 06:26.240
However, they become far more threatening when combined with another ocean phenomenon, storm surge.

06:26.240 --> 06:31.520
An effect produced when intense winds from a tropical cyclone push the sea inland.

06:31.600 --> 06:36.480
Depending on the direction of the wind, orientation of the coast, and strength of the tide,

06:36.480 --> 06:39.920
storm surge may produce devastating results.

06:39.920 --> 06:46.640
In 2005, Hurricane Katrina triggered a peak storm surge of 27 feet along the Gulf Coast.

06:46.640 --> 06:52.320
The widespread flooding would contribute to the costliest damage of any storm in U.S. history.

06:52.320 --> 07:00.800
The highest storm surge on record happened all the way back in 1899, when cyclone Mahina struck Bathurst Bay, Australia.

07:00.800 --> 07:08.800
Considered among the most powerful storms to ever make landfall, it summoned an astounding 43 foot tall surge.

07:08.800 --> 07:16.640
The scope of the disaster became clear when survivors later discovered numerous sharks and dolphins stranded miles inland.

07:16.640 --> 07:22.320
Had it occurred in a more populated area, the results could have been catastrophic.

07:22.320 --> 07:29.440
Storm surge along with tidal bores and tsunamis are commonly regarded as the most hazardous nautical events.

07:29.440 --> 07:34.640
These three phenomena contribute to by far the greatest quantity of oceanic casualties.

07:35.520 --> 07:39.920
However, far out in the distant sea lies a fourth phenomenon,

07:39.920 --> 07:42.960
one which is potentially more deadly than all the others.

07:45.200 --> 07:53.920
In 1826, French explorer Jules de Ville presented an eyewitness report of a series of waves he encountered in the Indian Ocean.

07:53.920 --> 07:59.200
Their estimated height was monumental, believed to be in excess of 100 feet.

07:59.840 --> 08:04.320
After hearing the testimony, the scientific community was highly skeptical.

08:04.320 --> 08:11.920
The understanding of physics at the time found it impossible for any wave to exceed even a third of the height that de Ville had reported.

08:11.920 --> 08:20.320
The concept alone was treated as ludicrous, colossal waves spawning way out in the open water that are magnitudes taller than all the others.

08:20.320 --> 08:25.600
It sounded like a fairy tale, and so the matter was almost entirely ignored.

08:26.320 --> 08:34.640
That was until 169 years later when the Droppner natural gas platform in the North Sea recorded something unusual.

08:34.640 --> 08:42.720
At approximately 3 p.m on January 1st, the platform clocked a passing wave with a maximum height of 84 feet,

08:42.720 --> 08:47.040
more than twice as tall as the standard wave height in the surrounding area.

08:47.040 --> 08:54.720
The facility was equipped with state-of-the-art instruments, meaning that this time the reliability of the reading was indisputable.

08:54.720 --> 08:59.840
All of a sudden, the idea of Jules de Ville's colossal wave was no longer make-believe.

09:00.480 --> 09:03.920
The anomaly sparked widespread scientific interest.

09:03.920 --> 09:11.360
It fell completely outside of predictive models at the time, prompting a re-evaluation of entire fields of study.

09:11.360 --> 09:20.400
The phenomenon would come to be known as rogue waves, which would soon be recognized as the largest open-water waves the Earth is capable of producing.

09:21.040 --> 09:26.880
Tsunamis, while formidable near the coast, behave quite differently over deep stretches of ocean.

09:26.880 --> 09:31.520
The only other waves that come close are certain kinds of breakers which occur near the shore.

09:32.080 --> 09:38.080
These waves are famous for attracting daredevil surfers looking to experience the ride of a lifetime.

09:38.080 --> 09:45.760
The most powerful breakers occur in places where the depth of the seafloor rises steeply, forcing the momentum of the water upward.

09:45.760 --> 09:53.920
This effect is most noticeable off the coast of Nazaré, Portugal, which sits at the receiving end of an enormous underwater canyon.

09:53.920 --> 10:02.800
It was there in 2020 where Sebastian Stuttner set the record for the tallest wave ever surfed, overcoming an 86-foot behemoth.

10:02.800 --> 10:08.320
Spectacles like this offer us a rare reference point to understand the staggering scale of rogue waves.

10:08.960 --> 10:13.600
Stuttner's record-setting wave was roughly equivalent in size to the Droppner wave.

10:14.160 --> 10:20.720
As far as breakers go, that's about as big as it gets. But when it comes to rogues, we're just getting started.

10:21.520 --> 10:26.320
In 2000, the British research vessel Discovery measured a 95-footer.

10:26.320 --> 10:31.600
One year later, a pair of Bahamian cruise ships encountered an estimated 98-footer,

10:31.600 --> 10:38.720
the tallest observed in the modern day. Historical reports contain testimony of even higher specimens.

10:38.720 --> 10:45.520
In 1933, the USS Ramapo triangulated the height of an alleged 112-foot wave,

10:45.520 --> 10:49.360
which is perhaps the tallest ever witnessed in open water.

10:49.360 --> 10:53.520
Combine the most powerful rogues with the amplifying effects of the coast,

10:53.520 --> 10:57.600
and you end up with what are truly the largest waves on the planet.

10:57.600 --> 11:03.520
These elusive titans are rarely ever witnessed. Their true scale has only ever been approximated

11:03.520 --> 11:09.360
from chance encounters with a select few lighthouses. In 1985, the fast-knit lighthouse

11:09.360 --> 11:16.560
in Ireland was struck by a wave estimated to be in excess of 150 feet. In 1914, a lighthouse

11:16.560 --> 11:22.080
keeper at Trinidad Head, California observed one wave pull even with the top of the structure,

11:22.080 --> 11:28.480
175 feet above sea level. Potentially the tallest wave on record flooded the Eagle Island

11:28.480 --> 11:34.560
lighthouse in 1861. It was powerful enough to smash the window panes on the upper level.

11:34.560 --> 11:39.360
For this to be the case, the wave would have had to surmount the 87-foot tower as well as

11:39.360 --> 11:47.120
the 133-foot cliff underneath, culminating in an unthinkable 220-foot monster. But believe it or

11:47.120 --> 11:52.400
not, there's an even more infamous case of a suspected rogue wave striking a lighthouse.

11:53.200 --> 11:58.240
Followers of the macabre may be familiar with the unsolved mystery of the Flannan Isle lighthouse

11:58.240 --> 12:04.400
keepers, an incident concerning three watchmen who disappeared without a trace. Since it was

12:04.400 --> 12:10.240
first reported in 1900, the disappearance has sparked wild theories as to how a crew of seasoned

12:10.240 --> 12:15.840
veterans could meet such an unforeseen demise. Fascinatingly, the recent advancements in

12:15.840 --> 12:20.560
understanding rogue waves have provided a plausible solution to the now century-old

12:20.560 --> 12:26.320
mystery. Damage found on the western part of the island corroborates an encounter with a mammoth

12:26.320 --> 12:32.560
wave, which we now know to be possible. As it turns out, the study of rogue waves has inspired

12:32.560 --> 12:38.640
a re-evaluation of numerous other historical incidents, particularly in the forensic analysis

12:38.640 --> 12:45.360
of shipwrecks. In 1978, the MS Munchen suffered a catastrophic failure resulting in the total

12:45.360 --> 12:51.280
loss of the ship and her crew. The German cargo vessel was considered state-of-the-art at the time,

12:51.280 --> 12:57.840
making its demise highly unusual. It took another 25 years until a rogue wave emerged as the most

12:57.840 --> 13:02.880
plausible cause of the tragedy. A similar conclusion would be reached about the sinking of

13:02.880 --> 13:09.360
the MV Derbyshire, the largest British vessel to ever be lost at sea. A closer review of various

13:09.360 --> 13:14.480
maritime logs revealed that rogue waves were quite a bit more common than originally thought.

13:15.280 --> 13:20.560
Across the 20th century, numerous voyages had reported run-ins with the phenomenon,

13:20.560 --> 13:26.800
including the ill-fated Lusitania. The surprising frequency of encounters raises the question of

13:26.800 --> 13:31.600
how it took so long for the matter to be investigated. It's a question which leads

13:31.600 --> 13:37.280
to a rather disturbing implication. It would seem that the reason rogue waves were rarely

13:37.280 --> 13:42.080
ever reported was due to how those who saw them almost never lived to tell the tale.

13:42.720 --> 13:48.400
With the power to capsize even our modern-day steel vessels, the wooden ships of old hardly

13:48.400 --> 13:54.400
stood a chance. Across the history of maritime travel, it's entirely possible that rogue waves

13:54.400 --> 13:59.600
may have been the most unsurvivable force that any sailor could encounter. They have likely

13:59.600 --> 14:04.960
contributed to countless fatalities that we may never be able to realize. The remarkable

14:04.960 --> 14:09.680
difficulty of documenting rogues presents a significant challenge in studying them.

14:09.680 --> 14:14.480
They occur so randomly and infrequently in the wild that scientists can sparsely measure them

14:14.480 --> 14:19.760
with any sort of reliability. Regardless, the potential risk that rogue waves pose to the

14:19.760 --> 14:23.840
shipping industry has maintained a vested interest that they are understood further.

14:24.560 --> 14:29.200
Currently, there are numerous theories as to the specific cause of the phenomenon.

14:29.200 --> 14:33.280
Some researchers believe the matter to be as simple as constructive interference.

14:33.840 --> 14:40.080
Others consider more complex dynamics at play. But until substantial strides in data collection

14:40.080 --> 14:44.720
can be achieved, it's unlikely that we will reach any sort of definitive conclusion.

14:45.440 --> 14:49.920
Rogue waves, at least for the time being, continue to be quite the enigma.

14:50.480 --> 14:55.840
The same could be said for the ocean as a whole, most of which remains vastly unexplored.

14:56.400 --> 15:02.480
After all this time, it still has the uncanny ability to make our imaginations run wild.

15:02.480 --> 15:07.360
Despite all of our progress towards mastering the sea, we are constantly reminded that it

15:07.360 --> 15:13.520
must not be underestimated. To this day, the ocean persists as a profoundly daunting domain.

15:14.160 --> 15:18.160
It stands as a defiant reminder of how much we have yet to understand.

15:18.880 --> 15:24.400
At any given moment, only a minuscule fraction of the sea falls within the watchful eyes of man.

15:25.040 --> 15:30.160
What lies beyond continues to prevail as one of the last great mysteries of the modern age.

15:30.720 --> 15:36.160
It's impossible to know just what else may be lurking out there, waiting to be discovered.

15:36.160 --> 15:42.240
The ocean is still full of surprises, some of which may have been hiding in plain sight all along.
