0	4000	If you've been around long enough, you've probably encountered this image,
4000	9360	The Great Wave of Kanagawa by Japanese artist Katsushika Hokusai.
9360	16480	From its humble origins in 1831, it has since gone on to become one of the most reproduced paintings in history.
16480	22320	Few other works have managed to captivate our attention with such striking elegance and power.
22320	27040	Due to how closely intertwined Japanese culture is with such events,
27040	32560	many onlookers over the years have assumed that the Great Wave is depicting a tsunami.
32560	39600	However, modern research suggests that Hokusai's illustration may actually feature something entirely different,
39600	48000	a phenomenon which, in some regards, is even more terrifying, one which we have only just begun to understand.
48000	53280	It would seem that mankind has always had a complex relationship with the sea.
53280	58960	For millennia, it was perhaps the single biggest obstruction standing in the way of human progress.
58960	62880	Today, we tend to think of the ocean as a conquered frontier,
62880	67760	a stepping stone in the development of civilization that we overcame long ago.
67760	75360	With that in mind, it's easy to lose sight of just how recently our apparent mastery of maritime travel was achieved.
75360	80400	It's common knowledge that human beings now exist pretty much everywhere on the planet,
80400	82800	but that wasn't always the case.
82800	90720	For the first 90% of our existence, the ocean served as an impassable barrier, restricting us to the Eurasian landmass.
90720	97200	It was only through the onset of Ice Age events when we could access new territory through temporary land bridges.
97200	102000	Islands and especially remote places continued to elude us for millennia.
102000	109760	The prospect of crossing deep water for long distances proved far too daunting until significant strides in watercraft could be made.
109760	115200	It took until 5,000 years ago before the Caribbean islands saw their first inhabitants.
115200	122960	Madagascar was reached just 2,500 years ago and New Zealand only saw its first settlers within the last millennium.
122960	127680	Even then, no one else on the planet had any idea that these places existed.
127680	133600	Only after the advent of maritime trade routes did the true scope of civilization become known.
133600	137920	By the 1500s, man would successfully circumnavigate the globe,
137920	141920	allowing for the creation of the first comprehensive world maps.
141920	148160	When it comes to old maps, it's interesting to watch them gradually start to become more accurate over time.
148160	153680	But what's more interesting is a little detail which began to appear on many of them.
153680	161920	During the Age of Discovery, it was common for some cartographers to include illustrations of sea monsters in the more vast stretches of ocean.
161920	168560	As the number of transcontinental voyages increased, a few ships would never reach their destination.
168560	173680	With no way of knowing what happened to them, our imaginations were left to run wild.
173680	179680	And so, the ocean would earn its reputation as a place of great mystery and mythology.
179680	186320	It was common for seafaring cultures to attribute the cruelty of the ocean to some kind of vengeful deity.
186320	193120	The unknowable vastness of the sea sparked wild speculation of fantastical lands waiting to be discovered.
193120	201920	The fabled island of Atlantis would captivate scholars for centuries as a utopian civilization which tragically sunk beneath the waves.
201920	209200	Equally unverifiable was the lost continent of Mu, rumored to exist between Asia and the Americas.
209200	213760	Others saw the ocean as home to monstrous beings beyond our comprehension.
213760	219120	From the colossal ship-devouring Leviathan to the unsettling temptation of Sirens,
219120	226480	whose irresistible song will lure sailors to their doom, the sea continues to tempt us to this day.
226480	234080	For as long as maritime trade has been logistically viable, the rich and powerful have gravitated towards the water's edge.
234080	240880	In the modern day, waterfront property continues to reign supreme as the most desirable real estate on the planet.
240880	246800	Despite the ocean's adversarial role in our history, we sure do love being near it.
246800	251680	Perhaps it satisfies some latent desire to flirt with the uncontrollable.
251680	258640	It seems like everyone wants to come to the water until all of a sudden, the water starts coming to us.
258640	265040	As many in America have ventured closer to the coast, the Cascade Indians have migrated inland.
265120	271360	Their ancestral wisdom warns of a terrible tragedy for those who fail to respect the power of the sea.
271360	274880	The legend they follow is very much based on a real incident.
274880	284080	The Cascadia tsunami of 1700, an event so destructive that its effects were observed more than 4,500 miles away in Japan.
284080	290080	In recent times, a tsunami of comparable strength occurred in 2004 off the island of Sumatra,
290080	295600	where a magnitude 9.2 earthquake triggered a wall of water up to a hundred feet tall.
295600	300560	Coastlines near the epicenter were inundated as far as two and a half miles inland.
300560	308960	Currently, it stands as the deadliest natural disaster of the 21st century, resulting in fatalities as far away as South Africa.
308960	314800	For the modern world, it was a stark reminder of just how frightening the ocean can still be.
314800	320160	Tsunamis are the most well known of the extreme wave phenomena lurking out in the open water.
320160	326000	The word tsunami is often used interchangeably with tidal wave, although this is a misnomer.
326000	330320	While there's no concrete definition for what a tidal wave actually is,
330320	337520	the terminology most closely refers to a tidal bore, sizable waves which funnel into narrow tributaries.
337520	346000	Unlike tsunamis, which are tectonic in origin, tidal bores are driven by rising tides resulting from the gravitational pull of the moon.
346000	351760	And while bores are far less destructive overall, they still have the potential to be deadly.
351760	359520	They are most common in waterways with powerful tidal flow, such as the Bay of Fundy, home to the highest tidal range on Earth.
359520	363280	One of the most notable bores can be found on the Amazon River.
363280	369440	Known by the locals as Pororoca, the strongest tides of the year create a seemingly never-ending wave,
369440	374560	one which spawns at the edge of the Atlantic and travels hundreds of miles upstream.
374560	379760	Fortunately, tides are predictable enough that they don't tend to cause much harm on their own.
379760	386240	However, they become far more threatening when combined with another ocean phenomenon, storm surge.
386240	391520	An effect produced when intense winds from a tropical cyclone push the sea inland.
391600	396480	Depending on the direction of the wind, orientation of the coast, and strength of the tide,
396480	399920	storm surge may produce devastating results.
399920	406640	In 2005, Hurricane Katrina triggered a peak storm surge of 27 feet along the Gulf Coast.
406640	412320	The widespread flooding would contribute to the costliest damage of any storm in U.S. history.
412320	420800	The highest storm surge on record happened all the way back in 1899, when cyclone Mahina struck Bathurst Bay, Australia.
420800	428800	Considered among the most powerful storms to ever make landfall, it summoned an astounding 43 foot tall surge.
428800	436640	The scope of the disaster became clear when survivors later discovered numerous sharks and dolphins stranded miles inland.
436640	442320	Had it occurred in a more populated area, the results could have been catastrophic.
442320	449440	Storm surge along with tidal bores and tsunamis are commonly regarded as the most hazardous nautical events.
449440	454640	These three phenomena contribute to by far the greatest quantity of oceanic casualties.
455520	459920	However, far out in the distant sea lies a fourth phenomenon,
459920	462960	one which is potentially more deadly than all the others.
465200	473920	In 1826, French explorer Jules de Ville presented an eyewitness report of a series of waves he encountered in the Indian Ocean.
473920	479200	Their estimated height was monumental, believed to be in excess of 100 feet.
479840	484320	After hearing the testimony, the scientific community was highly skeptical.
484320	491920	The understanding of physics at the time found it impossible for any wave to exceed even a third of the height that de Ville had reported.
491920	500320	The concept alone was treated as ludicrous, colossal waves spawning way out in the open water that are magnitudes taller than all the others.
500320	505600	It sounded like a fairy tale, and so the matter was almost entirely ignored.
506320	514640	That was until 169 years later when the Droppner natural gas platform in the North Sea recorded something unusual.
514640	522720	At approximately 3 p.m on January 1st, the platform clocked a passing wave with a maximum height of 84 feet,
522720	527040	more than twice as tall as the standard wave height in the surrounding area.
527040	534720	The facility was equipped with state-of-the-art instruments, meaning that this time the reliability of the reading was indisputable.
534720	539840	All of a sudden, the idea of Jules de Ville's colossal wave was no longer make-believe.
540480	543920	The anomaly sparked widespread scientific interest.
543920	551360	It fell completely outside of predictive models at the time, prompting a re-evaluation of entire fields of study.
551360	560400	The phenomenon would come to be known as rogue waves, which would soon be recognized as the largest open-water waves the Earth is capable of producing.
561040	566880	Tsunamis, while formidable near the coast, behave quite differently over deep stretches of ocean.
566880	571520	The only other waves that come close are certain kinds of breakers which occur near the shore.
572080	578080	These waves are famous for attracting daredevil surfers looking to experience the ride of a lifetime.
578080	585760	The most powerful breakers occur in places where the depth of the seafloor rises steeply, forcing the momentum of the water upward.
585760	593920	This effect is most noticeable off the coast of Nazaré, Portugal, which sits at the receiving end of an enormous underwater canyon.
593920	602800	It was there in 2020 where Sebastian Stuttner set the record for the tallest wave ever surfed, overcoming an 86-foot behemoth.
602800	608320	Spectacles like this offer us a rare reference point to understand the staggering scale of rogue waves.
608960	613600	Stuttner's record-setting wave was roughly equivalent in size to the Droppner wave.
614160	620720	As far as breakers go, that's about as big as it gets. But when it comes to rogues, we're just getting started.
621520	626320	In 2000, the British research vessel Discovery measured a 95-footer.
626320	631600	One year later, a pair of Bahamian cruise ships encountered an estimated 98-footer,
631600	638720	the tallest observed in the modern day. Historical reports contain testimony of even higher specimens.
638720	645520	In 1933, the USS Ramapo triangulated the height of an alleged 112-foot wave,
645520	649360	which is perhaps the tallest ever witnessed in open water.
649360	653520	Combine the most powerful rogues with the amplifying effects of the coast,
653520	657600	and you end up with what are truly the largest waves on the planet.
657600	663520	These elusive titans are rarely ever witnessed. Their true scale has only ever been approximated
663520	669360	from chance encounters with a select few lighthouses. In 1985, the fast-knit lighthouse
669360	676560	in Ireland was struck by a wave estimated to be in excess of 150 feet. In 1914, a lighthouse
676560	682080	keeper at Trinidad Head, California observed one wave pull even with the top of the structure,
682080	688480	175 feet above sea level. Potentially the tallest wave on record flooded the Eagle Island
688480	694560	lighthouse in 1861. It was powerful enough to smash the window panes on the upper level.
694560	699360	For this to be the case, the wave would have had to surmount the 87-foot tower as well as
699360	707120	the 133-foot cliff underneath, culminating in an unthinkable 220-foot monster. But believe it or
707120	712400	not, there's an even more infamous case of a suspected rogue wave striking a lighthouse.
713200	718240	Followers of the macabre may be familiar with the unsolved mystery of the Flannan Isle lighthouse
718240	724400	keepers, an incident concerning three watchmen who disappeared without a trace. Since it was
724400	730240	first reported in 1900, the disappearance has sparked wild theories as to how a crew of seasoned
730240	735840	veterans could meet such an unforeseen demise. Fascinatingly, the recent advancements in
735840	740560	understanding rogue waves have provided a plausible solution to the now century-old
740560	746320	mystery. Damage found on the western part of the island corroborates an encounter with a mammoth
746320	752560	wave, which we now know to be possible. As it turns out, the study of rogue waves has inspired
752560	758640	a re-evaluation of numerous other historical incidents, particularly in the forensic analysis
758640	765360	of shipwrecks. In 1978, the MS Munchen suffered a catastrophic failure resulting in the total
765360	771280	loss of the ship and her crew. The German cargo vessel was considered state-of-the-art at the time,
771280	777840	making its demise highly unusual. It took another 25 years until a rogue wave emerged as the most
777840	782880	plausible cause of the tragedy. A similar conclusion would be reached about the sinking of
782880	789360	the MV Derbyshire, the largest British vessel to ever be lost at sea. A closer review of various
789360	794480	maritime logs revealed that rogue waves were quite a bit more common than originally thought.
795280	800560	Across the 20th century, numerous voyages had reported run-ins with the phenomenon,
800560	806800	including the ill-fated Lusitania. The surprising frequency of encounters raises the question of
806800	811600	how it took so long for the matter to be investigated. It's a question which leads
811600	817280	to a rather disturbing implication. It would seem that the reason rogue waves were rarely
817280	822080	ever reported was due to how those who saw them almost never lived to tell the tale.
822720	828400	With the power to capsize even our modern-day steel vessels, the wooden ships of old hardly
828400	834400	stood a chance. Across the history of maritime travel, it's entirely possible that rogue waves
834400	839600	may have been the most unsurvivable force that any sailor could encounter. They have likely
839600	844960	contributed to countless fatalities that we may never be able to realize. The remarkable
844960	849680	difficulty of documenting rogues presents a significant challenge in studying them.
849680	854480	They occur so randomly and infrequently in the wild that scientists can sparsely measure them
854480	859760	with any sort of reliability. Regardless, the potential risk that rogue waves pose to the
859760	863840	shipping industry has maintained a vested interest that they are understood further.
864560	869200	Currently, there are numerous theories as to the specific cause of the phenomenon.
869200	873280	Some researchers believe the matter to be as simple as constructive interference.
873840	880080	Others consider more complex dynamics at play. But until substantial strides in data collection
880080	884720	can be achieved, it's unlikely that we will reach any sort of definitive conclusion.
885440	889920	Rogue waves, at least for the time being, continue to be quite the enigma.
890480	895840	The same could be said for the ocean as a whole, most of which remains vastly unexplored.
896400	902480	After all this time, it still has the uncanny ability to make our imaginations run wild.
902480	907360	Despite all of our progress towards mastering the sea, we are constantly reminded that it
907360	913520	must not be underestimated. To this day, the ocean persists as a profoundly daunting domain.
914160	918160	It stands as a defiant reminder of how much we have yet to understand.
918880	924400	At any given moment, only a minuscule fraction of the sea falls within the watchful eyes of man.
925040	930160	What lies beyond continues to prevail as one of the last great mysteries of the modern age.
930720	936160	It's impossible to know just what else may be lurking out there, waiting to be discovered.
936160	942240	The ocean is still full of surprises, some of which may have been hiding in plain sight all along.
