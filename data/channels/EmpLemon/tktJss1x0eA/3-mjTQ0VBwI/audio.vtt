00:00.000 --> 00:06.280
Growing up, we get told a lot of legends, but one that's always stuck out to me has been the story of Pandora's Box.

00:09.420 --> 00:14.660
There are numerous religious and spiritual texts which attempt to explain the origin of evil,

00:14.660 --> 00:18.760
the most famous of which can be found in the Bible through the Garden of Eden.

00:19.160 --> 00:26.320
Stories such as these often attribute the fall of man to some sort of wicked being who tempted us into a new sinful reality.

00:26.840 --> 00:32.920
However, the ancient Greeks presented a different interpretation of what really led man to forbidden territory.

00:33.680 --> 00:38.440
Pandora's Box was a box or jar given to Pandora, the first woman on Earth.

00:38.640 --> 00:43.560
The box contained all the evils of the world, such as disease, poverty, and war,

00:43.560 --> 00:47.880
and was accompanied by a warning not to open it under any circumstances.

00:48.400 --> 00:55.160
However, Pandora's curiosity got the better of her, and she opened the box, unleashing all the evils into the world.

00:55.680 --> 01:03.600
The Greek telling of the original sin is rather unique, because it implies that mankind is responsible for its own downfall,

01:03.600 --> 01:06.800
a notion that has only grown more salient over time.

01:07.600 --> 01:14.680
Concerns of man-made doom now pervade our lives more than ever, and are beginning to appear where we least expect them.

01:15.380 --> 01:21.320
The preceding paragraph of voiceover was written by ChatGPT, an AI writing tool

01:21.360 --> 01:25.560
which many suspect will lead to a cascade of unforeseen consequences.

01:25.720 --> 01:30.040
It seems like we are opening a new version of Pandora's Box every day,

01:30.040 --> 01:34.320
and while many may experience this as a distinctly modern dilemma,

01:34.360 --> 01:38.800
it turns out that we've been opening the box for a lot longer than we think.

01:39.160 --> 01:44.280
I suppose you could say that humanity's wayward path began when we departed from the Animal Kingdom.

01:44.800 --> 01:48.520
While we once existed alongside animals as products of nature,

01:48.520 --> 01:56.120
we have since assumed the role of quasi-caretakers, although for centuries, it's hard to say that any care was being taken.

01:56.120 --> 02:01.880
In fact, the natural world had not yet seen a force as ruthlessly destructive as man.

02:02.200 --> 02:08.400
When we put our minds to it, we have the unprecedented ability to single-handedly make other creatures disappear.

02:08.720 --> 02:12.520
Since the advent of human civilization after the end of the last Ice Age,

02:12.960 --> 02:17.440
animals have been going extinct at a rate not seen since the last of the dinosaurs.

02:17.760 --> 02:21.720
While many may attribute this process to our efficient hunting practices,

02:21.720 --> 02:28.240
the main culprit lies in the development of agriculture and the widespread destruction of natural habitats for land clearing.

02:28.560 --> 02:32.800
These damaging practices have resulted in effects which sound almost unfathomable.

02:34.000 --> 02:40.160
At the turn of the 19th century, billions of passenger pigeons blanketed the skies of North America.

02:40.360 --> 02:44.960
Just a hundred and fourteen years later, they had ceased to exist entirely.

02:45.560 --> 02:51.640
The long-term consequences of modern extinction events can be difficult to define on a global scale.

02:52.040 --> 02:59.160
It is primarily through localized ecosystems which we can truly understand the importance of individual species,

02:59.440 --> 03:03.080
a lesson that was taught to us after the removal of the Yellowstone wolves.

03:07.200 --> 03:14.480
One of the most disastrous ecological follies we ever oversaw came about ironically from one of our first attempts at

03:14.840 --> 03:16.720
conservation. In

03:16.720 --> 03:21.120
1872, the US government established the first national park in Yellowstone, Wyoming.

03:21.840 --> 03:27.160
The preserve was intended to provide federal protection of the area's natural resources,

03:27.160 --> 03:33.200
but at a time when our understanding of ecology was still in its infancy, not all nature was treated equally.

03:34.200 --> 03:37.640
Yellowstone happened to be home to an abundant population of gray wolves.

03:38.320 --> 03:45.480
Due to the threat they posed to humans and livestock, early park managers were quick to label the predators as undesirable.

03:45.920 --> 03:50.400
It wasn't long before the Yellowstone wolves were in the crosshairs of a full-scale

03:50.920 --> 03:58.760
eradication campaign. About 50 years after the park's foundation, the entire wolf population had been functionally erased.

03:59.280 --> 04:04.560
Soon after, what was seen as a solution quickly devolved into an even greater problem.

04:04.600 --> 04:09.500
It turns out the wolves were instrumental at keeping the local elk population in check.

04:09.760 --> 04:16.480
With their key predators now absent, the number of elk skyrocketed, resulting in overgrazing of the park's flora.

04:17.000 --> 04:23.020
Acres of forest were no longer allowed to grow as budding saplings were prematurely eaten. The waning

04:23.280 --> 04:27.360
vegetation could no longer anchor the terrain which began to erode away.

04:28.080 --> 04:34.400
Local beavers couldn't find enough wood to build their dams, altering the constitution of the park's rivers and streams.

04:34.800 --> 04:39.420
In their time, the Yellowstone wolves only represented several hundred organisms.

04:39.420 --> 04:43.600
It must have been easy to dismiss their presence as inconsequential.

04:43.880 --> 04:50.060
What we failed to realize is the role they played in a finely tuned equilibrium that persisted for millennia.

04:50.840 --> 04:55.680
Disrupting even a single component was enough to throw the entire ecosystem out of balance.

04:55.880 --> 05:01.800
By the 1990s, the park had fallen into such disarray that a new population of wolves had to be

05:02.040 --> 05:04.540
reintroduced in an attempt to reverse the damages.

05:04.720 --> 05:11.000
The fiasco would serve as a hard lesson that the natural world is often far more complex than we think.

05:11.880 --> 05:18.400
As others would soon discover, adding animals to an ecosystem can be just as destructive as removing them.

05:18.600 --> 05:24.160
In the 1930s, Australian sugar farmers were looking to control the native cane beetle.

05:24.320 --> 05:29.640
Their solution was to introduce the invasive cane toad from the jungles of South America.

05:30.080 --> 05:37.840
Starting with just over a hundred individuals, the Australian cane toad population would eventually balloon to over 200 million.

05:38.160 --> 05:45.040
They now inhabit nearly a quarter of the continent and are actively disrupting other native wildlife on both sides of the food chain.

05:45.840 --> 05:53.200
Adult cane toads secrete deadly toxins from their skin, meaning that not even predators are safe from their hazardous influence.

05:53.560 --> 06:00.400
With no way to limit the population, the toads will likely persist as a constant nuisance into the foreseeable future.

06:00.960 --> 06:05.860
The worst part is, they never had any effect on the beetles they were brought in to stop.

06:06.360 --> 06:11.560
While invasive animals may contribute their fair share of carnage to local ecosystems,

06:12.060 --> 06:15.320
invasive plants have the potential to be even more destructive.

06:15.760 --> 06:22.220
Such is the case with a notorious kudzu vine, which now blankets entire landscapes in the American Southeast.

06:23.180 --> 06:28.100
Originally introduced in the 1870s as an ornamental, the plant would expand aggressively,

06:28.780 --> 06:32.020
rapidly climbing up and over acres of native woodlands.

06:32.100 --> 06:37.720
The vine is so oppressive that it effectively blocks out the sun for all other competing plants,

06:37.980 --> 06:40.860
slowly smothering and killing everything in its path.

06:41.380 --> 06:48.100
Fans of biodiversity should be relieved that kudzu is still mostly limited to the eastern half of the country.

06:48.540 --> 06:55.940
As for the Wild West, they happen to have their own kind of invasive vegetation, one that is already familiar to many of us.

06:56.260 --> 07:00.980
The tumbleweed has long persisted as an iconic symbol of the Western aesthetic.

07:01.060 --> 07:06.740
What many failed to realize, however, is that this peculiar plant is not supposed to be here.

07:07.420 --> 07:13.500
Originating in 1870 from a shipment of Russian flax seeds, the tumbleweed has run roughshod ever since.

07:14.100 --> 07:20.780
Depending on the terrain, they can travel through hundreds of miles of unimpeded wilderness, spreading their seeds along the way.

07:21.220 --> 07:25.840
This creates a mobile threat that is practically impossible to isolate and remove.

07:26.580 --> 07:31.940
Tumbleweeds are very much here to stay, and while they contribute to some rather comedic frustration,

07:31.980 --> 07:37.460
their consequences become much more grim when combined with another common fixture of the West.

07:37.980 --> 07:45.620
In the event that the arid landscape is set ablaze, these unsuspecting plants are suddenly transformed into flaming projectiles,

07:46.180 --> 07:49.060
capable of torching the surrounding area in record time.

07:49.500 --> 07:54.320
It's safe to say that the tumbleweed was probably never meant to exist in America.

07:54.500 --> 07:59.260
It's hard to believe that less than 200 years ago, they weren't even here at all.

07:59.700 --> 08:05.620
The same could be said about Providence Canyon, which is often thought of as a miniature Grand Canyon,

08:05.620 --> 08:12.060
but rather than being forged by nature, this colorful landform can trace its origins back to man-made error.

08:12.660 --> 08:19.580
Starting in the 19th century, a combination of extensive land clearing and poor drainage led to tremendous erosion in an otherwise normal

08:19.900 --> 08:21.900
plot of farmland in the Georgia countryside.

08:22.700 --> 08:29.100
By the 1900s, the subsidence had spawned a gash in the landscape over a hundred feet deep and a mile across.

08:29.940 --> 08:33.540
Today, the canyon exists as an amusing tourist attraction,

08:33.580 --> 08:40.100
but its history serves as a reminder of how even our most simple mistakes have the power to scar the earth itself.

08:40.740 --> 08:45.320
While we have been fortunate to come out of most environmental blunders somewhat unscathed,

08:45.500 --> 08:49.460
we can only ask Mother Nature to take one for the team so often.

08:50.100 --> 08:56.620
Tragically, there is one ecological decision which has likely contributed to more human suffering than any other.

08:56.620 --> 09:01.180
In 1958, Mao Zedong instituted the Four Pests Campaign,

09:01.260 --> 09:04.940
which sought to eradicate unwanted vermin from communist China.

09:05.340 --> 09:10.780
Among the vermin targeted was the sparrow, blamed for disrupting the country's supply of grain.

09:11.300 --> 09:16.260
Over the next two years, the Chinese drove the local sparrow population to near extinction,

09:17.020 --> 09:22.740
going so far as to bang drums for days until the startled birds dropped dead from exhaustion.

09:23.060 --> 09:28.420
After the near total removal of the species, Mao's plan immediately began to backfire.

09:28.620 --> 09:34.060
It turns out that in addition to grain, the sparrows consumed a substantial amount of insects,

09:34.780 --> 09:40.780
particularly locusts. With a major predator out of the picture, the locust population exploded,

09:41.100 --> 09:44.220
resulting in widespread crop failures and food shortages.

09:44.740 --> 09:50.980
After recognizing the severity of the mistake, government officials scrambled to replenish the population,

09:51.060 --> 09:53.060
but the damage was already done.

09:53.340 --> 09:59.620
The decision to exterminate the sparrow was one of several contributing factors of the Great Chinese Famine,

09:59.980 --> 10:03.660
a disaster which led to the deaths of up to 55 million people.

10:04.140 --> 10:07.900
It turns out the leaders of China had a history of tempting fate.

10:08.420 --> 10:13.300
Emperor Qin Shi Huang was notable for unifying China more than 2,000 years ago.

10:13.940 --> 10:18.260
Wanting his reign to last forever, Qin sought out the secret to immortality.

10:18.820 --> 10:25.420
After searching far and wide for the solution, he believed to have found it through an exotic mineral known as cinnabar.

10:25.580 --> 10:33.740
The Emperor spent years drinking the compound by mixing it with his wine, but rather than granting eternal life, it accomplished quite the opposite.

10:34.620 --> 10:37.700
Emperor Qin died prematurely at the age of 49,

10:38.100 --> 10:43.020
most likely from consuming a lethal amount of the element we now know as mercury.

10:43.780 --> 10:47.860
It took us a long time to reach a basic understanding of the chemical world,

10:48.060 --> 10:51.380
an odyssey which led to plenty of mistakes along the way.

10:51.700 --> 10:57.900
We unknowingly interacted with substances like mercury for centuries before discovering their toxic properties.

10:58.460 --> 11:02.820
Mercury in particular causes severe damage to the kidneys, lungs and brain,

11:03.020 --> 11:06.660
with even short-term exposure capable of inducing insanity.

11:07.020 --> 11:10.980
An equally sinister element can be found just one space away from the surface.

11:10.980 --> 11:20.020
Lead. Its chemical symbol is Pb, short for the Latin word plumbum, a name that carries with it a rather disturbing implication.

11:21.020 --> 11:25.860
Plumbum happens to be the root word of plumbing, which is sadly no coincidence.

11:26.220 --> 11:34.100
Due to the soft and malleable properties of lead, it was commonly manufactured in a pipe that delivered drinking water to the Roman people.

11:34.100 --> 11:39.260
When ingested, nearly all lead is trapped within the human body where it remains indefinitely.

11:39.740 --> 11:46.580
Compared to mercury, lead is far less potent. Its detrimental effects on health take much longer to materialize.

11:46.940 --> 11:54.100
Historically, this has allowed the metal to appear deceptively safe, resulting in far greater exposure to the general population.

11:54.620 --> 12:00.740
Now classified as a neurotoxin, lead contamination eventually causes the deterioration of the metal.

12:00.740 --> 12:04.740
Some historians now attribute lead to the sudden collapse of the Roman Empire,

12:05.020 --> 12:10.180
hypothesizing that the leaching of toxins into the population gradually drove them mad.

12:10.740 --> 12:15.220
The frequent industrial use of lead continued all the way into the 20th century,

12:15.620 --> 12:19.980
but didn't reach epidemic proportions until the release of leaded gasoline.

12:20.380 --> 12:27.580
The process of burning tetraethyl lead in combustion engines turned into a major change in the history of the Roman Empire.

12:27.580 --> 12:34.460
The process of burning tetraethyl lead in combustion engines turned the metal into an airborne contaminant through car exhaust.

12:34.980 --> 12:40.140
The chemical became inescapable, effectively poisoning the entire US population.

12:40.700 --> 12:47.500
By 1976, the lead content measured in American blood had risen to more than four times the natural level.

12:47.980 --> 12:53.300
The oil and automobile industries lobbied to keep lead in gasoline for as long as they could,

12:53.380 --> 12:59.740
but eventually, its toxicity was indisputable, and world governments began phasing it out of production.

13:00.180 --> 13:07.940
As leaded fuel was gradually outlawed, what followed was a remarkable trend which illustrated its disturbing effect on the population.

13:08.340 --> 13:14.500
The removal of lead emissions from the environment almost directly correlated with a decrease in violent crime.

13:15.660 --> 13:20.620
Tetraethyl lead was initially developed by chemical engineer Thomas Midgley Jr.,

13:20.980 --> 13:25.180
regarded by many as the single most destructive inventor in human history.

13:25.780 --> 13:30.260
Shockingly, leaded gasoline may not have been the most disastrous part of his legacy.

13:30.980 --> 13:38.220
Midgley was also the father of chlorofluorocarbons, the compound eventually responsible for burning a hole in the ozone layer.

13:38.700 --> 13:46.900
Most people now know this seasonal void over Antarctica as the extent of the damage, but the true influence of CFCs extends much further.

13:47.340 --> 13:50.140
Since its widespread release into the atmosphere,

13:50.140 --> 13:55.820
the chemical has depleted about four percent of the ozone for the entire planet as the

13:55.980 --> 14:00.300
atmospheric layer which shields the surface from harmful ultraviolet radiation.

14:00.300 --> 14:06.700
Its weakening is forecasted to cause an uptick in skin cancer and cataracts for the foreseeable future, and

14:06.940 --> 14:14.780
although CFCs have been mostly phased out, the ozone supply is not expected to fully recover until at least 50 years from now.

14:15.220 --> 14:21.580
The 20th century was truly the point of no return for unleashing a plague of chemicals onto the unsuspecting world.

14:21.940 --> 14:27.940
For decades, highly cancerous PCBs would be recklessly dumped into local water supplies.

14:28.180 --> 14:35.500
A rather egregious offender of such was the Monsanto Chemical Company, which knowingly poisoned the people of Anniston, Alabama.

14:36.260 --> 14:41.780
To this day, the town still has among the highest rates of cancer and birth defects in the nation.

14:42.420 --> 14:46.580
PCBs represented a rather unholy achievement in chemical engineering.

14:46.580 --> 14:52.180
They were one of the first man-made compounds capable of rendering entire places inhospitable.

14:52.540 --> 14:59.380
Even so, they didn't compare to the sheer scope and pervasiveness of another industrial byproduct of the same era,

15:00.060 --> 15:06.820
asbestos. What originated as a naturally occurring mineral quickly began to be used in highly artificial ways.

15:07.140 --> 15:12.220
Its strong insulative properties made the substance an ideal candidate for construction.

15:12.620 --> 15:18.740
By the 1970s, asbestos had become ubiquitous in homes, schools, and hospitals around the world.

15:19.260 --> 15:26.180
It also infiltrated numerous consumer goods, including appliances, cigarettes, makeup, and even baby powder.

15:27.060 --> 15:34.860
Eventually, all who came into contact with the supposed wonder material would soon regret it. When disturbed, asbestos releases long

15:35.260 --> 15:41.620
microscopic fibers which become permanently embedded in lung tissue when inhaled. The substance went on to infect

15:41.860 --> 15:44.740
generations of people with deadly respiratory illness.

15:45.500 --> 15:52.220
Asbestos exposure is attributed to more than a hundred thousand deaths annually. Its lingering presence in pre-existing

15:52.500 --> 15:58.020
infrastructure continues to put people at risk. Long after, most places have banned the stuff entirely.

15:58.420 --> 16:03.780
The most hazardous forms of asbestos have even led to the abandonment of entire towns, as

16:03.940 --> 16:09.980
was the case with Wittenham, Australia, which is set to be totally demolished as of this year.

16:10.780 --> 16:18.220
While there are many contenders, the true title for most hazardous man-made development has to go to another breakthrough of the 20th century,

16:18.780 --> 16:21.740
when humanity crossed over into the nuclear age.

16:22.380 --> 16:29.620
If there was ever something that man was never meant to discover, this was probably it, for it was through splitting the atom

16:29.620 --> 16:32.700
which we inherited unspeakable powers of destruction.

16:33.380 --> 16:39.260
Even in its simplest form, the atomic bomb had already cemented its status as the ultimate weapon, as

16:39.500 --> 16:47.380
if it wasn't enough to convert an entire city to ash in a matter of seconds. Whatever remain would be irradiated from nuclear fallout,

16:47.980 --> 16:53.580
inflicting even more torment on any survivors unlucky enough to wander the hell we left behind.

16:54.140 --> 16:57.500
It took just two of these weapons to coerce immediate

16:57.940 --> 17:02.260
unconditional surrender from the most zealously unbreakable military on the planet.

17:02.340 --> 17:09.420
It was as though we had somehow transcended the abilities of mere mortals, suddenly gaining access to the wrath of gods.

17:09.980 --> 17:14.360
To put it more concisely, we had become Death, Destroyer of Worlds.

17:14.700 --> 17:20.020
This phrase was infamously spoken by the father of the atomic bomb, J. Robert Oppenheimer,

17:20.660 --> 17:29.740
the subject of a highly anticipated biopic releasing this summer. The quotation refers to what ran through his mind at the moment of the Trinity detonation,

17:30.220 --> 17:33.060
mankind's very first glimpse into our nuclear future.

17:34.020 --> 17:41.300
Oppenheimer's rather ambiguous relationship with his creation has since been met with irreverence by some, often to comedic effect.

17:41.540 --> 17:47.260
It's hard to imagine that the architect of a superweapon would feel any sort of sympathy for its victims,

17:47.300 --> 17:52.020
but I'd like to believe that when Oppenheimer said this, he wasn't just thinking about Japanese

17:52.420 --> 17:57.380
civilians. While gazing into the brilliant fireball that was supposed to signal the end of the war,

17:57.420 --> 18:00.540
it's possible that he instead saw the end of everything.

18:02.900 --> 18:04.700
With nuclear weapons,

18:04.700 --> 18:11.020
humanity had indeed inherited the keys to the kingdom. We had unlocked the sobering ability to destroy ourselves.

18:11.660 --> 18:20.180
By the time of Oppenheimer's death in 1967, the world powers had manufactured enough firepower to wipe out most of the population,

18:20.580 --> 18:24.820
a stockpile with the potential to transform any ordinary day into Armageddon.

18:25.500 --> 18:32.220
Considering our reckless track record with far lower stakes, you have to wonder whether such a responsibility would be too much to handle.

18:32.620 --> 18:38.740
Thus far, we have yet to wake up to the nuclear apocalypse, but there have been plenty of very close calls.

18:39.260 --> 18:45.740
Every few decades, another reactor meltdown reminds us of just what kind of power we're dealing with. The most

18:46.100 --> 18:54.020
catastrophic accidents have rendered certain areas uninhabitable for thousands of years, and this was all while we were trying not to hurt anyone.

18:54.380 --> 19:02.220
The Chernobyl exclusion zone, home of the worst nuclear meltdown in history, is estimated to remain irradiated until the year

19:02.940 --> 19:08.740
22,000. By then, the area should finally be safe for people to return, although at this rate,

19:08.740 --> 19:15.500
it's hard to say whether we'll even be around to see it. As of today, nuclear warfare persists as an unmistakable

19:15.820 --> 19:17.620
threat to human existence,

19:17.620 --> 19:21.300
but it's far from the only doomsday scenario of the modern age.

19:21.660 --> 19:29.020
While much of our paranoia remains focused on the outside world, our true demise could just as easily come from the inside.

19:29.700 --> 19:38.460
Although an enormous radioactive mushroom cloud is quite effective at killing people, the same result could be achieved with just a small dose of poison.

19:38.980 --> 19:45.660
As opposed to ordinary chemicals, poisons act far more potently by specifically targeting critical body systems.

19:46.060 --> 19:50.420
Pound for pound, they are among the most efficiently lethal substances known to man.

19:50.820 --> 19:53.060
Perhaps we have come to know them a little too well.

19:53.660 --> 20:00.020
For thousands of years, the Japanese have enjoyed a delicacy called fugu, otherwise known as puffer fish.

20:00.580 --> 20:06.860
Preparing the dish is considered extremely difficult due to the high amount of tetrodotoxin within most of the fish's body.

20:07.740 --> 20:14.140
Improper preparation can easily prove fatal, as even a small amount of the toxin is enough to cause death by asphyxiation.

20:15.140 --> 20:20.580
Despite the variety of far safer food available, some people just really like rolling the dice.

20:22.180 --> 20:29.660
Tetrodotoxin is only about half as toxic as the deadliest man-made poison ever synthesized, a compound by the name of VX.

20:30.460 --> 20:38.420
Originally marketed as a pesticide, its toxicity was so severe that militaries around the world began adopting it for use as a chemical weapon.

20:39.420 --> 20:45.460
Eventually, the substance was understood to be so dangerous that not even world governments felt safe producing it.

20:45.700 --> 20:54.500
As of 2015, more than 98% of the global supply of VX had been destroyed, a greater reduction than the supply of nuclear weapons.

20:54.700 --> 20:58.340
It makes you wonder if we found the toxin to be even more frightening.

20:59.220 --> 21:07.260
While human beings have proven to be incredibly skilled at destruction, the world of poison remains one place where nature still has us beat.

21:07.260 --> 21:15.060
The venom of the box jellyfish and several species of poison dart frogs has been measured as magnitudes more deadly than anything we've created.

21:15.260 --> 21:21.060
The single most poisonous substance ever discovered is produced not by an animal, but bacteria.

21:21.260 --> 21:30.060
Botulinum toxin is the most potent neural agent known to man. A dose of just 75 nanograms is enough to kill the average adult.

21:30.860 --> 21:37.860
It is the key contributor of botulism, a condition which, left untreated, results in total paralysis of the body.

21:38.060 --> 21:43.860
Given all that, you'd think we'd try to avoid it, but remarkably, the opposite is true.

21:44.060 --> 21:51.860
Botulinum toxin is actually one of the most heavily demanded poisons in the world due to a cosmetic procedure better known as Botox.

21:52.060 --> 21:58.860
As was the case with Emperor Qin, we are still searching for eternal youth by ingesting poison.

21:58.860 --> 22:04.660
Bacterial toxins are far from the only microscopic threats that now await us in the modern world.

22:04.860 --> 22:12.660
Urbanization and the advancement of global transportation systems has contributed to the unprecedented spread of infectious disease.

22:12.860 --> 22:18.660
As many are now exhaustively aware, it no longer takes much to start a worldwide pandemic.

22:18.860 --> 22:23.660
The next civilization-altering virus is potentially just a 24-hour plane ride away.

22:23.660 --> 22:27.460
Fortunately, the most contagious viruses tend to be the least deadly.

22:27.660 --> 22:33.460
When it was all said and done, the coronavirus outbreak resulted in just a 1% fatality rate.

22:33.660 --> 22:39.460
For comparison, the 1918 Spanish flu was estimated to have killed up to 10% of the infected.

22:39.660 --> 22:44.460
Anything more lethal and you start to enter the murderer's row of pathology.

22:44.660 --> 22:49.460
What they lack in contagiousness is more than made up for with pure stopping power.

22:49.460 --> 22:57.260
Anthrax, Ebola, and the now eradicated smallpox all have a maximum untreated mortality rate of around 90%.

22:57.460 --> 23:06.260
Rabies has a mortality rate of nearly 100% after its symptoms manifest, with only a few cases of survival ever recorded in history.

23:06.460 --> 23:13.260
At one point in time, all of these diseases would have been a virtual death sentence, but medical science has since come a long way.

23:13.260 --> 23:19.060
Currently, every disease that we're aware of either has a known cure or at least a chance of survival.

23:19.260 --> 23:22.060
Every disease, except one.

23:22.260 --> 23:29.060
In the 1950s, anthropologists discovered an unusual illness affecting the Fore people of Papua New Guinea.

23:29.260 --> 23:35.060
Known by the locals as Kuru, the disease would induce rapid physical and mental deterioration.

23:35.260 --> 23:42.060
For years, its origin was a mystery, until scientists started connecting it to the Fore practice of cannibalism.

23:42.060 --> 23:46.860
In most cultures, the idea of eating human flesh is an extreme taboo.

23:47.060 --> 23:51.860
And as we would soon discover, there's a strong biological reason for that.

23:52.060 --> 23:58.860
Kuru is part of a broader classification of disease called transmissible spongiform encephalopathy.

23:59.060 --> 24:05.860
The condition stems from misshapen protein molecules known as prions, which bind to and corrupt healthy tissue.

24:05.860 --> 24:14.660
Once even a single prion is introduced to the body, it can remain dormant for decades before unleashing an unstoppable cascade of internal damage.

24:14.860 --> 24:19.660
Prion disorders are undetectable, incurable and unsurvivable.

24:19.860 --> 24:25.660
They are transmitted by ingesting the contaminated flesh of the diseased, which is most often brain matter.

24:25.860 --> 24:30.660
So if you want to avoid infection, just stay away from cannibals. Seems simple enough.

24:30.860 --> 24:33.660
But what if that cannibal wasn't human?

24:33.660 --> 24:42.460
In the 20th century, to cope with skyrocketing meat consumption, cattle farmers sought out cost-effective ways to feed their ever-expanding herds.

24:42.660 --> 24:52.460
Eventually, someone came up with the bright idea of mixing the processed remains of dead cows back into the feed, essentially turning the living cows into cannibals.

24:52.660 --> 24:58.460
And with cannibalism came a bovine version of Kuru, which is better known as mad cow disease.

24:58.460 --> 25:04.260
Prions from the tainted beef would work their way up the food chain and into the mouths of unsuspecting people.

25:04.460 --> 25:09.260
Some have called the mad cow outbreak the first truly man-made epidemic.

25:09.460 --> 25:13.260
However, it was far from the first plague to come out of animal agriculture.

25:13.460 --> 25:19.260
In fact, many of the most destructive diseases in history were transmitted to us from livestock.

25:19.460 --> 25:27.260
This circumstance is believed to be the primary reason why European colonization had such a devastating effect on the Native Americans.

25:27.260 --> 25:34.060
The colonists had lived in close proximity to domesticated animals for generations and had grown resistant to their diseases.

25:34.260 --> 25:42.060
The Native Americans, meanwhile, did not, and couldn't stand a chance against the onslaught of ailments from the old world.

25:42.260 --> 25:51.060
Animal-borne diseases have ended civilizations before, but could they do so again, especially versus our modern medical advancements?

25:51.260 --> 25:56.060
Well, it turns out that one advancement may soon force us to take a great step backwards.

25:56.060 --> 26:03.860
The meat industry is an aggressive user of antibiotics, once considered to be a permanent solution to bacterial infections.

26:04.060 --> 26:07.860
In recent times, however, the microbial world has been striking back.

26:08.060 --> 26:13.860
The overuse of antibiotics has counterintuitively made certain strains of bacteria stronger.

26:14.060 --> 26:19.860
The more we apply the medication, the more likely it is for surviving microbes to develop immunity.

26:20.660 --> 26:28.660
As antibiotics continue to be overprescribed to both humans and animals, they run the risk of losing their effectiveness entirely.

26:28.860 --> 26:33.660
Experts have long feared the emergence of a superbug which is impervious to any known treatment.

26:33.860 --> 26:40.660
Such an outbreak would essentially set us back to pre-industrial times where even a small bacterial infection could prove fatal.

26:40.860 --> 26:47.660
This should be especially concerning considering the worst pandemic in history, the bubonic plague, was bacterial.

26:48.460 --> 26:53.460
If a similar resistant strain were to arise, we could be powerless to stop it.

26:53.660 --> 26:56.460
Such a scenario is hardly far-fetched.

26:56.660 --> 27:05.460
Antibiotic-resistant bacteria is already responsible for 700,000 deaths per year, a figure that could rise to 10 million by 2050.

27:05.660 --> 27:13.460
There's a misconception that we have left most of our problems in the past, and that we have somehow grown more capable of solving them in the present.

27:13.460 --> 27:21.260
It's easy to blame the mistakes of older generations on their ignorance, but it would be naive to suggest that our circumstance today is any different.

27:21.460 --> 27:27.260
The truth is that we're still not quite sure how anything we're doing today will affect the future.

27:27.460 --> 27:34.260
All of the biggest man-made problems in history only got that way because they weren't obvious when we introduced them.

27:34.260 --> 27:43.060
In 1986, an event like Cleveland Balloon Fest was seen as harmless and whimsical fun, while many look back on it today with disturbing unease.

27:43.260 --> 27:51.060
Modern concerns of microplastics and the environment have made us reconsider the last 70 years of previously innocuous activities.

27:51.260 --> 27:59.060
As of now, the jury's still out on whether plastic pollution is harmful to human health, but for our sake, we had better hope it's not.

28:00.060 --> 28:05.860
Microplastics have infiltrated every layer of the food chain down to the air, water and soil.

28:06.060 --> 28:13.860
One study suggests that the average person now ingests 5 grams of plastic per week, equivalent to the mass of a credit card.

28:14.060 --> 28:18.860
By 2050, the amount of plastic in the ocean is expected to outweigh the amount of fish.

28:19.060 --> 28:26.860
Ready or not, plastic debris is now a part of our world, and all we can do is cross our fingers that it has no effect on anything.

28:26.860 --> 28:32.660
They said the same thing about asbestos and lead, but surely this time will be the exception.

28:32.860 --> 28:40.660
We are still very much in the age of unforeseen consequences, and these days it feels like the price of progress keeps getting steeper.

28:40.860 --> 28:49.660
Whether it's the chemicals we keep putting into the environment or our own bodies, it's difficult to not feel at least a little anxious for the future.

28:49.860 --> 28:55.660
You have to wonder if we'll ever reach a point where we start creating problems faster than we can fix them.

28:55.660 --> 28:57.460
Maybe we're already there.

28:57.660 --> 29:04.460
An often neglected part of the legend of Pandora's box is what remained in the box after all the evils were released.

29:04.660 --> 29:12.460
The most open-ended part of the story fixates on our interpretation of the Greek word Elpis, most commonly translated as hope.

29:12.660 --> 29:18.460
Scholars disagree on whether the inclusion of hope in the box should be considered a blessing or a curse.

29:18.460 --> 29:28.260
On one hand it can be seen as the ultimate tool to protect ourselves from the rest of the evils, the lone antidote designed to counteract the wickedness that once imprisoned it.

29:28.460 --> 29:38.260
However, a far more pessimistic outlook of the situation sees hope as yet another evil, leading us astray on a path towards salvation that's never coming.

29:38.460 --> 29:47.260
It may be convenient to believe that some time down the line, people way smarter than us will just figure it all out and solve everything.

29:47.260 --> 29:52.060
Perhaps artificial intelligence will come to the rescue or just add to the problem.

29:52.260 --> 29:57.060
Maybe if the Earth gets too polluted we can just evacuate to another world.

29:57.260 --> 30:06.060
Hopefully we can do so before the satellites in orbit disintegrate into a deadly debris field that traps us here with all our mistakes forever.

30:06.260 --> 30:10.060
In many ways that would probably be the most fitting end to our story.

30:11.060 --> 30:17.860
There's a cosmological principle known as the Great Filter which attempts to explain the absence of other intelligent life in the universe.

30:18.060 --> 30:25.860
The hypothesis warns of some inevitable barrier which prevents civilizations from expanding beyond a certain level of complexity.

30:26.060 --> 30:36.860
It's possible that advanced species reach a point where they become too powerful for their own good, where the enormity of their problems far surpasses the capacity of their intellect to solve them.

30:37.860 --> 30:39.660
Are we on our way to getting filtered?

30:39.860 --> 30:45.660
As unpleasant of a thought it may be, the arrow of progress only points in one direction.

30:45.860 --> 30:53.660
If there is an unspeakable catastrophe waiting for us at the end of the line, it's hard to imagine we'd stop ourselves before we get there.

30:53.860 --> 30:56.660
Perhaps that's the lesson of Pandora's Box.

30:56.860 --> 30:59.660
Once it's open, there's no shutting it.

30:59.860 --> 31:03.660
The changes we make to this world are permanent and irreversible.

31:03.660 --> 31:13.460
Despite all of our progress, we are still very much at the mercy of nature, which exists to remind us that everything we have been given can just as easily be taken away.

31:13.660 --> 31:19.460
If we are headed towards the end, may we stand in awe of its totality and finality.

31:19.660 --> 31:25.460
Only then will we truly comprehend our inescapable reality as mortal creatures.

31:25.660 --> 31:32.460
When contemplating the fragility of existence, I am often reminded of a passage I read from a modern day philosopher.

31:32.460 --> 31:39.260
They present the image of a mouse whose curiosity has led to its demise, on which they comment the following.

31:39.460 --> 31:47.260
One day, while doing nothing particularly out of the ordinary, because of natural laws he was completely powerless to understand or intuit,

31:47.460 --> 31:54.260
he was instantly killed in a horrifying way by forces vastly in excess of anything he was ever designed to experience,

31:54.460 --> 31:58.260
for no reason, to no one's particular surprise or upset.

31:58.460 --> 32:01.260
In this, we are more like him than different.

32:32.460 --> 32:39.260
Thank you for watching!
