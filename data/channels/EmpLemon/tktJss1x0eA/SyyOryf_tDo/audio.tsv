0	3440	One of the greatest sports movies ever made is Moneyball,
3440	8720	which is a bit odd considering the film hardly shows any actual sports being played.
8720	13520	In fact, most of the runtime features people shuffling around in the dingy backrooms of an
13520	19680	aging baseball stadium. You see, Moneyball is a film about analytics, a side of sports that not
19680	25520	many fans tend to care about. Some would say that boiling down entire teams and athletes to a series
25520	31680	of statistics removes a lot of the nuance from the game, and a lot of the magic too. But sometimes,
31680	37120	when the stars align, numbers can tell us some of the most interesting stories that sports have to
37120	42960	offer. Moneyball tells the story of the 2002 Oakland Athletics, who rose to the top of the
42960	48400	majors despite having one of the lowest payrolls in the league. Using radical new analytical
48400	52800	strategies, the A's would end up setting the longest winning streak in the history of the
52800	58800	American League. Sometime during the midst of the streak, television cameras capture a fan holding
58800	65280	a sign which I've always found to be absolutely fascinating. We may never lose again. It's just
65280	71360	such an astoundingly brazen thing to say. A notion so preposterous that we almost can't admit it's
71360	76400	true. One that really makes us question the difference between the improbable and the
76400	81760	impossible. This phrase carries with it an unmistakable aura. In a way, it perfectly
81760	87840	captures the indomitable hubris of man versus the uncaring limits of nature. Because while yes,
87840	93760	it is possible for any given team to win every game for the rest of time, such a scenario would
93760	100080	be so astronomically unlikely that it might as well only exist in our imaginations. But hey,
100080	105920	when the mojo starts flowing and the winds start piling up, almost anyone can be led to believe
105920	112400	that they just can't lose. To open the 2023 baseball season, the Tampa Bay Rays got off to
112400	118480	a remarkable start, winning each of their first 11 games. Coincidentally, I happened to be in
118480	123760	town during the streak, so I decided to pop into the next one for a chance at witnessing something
123760	130240	historic. After a tense game, the Rays held on to extend their streak to 12. The next day they
130240	136320	won again to tie the major league record for best ever start to a season. One game after that,
136320	142880	with a chance to stand alone in the record books, the Rays lost, ending their winning streak at 13.
143520	149360	Of course, even this all-time great start was less than 10% of the way to the theoretical perfect
149360	156800	MLB season, which would require winning all 162 regular season games plus 11 or so playoff games.
156800	161360	The greatest teams in the history of the majors could only manage to win about three out of every
161360	166480	four contests, meaning that we probably won't witness an undefeated baseball season before
166480	172080	the heat death of the universe. In the pursuit of perfection, each individual game is another
172080	176800	potential point of failure, meaning that leagues with smaller schedules have better odds at
176800	183200	producing the elusive perfect season. At just over a hundred games, the NBA season is considerably
183200	189840	shorter than baseball's. The best record of any NBA team so far belongs to the 1996 Bulls,
189840	195760	who defeated about nine out of every 10 opponents they faced. The English Premier League features
195760	202400	just 38 matches in a season, bringing its competitors even closer to perfection. In 2018,
202400	209360	Manchester City went undefeated in 36 out of 38 matches. A remarkable feat, but one which reveals
209360	215120	a complication about what we consider to be perfect. Association football features a lot of
215120	222000	draws, an outcome many would call less than ideal. In the hunt for the truly perfect season, it's not
222000	228400	enough to just be undefeated. The road to perfectville must be paved through wins and wins alone.
228400	233760	Unfortunately, the overwhelming likelihood of draws in football push any dreams of perfection
233760	238560	hopelessly out of reach. For a team to have any realistic shot of running the gauntlet,
238560	244720	they'd be far better off in a sport like football, where tie games are few and far between. Perhaps
244720	250720	no other professional sport provides better odds at a perfect season than the NFL. Early iterations
250720	255840	of the league featured just over a dozen games in a season. Teams were knocking on the door of
255840	262720	perfection as far back as 1934, when the Chicago Bears took a 13-0 record into the championship
262720	267920	game. Leading by 10 points heading into the fourth quarter, the Bears historic bid would
267920	273440	be spoiled after the New York Giants scored 27 unanswered points to steal the victory.
273440	278960	Just eight years later, the Bears once again took an undefeated record into the championship game
278960	285360	before falling just short to another underdog opponent. After the 1942 season, it would take
285360	292320	20 years before any other NFL team got as close to perfection. The 1962 Packers finished the year
292320	299120	with a 14-1 record, their lone loss coming from a Thanksgiving Day game versus the Detroit Lions.
299120	304480	By now, the NFL was poised to become one of the preeminent sporting leagues in America.
304480	311120	In 1970, they merged with the rival AFL to truly expand their influence nationwide. The merger
311120	316720	would usher in what many considered to be the NFL's modern era, finally setting the stage for
316720	325840	the stars of our story. By this point, most NFL franchises had decades of history under their belt.
325840	332720	The Miami Dolphins were not one of those teams. Founded in 1966 as an expansion franchise, the
332720	338160	Dolphins were still very much the new kids on the block at the time of the merger. As is the case
338160	343760	with most expansion teams, they had a rough first few seasons, but things would turn around following
343840	349360	the arrival of head coach Don Shula. Under his tenure, the Dolphins quickly rose to the top of
349360	354640	the standings, earning their first playoff berth in 1970 and advancing all the way to the Super
354640	360880	Bowl in 1971. While Shula's squad would fall short to the Dallas Cowboys, they would enter the
360880	371600	following season with a vengeance. The 1972 Dolphins rocketed out of the gates with a 4-0 record.
371600	376880	Their sights set on returning to the Super Bowl. However, in just their fifth game, the young
376880	382640	season was placed in immediate turmoil. Starting quarterback Bob Griese suffered a broken ankle,
382640	388080	forcing him out of action for the foreseeable future. Ordinarily, the loss of any team's most
388080	392880	important position player would be a virtual death sentence, but thanks to coach Shula's
392880	398720	well-rounded roster construction, the Dolphins were able to carry on. Remarkably, the offense was able
398720	403920	to maintain its production behind the strength of its rushing attack. Running backs Larry Zonka
403920	409520	and Mercury Morris would finish the season as the first teammates to each rush for a thousand yards.
409520	415040	Coupled with a surprisingly solid play of 38-year-old backup QB Earl Morrill, the Dolphins
415040	420480	still managed to post the league's number one offense. Arguably more impressive, however, was the
420480	426560	defense, which also finished as the best in the league. For coach Shula, the strategy was simple.
426560	431440	Keep the game close with stingy defense and eventually overwhelm the opponent with steady
431440	436560	offensive pressure. It was far from the most flashy strategy, but in sports you don't play
436560	443120	to be flashy. You play to win. And boy, did the Dolphins win. Following a narrow victory versus
443120	448080	the Bills, the Dolphins were able to dispatch every other team on the schedule, entering the
448080	454320	postseason a perfect 14-0. But despite their white-hot momentum, the team still had plenty
454320	459600	of doubters, with some claiming that they had feasted on weak competition. Regardless, any
459600	463840	questions over the Dolphins' greatness would be answered in the playoffs, where they would have
463840	469440	to face the best teams the league had to offer. Their first test would come against the 10-4
469440	474080	Cleveland Browns. Despite forcing five interceptions out of the Browns' offense,
474080	478880	the Dolphins found themselves trailing late in the fourth quarter. With their perfect season in
478880	484800	jeopardy, the offense came in clutch, driving down the field and scoring the go-ahead touchdown.
484800	490080	The winning play would come at the hands of an unexpected hero, third-string running back Jim
490080	495600	Kick, who would emerge in the playoffs as the Dolphins' X-Factor. After holding off the Browns,
495600	500160	the Dolphins had an even tougher challenge ahead of them, going on the road to face the
500160	506320	Pittsburgh Steelers. Modern NFL fans may be confused as to how an undefeated team was not
506320	511920	given home-field advantage, but back in the early 70s, playoff hosting was actually determined by
511920	517120	an annual rotation, providing yet another unfortunate setback for the Dolphins. Rather
517120	522000	than basking off the temperate shores of Miami Beach, they would have to venture into the frigid
522000	527440	north in the dead of winter, an environment notorious for punishing warm-weather teams.
527440	532960	However, in this regard, the Dolphins caught a huge break, playing their game on an unseasonably
532960	540320	warm day. In many ways, the 1972 AFC Championship was a meeting between two teams of destiny.
540320	545840	The Dolphins, in pursuit of perfection, and the Steelers, fresh off of one of the most improbable
545840	551600	victories the sport had ever seen. Within a matter of hours, one of these fairy tales would come to a
551600	558320	tragic end. After a low-scoring first half, the Dolphins once again fell behind late in the game.
558320	563760	With the offense in desperate need of a spark, Coach Shula made an unexpected decision.
563760	569440	Quarterback Earl Morrill was taken out of the game to make way for the return of Bob Griese.
569440	575120	The change-up disrupted the Steelers' defensive game plan, leading to two quick Miami touchdowns,
575120	579360	giving the Dolphins enough of a cushion to hold on for the rest of the game.
579360	583520	And with that, the perfect season was just one win away.
588320	595920	Awaiting the Dolphins in the Super Bowl were the Washington Redskins, who had just finished
595920	601040	manhandling the defending champion, Dallas Cowboys. Although the Dolphins had overcome
601040	605600	every opponent thus far, many were still skeptical that they could seal the deal.
605600	610960	With some sportsbooks ranking Washington as the odds-on favorites, it's understandable why so
610960	615600	many fans were hesitant to embrace what was happening. Betting on the Dolphins would have
615600	620800	been betting on the unprecedented. Thus far in their brief history, the franchise had hardly
620800	626240	done anything worth remembering. Most people around the country barely knew of their existence.
626240	631440	But soon enough, that would all change. Because on that sunny January afternoon,
631440	635920	the 1972 Dolphins would accomplish something unforgettable.
645600	657440	Welcome to Perfectville, population one. In just their seventh year as a franchise,
657440	662160	the Miami Dolphins achieved the most coveted feat in the 50-year history of the league.
662160	670160	A final record of 17 wins, zero ties, and zero losses. The mythical win percentage of 1,000.
670160	674800	From this point on, the NFL would never be the same. The Dolphins had proven that the
674800	680320	perfect season was possible. And in capturing the Holy Grail, their role had suddenly shifted
680320	686480	from pursuers to protectors. Now that one team had finally broken through to perfection,
686480	690000	the entire sport was left to wonder who was going to get there next.
696400	704000	And so the hunt was on. 32 teams, one destination. From that point forward, they were all chasing the
704000	710160	72 Dolphins. It's somewhat fitting that the NFL's first perfect season happened to coincide with
710160	716000	the rise of Led Zeppelin's hit song, Stairway to Heaven. Throughout 1972, the track had begun to
716000	720960	dominate radio stations across the nation, providing a rather serendipitous soundtrack
720960	726080	to the Dolphins' ascension into the history books. Stairway to Heaven was indeed an accurate
726080	731120	description of the monumental task awaiting the rest of the league. From the start of the season,
731120	736720	each win can be seen as another step closer to the promised land. The stairway is treacherous
736720	742160	and unforgiving, with just one slip-up erasing all of your progress and sending you back to square
742160	748480	one. Every team starts off the year undefeated, but after week one, at least half will be out of
748480	754480	contention. By week two, only about a quarter remain alive. In a typical season, there's usually
754480	760800	only one undefeated team left by around week five, less than halfway through the schedule. Football
760800	765920	is very much governed by chance, with random factors such as weather and injuries providing
765920	772080	substantial variance over long periods of time. On any given Sunday, it's not uncommon for even the
772080	778160	most dominant teams to suffer the occasional fluke loss. Needless to say, replicating the perfect
778160	785600	season would be no easy feat. For the rest of the 70s, few other teams even got close. The 1975
785600	791280	Vikings got off to the best start at 10-0. The best overall season belonged to John Madden's
791280	797680	Raiders, who lost just once during their 1976 championship run. Two years later, the NFL
797680	804160	expanded their regular season from 14 to 16 games, pushing the perfect season just a bit further out
804160	809840	of reach. While future attempts at perfection would be more difficult, succeeding would be even
809840	815360	more impressive. The next perfect season would not just equal the 72 Dolphins, but surpassed
815360	821840	them with a theoretical record of 19-0. After the schedule change, it took a while before another
821840	827200	great run at perfection. The next team to truly challenge the Dolphins was, funnily enough,
827200	833200	the Dolphins. But this iteration of the roster was quite different than the one from 1972.
833200	837280	Rather than controlling games through their bruising defense and rushing attack,
837280	842960	these new-look Dolphins found their success through the air. Because in 1984, the Dolphins
842960	848560	didn't just have a good passing season, they didn't even have a great one. They had the best
848560	854400	statistical passing season since the invention of the forward pass, and it was all made possible by
854400	861200	a 23-year-old from Pittsburgh named Dan Marino. We are seeing another spectacular effort by Marino
861200	867200	who fires. Touchdown! Marino, gunning deep, and Clayton is open for a touchdown. What a
867200	873520	bazooka shot by Marino. One of the more incredible passes I have ever seen. Marino throws deep down
873520	879920	field. It is caught by fire. Touchdown! Touchdown, Dolphins! In the entire history of the quarterback
879920	884800	position, you can make the argument that Dan Marino was the most physically gifted passer
884800	890160	the sport has ever seen. In the modern day game, players like Aaron Rodgers and Patrick Mahomes
890160	895200	have provided quite the spectacle over their elite combination of arm strength and accuracy.
895200	900400	Dan Marino's 1984 season represents what would happen if one of these guys hopped in a time
900400	905920	machine and traveled 35 years into the past. Indeed, Marino resembled a quarterback of the
905920	911200	distant future, with throwing mechanics so quick that television cameras could hardly keep up with
911200	916480	them. In just his sophomore season, he would rewrite the record books for the position. Prior
916480	923680	to 1984, the NFL season record for touchdown passes stood at 36. By season's end, Marino had
923680	930240	pushed the record to 48. This was no incremental improvement. This was like the scene in 2001 A
930240	936320	Space Odyssey that cuts from a bone to a spaceship. The numbers set during Marino's quantum leap would
936320	941840	not be bested until long after he retired, and the players that eventually surpassed him did so
941840	947200	under a ruleset that more heavily favored offensive production. Adjusted for ERA, Marino's
947200	953680	1984 season has to go down as the most impressive in history. Naturally, it contributed to a lot of
953680	960960	wins as well. The 84 Dolphins would be the first team since the 72 squad to reach the 11-0 mark.
960960	966320	Unfortunately, their perfect season would come to an end just one week later after an overtime loss
966320	972400	to the Chargers. They would finish the regular season with a 14-2 record, one win back of the
972400	979200	San Francisco 49ers, who posted the NFL's first 15-1 season. The two teams would end up meeting
979200	985680	in the Super Bowl, where San Francisco's superior defense kept Marino's arm in check. The 49ers
985680	991280	handed the Dolphins a crushing defeat, and adding insult to injury, surpassed the win total of the
991280	997600	72 team. Although the Niners fell just short of the perfect 19-0, they had proven that it was a
997600	1002960	lot closer than what many may have thought. Despite the sour end of the season, the future looked
1002960	1008320	bright in Miami. Behind their veteran coach and transcendent young quarterback, it seemed like
1008320	1013760	the sky was the limit. But this is the point where our story takes a turn for the strange.
1013760	1018640	While Dolphin fans were looking into the future, they should have taken more time to savor the
1018640	1025040	present. Because as of today, 1984 would mark the last season Shula, Marino, or the Dolphins
1025040	1031920	franchise would ever reach the Super Bowl. 1984 would also mark the retirement of Bob Kuchenberg,
1031920	1038720	the last active member of the 1972 roster. And with that, the NFL's first perfect team had entirely
1038720	1045280	exited the sport, or so we thought. Looking back now, many are convinced that the 72 Dolphins never
1045280	1050960	fully left. Over the years, a mysterious pattern has developed involving teams who get a little
1050960	1056080	too close to perfection, one that began immediately after the 1984 season.
1064800	1069440	After already surviving one threat to their legacy, the Dolphins would have to contend
1069440	1076160	with an even greater one in 1985, a franchise that was no stranger to chasing perfection.
1076160	1082240	50 years after their original undefeated run, the Chicago Bears had returned to finish the job.
1082240	1088480	By December, they had shot out to a 12-0 record, anchored by the most feared defensive unit in NFL
1088480	1094160	history. By this point, the Bears looked downright unstoppable, defeating their last three opponents
1094160	1100880	by a combined score of 104-3. If any team was meant to finish the year with a perfect record,
1100880	1106880	this was surely the one. But before they could do so, they would have to pay a visit to Miami to face
1106880	1111920	the Dolphins on Monday Night Football. For the first time, the Dolphins had the opportunity to
1111920	1118720	defend their own legacy. And with the prestige of the 72 team on the line, they went out and played ball.
1124160	1137280	Touchdown. Moreno. Cooper. Davenport. Into the end zone easily.
1140640	1146240	Moreno gets the pressure, but he gets it to Matt Moore. Hysteria here in the Orange Bowl.
1147120	1152880	Against their last six opponents, the Bears' defense had only allowed a total of 29 points.
1152880	1158560	On this night, the Dolphins had scored more than that by halftime. All season long, the Bears had
1158560	1163360	snuffed out pretty much every quarterback they faced, but they had yet to face a quarterback like
1163360	1168960	Moreno. The 46 defense relied on collapsing the line of scrimmage before the offense even had a
1168960	1174480	chance to throw, but Moreno had such a quick release that he could consistently beat out the pressure.
1174480	1179440	Despite how overpowered the scheme had been for the rest of the season, it had one critical
1179440	1184960	weakness in its pass coverage, a weakness that Shula and Moreno exposed in front of the largest
1184960	1190400	televised audience in Monday Night Football history. But by far the most influential audience
1190400	1195680	of the night was the one live in attendance at the Orange Bowl, the venue responsible for much of the
1195680	1201040	Dolphins' early success. Back in the day, it was well known as one of the loudest stadiums in the
1201040	1206480	sport due to how close the bleachers were to the field. In football lore, there's a term known as
1206480	1212720	the 12th man describing how a unified sea of fans can be just as powerful as an extra man on the
1212720	1218240	field. On that night, the Dolphins faithful delivered what truly was their finest hour.
1218240	1223520	During one sequence in the third quarter, they are going absolutely ballistic. The stadium is
1223520	1229440	so deafening that the Bears offense can't even hear their own snap count. The partisan crowd
1230320	1234160	noisy to the point that the Bears cannot hear their offensive signals.
1234960	1240160	For a long time, the Dolphins were the only professional sports team in the entire state.
1240160	1245520	Eight days a year, the Orange Bowl transformed from an ordinary ballpark to the pantheon of the
1245520	1251200	Florida man. It goes without saying that strange things tend to happen here. No matter how good the
1251200	1256960	Bears were, they never really stood a chance. It just wasn't their night. It's a good thing the
1256960	1261920	Dolphins stopped them when they did because after this game, the Bears steamrolled everyone else for
1261920	1267920	the rest of the season, winning the championship with a record of 18-1. While many fans were
1267920	1273360	eager to see the two teams square off once more in the Super Bowl, the Dolphins never made it.
1273360	1277840	The highly anticipated rematch would be thwarted by the New England Patriots,
1277840	1284880	a team that will come up again later on in our story. After the 85 season, the quest for
1284880	1290800	perfection died down for the rest of the decade. The 1990 season featured a unique scenario in
1290800	1297120	which two teams reached the 10-0 mark. However, as if their fates were intertwined, both ended up
1297120	1303200	losing the following week. After an 11-0 start by Washington the next season, the hunt died down
1303200	1309040	again for many more years. Oddly enough, the Dolphins spent a couple more seasons as the last
1309040	1314720	undefeated team, which was a testament to their winning culture at the time. However, after the
1314720	1321920	1995 season, the organization would experience its biggest shake-up yet when Don Shula finally called
1321920	1328800	it quits. He retired as the winningest coach in NFL history. By this point, Shula basically was the
1328800	1334560	Dolphins. He had been there for every milestone the franchise had accomplished and his departure
1334560	1342080	finally severed the link between the team's past and present. 1997 marked 25 years since the perfect
1342080	1348880	season. Maybe it was finally time to let it go. The following year, it would once again be put to the test.
1351760	1358000	The 1998 season was dominated by two juggernauts, starting with the defending champion Denver
1358000	1364160	Broncos, who became the first team in a quarter century to reach 13-0. With just three games
1364160	1369200	left in the regular season, the Broncos entered their next contest as two touchdown favorites
1369200	1375520	versus the mediocre New York Giants. However, the Broncos offense sputtered all day and with less
1375520	1381040	than a minute left, the Giants scored the game-winning touchdown to end Denver's bid of perfection.
1381040	1387120	In the NFL, there's no such thing as a guaranteed win. Even the bottom feeders of the league must not
1387120	1393040	be underestimated. The perfect season requires near flawless execution each and every week.
1393040	1398640	Any complacency can be punished from the most unlikely of sources. It turns out the Broncos
1398640	1404800	were not done being punished. After losing their perfect record, they had to travel to Miami to face
1404800	1410800	Dan Marino on Monday Night Football. As was the case with the 85 Bears, the Dolphins handed the
1410800	1416720	NFL's strongest team their worst loss of the season. Just six weeks later, the Broncos would
1416720	1422560	return to the very same stadium and capture their second consecutive Super Bowl. It was almost like
1422560	1427760	their loss to the Dolphins was some rite of passage, as if relinquishing part of their record
1427760	1433600	helped appease the spirits of football past, granting them a safe voyage through the postseason.
1433600	1439680	Denver's second loss left them with the second best record in the league behind the 15-1 Minnesota
1439680	1446000	Vikings, a team that got closer than any other to the first 16-0 regular season. A three-point
1446000	1451920	loss in week nine was the only thing keeping them out of the record books. Remarkably, the 98 Vikings
1451920	1457280	were flirting with perfection in more ways than one. Their kicker Gary Anderson had not missed a
1457280	1463360	field goal all year. Thus far in the entire history of the league, no kicker had ever achieved a
1463360	1468880	perfectly accurate season. Thanks to Anderson's automatic leg, the Vikings looked to be on a
1468880	1474960	collision course with the Broncos. However, when the team needed him most, with a trip to the Super
1474960	1481680	Bowl on the line, he missed. The Vikings never made it to Miami. Some would say they had a little
1481680	1488160	too much perfection to handle. The Dolphins record had survived yet again, and as the millennium came
1488160	1494800	to a close, so too did the career of Dan Marino. He retired as the all-time leader in pretty much
1494800	1500960	every passing stat imaginable, but despite all he accomplished, he was nonetheless haunted by his own
1500960	1506480	imperfection. After all those years, the Dolphins front office could never surround Marino with a
1506480	1511600	good enough supporting cast to compete for a championship. He walked away from the game as
1511600	1517520	arguably the best player to never win a Super Bowl ring. It's fascinating to think that by the end of
1517520	1522960	the 90s, the Dolphins franchise had showcased possibly the best coach and best quarterback in
1522960	1528720	the history of the league, yet both were seemingly overshadowed by this increasingly distant record.
1528720	1534480	The longer it stood, the more the legend around it grew. Around this time, a rumor began circulating
1534480	1540080	that after every season's last unbeaten team loses its perfect record, the surviving members
1540080	1546720	of the 72 Dolphins celebrate by toasting champagne. Their presence still loomed over the league like
1546720	1552640	some sort of defined specter. It was like the game had progressed to the future, but this relic from
1552640	1558640	the past would not allow itself to be left behind. As the years went on, the league-wide failure to
1558640	1564160	replicate the perfect season only made teams want it more, and it wasn't long before the Dolphins'
1564160	1573760	record was under siege once again. The 2000s would bring plenty of more challengers to the throne,
1573760	1580560	starting with the 04 Steelers, who became just the fourth team to post a 15-1 regular season.
1580560	1585840	Rookie quarterback Ben Roethlisberger led them on a 14-game winning streak to end the year.
1585840	1590720	However, much like the 98 Vikings, the Steelers would fall short in the playoffs,
1590720	1595840	suffering a convincing defeat to the Patriots. Despite Roethlisberger's impressive rookie
1595840	1601120	campaign, much of the headlines throughout the season would be dominated by another quarterback.
1601120	1607280	2004 was a breakout season for Peyton Manning, who became the first player to surpass Dan Marino's
1607280	1612720	single-season touchdown record. The year after, he had his sights set on another record.
1612720	1618480	The 2005 Colts looked like the team to beat all season long. Their high-powered passing attack
1618480	1624400	carried them all the way to a 13-0 record. But just like the 98 Broncos, Manning and the Colts
1624400	1630640	would lose their next two games, finishing the regular season at 14-2. However, unlike the
1630640	1636160	Broncos, the Colts would not be blessed with playoff success. Despite being overwhelming
1636160	1642080	championship favorites, their season would end in disastrous fashion. Down by just three points in
1642080	1648080	the final seconds, the Colts needed to make a 46-yard field goal to tie the game. Lining up for
1648080	1653680	the attempt was Mike VanderJagt, who by this point was the most accurate kicker in NFL history.
1653680	1659120	Thus far in his playoff career, he hasn't missed a kick on the Colts' home turf. In any other
1659120	1664000	circumstance, things would have probably turned out differently, but these Colts had challenged
1664000	1676560	perfection and the Ghosts had unfinished business. Despite the brutal defeat, Manning and the Colts
1676560	1682960	hadn't given up on chasing perfection. In 2006, they got off to a far more modest 9-0 start
1682960	1688800	before losing four of their last seven games. Oddly enough, the added adversities seemed to work in
1688800	1693680	their favor as this Colts team marched through the playoffs to score the city of Indianapolis
1693680	1699200	their first Super Bowl victory. The championship seemed to corroborate a paradoxical trend among
1699200	1704640	the NFL's contenders. For the past few years, teams with worse records were having better
1704640	1710000	success in the playoffs. It was almost as if to give yourself better odds of winning the title,
1710000	1715840	it was advantageous to lose more during the regular season. This idea would be revisited by
1715840	1722000	the 2009 Colts, who found themselves with a third opportunity at a perfect season and to raise the
1722000	1728800	stakes even higher. This time, they had company. 2009 was just the second season in recent history
1728800	1734480	that saw two teams reach the 10-0 mark. The New Orleans Saints had joined the Colts in the pursuit
1734480	1742080	of perfection and both teams just kept on winning. Their records climbed to 11-12, then 13-0 before
1742080	1748560	the Saints finally conceded a defeat. Once again, the Colts stood unopposed as the last remaining
1748560	1753920	perfect team. The following week, they looked poised to advance to 15-0 while leading the
1753920	1759200	Jets late in the third quarter. It was then when coach Jim Caldwell did the unthinkable.
1764080	1770160	Peyton Manning has his helmet on. For the first time all season, someone other than Peyton Manning
1770160	1774960	will take the snap at quarterback for the Indianapolis Colts. The painter is the number
1774960	1782240	two quarterback. Lost the football. It's loose. Inside the five-yard line, the Jets cover for the
1782240	1797200	touchdown. After already securing home field advantage in the playoffs, the Colts decided to
1797200	1802880	bench their starters for the remainder of the game. For the first and only time in league history,
1802880	1808480	a team had intentionally sabotaged its own perfect season. The decision would prove highly
1808480	1813920	controversial. The moment Peyton Manning was taken out of the game, the fans in attendance rained
1813920	1819520	down thunderous boos. Many of them couldn't believe what they were watching. The Colts had rested
1819520	1824880	their starters before, but never with a perfect season on the line. The coaching staff remained
1824880	1830000	steadfast in their reasoning, saying that winning the championship was the ultimate goal and that
1830000	1835200	preserving the health of their star players was imperative to that goal, even if it meant
1835200	1840880	sacrificing a perfect record. At the end of the day, an undefeated season is theoretically
1840880	1846800	insignificant. It doesn't offer any additional rewards or advantages versus any other champion.
1846800	1851600	The objective of NFL football is to hoist the Lombardi Trophy at the end of the season,
1851600	1856560	and however you manage to get there should be irrelevant. The perfect season is just bragging
1856560	1861840	rights. It's a nice thing to have. An amusing little factoid for geeks on the internet to
1861840	1868640	romanticize in the unknowable future. But beyond all that, does it really, truly matter? Well,
1868640	1873200	to answer that question, you have to look no further than the expressions of the fans and
1873200	1878800	players watching their run come to a bitter end. You can say what you want to justify what happened,
1878800	1884480	but it clearly mattered to them. Six weeks later, the Colts would lose the Super Bowl,
1884480	1889520	and their undefeated season was sacrificed for nothing. They were beaten by the Saints,
1889520	1895360	who had surrendered their perfect record fair and square. Their season came to an end in Miami,
1895360	1900080	meaning that the ghosts may have played a hand in it. Perhaps they didn't want to leave the Colts
1900080	1904960	with any excuses to entertain the thought that they could have been perfect if they had simply
1904960	1911040	chosen to. If a team was truly meant to be perfect, the results would be unmistakable.
1911040	1914880	We cannot choose perfection any more than we can choose our destiny.
1917040	1923120	And so, the Dolphins perfect season had survived its most competitive decade yet. Despite facing
1923120	1928640	more challengers than ever, no other team could manage to top them. The next 10 years would see
1928640	1934720	the pursuit of perfection slow down considerably. But they still produced a few worthy adversaries,
1934720	1940880	the first of which were the 2011 Packers, who started the year 13-0 before being upset by the
1941280	1946080	5-8 Chiefs. After the loss, the Packers followed in the footsteps of the Colts by
1946080	1951760	resting their starters, a decision that, once again, backfired. After dominating all year
1951760	1957120	with their historically great offense, the Packers' stars ran cold in the postseason.
1957120	1962960	They earned the dubious distinction of becoming the first 15-1 team that failed to win a single
1962960	1969680	playoff game. The 2015 season featured what remains to this day as the last great run at
1969680	1975440	perfection. The Carolina Panthers got off to the rare 14-0 start before inexplicably
1975440	1981840	falling to the Atlanta Falcons, a team they had beaten 38-0 just two weeks earlier. The Panthers
1981840	1986560	would go on to the Super Bowl where they would lose to our old friend Peyton Manning. Although
1986560	1992480	he never got his perfect season, he was able to retire on top. As for the Panthers, they only
1992480	1998640	continued the futility of 15-1 teams in the postseason. As of today, they are the last NFL
1998640	2004320	roster to finish the regular season with just one loss. Since then, no one else has really come
2004320	2010880	close to the perfect season, and the legacy of the 72 Dolphins lives on. However, many of you
2010880	2015840	watching have probably noticed that I haven't told the full story, and that's because I've been
2015840	2022080	saving the best for last. Over all this time, many teams have tried and failed to replicate the
2022080	2030000	perfect season, but there is one that got closer than any other. The market's in an itsy-bitsy
2030000	2035280	little gully right now. It's like everybody said, okay that was crazy, let's just all calm down.
2039680	2045280	By the mid-2000s, the Dolphins had fallen on hard times. For the past several years,
2045280	2050720	South Florida had been battered by hurricanes, which only served to punctuate the gloomy outlook
2050720	2056160	for the future of the organization. Ever since Marino and Shula retired, the Dolphins had
2056160	2061040	struggled to find any quarterback or coach that had the makings of a worthy successor.
2061040	2067120	Meanwhile, the franchise that had was their longtime divisional foes, the New England Patriots.
2067120	2072000	As the Dolphins sunk into dysfunction and instability, the Patriots had assembled the most
2072000	2078160	ferocious dynasty the league had ever known. This team was no ordinary juggernaut. It was far more
2078160	2084080	diabolical than that. Facing the Patriots during this time was like staring down the Death Star.
2084080	2088400	They were a team designed to crush the hopes and dreams of the rest of the league.
2088400	2095760	And for Dolphins fans, no season felt more hopeless than 2007. In August of that year,
2095760	2102000	the city of Miami began the process of demolishing the Orange Bowl. The Dolphins had relocated to a
2102000	2108640	new stadium long ago, and the site had fallen into disrepair. Ever since the departure, the team was
2108640	2114080	never really the same. It seemed like the franchise had left part of their heart and soul in that old
2114080	2119680	venue. The Orange Bowl was still very much the spiritual center of the Miami Dolphins, especially
2119680	2126160	the 1972 team. By erasing such a historic place, it's almost like they were asking for trouble.
2126160	2136400	Applying the last lick from the Patriots, our final score 49-28, New England.
2138800	2143920	Immediately after, the Dolphins got off to the most miserable start in franchise history.
2143920	2149360	By the halfway point in the season, they had failed to win a single game. Their three best
2149360	2154640	offensive players had suffered season-ending injuries, leaving their game plan in a disarray.
2154640	2159680	The Dolphins had no other choice but to conduct their offense through quarterback Cleo Lemon,
2159680	2165920	a player who never started another meaningful game before or since. To make matters even worse,
2165920	2171680	their arch rivals were headed in the polar opposite direction. The 2007 Patriots were on
2171680	2176480	track to become the greatest team in history, featuring the most disgustingly unfair
2176480	2181840	amassment of talent that will likely ever exist on an NFL roster. At the center of it all was
2181840	2187520	newcomer Randy Moss, a top five receiver of all time, teaming up with franchise cornerstone Tom
2187520	2193120	Brady, the single greatest quarterback of all time. They didn't just start the year undefeated.
2193120	2198480	No one even came close to defeating them. Plenty of other teams through the years have challenged
2198480	2204080	perfection, but these Patriots were different. It wasn't enough to simply win. They had to do so
2204080	2209680	with such extreme prejudice. Before long, it was clear that this team had only one destination in
2209680	2214640	mind. A championship wasn't enough. They were aiming for something even greater.
2218160	2224400	By December, the Patriots still hadn't lost, and the Dolphins still hadn't won. The sky was
2224400	2230400	falling in Miami, and the ghosts were nowhere to be seen. For the Dolphins' faithful, the grim
2230400	2236000	reality was starting to set in. Not only were the Patriots closing in on the ultimate triumph,
2236000	2239920	but the Dolphins were on the verge of the ultimate humiliation.
2239920	2246640	Since the advent of the 16-game schedule, no NFL team had ever gone winless. In a cruel twist of
2246640	2252000	fate, the franchise renowned for the NFL's most prestigious achievement was now in danger of
2252000	2259040	inheriting its most shameful. 0-16, the mark of the Banished Prince, a scar from which they could
2259040	2265360	never recover. With just three games left to play, it was starting to look like destiny. At that
2265360	2275520	point, they had precisely one opportunity to save themselves. Their next matchup came against the
2275520	2280960	struggling Baltimore Ravens, by far the most winnable game remaining on the schedule. If the
2280960	2286480	Dolphins can't pull out a victory here, they're not going to have another chance. After two quarters
2286480	2292640	of offensive ineptitude, they enter the half trailing 13-3. In attendance for the halftime
2292640	2298800	ceremony are the members of the 1972 team, who are being honored for the 35-year anniversary of
2298800	2304480	their grand accomplishment. Their presence signals one of two things. Either the Dolphins have found
2304480	2310960	their salvation, or this really is the end, and the ghosts are just here to say goodbye to the legacy
2310960	2316640	they built all those years ago. Perhaps sensing the gravity of the situation, Miami's players
2316640	2322080	emerged from the locker room with purpose. As the pride of the franchise rested on their shoulders,
2322080	2327840	the Dolphins rallied back to tie the game, and eventually take the lead. All they had to do now
2327840	2334000	was hold off the Ravens for two minutes. However, after a bad kickoff, Baltimore drove all the way
2334000	2339680	down the field. In the final seconds, they get the ball just one foot away from the end zone,
2339680	2345360	but rather than trying for the go-ahead touchdown, the Ravens elect to play it safe and kick a field
2345360	2351600	goal, sending the game to overtime. Luck is not on the Dolphins' side as the Ravens get the ball
2351600	2357520	first, forcing Miami's exhausted defense back on the field. Baltimore marches all the way into
2357520	2363280	scoring position, where they can end the game with a 44-yard field goal. This season, the Dolphins
2363280	2369280	have lost six games by just a three-point margin, and it's about to happen again. A series of
2369280	2374160	individual bad breaks have now snowballed into the nightmare they currently inhabit.
2374160	2380640	The stadium has fallen mostly silent. Deep down, everyone is expecting this kick to go in, including
2380640	2386800	Dolphins color commentator Jim Mandich. He was there during the franchise's finest hour, and now
2386800	2393040	he's arrived at its darkest. It's been a long season, and he's preparing to sink into the abyss.
2393040	2395760	What happens next, though, springs him back to life.
2396560	2412160	And just like that, the Dolphins have a chance. If the offense can just find any sort of magic,
2412160	2416880	they can still come out of this thing in one piece. However, for a unit that has struggled
2416880	2424000	mightily all season, the end zone feels so very far away. 35 years ago, the Dolphins were on their way
2424000	2429520	to being immortalized in the record books. Now, these Dolphins are fighting for the right to be
2429520	2435200	forgotten. Way back at the end of Super Bowl VII, embedded within their crowning achievement was
2435200	2441040	another embarrassing episode that has been mostly lost to time. At the end of the game, kicker Gero
2441040	2445760	Yapremian committed one of the most atrocious bloopers in the history of organized sports.
2446320	2452000	It's fascinating to consider that the NFL's perfect team was somehow responsible for its single
2452000	2457360	worst play. Maybe it was their gift to the universe to prove the age-old wisdom that no one
2457360	2464080	is truly perfect. 35 years later, the universe would repay the favor. As for a single moment,
2464080	2467520	the NFL's worst team was blessed with the perfect play.
2482000	2490000	Unbelievable! Unbelievable! The Dolphins have done it! They have won this football!
2490000	2494320	Take us out of the history book! We're not going in for that one, baby!
2495040	2500160	The 07 Dolphins may have narrowly avoided catastrophe, but they weren't out of the woods
2500160	2505440	yet. While they were spared from going down as the worst ever, their legacy was still very
2505440	2512080	much in jeopardy. The following week, the 01 and 13 Dolphins traveled to Foxboro to face the 14 and
2512080	2517840	0 Patriots. They entered the game as 22-point underdogs, one of the biggest point spreads in
2517840	2523840	history. However, the Dolphins have overcome the odds before when it came to defending their honor.
2523840	2528720	Could the worst version of the Dolphins really pull off the upset versus the best version of
2528720	2535120	the Patriots? Well, as amusing as that may have been, even I have to admit that the idea was a
2535120	2541680	little too far-fetched. And so, the Patriots were just one game away from the first undefeated
2541680	2547760	regular season in the 16-game era. The only team left standing in their way was the 10 and 5 New
2547760	2553280	York Giants. By this point, both teams had locked up their respective playoff spots, meaning that
2553280	2559200	they each had the opportunity to rest their starters. However, understanding what was at stake,
2559200	2564560	everyone showed up to play. For a moment, it looked like the Patriots had found their kryptonite
2564560	2570240	as the Giants entered the fourth quarter with the lead. But Brady and Moss could not be stopped as
2570240	2576960	the Patriots rallied back to win. They had arrived at the elusive 16 and 0, just three postseason
2576960	2582480	victories away from perfection. Dolphins fans and the rest of the league held their breath as the
2582480	2589040	Patriots inched closer and closer. The Jaguars put up a valiant effort but were ultimately no match.
2589040	2595520	The fabled 17 and 0 record, which stood alone for so long, had been equaled. In the AFC
2595520	2601440	Championship, the Chargers held the Pats offense to just 21 points, but it still wasn't enough to
2601440	2608720	stop them. For the first time in NFL history, a team had reached 18 and 0. The 72 Dolphins had
2608720	2614400	been surpassed. This Patriots team may have held nearly every single accolade the league kept track
2614400	2620880	of, but they still weren't perfect. Awaiting them in Super Bowl 42 was their final opponent.
2620880	2626320	In a twist no one saw coming, the only team left standing in their way was, once again,
2626320	2631680	the New York Giants. It would be the first Super Bowl appearance for the other Manning brother.
2631680	2637600	While Peyton could never quite find perfection, Eli could do the next best thing by preventing it.
2637600	2643120	The Giants entered the game as one of the biggest underdogs in Super Bowl history. Nobody expected
2643120	2647520	them to get there in the first place, and now that they did, they had to face what was already
2647520	2653280	being crowned as the best team ever. But despite the overwhelming task in front of these Giants,
2653280	2659040	they knew that the pressure was on the Patriots. After how far they'd come, this was a game they
2659040	2665120	could not lose. Sometimes it pays to be the underdog. You have nothing to do but go out
2665120	2670960	and shock the world. The game was a tense defensive struggle. For the first three quarters,
2670960	2677120	the score remained deadlocked at 7-3. With just 10 minutes left, the Giants finally broke through
2677120	2682320	to take the lead. It looked like the nerves were really getting to the Patriots, as they were on
2682320	2687120	the verge of losing everything they had worked for. With their backs against the wall, Brady
2687120	2692480	led a touchdown drive to retake the lead with less than three minutes to play. If the defense could
2692480	2698400	stop the Giants from marching 83 yards down the field, then perfection was theirs. Thus far,
2698400	2703520	the Patriots have experienced good fortune all season, but their luck was about to change,
2703520	2709200	because after biding their time until the last possible opportunity, the ghosts had finally come
2709200	2715360	out to play. Early in the drive, the Patriots have a chance to end the game by stopping the Giants on
2715360	2721520	fourth and one. Running back Brandon Jacobs just barely converts, and the game continues. On the
2721520	2727840	next play, Manning gets hammered by a defender, but he hangs on to the ball, and the game continues.
2727840	2733520	The play after that, Manning misses badly on a throw, sending the ball straight towards defender
2733520	2740240	Ahsante Samuel. The ball bounces off his fingertips, and the game continues. The Giants had now dodged
2740240	2746080	a bullet on three consecutive plays, but it's the next one which turns this sequence from lucky
2746080	2752240	to downright supernatural. Manning drops back to throw and is immediately smothered by the defense.
2752240	2757200	Somehow he escapes. Eli heaves the ball towards receiver David Tyree,
2757200	2761200	who after this game will never catch another pass for the rest of his career.
2776480	2781200	What just transpired may have been the most unlikely series of events to ever happen in
2781200	2787440	a single NFL play, and it occurred at the direct expense of a team 60 seconds away from a perfect
2787440	2792640	season. In this moment, it finally dawned on the Patriots that after all this time,
2792640	2798800	they weren't the team of destiny. Four plays later, the Giants scored the game-winning touchdown.
2798800	2803600	Many considered a Giants victory to be unthinkable, but if you've been following along,
2803600	2808000	you may have noticed that they've been doing this kind of thing since the very beginning.
2808080	2813360	The final seconds of the game featured Tom Brady desperately chucking the ball downfield to Randy
2813360	2818720	Moss, a play that had worked so many times for them during the season. This time, however,
2818720	2824160	it just isn't meant to be. The Patriots had made it to the very doorstep of perfectville.
2824160	2830240	They kept knocking and knocking, but no one was there to answer. The 2007 Patriots finished with
2830240	2836160	an 18-1 record, choking away perfection in the final minute of the final game. They had come
2836160	2842160	the closest of anybody and were therefore condemned to the very worst fate. Many years
2842160	2847760	later, Tom Brady retired as by far the greatest quarterback to ever play the game. He ended up
2847760	2853280	throwing for over a hundred thousand yards, an unfathomable amount. He played the most,
2853280	2859280	did the most, and won the most. He was the absolute best athlete that anyone could have asked for,
2859280	2866400	but he wasn't perfect. Since 1972, no one is.
2877440	2883600	In the summer of 2013, the undefeated Dolphins received an unexpected invitation. President
2883600	2888880	Obama had welcomed them to the White House. Ordinarily, this honor is reserved for reigning
2888880	2894240	champions of American sports, but by this point the squad had become so legendary that it was
2894240	2900160	worth the exception. In their time, the NFL just didn't matter as much as it does today,
2900160	2905920	and the team never received a proper ovation. This was possibly because then President Richard
2905920	2912400	Nixon, a Redskins fan, evidently didn't feel like celebrating. Despite the snub, the players never
2912400	2918160	thought much of it. What's funny to consider is that the 72 Dolphins probably never realized just
2918160	2922960	how big of a deal their accomplishment would end up being. It's fair to say that no other
2922960	2931920	team in American sports has remained so relevant for so long. 2022 marked 50 years since the perfect
2931920	2939760	season. By now, the NFL's 16-game era has come and gone with no team ever reaching the elusive 19-0.
2939760	2946400	As of today, the bar to clear is now 20-0 after the league expanded its regular season to 17 games
2946400	2952080	in 2021. And with talks of an 18-game schedule on the horizon, it's looking more and more
2952080	2958640	improbable that anyone else can get to perfectville. And so the obvious question remains, will anyone
2958640	2964400	ever break the Dolphins' record? However, I think the far more interesting question to be asked is
2964400	2970480	whether we want to see it happen. When it aired, more viewers tuned into Super Bowl 42 than any
2970480	2976880	other game in American history. People are fascinated by perfection. To witness it is akin to
2976880	2982960	encountering a pristine oasis in a vast, barren wasteland. The human condition is defined by
2982960	2989040	imperfection. Modern existence is utterly inundated with mediocrity and dysfunction. And while you may
2989040	2994320	think this would only intensify our appetite for perfect things, it turns out that people seem to
2994320	3000800	prefer the contrary. Because as the Patriots were closing in on 19 and 0, most of us were rooting
3000800	3006320	for them to lose. The same is true whenever any team gets a little too far in the season without
3006320	3012240	a defeat. In fact, preying on the downfall of the last undefeated team has become somewhat of an
3012240	3018720	annual tradition. The NFL has already seen one perfect record. And for most fans, that's enough.
3018720	3023120	It's been around for so long now that it's hard to imagine the game without it.
3023120	3028240	So many illustrious teams have failed in their quest to reproduce it that any others pursuing
3028240	3034960	it today just feel unworthy. But surely, after enough time passes, a new challenger is bound to
3034960	3041040	come along and give the ghosts a run for their money. So far this season, the 2023 Dolphins won't
3041040	3046640	finish the year perfect, but they did manage to make some history of their own. The ultra-rare
3046640	3052960	70-point game, a milestone that no team had accomplished since the dark ages of the sport,
3052960	3057760	a feat so alien to the modern football world that it doesn't look right on our present-day
3057760	3063760	scoreboards. After all this time, the Dolphins still have the uncanny ability to captivate us
3063760	3069360	by making numbers go up. At the end of the game, they had the opportunity to run up the score even
3069360	3075920	higher and tie the all-time record of 73. However, while on the cusp of what could have been its most
3075920	3082080	defining career achievement, coach Mike McDaniel ordered his team to stand down. When asked about
3082080	3089760	it afterwards, he explained that it was a matter of karma. The modern NFL is more data-driven than
3089760	3095600	ever before. Every measurable statistic is tracked and analyzed to give teams any sort of edge over
3095600	3101680	the competition. McDaniel himself is considered one of the most brilliant strategic minds in the game,
3101680	3106640	and yet plenty of the league's most important historic decisions are still governed by
3106640	3114400	superstition. And that's called karma, and I'm trying to keep good karma with the Miami Dolphins.
3115040	3122880	By now, everyone knows that bad things happen when you try to pass 72. Hi, I'm Don Shula. I like to
3122880	3128720	watch movies. I've seen this next one quite a few times already, but you know something? I don't
3128720	3134480	think I'll ever get tired of seeing you. They say that records are meant to be broken. It stands to
3134480	3140240	reason that somewhere down the line, one fortunate team will eventually join the perfect Dolphins on
3140240	3146480	the mountaintop. However, there is a realistic possibility that no one ever gets there again,
3146480	3151040	and that the perfect season is that much more special than anyone could have imagined.
3151040	3156640	If that's the case, then the 72 Dolphins may have stumbled upon something that defies everything we
3156640	3164000	know about sports. They own a title that they may truly never lose again. The legend continues, and
3164000	3169760	until anyone else can complete the journey up the stairway, the NFL's only perfect team will be
3169760	3176800	waiting and watching. As the years go by, these select few men have nothing else to do but savor
3176800	3182560	the moment. Many of them are no longer with us. It's entirely possible that their defining
3182560	3187840	achievement will outlive them all. If there really is a team of ghosts haunting the league from the
3187840	3194080	other side, it's just gonna keep getting stronger. Someday, not too long from now, they'll all be
3194080	3199680	reunited for the final time, and when that happens, I hope they remember to bring champagne.
3212720	3218960	We're always in control, and when you say Miami, you're talking Super Bowl, cause we're the
3218960	3228400	Miami Dolphins, Miami Dolphins, Miami Dolphins number one. Yes, we're the Miami Dolphins,
3228400	3233680	Miami Dolphins, Miami Dolphins number one.
