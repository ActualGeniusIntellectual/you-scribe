1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,440
One of the greatest sports movies ever made is Moneyball,

2
00:00:03,440 --> 00:00:08,720
which is a bit odd considering the film hardly shows any actual sports being played.

3
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:13,520
In fact, most of the runtime features people shuffling around in the dingy backrooms of an

4
00:00:13,520 --> 00:00:19,680
aging baseball stadium. You see, Moneyball is a film about analytics, a side of sports that not

5
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:25,520
many fans tend to care about. Some would say that boiling down entire teams and athletes to a series

6
00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:31,680
of statistics removes a lot of the nuance from the game, and a lot of the magic too. But sometimes,

7
00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:37,120
when the stars align, numbers can tell us some of the most interesting stories that sports have to

8
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:42,960
offer. Moneyball tells the story of the 2002 Oakland Athletics, who rose to the top of the

9
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:48,400
majors despite having one of the lowest payrolls in the league. Using radical new analytical

10
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:52,800
strategies, the A's would end up setting the longest winning streak in the history of the

11
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:58,800
American League. Sometime during the midst of the streak, television cameras capture a fan holding

12
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:05,280
a sign which I've always found to be absolutely fascinating. We may never lose again. It's just

13
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:11,360
such an astoundingly brazen thing to say. A notion so preposterous that we almost can't admit it's

14
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:16,400
true. One that really makes us question the difference between the improbable and the

15
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:21,760
impossible. This phrase carries with it an unmistakable aura. In a way, it perfectly

16
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:27,840
captures the indomitable hubris of man versus the uncaring limits of nature. Because while yes,

17
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:33,760
it is possible for any given team to win every game for the rest of time, such a scenario would

18
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:40,080
be so astronomically unlikely that it might as well only exist in our imaginations. But hey,

19
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:45,920
when the mojo starts flowing and the winds start piling up, almost anyone can be led to believe

20
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:52,400
that they just can't lose. To open the 2023 baseball season, the Tampa Bay Rays got off to

21
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:58,480
a remarkable start, winning each of their first 11 games. Coincidentally, I happened to be in

22
00:01:58,480 --> 00:02:03,760
town during the streak, so I decided to pop into the next one for a chance at witnessing something

23
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:10,240
historic. After a tense game, the Rays held on to extend their streak to 12. The next day they

24
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:16,320
won again to tie the major league record for best ever start to a season. One game after that,

25
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:22,880
with a chance to stand alone in the record books, the Rays lost, ending their winning streak at 13.

26
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:29,360
Of course, even this all-time great start was less than 10% of the way to the theoretical perfect

27
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:36,800
MLB season, which would require winning all 162 regular season games plus 11 or so playoff games.

28
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:41,360
The greatest teams in the history of the majors could only manage to win about three out of every

29
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:46,480
four contests, meaning that we probably won't witness an undefeated baseball season before

30
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:52,080
the heat death of the universe. In the pursuit of perfection, each individual game is another

31
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:56,800
potential point of failure, meaning that leagues with smaller schedules have better odds at

32
00:02:56,800 --> 00:03:03,200
producing the elusive perfect season. At just over a hundred games, the NBA season is considerably

33
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:09,840
shorter than baseball's. The best record of any NBA team so far belongs to the 1996 Bulls,

34
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:15,760
who defeated about nine out of every 10 opponents they faced. The English Premier League features

35
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:22,400
just 38 matches in a season, bringing its competitors even closer to perfection. In 2018,

36
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:29,360
Manchester City went undefeated in 36 out of 38 matches. A remarkable feat, but one which reveals

37
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:35,120
a complication about what we consider to be perfect. Association football features a lot of

38
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:42,000
draws, an outcome many would call less than ideal. In the hunt for the truly perfect season, it's not

39
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:48,400
enough to just be undefeated. The road to perfectville must be paved through wins and wins alone.

40
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:53,760
Unfortunately, the overwhelming likelihood of draws in football push any dreams of perfection

41
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:58,560
hopelessly out of reach. For a team to have any realistic shot of running the gauntlet,

42
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:04,720
they'd be far better off in a sport like football, where tie games are few and far between. Perhaps

43
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:10,720
no other professional sport provides better odds at a perfect season than the NFL. Early iterations

44
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:15,840
of the league featured just over a dozen games in a season. Teams were knocking on the door of

45
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:22,720
perfection as far back as 1934, when the Chicago Bears took a 13-0 record into the championship

46
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:27,920
game. Leading by 10 points heading into the fourth quarter, the Bears historic bid would

47
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:33,440
be spoiled after the New York Giants scored 27 unanswered points to steal the victory.

48
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:38,960
Just eight years later, the Bears once again took an undefeated record into the championship game

49
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:45,360
before falling just short to another underdog opponent. After the 1942 season, it would take

50
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:52,320
20 years before any other NFL team got as close to perfection. The 1962 Packers finished the year

51
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:59,120
with a 14-1 record, their lone loss coming from a Thanksgiving Day game versus the Detroit Lions.

52
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:04,480
By now, the NFL was poised to become one of the preeminent sporting leagues in America.

53
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:11,120
In 1970, they merged with the rival AFL to truly expand their influence nationwide. The merger

54
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:16,720
would usher in what many considered to be the NFL's modern era, finally setting the stage for

55
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:25,840
the stars of our story. By this point, most NFL franchises had decades of history under their belt.

56
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:32,720
The Miami Dolphins were not one of those teams. Founded in 1966 as an expansion franchise, the

57
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:38,160
Dolphins were still very much the new kids on the block at the time of the merger. As is the case

58
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:43,760
with most expansion teams, they had a rough first few seasons, but things would turn around following

59
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:49,360
the arrival of head coach Don Shula. Under his tenure, the Dolphins quickly rose to the top of

60
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:54,640
the standings, earning their first playoff berth in 1970 and advancing all the way to the Super

61
00:05:54,640 --> 00:06:00,880
Bowl in 1971. While Shula's squad would fall short to the Dallas Cowboys, they would enter the

62
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:11,600
following season with a vengeance. The 1972 Dolphins rocketed out of the gates with a 4-0 record.

63
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:16,880
Their sights set on returning to the Super Bowl. However, in just their fifth game, the young

64
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:22,640
season was placed in immediate turmoil. Starting quarterback Bob Griese suffered a broken ankle,

65
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:28,080
forcing him out of action for the foreseeable future. Ordinarily, the loss of any team's most

66
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:32,880
important position player would be a virtual death sentence, but thanks to coach Shula's

67
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:38,720
well-rounded roster construction, the Dolphins were able to carry on. Remarkably, the offense was able

68
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:43,920
to maintain its production behind the strength of its rushing attack. Running backs Larry Zonka

69
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:49,520
and Mercury Morris would finish the season as the first teammates to each rush for a thousand yards.

70
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:55,040
Coupled with a surprisingly solid play of 38-year-old backup QB Earl Morrill, the Dolphins

71
00:06:55,040 --> 00:07:00,480
still managed to post the league's number one offense. Arguably more impressive, however, was the

72
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:06,560
defense, which also finished as the best in the league. For coach Shula, the strategy was simple.

73
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:11,440
Keep the game close with stingy defense and eventually overwhelm the opponent with steady

74
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:16,560
offensive pressure. It was far from the most flashy strategy, but in sports you don't play

75
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:23,120
to be flashy. You play to win. And boy, did the Dolphins win. Following a narrow victory versus

76
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:28,080
the Bills, the Dolphins were able to dispatch every other team on the schedule, entering the

77
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:34,320
postseason a perfect 14-0. But despite their white-hot momentum, the team still had plenty

78
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:39,600
of doubters, with some claiming that they had feasted on weak competition. Regardless, any

79
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:43,840
questions over the Dolphins' greatness would be answered in the playoffs, where they would have

80
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:49,440
to face the best teams the league had to offer. Their first test would come against the 10-4

81
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:54,080
Cleveland Browns. Despite forcing five interceptions out of the Browns' offense,

82
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:58,880
the Dolphins found themselves trailing late in the fourth quarter. With their perfect season in

83
00:07:58,880 --> 00:08:04,800
jeopardy, the offense came in clutch, driving down the field and scoring the go-ahead touchdown.

84
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:10,080
The winning play would come at the hands of an unexpected hero, third-string running back Jim

85
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:15,600
Kick, who would emerge in the playoffs as the Dolphins' X-Factor. After holding off the Browns,

86
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:20,160
the Dolphins had an even tougher challenge ahead of them, going on the road to face the

87
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:26,320
Pittsburgh Steelers. Modern NFL fans may be confused as to how an undefeated team was not

88
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:31,920
given home-field advantage, but back in the early 70s, playoff hosting was actually determined by

89
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:37,120
an annual rotation, providing yet another unfortunate setback for the Dolphins. Rather

90
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:42,000
than basking off the temperate shores of Miami Beach, they would have to venture into the frigid

91
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:47,440
north in the dead of winter, an environment notorious for punishing warm-weather teams.

92
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:52,960
However, in this regard, the Dolphins caught a huge break, playing their game on an unseasonably

93
00:08:52,960 --> 00:09:00,320
warm day. In many ways, the 1972 AFC Championship was a meeting between two teams of destiny.

94
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:05,840
The Dolphins, in pursuit of perfection, and the Steelers, fresh off of one of the most improbable

95
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:11,600
victories the sport had ever seen. Within a matter of hours, one of these fairy tales would come to a

96
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:18,320
tragic end. After a low-scoring first half, the Dolphins once again fell behind late in the game.

97
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:23,760
With the offense in desperate need of a spark, Coach Shula made an unexpected decision.

98
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:29,440
Quarterback Earl Morrill was taken out of the game to make way for the return of Bob Griese.

99
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:35,120
The change-up disrupted the Steelers' defensive game plan, leading to two quick Miami touchdowns,

100
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:39,360
giving the Dolphins enough of a cushion to hold on for the rest of the game.

101
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:43,520
And with that, the perfect season was just one win away.

102
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:55,920
Awaiting the Dolphins in the Super Bowl were the Washington Redskins, who had just finished

103
00:09:55,920 --> 00:10:01,040
manhandling the defending champion, Dallas Cowboys. Although the Dolphins had overcome

104
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:05,600
every opponent thus far, many were still skeptical that they could seal the deal.

105
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:10,960
With some sportsbooks ranking Washington as the odds-on favorites, it's understandable why so

106
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:15,600
many fans were hesitant to embrace what was happening. Betting on the Dolphins would have

107
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:20,800
been betting on the unprecedented. Thus far in their brief history, the franchise had hardly

108
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:26,240
done anything worth remembering. Most people around the country barely knew of their existence.

109
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:31,440
But soon enough, that would all change. Because on that sunny January afternoon,

110
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:35,920
the 1972 Dolphins would accomplish something unforgettable.

111
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:57,440
Welcome to Perfectville, population one. In just their seventh year as a franchise,

112
00:10:57,440 --> 00:11:02,160
the Miami Dolphins achieved the most coveted feat in the 50-year history of the league.

113
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:10,160
A final record of 17 wins, zero ties, and zero losses. The mythical win percentage of 1,000.

114
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:14,800
From this point on, the NFL would never be the same. The Dolphins had proven that the

115
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:20,320
perfect season was possible. And in capturing the Holy Grail, their role had suddenly shifted

116
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:26,480
from pursuers to protectors. Now that one team had finally broken through to perfection,

117
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:30,000
the entire sport was left to wonder who was going to get there next.

118
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:44,000
And so the hunt was on. 32 teams, one destination. From that point forward, they were all chasing the

119
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:50,160
72 Dolphins. It's somewhat fitting that the NFL's first perfect season happened to coincide with

120
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:56,000
the rise of Led Zeppelin's hit song, Stairway to Heaven. Throughout 1972, the track had begun to

121
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:00,960
dominate radio stations across the nation, providing a rather serendipitous soundtrack

122
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:06,080
to the Dolphins' ascension into the history books. Stairway to Heaven was indeed an accurate

123
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:11,120
description of the monumental task awaiting the rest of the league. From the start of the season,

124
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:16,720
each win can be seen as another step closer to the promised land. The stairway is treacherous

125
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:22,160
and unforgiving, with just one slip-up erasing all of your progress and sending you back to square

126
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:28,480
one. Every team starts off the year undefeated, but after week one, at least half will be out of

127
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:34,480
contention. By week two, only about a quarter remain alive. In a typical season, there's usually

128
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:40,800
only one undefeated team left by around week five, less than halfway through the schedule. Football

129
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:45,920
is very much governed by chance, with random factors such as weather and injuries providing

130
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:52,080
substantial variance over long periods of time. On any given Sunday, it's not uncommon for even the

131
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:58,160
most dominant teams to suffer the occasional fluke loss. Needless to say, replicating the perfect

132
00:12:58,160 --> 00:13:05,600
season would be no easy feat. For the rest of the 70s, few other teams even got close. The 1975

133
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:11,280
Vikings got off to the best start at 10-0. The best overall season belonged to John Madden's

134
00:13:11,280 --> 00:13:17,680
Raiders, who lost just once during their 1976 championship run. Two years later, the NFL

135
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:24,160
expanded their regular season from 14 to 16 games, pushing the perfect season just a bit further out

136
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:29,840
of reach. While future attempts at perfection would be more difficult, succeeding would be even

137
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:35,360
more impressive. The next perfect season would not just equal the 72 Dolphins, but surpassed

138
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:41,840
them with a theoretical record of 19-0. After the schedule change, it took a while before another

139
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:47,200
great run at perfection. The next team to truly challenge the Dolphins was, funnily enough,

140
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:53,200
the Dolphins. But this iteration of the roster was quite different than the one from 1972.

141
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:57,280
Rather than controlling games through their bruising defense and rushing attack,

142
00:13:57,280 --> 00:14:02,960
these new-look Dolphins found their success through the air. Because in 1984, the Dolphins

143
00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:08,560
didn't just have a good passing season, they didn't even have a great one. They had the best

144
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:14,400
statistical passing season since the invention of the forward pass, and it was all made possible by

145
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:21,200
a 23-year-old from Pittsburgh named Dan Marino. We are seeing another spectacular effort by Marino

146
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:27,200
who fires. Touchdown! Marino, gunning deep, and Clayton is open for a touchdown. What a

147
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:33,520
bazooka shot by Marino. One of the more incredible passes I have ever seen. Marino throws deep down

148
00:14:33,520 --> 00:14:39,920
field. It is caught by fire. Touchdown! Touchdown, Dolphins! In the entire history of the quarterback

149
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:44,800
position, you can make the argument that Dan Marino was the most physically gifted passer

150
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:50,160
the sport has ever seen. In the modern day game, players like Aaron Rodgers and Patrick Mahomes

151
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:55,200
have provided quite the spectacle over their elite combination of arm strength and accuracy.

152
00:14:55,200 --> 00:15:00,400
Dan Marino's 1984 season represents what would happen if one of these guys hopped in a time

153
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:05,920
machine and traveled 35 years into the past. Indeed, Marino resembled a quarterback of the

154
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:11,200
distant future, with throwing mechanics so quick that television cameras could hardly keep up with

155
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:16,480
them. In just his sophomore season, he would rewrite the record books for the position. Prior

156
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:23,680
to 1984, the NFL season record for touchdown passes stood at 36. By season's end, Marino had

157
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:30,240
pushed the record to 48. This was no incremental improvement. This was like the scene in 2001 A

158
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:36,320
Space Odyssey that cuts from a bone to a spaceship. The numbers set during Marino's quantum leap would

159
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:41,840
not be bested until long after he retired, and the players that eventually surpassed him did so

160
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:47,200
under a ruleset that more heavily favored offensive production. Adjusted for ERA, Marino's

161
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:53,680
1984 season has to go down as the most impressive in history. Naturally, it contributed to a lot of

162
00:15:53,680 --> 00:16:00,960
wins as well. The 84 Dolphins would be the first team since the 72 squad to reach the 11-0 mark.

163
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:06,320
Unfortunately, their perfect season would come to an end just one week later after an overtime loss

164
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:12,400
to the Chargers. They would finish the regular season with a 14-2 record, one win back of the

165
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:19,200
San Francisco 49ers, who posted the NFL's first 15-1 season. The two teams would end up meeting

166
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:25,680
in the Super Bowl, where San Francisco's superior defense kept Marino's arm in check. The 49ers

167
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:31,280
handed the Dolphins a crushing defeat, and adding insult to injury, surpassed the win total of the

168
00:16:31,280 --> 00:16:37,600
72 team. Although the Niners fell just short of the perfect 19-0, they had proven that it was a

169
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:42,960
lot closer than what many may have thought. Despite the sour end of the season, the future looked

170
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:48,320
bright in Miami. Behind their veteran coach and transcendent young quarterback, it seemed like

171
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:53,760
the sky was the limit. But this is the point where our story takes a turn for the strange.

172
00:16:53,760 --> 00:16:58,640
While Dolphin fans were looking into the future, they should have taken more time to savor the

173
00:16:58,640 --> 00:17:05,040
present. Because as of today, 1984 would mark the last season Shula, Marino, or the Dolphins

174
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:11,920
franchise would ever reach the Super Bowl. 1984 would also mark the retirement of Bob Kuchenberg,

175
00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:18,720
the last active member of the 1972 roster. And with that, the NFL's first perfect team had entirely

176
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:25,280
exited the sport, or so we thought. Looking back now, many are convinced that the 72 Dolphins never

177
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:30,960
fully left. Over the years, a mysterious pattern has developed involving teams who get a little

178
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:36,080
too close to perfection, one that began immediately after the 1984 season.

179
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:49,440
After already surviving one threat to their legacy, the Dolphins would have to contend

180
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:56,160
with an even greater one in 1985, a franchise that was no stranger to chasing perfection.

181
00:17:56,160 --> 00:18:02,240
50 years after their original undefeated run, the Chicago Bears had returned to finish the job.

182
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:08,480
By December, they had shot out to a 12-0 record, anchored by the most feared defensive unit in NFL

183
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:14,160
history. By this point, the Bears looked downright unstoppable, defeating their last three opponents

184
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:20,880
by a combined score of 104-3. If any team was meant to finish the year with a perfect record,

185
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:26,880
this was surely the one. But before they could do so, they would have to pay a visit to Miami to face

186
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:31,920
the Dolphins on Monday Night Football. For the first time, the Dolphins had the opportunity to

187
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:38,720
defend their own legacy. And with the prestige of the 72 team on the line, they went out and played ball.

188
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:57,280
Touchdown. Moreno. Cooper. Davenport. Into the end zone easily.

189
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:06,240
Moreno gets the pressure, but he gets it to Matt Moore. Hysteria here in the Orange Bowl.

190
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:12,880
Against their last six opponents, the Bears' defense had only allowed a total of 29 points.

191
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:18,560
On this night, the Dolphins had scored more than that by halftime. All season long, the Bears had

192
00:19:18,560 --> 00:19:23,360
snuffed out pretty much every quarterback they faced, but they had yet to face a quarterback like

193
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:28,960
Moreno. The 46 defense relied on collapsing the line of scrimmage before the offense even had a

194
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:34,480
chance to throw, but Moreno had such a quick release that he could consistently beat out the pressure.

195
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:39,440
Despite how overpowered the scheme had been for the rest of the season, it had one critical

196
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:44,960
weakness in its pass coverage, a weakness that Shula and Moreno exposed in front of the largest

197
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:50,400
televised audience in Monday Night Football history. But by far the most influential audience

198
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:55,680
of the night was the one live in attendance at the Orange Bowl, the venue responsible for much of the

199
00:19:55,680 --> 00:20:01,040
Dolphins' early success. Back in the day, it was well known as one of the loudest stadiums in the

200
00:20:01,040 --> 00:20:06,480
sport due to how close the bleachers were to the field. In football lore, there's a term known as

201
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:12,720
the 12th man describing how a unified sea of fans can be just as powerful as an extra man on the

202
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:18,240
field. On that night, the Dolphins faithful delivered what truly was their finest hour.

203
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:23,520
During one sequence in the third quarter, they are going absolutely ballistic. The stadium is

204
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:29,440
so deafening that the Bears offense can't even hear their own snap count. The partisan crowd

205
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:34,160
noisy to the point that the Bears cannot hear their offensive signals.

206
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:40,160
For a long time, the Dolphins were the only professional sports team in the entire state.

207
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:45,520
Eight days a year, the Orange Bowl transformed from an ordinary ballpark to the pantheon of the

208
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:51,200
Florida man. It goes without saying that strange things tend to happen here. No matter how good the

209
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:56,960
Bears were, they never really stood a chance. It just wasn't their night. It's a good thing the

210
00:20:56,960 --> 00:21:01,920
Dolphins stopped them when they did because after this game, the Bears steamrolled everyone else for

211
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:07,920
the rest of the season, winning the championship with a record of 18-1. While many fans were

212
00:21:07,920 --> 00:21:13,360
eager to see the two teams square off once more in the Super Bowl, the Dolphins never made it.

213
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:17,840
The highly anticipated rematch would be thwarted by the New England Patriots,

214
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:24,880
a team that will come up again later on in our story. After the 85 season, the quest for

215
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:30,800
perfection died down for the rest of the decade. The 1990 season featured a unique scenario in

216
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:37,120
which two teams reached the 10-0 mark. However, as if their fates were intertwined, both ended up

217
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:43,200
losing the following week. After an 11-0 start by Washington the next season, the hunt died down

218
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:49,040
again for many more years. Oddly enough, the Dolphins spent a couple more seasons as the last

219
00:21:49,040 --> 00:21:54,720
undefeated team, which was a testament to their winning culture at the time. However, after the

220
00:21:54,720 --> 00:22:01,920
1995 season, the organization would experience its biggest shake-up yet when Don Shula finally called

221
00:22:01,920 --> 00:22:08,800
it quits. He retired as the winningest coach in NFL history. By this point, Shula basically was the

222
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:14,560
Dolphins. He had been there for every milestone the franchise had accomplished and his departure

223
00:22:14,560 --> 00:22:22,080
finally severed the link between the team's past and present. 1997 marked 25 years since the perfect

224
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:28,880
season. Maybe it was finally time to let it go. The following year, it would once again be put to the test.

225
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:38,000
The 1998 season was dominated by two juggernauts, starting with the defending champion Denver

226
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:44,160
Broncos, who became the first team in a quarter century to reach 13-0. With just three games

227
00:22:44,160 --> 00:22:49,200
left in the regular season, the Broncos entered their next contest as two touchdown favorites

228
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:55,520
versus the mediocre New York Giants. However, the Broncos offense sputtered all day and with less

229
00:22:55,520 --> 00:23:01,040
than a minute left, the Giants scored the game-winning touchdown to end Denver's bid of perfection.

230
00:23:01,040 --> 00:23:07,120
In the NFL, there's no such thing as a guaranteed win. Even the bottom feeders of the league must not

231
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:13,040
be underestimated. The perfect season requires near flawless execution each and every week.

232
00:23:13,040 --> 00:23:18,640
Any complacency can be punished from the most unlikely of sources. It turns out the Broncos

233
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:24,800
were not done being punished. After losing their perfect record, they had to travel to Miami to face

234
00:23:24,800 --> 00:23:30,800
Dan Marino on Monday Night Football. As was the case with the 85 Bears, the Dolphins handed the

235
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:36,720
NFL's strongest team their worst loss of the season. Just six weeks later, the Broncos would

236
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:42,560
return to the very same stadium and capture their second consecutive Super Bowl. It was almost like

237
00:23:42,560 --> 00:23:47,760
their loss to the Dolphins was some rite of passage, as if relinquishing part of their record

238
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:53,600
helped appease the spirits of football past, granting them a safe voyage through the postseason.

239
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:59,680
Denver's second loss left them with the second best record in the league behind the 15-1 Minnesota

240
00:23:59,680 --> 00:24:06,000
Vikings, a team that got closer than any other to the first 16-0 regular season. A three-point

241
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:11,920
loss in week nine was the only thing keeping them out of the record books. Remarkably, the 98 Vikings

242
00:24:11,920 --> 00:24:17,280
were flirting with perfection in more ways than one. Their kicker Gary Anderson had not missed a

243
00:24:17,280 --> 00:24:23,360
field goal all year. Thus far in the entire history of the league, no kicker had ever achieved a

244
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:28,880
perfectly accurate season. Thanks to Anderson's automatic leg, the Vikings looked to be on a

245
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:34,960
collision course with the Broncos. However, when the team needed him most, with a trip to the Super

246
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:41,680
Bowl on the line, he missed. The Vikings never made it to Miami. Some would say they had a little

247
00:24:41,680 --> 00:24:48,160
too much perfection to handle. The Dolphins record had survived yet again, and as the millennium came

248
00:24:48,160 --> 00:24:54,800
to a close, so too did the career of Dan Marino. He retired as the all-time leader in pretty much

249
00:24:54,800 --> 00:25:00,960
every passing stat imaginable, but despite all he accomplished, he was nonetheless haunted by his own

250
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:06,480
imperfection. After all those years, the Dolphins front office could never surround Marino with a

251
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:11,600
good enough supporting cast to compete for a championship. He walked away from the game as

252
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:17,520
arguably the best player to never win a Super Bowl ring. It's fascinating to think that by the end of

253
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:22,960
the 90s, the Dolphins franchise had showcased possibly the best coach and best quarterback in

254
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:28,720
the history of the league, yet both were seemingly overshadowed by this increasingly distant record.

255
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:34,480
The longer it stood, the more the legend around it grew. Around this time, a rumor began circulating

256
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:40,080
that after every season's last unbeaten team loses its perfect record, the surviving members

257
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:46,720
of the 72 Dolphins celebrate by toasting champagne. Their presence still loomed over the league like

258
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:52,640
some sort of defined specter. It was like the game had progressed to the future, but this relic from

259
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:58,640
the past would not allow itself to be left behind. As the years went on, the league-wide failure to

260
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:04,160
replicate the perfect season only made teams want it more, and it wasn't long before the Dolphins'

261
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:13,760
record was under siege once again. The 2000s would bring plenty of more challengers to the throne,

262
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:20,560
starting with the 04 Steelers, who became just the fourth team to post a 15-1 regular season.

263
00:26:20,560 --> 00:26:25,840
Rookie quarterback Ben Roethlisberger led them on a 14-game winning streak to end the year.

264
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:30,720
However, much like the 98 Vikings, the Steelers would fall short in the playoffs,

265
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:35,840
suffering a convincing defeat to the Patriots. Despite Roethlisberger's impressive rookie

266
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:41,120
campaign, much of the headlines throughout the season would be dominated by another quarterback.

267
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:47,280
2004 was a breakout season for Peyton Manning, who became the first player to surpass Dan Marino's

268
00:26:47,280 --> 00:26:52,720
single-season touchdown record. The year after, he had his sights set on another record.

269
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:58,480
The 2005 Colts looked like the team to beat all season long. Their high-powered passing attack

270
00:26:58,480 --> 00:27:04,400
carried them all the way to a 13-0 record. But just like the 98 Broncos, Manning and the Colts

271
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:10,640
would lose their next two games, finishing the regular season at 14-2. However, unlike the

272
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:16,160
Broncos, the Colts would not be blessed with playoff success. Despite being overwhelming

273
00:27:16,160 --> 00:27:22,080
championship favorites, their season would end in disastrous fashion. Down by just three points in

274
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:28,080
the final seconds, the Colts needed to make a 46-yard field goal to tie the game. Lining up for

275
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:33,680
the attempt was Mike VanderJagt, who by this point was the most accurate kicker in NFL history.

276
00:27:33,680 --> 00:27:39,120
Thus far in his playoff career, he hasn't missed a kick on the Colts' home turf. In any other

277
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:44,000
circumstance, things would have probably turned out differently, but these Colts had challenged

278
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:56,560
perfection and the Ghosts had unfinished business. Despite the brutal defeat, Manning and the Colts

279
00:27:56,560 --> 00:28:02,960
hadn't given up on chasing perfection. In 2006, they got off to a far more modest 9-0 start

280
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:08,800
before losing four of their last seven games. Oddly enough, the added adversities seemed to work in

281
00:28:08,800 --> 00:28:13,680
their favor as this Colts team marched through the playoffs to score the city of Indianapolis

282
00:28:13,680 --> 00:28:19,200
their first Super Bowl victory. The championship seemed to corroborate a paradoxical trend among

283
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:24,640
the NFL's contenders. For the past few years, teams with worse records were having better

284
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:30,000
success in the playoffs. It was almost as if to give yourself better odds of winning the title,

285
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:35,840
it was advantageous to lose more during the regular season. This idea would be revisited by

286
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:42,000
the 2009 Colts, who found themselves with a third opportunity at a perfect season and to raise the

287
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:48,800
stakes even higher. This time, they had company. 2009 was just the second season in recent history

288
00:28:48,800 --> 00:28:54,480
that saw two teams reach the 10-0 mark. The New Orleans Saints had joined the Colts in the pursuit

289
00:28:54,480 --> 00:29:02,080
of perfection and both teams just kept on winning. Their records climbed to 11-12, then 13-0 before

290
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:08,560
the Saints finally conceded a defeat. Once again, the Colts stood unopposed as the last remaining

291
00:29:08,560 --> 00:29:13,920
perfect team. The following week, they looked poised to advance to 15-0 while leading the

292
00:29:13,920 --> 00:29:19,200
Jets late in the third quarter. It was then when coach Jim Caldwell did the unthinkable.

293
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:30,160
Peyton Manning has his helmet on. For the first time all season, someone other than Peyton Manning

294
00:29:30,160 --> 00:29:34,960
will take the snap at quarterback for the Indianapolis Colts. The painter is the number

295
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:42,240
two quarterback. Lost the football. It's loose. Inside the five-yard line, the Jets cover for the

296
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:57,200
touchdown. After already securing home field advantage in the playoffs, the Colts decided to

297
00:29:57,200 --> 00:30:02,880
bench their starters for the remainder of the game. For the first and only time in league history,

298
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:08,480
a team had intentionally sabotaged its own perfect season. The decision would prove highly

299
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:13,920
controversial. The moment Peyton Manning was taken out of the game, the fans in attendance rained

300
00:30:13,920 --> 00:30:19,520
down thunderous boos. Many of them couldn't believe what they were watching. The Colts had rested

301
00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:24,880
their starters before, but never with a perfect season on the line. The coaching staff remained

302
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:30,000
steadfast in their reasoning, saying that winning the championship was the ultimate goal and that

303
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:35,200
preserving the health of their star players was imperative to that goal, even if it meant

304
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:40,880
sacrificing a perfect record. At the end of the day, an undefeated season is theoretically

305
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:46,800
insignificant. It doesn't offer any additional rewards or advantages versus any other champion.

306
00:30:46,800 --> 00:30:51,600
The objective of NFL football is to hoist the Lombardi Trophy at the end of the season,

307
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:56,560
and however you manage to get there should be irrelevant. The perfect season is just bragging

308
00:30:56,560 --> 00:31:01,840
rights. It's a nice thing to have. An amusing little factoid for geeks on the internet to

309
00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:08,640
romanticize in the unknowable future. But beyond all that, does it really, truly matter? Well,

310
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:13,200
to answer that question, you have to look no further than the expressions of the fans and

311
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:18,800
players watching their run come to a bitter end. You can say what you want to justify what happened,

312
00:31:18,800 --> 00:31:24,480
but it clearly mattered to them. Six weeks later, the Colts would lose the Super Bowl,

313
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:29,520
and their undefeated season was sacrificed for nothing. They were beaten by the Saints,

314
00:31:29,520 --> 00:31:35,360
who had surrendered their perfect record fair and square. Their season came to an end in Miami,

315
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:40,080
meaning that the ghosts may have played a hand in it. Perhaps they didn't want to leave the Colts

316
00:31:40,080 --> 00:31:44,960
with any excuses to entertain the thought that they could have been perfect if they had simply

317
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:51,040
chosen to. If a team was truly meant to be perfect, the results would be unmistakable.

318
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:54,880
We cannot choose perfection any more than we can choose our destiny.

319
00:31:57,040 --> 00:32:03,120
And so, the Dolphins perfect season had survived its most competitive decade yet. Despite facing

320
00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:08,640
more challengers than ever, no other team could manage to top them. The next 10 years would see

321
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:14,720
the pursuit of perfection slow down considerably. But they still produced a few worthy adversaries,

322
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:20,880
the first of which were the 2011 Packers, who started the year 13-0 before being upset by the

323
00:32:21,280 --> 00:32:26,080
5-8 Chiefs. After the loss, the Packers followed in the footsteps of the Colts by

324
00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:31,760
resting their starters, a decision that, once again, backfired. After dominating all year

325
00:32:31,760 --> 00:32:37,120
with their historically great offense, the Packers' stars ran cold in the postseason.

326
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:42,960
They earned the dubious distinction of becoming the first 15-1 team that failed to win a single

327
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:49,680
playoff game. The 2015 season featured what remains to this day as the last great run at

328
00:32:49,680 --> 00:32:55,440
perfection. The Carolina Panthers got off to the rare 14-0 start before inexplicably

329
00:32:55,440 --> 00:33:01,840
falling to the Atlanta Falcons, a team they had beaten 38-0 just two weeks earlier. The Panthers

330
00:33:01,840 --> 00:33:06,560
would go on to the Super Bowl where they would lose to our old friend Peyton Manning. Although

331
00:33:06,560 --> 00:33:12,480
he never got his perfect season, he was able to retire on top. As for the Panthers, they only

332
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:18,640
continued the futility of 15-1 teams in the postseason. As of today, they are the last NFL

333
00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:24,320
roster to finish the regular season with just one loss. Since then, no one else has really come

334
00:33:24,320 --> 00:33:30,880
close to the perfect season, and the legacy of the 72 Dolphins lives on. However, many of you

335
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:35,840
watching have probably noticed that I haven't told the full story, and that's because I've been

336
00:33:35,840 --> 00:33:42,080
saving the best for last. Over all this time, many teams have tried and failed to replicate the

337
00:33:42,080 --> 00:33:50,000
perfect season, but there is one that got closer than any other. The market's in an itsy-bitsy

338
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:55,280
little gully right now. It's like everybody said, okay that was crazy, let's just all calm down.

339
00:33:59,680 --> 00:34:05,280
By the mid-2000s, the Dolphins had fallen on hard times. For the past several years,

340
00:34:05,280 --> 00:34:10,720
South Florida had been battered by hurricanes, which only served to punctuate the gloomy outlook

341
00:34:10,720 --> 00:34:16,160
for the future of the organization. Ever since Marino and Shula retired, the Dolphins had

342
00:34:16,160 --> 00:34:21,040
struggled to find any quarterback or coach that had the makings of a worthy successor.

343
00:34:21,040 --> 00:34:27,120
Meanwhile, the franchise that had was their longtime divisional foes, the New England Patriots.

344
00:34:27,120 --> 00:34:32,000
As the Dolphins sunk into dysfunction and instability, the Patriots had assembled the most

345
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:38,160
ferocious dynasty the league had ever known. This team was no ordinary juggernaut. It was far more

346
00:34:38,160 --> 00:34:44,080
diabolical than that. Facing the Patriots during this time was like staring down the Death Star.

347
00:34:44,080 --> 00:34:48,400
They were a team designed to crush the hopes and dreams of the rest of the league.

348
00:34:48,400 --> 00:34:55,760
And for Dolphins fans, no season felt more hopeless than 2007. In August of that year,

349
00:34:55,760 --> 00:35:02,000
the city of Miami began the process of demolishing the Orange Bowl. The Dolphins had relocated to a

350
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:08,640
new stadium long ago, and the site had fallen into disrepair. Ever since the departure, the team was

351
00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:14,080
never really the same. It seemed like the franchise had left part of their heart and soul in that old

352
00:35:14,080 --> 00:35:19,680
venue. The Orange Bowl was still very much the spiritual center of the Miami Dolphins, especially

353
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:26,160
the 1972 team. By erasing such a historic place, it's almost like they were asking for trouble.

354
00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:36,400
Applying the last lick from the Patriots, our final score 49-28, New England.

355
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:43,920
Immediately after, the Dolphins got off to the most miserable start in franchise history.

356
00:35:43,920 --> 00:35:49,360
By the halfway point in the season, they had failed to win a single game. Their three best

357
00:35:49,360 --> 00:35:54,640
offensive players had suffered season-ending injuries, leaving their game plan in a disarray.

358
00:35:54,640 --> 00:35:59,680
The Dolphins had no other choice but to conduct their offense through quarterback Cleo Lemon,

359
00:35:59,680 --> 00:36:05,920
a player who never started another meaningful game before or since. To make matters even worse,

360
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:11,680
their arch rivals were headed in the polar opposite direction. The 2007 Patriots were on

361
00:36:11,680 --> 00:36:16,480
track to become the greatest team in history, featuring the most disgustingly unfair

362
00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:21,840
amassment of talent that will likely ever exist on an NFL roster. At the center of it all was

363
00:36:21,840 --> 00:36:27,520
newcomer Randy Moss, a top five receiver of all time, teaming up with franchise cornerstone Tom

364
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:33,120
Brady, the single greatest quarterback of all time. They didn't just start the year undefeated.

365
00:36:33,120 --> 00:36:38,480
No one even came close to defeating them. Plenty of other teams through the years have challenged

366
00:36:38,480 --> 00:36:44,080
perfection, but these Patriots were different. It wasn't enough to simply win. They had to do so

367
00:36:44,080 --> 00:36:49,680
with such extreme prejudice. Before long, it was clear that this team had only one destination in

368
00:36:49,680 --> 00:36:54,640
mind. A championship wasn't enough. They were aiming for something even greater.

369
00:36:58,160 --> 00:37:04,400
By December, the Patriots still hadn't lost, and the Dolphins still hadn't won. The sky was

370
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:10,400
falling in Miami, and the ghosts were nowhere to be seen. For the Dolphins' faithful, the grim

371
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:16,000
reality was starting to set in. Not only were the Patriots closing in on the ultimate triumph,

372
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:19,920
but the Dolphins were on the verge of the ultimate humiliation.

373
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:26,640
Since the advent of the 16-game schedule, no NFL team had ever gone winless. In a cruel twist of

374
00:37:26,640 --> 00:37:32,000
fate, the franchise renowned for the NFL's most prestigious achievement was now in danger of

375
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:39,040
inheriting its most shameful. 0-16, the mark of the Banished Prince, a scar from which they could

376
00:37:39,040 --> 00:37:45,360
never recover. With just three games left to play, it was starting to look like destiny. At that

377
00:37:45,360 --> 00:37:55,520
point, they had precisely one opportunity to save themselves. Their next matchup came against the

378
00:37:55,520 --> 00:38:00,960
struggling Baltimore Ravens, by far the most winnable game remaining on the schedule. If the

379
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:06,480
Dolphins can't pull out a victory here, they're not going to have another chance. After two quarters

380
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:12,640
of offensive ineptitude, they enter the half trailing 13-3. In attendance for the halftime

381
00:38:12,640 --> 00:38:18,800
ceremony are the members of the 1972 team, who are being honored for the 35-year anniversary of

382
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:24,480
their grand accomplishment. Their presence signals one of two things. Either the Dolphins have found

383
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:30,960
their salvation, or this really is the end, and the ghosts are just here to say goodbye to the legacy

384
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:36,640
they built all those years ago. Perhaps sensing the gravity of the situation, Miami's players

385
00:38:36,640 --> 00:38:42,080
emerged from the locker room with purpose. As the pride of the franchise rested on their shoulders,

386
00:38:42,080 --> 00:38:47,840
the Dolphins rallied back to tie the game, and eventually take the lead. All they had to do now

387
00:38:47,840 --> 00:38:54,000
was hold off the Ravens for two minutes. However, after a bad kickoff, Baltimore drove all the way

388
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:59,680
down the field. In the final seconds, they get the ball just one foot away from the end zone,

389
00:38:59,680 --> 00:39:05,360
but rather than trying for the go-ahead touchdown, the Ravens elect to play it safe and kick a field

390
00:39:05,360 --> 00:39:11,600
goal, sending the game to overtime. Luck is not on the Dolphins' side as the Ravens get the ball

391
00:39:11,600 --> 00:39:17,520
first, forcing Miami's exhausted defense back on the field. Baltimore marches all the way into

392
00:39:17,520 --> 00:39:23,280
scoring position, where they can end the game with a 44-yard field goal. This season, the Dolphins

393
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:29,280
have lost six games by just a three-point margin, and it's about to happen again. A series of

394
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:34,160
individual bad breaks have now snowballed into the nightmare they currently inhabit.

395
00:39:34,160 --> 00:39:40,640
The stadium has fallen mostly silent. Deep down, everyone is expecting this kick to go in, including

396
00:39:40,640 --> 00:39:46,800
Dolphins color commentator Jim Mandich. He was there during the franchise's finest hour, and now

397
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:53,040
he's arrived at its darkest. It's been a long season, and he's preparing to sink into the abyss.

398
00:39:53,040 --> 00:39:55,760
What happens next, though, springs him back to life.

399
00:39:56,560 --> 00:40:12,160
And just like that, the Dolphins have a chance. If the offense can just find any sort of magic,

400
00:40:12,160 --> 00:40:16,880
they can still come out of this thing in one piece. However, for a unit that has struggled

401
00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:24,000
mightily all season, the end zone feels so very far away. 35 years ago, the Dolphins were on their way

402
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:29,520
to being immortalized in the record books. Now, these Dolphins are fighting for the right to be

403
00:40:29,520 --> 00:40:35,200
forgotten. Way back at the end of Super Bowl VII, embedded within their crowning achievement was

404
00:40:35,200 --> 00:40:41,040
another embarrassing episode that has been mostly lost to time. At the end of the game, kicker Gero

405
00:40:41,040 --> 00:40:45,760
Yapremian committed one of the most atrocious bloopers in the history of organized sports.

406
00:40:46,320 --> 00:40:52,000
It's fascinating to consider that the NFL's perfect team was somehow responsible for its single

407
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:57,360
worst play. Maybe it was their gift to the universe to prove the age-old wisdom that no one

408
00:40:57,360 --> 00:41:04,080
is truly perfect. 35 years later, the universe would repay the favor. As for a single moment,

409
00:41:04,080 --> 00:41:07,520
the NFL's worst team was blessed with the perfect play.

410
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:30,000
Unbelievable! Unbelievable! The Dolphins have done it! They have won this football!

411
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:34,320
Take us out of the history book! We're not going in for that one, baby!

412
00:41:35,040 --> 00:41:40,160
The 07 Dolphins may have narrowly avoided catastrophe, but they weren't out of the woods

413
00:41:40,160 --> 00:41:45,440
yet. While they were spared from going down as the worst ever, their legacy was still very

414
00:41:45,440 --> 00:41:52,080
much in jeopardy. The following week, the 01 and 13 Dolphins traveled to Foxboro to face the 14 and

415
00:41:52,080 --> 00:41:57,840
0 Patriots. They entered the game as 22-point underdogs, one of the biggest point spreads in

416
00:41:57,840 --> 00:42:03,840
history. However, the Dolphins have overcome the odds before when it came to defending their honor.

417
00:42:03,840 --> 00:42:08,720
Could the worst version of the Dolphins really pull off the upset versus the best version of

418
00:42:08,720 --> 00:42:15,120
the Patriots? Well, as amusing as that may have been, even I have to admit that the idea was a

419
00:42:15,120 --> 00:42:21,680
little too far-fetched. And so, the Patriots were just one game away from the first undefeated

420
00:42:21,680 --> 00:42:27,760
regular season in the 16-game era. The only team left standing in their way was the 10 and 5 New

421
00:42:27,760 --> 00:42:33,280
York Giants. By this point, both teams had locked up their respective playoff spots, meaning that

422
00:42:33,280 --> 00:42:39,200
they each had the opportunity to rest their starters. However, understanding what was at stake,

423
00:42:39,200 --> 00:42:44,560
everyone showed up to play. For a moment, it looked like the Patriots had found their kryptonite

424
00:42:44,560 --> 00:42:50,240
as the Giants entered the fourth quarter with the lead. But Brady and Moss could not be stopped as

425
00:42:50,240 --> 00:42:56,960
the Patriots rallied back to win. They had arrived at the elusive 16 and 0, just three postseason

426
00:42:56,960 --> 00:43:02,480
victories away from perfection. Dolphins fans and the rest of the league held their breath as the

427
00:43:02,480 --> 00:43:09,040
Patriots inched closer and closer. The Jaguars put up a valiant effort but were ultimately no match.

428
00:43:09,040 --> 00:43:15,520
The fabled 17 and 0 record, which stood alone for so long, had been equaled. In the AFC

429
00:43:15,520 --> 00:43:21,440
Championship, the Chargers held the Pats offense to just 21 points, but it still wasn't enough to

430
00:43:21,440 --> 00:43:28,720
stop them. For the first time in NFL history, a team had reached 18 and 0. The 72 Dolphins had

431
00:43:28,720 --> 00:43:34,400
been surpassed. This Patriots team may have held nearly every single accolade the league kept track

432
00:43:34,400 --> 00:43:40,880
of, but they still weren't perfect. Awaiting them in Super Bowl 42 was their final opponent.

433
00:43:40,880 --> 00:43:46,320
In a twist no one saw coming, the only team left standing in their way was, once again,

434
00:43:46,320 --> 00:43:51,680
the New York Giants. It would be the first Super Bowl appearance for the other Manning brother.

435
00:43:51,680 --> 00:43:57,600
While Peyton could never quite find perfection, Eli could do the next best thing by preventing it.

436
00:43:57,600 --> 00:44:03,120
The Giants entered the game as one of the biggest underdogs in Super Bowl history. Nobody expected

437
00:44:03,120 --> 00:44:07,520
them to get there in the first place, and now that they did, they had to face what was already

438
00:44:07,520 --> 00:44:13,280
being crowned as the best team ever. But despite the overwhelming task in front of these Giants,

439
00:44:13,280 --> 00:44:19,040
they knew that the pressure was on the Patriots. After how far they'd come, this was a game they

440
00:44:19,040 --> 00:44:25,120
could not lose. Sometimes it pays to be the underdog. You have nothing to do but go out

441
00:44:25,120 --> 00:44:30,960
and shock the world. The game was a tense defensive struggle. For the first three quarters,

442
00:44:30,960 --> 00:44:37,120
the score remained deadlocked at 7-3. With just 10 minutes left, the Giants finally broke through

443
00:44:37,120 --> 00:44:42,320
to take the lead. It looked like the nerves were really getting to the Patriots, as they were on

444
00:44:42,320 --> 00:44:47,120
the verge of losing everything they had worked for. With their backs against the wall, Brady

445
00:44:47,120 --> 00:44:52,480
led a touchdown drive to retake the lead with less than three minutes to play. If the defense could

446
00:44:52,480 --> 00:44:58,400
stop the Giants from marching 83 yards down the field, then perfection was theirs. Thus far,

447
00:44:58,400 --> 00:45:03,520
the Patriots have experienced good fortune all season, but their luck was about to change,

448
00:45:03,520 --> 00:45:09,200
because after biding their time until the last possible opportunity, the ghosts had finally come

449
00:45:09,200 --> 00:45:15,360
out to play. Early in the drive, the Patriots have a chance to end the game by stopping the Giants on

450
00:45:15,360 --> 00:45:21,520
fourth and one. Running back Brandon Jacobs just barely converts, and the game continues. On the

451
00:45:21,520 --> 00:45:27,840
next play, Manning gets hammered by a defender, but he hangs on to the ball, and the game continues.

452
00:45:27,840 --> 00:45:33,520
The play after that, Manning misses badly on a throw, sending the ball straight towards defender

453
00:45:33,520 --> 00:45:40,240
Ahsante Samuel. The ball bounces off his fingertips, and the game continues. The Giants had now dodged

454
00:45:40,240 --> 00:45:46,080
a bullet on three consecutive plays, but it's the next one which turns this sequence from lucky

455
00:45:46,080 --> 00:45:52,240
to downright supernatural. Manning drops back to throw and is immediately smothered by the defense.

456
00:45:52,240 --> 00:45:57,200
Somehow he escapes. Eli heaves the ball towards receiver David Tyree,

457
00:45:57,200 --> 00:46:01,200
who after this game will never catch another pass for the rest of his career.

458
00:46:16,480 --> 00:46:21,200
What just transpired may have been the most unlikely series of events to ever happen in

459
00:46:21,200 --> 00:46:27,440
a single NFL play, and it occurred at the direct expense of a team 60 seconds away from a perfect

460
00:46:27,440 --> 00:46:32,640
season. In this moment, it finally dawned on the Patriots that after all this time,

461
00:46:32,640 --> 00:46:38,800
they weren't the team of destiny. Four plays later, the Giants scored the game-winning touchdown.

462
00:46:38,800 --> 00:46:43,600
Many considered a Giants victory to be unthinkable, but if you've been following along,

463
00:46:43,600 --> 00:46:48,000
you may have noticed that they've been doing this kind of thing since the very beginning.

464
00:46:48,080 --> 00:46:53,360
The final seconds of the game featured Tom Brady desperately chucking the ball downfield to Randy

465
00:46:53,360 --> 00:46:58,720
Moss, a play that had worked so many times for them during the season. This time, however,

466
00:46:58,720 --> 00:47:04,160
it just isn't meant to be. The Patriots had made it to the very doorstep of perfectville.

467
00:47:04,160 --> 00:47:10,240
They kept knocking and knocking, but no one was there to answer. The 2007 Patriots finished with

468
00:47:10,240 --> 00:47:16,160
an 18-1 record, choking away perfection in the final minute of the final game. They had come

469
00:47:16,160 --> 00:47:22,160
the closest of anybody and were therefore condemned to the very worst fate. Many years

470
00:47:22,160 --> 00:47:27,760
later, Tom Brady retired as by far the greatest quarterback to ever play the game. He ended up

471
00:47:27,760 --> 00:47:33,280
throwing for over a hundred thousand yards, an unfathomable amount. He played the most,

472
00:47:33,280 --> 00:47:39,280
did the most, and won the most. He was the absolute best athlete that anyone could have asked for,

473
00:47:39,280 --> 00:47:46,400
but he wasn't perfect. Since 1972, no one is.

474
00:47:57,440 --> 00:48:03,600
In the summer of 2013, the undefeated Dolphins received an unexpected invitation. President

475
00:48:03,600 --> 00:48:08,880
Obama had welcomed them to the White House. Ordinarily, this honor is reserved for reigning

476
00:48:08,880 --> 00:48:14,240
champions of American sports, but by this point the squad had become so legendary that it was

477
00:48:14,240 --> 00:48:20,160
worth the exception. In their time, the NFL just didn't matter as much as it does today,

478
00:48:20,160 --> 00:48:25,920
and the team never received a proper ovation. This was possibly because then President Richard

479
00:48:25,920 --> 00:48:32,400
Nixon, a Redskins fan, evidently didn't feel like celebrating. Despite the snub, the players never

480
00:48:32,400 --> 00:48:38,160
thought much of it. What's funny to consider is that the 72 Dolphins probably never realized just

481
00:48:38,160 --> 00:48:42,960
how big of a deal their accomplishment would end up being. It's fair to say that no other

482
00:48:42,960 --> 00:48:51,920
team in American sports has remained so relevant for so long. 2022 marked 50 years since the perfect

483
00:48:51,920 --> 00:48:59,760
season. By now, the NFL's 16-game era has come and gone with no team ever reaching the elusive 19-0.

484
00:48:59,760 --> 00:49:06,400
As of today, the bar to clear is now 20-0 after the league expanded its regular season to 17 games

485
00:49:06,400 --> 00:49:12,080
in 2021. And with talks of an 18-game schedule on the horizon, it's looking more and more

486
00:49:12,080 --> 00:49:18,640
improbable that anyone else can get to perfectville. And so the obvious question remains, will anyone

487
00:49:18,640 --> 00:49:24,400
ever break the Dolphins' record? However, I think the far more interesting question to be asked is

488
00:49:24,400 --> 00:49:30,480
whether we want to see it happen. When it aired, more viewers tuned into Super Bowl 42 than any

489
00:49:30,480 --> 00:49:36,880
other game in American history. People are fascinated by perfection. To witness it is akin to

490
00:49:36,880 --> 00:49:42,960
encountering a pristine oasis in a vast, barren wasteland. The human condition is defined by

491
00:49:42,960 --> 00:49:49,040
imperfection. Modern existence is utterly inundated with mediocrity and dysfunction. And while you may

492
00:49:49,040 --> 00:49:54,320
think this would only intensify our appetite for perfect things, it turns out that people seem to

493
00:49:54,320 --> 00:50:00,800
prefer the contrary. Because as the Patriots were closing in on 19 and 0, most of us were rooting

494
00:50:00,800 --> 00:50:06,320
for them to lose. The same is true whenever any team gets a little too far in the season without

495
00:50:06,320 --> 00:50:12,240
a defeat. In fact, preying on the downfall of the last undefeated team has become somewhat of an

496
00:50:12,240 --> 00:50:18,720
annual tradition. The NFL has already seen one perfect record. And for most fans, that's enough.

497
00:50:18,720 --> 00:50:23,120
It's been around for so long now that it's hard to imagine the game without it.

498
00:50:23,120 --> 00:50:28,240
So many illustrious teams have failed in their quest to reproduce it that any others pursuing

499
00:50:28,240 --> 00:50:34,960
it today just feel unworthy. But surely, after enough time passes, a new challenger is bound to

500
00:50:34,960 --> 00:50:41,040
come along and give the ghosts a run for their money. So far this season, the 2023 Dolphins won't

501
00:50:41,040 --> 00:50:46,640
finish the year perfect, but they did manage to make some history of their own. The ultra-rare

502
00:50:46,640 --> 00:50:52,960
70-point game, a milestone that no team had accomplished since the dark ages of the sport,

503
00:50:52,960 --> 00:50:57,760
a feat so alien to the modern football world that it doesn't look right on our present-day

504
00:50:57,760 --> 00:51:03,760
scoreboards. After all this time, the Dolphins still have the uncanny ability to captivate us

505
00:51:03,760 --> 00:51:09,360
by making numbers go up. At the end of the game, they had the opportunity to run up the score even

506
00:51:09,360 --> 00:51:15,920
higher and tie the all-time record of 73. However, while on the cusp of what could have been its most

507
00:51:15,920 --> 00:51:22,080
defining career achievement, coach Mike McDaniel ordered his team to stand down. When asked about

508
00:51:22,080 --> 00:51:29,760
it afterwards, he explained that it was a matter of karma. The modern NFL is more data-driven than

509
00:51:29,760 --> 00:51:35,600
ever before. Every measurable statistic is tracked and analyzed to give teams any sort of edge over

510
00:51:35,600 --> 00:51:41,680
the competition. McDaniel himself is considered one of the most brilliant strategic minds in the game,

511
00:51:41,680 --> 00:51:46,640
and yet plenty of the league's most important historic decisions are still governed by

512
00:51:46,640 --> 00:51:54,400
superstition. And that's called karma, and I'm trying to keep good karma with the Miami Dolphins.

513
00:51:55,040 --> 00:52:02,880
By now, everyone knows that bad things happen when you try to pass 72. Hi, I'm Don Shula. I like to

514
00:52:02,880 --> 00:52:08,720
watch movies. I've seen this next one quite a few times already, but you know something? I don't

515
00:52:08,720 --> 00:52:14,480
think I'll ever get tired of seeing you. They say that records are meant to be broken. It stands to

516
00:52:14,480 --> 00:52:20,240
reason that somewhere down the line, one fortunate team will eventually join the perfect Dolphins on

517
00:52:20,240 --> 00:52:26,480
the mountaintop. However, there is a realistic possibility that no one ever gets there again,

518
00:52:26,480 --> 00:52:31,040
and that the perfect season is that much more special than anyone could have imagined.

519
00:52:31,040 --> 00:52:36,640
If that's the case, then the 72 Dolphins may have stumbled upon something that defies everything we

520
00:52:36,640 --> 00:52:44,000
know about sports. They own a title that they may truly never lose again. The legend continues, and

521
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:49,760
until anyone else can complete the journey up the stairway, the NFL's only perfect team will be

522
00:52:49,760 --> 00:52:56,800
waiting and watching. As the years go by, these select few men have nothing else to do but savor

523
00:52:56,800 --> 00:53:02,560
the moment. Many of them are no longer with us. It's entirely possible that their defining

524
00:53:02,560 --> 00:53:07,840
achievement will outlive them all. If there really is a team of ghosts haunting the league from the

525
00:53:07,840 --> 00:53:14,080
other side, it's just gonna keep getting stronger. Someday, not too long from now, they'll all be

526
00:53:14,080 --> 00:53:19,680
reunited for the final time, and when that happens, I hope they remember to bring champagne.

527
00:53:32,720 --> 00:53:38,960
We're always in control, and when you say Miami, you're talking Super Bowl, cause we're the

528
00:53:38,960 --> 00:53:48,400
Miami Dolphins, Miami Dolphins, Miami Dolphins number one. Yes, we're the Miami Dolphins,

529
00:53:48,400 --> 00:53:53,680
Miami Dolphins, Miami Dolphins number one.
