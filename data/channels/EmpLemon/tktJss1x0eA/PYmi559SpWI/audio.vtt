00:00.000 --> 00:02.800
What is the point of making movies?

00:02.800 --> 00:05.040
There are many answers to this question,

00:05.040 --> 00:07.840
ranging from the creative to the persuasive.

00:07.840 --> 00:09.280
But in this day and age,

00:09.280 --> 00:14.480
the motivations of the film industry at large come down to something far more cynical.

00:14.480 --> 00:19.120
The truth is that the average movie only sees the light of day for one reason.

00:19.120 --> 00:21.760
Another five-letter word that starts with M.

00:24.640 --> 00:27.440
Uh-oh, looks like we just ran out of funding.

00:28.000 --> 00:31.760
Well, I guess we better queue up some coming attractions.

00:38.960 --> 00:40.880
Do you remember Opera?

00:40.880 --> 00:43.520
What, that web browser we used to use as kids?

00:43.520 --> 00:44.080
They're back.

00:47.600 --> 00:50.480
Check it out, they got this new integrated AI called ARIA.

00:50.480 --> 00:54.960
It's so smart, I can physically feel my IQ rising by using this thing!

00:54.960 --> 00:57.920
ARIA, give me tomorrow's lottery numbers.

00:59.120 --> 01:01.920
One browser is more secure than the rest.

01:03.440 --> 01:05.680
I don't know, he locked himself in his room.

01:05.680 --> 01:08.560
Kind of like how Opera locks down their users' privacy.

01:08.560 --> 01:11.440
One browser is more lucid than the rest.

01:11.440 --> 01:14.080
Looks like they added this thing called Lucid Mode.

01:14.080 --> 01:18.880
It makes digital experiences more lifelike, almost as if they're real.

01:19.440 --> 01:21.840
One browser will reign supreme.

01:21.840 --> 01:24.320
I'm starting to get concerned about Rusty.

01:24.320 --> 01:26.480
He hasn't left his house in three days,

01:26.480 --> 01:31.280
and the last thing he mentioned to me was something about becoming one with Opera.

01:31.280 --> 01:32.320
This winter...

01:32.320 --> 01:34.480
Open the studio doors, ARIA.

01:34.480 --> 01:35.760
It ain't over.

01:35.760 --> 01:37.600
I'm hiding in the woods right now.

01:37.600 --> 01:39.120
It's the only place it can't get me.

01:39.680 --> 01:40.480
Oh my god.

01:41.760 --> 01:42.400
What is that?

01:43.040 --> 01:44.880
To the Virtual Lady Sings.

01:45.520 --> 01:46.800
What is happening?

01:46.800 --> 01:49.120
They put me in the computer!

01:49.120 --> 01:50.000
Starring...

01:50.000 --> 01:56.000
Built-in VPN, ad blocker, sidebar music player, and inorganizable tabs.

01:57.120 --> 01:59.760
At last, I have found her.

02:00.960 --> 02:02.880
Introducing Opera.

02:03.440 --> 02:05.440
Coming soon to you.

02:09.760 --> 02:15.120
It's easy to get carried away by the stardom and spectacle that Hollywood blockbusters provide,

02:15.120 --> 02:16.800
but make no mistake about it.

02:16.800 --> 02:20.160
These things exist to serve a very specific purpose.

02:20.160 --> 02:24.240
No different from that of a McDonald's cheeseburger or a can of Coke.

02:24.240 --> 02:28.400
The vast majority of movies are designed to be consumer products.

02:28.400 --> 02:32.400
They are a tool used by corporations to generate profit.

02:32.400 --> 02:37.360
The most fundamental aspect of business is being able to make more than you spend.

02:37.360 --> 02:40.080
And before a single frame of film is shot,

02:40.080 --> 02:45.760
its investors must have confidence that whatever their funding is an asset and not a liability.

02:45.760 --> 02:48.960
Despite fulfilling the same general economic function,

02:48.960 --> 02:53.840
the way in which films make their money is unique to most other consumer goods.

02:53.840 --> 02:57.360
A single successful movie is potentially more valuable than

02:57.360 --> 03:00.800
selling 10,000 cars or 10 million sandwiches.

03:00.800 --> 03:03.920
With so much revenue tied up in just one product,

03:03.920 --> 03:08.160
it completely changes the way in which producers have to approach risk.

03:08.160 --> 03:12.880
The dreaded box office bomb can be as destructive as its name suggests.

03:12.880 --> 03:15.680
The industry's biggest flops have ruined careers,

03:15.680 --> 03:20.880
bankrupted companies and have even led to the extinction of entire genres of storytelling.

03:20.880 --> 03:24.320
Most Hollywood studios hesitate to swing for the fences

03:24.320 --> 03:27.760
because the risk of striking out is often catastrophic.

03:27.760 --> 03:31.920
Keeping the playbook safe and predictable is usually what's best for business,

03:31.920 --> 03:35.200
even if it comes at the cost of artistic integrity.

03:35.200 --> 03:40.320
There's no need to reinvent the wheel when the formula for success is already set in stone.

03:40.960 --> 03:45.600
The highest grossing films in history tend to have a few things in common.

03:45.600 --> 03:51.440
As it turns out, 2023 has seen not one but two new entries to the coveted list.

03:51.440 --> 03:56.320
The Mario movie featuring the most recognizable video game mascot of all time

03:56.320 --> 04:01.200
and the Barbie movie featuring the most recognizable toy mascot of all time.

04:01.200 --> 04:06.480
When you add in Harry Potter, the most recognizable literary mascot of the 21st century,

04:06.480 --> 04:08.720
you may start to notice a pattern.

04:08.720 --> 04:12.320
The most profitable films don't tend to be very original.

04:12.320 --> 04:15.200
While it's somewhat amusing to see adaptations

04:15.200 --> 04:19.200
reproduce their source material with varying degrees of faithfulness,

04:19.200 --> 04:21.760
it's tough to ignore that most of the heavy lifting

04:21.760 --> 04:25.360
to establish these brands had already been done long ago.

04:25.360 --> 04:28.720
In general, audiences are drawn to what's familiar.

04:28.720 --> 04:32.160
This logic applies to adaptations as well as sequels,

04:32.160 --> 04:35.840
which over time have become even bigger cash cows.

04:35.840 --> 04:42.160
The original Top Gun is not among the top 20 highest earners, but the 2022 sequel is.

04:42.160 --> 04:45.680
The same is true for Jurassic Park, Fast and the Furious,

04:45.680 --> 04:49.840
and even the uncanny live-action Lion King reboot which nobody likes

04:49.840 --> 04:52.240
but everyone paid to go see apparently.

04:52.240 --> 04:56.320
Of course, Disney are the kings of getting value out of their properties.

04:56.320 --> 05:01.200
They were the first studio to embrace the newest money-making strategy in Hollywood.

05:01.200 --> 05:05.520
String together enough sequels and spin-offs and you get a cinematic universe

05:05.520 --> 05:08.960
where each release induces demand on the others.

05:08.960 --> 05:13.840
And with that, we've pretty much filled out the whole list, except for the very top.

05:16.960 --> 05:22.480
As of 2023, the highest grossing film of all time is James Cameron's Avatar,

05:22.480 --> 05:27.760
which reclaimed the number one spot from the Avengers after its re-release last year.

05:27.760 --> 05:33.280
In fact, Cameron was in the director's seat for three of the top five box office milestones

05:33.280 --> 05:36.880
For a list otherwise dominated by recycled concepts,

05:36.880 --> 05:42.160
Avatar was unique in being a totally new experience when it debuted in theaters.

05:42.160 --> 05:48.480
Business-wise, it was by far the most ambitious, spanning 15 years from concept to execution

05:48.480 --> 05:52.560
and making the absolute most of the technology at its disposal.

05:52.560 --> 05:56.480
Sometimes a little risk is necessary to earn the greatest reward.

05:58.320 --> 06:02.560
So far, Avatar has grossed just under three billion dollars,

06:02.560 --> 06:05.680
with an official budget of 237 million.

06:05.680 --> 06:08.880
It produced returns of about 12 to 1,

06:08.880 --> 06:13.680
meaning that if for whatever reason you had invested a hundred dollars into the project,

06:13.680 --> 06:16.400
you would have gotten back about 1200.

06:16.400 --> 06:20.080
Here we find a different way of looking at a movie's profitability.

06:20.080 --> 06:23.200
While Avatar made the most total money of any film,

06:23.200 --> 06:26.320
it was far from the highest return on investment.

06:26.320 --> 06:30.320
Exploring the top of this metric puts us in an entirely different ballgame.

06:33.440 --> 06:41.040
For years, the biggest profit margin in cinema was attributed to the 1972 pornographic film Deep Throat.

06:41.040 --> 06:47.840
On just a $47,000 budget, the project at one point reported earnings of up to 600 million,

06:47.840 --> 06:52.320
which would have put it in the same league as Star Wars in terms of ticket sales.

06:52.320 --> 06:57.200
However, historical consensus has shed serious doubt on this claim.

06:57.200 --> 07:02.480
It turns out that the movie was distributed primarily through mafia-controlled theaters.

07:02.480 --> 07:07.760
Meaning that its revenue was more than likely propped up by various other streams of income.

07:08.400 --> 07:12.000
Experts now estimate that the film made just 50 million,

07:12.000 --> 07:15.840
which still equates to an impressive return of a thousand to one.

07:16.560 --> 07:18.720
As for more conventional films,

07:18.720 --> 07:23.520
the rest of the 70s marked a golden age for hyper-profitable projects.

07:23.520 --> 07:29.360
Rocky turned a budget of a million dollars into a 225 million dollar box office.

07:29.360 --> 07:33.360
The original Mad Max earned 100 million off 400,000.

07:33.360 --> 07:38.800
Bruce Lee's Way of the Dragon made 130 million off just 130,000.

07:38.800 --> 07:44.960
But out of all the low-budget heroes, by far the greatest number could be found in the horror genre.

07:44.960 --> 07:49.200
The remarkable success of films like Halloween, Friday the 13th,

07:49.200 --> 07:54.560
and Texas Chainsaw Massacre cemented horror as the format to do more with less.

07:54.560 --> 07:59.680
And starting in 1993, a pair of students from the University of Central Florida

07:59.680 --> 08:02.640
hashed a plan to make the next sleeper hit.

08:02.640 --> 08:06.560
An endeavor that would eventually be known as the Blair Witch Project.

08:12.080 --> 08:16.960
It's the story of three amateur filmmakers investigating a local superstition in the

08:16.960 --> 08:23.600
Maryland wilderness. After venturing too far off course, their situation rapidly deteriorates.

08:23.600 --> 08:28.000
Before long, it's clear that they've stumbled into unwelcome territory.

08:28.000 --> 08:32.800
Miles away from civilization, they make the disturbing discovery that they're not alone

08:32.800 --> 08:39.360
in the woods. These days, Blair Witch is known as one of the defining horror sensations of its time.

08:39.360 --> 08:42.800
Far less known, however, are the incredible lengths its creators

08:42.800 --> 08:46.160
went through to keep its production as inexpensive as possible.

08:47.040 --> 08:52.080
When making a movie, there are three extenuating variables that will tend to eat up most of your

08:52.080 --> 08:58.400
budget. The first and most obvious is manpower. Every aspect of production, from lighting to

08:58.400 --> 09:04.080
wardrobe to set design, often requires its own specialized team of artists and technicians.

09:04.080 --> 09:09.440
It's not uncommon for even small-scale projects to require a headcount in the hundreds.

09:09.440 --> 09:14.240
As filming drags on, all those names in the credits quickly drive up the bill.

09:14.240 --> 09:18.880
And if that wasn't enough, every one of those people are probably working with some kind of

09:18.880 --> 09:24.800
expensive technology that also has to be factored into the budget. Modern films are expected to

09:24.800 --> 09:30.960
look a certain way and adhere to strict standards of technical proficiency. If the pictures, sound,

09:30.960 --> 09:36.080
or special effects come off as too sloppy, the audience may end up dismissing the project

09:36.080 --> 09:42.320
entirely. Therefore, respectable films practically need sophisticated equipment before they can be

09:42.320 --> 09:47.600
taken seriously, which doesn't come cheap. But even if a movie meets all the technical

09:47.600 --> 09:53.440
specifications, audiences can still end up rejecting it when the creative aspects fall flat.

09:53.440 --> 10:00.000
It's easy to scoff at how much money A-list actors rake in, but as is the case with any industry,

10:00.000 --> 10:06.080
the best of the best tend to come at a premium. If you want a job done well, you need to invest

10:06.080 --> 10:11.200
in high-end talent. Altogether, these are the most inescapable roadblocks to any film's

10:11.200 --> 10:17.120
profitability. A production can consider itself lucky if it can manage to dodge just one of them.

10:17.120 --> 10:23.120
Remarkably, Blair Witch figured out a way to circumvent all three. To accomplish this,

10:23.120 --> 10:29.200
they would tap into the dark arts of found footage. The technique can be traced back to

10:29.200 --> 10:34.560
the infamous Italian horror film Cannibal Holocaust. It's a film that's been used for

10:35.520 --> 10:40.960
It presents an unorthodox method of storytelling in which the events of the plot are shot by the

10:40.960 --> 10:47.120
on-screen characters. For years, the style was mostly limited to niche experimental films,

10:47.120 --> 10:52.400
but Blair Witch would be the first to utilize it in a strategic way. Because when it comes

10:52.400 --> 10:58.800
to profitability, found footage is a cinematic cheat code. When Merrick and Sanchez began the

10:58.800 --> 11:05.760
casting process in 1996, they were only interested in two criteria, improvisational skill

11:05.760 --> 11:11.120
and basic experience with operating cameras. Eventually, they narrowed down their search to

11:11.120 --> 11:16.400
three candidates, Heather Donohue, Michael Williams, and Joshua Leonard. The trio were

11:16.400 --> 11:22.320
given a rather unique responsibility. They weren't just the stars of the show. They were basically in

11:22.320 --> 11:27.520
charge of creating everything we saw on screen. During principal photography, pretty much the

11:27.520 --> 11:33.040
only manpower working on the film were these three people. In fact, the directors were not

11:33.040 --> 11:38.160
even present while most of the filming took place. While working under no supervision,

11:38.160 --> 11:44.560
the actors' performances were entirely spontaneous. The script for the project contained no dialogue,

11:44.560 --> 11:50.160
as every conversation was intended to be improvised on the spot. Giving the actors so much

11:50.160 --> 11:55.520
liberty over the production process drastically cut down on labor costs, but where the found

11:55.520 --> 12:01.600
footage method really shines is its flexibility with inexpensive equipment. The very premise of

12:01.600 --> 12:07.920
the genre provides a diegetic excuse for a lo-fi presentation. The picture quality can look

12:07.920 --> 12:13.520
unprofessional because that's how the characters within the story shot it. Most of Blair Witch was

12:13.520 --> 12:20.880
filmed on a Hi8 camcorder, which retailed for only $300 at the time. Although it was far below the

12:20.880 --> 12:26.800
standard expected from feature films, it works within the specific context of found footage.

12:27.600 --> 12:33.120
With the cost of labor and equipment now taken care of, the filmmakers had only one problem left

12:33.120 --> 12:38.800
to worry about. They had to elicit convincing performances out of the inexperienced cast.

12:38.800 --> 12:44.080
For such a low-budget project, they could only really draw from a pool of unknowns. With the

12:44.080 --> 12:50.080
skill of the actors being a major question mark, the directors came up with an ingenious solution.

12:50.080 --> 12:55.440
While there were no guarantees that the cast would bring realism to the film, the film could

12:55.440 --> 13:01.120
bring realism to the cast. During most of the shoot, the actors were placed in the same environment

13:01.120 --> 13:06.720
that their characters were intended to experience. To simulate the real impression of being alone in

13:06.720 --> 13:12.240
the woods, the filmmakers decided to limit their interactions with the cast as much as possible.

13:12.240 --> 13:16.800
Most of the communication was done through written directions that were placed at pre-arranged

13:16.800 --> 13:22.560
locations in the woods. The actors were often instructed to traverse long distances in real

13:22.560 --> 13:28.160
time, which led to actual instances of them getting lost. Furthermore, the actors were not

13:28.160 --> 13:33.600
informed of upcoming plot points. Many of the most pivotal scenes truly showed them reacting to

13:33.600 --> 13:38.880
unnerving events for the first time. Needless to say, several straight days of sleeping in the

13:38.880 --> 13:44.160
woods and getting legitimately spooked by the directors left the cast quite exhausted. By the

13:44.160 --> 13:49.280
end of it all, they really were desperate to return home. While it was far from the most

13:49.280 --> 13:54.560
comfortable experience, the strategy certainly made the performances more convincing. And with

13:54.560 --> 13:59.040
that, pretty much all the footage that would appear in the final product was complete.

13:59.040 --> 14:05.760
At this point, the total budget was estimated to be less than $25,000. In the following months,

14:05.760 --> 14:11.280
the directors gradually whittled down 20 hours of raw footage into the 81-minute final cut.

14:11.840 --> 14:15.040
After more than five years since its initial conception,

14:15.040 --> 14:19.520
The Blair Witch Project was finished. Now all it needed was an audience.

14:22.960 --> 14:28.800
In the film industry, making the movie itself is only half the battle. Before any production

14:28.800 --> 14:34.160
can turn a profit, people need to have a reason to go see it. Throughout the history of cinema,

14:34.160 --> 14:38.480
there are countless examples of excellent products that ultimately flopped because of

14:38.480 --> 14:43.280
poor marketing. It's a process made even more challenging with a limited budget,

14:43.280 --> 14:49.600
as conventional venues for advertising become inaccessible. Without backing from major studios,

14:49.600 --> 14:54.240
independent films often have to rely on guerrilla tactics to generate interest,

14:54.240 --> 14:58.640
and Blair Witch was no different. While approaching the marketing problem,

14:58.640 --> 15:02.640
the filmmakers would stumble upon their greatest stroke of genius yet.

15:03.200 --> 15:08.880
Ordinarily, a sluggish production is not ideal, but in the case of Blair Witch, it happened to

15:08.880 --> 15:14.800
work precisely in their favor. The film's lengthy development time allowed its release to coincide

15:14.800 --> 15:20.160
perfectly with the rise of the internet, and as luck would have it, this radical grassroots

15:20.160 --> 15:25.520
project would be the first to harness its true power. In earlier drafts of the film,

15:25.520 --> 15:30.640
the directors had planned to present the story through a pseudo-documentary format.

15:30.640 --> 15:35.680
The angle was eventually scrapped for pacing reasons, but the documentary segments would

15:35.680 --> 15:41.760
find far greater use elsewhere. They ended up being repurposed and reformatted for television.

15:41.760 --> 15:46.560
More than a year ahead of its release, the myth of the Blair Witch would be quietly introduced

15:46.560 --> 15:52.240
over the American airwaves. The promotional material would appear just twice, first as a

15:52.240 --> 15:57.360
10-minute segment on the Bravo series split screen, then as an hour-long standalone special

15:57.360 --> 16:03.200
on the sci-fi network. While the spotlight was short-lived, it was still incredibly effective.

16:03.200 --> 16:08.960
Overnight, the filmmakers had succeeded in turning the fictional Blair Witch into a real-life urban

16:08.960 --> 16:14.880
legend. At a time when rumors ran wild on online message boards, the premise of the film became the

16:14.880 --> 16:20.560
subject of intense speculation. The American public had no concept of found footage at this

16:20.560 --> 16:26.160
point, leading many to believe that the events of the documentaries were real. The scale of the

16:26.160 --> 16:32.160
campaign became clear when the film opened its own website and received 160 million visitors,

16:32.160 --> 16:36.960
the majority of which truly believed they had uncovered an actual missing persons case.

16:37.680 --> 16:42.880
Out of basically nothing, the filmmakers had transformed a totally unknown brand into one of

16:42.880 --> 16:48.800
the most highly anticipated prospects in cinema. Following its premiere at Sundance, the Blair Witch

16:48.800 --> 16:55.520
project was immediately picked up for theatrical release. In August of 1999, the film would play in

16:55.600 --> 17:00.800
thousands of theaters around the nation and many more around the world. By the end of its run,

17:00.800 --> 17:06.480
Blair Witch had grossed just shy of a quarter billion dollars. Off of an official budget of

17:06.480 --> 17:15.360
just 60,000, it produced an astounding return of 4,144 to one. If you had invested a hundred

17:15.360 --> 17:21.040
dollars into this movie, it would have paid out the value of a new house. Upon release,

17:21.040 --> 17:25.600
The Blair Witch Project was by far the most profitable film ever made.

17:26.640 --> 17:32.240
Up until now, we've only discussed the business end of filmmaking, but the true value of movies

17:32.240 --> 17:37.520
extends far beyond the balance sheet. The history of Hollywood has seen no shortage of shameless

17:37.520 --> 17:43.040
cash grabs, mediocre junk that everyone forgets about as soon as they walk out of the theater.

17:43.040 --> 17:48.080
The films we end up remembering do more than just make money. Perhaps the most surprising

17:48.080 --> 17:53.280
thing about the most profitable film in cinema is that it was actually good. Oddly enough,

17:53.280 --> 17:58.800
there is very little fanfare surrounding Blair Witch today and it rarely comes up in discussions

17:58.800 --> 18:04.240
of the most iconic horror films. This is probably due to the split reception it received from

18:04.240 --> 18:10.320
audiences at the time. After more than a year of intense hype, many viewers found the final product

18:10.320 --> 18:15.440
underwhelming. Much of the disappointment stemmed from the simple realization that the events of the

18:15.440 --> 18:20.720
film weren't actually real. While this led much of the general public to dismiss its merit,

18:20.720 --> 18:26.240
critics saw things differently. In a time of stagnation for the horror genre, Blair Witch

18:26.240 --> 18:31.600
represented something truly new. The handheld amateur camera work provided a more intimate

18:31.600 --> 18:37.200
sense of immersion that felt unique and refreshing. The film makes great use of tension, gradually

18:37.200 --> 18:42.400
escalating the conflict without ever revealing too much. Throughout the story, the true nature

18:42.400 --> 18:47.440
of the Blair Witch is kept ambiguous. When presented with the possibility of changing the

18:47.440 --> 18:53.040
film's final scene, the directors ultimately decided to keep what they had shot originally,

18:53.040 --> 18:58.880
the ending that left the audience with the most room for interpretation. This open-ended mystique

18:58.880 --> 19:04.000
has allowed the film to age gracefully. To this day, there's still a debate over whether the

19:04.000 --> 19:10.240
characters truly experienced anything supernatural. Perhaps this movie's greatest success is making us

19:10.240 --> 19:16.160
realize how frightening it can be to simply let our imaginations run wild. I think the late Roger

19:16.160 --> 19:22.160
Ebert put it best in his review of the film. At a time when digital techniques can show us almost

19:22.160 --> 19:27.520
anything, the Blair Witch project is a reminder that what really scares us is the stuff we can't

19:27.520 --> 19:33.600
see. But as for the movie's overall legacy, the only thing most people did see was its eye-popping

19:33.600 --> 19:39.440
financial success. Naturally, it was bound to spawn some imitators, and in the following years,

19:39.440 --> 19:45.360
the found-footage genre briefly became Hollywood's newest gold rush. Out of these new challengers,

19:45.360 --> 19:51.840
the most successful were J.J. Abrams' Cloverfield and the Paranormal Activity franchise. In fact,

19:51.840 --> 19:57.040
depending on how you factor in post-production costs, the original Paranormal Activity has

19:57.040 --> 20:02.640
a claim to the title of the most profitable film. But the way I see it, it's hard not to respect

20:02.640 --> 20:08.640
what came before. Thus far, no other film has really topped Blair Witch as the defining piece

20:08.640 --> 20:14.400
of the genre. You can chalk up its success to a perfect storm of events, how it benefited from

20:14.400 --> 20:19.680
a series of extremely lucky breaks that will never be replicated. But at the end of the day, when you

20:19.680 --> 20:25.280
look beyond the pomp and circumstance, the Blair Witch project deserves to stand on its own as a

20:25.280 --> 20:35.200
good product. Even now, 25 years later, it still has a lot to teach us. Despite a few home runs,

20:35.200 --> 20:41.120
2023 has been one of the most unprofitable years for Hollywood. And while many are quick to blame

20:41.120 --> 20:47.040
the actors and writers' strike for this, it doesn't really tell the whole story. For many years now,

20:47.040 --> 20:52.080
the industry's tried and true money-making formulas have been backfiring. It appears that

20:52.080 --> 20:58.160
the days of simply pumping out recognizable IPs might be over. Modern cinema has found itself at

20:58.160 --> 21:03.520
a crossroads where not even Disney can seem to figure out what to do anymore. Somewhere along

21:03.520 --> 21:09.360
the way, the business end of filmmaking got too optimized for its own good. Throughout Hollywood's

21:09.360 --> 21:15.120
obsession of making movies more profitable, they forgot how to make them valuable. If you really

21:15.120 --> 21:20.160
think about it, having people pay to watch a bunch of imaginary moving pictures is a pretty

21:20.160 --> 21:25.680
nonsensical business model. If it's money you're after, you'd be far better off selling drugs,

21:25.680 --> 21:31.440
drilling oil, or defrauding investors. After a while, movies have to be more than yet another

21:31.440 --> 21:36.880
means to an end. Cinema was built off the backs of the gunslingers, the risk takers,

21:36.880 --> 21:41.840
the visionaries who showed the rest of the world what no one else could see. The greatest

21:41.840 --> 21:46.880
filmmakers are defined not by the money they produce, but the magic they create using what

21:46.880 --> 21:52.480
little they have to work with. If Hollywood wants to turn things around, they're gonna have to learn

21:52.480 --> 21:58.720
how to be more resourceful. The way things are headed now, they might be left with no other choice.

21:58.720 --> 22:02.720
The future of cinema may be uncertain, but if there's one silver lining,

22:02.720 --> 22:07.120
it's that the hardest times often lead to the greatest inspiration.
