1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,800
What is the point of making movies?

2
00:00:02,800 --> 00:00:05,040
There are many answers to this question,

3
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:07,840
ranging from the creative to the persuasive.

4
00:00:07,840 --> 00:00:09,280
But in this day and age,

5
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:14,480
the motivations of the film industry at large come down to something far more cynical.

6
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:19,120
The truth is that the average movie only sees the light of day for one reason.

7
00:00:19,120 --> 00:00:21,760
Another five-letter word that starts with M.

8
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:27,440
Uh-oh, looks like we just ran out of funding.

9
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,760
Well, I guess we better queue up some coming attractions.

10
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:40,880
Do you remember Opera?

11
00:00:40,880 --> 00:00:43,520
What, that web browser we used to use as kids?

12
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:44,080
They're back.

13
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:50,480
Check it out, they got this new integrated AI called ARIA.

14
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:54,960
It's so smart, I can physically feel my IQ rising by using this thing!

15
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:57,920
ARIA, give me tomorrow's lottery numbers.

16
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:01,920
One browser is more secure than the rest.

17
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:05,680
I don't know, he locked himself in his room.

18
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:08,560
Kind of like how Opera locks down their users' privacy.

19
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:11,440
One browser is more lucid than the rest.

20
00:01:11,440 --> 00:01:14,080
Looks like they added this thing called Lucid Mode.

21
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:18,880
It makes digital experiences more lifelike, almost as if they're real.

22
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:21,840
One browser will reign supreme.

23
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:24,320
I'm starting to get concerned about Rusty.

24
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:26,480
He hasn't left his house in three days,

25
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:31,280
and the last thing he mentioned to me was something about becoming one with Opera.

26
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:32,320
This winter...

27
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:34,480
Open the studio doors, ARIA.

28
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:35,760
It ain't over.

29
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:37,600
I'm hiding in the woods right now.

30
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:39,120
It's the only place it can't get me.

31
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:40,480
Oh my god.

32
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:42,400
What is that?

33
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:44,880
To the Virtual Lady Sings.

34
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:46,800
What is happening?

35
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:49,120
They put me in the computer!

36
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:50,000
Starring...

37
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Built-in VPN, ad blocker, sidebar music player, and inorganizable tabs.

38
00:01:57,120 --> 00:01:59,760
At last, I have found her.

39
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:02,880
Introducing Opera.

40
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:05,440
Coming soon to you.

41
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:08,400
Download today using the link below.

42
00:02:09,760 --> 00:02:15,120
It's easy to get carried away by the stardom and spectacle that Hollywood blockbusters provide,

43
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:16,800
but make no mistake about it.

44
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:20,160
These things exist to serve a very specific purpose.

45
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:24,240
No different from that of a McDonald's cheeseburger or a can of Coke.

46
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:28,400
The vast majority of movies are designed to be consumer products.

47
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:32,400
They are a tool used by corporations to generate profit.

48
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:37,360
The most fundamental aspect of business is being able to make more than you spend.

49
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:40,080
And before a single frame of film is shot,

50
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:45,760
its investors must have confidence that whatever their funding is an asset and not a liability.

51
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:48,960
Despite fulfilling the same general economic function,

52
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:53,840
the way in which films make their money is unique to most other consumer goods.

53
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:57,360
A single successful movie is potentially more valuable than

54
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:00,800
selling 10,000 cars or 10 million sandwiches.

55
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:03,920
With so much revenue tied up in just one product,

56
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:08,160
it completely changes the way in which producers have to approach risk.

57
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:12,880
The dreaded box office bomb can be as destructive as its name suggests.

58
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:15,680
The industry's biggest flops have ruined careers,

59
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:20,880
bankrupted companies and have even led to the extinction of entire genres of storytelling.

60
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:24,320
Most Hollywood studios hesitate to swing for the fences

61
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:27,760
because the risk of striking out is often catastrophic.

62
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:31,920
Keeping the playbook safe and predictable is usually what's best for business,

63
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:35,200
even if it comes at the cost of artistic integrity.

64
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:40,320
There's no need to reinvent the wheel when the formula for success is already set in stone.

65
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:45,600
The highest grossing films in history tend to have a few things in common.

66
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:51,440
As it turns out, 2023 has seen not one but two new entries to the coveted list.

67
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:56,320
The Mario movie featuring the most recognizable video game mascot of all time

68
00:03:56,320 --> 00:04:01,200
and the Barbie movie featuring the most recognizable toy mascot of all time.

69
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:06,480
When you add in Harry Potter, the most recognizable literary mascot of the 21st century,

70
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:08,720
you may start to notice a pattern.

71
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:12,320
The most profitable films don't tend to be very original.

72
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:15,200
While it's somewhat amusing to see adaptations

73
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:19,200
reproduce their source material with varying degrees of faithfulness,

74
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:21,760
it's tough to ignore that most of the heavy lifting

75
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:25,360
to establish these brands had already been done long ago.

76
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:28,720
In general, audiences are drawn to what's familiar.

77
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:32,160
This logic applies to adaptations as well as sequels,

78
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:35,840
which over time have become even bigger cash cows.

79
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:42,160
The original Top Gun is not among the top 20 highest earners, but the 2022 sequel is.

80
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:45,680
The same is true for Jurassic Park, Fast and the Furious,

81
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:49,840
and even the uncanny live-action Lion King reboot which nobody likes

82
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:52,240
but everyone paid to go see apparently.

83
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:56,320
Of course, Disney are the kings of getting value out of their properties.

84
00:04:56,320 --> 00:05:01,200
They were the first studio to embrace the newest money-making strategy in Hollywood.

85
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:05,520
String together enough sequels and spin-offs and you get a cinematic universe

86
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:08,960
where each release induces demand on the others.

87
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:13,840
And with that, we've pretty much filled out the whole list, except for the very top.

88
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:22,480
As of 2023, the highest grossing film of all time is James Cameron's Avatar,

89
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:27,760
which reclaimed the number one spot from the Avengers after its re-release last year.

90
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:33,280
In fact, Cameron was in the director's seat for three of the top five box office milestones

91
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:36,880
For a list otherwise dominated by recycled concepts,

92
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:42,160
Avatar was unique in being a totally new experience when it debuted in theaters.

93
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:48,480
Business-wise, it was by far the most ambitious, spanning 15 years from concept to execution

94
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:52,560
and making the absolute most of the technology at its disposal.

95
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:56,480
Sometimes a little risk is necessary to earn the greatest reward.

96
00:05:58,320 --> 00:06:02,560
So far, Avatar has grossed just under three billion dollars,

97
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:05,680
with an official budget of 237 million.

98
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:08,880
It produced returns of about 12 to 1,

99
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:13,680
meaning that if for whatever reason you had invested a hundred dollars into the project,

100
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:16,400
you would have gotten back about 1200.

101
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:20,080
Here we find a different way of looking at a movie's profitability.

102
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:23,200
While Avatar made the most total money of any film,

103
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:26,320
it was far from the highest return on investment.

104
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:30,320
Exploring the top of this metric puts us in an entirely different ballgame.

105
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:41,040
For years, the biggest profit margin in cinema was attributed to the 1972 pornographic film Deep Throat.

106
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:47,840
On just a $47,000 budget, the project at one point reported earnings of up to 600 million,

107
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:52,320
which would have put it in the same league as Star Wars in terms of ticket sales.

108
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:57,200
However, historical consensus has shed serious doubt on this claim.

109
00:06:57,200 --> 00:07:02,480
It turns out that the movie was distributed primarily through mafia-controlled theaters.

110
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:07,760
Meaning that its revenue was more than likely propped up by various other streams of income.

111
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:12,000
Experts now estimate that the film made just 50 million,

112
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,840
which still equates to an impressive return of a thousand to one.

113
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:18,720
As for more conventional films,

114
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:23,520
the rest of the 70s marked a golden age for hyper-profitable projects.

115
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:29,360
Rocky turned a budget of a million dollars into a 225 million dollar box office.

116
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:33,360
The original Mad Max earned 100 million off 400,000.

117
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:38,800
Bruce Lee's Way of the Dragon made 130 million off just 130,000.

118
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:44,960
But out of all the low-budget heroes, by far the greatest number could be found in the horror genre.

119
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:49,200
The remarkable success of films like Halloween, Friday the 13th,

120
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:54,560
and Texas Chainsaw Massacre cemented horror as the format to do more with less.

121
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:59,680
And starting in 1993, a pair of students from the University of Central Florida

122
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:02,640
hashed a plan to make the next sleeper hit.

123
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:06,560
An endeavor that would eventually be known as the Blair Witch Project.

124
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:16,960
It's the story of three amateur filmmakers investigating a local superstition in the

125
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:23,600
Maryland wilderness. After venturing too far off course, their situation rapidly deteriorates.

126
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:28,000
Before long, it's clear that they've stumbled into unwelcome territory.

127
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:32,800
Miles away from civilization, they make the disturbing discovery that they're not alone

128
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:39,360
in the woods. These days, Blair Witch is known as one of the defining horror sensations of its time.

129
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:42,800
Far less known, however, are the incredible lengths its creators

130
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:46,160
went through to keep its production as inexpensive as possible.

131
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:52,080
When making a movie, there are three extenuating variables that will tend to eat up most of your

132
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:58,400
budget. The first and most obvious is manpower. Every aspect of production, from lighting to

133
00:08:58,400 --> 00:09:04,080
wardrobe to set design, often requires its own specialized team of artists and technicians.

134
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:09,440
It's not uncommon for even small-scale projects to require a headcount in the hundreds.

135
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:14,240
As filming drags on, all those names in the credits quickly drive up the bill.

136
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:18,880
And if that wasn't enough, every one of those people are probably working with some kind of

137
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:24,800
expensive technology that also has to be factored into the budget. Modern films are expected to

138
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:30,960
look a certain way and adhere to strict standards of technical proficiency. If the pictures, sound,

139
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:36,080
or special effects come off as too sloppy, the audience may end up dismissing the project

140
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:42,320
entirely. Therefore, respectable films practically need sophisticated equipment before they can be

141
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:47,600
taken seriously, which doesn't come cheap. But even if a movie meets all the technical

142
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:53,440
specifications, audiences can still end up rejecting it when the creative aspects fall flat.

143
00:09:53,440 --> 00:10:00,000
It's easy to scoff at how much money A-list actors rake in, but as is the case with any industry,

144
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:06,080
the best of the best tend to come at a premium. If you want a job done well, you need to invest

145
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:11,200
in high-end talent. Altogether, these are the most inescapable roadblocks to any film's

146
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:17,120
profitability. A production can consider itself lucky if it can manage to dodge just one of them.

147
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:23,120
Remarkably, Blair Witch figured out a way to circumvent all three. To accomplish this,

148
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:29,200
they would tap into the dark arts of found footage. The technique can be traced back to

149
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:34,560
the infamous Italian horror film Cannibal Holocaust. It's a film that's been used for

150
00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:40,960
It presents an unorthodox method of storytelling in which the events of the plot are shot by the

151
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:47,120
on-screen characters. For years, the style was mostly limited to niche experimental films,

152
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:52,400
but Blair Witch would be the first to utilize it in a strategic way. Because when it comes

153
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:58,800
to profitability, found footage is a cinematic cheat code. When Merrick and Sanchez began the

154
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:05,760
casting process in 1996, they were only interested in two criteria, improvisational skill

155
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:11,120
and basic experience with operating cameras. Eventually, they narrowed down their search to

156
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:16,400
three candidates, Heather Donohue, Michael Williams, and Joshua Leonard. The trio were

157
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:22,320
given a rather unique responsibility. They weren't just the stars of the show. They were basically in

158
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:27,520
charge of creating everything we saw on screen. During principal photography, pretty much the

159
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:33,040
only manpower working on the film were these three people. In fact, the directors were not

160
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:38,160
even present while most of the filming took place. While working under no supervision,

161
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:44,560
the actors' performances were entirely spontaneous. The script for the project contained no dialogue,

162
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:50,160
as every conversation was intended to be improvised on the spot. Giving the actors so much

163
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:55,520
liberty over the production process drastically cut down on labor costs, but where the found

164
00:11:55,520 --> 00:12:01,600
footage method really shines is its flexibility with inexpensive equipment. The very premise of

165
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:07,920
the genre provides a diegetic excuse for a lo-fi presentation. The picture quality can look

166
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:13,520
unprofessional because that's how the characters within the story shot it. Most of Blair Witch was

167
00:12:13,520 --> 00:12:20,880
filmed on a Hi8 camcorder, which retailed for only $300 at the time. Although it was far below the

168
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:26,800
standard expected from feature films, it works within the specific context of found footage.

169
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:33,120
With the cost of labor and equipment now taken care of, the filmmakers had only one problem left

170
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:38,800
to worry about. They had to elicit convincing performances out of the inexperienced cast.

171
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:44,080
For such a low-budget project, they could only really draw from a pool of unknowns. With the

172
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:50,080
skill of the actors being a major question mark, the directors came up with an ingenious solution.

173
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:55,440
While there were no guarantees that the cast would bring realism to the film, the film could

174
00:12:55,440 --> 00:13:01,120
bring realism to the cast. During most of the shoot, the actors were placed in the same environment

175
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:06,720
that their characters were intended to experience. To simulate the real impression of being alone in

176
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:12,240
the woods, the filmmakers decided to limit their interactions with the cast as much as possible.

177
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:16,800
Most of the communication was done through written directions that were placed at pre-arranged

178
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:22,560
locations in the woods. The actors were often instructed to traverse long distances in real

179
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:28,160
time, which led to actual instances of them getting lost. Furthermore, the actors were not

180
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:33,600
informed of upcoming plot points. Many of the most pivotal scenes truly showed them reacting to

181
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:38,880
unnerving events for the first time. Needless to say, several straight days of sleeping in the

182
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:44,160
woods and getting legitimately spooked by the directors left the cast quite exhausted. By the

183
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:49,280
end of it all, they really were desperate to return home. While it was far from the most

184
00:13:49,280 --> 00:13:54,560
comfortable experience, the strategy certainly made the performances more convincing. And with

185
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:59,040
that, pretty much all the footage that would appear in the final product was complete.

186
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:05,760
At this point, the total budget was estimated to be less than $25,000. In the following months,

187
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:11,280
the directors gradually whittled down 20 hours of raw footage into the 81-minute final cut.

188
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:15,040
After more than five years since its initial conception,

189
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:19,520
The Blair Witch Project was finished. Now all it needed was an audience.

190
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:28,800
In the film industry, making the movie itself is only half the battle. Before any production

191
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:34,160
can turn a profit, people need to have a reason to go see it. Throughout the history of cinema,

192
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:38,480
there are countless examples of excellent products that ultimately flopped because of

193
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:43,280
poor marketing. It's a process made even more challenging with a limited budget,

194
00:14:43,280 --> 00:14:49,600
as conventional venues for advertising become inaccessible. Without backing from major studios,

195
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:54,240
independent films often have to rely on guerrilla tactics to generate interest,

196
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:58,640
and Blair Witch was no different. While approaching the marketing problem,

197
00:14:58,640 --> 00:15:02,640
the filmmakers would stumble upon their greatest stroke of genius yet.

198
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:08,880
Ordinarily, a sluggish production is not ideal, but in the case of Blair Witch, it happened to

199
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:14,800
work precisely in their favor. The film's lengthy development time allowed its release to coincide

200
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:20,160
perfectly with the rise of the internet, and as luck would have it, this radical grassroots

201
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:25,520
project would be the first to harness its true power. In earlier drafts of the film,

202
00:15:25,520 --> 00:15:30,640
the directors had planned to present the story through a pseudo-documentary format.

203
00:15:30,640 --> 00:15:35,680
The angle was eventually scrapped for pacing reasons, but the documentary segments would

204
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:41,760
find far greater use elsewhere. They ended up being repurposed and reformatted for television.

205
00:15:41,760 --> 00:15:46,560
More than a year ahead of its release, the myth of the Blair Witch would be quietly introduced

206
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:52,240
over the American airwaves. The promotional material would appear just twice, first as a

207
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:57,360
10-minute segment on the Bravo series split screen, then as an hour-long standalone special

208
00:15:57,360 --> 00:16:03,200
on the sci-fi network. While the spotlight was short-lived, it was still incredibly effective.

209
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:08,960
Overnight, the filmmakers had succeeded in turning the fictional Blair Witch into a real-life urban

210
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:14,880
legend. At a time when rumors ran wild on online message boards, the premise of the film became the

211
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:20,560
subject of intense speculation. The American public had no concept of found footage at this

212
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:26,160
point, leading many to believe that the events of the documentaries were real. The scale of the

213
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:32,160
campaign became clear when the film opened its own website and received 160 million visitors,

214
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:36,960
the majority of which truly believed they had uncovered an actual missing persons case.

215
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:42,880
Out of basically nothing, the filmmakers had transformed a totally unknown brand into one of

216
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:48,800
the most highly anticipated prospects in cinema. Following its premiere at Sundance, the Blair Witch

217
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:55,520
project was immediately picked up for theatrical release. In August of 1999, the film would play in

218
00:16:55,600 --> 00:17:00,800
thousands of theaters around the nation and many more around the world. By the end of its run,

219
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:06,480
Blair Witch had grossed just shy of a quarter billion dollars. Off of an official budget of

220
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:15,360
just 60,000, it produced an astounding return of 4,144 to one. If you had invested a hundred

221
00:17:15,360 --> 00:17:21,040
dollars into this movie, it would have paid out the value of a new house. Upon release,

222
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:25,600
The Blair Witch Project was by far the most profitable film ever made.

223
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:32,240
Up until now, we've only discussed the business end of filmmaking, but the true value of movies

224
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:37,520
extends far beyond the balance sheet. The history of Hollywood has seen no shortage of shameless

225
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:43,040
cash grabs, mediocre junk that everyone forgets about as soon as they walk out of the theater.

226
00:17:43,040 --> 00:17:48,080
The films we end up remembering do more than just make money. Perhaps the most surprising

227
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:53,280
thing about the most profitable film in cinema is that it was actually good. Oddly enough,

228
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:58,800
there is very little fanfare surrounding Blair Witch today and it rarely comes up in discussions

229
00:17:58,800 --> 00:18:04,240
of the most iconic horror films. This is probably due to the split reception it received from

230
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:10,320
audiences at the time. After more than a year of intense hype, many viewers found the final product

231
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:15,440
underwhelming. Much of the disappointment stemmed from the simple realization that the events of the

232
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:20,720
film weren't actually real. While this led much of the general public to dismiss its merit,

233
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:26,240
critics saw things differently. In a time of stagnation for the horror genre, Blair Witch

234
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:31,600
represented something truly new. The handheld amateur camera work provided a more intimate

235
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:37,200
sense of immersion that felt unique and refreshing. The film makes great use of tension, gradually

236
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:42,400
escalating the conflict without ever revealing too much. Throughout the story, the true nature

237
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:47,440
of the Blair Witch is kept ambiguous. When presented with the possibility of changing the

238
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:53,040
film's final scene, the directors ultimately decided to keep what they had shot originally,

239
00:18:53,040 --> 00:18:58,880
the ending that left the audience with the most room for interpretation. This open-ended mystique

240
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:04,000
has allowed the film to age gracefully. To this day, there's still a debate over whether the

241
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:10,240
characters truly experienced anything supernatural. Perhaps this movie's greatest success is making us

242
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:16,160
realize how frightening it can be to simply let our imaginations run wild. I think the late Roger

243
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:22,160
Ebert put it best in his review of the film. At a time when digital techniques can show us almost

244
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:27,520
anything, the Blair Witch project is a reminder that what really scares us is the stuff we can't

245
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:33,600
see. But as for the movie's overall legacy, the only thing most people did see was its eye-popping

246
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:39,440
financial success. Naturally, it was bound to spawn some imitators, and in the following years,

247
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:45,360
the found-footage genre briefly became Hollywood's newest gold rush. Out of these new challengers,

248
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:51,840
the most successful were J.J. Abrams' Cloverfield and the Paranormal Activity franchise. In fact,

249
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:57,040
depending on how you factor in post-production costs, the original Paranormal Activity has

250
00:19:57,040 --> 00:20:02,640
a claim to the title of the most profitable film. But the way I see it, it's hard not to respect

251
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:08,640
what came before. Thus far, no other film has really topped Blair Witch as the defining piece

252
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:14,400
of the genre. You can chalk up its success to a perfect storm of events, how it benefited from

253
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:19,680
a series of extremely lucky breaks that will never be replicated. But at the end of the day, when you

254
00:20:19,680 --> 00:20:25,280
look beyond the pomp and circumstance, the Blair Witch project deserves to stand on its own as a

255
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:35,200
good product. Even now, 25 years later, it still has a lot to teach us. Despite a few home runs,

256
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:41,120
2023 has been one of the most unprofitable years for Hollywood. And while many are quick to blame

257
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:47,040
the actors and writers' strike for this, it doesn't really tell the whole story. For many years now,

258
00:20:47,040 --> 00:20:52,080
the industry's tried and true money-making formulas have been backfiring. It appears that

259
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:58,160
the days of simply pumping out recognizable IPs might be over. Modern cinema has found itself at

260
00:20:58,160 --> 00:21:03,520
a crossroads where not even Disney can seem to figure out what to do anymore. Somewhere along

261
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:09,360
the way, the business end of filmmaking got too optimized for its own good. Throughout Hollywood's

262
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:15,120
obsession of making movies more profitable, they forgot how to make them valuable. If you really

263
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:20,160
think about it, having people pay to watch a bunch of imaginary moving pictures is a pretty

264
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:25,680
nonsensical business model. If it's money you're after, you'd be far better off selling drugs,

265
00:21:25,680 --> 00:21:31,440
drilling oil, or defrauding investors. After a while, movies have to be more than yet another

266
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:36,880
means to an end. Cinema was built off the backs of the gunslingers, the risk takers,

267
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:41,840
the visionaries who showed the rest of the world what no one else could see. The greatest

268
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:46,880
filmmakers are defined not by the money they produce, but the magic they create using what

269
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:52,480
little they have to work with. If Hollywood wants to turn things around, they're gonna have to learn

270
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:58,720
how to be more resourceful. The way things are headed now, they might be left with no other choice.

271
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:02,720
The future of cinema may be uncertain, but if there's one silver lining,

272
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:07,120
it's that the hardest times often lead to the greatest inspiration.
