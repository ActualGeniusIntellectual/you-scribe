0	6280	Growing up, we get told a lot of legends, but one that's always stuck out to me has been the story of Pandora's Box.
9420	14660	There are numerous religious and spiritual texts which attempt to explain the origin of evil,
14660	18760	the most famous of which can be found in the Bible through the Garden of Eden.
19160	26320	Stories such as these often attribute the fall of man to some sort of wicked being who tempted us into a new sinful reality.
26840	32920	However, the ancient Greeks presented a different interpretation of what really led man to forbidden territory.
33680	38440	Pandora's Box was a box or jar given to Pandora, the first woman on Earth.
38640	43560	The box contained all the evils of the world, such as disease, poverty, and war,
43560	47880	and was accompanied by a warning not to open it under any circumstances.
48400	55160	However, Pandora's curiosity got the better of her, and she opened the box, unleashing all the evils into the world.
55680	63600	The Greek telling of the original sin is rather unique, because it implies that mankind is responsible for its own downfall,
63600	66800	a notion that has only grown more salient over time.
67600	74680	Concerns of man-made doom now pervade our lives more than ever, and are beginning to appear where we least expect them.
75380	81320	The preceding paragraph of voiceover was written by ChatGPT, an AI writing tool
81360	85560	which many suspect will lead to a cascade of unforeseen consequences.
85720	90040	It seems like we are opening a new version of Pandora's Box every day,
90040	94320	and while many may experience this as a distinctly modern dilemma,
94360	98800	it turns out that we've been opening the box for a lot longer than we think.
99160	104280	I suppose you could say that humanity's wayward path began when we departed from the Animal Kingdom.
104800	108520	While we once existed alongside animals as products of nature,
108520	116120	we have since assumed the role of quasi-caretakers, although for centuries, it's hard to say that any care was being taken.
116120	121880	In fact, the natural world had not yet seen a force as ruthlessly destructive as man.
122200	128400	When we put our minds to it, we have the unprecedented ability to single-handedly make other creatures disappear.
128720	132520	Since the advent of human civilization after the end of the last Ice Age,
132960	137440	animals have been going extinct at a rate not seen since the last of the dinosaurs.
137760	141720	While many may attribute this process to our efficient hunting practices,
141720	148240	the main culprit lies in the development of agriculture and the widespread destruction of natural habitats for land clearing.
148560	152800	These damaging practices have resulted in effects which sound almost unfathomable.
154000	160160	At the turn of the 19th century, billions of passenger pigeons blanketed the skies of North America.
160360	164960	Just a hundred and fourteen years later, they had ceased to exist entirely.
165560	171640	The long-term consequences of modern extinction events can be difficult to define on a global scale.
172040	179160	It is primarily through localized ecosystems which we can truly understand the importance of individual species,
179440	183080	a lesson that was taught to us after the removal of the Yellowstone wolves.
187200	194480	One of the most disastrous ecological follies we ever oversaw came about ironically from one of our first attempts at
194840	196720	conservation. In
196720	201120	1872, the US government established the first national park in Yellowstone, Wyoming.
201840	207160	The preserve was intended to provide federal protection of the area's natural resources,
207160	213200	but at a time when our understanding of ecology was still in its infancy, not all nature was treated equally.
214200	217640	Yellowstone happened to be home to an abundant population of gray wolves.
218320	225480	Due to the threat they posed to humans and livestock, early park managers were quick to label the predators as undesirable.
225920	230400	It wasn't long before the Yellowstone wolves were in the crosshairs of a full-scale
230920	238760	eradication campaign. About 50 years after the park's foundation, the entire wolf population had been functionally erased.
239280	244560	Soon after, what was seen as a solution quickly devolved into an even greater problem.
244600	249500	It turns out the wolves were instrumental at keeping the local elk population in check.
249760	256480	With their key predators now absent, the number of elk skyrocketed, resulting in overgrazing of the park's flora.
257000	263020	Acres of forest were no longer allowed to grow as budding saplings were prematurely eaten. The waning
263280	267360	vegetation could no longer anchor the terrain which began to erode away.
268080	274400	Local beavers couldn't find enough wood to build their dams, altering the constitution of the park's rivers and streams.
274800	279420	In their time, the Yellowstone wolves only represented several hundred organisms.
279420	283600	It must have been easy to dismiss their presence as inconsequential.
283880	290060	What we failed to realize is the role they played in a finely tuned equilibrium that persisted for millennia.
290840	295680	Disrupting even a single component was enough to throw the entire ecosystem out of balance.
295880	301800	By the 1990s, the park had fallen into such disarray that a new population of wolves had to be
302040	304540	reintroduced in an attempt to reverse the damages.
304720	311000	The fiasco would serve as a hard lesson that the natural world is often far more complex than we think.
311880	318400	As others would soon discover, adding animals to an ecosystem can be just as destructive as removing them.
318600	324160	In the 1930s, Australian sugar farmers were looking to control the native cane beetle.
324320	329640	Their solution was to introduce the invasive cane toad from the jungles of South America.
330080	337840	Starting with just over a hundred individuals, the Australian cane toad population would eventually balloon to over 200 million.
338160	345040	They now inhabit nearly a quarter of the continent and are actively disrupting other native wildlife on both sides of the food chain.
345840	353200	Adult cane toads secrete deadly toxins from their skin, meaning that not even predators are safe from their hazardous influence.
353560	360400	With no way to limit the population, the toads will likely persist as a constant nuisance into the foreseeable future.
360960	365860	The worst part is, they never had any effect on the beetles they were brought in to stop.
366360	371560	While invasive animals may contribute their fair share of carnage to local ecosystems,
372060	375320	invasive plants have the potential to be even more destructive.
375760	382220	Such is the case with a notorious kudzu vine, which now blankets entire landscapes in the American Southeast.
383180	388100	Originally introduced in the 1870s as an ornamental, the plant would expand aggressively,
388780	392020	rapidly climbing up and over acres of native woodlands.
392100	397720	The vine is so oppressive that it effectively blocks out the sun for all other competing plants,
397980	400860	slowly smothering and killing everything in its path.
401380	408100	Fans of biodiversity should be relieved that kudzu is still mostly limited to the eastern half of the country.
408540	415940	As for the Wild West, they happen to have their own kind of invasive vegetation, one that is already familiar to many of us.
416260	420980	The tumbleweed has long persisted as an iconic symbol of the Western aesthetic.
421060	426740	What many failed to realize, however, is that this peculiar plant is not supposed to be here.
427420	433500	Originating in 1870 from a shipment of Russian flax seeds, the tumbleweed has run roughshod ever since.
434100	440780	Depending on the terrain, they can travel through hundreds of miles of unimpeded wilderness, spreading their seeds along the way.
441220	445840	This creates a mobile threat that is practically impossible to isolate and remove.
446580	451940	Tumbleweeds are very much here to stay, and while they contribute to some rather comedic frustration,
451980	457460	their consequences become much more grim when combined with another common fixture of the West.
457980	465620	In the event that the arid landscape is set ablaze, these unsuspecting plants are suddenly transformed into flaming projectiles,
466180	469060	capable of torching the surrounding area in record time.
469500	474320	It's safe to say that the tumbleweed was probably never meant to exist in America.
474500	479260	It's hard to believe that less than 200 years ago, they weren't even here at all.
479700	485620	The same could be said about Providence Canyon, which is often thought of as a miniature Grand Canyon,
485620	492060	but rather than being forged by nature, this colorful landform can trace its origins back to man-made error.
492660	499580	Starting in the 19th century, a combination of extensive land clearing and poor drainage led to tremendous erosion in an otherwise normal
499900	501900	plot of farmland in the Georgia countryside.
502700	509100	By the 1900s, the subsidence had spawned a gash in the landscape over a hundred feet deep and a mile across.
509940	513540	Today, the canyon exists as an amusing tourist attraction,
513580	520100	but its history serves as a reminder of how even our most simple mistakes have the power to scar the earth itself.
520740	525320	While we have been fortunate to come out of most environmental blunders somewhat unscathed,
525500	529460	we can only ask Mother Nature to take one for the team so often.
530100	536620	Tragically, there is one ecological decision which has likely contributed to more human suffering than any other.
536620	541180	In 1958, Mao Zedong instituted the Four Pests Campaign,
541260	544940	which sought to eradicate unwanted vermin from communist China.
545340	550780	Among the vermin targeted was the sparrow, blamed for disrupting the country's supply of grain.
551300	556260	Over the next two years, the Chinese drove the local sparrow population to near extinction,
557020	562740	going so far as to bang drums for days until the startled birds dropped dead from exhaustion.
563060	568420	After the near total removal of the species, Mao's plan immediately began to backfire.
568620	574060	It turns out that in addition to grain, the sparrows consumed a substantial amount of insects,
574780	580780	particularly locusts. With a major predator out of the picture, the locust population exploded,
581100	584220	resulting in widespread crop failures and food shortages.
584740	590980	After recognizing the severity of the mistake, government officials scrambled to replenish the population,
591060	593060	but the damage was already done.
593340	599620	The decision to exterminate the sparrow was one of several contributing factors of the Great Chinese Famine,
599980	603660	a disaster which led to the deaths of up to 55 million people.
604140	607900	It turns out the leaders of China had a history of tempting fate.
608420	613300	Emperor Qin Shi Huang was notable for unifying China more than 2,000 years ago.
613940	618260	Wanting his reign to last forever, Qin sought out the secret to immortality.
618820	625420	After searching far and wide for the solution, he believed to have found it through an exotic mineral known as cinnabar.
625580	633740	The Emperor spent years drinking the compound by mixing it with his wine, but rather than granting eternal life, it accomplished quite the opposite.
634620	637700	Emperor Qin died prematurely at the age of 49,
638100	643020	most likely from consuming a lethal amount of the element we now know as mercury.
643780	647860	It took us a long time to reach a basic understanding of the chemical world,
648060	651380	an odyssey which led to plenty of mistakes along the way.
651700	657900	We unknowingly interacted with substances like mercury for centuries before discovering their toxic properties.
658460	662820	Mercury in particular causes severe damage to the kidneys, lungs and brain,
663020	666660	with even short-term exposure capable of inducing insanity.
667020	670980	An equally sinister element can be found just one space away from the surface.
670980	680020	Lead. Its chemical symbol is Pb, short for the Latin word plumbum, a name that carries with it a rather disturbing implication.
681020	685860	Plumbum happens to be the root word of plumbing, which is sadly no coincidence.
686220	694100	Due to the soft and malleable properties of lead, it was commonly manufactured in a pipe that delivered drinking water to the Roman people.
694100	699260	When ingested, nearly all lead is trapped within the human body where it remains indefinitely.
699740	706580	Compared to mercury, lead is far less potent. Its detrimental effects on health take much longer to materialize.
706940	714100	Historically, this has allowed the metal to appear deceptively safe, resulting in far greater exposure to the general population.
714620	720740	Now classified as a neurotoxin, lead contamination eventually causes the deterioration of the metal.
720740	724740	Some historians now attribute lead to the sudden collapse of the Roman Empire,
725020	730180	hypothesizing that the leaching of toxins into the population gradually drove them mad.
730740	735220	The frequent industrial use of lead continued all the way into the 20th century,
735620	739980	but didn't reach epidemic proportions until the release of leaded gasoline.
740380	747580	The process of burning tetraethyl lead in combustion engines turned into a major change in the history of the Roman Empire.
747580	754460	The process of burning tetraethyl lead in combustion engines turned the metal into an airborne contaminant through car exhaust.
754980	760140	The chemical became inescapable, effectively poisoning the entire US population.
760700	767500	By 1976, the lead content measured in American blood had risen to more than four times the natural level.
767980	773300	The oil and automobile industries lobbied to keep lead in gasoline for as long as they could,
773380	779740	but eventually, its toxicity was indisputable, and world governments began phasing it out of production.
780180	787940	As leaded fuel was gradually outlawed, what followed was a remarkable trend which illustrated its disturbing effect on the population.
788340	794500	The removal of lead emissions from the environment almost directly correlated with a decrease in violent crime.
795660	800620	Tetraethyl lead was initially developed by chemical engineer Thomas Midgley Jr.,
800980	805180	regarded by many as the single most destructive inventor in human history.
805780	810260	Shockingly, leaded gasoline may not have been the most disastrous part of his legacy.
810980	818220	Midgley was also the father of chlorofluorocarbons, the compound eventually responsible for burning a hole in the ozone layer.
818700	826900	Most people now know this seasonal void over Antarctica as the extent of the damage, but the true influence of CFCs extends much further.
827340	830140	Since its widespread release into the atmosphere,
830140	835820	the chemical has depleted about four percent of the ozone for the entire planet as the
835980	840300	atmospheric layer which shields the surface from harmful ultraviolet radiation.
840300	846700	Its weakening is forecasted to cause an uptick in skin cancer and cataracts for the foreseeable future, and
846940	854780	although CFCs have been mostly phased out, the ozone supply is not expected to fully recover until at least 50 years from now.
855220	861580	The 20th century was truly the point of no return for unleashing a plague of chemicals onto the unsuspecting world.
861940	867940	For decades, highly cancerous PCBs would be recklessly dumped into local water supplies.
868180	875500	A rather egregious offender of such was the Monsanto Chemical Company, which knowingly poisoned the people of Anniston, Alabama.
876260	881780	To this day, the town still has among the highest rates of cancer and birth defects in the nation.
882420	886580	PCBs represented a rather unholy achievement in chemical engineering.
886580	892180	They were one of the first man-made compounds capable of rendering entire places inhospitable.
892540	899380	Even so, they didn't compare to the sheer scope and pervasiveness of another industrial byproduct of the same era,
900060	906820	asbestos. What originated as a naturally occurring mineral quickly began to be used in highly artificial ways.
907140	912220	Its strong insulative properties made the substance an ideal candidate for construction.
912620	918740	By the 1970s, asbestos had become ubiquitous in homes, schools, and hospitals around the world.
919260	926180	It also infiltrated numerous consumer goods, including appliances, cigarettes, makeup, and even baby powder.
927060	934860	Eventually, all who came into contact with the supposed wonder material would soon regret it. When disturbed, asbestos releases long
935260	941620	microscopic fibers which become permanently embedded in lung tissue when inhaled. The substance went on to infect
941860	944740	generations of people with deadly respiratory illness.
945500	952220	Asbestos exposure is attributed to more than a hundred thousand deaths annually. Its lingering presence in pre-existing
952500	958020	infrastructure continues to put people at risk. Long after, most places have banned the stuff entirely.
958420	963780	The most hazardous forms of asbestos have even led to the abandonment of entire towns, as
963940	969980	was the case with Wittenham, Australia, which is set to be totally demolished as of this year.
970780	978220	While there are many contenders, the true title for most hazardous man-made development has to go to another breakthrough of the 20th century,
978780	981740	when humanity crossed over into the nuclear age.
982380	989620	If there was ever something that man was never meant to discover, this was probably it, for it was through splitting the atom
989620	992700	which we inherited unspeakable powers of destruction.
993380	999260	Even in its simplest form, the atomic bomb had already cemented its status as the ultimate weapon, as
999500	1007380	if it wasn't enough to convert an entire city to ash in a matter of seconds. Whatever remain would be irradiated from nuclear fallout,
1007980	1013580	inflicting even more torment on any survivors unlucky enough to wander the hell we left behind.
1014140	1017500	It took just two of these weapons to coerce immediate
1017940	1022260	unconditional surrender from the most zealously unbreakable military on the planet.
1022340	1029420	It was as though we had somehow transcended the abilities of mere mortals, suddenly gaining access to the wrath of gods.
1029980	1034360	To put it more concisely, we had become Death, Destroyer of Worlds.
1034700	1040020	This phrase was infamously spoken by the father of the atomic bomb, J. Robert Oppenheimer,
1040660	1049740	the subject of a highly anticipated biopic releasing this summer. The quotation refers to what ran through his mind at the moment of the Trinity detonation,
1050220	1053060	mankind's very first glimpse into our nuclear future.
1054020	1061300	Oppenheimer's rather ambiguous relationship with his creation has since been met with irreverence by some, often to comedic effect.
1061540	1067260	It's hard to imagine that the architect of a superweapon would feel any sort of sympathy for its victims,
1067300	1072020	but I'd like to believe that when Oppenheimer said this, he wasn't just thinking about Japanese
1072420	1077380	civilians. While gazing into the brilliant fireball that was supposed to signal the end of the war,
1077420	1080540	it's possible that he instead saw the end of everything.
1082900	1084700	With nuclear weapons,
1084700	1091020	humanity had indeed inherited the keys to the kingdom. We had unlocked the sobering ability to destroy ourselves.
1091660	1100180	By the time of Oppenheimer's death in 1967, the world powers had manufactured enough firepower to wipe out most of the population,
1100580	1104820	a stockpile with the potential to transform any ordinary day into Armageddon.
1105500	1112220	Considering our reckless track record with far lower stakes, you have to wonder whether such a responsibility would be too much to handle.
1112620	1118740	Thus far, we have yet to wake up to the nuclear apocalypse, but there have been plenty of very close calls.
1119260	1125740	Every few decades, another reactor meltdown reminds us of just what kind of power we're dealing with. The most
1126100	1134020	catastrophic accidents have rendered certain areas uninhabitable for thousands of years, and this was all while we were trying not to hurt anyone.
1134380	1142220	The Chernobyl exclusion zone, home of the worst nuclear meltdown in history, is estimated to remain irradiated until the year
1142940	1148740	22,000. By then, the area should finally be safe for people to return, although at this rate,
1148740	1155500	it's hard to say whether we'll even be around to see it. As of today, nuclear warfare persists as an unmistakable
1155820	1157620	threat to human existence,
1157620	1161300	but it's far from the only doomsday scenario of the modern age.
1161660	1169020	While much of our paranoia remains focused on the outside world, our true demise could just as easily come from the inside.
1169700	1178460	Although an enormous radioactive mushroom cloud is quite effective at killing people, the same result could be achieved with just a small dose of poison.
1178980	1185660	As opposed to ordinary chemicals, poisons act far more potently by specifically targeting critical body systems.
1186060	1190420	Pound for pound, they are among the most efficiently lethal substances known to man.
1190820	1193060	Perhaps we have come to know them a little too well.
1193660	1200020	For thousands of years, the Japanese have enjoyed a delicacy called fugu, otherwise known as puffer fish.
1200580	1206860	Preparing the dish is considered extremely difficult due to the high amount of tetrodotoxin within most of the fish's body.
1207740	1214140	Improper preparation can easily prove fatal, as even a small amount of the toxin is enough to cause death by asphyxiation.
1215140	1220580	Despite the variety of far safer food available, some people just really like rolling the dice.
1222180	1229660	Tetrodotoxin is only about half as toxic as the deadliest man-made poison ever synthesized, a compound by the name of VX.
1230460	1238420	Originally marketed as a pesticide, its toxicity was so severe that militaries around the world began adopting it for use as a chemical weapon.
1239420	1245460	Eventually, the substance was understood to be so dangerous that not even world governments felt safe producing it.
1245700	1254500	As of 2015, more than 98% of the global supply of VX had been destroyed, a greater reduction than the supply of nuclear weapons.
1254700	1258340	It makes you wonder if we found the toxin to be even more frightening.
1259220	1267260	While human beings have proven to be incredibly skilled at destruction, the world of poison remains one place where nature still has us beat.
1267260	1275060	The venom of the box jellyfish and several species of poison dart frogs has been measured as magnitudes more deadly than anything we've created.
1275260	1281060	The single most poisonous substance ever discovered is produced not by an animal, but bacteria.
1281260	1290060	Botulinum toxin is the most potent neural agent known to man. A dose of just 75 nanograms is enough to kill the average adult.
1290860	1297860	It is the key contributor of botulism, a condition which, left untreated, results in total paralysis of the body.
1298060	1303860	Given all that, you'd think we'd try to avoid it, but remarkably, the opposite is true.
1304060	1311860	Botulinum toxin is actually one of the most heavily demanded poisons in the world due to a cosmetic procedure better known as Botox.
1312060	1318860	As was the case with Emperor Qin, we are still searching for eternal youth by ingesting poison.
1318860	1324660	Bacterial toxins are far from the only microscopic threats that now await us in the modern world.
1324860	1332660	Urbanization and the advancement of global transportation systems has contributed to the unprecedented spread of infectious disease.
1332860	1338660	As many are now exhaustively aware, it no longer takes much to start a worldwide pandemic.
1338860	1343660	The next civilization-altering virus is potentially just a 24-hour plane ride away.
1343660	1347460	Fortunately, the most contagious viruses tend to be the least deadly.
1347660	1353460	When it was all said and done, the coronavirus outbreak resulted in just a 1% fatality rate.
1353660	1359460	For comparison, the 1918 Spanish flu was estimated to have killed up to 10% of the infected.
1359660	1364460	Anything more lethal and you start to enter the murderer's row of pathology.
1364660	1369460	What they lack in contagiousness is more than made up for with pure stopping power.
1369460	1377260	Anthrax, Ebola, and the now eradicated smallpox all have a maximum untreated mortality rate of around 90%.
1377460	1386260	Rabies has a mortality rate of nearly 100% after its symptoms manifest, with only a few cases of survival ever recorded in history.
1386460	1393260	At one point in time, all of these diseases would have been a virtual death sentence, but medical science has since come a long way.
1393260	1399060	Currently, every disease that we're aware of either has a known cure or at least a chance of survival.
1399260	1402060	Every disease, except one.
1402260	1409060	In the 1950s, anthropologists discovered an unusual illness affecting the Fore people of Papua New Guinea.
1409260	1415060	Known by the locals as Kuru, the disease would induce rapid physical and mental deterioration.
1415260	1422060	For years, its origin was a mystery, until scientists started connecting it to the Fore practice of cannibalism.
1422060	1426860	In most cultures, the idea of eating human flesh is an extreme taboo.
1427060	1431860	And as we would soon discover, there's a strong biological reason for that.
1432060	1438860	Kuru is part of a broader classification of disease called transmissible spongiform encephalopathy.
1439060	1445860	The condition stems from misshapen protein molecules known as prions, which bind to and corrupt healthy tissue.
1445860	1454660	Once even a single prion is introduced to the body, it can remain dormant for decades before unleashing an unstoppable cascade of internal damage.
1454860	1459660	Prion disorders are undetectable, incurable and unsurvivable.
1459860	1465660	They are transmitted by ingesting the contaminated flesh of the diseased, which is most often brain matter.
1465860	1470660	So if you want to avoid infection, just stay away from cannibals. Seems simple enough.
1470860	1473660	But what if that cannibal wasn't human?
1473660	1482460	In the 20th century, to cope with skyrocketing meat consumption, cattle farmers sought out cost-effective ways to feed their ever-expanding herds.
1482660	1492460	Eventually, someone came up with the bright idea of mixing the processed remains of dead cows back into the feed, essentially turning the living cows into cannibals.
1492660	1498460	And with cannibalism came a bovine version of Kuru, which is better known as mad cow disease.
1498460	1504260	Prions from the tainted beef would work their way up the food chain and into the mouths of unsuspecting people.
1504460	1509260	Some have called the mad cow outbreak the first truly man-made epidemic.
1509460	1513260	However, it was far from the first plague to come out of animal agriculture.
1513460	1519260	In fact, many of the most destructive diseases in history were transmitted to us from livestock.
1519460	1527260	This circumstance is believed to be the primary reason why European colonization had such a devastating effect on the Native Americans.
1527260	1534060	The colonists had lived in close proximity to domesticated animals for generations and had grown resistant to their diseases.
1534260	1542060	The Native Americans, meanwhile, did not, and couldn't stand a chance against the onslaught of ailments from the old world.
1542260	1551060	Animal-borne diseases have ended civilizations before, but could they do so again, especially versus our modern medical advancements?
1551260	1556060	Well, it turns out that one advancement may soon force us to take a great step backwards.
1556060	1563860	The meat industry is an aggressive user of antibiotics, once considered to be a permanent solution to bacterial infections.
1564060	1567860	In recent times, however, the microbial world has been striking back.
1568060	1573860	The overuse of antibiotics has counterintuitively made certain strains of bacteria stronger.
1574060	1579860	The more we apply the medication, the more likely it is for surviving microbes to develop immunity.
1580660	1588660	As antibiotics continue to be overprescribed to both humans and animals, they run the risk of losing their effectiveness entirely.
1588860	1593660	Experts have long feared the emergence of a superbug which is impervious to any known treatment.
1593860	1600660	Such an outbreak would essentially set us back to pre-industrial times where even a small bacterial infection could prove fatal.
1600860	1607660	This should be especially concerning considering the worst pandemic in history, the bubonic plague, was bacterial.
1608460	1613460	If a similar resistant strain were to arise, we could be powerless to stop it.
1613660	1616460	Such a scenario is hardly far-fetched.
1616660	1625460	Antibiotic-resistant bacteria is already responsible for 700,000 deaths per year, a figure that could rise to 10 million by 2050.
1625660	1633460	There's a misconception that we have left most of our problems in the past, and that we have somehow grown more capable of solving them in the present.
1633460	1641260	It's easy to blame the mistakes of older generations on their ignorance, but it would be naive to suggest that our circumstance today is any different.
1641460	1647260	The truth is that we're still not quite sure how anything we're doing today will affect the future.
1647460	1654260	All of the biggest man-made problems in history only got that way because they weren't obvious when we introduced them.
1654260	1663060	In 1986, an event like Cleveland Balloon Fest was seen as harmless and whimsical fun, while many look back on it today with disturbing unease.
1663260	1671060	Modern concerns of microplastics and the environment have made us reconsider the last 70 years of previously innocuous activities.
1671260	1679060	As of now, the jury's still out on whether plastic pollution is harmful to human health, but for our sake, we had better hope it's not.
1680060	1685860	Microplastics have infiltrated every layer of the food chain down to the air, water and soil.
1686060	1693860	One study suggests that the average person now ingests 5 grams of plastic per week, equivalent to the mass of a credit card.
1694060	1698860	By 2050, the amount of plastic in the ocean is expected to outweigh the amount of fish.
1699060	1706860	Ready or not, plastic debris is now a part of our world, and all we can do is cross our fingers that it has no effect on anything.
1706860	1712660	They said the same thing about asbestos and lead, but surely this time will be the exception.
1712860	1720660	We are still very much in the age of unforeseen consequences, and these days it feels like the price of progress keeps getting steeper.
1720860	1729660	Whether it's the chemicals we keep putting into the environment or our own bodies, it's difficult to not feel at least a little anxious for the future.
1729860	1735660	You have to wonder if we'll ever reach a point where we start creating problems faster than we can fix them.
1735660	1737460	Maybe we're already there.
1737660	1744460	An often neglected part of the legend of Pandora's box is what remained in the box after all the evils were released.
1744660	1752460	The most open-ended part of the story fixates on our interpretation of the Greek word Elpis, most commonly translated as hope.
1752660	1758460	Scholars disagree on whether the inclusion of hope in the box should be considered a blessing or a curse.
1758460	1768260	On one hand it can be seen as the ultimate tool to protect ourselves from the rest of the evils, the lone antidote designed to counteract the wickedness that once imprisoned it.
1768460	1778260	However, a far more pessimistic outlook of the situation sees hope as yet another evil, leading us astray on a path towards salvation that's never coming.
1778460	1787260	It may be convenient to believe that some time down the line, people way smarter than us will just figure it all out and solve everything.
1787260	1792060	Perhaps artificial intelligence will come to the rescue or just add to the problem.
1792260	1797060	Maybe if the Earth gets too polluted we can just evacuate to another world.
1797260	1806060	Hopefully we can do so before the satellites in orbit disintegrate into a deadly debris field that traps us here with all our mistakes forever.
1806260	1810060	In many ways that would probably be the most fitting end to our story.
1811060	1817860	There's a cosmological principle known as the Great Filter which attempts to explain the absence of other intelligent life in the universe.
1818060	1825860	The hypothesis warns of some inevitable barrier which prevents civilizations from expanding beyond a certain level of complexity.
1826060	1836860	It's possible that advanced species reach a point where they become too powerful for their own good, where the enormity of their problems far surpasses the capacity of their intellect to solve them.
1837860	1839660	Are we on our way to getting filtered?
1839860	1845660	As unpleasant of a thought it may be, the arrow of progress only points in one direction.
1845860	1853660	If there is an unspeakable catastrophe waiting for us at the end of the line, it's hard to imagine we'd stop ourselves before we get there.
1853860	1856660	Perhaps that's the lesson of Pandora's Box.
1856860	1859660	Once it's open, there's no shutting it.
1859860	1863660	The changes we make to this world are permanent and irreversible.
1863660	1873460	Despite all of our progress, we are still very much at the mercy of nature, which exists to remind us that everything we have been given can just as easily be taken away.
1873660	1879460	If we are headed towards the end, may we stand in awe of its totality and finality.
1879660	1885460	Only then will we truly comprehend our inescapable reality as mortal creatures.
1885660	1892460	When contemplating the fragility of existence, I am often reminded of a passage I read from a modern day philosopher.
1892460	1899260	They present the image of a mouse whose curiosity has led to its demise, on which they comment the following.
1899460	1907260	One day, while doing nothing particularly out of the ordinary, because of natural laws he was completely powerless to understand or intuit,
1907460	1914260	he was instantly killed in a horrifying way by forces vastly in excess of anything he was ever designed to experience,
1914460	1918260	for no reason, to no one's particular surprise or upset.
1918460	1921260	In this, we are more like him than different.
1952460	1959260	Thank you for watching!
