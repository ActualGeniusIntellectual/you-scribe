0	24000	Seven, six, eight, nine, ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one, zero.
24000	34000	These are the stakes to make a world in which all of God's children can live or to go into the dark.
34000	40000	We must either love each other or we must die.
40000	46000	On July 16, 1945, humanity thrust itself into the nuclear age.
46000	52000	Five, four, three, two, one, zero.
52000	54000	All engines running.
54000	58000	Liftoff. We have a liftoff. 32 minutes past the hour.
58000	62000	Liftoff on Apollo 11.
62000	64000	We copy you down, Eagle.
64000	69000	Houston, Tranquility Base here. The Eagle has landed.
69000	73000	On July 20, 1969, man would walk on the moon.
73000	83000	Together, the technological innovations from nuclear fission and space exploration made it to form an unholy offspring, the intercontinental ballistic missile.
83000	92000	Glory be to the bomb and to the holy fallout as it was in the beginning is now and ever shall be world without end. Amen.
92000	97000	Amen. Amen.
97000	107000	Here's the plan. We get the warhead and we hold the world ransom for one million dollars.
107000	110000	Oh, oh, I'm going to blow up the Earth.
110000	112000	Oops!
116000	121000	The premise of nuclear annihilation is frequently thrown around as a trope in popular media.
122000	139000	It's terrifying. Most people are unable to confront the idea of their own mortality, let alone the mortality of human society as we know it.
139000	145000	Fortunately for us, nuclear warfare has remained within the realm of fiction since 1945.
145000	151000	Over the course of human history, atomic weapons have only been used in combat on two occasions.
151000	161000	You blow it up! Oh, damn you! God damn you all to hell!
169000	178000	On August 6, 1945, 12 American servicemen boarded the Enola Gay to detonate an atomic bomb on the Japanese city of Hiroshima.
181000	196000	The immediate fireball was estimated at a temperature of 10,000 degrees Fahrenheit, equivalent to the surface of the sun.
196000	203000	The bomb produced peak wind speeds of 980 miles per hour, three times faster than the strongest tornado ever recorded.
203000	208000	In an instant, more than 60,000 Japanese were dead.
209000	215000	Those who survived the blast were unsure whether they had. Many thought they had died and gone to hell.
215000	225000	A short time ago, an American airplane dropped one bomb on Hiroshima and destroyed its usefulness to the enemy.
225000	237000	With this bomb, we have now added a new and revolutionary increase in destruction to supplement the growing power of our armed forces.
237000	243000	It is an atomic bomb. It is a harnessing of the basic power of the universe.
243000	251000	The force from which the sun draws its power has been loosed against those who brought war to the Far East.
255000	262000	Those fortunate enough to avoid the blast were subsequently exposed to high levels of ionizing radiation from the nuclear fallout.
262000	267000	In the following months, thousands more would die from radiation exposure.
267000	275000	In total, the atomic bombing of Hiroshima is estimated to have killed between 90,000 and 146,000 people.
277000	285000	We have used it in order to shorten the agony of war, in order to save the lives of thousands and thousands of young Americans.
286000	292000	We shall continue to use it until we completely destroy Japan's power to make war.
293000	297000	Three days later, the United States would drop a second bomb on Nagasaki.
297000	313000	During the Second World War, Japanese military procedures were heavily based on the Bushido Code,
313000	318000	a traditional Japanese tenet which focused on the ideal of the honorable death.
318000	326000	Two of the most infamous tactics used by the Japanese military were the merciless war crimes committed against POWs and the kamikaze.
326000	333000	Both of these methods stemmed from Bushido, which dictated no greater honor than to die for the Emperor,
333000	336000	and no greater humiliation than to surrender to your enemy.
336000	343000	For generations, every soldier in the Japanese army was trained under the belief that if you surrendered to your enemy,
343000	349000	you forfeited all of your honor, and you no longer deserved basic human dignity.
349000	356000	The Japanese feared surrender more than death itself, and they would sooner commit suicide than submit to their foes in combat.
356000	365000	The thoughts and hopes of all America, indeed of all the civilized world, are centered tonight on the battleship Missouri.
366000	376000	There, on that small piece of American soil, anchored in Tokyo Harbor, the Japanese have just officially laid down their arms.
377000	381000	They have signed terms of unconditional surrender.
389000	396000	Sociologists estimate that in 1950, 83% of the world population identified with some sort of religion.
396000	399000	That's more than 2 billion God-fearing people.
399000	403000	Do you think any of them stopped to wonder whether we had become the gods?
403000	411000	We have spent more than 2 billion dollars on the greatest scientific gamble in history, and we have won.
412000	423000	But the greatest marvel is not the size of the enterprise, its secrecy, or its cost, but the achievement of scientific brains in making it work.
423000	426000	We knew the world would not be the same.
428000	437000	A few people laughed, a few people cried, most people were silent.
439000	445000	I remembered the line from the Hindu scripture, the Bhagavad Gita,
446000	450000	Now I am become death, the destroyer of worlds.
453000	462000	By the end of the Second World War, humanity had constructed a total of three nuclear weapons.
462000	472000	Just two of them were responsible for around 200,000 fatalities, the spiritual death of a nation, and the swift end of the deadliest conflict in human history.
472000	478000	By 1983, the global stockpile of nuclear weapons had increased to more than 55,000.
479000	484000	And for a brief moment, one man had to decide whether or not to blow up the world.
491000	495000	We interrupt our programming. This is a national emergency.
495000	500000	The following message is transmitted at the request of the United States government.
500000	505000	This is not a test. A nuclear attack is occurring against the United States.
505000	513000	Four nuclear missiles have been launched from unknown locations and are expected to strike the United States within the next 15 minutes.
513000	521000	Due to the uncertain tracks of these missiles, all residents of the United States should seek out and prepare to take shelter immediately.
523000	527000	Stand by for a message from the President of the United States.
528000	538000	So in your discussions of the nuclear freeze proposals, I urge you to beware the temptation of pride, the temptation of blindly declaring yourselves above it all,
538000	544000	and label both sides equally at fault, to ignore the facts of history and the aggressive impulses of an evil empire,
544000	553000	to simply call the arms race a giant misunderstanding, and thereby remove yourself from the struggle between right and wrong and good and evil.
558000	568000	The story of Lieutenant Colonel Stanislav Petrov is the story of a man so unremarkable that I'm only just now mentioning him eight minutes into this video about him.
568000	576000	Out of the estimated four million active Soviet military personnel in 1983, Stan Petrov was certainly one of them.
576000	582000	Just as he remained a near total stranger to the rest of the world throughout his life, this video will barely mention him.
582000	591000	The story of Stan Petrov is more of a story about the world surrounding Stan Petrov, a story of forces far bigger than him, far bigger than all of us.
591000	594000	So you'll have to forgive me that this video doesn't feature much of him.
594000	603000	But when it does, you're going to be glad he's there, because Stan's whole existence boiled down to resolving a generation's worth of mistakes before him.
603000	606000	How did he get here? How did we get here?
612000	613000	We made it clear!
620000	628000	Mankind's utilization of uranium and its compounds dates back to the first century, when it was used simply for aesthetic purposes.
628000	639000	1800 years later, French physicist Henri Becquerel mistakenly left a uranium sample on top of a photographic plate, returning to find the plate physically altered by the element.
639000	644000	By complete accident, Becquerel had just discovered the chemical property of radioactivity.
644000	657000	Over the following decades, researchers would discover that heavy elements like uranium and plutonium had unstable nuclei that would decay over time, releasing energy in the form of powerful ionizing radiation.
657000	662000	In due time, these discoveries would be exploited, harnessed, and weaponized.
662000	668000	You want the game to push you to your absolute limit and force you to experiment and find out what works.
668000	673000	And what sucks is when you find out what actually works just isn't that fun.
673000	683000	Variety and options are sucked out of the game, you have these severe difficulty spikes that feel overlooked by the developers, and what happens is the player starts pushing back.
683000	687000	And when you push the game to its limit, sometimes it cracks.
687000	705000	By the 1930s, Italian physicist Enrico Fermi began theorizing the process of nuclear fission, whereby splitting the nuclei of certain radioactive isotopes could trigger a chain reaction, releasing an extraordinary amount of energy.
705000	714000	By January 1939, Fermi helped conduct the first nuclear fission experiment, proving the concept to be scientifically feasible.
715000	720000	Eight months later, Germany invaded Poland, pitting the world at war.
727000	735000	When faced with the most threatening geopolitical foe in recent history, the Allied powers were eager to gather any advantage they could.
735000	746000	After the discovery of nuclear fission, nuclear researchers immediately postulated that the process could be refined and integrated into a weapon with a destructive capacity to obliterate an entire city.
746000	751000	A weapon so powerful that its target would have virtually no means of countering it.
751000	756000	As soon as nuclear fission was proven feasible, the stakes became clear to the world powers.
756000	767000	The first nation to develop an atomic bomb would seize tremendous dominion over global affairs, and no nation was more committed to developing nuclear weapons than the United States.
776000	781000	The city of Oak Ridge, Tennessee didn't officially exist until 1947.
781000	787000	The federal government kept the location a secret during the war to serve as a headquarters for the Manhattan Project,
787000	798000	an ambitious directive spanning 30 locations in the US, UK, and Canada with the sole intent of creating the world's first atomic bomb, and more importantly, doing so before the Germans.
798000	812000	Luckily for the Allies, the Nazis' irrational prejudice would spell doom for their nuclear program, as their leading Jewish physicists were forced to flee the country to escape religious persecution.
812000	823000	Due to their harsh discrimination, the Axis powers lost access to the scientific contributions of Enrico Fermi and another scientist by the name of Albert Einstein,
823000	829000	who initially persuaded President Franklin Roosevelt to pursue nuclear research before the Germans.
829000	839000	Together, the collaboration of 2 billion dollars, 130,000 employees, and some of the world's greatest scientific minds led to the bombs that ended World War II,
839000	843000	bombs that would fundamentally alter the nature of warfare.
843000	850000	The Rashimat and Nagasaki were smashed by two of these bombs, and Japan was driven to quick surrender.
850000	856000	For the future, the choice is peace or total destruction. The atomic age is here.
861000	867000	Although Albert Einstein heavily influenced the inception of the Manhattan Project, he never directly worked within it,
867000	876000	mostly because the US government feared he couldn't keep a secret, but also because of Einstein's philosophical objections to the mass production of nuclear weapons.
876000	883000	From very early on, Einstein anticipated the devastating effects that a nuclear war could unleash on human civilization.
883000	889000	When asked about the potential of a global conflict in the nuclear age, Einstein ominously responded,
890000	896000	I know not with what weapons World War III will be fought, but World War IV will be fought with sticks and stones.
906000	913000	Albert Einstein is considered one of, if not the smartest man to ever live, but people tended not to listen to him much.
913000	920000	Just like the process of a fission reaction, nuclear weapons were about to undergo an uncontrollable expansion.
943000	951000	By the end of World War II, the world's leaders were far more interested in other matters as an Iron Curtain had descended over Europe.
973000	1000000	In the American age, 55 seconds, but Mikalov has the puck, Mikalov sweeping in, out in front, backhander, goes wide, and they crate when they've got just a piece of it.
1000000	1008000	Hello fellow American pigs, this is your leader speaking, please carry on and continue to leave your information unsecure as you are fine.
1008000	1018000	Your nuclear secrets are safe and there is no need to increase security. Please do not purchase NordVPN as your information is in no way at risk.
1018000	1032000	Do not use Code M Fleming to save 75% off a 3 year plan. Instead spend your US dollar on tall fence around your big capitalist lawn so you may give privacy to neighbor who also is regular American citizen like you.
1032000	1041000	Very trustworthy, and certainly not trying to steal precious nuclear secrets from US government. You may now resume your regular capitalist activities.
1048000	1072000	The spoils of World War II were won by the victors, the United States and the Soviet Union. In the years prior, the US begrudgingly fought alongside the Soviets against a common enemy, partly due to President Roosevelt's surprisingly friendly relationship with Joseph Stalin.
1072000	1082000	In the spring of 1945, both FDR and Nazi Germany perished within the span of a month, and nothing was stopping hostilities from igniting between the US and USSR.
1082000	1095000	But just how hostile could they get? Well, shortly after the German surrender, the Allied powers proposed Operation Unthinkable, a plan to attack Russian forces to prevent their occupation of Eastern Europe.
1095000	1106000	Given the years of devastation on the European continent and the poor odds of success, the plan was never implemented, and the Soviets commandeered Eastern Europe virtually unopposed.
1106000	1119000	The wartime destruction of Europe's infrastructure left the US and Soviet Union as the most powerful countries in the world. Immediately, the seeds were sown for the next major global conflict, the Cold War.
1120000	1127000	The US and Russia are separated by about 5,000 miles, but they were separated even further in ideology.
1127000	1137000	The communist, authoritarian and secular values of the Soviet Union directly rivaled the capitalist, democratic and evangelical principles of the United States.
1137000	1143000	Their struggle for ideological supremacy would dictate global affairs for the next 50 years.
1144000	1151000	During this period, the United States feared communism so much that they were willing to oppose it no matter the moral expense.
1151000	1161000	Senator Joseph McCarthy infamously spearheaded the Red Scare, in which the US government violated civil liberties to interrogate citizens suspected of Russian espionage.
1161000	1171000	The space race saw up to 4% of the federal budget spent on NASA and the Apollo program, not out of scientific curiosity, but to put men on the moon before the Russians.
1171000	1184000	The rockets that eventually sent astronauts to the moon were constructed from the expertise of former Nazis, many of whom were rescued from prosecution over war crimes so that the US could develop better rockets than the Soviets.
1184000	1191000	One of the greatest scientific achievements in human history was built off the back of one of its greatest atrocities.
1192000	1199000	If Russia wins dominance of this completely new area, well, I think the consequences are fairly plain.
1199000	1202000	Probable Soviet world domination.
1202000	1209000	And although both Americans and Soviets considered each other their greatest threats, they would never directly declare war.
1209000	1219000	If they did, it probably would have met the end of the world, because by August 1949, the Soviet Union had successfully developed their own nuclear weapons.
1222000	1227000	The bombs would only grow in power and scale from here.
1235000	1242000	Prior to the nuclear age, the most powerful standard military explosive device was TNT.
1242000	1247000	One kilogram of TNT is enough to moderately damage a small building.
1248000	1252000	1,000 kilograms could shatter a city block.
1259000	1268000	500 tons of TNT will obliterate anything within a 200 meter radius and cause severe burns within 400 meters.
1268000	1280000	The largest man-made TNT explosion was the Halifax disaster, where a shipping collision led to the accidental detonation of 3 kilotons of TNT, killing more than 2,000 people.
1280000	1285000	In a populated area, the blast could have killed nearly 50,000.
1285000	1289000	The atomic bomb detonated over Hiroshima was five times more powerful.
1289000	1302000	Through the following decade, the fission process would be refined and explosions would only grow larger.
1302000	1310000	In 1954, the U.S. detonated Castle Bravo, producing an explosion equivalent to 15 megatons of TNT.
1310000	1317000	It was America's most powerful nuclear test, but it would pale in comparison to Tsar Bomba.
1317000	1320000	The most powerful bomb ever detonated.
1320000	1329000	In October 1961, the Soviet Union tested a three-stage hydrogen bomb that yielded a 50 megaton explosion.
1347000	1354000	I lay my vengeance and furious anger, those who attempt to poison and destroy my brothers.
1354000	1361000	And you will know my name is the Lord when I lay my vengeance upon thee.
1361000	1382000	The mushroom cloud reached an altitude of 65 kilometers, more than seven times the height of Mount Everest.
1382000	1385000	Why did the bombs get so big?
1385000	1392000	What's the matter, Colonel Sanders? Chicken?
1392000	1402000	In game theory, chicken refers to a game in which two drivers accelerate towards each other on a collision course, and whoever swerves is a chicken.
1402000	1406000	If neither driver swerves, they both suffer a deadly collision.
1406000	1412000	The potential risk of continuing straight is so severe that it should make swerving the only logical option.
1412000	1422000	But then again, if you assume your opponent is acting logically, then you can predict that they'll swerve, meaning that you should continue going straight to win the game.
1422000	1429000	This same dilemma is what underlined the nuclear arms race of the Cold War through the doctrine of brinkmanship.
1429000	1440000	Since nuclear weapons were such overpowered means of destruction, the only way to prevent a nuclear attack would be to have your own nuclear weapons as a form of deterrence.
1440000	1443000	If your enemy made more, then you had to make more.
1443000	1448000	If your enemy attached them to missiles, well then you better hire some rocket scientists.
1448000	1457000	Eventually, the global nuclear stockpile had grown to a scale where every major population center in the US and Russia was at risk of a nuclear strike.
1457000	1465000	This began the era of mutually assured destruction, where the only means of diplomacy was located at the edge of the apocalypse.
1465000	1476000	We got very close to going over the edge in October 1962 with the Cuban Missile Crisis, which up to that point was the nearest our nations ever came to nuclear intervention.
1486000	1492000	After nearly two weeks of tense negotiations, the two powers finally relented.
1492000	1497000	During this period, the threat of nuclear annihilation wasn't just a far-fetched fantasy.
1497000	1505000	It was part of day-to-day existence, so much so that American children had to practice nuclear drills in school.
1522000	1533000	Anticipating just how close they had come to total disaster, American and Soviet leaders decided to ease tensions for the next few years, and they entered a period of détente.
1533000	1547000	During this time, the US and Soviet Union entered a brief interval of diplomacy, signing a series of international treaties, including a ban on above-ground nuclear testing and an attempt to limit the volume of nuclear warheads.
1547000	1552000	For the first time ever, the US underwent a decrease in its nuclear stockpile.
1552000	1559000	Hostilities would eventually resume, as the sheer ideological differences between the two nations were too much to ignore.
1559000	1572000	The 1970s were a rough decade for the American public, who witnessed the failure of the Vietnam War, an economic recession, the Watergate scandal, and the resignation of the president, all in the span of just a few years.
1572000	1581000	Needless to say, the dedicated patriotism from the decades prior had quickly eroded into paranoia, and many Americans wanted a change.
1581000	1594000	Well, the time has come. You've seen the map. We've looked at the figures, and NBC News now makes its projection for the presidency. Reagan is our projected winner.
1594000	1602000	But I don't think anyone anticipated that it eventually would become a floodgate of one kind or another, where the votes would just flood in for Ronald Reagan.
1602000	1611000	In 1980, the US elected Ronald Reagan president, whose aggressive stance against Russia seemed like a welcome change from the last few administrations.
1611000	1616000	Once more, relations would run cold with the evil empire.
1616000	1637000	My fellow Americans, I'm coming before you tonight about the Korean Airline Massacre, the attack by the Soviet Union against 269 innocent men, women, and children aboard an unarmed Korean passenger plane.
1637000	1642000	This crime against humanity must never be forgotten, here or throughout the world.
1643000	1650000	By 1983, Soviet-American relations had deteriorated to near Cuban Missile Crisis levels.
1650000	1659000	In September, the Soviet Union shot down Korean Airlines Flight 007 after the passenger jet had mistakenly entered prohibited airspace.
1659000	1664000	All 269 people on board were killed, including US Congressman Larry McDonald.
1664000	1670000	Soviet leaders spent the following weeks anxiously anticipating retaliation from the US.
1670000	1678000	At the slightest indication of a nuclear launch, the Soviet Union was primed and ready to fire an immediate counterattack.
1678000	1681000	Good evening, I'm Ted Koppel and this is Nightline.
1681000	1686000	What will the US government do next in dealing with that Soviet attack on a Korean airliner?
1686000	1696000	On August 31st, the Soviet Union shot down an unarmed civilian jetliner murdering 269 innocent people, including Congressman Lawrence P. McDonald.
1697000	1706000	Yet some Congressmen still want to appease the Soviet Union by supporting a nuclear freeze that would make the Soviets more powerful and allow them to kill more innocent people.
1706000	1718000	What we are seeing today is in fact an evil empire that has demonstrated beyond a shadow of a doubt that since it doesn't mind killing 20 or 40 million of its own people, it certainly doesn't mind killing 269 innocent civilians.
1718000	1725000	Specifically, the question is, in your opinion, should the administration take strong action against the Soviets?
1725000	1730000	We ought to take swift, decisive actions to let the Soviets know they will never get away with this type of stunt again.
1730000	1734000	Now we'd like to take another look at our telephone poll, which is well underway.
1734000	1745000	And as you can see, the results are enormously lopsided in favor of those who believe that yes, the administration should take strong action against the Soviets.
1745000	1763000	On September 26th, just after midnight, the Soviet satellite warning system detected one missile, followed by four others, headed from the U.S. towards the Soviet Union.
1763000	1772000	Well, looks like this is it. After 200,000 years in development, the Great Human Experiment is about to come to an end.
1775000	1782000	There's a cosmological principle known as the Fermi Paradox.
1782000	1796000	The paradox stipulates that, considering the rapid development of civilization on Earth, and given the billions of stars in our galaxy and the overwhelming number of planets with the capacity to develop intelligent life, where is everybody?
1796000	1806000	The probability of other intelligent beings inhabiting our galaxy is almost certain in theory, and yet, our cosmic search for aliens continues to come up empty.
1806000	1812000	One unsettling solution to the Fermi Paradox is the theory of the Great Filter.
1812000	1818000	Maybe the reason we can't find any aliens is that intelligent beings are doomed to destroy themselves.
1818000	1829000	In an endless battle for resources, civilizations will inevitably develop weapons powerful enough to destroy themselves or their environment long before they develop interstellar travel.
1829000	1840000	Famed astronomer Carl Sagan speculated that if a civilization does not learn to control its destructive tendencies, it will likely perish within a century of developing advanced technology.
1840000	1845000	We must either love each other, or we must die.
1845000	1852000	On the morning of September 26, 1983, people around the world woke up to an ordinary Monday.
1852000	1857000	Children went to school, and adults went to work, just like they did every week.
1857000	1868000	Just hours earlier, somewhere in a military bunker near Moscow, Stan Petrov correctly determined that the nuclear warning was a false alarm, and no nukes were launched that day.
1868000	1875000	Petrov deduced that if the US were to launch a real nuclear strike, they wouldn't launch just five missiles.
1875000	1882000	While you may think that this would have given Petrov an easy decision, you have to consider the absurdity of the situation.
1882000	1890000	I think there's an argument to be made that, for a very brief moment, Stan Petrov was the most powerful person in human history.
1890000	1902000	Most people would say that they enjoy power, but what they probably mean is that they enjoy power in the presence of agency.
1902000	1911000	Most of us have very little power and agency. We do what we can to get by and have practically no means of influencing the world around us.
1911000	1917000	When most people think of power, they think of kings and CEOs and international celebrities.
1917000	1923000	The very exclusive members of our society who have both great power and great agency.
1923000	1928000	When people dream, most of them imagine themselves in this position.
1928000	1935000	On the other hand, some people would be willing to relinquish the stressful responsibilities of power and keep the agency.
1935000	1942000	You see this in the cultural icons of the nomadic hippie, or the western outlaw, or some dude who wins the Powerball jackpot.
1942000	1949000	They generally get to do what they want, but rather than influence the world around them, they're just sort of along for the ride.
1949000	1956000	Stan Petrov found himself in the least desirable position of all, great power and little agency.
1956000	1963000	For a few moments, he and he alone controlled the fates of the 55,000 nuclear weapons on Earth,
1963000	1968000	enough firepower to wipe out a majority of the world population in a matter of hours.
1968000	1972000	He didn't get to control how the weapons were used or where they were headed.
1972000	1976000	Petrov's only say in the matter was whether or not they were launched.
1976000	1982000	Had Petrov reported the warning as an attack, it's unlikely that anybody would have challenged it,
1982000	1985000	especially considering the Cold War tensions at the time.
1985000	1990000	You could say that at any given time, the president has the same amount of power,
1990000	1997000	but nuclear launch protocol is configured with a system of checks and balances to prevent the president from firing nukes on a whim.
1997000	2001000	The difference with Stan Petrov is that he was the protocol.
2001000	2009000	Petrov's decision of whether or not to report the warning directly influenced the outcome of whether or not nuclear weapons were fired that day.
2014000	2017000	We can all look back on this event and call it an easy decision.
2017000	2023000	I'm sure if given the choice, most of us wouldn't choose to kill a majority of the world population.
2024000	2028000	But Stan Petrov didn't have the luxury of historical hindsight.
2028000	2035000	In the moment, he had no way of knowing for sure that his intuition was correct and that the satellite warning system was wrong.
2035000	2040000	Wrong. Answer his neck. 300 volts.
2043000	2052000	In 1961, psychologist Stanley Milgram found that more than 60% of people could be persuaded to administer a lethal electric shock
2052000	2055000	as long as they were under the instruction of an authority figure.
2055000	2061000	And the way I see it, ladies, you owe me for one jelly donut!
2061000	2069000	Think about basic military training and how soldiers are conditioned to blindly follow authority and remain loyal to their nation at all costs.
2069000	2072000	Soldiers are not trained to operate as individuals.
2072000	2081000	They are trained to function as an interchangeable part of a larger system, and any deviation from their assigned purpose is often unacceptable.
2081000	2087000	Had Petrov only followed his training, he would have trusted the warning system and reported a nuclear strike.
2087000	2094000	Had the Soviet military protocol functioned as intended, the world as we know it would have ceased to exist.
2094000	2100000	Only by deliberately disobeying the system could Stan Petrov make the correct decision.
2100000	2105000	I want you to imagine yourself, or the average person, in this situation.
2105000	2113000	The system in front of you is telling you that your homeland and everyone you know and love are under attack from your fiercest geopolitical rival
2113000	2117000	when you know that tensions between your nations are near an all-time high.
2117000	2123000	You have no way of defending yourself from the attack, but you have the power to bring justice to the people responsible.
2123000	2128000	There's no time to think it over. You must decide and you must act immediately.
2128000	2136000	How many of us would push the red button? How many of us would deliberately violate our training on a gut feeling that everything is okay?
2136000	2141000	I'd like to think that September 26, 1983 was our judgment day,
2141000	2149000	when one unsuspecting man was tasked with making a single decision that represented the culmination of millions of bad decisions before him.
2149000	2156000	Let us be grateful that, despite all of our sins, Stanislav Petrov chose wisely and spared us.
2159000	2168000	A few years later, the global nuclear arsenal peaked at more than 70,000 warheads.
2168000	2173000	In 1985, Mikhail Gorbachev assumed leadership of the Soviet Union.
2173000	2180000	His cordial relationship with Ronald Reagan would allow the nations to open up a new era of diplomacy.
2189000	2194000	There has been a nuclear accident in the Soviet Union and the Soviets have admitted that it happened.
2194000	2201000	In 1986, the Chernobyl nuclear power plant in Pripyat, Ukraine suffered a catastrophic meltdown,
2201000	2205000	leading to the deaths of more than 4,000 people from radiation sickness.
2205000	2211000	It would be the first widely publicized event showcasing the disastrous health effects of ionizing radiation.
2211000	2215000	Overnight, public opinion of nuclear power took a nosedive,
2215000	2220000	and the world powers finally began taking steps towards denuclearization.
2220000	2225000	In the next decade, nearly half of the world's nuclear warheads were disarmed.
2225000	2230000	Mr. Gorbachev, tear down this wall.
2230000	2245000	Thousands and thousands of West Germans come to make the point that the wall has suddenly become irrelevant.
2245000	2251000	In 1991, the Soviet Union officially dissolved, bringing an end to the Cold War.
2251000	2256000	Ever since then, the US has been trying to find the next incarnation of the evil empire.
2256000	2261000	The Cold War forged an attitude of paranoid discontent that hasn't really gone away.
2261000	2265000	Lately, many of us have given up trying to find a formidable foreign foe,
2265000	2271000	and we've instead shifted our attention within our own borders and turned much of the paranoia on ourselves.
2271000	2279000	The existential horror of day to day life in the Cold War has largely receded to nothing more than a relic in fictional entertainment.
2279000	2284000	Like I said at the beginning of this video, most of us can't handle the idea of mortality,
2284000	2287000	so we tend to not think about it very much.
2290000	2295000	The panic was palpable. Hawaiians rushing for cover under the threat of a missile attack.
2295000	2300000	This child was lowered into a manhole. Another family huddled in a closet.
2300000	2304000	5,500 people called Honolulu's 911 system.
2304000	2307000	You are the person who triggered the false alert.
2307000	2320000	Yes. Unfortunately, I'm really not to blame in this. It was a system failure, and I did what I was trained to do.
2328000	2332000	Petrov retired from the Soviet military a year after this incident.
2332000	2336000	He lived a quiet, uneventful life for the rest of his days.
2336000	2341000	The false alarm remained a secret for more than a decade. Not even Petrov's wife knew about it.
2341000	2348000	Years later, when news of the event reached the press, he cooperated with media interviews and even an independent film,
2348000	2351000	but remained humble and modest regardless.
2351000	2357000	Stanislav Petrov died on May 19, 2017, to almost no publicity.
2357000	2360000	The press didn't even report on it until September.
2360000	2367000	Possibly the most important person of the 20th century was so obscure that it took months before anyone even noticed he was gone.
2367000	2372000	Chances are, most of you watching have probably never heard of him before this.
2372000	2378000	Billions of people are alive today because of his choice, and the vast majority of them will never know his name.
2378000	2385000	I think it's somewhat fitting that most people will never know about him, because in that aspect, he was just like the rest of us.
2385000	2390000	And if Stan Petrov had mercy for the world, then maybe the rest of us can too.
2390000	2395000	Life is fragile, and it can be taken away from us in an instant.
2395000	2398000	None of us know how much time we have left.
2398000	2404000	How much of it will we waste fighting endless wars that no one will even remember 50 years from now?
2404000	2408000	I think we're far better off spending that time enjoying what we share in common.
2409000	2411000	Will we ever achieve world peace?
2411000	2415000	Or are we doomed to fight like the savage creatures from which we came?
2415000	2419000	Perhaps enlightenment will allow us to overcome our prejudice.
2419000	2423000	Or maybe ignorance will lead us to our blissful salvation.
2423000	2430000	Only time will tell, but at the very least, we can be thankful that Stan Petrov gave us the opportunity to find out.
2430000	2434000	So sit back, relax, and crack open a can of Coke.
2434000	2439000	Because if we're lucky, there will never ever have to be another man like him.
2464000	2478000	And I'd like to buy the world a Coke
2478000	2481000	And keep it company
2481000	2484000	It's the real thing
2484000	2488000	What the world wants today
2488000	2491000	It's the real thing
2491000	2495000	What the world wants today
2495000	2498000	It's the real thing
