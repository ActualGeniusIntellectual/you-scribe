1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,840
How's your collection coming along?

2
00:00:01,840 --> 00:00:03,640
Well, I don't mean to brag, but it's pretty-

3
00:00:03,640 --> 00:00:04,520
Yay.

4
00:00:04,520 --> 00:00:07,760
On September 30th, 2010, Valve released an update

5
00:00:07,760 --> 00:00:11,720
to their flagship online multiplayer shooter Team Fortress 2.

6
00:00:11,720 --> 00:00:13,520
Nobody realized it at the time,

7
00:00:13,520 --> 00:00:15,800
but this update would go on to be so influential

8
00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:18,400
that it arguably transformed the core business model

9
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:21,200
of the gaming industry for the following decade.

10
00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:23,680
TF2's Manconomy update introduced

11
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:26,000
what was then a radical concept.

12
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,120
Players can now purchase cosmetic items

13
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:30,320
through in-game microtransactions,

14
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:33,080
but more importantly, they can now trade those items

15
00:00:33,080 --> 00:00:34,640
among themselves.

16
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:37,760
Almost overnight, the update ignited a robust free market

17
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:39,640
economy of virtual items,

18
00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:43,320
and no items were more valuable than unusual hats.

19
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:44,800
Valve would go on to make a fortune

20
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:47,240
off of TF2's new trading bonanza,

21
00:00:47,240 --> 00:00:49,200
an outcome that would ultimately convince them

22
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:52,320
to make the game free-to-play less than a year afterwards.

23
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:54,400
And despite the variety of items for sale

24
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:57,240
on TF2's storefront, the bulk of Valve's revenue

25
00:00:57,280 --> 00:00:59,840
would come instead from what you couldn't purchase.

26
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:01,560
Yo, yo, yo, break it down!

27
00:01:01,560 --> 00:01:03,840
Break it down for those crepes!

28
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:05,200
In the very same update,

29
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:08,560
Valve introduced the gaming industry's original loot crate,

30
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:11,280
an unlockable mystery box with a 1% chance

31
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:13,560
of granting the player an unusual hat,

32
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:15,600
items so comically ostentatious

33
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:17,320
that they would instantly catapult you

34
00:01:17,320 --> 00:01:20,480
to the center of attention on any server you joined.

35
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:24,240
Unusials were desired by all, but obtainable by few.

36
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:25,960
The only way to get your hands on one

37
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:28,080
was to spend hundreds of dollars unboxing

38
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:29,160
or to trade with someone

39
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:31,720
who spent hundreds of dollars unboxing.

40
00:01:31,720 --> 00:01:35,000
Naturally, this meant that unusual hats didn't come cheap.

41
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,040
The most coveted hats and particle effects

42
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:38,840
started to sell for thousands,

43
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:41,160
and eventually, one item ascended

44
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:43,640
to the holy grail of TF2 trading,

45
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:45,840
the Burning Flames Team Captain,

46
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:50,040
the only TF2 item to consistently sell for five figures.

47
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:51,720
Ever since this hat was added,

48
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:52,840
it has reigned supreme

49
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:55,920
as the single most desirable item in the game.

50
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:59,520
Out of the hundreds of millions of items in TF2's economy,

51
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:03,200
only 18 Burning Flames Team Captains exist.

52
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:05,640
If you happen to be in the market of obtaining one,

53
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:08,120
it's gonna cost you a pretty penny.

54
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:11,120
Most of you watching are probably recoiling in disgust

55
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:12,920
at how much someone would be willing to pay

56
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:14,040
for a virtual item

57
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:17,300
that you didn't even know existed 20 seconds ago.

58
00:02:17,300 --> 00:02:20,480
Why would somebody spend $16,000

59
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:22,800
on a bunch of worthless pixels?

60
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:26,080
Well, conceptually, unusual hats are nothing new.

61
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:27,480
It turns out that plenty of people

62
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:30,280
are willing to fork over a lot more than 16 grand

63
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:33,280
on items that the rest of us would consider worthless.

64
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:43,560
A few years after bringing the joy of crates to TF2,

65
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:46,200
Valve decided to double down on this business model

66
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:48,680
in their newest shooter, CSGO.

67
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:52,160
This game took TF2's economy and put it on steroids.

68
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:55,240
Compared to unusual hats' two degrees of variation,

69
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:57,920
CSGO weapon skins may differ in quality,

70
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:00,040
wear, kill trackers, and stickers,

71
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:03,120
which greatly influence the item's overall value.

72
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:05,120
Ideal versions of all these variables

73
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:07,480
can drive the prices of top CSGO items

74
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:09,220
into the six-figure mark.

75
00:03:09,220 --> 00:03:11,620
The most expensive item ever sold in the game

76
00:03:11,620 --> 00:03:14,420
incorporates an additional variable of rarity.

77
00:03:14,420 --> 00:03:16,840
The AK-47's case-hardened skin

78
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:19,400
is far from the most expensive on average.

79
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:23,120
However, pattern number 661 is prized by collectors

80
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:25,040
for its uniform blue top.

81
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:27,660
In addition to this one-in-a-thousand attribute,

82
00:03:27,660 --> 00:03:30,720
an AK-47 with minimal wear, a stat tracker,

83
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:32,880
and four holographic Titan stickers

84
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:36,520
sold for $150,000 earlier this year.

85
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:38,880
But the most valuable item in all of CSGO

86
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:41,980
is speculated to be another case-hardened weapon.

87
00:03:41,980 --> 00:03:45,400
The factory-new pattern 387 Blue Gem Karambit

88
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:48,560
was last sold to a collector in 2016.

89
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:52,500
Out of the nearly one billion items ever unboxed in CSGO,

90
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:56,100
the factory-new Blue Gem is the only one of its kind.

91
00:03:56,100 --> 00:03:58,360
Today, some traders appraise its value

92
00:03:58,360 --> 00:04:00,600
at three-quarters of a million dollars.

93
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:04,660
If you're not interested in dropping the value of a house

94
00:04:04,660 --> 00:04:07,080
on a bunch of pixels, then perhaps you'd rather

95
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:09,880
put that money towards a three-inch piece of paper.

96
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:11,960
Before the age of virtual cosmetics,

97
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:14,280
trading cards were the epitome of intrinsically

98
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:17,800
worthless items that could potentially cost a fortune.

99
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:19,920
Last year famously saw an explosion

100
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:22,040
in the Pokemon trading card market.

101
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:24,280
In December, a first edition shadowless

102
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:29,240
holographic Charizard card sold for a record $369,000,

103
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:32,980
one of only 122 copies in pristine condition.

104
00:04:32,980 --> 00:04:34,920
That record was broken three months later

105
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:38,000
in February of this year when a Pikachu Illustrator card

106
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,520
sold for $375,000.

107
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:42,960
The promotional card was only awarded to winners

108
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:46,280
of a 1998 Japanese art competition.

109
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:50,420
Of the estimated 24 billion Pokemon cards in circulation,

110
00:04:50,420 --> 00:04:54,320
only about 40 Pikachu Illustrators are known to exist.

111
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:57,500
Magic the Gathering predates the Pokemon trading card game

112
00:04:57,500 --> 00:05:00,400
by three years, giving collectors a bit more time

113
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:03,740
to salivate over the game's most exclusive finds.

114
00:05:03,740 --> 00:05:06,760
Magic's holy grail is the infamous Black Lotus,

115
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:09,960
the single rarest card of the game's original release.

116
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:12,260
Earlier this year, a signed Black Lotus

117
00:05:12,260 --> 00:05:14,320
from the game's Alpha set sold at auction

118
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:17,000
for more than $500,000.

119
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,300
While the market for Magic and Pokemon cards

120
00:05:19,300 --> 00:05:21,660
have had around 25 years to develop,

121
00:05:21,660 --> 00:05:24,160
sports trading cards have spent the past century

122
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:25,940
rising in value.

123
00:05:25,940 --> 00:05:29,220
In 1909, the American Tobacco Company was ready

124
00:05:29,220 --> 00:05:32,080
to release their T206 baseball card series,

125
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:35,000
which they distributed in packs of cigarettes.

126
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:38,400
However, prior to the sale, Pittsburgh Pirates shortstop

127
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:41,040
Onus Wagner revoked the rights to his likeness,

128
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:43,800
forcing the tobacco company to remove his cards

129
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:45,200
from circulation.

130
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:48,880
Due to the sudden retraction, as few as 50 Wagner cards

131
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:51,040
were ever distributed to the public.

132
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:54,760
By the 1930s, the T206 Wagner had already become

133
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:57,520
the most expensive baseball card in the world,

134
00:05:57,520 --> 00:06:02,240
selling in 1933 for the present-day equivalent of $1,000.

135
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:06,040
In 1991, one of three remaining mint-conditioned Wagners

136
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:08,400
was acquired by hockey-grade Wayne Gretzky

137
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:10,640
for nearly half a million dollars.

138
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:15,440
In 2016, another Min Wagner was sold for 3.1 million,

139
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:18,460
a record that stood until just last year.

140
00:06:18,460 --> 00:06:20,640
Currently, the most expensive baseball card

141
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:23,720
is a PSA Grade 9 Mickey Mantle rookie card,

142
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:27,180
which sold for 5.2 million this past January.

143
00:06:27,180 --> 00:06:29,480
However, after nearly a century of dominance

144
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:31,240
in the card-collecting market,

145
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:33,360
baseball cards look to soon be surpassed

146
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:35,600
by basketball cards in value.

147
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:38,880
In April of this year, a one of 23 autographed

148
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:43,280
LeBron James rookie card tied for the record of 5.2 million.

149
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:46,040
Dude, you are like a fry cook legend.

150
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:47,540
Will you sign my spatula?

151
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:50,980
Autographs provide collectors with a much more

152
00:06:50,980 --> 00:06:53,860
personal touch to their prized possessions.

153
00:06:53,860 --> 00:06:55,720
The value of autographs vary wildly

154
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:57,280
depending on its signee,

155
00:06:57,280 --> 00:07:00,040
but the most valuable ones typically belong to figures

156
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:02,660
who are no longer capable of producing them.

157
00:07:02,660 --> 00:07:05,840
In 2017, an autographed copy of Albert Einstein's

158
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:10,080
iconic tongue photo was sold for $125,000.

159
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:13,240
In 2018, a baseball featuring 11 signatures

160
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:15,760
from the sport's original Hall of Fame inductees

161
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:18,140
sold for more than $600,000.

162
00:07:18,140 --> 00:07:21,560
Some autographs can derive their value from the macabre.

163
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:24,600
On December 8, 1980, Mark David Chapman

164
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:26,600
would receive an autograph from John Lennon

165
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:29,000
moments before assassinating him.

166
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,520
30 years later, that autographed album

167
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:34,500
would sell for $850,000.

168
00:07:34,540 --> 00:07:37,180
However, by far the most expensive autographs

169
00:07:37,180 --> 00:07:38,980
are forged out of time.

170
00:07:38,980 --> 00:07:42,020
The signature of 16th century poet William Shakespeare

171
00:07:42,020 --> 00:07:45,500
has only been identified on six surviving documents.

172
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:48,060
Today, it's estimated that a Shakespeare autograph

173
00:07:48,060 --> 00:07:50,740
would sell for up to $5 million.

174
00:07:50,740 --> 00:07:52,800
The most expensive autograph ever sold

175
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:54,740
belongs to George Washington,

176
00:07:54,740 --> 00:07:56,860
whose personal copy of the Constitution

177
00:07:56,860 --> 00:08:00,340
was purchased for nearly 10 million in 2012.

178
00:08:00,340 --> 00:08:02,880
Autographs are a form of memorabilia.

179
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:06,040
Objects and souvenirs prized for their close association

180
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:08,340
with illustrious people and events.

181
00:08:08,340 --> 00:08:10,280
Sneakers have been one of the most popular

182
00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:12,020
forms of memorabilia to collect

183
00:08:12,020 --> 00:08:13,560
ever since the meteoric success

184
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:16,440
of Nike's Air Jordan brand in the 80s.

185
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:18,840
In 2020, an original pair of Jordans

186
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:23,040
worn by Michael Jordan himself sold for $560,000,

187
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:26,120
becoming the most expensive sneakers in the world.

188
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:29,020
Of course, the decades-long supremacy of the Air Jordans

189
00:08:29,020 --> 00:08:32,540
have recently been challenged by Kanye West's Yeezy brand,

190
00:08:32,540 --> 00:08:35,700
and in April of this year, an original pair of Yeezys

191
00:08:35,700 --> 00:08:40,420
worn by Kanye at the 2008 Grammy's sold for $1.8 million.

192
00:08:40,420 --> 00:08:43,220
Memorabilia from the most prestigious athletes and artists

193
00:08:43,220 --> 00:08:44,980
can fetch a hefty price,

194
00:08:44,980 --> 00:08:47,460
but by far the most expensive memorabilia

195
00:08:47,460 --> 00:08:49,980
belongs to the whimsical world of cinema.

196
00:08:49,980 --> 00:08:52,580
Darth Vader's helmet from the Empire Strikes Back

197
00:08:52,580 --> 00:08:56,260
sold for just under $900,000 in 2019.

198
00:08:56,260 --> 00:08:58,420
Marilyn Monroe's iconic white dress

199
00:08:58,420 --> 00:09:01,780
from the seven-year itch sold for $4.6 million,

200
00:09:01,780 --> 00:09:04,260
but the most expensive memorabilia ever worn

201
00:09:04,260 --> 00:09:07,100
by a movie star may be Dorothy's groovy slippers

202
00:09:07,100 --> 00:09:08,740
from The Wizard of Oz.

203
00:09:08,740 --> 00:09:11,700
The most recognizable symbol from the most beloved movie

204
00:09:11,700 --> 00:09:13,380
of the 20th century was listed

205
00:09:13,380 --> 00:09:16,380
at a price of $6 million in 2018.

206
00:09:16,380 --> 00:09:19,060
Although costumes may embody iconic characters

207
00:09:19,060 --> 00:09:21,740
more so than any other type of memorabilia,

208
00:09:21,740 --> 00:09:24,420
vehicles end up edging them out in price.

209
00:09:24,420 --> 00:09:27,780
James Bond's Aston Martin DB5 from Goldfinger

210
00:09:27,780 --> 00:09:29,820
sold for $6.4 million,

211
00:09:29,820 --> 00:09:33,060
possibly the most expensive piece of memorabilia ever sold

212
00:09:33,060 --> 00:09:35,580
was the General Lee from Dukes of Hazzard,

213
00:09:35,580 --> 00:09:38,340
selling for a whopping $9.9 million.

214
00:09:39,340 --> 00:09:41,140
When we come back, we'll take a look

215
00:09:41,140 --> 00:09:43,580
at what lies beyond the eight-figure mark.

216
00:09:44,700 --> 00:09:47,420
Well, I can't even fucking talk to me

217
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:49,740
and then look me in the eyes.

218
00:09:49,740 --> 00:09:51,700
And just a moment ago, here's what's happened.

219
00:09:51,700 --> 00:09:54,660
A fan somehow gets out of the infield area,

220
00:09:54,660 --> 00:09:55,540
comes out on the track,

221
00:09:55,540 --> 00:09:58,060
and is trying to get Pat Kidd's autograph.

222
00:10:00,580 --> 00:10:02,620
People ask me all the time,

223
00:10:02,620 --> 00:10:04,740
Emp, how can you afford all of these

224
00:10:04,740 --> 00:10:07,260
exceedingly rare and special items?

225
00:10:07,260 --> 00:10:10,660
Well, everyone, where I get my money isn't important.

226
00:10:10,660 --> 00:10:13,420
What is important is where that money doesn't go,

227
00:10:13,420 --> 00:10:17,340
paying some stupid bank a bunch of unnecessary fees.

228
00:10:17,340 --> 00:10:20,420
Current is looking to change the face of mobile banking,

229
00:10:20,420 --> 00:10:22,420

232
00:10:26,940 --> 00:10:28,740
and buy your own digital card.

233
00:10:28,740 --> 00:10:30,380
With Current, you can stop throwing away

234
00:10:30,380 --> 00:10:32,300
your hard-earned cash on hidden fees

235
00:10:32,300 --> 00:10:34,340
and put that money towards something useful,

236
00:10:34,340 --> 00:10:36,300
like expensive collectibles.

237
00:10:36,300 --> 00:10:39,300
The premium card comes with no minimum balance requirement

238
00:10:39,300 --> 00:10:42,220
and up to $100 in overdraft protection.

239

you could be on your way to owning

254
00:11:15,660 --> 00:11:20,380
that sweet 1969 Dodge Charger from Dukes of Hazzard.

255
00:11:20,380 --> 00:11:21,380
While the General Lee

256
00:11:21,380 --> 00:11:24,140
may be the most expensive piece of memorabilia,

257
00:11:24,140 --> 00:11:27,060
it's far from the most expensive automobile.

258
00:11:27,060 --> 00:11:29,300
Lamborghini is one of the most recognizable

259
00:11:29,300 --> 00:11:32,820
exotic car brands for average Joes to daydream about.

260
00:11:32,820 --> 00:11:34,500
A new Lamborghini Aventador

261
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:37,300
will set you back around $800,000

262
00:11:37,300 --> 00:11:40,980
with just over a thousand units being produced each year.

263
00:11:40,980 --> 00:11:42,900
That price is about 10 times less

264
00:11:42,900 --> 00:11:46,180
than Lamborghini's most expensive model, the Veneno,

265
00:11:46,180 --> 00:11:49,140
only 12 of which were ever sold to the public.

266
00:11:49,140 --> 00:11:51,700
However, for the most elite car collectors,

267
00:11:51,700 --> 00:11:55,180
a typical Lambo might as well be a Toyota Corolla.

268
00:11:55,180 --> 00:11:56,660
It's seven o'clock in the morning

269
00:11:56,660 --> 00:12:00,740
and Elon Musk anxiously waits for his golden payoff.

270
00:12:00,740 --> 00:12:03,780
I expect to receive a car that I've just bought,

271
00:12:03,780 --> 00:12:05,340
which is called McLaren F1.

272
00:12:06,660 --> 00:12:09,580
In the 1990s, the McLaren F1 set the record

273
00:12:09,580 --> 00:12:12,660
for the fastest top speed reached by a production car

274
00:12:12,660 --> 00:12:15,660
and has been prized by collectors ever since.

275
00:12:15,660 --> 00:12:17,340
Including special variants,

276
00:12:17,340 --> 00:12:21,140
only 71 McLaren F1s were ever sold to the public

277
00:12:21,140 --> 00:12:22,580
and recent sales of the model

278
00:12:22,580 --> 00:12:25,380
are now approaching the $20 million mark.

279
00:12:25,380 --> 00:12:27,340
The most expensive supercar right now

280
00:12:27,340 --> 00:12:30,540
is the ultra rare Pagani Zana HP Barchetta

281
00:12:30,540 --> 00:12:33,820
listed at a price of 23.5 million.

282
00:12:33,820 --> 00:12:36,300
However, the title of the most expensive automobile

283
00:12:36,300 --> 00:12:39,940
in the world belongs to fellow Italian automaker Ferrari.

284
00:12:39,940 --> 00:12:44,940
In 2018, a 1963 Ferrari 250 GTO sold for 70 million,

285
00:12:45,460 --> 00:12:48,060
truly showing that old money still reigns supreme

286
00:12:48,060 --> 00:12:49,940
in the automotive world.

287
00:12:49,940 --> 00:12:52,860
While car collectors have existed for over a century,

288
00:12:52,900 --> 00:12:55,580
stamp collectors date back even further.

289
00:12:55,580 --> 00:12:58,420
The first postage stamps were issued in the 1840s

290
00:12:58,420 --> 00:13:00,060
by the British government.

291
00:13:00,060 --> 00:13:04,500
In 1856, a shipment of stamps to British Guyana was delayed

292
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:07,260
forcing the postmaster to issue an emergency batch

293
00:13:07,260 --> 00:13:09,420
as a temporary replacement.

294
00:13:09,420 --> 00:13:11,580
The provisional stamps were then distributed

295
00:13:11,580 --> 00:13:14,660
and quietly forgotten until 17 years later

296
00:13:14,660 --> 00:13:16,700
when a young boy discovered the unusual

297
00:13:16,700 --> 00:13:20,500
one cent magenta octagon on one of his uncle's old letters.

298
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:22,780
The boy would end up selling the stamp to a collector

299
00:13:23,700 --> 00:13:24,540
for six shillings.

300
00:13:24,540 --> 00:13:27,060
That stamp would go on to become the only surviving copy

301
00:13:27,060 --> 00:13:29,740
of the British Guyana one cent magenta.

302
00:13:29,740 --> 00:13:32,460
Today, it is worth over $9 million

303
00:13:32,460 --> 00:13:35,420
and to the 60 million stamp collectors in the world,

304
00:13:35,420 --> 00:13:38,260
no other piece of postage is more valuable.

305
00:13:38,260 --> 00:13:41,540
If stamps are one of the oldest fixations for collectors,

306
00:13:41,540 --> 00:13:43,660
coins may be the oldest.

307
00:13:43,660 --> 00:13:46,060
Evidence of coin collecting dates as far back

308
00:13:46,060 --> 00:13:47,420
as ancient Rome.

309
00:13:47,420 --> 00:13:49,860
One of the most infamous events in Roman history

310
00:13:49,860 --> 00:13:52,500
was the assassination of Julius Caesar.

311
00:13:53,180 --> 00:13:54,660
Two years after usurping the throne,

312
00:13:54,660 --> 00:13:57,700
Brutus had several coins minted to commemorate himself

313
00:13:57,700 --> 00:13:59,940
literally getting away with murder.

314
00:13:59,940 --> 00:14:04,460
In 2020, 2,062 years after its creation,

315
00:14:04,460 --> 00:14:08,100
Brutus's gold coins sold for over $4 million.

316
00:14:08,100 --> 00:14:09,980
The most expensive coin ever sold

317
00:14:09,980 --> 00:14:12,060
happens to be another gold coin,

318
00:14:12,060 --> 00:14:15,460
the last gold coin ever minted by the US Treasury.

319
00:14:15,460 --> 00:14:19,100
In 1934, President Roosevelt issued an executive order

320
00:14:19,100 --> 00:14:22,340
outlawing gold coins from general circulation.

321
00:14:23,180 --> 00:14:25,700
The Treasury was ordered to destroy all 450,000

322
00:14:25,700 --> 00:14:28,740
newly minted 1933 double eagles.

323
00:14:28,740 --> 00:14:31,140
However, a few dozen were illegally rescued

324
00:14:31,140 --> 00:14:33,140
and distributed to collectors.

325
00:14:33,140 --> 00:14:34,740
Over the next several years,

326
00:14:34,740 --> 00:14:37,220
the federal government located, confiscated,

327
00:14:37,220 --> 00:14:40,100
and destroyed almost all of the remaining copies.

328
00:14:40,100 --> 00:14:43,740
Only one double eagle acquired by King Farouk of Egypt

329
00:14:43,740 --> 00:14:45,900
managed to evade apprehension.

330
00:14:45,900 --> 00:14:47,940
Today, that lone coin survives

331
00:14:47,940 --> 00:14:51,700
as the only 1933 double eagle in private possession.

332
00:14:51,700 --> 00:14:53,060
In June of this year,

333
00:14:53,060 --> 00:14:56,460
the coin was sold for nearly $19 million,

334
00:14:56,460 --> 00:15:00,020
more than 900,000 times its nominal value.

335
00:15:00,020 --> 00:15:01,500
See anything you like?

336
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:04,180
Yeah, I'll give you a buck 50 for this umbrella.

337
00:15:04,180 --> 00:15:06,100
A buck 50 for that?

338
00:15:06,100 --> 00:15:07,420
But it's an antique.

339
00:15:07,420 --> 00:15:10,420
If you keep something in good condition for long enough,

340
00:15:10,420 --> 00:15:12,980
it will eventually be worth a fortune.

341
00:15:12,980 --> 00:15:15,460
Antiques provide a treasure trove of rarities

342
00:15:15,460 --> 00:15:17,500
and have accounted for some of the most expensive

343
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:19,420
collectibles ever sold.

344
00:15:19,420 --> 00:15:21,700
Action Comics No. 1 marked the beginning

345
00:15:21,700 --> 00:15:24,340
of the superhero genre in pop culture.

346
00:15:24,340 --> 00:15:27,860
After selling for just 10 cents apiece in 1938,

347
00:15:27,860 --> 00:15:30,380
a mint-conditioned copy of the original Superman

348
00:15:30,380 --> 00:15:33,140
is now worth more than $3 million.

349
00:15:33,140 --> 00:15:35,260
In the 17th and 18th century,

350
00:15:35,260 --> 00:15:37,740
the Stradivari family built string instruments,

351
00:15:37,740 --> 00:15:39,260
which became world-renowned

352
00:15:39,260 --> 00:15:41,500
for their unmatched sound quality.

353
00:15:41,500 --> 00:15:45,940
In 2008, a Stradivarius cello sold for $20 million,

354
00:15:45,940 --> 00:15:49,820
becoming the most expensive musical instrument in the world.

355
00:15:49,820 --> 00:15:52,540
Leonardo da Vinci was the most recognizable figure

356
00:15:52,540 --> 00:15:55,060
of the 15th century, and he would end up writing

357
00:15:55,060 --> 00:15:57,380
what would eventually become the most expensive book

358
00:15:57,380 --> 00:15:58,540
in the world.

359
00:15:58,540 --> 00:16:01,780
In 1994, Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates

360
00:16:01,780 --> 00:16:03,940
purchased Leonardo's Codex Leister

361
00:16:03,940 --> 00:16:05,420
for more than $30 million.

362
00:16:06,300 --> 00:16:09,060
Unofficially, the most expensive antique ever sold

363
00:16:09,060 --> 00:16:11,820
was this 18th-century Qing Dynasty vase,

364
00:16:11,820 --> 00:16:14,220
selling at auction for over $80 million.

365
00:16:15,140 --> 00:16:17,420
It's at this point where the line between antique

366
00:16:17,420 --> 00:16:19,740
and artwork starts to blur.

367
00:16:19,740 --> 00:16:21,500
Approaching the nine-figure mark,

368
00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:23,780
we are beginning to enter the highest echelon

369
00:16:23,780 --> 00:16:26,340
of collectability, fine art.

370
00:16:26,340 --> 00:16:28,620
For centuries, expensive artwork has served

371
00:16:28,620 --> 00:16:31,540
as an enduring symbol of high-class society.

372
00:16:31,540 --> 00:16:33,660
For those who are so disgustingly wealthy

373
00:16:33,660 --> 00:16:35,420
that the concept of dollars and cents

374
00:16:35,420 --> 00:16:37,420
has practically lost all meaning,

375
00:16:37,420 --> 00:16:40,260
fine art has often acted as the final frontier

376
00:16:40,260 --> 00:16:42,140
of what money can buy.

377
00:16:42,420 --> 00:16:44,940
Currently, Alberto Giacometti's Pointing Man

378
00:16:44,940 --> 00:16:47,420
is the world's most expensive statue,

379
00:16:47,420 --> 00:16:50,780
selling to a collector for $141 million.

380
00:16:50,780 --> 00:16:52,940
If you consider jewelry to be art,

381
00:16:52,940 --> 00:16:55,740
then the prices become even more staggering.

382
00:16:55,740 --> 00:16:58,340
The infamous Hope Diamond necklace has been valued

383
00:16:58,340 --> 00:17:02,580
as high as $350 million and is generally considered

384
00:17:02,580 --> 00:17:05,540
to be the most expensive gem in the world.

385
00:17:05,540 --> 00:17:07,820
However, some sources claim that the title

386
00:17:07,820 --> 00:17:10,300
actually belongs to the Cullinan One,

387
00:17:10,300 --> 00:17:13,100
the largest colorless diamond ever cut.

388
00:17:13,100 --> 00:17:15,500
Part of the British royal family's scepter,

389
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:19,100
it has been valued as high as $400 million,

390
00:17:19,100 --> 00:17:20,460
but that's still not as much

391
00:17:20,460 --> 00:17:23,380
as the most expensive privately-owned painting,

392
00:17:23,380 --> 00:17:26,020
Leonardo da Vinci's Salvador Mundi.

393
00:17:26,020 --> 00:17:31,020
In 2017, it sold to a collector for $450 million

394
00:17:31,460 --> 00:17:34,660
and may quite possibly be the most expensive single item

395
00:17:34,660 --> 00:17:36,540
owned by any individual.

396
00:17:36,540 --> 00:17:39,060
Of course, the most expensive painting in the world

397
00:17:39,060 --> 00:17:42,660
is another Leonardo da Vinci work, the Mona Lisa,

398
00:17:42,660 --> 00:17:45,340
the most famous painting in human history,

399
00:17:45,340 --> 00:17:49,180
a work of art so valuable that it defies private ownership.

400
00:17:49,180 --> 00:17:51,180
The Mona Lisa is technically property

401
00:17:51,180 --> 00:17:52,500
of the nation of France

402
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:55,580
and resides on permanent display at the Louvre.

403
00:17:55,580 --> 00:17:59,500
It has an insured value of over $800 million,

404
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:02,380
equivalent to the GDP of Samoa.

405
00:18:02,380 --> 00:18:06,220
Beyond this point, we struggle to accurately appraise items.

406
00:18:06,220 --> 00:18:08,580
Anything more valuable starts to enter the realm

407
00:18:08,940 --> 00:18:10,220
of pricelessness.

408
00:18:10,220 --> 00:18:13,340
Certain items are deemed so anthropologically important

409
00:18:13,340 --> 00:18:16,460
that they transcend collectability and ownership.

410
00:18:16,460 --> 00:18:19,780
It's possible that ancient artifacts like the Rosetta Stone

411
00:18:19,780 --> 00:18:22,100
may be more valuable than the Mona Lisa,

412
00:18:22,100 --> 00:18:24,700
but we may never know if it really is.

413
00:18:24,700 --> 00:18:26,620
It's insightful to discover the point

414
00:18:26,620 --> 00:18:28,900
at which we stop pricing items.

415
00:18:28,900 --> 00:18:31,300
Based on what we know about how older objects

416
00:18:31,300 --> 00:18:34,900
continue to become significantly rarer and more expensive,

417
00:18:34,900 --> 00:18:38,100
then this 40,000-year-old flute made out of a mammoth tusk

418
00:18:38,100 --> 00:18:40,580
should intuitively be one of the most valuable items

419
00:18:40,580 --> 00:18:41,620
in the world.

420
00:18:41,620 --> 00:18:44,820
However, the mammoth flute has substantially less fanfare

421
00:18:44,820 --> 00:18:46,820
than a Stradivarius violin,

422
00:18:46,820 --> 00:18:49,620
despite the flute being 100 times older.

423
00:18:49,620 --> 00:18:52,100
This exception may reveal what exactly it is

424
00:18:52,100 --> 00:18:55,260
we find valuable about collecting rare items.

425
00:18:55,260 --> 00:18:56,260
Welcome to the Batcave.

426
00:18:56,260 --> 00:18:59,020
This is the Guinness World Record Batman collection.

427
00:18:59,020 --> 00:19:01,700
The act of collecting is far from rare.

428
00:19:01,700 --> 00:19:04,900
At least a third of Americans collect something.

429
00:19:04,940 --> 00:19:06,740
When I was a kid, I used to collect

430
00:19:06,740 --> 00:19:09,540
164-scale die-cast NASCARs,

431
00:19:09,540 --> 00:19:12,300
and I can truly say that it was one of the most satisfying

432
00:19:12,300 --> 00:19:15,540
and rewarding hobbies I've ever participated in.

433
00:19:15,540 --> 00:19:19,700
But why exactly do so many of us find collecting so rewarding?

434
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:23,220
The psychology of collecting is not very well understood,

435
00:19:23,220 --> 00:19:25,420
but our obsession with rarity may result

436
00:19:25,420 --> 00:19:26,900
from our brain's innate desire

437
00:19:26,900 --> 00:19:29,220
to seek out the extraordinary.

438
00:19:29,220 --> 00:19:31,180
The modern-day activity of collecting

439
00:19:31,180 --> 00:19:34,100
is largely a manifestation of foraging for food

440
00:19:34,100 --> 00:19:35,780
in prehistoric times.

441
00:19:35,780 --> 00:19:37,260
For our early ancestors,

442
00:19:37,260 --> 00:19:40,020
discovering novel and unique forms of sustenance

443
00:19:40,020 --> 00:19:42,020
meant a better chance at survival.

444
00:19:42,020 --> 00:19:44,740
Thus, our brains adapted to release dopamine

445
00:19:44,740 --> 00:19:48,420
whenever we are presented with new, extraordinary items.

446
00:19:48,420 --> 00:19:51,660
Obtaining food is no longer the satisfying challenge

447
00:19:51,660 --> 00:19:53,020
that it once was,

448
00:19:53,020 --> 00:19:55,220
and present-day collectors may be attempting

449
00:19:55,220 --> 00:19:57,100
to recreate the rush of discovering

450
00:19:57,100 --> 00:19:59,260
a new berry in the wilderness.

451
00:19:59,260 --> 00:20:02,580
The subconscious desire to recapture our foraging roots

452
00:20:02,620 --> 00:20:05,380
may be but a microcosm of a far greater desire

453
00:20:05,380 --> 00:20:07,660
to recapture our tribal roots.

454
00:20:07,660 --> 00:20:10,540
Today, we live in a very alienating society,

455
00:20:10,540 --> 00:20:12,980
a far cry from the tightly-knit clans

456
00:20:12,980 --> 00:20:15,180
which our ancestors occupied.

457
00:20:15,180 --> 00:20:17,780
When we spend 400 million on a painting,

458
00:20:17,780 --> 00:20:19,380
or nine million on a stamp,

459
00:20:19,380 --> 00:20:22,020
or 150,000 on a virtual gun,

460
00:20:22,020 --> 00:20:24,340
we are not just buying a rare item.

461
00:20:24,340 --> 00:20:27,020
In many ways, we are buying into the community

462
00:20:27,020 --> 00:20:29,580
that comes with owning a rare item.

463
00:20:29,580 --> 00:20:31,820
The act of foraging in prehistoric times

464
00:20:31,820 --> 00:20:35,580
was as much of a social event as it was a day-to-day task.

465
00:20:35,580 --> 00:20:38,300
It provided people with constant opportunities

466
00:20:38,300 --> 00:20:41,300
to demonstrate their usefulness towards their peers.

467
00:20:41,300 --> 00:20:43,660
Forging allowed people to feel valued

468
00:20:43,660 --> 00:20:45,700
by the community around them.

469
00:20:45,700 --> 00:20:47,980
We now live in an era where the average person

470
00:20:47,980 --> 00:20:50,540
has arguably never felt less valued.

471
00:20:50,540 --> 00:20:52,700
For many, joining a niche subculture

472
00:20:52,700 --> 00:20:54,700
is their only way to rekindle feelings

473
00:20:54,700 --> 00:20:56,420
of esteem and belonging.

474
00:20:56,420 --> 00:20:59,780
For collectors, it's a matter of finding a unified culture,

475
00:20:59,780 --> 00:21:03,620
one which truly represents their ideals and motivations.

476
00:21:03,620 --> 00:21:06,900
This may help justify why a 400-year-old violin

477
00:21:06,900 --> 00:21:10,820
is so much more desirable than a 40,000-year-old flute.

478
00:21:10,820 --> 00:21:12,660
When an item becomes too old,

479
00:21:12,660 --> 00:21:14,540
it loses the cultural relevance

480
00:21:14,540 --> 00:21:16,860
that makes it so compelling to us.

481
00:21:16,860 --> 00:21:19,260
People don't necessarily pay nine figures

482
00:21:19,260 --> 00:21:20,580
on an original da Vinci

483
00:21:20,580 --> 00:21:23,940
because it's centuries old or aesthetically pleasing.

484
00:21:23,940 --> 00:21:25,500
What they are truly paying for

485
00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:28,140
is a slice of what da Vinci represents.

486
00:21:28,140 --> 00:21:30,780
They want to attach themselves to the prestige

487
00:21:30,780 --> 00:21:33,580
that Leonardo da Vinci's name carries.

488
00:21:33,580 --> 00:21:37,020
People admire da Vinci, Michael Jordan, Superman.

489
00:21:37,020 --> 00:21:39,740
Maybe if we own an iconic piece of them,

490
00:21:39,740 --> 00:21:42,060
we can be admired too.

491
00:21:42,060 --> 00:21:43,580
While the impulse to collect

492
00:21:43,580 --> 00:21:46,340
once helped us gather survival resources,

493
00:21:46,340 --> 00:21:49,540
today it may be helping us gather social resources,

494
00:21:49,540 --> 00:21:51,740
which many are now finding more scarce

495
00:21:51,740 --> 00:21:53,820
than food, water, and shelter.

496
00:21:53,820 --> 00:21:56,500
For some, collecting rarities is the first step

497
00:21:56,500 --> 00:21:58,060
in connecting with others,

498
00:21:58,060 --> 00:22:00,860
and engaging with an exclusive culture.

499
00:22:00,860 --> 00:22:03,580
The rest of us may consider it a waste of money,

500
00:22:03,580 --> 00:22:05,180
but for certain collectors,

501
00:22:05,180 --> 00:22:08,660
belonging to something meaningful is worth every penny.

502
00:22:08,660 --> 00:22:10,140
In addition to belonging,

503
00:22:10,140 --> 00:22:13,140
collecting may be attempting to account for another aspect

504
00:22:13,140 --> 00:22:17,500
many find sorely lacking from modern society, autonomy.

505
00:22:17,500 --> 00:22:18,740
With each passing year,

506
00:22:18,740 --> 00:22:20,820
the world around us gets more complex,

507
00:22:20,820 --> 00:22:23,380
more chaotic, and more unpredictable.

508
00:22:23,380 --> 00:22:24,700
You can't go a few moments

509
00:22:24,700 --> 00:22:26,340
without discovering some new threat

510
00:22:26,340 --> 00:22:29,740
that you didn't even realize it was possible to worry about.

511
00:22:29,740 --> 00:22:32,620
After a while, it all starts to become overwhelming,

512
00:22:32,620 --> 00:22:34,740
and most of us end up feeling more and more

513
00:22:34,740 --> 00:22:36,700
like riders on the storm.

514
00:22:36,700 --> 00:22:38,740
Collecting may be one of our most effective

515
00:22:38,740 --> 00:22:41,660
psychological mechanisms at reclaiming autonomy

516
00:22:41,660 --> 00:22:44,180
in the face of chaos and uncertainty.

517
00:22:44,180 --> 00:22:46,940
Cultivating order out of so many disparate objects

518
00:22:46,940 --> 00:22:50,060
can help anchor us to a more stable state of mind.

519
00:22:50,060 --> 00:22:53,860
In this sense, collecting may serve as a therapeutic activity

520
00:22:53,860 --> 00:22:56,700
especially for those who've experienced trauma.

521
00:22:56,700 --> 00:22:59,540
It's no wonder why the recent explosion in collecting

522
00:22:59,540 --> 00:23:02,020
occurred when most of us were in lockdown,

523
00:23:02,020 --> 00:23:06,420
a period when many had never felt more uncertain and isolated.

524
00:23:06,420 --> 00:23:08,900
No matter the reason we collect rare items,

525
00:23:08,900 --> 00:23:12,260
it's clear that many of us are far better off because of it.

526
00:23:12,260 --> 00:23:14,460
And if the past year has shown us anything,

527
00:23:14,460 --> 00:23:17,860
it's that collecting isn't going away anytime soon.

528
00:23:17,860 --> 00:23:20,140
In the time I've been working on this video,

529
00:23:20,140 --> 00:23:23,500
several of its records have already become outdated.

530
00:23:23,500 --> 00:23:26,740
The future of collecting is more exciting than ever before.

531
00:23:26,740 --> 00:23:30,140
Following the advent of cryptocurrency and digital assets,

532
00:23:30,140 --> 00:23:31,980
non-fungible tokens have spawned

533
00:23:31,980 --> 00:23:34,300
a whole new genre of collectibles.

534
00:23:34,300 --> 00:23:37,900
In June of 2017, Creative Studio Larva Labs

535
00:23:37,900 --> 00:23:41,380
released a limited supply of 10,000 unique crypto punks

536
00:23:41,380 --> 00:23:43,620
for free on the Ethereum network.

537
00:23:43,620 --> 00:23:45,900
Each punk was algorithmically generated

538
00:23:45,900 --> 00:23:47,940
to have one or more distinct features,

539
00:23:47,940 --> 00:23:50,900
with about 100 spawning with a special classification

540
00:23:50,900 --> 00:23:54,620
of zombie, ape, or the rarest of all, alien.

541
00:23:54,620 --> 00:23:58,300
In March of this year, one of the nine alien crypto punks

542
00:23:58,300 --> 00:24:00,980
sold for $7.6 million,

543
00:24:00,980 --> 00:24:04,580
becoming the most expensive NFT ever sold.

544
00:24:04,580 --> 00:24:06,940
One day later, digital artist Beeple

545
00:24:06,940 --> 00:24:10,140
would shatter that record with his composition Everydays,

546
00:24:10,140 --> 00:24:12,940
a collage of all 5,000 images that he published

547
00:24:12,940 --> 00:24:16,540
over a time span dating back to May 2007.

548
00:24:16,540 --> 00:24:21,140
The Everydays NFT was purchased for over $69 million,

549
00:24:21,140 --> 00:24:24,180
about 8% the value of the Mona Lisa,

550
00:24:24,180 --> 00:24:27,540
a hell of a price to pay for a bunch of worthless pixels.

551
00:24:46,540 --> 00:24:47,540
.
