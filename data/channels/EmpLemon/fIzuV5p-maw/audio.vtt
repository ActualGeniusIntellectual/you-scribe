WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:01.840
How's your collection coming along?

00:01.840 --> 00:03.640
Well, I don't mean to brag, but it's pretty-

00:03.640 --> 00:04.520
Yay.

00:04.520 --> 00:07.760
On September 30th, 2010, Valve released an update

00:07.760 --> 00:11.720
to their flagship online multiplayer shooter Team Fortress 2.

00:11.720 --> 00:13.520
Nobody realized it at the time,

00:13.520 --> 00:15.800
but this update would go on to be so influential

00:15.800 --> 00:18.400
that it arguably transformed the core business model

00:18.400 --> 00:21.200
of the gaming industry for the following decade.

00:21.200 --> 00:23.680
TF2's Manconomy update introduced

00:23.680 --> 00:26.000
what was then a radical concept.

00:26.000 --> 00:28.120
Players can now purchase cosmetic items

00:28.160 --> 00:30.320
through in-game microtransactions,

00:30.320 --> 00:33.080
but more importantly, they can now trade those items

00:33.080 --> 00:34.640
among themselves.

00:34.640 --> 00:37.760
Almost overnight, the update ignited a robust free market

00:37.760 --> 00:39.640
economy of virtual items,

00:39.640 --> 00:43.320
and no items were more valuable than unusual hats.

00:43.320 --> 00:44.800
Valve would go on to make a fortune

00:44.800 --> 00:47.240
off of TF2's new trading bonanza,

00:47.240 --> 00:49.200
an outcome that would ultimately convince them

00:49.200 --> 00:52.320
to make the game free-to-play less than a year afterwards.

00:52.320 --> 00:54.400
And despite the variety of items for sale

00:54.400 --> 00:57.240
on TF2's storefront, the bulk of Valve's revenue

00:57.280 --> 00:59.840
would come instead from what you couldn't purchase.

00:59.840 --> 01:01.560
Yo, yo, yo, break it down!

01:01.560 --> 01:03.840
Break it down for those crepes!

01:03.840 --> 01:05.200
In the very same update,

01:05.200 --> 01:08.560
Valve introduced the gaming industry's original loot crate,

01:08.560 --> 01:11.280
an unlockable mystery box with a 1% chance

01:11.280 --> 01:13.560
of granting the player an unusual hat,

01:13.560 --> 01:15.600
items so comically ostentatious

01:15.600 --> 01:17.320
that they would instantly catapult you

01:17.320 --> 01:20.480
to the center of attention on any server you joined.

01:20.480 --> 01:24.240
Unusials were desired by all, but obtainable by few.

01:24.240 --> 01:25.960
The only way to get your hands on one

01:25.960 --> 01:28.080
was to spend hundreds of dollars unboxing

01:28.080 --> 01:29.160
or to trade with someone

01:29.160 --> 01:31.720
who spent hundreds of dollars unboxing.

01:31.720 --> 01:35.000
Naturally, this meant that unusual hats didn't come cheap.

01:35.000 --> 01:37.040
The most coveted hats and particle effects

01:37.040 --> 01:38.840
started to sell for thousands,

01:38.840 --> 01:41.160
and eventually, one item ascended

01:41.160 --> 01:43.640
to the holy grail of TF2 trading,

01:43.640 --> 01:45.840
the Burning Flames Team Captain,

01:45.840 --> 01:50.040
the only TF2 item to consistently sell for five figures.

01:50.040 --> 01:51.720
Ever since this hat was added,

01:51.720 --> 01:52.840
it has reigned supreme

01:52.840 --> 01:55.920
as the single most desirable item in the game.

01:55.920 --> 01:59.520
Out of the hundreds of millions of items in TF2's economy,

01:59.520 --> 02:03.200
only 18 Burning Flames Team Captains exist.

02:03.200 --> 02:05.640
If you happen to be in the market of obtaining one,

02:05.640 --> 02:08.120
it's gonna cost you a pretty penny.

02:08.120 --> 02:11.120
Most of you watching are probably recoiling in disgust

02:11.120 --> 02:12.920
at how much someone would be willing to pay

02:12.920 --> 02:14.040
for a virtual item

02:14.040 --> 02:17.300
that you didn't even know existed 20 seconds ago.

02:17.300 --> 02:20.480
Why would somebody spend $16,000

02:20.480 --> 02:22.800
on a bunch of worthless pixels?

02:22.800 --> 02:26.080
Well, conceptually, unusual hats are nothing new.

02:26.080 --> 02:27.480
It turns out that plenty of people

02:27.480 --> 02:30.280
are willing to fork over a lot more than 16 grand

02:30.280 --> 02:33.280
on items that the rest of us would consider worthless.

02:40.280 --> 02:43.560
A few years after bringing the joy of crates to TF2,

02:43.560 --> 02:46.200
Valve decided to double down on this business model

02:46.200 --> 02:48.680
in their newest shooter, CSGO.

02:48.680 --> 02:52.160
This game took TF2's economy and put it on steroids.

02:52.200 --> 02:55.240
Compared to unusual hats' two degrees of variation,

02:55.240 --> 02:57.920
CSGO weapon skins may differ in quality,

02:57.920 --> 03:00.040
wear, kill trackers, and stickers,

03:00.040 --> 03:03.120
which greatly influence the item's overall value.

03:03.120 --> 03:05.120
Ideal versions of all these variables

03:05.120 --> 03:07.480
can drive the prices of top CSGO items

03:07.480 --> 03:09.220
into the six-figure mark.

03:09.220 --> 03:11.620
The most expensive item ever sold in the game

03:11.620 --> 03:14.420
incorporates an additional variable of rarity.

03:14.420 --> 03:16.840
The AK-47's case-hardened skin

03:16.840 --> 03:19.400
is far from the most expensive on average.

03:19.400 --> 03:23.120
However, pattern number 661 is prized by collectors

03:23.120 --> 03:25.040
for its uniform blue top.

03:25.040 --> 03:27.660
In addition to this one-in-a-thousand attribute,

03:27.660 --> 03:30.720
an AK-47 with minimal wear, a stat tracker,

03:30.720 --> 03:32.880
and four holographic Titan stickers

03:32.880 --> 03:36.520
sold for $150,000 earlier this year.

03:36.520 --> 03:38.880
But the most valuable item in all of CSGO

03:38.880 --> 03:41.980
is speculated to be another case-hardened weapon.

03:41.980 --> 03:45.400
The factory-new pattern 387 Blue Gem Karambit

03:45.400 --> 03:48.560
was last sold to a collector in 2016.

03:48.600 --> 03:52.500
Out of the nearly one billion items ever unboxed in CSGO,

03:52.500 --> 03:56.100
the factory-new Blue Gem is the only one of its kind.

03:56.100 --> 03:58.360
Today, some traders appraise its value

03:58.360 --> 04:00.600
at three-quarters of a million dollars.

04:02.080 --> 04:04.660
If you're not interested in dropping the value of a house

04:04.660 --> 04:07.080
on a bunch of pixels, then perhaps you'd rather

04:07.080 --> 04:09.880
put that money towards a three-inch piece of paper.

04:09.880 --> 04:11.960
Before the age of virtual cosmetics,

04:11.960 --> 04:14.280
trading cards were the epitome of intrinsically

04:14.280 --> 04:17.800
worthless items that could potentially cost a fortune.

04:17.840 --> 04:19.920
Last year famously saw an explosion

04:19.920 --> 04:22.040
in the Pokemon trading card market.

04:22.040 --> 04:24.280
In December, a first edition shadowless

04:24.280 --> 04:29.240
holographic Charizard card sold for a record $369,000,

04:29.240 --> 04:32.980
one of only 122 copies in pristine condition.

04:32.980 --> 04:34.920
That record was broken three months later

04:34.920 --> 04:38.000
in February of this year when a Pikachu Illustrator card

04:38.000 --> 04:40.520
sold for $375,000.

04:40.520 --> 04:42.960
The promotional card was only awarded to winners

04:42.960 --> 04:46.280
of a 1998 Japanese art competition.

04:46.280 --> 04:50.420
Of the estimated 24 billion Pokemon cards in circulation,

04:50.420 --> 04:54.320
only about 40 Pikachu Illustrators are known to exist.

04:54.320 --> 04:57.500
Magic the Gathering predates the Pokemon trading card game

04:57.500 --> 05:00.400
by three years, giving collectors a bit more time

05:00.400 --> 05:03.740
to salivate over the game's most exclusive finds.

05:03.740 --> 05:06.760
Magic's holy grail is the infamous Black Lotus,

05:06.760 --> 05:09.960
the single rarest card of the game's original release.

05:09.960 --> 05:12.260
Earlier this year, a signed Black Lotus

05:12.260 --> 05:14.320
from the game's Alpha set sold at auction

05:14.320 --> 05:17.000
for more than $500,000.

05:17.000 --> 05:19.300
While the market for Magic and Pokemon cards

05:19.300 --> 05:21.660
have had around 25 years to develop,

05:21.660 --> 05:24.160
sports trading cards have spent the past century

05:24.160 --> 05:25.940
rising in value.

05:25.940 --> 05:29.220
In 1909, the American Tobacco Company was ready

05:29.220 --> 05:32.080
to release their T206 baseball card series,

05:32.080 --> 05:35.000
which they distributed in packs of cigarettes.

05:35.000 --> 05:38.400
However, prior to the sale, Pittsburgh Pirates shortstop

05:38.400 --> 05:41.040
Onus Wagner revoked the rights to his likeness,

05:41.040 --> 05:43.800
forcing the tobacco company to remove his cards

05:43.800 --> 05:45.200
from circulation.

05:45.200 --> 05:48.880
Due to the sudden retraction, as few as 50 Wagner cards

05:48.880 --> 05:51.040
were ever distributed to the public.

05:51.040 --> 05:54.760
By the 1930s, the T206 Wagner had already become

05:54.760 --> 05:57.520
the most expensive baseball card in the world,

05:57.520 --> 06:02.240
selling in 1933 for the present-day equivalent of $1,000.

06:02.240 --> 06:06.040
In 1991, one of three remaining mint-conditioned Wagners

06:06.040 --> 06:08.400
was acquired by hockey-grade Wayne Gretzky

06:08.400 --> 06:10.640
for nearly half a million dollars.

06:10.680 --> 06:15.440
In 2016, another Min Wagner was sold for 3.1 million,

06:15.440 --> 06:18.460
a record that stood until just last year.

06:18.460 --> 06:20.640
Currently, the most expensive baseball card

06:20.640 --> 06:23.720
is a PSA Grade 9 Mickey Mantle rookie card,

06:23.720 --> 06:27.180
which sold for 5.2 million this past January.

06:27.180 --> 06:29.480
However, after nearly a century of dominance

06:29.480 --> 06:31.240
in the card-collecting market,

06:31.240 --> 06:33.360
baseball cards look to soon be surpassed

06:33.360 --> 06:35.600
by basketball cards in value.

06:35.600 --> 06:38.880
In April of this year, a one of 23 autographed

06:38.880 --> 06:43.280
LeBron James rookie card tied for the record of 5.2 million.

06:43.280 --> 06:46.040
Dude, you are like a fry cook legend.

06:46.040 --> 06:47.540
Will you sign my spatula?

06:48.600 --> 06:50.980
Autographs provide collectors with a much more

06:50.980 --> 06:53.860
personal touch to their prized possessions.

06:53.860 --> 06:55.720
The value of autographs vary wildly

06:55.720 --> 06:57.280
depending on its signee,

06:57.280 --> 07:00.040
but the most valuable ones typically belong to figures

07:00.040 --> 07:02.660
who are no longer capable of producing them.

07:02.660 --> 07:05.840
In 2017, an autographed copy of Albert Einstein's

07:05.840 --> 07:10.080
iconic tongue photo was sold for $125,000.

07:10.080 --> 07:13.240
In 2018, a baseball featuring 11 signatures

07:13.240 --> 07:15.760
from the sport's original Hall of Fame inductees

07:15.760 --> 07:18.140
sold for more than $600,000.

07:18.140 --> 07:21.560
Some autographs can derive their value from the macabre.

07:21.560 --> 07:24.600
On December 8, 1980, Mark David Chapman

07:24.600 --> 07:26.600
would receive an autograph from John Lennon

07:26.600 --> 07:29.000
moments before assassinating him.

07:29.000 --> 07:31.520
30 years later, that autographed album

07:31.520 --> 07:34.500
would sell for $850,000.

07:34.540 --> 07:37.180
However, by far the most expensive autographs

07:37.180 --> 07:38.980
are forged out of time.

07:38.980 --> 07:42.020
The signature of 16th century poet William Shakespeare

07:42.020 --> 07:45.500
has only been identified on six surviving documents.

07:45.500 --> 07:48.060
Today, it's estimated that a Shakespeare autograph

07:48.060 --> 07:50.740
would sell for up to $5 million.

07:50.740 --> 07:52.800
The most expensive autograph ever sold

07:52.800 --> 07:54.740
belongs to George Washington,

07:54.740 --> 07:56.860
whose personal copy of the Constitution

07:56.860 --> 08:00.340
was purchased for nearly 10 million in 2012.

08:00.340 --> 08:02.880
Autographs are a form of memorabilia.

08:02.880 --> 08:06.040
Objects and souvenirs prized for their close association

08:06.040 --> 08:08.340
with illustrious people and events.

08:08.340 --> 08:10.280
Sneakers have been one of the most popular

08:10.280 --> 08:12.020
forms of memorabilia to collect

08:12.020 --> 08:13.560
ever since the meteoric success

08:13.560 --> 08:16.440
of Nike's Air Jordan brand in the 80s.

08:16.440 --> 08:18.840
In 2020, an original pair of Jordans

08:18.840 --> 08:23.040
worn by Michael Jordan himself sold for $560,000,

08:23.040 --> 08:26.120
becoming the most expensive sneakers in the world.

08:26.120 --> 08:29.020
Of course, the decades-long supremacy of the Air Jordans

08:29.020 --> 08:32.540
have recently been challenged by Kanye West's Yeezy brand,

08:32.540 --> 08:35.700
and in April of this year, an original pair of Yeezys

08:35.700 --> 08:40.420
worn by Kanye at the 2008 Grammy's sold for $1.8 million.

08:40.420 --> 08:43.220
Memorabilia from the most prestigious athletes and artists

08:43.220 --> 08:44.980
can fetch a hefty price,

08:44.980 --> 08:47.460
but by far the most expensive memorabilia

08:47.460 --> 08:49.980
belongs to the whimsical world of cinema.

08:49.980 --> 08:52.580
Darth Vader's helmet from the Empire Strikes Back

08:52.580 --> 08:56.260
sold for just under $900,000 in 2019.

08:56.260 --> 08:58.420
Marilyn Monroe's iconic white dress

08:58.420 --> 09:01.780
from the seven-year itch sold for $4.6 million,

09:01.780 --> 09:04.260
but the most expensive memorabilia ever worn

09:04.260 --> 09:07.100
by a movie star may be Dorothy's groovy slippers

09:07.100 --> 09:08.740
from The Wizard of Oz.

09:08.740 --> 09:11.700
The most recognizable symbol from the most beloved movie

09:11.700 --> 09:13.380
of the 20th century was listed

09:13.380 --> 09:16.380
at a price of $6 million in 2018.

09:16.380 --> 09:19.060
Although costumes may embody iconic characters

09:19.060 --> 09:21.740
more so than any other type of memorabilia,

09:21.740 --> 09:24.420
vehicles end up edging them out in price.

09:24.420 --> 09:27.780
James Bond's Aston Martin DB5 from Goldfinger

09:27.780 --> 09:29.820
sold for $6.4 million,

09:29.820 --> 09:33.060
possibly the most expensive piece of memorabilia ever sold

09:33.060 --> 09:35.580
was the General Lee from Dukes of Hazzard,

09:35.580 --> 09:38.340
selling for a whopping $9.9 million.

09:39.340 --> 09:41.140
When we come back, we'll take a look

09:41.140 --> 09:43.580
at what lies beyond the eight-figure mark.

09:44.700 --> 09:47.420
Well, I can't even fucking talk to me

09:47.420 --> 09:49.740
and then look me in the eyes.

09:49.740 --> 09:51.700
And just a moment ago, here's what's happened.

09:51.700 --> 09:54.660
A fan somehow gets out of the infield area,

09:54.660 --> 09:55.540
comes out on the track,

09:55.540 --> 09:58.060
and is trying to get Pat Kidd's autograph.

10:00.580 --> 10:02.620
People ask me all the time,

10:02.620 --> 10:04.740
Emp, how can you afford all of these

10:04.740 --> 10:07.260
exceedingly rare and special items?

10:07.260 --> 10:10.660
Well, everyone, where I get my money isn't important.

10:10.660 --> 10:13.420
What is important is where that money doesn't go,

10:13.420 --> 10:17.340
paying some stupid bank a bunch of unnecessary fees.

10:17.340 --> 10:20.420
Current is looking to change the face of mobile banking,

10:20.420 --> 10:22.420
and this card represents your ticket

10:22.420 --> 10:25.100
to accessing more of your money faster.

10:25.100 --> 10:26.940
With Current, you can stop trading

10:26.940 --> 10:28.740
and buy your own digital card.

10:28.740 --> 10:30.380
With Current, you can stop throwing away

10:30.380 --> 10:32.300
your hard-earned cash on hidden fees

11:15.660 --> 11:20.380
that sweet 1969 Dodge Charger from Dukes of Hazzard.

11:20.380 --> 11:21.380
While the General Lee

11:21.380 --> 11:24.140
may be the most expensive piece of memorabilia,

11:24.140 --> 11:27.060
it's far from the most expensive automobile.

11:27.060 --> 11:29.300
Lamborghini is one of the most recognizable

11:29.300 --> 11:32.820
exotic car brands for average Joes to daydream about.

11:32.820 --> 11:34.500
A new Lamborghini Aventador

11:34.500 --> 11:37.300
will set you back around $800,000

11:37.300 --> 11:40.980
with just over a thousand units being produced each year.

11:40.980 --> 11:42.900
That price is about 10 times less

11:42.900 --> 11:46.180
than Lamborghini's most expensive model, the Veneno,

11:46.180 --> 11:49.140
only 12 of which were ever sold to the public.

11:49.140 --> 11:51.700
However, for the most elite car collectors,

11:51.700 --> 11:55.180
a typical Lambo might as well be a Toyota Corolla.

11:55.180 --> 11:56.660
It's seven o'clock in the morning

11:56.660 --> 12:00.740
and Elon Musk anxiously waits for his golden payoff.

12:00.740 --> 12:03.780
I expect to receive a car that I've just bought,

12:03.780 --> 12:05.340
which is called McLaren F1.

12:06.660 --> 12:09.580
In the 1990s, the McLaren F1 set the record

12:09.580 --> 12:12.660
for the fastest top speed reached by a production car

12:12.660 --> 12:15.660
and has been prized by collectors ever since.

12:15.660 --> 12:17.340
Including special variants,

12:17.340 --> 12:21.140
only 71 McLaren F1s were ever sold to the public

12:21.140 --> 12:22.580
and recent sales of the model

12:22.580 --> 12:25.380
are now approaching the $20 million mark.

12:25.380 --> 12:27.340
The most expensive supercar right now

12:27.340 --> 12:30.540
is the ultra rare Pagani Zana HP Barchetta

12:30.540 --> 12:33.820
listed at a price of 23.5 million.

12:33.820 --> 12:36.300
However, the title of the most expensive automobile

12:36.300 --> 12:39.940
in the world belongs to fellow Italian automaker Ferrari.

12:39.940 --> 12:44.940
In 2018, a 1963 Ferrari 250 GTO sold for 70 million,

12:45.460 --> 12:48.060
truly showing that old money still reigns supreme

12:48.060 --> 12:49.940
in the automotive world.

12:49.940 --> 12:52.860
While car collectors have existed for over a century,

12:52.900 --> 12:55.580
stamp collectors date back even further.

12:55.580 --> 12:58.420
The first postage stamps were issued in the 1840s

12:58.420 --> 13:00.060
by the British government.

13:00.060 --> 13:04.500
In 1856, a shipment of stamps to British Guyana was delayed

13:04.500 --> 13:07.260
forcing the postmaster to issue an emergency batch

13:07.260 --> 13:09.420
as a temporary replacement.

13:09.420 --> 13:11.580
The provisional stamps were then distributed

13:11.580 --> 13:14.660
and quietly forgotten until 17 years later

13:14.660 --> 13:16.700
when a young boy discovered the unusual

13:16.700 --> 13:20.500
one cent magenta octagon on one of his uncle's old letters.

13:20.500 --> 13:22.780
The boy would end up selling the stamp to a collector

13:23.700 --> 13:24.540
for six shillings.

13:24.540 --> 13:27.060
That stamp would go on to become the only surviving copy

13:27.060 --> 13:29.740
of the British Guyana one cent magenta.

13:29.740 --> 13:32.460
Today, it is worth over $9 million

13:32.460 --> 13:35.420
and to the 60 million stamp collectors in the world,

13:35.420 --> 13:38.260
no other piece of postage is more valuable.

13:38.260 --> 13:41.540
If stamps are one of the oldest fixations for collectors,

13:41.540 --> 13:43.660
coins may be the oldest.

13:43.660 --> 13:46.060
Evidence of coin collecting dates as far back

13:46.060 --> 13:47.420
as ancient Rome.

13:47.420 --> 13:49.860
One of the most infamous events in Roman history

13:49.860 --> 13:52.500
was the assassination of Julius Caesar.

13:53.180 --> 13:54.660
Two years after usurping the throne,

13:54.660 --> 13:57.700
Brutus had several coins minted to commemorate himself

13:57.700 --> 13:59.940
literally getting away with murder.

13:59.940 --> 14:04.460
In 2020, 2,062 years after its creation,

14:04.460 --> 14:08.100
Brutus's gold coins sold for over $4 million.

14:08.100 --> 14:09.980
The most expensive coin ever sold

14:09.980 --> 14:12.060
happens to be another gold coin,

14:12.060 --> 14:15.460
the last gold coin ever minted by the US Treasury.

14:15.460 --> 14:19.100
In 1934, President Roosevelt issued an executive order

14:19.100 --> 14:22.340
outlawing gold coins from general circulation.

14:23.180 --> 14:25.700
The Treasury was ordered to destroy all 450,000

14:25.700 --> 14:28.740
newly minted 1933 double eagles.

14:28.740 --> 14:31.140
However, a few dozen were illegally rescued

14:31.140 --> 14:33.140
and distributed to collectors.

14:33.140 --> 14:34.740
Over the next several years,

14:34.740 --> 14:37.220
the federal government located, confiscated,

14:37.220 --> 14:40.100
and destroyed almost all of the remaining copies.

14:40.100 --> 14:43.740
Only one double eagle acquired by King Farouk of Egypt

14:43.740 --> 14:45.900
managed to evade apprehension.

14:45.900 --> 14:47.940
Today, that lone coin survives

14:47.940 --> 14:51.700
as the only 1933 double eagle in private possession.

14:51.700 --> 14:53.060
In June of this year,

14:53.060 --> 14:56.460
the coin was sold for nearly $19 million,

14:56.460 --> 15:00.020
more than 900,000 times its nominal value.

15:00.020 --> 15:01.500
See anything you like?

15:01.500 --> 15:04.180
Yeah, I'll give you a buck 50 for this umbrella.

15:04.180 --> 15:06.100
A buck 50 for that?

15:06.100 --> 15:07.420
But it's an antique.

15:07.420 --> 15:10.420
If you keep something in good condition for long enough,

15:10.420 --> 15:12.980
it will eventually be worth a fortune.

15:12.980 --> 15:15.460
Antiques provide a treasure trove of rarities

15:15.460 --> 15:17.500
and have accounted for some of the most expensive

15:17.500 --> 15:19.420
collectibles ever sold.

15:19.420 --> 15:21.700
Action Comics No. 1 marked the beginning

15:21.700 --> 15:24.340
of the superhero genre in pop culture.

15:24.340 --> 15:27.860
After selling for just 10 cents apiece in 1938,

15:27.860 --> 15:30.380
a mint-conditioned copy of the original Superman

15:30.380 --> 15:33.140
is now worth more than $3 million.

15:33.140 --> 15:35.260
In the 17th and 18th century,

15:35.260 --> 15:37.740
the Stradivari family built string instruments,

15:37.740 --> 15:39.260
which became world-renowned

15:39.260 --> 15:41.500
for their unmatched sound quality.

15:41.500 --> 15:45.940
In 2008, a Stradivarius cello sold for $20 million,

15:45.940 --> 15:49.820
becoming the most expensive musical instrument in the world.

15:49.820 --> 15:52.540
Leonardo da Vinci was the most recognizable figure

15:52.540 --> 15:55.060
of the 15th century, and he would end up writing

15:55.060 --> 15:57.380
what would eventually become the most expensive book

15:57.380 --> 15:58.540
in the world.

15:58.540 --> 16:01.780
In 1994, Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates

16:01.780 --> 16:03.940
purchased Leonardo's Codex Leister

16:03.940 --> 16:05.420
for more than $30 million.

16:06.300 --> 16:09.060
Unofficially, the most expensive antique ever sold

16:09.060 --> 16:11.820
was this 18th-century Qing Dynasty vase,

16:11.820 --> 16:14.220
selling at auction for over $80 million.

16:15.140 --> 16:17.420
It's at this point where the line between antique

16:17.420 --> 16:19.740
and artwork starts to blur.

16:19.740 --> 16:21.500
Approaching the nine-figure mark,

16:21.500 --> 16:23.780
we are beginning to enter the highest echelon

16:23.780 --> 16:26.340
of collectability, fine art.

16:26.340 --> 16:28.620
For centuries, expensive artwork has served

16:28.620 --> 16:31.540
as an enduring symbol of high-class society.

16:31.540 --> 16:33.660
For those who are so disgustingly wealthy

16:33.660 --> 16:35.420
that the concept of dollars and cents

16:35.420 --> 16:37.420
has practically lost all meaning,

16:37.420 --> 16:40.260
fine art has often acted as the final frontier

16:40.260 --> 16:42.140
of what money can buy.

16:42.420 --> 16:44.940
Currently, Alberto Giacometti's Pointing Man

16:44.940 --> 16:47.420
is the world's most expensive statue,

16:47.420 --> 16:50.780
selling to a collector for $141 million.

16:50.780 --> 16:52.940
If you consider jewelry to be art,

16:52.940 --> 16:55.740
then the prices become even more staggering.

16:55.740 --> 16:58.340
The infamous Hope Diamond necklace has been valued

16:58.340 --> 17:02.580
as high as $350 million and is generally considered

17:02.580 --> 17:05.540
to be the most expensive gem in the world.

17:05.540 --> 17:07.820
However, some sources claim that the title

17:07.820 --> 17:10.300
actually belongs to the Cullinan One,

17:10.300 --> 17:13.100
the largest colorless diamond ever cut.

17:13.100 --> 17:15.500
Part of the British royal family's scepter,

17:15.500 --> 17:19.100
it has been valued as high as $400 million,

17:19.100 --> 17:20.460
but that's still not as much

17:20.460 --> 17:23.380
as the most expensive privately-owned painting,

17:23.380 --> 17:26.020
Leonardo da Vinci's Salvador Mundi.

17:26.020 --> 17:31.020
In 2017, it sold to a collector for $450 million

17:31.460 --> 17:34.660
and may quite possibly be the most expensive single item

17:34.660 --> 17:36.540
owned by any individual.

17:36.540 --> 17:39.060
Of course, the most expensive painting in the world

17:39.060 --> 17:42.660
is another Leonardo da Vinci work, the Mona Lisa,

17:42.660 --> 17:45.340
the most famous painting in human history,

17:45.340 --> 17:49.180
a work of art so valuable that it defies private ownership.

17:49.180 --> 17:51.180
The Mona Lisa is technically property

17:51.180 --> 17:52.500
of the nation of France

17:52.500 --> 17:55.580
and resides on permanent display at the Louvre.

17:55.580 --> 17:59.500
It has an insured value of over $800 million,

17:59.500 --> 18:02.380
equivalent to the GDP of Samoa.

18:02.380 --> 18:06.220
Beyond this point, we struggle to accurately appraise items.

18:06.220 --> 18:08.580
Anything more valuable starts to enter the realm

18:08.940 --> 18:10.220
of pricelessness.

18:10.220 --> 18:13.340
Certain items are deemed so anthropologically important

18:13.340 --> 18:16.460
that they transcend collectability and ownership.

18:16.460 --> 18:19.780
It's possible that ancient artifacts like the Rosetta Stone

18:19.780 --> 18:22.100
may be more valuable than the Mona Lisa,

18:22.100 --> 18:24.700
but we may never know if it really is.

18:24.700 --> 18:26.620
It's insightful to discover the point

18:26.620 --> 18:28.900
at which we stop pricing items.

18:28.900 --> 18:31.300
Based on what we know about how older objects

18:31.300 --> 18:34.900
continue to become significantly rarer and more expensive,

18:34.900 --> 18:38.100
then this 40,000-year-old flute made out of a mammoth tusk

18:38.100 --> 18:40.580
should intuitively be one of the most valuable items

18:40.580 --> 18:41.620
in the world.

18:41.620 --> 18:44.820
However, the mammoth flute has substantially less fanfare

18:44.820 --> 18:46.820
than a Stradivarius violin,

18:46.820 --> 18:49.620
despite the flute being 100 times older.

18:49.620 --> 18:52.100
This exception may reveal what exactly it is

18:52.100 --> 18:55.260
we find valuable about collecting rare items.

18:55.260 --> 18:56.260
Welcome to the Batcave.

18:56.260 --> 18:59.020
This is the Guinness World Record Batman collection.

18:59.020 --> 19:01.700
The act of collecting is far from rare.

19:01.700 --> 19:04.900
At least a third of Americans collect something.

19:04.940 --> 19:06.740
When I was a kid, I used to collect

19:06.740 --> 19:09.540
164-scale die-cast NASCARs,

19:09.540 --> 19:12.300
and I can truly say that it was one of the most satisfying

19:12.300 --> 19:15.540
and rewarding hobbies I've ever participated in.

19:15.540 --> 19:19.700
But why exactly do so many of us find collecting so rewarding?

19:19.700 --> 19:23.220
The psychology of collecting is not very well understood,

19:23.220 --> 19:25.420
but our obsession with rarity may result

19:25.420 --> 19:26.900
from our brain's innate desire

19:26.900 --> 19:29.220
to seek out the extraordinary.

19:29.220 --> 19:31.180
The modern-day activity of collecting

19:31.180 --> 19:34.100
is largely a manifestation of foraging for food

19:34.100 --> 19:35.780
in prehistoric times.

19:35.780 --> 19:37.260
For our early ancestors,

19:37.260 --> 19:40.020
discovering novel and unique forms of sustenance

19:40.020 --> 19:42.020
meant a better chance at survival.

19:42.020 --> 19:44.740
Thus, our brains adapted to release dopamine

19:44.740 --> 19:48.420
whenever we are presented with new, extraordinary items.

19:48.420 --> 19:51.660
Obtaining food is no longer the satisfying challenge

19:51.660 --> 19:53.020
that it once was,

19:53.020 --> 19:55.220
and present-day collectors may be attempting

19:55.220 --> 19:57.100
to recreate the rush of discovering

19:57.100 --> 19:59.260
a new berry in the wilderness.

19:59.260 --> 20:02.580
The subconscious desire to recapture our foraging roots

20:02.620 --> 20:05.380
may be but a microcosm of a far greater desire

20:05.380 --> 20:07.660
to recapture our tribal roots.

20:07.660 --> 20:10.540
Today, we live in a very alienating society,

20:10.540 --> 20:12.980
a far cry from the tightly-knit clans

20:12.980 --> 20:15.180
which our ancestors occupied.

20:15.180 --> 20:17.780
When we spend 400 million on a painting,

20:17.780 --> 20:19.380
or nine million on a stamp,

20:19.380 --> 20:22.020
or 150,000 on a virtual gun,

20:22.020 --> 20:24.340
we are not just buying a rare item.

20:24.340 --> 20:27.020
In many ways, we are buying into the community

20:27.020 --> 20:29.580
that comes with owning a rare item.

20:29.580 --> 20:31.820
The act of foraging in prehistoric times

20:31.820 --> 20:35.580
was as much of a social event as it was a day-to-day task.

20:35.580 --> 20:38.300
It provided people with constant opportunities

20:38.300 --> 20:41.300
to demonstrate their usefulness towards their peers.

20:41.300 --> 20:43.660
Forging allowed people to feel valued

20:43.660 --> 20:45.700
by the community around them.

20:45.700 --> 20:47.980
We now live in an era where the average person

20:47.980 --> 20:50.540
has arguably never felt less valued.

20:50.540 --> 20:52.700
For many, joining a niche subculture

20:52.700 --> 20:54.700
is their only way to rekindle feelings

20:54.700 --> 20:56.420
of esteem and belonging.

20:56.420 --> 20:59.780
For collectors, it's a matter of finding a unified culture,

20:59.780 --> 21:03.620
one which truly represents their ideals and motivations.

21:03.620 --> 21:06.900
This may help justify why a 400-year-old violin

21:06.900 --> 21:10.820
is so much more desirable than a 40,000-year-old flute.

21:10.820 --> 21:12.660
When an item becomes too old,

21:12.660 --> 21:14.540
it loses the cultural relevance

21:14.540 --> 21:16.860
that makes it so compelling to us.

21:16.860 --> 21:19.260
People don't necessarily pay nine figures

21:19.260 --> 21:20.580
on an original da Vinci

21:20.580 --> 21:23.940
because it's centuries old or aesthetically pleasing.

21:23.940 --> 21:25.500
What they are truly paying for

21:25.500 --> 21:28.140
is a slice of what da Vinci represents.

21:28.140 --> 21:30.780
They want to attach themselves to the prestige

21:30.780 --> 21:33.580
that Leonardo da Vinci's name carries.

21:33.580 --> 21:37.020
People admire da Vinci, Michael Jordan, Superman.

21:37.020 --> 21:39.740
Maybe if we own an iconic piece of them,

21:39.740 --> 21:42.060
we can be admired too.

21:42.060 --> 21:43.580
While the impulse to collect

21:43.580 --> 21:46.340
once helped us gather survival resources,

21:46.340 --> 21:49.540
today it may be helping us gather social resources,

21:49.540 --> 21:51.740
which many are now finding more scarce

21:51.740 --> 21:53.820
than food, water, and shelter.

21:53.820 --> 21:56.500
For some, collecting rarities is the first step

21:56.500 --> 21:58.060
in connecting with others,

21:58.060 --> 22:00.860
and engaging with an exclusive culture.

22:00.860 --> 22:03.580
The rest of us may consider it a waste of money,

22:03.580 --> 22:05.180
but for certain collectors,

22:05.180 --> 22:08.660
belonging to something meaningful is worth every penny.

22:08.660 --> 22:10.140
In addition to belonging,

22:10.140 --> 22:13.140
collecting may be attempting to account for another aspect

22:13.140 --> 22:17.500
many find sorely lacking from modern society, autonomy.

22:17.500 --> 22:18.740
With each passing year,

22:18.740 --> 22:20.820
the world around us gets more complex,

22:20.820 --> 22:23.380
more chaotic, and more unpredictable.

22:23.380 --> 22:24.700
You can't go a few moments

22:24.700 --> 22:26.340
without discovering some new threat

22:26.340 --> 22:29.740
that you didn't even realize it was possible to worry about.

22:29.740 --> 22:32.620
After a while, it all starts to become overwhelming,

22:32.620 --> 22:34.740
and most of us end up feeling more and more

22:34.740 --> 22:36.700
like riders on the storm.

22:36.700 --> 22:38.740
Collecting may be one of our most effective

22:38.740 --> 22:41.660
psychological mechanisms at reclaiming autonomy

22:41.660 --> 22:44.180
in the face of chaos and uncertainty.

22:44.180 --> 22:46.940
Cultivating order out of so many disparate objects

22:46.940 --> 22:50.060
can help anchor us to a more stable state of mind.

22:50.060 --> 22:53.860
In this sense, collecting may serve as a therapeutic activity

22:53.860 --> 22:56.700
especially for those who've experienced trauma.

22:56.700 --> 22:59.540
It's no wonder why the recent explosion in collecting

22:59.540 --> 23:02.020
occurred when most of us were in lockdown,

23:02.020 --> 23:06.420
a period when many had never felt more uncertain and isolated.

23:06.420 --> 23:08.900
No matter the reason we collect rare items,

23:08.900 --> 23:12.260
it's clear that many of us are far better off because of it.

23:12.260 --> 23:14.460
And if the past year has shown us anything,

23:14.460 --> 23:17.860
it's that collecting isn't going away anytime soon.

23:17.860 --> 23:20.140
In the time I've been working on this video,

23:20.140 --> 23:23.500
several of its records have already become outdated.

23:23.500 --> 23:26.740
The future of collecting is more exciting than ever before.

23:26.740 --> 23:30.140
Following the advent of cryptocurrency and digital assets,

23:30.140 --> 23:31.980
non-fungible tokens have spawned

23:31.980 --> 23:34.300
a whole new genre of collectibles.

23:34.300 --> 23:37.900
In June of 2017, Creative Studio Larva Labs

23:37.900 --> 23:41.380
released a limited supply of 10,000 unique crypto punks

23:41.380 --> 23:43.620
for free on the Ethereum network.

23:43.620 --> 23:45.900
Each punk was algorithmically generated

23:45.900 --> 23:47.940
to have one or more distinct features,

23:47.940 --> 23:50.900
with about 100 spawning with a special classification

23:50.900 --> 23:54.620
of zombie, ape, or the rarest of all, alien.

23:54.620 --> 23:58.300
In March of this year, one of the nine alien crypto punks

23:58.300 --> 24:00.980
sold for $7.6 million,

24:00.980 --> 24:04.580
becoming the most expensive NFT ever sold.

24:04.580 --> 24:06.940
One day later, digital artist Beeple

24:06.940 --> 24:10.140
would shatter that record with his composition Everydays,

24:10.140 --> 24:12.940
a collage of all 5,000 images that he published

24:12.940 --> 24:16.540
over a time span dating back to May 2007.

24:16.540 --> 24:21.140
The Everydays NFT was purchased for over $69 million,

24:21.140 --> 24:24.180
about 8% the value of the Mona Lisa,

24:24.180 --> 24:27.540
a hell of a price to pay for a bunch of worthless pixels.

24:46.540 --> 24:47.540
.
