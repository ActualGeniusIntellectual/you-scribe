0	1840	How's your collection coming along?
1840	3640	Well, I don't mean to brag, but it's pretty-
3640	4520	Yay.
4520	7760	On September 30th, 2010, Valve released an update
7760	11720	to their flagship online multiplayer shooter Team Fortress 2.
11720	13520	Nobody realized it at the time,
13520	15800	but this update would go on to be so influential
15800	18400	that it arguably transformed the core business model
18400	21200	of the gaming industry for the following decade.
21200	23680	TF2's Manconomy update introduced
23680	26000	what was then a radical concept.
26000	28120	Players can now purchase cosmetic items
28160	30320	through in-game microtransactions,
30320	33080	but more importantly, they can now trade those items
33080	34640	among themselves.
34640	37760	Almost overnight, the update ignited a robust free market
37760	39640	economy of virtual items,
39640	43320	and no items were more valuable than unusual hats.
43320	44800	Valve would go on to make a fortune
44800	47240	off of TF2's new trading bonanza,
47240	49200	an outcome that would ultimately convince them
49200	52320	to make the game free-to-play less than a year afterwards.
52320	54400	And despite the variety of items for sale
54400	57240	on TF2's storefront, the bulk of Valve's revenue
57280	59840	would come instead from what you couldn't purchase.
59840	61560	Yo, yo, yo, break it down!
61560	63840	Break it down for those crepes!
63840	65200	In the very same update,
65200	68560	Valve introduced the gaming industry's original loot crate,
68560	71280	an unlockable mystery box with a 1% chance
71280	73560	of granting the player an unusual hat,
73560	75600	items so comically ostentatious
75600	77320	that they would instantly catapult you
77320	80480	to the center of attention on any server you joined.
80480	84240	Unusials were desired by all, but obtainable by few.
84240	85960	The only way to get your hands on one
85960	88080	was to spend hundreds of dollars unboxing
88080	89160	or to trade with someone
89160	91720	who spent hundreds of dollars unboxing.
91720	95000	Naturally, this meant that unusual hats didn't come cheap.
95000	97040	The most coveted hats and particle effects
97040	98840	started to sell for thousands,
98840	101160	and eventually, one item ascended
101160	103640	to the holy grail of TF2 trading,
103640	105840	the Burning Flames Team Captain,
105840	110040	the only TF2 item to consistently sell for five figures.
110040	111720	Ever since this hat was added,
111720	112840	it has reigned supreme
112840	115920	as the single most desirable item in the game.
115920	119520	Out of the hundreds of millions of items in TF2's economy,
119520	123200	only 18 Burning Flames Team Captains exist.
123200	125640	If you happen to be in the market of obtaining one,
125640	128120	it's gonna cost you a pretty penny.
128120	131120	Most of you watching are probably recoiling in disgust
131120	132920	at how much someone would be willing to pay
132920	134040	for a virtual item
134040	137300	that you didn't even know existed 20 seconds ago.
137300	140480	Why would somebody spend $16,000
140480	142800	on a bunch of worthless pixels?
142800	146080	Well, conceptually, unusual hats are nothing new.
146080	147480	It turns out that plenty of people
147480	150280	are willing to fork over a lot more than 16 grand
150280	153280	on items that the rest of us would consider worthless.
160280	163560	A few years after bringing the joy of crates to TF2,
163560	166200	Valve decided to double down on this business model
166200	168680	in their newest shooter, CSGO.
168680	172160	This game took TF2's economy and put it on steroids.
172200	175240	Compared to unusual hats' two degrees of variation,
175240	177920	CSGO weapon skins may differ in quality,
177920	180040	wear, kill trackers, and stickers,
180040	183120	which greatly influence the item's overall value.
183120	185120	Ideal versions of all these variables
185120	187480	can drive the prices of top CSGO items
187480	189220	into the six-figure mark.
189220	191620	The most expensive item ever sold in the game
191620	194420	incorporates an additional variable of rarity.
194420	196840	The AK-47's case-hardened skin
196840	199400	is far from the most expensive on average.
199400	203120	However, pattern number 661 is prized by collectors
203120	205040	for its uniform blue top.
205040	207660	In addition to this one-in-a-thousand attribute,
207660	210720	an AK-47 with minimal wear, a stat tracker,
210720	212880	and four holographic Titan stickers
212880	216520	sold for $150,000 earlier this year.
216520	218880	But the most valuable item in all of CSGO
218880	221980	is speculated to be another case-hardened weapon.
221980	225400	The factory-new pattern 387 Blue Gem Karambit
225400	228560	was last sold to a collector in 2016.
228600	232500	Out of the nearly one billion items ever unboxed in CSGO,
232500	236100	the factory-new Blue Gem is the only one of its kind.
236100	238360	Today, some traders appraise its value
238360	240600	at three-quarters of a million dollars.
242080	244660	If you're not interested in dropping the value of a house
244660	247080	on a bunch of pixels, then perhaps you'd rather
247080	249880	put that money towards a three-inch piece of paper.
249880	251960	Before the age of virtual cosmetics,
251960	254280	trading cards were the epitome of intrinsically
254280	257800	worthless items that could potentially cost a fortune.
257840	259920	Last year famously saw an explosion
259920	262040	in the Pokemon trading card market.
262040	264280	In December, a first edition shadowless
264280	269240	holographic Charizard card sold for a record $369,000,
269240	272980	one of only 122 copies in pristine condition.
272980	274920	That record was broken three months later
274920	278000	in February of this year when a Pikachu Illustrator card
278000	280520	sold for $375,000.
280520	282960	The promotional card was only awarded to winners
282960	286280	of a 1998 Japanese art competition.
286280	290420	Of the estimated 24 billion Pokemon cards in circulation,
290420	294320	only about 40 Pikachu Illustrators are known to exist.
294320	297500	Magic the Gathering predates the Pokemon trading card game
297500	300400	by three years, giving collectors a bit more time
300400	303740	to salivate over the game's most exclusive finds.
303740	306760	Magic's holy grail is the infamous Black Lotus,
306760	309960	the single rarest card of the game's original release.
309960	312260	Earlier this year, a signed Black Lotus
312260	314320	from the game's Alpha set sold at auction
314320	317000	for more than $500,000.
317000	319300	While the market for Magic and Pokemon cards
319300	321660	have had around 25 years to develop,
321660	324160	sports trading cards have spent the past century
324160	325940	rising in value.
325940	329220	In 1909, the American Tobacco Company was ready
329220	332080	to release their T206 baseball card series,
332080	335000	which they distributed in packs of cigarettes.
335000	338400	However, prior to the sale, Pittsburgh Pirates shortstop
338400	341040	Onus Wagner revoked the rights to his likeness,
341040	343800	forcing the tobacco company to remove his cards
343800	345200	from circulation.
345200	348880	Due to the sudden retraction, as few as 50 Wagner cards
348880	351040	were ever distributed to the public.
351040	354760	By the 1930s, the T206 Wagner had already become
354760	357520	the most expensive baseball card in the world,
357520	362240	selling in 1933 for the present-day equivalent of $1,000.
362240	366040	In 1991, one of three remaining mint-conditioned Wagners
366040	368400	was acquired by hockey-grade Wayne Gretzky
368400	370640	for nearly half a million dollars.
370680	375440	In 2016, another Min Wagner was sold for 3.1 million,
375440	378460	a record that stood until just last year.
378460	380640	Currently, the most expensive baseball card
380640	383720	is a PSA Grade 9 Mickey Mantle rookie card,
383720	387180	which sold for 5.2 million this past January.
387180	389480	However, after nearly a century of dominance
389480	391240	in the card-collecting market,
391240	393360	baseball cards look to soon be surpassed
393360	395600	by basketball cards in value.
395600	398880	In April of this year, a one of 23 autographed
398880	403280	LeBron James rookie card tied for the record of 5.2 million.
403280	406040	Dude, you are like a fry cook legend.
406040	407540	Will you sign my spatula?
408600	410980	Autographs provide collectors with a much more
410980	413860	personal touch to their prized possessions.
413860	415720	The value of autographs vary wildly
415720	417280	depending on its signee,
417280	420040	but the most valuable ones typically belong to figures
420040	422660	who are no longer capable of producing them.
422660	425840	In 2017, an autographed copy of Albert Einstein's
425840	430080	iconic tongue photo was sold for $125,000.
430080	433240	In 2018, a baseball featuring 11 signatures
433240	435760	from the sport's original Hall of Fame inductees
435760	438140	sold for more than $600,000.
438140	441560	Some autographs can derive their value from the macabre.
441560	444600	On December 8, 1980, Mark David Chapman
444600	446600	would receive an autograph from John Lennon
446600	449000	moments before assassinating him.
449000	451520	30 years later, that autographed album
451520	454500	would sell for $850,000.
454540	457180	However, by far the most expensive autographs
457180	458980	are forged out of time.
458980	462020	The signature of 16th century poet William Shakespeare
462020	465500	has only been identified on six surviving documents.
465500	468060	Today, it's estimated that a Shakespeare autograph
468060	470740	would sell for up to $5 million.
470740	472800	The most expensive autograph ever sold
472800	474740	belongs to George Washington,
474740	476860	whose personal copy of the Constitution
476860	480340	was purchased for nearly 10 million in 2012.
480340	482880	Autographs are a form of memorabilia.
482880	486040	Objects and souvenirs prized for their close association
486040	488340	with illustrious people and events.
488340	490280	Sneakers have been one of the most popular
490280	492020	forms of memorabilia to collect
492020	493560	ever since the meteoric success
493560	496440	of Nike's Air Jordan brand in the 80s.
496440	498840	In 2020, an original pair of Jordans
498840	503040	worn by Michael Jordan himself sold for $560,000,
503040	506120	becoming the most expensive sneakers in the world.
506120	509020	Of course, the decades-long supremacy of the Air Jordans
509020	512540	have recently been challenged by Kanye West's Yeezy brand,
512540	515700	and in April of this year, an original pair of Yeezys
515700	520420	worn by Kanye at the 2008 Grammy's sold for $1.8 million.
520420	523220	Memorabilia from the most prestigious athletes and artists
523220	524980	can fetch a hefty price,
524980	527460	but by far the most expensive memorabilia
527460	529980	belongs to the whimsical world of cinema.
529980	532580	Darth Vader's helmet from the Empire Strikes Back
532580	536260	sold for just under $900,000 in 2019.
536260	538420	Marilyn Monroe's iconic white dress
538420	541780	from the seven-year itch sold for $4.6 million,
541780	544260	but the most expensive memorabilia ever worn
544260	547100	by a movie star may be Dorothy's groovy slippers
547100	548740	from The Wizard of Oz.
548740	551700	The most recognizable symbol from the most beloved movie
551700	553380	of the 20th century was listed
553380	556380	at a price of $6 million in 2018.
556380	559060	Although costumes may embody iconic characters
559060	561740	more so than any other type of memorabilia,
561740	564420	vehicles end up edging them out in price.
564420	567780	James Bond's Aston Martin DB5 from Goldfinger
567780	569820	sold for $6.4 million,
569820	573060	possibly the most expensive piece of memorabilia ever sold
573060	575580	was the General Lee from Dukes of Hazzard,
575580	578340	selling for a whopping $9.9 million.
579340	581140	When we come back, we'll take a look
581140	583580	at what lies beyond the eight-figure mark.
584700	587420	Well, I can't even fucking talk to me
587420	589740	and then look me in the eyes.
589740	591700	And just a moment ago, here's what's happened.
591700	594660	A fan somehow gets out of the infield area,
594660	595540	comes out on the track,
595540	598060	and is trying to get Pat Kidd's autograph.
600580	602620	People ask me all the time,
602620	604740	Emp, how can you afford all of these
604740	607260	exceedingly rare and special items?
607260	610660	Well, everyone, where I get my money isn't important.
610660	613420	What is important is where that money doesn't go,
613420	617340	paying some stupid bank a bunch of unnecessary fees.
617340	620420	Current is looking to change the face of mobile banking,

674020	675660	you could be on your way to owning
675660	680380	that sweet 1969 Dodge Charger from Dukes of Hazzard.
680380	681380	While the General Lee
681380	684140	may be the most expensive piece of memorabilia,
684140	687060	it's far from the most expensive automobile.
687060	689300	Lamborghini is one of the most recognizable
689300	692820	exotic car brands for average Joes to daydream about.
692820	694500	A new Lamborghini Aventador
694500	697300	will set you back around $800,000
697300	700980	with just over a thousand units being produced each year.
700980	702900	That price is about 10 times less
702900	706180	than Lamborghini's most expensive model, the Veneno,
706180	709140	only 12 of which were ever sold to the public.
709140	711700	However, for the most elite car collectors,
711700	715180	a typical Lambo might as well be a Toyota Corolla.
715180	716660	It's seven o'clock in the morning
716660	720740	and Elon Musk anxiously waits for his golden payoff.
720740	723780	I expect to receive a car that I've just bought,
723780	725340	which is called McLaren F1.
726660	729580	In the 1990s, the McLaren F1 set the record
729580	732660	for the fastest top speed reached by a production car
732660	735660	and has been prized by collectors ever since.
735660	737340	Including special variants,
737340	741140	only 71 McLaren F1s were ever sold to the public
741140	742580	and recent sales of the model
742580	745380	are now approaching the $20 million mark.
745380	747340	The most expensive supercar right now
747340	750540	is the ultra rare Pagani Zana HP Barchetta
750540	753820	listed at a price of 23.5 million.
753820	756300	However, the title of the most expensive automobile
756300	759940	in the world belongs to fellow Italian automaker Ferrari.
759940	764940	In 2018, a 1963 Ferrari 250 GTO sold for 70 million,
765460	768060	truly showing that old money still reigns supreme
768060	769940	in the automotive world.
769940	772860	While car collectors have existed for over a century,
772900	775580	stamp collectors date back even further.
775580	778420	The first postage stamps were issued in the 1840s
778420	780060	by the British government.
780060	784500	In 1856, a shipment of stamps to British Guyana was delayed
784500	787260	forcing the postmaster to issue an emergency batch
787260	789420	as a temporary replacement.
789420	791580	The provisional stamps were then distributed
791580	794660	and quietly forgotten until 17 years later
794660	796700	when a young boy discovered the unusual
796700	800500	one cent magenta octagon on one of his uncle's old letters.
800500	802780	The boy would end up selling the stamp to a collector
803700	804540	for six shillings.
804540	807060	That stamp would go on to become the only surviving copy
807060	809740	of the British Guyana one cent magenta.
809740	812460	Today, it is worth over $9 million
812460	815420	and to the 60 million stamp collectors in the world,
815420	818260	no other piece of postage is more valuable.
818260	821540	If stamps are one of the oldest fixations for collectors,
821540	823660	coins may be the oldest.
823660	826060	Evidence of coin collecting dates as far back
826060	827420	as ancient Rome.
827420	829860	One of the most infamous events in Roman history
829860	832500	was the assassination of Julius Caesar.
833180	834660	Two years after usurping the throne,
834660	837700	Brutus had several coins minted to commemorate himself
837700	839940	literally getting away with murder.
839940	844460	In 2020, 2,062 years after its creation,
844460	848100	Brutus's gold coins sold for over $4 million.
848100	849980	The most expensive coin ever sold
849980	852060	happens to be another gold coin,
852060	855460	the last gold coin ever minted by the US Treasury.
855460	859100	In 1934, President Roosevelt issued an executive order
859100	862340	outlawing gold coins from general circulation.
863180	865700	The Treasury was ordered to destroy all 450,000
865700	868740	newly minted 1933 double eagles.
868740	871140	However, a few dozen were illegally rescued
871140	873140	and distributed to collectors.
873140	874740	Over the next several years,
874740	877220	the federal government located, confiscated,
877220	880100	and destroyed almost all of the remaining copies.
880100	883740	Only one double eagle acquired by King Farouk of Egypt
883740	885900	managed to evade apprehension.
885900	887940	Today, that lone coin survives
887940	891700	as the only 1933 double eagle in private possession.
891700	893060	In June of this year,
893060	896460	the coin was sold for nearly $19 million,
896460	900020	more than 900,000 times its nominal value.
900020	901500	See anything you like?
901500	904180	Yeah, I'll give you a buck 50 for this umbrella.
904180	906100	A buck 50 for that?
906100	907420	But it's an antique.
907420	910420	If you keep something in good condition for long enough,
910420	912980	it will eventually be worth a fortune.
912980	915460	Antiques provide a treasure trove of rarities
915460	917500	and have accounted for some of the most expensive
917500	919420	collectibles ever sold.
919420	921700	Action Comics No. 1 marked the beginning
921700	924340	of the superhero genre in pop culture.
924340	927860	After selling for just 10 cents apiece in 1938,
927860	930380	a mint-conditioned copy of the original Superman
930380	933140	is now worth more than $3 million.
933140	935260	In the 17th and 18th century,
935260	937740	the Stradivari family built string instruments,
937740	939260	which became world-renowned
939260	941500	for their unmatched sound quality.
941500	945940	In 2008, a Stradivarius cello sold for $20 million,
945940	949820	becoming the most expensive musical instrument in the world.
949820	952540	Leonardo da Vinci was the most recognizable figure
952540	955060	of the 15th century, and he would end up writing
955060	957380	what would eventually become the most expensive book
957380	958540	in the world.
958540	961780	In 1994, Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates
961780	963940	purchased Leonardo's Codex Leister
963940	965420	for more than $30 million.
966300	969060	Unofficially, the most expensive antique ever sold
969060	971820	was this 18th-century Qing Dynasty vase,
971820	974220	selling at auction for over $80 million.
975140	977420	It's at this point where the line between antique
977420	979740	and artwork starts to blur.
979740	981500	Approaching the nine-figure mark,
981500	983780	we are beginning to enter the highest echelon
983780	986340	of collectability, fine art.
986340	988620	For centuries, expensive artwork has served
988620	991540	as an enduring symbol of high-class society.
991540	993660	For those who are so disgustingly wealthy
993660	995420	that the concept of dollars and cents
995420	997420	has practically lost all meaning,
997420	1000260	fine art has often acted as the final frontier
1000260	1002140	of what money can buy.
1002420	1004940	Currently, Alberto Giacometti's Pointing Man
1004940	1007420	is the world's most expensive statue,
1007420	1010780	selling to a collector for $141 million.
1010780	1012940	If you consider jewelry to be art,
1012940	1015740	then the prices become even more staggering.
1015740	1018340	The infamous Hope Diamond necklace has been valued
1018340	1022580	as high as $350 million and is generally considered
1022580	1025540	to be the most expensive gem in the world.
1025540	1027820	However, some sources claim that the title
1027820	1030300	actually belongs to the Cullinan One,
1030300	1033100	the largest colorless diamond ever cut.
1033100	1035500	Part of the British royal family's scepter,
1035500	1039100	it has been valued as high as $400 million,
1039100	1040460	but that's still not as much
1040460	1043380	as the most expensive privately-owned painting,
1043380	1046020	Leonardo da Vinci's Salvador Mundi.
1046020	1051020	In 2017, it sold to a collector for $450 million
1051460	1054660	and may quite possibly be the most expensive single item
1054660	1056540	owned by any individual.
1056540	1059060	Of course, the most expensive painting in the world
1059060	1062660	is another Leonardo da Vinci work, the Mona Lisa,
1062660	1065340	the most famous painting in human history,
1065340	1069180	a work of art so valuable that it defies private ownership.
1069180	1071180	The Mona Lisa is technically property
1071180	1072500	of the nation of France
1072500	1075580	and resides on permanent display at the Louvre.
1075580	1079500	It has an insured value of over $800 million,
1079500	1082380	equivalent to the GDP of Samoa.
1082380	1086220	Beyond this point, we struggle to accurately appraise items.
1086220	1088580	Anything more valuable starts to enter the realm
1088940	1090220	of pricelessness.
1090220	1093340	Certain items are deemed so anthropologically important
1093340	1096460	that they transcend collectability and ownership.
1096460	1099780	It's possible that ancient artifacts like the Rosetta Stone
1099780	1102100	may be more valuable than the Mona Lisa,
1102100	1104700	but we may never know if it really is.
1104700	1106620	It's insightful to discover the point
1106620	1108900	at which we stop pricing items.
1108900	1111300	Based on what we know about how older objects
1111300	1114900	continue to become significantly rarer and more expensive,
1114900	1118100	then this 40,000-year-old flute made out of a mammoth tusk
1118100	1120580	should intuitively be one of the most valuable items
1120580	1121620	in the world.
1121620	1124820	However, the mammoth flute has substantially less fanfare
1124820	1126820	than a Stradivarius violin,
1126820	1129620	despite the flute being 100 times older.
1129620	1132100	This exception may reveal what exactly it is
1132100	1135260	we find valuable about collecting rare items.
1135260	1136260	Welcome to the Batcave.
1136260	1139020	This is the Guinness World Record Batman collection.
1139020	1141700	The act of collecting is far from rare.
1141700	1144900	At least a third of Americans collect something.
1144940	1146740	When I was a kid, I used to collect
1146740	1149540	164-scale die-cast NASCARs,
1149540	1152300	and I can truly say that it was one of the most satisfying
1152300	1155540	and rewarding hobbies I've ever participated in.
1155540	1159700	But why exactly do so many of us find collecting so rewarding?
1159700	1163220	The psychology of collecting is not very well understood,
1163220	1165420	but our obsession with rarity may result
1165420	1166900	from our brain's innate desire
1166900	1169220	to seek out the extraordinary.
1169220	1171180	The modern-day activity of collecting
1171180	1174100	is largely a manifestation of foraging for food
1174100	1175780	in prehistoric times.
1175780	1177260	For our early ancestors,
1177260	1180020	discovering novel and unique forms of sustenance
1180020	1182020	meant a better chance at survival.
1182020	1184740	Thus, our brains adapted to release dopamine
1184740	1188420	whenever we are presented with new, extraordinary items.
1188420	1191660	Obtaining food is no longer the satisfying challenge
1191660	1193020	that it once was,
1193020	1195220	and present-day collectors may be attempting
1195220	1197100	to recreate the rush of discovering
1197100	1199260	a new berry in the wilderness.
1199260	1202580	The subconscious desire to recapture our foraging roots
1202620	1205380	may be but a microcosm of a far greater desire
1205380	1207660	to recapture our tribal roots.
1207660	1210540	Today, we live in a very alienating society,
1210540	1212980	a far cry from the tightly-knit clans
1212980	1215180	which our ancestors occupied.
1215180	1217780	When we spend 400 million on a painting,
1217780	1219380	or nine million on a stamp,
1219380	1222020	or 150,000 on a virtual gun,
1222020	1224340	we are not just buying a rare item.
1224340	1227020	In many ways, we are buying into the community
1227020	1229580	that comes with owning a rare item.
1229580	1231820	The act of foraging in prehistoric times
1231820	1235580	was as much of a social event as it was a day-to-day task.
1235580	1238300	It provided people with constant opportunities
1238300	1241300	to demonstrate their usefulness towards their peers.
1241300	1243660	Forging allowed people to feel valued
1243660	1245700	by the community around them.
1245700	1247980	We now live in an era where the average person
1247980	1250540	has arguably never felt less valued.
1250540	1252700	For many, joining a niche subculture
1252700	1254700	is their only way to rekindle feelings
1254700	1256420	of esteem and belonging.
1256420	1259780	For collectors, it's a matter of finding a unified culture,
1259780	1263620	one which truly represents their ideals and motivations.
1263620	1266900	This may help justify why a 400-year-old violin
1266900	1270820	is so much more desirable than a 40,000-year-old flute.
1270820	1272660	When an item becomes too old,
1272660	1274540	it loses the cultural relevance
1274540	1276860	that makes it so compelling to us.
1276860	1279260	People don't necessarily pay nine figures
1279260	1280580	on an original da Vinci
1280580	1283940	because it's centuries old or aesthetically pleasing.
1283940	1285500	What they are truly paying for
1285500	1288140	is a slice of what da Vinci represents.
1288140	1290780	They want to attach themselves to the prestige
1290780	1293580	that Leonardo da Vinci's name carries.
1293580	1297020	People admire da Vinci, Michael Jordan, Superman.
1297020	1299740	Maybe if we own an iconic piece of them,
1299740	1302060	we can be admired too.
1302060	1303580	While the impulse to collect
1303580	1306340	once helped us gather survival resources,
1306340	1309540	today it may be helping us gather social resources,
1309540	1311740	which many are now finding more scarce
1311740	1313820	than food, water, and shelter.
1313820	1316500	For some, collecting rarities is the first step
1316500	1318060	in connecting with others,
1318060	1320860	and engaging with an exclusive culture.
1320860	1323580	The rest of us may consider it a waste of money,
1323580	1325180	but for certain collectors,
1325180	1328660	belonging to something meaningful is worth every penny.
1328660	1330140	In addition to belonging,
1330140	1333140	collecting may be attempting to account for another aspect
1333140	1337500	many find sorely lacking from modern society, autonomy.
1337500	1338740	With each passing year,
1338740	1340820	the world around us gets more complex,
1340820	1343380	more chaotic, and more unpredictable.
1343380	1344700	You can't go a few moments
1344700	1346340	without discovering some new threat
1346340	1349740	that you didn't even realize it was possible to worry about.
1349740	1352620	After a while, it all starts to become overwhelming,
1352620	1354740	and most of us end up feeling more and more
1354740	1356700	like riders on the storm.
1356700	1358740	Collecting may be one of our most effective
1358740	1361660	psychological mechanisms at reclaiming autonomy
1361660	1364180	in the face of chaos and uncertainty.
1364180	1366940	Cultivating order out of so many disparate objects
1366940	1370060	can help anchor us to a more stable state of mind.
1370060	1373860	In this sense, collecting may serve as a therapeutic activity
1373860	1376700	especially for those who've experienced trauma.
1376700	1379540	It's no wonder why the recent explosion in collecting
1379540	1382020	occurred when most of us were in lockdown,
1382020	1386420	a period when many had never felt more uncertain and isolated.
1386420	1388900	No matter the reason we collect rare items,
1388900	1392260	it's clear that many of us are far better off because of it.
1392260	1394460	And if the past year has shown us anything,
1394460	1397860	it's that collecting isn't going away anytime soon.
1397860	1400140	In the time I've been working on this video,
1400140	1403500	several of its records have already become outdated.
1403500	1406740	The future of collecting is more exciting than ever before.
1406740	1410140	Following the advent of cryptocurrency and digital assets,
1410140	1411980	non-fungible tokens have spawned
1411980	1414300	a whole new genre of collectibles.
1414300	1417900	In June of 2017, Creative Studio Larva Labs
1417900	1421380	released a limited supply of 10,000 unique crypto punks
1421380	1423620	for free on the Ethereum network.
1423620	1425900	Each punk was algorithmically generated
1425900	1427940	to have one or more distinct features,
1427940	1430900	with about 100 spawning with a special classification
1430900	1434620	of zombie, ape, or the rarest of all, alien.
1434620	1438300	In March of this year, one of the nine alien crypto punks
1438300	1440980	sold for $7.6 million,
1440980	1444580	becoming the most expensive NFT ever sold.
1444580	1446940	One day later, digital artist Beeple
1446940	1450140	would shatter that record with his composition Everydays,
1450140	1452940	a collage of all 5,000 images that he published
1452940	1456540	over a time span dating back to May 2007.
1456540	1461140	The Everydays NFT was purchased for over $69 million,
1461140	1464180	about 8% the value of the Mona Lisa,
1464180	1467540	a hell of a price to pay for a bunch of worthless pixels.
1486540	1487540	.
