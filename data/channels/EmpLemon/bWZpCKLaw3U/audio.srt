00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,440
Holy shit guys, I am so completely fucked right now.

2
00:00:03,460 --> 00:00:05,060
YouTube heroes.

3
00:00:05,060 --> 00:00:10,740
If you haven't heard the news yet, YouTube has announced new policy where you can earn points in a game!

4
00:00:10,760 --> 00:00:13,000
For flagging people's videos!

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:17,980
Now I'm not here to explain the video, other YouTubers have done a much better job than I ever could...

6
00:00:17,980 --> 00:00:21,760
But I'm just looking at this from my perspective and I'm here to say that...

7
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:26,000
IT'S ALL OVER PEOPLE! WE DON'T HAVE A PRAYER!

8
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,220
AAAAAAAAAAA

9
00:00:27,220 --> 00:00:30,220
Guys, I've pissed off a lot of children over the years.

10
00:00:30,220 --> 00:00:33,020
Oh, jeez, I don't really agree.

11
00:00:33,020 --> 00:00:35,020
Suck a fucking dick, baguette.

12
00:00:35,020 --> 00:00:37,220
And those are the people that are gonna be running this thing.

13
00:00:37,220 --> 00:00:40,720
Because it's an unpaid job where all you get are virtual points.

14
00:00:40,720 --> 00:00:44,820
So you're saying I should do your job for you at home for free?

15
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:46,820
I'd love it!

16
00:00:46,820 --> 00:00:53,320
And the only people who will actually volunteer their time for this are fucking children who are too young to get a paying job.

17
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:56,320
I understand the metaphor that children run this website.

18
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:59,320
But now children are going to be literally running this website.

19
00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:03,320
Well, it's been nice knowing you guys, but my time here is coming to an end.

20
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:07,320
I've pissed off too many kids over the years, and now they have the tools to get revenge.

21
00:01:08,820 --> 00:01:11,820
Don't fix that shit!

22
00:01:13,820 --> 00:01:16,820
Oh my god! Oh my god!

23
00:01:16,820 --> 00:01:18,820
Terrorists win.

24
00:01:18,820 --> 00:01:29,820
This is the end, beautiful friend.

25
00:01:39,820 --> 00:01:41,820
Children! I wanna die!

26
00:01:41,820 --> 00:01:45,320
What the fuck? What the fuck? What the fuck is this?

27
00:01:45,320 --> 00:01:47,820
Just when I thought they couldn't get any stupider.

28
00:01:48,820 --> 00:01:55,820
Where have all the good men gone, and where are all the gods?

29
00:02:05,820 --> 00:02:06,820
YouTube!

30
00:02:07,820 --> 00:02:10,820
Look at this photograph!

31
00:02:13,820 --> 00:02:17,320
Look at it! Look at it! Look at it!

32
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:22,320
The only thing that's for sure about YouTube is fucking things suck!
