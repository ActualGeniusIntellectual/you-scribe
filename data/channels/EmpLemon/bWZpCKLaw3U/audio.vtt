00:00.000 --> 00:03.440
Holy shit guys, I am so completely fucked right now.

00:03.460 --> 00:05.060
YouTube heroes.

00:05.060 --> 00:10.740
If you haven't heard the news yet, YouTube has announced new policy where you can earn points in a game!

00:10.760 --> 00:13.000
For flagging people's videos!

00:13.000 --> 00:17.980
Now I'm not here to explain the video, other YouTubers have done a much better job than I ever could...

00:17.980 --> 00:21.760
But I'm just looking at this from my perspective and I'm here to say that...

00:21.760 --> 00:26.000
IT'S ALL OVER PEOPLE! WE DON'T HAVE A PRAYER!

00:26.000 --> 00:27.220
AAAAAAAAAAA

00:27.220 --> 00:30.220
Guys, I've pissed off a lot of children over the years.

00:30.220 --> 00:33.020
Oh, jeez, I don't really agree.

00:33.020 --> 00:35.020
Suck a fucking dick, baguette.

00:35.020 --> 00:37.220
And those are the people that are gonna be running this thing.

00:37.220 --> 00:40.720
Because it's an unpaid job where all you get are virtual points.

00:40.720 --> 00:44.820
So you're saying I should do your job for you at home for free?

00:45.420 --> 00:46.820
I'd love it!

00:46.820 --> 00:53.320
And the only people who will actually volunteer their time for this are fucking children who are too young to get a paying job.

00:53.320 --> 00:56.320
I understand the metaphor that children run this website.

00:56.320 --> 00:59.320
But now children are going to be literally running this website.

00:59.320 --> 01:03.320
Well, it's been nice knowing you guys, but my time here is coming to an end.

01:03.320 --> 01:07.320
I've pissed off too many kids over the years, and now they have the tools to get revenge.

01:08.820 --> 01:11.820
Don't fix that shit!

01:13.820 --> 01:16.820
Oh my god! Oh my god!

01:16.820 --> 01:18.820
Terrorists win.

01:18.820 --> 01:29.820
This is the end, beautiful friend.

01:39.820 --> 01:41.820
Children! I wanna die!

01:41.820 --> 01:45.320
What the fuck? What the fuck? What the fuck is this?

01:45.320 --> 01:47.820
Just when I thought they couldn't get any stupider.

01:48.820 --> 01:55.820
Where have all the good men gone, and where are all the gods?

02:05.820 --> 02:06.820
YouTube!

02:07.820 --> 02:10.820
Look at this photograph!

02:13.820 --> 02:17.320
Look at it! Look at it! Look at it!

02:17.320 --> 02:22.320
The only thing that's for sure about YouTube is fucking things suck!
