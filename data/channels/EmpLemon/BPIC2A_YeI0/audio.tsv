0	3540	You pop this piece of crap in and what do you get?
3540	10300	There is an enormous problem right now with people and corporations in the music industry
10300	17980	that are unlawfully and religiously claiming works that were made fully legally by YouTube
17980	18980	channels.
18980	23940	Where I got a mail from YouTube saying that someone named Ram just claimed my video, which
23940	28280	means that the video is still running but the revenue from advertising now goes into
28280	30960	his pocket instead of my pocket.
30960	37840	They have copyright claimed just over 400 of my total catalogue of videos.
37840	41600	This is two separate claims coming from two different companies.
41600	45440	This is clearly an attempt to censor the video from multiple angles.
45440	46440	It's premeditated.
46440	49640	And it's really nothing but pure censorship.
49640	50640	Hush.
50640	53640	Let me go with you.
53640	59200	Good lord, what is happening in there?
59200	62120	I mean, I know you're a sophisticated guy.
62120	63120	The world is a mess.
63120	64120	The world is as angry as it gets.
64120	75140	When you think this is going to cause a little more anger, the world is an angry place.
75140	79440	If you're searching for evidence that we live in a clown-based society, look no further
79440	81680	than YouTube's copyright system.
81680	85240	Last year I posted an episode of YouTube Geographic where I talked about the origin
85240	88120	and development of YouTube's Content ID system.
88120	92720	I ended the episode with the implication that the copyright system improved over time.
92720	95320	But is that actually true or just wishful thinking?
95320	100720	Well, if you compare now with 2008, the system certainly seems better, as nowadays you're
100720	105380	far less likely to get your channel striked and terminated as part of a copyright claim.
105380	109400	But I'm not sure whether to attribute this to the system improving or copyright claimants
109400	110400	getting smarter.
110400	115680	You see, in the beginning when YouTube was just a sketchy, wild west site, media companies
115680	117680	wanted nothing to do with it.
117680	123220	Many companies like Viacom threatened YouTube with lawsuit after lawsuit for copyright infringement.
123220	128440	When YouTube finally appeased the media companies with Content ID, their only means of controlling
128440	131120	the content was a scorched earth policy.
131120	137280	2008 to 2009 was probably the worst ever time to upload copyrighted content to YouTube.
137280	142020	Any channel at this time uploading montages, remixes, or YouTube poops faced serious risk
142020	144720	of losing everything one day out of the blue.
144720	149560	Minor use of copyrighted music frequently resulted in entire videos getting muted or
149560	153840	worse, replaced with a dreaded YouTube audio swap song.
153840	155840	Stop!
163800	167560	Some time later, copyright punishments got a little less severe.
167560	172340	Around 2010, media companies began blocking content rather than removing it.
172340	176720	Still a major obstacle for YouTubers, but at least it was preferable to the nuclear
176720	177960	option.
177960	182420	Also around this time, Google introduced their AdSense program to YouTube videos, meaning
182460	187980	it was now possible to earn money from content on YouTube, and thus, a new form of copyright
187980	190900	claim became available to rights holders.
190900	192820	Revenue collection.
192820	198240	Eventually, media companies began to realize that monetizing claimed content was a much
198240	202700	better option than just removing it, since they could basically generate free revenue
202700	205420	from virtually no effort on their part.
205420	209140	At first this was a very welcome change, at least in my experience.
209140	213420	I wasn't making money from my YouTube poops anyway, I just wanted them to be seen.
213420	217920	So when copyright claimants stopped blocking my videos and simply ran ads on them, it was
217920	220380	no skin off my back.
220380	224260	Monetization used to be a rare privilege on YouTube reserved only for the top creators
224260	225400	on the site.
225400	230460	Over time, however, the advent of MCNs made monetization much more accessible, so our
230460	234300	standards and expectations of earning YouTube revenue changed.
234300	239380	Unfortunately, the Content ID system didn't change alongside our expectations.
239380	244780	All of a sudden, monetization became an entitlement rather than a dream, and the once benign revenue
244780	248660	collection from media companies became a much more pervasive issue.
248660	253820	The Content ID system only really improved in its ability to detect content and not in
253820	258860	its ability to differentiate remixes and reviews from shameless re-uploads.
258860	262740	At some points, the media conglomerates were the least of our concern.
262740	267900	People like Derek Savage and Matt Haas began abusing the system to silence criticism.
267900	270860	Fair use was totally thrown by the wayside.
270860	275900	Content creators suffered, while abusive claimants faced no consequences whatsoever.
275900	281100	Even now, ten whole years after the introduction of Content ID, YouTube's copyright system
281100	286680	is still very flawed, with many blatant issues remaining unresolved and unaddressed.
286680	291620	But with that being said, this is the system in place, and YouTubers have had to accept
291620	293780	that this is our reality.
293780	299060	If you want to succeed on YouTube, you must go through the Content ID system, and as the
299060	305540	system has become more advanced, so too have the strategies YouTubers use to outsmart it.
305540	309660	Strategies that essentially answer the question, how much copyrighted stuff can I use and still
309660	310940	get paid?
310940	313740	Using copyrighted content is inherently risky.
313740	317940	The more you use, the more likely you are to lose out on revenue for a video.
317940	323260	However, the more you avoid copyrighted material, the more you risk your content becoming bland,
323260	326300	repetitive, and unengaging for new viewers.
326300	330180	It's a delicate balance, and to this day no one knows for sure the best way to approach
330180	335500	this conundrum, a conundrum I like to call the YouTube copyright metagame.
335500	351620	The metagame can essentially be represented by a spectrum of risk, specifically the risk
351620	356420	of tripping the Content ID system through the use of copyrighted content in your video.
356420	359700	How close can you get to the fire without getting burned?
359700	364140	Starting at the very left of the spectrum, you will find the least risky option possible,
364140	373700	Mr. Clean, the type of content where you don't use any copyrighted material because
373700	374980	you don't need it.
374980	378560	This style used to be much more common in the early days of YouTube, where people would
378560	382100	just flip on a webcam and upload a raw video of themselves talking.
382100	386420	Theoretically, this stuff should be safe from even the most slimy copyright abuse.
386420	391360	It's strictly original by design, and using external copyrighted sources is completely
391360	395640	unnecessary to the purpose of the content, making it the least risky type of video on
395640	396640	the site.
396640	400380	But with that being said, there's a reason why you don't really see this type of video
400380	401720	much anymore.
401720	406500	Nowadays, audiences expect a little more than a raw video of you making a sandwich.
406500	410920	So unless you're very talented, in a very specific niche, or have very high production
410920	413840	value, people aren't really going to be rushing to watch you.
413840	419120	Unlike the old days, most modern genres on YouTube do benefit from using multimedia assets
419120	422080	like external music, images, and footage.
422080	425420	So much so that it's almost a requirement for growing your channel.
425420	442720	But despite this, there are some creators who choose not to do it regardless.
442720	447360	The cold turkey is very similar to Mr. Clean, the only difference being that cold turkeys
447360	451780	abstain from using copyrighted material even though their videos could conceivably benefit
451780	452840	from it.
452840	457980	A big example that comes to mind here is Kurzgesagt, a science channel that painstakingly ensures
457980	460980	that all of their assets are original content.
460980	465280	And although they have successfully eliminated the risk of a copyright dispute, the costs
465280	470440	are enormous, requiring a team of people spending hundreds of hours per video drawing and animating
470440	474320	visual components in addition to composing original music.
474320	478960	Clearly, this tremendous amount of effort is not exactly feasible for smaller channels
478960	480640	who can't spare the expense.
480640	485800	A lot of you have been commenting asking me why I'm no longer playing clips of songs in
485800	492640	my videos, how come I'm not playing the clips, why aren't I playing the clips, and basically
492640	496600	my answer to that question is copyright.
496600	500840	Anthony Fantano is another YouTube creator who seems to avoid using copyrighted material
500840	502560	at all costs.
502600	507600	Why I chose not to use copyrighted material in my reviews despite it being a very common
507600	510840	practice among YouTube reviewers.
510840	513840	It's just really a time-consuming process and something that just ends up being like
513840	518240	a real nail-biter at the end of the day because I'm worried about whether or not this video
518240	521900	is, am I gonna get revenue off of that, am I gonna get revenue off of this, is this going
521900	527460	to affect whether or not the next video is monetized or this, that, and the other thing.
527460	530640	It's just kind of a headache I would rather not focus on because I have to put out so
530640	537920	much content all the time and I feel like just spending all of that time, all of that
537920	543260	effort on just refuting claims and fighting with this label and fighting with that label
543260	547120	and responding to this and responding to that, it's just a waste of my time.
547120	551800	Media criticism is a genre that can benefit greatly from using copyrighted works to provide
551800	554920	the viewer with direct examples of the elements being reviewed.
554920	559840	However, on Fantano's music review channel The Needle Drop, he abstains from using any
559840	562280	song samples within his reviews.
562280	566920	This creates the rather unfortunate consequence of his reviews lacking context for audience
566920	569640	members unfamiliar with the specific work.
569640	573200	This appears to have the effect of making his viewership dependent on the popularity
573200	577680	of the song or album rather than intrinsic to the channel itself.
577680	581880	Fantano has only been able to overcome this because of his unrivaled consistency and longevity
581880	583080	in the medium.
583080	587560	As one of the first regular music reviewers on YouTube, he quickly established himself
587560	592240	as the premier music critic on not just YouTube but the internet in general.
617560	631340	Most YouTubers, however, don't have the benefit of pioneering a genre.
631340	636440	It's difficult to imagine another critic becoming popular doing what Fantano does.
636440	640720	YouTubers must innovate their approaches if they want to avoid getting labeled as a derivative
640720	641720	clone.
641720	646040	And frequently, this innovation requires the use of copyrighted material, which is where
646040	649660	we find the copyright strategist I call the fair users.
649660	654080	This is where you'll find a majority of your film, TV, and video game reviewers in addition
654080	657440	to a lot of drama, news, and commentary channels.
657440	661760	This type of media is dependent on discussing and critiquing someone else's content, whether
661760	665240	it's owned by a movie studio or some other YouTuber.
665240	669640	This content falls under the legal defense of fair use, which theoretically protects
669640	671880	it from claims of copyright infringement.
671880	676280	However, as we've discussed earlier, rights holders on YouTube don't really care about
676280	677480	fair use.
677480	682620	The Content ID system cannot determine the context of the copyrighted material, it can
682620	685160	only detect whether it's used at all.
685160	689960	So technically, according to YouTube's automated systems, there's very little separating a
689960	693480	movie review from a direct upload of that same movie.
693480	699500	Which brings me to the bootleggers.
699500	703580	At the very far right of the spectrum, you'll find the closest thing to an organized crime
703580	709240	syndicate on YouTube, the very people that Content ID is trying to stop, people who literally
709240	713240	upload unedited clips of movies and TV shows.
713240	716420	These guys have been around since the very beginning of the website.
716420	720920	YouTube itself was supposedly created because its founder, Jad Karim, wanted to see a live
720920	723780	TV clip that he couldn't find anywhere else.
723780	729380	The origins of YouTube are rooted in the bootlegger, the faceless silent mavericks of YouTube who
729380	733420	make sure that no epic movie one-liner goes unuploaded.
733420	738020	It was this type of content which instigated the Viacom lawsuit in the first place and
738020	741420	directly led to the implementation of Content ID.
741420	746620	Nowadays, almost every major TV network, movie studio, and record company has their own YouTube
746620	748400	channels to dump clips.
748400	752500	But back in the day, these bootleggers were all we had, and love em or hate em, they were
752500	756300	instrumental in driving traffic to the site when it was just starting out.
756300	758520	And they arguably still are today.
758520	763120	So the next time you see a Family Guy Funny Moments compilation pop into your recommended,
763120	766940	you can be thankful, because no traffic means no YouTube.
766940	770840	And many of you watching now are only here because you were first introduced to the site
770840	773520	by binging unlicensed TV clips.
773520	776640	The bootleggers walked so YouTubers could run.
776640	780120	You don't have to respect them, but you have to acknowledge the role they play on this
780120	781120	site.
781120	786480	But with that being said, they are uploading exclusively copyrighted content, and no, slapping
786480	789720	on a euphoric After Effects intro doesn't change that.
789720	793440	So I can't really feel bad for them when they get caught, considering the copyright
793440	796220	system literally exists to stop them.
796220	800480	So so far we've covered the riskiest copyright strategy, and the safest.
800480	802120	So what about everything in between?
802120	807080	Well, that's the part of the spectrum I affectionately refer to as No Man's Land,
807080	808940	and the place I like to call home.
808940	813440	It just so happens that I and a lot of other YouTubers use copyrighted content just for
813440	814440	the hell of it.
814440	818760	I can't speak for everyone else, but I do it simply because it's a style I've adapted
818760	820900	since my days in YouTube Poop.
820900	825200	Anyone familiar with the history of the genre is aware that we've been terrorized by copyright
825200	829700	claims for ages, dating back to when the system was much less forgiving.
829700	834600	So many channels were barbarically slaughtered for daring to upload videos of SpongeBob shooting
834600	835820	Patrick.
835820	840260	In modern times, meme channels have to deal with a lot of the same pitfalls.
840260	846260	We are a noble and proud people, simply making humorous edits for the enjoyment of others.
846260	851220	Even though the fruits of our labor get shamelessly reposted elsewhere, we never remix our sources
851220	852860	with the same intent.
852860	857100	In terms of our approach to copyright, you can call us the Transformers, because our
857100	861260	work is transformative and supposedly under the protection of fair use.
861260	866260	When a copyrighted work is remixed, altered, or edited, it has theoretically been transformed
866260	871180	beyond the confines of its original purpose and should therefore be treated as an entirely
871180	872360	new entity.
872360	876880	To put it simply, people who want to watch The Incredibles aren't going to tune into
876880	880380	my eight-minute nonsensical remix of The Incredibles.
880380	883580	They're gonna pay for the full-length movie or pirate it.
883580	887760	My remix is not attempting to siphon revenue off the original work.
887760	891500	My viewers are not trying to skirt around paying for a movie ticket.
891500	895420	They're watching to see my artistic interpretation of the source material.
895420	900220	It's the same reason why Andy Warhol's paintings can't be classified as an advertisement for
900220	901500	Campbell's Soup.
901500	905340	He transformed the original work into something completely distinct.
905340	910540	However, in the eyes of the copyright holder on YouTube, it doesn't make much of a difference.
910540	915420	If you use any significant amount of copyrighted footage regardless of the context, you are
915420	917080	likely to get claimed.
917080	920740	And this is largely due to how the Content ID system is administered.
920740	927380	You've reached the Navy's Automated Phone Service.
927380	932660	Earlier this year, YouTube released an alternate version of their Content ID tool for creators
932660	934740	in the YouTube Studio Beta.
934740	939580	While it does not grant creators the same revenue-sharing privileges as media companies,
939580	944300	it does provide us with insight on what these companies see while claiming our content.
944300	948460	Basically, within the Copyright tab, you'll see a list of other people's videos that the
948460	951420	system detected to match content in your videos.
951420	955420	Presumably, media companies have the additional option to claim revenue from each video on
955420	959780	the list regardless of the context, amount used, or whether the claimant even watched
959780	960960	the video.
960960	965060	This highly streamlined system is great for rights holders and terrible for pretty much
965060	966060	everyone else.
966060	970160	Essentially, there's nothing stopping media companies from just spamming revenue claims
970160	973620	on every video that winds up on the content claims list.
973620	978300	Theoretically, YouTubers are supposed to have a means of countering bogus claims in accordance
978300	982640	with the DMCA, but in practice, that simply isn't the case.
982640	988560	On YouTube, the claimant presides as the judge, jury, and executioner in copyright disputes.
988560	992480	Appeals and counterclaims mean nothing when their outcome is determined by the same people
992480	995460	who issued the claim in the first place.
995460	1000100	Once the copyright holder inevitably rejects all of your appeals, your only option to reverse
1000100	1003220	the claim is to literally take the claimant to court.
1003220	1008300	Basically all YouTubers are just small, private citizens who can't afford to fight multi-million
1008300	1011080	dollar corporations in a lengthy court battle.
1011080	1016100	In a legal war of attrition, the corporation will always win, and when you factor in how
1016100	1021020	the cost of even entering a lawsuit will greatly exceed any revenue you would gain from the
1021020	1025200	video, this makes legal action a non-existent option in practice.
1025200	1029680	In the world of YouTube copyright, the claimant holds all of the leverage.
1029680	1034280	The way YouTube sees it, they earn the same cut of revenue no matter who claims the video,
1034280	1037620	so they don't exactly have much of an incentive to change this.
1037620	1041400	Imagine if your ex-wife was in charge of determining your alimony payment.
1041400	1043400	Doesn't really seem fair, does it?
1043400	1047500	Well, that's the system we have on YouTube, and I've personally had to deal with it
1047500	1049440	time and time again.
1049440	1054900	Episode 2 of Never Ever had its revenue claimed by WWE for using less than a minute of content.
1054900	1059560	I was discouraged, but I was actually willing to settle for this because I was done worrying
1059560	1063240	about it and I just wanted the video to go online for people to see.
1063240	1070280	Then, a few hours after making it public, WWE blocked the video worldwide.
1070280	1076680	So in review, I uploaded a video basically giving WWE free praise, free promotion, and
1076680	1079320	free revenue, and they took a look at that and said,
1079320	1081680	Duh, no, we don't want any of that.
1081680	1088680	We're gonna instead choose to be as belligerent as possible to assert our copyright dominance.
1088680	1093480	My appeal was, predictably, rejected, leaving me with no choice but to re-cut the parts
1093480	1095560	and re-upload the entire video.
1095560	1099800	And hey, this time, the Content ID system didn't detect anything, and I gotta keep
1099800	1101800	all the revenue for myself.
1101800	1107580	So in conclusion, WWE can suck a fart out of my ass, your programming is hot garbage,
1107580	1113040	and I can't wait to start watching AEW this fall, Wednesdays on TNT, and let this serve
1113040	1117600	as a permanent reminder to all of you that media companies don't care one bit about
1117600	1119400	the context of your video.
1119400	1124880	They will shut you down, without warning, for no reason, even if your video benefits
1124880	1127080	them in every conceivable way.
1127080	1131520	So if you think that these media companies are willing to spare a single minute of time
1131520	1137720	to give your video a fair review, then you are sorely mistaken on how little these companies
1137720	1138720	care.
1138720	1142520	If you want your videos to get through the copyright system unscathed, you can't rely
1142520	1145240	on media companies to be nice.
1145240	1149320	Often times, the people in charge of manually reviewing the claims seem more robotic than
1149320	1151620	the automated system itself.
1151620	1156320	So with that being said, the discretion of the copyright system depends almost entirely
1156320	1159640	on whether or not you can sneak past the bot undetected.
1159640	1164000	And in order to do that, we're going to have to investigate the dark arts of copyright
1164000	1165000	smuggling.
1165000	1169800	Coming up in part 2 of YouTube Copyright School, we take a look at the techniques YouTubers
1169800	1171680	use to avoid getting claimed.
1171680	1178300	She's a defense!
1178300	1184040	People of society, it is I, Joker Emp, here to tell you that enough is enough.
1184040	1189020	I have had it with getting copyright claimed, getting demonetized, getting pushed around
1189020	1191960	by this cruel, unfeeling world.
1191960	1196400	Society has stolen my precious ad revenue for long enough, and I figure it's about time
1196400	1197640	I return the favor.
1197640	1202400	Now don't you bother touching that dial, because I'm currently broadcasting live around the
1202400	1203400	world.
1203400	1207560	That's right, ladies and gentlemen, I've successfully hacked into all of your machines using the
1207560	1209720	power of the downward spiral.
1209720	1214040	And now, you're all about to witness what happens when YouTubers rise up.
1214040	1218440	If you're seeing this message, then your personal information has already been harvested and
1218440	1220240	sold to the Chinese.
1220240	1224560	And I got away with it too, all because you people connected to public Wi-Fi without a
1224560	1225880	VPN.
1225880	1230400	All those times I tried to sell you NordVPN, you scoffed and clicked away.
1230400	1232280	Well, guess what, you fools?
1232280	1236920	You should have used my affiliate link to purchase NordVPN for 70% off the three-year
1236920	1240440	plan, because now, you're all gonna pay.
1240440	1241440	Bahaha!
1241440	1244440	Who's demonetized now?
1255880	1269400	You can leave and be coughing though if you want, that's your choice I suppose.
