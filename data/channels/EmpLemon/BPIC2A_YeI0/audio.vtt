00:00.000 --> 00:03.540
You pop this piece of crap in and what do you get?

00:03.540 --> 00:10.300
There is an enormous problem right now with people and corporations in the music industry

00:10.300 --> 00:17.980
that are unlawfully and religiously claiming works that were made fully legally by YouTube

00:17.980 --> 00:18.980
channels.

00:18.980 --> 00:23.940
Where I got a mail from YouTube saying that someone named Ram just claimed my video, which

00:23.940 --> 00:28.280
means that the video is still running but the revenue from advertising now goes into

00:28.280 --> 00:30.960
his pocket instead of my pocket.

00:30.960 --> 00:37.840
They have copyright claimed just over 400 of my total catalogue of videos.

00:37.840 --> 00:41.600
This is two separate claims coming from two different companies.

00:41.600 --> 00:45.440
This is clearly an attempt to censor the video from multiple angles.

00:45.440 --> 00:46.440
It's premeditated.

00:46.440 --> 00:49.640
And it's really nothing but pure censorship.

00:49.640 --> 00:50.640
Hush.

00:50.640 --> 00:53.640
Let me go with you.

00:53.640 --> 00:59.200
Good lord, what is happening in there?

00:59.200 --> 01:02.120
I mean, I know you're a sophisticated guy.

01:02.120 --> 01:03.120
The world is a mess.

01:03.120 --> 01:04.120
The world is as angry as it gets.

01:04.120 --> 01:15.140
When you think this is going to cause a little more anger, the world is an angry place.

01:15.140 --> 01:19.440
If you're searching for evidence that we live in a clown-based society, look no further

01:19.440 --> 01:21.680
than YouTube's copyright system.

01:21.680 --> 01:25.240
Last year I posted an episode of YouTube Geographic where I talked about the origin

01:25.240 --> 01:28.120
and development of YouTube's Content ID system.

01:28.120 --> 01:32.720
I ended the episode with the implication that the copyright system improved over time.

01:32.720 --> 01:35.320
But is that actually true or just wishful thinking?

01:35.320 --> 01:40.720
Well, if you compare now with 2008, the system certainly seems better, as nowadays you're

01:40.720 --> 01:45.380
far less likely to get your channel striked and terminated as part of a copyright claim.

01:45.380 --> 01:49.400
But I'm not sure whether to attribute this to the system improving or copyright claimants

01:49.400 --> 01:50.400
getting smarter.

01:50.400 --> 01:55.680
You see, in the beginning when YouTube was just a sketchy, wild west site, media companies

01:55.680 --> 01:57.680
wanted nothing to do with it.

01:57.680 --> 02:03.220
Many companies like Viacom threatened YouTube with lawsuit after lawsuit for copyright infringement.

02:03.220 --> 02:08.440
When YouTube finally appeased the media companies with Content ID, their only means of controlling

02:08.440 --> 02:11.120
the content was a scorched earth policy.

02:11.120 --> 02:17.280
2008 to 2009 was probably the worst ever time to upload copyrighted content to YouTube.

02:17.280 --> 02:22.020
Any channel at this time uploading montages, remixes, or YouTube poops faced serious risk

02:22.020 --> 02:24.720
of losing everything one day out of the blue.

02:24.720 --> 02:29.560
Minor use of copyrighted music frequently resulted in entire videos getting muted or

02:29.560 --> 02:33.840
worse, replaced with a dreaded YouTube audio swap song.

02:33.840 --> 02:35.840
Stop!

02:43.800 --> 02:47.560
Some time later, copyright punishments got a little less severe.

02:47.560 --> 02:52.340
Around 2010, media companies began blocking content rather than removing it.

02:52.340 --> 02:56.720
Still a major obstacle for YouTubers, but at least it was preferable to the nuclear

02:56.720 --> 02:57.960
option.

02:57.960 --> 03:02.420
Also around this time, Google introduced their AdSense program to YouTube videos, meaning

03:02.460 --> 03:07.980
it was now possible to earn money from content on YouTube, and thus, a new form of copyright

03:07.980 --> 03:10.900
claim became available to rights holders.

03:10.900 --> 03:12.820
Revenue collection.

03:12.820 --> 03:18.240
Eventually, media companies began to realize that monetizing claimed content was a much

03:18.240 --> 03:22.700
better option than just removing it, since they could basically generate free revenue

03:22.700 --> 03:25.420
from virtually no effort on their part.

03:25.420 --> 03:29.140
At first this was a very welcome change, at least in my experience.

03:29.140 --> 03:33.420
I wasn't making money from my YouTube poops anyway, I just wanted them to be seen.

03:33.420 --> 03:37.920
So when copyright claimants stopped blocking my videos and simply ran ads on them, it was

03:37.920 --> 03:40.380
no skin off my back.

03:40.380 --> 03:44.260
Monetization used to be a rare privilege on YouTube reserved only for the top creators

03:44.260 --> 03:45.400
on the site.

03:45.400 --> 03:50.460
Over time, however, the advent of MCNs made monetization much more accessible, so our

03:50.460 --> 03:54.300
standards and expectations of earning YouTube revenue changed.

03:54.300 --> 03:59.380
Unfortunately, the Content ID system didn't change alongside our expectations.

03:59.380 --> 04:04.780
All of a sudden, monetization became an entitlement rather than a dream, and the once benign revenue

04:04.780 --> 04:08.660
collection from media companies became a much more pervasive issue.

04:08.660 --> 04:13.820
The Content ID system only really improved in its ability to detect content and not in

04:13.820 --> 04:18.860
its ability to differentiate remixes and reviews from shameless re-uploads.

04:18.860 --> 04:22.740
At some points, the media conglomerates were the least of our concern.

04:22.740 --> 04:27.900
People like Derek Savage and Matt Haas began abusing the system to silence criticism.

04:27.900 --> 04:30.860
Fair use was totally thrown by the wayside.

04:30.860 --> 04:35.900
Content creators suffered, while abusive claimants faced no consequences whatsoever.

04:35.900 --> 04:41.100
Even now, ten whole years after the introduction of Content ID, YouTube's copyright system

04:41.100 --> 04:46.680
is still very flawed, with many blatant issues remaining unresolved and unaddressed.

04:46.680 --> 04:51.620
But with that being said, this is the system in place, and YouTubers have had to accept

04:51.620 --> 04:53.780
that this is our reality.

04:53.780 --> 04:59.060
If you want to succeed on YouTube, you must go through the Content ID system, and as the

04:59.060 --> 05:05.540
system has become more advanced, so too have the strategies YouTubers use to outsmart it.

05:05.540 --> 05:09.660
Strategies that essentially answer the question, how much copyrighted stuff can I use and still

05:09.660 --> 05:10.940
get paid?

05:10.940 --> 05:13.740
Using copyrighted content is inherently risky.

05:13.740 --> 05:17.940
The more you use, the more likely you are to lose out on revenue for a video.

05:17.940 --> 05:23.260
However, the more you avoid copyrighted material, the more you risk your content becoming bland,

05:23.260 --> 05:26.300
repetitive, and unengaging for new viewers.

05:26.300 --> 05:30.180
It's a delicate balance, and to this day no one knows for sure the best way to approach

05:30.180 --> 05:35.500
this conundrum, a conundrum I like to call the YouTube copyright metagame.

05:35.500 --> 05:51.620
The metagame can essentially be represented by a spectrum of risk, specifically the risk

05:51.620 --> 05:56.420
of tripping the Content ID system through the use of copyrighted content in your video.

05:56.420 --> 05:59.700
How close can you get to the fire without getting burned?

05:59.700 --> 06:04.140
Starting at the very left of the spectrum, you will find the least risky option possible,

06:04.140 --> 06:13.700
Mr. Clean, the type of content where you don't use any copyrighted material because

06:13.700 --> 06:14.980
you don't need it.

06:14.980 --> 06:18.560
This style used to be much more common in the early days of YouTube, where people would

06:18.560 --> 06:22.100
just flip on a webcam and upload a raw video of themselves talking.

06:22.100 --> 06:26.420
Theoretically, this stuff should be safe from even the most slimy copyright abuse.

06:26.420 --> 06:31.360
It's strictly original by design, and using external copyrighted sources is completely

06:31.360 --> 06:35.640
unnecessary to the purpose of the content, making it the least risky type of video on

06:35.640 --> 06:36.640
the site.

06:36.640 --> 06:40.380
But with that being said, there's a reason why you don't really see this type of video

06:40.380 --> 06:41.720
much anymore.

06:41.720 --> 06:46.500
Nowadays, audiences expect a little more than a raw video of you making a sandwich.

06:46.500 --> 06:50.920
So unless you're very talented, in a very specific niche, or have very high production

06:50.920 --> 06:53.840
value, people aren't really going to be rushing to watch you.

06:53.840 --> 06:59.120
Unlike the old days, most modern genres on YouTube do benefit from using multimedia assets

06:59.120 --> 07:02.080
like external music, images, and footage.

07:02.080 --> 07:05.420
So much so that it's almost a requirement for growing your channel.

07:05.420 --> 07:22.720
But despite this, there are some creators who choose not to do it regardless.

07:22.720 --> 07:27.360
The cold turkey is very similar to Mr. Clean, the only difference being that cold turkeys

07:27.360 --> 07:31.780
abstain from using copyrighted material even though their videos could conceivably benefit

07:31.780 --> 07:32.840
from it.

07:32.840 --> 07:37.980
A big example that comes to mind here is Kurzgesagt, a science channel that painstakingly ensures

07:37.980 --> 07:40.980
that all of their assets are original content.

07:40.980 --> 07:45.280
And although they have successfully eliminated the risk of a copyright dispute, the costs

07:45.280 --> 07:50.440
are enormous, requiring a team of people spending hundreds of hours per video drawing and animating

07:50.440 --> 07:54.320
visual components in addition to composing original music.

07:54.320 --> 07:58.960
Clearly, this tremendous amount of effort is not exactly feasible for smaller channels

07:58.960 --> 08:00.640
who can't spare the expense.

08:00.640 --> 08:05.800
A lot of you have been commenting asking me why I'm no longer playing clips of songs in

08:05.800 --> 08:12.640
my videos, how come I'm not playing the clips, why aren't I playing the clips, and basically

08:12.640 --> 08:16.600
my answer to that question is copyright.

08:16.600 --> 08:20.840
Anthony Fantano is another YouTube creator who seems to avoid using copyrighted material

08:20.840 --> 08:22.560
at all costs.

08:22.600 --> 08:27.600
Why I chose not to use copyrighted material in my reviews despite it being a very common

08:27.600 --> 08:30.840
practice among YouTube reviewers.

08:30.840 --> 08:33.840
It's just really a time-consuming process and something that just ends up being like

08:33.840 --> 08:38.240
a real nail-biter at the end of the day because I'm worried about whether or not this video

08:38.240 --> 08:41.900
is, am I gonna get revenue off of that, am I gonna get revenue off of this, is this going

08:41.900 --> 08:47.460
to affect whether or not the next video is monetized or this, that, and the other thing.

08:47.460 --> 08:50.640
It's just kind of a headache I would rather not focus on because I have to put out so

08:50.640 --> 08:57.920
much content all the time and I feel like just spending all of that time, all of that

08:57.920 --> 09:03.260
effort on just refuting claims and fighting with this label and fighting with that label

09:03.260 --> 09:07.120
and responding to this and responding to that, it's just a waste of my time.

09:07.120 --> 09:11.800
Media criticism is a genre that can benefit greatly from using copyrighted works to provide

09:11.800 --> 09:14.920
the viewer with direct examples of the elements being reviewed.

09:14.920 --> 09:19.840
However, on Fantano's music review channel The Needle Drop, he abstains from using any

09:19.840 --> 09:22.280
song samples within his reviews.

09:22.280 --> 09:26.920
This creates the rather unfortunate consequence of his reviews lacking context for audience

09:26.920 --> 09:29.640
members unfamiliar with the specific work.

09:29.640 --> 09:33.200
This appears to have the effect of making his viewership dependent on the popularity

09:33.200 --> 09:37.680
of the song or album rather than intrinsic to the channel itself.

09:37.680 --> 09:41.880
Fantano has only been able to overcome this because of his unrivaled consistency and longevity

09:41.880 --> 09:43.080
in the medium.

09:43.080 --> 09:47.560
As one of the first regular music reviewers on YouTube, he quickly established himself

09:47.560 --> 09:52.240
as the premier music critic on not just YouTube but the internet in general.

10:17.560 --> 10:31.340
Most YouTubers, however, don't have the benefit of pioneering a genre.

10:31.340 --> 10:36.440
It's difficult to imagine another critic becoming popular doing what Fantano does.

10:36.440 --> 10:40.720
YouTubers must innovate their approaches if they want to avoid getting labeled as a derivative

10:40.720 --> 10:41.720
clone.

10:41.720 --> 10:46.040
And frequently, this innovation requires the use of copyrighted material, which is where

10:46.040 --> 10:49.660
we find the copyright strategist I call the fair users.

10:49.660 --> 10:54.080
This is where you'll find a majority of your film, TV, and video game reviewers in addition

10:54.080 --> 10:57.440
to a lot of drama, news, and commentary channels.

10:57.440 --> 11:01.760
This type of media is dependent on discussing and critiquing someone else's content, whether

11:01.760 --> 11:05.240
it's owned by a movie studio or some other YouTuber.

11:05.240 --> 11:09.640
This content falls under the legal defense of fair use, which theoretically protects

11:09.640 --> 11:11.880
it from claims of copyright infringement.

11:11.880 --> 11:16.280
However, as we've discussed earlier, rights holders on YouTube don't really care about

11:16.280 --> 11:17.480
fair use.

11:17.480 --> 11:22.620
The Content ID system cannot determine the context of the copyrighted material, it can

11:22.620 --> 11:25.160
only detect whether it's used at all.

11:25.160 --> 11:29.960
So technically, according to YouTube's automated systems, there's very little separating a

11:29.960 --> 11:33.480
movie review from a direct upload of that same movie.

11:33.480 --> 11:39.500
Which brings me to the bootleggers.

11:39.500 --> 11:43.580
At the very far right of the spectrum, you'll find the closest thing to an organized crime

11:43.580 --> 11:49.240
syndicate on YouTube, the very people that Content ID is trying to stop, people who literally

11:49.240 --> 11:53.240
upload unedited clips of movies and TV shows.

11:53.240 --> 11:56.420
These guys have been around since the very beginning of the website.

11:56.420 --> 12:00.920
YouTube itself was supposedly created because its founder, Jad Karim, wanted to see a live

12:00.920 --> 12:03.780
TV clip that he couldn't find anywhere else.

12:03.780 --> 12:09.380
The origins of YouTube are rooted in the bootlegger, the faceless silent mavericks of YouTube who

12:09.380 --> 12:13.420
make sure that no epic movie one-liner goes unuploaded.

12:13.420 --> 12:18.020
It was this type of content which instigated the Viacom lawsuit in the first place and

12:18.020 --> 12:21.420
directly led to the implementation of Content ID.

12:21.420 --> 12:26.620
Nowadays, almost every major TV network, movie studio, and record company has their own YouTube

12:26.620 --> 12:28.400
channels to dump clips.

12:28.400 --> 12:32.500
But back in the day, these bootleggers were all we had, and love em or hate em, they were

12:32.500 --> 12:36.300
instrumental in driving traffic to the site when it was just starting out.

12:36.300 --> 12:38.520
And they arguably still are today.

12:38.520 --> 12:43.120
So the next time you see a Family Guy Funny Moments compilation pop into your recommended,

12:43.120 --> 12:46.940
you can be thankful, because no traffic means no YouTube.

12:46.940 --> 12:50.840
And many of you watching now are only here because you were first introduced to the site

12:50.840 --> 12:53.520
by binging unlicensed TV clips.

12:53.520 --> 12:56.640
The bootleggers walked so YouTubers could run.

12:56.640 --> 13:00.120
You don't have to respect them, but you have to acknowledge the role they play on this

13:00.120 --> 13:01.120
site.

13:01.120 --> 13:06.480
But with that being said, they are uploading exclusively copyrighted content, and no, slapping

13:06.480 --> 13:09.720
on a euphoric After Effects intro doesn't change that.

13:09.720 --> 13:13.440
So I can't really feel bad for them when they get caught, considering the copyright

13:13.440 --> 13:16.220
system literally exists to stop them.

13:16.220 --> 13:20.480
So so far we've covered the riskiest copyright strategy, and the safest.

13:20.480 --> 13:22.120
So what about everything in between?

13:22.120 --> 13:27.080
Well, that's the part of the spectrum I affectionately refer to as No Man's Land,

13:27.080 --> 13:28.940
and the place I like to call home.

13:28.940 --> 13:33.440
It just so happens that I and a lot of other YouTubers use copyrighted content just for

13:33.440 --> 13:34.440
the hell of it.

13:34.440 --> 13:38.760
I can't speak for everyone else, but I do it simply because it's a style I've adapted

13:38.760 --> 13:40.900
since my days in YouTube Poop.

13:40.900 --> 13:45.200
Anyone familiar with the history of the genre is aware that we've been terrorized by copyright

13:45.200 --> 13:49.700
claims for ages, dating back to when the system was much less forgiving.

13:49.700 --> 13:54.600
So many channels were barbarically slaughtered for daring to upload videos of SpongeBob shooting

13:54.600 --> 13:55.820
Patrick.

13:55.820 --> 14:00.260
In modern times, meme channels have to deal with a lot of the same pitfalls.

14:00.260 --> 14:06.260
We are a noble and proud people, simply making humorous edits for the enjoyment of others.

14:06.260 --> 14:11.220
Even though the fruits of our labor get shamelessly reposted elsewhere, we never remix our sources

14:11.220 --> 14:12.860
with the same intent.

14:12.860 --> 14:17.100
In terms of our approach to copyright, you can call us the Transformers, because our

14:17.100 --> 14:21.260
work is transformative and supposedly under the protection of fair use.

14:21.260 --> 14:26.260
When a copyrighted work is remixed, altered, or edited, it has theoretically been transformed

14:26.260 --> 14:31.180
beyond the confines of its original purpose and should therefore be treated as an entirely

14:31.180 --> 14:32.360
new entity.

14:32.360 --> 14:36.880
To put it simply, people who want to watch The Incredibles aren't going to tune into

14:36.880 --> 14:40.380
my eight-minute nonsensical remix of The Incredibles.

14:40.380 --> 14:43.580
They're gonna pay for the full-length movie or pirate it.

14:43.580 --> 14:47.760
My remix is not attempting to siphon revenue off the original work.

14:47.760 --> 14:51.500
My viewers are not trying to skirt around paying for a movie ticket.

14:51.500 --> 14:55.420
They're watching to see my artistic interpretation of the source material.

14:55.420 --> 15:00.220
It's the same reason why Andy Warhol's paintings can't be classified as an advertisement for

15:00.220 --> 15:01.500
Campbell's Soup.

15:01.500 --> 15:05.340
He transformed the original work into something completely distinct.

15:05.340 --> 15:10.540
However, in the eyes of the copyright holder on YouTube, it doesn't make much of a difference.

15:10.540 --> 15:15.420
If you use any significant amount of copyrighted footage regardless of the context, you are

15:15.420 --> 15:17.080
likely to get claimed.

15:17.080 --> 15:20.740
And this is largely due to how the Content ID system is administered.

15:20.740 --> 15:27.380
You've reached the Navy's Automated Phone Service.

15:27.380 --> 15:32.660
Earlier this year, YouTube released an alternate version of their Content ID tool for creators

15:32.660 --> 15:34.740
in the YouTube Studio Beta.

15:34.740 --> 15:39.580
While it does not grant creators the same revenue-sharing privileges as media companies,

15:39.580 --> 15:44.300
it does provide us with insight on what these companies see while claiming our content.

15:44.300 --> 15:48.460
Basically, within the Copyright tab, you'll see a list of other people's videos that the

15:48.460 --> 15:51.420
system detected to match content in your videos.

15:51.420 --> 15:55.420
Presumably, media companies have the additional option to claim revenue from each video on

15:55.420 --> 15:59.780
the list regardless of the context, amount used, or whether the claimant even watched

15:59.780 --> 16:00.960
the video.

16:00.960 --> 16:05.060
This highly streamlined system is great for rights holders and terrible for pretty much

16:05.060 --> 16:06.060
everyone else.

16:06.060 --> 16:10.160
Essentially, there's nothing stopping media companies from just spamming revenue claims

16:10.160 --> 16:13.620
on every video that winds up on the content claims list.

16:13.620 --> 16:18.300
Theoretically, YouTubers are supposed to have a means of countering bogus claims in accordance

16:18.300 --> 16:22.640
with the DMCA, but in practice, that simply isn't the case.

16:22.640 --> 16:28.560
On YouTube, the claimant presides as the judge, jury, and executioner in copyright disputes.

16:28.560 --> 16:32.480
Appeals and counterclaims mean nothing when their outcome is determined by the same people

16:32.480 --> 16:35.460
who issued the claim in the first place.

16:35.460 --> 16:40.100
Once the copyright holder inevitably rejects all of your appeals, your only option to reverse

16:40.100 --> 16:43.220
the claim is to literally take the claimant to court.

16:43.220 --> 16:48.300
Basically all YouTubers are just small, private citizens who can't afford to fight multi-million

16:48.300 --> 16:51.080
dollar corporations in a lengthy court battle.

16:51.080 --> 16:56.100
In a legal war of attrition, the corporation will always win, and when you factor in how

16:56.100 --> 17:01.020
the cost of even entering a lawsuit will greatly exceed any revenue you would gain from the

17:01.020 --> 17:05.200
video, this makes legal action a non-existent option in practice.

17:05.200 --> 17:09.680
In the world of YouTube copyright, the claimant holds all of the leverage.

17:09.680 --> 17:14.280
The way YouTube sees it, they earn the same cut of revenue no matter who claims the video,

17:14.280 --> 17:17.620
so they don't exactly have much of an incentive to change this.

17:17.620 --> 17:21.400
Imagine if your ex-wife was in charge of determining your alimony payment.

17:21.400 --> 17:23.400
Doesn't really seem fair, does it?

17:23.400 --> 17:27.500
Well, that's the system we have on YouTube, and I've personally had to deal with it

17:27.500 --> 17:29.440
time and time again.

17:29.440 --> 17:34.900
Episode 2 of Never Ever had its revenue claimed by WWE for using less than a minute of content.

17:34.900 --> 17:39.560
I was discouraged, but I was actually willing to settle for this because I was done worrying

17:39.560 --> 17:43.240
about it and I just wanted the video to go online for people to see.

17:43.240 --> 17:50.280
Then, a few hours after making it public, WWE blocked the video worldwide.

17:50.280 --> 17:56.680
So in review, I uploaded a video basically giving WWE free praise, free promotion, and

17:56.680 --> 17:59.320
free revenue, and they took a look at that and said,

17:59.320 --> 18:01.680
Duh, no, we don't want any of that.

18:01.680 --> 18:08.680
We're gonna instead choose to be as belligerent as possible to assert our copyright dominance.

18:08.680 --> 18:13.480
My appeal was, predictably, rejected, leaving me with no choice but to re-cut the parts

18:13.480 --> 18:15.560
and re-upload the entire video.

18:15.560 --> 18:19.800
And hey, this time, the Content ID system didn't detect anything, and I gotta keep

18:19.800 --> 18:21.800
all the revenue for myself.

18:21.800 --> 18:27.580
So in conclusion, WWE can suck a fart out of my ass, your programming is hot garbage,

18:27.580 --> 18:33.040
and I can't wait to start watching AEW this fall, Wednesdays on TNT, and let this serve

18:33.040 --> 18:37.600
as a permanent reminder to all of you that media companies don't care one bit about

18:37.600 --> 18:39.400
the context of your video.

18:39.400 --> 18:44.880
They will shut you down, without warning, for no reason, even if your video benefits

18:44.880 --> 18:47.080
them in every conceivable way.

18:47.080 --> 18:51.520
So if you think that these media companies are willing to spare a single minute of time

18:51.520 --> 18:57.720
to give your video a fair review, then you are sorely mistaken on how little these companies

18:57.720 --> 18:58.720
care.

18:58.720 --> 19:02.520
If you want your videos to get through the copyright system unscathed, you can't rely

19:02.520 --> 19:05.240
on media companies to be nice.

19:05.240 --> 19:09.320
Often times, the people in charge of manually reviewing the claims seem more robotic than

19:09.320 --> 19:11.620
the automated system itself.

19:11.620 --> 19:16.320
So with that being said, the discretion of the copyright system depends almost entirely

19:16.320 --> 19:19.640
on whether or not you can sneak past the bot undetected.

19:19.640 --> 19:24.000
And in order to do that, we're going to have to investigate the dark arts of copyright

19:24.000 --> 19:25.000
smuggling.

19:25.000 --> 19:29.800
Coming up in part 2 of YouTube Copyright School, we take a look at the techniques YouTubers

19:29.800 --> 19:31.680
use to avoid getting claimed.

19:31.680 --> 19:38.300
She's a defense!

19:38.300 --> 19:44.040
People of society, it is I, Joker Emp, here to tell you that enough is enough.

19:44.040 --> 19:49.020
I have had it with getting copyright claimed, getting demonetized, getting pushed around

19:49.020 --> 19:51.960
by this cruel, unfeeling world.

19:51.960 --> 19:56.400
Society has stolen my precious ad revenue for long enough, and I figure it's about time

19:56.400 --> 19:57.640
I return the favor.

19:57.640 --> 20:02.400
Now don't you bother touching that dial, because I'm currently broadcasting live around the

20:02.400 --> 20:03.400
world.

20:03.400 --> 20:07.560
That's right, ladies and gentlemen, I've successfully hacked into all of your machines using the

20:07.560 --> 20:09.720
power of the downward spiral.

20:09.720 --> 20:14.040
And now, you're all about to witness what happens when YouTubers rise up.

20:14.040 --> 20:18.440
If you're seeing this message, then your personal information has already been harvested and

20:18.440 --> 20:20.240
sold to the Chinese.

20:20.240 --> 20:24.560
And I got away with it too, all because you people connected to public Wi-Fi without a

20:24.560 --> 20:25.880
VPN.

20:25.880 --> 20:30.400
All those times I tried to sell you NordVPN, you scoffed and clicked away.

20:30.400 --> 20:32.280
Well, guess what, you fools?

20:32.280 --> 20:36.920
You should have used my affiliate link to purchase NordVPN for 70% off the three-year

20:36.920 --> 20:40.440
plan, because now, you're all gonna pay.

20:40.440 --> 20:41.440
Bahaha!

20:41.440 --> 20:44.440
Who's demonetized now?

20:55.880 --> 21:09.400
You can leave and be coughing though if you want, that's your choice I suppose.
