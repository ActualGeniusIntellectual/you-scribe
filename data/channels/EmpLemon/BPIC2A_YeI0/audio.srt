1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,540
You pop this piece of crap in and what do you get?

2
00:00:03,540 --> 00:00:10,300
There is an enormous problem right now with people and corporations in the music industry

3
00:00:10,300 --> 00:00:17,980
that are unlawfully and religiously claiming works that were made fully legally by YouTube

4
00:00:17,980 --> 00:00:18,980
channels.

5
00:00:18,980 --> 00:00:23,940
Where I got a mail from YouTube saying that someone named Ram just claimed my video, which

6
00:00:23,940 --> 00:00:28,280
means that the video is still running but the revenue from advertising now goes into

7
00:00:28,280 --> 00:00:30,960
his pocket instead of my pocket.

8
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:37,840
They have copyright claimed just over 400 of my total catalogue of videos.

9
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:41,600
This is two separate claims coming from two different companies.

10
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:45,440
This is clearly an attempt to censor the video from multiple angles.

11
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:46,440
It's premeditated.

12
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:49,640
And it's really nothing but pure censorship.

13
00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:50,640
Hush.

14
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:53,640
Let me go with you.

15
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:59,200
Good lord, what is happening in there?

16
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:02,120
I mean, I know you're a sophisticated guy.

17
00:01:02,120 --> 00:01:03,120
The world is a mess.

18
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:04,120
The world is as angry as it gets.

19
00:01:04,120 --> 00:01:15,140
When you think this is going to cause a little more anger, the world is an angry place.

20
00:01:15,140 --> 00:01:19,440
If you're searching for evidence that we live in a clown-based society, look no further

21
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:21,680
than YouTube's copyright system.

22
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:25,240
Last year I posted an episode of YouTube Geographic where I talked about the origin

23
00:01:25,240 --> 00:01:28,120
and development of YouTube's Content ID system.

24
00:01:28,120 --> 00:01:32,720
I ended the episode with the implication that the copyright system improved over time.

25
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:35,320
But is that actually true or just wishful thinking?

26
00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:40,720
Well, if you compare now with 2008, the system certainly seems better, as nowadays you're

27
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:45,380
far less likely to get your channel striked and terminated as part of a copyright claim.

28
00:01:45,380 --> 00:01:49,400
But I'm not sure whether to attribute this to the system improving or copyright claimants

29
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:50,400
getting smarter.

30
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:55,680
You see, in the beginning when YouTube was just a sketchy, wild west site, media companies

31
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:57,680
wanted nothing to do with it.

32
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:03,220
Many companies like Viacom threatened YouTube with lawsuit after lawsuit for copyright infringement.

33
00:02:03,220 --> 00:02:08,440
When YouTube finally appeased the media companies with Content ID, their only means of controlling

34
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:11,120
the content was a scorched earth policy.

35
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:17,280
2008 to 2009 was probably the worst ever time to upload copyrighted content to YouTube.

36
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:22,020
Any channel at this time uploading montages, remixes, or YouTube poops faced serious risk

37
00:02:22,020 --> 00:02:24,720
of losing everything one day out of the blue.

38
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:29,560
Minor use of copyrighted music frequently resulted in entire videos getting muted or

39
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:33,840
worse, replaced with a dreaded YouTube audio swap song.

40
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:35,840
Stop!

41
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:47,560
Some time later, copyright punishments got a little less severe.

42
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:52,340
Around 2010, media companies began blocking content rather than removing it.

43
00:02:52,340 --> 00:02:56,720
Still a major obstacle for YouTubers, but at least it was preferable to the nuclear

44
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:57,960
option.

45
00:02:57,960 --> 00:03:02,420
Also around this time, Google introduced their AdSense program to YouTube videos, meaning

46
00:03:02,460 --> 00:03:07,980
it was now possible to earn money from content on YouTube, and thus, a new form of copyright

47
00:03:07,980 --> 00:03:10,900
claim became available to rights holders.

48
00:03:10,900 --> 00:03:12,820
Revenue collection.

49
00:03:12,820 --> 00:03:18,240
Eventually, media companies began to realize that monetizing claimed content was a much

50
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:22,700
better option than just removing it, since they could basically generate free revenue

51
00:03:22,700 --> 00:03:25,420
from virtually no effort on their part.

52
00:03:25,420 --> 00:03:29,140
At first this was a very welcome change, at least in my experience.

53
00:03:29,140 --> 00:03:33,420
I wasn't making money from my YouTube poops anyway, I just wanted them to be seen.

54
00:03:33,420 --> 00:03:37,920
So when copyright claimants stopped blocking my videos and simply ran ads on them, it was

55
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:40,380
no skin off my back.

56
00:03:40,380 --> 00:03:44,260
Monetization used to be a rare privilege on YouTube reserved only for the top creators

57
00:03:44,260 --> 00:03:45,400
on the site.

58
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:50,460
Over time, however, the advent of MCNs made monetization much more accessible, so our

59
00:03:50,460 --> 00:03:54,300
standards and expectations of earning YouTube revenue changed.

60
00:03:54,300 --> 00:03:59,380
Unfortunately, the Content ID system didn't change alongside our expectations.

61
00:03:59,380 --> 00:04:04,780
All of a sudden, monetization became an entitlement rather than a dream, and the once benign revenue

62
00:04:04,780 --> 00:04:08,660
collection from media companies became a much more pervasive issue.

63
00:04:08,660 --> 00:04:13,820
The Content ID system only really improved in its ability to detect content and not in

64
00:04:13,820 --> 00:04:18,860
its ability to differentiate remixes and reviews from shameless re-uploads.

65
00:04:18,860 --> 00:04:22,740
At some points, the media conglomerates were the least of our concern.

66
00:04:22,740 --> 00:04:27,900
People like Derek Savage and Matt Haas began abusing the system to silence criticism.

67
00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:30,860
Fair use was totally thrown by the wayside.

68
00:04:30,860 --> 00:04:35,900
Content creators suffered, while abusive claimants faced no consequences whatsoever.

69
00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:41,100
Even now, ten whole years after the introduction of Content ID, YouTube's copyright system

70
00:04:41,100 --> 00:04:46,680
is still very flawed, with many blatant issues remaining unresolved and unaddressed.

71
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:51,620
But with that being said, this is the system in place, and YouTubers have had to accept

72
00:04:51,620 --> 00:04:53,780
that this is our reality.

73
00:04:53,780 --> 00:04:59,060
If you want to succeed on YouTube, you must go through the Content ID system, and as the

74
00:04:59,060 --> 00:05:05,540
system has become more advanced, so too have the strategies YouTubers use to outsmart it.

75
00:05:05,540 --> 00:05:09,660
Strategies that essentially answer the question, how much copyrighted stuff can I use and still

76
00:05:09,660 --> 00:05:10,940
get paid?

77
00:05:10,940 --> 00:05:13,740
Using copyrighted content is inherently risky.

78
00:05:13,740 --> 00:05:17,940
The more you use, the more likely you are to lose out on revenue for a video.

79
00:05:17,940 --> 00:05:23,260
However, the more you avoid copyrighted material, the more you risk your content becoming bland,

80
00:05:23,260 --> 00:05:26,300
repetitive, and unengaging for new viewers.

81
00:05:26,300 --> 00:05:30,180
It's a delicate balance, and to this day no one knows for sure the best way to approach

82
00:05:30,180 --> 00:05:35,500
this conundrum, a conundrum I like to call the YouTube copyright metagame.

83
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:51,620
The metagame can essentially be represented by a spectrum of risk, specifically the risk

84
00:05:51,620 --> 00:05:56,420
of tripping the Content ID system through the use of copyrighted content in your video.

85
00:05:56,420 --> 00:05:59,700
How close can you get to the fire without getting burned?

86
00:05:59,700 --> 00:06:04,140
Starting at the very left of the spectrum, you will find the least risky option possible,

87
00:06:04,140 --> 00:06:13,700
Mr. Clean, the type of content where you don't use any copyrighted material because

88
00:06:13,700 --> 00:06:14,980
you don't need it.

89
00:06:14,980 --> 00:06:18,560
This style used to be much more common in the early days of YouTube, where people would

90
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:22,100
just flip on a webcam and upload a raw video of themselves talking.

91
00:06:22,100 --> 00:06:26,420
Theoretically, this stuff should be safe from even the most slimy copyright abuse.

92
00:06:26,420 --> 00:06:31,360
It's strictly original by design, and using external copyrighted sources is completely

93
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:35,640
unnecessary to the purpose of the content, making it the least risky type of video on

94
00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:36,640
the site.

95
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:40,380
But with that being said, there's a reason why you don't really see this type of video

96
00:06:40,380 --> 00:06:41,720
much anymore.

97
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:46,500
Nowadays, audiences expect a little more than a raw video of you making a sandwich.

98
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:50,920
So unless you're very talented, in a very specific niche, or have very high production

99
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:53,840
value, people aren't really going to be rushing to watch you.

100
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:59,120
Unlike the old days, most modern genres on YouTube do benefit from using multimedia assets

101
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:02,080
like external music, images, and footage.

102
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:05,420
So much so that it's almost a requirement for growing your channel.

103
00:07:05,420 --> 00:07:22,720
But despite this, there are some creators who choose not to do it regardless.

104
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:27,360
The cold turkey is very similar to Mr. Clean, the only difference being that cold turkeys

105
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:31,780
abstain from using copyrighted material even though their videos could conceivably benefit

106
00:07:31,780 --> 00:07:32,840
from it.

107
00:07:32,840 --> 00:07:37,980
A big example that comes to mind here is Kurzgesagt, a science channel that painstakingly ensures

108
00:07:37,980 --> 00:07:40,980
that all of their assets are original content.

109
00:07:40,980 --> 00:07:45,280
And although they have successfully eliminated the risk of a copyright dispute, the costs

110
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:50,440
are enormous, requiring a team of people spending hundreds of hours per video drawing and animating

111
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:54,320
visual components in addition to composing original music.

112
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:58,960
Clearly, this tremendous amount of effort is not exactly feasible for smaller channels

113
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:00,640
who can't spare the expense.

114
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:05,800
A lot of you have been commenting asking me why I'm no longer playing clips of songs in

115
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:12,640
my videos, how come I'm not playing the clips, why aren't I playing the clips, and basically

116
00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:16,600
my answer to that question is copyright.

117
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:20,840
Anthony Fantano is another YouTube creator who seems to avoid using copyrighted material

118
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:22,560
at all costs.

119
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:27,600
Why I chose not to use copyrighted material in my reviews despite it being a very common

120
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:30,840
practice among YouTube reviewers.

121
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:33,840
It's just really a time-consuming process and something that just ends up being like

122
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:38,240
a real nail-biter at the end of the day because I'm worried about whether or not this video

123
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:41,900
is, am I gonna get revenue off of that, am I gonna get revenue off of this, is this going

124
00:08:41,900 --> 00:08:47,460
to affect whether or not the next video is monetized or this, that, and the other thing.

125
00:08:47,460 --> 00:08:50,640
It's just kind of a headache I would rather not focus on because I have to put out so

126
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:57,920
much content all the time and I feel like just spending all of that time, all of that

127
00:08:57,920 --> 00:09:03,260
effort on just refuting claims and fighting with this label and fighting with that label

128
00:09:03,260 --> 00:09:07,120
and responding to this and responding to that, it's just a waste of my time.

129
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:11,800
Media criticism is a genre that can benefit greatly from using copyrighted works to provide

130
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:14,920
the viewer with direct examples of the elements being reviewed.

131
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:19,840
However, on Fantano's music review channel The Needle Drop, he abstains from using any

132
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:22,280
song samples within his reviews.

133
00:09:22,280 --> 00:09:26,920
This creates the rather unfortunate consequence of his reviews lacking context for audience

134
00:09:26,920 --> 00:09:29,640
members unfamiliar with the specific work.

135
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:33,200
This appears to have the effect of making his viewership dependent on the popularity

136
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:37,680
of the song or album rather than intrinsic to the channel itself.

137
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:41,880
Fantano has only been able to overcome this because of his unrivaled consistency and longevity

138
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:43,080
in the medium.

139
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:47,560
As one of the first regular music reviewers on YouTube, he quickly established himself

140
00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:52,240
as the premier music critic on not just YouTube but the internet in general.

141
00:10:17,560 --> 00:10:31,340
Most YouTubers, however, don't have the benefit of pioneering a genre.

142
00:10:31,340 --> 00:10:36,440
It's difficult to imagine another critic becoming popular doing what Fantano does.

143
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:40,720
YouTubers must innovate their approaches if they want to avoid getting labeled as a derivative

144
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:41,720
clone.

145
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:46,040
And frequently, this innovation requires the use of copyrighted material, which is where

146
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:49,660
we find the copyright strategist I call the fair users.

147
00:10:49,660 --> 00:10:54,080
This is where you'll find a majority of your film, TV, and video game reviewers in addition

148
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:57,440
to a lot of drama, news, and commentary channels.

149
00:10:57,440 --> 00:11:01,760
This type of media is dependent on discussing and critiquing someone else's content, whether

150
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:05,240
it's owned by a movie studio or some other YouTuber.

151
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:09,640
This content falls under the legal defense of fair use, which theoretically protects

152
00:11:09,640 --> 00:11:11,880
it from claims of copyright infringement.

153
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:16,280
However, as we've discussed earlier, rights holders on YouTube don't really care about

154
00:11:16,280 --> 00:11:17,480
fair use.

155
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:22,620
The Content ID system cannot determine the context of the copyrighted material, it can

156
00:11:22,620 --> 00:11:25,160
only detect whether it's used at all.

157
00:11:25,160 --> 00:11:29,960
So technically, according to YouTube's automated systems, there's very little separating a

158
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:33,480
movie review from a direct upload of that same movie.

159
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:39,500
Which brings me to the bootleggers.

160
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:43,580
At the very far right of the spectrum, you'll find the closest thing to an organized crime

161
00:11:43,580 --> 00:11:49,240
syndicate on YouTube, the very people that Content ID is trying to stop, people who literally

162
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:53,240
upload unedited clips of movies and TV shows.

163
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:56,420
These guys have been around since the very beginning of the website.

164
00:11:56,420 --> 00:12:00,920
YouTube itself was supposedly created because its founder, Jad Karim, wanted to see a live

165
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:03,780
TV clip that he couldn't find anywhere else.

166
00:12:03,780 --> 00:12:09,380
The origins of YouTube are rooted in the bootlegger, the faceless silent mavericks of YouTube who

167
00:12:09,380 --> 00:12:13,420
make sure that no epic movie one-liner goes unuploaded.

168
00:12:13,420 --> 00:12:18,020
It was this type of content which instigated the Viacom lawsuit in the first place and

169
00:12:18,020 --> 00:12:21,420
directly led to the implementation of Content ID.

170
00:12:21,420 --> 00:12:26,620
Nowadays, almost every major TV network, movie studio, and record company has their own YouTube

171
00:12:26,620 --> 00:12:28,400
channels to dump clips.

172
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:32,500
But back in the day, these bootleggers were all we had, and love em or hate em, they were

173
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:36,300
instrumental in driving traffic to the site when it was just starting out.

174
00:12:36,300 --> 00:12:38,520
And they arguably still are today.

175
00:12:38,520 --> 00:12:43,120
So the next time you see a Family Guy Funny Moments compilation pop into your recommended,

176
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:46,940
you can be thankful, because no traffic means no YouTube.

177
00:12:46,940 --> 00:12:50,840
And many of you watching now are only here because you were first introduced to the site

178
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:53,520
by binging unlicensed TV clips.

179
00:12:53,520 --> 00:12:56,640
The bootleggers walked so YouTubers could run.

180
00:12:56,640 --> 00:13:00,120
You don't have to respect them, but you have to acknowledge the role they play on this

181
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:01,120
site.

182
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:06,480
But with that being said, they are uploading exclusively copyrighted content, and no, slapping

183
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:09,720
on a euphoric After Effects intro doesn't change that.

184
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:13,440
So I can't really feel bad for them when they get caught, considering the copyright

185
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:16,220
system literally exists to stop them.

186
00:13:16,220 --> 00:13:20,480
So so far we've covered the riskiest copyright strategy, and the safest.

187
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:22,120
So what about everything in between?

188
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:27,080
Well, that's the part of the spectrum I affectionately refer to as No Man's Land,

189
00:13:27,080 --> 00:13:28,940
and the place I like to call home.

190
00:13:28,940 --> 00:13:33,440
It just so happens that I and a lot of other YouTubers use copyrighted content just for

191
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:34,440
the hell of it.

192
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:38,760
I can't speak for everyone else, but I do it simply because it's a style I've adapted

193
00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:40,900
since my days in YouTube Poop.

194
00:13:40,900 --> 00:13:45,200
Anyone familiar with the history of the genre is aware that we've been terrorized by copyright

195
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:49,700
claims for ages, dating back to when the system was much less forgiving.

196
00:13:49,700 --> 00:13:54,600
So many channels were barbarically slaughtered for daring to upload videos of SpongeBob shooting

197
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:55,820
Patrick.

198
00:13:55,820 --> 00:14:00,260
In modern times, meme channels have to deal with a lot of the same pitfalls.

199
00:14:00,260 --> 00:14:06,260
We are a noble and proud people, simply making humorous edits for the enjoyment of others.

200
00:14:06,260 --> 00:14:11,220
Even though the fruits of our labor get shamelessly reposted elsewhere, we never remix our sources

201
00:14:11,220 --> 00:14:12,860
with the same intent.

202
00:14:12,860 --> 00:14:17,100
In terms of our approach to copyright, you can call us the Transformers, because our

203
00:14:17,100 --> 00:14:21,260
work is transformative and supposedly under the protection of fair use.

204
00:14:21,260 --> 00:14:26,260
When a copyrighted work is remixed, altered, or edited, it has theoretically been transformed

205
00:14:26,260 --> 00:14:31,180
beyond the confines of its original purpose and should therefore be treated as an entirely

206
00:14:31,180 --> 00:14:32,360
new entity.

207
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:36,880
To put it simply, people who want to watch The Incredibles aren't going to tune into

208
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:40,380
my eight-minute nonsensical remix of The Incredibles.

209
00:14:40,380 --> 00:14:43,580
They're gonna pay for the full-length movie or pirate it.

210
00:14:43,580 --> 00:14:47,760
My remix is not attempting to siphon revenue off the original work.

211
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:51,500
My viewers are not trying to skirt around paying for a movie ticket.

212
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:55,420
They're watching to see my artistic interpretation of the source material.

213
00:14:55,420 --> 00:15:00,220
It's the same reason why Andy Warhol's paintings can't be classified as an advertisement for

214
00:15:00,220 --> 00:15:01,500
Campbell's Soup.

215
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:05,340
He transformed the original work into something completely distinct.

216
00:15:05,340 --> 00:15:10,540
However, in the eyes of the copyright holder on YouTube, it doesn't make much of a difference.

217
00:15:10,540 --> 00:15:15,420
If you use any significant amount of copyrighted footage regardless of the context, you are

218
00:15:15,420 --> 00:15:17,080
likely to get claimed.

219
00:15:17,080 --> 00:15:20,740
And this is largely due to how the Content ID system is administered.

220
00:15:20,740 --> 00:15:27,380
You've reached the Navy's Automated Phone Service.

221
00:15:27,380 --> 00:15:32,660
Earlier this year, YouTube released an alternate version of their Content ID tool for creators

222
00:15:32,660 --> 00:15:34,740
in the YouTube Studio Beta.

223
00:15:34,740 --> 00:15:39,580
While it does not grant creators the same revenue-sharing privileges as media companies,

224
00:15:39,580 --> 00:15:44,300
it does provide us with insight on what these companies see while claiming our content.

225
00:15:44,300 --> 00:15:48,460
Basically, within the Copyright tab, you'll see a list of other people's videos that the

226
00:15:48,460 --> 00:15:51,420
system detected to match content in your videos.

227
00:15:51,420 --> 00:15:55,420
Presumably, media companies have the additional option to claim revenue from each video on

228
00:15:55,420 --> 00:15:59,780
the list regardless of the context, amount used, or whether the claimant even watched

229
00:15:59,780 --> 00:16:00,960
the video.

230
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:05,060
This highly streamlined system is great for rights holders and terrible for pretty much

231
00:16:05,060 --> 00:16:06,060
everyone else.

232
00:16:06,060 --> 00:16:10,160
Essentially, there's nothing stopping media companies from just spamming revenue claims

233
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:13,620
on every video that winds up on the content claims list.

234
00:16:13,620 --> 00:16:18,300
Theoretically, YouTubers are supposed to have a means of countering bogus claims in accordance

235
00:16:18,300 --> 00:16:22,640
with the DMCA, but in practice, that simply isn't the case.

236
00:16:22,640 --> 00:16:28,560
On YouTube, the claimant presides as the judge, jury, and executioner in copyright disputes.

237
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:32,480
Appeals and counterclaims mean nothing when their outcome is determined by the same people

238
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:35,460
who issued the claim in the first place.

239
00:16:35,460 --> 00:16:40,100
Once the copyright holder inevitably rejects all of your appeals, your only option to reverse

240
00:16:40,100 --> 00:16:43,220
the claim is to literally take the claimant to court.

241
00:16:43,220 --> 00:16:48,300
Basically all YouTubers are just small, private citizens who can't afford to fight multi-million

242
00:16:48,300 --> 00:16:51,080
dollar corporations in a lengthy court battle.

243
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:56,100
In a legal war of attrition, the corporation will always win, and when you factor in how

244
00:16:56,100 --> 00:17:01,020
the cost of even entering a lawsuit will greatly exceed any revenue you would gain from the

245
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:05,200
video, this makes legal action a non-existent option in practice.

246
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:09,680
In the world of YouTube copyright, the claimant holds all of the leverage.

247
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:14,280
The way YouTube sees it, they earn the same cut of revenue no matter who claims the video,

248
00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:17,620
so they don't exactly have much of an incentive to change this.

249
00:17:17,620 --> 00:17:21,400
Imagine if your ex-wife was in charge of determining your alimony payment.

250
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:23,400
Doesn't really seem fair, does it?

251
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:27,500
Well, that's the system we have on YouTube, and I've personally had to deal with it

252
00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:29,440
time and time again.

253
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:34,900
Episode 2 of Never Ever had its revenue claimed by WWE for using less than a minute of content.

254
00:17:34,900 --> 00:17:39,560
I was discouraged, but I was actually willing to settle for this because I was done worrying

255
00:17:39,560 --> 00:17:43,240
about it and I just wanted the video to go online for people to see.

256
00:17:43,240 --> 00:17:50,280
Then, a few hours after making it public, WWE blocked the video worldwide.

257
00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:56,680
So in review, I uploaded a video basically giving WWE free praise, free promotion, and

258
00:17:56,680 --> 00:17:59,320
free revenue, and they took a look at that and said,

259
00:17:59,320 --> 00:18:01,680
Duh, no, we don't want any of that.

260
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:08,680
We're gonna instead choose to be as belligerent as possible to assert our copyright dominance.

261
00:18:08,680 --> 00:18:13,480
My appeal was, predictably, rejected, leaving me with no choice but to re-cut the parts

262
00:18:13,480 --> 00:18:15,560
and re-upload the entire video.

263
00:18:15,560 --> 00:18:19,800
And hey, this time, the Content ID system didn't detect anything, and I gotta keep

264
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:21,800
all the revenue for myself.

265
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:27,580
So in conclusion, WWE can suck a fart out of my ass, your programming is hot garbage,

266
00:18:27,580 --> 00:18:33,040
and I can't wait to start watching AEW this fall, Wednesdays on TNT, and let this serve

267
00:18:33,040 --> 00:18:37,600
as a permanent reminder to all of you that media companies don't care one bit about

268
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:39,400
the context of your video.

269
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:44,880
They will shut you down, without warning, for no reason, even if your video benefits

270
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:47,080
them in every conceivable way.

271
00:18:47,080 --> 00:18:51,520
So if you think that these media companies are willing to spare a single minute of time

272
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:57,720
to give your video a fair review, then you are sorely mistaken on how little these companies

273
00:18:57,720 --> 00:18:58,720
care.

274
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:02,520
If you want your videos to get through the copyright system unscathed, you can't rely

275
00:19:02,520 --> 00:19:05,240
on media companies to be nice.

276
00:19:05,240 --> 00:19:09,320
Often times, the people in charge of manually reviewing the claims seem more robotic than

277
00:19:09,320 --> 00:19:11,620
the automated system itself.

278
00:19:11,620 --> 00:19:16,320
So with that being said, the discretion of the copyright system depends almost entirely

279
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:19,640
on whether or not you can sneak past the bot undetected.

280
00:19:19,640 --> 00:19:24,000
And in order to do that, we're going to have to investigate the dark arts of copyright

281
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,000
smuggling.

282
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:29,800
Coming up in part 2 of YouTube Copyright School, we take a look at the techniques YouTubers

283
00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:31,680
use to avoid getting claimed.

284
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:38,300
She's a defense!

285
00:19:38,300 --> 00:19:44,040
People of society, it is I, Joker Emp, here to tell you that enough is enough.

286
00:19:44,040 --> 00:19:49,020
I have had it with getting copyright claimed, getting demonetized, getting pushed around

287
00:19:49,020 --> 00:19:51,960
by this cruel, unfeeling world.

288
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:56,400
Society has stolen my precious ad revenue for long enough, and I figure it's about time

289
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:57,640
I return the favor.

290
00:19:57,640 --> 00:20:02,400
Now don't you bother touching that dial, because I'm currently broadcasting live around the

291
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:03,400
world.

292
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:07,560
That's right, ladies and gentlemen, I've successfully hacked into all of your machines using the

293
00:20:07,560 --> 00:20:09,720
power of the downward spiral.

294
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:14,040
And now, you're all about to witness what happens when YouTubers rise up.

295
00:20:14,040 --> 00:20:18,440
If you're seeing this message, then your personal information has already been harvested and

296
00:20:18,440 --> 00:20:20,240
sold to the Chinese.

297
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:24,560
And I got away with it too, all because you people connected to public Wi-Fi without a

298
00:20:24,560 --> 00:20:25,880
VPN.

299
00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:30,400
All those times I tried to sell you NordVPN, you scoffed and clicked away.

300
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:32,280
Well, guess what, you fools?

301
00:20:32,280 --> 00:20:36,920
You should have used my affiliate link to purchase NordVPN for 70% off the three-year

302
00:20:36,920 --> 00:20:40,440
plan, because now, you're all gonna pay.

303
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:41,440
Bahaha!

304
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:44,440
Who's demonetized now?

305
00:20:55,880 --> 00:21:09,400
You can leave and be coughing though if you want, that's your choice I suppose.
