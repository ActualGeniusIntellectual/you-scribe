00:00.000 --> 00:03.400
You know, I wasn't even gonna make a video about the Logan Paul controversy,

00:03.400 --> 00:10.000
but YouTube's sheer amount of ape-like incompetence in handling the situation just forced my hand.

00:10.000 --> 00:14.400
Now let me preface this rant by saying that this is not a Logan Paul video.

00:14.400 --> 00:18.000
I don't give a shit about the Paul brothers and their wacky hijinks.

00:18.000 --> 00:22.000
And if you keep giving them the attention they want, then you're part of the problem.

00:22.000 --> 00:24.200
This is a video about YouTube.

00:24.200 --> 00:28.200
Oh, mercy me. YouTube, YouTube, YouTube.

00:28.200 --> 00:33.000
How on earth is the number two website on the internet this incompetent?

00:33.000 --> 00:34.200
Nine days.

00:34.200 --> 00:39.600
It took them nine days to respond to the biggest PR disaster they've had since,

00:39.600 --> 00:42.600
well, basically everything that happened last year.

00:42.600 --> 00:47.800
But holy Christ, you'd think that considering everything that happened last year,

00:47.800 --> 00:53.000
YouTube would learn a thing or two about running a company without causing everyone to hate them.

00:53.000 --> 00:56.600
But no, apparently YouTube has learned absolutely nothing

00:56.600 --> 01:01.800
and could not last one day in 2018 without screwing up yet again.

01:01.800 --> 01:06.000
Everyone knows the story already, but for argument's sake, let's review what happened.

01:06.000 --> 01:12.800
So old foot-face Logan Paul broke YouTube's guidelines by uploading footage of an actual corpse.

01:12.800 --> 01:15.600
But since the Paul brothers are YouTube's golden boys,

01:15.600 --> 01:21.600
YouTube chose not to enforce their rules and actually hand-picked the video for their trending page.

01:21.600 --> 01:29.400
They allow this content on trending while simultaneously demonetizing regular users' content at record proportions.

01:29.400 --> 01:34.700
They allow this content on trending just a month after the concerns of child endangerment

01:34.700 --> 01:38.800
forced YouTube to scramble and try and save their image for advertisers.

01:38.800 --> 01:46.300
YouTube kept this video trending while taking down other users' videos pointing out YouTube's unscrupulous hypocrisy.

01:46.300 --> 01:52.800
YouTube allowed this video to stay online for over two days before Logan Paul himself took it down,

01:52.800 --> 01:57.900
only after receiving the biggest backlash against a single YouTuber I've ever witnessed.

01:57.900 --> 02:01.300
Logan Paul was the number one Twitter trend for about a day straight.

02:01.300 --> 02:07.100
Pretty much every big YouTuber from across the board came out expressing how terrible Logan's video was.

02:07.100 --> 02:12.800
The video was picked up by the biggest news outlets and Logan Paul became a global embarrassment.

02:12.800 --> 02:17.400
And YouTube did or said nothing about it for more than a week.

02:17.400 --> 02:21.400
So just when everyone had moved on to Ugandan Knuckles or whatever,

02:21.400 --> 02:23.400
YouTube finally comes out and says,

02:23.400 --> 02:26.200
Oh, okay guys, y'all are right.

02:26.200 --> 02:30.500
Logan Paul did a bad thing and now we're gonna put him in timeout.

02:30.500 --> 02:32.400
Nine days after it happened.

02:32.400 --> 02:36.800
Now, I don't know if YouTube receives their news by horseback,

02:36.800 --> 02:39.700
but considering they're a website on the internet,

02:39.700 --> 02:46.300
one could infer that YouTube was aware of this situation for an awfully long time before doing anything about it.

02:46.300 --> 02:52.600
Nine days seems like a pretty delayed reaction to a massive scandal threatening the credibility of your entire site.

02:52.600 --> 02:58.000
So how come YouTube had to spend nine days deciding whether or not to discipline a guy

02:58.000 --> 03:01.800
who everyone immediately agreed is a disgrace to the website?

03:01.800 --> 03:03.800
What on earth took them so long?

03:03.800 --> 03:05.700
Well, I'll tell you what took them so long.

03:05.700 --> 03:11.500
YouTube spent more than a week mulling over whether or not to keep Logan Paul as their poster boy.

03:11.500 --> 03:16.100
It's no secret that ever since PewDiePie's little racism controversy from last year,

03:16.100 --> 03:20.800
YouTube has been grooming Jake and Logan Paul as the next faces of YouTube.

03:20.800 --> 03:23.000
They constantly promote their content.

03:23.000 --> 03:26.500
They give each brother a nice shiny YouTube Red series,

03:26.500 --> 03:28.100
they promote the hell out of that,

03:28.100 --> 03:31.500
and they put the Paul brothers front and center in the YouTube Rewind.

03:31.500 --> 03:36.800
It's so obvious that YouTube is playing favorites with these washed-up Disney Channel stars

03:36.800 --> 03:38.900
and trying to make them the face of their brand.

03:38.900 --> 03:41.000
They ignored all the warning signs.

03:41.000 --> 03:46.800
They ignored all the controversy and evidence that the Paul brothers lacked the stability and the maturity

03:46.800 --> 03:49.300
to represent the entire YouTube community.

03:49.300 --> 03:54.200
Stevie Wonder could have seen that the Paul brothers aren't exactly the most professional candidates

03:54.200 --> 03:56.900
to represent the second biggest site on the web.

03:56.900 --> 03:59.900
As a matter of fact, they're kind of idiots.

03:59.900 --> 04:04.700
But nope, YouTube ignored all of that and went ahead with the Paul brothers world tour.

04:04.700 --> 04:05.900
And what do you know?

04:05.900 --> 04:09.400
They acted like idiots and embarrassed the whole platform.

04:09.400 --> 04:13.900
But the problem for YouTube management was that they had spent the past six months

04:13.900 --> 04:16.300
putting all their eggs in the Paul basket.

04:16.300 --> 04:19.900
And then they go ahead and just fail so spectacularly

04:19.900 --> 04:25.400
that they make YouTube's leadership look like a bunch of hapless morons for even putting them in that position.

04:25.400 --> 04:27.400
I mean, how could they not see this coming?

04:27.400 --> 04:34.700
So the Paul brothers' dumbass hijinks forced YouTube to contemplate backtracking the past six months of their marketing

04:34.700 --> 04:39.200
and put them back to square one in finding their new poster child for the site.

04:39.200 --> 04:41.800
I'm guessing that YouTube didn't want to waste all that effort

04:41.800 --> 04:46.200
so they tried to wait it out and hope that the controversy would just blow over.

04:46.200 --> 04:47.500
But too bad for them.

04:47.500 --> 04:52.100
The Logan Paul video turned into one of the biggest internet shitstorms in recent history.

04:52.100 --> 04:53.300
Let's be honest here.

04:53.300 --> 04:57.000
This was an unsalvageable situation after day one.

04:57.000 --> 05:01.100
Yet it took YouTube more than a week to even respond to the issue.

05:01.100 --> 05:05.100
And YouTube's actual response just pissed me off so much

05:05.100 --> 05:09.000
that I honestly would have felt better if they had just continued doing nothing.

05:09.000 --> 05:11.800
At least then they could feign a shred of ignorance

05:11.800 --> 05:16.300
rather than forming the startling implication that they spent over a week

05:16.300 --> 05:20.500
contemplating whether or not they should keep this guy as the face of their site.

05:20.500 --> 05:25.800
But no, YouTube finally responds to the biggest public outrage they've faced in recent history

05:25.800 --> 05:28.400
through a whopping five tweets.

05:28.400 --> 05:30.200
So let's take a look at those.

05:30.200 --> 05:34.800
Many of you have been frustrated with our lack of communication recently.

05:34.800 --> 05:36.300
You're right to be.

05:36.300 --> 05:39.300
You deserve to know what's going on.

05:39.300 --> 05:40.800
Yeah, you're right.

05:40.800 --> 05:44.200
I think frustrated is a bit of an understatement at this point.

05:44.200 --> 05:45.700
But way to go YouTube.

05:45.700 --> 05:52.000
I'm so glad you're finally amending your lack of communication by releasing five entire tweets.

05:52.000 --> 05:55.400
I guess it's too much to ask for you guys to make an actual press release

05:55.400 --> 06:00.400
or a video or anything more than a few sentences that probably took five minutes to write.

06:00.400 --> 06:05.700
But I'm glad you guys care so much about the issue that you're responding to it nine days late

06:05.700 --> 06:08.100
in the form of five tweets.

06:08.100 --> 06:10.200
So let's see what YouTube has to say.

06:10.200 --> 06:15.400
Like many others, we were upset by the video that was shared last week.

06:15.400 --> 06:16.300
Really?

06:16.300 --> 06:18.400
You were upset by the video.

06:18.400 --> 06:20.100
Well that really clears things up.

06:20.100 --> 06:25.800
For a second there, I thought you guys were going to be happy with the ass clown parading a dead body all over your platform.

06:25.800 --> 06:29.400
But it's good to know that the video upset you guys too.

06:29.400 --> 06:31.800
Suicide is not a joke.

06:31.800 --> 06:34.900
Nor should it ever be a driving force for views.

06:34.900 --> 06:35.300
Yep.

06:35.300 --> 06:36.200
That's right.

06:36.200 --> 06:37.800
Suicide is bad.

06:37.800 --> 06:40.100
Glad you guys cleared that one up for us.

06:40.100 --> 06:42.200
Suicide is in fact bad.

06:42.200 --> 06:43.100
Good.

06:43.100 --> 06:48.900
We're already three out of five tweets in and so far YouTube has told us that Logan Paul is upsetting

06:48.900 --> 06:51.500
and that suicide is bad.

06:51.500 --> 06:54.300
What a groundbreaking news flash right here.

06:54.300 --> 07:00.700
It took them nine days to figure out that the Logan Paul video is upsetting and that suicide is bad.

07:00.700 --> 07:04.800
I'm so glad YouTube is really giving us the information that we need.

07:04.800 --> 07:07.900
You're really improving your communication here YouTube.

07:07.900 --> 07:10.600
But wait, that's not even the best part.

07:10.600 --> 07:13.900
The channel violated our community guidelines.

07:13.900 --> 07:19.000
We acted accordingly and we are looking at further consequences.

07:19.000 --> 07:19.600
Mm-hmm.

07:19.600 --> 07:20.500
Yep.

07:20.500 --> 07:25.100
Showing a corpse on YouTube does in fact violate the community guidelines.

07:25.100 --> 07:26.000
Let's see here.

07:26.000 --> 07:32.000
YouTube community guidelines and yep, no violent and graphic content.

07:32.000 --> 07:35.900
A hanging suicide victim is pretty violent and graphic.

07:35.900 --> 07:37.300
So that part checks out.

07:37.300 --> 07:41.600
It's good to see that YouTube is aware of their own community guidelines.

07:41.600 --> 07:44.800
In fact, the first half of this tweet is pretty accurate.

07:44.800 --> 07:50.000
But it's the second part of this tweet that that's not exactly true.

07:50.000 --> 07:52.300
We acted accordingly.

07:52.300 --> 07:53.100
What?

07:53.100 --> 07:54.800
What are you talking about?

07:54.800 --> 07:59.400
What kind of devious bamboozling revisionist history is this?

07:59.400 --> 08:03.900
Did YouTube wait nine days to respond to their biggest controversy in years

08:03.900 --> 08:09.500
because they thought we'd forget that they did absolutely nothing to enforce their own guidelines?

08:09.500 --> 08:11.500
They acted accordingly?

08:11.500 --> 08:16.900
Is it standard protocol at YouTube to put videos on trending when they violate your guidelines?

08:16.900 --> 08:20.600
Yeah, you certainly took down videos criticizing Logan's video.

08:20.600 --> 08:22.800
Just not Logan's video.

08:22.800 --> 08:27.400
You let that one stay up for as long as you could until Logan took it down.

08:27.400 --> 08:28.200
Wait a minute.

08:28.200 --> 08:34.300
Do we live in a world where Logan Paul is better at enforcing YouTube's community guidelines than YouTube is?

08:34.300 --> 08:36.200
It's a real head scratcher for sure.

08:36.200 --> 08:37.900
I gotta hand it to you YouTube.

08:37.900 --> 08:43.400
You blatantly lied to your community just three tweets after saying you're gonna improve your communication.

08:43.400 --> 08:44.700
That takes guts.

08:44.700 --> 08:50.600
It's too bad your lie was so obviously untrue that you got called out on it almost immediately.

08:50.600 --> 08:51.500
Just own.

08:51.500 --> 08:53.100
Just own the mistake.

08:53.100 --> 08:55.700
Just own the fucking mistake.

08:55.700 --> 08:59.000
I hate defending you because...

08:59.000 --> 09:00.700
Because I'm like, YouTube's trying.

09:00.700 --> 09:01.600
They're good.

09:01.600 --> 09:04.200
And then you get this fucking softball.

09:04.200 --> 09:09.200
You get this softball of a singular easy to handle situation.

09:09.200 --> 09:11.600
And then you're like, we did everything accordingly.

09:11.600 --> 09:12.200
Shut up.

09:12.200 --> 09:12.700
Really?

09:12.700 --> 09:14.100
God.

09:14.100 --> 09:15.900
You're so stupid.

09:15.900 --> 09:21.100
I guess one good thing that came out of this was that YouTube actually followed through with disciplining Logan.

09:21.100 --> 09:24.900
I thought they were just gonna give him a slap on the wrist and send him to bed without dessert.

09:24.900 --> 09:30.200
But as I was writing this, YouTube actually came out and punished Logan for his actions.

09:30.200 --> 09:35.600
They cancelled his YouTube Red movie sequel and removed him from Google preferred advertising.

09:35.600 --> 09:40.400
Remember last year when PewDiePie messed up and YouTube punished him almost immediately?

09:40.400 --> 09:46.200
Well, how come it took them ten whole days to decide to punish good old FootFace here?

09:46.200 --> 09:50.700
And more importantly, why was Logan Paul granted these privileges in the first place?

09:50.700 --> 09:53.500
I know I talked about this already, but it bears repeating.

09:53.500 --> 09:59.600
Why did YouTube think it was a good idea to tout Logan Paul as the new face of YouTube?

09:59.600 --> 10:08.500
Was YouTube that desperate to find the next 12 year old viewer magnet that they mortgage the stability of their whole site by putting this guy at the helm?

10:08.500 --> 10:13.900
Anyway, YouTube just wraps up their big update with one final middle finger to the community.

10:13.900 --> 10:16.600
It's taken us a long time to respond.

10:16.600 --> 10:19.000
Yep, that's very true, YouTube.

10:19.000 --> 10:20.300
You're right again.

10:20.300 --> 10:24.200
We know the actions of one creator can affect the entire community.

10:24.200 --> 10:31.100
So we'll have more to share soon on the steps we're taking to ensure that a video like this is never circulated again.

10:31.100 --> 10:33.300
Oh, oh, oh, you're taking steps.

10:33.300 --> 10:35.900
Oh goody, YouTube is taking steps.

10:35.900 --> 10:42.500
Those must be some massive strides you're taking to actually enforce the guidelines that you yourself put in place.

10:42.500 --> 10:45.600
Seriously though, what steps even need to be taken here?

10:45.600 --> 10:48.700
Just enforce your own fucking guidelines, YouTube.

10:48.700 --> 10:51.000
This is all your fault.

10:51.000 --> 10:54.400
You brought all this bad publicity on yourselves.

10:54.400 --> 10:56.200
You put this guy in power.

10:56.200 --> 11:02.300
You let him post a video of a dead body while punishing the rest of us for even saying the word suicide.

11:02.300 --> 11:06.000
Just enforce your own rules equally to everyone on the platform.

11:06.000 --> 11:10.400
Stop letting these Google preferred idiots run around above the rules.

11:10.400 --> 11:15.000
Seriously, just man up and admit that you people fucked up.

11:15.000 --> 11:19.800
Stop with these bullshit wishy-washy politician responses.

11:19.800 --> 11:23.800
The problem here is not Logan retarded fuckface Paul.

11:23.800 --> 11:26.100
The problem is you, YouTube.

11:26.100 --> 11:28.700
The problem is fucking you.

11:28.700 --> 11:31.100
You people have zero accountability.

11:31.100 --> 11:38.300
You let all these unstable jackasses take the reins of your sight while shafting your honest-to-god hard-working real YouTubers.

11:38.300 --> 11:41.600
Every time something like this happens, it's the same old shit.

11:41.600 --> 11:47.400
YouTube fucks up, people are outraged, YouTube comes up with some dopey half-assed apology

11:47.400 --> 11:52.000
and then everyone just forgets about it while all the smaller YouTubers have to pick up the slack.

11:52.000 --> 11:57.600
Are you people even aware that Jake Paul also had a fuck-up at the same time as Logan's fuck-up?

11:57.600 --> 11:59.800
YouTube still hasn't done anything to punish Jake.

11:59.800 --> 12:03.600
I'm sure he still has his Google preferred and YouTube Red series.

12:03.600 --> 12:06.800
Well, that's a good thing for Jake since no one noticed his fuck-up

12:06.800 --> 12:11.000
because it was completely overshadowed by his brother's even bigger fuck-up.

12:11.000 --> 12:15.400
Hey, YouTube, why did you make these two the face of your website again?

12:15.400 --> 12:19.100
Do the people running YouTube even watch YouTube videos?

12:19.100 --> 12:20.400
Honest question here.

12:20.400 --> 12:27.100
How could no one working for YouTube realize that the Paul brothers weren't fit to be the poster boys of this website?

12:27.100 --> 12:33.300
Were they just too busy jacking themselves off to the analytics of the number of fifth graders these guys draw to the site?

12:33.300 --> 12:37.200
Whatever the cause, it's another huge fucking oversight

12:37.200 --> 12:42.700
that led to yet another big YouTube blunder that taints the image of the entire site.

12:42.700 --> 12:46.700
If this was just a one-time thing, then maybe you could excuse YouTube.

12:46.700 --> 12:52.500
But what is this, the sixth time YouTube has royally fucked up in the past 18 months?

12:52.500 --> 12:54.600
I've lost fucking count!

12:54.600 --> 13:01.300
It has become painfully clear that the true cancerous tumor that's killing YouTube from the inside

13:01.300 --> 13:04.500
is their managerial and business administration.

13:04.500 --> 13:09.900
At this point, it just seems like YouTube is run by a bunch of 40-year-olds with business and marketing degrees

13:09.900 --> 13:12.600
who have no idea how the internet actually works.

13:12.600 --> 13:18.300
You have all these glad-handing yes-men who have never touched a video camera in their entire lives

13:18.300 --> 13:22.200
in charge of running the biggest video producing platform in the world.

13:22.200 --> 13:27.900
The fates of literally millions of would-be artists are under the control of about a dozen corporate suits

13:27.900 --> 13:30.300
in a boardroom somewhere in California.

13:30.300 --> 13:34.200
And you can chalk up most of this blame to good old Susan Dubya,

13:34.200 --> 13:38.900
the vaunted YouTube CEO who really doesn't seem to do much of anything,

13:38.900 --> 13:42.300
but sit on her ass and smile while this site rots.

13:42.300 --> 13:47.000
Under her tenure, YouTube has undergone by far the worst period in its history.

13:47.000 --> 13:49.800
Since old Dubya took over in 2014,

13:49.800 --> 13:54.100
YouTube has endlessly chased pointless gimmicks and bells and whistles

13:54.100 --> 13:57.200
while ignoring the fundamental flaws of their platform.

13:57.200 --> 14:00.900
They chose to alienate their bread-and-butter core user base

14:00.900 --> 14:05.100
just so they could appeal to as much of the trendy idiot masses as possible

14:05.100 --> 14:07.500
who don't give a shit about the quality of the site.

14:07.500 --> 14:11.600
YouTube has been run so poorly over the past year and a half in particular

14:11.600 --> 14:18.600
that I would not be surprised if anyone in charge there spends more than five minutes a week watching YouTube videos.

14:18.600 --> 14:25.000
They just have to be completely oblivious to what's actually happening on YouTube based on the decisions they've made.

14:25.000 --> 14:33.700
Can you imagine if a company like Walmart or McDonald's fucked up as often and as severely as YouTube does on a regular basis?

14:33.700 --> 14:36.400
They would get slaughtered by their competitors.

14:36.400 --> 14:42.200
But the problem with YouTube is that they hold a de facto monopoly on user-generated video streaming.

14:42.200 --> 14:43.600
There's nowhere else to go.

14:43.600 --> 14:46.400
YouTube has the money and the advertisers

14:46.400 --> 14:53.000
and until a real competitor appears that offers content creators a real financial incentive to jump ship,

14:53.000 --> 14:56.700
this site will continue to be run by incompetent people.

14:56.700 --> 15:02.700
YouTube's management doesn't even have to hold themselves to the same standards of companies like Facebook and Twitter.

15:02.700 --> 15:05.900
At least those companies have to answer to stockholders.

15:05.900 --> 15:07.800
Who does YouTube have to answer to?

15:07.800 --> 15:08.400
No one.

15:08.400 --> 15:14.300
They can run the site straight into the ground and they'll just be caught by the big old Google safety net.

15:14.300 --> 15:18.200
No one gets fired and everything just continues to get worse and worse,

15:18.200 --> 15:21.300
but not bad enough for anyone to actually get fired.

15:21.300 --> 15:24.300
YouTube has no accountability whatsoever.

15:24.300 --> 15:28.400
They barely communicate anything to the community and when they do,

15:28.400 --> 15:35.800
it's usually just cryptic bullshit like this where they try and cover their asses by duct-taping the gaping problems in their site

15:35.800 --> 15:40.200
and they end up creating more questions than answers while solving nothing.

15:40.200 --> 15:42.300
And you want to know what the worst part is?

15:42.300 --> 15:43.800
Everyone buys it.

15:43.800 --> 15:45.300
Way to go, YouTube.

15:45.300 --> 15:48.100
You did something that should have been done 10 days ago.

15:48.100 --> 15:50.400
Here's a pat on the back and a gold sticker.

15:50.400 --> 15:51.800
We forgive you.

15:51.800 --> 15:56.900
When are you people gonna get your heads out of your asses and realize the real problem here?

15:56.900 --> 16:02.500
You chant ding-dong the witch is dead every time the next jackass YouTuber finally gets his comeuppance

16:02.500 --> 16:04.400
and then you move on to the next witch hunt.

16:04.400 --> 16:09.200
And then six months later, you do it all over again and again and again.

16:09.200 --> 16:13.700
It's just an endless cycle because you people are not treating the real problem.

16:13.700 --> 16:15.800
You're treating a symptom of the problem.

16:15.800 --> 16:18.500
Logan Paul was never the problem.

16:18.500 --> 16:21.800
YouTube is the problem here.

16:21.800 --> 16:25.000
So stop focusing on trying to tear down the YouTubers

16:25.000 --> 16:30.500
and start focusing on the site that enables and propagates this toxic behavior.

16:30.500 --> 16:37.200
Stop giving YouTube a free pass just for doing the bare minimum of what's already common sense to most people.

16:37.200 --> 16:42.000
We need to hold the biggest video streaming site on the web to a higher standard.

16:42.000 --> 16:46.200
If we don't hold YouTube accountable for their problems, then no one else will.

16:46.200 --> 16:49.900
And yes, this is me going off on yet another YouTube rant.

16:49.900 --> 16:53.800
Boo-hoo, wow-ass, so sad, complain, complain, just unsubscribe already.

16:53.800 --> 16:54.800
I don't give a shit.

16:54.800 --> 16:59.300
Go watch one of the 10,000 Jake Paul rants if you don't like what you're hearing from me

16:59.300 --> 17:03.400
and then come back to me when YouTube fucks up yet again in two months.

17:03.400 --> 17:04.800
But this video isn't about me.

17:04.800 --> 17:06.700
I don't even like making these videos.

17:06.700 --> 17:09.000
I wish I didn't have to make these videos.

17:09.000 --> 17:13.400
I'd much rather spend my time making actual genuine content that I enjoy.

17:13.400 --> 17:18.200
I'm just a guy who wants to make some videos and entertain some people.

17:18.200 --> 17:22.800
But this is an issue I have to talk about because if I don't, nobody else will.

17:22.800 --> 17:27.200
And YouTube just makes it that much more necessary for me by being incompetent.

17:27.300 --> 17:30.500
I don't make these YouTube rants for views and attention.

17:30.500 --> 17:32.500
I don't make these rants for me.

17:32.500 --> 17:35.900
I make these rants because I want YouTube to be better.

17:35.900 --> 17:40.900
I make these rants because when I look at this site and see what it's become, it sickens me.

17:40.900 --> 17:46.300
At the end of the day, YouTube is still a good site with tons of upsides.

17:46.300 --> 17:50.200
But the fact that it could be so much better is just sad.

17:50.200 --> 17:54.700
And yes, I know it's difficult to run a massive site like YouTube.

17:54.700 --> 18:01.900
But when we've reached the point where pretty much every decision YouTube makes is hated by the majority of the community,

18:01.900 --> 18:07.000
maybe it's time to start asking the people running this site to be better.

18:07.000 --> 18:10.600
I'm so sick of all these people making excuses for YouTube.

18:10.600 --> 18:12.300
YouTube is not your friend.

18:12.300 --> 18:15.600
YouTube is not a benevolent mom-and-pop company.

18:15.600 --> 18:22.500
They're part of a multi-billion dollar corporation that has access to any resources it could possibly need.

18:22.500 --> 18:26.800
So I don't want to hear how YouTube is just doing the best they can because they aren't.

18:26.800 --> 18:34.200
The number of problems YouTube creates for itself on a regular basis is inexcusable for a company of its stature.

18:34.200 --> 18:38.100
And the people in charge clearly aren't equipped to run this site.

18:38.100 --> 18:44.100
And until these people are expunged from power, all these problems are just gonna keep happening.

18:44.100 --> 18:52.400
So is it too much to ask for the people running the second biggest site on the web to actually give a shit?

18:52.400 --> 18:53.500
Is it?
