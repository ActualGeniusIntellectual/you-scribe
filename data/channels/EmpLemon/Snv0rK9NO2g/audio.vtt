At first, I didn't think this meme would go anywhere, but lo and behold, the meme community

00:15.720 --> 00:22.680
put so much effort into innovating this thing that it exceeded everyone's expectations.

00:22.680 --> 00:27.380
Interchangeable Infinity War meme number one.

00:27.380 --> 00:31.680
This is technically an April meme, but I wanted to cover it anyway just to document how much

00:31.680 --> 00:34.100
of a pathetic mistake it was.

00:34.100 --> 00:39.780
This was a meme so painfully bland, derivative, and unfunny that even the most basic normies

00:39.780 --> 00:41.420
eventually disowned it.

00:41.420 --> 00:44.100
Just a complete failure in every sense of the word.

00:44.100 --> 00:46.620
What are you possibly doing?

00:46.620 --> 00:53.780
Finally, a meme making fun of oblivious idiots instead of pandering to them.

00:53.780 --> 00:59.560
Simpson's shitposting delivers again with this very solid meme.

00:59.560 --> 01:00.560
Could it be?

01:00.560 --> 01:03.360
A meme based on a trendy song that's actually funny?

01:03.360 --> 01:09.500
Bonus points for making the faux journalists actually reject a meme for once.

01:09.500 --> 01:14.020
Interchangeable Infinity War meme number two.

01:14.020 --> 01:17.460
The Dress 2.

01:17.460 --> 01:21.460
I don't really care about this dull meme, so instead I'm gonna rant about the term

01:21.460 --> 01:22.460
millennial.

01:22.460 --> 01:27.540
I cannot stand this word, and this is coming from a guy who uses the word normie unironically.

01:27.540 --> 01:31.260
This fucking word needs to be deleted from the lexicon entirely.

01:31.260 --> 01:34.860
Nobody actually knows what it means, and it seems like the only people who use it are

01:34.860 --> 01:39.240
washed up 35-year-olds who want to passive-aggressively disparage young people.

01:39.240 --> 01:42.700
So fuck the word millennial and fuck 35-year-olds.

01:42.700 --> 01:46.220
And uh, this meme is meh.

01:46.220 --> 01:47.860
The Dab 2.

01:47.860 --> 01:51.380
Let's face it, this trend will be on the Ellen show in a few months.

01:51.380 --> 01:55.300
It's just hoost of two.

01:55.300 --> 01:59.780
But I actually enjoy these memes that tinker with the basic concept of language.

01:59.780 --> 02:06.580
After all, aren't memes just the universal language of internet culture?

02:06.580 --> 02:10.880
This meme is gay.

02:10.880 --> 02:17.500
Well, that's all the memes for me.

02:17.500 --> 02:19.180
Some good, some not so good.

02:19.580 --> 02:25.020
Do you think that angry, self-righteous journalists are gonna write a hit piece calling me a homophobic

02:25.020 --> 02:27.940
bigot for using the word gay as an insult?

02:27.940 --> 02:28.580
Probably.
