1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,720
At first, I didn't think this meme would go anywhere, but lo and behold, the meme community

2
00:00:15,720 --> 00:00:22,680
put so much effort into innovating this thing that it exceeded everyone's expectations.

3
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:27,380
Interchangeable Infinity War meme number one.

4
00:00:27,380 --> 00:00:31,680
This is technically an April meme, but I wanted to cover it anyway just to document how much

5
00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:34,100
of a pathetic mistake it was.

6
00:00:34,100 --> 00:00:39,780
This was a meme so painfully bland, derivative, and unfunny that even the most basic normies

7
00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:41,420
eventually disowned it.

8
00:00:41,420 --> 00:00:44,100
Just a complete failure in every sense of the word.

9
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:46,620
What are you possibly doing?

10
00:00:46,620 --> 00:00:53,780
Finally, a meme making fun of oblivious idiots instead of pandering to them.

11
00:00:53,780 --> 00:00:59,560
Simpson's shitposting delivers again with this very solid meme.

12
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:00,560
Could it be?

13
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:03,360
A meme based on a trendy song that's actually funny?

14
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:09,500
Bonus points for making the faux journalists actually reject a meme for once.

15
00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:14,020
Interchangeable Infinity War meme number two.

16
00:01:14,020 --> 00:01:17,460
The Dress 2.

17
00:01:17,460 --> 00:01:21,460
I don't really care about this dull meme, so instead I'm gonna rant about the term

18
00:01:21,460 --> 00:01:22,460
millennial.

19
00:01:22,460 --> 00:01:27,540
I cannot stand this word, and this is coming from a guy who uses the word normie unironically.

20
00:01:27,540 --> 00:01:31,260
This fucking word needs to be deleted from the lexicon entirely.

21
00:01:31,260 --> 00:01:34,860
Nobody actually knows what it means, and it seems like the only people who use it are

22
00:01:34,860 --> 00:01:39,240
washed up 35-year-olds who want to passive-aggressively disparage young people.

23
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:42,700
So fuck the word millennial and fuck 35-year-olds.

24
00:01:42,700 --> 00:01:46,220
And uh, this meme is meh.

25
00:01:46,220 --> 00:01:47,860
The Dab 2.

26
00:01:47,860 --> 00:01:51,380
Let's face it, this trend will be on the Ellen show in a few months.

27
00:01:51,380 --> 00:01:55,300
It's just hoost of two.

28
00:01:55,300 --> 00:01:59,780
But I actually enjoy these memes that tinker with the basic concept of language.

29
00:01:59,780 --> 00:02:06,580
After all, aren't memes just the universal language of internet culture?

30
00:02:06,580 --> 00:02:10,880
This meme is gay.

31
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:17,500
Well, that's all the memes for me.

32
00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:19,180
Some good, some not so good.

33
00:02:19,580 --> 00:02:25,020
Do you think that angry, self-righteous journalists are gonna write a hit piece calling me a homophobic

34
00:02:25,020 --> 00:02:27,940
bigot for using the word gay as an insult?

35
00:02:27,940 --> 00:02:28,580
Probably.
