0	15720	At first, I didn't think this meme would go anywhere, but lo and behold, the meme community
15720	22680	put so much effort into innovating this thing that it exceeded everyone's expectations.
22680	27380	Interchangeable Infinity War meme number one.
27380	31680	This is technically an April meme, but I wanted to cover it anyway just to document how much
31680	34100	of a pathetic mistake it was.
34100	39780	This was a meme so painfully bland, derivative, and unfunny that even the most basic normies
39780	41420	eventually disowned it.
41420	44100	Just a complete failure in every sense of the word.
44100	46620	What are you possibly doing?
46620	53780	Finally, a meme making fun of oblivious idiots instead of pandering to them.
53780	59560	Simpson's shitposting delivers again with this very solid meme.
59560	60560	Could it be?
60560	63360	A meme based on a trendy song that's actually funny?
63360	69500	Bonus points for making the faux journalists actually reject a meme for once.
69500	74020	Interchangeable Infinity War meme number two.
74020	77460	The Dress 2.
77460	81460	I don't really care about this dull meme, so instead I'm gonna rant about the term
81460	82460	millennial.
82460	87540	I cannot stand this word, and this is coming from a guy who uses the word normie unironically.
87540	91260	This fucking word needs to be deleted from the lexicon entirely.
91260	94860	Nobody actually knows what it means, and it seems like the only people who use it are
94860	99240	washed up 35-year-olds who want to passive-aggressively disparage young people.
99240	102700	So fuck the word millennial and fuck 35-year-olds.
102700	106220	And uh, this meme is meh.
106220	107860	The Dab 2.
107860	111380	Let's face it, this trend will be on the Ellen show in a few months.
111380	115300	It's just hoost of two.
115300	119780	But I actually enjoy these memes that tinker with the basic concept of language.
119780	126580	After all, aren't memes just the universal language of internet culture?
126580	130880	This meme is gay.
130880	137500	Well, that's all the memes for me.
137500	139180	Some good, some not so good.
139580	145020	Do you think that angry, self-righteous journalists are gonna write a hit piece calling me a homophobic
145020	147940	bigot for using the word gay as an insult?
147940	148580	Probably.
