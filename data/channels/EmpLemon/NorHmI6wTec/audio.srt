Brought to you by Manscaped.

2
00:00:04,800 --> 00:00:08,800
It's once again that time of the year when we revisit the horror genre,

3
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:14,600
and few movies are as horrifying as John Carpenter's 1982 film, The Thing.

4
00:00:14,600 --> 00:00:20,000
The story of an unstoppable virus plunging a small community into total isolation.

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:26,200
As you can probably tell, it's a film that was remarkably ahead of its time, almost to its own detriment.

6
00:00:26,200 --> 00:00:32,200
While the film is universally acclaimed today, audiences in 1982 initially hated it.

7
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:38,400
A combination of poor marketing and stiff competition doomed the film to a lackluster theatrical release.

8
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:43,600
The Thing went head-to-head with Blade Runner in the sci-fi department and Poltergeist in the horror department,

9
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:46,000
losing out to both at the box office.

10
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:52,800
But perhaps the biggest obstacle in the way of its success was the highest-grossing film of 1982, E.T.

11
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:59,600
As yet another film depicting an encounter with alien life, E.T. served as the direct antithesis to The Thing.

12
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:04,200
At the time, the U.S. was in the midst of its worst recession since World War II,

13
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:11,800
and audiences gravitated more towards the whimsical escapism of E.T., with nationwide unemployment surpassing 10%.

14
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:16,400
Moviegoers were not thrilled with the gloomy, nihilistic overtones of The Thing.

15
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:21,800
Even more hostile than the audience were the critics, who slammed the film with negative reviews.

16
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:27,600
Most of the discussion was fixated on the movie's most identifiable element, the special effects.

17
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:32,600
The Thing featured some of the most innovative and unique creature effects of any film in history,

18
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:37,400
nearly all of which were conceived and implemented by prosthetic makeup artist Rob Bettine.

19
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:44,600
$1.5 million of the film's budget was spent on the creature effects, and the result was as impressive as it was gruesome.

20
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:50,800
In the age before computer graphics, all of the effects had to be done practically, using real models and materials.

21
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:56,200
Up to 50 technicians operated the models through a system of hydraulics, gases, and wires.

22
00:01:56,200 --> 00:02:02,800
The project was so ambitious that Bettine worked over a year without a single day off while living entirely out of the studio.

23
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:09,800
At one point, he was even hospitalized for exhaustion, suffering numerous medical ailments from the sheer stress of the workload.

24
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:14,800
For the filmmakers, the finished product represented a remarkable technical achievement.

25
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:20,800
But for audiences, the effects were so shockingly grotesque that they overshadowed the greater philosophy of the film.

26
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:27,600
Critics tended to treat the effects as an excessive gimmick, suggesting that the rest of the movie had very little to offer.

27
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:36,800
While mostly derided as overkill at the time, the effects were entirely necessary to establish perhaps the most important aspect of the film, the monster.

28
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:50,800
Hello, Kino Corner here. I'm currently in Antarctica, and there's a dog on the loose who I think might actually be an alien.

29
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:53,800
Look! There he is!

30
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:59,800
This monster, this alien, is not some little green man.

31
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:05,800
It came to Earth on a flying saucer, but that's where the similarities with our normal conception of aliens ends.

32
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:10,800
And it definitely diverges from the man in a rubber suit alien in the original version of The Thing.

33
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:14,800
This alien is us. Or at least, it appears to be.

34
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:21,800
Really, it's everything that it's ever encountered over at least tens of thousands of years of existence across multiple planets.

35
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:24,800
It goes beyond being just a simple mimic.

36
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:30,800
This isn't like Invasion of the Body Snatchers, where people are just replaced by identical but alien versions of themselves.

37
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:37,800
It's not as simple as that. It's a Lovecraft-inspired cosmic horror that has devoured God knows how much of the universe.

38
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:40,800
And we are just another step along its path.

39
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:44,800
And how can we stop something that we don't even understand?

40
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:49,800
What power do we possess in the face of this utterly incomprehensible terror?

41
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:51,800
But this thing is not a thing.

42
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:57,800
Each cell is its own entity with its own will to survive, and part of surviving is camouflage.

43
00:03:57,800 --> 00:04:03,800
But because it can assume the form of everything it has consumed, we're given grotesque creations.

44
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:08,800
Amalgamations of man, beast, and something else, blending body horror with science fiction.

45
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:13,800
Rob Bottin, who was only 23 at the time but had previously worked with Carpenter on The Fog,

46
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:18,800
pitched the idea to Carpenter that the monster could be anything, and Carpenter ran with it.

47
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:24,800
What ensued was about 14 months of working 7 days a week in order to create all the models used in the movie,

48
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:27,800
which also meant lots and lots of latex.

49
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:31,800
With these creatures, they were pushing the limits of special effects at the time,

50
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:35,800
but even so, if you were to look at any of the monsters in even lighting, they would look fake.

51
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:38,800
Rob Bottin and his crew might have created these horrors,

52
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:43,800
but cinematographer Dean Cundey brought them to life by masking their imperfections in shadow,

53
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:48,800
and using contrasty and moody lighting to add another layer of dread and fear to their presence.

54
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:53,800
Each one of these latex abominations was life-sized, apart from a couple miniature shots,

55
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:59,800
and incredibly detailed, causing them to lag behind the rest of the production as you can probably imagine.

56
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:04,800
Most of, but not all of the shots of the various incarnations of The Thing were filmed after the movie wrapped.

57
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:09,800
Carpenter covered the scenes appropriately so that he could fit the shots of the aliens into the movie,

58
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:14,800
but that led to many of the actors not actually knowing what The Thing looked like until they saw the film.

59
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:15,800
Clear!

60
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:20,800
And I think that that actually helped the film,

61
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:26,800
because as disgusting and as horrific as the monsters are, the true horror of The Thing is psychological.

62
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:33,800
Who can you trust? Who is infected? Can you even trust yourself?

63
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:36,800
At the beginning of the movie, MacCready plays chess with the computer.

64
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:39,800
The computer always knows the best move, so it wins.

65
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:45,800
But MacCready enacts his revenge by pouring his whiskey into the computer, frying it.

66
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:47,800
It's a microcosm for the film as a whole.

67
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:52,800
MacCready plays a game of chess with The Thing, and every man at the station is a piece on the board.

68
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:56,800
The psychological horror emerges out of this cosmic game of wits.

69
00:05:56,800 --> 00:06:00,800
And, spoiler alert, the film ends just like how the chess game ended.

70
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:06,800
Alright, now let's see who here is an imposter.

71
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:10,800
Get away from me!

72
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:18,800
Despite being a monster from out of this world, The Thing manages to be disturbingly realistic in its execution.

73
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:21,800
This trait is mirrored by the protagonists as well.

74
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:24,800
The film was initially criticized for a lack of strong characters,

75
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:29,800
but the relatively simple demeanor of the cast only adds to the overall tension and atmosphere.

76
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:36,800
The juxtaposition of any ordinary character revealing themselves as an incomprehensible monster is what creates the suspense.

77
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:40,800
It's for this reason why something like the blood test scene is so compelling.

78
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:45,800
The lack of specific character development actually helps the story remain unpredictable.

79
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:51,800
The individual characters are not relevant to the overall premise because The Thing is not a character-driven film.

80
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:57,800
You could have told the same story with Siberian prison guards or Area 51 agents and it wouldn't have made a difference.

81
00:06:57,800 --> 00:07:04,800
The Thing functions much better as an allegory, with each character representing a different archetype of how people act in crisis.

82
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:09,800
Just as the monster is not inherently evil, the crew are not inherently heroic.

83
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:13,800
MacReady, the main protagonist, murders an innocent crew member.

84
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:20,800
That clock was human, huh? Which makes you a murderer, don't it?

85
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:25,800
He becomes the de facto leader of the group not because he is the most virtuous or sensible,

86
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:28,800
but because he is the most paranoid and brazen.

87
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:31,800
Anybody touches me, here we go.

88
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:35,800
Some critics question the lack of group cohesion among the crew,

89
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:39,800
finding it implausible that the men did not band together to defeat The Thing.

90
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:42,800
Contrary to the idealistic whims of the 80s audience,

91
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:48,800
the film presents a fairly accurate portrayal of how real people tend to act in conflict.

92
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:54,800
There is overwhelming historical precedent to suggest that people become increasingly atomized while under duress.

93
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:59,800
Everyone dreams of a gallant hero swooping in to magically solve all of our problems,

94
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:03,800
but in reality our only salvation comes from men like MacReady,

95
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:07,800
those who have no choice but to pick the least terrible option.

96
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:11,800
They will be met with fire and fury.

97
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:19,800
The Thing could be described by some as prophetic with its portrayal of paranoid isolation,

98
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:22,800
but its themes undoubtedly echo the real-world events of the time.

99
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:25,800
The early 80s saw the rise of the AIDS epidemic,

100
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:30,800
a mysterious and incurable virus whose carriers were indistinguishable from the average person.

101
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:34,800
The social reaction to the virus was far from cohesive.

102
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:37,800
The infected were ostracized and abandoned by their communities.

103
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:41,800
Gays and other minority groups faced unjust discrimination.

104
00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:47,800
People and governments neglected the epidemic until it started affecting the most illustrious members of society.

105
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:52,800
By the end of the 80s, three-quarters of a million people were infected in the US alone.

106
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:57,800
In hindsight, did our society really handle things that much better than MacReady?

107
00:08:57,800 --> 00:09:00,800
I don't know who to trust.

108
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:03,800
Trust is a tough thing to come by these days.

109
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:07,800
A more broad inspiration for The Thing was the prevailing Cold War.

110
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:11,800
The collapse of group harmony draws immediate parallels to the Red Scare,

111
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:16,800
which tore apart American communities by injecting paranoia over communist sympathizers.

112
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:20,800
The Thing more subtly alludes to the threat of mutually assured destruction.

113
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:27,800
MacReady is so determined to defeat the monster that he no longer values the preservation of himself or the crew.

114
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:29,800
We're not getting out of here alive.

115
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:31,800
But neither is that thing.

116
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:37,800
The film literally ends with a fiery mushroom cloud

117
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:41,800
and the two remaining crew members resigning themselves to a mutual demise.

118
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:47,800
Just one year after the film's release, a lone Soviet officer would save us from meeting the same fate.

119
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:53,800
Perhaps the most frightening aspect of The Thing is not the monster, but the horrors of human nature itself.

120
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:56,800
Paranoia, mistrust, isolation and assimilation.

121
00:09:56,800 --> 00:10:01,800
The film has a lot to say about what compels us to turn against our fellow man.

122
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:05,800
How far do you have to push people before they justify homicidal acts?

123
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:11,800
The zombie genre tends to depict homicide by portraying the infected as physically and mentally corrupted.

124
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:15,800
In many aspects, a zombie has lost the traits which make it human,

125
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:19,800
and the protagonist can indiscriminately slaughter them without remorse.

126
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:24,800
The Thing complicates this premise by making the infected identical in appearance to the rest of the crew.

127
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:29,800
Many crew members at first experience guilt or hesitation upon killing the mimic

128
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:33,800
because they are unable to truly separate the image of their peers from the monster.

129
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:38,800
MacReady, I know bad things. I've known him for ten years. He's my friend.

130
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:40,800
You gotta burn the rest of him.

131
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:46,800
Only MacReady, the least empathetic character, is able to dispatch the infected with confidence.

132
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:53,800
But ironically, in acting without emotional attachment, the crew gradually begin to lose touch with their own humanity.

133
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:59,800
Just as the monster learns to act more human, the humans begin to act more like the monster.

134
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:06,800
If it takes us over, then it has no more enemies.

135
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:11,800
Nobody left to kill it. And then it's won.

136
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:16,800
Biologically speaking, a virus is not classified as a living thing.

137
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:22,800
Despite posing a major threat to life, viruses are entirely dependent on life to propagate.

138
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:29,800
In a similar sense, ideas, beliefs, and perceptions can only really exist within the host of the human mind.

139
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:35,800
The film becomes perhaps the most fascinating when you view the monster as a metaphor for ideology.

140
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:42,800
The disgusting appearance of The Thing may serve as a representation of the ugliness we see in opposing belief systems.

141
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:50,800
The very same psychological effects experienced by the fictional crew have been used to justify some of the worst atrocities that mankind has ever witnessed.

142
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:56,800
Somebody in this camp ain't what he appears to be. Right now, that may be one or two of us. By spring, it could be all of us.

143
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:59,800
There exists a latent theme of purity within The Thing.

144
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:04,800
Each piece of the infected material serves as a functional part of the entire alien being.

145
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:10,800
Maybe every part of him was a whole. Every little piece was an individual animal.

146
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:14,800
If a small particle of this thing is enough to take over an entire organism...

147
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:21,800
Conversely, each crew member seeks to retain purity from the monster, or risk allowing the healthy to become corrupted.

148
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:27,800
This echoes how fanatical ideologues relinquish their individuality to serve a greater vision of society.

149
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:32,800
Those who do not align with the vision must either be assimilated or exterminated.

150
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:36,800
The opposing ideologies are doomed to wage war until only the pure survive.

151
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:41,800
At the end of it all, MacCready and Child sit face to face as the two remaining survivors.

152
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:49,800
After all the violence and destruction, neither the protagonist nor the audience are any closer to figuring out who The Thing really is.

153
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:54,800
The two survivors are utterly paralyzed, not by fear, but by total mistrust.

154
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:59,800
It is through this situation which the film truly hammers in its most compelling theme...

155
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:00,800
Isolation.

156
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:05,800
Even though the characters have found each other in this moment, each has never felt more alone.

157
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:09,800
From the very beginning, the film establishes a paradox of isolation.

158
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:14,800
Separating people from others simultaneously makes them more safe and more vulnerable.

159
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:22,800
To protect human civilization from an apocalyptic pandemic, Blair has no choice but to isolate the crew from the outside world entirely.

160
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:26,800
But in doing so, leaves them with no reinforcements in fighting the monster.

161
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:33,800
When MacCready and the rest of the crew quarantine Blair, they ensure their temporary safety while creating a future vulnerability.

162
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:38,800
Within a group there's strength in numbers, but also a greater risk of being in the presence of the monster.

163
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:44,800
When splitting up, the monster is less likely to be present, but has a much easier way to attack.

164
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:51,800
As the characters descend further into paranoid hysteria, they become mentally and emotionally isolated from one another.

165
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:55,800
Making it more difficult for anyone to cooperate and defeat the monster.

166
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:57,800
Nobody trusts anybody now.

167
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:03,800
We're all very tired. There's nothing else I can do.

168
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:05,800
Just wait.

169
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:12,800
The final scene of The Thing has sparked numerous theories over which of the men could be infected, or whether any of them are infected at all.

170
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:17,800
Lead actor Kurt Russell interjected that analyzing the scene in this way is missing the point.

171
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:24,800
And that the ambiguity of the ending is a rhetorical device designed to make the audience just as paranoid as the characters on screen.

172
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:30,800
By the end of the film, we, just like MacCready and Childs, have absolutely nothing but doubt.

173
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:35,800
Only through total mistrust can we achieve a state of profound isolation.

174
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:40,800
When you lose all faith in the world around you, you become nothing more than a prisoner in your own mind.

175
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:48,800
Hey Blair!

176
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:53,800
Blair, have you seen Fuchs?

177
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:58,800
My favorite scene in the movie is when MacCready goes to check on Blair after quarantining him.

178
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:07,800
There's just something so unsettling about Blair calmly and uncharacteristically asking to be let back in the base as a noose ominously dangles in front of him.

179
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:13,800
There's no action, violence, or immediate threat to the characters. It just feels off.

180
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:18,800
As a viewer, this moment for me represents the psychological point of no return.

181
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:26,800
Beyond this, we have officially crossed the event horizon of uncertainty, where no character is trustworthy until proven otherwise.

182
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:33,800
Has Blair really calmed down? Has he succumbed to the madness entirely? Is he an imitation trying to act human?

183
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:37,800
What if MacCready is an imitation and he's just leaving an innocent man to die?

184
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:40,800
So many questions, so little time.

185
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:45,800
For me, this scene perfectly captures why The Thing is such a remarkable film.

186
00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:48,800
And its calmest moments manage to be utterly terrifying.

187
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:55,800
Human intellect is capable of feats unprecedented to the rest of nature.

188
00:15:55,800 --> 00:16:01,800
Our unique abilities to reason and ask questions has allowed us to utterly dominate the natural world.

189
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:06,800
However, these same abilities also present us with a unique challenge in self-destruction.

190
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:12,800
We can survive in climates inhospitable to nearly all other forms of life, but can we survive each other?

191
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:16,800
Both viruses and ideology challenge the mastery of our domain.

192
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:24,800
We have transcended the animal kingdom to such an extent that we have mostly lost sight of how it feels to be threatened by the world around us.

193
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:30,800
Films like The Thing provide us with a disturbing glimpse into just how close we may be to the edge of control.

194
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:35,800
The film is truly unnerving because it reminds us of the darkest parts of ourselves.

195
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:41,800
The primary reason for the film aging so well is that we are now more paranoid and isolated than ever before.

196
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:46,800
Watching it back today, The Thing appears much more realistic than nihilistic.

197
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:51,800
How many of us now are locked in an endless confrontation with our own version of The Thing?

198
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:57,800
Ironically, while the far more popular films of its era have mostly faded from the public consciousness,

199
00:16:57,800 --> 00:17:04,800
the robust themes of The Thing remain just as relevant today, nearly 40 years since its inception.

200
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:08,800
My blood from one of you things won't obey when it's attacked.

201
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:10,800
It'll try and survive.

202
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:19,800
In the long run, The Thing managed to outlast both the competition and the critics.

203
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:24,800
Its initial negative reception may go down as one of the most baffling trends in film criticism.

204
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:31,800
Sadly, The Thing's lackluster release would spark the beginning of the end for John Carpenter's career as a blockbuster director.

205
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:36,800
The hostile audience response to the film derailed Carpenter's directorial confidence,

206
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:40,800
and he struggled to find much commercial or critical success after this point.

207
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:48,800
After rewatching the film on home video, audiences gradually warmed up to The Thing, and the film developed a cult following.

208
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:54,800
It has since been reassessed as a masterpiece in the horror genre, with some calling it Carpenter's best work.

209
00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:59,800
Today, The Thing lives on in a new generation of creative work which carries on its legacy.

210
00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:06,800
The concept of an alien imposter infiltrating a small community continues to thrive as a compelling psychological exercise.

211
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:15,800
And now, as we all confront the perils of a quarantined world, one has to wonder just how much of the movie will cross over into reality.

212
00:18:15,800 --> 00:18:23,800
So with each passing year, as everyone gets a little less trusting and a little more isolated, just remember to stay safe out there.

213
00:18:23,800 --> 00:18:34,800
Alright guys, you know the plan. We hang out here, and when the murderer shows up, that's when we attack.

214
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:41,800
How are we gonna know that he's the murderer? Well, he'll usually let you know that he's a murderer before he kills you.

215
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:43,800
So we just wait here?

216
00:18:43,800 --> 00:18:46,800
Yep.

217
00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:55,800

Recently, many of us have seen our personal grooming get out of control. I am declaring a pubic health emergency.

220
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:12,800
It's time to break open the performance package kit.

221
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:16,800
Is your hairy groin making you look like a Lovecraftian monster?

Try the new Lawn Mower 3.0 with SkinSafe technology to reduce nicks and cuts.

223
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:32,800

224
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:37,800
Nose and ear hair getting too woolly? Chop it down with the Weed Whacker.

225
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:41,800
Nails becoming an epidemic? Quarantine them with Shears 2.0.
