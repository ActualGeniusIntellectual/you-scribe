4800	8800	It's once again that time of the year when we revisit the horror genre,
8800	14600	and few movies are as horrifying as John Carpenter's 1982 film, The Thing.
14600	20000	The story of an unstoppable virus plunging a small community into total isolation.
20000	26200	As you can probably tell, it's a film that was remarkably ahead of its time, almost to its own detriment.
26200	32200	While the film is universally acclaimed today, audiences in 1982 initially hated it.
32200	38400	A combination of poor marketing and stiff competition doomed the film to a lackluster theatrical release.
38400	43600	The Thing went head-to-head with Blade Runner in the sci-fi department and Poltergeist in the horror department,
43600	46000	losing out to both at the box office.
46000	52800	But perhaps the biggest obstacle in the way of its success was the highest-grossing film of 1982, E.T.
52800	59600	As yet another film depicting an encounter with alien life, E.T. served as the direct antithesis to The Thing.
59600	64200	At the time, the U.S. was in the midst of its worst recession since World War II,
64200	71800	and audiences gravitated more towards the whimsical escapism of E.T., with nationwide unemployment surpassing 10%.
71800	76400	Moviegoers were not thrilled with the gloomy, nihilistic overtones of The Thing.
76400	81800	Even more hostile than the audience were the critics, who slammed the film with negative reviews.
81800	87600	Most of the discussion was fixated on the movie's most identifiable element, the special effects.
87600	92600	The Thing featured some of the most innovative and unique creature effects of any film in history,
92600	97400	nearly all of which were conceived and implemented by prosthetic makeup artist Rob Bettine.
97400	104600	$1.5 million of the film's budget was spent on the creature effects, and the result was as impressive as it was gruesome.
104600	110800	In the age before computer graphics, all of the effects had to be done practically, using real models and materials.
110800	116200	Up to 50 technicians operated the models through a system of hydraulics, gases, and wires.
116200	122800	The project was so ambitious that Bettine worked over a year without a single day off while living entirely out of the studio.
122800	129800	At one point, he was even hospitalized for exhaustion, suffering numerous medical ailments from the sheer stress of the workload.
129800	134800	For the filmmakers, the finished product represented a remarkable technical achievement.
134800	140800	But for audiences, the effects were so shockingly grotesque that they overshadowed the greater philosophy of the film.
140800	147600	Critics tended to treat the effects as an excessive gimmick, suggesting that the rest of the movie had very little to offer.
147600	156800	While mostly derided as overkill at the time, the effects were entirely necessary to establish perhaps the most important aspect of the film, the monster.
156800	170800	Hello, Kino Corner here. I'm currently in Antarctica, and there's a dog on the loose who I think might actually be an alien.
170800	173800	Look! There he is!
173800	179800	This monster, this alien, is not some little green man.
179800	185800	It came to Earth on a flying saucer, but that's where the similarities with our normal conception of aliens ends.
185800	190800	And it definitely diverges from the man in a rubber suit alien in the original version of The Thing.
190800	194800	This alien is us. Or at least, it appears to be.
194800	201800	Really, it's everything that it's ever encountered over at least tens of thousands of years of existence across multiple planets.
201800	204800	It goes beyond being just a simple mimic.
204800	210800	This isn't like Invasion of the Body Snatchers, where people are just replaced by identical but alien versions of themselves.
210800	217800	It's not as simple as that. It's a Lovecraft-inspired cosmic horror that has devoured God knows how much of the universe.
217800	220800	And we are just another step along its path.
220800	224800	And how can we stop something that we don't even understand?
224800	229800	What power do we possess in the face of this utterly incomprehensible terror?
229800	231800	But this thing is not a thing.
231800	237800	Each cell is its own entity with its own will to survive, and part of surviving is camouflage.
237800	243800	But because it can assume the form of everything it has consumed, we're given grotesque creations.
243800	248800	Amalgamations of man, beast, and something else, blending body horror with science fiction.
248800	253800	Rob Bottin, who was only 23 at the time but had previously worked with Carpenter on The Fog,
253800	258800	pitched the idea to Carpenter that the monster could be anything, and Carpenter ran with it.
258800	264800	What ensued was about 14 months of working 7 days a week in order to create all the models used in the movie,
264800	267800	which also meant lots and lots of latex.
267800	271800	With these creatures, they were pushing the limits of special effects at the time,
271800	275800	but even so, if you were to look at any of the monsters in even lighting, they would look fake.
275800	278800	Rob Bottin and his crew might have created these horrors,
278800	283800	but cinematographer Dean Cundey brought them to life by masking their imperfections in shadow,
283800	288800	and using contrasty and moody lighting to add another layer of dread and fear to their presence.
288800	293800	Each one of these latex abominations was life-sized, apart from a couple miniature shots,
293800	299800	and incredibly detailed, causing them to lag behind the rest of the production as you can probably imagine.
299800	304800	Most of, but not all of the shots of the various incarnations of The Thing were filmed after the movie wrapped.
304800	309800	Carpenter covered the scenes appropriately so that he could fit the shots of the aliens into the movie,
309800	314800	but that led to many of the actors not actually knowing what The Thing looked like until they saw the film.
314800	315800	Clear!
318800	320800	And I think that that actually helped the film,
320800	326800	because as disgusting and as horrific as the monsters are, the true horror of The Thing is psychological.
326800	333800	Who can you trust? Who is infected? Can you even trust yourself?
333800	336800	At the beginning of the movie, MacCready plays chess with the computer.
336800	339800	The computer always knows the best move, so it wins.
339800	345800	But MacCready enacts his revenge by pouring his whiskey into the computer, frying it.
345800	347800	It's a microcosm for the film as a whole.
347800	352800	MacCready plays a game of chess with The Thing, and every man at the station is a piece on the board.
352800	356800	The psychological horror emerges out of this cosmic game of wits.
356800	360800	And, spoiler alert, the film ends just like how the chess game ended.
360800	366800	Alright, now let's see who here is an imposter.
369800	370800	Get away from me!
371800	378800	Despite being a monster from out of this world, The Thing manages to be disturbingly realistic in its execution.
378800	381800	This trait is mirrored by the protagonists as well.
381800	384800	The film was initially criticized for a lack of strong characters,
384800	389800	but the relatively simple demeanor of the cast only adds to the overall tension and atmosphere.
389800	396800	The juxtaposition of any ordinary character revealing themselves as an incomprehensible monster is what creates the suspense.
396800	400800	It's for this reason why something like the blood test scene is so compelling.
400800	405800	The lack of specific character development actually helps the story remain unpredictable.
405800	411800	The individual characters are not relevant to the overall premise because The Thing is not a character-driven film.
411800	417800	You could have told the same story with Siberian prison guards or Area 51 agents and it wouldn't have made a difference.
417800	424800	The Thing functions much better as an allegory, with each character representing a different archetype of how people act in crisis.
424800	429800	Just as the monster is not inherently evil, the crew are not inherently heroic.
429800	433800	MacReady, the main protagonist, murders an innocent crew member.
436800	440800	That clock was human, huh? Which makes you a murderer, don't it?
440800	445800	He becomes the de facto leader of the group not because he is the most virtuous or sensible,
445800	448800	but because he is the most paranoid and brazen.
448800	451800	Anybody touches me, here we go.
451800	455800	Some critics question the lack of group cohesion among the crew,
455800	459800	finding it implausible that the men did not band together to defeat The Thing.
459800	462800	Contrary to the idealistic whims of the 80s audience,
462800	468800	the film presents a fairly accurate portrayal of how real people tend to act in conflict.
468800	474800	There is overwhelming historical precedent to suggest that people become increasingly atomized while under duress.
474800	479800	Everyone dreams of a gallant hero swooping in to magically solve all of our problems,
479800	483800	but in reality our only salvation comes from men like MacReady,
483800	487800	those who have no choice but to pick the least terrible option.
487800	491800	They will be met with fire and fury.
494800	499800	The Thing could be described by some as prophetic with its portrayal of paranoid isolation,
499800	502800	but its themes undoubtedly echo the real-world events of the time.
502800	505800	The early 80s saw the rise of the AIDS epidemic,
505800	510800	a mysterious and incurable virus whose carriers were indistinguishable from the average person.
510800	514800	The social reaction to the virus was far from cohesive.
514800	517800	The infected were ostracized and abandoned by their communities.
517800	521800	Gays and other minority groups faced unjust discrimination.
521800	527800	People and governments neglected the epidemic until it started affecting the most illustrious members of society.
527800	532800	By the end of the 80s, three-quarters of a million people were infected in the US alone.
532800	537800	In hindsight, did our society really handle things that much better than MacReady?
537800	540800	I don't know who to trust.
540800	543800	Trust is a tough thing to come by these days.
543800	547800	A more broad inspiration for The Thing was the prevailing Cold War.
547800	551800	The collapse of group harmony draws immediate parallels to the Red Scare,
551800	556800	which tore apart American communities by injecting paranoia over communist sympathizers.
556800	560800	The Thing more subtly alludes to the threat of mutually assured destruction.
560800	567800	MacReady is so determined to defeat the monster that he no longer values the preservation of himself or the crew.
567800	569800	We're not getting out of here alive.
569800	571800	But neither is that thing.
574800	577800	The film literally ends with a fiery mushroom cloud
577800	581800	and the two remaining crew members resigning themselves to a mutual demise.
581800	587800	Just one year after the film's release, a lone Soviet officer would save us from meeting the same fate.
587800	593800	Perhaps the most frightening aspect of The Thing is not the monster, but the horrors of human nature itself.
593800	596800	Paranoia, mistrust, isolation and assimilation.
596800	601800	The film has a lot to say about what compels us to turn against our fellow man.
601800	605800	How far do you have to push people before they justify homicidal acts?
605800	611800	The zombie genre tends to depict homicide by portraying the infected as physically and mentally corrupted.
611800	615800	In many aspects, a zombie has lost the traits which make it human,
615800	619800	and the protagonist can indiscriminately slaughter them without remorse.
619800	624800	The Thing complicates this premise by making the infected identical in appearance to the rest of the crew.
624800	629800	Many crew members at first experience guilt or hesitation upon killing the mimic
629800	633800	because they are unable to truly separate the image of their peers from the monster.
633800	638800	MacReady, I know bad things. I've known him for ten years. He's my friend.
638800	640800	You gotta burn the rest of him.
640800	646800	Only MacReady, the least empathetic character, is able to dispatch the infected with confidence.
646800	653800	But ironically, in acting without emotional attachment, the crew gradually begin to lose touch with their own humanity.
653800	659800	Just as the monster learns to act more human, the humans begin to act more like the monster.
659800	666800	If it takes us over, then it has no more enemies.
666800	671800	Nobody left to kill it. And then it's won.
671800	676800	Biologically speaking, a virus is not classified as a living thing.
676800	682800	Despite posing a major threat to life, viruses are entirely dependent on life to propagate.
682800	689800	In a similar sense, ideas, beliefs, and perceptions can only really exist within the host of the human mind.
689800	695800	The film becomes perhaps the most fascinating when you view the monster as a metaphor for ideology.
695800	702800	The disgusting appearance of The Thing may serve as a representation of the ugliness we see in opposing belief systems.
702800	710800	The very same psychological effects experienced by the fictional crew have been used to justify some of the worst atrocities that mankind has ever witnessed.
710800	716800	Somebody in this camp ain't what he appears to be. Right now, that may be one or two of us. By spring, it could be all of us.
716800	719800	There exists a latent theme of purity within The Thing.
719800	724800	Each piece of the infected material serves as a functional part of the entire alien being.
724800	730800	Maybe every part of him was a whole. Every little piece was an individual animal.
730800	734800	If a small particle of this thing is enough to take over an entire organism...
734800	741800	Conversely, each crew member seeks to retain purity from the monster, or risk allowing the healthy to become corrupted.
741800	747800	This echoes how fanatical ideologues relinquish their individuality to serve a greater vision of society.
747800	752800	Those who do not align with the vision must either be assimilated or exterminated.
752800	756800	The opposing ideologies are doomed to wage war until only the pure survive.
756800	761800	At the end of it all, MacCready and Child sit face to face as the two remaining survivors.
761800	769800	After all the violence and destruction, neither the protagonist nor the audience are any closer to figuring out who The Thing really is.
769800	774800	The two survivors are utterly paralyzed, not by fear, but by total mistrust.
774800	779800	It is through this situation which the film truly hammers in its most compelling theme...
779800	780800	Isolation.
780800	785800	Even though the characters have found each other in this moment, each has never felt more alone.
785800	789800	From the very beginning, the film establishes a paradox of isolation.
789800	794800	Separating people from others simultaneously makes them more safe and more vulnerable.
794800	802800	To protect human civilization from an apocalyptic pandemic, Blair has no choice but to isolate the crew from the outside world entirely.
802800	806800	But in doing so, leaves them with no reinforcements in fighting the monster.
806800	813800	When MacCready and the rest of the crew quarantine Blair, they ensure their temporary safety while creating a future vulnerability.
813800	818800	Within a group there's strength in numbers, but also a greater risk of being in the presence of the monster.
818800	824800	When splitting up, the monster is less likely to be present, but has a much easier way to attack.
824800	831800	As the characters descend further into paranoid hysteria, they become mentally and emotionally isolated from one another.
831800	835800	Making it more difficult for anyone to cooperate and defeat the monster.
835800	837800	Nobody trusts anybody now.
839800	843800	We're all very tired. There's nothing else I can do.
844800	845800	Just wait.
845800	852800	The final scene of The Thing has sparked numerous theories over which of the men could be infected, or whether any of them are infected at all.
852800	857800	Lead actor Kurt Russell interjected that analyzing the scene in this way is missing the point.
857800	864800	And that the ambiguity of the ending is a rhetorical device designed to make the audience just as paranoid as the characters on screen.
864800	870800	By the end of the film, we, just like MacCready and Childs, have absolutely nothing but doubt.
870800	875800	Only through total mistrust can we achieve a state of profound isolation.
875800	880800	When you lose all faith in the world around you, you become nothing more than a prisoner in your own mind.
887800	888800	Hey Blair!
891800	893800	Blair, have you seen Fuchs?
893800	898800	My favorite scene in the movie is when MacCready goes to check on Blair after quarantining him.
898800	907800	There's just something so unsettling about Blair calmly and uncharacteristically asking to be let back in the base as a noose ominously dangles in front of him.
907800	913800	There's no action, violence, or immediate threat to the characters. It just feels off.
913800	918800	As a viewer, this moment for me represents the psychological point of no return.
918800	926800	Beyond this, we have officially crossed the event horizon of uncertainty, where no character is trustworthy until proven otherwise.
926800	933800	Has Blair really calmed down? Has he succumbed to the madness entirely? Is he an imitation trying to act human?
933800	937800	What if MacCready is an imitation and he's just leaving an innocent man to die?
937800	940800	So many questions, so little time.
940800	945800	For me, this scene perfectly captures why The Thing is such a remarkable film.
945800	948800	And its calmest moments manage to be utterly terrifying.
951800	955800	Human intellect is capable of feats unprecedented to the rest of nature.
955800	961800	Our unique abilities to reason and ask questions has allowed us to utterly dominate the natural world.
961800	966800	However, these same abilities also present us with a unique challenge in self-destruction.
966800	972800	We can survive in climates inhospitable to nearly all other forms of life, but can we survive each other?
972800	976800	Both viruses and ideology challenge the mastery of our domain.
976800	984800	We have transcended the animal kingdom to such an extent that we have mostly lost sight of how it feels to be threatened by the world around us.
984800	990800	Films like The Thing provide us with a disturbing glimpse into just how close we may be to the edge of control.
990800	995800	The film is truly unnerving because it reminds us of the darkest parts of ourselves.
995800	1001800	The primary reason for the film aging so well is that we are now more paranoid and isolated than ever before.
1001800	1006800	Watching it back today, The Thing appears much more realistic than nihilistic.
1006800	1011800	How many of us now are locked in an endless confrontation with our own version of The Thing?
1011800	1017800	Ironically, while the far more popular films of its era have mostly faded from the public consciousness,
1017800	1024800	the robust themes of The Thing remain just as relevant today, nearly 40 years since its inception.
1024800	1028800	My blood from one of you things won't obey when it's attacked.
1028800	1030800	It'll try and survive.
1034800	1039800	In the long run, The Thing managed to outlast both the competition and the critics.
1039800	1044800	Its initial negative reception may go down as one of the most baffling trends in film criticism.
1044800	1051800	Sadly, The Thing's lackluster release would spark the beginning of the end for John Carpenter's career as a blockbuster director.
1051800	1056800	The hostile audience response to the film derailed Carpenter's directorial confidence,
1056800	1060800	and he struggled to find much commercial or critical success after this point.
1060800	1068800	After rewatching the film on home video, audiences gradually warmed up to The Thing, and the film developed a cult following.
1068800	1074800	It has since been reassessed as a masterpiece in the horror genre, with some calling it Carpenter's best work.
1074800	1079800	Today, The Thing lives on in a new generation of creative work which carries on its legacy.
1079800	1086800	The concept of an alien imposter infiltrating a small community continues to thrive as a compelling psychological exercise.
1086800	1095800	And now, as we all confront the perils of a quarantined world, one has to wonder just how much of the movie will cross over into reality.
1095800	1103800	So with each passing year, as everyone gets a little less trusting and a little more isolated, just remember to stay safe out there.
1103800	1114800	Alright guys, you know the plan. We hang out here, and when the murderer shows up, that's when we attack.
1114800	1121800	How are we gonna know that he's the murderer? Well, he'll usually let you know that he's a murderer before he kills you.
1121800	1123800	So we just wait here?
1123800	1126800	Yep.
