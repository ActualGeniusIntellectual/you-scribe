00:00.000 --> 00:02.000
Brought to you by Manscaped.

00:04.800 --> 00:08.800
It's once again that time of the year when we revisit the horror genre,

00:08.800 --> 00:14.600
and few movies are as horrifying as John Carpenter's 1982 film, The Thing.

00:14.600 --> 00:20.000
The story of an unstoppable virus plunging a small community into total isolation.

00:20.000 --> 00:26.200
As you can probably tell, it's a film that was remarkably ahead of its time, almost to its own detriment.

00:26.200 --> 00:32.200
While the film is universally acclaimed today, audiences in 1982 initially hated it.

00:32.200 --> 00:38.400
A combination of poor marketing and stiff competition doomed the film to a lackluster theatrical release.

00:38.400 --> 00:43.600
The Thing went head-to-head with Blade Runner in the sci-fi department and Poltergeist in the horror department,

00:43.600 --> 00:46.000
losing out to both at the box office.

00:46.000 --> 00:52.800
But perhaps the biggest obstacle in the way of its success was the highest-grossing film of 1982, E.T.

00:52.800 --> 00:59.600
As yet another film depicting an encounter with alien life, E.T. served as the direct antithesis to The Thing.

00:59.600 --> 01:04.200
At the time, the U.S. was in the midst of its worst recession since World War II,

01:04.200 --> 01:11.800
and audiences gravitated more towards the whimsical escapism of E.T., with nationwide unemployment surpassing 10%.

01:11.800 --> 01:16.400
Moviegoers were not thrilled with the gloomy, nihilistic overtones of The Thing.

01:16.400 --> 01:21.800
Even more hostile than the audience were the critics, who slammed the film with negative reviews.

01:21.800 --> 01:27.600
Most of the discussion was fixated on the movie's most identifiable element, the special effects.

01:27.600 --> 01:32.600
The Thing featured some of the most innovative and unique creature effects of any film in history,

01:32.600 --> 01:37.400
nearly all of which were conceived and implemented by prosthetic makeup artist Rob Bettine.

01:37.400 --> 01:44.600
$1.5 million of the film's budget was spent on the creature effects, and the result was as impressive as it was gruesome.

01:44.600 --> 01:50.800
In the age before computer graphics, all of the effects had to be done practically, using real models and materials.

01:50.800 --> 01:56.200
Up to 50 technicians operated the models through a system of hydraulics, gases, and wires.

01:56.200 --> 02:02.800
The project was so ambitious that Bettine worked over a year without a single day off while living entirely out of the studio.

02:02.800 --> 02:09.800
At one point, he was even hospitalized for exhaustion, suffering numerous medical ailments from the sheer stress of the workload.

02:09.800 --> 02:14.800
For the filmmakers, the finished product represented a remarkable technical achievement.

02:14.800 --> 02:20.800
But for audiences, the effects were so shockingly grotesque that they overshadowed the greater philosophy of the film.

02:20.800 --> 02:27.600
Critics tended to treat the effects as an excessive gimmick, suggesting that the rest of the movie had very little to offer.

02:27.600 --> 02:36.800
While mostly derided as overkill at the time, the effects were entirely necessary to establish perhaps the most important aspect of the film, the monster.

02:36.800 --> 02:50.800
Hello, Kino Corner here. I'm currently in Antarctica, and there's a dog on the loose who I think might actually be an alien.

02:50.800 --> 02:53.800
Look! There he is!

02:53.800 --> 02:59.800
This monster, this alien, is not some little green man.

02:59.800 --> 03:05.800
It came to Earth on a flying saucer, but that's where the similarities with our normal conception of aliens ends.

03:05.800 --> 03:10.800
And it definitely diverges from the man in a rubber suit alien in the original version of The Thing.

03:10.800 --> 03:14.800
This alien is us. Or at least, it appears to be.

03:14.800 --> 03:21.800
Really, it's everything that it's ever encountered over at least tens of thousands of years of existence across multiple planets.

03:21.800 --> 03:24.800
It goes beyond being just a simple mimic.

03:24.800 --> 03:30.800
This isn't like Invasion of the Body Snatchers, where people are just replaced by identical but alien versions of themselves.

03:30.800 --> 03:37.800
It's not as simple as that. It's a Lovecraft-inspired cosmic horror that has devoured God knows how much of the universe.

03:37.800 --> 03:40.800
And we are just another step along its path.

03:40.800 --> 03:44.800
And how can we stop something that we don't even understand?

03:44.800 --> 03:49.800
What power do we possess in the face of this utterly incomprehensible terror?

03:49.800 --> 03:51.800
But this thing is not a thing.

03:51.800 --> 03:57.800
Each cell is its own entity with its own will to survive, and part of surviving is camouflage.

03:57.800 --> 04:03.800
But because it can assume the form of everything it has consumed, we're given grotesque creations.

04:03.800 --> 04:08.800
Amalgamations of man, beast, and something else, blending body horror with science fiction.

04:08.800 --> 04:13.800
Rob Bottin, who was only 23 at the time but had previously worked with Carpenter on The Fog,

04:13.800 --> 04:18.800
pitched the idea to Carpenter that the monster could be anything, and Carpenter ran with it.

04:18.800 --> 04:24.800
What ensued was about 14 months of working 7 days a week in order to create all the models used in the movie,

04:24.800 --> 04:27.800
which also meant lots and lots of latex.

04:27.800 --> 04:31.800
With these creatures, they were pushing the limits of special effects at the time,

04:31.800 --> 04:35.800
but even so, if you were to look at any of the monsters in even lighting, they would look fake.

04:35.800 --> 04:38.800
Rob Bottin and his crew might have created these horrors,

04:38.800 --> 04:43.800
but cinematographer Dean Cundey brought them to life by masking their imperfections in shadow,

04:43.800 --> 04:48.800
and using contrasty and moody lighting to add another layer of dread and fear to their presence.

04:48.800 --> 04:53.800
Each one of these latex abominations was life-sized, apart from a couple miniature shots,

04:53.800 --> 04:59.800
and incredibly detailed, causing them to lag behind the rest of the production as you can probably imagine.

04:59.800 --> 05:04.800
Most of, but not all of the shots of the various incarnations of The Thing were filmed after the movie wrapped.

05:04.800 --> 05:09.800
Carpenter covered the scenes appropriately so that he could fit the shots of the aliens into the movie,

05:09.800 --> 05:14.800
but that led to many of the actors not actually knowing what The Thing looked like until they saw the film.

05:14.800 --> 05:15.800
Clear!

05:18.800 --> 05:20.800
And I think that that actually helped the film,

05:20.800 --> 05:26.800
because as disgusting and as horrific as the monsters are, the true horror of The Thing is psychological.

05:26.800 --> 05:33.800
Who can you trust? Who is infected? Can you even trust yourself?

05:33.800 --> 05:36.800
At the beginning of the movie, MacCready plays chess with the computer.

05:36.800 --> 05:39.800
The computer always knows the best move, so it wins.

05:39.800 --> 05:45.800
But MacCready enacts his revenge by pouring his whiskey into the computer, frying it.

05:45.800 --> 05:47.800
It's a microcosm for the film as a whole.

05:47.800 --> 05:52.800
MacCready plays a game of chess with The Thing, and every man at the station is a piece on the board.

05:52.800 --> 05:56.800
The psychological horror emerges out of this cosmic game of wits.

05:56.800 --> 06:00.800
And, spoiler alert, the film ends just like how the chess game ended.

06:00.800 --> 06:06.800
Alright, now let's see who here is an imposter.

06:09.800 --> 06:10.800
Get away from me!

06:11.800 --> 06:18.800
Despite being a monster from out of this world, The Thing manages to be disturbingly realistic in its execution.

06:18.800 --> 06:21.800
This trait is mirrored by the protagonists as well.

06:21.800 --> 06:24.800
The film was initially criticized for a lack of strong characters,

06:24.800 --> 06:29.800
but the relatively simple demeanor of the cast only adds to the overall tension and atmosphere.

06:29.800 --> 06:36.800
The juxtaposition of any ordinary character revealing themselves as an incomprehensible monster is what creates the suspense.

06:36.800 --> 06:40.800
It's for this reason why something like the blood test scene is so compelling.

06:40.800 --> 06:45.800
The lack of specific character development actually helps the story remain unpredictable.

06:45.800 --> 06:51.800
The individual characters are not relevant to the overall premise because The Thing is not a character-driven film.

06:51.800 --> 06:57.800
You could have told the same story with Siberian prison guards or Area 51 agents and it wouldn't have made a difference.

06:57.800 --> 07:04.800
The Thing functions much better as an allegory, with each character representing a different archetype of how people act in crisis.

07:04.800 --> 07:09.800
Just as the monster is not inherently evil, the crew are not inherently heroic.

07:09.800 --> 07:13.800
MacReady, the main protagonist, murders an innocent crew member.

07:16.800 --> 07:20.800
That clock was human, huh? Which makes you a murderer, don't it?

07:20.800 --> 07:25.800
He becomes the de facto leader of the group not because he is the most virtuous or sensible,

07:25.800 --> 07:28.800
but because he is the most paranoid and brazen.

07:28.800 --> 07:31.800
Anybody touches me, here we go.

07:31.800 --> 07:35.800
Some critics question the lack of group cohesion among the crew,

07:35.800 --> 07:39.800
finding it implausible that the men did not band together to defeat The Thing.

07:39.800 --> 07:42.800
Contrary to the idealistic whims of the 80s audience,

07:42.800 --> 07:48.800
the film presents a fairly accurate portrayal of how real people tend to act in conflict.

07:48.800 --> 07:54.800
There is overwhelming historical precedent to suggest that people become increasingly atomized while under duress.

07:54.800 --> 07:59.800
Everyone dreams of a gallant hero swooping in to magically solve all of our problems,

07:59.800 --> 08:03.800
but in reality our only salvation comes from men like MacReady,

08:03.800 --> 08:07.800
those who have no choice but to pick the least terrible option.

08:07.800 --> 08:11.800
They will be met with fire and fury.

08:14.800 --> 08:19.800
The Thing could be described by some as prophetic with its portrayal of paranoid isolation,

08:19.800 --> 08:22.800
but its themes undoubtedly echo the real-world events of the time.

08:22.800 --> 08:25.800
The early 80s saw the rise of the AIDS epidemic,

08:25.800 --> 08:30.800
a mysterious and incurable virus whose carriers were indistinguishable from the average person.

08:30.800 --> 08:34.800
The social reaction to the virus was far from cohesive.

08:34.800 --> 08:37.800
The infected were ostracized and abandoned by their communities.

08:37.800 --> 08:41.800
Gays and other minority groups faced unjust discrimination.

08:41.800 --> 08:47.800
People and governments neglected the epidemic until it started affecting the most illustrious members of society.

08:47.800 --> 08:52.800
By the end of the 80s, three-quarters of a million people were infected in the US alone.

08:52.800 --> 08:57.800
In hindsight, did our society really handle things that much better than MacReady?

08:57.800 --> 09:00.800
I don't know who to trust.

09:00.800 --> 09:03.800
Trust is a tough thing to come by these days.

09:03.800 --> 09:07.800
A more broad inspiration for The Thing was the prevailing Cold War.

09:07.800 --> 09:11.800
The collapse of group harmony draws immediate parallels to the Red Scare,

09:11.800 --> 09:16.800
which tore apart American communities by injecting paranoia over communist sympathizers.

09:16.800 --> 09:20.800
The Thing more subtly alludes to the threat of mutually assured destruction.

09:20.800 --> 09:27.800
MacReady is so determined to defeat the monster that he no longer values the preservation of himself or the crew.

09:27.800 --> 09:29.800
We're not getting out of here alive.

09:29.800 --> 09:31.800
But neither is that thing.

09:34.800 --> 09:37.800
The film literally ends with a fiery mushroom cloud

09:37.800 --> 09:41.800
and the two remaining crew members resigning themselves to a mutual demise.

09:41.800 --> 09:47.800
Just one year after the film's release, a lone Soviet officer would save us from meeting the same fate.

09:47.800 --> 09:53.800
Perhaps the most frightening aspect of The Thing is not the monster, but the horrors of human nature itself.

09:53.800 --> 09:56.800
Paranoia, mistrust, isolation and assimilation.

09:56.800 --> 10:01.800
The film has a lot to say about what compels us to turn against our fellow man.

10:01.800 --> 10:05.800
How far do you have to push people before they justify homicidal acts?

10:05.800 --> 10:11.800
The zombie genre tends to depict homicide by portraying the infected as physically and mentally corrupted.

10:11.800 --> 10:15.800
In many aspects, a zombie has lost the traits which make it human,

10:15.800 --> 10:19.800
and the protagonist can indiscriminately slaughter them without remorse.

10:19.800 --> 10:24.800
The Thing complicates this premise by making the infected identical in appearance to the rest of the crew.

10:24.800 --> 10:29.800
Many crew members at first experience guilt or hesitation upon killing the mimic

10:29.800 --> 10:33.800
because they are unable to truly separate the image of their peers from the monster.

10:33.800 --> 10:38.800
MacReady, I know bad things. I've known him for ten years. He's my friend.

10:38.800 --> 10:40.800
You gotta burn the rest of him.

10:40.800 --> 10:46.800
Only MacReady, the least empathetic character, is able to dispatch the infected with confidence.

10:46.800 --> 10:53.800
But ironically, in acting without emotional attachment, the crew gradually begin to lose touch with their own humanity.

10:53.800 --> 10:59.800
Just as the monster learns to act more human, the humans begin to act more like the monster.

10:59.800 --> 11:06.800
If it takes us over, then it has no more enemies.

11:06.800 --> 11:11.800
Nobody left to kill it. And then it's won.

11:11.800 --> 11:16.800
Biologically speaking, a virus is not classified as a living thing.

11:16.800 --> 11:22.800
Despite posing a major threat to life, viruses are entirely dependent on life to propagate.

11:22.800 --> 11:29.800
In a similar sense, ideas, beliefs, and perceptions can only really exist within the host of the human mind.

11:29.800 --> 11:35.800
The film becomes perhaps the most fascinating when you view the monster as a metaphor for ideology.

11:35.800 --> 11:42.800
The disgusting appearance of The Thing may serve as a representation of the ugliness we see in opposing belief systems.

11:42.800 --> 11:50.800
The very same psychological effects experienced by the fictional crew have been used to justify some of the worst atrocities that mankind has ever witnessed.

11:50.800 --> 11:56.800
Somebody in this camp ain't what he appears to be. Right now, that may be one or two of us. By spring, it could be all of us.

11:56.800 --> 11:59.800
There exists a latent theme of purity within The Thing.

11:59.800 --> 12:04.800
Each piece of the infected material serves as a functional part of the entire alien being.

12:04.800 --> 12:10.800
Maybe every part of him was a whole. Every little piece was an individual animal.

12:10.800 --> 12:14.800
If a small particle of this thing is enough to take over an entire organism...

12:14.800 --> 12:21.800
Conversely, each crew member seeks to retain purity from the monster, or risk allowing the healthy to become corrupted.

12:21.800 --> 12:27.800
This echoes how fanatical ideologues relinquish their individuality to serve a greater vision of society.

12:27.800 --> 12:32.800
Those who do not align with the vision must either be assimilated or exterminated.

12:32.800 --> 12:36.800
The opposing ideologies are doomed to wage war until only the pure survive.

12:36.800 --> 12:41.800
At the end of it all, MacCready and Child sit face to face as the two remaining survivors.

12:41.800 --> 12:49.800
After all the violence and destruction, neither the protagonist nor the audience are any closer to figuring out who The Thing really is.

12:49.800 --> 12:54.800
The two survivors are utterly paralyzed, not by fear, but by total mistrust.

12:54.800 --> 12:59.800
It is through this situation which the film truly hammers in its most compelling theme...

12:59.800 --> 13:00.800
Isolation.

13:00.800 --> 13:05.800
Even though the characters have found each other in this moment, each has never felt more alone.

13:05.800 --> 13:09.800
From the very beginning, the film establishes a paradox of isolation.

13:09.800 --> 13:14.800
Separating people from others simultaneously makes them more safe and more vulnerable.

13:14.800 --> 13:22.800
To protect human civilization from an apocalyptic pandemic, Blair has no choice but to isolate the crew from the outside world entirely.

13:22.800 --> 13:26.800
But in doing so, leaves them with no reinforcements in fighting the monster.

13:26.800 --> 13:33.800
When MacCready and the rest of the crew quarantine Blair, they ensure their temporary safety while creating a future vulnerability.

13:33.800 --> 13:38.800
Within a group there's strength in numbers, but also a greater risk of being in the presence of the monster.

13:38.800 --> 13:44.800
When splitting up, the monster is less likely to be present, but has a much easier way to attack.

13:44.800 --> 13:51.800
As the characters descend further into paranoid hysteria, they become mentally and emotionally isolated from one another.

13:51.800 --> 13:55.800
Making it more difficult for anyone to cooperate and defeat the monster.

13:55.800 --> 13:57.800
Nobody trusts anybody now.

13:59.800 --> 14:03.800
We're all very tired. There's nothing else I can do.

14:04.800 --> 14:05.800
Just wait.

14:05.800 --> 14:12.800
The final scene of The Thing has sparked numerous theories over which of the men could be infected, or whether any of them are infected at all.

14:12.800 --> 14:17.800
Lead actor Kurt Russell interjected that analyzing the scene in this way is missing the point.

14:17.800 --> 14:24.800
And that the ambiguity of the ending is a rhetorical device designed to make the audience just as paranoid as the characters on screen.

14:24.800 --> 14:30.800
By the end of the film, we, just like MacCready and Childs, have absolutely nothing but doubt.

14:30.800 --> 14:35.800
Only through total mistrust can we achieve a state of profound isolation.

14:35.800 --> 14:40.800
When you lose all faith in the world around you, you become nothing more than a prisoner in your own mind.

14:47.800 --> 14:48.800
Hey Blair!

14:51.800 --> 14:53.800
Blair, have you seen Fuchs?

14:53.800 --> 14:58.800
My favorite scene in the movie is when MacCready goes to check on Blair after quarantining him.

14:58.800 --> 15:07.800
There's just something so unsettling about Blair calmly and uncharacteristically asking to be let back in the base as a noose ominously dangles in front of him.

15:07.800 --> 15:13.800
There's no action, violence, or immediate threat to the characters. It just feels off.

15:13.800 --> 15:18.800
As a viewer, this moment for me represents the psychological point of no return.

15:18.800 --> 15:26.800
Beyond this, we have officially crossed the event horizon of uncertainty, where no character is trustworthy until proven otherwise.

15:26.800 --> 15:33.800
Has Blair really calmed down? Has he succumbed to the madness entirely? Is he an imitation trying to act human?

15:33.800 --> 15:37.800
What if MacCready is an imitation and he's just leaving an innocent man to die?

15:37.800 --> 15:40.800
So many questions, so little time.

15:40.800 --> 15:45.800
For me, this scene perfectly captures why The Thing is such a remarkable film.

15:45.800 --> 15:48.800
And its calmest moments manage to be utterly terrifying.

15:51.800 --> 15:55.800
Human intellect is capable of feats unprecedented to the rest of nature.

15:55.800 --> 16:01.800
Our unique abilities to reason and ask questions has allowed us to utterly dominate the natural world.

16:01.800 --> 16:06.800
However, these same abilities also present us with a unique challenge in self-destruction.

16:06.800 --> 16:12.800
We can survive in climates inhospitable to nearly all other forms of life, but can we survive each other?

16:12.800 --> 16:16.800
Both viruses and ideology challenge the mastery of our domain.

16:16.800 --> 16:24.800
We have transcended the animal kingdom to such an extent that we have mostly lost sight of how it feels to be threatened by the world around us.

16:24.800 --> 16:30.800
Films like The Thing provide us with a disturbing glimpse into just how close we may be to the edge of control.

16:30.800 --> 16:35.800
The film is truly unnerving because it reminds us of the darkest parts of ourselves.

16:35.800 --> 16:41.800
The primary reason for the film aging so well is that we are now more paranoid and isolated than ever before.

16:41.800 --> 16:46.800
Watching it back today, The Thing appears much more realistic than nihilistic.

16:46.800 --> 16:51.800
How many of us now are locked in an endless confrontation with our own version of The Thing?

16:51.800 --> 16:57.800
Ironically, while the far more popular films of its era have mostly faded from the public consciousness,

16:57.800 --> 17:04.800
the robust themes of The Thing remain just as relevant today, nearly 40 years since its inception.

17:04.800 --> 17:08.800
My blood from one of you things won't obey when it's attacked.

17:08.800 --> 17:10.800
It'll try and survive.

17:14.800 --> 17:19.800
In the long run, The Thing managed to outlast both the competition and the critics.

17:19.800 --> 17:24.800
Its initial negative reception may go down as one of the most baffling trends in film criticism.

17:24.800 --> 17:31.800
Sadly, The Thing's lackluster release would spark the beginning of the end for John Carpenter's career as a blockbuster director.

17:31.800 --> 17:36.800
The hostile audience response to the film derailed Carpenter's directorial confidence,

17:36.800 --> 17:40.800
and he struggled to find much commercial or critical success after this point.

17:40.800 --> 17:48.800
After rewatching the film on home video, audiences gradually warmed up to The Thing, and the film developed a cult following.

17:48.800 --> 17:54.800
It has since been reassessed as a masterpiece in the horror genre, with some calling it Carpenter's best work.

17:54.800 --> 17:59.800
Today, The Thing lives on in a new generation of creative work which carries on its legacy.

17:59.800 --> 18:06.800
The concept of an alien imposter infiltrating a small community continues to thrive as a compelling psychological exercise.

18:06.800 --> 18:15.800
And now, as we all confront the perils of a quarantined world, one has to wonder just how much of the movie will cross over into reality.

18:15.800 --> 18:23.800
So with each passing year, as everyone gets a little less trusting and a little more isolated, just remember to stay safe out there.

18:23.800 --> 18:34.800
Alright guys, you know the plan. We hang out here, and when the murderer shows up, that's when we attack.

18:34.800 --> 18:41.800
How are we gonna know that he's the murderer? Well, he'll usually let you know that he's a murderer before he kills you.

18:41.800 --> 18:43.800
So we just wait here?

18:43.800 --> 18:46.800
Yep.

18:47.800 --> 18:55.800

Recently, many of us have seen our personal grooming get out of control. I am declaring a pubic health emergency.

19:08.800 --> 19:12.800
It's time to break open the performance package kit.

19:13.800 --> 19:16.800
