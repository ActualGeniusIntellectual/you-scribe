1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:11,360
This is a meme that raises far more questions than answers.

2
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:14,960
It's supposed to be this deep-fried, obscure, ironic meme,

3
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:18,880
yet it has seen widespread use and even some media coverage.

4
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:22,720
It's yet another installment in the series of one-letter memes.

5
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:26,640
B, H, T-pose, press F to pay respects.

6
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:32,480
Have memes become so saturated that we have resorted to using letters of the alphabet for comedy?

7
00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:38,800
Or maybe these memes are just an ironic satire of the brain-numbing simplicity of modern mainstream memes.

8
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:42,640
Perhaps E is one of the first widespread cases of an anti-meme,

9
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:46,800
a pointless non-sequitur that's only designed to cause confusion and delay.

10
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:48,960
Or maybe it's the complete opposite.

11
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:53,280
Maybe E represents the absolute peak performance of a meme,

12
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:57,280
condensing an incredibly complex idea into a single letter.

13
00:00:57,280 --> 00:01:02,000
Whatever the cause, this meme has redefined what can be considered a meme,

14
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:09,440
and internet humor will never be the same.
