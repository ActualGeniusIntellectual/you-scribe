00:00.000 --> 00:11.360
This is a meme that raises far more questions than answers.

00:11.360 --> 00:14.960
It's supposed to be this deep-fried, obscure, ironic meme,

00:14.960 --> 00:18.880
yet it has seen widespread use and even some media coverage.

00:18.880 --> 00:22.720
It's yet another installment in the series of one-letter memes.

00:22.720 --> 00:26.640
B, H, T-pose, press F to pay respects.

00:26.640 --> 00:32.480
Have memes become so saturated that we have resorted to using letters of the alphabet for comedy?

00:32.480 --> 00:38.800
Or maybe these memes are just an ironic satire of the brain-numbing simplicity of modern mainstream memes.

00:38.800 --> 00:42.640
Perhaps E is one of the first widespread cases of an anti-meme,

00:42.640 --> 00:46.800
a pointless non-sequitur that's only designed to cause confusion and delay.

00:46.800 --> 00:48.960
Or maybe it's the complete opposite.

00:48.960 --> 00:53.280
Maybe E represents the absolute peak performance of a meme,

00:53.280 --> 00:57.280
condensing an incredibly complex idea into a single letter.

00:57.280 --> 01:02.000
Whatever the cause, this meme has redefined what can be considered a meme,

01:02.000 --> 01:09.440
and internet humor will never be the same.
