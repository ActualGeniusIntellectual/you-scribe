0	11360	This is a meme that raises far more questions than answers.
11360	14960	It's supposed to be this deep-fried, obscure, ironic meme,
14960	18880	yet it has seen widespread use and even some media coverage.
18880	22720	It's yet another installment in the series of one-letter memes.
22720	26640	B, H, T-pose, press F to pay respects.
26640	32480	Have memes become so saturated that we have resorted to using letters of the alphabet for comedy?
32480	38800	Or maybe these memes are just an ironic satire of the brain-numbing simplicity of modern mainstream memes.
38800	42640	Perhaps E is one of the first widespread cases of an anti-meme,
42640	46800	a pointless non-sequitur that's only designed to cause confusion and delay.
46800	48960	Or maybe it's the complete opposite.
48960	53280	Maybe E represents the absolute peak performance of a meme,
53280	57280	condensing an incredibly complex idea into a single letter.
57280	62000	Whatever the cause, this meme has redefined what can be considered a meme,
62000	69440	and internet humor will never be the same.
