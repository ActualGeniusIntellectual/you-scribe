0	3780	YouTube is a vast ocean of content.
3780	8820	Every 60 seconds, YouTubers produce over 400 hours of videos.
8820	12320	That's about 17 days of videos per minute.
12320	16660	You could spend the rest of your life watching nothing but new YouTube videos
16660	21560	and you'll only watch 1 24,000th of all there is to see.
21560	24720	Just imagine everything that you don't see.
24720	28700	Imagine everything out there just waiting to be found.
28740	32900	Behind every video is a person, a story, a legacy.
32900	35640	So let's go out and explore it.
35640	39740	Welcome everyone to YouTube Geographic.
58700	68280	And since this is the beginning of a new series, we're going to start it off from the beginning of YouTube.
68280	73720	That's right, today we're going to explore the first video uploaded to YouTube, me at the zoo.
73720	77420	Alright, so here we are in front of the elephants.
77420	86360	The cool thing about these guys is that they have really, really, really long trunks.
86360	88360	And that's cool.
90560	93060	And that's pretty much all there is to say.
93060	97540	The first video on YouTube was not very impressive.
97540	102380	It's a 240p, 18 second video of a guy talking about elephants.
102380	107440	If this video existed in any other context, it would be completely forgettable.
107440	108440	But it doesn't.
108440	112420	And believe it or not, this is actually a very important video.
112420	115220	Even more important than important videos.
115220	120460	And in order to understand why it's so important, we must first understand its background.
120460	121820	Let's start with the uploader.
121820	122720	This guy.
122720	124420	His name is Jawed Karim.
124420	127160	He's one of the co-founders of YouTube.com.
127160	131600	Karim has gone on the record and said that his original inspiration for creating YouTube
131600	135460	was to find clips of Janet Jackson's Super Bowl wardrobe malfunction,
135460	138100	which he couldn't find anywhere else on the web.
138100	144540	Twelve years later, and YouTube is still a great resource for people trying to find clips of boobies.
144560	148800	But more importantly, it speaks to one of YouTube's greatest utilities.
148800	153380	YouTube has truly become one of the biggest video archives on the internet.
153380	157740	Before YouTube, the only way to find an obscure video clip was to scour the web
157740	160640	or track down an elusive VHS tape.
160640	163580	It's hard to even imagine something like that nowadays,
163580	167420	where everyone has a smartphone and can document any event of interest
167420	170260	and post it to social media in a matter of seconds.
170280	175320	It's almost impossible for any important event today to go undocumented.
175320	181260	But back in 2004, 90 million people saw Janet Jackson's exposed nipple live
181260	184200	and Jawed couldn't find any footage of it online.
184200	187260	Now, thanks to YouTube, we can see it.
187260	192740	Everyone can see it, along with a ton of other weird, obscure stuff that you never knew existed.
192740	195400	And that's something I really like about YouTube,
195420	200360	But it's not the reason why it's the most popular video streaming site in the world.
200360	203620	Sure, the archive stuff is really nice for lurkers like me,
203620	207560	but you don't get to a billion users by just being an archive.
207560	213240	There's something about YouTube, an intrinsic quality about it that draws people in.
213240	217740	Back in 2005, YouTube started off as just another Silicon Valley startup.
217740	222380	It opened in a humble office above two restaurants in a California city.
222400	227540	And just 18 months later, YouTube was the fifth most popular site on the internet,
227540	230580	earning more than 100 million views per day.
230580	232400	So what made YouTube so special?
232400	236080	And what set it apart from all the other video streaming sites on the web?
236080	240220	The answer, I believe, lies here in the very first video.
240220	243820	Me at the zoo may just be a video of an average guy doing an average thing,
243820	246820	but that's exactly why it's so important.
246840	250480	By uploading this as the first video on YouTube,
250480	252380	Josh set a precedent.
252380	257720	He laid down the cornerstone that would define the spirit of YouTube for years to come.
257720	261920	He established YouTube as a medium through which the common man
261920	265120	could broadcast themselves to the entire world.
265120	268260	YouTube was born as a site of the people.
268260	271960	It completely reversed decades of steeped media tradition.
271980	277080	Before YouTube, an ordinary person had no way of broadcasting their ideas,
277080	280520	thoughts, and actions to more than a handful of people.
280520	283820	YouTube granted the common man with great power,
283820	287820	a power that had only previously been available to celebrities,
287820	290000	movie stars, and rock stars.
290000	294100	Now, thanks to YouTube, anyone can be like a rock star.
294100	296960	And that's why people like YouTube so much.
296960	300200	We enjoy seeing people like us succeed.
300240	304580	We witness these average Joes get millions of hits and it gives us hope.
304580	307980	It gives us hope that if they can make it big,
307980	312220	then maybe, just maybe, we can too one day.
312220	315900	And that, I believe, is the true spirit of YouTube.
315900	317600	It's what drives us to try.
317600	319600	It's what drives us to improve.
319600	322500	It's what drives us to persist through thick and thin
322500	325300	and all the stupid obstacles that are in our way.
325300	330280	It's what drives us to compete head-on with channels a million times our size.
330280	334520	And even though at times it may feel like you have a better chance of getting rich off the lottery
334520	336580	than having one of your videos go viral,
336580	340920	you just keep trying because you're saying there's a chance.
340920	345560	And all of that is communicated through this 18-second video of a guy at the zoo.
345560	347300	Of course, this is all implied.
347300	349900	The guy is really only talking about elephants here.
349900	351400	But he does have a point.
351400	353500	Elephants do have pretty long trunks.
354500	358280	By the end of 2006, Google had purchased YouTube
358280	362280	and Jod earned $64 million worth of Google shares.
362280	363780	Under Google's ownership,
363780	367380	YouTube has gone through 11 years of countless updates and changes.
367380	372060	Yet through all of that, this video and this channel have persisted,
372060	376460	silently watching over the website that it kicked off all those years ago.
376460	379200	YouTube has changed quite a bit since Google took over
379200	383700	and it hasn't exactly been the most compatible with Jod's original vision.
383700	386500	One of the most infamous changes that you may remember
386500	390580	was the forced integration with Google+, a failed social network.
390580	392020	At the time of its announcement,
392020	394780	Jod actually made a rare post on his YouTube channel
394780	396880	to interject his displeasure for the change.
396880	399580	There's no doubt that forcing Google Plus on YouTubers
399580	402880	was one of the most unpopular decisions in the history of the site.
402880	404020	And for good reason.
404020	406920	They threatened to take away people's ability to comment.
406920	408920	Ah, yes, YouTube comments.
408940	411020	I think everyone just pretends to hate them,
411020	413280	when secretly, we all kind of like them.
413280	416020	They're such an essential part of the YouTube experience.
416020	418660	Me at the Zoo has about 300,000 comments.
418660	423200	And there's not really any other comment section like it on YouTube.
423200	426260	There aren't any flame wars or arguments going on.
426260	428000	There are just a few memes.
428000	431400	And memes have even managed to infiltrate the video's description.
431400	434880	But that aside, most of the people commenting are just in awe.
434880	436580	They're paying their respects
436580	440240	and leaving their mark on YouTube's oldest video.
440240	442880	And what we have created over 12 years of comments
442880	446120	is a complete slice of YouTube history.
446120	449220	If you go back through all those 300,000 comments,
449220	451760	it'll be like traveling back in time.
451760	455020	You will see a complete chronology of ideas,
455020	458520	trends, and creators dating all the way back to the beginning.
458520	461760	And at the end of your journey, you would hope to find it.
461760	464060	The original YouTube comment.
464080	467320	Tragically, the original comment no longer exists.
467320	470420	It was deleted due to repeated flaggings for spam
470420	473620	as a result of the Google Plus comment integration.
473620	477900	Yet another needless casualty to the failure of Google Plus.
477900	480160	However, Me at the Zoo's first comment
480160	482900	still lives on in a few screen captures from years ago.
482900	484440	Now I know what you're thinking.
484440	488580	The first comment on the first YouTube video.
488580	490780	People commenting first on YouTube videos
490840	494440	has become so widespread that it's a flippin' meme.
494440	495700	But what do you know?
495700	498800	The first ever comment posted on the first YouTube video
498800	501080	was interesting.
501080	503440	And that's pretty interesting.
503440	507560	YouTube Geographic is brought to you by Patreon
507560	509860	and by viewers like you.
509860	514360	But most importantly, viewers like LOLGamers606.
514360	515900	Thank you.
