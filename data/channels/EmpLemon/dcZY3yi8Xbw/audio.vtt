00:00.000 --> 00:03.780
YouTube is a vast ocean of content.

00:03.780 --> 00:08.820
Every 60 seconds, YouTubers produce over 400 hours of videos.

00:08.820 --> 00:12.320
That's about 17 days of videos per minute.

00:12.320 --> 00:16.660
You could spend the rest of your life watching nothing but new YouTube videos

00:16.660 --> 00:21.560
and you'll only watch 1 24,000th of all there is to see.

00:21.560 --> 00:24.720
Just imagine everything that you don't see.

00:24.720 --> 00:28.700
Imagine everything out there just waiting to be found.

00:28.740 --> 00:32.900
Behind every video is a person, a story, a legacy.

00:32.900 --> 00:35.640
So let's go out and explore it.

00:35.640 --> 00:39.740
Welcome everyone to YouTube Geographic.

00:58.700 --> 01:08.280
And since this is the beginning of a new series, we're going to start it off from the beginning of YouTube.

01:08.280 --> 01:13.720
That's right, today we're going to explore the first video uploaded to YouTube, me at the zoo.

01:13.720 --> 01:17.420
Alright, so here we are in front of the elephants.

01:17.420 --> 01:26.360
The cool thing about these guys is that they have really, really, really long trunks.

01:26.360 --> 01:28.360
And that's cool.

01:30.560 --> 01:33.060
And that's pretty much all there is to say.

01:33.060 --> 01:37.540
The first video on YouTube was not very impressive.

01:37.540 --> 01:42.380
It's a 240p, 18 second video of a guy talking about elephants.

01:42.380 --> 01:47.440
If this video existed in any other context, it would be completely forgettable.

01:47.440 --> 01:48.440
But it doesn't.

01:48.440 --> 01:52.420
And believe it or not, this is actually a very important video.

01:52.420 --> 01:55.220
Even more important than important videos.

01:55.220 --> 02:00.460
And in order to understand why it's so important, we must first understand its background.

02:00.460 --> 02:01.820
Let's start with the uploader.

02:01.820 --> 02:02.720
This guy.

02:02.720 --> 02:04.420
His name is Jawed Karim.

02:04.420 --> 02:07.160
He's one of the co-founders of YouTube.com.

02:07.160 --> 02:11.600
Karim has gone on the record and said that his original inspiration for creating YouTube

02:11.600 --> 02:15.460
was to find clips of Janet Jackson's Super Bowl wardrobe malfunction,

02:15.460 --> 02:18.100
which he couldn't find anywhere else on the web.

02:18.100 --> 02:24.540
Twelve years later, and YouTube is still a great resource for people trying to find clips of boobies.

02:24.560 --> 02:28.800
But more importantly, it speaks to one of YouTube's greatest utilities.

02:28.800 --> 02:33.380
YouTube has truly become one of the biggest video archives on the internet.

02:33.380 --> 02:37.740
Before YouTube, the only way to find an obscure video clip was to scour the web

02:37.740 --> 02:40.640
or track down an elusive VHS tape.

02:40.640 --> 02:43.580
It's hard to even imagine something like that nowadays,

02:43.580 --> 02:47.420
where everyone has a smartphone and can document any event of interest

02:47.420 --> 02:50.260
and post it to social media in a matter of seconds.

02:50.280 --> 02:55.320
It's almost impossible for any important event today to go undocumented.

02:55.320 --> 03:01.260
But back in 2004, 90 million people saw Janet Jackson's exposed nipple live

03:01.260 --> 03:04.200
and Jawed couldn't find any footage of it online.

03:04.200 --> 03:07.260
Now, thanks to YouTube, we can see it.

03:07.260 --> 03:12.740
Everyone can see it, along with a ton of other weird, obscure stuff that you never knew existed.

03:12.740 --> 03:15.400
And that's something I really like about YouTube,

03:15.420 --> 03:20.360
But it's not the reason why it's the most popular video streaming site in the world.

03:20.360 --> 03:23.620
Sure, the archive stuff is really nice for lurkers like me,

03:23.620 --> 03:27.560
but you don't get to a billion users by just being an archive.

03:27.560 --> 03:33.240
There's something about YouTube, an intrinsic quality about it that draws people in.

03:33.240 --> 03:37.740
Back in 2005, YouTube started off as just another Silicon Valley startup.

03:37.740 --> 03:42.380
It opened in a humble office above two restaurants in a California city.

03:42.400 --> 03:47.540
And just 18 months later, YouTube was the fifth most popular site on the internet,

03:47.540 --> 03:50.580
earning more than 100 million views per day.

03:50.580 --> 03:52.400
So what made YouTube so special?

03:52.400 --> 03:56.080
And what set it apart from all the other video streaming sites on the web?

03:56.080 --> 04:00.220
The answer, I believe, lies here in the very first video.

04:00.220 --> 04:03.820
Me at the zoo may just be a video of an average guy doing an average thing,

04:03.820 --> 04:06.820
but that's exactly why it's so important.

04:06.840 --> 04:10.480
By uploading this as the first video on YouTube,

04:10.480 --> 04:12.380
Josh set a precedent.

04:12.380 --> 04:17.720
He laid down the cornerstone that would define the spirit of YouTube for years to come.

04:17.720 --> 04:21.920
He established YouTube as a medium through which the common man

04:21.920 --> 04:25.120
could broadcast themselves to the entire world.

04:25.120 --> 04:28.260
YouTube was born as a site of the people.

04:28.260 --> 04:31.960
It completely reversed decades of steeped media tradition.

04:31.980 --> 04:37.080
Before YouTube, an ordinary person had no way of broadcasting their ideas,

04:37.080 --> 04:40.520
thoughts, and actions to more than a handful of people.

04:40.520 --> 04:43.820
YouTube granted the common man with great power,

04:43.820 --> 04:47.820
a power that had only previously been available to celebrities,

04:47.820 --> 04:50.000
movie stars, and rock stars.

04:50.000 --> 04:54.100
Now, thanks to YouTube, anyone can be like a rock star.

04:54.100 --> 04:56.960
And that's why people like YouTube so much.

04:56.960 --> 05:00.200
We enjoy seeing people like us succeed.

05:00.240 --> 05:04.580
We witness these average Joes get millions of hits and it gives us hope.

05:04.580 --> 05:07.980
It gives us hope that if they can make it big,

05:07.980 --> 05:12.220
then maybe, just maybe, we can too one day.

05:12.220 --> 05:15.900
And that, I believe, is the true spirit of YouTube.

05:15.900 --> 05:17.600
It's what drives us to try.

05:17.600 --> 05:19.600
It's what drives us to improve.

05:19.600 --> 05:22.500
It's what drives us to persist through thick and thin

05:22.500 --> 05:25.300
and all the stupid obstacles that are in our way.

05:25.300 --> 05:30.280
It's what drives us to compete head-on with channels a million times our size.

05:30.280 --> 05:34.520
And even though at times it may feel like you have a better chance of getting rich off the lottery

05:34.520 --> 05:36.580
than having one of your videos go viral,

05:36.580 --> 05:40.920
you just keep trying because you're saying there's a chance.

05:40.920 --> 05:45.560
And all of that is communicated through this 18-second video of a guy at the zoo.

05:45.560 --> 05:47.300
Of course, this is all implied.

05:47.300 --> 05:49.900
The guy is really only talking about elephants here.

05:49.900 --> 05:51.400
But he does have a point.

05:51.400 --> 05:53.500
Elephants do have pretty long trunks.

05:54.500 --> 05:58.280
By the end of 2006, Google had purchased YouTube

05:58.280 --> 06:02.280
and Jod earned $64 million worth of Google shares.

06:02.280 --> 06:03.780
Under Google's ownership,

06:03.780 --> 06:07.380
YouTube has gone through 11 years of countless updates and changes.

06:07.380 --> 06:12.060
Yet through all of that, this video and this channel have persisted,

06:12.060 --> 06:16.460
silently watching over the website that it kicked off all those years ago.

06:16.460 --> 06:19.200
YouTube has changed quite a bit since Google took over

06:19.200 --> 06:23.700
and it hasn't exactly been the most compatible with Jod's original vision.

06:23.700 --> 06:26.500
One of the most infamous changes that you may remember

06:26.500 --> 06:30.580
was the forced integration with Google+, a failed social network.

06:30.580 --> 06:32.020
At the time of its announcement,

06:32.020 --> 06:34.780
Jod actually made a rare post on his YouTube channel

06:34.780 --> 06:36.880
to interject his displeasure for the change.

06:36.880 --> 06:39.580
There's no doubt that forcing Google Plus on YouTubers

06:39.580 --> 06:42.880
was one of the most unpopular decisions in the history of the site.

06:42.880 --> 06:44.020
And for good reason.

06:44.020 --> 06:46.920
They threatened to take away people's ability to comment.

06:46.920 --> 06:48.920
Ah, yes, YouTube comments.

06:48.940 --> 06:51.020
I think everyone just pretends to hate them,

06:51.020 --> 06:53.280
when secretly, we all kind of like them.

06:53.280 --> 06:56.020
They're such an essential part of the YouTube experience.

06:56.020 --> 06:58.660
Me at the Zoo has about 300,000 comments.

06:58.660 --> 07:03.200
And there's not really any other comment section like it on YouTube.

07:03.200 --> 07:06.260
There aren't any flame wars or arguments going on.

07:06.260 --> 07:08.000
There are just a few memes.

07:08.000 --> 07:11.400
And memes have even managed to infiltrate the video's description.

07:11.400 --> 07:14.880
But that aside, most of the people commenting are just in awe.

07:14.880 --> 07:16.580
They're paying their respects

07:16.580 --> 07:20.240
and leaving their mark on YouTube's oldest video.

07:20.240 --> 07:22.880
And what we have created over 12 years of comments

07:22.880 --> 07:26.120
is a complete slice of YouTube history.

07:26.120 --> 07:29.220
If you go back through all those 300,000 comments,

07:29.220 --> 07:31.760
it'll be like traveling back in time.

07:31.760 --> 07:35.020
You will see a complete chronology of ideas,

07:35.020 --> 07:38.520
trends, and creators dating all the way back to the beginning.

07:38.520 --> 07:41.760
And at the end of your journey, you would hope to find it.

07:41.760 --> 07:44.060
The original YouTube comment.

07:44.080 --> 07:47.320
Tragically, the original comment no longer exists.

07:47.320 --> 07:50.420
It was deleted due to repeated flaggings for spam

07:50.420 --> 07:53.620
as a result of the Google Plus comment integration.

07:53.620 --> 07:57.900
Yet another needless casualty to the failure of Google Plus.

07:57.900 --> 08:00.160
However, Me at the Zoo's first comment

08:00.160 --> 08:02.900
still lives on in a few screen captures from years ago.

08:02.900 --> 08:04.440
Now I know what you're thinking.

08:04.440 --> 08:08.580
The first comment on the first YouTube video.

08:08.580 --> 08:10.780
People commenting first on YouTube videos

08:10.840 --> 08:14.440
has become so widespread that it's a flippin' meme.

08:14.440 --> 08:15.700
But what do you know?

08:15.700 --> 08:18.800
The first ever comment posted on the first YouTube video

08:18.800 --> 08:21.080
was interesting.

08:21.080 --> 08:23.440
And that's pretty interesting.

08:23.440 --> 08:27.560
YouTube Geographic is brought to you by Patreon

08:27.560 --> 08:29.860
and by viewers like you.

08:29.860 --> 08:34.360
But most importantly, viewers like LOLGamers606.

08:34.360 --> 08:35.900
Thank you.
