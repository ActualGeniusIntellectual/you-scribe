1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,780
YouTube is a vast ocean of content.

2
00:00:03,780 --> 00:00:08,820
Every 60 seconds, YouTubers produce over 400 hours of videos.

3
00:00:08,820 --> 00:00:12,320
That's about 17 days of videos per minute.

4
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:16,660
You could spend the rest of your life watching nothing but new YouTube videos

5
00:00:16,660 --> 00:00:21,560
and you'll only watch 1 24,000th of all there is to see.

6
00:00:21,560 --> 00:00:24,720
Just imagine everything that you don't see.

7
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:28,700
Imagine everything out there just waiting to be found.

8
00:00:28,740 --> 00:00:32,900
Behind every video is a person, a story, a legacy.

9
00:00:32,900 --> 00:00:35,640
So let's go out and explore it.

10
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:39,740
Welcome everyone to YouTube Geographic.

11
00:00:58,700 --> 00:01:08,280
And since this is the beginning of a new series, we're going to start it off from the beginning of YouTube.

12
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:13,720
That's right, today we're going to explore the first video uploaded to YouTube, me at the zoo.

13
00:01:13,720 --> 00:01:17,420
Alright, so here we are in front of the elephants.

14
00:01:17,420 --> 00:01:26,360
The cool thing about these guys is that they have really, really, really long trunks.

15
00:01:26,360 --> 00:01:28,360
And that's cool.

16
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:33,060
And that's pretty much all there is to say.

17
00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:37,540
The first video on YouTube was not very impressive.

18
00:01:37,540 --> 00:01:42,380
It's a 240p, 18 second video of a guy talking about elephants.

19
00:01:42,380 --> 00:01:47,440
If this video existed in any other context, it would be completely forgettable.

20
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:48,440
But it doesn't.

21
00:01:48,440 --> 00:01:52,420
And believe it or not, this is actually a very important video.

22
00:01:52,420 --> 00:01:55,220
Even more important than important videos.

23
00:01:55,220 --> 00:02:00,460
And in order to understand why it's so important, we must first understand its background.

24
00:02:00,460 --> 00:02:01,820
Let's start with the uploader.

25
00:02:01,820 --> 00:02:02,720
This guy.

26
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:04,420
His name is Jawed Karim.

27
00:02:04,420 --> 00:02:07,160
He's one of the co-founders of YouTube.com.

28
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:11,600
Karim has gone on the record and said that his original inspiration for creating YouTube

29
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:15,460
was to find clips of Janet Jackson's Super Bowl wardrobe malfunction,

30
00:02:15,460 --> 00:02:18,100
which he couldn't find anywhere else on the web.

31
00:02:18,100 --> 00:02:24,540
Twelve years later, and YouTube is still a great resource for people trying to find clips of boobies.

32
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:28,800
But more importantly, it speaks to one of YouTube's greatest utilities.

33
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:33,380
YouTube has truly become one of the biggest video archives on the internet.

34
00:02:33,380 --> 00:02:37,740
Before YouTube, the only way to find an obscure video clip was to scour the web

35
00:02:37,740 --> 00:02:40,640
or track down an elusive VHS tape.

36
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:43,580
It's hard to even imagine something like that nowadays,

37
00:02:43,580 --> 00:02:47,420
where everyone has a smartphone and can document any event of interest

38
00:02:47,420 --> 00:02:50,260
and post it to social media in a matter of seconds.

39
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:55,320
It's almost impossible for any important event today to go undocumented.

40
00:02:55,320 --> 00:03:01,260
But back in 2004, 90 million people saw Janet Jackson's exposed nipple live

41
00:03:01,260 --> 00:03:04,200
and Jawed couldn't find any footage of it online.

42
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:07,260
Now, thanks to YouTube, we can see it.

43
00:03:07,260 --> 00:03:12,740
Everyone can see it, along with a ton of other weird, obscure stuff that you never knew existed.

44
00:03:12,740 --> 00:03:15,400
And that's something I really like about YouTube,

45
00:03:15,420 --> 00:03:20,360
But it's not the reason why it's the most popular video streaming site in the world.

46
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:23,620
Sure, the archive stuff is really nice for lurkers like me,

47
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:27,560
but you don't get to a billion users by just being an archive.

48
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:33,240
There's something about YouTube, an intrinsic quality about it that draws people in.

49
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:37,740
Back in 2005, YouTube started off as just another Silicon Valley startup.

50
00:03:37,740 --> 00:03:42,380
It opened in a humble office above two restaurants in a California city.

51
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:47,540
And just 18 months later, YouTube was the fifth most popular site on the internet,

52
00:03:47,540 --> 00:03:50,580
earning more than 100 million views per day.

53
00:03:50,580 --> 00:03:52,400
So what made YouTube so special?

54
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:56,080
And what set it apart from all the other video streaming sites on the web?

55
00:03:56,080 --> 00:04:00,220
The answer, I believe, lies here in the very first video.

56
00:04:00,220 --> 00:04:03,820
Me at the zoo may just be a video of an average guy doing an average thing,

57
00:04:03,820 --> 00:04:06,820
but that's exactly why it's so important.

58
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:10,480
By uploading this as the first video on YouTube,

59
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:12,380
Josh set a precedent.

60
00:04:12,380 --> 00:04:17,720
He laid down the cornerstone that would define the spirit of YouTube for years to come.

61
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:21,920
He established YouTube as a medium through which the common man

62
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:25,120
could broadcast themselves to the entire world.

63
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:28,260
YouTube was born as a site of the people.

64
00:04:28,260 --> 00:04:31,960
It completely reversed decades of steeped media tradition.

65
00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:37,080
Before YouTube, an ordinary person had no way of broadcasting their ideas,

66
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:40,520
thoughts, and actions to more than a handful of people.

67
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:43,820
YouTube granted the common man with great power,

68
00:04:43,820 --> 00:04:47,820
a power that had only previously been available to celebrities,

69
00:04:47,820 --> 00:04:50,000
movie stars, and rock stars.

70
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:54,100
Now, thanks to YouTube, anyone can be like a rock star.

71
00:04:54,100 --> 00:04:56,960
And that's why people like YouTube so much.

72
00:04:56,960 --> 00:05:00,200
We enjoy seeing people like us succeed.

73
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:04,580
We witness these average Joes get millions of hits and it gives us hope.

74
00:05:04,580 --> 00:05:07,980
It gives us hope that if they can make it big,

75
00:05:07,980 --> 00:05:12,220
then maybe, just maybe, we can too one day.

76
00:05:12,220 --> 00:05:15,900
And that, I believe, is the true spirit of YouTube.

77
00:05:15,900 --> 00:05:17,600
It's what drives us to try.

78
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:19,600
It's what drives us to improve.

79
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:22,500
It's what drives us to persist through thick and thin

80
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:25,300
and all the stupid obstacles that are in our way.

81
00:05:25,300 --> 00:05:30,280
It's what drives us to compete head-on with channels a million times our size.

82
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:34,520
And even though at times it may feel like you have a better chance of getting rich off the lottery

83
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:36,580
than having one of your videos go viral,

84
00:05:36,580 --> 00:05:40,920
you just keep trying because you're saying there's a chance.

85
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:45,560
And all of that is communicated through this 18-second video of a guy at the zoo.

86
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:47,300
Of course, this is all implied.

87
00:05:47,300 --> 00:05:49,900
The guy is really only talking about elephants here.

88
00:05:49,900 --> 00:05:51,400
But he does have a point.

89
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:53,500
Elephants do have pretty long trunks.

90
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:58,280
By the end of 2006, Google had purchased YouTube

91
00:05:58,280 --> 00:06:02,280
and Jod earned $64 million worth of Google shares.

92
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:03,780
Under Google's ownership,

93
00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:07,380
YouTube has gone through 11 years of countless updates and changes.

94
00:06:07,380 --> 00:06:12,060
Yet through all of that, this video and this channel have persisted,

95
00:06:12,060 --> 00:06:16,460
silently watching over the website that it kicked off all those years ago.

96
00:06:16,460 --> 00:06:19,200
YouTube has changed quite a bit since Google took over

97
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:23,700
and it hasn't exactly been the most compatible with Jod's original vision.

98
00:06:23,700 --> 00:06:26,500
One of the most infamous changes that you may remember

99
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:30,580
was the forced integration with Google+, a failed social network.

100
00:06:30,580 --> 00:06:32,020
At the time of its announcement,

101
00:06:32,020 --> 00:06:34,780
Jod actually made a rare post on his YouTube channel

102
00:06:34,780 --> 00:06:36,880
to interject his displeasure for the change.

103
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:39,580
There's no doubt that forcing Google Plus on YouTubers

104
00:06:39,580 --> 00:06:42,880
was one of the most unpopular decisions in the history of the site.

105
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:44,020
And for good reason.

106
00:06:44,020 --> 00:06:46,920
They threatened to take away people's ability to comment.

107
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:48,920
Ah, yes, YouTube comments.

108
00:06:48,940 --> 00:06:51,020
I think everyone just pretends to hate them,

109
00:06:51,020 --> 00:06:53,280
when secretly, we all kind of like them.

110
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:56,020
They're such an essential part of the YouTube experience.

111
00:06:56,020 --> 00:06:58,660
Me at the Zoo has about 300,000 comments.

112
00:06:58,660 --> 00:07:03,200
And there's not really any other comment section like it on YouTube.

113
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:06,260
There aren't any flame wars or arguments going on.

114
00:07:06,260 --> 00:07:08,000
There are just a few memes.

115
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:11,400
And memes have even managed to infiltrate the video's description.

116
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:14,880
But that aside, most of the people commenting are just in awe.

117
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:16,580
They're paying their respects

118
00:07:16,580 --> 00:07:20,240
and leaving their mark on YouTube's oldest video.

119
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:22,880
And what we have created over 12 years of comments

120
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:26,120
is a complete slice of YouTube history.

121
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:29,220
If you go back through all those 300,000 comments,

122
00:07:29,220 --> 00:07:31,760
it'll be like traveling back in time.

123
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:35,020
You will see a complete chronology of ideas,

124
00:07:35,020 --> 00:07:38,520
trends, and creators dating all the way back to the beginning.

125
00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:41,760
And at the end of your journey, you would hope to find it.

126
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:44,060
The original YouTube comment.

127
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:47,320
Tragically, the original comment no longer exists.

128
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:50,420
It was deleted due to repeated flaggings for spam

129
00:07:50,420 --> 00:07:53,620
as a result of the Google Plus comment integration.

130
00:07:53,620 --> 00:07:57,900
Yet another needless casualty to the failure of Google Plus.

131
00:07:57,900 --> 00:08:00,160
However, Me at the Zoo's first comment

132
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:02,900
still lives on in a few screen captures from years ago.

133
00:08:02,900 --> 00:08:04,440
Now I know what you're thinking.

134
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:08,580
The first comment on the first YouTube video.

135
00:08:08,580 --> 00:08:10,780
People commenting first on YouTube videos

136
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:14,440
has become so widespread that it's a flippin' meme.

137
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:15,700
But what do you know?

138
00:08:15,700 --> 00:08:18,800
The first ever comment posted on the first YouTube video

139
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:21,080
was interesting.

140
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:23,440
And that's pretty interesting.

141
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:27,560
YouTube Geographic is brought to you by Patreon

142
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:29,860

But most importantly, viewers like LOLGamers606.

144
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:35,900
Thank you.
