Hey what's up guys, EpicVlogger52 here with another cool vlog.

00:25.720 --> 00:30.560
Hi everyone, what's happening?

00:30.560 --> 00:44.760
As you can see it's currently 9.35 on a Saturday, today is April 28th, 2018.

00:44.760 --> 00:54.400
What's up everyone, it's big boy vlogger Joey YouTube 68 here with another epic vlog about

00:54.400 --> 00:56.160
my life.

00:56.160 --> 01:04.920
Currently we are watching the NBA playoffs and uh, I don't know, what am I doing?

01:04.920 --> 01:07.840
What is this content that you clicked on, presumably?

01:07.840 --> 01:13.880
Aha, you see, because that's the long game, that's what you gotta do when you're a YouTuber,

01:13.880 --> 01:17.280
because right now, right now it's the present.

01:17.280 --> 01:21.180
Right now it's the present and I'm just recording this with my camera.

01:21.180 --> 01:28.600
But presumably I'm going to edit this content and upload it, and by then it'll be the future.

01:28.600 --> 01:30.740
So hello future people.

01:30.740 --> 01:38.620
So yeah, watching some sports, a lot of people like to pass their time by watching uh, TV

01:38.620 --> 01:47.060
shows or anime, uh but that kind of stuff has never really appealed to me, I'm more

01:47.060 --> 01:51.220
of a sports kind of guy, heck yeah, sports.

01:51.220 --> 02:02.420
We got uh, we got Boston, Boston playing Milwaukee in the playoffs, the NBA first round, Eastern

02:02.420 --> 02:12.180
Conference playoffs, big time basketball going on here, game seven, win or go home.

02:13.180 --> 02:19.860
Man this is absolutely riveting stuff right here, welcome back to another EmperorLemon

02:19.860 --> 02:26.700
live vlog reaction video, where today we're reacting to the playoffs.

02:26.700 --> 02:33.260
By the time this series is over, the NBA playoffs will be over, and um, we'll know who the champion

02:33.260 --> 02:39.460
is, who's it going to be, is it going to be Golden State, is it going to be Houston?

02:39.740 --> 02:49.740
Well uh, currently I'm about to record audio for uh, Minute Memes, Minute Memes, Minute

02:49.740 --> 02:55.460
Minute Minute Memes, haven't done a Minute Memes in a while, um, but yeah here's the

02:55.460 --> 03:00.780
process, I typed everything up in a Google Doc, I'm a script boy, as one YouTube commenter

03:00.780 --> 03:14.100
put it, and uh, another news today, interesting stuff going on with my boy CeeLo, CeeLoGreen,

03:14.100 --> 03:21.220
that was a very stupid comment, but he follows me, I think that's new, he follows me, back,

03:22.100 --> 03:31.380
CeeLo, CeeLo, a good boy, he uh, he does a bunch of research into how YouTube works,

03:31.380 --> 03:37.620
really um, really instrumental in kind of understanding, helping YouTubers understand

03:37.620 --> 03:46.420
the modern workings of YouTube, because everyone knows YouTube's not going to tell us anything.

03:46.420 --> 03:54.900
Today there's actually a reported anomaly, it's an anomaly folks, people are losing subscribers,

03:54.900 --> 04:03.220
but um, yeah it's only uh, it's only big boy, baddie, curse word channels, and not uh, not

04:03.220 --> 04:11.260
kitty kid fun toy channels, also Jake and Logan Paul, you see being a YouTuber is a

04:11.260 --> 04:19.700
lot like dealing with stuff like this, um, YouTube is a huge, huge site, and there's

04:19.700 --> 04:28.060
always a ton of stuff going on that no one has any idea, well that's pretty much all

04:28.060 --> 04:33.700
that happened to me, mine is 41, but yeah be sure to subscribe and help me make my subscriber

04:33.700 --> 04:38.340
videos, and like this video guys, good bye!

04:38.340 --> 04:47.340
Hi everyone, me again, uh, well yeah of course it's me again, who else could it be, I'm the

04:47.340 --> 04:55.780
only one editing this, nevermind, um, just uh, just having a live look in at the fun

04:55.780 --> 05:03.820
recording process, so I got everything uh, I got everything all dialed up, Audacity,

05:03.820 --> 05:11.220
the script, it's currently 10-12pm, and this video will be um, this video will be edited

05:11.220 --> 05:22.460
down to about 2 minutes, 2 minutes 20 seconds, let's say that, um, hey what's up guys, it's

05:22.460 --> 05:33.820
me again, and uh, what I'm doing here is making a timer for minute memes, that's right,

05:33.820 --> 05:44.020
I'm here in the uh, I'm here in the text, the text function of Vegas, and um, I'm going

05:44.020 --> 05:53.060
through one by one, adding the numbers, cause that's how dedicated I am, to making good

05:53.060 --> 06:03.940
content, I will go, I will jump through the hoops, if it means making a final product,

06:03.940 --> 06:10.980
that looks good, this new, this new minute memes, it's kinda got a football type, football

06:10.980 --> 06:19.500
John Madden, big time football aesthetic, so, the thing with that um, the thing with

06:19.500 --> 06:28.740
that style, I'm making the timer have a scoreboard look, and I looked online for just a scoreboard

06:28.740 --> 06:49.460
timer, and all of them kind of suck, so I'd rather make my own, man nobody watches NASCAR,

06:49.460 --> 06:56.300
you know like, in all the years I went to school, all the kids I ever met, I probably

06:56.300 --> 07:05.740
met like two others who watched NASCAR, um, I definitely think it's one of those things

07:05.740 --> 07:12.560
that was a lot more popular in the 90's, cause only 90's kids will remember when NASCAR was

07:12.560 --> 07:24.380
popular, just online, it's basically non-existent, it has no online presence, because uh, young

07:24.380 --> 07:35.780
people don't watch NASCAR, except for me, I will admit that, a lot of NASCAR races,

07:35.780 --> 07:44.420
it's not something you're really glued to the TV set for a while, um, races like Talladega

07:44.420 --> 07:50.620
are very exciting though, just because of the way they tune the cars for this specific

07:50.620 --> 07:58.480
track, it encourages pack racing, and at any moment a huge crash can come and take out

07:58.480 --> 08:08.620
like half the field, um, oh, big crash, see, that's what I was talking about, this style

08:08.620 --> 08:15.780
of racing is really unpredictable, who's gonna win, there's ten laps left, can you tell who's

08:15.780 --> 08:24.700
gonna win, leave a comment below if you think you know who's going to win, I'm just kidding,

08:24.700 --> 08:34.060
that finish sucked, fuck NASCAR, hey what's up guys, it's me again, it is currently Monday

08:34.060 --> 08:42.100
afternoon, let's see what's going on in the world right now and let's react to it, so

08:42.100 --> 08:53.700
uh, the top story right now, oh Marvel, them superheroes, very, very interesting, I definitely

08:53.700 --> 09:05.540
care a lot about superhero movies, um, superheroes are cool and they stop the world from getting

09:05.540 --> 09:12.240
destroyed and there definitely aren't enough superhero movies, so we need more through

09:12.240 --> 09:23.280
2025, let's see what else, the Avengers and the spoilers, the infinite Avengers infinity

09:23.280 --> 09:39.280
superhero movies, the world's gonna get destroyed, Trump, celebrity died, Sonic, superhero Avengers

09:39.280 --> 09:55.160
superhero, that's pretty cool I guess, someone fucked up, oh no, rapper died, well somebody died,

09:55.160 --> 10:04.280
I'm sorry, am I too callous, this one's in a big block so you know it's important, I should

10:04.280 --> 10:11.320
probably read some of the stuff on the on the right side of the page, oh epic prank, you can

10:11.320 --> 10:24.040
make Siri curse, that's so epic, that's so LMAO, some people made a Lego tree, a tree made of Legos,

10:24.040 --> 10:32.840
you know what, good for them, now here's the thing that's been going on recently, kind of just

10:33.080 --> 10:43.040
another excuse for people to get outraged for no reason, celebrity cool, celebrities are cool,

10:43.040 --> 10:51.520
oh wow Logan Paul and he's in a big box so you know it's important, Logan Paul is quitting, oh no,

10:51.520 --> 11:00.100
what will YouTube do without him, millennials, marketing millennials, millennial, millennial

11:00.100 --> 11:06.540
Trump, millennials, hey millennials, we need a market to you, buy our products because you're

11:06.540 --> 11:10.980
Millennials, I mean millennials, the thing about Millennials is they love getting called

11:10.980 --> 11:19.060
Millennials and Millennials, we need a market to them, howdy fellow Millennials, are you guys

11:19.060 --> 11:29.620
having fun being Millennials, oh epic, epic, roast, the woods, the Trump, the White House

11:29.620 --> 11:37.540
correspondent, oh she was so epic and she roasted the evil Republicans, it's so funny, oh even more

11:37.540 --> 11:46.460
coverage on the epic roast, they roasted, oh that's actually something positive about Trump,

11:46.460 --> 11:53.860
okay we don't need to, we don't need to hear about any of that, we are now rendering the video,

11:53.860 --> 12:05.060
my child, my son is being born, listen to the power, I don't know if the microphones picking

12:05.060 --> 12:14.940
it up but if it is then listen to the power of the rendering, this is pure bits, zeros and ones

12:14.940 --> 12:21.940
getting put into their place, rendering has completed, now that the video is rendered we

12:21.940 --> 12:27.780
can begin the most difficult process of being a YouTuber and that's making a YouTube thumbnail,

12:27.780 --> 12:37.100
so I already have a little tab here cued up with my boy John Madden, I don't know, I struggle,

12:37.100 --> 12:42.820
I spend more time on my thumbnails than on the videos themselves you know because they're that

12:42.860 --> 12:49.700
important, like I got to follow in the footsteps of the big YouTubers because how am I gonna make

12:49.700 --> 12:55.820
my channel grow up being strong if I don't have thumbnails like these guys, okay so you got to

12:55.820 --> 13:03.740
have a bunch of a bunch of goobers going, oh look at this, I'm reacting to this, oh what's this,

13:03.740 --> 13:15.380
oh look at me, I'm reacting to this thing, oh what's this, a Pokeball, a Pokeball, I'm so

13:15.380 --> 13:25.740
surprised, hmm, why does this have a watermark, now these are some high quality reaction images

13:25.740 --> 13:33.780
picked fresh from the fresh garden of fortune, this looks like a good one, just riveting content

13:33.780 --> 13:44.140
you're watching right here, all right so we got our boy in here, now it's time to add some epic

13:44.140 --> 13:54.220
text, at last my masterpiece is complete, all right well now that the thumbnail is complete

13:54.220 --> 14:13.020
it's time to upload the video, so exciting, now that the video is public, time to check some

14:13.020 --> 14:26.220
YouTube comments, Ripper Jack says yay, he's happy that I uploaded the video, yay to you Ripper,

14:26.220 --> 14:41.620
my people, my people, look at my people, man isn't being a YouTuber great, oh look everyone it's a

14:41.660 --> 14:53.220
new meme, get it while it's hot, new meme everyone, gosh I wonder if this will still be around in like

14:53.220 --> 14:59.820
three months when I upload this video, I think it'll be gone in a couple of days, what's up

14:59.820 --> 15:11.820
everybody it's May 1st 2018, Tuesday May 1st, so yesterday I uploaded my video, my big boy,

15:11.820 --> 15:23.100
big time meme, epic, epic meme video, it's about 18 hours later and we're at 46,000 views,

15:23.100 --> 15:32.500
whoopity-doo, it's actually a probably, probably better than most of my videos do after that

15:32.500 --> 15:40.340
amount of time, a couple of other interesting happenings going on, internet historian, my boy,

15:40.340 --> 15:47.980
sent me the in the field we worked on, so it's currently not live yet, I'm getting an extra

15:47.980 --> 16:01.300
special preview of myself, another one of my boys, Mum Key Jones, he came out with his actual Diary

16:01.300 --> 16:09.860
of a Wimpy Kid, Elliot Rogers parody and I actually think I'm gonna purchase this, support

16:10.100 --> 16:18.940
my fellow creators on YouTube, I mean no one else, there's not really anyone else on YouTube who

16:18.940 --> 16:29.980
makes content like Mum Key, all right Mum Key, I'm spending $20, 20 buckaronis, like that's like

16:29.980 --> 16:36.620
three days of YouTube income for me, I'm spending all of that on your book, so it better be good,

16:36.620 --> 16:47.180
and if it's not, I'll probably just complain, hi everyone, Killer Keemstar here, the king of

16:47.180 --> 16:54.420
YouTube drama and are we witnessing the end of Logan Paul's entire career, look at that ratio,

16:54.420 --> 17:06.420
look at that ratio, it's the last, the last of the sailors on the Logan Paul ship, they're trying

17:06.420 --> 17:15.940
trying to salvage everything, but it's it's a losing battle, I mean just look at look at these

17:15.940 --> 17:26.100
numbers, you just got twittered, your opinion means nothing because of the ratio man, this is the end,

17:26.100 --> 17:35.140
this is the point of no return, Logan Paul has gone so far down the spiral that he can never

17:35.380 --> 17:49.780
emerge, this meme is everywhere, all right, gonna do it, we're gonna do it, God, all right this is

17:49.780 --> 17:54.300
it right here, this is for all the marbles, here we go, oh,

18:05.140 --> 18:16.500
Infinity War meme is dead, now everyone, everyone, everyone post this meme, you know what,

18:16.500 --> 18:25.980
this meme is pretty good, I think I might make a video on it, goop videos was the first one to

18:25.980 --> 18:35.980
make this meme, rev up those fryers cuz I am sure hungry to make a new meme, all right guys let's

18:35.980 --> 18:48.740
make an Emperor lemon video right here, quick I gotta render my meme before anyone else steals my

18:48.740 --> 18:58.220
idea, oh wait a minute someone did my idea already, guess I have to delete my account now,

18:58.220 --> 19:07.620
all right now that the fucking lame obvious child's play version of the joke is online,

19:07.620 --> 19:13.140
we can get down to business and make a real version of this meme,

19:19.660 --> 19:26.420
ah now that's more like it, hey shut up idiot everyone knows Vsauce makes the best memes,

19:26.420 --> 19:33.900
whoa all this new meme excitement and there's a new death grips, slow down I'm gonna spurt,

19:40.700 --> 19:47.260
well guys it's been like an hour and a half but I'm finally done, I masked the thing,

19:47.260 --> 19:57.140
this is a productive use of my time, man isn't it beautiful, a lot of time went into that,

19:57.140 --> 20:05.380
that's how much I care about making good content right there, all right so let's see what we can

20:05.380 --> 20:34.580
do with this, ah now that is some quality content, hi everyone it's me,

20:34.780 --> 20:42.700
just checking in here and a little news stories trending on Twitter, so we're gonna check that

20:42.700 --> 20:49.380
out right now, oh so it turns out University of Florida the school I go to is a racist,

20:49.380 --> 20:57.900
the KKK are running University of Florida, they're nailing crosses in front of all the dormitories

20:57.900 --> 21:06.060
and they're burning them, there's just massive lynching activity going on at UF, so I should

21:06.060 --> 21:18.140
probably explain the context of this incident because context in fact does matter, so here's

21:18.140 --> 21:27.100
what happened as far as I know, so it's May, it's a end of the semester, graduation season

21:27.100 --> 21:33.940
for seniors in college, a couple of the graduates they wanted to do a little dance planned and

21:33.940 --> 21:41.020
choreographed, a little bit of a dance, I guess the I guess it went against the university etiquette

21:41.020 --> 21:47.740
or whatever and they were having none of that, so they yanked them off the stage, I know I think

21:47.740 --> 21:54.860
they should have been allowed to dance, I think that course of disciplinary action was a little

21:54.860 --> 22:01.020
bit rigid, a little antiquated, it's a big moment for them, let them dance, like their whole life

22:01.020 --> 22:09.140
has been leading up to this big graduation and like I don't really mind that, but that's pretty

22:09.140 --> 22:16.820
much where the story should end, yet somehow because the authority figure on stage was a white

22:16.900 --> 22:28.500
man and the quote unquote victims were black young adults, the media has interpreted and spun and

22:28.500 --> 22:38.100
labeled this story as a racially charged offense, you can argue about the discipline all you want

22:38.100 --> 22:45.660
okay, you can argue about the discipline, is it a disciplinary issue, yes sure, debate all you want

22:45.700 --> 22:52.700
about the discipline and the force they used, but to sit there and call this a racial issue

22:52.700 --> 23:00.900
is beyond misleading. To demonstrate my point even further, let's just let's just look at these

23:00.900 --> 23:07.820
headlines, several black University of Florida graduates yanked offstage, university response

23:07.820 --> 23:14.420
to charges of racism from Good Morning America, Good Morning America, here's another reason why

23:14.420 --> 23:22.460
you guys are racist, black University of Florida students, after several black graduates, what I'm

23:22.460 --> 23:28.340
saying is that you shouldn't present these issues racially when they're clearly not racially

23:28.340 --> 23:34.780
motivated okay, like why can't it just be students, well because then you can't spin it as a racial

23:34.780 --> 23:40.620
issue and no one will click on your story, so that's why they do it, to get clicks, but it's

23:40.620 --> 23:48.460
just damaging for society. ABC News, now this is big boy journalism old school but this is another

23:48.460 --> 23:55.660
thing to do, it was definitely contingent on a race one student tells, yeah so the opinion of

23:55.660 --> 24:03.380
one student is is just valuable enough to put in in the headline of the tweet, he said this, he said

24:03.380 --> 24:10.660
she said, one one person out of a thousand said this, let's put it in our headline, because once

24:10.660 --> 24:17.140
again you got to spin it, this is American journalism 2018, University of Florida forced

24:17.140 --> 24:23.460
to apologize after black and minority graduates were shoved off the stage by whites, why does this

24:23.460 --> 24:28.900
have to be a racial issue, well it's obvious why so that people will get mad and click on their

24:28.900 --> 24:34.980
article, but I guarantee you in two more weeks I'll be back with another story where the media

24:34.980 --> 24:44.260
does this, I guarantee it. All right so allow me to elaborate for a bit on why journalism like this

24:44.260 --> 24:51.540
is just so bad and so damaging for society, so what it basically what it basically does it creates

24:51.540 --> 24:58.660
a vicious cycle, so the cycle goes a little something like this, there's an event that

24:58.660 --> 25:06.340
happens and it happens to contain a white authority figure and a black victim okay,

25:07.220 --> 25:12.900
doesn't matter what the event is, the context doesn't matter at all, media picks up on it,

25:12.900 --> 25:18.820
they frame it as a racial issue, people see it, they're outraged, they have they develop this

25:18.820 --> 25:26.260
perception of society that everything is racist and then when an event like that happens again

25:26.980 --> 25:31.780
they interpret it as racist and it gets picked up by the news again and the cycle continues.

25:31.780 --> 25:38.420
There are many ways to look at something and interpret it, you could look at the sun

25:38.980 --> 25:45.460
with no context of how the universe works and believe that the sun revolves around the earth,

25:46.180 --> 25:53.860
but that doesn't exactly make it true, context matters okay. Let me give you another example,

25:53.860 --> 26:00.500
a news company can report on vaccinating children and they can title the article

26:01.460 --> 26:08.100
geriatric rich white men want to stick sharp needles inside of your children,

26:08.100 --> 26:15.140
yeah it's actually true but just the fact that you have completely ignored the context of the

26:15.220 --> 26:22.900
situation means that you are creating a false perception for the public, that's problematic,

26:23.620 --> 26:28.980
we shouldn't have a society where people are led to believe that everything around them is

26:28.980 --> 26:34.100
inherently racist, it's very unstable, would you rather have that or a society where people get

26:34.100 --> 26:38.980
along? I definitely want the second one, I don't know about some of these people, I don't know,

26:39.700 --> 26:46.340
it's like they want society to be more divided which is obviously it's in complete contradiction

26:46.340 --> 26:52.260
to their whole message of anti-racism but I feel like that's what a lot of these people want,

26:52.260 --> 26:59.700
they want to keep Americans divided and fighting among each other so that they can ignore actual

26:59.700 --> 27:04.580
issues that if they were to be reported on would harm the rich and powerful, it's like why would

27:04.580 --> 27:12.820
you want to cherry pick and nitpick and comb through society and identify every single instance

27:12.820 --> 27:17.540
possible, it's like not even confirmed, the vast vast vast majority of these cases that report in

27:17.540 --> 27:23.540
the media they're non-race issues and they get labeled as race issues, why would you want to go

27:23.540 --> 27:30.340
through and cherry pick every single little example you can from America, a country of 320

27:30.340 --> 27:36.660
million people, millions of interactions going on every second around the country and you find one,

27:36.660 --> 27:43.700
you find one thing that you contort into a racial issue and you blow it up and say whoa whoa look

27:43.700 --> 27:50.340
this is evidence, look we're right, look how racist America is and I just don't see it and for

27:50.900 --> 27:55.620
most people, most readers, most readers of those news articles that's the end of it, they don't,

27:56.580 --> 28:03.860
it's solidified in stone for them, a University of Florida racist, of course this news story

28:03.860 --> 28:10.900
it's just going to be forgotten about but I don't know, I chose this specific example to talk about

28:11.700 --> 28:21.540
because like I go to UF, it's not run by racist people okay and the fact that the media has taken

28:21.540 --> 28:30.020
this tiny little incident and blown it up to a story of national prominence, it really shows how

28:30.020 --> 28:36.740
they just care more about justifying their agenda than they do about presenting reality, I guess

28:36.740 --> 28:42.820
what I'm trying to say is that these stories do a lot more harm than good, they turn people against

28:42.820 --> 28:50.500
each other, make racial groups hate each other and I don't think that's good for society.

28:51.540 --> 29:14.020
Hi everybody, it's Wednesday morning and I'm fucking pissed, what you're seeing here is a

29:14.980 --> 29:24.660
fully monetized YouTube video which is a plane crash compilation, an actual compilation

29:25.700 --> 29:36.900
of plane crashes in real life, it's running seven ads, seven ad placements on a plane crash

29:37.700 --> 29:46.500
compilation, this is, this might be one of the worst things I've ever seen on YouTube,

29:46.500 --> 29:53.540
you obviously have the main principle of profiting off of hundreds of people's deaths

29:54.340 --> 30:04.180
but not only that, you have the fucking audacity to put on your stupid fucking After Effects

30:05.060 --> 30:12.740
epic YouTuber intro on content that you literally just re-uploaded from the website so it's not even

30:12.740 --> 30:18.340
original content and you put on your fucking After Effects intro, you load up the video with

30:18.340 --> 30:25.140
seven ads and you make money off of nine million views and YouTube has done fucking nothing about

30:25.140 --> 30:36.020
this, god damn it man, just god damn it, why is this website so fucking fucked up and I've tried,

30:36.020 --> 30:40.740
I've tried for the past four months or so not to not complain about YouTube,

30:41.860 --> 30:48.580
they've tried communicating better, they tried fixing the monetization system but then I just

30:48.580 --> 30:56.740
see shit like this and it's like we haven't left square fucking one, what the fuck YouTube,

30:57.700 --> 31:05.220
plane crash compilation fully monetized, how the fuck does a plane crash compilation slip under

31:05.220 --> 31:14.580
the radar, I don't understand what you people are doing, fully monetized, seven ad placements

31:14.580 --> 31:22.180
on a plane crash compilation, not a fictional plane crash compilation, real actual footage

31:23.220 --> 31:30.660
not unlike the footage you'd find on live leak, the difference being that this person

31:30.660 --> 31:40.580
is earning thousands of dollars of revenue from hundreds of people dying, dying, Logan Paul filmed

31:40.580 --> 31:47.620
one dead guy and the collective internet flipped their shit but meanwhile you have people uploading

31:47.620 --> 31:55.060
footage of hundreds of people dying, dying, not already dead like Logan did, dying,

31:55.940 --> 32:06.340
your fucking system somehow sees that as perfectly okay, how, how come every respectable commentary

32:06.340 --> 32:12.340
channel on YouTube has basically been shadow banned and demonetized and kicked down the pecking

32:12.340 --> 32:18.980
order and scrutinized as hard as they possibly fucking can by your fucking automated system

32:18.980 --> 32:25.460
for the past 18 months, meanwhile plane crash compilation, oh that's perfectly fine, loaded up

32:25.460 --> 32:32.100
with ads, I usually don't get this angry about anything, politics I don't really care that much,

32:33.060 --> 32:42.660
whatever but when I see a system that is just so fundamentally unfair as YouTube's monetization

32:42.660 --> 32:48.740
system is, I lose my fucking shit, they tell us all the rules, they tell us all the rules over

32:48.740 --> 32:54.500
and over again and hammer it into our heads, don't do this, don't do that, and even if you follow

32:54.500 --> 33:00.820
those rules there's a 50-50 chance that your video is just going to get demonetized anyway because

33:00.900 --> 33:06.420
they blacklisted your channel or something like they've done with mine where they don't send out

33:06.420 --> 33:11.300
your videos to recommendations or notifications or subscriptions, they've done it to me,

33:11.860 --> 33:18.660
they've drug my channel and a bunch of other people's through the fucking mud because we

33:18.660 --> 33:26.020
dare speak up about this bullshit, they turn their back away from plane crash compilations,

33:26.660 --> 33:33.460
it's like you can't make this shit up, we are in the dystopian present on YouTube, this is their

33:33.460 --> 33:40.660
end game, this is what all the fucking shit, all the changes, all the make your videos longer,

33:40.660 --> 33:45.860
more and more and more content, oh but don't make original content, we'll shit on you for that,

33:45.860 --> 33:52.100
oh but if you're re-uploading someone else's content and it just happens to be plane crashes

33:52.100 --> 33:57.780
and you put it all back to back and you have a fucking after effects intro with obnoxious EDM

33:57.780 --> 34:06.180
music, that's perfectly fine, this is their end game I guess, they made YouTube inhospitable for

34:07.220 --> 34:13.940
original content, they made YouTube inhospitable for talent, they don't emphasize any of that on

34:13.940 --> 34:20.740
YouTube anymore, it's all about oh how long can you make, oh how much watch time, who gives a fuck

34:20.740 --> 34:27.060
about watch time okay, and I'll tell you why they do it is because the more time you spend on

34:27.060 --> 34:33.860
YouTube the less time you spend on a competitor site like Facebook, but even so what has this

34:33.860 --> 34:41.540
done to the content on YouTube, I know I made a whole 49 minute video about this talking about

34:41.540 --> 34:47.060
the consequences of all this shit, but we're there, this is as bad as I've ever seen YouTube

34:47.060 --> 34:56.100
content okay, monetizing plane crash tragedies, plane crash compilations, like I still can't

34:56.100 --> 35:01.940
fucking believe it, but it's the video is right there still running ads on it, how the fuck is it

35:02.740 --> 35:10.820
morally consistent to just scrub YouTube from gun content, but oh plane crash compilations,

35:10.820 --> 35:17.460
that's perfectly fine, god I just don't understand this website, it's like they never

35:17.460 --> 35:25.060
learn, they never learn, Elsa gate, child endangerment, oh we're gonna get rid of that

35:25.060 --> 35:32.180
content once it starts, once the ads start pulling out, Logan Paul suicide victim, the worst PR

35:32.180 --> 35:40.340
disaster for YouTube ever, certainly ever, and they still won't police this shit, and I said this on

35:40.340 --> 35:48.740
Twitter, how the fuck, how the fuck does a video titled airplane crash compilation not immediately

35:48.740 --> 35:56.740
set up a million alarms in the demonetization system, how is that not set off a million red flags

35:57.380 --> 36:02.820
just instantly demonetize this video, but now it's been up there, the video is like a year old,

36:02.820 --> 36:09.140
it's like eight months old, running seven ads, nine million views, probably made

36:10.020 --> 36:16.180
a couple thousand bucks off of that content, I've moved past the idea of complaining about the idea

36:16.180 --> 36:23.700
of demonetization, okay, if YouTube wants to implement a system where they only put ads on

36:24.580 --> 36:28.820
family-friendly content, then whatever, but if you put in a system like that,

36:28.820 --> 36:36.340
you have to, have to, have to, absolutely have to enforce it fairly, I just hate being treated

36:36.340 --> 36:43.940
unfairly, it's not just me, it's every YouTuber, gaming channels, commentary channels,

36:43.940 --> 36:48.180
pretty much every YouTuber that tries to put an effort into their content these days gets

36:48.180 --> 36:54.580
fucking sandbagged, and I'd be okay with that, I'd be okay with that, they just did it with everyone,

36:54.580 --> 37:01.620
maybe it's people, maybe it's not YouTube, maybe it's just people that are just so morally

37:01.620 --> 37:11.300
inconsistent about everything, I mean Logan Paul uploaded a video of one dead guy, one guy who

37:11.300 --> 37:17.060
already died and the internet lost their collective shit over it, and I'm not saying people don't care

37:17.060 --> 37:22.580
about this, but I know that video had nine million views by the time I watched it and never heard a

37:22.580 --> 37:29.620
peep about it, and it has hundreds of people dying, not already deceased, dying, and Logan

37:29.620 --> 37:36.100
Paul's video wasn't monetized, I mean YouTube did put that shit on trending, but like Logan Paul

37:36.100 --> 37:44.580
didn't monetize the video, this guy, plane crash compilation dude, seven ad placements on a video

37:44.580 --> 37:52.580
showcasing the deaths of hundreds of people, I know it's just astonishing, and my little tweet

37:52.580 --> 37:58.900
about it will probably get a couple thousand likes and a few hundred retweets and that'll be the end

37:58.900 --> 38:07.300
of it and everyone will forget about it, I mean no more, no massive outrage over the plane crash

38:07.300 --> 38:15.380
compilation, it's literally the same principle but a hundred times worse, but will people care,

38:15.380 --> 38:21.940
will YouTube make a sappy apology for this, will anything even happen to that video, will I check

38:21.940 --> 38:27.860
back in six weeks and that video will still be breaking in that revenue, I don't know,

38:29.060 --> 38:35.700
I don't know, surprise me YouTube, surprise me okay, I just want to say one more thing before

38:35.700 --> 38:42.340
I end this rant, YouTube and a lot of people probably wonder why YouTube is so hated,

38:43.060 --> 38:50.020
because I don't know if you've checked the internet in the past eight months, but YouTube is hated,

38:50.660 --> 38:58.260
they're hated more than any other social network, they're hated, they're hated to the extent

38:58.260 --> 39:04.820
that someone actually got pissed off enough at them to break into their headquarters and shoot

39:04.820 --> 39:13.220
up the place, I'm not saying it's justified, no it sucks and it's a fucking deranged lunatic,

39:14.100 --> 39:19.940
but I don't know, it's just a testament, it's a testament to this hole that YouTube has dug

39:19.940 --> 39:28.980
themselves in where people hate them, people go fucking postal because of how bad YouTube has been

39:28.980 --> 39:36.100
over the past couple of years and they wonder why, they wonder why and it's not because YouTubers

39:36.100 --> 39:44.340
are entitled, it's not because millennials are lazy, no it's because of inconsistent unfair

39:44.340 --> 39:51.460
bullshit like this, where they police and scrutinize every chicken little thing from

39:51.460 --> 39:58.820
one tiny part of YouTube and they just let plane crash compilations soak in the revenue regardless,

39:59.460 --> 40:05.220
it's okay, it's this type of shit that drives people fucking mental and they need to fix it,

40:06.180 --> 40:12.740
how much longer, how much longer are we gonna have to endure a system like either, either let

40:12.740 --> 40:19.780
everyone run ads or take the ads off fucking plane crashes okay and it's not just the, and don't think

40:19.780 --> 40:25.060
I'm just making this video about one video, it's like, it's like if you find a roach in your house

40:25.060 --> 40:31.380
there's probably a hundred other roaches around, there's probably tens of thousands of videos like

40:31.380 --> 40:41.220
this, fucking shitty compilations that rake in revenue from stolen content and in these specific

40:41.220 --> 40:50.580
cases rake in revenue from literally showcasing the tragedies and death and slaughter of hundreds

40:50.580 --> 40:56.900
of people and I just wanna say YouTube wonders why they're the most hated website on the internet,

40:56.900 --> 41:02.020
it's because of shit like this and until they fix it, it's not gonna change,

41:03.620 --> 41:09.940
people are still gonna hate them, just want to let you guys know that after the whole Logan Paul

41:09.940 --> 41:17.060
thing, YouTube really has been trying to improve their communication, they're basically responding

41:17.060 --> 41:25.940
to every knucklehead that pings them, even 13 year olds with 2,000 subscribers and yet despite

41:26.500 --> 41:38.020
all of these responses and even though after I tweeted to them that their platform is running ads

41:38.900 --> 41:46.660
on a plane crash compilation, they didn't say shit about it and like dozens of people,

41:46.660 --> 41:55.220
dozens of people pinged YouTube at Team YouTube at YT Creators, like a dozen people pinged them

41:55.220 --> 42:04.180
and no response, radio silence, they might have me blocked or something, yeah it's very clear that

42:04.740 --> 42:12.260
they're not interested in hearing what I have to say, so whatever, oh man it looks like all

42:12.260 --> 42:18.660
my complaining finally paid off, this is just a reminder to everyone out there that if you

42:18.660 --> 42:26.180
complain hard enough and you shitpost long enough, good things will happen, what's up everybody,

42:28.020 --> 42:36.500
looks like Mumkey's book finally came in the mail, looks like we got an unboxing video to do,

42:37.140 --> 42:46.980
all right so as you can see there is a box and it's taped up pretty tightly so

42:47.780 --> 42:53.860
I think I'm gonna have to go get some scissors, all right everyone I got the scissors,

42:54.580 --> 43:04.500
snip snip, all right we're gonna work on cutting open the tape now, in case you didn't know I'm

43:04.500 --> 43:14.660
left-handed, that's what makes me special, all right so god fucking right-handed normies,

43:14.660 --> 43:20.660
they think they're so cool with their right hand, I don't know, me making 90% of people,

43:20.660 --> 43:29.060
fucking normies, try that shit open, all right so as you can see Mumkey sent me some bubble wrap

43:29.620 --> 43:42.980
to complement the book, shipping information, aha and the piece of resistance,

43:43.860 --> 43:52.420
look at it, look at the glory, look how glorious this product is that I ordered,

43:52.420 --> 44:01.140
oh it's so shiny, this thing is shiny as fuck, man I can't wait to delve into the literary

44:01.140 --> 44:07.860
adventure that Mumkey has provided for me on this fine day, what's up everybody, it's about a week

44:08.660 --> 44:14.980
later, didn't really feel like recording anything for the last seven days, yeah so the reason I

44:14.980 --> 44:24.020
haven't been making anything is because I have been writing, researching and recording this 20

44:24.020 --> 44:33.060
page script, this might end up being the longest video I've ever made and it might end up being

44:33.060 --> 44:39.220
the best video I've ever made, I should probably get you guys back up to speed on current events

44:39.220 --> 44:44.180
because there's no way you know them yourself so it's up to me to tell you and remind you,

44:44.740 --> 44:50.820
all right so this image basically sums up the new memes that have been circulating over the past

44:50.820 --> 44:59.780
week, oh and this morning there is another school shooting in America, what's up everybody it's me

44:59.780 --> 45:09.780
again here with another fantastic backyard commentary, first let me just say that I haven't

45:09.780 --> 45:20.260
been vlogging as much because I don't know everything's just been really boring, I've been

45:20.260 --> 45:29.140
hard at work editing the new youtube geographic, it's gonna be a big boy, big time, big ticket

45:29.140 --> 45:35.940
video, game changer, game changing video, I don't know it's probably gonna come out after the first

45:35.940 --> 45:47.060
part of this vlog so be prepared for that, all right so it is currently may 22nd 2018

45:48.340 --> 45:56.420
and the news recently there's been a lot of talk, a lot of talk about the old school shootings,

45:56.420 --> 46:03.380
school shootings, a lot of conversation about school shootings, every time you hear the issue

46:03.380 --> 46:13.220
of school shootings mentioned in the news all they talk about is gun gun gun gun gun gun rifle

46:13.220 --> 46:24.820
gun gun gun assault weapon gun nra gun gun rifle gun and usually the times when gun control as an

46:24.820 --> 46:33.300
issue is discussed most frequently is immediately following a school shooting, it's a very evocative

46:33.540 --> 46:40.980
issue which is why every time there is a school shooting in America it gets reported on like

46:40.980 --> 46:49.940
crazy and it becomes the single most salient issue for the next week at least and obviously it's a

46:49.940 --> 46:57.300
problem that everyone wants to stop and I'm pretty sure no one whether you're Republican or Democrat

46:57.300 --> 47:04.580
or an independent no one thinks there should be more school shootings but by that same token

47:04.580 --> 47:09.220
everyone wants to scramble for a solution as soon as the school shooting happens the

47:09.220 --> 47:18.740
discussion immediately gets pinned and imprisoned in the idea that guns are the primary issue

47:18.740 --> 47:23.780
and throughout all the news coverage throughout all the discussion all the arguments you see on

47:23.780 --> 47:31.700
twitter on youtube throughout all of it I don't know I've never seen anyone discuss what I think

47:31.700 --> 47:37.780
is the real issue in school shootings and that issue I believe is the schools the issue with

47:37.780 --> 47:45.300
school shootings is schools now before I talk about this I want you all to just completely

47:45.300 --> 47:52.500
forget about guns okay just completely wipe guns from your mind whenever there's a school shooting

47:52.500 --> 48:01.380
like this it always happens with a very troubled kid and instead of just blaming the idea of guns

48:01.380 --> 48:09.460
or people who enable guns it's far far far more important in my opinion to consider what

48:09.460 --> 48:16.500
circumstances caused this kid to bring a loaded gun to school and start shooting his classmates

48:16.500 --> 48:22.180
because I don't know if you people have noticed either if you're too old you're too young or

48:22.180 --> 48:30.820
you're not from America but schools in America suck okay I live in the state of Florida

48:32.100 --> 48:39.380
and the school district I went to is supposedly the best in the state of Florida and you want to

48:39.380 --> 48:47.300
know what it still sucks just completely unstimulating to the actual concept of education

48:47.860 --> 48:54.340
just miserable kids all over the place nobody wants to be there especially once you get closer

48:54.340 --> 49:00.340
to the age of 18 no one wants to be there if you look at all these kids all these school shooters

49:01.220 --> 49:08.180
they all have certain things in common first of all they're usually very anti-social or socially

49:08.180 --> 49:15.380
awkward and most of them have a history of being bullied by their classmates now schools in America

49:15.380 --> 49:23.780
they'll pretend they'll say all these things about wanting to stop bullying but in reality

49:23.780 --> 49:29.700
it's completely unenforceable and there's nothing they can really do about it and a lot of things

49:29.700 --> 49:36.500
that people don't understand because either they've been too far removed from school or

49:36.500 --> 49:42.660
they're in school and they've just accepted it as normality and they don't know any other way

49:42.660 --> 49:50.660
of life one thing that these people rarely notice is that kids are vicious okay pretty much between

49:50.660 --> 49:58.500
the age of 10 and 18 these kids are absolutely vicious obviously it's very easy to look at young

49:58.500 --> 50:06.420
kids and young teens and imagine that they are very innocent little harmless defenseless victims

50:06.420 --> 50:12.180
but I don't know this is just coming from me just observing how people act and I was in school

50:12.660 --> 50:19.300
two years ago and this is how people are the problem with kids and early teens is that they

50:19.300 --> 50:28.180
have no concept of morality they either have no concept or a very remedial concept of morality

50:28.180 --> 50:33.940
and this is just this is just an aspect of psychology where your brain is literally not

50:33.940 --> 50:41.300
finished developing in how to deal with ethics and morals and it's important to remember that

50:41.300 --> 50:47.140
because kids most of them and there's a lot of nice ones but there's a lot of ones that

50:47.140 --> 50:52.900
are completely vicious and this isn't just this isn't a new thing this is a part of every

50:52.900 --> 51:00.740
generation so kids in school they're highly conscientious they care so much about appearance

51:00.740 --> 51:09.060
and hierarchy and status there's so much peer pressure to conform to societal norms and the

51:09.060 --> 51:18.260
alternative is being ridiculed and cast aside as an outcast what I'm basically saying is that

51:18.260 --> 51:24.580
it's just very natural for kids to sort of relentlessly pick on other kids that don't fit in

51:25.780 --> 51:32.500
and I just think that there's this huge disconnect in our society with how we treat introverted

51:32.500 --> 51:41.300
people and it's very ironic because we live in an age where schools and bureaucrats and politicians

51:41.300 --> 51:50.100
will bend over backwards to accommodate any person that they to accommodate anyone who we view as a

51:50.100 --> 51:57.220
victim based on only physical traits however the great irony in all of this is that you have

51:57.220 --> 52:05.700
somehow ignored and continued to ignore the huge monumental difference between introverted kids

52:05.700 --> 52:11.940
and extroverted kids and this is coming again from someone who growing up in school was very

52:11.940 --> 52:18.660
introverted found it very hard to talk to people and it's not just it's not just something you can

52:18.660 --> 52:25.300
easily just pick up and uh we just throw you in with all these people you make friends it's not

52:25.300 --> 52:34.100
like that and I think a lot of the problems that come with schools and behavior in 21st century

52:34.100 --> 52:41.460
America is a fundamental misunderstanding of how introverted people think and act and it's a pretty

52:41.460 --> 52:49.220
alarming problem because if you really think about it logically pretty much everyone in power at not

52:49.220 --> 52:55.540
just schools but in the government are going to be extroverted people like it's just a matter of

52:56.180 --> 53:01.300
natural selection a clammy introverted guy who doesn't talk to anyone is going to be far less

53:01.300 --> 53:10.900
likely to succeed in a political campaign so based on that fact pretty much everyone in politics all

53:10.900 --> 53:18.740
of our lawmakers they have to be extroverted people and the same theory applies to teachers

53:18.820 --> 53:26.340
faculty people who in their job description they have to work and interact with people all day

53:26.340 --> 53:32.180
they're naturally going to be more extroverted people and what that's created in our society

53:32.180 --> 53:39.220
at least I feel it's a huge rift between the extroverted and the empowered people in our

53:39.220 --> 53:47.140
society growing up and introverted people who feel like they have no one to turn to

53:48.020 --> 53:51.860
because if you think about it from the perspective of an introverted person growing up in school

53:52.500 --> 53:57.860
like what are they going to do if they have a problem naturally the course of action in

53:57.860 --> 54:04.420
all these cases oh go talk to the teacher go talk to the guidance counselor but these teachers and

54:04.420 --> 54:10.580
guidance counselors they're extroverted people and they don't understand the mentality of being

54:10.900 --> 54:17.540
introverted it's a real shame because our school system treats introverted people

54:17.540 --> 54:24.100
so unbelievably poorly and they are completely oblivious to that fact I don't know if this

54:24.660 --> 54:31.300
concept resonates with any of you out there who may be introverted people have trouble

54:31.300 --> 54:38.260
talking to people in public or socially awkward and you remember growing up in school and they

54:38.260 --> 54:45.220
force you they force you to do all these activities group work group projects bonding

54:45.780 --> 54:52.020
activities and all of this is by the design of extroverted people who think everyone in

54:52.020 --> 54:58.100
the world is extroverted when that's simply not true and when you force introverted kids

54:58.100 --> 55:04.500
place themselves in social situations with which they're uncomfortable or to do these activities

55:04.500 --> 55:11.620
where you force them to interact with people they don't care for you create a recipe for a very

55:11.620 --> 55:19.780
miserable individual and it's a lot of these individuals who eventually grow up to become

55:19.780 --> 55:27.060
the prototypical school shooter and I'm not saying it's justified at all obviously these people have

55:27.060 --> 55:34.260
been pushed to a point where they have mentally gone off the deep end and their actions are no

55:34.260 --> 55:43.780
longer governed by reason or morality so I'm not trying to sympathize with school shooters at all

55:43.780 --> 55:48.740
but at the same time it's very important to understand where some of these kids are coming

55:48.740 --> 55:58.900
from these are socially awkward anti-social kids who are forced by our society to spend six hours

55:58.900 --> 56:07.300
a day five days a week 180 days a year in an environment where they are constantly uncomfortable

56:08.260 --> 56:14.500
and once again the vast majority of people in our society they don't understand this point of view

56:14.500 --> 56:20.980
because when you're extroverted and it's about 70 percent of people you don't feel this constant

56:20.980 --> 56:26.260
pressure and this constant anxiety when you're in public it just doesn't make sense and you can't

56:26.260 --> 56:32.900
wrap your head around it and you can't develop empathy for these people and when you're growing

56:32.900 --> 56:39.860
up in school the majority of people just turn that idea of them acting different into ostracizing them

56:39.860 --> 56:47.860
and excluding them and it just makes things a lot worse so I guess my point with all this is that

56:48.660 --> 56:55.620
we need to understand and treat introverted people a lot better and I think when we do we will see

56:56.260 --> 57:01.140
a vast reduction in school shootings if you think about these kids if you think about

57:01.140 --> 57:09.220
the Houston shooter if you think about Nicholas Cruz why are we as a society

57:10.260 --> 57:17.780
forcing these kids who clearly do not belong in a social situation and every time they're

57:17.780 --> 57:25.060
exposed to a situation it worsens their emotional state why are we forcing kids like this to go to

57:25.060 --> 57:32.420
school and be in an environment they hate I don't understand especially now that we have online

57:32.420 --> 57:41.220
school and there's so much of an opportunity for virtual school and I don't buy in to this

57:41.220 --> 57:47.220
expectation that if you don't make friends if you don't get along with people then you're not going

57:47.220 --> 57:52.180
to have a good time as an adult you know well first of all these introverted antisocial kids

57:52.180 --> 57:58.260
they're not having a good time as a child okay and it's not a matter of just making friends it's

57:58.260 --> 58:04.900
an actual mental block and I've experienced it I'm sure a lot of you have experienced it or it's not

58:04.900 --> 58:09.620
just the thing where you can flip on a switch and be like oh well I'm ready to make friends now it's

58:09.620 --> 58:15.140
not that simple and until our society understands this there's going to be a fundamental disconnect

58:15.140 --> 58:22.980
in how we treat introverted people and the idea the idea that you have to be socially well-rounded

58:23.540 --> 58:31.940
to succeed in adult society is complete BS yeah I'm sure you have to be really socially outgoing

58:31.940 --> 58:37.300
to sit at a computer in a cubicle for 11 hours a day there's no actual requirement that you have

58:37.300 --> 58:46.180
to be socially outgoing in order to have a stable career and life in society but for some reason

58:46.180 --> 58:53.460
the powers that be have made it an expectation for people where oh you have to have people skills if

58:53.460 --> 59:02.660
you want to succeed I don't buy into it at all maybe in the 1950s but not now when 90 percent of

59:02.660 --> 59:08.100
all work in the world goes through the internet where you don't actually have to directly

59:08.100 --> 59:14.580
communicate between people I don't buy for one second that you gotta be socially outgoing to

59:14.580 --> 59:20.420
succeed it just doesn't make sense and it's ridiculous especially now that we have the

59:20.420 --> 59:26.820
internet and online schooling to continue forcing these introverted people to be miserable and

59:26.820 --> 59:30.980
that's the real problem and that's the real discussion we need to be having as to why these

59:30.980 --> 59:36.980
school shootings are happening but uh no one's going to talk about that because gun gun gun

59:36.980 --> 59:47.220
assault rifle gun nra gun gun gun gun gun ah what a beautiful day I wonder what's going on with

59:47.220 --> 59:55.300
youtube oh well time to make another video complaining about youtube okay I just want to

59:55.300 --> 01:00:02.340
point out that it's really ironic and hilarious that I'm making a rant about youtube and in in

01:00:02.340 --> 01:00:10.020
like 10 minutes I'm having a consultation with a youtube partner manager you're literally watching

01:00:10.020 --> 01:00:16.900
the destruction of my youtube career they will never ever let me get any views after this

01:00:16.900 --> 01:00:27.540
hi everyone back at you again with the basketball so I got off the old youtube conference call with

01:00:27.540 --> 01:00:35.940
my very own partner manager I should probably explain the context leading up to this encounter

01:00:36.740 --> 01:00:44.340
I think about three weeks ago I got emailed by a person from youtube saying they want to contact me

01:00:44.340 --> 01:00:54.100
now I've been a youtube partner for almost four years now but this was my first real interaction

01:00:54.660 --> 01:01:03.140
with an actual human that works at youtube I know it's amazing I always used to view youtube as this

01:01:03.940 --> 01:01:11.860
monolithic faceless corporation and even though my opinion of youtube hasn't really changed

01:01:11.860 --> 01:01:20.260
after this interaction I do feel like I'm in a different place I'm working my way up the ranks

01:01:20.260 --> 01:01:28.980
guys so how did the call go um it was a little odd I can't say it went differently than I expected

01:01:29.700 --> 01:01:35.940
but still though the just the novelty of talking to an actual human who works at youtube

01:01:36.820 --> 01:01:42.020
it's something I've never really experienced before there was one point in the conversation

01:01:42.020 --> 01:01:52.900
when I hinted at my videos being blacklisted and not showing up in people's recommendations

01:01:53.460 --> 01:02:00.900
I'm 80 sure that this person I was talking to was aware of all the of all the videos I did

01:02:00.900 --> 01:02:06.740
complaining about youtube that was kind of the elephant in the room during the whole

01:02:06.740 --> 01:02:13.060
conversation and we never really discussed it because this person I talked to they were aware of

01:02:13.060 --> 01:02:20.260
minute memes they were aware of youtube geographic it was clear to me that they at the very least

01:02:20.260 --> 01:02:28.100
skimmed my content so I wouldn't be surprised if they didn't also know about the youtube complaint

01:02:28.100 --> 01:02:35.060
stuff so we talked for about 20 minutes you know there's a lot of introductory stuff just asking

01:02:35.060 --> 01:02:40.100
me about sort of the direction of my channel so we didn't get a didn't really get to talk about

01:02:40.100 --> 01:02:48.900
anything that in depth um however we did schedule a meeting for uh for june one day in june gonna

01:02:48.900 --> 01:02:54.740
have a meeting and we're gonna go a lot more in depth in into the discussion so we'll just have

01:02:54.740 --> 01:03:00.260
to see what happens there but after this encounter I did have a change of heart with the uh

01:03:00.820 --> 01:03:08.340
with the next youtube rant and after talking to this person at youtube I just don't think I can

01:03:08.340 --> 01:03:16.420
go through with uploading this rant as its own video and that's not because I got brainwashed

01:03:16.420 --> 01:03:23.220
by the cult of youtube no I still feel as strongly about that issue as I did before the meeting the

01:03:23.220 --> 01:03:30.260
reason I don't want to publicize my distaste for youtube policies is that I know now for sure that

01:03:30.260 --> 01:03:35.460
I'm being scrutinized and I'm fairly certain that all those complaining videos I did back in

01:03:35.460 --> 01:03:42.740
december and january really uh it really rubbed old youtube the wrong way and it was only after

01:03:42.740 --> 01:03:47.860
I stopped that kind of stuff that my channel could finally go back to normal and they actually

01:03:47.860 --> 01:03:52.340
reached out and made contact with me it was like what do I have to gain by making this video

01:03:52.340 --> 01:03:57.300
everyone's already complaining about it and even though I feel like my criticism is still valid

01:03:57.300 --> 01:04:00.900
I just don't feel like there's much to be gained from this I feel like I have a really big

01:04:00.900 --> 01:04:08.420
opportunity here to really work my way up into the inside of youtube to really see the truth of

01:04:08.420 --> 01:04:14.980
how youtube works and I don't want to jeopardize that opportunity just yet I don't know it feels

01:04:14.980 --> 01:04:21.860
like kind of a cop out doesn't it I mean for the past two years I've been so high and mighty about

01:04:22.500 --> 01:04:29.460
speaking my mind at whatever cost but I don't know I just feel different now youtube

01:04:29.460 --> 01:04:37.780
is a huge machine and if you're not careful they will destroy you and as much as I like

01:04:38.420 --> 01:04:44.420
standing up for people that youtube fucks over on this website there comes a point where I just

01:04:44.420 --> 01:04:50.900
end up fucking myself so after thinking about it I decided I'm not gonna upload that rant

01:04:51.460 --> 01:04:56.820
as its own video but at the same time I kind of don't want it to go to waste so I'll probably

01:04:56.820 --> 01:05:03.060
just stick it at the end of this vlog you know I really didn't want to make another video where I

01:05:03.060 --> 01:05:10.420
whine and bitch and moan and complain about youtube I didn't want to be that guy I've been

01:05:10.420 --> 01:05:16.500
holding off on the complaints for about four months now but just this week youtube announced

01:05:16.500 --> 01:05:22.740
something so insanely idiotic that I have to talk about it so last summer I uploaded a video

01:05:22.740 --> 01:05:28.900
called youtube has been on a downward spiral where I basically run down point by point

01:05:28.900 --> 01:05:34.180
everything wrong with youtube today and in that video I talked about how youtube has gradually

01:05:34.180 --> 01:05:41.300
taken steps to take power away from the individual and emphasize content that they want you to see

01:05:41.300 --> 01:05:45.940
so remember when people on youtube actually had to go out and explore the content they wanted

01:05:45.940 --> 01:05:51.700
to watch well not anymore now you can just sit back and relax while the algorithm delivers you

01:05:51.700 --> 01:05:58.020
all the content you should be watching no user input required just click on your home page and

01:05:58.020 --> 01:06:03.380
youtube will recommend you all the videos that they know you like watching oh what's that you

01:06:03.380 --> 01:06:08.100
want to watch your subscriptions you know the channels that you already like for sure to the

01:06:08.100 --> 01:06:13.380
extent that you want to be notified of their future uploads well fuck you you don't know what

01:06:13.380 --> 01:06:19.060
you like but the algorithm does so we're setting your home page to default fuck subscriptions

01:06:19.780 --> 01:06:25.220
well everyone I'm proud to announce that we have reached the end game we have reached the climax

01:06:25.220 --> 01:06:31.780
of Susan W's master plan because youtube has announced that they are experimenting with the

01:06:31.780 --> 01:06:38.740
subscription function the most fundamental basic function that has been a part of this website

01:06:38.740 --> 01:06:44.580
since day one imagine if facebook started experimenting with the friends function

01:06:44.580 --> 01:06:50.660
or if reddit started experimenting with the karma function well that's what youtube is doing with

01:06:50.660 --> 01:06:56.180
subscriptions and of course we all know what they mean by experimenting they're gonna say it's

01:06:56.180 --> 01:07:01.860
optional for a couple of months and then quietly make it mandatory just like they do with every

01:07:01.860 --> 01:07:07.540
change they make so I'm gonna interpret this as a change that has already been made and a decision

01:07:07.540 --> 01:07:13.700
that's already set in stone this is happening it's always been happening and they've just now gone

01:07:13.700 --> 01:07:18.500
public with it because they're gonna release it on everyone in a few months and we all know what

01:07:18.500 --> 01:07:24.180
they're gonna do they're gonna use the subscription feed as yet another vehicle to control the content

01:07:24.180 --> 01:07:29.220
you see they already did it with the home page they already did it with the trending tab they

01:07:29.220 --> 01:07:35.140
already did it with the notification bell the subscription feed was the last bastion that was

01:07:35.140 --> 01:07:40.740
supposedly out of youtube's control and I don't even think that's been true for the past two years

01:07:40.740 --> 01:07:46.420
do you have any idea how many people have messaged me saying that my videos did not appear in their

01:07:46.420 --> 01:07:51.460
subscriptions and I don't think it's a coincidence that most of these claims happened after a stretch

01:07:51.460 --> 01:07:57.540
where I made several videos criticizing youtube so based on that evidence I think youtube has been

01:07:57.540 --> 01:08:02.740
testing out this system for a long time already and they'll tell you the lie that they say for

01:08:02.740 --> 01:08:08.020
every other change they make where they take away personal choice they'll say that they're only

01:08:08.020 --> 01:08:14.020
showing you the content you want to see and that content of course is not governed by your own

01:08:14.020 --> 01:08:21.460
agency but by a machine learning AI that estimates the videos you may or may not be interested in

01:08:21.460 --> 01:08:27.940
and then we get to the real truth of why youtube makes changes like this and let me tell you it's

01:08:27.940 --> 01:08:34.260
sure as hell not to give you the videos you want to see but rather it's to hide the videos that

01:08:34.260 --> 01:08:39.380
they don't want you to see once again they already do this with the home page trending

01:08:39.380 --> 01:08:45.620
recommendations and notifications research has demonstrated that youtube shadow bans mature

01:08:45.620 --> 01:08:50.900
and questionable content from these locations and I'm pretty sure they'll restrict and censor this

01:08:50.900 --> 01:08:56.420
video criticizing them just like they did with my Logan Paul video so be on the lookout for that I

01:08:56.420 --> 01:09:02.900
guess youtube has sunk their claws into almost everything on the whole website and subscriptions

01:09:02.900 --> 01:09:09.140
were the last thing they didn't fully control the last nugget of individual choice that a youtube

01:09:09.140 --> 01:09:14.180
viewer has over the content they want to see subscribe to a user and you'll see their new

01:09:14.180 --> 01:09:21.620
uploads it's as simple as that it's been here since 2005 and yet youtube has become so power

01:09:21.700 --> 01:09:27.780
hungry that they want to wrestle that away from the people too and guess what they already have

01:09:27.780 --> 01:09:34.180
behind our backs as usual this change is going to happen mark my words youtube never back tracks on

01:09:34.180 --> 01:09:40.340
any new feature no matter how unpopular it is and they always try to back it up saying oh well the

01:09:40.340 --> 01:09:47.300
analytics show that trust us we're so smart we're from silicon valley and we're smarter than you

01:09:47.300 --> 01:09:52.180
and the numbers say this is a good idea and that's all anyone cares about on this website

01:09:52.180 --> 01:09:58.740
anymore numbers numbers numbers why do you think there are 10 000 grown ass adults on this website

01:09:58.740 --> 01:10:05.220
who play with toys for a living oh just look at the numbers why do you think Logan Paul felt it

01:10:05.220 --> 01:10:11.620
was necessary to film a dead body and put it on youtube well have you seen the numbers that got

01:10:11.620 --> 01:10:16.340
him and after removing the functionality of subscriptions guess what will happen to

01:10:16.340 --> 01:10:24.420
subscribers on youtube that's right they'll be demoted to just a number hey youtube not everything

01:10:24.420 --> 01:10:31.620
can be measured in numbers and stats and analytics and if you let them govern you they will destroy

01:10:31.620 --> 01:10:37.780
you can you guys put a number on how you have managed to become the single most hated social

01:10:37.780 --> 01:10:43.780
media site on the entire web even worse than facebook there's a site that started chasing

01:10:43.780 --> 01:10:48.900
numbers and three years later mark zuckerberg is seen as a literal reptile and they have to

01:10:48.900 --> 01:10:54.740
spam sappy apology ads on national television there's something to be said about short term

01:10:54.740 --> 01:11:01.220
versus long term growth sure i could film a video of myself drinking a beaker full of sulfuric acid

01:11:01.220 --> 01:11:06.340
and that video would probably have great numbers in the short term but what about the long term

01:11:06.340 --> 01:11:12.260
youtube what about the long term i'm not going to be getting many more views after being dead

01:11:12.260 --> 01:11:17.540
so go ahead youtube keep letting numbers run this website there's no way you could possibly

01:11:17.540 --> 01:11:25.380
end up like facebook or skype or dig or myspace keep treating your users like brain dead toddlers

01:11:25.380 --> 01:11:30.820
who can't decide on their own what videos they want to watch you know what they probably make

01:11:30.820 --> 01:11:36.340
up most of your viewers anyway these days you chased away all of your older dedicated viewers

01:11:36.340 --> 01:11:43.220
by alienating them time and time again when you take subscriptions away from the subscribers

01:11:43.220 --> 01:11:52.100
you take the you out of youtube now it's just a two
