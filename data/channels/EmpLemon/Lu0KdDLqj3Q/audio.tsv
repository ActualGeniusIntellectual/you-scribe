0	25720	Hey what's up guys, EpicVlogger52 here with another cool vlog.
25720	30560	Hi everyone, what's happening?
30560	44760	As you can see it's currently 9.35 on a Saturday, today is April 28th, 2018.
44760	54400	What's up everyone, it's big boy vlogger Joey YouTube 68 here with another epic vlog about
54400	56160	my life.
56160	64920	Currently we are watching the NBA playoffs and uh, I don't know, what am I doing?
64920	67840	What is this content that you clicked on, presumably?
67840	73880	Aha, you see, because that's the long game, that's what you gotta do when you're a YouTuber,
73880	77280	because right now, right now it's the present.
77280	81180	Right now it's the present and I'm just recording this with my camera.
81180	88600	But presumably I'm going to edit this content and upload it, and by then it'll be the future.
88600	90740	So hello future people.
90740	98620	So yeah, watching some sports, a lot of people like to pass their time by watching uh, TV
98620	107060	shows or anime, uh but that kind of stuff has never really appealed to me, I'm more
107060	111220	of a sports kind of guy, heck yeah, sports.
111220	122420	We got uh, we got Boston, Boston playing Milwaukee in the playoffs, the NBA first round, Eastern
122420	132180	Conference playoffs, big time basketball going on here, game seven, win or go home.
133180	139860	Man this is absolutely riveting stuff right here, welcome back to another EmperorLemon
139860	146700	live vlog reaction video, where today we're reacting to the playoffs.
146700	153260	By the time this series is over, the NBA playoffs will be over, and um, we'll know who the champion
153260	159460	is, who's it going to be, is it going to be Golden State, is it going to be Houston?
159740	169740	Well uh, currently I'm about to record audio for uh, Minute Memes, Minute Memes, Minute
169740	175460	Minute Minute Memes, haven't done a Minute Memes in a while, um, but yeah here's the
175460	180780	process, I typed everything up in a Google Doc, I'm a script boy, as one YouTube commenter
180780	194100	put it, and uh, another news today, interesting stuff going on with my boy CeeLo, CeeLoGreen,
194100	201220	that was a very stupid comment, but he follows me, I think that's new, he follows me, back,
202100	211380	CeeLo, CeeLo, a good boy, he uh, he does a bunch of research into how YouTube works,
211380	217620	really um, really instrumental in kind of understanding, helping YouTubers understand
217620	226420	the modern workings of YouTube, because everyone knows YouTube's not going to tell us anything.
226420	234900	Today there's actually a reported anomaly, it's an anomaly folks, people are losing subscribers,
234900	243220	but um, yeah it's only uh, it's only big boy, baddie, curse word channels, and not uh, not
243220	251260	kitty kid fun toy channels, also Jake and Logan Paul, you see being a YouTuber is a
251260	259700	lot like dealing with stuff like this, um, YouTube is a huge, huge site, and there's
259700	268060	always a ton of stuff going on that no one has any idea, well that's pretty much all
268060	273700	that happened to me, mine is 41, but yeah be sure to subscribe and help me make my subscriber
273700	278340	videos, and like this video guys, good bye!
278340	287340	Hi everyone, me again, uh, well yeah of course it's me again, who else could it be, I'm the
287340	295780	only one editing this, nevermind, um, just uh, just having a live look in at the fun
295780	303820	recording process, so I got everything uh, I got everything all dialed up, Audacity,
303820	311220	the script, it's currently 10-12pm, and this video will be um, this video will be edited
311220	322460	down to about 2 minutes, 2 minutes 20 seconds, let's say that, um, hey what's up guys, it's
322460	333820	me again, and uh, what I'm doing here is making a timer for minute memes, that's right,
333820	344020	I'm here in the uh, I'm here in the text, the text function of Vegas, and um, I'm going
344020	353060	through one by one, adding the numbers, cause that's how dedicated I am, to making good
353060	363940	content, I will go, I will jump through the hoops, if it means making a final product,
363940	370980	that looks good, this new, this new minute memes, it's kinda got a football type, football
370980	379500	John Madden, big time football aesthetic, so, the thing with that um, the thing with
379500	388740	that style, I'm making the timer have a scoreboard look, and I looked online for just a scoreboard
388740	409460	timer, and all of them kind of suck, so I'd rather make my own, man nobody watches NASCAR,
409460	416300	you know like, in all the years I went to school, all the kids I ever met, I probably
416300	425740	met like two others who watched NASCAR, um, I definitely think it's one of those things
425740	432560	that was a lot more popular in the 90's, cause only 90's kids will remember when NASCAR was
432560	444380	popular, just online, it's basically non-existent, it has no online presence, because uh, young
444380	455780	people don't watch NASCAR, except for me, I will admit that, a lot of NASCAR races,
455780	464420	it's not something you're really glued to the TV set for a while, um, races like Talladega
464420	470620	are very exciting though, just because of the way they tune the cars for this specific
470620	478480	track, it encourages pack racing, and at any moment a huge crash can come and take out
478480	488620	like half the field, um, oh, big crash, see, that's what I was talking about, this style
488620	495780	of racing is really unpredictable, who's gonna win, there's ten laps left, can you tell who's
495780	504700	gonna win, leave a comment below if you think you know who's going to win, I'm just kidding,
504700	514060	that finish sucked, fuck NASCAR, hey what's up guys, it's me again, it is currently Monday
514060	522100	afternoon, let's see what's going on in the world right now and let's react to it, so
522100	533700	uh, the top story right now, oh Marvel, them superheroes, very, very interesting, I definitely
533700	545540	care a lot about superhero movies, um, superheroes are cool and they stop the world from getting
545540	552240	destroyed and there definitely aren't enough superhero movies, so we need more through
552240	563280	2025, let's see what else, the Avengers and the spoilers, the infinite Avengers infinity
563280	579280	superhero movies, the world's gonna get destroyed, Trump, celebrity died, Sonic, superhero Avengers
579280	595160	superhero, that's pretty cool I guess, someone fucked up, oh no, rapper died, well somebody died,
595160	604280	I'm sorry, am I too callous, this one's in a big block so you know it's important, I should
604280	611320	probably read some of the stuff on the on the right side of the page, oh epic prank, you can
611320	624040	make Siri curse, that's so epic, that's so LMAO, some people made a Lego tree, a tree made of Legos,
624040	632840	you know what, good for them, now here's the thing that's been going on recently, kind of just
633080	643040	another excuse for people to get outraged for no reason, celebrity cool, celebrities are cool,
643040	651520	oh wow Logan Paul and he's in a big box so you know it's important, Logan Paul is quitting, oh no,
651520	660100	what will YouTube do without him, millennials, marketing millennials, millennial, millennial
660100	666540	Trump, millennials, hey millennials, we need a market to you, buy our products because you're
666540	670980	Millennials, I mean millennials, the thing about Millennials is they love getting called
670980	679060	Millennials and Millennials, we need a market to them, howdy fellow Millennials, are you guys
679060	689620	having fun being Millennials, oh epic, epic, roast, the woods, the Trump, the White House
689620	697540	correspondent, oh she was so epic and she roasted the evil Republicans, it's so funny, oh even more
697540	706460	coverage on the epic roast, they roasted, oh that's actually something positive about Trump,
706460	713860	okay we don't need to, we don't need to hear about any of that, we are now rendering the video,
713860	725060	my child, my son is being born, listen to the power, I don't know if the microphones picking
725060	734940	it up but if it is then listen to the power of the rendering, this is pure bits, zeros and ones
734940	741940	getting put into their place, rendering has completed, now that the video is rendered we
741940	747780	can begin the most difficult process of being a YouTuber and that's making a YouTube thumbnail,
747780	757100	so I already have a little tab here cued up with my boy John Madden, I don't know, I struggle,
757100	762820	I spend more time on my thumbnails than on the videos themselves you know because they're that
762860	769700	important, like I got to follow in the footsteps of the big YouTubers because how am I gonna make
769700	775820	my channel grow up being strong if I don't have thumbnails like these guys, okay so you got to
775820	783740	have a bunch of a bunch of goobers going, oh look at this, I'm reacting to this, oh what's this,
783740	795380	oh look at me, I'm reacting to this thing, oh what's this, a Pokeball, a Pokeball, I'm so
795380	805740	surprised, hmm, why does this have a watermark, now these are some high quality reaction images
805740	813780	picked fresh from the fresh garden of fortune, this looks like a good one, just riveting content
813780	824140	you're watching right here, all right so we got our boy in here, now it's time to add some epic
824140	834220	text, at last my masterpiece is complete, all right well now that the thumbnail is complete
834220	853020	it's time to upload the video, so exciting, now that the video is public, time to check some
853020	866220	YouTube comments, Ripper Jack says yay, he's happy that I uploaded the video, yay to you Ripper,
866220	881620	my people, my people, look at my people, man isn't being a YouTuber great, oh look everyone it's a
881660	893220	new meme, get it while it's hot, new meme everyone, gosh I wonder if this will still be around in like
893220	899820	three months when I upload this video, I think it'll be gone in a couple of days, what's up
899820	911820	everybody it's May 1st 2018, Tuesday May 1st, so yesterday I uploaded my video, my big boy,
911820	923100	big time meme, epic, epic meme video, it's about 18 hours later and we're at 46,000 views,
923100	932500	whoopity-doo, it's actually a probably, probably better than most of my videos do after that
932500	940340	amount of time, a couple of other interesting happenings going on, internet historian, my boy,
940340	947980	sent me the in the field we worked on, so it's currently not live yet, I'm getting an extra
947980	961300	special preview of myself, another one of my boys, Mum Key Jones, he came out with his actual Diary
961300	969860	of a Wimpy Kid, Elliot Rogers parody and I actually think I'm gonna purchase this, support
970100	978940	my fellow creators on YouTube, I mean no one else, there's not really anyone else on YouTube who
978940	989980	makes content like Mum Key, all right Mum Key, I'm spending $20, 20 buckaronis, like that's like
989980	996620	three days of YouTube income for me, I'm spending all of that on your book, so it better be good,
996620	1007180	and if it's not, I'll probably just complain, hi everyone, Killer Keemstar here, the king of
1007180	1014420	YouTube drama and are we witnessing the end of Logan Paul's entire career, look at that ratio,
1014420	1026420	look at that ratio, it's the last, the last of the sailors on the Logan Paul ship, they're trying
1026420	1035940	trying to salvage everything, but it's it's a losing battle, I mean just look at look at these
1035940	1046100	numbers, you just got twittered, your opinion means nothing because of the ratio man, this is the end,
1046100	1055140	this is the point of no return, Logan Paul has gone so far down the spiral that he can never
1055380	1069780	emerge, this meme is everywhere, all right, gonna do it, we're gonna do it, God, all right this is
1069780	1074300	it right here, this is for all the marbles, here we go, oh,
1085140	1096500	Infinity War meme is dead, now everyone, everyone, everyone post this meme, you know what,
1096500	1105980	this meme is pretty good, I think I might make a video on it, goop videos was the first one to
1105980	1115980	make this meme, rev up those fryers cuz I am sure hungry to make a new meme, all right guys let's
1115980	1128740	make an Emperor lemon video right here, quick I gotta render my meme before anyone else steals my
1128740	1138220	idea, oh wait a minute someone did my idea already, guess I have to delete my account now,
1138220	1147620	all right now that the fucking lame obvious child's play version of the joke is online,
1147620	1153140	we can get down to business and make a real version of this meme,
1159660	1166420	ah now that's more like it, hey shut up idiot everyone knows Vsauce makes the best memes,
1166420	1173900	whoa all this new meme excitement and there's a new death grips, slow down I'm gonna spurt,
1180700	1187260	well guys it's been like an hour and a half but I'm finally done, I masked the thing,
1187260	1197140	this is a productive use of my time, man isn't it beautiful, a lot of time went into that,
1197140	1205380	that's how much I care about making good content right there, all right so let's see what we can
1205380	1234580	do with this, ah now that is some quality content, hi everyone it's me,
1234780	1242700	just checking in here and a little news stories trending on Twitter, so we're gonna check that
1242700	1249380	out right now, oh so it turns out University of Florida the school I go to is a racist,
1249380	1257900	the KKK are running University of Florida, they're nailing crosses in front of all the dormitories
1257900	1266060	and they're burning them, there's just massive lynching activity going on at UF, so I should
1266060	1278140	probably explain the context of this incident because context in fact does matter, so here's
1278140	1287100	what happened as far as I know, so it's May, it's a end of the semester, graduation season
1287100	1293940	for seniors in college, a couple of the graduates they wanted to do a little dance planned and
1293940	1301020	choreographed, a little bit of a dance, I guess the I guess it went against the university etiquette
1301020	1307740	or whatever and they were having none of that, so they yanked them off the stage, I know I think
1307740	1314860	they should have been allowed to dance, I think that course of disciplinary action was a little
1314860	1321020	bit rigid, a little antiquated, it's a big moment for them, let them dance, like their whole life
1321020	1329140	has been leading up to this big graduation and like I don't really mind that, but that's pretty
1329140	1336820	much where the story should end, yet somehow because the authority figure on stage was a white
1336900	1348500	man and the quote unquote victims were black young adults, the media has interpreted and spun and
1348500	1358100	labeled this story as a racially charged offense, you can argue about the discipline all you want
1358100	1365660	okay, you can argue about the discipline, is it a disciplinary issue, yes sure, debate all you want
1365700	1372700	about the discipline and the force they used, but to sit there and call this a racial issue
1372700	1380900	is beyond misleading. To demonstrate my point even further, let's just let's just look at these
1380900	1387820	headlines, several black University of Florida graduates yanked offstage, university response
1387820	1394420	to charges of racism from Good Morning America, Good Morning America, here's another reason why
1394420	1402460	you guys are racist, black University of Florida students, after several black graduates, what I'm
1402460	1408340	saying is that you shouldn't present these issues racially when they're clearly not racially
1408340	1414780	motivated okay, like why can't it just be students, well because then you can't spin it as a racial
1414780	1420620	issue and no one will click on your story, so that's why they do it, to get clicks, but it's
1420620	1428460	just damaging for society. ABC News, now this is big boy journalism old school but this is another
1428460	1435660	thing to do, it was definitely contingent on a race one student tells, yeah so the opinion of
1435660	1443380	one student is is just valuable enough to put in in the headline of the tweet, he said this, he said
1443380	1450660	she said, one one person out of a thousand said this, let's put it in our headline, because once
1450660	1457140	again you got to spin it, this is American journalism 2018, University of Florida forced
1457140	1463460	to apologize after black and minority graduates were shoved off the stage by whites, why does this
1463460	1468900	have to be a racial issue, well it's obvious why so that people will get mad and click on their
1468900	1474980	article, but I guarantee you in two more weeks I'll be back with another story where the media
1474980	1484260	does this, I guarantee it. All right so allow me to elaborate for a bit on why journalism like this
1484260	1491540	is just so bad and so damaging for society, so what it basically what it basically does it creates
1491540	1498660	a vicious cycle, so the cycle goes a little something like this, there's an event that
1498660	1506340	happens and it happens to contain a white authority figure and a black victim okay,
1507220	1512900	doesn't matter what the event is, the context doesn't matter at all, media picks up on it,
1512900	1518820	they frame it as a racial issue, people see it, they're outraged, they have they develop this
1518820	1526260	perception of society that everything is racist and then when an event like that happens again
1526980	1531780	they interpret it as racist and it gets picked up by the news again and the cycle continues.
1531780	1538420	There are many ways to look at something and interpret it, you could look at the sun
1538980	1545460	with no context of how the universe works and believe that the sun revolves around the earth,
1546180	1553860	but that doesn't exactly make it true, context matters okay. Let me give you another example,
1553860	1560500	a news company can report on vaccinating children and they can title the article
1561460	1568100	geriatric rich white men want to stick sharp needles inside of your children,
1568100	1575140	yeah it's actually true but just the fact that you have completely ignored the context of the
1575220	1582900	situation means that you are creating a false perception for the public, that's problematic,
1583620	1588980	we shouldn't have a society where people are led to believe that everything around them is
1588980	1594100	inherently racist, it's very unstable, would you rather have that or a society where people get
1594100	1598980	along? I definitely want the second one, I don't know about some of these people, I don't know,
1599700	1606340	it's like they want society to be more divided which is obviously it's in complete contradiction
1606340	1612260	to their whole message of anti-racism but I feel like that's what a lot of these people want,
1612260	1619700	they want to keep Americans divided and fighting among each other so that they can ignore actual
1619700	1624580	issues that if they were to be reported on would harm the rich and powerful, it's like why would
1624580	1632820	you want to cherry pick and nitpick and comb through society and identify every single instance
1632820	1637540	possible, it's like not even confirmed, the vast vast vast majority of these cases that report in
1637540	1643540	the media they're non-race issues and they get labeled as race issues, why would you want to go
1643540	1650340	through and cherry pick every single little example you can from America, a country of 320
1650340	1656660	million people, millions of interactions going on every second around the country and you find one,
1656660	1663700	you find one thing that you contort into a racial issue and you blow it up and say whoa whoa look
1663700	1670340	this is evidence, look we're right, look how racist America is and I just don't see it and for
1670900	1675620	most people, most readers, most readers of those news articles that's the end of it, they don't,
1676580	1683860	it's solidified in stone for them, a University of Florida racist, of course this news story
1683860	1690900	it's just going to be forgotten about but I don't know, I chose this specific example to talk about
1691700	1701540	because like I go to UF, it's not run by racist people okay and the fact that the media has taken
1701540	1710020	this tiny little incident and blown it up to a story of national prominence, it really shows how
1710020	1716740	they just care more about justifying their agenda than they do about presenting reality, I guess
1716740	1722820	what I'm trying to say is that these stories do a lot more harm than good, they turn people against
1722820	1730500	each other, make racial groups hate each other and I don't think that's good for society.
1731540	1754020	Hi everybody, it's Wednesday morning and I'm fucking pissed, what you're seeing here is a
1754980	1764660	fully monetized YouTube video which is a plane crash compilation, an actual compilation
1765700	1776900	of plane crashes in real life, it's running seven ads, seven ad placements on a plane crash
1777700	1786500	compilation, this is, this might be one of the worst things I've ever seen on YouTube,
1786500	1793540	you obviously have the main principle of profiting off of hundreds of people's deaths
1794340	1804180	but not only that, you have the fucking audacity to put on your stupid fucking After Effects
1805060	1812740	epic YouTuber intro on content that you literally just re-uploaded from the website so it's not even
1812740	1818340	original content and you put on your fucking After Effects intro, you load up the video with
1818340	1825140	seven ads and you make money off of nine million views and YouTube has done fucking nothing about
1825140	1836020	this, god damn it man, just god damn it, why is this website so fucking fucked up and I've tried,
1836020	1840740	I've tried for the past four months or so not to not complain about YouTube,
1841860	1848580	they've tried communicating better, they tried fixing the monetization system but then I just
1848580	1856740	see shit like this and it's like we haven't left square fucking one, what the fuck YouTube,
1857700	1865220	plane crash compilation fully monetized, how the fuck does a plane crash compilation slip under
1865220	1874580	the radar, I don't understand what you people are doing, fully monetized, seven ad placements
1874580	1882180	on a plane crash compilation, not a fictional plane crash compilation, real actual footage
1883220	1890660	not unlike the footage you'd find on live leak, the difference being that this person
1890660	1900580	is earning thousands of dollars of revenue from hundreds of people dying, dying, Logan Paul filmed
1900580	1907620	one dead guy and the collective internet flipped their shit but meanwhile you have people uploading
1907620	1915060	footage of hundreds of people dying, dying, not already dead like Logan did, dying,
1915940	1926340	your fucking system somehow sees that as perfectly okay, how, how come every respectable commentary
1926340	1932340	channel on YouTube has basically been shadow banned and demonetized and kicked down the pecking
1932340	1938980	order and scrutinized as hard as they possibly fucking can by your fucking automated system
1938980	1945460	for the past 18 months, meanwhile plane crash compilation, oh that's perfectly fine, loaded up
1945460	1952100	with ads, I usually don't get this angry about anything, politics I don't really care that much,
1953060	1962660	whatever but when I see a system that is just so fundamentally unfair as YouTube's monetization
1962660	1968740	system is, I lose my fucking shit, they tell us all the rules, they tell us all the rules over
1968740	1974500	and over again and hammer it into our heads, don't do this, don't do that, and even if you follow
1974500	1980820	those rules there's a 50-50 chance that your video is just going to get demonetized anyway because
1980900	1986420	they blacklisted your channel or something like they've done with mine where they don't send out
1986420	1991300	your videos to recommendations or notifications or subscriptions, they've done it to me,
1991860	1998660	they've drug my channel and a bunch of other people's through the fucking mud because we
1998660	2006020	dare speak up about this bullshit, they turn their back away from plane crash compilations,
2006660	2013460	it's like you can't make this shit up, we are in the dystopian present on YouTube, this is their
2013460	2020660	end game, this is what all the fucking shit, all the changes, all the make your videos longer,
2020660	2025860	more and more and more content, oh but don't make original content, we'll shit on you for that,
2025860	2032100	oh but if you're re-uploading someone else's content and it just happens to be plane crashes
2032100	2037780	and you put it all back to back and you have a fucking after effects intro with obnoxious EDM
2037780	2046180	music, that's perfectly fine, this is their end game I guess, they made YouTube inhospitable for
2047220	2053940	original content, they made YouTube inhospitable for talent, they don't emphasize any of that on
2053940	2060740	YouTube anymore, it's all about oh how long can you make, oh how much watch time, who gives a fuck
2060740	2067060	about watch time okay, and I'll tell you why they do it is because the more time you spend on
2067060	2073860	YouTube the less time you spend on a competitor site like Facebook, but even so what has this
2073860	2081540	done to the content on YouTube, I know I made a whole 49 minute video about this talking about
2081540	2087060	the consequences of all this shit, but we're there, this is as bad as I've ever seen YouTube
2087060	2096100	content okay, monetizing plane crash tragedies, plane crash compilations, like I still can't
2096100	2101940	fucking believe it, but it's the video is right there still running ads on it, how the fuck is it
2102740	2110820	morally consistent to just scrub YouTube from gun content, but oh plane crash compilations,
2110820	2117460	that's perfectly fine, god I just don't understand this website, it's like they never
2117460	2125060	learn, they never learn, Elsa gate, child endangerment, oh we're gonna get rid of that
2125060	2132180	content once it starts, once the ads start pulling out, Logan Paul suicide victim, the worst PR
2132180	2140340	disaster for YouTube ever, certainly ever, and they still won't police this shit, and I said this on
2140340	2148740	Twitter, how the fuck, how the fuck does a video titled airplane crash compilation not immediately
2148740	2156740	set up a million alarms in the demonetization system, how is that not set off a million red flags
2157380	2162820	just instantly demonetize this video, but now it's been up there, the video is like a year old,
2162820	2169140	it's like eight months old, running seven ads, nine million views, probably made
2170020	2176180	a couple thousand bucks off of that content, I've moved past the idea of complaining about the idea
2176180	2183700	of demonetization, okay, if YouTube wants to implement a system where they only put ads on
2184580	2188820	family-friendly content, then whatever, but if you put in a system like that,
2188820	2196340	you have to, have to, have to, absolutely have to enforce it fairly, I just hate being treated
2196340	2203940	unfairly, it's not just me, it's every YouTuber, gaming channels, commentary channels,
2203940	2208180	pretty much every YouTuber that tries to put an effort into their content these days gets
2208180	2214580	fucking sandbagged, and I'd be okay with that, I'd be okay with that, they just did it with everyone,
2214580	2221620	maybe it's people, maybe it's not YouTube, maybe it's just people that are just so morally
2221620	2231300	inconsistent about everything, I mean Logan Paul uploaded a video of one dead guy, one guy who
2231300	2237060	already died and the internet lost their collective shit over it, and I'm not saying people don't care
2237060	2242580	about this, but I know that video had nine million views by the time I watched it and never heard a
2242580	2249620	peep about it, and it has hundreds of people dying, not already deceased, dying, and Logan
2249620	2256100	Paul's video wasn't monetized, I mean YouTube did put that shit on trending, but like Logan Paul
2256100	2264580	didn't monetize the video, this guy, plane crash compilation dude, seven ad placements on a video
2264580	2272580	showcasing the deaths of hundreds of people, I know it's just astonishing, and my little tweet
2272580	2278900	about it will probably get a couple thousand likes and a few hundred retweets and that'll be the end
2278900	2287300	of it and everyone will forget about it, I mean no more, no massive outrage over the plane crash
2287300	2295380	compilation, it's literally the same principle but a hundred times worse, but will people care,
2295380	2301940	will YouTube make a sappy apology for this, will anything even happen to that video, will I check
2301940	2307860	back in six weeks and that video will still be breaking in that revenue, I don't know,
2309060	2315700	I don't know, surprise me YouTube, surprise me okay, I just want to say one more thing before
2315700	2322340	I end this rant, YouTube and a lot of people probably wonder why YouTube is so hated,
2323060	2330020	because I don't know if you've checked the internet in the past eight months, but YouTube is hated,
2330660	2338260	they're hated more than any other social network, they're hated, they're hated to the extent
2338260	2344820	that someone actually got pissed off enough at them to break into their headquarters and shoot
2344820	2353220	up the place, I'm not saying it's justified, no it sucks and it's a fucking deranged lunatic,
2354100	2359940	but I don't know, it's just a testament, it's a testament to this hole that YouTube has dug
2359940	2368980	themselves in where people hate them, people go fucking postal because of how bad YouTube has been
2368980	2376100	over the past couple of years and they wonder why, they wonder why and it's not because YouTubers
2376100	2384340	are entitled, it's not because millennials are lazy, no it's because of inconsistent unfair
2384340	2391460	bullshit like this, where they police and scrutinize every chicken little thing from
2391460	2398820	one tiny part of YouTube and they just let plane crash compilations soak in the revenue regardless,
2399460	2405220	it's okay, it's this type of shit that drives people fucking mental and they need to fix it,
2406180	2412740	how much longer, how much longer are we gonna have to endure a system like either, either let
2412740	2419780	everyone run ads or take the ads off fucking plane crashes okay and it's not just the, and don't think
2419780	2425060	I'm just making this video about one video, it's like, it's like if you find a roach in your house
2425060	2431380	there's probably a hundred other roaches around, there's probably tens of thousands of videos like
2431380	2441220	this, fucking shitty compilations that rake in revenue from stolen content and in these specific
2441220	2450580	cases rake in revenue from literally showcasing the tragedies and death and slaughter of hundreds
2450580	2456900	of people and I just wanna say YouTube wonders why they're the most hated website on the internet,
2456900	2462020	it's because of shit like this and until they fix it, it's not gonna change,
2463620	2469940	people are still gonna hate them, just want to let you guys know that after the whole Logan Paul
2469940	2477060	thing, YouTube really has been trying to improve their communication, they're basically responding
2477060	2485940	to every knucklehead that pings them, even 13 year olds with 2,000 subscribers and yet despite
2486500	2498020	all of these responses and even though after I tweeted to them that their platform is running ads
2498900	2506660	on a plane crash compilation, they didn't say shit about it and like dozens of people,
2506660	2515220	dozens of people pinged YouTube at Team YouTube at YT Creators, like a dozen people pinged them
2515220	2524180	and no response, radio silence, they might have me blocked or something, yeah it's very clear that
2524740	2532260	they're not interested in hearing what I have to say, so whatever, oh man it looks like all
2532260	2538660	my complaining finally paid off, this is just a reminder to everyone out there that if you
2538660	2546180	complain hard enough and you shitpost long enough, good things will happen, what's up everybody,
2548020	2556500	looks like Mumkey's book finally came in the mail, looks like we got an unboxing video to do,
2557140	2566980	all right so as you can see there is a box and it's taped up pretty tightly so
2567780	2573860	I think I'm gonna have to go get some scissors, all right everyone I got the scissors,
2574580	2584500	snip snip, all right we're gonna work on cutting open the tape now, in case you didn't know I'm
2584500	2594660	left-handed, that's what makes me special, all right so god fucking right-handed normies,
2594660	2600660	they think they're so cool with their right hand, I don't know, me making 90% of people,
2600660	2609060	fucking normies, try that shit open, all right so as you can see Mumkey sent me some bubble wrap
2609620	2622980	to complement the book, shipping information, aha and the piece of resistance,
2623860	2632420	look at it, look at the glory, look how glorious this product is that I ordered,
2632420	2641140	oh it's so shiny, this thing is shiny as fuck, man I can't wait to delve into the literary
2641140	2647860	adventure that Mumkey has provided for me on this fine day, what's up everybody, it's about a week
2648660	2654980	later, didn't really feel like recording anything for the last seven days, yeah so the reason I
2654980	2664020	haven't been making anything is because I have been writing, researching and recording this 20
2664020	2673060	page script, this might end up being the longest video I've ever made and it might end up being
2673060	2679220	the best video I've ever made, I should probably get you guys back up to speed on current events
2679220	2684180	because there's no way you know them yourself so it's up to me to tell you and remind you,
2684740	2690820	all right so this image basically sums up the new memes that have been circulating over the past
2690820	2699780	week, oh and this morning there is another school shooting in America, what's up everybody it's me
2699780	2709780	again here with another fantastic backyard commentary, first let me just say that I haven't
2709780	2720260	been vlogging as much because I don't know everything's just been really boring, I've been
2720260	2729140	hard at work editing the new youtube geographic, it's gonna be a big boy, big time, big ticket
2729140	2735940	video, game changer, game changing video, I don't know it's probably gonna come out after the first
2735940	2747060	part of this vlog so be prepared for that, all right so it is currently may 22nd 2018
2748340	2756420	and the news recently there's been a lot of talk, a lot of talk about the old school shootings,
2756420	2763380	school shootings, a lot of conversation about school shootings, every time you hear the issue
2763380	2773220	of school shootings mentioned in the news all they talk about is gun gun gun gun gun gun rifle
2773220	2784820	gun gun gun assault weapon gun nra gun gun rifle gun and usually the times when gun control as an
2784820	2793300	issue is discussed most frequently is immediately following a school shooting, it's a very evocative
2793540	2800980	issue which is why every time there is a school shooting in America it gets reported on like
2800980	2809940	crazy and it becomes the single most salient issue for the next week at least and obviously it's a
2809940	2817300	problem that everyone wants to stop and I'm pretty sure no one whether you're Republican or Democrat
2817300	2824580	or an independent no one thinks there should be more school shootings but by that same token
2824580	2829220	everyone wants to scramble for a solution as soon as the school shooting happens the
2829220	2838740	discussion immediately gets pinned and imprisoned in the idea that guns are the primary issue
2838740	2843780	and throughout all the news coverage throughout all the discussion all the arguments you see on
2843780	2851700	twitter on youtube throughout all of it I don't know I've never seen anyone discuss what I think
2851700	2857780	is the real issue in school shootings and that issue I believe is the schools the issue with
2857780	2865300	school shootings is schools now before I talk about this I want you all to just completely
2865300	2872500	forget about guns okay just completely wipe guns from your mind whenever there's a school shooting
2872500	2881380	like this it always happens with a very troubled kid and instead of just blaming the idea of guns
2881380	2889460	or people who enable guns it's far far far more important in my opinion to consider what
2889460	2896500	circumstances caused this kid to bring a loaded gun to school and start shooting his classmates
2896500	2902180	because I don't know if you people have noticed either if you're too old you're too young or
2902180	2910820	you're not from America but schools in America suck okay I live in the state of Florida
2912100	2919380	and the school district I went to is supposedly the best in the state of Florida and you want to
2919380	2927300	know what it still sucks just completely unstimulating to the actual concept of education
2927860	2934340	just miserable kids all over the place nobody wants to be there especially once you get closer
2934340	2940340	to the age of 18 no one wants to be there if you look at all these kids all these school shooters
2941220	2948180	they all have certain things in common first of all they're usually very anti-social or socially
2948180	2955380	awkward and most of them have a history of being bullied by their classmates now schools in America
2955380	2963780	they'll pretend they'll say all these things about wanting to stop bullying but in reality
2963780	2969700	it's completely unenforceable and there's nothing they can really do about it and a lot of things
2969700	2976500	that people don't understand because either they've been too far removed from school or
2976500	2982660	they're in school and they've just accepted it as normality and they don't know any other way
2982660	2990660	of life one thing that these people rarely notice is that kids are vicious okay pretty much between
2990660	2998500	the age of 10 and 18 these kids are absolutely vicious obviously it's very easy to look at young
2998500	3006420	kids and young teens and imagine that they are very innocent little harmless defenseless victims
3006420	3012180	but I don't know this is just coming from me just observing how people act and I was in school
3012660	3019300	two years ago and this is how people are the problem with kids and early teens is that they
3019300	3028180	have no concept of morality they either have no concept or a very remedial concept of morality
3028180	3033940	and this is just this is just an aspect of psychology where your brain is literally not
3033940	3041300	finished developing in how to deal with ethics and morals and it's important to remember that
3041300	3047140	because kids most of them and there's a lot of nice ones but there's a lot of ones that
3047140	3052900	are completely vicious and this isn't just this isn't a new thing this is a part of every
3052900	3060740	generation so kids in school they're highly conscientious they care so much about appearance
3060740	3069060	and hierarchy and status there's so much peer pressure to conform to societal norms and the
3069060	3078260	alternative is being ridiculed and cast aside as an outcast what I'm basically saying is that
3078260	3084580	it's just very natural for kids to sort of relentlessly pick on other kids that don't fit in
3085780	3092500	and I just think that there's this huge disconnect in our society with how we treat introverted
3092500	3101300	people and it's very ironic because we live in an age where schools and bureaucrats and politicians
3101300	3110100	will bend over backwards to accommodate any person that they to accommodate anyone who we view as a
3110100	3117220	victim based on only physical traits however the great irony in all of this is that you have
3117220	3125700	somehow ignored and continued to ignore the huge monumental difference between introverted kids
3125700	3131940	and extroverted kids and this is coming again from someone who growing up in school was very
3131940	3138660	introverted found it very hard to talk to people and it's not just it's not just something you can
3138660	3145300	easily just pick up and uh we just throw you in with all these people you make friends it's not
3145300	3154100	like that and I think a lot of the problems that come with schools and behavior in 21st century
3154100	3161460	America is a fundamental misunderstanding of how introverted people think and act and it's a pretty
3161460	3169220	alarming problem because if you really think about it logically pretty much everyone in power at not
3169220	3175540	just schools but in the government are going to be extroverted people like it's just a matter of
3176180	3181300	natural selection a clammy introverted guy who doesn't talk to anyone is going to be far less
3181300	3190900	likely to succeed in a political campaign so based on that fact pretty much everyone in politics all
3190900	3198740	of our lawmakers they have to be extroverted people and the same theory applies to teachers
3198820	3206340	faculty people who in their job description they have to work and interact with people all day
3206340	3212180	they're naturally going to be more extroverted people and what that's created in our society
3212180	3219220	at least I feel it's a huge rift between the extroverted and the empowered people in our
3219220	3227140	society growing up and introverted people who feel like they have no one to turn to
3228020	3231860	because if you think about it from the perspective of an introverted person growing up in school
3232500	3237860	like what are they going to do if they have a problem naturally the course of action in
3237860	3244420	all these cases oh go talk to the teacher go talk to the guidance counselor but these teachers and
3244420	3250580	guidance counselors they're extroverted people and they don't understand the mentality of being
3250900	3257540	introverted it's a real shame because our school system treats introverted people
3257540	3264100	so unbelievably poorly and they are completely oblivious to that fact I don't know if this
3264660	3271300	concept resonates with any of you out there who may be introverted people have trouble
3271300	3278260	talking to people in public or socially awkward and you remember growing up in school and they
3278260	3285220	force you they force you to do all these activities group work group projects bonding
3285780	3292020	activities and all of this is by the design of extroverted people who think everyone in
3292020	3298100	the world is extroverted when that's simply not true and when you force introverted kids
3298100	3304500	place themselves in social situations with which they're uncomfortable or to do these activities
3304500	3311620	where you force them to interact with people they don't care for you create a recipe for a very
3311620	3319780	miserable individual and it's a lot of these individuals who eventually grow up to become
3319780	3327060	the prototypical school shooter and I'm not saying it's justified at all obviously these people have
3327060	3334260	been pushed to a point where they have mentally gone off the deep end and their actions are no
3334260	3343780	longer governed by reason or morality so I'm not trying to sympathize with school shooters at all
3343780	3348740	but at the same time it's very important to understand where some of these kids are coming
3348740	3358900	from these are socially awkward anti-social kids who are forced by our society to spend six hours
3358900	3367300	a day five days a week 180 days a year in an environment where they are constantly uncomfortable
3368260	3374500	and once again the vast majority of people in our society they don't understand this point of view
3374500	3380980	because when you're extroverted and it's about 70 percent of people you don't feel this constant
3380980	3386260	pressure and this constant anxiety when you're in public it just doesn't make sense and you can't
3386260	3392900	wrap your head around it and you can't develop empathy for these people and when you're growing
3392900	3399860	up in school the majority of people just turn that idea of them acting different into ostracizing them
3399860	3407860	and excluding them and it just makes things a lot worse so I guess my point with all this is that
3408660	3415620	we need to understand and treat introverted people a lot better and I think when we do we will see
3416260	3421140	a vast reduction in school shootings if you think about these kids if you think about
3421140	3429220	the Houston shooter if you think about Nicholas Cruz why are we as a society
3430260	3437780	forcing these kids who clearly do not belong in a social situation and every time they're
3437780	3445060	exposed to a situation it worsens their emotional state why are we forcing kids like this to go to
3445060	3452420	school and be in an environment they hate I don't understand especially now that we have online
3452420	3461220	school and there's so much of an opportunity for virtual school and I don't buy in to this
3461220	3467220	expectation that if you don't make friends if you don't get along with people then you're not going
3467220	3472180	to have a good time as an adult you know well first of all these introverted antisocial kids
3472180	3478260	they're not having a good time as a child okay and it's not a matter of just making friends it's
3478260	3484900	an actual mental block and I've experienced it I'm sure a lot of you have experienced it or it's not
3484900	3489620	just the thing where you can flip on a switch and be like oh well I'm ready to make friends now it's
3489620	3495140	not that simple and until our society understands this there's going to be a fundamental disconnect
3495140	3502980	in how we treat introverted people and the idea the idea that you have to be socially well-rounded
3503540	3511940	to succeed in adult society is complete BS yeah I'm sure you have to be really socially outgoing
3511940	3517300	to sit at a computer in a cubicle for 11 hours a day there's no actual requirement that you have
3517300	3526180	to be socially outgoing in order to have a stable career and life in society but for some reason
3526180	3533460	the powers that be have made it an expectation for people where oh you have to have people skills if
3533460	3542660	you want to succeed I don't buy into it at all maybe in the 1950s but not now when 90 percent of
3542660	3548100	all work in the world goes through the internet where you don't actually have to directly
3548100	3554580	communicate between people I don't buy for one second that you gotta be socially outgoing to
3554580	3560420	succeed it just doesn't make sense and it's ridiculous especially now that we have the
3560420	3566820	internet and online schooling to continue forcing these introverted people to be miserable and
3566820	3570980	that's the real problem and that's the real discussion we need to be having as to why these
3570980	3576980	school shootings are happening but uh no one's going to talk about that because gun gun gun
3576980	3587220	assault rifle gun nra gun gun gun gun gun ah what a beautiful day I wonder what's going on with
3587220	3595300	youtube oh well time to make another video complaining about youtube okay I just want to
3595300	3602340	point out that it's really ironic and hilarious that I'm making a rant about youtube and in in
3602340	3610020	like 10 minutes I'm having a consultation with a youtube partner manager you're literally watching
3610020	3616900	the destruction of my youtube career they will never ever let me get any views after this
3616900	3627540	hi everyone back at you again with the basketball so I got off the old youtube conference call with
3627540	3635940	my very own partner manager I should probably explain the context leading up to this encounter
3636740	3644340	I think about three weeks ago I got emailed by a person from youtube saying they want to contact me
3644340	3654100	now I've been a youtube partner for almost four years now but this was my first real interaction
3654660	3663140	with an actual human that works at youtube I know it's amazing I always used to view youtube as this
3663940	3671860	monolithic faceless corporation and even though my opinion of youtube hasn't really changed
3671860	3680260	after this interaction I do feel like I'm in a different place I'm working my way up the ranks
3680260	3688980	guys so how did the call go um it was a little odd I can't say it went differently than I expected
3689700	3695940	but still though the just the novelty of talking to an actual human who works at youtube
3696820	3702020	it's something I've never really experienced before there was one point in the conversation
3702020	3712900	when I hinted at my videos being blacklisted and not showing up in people's recommendations
3713460	3720900	I'm 80 sure that this person I was talking to was aware of all the of all the videos I did
3720900	3726740	complaining about youtube that was kind of the elephant in the room during the whole
3726740	3733060	conversation and we never really discussed it because this person I talked to they were aware of
3733060	3740260	minute memes they were aware of youtube geographic it was clear to me that they at the very least
3740260	3748100	skimmed my content so I wouldn't be surprised if they didn't also know about the youtube complaint
3748100	3755060	stuff so we talked for about 20 minutes you know there's a lot of introductory stuff just asking
3755060	3760100	me about sort of the direction of my channel so we didn't get a didn't really get to talk about
3760100	3768900	anything that in depth um however we did schedule a meeting for uh for june one day in june gonna
3768900	3774740	have a meeting and we're gonna go a lot more in depth in into the discussion so we'll just have
3774740	3780260	to see what happens there but after this encounter I did have a change of heart with the uh
3780820	3788340	with the next youtube rant and after talking to this person at youtube I just don't think I can
3788340	3796420	go through with uploading this rant as its own video and that's not because I got brainwashed
3796420	3803220	by the cult of youtube no I still feel as strongly about that issue as I did before the meeting the
3803220	3810260	reason I don't want to publicize my distaste for youtube policies is that I know now for sure that
3810260	3815460	I'm being scrutinized and I'm fairly certain that all those complaining videos I did back in
3815460	3822740	december and january really uh it really rubbed old youtube the wrong way and it was only after
3822740	3827860	I stopped that kind of stuff that my channel could finally go back to normal and they actually
3827860	3832340	reached out and made contact with me it was like what do I have to gain by making this video
3832340	3837300	everyone's already complaining about it and even though I feel like my criticism is still valid
3837300	3840900	I just don't feel like there's much to be gained from this I feel like I have a really big
3840900	3848420	opportunity here to really work my way up into the inside of youtube to really see the truth of
3848420	3854980	how youtube works and I don't want to jeopardize that opportunity just yet I don't know it feels
3854980	3861860	like kind of a cop out doesn't it I mean for the past two years I've been so high and mighty about
3862500	3869460	speaking my mind at whatever cost but I don't know I just feel different now youtube
3869460	3877780	is a huge machine and if you're not careful they will destroy you and as much as I like
3878420	3884420	standing up for people that youtube fucks over on this website there comes a point where I just
3884420	3890900	end up fucking myself so after thinking about it I decided I'm not gonna upload that rant
3891460	3896820	as its own video but at the same time I kind of don't want it to go to waste so I'll probably
3896820	3903060	just stick it at the end of this vlog you know I really didn't want to make another video where I
3903060	3910420	whine and bitch and moan and complain about youtube I didn't want to be that guy I've been
3910420	3916500	holding off on the complaints for about four months now but just this week youtube announced
3916500	3922740	something so insanely idiotic that I have to talk about it so last summer I uploaded a video
3922740	3928900	called youtube has been on a downward spiral where I basically run down point by point
3928900	3934180	everything wrong with youtube today and in that video I talked about how youtube has gradually
3934180	3941300	taken steps to take power away from the individual and emphasize content that they want you to see
3941300	3945940	so remember when people on youtube actually had to go out and explore the content they wanted
3945940	3951700	to watch well not anymore now you can just sit back and relax while the algorithm delivers you
3951700	3958020	all the content you should be watching no user input required just click on your home page and
3958020	3963380	youtube will recommend you all the videos that they know you like watching oh what's that you
3963380	3968100	want to watch your subscriptions you know the channels that you already like for sure to the
3968100	3973380	extent that you want to be notified of their future uploads well fuck you you don't know what
3973380	3979060	you like but the algorithm does so we're setting your home page to default fuck subscriptions
3979780	3985220	well everyone I'm proud to announce that we have reached the end game we have reached the climax
3985220	3991780	of Susan W's master plan because youtube has announced that they are experimenting with the
3991780	3998740	subscription function the most fundamental basic function that has been a part of this website
3998740	4004580	since day one imagine if facebook started experimenting with the friends function
4004580	4010660	or if reddit started experimenting with the karma function well that's what youtube is doing with
4010660	4016180	subscriptions and of course we all know what they mean by experimenting they're gonna say it's
4016180	4021860	optional for a couple of months and then quietly make it mandatory just like they do with every
4021860	4027540	change they make so I'm gonna interpret this as a change that has already been made and a decision
4027540	4033700	that's already set in stone this is happening it's always been happening and they've just now gone
4033700	4038500	public with it because they're gonna release it on everyone in a few months and we all know what
4038500	4044180	they're gonna do they're gonna use the subscription feed as yet another vehicle to control the content
4044180	4049220	you see they already did it with the home page they already did it with the trending tab they
4049220	4055140	already did it with the notification bell the subscription feed was the last bastion that was
4055140	4060740	supposedly out of youtube's control and I don't even think that's been true for the past two years
4060740	4066420	do you have any idea how many people have messaged me saying that my videos did not appear in their
4066420	4071460	subscriptions and I don't think it's a coincidence that most of these claims happened after a stretch
4071460	4077540	where I made several videos criticizing youtube so based on that evidence I think youtube has been
4077540	4082740	testing out this system for a long time already and they'll tell you the lie that they say for
4082740	4088020	every other change they make where they take away personal choice they'll say that they're only
4088020	4094020	showing you the content you want to see and that content of course is not governed by your own
4094020	4101460	agency but by a machine learning AI that estimates the videos you may or may not be interested in
4101460	4107940	and then we get to the real truth of why youtube makes changes like this and let me tell you it's
4107940	4114260	sure as hell not to give you the videos you want to see but rather it's to hide the videos that
4114260	4119380	they don't want you to see once again they already do this with the home page trending
4119380	4125620	recommendations and notifications research has demonstrated that youtube shadow bans mature
4125620	4130900	and questionable content from these locations and I'm pretty sure they'll restrict and censor this
4130900	4136420	video criticizing them just like they did with my Logan Paul video so be on the lookout for that I
4136420	4142900	guess youtube has sunk their claws into almost everything on the whole website and subscriptions
4142900	4149140	were the last thing they didn't fully control the last nugget of individual choice that a youtube
4149140	4154180	viewer has over the content they want to see subscribe to a user and you'll see their new
4154180	4161620	uploads it's as simple as that it's been here since 2005 and yet youtube has become so power
4161700	4167780	hungry that they want to wrestle that away from the people too and guess what they already have
4167780	4174180	behind our backs as usual this change is going to happen mark my words youtube never back tracks on
4174180	4180340	any new feature no matter how unpopular it is and they always try to back it up saying oh well the
4180340	4187300	analytics show that trust us we're so smart we're from silicon valley and we're smarter than you
4187300	4192180	and the numbers say this is a good idea and that's all anyone cares about on this website
4192180	4198740	anymore numbers numbers numbers why do you think there are 10 000 grown ass adults on this website
4198740	4205220	who play with toys for a living oh just look at the numbers why do you think Logan Paul felt it
4205220	4211620	was necessary to film a dead body and put it on youtube well have you seen the numbers that got
4211620	4216340	him and after removing the functionality of subscriptions guess what will happen to
4216340	4224420	subscribers on youtube that's right they'll be demoted to just a number hey youtube not everything
4224420	4231620	can be measured in numbers and stats and analytics and if you let them govern you they will destroy
4231620	4237780	you can you guys put a number on how you have managed to become the single most hated social
4237780	4243780	media site on the entire web even worse than facebook there's a site that started chasing
4243780	4248900	numbers and three years later mark zuckerberg is seen as a literal reptile and they have to
4248900	4254740	spam sappy apology ads on national television there's something to be said about short term
4254740	4261220	versus long term growth sure i could film a video of myself drinking a beaker full of sulfuric acid
4261220	4266340	and that video would probably have great numbers in the short term but what about the long term
4266340	4272260	youtube what about the long term i'm not going to be getting many more views after being dead
4272260	4277540	so go ahead youtube keep letting numbers run this website there's no way you could possibly
4277540	4285380	end up like facebook or skype or dig or myspace keep treating your users like brain dead toddlers
4285380	4290820	who can't decide on their own what videos they want to watch you know what they probably make
4290820	4296340	up most of your viewers anyway these days you chased away all of your older dedicated viewers
4296340	4303220	by alienating them time and time again when you take subscriptions away from the subscribers
4303220	4312100	you take the you out of youtube now it's just a two
