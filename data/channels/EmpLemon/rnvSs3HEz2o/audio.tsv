0	4500	In the first episode of Never Ever, I talked about the appeal of SpongeBob.
4500	10500	I like SpongeBob, and it's not difficult to explain why I like SpongeBob, because everybody likes SpongeBob.
10500	13500	Professional wrestling is a bit of a different story.
13500	19500	When I say names like Ric Flair, Randy Savage, Hulk Hogan, and Andre the Giant,
19500	26500	most of you can probably picture a vague figure in your heads, but you can't specifically tell who I'm talking about.
26500	27500	Why is this?
27500	34000	Well, the answer is, professional wrestling is one of the most popular and unpopular forms of entertainment on Earth.
34000	42000	Trying to justify to people why I enjoy watching professional wrestling is like trying to justify why manatees haven't gone extinct.
42000	48500	On the surface, it just looks so dumb and awkward, and makes you wonder how something like it could even exist,
48500	52000	and more importantly, how it continues to exist.
52000	57500	Now, I'll admit, the idea of watching half-naked, oily buff dudes pretending to beat each other up
57500	63000	doesn't exactly sound like the most entertaining thing in the world, but that's kind of what makes it so amazing.
63000	70500	Because despite its weird premise and clumsy appearance, professional wrestling fosters the capacity for emotional storytelling
70500	76500	that can compel an arena of stoic adults to jump out of their seats and scream like little kids.
82000	89000	Don't believe me? Well, then you probably haven't watched an episode of Monday Night Raw.
112000	126500	But AMP, a lot of you are probably thinking, professional wrestling isn't real.
126500	134000	You must be too dumb to realize that. I am smarter than you because I know that professional wrestling is fake.
134000	140500	Aw man, you got me. Professional wrestling is not, in fact, a real athletic competition.
140500	146500	There's no getting around that. Guess I have to end the video here because pro wrestling isn't real.
152500	159500	But neither is Star Wars, or the Avengers, or Goku, or Homer Simpson, or any character in Super Smash Bros.
159500	167000	None of these things are real. However, it doesn't stop people from talking about them far more than they do a lot of real things.
167000	175000	And in order to truly appreciate the rhetorical value of pro wrestling, you must treat it as it really is, a work of fiction.
175000	181000	But not just any fiction, pro wrestling is one of the last remaining bastions of theater.
181000	188000	Now, like a lot of you, I went to public school, where many of you can probably remember multiple times in English class
188000	195500	when you had to learn about this guy called Bill Shakespeare, considered by many scholars to be the greatest playwright of all time.
195500	199500	And for so many years, I didn't get the appeal. I don't think anyone else did either.
199500	207500	The only types of people in school who actually seemed to care about Shakespeare were the future MIT grad who memorized every piece of trivia ever,
207500	210500	or the kid who was way too into theater.
210500	218500	I never realized the value of Shakespeare until I discovered the treasure trove of old pro wrestling clips on YouTube.
226500	227500	Okay, this is epic.
227500	231500	And only then did I realize why people love Shakespeare.
231500	238500	Reading Shakespeare in seventh grade English is so boring because the content is not meant to be consumed through words on paper.
238500	244500	Shakespearean plays flourished during a time before the majority of people knew how to read.
244500	250500	Playwrights and actors had to craft compelling narrative performances using the limited tools they had.
250500	260500	If you boil it down, the genre of theater mostly involves a bunch of weird people in stupid costumes prancing around and over embellishing in iambic pentameter.
260500	264500	Theatrical entertainment doesn't come from what's literally happening on stage.
264500	269500	The value of theater comes from filling in the blanks using our imagination.
269500	274500	This fundamental principle is otherwise known as the suspension of disbelief.
274500	282500	It's why when you see this image, your brain doesn't automatically interpret it as some guy called Mark Hamill holding a blue stick.
282500	287500	When you see this image, you see Luke Skywalker holding a lightsaber.
287500	289500	Neither of which are actually real.
289500	294500	Suspension of disbelief allows us to accept beyond what's literally happening on screen.
294500	301500	It allows us to experience a story and its characters as real, no matter how simple the presentation.
301500	309500	This same principle applies to novels, comic books, musical lyrics, cartoons, movies, and yes, professional wrestling.
309500	313500	Visual storytelling is an inherently human art form.
313500	318500	And people have been performing stories for audiences for thousands of years,
318500	322500	dating all the way back to the earliest known auditoriums of ancient Greece,
322500	328500	where citizens would gather around and listen to an esteemed orator recite the works of Homer.
329500	332500	I'm so angry I could spit flames out of my butt!
332500	336500	Homer Simpson vs. Lisa Simpson
340500	346500	It should go without saying that the 1990s in America were very different from 6th century BC Greece.
346500	355500	3,000 years ago, people really didn't have that much stuff to drown out the entertainment value of a guy standing on a platform and just talking to the audience.
355500	359500	The 1990s was the birth of a new era of screens.
359500	365500	Television, video games, huge blockbuster movies, even the beginning of the World Wide Web.
365500	372500	The new millennium was rapidly approaching, and everyone was preparing for the futuristic technocratic utopian future of the 2000s
372500	377500	by surrounding themselves with the newest, coolest gadgets of the age.
377500	382500	You'd expect that all these new entertainment sources wouldn't leave much room for a little old theater.
382500	386500	And you'd probably be right if it weren't for professional wrestling.
386500	395500	From about 1996 to 2001, professional wrestling became one of the most inescapable cornerstones of American entertainment.
395500	401500	And in order to understand why, we must first talk about a guy by the name of Vince McMahon.
408500	410500	Vince McMahon started out with nothing.
410500	414500	He was trapped in a dirt-poor household with an abusive stepfather.
414500	420500	Today he's worth about $3.5 billion, which is a little bit more than Donald Trump.
420500	424500	It should be noted that this disparity hasn't prevented the two from being friends,
424500	430500	which is the primary reason why Vince's wife Linda is currently in the Executive Cabinet of the United States.
430500	434500	Perhaps Vince and Donald are such good friends because they have so much in common.
434500	437500	The two billionaires were born just ten months apart.
437500	442500	Both got rich not through a groundbreaking invention, but through ruthless business acumen.
442500	446500	Both of them started a rival football league to the NFL that ultimately failed,
446500	452500	and both of them built empires by transforming businesses that they inherited from their fathers.
452500	459500	In Vince McMahon's case, he reunited with his father, Vince McMahon, Sr., at the age of 12.
459500	465500	Vince Sr. owned the World Wide Wrestling Federation, and Vince took a managerial position at the company.
465500	472500	Perhaps the most phenomenal athlete of all time, standing to my right, the one and only Andre the Giant heads up one on one.
472500	480500	By the mid-1980s, Vince Sr. had passed away and Vince McMahon was now in charge of a booming wrestling empire.
485500	490500	Over the past decade, McMahon had completely overhauled the territorial system of the pro wrestling industry
490500	495500	and transformed the WWF into a nationally recognized brand.
495500	500500	In the 80s, the WWF experienced their first great boom period.
500500	507500	Vince's ambitious business ventures like WrestleMania brought professional wrestling into the American pay-per-view market
507500	512500	and transformed stars like Hulk Hogan into national icons.
512500	517500	The WWF's huge success in the late 80s quickly began to recede in the early 90s, however.
518500	524500	This was due to a multitude of reasons, ranging from a waning audience, Hulk Hogan departing for Hollywood,
524500	528500	and a massive steroid controversy that almost sent Vince to prison.
528500	533500	Coupled with other failed experiments such as the World Bodybuilding Federation,
533500	538500	it's safe to say that by 1993, Vince was in dire need of a new enterprise.
538500	545500	It was at this time when Vince decided to transition the WWF into a staple of cable television
545500	548500	through the debut of Monday Night Raw.
561500	565500	Ever since the popularization of the television in American society,
565500	568500	professional wrestling has always had its place on TV,
568500	572500	but never to the extent of what Monday Night Raw sought to accomplish.
572500	579500	Prior to Raw, the primary role of wrestling on TV was to stimulate interest for live shows or pay-per-views.
579500	586500	Wrestling programming at this time was supplemental, and mostly involved recapping old events or promoting new ones.
586500	591500	You would hardly ever see any high-profile or interesting wrestling matches televised during this time,
591500	594500	as the intrigue was reserved for more important events.
594500	601500	Monday Night Raw changed all of that by broadcasting new matches and progressing the story every Monday night on the USA Network.
601500	605500	Before Raw, pro wrestling was limited in its storytelling capabilities,
605500	612500	as most of the time the audience would only be aware of the narrative and characters through a handful of pay-per-view events each year.
612500	616500	Raw greatly expanded the capacity for storytelling in the WWF,
616500	620500	as the audience could now tune into new developments on a weekly basis.
620500	626500	The foundation had been set for one of the most innovative and unique television programs in the world,
626500	631500	but it would take an entirely separate force to truly take Raw to the next level.
635500	642500	Today, the WWF is now the WWE, and it's the only major wrestling promotion in America.
642500	645500	In the 90s, however, there was another.
645500	650500	WCW was a wrestling promotion largely based in the South,
650500	656500	and by the 1990s, it was the only major wrestling promotion in America that Vince had failed to conquer.
656500	661500	The company was largely helped by the endorsement of media mogul Ted Turner,
661500	667500	a longtime wrestling fan who supported WCW by airing its programming on the Turner family of networks.
667500	673500	In the early 90s, WCW quickly became a popular alternative to the WWF,
673500	678500	due in large part to signing some of the WWF's older and more established talent.
678500	683500	In 1995, a Turner Network executive by the name of Eric Bischoff
683500	689500	decided the time was right to challenge the WWF's throne as the number one wrestling company in America.
689500	695500	On September 4th, 1995, WCW would launch Monday Nitro,
695500	699500	their own weekly block of wrestling entertainment on TNT.
699500	705500	Nitro would go on to compete head-to-head with Raw, occupying the same prime-time time slot.
705500	711500	And starting in 1996, Nitro would overtake Raw in television viewership,
711500	716500	beginning an 84-week-long streak of WCW dominance.
716500	720500	In the midst of Nitro's prolonged period of success over Raw,
720500	723500	Vince McMahon knew that his company was now in jeopardy.
723500	728500	More and more of the WWF's high-end talent were jumping ship to WCW,
728500	733500	leaving Raw stuck with a cast of unpopular and unproven faces.
733500	736500	So when faced with such stiff competition,
736500	739500	Vince did what any other monarch would do when his empires threatened.
739500	741500	Go to war.
764500	769500	You don't see knives, you don't see guns, you don't see rapes,
769500	773500	you don't see anything at all like that that's portrayed in anything that we do.
773500	777500	It's a very wholesome, family-oriented environment.
777500	783500	WWF wrestling in the 80s and early 90s was largely a reflection of American culture at the time.
783500	788500	It had a deceptively sanitized exterior of traditional family values
788500	793500	that was masking a grotesque underbelly of steroids, cocaine, and painkillers.
793500	796500	You had the bleached blonde hero Hulk Hogan
796500	800500	patriotically leg-dropping America's nefarious foreign adversaries.
800500	804500	By the mid-90s, a lot of people in America began to see through the facade,
804500	808500	which gave rise to a huge movement of counterculture.
813500	816500	All of a sudden, you had the American hero Hulk Hogan
816500	821500	dying his beard black, smoking cigars, and beating up good guys on WCW,
821500	823500	and people loved it.
823500	826500	Vince could see the tide of American culture turning,
826500	830500	and he knew that if he wanted to save his empire, he was going to have to get edgy.
830500	836500	What transpired was one of the most awe-inspiring two years in the history of American television,
836500	844500	with Monday Night Raw and WCW Nitro constantly trying to outdo each other for a share of the American TV audience.
845500	853500	Steve is a dead man walking, because when Austin 3-16 meets Pillman, 9 millimeter o'clock!
856500	861500	Imagine if Seinfeld and Friends were both trying to put each other out of business
861500	866500	as members of each cast would constantly swap back and forth between each show.
866500	870500	This is what it must have been like to watch professional wrestling during this era.
870500	874500	I could list off a compilation of all the outrageous and incredible events
874500	878500	that were transpiring between these companies on a weekly basis,
878500	882500	but to truly help you grasp the absolute madness of this time,
882500	887500	I only need to show you one moment from one episode of Monday Night Raw.
887500	893500	But before you can truly know the significance of this moment, I've got some explaining to do.
893500	897500	First and foremost, every good story needs a good protagonist,
897500	900500	so let's talk about Mick Foley.
905500	912500	When you picture a professional wrestler in your head, you probably don't picture a guy like Mick Foley.
912500	920500	Mick Foley's pear-shaped physique hardly resembles the tall, chiseled muscle men that are common in the WWF.
920500	927500	Mick Foley doesn't have the freakish size, herculean strength, or Olympic athleticism to draw an audience.
927500	932500	The reason wrestling fans watch Mick Foley is to watch him get hurt.
932500	939500	By all measures, Mick Foley is simply not talented enough to earn a share of the pro wrestling spotlight.
939500	947500	To compensate for this, he sacrifices his own body through some of the most death-defying stunts the WWF has ever seen.
947500	954500	Perhaps Mick Foley's most iconic moment came in 1998 during the second ever Hell in a Cell match.
954500	961500	In this match, Mick Foley is wrestling as Mankind, just one of his three different wrestling personas.
961500	968500	Mankind is supposed to be this disfigured, gremlin-like guy who lives in the boiler room beneath the arena.
968500	974500	He finishes off his opponents by suffocating them with a dirty sock, and he's completely insane.
974500	978500	In this match, Mankind is fighting The Undertaker.
983500	988500	The Undertaker is one of the most legendary and recognizable wrestlers of all time.
988500	997500	It's difficult to get wrestling fans to agree on anything, but even the most jaded ones will act giddy upon hearing the sound of The Undertaker's iconic dong.
997500	1011500	The popularity of The Undertaker is difficult to describe for anyone who's not a fan of professional wrestling, and I'm not going to try to explain it now.
1011500	1018500	But maybe Justin Wang from the YouTube channel Wang can, since, you know, he kind of looks like The Undertaker.
1018500	1024500	The Undertaker is hands down the greatest character in the history of WWE.
1024500	1030500	He debuts at a time when Vince is going crazy throwing all kinds of different gimmicks against the wall.
1030500	1035500	Literally shares his first PPV appearance with a guy in a giant turkey costume.
1035500	1042500	But unlike The Garbage Man who for some reason also wrestles, or The Plumber who for some reason also wrestles,
1042500	1047500	The Undead Zombie who for some reason also wrestles had way more staying power.
1047500	1053500	The Undertaker very quickly becomes a fan favorite and maintains that status for almost 30 years.
1053500	1061500	He continually reinvents himself over the course of those 30 years and eventually becomes the unbeatable final boss of WrestleMania, except for that time he got beaten.
1061500	1069500	But it's actually kind of a good thing that he got beaten because to pigeonhole him as the WrestleMania guy minimizes everything else that he's accomplished in his career.
1069500	1077500	Thanks Justin. I'm not going to get too much into The Undertaker right now because he doesn't really play a role in the Raw moment I'm discussing.
1077500	1087500	But he was involved in Mick Foley's most recognizable moment ever by throwing mankind off the top of the cell in front of thousands of stunned spectators.
1093500	1101500	Mick Foley's 280 pound body plummeted from the height of a two-story building and splashed down on the announcer table below.
1101500	1104500	No one had ever seen anything like it.
1104500	1111500	The following shots of Mick Foley show medical personnel surrounding him and lifting his limp body onto a stretcher.
1111500	1119500	At this point any fan watching would have walked away completely satisfied with the effort that Mick had already put into this one stunt.
1119500	1121500	About five minutes later this happened.
1135500	1139500	Good God! Good God! That's it, he's dead!
1142500	1150500	Shortly after this Mick Foley can be seen somehow still conscious sitting up in the ring corner with his tooth in his nostril.
1150500	1153500	He then wrestled The Undertaker for about 10 more minutes.
1155500	1159500	Where he eventually got choke slammed onto a pile of thumbtacks.
1165500	1174500	The Undertaker won this match but Mick Foley through his superhuman resilience to pain had won the hearts of the WWF fans.
1174500	1182500	Naturally this match instantly cemented Mick Foley as a legend in the pro wrestling universe and as a fan favorite.
1182500	1189500	And even though he won the admiration of the audience he never quite seemed like a guy who was supposed to win a lot of matches.
1189500	1197500	And most importantly never did anyone truly believe that Mick Foley could become the WWF Champion.
1202500	1209500	So what's the point of watching big strong dudes throw each other off the tops of buildings?
1209500	1218500	Well the goal of both fictional wrestling and legitimate athletic competitions is to find out who is the best in the world.
1218500	1223500	So you have a bunch of wrestlers fight each other and some of them win more than others.
1223500	1230500	And only then do the winningest wrestlers have an opportunity to fight for the WWF Championship.
1230500	1234500	Becoming the champion is not just the ultimate goal for the characters in the storyline.
1234500	1240500	It is also the ultimate sign of validation for a wrestler's real life career.
1240500	1246500	The fundamental foundation of every wrestling narrative is watching guys fight to become the champion.
1246500	1250500	Lower tiers of wrestlers will each fight for their own version of a championship.
1250500	1257500	But no title is more coveted and more prestigious than the WWF Heavyweight Championship.
1257500	1264500	Historically the WWF Title has been reserved for only the biggest most popular attraction in the company.
1264500	1270500	When you become the WWF Champion you become the face of the company.
1270500	1275500	Usually the championship only changes hands once maybe twice a year.
1275500	1278500	So whenever it happens it's a pretty big deal.
1278500	1287500	And on the January 4th 1999 episode of Raw, Mankind found himself with an opportunity to win the WWF Championship.
1287500	1290500	This is the essence of his hero's journey.
1290500	1292500	But every hero needs a good villain.
1292500	1298500	And the villain of this story just so happens to be the guy Mick Foley is facing for the championship.
1298500	1301500	A man who many of you already know.
1301500	1303500	Do you smell what The Rock is cooking?
1310500	1315500	Today The Rock is one of the most recognized Hollywood actors on the planet.
1315500	1319500	Although many people would agree that he makes a much better celebrity than an actor.
1319500	1327500	Most of The Rock's repertoire today involves acting in high profile but ultimately forgettable action flicks and Moana.
1327500	1332500	The Rock's widespread fame today may raise the question of how he got popular in the first place.
1332500	1339500	You see 20 years ago The Rock burst onto the pop culture scene as a wrestling god.
1339500	1346500	To this day no one wrestler has ever been able to hold the audience in the palm of his hand quite like The Rock could.
1346500	1348500	But it wasn't always like that.
1348500	1353500	In fact when The Rock first debuted in the WWF he was hated.
1353500	1361500	The Rock didn't start off as the wise-crackin', smack-talkin', one-liner-droppin' legend that many of you know him as today.
1361500	1369500	He was a bland, dopey-looking Samoan called Rocky Maivia who would stand in the middle of the ring and smile like a goober.
1369500	1376500	This was a character that may have worked 10 years prior but not during the era of edgy 90s counterculture.
1376500	1384500	WWF fans hated Rocky with a passion and they would shower him with relentless booze while chanting Die Rocky Die.
1384500	1391500	Eventually it became clear that the only way for Rocky Maivia to stop getting pushed around by the crowd was to push back.
1391500	1395500	And on one fateful day The Rock was bored.
1395500	1400500	I got three words. Die Rocky Die.
1400500	1404500	That's the gratitude I get from you pieces of crap.
1404500	1410500	Over the next two years The Rock would transform into one of the most smarmy villains in the company,
1410500	1416500	becoming such a good heel that ironically the audience had no choice but to love him.
1416500	1423500	In 1998 The Rock would align himself with Vince McMahon and the corporation to cheat to win the WWF Championship,
1423500	1426500	commencing his new reign as the Corporate Champion.
1426500	1431500	In order to become the Champion, mankind would have to go through not just The Rock,
1431500	1435500	but the squad of goons in Vince McMahon's corporate stable.
1435500	1440500	The deck seemed stacked against him. At least it was until he got a little help from Triple H.
1445500	1449500	Triple H may be one of the most interesting wrestlers of all time,
1449500	1453500	not for what he's done inside of the ring, but for what he's done outside of it.
1453500	1458500	Triple H started off as just another no-name wrestler in the mid-90s.
1458500	1462500	He is now one of the top executives in the WWE.
1462500	1468500	His real-life rise to power within the company is most likely due to his marriage with Stephanie McMahon,
1468500	1471500	Vince McMahon's daughter, and heir to the WWE throne.
1471500	1479500	I would go more into Triple H, but this video by screenwriter Max Landis explains his career better than I ever could.
1479500	1485500	All you need to know for our story is that Triple H is the leader of a faction called D-Generation X.
1491500	1498500	If you happen to be working at the Standards and Practices Department for the USA Network from 1997 to 2000,
1498500	1504500	the mere mention of the letters DX will probably give you a PTSD flashback.
1504500	1509500	Seemingly every week, DX would invent new ways to joke about their penises.
1509500	1514500	They spent every moment on screen basically acting as raunchy as possible.
1514500	1518500	They also popularized the crotch chop ten years before Waluigi did it.
1518500	1526500	One time, the members of DX rode a literal tank to the front door of WCW Nitro just to stick it to their competition.
1526500	1532500	But if there's one thing Triple H and DX hated more than WCW, it's authority.
1532500	1533500	Hey, wait a minute.
1533500	1538500	Anyway, whenever McMahon's ruthless corporation would attack a defenseless wrestler,
1538500	1542500	DX would seemingly always be there to level the playing field.
1542500	1547500	And that's exactly what happened in Mankind's championship match versus The Rock.
1547500	1552500	We enter a scene of utter chaos as the audience anxiously waits on pins and needles
1552500	1558500	anticipating if Mankind can do the unthinkable and win the WWF title.
1558500	1560500	And that's when they hear the all too familiar sound.
1562500	1569500	At this moment, the roof of the arena is about to become unhinged from the surprise return of Stone Cold Steve Austin.
1577500	1584500	Stone Cold Steve Austin may be the most popular wrestler of all time, even more so than Hulk Hogan.
1584500	1589500	But he, like many other wrestlers I've talked about here, came from humble beginnings.
1589500	1595500	Stunning Steve Austin was just an average and forgettable wrestler for WCW in the mid 90s.
1595500	1602500	In 1995, WCW unceremoniously fired Austin while he was out of action with an injury.
1602500	1608500	But if things couldn't get bad enough for Steve, this was also the time when he went completely bald.
1608500	1612500	And when a man has lost his hair, he has nothing left to lose.
1612500	1616500	Steve Austin would join the WWF with a vengeance.
1616500	1622500	He cultivated the anger from his WCW firing and adopted it into a Stone Cold new persona.
1622500	1628500	Stone Cold Steve Austin became a pissed off redneck from Texas who would beat up everyone and everything.
1628500	1635500	He was the consummate anti-hero, constantly interrupting matches to beat people up for literally no reason.
1635500	1643500	These antics made him popular for sure, but he would only attain legendary stardom through his feud with Vince McMahon.
1647500	1655500	Those of you unfamiliar with wrestling may have been confused earlier in this video when I mentioned that The Rock teamed up with Vince McMahon.
1655500	1662500	Why is the owner of the WWF recruiting a stable of bad guys to beat up other wrestlers in his company?
1662500	1669500	Well, unlike most billionaire CEOs, Vince McMahon is deeply passionate about the product he's selling.
1669500	1676500	And he is willing to put his own ass in the ring and get beat up by his own employees as long as it's good for business.
1676500	1691500	Even past the ripe old age of 70, Vince is still occasionally willing to step in the ring and take a top rope frog splash from a 266 pound fat guy back in the 90s when the WWF was in serious danger of going under.
1691500	1696500	Vince took it upon himself to do whatever was necessary to save his company.
1696500	1705500	Going so far as to abandon his casual role as a commentator and quickly transform himself into the most despicable villain in all of wrestling.
1726500	1733500	So that means that every single day that you see me, that's on the worst day of my life.
1734500	1739500	The 90s ushered in a period of sterile corporatization for the American worker.
1739500	1746500	This was a time when most Americans had fallen out of faith with the government, but still somewhat trusted their corporate overlords.
1746500	1753500	A time before companies like Enron and the big banks royally screwed up and put the world economy on a downward spiral.
1753500	1759500	A time before the internet transformed the paradigm of what was thought possible for earning a paycheck.
1759500	1763500	Most Americans entering the workforce at this time were left with one of one option.
1763500	1770500	You would spend all your daylight hours, Monday through Friday, working in a cubicle under oppressive fluorescent lighting.
1770500	1774500	And you were expected to do this week in and week out for 40 years.
1774500	1778500	Naturally, a lot of workers weren't exactly thrilled with this reality.
1778500	1787500	Vince McMahon must have known this because starting in 1998, he transformed himself into the living embodiment of everything Americans hated about their corporate world.
1787500	1798500	And for every ounce of hatred projected on Vince, Americans found an equal amount of catharsis in watching stone cold Steve Austin repeatedly beat the piss out of him on national TV.
1798500	1805500	The Austin McMahon feud escalated throughout the entire year and it catapulted Austin into mainstream stardom.
1805500	1816500	Steve Austin did on a weekly basis what every layperson in America wishes they could have done to their bosses, teachers, or any other oppressive authority figure that separated them from what they wanted.
1816500	1822500	He represents something universal about the human spirit. The desire to fight back against those who control you.
1822500	1826500	The constant dream of capturing your own slice of agency.
1826500	1838500	Stone Cold Steve Austin is a man who cannot be controlled because the second you try, he'll blow up your bus, fill your car with cement, and spray you with beer from a fire hose.
1838500	1841500	And most importantly, he'll give the people what they want.
1856500	1864500	Stone Cold is here! Look out! Oh, Stone Cold with a chance! He put Stone Cold on the wall! No! No!
1864500	1872500	Many wrestling historians like to point to this moment as the loudest crowd reaction in WWE history.
1872500	1877500	I guess ultimately that's the whole point of all of this. To give people a window into a different world.
1877500	1880500	A world where you could truly believe the unbelievable.
1880500	1884500	A world where valiant heroes could overcome seemingly impossible odds.
1884500	1888500	And where despicable villains would always be brought to justice.
1888500	1891500	Eventually. You just had to keep watching to see it happen.
1891500	1896500	And many Americans did, even if it was just for two hours a week on a Monday night.
1896500	1906500	Wrestling historians also like to point to this event as the moment where WWF surpassed WCW once and for all as the premier wrestling company in America.
1906500	1913500	Over on TNT, the Nitro commentators intentionally spoiled the ending of that night's Raw ahead of time.
1913500	1918500	If you're even thinking about changing the channel to our competition, fans do not.
1918500	1927500	Because we understand that Mick Foley, who present here on time as Cactus Jack, is going to win their world title.
1927500	1938500	This decision backfired spectacularly as 600,000 Nitro viewers immediately changed the channel to Raw to witness one of the greatest moments in professional wrestling history.
1938500	1946500	Conversely, those who kept watching Nitro that night got to witness one of the most anticlimactic and frustrating moments in wrestling history.
1946500	1955500	As the despicable villain Hollywood Hogan reclaimed the WCW Championship after his so-called opponent Kevin Nash literally laid down and gave it to him.
1955500	1958500	Two years later, WCW would go out of business.
1958500	1967500	And Vince would finally achieve his goal of conquering the last major American wrestling promotion by acquiring WCW for pennies on the dollar.
1967500	1971500	Right after the WCW commentators spoiled the end of Raw that night,
1971500	1977500	Tony Schiavone infamously mocked the idea of Mankind winning the WWF title by sarcastically commenting,
1978500	1991500	Technically, he was correct in his snide assessment because no one was sitting down in the Centrum Center as the referee counted to three on Mankind's first ever championship victory.
1991500	1999500	Monday Night Raw is still on the air today. WWE and wrestling as a whole have largely diminished in popularity since this time.
1999500	2004500	It's a decline brought about not from what's different in the ring, but rather how the world has changed around it.
2004500	2012500	And for this reason, WWE may never again be able to replicate a moment of this spectacle, but nothing else on TV really could either.
2012500	2017500	The pure hype of the crowd surrounding the ring that night is something truly unique about professional wrestling.
2017500	2026500	There's a visceral, palpitating feeling of unbridled excitement that permeates through whatever screen you're watching it on, even 20 years later.
2026500	2031500	The cascading wave of emotion on display here is, quite simply, Raw.
2031500	2038500	And you'd be hard-pressed to replicate something like this with any other TV show. Not bad for something that's not even real.
2038500	2045500	This is the end of just another episode of Monday Night Raw. There are more than 1300 other episodes like it and counting.
2045500	2056500	So if you find yourself bored on a Monday night flipping through channels on TV, and you happen to catch a glimpse of a bunch of weird-looking musclemen brawling on the USA Network, you can stop and appreciate it.
2056500	2060500	Because there will never ever be another TV show like it.
2061500	2083500	Oh my God, no! Mankind did it! Nick Foley did it! No, Stone Cold did it! Mankind has achieved this dream in the dream of everyone else who's been told, you can't do it!
2083500	2088500	No! You can't do it! You can't do this!
2088500	2092500	Oh my God! Anything can happen in the WWF!
