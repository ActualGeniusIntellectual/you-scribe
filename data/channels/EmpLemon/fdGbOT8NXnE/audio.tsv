0	6800	People of YouTube, it is I, everyone's favorite YouTuber Killer Keemstar and today we have some
6800	13360	killer news, some breaking news to discuss that's definitely not two months old. Now what I'm going
13360	18000	to talk about today is something that many of you might not even know about at all or even if you
18000	24560	did you probably forgot about it by now but on January 29, 2019 the YouTube Creator Insider
24560	32000	channel uploaded a video where they kind of sort of entertained the idea of possibly removing the
32000	38000	dislike button on YouTube. Another option is just to remove dislikes entirely from YouTube. That's
38000	44080	a very extreme option. That one seems like kind of not super democratic in my opinion. Now this
44080	48640	is something that YouTube has foreshadowed for a while and it's something that I've been fearing
48640	54560	happening for a long time. This is something, the prospect of YouTube removing the dislike button,
54560	60320	this is something I've been theorizing for years. Even back when I made YouTube poops I thought of
60320	66240	this idea back when they changed the colors of the dislikes. It used to be green and red and then
66240	71600	all of a sudden they changed it to blue and gray. It's just blue and not a color. With the constant
71600	78320	updates to the UI they've been minimizing the dislike bar. Now obviously in this video they
78320	83600	don't say anything definitive. They really just kind of throw the idea out there and treat it as
83600	88480	sort of a last resort for dealing with what they refer to as the dislike mob which we'll get into
88480	94320	later. But I'd also like to mention that for every massively unpopular feature that nobody likes and
94320	100000	YouTube rolls out anyway they all begin the same way with YouTube teasing it and treating it like
100000	105520	a non-committal optional thing and then it becomes default for the whole site. And the fact of the
105520	111600	matter is that YouTube has presented this idea on the table officially. I was always under the
111600	116640	impression that YouTube was foreshadowing this because with seemingly every major update they
116640	122320	make to the site's user interface the dislike bar appears less and less prominent. There have
122320	128080	also been these bizarre cases of select videos where YouTube seems to be inexplicably removing
128080	133920	dislikes or hiding the accurate dislike number from the public. It seems like something fishy
133920	138640	is going on behind the scenes at YouTube and they are actively looking to either tweak or tamper
138640	143680	with the dislike metric on the website as a whole. Now just like almost all of YouTube's major
143680	149360	proposed changes for the site the idea of removing dislikes is very unpopular. A lot of people seem
149360	154960	to intuitively understand that dislikes matter but I really don't think enough people realize
154960	160400	just how important dislikes are on YouTube. But for as much as most people would like to keep
160400	165680	dislikes around there's a certain camp that actually believes it's a good idea to remove
165680	171280	dislikes from YouTube entirely. So in this video I'm going to do my best to explain why removing
171280	183280	dislikes is not a great idea. But first what exactly is the argument for removing dislikes?
183280	189200	First of all the camp who wants to remove dislikes rely heavily on this idea of a dislike mob which
189200	196000	is terminology that's been used and validated by YouTube itself. Dislike mobs so this is where
196000	202400	a group of people will go to a video not even watch the video and just purposely hit the thumbs
202400	207280	down. And the fear is that by intentionally driving down the ratings of a video it will
207280	212880	negatively affect the perceptions of the audience watching and predispose them to unfairly hate the
212880	217760	video. Additionally they argue that dislikes negatively affect a video's performance in the
217760	223200	algorithm and that enabling the dislike button makes it too easy for opponents to silence your
223200	230000	videos. And finally the dislike function is binary and non-descriptive and user criticism can be
230000	235440	easily supplemented by the comment section therefore making dislikes a redundant feature.
235440	240320	So these are the main arguments for removing dislikes on YouTube. But before we can get into
240320	246720	this discussion we have to first understand the role of dislikes on YouTube. You each have a knob
246720	252000	in front of you when you like what you see turn the knob to the right when you don't like what you
252000	259840	see turn it left. The origin of the dislike dates back to 2010 when YouTube retconned the original
259840	265440	star rating system. It's the simplest and most accessible method that people use to determine
265440	271120	the overall quality of a video. But how exactly do you measure whether a video is good or bad?
271120	276720	I took a sample of 24 recommended videos on my home page. Yeah it's not a perfect sample or
276720	281600	completely generalizable to all of YouTube but it should provide us with a decent enough estimate.
281600	288480	So the 24 videos had a mean rating of 94% and a median rating of 96%. When you click on a YouTube
288480	294400	video there's a good chance that at least 19 out of 20 people liked it. People tend to like YouTube
294400	299920	videos a lot so we have to adjust our standards accordingly. So based on my personal observations
299920	305360	from many years of watching videos on YouTube I've arranged video ratings into seven tiers.
305360	310880	If your video has 99% likes or more you're probably looking at a pretty great video.
310880	316960	98 to 97% is not good enough to be the best but still a good video. Most of the videos you watch
316960	323280	on YouTube will probably fall between 96 and 94% which indicates that the video is pretty average.
323280	328160	At 93 to 90% you're entering the territory where you start to notice that the video has an above
328160	332800	average amount of dislikes. You'll usually see this on videos where the audience disagrees with
332800	338240	the creator on one or two points in the video but otherwise the video is pretty average. At 89 to
338240	342560	80% you're starting to enter controversial territory. You'll typically see this rating on
342560	347840	videos that deal with highly opinionated hot button issues like politics or any review of
347840	353280	The Last Jedi. If your ratings dip below 80% then there is probably something seriously wrong with
353280	358640	your video. Either the video or audio quality is really bad or you made a big mistake in your
358640	364240	research or if you just had a really controversial opinion. This is a stage where the quantity of
364240	369200	dislikes is so abnormal that people actually really start paying attention to it. And finally
369200	374320	if your video ratings drop below 50% then there isn't just something wrong with your video there's
374320	380000	probably something wrong with you. If your ratings drop below this level then you probably said
380000	385280	something so wrong or so out of touch that a huge part of your audience has lost respect for you.
385280	391360	And you may have done irreparable damage to your online reputation. So that's generally how I
391360	395680	categorize ratings on YouTube videos. It's not going to be perfect. You're going to be able to
395680	401760	find non-examples but by and large this list is going to be fairly accurate. And you can generally
401760	407600	use YouTube ratings to heuristically predict the nature of a video. But before we go any further
407600	412560	I have a few more important things to explain about dislikes. First of all I see a lot of people
412560	418080	under the impression that YouTube video ratings imply quality. That's not exactly true. You can
418080	422720	have a very high quality video production wise but if people disagree with the core message then
422720	427680	they're going to press dislike. More accurately ratings on YouTube represent a measure of
427680	433280	controversiality. Second when videos are uploaded ratings tend to start high then gradually regress
433280	438320	to the mean as the video becomes more widely circulated. Generally older videos with high
438320	442640	view counts will have lower overall ratings because they've been exposed to a greater number
442640	448880	of people. And finally older YouTubers with large dedicated followings tend to have better overall
448880	453600	ratings than newer YouTubers. This is simply because the longer you watch a YouTuber the more
453600	458560	you tend to trust them and the more likely you are to engage with their content. So naturally
458560	462880	YouTubers that have been around for a while and have a huge core audience are going to get a lot
462880	467840	more likes on each video as opposed to an unproven guy who nobody knows about. Therefore
467840	472560	older YouTubers tend to get a lot more likes per video which skews their overall ratings in their
472560	478800	favor. So if dislikes aren't an indicator of quality then what exactly is the function of
478800	490480	dislikes on YouTube? Well at a fundamental level dislikes are a reflection of the extent to which
490480	495680	people disagree with the core message of a video. Like I said earlier you could have the most
495680	500800	expensive production with the slickest editing possible but if people don't like what you're
500800	505040	saying and how you're saying it you're gonna wind up with a lot of dislikes on YouTube.
505040	510240	I have to reiterate that dislikes are not a measure of objective quality rather it measures
510240	515280	a difference in opinion. And with that being said it's the single most important line of
515280	520880	communication between an audience and a creator. Your success as a creator on YouTube will almost
520880	527760	inevitably depend on how you respond to dislikes. Now if you're someone like Dan Olson who believes
527760	532320	that dislikes shouldn't exist on YouTube then you'd probably also be the same type of person
532320	538720	to disable ratings on your own videos. Ah shit here we go again. Trust me when I say that this
538720	543760	is one of the worst things you can do as a YouTuber. Seriously in all my days on this
543760	548960	site I've never encountered a single successful and respected YouTuber who frequently disables
548960	553920	their ratings. To understand why you have to realize why most people watch YouTube in the first
553920	559760	place and that's to express their interests and opinions. Whether that be through their uploads,
559760	566480	watch history, comments, and yes their ratings. When you choose to disable ratings on a video
566480	571120	you are deliberately depriving your audience of one of their expressive outlets and you're
571120	577040	consequently degrading their experience as a viewer. Even if they agree with you if your goal
577040	582160	on YouTube is to not be hated by your audience then you probably shouldn't disable ratings.
582160	588640	And yet here we see Dan Olson committing the cardinal sin. If you know anything about how
588640	594320	YouTube works you'd have to realize that this is a boneheaded decision. I mean really anybody
594320	599360	who expects people to support them after disabling ratings on their YouTube videos must be completely
599360	606800	irrational. But let's assume that he is rational. Clearly something has led poor Danny boy here to
606800	611680	intentionally degrade the experience of all his viewers. Well if you asked him he'd probably
611680	616800	tell you that he disabled his ratings to protect himself from the nefarious dislike mobs. So let's
616800	623600	talk about dislike mobs. You were 100% convinced that those negative reviews were part of a
623600	628640	conspiracy. I feel like I'm in a rather privileged position to talk about this since I literally
628640	634160	started one in 2017 when I encouraged people to go dislike the YouTube Rewind and make it the most
634160	641360	disliked video of all time. It didn't work. Kind of. I guess it was a year too early. Now the vernacular
641360	646400	of a dislike mob conjures up images of a torch-wielding horde of deranged maniacs who
646400	651760	mindlessly spam dislike on whatever unfortunate video gets in their way. In reality what you may
651760	656640	perceive as a dislike mob is almost certainly just a large group of people who simply disagreed with
656640	661840	the fundamental message of your video. Why did the YouTube Rewind 2018 become the most disliked
661840	667440	video of all time? Could it possibly be because a racist bigoted dislike mob conspired against the
667440	675520	video's diversity message? No. I think we should read the comments. People dislike the Rewind
675520	680000	because most people don't like the slick corporate brand friendly image that the site is trying to
680000	685200	create for itself by excluding grassroots YouTubers like PewDiePie and MrBeast. People
685200	690000	don't like being lectured about the importance of tolerating gay people by a company that has
690000	695280	repeatedly demonstrated that they don't actually care about gay people. People don't like the idea
695280	699760	of Hollywood celebrities, Twitch streamers, and Instagram models populating a video that is
699760	704560	supposedly about celebrating YouTubers. Do you kind of see where I'm going with this?
704560	708800	If your YouTube videos are getting a lot of dislikes and your initial reaction is that
708800	714240	there's an evil mob of radicals conspiring against you, then there's probably a more
714240	719760	reasonable explanation. Chef Ramsay had the absolute nerve to reach out to Yelpers.
719760	726240	They are deliberately attacking my restaurant. Every Yelper lies. They hurt and damage
726240	731440	restaurants by doing this. It is front page news across the country. As one would imagine,
731440	736240	Mueller found collusion between President Trump, his campaign in Russia. The president obstructed
736240	740080	justice. There will be new indictments to conservatives. If there's indictments, then
740080	744560	clearly this has ended with Russian collusion. All indictments have been related to conspiring
744560	751200	with Russians. It cost more than 25 million cocks and about 500 penises over 9,000 penises.
751200	756160	There was obstruction. So, Mr. Drumpf, you admit you conspired with Russians.
756720	763520	What do you have to say in your defense? Coincidence? I think not super democratic.
763520	768880	Now, the Dan Olson type might counter this by saying that the dislike mob is a legitimate
768880	774080	threat because the rating system potentially allows large and powerful groups to harass small,
774080	778240	independent YouTubers whom they view as... Next, we're bullying me!
779200	783200	I mean, look what happened when iDubbbz sent his army of fans to attack Leafy.
783920	789280	Oh, wait. iDubbbz had a smaller channel at the time. But what about that time when I,
789280	793840	the devilish butthole Emperor Lemon, sent all of my fans to go harass behind the meme?
794800	799840	Ooh, yeah, um... Bullying!
799840	803360	Yeah, it turns out that on YouTube, people tend to support the underdog.
803360	808000	But I'm sure these are just two anecdotal examples that I cherry-picked, and they certainly don't
808000	813680	reflect the true threat of dislike mobs like, oh say, the list of the most disliked YouTube
813680	818240	videos ever. Welcome to WatchMojo.com and still be counting down number one.
818240	824400	Coming in at number one is, once again, the 2018 YouTube Rewind, which saw an unprecedented volume
824400	828880	of dislikes on a video. But it's clearly just a dislike mob who hates diversity.
828880	833440	Can we also give a moment to Asian representation in entertainment this year?
833440	834480	Number two...
834480	837760	Number two is a music video called Baby by independent,
837760	842080	small-time music artist Justin Bieber. Looks like the dislike mob here is just
842080	845520	discriminating against Canadians. Number three...
845520	849680	Number three is It's Everyday Bro by small underground YouTuber Jake Paul.
850240	855200	Obviously, the lyrical and melodic content of this renaissance masterpiece deserves the highest
855200	859840	of praise, and all these dislikes are just from a mob of haters whom we should dab on.
859840	862240	Make sure you're dabbing on them haters, baby!
862240	864400	Dab. Dab. Dab.
864400	865600	Number four...
865600	870400	Number four is a video from the small YouTuber PewDiePie in a video where he literally asks
870400	874800	his fans to dislike it, but I'm sure some of those came from a mob.
874880	877840	The racist, sexist, homophobic...
877840	878480	Worldview.
878480	879200	Worldview.
879200	880000	Society.
880000	880880	Number five...
883600	884800	Enough is enough.
884800	886640	Make sure you dabbing on them haters.
886640	888560	Make sure you dabbing on them haters.
888560	889280	Institutions.
889280	890880	Dabbing on them haters.
890880	895200	But what if we took the same list and ordered it by highest percentage of dislikes?
895200	899440	Man, it's gonna take a real evil and dedicated mob to do that kind of damage.
899440	904640	Well, organized in this order, the most disliked videos feature the targeted harassment of frail
904640	912400	victims such as YouTube, Call of Duty, the NFL, PewDiePie, RiceGum, YouTube again, and
912400	918960	the number one spot, coming in with over 98% dislikes, a video so hated that the creator
918960	922160	had to issue a copyright claim against herself to take it down.
922720	928720	It's some Brazilian celebrity who was encouraging her fans to vote against a political candidate.
928720	933440	No matter how you slice it, the aggregate power of the dislike is used
933440	937520	overwhelmingly against big corporate entities.
937520	942000	Do we really want to give nuclear weapons to a man whose signature move is firing?
942000	942480	Firing.
942480	943680	Firing things?
943680	944640	Yes!
944640	949360	The true dislike mob is often just the common YouTuber pushing back against their corporate
949360	949920	overlords.
950640	956800	Since the very beginning of the feature, YouTubers have used the dislike as a spiritual veto
956800	962400	against slimy manipulation by politicians and corporations, not the other way around.
962960	968480	Now tell me, does Dan Olson look like the type of guy who wants to put more power in
968480	970560	the hands of wealthy corporations?
970560	974800	Well, that's exactly what would happen if he got his wish of YouTube removing dislikes.
974800	978480	You don't need to be in the pew every Sunday to know that there's something wrong in this
978480	981840	country when gays can serve openly in the military.
981840	987040	But I mean, clearly just because the dislike is frequently used by the common people to
987040	992640	hashtag resist the evil corporations, it can still happen the other way around.
992640	997600	I mean, big powerful groups have the incentive to do so because dislikes negatively affect
997600	999280	your videos in the algorithm.
999280	1002080	Except there's absolutely no evidence of this.
1002080	1002960	At all.
1002960	1007680	According to my YouTube analytics, my Jimmy Kimmel video received a huge spike in dislikes
1007680	1009840	on April 20th, 2018.
1009840	1012400	Uh oh, looks like the dislike mob got to me.
1012400	1015280	Better disable my ratings before my views drop.
1015280	1016880	Except I didn't.
1016880	1020640	And the video still gets plenty of views, even though the proportion of dislikes has
1020640	1022640	continued to increase over time.
1022640	1026960	You may write this off as just circumstantial evidence, but if you ask any YouTuber out
1026960	1031920	there who isn't terrified of the dislike mob boogeyman, they'll tell you the same thing
1031920	1035440	that dislikes have no direct effect on viewership.
1035440	1041200	The only YouTube feature that has been demonstrably proven to reduce viewership is demonetization.
1046960	1047840	Well, whatever.
1047840	1052800	I guess you could still somehow justify disabling ratings because at least the comments give
1052800	1054000	better feedback.
1054000	1058320	Because it's not like the YouTube comment system is notorious for being a cesspool of
1058320	1061840	knuckleheads impulsively spewing their uninformed opinions.
1061840	1067360	And it's also widely understood that comments are certainly not populated by a vocal minority
1067360	1072400	of more radical viewers who will inevitably form a cult of personality around you if you
1072400	1073520	cater to them.
1073520	1075520	Are you saying my money's all gone?
1076400	1079760	But I made all the right moves, didn't I?
1079760	1080800	Oh, yes, sir.
1080800	1082000	Every move a right one.
1082000	1085440	Yep, comments are definitely a better feedback system than dislikes.
1085440	1087360	I'm really glad I disabled them.
1087360	1091680	So glad, in fact, that I believe YouTube should disable dislikes for the entire platform.
1091680	1093120	I think it's a great idea.
1093120	1095520	And for that reason, other people should, too.
1095520	1097680	I'm so smart and correct about everything.
1097680	1100080	Just look at all these comments agreeing with me.
1100080	1102160	Man, I can picture it now.
1102160	1105680	The dislike free utopian future of YouTube.
1105680	1106240	Wait a minute.
1106240	1111280	That's just Facebook, a site where people act like machines, corporations act like people
1111280	1113520	and machines act like CEOs.
1113520	1115760	A very utopian place indeed.
1115760	1117600	But hey, at least there's no dislikes.
1117600	1122320	And we all know that the lack of dislikes promotes great content and discussion on Facebook.
1122880	1124320	Or how about Twitter?
1124320	1128160	No dislikes to be found here without a dislike button to weaponize.
1128160	1131280	There are certainly no angry mobs wreaking havoc in this place.
1131920	1134640	Oh, man, I'm about to contradict myself here.
1134640	1138720	But Reddit has a dislike feature and the discussion sucks here, too.
1138720	1143840	You ignorant, self-serving, killjoy, nitpicking, burger cutting bitch.
1144400	1147040	I guess that's bad news for dislikes on YouTube.
1147680	1151040	Except dislikes on YouTube don't affect the visibility of your posts.
1152160	1156960	But maybe there's a better and more fair comment system than Reddit, like this one.
1156960	1159920	Oh, wait, this is the YouTube comment system
1159920	1164560	where dislikes have been disabled for almost five years now and it's still a cesspool.
1166080	1169360	Well, if we're talking about cesspools, let's throw in 4chan.
1169360	1172160	No dislikes here or even likes for that matter.
1172160	1176160	Surely this is the pinnacle of utopian mob free discourse.
1176720	1183200	Now tell me, does Dan Olson look like the type of guy who would prefer 4chan over Reddit?
1183200	1184080	I think not.
1184880	1186160	Am I so out of touch?
1187680	1189680	No, it's the children who are wrong.
1189680	1190720	Here's the thing.
1190720	1194480	People like classifying and ranking things in a hierarchy.
1194480	1196400	We do this intuitively.
1196400	1200880	It's based on how our brains organize and categorize information.
1200880	1206240	There's a reason why WatchMojo, one of the most bland and boring channels ever,
1206240	1211840	can forge a 20 million subscriber empire from making nothing but top 10 lists.
1211840	1216160	People have a natural fascination with ranking things in some kind of order
1216160	1219120	and they do the same thing with likes and dislikes.
1219120	1221840	People want to know what's good and what's bad
1221840	1225040	and sweeping your ratings under the rug won't change that.
1225040	1227840	Every website that doesn't have a dislike function
1227840	1231280	has users who try to supplement it through some other means.
1231280	1234160	On Facebook, you have the angry react.
1234160	1236160	On Twitter, people get ratioed.
1236160	1238560	On 4chan, people try to get used.
1238560	1241280	And that brings me to the main point of this video.
1241280	1245200	Just because you can't see the dislikes doesn't mean they don't exist.
1245760	1249680	It's childish and you're starting to see this mentality everywhere.
1249680	1252800	Oh no, people didn't like this movie with a woman in it?
1252800	1256240	I guess it's just a dislike mob who supports the patriarchy.
1256240	1259440	Oh no, you disagree with my impeccable opinion?
1259440	1261920	I guess I have no choice but to block you,
1261920	1264720	since I can't see anyone who disagrees with me.
1264720	1266800	That must mean everyone agrees with me.
1267360	1272720	You could put half of Trump supporters into what I call the basket of deplorables.
1272800	1277200	Now having said all this, why aren't I 50 points ahead, you might ask?
1277200	1280960	I swear some people online are so averse to basic discourse
1280960	1283440	that they unlearn object permanence.
1283440	1287040	Except it's not object permanence, it's dislike permanence.
1287040	1289600	Let's face it, you can say anything online
1289600	1292400	and a small fraction of people will hate you for it.
1292400	1294080	That much is inevitable.
1294080	1296400	As any sort of content creator online,
1296400	1298320	you will almost certainly encounter a moment
1298320	1301440	when you're faced with an unprecedented amount of backlash.
1301440	1304480	I always go back to the example of my Behind the Meme video.
1304480	1308080	Do you know how easy it would have been for me to simply write off all the criticism
1308080	1310880	as a bunch of pissed off Behind the Meme fanboys?
1310880	1314080	But I didn't do that because it simply wasn't true.
1314080	1318480	I had to swallow my pride and acknowledge that a lot of the criticism was fair
1318480	1322240	and I used that criticism to gradually improve my approaches.
1322240	1323360	And guess what?
1323360	1326320	I don't get as many dislikes on my newer videos.
1326320	1330640	I made the dislikes go away without having to shamelessly hide them.
1330720	1332640	IT'S TIME FOR THE PILL!
1346160	1348560	YouTubers tend to fear dislikes.
1348560	1352880	Even though as a YouTuber, dislikes are one of your most valuable assets.
1353520	1355840	It's easy to preach to your own choir.
1355840	1360320	It's difficult to preach to strangers who have never seen you before in their lives.
1360320	1363200	YouTube is all about appealing to niche audiences.
1363200	1368160	But the more you grow, the harder it becomes to have all of your audience on the same page.
1368160	1370400	If you're starting to see more dislikes,
1370400	1374800	well it probably just means that your channel is starting to grow outside of its comfort zone.
1374800	1375760	And that's okay.
1376320	1379600	Dislikes are just a natural part of growing on YouTube.
1379600	1382720	They're a sign that new people are watching your videos.
1382720	1386240	You can either accommodate the new viewers or stick to your niche.
1386240	1387440	The choice is yours.
1387440	1391920	But if you so choose to treat dislikes as a germ that must be eradicated,
1391920	1395680	don't be surprised when eventually the new people stop showing up.
1395680	1399280	Dislikes are one of the only lines of communication between you,
1399280	1403920	the creator, and the audience member who is discovering you for the very first time.
1403920	1409200	Most people won't spend the effort to type up a comment or click on any link you have in the description.
1409200	1413120	But at the very least, they will press dislike on your video.
1413120	1416080	And yes, some of the critics are going to be unreasonable.
1416080	1420320	And you can never please everybody and you shouldn't try to please everybody.
1420320	1423440	But critics will give you something that your fans won't.
1423440	1426240	And that's honest, unfiltered feedback.
1426880	1430480	Truth is one of the most valuable resources no matter where you go.
1430480	1432240	From the looks of last year's Rewind,
1432240	1436800	it would seem that the YouTube community is really trying to tell YouTube the truth.
1436800	1437600	Let's hope they listen.
1437600	1440320	...unexpectedly broke a record with Rewind,
1440320	1443200	creating the most disliked video on the internet.
1443760	1446400	Even at home, my kids told me it was cringey.
1446400	1448320	We hear you that it didn't accurately show...
1448320	1452320	A dislike on a YouTube video has never harmed a person.
1452320	1454480	They only harm egos.
1454480	1459120	There's a reason why YouTube only suddenly decided to start talking about dislikes
1459120	1461840	after their video became the most disliked in history.
1461840	1463520	It's not a coincidence.
1463520	1467440	Dislikes make people pay attention and yank them back down to earth.
1467440	1471760	There's no bigger wake-up call as a YouTuber than seeing that ratings bar dip below 80%.
1472640	1474720	Or in YouTube's case, below 20%.
1475600	1476800	It gets to you.
1476800	1477760	You remember that.
1477760	1479840	It's a big fat slap on the wrist.
1479840	1483200	It forces you to stop and re-evaluate what you're doing.
1483200	1487280	It makes you wonder that maybe you're not as good as you think you are.
1487280	1490560	Critics will tell you the truth and won't sugarcoat it.
1490560	1494640	You can argue about how they're wrong all you want, but they don't think they're wrong.
1494640	1498400	And there are many people who probably agree with them and not you.
1498400	1499600	Are they all wrong?
1499600	1501360	Or are you just out of touch?
1501360	1503520	One of these is far more likely than the other.
1503520	1507440	But once again, whichever one you want to believe is your choice.
1507440	1508480	So choose wisely.
1511200	1515680	You know, sometimes you get dislikes on YouTube videos because people meant to press like,
1515680	1518000	but they accidentally pressed the wrong button.
1518000	1520960	And obviously it's not that big of a deal because
1520960	1523840	at least they didn't press the wrong button on something more important.
1523840	1527680	Like, say, deciding the future of internet regulation for an entire continent.
1528560	1532240	We interrupt this program to bring you downward spiral.
1532240	1533120	That's right, Europe.
1533120	1537600	You had elected officials literally press the wrong button while voting for some of
1537600	1541040	the most influential internet regulation in your lifetime.
1541040	1543040	Oh, you stupid son of a-
1543040	1545040	I'm sorry I'm not good.
1545680	1547760	Please forgive me.
1547760	1550000	I'm just European.
1550000	1553680	If your elected officials can't even be trusted to press the right button,
1553680	1556640	maybe it's time to take matters into your own hands.
