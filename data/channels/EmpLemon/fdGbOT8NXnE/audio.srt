00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,800
People of YouTube, it is I, everyone's favorite YouTuber Killer Keemstar and today we have some

2
00:00:06,800 --> 00:00:13,360
killer news, some breaking news to discuss that's definitely not two months old. Now what I'm going

3
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:18,000
to talk about today is something that many of you might not even know about at all or even if you

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:24,560
did you probably forgot about it by now but on January 29, 2019 the YouTube Creator Insider

5
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:32,000
channel uploaded a video where they kind of sort of entertained the idea of possibly removing the

6
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:38,000
dislike button on YouTube. Another option is just to remove dislikes entirely from YouTube. That's

7
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:44,080
a very extreme option. That one seems like kind of not super democratic in my opinion. Now this

8
00:00:44,080 --> 00:00:48,640
is something that YouTube has foreshadowed for a while and it's something that I've been fearing

9
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:54,560
happening for a long time. This is something, the prospect of YouTube removing the dislike button,

10
00:00:54,560 --> 00:01:00,320
this is something I've been theorizing for years. Even back when I made YouTube poops I thought of

11
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:06,240
this idea back when they changed the colors of the dislikes. It used to be green and red and then

12
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:11,600
all of a sudden they changed it to blue and gray. It's just blue and not a color. With the constant

13
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:18,320
updates to the UI they've been minimizing the dislike bar. Now obviously in this video they

14
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:23,600
don't say anything definitive. They really just kind of throw the idea out there and treat it as

15
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:28,480
sort of a last resort for dealing with what they refer to as the dislike mob which we'll get into

16
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:34,320
later. But I'd also like to mention that for every massively unpopular feature that nobody likes and

17
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:40,000
YouTube rolls out anyway they all begin the same way with YouTube teasing it and treating it like

18
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:45,520
a non-committal optional thing and then it becomes default for the whole site. And the fact of the

19
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:51,600
matter is that YouTube has presented this idea on the table officially. I was always under the

20
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:56,640
impression that YouTube was foreshadowing this because with seemingly every major update they

21
00:01:56,640 --> 00:02:02,320
make to the site's user interface the dislike bar appears less and less prominent. There have

22
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:08,080
also been these bizarre cases of select videos where YouTube seems to be inexplicably removing

23
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:13,920
dislikes or hiding the accurate dislike number from the public. It seems like something fishy

24
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:18,640
is going on behind the scenes at YouTube and they are actively looking to either tweak or tamper

25
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:23,680
with the dislike metric on the website as a whole. Now just like almost all of YouTube's major

26
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:29,360
proposed changes for the site the idea of removing dislikes is very unpopular. A lot of people seem

27
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:34,960
to intuitively understand that dislikes matter but I really don't think enough people realize

28
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:40,400
just how important dislikes are on YouTube. But for as much as most people would like to keep

29
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:45,680
dislikes around there's a certain camp that actually believes it's a good idea to remove

30
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:51,280
dislikes from YouTube entirely. So in this video I'm going to do my best to explain why removing

31
00:02:51,280 --> 00:03:03,280
dislikes is not a great idea. But first what exactly is the argument for removing dislikes?

32
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:09,200
First of all the camp who wants to remove dislikes rely heavily on this idea of a dislike mob which

33
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:16,000
is terminology that's been used and validated by YouTube itself. Dislike mobs so this is where

34
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:22,400
a group of people will go to a video not even watch the video and just purposely hit the thumbs

35
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:27,280
down. And the fear is that by intentionally driving down the ratings of a video it will

36
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:32,880
negatively affect the perceptions of the audience watching and predispose them to unfairly hate the

37
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:37,760
video. Additionally they argue that dislikes negatively affect a video's performance in the

38
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:43,200
algorithm and that enabling the dislike button makes it too easy for opponents to silence your

39
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:50,000
videos. And finally the dislike function is binary and non-descriptive and user criticism can be

40
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:55,440
easily supplemented by the comment section therefore making dislikes a redundant feature.

41
00:03:55,440 --> 00:04:00,320
So these are the main arguments for removing dislikes on YouTube. But before we can get into

42
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:06,720
this discussion we have to first understand the role of dislikes on YouTube. You each have a knob

43
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:12,000
in front of you when you like what you see turn the knob to the right when you don't like what you

44
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:19,840
see turn it left. The origin of the dislike dates back to 2010 when YouTube retconned the original

45
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:25,440
star rating system. It's the simplest and most accessible method that people use to determine

46
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:31,120
the overall quality of a video. But how exactly do you measure whether a video is good or bad?

47
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:36,720
I took a sample of 24 recommended videos on my home page. Yeah it's not a perfect sample or

48
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:41,600
completely generalizable to all of YouTube but it should provide us with a decent enough estimate.

49
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:48,480
So the 24 videos had a mean rating of 94% and a median rating of 96%. When you click on a YouTube

50
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:54,400
video there's a good chance that at least 19 out of 20 people liked it. People tend to like YouTube

51
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:59,920
videos a lot so we have to adjust our standards accordingly. So based on my personal observations

52
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:05,360
from many years of watching videos on YouTube I've arranged video ratings into seven tiers.

53
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:10,880
If your video has 99% likes or more you're probably looking at a pretty great video.

54
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:16,960
98 to 97% is not good enough to be the best but still a good video. Most of the videos you watch

55
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:23,280
on YouTube will probably fall between 96 and 94% which indicates that the video is pretty average.

56
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:28,160
At 93 to 90% you're entering the territory where you start to notice that the video has an above

57
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:32,800
average amount of dislikes. You'll usually see this on videos where the audience disagrees with

58
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:38,240
the creator on one or two points in the video but otherwise the video is pretty average. At 89 to

59
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:42,560
80% you're starting to enter controversial territory. You'll typically see this rating on

60
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:47,840
videos that deal with highly opinionated hot button issues like politics or any review of

61
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:53,280
The Last Jedi. If your ratings dip below 80% then there is probably something seriously wrong with

62
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:58,640
your video. Either the video or audio quality is really bad or you made a big mistake in your

63
00:05:58,640 --> 00:06:04,240
research or if you just had a really controversial opinion. This is a stage where the quantity of

64
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:09,200
dislikes is so abnormal that people actually really start paying attention to it. And finally

65
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:14,320
if your video ratings drop below 50% then there isn't just something wrong with your video there's

66
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:20,000
probably something wrong with you. If your ratings drop below this level then you probably said

67
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:25,280
something so wrong or so out of touch that a huge part of your audience has lost respect for you.

68
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:31,360
And you may have done irreparable damage to your online reputation. So that's generally how I

69
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:35,680
categorize ratings on YouTube videos. It's not going to be perfect. You're going to be able to

70
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:41,760
find non-examples but by and large this list is going to be fairly accurate. And you can generally

71
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:47,600
use YouTube ratings to heuristically predict the nature of a video. But before we go any further

72
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:52,560
I have a few more important things to explain about dislikes. First of all I see a lot of people

73
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:58,080
under the impression that YouTube video ratings imply quality. That's not exactly true. You can

74
00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:02,720
have a very high quality video production wise but if people disagree with the core message then

75
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:07,680
they're going to press dislike. More accurately ratings on YouTube represent a measure of

76
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:13,280
controversiality. Second when videos are uploaded ratings tend to start high then gradually regress

77
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:18,320
to the mean as the video becomes more widely circulated. Generally older videos with high

78
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:22,640
view counts will have lower overall ratings because they've been exposed to a greater number

79
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:28,880
of people. And finally older YouTubers with large dedicated followings tend to have better overall

80
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:33,600
ratings than newer YouTubers. This is simply because the longer you watch a YouTuber the more

81
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:38,560
you tend to trust them and the more likely you are to engage with their content. So naturally

82
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:42,880
YouTubers that have been around for a while and have a huge core audience are going to get a lot

83
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:47,840
more likes on each video as opposed to an unproven guy who nobody knows about. Therefore

84
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:52,560
older YouTubers tend to get a lot more likes per video which skews their overall ratings in their

85
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:58,800
favor. So if dislikes aren't an indicator of quality then what exactly is the function of

86
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:10,480
dislikes on YouTube? Well at a fundamental level dislikes are a reflection of the extent to which

87
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:15,680
people disagree with the core message of a video. Like I said earlier you could have the most

88
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:20,800
expensive production with the slickest editing possible but if people don't like what you're

89
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:25,040
saying and how you're saying it you're gonna wind up with a lot of dislikes on YouTube.

90
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:30,240
I have to reiterate that dislikes are not a measure of objective quality rather it measures

91
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:35,280
a difference in opinion. And with that being said it's the single most important line of

92
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:40,880
communication between an audience and a creator. Your success as a creator on YouTube will almost

93
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:47,760
inevitably depend on how you respond to dislikes. Now if you're someone like Dan Olson who believes

94
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:52,320
that dislikes shouldn't exist on YouTube then you'd probably also be the same type of person

95
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:58,720
to disable ratings on your own videos. Ah shit here we go again. Trust me when I say that this

96
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:03,760
is one of the worst things you can do as a YouTuber. Seriously in all my days on this

97
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:08,960
site I've never encountered a single successful and respected YouTuber who frequently disables

98
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:13,920
their ratings. To understand why you have to realize why most people watch YouTube in the first

99
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:19,760
place and that's to express their interests and opinions. Whether that be through their uploads,

100
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:26,480
watch history, comments, and yes their ratings. When you choose to disable ratings on a video

101
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:31,120
you are deliberately depriving your audience of one of their expressive outlets and you're

102
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:37,040
consequently degrading their experience as a viewer. Even if they agree with you if your goal

103
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:42,160
on YouTube is to not be hated by your audience then you probably shouldn't disable ratings.

104
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:48,640
And yet here we see Dan Olson committing the cardinal sin. If you know anything about how

105
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:54,320
YouTube works you'd have to realize that this is a boneheaded decision. I mean really anybody

106
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:59,360
who expects people to support them after disabling ratings on their YouTube videos must be completely

107
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:06,800
irrational. But let's assume that he is rational. Clearly something has led poor Danny boy here to

108
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:11,680
intentionally degrade the experience of all his viewers. Well if you asked him he'd probably

109
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:16,800
tell you that he disabled his ratings to protect himself from the nefarious dislike mobs. So let's

110
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:23,600
talk about dislike mobs. You were 100% convinced that those negative reviews were part of a

111
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:28,640
conspiracy. I feel like I'm in a rather privileged position to talk about this since I literally

112
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:34,160
started one in 2017 when I encouraged people to go dislike the YouTube Rewind and make it the most

113
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:41,360
disliked video of all time. It didn't work. Kind of. I guess it was a year too early. Now the vernacular

114
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:46,400
of a dislike mob conjures up images of a torch-wielding horde of deranged maniacs who

115
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:51,760
mindlessly spam dislike on whatever unfortunate video gets in their way. In reality what you may

116
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:56,640
perceive as a dislike mob is almost certainly just a large group of people who simply disagreed with

117
00:10:56,640 --> 00:11:01,840
the fundamental message of your video. Why did the YouTube Rewind 2018 become the most disliked

118
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:07,440
video of all time? Could it possibly be because a racist bigoted dislike mob conspired against the

119
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:15,520
video's diversity message? No. I think we should read the comments. People dislike the Rewind

120
00:11:15,520 --> 00:11:20,000
because most people don't like the slick corporate brand friendly image that the site is trying to

121
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:25,200
create for itself by excluding grassroots YouTubers like PewDiePie and MrBeast. People

122
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:30,000
don't like being lectured about the importance of tolerating gay people by a company that has

123
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:35,280
repeatedly demonstrated that they don't actually care about gay people. People don't like the idea

124
00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:39,760
of Hollywood celebrities, Twitch streamers, and Instagram models populating a video that is

125
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:44,560
supposedly about celebrating YouTubers. Do you kind of see where I'm going with this?

126
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:48,800
If your YouTube videos are getting a lot of dislikes and your initial reaction is that

127
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:54,240
there's an evil mob of radicals conspiring against you, then there's probably a more

128
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:59,760
reasonable explanation. Chef Ramsay had the absolute nerve to reach out to Yelpers.

129
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:06,240
They are deliberately attacking my restaurant. Every Yelper lies. They hurt and damage

130
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:11,440
restaurants by doing this. It is front page news across the country. As one would imagine,

131
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:16,240
Mueller found collusion between President Trump, his campaign in Russia. The president obstructed

132
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:20,080
justice. There will be new indictments to conservatives. If there's indictments, then

133
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:24,560
clearly this has ended with Russian collusion. All indictments have been related to conspiring

134
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:31,200
with Russians. It cost more than 25 million cocks and about 500 penises over 9,000 penises.

135
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:36,160
There was obstruction. So, Mr. Drumpf, you admit you conspired with Russians.

136
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:43,520
What do you have to say in your defense? Coincidence? I think not super democratic.

137
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:48,880
Now, the Dan Olson type might counter this by saying that the dislike mob is a legitimate

138
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:54,080
threat because the rating system potentially allows large and powerful groups to harass small,

139
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:58,240
independent YouTubers whom they view as... Next, we're bullying me!

140
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:03,200
I mean, look what happened when iDubbbz sent his army of fans to attack Leafy.

141
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:09,280
Oh, wait. iDubbbz had a smaller channel at the time. But what about that time when I,

142
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:13,840
the devilish butthole Emperor Lemon, sent all of my fans to go harass behind the meme?

143
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:19,840
Ooh, yeah, um... Bullying!

144
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:23,360
Yeah, it turns out that on YouTube, people tend to support the underdog.

145
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:28,000
But I'm sure these are just two anecdotal examples that I cherry-picked, and they certainly don't

146
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:33,680
reflect the true threat of dislike mobs like, oh say, the list of the most disliked YouTube

147
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:38,240
videos ever. Welcome to WatchMojo.com and still be counting down number one.

148
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:44,400
Coming in at number one is, once again, the 2018 YouTube Rewind, which saw an unprecedented volume

149
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:48,880
of dislikes on a video. But it's clearly just a dislike mob who hates diversity.

150
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:53,440
Can we also give a moment to Asian representation in entertainment this year?

151
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:54,480
Number two...

152
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:57,760
Number two is a music video called Baby by independent,

153
00:13:57,760 --> 00:14:02,080
small-time music artist Justin Bieber. Looks like the dislike mob here is just

154
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:05,520
discriminating against Canadians. Number three...

155
00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:09,680
Number three is It's Everyday Bro by small underground YouTuber Jake Paul.

156
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:15,200
Obviously, the lyrical and melodic content of this renaissance masterpiece deserves the highest

157
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:19,840
of praise, and all these dislikes are just from a mob of haters whom we should dab on.

158
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:22,240
Make sure you're dabbing on them haters, baby!

159
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:24,400
Dab. Dab. Dab.

160
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:25,600
Number four...

161
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:30,400
Number four is a video from the small YouTuber PewDiePie in a video where he literally asks

162
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:34,800
his fans to dislike it, but I'm sure some of those came from a mob.

163
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:37,840
The racist, sexist, homophobic...

164
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:38,480
Worldview.

165
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:39,200
Worldview.

166
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:40,000
Society.

167
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:40,880
Number five...

168
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:44,800
Enough is enough.

169
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:46,640
Make sure you dabbing on them haters.

170
00:14:46,640 --> 00:14:48,560
Make sure you dabbing on them haters.

171
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:49,280
Institutions.

172
00:14:49,280 --> 00:14:50,880
Dabbing on them haters.

173
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:55,200
But what if we took the same list and ordered it by highest percentage of dislikes?

174
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:59,440
Man, it's gonna take a real evil and dedicated mob to do that kind of damage.

175
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:04,640
Well, organized in this order, the most disliked videos feature the targeted harassment of frail

176
00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:12,400
victims such as YouTube, Call of Duty, the NFL, PewDiePie, RiceGum, YouTube again, and

177
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:18,960
the number one spot, coming in with over 98% dislikes, a video so hated that the creator

178
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:22,160
had to issue a copyright claim against herself to take it down.

179
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:28,720
It's some Brazilian celebrity who was encouraging her fans to vote against a political candidate.

180
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:33,440
No matter how you slice it, the aggregate power of the dislike is used

181
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:37,520
overwhelmingly against big corporate entities.

182
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:42,000
Do we really want to give nuclear weapons to a man whose signature move is firing?

183
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:42,480
Firing.

184
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:43,680
Firing things?

185
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:44,640
Yes!

186
00:15:44,640 --> 00:15:49,360
The true dislike mob is often just the common YouTuber pushing back against their corporate

187
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:49,920
overlords.

188
00:15:50,640 --> 00:15:56,800
Since the very beginning of the feature, YouTubers have used the dislike as a spiritual veto

189
00:15:56,800 --> 00:16:02,400
against slimy manipulation by politicians and corporations, not the other way around.

190
00:16:02,960 --> 00:16:08,480
Now tell me, does Dan Olson look like the type of guy who wants to put more power in

191
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:10,560
the hands of wealthy corporations?

192
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:14,800
Well, that's exactly what would happen if he got his wish of YouTube removing dislikes.

193
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:18,480
You don't need to be in the pew every Sunday to know that there's something wrong in this

194
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:21,840
country when gays can serve openly in the military.

195
00:16:21,840 --> 00:16:27,040
But I mean, clearly just because the dislike is frequently used by the common people to

196
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:32,640
hashtag resist the evil corporations, it can still happen the other way around.

197
00:16:32,640 --> 00:16:37,600
I mean, big powerful groups have the incentive to do so because dislikes negatively affect

198
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:39,280
your videos in the algorithm.

199
00:16:39,280 --> 00:16:42,080
Except there's absolutely no evidence of this.

200
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:42,960
At all.

201
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:47,680
According to my YouTube analytics, my Jimmy Kimmel video received a huge spike in dislikes

202
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:49,840
on April 20th, 2018.

203
00:16:49,840 --> 00:16:52,400
Uh oh, looks like the dislike mob got to me.

204
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:55,280
Better disable my ratings before my views drop.

205
00:16:55,280 --> 00:16:56,880
Except I didn't.

206
00:16:56,880 --> 00:17:00,640
And the video still gets plenty of views, even though the proportion of dislikes has

207
00:17:00,640 --> 00:17:02,640
continued to increase over time.

208
00:17:02,640 --> 00:17:06,960
You may write this off as just circumstantial evidence, but if you ask any YouTuber out

209
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:11,920
there who isn't terrified of the dislike mob boogeyman, they'll tell you the same thing

210
00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:15,440
that dislikes have no direct effect on viewership.

211
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:21,200
The only YouTube feature that has been demonstrably proven to reduce viewership is demonetization.

212
00:17:26,960 --> 00:17:27,840
Well, whatever.

213
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:32,800
I guess you could still somehow justify disabling ratings because at least the comments give

214
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:34,000
better feedback.

215
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:38,320
Because it's not like the YouTube comment system is notorious for being a cesspool of

216
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:41,840
knuckleheads impulsively spewing their uninformed opinions.

217
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:47,360
And it's also widely understood that comments are certainly not populated by a vocal minority

218
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:52,400
of more radical viewers who will inevitably form a cult of personality around you if you

219
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:53,520
cater to them.

220
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:55,520
Are you saying my money's all gone?

221
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:59,760
But I made all the right moves, didn't I?

222
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:00,800
Oh, yes, sir.

223
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:02,000
Every move a right one.

224
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:05,440
Yep, comments are definitely a better feedback system than dislikes.

225
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:07,360
I'm really glad I disabled them.

226
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:11,680
So glad, in fact, that I believe YouTube should disable dislikes for the entire platform.

227
00:18:11,680 --> 00:18:13,120
I think it's a great idea.

228
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:15,520
And for that reason, other people should, too.

229
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:17,680
I'm so smart and correct about everything.

230
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:20,080
Just look at all these comments agreeing with me.

231
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:22,160
Man, I can picture it now.

232
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:25,680
The dislike free utopian future of YouTube.

233
00:18:25,680 --> 00:18:26,240
Wait a minute.

234
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:31,280
That's just Facebook, a site where people act like machines, corporations act like people

235
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:33,520
and machines act like CEOs.

236
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:35,760
A very utopian place indeed.

237
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:37,600
But hey, at least there's no dislikes.

238
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:42,320
And we all know that the lack of dislikes promotes great content and discussion on Facebook.

239
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:44,320
Or how about Twitter?

240
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:48,160
No dislikes to be found here without a dislike button to weaponize.

241
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:51,280
There are certainly no angry mobs wreaking havoc in this place.

242
00:18:51,920 --> 00:18:54,640
Oh, man, I'm about to contradict myself here.

243
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:58,720
But Reddit has a dislike feature and the discussion sucks here, too.

244
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:03,840
You ignorant, self-serving, killjoy, nitpicking, burger cutting bitch.

245
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:07,040
I guess that's bad news for dislikes on YouTube.

246
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:11,040
Except dislikes on YouTube don't affect the visibility of your posts.

247
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:16,960
But maybe there's a better and more fair comment system than Reddit, like this one.

248
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:19,920
Oh, wait, this is the YouTube comment system

249
00:19:19,920 --> 00:19:24,560
where dislikes have been disabled for almost five years now and it's still a cesspool.

250
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:29,360
Well, if we're talking about cesspools, let's throw in 4chan.

251
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:32,160
No dislikes here or even likes for that matter.

252
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:36,160
Surely this is the pinnacle of utopian mob free discourse.

253
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:43,200
Now tell me, does Dan Olson look like the type of guy who would prefer 4chan over Reddit?

254
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:44,080
I think not.

255
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:46,160
Am I so out of touch?

256
00:19:47,680 --> 00:19:49,680
No, it's the children who are wrong.

257
00:19:49,680 --> 00:19:50,720
Here's the thing.

258
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:54,480
People like classifying and ranking things in a hierarchy.

259
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:56,400
We do this intuitively.

260
00:19:56,400 --> 00:20:00,880
It's based on how our brains organize and categorize information.

261
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:06,240
There's a reason why WatchMojo, one of the most bland and boring channels ever,

262
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:11,840
can forge a 20 million subscriber empire from making nothing but top 10 lists.

263
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:16,160
People have a natural fascination with ranking things in some kind of order

264
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:19,120
and they do the same thing with likes and dislikes.

265
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:21,840
People want to know what's good and what's bad

266
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:25,040
and sweeping your ratings under the rug won't change that.

267
00:20:25,040 --> 00:20:27,840
Every website that doesn't have a dislike function

268
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:31,280
has users who try to supplement it through some other means.

269
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:34,160
On Facebook, you have the angry react.

270
00:20:34,160 --> 00:20:36,160
On Twitter, people get ratioed.

271
00:20:36,160 --> 00:20:38,560
On 4chan, people try to get used.

272
00:20:38,560 --> 00:20:41,280
And that brings me to the main point of this video.

273
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:45,200
Just because you can't see the dislikes doesn't mean they don't exist.

274
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:49,680
It's childish and you're starting to see this mentality everywhere.

275
00:20:49,680 --> 00:20:52,800
Oh no, people didn't like this movie with a woman in it?

276
00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:56,240
I guess it's just a dislike mob who supports the patriarchy.

277
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:59,440
Oh no, you disagree with my impeccable opinion?

278
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:01,920
I guess I have no choice but to block you,

279
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:04,720
since I can't see anyone who disagrees with me.

280
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:06,800
That must mean everyone agrees with me.

281
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:12,720
You could put half of Trump supporters into what I call the basket of deplorables.

282
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:17,200
Now having said all this, why aren't I 50 points ahead, you might ask?

283
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:20,960
I swear some people online are so averse to basic discourse

284
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:23,440
that they unlearn object permanence.

285
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:27,040
Except it's not object permanence, it's dislike permanence.

286
00:21:27,040 --> 00:21:29,600
Let's face it, you can say anything online

287
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:32,400
and a small fraction of people will hate you for it.

288
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:34,080
That much is inevitable.

289
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:36,400
As any sort of content creator online,

290
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:38,320
you will almost certainly encounter a moment

291
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:41,440
when you're faced with an unprecedented amount of backlash.

292
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:44,480
I always go back to the example of my Behind the Meme video.

293
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:48,080
Do you know how easy it would have been for me to simply write off all the criticism

294
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:50,880
as a bunch of pissed off Behind the Meme fanboys?

295
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:54,080
But I didn't do that because it simply wasn't true.

296
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:58,480
I had to swallow my pride and acknowledge that a lot of the criticism was fair

297
00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:02,240
and I used that criticism to gradually improve my approaches.

298
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:03,360
And guess what?

299
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:06,320
I don't get as many dislikes on my newer videos.

300
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:10,640
I made the dislikes go away without having to shamelessly hide them.

301
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:12,640
IT'S TIME FOR THE PILL!

302
00:22:26,160 --> 00:22:28,560
YouTubers tend to fear dislikes.

303
00:22:28,560 --> 00:22:32,880
Even though as a YouTuber, dislikes are one of your most valuable assets.

304
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:35,840
It's easy to preach to your own choir.

305
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:40,320
It's difficult to preach to strangers who have never seen you before in their lives.

306
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:43,200
YouTube is all about appealing to niche audiences.

307
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:48,160
But the more you grow, the harder it becomes to have all of your audience on the same page.

308
00:22:48,160 --> 00:22:50,400
If you're starting to see more dislikes,

309
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:54,800
well it probably just means that your channel is starting to grow outside of its comfort zone.

310
00:22:54,800 --> 00:22:55,760
And that's okay.

311
00:22:56,320 --> 00:22:59,600
Dislikes are just a natural part of growing on YouTube.

312
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:02,720
They're a sign that new people are watching your videos.

313
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:06,240
You can either accommodate the new viewers or stick to your niche.

314
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:07,440
The choice is yours.

315
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:11,920
But if you so choose to treat dislikes as a germ that must be eradicated,

316
00:23:11,920 --> 00:23:15,680
don't be surprised when eventually the new people stop showing up.

317
00:23:15,680 --> 00:23:19,280
Dislikes are one of the only lines of communication between you,

318
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:23,920
the creator, and the audience member who is discovering you for the very first time.

319
00:23:23,920 --> 00:23:29,200
Most people won't spend the effort to type up a comment or click on any link you have in the description.

320
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:33,120
But at the very least, they will press dislike on your video.

321
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:36,080
And yes, some of the critics are going to be unreasonable.

322
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:40,320
And you can never please everybody and you shouldn't try to please everybody.

323
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:43,440
But critics will give you something that your fans won't.

324
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:46,240
And that's honest, unfiltered feedback.

325
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:50,480
Truth is one of the most valuable resources no matter where you go.

326
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:52,240
From the looks of last year's Rewind,

327
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:56,800
it would seem that the YouTube community is really trying to tell YouTube the truth.

328
00:23:56,800 --> 00:23:57,600
Let's hope they listen.

329
00:23:57,600 --> 00:24:00,320
...unexpectedly broke a record with Rewind,

330
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:03,200
creating the most disliked video on the internet.

331
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:06,400
Even at home, my kids told me it was cringey.

332
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:08,320
We hear you that it didn't accurately show...

333
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:12,320
A dislike on a YouTube video has never harmed a person.

334
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:14,480
They only harm egos.

335
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:19,120
There's a reason why YouTube only suddenly decided to start talking about dislikes

336
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:21,840
after their video became the most disliked in history.

337
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:23,520
It's not a coincidence.

338
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:27,440
Dislikes make people pay attention and yank them back down to earth.

339
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:31,760
There's no bigger wake-up call as a YouTuber than seeing that ratings bar dip below 80%.

340
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:34,720
Or in YouTube's case, below 20%.

341
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:36,800
It gets to you.

342
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:37,760
You remember that.

343
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:39,840
It's a big fat slap on the wrist.

344
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:43,200
It forces you to stop and re-evaluate what you're doing.

345
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:47,280
It makes you wonder that maybe you're not as good as you think you are.

346
00:24:47,280 --> 00:24:50,560
Critics will tell you the truth and won't sugarcoat it.

347
00:24:50,560 --> 00:24:54,640
You can argue about how they're wrong all you want, but they don't think they're wrong.

348
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:58,400
And there are many people who probably agree with them and not you.

349
00:24:58,400 --> 00:24:59,600
Are they all wrong?

350
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:01,360
Or are you just out of touch?

351
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:03,520
One of these is far more likely than the other.

352
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:07,440
But once again, whichever one you want to believe is your choice.

353
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:08,480
So choose wisely.

354
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:15,680
You know, sometimes you get dislikes on YouTube videos because people meant to press like,

355
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:18,000
but they accidentally pressed the wrong button.

356
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,960
And obviously it's not that big of a deal because

357
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:23,840
at least they didn't press the wrong button on something more important.

358
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:27,680
Like, say, deciding the future of internet regulation for an entire continent.

359
00:25:28,560 --> 00:25:32,240
We interrupt this program to bring you downward spiral.

360
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:33,120
That's right, Europe.

361
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:37,600
You had elected officials literally press the wrong button while voting for some of

362
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:41,040
the most influential internet regulation in your lifetime.

363
00:25:41,040 --> 00:25:43,040
Oh, you stupid son of a-

364
00:25:43,040 --> 00:25:45,040
I'm sorry I'm not good.

365
00:25:45,680 --> 00:25:47,760
Please forgive me.

366
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:50,000
I'm just European.

367
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:53,680
If your elected officials can't even be trusted to press the right button,

368
00:25:53,680 --> 00:25:56,640
maybe it's time to take matters into your own hands.

369
00:25:56,640 --> 00:25:59,840

370

Hey everyone, Post Video Emp here.

378
00:26:29,280 --> 00:26:33,360
I just wanted to thank NordVPN again for sponsoring this video.

379
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:34,800
And my patrons.

380
00:26:34,800 --> 00:26:35,840
But most notably,

381
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:37,200
Internet Historian,

382
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:40,720
hmaxbstc811b34,

383
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:42,800
Hank Love Smith,

384
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:43,520
TheRealG,

385
00:26:44,160 --> 00:26:45,520
Sean Collins,

386
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:46,960
Jack the Whacked Out Cuck.

387
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:52,000
If you're still watching at this point after the video has ended and after the ad has ended,

388
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:53,920
then I gotta give you props.

389
00:26:53,920 --> 00:26:54,880
You have some patience.

390
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:58,080
My next video is going to come as a bit of surprise to a lot of you,

391
00:26:58,080 --> 00:27:02,240
and it's going to be very different from anything I've made over the past year and a half.

392
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:03,760
So stay tuned.

393
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:06,800
Hopefully this one won't take two months.
