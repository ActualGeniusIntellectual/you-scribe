00:00.000 --> 00:06.800
People of YouTube, it is I, everyone's favorite YouTuber Killer Keemstar and today we have some

00:06.800 --> 00:13.360
killer news, some breaking news to discuss that's definitely not two months old. Now what I'm going

00:13.360 --> 00:18.000
to talk about today is something that many of you might not even know about at all or even if you

00:18.000 --> 00:24.560
did you probably forgot about it by now but on January 29, 2019 the YouTube Creator Insider

00:24.560 --> 00:32.000
channel uploaded a video where they kind of sort of entertained the idea of possibly removing the

00:32.000 --> 00:38.000
dislike button on YouTube. Another option is just to remove dislikes entirely from YouTube. That's

00:38.000 --> 00:44.080
a very extreme option. That one seems like kind of not super democratic in my opinion. Now this

00:44.080 --> 00:48.640
is something that YouTube has foreshadowed for a while and it's something that I've been fearing

00:48.640 --> 00:54.560
happening for a long time. This is something, the prospect of YouTube removing the dislike button,

00:54.560 --> 01:00.320
this is something I've been theorizing for years. Even back when I made YouTube poops I thought of

01:00.320 --> 01:06.240
this idea back when they changed the colors of the dislikes. It used to be green and red and then

01:06.240 --> 01:11.600
all of a sudden they changed it to blue and gray. It's just blue and not a color. With the constant

01:11.600 --> 01:18.320
updates to the UI they've been minimizing the dislike bar. Now obviously in this video they

01:18.320 --> 01:23.600
don't say anything definitive. They really just kind of throw the idea out there and treat it as

01:23.600 --> 01:28.480
sort of a last resort for dealing with what they refer to as the dislike mob which we'll get into

01:28.480 --> 01:34.320
later. But I'd also like to mention that for every massively unpopular feature that nobody likes and

01:34.320 --> 01:40.000
YouTube rolls out anyway they all begin the same way with YouTube teasing it and treating it like

01:40.000 --> 01:45.520
a non-committal optional thing and then it becomes default for the whole site. And the fact of the

01:45.520 --> 01:51.600
matter is that YouTube has presented this idea on the table officially. I was always under the

01:51.600 --> 01:56.640
impression that YouTube was foreshadowing this because with seemingly every major update they

01:56.640 --> 02:02.320
make to the site's user interface the dislike bar appears less and less prominent. There have

02:02.320 --> 02:08.080
also been these bizarre cases of select videos where YouTube seems to be inexplicably removing

02:08.080 --> 02:13.920
dislikes or hiding the accurate dislike number from the public. It seems like something fishy

02:13.920 --> 02:18.640
is going on behind the scenes at YouTube and they are actively looking to either tweak or tamper

02:18.640 --> 02:23.680
with the dislike metric on the website as a whole. Now just like almost all of YouTube's major

02:23.680 --> 02:29.360
proposed changes for the site the idea of removing dislikes is very unpopular. A lot of people seem

02:29.360 --> 02:34.960
to intuitively understand that dislikes matter but I really don't think enough people realize

02:34.960 --> 02:40.400
just how important dislikes are on YouTube. But for as much as most people would like to keep

02:40.400 --> 02:45.680
dislikes around there's a certain camp that actually believes it's a good idea to remove

02:45.680 --> 02:51.280
dislikes from YouTube entirely. So in this video I'm going to do my best to explain why removing

02:51.280 --> 03:03.280
dislikes is not a great idea. But first what exactly is the argument for removing dislikes?

03:03.280 --> 03:09.200
First of all the camp who wants to remove dislikes rely heavily on this idea of a dislike mob which

03:09.200 --> 03:16.000
is terminology that's been used and validated by YouTube itself. Dislike mobs so this is where

03:16.000 --> 03:22.400
a group of people will go to a video not even watch the video and just purposely hit the thumbs

03:22.400 --> 03:27.280
down. And the fear is that by intentionally driving down the ratings of a video it will

03:27.280 --> 03:32.880
negatively affect the perceptions of the audience watching and predispose them to unfairly hate the

03:32.880 --> 03:37.760
video. Additionally they argue that dislikes negatively affect a video's performance in the

03:37.760 --> 03:43.200
algorithm and that enabling the dislike button makes it too easy for opponents to silence your

03:43.200 --> 03:50.000
videos. And finally the dislike function is binary and non-descriptive and user criticism can be

03:50.000 --> 03:55.440
easily supplemented by the comment section therefore making dislikes a redundant feature.

03:55.440 --> 04:00.320
So these are the main arguments for removing dislikes on YouTube. But before we can get into

04:00.320 --> 04:06.720
this discussion we have to first understand the role of dislikes on YouTube. You each have a knob

04:06.720 --> 04:12.000
in front of you when you like what you see turn the knob to the right when you don't like what you

04:12.000 --> 04:19.840
see turn it left. The origin of the dislike dates back to 2010 when YouTube retconned the original

04:19.840 --> 04:25.440
star rating system. It's the simplest and most accessible method that people use to determine

04:25.440 --> 04:31.120
the overall quality of a video. But how exactly do you measure whether a video is good or bad?

04:31.120 --> 04:36.720
I took a sample of 24 recommended videos on my home page. Yeah it's not a perfect sample or

04:36.720 --> 04:41.600
completely generalizable to all of YouTube but it should provide us with a decent enough estimate.

04:41.600 --> 04:48.480
So the 24 videos had a mean rating of 94% and a median rating of 96%. When you click on a YouTube

04:48.480 --> 04:54.400
video there's a good chance that at least 19 out of 20 people liked it. People tend to like YouTube

04:54.400 --> 04:59.920
videos a lot so we have to adjust our standards accordingly. So based on my personal observations

04:59.920 --> 05:05.360
from many years of watching videos on YouTube I've arranged video ratings into seven tiers.

05:05.360 --> 05:10.880
If your video has 99% likes or more you're probably looking at a pretty great video.

05:10.880 --> 05:16.960
98 to 97% is not good enough to be the best but still a good video. Most of the videos you watch

05:16.960 --> 05:23.280
on YouTube will probably fall between 96 and 94% which indicates that the video is pretty average.

05:23.280 --> 05:28.160
At 93 to 90% you're entering the territory where you start to notice that the video has an above

05:28.160 --> 05:32.800
average amount of dislikes. You'll usually see this on videos where the audience disagrees with

05:32.800 --> 05:38.240
the creator on one or two points in the video but otherwise the video is pretty average. At 89 to

05:38.240 --> 05:42.560
80% you're starting to enter controversial territory. You'll typically see this rating on

05:42.560 --> 05:47.840
videos that deal with highly opinionated hot button issues like politics or any review of

05:47.840 --> 05:53.280
The Last Jedi. If your ratings dip below 80% then there is probably something seriously wrong with

05:53.280 --> 05:58.640
your video. Either the video or audio quality is really bad or you made a big mistake in your

05:58.640 --> 06:04.240
research or if you just had a really controversial opinion. This is a stage where the quantity of

06:04.240 --> 06:09.200
dislikes is so abnormal that people actually really start paying attention to it. And finally

06:09.200 --> 06:14.320
if your video ratings drop below 50% then there isn't just something wrong with your video there's

06:14.320 --> 06:20.000
probably something wrong with you. If your ratings drop below this level then you probably said

06:20.000 --> 06:25.280
something so wrong or so out of touch that a huge part of your audience has lost respect for you.

06:25.280 --> 06:31.360
And you may have done irreparable damage to your online reputation. So that's generally how I

06:31.360 --> 06:35.680
categorize ratings on YouTube videos. It's not going to be perfect. You're going to be able to

06:35.680 --> 06:41.760
find non-examples but by and large this list is going to be fairly accurate. And you can generally

06:41.760 --> 06:47.600
use YouTube ratings to heuristically predict the nature of a video. But before we go any further

06:47.600 --> 06:52.560
I have a few more important things to explain about dislikes. First of all I see a lot of people

06:52.560 --> 06:58.080
under the impression that YouTube video ratings imply quality. That's not exactly true. You can

06:58.080 --> 07:02.720
have a very high quality video production wise but if people disagree with the core message then

07:02.720 --> 07:07.680
they're going to press dislike. More accurately ratings on YouTube represent a measure of

07:07.680 --> 07:13.280
controversiality. Second when videos are uploaded ratings tend to start high then gradually regress

07:13.280 --> 07:18.320
to the mean as the video becomes more widely circulated. Generally older videos with high

07:18.320 --> 07:22.640
view counts will have lower overall ratings because they've been exposed to a greater number

07:22.640 --> 07:28.880
of people. And finally older YouTubers with large dedicated followings tend to have better overall

07:28.880 --> 07:33.600
ratings than newer YouTubers. This is simply because the longer you watch a YouTuber the more

07:33.600 --> 07:38.560
you tend to trust them and the more likely you are to engage with their content. So naturally

07:38.560 --> 07:42.880
YouTubers that have been around for a while and have a huge core audience are going to get a lot

07:42.880 --> 07:47.840
more likes on each video as opposed to an unproven guy who nobody knows about. Therefore

07:47.840 --> 07:52.560
older YouTubers tend to get a lot more likes per video which skews their overall ratings in their

07:52.560 --> 07:58.800
favor. So if dislikes aren't an indicator of quality then what exactly is the function of

07:58.800 --> 08:10.480
dislikes on YouTube? Well at a fundamental level dislikes are a reflection of the extent to which

08:10.480 --> 08:15.680
people disagree with the core message of a video. Like I said earlier you could have the most

08:15.680 --> 08:20.800
expensive production with the slickest editing possible but if people don't like what you're

08:20.800 --> 08:25.040
saying and how you're saying it you're gonna wind up with a lot of dislikes on YouTube.

08:25.040 --> 08:30.240
I have to reiterate that dislikes are not a measure of objective quality rather it measures

08:30.240 --> 08:35.280
a difference in opinion. And with that being said it's the single most important line of

08:35.280 --> 08:40.880
communication between an audience and a creator. Your success as a creator on YouTube will almost

08:40.880 --> 08:47.760
inevitably depend on how you respond to dislikes. Now if you're someone like Dan Olson who believes

08:47.760 --> 08:52.320
that dislikes shouldn't exist on YouTube then you'd probably also be the same type of person

08:52.320 --> 08:58.720
to disable ratings on your own videos. Ah shit here we go again. Trust me when I say that this

08:58.720 --> 09:03.760
is one of the worst things you can do as a YouTuber. Seriously in all my days on this

09:03.760 --> 09:08.960
site I've never encountered a single successful and respected YouTuber who frequently disables

09:08.960 --> 09:13.920
their ratings. To understand why you have to realize why most people watch YouTube in the first

09:13.920 --> 09:19.760
place and that's to express their interests and opinions. Whether that be through their uploads,

09:19.760 --> 09:26.480
watch history, comments, and yes their ratings. When you choose to disable ratings on a video

09:26.480 --> 09:31.120
you are deliberately depriving your audience of one of their expressive outlets and you're

09:31.120 --> 09:37.040
consequently degrading their experience as a viewer. Even if they agree with you if your goal

09:37.040 --> 09:42.160
on YouTube is to not be hated by your audience then you probably shouldn't disable ratings.

09:42.160 --> 09:48.640
And yet here we see Dan Olson committing the cardinal sin. If you know anything about how

09:48.640 --> 09:54.320
YouTube works you'd have to realize that this is a boneheaded decision. I mean really anybody

09:54.320 --> 09:59.360
who expects people to support them after disabling ratings on their YouTube videos must be completely

09:59.360 --> 10:06.800
irrational. But let's assume that he is rational. Clearly something has led poor Danny boy here to

10:06.800 --> 10:11.680
intentionally degrade the experience of all his viewers. Well if you asked him he'd probably

10:11.680 --> 10:16.800
tell you that he disabled his ratings to protect himself from the nefarious dislike mobs. So let's

10:16.800 --> 10:23.600
talk about dislike mobs. You were 100% convinced that those negative reviews were part of a

10:23.600 --> 10:28.640
conspiracy. I feel like I'm in a rather privileged position to talk about this since I literally

10:28.640 --> 10:34.160
started one in 2017 when I encouraged people to go dislike the YouTube Rewind and make it the most

10:34.160 --> 10:41.360
disliked video of all time. It didn't work. Kind of. I guess it was a year too early. Now the vernacular

10:41.360 --> 10:46.400
of a dislike mob conjures up images of a torch-wielding horde of deranged maniacs who

10:46.400 --> 10:51.760
mindlessly spam dislike on whatever unfortunate video gets in their way. In reality what you may

10:51.760 --> 10:56.640
perceive as a dislike mob is almost certainly just a large group of people who simply disagreed with

10:56.640 --> 11:01.840
the fundamental message of your video. Why did the YouTube Rewind 2018 become the most disliked

11:01.840 --> 11:07.440
video of all time? Could it possibly be because a racist bigoted dislike mob conspired against the

11:07.440 --> 11:15.520
video's diversity message? No. I think we should read the comments. People dislike the Rewind

11:15.520 --> 11:20.000
because most people don't like the slick corporate brand friendly image that the site is trying to

11:20.000 --> 11:25.200
create for itself by excluding grassroots YouTubers like PewDiePie and MrBeast. People

11:25.200 --> 11:30.000
don't like being lectured about the importance of tolerating gay people by a company that has

11:30.000 --> 11:35.280
repeatedly demonstrated that they don't actually care about gay people. People don't like the idea

11:35.280 --> 11:39.760
of Hollywood celebrities, Twitch streamers, and Instagram models populating a video that is

11:39.760 --> 11:44.560
supposedly about celebrating YouTubers. Do you kind of see where I'm going with this?

11:44.560 --> 11:48.800
If your YouTube videos are getting a lot of dislikes and your initial reaction is that

11:48.800 --> 11:54.240
there's an evil mob of radicals conspiring against you, then there's probably a more

11:54.240 --> 11:59.760
reasonable explanation. Chef Ramsay had the absolute nerve to reach out to Yelpers.

11:59.760 --> 12:06.240
They are deliberately attacking my restaurant. Every Yelper lies. They hurt and damage

12:06.240 --> 12:11.440
restaurants by doing this. It is front page news across the country. As one would imagine,

12:11.440 --> 12:16.240
Mueller found collusion between President Trump, his campaign in Russia. The president obstructed

12:16.240 --> 12:20.080
justice. There will be new indictments to conservatives. If there's indictments, then

12:20.080 --> 12:24.560
clearly this has ended with Russian collusion. All indictments have been related to conspiring

12:24.560 --> 12:31.200
with Russians. It cost more than 25 million cocks and about 500 penises over 9,000 penises.

12:31.200 --> 12:36.160
There was obstruction. So, Mr. Drumpf, you admit you conspired with Russians.

12:36.720 --> 12:43.520
What do you have to say in your defense? Coincidence? I think not super democratic.

12:43.520 --> 12:48.880
Now, the Dan Olson type might counter this by saying that the dislike mob is a legitimate

12:48.880 --> 12:54.080
threat because the rating system potentially allows large and powerful groups to harass small,

12:54.080 --> 12:58.240
independent YouTubers whom they view as... Next, we're bullying me!

12:59.200 --> 13:03.200
I mean, look what happened when iDubbbz sent his army of fans to attack Leafy.

13:03.920 --> 13:09.280
Oh, wait. iDubbbz had a smaller channel at the time. But what about that time when I,

13:09.280 --> 13:13.840
the devilish butthole Emperor Lemon, sent all of my fans to go harass behind the meme?

13:14.800 --> 13:19.840
Ooh, yeah, um... Bullying!

13:19.840 --> 13:23.360
Yeah, it turns out that on YouTube, people tend to support the underdog.

13:23.360 --> 13:28.000
But I'm sure these are just two anecdotal examples that I cherry-picked, and they certainly don't

13:28.000 --> 13:33.680
reflect the true threat of dislike mobs like, oh say, the list of the most disliked YouTube

13:33.680 --> 13:38.240
videos ever. Welcome to WatchMojo.com and still be counting down number one.

13:38.240 --> 13:44.400
Coming in at number one is, once again, the 2018 YouTube Rewind, which saw an unprecedented volume

13:44.400 --> 13:48.880
of dislikes on a video. But it's clearly just a dislike mob who hates diversity.

13:48.880 --> 13:53.440
Can we also give a moment to Asian representation in entertainment this year?

13:53.440 --> 13:54.480
Number two...

13:54.480 --> 13:57.760
Number two is a music video called Baby by independent,

13:57.760 --> 14:02.080
small-time music artist Justin Bieber. Looks like the dislike mob here is just

14:02.080 --> 14:05.520
discriminating against Canadians. Number three...

14:05.520 --> 14:09.680
Number three is It's Everyday Bro by small underground YouTuber Jake Paul.

14:10.240 --> 14:15.200
Obviously, the lyrical and melodic content of this renaissance masterpiece deserves the highest

14:15.200 --> 14:19.840
of praise, and all these dislikes are just from a mob of haters whom we should dab on.

14:19.840 --> 14:22.240
Make sure you're dabbing on them haters, baby!

14:22.240 --> 14:24.400
Dab. Dab. Dab.

14:24.400 --> 14:25.600
Number four...

14:25.600 --> 14:30.400
Number four is a video from the small YouTuber PewDiePie in a video where he literally asks

14:30.400 --> 14:34.800
his fans to dislike it, but I'm sure some of those came from a mob.

14:34.880 --> 14:37.840
The racist, sexist, homophobic...

14:37.840 --> 14:38.480
Worldview.

14:38.480 --> 14:39.200
Worldview.

14:39.200 --> 14:40.000
Society.

14:40.000 --> 14:40.880
Number five...

14:43.600 --> 14:44.800
Enough is enough.

14:44.800 --> 14:46.640
Make sure you dabbing on them haters.

14:46.640 --> 14:48.560
Make sure you dabbing on them haters.

14:48.560 --> 14:49.280
Institutions.

14:49.280 --> 14:50.880
Dabbing on them haters.

14:50.880 --> 14:55.200
But what if we took the same list and ordered it by highest percentage of dislikes?

14:55.200 --> 14:59.440
Man, it's gonna take a real evil and dedicated mob to do that kind of damage.

14:59.440 --> 15:04.640
Well, organized in this order, the most disliked videos feature the targeted harassment of frail

15:04.640 --> 15:12.400
victims such as YouTube, Call of Duty, the NFL, PewDiePie, RiceGum, YouTube again, and

15:12.400 --> 15:18.960
the number one spot, coming in with over 98% dislikes, a video so hated that the creator

15:18.960 --> 15:22.160
had to issue a copyright claim against herself to take it down.

15:22.720 --> 15:28.720
It's some Brazilian celebrity who was encouraging her fans to vote against a political candidate.

15:28.720 --> 15:33.440
No matter how you slice it, the aggregate power of the dislike is used

15:33.440 --> 15:37.520
overwhelmingly against big corporate entities.

15:37.520 --> 15:42.000
Do we really want to give nuclear weapons to a man whose signature move is firing?

15:42.000 --> 15:42.480
Firing.

15:42.480 --> 15:43.680
Firing things?

15:43.680 --> 15:44.640
Yes!

15:44.640 --> 15:49.360
The true dislike mob is often just the common YouTuber pushing back against their corporate

15:49.360 --> 15:49.920
overlords.

15:50.640 --> 15:56.800
Since the very beginning of the feature, YouTubers have used the dislike as a spiritual veto

15:56.800 --> 16:02.400
against slimy manipulation by politicians and corporations, not the other way around.

16:02.960 --> 16:08.480
Now tell me, does Dan Olson look like the type of guy who wants to put more power in

16:08.480 --> 16:10.560
the hands of wealthy corporations?

16:10.560 --> 16:14.800
Well, that's exactly what would happen if he got his wish of YouTube removing dislikes.

16:14.800 --> 16:18.480
You don't need to be in the pew every Sunday to know that there's something wrong in this

16:18.480 --> 16:21.840
country when gays can serve openly in the military.

16:21.840 --> 16:27.040
But I mean, clearly just because the dislike is frequently used by the common people to

16:27.040 --> 16:32.640
hashtag resist the evil corporations, it can still happen the other way around.

16:32.640 --> 16:37.600
I mean, big powerful groups have the incentive to do so because dislikes negatively affect

16:37.600 --> 16:39.280
your videos in the algorithm.

16:39.280 --> 16:42.080
Except there's absolutely no evidence of this.

16:42.080 --> 16:42.960
At all.

16:42.960 --> 16:47.680
According to my YouTube analytics, my Jimmy Kimmel video received a huge spike in dislikes

16:47.680 --> 16:49.840
on April 20th, 2018.

16:49.840 --> 16:52.400
Uh oh, looks like the dislike mob got to me.

16:52.400 --> 16:55.280
Better disable my ratings before my views drop.

16:55.280 --> 16:56.880
Except I didn't.

16:56.880 --> 17:00.640
And the video still gets plenty of views, even though the proportion of dislikes has

17:00.640 --> 17:02.640
continued to increase over time.

17:02.640 --> 17:06.960
You may write this off as just circumstantial evidence, but if you ask any YouTuber out

17:06.960 --> 17:11.920
there who isn't terrified of the dislike mob boogeyman, they'll tell you the same thing

17:11.920 --> 17:15.440
that dislikes have no direct effect on viewership.

17:15.440 --> 17:21.200
The only YouTube feature that has been demonstrably proven to reduce viewership is demonetization.

17:26.960 --> 17:27.840
Well, whatever.

17:27.840 --> 17:32.800
I guess you could still somehow justify disabling ratings because at least the comments give

17:32.800 --> 17:34.000
better feedback.

17:34.000 --> 17:38.320
Because it's not like the YouTube comment system is notorious for being a cesspool of

17:38.320 --> 17:41.840
knuckleheads impulsively spewing their uninformed opinions.

17:41.840 --> 17:47.360
And it's also widely understood that comments are certainly not populated by a vocal minority

17:47.360 --> 17:52.400
of more radical viewers who will inevitably form a cult of personality around you if you

17:52.400 --> 17:53.520
cater to them.

17:53.520 --> 17:55.520
Are you saying my money's all gone?

17:56.400 --> 17:59.760
But I made all the right moves, didn't I?

17:59.760 --> 18:00.800
Oh, yes, sir.

18:00.800 --> 18:02.000
Every move a right one.

18:02.000 --> 18:05.440
Yep, comments are definitely a better feedback system than dislikes.

18:05.440 --> 18:07.360
I'm really glad I disabled them.

18:07.360 --> 18:11.680
So glad, in fact, that I believe YouTube should disable dislikes for the entire platform.

18:11.680 --> 18:13.120
I think it's a great idea.

18:13.120 --> 18:15.520
And for that reason, other people should, too.

18:15.520 --> 18:17.680
I'm so smart and correct about everything.

18:17.680 --> 18:20.080
Just look at all these comments agreeing with me.

18:20.080 --> 18:22.160
Man, I can picture it now.

18:22.160 --> 18:25.680
The dislike free utopian future of YouTube.

18:25.680 --> 18:26.240
Wait a minute.

18:26.240 --> 18:31.280
That's just Facebook, a site where people act like machines, corporations act like people

18:31.280 --> 18:33.520
and machines act like CEOs.

18:33.520 --> 18:35.760
A very utopian place indeed.

18:35.760 --> 18:37.600
But hey, at least there's no dislikes.

18:37.600 --> 18:42.320
And we all know that the lack of dislikes promotes great content and discussion on Facebook.

18:42.880 --> 18:44.320
Or how about Twitter?

18:44.320 --> 18:48.160
No dislikes to be found here without a dislike button to weaponize.

18:48.160 --> 18:51.280
There are certainly no angry mobs wreaking havoc in this place.

18:51.920 --> 18:54.640
Oh, man, I'm about to contradict myself here.

18:54.640 --> 18:58.720
But Reddit has a dislike feature and the discussion sucks here, too.

18:58.720 --> 19:03.840
You ignorant, self-serving, killjoy, nitpicking, burger cutting bitch.

19:04.400 --> 19:07.040
I guess that's bad news for dislikes on YouTube.

19:07.680 --> 19:11.040
Except dislikes on YouTube don't affect the visibility of your posts.

19:12.160 --> 19:16.960
But maybe there's a better and more fair comment system than Reddit, like this one.

19:16.960 --> 19:19.920
Oh, wait, this is the YouTube comment system

19:19.920 --> 19:24.560
where dislikes have been disabled for almost five years now and it's still a cesspool.

19:26.080 --> 19:29.360
Well, if we're talking about cesspools, let's throw in 4chan.

19:29.360 --> 19:32.160
No dislikes here or even likes for that matter.

19:32.160 --> 19:36.160
Surely this is the pinnacle of utopian mob free discourse.

19:36.720 --> 19:43.200
Now tell me, does Dan Olson look like the type of guy who would prefer 4chan over Reddit?

19:43.200 --> 19:44.080
I think not.

19:44.880 --> 19:46.160
Am I so out of touch?

19:47.680 --> 19:49.680
No, it's the children who are wrong.

19:49.680 --> 19:50.720
Here's the thing.

19:50.720 --> 19:54.480
People like classifying and ranking things in a hierarchy.

19:54.480 --> 19:56.400
We do this intuitively.

19:56.400 --> 20:00.880
It's based on how our brains organize and categorize information.

20:00.880 --> 20:06.240
There's a reason why WatchMojo, one of the most bland and boring channels ever,

20:06.240 --> 20:11.840
can forge a 20 million subscriber empire from making nothing but top 10 lists.

20:11.840 --> 20:16.160
People have a natural fascination with ranking things in some kind of order

20:16.160 --> 20:19.120
and they do the same thing with likes and dislikes.

20:19.120 --> 20:21.840
People want to know what's good and what's bad

20:21.840 --> 20:25.040
and sweeping your ratings under the rug won't change that.

20:25.040 --> 20:27.840
Every website that doesn't have a dislike function

20:27.840 --> 20:31.280
has users who try to supplement it through some other means.

20:31.280 --> 20:34.160
On Facebook, you have the angry react.

20:34.160 --> 20:36.160
On Twitter, people get ratioed.

20:36.160 --> 20:38.560
On 4chan, people try to get used.

20:38.560 --> 20:41.280
And that brings me to the main point of this video.

20:41.280 --> 20:45.200
Just because you can't see the dislikes doesn't mean they don't exist.

20:45.760 --> 20:49.680
It's childish and you're starting to see this mentality everywhere.

20:49.680 --> 20:52.800
Oh no, people didn't like this movie with a woman in it?

20:52.800 --> 20:56.240
I guess it's just a dislike mob who supports the patriarchy.

20:56.240 --> 20:59.440
Oh no, you disagree with my impeccable opinion?

20:59.440 --> 21:01.920
I guess I have no choice but to block you,

21:01.920 --> 21:04.720
since I can't see anyone who disagrees with me.

21:04.720 --> 21:06.800
That must mean everyone agrees with me.

21:07.360 --> 21:12.720
You could put half of Trump supporters into what I call the basket of deplorables.

21:12.800 --> 21:17.200
Now having said all this, why aren't I 50 points ahead, you might ask?

21:17.200 --> 21:20.960
I swear some people online are so averse to basic discourse

21:20.960 --> 21:23.440
that they unlearn object permanence.

21:23.440 --> 21:27.040
Except it's not object permanence, it's dislike permanence.

21:27.040 --> 21:29.600
Let's face it, you can say anything online

21:29.600 --> 21:32.400
and a small fraction of people will hate you for it.

21:32.400 --> 21:34.080
That much is inevitable.

21:34.080 --> 21:36.400
As any sort of content creator online,

21:36.400 --> 21:38.320
you will almost certainly encounter a moment

21:38.320 --> 21:41.440
when you're faced with an unprecedented amount of backlash.

21:41.440 --> 21:44.480
I always go back to the example of my Behind the Meme video.

21:44.480 --> 21:48.080
Do you know how easy it would have been for me to simply write off all the criticism

21:48.080 --> 21:50.880
as a bunch of pissed off Behind the Meme fanboys?

21:50.880 --> 21:54.080
But I didn't do that because it simply wasn't true.

21:54.080 --> 21:58.480
I had to swallow my pride and acknowledge that a lot of the criticism was fair

21:58.480 --> 22:02.240
and I used that criticism to gradually improve my approaches.

22:02.240 --> 22:03.360
And guess what?

22:03.360 --> 22:06.320
I don't get as many dislikes on my newer videos.

22:06.320 --> 22:10.640
I made the dislikes go away without having to shamelessly hide them.

22:10.720 --> 22:12.640
IT'S TIME FOR THE PILL!

22:26.160 --> 22:28.560
YouTubers tend to fear dislikes.

22:28.560 --> 22:32.880
Even though as a YouTuber, dislikes are one of your most valuable assets.

22:33.520 --> 22:35.840
It's easy to preach to your own choir.

22:35.840 --> 22:40.320
It's difficult to preach to strangers who have never seen you before in their lives.

22:40.320 --> 22:43.200
YouTube is all about appealing to niche audiences.

22:43.200 --> 22:48.160
But the more you grow, the harder it becomes to have all of your audience on the same page.

22:48.160 --> 22:50.400
If you're starting to see more dislikes,

22:50.400 --> 22:54.800
well it probably just means that your channel is starting to grow outside of its comfort zone.

22:54.800 --> 22:55.760
And that's okay.

22:56.320 --> 22:59.600
Dislikes are just a natural part of growing on YouTube.

22:59.600 --> 23:02.720
They're a sign that new people are watching your videos.

23:02.720 --> 23:06.240
You can either accommodate the new viewers or stick to your niche.

23:06.240 --> 23:07.440
The choice is yours.

23:07.440 --> 23:11.920
But if you so choose to treat dislikes as a germ that must be eradicated,

23:11.920 --> 23:15.680
don't be surprised when eventually the new people stop showing up.

23:15.680 --> 23:19.280
Dislikes are one of the only lines of communication between you,

23:19.280 --> 23:23.920
the creator, and the audience member who is discovering you for the very first time.

23:23.920 --> 23:29.200
Most people won't spend the effort to type up a comment or click on any link you have in the description.

23:29.200 --> 23:33.120
But at the very least, they will press dislike on your video.

23:33.120 --> 23:36.080
And yes, some of the critics are going to be unreasonable.

23:36.080 --> 23:40.320
And you can never please everybody and you shouldn't try to please everybody.

23:40.320 --> 23:43.440
But critics will give you something that your fans won't.

23:43.440 --> 23:46.240
And that's honest, unfiltered feedback.

23:46.880 --> 23:50.480
Truth is one of the most valuable resources no matter where you go.

23:50.480 --> 23:52.240
From the looks of last year's Rewind,

23:52.240 --> 23:56.800
it would seem that the YouTube community is really trying to tell YouTube the truth.

23:56.800 --> 23:57.600
Let's hope they listen.

23:57.600 --> 24:00.320
...unexpectedly broke a record with Rewind,

24:00.320 --> 24:03.200
creating the most disliked video on the internet.

24:03.760 --> 24:06.400
Even at home, my kids told me it was cringey.

24:06.400 --> 24:08.320
We hear you that it didn't accurately show...

24:08.320 --> 24:12.320
A dislike on a YouTube video has never harmed a person.

24:12.320 --> 24:14.480
They only harm egos.

24:14.480 --> 24:19.120
There's a reason why YouTube only suddenly decided to start talking about dislikes

24:19.120 --> 24:21.840
after their video became the most disliked in history.

24:21.840 --> 24:23.520
It's not a coincidence.

24:23.520 --> 24:27.440
Dislikes make people pay attention and yank them back down to earth.

24:27.440 --> 24:31.760
There's no bigger wake-up call as a YouTuber than seeing that ratings bar dip below 80%.

24:32.640 --> 24:34.720
Or in YouTube's case, below 20%.

24:35.600 --> 24:36.800
It gets to you.

24:36.800 --> 24:37.760
You remember that.

24:37.760 --> 24:39.840
It's a big fat slap on the wrist.

24:39.840 --> 24:43.200
It forces you to stop and re-evaluate what you're doing.

24:43.200 --> 24:47.280
It makes you wonder that maybe you're not as good as you think you are.

24:47.280 --> 24:50.560
Critics will tell you the truth and won't sugarcoat it.

24:50.560 --> 24:54.640
You can argue about how they're wrong all you want, but they don't think they're wrong.

24:54.640 --> 24:58.400
And there are many people who probably agree with them and not you.

24:58.400 --> 24:59.600
Are they all wrong?

24:59.600 --> 25:01.360
Or are you just out of touch?

25:01.360 --> 25:03.520
One of these is far more likely than the other.

25:03.520 --> 25:07.440
But once again, whichever one you want to believe is your choice.

25:07.440 --> 25:08.480
So choose wisely.

25:11.200 --> 25:15.680
You know, sometimes you get dislikes on YouTube videos because people meant to press like,

25:15.680 --> 25:18.000
but they accidentally pressed the wrong button.

25:18.000 --> 25:20.960
And obviously it's not that big of a deal because

25:20.960 --> 25:23.840
at least they didn't press the wrong button on something more important.

25:23.840 --> 25:27.680
Like, say, deciding the future of internet regulation for an entire continent.

25:28.560 --> 25:32.240
We interrupt this program to bring you downward spiral.

25:32.240 --> 25:33.120
That's right, Europe.

25:33.120 --> 25:37.600
You had elected officials literally press the wrong button while voting for some of

25:37.600 --> 25:41.040
the most influential internet regulation in your lifetime.

25:41.040 --> 25:43.040
Oh, you stupid son of a-

25:43.040 --> 25:45.040
I'm sorry I'm not good.

25:45.680 --> 25:47.760
Please forgive me.

25:47.760 --> 25:50.000
I'm just European.

25:50.000 --> 25:53.680
If your elected officials can't even be trusted to press the right button,

25:53.680 --> 25:56.640
maybe it's time to take matters into your own hands.

25:56.640 --> 25:59.840
NordVPN will not only protect your privacy,

25:59.840 --> 26:03.760
but it will also protect you from the stupidity of your world leaders.

26:03.760 --> 26:08.000
NordVPN lets you change your IP to over 50 countries around the world

26:08.000 --> 26:11.600
and over 30 countries outside of the EU's jurisdiction.

26:11.600 --> 26:15.760
Use NordVPN to anonymously launch a dislike mob against your enemies

26:15.760 --> 26:20.080
and use code EMPLEMON to get 75% off the three-year plan.

26:20.080 --> 26:25.040
Check out the link below or visit nordvpn.com slash EMPLEMON.

26:25.040 --> 26:25.440
Do it!

26:26.640 --> 26:29.280
Hey everyone, Post Video Emp here.

26:29.280 --> 26:33.360
I just wanted to thank NordVPN again for sponsoring this video.

26:33.360 --> 26:34.800
And my patrons.

26:34.800 --> 26:35.840
But most notably,

26:35.840 --> 26:37.200
Internet Historian,

26:37.200 --> 26:40.720
hmaxbstc811b34,

26:41.280 --> 26:42.800
Hank Love Smith,

26:42.800 --> 26:43.520
TheRealG,

26:44.160 --> 26:45.520
Sean Collins,

26:45.520 --> 26:46.960
Jack the Whacked Out Cuck.

26:47.600 --> 26:52.000
If you're still watching at this point after the video has ended and after the ad has ended,

26:52.000 --> 26:53.920
then I gotta give you props.

26:53.920 --> 26:54.880
You have some patience.

26:55.360 --> 26:58.080
My next video is going to come as a bit of surprise to a lot of you,

26:58.080 --> 27:02.240
and it's going to be very different from anything I've made over the past year and a half.

27:02.880 --> 27:03.760
So stay tuned.

27:04.480 --> 27:06.800
Hopefully this one won't take two months.
