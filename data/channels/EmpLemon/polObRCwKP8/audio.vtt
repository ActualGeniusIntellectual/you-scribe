WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:25.820
You've been coming in here for a while now, and we've made some progress, no doubt.

00:25.820 --> 00:29.820
But so far, we've been unable to reach a breakthrough.

00:29.820 --> 00:33.540
However, today, something's different.

00:33.540 --> 00:35.460
I can feel it.

00:35.460 --> 00:40.400
You've experienced a lot of significant change in your life, and I suspect that you're finally

00:40.400 --> 00:42.800
ready to open up.

00:42.800 --> 00:47.100
So all that said, I'm going to ask this one more time.

00:47.100 --> 00:57.420
What is the downward spiral?

00:57.420 --> 01:01.420
I was born in 1998 on a Sunday.

01:01.420 --> 01:08.780
When I look back at that year with our modern understanding of how things turned out, it

01:08.780 --> 01:12.900
can be largely seen as a pinnacle.

01:12.900 --> 01:18.720
America was by far the most feared and respected country in the world.

01:18.720 --> 01:22.780
Some of the greatest athletes in this country had the crowning achievement of their entire

01:22.780 --> 01:24.060
careers.

01:24.060 --> 01:26.400
John Elway won the Super Bowl.

01:26.400 --> 01:29.680
Dale Earnhardt won the Daytona 500.

01:29.680 --> 01:35.820
Michael Jordan captured his sixth and final NBA title.

01:35.820 --> 01:42.780
The President of the United States was still an office that was somewhat respected and

01:42.780 --> 01:44.580
revered.

01:44.580 --> 01:48.780
It's tough to look back then, knowing now how things turned out.

01:48.780 --> 01:57.460
I mean, when you look at America now, suffice to say, we've kind of fallen on hard times.

01:57.460 --> 02:04.180
In fact, when you look at just about every measurable aspect of life, it would seem that

02:04.180 --> 02:10.460
just about everything is getting steadily and steadily worse.

02:10.460 --> 02:17.580
It's almost like I came into this world right at the moment when everything started to go

02:17.580 --> 02:19.940
downward.

02:19.940 --> 02:26.320
So if you're asking me when the downward spiral began, the only thing I can say is that it

02:26.320 --> 02:32.220
had to have started sometime between then and now.

02:32.260 --> 02:37.380
The first time I saw YouTube, I was at my friend Todd's house.

02:37.380 --> 02:42.740
I remember we spent all afternoon watching stuff like Charlie the Unicorn, the Laser

02:42.740 --> 02:48.980
Collection, Clay World, all this stuff made by amateur 20-year-olds.

02:48.980 --> 02:54.460
I was still a kid at the time, and before that, I watched a lot of TV, as many people

02:54.460 --> 02:56.620
my age probably did.

02:56.620 --> 02:59.620
Cartoon Network, Nickelodeon.

02:59.620 --> 03:04.540
You pour hours and afternoons into just watching that.

03:04.540 --> 03:09.060
Even at such an early age, I could understand that the effort that went into making a TV

03:09.060 --> 03:15.420
show was something that was seemingly not replicable on just an individual scale.

03:15.420 --> 03:22.580
So when I first tuned in to YouTube and saw people making things by themselves, regular

03:22.580 --> 03:30.060
people with no skills, no prestige, no anything, they could just hop in, make some creative

03:30.060 --> 03:34.580
project and upload it for millions of people to see.

03:34.580 --> 03:36.900
That was mind-blowing to me.

03:36.900 --> 03:43.300
It was like discovering a whole new dimension, and I was hooked, man.

03:43.300 --> 03:49.100
Basically every day I'd come home from school and watch the same videos, I'd watch new videos.

03:49.620 --> 03:55.580
It was truly a brilliant time, and back then on YouTube, no one knew what they were doing.

03:55.580 --> 04:00.220
Everyone was just free to sort of make whatever they wanted.

04:00.220 --> 04:06.180
There were no formulas, there was no trying to appease some sort of algorithm.

04:06.180 --> 04:11.460
People just made stuff that they thought other people would want to see.

04:11.460 --> 04:19.300
There's a real beauty and a simplicity about that era, about people just going out there,

04:19.300 --> 04:21.300
throwing caution into the wind.

04:21.300 --> 04:28.240
But out of all the crazy stuff on this Wild West era of YouTube at the time, I was drawn

04:28.240 --> 04:33.500
into one very particular subgenre.

04:33.500 --> 04:39.740
To date it sort of goes by many names, but back then it had one name, and it was called

04:39.740 --> 04:41.380
YouTube Poop.

04:41.380 --> 04:44.420
Look what I got under me, kid!

04:44.420 --> 04:48.060
So, YouTube Poops, what are they?

04:48.060 --> 04:55.580
I feel like I had a better understanding of it when I was younger, before I developed

04:55.580 --> 04:59.240
the logical means of adult thinking.

04:59.240 --> 05:05.460
To describe YouTube Poop, the closest thing I could compare it to, I guess as a metaphor,

05:05.460 --> 05:08.860
would be digital graffiti.

05:08.860 --> 05:15.300
You're taking these pre-established works, something that's been composed by thousands

05:15.300 --> 05:20.940
of man-hours of professional production, and then you and your 12-year-old wisdom basically

05:20.940 --> 05:24.500
just turn it into a bunch of nonsense.

05:24.500 --> 05:29.860
I guess the part that drew me in is the idea that you can take this existing thing that

05:29.860 --> 05:36.900
everyone knows and transform it in a way where all of a sudden it's like a whole new thing.

05:36.940 --> 05:39.340
Something like Spongebob and Patrick cursing.

05:39.340 --> 05:42.180
There ain't nothing fancy about that word!

05:42.180 --> 05:43.180
You mean fuck?

05:43.180 --> 05:44.860
Yes, that one!

05:44.860 --> 05:52.020
It's like staring into an alternate twisted reality, but with YouTube Poops it sort of

05:52.020 --> 05:54.620
became real.

05:54.620 --> 05:59.340
It was like power, power given to the hand of a mad architect.

05:59.340 --> 06:05.740
I think sometimes it's fun for us to watch something be created, because we know how

06:05.780 --> 06:09.180
fun it may be to destroy.

06:09.180 --> 06:16.300
So in 2010 I've been browsing YouTube, sitting as the silent watcher, and I figure, hey,

06:16.300 --> 06:18.720
I might as well throw my hat in the ring.

06:18.720 --> 06:21.620
It's free, I'm a kid, I have the time.

06:21.620 --> 06:26.840
Let's try to make a YouTube Poop and upload it to a new channel.

06:26.840 --> 06:31.920
And I guess that was the beginning of Emperor Lemon.

06:31.920 --> 06:38.640
So it's March of 2010, and I'm getting ready to upload my very first YouTube Poop.

06:38.640 --> 06:43.720
It was like a four minute edit of the Spongebob episode Idiot Box.

06:43.720 --> 06:48.640
I think I worked on it for weeks, like every day coming home from school, I was obsessed

06:48.640 --> 06:49.640
with it.

06:49.640 --> 06:53.600
I was so eager, ready to just put it out to the world.

06:53.600 --> 07:00.800
So I go to click upload, post my very first video ever, and I get the notification in

07:00.800 --> 07:07.040
my video manager saying that it's been blocked worldwide for a copyright claim.

07:07.040 --> 07:11.980
Well, and that was my welcome to YouTube moment.

07:11.980 --> 07:17.520
It's interesting looking back, knowing the history of this channel, that even from the

07:17.520 --> 07:23.200
very beginning, I was having problems with YouTube.

07:23.200 --> 07:27.040
But okay, it's a rather inauspicious start.

07:27.040 --> 07:29.680
Let's try something new.

07:29.680 --> 07:34.680
And so a couple of months later, I end up posting what is the actual first video that

07:34.680 --> 07:38.240
appears on this channel.

07:38.240 --> 07:42.560
You can never have another first video or first few videos.

07:42.560 --> 07:45.080
There's something so fun about it.

07:45.080 --> 07:49.680
I kind of envy YouTubers who are just starting out.

07:49.680 --> 07:54.480
And that may sound awful rich because any YouTuber starts out as trying to get where

07:54.480 --> 07:55.480
I am.

07:56.480 --> 08:00.680
When you're starting out, there's no expectations.

08:00.680 --> 08:05.140
You don't got an audience, you could just make what you want.

08:05.140 --> 08:06.480
You don't know what you're doing.

08:06.480 --> 08:08.720
And that's great.

08:08.720 --> 08:11.560
You're not jaded over the creative process.

08:11.560 --> 08:15.440
You don't care about views or the algorithm.

08:15.440 --> 08:16.640
It's just fun.

08:16.640 --> 08:23.060
It's kind of what YouTube content is supposed to be in my opinion.

08:23.140 --> 08:25.940
So you were awfully young to be starting YouTube.

08:25.940 --> 08:31.380
Well, that's kind of why I'm glad I wound up in a place like YouTube Poop, where you

08:31.380 --> 08:34.860
could exist pretty much anonymously.

08:34.860 --> 08:40.780
It definitely helped shield me from any personal scrutiny that I certainly wasn't ready for

08:40.780 --> 08:41.780
at the time.

08:41.780 --> 08:45.340
You know, it's hard to be taken seriously as a kid online.

08:45.340 --> 08:50.660
Part of the reason I gravitated towards YTP in the first place is that it allowed me to

08:50.660 --> 08:53.020
be treated equally.

08:53.020 --> 09:01.300
Even though, if I'm being honest with myself, I probably was a little too young at the time.

09:01.300 --> 09:08.440
So my first year on YouTube, I released probably six videos.

09:08.440 --> 09:13.360
I think the most views I got on any of them over that time was like a hundred.

09:13.360 --> 09:16.720
Of course, at the time, I had no standards for anything.

09:16.720 --> 09:21.900
But I was starting to wonder whether I would make anything that would actually break on

09:21.900 --> 09:24.760
through to the next level.

09:24.760 --> 09:30.440
While approaching the one year anniversary of me opening my channel, I got my first big

09:30.440 --> 09:32.080
break.

09:32.080 --> 09:36.840
So back in the day, there was this YouTube pooper known as Barneyisperverted.

09:36.840 --> 09:43.180
He was fairly popular by YouTube Poop standards, made some pretty entertaining SpongeBob poops.

09:43.180 --> 09:49.240
And even though in 2010, my first attempt to post a SpongeBob poop was thwarted by our

09:49.240 --> 09:55.800
wonderful copyright system, by 2011, the heat had died down and I was actually able to post

09:55.800 --> 09:58.920
a SpongeBob YouTube poop on my channel.

09:58.920 --> 10:02.560
And one of these SpongeBob edits gets seen by Barney.

10:02.560 --> 10:06.320
And he posts a very nice comment saying that he loved the video.

10:06.320 --> 10:09.820
Now most YouTuber interactions would just stop there.

10:09.840 --> 10:14.880
But back then, YouTube actually had this function on the site where you could feature somebody

10:14.880 --> 10:17.480
else's video on your own channel.

10:17.480 --> 10:23.820
And out of sheer generosity, Barney put my video up on his far more popular channel.

10:23.820 --> 10:29.800
And after just 24 hours, the video had thousands of views and I crossed a hundred subscribers.

10:29.800 --> 10:36.240
Man, for me at the time, being 13 years old and having my first taste of success on YouTube,

10:36.240 --> 10:39.660
it was like Christmas had come for the second time.

10:39.680 --> 10:40.840
I was so excited.

10:40.840 --> 10:44.620
For that entire week, it was all I could think about.

10:44.620 --> 10:48.360
Going back to the video, watching the views go up and reading comments from all these

10:48.360 --> 10:51.700
people who were becoming new fans.

10:51.700 --> 10:56.260
And after a few months, that video got up to over a hundred thousand views and Emperor

10:56.260 --> 10:59.580
Lemon had officially arrived on the scene.

10:59.580 --> 11:04.200
It took pretty much a whole year to get there, but I had finally climbed that very first

11:04.200 --> 11:06.520
rung of the YouTube ladder.

11:06.520 --> 11:12.480
There was still a hell of a lot further to go, but at that point, I was very content

11:12.480 --> 11:16.000
to be standing on that rung.

11:16.000 --> 11:23.520
It's really funny the way YouTube works sometimes where these seemingly very small events can

11:23.520 --> 11:28.840
have huge consequences later on.

11:28.840 --> 11:34.120
And it's just really funny to me how this one guy who has been inactive for almost a

11:34.120 --> 11:41.880
decade now, a guy who pretty much nobody knows today, was single-handedly responsible for

11:41.880 --> 11:47.880
setting me off on my journey to however far I get.

11:47.880 --> 11:53.680
Barney may have been forgotten, but I'll never forget him.

11:53.680 --> 11:57.400
YouTube back then was pretty much the Wild West.

11:57.400 --> 12:01.320
If you got in trouble back then, there was no saving you.

12:01.320 --> 12:03.200
People could pretty much run roughshod.

12:03.200 --> 12:07.880
And if they got enough friends together to flag your videos, they could just take down

12:07.880 --> 12:12.920
your channel for no reason.

12:12.920 --> 12:15.640
And you'd have no one to review it, no way to appeal.

12:15.640 --> 12:19.960
You just have to accept it and open up a new channel.

12:19.960 --> 12:24.200
And that's how it was back then, especially in YouTube Poop where copyright was always

12:24.200 --> 12:26.880
such a lingering issue.

12:26.880 --> 12:32.200
So back in this time, I wasn't even sure if I was going to make it much longer.

12:32.200 --> 12:34.020
And it came close.

12:34.020 --> 12:40.480
My channel that you know and love today was almost terminated completely.

12:40.480 --> 12:44.600
There was a time when I had two community guidelines strikes.

12:44.600 --> 12:48.720
And of course back then, I didn't exactly have much to lose.

12:48.720 --> 12:56.760
But it's still strange to think that the channel I'm still using more than 12 years later almost

12:56.760 --> 12:59.640
ceased to exist entirely.

12:59.640 --> 13:03.960
But fortunately for me, that third strike never came.

13:03.960 --> 13:07.840
And I could live to YouTube Poop another day.

13:07.840 --> 13:11.960
And I kept making them through the rest of 2011 and 2012.

13:11.960 --> 13:14.200
I was having a good time.

13:14.200 --> 13:17.040
And people liked the videos.

13:17.040 --> 13:22.700
And then at the beginning of 2013, I started to feel something that I hadn't ever felt

13:22.700 --> 13:25.560
before while making YouTube videos.

13:25.560 --> 13:30.480
I was starting to lose motivation for working on projects.

13:30.480 --> 13:35.760
I think by the summer of 2013, I had gotten to around 3,500 subs.

13:35.760 --> 13:40.360
But the channel wasn't really growing by any substantial amount.

13:40.360 --> 13:43.860
It kind of just felt like the same old same old for a while.

13:43.860 --> 13:46.840
For me, the tank was almost empty.

13:46.840 --> 13:52.720
I could sort of feel like I wouldn't be around that much longer.

13:52.720 --> 13:56.300
So that summer, I think about trying something a little bit different.

13:56.300 --> 13:59.160
I think I worked on this video for months.

13:59.160 --> 14:04.520
It was the longest I'd ever spent on any project in my entire life.

14:04.520 --> 14:08.320
And by that August, it was done and ready to post.

14:08.320 --> 14:12.640
I didn't know it at the time, but that one video would change everything.

14:12.640 --> 14:24.720
All right, so The Uncredibles.

14:24.720 --> 14:31.140
I got to say that in my 10-plus year experience of dealing with YouTube, there's certainly

14:31.140 --> 14:33.680
a lot more heartache than anything worth celebrating.

14:33.680 --> 14:36.900
I mean, a lot of times, it's hard.

14:36.900 --> 14:38.360
It's real hard.

14:38.360 --> 14:43.120
It feels like the whole deck is stacked against you.

14:43.120 --> 14:49.460
But every now and then, you find these rare moments where YouTube throws you a bone.

14:49.460 --> 14:52.080
And man, does it feel great.

14:52.080 --> 14:56.660
I remember the video got like 50,000 views in the first week, which is something that

14:56.660 --> 15:04.000
I never came close to achieving on any of the other 30 or so videos I'd done before.

15:04.000 --> 15:08.120
And that was when I sort of knew that this video was different.

15:08.120 --> 15:12.060
And I think by around Christmas time, it hit a million, which at the time for me was

15:12.060 --> 15:15.920
just an unfathomable amount of people.

15:15.920 --> 15:18.360
I was still 15 at the time.

15:18.360 --> 15:23.780
And when you get that many views at that young, it just seems like you don't even know what

15:23.780 --> 15:25.380
to do with it.

15:25.380 --> 15:30.960
Just something about seeing that number, a million, next to something you made.

15:30.960 --> 15:37.540
It's like one of the first numbers that's so big that you can't really visualize it.

15:37.540 --> 15:44.820
It all happened so sudden, it was kind of unbelievable, surreal to see on my end.

15:44.820 --> 15:46.120
It was crazy.

15:46.120 --> 15:52.780
I didn't really know what to do other than just make more videos like it.

15:52.780 --> 15:57.680
Once YouTube gives you that shot in the arm, it's addicting.

15:57.680 --> 16:03.400
It's addicting having all these people watch something you made and they loved it and they

16:03.400 --> 16:06.140
want something more.

16:06.140 --> 16:11.300
I knew I'd made a good product and I wanted to deliver more of it.

16:11.300 --> 16:18.140
I don't know if I just got extremely fortunate or what, but in 2014, I was on a hot streak.

16:18.140 --> 16:24.340
There was a period for about 18 months from the tail end of 2013 to the beginning of 2015,

16:24.340 --> 16:28.020
where it seemed like I couldn't miss.

16:28.020 --> 16:30.300
I mean, I was riding high.

16:30.300 --> 16:31.300
How could you not be?

16:31.300 --> 16:39.120
I had this channel where I never really envisioned that I would be one of these fortunate people

16:39.120 --> 16:45.020
to be so successful and to get views consistently in the millions.

16:45.020 --> 16:51.100
But there I was, I caught the wave and I was definitely enjoying myself.

16:51.100 --> 16:56.300
Of course, that's not to say that there aren't drawbacks with growth because there certainly

16:56.300 --> 17:04.580
are and there certainly were for me, even if I didn't really realize them at the time.

17:04.580 --> 17:11.300
Getting elevated that high up on the pedestal, it's not without consequence.

17:11.300 --> 17:14.060
You know, back in the day when I was just starting out, there were a lot of YouTube

17:14.060 --> 17:18.500
poopers, many of whom I watched on a regular basis and I really enjoyed their stuff.

17:18.500 --> 17:20.060
They were friendly to me.

17:20.060 --> 17:23.940
They would comment on my stuff with words of support.

17:23.940 --> 17:32.380
But once my videos started getting a ton of views, that relationship seemed to change.

17:32.380 --> 17:38.940
There's something about the way people make YouTube poops and carry themselves where it's

17:38.940 --> 17:42.120
almost like you're not supposed to be seen.

17:42.120 --> 17:45.460
You're not supposed to be famous.

17:45.460 --> 17:50.040
It's something tied up within like the pride of the unknown artist.

17:50.040 --> 17:54.920
There was something about the nature of YouTube poops that was supposed to be anonymous.

17:54.920 --> 17:59.660
You weren't really supposed to become a personality from it.

17:59.660 --> 18:04.300
You weren't supposed to revel in the success.

18:04.300 --> 18:06.560
Was there jealousy and resentment?

18:06.560 --> 18:09.100
I mean, I guess.

18:09.100 --> 18:14.900
We all have this same sort of expectation to put in X amount of work and get so much

18:14.900 --> 18:17.680
out of it as a result.

18:17.680 --> 18:23.460
There's a lot of luck involved in YouTube and a lot of people end up far more fortunate

18:23.460 --> 18:28.680
for putting in the same work and that's just how the cookie crumbles.

18:28.680 --> 18:30.240
But yeah, people take umbrage to that.

18:30.240 --> 18:32.080
I get it.

18:32.080 --> 18:41.300
I just feel like the way that I started to be treated was a little bit unfair considering

18:41.300 --> 18:45.540
I had nothing to do with how successful my videos got.

18:45.540 --> 18:52.400
I put them up online just like any other video and they happen to do way more views.

18:52.400 --> 18:58.540
Perhaps it's my fault for not going out and making friends with these people when I should

18:58.540 --> 18:59.600
have.

18:59.600 --> 19:05.480
But once my videos started getting a lot of views, I definitely was not viewed the same

19:05.480 --> 19:06.640
way.

19:06.640 --> 19:11.700
You see this happen to a lot of artists in any creative field where they get a big break

19:11.700 --> 19:16.180
and then all of a sudden people start coming out of the woodwork talking about how they

19:16.180 --> 19:17.980
don't deserve it.

19:17.980 --> 19:25.320
And for as much as the casual audience loved those videos, they certainly started to rub

19:25.320 --> 19:29.460
people the wrong way in my neck of the woods.

19:29.460 --> 19:32.700
I don't believe that I acted arrogantly.

19:32.700 --> 19:35.700
I don't believe that I acted prideful.

19:35.700 --> 19:41.340
That's how it may have been perceived by people back then, but that wasn't what I was putting

19:41.340 --> 19:42.920
out.

19:42.920 --> 19:45.120
I tried to share the success.

19:45.120 --> 19:49.440
A lot of people forget this, but I hosted collabs.

19:49.440 --> 19:55.940
I really tried to get a lot more talented people in the community seen.

19:55.940 --> 19:59.540
I wanted to be generous, you know?

19:59.540 --> 20:06.660
But it seems like no matter how much stuff I did to try to elevate other people, it wasn't

20:06.660 --> 20:10.660
necessarily appreciated.

20:10.660 --> 20:14.500
So you had a lot of success at a time where not many others did.

20:14.500 --> 20:20.580
Do you ever experience regret that maybe you should have capitalized on it more?

20:20.580 --> 20:24.180
I mean, that's how a lot of YouTubers would have treated it.

20:24.180 --> 20:29.540
Many people on this website have found great success by taking the Machiavellian approach,

20:29.540 --> 20:33.540
just sort of treating their audience as another means to an end.

20:33.540 --> 20:38.540
Back then I could have definitely cashed in on something trendy like MLG montage parodies,

20:38.540 --> 20:42.900
and who knows how my career could have turned out and just how big my audience could have

20:42.900 --> 20:44.680
been today.

20:44.680 --> 20:50.140
In hindsight, it's easy to envision yourself making all the right choices, so much so that

20:50.140 --> 20:54.900
we often lose sight of how we could have made the wrong ones.

20:54.900 --> 21:00.340
Something tells me that if I had sold out way back then, things probably wouldn't have

21:00.340 --> 21:02.040
worked out for me.

21:02.040 --> 21:05.300
I don't think I was ready to take that next step.

21:05.300 --> 21:12.740
I was still way too young, and I didn't appreciate what it was like to truly struggle.

21:12.740 --> 21:18.180
So at the end of 2014, I started off on what was probably my biggest project ever at that

21:18.180 --> 21:22.180
point, which was the Frying Nemo series.

21:22.180 --> 21:28.180
It basically took me six months to release these four YouTube poops covering the entire

21:28.180 --> 21:30.860
runtime of Finding Nemo.

21:30.860 --> 21:36.020
And for what I could realistically achieve at the time, it was ambitious.

21:36.020 --> 21:38.900
I worked really, really hard on it.

21:38.900 --> 21:43.820
It was the hardest I worked on any project to that point.

21:43.820 --> 21:48.500
Somewhere along the way, I really was not having fun.

21:48.500 --> 21:55.180
It was probably the first time making any YouTube poop where I was not really enjoying

21:55.180 --> 21:56.620
the ride.

21:56.620 --> 22:03.840
It was pretty much the first hint I got that my time in YouTube poop was starting to come

22:03.840 --> 22:05.900
to a close.

22:05.900 --> 22:11.500
I think somewhere along the way, it became less about what I want to make and more about

22:11.500 --> 22:15.700
what I think the fans are going to enjoy watching.

22:15.700 --> 22:21.760
And many YouTubers can attest to this, but doing that is kind of the one way to suck

22:21.760 --> 22:24.820
the enjoyment out of whatever you're working on.

22:24.820 --> 22:29.900
And to make matters worse, the reception to the end of the series wasn't really what

22:29.900 --> 22:31.960
I'd been hoping for.

22:31.960 --> 22:40.620
So a lot of the YouTube poop community, they like to reside on this forum known as YouTube.

22:40.620 --> 22:46.740
I uploaded Deep Frying Nemo, which was part four, the final part of the Frying Nemo series.

22:46.740 --> 22:53.140
And on the general discussion page, it was just a fucking page and a half of people ridiculing

22:53.140 --> 22:54.640
the video.

22:54.640 --> 23:01.000
It was hard to see all these people, many of which I looked up to and respected.

23:01.000 --> 23:05.520
Just being so bitter about me uploading this video.

23:05.520 --> 23:10.440
That moment for me was sort of like, I'm an outsider in this community.

23:10.440 --> 23:15.080
I'm not really well liked anymore.

23:15.080 --> 23:20.840
I may have been liked at one point, but I never capitalized on it enough to sort of

23:20.840 --> 23:22.780
sustain that goodwill.

23:22.820 --> 23:30.860
And now it seems like a lot of people in this community no longer hold me in good esteem.

23:30.860 --> 23:31.860
And it was tough.

23:31.860 --> 23:38.340
It was tough to be motivated to continue after that, knowing that your contemporaries, the

23:38.340 --> 23:45.900
people you relate to most in making this very niche style of video, they don't really like

23:45.900 --> 23:47.360
you.

23:47.360 --> 23:54.120
I think that summer, the summer of 2015, I really started to consider stepping away from

23:54.120 --> 23:56.040
YouTube Poop.

23:56.040 --> 24:00.000
That summer, actually, I passed a pretty huge milestone.

24:00.000 --> 24:03.400
I passed 100,000 subscribers.

24:03.400 --> 24:10.300
I think only two, maybe three other people had ever gotten that far from a channel uploading

24:10.300 --> 24:12.760
exclusively YouTube Poops.

24:12.760 --> 24:18.440
Within that genre, there were really no more barriers left to overcome.

24:18.440 --> 24:20.280
I'd done everything.

24:20.280 --> 24:28.040
I don't know if I exactly knew it at the time, but ready or not, it was time for me to sort

24:28.040 --> 24:32.880
of turn over the next page in my career.

24:32.880 --> 24:37.800
So this is my 100,000 subscriber play button that I got back in 2015.

24:37.840 --> 24:43.080
A lot of YouTubers today don't even know that they used to look like this, but I definitely

24:43.080 --> 24:45.980
like the old design a lot better.

24:45.980 --> 24:48.720
It felt a lot more personal and special.

24:48.720 --> 24:54.740
I guess you could say that's how the whole site was back then.

24:54.740 --> 25:00.880
But as luck would have it, passing 100K was only the second most fortunate thing to happen

25:00.880 --> 25:02.640
to me that year.

25:02.640 --> 25:07.560
Because at around the same time, I got a little message in my YouTube dashboard saying that

25:07.560 --> 25:11.220
I'd been approved for monetization.

25:11.220 --> 25:16.560
This was something for me that didn't even seem like it should have been on the table.

25:16.560 --> 25:20.960
And it would absolutely never happen today.

25:20.960 --> 25:25.320
During this whole time so far and getting all those millions and millions of views,

25:25.320 --> 25:30.460
I had never actually earned a cent of revenue for myself.

25:30.460 --> 25:34.860
It was all complimentary for the fans, you know.

25:34.860 --> 25:40.040
My motivation with YouTube at the time was never about making money.

25:40.040 --> 25:45.560
And based on the type of videos I was making, it wasn't something you could do regardless.

25:45.560 --> 25:53.220
And it really never occurred to me until that moment that YouTube could actually be a viable

25:53.220 --> 25:54.940
career choice.

25:54.940 --> 25:59.020
It's just really funny because every couple of years or so when I was starting to lose

25:59.020 --> 26:05.140
motivation, YouTube would just throw me a bone to keep me in the game.

26:05.140 --> 26:10.680
And here was another one, just YouTube offering me free money on a silver platter.

26:10.680 --> 26:13.660
It's pretty crazy how it happened that way.

26:13.660 --> 26:18.740
Looking back, I feel like I just had to be in the perfect place at the perfect time for

26:18.740 --> 26:21.360
the stars to align in that way.

26:21.360 --> 26:24.340
But what do you know?

26:24.340 --> 26:26.900
YouTube works in mysterious ways.

26:26.900 --> 26:31.560
And all of a sudden, I had a whole new purpose for making videos.

26:31.560 --> 26:38.460
I had a lot of new priorities, initiatives that I wanted to try out with my channel.

26:38.460 --> 26:43.660
But I just wasn't quite ready to take that step.

26:43.660 --> 26:48.920
For the moment, I actually went back to making YouTube poops, sort of like how I used to

26:48.920 --> 26:52.060
make them right when I started.

26:52.060 --> 26:57.760
I mean, I stopped caring so much about what the final product would be, and I just sort

26:57.760 --> 27:01.220
of put a video together and put it out.

27:01.220 --> 27:07.020
I think mentally, I just tried to go back, back to a time when all this stuff was just

27:07.020 --> 27:13.780
still intrinsically fun for me, where the act of making the video in and of itself was

27:13.780 --> 27:16.060
where the value came from.

27:16.060 --> 27:23.300
But of course, at this stage in my career, it couldn't possibly go back to exactly how

27:23.300 --> 27:25.060
it was.

27:25.060 --> 27:33.140
And YouTube viewers, 95% of the time, all they really want is one type of thing done

27:33.140 --> 27:35.300
one sort of way.

27:35.300 --> 27:40.660
And my viewers at the time wanted an eight and a half minute YouTube poop about a Pixar

27:40.660 --> 27:41.660
movie.

27:41.660 --> 27:45.180
And when I stopped delivering, they stopped tuning in.

27:45.300 --> 27:51.660
So as I started releasing these new, more experimental YouTube poops, the views started

27:51.660 --> 27:54.940
dwindling downward.

27:54.940 --> 28:00.140
The thing about success on YouTube is that it's oftentimes fragile.

28:00.140 --> 28:04.780
One year you can feel like you're just on top of the world, but anyone who's been in

28:04.780 --> 28:11.300
the game long enough will tell you that it can all go away like that.

28:11.340 --> 28:16.740
I'm not one of these people whose self-worth is intrinsically tied to how many people are

28:16.740 --> 28:18.380
watching them on the internet.

28:18.380 --> 28:22.740
It really didn't make that much of a difference to me.

28:22.740 --> 28:29.900
What did start to bother me at that point was the comment section.

28:29.900 --> 28:31.780
It started off with just a few.

28:31.780 --> 28:35.680
Go to any comment section on YouTube and you'll find them.

28:35.680 --> 28:40.580
But as time went on and I kept putting out these videos that most of the audience didn't

28:40.580 --> 28:46.220
care for, that vocal minority started to grow a lot.

28:46.220 --> 28:49.740
And you know, I was someone who was perceptive to it.

28:49.740 --> 28:53.700
I used to read every single comment I got.

28:53.700 --> 29:01.460
Every day, every time I'd log into YouTube, I'd go to the comments tab and read them all.

29:01.460 --> 29:03.180
I don't do it anymore.

29:03.180 --> 29:08.820
It's just, it's just too much mentally to deal with.

29:08.820 --> 29:13.980
Especially once the audience grew to a point where it was just thousands and thousands

29:13.980 --> 29:17.140
of people sharing their opinions.

29:17.140 --> 29:25.440
I don't think that the human mind was designed to deal with this many people talking to you.

29:25.440 --> 29:27.900
But back then, I stuck through it.

29:27.900 --> 29:31.700
That was like the lifeline to me with the audience.

29:31.700 --> 29:37.900
I find prestige in entertaining an audience of people.

29:37.900 --> 29:44.220
And the comment section, that's the primary means of communication for expressing whether

29:44.220 --> 29:47.620
or not a viewer was entertained.

29:47.620 --> 29:48.740
So it meant a lot to me.

29:48.740 --> 29:51.820
It meant more than the views and the money.

29:51.820 --> 29:54.340
Numbers, they're just numbers.

29:54.340 --> 29:56.180
You can count them all day.

29:56.180 --> 30:00.260
But it's the human element of the comment section.

30:00.260 --> 30:04.140
That is the sauce that really ties everything together.

30:04.140 --> 30:11.500
But for as much as I extol the meaningfulness of reading the comments, sometimes you encounter

30:11.500 --> 30:15.900
those moments when it's just an absolute bitch.

30:15.900 --> 30:22.100
I think the final turning point for me was when I decided to make The Simpsons green.

30:22.100 --> 30:24.940
I really liked working on this video.

30:24.940 --> 30:29.620
I considered it one of the best videos I'd made in over a year.

30:29.620 --> 30:35.700
This video for me epitomized everything about why I was inspired to make these videos in

30:35.700 --> 30:37.260
the first place.

30:37.260 --> 30:38.260
It may seem stupid.

30:38.260 --> 30:46.980
It may seem very dumb to get sentimental over videos as ultimately stupid as YouTube poops

30:46.980 --> 30:47.980
are.

30:47.980 --> 30:50.140
But at this point, it was 2016.

30:50.140 --> 30:56.380
It was almost six years of my life, thousands of hours of my free time dedicated to making

30:56.380 --> 30:58.020
these videos.

30:58.020 --> 31:02.940
And sure, everyone else may call it stupid, but these videos and the process of making

31:02.940 --> 31:05.980
them were meaningful to me.

31:05.980 --> 31:09.740
Green Simpsons was meaningful to me.

31:09.740 --> 31:15.340
But that day, the comment section didn't agree.

31:15.340 --> 31:26.780
God, after a while, it's just like, can you people just get off my damn back?

31:26.820 --> 31:28.940
Jesus Christ, man.

31:28.940 --> 31:30.980
I make these videos for fun.

31:30.980 --> 31:36.300
I put these videos out for years for all of you to enjoy for free.

31:36.300 --> 31:41.420
And then I make one or two that you don't like and all of a sudden it's this big problem

31:41.420 --> 31:46.420
and you have to make it my problem.

31:46.420 --> 31:50.740
I just complain after complain after complain.

31:50.740 --> 31:52.340
And it wasn't all of them.

31:52.340 --> 31:55.860
It wasn't even a majority of them.

31:55.860 --> 32:04.540
But it was a level of bitching unlike anything I had ever personally experienced before.

32:04.540 --> 32:08.180
I mean, making YouTube poops is all about fun.

32:08.180 --> 32:10.380
It's supposed to be fun.

32:10.380 --> 32:15.900
Well, I wasn't having fun anymore.

32:15.900 --> 32:19.380
You know, I really tried.

32:19.380 --> 32:25.440
I really tried to just kind of graciously ride off into the sunset.

32:25.440 --> 32:32.200
But the circumstances were such where that wasn't going to happen.

32:32.200 --> 32:33.880
I took it hard.

32:33.880 --> 32:35.680
I took it really hard.

32:35.680 --> 32:38.280
I was very upset.

32:38.280 --> 32:45.560
I had never been this upset before making YouTube videos.

32:45.560 --> 32:48.280
I just couldn't believe what I was seeing.

32:48.280 --> 32:55.680
These people who had just enjoyed this content I made for years that I put out for free to

32:55.680 --> 32:58.560
just turn on me like that.

32:58.560 --> 33:06.120
It really just threw a wrench into my whole philosophy of where I derive enjoyment from

33:06.120 --> 33:07.760
making videos.

33:07.760 --> 33:10.840
I used to think it was all about the fans.

33:10.840 --> 33:13.120
All about pleasing them.

33:13.120 --> 33:20.400
Not only were they displeased, but now I had become displeased.

33:20.400 --> 33:28.120
And again, I apologize if I'm being overly corny or sentimental by saying this, but back

33:28.120 --> 33:36.420
then YouTube poop and making YouTube videos, that was one of the only things that I really

33:36.420 --> 33:37.420
liked doing.

33:37.900 --> 33:43.900
It was one of the only things that I considered myself good at.

33:43.900 --> 33:47.580
It was as big a part of my life as anything else.

33:47.580 --> 33:52.180
And my oh so beloved audience took it away from me.

33:52.180 --> 33:56.860
They made it so that I couldn't enjoy it anymore.

33:56.860 --> 34:01.540
And upon realizing that, something in me changed.

34:01.540 --> 34:10.980
And that right there was the moment that Emperor Lemon died and was replaced by Emplemon.

34:10.980 --> 34:15.020
I'm sensing a lot of anger from this time period.

34:15.020 --> 34:17.140
Yeah.

34:17.140 --> 34:19.980
And how did that make you feel?

34:19.980 --> 34:21.780
Angry.

34:21.780 --> 34:28.300
God, people are always wondering when exactly the downward spiral began.

34:28.300 --> 34:33.220
I think that this moment right here is a pretty good candidate for when.

34:33.220 --> 34:39.220
I mean the whole story before this, you could pick and choose times when you think I'm in

34:39.220 --> 34:41.420
the downward spiral.

34:41.420 --> 34:47.140
But after this happened, I am without question in the downward spiral.

34:47.140 --> 34:54.460
I think it was six years to the day of when I first opened my YouTube channel when I uploaded

34:54.460 --> 34:57.000
the We Need to Talk video.

34:57.000 --> 35:02.380
With that being said, I have a lot of stuff I really need to get off of my chest.

35:02.380 --> 35:08.600
The way I see it, these people had bitched and moaned and complained and ruined my day.

35:08.600 --> 35:11.560
And now it was my turn.

35:11.560 --> 35:18.400
I don't need people to boss me around about fucking YouTube poops where the entire fucking

35:18.400 --> 35:21.680
purpose is to get away from that bullshit.

35:21.680 --> 35:22.680
I'll show you complaining.

35:22.680 --> 35:27.200
I'll show you the best complaining that anyone has ever seen.

35:27.200 --> 35:31.240
I will make an entire career out of complaining.

35:31.240 --> 35:35.840
If you're one of these people with the fucking delusion to think that I will listen to your

35:35.840 --> 35:39.560
hackneyed demands, you need to unsubscribe from this channel right now.

35:39.560 --> 35:43.960
I don't want you subscribed.

35:43.960 --> 35:50.600
You know, they say you shouldn't do this in all the little YouTube advice tutorial videos

35:50.600 --> 35:59.640
that you find from some Indian guy who hasn't even managed to crack 10,000 subscribers.

35:59.640 --> 36:07.080
It's not part of the pre-composed YouTube tips to make an entire video snapping on your

36:07.080 --> 36:10.360
audience and telling them how much you hate them.

36:10.360 --> 36:14.080
Oh, I'm sorry, is it not fun enough for you?

36:14.080 --> 36:15.320
Too bad.

36:15.320 --> 36:19.120
I stopped having fun a long time ago.

36:19.120 --> 36:22.360
Send me the crap below 100,000 again.

36:22.360 --> 36:25.880
At least it would remind me of a time when the shit was still fun.

36:25.880 --> 36:33.240
YouTube, whatever it is at this point, is clearly not about having fun anymore.

36:33.240 --> 36:36.640
That day, I made it very, very clear.

36:36.640 --> 36:42.100
I'm not going to be pushed around by the whims of this audience anymore.

36:42.100 --> 36:48.560
Any video you see on the future of this channel, it won't be because of you.

36:48.560 --> 36:52.520
It won't be for you.

36:52.520 --> 36:58.440
It was a mistake to care so much about them.

36:58.440 --> 37:02.040
I never really have since.

37:02.040 --> 37:04.220
People unsubbed.

37:04.220 --> 37:06.680
People stopped watching.

37:06.680 --> 37:07.880
Views went down.

37:07.880 --> 37:10.340
Revenue went down.

37:10.340 --> 37:12.880
I didn't care.

37:12.880 --> 37:16.560
I'd been happy making videos for no viewers.

37:16.560 --> 37:21.080
I'd been happy making videos for no money.

37:21.080 --> 37:27.320
You had people coming out saying that I was done, that I would never amount to anything,

37:27.320 --> 37:32.900
that I'd bow out of YouTube and quit, and they'd dance on my grave for having the audacity

37:32.900 --> 37:37.920
to lash out against the oh-so-prestigious audience.

37:37.920 --> 37:38.960
And you know what?

37:38.960 --> 37:43.400
It was probably very reasonable for them to believe that.

37:43.440 --> 37:50.840
People didn't do what I just did, but that was the road I traveled.

37:50.840 --> 37:53.760
It was time to stick with it.

37:53.760 --> 37:58.260
The summer of 2016, I made all sorts of videos.

37:58.260 --> 38:03.160
It was the most varied my content had been and probably ever will be.

38:03.160 --> 38:08.360
I'd been wanting to branch out and try new videos for a while, but it was this moment

38:08.360 --> 38:13.800
in rejecting the fans that truly pushed me into it.

38:13.800 --> 38:17.000
Because as for the channel, I hit the reset button.

38:17.000 --> 38:21.640
I pretty much took the old channel, burnt it to the ground, and built a new one out

38:21.640 --> 38:23.360
of the ashes.

38:23.360 --> 38:27.360
The views at one point got very lean.

38:27.360 --> 38:34.040
There was a period where I'd upload a video and it would only get 10,000 views.

38:34.040 --> 38:40.480
Pretty much a 99% decline, 99 out of 100 people had stopped watching me.

38:40.480 --> 38:47.600
There would be entire months during that summer when I had negative subscriber growth.

38:47.600 --> 38:52.320
Pretty much every video I'd upload, I would lose subscribers.

38:52.320 --> 38:57.200
Not very healthy-looking metrics for a growing channel.

38:57.200 --> 38:58.420
But you know what?

38:58.420 --> 39:00.340
I didn't care.

39:00.340 --> 39:05.760
For the first time in what felt like forever, I actually had the freedom to work on what

39:05.760 --> 39:08.260
I wanted to make.

39:08.260 --> 39:14.800
In confronting this taboo of not trying to screw with the audience, I ended up overcoming

39:14.800 --> 39:17.700
this fear of losing them.

39:17.700 --> 39:19.580
It was a mutual departure.

39:19.580 --> 39:22.780
I didn't need them and they didn't need me.

39:22.780 --> 39:27.380
It's just the reality of making content online.

39:27.380 --> 39:29.960
People come and people go.

39:29.960 --> 39:37.540
It was a strange time to be an M.Plemon fan, but those few people who stuck around, well,

39:37.540 --> 39:41.140
they were in for quite a ride.

39:41.140 --> 39:46.660
So 2016 was a pretty tumultuous year for me, personally.

39:46.660 --> 39:52.340
I'd have to say that if I look back at every single year in my life, that was probably

39:52.340 --> 39:57.260
the one year in which I had the most personal change.

39:57.260 --> 40:02.380
But hey, you know, just because I'm on a downward spiral, it doesn't mean everything

40:02.380 --> 40:04.340
else has to be.

40:04.340 --> 40:10.500
And if there was one saving grace of 2016, it was that there was all of a sudden plenty

40:10.500 --> 40:22.620
of great stuff to watch on YouTube.

40:22.620 --> 40:30.580
To this day, I always maintain that 2016 was the best year for YouTube content.

40:30.580 --> 40:35.340
Basically in this year, you saw people become legends.

40:35.340 --> 40:45.040
Filthy Frank, iDubbbz, Keemstar, Leafy, even H3H3 at this point was making good videos.

40:45.040 --> 40:52.600
I see posts in the modern age, trying to write off this era as being just unnecessarily

40:52.600 --> 41:01.720
edgy or trying too hard or having a detrimental influence on whatever future generation you

41:01.720 --> 41:03.680
may consider.

41:03.680 --> 41:08.440
These guys deserved the success they achieved.

41:08.440 --> 41:16.820
They pushed the boundaries harder than any other group of YouTubers before or since.

41:16.820 --> 41:21.720
The content produced during this time was just simply at another level.

41:21.720 --> 41:28.820
It may seem sappy to talk about it this way, to be so reverent over what was essentially

41:28.820 --> 41:34.040
just a bunch of guys goofing around and starting drama with each other.

41:34.040 --> 41:40.480
But you'd be hard pressed to find another period of YouTube history that was more interesting

41:40.480 --> 41:41.480
and more dynamic.

41:41.480 --> 41:49.160
It was just a time when people were just so free and unafraid to push the needle.

41:49.160 --> 41:55.040
In hindsight, knowing what was coming next, we probably should have been a little bit

41:55.040 --> 41:56.820
more afraid.

41:56.820 --> 42:00.900
These guys were truly influential and they influenced me.

42:00.900 --> 42:05.220
I got to see what was possible on YouTube.

42:05.220 --> 42:11.060
And towards the end of 2016, I was finally starting to get a little bit of momentum back

42:11.060 --> 42:12.060
on my side.

42:12.060 --> 42:17.340
I remember at the end of the year, I came out with the empty subscribers video and then

42:17.340 --> 42:20.980
the top 10 dank memes of 2016.

42:20.980 --> 42:27.580
And these were pretty much the first proto M.Plemon videos of the modern age, where I

42:27.580 --> 42:34.500
actually sat down, wrote a script, recorded, and edited a complete product.

42:34.500 --> 42:39.340
I remember at the end of 2016, I hit a very big personal milestone.

42:39.340 --> 42:44.940
I had my first $1,000 month on YouTube.

42:44.940 --> 42:51.300
And it gave me a slight glimmer of hope that I could continue this into the future.

42:51.300 --> 42:56.180
You know, after all this strife and all this turmoil, the channel wasn't dead yet.

42:56.180 --> 42:58.940
There's still a little bit of life left in it.

42:58.940 --> 43:04.580
There were still new people tuning in, new growth to be had.

43:04.580 --> 43:09.340
It was basically a new channel with a new audience and a new direction, but things were

43:09.340 --> 43:10.500
looking up.

43:10.500 --> 43:13.820
It seemed like it was going to get easier.

43:13.820 --> 43:19.360
Little did I know just how foolish it was to place that much faith in YouTube.

43:19.360 --> 43:24.260
Just when they pull you back in, it seems like every single thing conspires against

43:24.260 --> 43:26.500
you to push you out.

43:26.500 --> 43:34.620
God, man, 2017, what an awful year to be on YouTube.

43:34.620 --> 43:35.620
It had to have been the worst.

43:35.620 --> 43:41.140
It had to have been the worst year in YouTube history.

43:41.140 --> 43:46.700
I know there's a lot of new people in the YouTube space who weren't around back then,

43:46.700 --> 43:56.040
but if you ask people who were, people like me, they will get legitimate PTSD flashbacks

43:56.040 --> 44:02.500
at how putrid of a year that was to make content on YouTube.

44:02.500 --> 44:08.540
It all started from just some article from some douchebag journalist whose name doesn't

44:08.540 --> 44:10.540
even deserve to be mentioned.

44:10.540 --> 44:12.420
He's just complete garbage.

44:12.420 --> 44:16.140
He writes this whole article for the Wall Street Journal about how he found some Coca-Cola

44:16.140 --> 44:19.300
ads on a Johnny Rebel song.

44:19.300 --> 44:25.260
Never you mind the fact that the Titanic music companies that basically almost tried to bully

44:25.260 --> 44:31.380
YouTube out of existence in the first place, they manually claim and run ads on all these

44:31.380 --> 44:32.460
songs.

44:32.460 --> 44:34.820
That's the reason there's ads on it.

44:34.820 --> 44:37.420
Didn't show up to the guy in the article for some reason.

44:37.420 --> 44:40.860
No, it's YouTube's fault.

44:40.860 --> 44:49.140
And Coca-Cola and PepsiCo, they can't be bothered to have their product alongside such raucous,

44:49.140 --> 44:50.820
inappropriate content.

44:50.820 --> 44:52.380
Oh no.

44:52.380 --> 44:58.940
So that marked the opportunity for basically them and a lot of other Fortune 500 companies

44:58.940 --> 45:02.940
to pull their ads out of YouTube entirely.

45:02.940 --> 45:09.220
So you know how I had my first thousand dollar month in the December of 2016 or so.

45:09.220 --> 45:15.340
I think by March, my monthly earnings for the entire channel was under a hundred.

45:15.340 --> 45:20.900
I was basically making enough money off of my channel in those months to go to the grocery

45:20.900 --> 45:23.340
store two times.

45:23.340 --> 45:26.080
Thanks for the tens of thousands of views.

45:26.080 --> 45:27.980
This is what you're worth now.

45:27.980 --> 45:34.840
And this is what every YouTuber was worth now that didn't make squeaky clean, brand

45:34.840 --> 45:36.580
friendly content.

45:37.060 --> 45:42.060
Man, hearing all that makes me glad I chose a profession in psychiatric help.

45:42.060 --> 45:47.540
Seems like every passing year, business just keeps going up.

45:47.540 --> 45:54.860
Just old, dying dinosaur media who no longer have the interest to have pissed away all

45:54.860 --> 45:57.820
the goodwill of the audience they once had.

45:57.820 --> 46:04.200
It's their lone, dying clutches to maintain the last scrap of relevancy they could.

46:04.200 --> 46:09.960
They saw all the audiences turning off the TV, cutting the cable cord and going to YouTube

46:09.960 --> 46:13.280
to enjoy better content for free.

46:13.280 --> 46:15.800
And they weren't willing to go down without a fight.

46:15.800 --> 46:21.440
These companies, they had their chance to come into YouTube graciously, but they did

46:21.440 --> 46:22.840
not choose to do so.

46:22.840 --> 46:29.420
And I will always have a chip on my shoulder against them because of how they acted coming

46:29.420 --> 46:30.420
in here.

46:30.420 --> 46:33.960
YouTubers, man, I mean, we built this platform.

46:33.960 --> 46:41.360
We worked for free for years, making content for people that was more compelling, more

46:41.360 --> 46:47.580
interesting and more personal than anything you guys were putting out.

46:47.580 --> 46:54.000
It could have come in graciously, but no, they wanted to come in and call the shots.

46:54.000 --> 46:59.000
The YouTube trending tab, pretty much a joke now, but there was a time when you could actually

46:59.000 --> 47:04.040
find decent and interesting stuff to watch on there from YouTubers.

47:04.040 --> 47:10.260
Oh, but then Jimmy Kimmel and Jimmy Fallon and all the late night hosts decide we want

47:10.260 --> 47:17.780
our stuff to not only compete in the same space with YouTubers, but we want to be given

47:17.780 --> 47:19.520
special treatment.

47:19.520 --> 47:26.920
I say it started happening probably around 2015, but it didn't really get obnoxious until

47:26.920 --> 47:29.080
2017.

47:29.080 --> 47:36.580
Late night TV show clips, you had to get them all in, all represented, big budget mainstream

47:36.580 --> 47:43.140
movie trailers, big budget mainstream music videos from top 40 artists.

47:43.140 --> 47:48.600
This was the content that was now the face of YouTube, or at least they were trying to

47:48.600 --> 47:50.400
make it that way.

47:50.400 --> 47:56.380
And of course, when the adpocalypse hits and all the actual homegrown native YouTubers

47:56.380 --> 48:03.840
get absolutely slaughtered, all these companies just slide in, make themselves comfortable.

48:03.840 --> 48:06.200
Of course, their ad rates never took a hit.

48:06.200 --> 48:11.480
It was only us, the common man, the common YouTuber, the whole reason that motivates

48:11.480 --> 48:17.460
you to get up and make content because it's achievable for us.

48:17.460 --> 48:23.880
It's never achievable for you to become Jimmy Kimmel or for you to become a top 40 artist

48:23.880 --> 48:27.720
with million dollar budget music videos.

48:27.720 --> 48:29.380
That's the appeal of YouTube.

48:29.380 --> 48:35.580
The idea that we, the common man, are making the content and we don't have to rely on million

48:35.580 --> 48:39.460
dollar venture capitalist industry shills.

48:39.460 --> 48:44.780
We don't need to rely on the whim of some old crotchety 80 year old producer who thinks

48:44.780 --> 48:48.400
he knows what young people want to watch.

48:48.400 --> 48:52.780
These companies, when given the chance early on, they tried to kill YouTube.

48:52.780 --> 48:58.260
They tried to squash YouTube into the dust and keep the glass ceiling in place.

48:58.260 --> 49:04.460
Keep that division between the regular plebs who should never amount to anything and the

49:04.460 --> 49:10.220
golden boys, the mainstream Hollywood, New York City elite.

49:10.220 --> 49:12.160
It wasn't a long time ago.

49:12.160 --> 49:18.780
It was just 10, 15 years ago when all this stuff was going down and how easy it is for

49:18.780 --> 49:21.280
YouTube to forget.

49:21.280 --> 49:26.000
Because at the same time that all this homegrown talent that basically built the platform were

49:26.000 --> 49:32.200
getting squashed, YouTube basically saw the legacy media that had antagonized us for so

49:32.200 --> 49:38.980
long and laid down and said, you guys come on in, make yourselves comfortable.

49:38.980 --> 49:44.440
We have no allegiance and no accountability to the very people who built this site.

49:44.440 --> 49:50.560
We were basically used to build throne rooms for all these established companies to just

49:50.560 --> 49:56.600
come in and sit down on top of us without having to earn a thing.

49:56.600 --> 50:01.280
All you mainstream companies who tried to choke us out just a decade ago, you are now

50:01.280 --> 50:04.520
the premier face of the entire website.

50:04.520 --> 50:06.880
Welcome in.

50:06.880 --> 50:10.880
We hope you enjoy your stay.

50:10.880 --> 50:18.520
Maybe they did, but for the rest of us, we sure weren't enjoying our time on YouTube.

50:18.520 --> 50:22.500
I can't speak for everyone else, but I was sure pissed.

50:22.500 --> 50:26.040
I was pissed off at the direction of this website.

50:26.040 --> 50:32.280
I felt like there was no longer a premium for making good videos.

50:32.280 --> 50:37.520
It seemed like for a little bit there, YouTube was not just neglecting it, but actively making

50:37.520 --> 50:43.140
the site inhospitable for interesting and dynamic content.

50:43.140 --> 50:49.220
And for me, the abject downfall in the quality of YouTube content came to be embodied by

50:49.220 --> 50:50.820
one channel.

50:50.820 --> 50:53.900
It was a channel by the name of Behind The Meme.

50:53.900 --> 50:58.340
Hello internet and welcome to Behind The Meme, where we take a look at the meaning and the

50:58.340 --> 51:00.700
origin of your favorite memes.

51:00.700 --> 51:07.760
And God, he got a ton of views and his videos were complete shit.

51:07.760 --> 51:15.880
It was just awful, terrible, just complete dog shit content, bland, boring, no insight,

51:15.880 --> 51:19.400
just like brainless popcorn content.

51:19.400 --> 51:21.160
But man, people tuned in.

51:21.160 --> 51:24.500
I don't know why they did, but they did.

51:24.500 --> 51:25.720
He was on trending.

51:25.720 --> 51:31.320
He was getting pushed by the algorithm in everyone's homepage and I could tolerate it

51:31.320 --> 51:35.920
for so long until he made a video about YouTube poop.

51:35.920 --> 51:42.560
It was one of my most hated videos of all time in my 10 plus years of watching videos

51:42.560 --> 51:44.400
on this platform.

51:44.400 --> 51:47.220
Just pump out the video for the hell of it.

51:47.220 --> 51:53.440
And who the hell cares if you're representing whatever you're talking about correctly or

51:53.440 --> 51:55.840
even remotely, informatively?

51:55.840 --> 51:58.480
No, no, no.

51:58.480 --> 52:02.880
That's just the standard on YouTube that's being promoted at this point.

52:02.880 --> 52:08.600
Pump out a bunch of complete shit content and all the stupid idiot viewers will just

52:08.600 --> 52:10.440
lick up the slop.

52:10.440 --> 52:11.520
And I had had enough of it.

52:11.520 --> 52:15.800
I had had enough of seeing the direction of the site.

52:15.800 --> 52:22.640
So I basically took years of rage and inflicted it on this one guy.

52:22.640 --> 52:29.120
And that was the behind the meme video.

52:29.120 --> 52:34.800
About 2016 and much of 2017, it was a big trend on YouTube to start drama.

52:34.800 --> 52:37.480
Call someone out and air your beef.

52:37.480 --> 52:39.560
Some would call it toxic.

52:39.560 --> 52:41.280
Yeah.

52:41.280 --> 52:45.200
There's always been toxic content on YouTube.

52:45.200 --> 52:51.580
I would call it keeping people honest and accountable and making sure that the overall

52:51.580 --> 52:57.440
quality of content on this site doesn't devolve into absolute dog water.

52:57.440 --> 53:04.120
This behind the meme guy, people were already sick of him long before I touched the topic.

53:04.120 --> 53:05.120
But Hey, you know what?

53:05.120 --> 53:09.640
I saw all these people making these call out videos to great success.

53:09.640 --> 53:13.680
Now it was my turn to become the content cop.

53:13.680 --> 53:19.120
And man, to say that it's my most controversial video would be an understatement.

53:19.120 --> 53:26.100
There are people today, five years after the fact who still refuse to watch anything I

53:26.100 --> 53:34.260
make because of what they saw me say in that video, there were a lot of people pissed off

53:34.260 --> 53:40.060
at what I was saying, but you know, after having my whole audience turn on me in 2016,

53:40.060 --> 53:41.840
I was used to it.

53:41.840 --> 53:43.340
It didn't really phase me.

53:43.340 --> 53:45.700
And you know, they had their reasons.

53:45.700 --> 53:50.340
The criticism I got from that video was not unwarranted.

53:50.340 --> 53:56.140
There's a lot of stuff said in that video that was pushing the limits of acceptability.

53:56.140 --> 54:00.300
Do I regret releasing the behind the meme video?

54:00.300 --> 54:05.500
Well, I can say it was definitely a lot more trouble than it was worth.

54:05.500 --> 54:07.980
I did gain quite a few new fans from that.

54:07.980 --> 54:13.100
It was probably my first million view video since the YouTube Poop era.

54:13.100 --> 54:16.940
It was kind of like opening a Pandora's box of sorts.

54:16.980 --> 54:22.620
I had never made a video before that going so hard after one individual channel.

54:22.620 --> 54:28.140
And I didn't really anticipate my audience who had been mostly indifferent with anything

54:28.140 --> 54:30.820
I'd made for the past year and a half.

54:30.820 --> 54:37.440
I wasn't really expecting them to be so emboldened with what I was saying and to really go after

54:37.440 --> 54:43.940
this guy and just hammer him for weeks and months after the fact.

54:43.940 --> 54:47.760
It caused a lot of heartache, a lot of strife, a lot of anger.

54:47.760 --> 54:49.980
But do I regret putting it out?

54:49.980 --> 54:50.980
I don't really know.

54:50.980 --> 54:56.920
I think to say I regretted it would be like to say that whole part of my development on

54:56.920 --> 54:59.340
YouTube didn't matter.

54:59.340 --> 55:02.140
I could try to play it off as much as I want.

55:02.140 --> 55:08.900
But at the end of the day, I know deep down that I meant what I said in that video.

55:08.900 --> 55:15.060
In my mindset and my mental state at that time and my anger towards the direction of

55:15.060 --> 55:20.460
this website, that video wasn't going to turn out any other way.

55:20.460 --> 55:23.520
It was a product of its time, no doubt.

55:23.520 --> 55:28.680
If I could do it over knowing what I know today, then yeah, I probably would have done

55:28.680 --> 55:31.620
things a bit differently in that video.

55:31.620 --> 55:37.860
That video, whether you like it or not, that was simply the next stepping stone in my development.

55:37.860 --> 55:43.200
And I wouldn't be in the position I am today had it not been for the mistakes I learned

55:43.200 --> 55:44.200
from that video.

55:44.200 --> 55:53.860
But you know, I made my drama video and I had a tension that I had not had since 2014 or 2015.

55:53.860 --> 55:59.320
After releasing that video, I definitely turned over a new chapter of the downward spiral.

55:59.320 --> 56:04.220
You know, I complained and bitched and been abrasive and cantankerous for many videos

56:04.220 --> 56:05.940
before that.

56:05.940 --> 56:09.940
But this was the first one where people actually listened.

56:09.940 --> 56:15.840
It was definitely something I had not experienced up until that point in my career.

56:15.840 --> 56:21.060
You know, whether they were for or against the video, people were paying attention.

56:21.060 --> 56:25.540
People were listening and people were taking it seriously.

56:25.540 --> 56:30.900
It was the first time I'd released something out onto the internet and really made people

56:30.900 --> 56:32.520
pay attention.

56:32.520 --> 56:38.600
It's easy to just watch content online and be aloof and indifferent towards all of it.

56:38.600 --> 56:41.560
But this video made people angry.

56:41.560 --> 56:46.540
Whether they were angry at me or angry at behind the meme, they cared.

56:46.540 --> 56:53.120
It certainly made an impression on me to basically take all these people and rile them up.

56:53.120 --> 56:58.380
It was power and agency that I suddenly had in my hands.

56:58.380 --> 57:04.020
And over the course of the next year, I was definitely experimenting to see how far I

57:04.020 --> 57:06.660
could push it.

57:06.660 --> 57:11.880
Don't you think that it's a little hypocritical to complain about being badgered by your audience

57:11.880 --> 57:15.420
just to turn around and do the very same thing to Behind the Meme?

57:15.420 --> 57:18.220
Well, let's not mince words here, alright?

57:18.220 --> 57:20.740
The content was piss poor.

57:20.740 --> 57:22.140
There's no getting around it.

57:22.140 --> 57:24.660
And yours wasn't?

57:24.660 --> 57:30.140
I guess the difference for me is that I was trying to make good videos.

57:30.140 --> 57:33.420
I never got the impression that he was.

57:33.420 --> 57:39.680
You know, there's very little separating his stuff from something like BuzzFeed or WatchMojo.

57:39.680 --> 57:42.920
Just a bland, soulless content farm.

57:42.920 --> 57:47.020
I don't want to hear this revisionist history about how his videos were actually decent

57:47.020 --> 57:48.920
because they weren't.

57:48.920 --> 57:53.340
Just because you feel sorry for the guy doesn't change that.

57:53.380 --> 57:55.300
Did Behind the Meme deserve to be criticized?

57:55.300 --> 57:58.300
Absolutely.

57:58.300 --> 58:04.780
But I'll acknowledge that at some points, perhaps the criticism went a little too far.

58:04.780 --> 58:10.740
Well, don't you feel at least a little sympathy for the role that you played in it?

58:10.740 --> 58:14.300
You know, the way some people retell it, it was like I literally sent people out there

58:14.300 --> 58:15.940
to go harass the guy.

58:15.940 --> 58:17.060
Let's set the record straight.

58:17.060 --> 58:18.780
That never happened.

58:18.780 --> 58:21.580
That was never my intent.

58:21.580 --> 58:22.860
Did the hate go too far?

58:22.860 --> 58:23.860
Yes.

58:23.860 --> 58:24.860
Okay, yeah, I think so.

58:24.860 --> 58:26.140
I'll admit it.

58:26.140 --> 58:29.620
And after a while, I did start to feel bad for the guy.

58:29.620 --> 58:34.940
It's part of the reason why I've since tried to distance my content from YouTube drama.

58:34.940 --> 58:38.220
Because after a certain point, it's just not worth it.

58:38.220 --> 58:41.860
It just becomes too exhausting.

58:41.860 --> 58:43.260
And I get it, you know.

58:43.260 --> 58:45.340
There's enough problems in the world.

58:45.340 --> 58:48.420
Why create another one?

58:48.420 --> 58:52.820
At the time, that was the video I wanted to make.

58:52.820 --> 59:00.220
But it wouldn't be long before I would start holding myself to a higher standard.

59:00.220 --> 59:06.580
I think at this point, it's important to reiterate that I still wasn't planning to do YouTube

59:06.580 --> 59:08.140
full time.

59:08.140 --> 59:12.960
There was maybe a brief moment six months earlier when I was considering it.

59:12.960 --> 59:19.540
But in the middle of 2017, YouTube was basically on the verge of financial ruin for the vast

59:19.540 --> 59:22.140
majority of its creators.

59:22.140 --> 59:26.900
And it didn't exactly look promising for the future.

59:26.900 --> 59:28.540
It was a really rough time.

59:28.540 --> 59:35.140
Probably the worst time in the past 10 years to try to earn a living off of YouTube.

59:35.140 --> 59:40.220
I'm not exactly the type of person you'd consider to be a strategic optimist.

59:40.220 --> 59:44.020
I'm not someone who sits around hoping that things magically get better.

59:44.020 --> 59:49.620
No, the way I do things, I'm always really perceptive of the realities of how things

59:49.620 --> 59:52.240
are in the current moment.

59:52.240 --> 59:56.420
And in that moment, YouTube did not look like the way to go.

59:56.420 --> 01:00:01.900
I'd resolved within myself that I would use the supplemental income that YouTube provided.

01:00:01.900 --> 01:00:06.580
But that there would come a point in the near future where I would have to abandon YouTube

01:00:06.580 --> 01:00:10.580
and enter the workforce and get a conventional job.

01:00:10.580 --> 01:00:16.740
And the whole point of mentioning this is to reiterate that even as recently as 2017,

01:00:16.740 --> 01:00:22.660
I was still not fully committed to putting YouTube in my future.

01:00:22.660 --> 01:00:26.600
And that definitely affected how I ran the channel at the time.

01:00:26.600 --> 01:00:29.780
Because quite simply, I wasn't building for the future.

01:00:29.780 --> 01:00:32.820
I didn't see my future on YouTube.

01:00:32.820 --> 01:00:38.300
And there were moments back then where I was basically planning to flame out and just squeeze

01:00:38.300 --> 01:00:42.940
as much goodwill and attention out of this channel that I possibly could have before

01:00:42.940 --> 01:00:47.300
I inevitably crashed it into the ground.

01:00:47.300 --> 01:00:54.940
I remember that summer of 2017, the state of the website just continued to deteriorate.

01:00:54.940 --> 01:00:59.900
The infamous demonetization system was starting to get rolled out.

01:00:59.900 --> 01:01:02.820
And it was pushed out long before it was ready.

01:01:02.820 --> 01:01:05.340
And it was just a total mess.

01:01:05.340 --> 01:01:11.220
It was a time when you couldn't even touch a sensitive topic without your video turning

01:01:11.220 --> 01:01:17.880
yellow and your potential revenue being slashed 60-70%.

01:01:17.880 --> 01:01:18.880
It was awful.

01:01:18.880 --> 01:01:20.460
It was just paralyzing.

01:01:20.460 --> 01:01:22.060
You couldn't do anything.

01:01:22.060 --> 01:01:28.040
You couldn't take the slightest risk without being in just financial ruin.

01:01:28.040 --> 01:01:32.560
So much effort being spent on videos that was just all for naught.

01:01:32.560 --> 01:01:37.860
And when they demonetized your video, they wouldn't just take away your revenue.

01:01:37.860 --> 01:01:40.220
And they tried to deny this for the longest time.

01:01:40.220 --> 01:01:45.820
But after enough experience from everybody, it was just indisputable.

01:01:45.820 --> 01:01:50.900
You would not only get less revenue, you would get less views and less exposure.

01:01:50.900 --> 01:01:57.780
And after enough people saw how their videos did while monetized versus demonetized.

01:01:57.780 --> 01:02:00.140
It was a night and day difference.

01:02:00.140 --> 01:02:06.260
YouTube tried to pretend that it wasn't there, but everyone caught on.

01:02:06.260 --> 01:02:08.380
There was no hiding it.

01:02:08.380 --> 01:02:14.800
And there was a lot of adaptation that was forced on by these monumental changes.

01:02:14.800 --> 01:02:19.380
Content as a whole was forced to be less interesting and less inspiring.

01:02:19.380 --> 01:02:26.140
It's just like everything got forced into this bottleneck of being bland, safe, and

01:02:26.140 --> 01:02:30.300
just totally unwilling to step on anyone's toes.

01:02:30.300 --> 01:02:35.680
I'd be damned if I wasn't just dismayed seeing every day on this website people neutering

01:02:35.680 --> 01:02:38.760
their content to adhere to their guidelines.

01:02:38.760 --> 01:02:44.600
And I had initially placed my frustrations on a guy like Behind The Meme.

01:02:44.600 --> 01:02:50.560
I took all this frustration of YouTube basically burning down in front of my eyes and pinned

01:02:50.560 --> 01:02:52.880
it on one guy.

01:02:52.880 --> 01:02:58.180
And it didn't take long for me to see how that was a little unfair.

01:02:58.180 --> 01:03:03.480
And how my anger and resentment should have been placed somewhere else.

01:03:03.480 --> 01:03:07.760
And so I shifted my focus to YouTube.

01:03:07.760 --> 01:03:13.520
Some may have called it awfully arrogant of me to do so, biting the hand that feeds.

01:03:13.520 --> 01:03:20.120
People pointed out how it was awfully hypocritical of me to direct all this hate towards YouTube.

01:03:20.120 --> 01:03:25.200
I wouldn't have cared so much if deep down I didn't love YouTube.

01:03:25.200 --> 01:03:27.760
And that was really the honest fact of the matter.

01:03:27.760 --> 01:03:30.260
I loved YouTube.

01:03:30.260 --> 01:03:35.720
And I saw this thing I loved probably more than anything else in my life gradually just

01:03:35.720 --> 01:03:39.400
decay into a shell of its former self.

01:03:39.400 --> 01:03:42.180
And it was extremely disheartening to me.

01:03:42.180 --> 01:03:46.780
So I released the video, YouTube has been on a downward spiral.

01:03:46.780 --> 01:03:51.380
And pretty much everything in there just comes straight from the heart.

01:03:51.380 --> 01:03:58.780
You know I never had any intentions to damage YouTube or to cause the site to fail at my

01:03:58.780 --> 01:04:00.420
hands.

01:04:00.420 --> 01:04:05.380
For me it was just a means of saying like, what are we doing?

01:04:05.380 --> 01:04:11.700
What have we done with this place that was once so beautiful and robust and just a sanctuary

01:04:11.700 --> 01:04:19.300
for independent creators to make these low budget creative works and express themselves.

01:04:19.300 --> 01:04:21.300
This is what YouTube was all about.

01:04:21.300 --> 01:04:25.820
You could broadcast yourself and then look what we've become.

01:04:25.820 --> 01:04:28.220
I had a lot of pain for sure.

01:04:28.220 --> 01:04:34.580
And it was almost like I wanted to make everyone else feel as upset and betrayed as I was.

01:04:34.580 --> 01:04:39.020
And for a lot of people, yeah, that video was very upsetting, but I think a lot of other

01:04:39.020 --> 01:04:45.500
people felt vindicated that someone was finally stepping up and speaking their mind on a lot

01:04:45.500 --> 01:04:51.540
of these issues that they were thinking but were perhaps too timid to bring to light.

01:04:51.540 --> 01:04:56.820
And it was all of a sudden with this video where I felt like I had a greater purpose.

01:04:56.820 --> 01:05:01.400
Where it was no longer about hedonistically and selfishly just putting videos out there

01:05:01.400 --> 01:05:05.180
and getting views and revenue for myself.

01:05:05.180 --> 01:05:11.560
I felt like I was now speaking on behalf of the greater YouTube community.

01:05:11.560 --> 01:05:14.460
And you know I wore that as a badge of honor.

01:05:14.460 --> 01:05:20.800
You could call it virtue signaling or grandstanding or whatever, but I really felt good being

01:05:20.800 --> 01:05:22.360
in that role.

01:05:22.360 --> 01:05:27.340
Being sort of the mouthpiece for all these other misfortunate creators who got sacrificed

01:05:27.340 --> 01:05:28.700
for the system.

01:05:28.700 --> 01:05:35.220
For a moment I just really reveled in being the guy to speak the honest truth of the situation

01:05:35.220 --> 01:05:39.100
and not worry about what would happen to my channel.

01:05:39.100 --> 01:05:44.600
And I was ready at that point to basically ride off into the sunset until YouTube kicked

01:05:44.600 --> 01:05:45.600
me off.

01:05:45.600 --> 01:05:46.600
I didn't care.

01:05:46.600 --> 01:05:49.940
I was dealing with something that was bigger than me.

01:05:49.940 --> 01:05:54.200
And yeah, maybe it was arrogant of me and maybe there were points when I was in over

01:05:54.200 --> 01:05:55.200
my head.

01:05:55.200 --> 01:05:59.760
But it was definitely a fire that was lit underneath me that was making me more motivated

01:05:59.760 --> 01:06:02.760
than at any time that I could remember.

01:06:02.760 --> 01:06:08.000
So towards the end of the year, I start really trying hard on these videos.

01:06:08.000 --> 01:06:13.300
I really start putting a lot of effort into the editing and the writing and the pacing.

01:06:13.300 --> 01:06:16.980
Trying to basically make the best product that I could make.

01:06:16.980 --> 01:06:22.300
I pretty much wanted to prove to everyone else and myself that I could.

01:06:22.300 --> 01:06:27.220
That my videos could be in the same league as the best of the best on this website.

01:06:27.220 --> 01:06:31.900
And so I started working on what was probably my most ambitious project to date.

01:06:31.900 --> 01:06:36.220
The video that would eventually become the Donald Trump meme theory.

01:06:36.220 --> 01:06:42.040
And looking back, this was probably the very first video that I would consider to be in

01:06:42.040 --> 01:06:45.220
the modern M.Plemon era.

01:06:45.220 --> 01:06:50.820
I remember this was the first written video where I finished it and was able to look back

01:06:50.820 --> 01:06:53.180
on it with some kind of pride.

01:06:53.180 --> 01:06:55.520
And I always remember what happened next.

01:06:55.520 --> 01:06:59.660
I remember I posted it and it was up for about a day.

01:06:59.660 --> 01:07:06.300
And then, within probably a few hours, it got demonetized and copyright claimed.

01:07:06.300 --> 01:07:09.620
And I was completely discouraged.

01:07:09.620 --> 01:07:13.660
And for me, for a while, that was pretty much the final straw.

01:07:13.660 --> 01:07:20.860
I mean, I had this video that was like the first video that I was really and truly proud of.

01:07:20.860 --> 01:07:26.540
And I do all this work just to put it up there and basically get the ultimate middle finger from YouTube.

01:07:26.540 --> 01:07:29.860
You can put in all this effort and people can watch and like it.

01:07:29.860 --> 01:07:34.940
But at the end of the day, your kind is basically not welcome here.

01:07:34.940 --> 01:07:40.160
And me continuing to try to give the site a chance and give it the benefit of the doubt,

01:07:40.160 --> 01:07:42.220
I was done.

01:07:42.220 --> 01:07:46.520
I was not going to tolerate this disrespect anymore.

01:07:46.520 --> 01:07:50.140
And I was ready to just straight up quit right there.

01:07:50.140 --> 01:07:54.640
I typed up what was basically a resignation letter from YouTube.

01:07:54.640 --> 01:08:00.800
And I was ready to put it up as just one last final fuck you to my YouTube career.

01:08:00.800 --> 01:08:05.040
And I fully believe I would have gone through with it and just quit that day.

01:08:05.040 --> 01:08:12.000
But you know, this strange thing about YouTube, throughout my entire career, just when I was

01:08:12.000 --> 01:08:17.600
ready to leave every time, something pulled me back in.

01:08:17.600 --> 01:08:22.060
So I had appealed the copyright claim and I'd appealed the demonetization.

01:08:22.060 --> 01:08:24.740
And thus far, I didn't have very good luck with it.

01:08:24.740 --> 01:08:30.220
But lo and behold, right as I was about to go put together this video of me quitting,

01:08:30.220 --> 01:08:36.140
I refreshed the video manager to see the green dollar sign looking at me again.

01:08:36.140 --> 01:08:41.780
And man, that was one of the most surreal moments I've ever had on this website.

01:08:41.780 --> 01:08:47.620
It was almost like a moment of divine intervention, where I'd been taken to the absolute darkest

01:08:47.620 --> 01:08:50.540
place I'd ever been on YouTube.

01:08:50.540 --> 01:08:55.380
And one tiny glimmer of light came through.

01:08:55.380 --> 01:08:56.860
And I took it as a sign.

01:08:56.860 --> 01:09:01.540
I took it as a sign to say that my time here isn't up just yet.

01:09:01.540 --> 01:09:05.200
I have a little bit more business to attend to.

01:09:05.200 --> 01:09:10.820
Two weeks after that moment, YouTube announces YouTube Rewind for 2017.

01:09:10.820 --> 01:09:14.900
And something about that just really didn't sit right with me.

01:09:15.260 --> 01:09:22.180
I mean, for a year as punishing as 2017 was to just most of the talent on the website,

01:09:22.180 --> 01:09:28.100
how tone deaf do you have to be to put on this whole glamorous end of the year celebration?

01:09:28.100 --> 01:09:32.760
As if all the strife and struggle you put your users through during the entire year

01:09:32.760 --> 01:09:34.600
just didn't matter.

01:09:34.600 --> 01:09:37.180
Like you were just sweeping it all under the rug.

01:09:37.180 --> 01:09:43.100
So I come up with this little document, basically saying how YouTube has screwed over and mistreated

01:09:43.100 --> 01:09:45.740
its creators for the entire year.

01:09:45.740 --> 01:09:51.740
And how we as YouTubers should basically protest all of this mistreatment by going to YouTube

01:09:51.740 --> 01:09:54.180
Rewind and pressing dislike.

01:09:54.180 --> 01:09:57.940
And YouTube Rewind starts getting a lot of dislikes.

01:09:57.940 --> 01:10:03.700
It was getting to a point where it was like a top 50, top 25 most disliked video in history.

01:10:03.700 --> 01:10:08.580
I don't really know how much of it I can personally take credit for.

01:10:08.580 --> 01:10:10.980
But one thing was definitely for sure.

01:10:10.980 --> 01:10:15.400
And it was that I was not alone in being pissed off at YouTube.

01:10:15.400 --> 01:10:18.020
And YouTube, of course, caught wind of it.

01:10:18.020 --> 01:10:22.740
They saw that YouTube Rewind was getting an abnormal amount of dislikes.

01:10:22.740 --> 01:10:29.280
And they saw that a lot of it could be traced back to me, a guy who had made a post instigating

01:10:29.280 --> 01:10:30.800
people to do so.

01:10:30.800 --> 01:10:35.880
I never got any official word that this was the case, of course.

01:10:35.880 --> 01:10:39.660
But by this point, I had lots of friends in the community.

01:10:39.660 --> 01:10:45.100
When I heard some stuff through the grapevine, they singled me out as the guy who had led

01:10:45.100 --> 01:10:47.700
the campaign against YouTube Rewind.

01:10:47.700 --> 01:10:52.260
And I don't think it's overtly paranoid for me to say that for the next year or so on

01:10:52.260 --> 01:10:56.000
the website, I definitely felt like a target.

01:10:56.000 --> 01:11:00.100
I definitely felt like YouTube was putting the screws to me.

01:11:00.100 --> 01:11:04.740
There would be times when I'd upload a video and there'd be absolutely nothing wrong with

01:11:04.740 --> 01:11:05.740
it.

01:11:05.740 --> 01:11:08.380
And it would still get demonetized.

01:11:08.380 --> 01:11:13.900
You could show that video to a hundred people and none of them would find anything objectionable

01:11:13.900 --> 01:11:15.040
in it.

01:11:15.040 --> 01:11:19.620
But I put it up and within a minute, it would be demonetized.

01:11:19.620 --> 01:11:22.100
You guys want to make it this difficult, fine.

01:11:22.100 --> 01:11:24.100
I'll play ball.

01:11:24.100 --> 01:11:26.340
I'm not afraid to be a martyr.

01:11:26.340 --> 01:11:27.560
I'll follow the rules.

01:11:27.560 --> 01:11:34.600
I'll follow all the guidelines you need just to prove that you guys are screwing with me.

01:11:34.600 --> 01:11:39.000
So this was actually the point in the channel where I started making my more professional

01:11:39.000 --> 01:11:41.000
looking series.

01:11:41.000 --> 01:11:45.540
Series that I intentionally designed to be a bit more polished and a bit more accessible

01:11:45.540 --> 01:11:47.480
for general audiences.

01:11:47.480 --> 01:11:52.640
It was basically just me proving to YouTube that I was capable of acting as professionally

01:11:52.640 --> 01:11:54.200
as anyone else.

01:11:54.200 --> 01:11:59.260
And that all these problems they were giving me were simply out of their own prerogative.

01:11:59.260 --> 01:12:05.120
And I swear to this day that for a while there, something was definitely up.

01:12:05.120 --> 01:12:10.800
My channel was definitely on some kind of list, but you know, by this point around the

01:12:10.800 --> 01:12:18.260
summer of 2018, I kind of been on my anti YouTube war path for a year and a half now.

01:12:18.260 --> 01:12:23.080
And it was fun for a little bit to keep up this persona of Mr. Rant.

01:12:23.080 --> 01:12:27.660
But after a while, you just start to run out of gas.

01:12:27.660 --> 01:12:32.920
Sometimes people have made very long and lucrative careers out of being the guy who complains

01:12:32.920 --> 01:12:35.100
about whatever topic.

01:12:35.100 --> 01:12:37.260
And I don't have anything against it.

01:12:37.260 --> 01:12:38.760
More power to them.

01:12:38.760 --> 01:12:41.460
It's not easy to consistently succeed on YouTube.

01:12:41.460 --> 01:12:46.500
And if you can find a formula to do so, then that's good for you.

01:12:46.500 --> 01:12:52.560
But after being the bitchy complaint guy for so long, I started to realize that I just

01:12:52.560 --> 01:12:54.920
can't keep this up forever.

01:12:55.100 --> 01:13:01.200
And just being angry and disgruntled all the time, surprise, surprise, it wasn't making

01:13:01.200 --> 01:13:02.200
me happy.

01:13:02.200 --> 01:13:05.720
I mean, YouTube at that point still wasn't getting any better.

01:13:05.720 --> 01:13:10.600
So it's not like all these complaints were actually amounting to anything.

01:13:10.600 --> 01:13:14.960
You know, in the moment, it feels real good to get all these people riled up based on

01:13:14.960 --> 01:13:21.640
something you say, and to basically create this army of people to go out and raise hell.

01:13:21.640 --> 01:13:26.640
But after a while, it feels like you just run out of things to complain about.

01:13:26.640 --> 01:13:31.860
And so I thought to myself, instead of wasting all this time and effort and resources complaining

01:13:31.860 --> 01:13:37.360
about how much YouTube sucks now, wouldn't it be nice if instead you could just be a

01:13:37.360 --> 01:13:41.520
reason why YouTube doesn't suck?

01:13:41.520 --> 01:13:46.480
I think there comes a point in every YouTuber's career where you've been around long enough

01:13:46.480 --> 01:13:52.160
to where you reach this inevitable question of, what am I doing here?

01:13:52.160 --> 01:13:54.160
What are we doing here?

01:13:54.160 --> 01:13:59.520
I mean, you can only get so many views and subscribers before it all starts to just fade

01:13:59.520 --> 01:14:03.020
away into meaningless numbers.

01:14:03.020 --> 01:14:07.880
After a while, the whole YouTube experience that people think they're getting into just

01:14:07.880 --> 01:14:11.200
all becomes sort of peripheral.

01:14:11.200 --> 01:14:13.200
Just a bunch of statistics.

01:14:13.200 --> 01:14:18.840
No more tangible than the electricity coming out of your computer screen.

01:14:18.840 --> 01:14:24.300
And so that was kind of the point I was at in mid-2018.

01:14:24.300 --> 01:14:30.480
For the past five years or so, I'd been motivated by a variety of different factors.

01:14:30.480 --> 01:14:35.520
It felt like over that whole period, I had been making videos for someone else.

01:14:35.520 --> 01:14:40.880
Whether I was trying too hard to please the audience or trying too hard to prove a point

01:14:40.880 --> 01:14:48.520
to them, I was all of a sudden asking myself what I wanted and what I wanted to get out

01:14:48.520 --> 01:14:50.380
of making videos.

01:14:50.380 --> 01:14:54.440
From that point on, I pretty much just put my head down and started working on what I

01:14:54.440 --> 01:14:57.600
thought were good videos.

01:14:57.600 --> 01:15:03.420
I started turning up the work and the research and the editing to make my stuff something

01:15:03.420 --> 01:15:05.460
that I could be proud of.

01:15:05.460 --> 01:15:09.800
I think the real turning point for me was the Leafy video.

01:15:09.800 --> 01:15:14.400
This was the first time I can remember where I basically just buckled down for an entire

01:15:14.400 --> 01:15:20.760
month where I just worked my ass off to create this good product.

01:15:20.760 --> 01:15:22.400
It ended up being quite successful.

01:15:22.400 --> 01:15:26.440
I got a lot of attention and views and subscribers for it.

01:15:26.440 --> 01:15:31.080
But the one thing about that video that I found really encouraging was that it felt

01:15:31.080 --> 01:15:36.680
like the first time I'd used my power on YouTube constructively.

01:15:36.680 --> 01:15:41.880
Where I'd presented a project so engaging that a lot of people who watched it ended

01:15:41.880 --> 01:15:47.640
up changing their mind about something that they thought they knew very well.

01:15:47.640 --> 01:15:53.560
It's often difficult on YouTube to tell whether you're actually good and talented at something

01:15:53.560 --> 01:16:00.920
or whether your success is just a circumstance of hype and bandwagoning off the latest trend.

01:16:00.920 --> 01:16:05.360
And with the Leafy video, people were definitely impressed.

01:16:05.360 --> 01:16:09.020
I could tell that my success was no fluke.

01:16:09.020 --> 01:16:11.160
I'd put out a good product.

01:16:11.160 --> 01:16:16.400
And now it was time to use my abilities to make more videos like it.

01:16:16.400 --> 01:16:21.920
So during the whole time I was making rant videos complaining about how much things sucked,

01:16:21.920 --> 01:16:30.760
there was sort of this opposite voice welling up in me, wanting to take the opposite approach.

01:16:30.760 --> 01:16:36.800
Where instead of spending all this time shaming mediocrity, I create a series where I celebrate

01:16:36.800 --> 01:16:37.800
greatness.

01:16:37.800 --> 01:16:43.520
I mean, after all, greatness is a lot more special than mediocrity.

01:16:43.520 --> 01:16:47.760
And part of me for a while felt like it was worth talking about it.

01:16:47.760 --> 01:16:52.720
So this idea about celebrating excellence eventually turned into my most successful

01:16:52.720 --> 01:16:54.760
video series to date.

01:16:54.760 --> 01:17:02.000
Never ever.

01:17:02.000 --> 01:17:07.960
It's hard to believe that I've only made six episodes so far because its impact has felt

01:17:07.960 --> 01:17:10.280
much more significant than that.

01:17:10.280 --> 01:17:16.440
I don't think I originally envisioned the series to be like that, but it ended up becoming

01:17:16.440 --> 01:17:18.100
quite special.

01:17:18.100 --> 01:17:24.260
And that was simply a product of each episode's subject being special to me.

01:17:24.260 --> 01:17:30.260
I ended up going the extra mile to make sure that these topics were treated with the care

01:17:30.260 --> 01:17:32.680
and respect that they deserved.

01:17:32.680 --> 01:17:39.020
I was very fortunate that never ever succeeded in the way that it did because it helped transform

01:17:39.020 --> 01:17:45.220
my channel from this place of rage and negativity into something that was a lot more positive

01:17:45.220 --> 01:17:48.260
and a lot more pleasant.

01:17:48.260 --> 01:17:55.420
It definitely inspired a turn for my videos to become a whole lot less cynical and bitter.

01:17:55.420 --> 01:18:01.420
I mean, you could say whatever you want about these videos, but you have to admit that they

01:18:01.420 --> 01:18:02.800
have heart.

01:18:02.800 --> 01:18:07.540
And sometimes on YouTube, that's all people are looking for.

01:18:07.540 --> 01:18:11.420
A lot of people out there, they don't have it so good.

01:18:11.420 --> 01:18:17.460
A lot of them come to YouTube wanting really hard to feel something.

01:18:17.460 --> 01:18:25.420
And I'm glad that my videos have been able to provide that service to so many.

01:18:25.420 --> 01:18:33.340
So by the end of 2019, I graduated from college and I had a pretty big decision to make.

01:18:33.340 --> 01:18:40.380
Leading up to it, you would have never guessed that I would have picked YouTube, but I did.

01:18:40.420 --> 01:18:46.820
I remember looking at my videos and my body of work over the last year and for the first

01:18:46.820 --> 01:18:52.540
time in my whole career, I was actually impressed with myself.

01:18:52.540 --> 01:18:55.320
And by this point, my channel was growing again.

01:18:55.320 --> 01:19:02.980
I had successfully recovered a new audience that were excited and eager to engage with

01:19:02.980 --> 01:19:05.000
what I was going to put out next.

01:19:05.000 --> 01:19:10.240
I felt like I was earning a level of respect that I didn't even come close to getting

01:19:10.240 --> 01:19:12.680
back when I made YouTube poops.

01:19:12.680 --> 01:19:13.680
Downward spiral.

01:19:13.680 --> 01:19:16.560
I'm gonna dig straight to hell, gamers.

01:19:16.560 --> 01:19:21.680
And I think that's what ultimately ended up convincing me to take the leap of faith

01:19:21.680 --> 01:19:26.400
and actually pursue YouTube full time.

01:19:26.400 --> 01:19:32.600
It's like at long last, after spending so much time making these videos, I'm finally

01:19:32.600 --> 01:19:38.580
at a place where I feel like I belong and that the people around me and the people who

01:19:38.580 --> 01:19:41.580
watch me believe in me.

01:19:41.580 --> 01:19:49.540
And I think that was enough to finally make me believe in myself.

01:19:49.540 --> 01:19:52.580
Didn't you and I have a podcast around this time too?

01:19:52.580 --> 01:19:54.580
Wait, what?

01:19:54.580 --> 01:19:56.580
Oh, that.

01:19:56.580 --> 01:20:05.220
Uh, let's just say that there are certain things I'd prefer to leave in the past.

01:20:05.220 --> 01:20:10.220
You know, for the longest time, I had been treating my YouTube career like I had nothing

01:20:10.220 --> 01:20:11.500
to lose.

01:20:11.500 --> 01:20:18.100
And that was honestly how I felt for years because I died the YouTube death.

01:20:18.100 --> 01:20:23.960
People weren't supposed to come back from losing 99% of their audience.

01:20:23.960 --> 01:20:27.240
For most YouTubers, that's supposed to be the nail in the coffin.

01:20:27.240 --> 01:20:31.460
It's basically just the internet telling you to pack up your things and leave.

01:20:31.460 --> 01:20:35.020
And most people, when they find themselves in that situation, they do.

01:20:35.020 --> 01:20:36.660
They up and leave.

01:20:36.660 --> 01:20:38.040
I didn't though.

01:20:38.040 --> 01:20:41.860
It was like I had been fired and just kept showing up to the office.

01:20:41.860 --> 01:20:45.580
Pretty much everything that came out of my channel after that point was just supposed

01:20:45.580 --> 01:20:47.380
to be gravy.

01:20:47.380 --> 01:20:51.840
It wasn't really supposed to amount to what it did.

01:20:51.840 --> 01:20:57.300
During that time period, shortly after the downward spiral, I acted brazen for sure.

01:20:57.300 --> 01:21:01.900
I acted like someone who probably wouldn't have their career much longer because back

01:21:01.900 --> 01:21:07.020
then, I certainly felt like I didn't need YouTube and that they didn't need me.

01:21:07.020 --> 01:21:10.460
Well, what a difference a few years can make.

01:21:10.460 --> 01:21:13.740
My relationship with YouTube certainly changed.

01:21:13.740 --> 01:21:21.440
All of a sudden, I leveraged a lot on my YouTube success and I could no longer afford to treat

01:21:21.440 --> 01:21:24.780
it as flippantly as I once was.

01:21:24.780 --> 01:21:30.280
I was no longer in a position where I could just throw caution at the wind and make whatever

01:21:30.280 --> 01:21:38.380
video and upload whatever trash and hold the audience in such contempt as I once had.

01:21:38.380 --> 01:21:44.120
There were a lot more stakes now and for the first time ever, I really needed the channel

01:21:44.120 --> 01:21:45.780
to succeed.

01:21:45.780 --> 01:21:50.840
And these high stakes all of a sudden became very apparent just a couple of months after

01:21:50.840 --> 01:21:53.840
I decided to do YouTube full-time.

01:21:53.840 --> 01:21:59.880
Of course, in the spring of 2020, COVID hit everything and shut everything down.

01:21:59.880 --> 01:22:03.240
People in the conventional job market got screwed.

01:22:03.240 --> 01:22:09.560
They basically got laid off with no means of income for the foreseeable future.

01:22:09.560 --> 01:22:14.680
All of a sudden, the stable real job that everyone told me would be a sure thing and

01:22:14.680 --> 01:22:20.360
told me it would be foolish to give up to chase some pipe dream of making YouTube videos

01:22:20.360 --> 01:22:25.660
for a living, all of a sudden, that didn't look like such a good option.

01:22:25.700 --> 01:22:31.220
I don't hold it against people for warning me that it was foolish to pursue YouTube because

01:22:31.220 --> 01:22:32.540
it was.

01:22:32.540 --> 01:22:37.620
At the time, every single indicator showed that it was a foolish decision.

01:22:37.620 --> 01:22:43.740
But I just look back at that decision in absolute awe at how things worked out and how so quickly

01:22:43.740 --> 01:22:49.800
the sure thing white collar cubicle job just became toxic.

01:22:49.800 --> 01:22:54.220
It felt like being on one of the last life rafts off of the Titanic.

01:22:54.220 --> 01:23:00.300
It's definitely a strange feeling to get what seems like a lot of breaks in the way that

01:23:00.300 --> 01:23:01.880
I have.

01:23:01.880 --> 01:23:07.620
Sometimes it feels like I'm falling into protagonist syndrome with just how fortunate things ended

01:23:07.620 --> 01:23:08.620
up.

01:23:08.620 --> 01:23:14.580
Or it's almost like I have this plot armor around me that insists the show must go on.

01:23:14.580 --> 01:23:18.980
I think back to all those times when I thought about quitting YouTube entirely.

01:23:18.980 --> 01:23:21.100
And there were many of them.

01:23:21.100 --> 01:23:27.100
And now I'm probably just going to be doing this and making these videos until I physically

01:23:27.100 --> 01:23:29.380
cannot anymore.

01:23:29.380 --> 01:23:33.780
That's not to say it's been entirely smooth sailing, because it hasn't.

01:23:33.780 --> 01:23:38.820
There were certainly a lot of demons from the past that continued to haunt me.

01:23:38.820 --> 01:23:44.580
Behind the meme, you know, after I made that video about him, things didn't really work

01:23:44.580 --> 01:23:46.220
out for the guy.

01:23:46.220 --> 01:23:48.660
You want to talk about the downward spiral?

01:23:48.660 --> 01:23:52.460
Well, it probably hit a little too close to home for him.

01:23:52.460 --> 01:23:57.260
You know, there are a lot of other YouTubers back then who also made videos shitting on

01:23:57.260 --> 01:24:02.980
the guy, many of whom were way more popular than I was at the time.

01:24:02.980 --> 01:24:07.380
But no, historically, I'm going to go down as the guy who basically bullied behind the

01:24:07.380 --> 01:24:08.980
meme into retirement.

01:24:08.980 --> 01:24:15.580
It might not be exactly fair to see it that way, but I guess it goes to show, out of all

01:24:15.580 --> 01:24:21.140
those videos made about him, mine was certainly the most persuasive.

01:24:21.140 --> 01:24:25.900
It seemed like it took a while for my channel to get back in good standing with YouTube

01:24:25.900 --> 01:24:29.340
after the whole tank the rewind thing.

01:24:29.340 --> 01:24:35.360
Of course, it probably helped my case that one year after I instigated that whole movement,

01:24:35.360 --> 01:24:40.780
YouTube released the 2018 rewind that went on to become the most disliked video in YouTube

01:24:40.780 --> 01:24:42.220
history.

01:24:42.220 --> 01:24:48.200
I think that kind of took a bit of the heat off of me to sort of show that maybe it was

01:24:48.200 --> 01:24:53.380
more of a YouTube problem than an M.Plemon problem that the rewind got disliked.

01:24:53.380 --> 01:25:00.500
And I think whatever bad blood they had for me, they kind of had to excuse it after that.

01:25:00.500 --> 01:25:05.720
After enough time had passed, the demonetization that was once terrorizing pretty much everything

01:25:05.720 --> 01:25:08.620
I made, it died down.

01:25:08.620 --> 01:25:13.260
For the past two years, pretty much, I haven't had a problem with it.

01:25:13.260 --> 01:25:18.580
I think by far, though, the most punishing sins that continued to follow me around was,

01:25:18.580 --> 01:25:21.620
of course, the old YouTube poops.

01:25:21.620 --> 01:25:26.620
By the end of 2017, I pretty much stopped making them entirely.

01:25:26.620 --> 01:25:29.660
There wasn't really a big goodbye or anything like that.

01:25:29.660 --> 01:25:34.380
I just sort of made them until I no longer cared to do so.

01:25:34.380 --> 01:25:40.180
But even though I had pretty clearly left and moved on to greener pastures, I was still

01:25:40.180 --> 01:25:44.940
getting my fair share of drama and controversy from that scene.

01:25:44.940 --> 01:25:50.540
It was just like a bunch of ghouls who would just not forgive me for how I exited that

01:25:50.540 --> 01:25:51.640
community.

01:25:51.640 --> 01:25:55.160
And after a while, I got sick of it and just called them all out on it.

01:25:55.160 --> 01:25:57.820
I made it known that I left for a reason.

01:25:57.820 --> 01:26:03.520
And a lot of these people that just continued bitching for years after I left, they definitely

01:26:03.520 --> 01:26:05.460
had their hand to play in it.

01:26:05.460 --> 01:26:06.460
And it sucks.

01:26:06.460 --> 01:26:11.840
It sucks that I left on such bad terms, but there are certain things you encounter in

01:26:11.840 --> 01:26:15.400
your life that are just toxic.

01:26:15.400 --> 01:26:20.840
And it's up to you to remove them and move on to a better place.

01:26:20.840 --> 01:26:25.580
I think the saddest part of all of it was the YouTube poops themselves.

01:26:25.580 --> 01:26:32.480
I had moved on from that time period for sure, but it still represented a significant part

01:26:32.480 --> 01:26:33.840
of my personal history.

01:26:33.840 --> 01:26:38.360
I mean, it's not something you could just throw away in a race.

01:26:38.360 --> 01:26:42.980
Those memories of spending all those hours making those videos, they're going to be around

01:26:42.980 --> 01:26:45.120
as long as I'm around.

01:26:45.120 --> 01:26:50.600
You know, for as much animosity as I had leaving that community, it still very much shaped

01:26:50.600 --> 01:26:53.480
the creator that I would eventually become.

01:26:53.480 --> 01:26:59.760
I'm not one to try to delete videos and obfuscate the past, no matter how unsavory it might

01:26:59.760 --> 01:27:01.080
be.

01:27:01.080 --> 01:27:05.280
Many other YouTubers in my position would have deleted them off their channel a while

01:27:05.280 --> 01:27:08.220
ago, but I wanted to keep them up.

01:27:08.220 --> 01:27:12.840
They were an essential part of my history that represented pretty much half of the time

01:27:12.840 --> 01:27:16.340
that I spent making content on this website.

01:27:16.340 --> 01:27:18.020
Most of my new viewers, they don't care.

01:27:18.020 --> 01:27:20.680
They're obviously here to watch the new stuff.

01:27:20.680 --> 01:27:26.680
But for anyone who did and was curious into how I got to where I got, they were there

01:27:26.680 --> 01:27:28.100
for them.

01:27:28.100 --> 01:27:29.100
And I tried.

01:27:29.140 --> 01:27:32.580
I tried to keep them up for as long as I could.

01:27:32.580 --> 01:27:37.900
But eventually they put me into a position where their existence on my channel became

01:27:37.900 --> 01:27:40.280
untenable.

01:27:40.280 --> 01:27:45.740
I always got the suspicion that YouTube and their internal systems didn't like that I

01:27:45.740 --> 01:27:49.660
had all these radically different videos on my channel.

01:27:49.660 --> 01:27:54.520
For my entire career, I had seen my catalog of YouTube poops slowly but surely decay away

01:27:54.520 --> 01:27:59.000
and become no longer viewable to the public.

01:27:59.000 --> 01:28:04.600
I really tried to keep them up for as long as I could to preserve the memory.

01:28:04.600 --> 01:28:10.020
But in June of last year, one of those videos put me in just such a bad situation that I

01:28:10.020 --> 01:28:13.800
couldn't justify keeping them up on the channel anymore.

01:28:13.800 --> 01:28:21.020
It was somewhat fitting that the big problem came from the original Green Simpsons video.

01:28:21.020 --> 01:28:25.200
The video that arguably started the downward spiral to begin with.

01:28:25.220 --> 01:28:29.580
Basically, YouTube flagged that video for terrorist activity.

01:28:29.580 --> 01:28:35.300
And I didn't know it at the time, but when you get a strike of that nature, YouTube strips

01:28:35.300 --> 01:28:38.940
your entire channel of monetization.

01:28:38.940 --> 01:28:46.700
So within one instant, after getting one strike, I was making $0 off of any of my videos.

01:28:46.700 --> 01:28:52.060
Had it happened earlier in my career, I just would have had no way out and I would have

01:28:52.060 --> 01:28:54.800
been forced to quit right there.

01:28:54.800 --> 01:29:00.300
Thankfully, I've reached a position in the YouTube community where I know enough people

01:29:00.300 --> 01:29:06.480
who know people at YouTube and they can actually go in and manually get it resolved.

01:29:06.480 --> 01:29:12.800
After 48 hours, I had my monetization restored and the biggest scare I had ever had on this

01:29:12.800 --> 01:29:15.600
channel was averted.

01:29:15.620 --> 01:29:22.860
But in those two days where I had my primary source of revenue stripped, I felt horrible.

01:29:22.860 --> 01:29:25.260
I felt downright depressed.

01:29:25.260 --> 01:29:29.860
I was at a point where I couldn't imagine myself doing anything else than making YouTube

01:29:29.860 --> 01:29:31.700
videos.

01:29:31.700 --> 01:29:37.640
If that would have been the end of my career, I don't know what I would have done.

01:29:37.640 --> 01:29:43.260
Anything else I would have done with my life, I would have just been a ghost.

01:29:43.260 --> 01:29:46.240
My heart wouldn't be in it.

01:29:46.240 --> 01:29:47.240
It's excruciating.

01:29:47.240 --> 01:29:54.400
It was an excruciating position to be in and it was only possible because of these YouTube

01:29:54.400 --> 01:30:00.380
poop videos that were continuing to just cause me problems.

01:30:00.380 --> 01:30:07.120
And so I sat on the idea for about a month and eventually I went through with it, where

01:30:07.120 --> 01:30:12.360
I went through and privated every single YouTube poop on my channel.

01:30:12.360 --> 01:30:13.940
Well not every single one.

01:30:13.940 --> 01:30:20.180
I left my very first YouTube poop up just as sort of a totem to show people that this

01:30:20.180 --> 01:30:22.220
is where it all began.

01:30:22.220 --> 01:30:25.780
But everything else was pretty much gone.

01:30:25.780 --> 01:30:30.520
That whole part of my history erased.

01:30:30.520 --> 01:30:31.520
It was tough.

01:30:31.520 --> 01:30:33.400
I felt real bad about it.

01:30:33.400 --> 01:30:37.280
But you know, when I made the announcement that I was getting rid of them, something

01:30:37.280 --> 01:30:44.420
very funny happened, where all the old Emperor Lemon fans started to come out of the woodwork,

01:30:44.420 --> 01:30:49.620
telling me how much they loved the videos, how they were so sad to see them go.

01:30:49.620 --> 01:30:55.060
I really wish they could have been around when I actually needed to hear that.

01:30:55.060 --> 01:31:00.100
You know, back then, choosing to leave YouTube poop in the first place, I certainly didn't

01:31:00.100 --> 01:31:03.080
feel appreciated.

01:31:03.080 --> 01:31:09.420
Part of me wishes I had known then that these stupid videos actually did matter to a lot

01:31:09.420 --> 01:31:11.080
of people.

01:31:11.080 --> 01:31:14.000
But you know, it had to be done.

01:31:14.000 --> 01:31:19.840
There was really no other way for me to constantly continue with this channel that I financially

01:31:19.840 --> 01:31:24.960
depend on and jeopardize it in the way that these videos were.

01:31:24.960 --> 01:31:29.680
I came to view it as basically 50 ticking time bombs, where it's only a matter of time

01:31:29.680 --> 01:31:34.780
before any one of them could cause catastrophic issues in the future.

01:31:34.780 --> 01:31:36.420
I had to do it.

01:31:36.420 --> 01:31:40.980
I had to close that chapter of my career forever.

01:31:40.980 --> 01:31:45.380
And then, once the deed was done, the funniest thing happened.

01:31:45.380 --> 01:31:49.320
The next video I uploaded got on the Trending tab.

01:31:49.320 --> 01:31:53.640
I always considered myself on the side of the platform that YouTube never wanted to

01:31:53.640 --> 01:31:54.900
acknowledge.

01:31:54.900 --> 01:32:02.100
And yet here it was, my video on Trending, the ultimate trophy case of YouTube favoritism.

01:32:02.100 --> 01:32:06.900
To me, it was almost like a sign that after I'd sacrificed something so near and dear

01:32:06.900 --> 01:32:12.840
to me, YouTube had finally relented and gave me the green light.

01:32:12.840 --> 01:32:17.760
And ever since then, my videos have been performing better than at any point in the history of

01:32:17.760 --> 01:32:19.560
my career.

01:32:19.560 --> 01:32:25.680
I don't know if I believe in destiny, but with how this YouTube thing worked out, it's

01:32:25.680 --> 01:32:29.400
really made me considerate.

01:32:29.400 --> 01:32:37.040
So what does it mean that EmPlemon reached a million subscribers?

01:32:37.040 --> 01:32:44.000
Something that realistically, in all likelihood, should have never happened in a million years.

01:32:44.000 --> 01:32:46.760
But here we are.

01:32:46.760 --> 01:32:52.200
I reached the proverbial YouTube mountaintop, the lifetime achievement award for a career

01:32:52.200 --> 01:32:54.200
well spent.

01:32:54.200 --> 01:32:59.520
Twelve years of trying, twelve years of frustration, but I made it.

01:32:59.520 --> 01:33:04.080
I made it to the point that every YouTuber wants to reach when they first open up their

01:33:04.080 --> 01:33:05.720
account.

01:33:05.720 --> 01:33:08.240
It shouldn't have been possible.

01:33:08.240 --> 01:33:14.180
Based on the types of videos I made and how I presented myself and all the times I wanted

01:33:14.180 --> 01:33:17.460
to give up, it shouldn't have happened.

01:33:17.460 --> 01:33:23.760
I'm not usually one to look at my subscriber numbers, but when the day came, I tuned in.

01:33:23.760 --> 01:33:28.960
Seeing that number cross over to a million, it's something you only get to experience

01:33:28.960 --> 01:33:30.940
once in a lifetime.

01:33:30.940 --> 01:33:36.860
And so when the moment finally came, I just sort of sat there in front of my computer

01:33:36.860 --> 01:33:39.940
monitor in stunned silence.

01:33:39.940 --> 01:33:45.660
I felt like I just crossed over into a new reality that I didn't imagine was possible.

01:33:45.660 --> 01:33:51.140
I mean, I thought I was capable of getting pretty far in YouTube, but not this far.

01:33:51.140 --> 01:33:56.060
I always imagined that something would have come up and stopped me before I got the chance

01:33:56.060 --> 01:33:58.360
to experience that moment.

01:33:58.360 --> 01:33:59.660
But there it was.

01:33:59.660 --> 01:34:02.300
I reached the million.

01:34:02.300 --> 01:34:06.540
People can say what they want about me, but that's something that they can never take

01:34:06.540 --> 01:34:08.140
away.

01:34:08.140 --> 01:34:14.180
It's a big milestone, possibly the biggest that any YouTuber can experience.

01:34:14.180 --> 01:34:21.540
I don't anticipate any other subscriber number being as impactful as seeing those digits

01:34:21.540 --> 01:34:25.120
cross over into seven figures for the first time.

01:34:25.120 --> 01:34:29.380
It was like when I reached a million, the credits of YouTube start rolling.

01:34:29.380 --> 01:34:31.640
You've pretty much beaten the game.

01:34:31.640 --> 01:34:36.720
Once you've reached that level of success, you've made it to the big leagues.

01:34:36.720 --> 01:34:43.600
And I wasn't really sure at the time if I was ready to take that step.

01:34:43.600 --> 01:34:47.280
Yeah, at the end of the day, it's just a number.

01:34:47.280 --> 01:34:52.220
Nothing in reality tangibly changed from either side of that moment.

01:34:52.220 --> 01:34:56.920
But I'll tell you what, I certainly felt different.

01:34:56.920 --> 01:35:02.700
I felt like suddenly a huge weight and a huge pressure had been lifted, almost like

01:35:02.700 --> 01:35:09.400
that chip on my shoulder I had for so many years had finally run out of steam.

01:35:09.400 --> 01:35:13.440
You know, I've always been someone who's been motivated by the chase and not so much the

01:35:13.440 --> 01:35:14.520
trophy.

01:35:14.520 --> 01:35:19.260
It was hard work getting to a million, 12 years of my life.

01:35:19.260 --> 01:35:24.520
As of that moment, I think I actually spent a majority of my life making YouTube videos.

01:35:25.320 --> 01:35:30.400
But you know, throughout the whole story, I kind of felt this force pulling me along

01:35:30.400 --> 01:35:36.140
because it was difficult, because a guy like me wasn't supposed to make it.

01:35:36.140 --> 01:35:41.000
And throughout my whole career, I've always kind of made it my mission to prove people

01:35:41.000 --> 01:35:42.000
wrong.

01:35:42.000 --> 01:35:46.600
You know, finally reaching a million after all this time, it was really validating for

01:35:46.600 --> 01:35:47.840
sure.

01:35:47.840 --> 01:35:52.880
But I feel like I also lost a bit of the mojo that carried me to this point in the first

01:35:52.880 --> 01:35:54.040
place.

01:35:54.040 --> 01:35:59.320
I think thus far I've definitely been in a different mindset coming out of it.

01:35:59.320 --> 01:36:04.360
And I'm just going to have to wait and see how that turns out.

01:36:04.360 --> 01:36:08.240
And that pretty much brings us to today.

01:36:08.240 --> 01:36:13.740
So I guess that's the story of my YouTube channel.

01:36:13.740 --> 01:36:20.360
You know, there may be many others like it, but this one is mine.

01:36:20.360 --> 01:36:25.640
Did he seriously just fall asleep?

01:36:25.640 --> 01:36:28.200
Who am I kidding?

01:36:28.200 --> 01:36:33.360
It's the best he's been at therapy in years.

01:36:33.360 --> 01:36:34.880
Sorry for dozing off there.

01:36:34.880 --> 01:36:38.160
The story was just kind of dragging on a bit.

01:36:38.160 --> 01:36:39.620
Oh, come on, Rusty.

01:36:39.620 --> 01:36:42.520
This is supposed to be a special moment.

01:36:42.520 --> 01:36:43.520
Don't you feel special?

01:36:43.520 --> 01:36:49.940
I mean, after all, I don't exactly do this kind of stuff every day.

01:36:49.940 --> 01:36:50.940
So is that it?

01:36:50.940 --> 01:36:54.480
Is the downward spiral finally over?

01:36:54.480 --> 01:36:58.860
You know what?

01:36:58.860 --> 01:37:01.220
I don't know about that.

01:37:01.220 --> 01:37:06.260
You know, for the past six years, ever since I stopped making YouTube poops, I've been

01:37:06.260 --> 01:37:09.780
telling myself that I've been on a downward spiral.

01:37:09.780 --> 01:37:15.380
But now that I've passed a million, can I even still say that anymore?

01:37:15.380 --> 01:37:20.620
Now that my career has finally reached the point where I passed that magic number, has

01:37:20.620 --> 01:37:24.020
the downward spiral ceased to exist?

01:37:24.020 --> 01:37:30.860
You know, have I finally come out of it, where I no longer have the grounds to complain about

01:37:30.860 --> 01:37:33.760
how I've been treated on YouTube?

01:37:33.760 --> 01:37:39.280
Because for the last couple of years, I'd say I've been treated pretty well.

01:37:39.280 --> 01:37:43.460
And for part of me, it's hard to admit that.

01:37:43.460 --> 01:37:48.700
You know, based on my experiences on YouTube and just how close I was at so many points

01:37:48.700 --> 01:37:56.300
to the edge of control, I'm of the philosophy that it can all just go away in an instant.

01:37:56.300 --> 01:38:01.900
And what's strange to think about is that how I feel now is oddly similar to how I felt

01:38:01.900 --> 01:38:07.340
back in 2014, when everything seemed like it was going so well.

01:38:07.340 --> 01:38:12.980
You know, going through the downward spiral back at 100K, I ended up surviving, yeah,

01:38:13.500 --> 01:38:16.660
but it wasn't without its consequences.

01:38:16.660 --> 01:38:19.460
It took a toll on me, for sure.

01:38:19.460 --> 01:38:24.380
And I look at my channel now versus then, and it's 10 times bigger.

01:38:24.380 --> 01:38:28.700
If you ask me, that's 10 times farther to fall.

01:38:28.700 --> 01:38:36.360
It's a fall that's daunting enough where I'm not quite sure if I could survive this time around.

01:38:36.360 --> 01:38:41.620
And so I think I'll always have that fear in the back of my head that the downward spiral

01:38:41.660 --> 01:38:46.460
is not yet finished, and that I haven't seen the worst of it.

01:38:46.460 --> 01:38:51.140
But hey, at the end of the day, that's the burden I carry.

01:38:51.140 --> 01:38:52.580
It ain't easy being green.

01:39:11.620 --> 01:39:13.620
It ain't easy being green.
