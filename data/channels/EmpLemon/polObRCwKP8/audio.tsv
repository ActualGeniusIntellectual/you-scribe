0	25820	You've been coming in here for a while now, and we've made some progress, no doubt.
25820	29820	But so far, we've been unable to reach a breakthrough.
29820	33540	However, today, something's different.
33540	35460	I can feel it.
35460	40400	You've experienced a lot of significant change in your life, and I suspect that you're finally
40400	42800	ready to open up.
42800	47100	So all that said, I'm going to ask this one more time.
47100	57420	What is the downward spiral?
57420	61420	I was born in 1998 on a Sunday.
61420	68780	When I look back at that year with our modern understanding of how things turned out, it
68780	72900	can be largely seen as a pinnacle.
72900	78720	America was by far the most feared and respected country in the world.
78720	82780	Some of the greatest athletes in this country had the crowning achievement of their entire
82780	84060	careers.
84060	86400	John Elway won the Super Bowl.
86400	89680	Dale Earnhardt won the Daytona 500.
89680	95820	Michael Jordan captured his sixth and final NBA title.
95820	102780	The President of the United States was still an office that was somewhat respected and
102780	104580	revered.
104580	108780	It's tough to look back then, knowing now how things turned out.
108780	117460	I mean, when you look at America now, suffice to say, we've kind of fallen on hard times.
117460	124180	In fact, when you look at just about every measurable aspect of life, it would seem that
124180	130460	just about everything is getting steadily and steadily worse.
130460	137580	It's almost like I came into this world right at the moment when everything started to go
137580	139940	downward.
139940	146320	So if you're asking me when the downward spiral began, the only thing I can say is that it
146320	152220	had to have started sometime between then and now.
152260	157380	The first time I saw YouTube, I was at my friend Todd's house.
157380	162740	I remember we spent all afternoon watching stuff like Charlie the Unicorn, the Laser
162740	168980	Collection, Clay World, all this stuff made by amateur 20-year-olds.
168980	174460	I was still a kid at the time, and before that, I watched a lot of TV, as many people
174460	176620	my age probably did.
176620	179620	Cartoon Network, Nickelodeon.
179620	184540	You pour hours and afternoons into just watching that.
184540	189060	Even at such an early age, I could understand that the effort that went into making a TV
189060	195420	show was something that was seemingly not replicable on just an individual scale.
195420	202580	So when I first tuned in to YouTube and saw people making things by themselves, regular
202580	210060	people with no skills, no prestige, no anything, they could just hop in, make some creative
210060	214580	project and upload it for millions of people to see.
214580	216900	That was mind-blowing to me.
216900	223300	It was like discovering a whole new dimension, and I was hooked, man.
223300	229100	Basically every day I'd come home from school and watch the same videos, I'd watch new videos.
229620	235580	It was truly a brilliant time, and back then on YouTube, no one knew what they were doing.
235580	240220	Everyone was just free to sort of make whatever they wanted.
240220	246180	There were no formulas, there was no trying to appease some sort of algorithm.
246180	251460	People just made stuff that they thought other people would want to see.
251460	259300	There's a real beauty and a simplicity about that era, about people just going out there,
259300	261300	throwing caution into the wind.
261300	268240	But out of all the crazy stuff on this Wild West era of YouTube at the time, I was drawn
268240	273500	into one very particular subgenre.
273500	279740	To date it sort of goes by many names, but back then it had one name, and it was called
279740	281380	YouTube Poop.
281380	284420	Look what I got under me, kid!
284420	288060	So, YouTube Poops, what are they?
288060	295580	I feel like I had a better understanding of it when I was younger, before I developed
295580	299240	the logical means of adult thinking.
299240	305460	To describe YouTube Poop, the closest thing I could compare it to, I guess as a metaphor,
305460	308860	would be digital graffiti.
308860	315300	You're taking these pre-established works, something that's been composed by thousands
315300	320940	of man-hours of professional production, and then you and your 12-year-old wisdom basically
320940	324500	just turn it into a bunch of nonsense.
324500	329860	I guess the part that drew me in is the idea that you can take this existing thing that
329860	336900	everyone knows and transform it in a way where all of a sudden it's like a whole new thing.
336940	339340	Something like Spongebob and Patrick cursing.
339340	342180	There ain't nothing fancy about that word!
342180	343180	You mean fuck?
343180	344860	Yes, that one!
344860	352020	It's like staring into an alternate twisted reality, but with YouTube Poops it sort of
352020	354620	became real.
354620	359340	It was like power, power given to the hand of a mad architect.
359340	365740	I think sometimes it's fun for us to watch something be created, because we know how
365780	369180	fun it may be to destroy.
369180	376300	So in 2010 I've been browsing YouTube, sitting as the silent watcher, and I figure, hey,
376300	378720	I might as well throw my hat in the ring.
378720	381620	It's free, I'm a kid, I have the time.
381620	386840	Let's try to make a YouTube Poop and upload it to a new channel.
386840	391920	And I guess that was the beginning of Emperor Lemon.
391920	398640	So it's March of 2010, and I'm getting ready to upload my very first YouTube Poop.
398640	403720	It was like a four minute edit of the Spongebob episode Idiot Box.
403720	408640	I think I worked on it for weeks, like every day coming home from school, I was obsessed
408640	409640	with it.
409640	413600	I was so eager, ready to just put it out to the world.
413600	420800	So I go to click upload, post my very first video ever, and I get the notification in
420800	427040	my video manager saying that it's been blocked worldwide for a copyright claim.
427040	431980	Well, and that was my welcome to YouTube moment.
431980	437520	It's interesting looking back, knowing the history of this channel, that even from the
437520	443200	very beginning, I was having problems with YouTube.
443200	447040	But okay, it's a rather inauspicious start.
447040	449680	Let's try something new.
449680	454680	And so a couple of months later, I end up posting what is the actual first video that
454680	458240	appears on this channel.
458240	462560	You can never have another first video or first few videos.
462560	465080	There's something so fun about it.
465080	469680	I kind of envy YouTubers who are just starting out.
469680	474480	And that may sound awful rich because any YouTuber starts out as trying to get where
474480	475480	I am.
476480	480680	When you're starting out, there's no expectations.
480680	485140	You don't got an audience, you could just make what you want.
485140	486480	You don't know what you're doing.
486480	488720	And that's great.
488720	491560	You're not jaded over the creative process.
491560	495440	You don't care about views or the algorithm.
495440	496640	It's just fun.
496640	503060	It's kind of what YouTube content is supposed to be in my opinion.
503140	505940	So you were awfully young to be starting YouTube.
505940	511380	Well, that's kind of why I'm glad I wound up in a place like YouTube Poop, where you
511380	514860	could exist pretty much anonymously.
514860	520780	It definitely helped shield me from any personal scrutiny that I certainly wasn't ready for
520780	521780	at the time.
521780	525340	You know, it's hard to be taken seriously as a kid online.
525340	530660	Part of the reason I gravitated towards YTP in the first place is that it allowed me to
530660	533020	be treated equally.
533020	541300	Even though, if I'm being honest with myself, I probably was a little too young at the time.
541300	548440	So my first year on YouTube, I released probably six videos.
548440	553360	I think the most views I got on any of them over that time was like a hundred.
553360	556720	Of course, at the time, I had no standards for anything.
556720	561900	But I was starting to wonder whether I would make anything that would actually break on
561900	564760	through to the next level.
564760	570440	While approaching the one year anniversary of me opening my channel, I got my first big
570440	572080	break.
572080	576840	So back in the day, there was this YouTube pooper known as Barneyisperverted.
576840	583180	He was fairly popular by YouTube Poop standards, made some pretty entertaining SpongeBob poops.
583180	589240	And even though in 2010, my first attempt to post a SpongeBob poop was thwarted by our
589240	595800	wonderful copyright system, by 2011, the heat had died down and I was actually able to post
595800	598920	a SpongeBob YouTube poop on my channel.
598920	602560	And one of these SpongeBob edits gets seen by Barney.
602560	606320	And he posts a very nice comment saying that he loved the video.
606320	609820	Now most YouTuber interactions would just stop there.
609840	614880	But back then, YouTube actually had this function on the site where you could feature somebody
614880	617480	else's video on your own channel.
617480	623820	And out of sheer generosity, Barney put my video up on his far more popular channel.
623820	629800	And after just 24 hours, the video had thousands of views and I crossed a hundred subscribers.
629800	636240	Man, for me at the time, being 13 years old and having my first taste of success on YouTube,
636240	639660	it was like Christmas had come for the second time.
639680	640840	I was so excited.
640840	644620	For that entire week, it was all I could think about.
644620	648360	Going back to the video, watching the views go up and reading comments from all these
648360	651700	people who were becoming new fans.
651700	656260	And after a few months, that video got up to over a hundred thousand views and Emperor
656260	659580	Lemon had officially arrived on the scene.
659580	664200	It took pretty much a whole year to get there, but I had finally climbed that very first
664200	666520	rung of the YouTube ladder.
666520	672480	There was still a hell of a lot further to go, but at that point, I was very content
672480	676000	to be standing on that rung.
676000	683520	It's really funny the way YouTube works sometimes where these seemingly very small events can
683520	688840	have huge consequences later on.
688840	694120	And it's just really funny to me how this one guy who has been inactive for almost a
694120	701880	decade now, a guy who pretty much nobody knows today, was single-handedly responsible for
701880	707880	setting me off on my journey to however far I get.
707880	713680	Barney may have been forgotten, but I'll never forget him.
713680	717400	YouTube back then was pretty much the Wild West.
717400	721320	If you got in trouble back then, there was no saving you.
721320	723200	People could pretty much run roughshod.
723200	727880	And if they got enough friends together to flag your videos, they could just take down
727880	732920	your channel for no reason.
732920	735640	And you'd have no one to review it, no way to appeal.
735640	739960	You just have to accept it and open up a new channel.
739960	744200	And that's how it was back then, especially in YouTube Poop where copyright was always
744200	746880	such a lingering issue.
746880	752200	So back in this time, I wasn't even sure if I was going to make it much longer.
752200	754020	And it came close.
754020	760480	My channel that you know and love today was almost terminated completely.
760480	764600	There was a time when I had two community guidelines strikes.
764600	768720	And of course back then, I didn't exactly have much to lose.
768720	776760	But it's still strange to think that the channel I'm still using more than 12 years later almost
776760	779640	ceased to exist entirely.
779640	783960	But fortunately for me, that third strike never came.
783960	787840	And I could live to YouTube Poop another day.
787840	791960	And I kept making them through the rest of 2011 and 2012.
791960	794200	I was having a good time.
794200	797040	And people liked the videos.
797040	802700	And then at the beginning of 2013, I started to feel something that I hadn't ever felt
802700	805560	before while making YouTube videos.
805560	810480	I was starting to lose motivation for working on projects.
810480	815760	I think by the summer of 2013, I had gotten to around 3,500 subs.
815760	820360	But the channel wasn't really growing by any substantial amount.
820360	823860	It kind of just felt like the same old same old for a while.
823860	826840	For me, the tank was almost empty.
826840	832720	I could sort of feel like I wouldn't be around that much longer.
832720	836300	So that summer, I think about trying something a little bit different.
836300	839160	I think I worked on this video for months.
839160	844520	It was the longest I'd ever spent on any project in my entire life.
844520	848320	And by that August, it was done and ready to post.
848320	852640	I didn't know it at the time, but that one video would change everything.
852640	864720	All right, so The Uncredibles.
864720	871140	I got to say that in my 10-plus year experience of dealing with YouTube, there's certainly
871140	873680	a lot more heartache than anything worth celebrating.
873680	876900	I mean, a lot of times, it's hard.
876900	878360	It's real hard.
878360	883120	It feels like the whole deck is stacked against you.
883120	889460	But every now and then, you find these rare moments where YouTube throws you a bone.
889460	892080	And man, does it feel great.
892080	896660	I remember the video got like 50,000 views in the first week, which is something that
896660	904000	I never came close to achieving on any of the other 30 or so videos I'd done before.
904000	908120	And that was when I sort of knew that this video was different.
908120	912060	And I think by around Christmas time, it hit a million, which at the time for me was
912060	915920	just an unfathomable amount of people.
915920	918360	I was still 15 at the time.
918360	923780	And when you get that many views at that young, it just seems like you don't even know what
923780	925380	to do with it.
925380	930960	Just something about seeing that number, a million, next to something you made.
930960	937540	It's like one of the first numbers that's so big that you can't really visualize it.
937540	944820	It all happened so sudden, it was kind of unbelievable, surreal to see on my end.
944820	946120	It was crazy.
946120	952780	I didn't really know what to do other than just make more videos like it.
952780	957680	Once YouTube gives you that shot in the arm, it's addicting.
957680	963400	It's addicting having all these people watch something you made and they loved it and they
963400	966140	want something more.
966140	971300	I knew I'd made a good product and I wanted to deliver more of it.
971300	978140	I don't know if I just got extremely fortunate or what, but in 2014, I was on a hot streak.
978140	984340	There was a period for about 18 months from the tail end of 2013 to the beginning of 2015,
984340	988020	where it seemed like I couldn't miss.
988020	990300	I mean, I was riding high.
990300	991300	How could you not be?
991300	999120	I had this channel where I never really envisioned that I would be one of these fortunate people
999120	1005020	to be so successful and to get views consistently in the millions.
1005020	1011100	But there I was, I caught the wave and I was definitely enjoying myself.
1011100	1016300	Of course, that's not to say that there aren't drawbacks with growth because there certainly
1016300	1024580	are and there certainly were for me, even if I didn't really realize them at the time.
1024580	1031300	Getting elevated that high up on the pedestal, it's not without consequence.
1031300	1034060	You know, back in the day when I was just starting out, there were a lot of YouTube
1034060	1038500	poopers, many of whom I watched on a regular basis and I really enjoyed their stuff.
1038500	1040060	They were friendly to me.
1040060	1043940	They would comment on my stuff with words of support.
1043940	1052380	But once my videos started getting a ton of views, that relationship seemed to change.
1052380	1058940	There's something about the way people make YouTube poops and carry themselves where it's
1058940	1062120	almost like you're not supposed to be seen.
1062120	1065460	You're not supposed to be famous.
1065460	1070040	It's something tied up within like the pride of the unknown artist.
1070040	1074920	There was something about the nature of YouTube poops that was supposed to be anonymous.
1074920	1079660	You weren't really supposed to become a personality from it.
1079660	1084300	You weren't supposed to revel in the success.
1084300	1086560	Was there jealousy and resentment?
1086560	1089100	I mean, I guess.
1089100	1094900	We all have this same sort of expectation to put in X amount of work and get so much
1094900	1097680	out of it as a result.
1097680	1103460	There's a lot of luck involved in YouTube and a lot of people end up far more fortunate
1103460	1108680	for putting in the same work and that's just how the cookie crumbles.
1108680	1110240	But yeah, people take umbrage to that.
1110240	1112080	I get it.
1112080	1121300	I just feel like the way that I started to be treated was a little bit unfair considering
1121300	1125540	I had nothing to do with how successful my videos got.
1125540	1132400	I put them up online just like any other video and they happen to do way more views.
1132400	1138540	Perhaps it's my fault for not going out and making friends with these people when I should
1138540	1139600	have.
1139600	1145480	But once my videos started getting a lot of views, I definitely was not viewed the same
1145480	1146640	way.
1146640	1151700	You see this happen to a lot of artists in any creative field where they get a big break
1151700	1156180	and then all of a sudden people start coming out of the woodwork talking about how they
1156180	1157980	don't deserve it.
1157980	1165320	And for as much as the casual audience loved those videos, they certainly started to rub
1165320	1169460	people the wrong way in my neck of the woods.
1169460	1172700	I don't believe that I acted arrogantly.
1172700	1175700	I don't believe that I acted prideful.
1175700	1181340	That's how it may have been perceived by people back then, but that wasn't what I was putting
1181340	1182920	out.
1182920	1185120	I tried to share the success.
1185120	1189440	A lot of people forget this, but I hosted collabs.
1189440	1195940	I really tried to get a lot more talented people in the community seen.
1195940	1199540	I wanted to be generous, you know?
1199540	1206660	But it seems like no matter how much stuff I did to try to elevate other people, it wasn't
1206660	1210660	necessarily appreciated.
1210660	1214500	So you had a lot of success at a time where not many others did.
1214500	1220580	Do you ever experience regret that maybe you should have capitalized on it more?
1220580	1224180	I mean, that's how a lot of YouTubers would have treated it.
1224180	1229540	Many people on this website have found great success by taking the Machiavellian approach,
1229540	1233540	just sort of treating their audience as another means to an end.
1233540	1238540	Back then I could have definitely cashed in on something trendy like MLG montage parodies,
1238540	1242900	and who knows how my career could have turned out and just how big my audience could have
1242900	1244680	been today.
1244680	1250140	In hindsight, it's easy to envision yourself making all the right choices, so much so that
1250140	1254900	we often lose sight of how we could have made the wrong ones.
1254900	1260340	Something tells me that if I had sold out way back then, things probably wouldn't have
1260340	1262040	worked out for me.
1262040	1265300	I don't think I was ready to take that next step.
1265300	1272740	I was still way too young, and I didn't appreciate what it was like to truly struggle.
1272740	1278180	So at the end of 2014, I started off on what was probably my biggest project ever at that
1278180	1282180	point, which was the Frying Nemo series.
1282180	1288180	It basically took me six months to release these four YouTube poops covering the entire
1288180	1290860	runtime of Finding Nemo.
1290860	1296020	And for what I could realistically achieve at the time, it was ambitious.
1296020	1298900	I worked really, really hard on it.
1298900	1303820	It was the hardest I worked on any project to that point.
1303820	1308500	Somewhere along the way, I really was not having fun.
1308500	1315180	It was probably the first time making any YouTube poop where I was not really enjoying
1315180	1316620	the ride.
1316620	1323840	It was pretty much the first hint I got that my time in YouTube poop was starting to come
1323840	1325900	to a close.
1325900	1331500	I think somewhere along the way, it became less about what I want to make and more about
1331500	1335700	what I think the fans are going to enjoy watching.
1335700	1341760	And many YouTubers can attest to this, but doing that is kind of the one way to suck
1341760	1344820	the enjoyment out of whatever you're working on.
1344820	1349900	And to make matters worse, the reception to the end of the series wasn't really what
1349900	1351960	I'd been hoping for.
1351960	1360620	So a lot of the YouTube poop community, they like to reside on this forum known as YouTube.
1360620	1366740	I uploaded Deep Frying Nemo, which was part four, the final part of the Frying Nemo series.
1366740	1373140	And on the general discussion page, it was just a fucking page and a half of people ridiculing
1373140	1374640	the video.
1374640	1381000	It was hard to see all these people, many of which I looked up to and respected.
1381000	1385520	Just being so bitter about me uploading this video.
1385520	1390440	That moment for me was sort of like, I'm an outsider in this community.
1390440	1395080	I'm not really well liked anymore.
1395080	1400840	I may have been liked at one point, but I never capitalized on it enough to sort of
1400840	1402780	sustain that goodwill.
1402820	1410860	And now it seems like a lot of people in this community no longer hold me in good esteem.
1410860	1411860	And it was tough.
1411860	1418340	It was tough to be motivated to continue after that, knowing that your contemporaries, the
1418340	1425900	people you relate to most in making this very niche style of video, they don't really like
1425900	1427360	you.
1427360	1434120	I think that summer, the summer of 2015, I really started to consider stepping away from
1434120	1436040	YouTube Poop.
1436040	1440000	That summer, actually, I passed a pretty huge milestone.
1440000	1443400	I passed 100,000 subscribers.
1443400	1450300	I think only two, maybe three other people had ever gotten that far from a channel uploading
1450300	1452760	exclusively YouTube Poops.
1452760	1458440	Within that genre, there were really no more barriers left to overcome.
1458440	1460280	I'd done everything.
1460280	1468040	I don't know if I exactly knew it at the time, but ready or not, it was time for me to sort
1468040	1472880	of turn over the next page in my career.
1472880	1477800	So this is my 100,000 subscriber play button that I got back in 2015.
1477840	1483080	A lot of YouTubers today don't even know that they used to look like this, but I definitely
1483080	1485980	like the old design a lot better.
1485980	1488720	It felt a lot more personal and special.
1488720	1494740	I guess you could say that's how the whole site was back then.
1494740	1500880	But as luck would have it, passing 100K was only the second most fortunate thing to happen
1500880	1502640	to me that year.
1502640	1507560	Because at around the same time, I got a little message in my YouTube dashboard saying that
1507560	1511220	I'd been approved for monetization.
1511220	1516560	This was something for me that didn't even seem like it should have been on the table.
1516560	1520960	And it would absolutely never happen today.
1520960	1525320	During this whole time so far and getting all those millions and millions of views,
1525320	1530460	I had never actually earned a cent of revenue for myself.
1530460	1534860	It was all complimentary for the fans, you know.
1534860	1540040	My motivation with YouTube at the time was never about making money.
1540040	1545560	And based on the type of videos I was making, it wasn't something you could do regardless.
1545560	1553220	And it really never occurred to me until that moment that YouTube could actually be a viable
1553220	1554940	career choice.
1554940	1559020	It's just really funny because every couple of years or so when I was starting to lose
1559020	1565140	motivation, YouTube would just throw me a bone to keep me in the game.
1565140	1570680	And here was another one, just YouTube offering me free money on a silver platter.
1570680	1573660	It's pretty crazy how it happened that way.
1573660	1578740	Looking back, I feel like I just had to be in the perfect place at the perfect time for
1578740	1581360	the stars to align in that way.
1581360	1584340	But what do you know?
1584340	1586900	YouTube works in mysterious ways.
1586900	1591560	And all of a sudden, I had a whole new purpose for making videos.
1591560	1598460	I had a lot of new priorities, initiatives that I wanted to try out with my channel.
1598460	1603660	But I just wasn't quite ready to take that step.
1603660	1608920	For the moment, I actually went back to making YouTube poops, sort of like how I used to
1608920	1612060	make them right when I started.
1612060	1617760	I mean, I stopped caring so much about what the final product would be, and I just sort
1617760	1621220	of put a video together and put it out.
1621220	1627020	I think mentally, I just tried to go back, back to a time when all this stuff was just
1627020	1633780	still intrinsically fun for me, where the act of making the video in and of itself was
1633780	1636060	where the value came from.
1636060	1643300	But of course, at this stage in my career, it couldn't possibly go back to exactly how
1643300	1645060	it was.
1645060	1653140	And YouTube viewers, 95% of the time, all they really want is one type of thing done
1653140	1655300	one sort of way.
1655300	1660660	And my viewers at the time wanted an eight and a half minute YouTube poop about a Pixar
1660660	1661660	movie.
1661660	1665180	And when I stopped delivering, they stopped tuning in.
1665300	1671660	So as I started releasing these new, more experimental YouTube poops, the views started
1671660	1674940	dwindling downward.
1674940	1680140	The thing about success on YouTube is that it's oftentimes fragile.
1680140	1684780	One year you can feel like you're just on top of the world, but anyone who's been in
1684780	1691300	the game long enough will tell you that it can all go away like that.
1691340	1696740	I'm not one of these people whose self-worth is intrinsically tied to how many people are
1696740	1698380	watching them on the internet.
1698380	1702740	It really didn't make that much of a difference to me.
1702740	1709900	What did start to bother me at that point was the comment section.
1709900	1711780	It started off with just a few.
1711780	1715680	Go to any comment section on YouTube and you'll find them.
1715680	1720580	But as time went on and I kept putting out these videos that most of the audience didn't
1720580	1726220	care for, that vocal minority started to grow a lot.
1726220	1729740	And you know, I was someone who was perceptive to it.
1729740	1733700	I used to read every single comment I got.
1733700	1741460	Every day, every time I'd log into YouTube, I'd go to the comments tab and read them all.
1741460	1743180	I don't do it anymore.
1743180	1748820	It's just, it's just too much mentally to deal with.
1748820	1753980	Especially once the audience grew to a point where it was just thousands and thousands
1753980	1757140	of people sharing their opinions.
1757140	1765440	I don't think that the human mind was designed to deal with this many people talking to you.
1765440	1767900	But back then, I stuck through it.
1767900	1771700	That was like the lifeline to me with the audience.
1771700	1777900	I find prestige in entertaining an audience of people.
1777900	1784220	And the comment section, that's the primary means of communication for expressing whether
1784220	1787620	or not a viewer was entertained.
1787620	1788740	So it meant a lot to me.
1788740	1791820	It meant more than the views and the money.
1791820	1794340	Numbers, they're just numbers.
1794340	1796180	You can count them all day.
1796180	1800260	But it's the human element of the comment section.
1800260	1804140	That is the sauce that really ties everything together.
1804140	1811500	But for as much as I extol the meaningfulness of reading the comments, sometimes you encounter
1811500	1815900	those moments when it's just an absolute bitch.
1815900	1822100	I think the final turning point for me was when I decided to make The Simpsons green.
1822100	1824940	I really liked working on this video.
1824940	1829620	I considered it one of the best videos I'd made in over a year.
1829620	1835700	This video for me epitomized everything about why I was inspired to make these videos in
1835700	1837260	the first place.
1837260	1838260	It may seem stupid.
1838260	1846980	It may seem very dumb to get sentimental over videos as ultimately stupid as YouTube poops
1846980	1847980	are.
1847980	1850140	But at this point, it was 2016.
1850140	1856380	It was almost six years of my life, thousands of hours of my free time dedicated to making
1856380	1858020	these videos.
1858020	1862940	And sure, everyone else may call it stupid, but these videos and the process of making
1862940	1865980	them were meaningful to me.
1865980	1869740	Green Simpsons was meaningful to me.
1869740	1875340	But that day, the comment section didn't agree.
1875340	1886780	God, after a while, it's just like, can you people just get off my damn back?
1886820	1888940	Jesus Christ, man.
1888940	1890980	I make these videos for fun.
1890980	1896300	I put these videos out for years for all of you to enjoy for free.
1896300	1901420	And then I make one or two that you don't like and all of a sudden it's this big problem
1901420	1906420	and you have to make it my problem.
1906420	1910740	I just complain after complain after complain.
1910740	1912340	And it wasn't all of them.
1912340	1915860	It wasn't even a majority of them.
1915860	1924540	But it was a level of bitching unlike anything I had ever personally experienced before.
1924540	1928180	I mean, making YouTube poops is all about fun.
1928180	1930380	It's supposed to be fun.
1930380	1935900	Well, I wasn't having fun anymore.
1935900	1939380	You know, I really tried.
1939380	1945440	I really tried to just kind of graciously ride off into the sunset.
1945440	1952200	But the circumstances were such where that wasn't going to happen.
1952200	1953880	I took it hard.
1953880	1955680	I took it really hard.
1955680	1958280	I was very upset.
1958280	1965560	I had never been this upset before making YouTube videos.
1965560	1968280	I just couldn't believe what I was seeing.
1968280	1975680	These people who had just enjoyed this content I made for years that I put out for free to
1975680	1978560	just turn on me like that.
1978560	1986120	It really just threw a wrench into my whole philosophy of where I derive enjoyment from
1986120	1987760	making videos.
1987760	1990840	I used to think it was all about the fans.
1990840	1993120	All about pleasing them.
1993120	2000400	Not only were they displeased, but now I had become displeased.
2000400	2008120	And again, I apologize if I'm being overly corny or sentimental by saying this, but back
2008120	2016420	then YouTube poop and making YouTube videos, that was one of the only things that I really
2016420	2017420	liked doing.
2017900	2023900	It was one of the only things that I considered myself good at.
2023900	2027580	It was as big a part of my life as anything else.
2027580	2032180	And my oh so beloved audience took it away from me.
2032180	2036860	They made it so that I couldn't enjoy it anymore.
2036860	2041540	And upon realizing that, something in me changed.
2041540	2050980	And that right there was the moment that Emperor Lemon died and was replaced by Emplemon.
2050980	2055020	I'm sensing a lot of anger from this time period.
2055020	2057140	Yeah.
2057140	2059980	And how did that make you feel?
2059980	2061780	Angry.
2061780	2068300	God, people are always wondering when exactly the downward spiral began.
2068300	2073220	I think that this moment right here is a pretty good candidate for when.
2073220	2079220	I mean the whole story before this, you could pick and choose times when you think I'm in
2079220	2081420	the downward spiral.
2081420	2087140	But after this happened, I am without question in the downward spiral.
2087140	2094460	I think it was six years to the day of when I first opened my YouTube channel when I uploaded
2094460	2097000	the We Need to Talk video.
2097000	2102380	With that being said, I have a lot of stuff I really need to get off of my chest.
2102380	2108600	The way I see it, these people had bitched and moaned and complained and ruined my day.
2108600	2111560	And now it was my turn.
2111560	2118400	I don't need people to boss me around about fucking YouTube poops where the entire fucking
2118400	2121680	purpose is to get away from that bullshit.
2121680	2122680	I'll show you complaining.
2122680	2127200	I'll show you the best complaining that anyone has ever seen.
2127200	2131240	I will make an entire career out of complaining.
2131240	2135840	If you're one of these people with the fucking delusion to think that I will listen to your
2135840	2139560	hackneyed demands, you need to unsubscribe from this channel right now.
2139560	2143960	I don't want you subscribed.
2143960	2150600	You know, they say you shouldn't do this in all the little YouTube advice tutorial videos
2150600	2159640	that you find from some Indian guy who hasn't even managed to crack 10,000 subscribers.
2159640	2167080	It's not part of the pre-composed YouTube tips to make an entire video snapping on your
2167080	2170360	audience and telling them how much you hate them.
2170360	2174080	Oh, I'm sorry, is it not fun enough for you?
2174080	2175320	Too bad.
2175320	2179120	I stopped having fun a long time ago.
2179120	2182360	Send me the crap below 100,000 again.
2182360	2185880	At least it would remind me of a time when the shit was still fun.
2185880	2193240	YouTube, whatever it is at this point, is clearly not about having fun anymore.
2193240	2196640	That day, I made it very, very clear.
2196640	2202100	I'm not going to be pushed around by the whims of this audience anymore.
2202100	2208560	Any video you see on the future of this channel, it won't be because of you.
2208560	2212520	It won't be for you.
2212520	2218440	It was a mistake to care so much about them.
2218440	2222040	I never really have since.
2222040	2224220	People unsubbed.
2224220	2226680	People stopped watching.
2226680	2227880	Views went down.
2227880	2230340	Revenue went down.
2230340	2232880	I didn't care.
2232880	2236560	I'd been happy making videos for no viewers.
2236560	2241080	I'd been happy making videos for no money.
2241080	2247320	You had people coming out saying that I was done, that I would never amount to anything,
2247320	2252900	that I'd bow out of YouTube and quit, and they'd dance on my grave for having the audacity
2252900	2257920	to lash out against the oh-so-prestigious audience.
2257920	2258960	And you know what?
2258960	2263400	It was probably very reasonable for them to believe that.
2263440	2270840	People didn't do what I just did, but that was the road I traveled.
2270840	2273760	It was time to stick with it.
2273760	2278260	The summer of 2016, I made all sorts of videos.
2278260	2283160	It was the most varied my content had been and probably ever will be.
2283160	2288360	I'd been wanting to branch out and try new videos for a while, but it was this moment
2288360	2293800	in rejecting the fans that truly pushed me into it.
2293800	2297000	Because as for the channel, I hit the reset button.
2297000	2301640	I pretty much took the old channel, burnt it to the ground, and built a new one out
2301640	2303360	of the ashes.
2303360	2307360	The views at one point got very lean.
2307360	2314040	There was a period where I'd upload a video and it would only get 10,000 views.
2314040	2320480	Pretty much a 99% decline, 99 out of 100 people had stopped watching me.
2320480	2327600	There would be entire months during that summer when I had negative subscriber growth.
2327600	2332320	Pretty much every video I'd upload, I would lose subscribers.
2332320	2337200	Not very healthy-looking metrics for a growing channel.
2337200	2338420	But you know what?
2338420	2340340	I didn't care.
2340340	2345760	For the first time in what felt like forever, I actually had the freedom to work on what
2345760	2348260	I wanted to make.
2348260	2354800	In confronting this taboo of not trying to screw with the audience, I ended up overcoming
2354800	2357700	this fear of losing them.
2357700	2359580	It was a mutual departure.
2359580	2362780	I didn't need them and they didn't need me.
2362780	2367380	It's just the reality of making content online.
2367380	2369960	People come and people go.
2369960	2377540	It was a strange time to be an M.Plemon fan, but those few people who stuck around, well,
2377540	2381140	they were in for quite a ride.
2381140	2386660	So 2016 was a pretty tumultuous year for me, personally.
2386660	2392340	I'd have to say that if I look back at every single year in my life, that was probably
2392340	2397260	the one year in which I had the most personal change.
2397260	2402380	But hey, you know, just because I'm on a downward spiral, it doesn't mean everything
2402380	2404340	else has to be.
2404340	2410500	And if there was one saving grace of 2016, it was that there was all of a sudden plenty
2410500	2422620	of great stuff to watch on YouTube.
2422620	2430580	To this day, I always maintain that 2016 was the best year for YouTube content.
2430580	2435340	Basically in this year, you saw people become legends.
2435340	2445040	Filthy Frank, iDubbbz, Keemstar, Leafy, even H3H3 at this point was making good videos.
2445040	2452600	I see posts in the modern age, trying to write off this era as being just unnecessarily
2452600	2461720	edgy or trying too hard or having a detrimental influence on whatever future generation you
2461720	2463680	may consider.
2463680	2468440	These guys deserved the success they achieved.
2468440	2476820	They pushed the boundaries harder than any other group of YouTubers before or since.
2476820	2481720	The content produced during this time was just simply at another level.
2481720	2488820	It may seem sappy to talk about it this way, to be so reverent over what was essentially
2488820	2494040	just a bunch of guys goofing around and starting drama with each other.
2494040	2500480	But you'd be hard pressed to find another period of YouTube history that was more interesting
2500480	2501480	and more dynamic.
2501480	2509160	It was just a time when people were just so free and unafraid to push the needle.
2509160	2515040	In hindsight, knowing what was coming next, we probably should have been a little bit
2515040	2516820	more afraid.
2516820	2520900	These guys were truly influential and they influenced me.
2520900	2525220	I got to see what was possible on YouTube.
2525220	2531060	And towards the end of 2016, I was finally starting to get a little bit of momentum back
2531060	2532060	on my side.
2532060	2537340	I remember at the end of the year, I came out with the empty subscribers video and then
2537340	2540980	the top 10 dank memes of 2016.
2540980	2547580	And these were pretty much the first proto M.Plemon videos of the modern age, where I
2547580	2554500	actually sat down, wrote a script, recorded, and edited a complete product.
2554500	2559340	I remember at the end of 2016, I hit a very big personal milestone.
2559340	2564940	I had my first $1,000 month on YouTube.
2564940	2571300	And it gave me a slight glimmer of hope that I could continue this into the future.
2571300	2576180	You know, after all this strife and all this turmoil, the channel wasn't dead yet.
2576180	2578940	There's still a little bit of life left in it.
2578940	2584580	There were still new people tuning in, new growth to be had.
2584580	2589340	It was basically a new channel with a new audience and a new direction, but things were
2589340	2590500	looking up.
2590500	2593820	It seemed like it was going to get easier.
2593820	2599360	Little did I know just how foolish it was to place that much faith in YouTube.
2599360	2604260	Just when they pull you back in, it seems like every single thing conspires against
2604260	2606500	you to push you out.
2606500	2614620	God, man, 2017, what an awful year to be on YouTube.
2614620	2615620	It had to have been the worst.
2615620	2621140	It had to have been the worst year in YouTube history.
2621140	2626700	I know there's a lot of new people in the YouTube space who weren't around back then,
2626700	2636040	but if you ask people who were, people like me, they will get legitimate PTSD flashbacks
2636040	2642500	at how putrid of a year that was to make content on YouTube.
2642500	2648540	It all started from just some article from some douchebag journalist whose name doesn't
2648540	2650540	even deserve to be mentioned.
2650540	2652420	He's just complete garbage.
2652420	2656140	He writes this whole article for the Wall Street Journal about how he found some Coca-Cola
2656140	2659300	ads on a Johnny Rebel song.
2659300	2665260	Never you mind the fact that the Titanic music companies that basically almost tried to bully
2665260	2671380	YouTube out of existence in the first place, they manually claim and run ads on all these
2671380	2672460	songs.
2672460	2674820	That's the reason there's ads on it.
2674820	2677420	Didn't show up to the guy in the article for some reason.
2677420	2680860	No, it's YouTube's fault.
2680860	2689140	And Coca-Cola and PepsiCo, they can't be bothered to have their product alongside such raucous,
2689140	2690820	inappropriate content.
2690820	2692380	Oh no.
2692380	2698940	So that marked the opportunity for basically them and a lot of other Fortune 500 companies
2698940	2702940	to pull their ads out of YouTube entirely.
2702940	2709220	So you know how I had my first thousand dollar month in the December of 2016 or so.
2709220	2715340	I think by March, my monthly earnings for the entire channel was under a hundred.
2715340	2720900	I was basically making enough money off of my channel in those months to go to the grocery
2720900	2723340	store two times.
2723340	2726080	Thanks for the tens of thousands of views.
2726080	2727980	This is what you're worth now.
2727980	2734840	And this is what every YouTuber was worth now that didn't make squeaky clean, brand
2734840	2736580	friendly content.
2737060	2742060	Man, hearing all that makes me glad I chose a profession in psychiatric help.
2742060	2747540	Seems like every passing year, business just keeps going up.
2747540	2754860	Just old, dying dinosaur media who no longer have the interest to have pissed away all
2754860	2757820	the goodwill of the audience they once had.
2757820	2764200	It's their lone, dying clutches to maintain the last scrap of relevancy they could.
2764200	2769960	They saw all the audiences turning off the TV, cutting the cable cord and going to YouTube
2769960	2773280	to enjoy better content for free.
2773280	2775800	And they weren't willing to go down without a fight.
2775800	2781440	These companies, they had their chance to come into YouTube graciously, but they did
2781440	2782840	not choose to do so.
2782840	2789420	And I will always have a chip on my shoulder against them because of how they acted coming
2789420	2790420	in here.
2790420	2793960	YouTubers, man, I mean, we built this platform.
2793960	2801360	We worked for free for years, making content for people that was more compelling, more
2801360	2807580	interesting and more personal than anything you guys were putting out.
2807580	2814000	It could have come in graciously, but no, they wanted to come in and call the shots.
2814000	2819000	The YouTube trending tab, pretty much a joke now, but there was a time when you could actually
2819000	2824040	find decent and interesting stuff to watch on there from YouTubers.
2824040	2830260	Oh, but then Jimmy Kimmel and Jimmy Fallon and all the late night hosts decide we want
2830260	2837780	our stuff to not only compete in the same space with YouTubers, but we want to be given
2837780	2839520	special treatment.
2839520	2846920	I say it started happening probably around 2015, but it didn't really get obnoxious until
2846920	2849080	2017.
2849080	2856580	Late night TV show clips, you had to get them all in, all represented, big budget mainstream
2856580	2863140	movie trailers, big budget mainstream music videos from top 40 artists.
2863140	2868600	This was the content that was now the face of YouTube, or at least they were trying to
2868600	2870400	make it that way.
2870400	2876380	And of course, when the adpocalypse hits and all the actual homegrown native YouTubers
2876380	2883840	get absolutely slaughtered, all these companies just slide in, make themselves comfortable.
2883840	2886200	Of course, their ad rates never took a hit.
2886200	2891480	It was only us, the common man, the common YouTuber, the whole reason that motivates
2891480	2897460	you to get up and make content because it's achievable for us.
2897460	2903880	It's never achievable for you to become Jimmy Kimmel or for you to become a top 40 artist
2903880	2907720	with million dollar budget music videos.
2907720	2909380	That's the appeal of YouTube.
2909380	2915580	The idea that we, the common man, are making the content and we don't have to rely on million
2915580	2919460	dollar venture capitalist industry shills.
2919460	2924780	We don't need to rely on the whim of some old crotchety 80 year old producer who thinks
2924780	2928400	he knows what young people want to watch.
2928400	2932780	These companies, when given the chance early on, they tried to kill YouTube.
2932780	2938260	They tried to squash YouTube into the dust and keep the glass ceiling in place.
2938260	2944460	Keep that division between the regular plebs who should never amount to anything and the
2944460	2950220	golden boys, the mainstream Hollywood, New York City elite.
2950220	2952160	It wasn't a long time ago.
2952160	2958780	It was just 10, 15 years ago when all this stuff was going down and how easy it is for
2958780	2961280	YouTube to forget.
2961280	2966000	Because at the same time that all this homegrown talent that basically built the platform were
2966000	2972200	getting squashed, YouTube basically saw the legacy media that had antagonized us for so
2972200	2978980	long and laid down and said, you guys come on in, make yourselves comfortable.
2978980	2984440	We have no allegiance and no accountability to the very people who built this site.
2984440	2990560	We were basically used to build throne rooms for all these established companies to just
2990560	2996600	come in and sit down on top of us without having to earn a thing.
2996600	3001280	All you mainstream companies who tried to choke us out just a decade ago, you are now
3001280	3004520	the premier face of the entire website.
3004520	3006880	Welcome in.
3006880	3010880	We hope you enjoy your stay.
3010880	3018520	Maybe they did, but for the rest of us, we sure weren't enjoying our time on YouTube.
3018520	3022500	I can't speak for everyone else, but I was sure pissed.
3022500	3026040	I was pissed off at the direction of this website.
3026040	3032280	I felt like there was no longer a premium for making good videos.
3032280	3037520	It seemed like for a little bit there, YouTube was not just neglecting it, but actively making
3037520	3043140	the site inhospitable for interesting and dynamic content.
3043140	3049220	And for me, the abject downfall in the quality of YouTube content came to be embodied by
3049220	3050820	one channel.
3050820	3053900	It was a channel by the name of Behind The Meme.
3053900	3058340	Hello internet and welcome to Behind The Meme, where we take a look at the meaning and the
3058340	3060700	origin of your favorite memes.
3060700	3067760	And God, he got a ton of views and his videos were complete shit.
3067760	3075880	It was just awful, terrible, just complete dog shit content, bland, boring, no insight,
3075880	3079400	just like brainless popcorn content.
3079400	3081160	But man, people tuned in.
3081160	3084500	I don't know why they did, but they did.
3084500	3085720	He was on trending.
3085720	3091320	He was getting pushed by the algorithm in everyone's homepage and I could tolerate it
3091320	3095920	for so long until he made a video about YouTube poop.
3095920	3102560	It was one of my most hated videos of all time in my 10 plus years of watching videos
3102560	3104400	on this platform.
3104400	3107220	Just pump out the video for the hell of it.
3107220	3113440	And who the hell cares if you're representing whatever you're talking about correctly or
3113440	3115840	even remotely, informatively?
3115840	3118480	No, no, no.
3118480	3122880	That's just the standard on YouTube that's being promoted at this point.
3122880	3128600	Pump out a bunch of complete shit content and all the stupid idiot viewers will just
3128600	3130440	lick up the slop.
3130440	3131520	And I had had enough of it.
3131520	3135800	I had had enough of seeing the direction of the site.
3135800	3142640	So I basically took years of rage and inflicted it on this one guy.
3142640	3149120	And that was the behind the meme video.
3149120	3154800	About 2016 and much of 2017, it was a big trend on YouTube to start drama.
3154800	3157480	Call someone out and air your beef.
3157480	3159560	Some would call it toxic.
3159560	3161280	Yeah.
3161280	3165200	There's always been toxic content on YouTube.
3165200	3171580	I would call it keeping people honest and accountable and making sure that the overall
3171580	3177440	quality of content on this site doesn't devolve into absolute dog water.
3177440	3184120	This behind the meme guy, people were already sick of him long before I touched the topic.
3184120	3185120	But Hey, you know what?
3185120	3189640	I saw all these people making these call out videos to great success.
3189640	3193680	Now it was my turn to become the content cop.
3193680	3199120	And man, to say that it's my most controversial video would be an understatement.
3199120	3206100	There are people today, five years after the fact who still refuse to watch anything I
3206100	3214260	make because of what they saw me say in that video, there were a lot of people pissed off
3214260	3220060	at what I was saying, but you know, after having my whole audience turn on me in 2016,
3220060	3221840	I was used to it.
3221840	3223340	It didn't really phase me.
3223340	3225700	And you know, they had their reasons.
3225700	3230340	The criticism I got from that video was not unwarranted.
3230340	3236140	There's a lot of stuff said in that video that was pushing the limits of acceptability.
3236140	3240300	Do I regret releasing the behind the meme video?
3240300	3245500	Well, I can say it was definitely a lot more trouble than it was worth.
3245500	3247980	I did gain quite a few new fans from that.
3247980	3253100	It was probably my first million view video since the YouTube Poop era.
3253100	3256940	It was kind of like opening a Pandora's box of sorts.
3256980	3262620	I had never made a video before that going so hard after one individual channel.
3262620	3268140	And I didn't really anticipate my audience who had been mostly indifferent with anything
3268140	3270820	I'd made for the past year and a half.
3270820	3277440	I wasn't really expecting them to be so emboldened with what I was saying and to really go after
3277440	3283940	this guy and just hammer him for weeks and months after the fact.
3283940	3287760	It caused a lot of heartache, a lot of strife, a lot of anger.
3287760	3289980	But do I regret putting it out?
3289980	3290980	I don't really know.
3290980	3296920	I think to say I regretted it would be like to say that whole part of my development on
3296920	3299340	YouTube didn't matter.
3299340	3302140	I could try to play it off as much as I want.
3302140	3308900	But at the end of the day, I know deep down that I meant what I said in that video.
3308900	3315060	In my mindset and my mental state at that time and my anger towards the direction of
3315060	3320460	this website, that video wasn't going to turn out any other way.
3320460	3323520	It was a product of its time, no doubt.
3323520	3328680	If I could do it over knowing what I know today, then yeah, I probably would have done
3328680	3331620	things a bit differently in that video.
3331620	3337860	That video, whether you like it or not, that was simply the next stepping stone in my development.
3337860	3343200	And I wouldn't be in the position I am today had it not been for the mistakes I learned
3343200	3344200	from that video.
3344200	3353860	But you know, I made my drama video and I had a tension that I had not had since 2014 or 2015.
3353860	3359320	After releasing that video, I definitely turned over a new chapter of the downward spiral.
3359320	3364220	You know, I complained and bitched and been abrasive and cantankerous for many videos
3364220	3365940	before that.
3365940	3369940	But this was the first one where people actually listened.
3369940	3375840	It was definitely something I had not experienced up until that point in my career.
3375840	3381060	You know, whether they were for or against the video, people were paying attention.
3381060	3385540	People were listening and people were taking it seriously.
3385540	3390900	It was the first time I'd released something out onto the internet and really made people
3390900	3392520	pay attention.
3392520	3398600	It's easy to just watch content online and be aloof and indifferent towards all of it.
3398600	3401560	But this video made people angry.
3401560	3406540	Whether they were angry at me or angry at behind the meme, they cared.
3406540	3413120	It certainly made an impression on me to basically take all these people and rile them up.
3413120	3418380	It was power and agency that I suddenly had in my hands.
3418380	3424020	And over the course of the next year, I was definitely experimenting to see how far I
3424020	3426660	could push it.
3426660	3431880	Don't you think that it's a little hypocritical to complain about being badgered by your audience
3431880	3435420	just to turn around and do the very same thing to Behind the Meme?
3435420	3438220	Well, let's not mince words here, alright?
3438220	3440740	The content was piss poor.
3440740	3442140	There's no getting around it.
3442140	3444660	And yours wasn't?
3444660	3450140	I guess the difference for me is that I was trying to make good videos.
3450140	3453420	I never got the impression that he was.
3453420	3459680	You know, there's very little separating his stuff from something like BuzzFeed or WatchMojo.
3459680	3462920	Just a bland, soulless content farm.
3462920	3467020	I don't want to hear this revisionist history about how his videos were actually decent
3467020	3468920	because they weren't.
3468920	3473340	Just because you feel sorry for the guy doesn't change that.
3473380	3475300	Did Behind the Meme deserve to be criticized?
3475300	3478300	Absolutely.
3478300	3484780	But I'll acknowledge that at some points, perhaps the criticism went a little too far.
3484780	3490740	Well, don't you feel at least a little sympathy for the role that you played in it?
3490740	3494300	You know, the way some people retell it, it was like I literally sent people out there
3494300	3495940	to go harass the guy.
3495940	3497060	Let's set the record straight.
3497060	3498780	That never happened.
3498780	3501580	That was never my intent.
3501580	3502860	Did the hate go too far?
3502860	3503860	Yes.
3503860	3504860	Okay, yeah, I think so.
3504860	3506140	I'll admit it.
3506140	3509620	And after a while, I did start to feel bad for the guy.
3509620	3514940	It's part of the reason why I've since tried to distance my content from YouTube drama.
3514940	3518220	Because after a certain point, it's just not worth it.
3518220	3521860	It just becomes too exhausting.
3521860	3523260	And I get it, you know.
3523260	3525340	There's enough problems in the world.
3525340	3528420	Why create another one?
3528420	3532820	At the time, that was the video I wanted to make.
3532820	3540220	But it wouldn't be long before I would start holding myself to a higher standard.
3540220	3546580	I think at this point, it's important to reiterate that I still wasn't planning to do YouTube
3546580	3548140	full time.
3548140	3552960	There was maybe a brief moment six months earlier when I was considering it.
3552960	3559540	But in the middle of 2017, YouTube was basically on the verge of financial ruin for the vast
3559540	3562140	majority of its creators.
3562140	3566900	And it didn't exactly look promising for the future.
3566900	3568540	It was a really rough time.
3568540	3575140	Probably the worst time in the past 10 years to try to earn a living off of YouTube.
3575140	3580220	I'm not exactly the type of person you'd consider to be a strategic optimist.
3580220	3584020	I'm not someone who sits around hoping that things magically get better.
3584020	3589620	No, the way I do things, I'm always really perceptive of the realities of how things
3589620	3592240	are in the current moment.
3592240	3596420	And in that moment, YouTube did not look like the way to go.
3596420	3601900	I'd resolved within myself that I would use the supplemental income that YouTube provided.
3601900	3606580	But that there would come a point in the near future where I would have to abandon YouTube
3606580	3610580	and enter the workforce and get a conventional job.
3610580	3616740	And the whole point of mentioning this is to reiterate that even as recently as 2017,
3616740	3622660	I was still not fully committed to putting YouTube in my future.
3622660	3626600	And that definitely affected how I ran the channel at the time.
3626600	3629780	Because quite simply, I wasn't building for the future.
3629780	3632820	I didn't see my future on YouTube.
3632820	3638300	And there were moments back then where I was basically planning to flame out and just squeeze
3638300	3642940	as much goodwill and attention out of this channel that I possibly could have before
3642940	3647300	I inevitably crashed it into the ground.
3647300	3654940	I remember that summer of 2017, the state of the website just continued to deteriorate.
3654940	3659900	The infamous demonetization system was starting to get rolled out.
3659900	3662820	And it was pushed out long before it was ready.
3662820	3665340	And it was just a total mess.
3665340	3671220	It was a time when you couldn't even touch a sensitive topic without your video turning
3671220	3677880	yellow and your potential revenue being slashed 60-70%.
3677880	3678880	It was awful.
3678880	3680460	It was just paralyzing.
3680460	3682060	You couldn't do anything.
3682060	3688040	You couldn't take the slightest risk without being in just financial ruin.
3688040	3692560	So much effort being spent on videos that was just all for naught.
3692560	3697860	And when they demonetized your video, they wouldn't just take away your revenue.
3697860	3700220	And they tried to deny this for the longest time.
3700220	3705820	But after enough experience from everybody, it was just indisputable.
3705820	3710900	You would not only get less revenue, you would get less views and less exposure.
3710900	3717780	And after enough people saw how their videos did while monetized versus demonetized.
3717780	3720140	It was a night and day difference.
3720140	3726260	YouTube tried to pretend that it wasn't there, but everyone caught on.
3726260	3728380	There was no hiding it.
3728380	3734800	And there was a lot of adaptation that was forced on by these monumental changes.
3734800	3739380	Content as a whole was forced to be less interesting and less inspiring.
3739380	3746140	It's just like everything got forced into this bottleneck of being bland, safe, and
3746140	3750300	just totally unwilling to step on anyone's toes.
3750300	3755680	I'd be damned if I wasn't just dismayed seeing every day on this website people neutering
3755680	3758760	their content to adhere to their guidelines.
3758760	3764600	And I had initially placed my frustrations on a guy like Behind The Meme.
3764600	3770560	I took all this frustration of YouTube basically burning down in front of my eyes and pinned
3770560	3772880	it on one guy.
3772880	3778180	And it didn't take long for me to see how that was a little unfair.
3778180	3783480	And how my anger and resentment should have been placed somewhere else.
3783480	3787760	And so I shifted my focus to YouTube.
3787760	3793520	Some may have called it awfully arrogant of me to do so, biting the hand that feeds.
3793520	3800120	People pointed out how it was awfully hypocritical of me to direct all this hate towards YouTube.
3800120	3805200	I wouldn't have cared so much if deep down I didn't love YouTube.
3805200	3807760	And that was really the honest fact of the matter.
3807760	3810260	I loved YouTube.
3810260	3815720	And I saw this thing I loved probably more than anything else in my life gradually just
3815720	3819400	decay into a shell of its former self.
3819400	3822180	And it was extremely disheartening to me.
3822180	3826780	So I released the video, YouTube has been on a downward spiral.
3826780	3831380	And pretty much everything in there just comes straight from the heart.
3831380	3838780	You know I never had any intentions to damage YouTube or to cause the site to fail at my
3838780	3840420	hands.
3840420	3845380	For me it was just a means of saying like, what are we doing?
3845380	3851700	What have we done with this place that was once so beautiful and robust and just a sanctuary
3851700	3859300	for independent creators to make these low budget creative works and express themselves.
3859300	3861300	This is what YouTube was all about.
3861300	3865820	You could broadcast yourself and then look what we've become.
3865820	3868220	I had a lot of pain for sure.
3868220	3874580	And it was almost like I wanted to make everyone else feel as upset and betrayed as I was.
3874580	3879020	And for a lot of people, yeah, that video was very upsetting, but I think a lot of other
3879020	3885500	people felt vindicated that someone was finally stepping up and speaking their mind on a lot
3885500	3891540	of these issues that they were thinking but were perhaps too timid to bring to light.
3891540	3896820	And it was all of a sudden with this video where I felt like I had a greater purpose.
3896820	3901400	Where it was no longer about hedonistically and selfishly just putting videos out there
3901400	3905180	and getting views and revenue for myself.
3905180	3911560	I felt like I was now speaking on behalf of the greater YouTube community.
3911560	3914460	And you know I wore that as a badge of honor.
3914460	3920800	You could call it virtue signaling or grandstanding or whatever, but I really felt good being
3920800	3922360	in that role.
3922360	3927340	Being sort of the mouthpiece for all these other misfortunate creators who got sacrificed
3927340	3928700	for the system.
3928700	3935220	For a moment I just really reveled in being the guy to speak the honest truth of the situation
3935220	3939100	and not worry about what would happen to my channel.
3939100	3944600	And I was ready at that point to basically ride off into the sunset until YouTube kicked
3944600	3945600	me off.
3945600	3946600	I didn't care.
3946600	3949940	I was dealing with something that was bigger than me.
3949940	3954200	And yeah, maybe it was arrogant of me and maybe there were points when I was in over
3954200	3955200	my head.
3955200	3959760	But it was definitely a fire that was lit underneath me that was making me more motivated
3959760	3962760	than at any time that I could remember.
3962760	3968000	So towards the end of the year, I start really trying hard on these videos.
3968000	3973300	I really start putting a lot of effort into the editing and the writing and the pacing.
3973300	3976980	Trying to basically make the best product that I could make.
3976980	3982300	I pretty much wanted to prove to everyone else and myself that I could.
3982300	3987220	That my videos could be in the same league as the best of the best on this website.
3987220	3991900	And so I started working on what was probably my most ambitious project to date.
3991900	3996220	The video that would eventually become the Donald Trump meme theory.
3996220	4002040	And looking back, this was probably the very first video that I would consider to be in
4002040	4005220	the modern M.Plemon era.
4005220	4010820	I remember this was the first written video where I finished it and was able to look back
4010820	4013180	on it with some kind of pride.
4013180	4015520	And I always remember what happened next.
4015520	4019660	I remember I posted it and it was up for about a day.
4019660	4026300	And then, within probably a few hours, it got demonetized and copyright claimed.
4026300	4029620	And I was completely discouraged.
4029620	4033660	And for me, for a while, that was pretty much the final straw.
4033660	4040860	I mean, I had this video that was like the first video that I was really and truly proud of.
4040860	4046540	And I do all this work just to put it up there and basically get the ultimate middle finger from YouTube.
4046540	4049860	You can put in all this effort and people can watch and like it.
4049860	4054940	But at the end of the day, your kind is basically not welcome here.
4054940	4060160	And me continuing to try to give the site a chance and give it the benefit of the doubt,
4060160	4062220	I was done.
4062220	4066520	I was not going to tolerate this disrespect anymore.
4066520	4070140	And I was ready to just straight up quit right there.
4070140	4074640	I typed up what was basically a resignation letter from YouTube.
4074640	4080800	And I was ready to put it up as just one last final fuck you to my YouTube career.
4080800	4085040	And I fully believe I would have gone through with it and just quit that day.
4085040	4092000	But you know, this strange thing about YouTube, throughout my entire career, just when I was
4092000	4097600	ready to leave every time, something pulled me back in.
4097600	4102060	So I had appealed the copyright claim and I'd appealed the demonetization.
4102060	4104740	And thus far, I didn't have very good luck with it.
4104740	4110220	But lo and behold, right as I was about to go put together this video of me quitting,
4110220	4116140	I refreshed the video manager to see the green dollar sign looking at me again.
4116140	4121780	And man, that was one of the most surreal moments I've ever had on this website.
4121780	4127620	It was almost like a moment of divine intervention, where I'd been taken to the absolute darkest
4127620	4130540	place I'd ever been on YouTube.
4130540	4135380	And one tiny glimmer of light came through.
4135380	4136860	And I took it as a sign.
4136860	4141540	I took it as a sign to say that my time here isn't up just yet.
4141540	4145200	I have a little bit more business to attend to.
4145200	4150820	Two weeks after that moment, YouTube announces YouTube Rewind for 2017.
4150820	4154900	And something about that just really didn't sit right with me.
4155260	4162180	I mean, for a year as punishing as 2017 was to just most of the talent on the website,
4162180	4168100	how tone deaf do you have to be to put on this whole glamorous end of the year celebration?
4168100	4172760	As if all the strife and struggle you put your users through during the entire year
4172760	4174600	just didn't matter.
4174600	4177180	Like you were just sweeping it all under the rug.
4177180	4183100	So I come up with this little document, basically saying how YouTube has screwed over and mistreated
4183100	4185740	its creators for the entire year.
4185740	4191740	And how we as YouTubers should basically protest all of this mistreatment by going to YouTube
4191740	4194180	Rewind and pressing dislike.
4194180	4197940	And YouTube Rewind starts getting a lot of dislikes.
4197940	4203700	It was getting to a point where it was like a top 50, top 25 most disliked video in history.
4203700	4208580	I don't really know how much of it I can personally take credit for.
4208580	4210980	But one thing was definitely for sure.
4210980	4215400	And it was that I was not alone in being pissed off at YouTube.
4215400	4218020	And YouTube, of course, caught wind of it.
4218020	4222740	They saw that YouTube Rewind was getting an abnormal amount of dislikes.
4222740	4229280	And they saw that a lot of it could be traced back to me, a guy who had made a post instigating
4229280	4230800	people to do so.
4230800	4235880	I never got any official word that this was the case, of course.
4235880	4239660	But by this point, I had lots of friends in the community.
4239660	4245100	When I heard some stuff through the grapevine, they singled me out as the guy who had led
4245100	4247700	the campaign against YouTube Rewind.
4247700	4252260	And I don't think it's overtly paranoid for me to say that for the next year or so on
4252260	4256000	the website, I definitely felt like a target.
4256000	4260100	I definitely felt like YouTube was putting the screws to me.
4260100	4264740	There would be times when I'd upload a video and there'd be absolutely nothing wrong with
4264740	4265740	it.
4265740	4268380	And it would still get demonetized.
4268380	4273900	You could show that video to a hundred people and none of them would find anything objectionable
4273900	4275040	in it.
4275040	4279620	But I put it up and within a minute, it would be demonetized.
4279620	4282100	You guys want to make it this difficult, fine.
4282100	4284100	I'll play ball.
4284100	4286340	I'm not afraid to be a martyr.
4286340	4287560	I'll follow the rules.
4287560	4294600	I'll follow all the guidelines you need just to prove that you guys are screwing with me.
4294600	4299000	So this was actually the point in the channel where I started making my more professional
4299000	4301000	looking series.
4301000	4305540	Series that I intentionally designed to be a bit more polished and a bit more accessible
4305540	4307480	for general audiences.
4307480	4312640	It was basically just me proving to YouTube that I was capable of acting as professionally
4312640	4314200	as anyone else.
4314200	4319260	And that all these problems they were giving me were simply out of their own prerogative.
4319260	4325120	And I swear to this day that for a while there, something was definitely up.
4325120	4330800	My channel was definitely on some kind of list, but you know, by this point around the
4330800	4338260	summer of 2018, I kind of been on my anti YouTube war path for a year and a half now.
4338260	4343080	And it was fun for a little bit to keep up this persona of Mr. Rant.
4343080	4347660	But after a while, you just start to run out of gas.
4347660	4352920	Sometimes people have made very long and lucrative careers out of being the guy who complains
4352920	4355100	about whatever topic.
4355100	4357260	And I don't have anything against it.
4357260	4358760	More power to them.
4358760	4361460	It's not easy to consistently succeed on YouTube.
4361460	4366500	And if you can find a formula to do so, then that's good for you.
4366500	4372560	But after being the bitchy complaint guy for so long, I started to realize that I just
4372560	4374920	can't keep this up forever.
4375100	4381200	And just being angry and disgruntled all the time, surprise, surprise, it wasn't making
4381200	4382200	me happy.
4382200	4385720	I mean, YouTube at that point still wasn't getting any better.
4385720	4390600	So it's not like all these complaints were actually amounting to anything.
4390600	4394960	You know, in the moment, it feels real good to get all these people riled up based on
4394960	4401640	something you say, and to basically create this army of people to go out and raise hell.
4401640	4406640	But after a while, it feels like you just run out of things to complain about.
4406640	4411860	And so I thought to myself, instead of wasting all this time and effort and resources complaining
4411860	4417360	about how much YouTube sucks now, wouldn't it be nice if instead you could just be a
4417360	4421520	reason why YouTube doesn't suck?
4421520	4426480	I think there comes a point in every YouTuber's career where you've been around long enough
4426480	4432160	to where you reach this inevitable question of, what am I doing here?
4432160	4434160	What are we doing here?
4434160	4439520	I mean, you can only get so many views and subscribers before it all starts to just fade
4439520	4443020	away into meaningless numbers.
4443020	4447880	After a while, the whole YouTube experience that people think they're getting into just
4447880	4451200	all becomes sort of peripheral.
4451200	4453200	Just a bunch of statistics.
4453200	4458840	No more tangible than the electricity coming out of your computer screen.
4458840	4464300	And so that was kind of the point I was at in mid-2018.
4464300	4470480	For the past five years or so, I'd been motivated by a variety of different factors.
4470480	4475520	It felt like over that whole period, I had been making videos for someone else.
4475520	4480880	Whether I was trying too hard to please the audience or trying too hard to prove a point
4480880	4488520	to them, I was all of a sudden asking myself what I wanted and what I wanted to get out
4488520	4490380	of making videos.
4490380	4494440	From that point on, I pretty much just put my head down and started working on what I
4494440	4497600	thought were good videos.
4497600	4503420	I started turning up the work and the research and the editing to make my stuff something
4503420	4505460	that I could be proud of.
4505460	4509800	I think the real turning point for me was the Leafy video.
4509800	4514400	This was the first time I can remember where I basically just buckled down for an entire
4514400	4520760	month where I just worked my ass off to create this good product.
4520760	4522400	It ended up being quite successful.
4522400	4526440	I got a lot of attention and views and subscribers for it.
4526440	4531080	But the one thing about that video that I found really encouraging was that it felt
4531080	4536680	like the first time I'd used my power on YouTube constructively.
4536680	4541880	Where I'd presented a project so engaging that a lot of people who watched it ended
4541880	4547640	up changing their mind about something that they thought they knew very well.
4547640	4553560	It's often difficult on YouTube to tell whether you're actually good and talented at something
4553560	4560920	or whether your success is just a circumstance of hype and bandwagoning off the latest trend.
4560920	4565360	And with the Leafy video, people were definitely impressed.
4565360	4569020	I could tell that my success was no fluke.
4569020	4571160	I'd put out a good product.
4571160	4576400	And now it was time to use my abilities to make more videos like it.
4576400	4581920	So during the whole time I was making rant videos complaining about how much things sucked,
4581920	4590760	there was sort of this opposite voice welling up in me, wanting to take the opposite approach.
4590760	4596800	Where instead of spending all this time shaming mediocrity, I create a series where I celebrate
4596800	4597800	greatness.
4597800	4603520	I mean, after all, greatness is a lot more special than mediocrity.
4603520	4607760	And part of me for a while felt like it was worth talking about it.
4607760	4612720	So this idea about celebrating excellence eventually turned into my most successful
4612720	4614760	video series to date.
4614760	4622000	Never ever.
4622000	4627960	It's hard to believe that I've only made six episodes so far because its impact has felt
4627960	4630280	much more significant than that.
4630280	4636440	I don't think I originally envisioned the series to be like that, but it ended up becoming
4636440	4638100	quite special.
4638100	4644260	And that was simply a product of each episode's subject being special to me.
4644260	4650260	I ended up going the extra mile to make sure that these topics were treated with the care
4650260	4652680	and respect that they deserved.
4652680	4659020	I was very fortunate that never ever succeeded in the way that it did because it helped transform
4659020	4665220	my channel from this place of rage and negativity into something that was a lot more positive
4665220	4668260	and a lot more pleasant.
4668260	4675420	It definitely inspired a turn for my videos to become a whole lot less cynical and bitter.
4675420	4681420	I mean, you could say whatever you want about these videos, but you have to admit that they
4681420	4682800	have heart.
4682800	4687540	And sometimes on YouTube, that's all people are looking for.
4687540	4691420	A lot of people out there, they don't have it so good.
4691420	4697460	A lot of them come to YouTube wanting really hard to feel something.
4697460	4705420	And I'm glad that my videos have been able to provide that service to so many.
4705420	4713340	So by the end of 2019, I graduated from college and I had a pretty big decision to make.
4713340	4720380	Leading up to it, you would have never guessed that I would have picked YouTube, but I did.
4720420	4726820	I remember looking at my videos and my body of work over the last year and for the first
4726820	4732540	time in my whole career, I was actually impressed with myself.
4732540	4735320	And by this point, my channel was growing again.
4735320	4742980	I had successfully recovered a new audience that were excited and eager to engage with
4742980	4745000	what I was going to put out next.
4745000	4750240	I felt like I was earning a level of respect that I didn't even come close to getting
4750240	4752680	back when I made YouTube poops.
4752680	4753680	Downward spiral.
4753680	4756560	I'm gonna dig straight to hell, gamers.
4756560	4761680	And I think that's what ultimately ended up convincing me to take the leap of faith
4761680	4766400	and actually pursue YouTube full time.
4766400	4772600	It's like at long last, after spending so much time making these videos, I'm finally
4772600	4778580	at a place where I feel like I belong and that the people around me and the people who
4778580	4781580	watch me believe in me.
4781580	4789540	And I think that was enough to finally make me believe in myself.
4789540	4792580	Didn't you and I have a podcast around this time too?
4792580	4794580	Wait, what?
4794580	4796580	Oh, that.
4796580	4805220	Uh, let's just say that there are certain things I'd prefer to leave in the past.
4805220	4810220	You know, for the longest time, I had been treating my YouTube career like I had nothing
4810220	4811500	to lose.
4811500	4818100	And that was honestly how I felt for years because I died the YouTube death.
4818100	4823960	People weren't supposed to come back from losing 99% of their audience.
4823960	4827240	For most YouTubers, that's supposed to be the nail in the coffin.
4827240	4831460	It's basically just the internet telling you to pack up your things and leave.
4831460	4835020	And most people, when they find themselves in that situation, they do.
4835020	4836660	They up and leave.
4836660	4838040	I didn't though.
4838040	4841860	It was like I had been fired and just kept showing up to the office.
4841860	4845580	Pretty much everything that came out of my channel after that point was just supposed
4845580	4847380	to be gravy.
4847380	4851840	It wasn't really supposed to amount to what it did.
4851840	4857300	During that time period, shortly after the downward spiral, I acted brazen for sure.
4857300	4861900	I acted like someone who probably wouldn't have their career much longer because back
4861900	4867020	then, I certainly felt like I didn't need YouTube and that they didn't need me.
4867020	4870460	Well, what a difference a few years can make.
4870460	4873740	My relationship with YouTube certainly changed.
4873740	4881440	All of a sudden, I leveraged a lot on my YouTube success and I could no longer afford to treat
4881440	4884780	it as flippantly as I once was.
4884780	4890280	I was no longer in a position where I could just throw caution at the wind and make whatever
4890280	4898380	video and upload whatever trash and hold the audience in such contempt as I once had.
4898380	4904120	There were a lot more stakes now and for the first time ever, I really needed the channel
4904120	4905780	to succeed.
4905780	4910840	And these high stakes all of a sudden became very apparent just a couple of months after
4910840	4913840	I decided to do YouTube full-time.
4913840	4919880	Of course, in the spring of 2020, COVID hit everything and shut everything down.
4919880	4923240	People in the conventional job market got screwed.
4923240	4929560	They basically got laid off with no means of income for the foreseeable future.
4929560	4934680	All of a sudden, the stable real job that everyone told me would be a sure thing and
4934680	4940360	told me it would be foolish to give up to chase some pipe dream of making YouTube videos
4940360	4945660	for a living, all of a sudden, that didn't look like such a good option.
4945700	4951220	I don't hold it against people for warning me that it was foolish to pursue YouTube because
4951220	4952540	it was.
4952540	4957620	At the time, every single indicator showed that it was a foolish decision.
4957620	4963740	But I just look back at that decision in absolute awe at how things worked out and how so quickly
4963740	4969800	the sure thing white collar cubicle job just became toxic.
4969800	4974220	It felt like being on one of the last life rafts off of the Titanic.
4974220	4980300	It's definitely a strange feeling to get what seems like a lot of breaks in the way that
4980300	4981880	I have.
4981880	4987620	Sometimes it feels like I'm falling into protagonist syndrome with just how fortunate things ended
4987620	4988620	up.
4988620	4994580	Or it's almost like I have this plot armor around me that insists the show must go on.
4994580	4998980	I think back to all those times when I thought about quitting YouTube entirely.
4998980	5001100	And there were many of them.
5001100	5007100	And now I'm probably just going to be doing this and making these videos until I physically
5007100	5009380	cannot anymore.
5009380	5013780	That's not to say it's been entirely smooth sailing, because it hasn't.
5013780	5018820	There were certainly a lot of demons from the past that continued to haunt me.
5018820	5024580	Behind the meme, you know, after I made that video about him, things didn't really work
5024580	5026220	out for the guy.
5026220	5028660	You want to talk about the downward spiral?
5028660	5032460	Well, it probably hit a little too close to home for him.
5032460	5037260	You know, there are a lot of other YouTubers back then who also made videos shitting on
5037260	5042980	the guy, many of whom were way more popular than I was at the time.
5042980	5047380	But no, historically, I'm going to go down as the guy who basically bullied behind the
5047380	5048980	meme into retirement.
5048980	5055580	It might not be exactly fair to see it that way, but I guess it goes to show, out of all
5055580	5061140	those videos made about him, mine was certainly the most persuasive.
5061140	5065900	It seemed like it took a while for my channel to get back in good standing with YouTube
5065900	5069340	after the whole tank the rewind thing.
5069340	5075360	Of course, it probably helped my case that one year after I instigated that whole movement,
5075360	5080780	YouTube released the 2018 rewind that went on to become the most disliked video in YouTube
5080780	5082220	history.
5082220	5088200	I think that kind of took a bit of the heat off of me to sort of show that maybe it was
5088200	5093380	more of a YouTube problem than an M.Plemon problem that the rewind got disliked.
5093380	5100500	And I think whatever bad blood they had for me, they kind of had to excuse it after that.
5100500	5105720	After enough time had passed, the demonetization that was once terrorizing pretty much everything
5105720	5108620	I made, it died down.
5108620	5113260	For the past two years, pretty much, I haven't had a problem with it.
5113260	5118580	I think by far, though, the most punishing sins that continued to follow me around was,
5118580	5121620	of course, the old YouTube poops.
5121620	5126620	By the end of 2017, I pretty much stopped making them entirely.
5126620	5129660	There wasn't really a big goodbye or anything like that.
5129660	5134380	I just sort of made them until I no longer cared to do so.
5134380	5140180	But even though I had pretty clearly left and moved on to greener pastures, I was still
5140180	5144940	getting my fair share of drama and controversy from that scene.
5144940	5150540	It was just like a bunch of ghouls who would just not forgive me for how I exited that
5150540	5151640	community.
5151640	5155160	And after a while, I got sick of it and just called them all out on it.
5155160	5157820	I made it known that I left for a reason.
5157820	5163520	And a lot of these people that just continued bitching for years after I left, they definitely
5163520	5165460	had their hand to play in it.
5165460	5166460	And it sucks.
5166460	5171840	It sucks that I left on such bad terms, but there are certain things you encounter in
5171840	5175400	your life that are just toxic.
5175400	5180840	And it's up to you to remove them and move on to a better place.
5180840	5185580	I think the saddest part of all of it was the YouTube poops themselves.
5185580	5192480	I had moved on from that time period for sure, but it still represented a significant part
5192480	5193840	of my personal history.
5193840	5198360	I mean, it's not something you could just throw away in a race.
5198360	5202980	Those memories of spending all those hours making those videos, they're going to be around
5202980	5205120	as long as I'm around.
5205120	5210600	You know, for as much animosity as I had leaving that community, it still very much shaped
5210600	5213480	the creator that I would eventually become.
5213480	5219760	I'm not one to try to delete videos and obfuscate the past, no matter how unsavory it might
5219760	5221080	be.
5221080	5225280	Many other YouTubers in my position would have deleted them off their channel a while
5225280	5228220	ago, but I wanted to keep them up.
5228220	5232840	They were an essential part of my history that represented pretty much half of the time
5232840	5236340	that I spent making content on this website.
5236340	5238020	Most of my new viewers, they don't care.
5238020	5240680	They're obviously here to watch the new stuff.
5240680	5246680	But for anyone who did and was curious into how I got to where I got, they were there
5246680	5248100	for them.
5248100	5249100	And I tried.
5249140	5252580	I tried to keep them up for as long as I could.
5252580	5257900	But eventually they put me into a position where their existence on my channel became
5257900	5260280	untenable.
5260280	5265740	I always got the suspicion that YouTube and their internal systems didn't like that I
5265740	5269660	had all these radically different videos on my channel.
5269660	5274520	For my entire career, I had seen my catalog of YouTube poops slowly but surely decay away
5274520	5279000	and become no longer viewable to the public.
5279000	5284600	I really tried to keep them up for as long as I could to preserve the memory.
5284600	5290020	But in June of last year, one of those videos put me in just such a bad situation that I
5290020	5293800	couldn't justify keeping them up on the channel anymore.
5293800	5301020	It was somewhat fitting that the big problem came from the original Green Simpsons video.
5301020	5305200	The video that arguably started the downward spiral to begin with.
5305220	5309580	Basically, YouTube flagged that video for terrorist activity.
5309580	5315300	And I didn't know it at the time, but when you get a strike of that nature, YouTube strips
5315300	5318940	your entire channel of monetization.
5318940	5326700	So within one instant, after getting one strike, I was making $0 off of any of my videos.
5326700	5332060	Had it happened earlier in my career, I just would have had no way out and I would have
5332060	5334800	been forced to quit right there.
5334800	5340300	Thankfully, I've reached a position in the YouTube community where I know enough people
5340300	5346480	who know people at YouTube and they can actually go in and manually get it resolved.
5346480	5352800	After 48 hours, I had my monetization restored and the biggest scare I had ever had on this
5352800	5355600	channel was averted.
5355620	5362860	But in those two days where I had my primary source of revenue stripped, I felt horrible.
5362860	5365260	I felt downright depressed.
5365260	5369860	I was at a point where I couldn't imagine myself doing anything else than making YouTube
5369860	5371700	videos.
5371700	5377640	If that would have been the end of my career, I don't know what I would have done.
5377640	5383260	Anything else I would have done with my life, I would have just been a ghost.
5383260	5386240	My heart wouldn't be in it.
5386240	5387240	It's excruciating.
5387240	5394400	It was an excruciating position to be in and it was only possible because of these YouTube
5394400	5400380	poop videos that were continuing to just cause me problems.
5400380	5407120	And so I sat on the idea for about a month and eventually I went through with it, where
5407120	5412360	I went through and privated every single YouTube poop on my channel.
5412360	5413940	Well not every single one.
5413940	5420180	I left my very first YouTube poop up just as sort of a totem to show people that this
5420180	5422220	is where it all began.
5422220	5425780	But everything else was pretty much gone.
5425780	5430520	That whole part of my history erased.
5430520	5431520	It was tough.
5431520	5433400	I felt real bad about it.
5433400	5437280	But you know, when I made the announcement that I was getting rid of them, something
5437280	5444420	very funny happened, where all the old Emperor Lemon fans started to come out of the woodwork,
5444420	5449620	telling me how much they loved the videos, how they were so sad to see them go.
5449620	5455060	I really wish they could have been around when I actually needed to hear that.
5455060	5460100	You know, back then, choosing to leave YouTube poop in the first place, I certainly didn't
5460100	5463080	feel appreciated.
5463080	5469420	Part of me wishes I had known then that these stupid videos actually did matter to a lot
5469420	5471080	of people.
5471080	5474000	But you know, it had to be done.
5474000	5479840	There was really no other way for me to constantly continue with this channel that I financially
5479840	5484960	depend on and jeopardize it in the way that these videos were.
5484960	5489680	I came to view it as basically 50 ticking time bombs, where it's only a matter of time
5489680	5494780	before any one of them could cause catastrophic issues in the future.
5494780	5496420	I had to do it.
5496420	5500980	I had to close that chapter of my career forever.
5500980	5505380	And then, once the deed was done, the funniest thing happened.
5505380	5509320	The next video I uploaded got on the Trending tab.
5509320	5513640	I always considered myself on the side of the platform that YouTube never wanted to
5513640	5514900	acknowledge.
5514900	5522100	And yet here it was, my video on Trending, the ultimate trophy case of YouTube favoritism.
5522100	5526900	To me, it was almost like a sign that after I'd sacrificed something so near and dear
5526900	5532840	to me, YouTube had finally relented and gave me the green light.
5532840	5537760	And ever since then, my videos have been performing better than at any point in the history of
5537760	5539560	my career.
5539560	5545680	I don't know if I believe in destiny, but with how this YouTube thing worked out, it's
5545680	5549400	really made me considerate.
5549400	5557040	So what does it mean that EmPlemon reached a million subscribers?
5557040	5564000	Something that realistically, in all likelihood, should have never happened in a million years.
5564000	5566760	But here we are.
5566760	5572200	I reached the proverbial YouTube mountaintop, the lifetime achievement award for a career
5572200	5574200	well spent.
5574200	5579520	Twelve years of trying, twelve years of frustration, but I made it.
5579520	5584080	I made it to the point that every YouTuber wants to reach when they first open up their
5584080	5585720	account.
5585720	5588240	It shouldn't have been possible.
5588240	5594180	Based on the types of videos I made and how I presented myself and all the times I wanted
5594180	5597460	to give up, it shouldn't have happened.
5597460	5603760	I'm not usually one to look at my subscriber numbers, but when the day came, I tuned in.
5603760	5608960	Seeing that number cross over to a million, it's something you only get to experience
5608960	5610940	once in a lifetime.
5610940	5616860	And so when the moment finally came, I just sort of sat there in front of my computer
5616860	5619940	monitor in stunned silence.
5619940	5625660	I felt like I just crossed over into a new reality that I didn't imagine was possible.
5625660	5631140	I mean, I thought I was capable of getting pretty far in YouTube, but not this far.
5631140	5636060	I always imagined that something would have come up and stopped me before I got the chance
5636060	5638360	to experience that moment.
5638360	5639660	But there it was.
5639660	5642300	I reached the million.
5642300	5646540	People can say what they want about me, but that's something that they can never take
5646540	5648140	away.
5648140	5654180	It's a big milestone, possibly the biggest that any YouTuber can experience.
5654180	5661540	I don't anticipate any other subscriber number being as impactful as seeing those digits
5661540	5665120	cross over into seven figures for the first time.
5665120	5669380	It was like when I reached a million, the credits of YouTube start rolling.
5669380	5671640	You've pretty much beaten the game.
5671640	5676720	Once you've reached that level of success, you've made it to the big leagues.
5676720	5683600	And I wasn't really sure at the time if I was ready to take that step.
5683600	5687280	Yeah, at the end of the day, it's just a number.
5687280	5692220	Nothing in reality tangibly changed from either side of that moment.
5692220	5696920	But I'll tell you what, I certainly felt different.
5696920	5702700	I felt like suddenly a huge weight and a huge pressure had been lifted, almost like
5702700	5709400	that chip on my shoulder I had for so many years had finally run out of steam.
5709400	5713440	You know, I've always been someone who's been motivated by the chase and not so much the
5713440	5714520	trophy.
5714520	5719260	It was hard work getting to a million, 12 years of my life.
5719260	5724520	As of that moment, I think I actually spent a majority of my life making YouTube videos.
5725320	5730400	But you know, throughout the whole story, I kind of felt this force pulling me along
5730400	5736140	because it was difficult, because a guy like me wasn't supposed to make it.
5736140	5741000	And throughout my whole career, I've always kind of made it my mission to prove people
5741000	5742000	wrong.
5742000	5746600	You know, finally reaching a million after all this time, it was really validating for
5746600	5747840	sure.
5747840	5752880	But I feel like I also lost a bit of the mojo that carried me to this point in the first
5752880	5754040	place.
5754040	5759320	I think thus far I've definitely been in a different mindset coming out of it.
5759320	5764360	And I'm just going to have to wait and see how that turns out.
5764360	5768240	And that pretty much brings us to today.
5768240	5773740	So I guess that's the story of my YouTube channel.
5773740	5780360	You know, there may be many others like it, but this one is mine.
5780360	5785640	Did he seriously just fall asleep?
5785640	5788200	Who am I kidding?
5788200	5793360	It's the best he's been at therapy in years.
5793360	5794880	Sorry for dozing off there.
5794880	5798160	The story was just kind of dragging on a bit.
5798160	5799620	Oh, come on, Rusty.
5799620	5802520	This is supposed to be a special moment.
5802520	5803520	Don't you feel special?
5803520	5809940	I mean, after all, I don't exactly do this kind of stuff every day.
5809940	5810940	So is that it?
5810940	5814480	Is the downward spiral finally over?
5814480	5818860	You know what?
5818860	5821220	I don't know about that.
5821220	5826260	You know, for the past six years, ever since I stopped making YouTube poops, I've been
5826260	5829780	telling myself that I've been on a downward spiral.
5829780	5835380	But now that I've passed a million, can I even still say that anymore?
5835380	5840620	Now that my career has finally reached the point where I passed that magic number, has
5840620	5844020	the downward spiral ceased to exist?
5844020	5850860	You know, have I finally come out of it, where I no longer have the grounds to complain about
5850860	5853760	how I've been treated on YouTube?
5853760	5859280	Because for the last couple of years, I'd say I've been treated pretty well.
5859280	5863460	And for part of me, it's hard to admit that.
5863460	5868700	You know, based on my experiences on YouTube and just how close I was at so many points
5868700	5876300	to the edge of control, I'm of the philosophy that it can all just go away in an instant.
5876300	5881900	And what's strange to think about is that how I feel now is oddly similar to how I felt
5881900	5887340	back in 2014, when everything seemed like it was going so well.
5887340	5892980	You know, going through the downward spiral back at 100K, I ended up surviving, yeah,
5893500	5896660	but it wasn't without its consequences.
5896660	5899460	It took a toll on me, for sure.
5899460	5904380	And I look at my channel now versus then, and it's 10 times bigger.
5904380	5908700	If you ask me, that's 10 times farther to fall.
5908700	5916360	It's a fall that's daunting enough where I'm not quite sure if I could survive this time around.
5916360	5921620	And so I think I'll always have that fear in the back of my head that the downward spiral
5921660	5926460	is not yet finished, and that I haven't seen the worst of it.
5926460	5931140	But hey, at the end of the day, that's the burden I carry.
5931140	5932580	It ain't easy being green.
5951620	5953620	It ain't easy being green.
