0	15200	In 1943, the deadliest conflict in human history was taking place on the European continent.
15200	23200	Millions of poor souls from all walks of life were subjected to unspeakable horrors and rallied against unimaginable evil.
23200	28300	Many of these unfortunate people tried to forge what little goodwill they could through memes.
28300	33200	When humanity sunk to its lowest point, memes were there to pick us back up.
33200	41700	75 years later, the very descendants of those heroic forefathers who liberated the continent they inhabit are trying to ban memes entirely.
41700	46300	They will tell you the same lie that they have always told you when they take away your freedom.
46300	48800	They'll say that they're protecting people.
48800	54600	They won't tell you that those people are limited to themselves, the very powerful few.
54600	56900	Those who would have never had to go to war.
56900	62700	Those who instigated and orchestrated the conflict that killed 60 million innocent people.
62700	70800	They want to take away your memes not only because they don't understand memes, but also because they fear memes.
70800	75400	Memes are the most fundamental property of the common man.
75400	77100	They are unalienable.
77100	80800	They transcend language, culture, and religion.
80800	84800	They allow us to communicate without saying a single word.
84800	89400	But most importantly, they are the fastest way to put an idea in someone's head.
89400	93700	This includes ideas of unrest, dissidents, and rebellion.
93700	97900	Memes are the fastest way to undermine authority.
97900	107000	And if any corrupt dictatorship wishes to maintain its influence, the first thing it will do is stop the spread of information among the masses.
107000	111200	Because we can't start a revolution if we can't talk to each other.
111200	113600	Banning memes is always the first step.
