1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,200
In 1943, the deadliest conflict in human history was taking place on the European continent.

2
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:23,200
Millions of poor souls from all walks of life were subjected to unspeakable horrors and rallied against unimaginable evil.

3
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:28,300
Many of these unfortunate people tried to forge what little goodwill they could through memes.

4
00:00:28,300 --> 00:00:33,200
When humanity sunk to its lowest point, memes were there to pick us back up.

5
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:41,700
75 years later, the very descendants of those heroic forefathers who liberated the continent they inhabit are trying to ban memes entirely.

6
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:46,300
They will tell you the same lie that they have always told you when they take away your freedom.

7
00:00:46,300 --> 00:00:48,800
They'll say that they're protecting people.

8
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:54,600
They won't tell you that those people are limited to themselves, the very powerful few.

9
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:56,900
Those who would have never had to go to war.

10
00:00:56,900 --> 00:01:02,700
Those who instigated and orchestrated the conflict that killed 60 million innocent people.

11
00:01:02,700 --> 00:01:10,800
They want to take away your memes not only because they don't understand memes, but also because they fear memes.

12
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:15,400
Memes are the most fundamental property of the common man.

13
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:17,100
They are unalienable.

14
00:01:17,100 --> 00:01:20,800
They transcend language, culture, and religion.

15
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:24,800
They allow us to communicate without saying a single word.

16
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:29,400
But most importantly, they are the fastest way to put an idea in someone's head.

17
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:33,700
This includes ideas of unrest, dissidents, and rebellion.

18
00:01:33,700 --> 00:01:37,900
Memes are the fastest way to undermine authority.

19
00:01:37,900 --> 00:01:47,000
And if any corrupt dictatorship wishes to maintain its influence, the first thing it will do is stop the spread of information among the masses.

20
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:51,200
Because we can't start a revolution if we can't talk to each other.

21
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:53,600
Banning memes is always the first step.
