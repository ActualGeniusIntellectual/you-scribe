0	5360	Today, we're gonna take a break from YouTube and set our sights on twitter.com the website
5360	9720	Everyone seems to know about but no one really uses and who can really blame them
9720	11720	It's not a place for normal people
12040	18820	You see normal people are content with broadcasting their opinions to their local community of friends and family on Twitter
18820	22560	You believe your opinions are important enough to share with the whole world
22560	27380	Of course, it's no surprise that this premise attracts a special kind of person
27380	31360	You almost have to have some sort of mental disorder to even tolerate this place
32320	35480	narcissism sociopathy downward spiral paranoia
35760	41260	Twitter is basically just a giant mental institution preventing these people from infesting the rest of the web
41640	46620	Twitter's user base is that dude you knew in high school who would smugly correct you about everything
47120	53660	Smug is actually one of the only three emotions. You're allowed to feel on Twitter the others being passive-aggressive and
53660	60580	It's an environment where you can slip up just once even in an honest mistake from years ago
60580	68500	And you'll get tarred and feathered by a mob of anime profile pics then beheaded by kpop stans and taxidermized by militant political
68940	76140	Activists if Instagram is the blissful blue pill of ignorance Twitter is like sticking a razor blade up your sinuses
76380	81220	Twitter is what would happen if you took YouTube's comment section and made that the entire website
81220	84060	I apologize for the long-winded diatribe
84060	89860	But I really have to hammer in the point of how little value Twitter has to its users on Twitter
89860	92260	You have nothing no game, but everything to lose
92980	98860	Youtubers get ad revenue Instagram models can work their way up to make sponsored posts even on reddit
98860	102260	You can at least get gold by being the biggest suck-up imaginable
102460	108660	There is no monetary incentive to use Twitter by the time you get big enough to make sponsored tweets
108700	112380	You're almost certainly at a status where you can make money in spite of yourself
112380	117980	If you're beneath this level then good luck getting anything out of Twitter. Well, that's not exactly true
117980	125100	There are at least a few things you can get from Twitter. You can get canceled. You can get suspended for no reason
125820	129740	Realistically, the only redeeming quality of Twitter is networking as a content creator
129980	134140	But if you're just a regular user, I have no idea how you tolerate this place
134860	138340	Except there is one other incentive to use Twitter
138780	143620	With no money to be made the theoretical endgame of Twitter is to get one of these
144420	149980	Twitter's verification badge the lone token of achievement in a cesspool of sin and misery
150540	152060	So, how do you get it?
152060	159160	Well step one be a reporter corporation or elite public figure if you're not any of these things then just give up
159620	162620	One day I got this joking reply to one of my tweets
162660	164660	But it raises a very valid question
165180	168760	Why is it so much harder to get verified on Twitter than anywhere else?
169500	173180	Grande 1.2 million Twitter followers not verified
173740	179820	Critical 5 million YouTube subscribers nearly a million twitch followers not verified
180060	185020	Call me Carson over a million Twitter followers all of his posts get over
185540	190060	50,000 likes he trended on Twitter from people wishing him. Happy birthday
190860	197980	Not verified you go to the official verification page on Twitter and it's been radio silent for the past two and a half years
198520	206260	They keep saying to check back later for the new and improved verification system, but later never comes what's going on here?
206460	209460	Pretty much every website has a verification system
209860	215020	YouTube Instagram Pornhub Edmodo once you accumulate a high enough status
215620	217620	Something has to prevent people from just
218020	220020	Impersonating you and damaging your reputation
220420	227820	This is the theoretical purpose of a verification system on any website and almost all websites have no issues whatsoever
228340	230340	implementing the system in practice
230340	233820	Last year my friend rusty cage got verified on Instagram while
234220	238560	Simultaneously being suspended multiple times without any chance for appeal on Twitter
238780	243500	It really just goes to show how differently Twitter treats its users than any other site
243900	250340	For some reason Twitter has taken this simple concept and corrupted it into a confusing and unrecognizable mess
250820	255540	How did this happen? And what steps can you take to actually get verified on this website?
256100	261620	Well using some of the Twitter connections I've made over the years. I'm gonna try my best to answer this question
262300	267300	First how did we get here and how has Twitter's verification system changed over time?
267300	269300	Back
270660	276380	In 2009 Twitter was becoming a big player in the world of social media on the world wide web
276920	282980	With celebrities from across the world flocking to the site to share their lives in 140 characters
282980	290000	The problem was some of these accounts claiming to be people of note to weren't who they said they were rather just imposters
290340	296580	When st. Louis Cardinals manager Tony La Russa found out someone was impersonating him on the site
296820	304200	He went on to sue Twitter for damages not wanting this to happen again the fine people at the internet startup devised a verification
304540	311960	System that would allow famous users to protect their identity from being stolen by those with nefarious motives in the early days
311960	314420	This was made specifically for celebrities
314980	318920	Musicians athletes and other public figures and a year or so later
319340	325160	Brands and companies would be added to that list the process to get a blue checkmark seemed to be on a need to know
325200	329360	Basis if you were popular enough to need one you'd know how to get it
329360	336640	The ad verified account is the public's best glimpse into the system at play as it follows every single person
336640	338640	That has been given verified status
339240	343040	between 2009 and 2016 the site verified on average
343680	348520	25,000 accounts per year totaling a hundred and eighty six thousand out of 300 million
348860	353800	Some of these seem more justifiable than others in the summer of 2016
354120	362040	Twitter released a public application for verification this event coincided with the last generation of youtubers to get verified a
362560	366840	Generation considered by some Twitter users to have set our culture back by a decade
367300	372520	Sometimes I wish I could go back a decade to a time when Twitter would actually verify youtubers
372720	377360	But I guess the next best thing is just asking these guys what the process was like now
377360	381520	I don't have contact with Joji or I dubs and Chad isn't verified
381600	384520	So that just leaves max mofo as my only option
384680	389800	Let's see what he had to say max told me that he didn't quite remember the specific process
389800	393680	But he thinks it probably happened as soon as the public application became available
394000	400760	The web archive shows that max was verified as of September 2016. So this timing appears to check out
400980	407900	What matters here is that the verification process back then was free and easy and the bar for entry was relatively low
408400	414480	Twitter's verification system was more equitable than ever before but it would not last long the time
417260	419820	Execute order 66
424140	431440	On November 9th 2017 Twitter announced that they were indefinitely suspending the verification process across the entire site
431760	435740	They would go on to strip verification from numerous controversial accounts
435900	442940	Most notably de-verifying prominent white nationalist Richard Spencer while many celebrated the announcement as a justified punishment
443500	446020	It didn't really make any sense administratively
446460	453500	Twitter's reasoning for de-verifying accounts was that an unnamed minority of users began to view the blue checkmark as an endorsement
454060	461660	Prior to the change. I found very little evidence of anyone publicly complaining about this as the nature of verification should be obvious
461820	468140	It's a simple demarcation of a public figure if Kim Jong-un were on Twitter should he be verified
468380	471820	What about Pablo Escobar or Ted Bundy surely?
471820	474580	No one at Twitter would endorse any of their actions
474620	482360	But as such highly publicized individuals it would be bizarre to imagine that these people wouldn't be verified on any public forum
482540	486700	The idea that verifications equal endorsements is incredibly flimsy
486940	492900	These two concepts are completely unrelated yet Twitter chose to conflate them based on an unknown number of
493340	495340	unspecified users getting confused
495540	499500	But let's get more confusing just one year earlier in 2016
500060	503900	Twitter suspended Richard Spencer and then reinstated him with his verification
504860	511300	Upholding that verification does not equal endorsement today when you look at Twitter's official verification page
511340	517940	It specifically states that verification does not equal endorsement and there's an important reason behind this
518500	524060	Recently President Trump threatened executive action against Twitter that would remove one of its safe harbor provisions
524060	531580	I've talked about a type of safe harbor before as it pertains to copyright law and a similar provision exists in section 230 of the
531820	537560	Communications Decency Act which protects sites like Twitter from being held liable for the conduct of their users
537800	545140	What's important here is that the exemption only exists if Twitter does not act as a publisher by treating verification as an endorsement
545600	553440	Twitter could potentially jeopardize their safe harbor protection by assuming responsibility over user conduct by choosing to curate
553840	561200	Verification along their own subjective standards Twitter could have been classified as a publisher of any content posted by verified accounts
561640	565560	Opening themselves up to potentially devastating liabilities now
565560	569160	I'm in no way a legal expert so I could be completely wrong here
569160	573980	But this is just my best explanation for why Twitter has been so inconsistent with this issue
574400	579880	So far seems that this whole campaign was just a bunch of lip service after 2017
579880	583560	They have made no major effort to de-verify controversial accounts
583840	588000	So was this whole exercise just completely pointless for users?
588000	593900	Yes, but for Twitter possibly not while Richard Spencer drew in all the attention from the incident
594140	598900	Nobody realized that this event would mark the end of equitable verification on Twitter entirely
599300	604880	Not only that but every existing support article about verification was subsequently removed
605520	610380	Links to these old articles now all redirect to a generic page with barely any information
610900	615220	To this day public verification on Twitter remains indefinitely suspended
615400	622000	So what led Twitter to quietly make such a drastic change to find out why we have to follow the money
624900	626900	In
627260	631960	2015 Twitter's active user base plateaued the site was no longer growing
632380	636060	Just one year afterwards Twitter stock price had fallen by 70%
636500	643900	The company's then CEO Dick Costello was pressured to step down and was replaced by current Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey
644240	649300	For most of 2017 the stock price remained stagnant while the rest of the market surged
649740	653500	Twitter was in bad shape and investors were rapidly losing confidence
654180	659300	Numerous financial publications listed Jack Dorsey among the worst CEOs in America
659780	666660	Starting November 9th Twitter suspended verification and then went on to post its first profitable quarter in company history
667580	670660	2018 saw Twitter's revenue increase by nearly 25%
671380	678100	Causing the stock price to effectively double it was at this point that the worthless blue checkmark became a commodity
678180	685040	But how do you convert a blue badge into green paper to find out we have to cross over to the corporate side of Twitter
690740	694940	Brand Twitter, there's nothing else really like it long ago
694940	701860	Pretty much every brand account on Twitter only existed to spam hashtags and submissively apologize to disgruntled customers
702020	709460	Then everything changed when Wendy's attacked all of a sudden every brand you can imagine was jockeying to see who can make the most
709460	715680	viral tweet this quickly escalated to empathetic moon pie consoling depressed Sunny D
715940	718640	You're looking at the future of marketing here people
719260	726060	Basically every brand who was any brand had to develop a sassy or relatable persona and playfully banter with each other on Twitter
726340	732860	It's so convincing they act just like people they show emotions just like people
732980	735840	But don't be fooled much like in general society
736300	741420	these brands are among the most powerful members of Twitter and there's a good reason for that as
741700	748580	Much as Twitter's leadership would like you to forget Twitter is a for-profit business first and a public forum second
748700	752140	Like many sites Twitter earns its revenue from advertising
752700	756460	Brands provide the funding that Twitter needs to survive as a business
756540	763900	So it should be no surprise why brands tend to receive the most preferential treatment brand accounts have the easiest path to verification
764300	766980	It's surprising to find one without a checkmark
767380	772860	You'd think they get it automatically, but it's actually not that simple while researching this video
772860	777980	I actually had to enter forbidden territory by consulting the wisdom of a real-life brand
778700	781340	Thankfully stake um had followed me some time ago
781380	788360	So I reached out to them for comment what they told me may shock you it turns out that after Twitter suspended
788680	791980	Verification the change was severe enough to affect some brands
792500	797620	Steak-um actually had to create their own guerrilla campaign in order to draw the attention of the right people
798200	803700	According to them Twitter prioritizes verifying companies that spend the most advertising money on the site
803860	809900	This key piece of information may explain why Twitter verification has seemed so inaccessible over the past few years
810380	815000	The checkmark itself doesn't generate revenue, but it rewards companies who do
815500	820340	Keeping the checkmark accessible would devalue its purpose as an incentive for ad spending
820340	824380	This could also explain why so many accounts in the news industry are verified
824740	830300	News media is one of the only industries to heavily rely on Twitter as part of the rat race to get clicks
830620	835500	There's no doubt that news articles play a heavy role in Twitter's information economy
835860	842780	Featured articles will drive the most traffic to their native sites and one has to wonder how much some of these media outlets spend to
842780	844800	Put themselves in that position now
844800	848900	I'm not saying that the checkmark is the sole reason for Twitter's boom in revenue
849020	856060	But it's almost certainly symptomatic of the site's more brand-happy business model as of late and based on its success so far
856900	859300	Verification may never return to how it once was
859900	867020	Welcome to the age of the blue filter where independent creators without industry backing may be stuck without a checkmark forever
867220	871880	In this age only a few creators have managed to buck the trend to get verified
871960	875380	So I reached out to as many as I could and asked them how they did it
880100	886980	Cavos is a youtuber you wouldn't expect to be verified on Twitter given the far more massive channels who still remain unverified
887180	889980	So I asked him how he did it and this is what he had to say
890580	893420	Cavos is part of the YouTube network BBTV
893980	899700	Sometime in 2019. He put in a request to the network to get him verified on Twitter three months later
899700	904940	The network succeeded so it appears that joining a YouTube network could help you get verified
905300	909300	However, most youtubers would generally not recommend joining a YouTube network
909900	914060	Given how many of them take a decent cut of your pay to do basically nothing
914900	918400	Occasionally, you'll get the rare goody like the coveted blue checkmark
918500	923380	but other than that networks tend to carry a great risk for creators with little benefit if
923600	929980	You have to resort to a management company. You may just want to pump and dump them like too mad, you know the vibes
931540	934160	Well, literally I signed with some management company and
935340	938340	They submitted me to some guy this guy named Zach Mazota
938700	942040	This guy's like I was gonna verify his people a lot of gaming guys
942360	946720	And I mean I had no idea was coming he just let me know like at one point like yo
946720	951100	I also submit you for verification. I was like, oh wait, really? Yeah, they replied. They said yeah, it should be done
951100	953240	Oh the way what really? Okay
953800	957020	So then after a little while it happened. I just got verified
963400	970200	Earlier this year alpha rats successfully became one of the only accounts in history to get verified with an anime profile picture
970240	976880	I saw some rumors that he may have encouraged his fans to impersonate him so he could force Twitter to verify him this same
977200	982960	Impersonation exploit is suggested in a video by tech boomers, but doesn't appear to have worked on their own account
983480	987840	Starting a mass impersonation campaign seems like a one-way ticket to getting banned
988080	990840	So I asked alpha rat if these rumors were true
991080	996260	It turns out he actually got verified with help from eSports organization Panda global
996420	1000820	This explains how so many eSports competitors seem to get verified so easily
1001340	1008220	Unlike a YouTube network eSports organizations pay you to help manage your profile, but also unlike a YouTube network
1008220	1011300	You can't just sign up for FaZe Clan or Team Liquid
1011540	1019180	These organizations only tend to sponsor the most elite eSports players not exactly a practical option for content creators
1019180	1023860	Just looking to get verified on Twitter if you're looking for the most direct path to verification
1024220	1027380	You may have to follow in the footsteps of Cowbelly Studios
1028100	1035220	Recently, he shared this post detailing the process of how he got verified. So I asked him to elaborate on how the system works
1035860	1040820	Basically, he hired a specialized service to have Twitter review his account for verification
1040820	1047900	The service ran through a site called famous influencer.com and as part of the process they groomed his profile for success
1048260	1051720	Giving him the criteria that Twitter currently requires for verification
1052400	1057800	Some of the requirements are just cosmetic such as displaying your real name and face on your profile
1058440	1064760	personally, I found this somewhat counterintuitive as your followers should be used to your specific branding and persona and
1065160	1067840	Disrupting that is definitely gonna hurt your engagement
1067840	1073160	I mean should we expect rappers to display their real names before verifying their profiles?
1073240	1077020	It seems kind of dumb to me. This place isn't exactly LinkedIn
1077420	1078980	Here's the real kicker though
1078980	1086200	The most important factor in Twitter's new standards for verification is whether or not you've been featured in mainstream news articles
1086500	1092500	Now personally, I've actually been cited and interviewed for quite a few online articles one time
1092500	1095860	I even made the cover of meme insider. So where's my badge?
1096200	1101060	Well showing up in articles only takes you so far to actually get verified
1101060	1104780	You need to initiate a manual review by a contact at Twitter
1105380	1111660	Contact what are you talking about? The enigmatic Twitter contact is the final boss of verification
1112300	1119480	They are people speculated to work within Twitter's communications department who serve as the ultimate gatekeepers of the blue checkmark
1119840	1122260	You could meet all the criteria for verification
1122660	1127580	But without access to a contact the blue checkmark will forever remain out of reach
1127820	1132900	This is why someone like nerd city who has been featured in dozens of articles still remains
1133220	1140820	Unverified and as it turns out the lion's share of Twitter contacts are held by big companies political institutions and news publications
1141660	1148880	If multi-million dollar brands like stacum have trouble getting in touch with one then what chance do independent creators have?
1149560	1156000	PR agencies like famous influencer will sell you the opportunity to reach a contact for the low low price of
1156260	1160580	5,000 pounds and that's if you already have the mainstream news coverage
1160920	1168460	Famous influencer also has a network of mainstream press writers at their disposal to totally manufacture you into a media darling
1168460	1171540	Of course at the additional cost of thousands more
1171940	1178940	Over just a few years Twitter has managed to take a free feature and stick it behind what is essentially a paywall of thousands of
1178940	1185880	Dollars and they have deliberately tried to restrict access to any information about how the verification process even works
1186400	1190980	Twitter now resembles a pay-to-win game and I'm not really sure I want to play anymore
1198440	1204840	This site has become a permanent reminder to me that as bad as YouTube's leadership is it can still get worse
1205400	1210480	Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey always boasts about wanting to promote healthy conversation
1210960	1214040	Usually while introducing features that literally restrict
1214320	1221560	Conversation our platform promotes speech unless people violate our rules you listen to Twitter's officials talk about this site
1221560	1227760	Like they're building some sort of utopia of erudite public discourse. Have you seen the people on this site?
1228000	1233500	It's not a vocal minority go click on any trend on the discover page and you'll see enraged
1233800	1237520	Psychopaths viciously attacking each other like someone kicked over a hornet's nest
1237960	1241960	It's a site where otherwise calm people go to have an emotional meltdown
1242680	1246120	Basically, if you're looking for healthy discussion, you've come to the wrong place
1246840	1250700	Well, you think this is going to cause a little more anger the world is an angry place
1251120	1255040	But you know what certainly doesn't help the harmonious temperament of the site
1255640	1260520	Creating an arbitrary system to segregate the protected elites from the worthless plebs
1261160	1262800	Twitter has corrupted the
1262800	1269840	Verification system to such an extent where lots of people seem to have more respect for non verified people than verified people
1270120	1276540	The phrase blue checkmark has quite literally become a pejorative term against obnoxious verified accounts
1276680	1283780	But it's hard to blame the blue checkmarks for acting like any other user a few months ago critical made a point about twitches
1284120	1286520	inconsistent enforcement of their community guidelines
1287160	1293040	Specifically how certain female streamers seem immune from punishment. That's pretty much like the twitch mod team here
1293040	1297160	Just operating in secrecy, which is the worst way of doing things with no transparency
1297160	1302800	It just leads to a lot of confusion and a lot of bad things even for the streamers that they seem to want to protect
1302800	1304720	And I don't even know if that's the right word for it
1304720	1308920	I don't even know if they're making a conscious decision to protect streamers, but just this weird favoritism
1308920	1312920	They seem to play in this bias leads to these conspiracy theories where you know
1312920	1318960	All women are invincible on twitch because they're giving nude photos to the mod team for special treatment
1318960	1326520	He said that by arbitrarily protecting female streamers twitch encourages its community to unfairly target and resent them
1326960	1333040	Similarly, I feel that Twitter's inconsistent verification system has caused people to distrust verified accounts
1333040	1340480	I have no doubt in my mind that the commodification of the blue checkmark has contributed to the public's growing resentment of journalists
1340840	1346080	People new to the site have to wonder why a random reporter with five thousand followers is verified
1346080	1348080	but their favorite youtuber with
1348560	1356680	500,000 followers isn't this distinction can only create suspicion and discontent and it makes the site look incredibly out of touch with its users
1356960	1363240	Perhaps the gatekeeping wouldn't be as much of an issue if Twitter actually applied consistently strict standards to everyone
1363360	1368680	But when journalists get to act as unprofessionally as anyone else while flexing their I'm better than you badge
1368880	1373680	The whole thing reeks of systematic favoritism. Oh my gosh, is that an article?
1374800	1379200	You're a journalist. That's so great here. Why don't you take about ten of these give them to all your friends?
1379720	1381800	People may bash the blue checkmarks
1381800	1386940	But Twitter itself is to blame for administering such a skewed system at least YouTube
1387160	1392520	Despite all of its problems has managed to create and maintain an equitable verification system
1392640	1396680	There is no such stigma around gray checkmarks on YouTube
1396880	1401720	But still in classic YouTube fashion they had to at least try and ruin it
1402040	1407200	Remember last year when for absolutely no reason YouTube tried to overhaul the verification
1407480	1410920	System in a thinly veiled attempt to elevate corporate accounts
1411320	1418480	Remember how universally unpopular it was and how everyone flipped out to such an extent that YouTube backed out after
1418600	1420640	24 hours and never brought it up again
1421080	1428160	Well, guess what fellas that garbage system proposed by YouTube is how Twitter's verification system works right now and
1428460	1435400	Unlike YouTube Twitter shows no signs of remorse about it. They openly mock how they deliberately neglect their users
1435400	1437400	It's all just a big joke to them
1437440	1438080	You know
1438080	1445680	Maybe more people would actually use this site if the management didn't treat the average user with utter contempt and it's not just the
1445960	1447960	verification system that reflects this
1448240	1453200	Recently Twitter user lamest chris documented compelling evidence of a belligerent account
1453280	1458920	Abusing an insider connection at Twitter support to ban innocent users without any recourse for appeal
1459080	1465920	This is in addition to a never-ending string of DMCA takedowns in which Twitter allows trolls to submit unlimited false
1466000	1468000	Copyright claims with no proof whatsoever
1468360	1472080	This is a site where you can literally post gore and pornography
1472080	1475400	But god forbid you depict cheese at hitting the World Trade Center
1475680	1481880	Our platform promotes speech unless people violate our rules Twitter wants to be seen as a utopia
1481880	1484940	So why does using this site feel like I'm in Soviet Russia?
1485080	1490740	The site is in general disrepair people constantly disappear without warning and the corrupt
1491040	1498240	Delusional leadership would rather focus on a petty pissing contest with America's president than actually responding to the needs of its users
1498240	1502720	I'm sorry, but when state um is a better source of information than your own help page
1502800	1509080	Then maybe your site is a bit of a transparency issue. How does one acquire the illustrious checkmark on?
1509760	1517880	Twitter there's a guy named Kayvon. He's the verification god. So just go to him and he'll get you sorted
1517880	1519880	Oh
1521280	1523960	Brother this guy stinks
1527360	1534400	Actually as I was making this video it's been rumored that Twitter has plans to finally roll out a new public application for verification
1534480	1540000	I guess it took them two and a half years to fix something that wasn't even broken in the first place
1540280	1544480	Who knows maybe we'll be able to trim videos again before the end of the century
1544840	1550760	It just goes to show that the site has so little to offer that they stroke themselves off for adding features that already
1551080	1557240	Existed should have always existed and only don't exist because of their own incompetence. I owe Twitter
1557240	1561600	Can we get that edit button in 2020? The answer is no
1564840	1572960	So in conclusion Twitter is a terrible platform run by terrible people where terrible users have terrible discussions about terrible issues and
1573200	1578920	For some reason this site attracts a bunch of youtubers can't imagine why but at least it's good for networking
1579320	1584680	Because as youtubers, we know that Twitter will hold off on verifying us for as long as they possibly can
1585560	1592760	Almost none of the information I learned in this video came from Twitter itself. It was only made possible through the assortment of connections
1592760	1594120	I've made over the years
1594120	1600600	So despite being a general bane on society Twitter is good for at least one thing as for the blue checkmark
1600600	1602600	I don't even really want it anymore
1602780	1608320	Several thousand dollars is a steep price to pay for something that should be free and the whole machine around it
1608320	1610320	Just leaves a bad taste in my mouth
1610320	1617440	For all intents and purposes having the badge doesn't even do much you get to more easily interact with other verified accounts
1617440	1618600	But that's about it
1618600	1625600	None of the people I interviewed saw a huge improvement in their quality of life after being verified and it didn't seem to contribute to
1625600	1627600	any direct financial benefit
1627920	1633140	Honestly this whole video just made me sad frustrated and was overall just a big waste of time
1633360	1636240	So really no different than my experience browsing Twitter
1636240	1640740	I'm starting to see why PewDiePie left this place at the end of the day
1640740	1645000	I guess the blue checkmark wound up being the most appropriate symbol of Twitter as a whole
1645160	1647820	You have nothing to gain and everything to lose
1657600	1659600	And you'll be watching
