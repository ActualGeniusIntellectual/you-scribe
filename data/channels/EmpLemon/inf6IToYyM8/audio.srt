00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,360
Today, we're gonna take a break from YouTube and set our sights on twitter.com the website

2
00:00:05,360 --> 00:00:09,720
Everyone seems to know about but no one really uses and who can really blame them

3
00:00:09,720 --> 00:00:11,720
It's not a place for normal people

4
00:00:12,040 --> 00:00:18,820
You see normal people are content with broadcasting their opinions to their local community of friends and family on Twitter

5
00:00:18,820 --> 00:00:22,560
You believe your opinions are important enough to share with the whole world

6
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:27,380
Of course, it's no surprise that this premise attracts a special kind of person

7
00:00:27,380 --> 00:00:31,360
You almost have to have some sort of mental disorder to even tolerate this place

8
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:35,480
narcissism sociopathy downward spiral paranoia

9
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:41,260
Twitter is basically just a giant mental institution preventing these people from infesting the rest of the web

10
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:46,620
Twitter's user base is that dude you knew in high school who would smugly correct you about everything

11
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:53,660
Smug is actually one of the only three emotions. You're allowed to feel on Twitter the others being passive-aggressive and

12
00:00:53,660 --> 00:01:00,580
It's an environment where you can slip up just once even in an honest mistake from years ago

13
00:01:00,580 --> 00:01:08,500
And you'll get tarred and feathered by a mob of anime profile pics then beheaded by kpop stans and taxidermized by militant political

14
00:01:08,940 --> 00:01:16,140
Activists if Instagram is the blissful blue pill of ignorance Twitter is like sticking a razor blade up your sinuses

15
00:01:16,380 --> 00:01:21,220
Twitter is what would happen if you took YouTube's comment section and made that the entire website

16
00:01:21,220 --> 00:01:24,060
I apologize for the long-winded diatribe

17
00:01:24,060 --> 00:01:29,860
But I really have to hammer in the point of how little value Twitter has to its users on Twitter

18
00:01:29,860 --> 00:01:32,260
You have nothing no game, but everything to lose

19
00:01:32,980 --> 00:01:38,860
Youtubers get ad revenue Instagram models can work their way up to make sponsored posts even on reddit

20
00:01:38,860 --> 00:01:42,260
You can at least get gold by being the biggest suck-up imaginable

21
00:01:42,460 --> 00:01:48,660
There is no monetary incentive to use Twitter by the time you get big enough to make sponsored tweets

22
00:01:48,700 --> 00:01:52,380
You're almost certainly at a status where you can make money in spite of yourself

23
00:01:52,380 --> 00:01:57,980
If you're beneath this level then good luck getting anything out of Twitter. Well, that's not exactly true

24
00:01:57,980 --> 00:02:05,100
There are at least a few things you can get from Twitter. You can get canceled. You can get suspended for no reason

25
00:02:05,820 --> 00:02:09,740
Realistically, the only redeeming quality of Twitter is networking as a content creator

26
00:02:09,980 --> 00:02:14,140
But if you're just a regular user, I have no idea how you tolerate this place

27
00:02:14,860 --> 00:02:18,340
Except there is one other incentive to use Twitter

28
00:02:18,780 --> 00:02:23,620
With no money to be made the theoretical endgame of Twitter is to get one of these

29
00:02:24,420 --> 00:02:29,980
Twitter's verification badge the lone token of achievement in a cesspool of sin and misery

30
00:02:30,540 --> 00:02:32,060
So, how do you get it?

31
00:02:32,060 --> 00:02:39,160
Well step one be a reporter corporation or elite public figure if you're not any of these things then just give up

32
00:02:39,620 --> 00:02:42,620
One day I got this joking reply to one of my tweets

33
00:02:42,660 --> 00:02:44,660
But it raises a very valid question

34
00:02:45,180 --> 00:02:48,760
Why is it so much harder to get verified on Twitter than anywhere else?

35
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:53,180
Grande 1.2 million Twitter followers not verified

36
00:02:53,740 --> 00:02:59,820
Critical 5 million YouTube subscribers nearly a million twitch followers not verified

37
00:03:00,060 --> 00:03:05,020
Call me Carson over a million Twitter followers all of his posts get over

38
00:03:05,540 --> 00:03:10,060
50,000 likes he trended on Twitter from people wishing him. Happy birthday

39
00:03:10,860 --> 00:03:17,980
Not verified you go to the official verification page on Twitter and it's been radio silent for the past two and a half years

40
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:26,260
They keep saying to check back later for the new and improved verification system, but later never comes what's going on here?

41
00:03:26,460 --> 00:03:29,460
Pretty much every website has a verification system

42
00:03:29,860 --> 00:03:35,020
YouTube Instagram Pornhub Edmodo once you accumulate a high enough status

43
00:03:35,620 --> 00:03:37,620
Something has to prevent people from just

44
00:03:38,020 --> 00:03:40,020
Impersonating you and damaging your reputation

45
00:03:40,420 --> 00:03:47,820
This is the theoretical purpose of a verification system on any website and almost all websites have no issues whatsoever

46
00:03:48,340 --> 00:03:50,340
implementing the system in practice

47
00:03:50,340 --> 00:03:53,820
Last year my friend rusty cage got verified on Instagram while

48
00:03:54,220 --> 00:03:58,560
Simultaneously being suspended multiple times without any chance for appeal on Twitter

49
00:03:58,780 --> 00:04:03,500
It really just goes to show how differently Twitter treats its users than any other site

50
00:04:03,900 --> 00:04:10,340
For some reason Twitter has taken this simple concept and corrupted it into a confusing and unrecognizable mess

51
00:04:10,820 --> 00:04:15,540
How did this happen? And what steps can you take to actually get verified on this website?

52
00:04:16,100 --> 00:04:21,620
Well using some of the Twitter connections I've made over the years. I'm gonna try my best to answer this question

53
00:04:22,300 --> 00:04:27,300
First how did we get here and how has Twitter's verification system changed over time?

54
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:29,300
Back

55
00:04:30,660 --> 00:04:36,380
In 2009 Twitter was becoming a big player in the world of social media on the world wide web

56
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:42,980
With celebrities from across the world flocking to the site to share their lives in 140 characters

57
00:04:42,980 --> 00:04:50,000
The problem was some of these accounts claiming to be people of note to weren't who they said they were rather just imposters

58
00:04:50,340 --> 00:04:56,580
When st. Louis Cardinals manager Tony La Russa found out someone was impersonating him on the site

59
00:04:56,820 --> 00:05:04,200
He went on to sue Twitter for damages not wanting this to happen again the fine people at the internet startup devised a verification

60
00:05:04,540 --> 00:05:11,960
System that would allow famous users to protect their identity from being stolen by those with nefarious motives in the early days

61
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:14,420
This was made specifically for celebrities

62
00:05:14,980 --> 00:05:18,920
Musicians athletes and other public figures and a year or so later

63
00:05:19,340 --> 00:05:25,160
Brands and companies would be added to that list the process to get a blue checkmark seemed to be on a need to know

64
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:29,360
Basis if you were popular enough to need one you'd know how to get it

65
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:36,640
The ad verified account is the public's best glimpse into the system at play as it follows every single person

66
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:38,640
That has been given verified status

67
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:43,040
between 2009 and 2016 the site verified on average

68
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:48,520
25,000 accounts per year totaling a hundred and eighty six thousand out of 300 million

69
00:05:48,860 --> 00:05:53,800
Some of these seem more justifiable than others in the summer of 2016

70
00:05:54,120 --> 00:06:02,040
Twitter released a public application for verification this event coincided with the last generation of youtubers to get verified a

71
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:06,840
Generation considered by some Twitter users to have set our culture back by a decade

72
00:06:07,300 --> 00:06:12,520
Sometimes I wish I could go back a decade to a time when Twitter would actually verify youtubers

73
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:17,360
But I guess the next best thing is just asking these guys what the process was like now

74
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:21,520
I don't have contact with Joji or I dubs and Chad isn't verified

75
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:24,520
So that just leaves max mofo as my only option

76
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:29,800
Let's see what he had to say max told me that he didn't quite remember the specific process

77
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:33,680
But he thinks it probably happened as soon as the public application became available

78
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:40,760
The web archive shows that max was verified as of September 2016. So this timing appears to check out

79
00:06:40,980 --> 00:06:47,900
What matters here is that the verification process back then was free and easy and the bar for entry was relatively low

80
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:54,480
Twitter's verification system was more equitable than ever before but it would not last long the time

81
00:06:57,260 --> 00:06:59,820
Execute order 66

82
00:07:04,140 --> 00:07:11,440
On November 9th 2017 Twitter announced that they were indefinitely suspending the verification process across the entire site

83
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:15,740
They would go on to strip verification from numerous controversial accounts

84
00:07:15,900 --> 00:07:22,940
Most notably de-verifying prominent white nationalist Richard Spencer while many celebrated the announcement as a justified punishment

85
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:26,020
It didn't really make any sense administratively

86
00:07:26,460 --> 00:07:33,500
Twitter's reasoning for de-verifying accounts was that an unnamed minority of users began to view the blue checkmark as an endorsement

87
00:07:34,060 --> 00:07:41,660
Prior to the change. I found very little evidence of anyone publicly complaining about this as the nature of verification should be obvious

88
00:07:41,820 --> 00:07:48,140
It's a simple demarcation of a public figure if Kim Jong-un were on Twitter should he be verified

89
00:07:48,380 --> 00:07:51,820
What about Pablo Escobar or Ted Bundy surely?

90
00:07:51,820 --> 00:07:54,580
No one at Twitter would endorse any of their actions

91
00:07:54,620 --> 00:08:02,360
But as such highly publicized individuals it would be bizarre to imagine that these people wouldn't be verified on any public forum

92
00:08:02,540 --> 00:08:06,700
The idea that verifications equal endorsements is incredibly flimsy

93
00:08:06,940 --> 00:08:12,900
These two concepts are completely unrelated yet Twitter chose to conflate them based on an unknown number of

94
00:08:13,340 --> 00:08:15,340
unspecified users getting confused

95
00:08:15,540 --> 00:08:19,500
But let's get more confusing just one year earlier in 2016

96
00:08:20,060 --> 00:08:23,900
Twitter suspended Richard Spencer and then reinstated him with his verification

97
00:08:24,860 --> 00:08:31,300
Upholding that verification does not equal endorsement today when you look at Twitter's official verification page

98
00:08:31,340 --> 00:08:37,940
It specifically states that verification does not equal endorsement and there's an important reason behind this

99
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:44,060
Recently President Trump threatened executive action against Twitter that would remove one of its safe harbor provisions

100
00:08:44,060 --> 00:08:51,580
I've talked about a type of safe harbor before as it pertains to copyright law and a similar provision exists in section 230 of the

101
00:08:51,820 --> 00:08:57,560
Communications Decency Act which protects sites like Twitter from being held liable for the conduct of their users

102
00:08:57,800 --> 00:09:05,140
What's important here is that the exemption only exists if Twitter does not act as a publisher by treating verification as an endorsement

103
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:13,440
Twitter could potentially jeopardize their safe harbor protection by assuming responsibility over user conduct by choosing to curate

104
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:21,200
Verification along their own subjective standards Twitter could have been classified as a publisher of any content posted by verified accounts

105
00:09:21,640 --> 00:09:25,560
Opening themselves up to potentially devastating liabilities now

106
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:29,160
I'm in no way a legal expert so I could be completely wrong here

107
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:33,980
But this is just my best explanation for why Twitter has been so inconsistent with this issue

108
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:39,880
So far seems that this whole campaign was just a bunch of lip service after 2017

109
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:43,560
They have made no major effort to de-verify controversial accounts

110
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:48,000
So was this whole exercise just completely pointless for users?

111
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:53,900
Yes, but for Twitter possibly not while Richard Spencer drew in all the attention from the incident

112
00:09:54,140 --> 00:09:58,900
Nobody realized that this event would mark the end of equitable verification on Twitter entirely

113
00:09:59,300 --> 00:10:04,880
Not only that but every existing support article about verification was subsequently removed

114
00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:10,380
Links to these old articles now all redirect to a generic page with barely any information

115
00:10:10,900 --> 00:10:15,220
To this day public verification on Twitter remains indefinitely suspended

116
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:22,000
So what led Twitter to quietly make such a drastic change to find out why we have to follow the money

117
00:10:24,900 --> 00:10:26,900
In

118
00:10:27,260 --> 00:10:31,960
2015 Twitter's active user base plateaued the site was no longer growing

119
00:10:32,380 --> 00:10:36,060
Just one year afterwards Twitter stock price had fallen by 70%

120
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:43,900
The company's then CEO Dick Costello was pressured to step down and was replaced by current Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey

121
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:49,300
For most of 2017 the stock price remained stagnant while the rest of the market surged

122
00:10:49,740 --> 00:10:53,500
Twitter was in bad shape and investors were rapidly losing confidence

123
00:10:54,180 --> 00:10:59,300
Numerous financial publications listed Jack Dorsey among the worst CEOs in America

124
00:10:59,780 --> 00:11:06,660
Starting November 9th Twitter suspended verification and then went on to post its first profitable quarter in company history

125
00:11:07,580 --> 00:11:10,660
2018 saw Twitter's revenue increase by nearly 25%

126
00:11:11,380 --> 00:11:18,100
Causing the stock price to effectively double it was at this point that the worthless blue checkmark became a commodity

127
00:11:18,180 --> 00:11:25,040
But how do you convert a blue badge into green paper to find out we have to cross over to the corporate side of Twitter

128
00:11:30,740 --> 00:11:34,940
Brand Twitter, there's nothing else really like it long ago

129
00:11:34,940 --> 00:11:41,860
Pretty much every brand account on Twitter only existed to spam hashtags and submissively apologize to disgruntled customers

130
00:11:42,020 --> 00:11:49,460
Then everything changed when Wendy's attacked all of a sudden every brand you can imagine was jockeying to see who can make the most

131
00:11:49,460 --> 00:11:55,680
viral tweet this quickly escalated to empathetic moon pie consoling depressed Sunny D

132
00:11:55,940 --> 00:11:58,640
You're looking at the future of marketing here people

133
00:11:59,260 --> 00:12:06,060
Basically every brand who was any brand had to develop a sassy or relatable persona and playfully banter with each other on Twitter

134
00:12:06,340 --> 00:12:12,860
It's so convincing they act just like people they show emotions just like people

135
00:12:12,980 --> 00:12:15,840
But don't be fooled much like in general society

136
00:12:16,300 --> 00:12:21,420
these brands are among the most powerful members of Twitter and there's a good reason for that as

137
00:12:21,700 --> 00:12:28,580
Much as Twitter's leadership would like you to forget Twitter is a for-profit business first and a public forum second

138
00:12:28,700 --> 00:12:32,140
Like many sites Twitter earns its revenue from advertising

139
00:12:32,700 --> 00:12:36,460
Brands provide the funding that Twitter needs to survive as a business

140
00:12:36,540 --> 00:12:43,900
So it should be no surprise why brands tend to receive the most preferential treatment brand accounts have the easiest path to verification

141
00:12:44,300 --> 00:12:46,980
It's surprising to find one without a checkmark

142
00:12:47,380 --> 00:12:52,860
You'd think they get it automatically, but it's actually not that simple while researching this video

143
00:12:52,860 --> 00:12:57,980
I actually had to enter forbidden territory by consulting the wisdom of a real-life brand

144
00:12:58,700 --> 00:13:01,340
Thankfully stake um had followed me some time ago

145
00:13:01,380 --> 00:13:08,360
So I reached out to them for comment what they told me may shock you it turns out that after Twitter suspended

146
00:13:08,680 --> 00:13:11,980
Verification the change was severe enough to affect some brands

147
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:17,620
Steak-um actually had to create their own guerrilla campaign in order to draw the attention of the right people

148
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:23,700
According to them Twitter prioritizes verifying companies that spend the most advertising money on the site

149
00:13:23,860 --> 00:13:29,900
This key piece of information may explain why Twitter verification has seemed so inaccessible over the past few years

150
00:13:30,380 --> 00:13:35,000
The checkmark itself doesn't generate revenue, but it rewards companies who do

151
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:40,340
Keeping the checkmark accessible would devalue its purpose as an incentive for ad spending

152
00:13:40,340 --> 00:13:44,380
This could also explain why so many accounts in the news industry are verified

153
00:13:44,740 --> 00:13:50,300
News media is one of the only industries to heavily rely on Twitter as part of the rat race to get clicks

154
00:13:50,620 --> 00:13:55,500
There's no doubt that news articles play a heavy role in Twitter's information economy

155
00:13:55,860 --> 00:14:02,780
Featured articles will drive the most traffic to their native sites and one has to wonder how much some of these media outlets spend to

156
00:14:02,780 --> 00:14:04,800
Put themselves in that position now

157
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:08,900
I'm not saying that the checkmark is the sole reason for Twitter's boom in revenue

158
00:14:09,020 --> 00:14:16,060
But it's almost certainly symptomatic of the site's more brand-happy business model as of late and based on its success so far

159
00:14:16,900 --> 00:14:19,300
Verification may never return to how it once was

160
00:14:19,900 --> 00:14:27,020
Welcome to the age of the blue filter where independent creators without industry backing may be stuck without a checkmark forever

161
00:14:27,220 --> 00:14:31,880
In this age only a few creators have managed to buck the trend to get verified

162
00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:35,380
So I reached out to as many as I could and asked them how they did it

163
00:14:40,100 --> 00:14:46,980
Cavos is a youtuber you wouldn't expect to be verified on Twitter given the far more massive channels who still remain unverified

164
00:14:47,180 --> 00:14:49,980
So I asked him how he did it and this is what he had to say

165
00:14:50,580 --> 00:14:53,420
Cavos is part of the YouTube network BBTV

166
00:14:53,980 --> 00:14:59,700
Sometime in 2019. He put in a request to the network to get him verified on Twitter three months later

167
00:14:59,700 --> 00:15:04,940
The network succeeded so it appears that joining a YouTube network could help you get verified

168
00:15:05,300 --> 00:15:09,300
However, most youtubers would generally not recommend joining a YouTube network

169
00:15:09,900 --> 00:15:14,060
Given how many of them take a decent cut of your pay to do basically nothing

170
00:15:14,900 --> 00:15:18,400
Occasionally, you'll get the rare goody like the coveted blue checkmark

171
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:23,380
but other than that networks tend to carry a great risk for creators with little benefit if

172
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:29,980
You have to resort to a management company. You may just want to pump and dump them like too mad, you know the vibes

173
00:15:31,540 --> 00:15:34,160
Well, literally I signed with some management company and

174
00:15:35,340 --> 00:15:38,340
They submitted me to some guy this guy named Zach Mazota

175
00:15:38,700 --> 00:15:42,040
This guy's like I was gonna verify his people a lot of gaming guys

176
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:46,720
And I mean I had no idea was coming he just let me know like at one point like yo

177
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:51,100
I also submit you for verification. I was like, oh wait, really? Yeah, they replied. They said yeah, it should be done

178
00:15:51,100 --> 00:15:53,240
Oh the way what really? Okay

179
00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:57,020
So then after a little while it happened. I just got verified

180
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:10,200
Earlier this year alpha rats successfully became one of the only accounts in history to get verified with an anime profile picture

181
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:16,880
I saw some rumors that he may have encouraged his fans to impersonate him so he could force Twitter to verify him this same

182
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:22,960
Impersonation exploit is suggested in a video by tech boomers, but doesn't appear to have worked on their own account

183
00:16:23,480 --> 00:16:27,840
Starting a mass impersonation campaign seems like a one-way ticket to getting banned

184
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:30,840
So I asked alpha rat if these rumors were true

185
00:16:31,080 --> 00:16:36,260
It turns out he actually got verified with help from eSports organization Panda global

186
00:16:36,420 --> 00:16:40,820
This explains how so many eSports competitors seem to get verified so easily

187
00:16:41,340 --> 00:16:48,220
Unlike a YouTube network eSports organizations pay you to help manage your profile, but also unlike a YouTube network

188
00:16:48,220 --> 00:16:51,300
You can't just sign up for FaZe Clan or Team Liquid

189
00:16:51,540 --> 00:16:59,180
These organizations only tend to sponsor the most elite eSports players not exactly a practical option for content creators

190
00:16:59,180 --> 00:17:03,860
Just looking to get verified on Twitter if you're looking for the most direct path to verification

191
00:17:04,220 --> 00:17:07,380
You may have to follow in the footsteps of Cowbelly Studios

192
00:17:08,100 --> 00:17:15,220
Recently, he shared this post detailing the process of how he got verified. So I asked him to elaborate on how the system works

193
00:17:15,860 --> 00:17:20,820
Basically, he hired a specialized service to have Twitter review his account for verification

194
00:17:20,820 --> 00:17:27,900
The service ran through a site called famous influencer.com and as part of the process they groomed his profile for success

195
00:17:28,260 --> 00:17:31,720
Giving him the criteria that Twitter currently requires for verification

196
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:37,800
Some of the requirements are just cosmetic such as displaying your real name and face on your profile

197
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:44,760
personally, I found this somewhat counterintuitive as your followers should be used to your specific branding and persona and

198
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:47,840
Disrupting that is definitely gonna hurt your engagement

199
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:53,160
I mean should we expect rappers to display their real names before verifying their profiles?

200
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:57,020
It seems kind of dumb to me. This place isn't exactly LinkedIn

201
00:17:57,420 --> 00:17:58,980
Here's the real kicker though

202
00:17:58,980 --> 00:18:06,200
The most important factor in Twitter's new standards for verification is whether or not you've been featured in mainstream news articles

203
00:18:06,500 --> 00:18:12,500
Now personally, I've actually been cited and interviewed for quite a few online articles one time

204
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:15,860
I even made the cover of meme insider. So where's my badge?

205
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:21,060
Well showing up in articles only takes you so far to actually get verified

206
00:18:21,060 --> 00:18:24,780
You need to initiate a manual review by a contact at Twitter

207
00:18:25,380 --> 00:18:31,660
Contact what are you talking about? The enigmatic Twitter contact is the final boss of verification

208
00:18:32,300 --> 00:18:39,480
They are people speculated to work within Twitter's communications department who serve as the ultimate gatekeepers of the blue checkmark

209
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:42,260
You could meet all the criteria for verification

210
00:18:42,660 --> 00:18:47,580
But without access to a contact the blue checkmark will forever remain out of reach

211
00:18:47,820 --> 00:18:52,900
This is why someone like nerd city who has been featured in dozens of articles still remains

212
00:18:53,220 --> 00:19:00,820
Unverified and as it turns out the lion's share of Twitter contacts are held by big companies political institutions and news publications

213
00:19:01,660 --> 00:19:08,880
If multi-million dollar brands like stacum have trouble getting in touch with one then what chance do independent creators have?

214
00:19:09,560 --> 00:19:16,000
PR agencies like famous influencer will sell you the opportunity to reach a contact for the low low price of

215
00:19:16,260 --> 00:19:20,580
5,000 pounds and that's if you already have the mainstream news coverage

216
00:19:20,920 --> 00:19:28,460
Famous influencer also has a network of mainstream press writers at their disposal to totally manufacture you into a media darling

217
00:19:28,460 --> 00:19:31,540
Of course at the additional cost of thousands more

218
00:19:31,940 --> 00:19:38,940
Over just a few years Twitter has managed to take a free feature and stick it behind what is essentially a paywall of thousands of

219
00:19:38,940 --> 00:19:45,880
Dollars and they have deliberately tried to restrict access to any information about how the verification process even works

220
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:50,980
Twitter now resembles a pay-to-win game and I'm not really sure I want to play anymore

221
00:19:58,440 --> 00:20:04,840
This site has become a permanent reminder to me that as bad as YouTube's leadership is it can still get worse

222
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:10,480
Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey always boasts about wanting to promote healthy conversation

223
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:14,040
Usually while introducing features that literally restrict

224
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:21,560
Conversation our platform promotes speech unless people violate our rules you listen to Twitter's officials talk about this site

225
00:20:21,560 --> 00:20:27,760
Like they're building some sort of utopia of erudite public discourse. Have you seen the people on this site?

226
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:33,500
It's not a vocal minority go click on any trend on the discover page and you'll see enraged

227
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:37,520
Psychopaths viciously attacking each other like someone kicked over a hornet's nest

228
00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:41,960
It's a site where otherwise calm people go to have an emotional meltdown

229
00:20:42,680 --> 00:20:46,120
Basically, if you're looking for healthy discussion, you've come to the wrong place

230
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:50,700
Well, you think this is going to cause a little more anger the world is an angry place

231
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:55,040
But you know what certainly doesn't help the harmonious temperament of the site

232
00:20:55,640 --> 00:21:00,520
Creating an arbitrary system to segregate the protected elites from the worthless plebs

233
00:21:01,160 --> 00:21:02,800
Twitter has corrupted the

234
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:09,840
Verification system to such an extent where lots of people seem to have more respect for non verified people than verified people

235
00:21:10,120 --> 00:21:16,540
The phrase blue checkmark has quite literally become a pejorative term against obnoxious verified accounts

236
00:21:16,680 --> 00:21:23,780
But it's hard to blame the blue checkmarks for acting like any other user a few months ago critical made a point about twitches

237
00:21:24,120 --> 00:21:26,520
inconsistent enforcement of their community guidelines

238
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:33,040
Specifically how certain female streamers seem immune from punishment. That's pretty much like the twitch mod team here

239
00:21:33,040 --> 00:21:37,160
Just operating in secrecy, which is the worst way of doing things with no transparency

240
00:21:37,160 --> 00:21:42,800
It just leads to a lot of confusion and a lot of bad things even for the streamers that they seem to want to protect

241
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:44,720
And I don't even know if that's the right word for it

242
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:48,920
I don't even know if they're making a conscious decision to protect streamers, but just this weird favoritism

243
00:21:48,920 --> 00:21:52,920
They seem to play in this bias leads to these conspiracy theories where you know

244
00:21:52,920 --> 00:21:58,960
All women are invincible on twitch because they're giving nude photos to the mod team for special treatment

245
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:06,520
He said that by arbitrarily protecting female streamers twitch encourages its community to unfairly target and resent them

246
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:13,040
Similarly, I feel that Twitter's inconsistent verification system has caused people to distrust verified accounts

247
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:20,480
I have no doubt in my mind that the commodification of the blue checkmark has contributed to the public's growing resentment of journalists

248
00:22:20,840 --> 00:22:26,080
People new to the site have to wonder why a random reporter with five thousand followers is verified

249
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:28,080
but their favorite youtuber with

250
00:22:28,560 --> 00:22:36,680
500,000 followers isn't this distinction can only create suspicion and discontent and it makes the site look incredibly out of touch with its users

251
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:43,240
Perhaps the gatekeeping wouldn't be as much of an issue if Twitter actually applied consistently strict standards to everyone

252
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:48,680
But when journalists get to act as unprofessionally as anyone else while flexing their I'm better than you badge

253
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:53,680
The whole thing reeks of systematic favoritism. Oh my gosh, is that an article?

254
00:22:54,800 --> 00:22:59,200
You're a journalist. That's so great here. Why don't you take about ten of these give them to all your friends?

255
00:22:59,720 --> 00:23:01,800
People may bash the blue checkmarks

256
00:23:01,800 --> 00:23:06,940
But Twitter itself is to blame for administering such a skewed system at least YouTube

257
00:23:07,160 --> 00:23:12,520
Despite all of its problems has managed to create and maintain an equitable verification system

258
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:16,680
There is no such stigma around gray checkmarks on YouTube

259
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:21,720
But still in classic YouTube fashion they had to at least try and ruin it

260
00:23:22,040 --> 00:23:27,200
Remember last year when for absolutely no reason YouTube tried to overhaul the verification

261
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:30,920
System in a thinly veiled attempt to elevate corporate accounts

262
00:23:31,320 --> 00:23:38,480
Remember how universally unpopular it was and how everyone flipped out to such an extent that YouTube backed out after

263
00:23:38,600 --> 00:23:40,640
24 hours and never brought it up again

264
00:23:41,080 --> 00:23:48,160
Well, guess what fellas that garbage system proposed by YouTube is how Twitter's verification system works right now and

265
00:23:48,460 --> 00:23:55,400
Unlike YouTube Twitter shows no signs of remorse about it. They openly mock how they deliberately neglect their users

266
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:57,400
It's all just a big joke to them

267
00:23:57,440 --> 00:23:58,080
You know

268
00:23:58,080 --> 00:24:05,680
Maybe more people would actually use this site if the management didn't treat the average user with utter contempt and it's not just the

269
00:24:05,960 --> 00:24:07,960
verification system that reflects this

270
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:13,200
Recently Twitter user lamest chris documented compelling evidence of a belligerent account

271
00:24:13,280 --> 00:24:18,920
Abusing an insider connection at Twitter support to ban innocent users without any recourse for appeal

272
00:24:19,080 --> 00:24:25,920
This is in addition to a never-ending string of DMCA takedowns in which Twitter allows trolls to submit unlimited false

273
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,000
Copyright claims with no proof whatsoever

274
00:24:28,360 --> 00:24:32,080
This is a site where you can literally post gore and pornography

275
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:35,400
But god forbid you depict cheese at hitting the World Trade Center

276
00:24:35,680 --> 00:24:41,880
Our platform promotes speech unless people violate our rules Twitter wants to be seen as a utopia

277
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:44,940
So why does using this site feel like I'm in Soviet Russia?

278
00:24:45,080 --> 00:24:50,740
The site is in general disrepair people constantly disappear without warning and the corrupt

279
00:24:51,040 --> 00:24:58,240
Delusional leadership would rather focus on a petty pissing contest with America's president than actually responding to the needs of its users

280
00:24:58,240 --> 00:25:02,720
I'm sorry, but when state um is a better source of information than your own help page

281
00:25:02,800 --> 00:25:09,080
Then maybe your site is a bit of a transparency issue. How does one acquire the illustrious checkmark on?

282
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:17,880
Twitter there's a guy named Kayvon. He's the verification god. So just go to him and he'll get you sorted

283
00:25:17,880 --> 00:25:19,880
Oh

284
00:25:21,280 --> 00:25:23,960
Brother this guy stinks

285
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:34,400
Actually as I was making this video it's been rumored that Twitter has plans to finally roll out a new public application for verification

286
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:40,000
I guess it took them two and a half years to fix something that wasn't even broken in the first place

287
00:25:40,280 --> 00:25:44,480
Who knows maybe we'll be able to trim videos again before the end of the century

288
00:25:44,840 --> 00:25:50,760
It just goes to show that the site has so little to offer that they stroke themselves off for adding features that already

289
00:25:51,080 --> 00:25:57,240
Existed should have always existed and only don't exist because of their own incompetence. I owe Twitter

290
00:25:57,240 --> 00:26:01,600
Can we get that edit button in 2020? The answer is no

291
00:26:04,840 --> 00:26:12,960
So in conclusion Twitter is a terrible platform run by terrible people where terrible users have terrible discussions about terrible issues and

292
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:18,920
For some reason this site attracts a bunch of youtubers can't imagine why but at least it's good for networking

293
00:26:19,320 --> 00:26:24,680
Because as youtubers, we know that Twitter will hold off on verifying us for as long as they possibly can

294
00:26:25,560 --> 00:26:32,760
Almost none of the information I learned in this video came from Twitter itself. It was only made possible through the assortment of connections

295
00:26:32,760 --> 00:26:34,120
I've made over the years

296
00:26:34,120 --> 00:26:40,600
So despite being a general bane on society Twitter is good for at least one thing as for the blue checkmark

297
00:26:40,600 --> 00:26:42,600
I don't even really want it anymore

298
00:26:42,780 --> 00:26:48,320
Several thousand dollars is a steep price to pay for something that should be free and the whole machine around it

299
00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:50,320
Just leaves a bad taste in my mouth

300
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:57,440
For all intents and purposes having the badge doesn't even do much you get to more easily interact with other verified accounts

301
00:26:57,440 --> 00:26:58,600
But that's about it

302
00:26:58,600 --> 00:27:05,600
None of the people I interviewed saw a huge improvement in their quality of life after being verified and it didn't seem to contribute to

303
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:07,600
any direct financial benefit

304
00:27:07,920 --> 00:27:13,140
