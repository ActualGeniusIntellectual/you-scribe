0	3700	You know, being a big YouTuber is a lot like being the captain of a big ship.
3700	8600	You're in charge of this massive machine with a ton of different parts that you don't fully understand,
8600	12500	and thousands of people depend on you to steer that machine in the right direction.
12500	18700	Every sailor knows the tragedy of the Titanic, the unsinkable vessel, the ship that was too big to fail.
18700	22700	It's a story that's been told dozens of times and it always ends the same way,
22700	25800	with the Titanic doomed to a watery grave.
25800	29100	And just as sailors should beware of the Titanic's fate,
29100	32600	so too should YouTubers beware of Leafy's fate.
32600	36500	Did you ever hear about the tragedy of Darth Leafy the Young?
36500	40700	When you look at Leafy's channel today, what you see is basically a sinking ship.
40700	43900	His channel is bleeding subscribers almost every day.
43900	47900	Like a ship taking on water, it has become completely unsalvageable.
47900	50100	There's no way to stop the bleeding.
50100	53200	The only thing left to do is watch it sink.
53200	55200	Looking at the ruins of Leafy's channel today,
55200	59700	it's hard to believe that this was once one of the most powerful empires in YouTube history.
59700	61300	So what on earth happened?
61300	65600	What caused Leafy's expedition to sail so desperately off course?
65600	68600	Why did all of his fans suddenly abandon ship?
68600	70400	Everyone thinks they know the whole story.
70400	73900	And if you ask any old YouTuber, they'll tell you the same old tale.
73900	80200	That the Content Cop, I dubs himself, heroically slayed the beast that was LeafyIsHere.
80200	81900	And that was the end of it.
81900	85000	The Content Cop may have taken all the glory for the kill,
85000	87100	but he won't tell you the whole story.
87100	88500	That's where I come in.
88500	93600	This is the real story about the rise and fall of Leafy's empire.
115000	120500	LeafyIsHere
120500	125500	LeafyIsHere opened his YouTube channel on October 7th, 2011.
125500	131000	But if you look on his channel today, his oldest videos only date back to November 2013.
131000	135000	So did Leafy just wait two years to start uploading content?
135000	139800	No, it turns out that Leafy spent 2012 doing what every other person on YouTube was doing.
139800	142100	Making Minecraft videos.
142100	143000	That's right.
143000	148800	One of the most notorious YouTubers of all time started off as just another Minecraft let's player.
148800	154000	It's really strange and ironic looking at Leafy's channel with less than 4,000 subscribers.
154000	156300	Knowing the behemoth that it would eventually become.
156300	161700	It's easy to look at a giant YouTube channel and call them overrated while discrediting all of their success.
161700	165200	But it's important to remember that every channel has to start from somewhere.
165200	169100	And most channels have to spend years working their way up from the very bottom.
169100	170600	Including Leafy.
170600	174700	Sometimes when waiting for their channels to grow, YouTubers get impatient.
174700	178600	You look at your sub count and you start to see it as a score in a virtual game.
178600	182300	That big number at the top of your channel just looks so impressive.
182300	184600	That number is power.
184600	187300	That number is influence.
187300	189800	And soon, you begin to get desperate.
189800	195600	Trying everything you can to attract a new audience and grow that number.
195600	200500	Because if you want to make it big on YouTube, you gotta have a lot of subscribers.
200500	203700	And you think you can control how much that number grows.
203700	207500	But if you're not careful, that number will begin to control you.
207500	213000	And unfortunately, many YouTubers don't realize this until it's too late.
215700	220500	Trying to produce Minecraft content on YouTube will quickly teach you a valuable lesson.
220500	223200	And that's that you're a long way from the top.
223200	226100	Everyone thinks they can just start up a YouTube channel.
226100	231300	Play some video games, and in two years they'll be driving up to their new mansion in a Lamborghini.
231300	235100	That's the image that YouTube has expertly marketed for itself.
235100	238700	But unfortunately, it couldn't be further from reality.
238700	245000	You see a guy like CaptainSparklez get millions of subscribers from only making Minecraft videos.
245000	247500	And you think to yourself, this is so easy.
247500	250500	I'm just gonna do what he does and I'll get famous too.
250500	255600	Because if you want to make it big on YouTube, you gotta make Minecraft videos.
255600	260100	This is everyone's mentality when they start their brand new YouTube endeavor.
260100	266400	What they never seem to realize, however, is that about 10,000 other people have the exact same idea.
266400	268400	Let's pretend you're driving down the highway.
268400	271700	Say you want to stop and order a cheeseburger at the next exit.
271700	276800	You pull off the highway and right down the street are a McDonald's and a Burger King.
276800	283300	Now imagine that further down the street are about 10,000 other restaurants that sell burgers that are all pretty much all the same.
283300	286800	If not worse than McDonald's or Burger King.
286800	291000	Now which restaurants do you think are gonna sell the most burgers?
291000	295300	That's pretty much how I imagine what it's like to run a Minecraft channel on YouTube.
295300	300600	The difference being that on YouTube, you never see the 10,000 other channels just like you.
300600	305100	All you see are McDonald's, Burger King, and all the money they make.
305100	309100	And that's usually enough to keep people chasing the dream for a couple of years.
309100	316700	Leafy started out as just one of those 10,000 or so channels jockeying to get his own cut of that sweet Minecraft viewer base.
316700	320400	By May 2012, he was up to 3,600 subscribers.
320400	325800	Most of which originated from his flagship series Minecraft PvP server Let's Play.
325800	330600	Who could forget classics such as Part 38, Extreme Rage.
330600	333400	By November, his sub count was over 9,000.
333400	337900	And by August 2013, he was up to almost 19,000.
337900	341800	Decent numbers for sure. Most YouTubers never even get this far.
341800	345200	Leafy's channel was almost two years old and something was about to change.
345200	349200	Minecraft surpassed its cultural peak in summer 2013.
349200	351300	It would never again be as popular.
351300	353800	Leafy had a very critical decision to make.
353800	360300	He could continue making Minecraft videos and ride that trend into the sunset on his very average YouTube channel.
360300	362100	And that would be the end of it.
362100	366900	Or he could risk everything and start searching for greener pastures.
374900	381300	There comes a time in every YouTuber's life when they're faced with the prospect of abandoning their tried-and-true formula
381300	383900	and pivoting their content to a new frontier.
383900	388000	It's a decision that I, myself, have made in the past.
388000	391000	It's pretty much the biggest gamble any YouTuber can make.
391000	394900	You build up an entire channel, an entire audience doing one thing,
394900	397900	and then you just go ahead and do a completely different thing.
397900	402700	Some channels have pivoted away from their original audience and experienced tremendous success.
402700	406200	Others have done the same thing and killed their entire audience.
406200	409700	Some channels never pivot, at least not until it's too late.
409700	411200	Remember CaptainSparklez?
411200	414700	In his heyday, he was gaining upwards of a quarter million subs per month.
414700	416600	Now he's struggling to break 10,000.
416600	420200	He stuck to Minecraft content until late 2015.
420200	424000	And by the time he tried to expand to other games, it was too late.
424000	430900	CaptainSparklez had gone from one of the biggest channels on YouTube to completely irrelevant in just a couple of years.
430900	438400	And if there's one thing I've noticed on this website, it's that if you stick to the same formula, you'll inevitably fade away.
438400	445200	However, if you shake up your style, you have a chance, just a chance, of sticking around.
445200	449700	And sometimes, that chance is enough to convince a YouTuber to make the switch.
449700	455300	Leafy showed signs from very early on that he wasn't satisfied with just patiently waiting for popularity.
455300	456800	He wanted to stand out.
456800	463600	It was likely during the Minecraft era that Leafy conditioned himself to use clickbait titles and flashy thumbnails.
463600	469900	Because if you want to make it big on YouTube, you gotta make yourself the center of attention.
469900	473500	Over the next 18 months, Leafy would undergo an evolution.
473500	477200	He would reboot his vaunted Minecraft PvP series.
477200	481500	He would expand to other trendy games, Rust, CSGO.
481500	484300	He began to experiment with new video formats.
484300	486500	He started a small vlog series.
486500	493700	But most importantly, Leafy started to dip his toe into the wild world of YouTube commentary.
493700	499100	It started with a brief three-minute rant on Google Plus in November 2013.
499100	500400	Hey, what's up, everybody?
500400	505600	Today, we're gonna be talking about the most loved comment system on the internet, which is Google Plus.
505600	510300	Actually, I lied. Everybody fucking hates Google Plus. What a fucking surprise.
510300	513900	This was the first time anyone got to see a darker side of Leafy.
513900	518400	A much more cynical Leafy that would attack a topic with ruthless derision.
518400	525000	There's just something about his pungent and nasally tone that made young, edgy people want to rally around him.
525000	530500	The Google Plus video was Leafy's first rant, and it certainly wouldn't be his last.
530500	538600	In 2014, Leafy would appear in a few crossover videos with other Minecraft YouTubers, some of which are still online today.
538600	544600	Dude, there's no way. Look at how many people. They're all drinking their pods.
544600	548600	Dude, if this works out, I will be extremely surprised.
548600	552400	Yeah, they're all drinking their pods, dude. They all are.
552400	557200	It's weird looking at these videos and seeing Leafy act so amicably and casually.
557200	561600	At times, it sounds like he's genuinely having fun with his pals.
561600	567800	Leafy may have been portraying a friendly outward appearance, but internally, Leafy was changing.
567800	571600	It was during this time when Leafy would noticeably alter his style.
571600	576200	Leafy started to implement his now notorious all-caps video titles.
576200	580400	His tone would begin to shift from joking fun to biting ridicule.
580400	585100	By February 2015, Leafy was embroiled in the middle of a major transition.
585100	589800	He had only gained about 5,000 subscribers since the summer of 2013,
589800	596300	and at the start of 2015, Leafy's videos were actually getting fewer views than they were two years prior.
596300	601300	Minecraft was diminishing in popularity, jeopardizing his flagship series.
601300	605700	His efforts were now fractured across an assortment of different side projects.
605700	608500	Jack of all trades, master of none.
608500	614500	If you asked any observer at the time, they probably would have told you that Leafy's channel was dead in the water.
614500	620000	But no one could have guessed that Leafy's channel was about to become more alive than they ever thought was possible.
620000	623500	All thanks to a small seed he planted just a year before.
629000	635500	Leafy entered 2015 teetering between making gameplay videos and making commentary videos.
635500	638800	Then, he had a delightfully devilish idea.
638800	641900	Why not do both in the same video?
641900	649200	He had actually experimented with this format back in 2014, but he truly didn't embrace it until March 2015.
649200	655700	You see, what Leafy would do is talk over gameplay footage with a totally unrelated story or rant.
655700	661500	I know this seems commonplace on YouTube today, but back in 2015, it was almost unheard of.
661500	666000	Leafy most likely did not invent this style, but he certainly popularized it.
666000	676100	Unbeknownst to everyone at the time, this method of placing unrelated commentary over gameplay footage was a formula for massive success in the YouTube algorithm.
676100	683500	Leafy could engage viewers with any topic he wanted while simultaneously keeping his videos in the gaming category.
683500	687000	This gave Leafy a huge advantage over other gaming channels.
687000	692800	He didn't have to be good at the games. He didn't have to be good at commentating the gameplay.
692800	702800	He could pump out quote-unquote gaming videos while attracting broader audiences with his more general commentary and rack up more watch time than his competition.
702800	711800	Gaming was, and still is, one of the most popular genres on YouTube, and the algorithm would begin to promote Leafy's videos far and wide.
711800	716800	But Leafy's new style of gameplay content wasn't the only thing drawing in viewers to his channel.
716800	722700	Something far more sinister was also to blame, something that Leafy had foreshadowed over his past two years.
722700	727300	Leafy began to dedicate much of his content to making fun of children.
733300	737100	In 2015, YouTube was a much more edgy place than it is today.
737100	741800	This was a time before the adpocalypse neutered YouTube's more mature content.
741800	750300	This was a time when channels like Filthy Frank were at their cultural peak, and getting away with videos that pushed the boundaries of what was acceptable on YouTube,
750300	758500	this new frontier sparked a new kind of audience on YouTube, one that craved more outspoken, contrarian, and abrasive content.
758500	762500	Leafy quickly became one of the channels to satisfy this new demand.
762500	768000	Starting in March, Leafy would begin to go all-in on appealing to the edgy part of YouTube.
768000	773400	He started three new series, Kids That DDoS, Kids That Are Toxic, Kids That YouTube,
773400	778600	mixed in with other general-purpose rants, as well as more CSGO-related content.
778600	782500	This new brand of Leafy began to pay off, fast.
782500	785700	By July, Leafy had doubled his subscriber count.
785700	791700	He surpassed 100k in August, 200k in September, and 300k in October.
791700	797200	This was presumably also the time when Leafy scrubbed his channel of all Minecraft-related content,
797200	803200	all except for this one video, which, for some reason, you can still view on his channel today.
803200	807600	Minecraft had quickly developed a reputation as a game for little kids.
807600	810900	The very same group Leafy was attacking in his new videos.
810900	816100	For three years, Minecraft had brought Leafy his only taste of success on YouTube.
816100	818700	Needless to say, it had served its purpose.
818700	821600	Leafy had moved on to big boy games.
821600	825900	Because if you want to make it big on YouTube, you gotta act like a big boy.
825900	828400	Otherwise, people might make fun of you.
828400	833400	Leafy disposed of his Minecrafter past so swiftly that it was almost reptilian.
833400	836800	Oh yeah, I should probably mention the reptilians.
836800	843100	Back in my video about Trump's rise to power, I talked about how he used memes to greatly expand his influence.
843100	846200	Well, it turns out that Leafy kind of did the same thing.
846200	848400	Enter the reptilians.
848400	852300	It started off as a small joke in an August 2015 video.
852300	855700	Yeah, but these dudes legit believe that the fucking Illuminati is real.
855700	860500	Some of them believe that 9-11 was an inside job by the reptilian brotherhood.
860500	863800	Dude, I can't say reptilian with a straight face, man. It's just too much.
863800	866400	I'm so glad you've come to join us.
866400	871700	After which, Leafy's fervent and rapidly growing audience began to adopt the joke as a meme.
871700	876100	About a week later, Leafy made another video expressing his approval of the meme,
876100	881100	and he unknowingly enabled one of the most cancerous YouTube epidemics in recent memory.
896400	897400	Yeah.
902100	907300	Leafy unleashed the reptilian army to terrorize comment sections across the internet.
907300	914300	Over the next several months, Leafy's fans would raid the comments of big YouTubers and spew reptilian propaganda.
914300	921400	The hissing and spam and KYS comments became so widespread that it prompted an episode of Keemstar's Drama Alert,
921400	925200	another channel that had been steadily growing over the same time period.
925200	933200	The man responsible for all the hissing on YouTube right now is Leafy is here.
933200	937400	This new source of attention would cause Leafy's channel to grow even faster,
937400	941500	and it certainly wouldn't be the last interaction between Leafy and Keemstar.
941500	946100	For the immediate future, Leafy and Keemstar would enter a cooperative relationship,
946100	951600	with Leafy utilizing Drama Alert as a platform to extend his reach to a bigger audience.
951600	957100	A few months later, Leafy would appear on Drama Alert to engage in a friendly insult battle with Pyrocynical,
957100	962500	another commentary channel that had a similar style of ranting over unrelated gameplay footage.
962500	965200	From what I can tell, they were all on good terms.
965200	967100	Things were only looking up for Leafy.
967100	971100	He had crafted his channel into one of the hottest properties on all of YouTube.
971100	975800	Around Christmas 2015, Leafy would pass 500,000 subscribers.
975800	979300	Just 45 days later, he would pass a million.
981600	985600	Just remember all caps when you spell the man name.
997100	998400	Leafy had done it!
998400	1000400	He had made it big on YouTube.
1000400	1002000	Just 12 months earlier,
1002000	1008400	all he had was a floundering channel that was milking the last drops of popularity from a declining Minecraft game.
1008400	1013500	In just a year, Leafy had concocted one of the fastest growing channels on all of YouTube,
1013500	1016400	equipped with a loyal and ravenous fanbase.
1016400	1020300	He started with basically nothing and created a bonafide empire,
1020300	1023400	and he did it in a way that had never been done before.
1023400	1025900	Normally, to become as popular as Leafy was,
1025900	1029100	you have to be some high-energy gamer who screams a lot,
1029100	1030600	a legit celebrity,
1030600	1034800	or a flawlessly attractive vlogger plucked straight from Hollywood Hills.
1034800	1040800	I guess nowadays you could achieve the same growth by selling your soul to five-year-olds and playing with toys for a living,
1040800	1043200	but this was before all of that became a thing.
1043200	1047200	Before 2016, there was never another channel like Leafy's.
1047200	1048800	He was barely promoted.
1048800	1051400	He wasn't smiling and laughing all the time.
1051400	1053700	He didn't have a doofy-looking haircut.
1053700	1056600	He didn't have professional-looking production value.
1056600	1059900	He was just some shady kid making rants in his bedroom.
1059900	1064200	And he reached the highest echelon of YouTube almost all by himself.
1064200	1067500	Channels like Leafy's weren't supposed to get popular.
1067500	1071700	Yet somehow, through a mostly guerilla campaign, he made it there.
1071700	1078100	And not only that, but he was leading a booming genre of content almost completely unopposed.
1078100	1082300	There was no reason to believe that Leafy's channel would stop growing anytime soon.
1082300	1085300	Leafy had become the McDonald's of his domain.
1085300	1087900	He had achieved every YouTuber's dream.
1094200	1097100	Everybody's got a surfin'
1097100	1099100	Surfin' USA
1104100	1106700	But this dream was about to turn into a nightmare.
1106700	1110200	Even at this time, even when almost everyone liked him,
1110200	1112700	even when his channel seemed unstoppable,
1112700	1115200	there were cracks forming in the foundation.
1115200	1119700	Let's just say that maybe there was a reason why there was never another channel like Leafy's.
1124700	1127700	And now I'm here to inform you of a very simple fact.
1127700	1130700	This Sunday at Backlash,
1130700	1133700	I put your downward spiraling career to sleep.

1138700	1140700	and by viewers like you.
1140700	1144700	But most importantly, by viewers like Balto Lone Wolf,
1144700	1146700	Vyteon Senpai,

1150700	1152700	Thank you.
1152700	1156700	Do you want to see more videos like this one but don't have Patreon?
1156700	1163700	If so, please consider supporting the series by picking up the new YouTube Geographic t-shirt.
1168700	1170200	YouTube Geographic?
1170200	1172700	That sounds like a pretty dead meme to me.
1172700	1177200	Everyone knows the real reason people watch this channel is for complaining and memes.
1177200	1182700	So how about supporting the real top series on this channel by buying a Minute Memes t-shirt?
1183200	1188200	Star Wars The Phantom Menace was the most disappointing thing since my son.
1188200	1191700	Hey, what's up guys? It's me, Galactron with Leafy.
1192200	1193200	Hey, what's up?
1196200	1198700	So let's talk about something we haven't for a while.
1198700	1200200	Leafy's videos.
1200200	1203700	When we last left off, Leafy was only ranting about children.
1203700	1210200	However, once he figured out that these rants were his ticket to success, he doubled down on edgy content.
1210200	1214700	He expanded his scope to booby streamers, then women and sex in general.
1214700	1220700	At first he would only talk about broad subjects, but soon he would begin to target specific individuals.
1220700	1226200	He would ramp up the clickbait, more racy thumbnails, more shocking hyperbolic titles.
1226200	1230200	He would begin to indulge himself in something known as cringe culture,
1230200	1236700	a trend that started gaining popularity in 2015, which involved roasting people on the internet for being weird.
1236700	1243200	This foul cocktail of ingredients led to some of the most toxic content that YouTube has ever seen.
1243200	1247200	And with toxic content comes a toxic fan base.
1247200	1252700	Leafy was seemingly oblivious to this, but whenever he would feature a person in one of his rants,
1252700	1256200	his fan base would often stalk and harass that individual.
1256200	1265200	An early warning sign came in January 2016, when Leafy attacked a small occult YouTuber by the name of MrBlackDarkness666.
1265200	1272700	Leafy's fans immediately went after MrDarkness, and he responded in a video where he attempted to place a curse on Leafy.
1272700	1278200	The two confronted each other on Drama Alert, where they kind of reconciled their differences.
1278200	1281700	I'm sorry, MrBlackDarkness666.
1281700	1284200	So MrDarkness, do you still want him to die?
1284700	1286700	No, no, I guess not.
1286700	1289700	Okay, hey!
1289700	1294200	It is worth noting that MrDarkness never actually lifted the curse from Leafy.
1294200	1296700	Just an interesting bit of trivia.
1296700	1304700	I still have to, like, do the... if I want the spell to end, I have to do the counter spell.
1304700	1311200	But anyway, pretty much everyone sided with Leafy on this issue, mostly because MrDarkness was such a melodramatic weirdo.
1311200	1318200	However, the important outcome of this altercation was that Leafy denied responsibility for the actions of his fans.
1318200	1326700	He claimed that all of his videos existed under a blanket state of satire, which supposedly excused him from the wrongdoings of his fans.
1326700	1331200	And I made a video about it, and it was one of those things that a lot of reaction channels do.
1331200	1336200	It's one of those things, it's like 50% like parody and like for comedy.
1336200	1340200	It's basically satire, and then 50% like an actual message, right?
1340200	1341200	Alright, alright, alright.
1341200	1346200	I mean, a little bit is on you, but you can't fucking take responsibility for every single person that watches your videos.
1346200	1348200	That's ridiculous, you know?
1348200	1354200	Why? That's bullshit. Why can't you just make another video telling them to fucking calm down and stop?
1354200	1357200	See, that's exactly what I was talking about with me and Pyro.
1357200	1362200	We were thinking about making a video talking about satire content and how we make videos about people,
1362200	1366200	but again, it's just parody and it's just your more comedic values.
1366200	1369200	It's not... we're not legitimately hitting these people.
1369200	1373700	That would all change after one video where Leafy and his fans took things too far.
1379700	1384700	Leafy would upload a video making fun of a YouTuber by the name of TommyNC2010.
1384700	1392700	Later that day, Tommy posted an emotionally distressed response, claiming that Leafy's fans had harassed him and given him death threats.
1392700	1399200	On March 20th, H3H3 Productions made a video calling out Leafy and the rest of the commentary community,
1399200	1402700	accusing them of enabling a culture of bullying.
1412700	1420700	Now, I'm sure all of you know who H3H3 is today, but back in 2016, he was producing a fairly different type of content.
1420700	1426700	Much like Leafy, H3H3 was producing semi-satirical rants and commentaries about people on the internet.
1426700	1433700	Although H3H3's content was conceptually similar to Leafy's, there were a few key differences that set him apart.
1433700	1438200	For one, H3H3 had a far less abrasive tone than Leafy.
1438200	1444200	He had a much more mellow and joking approach to his subjects, attracting a much less toxic audience.
1444200	1449200	In a nutshell, H3H3's videos made you laugh, while Leafy's made you mad.
1449700	1455700	Additionally, H3H3 often targeted figures more famous than he, otherwise known as Punching Up.
1455700	1460200	He would go after TV shows, celebrities, and giant YouTube prank channels.
1460200	1463200	Leafy, on the other hand, had a reputation of punching down.
1463200	1471200	He frequently targeted channels much smaller than his own, leading to much more harm to the victim from Leafy's overwhelming fanbase.
1471200	1477700	Heading into 2016, Leafy and H3H3 represented two diverging ends of the commentary community,
1477700	1481200	and it wasn't long before they were no longer compatible.
1481200	1486200	Due to the unprecedented amount of backlash Leafy was receiving from H3H3's video,
1486200	1489700	he quickly took down the TommyNC rant and issued an apology.
1489700	1492200	But he wasn't taking all that flack sitting down.
1492200	1496700	H3H3's Leafy rant marks a landmark moment in YouTube history,
1496700	1503700	as it sparked a chain of events that would make 2016 the most influential year in the history of YouTube drama.
1503700	1510200	Drama that intensified on March 23rd, when Leafy retaliated with the H3H3 Productions rant.
1510200	1514200	In it, Leafy revealed a series of DMs between he and Ethan,
1514200	1517200	uncovering a rather duplicitous side of Ethan,
1517200	1523200	in which he befriends Leafy just months before attacking him, while also conspiring against Pyrocynical.
1523200	1527700	Because a lot of people don't understand that me and H3H3 Productions used to be friends.
1527700	1530200	The commentary community was now split in two,
1530200	1534200	and for the first time since becoming popular, Leafy looked somewhat vulnerable.
1534200	1539200	He had never before dealt with a confrontation where a huge number of people were against him.
1539200	1543200	The H3 Leafy drama sent shockwaves across the YouTube community,
1543200	1547200	and Leafy quickly became one of YouTube's most notorious figures.
1547200	1548700	It got everyone talking.
1548700	1554200	Even a guy like Video Game Dunkey, someone who never commentates on anything drama related,
1554200	1556200	made a video mocking Leafy.
1560200	1566200	A few months later, Ethan would actually unlist the Leafy rant.
1566200	1571200	He uploaded a video apologizing for his overly personal attack on Leafy,
1571200	1574200	claiming that he was no longer proud of the original rant.
1574200	1578200	Interestingly, Ethan would quickly unlist this video too.
1578200	1580200	And you can make of that what you will.
1580200	1585200	Regardless of Ethan's true intentions, the damage was already done to Leafy's credibility.
1585200	1591200	The H3H3 rant was the first shot across the bow in the Internet's gradual turn against Leafy,
1591200	1594200	and a sign of much more grave things to come.
1594200	1599200	But once all the flames died down, Leafy would remain relatively unscathed for the next couple of months,
1599200	1603200	as YouTube's scorn was instead drawn to a very familiar figure.
1603200	1613200	Keep your hand on your gun Don't you trust anyone
1613200	1620200	After H3H3 turned on his former ally, everyone in the commentary community had to watch their backs.
1620200	1623200	The Leafy rant would go on to attract a ton of viewers,
1623200	1627200	and everyone discovered that there was now a huge audience for YouTube drama,
1627200	1631200	and therefore a huge incentive to expose unscrupulous YouTubers.
1632200	1640200	Be the first one to fire Every man is a liar
1643200	1648200	That opportunity was seized by a new challenger that you all know as iDubbbz.
1648200	1655200	On May 5th, 2016, iDubbbz uploaded the bombshell known as the Keemstar Content Cop,
1655200	1663200	a 22-minute expose that ripped into Keemstar with such surgical precision that it instantly shot him up to public enemy number one.
1663200	1669200	Keemstar, who thrived on YouTube drama, was ironically going to become its next target.
1669200	1671200	Leafy should have been thankful.
1671200	1676200	Keemstar had taken all the heat off of him, but Leafy, the eager opportunist that he was,
1676200	1681200	saw Keemstar's stumble as an opportunity to redeem himself after the H3H3 dispute.
1681200	1687200	Just a few months earlier, Leafy used Keemstar as a friendly platform to grow his audience.
1687200	1692200	Leafy would once again use Keemstar to grow his audience, this time as an enemy.
1694200	1701200	On June 13th, Leafy would launch the first strike in a series of attacks that spanned two months and four rants,
1701200	1706200	culminating in a video where Leafy claimed he was suing Keemstar for defamation.
1706200	1709200	The Keemstar rants were almost universally liked,
1709200	1712200	and they became some of the most popular videos on his channel.
1712200	1720200	Leafy rode the wave of Keemstar hate, along with his usual content, to the highest level of popularity that he ever achieved.
1720200	1724200	This was the peak of Leafy's empire. It was all downhill from here.
1730200	1736200	During the summer of 2016, Leafy still towered above all of his contemporaries in the commentary community.
1736200	1741200	On July 4th, Leafy's channel was hacked by a rogue group by the name of Poodle Corp.
1741200	1746200	His channel was quickly restored back to normal, and the Poodle Corp incident soon faded from recent memory.
1746200	1750200	This brief little incident did reveal one important consequence.
1750200	1754200	Leafy wasn't just a big channel, he was also a big target.
1754200	1761200	The internet's collective rage against Keemstar lasted throughout the summer and began to burn out towards the end of August.
1761200	1766200	During that time, Leafy had feasted on the decaying remains of Keemstar's reputation.
1766200	1770200	However, unlike old times, Leafy was the scavenger, not the killer.
1770200	1775200	For the first time in a YouTube confrontation, Leafy was not the apex predator.
1775200	1782200	That distinction now belonged to iDubbbz, a title that he would ferociously retain in the next edition of Content Cop.
1791200	1801200	Not only is his chin open to the public, no chin at all, very weak chin, lost chin, weak chin, chin implants, chin, chin, chin, chin, chin, hide the chin.
1802200	1806200	It wasn't the most meticulously researched Content Cop.
1806200	1808200	It wasn't the most groundbreaking.
1808200	1812200	It didn't have the most profound message, but it didn't need to.
1812200	1820200	The simple purpose of this Content Cop was to beat Leafy at his own game, to stoop to Leafy's level and give him a taste of his own medicine.
1820200	1824200	This wasn't a shocking expose on Leafy's character.
1824200	1827200	Everybody already knew why Leafy was problematic.
1827200	1836200	The purpose of this Content Cop was to serve as a sheer display of dominance, dismantling Leafy's content by using his own methods against him.
1836200	1845200	Any logical defense Leafy could have made didn't matter because he had a weird chin, another victory for weaponized memes.
1845200	1853200	For the first time ever, Leafy was shoved off his high perch and cast into the depths of mass ridicule and personal insults.
1853200	1857200	The very same hell he had subjected to his dozens of victims.
1857200	1861200	Content Cop had effectively swayed public opinion against Leafy.
1861200	1864200	You almost couldn't take him seriously afterwards.
1864200	1868200	All of Leafy's credibility as a ruthless cynic had been demolished.
1868200	1877200	And in the eyes of most casual viewers, Leafy's legacy was set in stone as a cowardly, insecure troll who bullies people for attention.
1877200	1880200	But more importantly, as a guy with no chin.
1885200	1888200	After the Content Cop, Leafy would never really recover.
1888200	1892200	His sub count pretty much froze at 4.8 million then began to take a nosedive.
1892200	1897200	His new uploads were bombarded with tens of thousands of dislikes from persistent haters.
1897200	1903200	His videos dwindled in viewership from several million views each to just a few hundred thousand.
1903200	1910200	Many other YouTubers followed up on Content Cop by coming out of the woodwork with their own personal accounts of how Leafy took advantage of them.
1910200	1913200	Accusing him of greedy and manipulative behavior.
1913200	1917200	As time went on, Leafy would only become more and more maligned.
1917200	1921200	No one really came to his defense. No one that mattered at least.
1921200	1927200	All of Leafy's influential friends from the past had abandoned him. He had made too many enemies.
1927200	1932200	And fascinatingly, through all of this, Leafy never changed.
1932200	1937200	He kept up the bombastic titles. He kept up the sexualized thumbnails.
1937200	1940200	He kept up his edgy reptilian persona.
1940200	1943200	He just kept charging forward, full steam ahead.
1943200	1949200	It was as if he was refusing his own fate, in complete denial of his doomed channel.
1949200	1954200	He just kept going, fueled perhaps by a burning desire to reclaim his glory.
1954200	1957200	The fleeting fame and admiration that now eluded him.
1957200	1962200	Or maybe he kept up the roasts and rants because he had forgotten how to do anything else.
1962200	1966200	YouTube fame had consumed him for the better part of two years.
1966200	1973200	Maybe the constant praise and fan worship had conditioned Leafy to accept toxic rants as part of his identity.
1973200	1977200	It was the only formula he knew that gave him the fame he desperately desired.
1977200	1980200	He no longer knew any other way of making content.
1980200	1985200	Leafy convinced himself that he would ride his downward spiral to the bitter end.
1985200	1991200	His last taste of fame came in July 2017 when Leafy got exposed.
1991200	1998200	Literally, after his Snapchat got hacked and his bare naked body was released online for everyone to see.
1998200	2004200	Ironically, Leafy's legacy ended with everyone roasting him for being weird.
2005200	2008200	After this incident, Leafy wouldn't last much longer.
2008200	2010200	Maybe reality finally caught up with him.
2010200	2013200	Maybe he could only take the hate for so long.
2013200	2018200	Maybe he finally accepted his demise after ranting about Jake Paul couldn't even save his channel.
2018200	2022200	Leafy had already abandoned his Twitter page in May 2017.
2022200	2026200	And after uploading a final rant in December, Leafy called it quits.
2026200	2028200	He didn't even say goodbye.
2028200	2032200	So that's it then. Content cop killed Leafy. The end.
2032200	2034200	But that's not the whole story.
2034200	2038200	Something else was already killing Leafy long before Content Cop got to him.
2038200	2042200	Something bigger than anyone could possibly imagine.
2046200	2052200	It's easy to sit there and believe that Content Cop was totally responsible for Leafy's demise.
2052200	2058200	And while it is true that following Content Cop, Leafy's subscriber count started a permanent decline,
2058200	2061200	if you take a closer look at the numbers, the data, the analytics,
2061200	2063200	something just doesn't add up.
2063200	2069200	This episode of Content Cop propelled iDubbbz and the series to legendary popularity.
2069200	2073200	People point to this video, and what subsequently happened to Leafy,
2073200	2078200	as proof that iDubbbz is a bonafide YouTube killer.
2078200	2080200	But is that actually true?
2083200	2087200	To date, iDubbbz has produced 11 episodes of Content Cop.
2087200	2091200	In seven of them, he has talked about a specific YouTube channel.
2091200	2097200	So out of those seven, how many do you think were directly killed by Content Cop?
2099200	2105200	Jinx is a pretty dead channel today, but his decline didn't start until several weeks after Content Cop.
2109200	2116200	The Fine Bros lost subs for a brief period, but that was due to attacks from multiple YouTubers, not just iDubbbz.
2116200	2121200	And even with that, the Fine Bros are still doing better today than they ever have been.
2126200	2133200	Keemstar experienced a significant decline after Content Cop, but after about a year, his numbers returned back to normal.
2133200	2136200	So you can't really argue that he's still a dead channel.
2137200	2143200	Tana Mongeau, you could argue, was directly affected by Content Cop for several months.
2143200	2149200	But now that a year has passed, her channel has rebounded and is currently thriving. Certainly not dead.
2154200	2161200	The RiceGum Content Cop, which you'd think would be the most influential since it's currently the most viewed in the series,
2161200	2164200	barely put a dent in his numbers.
2169200	2175200	The only channel besides Leafy that you could argue got killed by Content Cop is How to Prank It Up,
2175200	2181200	which is pretty dead today and started declining right after the iDubbbz video, so I'll give him that one.
2182200	2190200	If you've been keeping score, that's two out of seven Content Cops you could even argue directly killed the channel they were targeting.
2190200	2197200	Based on the data, it seems like Content Cop is actually far more likely to have minimal than no effect on its target channel,
2197200	2202200	which made me pretty skeptical of it being the true cause of Leafy's downfall.
2202200	2208200	And unlike How to Prank It Up, which was one of dozens of interchangeable and forgettable videos,
2208200	2212200	which was one of dozens of interchangeable and forgettable YouTube prank channels,
2212200	2218200	Leafy was a distinct entity who was leading his genre with a highly loyal fanbase.
2218200	2223200	Could one single video really stop all of that progress in its tracks? I don't think so.
2223200	2229200	And if you dive deeper into the analytics, Leafy's true killer begins to appear.
2229200	2234200	First of all, Leafy's stats show a sharp decline beginning in July 2016.
2234200	2238200	Keep in mind, Content Cop came out September 12th.
2238200	2245200	And even before the Content Cop, Leafy's subscriber rate had already dropped by 80% over the past two months.
2245200	2250200	Over that same period, his average views dropped by about 40%.
2250200	2257200	Even during the month of September, when you'd think Leafy would at least gain a temporary boost in views from the drama surrounding Content Cop,
2257200	2260200	he had his biggest decline in viewership yet.
2260200	2266200	Perhaps you could argue that Leafy's content had grown stale and that his audience had grown tired of it.
2266200	2271200	But does that really explain an 80% reduction in subscriber growth in just two months?
2271200	2278200	Let's compare that to our old friend CaptainSparklez, who took 14 months to achieve the same decline.
2278200	2287200	It just doesn't make sense that Leafy would all of a sudden fade so quickly, especially considering how loyal his audience was.
2287200	2293200	Another intriguing detail is that once Leafy's numbers hit rock bottom, he could never recover.
2293200	2300200	By spring 2017, Leafy's view count had flatlined to about 10% of what it was at its peak.
2300200	2303200	And it slowly continued to decline beyond that.
2303200	2307200	Now, this isn't too out of the ordinary for a typical YouTuber.
2307200	2312200	A lot of channels peak in popularity only to slowly fade away and never return.
2312200	2320200	However, Leafy was not a typical YouTuber, so you have to compare him to a more similar channel, like Keemstar.
2320200	2324200	Leafy and Keemstar had very similar experiences in 2016.
2324200	2329200	Both were subjects of Content Cop, both went through a period where they lost many subscribers,
2329200	2333200	and I think it's fair to say that both had a pretty similar audience.
2333200	2339200	And when you compare their stats, they both flatlined in a similar way, except for one thing.
2339200	2343200	Keemstar eventually bounced back. Not slowly either.
2343200	2349200	Over just two months in mid-2017, he inexplicably spiked back up into popularity.
2349200	2356200	And by the time his numbers stabilized, his subscriber rate had more than quadrupled from where they were in early 2017.
2356200	2363200	It was as if a giant weight had been lifted from his channel, allowing it to suddenly grow freely.
2363200	2365200	It just doesn't seem natural.
2365200	2371200	And this is where my theory comes in. Content Cop didn't kill Leafy. YouTube did.
2371200	2375200	And I'm not talking about the YouTube community or the YouTube algorithm.
2375200	2377200	Put on those tinfoil hats, everyone.
2377200	2385200	Because I am proposing that YouTube's executives conspired against Leafy to sabotage the visibility of his channel.
2385200	2389200	And this isn't just something I'm pulling out of my ass to explain away Leafy's decline.
2389200	2392200	There's a ton of evidence I found supporting this theory.
2392200	2401200	In December 2017, an anonymous user under the alias Tower Dog leaked some classified information about YouTube's internal activities.
2401200	2407200	He alleged that in mid-2016, YouTube held a private meeting with a few select creators.
2407200	2414200	This meeting had one objective. To decide what to do with what YouTube referred to as unwanted channels.
2414200	2419200	Earlier in this video, I mentioned how becoming a big channel also makes you a big target.
2419200	2425200	And back when Leafy was rising up the ranks, he attracted attention from more than just edgy teenagers.
2425200	2431200	Apparently, YouTube had become well aware of Leafy's meteoric rise, and they wanted none of it.
2431200	2439200	They most likely felt that Leafy's method of borderline cyberbullying people for fame would set a dangerous precedent for YouTube as a whole.
2439200	2444200	YouTube's higher-ups supposedly threw around ideas of channel deletion and direct censorship.
2444200	2451200	But they ultimately decided against both of those and settled on a much more discreet option of getting rid of Leafy and channels like him.
2451200	2457200	Three months later, YouTube would quietly release the system we now know as demonetization.
2457200	2465200	It took over a year after that before YouTubers started to realize that demonetization affected much more than ad revenue.
2465200	2471200	We began to notice that demonetized videos would directly correlate with poorer video performance,
2471200	2480200	uncovering a massive system of indirect censorship where affected videos would show up far less in viewers' recommendations.
2480200	2489200	After further research, YouTubers discovered an entire underground rating system that affects the monetization status of entire channels.
2489200	2501200	So, based on what we now know today, is it not reasonable to infer that YouTube may have covertly injected an early version of this system into Leafy's channel?
2501200	2507200	In other words, did Leafy become the first secret victim of YouTube's demonetization system?
2507200	2514200	I think it's highly likely. What else could be responsible for all of the strange patterns in Leafy's data?
2514200	2518200	It's just too much of an anomaly to happen under natural circumstances.
2518200	2526200	Something had to be pulling the strings behind the scenes, and I think that thing was YouTube tweaking the visibility of Leafy's videos.
2526200	2534200	It makes perfect sense on YouTube's end. They were worried about Leafy gaining too much influence and turning YouTube's culture toxic.
2534200	2541200	They wanted to stop him, but they didn't want anyone to know they were deliberately interfering with the growth of a YouTube channel.
2541200	2549200	Now consider this. Leafy can't gain any more influence if the algorithm doesn't spread his videos to new people.
2549200	2553200	And people won't notice which videos YouTube isn't recommending them.
2553200	2559200	And if you pay attention, you can see the extent to which YouTube has hidden Leafy's videos.
2559200	2564200	Let's look at YouTube search. If you search up any channel you can imagine right now on YouTube,
2564200	2570200	you're pretty much guaranteed to find videos from that channel in the first few results of the search.
2570200	2579200	However, if you search for Leafy's channel on YouTube, the first results you see aren't Leafy's videos, but other people's videos about Leafy.
2579200	2585200	Here's another example. Leafy's channel once peaked at nearly 5 million subscribers.
2585200	2591200	So based on that stat, how many views do you think his most viewed video has?
2591200	2598200	For comparison, I have around 270,000 subscribers, and my most viewed video has over 5 million views.
2598200	2605200	It's very common for YouTube channels to have their most popular video with a view count several factors above their subscriber count.
2605200	2615200	So considering Leafy's sub count was nearly 5 million at one point, you'd expect his most viewed video to have around 15, 20, or 30 million views.
2615200	2622200	Leafy's most viewed video has just over 8 million views, not even double his subscriber count.
2622200	2631200	It's bizarre, and it's probably way less than you expected. It's almost as if Leafy's videos have never been spread beyond his core audience.
2631200	2637200	There's one more little wrinkle to this theory that I discovered. Out of all the episodes of Content Cop,
2637200	2644200	the Leafy Content Cop was the only one that YouTube put at the top of trending for more than 24 hours.
2644200	2652200	And I found this fact the most interesting of all. If this theory were true, Content Cop would be the perfect cover-up for Leafy's downfall.
2652200	2659200	You may not believe it. You may think that Leafy's sudden and indefinite decline happened organically.
2659200	2664200	You may think that Tower Dog just made up his allegations of YouTube's secret meeting.
2664200	2669200	You may think that all the research and evidence related to YouTube's indirect censorship is bogus.
2669200	2675200	And even if you are the most skeptical person on the web about this theory, let me just ask you one thing.
2675200	2680200	Have you ever seen a Leafy video in your recommendations after 2016?
2680200	2687200	Or maybe everything I just said is wrong, and Leafy's downfall was actually caused by Mr. Darkness's curse.
2688200	2695200	Ladies and gentlemen, the death spell has been turned off. Drama Alert nation.
2695200	2702200	Well, no. I still have to, like, do the, if I'd want the spell to end, I have to do the counter spell.
2710200	2716200	And that, ladies and gentlemen, was the rise and fall of LeafyIsHere, from beginning to end.
2716200	2725200	So what did we learn? Well, I think the story of LeafyIsHere is a cautionary tale of what happens when a YouTuber becomes too popular too quickly.
2725200	2729200	A lot of people will tell you that Leafy deserved all the punishment he got.
2729200	2735200	Given the 12 or so months of unleashing his toxic fan base on unsuspecting victims across YouTube,
2735200	2743200	Leafy's ultimate fate of mass public humiliation and ridicule seemed like a fitting end to one of the most notorious figures on this website.
2743200	2749200	But if you look past the hate, if you look past the drama, past the fame, the fortune, and the fans,
2749200	2754200	you may realize that Leafy was only 20 years old at the peak of his fame.
2754200	2764200	That's the same age I am now. And oddly enough, looking back at Leafy's YouTube career, I noticed a lot of parallels between him and me.
2764200	2771200	We both started making videos many years ago, built up a moderate audience from making a consistent type of video for many years,
2771200	2776200	only to suddenly pivot to making more outspoken commentary videos.
2776200	2781200	Maybe it's all just a coincidence, but to be honest, I think there's a little bit of Leafy in all of us.
2781200	2786200	What person doesn't want to become a famous and successful YouTuber?
2786200	2794200	Why do you think people spend so much time and effort putting themselves into this virtual box that, in all likelihood, everyone will ignore?
2794200	2804200	It's because everyone is chasing that same dream, that image of a guy with a mansion and a Lamborghini who got rich from playing video games all day.
2804200	2813200	We fixate ourselves on the idea of making it big on YouTube, but very few of us actually think about what we'll do once we get there.
2813200	2817200	Leafy, without a doubt, started off just like the rest of us.
2817200	2823200	Except he actually got to experience that dream as a reality, and once he got there, he didn't know how to handle it.
2823200	2831200	He wasn't mature enough. He abused his power, he let his rabid fanbase run roughshod, he took advantage of his friends,
2831200	2839200	he surrounded himself with a cult of personality, and he didn't realize he was doing anything wrong until it was too late.
2839200	2846200	Leafy had become consumed by YouTube fame, and it blinded him from his flawed reality.
2846200	2854200	He was thrust into the spotlight before he was ready, and much like the fable of Icarus, Leafy rose too quickly and flew too close to the sun,
2854200	2857200	which immediately sent him crashing back down to Earth.
2857200	2866200	But was that really Leafy's fault? His only real crime was making the same toxic videos that YouTube's algorithm validated in the first place.
2866200	2872200	He did what any other YouTuber would have done. He found a formula that got views and stuck to it.
2872200	2881200	Is it really fair to judge Leafy for not anticipating that the same videos that brought him everything he ever wanted would also lead to his downfall?
2881200	2888200	It really makes you wonder, if Leafy had risen to popularity much more gradually, would he have made those same mistakes?
2888200	2895200	And as much as you may dislike Leafy's content, you have to admit that he did have a few redeeming qualities.
2895200	2900200	There's no denying that Leafy was a captivating and charismatic speaker.
2900200	2906200	Let's just say there's a reason Leafy convinced almost 5 million people to subscribe to him in just a year.
2906200	2914200	Additionally, Leafy provided a very alternative style and tone to everything else that was popular on YouTube at the time.
2914200	2922200	Call me a contrarian, but for a while it was somewhat refreshing to see a popular YouTuber who wasn't cut from the same cookie cutter template as the rest of them.
2922200	2929200	Leafy was just some unattractive guy making videos in his dimly lit bedroom, and that was all he needed to appeal to people.
2929200	2938200	And finally, you have to admit that back when Leafy was this huge supervillain of the internet, YouTube was a lot more interesting for everybody.
2938200	2950200	Do you ever think that maybe, if at any point during his rise to fame, Leafy had stopped for a second and exercised just a little bit of humility and empathy for his victims, would he have changed his ways?
2951200	2956200	And if so, would he still be as hated? Would Leafy still be around today?
2956200	2960200	And that's what makes the tragedy of LeafyIsHere so frustrating.
2960200	2964200	He had the potential to be one of the greatest YouTubers of all time.
2964200	2968200	He could have changed the way we look at popular YouTubers.
2968200	2975200	He could have opened the door for so many others who didn't fit the mold of the attractive vlogger with a Lamborghini in his mansion.
2975200	2981200	But he didn't do any of that, all because he wouldn't stop roasting people for being cringey.
2981200	2985200	Two years later, and it was as if Leafy was never here at all.
2986200	2992200	When I first started researching this topic, I expected to find myself hating Leafy like everybody else.
2992200	2996200	What I found, however, was a whole lot sadder.
2996200	3008200	When you look back at all the popular YouTubers who battled Leafy back in 2016, H3H3, Keemstar, iDubbbz, all of them went on to have very successful and lucrative YouTube careers.
3008200	3017200	And when you remember that at one time, Leafy was more popular than all of those channels, it makes his demise seem like that much more of a missed opportunity.
3017200	3024200	And in a cruel twist of fate, the death of Leafy's channel breathed life into so many others that are currently thriving.
3024200	3031200	It seems like anybody involved with Leafy eventually came out on top, at the expense of Leafy himself.
3031200	3041200	Maybe Leafy wasn't meant to get popular. Like I said earlier, there was never a channel like Leafy before, and there probably will never be another one like him in the future.
3041200	3048200	When Leafy abandoned Minecraft to start roasting people, he didn't realize that he wasn't playing a game anymore.
3048200	3055200	His subscriber count wasn't just a high score. It represented real people who would cause chaos on his behalf.
3055200	3063200	The feuds he started weren't just virtual PvP battles. He didn't realize he was threatening real egos and real livelihoods.
3063200	3070200	Leafy treated everyone like just another enemy in Minecraft. Little did he know, everyone began to see him as the enemy.
3070200	3075200	He made enemies with people who were more powerful than he could possibly imagine.
3075200	3081200	And after YouTube checked Leafy into the Black Ball Hotel, he never checked out. Game over.
3100200	3112200	Thanks for watching!
