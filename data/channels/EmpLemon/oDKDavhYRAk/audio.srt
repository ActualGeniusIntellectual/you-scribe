1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,700
You know, being a big YouTuber is a lot like being the captain of a big ship.

2
00:00:03,700 --> 00:00:08,600
You're in charge of this massive machine with a ton of different parts that you don't fully understand,

3
00:00:08,600 --> 00:00:12,500
and thousands of people depend on you to steer that machine in the right direction.

4
00:00:12,500 --> 00:00:18,700
Every sailor knows the tragedy of the Titanic, the unsinkable vessel, the ship that was too big to fail.

5
00:00:18,700 --> 00:00:22,700
It's a story that's been told dozens of times and it always ends the same way,

6
00:00:22,700 --> 00:00:25,800
with the Titanic doomed to a watery grave.

7
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:29,100
And just as sailors should beware of the Titanic's fate,

8
00:00:29,100 --> 00:00:32,600
so too should YouTubers beware of Leafy's fate.

9
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:36,500
Did you ever hear about the tragedy of Darth Leafy the Young?

10
00:00:36,500 --> 00:00:40,700
When you look at Leafy's channel today, what you see is basically a sinking ship.

11
00:00:40,700 --> 00:00:43,900
His channel is bleeding subscribers almost every day.

12
00:00:43,900 --> 00:00:47,900
Like a ship taking on water, it has become completely unsalvageable.

13
00:00:47,900 --> 00:00:50,100
There's no way to stop the bleeding.

14
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:53,200
The only thing left to do is watch it sink.

15
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:55,200
Looking at the ruins of Leafy's channel today,

16
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:59,700
it's hard to believe that this was once one of the most powerful empires in YouTube history.

17
00:00:59,700 --> 00:01:01,300
So what on earth happened?

18
00:01:01,300 --> 00:01:05,600
What caused Leafy's expedition to sail so desperately off course?

19
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:08,600
Why did all of his fans suddenly abandon ship?

20
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:10,400
Everyone thinks they know the whole story.

21
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:13,900
And if you ask any old YouTuber, they'll tell you the same old tale.

22
00:01:13,900 --> 00:01:20,200
That the Content Cop, I dubs himself, heroically slayed the beast that was LeafyIsHere.

23
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:21,900
And that was the end of it.

24
00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:25,000
The Content Cop may have taken all the glory for the kill,

25
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,100
but he won't tell you the whole story.

26
00:01:27,100 --> 00:01:28,500
That's where I come in.

27
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:33,600
This is the real story about the rise and fall of Leafy's empire.

28
00:01:55,000 --> 00:02:00,500
LeafyIsHere

29
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:05,500
LeafyIsHere opened his YouTube channel on October 7th, 2011.

30
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:11,000
But if you look on his channel today, his oldest videos only date back to November 2013.

31
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:15,000
So did Leafy just wait two years to start uploading content?

32
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:19,800
No, it turns out that Leafy spent 2012 doing what every other person on YouTube was doing.

33
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:22,100
Making Minecraft videos.

34
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:23,000
That's right.

35
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:28,800
One of the most notorious YouTubers of all time started off as just another Minecraft let's player.

36
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:34,000
It's really strange and ironic looking at Leafy's channel with less than 4,000 subscribers.

37
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,300
Knowing the behemoth that it would eventually become.

38
00:02:36,300 --> 00:02:41,700
It's easy to look at a giant YouTube channel and call them overrated while discrediting all of their success.

39
00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:45,200
But it's important to remember that every channel has to start from somewhere.

40
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:49,100
And most channels have to spend years working their way up from the very bottom.

41
00:02:49,100 --> 00:02:50,600
Including Leafy.

42
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:54,700
Sometimes when waiting for their channels to grow, YouTubers get impatient.

43
00:02:54,700 --> 00:02:58,600
You look at your sub count and you start to see it as a score in a virtual game.

44
00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:02,300
That big number at the top of your channel just looks so impressive.

45
00:03:02,300 --> 00:03:04,600
That number is power.

46
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:07,300
That number is influence.

47
00:03:07,300 --> 00:03:09,800
And soon, you begin to get desperate.

48
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:15,600
Trying everything you can to attract a new audience and grow that number.

49
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:20,500
Because if you want to make it big on YouTube, you gotta have a lot of subscribers.

50
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:23,700
And you think you can control how much that number grows.

51
00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:27,500
But if you're not careful, that number will begin to control you.

52
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:33,000
And unfortunately, many YouTubers don't realize this until it's too late.

53
00:03:35,700 --> 00:03:40,500
Trying to produce Minecraft content on YouTube will quickly teach you a valuable lesson.

54
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:43,200
And that's that you're a long way from the top.

55
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:46,100
Everyone thinks they can just start up a YouTube channel.

56
00:03:46,100 --> 00:03:51,300
Play some video games, and in two years they'll be driving up to their new mansion in a Lamborghini.

57
00:03:51,300 --> 00:03:55,100
That's the image that YouTube has expertly marketed for itself.

58
00:03:55,100 --> 00:03:58,700
But unfortunately, it couldn't be further from reality.

59
00:03:58,700 --> 00:04:05,000
You see a guy like CaptainSparklez get millions of subscribers from only making Minecraft videos.

60
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,500
And you think to yourself, this is so easy.

61
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:10,500
I'm just gonna do what he does and I'll get famous too.

62
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:15,600
Because if you want to make it big on YouTube, you gotta make Minecraft videos.

63
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:20,100
This is everyone's mentality when they start their brand new YouTube endeavor.

64
00:04:20,100 --> 00:04:26,400
What they never seem to realize, however, is that about 10,000 other people have the exact same idea.

65
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:28,400
Let's pretend you're driving down the highway.

66
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:31,700
Say you want to stop and order a cheeseburger at the next exit.

67
00:04:31,700 --> 00:04:36,800
You pull off the highway and right down the street are a McDonald's and a Burger King.

68
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:43,300
Now imagine that further down the street are about 10,000 other restaurants that sell burgers that are all pretty much all the same.

69
00:04:43,300 --> 00:04:46,800
If not worse than McDonald's or Burger King.

70
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:51,000
Now which restaurants do you think are gonna sell the most burgers?

71
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:55,300
That's pretty much how I imagine what it's like to run a Minecraft channel on YouTube.

72
00:04:55,300 --> 00:05:00,600
The difference being that on YouTube, you never see the 10,000 other channels just like you.

73
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:05,100
All you see are McDonald's, Burger King, and all the money they make.

74
00:05:05,100 --> 00:05:09,100
And that's usually enough to keep people chasing the dream for a couple of years.

75
00:05:09,100 --> 00:05:16,700
Leafy started out as just one of those 10,000 or so channels jockeying to get his own cut of that sweet Minecraft viewer base.

76
00:05:16,700 --> 00:05:20,400
By May 2012, he was up to 3,600 subscribers.

77
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:25,800
Most of which originated from his flagship series Minecraft PvP server Let's Play.

78
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:30,600
Who could forget classics such as Part 38, Extreme Rage.

79
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:33,400
By November, his sub count was over 9,000.

80
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:37,900
And by August 2013, he was up to almost 19,000.

81
00:05:37,900 --> 00:05:41,800
Decent numbers for sure. Most YouTubers never even get this far.

82
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:45,200
Leafy's channel was almost two years old and something was about to change.

83
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:49,200
Minecraft surpassed its cultural peak in summer 2013.

84
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:51,300
It would never again be as popular.

85
00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:53,800
Leafy had a very critical decision to make.

86
00:05:53,800 --> 00:06:00,300
He could continue making Minecraft videos and ride that trend into the sunset on his very average YouTube channel.

87
00:06:00,300 --> 00:06:02,100
And that would be the end of it.

88
00:06:02,100 --> 00:06:06,900
Or he could risk everything and start searching for greener pastures.

89
00:06:14,900 --> 00:06:21,300
There comes a time in every YouTuber's life when they're faced with the prospect of abandoning their tried-and-true formula

90
00:06:21,300 --> 00:06:23,900
and pivoting their content to a new frontier.

91
00:06:23,900 --> 00:06:28,000
It's a decision that I, myself, have made in the past.

92
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:31,000
It's pretty much the biggest gamble any YouTuber can make.

93
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:34,900
You build up an entire channel, an entire audience doing one thing,

94
00:06:34,900 --> 00:06:37,900
and then you just go ahead and do a completely different thing.

95
00:06:37,900 --> 00:06:42,700
Some channels have pivoted away from their original audience and experienced tremendous success.

96
00:06:42,700 --> 00:06:46,200
Others have done the same thing and killed their entire audience.

97
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:49,700
Some channels never pivot, at least not until it's too late.

98
00:06:49,700 --> 00:06:51,200
Remember CaptainSparklez?

99
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:54,700
In his heyday, he was gaining upwards of a quarter million subs per month.

100
00:06:54,700 --> 00:06:56,600
Now he's struggling to break 10,000.

101
00:06:56,600 --> 00:07:00,200
He stuck to Minecraft content until late 2015.

102
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:04,000
And by the time he tried to expand to other games, it was too late.

103
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:10,900
CaptainSparklez had gone from one of the biggest channels on YouTube to completely irrelevant in just a couple of years.

104
00:07:10,900 --> 00:07:18,400
And if there's one thing I've noticed on this website, it's that if you stick to the same formula, you'll inevitably fade away.

105
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:25,200
However, if you shake up your style, you have a chance, just a chance, of sticking around.

106
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:29,700
And sometimes, that chance is enough to convince a YouTuber to make the switch.

107
00:07:29,700 --> 00:07:35,300
Leafy showed signs from very early on that he wasn't satisfied with just patiently waiting for popularity.

108
00:07:35,300 --> 00:07:36,800
He wanted to stand out.

109
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:43,600
It was likely during the Minecraft era that Leafy conditioned himself to use clickbait titles and flashy thumbnails.

110
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:49,900
Because if you want to make it big on YouTube, you gotta make yourself the center of attention.

111
00:07:49,900 --> 00:07:53,500
Over the next 18 months, Leafy would undergo an evolution.

112
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:57,200
He would reboot his vaunted Minecraft PvP series.

113
00:07:57,200 --> 00:08:01,500
He would expand to other trendy games, Rust, CSGO.

114
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:04,300
He began to experiment with new video formats.

115
00:08:04,300 --> 00:08:06,500
He started a small vlog series.

116
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:13,700
But most importantly, Leafy started to dip his toe into the wild world of YouTube commentary.

117
00:08:13,700 --> 00:08:19,100
It started with a brief three-minute rant on Google Plus in November 2013.

118
00:08:19,100 --> 00:08:20,400
Hey, what's up, everybody?

119
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:25,600
Today, we're gonna be talking about the most loved comment system on the internet, which is Google Plus.

120
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:30,300
Actually, I lied. Everybody fucking hates Google Plus. What a fucking surprise.

121
00:08:30,300 --> 00:08:33,900
This was the first time anyone got to see a darker side of Leafy.

122
00:08:33,900 --> 00:08:38,400
A much more cynical Leafy that would attack a topic with ruthless derision.

123
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:45,000
There's just something about his pungent and nasally tone that made young, edgy people want to rally around him.

124
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:50,500
The Google Plus video was Leafy's first rant, and it certainly wouldn't be his last.

125
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:58,600
In 2014, Leafy would appear in a few crossover videos with other Minecraft YouTubers, some of which are still online today.

126
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:04,600
Dude, there's no way. Look at how many people. They're all drinking their pods.

127
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:08,600
Dude, if this works out, I will be extremely surprised.

128
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:12,400
Yeah, they're all drinking their pods, dude. They all are.

129
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:17,200
It's weird looking at these videos and seeing Leafy act so amicably and casually.

130
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:21,600
At times, it sounds like he's genuinely having fun with his pals.

131
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:27,800
Leafy may have been portraying a friendly outward appearance, but internally, Leafy was changing.

132
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:31,600
It was during this time when Leafy would noticeably alter his style.

133
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:36,200
Leafy started to implement his now notorious all-caps video titles.

134
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:40,400
His tone would begin to shift from joking fun to biting ridicule.

135
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:45,100
By February 2015, Leafy was embroiled in the middle of a major transition.

136
00:09:45,100 --> 00:09:49,800
He had only gained about 5,000 subscribers since the summer of 2013,

137
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:56,300
and at the start of 2015, Leafy's videos were actually getting fewer views than they were two years prior.

138
00:09:56,300 --> 00:10:01,300
Minecraft was diminishing in popularity, jeopardizing his flagship series.

139
00:10:01,300 --> 00:10:05,700
His efforts were now fractured across an assortment of different side projects.

140
00:10:05,700 --> 00:10:08,500
Jack of all trades, master of none.

141
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:14,500
If you asked any observer at the time, they probably would have told you that Leafy's channel was dead in the water.

142
00:10:14,500 --> 00:10:20,000
But no one could have guessed that Leafy's channel was about to become more alive than they ever thought was possible.

143
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:23,500
All thanks to a small seed he planted just a year before.

144
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:35,500
Leafy entered 2015 teetering between making gameplay videos and making commentary videos.

145
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:38,800
Then, he had a delightfully devilish idea.

146
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:41,900
Why not do both in the same video?

147
00:10:41,900 --> 00:10:49,200
He had actually experimented with this format back in 2014, but he truly didn't embrace it until March 2015.

148
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:55,700
You see, what Leafy would do is talk over gameplay footage with a totally unrelated story or rant.

149
00:10:55,700 --> 00:11:01,500
I know this seems commonplace on YouTube today, but back in 2015, it was almost unheard of.

150
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:06,000
Leafy most likely did not invent this style, but he certainly popularized it.

151
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:16,100
Unbeknownst to everyone at the time, this method of placing unrelated commentary over gameplay footage was a formula for massive success in the YouTube algorithm.

152
00:11:16,100 --> 00:11:23,500
Leafy could engage viewers with any topic he wanted while simultaneously keeping his videos in the gaming category.

153
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:27,000
This gave Leafy a huge advantage over other gaming channels.

154
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:32,800
He didn't have to be good at the games. He didn't have to be good at commentating the gameplay.

155
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:42,800
He could pump out quote-unquote gaming videos while attracting broader audiences with his more general commentary and rack up more watch time than his competition.

156
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:51,800
Gaming was, and still is, one of the most popular genres on YouTube, and the algorithm would begin to promote Leafy's videos far and wide.

157
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:56,800
But Leafy's new style of gameplay content wasn't the only thing drawing in viewers to his channel.

158
00:11:56,800 --> 00:12:02,700
Something far more sinister was also to blame, something that Leafy had foreshadowed over his past two years.

159
00:12:02,700 --> 00:12:07,300
Leafy began to dedicate much of his content to making fun of children.

160
00:12:13,300 --> 00:12:17,100
In 2015, YouTube was a much more edgy place than it is today.

161
00:12:17,100 --> 00:12:21,800
This was a time before the adpocalypse neutered YouTube's more mature content.

162
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:30,300
This was a time when channels like Filthy Frank were at their cultural peak, and getting away with videos that pushed the boundaries of what was acceptable on YouTube,

163
00:12:30,300 --> 00:12:38,500
this new frontier sparked a new kind of audience on YouTube, one that craved more outspoken, contrarian, and abrasive content.

164
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:42,500
Leafy quickly became one of the channels to satisfy this new demand.

165
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:48,000
Starting in March, Leafy would begin to go all-in on appealing to the edgy part of YouTube.

166
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:53,400
He started three new series, Kids That DDoS, Kids That Are Toxic, Kids That YouTube,

167
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:58,600
mixed in with other general-purpose rants, as well as more CSGO-related content.

168
00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:02,500
This new brand of Leafy began to pay off, fast.

169
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:05,700
By July, Leafy had doubled his subscriber count.

170
00:13:05,700 --> 00:13:11,700
He surpassed 100k in August, 200k in September, and 300k in October.

171
00:13:11,700 --> 00:13:17,200
This was presumably also the time when Leafy scrubbed his channel of all Minecraft-related content,

172
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:23,200
all except for this one video, which, for some reason, you can still view on his channel today.

173
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:27,600
Minecraft had quickly developed a reputation as a game for little kids.

174
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:30,900
The very same group Leafy was attacking in his new videos.

175
00:13:30,900 --> 00:13:36,100
For three years, Minecraft had brought Leafy his only taste of success on YouTube.

176
00:13:36,100 --> 00:13:38,700
Needless to say, it had served its purpose.

177
00:13:38,700 --> 00:13:41,600
Leafy had moved on to big boy games.

178
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:45,900
Because if you want to make it big on YouTube, you gotta act like a big boy.

179
00:13:45,900 --> 00:13:48,400
Otherwise, people might make fun of you.

180
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:53,400
Leafy disposed of his Minecrafter past so swiftly that it was almost reptilian.

181
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:56,800
Oh yeah, I should probably mention the reptilians.

182
00:13:56,800 --> 00:14:03,100
Back in my video about Trump's rise to power, I talked about how he used memes to greatly expand his influence.

183
00:14:03,100 --> 00:14:06,200
Well, it turns out that Leafy kind of did the same thing.

184
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:08,400
Enter the reptilians.

185
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:12,300
It started off as a small joke in an August 2015 video.

186
00:14:12,300 --> 00:14:15,700
Yeah, but these dudes legit believe that the fucking Illuminati is real.

187
00:14:15,700 --> 00:14:20,500
Some of them believe that 9-11 was an inside job by the reptilian brotherhood.

188
00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:23,800
Dude, I can't say reptilian with a straight face, man. It's just too much.

189
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:26,400
I'm so glad you've come to join us.

190
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:31,700
After which, Leafy's fervent and rapidly growing audience began to adopt the joke as a meme.

191
00:14:31,700 --> 00:14:36,100
About a week later, Leafy made another video expressing his approval of the meme,

192
00:14:36,100 --> 00:14:41,100
and he unknowingly enabled one of the most cancerous YouTube epidemics in recent memory.

193
00:14:56,400 --> 00:14:57,400
Yeah.

194
00:15:02,100 --> 00:15:07,300
Leafy unleashed the reptilian army to terrorize comment sections across the internet.

195
00:15:07,300 --> 00:15:14,300
Over the next several months, Leafy's fans would raid the comments of big YouTubers and spew reptilian propaganda.

196
00:15:14,300 --> 00:15:21,400
The hissing and spam and KYS comments became so widespread that it prompted an episode of Keemstar's Drama Alert,

197
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:25,200
another channel that had been steadily growing over the same time period.

198
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:33,200
The man responsible for all the hissing on YouTube right now is Leafy is here.

199
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:37,400
This new source of attention would cause Leafy's channel to grow even faster,

200
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:41,500
and it certainly wouldn't be the last interaction between Leafy and Keemstar.

201
00:15:41,500 --> 00:15:46,100
For the immediate future, Leafy and Keemstar would enter a cooperative relationship,

202
00:15:46,100 --> 00:15:51,600
with Leafy utilizing Drama Alert as a platform to extend his reach to a bigger audience.

203
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:57,100
A few months later, Leafy would appear on Drama Alert to engage in a friendly insult battle with Pyrocynical,

204
00:15:57,100 --> 00:16:02,500
another commentary channel that had a similar style of ranting over unrelated gameplay footage.

205
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:05,200
From what I can tell, they were all on good terms.

206
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:07,100
Things were only looking up for Leafy.

207
00:16:07,100 --> 00:16:11,100
He had crafted his channel into one of the hottest properties on all of YouTube.

208
00:16:11,100 --> 00:16:15,800
Around Christmas 2015, Leafy would pass 500,000 subscribers.

209
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:19,300
Just 45 days later, he would pass a million.

210
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:25,600
Just remember all caps when you spell the man name.

211
00:16:37,100 --> 00:16:38,400
Leafy had done it!

212
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:40,400
He had made it big on YouTube.

213
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:42,000
Just 12 months earlier,

214
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:48,400
all he had was a floundering channel that was milking the last drops of popularity from a declining Minecraft game.

215
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:53,500
In just a year, Leafy had concocted one of the fastest growing channels on all of YouTube,

216
00:16:53,500 --> 00:16:56,400
equipped with a loyal and ravenous fanbase.

217
00:16:56,400 --> 00:17:00,300
He started with basically nothing and created a bonafide empire,

218
00:17:00,300 --> 00:17:03,400
and he did it in a way that had never been done before.

219
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:05,900
Normally, to become as popular as Leafy was,

220
00:17:05,900 --> 00:17:09,100
you have to be some high-energy gamer who screams a lot,

221
00:17:09,100 --> 00:17:10,600
a legit celebrity,

222
00:17:10,600 --> 00:17:14,800
or a flawlessly attractive vlogger plucked straight from Hollywood Hills.

223
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:20,800
I guess nowadays you could achieve the same growth by selling your soul to five-year-olds and playing with toys for a living,

224
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:23,200
but this was before all of that became a thing.

225
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:27,200
Before 2016, there was never another channel like Leafy's.

226
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:28,800
He was barely promoted.

227
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:31,400
He wasn't smiling and laughing all the time.

228
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:33,700
He didn't have a doofy-looking haircut.

229
00:17:33,700 --> 00:17:36,600
He didn't have professional-looking production value.

230
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:39,900
He was just some shady kid making rants in his bedroom.

231
00:17:39,900 --> 00:17:44,200
And he reached the highest echelon of YouTube almost all by himself.

232
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:47,500
Channels like Leafy's weren't supposed to get popular.

233
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:51,700
Yet somehow, through a mostly guerilla campaign, he made it there.

234
00:17:51,700 --> 00:17:58,100
And not only that, but he was leading a booming genre of content almost completely unopposed.

235
00:17:58,100 --> 00:18:02,300
There was no reason to believe that Leafy's channel would stop growing anytime soon.

236
00:18:02,300 --> 00:18:05,300
Leafy had become the McDonald's of his domain.

237
00:18:05,300 --> 00:18:07,900
He had achieved every YouTuber's dream.

238
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:17,100
Everybody's got a surfin'

239
00:18:17,100 --> 00:18:19,100
Surfin' USA

240
00:18:24,100 --> 00:18:26,700
But this dream was about to turn into a nightmare.

241
00:18:26,700 --> 00:18:30,200
Even at this time, even when almost everyone liked him,

242
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:32,700
even when his channel seemed unstoppable,

243
00:18:32,700 --> 00:18:35,200
there were cracks forming in the foundation.

244
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:39,700
Let's just say that maybe there was a reason why there was never another channel like Leafy's.

245
00:18:44,700 --> 00:18:47,700
And now I'm here to inform you of a very simple fact.

246
00:18:47,700 --> 00:18:50,700
This Sunday at Backlash,

247
00:18:50,700 --> 00:18:53,700
I put your downward spiraling career to sleep.

248
00:18:53,700 --> 00:18:58,700
YouTube Geographic is brought to you by Patreon

249
00:18:58,700 --> 00:19:00,700
and by viewers like you.

250
00:19:00,700 --> 00:19:04,700
But most importantly, by viewers like Balto Lone Wolf,

251
00:19:04,700 --> 00:19:06,700
Vyteon Senpai,

252
00:19:06,700 --> 00:19:08,700
Aran9,

253
00:19:08,700 --> 00:19:10,700
and LGBTQIA.

254
00:19:10,700 --> 00:19:12,700
Thank you.

255
00:19:12,700 --> 00:19:16,700
Do you want to see more videos like this one but don't have Patreon?

256
00:19:16,700 --> 00:19:23,700
If so, please consider supporting the series by picking up the new YouTube Geographic t-shirt.

257
00:19:28,700 --> 00:19:30,200
YouTube Geographic?

258
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:32,700
That sounds like a pretty dead meme to me.

259
00:19:32,700 --> 00:19:37,200
Everyone knows the real reason people watch this channel is for complaining and memes.

260
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:42,700
So how about supporting the real top series on this channel by buying a Minute Memes t-shirt?

261
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:48,200
Star Wars The Phantom Menace was the most disappointing thing since my son.

262
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:51,700
Hey, what's up guys? It's me, Galactron with Leafy.

263
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:53,200
Hey, what's up?

264
00:19:56,200 --> 00:19:58,700
So let's talk about something we haven't for a while.

265
00:19:58,700 --> 00:20:00,200
Leafy's videos.

266
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:03,700
When we last left off, Leafy was only ranting about children.

267
00:20:03,700 --> 00:20:10,200
However, once he figured out that these rants were his ticket to success, he doubled down on edgy content.

268
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:14,700
He expanded his scope to booby streamers, then women and sex in general.

269
00:20:14,700 --> 00:20:20,700
At first he would only talk about broad subjects, but soon he would begin to target specific individuals.

270
00:20:20,700 --> 00:20:26,200
He would ramp up the clickbait, more racy thumbnails, more shocking hyperbolic titles.

271
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:30,200
He would begin to indulge himself in something known as cringe culture,

272
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:36,700
a trend that started gaining popularity in 2015, which involved roasting people on the internet for being weird.

273
00:20:36,700 --> 00:20:43,200
This foul cocktail of ingredients led to some of the most toxic content that YouTube has ever seen.

274
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:47,200
And with toxic content comes a toxic fan base.

275
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:52,700
Leafy was seemingly oblivious to this, but whenever he would feature a person in one of his rants,

276
00:20:52,700 --> 00:20:56,200
his fan base would often stalk and harass that individual.

277
00:20:56,200 --> 00:21:05,200
An early warning sign came in January 2016, when Leafy attacked a small occult YouTuber by the name of MrBlackDarkness666.

278
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:12,700
Leafy's fans immediately went after MrDarkness, and he responded in a video where he attempted to place a curse on Leafy.

279
00:21:12,700 --> 00:21:18,200
The two confronted each other on Drama Alert, where they kind of reconciled their differences.

280
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:21,700
I'm sorry, MrBlackDarkness666.

281
00:21:21,700 --> 00:21:24,200
So MrDarkness, do you still want him to die?

282
00:21:24,700 --> 00:21:26,700
No, no, I guess not.

283
00:21:26,700 --> 00:21:29,700
Okay, hey!

284
00:21:29,700 --> 00:21:34,200
It is worth noting that MrDarkness never actually lifted the curse from Leafy.

285
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:36,700
Just an interesting bit of trivia.

286
00:21:36,700 --> 00:21:44,700
I still have to, like, do the... if I want the spell to end, I have to do the counter spell.

287
00:21:44,700 --> 00:21:51,200
But anyway, pretty much everyone sided with Leafy on this issue, mostly because MrDarkness was such a melodramatic weirdo.

288
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:58,200
However, the important outcome of this altercation was that Leafy denied responsibility for the actions of his fans.

289
00:21:58,200 --> 00:22:06,700
He claimed that all of his videos existed under a blanket state of satire, which supposedly excused him from the wrongdoings of his fans.

290
00:22:06,700 --> 00:22:11,200
And I made a video about it, and it was one of those things that a lot of reaction channels do.

291
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:16,200
It's one of those things, it's like 50% like parody and like for comedy.

292
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:20,200
It's basically satire, and then 50% like an actual message, right?

293
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:21,200
Alright, alright, alright.

294
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:26,200
I mean, a little bit is on you, but you can't fucking take responsibility for every single person that watches your videos.

295
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:28,200
That's ridiculous, you know?

296
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:34,200
Why? That's bullshit. Why can't you just make another video telling them to fucking calm down and stop?

297
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:37,200
See, that's exactly what I was talking about with me and Pyro.

298
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:42,200
We were thinking about making a video talking about satire content and how we make videos about people,

299
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:46,200
but again, it's just parody and it's just your more comedic values.

300
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:49,200
It's not... we're not legitimately hitting these people.

301
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:53,700
That would all change after one video where Leafy and his fans took things too far.

302
00:22:59,700 --> 00:23:04,700
Leafy would upload a video making fun of a YouTuber by the name of TommyNC2010.

303
00:23:04,700 --> 00:23:12,700
Later that day, Tommy posted an emotionally distressed response, claiming that Leafy's fans had harassed him and given him death threats.

304
00:23:12,700 --> 00:23:19,200
On March 20th, H3H3 Productions made a video calling out Leafy and the rest of the commentary community,

305
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:22,700
accusing them of enabling a culture of bullying.

306
00:23:32,700 --> 00:23:40,700
Now, I'm sure all of you know who H3H3 is today, but back in 2016, he was producing a fairly different type of content.

307
00:23:40,700 --> 00:23:46,700
Much like Leafy, H3H3 was producing semi-satirical rants and commentaries about people on the internet.

308
00:23:46,700 --> 00:23:53,700
Although H3H3's content was conceptually similar to Leafy's, there were a few key differences that set him apart.

309
00:23:53,700 --> 00:23:58,200
For one, H3H3 had a far less abrasive tone than Leafy.

310
00:23:58,200 --> 00:24:04,200
He had a much more mellow and joking approach to his subjects, attracting a much less toxic audience.

311
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:09,200
In a nutshell, H3H3's videos made you laugh, while Leafy's made you mad.

312
00:24:09,700 --> 00:24:15,700
Additionally, H3H3 often targeted figures more famous than he, otherwise known as Punching Up.

313
00:24:15,700 --> 00:24:20,200
He would go after TV shows, celebrities, and giant YouTube prank channels.

314
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:23,200
Leafy, on the other hand, had a reputation of punching down.

315
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:31,200
He frequently targeted channels much smaller than his own, leading to much more harm to the victim from Leafy's overwhelming fanbase.

316
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:37,700
Heading into 2016, Leafy and H3H3 represented two diverging ends of the commentary community,

317
00:24:37,700 --> 00:24:41,200
and it wasn't long before they were no longer compatible.

318
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:46,200
Due to the unprecedented amount of backlash Leafy was receiving from H3H3's video,

319
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:49,700
he quickly took down the TommyNC rant and issued an apology.

320
00:24:49,700 --> 00:24:52,200
But he wasn't taking all that flack sitting down.

321
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:56,700
H3H3's Leafy rant marks a landmark moment in YouTube history,

322
00:24:56,700 --> 00:25:03,700
as it sparked a chain of events that would make 2016 the most influential year in the history of YouTube drama.

323
00:25:03,700 --> 00:25:10,200
Drama that intensified on March 23rd, when Leafy retaliated with the H3H3 Productions rant.

324
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:14,200
In it, Leafy revealed a series of DMs between he and Ethan,

325
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:17,200
uncovering a rather duplicitous side of Ethan,

326
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:23,200
in which he befriends Leafy just months before attacking him, while also conspiring against Pyrocynical.

327
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:27,700
Because a lot of people don't understand that me and H3H3 Productions used to be friends.

328
00:25:27,700 --> 00:25:30,200
The commentary community was now split in two,

329
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:34,200
and for the first time since becoming popular, Leafy looked somewhat vulnerable.

330
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:39,200
He had never before dealt with a confrontation where a huge number of people were against him.

331
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:43,200
The H3 Leafy drama sent shockwaves across the YouTube community,

332
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:47,200
and Leafy quickly became one of YouTube's most notorious figures.

333
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:48,700
It got everyone talking.

334
00:25:48,700 --> 00:25:54,200
Even a guy like Video Game Dunkey, someone who never commentates on anything drama related,

335
00:25:54,200 --> 00:25:56,200
made a video mocking Leafy.

336
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:06,200
A few months later, Ethan would actually unlist the Leafy rant.

337
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:11,200
He uploaded a video apologizing for his overly personal attack on Leafy,

338
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:14,200
claiming that he was no longer proud of the original rant.

339
00:26:14,200 --> 00:26:18,200
Interestingly, Ethan would quickly unlist this video too.

340
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:20,200
And you can make of that what you will.

341
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:25,200
Regardless of Ethan's true intentions, the damage was already done to Leafy's credibility.

342
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:31,200
The H3H3 rant was the first shot across the bow in the Internet's gradual turn against Leafy,

343
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:34,200
and a sign of much more grave things to come.

344
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:39,200
But once all the flames died down, Leafy would remain relatively unscathed for the next couple of months,

345
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:43,200
as YouTube's scorn was instead drawn to a very familiar figure.

346
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:53,200
Keep your hand on your gun Don't you trust anyone

347
00:26:53,200 --> 00:27:00,200
After H3H3 turned on his former ally, everyone in the commentary community had to watch their backs.

348
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:03,200
The Leafy rant would go on to attract a ton of viewers,

349
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:07,200
and everyone discovered that there was now a huge audience for YouTube drama,

350
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:11,200
and therefore a huge incentive to expose unscrupulous YouTubers.

351
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:20,200
Be the first one to fire Every man is a liar

352
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:28,200
That opportunity was seized by a new challenger that you all know as iDubbbz.

353
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:35,200
On May 5th, 2016, iDubbbz uploaded the bombshell known as the Keemstar Content Cop,

354
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:43,200
a 22-minute expose that ripped into Keemstar with such surgical precision that it instantly shot him up to public enemy number one.

355
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:49,200
Keemstar, who thrived on YouTube drama, was ironically going to become its next target.

356
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:51,200
Leafy should have been thankful.

357
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:56,200
Keemstar had taken all the heat off of him, but Leafy, the eager opportunist that he was,

358
00:27:56,200 --> 00:28:01,200
saw Keemstar's stumble as an opportunity to redeem himself after the H3H3 dispute.

359
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:07,200
Just a few months earlier, Leafy used Keemstar as a friendly platform to grow his audience.

360
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:12,200
Leafy would once again use Keemstar to grow his audience, this time as an enemy.

361
00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:21,200
On June 13th, Leafy would launch the first strike in a series of attacks that spanned two months and four rants,

362
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:26,200
culminating in a video where Leafy claimed he was suing Keemstar for defamation.

363
00:28:26,200 --> 00:28:29,200
The Keemstar rants were almost universally liked,

364
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:32,200
and they became some of the most popular videos on his channel.

365
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:40,200
Leafy rode the wave of Keemstar hate, along with his usual content, to the highest level of popularity that he ever achieved.

366
00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:44,200
This was the peak of Leafy's empire. It was all downhill from here.

367
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:56,200
During the summer of 2016, Leafy still towered above all of his contemporaries in the commentary community.

368
00:28:56,200 --> 00:29:01,200
On July 4th, Leafy's channel was hacked by a rogue group by the name of Poodle Corp.

369
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:06,200
His channel was quickly restored back to normal, and the Poodle Corp incident soon faded from recent memory.

370
00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:10,200
This brief little incident did reveal one important consequence.

371
00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:14,200
Leafy wasn't just a big channel, he was also a big target.

372
00:29:14,200 --> 00:29:21,200
The internet's collective rage against Keemstar lasted throughout the summer and began to burn out towards the end of August.

373
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:26,200
During that time, Leafy had feasted on the decaying remains of Keemstar's reputation.

374
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:30,200
However, unlike old times, Leafy was the scavenger, not the killer.

375
00:29:30,200 --> 00:29:35,200
For the first time in a YouTube confrontation, Leafy was not the apex predator.

376
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:42,200
That distinction now belonged to iDubbbz, a title that he would ferociously retain in the next edition of Content Cop.

377
00:29:51,200 --> 00:30:01,200
Not only is his chin open to the public, no chin at all, very weak chin, lost chin, weak chin, chin implants, chin, chin, chin, chin, chin, hide the chin.

378
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:06,200
It wasn't the most meticulously researched Content Cop.

379
00:30:06,200 --> 00:30:08,200
It wasn't the most groundbreaking.

380
00:30:08,200 --> 00:30:12,200
It didn't have the most profound message, but it didn't need to.

381
00:30:12,200 --> 00:30:20,200
The simple purpose of this Content Cop was to beat Leafy at his own game, to stoop to Leafy's level and give him a taste of his own medicine.

382
00:30:20,200 --> 00:30:24,200
This wasn't a shocking expose on Leafy's character.

383
00:30:24,200 --> 00:30:27,200
Everybody already knew why Leafy was problematic.

384
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:36,200
The purpose of this Content Cop was to serve as a sheer display of dominance, dismantling Leafy's content by using his own methods against him.

385
00:30:36,200 --> 00:30:45,200
Any logical defense Leafy could have made didn't matter because he had a weird chin, another victory for weaponized memes.

386
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:53,200
For the first time ever, Leafy was shoved off his high perch and cast into the depths of mass ridicule and personal insults.

387
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:57,200
The very same hell he had subjected to his dozens of victims.

388
00:30:57,200 --> 00:31:01,200
Content Cop had effectively swayed public opinion against Leafy.

389
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:04,200
You almost couldn't take him seriously afterwards.

390
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:08,200
All of Leafy's credibility as a ruthless cynic had been demolished.

391
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:17,200
And in the eyes of most casual viewers, Leafy's legacy was set in stone as a cowardly, insecure troll who bullies people for attention.

392
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:20,200
But more importantly, as a guy with no chin.

393
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:28,200
After the Content Cop, Leafy would never really recover.

394
00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:32,200
His sub count pretty much froze at 4.8 million then began to take a nosedive.

395
00:31:32,200 --> 00:31:37,200
His new uploads were bombarded with tens of thousands of dislikes from persistent haters.

396
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:43,200
His videos dwindled in viewership from several million views each to just a few hundred thousand.

397
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:50,200
Many other YouTubers followed up on Content Cop by coming out of the woodwork with their own personal accounts of how Leafy took advantage of them.

398
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:53,200
Accusing him of greedy and manipulative behavior.

399
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:57,200
As time went on, Leafy would only become more and more maligned.

400
00:31:57,200 --> 00:32:01,200
No one really came to his defense. No one that mattered at least.

401
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:07,200
All of Leafy's influential friends from the past had abandoned him. He had made too many enemies.

402
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:12,200
And fascinatingly, through all of this, Leafy never changed.

403
00:32:12,200 --> 00:32:17,200
He kept up the bombastic titles. He kept up the sexualized thumbnails.

404
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:20,200
He kept up his edgy reptilian persona.

405
00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:23,200
He just kept charging forward, full steam ahead.

406
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:29,200
It was as if he was refusing his own fate, in complete denial of his doomed channel.

407
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:34,200
He just kept going, fueled perhaps by a burning desire to reclaim his glory.

408
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:37,200
The fleeting fame and admiration that now eluded him.

409
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:42,200
Or maybe he kept up the roasts and rants because he had forgotten how to do anything else.

410
00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:46,200
YouTube fame had consumed him for the better part of two years.

411
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:53,200
Maybe the constant praise and fan worship had conditioned Leafy to accept toxic rants as part of his identity.

412
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:57,200
It was the only formula he knew that gave him the fame he desperately desired.

413
00:32:57,200 --> 00:33:00,200
He no longer knew any other way of making content.

414
00:33:00,200 --> 00:33:05,200
Leafy convinced himself that he would ride his downward spiral to the bitter end.

415
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:11,200
His last taste of fame came in July 2017 when Leafy got exposed.

416
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:18,200
Literally, after his Snapchat got hacked and his bare naked body was released online for everyone to see.

417
00:33:18,200 --> 00:33:24,200
Ironically, Leafy's legacy ended with everyone roasting him for being weird.

418
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:28,200
After this incident, Leafy wouldn't last much longer.

419
00:33:28,200 --> 00:33:30,200
Maybe reality finally caught up with him.

420
00:33:30,200 --> 00:33:33,200
Maybe he could only take the hate for so long.

421
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:38,200
Maybe he finally accepted his demise after ranting about Jake Paul couldn't even save his channel.

422
00:33:38,200 --> 00:33:42,200
Leafy had already abandoned his Twitter page in May 2017.

423
00:33:42,200 --> 00:33:46,200
And after uploading a final rant in December, Leafy called it quits.

424
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:48,200
He didn't even say goodbye.

425
00:33:48,200 --> 00:33:52,200
So that's it then. Content cop killed Leafy. The end.

426
00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:54,200
But that's not the whole story.

427
00:33:54,200 --> 00:33:58,200
Something else was already killing Leafy long before Content Cop got to him.

428
00:33:58,200 --> 00:34:02,200
Something bigger than anyone could possibly imagine.

429
00:34:06,200 --> 00:34:12,200
It's easy to sit there and believe that Content Cop was totally responsible for Leafy's demise.

430
00:34:12,200 --> 00:34:18,200
And while it is true that following Content Cop, Leafy's subscriber count started a permanent decline,

431
00:34:18,200 --> 00:34:21,200
if you take a closer look at the numbers, the data, the analytics,

432
00:34:21,200 --> 00:34:23,200
something just doesn't add up.

433
00:34:23,200 --> 00:34:29,200
This episode of Content Cop propelled iDubbbz and the series to legendary popularity.

434
00:34:29,200 --> 00:34:33,200
People point to this video, and what subsequently happened to Leafy,

435
00:34:33,200 --> 00:34:38,200
as proof that iDubbbz is a bonafide YouTube killer.

436
00:34:38,200 --> 00:34:40,200
But is that actually true?

437
00:34:43,200 --> 00:34:47,200
To date, iDubbbz has produced 11 episodes of Content Cop.

438
00:34:47,200 --> 00:34:51,200
In seven of them, he has talked about a specific YouTube channel.

439
00:34:51,200 --> 00:34:57,200
So out of those seven, how many do you think were directly killed by Content Cop?

440
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:05,200
Jinx is a pretty dead channel today, but his decline didn't start until several weeks after Content Cop.

441
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:16,200
The Fine Bros lost subs for a brief period, but that was due to attacks from multiple YouTubers, not just iDubbbz.

442
00:35:16,200 --> 00:35:21,200
And even with that, the Fine Bros are still doing better today than they ever have been.

443
00:35:26,200 --> 00:35:33,200
Keemstar experienced a significant decline after Content Cop, but after about a year, his numbers returned back to normal.

444
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:36,200
So you can't really argue that he's still a dead channel.

445
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:43,200
Tana Mongeau, you could argue, was directly affected by Content Cop for several months.

446
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:49,200
But now that a year has passed, her channel has rebounded and is currently thriving. Certainly not dead.

447
00:35:54,200 --> 00:36:01,200
The RiceGum Content Cop, which you'd think would be the most influential since it's currently the most viewed in the series,

448
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:04,200
barely put a dent in his numbers.

449
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:15,200
The only channel besides Leafy that you could argue got killed by Content Cop is How to Prank It Up,

450
00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:21,200
which is pretty dead today and started declining right after the iDubbbz video, so I'll give him that one.

451
00:36:22,200 --> 00:36:30,200
If you've been keeping score, that's two out of seven Content Cops you could even argue directly killed the channel they were targeting.

452
00:36:30,200 --> 00:36:37,200
Based on the data, it seems like Content Cop is actually far more likely to have minimal than no effect on its target channel,

453
00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:42,200
which made me pretty skeptical of it being the true cause of Leafy's downfall.

454
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:48,200
And unlike How to Prank It Up, which was one of dozens of interchangeable and forgettable videos,

455
00:36:48,200 --> 00:36:52,200
which was one of dozens of interchangeable and forgettable YouTube prank channels,

456
00:36:52,200 --> 00:36:58,200
Leafy was a distinct entity who was leading his genre with a highly loyal fanbase.

457
00:36:58,200 --> 00:37:03,200
Could one single video really stop all of that progress in its tracks? I don't think so.

458
00:37:03,200 --> 00:37:09,200
And if you dive deeper into the analytics, Leafy's true killer begins to appear.

459
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:14,200
First of all, Leafy's stats show a sharp decline beginning in July 2016.

460
00:37:14,200 --> 00:37:18,200
Keep in mind, Content Cop came out September 12th.

461
00:37:18,200 --> 00:37:25,200
And even before the Content Cop, Leafy's subscriber rate had already dropped by 80% over the past two months.

462
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:30,200
Over that same period, his average views dropped by about 40%.

463
00:37:30,200 --> 00:37:37,200
Even during the month of September, when you'd think Leafy would at least gain a temporary boost in views from the drama surrounding Content Cop,

464
00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:40,200
he had his biggest decline in viewership yet.

465
00:37:40,200 --> 00:37:46,200
Perhaps you could argue that Leafy's content had grown stale and that his audience had grown tired of it.

466
00:37:46,200 --> 00:37:51,200
But does that really explain an 80% reduction in subscriber growth in just two months?

467
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:58,200
Let's compare that to our old friend CaptainSparklez, who took 14 months to achieve the same decline.

468
00:37:58,200 --> 00:38:07,200
It just doesn't make sense that Leafy would all of a sudden fade so quickly, especially considering how loyal his audience was.

469
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:13,200
Another intriguing detail is that once Leafy's numbers hit rock bottom, he could never recover.

470
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:20,200
By spring 2017, Leafy's view count had flatlined to about 10% of what it was at its peak.

471
00:38:20,200 --> 00:38:23,200
And it slowly continued to decline beyond that.

472
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:27,200
Now, this isn't too out of the ordinary for a typical YouTuber.

473
00:38:27,200 --> 00:38:32,200
A lot of channels peak in popularity only to slowly fade away and never return.

474
00:38:32,200 --> 00:38:40,200
However, Leafy was not a typical YouTuber, so you have to compare him to a more similar channel, like Keemstar.

475
00:38:40,200 --> 00:38:44,200
Leafy and Keemstar had very similar experiences in 2016.

476
00:38:44,200 --> 00:38:49,200
Both were subjects of Content Cop, both went through a period where they lost many subscribers,

477
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:53,200
and I think it's fair to say that both had a pretty similar audience.

478
00:38:53,200 --> 00:38:59,200
And when you compare their stats, they both flatlined in a similar way, except for one thing.

479
00:38:59,200 --> 00:39:03,200
Keemstar eventually bounced back. Not slowly either.

480
00:39:03,200 --> 00:39:09,200
Over just two months in mid-2017, he inexplicably spiked back up into popularity.

481
00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:16,200
And by the time his numbers stabilized, his subscriber rate had more than quadrupled from where they were in early 2017.

482
00:39:16,200 --> 00:39:23,200
It was as if a giant weight had been lifted from his channel, allowing it to suddenly grow freely.

483
00:39:23,200 --> 00:39:25,200
It just doesn't seem natural.

484
00:39:25,200 --> 00:39:31,200
And this is where my theory comes in. Content Cop didn't kill Leafy. YouTube did.

485
00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:35,200
And I'm not talking about the YouTube community or the YouTube algorithm.

486
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:37,200
Put on those tinfoil hats, everyone.

487
00:39:37,200 --> 00:39:45,200
Because I am proposing that YouTube's executives conspired against Leafy to sabotage the visibility of his channel.

488
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:49,200
And this isn't just something I'm pulling out of my ass to explain away Leafy's decline.

489
00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:52,200
There's a ton of evidence I found supporting this theory.

490
00:39:52,200 --> 00:40:01,200
In December 2017, an anonymous user under the alias Tower Dog leaked some classified information about YouTube's internal activities.

491
00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:07,200
He alleged that in mid-2016, YouTube held a private meeting with a few select creators.

492
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:14,200
This meeting had one objective. To decide what to do with what YouTube referred to as unwanted channels.

493
00:40:14,200 --> 00:40:19,200
Earlier in this video, I mentioned how becoming a big channel also makes you a big target.

494
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:25,200
And back when Leafy was rising up the ranks, he attracted attention from more than just edgy teenagers.

495
00:40:25,200 --> 00:40:31,200
Apparently, YouTube had become well aware of Leafy's meteoric rise, and they wanted none of it.

496
00:40:31,200 --> 00:40:39,200
They most likely felt that Leafy's method of borderline cyberbullying people for fame would set a dangerous precedent for YouTube as a whole.

497
00:40:39,200 --> 00:40:44,200
YouTube's higher-ups supposedly threw around ideas of channel deletion and direct censorship.

498
00:40:44,200 --> 00:40:51,200
But they ultimately decided against both of those and settled on a much more discreet option of getting rid of Leafy and channels like him.

499
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:57,200
Three months later, YouTube would quietly release the system we now know as demonetization.

500
00:40:57,200 --> 00:41:05,200
It took over a year after that before YouTubers started to realize that demonetization affected much more than ad revenue.

501
00:41:05,200 --> 00:41:11,200
We began to notice that demonetized videos would directly correlate with poorer video performance,

502
00:41:11,200 --> 00:41:20,200
uncovering a massive system of indirect censorship where affected videos would show up far less in viewers' recommendations.

503
00:41:20,200 --> 00:41:29,200
After further research, YouTubers discovered an entire underground rating system that affects the monetization status of entire channels.

504
00:41:29,200 --> 00:41:41,200
So, based on what we now know today, is it not reasonable to infer that YouTube may have covertly injected an early version of this system into Leafy's channel?

505
00:41:41,200 --> 00:41:47,200
In other words, did Leafy become the first secret victim of YouTube's demonetization system?

506
00:41:47,200 --> 00:41:54,200
I think it's highly likely. What else could be responsible for all of the strange patterns in Leafy's data?

507
00:41:54,200 --> 00:41:58,200
It's just too much of an anomaly to happen under natural circumstances.

508
00:41:58,200 --> 00:42:06,200
Something had to be pulling the strings behind the scenes, and I think that thing was YouTube tweaking the visibility of Leafy's videos.

509
00:42:06,200 --> 00:42:14,200
It makes perfect sense on YouTube's end. They were worried about Leafy gaining too much influence and turning YouTube's culture toxic.

510
00:42:14,200 --> 00:42:21,200
They wanted to stop him, but they didn't want anyone to know they were deliberately interfering with the growth of a YouTube channel.

511
00:42:21,200 --> 00:42:29,200
Now consider this. Leafy can't gain any more influence if the algorithm doesn't spread his videos to new people.

512
00:42:29,200 --> 00:42:33,200
And people won't notice which videos YouTube isn't recommending them.

513
00:42:33,200 --> 00:42:39,200
And if you pay attention, you can see the extent to which YouTube has hidden Leafy's videos.

514
00:42:39,200 --> 00:42:44,200
Let's look at YouTube search. If you search up any channel you can imagine right now on YouTube,

515
00:42:44,200 --> 00:42:50,200
you're pretty much guaranteed to find videos from that channel in the first few results of the search.

516
00:42:50,200 --> 00:42:59,200
However, if you search for Leafy's channel on YouTube, the first results you see aren't Leafy's videos, but other people's videos about Leafy.

517
00:42:59,200 --> 00:43:05,200
Here's another example. Leafy's channel once peaked at nearly 5 million subscribers.

518
00:43:05,200 --> 00:43:11,200
So based on that stat, how many views do you think his most viewed video has?

519
00:43:11,200 --> 00:43:18,200
For comparison, I have around 270,000 subscribers, and my most viewed video has over 5 million views.

520
00:43:18,200 --> 00:43:25,200
It's very common for YouTube channels to have their most popular video with a view count several factors above their subscriber count.

521
00:43:25,200 --> 00:43:35,200
So considering Leafy's sub count was nearly 5 million at one point, you'd expect his most viewed video to have around 15, 20, or 30 million views.

522
00:43:35,200 --> 00:43:42,200
Leafy's most viewed video has just over 8 million views, not even double his subscriber count.

523
00:43:42,200 --> 00:43:51,200
It's bizarre, and it's probably way less than you expected. It's almost as if Leafy's videos have never been spread beyond his core audience.

524
00:43:51,200 --> 00:43:57,200
There's one more little wrinkle to this theory that I discovered. Out of all the episodes of Content Cop,

525
00:43:57,200 --> 00:44:04,200
the Leafy Content Cop was the only one that YouTube put at the top of trending for more than 24 hours.

526
00:44:04,200 --> 00:44:12,200
And I found this fact the most interesting of all. If this theory were true, Content Cop would be the perfect cover-up for Leafy's downfall.

527
00:44:12,200 --> 00:44:19,200
You may not believe it. You may think that Leafy's sudden and indefinite decline happened organically.

528
00:44:19,200 --> 00:44:24,200
You may think that Tower Dog just made up his allegations of YouTube's secret meeting.

529
00:44:24,200 --> 00:44:29,200
You may think that all the research and evidence related to YouTube's indirect censorship is bogus.

530
00:44:29,200 --> 00:44:35,200
And even if you are the most skeptical person on the web about this theory, let me just ask you one thing.

531
00:44:35,200 --> 00:44:40,200
Have you ever seen a Leafy video in your recommendations after 2016?

532
00:44:40,200 --> 00:44:47,200
Or maybe everything I just said is wrong, and Leafy's downfall was actually caused by Mr. Darkness's curse.

533
00:44:48,200 --> 00:44:55,200
Ladies and gentlemen, the death spell has been turned off. Drama Alert nation.

534
00:44:55,200 --> 00:45:02,200
Well, no. I still have to, like, do the, if I'd want the spell to end, I have to do the counter spell.

535
00:45:10,200 --> 00:45:16,200
And that, ladies and gentlemen, was the rise and fall of LeafyIsHere, from beginning to end.

536
00:45:16,200 --> 00:45:25,200
So what did we learn? Well, I think the story of LeafyIsHere is a cautionary tale of what happens when a YouTuber becomes too popular too quickly.

537
00:45:25,200 --> 00:45:29,200
A lot of people will tell you that Leafy deserved all the punishment he got.

538
00:45:29,200 --> 00:45:35,200
Given the 12 or so months of unleashing his toxic fan base on unsuspecting victims across YouTube,

539
00:45:35,200 --> 00:45:43,200
Leafy's ultimate fate of mass public humiliation and ridicule seemed like a fitting end to one of the most notorious figures on this website.

540
00:45:43,200 --> 00:45:49,200
But if you look past the hate, if you look past the drama, past the fame, the fortune, and the fans,

541
00:45:49,200 --> 00:45:54,200
you may realize that Leafy was only 20 years old at the peak of his fame.

542
00:45:54,200 --> 00:46:04,200
That's the same age I am now. And oddly enough, looking back at Leafy's YouTube career, I noticed a lot of parallels between him and me.

543
00:46:04,200 --> 00:46:11,200
We both started making videos many years ago, built up a moderate audience from making a consistent type of video for many years,

544
00:46:11,200 --> 00:46:16,200
only to suddenly pivot to making more outspoken commentary videos.

545
00:46:16,200 --> 00:46:21,200
Maybe it's all just a coincidence, but to be honest, I think there's a little bit of Leafy in all of us.

546
00:46:21,200 --> 00:46:26,200
What person doesn't want to become a famous and successful YouTuber?

547
00:46:26,200 --> 00:46:34,200
Why do you think people spend so much time and effort putting themselves into this virtual box that, in all likelihood, everyone will ignore?

548
00:46:34,200 --> 00:46:44,200
It's because everyone is chasing that same dream, that image of a guy with a mansion and a Lamborghini who got rich from playing video games all day.

549
00:46:44,200 --> 00:46:53,200
We fixate ourselves on the idea of making it big on YouTube, but very few of us actually think about what we'll do once we get there.

550
00:46:53,200 --> 00:46:57,200
Leafy, without a doubt, started off just like the rest of us.

551
00:46:57,200 --> 00:47:03,200
Except he actually got to experience that dream as a reality, and once he got there, he didn't know how to handle it.

552
00:47:03,200 --> 00:47:11,200
He wasn't mature enough. He abused his power, he let his rabid fanbase run roughshod, he took advantage of his friends,

553
00:47:11,200 --> 00:47:19,200
he surrounded himself with a cult of personality, and he didn't realize he was doing anything wrong until it was too late.

554
00:47:19,200 --> 00:47:26,200
Leafy had become consumed by YouTube fame, and it blinded him from his flawed reality.

555
00:47:26,200 --> 00:47:34,200
He was thrust into the spotlight before he was ready, and much like the fable of Icarus, Leafy rose too quickly and flew too close to the sun,

556
00:47:34,200 --> 00:47:37,200
which immediately sent him crashing back down to Earth.

557
00:47:37,200 --> 00:47:46,200
But was that really Leafy's fault? His only real crime was making the same toxic videos that YouTube's algorithm validated in the first place.

558
00:47:46,200 --> 00:47:52,200
He did what any other YouTuber would have done. He found a formula that got views and stuck to it.

559
00:47:52,200 --> 00:48:01,200
Is it really fair to judge Leafy for not anticipating that the same videos that brought him everything he ever wanted would also lead to his downfall?

560
00:48:01,200 --> 00:48:08,200
It really makes you wonder, if Leafy had risen to popularity much more gradually, would he have made those same mistakes?

561
00:48:08,200 --> 00:48:15,200
And as much as you may dislike Leafy's content, you have to admit that he did have a few redeeming qualities.

562
00:48:15,200 --> 00:48:20,200
There's no denying that Leafy was a captivating and charismatic speaker.

563
00:48:20,200 --> 00:48:26,200
Let's just say there's a reason Leafy convinced almost 5 million people to subscribe to him in just a year.

564
00:48:26,200 --> 00:48:34,200
Additionally, Leafy provided a very alternative style and tone to everything else that was popular on YouTube at the time.

565
00:48:34,200 --> 00:48:42,200
Call me a contrarian, but for a while it was somewhat refreshing to see a popular YouTuber who wasn't cut from the same cookie cutter template as the rest of them.

566
00:48:42,200 --> 00:48:49,200
Leafy was just some unattractive guy making videos in his dimly lit bedroom, and that was all he needed to appeal to people.

567
00:48:49,200 --> 00:48:58,200
And finally, you have to admit that back when Leafy was this huge supervillain of the internet, YouTube was a lot more interesting for everybody.

568
00:48:58,200 --> 00:49:10,200
Do you ever think that maybe, if at any point during his rise to fame, Leafy had stopped for a second and exercised just a little bit of humility and empathy for his victims, would he have changed his ways?

569
00:49:11,200 --> 00:49:16,200
And if so, would he still be as hated? Would Leafy still be around today?

570
00:49:16,200 --> 00:49:20,200
And that's what makes the tragedy of LeafyIsHere so frustrating.

571
00:49:20,200 --> 00:49:24,200
He had the potential to be one of the greatest YouTubers of all time.

572
00:49:24,200 --> 00:49:28,200
He could have changed the way we look at popular YouTubers.

573
00:49:28,200 --> 00:49:35,200
He could have opened the door for so many others who didn't fit the mold of the attractive vlogger with a Lamborghini in his mansion.

574
00:49:35,200 --> 00:49:41,200
But he didn't do any of that, all because he wouldn't stop roasting people for being cringey.

575
00:49:41,200 --> 00:49:45,200
Two years later, and it was as if Leafy was never here at all.

576
00:49:46,200 --> 00:49:52,200
When I first started researching this topic, I expected to find myself hating Leafy like everybody else.

577
00:49:52,200 --> 00:49:56,200
What I found, however, was a whole lot sadder.

578
00:49:56,200 --> 00:50:08,200
When you look back at all the popular YouTubers who battled Leafy back in 2016, H3H3, Keemstar, iDubbbz, all of them went on to have very successful and lucrative YouTube careers.

579
00:50:08,200 --> 00:50:17,200
And when you remember that at one time, Leafy was more popular than all of those channels, it makes his demise seem like that much more of a missed opportunity.

580
00:50:17,200 --> 00:50:24,200
And in a cruel twist of fate, the death of Leafy's channel breathed life into so many others that are currently thriving.

581
00:50:24,200 --> 00:50:31,200
It seems like anybody involved with Leafy eventually came out on top, at the expense of Leafy himself.

582
00:50:31,200 --> 00:50:41,200
Maybe Leafy wasn't meant to get popular. Like I said earlier, there was never a channel like Leafy before, and there probably will never be another one like him in the future.

583
00:50:41,200 --> 00:50:48,200
When Leafy abandoned Minecraft to start roasting people, he didn't realize that he wasn't playing a game anymore.

584
00:50:48,200 --> 00:50:55,200
His subscriber count wasn't just a high score. It represented real people who would cause chaos on his behalf.

585
00:50:55,200 --> 00:51:03,200
The feuds he started weren't just virtual PvP battles. He didn't realize he was threatening real egos and real livelihoods.

586
00:51:03,200 --> 00:51:10,200
Leafy treated everyone like just another enemy in Minecraft. Little did he know, everyone began to see him as the enemy.

587
00:51:10,200 --> 00:51:15,200
He made enemies with people who were more powerful than he could possibly imagine.

588
00:51:15,200 --> 00:51:21,200
And after YouTube checked Leafy into the Black Ball Hotel, he never checked out. Game over.

589
00:51:40,200 --> 00:51:52,200
Thanks for watching!
