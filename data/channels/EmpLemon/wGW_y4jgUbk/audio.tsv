0	17480	It's a pretty funny meme, but I feel that much of the humor comes from the source rather
17480	18480	than the meme itself.
18480	23600	I haven't seen too much variability beyond just changing location, but overall it's
23600	26920	a decent meme.
26920	30600	And it's pretty funny, but each version feels a little interchangeable, this time on the
30600	31680	editing end.
31680	34100	Each of these memes feels more or less the same.
34100	40480	This meme is sort of the converse of the Drake and Josh one, and it gets the same score.
40480	42220	I really like this meme.
42220	47480	It has many different iterations, and I really enjoy how it deconstructs the nature of argumentation
47480	48480	on the internet.
48480	51600	It's pretty much the most you can expect from an image meme.
51600	58680	Oh wow, a low-effort Twitter meme about aging.
58680	66280	Oh wow, a low-effort Twitter meme about stars falling on a character.
66280	72160	Oh wow, a low-effort relatable Twitter meme that's literally just another screenshot
72160	76460	from the same SpongeBob episode as Savage Patrick, literally the same scene.
76460	78040	Just stop, okay?
78040	82720	All this millennial humor or whatever the fuck you people call it is painfully unfunny.
82720	88040	Ooh, when you drop your iPhone X in the Starbucks room, it's so relatable.
88040	89040	Fuck this generation.
89040	91800	Enough is enough!
91800	93840	This meme is just annoying.
93840	96120	Not funny, not clever, just annoying.
96120	100840	Normies seem to love this meme, and they have forced it to Ellen show levels of popularity.
100840	102820	Shut up!
102820	108500	This meme has basically just changed my mind, but for Tumblr people, whatever.
108500	109500	This meme is alright.
109500	113980	It's a pretty clever way of portraying the idea of an ulterior killer through various
113980	114980	situations.
114980	121020	I wouldn't be surprised if Eric Andre memes continue to rise in the future.
121020	124700	This is an interesting little crypto meme that has stayed pretty underground so far.
124700	129140	It has a low risk of overexposure, and I'm interested to see whether this meme will continue
129140	131340	to develop or just fade away.
131380	133060	For now, it's a B-.
133060	134060	AHHH!
134060	135060	Oh!
135060	136060	Oh!
136060	137060	Oh!
137060	138060	Oh!
138060	139060	Oh!
139060	140060	Oh!
140060	141060	Oh!
141060	142060	Oh!
142060	143060	Oh!
143060	144060	Well, that's all the memes for April.
144060	145060	Some good, some not so good.
145060	146060	Were there any that I missed?
146060	146560	Probably.
