It's a pretty funny meme, but I feel that much of the humor comes from the source rather

00:17.480 --> 00:18.480
than the meme itself.

00:18.480 --> 00:23.600
I haven't seen too much variability beyond just changing location, but overall it's

00:23.600 --> 00:26.920
a decent meme.

00:26.920 --> 00:30.600
And it's pretty funny, but each version feels a little interchangeable, this time on the

00:30.600 --> 00:31.680
editing end.

00:31.680 --> 00:34.100
Each of these memes feels more or less the same.

00:34.100 --> 00:40.480
This meme is sort of the converse of the Drake and Josh one, and it gets the same score.

00:40.480 --> 00:42.220
I really like this meme.

00:42.220 --> 00:47.480
It has many different iterations, and I really enjoy how it deconstructs the nature of argumentation

00:47.480 --> 00:48.480
on the internet.

00:48.480 --> 00:51.600
It's pretty much the most you can expect from an image meme.

00:51.600 --> 00:58.680
Oh wow, a low-effort Twitter meme about aging.

00:58.680 --> 01:06.280
Oh wow, a low-effort Twitter meme about stars falling on a character.

01:06.280 --> 01:12.160
Oh wow, a low-effort relatable Twitter meme that's literally just another screenshot

01:12.160 --> 01:16.460
from the same SpongeBob episode as Savage Patrick, literally the same scene.

01:16.460 --> 01:18.040
Just stop, okay?

01:18.040 --> 01:22.720
All this millennial humor or whatever the fuck you people call it is painfully unfunny.

01:22.720 --> 01:28.040
Ooh, when you drop your iPhone X in the Starbucks room, it's so relatable.

01:28.040 --> 01:29.040
Fuck this generation.

01:29.040 --> 01:31.800
Enough is enough!

01:31.800 --> 01:33.840
This meme is just annoying.

01:33.840 --> 01:36.120
Not funny, not clever, just annoying.

01:36.120 --> 01:40.840
Normies seem to love this meme, and they have forced it to Ellen show levels of popularity.

01:40.840 --> 01:42.820
Shut up!

01:42.820 --> 01:48.500
This meme has basically just changed my mind, but for Tumblr people, whatever.

01:48.500 --> 01:49.500
This meme is alright.

01:49.500 --> 01:53.980
It's a pretty clever way of portraying the idea of an ulterior killer through various

01:53.980 --> 01:54.980
situations.

01:54.980 --> 02:01.020
I wouldn't be surprised if Eric Andre memes continue to rise in the future.

02:01.020 --> 02:04.700
This is an interesting little crypto meme that has stayed pretty underground so far.

02:04.700 --> 02:09.140
It has a low risk of overexposure, and I'm interested to see whether this meme will continue

02:09.140 --> 02:11.340
to develop or just fade away.

02:11.380 --> 02:13.060
For now, it's a B-.

02:13.060 --> 02:14.060
AHHH!

02:14.060 --> 02:15.060
Oh!

02:15.060 --> 02:16.060
Oh!

02:16.060 --> 02:17.060
Oh!

02:17.060 --> 02:18.060
Oh!

02:18.060 --> 02:19.060
Oh!

02:19.060 --> 02:20.060
Oh!

02:20.060 --> 02:21.060
Oh!

02:21.060 --> 02:22.060
Oh!

02:22.060 --> 02:23.060
Oh!

02:23.060 --> 02:24.060
Well, that's all the memes for April.

02:24.060 --> 02:25.060
Some good, some not so good.

02:25.060 --> 02:26.060
Were there any that I missed?

02:26.060 --> 02:26.560
Probably.
