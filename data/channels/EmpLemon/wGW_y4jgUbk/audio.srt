1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:17,480
It's a pretty funny meme, but I feel that much of the humor comes from the source rather

2
00:00:17,480 --> 00:00:18,480
than the meme itself.

3
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:23,600
I haven't seen too much variability beyond just changing location, but overall it's

4
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:26,920
a decent meme.

5
00:00:26,920 --> 00:00:30,600
And it's pretty funny, but each version feels a little interchangeable, this time on the

6
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:31,680
editing end.

7
00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:34,100
Each of these memes feels more or less the same.

8
00:00:34,100 --> 00:00:40,480
This meme is sort of the converse of the Drake and Josh one, and it gets the same score.

9
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:42,220
I really like this meme.

10
00:00:42,220 --> 00:00:47,480
It has many different iterations, and I really enjoy how it deconstructs the nature of argumentation

11
00:00:47,480 --> 00:00:48,480
on the internet.

12
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:51,600
It's pretty much the most you can expect from an image meme.

13
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:58,680
Oh wow, a low-effort Twitter meme about aging.

14
00:00:58,680 --> 00:01:06,280
Oh wow, a low-effort Twitter meme about stars falling on a character.

15
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:12,160
Oh wow, a low-effort relatable Twitter meme that's literally just another screenshot

16
00:01:12,160 --> 00:01:16,460
from the same SpongeBob episode as Savage Patrick, literally the same scene.

17
00:01:16,460 --> 00:01:18,040
Just stop, okay?

18
00:01:18,040 --> 00:01:22,720
All this millennial humor or whatever the fuck you people call it is painfully unfunny.

19
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:28,040
Ooh, when you drop your iPhone X in the Starbucks room, it's so relatable.

20
00:01:28,040 --> 00:01:29,040
Fuck this generation.

21
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:31,800
Enough is enough!

22
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:33,840
This meme is just annoying.

23
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:36,120
Not funny, not clever, just annoying.

24
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:40,840
Normies seem to love this meme, and they have forced it to Ellen show levels of popularity.

25
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:42,820
Shut up!

26
00:01:42,820 --> 00:01:48,500
This meme has basically just changed my mind, but for Tumblr people, whatever.

27
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:49,500
This meme is alright.

28
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:53,980
It's a pretty clever way of portraying the idea of an ulterior killer through various

29
00:01:53,980 --> 00:01:54,980
situations.

30
00:01:54,980 --> 00:02:01,020
I wouldn't be surprised if Eric Andre memes continue to rise in the future.

31
00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:04,700
This is an interesting little crypto meme that has stayed pretty underground so far.

32
00:02:04,700 --> 00:02:09,140
It has a low risk of overexposure, and I'm interested to see whether this meme will continue

33
00:02:09,140 --> 00:02:11,340
to develop or just fade away.

34
00:02:11,380 --> 00:02:13,060
For now, it's a B-.

35
00:02:13,060 --> 00:02:14,060
AHHH!

36
00:02:14,060 --> 00:02:15,060
Oh!

37
00:02:15,060 --> 00:02:16,060
Oh!

38
00:02:16,060 --> 00:02:17,060
Oh!

39
00:02:17,060 --> 00:02:18,060
Oh!

40
00:02:18,060 --> 00:02:19,060
Oh!

41
00:02:19,060 --> 00:02:20,060
Oh!

42
00:02:20,060 --> 00:02:21,060
Oh!

43
00:02:21,060 --> 00:02:22,060
Oh!

44
00:02:22,060 --> 00:02:23,060
Oh!

45
00:02:23,060 --> 00:02:24,060
Well, that's all the memes for April.

46
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:25,060
Some good, some not so good.

47
00:02:25,060 --> 00:02:26,060
Were there any that I missed?

48
00:02:26,060 --> 00:02:26,560
Probably.
