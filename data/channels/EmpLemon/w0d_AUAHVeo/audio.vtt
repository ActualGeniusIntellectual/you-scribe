00:00.000 --> 00:12.000
Legend has it that the Muscogee Indians used to race horses at Dry Valley in what is now

00:12.000 --> 00:14.040
Northern Alabama.

00:14.040 --> 00:18.440
The Natives referred to the region as Tallatige, or border town.

00:18.440 --> 00:23.360
Eventually, as American colonists began to settle the surrounding lands, the border of

00:23.360 --> 00:27.340
the Native American territory gradually began to shrink.

00:27.340 --> 00:34.020
By 1813, Tallatige had become a battleground as the Muscogee erupted in civil war.

00:34.020 --> 00:38.860
The Tallatige Natives remained loyal to the Americans and helped General Andrew Jackson

00:38.860 --> 00:43.460
defeat the Red Sticks, an opposing faction who were fighting to preserve the sovereignty

00:43.460 --> 00:45.660
of the Indian Territory.

00:45.660 --> 00:51.680
In 1830, President Andrew Jackson would repay the favor by ordering the removal of all indigenous

00:51.680 --> 00:54.460
tribes from the Southern United States.

00:54.460 --> 00:59.600
Disgraced by their compatriots and betrayed by their American allies, the Tallatige Indians

00:59.600 --> 01:03.560
abandoned their ancestral lands, never to return.

01:03.560 --> 01:08.980
According to legend, as the tribe gazed over Dry Valley for the final time, the shaman

01:08.980 --> 01:17.940
cursed the land and all of its future intruders to be struck with misfortune.

01:17.940 --> 01:22.800
A hundred thirty years later, the president of NASCAR is looking for a new site to construct

01:22.800 --> 01:25.500
his most ambitious racetrack yet.

01:25.500 --> 01:29.860
After failing to secure a venue in Raleigh or Greenville, Bill France set his sights

01:29.860 --> 01:32.760
on a secluded valley in northern Alabama.

01:32.760 --> 01:38.460
The town of Talladega was chosen as the location of NASCAR's biggest super speedway, where,

01:38.460 --> 01:43.580
rather than horses, men would race two-ton hunks of metal at triple-digit speeds.

01:43.580 --> 01:49.020
Bill France probably never knew about the curse, hardly anyone did, but soon enough,

01:49.020 --> 01:53.160
in one way or another, all of NASCAR would learn to fear Talladega.

02:19.020 --> 02:25.540
The inaugural running of a NASCAR race can be something truly special.

02:25.540 --> 02:31.500
The first Daytona 500 in 1959 immediately cemented the race as NASCAR's most prestigious

02:31.500 --> 02:32.500
event.

02:32.500 --> 02:37.900
NASCAR's first race at Indianapolis in 1994 was such a spectacle that it attracted more

02:37.900 --> 02:41.260
entrants than any other event in the history of the sport.

02:41.260 --> 02:45.820
Talladega's inaugural race was also a spectacle, but not for the right reasons.

02:45.820 --> 02:50.620
Hey, I'm Slabshoes and this is an abridged version of my video on what is widely considered

02:50.620 --> 02:56.780
to be the worst NASCAR race in history, which was the very first race ever held at Talladega.

02:56.780 --> 03:00.640
If you want all the nitty gritty details, the link to the full video is in the description.

03:00.640 --> 03:05.400
To say that Talladega's very first event was controversial would be a massive understatement.

03:05.400 --> 03:09.780
It was unlike any other race ever held in NASCAR history and for all the wrong reasons.

03:09.780 --> 03:13.780
First, the track was completed dangerously close to opening weekend by design.

03:13.780 --> 03:16.940
Bill France had gone into serious debt trying to build this place and he needs his money

03:16.940 --> 03:18.820
back as soon as possible.

03:18.820 --> 03:23.700
In August, just a month before race day, Talladega holds its very first tests, and despite topping

03:23.700 --> 03:28.240
out at 195 miles per hour, the drivers showed concern very early on.

03:28.240 --> 03:32.220
Donny Allison, a multi-time winner in NASCAR's top division, said the track is as rough as

03:32.220 --> 03:33.220
a cob.

03:33.220 --> 03:34.960
It'd be a beautiful track if it were smooth.

03:34.960 --> 03:37.340
The only way they're going to fix it is to repave it.

03:37.340 --> 03:41.220
Meanwhile, Cale Yarbrough noticed that his tires were shredded after just a dozen laps

03:41.220 --> 03:42.220
on the track.

03:42.220 --> 03:44.300
He also noted lots of bumps in the turns.

03:44.300 --> 03:47.780
Not exactly something you want to navigate when you're pushing 200 miles an hour in what

03:47.780 --> 03:50.740
passed for safety equipment back in the 1960s.

03:50.740 --> 03:54.900
NASCAR's two tire manufacturers, Goodyear and Firestone, take note of the tire wear

03:54.900 --> 03:57.660
and vow to come back with harder tires to compensate.

03:57.660 --> 04:02.060
The first open practice for all teams happens in September on the Wednesday just before

04:02.060 --> 04:03.780
the race on Sunday.

04:03.780 --> 04:05.900
And that tire issue is not resolved.

04:06.100 --> 04:09.580
Guys are noticing chunks of rubber coming off the tires after just a few laps.

04:09.580 --> 04:14.300
Goodyear and Firestone fly on harder compounds on Thursday and Friday, but nothing works.

04:14.300 --> 04:18.580
Drivers are getting uppity, and by Friday, Firestone backs out, citing safety concerns.

04:18.580 --> 04:23.140
The drivers, who just mere weeks ago formed the Professional Drivers Association, a union-like

04:23.140 --> 04:26.720
organization, are talking openly of a potential walkout.

04:26.720 --> 04:31.180
And the president of the PDA, Richard Petty, the winningest NASCAR driver in history, is

04:31.180 --> 04:33.580
in some tense negotiations with Bill Franz.

04:33.620 --> 04:37.820
But the straw that broke the camel's back was one exchange between Franz and Bobby Allison,

04:37.820 --> 04:40.260
who won the most recent race just last week.

04:40.260 --> 04:44.020
Franz says to Bobby, quote, I think you're just afraid to race.

04:44.020 --> 04:47.820
Bobby was taken aback, but it was the quiet Leroy Yarbrough who stepped up from behind

04:47.820 --> 04:51.540
him and swung and hit Bill Franz in the face, knocking him to the ground.

04:51.540 --> 04:55.180
Leroy then calmly said to everybody watching, boys, pack up your stuff.

04:55.180 --> 04:56.180
We're leaving.

04:56.180 --> 05:00.500
And just like that, almost every single driver put their cars back on the hauler and left

05:00.500 --> 05:02.740
the track, save for three holdouts.

05:02.900 --> 05:06.900
One, Bobby Isaac, a soft-spoken man who never joined the PDA, just because he didn't like

05:06.900 --> 05:11.380
the idea of anybody speaking on his behalf, two, a non-PDA driver named Jim Vandiver driving

05:11.380 --> 05:16.080
a car owned by Ray Fox, and three, a young up-and-comer named Richard Brickhouse.

05:16.080 --> 05:20.660
Richard made his very first NASCAR top division start ever just last year at Rockingham.

05:20.660 --> 05:24.740
And despite that being his first race on a paved track, he finished fourth.

05:24.740 --> 05:29.020
Brickhouse is a PDA driver and plans to walk, but the Dodge factory team pulls him aside

05:29.020 --> 05:34.380
and offers him a new ride, the brand new Dodge Charger Daytona, a winged supercar supposedly

05:34.380 --> 05:37.220
capable of speeds exceeding 200 miles an hour.

05:37.220 --> 05:38.720
But this weekend, it won't happen.

05:38.720 --> 05:40.220
The tires just can't take it.

05:40.220 --> 05:44.480
Brickhouse agrees to the deal and turns scab, leaving the PDA that afternoon.

05:44.480 --> 05:49.820
So there it is, a 500-mile race at a 2.66-mile track with just three cars in the mix.

05:49.820 --> 05:51.980
Bill Franz offers fans a special deal.

05:51.980 --> 05:55.420
If you buy a ticket for the inaugural race at Talladega, you can use that stub to get

05:55.420 --> 05:57.540
into the Daytona 500 next year.

05:57.540 --> 06:01.140
Were the two-for-one special that good, people turned out in droves to watch the shitshow

06:01.140 --> 06:02.540
down in Alabama.

06:02.540 --> 06:06.820
But Big Bill has one more trick up his sleeve to make the race just a little less ridiculous.

06:06.820 --> 06:11.140
He poaches drivers from the preliminary race on Saturday, the Grand American Series, who

06:11.140 --> 06:14.740
race smaller pony cars on the infield road course, not the big track.

06:14.740 --> 06:19.100
Instead of Chargers, Chevelles, Torino's, and Roadrunners, they race Camaros, Mustangs,

06:19.100 --> 06:21.540
Darts, and even one AMC Javelin.

06:21.540 --> 06:26.500
These cars were never intended to drive on a track this big, and they can barely do 160

06:26.500 --> 06:28.680
miles an hour with the wind at their backs.

06:28.680 --> 06:31.340
Not to mention, there's no way they could pass tech inspection.

06:31.340 --> 06:33.840
These are cars from a completely different series.

06:33.840 --> 06:37.780
So Big Bill Franz calls an audible and just changes the minimum speed requirements and

06:37.780 --> 06:41.420
the inspection templates, all with just a simple wave of the hand.

06:41.420 --> 06:45.420
And just in case any driver is thinking of backing out, he offers cash bonuses just to

06:45.420 --> 06:48.860
roll off the grid on top of the already stated winnings purse.

06:48.860 --> 06:52.820
But with so much tension looming in the air over this slapdash ramshackle affair of a

06:52.820 --> 06:55.920
race, the stage is set for a disaster to occur, and it does.

06:55.920 --> 06:58.240
But not in the way anybody expected.

06:58.240 --> 07:02.840
That tire issue is resolved at the 11th hour, when Goodyear flies in their last Hail Mary,

07:02.840 --> 07:04.760
and those tires finally held up.

07:04.760 --> 07:06.960
There wasn't a single tire failure that day.

07:06.960 --> 07:11.200
No, what did this race in was one of my favorite parts of old NASCAR racing.

07:11.200 --> 07:12.900
The scoring error.

07:12.900 --> 07:16.660
Electronic transponders and timing and scoring didn't exist yet, so officials would move

07:16.660 --> 07:19.820
placards around on a desk to keep track of all the cars.

07:19.820 --> 07:22.340
If the officials agreed on the running order, then it was final.

07:22.340 --> 07:24.320
But every once in a while, they got it wrong.

07:24.400 --> 07:25.960
Well, that happened in this race.

07:25.960 --> 07:30.200
That's right, with only three cars even being competitive, NASCAR still lost track

07:30.200 --> 07:34.780
of Jim Vandiver and Richard Brickhouse, the two guys competing for the lead.

07:34.780 --> 07:38.200
Bobby Isaac was taking it easy just worrying about finishing so he could have some easy

07:38.200 --> 07:41.720
points to make a run at the championship with all of his competition sitting at home.

07:41.720 --> 07:45.320
Richard Brickhouse has declared the winner by NASCAR officials, but Jim Vandiver and

07:45.320 --> 07:48.340
his car owner Ray Fox are adamant that they've won.

07:48.340 --> 07:52.240
And even the radio call with two-time Cup Series champion Ned Jarrett in the booth thought

07:52.240 --> 07:54.180
Jim Vandiver was in the lead.

07:54.180 --> 07:57.720
And I think it's worth noting that Jim was driving the older model of Dodge Charger and

07:57.720 --> 07:59.940
was not affiliated with Chrysler Corp.

07:59.940 --> 08:04.380
Meanwhile, Brickhouse was driving the Dodge Factory entry, and it was the first race ever

08:04.380 --> 08:06.420
for their new winged Wonder Car.

08:06.420 --> 08:10.800
Rumors persist that the scoring error was not an accident, and Chrysler executives sweet-talked

08:10.800 --> 08:13.540
Bill Frantz into manipulating the finish of the race.

08:13.540 --> 08:16.640
After all, they kept some of the intrigue for the event by making a big deal about their

08:16.640 --> 08:17.640
new car.

08:17.640 --> 08:21.540
A lot of people in attendance bought a ticket just because they wanted to see that new Daytona

08:21.540 --> 08:24.380
rip around the track at nearly 200 miles an hour.

08:24.380 --> 08:28.280
Richard Brickhouse's win stands, and he is absolutely elated with his first career

08:28.280 --> 08:32.460
Cup Series win, and is so sure that he'll be tapped to drive the car full-time next

08:32.460 --> 08:36.100
year that he uses his winnings to buy a brand new airplane for himself.

08:36.100 --> 08:40.460
But unfortunately, he never got the call from Chrysler, or any team for that matter.

08:40.460 --> 08:44.660
In a year's time, he was semi-retired and only racing a few times per year.

08:44.660 --> 08:49.020
So there it was, a disaster of a race made up mostly of field fillers, a tire scandal

08:49.020 --> 08:53.060
resolved at the last possible second, a brand new supercar that nobody got to see the full

08:53.060 --> 08:56.660
potential of, and of those two competitive cars out there on the track, they were driven

08:56.660 --> 09:00.780
by two guys nobody had ever heard of, and we're not even sure which one of them actually

09:00.780 --> 09:02.040
won the race.

09:02.040 --> 09:06.820
If this isn't the worst race in NASCAR history, then I really don't know what would be.

09:06.820 --> 09:12.540
So ends the tale of NASCAR's most disastrous inaugural race, and so begins the tale of

09:12.540 --> 09:14.740
the Talladega curse.

09:14.740 --> 09:19.780
Over the next half century, Talladega Superspeedway would play host to some of the strangest,

09:19.780 --> 09:24.880
unexplainable and harrowing occurrences to ever afflict the sport of stock car racing.

09:24.880 --> 09:29.080
The earliest races at the track are possibly the most mysterious.

09:29.080 --> 09:34.180
They existed in a time before NASCAR was frequently televised, and most of the footage from this

09:34.180 --> 09:37.620
era is either missing or not publicly available.

09:37.620 --> 09:42.660
For many incidents during this time, only the stories remain, leaving the rest up to

09:42.660 --> 09:44.500
our imagination.

09:44.500 --> 09:50.120
The Talladega woes would continue in 1973, which may have been the most tumultuous single

09:50.120 --> 09:52.440
year in the history of the track.

09:52.440 --> 09:57.420
That year's Winston 500 earned the dubious distinction as the only race in NASCAR's modern

09:57.420 --> 10:02.740
era to start with a field of 60 cars, a decision that would immediately backfire on the ninth

10:02.740 --> 10:07.260
lap when one car blew an engine and spilled a trail of oil in front of the supersized

10:07.260 --> 10:08.640
field.

10:08.640 --> 10:12.980
Drivers were instantly sent spinning across the infield grass, kicking up a cloud of smoke

10:12.980 --> 10:16.980
and dust that made many wrecked cars impossible to see.

10:16.980 --> 10:22.340
When the dust settled, 23 drivers had piled into the wreckage, and the Talladega backstretch

10:22.340 --> 10:25.300
now resembled the set of a Mad Max film.

10:25.300 --> 10:30.420
Multiple drivers suffered severe injuries, including longtime driver Wendell Scott, who

10:30.420 --> 10:34.700
was so badly wounded that he was practically forced into retirement.

10:34.700 --> 10:38.020
It was an outright miracle that no one died that day.

10:38.020 --> 10:43.380
The following race at Talladega would not be so fortunate.

10:43.380 --> 10:47.060
Just three months later, teams and drivers would have to pick up the pieces and run it

10:47.060 --> 10:49.640
back in the Talladega 500.

10:49.640 --> 10:54.260
On lap 13, defending rookie of the year Larry Smith struck the turn one wall in a single

10:54.260 --> 10:55.860
car incident.

10:55.860 --> 11:00.500
Hours later, fans and crew members were shocked to discover that Smith had tragically become

11:00.500 --> 11:03.220
Talladega's first fatality.

11:03.220 --> 11:08.980
Commentator Ken Squire was perplexed as the accident looked nowhere close to deadly.

11:08.980 --> 11:13.840
Smith's fatality was unbeknownst to competitor Bobby Isaac, who would go on to do something

11:13.840 --> 11:16.900
even more inexplicable later in the day.

11:16.900 --> 11:22.360
Midway through the race, the 1970 Champion would impulsively pull his car into the pits.

11:22.360 --> 11:26.880
It was at that moment, in the middle of the race, that Bobby Isaac decided to retire from

11:26.880 --> 11:28.460
full-time racing.

11:28.460 --> 11:32.920
Media outlets at the time reported that Isaac heard a voice in his head which told him to

11:32.920 --> 11:35.520
stop racing immediately.

11:35.520 --> 11:40.640
After missing the rest of the 1973 season, Isaac would periodically return to the track

11:40.640 --> 11:43.160
for a handful of races per year.

11:43.160 --> 11:49.360
In 1977, the 45-year-old driver collapsed while exiting his race car and would be pronounced

11:49.360 --> 11:52.440
dead the next day from cardiac arrest.

11:52.440 --> 11:57.000
At the time, Isaac held the NASCAR record for the fastest lap at Talladega, which he

11:57.000 --> 11:59.160
set in 1970.

11:59.160 --> 12:04.740
In 1975, racing legend Mark Donahue ran a time trial lap at Talladega with an average

12:04.740 --> 12:10.360
speed of 221 miles per hour, setting a closed-circuit world record.

12:10.360 --> 12:14.960
Days later, Donahue was fatally wounded from a crash while practicing for the Austrian

12:14.960 --> 12:16.360
Grand Prix.

12:16.360 --> 12:21.740
On nearly the same day as Donahue's accident, beloved NASCAR driver Tiny Lund was struck

12:21.740 --> 12:27.360
and killed after another car collided with his driver-side door on the Talladega backstretch.

12:27.360 --> 12:32.600
In less than a decade of operation, Talladega Superspeedway had already been directly or

12:32.600 --> 12:35.840
indirectly linked to the deaths of four drivers.

12:35.840 --> 12:40.740
However, following the death of Tiny Lund, the speedway spirits would look more kindly

12:40.740 --> 12:43.220
on the track's active competitors.

12:43.220 --> 12:50.080
To this day, Tiny Lund remains the last driver to lose his life in a NASCAR race at Talladega.

12:50.080 --> 12:54.680
While drivers would remarkably be spared on the track, there were never any guarantees

12:54.680 --> 12:56.280
inside of it.

12:56.280 --> 13:01.980
During the 1975 Winston 500, Richard Petty's car caught fire in the pits.

13:01.980 --> 13:06.840
As Petty's brother-in-law Randy Owens rushed to douse the flames with a fire hose, the

13:06.840 --> 13:13.680
nearby pressurized water tank exploded, launching Owens 15 feet in the air and killing him instantly.

13:13.680 --> 13:19.780
In 1977, veteran driver David Sisco was competing at Talladega when he was greeted by a terrible

13:19.780 --> 13:21.640
sight in the infield.

13:21.640 --> 13:26.360
His mother had been struck and killed by a pickup truck near the garage area.

13:26.360 --> 13:31.760
Sisco was apparently so devastated that he would never attempt another NASCAR race.

13:31.760 --> 13:36.520
Unbelievably, this wouldn't be the last pickup truck-related death at Talladega.

13:36.520 --> 13:41.800
In 1996, the president of ARCA was T-boned in the parking lot and would later go on to

13:41.800 --> 13:44.120
die from his injuries.

13:44.120 --> 13:49.240
Along with its string of inexplicable tragedy, the early days of Talladega also housed some

13:49.240 --> 13:53.540
of the most bizarre mysteries that stock car racing has ever known.

13:53.540 --> 14:00.060
On the morning of the 1974 Talladega 500, crew members awoke to an unnerving development.

14:00.060 --> 14:04.120
The race cars of nearly a dozen drivers had been sabotaged.

14:04.120 --> 14:08.780
Teams inspected their vehicles and discovered slashed tires cut oil lines and gas tanks

14:08.780 --> 14:10.240
filled with sand.

14:10.240 --> 14:15.020
The extent of the sabotage was only fully realized during the race, as many drivers

14:15.020 --> 14:19.420
began experiencing mechanical failures as soon as they hit the track.

14:19.420 --> 14:25.180
Miraculously, no drivers were injured in the fiasco, but sabotaging so many race cars at

14:25.180 --> 14:29.620
a track as fast as Talladega was practically attempted mass murder.

14:29.620 --> 14:34.380
Authorities launched an immediate investigation to find the perpetrator, but were unable to

14:34.380 --> 14:36.900
identify even a single suspect.

14:36.900 --> 14:42.500
Whoever sabotaged the cars did not leave a trace of evidence, and to this day, the Talladega

14:42.500 --> 14:45.100
Tamperer remains at large.

14:45.100 --> 14:50.260
Following the worst vehicular sabotage in NASCAR history, the track amped up security

14:50.260 --> 14:55.740
for future events, and while they succeeded at keeping future delinquents out of the garage,

14:55.740 --> 14:59.660
they didn't think to check whether one could wind up behind the wheel.

14:59.660 --> 15:05.960
Prior to the 1982 Winston 500, a few drivers expressed confusion at an unfamiliar name

15:05.960 --> 15:08.140
on the entry list for the race.

15:08.180 --> 15:13.860
A man by the name of L.W. Wright had purchased a race car for $20,000, which he entered in

15:13.860 --> 15:16.140
that week's race at Talladega.

15:16.140 --> 15:22.380
Despite claiming to be a seasoned stock car racing veteran, no other driver had ever heard of him.

15:22.380 --> 15:26.880
However, in an age before detailed record keeping, it was somewhat plausible that a

15:26.880 --> 15:31.000
driver could have honed their skills in some middle of nowhere town.

15:31.000 --> 15:35.800
The mysterious driver managed to qualify for the race, despite wrecking his car on just

15:35.800 --> 15:38.200
the second lap around the track.

15:38.200 --> 15:43.060
As the crew was repairing the car for race day, Wright seemed unable to answer basic

15:43.060 --> 15:45.840
questions that any driver should have known.

15:45.840 --> 15:51.400
Suspicion aside, Wright managed to line up for Sunday's race and take the green flag.

15:51.400 --> 15:57.080
Immediately it was clear that the number 34 Chevrolet was dangerously off the pace.

15:57.080 --> 16:02.040
Wright was quickly lapped by the leaders and was ordered by NASCAR to retire from the race.

16:02.040 --> 16:06.920
So L.W. Wright again, giving the black flag as he passes by us, and Wright has been ordered

16:06.920 --> 16:08.400
to the pit area.

16:08.400 --> 16:13.040
After pulling into the pits, Wright got out of his car, slipped into the infield, and

16:13.040 --> 16:14.940
was never seen again.

16:14.940 --> 16:21.120
It turned out that L.W. Wright was an imposter and had conned investors out of nearly $50,000

16:21.120 --> 16:24.720
so that he could race alongside NASCAR's biggest stars.

16:24.720 --> 16:29.100
To this day, the true identity of L.W. Wright remains unknown.

16:29.100 --> 16:33.860
His alias persists as one name in the NASCAR record books that may always be shrouded in

16:33.860 --> 16:35.360
mystery.

16:35.360 --> 16:39.500
After letting what was essentially an average Joe mess around in a sanctioned professional

16:39.500 --> 16:44.600
sporting event, NASCAR would tighten up their standards for who exactly was allowed on the

16:44.600 --> 16:45.600
track.

16:45.600 --> 16:50.380
However, while paying more scrutiny to the drivers in the race cars, there was one other

16:50.380 --> 16:52.420
car they forgot about.

16:52.420 --> 17:08.780
At the 1986 Winston 500, 20-year-old Darren Crowder stole the pace car that had been left

17:08.780 --> 17:10.980
unoccupied on Pitt Road.

17:10.980 --> 17:15.740
He completed a full circuit at over 100 miles per hour before the police set up a blockade

17:15.740 --> 17:17.660
and took him into custody.

17:17.660 --> 17:23.860
During the whole bewildering spectacle, the crowd of 133,000 fans cheered wildly.

17:23.860 --> 17:28.220
Growing up, we're all told to respect the law of the land, but sometimes you just gotta

17:28.220 --> 17:39.660
root for the rebel.

17:39.660 --> 17:44.280
After the Muscogee Indians were forced to vacate their lands, most obeyed the order

17:44.280 --> 17:48.440
and subjected themselves to the infamous Trail of Tears.

17:48.440 --> 17:53.160
Some of the natives, however, refused to go west to the Indian Territory and instead chose

17:53.160 --> 17:55.960
to keep their destiny in their own hands.

17:55.960 --> 18:01.080
A few Muscogee turned their sights instead towards the south, in the mostly uninhabited

18:01.080 --> 18:03.200
territory of Florida.

18:03.200 --> 18:08.260
The subtropical peninsula had become known as a safe haven for refugees of the expanding

18:08.260 --> 18:10.300
American empire.

18:10.300 --> 18:15.060
Together with various other displaced natives and escaped African slaves, the remnants of

18:15.060 --> 18:19.280
the Muscogee would integrate into a new tribe, the Seminole.

18:19.280 --> 18:24.040
Although they too were forced to abandon their way of life like all the others, at the very

18:24.040 --> 18:32.260
least for the time being, they were free.

18:32.260 --> 18:38.960
In 1819, Spain ceded the Florida Territory to the United States and concerns of relocation

18:38.960 --> 18:40.940
immediately returned.

18:40.940 --> 18:46.000
Although the Seminole briefly received a reservation on the peninsula, it wouldn't be long until

18:46.000 --> 18:50.400
the federal government once again demanded they move out west.

18:50.400 --> 18:56.660
After already sacrificing so much, the Seminole refused to budge and after Chief Osceola shot

18:56.660 --> 19:01.660
and killed federal agent Wiley Thompson, they found themselves at war with the might of

19:01.660 --> 19:03.520
the U.S. military.

19:03.520 --> 19:08.380
As the American troops marched into Florida, the Seminole warriors would soon be outnumbered

19:08.380 --> 19:10.640
by as much as 10 to 1.

19:10.640 --> 19:21.440
Needless to say, they were heavy underdogs.

19:21.440 --> 19:26.300
Talladega Super Speedway has always been unusually favorable to underdogs.

19:26.300 --> 19:31.040
The relative ease with which drivers can navigate the track opens the door for the occasional

19:31.040 --> 19:34.140
David to contend with NASCAR's Goliath.

19:34.140 --> 19:39.240
In addition to the fluke win of Richard Brickhouse in the inaugural race, five other drivers

19:39.240 --> 19:44.960
would score their one and only career victory in the first 20 years of competition at Talladega,

19:44.960 --> 19:47.940
by far the most of any track in the sport.

19:47.940 --> 19:52.820
In the early days of the track, winning at Talladega was a matter of endurance.

19:52.820 --> 19:57.620
Completing 500 miles at the longest circuit in the sport was a daunting task for even

19:57.620 --> 20:00.060
the most dominant race teams.

20:00.080 --> 20:04.400
Getting yourself in position to win was often as simple as overcoming the attrition of your

20:04.400 --> 20:05.400
competitors.

20:05.400 --> 20:10.120
Eventually, most teams figured out how to make their machines go the distance, and the

20:10.120 --> 20:15.020
name of the game shifted to speed.

20:15.020 --> 20:20.280
In spite of its many trials and tribulations, Talladega Super Speedway has always managed

20:20.280 --> 20:23.280
to draw in fans for one simple reason.

20:23.280 --> 20:28.240
There's no other place on earth where you can witness so many cars go so fast.

20:28.240 --> 20:33.080
The track's 33-degree corners allow drivers to maintain incredible momentum throughout

20:33.080 --> 20:34.340
the circuit.

20:34.340 --> 20:38.840
Talladega may be the only track in all of racing where you can complete an entire lap

20:38.840 --> 20:41.260
without ever touching the brake pedal.

20:41.260 --> 20:46.180
The colossal oval is capable of producing such extreme speeds that most motorsports

20:46.180 --> 20:48.460
don't feel comfortable racing on it.

20:48.460 --> 20:52.620
In 1980, IndyCar had plans for a Talladega race.

20:52.620 --> 20:57.060
They would soon scrap the idea forever after it became clear that the cars would be moving

20:57.060 --> 21:01.400
so fast that any accident essentially meant certain death.

21:01.400 --> 21:06.840
Stock cars are considerably slower than open-wheel cars, but soon enough, they too would begin

21:06.840 --> 21:09.080
approaching the danger zone.

21:09.080 --> 21:15.140
Bobby Isaac managed to break the 200-mile-per-hour barrier as early as 1970, but rule changes

21:15.140 --> 21:19.840
to the cars brought speeds down to the 180s for most of the decade.

21:19.840 --> 21:25.980
Gradually though, speeds began to creep back up, and in 1982, Benny Parsons would once

21:25.980 --> 21:31.560
again reach 200, becoming the first NASCAR driver to eclipse the mark in a qualifying

21:31.560 --> 21:32.740
lap.

21:32.740 --> 21:38.440
One year later, Cale Yarbrough would reach 202, surpassing Bobby Isaac's 13-year-old

21:38.440 --> 21:39.440
record.

21:39.440 --> 21:45.320
1985 would mark the arrival of the fastest man in NASCAR history, Bill Elliott, who would

21:45.320 --> 21:50.960
qualify for the Winston 500 with a monster lap of 209 miles per hour.

21:50.960 --> 21:55.440
Elliott's car was so much faster than the competition that after a ruptured oil pump

21:55.440 --> 22:00.980
forced him into the pits, Elliott would overcome a five-mile deficit under green to retake

22:00.980 --> 22:03.280
the lead by the end of the race.

22:03.280 --> 22:08.140
Even after burning several minutes on pit road, Elliott had just ran the fastest race

22:08.140 --> 22:14.540
in NASCAR history, completing 500 miles in just over 2 hours and 41 minutes.

22:14.540 --> 22:18.900
Two years later, Bill Elliott would complete a two-and-two-thirds-mile lap at Talladega

22:18.900 --> 22:25.100
in under 45 seconds, setting an average speed of 212.8 miles per hour.

22:25.100 --> 22:29.220
It was at this point that the entire sport of stock car racing would discover that they

22:29.220 --> 22:32.720
had ventured too far into unwelcome territory.

22:32.720 --> 22:38.400
Talladega, it means speed, it means competition, and speed's certainly something we've seen

22:38.400 --> 22:40.160
a lot of this weekend, Larry.

22:40.160 --> 22:44.280
Eight drivers exceeded 210 miles per hour.

22:44.280 --> 22:49.960
The identical front row as last year, Bill Elliott on the pole and Bobby Allison alongside.

22:50.180 --> 22:55.540
Bobby Allison spent a brief period as NASCAR's most popular driver, and at Talladega, the

22:55.540 --> 22:59.580
Alabama-born racing legend was always a fan favorite.

22:59.580 --> 23:05.780
On May 3rd, 1987, Bobby Allison came inches away from becoming one with the fans.

23:05.780 --> 23:11.780
One of the real friends of Bobby Allison is on the tire.

23:11.780 --> 23:15.240
Bobby Allison with a horrible crash here on the front stretch.

23:15.240 --> 23:19.700
It has torn out a complete section of protective railing.

23:20.000 --> 23:25.160
After a mechanical failure sent his car spinning down the tri-oval, Bobby Allison found himself

23:25.160 --> 23:29.200
at the center of the most frightening near-miss in NASCAR history.

23:29.200 --> 23:34.480
The Talladega pace had become so fast that even a slight aberration was enough to transform

23:34.480 --> 23:38.840
any of the 40 vehicles on track into a two-ton projectile.

23:38.840 --> 23:43.400
Just as everyone was starting to forget about the Talladega curse, the track would produce

23:43.400 --> 23:48.980
an incident so ominous that it would fundamentally alter the future of stock car racing.

23:48.980 --> 23:53.720
One may consider it benevolent of the curse to spare everyone on that day, but the story

23:53.720 --> 23:57.520
of Talladega's most dangerous race doesn't end here.

23:57.520 --> 24:02.560
Following Bobby Allison's spine-chilling accident, the fastest field in NASCAR history

24:02.560 --> 24:07.960
would be conquered by the heir to the Allison throne, Davy Allison, who scored his first

24:07.960 --> 24:12.000
career victory on the same day that his father cheated death.

24:12.000 --> 24:15.400
Six years later, fate would repay the favor.

24:15.400 --> 24:18.060
A sad note in sports today.

24:18.060 --> 24:23.300
Stock car racer Davy Allison died this morning after the helicopter he was piloting crashed

24:23.300 --> 24:26.660
yesterday in the infield of the Talladega Speedway down in Alabama.

24:26.660 --> 24:32.460
Davy Allison, a great champion and a good friend of ours, was 32.

24:35.460 --> 24:40.660
Although his life and career were cut tragically short, Davy Allison's legacy will always be

24:40.660 --> 24:47.080
etched in the 1987 Winston 500, possibly the most influential single race in NASCAR

24:47.080 --> 24:48.640
history.

24:48.640 --> 24:53.580
Bill Elliott would become the last NASCAR driver to ever reach the 2.12 mark.

24:53.580 --> 24:58.620
After this race, super speedways entered the age of the restrictor plate, a new component

24:58.620 --> 25:04.420
to the intake manifold designed to limit horsepower and keep speeds under 200 miles per hour.

25:04.420 --> 25:10.240
This thin metal plate would completely change the game and spawn a form of racing so sensationally

25:10.240 --> 25:15.220
unique that no other motorsport in the world even comes close to replicating it.

25:15.220 --> 25:19.480
Plate racing takes traditional racing technique and turns it on its head.

25:19.480 --> 25:24.340
It's a format that can allow the 30th place car to be within two seconds of the leader,

25:24.340 --> 25:27.600
featuring lap after lap of three wide traffic.

25:27.600 --> 25:32.400
Rather than raw driving ability, winning a restrictor plate race relies on the driver's

25:32.400 --> 25:35.060
patience, timing and decision making.

25:35.060 --> 25:40.040
Compared to the spectacular displays of speed in the past, Talladega racing would now resemble

25:40.040 --> 25:43.160
a high velocity game of chess.

25:43.160 --> 25:48.120
Restrictor plates would usher in a new era of NASCAR, and along with it, a new era of

25:48.120 --> 25:49.120
mayhem.

25:49.120 --> 25:52.320
Wow, that's not what you want to see out of your windshield.

25:52.320 --> 25:54.560
Oh my gosh.

25:54.560 --> 25:59.660
While plate racing was intended to make the sport safer, super speedways arguably became

25:59.660 --> 26:02.140
more treacherous than ever before.

26:02.140 --> 26:07.020
The frequency of wrecks skyrocketed as drivers now had far less margin for error in the close

26:07.020 --> 26:08.700
quarters traffic.

26:08.700 --> 26:13.700
With so many opportunities for calamity, the drivers would start discovering inconceivable

26:13.700 --> 26:16.380
methods to wreck a race car.

26:16.380 --> 26:20.700
Talladega had always been a place that pushed the limits of what was possible on a NASCAR

26:20.700 --> 26:25.180
track, and the early 90s saw a remarkable string of accidents where drivers would test

26:25.180 --> 26:27.500
the literal limits of the track.

26:27.500 --> 26:33.420
The 1993 Die Hard 500 was NASCAR's first race at Talladega after the death of Davie

26:33.420 --> 26:34.500
Allison.

26:34.500 --> 26:38.220
The event would be remembered most for two harrowing incidents.

26:38.740 --> 26:43.940
On lap 69, rookie driver Stanley Smith would suffer a head-on collision into the Turn 1

26:43.940 --> 26:44.940
wall.

26:44.940 --> 26:49.060
The accident eerily occurred in the same part of the track as Larry Smith's fatal crash

26:49.060 --> 26:52.340
almost 20 years to the day after the tragedy.

26:52.340 --> 26:56.480
Stanley Smith would manage to survive, but with catastrophic injuries that would end

26:56.480 --> 26:58.380
his racing career entirely.

26:58.380 --> 27:03.560
However, despite involving a driver nearly losing his life, this accident is most well

27:03.560 --> 27:07.360
known for something that had not happened in a NASCAR race in a quarter-century.

27:18.360 --> 27:22.320
Jimmy Horton's No. 32 Chevy had left the racetrack.

27:22.320 --> 27:27.260
The accident compelled NASCAR to install a catch fence in the Talladega corners.

27:27.260 --> 27:32.160
The new enclosure would come in handy just three years later as it prevented Ricky Craven's

27:32.160 --> 27:35.320
car from also exiting the circuit in a similar crash.

27:35.320 --> 27:41.340
However, back in the 1993 Die Hard 500, the mayhem was only half over.

27:41.340 --> 27:46.720
On lap 132, Neil Bonnet's car was sent tumbling into the tri-oval catch fence.

27:46.720 --> 27:52.180
Thankfully, after Bobby Allison's accident, NASCAR had strongly reinforced the line between

27:52.180 --> 27:57.040
the spectators and the action, narrowly escaping yet another tragedy.

27:57.040 --> 28:02.140
While it came very close, this Die Hard 500 did not live up to its moniker.

28:02.140 --> 28:06.400
The event would go on to be remembered as the race where cars seemingly refused to stay

28:06.400 --> 28:08.080
inside the track.

28:08.080 --> 28:13.000
The next time the Cup Series returned to Talladega, Mark Martin would discover the true meaning

28:13.000 --> 28:14.820
of going inside the track.

28:22.820 --> 28:27.360
Once again, NASCAR would have to make some modifications.

28:27.360 --> 28:32.160
Talladega has the strange ability to send cars in seemingly any direction.

28:32.160 --> 28:34.880
In a few cases, that direction would be up.

28:44.000 --> 28:48.840
The blowover is one of the most ethereal moments that any racing fan can witness.

28:48.840 --> 28:54.260
We all know cars as some of the heaviest objects we interact with on a regular basis.

28:54.260 --> 28:58.620
Most of us would have to use all of our strength to get them to budge a single inch.

28:58.620 --> 29:02.800
And to think that something as light as air could be powerful enough to lift a two-ton

29:02.800 --> 29:07.780
machine off the earth, well, you just have to see it to believe it.

29:07.780 --> 29:13.340
At the speeds NASCAR drivers travel at Talladega, it happens more often than you'd guess.

29:13.340 --> 29:17.900
Well, Darrell, a 737, of course, is designed to take off, but it will take off at, what,

29:17.900 --> 29:19.980
160-some miles an hour.

29:19.980 --> 29:24.220
These cars are running 185, and the roof laps do their job to keep that car from getting

29:24.220 --> 29:26.940
way up in the air.

29:26.940 --> 29:28.940
Wow.

29:28.940 --> 29:31.940
Man.

29:31.940 --> 29:37.340
In 1996, the Talladega curse finally caught up to Bill Elliott, who suffered a broken

29:37.340 --> 29:41.100
leg after his car soared across the backstretched grass.

29:41.100 --> 29:45.940
But the most spectacular blowover in Talladega history belongs to a different Elliott.

29:45.940 --> 29:46.940
Uh-oh!

29:46.940 --> 29:47.940
Oh, trouble!

29:47.940 --> 29:52.420
Elliott's shot over once and a half and on his roof!

29:52.420 --> 29:58.460
In 2003, Elliott Sadler would get over a full second of airtime as his car executed a near

29:58.460 --> 30:00.320
flawless pirouette.

30:00.320 --> 30:04.740
The number 38 M&M's Ford must have covered the length of a football field without touching

30:04.740 --> 30:06.080
the ground.

30:06.080 --> 30:11.220
The following season, Sadler returned to Talladega and inexplicably became the only driver in

30:11.220 --> 30:16.340
history to blow over at the same track two years in a row, this time finishing the race

30:16.340 --> 30:17.340
in style.

30:17.340 --> 30:20.900
He said he wanted to finish this race with all four tires on the ground.

30:20.900 --> 30:21.900
He did.

30:21.900 --> 30:29.900
But he just didn't keep them there the whole time.

30:29.900 --> 30:35.140
It's one thing to watch a blowover as a spectator, but to experience one from inside a racecar

30:35.140 --> 30:38.380
is a sensation most of us can only imagine.

30:38.380 --> 30:45.020
A NASCAR engine can roar as loud as 140 decibels, but in an airborne car, many drivers report

30:45.020 --> 30:48.280
a brief moment when everything falls silent.

30:48.280 --> 30:52.240
At the instant in which the mighty racing machine is briefly wrestled away from the

30:52.240 --> 30:57.600
dominion of gravity, it's as if the driver has entered the window to another realm.

30:57.600 --> 31:01.840
Do you think that if they listened hard enough, they would hear the faint thumping of horses

31:01.840 --> 31:04.760
galloping on the Alabama clay?

31:04.760 --> 31:15.160
Of course, in moments like these, most drivers have other things to worry about.

31:15.160 --> 31:20.760
Ever since Bobby Allison's accident, NASCAR has been continually trying to eliminate the

31:20.760 --> 31:21.760
blowover.

31:21.760 --> 31:35.740
But try as they might, Talladega has always found a way to send cars flying.

31:35.740 --> 31:41.220
While more blowovers happen at Talladega than anywhere else, the track's most iconic accidents

31:41.220 --> 31:43.580
are of a far different breed.

31:43.580 --> 31:48.160
Ever since restrictor plates introduced the age of pack racing, there's been a monster

31:48.160 --> 31:51.160
lurking in every super speedway race.

31:51.160 --> 32:10.120
It's the reason why most drivers, teams, and owners dread Talladega Sunday.

32:10.120 --> 32:14.940
They call it the big one, a massive pileup that can wipe out more than a dozen cars in

32:14.940 --> 32:16.420
the blink of an eye.

32:16.420 --> 32:22.180
Talladega may have the most room of any NASCAR track, but when the big one strikes, drivers

32:22.180 --> 32:25.420
often find themselves with nowhere to go.

32:25.420 --> 32:28.180
It can happen anywhere at any time.

32:28.180 --> 32:31.980
All it takes is for one driver to make one mistake.

32:31.980 --> 32:36.840
It's as simple as someone mistiming a block, sticking their nose in a gap too small, or

32:36.840 --> 32:40.300
inexplicably rejoining the pack at half speed.

32:40.300 --> 32:43.760
Whatever the cause, the outcome remains the same.

32:43.760 --> 32:47.820
Multiple drivers' days are ended by something they had no way of preventing.

32:47.820 --> 32:51.780
Modern day NASCAR fields race with around 40 cars.

32:51.780 --> 32:56.700
Throughout the 90s, it was not uncommon for the big one to involve 10 or more cars, about

32:56.700 --> 32:58.460
a quarter of the field.

32:58.460 --> 33:02.940
By the 2000s, the accidents started to become truly enormous.

33:02.940 --> 33:09.320
The 2002, 2003, and 2005 Talladega spring races each saw a pileup involving more than

33:09.320 --> 33:15.440
20 drivers, with the 03 race consuming a Cup Series record 27 cars.

33:15.440 --> 33:20.520
However, the largest wreck in modern NASCAR history would happen at a Talladega race in

33:20.520 --> 33:23.500
what is now the NASCAR Xfinity Series.

33:23.500 --> 33:30.060
The division is essentially NASCAR's minor league, and in the 2002 errands 312, inexperience

33:30.060 --> 33:33.400
would contribute to the mother of all pileups.

33:33.400 --> 33:38.640
On lap 14, Johnny Sodders' blue Chevy slid sideways and started tumbling in front of

33:38.640 --> 33:40.580
the entire field.

33:40.580 --> 33:45.640
Drivers began swerving into each other to avoid the carnage and quickly block the track.

33:45.640 --> 33:51.280
When it was all said and done, 31 cars were collected, nearly three quarters of the entire

33:51.280 --> 33:52.680
field.

33:52.680 --> 33:57.640
Out of the few survivors, most would fall off the pace with mechanical issues.

33:57.640 --> 34:03.100
The race eventually boiled down to just two competitive cars, a scenario that may never

34:03.100 --> 34:06.000
occur in another NASCAR race.

34:06.000 --> 34:10.960
While Talladega races have increasingly turned into wreck fests, it's curious to consider

34:10.960 --> 34:17.340
that when it so desires, NASCAR's most feared track is capable of leaving everyone unscathed.

34:17.340 --> 34:24.300
The 1997 Winston 500 was the first race in Talladega history to run caution-free.

34:24.300 --> 34:28.620
After crashing into the infield just three years prior, Mark Martin would break Bill

34:28.620 --> 34:35.820
Elliott's record for the fastest NASCAR race, completing 500 miles in 2 hours and 39 minutes.

34:35.820 --> 34:41.420
In the following five seasons, two more Talladega races would run caution-free.

34:41.420 --> 34:46.180
As of now, it's the last track in NASCAR history to ever achieve this feat.

34:46.180 --> 34:50.980
It really makes you wonder, does Talladega create the mayhem, or do we?

34:50.980 --> 34:55.620
We saw a lot of communication on that restart, that first initial start, with the Stewart-Haas

34:55.620 --> 34:58.900
teams all working together to get in line on the front.

34:58.900 --> 34:59.900
You see them.

34:59.900 --> 35:01.340
They're pulling away, Jeff.

35:01.340 --> 35:07.220
Let's show you how far this first group of Stewart-Haas racing has driven away.

35:07.220 --> 35:12.580
When everyone chooses to cooperate, we are capable of achieving remarkable things.

35:12.580 --> 35:16.340
In an ideal world, we could do anything caution-free.

35:16.340 --> 35:20.260
But there's a reason why idealism is so hopelessly fragile.

35:20.260 --> 35:25.340
While it takes everyone to avoid destruction, it only takes one to create it.

35:25.340 --> 35:31.160
As is the case with most things in America, the best you can do is survive.

35:31.160 --> 35:34.940
What you got ain't nothing new.

35:34.940 --> 35:37.180
This country's hard on people.

35:37.180 --> 35:43.440
You can't stop what's coming.

35:43.440 --> 35:48.300
How is it that when we find ourselves in the biggest place we've ever known, we still run

35:48.300 --> 35:50.220
out of room?

35:50.220 --> 35:55.420
Humans have always been infatuated with the concept of Manifest Destiny, the 19th century

35:55.420 --> 36:00.640
ideal that the United States should inevitably span from sea to shining sea.

36:00.640 --> 36:05.800
This grand vision of America was eventually realized at tremendous expense to those who

36:05.800 --> 36:08.600
originally roamed those lands.

36:08.600 --> 36:14.200
Even now, as we sit atop our New York skyscrapers and California mansions, Manifest Destiny

36:14.200 --> 36:16.580
is still very much alive.

36:16.580 --> 36:21.340
We apply it to what we wear, what we drive, how we conduct business.

36:21.340 --> 36:22.820
Enough is never enough.

36:22.820 --> 36:27.220
We are always marching forward to some glorious, indeterminate outcome.

36:27.220 --> 36:32.100
Why stop at building the biggest racetrack in the world when you can build one even bigger,

36:32.100 --> 36:34.580
steeper, wider, and faster?

36:34.580 --> 36:37.380
Our conquest for more never ends.

36:37.380 --> 36:38.900
Some call it greed.

36:38.900 --> 36:42.980
Others call it destiny.

36:42.980 --> 36:48.220
The driver's strike at Talladega's inaugural contest gave many others a unique opportunity

36:48.220 --> 36:50.500
to race in the Cup Series.

36:50.500 --> 36:55.700
One of those newcomers was a 23-year-old Richard Childress, who would use the prize money from

36:55.700 --> 36:58.900
his big break to open up his own racing team.

36:58.900 --> 37:04.220
In 1981, Childress retired from racing and handed over the reins of his number three

37:04.220 --> 37:10.340
car to NASCAR's newest champion, a driver by the name of Dale Earnhardt.

37:10.340 --> 37:15.980
With Richard Childress racing, Earnhardt would go on to win six of his seven cup championships,

37:15.980 --> 37:21.540
and the Childress number three would become the most iconic stock car of the 20th century.

37:21.540 --> 37:26.540
Earnhardt's career will always be most intertwined with Daytona, but one of his most impressive

37:26.540 --> 37:30.820
feats was coming the closest of anyone to conquering Talladega.

37:30.820 --> 37:36.260
Despite hating restrictor plate racing more so than any other driver, Earnhardt was undeniably

37:36.260 --> 37:37.620
the best at it.

37:37.620 --> 37:42.440
He was so skilled at drafting that some competitors swore that he could literally see the air

37:42.440 --> 37:44.180
coming off the cars.

37:44.180 --> 37:49.560
In October 2000, Talladega would be the site of his final career victory.

37:49.560 --> 37:55.020
In possibly the most impressive display of racing mastery the sport had ever seen, Earnhardt

37:55.020 --> 38:00.920
would charge from 17th to 1st in the final laps to become a 10-time Talladega winner,

38:00.920 --> 38:03.380
by far the most of any driver.

38:03.380 --> 38:08.180
He may have won even more, but, well, you know what tends to happen when someone comes

38:08.180 --> 38:11.060
close to conquering Talladega.

38:11.060 --> 38:16.540
This is undoubtedly one of the toughest announcements that I've ever personally had to make, but

38:16.540 --> 38:22.060
after the accident in turn four at the end of the Daytona 500, we've lost Dale Earnhardt.

38:25.060 --> 38:27.060
The white flag is up.

38:27.060 --> 38:29.060
Final lap at Talladega.

38:29.060 --> 38:30.060
Who's it going to be?

38:30.060 --> 38:33.740
Somebody, Earnhardt Jr., Stewart, or maybe somebody out of the pack.

38:33.740 --> 38:36.980
Look at this move by Jr. at the white flag.

38:36.980 --> 38:42.500
After suffering such terrible loss, the Talladega spirits would shine favorably on Dale Earnhardt

38:42.500 --> 38:46.780
Jr., who would immediately carry on his father's legacy.

38:46.780 --> 38:53.180
One year after Dale Sr.'s final victory, Dale Jr. would score his first Talladega victory.

38:53.180 --> 38:58.700
One of four wins in a row at the track for the new Pied Piper of Super Speedway Racing.

38:58.820 --> 39:03.580
Dale Jr.'s remarkable success on NASCAR's biggest stage would make him an instant fan

39:03.580 --> 39:04.800
favorite.

39:04.800 --> 39:10.060
The newest racing superstar would carry both Talladega and the sport into its present-day

39:10.060 --> 39:11.060
incarnation.

39:11.060 --> 39:12.060
Hey, Ricky Bobby.

39:12.060 --> 39:13.060
Good to see you again.

39:13.060 --> 39:14.060
Thanks, man.

39:14.060 --> 39:15.060
You still owe me that 30 bucks.

39:15.060 --> 39:16.060
Oh, no, man.

39:16.060 --> 39:17.060
You said that was a gift.

39:17.060 --> 39:19.940
You're a dirty liar.

39:19.940 --> 39:24.820
By now, Talladega had become so infamous in pop culture that someone was bound to make

39:24.820 --> 39:26.580
a movie about it.

39:26.580 --> 39:32.660
2006 saw the release of the Will Ferrell comedy Talladega Nights, a film that features a winless

39:32.660 --> 39:36.860
driver growing resentful of his more successful teammate.

39:36.860 --> 39:42.700
Strangely enough, in NASCAR's first race at Talladega after the film's release, a near-identical

39:42.700 --> 39:45.660
storyline would play out in reality.

39:45.660 --> 39:51.600
Back in the 2006 Daytona 500, Brian Vickers is leading with just 15 laps to go and has

39:51.600 --> 39:56.020
a chance to score his first career victory in the biggest race of the year.

39:56.020 --> 40:02.020
Unfortunately for Brian, his teammate Jimmy Johnson passes him and goes on to win instead.

40:02.020 --> 40:07.220
Two months later at the spring Talladega race, Vickers once again has an opportunity to get

40:07.220 --> 40:08.220
his first win.

40:08.220 --> 40:13.300
Now, will Vickers be the good soldier and follow Jeff Gordon home, or does he want his

40:13.300 --> 40:14.300
first win that bad?

40:14.300 --> 40:16.980
He's got to get his first win.

40:16.980 --> 40:23.260
He takes the lead with just two laps to go, only to get passed once again by Jimmy Johnson.

40:23.260 --> 40:27.500
Later in the year, the Hendrick teammates return to Talladega to find themselves nose

40:27.500 --> 40:31.020
to tail behind Dale Jr. in the closing laps.

40:31.020 --> 40:35.440
Both Johnson and Jr. are in a tight championship battle, and it's up to Vickers to help his

40:35.440 --> 40:38.200
teammate complete the pass for the win.

40:38.200 --> 40:50.700
What happened next wasn't exactly a shake and bake.

40:50.700 --> 40:54.380
Talladega has always been known for its sensational finishes.

40:54.380 --> 40:59.980
Since 1980, about a third of all Talladega races have ended in a last lap pass.

40:59.980 --> 41:05.140
Such a scenario is portrayed to great effect in Talladega Nights, which makes use of the

41:05.140 --> 41:07.180
track's most distinct feature.

41:07.180 --> 41:11.860
While most tracks are designed with the finish line in the center of the front straightaway,

41:11.860 --> 41:15.980
Talladega's is about a thousand feet farther down the track towards the entrance of turn

41:15.980 --> 41:16.980
one.

41:16.980 --> 41:21.220
While these seem like a small alteration, this unique design aspect has affected the

41:21.220 --> 41:23.600
outcomes of countless races.

41:23.600 --> 41:29.020
It's amazing what can happen if you leave someone with just a little more room to run.

41:29.020 --> 41:34.380
The name Seminole can be traced back to the Spanish word Cimarron, or runaway.

41:34.380 --> 41:40.100
They were a tribe composed of wildly different people who all shared a single unifying vision,

41:40.100 --> 41:42.540
a refusal to be conquered.

41:42.540 --> 41:45.160
The Seminole warriors fought valiantly.

41:45.160 --> 41:50.180
They pushed the US military to the most challenging and expensive conflict with any indigenous

41:50.180 --> 41:52.560
group in the nation's history.

41:52.560 --> 41:58.760
However, eventually, the Seminole losses had become catastrophic, and they simply couldn't

41:58.760 --> 42:02.800
outlast the overwhelming resources of the United States.

42:02.800 --> 42:07.280
One by one, the Seminole chiefs were captured and forced to surrender.

42:07.280 --> 42:13.800
By 1843, nearly the entire Seminole tribe were forcibly relocated to the Creek Reservation

42:13.800 --> 42:15.520
in Oklahoma.

42:15.520 --> 42:21.000
Only a small fraction managed to evade government capture by fleeing into the Everglades, a

42:21.000 --> 42:26.940
vast stretch of swampy wilderness considered by American settlers to be inhospitable.

42:26.940 --> 42:31.840
After nearly a decade of costly fighting, the military decided that further pursuit

42:31.840 --> 42:34.320
was no longer worth the trouble.

42:34.320 --> 42:41.640
By the end of the war, as few as 100 Seminoles remained, the last of the runaways.

42:41.640 --> 42:46.180
Throughout the rest of the 19th century, all of the other indigenous people in America

42:46.180 --> 42:49.160
would be forced to submit to government rule.

42:49.160 --> 42:55.760
Eventually, the Everglades Seminoles would remain as the last free tribe within US territory.

42:55.760 --> 43:01.580
Despite all of their power and might, America could never conquer the Seminole people.

43:01.580 --> 43:05.160
There are some things in this world that you simply cannot control.

43:12.000 --> 43:17.400
Since its very first race, NASCAR has always struggled to control Talladega.

43:17.400 --> 43:22.860
The track has served as the ultimate fulcrum for the sport's greatest conflict of interest.

43:22.860 --> 43:27.880
By creating the world's most spectacular track, they simultaneously created the world's

43:27.880 --> 43:29.920
most dangerous track.

43:29.920 --> 43:35.040
NASCAR has always straddled the fine line between entertainment and safety.

43:35.040 --> 43:39.480
Throughout the history of the track, the sanctioning body has been in a constant balancing act

43:39.520 --> 43:45.280
in trying to prevent the next Talladega catastrophe while maintaining the track's unique appeal.

43:45.280 --> 43:50.320
The continual addition of rules and regulations has resulted in a style of racing that looks

43:50.320 --> 43:53.920
completely unrecognizable to the sport's humble beginnings.

43:53.920 --> 43:58.560
And, I mean, guys were slamming into one another, they're hitting each other in the corner.

43:58.560 --> 44:01.480
Eventually, just what happened is going to happen.

44:01.480 --> 44:04.280
It's going to happen again, too, probably before the day's over.

44:04.280 --> 44:09.680
Many drivers today feel that Talladega racing is a glorified crapshoot, which is somewhat

44:09.680 --> 44:12.080
emblematic of modern NASCAR as a whole.

44:12.080 --> 44:15.160
You know, look, these championships aren't like winning like Petty and Earnhardt used

44:15.160 --> 44:16.160
to win them.

44:16.160 --> 44:19.680
And, you know, it comes down to one race, and it came down to one race for us tonight

44:19.680 --> 44:21.640
and came up short.

44:21.640 --> 44:26.960
How far are we willing to compromise the merit of competition to manufacture a more entertaining

44:26.960 --> 44:29.160
spectator product?

44:29.160 --> 44:33.480
NASCAR is always trying to tweak the sport to make races more exciting.

44:33.480 --> 44:38.040
But there comes a point where all the micromanagement becomes counterproductive.

44:38.040 --> 44:43.600
It's just, it's idiotic to be out here doing this anyway, trying to put on some cute show

44:43.600 --> 44:45.600
for whatever the hell this is.

44:45.600 --> 44:46.600
It's stupid.

44:46.600 --> 44:48.240
There's no sense in doing this.

44:48.240 --> 44:54.200
One of the most defining aspects of present-day Talladega has been the looming threat of controversy,

44:54.200 --> 44:59.080
where NASCAR's contrived bureaucracy ends up spoiling the race itself.

44:59.080 --> 45:05.120
In 2003, NASCAR would end its policy of allowing drivers to race back to the caution flag,

45:05.120 --> 45:07.880
as the practice was becoming too dangerous.

45:07.880 --> 45:12.520
Instead, the field would be frozen at the moment of caution, a change that would reach

45:12.520 --> 45:15.720
a breaking point the next spring at Talladega.

45:15.720 --> 45:20.800
When the caution came out with five laps to go, fans were thrilled as Dale Jr. appeared

45:20.800 --> 45:22.920
to make the pass for the lead.

45:22.920 --> 45:28.380
However, the lead was instead awarded to Jeff Gordon, as he was slightly ahead at the exact

45:28.380 --> 45:30.060
moment of caution.

45:30.060 --> 45:35.820
The race would not be restarted as Gordon would coast to a very unpopular win, as frustrated

45:35.820 --> 45:38.700
fans pelted the track with debris.

45:38.700 --> 45:43.580
NASCAR would later institute the Green White Checker rule to minimize the chances of races

45:43.580 --> 45:49.060
ending under caution, a policy that has since undergone numerous confusing and inconsistent

45:49.060 --> 45:51.260
changes over the years.

45:51.260 --> 45:56.740
One of the most baffling officiating decisions for any NASCAR finish happened at the 2016

45:56.740 --> 45:59.500
Xfinity Series race at Talladega.

45:59.500 --> 46:04.520
At first, it looked to be an amazing feel-good story with underdog driver Brennan Poole threading

46:04.520 --> 46:07.340
the needle to score his first NASCAR win.

46:07.340 --> 46:12.860
However, in an unprecedented reversal, NASCAR would award the victory instead to Elliott

46:12.860 --> 46:14.020
Sadler.

46:14.020 --> 46:18.460
The officials had bizarrely frozen the field less than a thousand feet from the finish

46:18.460 --> 46:23.940
line, and in that instant, Sadler's car was briefly in the lead, despite being in the

46:23.940 --> 46:26.100
process of crashing.

46:26.100 --> 46:30.560
To this day, Brennan Poole is still searching for his first win.

46:30.560 --> 46:36.240
And by that much, Elliott Sadler, a winner over Brennan Poole at Talladega.

46:36.240 --> 46:40.660
Not even NASCAR's biggest stars can avoid the jinx of Talladega controversy.

46:40.660 --> 46:46.160
Dale Earnhardt Jr. looking for his fifth win at Talladega.

46:46.160 --> 46:51.140
Later in the 2004 season, Dale Jr. would avenge his dubious runner-up finish by winning the

46:51.140 --> 46:57.140
fall Talladega race, only to once again wind up at odds with the sanctioning body.

46:57.140 --> 47:09.180
In his Victory Lane interview, Jr. would drop an expletive on live TV.

47:09.180 --> 47:13.540
A mistake that would normally be a non-issue, but it just so happened that this was the

47:13.540 --> 47:18.540
year of Janet Jackson's wardrobe malfunction at the Super Bowl, and networks at the time

47:18.540 --> 47:22.740
were hyper-vigilant at maintaining their standards and practices.

47:22.740 --> 47:27.980
As a result, Jr. would be docked 25 driver points, which knocked him out of the championship

47:27.980 --> 47:28.980
lead.

47:28.980 --> 47:34.340
2004 was the best season of Jr.'s career, and he may very well have won the title if

47:34.340 --> 47:37.860
all of us weren't so sensitive over a four-letter word.

47:37.860 --> 47:47.380
2004 also marked the beginning of NASCAR's chase for the cup, which eventually morphed

47:47.380 --> 47:51.540
into what we now know as the controversial NASCAR playoffs.

47:51.540 --> 47:57.780
The 2014-16 incarnation of the playoffs was very likely the most busted and unfair championship

47:57.780 --> 48:00.480
format in the history of motorsports.

48:00.480 --> 48:06.540
In October 2015, the system would be painfully exposed at where else but Talladega.

48:06.540 --> 48:11.340
This era decided to make Talladega a cutoff race for the next round, meaning that some

48:11.340 --> 48:16.180
drivers would be forced to do whatever they could to avoid elimination.

48:16.180 --> 48:20.540
On the final restart, Kevin Harvick has a serious mechanical issue.

48:20.540 --> 48:25.460
He can barely keep up at pace car speed and is practically guaranteed to get eliminated

48:25.460 --> 48:27.420
unless he does something dire.

48:27.420 --> 48:33.340
So, with no other conceivable way to save his season, Harvick swerves into the car beside

48:33.340 --> 48:35.980
him and causes a 10-car pileup.

48:35.980 --> 48:40.740
The caution comes out, Harvick coasts to the finish line and advances to the next round

48:40.740 --> 49:00.460
winning quite possibly the worst NASCAR finish in the past decade.

49:00.460 --> 49:05.580
Modern day NASCAR is always throwing curveballs and drivers will adapt to do whatever gets

49:05.580 --> 49:07.460
them closer to winning.

49:07.460 --> 49:12.860
One of the most peculiar changes in super speedway strategy was the brief rise of tandem

49:12.860 --> 49:13.860
drafting.

49:13.860 --> 49:19.020
Following the release of NASCAR's Car of Tomorrow, drivers began to realize that the flat nose

49:19.020 --> 49:24.260
design allowed the cars to lock bumpers at tracks like Talladega and gain an extra boost

49:24.260 --> 49:25.620
in speed.

49:25.620 --> 49:32.380
The tandem era would truly begin at the 2010 errands 499, a race that saw a record 88 lead

49:32.380 --> 49:33.780
changes.

49:33.780 --> 49:39.260
By the next season, drivers had mastered the tandem, leading to one of the most unbelievable

49:39.260 --> 49:49.300
finishes of all time.

49:49.300 --> 49:54.260
In a mad dash to the finish line with eight cars under a blanket, Jimmy Johnson would

49:54.260 --> 50:00.140
edge out the win by two one-thousandths of a second, tied for the closest finish in NASCAR

50:00.140 --> 50:01.140
history.

50:01.140 --> 50:06.980
However, during its brief stint, tandem drafting represented too extreme of a departure from

50:06.980 --> 50:13.100
what audiences were used to and NASCAR would eliminate the strategy in the following season.

50:13.100 --> 50:18.540
While tandem drafting was relatively unpopular in its time, many fans today look back on

50:18.540 --> 50:20.200
the era fondly.

50:20.200 --> 50:25.220
What has never been viewed fondly is the single most despised policy that NASCAR has ever

50:25.220 --> 50:27.540
implemented, the yellow line rule.

50:27.540 --> 50:43.300
The

50:43.300 --> 50:48.820
death of Dale Earnhardt convinced NASCAR to implement a variety of new safety measures.

50:48.820 --> 50:54.100
Most of these ended up being extremely beneficial, but one change, the yellow line rule, has

50:54.100 --> 50:57.540
plagued super speedway races ever since.

50:57.540 --> 51:02.960
In an attempt to reduce the number of accidents, NASCAR started penalizing drivers for passing

51:02.960 --> 51:07.380
on the apron of the straightaways, which they now marked as out of bounds with a double

51:07.380 --> 51:08.900
yellow line.

51:08.900 --> 51:14.080
Despite their good intentions, this change was a prime example of NASCAR trying to outsmart

51:14.080 --> 51:19.460
the room by adding a needlessly complicated judgment call to what was a self-policing

51:19.460 --> 51:33.260
issue.

51:33.260 --> 51:38.460
In 2003, Dale Jr. was not penalized on this pass for the win.

51:38.460 --> 51:42.820
Five years later, Regan Smith would not be so fortunate after he was forced below the

51:42.820 --> 52:06.420
line while passing Tony Stewart for the win.

52:06.420 --> 52:12.080
Even as recently as last year, NASCAR still has seemingly no idea how to actually enforce

52:12.080 --> 52:13.180
the rule.

52:13.180 --> 52:22.480
As Denny Hamlin went way below the line on this pass for the win and wasn't penalized.

52:22.480 --> 52:27.240
Since its inception, countless great moments have been tainted by the perpetual asterisk

52:27.240 --> 52:29.680
which the yellow line rule creates.

52:29.680 --> 52:34.040
And the worst part is there's no evidence to suggest that the rule has had any effect

52:34.040 --> 52:37.200
on its intended purpose of preventing accidents.

52:37.200 --> 52:41.560
If anything, the rule has contributed to an increase in accidents as it effectively

52:41.560 --> 52:58.360
constricts more cars within a narrower space.

52:58.360 --> 53:03.560
Recent races at Talladega have been about as close as you can get to a demolition derby.

53:03.560 --> 53:08.400
It's not uncommon these days for a race to end with less than a dozen cars limping across

53:08.400 --> 53:10.240
the finish line.

53:10.240 --> 53:15.760
Over the past two decades, NASCAR has made incredible strides in safety, an unintended

53:15.760 --> 53:21.960
consequence of which was ushering in a new generation of drivers who no longer fear accidents.

53:21.960 --> 53:26.700
Back in the day, drivers were forced to use restraint on the track because the consequence

53:26.700 --> 53:31.640
of wrecking would be potentially inflicting serious injury on yourself or others.

53:31.640 --> 53:37.080
Today, drivers are mostly free to take unthinkable risks on track and walk away from any mayhem

53:37.080 --> 53:39.120
completely unharmed.

53:39.120 --> 53:43.920
Twice a year now, drivers start a race at Talladega knowing that they most likely won't

53:43.920 --> 53:45.120
make it to the finish.

53:45.120 --> 53:47.120
Sorry, we couldn't crash more cars today.

53:47.120 --> 53:50.080
We didn't fill the quota for today for Talladega and NASCAR.

53:50.080 --> 53:54.040
If we haven't crashed at least 50% of the field by the end of the race, we need to extend

53:54.040 --> 53:57.560
the race till we at least crash 50% of the cars.

53:57.560 --> 54:01.760
This is Talladega, and this is the Talladega Curse.

54:01.760 --> 54:06.320
All the way back in 1969, we didn't just construct a racetrack.

54:06.320 --> 54:09.520
We constructed a monument to mankind's arrogance.

54:09.520 --> 54:14.740
We created something that we can never truly conquer, so that we can spend eternity chasing

54:14.740 --> 54:17.140
our endless desire for more.

54:17.140 --> 54:22.520
No matter how fast we follow them, all roads at Talladega eventually lead to destruction,

54:22.520 --> 54:24.940
misfortune and controversy.

54:24.940 --> 54:29.240
The state of Alabama carries with it a hauntingly somber past.

54:29.240 --> 54:33.920
It has been the epicenter of some of the most unforgivable sins that we as a nation have

54:33.920 --> 54:34.920
ever committed.

54:34.920 --> 54:39.440
A history that's stained as red as the clay on which it all lies.

54:39.440 --> 54:43.780
And unlike clay, the mistakes of our past will never wash out.

54:43.780 --> 54:49.600
They follow us as painful echoes from a faraway time that's somehow still too close to us.

54:49.600 --> 54:54.880
We can never unhear them, but maybe if we get enough race cars together in one place,

54:54.880 --> 54:56.560
we can drown them out.

54:56.560 --> 55:00.380
Even if it's just for a few hours at a time.

55:00.380 --> 55:07.140
The writer, the southern writer, William Faulkner once put it, between grief and nothing, I

55:07.140 --> 55:13.380
will take grief.

55:13.380 --> 55:16.300
People always ask me why I watch NASCAR.

55:16.300 --> 55:20.200
Why I enjoy something riddled with so many imperfections.

55:20.200 --> 55:24.820
And to that, I simply answer that we can design the perfect race car, but we can never

55:24.820 --> 55:27.460
design the perfect driver.

55:27.460 --> 55:32.340
Talladega may not be the greatest display of racing, but it is the greatest display

55:32.340 --> 55:33.340
of humanity.

55:33.340 --> 55:38.060
It's a racetrack where speed, skill and machinery no longer matter.

55:38.060 --> 55:43.060
It's a venue that only seems to grow more prosperous through its legacy of disaster.

55:43.060 --> 55:47.960
It's a battleground where the mistakes of the few are destined to end the journeys of

55:47.960 --> 55:49.060
the many.

55:49.060 --> 56:12.200
The only place in all of racing that produces no winners, only survivors.

56:12.200 --> 56:17.260
Every year on NASCAR's schedule, there are two dates that I never forget to tune in.

56:17.400 --> 56:22.440
When America's greatest drivers are confronted with the one track they fear most.

56:22.440 --> 56:28.320
In the land that America's native people once called home, 40 race cars are cursed to reenact

56:28.320 --> 56:29.320
their story.

56:29.320 --> 56:32.840
That must be at least 30 cars in that wreck.

56:32.840 --> 56:38.020
God help all of them because there's no place to go.

56:38.020 --> 56:42.960
The Seminole bided their time in the Everglades for more than 100 years.

56:42.960 --> 56:48.360
They emerged in an America that had grown rich off the lands they had claimed long ago.

56:48.360 --> 56:53.400
An America that was now looking to move on from its centuries long conquest.

56:53.400 --> 56:59.540
In 1957, the Seminole tribe was granted federal recognition by the US government, extending

56:59.540 --> 57:03.240
them special privileges as a sovereign jurisdiction.

57:03.240 --> 57:08.400
By the 1970s, the Seminole had begun using these privileges to host high stakes bingo

57:08.400 --> 57:13.280
halls which would go on to be the very first Indian casinos.

57:13.280 --> 57:18.680
While most of the Seminole tribe gradually integrated into modern society, a small part

57:18.680 --> 57:22.760
would continue their traditional way of life in the Everglades.

57:22.760 --> 57:27.320
This group would go on to form a new tribe known as the Miccosukee.

57:27.320 --> 57:32.600
In 2002, the Miccosukee tribe was looking to advertise their new casino and turn to

57:32.600 --> 57:35.040
the world of NASCAR.

57:35.240 --> 57:39.800
Seven years later, the Miccosukee car would be the centerpiece of the most unbelievable

57:39.800 --> 57:42.560
moment in Talladega history.

57:42.560 --> 57:45.580
It's April 26, 2009.

57:45.580 --> 57:48.960
Americans are reeling from the struggles of the Great Recession.

57:48.960 --> 57:54.480
And on this Sunday afternoon, a few of them turn on the NASCAR Cup Series race at Talladega

57:54.480 --> 57:57.240
hoping to witness something incredible.

57:57.240 --> 58:02.360
In this race, they see big pileups, close racing and bizarre oddities that only Talladega

58:02.360 --> 58:04.360
can seem to produce.

58:04.360 --> 58:09.000
With just two laps left, the audience sees something truly unprecedented.

58:09.000 --> 58:14.480
The 99 car of Carl Edwards rockets into the lead and starts pulling away from the pack.

58:14.480 --> 58:20.640
He's being pushed by a car no one has paid any mind to all day, the Miccosukee car, driven

58:20.640 --> 58:23.200
by rookie Brad Keselowski.

58:23.200 --> 58:29.240
After seven years in the sport, the Miccosukee team has never won a Cup Series race.

58:29.240 --> 58:34.260
Their best opportunity to do so is now resting on the shoulders of a driver making just his

58:34.260 --> 58:36.460
fifth career start.

58:36.460 --> 58:40.900
Going into today, there's such long shots to win that odds makers didn't even bother

58:40.900 --> 58:42.140
listing them.

58:42.140 --> 58:47.820
However, with just one lap to go, the Miccosukee car has just one driver standing in its way

58:47.820 --> 58:49.140
of glory.

58:49.140 --> 58:53.900
The tandem are pursued by the Army and National Guard cars, but they're not going to catch

58:53.900 --> 58:54.900
him.

58:54.900 --> 58:57.820
Keselowski pushes Edwards to the home stretch.

58:57.820 --> 59:02.300
He looks high, then he looks low as Edwards swerves down to block.

59:02.340 --> 59:06.300
Keselowski is forced all the way down to the double yellow line.

59:06.300 --> 59:09.700
He thinks about what happened to Regan Smith the year prior.

59:09.700 --> 59:13.620
He knows that if he goes below that line, it's game over.

59:13.620 --> 59:17.820
The Miccosukee car has been forced as far down as it can possibly run.

59:17.820 --> 59:20.280
It can go no further.

59:20.280 --> 59:23.620
It has been given no choice but to stand its ground.

59:23.620 --> 59:25.260
Can Keselowski try to win it?

59:25.260 --> 59:27.980
I don't think he can step out until he waits till the lap goes.

59:27.980 --> 59:28.980
He's going to the side!

59:28.980 --> 59:29.980
Is Edwards going to the side?

59:29.980 --> 59:30.980
Oh no!

59:30.980 --> 59:31.980
He turns it!

59:32.660 --> 59:33.660
No!

59:33.660 --> 59:34.660
Oh no!

59:34.660 --> 59:36.660
And that destroyed the front end of Newman's car.

59:36.660 --> 59:37.660
No!

59:37.660 --> 59:40.660
Edwards will not make it to the flag.

59:40.660 --> 59:44.660
Brad Keselowski won this race.

59:44.660 --> 59:46.660
Carl Edwards' car destroyed.

59:46.660 --> 59:48.660
Not sure where Carl's going.

59:48.660 --> 59:52.660
Maybe he thinks if he runs across the start-finish line, it'll count.

59:52.660 --> 59:53.660
That's what he's doing.

59:53.660 --> 59:55.660
I want to finish the race.

59:55.660 --> 59:56.660
And he did.

59:56.660 --> 59:57.660
Yes, he did.

59:57.660 --> 59:58.660
To a standing ovation from the crowd.

59:58.660 --> 01:00:00.660
Shades of Ricky Bobby.

01:00:02.220 --> 01:00:06.780
The funny thing about NASCAR is that if you watch long enough, everything always comes

01:00:06.780 --> 01:00:08.780
full circle.

01:01:01.980 --> 01:01:04.060
you
