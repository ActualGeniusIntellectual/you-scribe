0	12000	Legend has it that the Muscogee Indians used to race horses at Dry Valley in what is now
12000	14040	Northern Alabama.
14040	18440	The Natives referred to the region as Tallatige, or border town.
18440	23360	Eventually, as American colonists began to settle the surrounding lands, the border of
23360	27340	the Native American territory gradually began to shrink.
27340	34020	By 1813, Tallatige had become a battleground as the Muscogee erupted in civil war.
34020	38860	The Tallatige Natives remained loyal to the Americans and helped General Andrew Jackson
38860	43460	defeat the Red Sticks, an opposing faction who were fighting to preserve the sovereignty
43460	45660	of the Indian Territory.
45660	51680	In 1830, President Andrew Jackson would repay the favor by ordering the removal of all indigenous
51680	54460	tribes from the Southern United States.
54460	59600	Disgraced by their compatriots and betrayed by their American allies, the Tallatige Indians
59600	63560	abandoned their ancestral lands, never to return.
63560	68980	According to legend, as the tribe gazed over Dry Valley for the final time, the shaman
68980	77940	cursed the land and all of its future intruders to be struck with misfortune.
77940	82800	A hundred thirty years later, the president of NASCAR is looking for a new site to construct
82800	85500	his most ambitious racetrack yet.
85500	89860	After failing to secure a venue in Raleigh or Greenville, Bill France set his sights
89860	92760	on a secluded valley in northern Alabama.
92760	98460	The town of Talladega was chosen as the location of NASCAR's biggest super speedway, where,
98460	103580	rather than horses, men would race two-ton hunks of metal at triple-digit speeds.
103580	109020	Bill France probably never knew about the curse, hardly anyone did, but soon enough,
109020	113160	in one way or another, all of NASCAR would learn to fear Talladega.
139020	145540	The inaugural running of a NASCAR race can be something truly special.
145540	151500	The first Daytona 500 in 1959 immediately cemented the race as NASCAR's most prestigious
151500	152500	event.
152500	157900	NASCAR's first race at Indianapolis in 1994 was such a spectacle that it attracted more
157900	161260	entrants than any other event in the history of the sport.
161260	165820	Talladega's inaugural race was also a spectacle, but not for the right reasons.
165820	170620	Hey, I'm Slabshoes and this is an abridged version of my video on what is widely considered
170620	176780	to be the worst NASCAR race in history, which was the very first race ever held at Talladega.
176780	180640	If you want all the nitty gritty details, the link to the full video is in the description.
180640	185400	To say that Talladega's very first event was controversial would be a massive understatement.
185400	189780	It was unlike any other race ever held in NASCAR history and for all the wrong reasons.
189780	193780	First, the track was completed dangerously close to opening weekend by design.
193780	196940	Bill France had gone into serious debt trying to build this place and he needs his money
196940	198820	back as soon as possible.
198820	203700	In August, just a month before race day, Talladega holds its very first tests, and despite topping
203700	208240	out at 195 miles per hour, the drivers showed concern very early on.
208240	212220	Donny Allison, a multi-time winner in NASCAR's top division, said the track is as rough as
212220	213220	a cob.
213220	214960	It'd be a beautiful track if it were smooth.
214960	217340	The only way they're going to fix it is to repave it.
217340	221220	Meanwhile, Cale Yarbrough noticed that his tires were shredded after just a dozen laps
221220	222220	on the track.
222220	224300	He also noted lots of bumps in the turns.
224300	227780	Not exactly something you want to navigate when you're pushing 200 miles an hour in what
227780	230740	passed for safety equipment back in the 1960s.
230740	234900	NASCAR's two tire manufacturers, Goodyear and Firestone, take note of the tire wear
234900	237660	and vow to come back with harder tires to compensate.
237660	242060	The first open practice for all teams happens in September on the Wednesday just before
242060	243780	the race on Sunday.
243780	245900	And that tire issue is not resolved.
246100	249580	Guys are noticing chunks of rubber coming off the tires after just a few laps.
249580	254300	Goodyear and Firestone fly on harder compounds on Thursday and Friday, but nothing works.
254300	258580	Drivers are getting uppity, and by Friday, Firestone backs out, citing safety concerns.
258580	263140	The drivers, who just mere weeks ago formed the Professional Drivers Association, a union-like
263140	266720	organization, are talking openly of a potential walkout.
266720	271180	And the president of the PDA, Richard Petty, the winningest NASCAR driver in history, is
271180	273580	in some tense negotiations with Bill Franz.
273620	277820	But the straw that broke the camel's back was one exchange between Franz and Bobby Allison,
277820	280260	who won the most recent race just last week.
280260	284020	Franz says to Bobby, quote, I think you're just afraid to race.
284020	287820	Bobby was taken aback, but it was the quiet Leroy Yarbrough who stepped up from behind
287820	291540	him and swung and hit Bill Franz in the face, knocking him to the ground.
291540	295180	Leroy then calmly said to everybody watching, boys, pack up your stuff.
295180	296180	We're leaving.
296180	300500	And just like that, almost every single driver put their cars back on the hauler and left
300500	302740	the track, save for three holdouts.
302900	306900	One, Bobby Isaac, a soft-spoken man who never joined the PDA, just because he didn't like
306900	311380	the idea of anybody speaking on his behalf, two, a non-PDA driver named Jim Vandiver driving
311380	316080	a car owned by Ray Fox, and three, a young up-and-comer named Richard Brickhouse.
316080	320660	Richard made his very first NASCAR top division start ever just last year at Rockingham.
320660	324740	And despite that being his first race on a paved track, he finished fourth.
324740	329020	Brickhouse is a PDA driver and plans to walk, but the Dodge factory team pulls him aside
329020	334380	and offers him a new ride, the brand new Dodge Charger Daytona, a winged supercar supposedly
334380	337220	capable of speeds exceeding 200 miles an hour.
337220	338720	But this weekend, it won't happen.
338720	340220	The tires just can't take it.
340220	344480	Brickhouse agrees to the deal and turns scab, leaving the PDA that afternoon.
344480	349820	So there it is, a 500-mile race at a 2.66-mile track with just three cars in the mix.
349820	351980	Bill Franz offers fans a special deal.
351980	355420	If you buy a ticket for the inaugural race at Talladega, you can use that stub to get
355420	357540	into the Daytona 500 next year.
357540	361140	Were the two-for-one special that good, people turned out in droves to watch the shitshow
361140	362540	down in Alabama.
362540	366820	But Big Bill has one more trick up his sleeve to make the race just a little less ridiculous.
366820	371140	He poaches drivers from the preliminary race on Saturday, the Grand American Series, who
371140	374740	race smaller pony cars on the infield road course, not the big track.
374740	379100	Instead of Chargers, Chevelles, Torino's, and Roadrunners, they race Camaros, Mustangs,
379100	381540	Darts, and even one AMC Javelin.
381540	386500	These cars were never intended to drive on a track this big, and they can barely do 160
386500	388680	miles an hour with the wind at their backs.
388680	391340	Not to mention, there's no way they could pass tech inspection.
391340	393840	These are cars from a completely different series.
393840	397780	So Big Bill Franz calls an audible and just changes the minimum speed requirements and
397780	401420	the inspection templates, all with just a simple wave of the hand.
401420	405420	And just in case any driver is thinking of backing out, he offers cash bonuses just to
405420	408860	roll off the grid on top of the already stated winnings purse.
408860	412820	But with so much tension looming in the air over this slapdash ramshackle affair of a
412820	415920	race, the stage is set for a disaster to occur, and it does.
415920	418240	But not in the way anybody expected.
418240	422840	That tire issue is resolved at the 11th hour, when Goodyear flies in their last Hail Mary,
422840	424760	and those tires finally held up.
424760	426960	There wasn't a single tire failure that day.
426960	431200	No, what did this race in was one of my favorite parts of old NASCAR racing.
431200	432900	The scoring error.
432900	436660	Electronic transponders and timing and scoring didn't exist yet, so officials would move
436660	439820	placards around on a desk to keep track of all the cars.
439820	442340	If the officials agreed on the running order, then it was final.
442340	444320	But every once in a while, they got it wrong.
444400	445960	Well, that happened in this race.
445960	450200	That's right, with only three cars even being competitive, NASCAR still lost track
450200	454780	of Jim Vandiver and Richard Brickhouse, the two guys competing for the lead.
454780	458200	Bobby Isaac was taking it easy just worrying about finishing so he could have some easy
458200	461720	points to make a run at the championship with all of his competition sitting at home.
461720	465320	Richard Brickhouse has declared the winner by NASCAR officials, but Jim Vandiver and
465320	468340	his car owner Ray Fox are adamant that they've won.
468340	472240	And even the radio call with two-time Cup Series champion Ned Jarrett in the booth thought
472240	474180	Jim Vandiver was in the lead.
474180	477720	And I think it's worth noting that Jim was driving the older model of Dodge Charger and
477720	479940	was not affiliated with Chrysler Corp.
479940	484380	Meanwhile, Brickhouse was driving the Dodge Factory entry, and it was the first race ever
484380	486420	for their new winged Wonder Car.
486420	490800	Rumors persist that the scoring error was not an accident, and Chrysler executives sweet-talked
490800	493540	Bill Frantz into manipulating the finish of the race.
493540	496640	After all, they kept some of the intrigue for the event by making a big deal about their
496640	497640	new car.
497640	501540	A lot of people in attendance bought a ticket just because they wanted to see that new Daytona
501540	504380	rip around the track at nearly 200 miles an hour.
504380	508280	Richard Brickhouse's win stands, and he is absolutely elated with his first career
508280	512460	Cup Series win, and is so sure that he'll be tapped to drive the car full-time next
512460	516100	year that he uses his winnings to buy a brand new airplane for himself.
516100	520460	But unfortunately, he never got the call from Chrysler, or any team for that matter.
520460	524660	In a year's time, he was semi-retired and only racing a few times per year.
524660	529020	So there it was, a disaster of a race made up mostly of field fillers, a tire scandal
529020	533060	resolved at the last possible second, a brand new supercar that nobody got to see the full
533060	536660	potential of, and of those two competitive cars out there on the track, they were driven
536660	540780	by two guys nobody had ever heard of, and we're not even sure which one of them actually
540780	542040	won the race.
542040	546820	If this isn't the worst race in NASCAR history, then I really don't know what would be.
546820	552540	So ends the tale of NASCAR's most disastrous inaugural race, and so begins the tale of
552540	554740	the Talladega curse.
554740	559780	Over the next half century, Talladega Superspeedway would play host to some of the strangest,
559780	564880	unexplainable and harrowing occurrences to ever afflict the sport of stock car racing.
564880	569080	The earliest races at the track are possibly the most mysterious.
569080	574180	They existed in a time before NASCAR was frequently televised, and most of the footage from this
574180	577620	era is either missing or not publicly available.
577620	582660	For many incidents during this time, only the stories remain, leaving the rest up to
582660	584500	our imagination.
584500	590120	The Talladega woes would continue in 1973, which may have been the most tumultuous single
590120	592440	year in the history of the track.
592440	597420	That year's Winston 500 earned the dubious distinction as the only race in NASCAR's modern
597420	602740	era to start with a field of 60 cars, a decision that would immediately backfire on the ninth
602740	607260	lap when one car blew an engine and spilled a trail of oil in front of the supersized
607260	608640	field.
608640	612980	Drivers were instantly sent spinning across the infield grass, kicking up a cloud of smoke
612980	616980	and dust that made many wrecked cars impossible to see.
616980	622340	When the dust settled, 23 drivers had piled into the wreckage, and the Talladega backstretch
622340	625300	now resembled the set of a Mad Max film.
625300	630420	Multiple drivers suffered severe injuries, including longtime driver Wendell Scott, who
630420	634700	was so badly wounded that he was practically forced into retirement.
634700	638020	It was an outright miracle that no one died that day.
638020	643380	The following race at Talladega would not be so fortunate.
643380	647060	Just three months later, teams and drivers would have to pick up the pieces and run it
647060	649640	back in the Talladega 500.
649640	654260	On lap 13, defending rookie of the year Larry Smith struck the turn one wall in a single
654260	655860	car incident.
655860	660500	Hours later, fans and crew members were shocked to discover that Smith had tragically become
660500	663220	Talladega's first fatality.
663220	668980	Commentator Ken Squire was perplexed as the accident looked nowhere close to deadly.
668980	673840	Smith's fatality was unbeknownst to competitor Bobby Isaac, who would go on to do something
673840	676900	even more inexplicable later in the day.
676900	682360	Midway through the race, the 1970 Champion would impulsively pull his car into the pits.
682360	686880	It was at that moment, in the middle of the race, that Bobby Isaac decided to retire from
686880	688460	full-time racing.
688460	692920	Media outlets at the time reported that Isaac heard a voice in his head which told him to
692920	695520	stop racing immediately.
695520	700640	After missing the rest of the 1973 season, Isaac would periodically return to the track
700640	703160	for a handful of races per year.
703160	709360	In 1977, the 45-year-old driver collapsed while exiting his race car and would be pronounced
709360	712440	dead the next day from cardiac arrest.
712440	717000	At the time, Isaac held the NASCAR record for the fastest lap at Talladega, which he
717000	719160	set in 1970.
719160	724740	In 1975, racing legend Mark Donahue ran a time trial lap at Talladega with an average
724740	730360	speed of 221 miles per hour, setting a closed-circuit world record.
730360	734960	Days later, Donahue was fatally wounded from a crash while practicing for the Austrian
734960	736360	Grand Prix.
736360	741740	On nearly the same day as Donahue's accident, beloved NASCAR driver Tiny Lund was struck
741740	747360	and killed after another car collided with his driver-side door on the Talladega backstretch.
747360	752600	In less than a decade of operation, Talladega Superspeedway had already been directly or
752600	755840	indirectly linked to the deaths of four drivers.
755840	760740	However, following the death of Tiny Lund, the speedway spirits would look more kindly
760740	763220	on the track's active competitors.
763220	770080	To this day, Tiny Lund remains the last driver to lose his life in a NASCAR race at Talladega.
770080	774680	While drivers would remarkably be spared on the track, there were never any guarantees
774680	776280	inside of it.
776280	781980	During the 1975 Winston 500, Richard Petty's car caught fire in the pits.
781980	786840	As Petty's brother-in-law Randy Owens rushed to douse the flames with a fire hose, the
786840	793680	nearby pressurized water tank exploded, launching Owens 15 feet in the air and killing him instantly.
793680	799780	In 1977, veteran driver David Sisco was competing at Talladega when he was greeted by a terrible
799780	801640	sight in the infield.
801640	806360	His mother had been struck and killed by a pickup truck near the garage area.
806360	811760	Sisco was apparently so devastated that he would never attempt another NASCAR race.
811760	816520	Unbelievably, this wouldn't be the last pickup truck-related death at Talladega.
816520	821800	In 1996, the president of ARCA was T-boned in the parking lot and would later go on to
821800	824120	die from his injuries.
824120	829240	Along with its string of inexplicable tragedy, the early days of Talladega also housed some
829240	833540	of the most bizarre mysteries that stock car racing has ever known.
833540	840060	On the morning of the 1974 Talladega 500, crew members awoke to an unnerving development.
840060	844120	The race cars of nearly a dozen drivers had been sabotaged.
844120	848780	Teams inspected their vehicles and discovered slashed tires cut oil lines and gas tanks
848780	850240	filled with sand.
850240	855020	The extent of the sabotage was only fully realized during the race, as many drivers
855020	859420	began experiencing mechanical failures as soon as they hit the track.
859420	865180	Miraculously, no drivers were injured in the fiasco, but sabotaging so many race cars at
865180	869620	a track as fast as Talladega was practically attempted mass murder.
869620	874380	Authorities launched an immediate investigation to find the perpetrator, but were unable to
874380	876900	identify even a single suspect.
876900	882500	Whoever sabotaged the cars did not leave a trace of evidence, and to this day, the Talladega
882500	885100	Tamperer remains at large.
885100	890260	Following the worst vehicular sabotage in NASCAR history, the track amped up security
890260	895740	for future events, and while they succeeded at keeping future delinquents out of the garage,
895740	899660	they didn't think to check whether one could wind up behind the wheel.
899660	905960	Prior to the 1982 Winston 500, a few drivers expressed confusion at an unfamiliar name
905960	908140	on the entry list for the race.
908180	913860	A man by the name of L.W. Wright had purchased a race car for $20,000, which he entered in
913860	916140	that week's race at Talladega.
916140	922380	Despite claiming to be a seasoned stock car racing veteran, no other driver had ever heard of him.
922380	926880	However, in an age before detailed record keeping, it was somewhat plausible that a
926880	931000	driver could have honed their skills in some middle of nowhere town.
931000	935800	The mysterious driver managed to qualify for the race, despite wrecking his car on just
935800	938200	the second lap around the track.
938200	943060	As the crew was repairing the car for race day, Wright seemed unable to answer basic
943060	945840	questions that any driver should have known.
945840	951400	Suspicion aside, Wright managed to line up for Sunday's race and take the green flag.
951400	957080	Immediately it was clear that the number 34 Chevrolet was dangerously off the pace.
957080	962040	Wright was quickly lapped by the leaders and was ordered by NASCAR to retire from the race.
962040	966920	So L.W. Wright again, giving the black flag as he passes by us, and Wright has been ordered
966920	968400	to the pit area.
968400	973040	After pulling into the pits, Wright got out of his car, slipped into the infield, and
973040	974940	was never seen again.
974940	981120	It turned out that L.W. Wright was an imposter and had conned investors out of nearly $50,000
981120	984720	so that he could race alongside NASCAR's biggest stars.
984720	989100	To this day, the true identity of L.W. Wright remains unknown.
989100	993860	His alias persists as one name in the NASCAR record books that may always be shrouded in
993860	995360	mystery.
995360	999500	After letting what was essentially an average Joe mess around in a sanctioned professional
999500	1004600	sporting event, NASCAR would tighten up their standards for who exactly was allowed on the
1004600	1005600	track.
1005600	1010380	However, while paying more scrutiny to the drivers in the race cars, there was one other
1010380	1012420	car they forgot about.
1012420	1028780	At the 1986 Winston 500, 20-year-old Darren Crowder stole the pace car that had been left
1028780	1030980	unoccupied on Pitt Road.
1030980	1035740	He completed a full circuit at over 100 miles per hour before the police set up a blockade
1035740	1037660	and took him into custody.
1037660	1043860	During the whole bewildering spectacle, the crowd of 133,000 fans cheered wildly.
1043860	1048220	Growing up, we're all told to respect the law of the land, but sometimes you just gotta
1048220	1059660	root for the rebel.
1059660	1064280	After the Muscogee Indians were forced to vacate their lands, most obeyed the order
1064280	1068440	and subjected themselves to the infamous Trail of Tears.
1068440	1073160	Some of the natives, however, refused to go west to the Indian Territory and instead chose
1073160	1075960	to keep their destiny in their own hands.
1075960	1081080	A few Muscogee turned their sights instead towards the south, in the mostly uninhabited
1081080	1083200	territory of Florida.
1083200	1088260	The subtropical peninsula had become known as a safe haven for refugees of the expanding
1088260	1090300	American empire.
1090300	1095060	Together with various other displaced natives and escaped African slaves, the remnants of
1095060	1099280	the Muscogee would integrate into a new tribe, the Seminole.
1099280	1104040	Although they too were forced to abandon their way of life like all the others, at the very
1104040	1112260	least for the time being, they were free.
1112260	1118960	In 1819, Spain ceded the Florida Territory to the United States and concerns of relocation
1118960	1120940	immediately returned.
1120940	1126000	Although the Seminole briefly received a reservation on the peninsula, it wouldn't be long until
1126000	1130400	the federal government once again demanded they move out west.
1130400	1136660	After already sacrificing so much, the Seminole refused to budge and after Chief Osceola shot
1136660	1141660	and killed federal agent Wiley Thompson, they found themselves at war with the might of
1141660	1143520	the U.S. military.
1143520	1148380	As the American troops marched into Florida, the Seminole warriors would soon be outnumbered
1148380	1150640	by as much as 10 to 1.
1150640	1161440	Needless to say, they were heavy underdogs.
1161440	1166300	Talladega Super Speedway has always been unusually favorable to underdogs.
1166300	1171040	The relative ease with which drivers can navigate the track opens the door for the occasional
1171040	1174140	David to contend with NASCAR's Goliath.
1174140	1179240	In addition to the fluke win of Richard Brickhouse in the inaugural race, five other drivers
1179240	1184960	would score their one and only career victory in the first 20 years of competition at Talladega,
1184960	1187940	by far the most of any track in the sport.
1187940	1192820	In the early days of the track, winning at Talladega was a matter of endurance.
1192820	1197620	Completing 500 miles at the longest circuit in the sport was a daunting task for even
1197620	1200060	the most dominant race teams.
1200080	1204400	Getting yourself in position to win was often as simple as overcoming the attrition of your
1204400	1205400	competitors.
1205400	1210120	Eventually, most teams figured out how to make their machines go the distance, and the
1210120	1215020	name of the game shifted to speed.
1215020	1220280	In spite of its many trials and tribulations, Talladega Super Speedway has always managed
1220280	1223280	to draw in fans for one simple reason.
1223280	1228240	There's no other place on earth where you can witness so many cars go so fast.
1228240	1233080	The track's 33-degree corners allow drivers to maintain incredible momentum throughout
1233080	1234340	the circuit.
1234340	1238840	Talladega may be the only track in all of racing where you can complete an entire lap
1238840	1241260	without ever touching the brake pedal.
1241260	1246180	The colossal oval is capable of producing such extreme speeds that most motorsports
1246180	1248460	don't feel comfortable racing on it.
1248460	1252620	In 1980, IndyCar had plans for a Talladega race.
1252620	1257060	They would soon scrap the idea forever after it became clear that the cars would be moving
1257060	1261400	so fast that any accident essentially meant certain death.
1261400	1266840	Stock cars are considerably slower than open-wheel cars, but soon enough, they too would begin
1266840	1269080	approaching the danger zone.
1269080	1275140	Bobby Isaac managed to break the 200-mile-per-hour barrier as early as 1970, but rule changes
1275140	1279840	to the cars brought speeds down to the 180s for most of the decade.
1279840	1285980	Gradually though, speeds began to creep back up, and in 1982, Benny Parsons would once
1285980	1291560	again reach 200, becoming the first NASCAR driver to eclipse the mark in a qualifying
1291560	1292740	lap.
1292740	1298440	One year later, Cale Yarbrough would reach 202, surpassing Bobby Isaac's 13-year-old
1298440	1299440	record.
1299440	1305320	1985 would mark the arrival of the fastest man in NASCAR history, Bill Elliott, who would
1305320	1310960	qualify for the Winston 500 with a monster lap of 209 miles per hour.
1310960	1315440	Elliott's car was so much faster than the competition that after a ruptured oil pump
1315440	1320980	forced him into the pits, Elliott would overcome a five-mile deficit under green to retake
1320980	1323280	the lead by the end of the race.
1323280	1328140	Even after burning several minutes on pit road, Elliott had just ran the fastest race
1328140	1334540	in NASCAR history, completing 500 miles in just over 2 hours and 41 minutes.
1334540	1338900	Two years later, Bill Elliott would complete a two-and-two-thirds-mile lap at Talladega
1338900	1345100	in under 45 seconds, setting an average speed of 212.8 miles per hour.
1345100	1349220	It was at this point that the entire sport of stock car racing would discover that they
1349220	1352720	had ventured too far into unwelcome territory.
1352720	1358400	Talladega, it means speed, it means competition, and speed's certainly something we've seen
1358400	1360160	a lot of this weekend, Larry.
1360160	1364280	Eight drivers exceeded 210 miles per hour.
1364280	1369960	The identical front row as last year, Bill Elliott on the pole and Bobby Allison alongside.
1370180	1375540	Bobby Allison spent a brief period as NASCAR's most popular driver, and at Talladega, the
1375540	1379580	Alabama-born racing legend was always a fan favorite.
1379580	1385780	On May 3rd, 1987, Bobby Allison came inches away from becoming one with the fans.
1385780	1391780	One of the real friends of Bobby Allison is on the tire.
1391780	1395240	Bobby Allison with a horrible crash here on the front stretch.
1395240	1399700	It has torn out a complete section of protective railing.
1400000	1405160	After a mechanical failure sent his car spinning down the tri-oval, Bobby Allison found himself
1405160	1409200	at the center of the most frightening near-miss in NASCAR history.
1409200	1414480	The Talladega pace had become so fast that even a slight aberration was enough to transform
1414480	1418840	any of the 40 vehicles on track into a two-ton projectile.
1418840	1423400	Just as everyone was starting to forget about the Talladega curse, the track would produce
1423400	1428980	an incident so ominous that it would fundamentally alter the future of stock car racing.
1428980	1433720	One may consider it benevolent of the curse to spare everyone on that day, but the story
1433720	1437520	of Talladega's most dangerous race doesn't end here.
1437520	1442560	Following Bobby Allison's spine-chilling accident, the fastest field in NASCAR history
1442560	1447960	would be conquered by the heir to the Allison throne, Davy Allison, who scored his first
1447960	1452000	career victory on the same day that his father cheated death.
1452000	1455400	Six years later, fate would repay the favor.
1455400	1458060	A sad note in sports today.
1458060	1463300	Stock car racer Davy Allison died this morning after the helicopter he was piloting crashed
1463300	1466660	yesterday in the infield of the Talladega Speedway down in Alabama.
1466660	1472460	Davy Allison, a great champion and a good friend of ours, was 32.
1475460	1480660	Although his life and career were cut tragically short, Davy Allison's legacy will always be
1480660	1487080	etched in the 1987 Winston 500, possibly the most influential single race in NASCAR
1487080	1488640	history.
1488640	1493580	Bill Elliott would become the last NASCAR driver to ever reach the 2.12 mark.
1493580	1498620	After this race, super speedways entered the age of the restrictor plate, a new component
1498620	1504420	to the intake manifold designed to limit horsepower and keep speeds under 200 miles per hour.
1504420	1510240	This thin metal plate would completely change the game and spawn a form of racing so sensationally
1510240	1515220	unique that no other motorsport in the world even comes close to replicating it.
1515220	1519480	Plate racing takes traditional racing technique and turns it on its head.
1519480	1524340	It's a format that can allow the 30th place car to be within two seconds of the leader,
1524340	1527600	featuring lap after lap of three wide traffic.
1527600	1532400	Rather than raw driving ability, winning a restrictor plate race relies on the driver's
1532400	1535060	patience, timing and decision making.
1535060	1540040	Compared to the spectacular displays of speed in the past, Talladega racing would now resemble
1540040	1543160	a high velocity game of chess.
1543160	1548120	Restrictor plates would usher in a new era of NASCAR, and along with it, a new era of
1548120	1549120	mayhem.
1549120	1552320	Wow, that's not what you want to see out of your windshield.
1552320	1554560	Oh my gosh.
1554560	1559660	While plate racing was intended to make the sport safer, super speedways arguably became
1559660	1562140	more treacherous than ever before.
1562140	1567020	The frequency of wrecks skyrocketed as drivers now had far less margin for error in the close
1567020	1568700	quarters traffic.
1568700	1573700	With so many opportunities for calamity, the drivers would start discovering inconceivable
1573700	1576380	methods to wreck a race car.
1576380	1580700	Talladega had always been a place that pushed the limits of what was possible on a NASCAR
1580700	1585180	track, and the early 90s saw a remarkable string of accidents where drivers would test
1585180	1587500	the literal limits of the track.
1587500	1593420	The 1993 Die Hard 500 was NASCAR's first race at Talladega after the death of Davie
1593420	1594500	Allison.
1594500	1598220	The event would be remembered most for two harrowing incidents.
1598740	1603940	On lap 69, rookie driver Stanley Smith would suffer a head-on collision into the Turn 1
1603940	1604940	wall.
1604940	1609060	The accident eerily occurred in the same part of the track as Larry Smith's fatal crash
1609060	1612340	almost 20 years to the day after the tragedy.
1612340	1616480	Stanley Smith would manage to survive, but with catastrophic injuries that would end
1616480	1618380	his racing career entirely.
1618380	1623560	However, despite involving a driver nearly losing his life, this accident is most well
1623560	1627360	known for something that had not happened in a NASCAR race in a quarter-century.
1638360	1642320	Jimmy Horton's No. 32 Chevy had left the racetrack.
1642320	1647260	The accident compelled NASCAR to install a catch fence in the Talladega corners.
1647260	1652160	The new enclosure would come in handy just three years later as it prevented Ricky Craven's
1652160	1655320	car from also exiting the circuit in a similar crash.
1655320	1661340	However, back in the 1993 Die Hard 500, the mayhem was only half over.
1661340	1666720	On lap 132, Neil Bonnet's car was sent tumbling into the tri-oval catch fence.
1666720	1672180	Thankfully, after Bobby Allison's accident, NASCAR had strongly reinforced the line between
1672180	1677040	the spectators and the action, narrowly escaping yet another tragedy.
1677040	1682140	While it came very close, this Die Hard 500 did not live up to its moniker.
1682140	1686400	The event would go on to be remembered as the race where cars seemingly refused to stay
1686400	1688080	inside the track.
1688080	1693000	The next time the Cup Series returned to Talladega, Mark Martin would discover the true meaning
1693000	1694820	of going inside the track.
1702820	1707360	Once again, NASCAR would have to make some modifications.
1707360	1712160	Talladega has the strange ability to send cars in seemingly any direction.
1712160	1714880	In a few cases, that direction would be up.
1724000	1728840	The blowover is one of the most ethereal moments that any racing fan can witness.
1728840	1734260	We all know cars as some of the heaviest objects we interact with on a regular basis.
1734260	1738620	Most of us would have to use all of our strength to get them to budge a single inch.
1738620	1742800	And to think that something as light as air could be powerful enough to lift a two-ton
1742800	1747780	machine off the earth, well, you just have to see it to believe it.
1747780	1753340	At the speeds NASCAR drivers travel at Talladega, it happens more often than you'd guess.
1753340	1757900	Well, Darrell, a 737, of course, is designed to take off, but it will take off at, what,
1757900	1759980	160-some miles an hour.
1759980	1764220	These cars are running 185, and the roof laps do their job to keep that car from getting
1764220	1766940	way up in the air.
1766940	1768940	Wow.
1768940	1771940	Man.
1771940	1777340	In 1996, the Talladega curse finally caught up to Bill Elliott, who suffered a broken
1777340	1781100	leg after his car soared across the backstretched grass.
1781100	1785940	But the most spectacular blowover in Talladega history belongs to a different Elliott.
1785940	1786940	Uh-oh!
1786940	1787940	Oh, trouble!
1787940	1792420	Elliott's shot over once and a half and on his roof!
1792420	1798460	In 2003, Elliott Sadler would get over a full second of airtime as his car executed a near
1798460	1800320	flawless pirouette.
1800320	1804740	The number 38 M&M's Ford must have covered the length of a football field without touching
1804740	1806080	the ground.
1806080	1811220	The following season, Sadler returned to Talladega and inexplicably became the only driver in
1811220	1816340	history to blow over at the same track two years in a row, this time finishing the race
1816340	1817340	in style.
1817340	1820900	He said he wanted to finish this race with all four tires on the ground.
1820900	1821900	He did.
1821900	1829900	But he just didn't keep them there the whole time.
1829900	1835140	It's one thing to watch a blowover as a spectator, but to experience one from inside a racecar
1835140	1838380	is a sensation most of us can only imagine.
1838380	1845020	A NASCAR engine can roar as loud as 140 decibels, but in an airborne car, many drivers report
1845020	1848280	a brief moment when everything falls silent.
1848280	1852240	At the instant in which the mighty racing machine is briefly wrestled away from the
1852240	1857600	dominion of gravity, it's as if the driver has entered the window to another realm.
1857600	1861840	Do you think that if they listened hard enough, they would hear the faint thumping of horses
1861840	1864760	galloping on the Alabama clay?
1864760	1875160	Of course, in moments like these, most drivers have other things to worry about.
1875160	1880760	Ever since Bobby Allison's accident, NASCAR has been continually trying to eliminate the
1880760	1881760	blowover.
1881760	1895740	But try as they might, Talladega has always found a way to send cars flying.
1895740	1901220	While more blowovers happen at Talladega than anywhere else, the track's most iconic accidents
1901220	1903580	are of a far different breed.
1903580	1908160	Ever since restrictor plates introduced the age of pack racing, there's been a monster
1908160	1911160	lurking in every super speedway race.
1911160	1930120	It's the reason why most drivers, teams, and owners dread Talladega Sunday.
1930120	1934940	They call it the big one, a massive pileup that can wipe out more than a dozen cars in
1934940	1936420	the blink of an eye.
1936420	1942180	Talladega may have the most room of any NASCAR track, but when the big one strikes, drivers
1942180	1945420	often find themselves with nowhere to go.
1945420	1948180	It can happen anywhere at any time.
1948180	1951980	All it takes is for one driver to make one mistake.
1951980	1956840	It's as simple as someone mistiming a block, sticking their nose in a gap too small, or
1956840	1960300	inexplicably rejoining the pack at half speed.
1960300	1963760	Whatever the cause, the outcome remains the same.
1963760	1967820	Multiple drivers' days are ended by something they had no way of preventing.
1967820	1971780	Modern day NASCAR fields race with around 40 cars.
1971780	1976700	Throughout the 90s, it was not uncommon for the big one to involve 10 or more cars, about
1976700	1978460	a quarter of the field.
1978460	1982940	By the 2000s, the accidents started to become truly enormous.
1982940	1989320	The 2002, 2003, and 2005 Talladega spring races each saw a pileup involving more than
1989320	1995440	20 drivers, with the 03 race consuming a Cup Series record 27 cars.
1995440	2000520	However, the largest wreck in modern NASCAR history would happen at a Talladega race in
2000520	2003500	what is now the NASCAR Xfinity Series.
2003500	2010060	The division is essentially NASCAR's minor league, and in the 2002 errands 312, inexperience
2010060	2013400	would contribute to the mother of all pileups.
2013400	2018640	On lap 14, Johnny Sodders' blue Chevy slid sideways and started tumbling in front of
2018640	2020580	the entire field.
2020580	2025640	Drivers began swerving into each other to avoid the carnage and quickly block the track.
2025640	2031280	When it was all said and done, 31 cars were collected, nearly three quarters of the entire
2031280	2032680	field.
2032680	2037640	Out of the few survivors, most would fall off the pace with mechanical issues.
2037640	2043100	The race eventually boiled down to just two competitive cars, a scenario that may never
2043100	2046000	occur in another NASCAR race.
2046000	2050960	While Talladega races have increasingly turned into wreck fests, it's curious to consider
2050960	2057340	that when it so desires, NASCAR's most feared track is capable of leaving everyone unscathed.
2057340	2064300	The 1997 Winston 500 was the first race in Talladega history to run caution-free.
2064300	2068620	After crashing into the infield just three years prior, Mark Martin would break Bill
2068620	2075820	Elliott's record for the fastest NASCAR race, completing 500 miles in 2 hours and 39 minutes.
2075820	2081420	In the following five seasons, two more Talladega races would run caution-free.
2081420	2086180	As of now, it's the last track in NASCAR history to ever achieve this feat.
2086180	2090980	It really makes you wonder, does Talladega create the mayhem, or do we?
2090980	2095620	We saw a lot of communication on that restart, that first initial start, with the Stewart-Haas
2095620	2098900	teams all working together to get in line on the front.
2098900	2099900	You see them.
2099900	2101340	They're pulling away, Jeff.
2101340	2107220	Let's show you how far this first group of Stewart-Haas racing has driven away.
2107220	2112580	When everyone chooses to cooperate, we are capable of achieving remarkable things.
2112580	2116340	In an ideal world, we could do anything caution-free.
2116340	2120260	But there's a reason why idealism is so hopelessly fragile.
2120260	2125340	While it takes everyone to avoid destruction, it only takes one to create it.
2125340	2131160	As is the case with most things in America, the best you can do is survive.
2131160	2134940	What you got ain't nothing new.
2134940	2137180	This country's hard on people.
2137180	2143440	You can't stop what's coming.
2143440	2148300	How is it that when we find ourselves in the biggest place we've ever known, we still run
2148300	2150220	out of room?
2150220	2155420	Humans have always been infatuated with the concept of Manifest Destiny, the 19th century
2155420	2160640	ideal that the United States should inevitably span from sea to shining sea.
2160640	2165800	This grand vision of America was eventually realized at tremendous expense to those who
2165800	2168600	originally roamed those lands.
2168600	2174200	Even now, as we sit atop our New York skyscrapers and California mansions, Manifest Destiny
2174200	2176580	is still very much alive.
2176580	2181340	We apply it to what we wear, what we drive, how we conduct business.
2181340	2182820	Enough is never enough.
2182820	2187220	We are always marching forward to some glorious, indeterminate outcome.
2187220	2192100	Why stop at building the biggest racetrack in the world when you can build one even bigger,
2192100	2194580	steeper, wider, and faster?
2194580	2197380	Our conquest for more never ends.
2197380	2198900	Some call it greed.
2198900	2202980	Others call it destiny.
2202980	2208220	The driver's strike at Talladega's inaugural contest gave many others a unique opportunity
2208220	2210500	to race in the Cup Series.
2210500	2215700	One of those newcomers was a 23-year-old Richard Childress, who would use the prize money from
2215700	2218900	his big break to open up his own racing team.
2218900	2224220	In 1981, Childress retired from racing and handed over the reins of his number three
2224220	2230340	car to NASCAR's newest champion, a driver by the name of Dale Earnhardt.
2230340	2235980	With Richard Childress racing, Earnhardt would go on to win six of his seven cup championships,
2235980	2241540	and the Childress number three would become the most iconic stock car of the 20th century.
2241540	2246540	Earnhardt's career will always be most intertwined with Daytona, but one of his most impressive
2246540	2250820	feats was coming the closest of anyone to conquering Talladega.
2250820	2256260	Despite hating restrictor plate racing more so than any other driver, Earnhardt was undeniably
2256260	2257620	the best at it.
2257620	2262440	He was so skilled at drafting that some competitors swore that he could literally see the air
2262440	2264180	coming off the cars.
2264180	2269560	In October 2000, Talladega would be the site of his final career victory.
2269560	2275020	In possibly the most impressive display of racing mastery the sport had ever seen, Earnhardt
2275020	2280920	would charge from 17th to 1st in the final laps to become a 10-time Talladega winner,
2280920	2283380	by far the most of any driver.
2283380	2288180	He may have won even more, but, well, you know what tends to happen when someone comes
2288180	2291060	close to conquering Talladega.
2291060	2296540	This is undoubtedly one of the toughest announcements that I've ever personally had to make, but
2296540	2302060	after the accident in turn four at the end of the Daytona 500, we've lost Dale Earnhardt.
2305060	2307060	The white flag is up.
2307060	2309060	Final lap at Talladega.
2309060	2310060	Who's it going to be?
2310060	2313740	Somebody, Earnhardt Jr., Stewart, or maybe somebody out of the pack.
2313740	2316980	Look at this move by Jr. at the white flag.
2316980	2322500	After suffering such terrible loss, the Talladega spirits would shine favorably on Dale Earnhardt
2322500	2326780	Jr., who would immediately carry on his father's legacy.
2326780	2333180	One year after Dale Sr.'s final victory, Dale Jr. would score his first Talladega victory.
2333180	2338700	One of four wins in a row at the track for the new Pied Piper of Super Speedway Racing.
2338820	2343580	Dale Jr.'s remarkable success on NASCAR's biggest stage would make him an instant fan
2343580	2344800	favorite.
2344800	2350060	The newest racing superstar would carry both Talladega and the sport into its present-day
2350060	2351060	incarnation.
2351060	2352060	Hey, Ricky Bobby.
2352060	2353060	Good to see you again.
2353060	2354060	Thanks, man.
2354060	2355060	You still owe me that 30 bucks.
2355060	2356060	Oh, no, man.
2356060	2357060	You said that was a gift.
2357060	2359940	You're a dirty liar.
2359940	2364820	By now, Talladega had become so infamous in pop culture that someone was bound to make
2364820	2366580	a movie about it.
2366580	2372660	2006 saw the release of the Will Ferrell comedy Talladega Nights, a film that features a winless
2372660	2376860	driver growing resentful of his more successful teammate.
2376860	2382700	Strangely enough, in NASCAR's first race at Talladega after the film's release, a near-identical
2382700	2385660	storyline would play out in reality.
2385660	2391600	Back in the 2006 Daytona 500, Brian Vickers is leading with just 15 laps to go and has
2391600	2396020	a chance to score his first career victory in the biggest race of the year.
2396020	2402020	Unfortunately for Brian, his teammate Jimmy Johnson passes him and goes on to win instead.
2402020	2407220	Two months later at the spring Talladega race, Vickers once again has an opportunity to get
2407220	2408220	his first win.
2408220	2413300	Now, will Vickers be the good soldier and follow Jeff Gordon home, or does he want his
2413300	2414300	first win that bad?
2414300	2416980	He's got to get his first win.
2416980	2423260	He takes the lead with just two laps to go, only to get passed once again by Jimmy Johnson.
2423260	2427500	Later in the year, the Hendrick teammates return to Talladega to find themselves nose
2427500	2431020	to tail behind Dale Jr. in the closing laps.
2431020	2435440	Both Johnson and Jr. are in a tight championship battle, and it's up to Vickers to help his
2435440	2438200	teammate complete the pass for the win.
2438200	2450700	What happened next wasn't exactly a shake and bake.
2450700	2454380	Talladega has always been known for its sensational finishes.
2454380	2459980	Since 1980, about a third of all Talladega races have ended in a last lap pass.
2459980	2465140	Such a scenario is portrayed to great effect in Talladega Nights, which makes use of the
2465140	2467180	track's most distinct feature.
2467180	2471860	While most tracks are designed with the finish line in the center of the front straightaway,
2471860	2475980	Talladega's is about a thousand feet farther down the track towards the entrance of turn
2475980	2476980	one.
2476980	2481220	While these seem like a small alteration, this unique design aspect has affected the
2481220	2483600	outcomes of countless races.
2483600	2489020	It's amazing what can happen if you leave someone with just a little more room to run.
2489020	2494380	The name Seminole can be traced back to the Spanish word Cimarron, or runaway.
2494380	2500100	They were a tribe composed of wildly different people who all shared a single unifying vision,
2500100	2502540	a refusal to be conquered.
2502540	2505160	The Seminole warriors fought valiantly.
2505160	2510180	They pushed the US military to the most challenging and expensive conflict with any indigenous
2510180	2512560	group in the nation's history.
2512560	2518760	However, eventually, the Seminole losses had become catastrophic, and they simply couldn't
2518760	2522800	outlast the overwhelming resources of the United States.
2522800	2527280	One by one, the Seminole chiefs were captured and forced to surrender.
2527280	2533800	By 1843, nearly the entire Seminole tribe were forcibly relocated to the Creek Reservation
2533800	2535520	in Oklahoma.
2535520	2541000	Only a small fraction managed to evade government capture by fleeing into the Everglades, a
2541000	2546940	vast stretch of swampy wilderness considered by American settlers to be inhospitable.
2546940	2551840	After nearly a decade of costly fighting, the military decided that further pursuit
2551840	2554320	was no longer worth the trouble.
2554320	2561640	By the end of the war, as few as 100 Seminoles remained, the last of the runaways.
2561640	2566180	Throughout the rest of the 19th century, all of the other indigenous people in America
2566180	2569160	would be forced to submit to government rule.
2569160	2575760	Eventually, the Everglades Seminoles would remain as the last free tribe within US territory.
2575760	2581580	Despite all of their power and might, America could never conquer the Seminole people.
2581580	2585160	There are some things in this world that you simply cannot control.
2592000	2597400	Since its very first race, NASCAR has always struggled to control Talladega.
2597400	2602860	The track has served as the ultimate fulcrum for the sport's greatest conflict of interest.
2602860	2607880	By creating the world's most spectacular track, they simultaneously created the world's
2607880	2609920	most dangerous track.
2609920	2615040	NASCAR has always straddled the fine line between entertainment and safety.
2615040	2619480	Throughout the history of the track, the sanctioning body has been in a constant balancing act
2619520	2625280	in trying to prevent the next Talladega catastrophe while maintaining the track's unique appeal.
2625280	2630320	The continual addition of rules and regulations has resulted in a style of racing that looks
2630320	2633920	completely unrecognizable to the sport's humble beginnings.
2633920	2638560	And, I mean, guys were slamming into one another, they're hitting each other in the corner.
2638560	2641480	Eventually, just what happened is going to happen.
2641480	2644280	It's going to happen again, too, probably before the day's over.
2644280	2649680	Many drivers today feel that Talladega racing is a glorified crapshoot, which is somewhat
2649680	2652080	emblematic of modern NASCAR as a whole.
2652080	2655160	You know, look, these championships aren't like winning like Petty and Earnhardt used
2655160	2656160	to win them.
2656160	2659680	And, you know, it comes down to one race, and it came down to one race for us tonight
2659680	2661640	and came up short.
2661640	2666960	How far are we willing to compromise the merit of competition to manufacture a more entertaining
2666960	2669160	spectator product?
2669160	2673480	NASCAR is always trying to tweak the sport to make races more exciting.
2673480	2678040	But there comes a point where all the micromanagement becomes counterproductive.
2678040	2683600	It's just, it's idiotic to be out here doing this anyway, trying to put on some cute show
2683600	2685600	for whatever the hell this is.
2685600	2686600	It's stupid.
2686600	2688240	There's no sense in doing this.
2688240	2694200	One of the most defining aspects of present-day Talladega has been the looming threat of controversy,
2694200	2699080	where NASCAR's contrived bureaucracy ends up spoiling the race itself.
2699080	2705120	In 2003, NASCAR would end its policy of allowing drivers to race back to the caution flag,
2705120	2707880	as the practice was becoming too dangerous.
2707880	2712520	Instead, the field would be frozen at the moment of caution, a change that would reach
2712520	2715720	a breaking point the next spring at Talladega.
2715720	2720800	When the caution came out with five laps to go, fans were thrilled as Dale Jr. appeared
2720800	2722920	to make the pass for the lead.
2722920	2728380	However, the lead was instead awarded to Jeff Gordon, as he was slightly ahead at the exact
2728380	2730060	moment of caution.
2730060	2735820	The race would not be restarted as Gordon would coast to a very unpopular win, as frustrated
2735820	2738700	fans pelted the track with debris.
2738700	2743580	NASCAR would later institute the Green White Checker rule to minimize the chances of races
2743580	2749060	ending under caution, a policy that has since undergone numerous confusing and inconsistent
2749060	2751260	changes over the years.
2751260	2756740	One of the most baffling officiating decisions for any NASCAR finish happened at the 2016
2756740	2759500	Xfinity Series race at Talladega.
2759500	2764520	At first, it looked to be an amazing feel-good story with underdog driver Brennan Poole threading
2764520	2767340	the needle to score his first NASCAR win.
2767340	2772860	However, in an unprecedented reversal, NASCAR would award the victory instead to Elliott
2772860	2774020	Sadler.
2774020	2778460	The officials had bizarrely frozen the field less than a thousand feet from the finish
2778460	2783940	line, and in that instant, Sadler's car was briefly in the lead, despite being in the
2783940	2786100	process of crashing.
2786100	2790560	To this day, Brennan Poole is still searching for his first win.
2790560	2796240	And by that much, Elliott Sadler, a winner over Brennan Poole at Talladega.
2796240	2800660	Not even NASCAR's biggest stars can avoid the jinx of Talladega controversy.
2800660	2806160	Dale Earnhardt Jr. looking for his fifth win at Talladega.
2806160	2811140	Later in the 2004 season, Dale Jr. would avenge his dubious runner-up finish by winning the
2811140	2817140	fall Talladega race, only to once again wind up at odds with the sanctioning body.
2817140	2829180	In his Victory Lane interview, Jr. would drop an expletive on live TV.
2829180	2833540	A mistake that would normally be a non-issue, but it just so happened that this was the
2833540	2838540	year of Janet Jackson's wardrobe malfunction at the Super Bowl, and networks at the time
2838540	2842740	were hyper-vigilant at maintaining their standards and practices.
2842740	2847980	As a result, Jr. would be docked 25 driver points, which knocked him out of the championship
2847980	2848980	lead.
2848980	2854340	2004 was the best season of Jr.'s career, and he may very well have won the title if
2854340	2857860	all of us weren't so sensitive over a four-letter word.
2857860	2867380	2004 also marked the beginning of NASCAR's chase for the cup, which eventually morphed
2867380	2871540	into what we now know as the controversial NASCAR playoffs.
2871540	2877780	The 2014-16 incarnation of the playoffs was very likely the most busted and unfair championship
2877780	2880480	format in the history of motorsports.
2880480	2886540	In October 2015, the system would be painfully exposed at where else but Talladega.
2886540	2891340	This era decided to make Talladega a cutoff race for the next round, meaning that some
2891340	2896180	drivers would be forced to do whatever they could to avoid elimination.
2896180	2900540	On the final restart, Kevin Harvick has a serious mechanical issue.
2900540	2905460	He can barely keep up at pace car speed and is practically guaranteed to get eliminated
2905460	2907420	unless he does something dire.
2907420	2913340	So, with no other conceivable way to save his season, Harvick swerves into the car beside
2913340	2915980	him and causes a 10-car pileup.
2915980	2920740	The caution comes out, Harvick coasts to the finish line and advances to the next round
2920740	2940460	winning quite possibly the worst NASCAR finish in the past decade.
2940460	2945580	Modern day NASCAR is always throwing curveballs and drivers will adapt to do whatever gets
2945580	2947460	them closer to winning.
2947460	2952860	One of the most peculiar changes in super speedway strategy was the brief rise of tandem
2952860	2953860	drafting.
2953860	2959020	Following the release of NASCAR's Car of Tomorrow, drivers began to realize that the flat nose
2959020	2964260	design allowed the cars to lock bumpers at tracks like Talladega and gain an extra boost
2964260	2965620	in speed.
2965620	2972380	The tandem era would truly begin at the 2010 errands 499, a race that saw a record 88 lead
2972380	2973780	changes.
2973780	2979260	By the next season, drivers had mastered the tandem, leading to one of the most unbelievable
2979260	2989300	finishes of all time.
2989300	2994260	In a mad dash to the finish line with eight cars under a blanket, Jimmy Johnson would
2994260	3000140	edge out the win by two one-thousandths of a second, tied for the closest finish in NASCAR
3000140	3001140	history.
3001140	3006980	However, during its brief stint, tandem drafting represented too extreme of a departure from
3006980	3013100	what audiences were used to and NASCAR would eliminate the strategy in the following season.
3013100	3018540	While tandem drafting was relatively unpopular in its time, many fans today look back on
3018540	3020200	the era fondly.
3020200	3025220	What has never been viewed fondly is the single most despised policy that NASCAR has ever
3025220	3027540	implemented, the yellow line rule.
3027540	3043300	The
3043300	3048820	death of Dale Earnhardt convinced NASCAR to implement a variety of new safety measures.
3048820	3054100	Most of these ended up being extremely beneficial, but one change, the yellow line rule, has
3054100	3057540	plagued super speedway races ever since.
3057540	3062960	In an attempt to reduce the number of accidents, NASCAR started penalizing drivers for passing
3062960	3067380	on the apron of the straightaways, which they now marked as out of bounds with a double
3067380	3068900	yellow line.
3068900	3074080	Despite their good intentions, this change was a prime example of NASCAR trying to outsmart
3074080	3079460	the room by adding a needlessly complicated judgment call to what was a self-policing
3079460	3093260	issue.
3093260	3098460	In 2003, Dale Jr. was not penalized on this pass for the win.
3098460	3102820	Five years later, Regan Smith would not be so fortunate after he was forced below the
3102820	3126420	line while passing Tony Stewart for the win.
3126420	3132080	Even as recently as last year, NASCAR still has seemingly no idea how to actually enforce
3132080	3133180	the rule.
3133180	3142480	As Denny Hamlin went way below the line on this pass for the win and wasn't penalized.
3142480	3147240	Since its inception, countless great moments have been tainted by the perpetual asterisk
3147240	3149680	which the yellow line rule creates.
3149680	3154040	And the worst part is there's no evidence to suggest that the rule has had any effect
3154040	3157200	on its intended purpose of preventing accidents.
3157200	3161560	If anything, the rule has contributed to an increase in accidents as it effectively
3161560	3178360	constricts more cars within a narrower space.
3178360	3183560	Recent races at Talladega have been about as close as you can get to a demolition derby.
3183560	3188400	It's not uncommon these days for a race to end with less than a dozen cars limping across
3188400	3190240	the finish line.
3190240	3195760	Over the past two decades, NASCAR has made incredible strides in safety, an unintended
3195760	3201960	consequence of which was ushering in a new generation of drivers who no longer fear accidents.
3201960	3206700	Back in the day, drivers were forced to use restraint on the track because the consequence
3206700	3211640	of wrecking would be potentially inflicting serious injury on yourself or others.
3211640	3217080	Today, drivers are mostly free to take unthinkable risks on track and walk away from any mayhem
3217080	3219120	completely unharmed.
3219120	3223920	Twice a year now, drivers start a race at Talladega knowing that they most likely won't
3223920	3225120	make it to the finish.
3225120	3227120	Sorry, we couldn't crash more cars today.
3227120	3230080	We didn't fill the quota for today for Talladega and NASCAR.
3230080	3234040	If we haven't crashed at least 50% of the field by the end of the race, we need to extend
3234040	3237560	the race till we at least crash 50% of the cars.
3237560	3241760	This is Talladega, and this is the Talladega Curse.
3241760	3246320	All the way back in 1969, we didn't just construct a racetrack.
3246320	3249520	We constructed a monument to mankind's arrogance.
3249520	3254740	We created something that we can never truly conquer, so that we can spend eternity chasing
3254740	3257140	our endless desire for more.
3257140	3262520	No matter how fast we follow them, all roads at Talladega eventually lead to destruction,
3262520	3264940	misfortune and controversy.
3264940	3269240	The state of Alabama carries with it a hauntingly somber past.
3269240	3273920	It has been the epicenter of some of the most unforgivable sins that we as a nation have
3273920	3274920	ever committed.
3274920	3279440	A history that's stained as red as the clay on which it all lies.
3279440	3283780	And unlike clay, the mistakes of our past will never wash out.
3283780	3289600	They follow us as painful echoes from a faraway time that's somehow still too close to us.
3289600	3294880	We can never unhear them, but maybe if we get enough race cars together in one place,
3294880	3296560	we can drown them out.
3296560	3300380	Even if it's just for a few hours at a time.
3300380	3307140	The writer, the southern writer, William Faulkner once put it, between grief and nothing, I
3307140	3313380	will take grief.
3313380	3316300	People always ask me why I watch NASCAR.
3316300	3320200	Why I enjoy something riddled with so many imperfections.
3320200	3324820	And to that, I simply answer that we can design the perfect race car, but we can never
3324820	3327460	design the perfect driver.
3327460	3332340	Talladega may not be the greatest display of racing, but it is the greatest display
3332340	3333340	of humanity.
3333340	3338060	It's a racetrack where speed, skill and machinery no longer matter.
3338060	3343060	It's a venue that only seems to grow more prosperous through its legacy of disaster.
3343060	3347960	It's a battleground where the mistakes of the few are destined to end the journeys of
3347960	3349060	the many.
3349060	3372200	The only place in all of racing that produces no winners, only survivors.
3372200	3377260	Every year on NASCAR's schedule, there are two dates that I never forget to tune in.
3377400	3382440	When America's greatest drivers are confronted with the one track they fear most.
3382440	3388320	In the land that America's native people once called home, 40 race cars are cursed to reenact
3388320	3389320	their story.
3389320	3392840	That must be at least 30 cars in that wreck.
3392840	3398020	God help all of them because there's no place to go.
3398020	3402960	The Seminole bided their time in the Everglades for more than 100 years.
3402960	3408360	They emerged in an America that had grown rich off the lands they had claimed long ago.
3408360	3413400	An America that was now looking to move on from its centuries long conquest.
3413400	3419540	In 1957, the Seminole tribe was granted federal recognition by the US government, extending
3419540	3423240	them special privileges as a sovereign jurisdiction.
3423240	3428400	By the 1970s, the Seminole had begun using these privileges to host high stakes bingo
3428400	3433280	halls which would go on to be the very first Indian casinos.
3433280	3438680	While most of the Seminole tribe gradually integrated into modern society, a small part
3438680	3442760	would continue their traditional way of life in the Everglades.
3442760	3447320	This group would go on to form a new tribe known as the Miccosukee.
3447320	3452600	In 2002, the Miccosukee tribe was looking to advertise their new casino and turn to
3452600	3455040	the world of NASCAR.
3455240	3459800	Seven years later, the Miccosukee car would be the centerpiece of the most unbelievable
3459800	3462560	moment in Talladega history.
3462560	3465580	It's April 26, 2009.
3465580	3468960	Americans are reeling from the struggles of the Great Recession.
3468960	3474480	And on this Sunday afternoon, a few of them turn on the NASCAR Cup Series race at Talladega
3474480	3477240	hoping to witness something incredible.
3477240	3482360	In this race, they see big pileups, close racing and bizarre oddities that only Talladega
3482360	3484360	can seem to produce.
3484360	3489000	With just two laps left, the audience sees something truly unprecedented.
3489000	3494480	The 99 car of Carl Edwards rockets into the lead and starts pulling away from the pack.
3494480	3500640	He's being pushed by a car no one has paid any mind to all day, the Miccosukee car, driven
3500640	3503200	by rookie Brad Keselowski.
3503200	3509240	After seven years in the sport, the Miccosukee team has never won a Cup Series race.
3509240	3514260	Their best opportunity to do so is now resting on the shoulders of a driver making just his
3514260	3516460	fifth career start.
3516460	3520900	Going into today, there's such long shots to win that odds makers didn't even bother
3520900	3522140	listing them.
3522140	3527820	However, with just one lap to go, the Miccosukee car has just one driver standing in its way
3527820	3529140	of glory.
3529140	3533900	The tandem are pursued by the Army and National Guard cars, but they're not going to catch
3533900	3534900	him.
3534900	3537820	Keselowski pushes Edwards to the home stretch.
3537820	3542300	He looks high, then he looks low as Edwards swerves down to block.
3542340	3546300	Keselowski is forced all the way down to the double yellow line.
3546300	3549700	He thinks about what happened to Regan Smith the year prior.
3549700	3553620	He knows that if he goes below that line, it's game over.
3553620	3557820	The Miccosukee car has been forced as far down as it can possibly run.
3557820	3560280	It can go no further.
3560280	3563620	It has been given no choice but to stand its ground.
3563620	3565260	Can Keselowski try to win it?
3565260	3567980	I don't think he can step out until he waits till the lap goes.
3567980	3568980	He's going to the side!
3568980	3569980	Is Edwards going to the side?
3569980	3570980	Oh no!
3570980	3571980	He turns it!
3572660	3573660	No!
3573660	3574660	Oh no!
3574660	3576660	And that destroyed the front end of Newman's car.
3576660	3577660	No!
3577660	3580660	Edwards will not make it to the flag.
3580660	3584660	Brad Keselowski won this race.
3584660	3586660	Carl Edwards' car destroyed.
3586660	3588660	Not sure where Carl's going.
3588660	3592660	Maybe he thinks if he runs across the start-finish line, it'll count.
3592660	3593660	That's what he's doing.
3593660	3595660	I want to finish the race.
3595660	3596660	And he did.
3596660	3597660	Yes, he did.
3597660	3598660	To a standing ovation from the crowd.
3598660	3600660	Shades of Ricky Bobby.
3602220	3606780	The funny thing about NASCAR is that if you watch long enough, everything always comes
3606780	3608780	full circle.
3661980	3664060	you
