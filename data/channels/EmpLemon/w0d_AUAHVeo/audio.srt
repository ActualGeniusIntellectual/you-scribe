1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Legend has it that the Muscogee Indians used to race horses at Dry Valley in what is now

2
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,040
Northern Alabama.

3
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:18,440
The Natives referred to the region as Tallatige, or border town.

4
00:00:18,440 --> 00:00:23,360
Eventually, as American colonists began to settle the surrounding lands, the border of

5
00:00:23,360 --> 00:00:27,340
the Native American territory gradually began to shrink.

6
00:00:27,340 --> 00:00:34,020
By 1813, Tallatige had become a battleground as the Muscogee erupted in civil war.

7
00:00:34,020 --> 00:00:38,860
The Tallatige Natives remained loyal to the Americans and helped General Andrew Jackson

8
00:00:38,860 --> 00:00:43,460
defeat the Red Sticks, an opposing faction who were fighting to preserve the sovereignty

9
00:00:43,460 --> 00:00:45,660
of the Indian Territory.

10
00:00:45,660 --> 00:00:51,680
In 1830, President Andrew Jackson would repay the favor by ordering the removal of all indigenous

11
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:54,460
tribes from the Southern United States.

12
00:00:54,460 --> 00:00:59,600
Disgraced by their compatriots and betrayed by their American allies, the Tallatige Indians

13
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:03,560
abandoned their ancestral lands, never to return.

14
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:08,980
According to legend, as the tribe gazed over Dry Valley for the final time, the shaman

15
00:01:08,980 --> 00:01:17,940
cursed the land and all of its future intruders to be struck with misfortune.

16
00:01:17,940 --> 00:01:22,800
A hundred thirty years later, the president of NASCAR is looking for a new site to construct

17
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:25,500
his most ambitious racetrack yet.

18
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:29,860
After failing to secure a venue in Raleigh or Greenville, Bill France set his sights

19
00:01:29,860 --> 00:01:32,760
on a secluded valley in northern Alabama.

20
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:38,460
The town of Talladega was chosen as the location of NASCAR's biggest super speedway, where,

21
00:01:38,460 --> 00:01:43,580
rather than horses, men would race two-ton hunks of metal at triple-digit speeds.

22
00:01:43,580 --> 00:01:49,020
Bill France probably never knew about the curse, hardly anyone did, but soon enough,

23
00:01:49,020 --> 00:01:53,160
in one way or another, all of NASCAR would learn to fear Talladega.

24
00:02:19,020 --> 00:02:25,540
The inaugural running of a NASCAR race can be something truly special.

25
00:02:25,540 --> 00:02:31,500
The first Daytona 500 in 1959 immediately cemented the race as NASCAR's most prestigious

26
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:32,500
event.

27
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:37,900
NASCAR's first race at Indianapolis in 1994 was such a spectacle that it attracted more

28
00:02:37,900 --> 00:02:41,260
entrants than any other event in the history of the sport.

29
00:02:41,260 --> 00:02:45,820
Talladega's inaugural race was also a spectacle, but not for the right reasons.

30
00:02:45,820 --> 00:02:50,620
Hey, I'm Slabshoes and this is an abridged version of my video on what is widely considered

31
00:02:50,620 --> 00:02:56,780
to be the worst NASCAR race in history, which was the very first race ever held at Talladega.

32
00:02:56,780 --> 00:03:00,640
If you want all the nitty gritty details, the link to the full video is in the description.

33
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:05,400
To say that Talladega's very first event was controversial would be a massive understatement.

34
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:09,780
It was unlike any other race ever held in NASCAR history and for all the wrong reasons.

35
00:03:09,780 --> 00:03:13,780
First, the track was completed dangerously close to opening weekend by design.

36
00:03:13,780 --> 00:03:16,940
Bill France had gone into serious debt trying to build this place and he needs his money

37
00:03:16,940 --> 00:03:18,820
back as soon as possible.

38
00:03:18,820 --> 00:03:23,700
In August, just a month before race day, Talladega holds its very first tests, and despite topping

39
00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:28,240
out at 195 miles per hour, the drivers showed concern very early on.

40
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:32,220
Donny Allison, a multi-time winner in NASCAR's top division, said the track is as rough as

41
00:03:32,220 --> 00:03:33,220
a cob.

42
00:03:33,220 --> 00:03:34,960
It'd be a beautiful track if it were smooth.

43
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:37,340
The only way they're going to fix it is to repave it.

44
00:03:37,340 --> 00:03:41,220
Meanwhile, Cale Yarbrough noticed that his tires were shredded after just a dozen laps

45
00:03:41,220 --> 00:03:42,220
on the track.

46
00:03:42,220 --> 00:03:44,300
He also noted lots of bumps in the turns.

47
00:03:44,300 --> 00:03:47,780
Not exactly something you want to navigate when you're pushing 200 miles an hour in what

48
00:03:47,780 --> 00:03:50,740
passed for safety equipment back in the 1960s.

49
00:03:50,740 --> 00:03:54,900
NASCAR's two tire manufacturers, Goodyear and Firestone, take note of the tire wear

50
00:03:54,900 --> 00:03:57,660
and vow to come back with harder tires to compensate.

51
00:03:57,660 --> 00:04:02,060
The first open practice for all teams happens in September on the Wednesday just before

52
00:04:02,060 --> 00:04:03,780
the race on Sunday.

53
00:04:03,780 --> 00:04:05,900
And that tire issue is not resolved.

54
00:04:06,100 --> 00:04:09,580
Guys are noticing chunks of rubber coming off the tires after just a few laps.

55
00:04:09,580 --> 00:04:14,300
Goodyear and Firestone fly on harder compounds on Thursday and Friday, but nothing works.

56
00:04:14,300 --> 00:04:18,580
Drivers are getting uppity, and by Friday, Firestone backs out, citing safety concerns.

57
00:04:18,580 --> 00:04:23,140
The drivers, who just mere weeks ago formed the Professional Drivers Association, a union-like

58
00:04:23,140 --> 00:04:26,720
organization, are talking openly of a potential walkout.

59
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:31,180
And the president of the PDA, Richard Petty, the winningest NASCAR driver in history, is

60
00:04:31,180 --> 00:04:33,580
in some tense negotiations with Bill Franz.

61
00:04:33,620 --> 00:04:37,820
But the straw that broke the camel's back was one exchange between Franz and Bobby Allison,

62
00:04:37,820 --> 00:04:40,260
who won the most recent race just last week.

63
00:04:40,260 --> 00:04:44,020
Franz says to Bobby, quote, I think you're just afraid to race.

64
00:04:44,020 --> 00:04:47,820
Bobby was taken aback, but it was the quiet Leroy Yarbrough who stepped up from behind

65
00:04:47,820 --> 00:04:51,540
him and swung and hit Bill Franz in the face, knocking him to the ground.

66
00:04:51,540 --> 00:04:55,180
Leroy then calmly said to everybody watching, boys, pack up your stuff.

67
00:04:55,180 --> 00:04:56,180
We're leaving.

68
00:04:56,180 --> 00:05:00,500
And just like that, almost every single driver put their cars back on the hauler and left

69
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:02,740
the track, save for three holdouts.

70
00:05:02,900 --> 00:05:06,900
One, Bobby Isaac, a soft-spoken man who never joined the PDA, just because he didn't like

71
00:05:06,900 --> 00:05:11,380
the idea of anybody speaking on his behalf, two, a non-PDA driver named Jim Vandiver driving

72
00:05:11,380 --> 00:05:16,080
a car owned by Ray Fox, and three, a young up-and-comer named Richard Brickhouse.

73
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:20,660
Richard made his very first NASCAR top division start ever just last year at Rockingham.

74
00:05:20,660 --> 00:05:24,740
And despite that being his first race on a paved track, he finished fourth.

75
00:05:24,740 --> 00:05:29,020
Brickhouse is a PDA driver and plans to walk, but the Dodge factory team pulls him aside

76
00:05:29,020 --> 00:05:34,380
and offers him a new ride, the brand new Dodge Charger Daytona, a winged supercar supposedly

77
00:05:34,380 --> 00:05:37,220
capable of speeds exceeding 200 miles an hour.

78
00:05:37,220 --> 00:05:38,720
But this weekend, it won't happen.

79
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:40,220
The tires just can't take it.

80
00:05:40,220 --> 00:05:44,480
Brickhouse agrees to the deal and turns scab, leaving the PDA that afternoon.

81
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:49,820
So there it is, a 500-mile race at a 2.66-mile track with just three cars in the mix.

82
00:05:49,820 --> 00:05:51,980
Bill Franz offers fans a special deal.

83
00:05:51,980 --> 00:05:55,420
If you buy a ticket for the inaugural race at Talladega, you can use that stub to get

84
00:05:55,420 --> 00:05:57,540
into the Daytona 500 next year.

85
00:05:57,540 --> 00:06:01,140
Were the two-for-one special that good, people turned out in droves to watch the shitshow

86
00:06:01,140 --> 00:06:02,540
down in Alabama.

87
00:06:02,540 --> 00:06:06,820
But Big Bill has one more trick up his sleeve to make the race just a little less ridiculous.

88
00:06:06,820 --> 00:06:11,140
He poaches drivers from the preliminary race on Saturday, the Grand American Series, who

89
00:06:11,140 --> 00:06:14,740
race smaller pony cars on the infield road course, not the big track.

90
00:06:14,740 --> 00:06:19,100
Instead of Chargers, Chevelles, Torino's, and Roadrunners, they race Camaros, Mustangs,

91
00:06:19,100 --> 00:06:21,540
Darts, and even one AMC Javelin.

92
00:06:21,540 --> 00:06:26,500
These cars were never intended to drive on a track this big, and they can barely do 160

93
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:28,680
miles an hour with the wind at their backs.

94
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:31,340
Not to mention, there's no way they could pass tech inspection.

95
00:06:31,340 --> 00:06:33,840
These are cars from a completely different series.

96
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:37,780
So Big Bill Franz calls an audible and just changes the minimum speed requirements and

97
00:06:37,780 --> 00:06:41,420
the inspection templates, all with just a simple wave of the hand.

98
00:06:41,420 --> 00:06:45,420
And just in case any driver is thinking of backing out, he offers cash bonuses just to

99
00:06:45,420 --> 00:06:48,860
roll off the grid on top of the already stated winnings purse.

100
00:06:48,860 --> 00:06:52,820
But with so much tension looming in the air over this slapdash ramshackle affair of a

101
00:06:52,820 --> 00:06:55,920
race, the stage is set for a disaster to occur, and it does.

102
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:58,240
But not in the way anybody expected.

103
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:02,840
That tire issue is resolved at the 11th hour, when Goodyear flies in their last Hail Mary,

104
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:04,760
and those tires finally held up.

105
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:06,960
There wasn't a single tire failure that day.

106
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:11,200
No, what did this race in was one of my favorite parts of old NASCAR racing.

107
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:12,900
The scoring error.

108
00:07:12,900 --> 00:07:16,660
Electronic transponders and timing and scoring didn't exist yet, so officials would move

109
00:07:16,660 --> 00:07:19,820
placards around on a desk to keep track of all the cars.

110
00:07:19,820 --> 00:07:22,340
If the officials agreed on the running order, then it was final.

111
00:07:22,340 --> 00:07:24,320
But every once in a while, they got it wrong.

112
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:25,960
Well, that happened in this race.

113
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:30,200
That's right, with only three cars even being competitive, NASCAR still lost track

114
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:34,780
of Jim Vandiver and Richard Brickhouse, the two guys competing for the lead.

115
00:07:34,780 --> 00:07:38,200
Bobby Isaac was taking it easy just worrying about finishing so he could have some easy

116
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:41,720
points to make a run at the championship with all of his competition sitting at home.

117
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:45,320
Richard Brickhouse has declared the winner by NASCAR officials, but Jim Vandiver and

118
00:07:45,320 --> 00:07:48,340
his car owner Ray Fox are adamant that they've won.

119
00:07:48,340 --> 00:07:52,240
And even the radio call with two-time Cup Series champion Ned Jarrett in the booth thought

120
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:54,180
Jim Vandiver was in the lead.

121
00:07:54,180 --> 00:07:57,720
And I think it's worth noting that Jim was driving the older model of Dodge Charger and

122
00:07:57,720 --> 00:07:59,940
was not affiliated with Chrysler Corp.

123
00:07:59,940 --> 00:08:04,380
Meanwhile, Brickhouse was driving the Dodge Factory entry, and it was the first race ever

124
00:08:04,380 --> 00:08:06,420
for their new winged Wonder Car.

125
00:08:06,420 --> 00:08:10,800
Rumors persist that the scoring error was not an accident, and Chrysler executives sweet-talked

126
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:13,540
Bill Frantz into manipulating the finish of the race.

127
00:08:13,540 --> 00:08:16,640
After all, they kept some of the intrigue for the event by making a big deal about their

128
00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:17,640
new car.

129
00:08:17,640 --> 00:08:21,540
A lot of people in attendance bought a ticket just because they wanted to see that new Daytona

130
00:08:21,540 --> 00:08:24,380
rip around the track at nearly 200 miles an hour.

131
00:08:24,380 --> 00:08:28,280
Richard Brickhouse's win stands, and he is absolutely elated with his first career

132
00:08:28,280 --> 00:08:32,460
Cup Series win, and is so sure that he'll be tapped to drive the car full-time next

133
00:08:32,460 --> 00:08:36,100
year that he uses his winnings to buy a brand new airplane for himself.

134
00:08:36,100 --> 00:08:40,460
But unfortunately, he never got the call from Chrysler, or any team for that matter.

135
00:08:40,460 --> 00:08:44,660
In a year's time, he was semi-retired and only racing a few times per year.

136
00:08:44,660 --> 00:08:49,020
So there it was, a disaster of a race made up mostly of field fillers, a tire scandal

137
00:08:49,020 --> 00:08:53,060
resolved at the last possible second, a brand new supercar that nobody got to see the full

138
00:08:53,060 --> 00:08:56,660
potential of, and of those two competitive cars out there on the track, they were driven

139
00:08:56,660 --> 00:09:00,780
by two guys nobody had ever heard of, and we're not even sure which one of them actually

140
00:09:00,780 --> 00:09:02,040
won the race.

141
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:06,820
If this isn't the worst race in NASCAR history, then I really don't know what would be.

142
00:09:06,820 --> 00:09:12,540
So ends the tale of NASCAR's most disastrous inaugural race, and so begins the tale of

143
00:09:12,540 --> 00:09:14,740
the Talladega curse.

144
00:09:14,740 --> 00:09:19,780
Over the next half century, Talladega Superspeedway would play host to some of the strangest,

145
00:09:19,780 --> 00:09:24,880
unexplainable and harrowing occurrences to ever afflict the sport of stock car racing.

146
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:29,080
The earliest races at the track are possibly the most mysterious.

147
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:34,180
They existed in a time before NASCAR was frequently televised, and most of the footage from this

148
00:09:34,180 --> 00:09:37,620
era is either missing or not publicly available.

149
00:09:37,620 --> 00:09:42,660
For many incidents during this time, only the stories remain, leaving the rest up to

150
00:09:42,660 --> 00:09:44,500
our imagination.

151
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:50,120
The Talladega woes would continue in 1973, which may have been the most tumultuous single

152
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:52,440
year in the history of the track.

153
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:57,420
That year's Winston 500 earned the dubious distinction as the only race in NASCAR's modern

154
00:09:57,420 --> 00:10:02,740
era to start with a field of 60 cars, a decision that would immediately backfire on the ninth

155
00:10:02,740 --> 00:10:07,260
lap when one car blew an engine and spilled a trail of oil in front of the supersized

156
00:10:07,260 --> 00:10:08,640
field.

157
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:12,980
Drivers were instantly sent spinning across the infield grass, kicking up a cloud of smoke

158
00:10:12,980 --> 00:10:16,980
and dust that made many wrecked cars impossible to see.

159
00:10:16,980 --> 00:10:22,340
When the dust settled, 23 drivers had piled into the wreckage, and the Talladega backstretch

160
00:10:22,340 --> 00:10:25,300
now resembled the set of a Mad Max film.

161
00:10:25,300 --> 00:10:30,420
Multiple drivers suffered severe injuries, including longtime driver Wendell Scott, who

162
00:10:30,420 --> 00:10:34,700
was so badly wounded that he was practically forced into retirement.

163
00:10:34,700 --> 00:10:38,020
It was an outright miracle that no one died that day.

164
00:10:38,020 --> 00:10:43,380
The following race at Talladega would not be so fortunate.

165
00:10:43,380 --> 00:10:47,060
Just three months later, teams and drivers would have to pick up the pieces and run it

166
00:10:47,060 --> 00:10:49,640
back in the Talladega 500.

167
00:10:49,640 --> 00:10:54,260
On lap 13, defending rookie of the year Larry Smith struck the turn one wall in a single

168
00:10:54,260 --> 00:10:55,860
car incident.

169
00:10:55,860 --> 00:11:00,500
Hours later, fans and crew members were shocked to discover that Smith had tragically become

170
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:03,220
Talladega's first fatality.

171
00:11:03,220 --> 00:11:08,980
Commentator Ken Squire was perplexed as the accident looked nowhere close to deadly.

172
00:11:08,980 --> 00:11:13,840
Smith's fatality was unbeknownst to competitor Bobby Isaac, who would go on to do something

173
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:16,900
even more inexplicable later in the day.

174
00:11:16,900 --> 00:11:22,360
Midway through the race, the 1970 Champion would impulsively pull his car into the pits.

175
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:26,880
It was at that moment, in the middle of the race, that Bobby Isaac decided to retire from

176
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:28,460
full-time racing.

177
00:11:28,460 --> 00:11:32,920
Media outlets at the time reported that Isaac heard a voice in his head which told him to

178
00:11:32,920 --> 00:11:35,520
stop racing immediately.

179
00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:40,640
After missing the rest of the 1973 season, Isaac would periodically return to the track

180
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:43,160
for a handful of races per year.

181
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:49,360
In 1977, the 45-year-old driver collapsed while exiting his race car and would be pronounced

182
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:52,440
dead the next day from cardiac arrest.

183
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:57,000
At the time, Isaac held the NASCAR record for the fastest lap at Talladega, which he

184
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,160
set in 1970.

185
00:11:59,160 --> 00:12:04,740
In 1975, racing legend Mark Donahue ran a time trial lap at Talladega with an average

186
00:12:04,740 --> 00:12:10,360
speed of 221 miles per hour, setting a closed-circuit world record.

187
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:14,960
Days later, Donahue was fatally wounded from a crash while practicing for the Austrian

188
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:16,360
Grand Prix.

189
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:21,740
On nearly the same day as Donahue's accident, beloved NASCAR driver Tiny Lund was struck

190
00:12:21,740 --> 00:12:27,360
and killed after another car collided with his driver-side door on the Talladega backstretch.

191
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:32,600
In less than a decade of operation, Talladega Superspeedway had already been directly or

192
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:35,840
indirectly linked to the deaths of four drivers.

193
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:40,740
However, following the death of Tiny Lund, the speedway spirits would look more kindly

194
00:12:40,740 --> 00:12:43,220
on the track's active competitors.

195
00:12:43,220 --> 00:12:50,080
To this day, Tiny Lund remains the last driver to lose his life in a NASCAR race at Talladega.

196
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:54,680
While drivers would remarkably be spared on the track, there were never any guarantees

197
00:12:54,680 --> 00:12:56,280
inside of it.

198
00:12:56,280 --> 00:13:01,980
During the 1975 Winston 500, Richard Petty's car caught fire in the pits.

199
00:13:01,980 --> 00:13:06,840
As Petty's brother-in-law Randy Owens rushed to douse the flames with a fire hose, the

200
00:13:06,840 --> 00:13:13,680
nearby pressurized water tank exploded, launching Owens 15 feet in the air and killing him instantly.

201
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:19,780
In 1977, veteran driver David Sisco was competing at Talladega when he was greeted by a terrible

202
00:13:19,780 --> 00:13:21,640
sight in the infield.

203
00:13:21,640 --> 00:13:26,360
His mother had been struck and killed by a pickup truck near the garage area.

204
00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:31,760
Sisco was apparently so devastated that he would never attempt another NASCAR race.

205
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:36,520
Unbelievably, this wouldn't be the last pickup truck-related death at Talladega.

206
00:13:36,520 --> 00:13:41,800
In 1996, the president of ARCA was T-boned in the parking lot and would later go on to

207
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:44,120
die from his injuries.

208
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:49,240
Along with its string of inexplicable tragedy, the early days of Talladega also housed some

209
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:53,540
of the most bizarre mysteries that stock car racing has ever known.

210
00:13:53,540 --> 00:14:00,060
On the morning of the 1974 Talladega 500, crew members awoke to an unnerving development.

211
00:14:00,060 --> 00:14:04,120
The race cars of nearly a dozen drivers had been sabotaged.

212
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:08,780
Teams inspected their vehicles and discovered slashed tires cut oil lines and gas tanks

213
00:14:08,780 --> 00:14:10,240
filled with sand.

214
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:15,020
The extent of the sabotage was only fully realized during the race, as many drivers

215
00:14:15,020 --> 00:14:19,420
began experiencing mechanical failures as soon as they hit the track.

216
00:14:19,420 --> 00:14:25,180
Miraculously, no drivers were injured in the fiasco, but sabotaging so many race cars at

217
00:14:25,180 --> 00:14:29,620
a track as fast as Talladega was practically attempted mass murder.

218
00:14:29,620 --> 00:14:34,380
Authorities launched an immediate investigation to find the perpetrator, but were unable to

219
00:14:34,380 --> 00:14:36,900
identify even a single suspect.

220
00:14:36,900 --> 00:14:42,500
Whoever sabotaged the cars did not leave a trace of evidence, and to this day, the Talladega

221
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:45,100
Tamperer remains at large.

222
00:14:45,100 --> 00:14:50,260
Following the worst vehicular sabotage in NASCAR history, the track amped up security

223
00:14:50,260 --> 00:14:55,740
for future events, and while they succeeded at keeping future delinquents out of the garage,

224
00:14:55,740 --> 00:14:59,660
they didn't think to check whether one could wind up behind the wheel.

225
00:14:59,660 --> 00:15:05,960
Prior to the 1982 Winston 500, a few drivers expressed confusion at an unfamiliar name

226
00:15:05,960 --> 00:15:08,140
on the entry list for the race.

227
00:15:08,180 --> 00:15:13,860
A man by the name of L.W. Wright had purchased a race car for $20,000, which he entered in

228
00:15:13,860 --> 00:15:16,140
that week's race at Talladega.

229
00:15:16,140 --> 00:15:22,380
Despite claiming to be a seasoned stock car racing veteran, no other driver had ever heard of him.

230
00:15:22,380 --> 00:15:26,880
However, in an age before detailed record keeping, it was somewhat plausible that a

231
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:31,000
driver could have honed their skills in some middle of nowhere town.

232
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:35,800
The mysterious driver managed to qualify for the race, despite wrecking his car on just

233
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:38,200
the second lap around the track.

234
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:43,060
As the crew was repairing the car for race day, Wright seemed unable to answer basic

235
00:15:43,060 --> 00:15:45,840
questions that any driver should have known.

236
00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:51,400
Suspicion aside, Wright managed to line up for Sunday's race and take the green flag.

237
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:57,080
Immediately it was clear that the number 34 Chevrolet was dangerously off the pace.

238
00:15:57,080 --> 00:16:02,040
Wright was quickly lapped by the leaders and was ordered by NASCAR to retire from the race.

239
00:16:02,040 --> 00:16:06,920
So L.W. Wright again, giving the black flag as he passes by us, and Wright has been ordered

240
00:16:06,920 --> 00:16:08,400
to the pit area.

241
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:13,040
After pulling into the pits, Wright got out of his car, slipped into the infield, and

242
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:14,940
was never seen again.

243
00:16:14,940 --> 00:16:21,120
It turned out that L.W. Wright was an imposter and had conned investors out of nearly $50,000

244
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:24,720
so that he could race alongside NASCAR's biggest stars.

245
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:29,100
To this day, the true identity of L.W. Wright remains unknown.

246
00:16:29,100 --> 00:16:33,860
His alias persists as one name in the NASCAR record books that may always be shrouded in

247
00:16:33,860 --> 00:16:35,360
mystery.

248
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:39,500
After letting what was essentially an average Joe mess around in a sanctioned professional

249
00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:44,600
sporting event, NASCAR would tighten up their standards for who exactly was allowed on the

250
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:45,600
track.

251
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:50,380
However, while paying more scrutiny to the drivers in the race cars, there was one other

252
00:16:50,380 --> 00:16:52,420
car they forgot about.

253
00:16:52,420 --> 00:17:08,780
At the 1986 Winston 500, 20-year-old Darren Crowder stole the pace car that had been left

254
00:17:08,780 --> 00:17:10,980
unoccupied on Pitt Road.

255
00:17:10,980 --> 00:17:15,740
He completed a full circuit at over 100 miles per hour before the police set up a blockade

256
00:17:15,740 --> 00:17:17,660
and took him into custody.

257
00:17:17,660 --> 00:17:23,860
During the whole bewildering spectacle, the crowd of 133,000 fans cheered wildly.

258
00:17:23,860 --> 00:17:28,220
Growing up, we're all told to respect the law of the land, but sometimes you just gotta

259
00:17:28,220 --> 00:17:39,660
root for the rebel.

260
00:17:39,660 --> 00:17:44,280
After the Muscogee Indians were forced to vacate their lands, most obeyed the order

261
00:17:44,280 --> 00:17:48,440
and subjected themselves to the infamous Trail of Tears.

262
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:53,160
Some of the natives, however, refused to go west to the Indian Territory and instead chose

263
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:55,960
to keep their destiny in their own hands.

264
00:17:55,960 --> 00:18:01,080
A few Muscogee turned their sights instead towards the south, in the mostly uninhabited

265
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:03,200
territory of Florida.

266
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:08,260
The subtropical peninsula had become known as a safe haven for refugees of the expanding

267
00:18:08,260 --> 00:18:10,300
American empire.

268
00:18:10,300 --> 00:18:15,060
Together with various other displaced natives and escaped African slaves, the remnants of

269
00:18:15,060 --> 00:18:19,280
the Muscogee would integrate into a new tribe, the Seminole.

270
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:24,040
Although they too were forced to abandon their way of life like all the others, at the very

271
00:18:24,040 --> 00:18:32,260
least for the time being, they were free.

272
00:18:32,260 --> 00:18:38,960
In 1819, Spain ceded the Florida Territory to the United States and concerns of relocation

273
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:40,940
immediately returned.

274
00:18:40,940 --> 00:18:46,000
Although the Seminole briefly received a reservation on the peninsula, it wouldn't be long until

275
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:50,400
the federal government once again demanded they move out west.

276
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:56,660
After already sacrificing so much, the Seminole refused to budge and after Chief Osceola shot

277
00:18:56,660 --> 00:19:01,660
and killed federal agent Wiley Thompson, they found themselves at war with the might of

278
00:19:01,660 --> 00:19:03,520
the U.S. military.

279
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:08,380
As the American troops marched into Florida, the Seminole warriors would soon be outnumbered

280
00:19:08,380 --> 00:19:10,640
by as much as 10 to 1.

281
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:21,440
Needless to say, they were heavy underdogs.

282
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:26,300
Talladega Super Speedway has always been unusually favorable to underdogs.

283
00:19:26,300 --> 00:19:31,040
The relative ease with which drivers can navigate the track opens the door for the occasional

284
00:19:31,040 --> 00:19:34,140
David to contend with NASCAR's Goliath.

285
00:19:34,140 --> 00:19:39,240
In addition to the fluke win of Richard Brickhouse in the inaugural race, five other drivers

286
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:44,960
would score their one and only career victory in the first 20 years of competition at Talladega,

287
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:47,940
by far the most of any track in the sport.

288
00:19:47,940 --> 00:19:52,820
In the early days of the track, winning at Talladega was a matter of endurance.

289
00:19:52,820 --> 00:19:57,620
Completing 500 miles at the longest circuit in the sport was a daunting task for even

290
00:19:57,620 --> 00:20:00,060
the most dominant race teams.

291
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:04,400
Getting yourself in position to win was often as simple as overcoming the attrition of your

292
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:05,400
competitors.

293
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:10,120
Eventually, most teams figured out how to make their machines go the distance, and the

294
00:20:10,120 --> 00:20:15,020
name of the game shifted to speed.

295
00:20:15,020 --> 00:20:20,280
In spite of its many trials and tribulations, Talladega Super Speedway has always managed

296
00:20:20,280 --> 00:20:23,280
to draw in fans for one simple reason.

297
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:28,240
There's no other place on earth where you can witness so many cars go so fast.

298
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:33,080
The track's 33-degree corners allow drivers to maintain incredible momentum throughout

299
00:20:33,080 --> 00:20:34,340
the circuit.

300
00:20:34,340 --> 00:20:38,840
Talladega may be the only track in all of racing where you can complete an entire lap

301
00:20:38,840 --> 00:20:41,260
without ever touching the brake pedal.

302
00:20:41,260 --> 00:20:46,180
The colossal oval is capable of producing such extreme speeds that most motorsports

303
00:20:46,180 --> 00:20:48,460
don't feel comfortable racing on it.

304
00:20:48,460 --> 00:20:52,620
In 1980, IndyCar had plans for a Talladega race.

305
00:20:52,620 --> 00:20:57,060
They would soon scrap the idea forever after it became clear that the cars would be moving

306
00:20:57,060 --> 00:21:01,400
so fast that any accident essentially meant certain death.

307
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:06,840
Stock cars are considerably slower than open-wheel cars, but soon enough, they too would begin

308
00:21:06,840 --> 00:21:09,080
approaching the danger zone.

309
00:21:09,080 --> 00:21:15,140
Bobby Isaac managed to break the 200-mile-per-hour barrier as early as 1970, but rule changes

310
00:21:15,140 --> 00:21:19,840
to the cars brought speeds down to the 180s for most of the decade.

311
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:25,980
Gradually though, speeds began to creep back up, and in 1982, Benny Parsons would once

312
00:21:25,980 --> 00:21:31,560
again reach 200, becoming the first NASCAR driver to eclipse the mark in a qualifying

313
00:21:31,560 --> 00:21:32,740
lap.

314
00:21:32,740 --> 00:21:38,440
One year later, Cale Yarbrough would reach 202, surpassing Bobby Isaac's 13-year-old

315
00:21:38,440 --> 00:21:39,440
record.

316
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:45,320
1985 would mark the arrival of the fastest man in NASCAR history, Bill Elliott, who would

317
00:21:45,320 --> 00:21:50,960
qualify for the Winston 500 with a monster lap of 209 miles per hour.

318
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:55,440
Elliott's car was so much faster than the competition that after a ruptured oil pump

319
00:21:55,440 --> 00:22:00,980
forced him into the pits, Elliott would overcome a five-mile deficit under green to retake

320
00:22:00,980 --> 00:22:03,280
the lead by the end of the race.

321
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:08,140
Even after burning several minutes on pit road, Elliott had just ran the fastest race

322
00:22:08,140 --> 00:22:14,540
in NASCAR history, completing 500 miles in just over 2 hours and 41 minutes.

323
00:22:14,540 --> 00:22:18,900
Two years later, Bill Elliott would complete a two-and-two-thirds-mile lap at Talladega

324
00:22:18,900 --> 00:22:25,100
in under 45 seconds, setting an average speed of 212.8 miles per hour.

325
00:22:25,100 --> 00:22:29,220
It was at this point that the entire sport of stock car racing would discover that they

326
00:22:29,220 --> 00:22:32,720
had ventured too far into unwelcome territory.

327
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:38,400
Talladega, it means speed, it means competition, and speed's certainly something we've seen

328
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:40,160
a lot of this weekend, Larry.

329
00:22:40,160 --> 00:22:44,280
Eight drivers exceeded 210 miles per hour.

330
00:22:44,280 --> 00:22:49,960
The identical front row as last year, Bill Elliott on the pole and Bobby Allison alongside.

331
00:22:50,180 --> 00:22:55,540
Bobby Allison spent a brief period as NASCAR's most popular driver, and at Talladega, the

332
00:22:55,540 --> 00:22:59,580
Alabama-born racing legend was always a fan favorite.

333
00:22:59,580 --> 00:23:05,780
On May 3rd, 1987, Bobby Allison came inches away from becoming one with the fans.

334
00:23:05,780 --> 00:23:11,780
One of the real friends of Bobby Allison is on the tire.

335
00:23:11,780 --> 00:23:15,240
Bobby Allison with a horrible crash here on the front stretch.

336
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:19,700
It has torn out a complete section of protective railing.

337
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:25,160
After a mechanical failure sent his car spinning down the tri-oval, Bobby Allison found himself

338
00:23:25,160 --> 00:23:29,200
at the center of the most frightening near-miss in NASCAR history.

339
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:34,480
The Talladega pace had become so fast that even a slight aberration was enough to transform

340
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:38,840
any of the 40 vehicles on track into a two-ton projectile.

341
00:23:38,840 --> 00:23:43,400
Just as everyone was starting to forget about the Talladega curse, the track would produce

342
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:48,980
an incident so ominous that it would fundamentally alter the future of stock car racing.

343
00:23:48,980 --> 00:23:53,720
One may consider it benevolent of the curse to spare everyone on that day, but the story

344
00:23:53,720 --> 00:23:57,520
of Talladega's most dangerous race doesn't end here.

345
00:23:57,520 --> 00:24:02,560
Following Bobby Allison's spine-chilling accident, the fastest field in NASCAR history

346
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:07,960
would be conquered by the heir to the Allison throne, Davy Allison, who scored his first

347
00:24:07,960 --> 00:24:12,000
career victory on the same day that his father cheated death.

348
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:15,400
Six years later, fate would repay the favor.

349
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:18,060
A sad note in sports today.

350
00:24:18,060 --> 00:24:23,300
Stock car racer Davy Allison died this morning after the helicopter he was piloting crashed

351
00:24:23,300 --> 00:24:26,660
yesterday in the infield of the Talladega Speedway down in Alabama.

352
00:24:26,660 --> 00:24:32,460
Davy Allison, a great champion and a good friend of ours, was 32.

353
00:24:35,460 --> 00:24:40,660
Although his life and career were cut tragically short, Davy Allison's legacy will always be

354
00:24:40,660 --> 00:24:47,080
etched in the 1987 Winston 500, possibly the most influential single race in NASCAR

355
00:24:47,080 --> 00:24:48,640
history.

356
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:53,580
Bill Elliott would become the last NASCAR driver to ever reach the 2.12 mark.

357
00:24:53,580 --> 00:24:58,620
After this race, super speedways entered the age of the restrictor plate, a new component

358
00:24:58,620 --> 00:25:04,420
to the intake manifold designed to limit horsepower and keep speeds under 200 miles per hour.

359
00:25:04,420 --> 00:25:10,240
This thin metal plate would completely change the game and spawn a form of racing so sensationally

360
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:15,220
unique that no other motorsport in the world even comes close to replicating it.

361
00:25:15,220 --> 00:25:19,480
Plate racing takes traditional racing technique and turns it on its head.

362
00:25:19,480 --> 00:25:24,340
It's a format that can allow the 30th place car to be within two seconds of the leader,

363
00:25:24,340 --> 00:25:27,600
featuring lap after lap of three wide traffic.

364
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:32,400
Rather than raw driving ability, winning a restrictor plate race relies on the driver's

365
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:35,060
patience, timing and decision making.

366
00:25:35,060 --> 00:25:40,040
Compared to the spectacular displays of speed in the past, Talladega racing would now resemble

367
00:25:40,040 --> 00:25:43,160
a high velocity game of chess.

368
00:25:43,160 --> 00:25:48,120
Restrictor plates would usher in a new era of NASCAR, and along with it, a new era of

369
00:25:48,120 --> 00:25:49,120
mayhem.

370
00:25:49,120 --> 00:25:52,320
Wow, that's not what you want to see out of your windshield.

371
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:54,560
Oh my gosh.

372
00:25:54,560 --> 00:25:59,660
While plate racing was intended to make the sport safer, super speedways arguably became

373
00:25:59,660 --> 00:26:02,140
more treacherous than ever before.

374
00:26:02,140 --> 00:26:07,020
The frequency of wrecks skyrocketed as drivers now had far less margin for error in the close

375
00:26:07,020 --> 00:26:08,700
quarters traffic.

376
00:26:08,700 --> 00:26:13,700
With so many opportunities for calamity, the drivers would start discovering inconceivable

377
00:26:13,700 --> 00:26:16,380
methods to wreck a race car.

378
00:26:16,380 --> 00:26:20,700
Talladega had always been a place that pushed the limits of what was possible on a NASCAR

379
00:26:20,700 --> 00:26:25,180
track, and the early 90s saw a remarkable string of accidents where drivers would test

380
00:26:25,180 --> 00:26:27,500
the literal limits of the track.

381
00:26:27,500 --> 00:26:33,420
The 1993 Die Hard 500 was NASCAR's first race at Talladega after the death of Davie

382
00:26:33,420 --> 00:26:34,500
Allison.

383
00:26:34,500 --> 00:26:38,220
The event would be remembered most for two harrowing incidents.

384
00:26:38,740 --> 00:26:43,940
On lap 69, rookie driver Stanley Smith would suffer a head-on collision into the Turn 1

385
00:26:43,940 --> 00:26:44,940
wall.

386
00:26:44,940 --> 00:26:49,060
The accident eerily occurred in the same part of the track as Larry Smith's fatal crash

387
00:26:49,060 --> 00:26:52,340
almost 20 years to the day after the tragedy.

388
00:26:52,340 --> 00:26:56,480
Stanley Smith would manage to survive, but with catastrophic injuries that would end

389
00:26:56,480 --> 00:26:58,380
his racing career entirely.

390
00:26:58,380 --> 00:27:03,560
However, despite involving a driver nearly losing his life, this accident is most well

391
00:27:03,560 --> 00:27:07,360
known for something that had not happened in a NASCAR race in a quarter-century.

392
00:27:18,360 --> 00:27:22,320
Jimmy Horton's No. 32 Chevy had left the racetrack.

393
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:27,260
The accident compelled NASCAR to install a catch fence in the Talladega corners.

394
00:27:27,260 --> 00:27:32,160
The new enclosure would come in handy just three years later as it prevented Ricky Craven's

395
00:27:32,160 --> 00:27:35,320
car from also exiting the circuit in a similar crash.

396
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:41,340
However, back in the 1993 Die Hard 500, the mayhem was only half over.

397
00:27:41,340 --> 00:27:46,720
On lap 132, Neil Bonnet's car was sent tumbling into the tri-oval catch fence.

398
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:52,180
Thankfully, after Bobby Allison's accident, NASCAR had strongly reinforced the line between

399
00:27:52,180 --> 00:27:57,040
the spectators and the action, narrowly escaping yet another tragedy.

400
00:27:57,040 --> 00:28:02,140
While it came very close, this Die Hard 500 did not live up to its moniker.

401
00:28:02,140 --> 00:28:06,400
The event would go on to be remembered as the race where cars seemingly refused to stay

402
00:28:06,400 --> 00:28:08,080
inside the track.

403
00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:13,000
The next time the Cup Series returned to Talladega, Mark Martin would discover the true meaning

404
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:14,820
of going inside the track.

405
00:28:22,820 --> 00:28:27,360
Once again, NASCAR would have to make some modifications.

406
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:32,160
Talladega has the strange ability to send cars in seemingly any direction.

407
00:28:32,160 --> 00:28:34,880
In a few cases, that direction would be up.

408
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:48,840
The blowover is one of the most ethereal moments that any racing fan can witness.

409
00:28:48,840 --> 00:28:54,260
We all know cars as some of the heaviest objects we interact with on a regular basis.

410
00:28:54,260 --> 00:28:58,620
Most of us would have to use all of our strength to get them to budge a single inch.

411
00:28:58,620 --> 00:29:02,800
And to think that something as light as air could be powerful enough to lift a two-ton

412
00:29:02,800 --> 00:29:07,780
machine off the earth, well, you just have to see it to believe it.

413
00:29:07,780 --> 00:29:13,340
At the speeds NASCAR drivers travel at Talladega, it happens more often than you'd guess.

414
00:29:13,340 --> 00:29:17,900
Well, Darrell, a 737, of course, is designed to take off, but it will take off at, what,

415
00:29:17,900 --> 00:29:19,980
160-some miles an hour.

416
00:29:19,980 --> 00:29:24,220
These cars are running 185, and the roof laps do their job to keep that car from getting

417
00:29:24,220 --> 00:29:26,940
way up in the air.

418
00:29:26,940 --> 00:29:28,940
Wow.

419
00:29:28,940 --> 00:29:31,940
Man.

420
00:29:31,940 --> 00:29:37,340
In 1996, the Talladega curse finally caught up to Bill Elliott, who suffered a broken

421
00:29:37,340 --> 00:29:41,100
leg after his car soared across the backstretched grass.

422
00:29:41,100 --> 00:29:45,940
But the most spectacular blowover in Talladega history belongs to a different Elliott.

423
00:29:45,940 --> 00:29:46,940
Uh-oh!

424
00:29:46,940 --> 00:29:47,940
Oh, trouble!

425
00:29:47,940 --> 00:29:52,420
Elliott's shot over once and a half and on his roof!

426
00:29:52,420 --> 00:29:58,460
In 2003, Elliott Sadler would get over a full second of airtime as his car executed a near

427
00:29:58,460 --> 00:30:00,320
flawless pirouette.

428
00:30:00,320 --> 00:30:04,740
The number 38 M&M's Ford must have covered the length of a football field without touching

429
00:30:04,740 --> 00:30:06,080
the ground.

430
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:11,220
The following season, Sadler returned to Talladega and inexplicably became the only driver in

431
00:30:11,220 --> 00:30:16,340
history to blow over at the same track two years in a row, this time finishing the race

432
00:30:16,340 --> 00:30:17,340
in style.

433
00:30:17,340 --> 00:30:20,900
He said he wanted to finish this race with all four tires on the ground.

434
00:30:20,900 --> 00:30:21,900
He did.

435
00:30:21,900 --> 00:30:29,900
But he just didn't keep them there the whole time.

436
00:30:29,900 --> 00:30:35,140
It's one thing to watch a blowover as a spectator, but to experience one from inside a racecar

437
00:30:35,140 --> 00:30:38,380
is a sensation most of us can only imagine.

438
00:30:38,380 --> 00:30:45,020
A NASCAR engine can roar as loud as 140 decibels, but in an airborne car, many drivers report

439
00:30:45,020 --> 00:30:48,280
a brief moment when everything falls silent.

440
00:30:48,280 --> 00:30:52,240
At the instant in which the mighty racing machine is briefly wrestled away from the

441
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:57,600
dominion of gravity, it's as if the driver has entered the window to another realm.

442
00:30:57,600 --> 00:31:01,840
Do you think that if they listened hard enough, they would hear the faint thumping of horses

443
00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:04,760
galloping on the Alabama clay?

444
00:31:04,760 --> 00:31:15,160
Of course, in moments like these, most drivers have other things to worry about.

445
00:31:15,160 --> 00:31:20,760
Ever since Bobby Allison's accident, NASCAR has been continually trying to eliminate the

446
00:31:20,760 --> 00:31:21,760
blowover.

447
00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:35,740
But try as they might, Talladega has always found a way to send cars flying.

448
00:31:35,740 --> 00:31:41,220
While more blowovers happen at Talladega than anywhere else, the track's most iconic accidents

449
00:31:41,220 --> 00:31:43,580
are of a far different breed.

450
00:31:43,580 --> 00:31:48,160
Ever since restrictor plates introduced the age of pack racing, there's been a monster

451
00:31:48,160 --> 00:31:51,160
lurking in every super speedway race.

452
00:31:51,160 --> 00:32:10,120
It's the reason why most drivers, teams, and owners dread Talladega Sunday.

453
00:32:10,120 --> 00:32:14,940
They call it the big one, a massive pileup that can wipe out more than a dozen cars in

454
00:32:14,940 --> 00:32:16,420
the blink of an eye.

455
00:32:16,420 --> 00:32:22,180
Talladega may have the most room of any NASCAR track, but when the big one strikes, drivers

456
00:32:22,180 --> 00:32:25,420
often find themselves with nowhere to go.

457
00:32:25,420 --> 00:32:28,180
It can happen anywhere at any time.

458
00:32:28,180 --> 00:32:31,980
All it takes is for one driver to make one mistake.

459
00:32:31,980 --> 00:32:36,840
It's as simple as someone mistiming a block, sticking their nose in a gap too small, or

460
00:32:36,840 --> 00:32:40,300
inexplicably rejoining the pack at half speed.

461
00:32:40,300 --> 00:32:43,760
Whatever the cause, the outcome remains the same.

462
00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:47,820
Multiple drivers' days are ended by something they had no way of preventing.

463
00:32:47,820 --> 00:32:51,780
Modern day NASCAR fields race with around 40 cars.

464
00:32:51,780 --> 00:32:56,700
Throughout the 90s, it was not uncommon for the big one to involve 10 or more cars, about

465
00:32:56,700 --> 00:32:58,460
a quarter of the field.

466
00:32:58,460 --> 00:33:02,940
By the 2000s, the accidents started to become truly enormous.

467
00:33:02,940 --> 00:33:09,320
The 2002, 2003, and 2005 Talladega spring races each saw a pileup involving more than

468
00:33:09,320 --> 00:33:15,440
20 drivers, with the 03 race consuming a Cup Series record 27 cars.

469
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:20,520
However, the largest wreck in modern NASCAR history would happen at a Talladega race in

470
00:33:20,520 --> 00:33:23,500
what is now the NASCAR Xfinity Series.

471
00:33:23,500 --> 00:33:30,060
The division is essentially NASCAR's minor league, and in the 2002 errands 312, inexperience

472
00:33:30,060 --> 00:33:33,400
would contribute to the mother of all pileups.

473
00:33:33,400 --> 00:33:38,640
On lap 14, Johnny Sodders' blue Chevy slid sideways and started tumbling in front of

474
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:40,580
the entire field.

475
00:33:40,580 --> 00:33:45,640
Drivers began swerving into each other to avoid the carnage and quickly block the track.

476
00:33:45,640 --> 00:33:51,280
When it was all said and done, 31 cars were collected, nearly three quarters of the entire

477
00:33:51,280 --> 00:33:52,680
field.

478
00:33:52,680 --> 00:33:57,640
Out of the few survivors, most would fall off the pace with mechanical issues.

479
00:33:57,640 --> 00:34:03,100
The race eventually boiled down to just two competitive cars, a scenario that may never

480
00:34:03,100 --> 00:34:06,000
occur in another NASCAR race.

481
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:10,960
While Talladega races have increasingly turned into wreck fests, it's curious to consider

482
00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:17,340
that when it so desires, NASCAR's most feared track is capable of leaving everyone unscathed.

483
00:34:17,340 --> 00:34:24,300
The 1997 Winston 500 was the first race in Talladega history to run caution-free.

484
00:34:24,300 --> 00:34:28,620
After crashing into the infield just three years prior, Mark Martin would break Bill

485
00:34:28,620 --> 00:34:35,820
Elliott's record for the fastest NASCAR race, completing 500 miles in 2 hours and 39 minutes.

486
00:34:35,820 --> 00:34:41,420
In the following five seasons, two more Talladega races would run caution-free.

487
00:34:41,420 --> 00:34:46,180
As of now, it's the last track in NASCAR history to ever achieve this feat.

488
00:34:46,180 --> 00:34:50,980
It really makes you wonder, does Talladega create the mayhem, or do we?

489
00:34:50,980 --> 00:34:55,620
We saw a lot of communication on that restart, that first initial start, with the Stewart-Haas

490
00:34:55,620 --> 00:34:58,900
teams all working together to get in line on the front.

491
00:34:58,900 --> 00:34:59,900
You see them.

492
00:34:59,900 --> 00:35:01,340
They're pulling away, Jeff.

493
00:35:01,340 --> 00:35:07,220
Let's show you how far this first group of Stewart-Haas racing has driven away.

494
00:35:07,220 --> 00:35:12,580
When everyone chooses to cooperate, we are capable of achieving remarkable things.

495
00:35:12,580 --> 00:35:16,340
In an ideal world, we could do anything caution-free.

496
00:35:16,340 --> 00:35:20,260
But there's a reason why idealism is so hopelessly fragile.

497
00:35:20,260 --> 00:35:25,340
While it takes everyone to avoid destruction, it only takes one to create it.

498
00:35:25,340 --> 00:35:31,160
As is the case with most things in America, the best you can do is survive.

499
00:35:31,160 --> 00:35:34,940
What you got ain't nothing new.

500
00:35:34,940 --> 00:35:37,180
This country's hard on people.

501
00:35:37,180 --> 00:35:43,440
You can't stop what's coming.

502
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:48,300
How is it that when we find ourselves in the biggest place we've ever known, we still run

503
00:35:48,300 --> 00:35:50,220
out of room?

504
00:35:50,220 --> 00:35:55,420
Humans have always been infatuated with the concept of Manifest Destiny, the 19th century

505
00:35:55,420 --> 00:36:00,640
ideal that the United States should inevitably span from sea to shining sea.

506
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:05,800
This grand vision of America was eventually realized at tremendous expense to those who

507
00:36:05,800 --> 00:36:08,600
originally roamed those lands.

508
00:36:08,600 --> 00:36:14,200
Even now, as we sit atop our New York skyscrapers and California mansions, Manifest Destiny

509
00:36:14,200 --> 00:36:16,580
is still very much alive.

510
00:36:16,580 --> 00:36:21,340
We apply it to what we wear, what we drive, how we conduct business.

511
00:36:21,340 --> 00:36:22,820
Enough is never enough.

512
00:36:22,820 --> 00:36:27,220
We are always marching forward to some glorious, indeterminate outcome.

513
00:36:27,220 --> 00:36:32,100
Why stop at building the biggest racetrack in the world when you can build one even bigger,

514
00:36:32,100 --> 00:36:34,580
steeper, wider, and faster?

515
00:36:34,580 --> 00:36:37,380
Our conquest for more never ends.

516
00:36:37,380 --> 00:36:38,900
Some call it greed.

517
00:36:38,900 --> 00:36:42,980
Others call it destiny.

518
00:36:42,980 --> 00:36:48,220
The driver's strike at Talladega's inaugural contest gave many others a unique opportunity

519
00:36:48,220 --> 00:36:50,500
to race in the Cup Series.

520
00:36:50,500 --> 00:36:55,700
One of those newcomers was a 23-year-old Richard Childress, who would use the prize money from

521
00:36:55,700 --> 00:36:58,900
his big break to open up his own racing team.

522
00:36:58,900 --> 00:37:04,220
In 1981, Childress retired from racing and handed over the reins of his number three

523
00:37:04,220 --> 00:37:10,340
car to NASCAR's newest champion, a driver by the name of Dale Earnhardt.

524
00:37:10,340 --> 00:37:15,980
With Richard Childress racing, Earnhardt would go on to win six of his seven cup championships,

525
00:37:15,980 --> 00:37:21,540
and the Childress number three would become the most iconic stock car of the 20th century.

526
00:37:21,540 --> 00:37:26,540
Earnhardt's career will always be most intertwined with Daytona, but one of his most impressive

527
00:37:26,540 --> 00:37:30,820
feats was coming the closest of anyone to conquering Talladega.

528
00:37:30,820 --> 00:37:36,260
Despite hating restrictor plate racing more so than any other driver, Earnhardt was undeniably

529
00:37:36,260 --> 00:37:37,620
the best at it.

530
00:37:37,620 --> 00:37:42,440
He was so skilled at drafting that some competitors swore that he could literally see the air

531
00:37:42,440 --> 00:37:44,180
coming off the cars.

532
00:37:44,180 --> 00:37:49,560
In October 2000, Talladega would be the site of his final career victory.

533
00:37:49,560 --> 00:37:55,020
In possibly the most impressive display of racing mastery the sport had ever seen, Earnhardt

534
00:37:55,020 --> 00:38:00,920
would charge from 17th to 1st in the final laps to become a 10-time Talladega winner,

535
00:38:00,920 --> 00:38:03,380
by far the most of any driver.

536
00:38:03,380 --> 00:38:08,180
He may have won even more, but, well, you know what tends to happen when someone comes

537
00:38:08,180 --> 00:38:11,060
close to conquering Talladega.

538
00:38:11,060 --> 00:38:16,540
This is undoubtedly one of the toughest announcements that I've ever personally had to make, but

539
00:38:16,540 --> 00:38:22,060
after the accident in turn four at the end of the Daytona 500, we've lost Dale Earnhardt.

540
00:38:25,060 --> 00:38:27,060
The white flag is up.

541
00:38:27,060 --> 00:38:29,060
Final lap at Talladega.

542
00:38:29,060 --> 00:38:30,060
Who's it going to be?

543
00:38:30,060 --> 00:38:33,740
Somebody, Earnhardt Jr., Stewart, or maybe somebody out of the pack.

544
00:38:33,740 --> 00:38:36,980
Look at this move by Jr. at the white flag.

545
00:38:36,980 --> 00:38:42,500
After suffering such terrible loss, the Talladega spirits would shine favorably on Dale Earnhardt

546
00:38:42,500 --> 00:38:46,780
Jr., who would immediately carry on his father's legacy.

547
00:38:46,780 --> 00:38:53,180
One year after Dale Sr.'s final victory, Dale Jr. would score his first Talladega victory.

548
00:38:53,180 --> 00:38:58,700
One of four wins in a row at the track for the new Pied Piper of Super Speedway Racing.

549
00:38:58,820 --> 00:39:03,580
Dale Jr.'s remarkable success on NASCAR's biggest stage would make him an instant fan

550
00:39:03,580 --> 00:39:04,800
favorite.

551
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:10,060
The newest racing superstar would carry both Talladega and the sport into its present-day

552
00:39:10,060 --> 00:39:11,060
incarnation.

553
00:39:11,060 --> 00:39:12,060
Hey, Ricky Bobby.

554
00:39:12,060 --> 00:39:13,060
Good to see you again.

555
00:39:13,060 --> 00:39:14,060
Thanks, man.

556
00:39:14,060 --> 00:39:15,060
You still owe me that 30 bucks.

557
00:39:15,060 --> 00:39:16,060
Oh, no, man.

558
00:39:16,060 --> 00:39:17,060
You said that was a gift.

559
00:39:17,060 --> 00:39:19,940
You're a dirty liar.

560
00:39:19,940 --> 00:39:24,820
By now, Talladega had become so infamous in pop culture that someone was bound to make

561
00:39:24,820 --> 00:39:26,580
a movie about it.

562
00:39:26,580 --> 00:39:32,660
2006 saw the release of the Will Ferrell comedy Talladega Nights, a film that features a winless

563
00:39:32,660 --> 00:39:36,860
driver growing resentful of his more successful teammate.

564
00:39:36,860 --> 00:39:42,700
Strangely enough, in NASCAR's first race at Talladega after the film's release, a near-identical

565
00:39:42,700 --> 00:39:45,660
storyline would play out in reality.

566
00:39:45,660 --> 00:39:51,600
Back in the 2006 Daytona 500, Brian Vickers is leading with just 15 laps to go and has

567
00:39:51,600 --> 00:39:56,020
a chance to score his first career victory in the biggest race of the year.

568
00:39:56,020 --> 00:40:02,020
Unfortunately for Brian, his teammate Jimmy Johnson passes him and goes on to win instead.

569
00:40:02,020 --> 00:40:07,220
Two months later at the spring Talladega race, Vickers once again has an opportunity to get

570
00:40:07,220 --> 00:40:08,220
his first win.

571
00:40:08,220 --> 00:40:13,300
Now, will Vickers be the good soldier and follow Jeff Gordon home, or does he want his

572
00:40:13,300 --> 00:40:14,300
first win that bad?

573
00:40:14,300 --> 00:40:16,980
He's got to get his first win.

574
00:40:16,980 --> 00:40:23,260
He takes the lead with just two laps to go, only to get passed once again by Jimmy Johnson.

575
00:40:23,260 --> 00:40:27,500
Later in the year, the Hendrick teammates return to Talladega to find themselves nose

576
00:40:27,500 --> 00:40:31,020
to tail behind Dale Jr. in the closing laps.

577
00:40:31,020 --> 00:40:35,440
Both Johnson and Jr. are in a tight championship battle, and it's up to Vickers to help his

578
00:40:35,440 --> 00:40:38,200
teammate complete the pass for the win.

579
00:40:38,200 --> 00:40:50,700
What happened next wasn't exactly a shake and bake.

580
00:40:50,700 --> 00:40:54,380
Talladega has always been known for its sensational finishes.

581
00:40:54,380 --> 00:40:59,980
Since 1980, about a third of all Talladega races have ended in a last lap pass.

582
00:40:59,980 --> 00:41:05,140
Such a scenario is portrayed to great effect in Talladega Nights, which makes use of the

583
00:41:05,140 --> 00:41:07,180
track's most distinct feature.

584
00:41:07,180 --> 00:41:11,860
While most tracks are designed with the finish line in the center of the front straightaway,

585
00:41:11,860 --> 00:41:15,980
Talladega's is about a thousand feet farther down the track towards the entrance of turn

586
00:41:15,980 --> 00:41:16,980
one.

587
00:41:16,980 --> 00:41:21,220
While these seem like a small alteration, this unique design aspect has affected the

588
00:41:21,220 --> 00:41:23,600
outcomes of countless races.

589
00:41:23,600 --> 00:41:29,020
It's amazing what can happen if you leave someone with just a little more room to run.

590
00:41:29,020 --> 00:41:34,380
The name Seminole can be traced back to the Spanish word Cimarron, or runaway.

591
00:41:34,380 --> 00:41:40,100
They were a tribe composed of wildly different people who all shared a single unifying vision,

592
00:41:40,100 --> 00:41:42,540
a refusal to be conquered.

593
00:41:42,540 --> 00:41:45,160
The Seminole warriors fought valiantly.

594
00:41:45,160 --> 00:41:50,180
They pushed the US military to the most challenging and expensive conflict with any indigenous

595
00:41:50,180 --> 00:41:52,560
group in the nation's history.

596
00:41:52,560 --> 00:41:58,760
However, eventually, the Seminole losses had become catastrophic, and they simply couldn't

597
00:41:58,760 --> 00:42:02,800
outlast the overwhelming resources of the United States.

598
00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:07,280
One by one, the Seminole chiefs were captured and forced to surrender.

599
00:42:07,280 --> 00:42:13,800
By 1843, nearly the entire Seminole tribe were forcibly relocated to the Creek Reservation

600
00:42:13,800 --> 00:42:15,520
in Oklahoma.

601
00:42:15,520 --> 00:42:21,000
Only a small fraction managed to evade government capture by fleeing into the Everglades, a

602
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:26,940
vast stretch of swampy wilderness considered by American settlers to be inhospitable.

603
00:42:26,940 --> 00:42:31,840
After nearly a decade of costly fighting, the military decided that further pursuit

604
00:42:31,840 --> 00:42:34,320
was no longer worth the trouble.

605
00:42:34,320 --> 00:42:41,640
By the end of the war, as few as 100 Seminoles remained, the last of the runaways.

606
00:42:41,640 --> 00:42:46,180
Throughout the rest of the 19th century, all of the other indigenous people in America

607
00:42:46,180 --> 00:42:49,160
would be forced to submit to government rule.

608
00:42:49,160 --> 00:42:55,760
Eventually, the Everglades Seminoles would remain as the last free tribe within US territory.

609
00:42:55,760 --> 00:43:01,580
Despite all of their power and might, America could never conquer the Seminole people.

610
00:43:01,580 --> 00:43:05,160
There are some things in this world that you simply cannot control.

611
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:17,400
Since its very first race, NASCAR has always struggled to control Talladega.

612
00:43:17,400 --> 00:43:22,860
The track has served as the ultimate fulcrum for the sport's greatest conflict of interest.

613
00:43:22,860 --> 00:43:27,880
By creating the world's most spectacular track, they simultaneously created the world's

614
00:43:27,880 --> 00:43:29,920
most dangerous track.

615
00:43:29,920 --> 00:43:35,040
NASCAR has always straddled the fine line between entertainment and safety.

616
00:43:35,040 --> 00:43:39,480
Throughout the history of the track, the sanctioning body has been in a constant balancing act

617
00:43:39,520 --> 00:43:45,280
in trying to prevent the next Talladega catastrophe while maintaining the track's unique appeal.

618
00:43:45,280 --> 00:43:50,320
The continual addition of rules and regulations has resulted in a style of racing that looks

619
00:43:50,320 --> 00:43:53,920
completely unrecognizable to the sport's humble beginnings.

620
00:43:53,920 --> 00:43:58,560
And, I mean, guys were slamming into one another, they're hitting each other in the corner.

621
00:43:58,560 --> 00:44:01,480
Eventually, just what happened is going to happen.

622
00:44:01,480 --> 00:44:04,280
It's going to happen again, too, probably before the day's over.

623
00:44:04,280 --> 00:44:09,680
Many drivers today feel that Talladega racing is a glorified crapshoot, which is somewhat

624
00:44:09,680 --> 00:44:12,080
emblematic of modern NASCAR as a whole.

625
00:44:12,080 --> 00:44:15,160
You know, look, these championships aren't like winning like Petty and Earnhardt used

626
00:44:15,160 --> 00:44:16,160
to win them.

627
00:44:16,160 --> 00:44:19,680
And, you know, it comes down to one race, and it came down to one race for us tonight

628
00:44:19,680 --> 00:44:21,640
and came up short.

629
00:44:21,640 --> 00:44:26,960
How far are we willing to compromise the merit of competition to manufacture a more entertaining

630
00:44:26,960 --> 00:44:29,160
spectator product?

631
00:44:29,160 --> 00:44:33,480
NASCAR is always trying to tweak the sport to make races more exciting.

632
00:44:33,480 --> 00:44:38,040
But there comes a point where all the micromanagement becomes counterproductive.

633
00:44:38,040 --> 00:44:43,600
It's just, it's idiotic to be out here doing this anyway, trying to put on some cute show

634
00:44:43,600 --> 00:44:45,600
for whatever the hell this is.

635
00:44:45,600 --> 00:44:46,600
It's stupid.

636
00:44:46,600 --> 00:44:48,240
There's no sense in doing this.

637
00:44:48,240 --> 00:44:54,200
One of the most defining aspects of present-day Talladega has been the looming threat of controversy,

638
00:44:54,200 --> 00:44:59,080
where NASCAR's contrived bureaucracy ends up spoiling the race itself.

639
00:44:59,080 --> 00:45:05,120
In 2003, NASCAR would end its policy of allowing drivers to race back to the caution flag,

640
00:45:05,120 --> 00:45:07,880
as the practice was becoming too dangerous.

641
00:45:07,880 --> 00:45:12,520
Instead, the field would be frozen at the moment of caution, a change that would reach

642
00:45:12,520 --> 00:45:15,720
a breaking point the next spring at Talladega.

643
00:45:15,720 --> 00:45:20,800
When the caution came out with five laps to go, fans were thrilled as Dale Jr. appeared

644
00:45:20,800 --> 00:45:22,920
to make the pass for the lead.

645
00:45:22,920 --> 00:45:28,380
However, the lead was instead awarded to Jeff Gordon, as he was slightly ahead at the exact

646
00:45:28,380 --> 00:45:30,060
moment of caution.

647
00:45:30,060 --> 00:45:35,820
The race would not be restarted as Gordon would coast to a very unpopular win, as frustrated

648
00:45:35,820 --> 00:45:38,700
fans pelted the track with debris.

649
00:45:38,700 --> 00:45:43,580
NASCAR would later institute the Green White Checker rule to minimize the chances of races

650
00:45:43,580 --> 00:45:49,060
ending under caution, a policy that has since undergone numerous confusing and inconsistent

651
00:45:49,060 --> 00:45:51,260
changes over the years.

652
00:45:51,260 --> 00:45:56,740
One of the most baffling officiating decisions for any NASCAR finish happened at the 2016

653
00:45:56,740 --> 00:45:59,500
Xfinity Series race at Talladega.

654
00:45:59,500 --> 00:46:04,520
At first, it looked to be an amazing feel-good story with underdog driver Brennan Poole threading

655
00:46:04,520 --> 00:46:07,340
the needle to score his first NASCAR win.

656
00:46:07,340 --> 00:46:12,860
However, in an unprecedented reversal, NASCAR would award the victory instead to Elliott

657
00:46:12,860 --> 00:46:14,020
Sadler.

658
00:46:14,020 --> 00:46:18,460
The officials had bizarrely frozen the field less than a thousand feet from the finish

659
00:46:18,460 --> 00:46:23,940
line, and in that instant, Sadler's car was briefly in the lead, despite being in the

660
00:46:23,940 --> 00:46:26,100
process of crashing.

661
00:46:26,100 --> 00:46:30,560
To this day, Brennan Poole is still searching for his first win.

662
00:46:30,560 --> 00:46:36,240
And by that much, Elliott Sadler, a winner over Brennan Poole at Talladega.

663
00:46:36,240 --> 00:46:40,660
Not even NASCAR's biggest stars can avoid the jinx of Talladega controversy.

664
00:46:40,660 --> 00:46:46,160
Dale Earnhardt Jr. looking for his fifth win at Talladega.

665
00:46:46,160 --> 00:46:51,140
Later in the 2004 season, Dale Jr. would avenge his dubious runner-up finish by winning the

666
00:46:51,140 --> 00:46:57,140
fall Talladega race, only to once again wind up at odds with the sanctioning body.

667
00:46:57,140 --> 00:47:09,180
In his Victory Lane interview, Jr. would drop an expletive on live TV.

668
00:47:09,180 --> 00:47:13,540
A mistake that would normally be a non-issue, but it just so happened that this was the

669
00:47:13,540 --> 00:47:18,540
year of Janet Jackson's wardrobe malfunction at the Super Bowl, and networks at the time

670
00:47:18,540 --> 00:47:22,740
were hyper-vigilant at maintaining their standards and practices.

671
00:47:22,740 --> 00:47:27,980
As a result, Jr. would be docked 25 driver points, which knocked him out of the championship

672
00:47:27,980 --> 00:47:28,980
lead.

673
00:47:28,980 --> 00:47:34,340
2004 was the best season of Jr.'s career, and he may very well have won the title if

674
00:47:34,340 --> 00:47:37,860
all of us weren't so sensitive over a four-letter word.

675
00:47:37,860 --> 00:47:47,380
2004 also marked the beginning of NASCAR's chase for the cup, which eventually morphed

676
00:47:47,380 --> 00:47:51,540
into what we now know as the controversial NASCAR playoffs.

677
00:47:51,540 --> 00:47:57,780
The 2014-16 incarnation of the playoffs was very likely the most busted and unfair championship

678
00:47:57,780 --> 00:48:00,480
format in the history of motorsports.

679
00:48:00,480 --> 00:48:06,540
In October 2015, the system would be painfully exposed at where else but Talladega.

680
00:48:06,540 --> 00:48:11,340
This era decided to make Talladega a cutoff race for the next round, meaning that some

681
00:48:11,340 --> 00:48:16,180
drivers would be forced to do whatever they could to avoid elimination.

682
00:48:16,180 --> 00:48:20,540
On the final restart, Kevin Harvick has a serious mechanical issue.

683
00:48:20,540 --> 00:48:25,460
He can barely keep up at pace car speed and is practically guaranteed to get eliminated

684
00:48:25,460 --> 00:48:27,420
unless he does something dire.

685
00:48:27,420 --> 00:48:33,340
So, with no other conceivable way to save his season, Harvick swerves into the car beside

686
00:48:33,340 --> 00:48:35,980
him and causes a 10-car pileup.

687
00:48:35,980 --> 00:48:40,740
The caution comes out, Harvick coasts to the finish line and advances to the next round

688
00:48:40,740 --> 00:49:00,460
winning quite possibly the worst NASCAR finish in the past decade.

689
00:49:00,460 --> 00:49:05,580
Modern day NASCAR is always throwing curveballs and drivers will adapt to do whatever gets

690
00:49:05,580 --> 00:49:07,460
them closer to winning.

691
00:49:07,460 --> 00:49:12,860
One of the most peculiar changes in super speedway strategy was the brief rise of tandem

692
00:49:12,860 --> 00:49:13,860
drafting.

693
00:49:13,860 --> 00:49:19,020
Following the release of NASCAR's Car of Tomorrow, drivers began to realize that the flat nose

694
00:49:19,020 --> 00:49:24,260
design allowed the cars to lock bumpers at tracks like Talladega and gain an extra boost

695
00:49:24,260 --> 00:49:25,620
in speed.

696
00:49:25,620 --> 00:49:32,380
The tandem era would truly begin at the 2010 errands 499, a race that saw a record 88 lead

697
00:49:32,380 --> 00:49:33,780
changes.

698
00:49:33,780 --> 00:49:39,260
By the next season, drivers had mastered the tandem, leading to one of the most unbelievable

699
00:49:39,260 --> 00:49:49,300
finishes of all time.

700
00:49:49,300 --> 00:49:54,260
In a mad dash to the finish line with eight cars under a blanket, Jimmy Johnson would

701
00:49:54,260 --> 00:50:00,140
edge out the win by two one-thousandths of a second, tied for the closest finish in NASCAR

702
00:50:00,140 --> 00:50:01,140
history.

703
00:50:01,140 --> 00:50:06,980
However, during its brief stint, tandem drafting represented too extreme of a departure from

704
00:50:06,980 --> 00:50:13,100
what audiences were used to and NASCAR would eliminate the strategy in the following season.

705
00:50:13,100 --> 00:50:18,540
While tandem drafting was relatively unpopular in its time, many fans today look back on

706
00:50:18,540 --> 00:50:20,200
the era fondly.

707
00:50:20,200 --> 00:50:25,220
What has never been viewed fondly is the single most despised policy that NASCAR has ever

708
00:50:25,220 --> 00:50:27,540
implemented, the yellow line rule.

709
00:50:27,540 --> 00:50:43,300
The

710
00:50:43,300 --> 00:50:48,820
death of Dale Earnhardt convinced NASCAR to implement a variety of new safety measures.

711
00:50:48,820 --> 00:50:54,100
Most of these ended up being extremely beneficial, but one change, the yellow line rule, has

712
00:50:54,100 --> 00:50:57,540
plagued super speedway races ever since.

713
00:50:57,540 --> 00:51:02,960
In an attempt to reduce the number of accidents, NASCAR started penalizing drivers for passing

714
00:51:02,960 --> 00:51:07,380
on the apron of the straightaways, which they now marked as out of bounds with a double

715
00:51:07,380 --> 00:51:08,900
yellow line.

716
00:51:08,900 --> 00:51:14,080
Despite their good intentions, this change was a prime example of NASCAR trying to outsmart

717
00:51:14,080 --> 00:51:19,460
the room by adding a needlessly complicated judgment call to what was a self-policing

718
00:51:19,460 --> 00:51:33,260
issue.

719
00:51:33,260 --> 00:51:38,460
In 2003, Dale Jr. was not penalized on this pass for the win.

720
00:51:38,460 --> 00:51:42,820
Five years later, Regan Smith would not be so fortunate after he was forced below the

721
00:51:42,820 --> 00:52:06,420
line while passing Tony Stewart for the win.

722
00:52:06,420 --> 00:52:12,080
Even as recently as last year, NASCAR still has seemingly no idea how to actually enforce

723
00:52:12,080 --> 00:52:13,180
the rule.

724
00:52:13,180 --> 00:52:22,480
As Denny Hamlin went way below the line on this pass for the win and wasn't penalized.

725
00:52:22,480 --> 00:52:27,240
Since its inception, countless great moments have been tainted by the perpetual asterisk

726
00:52:27,240 --> 00:52:29,680
which the yellow line rule creates.

727
00:52:29,680 --> 00:52:34,040
And the worst part is there's no evidence to suggest that the rule has had any effect

728
00:52:34,040 --> 00:52:37,200
on its intended purpose of preventing accidents.

729
00:52:37,200 --> 00:52:41,560
If anything, the rule has contributed to an increase in accidents as it effectively

730
00:52:41,560 --> 00:52:58,360
constricts more cars within a narrower space.

731
00:52:58,360 --> 00:53:03,560
Recent races at Talladega have been about as close as you can get to a demolition derby.

732
00:53:03,560 --> 00:53:08,400
It's not uncommon these days for a race to end with less than a dozen cars limping across

733
00:53:08,400 --> 00:53:10,240
the finish line.

734
00:53:10,240 --> 00:53:15,760
Over the past two decades, NASCAR has made incredible strides in safety, an unintended

735
00:53:15,760 --> 00:53:21,960
consequence of which was ushering in a new generation of drivers who no longer fear accidents.

736
00:53:21,960 --> 00:53:26,700
Back in the day, drivers were forced to use restraint on the track because the consequence

737
00:53:26,700 --> 00:53:31,640
of wrecking would be potentially inflicting serious injury on yourself or others.

738
00:53:31,640 --> 00:53:37,080
Today, drivers are mostly free to take unthinkable risks on track and walk away from any mayhem

739
00:53:37,080 --> 00:53:39,120
completely unharmed.

740
00:53:39,120 --> 00:53:43,920
Twice a year now, drivers start a race at Talladega knowing that they most likely won't

741
00:53:43,920 --> 00:53:45,120
make it to the finish.

742
00:53:45,120 --> 00:53:47,120
Sorry, we couldn't crash more cars today.

743
00:53:47,120 --> 00:53:50,080
We didn't fill the quota for today for Talladega and NASCAR.

744
00:53:50,080 --> 00:53:54,040
If we haven't crashed at least 50% of the field by the end of the race, we need to extend

745
00:53:54,040 --> 00:53:57,560
the race till we at least crash 50% of the cars.

746
00:53:57,560 --> 00:54:01,760
This is Talladega, and this is the Talladega Curse.

747
00:54:01,760 --> 00:54:06,320
All the way back in 1969, we didn't just construct a racetrack.

748
00:54:06,320 --> 00:54:09,520
We constructed a monument to mankind's arrogance.

749
00:54:09,520 --> 00:54:14,740
We created something that we can never truly conquer, so that we can spend eternity chasing

750
00:54:14,740 --> 00:54:17,140
our endless desire for more.

751
00:54:17,140 --> 00:54:22,520
No matter how fast we follow them, all roads at Talladega eventually lead to destruction,

752
00:54:22,520 --> 00:54:24,940
misfortune and controversy.

753
00:54:24,940 --> 00:54:29,240
The state of Alabama carries with it a hauntingly somber past.

754
00:54:29,240 --> 00:54:33,920
It has been the epicenter of some of the most unforgivable sins that we as a nation have

755
00:54:33,920 --> 00:54:34,920
ever committed.

756
00:54:34,920 --> 00:54:39,440
A history that's stained as red as the clay on which it all lies.

757
00:54:39,440 --> 00:54:43,780
And unlike clay, the mistakes of our past will never wash out.

758
00:54:43,780 --> 00:54:49,600
They follow us as painful echoes from a faraway time that's somehow still too close to us.

759
00:54:49,600 --> 00:54:54,880
We can never unhear them, but maybe if we get enough race cars together in one place,

760
00:54:54,880 --> 00:54:56,560
we can drown them out.

761
00:54:56,560 --> 00:55:00,380
Even if it's just for a few hours at a time.

762
00:55:00,380 --> 00:55:07,140
The writer, the southern writer, William Faulkner once put it, between grief and nothing, I

763
00:55:07,140 --> 00:55:13,380
will take grief.

764
00:55:13,380 --> 00:55:16,300
People always ask me why I watch NASCAR.

765
00:55:16,300 --> 00:55:20,200
Why I enjoy something riddled with so many imperfections.

766
00:55:20,200 --> 00:55:24,820
And to that, I simply answer that we can design the perfect race car, but we can never

767
00:55:24,820 --> 00:55:27,460
design the perfect driver.

768
00:55:27,460 --> 00:55:32,340
Talladega may not be the greatest display of racing, but it is the greatest display

769
00:55:32,340 --> 00:55:33,340
of humanity.

770
00:55:33,340 --> 00:55:38,060
It's a racetrack where speed, skill and machinery no longer matter.

771
00:55:38,060 --> 00:55:43,060
It's a venue that only seems to grow more prosperous through its legacy of disaster.

772
00:55:43,060 --> 00:55:47,960
It's a battleground where the mistakes of the few are destined to end the journeys of

773
00:55:47,960 --> 00:55:49,060
the many.

774
00:55:49,060 --> 00:56:12,200
The only place in all of racing that produces no winners, only survivors.

775
00:56:12,200 --> 00:56:17,260
Every year on NASCAR's schedule, there are two dates that I never forget to tune in.

776
00:56:17,400 --> 00:56:22,440
When America's greatest drivers are confronted with the one track they fear most.

777
00:56:22,440 --> 00:56:28,320
In the land that America's native people once called home, 40 race cars are cursed to reenact

778
00:56:28,320 --> 00:56:29,320
their story.

779
00:56:29,320 --> 00:56:32,840
That must be at least 30 cars in that wreck.

780
00:56:32,840 --> 00:56:38,020
God help all of them because there's no place to go.

781
00:56:38,020 --> 00:56:42,960
The Seminole bided their time in the Everglades for more than 100 years.

782
00:56:42,960 --> 00:56:48,360
They emerged in an America that had grown rich off the lands they had claimed long ago.

783
00:56:48,360 --> 00:56:53,400
An America that was now looking to move on from its centuries long conquest.

784
00:56:53,400 --> 00:56:59,540
In 1957, the Seminole tribe was granted federal recognition by the US government, extending

785
00:56:59,540 --> 00:57:03,240
them special privileges as a sovereign jurisdiction.

786
00:57:03,240 --> 00:57:08,400
By the 1970s, the Seminole had begun using these privileges to host high stakes bingo

787
00:57:08,400 --> 00:57:13,280
halls which would go on to be the very first Indian casinos.

788
00:57:13,280 --> 00:57:18,680
While most of the Seminole tribe gradually integrated into modern society, a small part

789
00:57:18,680 --> 00:57:22,760
would continue their traditional way of life in the Everglades.

790
00:57:22,760 --> 00:57:27,320
This group would go on to form a new tribe known as the Miccosukee.

791
00:57:27,320 --> 00:57:32,600
In 2002, the Miccosukee tribe was looking to advertise their new casino and turn to

792
00:57:32,600 --> 00:57:35,040
the world of NASCAR.

793
00:57:35,240 --> 00:57:39,800
Seven years later, the Miccosukee car would be the centerpiece of the most unbelievable

794
00:57:39,800 --> 00:57:42,560
moment in Talladega history.

795
00:57:42,560 --> 00:57:45,580
It's April 26, 2009.

796
00:57:45,580 --> 00:57:48,960
Americans are reeling from the struggles of the Great Recession.

797
00:57:48,960 --> 00:57:54,480
And on this Sunday afternoon, a few of them turn on the NASCAR Cup Series race at Talladega

798
00:57:54,480 --> 00:57:57,240
hoping to witness something incredible.

799
00:57:57,240 --> 00:58:02,360
In this race, they see big pileups, close racing and bizarre oddities that only Talladega

800
00:58:02,360 --> 00:58:04,360
can seem to produce.

801
00:58:04,360 --> 00:58:09,000
With just two laps left, the audience sees something truly unprecedented.

802
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:14,480
The 99 car of Carl Edwards rockets into the lead and starts pulling away from the pack.

803
00:58:14,480 --> 00:58:20,640
He's being pushed by a car no one has paid any mind to all day, the Miccosukee car, driven

804
00:58:20,640 --> 00:58:23,200
by rookie Brad Keselowski.

805
00:58:23,200 --> 00:58:29,240
After seven years in the sport, the Miccosukee team has never won a Cup Series race.

806
00:58:29,240 --> 00:58:34,260
Their best opportunity to do so is now resting on the shoulders of a driver making just his

807
00:58:34,260 --> 00:58:36,460
fifth career start.

808
00:58:36,460 --> 00:58:40,900
Going into today, there's such long shots to win that odds makers didn't even bother

809
00:58:40,900 --> 00:58:42,140
listing them.

810
00:58:42,140 --> 00:58:47,820
However, with just one lap to go, the Miccosukee car has just one driver standing in its way

811
00:58:47,820 --> 00:58:49,140
of glory.

812
00:58:49,140 --> 00:58:53,900
The tandem are pursued by the Army and National Guard cars, but they're not going to catch

813
00:58:53,900 --> 00:58:54,900
him.

814
00:58:54,900 --> 00:58:57,820
Keselowski pushes Edwards to the home stretch.

815
00:58:57,820 --> 00:59:02,300
He looks high, then he looks low as Edwards swerves down to block.

816
00:59:02,340 --> 00:59:06,300
Keselowski is forced all the way down to the double yellow line.

817
00:59:06,300 --> 00:59:09,700
He thinks about what happened to Regan Smith the year prior.

818
00:59:09,700 --> 00:59:13,620
He knows that if he goes below that line, it's game over.

819
00:59:13,620 --> 00:59:17,820
The Miccosukee car has been forced as far down as it can possibly run.

820
00:59:17,820 --> 00:59:20,280
It can go no further.

821
00:59:20,280 --> 00:59:23,620
It has been given no choice but to stand its ground.

822
00:59:23,620 --> 00:59:25,260
Can Keselowski try to win it?

823
00:59:25,260 --> 00:59:27,980
I don't think he can step out until he waits till the lap goes.

824
00:59:27,980 --> 00:59:28,980
He's going to the side!

825
00:59:28,980 --> 00:59:29,980
Is Edwards going to the side?

826
00:59:29,980 --> 00:59:30,980
Oh no!

827
00:59:30,980 --> 00:59:31,980
He turns it!

828
00:59:32,660 --> 00:59:33,660
No!

829
00:59:33,660 --> 00:59:34,660
Oh no!

830
00:59:34,660 --> 00:59:36,660
And that destroyed the front end of Newman's car.

831
00:59:36,660 --> 00:59:37,660
No!

832
00:59:37,660 --> 00:59:40,660
Edwards will not make it to the flag.

833
00:59:40,660 --> 00:59:44,660
Brad Keselowski won this race.

834
00:59:44,660 --> 00:59:46,660
Carl Edwards' car destroyed.

835
00:59:46,660 --> 00:59:48,660
Not sure where Carl's going.

836
00:59:48,660 --> 00:59:52,660
Maybe he thinks if he runs across the start-finish line, it'll count.

837
00:59:52,660 --> 00:59:53,660
That's what he's doing.

838
00:59:53,660 --> 00:59:55,660
I want to finish the race.

839
00:59:55,660 --> 00:59:56,660
And he did.

840
00:59:56,660 --> 00:59:57,660
Yes, he did.

841
00:59:57,660 --> 00:59:58,660
To a standing ovation from the crowd.

842
00:59:58,660 --> 01:00:00,660
Shades of Ricky Bobby.

843
01:00:02,220 --> 01:00:06,780
The funny thing about NASCAR is that if you watch long enough, everything always comes

844
01:00:06,780 --> 01:00:08,780
full circle.

845
01:01:01,980 --> 01:01:04,060
you
