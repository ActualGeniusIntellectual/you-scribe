0	12360	So it's been three months since that is the plan died and YouTube is in dire need of a
12360	18080	meme review series. That doesn't suck! So I'm here today to debut a series that I call Minute Memes,
18080	22080	where instead of narrating off the Know Your Meme page in between a bunch of filler while
22080	26600	desperately trying to reach the 10-minute ad break threshold, I'm gonna straight-up tell you
26600	32760	if a meme is good in 60 seconds or less. I am the mouthpiece for your new opinion on memes and let
32760	38920	me just tell you all that my reviews aren't just opinions. They're 100% bona fide facts backed by
38920	44840	volumes of peer-reviewed scientific research conducted by me to determine which memes are
44840	50840	bold and brash and which memes belong in the trash. So make sure you take my words as seriously as
50840	57020	possible. I'm not making meme reviews. I'm making biblical commandments. I have a 420 IQ with a
57020	63200	PhD in Applied Memetics from the Meme Institute of Technology. I am the smartest meme man on the
63200	65120	internet and don't you question it!
