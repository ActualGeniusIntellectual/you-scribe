So it's been three months since that is the plan died and YouTube is in dire need of a

2
00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:18,080
meme review series. That doesn't suck! So I'm here today to debut a series that I call Minute Memes,

3
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:22,080
where instead of narrating off the Know Your Meme page in between a bunch of filler while

4
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:26,600
desperately trying to reach the 10-minute ad break threshold, I'm gonna straight-up tell you

5
00:00:26,600 --> 00:00:32,760
if a meme is good in 60 seconds or less. I am the mouthpiece for your new opinion on memes and let

6
00:00:32,760 --> 00:00:38,920
me just tell you all that my reviews aren't just opinions. They're 100% bona fide facts backed by

7
00:00:38,920 --> 00:00:44,840
volumes of peer-reviewed scientific research conducted by me to determine which memes are

8
00:00:44,840 --> 00:00:50,840
bold and brash and which memes belong in the trash. So make sure you take my words as seriously as

9
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:57,020
possible. I'm not making meme reviews. I'm making biblical commandments. I have a 420 IQ with a

10
00:00:57,020 --> 00:01:03,200
PhD in Applied Memetics from the Meme Institute of Technology. I am the smartest meme man on the

11
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:05,120
internet and don't you question it!
