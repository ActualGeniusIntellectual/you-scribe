00:00.000 --> 00:03.440
One of the greatest sports movies ever made is Moneyball,

00:03.440 --> 00:08.720
which is a bit odd considering the film hardly shows any actual sports being played.

00:08.720 --> 00:13.520
In fact, most of the runtime features people shuffling around in the dingy backrooms of an

00:13.520 --> 00:19.680
aging baseball stadium. You see, Moneyball is a film about analytics, a side of sports that not

00:19.680 --> 00:25.520
many fans tend to care about. Some would say that boiling down entire teams and athletes to a series

00:25.520 --> 00:31.680
of statistics removes a lot of the nuance from the game, and a lot of the magic too. But sometimes,

00:31.680 --> 00:37.120
when the stars align, numbers can tell us some of the most interesting stories that sports have to

00:37.120 --> 00:42.960
offer. Moneyball tells the story of the 2002 Oakland Athletics, who rose to the top of the

00:42.960 --> 00:48.400
majors despite having one of the lowest payrolls in the league. Using radical new analytical

00:48.400 --> 00:52.800
strategies, the A's would end up setting the longest winning streak in the history of the

00:52.800 --> 00:58.800
American League. Sometime during the midst of the streak, television cameras capture a fan holding

00:58.800 --> 01:05.280
a sign which I've always found to be absolutely fascinating. We may never lose again. It's just

01:05.280 --> 01:11.360
such an astoundingly brazen thing to say. A notion so preposterous that we almost can't admit it's

01:11.360 --> 01:16.400
true. One that really makes us question the difference between the improbable and the

01:16.400 --> 01:21.760
impossible. This phrase carries with it an unmistakable aura. In a way, it perfectly

01:21.760 --> 01:27.840
captures the indomitable hubris of man versus the uncaring limits of nature. Because while yes,

01:27.840 --> 01:33.760
it is possible for any given team to win every game for the rest of time, such a scenario would

01:33.760 --> 01:40.080
be so astronomically unlikely that it might as well only exist in our imaginations. But hey,

01:40.080 --> 01:45.920
when the mojo starts flowing and the winds start piling up, almost anyone can be led to believe

01:45.920 --> 01:52.400
that they just can't lose. To open the 2023 baseball season, the Tampa Bay Rays got off to

01:52.400 --> 01:58.480
a remarkable start, winning each of their first 11 games. Coincidentally, I happened to be in

01:58.480 --> 02:03.760
town during the streak, so I decided to pop into the next one for a chance at witnessing something

02:03.760 --> 02:10.240
historic. After a tense game, the Rays held on to extend their streak to 12. The next day they

02:10.240 --> 02:16.320
won again to tie the major league record for best ever start to a season. One game after that,

02:16.320 --> 02:22.880
with a chance to stand alone in the record books, the Rays lost, ending their winning streak at 13.

02:23.520 --> 02:29.360
Of course, even this all-time great start was less than 10% of the way to the theoretical perfect

02:29.360 --> 02:36.800
MLB season, which would require winning all 162 regular season games plus 11 or so playoff games.

02:36.800 --> 02:41.360
The greatest teams in the history of the majors could only manage to win about three out of every

02:41.360 --> 02:46.480
four contests, meaning that we probably won't witness an undefeated baseball season before

02:46.480 --> 02:52.080
the heat death of the universe. In the pursuit of perfection, each individual game is another

02:52.080 --> 02:56.800
potential point of failure, meaning that leagues with smaller schedules have better odds at

02:56.800 --> 03:03.200
producing the elusive perfect season. At just over a hundred games, the NBA season is considerably

03:03.200 --> 03:09.840
shorter than baseball's. The best record of any NBA team so far belongs to the 1996 Bulls,

03:09.840 --> 03:15.760
who defeated about nine out of every 10 opponents they faced. The English Premier League features

03:15.760 --> 03:22.400
just 38 matches in a season, bringing its competitors even closer to perfection. In 2018,

03:22.400 --> 03:29.360
Manchester City went undefeated in 36 out of 38 matches. A remarkable feat, but one which reveals

03:29.360 --> 03:35.120
a complication about what we consider to be perfect. Association football features a lot of

03:35.120 --> 03:42.000
draws, an outcome many would call less than ideal. In the hunt for the truly perfect season, it's not

03:42.000 --> 03:48.400
enough to just be undefeated. The road to perfectville must be paved through wins and wins alone.

03:48.400 --> 03:53.760
Unfortunately, the overwhelming likelihood of draws in football push any dreams of perfection

03:53.760 --> 03:58.560
hopelessly out of reach. For a team to have any realistic shot of running the gauntlet,

03:58.560 --> 04:04.720
they'd be far better off in a sport like football, where tie games are few and far between. Perhaps

04:04.720 --> 04:10.720
no other professional sport provides better odds at a perfect season than the NFL. Early iterations

04:10.720 --> 04:15.840
of the league featured just over a dozen games in a season. Teams were knocking on the door of

04:15.840 --> 04:22.720
perfection as far back as 1934, when the Chicago Bears took a 13-0 record into the championship

04:22.720 --> 04:27.920
game. Leading by 10 points heading into the fourth quarter, the Bears historic bid would

04:27.920 --> 04:33.440
be spoiled after the New York Giants scored 27 unanswered points to steal the victory.

04:33.440 --> 04:38.960
Just eight years later, the Bears once again took an undefeated record into the championship game

04:38.960 --> 04:45.360
before falling just short to another underdog opponent. After the 1942 season, it would take

04:45.360 --> 04:52.320
20 years before any other NFL team got as close to perfection. The 1962 Packers finished the year

04:52.320 --> 04:59.120
with a 14-1 record, their lone loss coming from a Thanksgiving Day game versus the Detroit Lions.

04:59.120 --> 05:04.480
By now, the NFL was poised to become one of the preeminent sporting leagues in America.

05:04.480 --> 05:11.120
In 1970, they merged with the rival AFL to truly expand their influence nationwide. The merger

05:11.120 --> 05:16.720
would usher in what many considered to be the NFL's modern era, finally setting the stage for

05:16.720 --> 05:25.840
the stars of our story. By this point, most NFL franchises had decades of history under their belt.

05:25.840 --> 05:32.720
The Miami Dolphins were not one of those teams. Founded in 1966 as an expansion franchise, the

05:32.720 --> 05:38.160
Dolphins were still very much the new kids on the block at the time of the merger. As is the case

05:38.160 --> 05:43.760
with most expansion teams, they had a rough first few seasons, but things would turn around following

05:43.840 --> 05:49.360
the arrival of head coach Don Shula. Under his tenure, the Dolphins quickly rose to the top of

05:49.360 --> 05:54.640
the standings, earning their first playoff berth in 1970 and advancing all the way to the Super

05:54.640 --> 06:00.880
Bowl in 1971. While Shula's squad would fall short to the Dallas Cowboys, they would enter the

06:00.880 --> 06:11.600
following season with a vengeance. The 1972 Dolphins rocketed out of the gates with a 4-0 record.

06:11.600 --> 06:16.880
Their sights set on returning to the Super Bowl. However, in just their fifth game, the young

06:16.880 --> 06:22.640
season was placed in immediate turmoil. Starting quarterback Bob Griese suffered a broken ankle,

06:22.640 --> 06:28.080
forcing him out of action for the foreseeable future. Ordinarily, the loss of any team's most

06:28.080 --> 06:32.880
important position player would be a virtual death sentence, but thanks to coach Shula's

06:32.880 --> 06:38.720
well-rounded roster construction, the Dolphins were able to carry on. Remarkably, the offense was able

06:38.720 --> 06:43.920
to maintain its production behind the strength of its rushing attack. Running backs Larry Zonka

06:43.920 --> 06:49.520
and Mercury Morris would finish the season as the first teammates to each rush for a thousand yards.

06:49.520 --> 06:55.040
Coupled with a surprisingly solid play of 38-year-old backup QB Earl Morrill, the Dolphins

06:55.040 --> 07:00.480
still managed to post the league's number one offense. Arguably more impressive, however, was the

07:00.480 --> 07:06.560
defense, which also finished as the best in the league. For coach Shula, the strategy was simple.

07:06.560 --> 07:11.440
Keep the game close with stingy defense and eventually overwhelm the opponent with steady

07:11.440 --> 07:16.560
offensive pressure. It was far from the most flashy strategy, but in sports you don't play

07:16.560 --> 07:23.120
to be flashy. You play to win. And boy, did the Dolphins win. Following a narrow victory versus

07:23.120 --> 07:28.080
the Bills, the Dolphins were able to dispatch every other team on the schedule, entering the

07:28.080 --> 07:34.320
postseason a perfect 14-0. But despite their white-hot momentum, the team still had plenty

07:34.320 --> 07:39.600
of doubters, with some claiming that they had feasted on weak competition. Regardless, any

07:39.600 --> 07:43.840
questions over the Dolphins' greatness would be answered in the playoffs, where they would have

07:43.840 --> 07:49.440
to face the best teams the league had to offer. Their first test would come against the 10-4

07:49.440 --> 07:54.080
Cleveland Browns. Despite forcing five interceptions out of the Browns' offense,

07:54.080 --> 07:58.880
the Dolphins found themselves trailing late in the fourth quarter. With their perfect season in

07:58.880 --> 08:04.800
jeopardy, the offense came in clutch, driving down the field and scoring the go-ahead touchdown.

08:04.800 --> 08:10.080
The winning play would come at the hands of an unexpected hero, third-string running back Jim

08:10.080 --> 08:15.600
Kick, who would emerge in the playoffs as the Dolphins' X-Factor. After holding off the Browns,

08:15.600 --> 08:20.160
the Dolphins had an even tougher challenge ahead of them, going on the road to face the

08:20.160 --> 08:26.320
Pittsburgh Steelers. Modern NFL fans may be confused as to how an undefeated team was not

08:26.320 --> 08:31.920
given home-field advantage, but back in the early 70s, playoff hosting was actually determined by

08:31.920 --> 08:37.120
an annual rotation, providing yet another unfortunate setback for the Dolphins. Rather

08:37.120 --> 08:42.000
than basking off the temperate shores of Miami Beach, they would have to venture into the frigid

08:42.000 --> 08:47.440
north in the dead of winter, an environment notorious for punishing warm-weather teams.

08:47.440 --> 08:52.960
However, in this regard, the Dolphins caught a huge break, playing their game on an unseasonably

08:52.960 --> 09:00.320
warm day. In many ways, the 1972 AFC Championship was a meeting between two teams of destiny.

09:00.320 --> 09:05.840
The Dolphins, in pursuit of perfection, and the Steelers, fresh off of one of the most improbable

09:05.840 --> 09:11.600
victories the sport had ever seen. Within a matter of hours, one of these fairy tales would come to a

09:11.600 --> 09:18.320
tragic end. After a low-scoring first half, the Dolphins once again fell behind late in the game.

09:18.320 --> 09:23.760
With the offense in desperate need of a spark, Coach Shula made an unexpected decision.

09:23.760 --> 09:29.440
Quarterback Earl Morrill was taken out of the game to make way for the return of Bob Griese.

09:29.440 --> 09:35.120
The change-up disrupted the Steelers' defensive game plan, leading to two quick Miami touchdowns,

09:35.120 --> 09:39.360
giving the Dolphins enough of a cushion to hold on for the rest of the game.

09:39.360 --> 09:43.520
And with that, the perfect season was just one win away.

09:48.320 --> 09:55.920
Awaiting the Dolphins in the Super Bowl were the Washington Redskins, who had just finished

09:55.920 --> 10:01.040
manhandling the defending champion, Dallas Cowboys. Although the Dolphins had overcome

10:01.040 --> 10:05.600
every opponent thus far, many were still skeptical that they could seal the deal.

10:05.600 --> 10:10.960
With some sportsbooks ranking Washington as the odds-on favorites, it's understandable why so

10:10.960 --> 10:15.600
many fans were hesitant to embrace what was happening. Betting on the Dolphins would have

10:15.600 --> 10:20.800
been betting on the unprecedented. Thus far in their brief history, the franchise had hardly

10:20.800 --> 10:26.240
done anything worth remembering. Most people around the country barely knew of their existence.

10:26.240 --> 10:31.440
But soon enough, that would all change. Because on that sunny January afternoon,

10:31.440 --> 10:35.920
the 1972 Dolphins would accomplish something unforgettable.

10:45.600 --> 10:57.440
Welcome to Perfectville, population one. In just their seventh year as a franchise,

10:57.440 --> 11:02.160
the Miami Dolphins achieved the most coveted feat in the 50-year history of the league.

11:02.160 --> 11:10.160
A final record of 17 wins, zero ties, and zero losses. The mythical win percentage of 1,000.

11:10.160 --> 11:14.800
From this point on, the NFL would never be the same. The Dolphins had proven that the

11:14.800 --> 11:20.320
perfect season was possible. And in capturing the Holy Grail, their role had suddenly shifted

11:20.320 --> 11:26.480
from pursuers to protectors. Now that one team had finally broken through to perfection,

11:26.480 --> 11:30.000
the entire sport was left to wonder who was going to get there next.

11:36.400 --> 11:44.000
And so the hunt was on. 32 teams, one destination. From that point forward, they were all chasing the

11:44.000 --> 11:50.160
72 Dolphins. It's somewhat fitting that the NFL's first perfect season happened to coincide with

11:50.160 --> 11:56.000
the rise of Led Zeppelin's hit song, Stairway to Heaven. Throughout 1972, the track had begun to

11:56.000 --> 12:00.960
dominate radio stations across the nation, providing a rather serendipitous soundtrack

12:00.960 --> 12:06.080
to the Dolphins' ascension into the history books. Stairway to Heaven was indeed an accurate

12:06.080 --> 12:11.120
description of the monumental task awaiting the rest of the league. From the start of the season,

12:11.120 --> 12:16.720
each win can be seen as another step closer to the promised land. The stairway is treacherous

12:16.720 --> 12:22.160
and unforgiving, with just one slip-up erasing all of your progress and sending you back to square

12:22.160 --> 12:28.480
one. Every team starts off the year undefeated, but after week one, at least half will be out of

12:28.480 --> 12:34.480
contention. By week two, only about a quarter remain alive. In a typical season, there's usually

12:34.480 --> 12:40.800
only one undefeated team left by around week five, less than halfway through the schedule. Football

12:40.800 --> 12:45.920
is very much governed by chance, with random factors such as weather and injuries providing

12:45.920 --> 12:52.080
substantial variance over long periods of time. On any given Sunday, it's not uncommon for even the

12:52.080 --> 12:58.160
most dominant teams to suffer the occasional fluke loss. Needless to say, replicating the perfect

12:58.160 --> 13:05.600
season would be no easy feat. For the rest of the 70s, few other teams even got close. The 1975

13:05.600 --> 13:11.280
Vikings got off to the best start at 10-0. The best overall season belonged to John Madden's

13:11.280 --> 13:17.680
Raiders, who lost just once during their 1976 championship run. Two years later, the NFL

13:17.680 --> 13:24.160
expanded their regular season from 14 to 16 games, pushing the perfect season just a bit further out

13:24.160 --> 13:29.840
of reach. While future attempts at perfection would be more difficult, succeeding would be even

13:29.840 --> 13:35.360
more impressive. The next perfect season would not just equal the 72 Dolphins, but surpassed

13:35.360 --> 13:41.840
them with a theoretical record of 19-0. After the schedule change, it took a while before another

13:41.840 --> 13:47.200
great run at perfection. The next team to truly challenge the Dolphins was, funnily enough,

13:47.200 --> 13:53.200
the Dolphins. But this iteration of the roster was quite different than the one from 1972.

13:53.200 --> 13:57.280
Rather than controlling games through their bruising defense and rushing attack,

13:57.280 --> 14:02.960
these new-look Dolphins found their success through the air. Because in 1984, the Dolphins

14:02.960 --> 14:08.560
didn't just have a good passing season, they didn't even have a great one. They had the best

14:08.560 --> 14:14.400
statistical passing season since the invention of the forward pass, and it was all made possible by

14:14.400 --> 14:21.200
a 23-year-old from Pittsburgh named Dan Marino. We are seeing another spectacular effort by Marino

14:21.200 --> 14:27.200
who fires. Touchdown! Marino, gunning deep, and Clayton is open for a touchdown. What a

14:27.200 --> 14:33.520
bazooka shot by Marino. One of the more incredible passes I have ever seen. Marino throws deep down

14:33.520 --> 14:39.920
field. It is caught by fire. Touchdown! Touchdown, Dolphins! In the entire history of the quarterback

14:39.920 --> 14:44.800
position, you can make the argument that Dan Marino was the most physically gifted passer

14:44.800 --> 14:50.160
the sport has ever seen. In the modern day game, players like Aaron Rodgers and Patrick Mahomes

14:50.160 --> 14:55.200
have provided quite the spectacle over their elite combination of arm strength and accuracy.

14:55.200 --> 15:00.400
Dan Marino's 1984 season represents what would happen if one of these guys hopped in a time

15:00.400 --> 15:05.920
machine and traveled 35 years into the past. Indeed, Marino resembled a quarterback of the

15:05.920 --> 15:11.200
distant future, with throwing mechanics so quick that television cameras could hardly keep up with

15:11.200 --> 15:16.480
them. In just his sophomore season, he would rewrite the record books for the position. Prior

15:16.480 --> 15:23.680
to 1984, the NFL season record for touchdown passes stood at 36. By season's end, Marino had

15:23.680 --> 15:30.240
pushed the record to 48. This was no incremental improvement. This was like the scene in 2001 A

15:30.240 --> 15:36.320
Space Odyssey that cuts from a bone to a spaceship. The numbers set during Marino's quantum leap would

15:36.320 --> 15:41.840
not be bested until long after he retired, and the players that eventually surpassed him did so

15:41.840 --> 15:47.200
under a ruleset that more heavily favored offensive production. Adjusted for ERA, Marino's

15:47.200 --> 15:53.680
1984 season has to go down as the most impressive in history. Naturally, it contributed to a lot of

15:53.680 --> 16:00.960
wins as well. The 84 Dolphins would be the first team since the 72 squad to reach the 11-0 mark.

16:00.960 --> 16:06.320
Unfortunately, their perfect season would come to an end just one week later after an overtime loss

16:06.320 --> 16:12.400
to the Chargers. They would finish the regular season with a 14-2 record, one win back of the

16:12.400 --> 16:19.200
San Francisco 49ers, who posted the NFL's first 15-1 season. The two teams would end up meeting

16:19.200 --> 16:25.680
in the Super Bowl, where San Francisco's superior defense kept Marino's arm in check. The 49ers

16:25.680 --> 16:31.280
handed the Dolphins a crushing defeat, and adding insult to injury, surpassed the win total of the

16:31.280 --> 16:37.600
72 team. Although the Niners fell just short of the perfect 19-0, they had proven that it was a

16:37.600 --> 16:42.960
lot closer than what many may have thought. Despite the sour end of the season, the future looked

16:42.960 --> 16:48.320
bright in Miami. Behind their veteran coach and transcendent young quarterback, it seemed like

16:48.320 --> 16:53.760
the sky was the limit. But this is the point where our story takes a turn for the strange.

16:53.760 --> 16:58.640
While Dolphin fans were looking into the future, they should have taken more time to savor the

16:58.640 --> 17:05.040
present. Because as of today, 1984 would mark the last season Shula, Marino, or the Dolphins

17:05.040 --> 17:11.920
franchise would ever reach the Super Bowl. 1984 would also mark the retirement of Bob Kuchenberg,

17:11.920 --> 17:18.720
the last active member of the 1972 roster. And with that, the NFL's first perfect team had entirely

17:18.720 --> 17:25.280
exited the sport, or so we thought. Looking back now, many are convinced that the 72 Dolphins never

17:25.280 --> 17:30.960
fully left. Over the years, a mysterious pattern has developed involving teams who get a little

17:30.960 --> 17:36.080
too close to perfection, one that began immediately after the 1984 season.

17:44.800 --> 17:49.440
After already surviving one threat to their legacy, the Dolphins would have to contend

17:49.440 --> 17:56.160
with an even greater one in 1985, a franchise that was no stranger to chasing perfection.

17:56.160 --> 18:02.240
50 years after their original undefeated run, the Chicago Bears had returned to finish the job.

18:02.240 --> 18:08.480
By December, they had shot out to a 12-0 record, anchored by the most feared defensive unit in NFL

18:08.480 --> 18:14.160
history. By this point, the Bears looked downright unstoppable, defeating their last three opponents

18:14.160 --> 18:20.880
by a combined score of 104-3. If any team was meant to finish the year with a perfect record,

18:20.880 --> 18:26.880
this was surely the one. But before they could do so, they would have to pay a visit to Miami to face

18:26.880 --> 18:31.920
the Dolphins on Monday Night Football. For the first time, the Dolphins had the opportunity to

18:31.920 --> 18:38.720
defend their own legacy. And with the prestige of the 72 team on the line, they went out and played ball.

18:44.160 --> 18:57.280
Touchdown. Moreno. Cooper. Davenport. Into the end zone easily.

19:00.640 --> 19:06.240
Moreno gets the pressure, but he gets it to Matt Moore. Hysteria here in the Orange Bowl.

19:07.120 --> 19:12.880
Against their last six opponents, the Bears' defense had only allowed a total of 29 points.

19:12.880 --> 19:18.560
On this night, the Dolphins had scored more than that by halftime. All season long, the Bears had

19:18.560 --> 19:23.360
snuffed out pretty much every quarterback they faced, but they had yet to face a quarterback like

19:23.360 --> 19:28.960
Moreno. The 46 defense relied on collapsing the line of scrimmage before the offense even had a

19:28.960 --> 19:34.480
chance to throw, but Moreno had such a quick release that he could consistently beat out the pressure.

19:34.480 --> 19:39.440
Despite how overpowered the scheme had been for the rest of the season, it had one critical

19:39.440 --> 19:44.960
weakness in its pass coverage, a weakness that Shula and Moreno exposed in front of the largest

19:44.960 --> 19:50.400
televised audience in Monday Night Football history. But by far the most influential audience

19:50.400 --> 19:55.680
of the night was the one live in attendance at the Orange Bowl, the venue responsible for much of the

19:55.680 --> 20:01.040
Dolphins' early success. Back in the day, it was well known as one of the loudest stadiums in the

20:01.040 --> 20:06.480
sport due to how close the bleachers were to the field. In football lore, there's a term known as

20:06.480 --> 20:12.720
the 12th man describing how a unified sea of fans can be just as powerful as an extra man on the

20:12.720 --> 20:18.240
field. On that night, the Dolphins faithful delivered what truly was their finest hour.

20:18.240 --> 20:23.520
During one sequence in the third quarter, they are going absolutely ballistic. The stadium is

20:23.520 --> 20:29.440
so deafening that the Bears offense can't even hear their own snap count. The partisan crowd

20:30.320 --> 20:34.160
noisy to the point that the Bears cannot hear their offensive signals.

20:34.960 --> 20:40.160
For a long time, the Dolphins were the only professional sports team in the entire state.

20:40.160 --> 20:45.520
Eight days a year, the Orange Bowl transformed from an ordinary ballpark to the pantheon of the

20:45.520 --> 20:51.200
Florida man. It goes without saying that strange things tend to happen here. No matter how good the

20:51.200 --> 20:56.960
Bears were, they never really stood a chance. It just wasn't their night. It's a good thing the

20:56.960 --> 21:01.920
Dolphins stopped them when they did because after this game, the Bears steamrolled everyone else for

21:01.920 --> 21:07.920
the rest of the season, winning the championship with a record of 18-1. While many fans were

21:07.920 --> 21:13.360
eager to see the two teams square off once more in the Super Bowl, the Dolphins never made it.

21:13.360 --> 21:17.840
The highly anticipated rematch would be thwarted by the New England Patriots,

21:17.840 --> 21:24.880
a team that will come up again later on in our story. After the 85 season, the quest for

21:24.880 --> 21:30.800
perfection died down for the rest of the decade. The 1990 season featured a unique scenario in

21:30.800 --> 21:37.120
which two teams reached the 10-0 mark. However, as if their fates were intertwined, both ended up

21:37.120 --> 21:43.200
losing the following week. After an 11-0 start by Washington the next season, the hunt died down

21:43.200 --> 21:49.040
again for many more years. Oddly enough, the Dolphins spent a couple more seasons as the last

21:49.040 --> 21:54.720
undefeated team, which was a testament to their winning culture at the time. However, after the

21:54.720 --> 22:01.920
1995 season, the organization would experience its biggest shake-up yet when Don Shula finally called

22:01.920 --> 22:08.800
it quits. He retired as the winningest coach in NFL history. By this point, Shula basically was the

22:08.800 --> 22:14.560
Dolphins. He had been there for every milestone the franchise had accomplished and his departure

22:14.560 --> 22:22.080
finally severed the link between the team's past and present. 1997 marked 25 years since the perfect

22:22.080 --> 22:28.880
season. Maybe it was finally time to let it go. The following year, it would once again be put to the test.

22:31.760 --> 22:38.000
The 1998 season was dominated by two juggernauts, starting with the defending champion Denver

22:38.000 --> 22:44.160
Broncos, who became the first team in a quarter century to reach 13-0. With just three games

22:44.160 --> 22:49.200
left in the regular season, the Broncos entered their next contest as two touchdown favorites

22:49.200 --> 22:55.520
versus the mediocre New York Giants. However, the Broncos offense sputtered all day and with less

22:55.520 --> 23:01.040
than a minute left, the Giants scored the game-winning touchdown to end Denver's bid of perfection.

23:01.040 --> 23:07.120
In the NFL, there's no such thing as a guaranteed win. Even the bottom feeders of the league must not

23:07.120 --> 23:13.040
be underestimated. The perfect season requires near flawless execution each and every week.

23:13.040 --> 23:18.640
Any complacency can be punished from the most unlikely of sources. It turns out the Broncos

23:18.640 --> 23:24.800
were not done being punished. After losing their perfect record, they had to travel to Miami to face

23:24.800 --> 23:30.800
Dan Marino on Monday Night Football. As was the case with the 85 Bears, the Dolphins handed the

23:30.800 --> 23:36.720
NFL's strongest team their worst loss of the season. Just six weeks later, the Broncos would

23:36.720 --> 23:42.560
return to the very same stadium and capture their second consecutive Super Bowl. It was almost like

23:42.560 --> 23:47.760
their loss to the Dolphins was some rite of passage, as if relinquishing part of their record

23:47.760 --> 23:53.600
helped appease the spirits of football past, granting them a safe voyage through the postseason.

23:53.600 --> 23:59.680
Denver's second loss left them with the second best record in the league behind the 15-1 Minnesota

23:59.680 --> 24:06.000
Vikings, a team that got closer than any other to the first 16-0 regular season. A three-point

24:06.000 --> 24:11.920
loss in week nine was the only thing keeping them out of the record books. Remarkably, the 98 Vikings

24:11.920 --> 24:17.280
were flirting with perfection in more ways than one. Their kicker Gary Anderson had not missed a

24:17.280 --> 24:23.360
field goal all year. Thus far in the entire history of the league, no kicker had ever achieved a

24:23.360 --> 24:28.880
perfectly accurate season. Thanks to Anderson's automatic leg, the Vikings looked to be on a

24:28.880 --> 24:34.960
collision course with the Broncos. However, when the team needed him most, with a trip to the Super

24:34.960 --> 24:41.680
Bowl on the line, he missed. The Vikings never made it to Miami. Some would say they had a little

24:41.680 --> 24:48.160
too much perfection to handle. The Dolphins record had survived yet again, and as the millennium came

24:48.160 --> 24:54.800
to a close, so too did the career of Dan Marino. He retired as the all-time leader in pretty much

24:54.800 --> 25:00.960
every passing stat imaginable, but despite all he accomplished, he was nonetheless haunted by his own

25:00.960 --> 25:06.480
imperfection. After all those years, the Dolphins front office could never surround Marino with a

25:06.480 --> 25:11.600
good enough supporting cast to compete for a championship. He walked away from the game as

25:11.600 --> 25:17.520
arguably the best player to never win a Super Bowl ring. It's fascinating to think that by the end of

25:17.520 --> 25:22.960
the 90s, the Dolphins franchise had showcased possibly the best coach and best quarterback in

25:22.960 --> 25:28.720
the history of the league, yet both were seemingly overshadowed by this increasingly distant record.

25:28.720 --> 25:34.480
The longer it stood, the more the legend around it grew. Around this time, a rumor began circulating

25:34.480 --> 25:40.080
that after every season's last unbeaten team loses its perfect record, the surviving members

25:40.080 --> 25:46.720
of the 72 Dolphins celebrate by toasting champagne. Their presence still loomed over the league like

25:46.720 --> 25:52.640
some sort of defined specter. It was like the game had progressed to the future, but this relic from

25:52.640 --> 25:58.640
the past would not allow itself to be left behind. As the years went on, the league-wide failure to

25:58.640 --> 26:04.160
replicate the perfect season only made teams want it more, and it wasn't long before the Dolphins'

26:04.160 --> 26:13.760
record was under siege once again. The 2000s would bring plenty of more challengers to the throne,

26:13.760 --> 26:20.560
starting with the 04 Steelers, who became just the fourth team to post a 15-1 regular season.

26:20.560 --> 26:25.840
Rookie quarterback Ben Roethlisberger led them on a 14-game winning streak to end the year.

26:25.840 --> 26:30.720
However, much like the 98 Vikings, the Steelers would fall short in the playoffs,

26:30.720 --> 26:35.840
suffering a convincing defeat to the Patriots. Despite Roethlisberger's impressive rookie

26:35.840 --> 26:41.120
campaign, much of the headlines throughout the season would be dominated by another quarterback.

26:41.120 --> 26:47.280
2004 was a breakout season for Peyton Manning, who became the first player to surpass Dan Marino's

26:47.280 --> 26:52.720
single-season touchdown record. The year after, he had his sights set on another record.

26:52.720 --> 26:58.480
The 2005 Colts looked like the team to beat all season long. Their high-powered passing attack

26:58.480 --> 27:04.400
carried them all the way to a 13-0 record. But just like the 98 Broncos, Manning and the Colts

27:04.400 --> 27:10.640
would lose their next two games, finishing the regular season at 14-2. However, unlike the

27:10.640 --> 27:16.160
Broncos, the Colts would not be blessed with playoff success. Despite being overwhelming

27:16.160 --> 27:22.080
championship favorites, their season would end in disastrous fashion. Down by just three points in

27:22.080 --> 27:28.080
the final seconds, the Colts needed to make a 46-yard field goal to tie the game. Lining up for

27:28.080 --> 27:33.680
the attempt was Mike VanderJagt, who by this point was the most accurate kicker in NFL history.

27:33.680 --> 27:39.120
Thus far in his playoff career, he hasn't missed a kick on the Colts' home turf. In any other

27:39.120 --> 27:44.000
circumstance, things would have probably turned out differently, but these Colts had challenged

27:44.000 --> 27:56.560
perfection and the Ghosts had unfinished business. Despite the brutal defeat, Manning and the Colts

27:56.560 --> 28:02.960
hadn't given up on chasing perfection. In 2006, they got off to a far more modest 9-0 start

28:02.960 --> 28:08.800
before losing four of their last seven games. Oddly enough, the added adversities seemed to work in

28:08.800 --> 28:13.680
their favor as this Colts team marched through the playoffs to score the city of Indianapolis

28:13.680 --> 28:19.200
their first Super Bowl victory. The championship seemed to corroborate a paradoxical trend among

28:19.200 --> 28:24.640
the NFL's contenders. For the past few years, teams with worse records were having better

28:24.640 --> 28:30.000
success in the playoffs. It was almost as if to give yourself better odds of winning the title,

28:30.000 --> 28:35.840
it was advantageous to lose more during the regular season. This idea would be revisited by

28:35.840 --> 28:42.000
the 2009 Colts, who found themselves with a third opportunity at a perfect season and to raise the

28:42.000 --> 28:48.800
stakes even higher. This time, they had company. 2009 was just the second season in recent history

28:48.800 --> 28:54.480
that saw two teams reach the 10-0 mark. The New Orleans Saints had joined the Colts in the pursuit

28:54.480 --> 29:02.080
of perfection and both teams just kept on winning. Their records climbed to 11-12, then 13-0 before

29:02.080 --> 29:08.560
the Saints finally conceded a defeat. Once again, the Colts stood unopposed as the last remaining

29:08.560 --> 29:13.920
perfect team. The following week, they looked poised to advance to 15-0 while leading the

29:13.920 --> 29:19.200
Jets late in the third quarter. It was then when coach Jim Caldwell did the unthinkable.

29:24.080 --> 29:30.160
Peyton Manning has his helmet on. For the first time all season, someone other than Peyton Manning

29:30.160 --> 29:34.960
will take the snap at quarterback for the Indianapolis Colts. The painter is the number

29:34.960 --> 29:42.240
two quarterback. Lost the football. It's loose. Inside the five-yard line, the Jets cover for the

29:42.240 --> 29:57.200
touchdown. After already securing home field advantage in the playoffs, the Colts decided to

29:57.200 --> 30:02.880
bench their starters for the remainder of the game. For the first and only time in league history,

30:02.880 --> 30:08.480
a team had intentionally sabotaged its own perfect season. The decision would prove highly

30:08.480 --> 30:13.920
controversial. The moment Peyton Manning was taken out of the game, the fans in attendance rained

30:13.920 --> 30:19.520
down thunderous boos. Many of them couldn't believe what they were watching. The Colts had rested

30:19.520 --> 30:24.880
their starters before, but never with a perfect season on the line. The coaching staff remained

30:24.880 --> 30:30.000
steadfast in their reasoning, saying that winning the championship was the ultimate goal and that

30:30.000 --> 30:35.200
preserving the health of their star players was imperative to that goal, even if it meant

30:35.200 --> 30:40.880
sacrificing a perfect record. At the end of the day, an undefeated season is theoretically

30:40.880 --> 30:46.800
insignificant. It doesn't offer any additional rewards or advantages versus any other champion.

30:46.800 --> 30:51.600
The objective of NFL football is to hoist the Lombardi Trophy at the end of the season,

30:51.600 --> 30:56.560
and however you manage to get there should be irrelevant. The perfect season is just bragging

30:56.560 --> 31:01.840
rights. It's a nice thing to have. An amusing little factoid for geeks on the internet to

31:01.840 --> 31:08.640
romanticize in the unknowable future. But beyond all that, does it really, truly matter? Well,

31:08.640 --> 31:13.200
to answer that question, you have to look no further than the expressions of the fans and

31:13.200 --> 31:18.800
players watching their run come to a bitter end. You can say what you want to justify what happened,

31:18.800 --> 31:24.480
but it clearly mattered to them. Six weeks later, the Colts would lose the Super Bowl,

31:24.480 --> 31:29.520
and their undefeated season was sacrificed for nothing. They were beaten by the Saints,

31:29.520 --> 31:35.360
who had surrendered their perfect record fair and square. Their season came to an end in Miami,

31:35.360 --> 31:40.080
meaning that the ghosts may have played a hand in it. Perhaps they didn't want to leave the Colts

31:40.080 --> 31:44.960
with any excuses to entertain the thought that they could have been perfect if they had simply

31:44.960 --> 31:51.040
chosen to. If a team was truly meant to be perfect, the results would be unmistakable.

31:51.040 --> 31:54.880
We cannot choose perfection any more than we can choose our destiny.

31:57.040 --> 32:03.120
And so, the Dolphins perfect season had survived its most competitive decade yet. Despite facing

32:03.120 --> 32:08.640
more challengers than ever, no other team could manage to top them. The next 10 years would see

32:08.640 --> 32:14.720
the pursuit of perfection slow down considerably. But they still produced a few worthy adversaries,

32:14.720 --> 32:20.880
the first of which were the 2011 Packers, who started the year 13-0 before being upset by the

32:21.280 --> 32:26.080
5-8 Chiefs. After the loss, the Packers followed in the footsteps of the Colts by

32:26.080 --> 32:31.760
resting their starters, a decision that, once again, backfired. After dominating all year

32:31.760 --> 32:37.120
with their historically great offense, the Packers' stars ran cold in the postseason.

32:37.120 --> 32:42.960
They earned the dubious distinction of becoming the first 15-1 team that failed to win a single

32:42.960 --> 32:49.680
playoff game. The 2015 season featured what remains to this day as the last great run at

32:49.680 --> 32:55.440
perfection. The Carolina Panthers got off to the rare 14-0 start before inexplicably

32:55.440 --> 33:01.840
falling to the Atlanta Falcons, a team they had beaten 38-0 just two weeks earlier. The Panthers

33:01.840 --> 33:06.560
would go on to the Super Bowl where they would lose to our old friend Peyton Manning. Although

33:06.560 --> 33:12.480
he never got his perfect season, he was able to retire on top. As for the Panthers, they only

33:12.480 --> 33:18.640
continued the futility of 15-1 teams in the postseason. As of today, they are the last NFL

33:18.640 --> 33:24.320
roster to finish the regular season with just one loss. Since then, no one else has really come

33:24.320 --> 33:30.880
close to the perfect season, and the legacy of the 72 Dolphins lives on. However, many of you

33:30.880 --> 33:35.840
watching have probably noticed that I haven't told the full story, and that's because I've been

33:35.840 --> 33:42.080
saving the best for last. Over all this time, many teams have tried and failed to replicate the

33:42.080 --> 33:50.000
perfect season, but there is one that got closer than any other. The market's in an itsy-bitsy

33:50.000 --> 33:55.280
little gully right now. It's like everybody said, okay that was crazy, let's just all calm down.

33:59.680 --> 34:05.280
By the mid-2000s, the Dolphins had fallen on hard times. For the past several years,

34:05.280 --> 34:10.720
South Florida had been battered by hurricanes, which only served to punctuate the gloomy outlook

34:10.720 --> 34:16.160
for the future of the organization. Ever since Marino and Shula retired, the Dolphins had

34:16.160 --> 34:21.040
struggled to find any quarterback or coach that had the makings of a worthy successor.

34:21.040 --> 34:27.120
Meanwhile, the franchise that had was their longtime divisional foes, the New England Patriots.

34:27.120 --> 34:32.000
As the Dolphins sunk into dysfunction and instability, the Patriots had assembled the most

34:32.000 --> 34:38.160
ferocious dynasty the league had ever known. This team was no ordinary juggernaut. It was far more

34:38.160 --> 34:44.080
diabolical than that. Facing the Patriots during this time was like staring down the Death Star.

34:44.080 --> 34:48.400
They were a team designed to crush the hopes and dreams of the rest of the league.

34:48.400 --> 34:55.760
And for Dolphins fans, no season felt more hopeless than 2007. In August of that year,

34:55.760 --> 35:02.000
the city of Miami began the process of demolishing the Orange Bowl. The Dolphins had relocated to a

35:02.000 --> 35:08.640
new stadium long ago, and the site had fallen into disrepair. Ever since the departure, the team was

35:08.640 --> 35:14.080
never really the same. It seemed like the franchise had left part of their heart and soul in that old

35:14.080 --> 35:19.680
venue. The Orange Bowl was still very much the spiritual center of the Miami Dolphins, especially

35:19.680 --> 35:26.160
the 1972 team. By erasing such a historic place, it's almost like they were asking for trouble.

35:26.160 --> 35:36.400
Applying the last lick from the Patriots, our final score 49-28, New England.

35:38.800 --> 35:43.920
Immediately after, the Dolphins got off to the most miserable start in franchise history.

35:43.920 --> 35:49.360
By the halfway point in the season, they had failed to win a single game. Their three best

35:49.360 --> 35:54.640
offensive players had suffered season-ending injuries, leaving their game plan in a disarray.

35:54.640 --> 35:59.680
The Dolphins had no other choice but to conduct their offense through quarterback Cleo Lemon,

35:59.680 --> 36:05.920
a player who never started another meaningful game before or since. To make matters even worse,

36:05.920 --> 36:11.680
their arch rivals were headed in the polar opposite direction. The 2007 Patriots were on

36:11.680 --> 36:16.480
track to become the greatest team in history, featuring the most disgustingly unfair

36:16.480 --> 36:21.840
amassment of talent that will likely ever exist on an NFL roster. At the center of it all was

36:21.840 --> 36:27.520
newcomer Randy Moss, a top five receiver of all time, teaming up with franchise cornerstone Tom

36:27.520 --> 36:33.120
Brady, the single greatest quarterback of all time. They didn't just start the year undefeated.

36:33.120 --> 36:38.480
No one even came close to defeating them. Plenty of other teams through the years have challenged

36:38.480 --> 36:44.080
perfection, but these Patriots were different. It wasn't enough to simply win. They had to do so

36:44.080 --> 36:49.680
with such extreme prejudice. Before long, it was clear that this team had only one destination in

36:49.680 --> 36:54.640
mind. A championship wasn't enough. They were aiming for something even greater.

36:58.160 --> 37:04.400
By December, the Patriots still hadn't lost, and the Dolphins still hadn't won. The sky was

37:04.400 --> 37:10.400
falling in Miami, and the ghosts were nowhere to be seen. For the Dolphins' faithful, the grim

37:10.400 --> 37:16.000
reality was starting to set in. Not only were the Patriots closing in on the ultimate triumph,

37:16.000 --> 37:19.920
but the Dolphins were on the verge of the ultimate humiliation.

37:19.920 --> 37:26.640
Since the advent of the 16-game schedule, no NFL team had ever gone winless. In a cruel twist of

37:26.640 --> 37:32.000
fate, the franchise renowned for the NFL's most prestigious achievement was now in danger of

37:32.000 --> 37:39.040
inheriting its most shameful. 0-16, the mark of the Banished Prince, a scar from which they could

37:39.040 --> 37:45.360
never recover. With just three games left to play, it was starting to look like destiny. At that

37:45.360 --> 37:55.520
point, they had precisely one opportunity to save themselves. Their next matchup came against the

37:55.520 --> 38:00.960
struggling Baltimore Ravens, by far the most winnable game remaining on the schedule. If the

38:00.960 --> 38:06.480
Dolphins can't pull out a victory here, they're not going to have another chance. After two quarters

38:06.480 --> 38:12.640
of offensive ineptitude, they enter the half trailing 13-3. In attendance for the halftime

38:12.640 --> 38:18.800
ceremony are the members of the 1972 team, who are being honored for the 35-year anniversary of

38:18.800 --> 38:24.480
their grand accomplishment. Their presence signals one of two things. Either the Dolphins have found

38:24.480 --> 38:30.960
their salvation, or this really is the end, and the ghosts are just here to say goodbye to the legacy

38:30.960 --> 38:36.640
they built all those years ago. Perhaps sensing the gravity of the situation, Miami's players

38:36.640 --> 38:42.080
emerged from the locker room with purpose. As the pride of the franchise rested on their shoulders,

38:42.080 --> 38:47.840
the Dolphins rallied back to tie the game, and eventually take the lead. All they had to do now

38:47.840 --> 38:54.000
was hold off the Ravens for two minutes. However, after a bad kickoff, Baltimore drove all the way

38:54.000 --> 38:59.680
down the field. In the final seconds, they get the ball just one foot away from the end zone,

38:59.680 --> 39:05.360
but rather than trying for the go-ahead touchdown, the Ravens elect to play it safe and kick a field

39:05.360 --> 39:11.600
goal, sending the game to overtime. Luck is not on the Dolphins' side as the Ravens get the ball

39:11.600 --> 39:17.520
first, forcing Miami's exhausted defense back on the field. Baltimore marches all the way into

39:17.520 --> 39:23.280
scoring position, where they can end the game with a 44-yard field goal. This season, the Dolphins

39:23.280 --> 39:29.280
have lost six games by just a three-point margin, and it's about to happen again. A series of

39:29.280 --> 39:34.160
individual bad breaks have now snowballed into the nightmare they currently inhabit.

39:34.160 --> 39:40.640
The stadium has fallen mostly silent. Deep down, everyone is expecting this kick to go in, including

39:40.640 --> 39:46.800
Dolphins color commentator Jim Mandich. He was there during the franchise's finest hour, and now

39:46.800 --> 39:53.040
he's arrived at its darkest. It's been a long season, and he's preparing to sink into the abyss.

39:53.040 --> 39:55.760
What happens next, though, springs him back to life.

39:56.560 --> 40:12.160
And just like that, the Dolphins have a chance. If the offense can just find any sort of magic,

40:12.160 --> 40:16.880
they can still come out of this thing in one piece. However, for a unit that has struggled

40:16.880 --> 40:24.000
mightily all season, the end zone feels so very far away. 35 years ago, the Dolphins were on their way

40:24.000 --> 40:29.520
to being immortalized in the record books. Now, these Dolphins are fighting for the right to be

40:29.520 --> 40:35.200
forgotten. Way back at the end of Super Bowl VII, embedded within their crowning achievement was

40:35.200 --> 40:41.040
another embarrassing episode that has been mostly lost to time. At the end of the game, kicker Gero

40:41.040 --> 40:45.760
Yapremian committed one of the most atrocious bloopers in the history of organized sports.

40:46.320 --> 40:52.000
It's fascinating to consider that the NFL's perfect team was somehow responsible for its single

40:52.000 --> 40:57.360
worst play. Maybe it was their gift to the universe to prove the age-old wisdom that no one

40:57.360 --> 41:04.080
is truly perfect. 35 years later, the universe would repay the favor. As for a single moment,

41:04.080 --> 41:07.520
the NFL's worst team was blessed with the perfect play.

41:22.000 --> 41:30.000
Unbelievable! Unbelievable! The Dolphins have done it! They have won this football!

41:30.000 --> 41:34.320
Take us out of the history book! We're not going in for that one, baby!

41:35.040 --> 41:40.160
The 07 Dolphins may have narrowly avoided catastrophe, but they weren't out of the woods

41:40.160 --> 41:45.440
yet. While they were spared from going down as the worst ever, their legacy was still very

41:45.440 --> 41:52.080
much in jeopardy. The following week, the 01 and 13 Dolphins traveled to Foxboro to face the 14 and

41:52.080 --> 41:57.840
0 Patriots. They entered the game as 22-point underdogs, one of the biggest point spreads in

41:57.840 --> 42:03.840
history. However, the Dolphins have overcome the odds before when it came to defending their honor.

42:03.840 --> 42:08.720
Could the worst version of the Dolphins really pull off the upset versus the best version of

42:08.720 --> 42:15.120
the Patriots? Well, as amusing as that may have been, even I have to admit that the idea was a

42:15.120 --> 42:21.680
little too far-fetched. And so, the Patriots were just one game away from the first undefeated

42:21.680 --> 42:27.760
regular season in the 16-game era. The only team left standing in their way was the 10 and 5 New

42:27.760 --> 42:33.280
York Giants. By this point, both teams had locked up their respective playoff spots, meaning that

42:33.280 --> 42:39.200
they each had the opportunity to rest their starters. However, understanding what was at stake,

42:39.200 --> 42:44.560
everyone showed up to play. For a moment, it looked like the Patriots had found their kryptonite

42:44.560 --> 42:50.240
as the Giants entered the fourth quarter with the lead. But Brady and Moss could not be stopped as

42:50.240 --> 42:56.960
the Patriots rallied back to win. They had arrived at the elusive 16 and 0, just three postseason

42:56.960 --> 43:02.480
victories away from perfection. Dolphins fans and the rest of the league held their breath as the

43:02.480 --> 43:09.040
Patriots inched closer and closer. The Jaguars put up a valiant effort but were ultimately no match.

43:09.040 --> 43:15.520
The fabled 17 and 0 record, which stood alone for so long, had been equaled. In the AFC

43:15.520 --> 43:21.440
Championship, the Chargers held the Pats offense to just 21 points, but it still wasn't enough to

43:21.440 --> 43:28.720
stop them. For the first time in NFL history, a team had reached 18 and 0. The 72 Dolphins had

43:28.720 --> 43:34.400
been surpassed. This Patriots team may have held nearly every single accolade the league kept track

43:34.400 --> 43:40.880
of, but they still weren't perfect. Awaiting them in Super Bowl 42 was their final opponent.

43:40.880 --> 43:46.320
In a twist no one saw coming, the only team left standing in their way was, once again,

43:46.320 --> 43:51.680
the New York Giants. It would be the first Super Bowl appearance for the other Manning brother.

43:51.680 --> 43:57.600
While Peyton could never quite find perfection, Eli could do the next best thing by preventing it.

43:57.600 --> 44:03.120
The Giants entered the game as one of the biggest underdogs in Super Bowl history. Nobody expected

44:03.120 --> 44:07.520
them to get there in the first place, and now that they did, they had to face what was already

44:07.520 --> 44:13.280
being crowned as the best team ever. But despite the overwhelming task in front of these Giants,

44:13.280 --> 44:19.040
they knew that the pressure was on the Patriots. After how far they'd come, this was a game they

44:19.040 --> 44:25.120
could not lose. Sometimes it pays to be the underdog. You have nothing to do but go out

44:25.120 --> 44:30.960
and shock the world. The game was a tense defensive struggle. For the first three quarters,

44:30.960 --> 44:37.120
the score remained deadlocked at 7-3. With just 10 minutes left, the Giants finally broke through

44:37.120 --> 44:42.320
to take the lead. It looked like the nerves were really getting to the Patriots, as they were on

44:42.320 --> 44:47.120
the verge of losing everything they had worked for. With their backs against the wall, Brady

44:47.120 --> 44:52.480
led a touchdown drive to retake the lead with less than three minutes to play. If the defense could

44:52.480 --> 44:58.400
stop the Giants from marching 83 yards down the field, then perfection was theirs. Thus far,

44:58.400 --> 45:03.520
the Patriots have experienced good fortune all season, but their luck was about to change,

45:03.520 --> 45:09.200
because after biding their time until the last possible opportunity, the ghosts had finally come

45:09.200 --> 45:15.360
out to play. Early in the drive, the Patriots have a chance to end the game by stopping the Giants on

45:15.360 --> 45:21.520
fourth and one. Running back Brandon Jacobs just barely converts, and the game continues. On the

45:21.520 --> 45:27.840
next play, Manning gets hammered by a defender, but he hangs on to the ball, and the game continues.

45:27.840 --> 45:33.520
The play after that, Manning misses badly on a throw, sending the ball straight towards defender

45:33.520 --> 45:40.240
Ahsante Samuel. The ball bounces off his fingertips, and the game continues. The Giants had now dodged

45:40.240 --> 45:46.080
a bullet on three consecutive plays, but it's the next one which turns this sequence from lucky

45:46.080 --> 45:52.240
to downright supernatural. Manning drops back to throw and is immediately smothered by the defense.

45:52.240 --> 45:57.200
Somehow he escapes. Eli heaves the ball towards receiver David Tyree,

45:57.200 --> 46:01.200
who after this game will never catch another pass for the rest of his career.

46:16.480 --> 46:21.200
What just transpired may have been the most unlikely series of events to ever happen in

46:21.200 --> 46:27.440
a single NFL play, and it occurred at the direct expense of a team 60 seconds away from a perfect

46:27.440 --> 46:32.640
season. In this moment, it finally dawned on the Patriots that after all this time,

46:32.640 --> 46:38.800
they weren't the team of destiny. Four plays later, the Giants scored the game-winning touchdown.

46:38.800 --> 46:43.600
Many considered a Giants victory to be unthinkable, but if you've been following along,

46:43.600 --> 46:48.000
you may have noticed that they've been doing this kind of thing since the very beginning.

46:48.080 --> 46:53.360
The final seconds of the game featured Tom Brady desperately chucking the ball downfield to Randy

46:53.360 --> 46:58.720
Moss, a play that had worked so many times for them during the season. This time, however,

46:58.720 --> 47:04.160
it just isn't meant to be. The Patriots had made it to the very doorstep of perfectville.

47:04.160 --> 47:10.240
They kept knocking and knocking, but no one was there to answer. The 2007 Patriots finished with

47:10.240 --> 47:16.160
an 18-1 record, choking away perfection in the final minute of the final game. They had come

47:16.160 --> 47:22.160
the closest of anybody and were therefore condemned to the very worst fate. Many years

47:22.160 --> 47:27.760
later, Tom Brady retired as by far the greatest quarterback to ever play the game. He ended up

47:27.760 --> 47:33.280
throwing for over a hundred thousand yards, an unfathomable amount. He played the most,

47:33.280 --> 47:39.280
did the most, and won the most. He was the absolute best athlete that anyone could have asked for,

47:39.280 --> 47:46.400
but he wasn't perfect. Since 1972, no one is.

47:57.440 --> 48:03.600
In the summer of 2013, the undefeated Dolphins received an unexpected invitation. President

48:03.600 --> 48:08.880
Obama had welcomed them to the White House. Ordinarily, this honor is reserved for reigning

48:08.880 --> 48:14.240
champions of American sports, but by this point the squad had become so legendary that it was

48:14.240 --> 48:20.160
worth the exception. In their time, the NFL just didn't matter as much as it does today,

48:20.160 --> 48:25.920
and the team never received a proper ovation. This was possibly because then President Richard

48:25.920 --> 48:32.400
Nixon, a Redskins fan, evidently didn't feel like celebrating. Despite the snub, the players never

48:32.400 --> 48:38.160
thought much of it. What's funny to consider is that the 72 Dolphins probably never realized just

48:38.160 --> 48:42.960
how big of a deal their accomplishment would end up being. It's fair to say that no other

48:42.960 --> 48:51.920
team in American sports has remained so relevant for so long. 2022 marked 50 years since the perfect

48:51.920 --> 48:59.760
season. By now, the NFL's 16-game era has come and gone with no team ever reaching the elusive 19-0.

48:59.760 --> 49:06.400
As of today, the bar to clear is now 20-0 after the league expanded its regular season to 17 games

49:06.400 --> 49:12.080
in 2021. And with talks of an 18-game schedule on the horizon, it's looking more and more

49:12.080 --> 49:18.640
improbable that anyone else can get to perfectville. And so the obvious question remains, will anyone

49:18.640 --> 49:24.400
ever break the Dolphins' record? However, I think the far more interesting question to be asked is

49:24.400 --> 49:30.480
whether we want to see it happen. When it aired, more viewers tuned into Super Bowl 42 than any

49:30.480 --> 49:36.880
other game in American history. People are fascinated by perfection. To witness it is akin to

49:36.880 --> 49:42.960
encountering a pristine oasis in a vast, barren wasteland. The human condition is defined by

49:42.960 --> 49:49.040
imperfection. Modern existence is utterly inundated with mediocrity and dysfunction. And while you may

49:49.040 --> 49:54.320
think this would only intensify our appetite for perfect things, it turns out that people seem to

49:54.320 --> 50:00.800
prefer the contrary. Because as the Patriots were closing in on 19 and 0, most of us were rooting

50:00.800 --> 50:06.320
for them to lose. The same is true whenever any team gets a little too far in the season without

50:06.320 --> 50:12.240
a defeat. In fact, preying on the downfall of the last undefeated team has become somewhat of an

50:12.240 --> 50:18.720
annual tradition. The NFL has already seen one perfect record. And for most fans, that's enough.

50:18.720 --> 50:23.120
It's been around for so long now that it's hard to imagine the game without it.

50:23.120 --> 50:28.240
So many illustrious teams have failed in their quest to reproduce it that any others pursuing

50:28.240 --> 50:34.960
it today just feel unworthy. But surely, after enough time passes, a new challenger is bound to

50:34.960 --> 50:41.040
come along and give the ghosts a run for their money. So far this season, the 2023 Dolphins won't

50:41.040 --> 50:46.640
finish the year perfect, but they did manage to make some history of their own. The ultra-rare

50:46.640 --> 50:52.960
70-point game, a milestone that no team had accomplished since the dark ages of the sport,

50:52.960 --> 50:57.760
a feat so alien to the modern football world that it doesn't look right on our present-day

50:57.760 --> 51:03.760
scoreboards. After all this time, the Dolphins still have the uncanny ability to captivate us

51:03.760 --> 51:09.360
by making numbers go up. At the end of the game, they had the opportunity to run up the score even

51:09.360 --> 51:15.920
higher and tie the all-time record of 73. However, while on the cusp of what could have been its most

51:15.920 --> 51:22.080
defining career achievement, coach Mike McDaniel ordered his team to stand down. When asked about

51:22.080 --> 51:29.760
it afterwards, he explained that it was a matter of karma. The modern NFL is more data-driven than

51:29.760 --> 51:35.600
ever before. Every measurable statistic is tracked and analyzed to give teams any sort of edge over

51:35.600 --> 51:41.680
the competition. McDaniel himself is considered one of the most brilliant strategic minds in the game,

51:41.680 --> 51:46.640
and yet plenty of the league's most important historic decisions are still governed by

51:46.640 --> 51:54.400
superstition. And that's called karma, and I'm trying to keep good karma with the Miami Dolphins.

51:55.040 --> 52:02.880
By now, everyone knows that bad things happen when you try to pass 72. Hi, I'm Don Shula. I like to

52:02.880 --> 52:08.720
watch movies. I've seen this next one quite a few times already, but you know something? I don't

52:08.720 --> 52:14.480
think I'll ever get tired of seeing you. They say that records are meant to be broken. It stands to

52:14.480 --> 52:20.240
reason that somewhere down the line, one fortunate team will eventually join the perfect Dolphins on

52:20.240 --> 52:26.480
the mountaintop. However, there is a realistic possibility that no one ever gets there again,

52:26.480 --> 52:31.040
and that the perfect season is that much more special than anyone could have imagined.

52:31.040 --> 52:36.640
If that's the case, then the 72 Dolphins may have stumbled upon something that defies everything we

52:36.640 --> 52:44.000
know about sports. They own a title that they may truly never lose again. The legend continues, and

52:44.000 --> 52:49.760
until anyone else can complete the journey up the stairway, the NFL's only perfect team will be

52:49.760 --> 52:56.800
waiting and watching. As the years go by, these select few men have nothing else to do but savor

52:56.800 --> 53:02.560
the moment. Many of them are no longer with us. It's entirely possible that their defining

53:02.560 --> 53:07.840
achievement will outlive them all. If there really is a team of ghosts haunting the league from the

53:07.840 --> 53:14.080
other side, it's just gonna keep getting stronger. Someday, not too long from now, they'll all be

53:14.080 --> 53:19.680
reunited for the final time, and when that happens, I hope they remember to bring champagne.

53:32.720 --> 53:38.960
We're always in control, and when you say Miami, you're talking Super Bowl, cause we're the

53:38.960 --> 53:48.400
Miami Dolphins, Miami Dolphins, Miami Dolphins number one. Yes, we're the Miami Dolphins,

53:48.400 --> 53:53.680
Miami Dolphins, Miami Dolphins number one.
