0	8000	People of YouTube, it is I, everyone's favorite YouTuber, Emperor Lemon, coming at you with another unscripted commentary.
8000	10500	And today we're going to talk about a bit of YouTube news.
10500	15500	Now, this isn't any breaking YouTuber films dead body in Japan news.
15500	16500	Not like that, no.
16500	22500	This news is about something that's slowly but surely been happening over the past six months.
22500	43000	Everyone who makes YouTube videos knows who PewDiePie is.
43000	44500	He's at the top.
44500	46000	He's the number one YouTuber.
46500	55000	I mean, once he took over the position from Smosh back in 2013, no one even got close to him for five years.
55000	59000	He was quite truly, completely uncontested.
59000	69000	And PewDiePie has kept that position as the number one uncontested YouTuber for so long that many of us have just grown to accept it as fact.
69000	73000	When you ask anyone who the number one YouTuber is, it's gotta be PewDiePie.
73000	81000	And of course I'm bringing all of this up because it appears that PewDiePie's reign as the number one YouTuber may actually finally be ending.
81000	89500	But like I said, he's been at the top for so long that it almost doesn't even feel real that a channel's actually getting up there and challenging him.
89500	96000	And the channel I'm talking about is a channel by the name of T-Series, which is basically just Indian Vivo.
96000	107500	If you just imagine the most popular American pop stars all merging into one channel that comes out with their music videos, that's basically what T-Series is for India.
107500	113000	And T-Series is rapidly gaining on PewDiePie. Like, their current growth rates aren't even close.
113000	119000	T-Series is projected to pass PewDiePie in just a few months, if not less.
119000	121000	And nothing's really gonna stop them.
121000	125000	So for the first time in five years, this looks like it's gonna be the end of PewDiePie's reign.
125000	132000	I mean, at first it was difficult for me to even imagine a version of YouTube where PewDiePie is not number one.
132000	137000	I guess PewDiePie's just been at the top for so long that we've all gotten so used to him in that position.
137000	148000	But then the more I thought about it, I began to realize that PewDiePie getting surpassed by T-Series is a really fitting situation for the current state of YouTube.
148000	154000	Because the era of YouTube that PewDiePie represents simply does not exist anymore.
154000	161000	The fact that he has even managed to stay on top for as long as he has is somewhat of a miracle.
161000	172000	So with that being said, I just really wanted to take this time to reflect on the extent that YouTube has changed since PewDiePie has been the number one YouTuber.
172000	186000	Well, the most obvious thing that comes to mind is that YouTube has practically gone corporate.
186000	193000	And that's not just YouTube itself, who to an extent has always kind of been making business deals behind the scenes.
193000	205000	I'm talking about the YouTubers. There are so many big channels with tens of millions of subscribers nowadays whose only purpose is to pander to nine-year-olds.
205000	217000	Nowadays it's all about trying to game the system to get as much revenue and as much watch time and as many views as you possibly can, regardless of the actual impression you make on your audience.
217000	225000	Right now it seems like the big business decision is just getting someone to put their eyes on your video, regardless of whether or not they enjoy it.
225000	231000	You see all these toy channels, all these obnoxious vloggers like the Paul Brothers.
231000	238000	It just seems like there's so many more of these guys now than there were back in 2013 when PewDiePie took over.
238000	245000	Right now it's not about being liked and respected, it's more how many kids can you get to click on your video and watch it like a zombie.
245000	250000	It's just that the business end of YouTube has so greatly expanded.
250000	262000	And moving forward, it seems like the number one priority for people starting their YouTube channels nowadays is about making money and branding and marketing themselves and their own merchandise.
262000	269000	And far less about being liked and respected and making genuinely substantive videos.
269000	276000	So that's basically the biggest glaring change that I can see has come across YouTube during the PewDiePie era.
276000	292000	And looking at PewDiePie's channel today versus how it started out when he was first getting popular, it brings up another very interesting change on YouTube and that's how practically the entire Let's Play genre was born and then died with PewDiePie.
292000	302000	I genuinely do not think that if he took a channel like PewDiePie and started uploading the exact same type of content that he did when he was working his way up the ranks,
302000	311000	I genuinely don't think a channel with exactly the same videos today would get even 100,000 subscribers.
311000	319000	When PewDiePie was uploading 10 minute Let's Plays, he really capitalized on an algorithm change that heavily favored that type of content.
319000	326000	And it's hard to think about it now, but back when PewDiePie was starting, a Let's Play was still a pretty fresh thing on YouTube.
326000	339000	It really wasn't done to such a wide extent until PewDiePie started getting popular and then everybody realized that, hey, I could just play a video game and talk over it and get a million subscribers.
339000	340000	It's that simple.
340000	353000	So it's interesting to think about how the whole Let's Play market got incredibly saturated and the whole wave of popularity that PewDiePie rode is basically completely unreplicable.
353000	361000	It will never happen again where someone just plays some video games, talks over it in a face cam, and gets popular on YouTube.
362000	368000	So I guess in summary, I'd say that Let's Plays kind of died on YouTube when the market got completely saturated.
368000	376000	And that's in addition to much of that same audience who originally watched Let's Plays on YouTube moving over to watch guys on Twitch and live streaming.
376000	380000	Because if you think about it, it's fundamentally the same type of content.
380000	383000	You're watching a guy play a video game and commentate over it.
383000	390000	But in a live stream as opposed to a YouTube video, you get to interact with a person in real time, so it's immediately more appealing.
390000	400000	So I just find it really interesting how PewDiePie just became so unbelievably popular on a genre of video that realistically no channel today could get popular off of.
400000	411000	I'd also like to point out that even beyond the genre of video that PewDiePie was making when he was getting popular, you could not even replicate the methods he was using in those videos.
411000	416000	Most importantly, we now live in a post-cursing age on YouTube.
416000	425000	A lot of people like to maintain this conception that PewDiePie got so much edgier as the years went on, but looking back at his videos, I'm not exactly sure that's true.
425000	434000	I would argue that as he was getting popular, many of his videos were very edgy in both the content of his language and the video games he played.
434000	442000	Now granted, it's possible for your videos to be edgy but not mature, which is how I would likely categorize PewDiePie's early work.
443000	448000	And also how I feel that he attracted such a large audience of young teens and children.
448000	458000	And as much as I would disagree with the principles behind YouTube restricting profanity on the website, I actually do think it's led to some somewhat positive consequences.
458000	466000	For one, in order to get popular these days, you have to be a lot more tactful than saying the word ass 700 times in a video.
466000	475000	YouTubers and general gaming channels have had to greatly improve their writing and rely a lot less on gimmicks and cursing in order to rise up the ranks.
475000	487000	I've actually observed a lot of gaming content on YouTube, sort of returning to how it was before PewDiePie got popular, back when guys like JonTron were the most popular gaming channels.
487000	495000	Where they would actually put a lot of writing and visual design into their content and wouldn't upload 30 minute chunks of gameplay every day.
495000	505000	Recently you've seen a big revival of that style of content. To me it's always been very interesting to see just how YouTubers adapt to major changes on the website.
505000	511000	And what type of content inevitably gets favored in whatever the current state of YouTube is.
511000	517000	One other thing I want to talk about is how the position PewDiePie is in as the most subscribed YouTuber.
517000	521000	Correct me if I'm wrong, but it used to feel so much more prestigious.
521000	527000	I mean back in 2011-2012, being the number one YouTuber on the site used to seem really important.
527000	533000	And it's odd how the quantity of subscribers that he has has gone up so much.
533000	538000	But it just feels like the prestige of having subscribers doesn't really matter all that much anymore.
538000	544000	I mean if you think about it, what's even the point of subscribing to anyone on YouTube anymore?
544000	549000	I think back when PewDiePie took over in 2013, the sub box was still functional back then.
549000	554000	I don't know, sometime between then and now YouTube broke it to where it doesn't really work all that well.
554000	557000	Gosh, subscribers used to matter so much more back then.
557000	560000	And now it's kind of just a formality.
560000	566000	It almost feels like being the most subscribed YouTuber doesn't really matter that much anymore because subscribers don't matter.
566000	571000	Pretty much 90-95% of the views you get on YouTube are from the algorithm.
571000	574000	How much your video is promoted to someone's homepage.
574000	576000	How much your video shows up on the sidebar.
576000	579000	How much your video gets auto played from other videos.
579000	587000	You also see so many channels out there with millions and millions of subscribers and they can't even break 50,000 views on a video.
587000	592000	It seems at this point that the subscriber count on YouTube is just a formality.
592000	597000	It's just a little score for you to hang your hat on and jack off your ego a little bit.
597000	601000	But functionally, it's basically worthless.
601000	604000	So that's another thing I think has definitely changed on YouTube.
604000	609000	Back when PewDiePie took over, the concept of having a lot of subscribers was so much more meaningful.
609000	617000	But I think ironically, one of the biggest things that's changed during PewDiePie's reign at the top of YouTube is PewDiePie.
617000	624000	A lot of people don't remember this, but when PewDiePie was first starting to get popular, he was hated.
624000	629000	For about a year, he was probably the most hated YouTuber on the platform.
629000	632000	He was like the Justin Bieber of YouTube.
632000	637000	He was hated for many of the reasons that people hate the Paul brothers today.
637000	641000	His videos seemed gimmicky and obnoxious.
641000	644000	He had an army of annoying fanboy children.
644000	649000	And it's really odd to think about that now, knowing the direction that PewDiePie's channel eventually turned.
649000	654000	At this point, you have to really look back and admire the balls that PewDiePie must have had.
654000	661000	To basically turn a 180 on being a kid-friendly, brand-friendly, family-friendly YouTuber to basically becoming a renegade.
661000	664000	I mean, PewDiePie used to be YouTube's golden boy.
664000	667000	He was the golden goose of the website, the face of everything.
667000	673000	Any official big ticket thing you'd see with YouTube, PewDiePie's face would always be on it.
673000	680000	And he gave up all of that just to simply allow himself to make videos that he enjoyed making.
680000	684000	And it's simply amazing how he turned his channel around like that.
684000	689000	And he's now one of the most respected, widely beloved people in this community,
689000	695000	where you'd be hard-pressed to find anyone these days who really still dislikes PewDiePie.
695000	701000	And I always found it so interesting that PewDiePie found himself in such a unique position,
701000	705000	where it seems like, at his highest point, he was bigger than YouTube itself.
705000	709000	And to an extent, he still is. I mean, everyone knows who PewDiePie is.
709000	717000	And even after he went rogue, and even after YouTube basically disowned him and cut him off from all of their branding,
717000	721000	and stopped recommending his videos to everyone on the website,
721000	728000	he was still largely able to coast off of his own name and his own popularity for so long.
728000	734000	And he's still kind of doing it today. But with that being said, he'll probably never be as popular as he once was,
734000	740000	simply because YouTube wants nothing to do with him these days, and they're never ever going to promote him again.
740000	746000	And for me, that's kind of the saddest thing about PewDiePie relinquishing his number one spot on YouTube.
746000	751000	It's because I don't see another guy like PewDiePie being the number one YouTuber ever again.
751000	756000	And it's going to be one of those things where people don't realize what they have until it's gone.
756000	764000	But for so long, PewDiePie was just kind of the perfect guy to have as the number one YouTuber, in my opinion.
764000	772000	And that is due to the simple fact that he's just a regular dude who got popular all by himself on YouTube.
772000	776000	Nobody knew who PewDiePie was before YouTube.
776000	783000	He wasn't a celebrity. He wasn't a pop star. He wasn't a global brand that everyone knows.
783000	792000	Ten years ago, PewDiePie was just a regular guy like you and me, and he became the most popular individual on this entire website.
792000	799000	And that's something that's so special and inspirational, and I don't think it can ever be replicated.
799000	804000	There will never be another channel like PewDiePie who becomes number one on YouTube.
804000	812000	I just don't see it happening. From now on, it's only going to be channels like T-Series, brands, corporations.
812000	818000	And that's not to generate any hate for channels like that. I mean, they're businesses. They're there to make money.
818000	823000	I can't fault them for seizing an opportunity that's there on a golden platter.
823000	831000	Four hundred million internet users in India and rising. They're simply fulfilling a market demand, and there's nothing really wrong with that.
831000	841000	But at the same time, I'm just going to miss the magical sort of feeling that PewDiePie, who's just a dude playing video games, managed to stay on top of the site for so long.
841000	848000	He managed to continuously have more subscribers than legit pop stars like Justin Bieber and Katy Perry.
848000	854000	He continuously managed to stay above the obnoxious, fake, asshole Hollywood vloggers.
854000	860000	He managed to be more popular than them without having to stoop to acting like an asshole.
860000	864000	He managed to break free from having to pander to nine-year-olds.
864000	871000	He actually got to be popular and respected and be loved just by being himself.
871000	880000	If you really think about it, would you really want anyone else representing YouTube? I can't really say that I'd prefer any of the other top 100 channels.
880000	887000	I guess technically even when he does get passed by T-Series, he would still be the number one subscribed individual on YouTube.
887000	902000	But it's just not the same. The fun of watching just this one dude beat out legit corporations and media conglomerates and pop stars and celebrities, it just won't mean as much with him as the number two YouTuber.
902000	911000	But at the same time, I couldn't really imagine it working out any differently, because the era of YouTube that PewDiePie represents no longer exists.
911000	914000	And I think it's finally time for all of us to move on.
914000	925000	It's just how it is I guess. So thank you. It means a lot. It really does. And stay awesome. I'll see you in the next video. Brofist.
944000	949000	Someone's trying to sell you something. No company would dare run a product placement on this channel.
