00:00.000 --> 00:22.680
Greetings everybody, it's ya boiii!

00:22.680 --> 00:24.960
Banished Goku 3000!

00:24.960 --> 00:27.660
The world renowned critic of all things anime.

00:27.660 --> 00:31.340
You know I'm legit because I have FOUR FUCKING NUMBERS IN MY USERNAME!

00:31.340 --> 00:35.820
So for the topic of today's video, we're gonna talk about ANIME.

00:35.820 --> 00:38.540
Boy is anime a shit.

00:38.540 --> 00:41.740
God, it's all just fucking terrible, and I hate it.

00:41.740 --> 00:43.340
And I hate YOU.

00:43.340 --> 00:46.140
I'M A MOTHER ANIME, YOU SHOULDN'T REVEAL ALL OF YOUR IDIOT IN THERE!

00:46.140 --> 00:51.660
But anyway, just because every anime sucks doesn't mean that every anime isn't also excellent.

00:51.660 --> 00:52.940
Man, do I love anime.

00:52.940 --> 00:54.620
Boy, anime sure is swell.

00:54.620 --> 01:01.900
So today, ladies and gentlemen, I present to you not a top 10, not a top 5, not a top 25,

01:01.900 --> 01:06.860
but a top 10 list on the greatest animes of all time.

01:06.860 --> 01:10.700
Now, this is usually the part of most videos like this where the YouTuber's like,

01:10.700 --> 01:13.660
Oh, don't get upset by this video.

01:13.660 --> 01:16.460
These are just my opinions.

01:16.460 --> 01:18.140
But I'm not gonna say that.

01:18.140 --> 01:20.460
BECAUSE I'M NOT A FUCKING PUSSY.

01:20.460 --> 01:24.460
Seriously though, if you disagree with the content of this video, well FUCK YEAH.

01:24.460 --> 01:27.180
My opinions are fucking better than yours.

01:27.180 --> 01:30.140
Just as they're better than any other human on this planet.

01:30.140 --> 01:32.620
I'M AN ANIMATION REVIEWER ON THE INTERNET.

01:32.620 --> 01:39.020
I didn't spend 12 years of my life studying animology at the top internet universities

01:39.020 --> 01:42.060
just for your butthurt child mouth to squeak at me.

01:42.060 --> 01:45.980
Oh, jeez, I don't really agree with this list.

01:45.980 --> 01:47.980
Suck a fucking dick, baguette.

01:47.980 --> 01:52.220
Anyway, uh, here's the top 10 best animes of all time.

01:52.220 --> 01:55.340
Number 10, Avatar Last Airbender.

01:55.340 --> 01:59.260
We start this list with the birthplace of all anime, China.

01:59.260 --> 02:00.940
Hey, China is still cool!

02:00.940 --> 02:07.740
Anyway, Avatar takes place in feudal China where our heroes must summon the power of all the elements.

02:07.740 --> 02:13.100
Fire, water, grass, electric, mountain dew, and purple.

02:13.100 --> 02:18.780
They must use their powers to protect the Na'vi people from the evil dictatorship of Mao Zedong.

02:18.780 --> 02:21.100
It's a pretty good show.

02:21.100 --> 02:24.940
Definitely one of the greatest animes of all time.

02:24.940 --> 02:27.820
Number 9, Steven Universe.

02:27.820 --> 02:28.780
Slow down, I'm gonna spurt.

02:30.780 --> 02:31.180
Sorry.

02:31.180 --> 02:36.780
Steven Universe takes place in feudal America where our heroes must summon the power of rocks.

02:39.500 --> 02:43.340
This anime features a light-hearted whimsical tone with playful dialogue

02:43.340 --> 02:45.660
when all of a sudden, holy shit, that got dark.

02:45.660 --> 02:50.700
Seriously though, watching the show is like walking out of Chuck E. Cheese's into the Holocaust Museum.

02:50.700 --> 02:53.820
You know, they say you shouldn't play with people's emotions,

02:53.820 --> 02:56.540
but that's a bold move on their part and I respect that.

02:57.500 --> 02:59.420
You don't know shit about my mother.

03:00.140 --> 03:00.780
Number 8.

03:01.420 --> 03:08.620
It seems today that all you see is Peter Griffin and Family Guy moments compilation.

03:08.620 --> 03:11.660
Hey guys, check out my Family Guy funny moments compilation.

03:11.660 --> 03:13.100
Give me a million views.

03:13.740 --> 03:16.380
Number 7, Hentai.

03:16.380 --> 03:22.940
Number 6, Dragon Ball P.

03:24.060 --> 03:24.940
What can I say?

03:24.940 --> 03:27.420
It's one of the greatest animes of all time.

03:27.980 --> 03:30.620
How can you not enjoy its memorable characters,

03:30.620 --> 03:34.540
amazing action sequences, great food, and brilliant animation?

03:34.540 --> 03:35.340
Number 5.

03:41.100 --> 03:43.740
Number 4, Toy Story.

03:43.820 --> 03:47.260
Toy Story is my most favoritest movie ever.

03:47.260 --> 03:49.580
Did I mention that I'm a 90s kid?

03:49.580 --> 03:54.300
Don't you ever hate on Toy Story because it's my childhood

03:54.300 --> 03:58.860
and my childhood is better than yours because I was born in 1998.

03:59.980 --> 04:04.700
Well, anyway, Toy Story gets a bonafide top 5 spot.

04:04.700 --> 04:06.940
Number 3, Weinfeld.

04:09.340 --> 04:12.300
Just a note here, I was gonna put Bee Movie in this spot

04:13.020 --> 04:18.380
because you just gotta put Jerry Seinfeld in the top 5 of any anime list,

04:18.380 --> 04:25.100
but I ran by the numbers again and it turns out that a Bee Movie is in fact not anime.

04:25.100 --> 04:27.660
I'll have you guys know that I take incredible care

04:27.660 --> 04:31.900
in making sure that my top 10 lists are as legitimate as possible.

04:31.900 --> 04:36.220
Anything that could even marginally de-legitimize the validity of this 100%

04:37.100 --> 04:41.900
USDA certified grade A for anime list is completely unacceptable.

04:42.300 --> 04:44.060
Which brings me to number 2.

04:47.900 --> 04:50.140
When you think of excellence in anime,

04:50.140 --> 04:53.020
Cory has got to be one of the first names that pops into your head.

04:53.020 --> 04:58.780
Never before has an anime been crafted with such exquisite animation, compelling characters,

04:58.780 --> 05:05.420
ingenious attention to detail, thrilling plot, and not to mention serving as the inspiration

05:05.420 --> 05:09.660
for one of the most innovative and groundbreaking video games of all time.

05:09.660 --> 05:15.340
But wait a minute, if Cory in the House isn't the best anime of all time, what is?

05:15.980 --> 05:20.460
Well, without further ado, the greatest anime of all time is...

05:23.420 --> 05:24.380
Are you ready?

05:25.020 --> 05:26.460
It's fucking Shrek!

05:26.460 --> 05:27.500
The fucking-

05:27.500 --> 05:29.820
How could it have been anything else?

05:29.820 --> 05:32.700
How could it have been anything else?

05:32.700 --> 05:33.980
Holy shit!

05:33.980 --> 05:35.900
Are you fucking shitting me?

05:35.900 --> 05:39.420
Do you literally think anything else would be number 1?

05:39.420 --> 05:40.300
Oh my god!

05:40.300 --> 05:41.340
You know what, ugh.

05:41.340 --> 05:41.820
Oh my god.

05:41.820 --> 05:42.940
Okay, that's the end.

05:42.940 --> 05:47.100
It's over, everyone.
