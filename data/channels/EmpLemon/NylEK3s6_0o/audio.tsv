0	22680	Greetings everybody, it's ya boiii!
22680	24960	Banished Goku 3000!
24960	27660	The world renowned critic of all things anime.
27660	31340	You know I'm legit because I have FOUR FUCKING NUMBERS IN MY USERNAME!
31340	35820	So for the topic of today's video, we're gonna talk about ANIME.
35820	38540	Boy is anime a shit.
38540	41740	God, it's all just fucking terrible, and I hate it.
41740	43340	And I hate YOU.
43340	46140	I'M A MOTHER ANIME, YOU SHOULDN'T REVEAL ALL OF YOUR IDIOT IN THERE!
46140	51660	But anyway, just because every anime sucks doesn't mean that every anime isn't also excellent.
51660	52940	Man, do I love anime.
52940	54620	Boy, anime sure is swell.
54620	61900	So today, ladies and gentlemen, I present to you not a top 10, not a top 5, not a top 25,
61900	66860	but a top 10 list on the greatest animes of all time.
66860	70700	Now, this is usually the part of most videos like this where the YouTuber's like,
70700	73660	Oh, don't get upset by this video.
73660	76460	These are just my opinions.
76460	78140	But I'm not gonna say that.
78140	80460	BECAUSE I'M NOT A FUCKING PUSSY.
80460	84460	Seriously though, if you disagree with the content of this video, well FUCK YEAH.
84460	87180	My opinions are fucking better than yours.
87180	90140	Just as they're better than any other human on this planet.
90140	92620	I'M AN ANIMATION REVIEWER ON THE INTERNET.
92620	99020	I didn't spend 12 years of my life studying animology at the top internet universities
99020	102060	just for your butthurt child mouth to squeak at me.
102060	105980	Oh, jeez, I don't really agree with this list.
105980	107980	Suck a fucking dick, baguette.
107980	112220	Anyway, uh, here's the top 10 best animes of all time.
112220	115340	Number 10, Avatar Last Airbender.
115340	119260	We start this list with the birthplace of all anime, China.
119260	120940	Hey, China is still cool!
120940	127740	Anyway, Avatar takes place in feudal China where our heroes must summon the power of all the elements.
127740	133100	Fire, water, grass, electric, mountain dew, and purple.
133100	138780	They must use their powers to protect the Na'vi people from the evil dictatorship of Mao Zedong.
138780	141100	It's a pretty good show.
141100	144940	Definitely one of the greatest animes of all time.
144940	147820	Number 9, Steven Universe.
147820	148780	Slow down, I'm gonna spurt.
150780	151180	Sorry.
151180	156780	Steven Universe takes place in feudal America where our heroes must summon the power of rocks.
159500	163340	This anime features a light-hearted whimsical tone with playful dialogue
163340	165660	when all of a sudden, holy shit, that got dark.
165660	170700	Seriously though, watching the show is like walking out of Chuck E. Cheese's into the Holocaust Museum.
170700	173820	You know, they say you shouldn't play with people's emotions,
173820	176540	but that's a bold move on their part and I respect that.
177500	179420	You don't know shit about my mother.
180140	180780	Number 8.
181420	188620	It seems today that all you see is Peter Griffin and Family Guy moments compilation.
188620	191660	Hey guys, check out my Family Guy funny moments compilation.
191660	193100	Give me a million views.
193740	196380	Number 7, Hentai.
196380	202940	Number 6, Dragon Ball P.
204060	204940	What can I say?
204940	207420	It's one of the greatest animes of all time.
207980	210620	How can you not enjoy its memorable characters,
210620	214540	amazing action sequences, great food, and brilliant animation?
214540	215340	Number 5.
221100	223740	Number 4, Toy Story.
223820	227260	Toy Story is my most favoritest movie ever.
227260	229580	Did I mention that I'm a 90s kid?
229580	234300	Don't you ever hate on Toy Story because it's my childhood
234300	238860	and my childhood is better than yours because I was born in 1998.
239980	244700	Well, anyway, Toy Story gets a bonafide top 5 spot.
244700	246940	Number 3, Weinfeld.
249340	252300	Just a note here, I was gonna put Bee Movie in this spot
253020	258380	because you just gotta put Jerry Seinfeld in the top 5 of any anime list,
258380	265100	but I ran by the numbers again and it turns out that a Bee Movie is in fact not anime.
265100	267660	I'll have you guys know that I take incredible care
267660	271900	in making sure that my top 10 lists are as legitimate as possible.
271900	276220	Anything that could even marginally de-legitimize the validity of this 100%
277100	281900	USDA certified grade A for anime list is completely unacceptable.
282300	284060	Which brings me to number 2.
287900	290140	When you think of excellence in anime,
290140	293020	Cory has got to be one of the first names that pops into your head.
293020	298780	Never before has an anime been crafted with such exquisite animation, compelling characters,
298780	305420	ingenious attention to detail, thrilling plot, and not to mention serving as the inspiration
305420	309660	for one of the most innovative and groundbreaking video games of all time.
309660	315340	But wait a minute, if Cory in the House isn't the best anime of all time, what is?
315980	320460	Well, without further ado, the greatest anime of all time is...
323420	324380	Are you ready?
325020	326460	It's fucking Shrek!
326460	327500	The fucking-
327500	329820	How could it have been anything else?
329820	332700	How could it have been anything else?
332700	333980	Holy shit!
333980	335900	Are you fucking shitting me?
335900	339420	Do you literally think anything else would be number 1?
339420	340300	Oh my god!
340300	341340	You know what, ugh.
341340	341820	Oh my god.
341820	342940	Okay, that's the end.
342940	347100	It's over, everyone.
