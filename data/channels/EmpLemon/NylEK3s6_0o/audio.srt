1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:22,680
Greetings everybody, it's ya boiii!

2
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:24,960
Banished Goku 3000!

3
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:27,660
The world renowned critic of all things anime.

4
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:31,340
You know I'm legit because I have FOUR FUCKING NUMBERS IN MY USERNAME!

5
00:00:31,340 --> 00:00:35,820
So for the topic of today's video, we're gonna talk about ANIME.

6
00:00:35,820 --> 00:00:38,540
Boy is anime a shit.

7
00:00:38,540 --> 00:00:41,740
God, it's all just fucking terrible, and I hate it.

8
00:00:41,740 --> 00:00:43,340
And I hate YOU.

9
00:00:43,340 --> 00:00:46,140
I'M A MOTHER ANIME, YOU SHOULDN'T REVEAL ALL OF YOUR IDIOT IN THERE!

10
00:00:46,140 --> 00:00:51,660
But anyway, just because every anime sucks doesn't mean that every anime isn't also excellent.

11
00:00:51,660 --> 00:00:52,940
Man, do I love anime.

12
00:00:52,940 --> 00:00:54,620
Boy, anime sure is swell.

13
00:00:54,620 --> 00:01:01,900
So today, ladies and gentlemen, I present to you not a top 10, not a top 5, not a top 25,

14
00:01:01,900 --> 00:01:06,860
but a top 10 list on the greatest animes of all time.

15
00:01:06,860 --> 00:01:10,700
Now, this is usually the part of most videos like this where the YouTuber's like,

16
00:01:10,700 --> 00:01:13,660
Oh, don't get upset by this video.

17
00:01:13,660 --> 00:01:16,460
These are just my opinions.

18
00:01:16,460 --> 00:01:18,140
But I'm not gonna say that.

19
00:01:18,140 --> 00:01:20,460
BECAUSE I'M NOT A FUCKING PUSSY.

20
00:01:20,460 --> 00:01:24,460
Seriously though, if you disagree with the content of this video, well FUCK YEAH.

21
00:01:24,460 --> 00:01:27,180
My opinions are fucking better than yours.

22
00:01:27,180 --> 00:01:30,140
Just as they're better than any other human on this planet.

23
00:01:30,140 --> 00:01:32,620
I'M AN ANIMATION REVIEWER ON THE INTERNET.

24
00:01:32,620 --> 00:01:39,020
I didn't spend 12 years of my life studying animology at the top internet universities

25
00:01:39,020 --> 00:01:42,060
just for your butthurt child mouth to squeak at me.

26
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:45,980
Oh, jeez, I don't really agree with this list.

27
00:01:45,980 --> 00:01:47,980
Suck a fucking dick, baguette.

28
00:01:47,980 --> 00:01:52,220
Anyway, uh, here's the top 10 best animes of all time.

29
00:01:52,220 --> 00:01:55,340
Number 10, Avatar Last Airbender.

30
00:01:55,340 --> 00:01:59,260
We start this list with the birthplace of all anime, China.

31
00:01:59,260 --> 00:02:00,940
Hey, China is still cool!

32
00:02:00,940 --> 00:02:07,740
Anyway, Avatar takes place in feudal China where our heroes must summon the power of all the elements.

33
00:02:07,740 --> 00:02:13,100
Fire, water, grass, electric, mountain dew, and purple.

34
00:02:13,100 --> 00:02:18,780
They must use their powers to protect the Na'vi people from the evil dictatorship of Mao Zedong.

35
00:02:18,780 --> 00:02:21,100
It's a pretty good show.

36
00:02:21,100 --> 00:02:24,940
Definitely one of the greatest animes of all time.

37
00:02:24,940 --> 00:02:27,820
Number 9, Steven Universe.

38
00:02:27,820 --> 00:02:28,780
Slow down, I'm gonna spurt.

39
00:02:30,780 --> 00:02:31,180
Sorry.

40
00:02:31,180 --> 00:02:36,780
Steven Universe takes place in feudal America where our heroes must summon the power of rocks.

41
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:43,340
This anime features a light-hearted whimsical tone with playful dialogue

42
00:02:43,340 --> 00:02:45,660
when all of a sudden, holy shit, that got dark.

43
00:02:45,660 --> 00:02:50,700
Seriously though, watching the show is like walking out of Chuck E. Cheese's into the Holocaust Museum.

44
00:02:50,700 --> 00:02:53,820
You know, they say you shouldn't play with people's emotions,

45
00:02:53,820 --> 00:02:56,540
but that's a bold move on their part and I respect that.

46
00:02:57,500 --> 00:02:59,420
You don't know shit about my mother.

47
00:03:00,140 --> 00:03:00,780
Number 8.

48
00:03:01,420 --> 00:03:08,620
It seems today that all you see is Peter Griffin and Family Guy moments compilation.

49
00:03:08,620 --> 00:03:11,660
Hey guys, check out my Family Guy funny moments compilation.

50
00:03:11,660 --> 00:03:13,100
Give me a million views.

51
00:03:13,740 --> 00:03:16,380
Number 7, Hentai.

52
00:03:16,380 --> 00:03:22,940
Number 6, Dragon Ball P.

53
00:03:24,060 --> 00:03:24,940
What can I say?

54
00:03:24,940 --> 00:03:27,420
It's one of the greatest animes of all time.

55
00:03:27,980 --> 00:03:30,620
How can you not enjoy its memorable characters,

56
00:03:30,620 --> 00:03:34,540
amazing action sequences, great food, and brilliant animation?

57
00:03:34,540 --> 00:03:35,340
Number 5.

58
00:03:41,100 --> 00:03:43,740
Number 4, Toy Story.

59
00:03:43,820 --> 00:03:47,260
Toy Story is my most favoritest movie ever.

60
00:03:47,260 --> 00:03:49,580
Did I mention that I'm a 90s kid?

61
00:03:49,580 --> 00:03:54,300
Don't you ever hate on Toy Story because it's my childhood

62
00:03:54,300 --> 00:03:58,860
and my childhood is better than yours because I was born in 1998.

63
00:03:59,980 --> 00:04:04,700
Well, anyway, Toy Story gets a bonafide top 5 spot.

64
00:04:04,700 --> 00:04:06,940
Number 3, Weinfeld.

65
00:04:09,340 --> 00:04:12,300
Just a note here, I was gonna put Bee Movie in this spot

66
00:04:13,020 --> 00:04:18,380
because you just gotta put Jerry Seinfeld in the top 5 of any anime list,

67
00:04:18,380 --> 00:04:25,100
but I ran by the numbers again and it turns out that a Bee Movie is in fact not anime.

68
00:04:25,100 --> 00:04:27,660
I'll have you guys know that I take incredible care

69
00:04:27,660 --> 00:04:31,900
in making sure that my top 10 lists are as legitimate as possible.

70
00:04:31,900 --> 00:04:36,220
Anything that could even marginally de-legitimize the validity of this 100%

71
00:04:37,100 --> 00:04:41,900
USDA certified grade A for anime list is completely unacceptable.

72
00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:44,060
Which brings me to number 2.

73
00:04:47,900 --> 00:04:50,140
When you think of excellence in anime,

74
00:04:50,140 --> 00:04:53,020
Cory has got to be one of the first names that pops into your head.

75
00:04:53,020 --> 00:04:58,780
Never before has an anime been crafted with such exquisite animation, compelling characters,

76
00:04:58,780 --> 00:05:05,420
ingenious attention to detail, thrilling plot, and not to mention serving as the inspiration

77
00:05:05,420 --> 00:05:09,660
for one of the most innovative and groundbreaking video games of all time.

78
00:05:09,660 --> 00:05:15,340
But wait a minute, if Cory in the House isn't the best anime of all time, what is?

79
00:05:15,980 --> 00:05:20,460
Well, without further ado, the greatest anime of all time is...

80
00:05:23,420 --> 00:05:24,380
Are you ready?

81
00:05:25,020 --> 00:05:26,460
It's fucking Shrek!

82
00:05:26,460 --> 00:05:27,500
The fucking-

83
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:29,820
How could it have been anything else?

84
00:05:29,820 --> 00:05:32,700
How could it have been anything else?

85
00:05:32,700 --> 00:05:33,980
Holy shit!

86
00:05:33,980 --> 00:05:35,900
Are you fucking shitting me?

87
00:05:35,900 --> 00:05:39,420
Do you literally think anything else would be number 1?

88
00:05:39,420 --> 00:05:40,300
Oh my god!

89
00:05:40,300 --> 00:05:41,340
You know what, ugh.

90
00:05:41,340 --> 00:05:41,820
Oh my god.

91
00:05:41,820 --> 00:05:42,940
Okay, that's the end.

92
00:05:42,940 --> 00:05:47,100
It's over, everyone.
