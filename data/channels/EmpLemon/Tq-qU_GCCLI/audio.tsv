11280	15360	Hey Meme Sauce, Emp here. Why are the Simpsons green?
16240	21280	The green Simpsons effect is a running gag on this channel where I take footage of the Simpsons and
21280	27760	hue shifted upwards approximately 44 degrees, transforming their familiar yellow into a somewhat
27760	34080	alien green. The joke began in a video from February 2016 in which I remixed a clip from
34080	40320	the episode Homer's Enemy. At the time, the Simpsons had just aired their 588th episode.
40320	46640	588 nanometers is the approximate wavelength of yellow light as seen by the human eye.
47520	53040	MDB is the internet's most popular film and television database and the place where people
53040	58720	from all around the world unite to rate everything a 7 out of 10. The Simpsons as a series has managed
58720	64880	to earn an 8.7 and a handful of its very best episodes have reached the fabled 9 category,
64880	71440	but out of nearly 700 total episodes and counting, just one sits definitively above all the rest.
72000	74800	The name of this episode is Homer's Enemy.
76880	82000	The Simpsons is the longest running primetime television series in the US and across three
82000	87520	decades of programming, no other episode is more provocative, polarizing, and profound.
87520	93200	It is the resounding conclusion to one of the greatest runs of any show ever. After this episode,
93200	99680	The Simpsons was never the same and come to think of it, neither were we. I've had to work hard every
99680	104880	day of my life and what do I have to show for it? And what do you have to show for your lifetime of
104960	110960	sloth and ignorance? Stay the hell away from me because from now on we're enemies.
112000	116960	It's impossible to appreciate the significance of Homer's Enemy without first understanding the
116960	123360	series that preceded it. The Simpsons is a show about many things, family, politics, religion,
123360	129600	but most importantly, The Simpsons is a show about America. There's a running gag in the series over
129600	135440	the specific location of The Simpsons' hometown. Springfield is one of the most common place names
135440	141040	in the US. You can find a town called Springfield in more than 30 states. So which of these
141040	146960	Springfields is home to TV's most iconic yellow family? The truth is it doesn't really matter what
146960	151920	part of the country The Simpsons call home. The series has intentionally kept clues about
151920	157760	Springfield's location inconsistent and contradictory. Springfield isn't in America as
157760	163680	much as it is America. The town represents an amalgamation of American culture, attitudes,
163680	169440	and institutions. It's a malleable template for the show to comment on society in the United States.
170000	174160	The true location of The Simpsons' home may forever remain an enigma,
174160	177040	but in a way, all of us live in Springfield.
177040	188560	Two hours away from Springfield, Oregon, a young Matt Groening is developing a passion for cartoons.
189280	195040	In 1972, he leaves his parents, Homer and Marge, to attend the progressive capital of the Pacific
195040	200480	Northwest, Evergreen State College. There, he would embark on the first steps in his journey
200480	205600	towards creating one of the most influential cultural contributions of the 20th century.
205600	209040	But before he could do that, Matt Groening had to enter hell.
217040	222400	Like many aspiring artists of the modern age, Matt Groening would spend much of his 20s languishing
222400	228320	away in California. While bouncing around between what he described as a series of lousy jobs,
228320	232880	Groening would document his frustrations in a self-titled comic book called Life in Hell.
233520	238160	The comic carried much of Groening's youthful cynicism and irreverence, and what started as
238160	242400	a set of photocopied drawings shared among friends quickly picked up steam throughout
242400	247200	LA's underground art scene. One day, Life in Hell would end up in the hands of television
247200	251920	producer James L. Brooks. Matt Groening may have started off California dreaming,
251920	254640	but his doodling was about to pay off big time.
254640	259200	This is FOX.
259200	264800	1987 would change the face of American television through the grand opening of the FOX network.
264800	269680	For nearly three decades, the big three networks had reigned supreme over the airwaves.
269680	273920	American television in the 80s was much like the culture that surrounded it.
273920	277120	Conservative, sanitized, and family-oriented,
277120	283520	primetime programming consisted mainly of sugary sitcoms with responsible and virtuous role models.
283520	288960	The big three networks at this time had one simple strategy, mass appeal. They strayed
288960	294720	away from programming that would risk alienating general audiences. Typically, this group included
294720	300160	children, parents, and the elderly. The FOX network had a different strategy in mind.
300160	302560	Their plan was to appeal to the other guys.
306320	311280	Generation X represented a group of Americans unlike any that came before them.
311280	316160	It was a generation who found themselves born into a very different America than the one afforded to
316160	321680	their parents. They grew up in a time when the president, America's most prestigious role model,
321680	326880	was forced to resign in shame after getting exposed as a corrupt scoundrel. They witnessed
326880	331760	the mighty and unbeatable U.S. military get humiliated through a fiasco in some part of
331760	336000	the world most of them couldn't even find on a map. By the time they reached adulthood,
336000	341360	they were met with a worst economy since the Great Depression, unthinkable environmental crises,
341360	346960	and the continued existential dread of nuclear annihilation. With all that said, it's not hard
346960	352160	to understand why many in Gen X had no choice but to view the world with ambivalence and apathy.
352720	357360	Television in the early 80s tried to maintain the illusion of America continuing to be the
357360	363280	shining city on a hill, but for those occupying lower ground, the realities of the country's flaws
363280	369520	were far too much to ignore. Fox became the first major network to specifically appeal to the Gen X
369520	375360	attitude of cynicism and irreverence. The very same themes featured in the works of Matt Groening.
375360	381440	In 1986, Groening got a call from James L. Brooks offering the opportunity of a lifetime.
381440	386400	The Fox network was looking for a cartoon segment to air on the debuting Tracy Ullman show.
386960	392160	Unwilling to give out the rights to life in hell, Groening conceived of a different premise,
392160	397680	a family based on himself, his parents, and his two younger sisters. The Simpsons entered the fray
397680	403200	among a long lineage of American television families, and soon, people would come to realize
403200	410720	that they were not at all like their predecessors. The Simpsons represented an honest portrayal of
410720	415760	dysfunction in the American household. Viewers were immediately drawn to the yellow family's
415760	420720	relatable drama, and the segment quickly became one of the most popular on Tracy Ullman.
420720	426320	By 1989, The Simpsons had become so popular that they were upgraded from segment to series,
426320	431040	and so began one of the most influential television programs in the history of American
431040	436320	entertainment. It's remarkable just how different The Simpsons was than anything else on television
436320	442160	at the time. It was edgy, subversive counterculture from an underground artist. The show was
442160	447520	experimental, avant-garde, and even postmodern at times. It was the first mainstream show to
447520	452720	repeatedly reference and parody other media, relying on the audience's own knowledge of
452720	458160	movies and TV for much of its humor. The show was free to determine its own creative direction
458160	464320	without network interference, a liberty that was virtually unheard of in 1989. Not to mention that
464320	469840	the series was animated, a genre that for the past two decades was exclusively associated with
469840	475680	children, toys, and breakfast cereal. The Simpsons broke so many molds that it's almost preposterous
475680	481040	to consider a show this brazen airing on network television in prime time. The series essentially
481040	485840	rebelled against all of mainstream television and ended up taking much of America with it.
485840	491440	Season one debuted to an audience of 30 million people, immediately cementing itself as Fox's
491440	496560	flagship series. The mischievous Bart Simpson became a cultural icon, one of the first
496560	501520	characters to truly appeal to the slacker mentality of the 90s. The character embodied
501520	507280	the overall spirit of the show, defiant, unapologetic, and anti-authority. The series was
507280	513120	simultaneously beloved and controversial. It was unafraid to challenge America's most revered
513120	519120	institutions. To make American families a lot more like the Waltons and a lot less like the Simpsons.
520000	523440	Hey, we're just like the Waltons. We're praying for an end to the depression too.
524080	529600	It's easy to imagine a TV show mocking the president now. It's all but cliche at this point,
529600	534880	but in 1992 it was almost unthinkable. Much to the chagrin of President Bush,
534880	539200	American TV families became much more like the Simpsons by the end of the decade.
540160	544160	These talking dinosaurs are more real than most real families on TV.
544160	548880	Eventually audiences ended up resonating more with the yellow cartoon family than many of the
548880	555040	others portrayed by real-life actors. The Simpsons didn't just challenge the status quo, it redefined
555040	560480	the status quo in its own image. And while it began its run as the anti-sitcom, the show would
560480	565680	eventually transform into something entirely different. Hello, I'm The Real Jims, some guy
565680	570560	who talks about The Simpsons on YouTube, and this is the history of The Simpsons Showrunners, seasons
570560	577920	one through seven. The first two seasons were run by a combination of Matt Groening, James L. Brooks,
577920	582960	and Sam Simon. Obviously these early years were very developmental, so all three of them brought
582960	588240	a skill set that would build the foundation of the show. Season one is well known for its rather
588240	593280	rough animation, although things improved significantly halfway through. The early years
593280	598080	were considerably more down to earth and character driven in terms of their plot and joke writing.
598080	602800	They loved doing fantasy sequences, but weren't about those fast-paced cutaway jokes or anything
602800	608800	yet. They kept things small, kept the focus on the family. However, Bart was the breakout star
608800	613360	and got a lot of the attention in these early years. Season two was more about the world
613360	617840	building, introducing tons of new characters and giving people like Skinner, Mr. Burns,
617840	622400	and Grandpa spotlights. These stories became slightly more topical and satirical,
622400	627120	and the characters watched more TV. You can see moments where things are getting a lot more wacky,
627120	630880	but by and large, these first two seasons were about telling these classy,
630880	636160	focused, character-driven stories with few gimmicks. For seasons three and four,
636160	641040	Al Jean and Mike Reese took over as showrunners. This was where the show became significantly more
641040	646000	referential and bouncy, so to speak. They weren't afraid to cut away to something else to do a quick
646000	651520	joke, or suddenly do these extremely elaborate homages. Maybe cut to the TV for some movie
651520	657040	parodies. We get more B-plots and converging storylines. There was a stronger Hollywood vibe
657040	662000	to this era. You'd get these big guest star extravaganzas like Homer at the Bat and Krusty
662000	667520	Gets Busted. Season three tried to keep one toe in the season two pond, take a more balanced
667520	672640	approach, whereas season four pushed the show in a more surreal direction. Although that might be
672640	678000	a symptom of more Homer-focused episodes. By season four, the balance between Homer and Bart
678000	683360	tilted much farther in Captain Wacky's direction. That being said, it never reached the point of
683360	688480	just being a meta-comedy. These punchy pop culture references were balanced by actual
688480	692960	character drama. It's not just a silly romp through Duff Gardens, it's also about Selma
692960	698080	wanting to have a baby, or that Lisa needs braces. Seasons three and four took these extremely
698080	702080	down-to-earth character storylines and told them in the most cuckoo bananas way possible.
702800	707600	Seasons five and six, helmed by new showrunner David Merkin, took the show in a bigger and
707600	713440	more high concept direction. I think big is the best descriptor of this era. You'd get Homer going
713440	718080	into space, Bart becoming famous, Springfield legalizing gambling, Lisa taking on the toy
718080	723120	industry, and that's just season five. Whereas season six concluded with Who Shot Mr. Burns,
723120	727440	and filled the rest of the season with mysteries, conspiracies, and life or death situations.
728000	733200	These seasons loved the big Springfield stories, loved finding excuses for the residents to devolve
733200	738560	into an angry mob. Their homage and parody game was still strong, sometimes evolving into full
738560	743680	length episode parodies. This was also the rise of screw the audience jokes, in which they
743680	749360	explicitly set up a fake punchline, and then do the exact opposite. The jokes became considerably
749360	754320	more subversive and sarcastic, constantly playing games with the audience. There's a higher sense
754320	758960	of self-awareness here. The audience has seen a lot of their tricks already, so they gotta
758960	765120	keep us guessing. Veteran writers Bill Oakley and Josh Weinstein took over the show in seasons seven
765120	770080	and eight. Season seven took the subversiveness and meta humor of the previous year, and applied
770080	774480	it to the types of stories from the early years. There was more of an emphasis to bring things
774480	779440	back to the family, tell these emotional character stories like Mother Simpson and Home Sweet Home
779440	784960	Diddly Dum Doodly. But it wasn't just a throwback, they took a more experimental approach. Let's do
784960	790720	an extremely mundane and observational simulation of George Bush. Now let's do a bunch of short
790720	796240	sketches and pulp fiction homages. Season seven loved experimenting with its characters, putting
796240	801200	them in these strange high concept situations and deconstructing who they actually are.
802240	807040	By now, it should be clear that the show had evolved into something far beyond a simple riff
807040	813680	on the 80s sitcom. But this isn't even close to its final form. In season eight, they pushed things even
813680	821840	further. Season eight of The Simpsons would mark the final run of the Oakley and Weinstein era.
821840	827200	Many consider it the last hurrah of The Simpsons Golden Age. But before their departure, the
827200	832640	showrunners were about to take the series to strange new places. Season eight features the
832640	838480	most ambitious and experimental episodes that The Simpsons has ever produced. It pushed the concepts
838480	843200	and characters within the show to their absolute limit. The episodes were perhaps the most
843200	849040	self-aware and meta in the history of the series. They didn't stop at just breaking the fourth wall.
849040	854400	At times, they deconstructed the television industry at large, and on one occasion, The
854400	860880	Simpsons went so far as to deconstruct itself. It is the most ambitious and high concept episode of
860880	866720	The Simpsons' most ambitious and high concept season. At long last, we have arrived at Homer's
866720	872080	Enemy. It's an episode that presents The Simpsons in their natural habitat, but with a single
872080	878320	addition. Frank Grimes was created not just as a foil for Homer, but as a foil to the series itself.
878800	885040	In many other settings, he would be a hero, but in Springfield, USA, there is no greater antagonist.
885600	890720	Grimes is a prime example of a sympathetic villain. His work ethic is admirable and his
890720	896160	struggle is relatable. With Frank Grimes, The Simpsons succeeded in making an antagonist so
896160	901040	compelling that he made the audience start to resent the protagonist. Grimes presents a
901040	905280	scathing critique of Homer Simpson, the flagship character of the series.
916560	922320	Homer's Enemy confronts the most confounding issue of our time, inequity. The character of
922320	928480	Frank Grimes was conceived to resemble actor William H. Macy, who often portrayed downtrodden
928480	934080	working-class roles. Grimes would end up being voiced by longtime Simpsons cast member Hank
934080	939680	Azaria, who delivered what is in all likelihood his greatest performance of the series. Azaria
939680	944960	described the performance as the most emotional and meticulous he had ever attempted. His goal
944960	950640	was to portray Grimes with a seething passion underneath a totally calm exterior, such as the
950640	955840	temperament of many working-class people today. Everyone knows what it's like to be treated
955840	961200	unfairly. It's one of the most frustrating experiences imaginable. When we contribute
961200	966960	to society we do so under the expectation that our effort will be rewarded. This doctrine is
966960	972480	the essence of the American Dream. What does it mean to be American?
972480	976800	It's a question that will remain forever contested depending on who you ask,
976800	982480	but in my humble opinion, the spirit of the United States is rooted in ambition and discontent.
983040	989360	Ambition creates discontent. The desire to change the status quo drives people to demand something
989360	994160	greater. It's what drives people to give up everything they ever knew and cross an ocean.
994160	998240	It's what drives people to overthrow the most powerful monarchy in the world.
998240	1003200	It's what drives people to venture into parts unknown in search of gold, oil and whatever else
1003200	1008240	that might make tomorrow a better day. The American frontier saw people risk everything
1008240	1014080	for the opportunity of prosperity and individual liberty. They operated under the simple ideal of
1014080	1018800	a man controlling his destiny through only his own passion and self-reliance.
1018800	1024080	Frank Grimes represents the classical American hero, the only problem being that he exists
1024080	1029600	in modern America, where the idyllic frontier has been all but replaced with catatonically
1029600	1035200	tapping away at a computer for 40 hours a week. In most aspects, the US is no longer the land
1035200	1040720	of opportunity as it was once regarded. Many Americans now experience disillusionment with
1040720	1045840	the American dream, believing that we are now subject to the same kind of tyrannical oligarchy
1045840	1050880	from which our forefathers originally fled. The only difference now is that we have run out of
1050880	1057120	oceans to cross. Frank Grimes not only witnesses his own efforts fail to improve his standing,
1057120	1061600	he witnesses Homer prosper from a lifetime of sloth and ignorance.
1061600	1066960	Homer's outcome reflects the American dream, but his actions reflect the antithesis.
1066960	1072640	The episode raises a serious question, one that potentially threatens our entire perception of the
1072640	1078480	series. If we believe in the simple principle that hard work deserves to be rewarded, then shouldn't
1078480	1086240	we resent Homer Simpson? Well, why do we like Homer Simpson? There's no denying that Homer is
1086240	1092000	a very flawed character. Simpsons writer John Schwartzwelder suggested that Homer may embody
1092000	1097600	all seven deadly sins. Many aspects of his character are quite unpleasant, if not downright
1097600	1104240	unflattering. At times, he is reckless, ignorant, impulsive, and over-emotional. He is the spitting
1104240	1109760	image of how people from other countries stereotype Americans. An overweight, lazy,
1109760	1115120	dim-witted consumer. You can call Homer many things, but one thing you can't call him is
1115120	1121760	pretentious. Homer Simpson is the real deal. He doesn't hide behind a sanctimonious persona.
1121760	1126400	The truth is that we like Homer because he represents all of us, whether we want to admit
1126400	1133200	it or not. In complete contrast to ambition and discontent, Homer embodies a totally opposite but
1133200	1139360	equally American ideal, laissez-faire. The attitude of letting the world around you run its own
1139360	1144800	course. Such is the essence of freedom and individual liberty. Only by relinquishing
1144800	1151280	control over others can we ensure our own agency to do as we please. Laissez-faire is most commonly
1151280	1156720	mentioned in economics as the key principle of capitalism, which, depending on who you ask,
1156720	1163200	is the cause of and solution to all of life's problems. Laissez-faire created Homer and it also
1163200	1169520	created Mr. Burns. Is true freedom even attainable if its unaltered state inevitably resurrects
1169520	1174880	tyranny? Pretty much every political belief system today exists to answer this question in
1174880	1180160	one way or another. Realizing that perpetual endlessness of political debate can easily
1180160	1186400	force us into a nihilistic outlook of society at large, but Homer Simpson may offer us a way out.
1186400	1189200	Something very zen about this episode, you know, it's Homer's
1189920	1195040	blind happiness, his ignorant bliss, that just gets him through, you know?
1195840	1201440	Despite his overwhelming flaws, Homer has managed to reach a state of modern day enlightenment.
1201440	1206240	His childlike ignorance has liberated him from the rat race and the cult of work.
1206240	1211200	He somehow exists in total harmony with the frustrations of 20th century life.
1211200	1215200	In a world where everything has become so nauseatingly complex,
1215200	1221520	Homer represents a return to simplicity. He goes to work, clocks in, and gets paid to do nothing.
1221520	1226560	He is essentially stealing from the most evil man in town and he doesn't even question it.
1226560	1234400	Homer, I don't use the word hero very often, but you are the greatest hero in American history.
1234400	1239760	If Grimes represents the classical American hero, then Homer may very well be the modern
1239760	1245520	American hero. Sometimes the best way to fight the system is not to rebel against the system,
1245520	1250320	but to exploit the system. Hey, you seem like a great guy, so I'll give you a little tip.
1250320	1255120	If you turn that security camera around, you can sleep and no one will ever know.
1255760	1261040	With a character like Homer, there's beauty and imperfection. Unlike an ideal father figure,
1261040	1266000	he doesn't always have all the right answers, but watching his misadventures provides us with
1266000	1270160	solace that for as much as we screw up, things can still wind up okay.
1285760	1290400	Not everyone can be like Homer. Not everyone should be like Grimes.
1290400	1293200	Society can only function with a good mix of both.
1293760	1298400	It's easy to feel sympathy for the plight of Frank Grimes, but at the end of the day,
1298400	1305280	Homer is not his enemy. Hating Homer is kind of like hating your dog. Sure, they may inconvenience
1305280	1310240	us, but that's just the price you pay for unconditional affection. With all the cruelty
1310240	1315840	in the modern world, it's about all you can ask for. At the end of the day, Homer has a heart of
1315840	1322320	gold, even if sometimes he has a hard time showing it. Where Grimes goes wrong is blaming Homer for
1322320	1333040	his own misfortune. Perhaps the best scene in the episode is Frank Grimes snapping at the sight of
1333040	1339920	the Simpsons' home. Realizing Homer's material wealth utterly destroys Grimes' outlook on life,
1339920	1345520	the sheer unfairness of the situation transforms his relationship with Homer from mild annoyance
1345520	1351760	to bitter hostility. Homer's enemy draws many parallels to Arthur Miller's death of a salesman,
1351760	1356560	one of the first high-profile works to truly question the ideals of the American dream.
1357120	1362000	Death of a Salesman's Willy Loman is a misfortunate, exhausted worker who measures his
1362000	1367600	life's worth through popularity and material wealth. He becomes so paralyzed by this idea
1367600	1373920	of success that he loses his grip on reality. Likewise is the story and fate of Frank Grimes,
1373920	1379840	who comes to resent Homer's popularity and material wealth. However, this perceived injustice
1379840	1386320	is ultimately an illusion stemming from Grimes' incongruent concept of success. Homer was never
1386320	1392640	wealthy because of his success, nor was he successful because of his wealth. Homer is where
1392640	1398400	he is because of the intrinsic value he places in the people and world around him. This theme is
1398400	1403360	accented by the B-plot of the episode, where Bart buys an abandoned factory that everyone else
1403360	1408000	thinks is worthless. If most of us bought a factory at auction, we would immediately become
1408080	1414000	consumed by thoughts of profit, value, maintenance, and renovation. When Bart buys a factory, the only
1414000	1419760	thing he thinks about is how he can use it as an extended playground. This premise is a microcosm
1419760	1425520	of how Homer is successful and Grimes is miserable. It is specifically referenced in the dinner scene
1425520	1433680	to punctuate this distinction. During his rant, Grimes doesn't care about who Bart is as a
1433680	1439680	person. He only bemoans the unfairness of his material possession. Contrast this response with
1439680	1445360	Homer reacting to Grimes' life story. I live in a single room above a bowling alley and below
1445360	1451360	another bowling alley. Wow. While Grimes complains about living between two bowling alleys,
1451360	1456400	Homer is impressed. I believe that referencing a bowling alley with this line was a deliberate
1456400	1461520	choice by the writers to remind the viewer of Homer's lost dream of working in a bowling alley,
1461520	1464800	a dream he chose to sacrifice for the good of his family.
1466880	1472400	Ultimately, status and material possessions do not determine our character. Our value as
1472400	1478240	individuals is dictated by how we act in our most challenging moments. When push comes to shove,
1478240	1484080	Homer chooses to be kind and forgiving, while Grimes chooses to be spiteful and vindictive.
1484080	1488240	I would die a happy man if I could prove to you that Homer Simpson has the intelligence of a
1488240	1494480	six-year-old. Frank Grimes' fatal flaw is spawned through his obsession with fairness. Unlike the
1494480	1499680	principle of freedom, fairness is not something that can be explicitly given or taken away.
1500320	1506640	It will always be fundamentally tied to randomness and chance. The sad reality is that life is
1506640	1512720	inherently unfair. There will always be someone more fortunate than you, but by that same token,
1512720	1517840	there will always be someone less fortunate than you. Tomorrow you could win the lottery and then
1517840	1523440	die from a lightning strike. Would that be fair? It's impossible to answer because both of those
1523440	1529680	events are entirely out of our control. They exist beyond the scope of our influence. Even in our
1529680	1535120	most systematic attempts to practice fairness, inequality always manages to slip through the
1535120	1541440	cracks. There is no such thing as an absolutely fair system. Someone will always be getting the
1541440	1547280	short end of the stick. By trying to sabotage and humiliate Homer according to what he thinks his
1547280	1552880	co-worker deserves, Frank Grimes is entering himself into an unwinnable battle. In the end,
1552880	1558800	his obsession with fairness ultimately drives him mad. The idea of rewarding a man as incompetent
1558800	1569520	as Homer Simpson is simply too much for him to bear. Homer's job as a safety inspector at the
1569520	1575360	nuclear power plant is one of the most iconic gags in the entire show. The premise of a buffoon being
1575360	1581360	responsible for preventing a reactor meltdown is as hilarious as it is dark. If you ask me,
1581360	1586480	however, the whole setup is a perfect metaphor for Homer's outlook towards the universe.
1586480	1591360	He exists in one of the most stressful environments possible, yet his only concerns rest
1591360	1597600	within his narrow slice of the world. Homer is destined to remain forever content, even if the
1597600	1607440	world melts down around him. There will never be an elegant, harmonious solution to all of
1607440	1613360	America's problems. A part of America will always be fighting, and another part will just sit back
1613360	1619440	and watch the fireworks. The engine of America is powered by turmoil. No matter how tough things
1619440	1634240	get, it just keeps on chugging ahead. The end of Homer's Enemy is one of the darkest moments of
1634240	1639760	the entire series. The audience is intended to laugh at Frank Grimes's epic meltdown,
1639760	1646080	but at the time, not everyone found it funny. When this came out, I really recall it made half the
1646080	1652240	audience very mad. The more recent generation loves this episode, but when it first came out,
1652240	1657280	a lot of people got very angry about it. Upon release, the episode stirred controversy among
1657280	1663040	the Simpsons faithful. The grisly ending polarized viewers who had actually grown attached to Homer's
1663040	1668560	Enemy. Frank Grimes was so persuasive that he successfully turned a part of the audience against
1668560	1673680	the face of the show. In just a single episode, the Simpsons introduced the most compelling
1673680	1679360	antagonist in the history of the series and then utterly dismantled him. They took the classical
1679360	1684800	American hero and lowered him in a casket among gregarious laughter. Looking back, one has to
1684800	1690080	wonder if the series was burying more than just Grimes at the end of this episode. The origin of
1690080	1697920	this episode was what if a guy seemingly from the real world had to come deal with Homer. The
1697920	1703200	original concept for the character of Frank Grimes was taking a normal hard-working man and placing
1703200	1708640	him in the satirical and often nonsensical cartoon town of Springfield. He was designed to be
1708640	1713920	categorically unlike any other character on the show. It's for this reason why many have since
1713920	1720560	labeled Grimes as one of the most unique characters in Simpsons history. Except, there is one other
1720560	1725840	character in the series lineage who does bear a striking resemblance to Grimes. A character who
1725840	1731520	on many occasions showed great envy, insecurity, and vindictiveness towards one of his peers.
1731520	1736880	The name of this character is Homer Simpson. You know, if you gave Ned Flanders a chance... Oh,
1736880	1740720	here we go again. Look, I don't care if Ned Flanders is the nicest guy in the world, he's a
1740720	1746720	jerk. In the beginning, Homer's enemy lived right next door to the Simpsons. Ned Flanders served the
1746720	1752880	role of Homer's original foil. He represented the idealized role model of traditional family sitcoms.
1753440	1758320	This era of the show featured a much more desperate and frustrated Homer, one who would go
1758320	1763600	through great lengths to try to measure up to the more wealthy and popular Flanders. Early plots of
1763600	1768320	the Simpsons were frequently driven by Homer's jealousy of Flanders' material possessions.
1768880	1774080	Beyond matters of wealth, Flanders highlighted Homer's inadequacies as a father. You were right
1774080	1780480	the first time! He's perfect! Perfect in every way! A major theme in the early seasons is Homer
1780480	1785120	learning to accept the imperfections of his family. The Simpsons may look dysfunctional
1785120	1790640	versus the picturesque and well-behaved Flanders, but that's okay, because the Simpsons don't have
1790640	1796160	to be the Flanders. This conflict effectively captured the original spirit of the show,
1796160	1801760	eventually culminating in the season 3 episode when Flanders failed. It's an episode that eerily
1801760	1807040	mirrors Homer's enemy, but with the roles reversed. Despite Flanders only showing Homer
1807040	1813840	hospitality and kindness, Homer still roots for his demise. For once, Homer actually gets his wish,
1813840	1818560	and only then does he realize that the ultimate triumph over his adversary hasn't made him any
1818560	1823360	more happy. Many fans of the show wonder what could have happened to the character of Frank
1823360	1828160	Grimes if he wasn't killed off after a single appearance. It turns out the answer may have
1828160	1830320	been hiding in plain sight all along.
1830320	1831760	Hey, you okay, Grimy?
1831760	1834480	I'm better than okay. I'm Homer Simpson!
1834480	1839520	Only by viewing Homer's Enemy through the totality of the series can we truly grasp the brilliance
1839520	1844480	of the episode. Homer's Enemy is not just a critique about the regression of the American
1844480	1850560	Dream, it is a testament to the progression of The Simpsons. When Homer encounters Frank Grimes,
1850560	1855920	he is essentially meeting an earlier version of himself. It could be said that the original vision
1855920	1861440	of The Simpsons was to confront the whimsical television landscape with a brutal dose of realism.
1861440	1868880	The sitcoms that I grew up with presented a sort of weird, zombified ideal of the American family,
1868880	1872480	and it didn't relate to anyone I knew in reality.
1873040	1877760	The show began with a series of grounded and unromantic stories designed to challenge
1877760	1881760	the establishment in place around them. What they never envisioned, however,
1881760	1887040	was becoming the establishment. By the late 90s, The Simpsons were larger than life.
1887040	1891120	They had become an American institution and a worldwide phenomenon.
1891120	1895120	The show had accomplished more than its creators could have possibly imagined.
1895120	1900240	The Simpsons always prided itself on being at the cutting edge of nuanced, subversive comedy.
1900240	1905040	They pioneered an entirely new genre of programming. Pioneers will always get a lot
1905040	1910000	of credit for whatever they discover. They take unthinkable risks at a time when the odds are
1910000	1915280	completely against their favor. However, every pioneer knows deep down that they will inevitably
1915280	1922080	be overtaken by their successors. After eight seasons and 175 episodes, The Simpsons were
1922080	1934720	running out of stories to tell. There comes a time in all of our lives when we want to go out
1934720	1940400	and change the world, to break free from the system. Eventually, though, life always catches
1940400	1946400	back up to us. Being like Frank Grimes is inherently unsustainable. Sometimes the only
1946400	1952160	option left is to be like Homer. Following the end of the eighth season, showrunners Bill Oakley
1952160	1956960	and Josh Weinstein departed to work on the ill-fated Mission Hill. Matt Groening was
1956960	1961760	all but checked out of The Simpsons at this point, focusing much of his attention on developing the
1961760	1967920	concept for his new series, Futurama. Starting with season nine, The Simpsons began what can
1967920	1978000	only be described as a long slow march to mediocrity. It's extraordinarily sad to still
1978000	1983200	see The Simpsons producing new episodes today. It's like watching a dominant athlete have all
1983200	1987760	their remarkable abilities stripped away through the march of time until they are no more special
1987760	1993360	than the rest of us. There's a reason why many all-time greats in pop culture also happen to die
1993360	1998720	young. We never get to witness them wither away into a shell of their former glory. The brilliance
1998720	2004080	of those first eight seasons now only amounts to a measly quarter of the show's entire lifespan.
2004080	2008560	The Simpsons has been on the air so long that YouTube videos complaining about the show's
2008560	2014560	decline have themselves become stale and cliche. What was once the epitome of media counterculture
2014560	2019280	is now owned by the epitome of the media establishment. Following Disney's acquisition
2019280	2025520	of Fox in 2019, The Simpsons featured in a series of uncanny animated bumpers welcoming their new
2025520	2031120	overlords. Considering the prior two decades of openly trashing the evil empire, it's hard to
2031120	2036560	believe that this was even the same show anymore. In all honesty, The Simpsons was never designed to
2036560	2042400	survive until the 21st century. The big media conglomerates just keep it around as a ceremonial
2042400	2048160	token to evoke nostalgia for better times. At this point, Homer Simpson has been relegated to a
2048160	2053120	figurehead akin to the likes of Mickey Mouse and the Queen of England. Like many other forms of
2053120	2057840	counterculture, The Simpsons ended up becoming the very thing they sought to destroy.
2057840	2060560	If I had a TV show, I'd run that supper into the ground.
2064640	2067760	Don't cry for me. I'm already dead.
2072400	2076640	The Simpsons may have fallen hard, but we only see it that way because its original
2076640	2081360	runs set the bar so high. Lots of people today have been amazed by The Simpsons'
2081360	2086480	remarkable ability to prophesize modern-day events in past episodes. The truth is that
2086480	2091600	for as wacky of a place Springfield is, it was entirely modeled off our reality.
2091600	2094880	As you know, we've inherited quite a budget crunch from President Trump.
2095440	2101040	America is still America, and certain patterns in history tend to repeat themselves. If anything,
2101040	2105840	The Simpsons predicting the future serves more as a testament to how tuned in the series was
2105840	2111440	to American culture at its peak. The satire of The Simpsons held up a mirror to our world.
2111440	2115760	It shouldn't be much of a surprise when some days we start mimicking the reflection.
2116320	2120640	It's unfortunate to consider how younger generations never had the opportunity to
2120640	2125520	experience The Simpsons at its creative and cultural peak. While the actual show has never
2125520	2130240	been less relevant, the spirit of the show has witnessed a rebirth through the rise of remix
2130240	2135040	culture on the internet. One could say that the fast-paced irreverent attitude of The Simpsons
2135040	2139840	perfectly foreshadowed interactions on the internet today. Much like a certain young
2139840	2145440	cartoonist from Oregon, a new generation of artists is now using The Simpsons as a springboard to break
2145440	2151360	into the cultural space. The life cycle of the show has now come full circle, going from parody
2151360	2157440	to parodied. So despite its descent into corporate mediocrity, it's at least comforting to realize
2157440	2162960	that The Simpsons is still contributing to culture in a meaningful way. One such contribution was
2162960	2168080	made by British underground street artist Banksy, whose brutally unflattering satirization of The
2168080	2173920	Simpsons was aired as part of a 2010 episode. Banksy once famously reflected on the concept
2173920	2179520	of the second death, when somebody speaks your name for the last time. It suggests that even
2179520	2184880	if we cease to exist in a physical sense, our legacy will continue to influence those who
2184880	2190400	follow us. Frank Grimes may have only lasted a single episode, but what he accomplished in those
2190400	2195520	few minutes of screen time was unforgettable. There comes a time for every long-running TV
2195520	2200400	series when they jump the shark. A moment when the creators realize that they have exhausted all of
2200400	2205920	their creative juices and have nowhere to go but down. So they release an episode so unabashedly
2205920	2211120	preposterous that it fundamentally undermines any immersion in the story, characters, and world
2211120	2217200	moving forward. With Homer's Enemy, The Simpsons jumped the shark, but in typical Simpsons fashion
2217200	2222560	they did so in the most brilliant and subversive way. They welcomed an age of mediocrity with the
2222560	2228480	show's final masterpiece. Homer's Enemy is a monument to a television empire at its absolute
2228480	2234480	peak. It pushes the original artistic vision of the series to its absolute conceptual limit.
2234480	2240000	In just 23 minutes of screen time, The Simpsons created something so intensely profound that we
2240000	2246000	still think about it more than 23 years later. After it aired, The Simpsons was never the same.
2246000	2250320	It didn't just change the show, it changed the way we looked at the show.
2250320	2255040	Homer's Enemy was an episode so high concept that it elevated the series from a source of
2255040	2260560	entertainment to a source of study. It entices the audience to dig deeper and think harder about the
2260560	2266320	show than they ever have before. Oftentimes the greatest art doesn't give us all the right answers,
2266320	2268320	it makes us ask the right questions.
2268320	2279040	The discussion continues. The great lengths we stray in search of our own interpretation of
2279040	2284400	Homer's Enemy gives us a wider appreciation of the series as a whole. A majority of Simpsons
2284400	2289920	episodes are not spectacular. Many of them are hard to even call entertaining, but we don't
2289920	2294640	remember the series for those episodes. When people think of The Simpsons, they think of an
2294640	2299760	incredible show. They think of a show that redefined comedy and satire. They think of a
2299760	2304720	show that pushed the boundaries of what was possible on television. They think of a show so
2304720	2310000	influential that every other show would eventually copy it in some way. The legacy of The Simpsons
2310000	2314960	has always been defined as a show that stood out from everything else around it. So to answer the
2314960	2319840	question, why are The Simpsons green, we may instead want to ask why The Simpsons are yellow.
2320400	2325440	So yellow skin, why? Because it looks like there's something wrong with your TV set.
2326000	2331440	Sometimes a small tweak in what we find familiar is all it takes to change our whole perspective.
2331440	2337040	The Simpsons made everyone stop to adjust their TV sets, but the picture within was never broken.
2337040	2342720	Everything else around it was. The Simpsons opened our eyes to the yellowness of the whole world.
2342720	2348640	After a while, we no longer questioned why The Simpsons were yellow, they simply were. It was
2348640	2354160	only then when for just one moment, the creators had nothing else to do but to make them green.
2354160	2359600	Homer's enemy is The Simpsons Magnum Opus, and there will never ever be another episode like it.
