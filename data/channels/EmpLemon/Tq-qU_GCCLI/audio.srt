Hey Meme Sauce, Emp here. Why are the Simpsons green?

3
00:00:16,240 --> 00:00:21,280
The green Simpsons effect is a running gag on this channel where I take footage of the Simpsons and

4
00:00:21,280 --> 00:00:27,760
hue shifted upwards approximately 44 degrees, transforming their familiar yellow into a somewhat

5
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:34,080
alien green. The joke began in a video from February 2016 in which I remixed a clip from

6
00:00:34,080 --> 00:00:40,320
the episode Homer's Enemy. At the time, the Simpsons had just aired their 588th episode.

7
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:46,640
588 nanometers is the approximate wavelength of yellow light as seen by the human eye.

8
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:53,040
MDB is the internet's most popular film and television database and the place where people

9
00:00:53,040 --> 00:00:58,720
from all around the world unite to rate everything a 7 out of 10. The Simpsons as a series has managed

10
00:00:58,720 --> 00:01:04,880
to earn an 8.7 and a handful of its very best episodes have reached the fabled 9 category,

11
00:01:04,880 --> 00:01:11,440
but out of nearly 700 total episodes and counting, just one sits definitively above all the rest.

12
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,800
The name of this episode is Homer's Enemy.

13
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:22,000
The Simpsons is the longest running primetime television series in the US and across three

14
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:27,520
decades of programming, no other episode is more provocative, polarizing, and profound.

15
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:33,200
It is the resounding conclusion to one of the greatest runs of any show ever. After this episode,

16
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:39,680
The Simpsons was never the same and come to think of it, neither were we. I've had to work hard every

17
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:44,880
day of my life and what do I have to show for it? And what do you have to show for your lifetime of

18
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:50,960
sloth and ignorance? Stay the hell away from me because from now on we're enemies.

19
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:56,960
It's impossible to appreciate the significance of Homer's Enemy without first understanding the

20
00:01:56,960 --> 00:02:03,360
series that preceded it. The Simpsons is a show about many things, family, politics, religion,

21
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:09,600
but most importantly, The Simpsons is a show about America. There's a running gag in the series over

22
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:15,440
the specific location of The Simpsons' hometown. Springfield is one of the most common place names

23
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:21,040
in the US. You can find a town called Springfield in more than 30 states. So which of these

24
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:26,960
Springfields is home to TV's most iconic yellow family? The truth is it doesn't really matter what

25
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:31,920
part of the country The Simpsons call home. The series has intentionally kept clues about

26
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:37,760
Springfield's location inconsistent and contradictory. Springfield isn't in America as

27
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:43,680
much as it is America. The town represents an amalgamation of American culture, attitudes,

28
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:49,440
and institutions. It's a malleable template for the show to comment on society in the United States.

29
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:54,160
The true location of The Simpsons' home may forever remain an enigma,

30
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:57,040
but in a way, all of us live in Springfield.

31
00:02:57,040 --> 00:03:08,560
Two hours away from Springfield, Oregon, a young Matt Groening is developing a passion for cartoons.

32
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:15,040
In 1972, he leaves his parents, Homer and Marge, to attend the progressive capital of the Pacific

33
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:20,480
Northwest, Evergreen State College. There, he would embark on the first steps in his journey

34
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:25,600
towards creating one of the most influential cultural contributions of the 20th century.

35
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:29,040
But before he could do that, Matt Groening had to enter hell.

36
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:42,400
Like many aspiring artists of the modern age, Matt Groening would spend much of his 20s languishing

37
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:48,320
away in California. While bouncing around between what he described as a series of lousy jobs,

38
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:52,880
Groening would document his frustrations in a self-titled comic book called Life in Hell.

39
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:58,160
The comic carried much of Groening's youthful cynicism and irreverence, and what started as

40
00:03:58,160 --> 00:04:02,400
a set of photocopied drawings shared among friends quickly picked up steam throughout

41
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:07,200
LA's underground art scene. One day, Life in Hell would end up in the hands of television

42
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:11,920
producer James L. Brooks. Matt Groening may have started off California dreaming,

43
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:14,640
but his doodling was about to pay off big time.

44
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:19,200
This is FOX.

45
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:24,800
1987 would change the face of American television through the grand opening of the FOX network.

46
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:29,680
For nearly three decades, the big three networks had reigned supreme over the airwaves.

47
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:33,920
American television in the 80s was much like the culture that surrounded it.

48
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:37,120
Conservative, sanitized, and family-oriented,

49
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:43,520
primetime programming consisted mainly of sugary sitcoms with responsible and virtuous role models.

50
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:48,960
The big three networks at this time had one simple strategy, mass appeal. They strayed

51
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:54,720
away from programming that would risk alienating general audiences. Typically, this group included

52
00:04:54,720 --> 00:05:00,160
children, parents, and the elderly. The FOX network had a different strategy in mind.

53
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:02,560
Their plan was to appeal to the other guys.

54
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:11,280
Generation X represented a group of Americans unlike any that came before them.

55
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:16,160
It was a generation who found themselves born into a very different America than the one afforded to

56
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:21,680
their parents. They grew up in a time when the president, America's most prestigious role model,

57
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:26,880
was forced to resign in shame after getting exposed as a corrupt scoundrel. They witnessed

58
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:31,760
the mighty and unbeatable U.S. military get humiliated through a fiasco in some part of

59
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:36,000
the world most of them couldn't even find on a map. By the time they reached adulthood,

60
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:41,360
they were met with a worst economy since the Great Depression, unthinkable environmental crises,

61
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:46,960
and the continued existential dread of nuclear annihilation. With all that said, it's not hard

62
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:52,160
to understand why many in Gen X had no choice but to view the world with ambivalence and apathy.

63
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:57,360
Television in the early 80s tried to maintain the illusion of America continuing to be the

64
00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:03,280
shining city on a hill, but for those occupying lower ground, the realities of the country's flaws

65
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:09,520
were far too much to ignore. Fox became the first major network to specifically appeal to the Gen X

66
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:15,360
attitude of cynicism and irreverence. The very same themes featured in the works of Matt Groening.

67
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:21,440
In 1986, Groening got a call from James L. Brooks offering the opportunity of a lifetime.

68
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:26,400
The Fox network was looking for a cartoon segment to air on the debuting Tracy Ullman show.

69
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:32,160
Unwilling to give out the rights to life in hell, Groening conceived of a different premise,

70
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:37,680
a family based on himself, his parents, and his two younger sisters. The Simpsons entered the fray

71
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:43,200
among a long lineage of American television families, and soon, people would come to realize

72
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:50,720
that they were not at all like their predecessors. The Simpsons represented an honest portrayal of

73
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:55,760
dysfunction in the American household. Viewers were immediately drawn to the yellow family's

74
00:06:55,760 --> 00:07:00,720
relatable drama, and the segment quickly became one of the most popular on Tracy Ullman.

75
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:06,320
By 1989, The Simpsons had become so popular that they were upgraded from segment to series,

76
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:11,040
and so began one of the most influential television programs in the history of American

77
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:16,320
entertainment. It's remarkable just how different The Simpsons was than anything else on television

78
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:22,160
at the time. It was edgy, subversive counterculture from an underground artist. The show was

79
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:27,520
experimental, avant-garde, and even postmodern at times. It was the first mainstream show to

80
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:32,720
repeatedly reference and parody other media, relying on the audience's own knowledge of

81
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:38,160
movies and TV for much of its humor. The show was free to determine its own creative direction

82
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:44,320
without network interference, a liberty that was virtually unheard of in 1989. Not to mention that

83
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:49,840
the series was animated, a genre that for the past two decades was exclusively associated with

84
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:55,680
children, toys, and breakfast cereal. The Simpsons broke so many molds that it's almost preposterous

85
00:07:55,680 --> 00:08:01,040
to consider a show this brazen airing on network television in prime time. The series essentially

86
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:05,840
rebelled against all of mainstream television and ended up taking much of America with it.

87
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:11,440
Season one debuted to an audience of 30 million people, immediately cementing itself as Fox's

88
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:16,560
flagship series. The mischievous Bart Simpson became a cultural icon, one of the first

89
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:21,520
characters to truly appeal to the slacker mentality of the 90s. The character embodied

90
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:27,280
the overall spirit of the show, defiant, unapologetic, and anti-authority. The series was

91
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:33,120
simultaneously beloved and controversial. It was unafraid to challenge America's most revered

92
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:39,120
institutions. To make American families a lot more like the Waltons and a lot less like the Simpsons.

93
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:43,440
Hey, we're just like the Waltons. We're praying for an end to the depression too.

94
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:49,600
It's easy to imagine a TV show mocking the president now. It's all but cliche at this point,

95
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:54,880
but in 1992 it was almost unthinkable. Much to the chagrin of President Bush,

96
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:59,200
American TV families became much more like the Simpsons by the end of the decade.

97
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:04,160
These talking dinosaurs are more real than most real families on TV.

98
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:08,880
Eventually audiences ended up resonating more with the yellow cartoon family than many of the

99
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:15,040
others portrayed by real-life actors. The Simpsons didn't just challenge the status quo, it redefined

100
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:20,480
the status quo in its own image. And while it began its run as the anti-sitcom, the show would

101
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:25,680
eventually transform into something entirely different. Hello, I'm The Real Jims, some guy

102
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:30,560
who talks about The Simpsons on YouTube, and this is the history of The Simpsons Showrunners, seasons

103
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:37,920
one through seven. The first two seasons were run by a combination of Matt Groening, James L. Brooks,

104
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:42,960
and Sam Simon. Obviously these early years were very developmental, so all three of them brought

105
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:48,240
a skill set that would build the foundation of the show. Season one is well known for its rather

106
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:53,280
rough animation, although things improved significantly halfway through. The early years

107
00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:58,080
were considerably more down to earth and character driven in terms of their plot and joke writing.

108
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:02,800
They loved doing fantasy sequences, but weren't about those fast-paced cutaway jokes or anything

109
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:08,800
yet. They kept things small, kept the focus on the family. However, Bart was the breakout star

110
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:13,360
and got a lot of the attention in these early years. Season two was more about the world

111
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:17,840
building, introducing tons of new characters and giving people like Skinner, Mr. Burns,

112
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:22,400
and Grandpa spotlights. These stories became slightly more topical and satirical,

113
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:27,120
and the characters watched more TV. You can see moments where things are getting a lot more wacky,

114
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:30,880
but by and large, these first two seasons were about telling these classy,

115
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:36,160
focused, character-driven stories with few gimmicks. For seasons three and four,

116
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:41,040
Al Jean and Mike Reese took over as showrunners. This was where the show became significantly more

117
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:46,000
referential and bouncy, so to speak. They weren't afraid to cut away to something else to do a quick

118
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:51,520
joke, or suddenly do these extremely elaborate homages. Maybe cut to the TV for some movie

119
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:57,040
parodies. We get more B-plots and converging storylines. There was a stronger Hollywood vibe

120
00:10:57,040 --> 00:11:02,000
to this era. You'd get these big guest star extravaganzas like Homer at the Bat and Krusty

121
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:07,520
Gets Busted. Season three tried to keep one toe in the season two pond, take a more balanced

122
00:11:07,520 --> 00:11:12,640
approach, whereas season four pushed the show in a more surreal direction. Although that might be

123
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:18,000
a symptom of more Homer-focused episodes. By season four, the balance between Homer and Bart

124
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:23,360
tilted much farther in Captain Wacky's direction. That being said, it never reached the point of

125
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:28,480
just being a meta-comedy. These punchy pop culture references were balanced by actual

126
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:32,960
character drama. It's not just a silly romp through Duff Gardens, it's also about Selma

127
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:38,080
wanting to have a baby, or that Lisa needs braces. Seasons three and four took these extremely

128
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:42,080
down-to-earth character storylines and told them in the most cuckoo bananas way possible.

129
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:47,600
Seasons five and six, helmed by new showrunner David Merkin, took the show in a bigger and

130
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:53,440
more high concept direction. I think big is the best descriptor of this era. You'd get Homer going

131
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:58,080
into space, Bart becoming famous, Springfield legalizing gambling, Lisa taking on the toy

132
00:11:58,080 --> 00:12:03,120
industry, and that's just season five. Whereas season six concluded with Who Shot Mr. Burns,

133
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:07,440
and filled the rest of the season with mysteries, conspiracies, and life or death situations.

134
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:13,200
These seasons loved the big Springfield stories, loved finding excuses for the residents to devolve

135
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:18,560
into an angry mob. Their homage and parody game was still strong, sometimes evolving into full

136
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:23,680
length episode parodies. This was also the rise of screw the audience jokes, in which they

137
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:29,360
explicitly set up a fake punchline, and then do the exact opposite. The jokes became considerably

138
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:34,320
more subversive and sarcastic, constantly playing games with the audience. There's a higher sense

139
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:38,960
of self-awareness here. The audience has seen a lot of their tricks already, so they gotta

140
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:45,120
keep us guessing. Veteran writers Bill Oakley and Josh Weinstein took over the show in seasons seven

141
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:50,080
and eight. Season seven took the subversiveness and meta humor of the previous year, and applied

142
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:54,480
it to the types of stories from the early years. There was more of an emphasis to bring things

143
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:59,440
back to the family, tell these emotional character stories like Mother Simpson and Home Sweet Home

144
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:04,960
Diddly Dum Doodly. But it wasn't just a throwback, they took a more experimental approach. Let's do

145
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:10,720
an extremely mundane and observational simulation of George Bush. Now let's do a bunch of short

146
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:16,240
sketches and pulp fiction homages. Season seven loved experimenting with its characters, putting

147
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:21,200
them in these strange high concept situations and deconstructing who they actually are.

148
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:27,040
By now, it should be clear that the show had evolved into something far beyond a simple riff

149
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:33,680
on the 80s sitcom. But this isn't even close to its final form. In season eight, they pushed things even

150
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:41,840
further. Season eight of The Simpsons would mark the final run of the Oakley and Weinstein era.

151
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:47,200
Many consider it the last hurrah of The Simpsons Golden Age. But before their departure, the

152
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:52,640
showrunners were about to take the series to strange new places. Season eight features the

153
00:13:52,640 --> 00:13:58,480
most ambitious and experimental episodes that The Simpsons has ever produced. It pushed the concepts

154
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:03,200
and characters within the show to their absolute limit. The episodes were perhaps the most

155
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:09,040
self-aware and meta in the history of the series. They didn't stop at just breaking the fourth wall.

156
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:14,400
At times, they deconstructed the television industry at large, and on one occasion, The

157
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:20,880
Simpsons went so far as to deconstruct itself. It is the most ambitious and high concept episode of

158
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:26,720
The Simpsons' most ambitious and high concept season. At long last, we have arrived at Homer's

159
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:32,080
Enemy. It's an episode that presents The Simpsons in their natural habitat, but with a single

160
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:38,320
addition. Frank Grimes was created not just as a foil for Homer, but as a foil to the series itself.

161
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:45,040
In many other settings, he would be a hero, but in Springfield, USA, there is no greater antagonist.

162
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:50,720
Grimes is a prime example of a sympathetic villain. His work ethic is admirable and his

163
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:56,160
struggle is relatable. With Frank Grimes, The Simpsons succeeded in making an antagonist so

164
00:14:56,160 --> 00:15:01,040
compelling that he made the audience start to resent the protagonist. Grimes presents a

165
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:05,280
scathing critique of Homer Simpson, the flagship character of the series.

166
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:22,320
Homer's Enemy confronts the most confounding issue of our time, inequity. The character of

167
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:28,480
Frank Grimes was conceived to resemble actor William H. Macy, who often portrayed downtrodden

168
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:34,080
working-class roles. Grimes would end up being voiced by longtime Simpsons cast member Hank

169
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:39,680
Azaria, who delivered what is in all likelihood his greatest performance of the series. Azaria

170
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:44,960
described the performance as the most emotional and meticulous he had ever attempted. His goal

171
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:50,640
was to portray Grimes with a seething passion underneath a totally calm exterior, such as the

172
00:15:50,640 --> 00:15:55,840
temperament of many working-class people today. Everyone knows what it's like to be treated

173
00:15:55,840 --> 00:16:01,200
unfairly. It's one of the most frustrating experiences imaginable. When we contribute

174
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:06,960
to society we do so under the expectation that our effort will be rewarded. This doctrine is

175
00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:12,480
the essence of the American Dream. What does it mean to be American?

176
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:16,800
It's a question that will remain forever contested depending on who you ask,

177
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:22,480
but in my humble opinion, the spirit of the United States is rooted in ambition and discontent.

178
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:29,360
Ambition creates discontent. The desire to change the status quo drives people to demand something

179
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:34,160
greater. It's what drives people to give up everything they ever knew and cross an ocean.

180
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:38,240
It's what drives people to overthrow the most powerful monarchy in the world.

181
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:43,200
It's what drives people to venture into parts unknown in search of gold, oil and whatever else

182
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:48,240
that might make tomorrow a better day. The American frontier saw people risk everything

183
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:54,080
for the opportunity of prosperity and individual liberty. They operated under the simple ideal of

184
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:58,800
a man controlling his destiny through only his own passion and self-reliance.

185
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:04,080
Frank Grimes represents the classical American hero, the only problem being that he exists

186
00:17:04,080 --> 00:17:09,600
in modern America, where the idyllic frontier has been all but replaced with catatonically

187
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:15,200
tapping away at a computer for 40 hours a week. In most aspects, the US is no longer the land

188
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:20,720
of opportunity as it was once regarded. Many Americans now experience disillusionment with

189
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:25,840
the American dream, believing that we are now subject to the same kind of tyrannical oligarchy

190
00:17:25,840 --> 00:17:30,880
from which our forefathers originally fled. The only difference now is that we have run out of

191
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:37,120
oceans to cross. Frank Grimes not only witnesses his own efforts fail to improve his standing,

192
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:41,600
he witnesses Homer prosper from a lifetime of sloth and ignorance.

193
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:46,960
Homer's outcome reflects the American dream, but his actions reflect the antithesis.

194
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:52,640
The episode raises a serious question, one that potentially threatens our entire perception of the

195
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:58,480
series. If we believe in the simple principle that hard work deserves to be rewarded, then shouldn't

196
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:06,240
we resent Homer Simpson? Well, why do we like Homer Simpson? There's no denying that Homer is

197
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:12,000
a very flawed character. Simpsons writer John Schwartzwelder suggested that Homer may embody

198
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:17,600
all seven deadly sins. Many aspects of his character are quite unpleasant, if not downright

199
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:24,240
unflattering. At times, he is reckless, ignorant, impulsive, and over-emotional. He is the spitting

200
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:29,760
image of how people from other countries stereotype Americans. An overweight, lazy,

201
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:35,120
dim-witted consumer. You can call Homer many things, but one thing you can't call him is

202
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:41,760
pretentious. Homer Simpson is the real deal. He doesn't hide behind a sanctimonious persona.

203
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:46,400
The truth is that we like Homer because he represents all of us, whether we want to admit

204
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:53,200
it or not. In complete contrast to ambition and discontent, Homer embodies a totally opposite but

205
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:59,360
equally American ideal, laissez-faire. The attitude of letting the world around you run its own

206
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:04,800
course. Such is the essence of freedom and individual liberty. Only by relinquishing

207
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:11,280
control over others can we ensure our own agency to do as we please. Laissez-faire is most commonly

208
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:16,720
mentioned in economics as the key principle of capitalism, which, depending on who you ask,

209
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:23,200
is the cause of and solution to all of life's problems. Laissez-faire created Homer and it also

210
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:29,520
created Mr. Burns. Is true freedom even attainable if its unaltered state inevitably resurrects

211
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:34,880
tyranny? Pretty much every political belief system today exists to answer this question in

212
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:40,160
one way or another. Realizing that perpetual endlessness of political debate can easily

213
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:46,400
force us into a nihilistic outlook of society at large, but Homer Simpson may offer us a way out.

214
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:49,200
Something very zen about this episode, you know, it's Homer's

215
00:19:49,920 --> 00:19:55,040
blind happiness, his ignorant bliss, that just gets him through, you know?

216
00:19:55,840 --> 00:20:01,440
Despite his overwhelming flaws, Homer has managed to reach a state of modern day enlightenment.

217
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:06,240
His childlike ignorance has liberated him from the rat race and the cult of work.

218
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:11,200
He somehow exists in total harmony with the frustrations of 20th century life.

219
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:15,200
In a world where everything has become so nauseatingly complex,

220
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:21,520
Homer represents a return to simplicity. He goes to work, clocks in, and gets paid to do nothing.

221
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:26,560
He is essentially stealing from the most evil man in town and he doesn't even question it.

222
00:20:26,560 --> 00:20:34,400
Homer, I don't use the word hero very often, but you are the greatest hero in American history.

223
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:39,760
If Grimes represents the classical American hero, then Homer may very well be the modern

224
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:45,520
American hero. Sometimes the best way to fight the system is not to rebel against the system,

225
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:50,320
but to exploit the system. Hey, you seem like a great guy, so I'll give you a little tip.

226
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:55,120
If you turn that security camera around, you can sleep and no one will ever know.

227
00:20:55,760 --> 00:21:01,040
With a character like Homer, there's beauty and imperfection. Unlike an ideal father figure,

228
00:21:01,040 --> 00:21:06,000
he doesn't always have all the right answers, but watching his misadventures provides us with

229
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:10,160
solace that for as much as we screw up, things can still wind up okay.

230
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:30,400
Not everyone can be like Homer. Not everyone should be like Grimes.

231
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:33,200
Society can only function with a good mix of both.

232
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:38,400
It's easy to feel sympathy for the plight of Frank Grimes, but at the end of the day,

233
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:45,280
Homer is not his enemy. Hating Homer is kind of like hating your dog. Sure, they may inconvenience

234
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:50,240
us, but that's just the price you pay for unconditional affection. With all the cruelty

235
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:55,840
in the modern world, it's about all you can ask for. At the end of the day, Homer has a heart of

236
00:21:55,840 --> 00:22:02,320
gold, even if sometimes he has a hard time showing it. Where Grimes goes wrong is blaming Homer for

237
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:13,040
his own misfortune. Perhaps the best scene in the episode is Frank Grimes snapping at the sight of

238
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:19,920
the Simpsons' home. Realizing Homer's material wealth utterly destroys Grimes' outlook on life,

239
00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:25,520
the sheer unfairness of the situation transforms his relationship with Homer from mild annoyance

240
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:31,760
to bitter hostility. Homer's enemy draws many parallels to Arthur Miller's death of a salesman,

241
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:36,560
one of the first high-profile works to truly question the ideals of the American dream.

242
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:42,000
Death of a Salesman's Willy Loman is a misfortunate, exhausted worker who measures his

243
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:47,600
life's worth through popularity and material wealth. He becomes so paralyzed by this idea

244
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:53,920
of success that he loses his grip on reality. Likewise is the story and fate of Frank Grimes,

245
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:59,840
who comes to resent Homer's popularity and material wealth. However, this perceived injustice

246
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:06,320
is ultimately an illusion stemming from Grimes' incongruent concept of success. Homer was never

247
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:12,640
wealthy because of his success, nor was he successful because of his wealth. Homer is where

248
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:18,400
he is because of the intrinsic value he places in the people and world around him. This theme is

249
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:23,360
accented by the B-plot of the episode, where Bart buys an abandoned factory that everyone else

250
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:28,000
thinks is worthless. If most of us bought a factory at auction, we would immediately become

251
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:34,000
consumed by thoughts of profit, value, maintenance, and renovation. When Bart buys a factory, the only

252
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:39,760
thing he thinks about is how he can use it as an extended playground. This premise is a microcosm

253
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:45,520
of how Homer is successful and Grimes is miserable. It is specifically referenced in the dinner scene

254
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:53,680
to punctuate this distinction. During his rant, Grimes doesn't care about who Bart is as a

255
00:23:53,680 --> 00:23:59,680
person. He only bemoans the unfairness of his material possession. Contrast this response with

256
00:23:59,680 --> 00:24:05,360
Homer reacting to Grimes' life story. I live in a single room above a bowling alley and below

257
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:11,360
another bowling alley. Wow. While Grimes complains about living between two bowling alleys,

258
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:16,400
Homer is impressed. I believe that referencing a bowling alley with this line was a deliberate

259
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:21,520
choice by the writers to remind the viewer of Homer's lost dream of working in a bowling alley,

260
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:24,800
a dream he chose to sacrifice for the good of his family.

261
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:32,400
Ultimately, status and material possessions do not determine our character. Our value as

262
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:38,240
individuals is dictated by how we act in our most challenging moments. When push comes to shove,

263
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:44,080
Homer chooses to be kind and forgiving, while Grimes chooses to be spiteful and vindictive.

264
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:48,240
I would die a happy man if I could prove to you that Homer Simpson has the intelligence of a

265
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:54,480
six-year-old. Frank Grimes' fatal flaw is spawned through his obsession with fairness. Unlike the

266
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:59,680
principle of freedom, fairness is not something that can be explicitly given or taken away.

267
00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:06,640
It will always be fundamentally tied to randomness and chance. The sad reality is that life is

268
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:12,720
inherently unfair. There will always be someone more fortunate than you, but by that same token,

269
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:17,840
there will always be someone less fortunate than you. Tomorrow you could win the lottery and then

270
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:23,440
die from a lightning strike. Would that be fair? It's impossible to answer because both of those

271
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:29,680
events are entirely out of our control. They exist beyond the scope of our influence. Even in our

272
00:25:29,680 --> 00:25:35,120
most systematic attempts to practice fairness, inequality always manages to slip through the

273
00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:41,440
cracks. There is no such thing as an absolutely fair system. Someone will always be getting the

274
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:47,280
short end of the stick. By trying to sabotage and humiliate Homer according to what he thinks his

275
00:25:47,280 --> 00:25:52,880
co-worker deserves, Frank Grimes is entering himself into an unwinnable battle. In the end,

276
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:58,800
his obsession with fairness ultimately drives him mad. The idea of rewarding a man as incompetent

277
00:25:58,800 --> 00:26:09,520
as Homer Simpson is simply too much for him to bear. Homer's job as a safety inspector at the

278
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:15,360
nuclear power plant is one of the most iconic gags in the entire show. The premise of a buffoon being

279
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:21,360
responsible for preventing a reactor meltdown is as hilarious as it is dark. If you ask me,

280
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:26,480
however, the whole setup is a perfect metaphor for Homer's outlook towards the universe.

281
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:31,360
He exists in one of the most stressful environments possible, yet his only concerns rest

282
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:37,600
within his narrow slice of the world. Homer is destined to remain forever content, even if the

283
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:47,440
world melts down around him. There will never be an elegant, harmonious solution to all of

284
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:53,360
America's problems. A part of America will always be fighting, and another part will just sit back

285
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:59,440
and watch the fireworks. The engine of America is powered by turmoil. No matter how tough things

286
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:14,240
get, it just keeps on chugging ahead. The end of Homer's Enemy is one of the darkest moments of

287
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:19,760
the entire series. The audience is intended to laugh at Frank Grimes's epic meltdown,

288
00:27:19,760 --> 00:27:26,080
but at the time, not everyone found it funny. When this came out, I really recall it made half the

289
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:32,240
audience very mad. The more recent generation loves this episode, but when it first came out,

290
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:37,280
a lot of people got very angry about it. Upon release, the episode stirred controversy among

291
00:27:37,280 --> 00:27:43,040
the Simpsons faithful. The grisly ending polarized viewers who had actually grown attached to Homer's

292
00:27:43,040 --> 00:27:48,560
Enemy. Frank Grimes was so persuasive that he successfully turned a part of the audience against

293
00:27:48,560 --> 00:27:53,680
the face of the show. In just a single episode, the Simpsons introduced the most compelling

294
00:27:53,680 --> 00:27:59,360
antagonist in the history of the series and then utterly dismantled him. They took the classical

295
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:04,800
American hero and lowered him in a casket among gregarious laughter. Looking back, one has to

296
00:28:04,800 --> 00:28:10,080
wonder if the series was burying more than just Grimes at the end of this episode. The origin of

297
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:17,920
this episode was what if a guy seemingly from the real world had to come deal with Homer. The

298
00:28:17,920 --> 00:28:23,200
original concept for the character of Frank Grimes was taking a normal hard-working man and placing

299
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:28,640
him in the satirical and often nonsensical cartoon town of Springfield. He was designed to be

300
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:33,920
categorically unlike any other character on the show. It's for this reason why many have since

301
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:40,560
labeled Grimes as one of the most unique characters in Simpsons history. Except, there is one other

302
00:28:40,560 --> 00:28:45,840
character in the series lineage who does bear a striking resemblance to Grimes. A character who

303
00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:51,520
on many occasions showed great envy, insecurity, and vindictiveness towards one of his peers.

304
00:28:51,520 --> 00:28:56,880
The name of this character is Homer Simpson. You know, if you gave Ned Flanders a chance... Oh,

305
00:28:56,880 --> 00:29:00,720
here we go again. Look, I don't care if Ned Flanders is the nicest guy in the world, he's a

306
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:06,720
jerk. In the beginning, Homer's enemy lived right next door to the Simpsons. Ned Flanders served the

307
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:12,880
role of Homer's original foil. He represented the idealized role model of traditional family sitcoms.

308
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:18,320
This era of the show featured a much more desperate and frustrated Homer, one who would go

309
00:29:18,320 --> 00:29:23,600
through great lengths to try to measure up to the more wealthy and popular Flanders. Early plots of

310
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:28,320
the Simpsons were frequently driven by Homer's jealousy of Flanders' material possessions.

311
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:34,080
Beyond matters of wealth, Flanders highlighted Homer's inadequacies as a father. You were right

312
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:40,480
the first time! He's perfect! Perfect in every way! A major theme in the early seasons is Homer

313
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:45,120
learning to accept the imperfections of his family. The Simpsons may look dysfunctional

314
00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:50,640
versus the picturesque and well-behaved Flanders, but that's okay, because the Simpsons don't have

315
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:56,160
to be the Flanders. This conflict effectively captured the original spirit of the show,

316
00:29:56,160 --> 00:30:01,760
eventually culminating in the season 3 episode when Flanders failed. It's an episode that eerily

317
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:07,040
mirrors Homer's enemy, but with the roles reversed. Despite Flanders only showing Homer

318
00:30:07,040 --> 00:30:13,840
hospitality and kindness, Homer still roots for his demise. For once, Homer actually gets his wish,

319
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:18,560
and only then does he realize that the ultimate triumph over his adversary hasn't made him any

320
00:30:18,560 --> 00:30:23,360
more happy. Many fans of the show wonder what could have happened to the character of Frank

321
00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:28,160
Grimes if he wasn't killed off after a single appearance. It turns out the answer may have

322
00:30:28,160 --> 00:30:30,320
been hiding in plain sight all along.

323
00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:31,760
Hey, you okay, Grimy?

324
00:30:31,760 --> 00:30:34,480
I'm better than okay. I'm Homer Simpson!

325
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:39,520
Only by viewing Homer's Enemy through the totality of the series can we truly grasp the brilliance

326
00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:44,480
of the episode. Homer's Enemy is not just a critique about the regression of the American

327
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:50,560
Dream, it is a testament to the progression of The Simpsons. When Homer encounters Frank Grimes,

328
00:30:50,560 --> 00:30:55,920
he is essentially meeting an earlier version of himself. It could be said that the original vision

329
00:30:55,920 --> 00:31:01,440
of The Simpsons was to confront the whimsical television landscape with a brutal dose of realism.

330
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:08,880
The sitcoms that I grew up with presented a sort of weird, zombified ideal of the American family,

331
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:12,480
and it didn't relate to anyone I knew in reality.

332
00:31:13,040 --> 00:31:17,760
The show began with a series of grounded and unromantic stories designed to challenge

333
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:21,760
the establishment in place around them. What they never envisioned, however,

334
00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:27,040
was becoming the establishment. By the late 90s, The Simpsons were larger than life.

335
00:31:27,040 --> 00:31:31,120
They had become an American institution and a worldwide phenomenon.

336
00:31:31,120 --> 00:31:35,120
The show had accomplished more than its creators could have possibly imagined.

337
00:31:35,120 --> 00:31:40,240
The Simpsons always prided itself on being at the cutting edge of nuanced, subversive comedy.

338
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:45,040
They pioneered an entirely new genre of programming. Pioneers will always get a lot

339
00:31:45,040 --> 00:31:50,000
of credit for whatever they discover. They take unthinkable risks at a time when the odds are

340
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:55,280
completely against their favor. However, every pioneer knows deep down that they will inevitably

341
00:31:55,280 --> 00:32:02,080
be overtaken by their successors. After eight seasons and 175 episodes, The Simpsons were

342
00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:14,720
running out of stories to tell. There comes a time in all of our lives when we want to go out

343
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:20,400
and change the world, to break free from the system. Eventually, though, life always catches

344
00:32:20,400 --> 00:32:26,400
back up to us. Being like Frank Grimes is inherently unsustainable. Sometimes the only

345
00:32:26,400 --> 00:32:32,160
option left is to be like Homer. Following the end of the eighth season, showrunners Bill Oakley

346
00:32:32,160 --> 00:32:36,960
and Josh Weinstein departed to work on the ill-fated Mission Hill. Matt Groening was

347
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:41,760
all but checked out of The Simpsons at this point, focusing much of his attention on developing the

348
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:47,920
concept for his new series, Futurama. Starting with season nine, The Simpsons began what can

349
00:32:47,920 --> 00:32:58,000
only be described as a long slow march to mediocrity. It's extraordinarily sad to still

350
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:03,200
see The Simpsons producing new episodes today. It's like watching a dominant athlete have all

351
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:07,760
their remarkable abilities stripped away through the march of time until they are no more special

352
00:33:07,760 --> 00:33:13,360
than the rest of us. There's a reason why many all-time greats in pop culture also happen to die

353
00:33:13,360 --> 00:33:18,720
young. We never get to witness them wither away into a shell of their former glory. The brilliance

354
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:24,080
of those first eight seasons now only amounts to a measly quarter of the show's entire lifespan.

355
00:33:24,080 --> 00:33:28,560
The Simpsons has been on the air so long that YouTube videos complaining about the show's

356
00:33:28,560 --> 00:33:34,560
decline have themselves become stale and cliche. What was once the epitome of media counterculture

357
00:33:34,560 --> 00:33:39,280
is now owned by the epitome of the media establishment. Following Disney's acquisition

358
00:33:39,280 --> 00:33:45,520
of Fox in 2019, The Simpsons featured in a series of uncanny animated bumpers welcoming their new

359
00:33:45,520 --> 00:33:51,120
overlords. Considering the prior two decades of openly trashing the evil empire, it's hard to

360
00:33:51,120 --> 00:33:56,560
believe that this was even the same show anymore. In all honesty, The Simpsons was never designed to

361
00:33:56,560 --> 00:34:02,400
survive until the 21st century. The big media conglomerates just keep it around as a ceremonial

362
00:34:02,400 --> 00:34:08,160
token to evoke nostalgia for better times. At this point, Homer Simpson has been relegated to a

363
00:34:08,160 --> 00:34:13,120
figurehead akin to the likes of Mickey Mouse and the Queen of England. Like many other forms of

364
00:34:13,120 --> 00:34:17,840
counterculture, The Simpsons ended up becoming the very thing they sought to destroy.

365
00:34:17,840 --> 00:34:20,560
If I had a TV show, I'd run that supper into the ground.

366
00:34:24,640 --> 00:34:27,760
Don't cry for me. I'm already dead.

367
00:34:32,400 --> 00:34:36,640
The Simpsons may have fallen hard, but we only see it that way because its original

368
00:34:36,640 --> 00:34:41,360
runs set the bar so high. Lots of people today have been amazed by The Simpsons'

369
00:34:41,360 --> 00:34:46,480
remarkable ability to prophesize modern-day events in past episodes. The truth is that

370
00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:51,600
for as wacky of a place Springfield is, it was entirely modeled off our reality.

371
00:34:51,600 --> 00:34:54,880
As you know, we've inherited quite a budget crunch from President Trump.

372
00:34:55,440 --> 00:35:01,040
America is still America, and certain patterns in history tend to repeat themselves. If anything,

373
00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:05,840
The Simpsons predicting the future serves more as a testament to how tuned in the series was

374
00:35:05,840 --> 00:35:11,440
to American culture at its peak. The satire of The Simpsons held up a mirror to our world.

375
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:15,760
It shouldn't be much of a surprise when some days we start mimicking the reflection.

376
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:20,640
It's unfortunate to consider how younger generations never had the opportunity to

377
00:35:20,640 --> 00:35:25,520
experience The Simpsons at its creative and cultural peak. While the actual show has never

378
00:35:25,520 --> 00:35:30,240
been less relevant, the spirit of the show has witnessed a rebirth through the rise of remix

379
00:35:30,240 --> 00:35:35,040
culture on the internet. One could say that the fast-paced irreverent attitude of The Simpsons

380
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:39,840
perfectly foreshadowed interactions on the internet today. Much like a certain young

381
00:35:39,840 --> 00:35:45,440
cartoonist from Oregon, a new generation of artists is now using The Simpsons as a springboard to break

382
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:51,360
into the cultural space. The life cycle of the show has now come full circle, going from parody

383
00:35:51,360 --> 00:35:57,440
to parodied. So despite its descent into corporate mediocrity, it's at least comforting to realize

384
00:35:57,440 --> 00:36:02,960
that The Simpsons is still contributing to culture in a meaningful way. One such contribution was

385
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:08,080
made by British underground street artist Banksy, whose brutally unflattering satirization of The

386
00:36:08,080 --> 00:36:13,920
Simpsons was aired as part of a 2010 episode. Banksy once famously reflected on the concept

387
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:19,520
of the second death, when somebody speaks your name for the last time. It suggests that even

388
00:36:19,520 --> 00:36:24,880
if we cease to exist in a physical sense, our legacy will continue to influence those who

389
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:30,400
follow us. Frank Grimes may have only lasted a single episode, but what he accomplished in those

390
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:35,520
few minutes of screen time was unforgettable. There comes a time for every long-running TV

391
00:36:35,520 --> 00:36:40,400
series when they jump the shark. A moment when the creators realize that they have exhausted all of

392
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:45,920
their creative juices and have nowhere to go but down. So they release an episode so unabashedly

393
00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:51,120
preposterous that it fundamentally undermines any immersion in the story, characters, and world

394
00:36:51,120 --> 00:36:57,200
moving forward. With Homer's Enemy, The Simpsons jumped the shark, but in typical Simpsons fashion

395
00:36:57,200 --> 00:37:02,560
they did so in the most brilliant and subversive way. They welcomed an age of mediocrity with the

396
00:37:02,560 --> 00:37:08,480
show's final masterpiece. Homer's Enemy is a monument to a television empire at its absolute

397
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:14,480
peak. It pushes the original artistic vision of the series to its absolute conceptual limit.

398
00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:20,000
In just 23 minutes of screen time, The Simpsons created something so intensely profound that we

399
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:26,000
still think about it more than 23 years later. After it aired, The Simpsons was never the same.

400
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:30,320
It didn't just change the show, it changed the way we looked at the show.

401
00:37:30,320 --> 00:37:35,040
Homer's Enemy was an episode so high concept that it elevated the series from a source of

402
00:37:35,040 --> 00:37:40,560
entertainment to a source of study. It entices the audience to dig deeper and think harder about the

403
00:37:40,560 --> 00:37:46,320
show than they ever have before. Oftentimes the greatest art doesn't give us all the right answers,

404
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:48,320
it makes us ask the right questions.

405
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:59,040
The discussion continues. The great lengths we stray in search of our own interpretation of

406
00:37:59,040 --> 00:38:04,400
Homer's Enemy gives us a wider appreciation of the series as a whole. A majority of Simpsons

407
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:09,920
episodes are not spectacular. Many of them are hard to even call entertaining, but we don't

408
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:14,640
remember the series for those episodes. When people think of The Simpsons, they think of an

409
00:38:14,640 --> 00:38:19,760
incredible show. They think of a show that redefined comedy and satire. They think of a

410
00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:24,720
show that pushed the boundaries of what was possible on television. They think of a show so

411
00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:30,000
influential that every other show would eventually copy it in some way. The legacy of The Simpsons

412
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:34,960
has always been defined as a show that stood out from everything else around it. So to answer the

413
00:38:34,960 --> 00:38:39,840
question, why are The Simpsons green, we may instead want to ask why The Simpsons are yellow.

414
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:45,440
So yellow skin, why? Because it looks like there's something wrong with your TV set.

415
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:51,440
Sometimes a small tweak in what we find familiar is all it takes to change our whole perspective.

416
00:38:51,440 --> 00:38:57,040
The Simpsons made everyone stop to adjust their TV sets, but the picture within was never broken.

417
00:38:57,040 --> 00:39:02,720
Everything else around it was. The Simpsons opened our eyes to the yellowness of the whole world.

418
00:39:02,720 --> 00:39:08,640
After a while, we no longer questioned why The Simpsons were yellow, they simply were. It was

419
00:39:08,640 --> 00:39:14,160
only then when for just one moment, the creators had nothing else to do but to make them green.

420
00:39:14,160 --> 00:39:19,600
Homer's enemy is The Simpsons Magnum Opus, and there will never ever be another episode like it.

421
