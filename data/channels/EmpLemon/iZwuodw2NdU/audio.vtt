People of YouTube, welcome back to another edition of Emperor Lemons Summer Bummer.

00:11.980 --> 00:16.000
So this year I went to VidCon and I really didn't know what to expect.

00:16.000 --> 00:20.040
I heard some good things, I heard some bad things, but most of all I was too lazy to

00:20.040 --> 00:22.480
actually research anything about it.

00:22.480 --> 00:27.280
I joined up with local delinquent Rusty Cage and we ventured out of the gloomy swamps of

00:27.280 --> 00:30.760
Florida towards sunny Anaheim, California.

00:30.760 --> 00:33.440
What happened next may shock you.

00:33.440 --> 00:40.960
VidCon is actually pretty freakin' epic.

00:40.960 --> 00:45.480
Needless to say my expectations were blown totally out of the water and I wanted to make

00:45.480 --> 00:47.800
a video sharing my experiences.

00:47.800 --> 00:52.280
So I took to Twitter and had my fans submit questions about VidCon and hopefully after

00:52.280 --> 00:56.240
this video you'll all know a little bit more about it than I did going in.

00:56.240 --> 01:24.240
Well this sucks.

01:24.240 --> 01:27.600
This is probably the number one question for most of you.

01:27.600 --> 01:33.440
Is this whole place just infested with screaming kids and obnoxious egomaniacs?

01:33.440 --> 01:34.940
Well not really.

01:34.940 --> 01:39.240
As far as conventions go the clientele at VidCon are pretty normal.

01:39.240 --> 01:42.720
Far more normal than most conventions I've been to.

01:42.720 --> 01:48.680
Like any big convention it's crowded and loud, there are vendors and giant screens.

01:48.680 --> 01:53.920
So I guess if you don't like that then you're gonna have a bad time at VidCon and any other

01:53.920 --> 01:54.920
convention.

01:54.920 --> 01:59.080
Yeah there are a lot of kids but most of them I saw were under parental supervision.

01:59.080 --> 02:02.560
I didn't see any vloggers inciting riots either.

02:02.560 --> 02:06.320
After just half an hour walking around the convention I realized that it's notoriety

02:06.320 --> 02:17.680
had been cherry picked and exaggerated like many things on the internet.

02:17.680 --> 02:22.400
This seemed to be another preconception of VidCon that it's all a big manipulative vanity

02:22.400 --> 02:24.960
project for rich YouTubers to get richer.

02:24.960 --> 02:28.480
I will admit that VidCon is a very corporate event.

02:28.480 --> 02:32.320
There's a ton of brands and merchandising and marketing involved here.

02:32.320 --> 02:36.080
But once again this is true for pretty much any big convention.

02:36.080 --> 02:39.560
When you have a ton of people drawn to one place there's gonna be companies trying to

02:39.560 --> 02:41.040
sell you stuff.

02:41.040 --> 02:45.960
As for the YouTubers I would argue that VidCon does just as much to help grow small YouTubers

02:45.960 --> 02:48.160
as it does to help big ones.

02:48.160 --> 02:51.960
Small YouTubers certainly have much more to gain exposure wise.

02:51.960 --> 02:53.660
VidCon already knows the big guys.

02:53.660 --> 02:58.240
It's the small unknown channels that can benefit the most from networking.

02:58.240 --> 03:02.600
As for the money I for one think it's great that TheOdd1sOut has hundreds of people waiting

03:02.600 --> 03:04.360
in line to buy his merch.

03:04.360 --> 03:09.140
Four years ago he was a nobody like most of you watching and now he's making bank.

03:09.140 --> 03:13.520
It's easy to hate on the rich and successful but we should celebrate that a guy like TheOdd1sOut

03:13.520 --> 03:16.140
can even be rich and successful.

03:16.140 --> 03:21.520
Regular people can't just become a movie star or pro athlete or CEO in a few years but they

03:21.520 --> 03:26.800
can become a successful YouTuber and I think we should appreciate how that's even possible.

03:26.800 --> 03:31.600
But hey, that's just a theory.

03:31.600 --> 03:35.840
What do you think about VidCon being owned by one of the biggest offenders of copyright

03:35.840 --> 03:37.400
claim abuse?

03:37.400 --> 03:38.840
Viacom.

03:38.840 --> 03:45.360
I mentioned this in the last episode of YouTube Geographic but VidCon is in fact property

03:45.360 --> 03:50.360
of Viacom, the most notorious copyright abuser in the history of YouTube.

03:50.360 --> 03:54.480
Do I feel dirty about giving my hard-earned money to a company like Viacom?

03:54.480 --> 03:56.120
Yeah, a little.

03:56.120 --> 04:00.640
But I would have felt about the same had I paid money to go to Disneyland right next door.

04:00.640 --> 04:05.840
Apparently there was once a time when VidCon was a grassroots event run by YouTubers for

04:05.840 --> 04:08.980
YouTubers, but that time has long since passed.

04:08.980 --> 04:13.720
Every growing property is doomed to be bought out by a bigger, blander entity.

04:13.720 --> 04:15.480
That's just the way the world works.

04:15.480 --> 04:19.360
Now I can't speak from experience but after hearing other YouTubers who attended the event

04:19.360 --> 04:24.080
multiple years, the Viacom buyout did seem to make the event much more corporate and

04:24.080 --> 04:29.760
sanitized than in prior years with a fairly heavy emphasis on marketing to children, which

04:29.760 --> 04:31.140
is a shame.

04:31.140 --> 04:35.100
But then again, that's exactly the same thing YouTube has been doing so I guess it's somewhat

04:35.100 --> 04:36.260
fitting.

04:36.260 --> 04:40.960
Did the overall environment seem more geared towards networking and business ventures or

04:40.960 --> 04:45.120
more towards entertainment value and giving guests a good time?

04:45.120 --> 04:50.260
If I had to estimate, I'd say the vast majority of the VidCon audience are fans, so it's no

04:50.260 --> 04:53.500
surprise that the venue is designed to cater to them.

04:53.500 --> 04:58.360
The primary selling point of VidCon is providing an opportunity for fans to meet their favorite

04:58.360 --> 04:59.400
YouTubers.

04:59.400 --> 05:03.240
That's how I imagine they make most of their money, so they're obligated to invest more

05:03.240 --> 05:05.400
in entertainment options.

05:05.400 --> 05:09.680
That's not to say of course that there aren't any networking or business opportunities.

05:09.680 --> 05:12.040
Those options are just far less intuitive.

05:12.040 --> 05:15.920
I found that most of the networking at VidCon goes on independently from the convention

05:15.920 --> 05:18.280
at bars or parties around town.

05:18.280 --> 05:22.540
And I'm not saying that VidCon is totally useless in this aspect either.

05:22.540 --> 05:26.440
It's the spectacle of the convention that brings in all the creators.

05:26.440 --> 05:30.200
You just have to make a lot of the networking happen on your own, which is why if you're

05:30.200 --> 05:34.400
a creator and plan on going to VidCon, I'd recommend traveling in a group because the

05:34.400 --> 05:38.680
more connections you have, the easier it becomes to network with others.

05:38.680 --> 05:43.240
With all the drama YouTube personalities like to thrive off of, did you find it really

05:43.240 --> 05:48.120
refreshing to meet and to know all these YouTubers aren't what they are online and more friendly

05:48.120 --> 05:49.120
in person?

05:49.120 --> 05:53.520
I gotta say, the best part of VidCon for me was getting to meet and hang out with a bunch

05:53.520 --> 05:56.720
of great YouTubers who I've been watching for years.

05:56.720 --> 06:00.480
It was a little bit disorienting at first because I was only used to seeing these guys

06:00.480 --> 06:01.960
on screen.

06:01.960 --> 06:06.240
Looking at all these YouTubers in the same place felt like a fever dream at first, but

06:06.240 --> 06:08.640
eventually it was like hanging out with friends.

06:08.640 --> 06:10.600
Or maybe even beyond that.

06:10.600 --> 06:15.220
Sometimes when watching videos we lose sight of the fact that YouTubers are just people.

06:15.220 --> 06:19.520
Really interesting, unique, and creative people who are all connected by the simple passion

06:19.520 --> 06:21.400
of creating content.

06:21.400 --> 06:26.300
And I'm normally not one to enjoy parties or big social events, but talking to people

06:26.300 --> 06:31.360
at VidCon just felt so easy for me, something I've never really experienced before.

06:31.360 --> 06:36.200
It just felt so great to complain about getting demonetized without having to spend 15 minutes

06:36.200 --> 06:37.960
explaining what that means.

06:37.960 --> 06:41.280
It was definitely the most valuable part of VidCon for me.

06:41.280 --> 06:44.480
Did you see Internet Historian's face?

06:44.480 --> 06:49.160
Yes, I was able to witness the enigmatic mystery of the Internet Historian.

06:49.160 --> 06:53.000
And to no one's surprise, he looks exactly like his online avatar.

06:53.000 --> 06:57.160
Once I confirmed his identity, I was able to send my team of highly paid lawyers to

06:57.160 --> 07:03.560
his home in Dinosaur Island to demand retribution for his blatant theft of my downward spiral.

07:03.560 --> 07:12.720
I call it Internet Historian's southward face in this drunk little town.

07:12.720 --> 07:17.400
No more sugar for you!

07:17.400 --> 07:20.880
Come along with me on my suicide world tour!

07:20.880 --> 07:23.240
Is it five?

07:23.240 --> 07:24.240
Yes!

07:24.240 --> 07:29.640
Unfortunately, I recently discovered that Viacom also stole my spiral and I had to postpone

07:29.640 --> 07:31.640
Harold's legal reckoning.

07:33.680 --> 07:35.640
Were you recognized at VidCon?

07:35.640 --> 07:39.800
I don't believe a single person at VidCon recognized me by looks alone.

07:40.200 --> 07:47.020
Only through my voice and mutual friends could some people deduce who I was, and it was kind of fun surprising people like that.

07:47.200 --> 07:55.040
It was also helpful not being instantly spotted in a crowd of people and being able to swap between getting noticed or staying incognito.

07:55.040 --> 07:58.040
My name is Guy Incognito.

07:58.200 --> 08:00.200
How uncomfortable are fan meetups?

08:00.200 --> 08:05.840
So like I said earlier, I didn't really get openly recognized, so I didn't have to interact with many fans.

08:05.840 --> 08:11.360
I will say that when it did happen, it's as uncomfortable as the fan wants to make it.

08:11.360 --> 08:17.000
I gotta say that if any of you out there ever get the chance to meet me or any other YouTuber you like,

08:17.080 --> 08:23.080
it's best to treat us like a normal person. Please don't grovel or worship the ground we stand on.

08:23.240 --> 08:26.200
We're just regular people like you who happen to make videos.

08:26.200 --> 08:31.920
I'm fine meeting fans in a quick and casual setting, but anything more than that tends to freak me out a bit.

08:32.080 --> 08:36.560
Did you cover your face with those madness glasses like in the live SOTY podcast?

08:36.560 --> 08:42.560
I was planning to because I thought it would make it easier for people to identify me, but unfortunately,

08:42.560 --> 08:46.560
I left the madness at Mumpy Jones's house back when I visited in December.

08:46.560 --> 08:49.760
You know what? Come to think of it, that actually explains a lot.

08:49.760 --> 08:52.760
Oh, that's okay, Mumpy. I'm not hungry anymore.

08:56.240 --> 09:01.440
Were the content creators that have genuine care for their videos promoted more by YouTube?

09:01.440 --> 09:04.560
Or were generic obnoxious vloggers the main focus?

09:04.560 --> 09:06.320
Yo, what's up, everybody?

09:06.320 --> 09:11.360
It's interesting to look at which creators VidCon promote and which ones they tend to ignore.

09:11.360 --> 09:16.560
While the stereotype of popular YouTubers does tend to be the obnoxious vlogger type,

09:16.560 --> 09:19.920
it doesn't really reflect the promoted creators at VidCon.

09:19.920 --> 09:24.720
People like Logan Paul and Tana Mongeau are rumored to have been banned from VidCon

09:24.720 --> 09:29.120
and many ego-driven vlogger types seem to avoid the convention entirely.

09:29.120 --> 09:35.200
At first, there doesn't really seem to be a clear reasoning for which online personalities are represented at VidCon.

09:35.200 --> 09:37.280
There were a lot of storytime animators,

09:37.280 --> 09:43.280
cooking channels, ASMR people, and many others in addition to the typical vloggers you'd expect.

09:43.280 --> 09:47.120
Some of them are big and famous while others I had never heard of.

09:47.120 --> 09:50.480
I talked about this with many people during my stay at the convention

09:50.480 --> 09:54.480
and it starts to make more sense when you realize that a lot of these same creators

09:54.480 --> 09:57.840
are the ones who consistently show up on the trending tab.

09:57.840 --> 10:03.280
Now at this point, it's important to note that VidCon is run independently from YouTube.

10:03.280 --> 10:06.560
While the convention is affiliated with YouTube's brand,

10:06.560 --> 10:10.640
YouTube does not own or control what happens at VidCon.

10:10.640 --> 10:13.440
So why then do we see the same people promoted?

10:13.440 --> 10:18.080
Well, I believe the answer lies within marketability and controversiality.

10:18.080 --> 10:23.920
All of the people you see promoted at VidCon tend to be very marketable and non-controversial.

10:23.920 --> 10:28.080
Storytime animators are very popular among young teens and children,

10:28.080 --> 10:31.920
which makes them very marketable to that valuable demographic.

10:31.920 --> 10:34.240
Cooking channels are totally benign

10:34.240 --> 10:39.360
and they most likely won't cause a political controversy that will cost the convention money.

10:39.360 --> 10:43.600
Business-wise, this makes sense for a venue that wants to turn a profit.

10:43.600 --> 10:46.960
Typically, no one from my neck of the woods gets any special treatment

10:46.960 --> 10:52.320
because I tend to hang around people who are a little more outspoken about criticizing the establishment.

10:52.320 --> 10:58.320
So it should be no surprise that we tend to be the ones who get labeled as unfriendly for advertisers.

10:58.320 --> 11:03.600
It's the same reason why I don't see anyone like me getting invited to speak at these events anytime soon.

11:03.600 --> 11:05.200
And yeah, it may feel unfair,

11:05.200 --> 11:10.720
but it's important for us to not harbor resentment for those creators who do get favored by the system.

11:10.720 --> 11:12.960
Don't hate the player, hit the game.

11:12.960 --> 11:14.720
Is it really worth the money?

11:14.720 --> 11:21.280
Now, considering the cost of air travel, hotels, food, convention tickets, and other expenses,

11:21.280 --> 11:26.240
VidCon can easily run you over a thousand dollars depending on where you're coming from.

11:26.240 --> 11:30.800
It seems like a steep price to pay for what amounts a little more than a networking trip.

11:30.800 --> 11:33.840
Networking that's not even really guaranteed to happen.

11:33.840 --> 11:38.960
In my opinion, by paying to go to VidCon, you're paying for the uniqueness of the event.

11:38.960 --> 11:41.600
If you're a fan, then VidCon may be the only time

11:41.600 --> 11:45.040
you can meet up with so many of your favorite channels in the same place.

11:45.040 --> 11:47.760
If you're a creator, VidCon may be the only time

11:47.760 --> 11:51.040
you can establish meaningful connections with so many of your peers.

11:51.840 --> 11:54.720
If you're strapped for cash or struggling to make ends meet,

11:54.720 --> 11:57.360
then you probably shouldn't spend that much on VidCon

11:57.360 --> 12:01.440
because you're probably not going to see an immediate payout on that investment.

12:01.440 --> 12:05.920
However, if you're working your way up the YouTube ranks and you have some savings to spare,

12:05.920 --> 12:10.000
there's no other place where you can make friends with as many people in the community.

12:10.560 --> 12:14.480
It's difficult to place monetary value on friendships and connections,

12:14.480 --> 12:17.200
but in a highly cooperative setting like YouTube,

12:17.200 --> 12:20.400
networking here is likely much more valuable than anywhere else.

12:25.280 --> 12:29.520
Well, if you're speaking of people you dislike, then you'd call them clout chasers.

12:29.520 --> 12:32.800
If you're speaking of people you like, then you'd call them opportunists.

12:33.440 --> 12:36.800
I was able to meet and talk to a lot of big YouTubers at VidCon,

12:36.800 --> 12:41.440
but the most insightful conversations I had were actually with small YouTubers.

12:41.440 --> 12:44.480
Smaller creators are hungrier and they have a lot more to prove,

12:44.480 --> 12:46.960
which forces them to take a lot more risks.

12:46.960 --> 12:49.120
They can't just rely on following trends,

12:49.120 --> 12:52.240
they have to be the ones experimenting and creating them.

12:52.240 --> 12:55.840
VidCon is ripe with this mentality of hope and opportunity.

12:55.840 --> 12:58.960
In the 1850s, people across the country dropped everything

12:58.960 --> 13:01.440
to venture to California in search of gold.

13:01.440 --> 13:04.560
The atmosphere of VidCon feels largely the same way.

13:07.520 --> 13:12.960
This year's VidCon had a ton of memorable moments.

13:12.960 --> 13:16.320
I got to meet a lot of new people, travel lots of new places,

13:16.320 --> 13:20.480
I got to witness Rusty Cage's psychotic hot dog eating contest,

13:20.480 --> 13:24.160
but for me, the moments I remember most are the simple ones.

13:24.720 --> 13:28.000
My most memorable moment happened when I was sitting down on the couch

13:28.000 --> 13:30.720
with Wang, Wavy Web Surf, and Willy Mac.

13:30.720 --> 13:35.520
It was around 3 a.m., we were winding down from a big day of convention madness.

13:35.600 --> 13:38.640
We're all talking about YouTube, looking forward to the future.

13:38.640 --> 13:41.280
Just a bunch of guys from wildly different backgrounds

13:41.280 --> 13:44.160
all united by the same camaraderie of making videos

13:44.160 --> 13:46.640
for thousands of strangers on the internet.

13:46.640 --> 13:49.520
Then one moment, I lean into them all and say,

13:49.520 --> 13:52.560
that Gamer From Mars is an absolute savage.

13:52.560 --> 13:57.040
This dude sponsored the downfall of ProJared with Vikings War of Clans.

13:57.040 --> 13:59.280
He does not care about what you think.

13:59.280 --> 14:02.320
He will beat you up, buy the rights to your video idea,

14:02.320 --> 14:04.880
and sponsor it with Raid Shadow Legends.

14:04.880 --> 14:07.040
This man is about to end all of our careers.

14:08.240 --> 14:11.600
Attention all Epic gamers, this is the Gamer From Mars

14:11.600 --> 14:16.080
letting you know that I've temporarily taken over Emperor Lemon's account.

14:16.080 --> 14:19.360
Let this be a permanent reminder for all of you listening

14:19.360 --> 14:21.440
not to talk about me behind my back

14:21.440 --> 14:25.520
and also not to leave your computer unattended at VidCon.

14:25.520 --> 14:30.720
But speaking of cyber security, this video is sponsored by NordVPN.

14:30.720 --> 14:33.120
When traveling around on networking trips,

14:33.120 --> 14:37.600
you're bound to connect to a lot of unsecure public Wi-Fi networks

14:37.600 --> 14:41.120
which could leave your information vulnerable to hackers.

14:41.120 --> 14:43.440
NordVPN encrypts your internet connection

14:43.440 --> 14:45.920
so that you can stop worrying about your data

14:45.920 --> 14:47.760
wherever you are in the world.

14:47.760 --> 14:55.120

I'll be giving up his account back now

14:57.040 --> 15:00.400
in exchange of course for the revenue here and from this ad reading.

15:00.960 --> 15:04.960
So now, please stay tuned for more regularly scheduled content.

15:05.520 --> 15:07.360
And remember, if you mess with me

15:07.360 --> 15:10.240
I will take away everything that you know and love.

15:30.400 --> 15:32.400
Thank you for watching.
