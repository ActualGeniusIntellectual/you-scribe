0	11980	People of YouTube, welcome back to another edition of Emperor Lemons Summer Bummer.
11980	16000	So this year I went to VidCon and I really didn't know what to expect.
16000	20040	I heard some good things, I heard some bad things, but most of all I was too lazy to
20040	22480	actually research anything about it.
22480	27280	I joined up with local delinquent Rusty Cage and we ventured out of the gloomy swamps of
27280	30760	Florida towards sunny Anaheim, California.
30760	33440	What happened next may shock you.
33440	40960	VidCon is actually pretty freakin' epic.
40960	45480	Needless to say my expectations were blown totally out of the water and I wanted to make
45480	47800	a video sharing my experiences.
47800	52280	So I took to Twitter and had my fans submit questions about VidCon and hopefully after
52280	56240	this video you'll all know a little bit more about it than I did going in.
56240	84240	Well this sucks.
84240	87600	This is probably the number one question for most of you.
87600	93440	Is this whole place just infested with screaming kids and obnoxious egomaniacs?
93440	94940	Well not really.
94940	99240	As far as conventions go the clientele at VidCon are pretty normal.
99240	102720	Far more normal than most conventions I've been to.
102720	108680	Like any big convention it's crowded and loud, there are vendors and giant screens.
108680	113920	So I guess if you don't like that then you're gonna have a bad time at VidCon and any other
113920	114920	convention.
114920	119080	Yeah there are a lot of kids but most of them I saw were under parental supervision.
119080	122560	I didn't see any vloggers inciting riots either.
122560	126320	After just half an hour walking around the convention I realized that it's notoriety
126320	137680	had been cherry picked and exaggerated like many things on the internet.
137680	142400	This seemed to be another preconception of VidCon that it's all a big manipulative vanity
142400	144960	project for rich YouTubers to get richer.
144960	148480	I will admit that VidCon is a very corporate event.
148480	152320	There's a ton of brands and merchandising and marketing involved here.
152320	156080	But once again this is true for pretty much any big convention.
156080	159560	When you have a ton of people drawn to one place there's gonna be companies trying to
159560	161040	sell you stuff.
161040	165960	As for the YouTubers I would argue that VidCon does just as much to help grow small YouTubers
165960	168160	as it does to help big ones.
168160	171960	Small YouTubers certainly have much more to gain exposure wise.
171960	173660	VidCon already knows the big guys.
173660	178240	It's the small unknown channels that can benefit the most from networking.
178240	182600	As for the money I for one think it's great that TheOdd1sOut has hundreds of people waiting
182600	184360	in line to buy his merch.
184360	189140	Four years ago he was a nobody like most of you watching and now he's making bank.
189140	193520	It's easy to hate on the rich and successful but we should celebrate that a guy like TheOdd1sOut
193520	196140	can even be rich and successful.
196140	201520	Regular people can't just become a movie star or pro athlete or CEO in a few years but they
201520	206800	can become a successful YouTuber and I think we should appreciate how that's even possible.
206800	211600	But hey, that's just a theory.
211600	215840	What do you think about VidCon being owned by one of the biggest offenders of copyright
215840	217400	claim abuse?
217400	218840	Viacom.
218840	225360	I mentioned this in the last episode of YouTube Geographic but VidCon is in fact property
225360	230360	of Viacom, the most notorious copyright abuser in the history of YouTube.
230360	234480	Do I feel dirty about giving my hard-earned money to a company like Viacom?
234480	236120	Yeah, a little.
236120	240640	But I would have felt about the same had I paid money to go to Disneyland right next door.
240640	245840	Apparently there was once a time when VidCon was a grassroots event run by YouTubers for
245840	248980	YouTubers, but that time has long since passed.
248980	253720	Every growing property is doomed to be bought out by a bigger, blander entity.
253720	255480	That's just the way the world works.
255480	259360	Now I can't speak from experience but after hearing other YouTubers who attended the event
259360	264080	multiple years, the Viacom buyout did seem to make the event much more corporate and
264080	269760	sanitized than in prior years with a fairly heavy emphasis on marketing to children, which
269760	271140	is a shame.
271140	275100	But then again, that's exactly the same thing YouTube has been doing so I guess it's somewhat
275100	276260	fitting.
276260	280960	Did the overall environment seem more geared towards networking and business ventures or
280960	285120	more towards entertainment value and giving guests a good time?
285120	290260	If I had to estimate, I'd say the vast majority of the VidCon audience are fans, so it's no
290260	293500	surprise that the venue is designed to cater to them.
293500	298360	The primary selling point of VidCon is providing an opportunity for fans to meet their favorite
298360	299400	YouTubers.
299400	303240	That's how I imagine they make most of their money, so they're obligated to invest more
303240	305400	in entertainment options.
305400	309680	That's not to say of course that there aren't any networking or business opportunities.
309680	312040	Those options are just far less intuitive.
312040	315920	I found that most of the networking at VidCon goes on independently from the convention
315920	318280	at bars or parties around town.
318280	322540	And I'm not saying that VidCon is totally useless in this aspect either.
322540	326440	It's the spectacle of the convention that brings in all the creators.
326440	330200	You just have to make a lot of the networking happen on your own, which is why if you're
330200	334400	a creator and plan on going to VidCon, I'd recommend traveling in a group because the
334400	338680	more connections you have, the easier it becomes to network with others.
338680	343240	With all the drama YouTube personalities like to thrive off of, did you find it really
343240	348120	refreshing to meet and to know all these YouTubers aren't what they are online and more friendly
348120	349120	in person?
349120	353520	I gotta say, the best part of VidCon for me was getting to meet and hang out with a bunch
353520	356720	of great YouTubers who I've been watching for years.
356720	360480	It was a little bit disorienting at first because I was only used to seeing these guys
360480	361960	on screen.
361960	366240	Looking at all these YouTubers in the same place felt like a fever dream at first, but
366240	368640	eventually it was like hanging out with friends.
368640	370600	Or maybe even beyond that.
370600	375220	Sometimes when watching videos we lose sight of the fact that YouTubers are just people.
375220	379520	Really interesting, unique, and creative people who are all connected by the simple passion
379520	381400	of creating content.
381400	386300	And I'm normally not one to enjoy parties or big social events, but talking to people
386300	391360	at VidCon just felt so easy for me, something I've never really experienced before.
391360	396200	It just felt so great to complain about getting demonetized without having to spend 15 minutes
396200	397960	explaining what that means.
397960	401280	It was definitely the most valuable part of VidCon for me.
401280	404480	Did you see Internet Historian's face?
404480	409160	Yes, I was able to witness the enigmatic mystery of the Internet Historian.
409160	413000	And to no one's surprise, he looks exactly like his online avatar.
413000	417160	Once I confirmed his identity, I was able to send my team of highly paid lawyers to
417160	423560	his home in Dinosaur Island to demand retribution for his blatant theft of my downward spiral.
423560	432720	I call it Internet Historian's southward face in this drunk little town.
432720	437400	No more sugar for you!
437400	440880	Come along with me on my suicide world tour!
440880	443240	Is it five?
443240	444240	Yes!
444240	449640	Unfortunately, I recently discovered that Viacom also stole my spiral and I had to postpone
449640	451640	Harold's legal reckoning.
453680	455640	Were you recognized at VidCon?
455640	459800	I don't believe a single person at VidCon recognized me by looks alone.
460200	467020	Only through my voice and mutual friends could some people deduce who I was, and it was kind of fun surprising people like that.
467200	475040	It was also helpful not being instantly spotted in a crowd of people and being able to swap between getting noticed or staying incognito.
475040	478040	My name is Guy Incognito.
478200	480200	How uncomfortable are fan meetups?
480200	485840	So like I said earlier, I didn't really get openly recognized, so I didn't have to interact with many fans.
485840	491360	I will say that when it did happen, it's as uncomfortable as the fan wants to make it.
491360	497000	I gotta say that if any of you out there ever get the chance to meet me or any other YouTuber you like,
497080	503080	it's best to treat us like a normal person. Please don't grovel or worship the ground we stand on.
503240	506200	We're just regular people like you who happen to make videos.
506200	511920	I'm fine meeting fans in a quick and casual setting, but anything more than that tends to freak me out a bit.
512080	516560	Did you cover your face with those madness glasses like in the live SOTY podcast?
516560	522560	I was planning to because I thought it would make it easier for people to identify me, but unfortunately,
522560	526560	I left the madness at Mumpy Jones's house back when I visited in December.
526560	529760	You know what? Come to think of it, that actually explains a lot.
529760	532760	Oh, that's okay, Mumpy. I'm not hungry anymore.
536240	541440	Were the content creators that have genuine care for their videos promoted more by YouTube?
541440	544560	Or were generic obnoxious vloggers the main focus?
544560	546320	Yo, what's up, everybody?
546320	551360	It's interesting to look at which creators VidCon promote and which ones they tend to ignore.
551360	556560	While the stereotype of popular YouTubers does tend to be the obnoxious vlogger type,
556560	559920	it doesn't really reflect the promoted creators at VidCon.
559920	564720	People like Logan Paul and Tana Mongeau are rumored to have been banned from VidCon
564720	569120	and many ego-driven vlogger types seem to avoid the convention entirely.
569120	575200	At first, there doesn't really seem to be a clear reasoning for which online personalities are represented at VidCon.
575200	577280	There were a lot of storytime animators,
577280	583280	cooking channels, ASMR people, and many others in addition to the typical vloggers you'd expect.
583280	587120	Some of them are big and famous while others I had never heard of.
587120	590480	I talked about this with many people during my stay at the convention
590480	594480	and it starts to make more sense when you realize that a lot of these same creators
594480	597840	are the ones who consistently show up on the trending tab.
597840	603280	Now at this point, it's important to note that VidCon is run independently from YouTube.
603280	606560	While the convention is affiliated with YouTube's brand,
606560	610640	YouTube does not own or control what happens at VidCon.
610640	613440	So why then do we see the same people promoted?
613440	618080	Well, I believe the answer lies within marketability and controversiality.
618080	623920	All of the people you see promoted at VidCon tend to be very marketable and non-controversial.
623920	628080	Storytime animators are very popular among young teens and children,
628080	631920	which makes them very marketable to that valuable demographic.
631920	634240	Cooking channels are totally benign
634240	639360	and they most likely won't cause a political controversy that will cost the convention money.
639360	643600	Business-wise, this makes sense for a venue that wants to turn a profit.
643600	646960	Typically, no one from my neck of the woods gets any special treatment
646960	652320	because I tend to hang around people who are a little more outspoken about criticizing the establishment.
652320	658320	So it should be no surprise that we tend to be the ones who get labeled as unfriendly for advertisers.
658320	663600	It's the same reason why I don't see anyone like me getting invited to speak at these events anytime soon.
663600	665200	And yeah, it may feel unfair,
665200	670720	but it's important for us to not harbor resentment for those creators who do get favored by the system.
670720	672960	Don't hate the player, hit the game.
672960	674720	Is it really worth the money?
674720	681280	Now, considering the cost of air travel, hotels, food, convention tickets, and other expenses,
681280	686240	VidCon can easily run you over a thousand dollars depending on where you're coming from.
686240	690800	It seems like a steep price to pay for what amounts a little more than a networking trip.
690800	693840	Networking that's not even really guaranteed to happen.
693840	698960	In my opinion, by paying to go to VidCon, you're paying for the uniqueness of the event.
698960	701600	If you're a fan, then VidCon may be the only time
701600	705040	you can meet up with so many of your favorite channels in the same place.
705040	707760	If you're a creator, VidCon may be the only time
707760	711040	you can establish meaningful connections with so many of your peers.
711840	714720	If you're strapped for cash or struggling to make ends meet,
714720	717360	then you probably shouldn't spend that much on VidCon
717360	721440	because you're probably not going to see an immediate payout on that investment.
721440	725920	However, if you're working your way up the YouTube ranks and you have some savings to spare,
725920	730000	there's no other place where you can make friends with as many people in the community.
730560	734480	It's difficult to place monetary value on friendships and connections,
734480	737200	but in a highly cooperative setting like YouTube,
737200	740400	networking here is likely much more valuable than anywhere else.
745280	749520	Well, if you're speaking of people you dislike, then you'd call them clout chasers.
749520	752800	If you're speaking of people you like, then you'd call them opportunists.
753440	756800	I was able to meet and talk to a lot of big YouTubers at VidCon,
756800	761440	but the most insightful conversations I had were actually with small YouTubers.
761440	764480	Smaller creators are hungrier and they have a lot more to prove,
764480	766960	which forces them to take a lot more risks.
766960	769120	They can't just rely on following trends,
769120	772240	they have to be the ones experimenting and creating them.
772240	775840	VidCon is ripe with this mentality of hope and opportunity.
775840	778960	In the 1850s, people across the country dropped everything
778960	781440	to venture to California in search of gold.
781440	784560	The atmosphere of VidCon feels largely the same way.
787520	792960	This year's VidCon had a ton of memorable moments.
792960	796320	I got to meet a lot of new people, travel lots of new places,
796320	800480	I got to witness Rusty Cage's psychotic hot dog eating contest,
800480	804160	but for me, the moments I remember most are the simple ones.
804720	808000	My most memorable moment happened when I was sitting down on the couch
808000	810720	with Wang, Wavy Web Surf, and Willy Mac.
810720	815520	It was around 3 a.m., we were winding down from a big day of convention madness.
815600	818640	We're all talking about YouTube, looking forward to the future.
818640	821280	Just a bunch of guys from wildly different backgrounds
821280	824160	all united by the same camaraderie of making videos
824160	826640	for thousands of strangers on the internet.
826640	829520	Then one moment, I lean into them all and say,
829520	832560	that Gamer From Mars is an absolute savage.
832560	837040	This dude sponsored the downfall of ProJared with Vikings War of Clans.
837040	839280	He does not care about what you think.
839280	842320	He will beat you up, buy the rights to your video idea,
842320	844880	and sponsor it with Raid Shadow Legends.
844880	847040	This man is about to end all of our careers.
848240	851600	Attention all Epic gamers, this is the Gamer From Mars
851600	856080	letting you know that I've temporarily taken over Emperor Lemon's account.
856080	859360	Let this be a permanent reminder for all of you listening
859360	861440	not to talk about me behind my back
861440	865520	and also not to leave your computer unattended at VidCon.
865520	870720	But speaking of cyber security, this video is sponsored by NordVPN.
870720	873120	When traveling around on networking trips,
873120	877600	you're bound to connect to a lot of unsecure public Wi-Fi networks
877600	881120	which could leave your information vulnerable to hackers.
881120	883440	NordVPN encrypts your internet connection
883440	885920	so that you can stop worrying about your data
885920	887760	wherever you are in the world.
887760	895120	Be sure to visit nordvpn.com slash mplemon for 75% off the three-year plan.
895120	897040	I'll be giving up his account back now
897040	900400	in exchange of course for the revenue here and from this ad reading.
900960	904960	So now, please stay tuned for more regularly scheduled content.
905520	907360	And remember, if you mess with me
907360	910240	I will take away everything that you know and love.
930400	932400	Thank you for watching.
