00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:11,980
People of YouTube, welcome back to another edition of Emperor Lemons Summer Bummer.

2
00:00:11,980 --> 00:00:16,000
So this year I went to VidCon and I really didn't know what to expect.

3
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,040
I heard some good things, I heard some bad things, but most of all I was too lazy to

4
00:00:20,040 --> 00:00:22,480
actually research anything about it.

5
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:27,280
I joined up with local delinquent Rusty Cage and we ventured out of the gloomy swamps of

6
00:00:27,280 --> 00:00:30,760
Florida towards sunny Anaheim, California.

7
00:00:30,760 --> 00:00:33,440
What happened next may shock you.

8
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:40,960
VidCon is actually pretty freakin' epic.

9
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:45,480
Needless to say my expectations were blown totally out of the water and I wanted to make

10
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:47,800
a video sharing my experiences.

11
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:52,280
So I took to Twitter and had my fans submit questions about VidCon and hopefully after

12
00:00:52,280 --> 00:00:56,240
this video you'll all know a little bit more about it than I did going in.

13
00:00:56,240 --> 00:01:24,240
Well this sucks.

14
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:27,600
This is probably the number one question for most of you.

15
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:33,440
Is this whole place just infested with screaming kids and obnoxious egomaniacs?

16
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:34,940
Well not really.

17
00:01:34,940 --> 00:01:39,240
As far as conventions go the clientele at VidCon are pretty normal.

18
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:42,720
Far more normal than most conventions I've been to.

19
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:48,680
Like any big convention it's crowded and loud, there are vendors and giant screens.

20
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:53,920
So I guess if you don't like that then you're gonna have a bad time at VidCon and any other

21
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:54,920
convention.

22
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:59,080
Yeah there are a lot of kids but most of them I saw were under parental supervision.

23
00:01:59,080 --> 00:02:02,560
I didn't see any vloggers inciting riots either.

24
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:06,320
After just half an hour walking around the convention I realized that it's notoriety

25
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:17,680
had been cherry picked and exaggerated like many things on the internet.

26
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:22,400
This seemed to be another preconception of VidCon that it's all a big manipulative vanity

27
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:24,960
project for rich YouTubers to get richer.

28
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:28,480
I will admit that VidCon is a very corporate event.

29
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:32,320
There's a ton of brands and merchandising and marketing involved here.

30
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:36,080
But once again this is true for pretty much any big convention.

31
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:39,560
When you have a ton of people drawn to one place there's gonna be companies trying to

32
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:41,040
sell you stuff.

33
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:45,960
As for the YouTubers I would argue that VidCon does just as much to help grow small YouTubers

34
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:48,160
as it does to help big ones.

35
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:51,960
Small YouTubers certainly have much more to gain exposure wise.

36
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:53,660
VidCon already knows the big guys.

37
00:02:53,660 --> 00:02:58,240
It's the small unknown channels that can benefit the most from networking.

38
00:02:58,240 --> 00:03:02,600
As for the money I for one think it's great that TheOdd1sOut has hundreds of people waiting

39
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:04,360
in line to buy his merch.

40
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:09,140
Four years ago he was a nobody like most of you watching and now he's making bank.

41
00:03:09,140 --> 00:03:13,520
It's easy to hate on the rich and successful but we should celebrate that a guy like TheOdd1sOut

42
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:16,140
can even be rich and successful.

43
00:03:16,140 --> 00:03:21,520
Regular people can't just become a movie star or pro athlete or CEO in a few years but they

44
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:26,800
can become a successful YouTuber and I think we should appreciate how that's even possible.

45
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:31,600
But hey, that's just a theory.

46
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:35,840
What do you think about VidCon being owned by one of the biggest offenders of copyright

47
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:37,400
claim abuse?

48
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:38,840
Viacom.

49
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:45,360
I mentioned this in the last episode of YouTube Geographic but VidCon is in fact property

50
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:50,360
of Viacom, the most notorious copyright abuser in the history of YouTube.

51
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:54,480
Do I feel dirty about giving my hard-earned money to a company like Viacom?

52
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:56,120
Yeah, a little.

53
00:03:56,120 --> 00:04:00,640
But I would have felt about the same had I paid money to go to Disneyland right next door.

54
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:05,840
Apparently there was once a time when VidCon was a grassroots event run by YouTubers for

55
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:08,980
YouTubers, but that time has long since passed.

56
00:04:08,980 --> 00:04:13,720
Every growing property is doomed to be bought out by a bigger, blander entity.

57
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:15,480
That's just the way the world works.

58
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:19,360
Now I can't speak from experience but after hearing other YouTubers who attended the event

59
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:24,080
multiple years, the Viacom buyout did seem to make the event much more corporate and

60
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:29,760
sanitized than in prior years with a fairly heavy emphasis on marketing to children, which

61
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:31,140
is a shame.

62
00:04:31,140 --> 00:04:35,100
But then again, that's exactly the same thing YouTube has been doing so I guess it's somewhat

63
00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:36,260
fitting.

64
00:04:36,260 --> 00:04:40,960
Did the overall environment seem more geared towards networking and business ventures or

65
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:45,120
more towards entertainment value and giving guests a good time?

66
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:50,260
If I had to estimate, I'd say the vast majority of the VidCon audience are fans, so it's no

67
00:04:50,260 --> 00:04:53,500
surprise that the venue is designed to cater to them.

68
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:58,360
The primary selling point of VidCon is providing an opportunity for fans to meet their favorite

69
00:04:58,360 --> 00:04:59,400
YouTubers.

70
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:03,240
That's how I imagine they make most of their money, so they're obligated to invest more

71
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:05,400
in entertainment options.

72
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:09,680
That's not to say of course that there aren't any networking or business opportunities.

73
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:12,040
Those options are just far less intuitive.

74
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:15,920
I found that most of the networking at VidCon goes on independently from the convention

75
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:18,280
at bars or parties around town.

76
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:22,540
And I'm not saying that VidCon is totally useless in this aspect either.

77
00:05:22,540 --> 00:05:26,440
It's the spectacle of the convention that brings in all the creators.

78
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:30,200
You just have to make a lot of the networking happen on your own, which is why if you're

79
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:34,400
a creator and plan on going to VidCon, I'd recommend traveling in a group because the

80
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:38,680
more connections you have, the easier it becomes to network with others.

81
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:43,240
With all the drama YouTube personalities like to thrive off of, did you find it really

82
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:48,120
refreshing to meet and to know all these YouTubers aren't what they are online and more friendly

83
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:49,120
in person?

84
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:53,520
I gotta say, the best part of VidCon for me was getting to meet and hang out with a bunch

85
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:56,720
of great YouTubers who I've been watching for years.

86
00:05:56,720 --> 00:06:00,480
It was a little bit disorienting at first because I was only used to seeing these guys

87
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:01,960
on screen.

88
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:06,240
Looking at all these YouTubers in the same place felt like a fever dream at first, but

89
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:08,640
eventually it was like hanging out with friends.

90
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:10,600
Or maybe even beyond that.

91
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:15,220
Sometimes when watching videos we lose sight of the fact that YouTubers are just people.

92
00:06:15,220 --> 00:06:19,520
Really interesting, unique, and creative people who are all connected by the simple passion

93
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:21,400
of creating content.

94
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:26,300
And I'm normally not one to enjoy parties or big social events, but talking to people

95
00:06:26,300 --> 00:06:31,360
at VidCon just felt so easy for me, something I've never really experienced before.

96
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:36,200
It just felt so great to complain about getting demonetized without having to spend 15 minutes

97
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:37,960
explaining what that means.

98
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:41,280
It was definitely the most valuable part of VidCon for me.

99
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:44,480
Did you see Internet Historian's face?

100
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:49,160
Yes, I was able to witness the enigmatic mystery of the Internet Historian.

101
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:53,000
And to no one's surprise, he looks exactly like his online avatar.

102
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:57,160
Once I confirmed his identity, I was able to send my team of highly paid lawyers to

103
00:06:57,160 --> 00:07:03,560
his home in Dinosaur Island to demand retribution for his blatant theft of my downward spiral.

104
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:12,720
I call it Internet Historian's southward face in this drunk little town.

105
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:17,400
No more sugar for you!

106
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:20,880
Come along with me on my suicide world tour!

107
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:23,240
Is it five?

108
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:24,240
Yes!

109
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:29,640
Unfortunately, I recently discovered that Viacom also stole my spiral and I had to postpone

110
00:07:29,640 --> 00:07:31,640
Harold's legal reckoning.

111
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:35,640
Were you recognized at VidCon?

112
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:39,800
I don't believe a single person at VidCon recognized me by looks alone.

113
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:47,020
Only through my voice and mutual friends could some people deduce who I was, and it was kind of fun surprising people like that.

114
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:55,040
It was also helpful not being instantly spotted in a crowd of people and being able to swap between getting noticed or staying incognito.

115
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:58,040
My name is Guy Incognito.

116
00:07:58,200 --> 00:08:00,200
How uncomfortable are fan meetups?

117
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:05,840
So like I said earlier, I didn't really get openly recognized, so I didn't have to interact with many fans.

118
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:11,360
I will say that when it did happen, it's as uncomfortable as the fan wants to make it.

119
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:17,000
I gotta say that if any of you out there ever get the chance to meet me or any other YouTuber you like,

120
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:23,080
it's best to treat us like a normal person. Please don't grovel or worship the ground we stand on.

121
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:26,200
We're just regular people like you who happen to make videos.

122
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:31,920
I'm fine meeting fans in a quick and casual setting, but anything more than that tends to freak me out a bit.

123
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:36,560
Did you cover your face with those madness glasses like in the live SOTY podcast?

124
00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:42,560
I was planning to because I thought it would make it easier for people to identify me, but unfortunately,

125
00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:46,560
I left the madness at Mumpy Jones's house back when I visited in December.

126
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:49,760
You know what? Come to think of it, that actually explains a lot.

127
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:52,760
Oh, that's okay, Mumpy. I'm not hungry anymore.

128
00:08:56,240 --> 00:09:01,440
Were the content creators that have genuine care for their videos promoted more by YouTube?

129
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:04,560
Or were generic obnoxious vloggers the main focus?

130
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:06,320
Yo, what's up, everybody?

131
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:11,360
It's interesting to look at which creators VidCon promote and which ones they tend to ignore.

132
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:16,560
While the stereotype of popular YouTubers does tend to be the obnoxious vlogger type,

133
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:19,920
it doesn't really reflect the promoted creators at VidCon.

134
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:24,720
People like Logan Paul and Tana Mongeau are rumored to have been banned from VidCon

135
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:29,120
and many ego-driven vlogger types seem to avoid the convention entirely.

136
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:35,200
At first, there doesn't really seem to be a clear reasoning for which online personalities are represented at VidCon.

137
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:37,280
There were a lot of storytime animators,

138
00:09:37,280 --> 00:09:43,280
cooking channels, ASMR people, and many others in addition to the typical vloggers you'd expect.

139
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:47,120
Some of them are big and famous while others I had never heard of.

140
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:50,480
I talked about this with many people during my stay at the convention

141
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:54,480
and it starts to make more sense when you realize that a lot of these same creators

142
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:57,840
are the ones who consistently show up on the trending tab.

143
00:09:57,840 --> 00:10:03,280
Now at this point, it's important to note that VidCon is run independently from YouTube.

144
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:06,560
While the convention is affiliated with YouTube's brand,

145
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:10,640
YouTube does not own or control what happens at VidCon.

146
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:13,440
So why then do we see the same people promoted?

147
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:18,080
Well, I believe the answer lies within marketability and controversiality.

148
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:23,920
All of the people you see promoted at VidCon tend to be very marketable and non-controversial.

149
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:28,080
Storytime animators are very popular among young teens and children,

150
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:31,920
which makes them very marketable to that valuable demographic.

151
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:34,240
Cooking channels are totally benign

152
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:39,360
and they most likely won't cause a political controversy that will cost the convention money.

153
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:43,600
Business-wise, this makes sense for a venue that wants to turn a profit.

154
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:46,960
Typically, no one from my neck of the woods gets any special treatment

155
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:52,320
because I tend to hang around people who are a little more outspoken about criticizing the establishment.

156
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:58,320
So it should be no surprise that we tend to be the ones who get labeled as unfriendly for advertisers.

157
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:03,600
It's the same reason why I don't see anyone like me getting invited to speak at these events anytime soon.

158
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:05,200
And yeah, it may feel unfair,

159
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:10,720
but it's important for us to not harbor resentment for those creators who do get favored by the system.

160
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:12,960
Don't hate the player, hit the game.

161
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:14,720
Is it really worth the money?

162
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:21,280
Now, considering the cost of air travel, hotels, food, convention tickets, and other expenses,

163
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:26,240
VidCon can easily run you over a thousand dollars depending on where you're coming from.

164
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:30,800
It seems like a steep price to pay for what amounts a little more than a networking trip.

165
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:33,840
Networking that's not even really guaranteed to happen.

166
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:38,960
In my opinion, by paying to go to VidCon, you're paying for the uniqueness of the event.

167
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:41,600
If you're a fan, then VidCon may be the only time

168
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:45,040
you can meet up with so many of your favorite channels in the same place.

169
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:47,760
If you're a creator, VidCon may be the only time

170
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:51,040
you can establish meaningful connections with so many of your peers.

171
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:54,720
If you're strapped for cash or struggling to make ends meet,

172
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:57,360
then you probably shouldn't spend that much on VidCon

173
00:11:57,360 --> 00:12:01,440
because you're probably not going to see an immediate payout on that investment.

174
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:05,920
However, if you're working your way up the YouTube ranks and you have some savings to spare,

175
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:10,000
there's no other place where you can make friends with as many people in the community.

176
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:14,480
It's difficult to place monetary value on friendships and connections,

177
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:17,200
but in a highly cooperative setting like YouTube,

178
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:20,400
networking here is likely much more valuable than anywhere else.

179
00:12:25,280 --> 00:12:29,520
Well, if you're speaking of people you dislike, then you'd call them clout chasers.

180
00:12:29,520 --> 00:12:32,800
If you're speaking of people you like, then you'd call them opportunists.

181
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:36,800
I was able to meet and talk to a lot of big YouTubers at VidCon,

182
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:41,440
but the most insightful conversations I had were actually with small YouTubers.

183
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:44,480
Smaller creators are hungrier and they have a lot more to prove,

184
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:46,960
which forces them to take a lot more risks.

185
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:49,120
They can't just rely on following trends,

186
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:52,240
they have to be the ones experimenting and creating them.

187
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:55,840
VidCon is ripe with this mentality of hope and opportunity.

188
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:58,960
In the 1850s, people across the country dropped everything

189
00:12:58,960 --> 00:13:01,440
to venture to California in search of gold.

190
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:04,560
The atmosphere of VidCon feels largely the same way.

191
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:12,960
This year's VidCon had a ton of memorable moments.

192
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:16,320
I got to meet a lot of new people, travel lots of new places,

193
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:20,480
I got to witness Rusty Cage's psychotic hot dog eating contest,

194
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:24,160
but for me, the moments I remember most are the simple ones.

195
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:28,000
My most memorable moment happened when I was sitting down on the couch

196
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,720
with Wang, Wavy Web Surf, and Willy Mac.

197
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:35,520
It was around 3 a.m., we were winding down from a big day of convention madness.

198
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:38,640
We're all talking about YouTube, looking forward to the future.

199
00:13:38,640 --> 00:13:41,280
Just a bunch of guys from wildly different backgrounds

200
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:44,160
all united by the same camaraderie of making videos

201
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:46,640
for thousands of strangers on the internet.

202
00:13:46,640 --> 00:13:49,520
Then one moment, I lean into them all and say,

203
00:13:49,520 --> 00:13:52,560
that Gamer From Mars is an absolute savage.

204
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:57,040
This dude sponsored the downfall of ProJared with Vikings War of Clans.

205
00:13:57,040 --> 00:13:59,280
He does not care about what you think.

206
00:13:59,280 --> 00:14:02,320
He will beat you up, buy the rights to your video idea,

207
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:04,880
and sponsor it with Raid Shadow Legends.

208
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:07,040
This man is about to end all of our careers.

209
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:11,600
Attention all Epic gamers, this is the Gamer From Mars

210
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:16,080
letting you know that I've temporarily taken over Emperor Lemon's account.

211
00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:19,360
Let this be a permanent reminder for all of you listening

212
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:21,440
not to talk about me behind my back

213
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:25,520
and also not to leave your computer unattended at VidCon.

214
00:14:25,520 --> 00:14:30,720
But speaking of cyber security, this video is sponsored by NordVPN.

215
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:33,120
When traveling around on networking trips,

216
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:37,600
you're bound to connect to a lot of unsecure public Wi-Fi networks

217
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:41,120
which could leave your information vulnerable to hackers.

218
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:43,440
NordVPN encrypts your internet connection

219
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:45,920
so that you can stop worrying about your data

220
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:47,760
wherever you are in the world.

221
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:55,120
Be sure to visit nordvpn.com slash mplemon for 75% off the three-year plan.

222
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:57,040
I'll be giving up his account back now

223
00:14:57,040 --> 00:15:00,400
in exchange of course for the revenue here and from this ad reading.

224
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:04,960
So now, please stay tuned for more regularly scheduled content.

225
00:15:05,520 --> 00:15:07,360
And remember, if you mess with me

226
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:10,240
I will take away everything that you know and love.

227
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:32,400
Thank you for watching.
