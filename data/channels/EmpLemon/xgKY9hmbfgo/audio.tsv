0	9360	In my last video, I talked about The Wizard of Oz, a work of art so beloved that it overshadowed the horrifying gauntlet of trauma endured by its cast and crew.
9360	17160	The studio behind the film was MGM, a company that for generations single-handedly carried the film industry on its back.
17160	22160	Decades later, you could have said the same thing about Nintendo and the video game industry.
22320	25920	In 1983, the US video game market crashed.
25920	31000	In just two years, industry revenue had plummeted by more than 95%.
31000	39400	Atari, the leading American games manufacturer, was forced to bury more than 700,000 unsold cartridges in a New Mexico landfill.
39400	46360	The state of the video game industry was in shambles, providing ample opportunity for one Japanese company to pick up the pieces.
46360	60240	In 1985, Nintendo released the NES in the United States, a console that rejuvenated consumer confidence in gaming.
60240	66320	In its darkest hour, the video game industry was rescued by a mystical company from a faraway land.
66320	69760	Many fans of gaming have come to see it as a miracle.
69760	79120	By 1988, the NES accounted for a 70% share of the video game market, and the industry was poised for its most prosperous period yet.
79120	83600	Nintendo inherited the exalted title, The Savior of Video Games.
83600	89120	Now, nearly 40 years and six consoles later, the warship is far from over.
99760	108720	Modern-day disciples of Nintendo span a variety of denominations.
108720	113360	Together, they form one of the most loyal followings for any brand in the world.
113360	121360	However, despite the daily outpouring of reverence and adoration Nintendo receives from its fans, the sentiment is far from mutual.
121360	123680	Recently, it's been quite the opposite.
123760	131280	In fact, the past 20 years have shown us that Nintendo's most passionate supporters often wind up becoming their most forsaken.
131280	135280	Last year, I posted a video about Hungrybox and competitive Melee.
135280	142880	It's a video that features many layers of conflict, one of which was Nintendo's antagonistic relationship with competitive Smash.
142880	155680	Super Smash Bros. was never designed to be anything other than a party game, but developer intentions wouldn't stop some players from reinventing the game in their own vision.
155680	162880	The rushed development of Melee led to a series of engine exploits which pushed the skill ceiling of the game to the limits of human ability.
162880	166880	But it was so frame perfect, I felt like literally an explosion in my hand.
166880	176080	These unique mechanics transformed the game into a competitive spectacle and one of the first video games in America showcased in sanctioned esports tournaments.
176080	183680	MLG hosted Melee tournaments as far back as 2004, predating even the earliest Call of Duty championships.
183680	192080	At the time, the esports industry was still in its infancy and Super Smash Bros. was in prime position to lead competitive gaming into a new era.
192080	197680	Unfortunately, Nintendo wasn't on board with the idea of their game being played competitively at all.
197680	204480	Lead developer Masahiro Sakurai made it his mission to all but erase competitive play in the next installment of the series.
204480	206880	No contest!
206880	211280	Melee's defining mechanics were neutered if not outright removed in its sequel.
211280	217680	A deliberate design decision by the developers who feared that Melee's competitiveness was intimidating new players.
217680	226880	Considering that Melee was the best-selling game on its system, it's tough to justify that wavedashing had any effect on casual players' reception towards the franchise.
226880	233680	Across all of gaming, it's very unusual for the skill ceiling of a game to actually affect the enjoyment of new players.
233680	240880	Even games as simple as Tetris and chess see highly competitive top players utilizing extremely advanced strategy.
240880	244080	Yet they remain two of the most played games in history.
244080	250080	In Melee, the competitive community at the time only represented a miniscule fraction of the total players.
250080	255280	And it's very likely that the vast majority of Nintendo's customers didn't even know they existed.
255280	263680	The company's insistence on specifically punishing competitive play is truly bizarre and possibly unprecedented among the entire industry.
263680	272880	In the end though, dynamic and nuanced play was sacrificed to appease the casual player base who in all likelihood would have still enjoyed the game regardless.
272880	282880	Removing competitive techniques from future titles is one thing, but deliberately sabotaging competitors from enjoying an existing game is a whole other level of petty.
282880	291280	MLG's original run with Melee ended after 2006, but it was originally supposed to continue into 2007 and beyond.
291280	299280	The organization was allegedly pressured by Nintendo to drop Melee from its pro circuit so as to not interfere with the release of Brawl.
299280	310480	While other esports at the time were beginning to prosper, competitive Melee was subject to a dark age that would persist until 2013 when the community raised enough money to earn a spot at EVO.
310480	320080	Of course, Nintendo infamously tried to revoke EVO's rights to stream the event, a decision so unpopular that they were forced to back down less than 24 hours later.
320080	326480	This incident has been heavily publicized, but it wasn't the first time Nintendo tried to black out a Smash tournament.
326480	334480	In 2010, MLG hosted their one and only tournament for Brawl, a tournament that was never seen by anyone outside of the venue.
334480	343680	Nintendo refused to allow MLG to stream the event, and unlike the case with Melee a few years later, Brawl's stream was never reinstated.
343680	350080	Nintendo's contempt for competitive play is something not seen by practically any other big name game developer.
350080	362080	It's common practice in the industry today for developers to bankroll big tournament pots, because it's fairly well understood that a healthy competitive scene contributes to a more engaging product for all players.
362080	370880	While competitors in most esports bask in $100,000 prize pools, Smash players have to act graciously for simply being allowed to play at all.
370880	376880	Nintendo is not just indifferent to competitive Smash, oftentimes they are actively malicious.
376880	384880	2013 saw the release of Project M, a modded version of Brawl which combined its existing roster with Melee's mechanics.
384880	392080	Over the next couple years, Project M tournaments grew in popularity to be on par with Melee in viewership and attendance.
392080	399280	Then, at the end of 2015, the mod was suddenly and mysteriously abandoned by both developers and tournament organizers.
399280	410080	Years later, it was revealed that at the time Nintendo was toying around with sponsoring an official competitive circuit, but mandated that Project M be discarded before moving forward.
410080	420680	Despite support from major entities like Twitch and Red Bull, Nintendo strung the community along for three years before dumping the prospect altogether upon the release of Smash Ultimate.
420680	427080	Smash would never end up getting an official pro circuit, and Project M was sacrificed for nothing.
427080	439880	By the beginning of 2020, the Smash community had finally secured enough funds to arrange their own competitive circuit independent of Nintendo, but well, some things are just never meant to work out.
439880	453080	Even amidst the depths of the pandemic, the passion for competitive Smash still persisted through online tournaments, but even then, Nintendo had to rear its head and punish a community who had everything else taken from them.
453080	465080	The Big House 2020 was cancelled because online play necessitated the use of a modded version of Melee run on an emulator, and so, the players of Melee were stripped of their last solitary means of competition.
465080	468080	What more can you take away from me?
468080	479080	The Smash community is generally not well liked by the majority of observers. Last year's firestorm of allegations and controversy among top community figures certainly didn't help.
479080	489080	The public's perception of the esport has likely been tarnished beyond repair, and many people remain adamantly unsympathetic over the plight of competitive Smash.
489080	498080	However, understanding Nintendo's treatment of its esports competitors provides us with insight into how they tend to respond to any conflict of interest with their fans.
498080	507080	Even back in the days of MLG, what Nintendo did to the Smash community set the tone for how they would treat their most diehard supporters moving forward.
510080	520080	As time marches on, video game hardware gradually degrades and stops functioning. Among would-be players, hardware deterioration creates an issue of accessibility.
520080	527080	For many, the solution to this issue lies in emulation, and no company despises emulation more than Nintendo.
527080	529080	This is illegal, you know.
529080	535080	There's a prevailing misconception among the general public that emulating games in and of itself is illegal.
535080	547080	However, a series of court decisions during the 90s and early 2000s ruled that the act of emulation is totally permissible by law, upholding that video game companies are not entitled to a monopoly.
547080	555080	Where the legal issues arise is the distribution of digital game files, which does fall into the realm of copyright infringement.
556080	566080	The YouTuber Narrow made a trilogy of videos discussing everything you need to know about emulation, which I highly recommend watching in order to gain a full understanding of the situation.
566080	575080	But to summarize, a substantial portion of ROM sharing is done so out of necessity, by people who have no other means of obtaining games through legitimate methods.
575080	581080	Obscurity, rights issues, and region locking make some titles remarkably difficult to acquire.
581080	587080	When consumers are willing and able to pay for a product, it's up to existing services to fulfill those needs.
587080	595080	When services fail to offer desired products, consumers have no choice but to obtain them through piracy or other black market means.
595080	602080	Most game companies understand this and offer ample opportunity for consumers to easily experience retro titles.
602080	612080	Nintendo, on the other hand, despite being the most adamantly outspoken about emulationist theft, is noticeably lacking in providing any legal alternative to many of their titles.
612080	626080	Nintendo's online retro libraries release games at a snail's pace, and by the time a console reaches the end of its lifespan, its existing library becomes unavailable, forcing consumers to restart their digital collection on the following system.
626080	632080	This process creates sizable lapse periods where would-be customers are unable to access their favorite retro games.
632080	638080	Even Nintendo's dedicated retro hardware like the NES Classic suffered notorious supply shortages.
638080	646080	Many have inferred that restricting their supply of classic games is a deliberate strategy by Nintendo to artificially drive up demand.
646080	654080	To make matters worse, Nintendo's official retro experience tends to lack many of the basic features that were available on emulators as far back as the 90s.
654080	665080	Perhaps if the company spent as much effort improving their own retro offerings as they do litigating the passionate fans who make better alternatives, there wouldn't be as much of an underground market to litigate.
665080	678080	Market is not even an accurate term, considering how practically all ROMs and emulators are distributed with no intention of earning revenue, but that doesn't stop Nintendo from suing many of these people for millions of dollars that they never made.
678080	690080	It's widely understood among copyright experts that ROM libraries such as Console Classics are perfectly legal, since they lend out a limited supply of ROMs that each correspond to a physical copy that they own.
690080	697080	However, despite taking every precaution they could, Console Classics still had to deal with Nintendo's bullying and intimidation.
697080	705080	The Amularity Games library notably excludes Nintendo games from their collection because of the company's cutthroat reputation.
705080	714080	The exclusion serves as a stark reminder of how in the present day, Nintendo is the only major game company belligerent enough to continue punishing emulation.
714080	724080	And yes, Nintendo has the legal right to do so, just like how music companies have the legal right to ruin someone's life for downloading some songs off the internet.
724080	731080	Longtime viewers of the channel know exactly what I think about the utter nonsense that is modern copyright legislation.
731080	738080	So if you want to convince me of Nintendo's righteous virtue in this situation, you're going to have to justify it with something a bit more compelling than
738080	741080	THAT'S HOW THE LAW WORKS
741080	750080	Where Nintendo starts to enter truly egregious territories through its treatment of mods and fangames.
750080	760080	I've already talked about the tragic downfall of Project M, but that was simply a drop in the bucket compared to the immense scale of Nintendo's warpath against fan-made projects.
760080	770080	In 2016, Nintendo issued cease and desists on over 500 fangames, two of which included the highly anticipated Pokémon Uranium and AM2R.
770080	777080	Both of these projects represented a labor of love that took developers thousands of hours of their own free time to complete,
777080	782080	and Nintendo's response to all of that effort and talent was to stomp it into the dust.
783080	791080	It may be tough to understand why Nintendo is so ruthless about guarding their intellectual property, but the answer can be found in the company's history.
791080	797080	Back in the 80s, Nintendo made it their mission to undo the industry mistakes, which led to the crash.
797080	804080	Consumers had lost faith in video games because the market had become flooded with low-quality cash grabs and bootlegs.
804080	812080	Nintendo implemented their seal of quality as a necessary measure for consumers to distinguish their quality products from cheap knockoffs.
812080	819080	Today, the industry has vastly changed, but Nintendo's primal fear of rogue imitators has never left them.
819080	824080	It's a fear that can now be described as irrational and detrimental to the industry as a whole.
824080	830080	Video games have long since surpassed film and music as the biggest entertainment industry in the world.
830080	837080	Suffice to say, the gaming industry is no longer teetering on the brink of outright collapse from some teenager making a ROM hack.
837080	845080	Since Nintendo's heyday, modding and fan-made adaptations have actually contributed to some of the most celebrated games of all time.
845080	849080	Valve built their entire game library off a modded version of the Quake engine.
849080	857080	Developer John Carmack released the source code for anyone to use, the fruits of which resulted in some of the most influential games of their era.
857080	865080	Today, Valve has repaid the favor to the next generation of programmers who are allowed to buy and sell modded Valve games on their own platform.
865080	873080	These days, it's safe to say that modding is not just an accepted part of the industry, but a necessity in innovating the genre as a whole.
873080	878080	If John Carmack acted like Nintendo, the gaming industry would have been set back by years.
879080	889080	It's relatively rare for modern game companies to police fans creating mods of their games, but it's nearly unthinkable for companies to police fans creating videos of their games.
889080	896080	So have you ever noticed how most Nintendo YouTubers only seem to start popping into existence about four years ago?
896080	903080	Well, there's a very important reason for that, because in the early 2010s, being a Nintendo YouTuber was completely infeasible.
903080	914080	Last year, Google Stadia creative director Alex Hutchinson posted a tweet suggesting that streamers and content creators pay a fee to game publishers for the privilege of having others watch them play.
914080	920080	This post got absolutely ratioed out of the ballpark. I mean, really, what a totally asinine statement.
920080	925080	Can you actually imagine how dystopian it would be if companies actually did this?
926080	930080	Except, one company has done this. Nintendo.
930080	934080	At one point, it was actually worse than even what this guy suggested.
934080	939080	In 2013, Nintendo Content ID claimed all footage of their games on YouTube.
939080	945080	If you used even a fraction of Nintendo gameplay, that video wouldn't earn you a dime.
945080	952080	It turns out that punishing everyone who makes videos about your games is a good way to ensure that no one makes videos about your games.
952080	961080	As YouTube Let's Plays exploded in popularity at around the same time, Nintendo began to realize that their decision was costing them millions in potential free advertising.
961080	968080	So in 2015, they sheepishly restored content creators' ability to earn revenue, this time taking a 30% cut.
968080	979080	However, in order to get your 70% share, you were forced to manually apply to their partner programs so they could micromanage your channel and make sure that you didn't step out of line from their standards.
979080	989080	This policy persisted for more than three years before Nintendo finally scrapped it and allowed content creators to do what literally every other game publisher was fine with the whole time.
989080	996080	Nintendo is such an utterly baffling company to me because the hard part of running a game studio comes so easy to them.
996080	1000080	They can pump out masterpiece after masterpiece without breaking a sweat.
1000080	1003080	As far as I can tell, they treat their employees quite well.
1003080	1008080	It's just the simple no-brainer public relations tasks that seem to utterly escape them.
1008080	1016080	If EA or Blizzard or Sony or Epic Games did just some of the things Nintendo do on a regular basis, you'd never hear the end of it.
1016080	1021080	What makes Nintendo any different? How do they keep getting away with it?
1021080	1027080	Well, the main difference between Nintendo and all of these other companies comes down to one factor, the fans.
1028080	1035080	Go back and grow up. But I'm warning you, once you're grown up, you can never come back.
1038080	1043080	I understand that for some people, Nintendo is more than just some company that makes good games.
1043080	1046080	Whole generations of people grew up with them.
1046080	1054080	Many saw Nintendo as a defining part of their childhood and have absorbed the company and its characters as an integral piece of their identity.
1054080	1059080	For some, Nintendo evokes profound nostalgia for simpler, happier days.
1059080	1063080	For others, it represents a refuge from the abuse and torment of their reality.
1063080	1070080	You'd be hard-pressed to find any other brand that can summon such powerful feelings of vulnerable, youthful innocence.
1070080	1076080	I'm not here to disparage people for being passionate about something they truly and unabashedly love.
1076080	1082080	But recognizing the zealous loyalty of the Nintendo fanbase is a necessary step in diagnosing the problem.
1085080	1086080	Here's the problem!
1086080	1094080	After 40 years of making such beloved games, Nintendo has spawned a following of apostles who worship the company with religious dedication.
1094080	1098080	It's not enough for them to simply engage with the products.
1098080	1103080	The most devout Nintendo fans have an obligation to make their faith known to all who encounter them.
1103080	1110080	Such ardent loyalty to some faraway corporation is highly abnormal, and it leads to highly abnormal outcomes.
1110080	1119080	Nintendo is certainly aware of the immense goodwill which their customers share, and rather than reciprocate it, they have harnessed it and are currently riding it all the way to the bank.
1119080	1128080	They're confident that they can get away with almost anything because a substantial portion of their audience have adopted the dogmatic belief that the company is incapable of sin.
1128080	1134080	Recently, there have been prevailing discussions online about the toxicity of fandoms in stand culture.
1134080	1142080	And while the same few notorious subcultures get brought up over and over again, I rarely see anyone mention the Nintendo fandom in these conversations.
1142080	1150080	In my experience, the most extreme Nintendo fans are as psychotic and maladjusted as any other fandom, and I'm tired of pretending that they're not.
1150080	1157080	I always imagine that Nintendo doesn't have to pay a PR team to run damage control because their fans will do it for them.
1157080	1165080	It seems that no matter how low the company stoops, it will always have a human shield of fanboys lining up to make excuses for them.
1165080	1171080	The most diehard fans are so quick to forget about the company's misdeeds that you'd think they have amnesia.
1171080	1174080	At the end of last year, Nintendo got into some hot water.
1174080	1183080	In the span of a few weeks, they shut down Melee's biggest online event, shut down a Splatoon tournament when those players stood in solidarity with the Melee players,
1183080	1187080	and shut down the charitable sale of Joy-Cons honoring the late Etika.
1187080	1192080	Three days later, they unveiled Sephiroth in Ultimate, and all the backlash magically disappeared.
1192080	1203080	When I pointed this out on Twitter, I spent the next week getting bombarded with apoplectic responses of how much of an idiot I was for thinking that Nintendo fans would actually express displeasure to the company.
1203080	1206080	Wow, what an awful take. How foolish of me.
1206080	1213080	When have people ever protested a company's recent actions by pressing dislike on their totally unrelated YouTube videos?
1213080	1214080	Well actually...
1214080	1220080	October 2019, Blizzard bans Hearthstone player Blitzchung for making pro-Hong Kong comments.
1220080	1224080	Their subsequent unrelated YouTube videos are heavily disliked.
1224080	1230080	November 2018, Fallout 76 launches as a buggy, unplayable disaster.
1230080	1233080	Bethesda gets ratioed on unrelated videos.
1233080	1239080	November 2017, EA reveals much-hated loot crates will be a part of Battlefront 2.
1239080	1240080	Ratio.
1240080	1245080	August 2016, No Man's Sky grossly underdelivers upon release.
1245080	1246080	Ratio.
1246080	1250080	Hmm, now where did I get this absolutely bonkers idea again?
1250080	1252080	This lady is a judge!
1254080	1260080	I was never trying to argue that spamming dislikes on developer videos is an effective means of instigating change.
1260080	1262080	I'm not even arguing that it's justifiable.
1262080	1271080	My point with all of this was that ratioing videos is a simple and direct way for consumers to publicly express their disapproval towards a company.
1271080	1277080	And recent history shows us that this is the natural response to controversy in the gaming industry.
1277080	1284080	The notable absence of dislikes on Nintendo's video after the controversy says to me that the backlash never really existed.
1284080	1290080	All that himming and hawing in the moment was superficial and couldn't have reflected anyone's true convictions.
1290080	1296080	Because the second Nintendo jangled a shiny set of keys in front of the fans, everyone seemed to forgive and forget.
1296080	1308080	The Nintendo Brigade was quick to jump down my throat to lecture me about how a video posted to Nintendo's YouTube channel featuring a best-selling Nintendo franchise somehow exists irrespective to Nintendo as a business.
1308080	1320080	Many tried to make the complete non-sacruder argument that disliking a YouTube video is somehow equivalent to taking food off of Sakurai's dinner plate, with one person comparing Sakurai to a hapless Walmart employee.
1320080	1323080	Okay, so that's how it's gonna be.
1323080	1325080	Y'all wanna play?
1325080	1336080	Ignoring the fact that this post isn't even directed at Sakurai, trying to frame him as an independent bystander to the big bad legal team above him is painfully naive and factually wrong.
1336080	1347080	So many people try to compartmentalize all of Nintendo's nasty practices as the work of just a few dastardly lawyers, in a desperate attempt to salvage the company's spotless image in their minds.
1347080	1352080	This may come off as a newsflash to some of you, but every corporation has a legal department.
1352080	1356080	Every corporation is confronted with threats to their intellectual property.
1356080	1361080	Very few corporations choose to respond to these problems as viciously as Nintendo.
1361080	1369080	Very few companies use mafioso tactics to harass and intimidate people who wound up on the wrong side of their terms of service.
1369080	1374080	Very few companies rig their country's legal system to threaten video game modders with jail time.
1374080	1385080	Nintendo is starting to resemble a tyrant that's gone mad with power, and their draconian disregard for the public good runs a hell of a lot deeper than a couple of bad apples on their legal team.
1385080	1388080	Every decision any company makes comes straight from the top.
1388080	1395080	And as hard as it may be for some of you to believe, Sakurai is a hell of a lot closer to the top than the alternative.
1395080	1401080	Lots of people try to obfuscate his role in the company by stipulating that he is not technically a Nintendo employee.
1401080	1412080	This point is completely irrelevant when you consider how Sakurai's actions directly influenced the bottom line of the company, and how his entire career trajectory was dictated by Nintendo's success.
1412080	1418080	He is the spokesperson for Super Smash Bros. By definition, he represents the views of the company.
1418080	1419080	Hello?
1419080	1424080	Just like those oh-so-nefarious lawyers, it is his job to tow the company line.
1425080	1433080	He oversaw two of Nintendo's flagship franchises for decades. He had the opportunity to make Smash better for competitive players, and he didn't.
1433080	1439080	He had the opportunity to speak out against Nintendo's increasingly slimy business decisions, and he didn't.
1439080	1448080	To claim in any way that Sakurai somehow exists in a vacuum, completely free of Nintendo's influence, demonstrates a complete ignorance towards the nature of business.
1448080	1453080	But hey, who am I to dare commit sacrilege against one of Nintendo's prodigal sons?
1453080	1460080	If Nintendo is God, Sakura and all their other spokespeople are Jesus Christ, and have been idolized as such.
1460080	1465080	You're not allowed to criticize them, and you're especially not allowed to undermine their supreme authority.
1465080	1472080	When Nintendo does all that anti-consumer stuff, they're just operating within their fair and justifiable legal right.
1472080	1478080	But pressing dislike on a Sakurai video? Now that's just cruel. Who would even consider doing such a thing?
1478080	1489080	Eleven months before this, the Nintendo fandom actually decided to make use of the dislike button to protest the addition of Byleth to Smash Ultimate.
1489080	1493080	And they didn't seem to be too concerned over Sakurai's feelings here.
1493080	1500080	Blatant double standards aside, it's somewhat enlightening to realize where the Nintendo fandom's priorities actually lie.
1501080	1506080	Complaining about an optional DLC sword fighter in a game with 80 other characters.
1506080	1510080	I can't help but think that some of these people exist in Neverland.
1510080	1513080	Tangible problems in our world don't concern them.
1513080	1518080	Only when their whimsical wonderland is disrupted do they show the slightest signs of resistance.
1518080	1524080	Fortunately for Nintendo, pacifying the mob is as simple as unveiling the next shiny new toy.
1524080	1527080	And therein lies the ultimate problem.
1527080	1533080	There was once a time where enough people would object to Nintendo's decisions and the company could actually be convinced to listen.
1533080	1541080	Now we've reached a point where the militant worship of the company is drowning out dissenting voices in practically all cases of controversy.
1541080	1549080	All of us are left to reap the consequences of a company who knows their audience will tolerate anything they do as long as the product on screen is good enough.
1549080	1555080	They can charge 20 bucks a year for a barely functional online service that was free on prior systems.
1555080	1562080	They can charge 80 bucks for controllers with such significant defects that they make many games borderline unplayable.
1562080	1566080	They can release reskins of games that cost more than the originals.
1566080	1571080	They can arbitrarily limit the release window of games for no other reason than to jack up the price.
1571080	1577080	They can force customers to purchase an additional console if they want to create a second island in Animal Crossing.
1577080	1583080	At what point will Nintendo cross the line to where the customer is no longer willing to get ripped off?
1583080	1589080	Fortunately, Nintendo has the most loyal fans in the world, and that line is nowhere in sight.
1589080	1595080	Eh, I will still buy shit from them. I couldn't give less of a crap to the free melee thing.
1595080	1602080	That's the problem! You don't give a damn! And my problem is I care too much!
1602080	1608080	Also, what the hell you are calling Nintendo consumers pathetic? Am I pathetic for having a Switch?
1608080	1610080	Yes!
1610080	1619080	In the Church of Nintendo, the most adoring followers make the best sacrifices, and as time goes on, the untouchable deity only grows more hungry.
1619080	1626080	The sad reality is that the solution to Nintendo's problems rests on the shoulders of the people least likely to do anything about them.
1626080	1631080	I get the impression that many of Nintendo's followers somehow feel indebted to the company,
1631080	1637080	as if spending their hard-earned cash on the games, consoles, and collectible figurines isn't payment enough.
1637080	1642080	They coerce themselves to give more and more to a company who is only intent on taking.
1642080	1649080	The cycle of exploitation will perpetuate itself until the fans wake up and recognize that they don't owe Nintendo anything,
1649080	1654080	and that a corporation 6,000 miles across the ocean doesn't actually care about them.
1654080	1660080	If you're looking towards Nintendo for salvation, you'd be better off placing that faith anywhere else.
1660080	1666080	Before Nintendo will change the way they treat their fans, the fans must change the way they treat Nintendo.
1666080	1673080	Forty years ago, Nintendo saved the video game industry. Now, it's up to Nintendo's fans to save themselves.
1673080	1679080	I'm not asking for people to hate Nintendo. I'm not asking for people to hate the fans.
1679080	1685080	All I'm asking is for everyone to step out of Neverland, and to treat Nintendo as just another company.
1685080	1687080	Which it is.
1696080	1717080	Come on now, the Wii? People trying to say that the PS3 is copying the Wii with the motion sensor.
1717080	1724080	I don't give a fuck. Shit, the Wii, you know what they should copy? They should copy how to get good games.
1724080	1727080	Oh, what are you doing to me? Oh, Nintendo!
