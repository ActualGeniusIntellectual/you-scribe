00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,200
About it, G.

2
00:00:01,200 --> 00:00:16,000
Hello, Internet, and welcome to Meme Theory, where Behind the Meme has become an epidemic.

3
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,200
Okay, I'm just gonna cut right to the chase here.

4
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:23,200
Dear Behind the Meme, enough is enough!

5
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:30,000
I have had it with these motherfucking Normies talking about my motherfucking memes!

6
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,960
Hey everybody, welcome back to another episode of Content Cuck.

7
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:39,040
Empdubs here, and this is the definitive Behind the Meme rant video.

8
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:40,400
Who is Behind the Meme?

9
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:44,400
Well, he's a YouTube channel that's become fairly popular over the last few months.

10
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:46,960
A lot of people like him, but a lot of people don't.

11
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:49,360
And I'm part of the ones who don't.

12
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:54,160
And I don't really think he or his Normie fans understand why.

13
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:57,680
I don't understand why I'm still getting hates.

14
00:00:57,680 --> 00:01:02,640
So allow me, a guy who actually knows a thing or two about meme culture,

15
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:05,360
to explain to you guys exactly how Behind the Meme

16
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:08,400
is fucking up the entirety of the memescape as we know it.

17
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:14,160
First, I'm going to give you guys a little bit of background information.

18
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:17,360
So in this video, you're going to hear me use the term Normie a lot.

19
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:21,280
So allow me to explain my definition of this term through this little analogy.

20
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:25,680
Basically, in the age of modern mass media, I'm talking about 1980s onwards,

21
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:30,960
you can divide media consumers into two main groups, the Normies and the outsiders.

22
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:36,960
The Normies are and have always been the majority, the mainstream, the hump of the bell curve.

23
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:41,520
If you're a TV or film or music producer, the Normies are generally where the money is.

24
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:45,600
Therefore, the vast majority of content seen in mass media is dictated by

25
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:52,320
and targeted towards Normies, or at least that's how it was before the age of the internet.

26
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:57,280
You see, 65 million years ago, the dinosaurs reigned supreme.

27
00:01:57,280 --> 00:02:00,480
Then a big ol' asteroid hit the planet and killed the dinosaurs.

28
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:06,640
And left to inhabit the scorched earth were these small, crafty, quirky animals called mammals,

29
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:10,560
but left to develop on their own with a few million years of evolution.

30
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:13,760
And I'd say us mammals are doing pretty good for ourselves.

31
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:16,000
A lot better than those dinosaurs everywhere.

32
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:27,360
You see, the Normies are the dinosaurs of consumer society,

33
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:32,720
the outsiders are the mammals, and the birth of the World Wide Web was the asteroid.

34
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:48,480
The outsiders include anyone who rejects mainstream media in favor of content

35
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:51,920
which matches their more niche and unconventional tastes.

36
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:55,680
In the 80s, the outsiders were mocked and outcast by the Normies,

37
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:59,680
only able to seek safety in the odd comic book store or sci-fi convention.

38
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:04,800
But then, in the 90s, this thing called the internet happened.

39
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:11,120
Imagine a world where every word ever written,

40
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:14,320
every picture ever painted, and every film ever shot

41
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:19,040
could be viewed instantly in your home via an information superhighway.

42
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:21,360
So, the Normies see this and they're like,

43
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:25,520
hey, this isn't MTV Jurassic Park or Pokemon, get that shit out of my face.

44
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:29,200
But for the outsiders, the internet was paradise.

45
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:33,360
Here you had an open, unregulated global platform on which you could post

46
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:35,840
and search for whatever odd stuff you wanted,

47
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:38,800
and there were no Normies around to ostracize you for it.

48
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:42,400
And not only that, but now you can connect with people from around the world,

49
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:46,880
people you didn't even know existed, who had the same weird and bizarre tastes as you.

50
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:48,960
Because on the internet, anything goes.

51
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:52,400
It's like the Wild West, or in this case, the Wild Web.

52
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:56,800
So, for a little bit, Normies and outsiders could both enjoy their own media in peace.

53
00:03:56,800 --> 00:04:01,200
The outsiders had the Wild Web and the Normies had the mainstream metropolis.

54
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:05,760
And for a time, they existed, balanced, two sides of a coin in harmony.

55
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:08,720
Then everything changed when the Normies attacked.

56
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:23,440
It's ironic, actually, how it's typically the Normies that make fun of the outsiders

57
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:26,720
for liking the media that we do, calling us weird and nerdy,

58
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:30,560
when all along the outsiders have always had superior media.

59
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:34,080
There was a time when reading comic books was considered super nerdy,

60
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:38,320
and now comic book characters make up 90% of the blockbusters in cinemas.

61
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:42,560
There was a time when playing video games meant you were a virgin living in your parents' basement,

62
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:46,720
and now people are making millions of dollars in front of millions of fans

63
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:48,800
playing video games for a living.

64
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:52,400
You see, the critical factor that sets outsiders apart from Normies

65
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:55,040
is that outsiders think outside the box.

66
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:57,520
They're creative, contemplative, analytical.

67
00:04:57,520 --> 00:05:01,760
They aren't satisfied with anything less than original, ingenious content.

68
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:06,560
This forces us to constantly innovate the media we consume and create.

69
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:09,600
Outsiders like to go out and explore their media.

70
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:14,480
Normies tend to want everything spoon-fed to them in a comfortable and unchallenging way.

71
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:17,360
They love the same old patterns and formulas.

72
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:19,280
If something works, why change it?

73
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:22,480
Man, fall down.

74
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:24,160
Funny.

75
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:30,080
This causes Normie media to become incredibly inert and slow to change.

76
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:33,840
The cycle usually repeats itself until whatever media at hand becomes so

77
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:38,160
insufferably derivative and stale that even the Normies get sick of it.

78
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:43,920
And as time goes on, the mainstream metropolis becomes more crowded and congested with

79
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:46,560
tired trends and cringey cliches.

80
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:49,840
And the more this goes on, the more the Normies want to get out.

81
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:53,760
And that's when they notice the fertile open plains of the wild web.

82
00:05:57,200 --> 00:05:59,280
So much like video games and comic books,

83
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:02,560
internet memes were once an outsider-exclusive media.

84
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:06,000
They were a kind of way for people from all these sort of obscure and

85
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,640
unconventional communities to communicate with one another.

86
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:10,640
An outsider's language, if you will.

87
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:13,760
Originally, memes were just a way for members of online communities and

88
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:15,600
fandoms to identify each other.

89
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:18,240
They weren't really meant to be widely understood.

90
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:22,880
Many early internet memes were just taken directly out of context from their original media.

91
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:27,360
So in order to understand the meme, you had to understand the media from which it came.

92
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:28,960
There was a time when if you came across

93
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:36,160
You either didn't understand the context and went on with your day,

94
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:40,560
or you recognized that it was a World of Warcraft reference and you found it funny.

95
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:45,920
This role-playing game out in 2004 returns to the world of Azeroth,

96
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:48,480
where heroes like Leroy Jenkins do battle.

97
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:54,800
And that would be the World of Warcraft.

98
00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:06,640
You established an immediate connection to whoever posted it,

99
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:10,080
without having to exchange a single line of direct communication.

100
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:14,400
Then somewhere along the way, the idea of an internet meme became a lot more meta.

101
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:19,360
Memes stopped being attached to media, and rather they started becoming media in their own right.

102
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:22,000
People started sharing memes because they were memes,

103
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,960
rather than as a method for communicating within a fandom.

104
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:27,760
This was the beginning of meme culture on the internet.

105
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:31,280
So at this point, memes were still an outsider's media source.

106
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:33,440
But since they were now their own media source,

107
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:36,720
lots of people felt obligated to catalog and document them.

108
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:40,880
This purpose was fulfilled through sites like Know Your Meme and Urban Dictionary,

109
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:44,160
but we'll be focusing specifically on Know Your Meme for this video.

110
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:47,920
Now, I have some pretty mixed opinions about Know Your Meme.

111
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:52,560
On one hand, it's a decent resource for researching the origins and history behind certain memes.

112
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:56,480
However, the articles on there can widely vary in quality,

113
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:59,440
with many being outdated and missing critical information.

114
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:02,640
Pages can also be pretty slow to update for new meme development,

115
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:05,760
so use the site at your own risk to research memes.

116
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:10,320
In my view, Know Your Meme is a good source for basic information on meme origins,

117
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:14,560
but I wouldn't rely on it too much for perspective and overall understanding,

118
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:17,920
which, unfortunately, a lot of people do.

119
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:20,080
But I can't really blame them that much.

120
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:25,520
Know Your Meme is the only real site where all the information about memes is located in one location.

121
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:29,520
The site can be classified as a secondary source for meme information.

122
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:32,800
They don't make the memes, they only write about them.

123
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:34,880
Much like historical secondary sources,

124
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:39,600
Know Your Meme is easier to access at the cost of information quality.

125
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:43,840
It's not that much of a problem until you add an additional layer of separation

126
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:45,440
between the viewer and the meme.

127
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:47,600
That's where Behind the Meme comes in.

128
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:52,000
Now that we've covered all the basics of your training,

129
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,640
it's time for the moment you've been waiting for!

130
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:09,280
So the premise of this YouTube channel is to host an educational series about memes.

131
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:12,000
Okay, not a completely original idea, but okay.

132
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,920
2016 was a big year for memes,

133
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:17,840
and there was definitely a market for a series discussing and analyzing memes,

134
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:20,480
which is why Anthony Fantano started the Meme Review.

135
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:22,480
Oh wait, we're talking about Behind the Meme.

136
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:27,440
Well, I'm sure there's room for a second meme discussion series on YouTube,

137
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:31,760
but instead of being knowledgeable, or interesting, or well edited,

138
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:34,240
or respectful of meme culture like Anthony Fantano,

139
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:37,360
Behind the Meme decided to take the route of presenting his content

140
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:40,320
in the most generic and bland way possible.

141
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:41,760
Eye-catching thumbnails,

142
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:44,160
look at me, look at me, look at me, look at me,

143
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:45,600
stock photos and music,

144
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:53,440
simple and slow editing,

145
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:56,160
the patronizing YouTuber voice,

146
00:09:56,160 --> 00:10:00,560
and every video feels like an identical template with an interchangeable topic.

147
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:02,800
He decides to employ all of these techniques

148
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:06,560
because Behind the Meme is interested in targeting normies,

149
00:10:07,280 --> 00:10:09,360
Fucking normies!

150
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:13,680
And since normies like unchallenging, basic, and repetitive content,

151
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:15,360
that's what Behind the Meme supplies.

152
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:19,440
Because what I see while looking at Behind the Meme's content in a vacuum

153
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:22,560
is not a good YouTuber, not a bad YouTuber,

154
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:25,280
but a mediocre YouTuber.

155
00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:29,040
Like the kind of kid who sits in class and does just enough to get a C-.

156
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:32,560
He knows that if he applied himself he could probably get a solid B,

157
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:33,760
or maybe even an A-.

158
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:37,440
But no, he would just rather not spend the extra effort or passion.

159
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:40,480
Because hey, a C- has a passing grade after all.

160
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:43,200
C is average, the middle of the bell curve,

161
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:47,120
which not so coincidentally is where his fan base lies.

162
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:55,040
So let's actually look at one of his videos and see just how mediocre Behind the Meme is

163
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:58,000
at actually doing his channel's self-professed purpose

164
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,400
and educating people about memes.

165
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:02,640
We're gonna watch the one about YouTube poops.

166
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:03,120
Why?

167
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:06,480
Because boy, I've been making fucking YouTube poops for seven years.

168
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:08,720
I know my fucking shit, okay?

169
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:11,280
Let's see how much Behind the Meme knows.

170
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:14,160
Now, I'll admit, when I first saw this video in my feed,

171
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:15,520
I actually got pretty excited.

172
00:11:15,520 --> 00:11:17,120
This guy's got a pretty big fan base,

173
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:20,400
so it'll be great to expose them to YouTube poops.

174
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:24,640
But then I actually watched the video and my enthusiasm went on a downward spiral.

175
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:28,080
Hello internet, and welcome to Behind the Meme.

176
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:31,120
So the video starts off with 30 seconds of intro processions

177
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:33,840
that are copy and pasted between every video.

178
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:35,920
Here we go.

179
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:40,080
YouTube poop, YouTube poop, YouTube poop.

180
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:43,120
Then another minute of beating around the bush with corny jokes

181
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:45,200
without actually explaining anything.

182
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:47,760
And then finally, one minute and 30 seconds in,

183
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:50,480
we get Behind the Meme's definition of YouTube poop.

184
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:53,040
So let's have a look at a couple definitions.

185
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:57,280
Which he literally reads verbatim off of Know Your Meme and Wikipedia.

186
00:11:57,280 --> 00:12:00,800
Come on, dude, at least be discreet about your complete lack of knowledge

187
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:03,120
or effort for researching this topic.

188
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:04,480
So for the next minute or so,

189
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:07,360
he just summarizes the Know Your Meme page on YouTube poops,

190
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:09,760
which, by the way, is extremely outdated.

191
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:10,960
And during this whole time,

192
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:14,240
he's just showing basic reaction GIFs and stock images

193
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:17,520
when he could be showing, I don't know, actual YouTube poops.

194
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:19,360
He literally said like a minute earlier

195
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:21,920
that YouTube poops were super duper hard to explain.

196
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:25,840
Trying to say is defining YouTube poop is kind of possible,

197
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:27,920
but at the same time impossible.

198
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:30,720
So why not show some instead of just explaining them?

199
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:32,720
But wait, showing YouTube poops

200
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:35,840
would put you at a tiny risk of getting copyright claimed.

201
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:36,880
Can't have that happen.

202
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:38,960
So I guess you might as well give your fans

203
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:41,520
as little visual information as possible

204
00:12:41,520 --> 00:12:43,760
about this incredibly complex topic

205
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:46,640
which you're describing on your educational YouTube channel.

206
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:48,880
So then he gets the part where he goes over poopisms.

207
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:52,480
Some of the defining poopisms that the videos use are ear rape,

208
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:56,160
which is the process of making the audio loud to the point of distortion.

209
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:58,320
Wow, what an ear rape you pulled off.

210
00:12:58,400 --> 00:13:00,880
Crank that shit up, you fucking pussy!

211
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:05,600
Oh wait, you don't want to hurt the ears of your oh-so-fragile normie fan base.

212
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:08,480
If you used actual ear rape, people might unsubscribe.

213
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:10,000
Oh, by the way, that reminds me.

214
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,840
Can you unsubscribe?

215
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:14,560
So then he mentions reversing and stutter loops,

216
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:17,200
techniques which have literally been around since World War II.

217
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:26,640
Seriously, everyone knows this shit already.

218
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:30,080
How about mentioning some more nuanced techniques like sentence mixing?

219
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:32,320
And also sentence shifting.

220
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:34,160
Sentence shifting.

221
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:36,240
You have got to be fucking kidding me.

222
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:47,360
So he continues reading off of Know Your Meme until finally he shows a YouTube poop.

223
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:48,080
Whoa!

224
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:50,000
And it's hot on our tail.

225
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:53,600
Now don't get me wrong, I don't have anything against this YouTube poop.

226
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:56,080
It's a really important part of YouTube poop history,

227
00:13:56,080 --> 00:13:59,120
but imagine the people in Behind the Meme's audience

228
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:02,640
who have never seen a YouTube poop before in their entire lives.

229
00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:05,120
And this is the first YouTube poop they see

230
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:09,040
from which they have to conceptualize what all other poops are like.

231
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:13,120
It's the equivalent of taking someone who has no idea what an automobile is

232
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:15,360
and in order to demonstrate an example of one,

233
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:19,760
you show them the 1886 Mercedes-Benz patent motor wagon.

234
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:27,040
The fuck is this?

235
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:29,040
Sure, it's technically an automobile,

236
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:31,600
and it's really important to the history of automobiles.

237
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:34,160
But to a person who knows nothing about automobiles,

238
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:35,920
it looks awkward and stupid,

239
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:39,040
and makes them question why anyone likes automobiles at all.

240
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:42,240
That's the type of impression Behind the Meme is giving by literally

241
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:45,440
only showing one poop as an example and nothing else.

242
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:48,800
And then he talks for a bit about YTPMVs and says they're

243
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:53,680
the same concept as the regular poop edits but only with the addition of music.

244
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:57,120
Which is a gross, gross overgeneralization.

245
00:14:57,120 --> 00:15:00,800
Then he says YTPs are important because they're the grandfather of memes.

246
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:05,280
The YouTube poop videos are kind of like the grandfather of today's memes.

247
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:08,720
Which is also inaccurate in pretty much every aspect

248
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:12,800
and demonstrates a complete lack of knowledge about the true depth of internet meme history.

249
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:14,960
And that's the end of the video.

250
00:15:14,960 --> 00:15:16,640
Six and a half minutes.

251
00:15:16,640 --> 00:15:19,600
Four minutes of which were actually spent discussing YouTube poop.

252
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:22,880
And through all of it, he didn't actually explain anything.

253
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:27,360
If anything, he actually made people more ignorant to what YTP actually is.

254
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:32,000
All he did was read some definitions and define some terms off of an outdated web page.

255
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,240
There's pretty much no analysis whatsoever.

256
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:37,280
He mentions nothing about different styles and methodologies.

257
00:15:37,280 --> 00:15:39,040
How YouTube poops are entertaining.

258
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:41,840
The incredible evolution of the medium over the past decade.

259
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:44,000
You get nothing!

260
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:44,800
You lose!

261
00:15:45,520 --> 00:15:46,560
Good day, sir!

262
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:58,480
What is wrong with this picture?

263
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:09,440
Oh, you stupid son of a-

264
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:15,360
And so the Democrats are trapped right now

265
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:18,320
in a downward spiral of just being negative and hostile.

266
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:19,280
Downward spiral.

267
00:16:19,280 --> 00:16:20,240
Downward spiral.

268
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:20,880
Downward spiral.

269
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:24,080
The Democrats are in a downward spiral.

270
00:16:31,520 --> 00:16:34,640
Funding for meme theory is provided by

271
00:16:34,640 --> 00:16:36,640
FUCKING NO ONE

272
00:16:36,640 --> 00:16:40,800
Well, I guess now's the time to open up a Patreon and horror the shit out of my fans.

273
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:48,480
We so bad! We so bad! We so bad! We so bad!

274
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:49,520
Get off the stage!

275
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:11,040
So let's talk about Anthony Fantano for a little bit.

276
00:17:11,840 --> 00:17:18,960
I mentioned him before in this video.

277
00:17:18,960 --> 00:17:23,360
He's the creator of THE MEAN REVIEW on his channel That Is The Plan

278
00:17:23,360 --> 00:17:26,640
along with his more popular music review channel The Needle Drop.

279
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:29,840
Now, I consider Anthony Fantano to be a really underrated

280
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:32,800
and underappreciated YouTuber in the grand scheme of things.

281
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:36,880
What I see when I look at his content is a really intelligent and level-headed guy

282
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:41,680
who churns out consistently good content and has been doing so for several years.

283
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:47,200
He strikes me as a very unique YouTube reviewer in both his editing style and commentary.

284
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:52,320
Most media reviewers on YouTube get popular by being scathingly negative and bitter towards

285
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:56,640
what they're reviewing because YouTube audiences generally love to hate on stuff.

286
00:17:56,640 --> 00:18:00,480
As a matter of fact, I'm gonna predict that this video is gonna get a shitload of views

287
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:02,640
because I'm being critical of another YouTuber.

288
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:08,320
But Anthony Fantano has taken the approach of being much more mellow and reasonable in his views.

289
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:12,160
Honestly, it's refreshing to see this calmer attitude amidst the oversaturated

290
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:14,880
I'M PISSED OFF gimmick of YouTube reviewers.

291
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:17,760
He also gives the impression of being genuine and down-to-earth.

292
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:22,160
You can tell he actually cares about his content and believes what he's saying in his videos.

293
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:24,880
It's important to note that last year when it was really

294
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:28,560
trendy to shit on Leafy after iDubbbz made the Leafy Content Cop,

295
00:18:28,560 --> 00:18:32,000
Anthony Fantano made a video criticizing both iDubbbz and Leafy

296
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,560
rather than cashing in on the Leafy hate train.

297
00:18:34,560 --> 00:18:39,840
This incident really cemented in my mind that Anthony Fantano values speaking honestly

298
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:43,360
more than YouTube success, which is a really admirable trait.

299
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:50,240
But to be honest, the best aspect of Anthony Fantano's reviews is that he knows his shit.

300
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:54,400
Whether it's a music or meme review, you get a strong impression

301
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:57,360
that Anthony Fantano knows what the fuck he's talking about.

302
00:18:57,360 --> 00:19:02,080
And that's the primary reason why me and a lot of other people respect him so much.

303
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:06,960
So when he notices this guy called Behind The Meme, who doesn't actually know jack shit about

304
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:12,400
memes, make a series very similar to his, and people are actually listening to him and watching

305
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:17,760
his content, he gets upset. So Anthony Fantano decides to release the equivalent of a diss track.

306
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:25,760
I like memes, you guys. Please accept me.

307
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:30,000
This is the part of the video where I regurgitate information I found on Know Your Meme,

308
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,480
but you're so stupid, you think I researched it.

309
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:35,680
And please make sure you subscribe so you can watch my next video,

310
00:19:35,680 --> 00:19:39,600
because lord knows nobody is watching my videos on my other YouTube channel.

311
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:44,160
This is really my last-ditch effort at YouTube relevance, guys, so please.

312
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:46,640
God, please.

313
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:49,520
And I'll admit, he fucking hammers behind the meme here.

314
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:51,760
It's more savage than fucking Randy.

315
00:19:51,760 --> 00:20:04,400
How are you gonna like it when you get some of your own medicine from Mama Memes?

316
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:12,400
Oh, dude, I understand the orange cap.

317
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:18,080
The fuck?

318
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:21,040
You know what? I went to school with a lot of people like that.

319
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:24,800
Even, you know, even where I went to school, they had geeks.

320
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:26,000
That looks like a geek.

321
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:32,560
You want to explain to me what you're doing here?

322
00:20:32,560 --> 00:20:36,720
All kidding aside, you're a good guy. You have some funny stuff.

323
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:40,880
Stop, stop, pretty cute people. Do what you're good at.

324
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:44,000
Stop, pretty cute people. Do what you're good at.

325
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:56,640
Stop, pretty cute people.

326
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:24,800
The only thing you're good at is being a little bitch.

327
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:30,640
Stop being a little bitch.

328
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:38,160
You see, Anthony Fantano had put behind the meme in a lose-lose situation,

329
00:21:38,160 --> 00:21:42,560
but by far the most favorable route that behind the meme could have taken was to

330
00:21:42,560 --> 00:21:48,160
ignore the parody video and disassociate himself from Anthony Fantano as much as possible.

331
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:52,080
But, as you might have guessed, behind the meme chose the worst possible outcome

332
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:55,040
by directly responding through a video upload.

333
00:21:55,040 --> 00:21:59,200
Now, this was a stupidly bad mistake by behind the meme, and here's why.

334
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:03,520
First of all, he immediately made an enemy out of Anthony Fantano's fans,

335
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:06,720
and the fans of the meme review are generally outsiders,

336
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:11,840
the people you need to like you if you want to be respected as a meme channel on YouTube.

337
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:17,280
By choosing to respond to Anthony Fantano, behind the meme automatically and permanently

338
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:21,360
established himself as a pro-normie and anti-outsider channel.

339
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:25,040
Additionally, in doing this, behind the meme branded himself as a competitor

340
00:22:25,040 --> 00:22:27,840
and rival to Anthony Fantano rather than an ally,

341
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:30,960
and he basically entered a battle which he cannot win.

342
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:36,640
Behind the meme is less clever, less original, and knows less about memes than Anthony Fantano,

343
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:39,920
so he can't possibly expect to come out of this on top.

344
00:22:39,920 --> 00:22:42,880
And when I say come out on top, I'm not talking about subscribers.

345
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:45,040
I'm talking about being respected.

346
00:22:45,040 --> 00:22:49,520
Leafy has a lot of subscribers, and he's generally maligned by pretty much everyone.

347
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:54,080
I've said this lots of times before, but sub count really doesn't matter on YouTube,

348
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:59,360
and by disputing Anthony Fantano, behind the meme set himself up to be hated.

349
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:03,760
That's a stupid decision that can only be made by a stupid idiot.

350
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:04,720
You dumbass!

351
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:06,160
But wait, there's more!

352
00:23:06,160 --> 00:23:06,880
Uh-oh.

353
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:09,120
Looks like the message didn't quite get through.

354
00:23:09,920 --> 00:23:17,520
So, out of everything we've covered already,

355
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:20,320
this is the thing that really pissed me off the most.

356
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:22,720
So this time, instead of responding to a YouTuber,

357
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:26,640
behind the meme literally responds to a 4chan post.

358
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:29,840
Like, how petty can you possibly fucking be?

359
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:34,320
Do you honestly have to respond to every ounce of criticism you receive on the internet?

360
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:35,760
Are you that fucking insecure?

361
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:39,440
Zinzi is an attempt to get me to make a video on a meme that makes no sense

362
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:43,120
and really doesn't exist, so I look like a fool and lose credibility.

363
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:46,640
Hey, behind the meme,

364
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:49,360
here's a little bit of information that you may have missed

365
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:51,920
because you weren't able to read it off of Know Your Meme.

366
00:23:51,920 --> 00:23:58,400
The people of 4chan hate and make fun of everybody, especially normies like you.

367
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:03,840
Did you seriously expect them to welcome your bastardization of memes with open arms?

368
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:05,440
Are you really that dense?

369
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:08,240
Yes, there are people who will dislike you on the internet.

370
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:10,240
It's an inevitability.

371
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:15,920
Being upset at 4chan for being mean to you is like being mad at a bear for shitting in the woods.

372
00:24:15,920 --> 00:24:18,800
And the worst part is that everyone in the comments are supporting him.

373
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:21,440
Way to go behind the meme, you really showed them.

374
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:24,640
Way to criticize a site that literally makes fun of itself.

375
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:30,080
Is everybody just completely oblivious to how fundamentally flawed the message of this video is?

376
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:33,920
He complains about 4chan being elitist when it comes to memes.

377
00:24:33,920 --> 00:24:37,840
You see, some people on the internet like to act like elitist when it comes to memes.

378
00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:38,960
Well, of course they are.

379
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:42,800
4chan ain't good for much, but they churn out some fucking good memes.

380
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:07,440
The people of 4chan live and breathe memetics.

381
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:09,840
Look at the way they speak, the pictures they post.

382
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:14,800
No other site on the internet is as adept at utilizing memetics as 4chan.

383
00:25:14,800 --> 00:25:17,200
So of course they're fucking elitist about memes,

384
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:20,320
just like how Michael Jordan is elitist about basketball.

385
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:23,280
When you're that good at something, you deserve to be arrogant.

386
00:25:23,280 --> 00:25:26,480
And then you're upset that they're complaining about you,

387
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:28,320
someone who knows nothing about memes,

388
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:33,200
exposing the memes that they created to an audience of normies whom they despise.

389
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:35,520
And here we arrive at the main point of this video.

390
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:45,680
The existence and continuation of Behind the Memes channel

391
00:25:45,680 --> 00:25:48,720
is dismantling and destroying the culture of memes,

392
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:52,320
which has been delicately constructed over the course of two decades.

393
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:55,200
He's acting like such a hero, such a saint.

394
00:25:55,200 --> 00:26:00,480
Oh, I'm educating those poor unfortunate normies who can't learn about memes for themselves,

395
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:03,120
all so that they don't have to feel left out.

396
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:06,880
Subscribe to Behind the Meme and never feel left out again.

397
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:08,400
I'm the good guy here.

398
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:10,640
Okay there chief, hold the fuck up for a second.

399
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:14,640
You're not devoting your time and effort to teach impoverished schoolchildren in Africa.

400
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:16,640
You're talking about memes on the internet.

401
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:19,040
You're not exactly humanitarian of the year here.

402
00:26:19,040 --> 00:26:24,080
These poor unfortunate people you claim to be helping have access to the internet too,

403
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:25,200
you do realize that.

404
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:27,440
They can become an expert in any meme they want,

405
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:31,120
but the truth is they're all lazy and they prefer to be spoon fed

406
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:35,680
with unchallenging and generic content like the normies they are.

407
00:26:35,680 --> 00:26:39,600
And others shouldn't feel dumb when they see a new meme and don't exactly get the joke.

408
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:40,080
Wrong.

409
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:43,120
You see, back in the day, only the most ambitious meme seekers

410
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:48,320
could actually take the patience and time to learn about memes and meme culture on their own.

411
00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:51,600
This system allowed the meme economy to be sustainable

412
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:53,760
because the only people who had access to memes

413
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:57,600
were those who were willing to actually go out and investigate them on their own.

414
00:26:57,600 --> 00:27:00,960
Memes were consumed more slowly and they lasted longer.

415
00:27:01,040 --> 00:27:02,480
Now, thanks to behind the meme,

416
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:06,720
everyone can have a superficial understanding of memes and overuse them as much as they want.

417
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:07,680
Isn't that great?

418
00:27:07,680 --> 00:27:08,800
Wait, it's not.

419
00:27:08,800 --> 00:27:10,560
Because when everyone knows about a meme,

420
00:27:10,560 --> 00:27:15,040
it becomes so deluded that no one wants to use the meme anymore and it dies.

421
00:27:15,040 --> 00:27:18,720
You're basically inviting all these normie children to piss in our meme pool.

422
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:21,280
You force everyone else to jump to cleaner water

423
00:27:21,280 --> 00:27:24,640
while you make your area so insufferably full of piss

424
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:27,920
that eventually no one, not even normies, want to swim in them.

425
00:27:27,920 --> 00:27:30,160
And this just keeps happening faster and faster.

426
00:27:30,160 --> 00:27:33,040
The meme economy isn't sustainable anymore.

427
00:27:33,040 --> 00:27:35,440
And soon, we're gonna run out of clean water.

428
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:38,960
You have any idea how much faster memes die nowadays?

429
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:42,800
For someone who claims to love memes so much, you really don't seem to care.

430
00:27:42,800 --> 00:27:46,480
As a matter of fact, you don't even seem to be aware of what you're doing.

431
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:49,600
I like how you tell 4chan to look at the bigger picture.

432
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:52,560
But if they would take a step back and look at the big picture of things,

433
00:27:52,560 --> 00:27:54,480
they would see that I'm just a teacher.

434
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:57,120
As if you understand memes better than they do.

435
00:27:57,120 --> 00:28:00,640
But guys, I'm totally part of your community and I have been for years.

436
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:04,160
The thing is, all those who hate on my channel should be happy it's me.

437
00:28:04,160 --> 00:28:07,200
I've been a part of your communities and forums for years.

438
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:08,320
I am one of you.

439
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:11,600
And this is the worst part of it all behind the meme

440
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:14,720
because you claim to be just like us, the outsiders.

441
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:16,160
But you're not like us.

442
00:28:16,160 --> 00:28:18,960
You are a normie.

443
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:21,360
Just like your fan base.

444
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:24,080
So stop lying to us and lying to yourself.

445
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:26,000
Anthony Fantano is an outsider.

446
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,560
The people of 4chan are outsiders.

447
00:28:28,560 --> 00:28:31,200
You, behind the meme, are a normie.

448
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:34,720
And it doesn't matter how much you pretend to be such a meme expert.

449
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:40,480
You make it apparent that you're a normie through your bland, unchallenging, and generic videos.

450
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:44,560
You try to be like Anthony Fantano, but end up being like WatchMojo.

451
00:28:44,560 --> 00:28:46,960
Because you lack the creativity and wit

452
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:52,720
to differentiate yourself from the most ordinary dime-a-dozen YouTube content clones.

453
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:54,800
You are not distinct.

454
00:28:54,880 --> 00:29:00,000
Anyone could replace you and half of your fans wouldn't even notice or care.

455
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:03,520
And if that wasn't enough, you want everyone to be just like you.

456
00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:09,040
And you simply cannot fathom a world where people disagree with your flawed concept of memes.

457
00:29:09,040 --> 00:29:12,800
So you seek to belittle, condescend, and patronize them.

458
00:29:12,800 --> 00:29:15,920
And even worse is that you use this fake persona

459
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:20,400
to give yourself a scrap of legitimacy towards educating people about memes

460
00:29:20,400 --> 00:29:22,720
when you don't know anything about them.

461
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:26,000
And you end up feeding them superficial and inaccurate information

462
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:29,440
leading to even more people like you who think they know memes,

463
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:32,240
but actually don't know jack shit.

464
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:34,880
But hey, that's the internet for ya.

465
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:39,440
And on the internet, ignorance is king.

466
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:54,720
So I just want to take these last few minutes to tie up some loose ends.

467
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:57,920
First of all, I want to say that I do not hate behind the meme.

468
00:29:57,920 --> 00:30:01,600
I just hate this idea that what he's doing is perfectly okay

469
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:06,240
and that we have some sort of obligation to make sure that no Normie gets left behind.

470
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:10,400
No, he has to understand that there are negative consequences to what he's doing.

471
00:30:10,400 --> 00:30:14,160
However, I do not view him as someone with malicious intent.

472
00:30:14,160 --> 00:30:18,000
Rather, I view him as someone who misunderstands his role in the meme-scape.

473
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:21,840
I'm not opposed either to the idea of Normies learning about memes.

474
00:30:21,840 --> 00:30:23,680
I just think you have to be careful about it

475
00:30:23,680 --> 00:30:27,120
and actually do a good job of explaining the memes and their context.

476
00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:31,200
I think it's better to try to bring Normies up to our level rather than sinking to theirs.

477
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:33,040
The Meme Review does a good job of this,

478
00:30:33,040 --> 00:30:36,400
and I would highly recommend people watch that instead of Behind the Meme.

479
00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:41,520
But the fact of the matter is that Behind the Meme has a wider appeal than the Meme Review ever could

480
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:43,680
simply because of the nature of Normies.

481
00:30:43,680 --> 00:30:47,520
All I know is that you never see the Meme Review on the YouTube Trending tab.

482
00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:52,720
It's frustrating how YouTube is systematically favoring an inferior meme series.

483
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:56,720
But it's what Normies want to see, and it's what gets views.

484
00:30:56,720 --> 00:31:00,720
And that's the bottom line on YouTube, so there's nothing we can really do about it.

485
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:04,400
I understand that he's a Normie trying to dictate an outsider culture,

486
00:31:04,400 --> 00:31:09,680
but I also understand that the meme-scape is constantly evolving and it's impossible to fight it.

487
00:31:09,680 --> 00:31:13,600
Perhaps what is happening now is just part of the natural progression of memes,

488
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:16,160
but we can't really tell for sure either way.

489
00:31:16,160 --> 00:31:20,160
Finally, I understand that this video is going to get me hated by a lot of people,

490
00:31:20,160 --> 00:31:22,080
and that's a consequence I'm willing to accept.

491
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:26,320
My goal with this video is not to start YouTube drama nor expose a YouTuber.

492
00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:29,440
My goal with this video is to explain a perspective.

493
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:33,440
A perspective which is unclear and overlooked by many people.

494
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:36,800
I feel like there are a lot of misconceptions about memes out there,

495
00:31:36,800 --> 00:31:40,720
and I want to continue this series to make as much sense of it as I can.

496
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:43,520
Because if there's one thing I learned while making this video,

497
00:31:43,520 --> 00:31:47,120
it's that people in general really don't know much about memes.

498
00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:51,760
The meme-scape today is incredibly deep and complex, and it changes every day.

499
00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:54,640
There are so many components that have yet to be explored,

500
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:58,400
and I think all of us could try to understand it better, including me.

501
00:31:58,400 --> 00:32:01,520
But hey, that's why it's just a theory!

502
00:32:01,520 --> 00:32:03,280
A meme theory!

503
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:06,000
Thanks for unsubscribing!
