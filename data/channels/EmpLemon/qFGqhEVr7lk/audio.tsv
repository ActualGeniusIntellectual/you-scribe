0	1200	About it, G.
1200	16000	Hello, Internet, and welcome to Meme Theory, where Behind the Meme has become an epidemic.
16000	19200	Okay, I'm just gonna cut right to the chase here.
19200	23200	Dear Behind the Meme, enough is enough!
23200	30000	I have had it with these motherfucking Normies talking about my motherfucking memes!
30000	32960	Hey everybody, welcome back to another episode of Content Cuck.
33680	39040	Empdubs here, and this is the definitive Behind the Meme rant video.
39040	40400	Who is Behind the Meme?
40400	44400	Well, he's a YouTube channel that's become fairly popular over the last few months.
44400	46960	A lot of people like him, but a lot of people don't.
46960	49360	And I'm part of the ones who don't.
49360	54160	And I don't really think he or his Normie fans understand why.
54160	57680	I don't understand why I'm still getting hates.
57680	62640	So allow me, a guy who actually knows a thing or two about meme culture,
62640	65360	to explain to you guys exactly how Behind the Meme
65360	68400	is fucking up the entirety of the memescape as we know it.
71280	74160	First, I'm going to give you guys a little bit of background information.
74160	77360	So in this video, you're going to hear me use the term Normie a lot.
77360	81280	So allow me to explain my definition of this term through this little analogy.
81280	85680	Basically, in the age of modern mass media, I'm talking about 1980s onwards,
85680	90960	you can divide media consumers into two main groups, the Normies and the outsiders.
90960	96960	The Normies are and have always been the majority, the mainstream, the hump of the bell curve.
96960	101520	If you're a TV or film or music producer, the Normies are generally where the money is.
101520	105600	Therefore, the vast majority of content seen in mass media is dictated by
105680	112320	and targeted towards Normies, or at least that's how it was before the age of the internet.
113200	117280	You see, 65 million years ago, the dinosaurs reigned supreme.
117280	120480	Then a big ol' asteroid hit the planet and killed the dinosaurs.
120480	126640	And left to inhabit the scorched earth were these small, crafty, quirky animals called mammals,
126640	130560	but left to develop on their own with a few million years of evolution.
130560	133760	And I'd say us mammals are doing pretty good for ourselves.
133760	136000	A lot better than those dinosaurs everywhere.
143120	147360	You see, the Normies are the dinosaurs of consumer society,
147360	152720	the outsiders are the mammals, and the birth of the World Wide Web was the asteroid.
164480	168480	The outsiders include anyone who rejects mainstream media in favor of content
168480	171920	which matches their more niche and unconventional tastes.
171920	175680	In the 80s, the outsiders were mocked and outcast by the Normies,
175680	179680	only able to seek safety in the odd comic book store or sci-fi convention.
181760	184800	But then, in the 90s, this thing called the internet happened.
188160	191120	Imagine a world where every word ever written,
191120	194320	every picture ever painted, and every film ever shot
194320	199040	could be viewed instantly in your home via an information superhighway.
199040	201360	So, the Normies see this and they're like,
201360	205520	hey, this isn't MTV Jurassic Park or Pokemon, get that shit out of my face.
205520	209200	But for the outsiders, the internet was paradise.
209200	213360	Here you had an open, unregulated global platform on which you could post
213360	215840	and search for whatever odd stuff you wanted,
215840	218800	and there were no Normies around to ostracize you for it.
218800	222400	And not only that, but now you can connect with people from around the world,
222400	226880	people you didn't even know existed, who had the same weird and bizarre tastes as you.
226880	228960	Because on the internet, anything goes.
228960	232400	It's like the Wild West, or in this case, the Wild Web.
232400	236800	So, for a little bit, Normies and outsiders could both enjoy their own media in peace.
236800	241200	The outsiders had the Wild Web and the Normies had the mainstream metropolis.
241200	245760	And for a time, they existed, balanced, two sides of a coin in harmony.
245760	248720	Then everything changed when the Normies attacked.
248720	263440	It's ironic, actually, how it's typically the Normies that make fun of the outsiders
263440	266720	for liking the media that we do, calling us weird and nerdy,
266720	270560	when all along the outsiders have always had superior media.
270560	274080	There was a time when reading comic books was considered super nerdy,
274080	278320	and now comic book characters make up 90% of the blockbusters in cinemas.
278320	282560	There was a time when playing video games meant you were a virgin living in your parents' basement,
282560	286720	and now people are making millions of dollars in front of millions of fans
286720	288800	playing video games for a living.
288800	292400	You see, the critical factor that sets outsiders apart from Normies
292400	295040	is that outsiders think outside the box.
295040	297520	They're creative, contemplative, analytical.
297520	301760	They aren't satisfied with anything less than original, ingenious content.
301760	306560	This forces us to constantly innovate the media we consume and create.
306560	309600	Outsiders like to go out and explore their media.
309600	314480	Normies tend to want everything spoon-fed to them in a comfortable and unchallenging way.
314480	317360	They love the same old patterns and formulas.
317360	319280	If something works, why change it?
321040	322480	Man, fall down.
323600	324160	Funny.
326160	330080	This causes Normie media to become incredibly inert and slow to change.
330080	333840	The cycle usually repeats itself until whatever media at hand becomes so
333840	338160	insufferably derivative and stale that even the Normies get sick of it.
339360	343920	And as time goes on, the mainstream metropolis becomes more crowded and congested with
343920	346560	tired trends and cringey cliches.
346560	349840	And the more this goes on, the more the Normies want to get out.
349840	353760	And that's when they notice the fertile open plains of the wild web.
357200	359280	So much like video games and comic books,
359280	362560	internet memes were once an outsider-exclusive media.
362560	366000	They were a kind of way for people from all these sort of obscure and
366000	368640	unconventional communities to communicate with one another.
368640	370640	An outsider's language, if you will.
370640	373760	Originally, memes were just a way for members of online communities and
373760	375600	fandoms to identify each other.
375600	378240	They weren't really meant to be widely understood.
378240	382880	Many early internet memes were just taken directly out of context from their original media.
382880	387360	So in order to understand the meme, you had to understand the media from which it came.
387360	388960	There was a time when if you came across
393200	396160	You either didn't understand the context and went on with your day,
396160	400560	or you recognized that it was a World of Warcraft reference and you found it funny.
400560	405920	This role-playing game out in 2004 returns to the world of Azeroth,
405920	408480	where heroes like Leroy Jenkins do battle.
412640	414800	And that would be the World of Warcraft.
417360	426640	You established an immediate connection to whoever posted it,
426640	430080	without having to exchange a single line of direct communication.
430080	434400	Then somewhere along the way, the idea of an internet meme became a lot more meta.
434400	439360	Memes stopped being attached to media, and rather they started becoming media in their own right.
439360	442000	People started sharing memes because they were memes,
442000	444960	rather than as a method for communicating within a fandom.
444960	447760	This was the beginning of meme culture on the internet.
447760	451280	So at this point, memes were still an outsider's media source.
451280	453440	But since they were now their own media source,
453440	456720	lots of people felt obligated to catalog and document them.
456720	460880	This purpose was fulfilled through sites like Know Your Meme and Urban Dictionary,
460880	464160	but we'll be focusing specifically on Know Your Meme for this video.
464720	467920	Now, I have some pretty mixed opinions about Know Your Meme.
467920	472560	On one hand, it's a decent resource for researching the origins and history behind certain memes.
472560	476480	However, the articles on there can widely vary in quality,
476480	479440	with many being outdated and missing critical information.
479440	482640	Pages can also be pretty slow to update for new meme development,
482640	485760	so use the site at your own risk to research memes.
485760	490320	In my view, Know Your Meme is a good source for basic information on meme origins,
490320	494560	but I wouldn't rely on it too much for perspective and overall understanding,
494560	497920	which, unfortunately, a lot of people do.
497920	500080	But I can't really blame them that much.
500160	505520	Know Your Meme is the only real site where all the information about memes is located in one location.
505520	509520	The site can be classified as a secondary source for meme information.
509520	512800	They don't make the memes, they only write about them.
512800	514880	Much like historical secondary sources,
514880	519600	Know Your Meme is easier to access at the cost of information quality.
519600	523840	It's not that much of a problem until you add an additional layer of separation
523840	525440	between the viewer and the meme.
525440	527600	That's where Behind the Meme comes in.
527600	532000	Now that we've covered all the basics of your training,
532000	534640	it's time for the moment you've been waiting for!
544560	549280	So the premise of this YouTube channel is to host an educational series about memes.
549280	552000	Okay, not a completely original idea, but okay.
552000	553920	2016 was a big year for memes,
553920	557840	and there was definitely a market for a series discussing and analyzing memes,
557840	560480	which is why Anthony Fantano started the Meme Review.
560480	562480	Oh wait, we're talking about Behind the Meme.
563760	567440	Well, I'm sure there's room for a second meme discussion series on YouTube,
567440	571760	but instead of being knowledgeable, or interesting, or well edited,
571760	574240	or respectful of meme culture like Anthony Fantano,
574240	577360	Behind the Meme decided to take the route of presenting his content
577360	580320	in the most generic and bland way possible.
580320	581760	Eye-catching thumbnails,
582320	584160	look at me, look at me, look at me, look at me,
584160	585600	stock photos and music,
591760	593440	simple and slow editing,
593440	596160	the patronizing YouTuber voice,
596160	600560	and every video feels like an identical template with an interchangeable topic.
600560	602800	He decides to employ all of these techniques
602800	606560	because Behind the Meme is interested in targeting normies,
607280	609360	Fucking normies!
609360	613680	And since normies like unchallenging, basic, and repetitive content,
613680	615360	that's what Behind the Meme supplies.
616160	619440	Because what I see while looking at Behind the Meme's content in a vacuum
619440	622560	is not a good YouTuber, not a bad YouTuber,
622560	625280	but a mediocre YouTuber.
625280	629040	Like the kind of kid who sits in class and does just enough to get a C-.
629760	632560	He knows that if he applied himself he could probably get a solid B,
632560	633760	or maybe even an A-.
633840	637440	But no, he would just rather not spend the extra effort or passion.
637440	640480	Because hey, a C- has a passing grade after all.
640480	643200	C is average, the middle of the bell curve,
643200	647120	which not so coincidentally is where his fan base lies.
650160	655040	So let's actually look at one of his videos and see just how mediocre Behind the Meme is
655040	658000	at actually doing his channel's self-professed purpose
658000	660400	and educating people about memes.
660400	662640	We're gonna watch the one about YouTube poops.
662640	663120	Why?
663120	666480	Because boy, I've been making fucking YouTube poops for seven years.
666480	668720	I know my fucking shit, okay?
668720	671280	Let's see how much Behind the Meme knows.
671280	674160	Now, I'll admit, when I first saw this video in my feed,
674160	675520	I actually got pretty excited.
675520	677120	This guy's got a pretty big fan base,
677120	680400	so it'll be great to expose them to YouTube poops.
680400	684640	But then I actually watched the video and my enthusiasm went on a downward spiral.
684640	688080	Hello internet, and welcome to Behind the Meme.
688080	691120	So the video starts off with 30 seconds of intro processions
691120	693840	that are copy and pasted between every video.
693840	695920	Here we go.
695920	700080	YouTube poop, YouTube poop, YouTube poop.
700080	703120	Then another minute of beating around the bush with corny jokes
703120	705200	without actually explaining anything.
705200	707760	And then finally, one minute and 30 seconds in,
707760	710480	we get Behind the Meme's definition of YouTube poop.
710480	713040	So let's have a look at a couple definitions.
713040	717280	Which he literally reads verbatim off of Know Your Meme and Wikipedia.
717280	720800	Come on, dude, at least be discreet about your complete lack of knowledge
720800	723120	or effort for researching this topic.
723120	724480	So for the next minute or so,
724480	727360	he just summarizes the Know Your Meme page on YouTube poops,
727360	729760	which, by the way, is extremely outdated.
729760	730960	And during this whole time,
730960	734240	he's just showing basic reaction GIFs and stock images
734240	737520	when he could be showing, I don't know, actual YouTube poops.
737520	739360	He literally said like a minute earlier
739360	741920	that YouTube poops were super duper hard to explain.
741920	745840	Trying to say is defining YouTube poop is kind of possible,
745840	747920	but at the same time impossible.
747920	750720	So why not show some instead of just explaining them?
750720	752720	But wait, showing YouTube poops
752720	755840	would put you at a tiny risk of getting copyright claimed.
755840	756880	Can't have that happen.
756880	758960	So I guess you might as well give your fans
758960	761520	as little visual information as possible
761520	763760	about this incredibly complex topic
763760	766640	which you're describing on your educational YouTube channel.
766640	768880	So then he gets the part where he goes over poopisms.
768880	772480	Some of the defining poopisms that the videos use are ear rape,
772480	776160	which is the process of making the audio loud to the point of distortion.
776160	778320	Wow, what an ear rape you pulled off.
778400	780880	Crank that shit up, you fucking pussy!
780880	785600	Oh wait, you don't want to hurt the ears of your oh-so-fragile normie fan base.
785600	788480	If you used actual ear rape, people might unsubscribe.
788480	790000	Oh, by the way, that reminds me.
790000	791840	Can you unsubscribe?
791840	794560	So then he mentions reversing and stutter loops,
794560	797200	techniques which have literally been around since World War II.
804880	806640	Seriously, everyone knows this shit already.
806640	810080	How about mentioning some more nuanced techniques like sentence mixing?
810080	812320	And also sentence shifting.
812320	814160	Sentence shifting.
814160	816240	You have got to be fucking kidding me.
821440	827360	So he continues reading off of Know Your Meme until finally he shows a YouTube poop.
827360	828080	Whoa!
828080	830000	And it's hot on our tail.
830000	833600	Now don't get me wrong, I don't have anything against this YouTube poop.
833600	836080	It's a really important part of YouTube poop history,
836080	839120	but imagine the people in Behind the Meme's audience
839120	842640	who have never seen a YouTube poop before in their entire lives.
842640	845120	And this is the first YouTube poop they see
845120	849040	from which they have to conceptualize what all other poops are like.
849040	853120	It's the equivalent of taking someone who has no idea what an automobile is
853120	855360	and in order to demonstrate an example of one,
855360	859760	you show them the 1886 Mercedes-Benz patent motor wagon.
859760	867040	The fuck is this?
867040	869040	Sure, it's technically an automobile,
869040	871600	and it's really important to the history of automobiles.
871600	874160	But to a person who knows nothing about automobiles,
874160	875920	it looks awkward and stupid,
875920	879040	and makes them question why anyone likes automobiles at all.
879040	882240	That's the type of impression Behind the Meme is giving by literally
882240	885440	only showing one poop as an example and nothing else.
885440	888800	And then he talks for a bit about YTPMVs and says they're
888880	893680	the same concept as the regular poop edits but only with the addition of music.
893680	897120	Which is a gross, gross overgeneralization.
897120	900800	Then he says YTPs are important because they're the grandfather of memes.
900800	905280	The YouTube poop videos are kind of like the grandfather of today's memes.
905280	908720	Which is also inaccurate in pretty much every aspect
908720	912800	and demonstrates a complete lack of knowledge about the true depth of internet meme history.
912800	914960	And that's the end of the video.
914960	916640	Six and a half minutes.
916640	919600	Four minutes of which were actually spent discussing YouTube poop.
919600	922880	And through all of it, he didn't actually explain anything.
922880	927360	If anything, he actually made people more ignorant to what YTP actually is.
927360	932000	All he did was read some definitions and define some terms off of an outdated web page.
932000	934240	There's pretty much no analysis whatsoever.
934240	937280	He mentions nothing about different styles and methodologies.
937280	939040	How YouTube poops are entertaining.
939040	941840	The incredible evolution of the medium over the past decade.
941840	944000	You get nothing!
944000	944800	You lose!
945520	946560	Good day, sir!
956720	958480	What is wrong with this picture?
967600	969440	Oh, you stupid son of a-
972560	975360	And so the Democrats are trapped right now
975360	978320	in a downward spiral of just being negative and hostile.
978320	979280	Downward spiral.
979280	980240	Downward spiral.
980240	980880	Downward spiral.
980880	984080	The Democrats are in a downward spiral.
991520	994640	Funding for meme theory is provided by
994640	996640	FUCKING NO ONE
996640	1000800	Well, I guess now's the time to open up a Patreon and horror the shit out of my fans.
1002800	1008480	We so bad! We so bad! We so bad! We so bad!
1008480	1009520	Get off the stage!
1028000	1031040	So let's talk about Anthony Fantano for a little bit.
1031840	1038960	I mentioned him before in this video.
1038960	1043360	He's the creator of THE MEAN REVIEW on his channel That Is The Plan
1043360	1046640	along with his more popular music review channel The Needle Drop.
1046640	1049840	Now, I consider Anthony Fantano to be a really underrated
1049840	1052800	and underappreciated YouTuber in the grand scheme of things.
1052800	1056880	What I see when I look at his content is a really intelligent and level-headed guy
1056880	1061680	who churns out consistently good content and has been doing so for several years.
1061760	1067200	He strikes me as a very unique YouTube reviewer in both his editing style and commentary.
1067200	1072320	Most media reviewers on YouTube get popular by being scathingly negative and bitter towards
1072320	1076640	what they're reviewing because YouTube audiences generally love to hate on stuff.
1076640	1080480	As a matter of fact, I'm gonna predict that this video is gonna get a shitload of views
1080480	1082640	because I'm being critical of another YouTuber.
1082640	1088320	But Anthony Fantano has taken the approach of being much more mellow and reasonable in his views.
1088320	1092160	Honestly, it's refreshing to see this calmer attitude amidst the oversaturated
1092160	1094880	I'M PISSED OFF gimmick of YouTube reviewers.
1094880	1097760	He also gives the impression of being genuine and down-to-earth.
1097760	1102160	You can tell he actually cares about his content and believes what he's saying in his videos.
1102160	1104880	It's important to note that last year when it was really
1104880	1108560	trendy to shit on Leafy after iDubbbz made the Leafy Content Cop,
1108560	1112000	Anthony Fantano made a video criticizing both iDubbbz and Leafy
1112000	1114560	rather than cashing in on the Leafy hate train.
1114560	1119840	This incident really cemented in my mind that Anthony Fantano values speaking honestly
1119840	1123360	more than YouTube success, which is a really admirable trait.
1123360	1130240	But to be honest, the best aspect of Anthony Fantano's reviews is that he knows his shit.
1130800	1134400	Whether it's a music or meme review, you get a strong impression
1134400	1137360	that Anthony Fantano knows what the fuck he's talking about.
1137360	1142080	And that's the primary reason why me and a lot of other people respect him so much.
1142080	1146960	So when he notices this guy called Behind The Meme, who doesn't actually know jack shit about
1146960	1152400	memes, make a series very similar to his, and people are actually listening to him and watching
1152400	1157760	his content, he gets upset. So Anthony Fantano decides to release the equivalent of a diss track.
1162880	1165760	I like memes, you guys. Please accept me.
1165760	1170000	This is the part of the video where I regurgitate information I found on Know Your Meme,
1170000	1172480	but you're so stupid, you think I researched it.
1172480	1175680	And please make sure you subscribe so you can watch my next video,
1175680	1179600	because lord knows nobody is watching my videos on my other YouTube channel.
1179600	1184160	This is really my last-ditch effort at YouTube relevance, guys, so please.
1185200	1186640	God, please.
1186640	1189520	And I'll admit, he fucking hammers behind the meme here.
1189520	1191760	It's more savage than fucking Randy.
1191760	1204400	How are you gonna like it when you get some of your own medicine from Mama Memes?
1205760	1212400	Oh, dude, I understand the orange cap.
1217200	1218080	The fuck?
1218080	1221040	You know what? I went to school with a lot of people like that.
1221680	1224800	Even, you know, even where I went to school, they had geeks.
1224800	1226000	That looks like a geek.
1230320	1232560	You want to explain to me what you're doing here?
1232560	1236720	All kidding aside, you're a good guy. You have some funny stuff.
1236720	1240880	Stop, stop, pretty cute people. Do what you're good at.
1240880	1244000	Stop, pretty cute people. Do what you're good at.
1244000	1256640	Stop, pretty cute people.
1274000	1284800	The only thing you're good at is being a little bitch.
1285520	1290640	Stop being a little bitch.
1293520	1298160	You see, Anthony Fantano had put behind the meme in a lose-lose situation,
1298160	1302560	but by far the most favorable route that behind the meme could have taken was to
1302560	1308160	ignore the parody video and disassociate himself from Anthony Fantano as much as possible.
1308160	1312080	But, as you might have guessed, behind the meme chose the worst possible outcome
1312080	1315040	by directly responding through a video upload.
1315040	1319200	Now, this was a stupidly bad mistake by behind the meme, and here's why.
1319200	1323520	First of all, he immediately made an enemy out of Anthony Fantano's fans,
1323520	1326720	and the fans of the meme review are generally outsiders,
1326720	1331840	the people you need to like you if you want to be respected as a meme channel on YouTube.
1331840	1337280	By choosing to respond to Anthony Fantano, behind the meme automatically and permanently
1337280	1341360	established himself as a pro-normie and anti-outsider channel.
1341360	1345040	Additionally, in doing this, behind the meme branded himself as a competitor
1345040	1347840	and rival to Anthony Fantano rather than an ally,
1347840	1350960	and he basically entered a battle which he cannot win.
1350960	1356640	Behind the meme is less clever, less original, and knows less about memes than Anthony Fantano,
1356640	1359920	so he can't possibly expect to come out of this on top.
1359920	1362880	And when I say come out on top, I'm not talking about subscribers.
1362880	1365040	I'm talking about being respected.
1365040	1369520	Leafy has a lot of subscribers, and he's generally maligned by pretty much everyone.
1369520	1374080	I've said this lots of times before, but sub count really doesn't matter on YouTube,
1374080	1379360	and by disputing Anthony Fantano, behind the meme set himself up to be hated.
1379360	1383760	That's a stupid decision that can only be made by a stupid idiot.
1383760	1384720	You dumbass!
1384720	1386160	But wait, there's more!
1386160	1386880	Uh-oh.
1386880	1389120	Looks like the message didn't quite get through.
1389920	1397520	So, out of everything we've covered already,
1397520	1400320	this is the thing that really pissed me off the most.
1400320	1402720	So this time, instead of responding to a YouTuber,
1402720	1406640	behind the meme literally responds to a 4chan post.
1406640	1409840	Like, how petty can you possibly fucking be?
1409840	1414320	Do you honestly have to respond to every ounce of criticism you receive on the internet?
1414320	1415760	Are you that fucking insecure?
1415760	1419440	Zinzi is an attempt to get me to make a video on a meme that makes no sense
1419440	1423120	and really doesn't exist, so I look like a fool and lose credibility.
1424880	1426640	Hey, behind the meme,
1426640	1429360	here's a little bit of information that you may have missed
1429360	1431920	because you weren't able to read it off of Know Your Meme.
1431920	1438400	The people of 4chan hate and make fun of everybody, especially normies like you.
1438400	1443840	Did you seriously expect them to welcome your bastardization of memes with open arms?
1443840	1445440	Are you really that dense?
1445520	1448240	Yes, there are people who will dislike you on the internet.
1448240	1450240	It's an inevitability.
1450240	1455920	Being upset at 4chan for being mean to you is like being mad at a bear for shitting in the woods.
1455920	1458800	And the worst part is that everyone in the comments are supporting him.
1458800	1461440	Way to go behind the meme, you really showed them.
1461440	1464640	Way to criticize a site that literally makes fun of itself.
1464640	1470080	Is everybody just completely oblivious to how fundamentally flawed the message of this video is?
1470080	1473920	He complains about 4chan being elitist when it comes to memes.
1473920	1477840	You see, some people on the internet like to act like elitist when it comes to memes.
1477840	1478960	Well, of course they are.
1478960	1482800	4chan ain't good for much, but they churn out some fucking good memes.
1504320	1507440	The people of 4chan live and breathe memetics.
1507440	1509840	Look at the way they speak, the pictures they post.
1509840	1514800	No other site on the internet is as adept at utilizing memetics as 4chan.
1514800	1517200	So of course they're fucking elitist about memes,
1517200	1520320	just like how Michael Jordan is elitist about basketball.
1520320	1523280	When you're that good at something, you deserve to be arrogant.
1523280	1526480	And then you're upset that they're complaining about you,
1526480	1528320	someone who knows nothing about memes,
1528320	1533200	exposing the memes that they created to an audience of normies whom they despise.
1533200	1535520	And here we arrive at the main point of this video.
1542000	1545680	The existence and continuation of Behind the Memes channel
1545680	1548720	is dismantling and destroying the culture of memes,
1548720	1552320	which has been delicately constructed over the course of two decades.
1552320	1555200	He's acting like such a hero, such a saint.
1555200	1560480	Oh, I'm educating those poor unfortunate normies who can't learn about memes for themselves,
1560480	1563120	all so that they don't have to feel left out.
1563120	1566880	Subscribe to Behind the Meme and never feel left out again.
1566880	1568400	I'm the good guy here.
1568400	1570640	Okay there chief, hold the fuck up for a second.
1570640	1574640	You're not devoting your time and effort to teach impoverished schoolchildren in Africa.
1574640	1576640	You're talking about memes on the internet.
1576640	1579040	You're not exactly humanitarian of the year here.
1579040	1584080	These poor unfortunate people you claim to be helping have access to the internet too,
1584080	1585200	you do realize that.
1585200	1587440	They can become an expert in any meme they want,
1587440	1591120	but the truth is they're all lazy and they prefer to be spoon fed
1591120	1595680	with unchallenging and generic content like the normies they are.
1595680	1599600	And others shouldn't feel dumb when they see a new meme and don't exactly get the joke.
1599600	1600080	Wrong.
1600080	1603120	You see, back in the day, only the most ambitious meme seekers
1603120	1608320	could actually take the patience and time to learn about memes and meme culture on their own.
1608320	1611600	This system allowed the meme economy to be sustainable
1611600	1613760	because the only people who had access to memes
1613760	1617600	were those who were willing to actually go out and investigate them on their own.
1617600	1620960	Memes were consumed more slowly and they lasted longer.
1621040	1622480	Now, thanks to behind the meme,
1622480	1626720	everyone can have a superficial understanding of memes and overuse them as much as they want.
1626720	1627680	Isn't that great?
1627680	1628800	Wait, it's not.
1628800	1630560	Because when everyone knows about a meme,
1630560	1635040	it becomes so deluded that no one wants to use the meme anymore and it dies.
1635040	1638720	You're basically inviting all these normie children to piss in our meme pool.
1638720	1641280	You force everyone else to jump to cleaner water
1641280	1644640	while you make your area so insufferably full of piss
1644640	1647920	that eventually no one, not even normies, want to swim in them.
1647920	1650160	And this just keeps happening faster and faster.
1650160	1653040	The meme economy isn't sustainable anymore.
1653040	1655440	And soon, we're gonna run out of clean water.
1655440	1658960	You have any idea how much faster memes die nowadays?
1658960	1662800	For someone who claims to love memes so much, you really don't seem to care.
1662800	1666480	As a matter of fact, you don't even seem to be aware of what you're doing.
1666480	1669600	I like how you tell 4chan to look at the bigger picture.
1669600	1672560	But if they would take a step back and look at the big picture of things,
1672560	1674480	they would see that I'm just a teacher.
1674480	1677120	As if you understand memes better than they do.
1677120	1680640	But guys, I'm totally part of your community and I have been for years.
1680640	1684160	The thing is, all those who hate on my channel should be happy it's me.
1684160	1687200	I've been a part of your communities and forums for years.
1687200	1688320	I am one of you.
1689200	1691600	And this is the worst part of it all behind the meme
1691600	1694720	because you claim to be just like us, the outsiders.
1694720	1696160	But you're not like us.
1696160	1698960	You are a normie.
1699520	1701360	Just like your fan base.
1701360	1704080	So stop lying to us and lying to yourself.
1704080	1706000	Anthony Fantano is an outsider.
1706000	1708560	The people of 4chan are outsiders.
1708560	1711200	You, behind the meme, are a normie.
1711200	1714720	And it doesn't matter how much you pretend to be such a meme expert.
1714720	1720480	You make it apparent that you're a normie through your bland, unchallenging, and generic videos.
1720480	1724560	You try to be like Anthony Fantano, but end up being like WatchMojo.
1724560	1726960	Because you lack the creativity and wit
1726960	1732720	to differentiate yourself from the most ordinary dime-a-dozen YouTube content clones.
1732720	1734800	You are not distinct.
1734880	1740000	Anyone could replace you and half of your fans wouldn't even notice or care.
1740000	1743520	And if that wasn't enough, you want everyone to be just like you.
1743520	1749040	And you simply cannot fathom a world where people disagree with your flawed concept of memes.
1749040	1752800	So you seek to belittle, condescend, and patronize them.
1752800	1755920	And even worse is that you use this fake persona
1755920	1760400	to give yourself a scrap of legitimacy towards educating people about memes
1760400	1762720	when you don't know anything about them.
1762720	1766000	And you end up feeding them superficial and inaccurate information
1766000	1769440	leading to even more people like you who think they know memes,
1769440	1772240	but actually don't know jack shit.
1772240	1774880	But hey, that's the internet for ya.
1774880	1779440	And on the internet, ignorance is king.
1779440	1794720	So I just want to take these last few minutes to tie up some loose ends.
1794720	1797920	First of all, I want to say that I do not hate behind the meme.
1797920	1801600	I just hate this idea that what he's doing is perfectly okay
1801600	1806240	and that we have some sort of obligation to make sure that no Normie gets left behind.
1806240	1810400	No, he has to understand that there are negative consequences to what he's doing.
1810400	1814160	However, I do not view him as someone with malicious intent.
1814160	1818000	Rather, I view him as someone who misunderstands his role in the meme-scape.
1818000	1821840	I'm not opposed either to the idea of Normies learning about memes.
1821840	1823680	I just think you have to be careful about it
1823680	1827120	and actually do a good job of explaining the memes and their context.
1827120	1831200	I think it's better to try to bring Normies up to our level rather than sinking to theirs.
1831200	1833040	The Meme Review does a good job of this,
1833040	1836400	and I would highly recommend people watch that instead of Behind the Meme.
1836400	1841520	But the fact of the matter is that Behind the Meme has a wider appeal than the Meme Review ever could
1841520	1843680	simply because of the nature of Normies.
1843680	1847520	All I know is that you never see the Meme Review on the YouTube Trending tab.
1847520	1852720	It's frustrating how YouTube is systematically favoring an inferior meme series.
1852720	1856720	But it's what Normies want to see, and it's what gets views.
1856720	1860720	And that's the bottom line on YouTube, so there's nothing we can really do about it.
1860720	1864400	I understand that he's a Normie trying to dictate an outsider culture,
1864400	1869680	but I also understand that the meme-scape is constantly evolving and it's impossible to fight it.
1869680	1873600	Perhaps what is happening now is just part of the natural progression of memes,
1873600	1876160	but we can't really tell for sure either way.
1876160	1880160	Finally, I understand that this video is going to get me hated by a lot of people,
1880160	1882080	and that's a consequence I'm willing to accept.
1882080	1886320	My goal with this video is not to start YouTube drama nor expose a YouTuber.
1886320	1889440	My goal with this video is to explain a perspective.
1889440	1893440	A perspective which is unclear and overlooked by many people.
1893440	1896800	I feel like there are a lot of misconceptions about memes out there,
1896800	1900720	and I want to continue this series to make as much sense of it as I can.
1900720	1903520	Because if there's one thing I learned while making this video,
1903520	1907120	it's that people in general really don't know much about memes.
1907120	1911760	The meme-scape today is incredibly deep and complex, and it changes every day.
1911760	1914640	There are so many components that have yet to be explored,
1914640	1918400	and I think all of us could try to understand it better, including me.
1918400	1921520	But hey, that's why it's just a theory!
1921520	1923280	A meme theory!
1923840	1926000	Thanks for unsubscribing!
