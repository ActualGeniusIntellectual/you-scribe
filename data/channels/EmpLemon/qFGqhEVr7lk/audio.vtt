00:00.000 --> 00:01.200
About it, G.

00:01.200 --> 00:16.000
Hello, Internet, and welcome to Meme Theory, where Behind the Meme has become an epidemic.

00:16.000 --> 00:19.200
Okay, I'm just gonna cut right to the chase here.

00:19.200 --> 00:23.200
Dear Behind the Meme, enough is enough!

00:23.200 --> 00:30.000
I have had it with these motherfucking Normies talking about my motherfucking memes!

00:30.000 --> 00:32.960
Hey everybody, welcome back to another episode of Content Cuck.

00:33.680 --> 00:39.040
Empdubs here, and this is the definitive Behind the Meme rant video.

00:39.040 --> 00:40.400
Who is Behind the Meme?

00:40.400 --> 00:44.400
Well, he's a YouTube channel that's become fairly popular over the last few months.

00:44.400 --> 00:46.960
A lot of people like him, but a lot of people don't.

00:46.960 --> 00:49.360
And I'm part of the ones who don't.

00:49.360 --> 00:54.160
And I don't really think he or his Normie fans understand why.

00:54.160 --> 00:57.680
I don't understand why I'm still getting hates.

00:57.680 --> 01:02.640
So allow me, a guy who actually knows a thing or two about meme culture,

01:02.640 --> 01:05.360
to explain to you guys exactly how Behind the Meme

01:05.360 --> 01:08.400
is fucking up the entirety of the memescape as we know it.

01:11.280 --> 01:14.160
First, I'm going to give you guys a little bit of background information.

01:14.160 --> 01:17.360
So in this video, you're going to hear me use the term Normie a lot.

01:17.360 --> 01:21.280
So allow me to explain my definition of this term through this little analogy.

01:21.280 --> 01:25.680
Basically, in the age of modern mass media, I'm talking about 1980s onwards,

01:25.680 --> 01:30.960
you can divide media consumers into two main groups, the Normies and the outsiders.

01:30.960 --> 01:36.960
The Normies are and have always been the majority, the mainstream, the hump of the bell curve.

01:36.960 --> 01:41.520
If you're a TV or film or music producer, the Normies are generally where the money is.

01:41.520 --> 01:45.600
Therefore, the vast majority of content seen in mass media is dictated by

01:45.680 --> 01:52.320
and targeted towards Normies, or at least that's how it was before the age of the internet.

01:53.200 --> 01:57.280
You see, 65 million years ago, the dinosaurs reigned supreme.

01:57.280 --> 02:00.480
Then a big ol' asteroid hit the planet and killed the dinosaurs.

02:00.480 --> 02:06.640
And left to inhabit the scorched earth were these small, crafty, quirky animals called mammals,

02:06.640 --> 02:10.560
but left to develop on their own with a few million years of evolution.

02:10.560 --> 02:13.760
And I'd say us mammals are doing pretty good for ourselves.

02:13.760 --> 02:16.000
A lot better than those dinosaurs everywhere.

02:23.120 --> 02:27.360
You see, the Normies are the dinosaurs of consumer society,

02:27.360 --> 02:32.720
the outsiders are the mammals, and the birth of the World Wide Web was the asteroid.

02:44.480 --> 02:48.480
The outsiders include anyone who rejects mainstream media in favor of content

02:48.480 --> 02:51.920
which matches their more niche and unconventional tastes.

02:51.920 --> 02:55.680
In the 80s, the outsiders were mocked and outcast by the Normies,

02:55.680 --> 02:59.680
only able to seek safety in the odd comic book store or sci-fi convention.

03:01.760 --> 03:04.800
But then, in the 90s, this thing called the internet happened.

03:08.160 --> 03:11.120
Imagine a world where every word ever written,

03:11.120 --> 03:14.320
every picture ever painted, and every film ever shot

03:14.320 --> 03:19.040
could be viewed instantly in your home via an information superhighway.

03:19.040 --> 03:21.360
So, the Normies see this and they're like,

03:21.360 --> 03:25.520
hey, this isn't MTV Jurassic Park or Pokemon, get that shit out of my face.

03:25.520 --> 03:29.200
But for the outsiders, the internet was paradise.

03:29.200 --> 03:33.360
Here you had an open, unregulated global platform on which you could post

03:33.360 --> 03:35.840
and search for whatever odd stuff you wanted,

03:35.840 --> 03:38.800
and there were no Normies around to ostracize you for it.

03:38.800 --> 03:42.400
And not only that, but now you can connect with people from around the world,

03:42.400 --> 03:46.880
people you didn't even know existed, who had the same weird and bizarre tastes as you.

03:46.880 --> 03:48.960
Because on the internet, anything goes.

03:48.960 --> 03:52.400
It's like the Wild West, or in this case, the Wild Web.

03:52.400 --> 03:56.800
So, for a little bit, Normies and outsiders could both enjoy their own media in peace.

03:56.800 --> 04:01.200
The outsiders had the Wild Web and the Normies had the mainstream metropolis.

04:01.200 --> 04:05.760
And for a time, they existed, balanced, two sides of a coin in harmony.

04:05.760 --> 04:08.720
Then everything changed when the Normies attacked.

04:08.720 --> 04:23.440
It's ironic, actually, how it's typically the Normies that make fun of the outsiders

04:23.440 --> 04:26.720
for liking the media that we do, calling us weird and nerdy,

04:26.720 --> 04:30.560
when all along the outsiders have always had superior media.

04:30.560 --> 04:34.080
There was a time when reading comic books was considered super nerdy,

04:34.080 --> 04:38.320
and now comic book characters make up 90% of the blockbusters in cinemas.

04:38.320 --> 04:42.560
There was a time when playing video games meant you were a virgin living in your parents' basement,

04:42.560 --> 04:46.720
and now people are making millions of dollars in front of millions of fans

04:46.720 --> 04:48.800
playing video games for a living.

04:48.800 --> 04:52.400
You see, the critical factor that sets outsiders apart from Normies

04:52.400 --> 04:55.040
is that outsiders think outside the box.

04:55.040 --> 04:57.520
They're creative, contemplative, analytical.

04:57.520 --> 05:01.760
They aren't satisfied with anything less than original, ingenious content.

05:01.760 --> 05:06.560
This forces us to constantly innovate the media we consume and create.

05:06.560 --> 05:09.600
Outsiders like to go out and explore their media.

05:09.600 --> 05:14.480
Normies tend to want everything spoon-fed to them in a comfortable and unchallenging way.

05:14.480 --> 05:17.360
They love the same old patterns and formulas.

05:17.360 --> 05:19.280
If something works, why change it?

05:21.040 --> 05:22.480
Man, fall down.

05:23.600 --> 05:24.160
Funny.

05:26.160 --> 05:30.080
This causes Normie media to become incredibly inert and slow to change.

05:30.080 --> 05:33.840
The cycle usually repeats itself until whatever media at hand becomes so

05:33.840 --> 05:38.160
insufferably derivative and stale that even the Normies get sick of it.

05:39.360 --> 05:43.920
And as time goes on, the mainstream metropolis becomes more crowded and congested with

05:43.920 --> 05:46.560
tired trends and cringey cliches.

05:46.560 --> 05:49.840
And the more this goes on, the more the Normies want to get out.

05:49.840 --> 05:53.760
And that's when they notice the fertile open plains of the wild web.

05:57.200 --> 05:59.280
So much like video games and comic books,

05:59.280 --> 06:02.560
internet memes were once an outsider-exclusive media.

06:02.560 --> 06:06.000
They were a kind of way for people from all these sort of obscure and

06:06.000 --> 06:08.640
unconventional communities to communicate with one another.

06:08.640 --> 06:10.640
An outsider's language, if you will.

06:10.640 --> 06:13.760
Originally, memes were just a way for members of online communities and

06:13.760 --> 06:15.600
fandoms to identify each other.

06:15.600 --> 06:18.240
They weren't really meant to be widely understood.

06:18.240 --> 06:22.880
Many early internet memes were just taken directly out of context from their original media.

06:22.880 --> 06:27.360
So in order to understand the meme, you had to understand the media from which it came.

06:27.360 --> 06:28.960
There was a time when if you came across

06:33.200 --> 06:36.160
You either didn't understand the context and went on with your day,

06:36.160 --> 06:40.560
or you recognized that it was a World of Warcraft reference and you found it funny.

06:40.560 --> 06:45.920
This role-playing game out in 2004 returns to the world of Azeroth,

06:45.920 --> 06:48.480
where heroes like Leroy Jenkins do battle.

06:52.640 --> 06:54.800
And that would be the World of Warcraft.

06:57.360 --> 07:06.640
You established an immediate connection to whoever posted it,

07:06.640 --> 07:10.080
without having to exchange a single line of direct communication.

07:10.080 --> 07:14.400
Then somewhere along the way, the idea of an internet meme became a lot more meta.

07:14.400 --> 07:19.360
Memes stopped being attached to media, and rather they started becoming media in their own right.

07:19.360 --> 07:22.000
People started sharing memes because they were memes,

07:22.000 --> 07:24.960
rather than as a method for communicating within a fandom.

07:24.960 --> 07:27.760
This was the beginning of meme culture on the internet.

07:27.760 --> 07:31.280
So at this point, memes were still an outsider's media source.

07:31.280 --> 07:33.440
But since they were now their own media source,

07:33.440 --> 07:36.720
lots of people felt obligated to catalog and document them.

07:36.720 --> 07:40.880
This purpose was fulfilled through sites like Know Your Meme and Urban Dictionary,

07:40.880 --> 07:44.160
but we'll be focusing specifically on Know Your Meme for this video.

07:44.720 --> 07:47.920
Now, I have some pretty mixed opinions about Know Your Meme.

07:47.920 --> 07:52.560
On one hand, it's a decent resource for researching the origins and history behind certain memes.

07:52.560 --> 07:56.480
However, the articles on there can widely vary in quality,

07:56.480 --> 07:59.440
with many being outdated and missing critical information.

07:59.440 --> 08:02.640
Pages can also be pretty slow to update for new meme development,

08:02.640 --> 08:05.760
so use the site at your own risk to research memes.

08:05.760 --> 08:10.320
In my view, Know Your Meme is a good source for basic information on meme origins,

08:10.320 --> 08:14.560
but I wouldn't rely on it too much for perspective and overall understanding,

08:14.560 --> 08:17.920
which, unfortunately, a lot of people do.

08:17.920 --> 08:20.080
But I can't really blame them that much.

08:20.160 --> 08:25.520
Know Your Meme is the only real site where all the information about memes is located in one location.

08:25.520 --> 08:29.520
The site can be classified as a secondary source for meme information.

08:29.520 --> 08:32.800
They don't make the memes, they only write about them.

08:32.800 --> 08:34.880
Much like historical secondary sources,

08:34.880 --> 08:39.600
Know Your Meme is easier to access at the cost of information quality.

08:39.600 --> 08:43.840
It's not that much of a problem until you add an additional layer of separation

08:43.840 --> 08:45.440
between the viewer and the meme.

08:45.440 --> 08:47.600
That's where Behind the Meme comes in.

08:47.600 --> 08:52.000
Now that we've covered all the basics of your training,

08:52.000 --> 08:54.640
it's time for the moment you've been waiting for!

09:04.560 --> 09:09.280
So the premise of this YouTube channel is to host an educational series about memes.

09:09.280 --> 09:12.000
Okay, not a completely original idea, but okay.

09:12.000 --> 09:13.920
2016 was a big year for memes,

09:13.920 --> 09:17.840
and there was definitely a market for a series discussing and analyzing memes,

09:17.840 --> 09:20.480
which is why Anthony Fantano started the Meme Review.

09:20.480 --> 09:22.480
Oh wait, we're talking about Behind the Meme.

09:23.760 --> 09:27.440
Well, I'm sure there's room for a second meme discussion series on YouTube,

09:27.440 --> 09:31.760
but instead of being knowledgeable, or interesting, or well edited,

09:31.760 --> 09:34.240
or respectful of meme culture like Anthony Fantano,

09:34.240 --> 09:37.360
Behind the Meme decided to take the route of presenting his content

09:37.360 --> 09:40.320
in the most generic and bland way possible.

09:40.320 --> 09:41.760
Eye-catching thumbnails,

09:42.320 --> 09:44.160
look at me, look at me, look at me, look at me,

09:44.160 --> 09:45.600
stock photos and music,

09:51.760 --> 09:53.440
simple and slow editing,

09:53.440 --> 09:56.160
the patronizing YouTuber voice,

09:56.160 --> 10:00.560
and every video feels like an identical template with an interchangeable topic.

10:00.560 --> 10:02.800
He decides to employ all of these techniques

10:02.800 --> 10:06.560
because Behind the Meme is interested in targeting normies,

10:07.280 --> 10:09.360
Fucking normies!

10:09.360 --> 10:13.680
And since normies like unchallenging, basic, and repetitive content,

10:13.680 --> 10:15.360
that's what Behind the Meme supplies.

10:16.160 --> 10:19.440
Because what I see while looking at Behind the Meme's content in a vacuum

10:19.440 --> 10:22.560
is not a good YouTuber, not a bad YouTuber,

10:22.560 --> 10:25.280
but a mediocre YouTuber.

10:25.280 --> 10:29.040
Like the kind of kid who sits in class and does just enough to get a C-.

10:29.760 --> 10:32.560
He knows that if he applied himself he could probably get a solid B,

10:32.560 --> 10:33.760
or maybe even an A-.

10:33.840 --> 10:37.440
But no, he would just rather not spend the extra effort or passion.

10:37.440 --> 10:40.480
Because hey, a C- has a passing grade after all.

10:40.480 --> 10:43.200
C is average, the middle of the bell curve,

10:43.200 --> 10:47.120
which not so coincidentally is where his fan base lies.

10:50.160 --> 10:55.040
So let's actually look at one of his videos and see just how mediocre Behind the Meme is

10:55.040 --> 10:58.000
at actually doing his channel's self-professed purpose

10:58.000 --> 11:00.400
and educating people about memes.

11:00.400 --> 11:02.640
We're gonna watch the one about YouTube poops.

11:02.640 --> 11:03.120
Why?

11:03.120 --> 11:06.480
Because boy, I've been making fucking YouTube poops for seven years.

11:06.480 --> 11:08.720
I know my fucking shit, okay?

11:08.720 --> 11:11.280
Let's see how much Behind the Meme knows.

11:11.280 --> 11:14.160
Now, I'll admit, when I first saw this video in my feed,

11:14.160 --> 11:15.520
I actually got pretty excited.

11:15.520 --> 11:17.120
This guy's got a pretty big fan base,

11:17.120 --> 11:20.400
so it'll be great to expose them to YouTube poops.

11:20.400 --> 11:24.640
But then I actually watched the video and my enthusiasm went on a downward spiral.

11:24.640 --> 11:28.080
Hello internet, and welcome to Behind the Meme.

11:28.080 --> 11:31.120
So the video starts off with 30 seconds of intro processions

11:31.120 --> 11:33.840
that are copy and pasted between every video.

11:33.840 --> 11:35.920
Here we go.

11:35.920 --> 11:40.080
YouTube poop, YouTube poop, YouTube poop.

11:40.080 --> 11:43.120
Then another minute of beating around the bush with corny jokes

11:43.120 --> 11:45.200
without actually explaining anything.

11:45.200 --> 11:47.760
And then finally, one minute and 30 seconds in,

11:47.760 --> 11:50.480
we get Behind the Meme's definition of YouTube poop.

11:50.480 --> 11:53.040
So let's have a look at a couple definitions.

11:53.040 --> 11:57.280
Which he literally reads verbatim off of Know Your Meme and Wikipedia.

11:57.280 --> 12:00.800
Come on, dude, at least be discreet about your complete lack of knowledge

12:00.800 --> 12:03.120
or effort for researching this topic.

12:03.120 --> 12:04.480
So for the next minute or so,

12:04.480 --> 12:07.360
he just summarizes the Know Your Meme page on YouTube poops,

12:07.360 --> 12:09.760
which, by the way, is extremely outdated.

12:09.760 --> 12:10.960
And during this whole time,

12:10.960 --> 12:14.240
he's just showing basic reaction GIFs and stock images

12:14.240 --> 12:17.520
when he could be showing, I don't know, actual YouTube poops.

12:17.520 --> 12:19.360
He literally said like a minute earlier

12:19.360 --> 12:21.920
that YouTube poops were super duper hard to explain.

12:21.920 --> 12:25.840
Trying to say is defining YouTube poop is kind of possible,

12:25.840 --> 12:27.920
but at the same time impossible.

12:27.920 --> 12:30.720
So why not show some instead of just explaining them?

12:30.720 --> 12:32.720
But wait, showing YouTube poops

12:32.720 --> 12:35.840
would put you at a tiny risk of getting copyright claimed.

12:35.840 --> 12:36.880
Can't have that happen.

12:36.880 --> 12:38.960
So I guess you might as well give your fans

12:38.960 --> 12:41.520
as little visual information as possible

12:41.520 --> 12:43.760
about this incredibly complex topic

12:43.760 --> 12:46.640
which you're describing on your educational YouTube channel.

12:46.640 --> 12:48.880
So then he gets the part where he goes over poopisms.

12:48.880 --> 12:52.480
Some of the defining poopisms that the videos use are ear rape,

12:52.480 --> 12:56.160
which is the process of making the audio loud to the point of distortion.

12:56.160 --> 12:58.320
Wow, what an ear rape you pulled off.

12:58.400 --> 13:00.880
Crank that shit up, you fucking pussy!

13:00.880 --> 13:05.600
Oh wait, you don't want to hurt the ears of your oh-so-fragile normie fan base.

13:05.600 --> 13:08.480
If you used actual ear rape, people might unsubscribe.

13:08.480 --> 13:10.000
Oh, by the way, that reminds me.

13:10.000 --> 13:11.840
Can you unsubscribe?

13:11.840 --> 13:14.560
So then he mentions reversing and stutter loops,

13:14.560 --> 13:17.200
techniques which have literally been around since World War II.

13:24.880 --> 13:26.640
Seriously, everyone knows this shit already.

13:26.640 --> 13:30.080
How about mentioning some more nuanced techniques like sentence mixing?

13:30.080 --> 13:32.320
And also sentence shifting.

13:32.320 --> 13:34.160
Sentence shifting.

13:34.160 --> 13:36.240
You have got to be fucking kidding me.

13:41.440 --> 13:47.360
So he continues reading off of Know Your Meme until finally he shows a YouTube poop.

13:47.360 --> 13:48.080
Whoa!

13:48.080 --> 13:50.000
And it's hot on our tail.

13:50.000 --> 13:53.600
Now don't get me wrong, I don't have anything against this YouTube poop.

13:53.600 --> 13:56.080
It's a really important part of YouTube poop history,

13:56.080 --> 13:59.120
but imagine the people in Behind the Meme's audience

13:59.120 --> 14:02.640
who have never seen a YouTube poop before in their entire lives.

14:02.640 --> 14:05.120
And this is the first YouTube poop they see

14:05.120 --> 14:09.040
from which they have to conceptualize what all other poops are like.

14:09.040 --> 14:13.120
It's the equivalent of taking someone who has no idea what an automobile is

14:13.120 --> 14:15.360
and in order to demonstrate an example of one,

14:15.360 --> 14:19.760
you show them the 1886 Mercedes-Benz patent motor wagon.

14:19.760 --> 14:27.040
The fuck is this?

14:27.040 --> 14:29.040
Sure, it's technically an automobile,

14:29.040 --> 14:31.600
and it's really important to the history of automobiles.

14:31.600 --> 14:34.160
But to a person who knows nothing about automobiles,

14:34.160 --> 14:35.920
it looks awkward and stupid,

14:35.920 --> 14:39.040
and makes them question why anyone likes automobiles at all.

14:39.040 --> 14:42.240
That's the type of impression Behind the Meme is giving by literally

14:42.240 --> 14:45.440
only showing one poop as an example and nothing else.

14:45.440 --> 14:48.800
And then he talks for a bit about YTPMVs and says they're

14:48.880 --> 14:53.680
the same concept as the regular poop edits but only with the addition of music.

14:53.680 --> 14:57.120
Which is a gross, gross overgeneralization.

14:57.120 --> 15:00.800
Then he says YTPs are important because they're the grandfather of memes.

15:00.800 --> 15:05.280
The YouTube poop videos are kind of like the grandfather of today's memes.

15:05.280 --> 15:08.720
Which is also inaccurate in pretty much every aspect

15:08.720 --> 15:12.800
and demonstrates a complete lack of knowledge about the true depth of internet meme history.

15:12.800 --> 15:14.960
And that's the end of the video.

15:14.960 --> 15:16.640
Six and a half minutes.

15:16.640 --> 15:19.600
Four minutes of which were actually spent discussing YouTube poop.

15:19.600 --> 15:22.880
And through all of it, he didn't actually explain anything.

15:22.880 --> 15:27.360
If anything, he actually made people more ignorant to what YTP actually is.

15:27.360 --> 15:32.000
All he did was read some definitions and define some terms off of an outdated web page.

15:32.000 --> 15:34.240
There's pretty much no analysis whatsoever.

15:34.240 --> 15:37.280
He mentions nothing about different styles and methodologies.

15:37.280 --> 15:39.040
How YouTube poops are entertaining.

15:39.040 --> 15:41.840
The incredible evolution of the medium over the past decade.

15:41.840 --> 15:44.000
You get nothing!

15:44.000 --> 15:44.800
You lose!

15:45.520 --> 15:46.560
Good day, sir!

15:56.720 --> 15:58.480
What is wrong with this picture?

16:07.600 --> 16:09.440
Oh, you stupid son of a-

16:12.560 --> 16:15.360
And so the Democrats are trapped right now

16:15.360 --> 16:18.320
in a downward spiral of just being negative and hostile.

16:18.320 --> 16:19.280
Downward spiral.

16:19.280 --> 16:20.240
Downward spiral.

16:20.240 --> 16:20.880
Downward spiral.

16:20.880 --> 16:24.080
The Democrats are in a downward spiral.

16:31.520 --> 16:34.640
Funding for meme theory is provided by

16:34.640 --> 16:36.640
FUCKING NO ONE

16:36.640 --> 16:40.800
Well, I guess now's the time to open up a Patreon and horror the shit out of my fans.

16:42.800 --> 16:48.480
We so bad! We so bad! We so bad! We so bad!

16:48.480 --> 16:49.520
Get off the stage!

17:08.000 --> 17:11.040
So let's talk about Anthony Fantano for a little bit.

17:11.840 --> 17:18.960
I mentioned him before in this video.

17:18.960 --> 17:23.360
He's the creator of THE MEAN REVIEW on his channel That Is The Plan

17:23.360 --> 17:26.640
along with his more popular music review channel The Needle Drop.

17:26.640 --> 17:29.840
Now, I consider Anthony Fantano to be a really underrated

17:29.840 --> 17:32.800
and underappreciated YouTuber in the grand scheme of things.

17:32.800 --> 17:36.880
What I see when I look at his content is a really intelligent and level-headed guy

17:36.880 --> 17:41.680
who churns out consistently good content and has been doing so for several years.

17:41.760 --> 17:47.200
He strikes me as a very unique YouTube reviewer in both his editing style and commentary.

17:47.200 --> 17:52.320
Most media reviewers on YouTube get popular by being scathingly negative and bitter towards

17:52.320 --> 17:56.640
what they're reviewing because YouTube audiences generally love to hate on stuff.

17:56.640 --> 18:00.480
As a matter of fact, I'm gonna predict that this video is gonna get a shitload of views

18:00.480 --> 18:02.640
because I'm being critical of another YouTuber.

18:02.640 --> 18:08.320
But Anthony Fantano has taken the approach of being much more mellow and reasonable in his views.

18:08.320 --> 18:12.160
Honestly, it's refreshing to see this calmer attitude amidst the oversaturated

18:12.160 --> 18:14.880
I'M PISSED OFF gimmick of YouTube reviewers.

18:14.880 --> 18:17.760
He also gives the impression of being genuine and down-to-earth.

18:17.760 --> 18:22.160
You can tell he actually cares about his content and believes what he's saying in his videos.

18:22.160 --> 18:24.880
It's important to note that last year when it was really

18:24.880 --> 18:28.560
trendy to shit on Leafy after iDubbbz made the Leafy Content Cop,

18:28.560 --> 18:32.000
Anthony Fantano made a video criticizing both iDubbbz and Leafy

18:32.000 --> 18:34.560
rather than cashing in on the Leafy hate train.

18:34.560 --> 18:39.840
This incident really cemented in my mind that Anthony Fantano values speaking honestly

18:39.840 --> 18:43.360
more than YouTube success, which is a really admirable trait.

18:43.360 --> 18:50.240
But to be honest, the best aspect of Anthony Fantano's reviews is that he knows his shit.

18:50.800 --> 18:54.400
Whether it's a music or meme review, you get a strong impression

18:54.400 --> 18:57.360
that Anthony Fantano knows what the fuck he's talking about.

18:57.360 --> 19:02.080
And that's the primary reason why me and a lot of other people respect him so much.

19:02.080 --> 19:06.960
So when he notices this guy called Behind The Meme, who doesn't actually know jack shit about

19:06.960 --> 19:12.400
memes, make a series very similar to his, and people are actually listening to him and watching

19:12.400 --> 19:17.760
his content, he gets upset. So Anthony Fantano decides to release the equivalent of a diss track.

19:22.880 --> 19:25.760
I like memes, you guys. Please accept me.

19:25.760 --> 19:30.000
This is the part of the video where I regurgitate information I found on Know Your Meme,

19:30.000 --> 19:32.480
but you're so stupid, you think I researched it.

19:32.480 --> 19:35.680
And please make sure you subscribe so you can watch my next video,

19:35.680 --> 19:39.600
because lord knows nobody is watching my videos on my other YouTube channel.

19:39.600 --> 19:44.160
This is really my last-ditch effort at YouTube relevance, guys, so please.

19:45.200 --> 19:46.640
God, please.

19:46.640 --> 19:49.520
And I'll admit, he fucking hammers behind the meme here.

19:49.520 --> 19:51.760
It's more savage than fucking Randy.

19:51.760 --> 20:04.400
How are you gonna like it when you get some of your own medicine from Mama Memes?

20:05.760 --> 20:12.400
Oh, dude, I understand the orange cap.

20:17.200 --> 20:18.080
The fuck?

20:18.080 --> 20:21.040
You know what? I went to school with a lot of people like that.

20:21.680 --> 20:24.800
Even, you know, even where I went to school, they had geeks.

20:24.800 --> 20:26.000
That looks like a geek.

20:30.320 --> 20:32.560
You want to explain to me what you're doing here?

20:32.560 --> 20:36.720
All kidding aside, you're a good guy. You have some funny stuff.

20:36.720 --> 20:40.880
Stop, stop, pretty cute people. Do what you're good at.

20:40.880 --> 20:44.000
Stop, pretty cute people. Do what you're good at.

20:44.000 --> 20:56.640
Stop, pretty cute people.

21:14.000 --> 21:24.800
The only thing you're good at is being a little bitch.

21:25.520 --> 21:30.640
Stop being a little bitch.

21:33.520 --> 21:38.160
You see, Anthony Fantano had put behind the meme in a lose-lose situation,

21:38.160 --> 21:42.560
but by far the most favorable route that behind the meme could have taken was to

21:42.560 --> 21:48.160
ignore the parody video and disassociate himself from Anthony Fantano as much as possible.

21:48.160 --> 21:52.080
But, as you might have guessed, behind the meme chose the worst possible outcome

21:52.080 --> 21:55.040
by directly responding through a video upload.

21:55.040 --> 21:59.200
Now, this was a stupidly bad mistake by behind the meme, and here's why.

21:59.200 --> 22:03.520
First of all, he immediately made an enemy out of Anthony Fantano's fans,

22:03.520 --> 22:06.720
and the fans of the meme review are generally outsiders,

22:06.720 --> 22:11.840
the people you need to like you if you want to be respected as a meme channel on YouTube.

22:11.840 --> 22:17.280
By choosing to respond to Anthony Fantano, behind the meme automatically and permanently

22:17.280 --> 22:21.360
established himself as a pro-normie and anti-outsider channel.

22:21.360 --> 22:25.040
Additionally, in doing this, behind the meme branded himself as a competitor

22:25.040 --> 22:27.840
and rival to Anthony Fantano rather than an ally,

22:27.840 --> 22:30.960
and he basically entered a battle which he cannot win.

22:30.960 --> 22:36.640
Behind the meme is less clever, less original, and knows less about memes than Anthony Fantano,

22:36.640 --> 22:39.920
so he can't possibly expect to come out of this on top.

22:39.920 --> 22:42.880
And when I say come out on top, I'm not talking about subscribers.

22:42.880 --> 22:45.040
I'm talking about being respected.

22:45.040 --> 22:49.520
Leafy has a lot of subscribers, and he's generally maligned by pretty much everyone.

22:49.520 --> 22:54.080
I've said this lots of times before, but sub count really doesn't matter on YouTube,

22:54.080 --> 22:59.360
and by disputing Anthony Fantano, behind the meme set himself up to be hated.

22:59.360 --> 23:03.760
That's a stupid decision that can only be made by a stupid idiot.

23:03.760 --> 23:04.720
You dumbass!

23:04.720 --> 23:06.160
But wait, there's more!

23:06.160 --> 23:06.880
Uh-oh.

23:06.880 --> 23:09.120
Looks like the message didn't quite get through.

23:09.920 --> 23:17.520
So, out of everything we've covered already,

23:17.520 --> 23:20.320
this is the thing that really pissed me off the most.

23:20.320 --> 23:22.720
So this time, instead of responding to a YouTuber,

23:22.720 --> 23:26.640
behind the meme literally responds to a 4chan post.

23:26.640 --> 23:29.840
Like, how petty can you possibly fucking be?

23:29.840 --> 23:34.320
Do you honestly have to respond to every ounce of criticism you receive on the internet?

23:34.320 --> 23:35.760
Are you that fucking insecure?

23:35.760 --> 23:39.440
Zinzi is an attempt to get me to make a video on a meme that makes no sense

23:39.440 --> 23:43.120
and really doesn't exist, so I look like a fool and lose credibility.

23:44.880 --> 23:46.640
Hey, behind the meme,

23:46.640 --> 23:49.360
here's a little bit of information that you may have missed

23:49.360 --> 23:51.920
because you weren't able to read it off of Know Your Meme.

23:51.920 --> 23:58.400
The people of 4chan hate and make fun of everybody, especially normies like you.

23:58.400 --> 24:03.840
Did you seriously expect them to welcome your bastardization of memes with open arms?

24:03.840 --> 24:05.440
Are you really that dense?

24:05.520 --> 24:08.240
Yes, there are people who will dislike you on the internet.

24:08.240 --> 24:10.240
It's an inevitability.

24:10.240 --> 24:15.920
Being upset at 4chan for being mean to you is like being mad at a bear for shitting in the woods.

24:15.920 --> 24:18.800
And the worst part is that everyone in the comments are supporting him.

24:18.800 --> 24:21.440
Way to go behind the meme, you really showed them.

24:21.440 --> 24:24.640
Way to criticize a site that literally makes fun of itself.

24:24.640 --> 24:30.080
Is everybody just completely oblivious to how fundamentally flawed the message of this video is?

24:30.080 --> 24:33.920
He complains about 4chan being elitist when it comes to memes.

24:33.920 --> 24:37.840
You see, some people on the internet like to act like elitist when it comes to memes.

24:37.840 --> 24:38.960
Well, of course they are.

24:38.960 --> 24:42.800
4chan ain't good for much, but they churn out some fucking good memes.

25:04.320 --> 25:07.440
The people of 4chan live and breathe memetics.

25:07.440 --> 25:09.840
Look at the way they speak, the pictures they post.

25:09.840 --> 25:14.800
No other site on the internet is as adept at utilizing memetics as 4chan.

25:14.800 --> 25:17.200
So of course they're fucking elitist about memes,

25:17.200 --> 25:20.320
just like how Michael Jordan is elitist about basketball.

25:20.320 --> 25:23.280
When you're that good at something, you deserve to be arrogant.

25:23.280 --> 25:26.480
And then you're upset that they're complaining about you,

25:26.480 --> 25:28.320
someone who knows nothing about memes,

25:28.320 --> 25:33.200
exposing the memes that they created to an audience of normies whom they despise.

25:33.200 --> 25:35.520
And here we arrive at the main point of this video.

25:42.000 --> 25:45.680
The existence and continuation of Behind the Memes channel

25:45.680 --> 25:48.720
is dismantling and destroying the culture of memes,

25:48.720 --> 25:52.320
which has been delicately constructed over the course of two decades.

25:52.320 --> 25:55.200
He's acting like such a hero, such a saint.

25:55.200 --> 26:00.480
Oh, I'm educating those poor unfortunate normies who can't learn about memes for themselves,

26:00.480 --> 26:03.120
all so that they don't have to feel left out.

26:03.120 --> 26:06.880
Subscribe to Behind the Meme and never feel left out again.

26:06.880 --> 26:08.400
I'm the good guy here.

26:08.400 --> 26:10.640
Okay there chief, hold the fuck up for a second.

26:10.640 --> 26:14.640
You're not devoting your time and effort to teach impoverished schoolchildren in Africa.

26:14.640 --> 26:16.640
You're talking about memes on the internet.

26:16.640 --> 26:19.040
You're not exactly humanitarian of the year here.

26:19.040 --> 26:24.080
These poor unfortunate people you claim to be helping have access to the internet too,

26:24.080 --> 26:25.200
you do realize that.

26:25.200 --> 26:27.440
They can become an expert in any meme they want,

26:27.440 --> 26:31.120
but the truth is they're all lazy and they prefer to be spoon fed

26:31.120 --> 26:35.680
with unchallenging and generic content like the normies they are.

26:35.680 --> 26:39.600
And others shouldn't feel dumb when they see a new meme and don't exactly get the joke.

26:39.600 --> 26:40.080
Wrong.

26:40.080 --> 26:43.120
You see, back in the day, only the most ambitious meme seekers

26:43.120 --> 26:48.320
could actually take the patience and time to learn about memes and meme culture on their own.

26:48.320 --> 26:51.600
This system allowed the meme economy to be sustainable

26:51.600 --> 26:53.760
because the only people who had access to memes

26:53.760 --> 26:57.600
were those who were willing to actually go out and investigate them on their own.

26:57.600 --> 27:00.960
Memes were consumed more slowly and they lasted longer.

27:01.040 --> 27:02.480
Now, thanks to behind the meme,

27:02.480 --> 27:06.720
everyone can have a superficial understanding of memes and overuse them as much as they want.

27:06.720 --> 27:07.680
Isn't that great?

27:07.680 --> 27:08.800
Wait, it's not.

27:08.800 --> 27:10.560
Because when everyone knows about a meme,

27:10.560 --> 27:15.040
it becomes so deluded that no one wants to use the meme anymore and it dies.

27:15.040 --> 27:18.720
You're basically inviting all these normie children to piss in our meme pool.

27:18.720 --> 27:21.280
You force everyone else to jump to cleaner water

27:21.280 --> 27:24.640
while you make your area so insufferably full of piss

27:24.640 --> 27:27.920
that eventually no one, not even normies, want to swim in them.

27:27.920 --> 27:30.160
And this just keeps happening faster and faster.

27:30.160 --> 27:33.040
The meme economy isn't sustainable anymore.

27:33.040 --> 27:35.440
And soon, we're gonna run out of clean water.

27:35.440 --> 27:38.960
You have any idea how much faster memes die nowadays?

27:38.960 --> 27:42.800
For someone who claims to love memes so much, you really don't seem to care.

27:42.800 --> 27:46.480
As a matter of fact, you don't even seem to be aware of what you're doing.

27:46.480 --> 27:49.600
I like how you tell 4chan to look at the bigger picture.

27:49.600 --> 27:52.560
But if they would take a step back and look at the big picture of things,

27:52.560 --> 27:54.480
they would see that I'm just a teacher.

27:54.480 --> 27:57.120
As if you understand memes better than they do.

27:57.120 --> 28:00.640
But guys, I'm totally part of your community and I have been for years.

28:00.640 --> 28:04.160
The thing is, all those who hate on my channel should be happy it's me.

28:04.160 --> 28:07.200
I've been a part of your communities and forums for years.

28:07.200 --> 28:08.320
I am one of you.

28:09.200 --> 28:11.600
And this is the worst part of it all behind the meme

28:11.600 --> 28:14.720
because you claim to be just like us, the outsiders.

28:14.720 --> 28:16.160
But you're not like us.

28:16.160 --> 28:18.960
You are a normie.

28:19.520 --> 28:21.360
Just like your fan base.

28:21.360 --> 28:24.080
So stop lying to us and lying to yourself.

28:24.080 --> 28:26.000
Anthony Fantano is an outsider.

28:26.000 --> 28:28.560
The people of 4chan are outsiders.

28:28.560 --> 28:31.200
You, behind the meme, are a normie.

28:31.200 --> 28:34.720
And it doesn't matter how much you pretend to be such a meme expert.

28:34.720 --> 28:40.480
You make it apparent that you're a normie through your bland, unchallenging, and generic videos.

28:40.480 --> 28:44.560
You try to be like Anthony Fantano, but end up being like WatchMojo.

28:44.560 --> 28:46.960
Because you lack the creativity and wit

28:46.960 --> 28:52.720
to differentiate yourself from the most ordinary dime-a-dozen YouTube content clones.

28:52.720 --> 28:54.800
You are not distinct.

28:54.880 --> 29:00.000
Anyone could replace you and half of your fans wouldn't even notice or care.

29:00.000 --> 29:03.520
And if that wasn't enough, you want everyone to be just like you.

29:03.520 --> 29:09.040
And you simply cannot fathom a world where people disagree with your flawed concept of memes.

29:09.040 --> 29:12.800
So you seek to belittle, condescend, and patronize them.

29:12.800 --> 29:15.920
And even worse is that you use this fake persona

29:15.920 --> 29:20.400
to give yourself a scrap of legitimacy towards educating people about memes

29:20.400 --> 29:22.720
when you don't know anything about them.

29:22.720 --> 29:26.000
And you end up feeding them superficial and inaccurate information

29:26.000 --> 29:29.440
leading to even more people like you who think they know memes,

29:29.440 --> 29:32.240
but actually don't know jack shit.

29:32.240 --> 29:34.880
But hey, that's the internet for ya.

29:34.880 --> 29:39.440
And on the internet, ignorance is king.

29:39.440 --> 29:54.720
So I just want to take these last few minutes to tie up some loose ends.

29:54.720 --> 29:57.920
First of all, I want to say that I do not hate behind the meme.

29:57.920 --> 30:01.600
I just hate this idea that what he's doing is perfectly okay

30:01.600 --> 30:06.240
and that we have some sort of obligation to make sure that no Normie gets left behind.

30:06.240 --> 30:10.400
No, he has to understand that there are negative consequences to what he's doing.

30:10.400 --> 30:14.160
However, I do not view him as someone with malicious intent.

30:14.160 --> 30:18.000
Rather, I view him as someone who misunderstands his role in the meme-scape.

30:18.000 --> 30:21.840
I'm not opposed either to the idea of Normies learning about memes.

30:21.840 --> 30:23.680
I just think you have to be careful about it

30:23.680 --> 30:27.120
and actually do a good job of explaining the memes and their context.

30:27.120 --> 30:31.200
I think it's better to try to bring Normies up to our level rather than sinking to theirs.

30:31.200 --> 30:33.040
The Meme Review does a good job of this,

30:33.040 --> 30:36.400
and I would highly recommend people watch that instead of Behind the Meme.

30:36.400 --> 30:41.520
But the fact of the matter is that Behind the Meme has a wider appeal than the Meme Review ever could

30:41.520 --> 30:43.680
simply because of the nature of Normies.

30:43.680 --> 30:47.520
All I know is that you never see the Meme Review on the YouTube Trending tab.

30:47.520 --> 30:52.720
It's frustrating how YouTube is systematically favoring an inferior meme series.

30:52.720 --> 30:56.720
But it's what Normies want to see, and it's what gets views.

30:56.720 --> 31:00.720
And that's the bottom line on YouTube, so there's nothing we can really do about it.

31:00.720 --> 31:04.400
I understand that he's a Normie trying to dictate an outsider culture,

31:04.400 --> 31:09.680
but I also understand that the meme-scape is constantly evolving and it's impossible to fight it.

31:09.680 --> 31:13.600
Perhaps what is happening now is just part of the natural progression of memes,

31:13.600 --> 31:16.160
but we can't really tell for sure either way.

31:16.160 --> 31:20.160
Finally, I understand that this video is going to get me hated by a lot of people,

31:20.160 --> 31:22.080
and that's a consequence I'm willing to accept.

31:22.080 --> 31:26.320
My goal with this video is not to start YouTube drama nor expose a YouTuber.

31:26.320 --> 31:29.440
My goal with this video is to explain a perspective.

31:29.440 --> 31:33.440
A perspective which is unclear and overlooked by many people.

31:33.440 --> 31:36.800
I feel like there are a lot of misconceptions about memes out there,

31:36.800 --> 31:40.720
and I want to continue this series to make as much sense of it as I can.

31:40.720 --> 31:43.520
Because if there's one thing I learned while making this video,

31:43.520 --> 31:47.120
it's that people in general really don't know much about memes.

31:47.120 --> 31:51.760
The meme-scape today is incredibly deep and complex, and it changes every day.

31:51.760 --> 31:54.640
There are so many components that have yet to be explored,

31:54.640 --> 31:58.400
and I think all of us could try to understand it better, including me.

31:58.400 --> 32:01.520
But hey, that's why it's just a theory!

32:01.520 --> 32:03.280
A meme theory!

32:03.840 --> 32:06.000
Thanks for unsubscribing!
