Do you miss the old days of YouTube when animations, skits, and YouTube poops were all popular?
You know, the days before every YouTuber was forced to relentlessly fellate the almighty
YouTube algorithm in order to salvage the tiniest scrap of popularity in the rat race
to gain relevance?
Well you should check out some of AlienMyth64's videos where he basically combines all three
of those things.
Seriously, watch this guy.
Good content.
Funny content.
Original content.
Watch him.
Do you like watching animation reviews on YouTube but don't like stomach ulcers, high
blood pressure, and irritable bowel syndrome?
Then you should watch some reviews by The Real Jims.
He primarily reviews classic Simpsons episodes but also does Simpsons theories and is currently
reviewing all the Pixar films.
His videos have a concise and informative visual style and they're all really satisfying
watches.
He's been making good content for five years now and he still has less than 15,000 subscribers.
Probably because he doesn't scream at his audience with apoplectic rage about children's
cartoon shows.
So check out The Real Jims and actually, uh, not be pissed while watching animation reviews.
Are you a cynical sports fan whose sense of enjoyment has been brutally beaten down through
year after year of rooting for terrible franchises?
Well I invite you guys to check out the videos of Urinating Tree and share in the suffering
of your fellow lovable losers.
Urinating Tree chronicles and critiques some of the most pathetic franchises in all of
American sportsdom in brutally savage fashion befitting of the most saut√©ed and bitter
sports fan.
So sit back, relax, and take solace in knowing that there are at least a handful of sports
franchises as pathetic as yours.
This guy makes the most interesting and well put together videos I've ever seen in 10 years
of watching videos on this website.
So that's five good content creators that you probably haven't heard of.
I mean, go subscribe to them and support their content so that they can make more.
Have you seen any good channels that no one knows about?
Be sure to tell me in the comments below because I want to watch more good videos!
I have had it with these godawful videos!
I'm rich!
Rich!
Rich!
