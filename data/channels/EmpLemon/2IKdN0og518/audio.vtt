Do you miss the old days of YouTube when animations, skits, and YouTube poops were all popular?

00:52.080 --> 00:56.400
You know, the days before every YouTuber was forced to relentlessly fellate the almighty

00:56.400 --> 01:01.880
YouTube algorithm in order to salvage the tiniest scrap of popularity in the rat race

01:01.880 --> 01:03.360
to gain relevance?

01:03.360 --> 01:08.180
Well you should check out some of AlienMyth64's videos where he basically combines all three

01:08.180 --> 01:09.520
of those things.

01:09.520 --> 01:11.760
Seriously, watch this guy.

01:11.760 --> 01:13.480
Good content.

01:13.480 --> 01:14.960
Funny content.

01:14.960 --> 01:17.080
Original content.

01:17.080 --> 01:19.560
Watch him.

01:19.560 --> 01:23.780
Do you like watching animation reviews on YouTube but don't like stomach ulcers, high

01:23.780 --> 01:26.500
blood pressure, and irritable bowel syndrome?

01:26.500 --> 01:29.200
Then you should watch some reviews by The Real Jims.

01:29.200 --> 01:34.260
He primarily reviews classic Simpsons episodes but also does Simpsons theories and is currently

01:34.260 --> 01:36.160
reviewing all the Pixar films.

01:36.160 --> 01:40.820
His videos have a concise and informative visual style and they're all really satisfying

01:40.820 --> 01:41.820
watches.

01:41.820 --> 01:46.020
He's been making good content for five years now and he still has less than 15,000 subscribers.

01:46.020 --> 01:51.700
Probably because he doesn't scream at his audience with apoplectic rage about children's

01:51.700 --> 01:53.040
cartoon shows.

01:53.040 --> 02:01.440
So check out The Real Jims and actually, uh, not be pissed while watching animation reviews.

02:01.440 --> 02:05.940
Are you a cynical sports fan whose sense of enjoyment has been brutally beaten down through

02:05.940 --> 02:09.300
year after year of rooting for terrible franchises?

02:09.300 --> 02:14.000
Well I invite you guys to check out the videos of Urinating Tree and share in the suffering

02:14.000 --> 02:16.160
of your fellow lovable losers.

02:16.160 --> 02:20.320
Urinating Tree chronicles and critiques some of the most pathetic franchises in all of

02:20.320 --> 02:26.040
American sportsdom in brutally savage fashion befitting of the most sautÃ©ed and bitter

02:26.040 --> 02:27.500
sports fan.

02:27.500 --> 02:32.060
So sit back, relax, and take solace in knowing that there are at least a handful of sports

02:32.060 --> 02:36.420
franchises as pathetic as yours.

02:36.420 --> 02:41.140
