00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:52,080
Do you miss the old days of YouTube when animations, skits, and YouTube poops were all popular?

12
00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:56,400
You know, the days before every YouTuber was forced to relentlessly fellate the almighty

13
00:00:56,400 --> 00:01:01,880
YouTube algorithm in order to salvage the tiniest scrap of popularity in the rat race

14
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:03,360
to gain relevance?

15
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:08,180
Well you should check out some of AlienMyth64's videos where he basically combines all three

16
00:01:08,180 --> 00:01:09,520
of those things.

17
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:11,760
Seriously, watch this guy.

18
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:13,480
Good content.

19
00:01:13,480 --> 00:01:14,960
Funny content.

20
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:17,080
Original content.

21
00:01:17,080 --> 00:01:19,560
Watch him.

22
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:23,780
Do you like watching animation reviews on YouTube but don't like stomach ulcers, high

23
00:01:23,780 --> 00:01:26,500
blood pressure, and irritable bowel syndrome?

24
00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:29,200
Then you should watch some reviews by The Real Jims.

25
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:34,260
He primarily reviews classic Simpsons episodes but also does Simpsons theories and is currently

26
00:01:34,260 --> 00:01:36,160
reviewing all the Pixar films.

27
00:01:36,160 --> 00:01:40,820
His videos have a concise and informative visual style and they're all really satisfying

28
00:01:40,820 --> 00:01:41,820
watches.

29
00:01:41,820 --> 00:01:46,020
He's been making good content for five years now and he still has less than 15,000 subscribers.

30
00:01:46,020 --> 00:01:51,700
Probably because he doesn't scream at his audience with apoplectic rage about children's

31
00:01:51,700 --> 00:01:53,040
cartoon shows.

32
00:01:53,040 --> 00:02:01,440
So check out The Real Jims and actually, uh, not be pissed while watching animation reviews.

33
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:05,940
Are you a cynical sports fan whose sense of enjoyment has been brutally beaten down through

34
00:02:05,940 --> 00:02:09,300
year after year of rooting for terrible franchises?

35
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:14,000
Well I invite you guys to check out the videos of Urinating Tree and share in the suffering

36
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,160
of your fellow lovable losers.

37
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:20,320
Urinating Tree chronicles and critiques some of the most pathetic franchises in all of

38
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:26,040
American sportsdom in brutally savage fashion befitting of the most sautÃ©ed and bitter

39
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:27,500
sports fan.

40
00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:32,060
So sit back, relax, and take solace in knowing that there are at least a handful of sports

41
00:02:32,060 --> 00:02:36,420
franchises as pathetic as yours.

42
00:02:36,420 --> 00:02:41,140
This guy makes the most interesting and well put together videos I've ever seen in 10 years

43
00:02:41,140 --> 00:02:44,360
of watching videos on this website.
