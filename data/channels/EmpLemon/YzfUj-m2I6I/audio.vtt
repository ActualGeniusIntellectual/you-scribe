00:00.000 --> 00:08.940
The ancient Chinese believed in the philosophical concept of yin and yang, two opposing forces

00:08.940 --> 00:11.680
which complement and complete each other.

00:11.680 --> 00:15.980
Yin and yang are most often depicted with this symbol, the taijitu.

00:15.980 --> 00:20.380
Although the light and dark sides defy each other, each contains a piece of the other

00:20.380 --> 00:22.940
fundamentally embedded within.

00:22.940 --> 00:27.400
Together the opposing forces exist in a state of balanced equilibrium.

00:27.400 --> 00:32.280
Numerous examples of yin and yang exist in nature, such as the brightest light creating

00:32.280 --> 00:34.040
the harshest shadows.

00:34.040 --> 00:39.160
But perhaps the most fascinating application of yin and yang exists in the realm of fiction,

00:39.160 --> 00:45.420
in the relationship between heroes and villains.

00:45.420 --> 00:48.240
We all grow up listening to the same kind of story.

00:48.240 --> 00:52.480
A valiant hero overcomes the odds to defeat a despicable villain.

00:52.480 --> 00:56.340
We learn to view heroes and villains as part of a binary system.

00:56.340 --> 00:59.780
We root for the good guys and root against the bad guys.

00:59.780 --> 01:03.680
It's a principle that all but defines the essence of storytelling.

01:03.680 --> 01:09.300
As children we view this as an unbreakable law, but as we get older something very mysterious

01:09.300 --> 01:10.300
happens.

01:10.300 --> 01:13.740
The line between heroes and villains starts to blur.

01:13.740 --> 01:18.260
All of a sudden heroes start to look a lot more lame, while villains become all the more

01:18.260 --> 01:19.440
appealing.

01:19.440 --> 01:24.040
If you look at the word villain in the dictionary, nearly every definition you'll find will mention

01:24.040 --> 01:25.380
the word evil.

01:25.380 --> 01:27.540
But what exactly is evil?

01:27.540 --> 01:32.580
Well in most cultures the concept of good and evil are tied to our premise of morality.

01:32.580 --> 01:38.140
Our morality is often determined by whatever religious or spiritual code we grew up with.

01:38.140 --> 01:41.840
Religions across the globe embody evil through the image of the devil.

01:41.840 --> 01:47.140
As the face of evil for the world's most popular religion, Satan is likely the most infamous

01:47.140 --> 01:49.840
villain in human history.

01:49.840 --> 01:58.400
Most religions portray me as the incarnate of evil, meaning my actions literally define

01:58.400 --> 02:01.120
what it is to be immoral.

02:01.120 --> 02:03.240
It's tough to get more evil than that.

02:03.240 --> 02:06.480
In fact, it's impossible.

02:06.480 --> 02:10.800
Each version of the devil shares similar traits, but none are identical.

02:10.800 --> 02:14.800
There is no definitive answer for what constitutes an evil action.

02:14.800 --> 02:22.380
Right, I can see that I will have to teach you how to be villains.

02:22.380 --> 02:27.320
The notion of evil is an abstraction and can be altered depending on the society in place

02:27.320 --> 02:28.880
around us.

02:28.880 --> 02:33.760
Evil assumes the purpose of a blanket term attributed to people who cause us negative

02:33.760 --> 02:35.220
outcomes.

02:35.220 --> 02:39.520
Morality is one of the most difficult concepts for the human mind to understand.

02:39.520 --> 02:42.860
Everyone has their own set of complex needs and motivations.

02:42.860 --> 02:47.400
It's much easier to just look at the source of all your suffering and call it evil.

02:47.400 --> 02:52.860
It's much easier to write a story and have the antagonist do bad things because they're

02:52.860 --> 02:53.860
evil.

02:53.860 --> 02:57.500
Unfortunately, evil villains also tend to be forgettable villains.

02:57.500 --> 03:00.720
I mean, does anybody really remember Maleficent?

03:00.720 --> 03:03.520
Her name is a literal synonym for evil.

03:03.520 --> 03:07.900
The problem with evil characters is that we have a hard time relating to them.

03:07.900 --> 03:12.060
Contrary to what the media will tell you, the average person doesn't tend to enjoy doing

03:12.060 --> 03:13.660
malicious things.

03:13.660 --> 03:18.080
To create a truly memorable villain, you have to connect them with the audience in a meaningful

03:18.080 --> 03:19.080
way.

03:19.080 --> 03:23.520
One of the most common and effective methods of achieving this is to establish a transformation

03:23.520 --> 03:29.620
from friend to fiend.

03:29.620 --> 03:34.380
The most well-known example of this transformation is the character of Darth Vader.

03:34.380 --> 03:39.300
In A New Hope, Vader is more or less presented as a standard formidable bad guy without much

03:39.300 --> 03:40.820
character depth.

03:40.820 --> 03:45.160
We're told he was once good, but we don't actually get to see this dimension of Vader

03:45.160 --> 03:50.180
until the Empire Strikes Back, where for the first time we catch a glimpse of what he looks

03:50.180 --> 03:52.340
like beneath the mask.

03:52.340 --> 03:56.640
It's a shot that only lasts a few seconds, but it profoundly influences our perception

03:56.640 --> 03:58.280
of Vader's character.

03:58.280 --> 04:03.020
The film reveals that he was involved in some kind of horrific incident which left him permanently

04:03.020 --> 04:05.300
disfigured and scarred.

04:05.300 --> 04:09.900
Scars are a powerful visual and metaphorical tool to humanize a villain.

04:09.900 --> 04:15.560
They represent significant trauma and vulnerability, traits unlike anything we've seen in Vader

04:15.560 --> 04:17.500
before that point.

04:17.500 --> 04:34.540
One of the most iconic scars in fiction belongs to Prince Zuko from Avatar.

04:34.540 --> 04:38.780
The series begins with Zuko as the sole antagonist to the heroes.

04:38.780 --> 04:44.420
However, as the story goes on, it reveals the far more brutal framework around him.

04:44.420 --> 04:48.940
We eventually learn about his tragic origin and figure out that it was not nature, but

04:48.940 --> 04:52.380
nurture which made Zuko into the villain he is.

04:52.380 --> 04:57.060
He is driven not by an evil plan, but by the desire to redeem himself in the eyes of his

04:57.060 --> 04:58.860
father and his nation.

04:58.860 --> 05:04.780
Zuko is made relatable by being a very imperfect character, symbolized by his most striking

05:04.780 --> 05:06.820
physical feature.

05:06.820 --> 05:12.140
Despite his immense dedication and willpower, he leaves behind a legacy of failure.

05:12.140 --> 05:16.860
There's no doubt that Zuko suffers more than any other character in the series.

05:16.860 --> 05:21.300
After a while, you kind of forget he's the bad guy and just want to see him be happy.

05:21.300 --> 05:25.780
Ironically, Zuko's villainous path is only forged through his obsession with being a

05:25.780 --> 05:27.900
hero for the Fire Nation.

05:27.940 --> 05:33.340
At the end of the day, Zuko is only seeking what we all desire, belonging and acceptance

05:33.340 --> 05:34.940
from his peers.

05:34.940 --> 05:39.660
His scar is a physical token representing the insurmountable division between he and

05:39.660 --> 05:41.380
his ideal being.

05:41.380 --> 05:47.060
He sacrifices so much trying to overcome it, but the scar, like the past, can never be

05:47.060 --> 05:48.260
erased.

05:48.260 --> 05:52.980
It is only when Zuko learns to embrace his hardship that he truly becomes the person

05:52.980 --> 05:54.300
he was meant to be.

05:54.820 --> 05:59.580
I used to think this scar marked me, the mark of the Banished Prince, cursed to chase the

05:59.580 --> 06:06.300
Avatar forever, but lately, I've realized I'm free to determine my own destiny, even

06:06.300 --> 06:08.900
if I'll never be free of my mark.

06:08.900 --> 06:14.460
In the end, he fulfills his destiny as a hero, just not in the same way he envisioned.

06:14.460 --> 06:19.660
Zuko is a memorable villain because he is one of the most human villains ever written,

06:19.660 --> 06:22.540
but what about a villain that is the opposite of human?

06:24.700 --> 06:28.620
I don't know what the hell's in there, but it's weird and pissed off, whatever it is.

06:29.580 --> 06:35.100
Science fiction is no stranger to featuring antagonists of a more cosmological origin.

06:35.100 --> 06:40.980
This Halloween, I talked about John Carpenter's 1982 horror film The Thing, a story that features

06:40.980 --> 06:45.860
a shape-shifting alien which serves as an allegory for mistrust and paranoia.

06:45.860 --> 06:48.820
The monster from The Thing is akin to the works of H.P.

06:48.820 --> 06:51.620
Lovecraft and the premise of cosmic horror.

06:51.620 --> 06:56.420
The idea that human beings are insignificant compared to the unfathomable vastness of the

06:56.420 --> 06:57.740
universe.

06:57.740 --> 07:00.900
Lovecraftian monsters defy comprehension.

07:00.900 --> 07:04.940
They transcend our narrow purview of morality and evil.

07:04.940 --> 07:08.260
These antagonists frighten us on a more primal level.

07:08.260 --> 07:14.020
They represent a manifestation of mankind's most fundamental adversary, nature.

07:14.020 --> 07:18.500
There is no greater threat to human progress than the forces of nature, and no greater

07:18.500 --> 07:21.580
threat to nature than human progress.

07:21.580 --> 07:26.780
Thanks to our technological advancements, man sits atop the animal kingdom uncontested.

07:26.780 --> 07:31.100
Fictional monsters like The Thing remind us of a time when that wasn't the case.

07:31.100 --> 07:34.700
A time when we were not predators, but prey.

07:34.700 --> 07:39.740
No one on Earth can literally remember being hunted by a sabercat, but the impression lingers

07:39.740 --> 07:43.980
as an integral phobia baked into our evolutionary programming.

07:43.980 --> 07:48.580
Now that no other animal can challenge us, it's up to our imagination to create something

07:48.580 --> 07:49.740
that can.

07:49.740 --> 07:54.100
Perhaps our ultimate undoing won't come from nature, but from the very technology

07:54.100 --> 07:55.980
we use to conquer it.

07:55.980 --> 08:00.820
I know that you and Frank were planning to disconnect me, and I'm afraid that's something

08:00.820 --> 08:03.540
I cannot allow to happen.

08:03.540 --> 08:09.740
2001 was the first prominent film to feature artificial intelligence as a major antagonist.

08:09.740 --> 08:15.460
The premise of a rogue AI takes the relationship of man versus nature and inverts it.

08:15.460 --> 08:20.900
Just as human beings are a product of nature, machines are a product of humanity.

08:20.900 --> 08:26.780
Characters like HAL 9000 reverse our perspective of a creation overtaking its creator.

08:26.780 --> 08:31.520
Perhaps we, like nature before us, merely exist as the next stepping stone in the progression

08:31.520 --> 08:36.820
of intelligent life, and we, like nature, are doomed to be conquered by whatever comes

08:36.820 --> 08:37.820
next.

08:37.820 --> 08:42.580
At least for now the technological takeover remains in the realm of fiction, but rogue

08:42.580 --> 08:46.780
AI and other intelligent monsters do provide us with a unique conflict.

08:46.780 --> 08:50.260
They don't operate within trivial human desire.

08:50.260 --> 08:54.620
Godzilla won't stop destroying the city out of any moralistic epiphany.

08:54.620 --> 08:59.460
The most terrifying part of antagonists like these is not that we can't understand them,

08:59.460 --> 09:02.120
but that they can't understand us.

09:02.120 --> 09:07.020
To them, all of our petty rules and emotions are utterly meaningless.

09:07.020 --> 09:19.060
If the rule you followed brought you to this, of what use was the rule?

09:19.060 --> 09:23.980
Somewhere in the middle of Monster and Man you'll find a character like Anton Chigurh.

09:23.980 --> 09:29.940
In 2014 a team of Belgian psychiatrists analyzed more than 400 villains across cinema and found

09:29.940 --> 09:34.280
Chigurh the single most realistic representation of a psychopath.

09:34.280 --> 09:39.460
His total emotional disconnect to murder was similar to many real-life hitmen the researchers

09:39.460 --> 09:40.460
interviewed.

09:40.460 --> 09:43.620
Chigurh is a profoundly strange character.

09:43.620 --> 09:47.380
His origin, background and overall motives are all unknown.

09:47.380 --> 09:50.140
He is described as somewhat of a phantom.

09:50.140 --> 09:55.740
Many have analyzed the character as a rhetorical link between man and God, more specifically

09:55.740 --> 09:58.000
as an agent of fate.

09:58.000 --> 10:02.960
To Chigurh, human beings are no different than cattle waiting for slaughter, a perspective

10:02.960 --> 10:07.300
harshly illustrated through his means of execution.

10:07.300 --> 10:12.680
To him, human life is completely dispensable, but despite savagely murdering a dozen people

10:12.680 --> 10:17.680
in the film, it's difficult to describe Chigurh's motivation as malicious.

10:17.680 --> 10:21.500
Is it malicious when a tornado demolishes a Midwestern home?

10:21.500 --> 10:24.800
The film portrays Chigurh as an unstoppable force.

10:24.800 --> 10:29.340
It is stated that no one who sees him lives, but that's not entirely true.

10:29.340 --> 10:33.620
The most intriguing insights into Chigurh's character occur not when he kills, but when

10:33.620 --> 10:35.620
he chooses not to kill.

10:35.620 --> 10:39.780
Of course, if you asked him, he'd probably tell you that there was never really any choice

10:39.780 --> 10:40.780
in the matter.

10:40.780 --> 10:45.540
Chigurh's actions are dictated by a strict personal code of conduct that's never fully

10:45.540 --> 10:46.540
explained.

10:46.540 --> 10:49.500
All of his kills have a consistent logic to them.

10:49.500 --> 10:53.860
Most of the victims were simply dispatched as a cut-and-dry means of completing his primary

10:53.860 --> 10:54.900
objective.

10:54.900 --> 11:00.100
It's only through ambiguous situations when we capture a glimpse into Chigurh's philosophy.

11:00.100 --> 11:05.020
In the iconic gas station scene, he contemplates killing the clerk but offers him an out in

11:05.020 --> 11:06.820
the form of a coin toss.

11:06.820 --> 11:11.460
Pragmatically speaking, the coin toss is a meaningless gesture, but within Chigurh's

11:11.460 --> 11:15.780
internal principles, it allows him to act independently of a conscience.

11:15.780 --> 11:18.740
The nature of Chigurh's character is deterministic.

11:18.740 --> 11:23.780
By acting as the hand of fate, he relinquishes his own agency over situations.

11:23.780 --> 11:28.740
He operates automatically, never deviating from the most efficient path towards his eventual

11:28.740 --> 11:29.740
outcome.

11:29.740 --> 11:35.180
The idea of people feebly trying to exercise control over their destiny confuses and disgusts

11:35.180 --> 11:36.180
him.

11:36.180 --> 11:40.420
If mercy exists in Chigurh's universe, it can only be found in something as brutally

11:40.420 --> 11:42.420
random as a coin toss.

11:42.420 --> 11:47.540
It's been traveling 22 years to get here, and now it's here.

11:47.540 --> 11:49.740
And it's either heads or tails.

11:49.740 --> 11:54.580
It's for this reason why some people have defined Chigurh as the embodiment of chaos.

11:54.580 --> 11:59.060
The relative unpredictability of the character creates the striking tension for which the

11:59.060 --> 12:00.620
film is so celebrated.

12:00.620 --> 12:05.760
However, Chigurh is paradoxically the most calculated, meticulous, and orderly character

12:05.760 --> 12:07.080
in the story.

12:07.080 --> 12:11.500
If we all knew what he knew, all of his actions would make perfect sense.

12:11.500 --> 12:14.240
Such is the confounding nature of a psychopath.

12:14.240 --> 12:16.540
They exist in the uncanny valley.

12:16.540 --> 12:21.220
Although they resemble us on a physical level, we will never understand them on a mental

12:21.220 --> 12:22.220
level.

12:22.220 --> 12:26.900
They represent a different kind of human being, those who cultivate order out of chaos.

12:26.900 --> 12:32.460
Do you have any idea how crazy you are?

12:32.460 --> 12:37.400
Madness is a truly terrifying concept, one that is ultimately governed by the same principles

12:37.400 --> 12:39.300
of a coin toss.

12:39.300 --> 12:42.740
The coin don't have no say.

12:42.740 --> 12:43.740
It's just you.

12:43.740 --> 12:48.780
I got here the same way the coin did.

12:48.780 --> 12:53.300
At the end of the day, it's not our futile attempts at bravery, reasoning, or law enforcement

12:53.300 --> 12:54.980
which stop Chigurh.

12:54.980 --> 13:02.640
His justice can only be served by fate itself.

13:02.640 --> 13:10.420
Sometimes it's more than just fate which stands in the way of our ultimate goal.

13:10.420 --> 13:20.180
There are no two words in the English language more harmful than good job.

13:20.180 --> 13:24.780
In the pursuit of perfection, we may find ourselves in the essential conflict of student

13:24.780 --> 13:26.380
versus master.

13:26.380 --> 13:31.120
This conflict is intimately explored in the 2014 film Whiplash.

13:31.120 --> 13:34.540
Terence Fletcher is the consummate stalwart of success.

13:34.540 --> 13:39.160
Andrew Neiman is chasing success, but his desire to impress Fletcher transforms his

13:39.160 --> 13:41.200
passion into an obsession.

13:41.200 --> 13:45.800
Neiman is forced to endure a torturous gauntlet of emotional and physical trauma that have

13:45.800 --> 13:49.940
inspired many to label Fletcher as one of cinema's cruelest villains.

13:49.940 --> 13:54.420
He is an unrelenting critic, honing in on imperfections that are indistinguishable to

13:54.420 --> 13:55.920
the average listener.

13:55.920 --> 14:00.440
He demolishes his students' confidence by setting the bar of excellence insurmountably

14:00.440 --> 14:01.440
high.

14:01.440 --> 14:06.200
Fletcher's methods are borderline sadistic, however, the more abuse he hurls at Neiman,

14:06.200 --> 14:08.820
the more Neiman refuses to concede.

14:08.820 --> 14:13.820
Despite their bitter adversarial relationship, both characters are ultimately working towards

14:13.820 --> 14:18.760
the same goal, overcoming the gap between proficiency and mastery.

14:18.760 --> 14:21.420
What separates greatness from mediocrity?

14:21.420 --> 14:25.260
Perhaps it is practice, dedication, raw talent or dumb luck.

14:25.260 --> 14:30.340
Well, according to the film, greatness is embedded deep within us and it's up to antagonists

14:30.340 --> 14:33.140
like Fletcher to extract our potential.

14:33.140 --> 14:38.020
Throughout the film, Neiman is not just battling Fletcher, he is also battling himself.

14:38.220 --> 14:44.140
Fletcher's character is largely a manifestation of our ability to improve as an individual.

14:44.140 --> 14:48.600
Even though Neiman wants more than anything to overcome Fletcher, he can't help but find

14:48.600 --> 14:51.660
himself forming a mutual respect for the man.

14:51.660 --> 14:57.240
As Fletcher hammers him with ruthless perfectionism, Neiman finds himself becoming more ruthless

14:57.240 --> 15:00.000
as he closes in on perfection.

15:00.000 --> 15:04.980
In the end, he gives up everything, his friends, family, romance, health and dignity all to

15:04.980 --> 15:07.260
chase the mastery of his craft.

15:07.500 --> 15:12.260
Fletcher broke Neiman down into nothing and then resurrected him in his own image.

15:12.260 --> 15:17.440
Most of us remember Fletcher as a cruel master who demanded excellence no matter the cost,

15:17.440 --> 15:20.980
an archetype not uncommon to many competitive professions.

15:20.980 --> 15:25.860
However, the character should also be renowned as a prime example of a villain converging

15:25.860 --> 15:27.220
with the hero.

15:27.220 --> 15:31.140
To truly defeat Fletcher, Neiman had to become Fletcher.

15:31.140 --> 15:36.020
See, now you respect me, because I'm a threat.

15:37.260 --> 15:45.040
But what about a case where instead of transforming into the villain, the hero creates the villain?

15:45.040 --> 15:48.740
To find this, you have to look no further than the relationship between Syndrome and

15:48.740 --> 15:50.160
Mr. Incredible.

15:50.160 --> 15:54.500
The story of a hero's biggest fan turning into his biggest nemesis.

15:54.500 --> 15:59.820
Unlike the case in Whiplash, Syndrome's obsessive turn is spawned out of neglect from his former

15:59.820 --> 16:00.820
idol.

16:00.820 --> 16:05.260
The Incredibles is a film which dissects the anatomy of heroes and villains.

16:05.260 --> 16:09.300
When you boil it down, how do we really define a heroic action?

16:09.300 --> 16:13.820
In his analysis of the film, YouTube reviewer The Real Jims made the intriguing point that

16:13.820 --> 16:19.380
in other Pixar films, Buddy would be the protagonist, the scrappy underdog who gets told by the

16:19.380 --> 16:22.020
world around him that he's not good enough.

16:22.020 --> 16:26.260
Where the character deviates from the archetype is in his misplaced priorities and what it

16:26.260 --> 16:28.440
means to be a hero.

16:28.440 --> 16:33.220
The Incredibles subverts the ethos of the prototypical Pixar formula by examining how

16:33.220 --> 16:38.300
the underdog's story could actually corrupt someone who takes it too much to heart.

16:38.300 --> 16:43.260
Syndrome gets more caught up in the fanfare of heroics than the true moral significance.

16:43.260 --> 16:48.300
His name may very well be a reference to hero syndrome, the term used to describe the phenomenon

16:48.300 --> 16:51.840
of firefighters intentionally committing acts of arson.

16:51.840 --> 16:56.640
Since the release of the film, this circumstance has become even more apropos through the rise

16:56.640 --> 16:58.100
of social media.

16:58.100 --> 17:04.020
We now live in a world where anybody can receive public adoration for sanctimonious theatrics.

17:04.020 --> 17:07.920
And when everyone's super, no one will be.

17:07.920 --> 17:12.380
Just like the case with Syndrome fighting the Omnidroid, many of our most widely worshipped

17:12.380 --> 17:15.220
heroes may be entirely contrived.

17:15.220 --> 17:19.620
The Incredibles suggest that we choose our heroes carefully because the most sinister

17:19.620 --> 17:22.600
villains may be hiding in plain sight.

17:22.600 --> 17:27.540
Sometimes the people we end up hating the most are the ones we fool ourselves into loving.

17:27.540 --> 17:31.860
In spite of everything you've done for them, eventually they will hate you.

17:31.860 --> 17:37.280
You either die a hero, or you live long enough to see yourself become the villain.

17:37.280 --> 17:43.100
We tend to use the terms villain and antagonist interchangeably, but are they really the same thing?

17:43.100 --> 17:47.500
In a literary sense, the antagonist is simply the character who impedes the goals of the

17:47.500 --> 17:52.460
protagonist, and the protagonist is simply the main character of the story.

17:52.500 --> 17:57.700
Contrary to popular belief, villains and protagonists are not mutually exclusive.

17:57.700 --> 18:02.380
On rare occasions you will see a villain so renowned that they require their own story.

18:02.380 --> 18:05.660
So what happens when a villain becomes the protagonist?

18:05.660 --> 18:08.780
Well, you end up with a character like the Joker.

18:08.780 --> 18:10.780
Hi.

18:14.340 --> 18:19.280
The Joker is quite possibly the most iconic villain in all of popular culture.

18:19.280 --> 18:24.400
As the nemesis to Batman, one of the most recognizable superheroes, the Joker exploded

18:24.400 --> 18:29.680
in popularity after his legendary portrayal in the 2008 film The Dark Knight.

18:29.680 --> 18:34.240
The untimely death of Heath Ledger infused an air of mysticism to the performance and

18:34.240 --> 18:35.520
the character.

18:35.520 --> 18:39.680
The Dark Knight Joker has been described by many as one of the most likable villains of

18:39.680 --> 18:40.880
all time.

18:40.880 --> 18:46.800
He is the consummate bad guy, a glorious amalgamation of all the villains I listed so far.

18:46.800 --> 18:49.280
He is tragically scarred like Zuko.

18:49.280 --> 18:53.200
His motives transcend our comprehension like HAL 9000.

18:53.200 --> 18:56.040
He is a measured psychopath like Chigurh.

18:56.040 --> 19:01.120
Much like Fletcher, his actions corrupt and transform a hero into his own image.

19:01.120 --> 19:06.160
And much like Syndrome, he was created out of a disillusionment with his former idol.

19:06.160 --> 19:10.000
Eleven years after The Dark Knight, we got to see the Joker star in his own standalone

19:10.000 --> 19:14.160
movie, but in the months leading up to the film's release, something very odd started

19:14.160 --> 19:15.160
happening.

19:15.160 --> 19:19.760
The mainstream media began pumping out article after article fearing that the new Joker movie

19:19.760 --> 19:22.480
would inspire acts of violence.

19:22.480 --> 19:26.520
Director Todd Phillips and lead actor Joaquin Phoenix were repeatedly grilled over their

19:26.520 --> 19:30.760
role in creating such an irresponsible glorification of murder.

19:30.760 --> 19:36.800
This was a film that came out the same year as John Wick 3, a 143 minute montage of Keanu

19:36.800 --> 19:42.600
Reeves gallantly executing more than 160 people, and a film that received no such concerns

19:42.600 --> 19:44.720
over violence from the media.

19:44.720 --> 19:47.280
So why was Joker so heavily scrutinized?

19:47.280 --> 19:51.960
Well, by the time it premiered, it became immediately obvious why out of touch media

19:51.960 --> 19:55.120
elites weren't exactly thrilled with the film.

19:55.120 --> 19:59.920
In an outcome that was precisely in line with the themes of the movie, Joker was scorned

19:59.920 --> 20:03.120
by the establishment and beloved by the masses.

20:03.120 --> 20:08.800
It's a film that highlights the most salient conflict of our time, man versus society.

20:08.800 --> 20:12.160
It's a film that, for many of us, speaks straight from the heart.

20:12.400 --> 20:16.400
If it was me dying on the sidewalk, you'd walk right over me.

20:16.400 --> 20:20.520
Some like to say that Joaquin Phoenix wasn't acting when he delivered this line.

20:20.520 --> 20:24.260
It's a reference to the real-life passing of his brother, River, who died of a drug

20:24.260 --> 20:28.360
overdose on the sidewalk in front of a Hollywood nightclub.

20:28.360 --> 20:30.760
Society is a cruel and unforgiving place.

20:30.760 --> 20:34.720
It spits out mentally ill loners like the Joker every single day.

20:34.720 --> 20:40.040
The media who chastised this movie for glorifying violence do the very same thing every time

20:40.040 --> 20:42.200
one of these people snaps.

20:42.200 --> 20:48.060
We all like to fetishize the outcomes of these massacres while completely ignoring the journey.

20:48.060 --> 20:49.880
Joker shows us that journey.

20:49.880 --> 20:54.560
It puts us inside the mind of the madman and suggests that all of us are accomplices to

20:54.560 --> 20:55.880
the bloodshed.

20:55.880 --> 21:00.400
John Wick could slaughter a million grunts in his wacky assassin world, but nothing he

21:00.400 --> 21:05.080
does will ever have the same impact as the Joker firing a single bullet through the skull

21:05.080 --> 21:06.800
of Murray Franklin.

21:06.800 --> 21:11.840
The Joker terrifies us not because he kills people, but because he makes us enjoy watching

21:11.840 --> 21:13.400
him kill people.

21:13.400 --> 21:19.320
No other piece of media in recent memory has made more people question their idea of morality.

21:19.320 --> 21:21.740
There's a little piece of the Joker in all of us.

21:21.740 --> 21:25.760
It's why many find the character so sympathetic and relatable.

21:25.760 --> 21:28.900
Was the Joker justified in killing Murray?

21:28.900 --> 21:32.820
Everything we've been taught in our entire lives would tell us no, but many of us would

21:32.820 --> 21:37.100
be lying if we said that scene wasn't at least a little bit cathartic.

21:37.100 --> 21:42.180
Of course, the movie never inspired any real-life violence, but it did make a tremendous impact

21:42.180 --> 21:43.780
on popular culture.

21:43.780 --> 21:48.580
For many, it perfectly captured the zeitgeist of growing discontent in an increasingly chaotic

21:48.580 --> 21:49.580
world.

21:49.580 --> 21:54.320
The spirit of the film has only grown in a year that featured mass political unrest and

21:54.320 --> 21:57.420
building frustration with social institutions.

21:57.420 --> 22:02.700
The Joker is one of the most memorable villains because he is so frighteningly close to reality,

22:02.700 --> 22:06.820
and the newest installment of the character only added to the legacy of fiction's most

22:06.820 --> 22:08.180
popular villain.

22:08.180 --> 22:12.500
Joker is profoundly uncomfortable and eternally controversial.

22:12.500 --> 22:16.400
It forces us to confront the ugliest parts of the human condition.

22:16.400 --> 22:19.740
At the end of the day, isn't that the ultimate point of a villain?

22:19.740 --> 22:25.300
I don't want to kill you.

22:25.300 --> 22:27.300
What would I do without you?

22:27.300 --> 22:28.300
No.

22:28.300 --> 22:29.860
No, you.

22:29.860 --> 22:33.220
You complete me.

22:33.220 --> 22:36.980
Fiction helps us mentally process conflict in the real world.

22:36.980 --> 22:40.940
When growing up, we're taught about good and evil as a way to avoid discussing the true

22:40.940 --> 22:43.380
complexities of actual issues.

22:43.380 --> 22:47.500
By the time we get older, we begin to realize that the world is not as black and white as

22:47.500 --> 22:49.340
we were led to believe.

22:49.340 --> 22:52.900
As much as we hate them, villains are a necessary evil.

22:52.900 --> 22:55.140
They push us to our absolute limit.

22:55.140 --> 22:58.580
They motivate us to aspire for something greater.

22:58.580 --> 23:02.820
Without any villains to defeat, the role of a hero is meaningless.

23:02.820 --> 23:07.580
Everyone is the protagonist of their own story, and we are free to choose our antagonists

23:07.580 --> 23:11.040
based on our own beliefs and attitudes towards the world.

23:11.040 --> 23:16.000
From a certain point of view, anybody can be either reveled or reviled.

23:16.000 --> 23:20.680
So be careful who you call the bad guy, because one day you might just end up feeling sympathy

23:20.680 --> 23:22.580
for the villain.

23:23.580 --> 23:33.860
But also aboard the ship is Commander Nefarious, Captain Imabadguy, and Admiral Bone to pick.

23:33.860 --> 23:34.860
But they don't mention them.
