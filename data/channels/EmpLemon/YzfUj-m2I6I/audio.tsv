0	8940	The ancient Chinese believed in the philosophical concept of yin and yang, two opposing forces
8940	11680	which complement and complete each other.
11680	15980	Yin and yang are most often depicted with this symbol, the taijitu.
15980	20380	Although the light and dark sides defy each other, each contains a piece of the other
20380	22940	fundamentally embedded within.
22940	27400	Together the opposing forces exist in a state of balanced equilibrium.
27400	32280	Numerous examples of yin and yang exist in nature, such as the brightest light creating
32280	34040	the harshest shadows.
34040	39160	But perhaps the most fascinating application of yin and yang exists in the realm of fiction,
39160	45420	in the relationship between heroes and villains.
45420	48240	We all grow up listening to the same kind of story.
48240	52480	A valiant hero overcomes the odds to defeat a despicable villain.
52480	56340	We learn to view heroes and villains as part of a binary system.
56340	59780	We root for the good guys and root against the bad guys.
59780	63680	It's a principle that all but defines the essence of storytelling.
63680	69300	As children we view this as an unbreakable law, but as we get older something very mysterious
69300	70300	happens.
70300	73740	The line between heroes and villains starts to blur.
73740	78260	All of a sudden heroes start to look a lot more lame, while villains become all the more
78260	79440	appealing.
79440	84040	If you look at the word villain in the dictionary, nearly every definition you'll find will mention
84040	85380	the word evil.
85380	87540	But what exactly is evil?
87540	92580	Well in most cultures the concept of good and evil are tied to our premise of morality.
92580	98140	Our morality is often determined by whatever religious or spiritual code we grew up with.
98140	101840	Religions across the globe embody evil through the image of the devil.
101840	107140	As the face of evil for the world's most popular religion, Satan is likely the most infamous
107140	109840	villain in human history.
109840	118400	Most religions portray me as the incarnate of evil, meaning my actions literally define
118400	121120	what it is to be immoral.
121120	123240	It's tough to get more evil than that.
123240	126480	In fact, it's impossible.
126480	130800	Each version of the devil shares similar traits, but none are identical.
130800	134800	There is no definitive answer for what constitutes an evil action.
134800	142380	Right, I can see that I will have to teach you how to be villains.
142380	147320	The notion of evil is an abstraction and can be altered depending on the society in place
147320	148880	around us.
148880	153760	Evil assumes the purpose of a blanket term attributed to people who cause us negative
153760	155220	outcomes.
155220	159520	Morality is one of the most difficult concepts for the human mind to understand.
159520	162860	Everyone has their own set of complex needs and motivations.
162860	167400	It's much easier to just look at the source of all your suffering and call it evil.
167400	172860	It's much easier to write a story and have the antagonist do bad things because they're
172860	173860	evil.
173860	177500	Unfortunately, evil villains also tend to be forgettable villains.
177500	180720	I mean, does anybody really remember Maleficent?
180720	183520	Her name is a literal synonym for evil.
183520	187900	The problem with evil characters is that we have a hard time relating to them.
187900	192060	Contrary to what the media will tell you, the average person doesn't tend to enjoy doing
192060	193660	malicious things.
193660	198080	To create a truly memorable villain, you have to connect them with the audience in a meaningful
198080	199080	way.
199080	203520	One of the most common and effective methods of achieving this is to establish a transformation
203520	209620	from friend to fiend.
209620	214380	The most well-known example of this transformation is the character of Darth Vader.
214380	219300	In A New Hope, Vader is more or less presented as a standard formidable bad guy without much
219300	220820	character depth.
220820	225160	We're told he was once good, but we don't actually get to see this dimension of Vader
225160	230180	until the Empire Strikes Back, where for the first time we catch a glimpse of what he looks
230180	232340	like beneath the mask.
232340	236640	It's a shot that only lasts a few seconds, but it profoundly influences our perception
236640	238280	of Vader's character.
238280	243020	The film reveals that he was involved in some kind of horrific incident which left him permanently
243020	245300	disfigured and scarred.
245300	249900	Scars are a powerful visual and metaphorical tool to humanize a villain.
249900	255560	They represent significant trauma and vulnerability, traits unlike anything we've seen in Vader
255560	257500	before that point.
257500	274540	One of the most iconic scars in fiction belongs to Prince Zuko from Avatar.
274540	278780	The series begins with Zuko as the sole antagonist to the heroes.
278780	284420	However, as the story goes on, it reveals the far more brutal framework around him.
284420	288940	We eventually learn about his tragic origin and figure out that it was not nature, but
288940	292380	nurture which made Zuko into the villain he is.
292380	297060	He is driven not by an evil plan, but by the desire to redeem himself in the eyes of his
297060	298860	father and his nation.
298860	304780	Zuko is made relatable by being a very imperfect character, symbolized by his most striking
304780	306820	physical feature.
306820	312140	Despite his immense dedication and willpower, he leaves behind a legacy of failure.
312140	316860	There's no doubt that Zuko suffers more than any other character in the series.
316860	321300	After a while, you kind of forget he's the bad guy and just want to see him be happy.
321300	325780	Ironically, Zuko's villainous path is only forged through his obsession with being a
325780	327900	hero for the Fire Nation.
327940	333340	At the end of the day, Zuko is only seeking what we all desire, belonging and acceptance
333340	334940	from his peers.
334940	339660	His scar is a physical token representing the insurmountable division between he and
339660	341380	his ideal being.
341380	347060	He sacrifices so much trying to overcome it, but the scar, like the past, can never be
347060	348260	erased.
348260	352980	It is only when Zuko learns to embrace his hardship that he truly becomes the person
352980	354300	he was meant to be.
354820	359580	I used to think this scar marked me, the mark of the Banished Prince, cursed to chase the
359580	366300	Avatar forever, but lately, I've realized I'm free to determine my own destiny, even
366300	368900	if I'll never be free of my mark.
368900	374460	In the end, he fulfills his destiny as a hero, just not in the same way he envisioned.
374460	379660	Zuko is a memorable villain because he is one of the most human villains ever written,
379660	382540	but what about a villain that is the opposite of human?
384700	388620	I don't know what the hell's in there, but it's weird and pissed off, whatever it is.
389580	395100	Science fiction is no stranger to featuring antagonists of a more cosmological origin.
395100	400980	This Halloween, I talked about John Carpenter's 1982 horror film The Thing, a story that features
400980	405860	a shape-shifting alien which serves as an allegory for mistrust and paranoia.
405860	408820	The monster from The Thing is akin to the works of H.P.
408820	411620	Lovecraft and the premise of cosmic horror.
411620	416420	The idea that human beings are insignificant compared to the unfathomable vastness of the
416420	417740	universe.
417740	420900	Lovecraftian monsters defy comprehension.
420900	424940	They transcend our narrow purview of morality and evil.
424940	428260	These antagonists frighten us on a more primal level.
428260	434020	They represent a manifestation of mankind's most fundamental adversary, nature.
434020	438500	There is no greater threat to human progress than the forces of nature, and no greater
438500	441580	threat to nature than human progress.
441580	446780	Thanks to our technological advancements, man sits atop the animal kingdom uncontested.
446780	451100	Fictional monsters like The Thing remind us of a time when that wasn't the case.
451100	454700	A time when we were not predators, but prey.
454700	459740	No one on Earth can literally remember being hunted by a sabercat, but the impression lingers
459740	463980	as an integral phobia baked into our evolutionary programming.
463980	468580	Now that no other animal can challenge us, it's up to our imagination to create something
468580	469740	that can.
469740	474100	Perhaps our ultimate undoing won't come from nature, but from the very technology
474100	475980	we use to conquer it.
475980	480820	I know that you and Frank were planning to disconnect me, and I'm afraid that's something
480820	483540	I cannot allow to happen.
483540	489740	2001 was the first prominent film to feature artificial intelligence as a major antagonist.
489740	495460	The premise of a rogue AI takes the relationship of man versus nature and inverts it.
495460	500900	Just as human beings are a product of nature, machines are a product of humanity.
500900	506780	Characters like HAL 9000 reverse our perspective of a creation overtaking its creator.
506780	511520	Perhaps we, like nature before us, merely exist as the next stepping stone in the progression
511520	516820	of intelligent life, and we, like nature, are doomed to be conquered by whatever comes
516820	517820	next.
517820	522580	At least for now the technological takeover remains in the realm of fiction, but rogue
522580	526780	AI and other intelligent monsters do provide us with a unique conflict.
526780	530260	They don't operate within trivial human desire.
530260	534620	Godzilla won't stop destroying the city out of any moralistic epiphany.
534620	539460	The most terrifying part of antagonists like these is not that we can't understand them,
539460	542120	but that they can't understand us.
542120	547020	To them, all of our petty rules and emotions are utterly meaningless.
547020	559060	If the rule you followed brought you to this, of what use was the rule?
559060	563980	Somewhere in the middle of Monster and Man you'll find a character like Anton Chigurh.
563980	569940	In 2014 a team of Belgian psychiatrists analyzed more than 400 villains across cinema and found
569940	574280	Chigurh the single most realistic representation of a psychopath.
574280	579460	His total emotional disconnect to murder was similar to many real-life hitmen the researchers
579460	580460	interviewed.
580460	583620	Chigurh is a profoundly strange character.
583620	587380	His origin, background and overall motives are all unknown.
587380	590140	He is described as somewhat of a phantom.
590140	595740	Many have analyzed the character as a rhetorical link between man and God, more specifically
595740	598000	as an agent of fate.
598000	602960	To Chigurh, human beings are no different than cattle waiting for slaughter, a perspective
602960	607300	harshly illustrated through his means of execution.
607300	612680	To him, human life is completely dispensable, but despite savagely murdering a dozen people
612680	617680	in the film, it's difficult to describe Chigurh's motivation as malicious.
617680	621500	Is it malicious when a tornado demolishes a Midwestern home?
621500	624800	The film portrays Chigurh as an unstoppable force.
624800	629340	It is stated that no one who sees him lives, but that's not entirely true.
629340	633620	The most intriguing insights into Chigurh's character occur not when he kills, but when
633620	635620	he chooses not to kill.
635620	639780	Of course, if you asked him, he'd probably tell you that there was never really any choice
639780	640780	in the matter.
640780	645540	Chigurh's actions are dictated by a strict personal code of conduct that's never fully
645540	646540	explained.
646540	649500	All of his kills have a consistent logic to them.
649500	653860	Most of the victims were simply dispatched as a cut-and-dry means of completing his primary
653860	654900	objective.
654900	660100	It's only through ambiguous situations when we capture a glimpse into Chigurh's philosophy.
660100	665020	In the iconic gas station scene, he contemplates killing the clerk but offers him an out in
665020	666820	the form of a coin toss.
666820	671460	Pragmatically speaking, the coin toss is a meaningless gesture, but within Chigurh's
671460	675780	internal principles, it allows him to act independently of a conscience.
675780	678740	The nature of Chigurh's character is deterministic.
678740	683780	By acting as the hand of fate, he relinquishes his own agency over situations.
683780	688740	He operates automatically, never deviating from the most efficient path towards his eventual
688740	689740	outcome.
689740	695180	The idea of people feebly trying to exercise control over their destiny confuses and disgusts
695180	696180	him.
696180	700420	If mercy exists in Chigurh's universe, it can only be found in something as brutally
700420	702420	random as a coin toss.
702420	707540	It's been traveling 22 years to get here, and now it's here.
707540	709740	And it's either heads or tails.
709740	714580	It's for this reason why some people have defined Chigurh as the embodiment of chaos.
714580	719060	The relative unpredictability of the character creates the striking tension for which the
719060	720620	film is so celebrated.
720620	725760	However, Chigurh is paradoxically the most calculated, meticulous, and orderly character
725760	727080	in the story.
727080	731500	If we all knew what he knew, all of his actions would make perfect sense.
731500	734240	Such is the confounding nature of a psychopath.
734240	736540	They exist in the uncanny valley.
736540	741220	Although they resemble us on a physical level, we will never understand them on a mental
741220	742220	level.
742220	746900	They represent a different kind of human being, those who cultivate order out of chaos.
746900	752460	Do you have any idea how crazy you are?
752460	757400	Madness is a truly terrifying concept, one that is ultimately governed by the same principles
757400	759300	of a coin toss.
759300	762740	The coin don't have no say.
762740	763740	It's just you.
763740	768780	I got here the same way the coin did.
768780	773300	At the end of the day, it's not our futile attempts at bravery, reasoning, or law enforcement
773300	774980	which stop Chigurh.
774980	782640	His justice can only be served by fate itself.
782640	790420	Sometimes it's more than just fate which stands in the way of our ultimate goal.
790420	800180	There are no two words in the English language more harmful than good job.
800180	804780	In the pursuit of perfection, we may find ourselves in the essential conflict of student
804780	806380	versus master.
806380	811120	This conflict is intimately explored in the 2014 film Whiplash.
811120	814540	Terence Fletcher is the consummate stalwart of success.
814540	819160	Andrew Neiman is chasing success, but his desire to impress Fletcher transforms his
819160	821200	passion into an obsession.
821200	825800	Neiman is forced to endure a torturous gauntlet of emotional and physical trauma that have
825800	829940	inspired many to label Fletcher as one of cinema's cruelest villains.
829940	834420	He is an unrelenting critic, honing in on imperfections that are indistinguishable to
834420	835920	the average listener.
835920	840440	He demolishes his students' confidence by setting the bar of excellence insurmountably
840440	841440	high.
841440	846200	Fletcher's methods are borderline sadistic, however, the more abuse he hurls at Neiman,
846200	848820	the more Neiman refuses to concede.
848820	853820	Despite their bitter adversarial relationship, both characters are ultimately working towards
853820	858760	the same goal, overcoming the gap between proficiency and mastery.
858760	861420	What separates greatness from mediocrity?
861420	865260	Perhaps it is practice, dedication, raw talent or dumb luck.
865260	870340	Well, according to the film, greatness is embedded deep within us and it's up to antagonists
870340	873140	like Fletcher to extract our potential.
873140	878020	Throughout the film, Neiman is not just battling Fletcher, he is also battling himself.
878220	884140	Fletcher's character is largely a manifestation of our ability to improve as an individual.
884140	888600	Even though Neiman wants more than anything to overcome Fletcher, he can't help but find
888600	891660	himself forming a mutual respect for the man.
891660	897240	As Fletcher hammers him with ruthless perfectionism, Neiman finds himself becoming more ruthless
897240	900000	as he closes in on perfection.
900000	904980	In the end, he gives up everything, his friends, family, romance, health and dignity all to
904980	907260	chase the mastery of his craft.
907500	912260	Fletcher broke Neiman down into nothing and then resurrected him in his own image.
912260	917440	Most of us remember Fletcher as a cruel master who demanded excellence no matter the cost,
917440	920980	an archetype not uncommon to many competitive professions.
920980	925860	However, the character should also be renowned as a prime example of a villain converging
925860	927220	with the hero.
927220	931140	To truly defeat Fletcher, Neiman had to become Fletcher.
931140	936020	See, now you respect me, because I'm a threat.
937260	945040	But what about a case where instead of transforming into the villain, the hero creates the villain?
945040	948740	To find this, you have to look no further than the relationship between Syndrome and
948740	950160	Mr. Incredible.
950160	954500	The story of a hero's biggest fan turning into his biggest nemesis.
954500	959820	Unlike the case in Whiplash, Syndrome's obsessive turn is spawned out of neglect from his former
959820	960820	idol.
960820	965260	The Incredibles is a film which dissects the anatomy of heroes and villains.
965260	969300	When you boil it down, how do we really define a heroic action?
969300	973820	In his analysis of the film, YouTube reviewer The Real Jims made the intriguing point that
973820	979380	in other Pixar films, Buddy would be the protagonist, the scrappy underdog who gets told by the
979380	982020	world around him that he's not good enough.
982020	986260	Where the character deviates from the archetype is in his misplaced priorities and what it
986260	988440	means to be a hero.
988440	993220	The Incredibles subverts the ethos of the prototypical Pixar formula by examining how
993220	998300	the underdog's story could actually corrupt someone who takes it too much to heart.
998300	1003260	Syndrome gets more caught up in the fanfare of heroics than the true moral significance.
1003260	1008300	His name may very well be a reference to hero syndrome, the term used to describe the phenomenon
1008300	1011840	of firefighters intentionally committing acts of arson.
1011840	1016640	Since the release of the film, this circumstance has become even more apropos through the rise
1016640	1018100	of social media.
1018100	1024020	We now live in a world where anybody can receive public adoration for sanctimonious theatrics.
1024020	1027920	And when everyone's super, no one will be.
1027920	1032380	Just like the case with Syndrome fighting the Omnidroid, many of our most widely worshipped
1032380	1035220	heroes may be entirely contrived.
1035220	1039620	The Incredibles suggest that we choose our heroes carefully because the most sinister
1039620	1042600	villains may be hiding in plain sight.
1042600	1047540	Sometimes the people we end up hating the most are the ones we fool ourselves into loving.
1047540	1051860	In spite of everything you've done for them, eventually they will hate you.
1051860	1057280	You either die a hero, or you live long enough to see yourself become the villain.
1057280	1063100	We tend to use the terms villain and antagonist interchangeably, but are they really the same thing?
1063100	1067500	In a literary sense, the antagonist is simply the character who impedes the goals of the
1067500	1072460	protagonist, and the protagonist is simply the main character of the story.
1072500	1077700	Contrary to popular belief, villains and protagonists are not mutually exclusive.
1077700	1082380	On rare occasions you will see a villain so renowned that they require their own story.
1082380	1085660	So what happens when a villain becomes the protagonist?
1085660	1088780	Well, you end up with a character like the Joker.
1088780	1090780	Hi.
1094340	1099280	The Joker is quite possibly the most iconic villain in all of popular culture.
1099280	1104400	As the nemesis to Batman, one of the most recognizable superheroes, the Joker exploded
1104400	1109680	in popularity after his legendary portrayal in the 2008 film The Dark Knight.
1109680	1114240	The untimely death of Heath Ledger infused an air of mysticism to the performance and
1114240	1115520	the character.
1115520	1119680	The Dark Knight Joker has been described by many as one of the most likable villains of
1119680	1120880	all time.
1120880	1126800	He is the consummate bad guy, a glorious amalgamation of all the villains I listed so far.
1126800	1129280	He is tragically scarred like Zuko.
1129280	1133200	His motives transcend our comprehension like HAL 9000.
1133200	1136040	He is a measured psychopath like Chigurh.
1136040	1141120	Much like Fletcher, his actions corrupt and transform a hero into his own image.
1141120	1146160	And much like Syndrome, he was created out of a disillusionment with his former idol.
1146160	1150000	Eleven years after The Dark Knight, we got to see the Joker star in his own standalone
1150000	1154160	movie, but in the months leading up to the film's release, something very odd started
1154160	1155160	happening.
1155160	1159760	The mainstream media began pumping out article after article fearing that the new Joker movie
1159760	1162480	would inspire acts of violence.
1162480	1166520	Director Todd Phillips and lead actor Joaquin Phoenix were repeatedly grilled over their
1166520	1170760	role in creating such an irresponsible glorification of murder.
1170760	1176800	This was a film that came out the same year as John Wick 3, a 143 minute montage of Keanu
1176800	1182600	Reeves gallantly executing more than 160 people, and a film that received no such concerns
1182600	1184720	over violence from the media.
1184720	1187280	So why was Joker so heavily scrutinized?
1187280	1191960	Well, by the time it premiered, it became immediately obvious why out of touch media
1191960	1195120	elites weren't exactly thrilled with the film.
1195120	1199920	In an outcome that was precisely in line with the themes of the movie, Joker was scorned
1199920	1203120	by the establishment and beloved by the masses.
1203120	1208800	It's a film that highlights the most salient conflict of our time, man versus society.
1208800	1212160	It's a film that, for many of us, speaks straight from the heart.
1212400	1216400	If it was me dying on the sidewalk, you'd walk right over me.
1216400	1220520	Some like to say that Joaquin Phoenix wasn't acting when he delivered this line.
1220520	1224260	It's a reference to the real-life passing of his brother, River, who died of a drug
1224260	1228360	overdose on the sidewalk in front of a Hollywood nightclub.
1228360	1230760	Society is a cruel and unforgiving place.
1230760	1234720	It spits out mentally ill loners like the Joker every single day.
1234720	1240040	The media who chastised this movie for glorifying violence do the very same thing every time
1240040	1242200	one of these people snaps.
1242200	1248060	We all like to fetishize the outcomes of these massacres while completely ignoring the journey.
1248060	1249880	Joker shows us that journey.
1249880	1254560	It puts us inside the mind of the madman and suggests that all of us are accomplices to
1254560	1255880	the bloodshed.
1255880	1260400	John Wick could slaughter a million grunts in his wacky assassin world, but nothing he
1260400	1265080	does will ever have the same impact as the Joker firing a single bullet through the skull
1265080	1266800	of Murray Franklin.
1266800	1271840	The Joker terrifies us not because he kills people, but because he makes us enjoy watching
1271840	1273400	him kill people.
1273400	1279320	No other piece of media in recent memory has made more people question their idea of morality.
1279320	1281740	There's a little piece of the Joker in all of us.
1281740	1285760	It's why many find the character so sympathetic and relatable.
1285760	1288900	Was the Joker justified in killing Murray?
1288900	1292820	Everything we've been taught in our entire lives would tell us no, but many of us would
1292820	1297100	be lying if we said that scene wasn't at least a little bit cathartic.
1297100	1302180	Of course, the movie never inspired any real-life violence, but it did make a tremendous impact
1302180	1303780	on popular culture.
1303780	1308580	For many, it perfectly captured the zeitgeist of growing discontent in an increasingly chaotic
1308580	1309580	world.
1309580	1314320	The spirit of the film has only grown in a year that featured mass political unrest and
1314320	1317420	building frustration with social institutions.
1317420	1322700	The Joker is one of the most memorable villains because he is so frighteningly close to reality,
1322700	1326820	and the newest installment of the character only added to the legacy of fiction's most
1326820	1328180	popular villain.
1328180	1332500	Joker is profoundly uncomfortable and eternally controversial.
1332500	1336400	It forces us to confront the ugliest parts of the human condition.
1336400	1339740	At the end of the day, isn't that the ultimate point of a villain?
1339740	1345300	I don't want to kill you.
1345300	1347300	What would I do without you?
1347300	1348300	No.
1348300	1349860	No, you.
1349860	1353220	You complete me.
1353220	1356980	Fiction helps us mentally process conflict in the real world.
1356980	1360940	When growing up, we're taught about good and evil as a way to avoid discussing the true
1360940	1363380	complexities of actual issues.
1363380	1367500	By the time we get older, we begin to realize that the world is not as black and white as
1367500	1369340	we were led to believe.
1369340	1372900	As much as we hate them, villains are a necessary evil.
1372900	1375140	They push us to our absolute limit.
1375140	1378580	They motivate us to aspire for something greater.
1378580	1382820	Without any villains to defeat, the role of a hero is meaningless.
1382820	1387580	Everyone is the protagonist of their own story, and we are free to choose our antagonists
1387580	1391040	based on our own beliefs and attitudes towards the world.
1391040	1396000	From a certain point of view, anybody can be either reveled or reviled.
1396000	1400680	So be careful who you call the bad guy, because one day you might just end up feeling sympathy
1400680	1402580	for the villain.
1403580	1413860	But also aboard the ship is Commander Nefarious, Captain Imabadguy, and Admiral Bone to pick.
1413860	1414860	But they don't mention them.
