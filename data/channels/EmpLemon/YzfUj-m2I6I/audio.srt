1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,940
The ancient Chinese believed in the philosophical concept of yin and yang, two opposing forces

2
00:00:08,940 --> 00:00:11,680
which complement and complete each other.

3
00:00:11,680 --> 00:00:15,980
Yin and yang are most often depicted with this symbol, the taijitu.

4
00:00:15,980 --> 00:00:20,380
Although the light and dark sides defy each other, each contains a piece of the other

5
00:00:20,380 --> 00:00:22,940
fundamentally embedded within.

6
00:00:22,940 --> 00:00:27,400
Together the opposing forces exist in a state of balanced equilibrium.

7
00:00:27,400 --> 00:00:32,280
Numerous examples of yin and yang exist in nature, such as the brightest light creating

8
00:00:32,280 --> 00:00:34,040
the harshest shadows.

9
00:00:34,040 --> 00:00:39,160
But perhaps the most fascinating application of yin and yang exists in the realm of fiction,

10
00:00:39,160 --> 00:00:45,420
in the relationship between heroes and villains.

11
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:48,240
We all grow up listening to the same kind of story.

12
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:52,480
A valiant hero overcomes the odds to defeat a despicable villain.

13
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:56,340
We learn to view heroes and villains as part of a binary system.

14
00:00:56,340 --> 00:00:59,780
We root for the good guys and root against the bad guys.

15
00:00:59,780 --> 00:01:03,680
It's a principle that all but defines the essence of storytelling.

16
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:09,300
As children we view this as an unbreakable law, but as we get older something very mysterious

17
00:01:09,300 --> 00:01:10,300
happens.

18
00:01:10,300 --> 00:01:13,740
The line between heroes and villains starts to blur.

19
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:18,260
All of a sudden heroes start to look a lot more lame, while villains become all the more

20
00:01:18,260 --> 00:01:19,440
appealing.

21
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:24,040
If you look at the word villain in the dictionary, nearly every definition you'll find will mention

22
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:25,380
the word evil.

23
00:01:25,380 --> 00:01:27,540
But what exactly is evil?

24
00:01:27,540 --> 00:01:32,580
Well in most cultures the concept of good and evil are tied to our premise of morality.

25
00:01:32,580 --> 00:01:38,140
Our morality is often determined by whatever religious or spiritual code we grew up with.

26
00:01:38,140 --> 00:01:41,840
Religions across the globe embody evil through the image of the devil.

27
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:47,140
As the face of evil for the world's most popular religion, Satan is likely the most infamous

28
00:01:47,140 --> 00:01:49,840
villain in human history.

29
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:58,400
Most religions portray me as the incarnate of evil, meaning my actions literally define

30
00:01:58,400 --> 00:02:01,120
what it is to be immoral.

31
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:03,240
It's tough to get more evil than that.

32
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:06,480
In fact, it's impossible.

33
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:10,800
Each version of the devil shares similar traits, but none are identical.

34
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:14,800
There is no definitive answer for what constitutes an evil action.

35
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:22,380
Right, I can see that I will have to teach you how to be villains.

36
00:02:22,380 --> 00:02:27,320
The notion of evil is an abstraction and can be altered depending on the society in place

37
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:28,880
around us.

38
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:33,760
Evil assumes the purpose of a blanket term attributed to people who cause us negative

39
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:35,220
outcomes.

40
00:02:35,220 --> 00:02:39,520
Morality is one of the most difficult concepts for the human mind to understand.

41
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:42,860
Everyone has their own set of complex needs and motivations.

42
00:02:42,860 --> 00:02:47,400
It's much easier to just look at the source of all your suffering and call it evil.

43
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:52,860
It's much easier to write a story and have the antagonist do bad things because they're

44
00:02:52,860 --> 00:02:53,860
evil.

45
00:02:53,860 --> 00:02:57,500
Unfortunately, evil villains also tend to be forgettable villains.

46
00:02:57,500 --> 00:03:00,720
I mean, does anybody really remember Maleficent?

47
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:03,520
Her name is a literal synonym for evil.

48
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:07,900
The problem with evil characters is that we have a hard time relating to them.

49
00:03:07,900 --> 00:03:12,060
Contrary to what the media will tell you, the average person doesn't tend to enjoy doing

50
00:03:12,060 --> 00:03:13,660
malicious things.

51
00:03:13,660 --> 00:03:18,080
To create a truly memorable villain, you have to connect them with the audience in a meaningful

52
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:19,080
way.

53
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:23,520
One of the most common and effective methods of achieving this is to establish a transformation

54
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:29,620
from friend to fiend.

55
00:03:29,620 --> 00:03:34,380
The most well-known example of this transformation is the character of Darth Vader.

56
00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:39,300
In A New Hope, Vader is more or less presented as a standard formidable bad guy without much

57
00:03:39,300 --> 00:03:40,820
character depth.

58
00:03:40,820 --> 00:03:45,160
We're told he was once good, but we don't actually get to see this dimension of Vader

59
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:50,180
until the Empire Strikes Back, where for the first time we catch a glimpse of what he looks

60
00:03:50,180 --> 00:03:52,340
like beneath the mask.

61
00:03:52,340 --> 00:03:56,640
It's a shot that only lasts a few seconds, but it profoundly influences our perception

62
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:58,280
of Vader's character.

63
00:03:58,280 --> 00:04:03,020
The film reveals that he was involved in some kind of horrific incident which left him permanently

64
00:04:03,020 --> 00:04:05,300
disfigured and scarred.

65
00:04:05,300 --> 00:04:09,900
Scars are a powerful visual and metaphorical tool to humanize a villain.

66
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:15,560
They represent significant trauma and vulnerability, traits unlike anything we've seen in Vader

67
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:17,500
before that point.

68
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:34,540
One of the most iconic scars in fiction belongs to Prince Zuko from Avatar.

69
00:04:34,540 --> 00:04:38,780
The series begins with Zuko as the sole antagonist to the heroes.

70
00:04:38,780 --> 00:04:44,420
However, as the story goes on, it reveals the far more brutal framework around him.

71
00:04:44,420 --> 00:04:48,940
We eventually learn about his tragic origin and figure out that it was not nature, but

72
00:04:48,940 --> 00:04:52,380
nurture which made Zuko into the villain he is.

73
00:04:52,380 --> 00:04:57,060
He is driven not by an evil plan, but by the desire to redeem himself in the eyes of his

74
00:04:57,060 --> 00:04:58,860
father and his nation.

75
00:04:58,860 --> 00:05:04,780
Zuko is made relatable by being a very imperfect character, symbolized by his most striking

76
00:05:04,780 --> 00:05:06,820
physical feature.

77
00:05:06,820 --> 00:05:12,140
Despite his immense dedication and willpower, he leaves behind a legacy of failure.

78
00:05:12,140 --> 00:05:16,860
There's no doubt that Zuko suffers more than any other character in the series.

79
00:05:16,860 --> 00:05:21,300
After a while, you kind of forget he's the bad guy and just want to see him be happy.

80
00:05:21,300 --> 00:05:25,780
Ironically, Zuko's villainous path is only forged through his obsession with being a

81
00:05:25,780 --> 00:05:27,900
hero for the Fire Nation.

82
00:05:27,940 --> 00:05:33,340
At the end of the day, Zuko is only seeking what we all desire, belonging and acceptance

83
00:05:33,340 --> 00:05:34,940
from his peers.

84
00:05:34,940 --> 00:05:39,660
His scar is a physical token representing the insurmountable division between he and

85
00:05:39,660 --> 00:05:41,380
his ideal being.

86
00:05:41,380 --> 00:05:47,060
He sacrifices so much trying to overcome it, but the scar, like the past, can never be

87
00:05:47,060 --> 00:05:48,260
erased.

88
00:05:48,260 --> 00:05:52,980
It is only when Zuko learns to embrace his hardship that he truly becomes the person

89
00:05:52,980 --> 00:05:54,300
he was meant to be.

90
00:05:54,820 --> 00:05:59,580
I used to think this scar marked me, the mark of the Banished Prince, cursed to chase the

91
00:05:59,580 --> 00:06:06,300
Avatar forever, but lately, I've realized I'm free to determine my own destiny, even

92
00:06:06,300 --> 00:06:08,900
if I'll never be free of my mark.

93
00:06:08,900 --> 00:06:14,460
In the end, he fulfills his destiny as a hero, just not in the same way he envisioned.

94
00:06:14,460 --> 00:06:19,660
Zuko is a memorable villain because he is one of the most human villains ever written,

95
00:06:19,660 --> 00:06:22,540
but what about a villain that is the opposite of human?

96
00:06:24,700 --> 00:06:28,620
I don't know what the hell's in there, but it's weird and pissed off, whatever it is.

97
00:06:29,580 --> 00:06:35,100
Science fiction is no stranger to featuring antagonists of a more cosmological origin.

98
00:06:35,100 --> 00:06:40,980
This Halloween, I talked about John Carpenter's 1982 horror film The Thing, a story that features

99
00:06:40,980 --> 00:06:45,860
a shape-shifting alien which serves as an allegory for mistrust and paranoia.

100
00:06:45,860 --> 00:06:48,820
The monster from The Thing is akin to the works of H.P.

101
00:06:48,820 --> 00:06:51,620
Lovecraft and the premise of cosmic horror.

102
00:06:51,620 --> 00:06:56,420
The idea that human beings are insignificant compared to the unfathomable vastness of the

103
00:06:56,420 --> 00:06:57,740
universe.

104
00:06:57,740 --> 00:07:00,900
Lovecraftian monsters defy comprehension.

105
00:07:00,900 --> 00:07:04,940
They transcend our narrow purview of morality and evil.

106
00:07:04,940 --> 00:07:08,260
These antagonists frighten us on a more primal level.

107
00:07:08,260 --> 00:07:14,020
They represent a manifestation of mankind's most fundamental adversary, nature.

108
00:07:14,020 --> 00:07:18,500
There is no greater threat to human progress than the forces of nature, and no greater

109
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:21,580
threat to nature than human progress.

110
00:07:21,580 --> 00:07:26,780
Thanks to our technological advancements, man sits atop the animal kingdom uncontested.

111
00:07:26,780 --> 00:07:31,100
Fictional monsters like The Thing remind us of a time when that wasn't the case.

112
00:07:31,100 --> 00:07:34,700
A time when we were not predators, but prey.

113
00:07:34,700 --> 00:07:39,740
No one on Earth can literally remember being hunted by a sabercat, but the impression lingers

114
00:07:39,740 --> 00:07:43,980
as an integral phobia baked into our evolutionary programming.

115
00:07:43,980 --> 00:07:48,580
Now that no other animal can challenge us, it's up to our imagination to create something

116
00:07:48,580 --> 00:07:49,740
that can.

117
00:07:49,740 --> 00:07:54,100
Perhaps our ultimate undoing won't come from nature, but from the very technology

118
00:07:54,100 --> 00:07:55,980
we use to conquer it.

119
00:07:55,980 --> 00:08:00,820
I know that you and Frank were planning to disconnect me, and I'm afraid that's something

120
00:08:00,820 --> 00:08:03,540
I cannot allow to happen.

121
00:08:03,540 --> 00:08:09,740
2001 was the first prominent film to feature artificial intelligence as a major antagonist.

122
00:08:09,740 --> 00:08:15,460
The premise of a rogue AI takes the relationship of man versus nature and inverts it.

123
00:08:15,460 --> 00:08:20,900
Just as human beings are a product of nature, machines are a product of humanity.

124
00:08:20,900 --> 00:08:26,780
Characters like HAL 9000 reverse our perspective of a creation overtaking its creator.

125
00:08:26,780 --> 00:08:31,520
Perhaps we, like nature before us, merely exist as the next stepping stone in the progression

126
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:36,820
of intelligent life, and we, like nature, are doomed to be conquered by whatever comes

127
00:08:36,820 --> 00:08:37,820
next.

128
00:08:37,820 --> 00:08:42,580
At least for now the technological takeover remains in the realm of fiction, but rogue

129
00:08:42,580 --> 00:08:46,780
AI and other intelligent monsters do provide us with a unique conflict.

130
00:08:46,780 --> 00:08:50,260
They don't operate within trivial human desire.

131
00:08:50,260 --> 00:08:54,620
Godzilla won't stop destroying the city out of any moralistic epiphany.

132
00:08:54,620 --> 00:08:59,460
The most terrifying part of antagonists like these is not that we can't understand them,

133
00:08:59,460 --> 00:09:02,120
but that they can't understand us.

134
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:07,020
To them, all of our petty rules and emotions are utterly meaningless.

135
00:09:07,020 --> 00:09:19,060
If the rule you followed brought you to this, of what use was the rule?

136
00:09:19,060 --> 00:09:23,980
Somewhere in the middle of Monster and Man you'll find a character like Anton Chigurh.

137
00:09:23,980 --> 00:09:29,940
In 2014 a team of Belgian psychiatrists analyzed more than 400 villains across cinema and found

138
00:09:29,940 --> 00:09:34,280
Chigurh the single most realistic representation of a psychopath.

139
00:09:34,280 --> 00:09:39,460
His total emotional disconnect to murder was similar to many real-life hitmen the researchers

140
00:09:39,460 --> 00:09:40,460
interviewed.

141
00:09:40,460 --> 00:09:43,620
Chigurh is a profoundly strange character.

142
00:09:43,620 --> 00:09:47,380
His origin, background and overall motives are all unknown.

143
00:09:47,380 --> 00:09:50,140
He is described as somewhat of a phantom.

144
00:09:50,140 --> 00:09:55,740
Many have analyzed the character as a rhetorical link between man and God, more specifically

145
00:09:55,740 --> 00:09:58,000
as an agent of fate.

146
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:02,960
To Chigurh, human beings are no different than cattle waiting for slaughter, a perspective

147
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:07,300
harshly illustrated through his means of execution.

148
00:10:07,300 --> 00:10:12,680
To him, human life is completely dispensable, but despite savagely murdering a dozen people

149
00:10:12,680 --> 00:10:17,680
in the film, it's difficult to describe Chigurh's motivation as malicious.

150
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:21,500
Is it malicious when a tornado demolishes a Midwestern home?

151
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:24,800
The film portrays Chigurh as an unstoppable force.

152
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:29,340
It is stated that no one who sees him lives, but that's not entirely true.

153
00:10:29,340 --> 00:10:33,620
The most intriguing insights into Chigurh's character occur not when he kills, but when

154
00:10:33,620 --> 00:10:35,620
he chooses not to kill.

155
00:10:35,620 --> 00:10:39,780
Of course, if you asked him, he'd probably tell you that there was never really any choice

156
00:10:39,780 --> 00:10:40,780
in the matter.

157
00:10:40,780 --> 00:10:45,540
Chigurh's actions are dictated by a strict personal code of conduct that's never fully

158
00:10:45,540 --> 00:10:46,540
explained.

159
00:10:46,540 --> 00:10:49,500
All of his kills have a consistent logic to them.

160
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:53,860
Most of the victims were simply dispatched as a cut-and-dry means of completing his primary

161
00:10:53,860 --> 00:10:54,900
objective.

162
00:10:54,900 --> 00:11:00,100
It's only through ambiguous situations when we capture a glimpse into Chigurh's philosophy.

163
00:11:00,100 --> 00:11:05,020
In the iconic gas station scene, he contemplates killing the clerk but offers him an out in

164
00:11:05,020 --> 00:11:06,820
the form of a coin toss.

165
00:11:06,820 --> 00:11:11,460
Pragmatically speaking, the coin toss is a meaningless gesture, but within Chigurh's

166
00:11:11,460 --> 00:11:15,780
internal principles, it allows him to act independently of a conscience.

167
00:11:15,780 --> 00:11:18,740
The nature of Chigurh's character is deterministic.

168
00:11:18,740 --> 00:11:23,780
By acting as the hand of fate, he relinquishes his own agency over situations.

169
00:11:23,780 --> 00:11:28,740
He operates automatically, never deviating from the most efficient path towards his eventual

170
00:11:28,740 --> 00:11:29,740
outcome.

171
00:11:29,740 --> 00:11:35,180
The idea of people feebly trying to exercise control over their destiny confuses and disgusts

172
00:11:35,180 --> 00:11:36,180
him.

173
00:11:36,180 --> 00:11:40,420
If mercy exists in Chigurh's universe, it can only be found in something as brutally

174
00:11:40,420 --> 00:11:42,420
random as a coin toss.

175
00:11:42,420 --> 00:11:47,540
It's been traveling 22 years to get here, and now it's here.

176
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:49,740
And it's either heads or tails.

177
00:11:49,740 --> 00:11:54,580
It's for this reason why some people have defined Chigurh as the embodiment of chaos.

178
00:11:54,580 --> 00:11:59,060
The relative unpredictability of the character creates the striking tension for which the

179
00:11:59,060 --> 00:12:00,620
film is so celebrated.

180
00:12:00,620 --> 00:12:05,760
However, Chigurh is paradoxically the most calculated, meticulous, and orderly character

181
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:07,080
in the story.

182
00:12:07,080 --> 00:12:11,500
If we all knew what he knew, all of his actions would make perfect sense.

183
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:14,240
Such is the confounding nature of a psychopath.

184
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:16,540
They exist in the uncanny valley.

185
00:12:16,540 --> 00:12:21,220
Although they resemble us on a physical level, we will never understand them on a mental

186
00:12:21,220 --> 00:12:22,220
level.

187
00:12:22,220 --> 00:12:26,900
They represent a different kind of human being, those who cultivate order out of chaos.

188
00:12:26,900 --> 00:12:32,460
Do you have any idea how crazy you are?

189
00:12:32,460 --> 00:12:37,400
Madness is a truly terrifying concept, one that is ultimately governed by the same principles

190
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:39,300
of a coin toss.

191
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:42,740
The coin don't have no say.

192
00:12:42,740 --> 00:12:43,740
It's just you.

193
00:12:43,740 --> 00:12:48,780
I got here the same way the coin did.

194
00:12:48,780 --> 00:12:53,300
At the end of the day, it's not our futile attempts at bravery, reasoning, or law enforcement

195
00:12:53,300 --> 00:12:54,980
which stop Chigurh.

196
00:12:54,980 --> 00:13:02,640
His justice can only be served by fate itself.

197
00:13:02,640 --> 00:13:10,420
Sometimes it's more than just fate which stands in the way of our ultimate goal.

198
00:13:10,420 --> 00:13:20,180
There are no two words in the English language more harmful than good job.

199
00:13:20,180 --> 00:13:24,780
In the pursuit of perfection, we may find ourselves in the essential conflict of student

200
00:13:24,780 --> 00:13:26,380
versus master.

201
00:13:26,380 --> 00:13:31,120
This conflict is intimately explored in the 2014 film Whiplash.

202
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:34,540
Terence Fletcher is the consummate stalwart of success.

203
00:13:34,540 --> 00:13:39,160
Andrew Neiman is chasing success, but his desire to impress Fletcher transforms his

204
00:13:39,160 --> 00:13:41,200
passion into an obsession.

205
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:45,800
Neiman is forced to endure a torturous gauntlet of emotional and physical trauma that have

206
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:49,940
inspired many to label Fletcher as one of cinema's cruelest villains.

207
00:13:49,940 --> 00:13:54,420
He is an unrelenting critic, honing in on imperfections that are indistinguishable to

208
00:13:54,420 --> 00:13:55,920
the average listener.

209
00:13:55,920 --> 00:14:00,440
He demolishes his students' confidence by setting the bar of excellence insurmountably

210
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:01,440
high.

211
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:06,200
Fletcher's methods are borderline sadistic, however, the more abuse he hurls at Neiman,

212
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:08,820
the more Neiman refuses to concede.

213
00:14:08,820 --> 00:14:13,820
Despite their bitter adversarial relationship, both characters are ultimately working towards

214
00:14:13,820 --> 00:14:18,760
the same goal, overcoming the gap between proficiency and mastery.

215
00:14:18,760 --> 00:14:21,420
What separates greatness from mediocrity?

216
00:14:21,420 --> 00:14:25,260
Perhaps it is practice, dedication, raw talent or dumb luck.

217
00:14:25,260 --> 00:14:30,340
Well, according to the film, greatness is embedded deep within us and it's up to antagonists

218
00:14:30,340 --> 00:14:33,140
like Fletcher to extract our potential.

219
00:14:33,140 --> 00:14:38,020
Throughout the film, Neiman is not just battling Fletcher, he is also battling himself.

220
00:14:38,220 --> 00:14:44,140
Fletcher's character is largely a manifestation of our ability to improve as an individual.

221
00:14:44,140 --> 00:14:48,600
Even though Neiman wants more than anything to overcome Fletcher, he can't help but find

222
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:51,660
himself forming a mutual respect for the man.

223
00:14:51,660 --> 00:14:57,240
As Fletcher hammers him with ruthless perfectionism, Neiman finds himself becoming more ruthless

224
00:14:57,240 --> 00:15:00,000
as he closes in on perfection.

225
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:04,980
In the end, he gives up everything, his friends, family, romance, health and dignity all to

226
00:15:04,980 --> 00:15:07,260
chase the mastery of his craft.

227
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:12,260
Fletcher broke Neiman down into nothing and then resurrected him in his own image.

228
00:15:12,260 --> 00:15:17,440
Most of us remember Fletcher as a cruel master who demanded excellence no matter the cost,

229
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:20,980
an archetype not uncommon to many competitive professions.

230
00:15:20,980 --> 00:15:25,860
However, the character should also be renowned as a prime example of a villain converging

231
00:15:25,860 --> 00:15:27,220
with the hero.

232
00:15:27,220 --> 00:15:31,140
To truly defeat Fletcher, Neiman had to become Fletcher.

233
00:15:31,140 --> 00:15:36,020
See, now you respect me, because I'm a threat.

234
00:15:37,260 --> 00:15:45,040
But what about a case where instead of transforming into the villain, the hero creates the villain?

235
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:48,740
To find this, you have to look no further than the relationship between Syndrome and

236
00:15:48,740 --> 00:15:50,160
Mr. Incredible.

237
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:54,500
The story of a hero's biggest fan turning into his biggest nemesis.

238
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:59,820
Unlike the case in Whiplash, Syndrome's obsessive turn is spawned out of neglect from his former

239
00:15:59,820 --> 00:16:00,820
idol.

240
00:16:00,820 --> 00:16:05,260
The Incredibles is a film which dissects the anatomy of heroes and villains.

241
00:16:05,260 --> 00:16:09,300
When you boil it down, how do we really define a heroic action?

242
00:16:09,300 --> 00:16:13,820
In his analysis of the film, YouTube reviewer The Real Jims made the intriguing point that

243
00:16:13,820 --> 00:16:19,380
in other Pixar films, Buddy would be the protagonist, the scrappy underdog who gets told by the

244
00:16:19,380 --> 00:16:22,020
world around him that he's not good enough.

245
00:16:22,020 --> 00:16:26,260
Where the character deviates from the archetype is in his misplaced priorities and what it

246
00:16:26,260 --> 00:16:28,440
means to be a hero.

247
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:33,220
The Incredibles subverts the ethos of the prototypical Pixar formula by examining how

248
00:16:33,220 --> 00:16:38,300
the underdog's story could actually corrupt someone who takes it too much to heart.

249
00:16:38,300 --> 00:16:43,260
Syndrome gets more caught up in the fanfare of heroics than the true moral significance.

250
00:16:43,260 --> 00:16:48,300
His name may very well be a reference to hero syndrome, the term used to describe the phenomenon

251
00:16:48,300 --> 00:16:51,840
of firefighters intentionally committing acts of arson.

252
00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:56,640
Since the release of the film, this circumstance has become even more apropos through the rise

253
00:16:56,640 --> 00:16:58,100
of social media.

254
00:16:58,100 --> 00:17:04,020
We now live in a world where anybody can receive public adoration for sanctimonious theatrics.

255
00:17:04,020 --> 00:17:07,920
And when everyone's super, no one will be.

256
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:12,380
Just like the case with Syndrome fighting the Omnidroid, many of our most widely worshipped

257
00:17:12,380 --> 00:17:15,220
heroes may be entirely contrived.

258
00:17:15,220 --> 00:17:19,620
The Incredibles suggest that we choose our heroes carefully because the most sinister

259
00:17:19,620 --> 00:17:22,600
villains may be hiding in plain sight.

260
00:17:22,600 --> 00:17:27,540
Sometimes the people we end up hating the most are the ones we fool ourselves into loving.

261
00:17:27,540 --> 00:17:31,860
In spite of everything you've done for them, eventually they will hate you.

262
00:17:31,860 --> 00:17:37,280
You either die a hero, or you live long enough to see yourself become the villain.

263
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:43,100
We tend to use the terms villain and antagonist interchangeably, but are they really the same thing?

264
00:17:43,100 --> 00:17:47,500
In a literary sense, the antagonist is simply the character who impedes the goals of the

265
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:52,460
protagonist, and the protagonist is simply the main character of the story.

266
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:57,700
Contrary to popular belief, villains and protagonists are not mutually exclusive.

267
00:17:57,700 --> 00:18:02,380
On rare occasions you will see a villain so renowned that they require their own story.

268
00:18:02,380 --> 00:18:05,660
So what happens when a villain becomes the protagonist?

269
00:18:05,660 --> 00:18:08,780
Well, you end up with a character like the Joker.

270
00:18:08,780 --> 00:18:10,780
Hi.

271
00:18:14,340 --> 00:18:19,280
The Joker is quite possibly the most iconic villain in all of popular culture.

272
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:24,400
As the nemesis to Batman, one of the most recognizable superheroes, the Joker exploded

273
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:29,680
in popularity after his legendary portrayal in the 2008 film The Dark Knight.

274
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:34,240
The untimely death of Heath Ledger infused an air of mysticism to the performance and

275
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:35,520
the character.

276
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:39,680
The Dark Knight Joker has been described by many as one of the most likable villains of

277
00:18:39,680 --> 00:18:40,880
all time.

278
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:46,800
He is the consummate bad guy, a glorious amalgamation of all the villains I listed so far.

279
00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:49,280
He is tragically scarred like Zuko.

280
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:53,200
His motives transcend our comprehension like HAL 9000.

281
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:56,040
He is a measured psychopath like Chigurh.

282
00:18:56,040 --> 00:19:01,120
Much like Fletcher, his actions corrupt and transform a hero into his own image.

283
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:06,160
And much like Syndrome, he was created out of a disillusionment with his former idol.

284
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:10,000
Eleven years after The Dark Knight, we got to see the Joker star in his own standalone

285
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:14,160
movie, but in the months leading up to the film's release, something very odd started

286
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:15,160
happening.

287
00:19:15,160 --> 00:19:19,760
The mainstream media began pumping out article after article fearing that the new Joker movie

288
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:22,480
would inspire acts of violence.

289
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:26,520
Director Todd Phillips and lead actor Joaquin Phoenix were repeatedly grilled over their

290
00:19:26,520 --> 00:19:30,760
role in creating such an irresponsible glorification of murder.

291
00:19:30,760 --> 00:19:36,800
This was a film that came out the same year as John Wick 3, a 143 minute montage of Keanu

292
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:42,600
Reeves gallantly executing more than 160 people, and a film that received no such concerns

293
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:44,720
over violence from the media.

294
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:47,280
So why was Joker so heavily scrutinized?

295
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:51,960
Well, by the time it premiered, it became immediately obvious why out of touch media

296
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:55,120
elites weren't exactly thrilled with the film.

297
00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:59,920
In an outcome that was precisely in line with the themes of the movie, Joker was scorned

298
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:03,120
by the establishment and beloved by the masses.

299
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:08,800
It's a film that highlights the most salient conflict of our time, man versus society.

300
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:12,160
It's a film that, for many of us, speaks straight from the heart.

301
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:16,400
If it was me dying on the sidewalk, you'd walk right over me.

302
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:20,520
Some like to say that Joaquin Phoenix wasn't acting when he delivered this line.

303
00:20:20,520 --> 00:20:24,260
It's a reference to the real-life passing of his brother, River, who died of a drug

304
00:20:24,260 --> 00:20:28,360
overdose on the sidewalk in front of a Hollywood nightclub.

305
00:20:28,360 --> 00:20:30,760
Society is a cruel and unforgiving place.

306
00:20:30,760 --> 00:20:34,720
It spits out mentally ill loners like the Joker every single day.

307
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:40,040
The media who chastised this movie for glorifying violence do the very same thing every time

308
00:20:40,040 --> 00:20:42,200
one of these people snaps.

309
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:48,060
We all like to fetishize the outcomes of these massacres while completely ignoring the journey.

310
00:20:48,060 --> 00:20:49,880
Joker shows us that journey.

311
00:20:49,880 --> 00:20:54,560
It puts us inside the mind of the madman and suggests that all of us are accomplices to

312
00:20:54,560 --> 00:20:55,880
the bloodshed.

313
00:20:55,880 --> 00:21:00,400
John Wick could slaughter a million grunts in his wacky assassin world, but nothing he

314
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:05,080
does will ever have the same impact as the Joker firing a single bullet through the skull

315
00:21:05,080 --> 00:21:06,800
of Murray Franklin.

316
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:11,840
The Joker terrifies us not because he kills people, but because he makes us enjoy watching

317
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:13,400
him kill people.

318
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:19,320
No other piece of media in recent memory has made more people question their idea of morality.

319
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:21,740
There's a little piece of the Joker in all of us.

320
00:21:21,740 --> 00:21:25,760
It's why many find the character so sympathetic and relatable.

321
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:28,900
Was the Joker justified in killing Murray?

322
00:21:28,900 --> 00:21:32,820
Everything we've been taught in our entire lives would tell us no, but many of us would

323
00:21:32,820 --> 00:21:37,100
be lying if we said that scene wasn't at least a little bit cathartic.

324
00:21:37,100 --> 00:21:42,180
Of course, the movie never inspired any real-life violence, but it did make a tremendous impact

325
00:21:42,180 --> 00:21:43,780
on popular culture.

326
00:21:43,780 --> 00:21:48,580
For many, it perfectly captured the zeitgeist of growing discontent in an increasingly chaotic

327
00:21:48,580 --> 00:21:49,580
world.

328
00:21:49,580 --> 00:21:54,320
The spirit of the film has only grown in a year that featured mass political unrest and

329
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:57,420
building frustration with social institutions.

330
00:21:57,420 --> 00:22:02,700
The Joker is one of the most memorable villains because he is so frighteningly close to reality,

331
00:22:02,700 --> 00:22:06,820
and the newest installment of the character only added to the legacy of fiction's most

332
00:22:06,820 --> 00:22:08,180
popular villain.

333
00:22:08,180 --> 00:22:12,500
Joker is profoundly uncomfortable and eternally controversial.

334
00:22:12,500 --> 00:22:16,400
It forces us to confront the ugliest parts of the human condition.

335
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:19,740
At the end of the day, isn't that the ultimate point of a villain?

336
00:22:19,740 --> 00:22:25,300
I don't want to kill you.

337
00:22:25,300 --> 00:22:27,300
What would I do without you?

338
00:22:27,300 --> 00:22:28,300
No.

339
00:22:28,300 --> 00:22:29,860
No, you.

340
00:22:29,860 --> 00:22:33,220
You complete me.

341
00:22:33,220 --> 00:22:36,980
Fiction helps us mentally process conflict in the real world.

342
00:22:36,980 --> 00:22:40,940
When growing up, we're taught about good and evil as a way to avoid discussing the true

343
00:22:40,940 --> 00:22:43,380
complexities of actual issues.

344
00:22:43,380 --> 00:22:47,500
By the time we get older, we begin to realize that the world is not as black and white as

345
00:22:47,500 --> 00:22:49,340
we were led to believe.

346
00:22:49,340 --> 00:22:52,900
As much as we hate them, villains are a necessary evil.

347
00:22:52,900 --> 00:22:55,140
They push us to our absolute limit.

348
00:22:55,140 --> 00:22:58,580
They motivate us to aspire for something greater.

349
00:22:58,580 --> 00:23:02,820
Without any villains to defeat, the role of a hero is meaningless.

350
00:23:02,820 --> 00:23:07,580
Everyone is the protagonist of their own story, and we are free to choose our antagonists

351
00:23:07,580 --> 00:23:11,040
based on our own beliefs and attitudes towards the world.

352
00:23:11,040 --> 00:23:16,000
From a certain point of view, anybody can be either reveled or reviled.

353
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:20,680
So be careful who you call the bad guy, because one day you might just end up feeling sympathy

354
00:23:20,680 --> 00:23:22,580
for the villain.

355
00:23:23,580 --> 00:23:33,860
But also aboard the ship is Commander Nefarious, Captain Imabadguy, and Admiral Bone to pick.

356
00:23:33,860 --> 00:23:34,860
But they don't mention them.
