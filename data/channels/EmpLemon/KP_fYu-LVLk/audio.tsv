0	12700	Ugana Knuckles is a textbook example of the tragedy of the commons applied to memes.
12700	17700	It started off as a promising little case study into the wild and bizarre autism of VRChat,
17700	22100	and it could have been a good meme had it just stayed within the confines of the online gaming community.
22100	27400	But for some unforeseen reason, this meme attracted a plague of normies who completely blow it up.
27400	34300	And much like maggots consuming a carcass, the normies stripped this meme down to the bone and removed any nuance it may have once had.
34300	41800	In just a matter of weeks, Ugandan Knuckles was reduced to just another image and catchphrase that got spammed to death on everyone's timeline,
41800	46300	and it got spammed so far that online journalists began to write hit pieces on it.
46300	52400	Yeah, turns out poking fun at Africans in today's political climate is a bit of a risky meme,
52400	56800	and it begs the question as to why normies would popularize this meme in the first place.
56800	64800	Whatever the reason, we can all agree that this meme lived a short life and died a horrific malnourished death, just like a true Ugandan.
