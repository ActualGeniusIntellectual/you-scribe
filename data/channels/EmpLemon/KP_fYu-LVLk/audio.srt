Ugana Knuckles is a textbook example of the tragedy of the commons applied to memes.

2
00:00:12,700 --> 00:00:17,700
It started off as a promising little case study into the wild and bizarre autism of VRChat,

3
00:00:17,700 --> 00:00:22,100
and it could have been a good meme had it just stayed within the confines of the online gaming community.

4
00:00:22,100 --> 00:00:27,400
But for some unforeseen reason, this meme attracted a plague of normies who completely blow it up.

5
00:00:27,400 --> 00:00:34,300
And much like maggots consuming a carcass, the normies stripped this meme down to the bone and removed any nuance it may have once had.

6
00:00:34,300 --> 00:00:41,800
In just a matter of weeks, Ugandan Knuckles was reduced to just another image and catchphrase that got spammed to death on everyone's timeline,

7
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:46,300
and it got spammed so far that online journalists began to write hit pieces on it.

8
00:00:46,300 --> 00:00:52,400
Yeah, turns out poking fun at Africans in today's political climate is a bit of a risky meme,

9
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:56,800
and it begs the question as to why normies would popularize this meme in the first place.

10
00:00:56,800 --> 00:01:04,800
Whatever the reason, we can all agree that this meme lived a short life and died a horrific malnourished death, just like a true Ugandan.
