0	13200	This is a meme so bland and repetitive that it actually made some people say enough is enough.
13200	18100	In order to explain what makes this meme so poor, you have to delve into the context of the meme itself.
18100	21100	So what exactly makes the Krusty Krab better than the Chum Bucket?
21100	26500	Well, Mr. Krab simply came up with a delicious original recipe that was better than anything Plankton was selling.
26500	32500	But rather than trying to come up with something new and innovative, Plankton insists on stealing the formula to save his business.
32500	39500	Of course, on TV, Plankton always fails, but this meme represents what happens when Plankton succeeds five times in a row.
39500	44500	This meme is just a stolen formula. Reposted memes are just stolen formulas.
44500	50500	Heck, even this series is a stolen formula, the difference being that I remixed it into something new and distinct.
50500	56000	There's a fine line between innovating an idea and straight-up copying it, and this meme crosses that line.
56000	61500	Supporting this meme is supporting the business model of the Chum Bucket, so stop celebrating unoriginality.
61500	65000	There are plenty of other restaurants in Bikini Bottom.
