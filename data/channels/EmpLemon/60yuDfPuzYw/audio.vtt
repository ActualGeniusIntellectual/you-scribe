This is a meme so bland and repetitive that it actually made some people say enough is enough.

00:13.200 --> 00:18.100
In order to explain what makes this meme so poor, you have to delve into the context of the meme itself.

00:18.100 --> 00:21.100
So what exactly makes the Krusty Krab better than the Chum Bucket?

00:21.100 --> 00:26.500
Well, Mr. Krab simply came up with a delicious original recipe that was better than anything Plankton was selling.

00:26.500 --> 00:32.500
But rather than trying to come up with something new and innovative, Plankton insists on stealing the formula to save his business.

00:32.500 --> 00:39.500
Of course, on TV, Plankton always fails, but this meme represents what happens when Plankton succeeds five times in a row.

00:39.500 --> 00:44.500
This meme is just a stolen formula. Reposted memes are just stolen formulas.

00:44.500 --> 00:50.500
Heck, even this series is a stolen formula, the difference being that I remixed it into something new and distinct.

00:50.500 --> 00:56.000
There's a fine line between innovating an idea and straight-up copying it, and this meme crosses that line.

00:56.000 --> 01:01.500
Supporting this meme is supporting the business model of the Chum Bucket, so stop celebrating unoriginality.

01:01.500 --> 01:05.000
There are plenty of other restaurants in Bikini Bottom.
