00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:13,200
This is a meme so bland and repetitive that it actually made some people say enough is enough.

2
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:18,100
In order to explain what makes this meme so poor, you have to delve into the context of the meme itself.

3
00:00:18,100 --> 00:00:21,100
So what exactly makes the Krusty Krab better than the Chum Bucket?

4
00:00:21,100 --> 00:00:26,500
Well, Mr. Krab simply came up with a delicious original recipe that was better than anything Plankton was selling.

5
00:00:26,500 --> 00:00:32,500
But rather than trying to come up with something new and innovative, Plankton insists on stealing the formula to save his business.

6
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:39,500
Of course, on TV, Plankton always fails, but this meme represents what happens when Plankton succeeds five times in a row.

7
00:00:39,500 --> 00:00:44,500
This meme is just a stolen formula. Reposted memes are just stolen formulas.

8
00:00:44,500 --> 00:00:50,500
Heck, even this series is a stolen formula, the difference being that I remixed it into something new and distinct.

9
00:00:50,500 --> 00:00:56,000
There's a fine line between innovating an idea and straight-up copying it, and this meme crosses that line.

10
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:01,500
Supporting this meme is supporting the business model of the Chum Bucket, so stop celebrating unoriginality.

11
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:05,000
There are plenty of other restaurants in Bikini Bottom.
