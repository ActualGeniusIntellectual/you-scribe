00:00.000 --> 00:13.100
What's the highest you've ever jumped?

00:13.100 --> 00:17.140
For most of us, that number never exceeds more than a few feet, for the simple reason

00:17.140 --> 00:19.980
that jumping off anything higher is terrifying.

00:19.980 --> 00:25.620
Bazophobia, or the fear of falling, is a phobia inherent to humans and many species of animals.

00:25.620 --> 00:30.060
In the visual cliff experiment, a vast majority of infants would not cross what appeared to

00:30.060 --> 00:31.900
them as a steep drop.

00:31.900 --> 00:36.260
The fear of falling appears to be ingrained into the very fiber of our being.

00:36.260 --> 00:41.800
It's a sensation that's mutually understood by all, but somewhat difficult to articulate.

00:41.800 --> 00:45.980
Statistically speaking, you're about a hundred times more likely to die in a car accident

00:45.980 --> 00:52.100
than a plane crash, yet most of us undoubtedly find flying much more terrifying than driving.

00:52.100 --> 00:53.780
So why is this the case?

00:53.780 --> 00:56.900
Well for me, the answer lies in the element of control.

00:56.900 --> 01:00.860
If you're driving and something goes wrong, you at least feel like you have some input

01:00.860 --> 01:02.480
over your own destiny.

01:02.480 --> 01:07.380
If something goes wrong on a plane, well, you're just along for the ride.

01:07.380 --> 01:10.940
There's a certainty to falling that's impossible to deny.

01:10.940 --> 01:15.240
Once you step over the edge, you become nothing more than an object in motion.

01:15.240 --> 01:20.020
Your status, wealth, athleticism, intellect, none of it matters at that point.

01:20.020 --> 01:24.420
You have surrendered yourself to the complete mercy of nature and the unbreakable laws that

01:24.420 --> 01:25.820
govern it.

01:25.820 --> 01:30.080
In works of fiction, great falls are used to represent finality.

01:30.080 --> 01:33.580
Characters are often allowed to cheat death in all sorts of ways, but once you fall into

01:33.580 --> 01:36.260
the bottomless pit, it's game over.

01:36.260 --> 01:39.140
There's something so absolute about its outcome.

01:39.140 --> 01:42.260
To question it would be to question one's own sanity.

01:42.260 --> 01:46.980
Only a madman would intentionally step off the platform of unfathomable heights.

01:46.980 --> 01:51.560
And yet, in the visual cliff experiment, a few infants would crawl over the cliff completely

01:51.560 --> 01:52.660
unfazed.

01:52.660 --> 01:56.800
Possibly because they had not yet developed depth perception, but perhaps they grew up

01:56.800 --> 02:01.360
to be the very people who override billions of years of evolutionary programming to defy

02:01.360 --> 02:04.200
the most fundamental fear of man.

02:04.200 --> 02:07.300
This is the story of The World's Highest Jump.

02:16.980 --> 02:33.260
The jump I made here was about a meter, or around three feet in height.

02:33.260 --> 02:37.340
It's a jump I'm sure most of you would have no problem making as well, but how much higher

02:37.340 --> 02:41.200
could you go without hurting yourself in a basic jump like this?

02:41.200 --> 02:47.180
In Minecraft, a fall of four blocks or higher will make you take damage.

02:47.180 --> 02:52.500
A fall of 23 and a half blocks is fatal.

02:52.500 --> 02:57.960
In reality, the farthest you can safely fall onto a hard surface is around 10 to 12 feet.

02:57.960 --> 03:01.360
Higher than that and you're likely to walk away with minor injuries.

03:01.360 --> 03:06.120
When the Undertaker threw Mick Foley off the top of the cell at King of the Ring 98, Foley

03:06.120 --> 03:10.760
plummeted at least 16 feet, dislocating his shoulder in the process.

03:10.760 --> 03:15.200
A fall of 20 feet or higher will most likely result in serious injuries.

03:15.200 --> 03:19.440
And beyond 100 feet, a fall is considered unsurvivable.

03:19.440 --> 03:23.400
There's a common misconception that landing in water will break your fall, but due to

03:23.400 --> 03:27.800
surface tension, the only thing you'll be breaking is most of your bones.

03:27.800 --> 03:31.920
Landing in water from 100 feet is equivalent to landing on concrete.

03:31.920 --> 03:36.340
Surviving any fall greater than that is exceedingly rare without protective equipment.

03:36.340 --> 03:40.420
But for the vast majority of human history, all people had to brace themselves with their

03:40.420 --> 03:41.900
arms and legs.

03:41.900 --> 03:46.180
Naturally, this meant that any early attempts at the world's highest jump were almost certainly

03:46.180 --> 03:48.180
done so involuntarily.

03:48.180 --> 03:52.980
The first unsung record holders of this category may have earned their title by accident, by

03:52.980 --> 03:55.720
force, or by a failed attempt to end their life.

03:55.720 --> 04:00.320
But if someone in prehistoric times did want to make the jump of a lifetime, how far could

04:00.320 --> 04:01.660
they possibly fall?

04:01.660 --> 04:06.220
Well, in the age before aircraft, all people had to lift themselves was the terrain of

04:06.220 --> 04:07.580
the Earth itself.

04:07.820 --> 04:12.220
Mount Everest is the tallest point on Earth, but its slope would prematurely stop you long

04:12.220 --> 04:13.980
before you reach the bottom.

04:13.980 --> 04:18.300
For a continuous, uninterrupted fall, you would have to jump from the world's tallest

04:18.300 --> 04:19.300
cliff.

04:19.300 --> 04:25.180
For a purely vertical drop, Mount Thor in Canada has a prominence of over 4,100 feet.

04:25.180 --> 04:29.100
While highly unlikely, it's theoretically possible that somebody could have jumped from

04:29.100 --> 04:30.100
this height.

04:30.100 --> 04:34.340
However, in an age before written history, no one can say for sure.

04:34.340 --> 04:38.780
For the first recording of anyone jumping off anything, we have to venture closer to

04:38.780 --> 04:40.660
the stone mountains of China.

04:43.880 --> 04:46.540
As far as we know, this event may have never happened.

04:46.540 --> 04:50.900
The only information on it was written by a guy 2,000 years before our time, about a

04:50.900 --> 04:53.660
guy 2,000 years before his time.

04:53.660 --> 04:58.200
As the legend goes, Emperor Shun escaped the roof of a burning barn by gliding off using

04:58.200 --> 05:00.420
his hat to slow his descent.

05:00.420 --> 05:05.020
By my estimate, the jump was probably done from the equivalent of a two-story building,

05:05.020 --> 05:06.700
or about 20 feet.

05:06.700 --> 05:09.740
It may not sound like much, but this was significant.

05:09.740 --> 05:14.620
It's the earliest recorded instance of anyone jumping with intent rather than falling by

05:14.620 --> 05:15.980
mistake.

05:15.980 --> 05:20.920
All future jumps would be successors to Shun's 20-foot leap off the burning barn.

05:20.920 --> 05:25.820
The ancient Chinese were one of the first civilizations to experiment with aeronautics.

05:25.820 --> 05:31.740
As early as 200 BC, acrobats would use bamboo shoots to perform falling stunts at the Imperial

05:31.740 --> 05:32.800
Palace.

05:32.800 --> 05:37.520
By 500 AD, kites had become commonplace in Chinese society.

05:37.520 --> 05:41.700
Some kite designs had become aerodynamic enough to support the weight of a man.

05:41.700 --> 05:47.020
In 559, Yuan Huang-tou was one of several prisoners ordered to be executed by gliding

05:47.020 --> 05:49.740
off the 108-foot tall Phoenix Tower.

05:49.740 --> 05:54.820
Remarkably, Yuan survived, claiming the unofficial jump record in the process.

05:54.820 --> 05:57.980
For his achievement, Yuan was executed anyway.

05:57.980 --> 06:02.540
Despite his grim fate, the record would remain alive for more than a thousand years.

06:02.540 --> 06:07.100
The next great leap in aeronautical innovation came during the Italian Renaissance.

06:07.100 --> 06:11.540
Leonardo da Vinci is often credited with the invention of the parachute, but an even earlier

06:11.540 --> 06:16.100
concept can be traced back to 1470 from an anonymous manuscript.

06:16.100 --> 06:23.740
In 1615, Fausto Veranzio improved upon Leonardo's design, but so far, the parachute only existed

06:23.740 --> 06:24.740
in concept.

06:24.740 --> 06:29.220
It wasn't until the 18th century that the parachute was brought into reality.

06:29.220 --> 06:33.880
Louis Sebastian Lenerman would design and manufacture the first modern parachute.

06:33.880 --> 06:39.620
On December 26, 1783, Lenerman would record the first parachute jump in history by jumping

06:39.620 --> 06:43.180
from the upper balcony of the Montpellier Observatory.

06:43.180 --> 06:48.360
That very same year, just 120 miles away in Annonay, the Montgolfier brothers would develop

06:48.360 --> 06:50.140
the first hot air balloon.

06:50.140 --> 06:54.940
Within the span of a few months, mankind had not only broken free from Earth's terrain,

06:54.940 --> 06:58.240
but found a way to weaken the grip of gravity itself.

06:58.240 --> 07:05.660
And it was only a matter of time before someone would use both to make history.

07:05.660 --> 07:12.820
On October 22, 1797, Andre Garnerin became the first person to parachute out of an aircraft.

07:12.820 --> 07:17.900
Garnerin rose to 3,200 feet in a hot air balloon, then severed the basket, parachuting back

07:17.900 --> 07:19.580
down unharmed.

07:19.580 --> 07:23.860
You could argue that this wasn't a true jump, as Garnerin never actually stepped out

07:23.860 --> 07:25.560
of the balloon's basket.

07:25.560 --> 07:29.740
But based on the illustrations of the basket's design, I would say that it serves little

07:29.740 --> 07:34.620
purpose in actually protecting the user, and rather functions as a necessary component

07:34.620 --> 07:36.540
of the parachute itself.

07:36.540 --> 07:40.980
The important thing is that Andre Garnerin flew about 500 feet higher than the top of

07:40.980 --> 07:46.100
the Burj Khalifa, then severed his only means of flotation, placing full faith in the thin

07:46.100 --> 07:50.620
fabric above his head to ensure that he didn't wind up becoming a human crepe.

07:50.620 --> 07:56.140
On that day in 1797, Andre Garnerin became the first skydiver.

07:56.140 --> 08:00.060
Just five years later, he would set a new all-time record, jumping from a height of

08:00.060 --> 08:01.780
8,000 feet.

08:01.780 --> 08:06.280
Garnerin's aerial heroics would inspire a new generation of daredevils who would replicate

08:06.280 --> 08:09.740
his death-defying stunt in front of spectators around the world.

08:09.740 --> 08:14.560
19th century parachuters would draw crowds at local carnivals and other venues by dropping

08:14.560 --> 08:18.020
out of the sky from altitudes of 2 to 5,000 feet.

08:18.020 --> 08:22.520
This range is comparable to the cruising altitude of the Fortnite battle bus, and while the

08:22.520 --> 08:26.900
stunts looked death-defying, sometimes death would not be defied.

08:26.900 --> 08:32.560
In 1837, Robert Cocking earned the grim distinction of becoming the first skydiving fatality after

08:32.560 --> 08:35.460
his parachute failed at 5,000 feet.

08:35.460 --> 08:39.440
Cocking was supposedly attempting to reach the 8,000-foot mark that Garnerin had set

08:39.440 --> 08:43.240
decades prior, but the record would not be undone.

08:43.280 --> 08:47.360
The use of Cocking's death was a sobering reminder to the dangers of falling from thousands

08:47.360 --> 08:52.760
of feet in the air, and it extinguished the popularity of parachuting for decades afterwards.

08:52.760 --> 08:57.960
For the rest of the 1800s, there were no jump attempts on record surpassing Garnerin's

08:57.960 --> 08:59.260
8,000-foot mark.

08:59.260 --> 09:03.720
This was mostly due to the limitations of parachutes, as balloons continued to soar

09:03.720 --> 09:05.760
throughout the 19th century.

09:05.760 --> 09:10.280
Since would-be jumpers were no longer encumbered by the earth's terrain, the highest theoretical

09:10.320 --> 09:14.320
jump was now determined by the balloon altitude record.

09:19.960 --> 09:24.760
Even at this time, unmanned balloons could easily rise to tens of thousands of feet,

09:24.760 --> 09:29.040
but manned flights now had to deal with the limits of human physiology.

09:29.040 --> 09:34.980
Above 15,000 feet, most people will begin to suffer the effects of oxygen deprivation.

09:34.980 --> 09:39.360
Most modern-day skydiving excursions will not fly above this altitude for that very

09:39.360 --> 09:40.560
reason.

09:40.560 --> 09:45.940
Above 26,000 feet is the Death Zone, the limit beyond which the human body can no longer

09:45.940 --> 09:48.720
survive without supplemental oxygen.

09:48.720 --> 09:53.960
In 1862, James Glacier and Henry Cockswell became the first people to surpass the Death

09:53.960 --> 09:54.960
Zone.

09:54.960 --> 10:00.280
At around 29,000 feet, the pair lost consciousness, with Cockswell barely managing to pull the

10:00.280 --> 10:02.960
balloon's valve cord before blacking out.

10:02.960 --> 10:07.360
The pair survived when the balloon rapidly descended back to a safe height, but not before

10:07.360 --> 10:12.800
setting a new altitude record estimated between 29,000 and 37,000 feet.

10:12.800 --> 10:18.680
By 1887, oxygen tanks became commercially available, allowing ballooners to safely enter

10:18.680 --> 10:20.120
the Death Zone.

10:20.120 --> 10:25.960
In 1901, Arthur Burson and Reinhard Sühring set an official record of 35,000 feet in a

10:25.960 --> 10:30.200
hydrogen balloon, this time remaining conscious to record it.

10:30.200 --> 10:35.940
In 1927, Hawthorne Gray became the first person to pass the 40,000-foot mark, but perished

10:35.940 --> 10:37.860
after running out of oxygen.

10:37.860 --> 10:43.840
In 1931, August Picard and Paul Kipfer passed the 50,000-foot mark, becoming the first people

10:43.840 --> 10:47.860
to enter the stratosphere, as well as the first people to truly witness the curvature

10:47.860 --> 10:48.860
of the Earth.

10:48.860 --> 10:53.680
In 1933, at the Century of Progress World Fair, Thomas Settle and Chester Fordney would

10:53.680 --> 10:55.800
surpass 60,000 feet.

10:55.800 --> 10:59.620
By this point, record attempts were quickly approaching the next hard limit in manned

10:59.620 --> 11:01.120
balloon flights.

11:01.120 --> 11:06.760
As altitude increases, air pressure decreases, as does the boiling point of fluids.

11:06.760 --> 11:11.200
At around 60,000 feet, air pressure is low enough where the temperature of your body

11:11.200 --> 11:16.400
will exceed the boiling point of water, causing your blood to literally boil.

11:16.400 --> 11:20.860
This limit is otherwise known as the Armstrong Line, and future flights above it would require

11:20.860 --> 11:22.740
a pressurized suit.

11:22.740 --> 11:27.860
In 1934, the Soviet Union's Osevayikin-1 surpassed the Armstrong Line and reached a

11:27.860 --> 11:33.320
peak altitude of 72,000 feet before the balloon disintegrated during its descent, killing

11:33.320 --> 11:35.060
all three crew members.

11:35.060 --> 11:39.440
One year later, in what would be a precursor to the Space Race, the United States took

11:39.440 --> 11:45.340
back the record when Albert Stevens and Orville Anderson reached 72,400 feet in the Explorer

11:45.340 --> 11:46.540
II craft.

11:46.540 --> 11:50.300
By this point, balloon flight progression had provided the jump record with massive

11:50.300 --> 11:54.860
potential for improvement, but before anyone could attempt a new record, the parachute

11:54.860 --> 12:03.160
would have to rise to the occasion.

12:03.160 --> 12:07.580
The turn of the 20th century saw two tremendous strides in aeronautics, with the invention

12:07.580 --> 12:09.860
of the airplane and the airship.

12:09.860 --> 12:14.220
The unprecedented boom in air travel renewed interest in the parachute.

12:14.220 --> 12:19.420
In 1907, aerial stuntman Charles Brodwick would provide the first major parachute innovation

12:19.420 --> 12:23.620
with a static line, which allowed the chute to automatically deploy when jumping out of

12:23.620 --> 12:25.040
an aircraft.

12:25.040 --> 12:29.940
In 1914, Brodwick's adopted daughter Tiny became the first person to manually deploy

12:29.940 --> 12:34.580
a chute while in freefall, eventually leading to the invention of the ripcord.

12:34.580 --> 12:40.500
And starting in 1919, Leslie Ervin began manufacturing and distributing the Type A parachute for

12:40.500 --> 12:43.100
use as life preservers on airplanes.

12:43.100 --> 12:47.120
The Ervin chute would revitalize the pastime of stunt jumping.

12:47.120 --> 12:51.540
Just as the balloon jumpers would perform death-defying jumps a century earlier, a new

12:51.540 --> 12:57.540
generation of aerial acrobats would wow spectators by jumping from the cockpits of their airplanes.

12:57.540 --> 13:02.060
This new wave of daredevils became known as the Barnstormers, the most famous of which

13:02.060 --> 13:05.020
was a man by the name of Charles Lindbergh.

13:05.020 --> 13:09.320
Lindbergh was most known for making the first non-stop transatlantic flight, but buried

13:09.320 --> 13:13.860
among his long list of aviation accomplishments was the new record for the world's highest

13:13.860 --> 13:14.860
jump.

13:14.860 --> 13:20.220
In 1926, Lindbergh used an Ervin chute to bail out of his plane at an altitude of 13,000

13:20.220 --> 13:24.300
feet, finally breaking Garnerin's record after more than a century.

13:24.300 --> 13:29.820
1927 saw the first tests of parachutes in military combat, leading to the rise of the

13:29.820 --> 13:30.820
paratrooper.

13:30.820 --> 13:36.380
In 1943, U.S. Army surgeon Randy Lovelace became the first person on record to jump

13:36.380 --> 13:37.860
from the stratosphere.

13:37.860 --> 13:43.240
In an Air Force experiment, Lovelace bailed out of an army bomber at over 40,000 feet.

13:43.240 --> 13:47.740
The force of the parachute knocked him unconscious, and the minus 40 degree temperatures left

13:47.740 --> 13:49.300
his hands frostbitten.

13:49.300 --> 13:53.900
But Lovelace survived the jump by the skin of his teeth, claiming the record in the process.

13:53.900 --> 13:58.420
The first ever jump from the stratosphere would be the last with a conventional parachute,

13:58.420 --> 14:00.400
at least in the United States.

14:00.400 --> 14:05.280
Soviet jumpers Vasily Romanuk and Nikolai Nikitin would both set higher marks, with

14:05.280 --> 14:09.800
Nikitin surpassing 47,000 feet in 1957.

14:09.800 --> 14:15.300
While the Russians were fixated on the record itself, the U.S. directed their focus to survival.

14:15.300 --> 14:19.580
If pilots were to survive ejecting at very high altitudes, they would need to be equipped

14:19.580 --> 14:22.220
with parachutes fit for the edge of space.

14:22.220 --> 14:27.420
Randy Lovelace's near-fatal jump would usher in a new era, the dawn of the space jump.

14:35.420 --> 14:37.020
I'm going to jump!

14:37.020 --> 14:38.020
No!

14:38.020 --> 14:41.020
Do a flip!

14:41.020 --> 14:47.780
Patients of YouTube, it is I, Dr. Spiral, standing here atop this three-story structure.

14:47.780 --> 14:53.260
Now in my medical opinion, I would say that it's unsafe to fall from this height.

14:53.260 --> 14:56.380
I mean, a fall from this height can make your hair fall out.

14:56.380 --> 14:59.980
Skydivers can fall faster than 120 miles per hour.

14:59.980 --> 15:02.860
In those conditions, your hair won't last long.

15:02.860 --> 15:06.860
That's why if you're planning to jump off anything, I recommend using Keeps Hair Loss

15:06.860 --> 15:08.540
Prevention first.

15:08.540 --> 15:13.020
Keeps is the most affordable FDA-approved hair loss product, and you can visit an online

15:13.020 --> 15:16.540
doctor right now to get your medication shipped right to your door.

15:16.540 --> 15:22.260
Now, to demonstrate Keeps' 90% effectiveness at treating and reducing the symptoms of hair

15:22.260 --> 15:26.540
loss, I will jump off this three-story structure right now!

15:30.540 --> 15:31.540
Oh!

15:31.540 --> 15:32.540
Oh!

15:32.540 --> 15:33.540
Oh my gosh!

15:33.540 --> 15:34.540
Wow!

15:34.540 --> 15:37.220
I really just fell from all the way up there!

15:37.220 --> 15:39.220
Keeps kept my hair safe!

15:39.220 --> 15:40.540
My hair...

15:40.540 --> 15:43.520
It's game over for hair loss!

15:56.260 --> 16:01.300
Scientifically speaking, outer space doesn't begin until the Karman line, more than 300,000

16:01.300 --> 16:02.300
feet high.

16:02.300 --> 16:07.660
The region between it and the Armstrong line is classified as near space, and as jet planes

16:07.660 --> 16:13.180
flew higher, pilots would need a new kind of parachute to safely eject from this range.

16:13.180 --> 16:18.500
Following Randy Loveless' near-fatal jump, the Air Force began testing experimental high-altitude

16:18.500 --> 16:20.420
parachutes on dummies.

16:20.420 --> 16:24.100
Early designs would force the dummies into an uncontrollable flat spin that would be

16:24.100 --> 16:26.780
potentially fatal on human subjects.

16:26.780 --> 16:31.940
By 1958, they were ready to test out a new multi-stage design that was intended to stabilize

16:31.940 --> 16:33.220
the jumper.

16:33.220 --> 16:38.580
Only this time, the test would be conducted on a human being, an unenviable task bestowed

16:38.580 --> 16:40.780
upon Captain Joseph Kittinger.

16:46.300 --> 16:50.080
Kittinger had already proven himself as the Air Force's new favorite guinea pig with

16:50.080 --> 16:56.440
his role in Project Manhigh, a 1957 research assignment that saw Kittinger soar 96,000

16:56.440 --> 17:00.460
feet in a balloon, setting a new altitude record in the process.

17:00.500 --> 17:05.200
His next assignment would be Project Excelsior, where Kittinger would once again rise to the

17:05.200 --> 17:09.500
stratosphere in a balloon, only this time he would have to jump out.

17:09.500 --> 17:15.960
On November 16, 1959, Kittinger fastened his pressure suit and boarded Excelsior 1, rising

17:15.960 --> 17:19.400
to an altitude of 76,400 feet.

17:19.400 --> 17:24.660
At that point, Kittinger unstrapped himself from the gondola and stepped over the edge.

17:24.660 --> 17:26.580
Immediately there was a problem.

17:26.580 --> 17:30.060
Kittinger had prematurely deployed his stabilization chute.

17:30.060 --> 17:33.760
Just like the test dummies, Kittinger entered an uncontrollable spin.

17:33.760 --> 17:39.200
At 120 rpm, Kittinger blacked out nearly 13 miles above the Earth.

17:39.200 --> 17:42.700
He regained consciousness just 3,000 feet from the ground.

17:42.700 --> 17:47.220
Miraculously, the rest of the chutes functioned according to plan, allowing Joe Kittinger

17:47.220 --> 17:50.340
to escape with his life and a new record.

17:50.340 --> 17:54.380
Despite a near disaster on the first run, Kittinger was determined to prove that the

17:54.380 --> 17:56.540
new parachute system could work.

17:56.540 --> 18:01.540
Less than a month later, Kittinger would return to the skies with Excelsior 2, jumping from

18:01.540 --> 18:03.300
74,000 feet.

18:03.300 --> 18:07.540
This time the parachutes functioned flawlessly, and although he was just shy of adding to

18:07.540 --> 18:12.380
the record, he would get one more chance to make history in the summer of 1960.

18:12.380 --> 18:17.260
On the morning of August 16, Kittinger boarded the gondola for Excelsior 3.

18:17.260 --> 18:21.380
Sudden cloud cover almost canceled the mission before it started, but Kittinger launched

18:21.380 --> 18:24.740
just one minute before the orders to cancel the flight.

18:24.740 --> 18:28.680
Soon after, overcast skies would be the least of his concerns.

18:28.680 --> 18:33.900
At about 50,000 feet, Kittinger realized that his right glove had failed to pressurize,

18:33.900 --> 18:36.780
causing his hand to swell to twice its size.

18:36.780 --> 18:41.980
Despite the potentially catastrophic complication, Kittinger did not inform the ground crew.

18:41.980 --> 18:45.620
He knew that if he did, the mission would be immediately aborted.

18:45.620 --> 18:49.660
Anticipating that they would never get another chance at a jump, Kittinger bit the bullet

18:49.660 --> 18:51.560
and continued to rise.

18:51.560 --> 18:56.300
About one hour and forty minutes after launch, Kittinger took the highest step in the world,

18:56.300 --> 18:59.020
and jumped from the stratosphere for the final time.

18:59.020 --> 19:02.780
Kittinger free-filled for four and a half minutes before deploying his main chute.

19:02.780 --> 19:06.140
He reached a top speed of 614 miles per hour.

19:06.140 --> 19:10.300
Thirteen minutes and forty-five seconds after stepping out of the gondola, Joe Kittinger

19:10.300 --> 19:12.920
touched down in the New Mexico desert.

19:12.920 --> 19:14.920
The ground crew was ecstatic.

19:14.920 --> 19:19.540
Not only was Excelsior 3 a resounding success, but Kittinger had just landed from the highest

19:19.740 --> 19:21.260
jump in history.

19:21.260 --> 19:23.260
So just how high did Joe go?

19:44.260 --> 19:47.320
102,800 feet.

19:47.320 --> 19:52.000
Not only did Joe Kittinger set the all-time jump record, he did so while setting the all-time

19:52.000 --> 19:57.780
balloon altitude record, the second highest altitude ever reached by man at that point.

19:57.780 --> 20:02.440
After proving that humans could survive exposure to the upper atmosphere, Project Excelsior

20:02.440 --> 20:05.840
would open the floodgates for manned space exploration.

20:05.840 --> 20:10.460
Soon after, both the US and Soviet Union would send the first astronauts into orbit.

20:10.460 --> 20:13.780
But in that moment, Kittinger stood farther from the Earth's surface than all but a

20:13.780 --> 20:17.580
single person before him, and then jumped back down.

20:17.580 --> 20:21.980
Years later while serving in Vietnam, Kittinger would be captured as a prisoner of war after

20:21.980 --> 20:23.920
his plane was shot down.

20:23.920 --> 20:26.420
One has to wonder which moment was more terrifying.

20:30.420 --> 20:35.460
Remarkably, despite accomplishing one of the most impressive feats in the history of aviation,

20:35.460 --> 20:37.720
Kittinger never actually cared about the record.

20:37.720 --> 20:42.100
He took far more satisfaction in completing the mission and validating the effectiveness

20:42.100 --> 20:43.980
of the high altitude parachute.

20:43.980 --> 20:47.420
Ironically, the record would go on to define his legacy.

20:47.420 --> 20:52.380
Before Joe Kittinger, the jump record only existed as a formality, a sloppy and poorly

20:52.380 --> 20:56.700
documented patchwork of events consisting mostly of people who stumbled into the record

20:56.700 --> 20:58.780
completely unintentionally.

20:58.780 --> 21:03.620
In many ways, Kittinger was no different, but after Excelsior, the record would never

21:03.620 --> 21:04.620
be the same.

21:04.620 --> 21:09.260
It was the first time that the world's highest jump was documented, broadcasted, and celebrated

21:09.260 --> 21:10.660
in the media.

21:10.720 --> 21:15.520
Kittinger had effectively made the record tangible, and before long, a new wave of contenders

21:15.520 --> 21:17.020
were lining up to break it.

21:21.020 --> 21:25.420
Naturally, the first people to challenge for the American record were the Russians.

21:25.420 --> 21:30.640
In 1962, Pyotr Dolgov and Yevgeny Andreyev were tasked with the Soviet Union's first

21:30.640 --> 21:32.660
attempt at a space jump.

21:32.660 --> 21:38.900
Andreyev successfully jumped from 83,000 feet, setting a new record for the longest freefall.

21:38.900 --> 21:44.540
Dolgov jumped from nearly 94,000 feet, but perished after his suit depressurized.

21:44.540 --> 21:49.460
Dolgov's death would be covered up for years, but as far as the Soviets were concerned,

21:49.460 --> 21:51.660
the mission was a success.

21:51.660 --> 21:56.300
Even though Joe Kittinger's record was well documented and precisely measured with state-of-the-art

21:56.300 --> 22:01.820
technology, it wasn't verified by the FAI, allowing the Soviets to claim the official

22:01.820 --> 22:05.100
record despite falling nearly 20,000 feet short.

22:05.100 --> 22:09.420
For all intents and purposes, Joe Kittinger still held the record, but the Soviets had

22:09.420 --> 22:13.740
the validation of a bureaucratic sanctioning body in Switzerland, and they were content

22:13.740 --> 22:14.860
with that.

22:14.860 --> 22:19.020
Not content with the disputed title was a young adventurer from New Jersey, Nicholas

22:19.020 --> 22:20.100
Piantanita.

22:24.340 --> 22:28.260
The young skydiver had been obsessed with jumping ever since his childhood, where he

22:28.260 --> 22:32.100
would nearly fall to his death after jumping from the roof of his apartment with a makeshift

22:32.100 --> 22:34.340
parachute made from his bedsheets.

22:34.340 --> 22:39.500
By the 60s, Piantanita was determined to bring the undisputed record back to America by making

22:39.500 --> 22:41.460
the greatest jump in history.

22:41.460 --> 22:45.700
His goal was to break both Kittinger's altitude record and Andreyev's freefall record in

22:45.700 --> 22:48.740
what would become known as Project Stratojump.

22:48.740 --> 22:53.440
But unlike the space jumpers before him, Piantanita didn't have government backing.

22:53.440 --> 22:58.300
He had to essentially create his own ragtag aeronautical research program from scratch,

22:58.300 --> 23:01.740
using sponsors, volunteers, and borrowed facilities.

23:01.740 --> 23:06.940
While preparing for the jump, Piantanita sought out consultation from Joe Kittinger himself.

23:06.940 --> 23:10.580
Kittinger, never a fan of chasing records, refused.

23:10.580 --> 23:14.660
He had nearly lost his life performing the feat just a few years prior, and he didn't

23:14.660 --> 23:19.060
appreciate Piantanita's cavalier attitude towards the daunting challenge.

23:19.060 --> 23:23.900
However, despite his barebones resources, Piantanita and the Strat-O team managed to

23:23.900 --> 23:27.540
assemble a working balloon, gondola, and pressure suit.

23:27.540 --> 23:33.060
By the autumn of 1965, Nick Piantanita was ready to take to the skies.

23:33.060 --> 23:38.940
On October 22, Stratojump 1 lifted off from a field outside of St. Paul, Minnesota.

23:38.940 --> 23:43.880
Unfortunately, high wind shear would destroy the balloon at just 16,000 feet, forcing an

23:43.880 --> 23:46.560
emergency landing and a second attempt.

23:46.560 --> 23:50.380
He would try again on February 2, 1966.

23:50.380 --> 23:54.540
This time, the balloon had no problem reaching the stratosphere where it continued rising.

23:54.540 --> 24:02.140
Soon, it had soared past Andreyev's mark of 80,000, then past Kittinger's mark of 102,000.

24:02.140 --> 24:08.220
Piantanita's balloon topped out at an unprecedented height of 123,500 feet.

24:08.220 --> 24:10.920
His unyielding hubris was about to pay off.

24:10.920 --> 24:13.480
The record was tantalizingly close.

24:13.480 --> 24:22.800
All Nick Piantanita had to do was step out of the gondola and into the record books.

24:22.800 --> 24:24.260
But there was a problem.

24:24.260 --> 24:28.940
The oxygen line tethering Piantanita to the gondola wouldn't detach, and he had no way

24:28.940 --> 24:30.860
of severing the connection.

24:30.860 --> 24:35.440
After several agonizing minutes at the edge of glory, the ground crew decided to abort

24:35.440 --> 24:36.580
the mission.

24:36.580 --> 24:42.480
In a turbulent and dangerous descent, a battered Piantanita returned to Earth with the gondola.

24:42.480 --> 24:46.560
After the heartbreaking failure, Piantanita would not be deterred.

24:46.560 --> 24:53.180
On May 1, 1966, he stepped back into the gondola with the goal of once again reaching the 120,000

24:53.180 --> 24:54.300
foot mark.

24:54.300 --> 25:05.820
This time, he would pay the ultimate price.

25:05.820 --> 25:10.320
At 57,000 feet, Nick Piantanita's suit depressurized.

25:10.320 --> 25:15.700
The ground crew immediately aborted the mission, but at that point, very little could be done.

25:15.700 --> 25:20.500
Piantanita was starved of oxygen for more than 20 minutes, falling into a coma from

25:20.500 --> 25:22.340
which he never recovered.

25:22.340 --> 25:27.080
As close as he came to proving everyone wrong, Piantanita's recklessness would ultimately

25:27.080 --> 25:28.620
cost him everything.

25:28.620 --> 25:33.800
He met a cruelly fitting fate, spending his final moments in the sky, the place he always

25:33.800 --> 25:38.640
seemed to belong.

25:38.640 --> 25:43.100
The stratojump catastrophe would mark the end of record attempts for a while.

25:43.100 --> 25:48.260
Neither of the two world superpowers were interested in balloon jump escapades anymore.

25:48.260 --> 25:51.200
They had moved on to new frontiers.

25:51.200 --> 25:55.400
Later record holders would have to independently direct their own operations.

25:55.400 --> 26:00.020
After progressing through millennia of physical barriers to the sky, the newest limitations

26:00.020 --> 26:03.420
to the jump record were now cost and ambition.

26:03.420 --> 26:08.400
The 60s had quickly become the age of the astronaut, and the boom in space exploration

26:08.400 --> 26:12.400
had taken much of the luster off the once vaunted space jump.

26:12.400 --> 26:16.900
It seemed that the only notable jumps of this era happened by complete chance.

26:16.900 --> 26:22.940
In 1966, American pilot Bill Weaver would survive a 78,000 foot fall after ejecting

26:22.940 --> 26:24.960
from a jet at Mach 3.

26:24.960 --> 26:29.040
His life would be spared thanks to the same parachute design that Joe Kittinger had tested

26:29.040 --> 26:31.020
just six years prior.

26:31.020 --> 26:37.800
In 1971, DB Cooper became the first and only person to successfully commit airplane piracy,

26:37.800 --> 26:42.340
parachuting an estimated 10,000 feet with $200,000 in ransom money.

26:42.340 --> 26:47.860
In 1973, Serbian flight attendant Vensa Vulovic survived the highest fall on record without

26:47.860 --> 26:52.580
a parachute after the plane she was servicing exploded at 33,000 feet.

26:52.580 --> 26:58.300
And in 1982, Larry Walter survived an ascent to 16,000 feet after tying dozens of weather

26:58.300 --> 27:00.220
balloons to a lawn chair.

27:00.220 --> 27:04.700
The next attempt at the world's highest jump wouldn't happen until the 90s with decorated

27:04.700 --> 27:07.240
British paratrooper Nish Bruce.

27:07.240 --> 27:11.740
Starting in the early 90s, Bruce began training for the eventual Skydive from Space project

27:11.740 --> 27:15.260
where he would make a planned jump from 130,000 feet.

27:15.260 --> 27:19.700
The project was partially funded by NASA, who wanted to test the effects of radiation

27:19.700 --> 27:21.420
at high altitudes.

27:21.420 --> 27:26.580
Despite an encouraging start, the project would abruptly end in 1994 when Bruce suffered

27:26.580 --> 27:31.120
an unexpected mental breakdown, stabbing his girlfriend with a pair of scissors.

27:31.120 --> 27:35.300
The incident would mark the beginning of Bruce's eight-year-long battle with mental illness,

27:35.300 --> 27:37.900
a battle he would eventually lose.

27:37.900 --> 27:42.320
In 2002, Nish Bruce would end his life by intentionally jumping from a plane without

27:42.320 --> 27:43.740
a parachute.

27:43.740 --> 27:48.780
Much like Nick Piantanita, Nish Bruce was someone who seemed to belong to the sky, this

27:48.780 --> 28:00.380
time going out on his own terms.

28:00.380 --> 28:05.380
After four decades of magnificent failure since Project Excelsior, the new millennium

28:05.380 --> 28:09.100
would bring a new wave of contenders trying to beat the record.

28:09.100 --> 28:14.260
Starting in 2000, Cheryl Stearns would announce her plans to jump from 130,000 feet with the

28:14.260 --> 28:16.980
formation of the StratoQuest project.

28:16.980 --> 28:22.060
Stearns was the most accomplished female skydiver in history and was prepared to make the ultimate

28:22.060 --> 28:24.460
jump in the spring of 2001.

28:24.460 --> 28:28.620
Unfortunately, StratoQuest could never quite materialize.

28:28.620 --> 28:33.220
After numerous delays and funding issues, the project had fallen defunct by the end of

28:33.220 --> 28:34.220
the 2000s.

28:34.620 --> 28:39.860
An Australian man, Rod Milner, announced that next March, he plans to skydive from 25 miles

28:39.860 --> 28:45.260
above the Earth, reaching speeds over a thousand miles an hour and breaking the sound barrier.

28:45.260 --> 28:50.580
In 2001, Australian skydiver Rod Milner would make waves in the media by announcing his

28:50.580 --> 28:55.340
plan to jump from 130,000 feet and break the sound barrier with his fall.

28:55.340 --> 29:00.260
The mission, titled Project Space Jump, had reportedly secured funding from the Australian

29:00.260 --> 29:04.900
Defence Force Academy with plans to launch a year later in March 2002.

29:04.900 --> 29:09.540
Well, a year came and went and no jump was ever attempted.

29:09.540 --> 29:14.420
Following the initial media hype, Project Space Jump was never discussed again and eventually

29:14.420 --> 29:19.620
forgotten, coming off much more like a publicity stunt than an actual attempt at the record.

29:19.620 --> 29:25.300
In 2003, French adventurer Michel Fournier announced Les Grand Sau, during which he planned

29:25.300 --> 29:27.900
to jump from 130,000 feet.

29:27.900 --> 29:32.140
Fournier made the most progress of anyone in the decade, managing to produce a working

29:32.140 --> 29:34.420
balloon, pressure suit, and gondola.

29:34.420 --> 29:39.620
Unfortunately, all of Fournier's attempts would be aborted before they could even launch.

29:39.620 --> 29:44.380
After spending two decades and nearly 20 million dollars chasing the record, Michel Fournier

29:44.380 --> 29:46.420
couldn't even get off the ground.

29:46.420 --> 29:51.180
2010 would mark the 50-year anniversary of Joe Kittinger's record, and after half a

29:51.180 --> 29:55.300
century of failure, many began to wonder whether anyone could break it.

29:58.900 --> 30:04.100
Starting in 2010, Red Bull would sponsor the Stratos project and team up with Austrian

30:04.100 --> 30:09.020
skydiver Felix Baumgartner to finally top Kittinger's record once and for all.

30:09.020 --> 30:12.940
Preparing Felix for the jump would be none other than Joe Kittinger himself.

30:12.940 --> 30:17.300
Kittinger's blessings seemed to ward off the demons that had plagued all other attempts

30:17.300 --> 30:18.940
since he set the record.

30:18.940 --> 30:23.540
In March 2012, Baumgartner would successfully complete the project's first test jump from

30:23.540 --> 30:25.220
71,000 feet.

30:25.220 --> 30:30.300
In July, he would complete the second test jump, this time from 96,000 feet.

30:30.300 --> 30:36.100
And finally, on October 14, 2012, Felix Baumgartner was ready to make history in a moment streamed

30:36.100 --> 30:38.100
live around the world.

30:55.220 --> 31:13.420
After finally having his record broken, Joe Kittinger never looked happier.

31:13.420 --> 31:18.620
After 52 years of frustration, there was finally a new record holder of the world's highest

31:18.620 --> 31:19.620
jump.

31:19.620 --> 31:23.260
In addition to setting the altitude record, Felix Baumgartner became the first jumper

31:23.260 --> 31:27.300
in history to break the sound barrier in his freefall, as well as setting the record

31:27.300 --> 31:29.860
for the longest distance in freefall.

31:29.860 --> 31:34.660
The YouTube livestream was watched by nearly 10 million viewers, a record that itself would

31:34.660 --> 31:36.740
stand for almost six years.

31:36.740 --> 31:41.700
The new record provided a rare moment of inspiration for a generation who had very little to celebrate

31:41.700 --> 31:43.780
in terms of aeronautical achievement.

31:43.780 --> 31:46.680
Truly, it was a jump for the ages.

31:46.680 --> 31:51.500
After taking half a century to be Kittinger's mark of 102,000, who knew how long it would

31:51.500 --> 31:58.720
take to beat Baumgartner, the record would stand for two years.

31:58.720 --> 32:04.860
On October 24, 2014, computer scientist Alan Eustace would set a new altitude record of

32:04.860 --> 32:08.180
135,889 feet.

32:08.180 --> 32:13.300
Eustace worked as the senior VP of engineering at Google and had no prior history of skydiving

32:13.300 --> 32:14.940
or extreme stunts.

32:14.940 --> 32:19.300
One day he decided that he wanted to pursue the record, so he assembled a team of collaborators

32:19.300 --> 32:20.900
to form Stratex.

32:20.900 --> 32:25.500
Eustace became the first jumper in history to ascend to the stratosphere without a gondola,

32:25.500 --> 32:29.700
relying only on a pressure suit to protect him from the vacuum of near space.

32:29.700 --> 32:34.180
The reduction in weight allowed him to soar more than 8,000 feet higher than Baumgartner's

32:34.180 --> 32:35.180
mark.

32:35.180 --> 32:39.300
In just a single attempt at the record, Alan Eustace went up and got it.

32:39.300 --> 32:42.460
That's where the record stands today, but where does it go from here?

32:42.460 --> 32:48.060
Well, the record for the highest unmanned balloon flight is 173,900 feet.

32:48.180 --> 32:52.660
Fighter weight missions like Stratex may approach this altitude, but sooner or later, jumpers

32:52.660 --> 32:56.220
will reach another hard limit, the mesosphere.

32:56.220 --> 33:01.500
Starting at around 170,000 feet, the air becomes thin enough to force any balloon to burst

33:01.500 --> 33:03.260
from the pressure difference.

33:03.260 --> 33:08.180
As a result, the mesosphere is the least explored part of the atmosphere, extending too high

33:08.180 --> 33:11.140
for balloons and too low for satellites.

33:11.140 --> 33:15.420
But what if you were to skip the mesosphere entirely and jump from a satellite?

33:15.420 --> 33:19.540
The International Space Station orbits in the thermosphere at an average altitude of

33:19.540 --> 33:24.540
about 1.3 million feet, nearly 10 times the height of the current record.

33:24.540 --> 33:29.660
However, since the ISS is in orbit, it's traveling about 10 times faster than an average

33:29.660 --> 33:30.740
bullet.

33:30.740 --> 33:35.580
Re-entering the atmosphere at that speed will cause the human body to burn up like a meteor.

33:35.580 --> 33:39.860
Currently, the best hope for space jumps beyond the stratosphere may be Virgin Galactic's

33:39.860 --> 33:45.740
SpaceShipTwo, a suborbital space plane capable of surpassing the 300,000-foot mark.

33:45.740 --> 33:50.260
Due to the parabolic shape of the flight path, it could be theoretically possible to jump

33:50.260 --> 33:53.100
from the peak without extreme exit velocity.

33:53.100 --> 33:57.800
Virgin Galactic plans to launch commercial flights on the space plane starting this decade,

33:57.800 --> 34:02.620
so it's possible that the next great stride in space jumping may be just a few years away.

34:02.620 --> 34:06.580
For now, the record stands at just under 136,000 feet.

34:06.580 --> 34:11.280
No matter the era, death-defying jumps have never failed to amaze and inspire those who

34:11.280 --> 34:12.660
witness them.

34:12.660 --> 34:20.540
Space jumping is both a product and an example of our endless thirst for progress.

34:20.540 --> 34:25.660
Sixty years ago as Joe Kittinger gazed down at the Earth prior to his record-setting jump,

34:25.660 --> 34:30.060
he remarked at the irony of such beauty existing in such deadly conditions.

34:30.060 --> 34:34.860
He compared floating through the stratosphere to being enveloped in an ocean of cyanide.

34:34.860 --> 34:39.500
Despite literally being on top of the world, Kittinger was overcome with an overwhelming

34:39.500 --> 34:44.340
sense of humility.

34:44.340 --> 34:50.160
We defy nature by venturing higher and higher, and nature humbles us with its unconquerable

34:50.160 --> 34:51.620
vastness.

34:51.620 --> 34:56.800
After 4,000 years of trying, we have already managed to jump from unfathomable heights,

34:56.800 --> 34:59.260
but we still have so much farther to go.

34:59.260 --> 35:02.500
For the future of the world's highest jump, the sky's the limit.

35:29.260 --> 35:39.940
Thanks for watching!
