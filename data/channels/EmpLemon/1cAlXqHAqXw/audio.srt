1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:13,100
What's the highest you've ever jumped?

2
00:00:13,100 --> 00:00:17,140
For most of us, that number never exceeds more than a few feet, for the simple reason

3
00:00:17,140 --> 00:00:19,980
that jumping off anything higher is terrifying.

4
00:00:19,980 --> 00:00:25,620
Bazophobia, or the fear of falling, is a phobia inherent to humans and many species of animals.

5
00:00:25,620 --> 00:00:30,060
In the visual cliff experiment, a vast majority of infants would not cross what appeared to

6
00:00:30,060 --> 00:00:31,900
them as a steep drop.

7
00:00:31,900 --> 00:00:36,260
The fear of falling appears to be ingrained into the very fiber of our being.

8
00:00:36,260 --> 00:00:41,800
It's a sensation that's mutually understood by all, but somewhat difficult to articulate.

9
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:45,980
Statistically speaking, you're about a hundred times more likely to die in a car accident

10
00:00:45,980 --> 00:00:52,100
than a plane crash, yet most of us undoubtedly find flying much more terrifying than driving.

11
00:00:52,100 --> 00:00:53,780
So why is this the case?

12
00:00:53,780 --> 00:00:56,900
Well for me, the answer lies in the element of control.

13
00:00:56,900 --> 00:01:00,860
If you're driving and something goes wrong, you at least feel like you have some input

14
00:01:00,860 --> 00:01:02,480
over your own destiny.

15
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:07,380
If something goes wrong on a plane, well, you're just along for the ride.

16
00:01:07,380 --> 00:01:10,940
There's a certainty to falling that's impossible to deny.

17
00:01:10,940 --> 00:01:15,240
Once you step over the edge, you become nothing more than an object in motion.

18
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:20,020
Your status, wealth, athleticism, intellect, none of it matters at that point.

19
00:01:20,020 --> 00:01:24,420
You have surrendered yourself to the complete mercy of nature and the unbreakable laws that

20
00:01:24,420 --> 00:01:25,820
govern it.

21
00:01:25,820 --> 00:01:30,080
In works of fiction, great falls are used to represent finality.

22
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:33,580
Characters are often allowed to cheat death in all sorts of ways, but once you fall into

23
00:01:33,580 --> 00:01:36,260
the bottomless pit, it's game over.

24
00:01:36,260 --> 00:01:39,140
There's something so absolute about its outcome.

25
00:01:39,140 --> 00:01:42,260
To question it would be to question one's own sanity.

26
00:01:42,260 --> 00:01:46,980
Only a madman would intentionally step off the platform of unfathomable heights.

27
00:01:46,980 --> 00:01:51,560
And yet, in the visual cliff experiment, a few infants would crawl over the cliff completely

28
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:52,660
unfazed.

29
00:01:52,660 --> 00:01:56,800
Possibly because they had not yet developed depth perception, but perhaps they grew up

30
00:01:56,800 --> 00:02:01,360
to be the very people who override billions of years of evolutionary programming to defy

31
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:04,200
the most fundamental fear of man.

32
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:07,300
This is the story of The World's Highest Jump.

33
00:02:16,980 --> 00:02:33,260
The jump I made here was about a meter, or around three feet in height.

34
00:02:33,260 --> 00:02:37,340
It's a jump I'm sure most of you would have no problem making as well, but how much higher

35
00:02:37,340 --> 00:02:41,200
could you go without hurting yourself in a basic jump like this?

36
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:47,180
In Minecraft, a fall of four blocks or higher will make you take damage.

37
00:02:47,180 --> 00:02:52,500
A fall of 23 and a half blocks is fatal.

38
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:57,960
In reality, the farthest you can safely fall onto a hard surface is around 10 to 12 feet.

39
00:02:57,960 --> 00:03:01,360
Higher than that and you're likely to walk away with minor injuries.

40
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:06,120
When the Undertaker threw Mick Foley off the top of the cell at King of the Ring 98, Foley

41
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:10,760
plummeted at least 16 feet, dislocating his shoulder in the process.

42
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:15,200
A fall of 20 feet or higher will most likely result in serious injuries.

43
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:19,440
And beyond 100 feet, a fall is considered unsurvivable.

44
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:23,400
There's a common misconception that landing in water will break your fall, but due to

45
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:27,800
surface tension, the only thing you'll be breaking is most of your bones.

46
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:31,920
Landing in water from 100 feet is equivalent to landing on concrete.

47
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:36,340
Surviving any fall greater than that is exceedingly rare without protective equipment.

48
00:03:36,340 --> 00:03:40,420
But for the vast majority of human history, all people had to brace themselves with their

49
00:03:40,420 --> 00:03:41,900
arms and legs.

50
00:03:41,900 --> 00:03:46,180
Naturally, this meant that any early attempts at the world's highest jump were almost certainly

51
00:03:46,180 --> 00:03:48,180
done so involuntarily.

52
00:03:48,180 --> 00:03:52,980
The first unsung record holders of this category may have earned their title by accident, by

53
00:03:52,980 --> 00:03:55,720
force, or by a failed attempt to end their life.

54
00:03:55,720 --> 00:04:00,320
But if someone in prehistoric times did want to make the jump of a lifetime, how far could

55
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:01,660
they possibly fall?

56
00:04:01,660 --> 00:04:06,220
Well, in the age before aircraft, all people had to lift themselves was the terrain of

57
00:04:06,220 --> 00:04:07,580
the Earth itself.

58
00:04:07,820 --> 00:04:12,220
Mount Everest is the tallest point on Earth, but its slope would prematurely stop you long

59
00:04:12,220 --> 00:04:13,980
before you reach the bottom.

60
00:04:13,980 --> 00:04:18,300
For a continuous, uninterrupted fall, you would have to jump from the world's tallest

61
00:04:18,300 --> 00:04:19,300
cliff.

62
00:04:19,300 --> 00:04:25,180
For a purely vertical drop, Mount Thor in Canada has a prominence of over 4,100 feet.

63
00:04:25,180 --> 00:04:29,100
While highly unlikely, it's theoretically possible that somebody could have jumped from

64
00:04:29,100 --> 00:04:30,100
this height.

65
00:04:30,100 --> 00:04:34,340
However, in an age before written history, no one can say for sure.

66
00:04:34,340 --> 00:04:38,780
For the first recording of anyone jumping off anything, we have to venture closer to

67
00:04:38,780 --> 00:04:40,660
the stone mountains of China.

68
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:46,540
As far as we know, this event may have never happened.

69
00:04:46,540 --> 00:04:50,900
The only information on it was written by a guy 2,000 years before our time, about a

70
00:04:50,900 --> 00:04:53,660
guy 2,000 years before his time.

71
00:04:53,660 --> 00:04:58,200
As the legend goes, Emperor Shun escaped the roof of a burning barn by gliding off using

72
00:04:58,200 --> 00:05:00,420
his hat to slow his descent.

73
00:05:00,420 --> 00:05:05,020
By my estimate, the jump was probably done from the equivalent of a two-story building,

74
00:05:05,020 --> 00:05:06,700
or about 20 feet.

75
00:05:06,700 --> 00:05:09,740
It may not sound like much, but this was significant.

76
00:05:09,740 --> 00:05:14,620
It's the earliest recorded instance of anyone jumping with intent rather than falling by

77
00:05:14,620 --> 00:05:15,980
mistake.

78
00:05:15,980 --> 00:05:20,920
All future jumps would be successors to Shun's 20-foot leap off the burning barn.

79
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:25,820
The ancient Chinese were one of the first civilizations to experiment with aeronautics.

80
00:05:25,820 --> 00:05:31,740
As early as 200 BC, acrobats would use bamboo shoots to perform falling stunts at the Imperial

81
00:05:31,740 --> 00:05:32,800
Palace.

82
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:37,520
By 500 AD, kites had become commonplace in Chinese society.

83
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:41,700
Some kite designs had become aerodynamic enough to support the weight of a man.

84
00:05:41,700 --> 00:05:47,020
In 559, Yuan Huang-tou was one of several prisoners ordered to be executed by gliding

85
00:05:47,020 --> 00:05:49,740
off the 108-foot tall Phoenix Tower.

86
00:05:49,740 --> 00:05:54,820
Remarkably, Yuan survived, claiming the unofficial jump record in the process.

87
00:05:54,820 --> 00:05:57,980
For his achievement, Yuan was executed anyway.

88
00:05:57,980 --> 00:06:02,540
Despite his grim fate, the record would remain alive for more than a thousand years.

89
00:06:02,540 --> 00:06:07,100
The next great leap in aeronautical innovation came during the Italian Renaissance.

90
00:06:07,100 --> 00:06:11,540
Leonardo da Vinci is often credited with the invention of the parachute, but an even earlier

91
00:06:11,540 --> 00:06:16,100
concept can be traced back to 1470 from an anonymous manuscript.

92
00:06:16,100 --> 00:06:23,740
In 1615, Fausto Veranzio improved upon Leonardo's design, but so far, the parachute only existed

93
00:06:23,740 --> 00:06:24,740
in concept.

94
00:06:24,740 --> 00:06:29,220
It wasn't until the 18th century that the parachute was brought into reality.

95
00:06:29,220 --> 00:06:33,880
Louis Sebastian Lenerman would design and manufacture the first modern parachute.

96
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:39,620
On December 26, 1783, Lenerman would record the first parachute jump in history by jumping

97
00:06:39,620 --> 00:06:43,180
from the upper balcony of the Montpellier Observatory.

98
00:06:43,180 --> 00:06:48,360
That very same year, just 120 miles away in Annonay, the Montgolfier brothers would develop

99
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:50,140
the first hot air balloon.

100
00:06:50,140 --> 00:06:54,940
Within the span of a few months, mankind had not only broken free from Earth's terrain,

101
00:06:54,940 --> 00:06:58,240
but found a way to weaken the grip of gravity itself.

102
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:05,660
And it was only a matter of time before someone would use both to make history.

103
00:07:05,660 --> 00:07:12,820
On October 22, 1797, Andre Garnerin became the first person to parachute out of an aircraft.

104
00:07:12,820 --> 00:07:17,900
Garnerin rose to 3,200 feet in a hot air balloon, then severed the basket, parachuting back

105
00:07:17,900 --> 00:07:19,580
down unharmed.

106
00:07:19,580 --> 00:07:23,860
You could argue that this wasn't a true jump, as Garnerin never actually stepped out

107
00:07:23,860 --> 00:07:25,560
of the balloon's basket.

108
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:29,740
But based on the illustrations of the basket's design, I would say that it serves little

109
00:07:29,740 --> 00:07:34,620
purpose in actually protecting the user, and rather functions as a necessary component

110
00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:36,540
of the parachute itself.

111
00:07:36,540 --> 00:07:40,980
The important thing is that Andre Garnerin flew about 500 feet higher than the top of

112
00:07:40,980 --> 00:07:46,100
the Burj Khalifa, then severed his only means of flotation, placing full faith in the thin

113
00:07:46,100 --> 00:07:50,620
fabric above his head to ensure that he didn't wind up becoming a human crepe.

114
00:07:50,620 --> 00:07:56,140
On that day in 1797, Andre Garnerin became the first skydiver.

115
00:07:56,140 --> 00:08:00,060
Just five years later, he would set a new all-time record, jumping from a height of

116
00:08:00,060 --> 00:08:01,780
8,000 feet.

117
00:08:01,780 --> 00:08:06,280
Garnerin's aerial heroics would inspire a new generation of daredevils who would replicate

118
00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:09,740
his death-defying stunt in front of spectators around the world.

119
00:08:09,740 --> 00:08:14,560
19th century parachuters would draw crowds at local carnivals and other venues by dropping

120
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:18,020
out of the sky from altitudes of 2 to 5,000 feet.

121
00:08:18,020 --> 00:08:22,520
This range is comparable to the cruising altitude of the Fortnite battle bus, and while the

122
00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:26,900
stunts looked death-defying, sometimes death would not be defied.

123
00:08:26,900 --> 00:08:32,560
In 1837, Robert Cocking earned the grim distinction of becoming the first skydiving fatality after

124
00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:35,460
his parachute failed at 5,000 feet.

125
00:08:35,460 --> 00:08:39,440
Cocking was supposedly attempting to reach the 8,000-foot mark that Garnerin had set

126
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:43,240
decades prior, but the record would not be undone.

127
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:47,360
The use of Cocking's death was a sobering reminder to the dangers of falling from thousands

128
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:52,760
of feet in the air, and it extinguished the popularity of parachuting for decades afterwards.

129
00:08:52,760 --> 00:08:57,960
For the rest of the 1800s, there were no jump attempts on record surpassing Garnerin's

130
00:08:57,960 --> 00:08:59,260
8,000-foot mark.

131
00:08:59,260 --> 00:09:03,720
This was mostly due to the limitations of parachutes, as balloons continued to soar

132
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:05,760
throughout the 19th century.

133
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:10,280
Since would-be jumpers were no longer encumbered by the earth's terrain, the highest theoretical

134
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:14,320
jump was now determined by the balloon altitude record.

135
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:24,760
Even at this time, unmanned balloons could easily rise to tens of thousands of feet,

136
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:29,040
but manned flights now had to deal with the limits of human physiology.

137
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:34,980
Above 15,000 feet, most people will begin to suffer the effects of oxygen deprivation.

138
00:09:34,980 --> 00:09:39,360
Most modern-day skydiving excursions will not fly above this altitude for that very

139
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:40,560
reason.

140
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:45,940
Above 26,000 feet is the Death Zone, the limit beyond which the human body can no longer

141
00:09:45,940 --> 00:09:48,720
survive without supplemental oxygen.

142
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:53,960
In 1862, James Glacier and Henry Cockswell became the first people to surpass the Death

143
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:54,960
Zone.

144
00:09:54,960 --> 00:10:00,280
At around 29,000 feet, the pair lost consciousness, with Cockswell barely managing to pull the

145
00:10:00,280 --> 00:10:02,960
balloon's valve cord before blacking out.

146
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:07,360
The pair survived when the balloon rapidly descended back to a safe height, but not before

147
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:12,800
setting a new altitude record estimated between 29,000 and 37,000 feet.

148
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:18,680
By 1887, oxygen tanks became commercially available, allowing ballooners to safely enter

149
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:20,120
the Death Zone.

150
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:25,960
In 1901, Arthur Burson and Reinhard Sühring set an official record of 35,000 feet in a

151
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:30,200
hydrogen balloon, this time remaining conscious to record it.

152
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:35,940
In 1927, Hawthorne Gray became the first person to pass the 40,000-foot mark, but perished

153
00:10:35,940 --> 00:10:37,860
after running out of oxygen.

154
00:10:37,860 --> 00:10:43,840
In 1931, August Picard and Paul Kipfer passed the 50,000-foot mark, becoming the first people

155
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:47,860
to enter the stratosphere, as well as the first people to truly witness the curvature

156
00:10:47,860 --> 00:10:48,860
of the Earth.

157
00:10:48,860 --> 00:10:53,680
In 1933, at the Century of Progress World Fair, Thomas Settle and Chester Fordney would

158
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:55,800
surpass 60,000 feet.

159
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:59,620
By this point, record attempts were quickly approaching the next hard limit in manned

160
00:10:59,620 --> 00:11:01,120
balloon flights.

161
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:06,760
As altitude increases, air pressure decreases, as does the boiling point of fluids.

162
00:11:06,760 --> 00:11:11,200
At around 60,000 feet, air pressure is low enough where the temperature of your body

163
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:16,400
will exceed the boiling point of water, causing your blood to literally boil.

164
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:20,860
This limit is otherwise known as the Armstrong Line, and future flights above it would require

165
00:11:20,860 --> 00:11:22,740
a pressurized suit.

166
00:11:22,740 --> 00:11:27,860
In 1934, the Soviet Union's Osevayikin-1 surpassed the Armstrong Line and reached a

167
00:11:27,860 --> 00:11:33,320
peak altitude of 72,000 feet before the balloon disintegrated during its descent, killing

168
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:35,060
all three crew members.

169
00:11:35,060 --> 00:11:39,440
One year later, in what would be a precursor to the Space Race, the United States took

170
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:45,340
back the record when Albert Stevens and Orville Anderson reached 72,400 feet in the Explorer

171
00:11:45,340 --> 00:11:46,540
II craft.

172
00:11:46,540 --> 00:11:50,300
By this point, balloon flight progression had provided the jump record with massive

173
00:11:50,300 --> 00:11:54,860
potential for improvement, but before anyone could attempt a new record, the parachute

174
00:11:54,860 --> 00:12:03,160
would have to rise to the occasion.

175
00:12:03,160 --> 00:12:07,580
The turn of the 20th century saw two tremendous strides in aeronautics, with the invention

176
00:12:07,580 --> 00:12:09,860
of the airplane and the airship.

177
00:12:09,860 --> 00:12:14,220
The unprecedented boom in air travel renewed interest in the parachute.

178
00:12:14,220 --> 00:12:19,420
In 1907, aerial stuntman Charles Brodwick would provide the first major parachute innovation

179
00:12:19,420 --> 00:12:23,620
with a static line, which allowed the chute to automatically deploy when jumping out of

180
00:12:23,620 --> 00:12:25,040
an aircraft.

181
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:29,940
In 1914, Brodwick's adopted daughter Tiny became the first person to manually deploy

182
00:12:29,940 --> 00:12:34,580
a chute while in freefall, eventually leading to the invention of the ripcord.

183
00:12:34,580 --> 00:12:40,500
And starting in 1919, Leslie Ervin began manufacturing and distributing the Type A parachute for

184
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:43,100
use as life preservers on airplanes.

185
00:12:43,100 --> 00:12:47,120
The Ervin chute would revitalize the pastime of stunt jumping.

186
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:51,540
Just as the balloon jumpers would perform death-defying jumps a century earlier, a new

187
00:12:51,540 --> 00:12:57,540
generation of aerial acrobats would wow spectators by jumping from the cockpits of their airplanes.

188
00:12:57,540 --> 00:13:02,060
This new wave of daredevils became known as the Barnstormers, the most famous of which

189
00:13:02,060 --> 00:13:05,020
was a man by the name of Charles Lindbergh.

190
00:13:05,020 --> 00:13:09,320
Lindbergh was most known for making the first non-stop transatlantic flight, but buried

191
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:13,860
among his long list of aviation accomplishments was the new record for the world's highest

192
00:13:13,860 --> 00:13:14,860
jump.

193
00:13:14,860 --> 00:13:20,220
In 1926, Lindbergh used an Ervin chute to bail out of his plane at an altitude of 13,000

194
00:13:20,220 --> 00:13:24,300
feet, finally breaking Garnerin's record after more than a century.

195
00:13:24,300 --> 00:13:29,820
1927 saw the first tests of parachutes in military combat, leading to the rise of the

196
00:13:29,820 --> 00:13:30,820
paratrooper.

197
00:13:30,820 --> 00:13:36,380
In 1943, U.S. Army surgeon Randy Lovelace became the first person on record to jump

198
00:13:36,380 --> 00:13:37,860
from the stratosphere.

199
00:13:37,860 --> 00:13:43,240
In an Air Force experiment, Lovelace bailed out of an army bomber at over 40,000 feet.

200
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:47,740
The force of the parachute knocked him unconscious, and the minus 40 degree temperatures left

201
00:13:47,740 --> 00:13:49,300
his hands frostbitten.

202
00:13:49,300 --> 00:13:53,900
But Lovelace survived the jump by the skin of his teeth, claiming the record in the process.

203
00:13:53,900 --> 00:13:58,420
The first ever jump from the stratosphere would be the last with a conventional parachute,

204
00:13:58,420 --> 00:14:00,400
at least in the United States.

205
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:05,280
Soviet jumpers Vasily Romanuk and Nikolai Nikitin would both set higher marks, with

206
00:14:05,280 --> 00:14:09,800
Nikitin surpassing 47,000 feet in 1957.

207
00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:15,300
While the Russians were fixated on the record itself, the U.S. directed their focus to survival.

208
00:14:15,300 --> 00:14:19,580
If pilots were to survive ejecting at very high altitudes, they would need to be equipped

209
00:14:19,580 --> 00:14:22,220
with parachutes fit for the edge of space.

210
00:14:22,220 --> 00:14:27,420
Randy Lovelace's near-fatal jump would usher in a new era, the dawn of the space jump.

211
00:14:35,420 --> 00:14:37,020
I'm going to jump!

212
00:14:37,020 --> 00:14:38,020
No!

213
00:14:38,020 --> 00:14:41,020
Do a flip!

214
00:14:41,020 --> 00:14:47,780
Patients of YouTube, it is I, Dr. Spiral, standing here atop this three-story structure.

215
00:14:47,780 --> 00:14:53,260
Now in my medical opinion, I would say that it's unsafe to fall from this height.

216
00:14:53,260 --> 00:14:56,380
I mean, a fall from this height can make your hair fall out.

217
00:14:56,380 --> 00:14:59,980
Skydivers can fall faster than 120 miles per hour.

218
00:14:59,980 --> 00:15:02,860
In those conditions, your hair won't last long.

219
00:15:02,860 --> 00:15:06,860
That's why if you're planning to jump off anything, I recommend using Keeps Hair Loss

220
00:15:06,860 --> 00:15:08,540
Prevention first.

221
00:15:08,540 --> 00:15:13,020

00:15:16,540 --> 00:15:22,260
Now, to demonstrate Keeps' 90% effectiveness at treating and reducing the symptoms of hair

224
00:15:22,260 --> 00:15:26,540
loss, I will jump off this three-story structure right now!

225
00:15:30,540 --> 00:15:31,540
Oh!

226
00:15:31,540 --> 00:15:32,540
Oh!

227
00:15:32,540 --> 00:15:33,540
Oh my gosh!

228
00:15:33,540 --> 00:15:34,540
Wow!

229
00:15:34,540 --> 00:15:37,220
I really just fell from all the way up there!

230
00:15:37,220 --> 00:15:39,220
Keeps kept my hair safe!

231
00:15:39,220 --> 00:15:40,540
My hair...

232
00:15:40,540 --> 00:15:43,520
It's game over for hair loss!

235
00:15:56,260 --> 00:16:01,300
Scientifically speaking, outer space doesn't begin until the Karman line, more than 300,000

236
00:16:01,300 --> 00:16:02,300
feet high.

237
00:16:02,300 --> 00:16:07,660
The region between it and the Armstrong line is classified as near space, and as jet planes

238
00:16:07,660 --> 00:16:13,180
flew higher, pilots would need a new kind of parachute to safely eject from this range.

239
00:16:13,180 --> 00:16:18,500
Following Randy Loveless' near-fatal jump, the Air Force began testing experimental high-altitude

240
00:16:18,500 --> 00:16:20,420
parachutes on dummies.

241
00:16:20,420 --> 00:16:24,100
Early designs would force the dummies into an uncontrollable flat spin that would be

242
00:16:24,100 --> 00:16:26,780
potentially fatal on human subjects.

243
00:16:26,780 --> 00:16:31,940
By 1958, they were ready to test out a new multi-stage design that was intended to stabilize

244
00:16:31,940 --> 00:16:33,220
the jumper.

245
00:16:33,220 --> 00:16:38,580
Only this time, the test would be conducted on a human being, an unenviable task bestowed

246
00:16:38,580 --> 00:16:40,780
upon Captain Joseph Kittinger.

247
00:16:46,300 --> 00:16:50,080
Kittinger had already proven himself as the Air Force's new favorite guinea pig with

248
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:56,440
his role in Project Manhigh, a 1957 research assignment that saw Kittinger soar 96,000

249
00:16:56,440 --> 00:17:00,460
feet in a balloon, setting a new altitude record in the process.

250
00:17:00,500 --> 00:17:05,200
His next assignment would be Project Excelsior, where Kittinger would once again rise to the

251
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:09,500
stratosphere in a balloon, only this time he would have to jump out.

252
00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:15,960
On November 16, 1959, Kittinger fastened his pressure suit and boarded Excelsior 1, rising

253
00:17:15,960 --> 00:17:19,400
to an altitude of 76,400 feet.

254
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:24,660
At that point, Kittinger unstrapped himself from the gondola and stepped over the edge.

255
00:17:24,660 --> 00:17:26,580
Immediately there was a problem.

256
00:17:26,580 --> 00:17:30,060
Kittinger had prematurely deployed his stabilization chute.

257
00:17:30,060 --> 00:17:33,760
Just like the test dummies, Kittinger entered an uncontrollable spin.

258
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:39,200
At 120 rpm, Kittinger blacked out nearly 13 miles above the Earth.

259
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:42,700
He regained consciousness just 3,000 feet from the ground.

260
00:17:42,700 --> 00:17:47,220
Miraculously, the rest of the chutes functioned according to plan, allowing Joe Kittinger

261
00:17:47,220 --> 00:17:50,340
to escape with his life and a new record.

262
00:17:50,340 --> 00:17:54,380
Despite a near disaster on the first run, Kittinger was determined to prove that the

263
00:17:54,380 --> 00:17:56,540
new parachute system could work.

264
00:17:56,540 --> 00:18:01,540
Less than a month later, Kittinger would return to the skies with Excelsior 2, jumping from

265
00:18:01,540 --> 00:18:03,300
74,000 feet.

266
00:18:03,300 --> 00:18:07,540
This time the parachutes functioned flawlessly, and although he was just shy of adding to

267
00:18:07,540 --> 00:18:12,380
the record, he would get one more chance to make history in the summer of 1960.

268
00:18:12,380 --> 00:18:17,260
On the morning of August 16, Kittinger boarded the gondola for Excelsior 3.

269
00:18:17,260 --> 00:18:21,380
Sudden cloud cover almost canceled the mission before it started, but Kittinger launched

270
00:18:21,380 --> 00:18:24,740
just one minute before the orders to cancel the flight.

271
00:18:24,740 --> 00:18:28,680
Soon after, overcast skies would be the least of his concerns.

272
00:18:28,680 --> 00:18:33,900
At about 50,000 feet, Kittinger realized that his right glove had failed to pressurize,

273
00:18:33,900 --> 00:18:36,780
causing his hand to swell to twice its size.

274
00:18:36,780 --> 00:18:41,980
Despite the potentially catastrophic complication, Kittinger did not inform the ground crew.

275
00:18:41,980 --> 00:18:45,620
He knew that if he did, the mission would be immediately aborted.

276
00:18:45,620 --> 00:18:49,660
Anticipating that they would never get another chance at a jump, Kittinger bit the bullet

277
00:18:49,660 --> 00:18:51,560
and continued to rise.

278
00:18:51,560 --> 00:18:56,300
About one hour and forty minutes after launch, Kittinger took the highest step in the world,

279
00:18:56,300 --> 00:18:59,020
and jumped from the stratosphere for the final time.

280
00:18:59,020 --> 00:19:02,780
Kittinger free-filled for four and a half minutes before deploying his main chute.

281
00:19:02,780 --> 00:19:06,140
He reached a top speed of 614 miles per hour.

282
00:19:06,140 --> 00:19:10,300
Thirteen minutes and forty-five seconds after stepping out of the gondola, Joe Kittinger

283
00:19:10,300 --> 00:19:12,920
touched down in the New Mexico desert.

284
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:14,920
The ground crew was ecstatic.

285
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:19,540
Not only was Excelsior 3 a resounding success, but Kittinger had just landed from the highest

286
00:19:19,740 --> 00:19:21,260
jump in history.

287
00:19:21,260 --> 00:19:23,260
So just how high did Joe go?

288
00:19:44,260 --> 00:19:47,320
102,800 feet.

289
00:19:47,320 --> 00:19:52,000
Not only did Joe Kittinger set the all-time jump record, he did so while setting the all-time

290
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:57,780
balloon altitude record, the second highest altitude ever reached by man at that point.

291
00:19:57,780 --> 00:20:02,440
After proving that humans could survive exposure to the upper atmosphere, Project Excelsior

292
00:20:02,440 --> 00:20:05,840
would open the floodgates for manned space exploration.

293
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:10,460
Soon after, both the US and Soviet Union would send the first astronauts into orbit.

294
00:20:10,460 --> 00:20:13,780
But in that moment, Kittinger stood farther from the Earth's surface than all but a

295
00:20:13,780 --> 00:20:17,580
single person before him, and then jumped back down.

296
00:20:17,580 --> 00:20:21,980
Years later while serving in Vietnam, Kittinger would be captured as a prisoner of war after

297
00:20:21,980 --> 00:20:23,920
his plane was shot down.

298
00:20:23,920 --> 00:20:26,420
One has to wonder which moment was more terrifying.

299
00:20:30,420 --> 00:20:35,460
Remarkably, despite accomplishing one of the most impressive feats in the history of aviation,

300
00:20:35,460 --> 00:20:37,720
Kittinger never actually cared about the record.

301
00:20:37,720 --> 00:20:42,100
He took far more satisfaction in completing the mission and validating the effectiveness

302
00:20:42,100 --> 00:20:43,980
of the high altitude parachute.

303
00:20:43,980 --> 00:20:47,420
Ironically, the record would go on to define his legacy.

304
00:20:47,420 --> 00:20:52,380
Before Joe Kittinger, the jump record only existed as a formality, a sloppy and poorly

305
00:20:52,380 --> 00:20:56,700
documented patchwork of events consisting mostly of people who stumbled into the record

306
00:20:56,700 --> 00:20:58,780
completely unintentionally.

307
00:20:58,780 --> 00:21:03,620
In many ways, Kittinger was no different, but after Excelsior, the record would never

308
00:21:03,620 --> 00:21:04,620
be the same.

309
00:21:04,620 --> 00:21:09,260
It was the first time that the world's highest jump was documented, broadcasted, and celebrated

310
00:21:09,260 --> 00:21:10,660
in the media.

311
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:15,520
Kittinger had effectively made the record tangible, and before long, a new wave of contenders

312
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:17,020
were lining up to break it.

313
00:21:21,020 --> 00:21:25,420
Naturally, the first people to challenge for the American record were the Russians.

314
00:21:25,420 --> 00:21:30,640
In 1962, Pyotr Dolgov and Yevgeny Andreyev were tasked with the Soviet Union's first

315
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:32,660
attempt at a space jump.

316
00:21:32,660 --> 00:21:38,900
Andreyev successfully jumped from 83,000 feet, setting a new record for the longest freefall.

317
00:21:38,900 --> 00:21:44,540
Dolgov jumped from nearly 94,000 feet, but perished after his suit depressurized.

318
00:21:44,540 --> 00:21:49,460
Dolgov's death would be covered up for years, but as far as the Soviets were concerned,

319
00:21:49,460 --> 00:21:51,660
the mission was a success.

320
00:21:51,660 --> 00:21:56,300
Even though Joe Kittinger's record was well documented and precisely measured with state-of-the-art

321
00:21:56,300 --> 00:22:01,820
technology, it wasn't verified by the FAI, allowing the Soviets to claim the official

322
00:22:01,820 --> 00:22:05,100
record despite falling nearly 20,000 feet short.

323
00:22:05,100 --> 00:22:09,420
For all intents and purposes, Joe Kittinger still held the record, but the Soviets had

324
00:22:09,420 --> 00:22:13,740
the validation of a bureaucratic sanctioning body in Switzerland, and they were content

325
00:22:13,740 --> 00:22:14,860
with that.

326
00:22:14,860 --> 00:22:19,020
Not content with the disputed title was a young adventurer from New Jersey, Nicholas

327
00:22:19,020 --> 00:22:20,100
Piantanita.

328
00:22:24,340 --> 00:22:28,260
The young skydiver had been obsessed with jumping ever since his childhood, where he

329
00:22:28,260 --> 00:22:32,100
would nearly fall to his death after jumping from the roof of his apartment with a makeshift

330
00:22:32,100 --> 00:22:34,340
parachute made from his bedsheets.

331
00:22:34,340 --> 00:22:39,500
By the 60s, Piantanita was determined to bring the undisputed record back to America by making

332
00:22:39,500 --> 00:22:41,460
the greatest jump in history.

333
00:22:41,460 --> 00:22:45,700
His goal was to break both Kittinger's altitude record and Andreyev's freefall record in

334
00:22:45,700 --> 00:22:48,740
what would become known as Project Stratojump.

335
00:22:48,740 --> 00:22:53,440
But unlike the space jumpers before him, Piantanita didn't have government backing.

336
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:58,300
He had to essentially create his own ragtag aeronautical research program from scratch,

337
00:22:58,300 --> 00:23:01,740
using sponsors, volunteers, and borrowed facilities.

338
00:23:01,740 --> 00:23:06,940
While preparing for the jump, Piantanita sought out consultation from Joe Kittinger himself.

339
00:23:06,940 --> 00:23:10,580
Kittinger, never a fan of chasing records, refused.

340
00:23:10,580 --> 00:23:14,660
He had nearly lost his life performing the feat just a few years prior, and he didn't

341
00:23:14,660 --> 00:23:19,060
appreciate Piantanita's cavalier attitude towards the daunting challenge.

342
00:23:19,060 --> 00:23:23,900
However, despite his barebones resources, Piantanita and the Strat-O team managed to

343
00:23:23,900 --> 00:23:27,540
assemble a working balloon, gondola, and pressure suit.

344
00:23:27,540 --> 00:23:33,060
By the autumn of 1965, Nick Piantanita was ready to take to the skies.

345
00:23:33,060 --> 00:23:38,940
On October 22, Stratojump 1 lifted off from a field outside of St. Paul, Minnesota.

346
00:23:38,940 --> 00:23:43,880
Unfortunately, high wind shear would destroy the balloon at just 16,000 feet, forcing an

347
00:23:43,880 --> 00:23:46,560
emergency landing and a second attempt.

348
00:23:46,560 --> 00:23:50,380
He would try again on February 2, 1966.

349
00:23:50,380 --> 00:23:54,540
This time, the balloon had no problem reaching the stratosphere where it continued rising.

350
00:23:54,540 --> 00:24:02,140
Soon, it had soared past Andreyev's mark of 80,000, then past Kittinger's mark of 102,000.

351
00:24:02,140 --> 00:24:08,220
Piantanita's balloon topped out at an unprecedented height of 123,500 feet.

352
00:24:08,220 --> 00:24:10,920
His unyielding hubris was about to pay off.

353
00:24:10,920 --> 00:24:13,480
The record was tantalizingly close.

354
00:24:13,480 --> 00:24:22,800
All Nick Piantanita had to do was step out of the gondola and into the record books.

355
00:24:22,800 --> 00:24:24,260
But there was a problem.

356
00:24:24,260 --> 00:24:28,940
The oxygen line tethering Piantanita to the gondola wouldn't detach, and he had no way

357
00:24:28,940 --> 00:24:30,860
of severing the connection.

358
00:24:30,860 --> 00:24:35,440
After several agonizing minutes at the edge of glory, the ground crew decided to abort

359
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:36,580
the mission.

360
00:24:36,580 --> 00:24:42,480
In a turbulent and dangerous descent, a battered Piantanita returned to Earth with the gondola.

361
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:46,560
After the heartbreaking failure, Piantanita would not be deterred.

362
00:24:46,560 --> 00:24:53,180
On May 1, 1966, he stepped back into the gondola with the goal of once again reaching the 120,000

363
00:24:53,180 --> 00:24:54,300
foot mark.

364
00:24:54,300 --> 00:25:05,820
This time, he would pay the ultimate price.

365
00:25:05,820 --> 00:25:10,320
At 57,000 feet, Nick Piantanita's suit depressurized.

366
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:15,700
The ground crew immediately aborted the mission, but at that point, very little could be done.

367
00:25:15,700 --> 00:25:20,500
Piantanita was starved of oxygen for more than 20 minutes, falling into a coma from

368
00:25:20,500 --> 00:25:22,340
which he never recovered.

369
00:25:22,340 --> 00:25:27,080
As close as he came to proving everyone wrong, Piantanita's recklessness would ultimately

370
00:25:27,080 --> 00:25:28,620
cost him everything.

371
00:25:28,620 --> 00:25:33,800
He met a cruelly fitting fate, spending his final moments in the sky, the place he always

372
00:25:33,800 --> 00:25:38,640
seemed to belong.

373
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:43,100
The stratojump catastrophe would mark the end of record attempts for a while.

374
00:25:43,100 --> 00:25:48,260
Neither of the two world superpowers were interested in balloon jump escapades anymore.

375
00:25:48,260 --> 00:25:51,200
They had moved on to new frontiers.

376
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:55,400
Later record holders would have to independently direct their own operations.

377
00:25:55,400 --> 00:26:00,020
After progressing through millennia of physical barriers to the sky, the newest limitations

378
00:26:00,020 --> 00:26:03,420
to the jump record were now cost and ambition.

379
00:26:03,420 --> 00:26:08,400
The 60s had quickly become the age of the astronaut, and the boom in space exploration

380
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:12,400
had taken much of the luster off the once vaunted space jump.

381
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:16,900
It seemed that the only notable jumps of this era happened by complete chance.

382
00:26:16,900 --> 00:26:22,940
In 1966, American pilot Bill Weaver would survive a 78,000 foot fall after ejecting

383
00:26:22,940 --> 00:26:24,960
from a jet at Mach 3.

384
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:29,040
His life would be spared thanks to the same parachute design that Joe Kittinger had tested

385
00:26:29,040 --> 00:26:31,020
just six years prior.

386
00:26:31,020 --> 00:26:37,800
In 1971, DB Cooper became the first and only person to successfully commit airplane piracy,

387
00:26:37,800 --> 00:26:42,340
parachuting an estimated 10,000 feet with $200,000 in ransom money.

388
00:26:42,340 --> 00:26:47,860
In 1973, Serbian flight attendant Vensa Vulovic survived the highest fall on record without

389
00:26:47,860 --> 00:26:52,580
a parachute after the plane she was servicing exploded at 33,000 feet.

390
00:26:52,580 --> 00:26:58,300
And in 1982, Larry Walter survived an ascent to 16,000 feet after tying dozens of weather

391
00:26:58,300 --> 00:27:00,220
balloons to a lawn chair.

392
00:27:00,220 --> 00:27:04,700
The next attempt at the world's highest jump wouldn't happen until the 90s with decorated

393
00:27:04,700 --> 00:27:07,240
British paratrooper Nish Bruce.

394
00:27:07,240 --> 00:27:11,740
Starting in the early 90s, Bruce began training for the eventual Skydive from Space project

395
00:27:11,740 --> 00:27:15,260
where he would make a planned jump from 130,000 feet.

396
00:27:15,260 --> 00:27:19,700
The project was partially funded by NASA, who wanted to test the effects of radiation

397
00:27:19,700 --> 00:27:21,420
at high altitudes.

398
00:27:21,420 --> 00:27:26,580
Despite an encouraging start, the project would abruptly end in 1994 when Bruce suffered

399
00:27:26,580 --> 00:27:31,120
an unexpected mental breakdown, stabbing his girlfriend with a pair of scissors.

400
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:35,300
The incident would mark the beginning of Bruce's eight-year-long battle with mental illness,

401
00:27:35,300 --> 00:27:37,900
a battle he would eventually lose.

402
00:27:37,900 --> 00:27:42,320
In 2002, Nish Bruce would end his life by intentionally jumping from a plane without

403
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:43,740
a parachute.

404
00:27:43,740 --> 00:27:48,780
Much like Nick Piantanita, Nish Bruce was someone who seemed to belong to the sky, this

405
00:27:48,780 --> 00:28:00,380
time going out on his own terms.

406
00:28:00,380 --> 00:28:05,380
After four decades of magnificent failure since Project Excelsior, the new millennium

407
00:28:05,380 --> 00:28:09,100
would bring a new wave of contenders trying to beat the record.

408
00:28:09,100 --> 00:28:14,260
Starting in 2000, Cheryl Stearns would announce her plans to jump from 130,000 feet with the

409
00:28:14,260 --> 00:28:16,980
formation of the StratoQuest project.

410
00:28:16,980 --> 00:28:22,060
Stearns was the most accomplished female skydiver in history and was prepared to make the ultimate

411
00:28:22,060 --> 00:28:24,460
jump in the spring of 2001.

412
00:28:24,460 --> 00:28:28,620
Unfortunately, StratoQuest could never quite materialize.

413
00:28:28,620 --> 00:28:33,220
After numerous delays and funding issues, the project had fallen defunct by the end of

414
00:28:33,220 --> 00:28:34,220
the 2000s.

415
00:28:34,620 --> 00:28:39,860
An Australian man, Rod Milner, announced that next March, he plans to skydive from 25 miles

416
00:28:39,860 --> 00:28:45,260
above the Earth, reaching speeds over a thousand miles an hour and breaking the sound barrier.

417
00:28:45,260 --> 00:28:50,580
In 2001, Australian skydiver Rod Milner would make waves in the media by announcing his

418
00:28:50,580 --> 00:28:55,340
plan to jump from 130,000 feet and break the sound barrier with his fall.

419
00:28:55,340 --> 00:29:00,260
The mission, titled Project Space Jump, had reportedly secured funding from the Australian

420
00:29:00,260 --> 00:29:04,900
Defence Force Academy with plans to launch a year later in March 2002.

421
00:29:04,900 --> 00:29:09,540
Well, a year came and went and no jump was ever attempted.

422
00:29:09,540 --> 00:29:14,420
Following the initial media hype, Project Space Jump was never discussed again and eventually

423
00:29:14,420 --> 00:29:19,620
forgotten, coming off much more like a publicity stunt than an actual attempt at the record.

424
00:29:19,620 --> 00:29:25,300
In 2003, French adventurer Michel Fournier announced Les Grand Sau, during which he planned

425
00:29:25,300 --> 00:29:27,900
to jump from 130,000 feet.

426
00:29:27,900 --> 00:29:32,140
Fournier made the most progress of anyone in the decade, managing to produce a working

427
00:29:32,140 --> 00:29:34,420
balloon, pressure suit, and gondola.

428
00:29:34,420 --> 00:29:39,620
Unfortunately, all of Fournier's attempts would be aborted before they could even launch.

429
00:29:39,620 --> 00:29:44,380
After spending two decades and nearly 20 million dollars chasing the record, Michel Fournier

430
00:29:44,380 --> 00:29:46,420
couldn't even get off the ground.

431
00:29:46,420 --> 00:29:51,180
2010 would mark the 50-year anniversary of Joe Kittinger's record, and after half a

432
00:29:51,180 --> 00:29:55,300
century of failure, many began to wonder whether anyone could break it.

433
00:29:58,900 --> 00:30:04,100
Starting in 2010, Red Bull would sponsor the Stratos project and team up with Austrian

434
00:30:04,100 --> 00:30:09,020
skydiver Felix Baumgartner to finally top Kittinger's record once and for all.

435
00:30:09,020 --> 00:30:12,940
Preparing Felix for the jump would be none other than Joe Kittinger himself.

436
00:30:12,940 --> 00:30:17,300
Kittinger's blessings seemed to ward off the demons that had plagued all other attempts

437
00:30:17,300 --> 00:30:18,940
since he set the record.

438
00:30:18,940 --> 00:30:23,540
In March 2012, Baumgartner would successfully complete the project's first test jump from

439
00:30:23,540 --> 00:30:25,220
71,000 feet.

440
00:30:25,220 --> 00:30:30,300
In July, he would complete the second test jump, this time from 96,000 feet.

441
00:30:30,300 --> 00:30:36,100
And finally, on October 14, 2012, Felix Baumgartner was ready to make history in a moment streamed

442
00:30:36,100 --> 00:30:38,100
live around the world.

443
00:30:55,220 --> 00:31:13,420
After finally having his record broken, Joe Kittinger never looked happier.

444
00:31:13,420 --> 00:31:18,620
After 52 years of frustration, there was finally a new record holder of the world's highest

445
00:31:18,620 --> 00:31:19,620
jump.

446
00:31:19,620 --> 00:31:23,260
In addition to setting the altitude record, Felix Baumgartner became the first jumper

447
00:31:23,260 --> 00:31:27,300
in history to break the sound barrier in his freefall, as well as setting the record

448
00:31:27,300 --> 00:31:29,860
for the longest distance in freefall.

449
00:31:29,860 --> 00:31:34,660
The YouTube livestream was watched by nearly 10 million viewers, a record that itself would

450
00:31:34,660 --> 00:31:36,740
stand for almost six years.

451
00:31:36,740 --> 00:31:41,700
The new record provided a rare moment of inspiration for a generation who had very little to celebrate

452
00:31:41,700 --> 00:31:43,780
in terms of aeronautical achievement.

453
00:31:43,780 --> 00:31:46,680
Truly, it was a jump for the ages.

454
00:31:46,680 --> 00:31:51,500
After taking half a century to be Kittinger's mark of 102,000, who knew how long it would

455
00:31:51,500 --> 00:31:58,720
take to beat Baumgartner, the record would stand for two years.

456
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:04,860
On October 24, 2014, computer scientist Alan Eustace would set a new altitude record of

457
00:32:04,860 --> 00:32:08,180
135,889 feet.

458
00:32:08,180 --> 00:32:13,300
Eustace worked as the senior VP of engineering at Google and had no prior history of skydiving

459
00:32:13,300 --> 00:32:14,940
or extreme stunts.

460
00:32:14,940 --> 00:32:19,300
One day he decided that he wanted to pursue the record, so he assembled a team of collaborators

461
00:32:19,300 --> 00:32:20,900
to form Stratex.

462
00:32:20,900 --> 00:32:25,500
Eustace became the first jumper in history to ascend to the stratosphere without a gondola,

463
00:32:25,500 --> 00:32:29,700
relying only on a pressure suit to protect him from the vacuum of near space.

464
00:32:29,700 --> 00:32:34,180
The reduction in weight allowed him to soar more than 8,000 feet higher than Baumgartner's

465
00:32:34,180 --> 00:32:35,180
mark.

466
00:32:35,180 --> 00:32:39,300
In just a single attempt at the record, Alan Eustace went up and got it.

467
00:32:39,300 --> 00:32:42,460
That's where the record stands today, but where does it go from here?

468
00:32:42,460 --> 00:32:48,060
Well, the record for the highest unmanned balloon flight is 173,900 feet.

469
00:32:48,180 --> 00:32:52,660
Fighter weight missions like Stratex may approach this altitude, but sooner or later, jumpers

470
00:32:52,660 --> 00:32:56,220
will reach another hard limit, the mesosphere.

471
00:32:56,220 --> 00:33:01,500
Starting at around 170,000 feet, the air becomes thin enough to force any balloon to burst

472
00:33:01,500 --> 00:33:03,260
from the pressure difference.

473
00:33:03,260 --> 00:33:08,180
As a result, the mesosphere is the least explored part of the atmosphere, extending too high

474
00:33:08,180 --> 00:33:11,140
for balloons and too low for satellites.

475
00:33:11,140 --> 00:33:15,420
But what if you were to skip the mesosphere entirely and jump from a satellite?

476
00:33:15,420 --> 00:33:19,540
The International Space Station orbits in the thermosphere at an average altitude of

477
00:33:19,540 --> 00:33:24,540
about 1.3 million feet, nearly 10 times the height of the current record.

478
00:33:24,540 --> 00:33:29,660
However, since the ISS is in orbit, it's traveling about 10 times faster than an average

479
00:33:29,660 --> 00:33:30,740
bullet.

480
00:33:30,740 --> 00:33:35,580
Re-entering the atmosphere at that speed will cause the human body to burn up like a meteor.

481
00:33:35,580 --> 00:33:39,860
Currently, the best hope for space jumps beyond the stratosphere may be Virgin Galactic's

482
00:33:39,860 --> 00:33:45,740
SpaceShipTwo, a suborbital space plane capable of surpassing the 300,000-foot mark.

483
00:33:45,740 --> 00:33:50,260
Due to the parabolic shape of the flight path, it could be theoretically possible to jump

484
00:33:50,260 --> 00:33:53,100
from the peak without extreme exit velocity.

485
00:33:53,100 --> 00:33:57,800
Virgin Galactic plans to launch commercial flights on the space plane starting this decade,

486
00:33:57,800 --> 00:34:02,620
so it's possible that the next great stride in space jumping may be just a few years away.

487
00:34:02,620 --> 00:34:06,580
For now, the record stands at just under 136,000 feet.

488
00:34:06,580 --> 00:34:11,280
No matter the era, death-defying jumps have never failed to amaze and inspire those who

489
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:12,660
witness them.

490
00:34:12,660 --> 00:34:20,540
Space jumping is both a product and an example of our endless thirst for progress.

491
00:34:20,540 --> 00:34:25,660
Sixty years ago as Joe Kittinger gazed down at the Earth prior to his record-setting jump,

492
00:34:25,660 --> 00:34:30,060
he remarked at the irony of such beauty existing in such deadly conditions.

493
00:34:30,060 --> 00:34:34,860
He compared floating through the stratosphere to being enveloped in an ocean of cyanide.

494
00:34:34,860 --> 00:34:39,500
Despite literally being on top of the world, Kittinger was overcome with an overwhelming

495
00:34:39,500 --> 00:34:44,340
sense of humility.

496
00:34:44,340 --> 00:34:50,160
We defy nature by venturing higher and higher, and nature humbles us with its unconquerable

497
00:34:50,160 --> 00:34:51,620
vastness.

498
00:34:51,620 --> 00:34:56,800
After 4,000 years of trying, we have already managed to jump from unfathomable heights,

499
00:34:56,800 --> 00:34:59,260
but we still have so much farther to go.

500
00:34:59,260 --> 00:35:02,500
For the future of the world's highest jump, the sky's the limit.

501
00:35:29,260 --> 00:35:39,940
Thanks for watching!
