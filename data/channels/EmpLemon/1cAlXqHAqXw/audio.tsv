0	13100	What's the highest you've ever jumped?
13100	17140	For most of us, that number never exceeds more than a few feet, for the simple reason
17140	19980	that jumping off anything higher is terrifying.
19980	25620	Bazophobia, or the fear of falling, is a phobia inherent to humans and many species of animals.
25620	30060	In the visual cliff experiment, a vast majority of infants would not cross what appeared to
30060	31900	them as a steep drop.
31900	36260	The fear of falling appears to be ingrained into the very fiber of our being.
36260	41800	It's a sensation that's mutually understood by all, but somewhat difficult to articulate.
41800	45980	Statistically speaking, you're about a hundred times more likely to die in a car accident
45980	52100	than a plane crash, yet most of us undoubtedly find flying much more terrifying than driving.
52100	53780	So why is this the case?
53780	56900	Well for me, the answer lies in the element of control.
56900	60860	If you're driving and something goes wrong, you at least feel like you have some input
60860	62480	over your own destiny.
62480	67380	If something goes wrong on a plane, well, you're just along for the ride.
67380	70940	There's a certainty to falling that's impossible to deny.
70940	75240	Once you step over the edge, you become nothing more than an object in motion.
75240	80020	Your status, wealth, athleticism, intellect, none of it matters at that point.
80020	84420	You have surrendered yourself to the complete mercy of nature and the unbreakable laws that
84420	85820	govern it.
85820	90080	In works of fiction, great falls are used to represent finality.
90080	93580	Characters are often allowed to cheat death in all sorts of ways, but once you fall into
93580	96260	the bottomless pit, it's game over.
96260	99140	There's something so absolute about its outcome.
99140	102260	To question it would be to question one's own sanity.
102260	106980	Only a madman would intentionally step off the platform of unfathomable heights.
106980	111560	And yet, in the visual cliff experiment, a few infants would crawl over the cliff completely
111560	112660	unfazed.
112660	116800	Possibly because they had not yet developed depth perception, but perhaps they grew up
116800	121360	to be the very people who override billions of years of evolutionary programming to defy
121360	124200	the most fundamental fear of man.
124200	127300	This is the story of The World's Highest Jump.
136980	153260	The jump I made here was about a meter, or around three feet in height.
153260	157340	It's a jump I'm sure most of you would have no problem making as well, but how much higher
157340	161200	could you go without hurting yourself in a basic jump like this?
161200	167180	In Minecraft, a fall of four blocks or higher will make you take damage.
167180	172500	A fall of 23 and a half blocks is fatal.
172500	177960	In reality, the farthest you can safely fall onto a hard surface is around 10 to 12 feet.
177960	181360	Higher than that and you're likely to walk away with minor injuries.
181360	186120	When the Undertaker threw Mick Foley off the top of the cell at King of the Ring 98, Foley
186120	190760	plummeted at least 16 feet, dislocating his shoulder in the process.
190760	195200	A fall of 20 feet or higher will most likely result in serious injuries.
195200	199440	And beyond 100 feet, a fall is considered unsurvivable.
199440	203400	There's a common misconception that landing in water will break your fall, but due to
203400	207800	surface tension, the only thing you'll be breaking is most of your bones.
207800	211920	Landing in water from 100 feet is equivalent to landing on concrete.
211920	216340	Surviving any fall greater than that is exceedingly rare without protective equipment.
216340	220420	But for the vast majority of human history, all people had to brace themselves with their
220420	221900	arms and legs.
221900	226180	Naturally, this meant that any early attempts at the world's highest jump were almost certainly
226180	228180	done so involuntarily.
228180	232980	The first unsung record holders of this category may have earned their title by accident, by
232980	235720	force, or by a failed attempt to end their life.
235720	240320	But if someone in prehistoric times did want to make the jump of a lifetime, how far could
240320	241660	they possibly fall?
241660	246220	Well, in the age before aircraft, all people had to lift themselves was the terrain of
246220	247580	the Earth itself.
247820	252220	Mount Everest is the tallest point on Earth, but its slope would prematurely stop you long
252220	253980	before you reach the bottom.
253980	258300	For a continuous, uninterrupted fall, you would have to jump from the world's tallest
258300	259300	cliff.
259300	265180	For a purely vertical drop, Mount Thor in Canada has a prominence of over 4,100 feet.
265180	269100	While highly unlikely, it's theoretically possible that somebody could have jumped from
269100	270100	this height.
270100	274340	However, in an age before written history, no one can say for sure.
274340	278780	For the first recording of anyone jumping off anything, we have to venture closer to
278780	280660	the stone mountains of China.
283880	286540	As far as we know, this event may have never happened.
286540	290900	The only information on it was written by a guy 2,000 years before our time, about a
290900	293660	guy 2,000 years before his time.
293660	298200	As the legend goes, Emperor Shun escaped the roof of a burning barn by gliding off using
298200	300420	his hat to slow his descent.
300420	305020	By my estimate, the jump was probably done from the equivalent of a two-story building,
305020	306700	or about 20 feet.
306700	309740	It may not sound like much, but this was significant.
309740	314620	It's the earliest recorded instance of anyone jumping with intent rather than falling by
314620	315980	mistake.
315980	320920	All future jumps would be successors to Shun's 20-foot leap off the burning barn.
320920	325820	The ancient Chinese were one of the first civilizations to experiment with aeronautics.
325820	331740	As early as 200 BC, acrobats would use bamboo shoots to perform falling stunts at the Imperial
331740	332800	Palace.
332800	337520	By 500 AD, kites had become commonplace in Chinese society.
337520	341700	Some kite designs had become aerodynamic enough to support the weight of a man.
341700	347020	In 559, Yuan Huang-tou was one of several prisoners ordered to be executed by gliding
347020	349740	off the 108-foot tall Phoenix Tower.
349740	354820	Remarkably, Yuan survived, claiming the unofficial jump record in the process.
354820	357980	For his achievement, Yuan was executed anyway.
357980	362540	Despite his grim fate, the record would remain alive for more than a thousand years.
362540	367100	The next great leap in aeronautical innovation came during the Italian Renaissance.
367100	371540	Leonardo da Vinci is often credited with the invention of the parachute, but an even earlier
371540	376100	concept can be traced back to 1470 from an anonymous manuscript.
376100	383740	In 1615, Fausto Veranzio improved upon Leonardo's design, but so far, the parachute only existed
383740	384740	in concept.
384740	389220	It wasn't until the 18th century that the parachute was brought into reality.
389220	393880	Louis Sebastian Lenerman would design and manufacture the first modern parachute.
393880	399620	On December 26, 1783, Lenerman would record the first parachute jump in history by jumping
399620	403180	from the upper balcony of the Montpellier Observatory.
403180	408360	That very same year, just 120 miles away in Annonay, the Montgolfier brothers would develop
408360	410140	the first hot air balloon.
410140	414940	Within the span of a few months, mankind had not only broken free from Earth's terrain,
414940	418240	but found a way to weaken the grip of gravity itself.
418240	425660	And it was only a matter of time before someone would use both to make history.
425660	432820	On October 22, 1797, Andre Garnerin became the first person to parachute out of an aircraft.
432820	437900	Garnerin rose to 3,200 feet in a hot air balloon, then severed the basket, parachuting back
437900	439580	down unharmed.
439580	443860	You could argue that this wasn't a true jump, as Garnerin never actually stepped out
443860	445560	of the balloon's basket.
445560	449740	But based on the illustrations of the basket's design, I would say that it serves little
449740	454620	purpose in actually protecting the user, and rather functions as a necessary component
454620	456540	of the parachute itself.
456540	460980	The important thing is that Andre Garnerin flew about 500 feet higher than the top of
460980	466100	the Burj Khalifa, then severed his only means of flotation, placing full faith in the thin
466100	470620	fabric above his head to ensure that he didn't wind up becoming a human crepe.
470620	476140	On that day in 1797, Andre Garnerin became the first skydiver.
476140	480060	Just five years later, he would set a new all-time record, jumping from a height of
480060	481780	8,000 feet.
481780	486280	Garnerin's aerial heroics would inspire a new generation of daredevils who would replicate
486280	489740	his death-defying stunt in front of spectators around the world.
489740	494560	19th century parachuters would draw crowds at local carnivals and other venues by dropping
494560	498020	out of the sky from altitudes of 2 to 5,000 feet.
498020	502520	This range is comparable to the cruising altitude of the Fortnite battle bus, and while the
502520	506900	stunts looked death-defying, sometimes death would not be defied.
506900	512560	In 1837, Robert Cocking earned the grim distinction of becoming the first skydiving fatality after
512560	515460	his parachute failed at 5,000 feet.
515460	519440	Cocking was supposedly attempting to reach the 8,000-foot mark that Garnerin had set
519440	523240	decades prior, but the record would not be undone.
523280	527360	The use of Cocking's death was a sobering reminder to the dangers of falling from thousands
527360	532760	of feet in the air, and it extinguished the popularity of parachuting for decades afterwards.
532760	537960	For the rest of the 1800s, there were no jump attempts on record surpassing Garnerin's
537960	539260	8,000-foot mark.
539260	543720	This was mostly due to the limitations of parachutes, as balloons continued to soar
543720	545760	throughout the 19th century.
545760	550280	Since would-be jumpers were no longer encumbered by the earth's terrain, the highest theoretical
550320	554320	jump was now determined by the balloon altitude record.
559960	564760	Even at this time, unmanned balloons could easily rise to tens of thousands of feet,
564760	569040	but manned flights now had to deal with the limits of human physiology.
569040	574980	Above 15,000 feet, most people will begin to suffer the effects of oxygen deprivation.
574980	579360	Most modern-day skydiving excursions will not fly above this altitude for that very
579360	580560	reason.
580560	585940	Above 26,000 feet is the Death Zone, the limit beyond which the human body can no longer
585940	588720	survive without supplemental oxygen.
588720	593960	In 1862, James Glacier and Henry Cockswell became the first people to surpass the Death
593960	594960	Zone.
594960	600280	At around 29,000 feet, the pair lost consciousness, with Cockswell barely managing to pull the
600280	602960	balloon's valve cord before blacking out.
602960	607360	The pair survived when the balloon rapidly descended back to a safe height, but not before
607360	612800	setting a new altitude record estimated between 29,000 and 37,000 feet.
612800	618680	By 1887, oxygen tanks became commercially available, allowing ballooners to safely enter
618680	620120	the Death Zone.
620120	625960	In 1901, Arthur Burson and Reinhard Sühring set an official record of 35,000 feet in a
625960	630200	hydrogen balloon, this time remaining conscious to record it.
630200	635940	In 1927, Hawthorne Gray became the first person to pass the 40,000-foot mark, but perished
635940	637860	after running out of oxygen.
637860	643840	In 1931, August Picard and Paul Kipfer passed the 50,000-foot mark, becoming the first people
643840	647860	to enter the stratosphere, as well as the first people to truly witness the curvature
647860	648860	of the Earth.
648860	653680	In 1933, at the Century of Progress World Fair, Thomas Settle and Chester Fordney would
653680	655800	surpass 60,000 feet.
655800	659620	By this point, record attempts were quickly approaching the next hard limit in manned
659620	661120	balloon flights.
661120	666760	As altitude increases, air pressure decreases, as does the boiling point of fluids.
666760	671200	At around 60,000 feet, air pressure is low enough where the temperature of your body
671200	676400	will exceed the boiling point of water, causing your blood to literally boil.
676400	680860	This limit is otherwise known as the Armstrong Line, and future flights above it would require
680860	682740	a pressurized suit.
682740	687860	In 1934, the Soviet Union's Osevayikin-1 surpassed the Armstrong Line and reached a
687860	693320	peak altitude of 72,000 feet before the balloon disintegrated during its descent, killing
693320	695060	all three crew members.
695060	699440	One year later, in what would be a precursor to the Space Race, the United States took
699440	705340	back the record when Albert Stevens and Orville Anderson reached 72,400 feet in the Explorer
705340	706540	II craft.
706540	710300	By this point, balloon flight progression had provided the jump record with massive
710300	714860	potential for improvement, but before anyone could attempt a new record, the parachute
714860	723160	would have to rise to the occasion.
723160	727580	The turn of the 20th century saw two tremendous strides in aeronautics, with the invention
727580	729860	of the airplane and the airship.
729860	734220	The unprecedented boom in air travel renewed interest in the parachute.
734220	739420	In 1907, aerial stuntman Charles Brodwick would provide the first major parachute innovation
739420	743620	with a static line, which allowed the chute to automatically deploy when jumping out of
743620	745040	an aircraft.
745040	749940	In 1914, Brodwick's adopted daughter Tiny became the first person to manually deploy
749940	754580	a chute while in freefall, eventually leading to the invention of the ripcord.
754580	760500	And starting in 1919, Leslie Ervin began manufacturing and distributing the Type A parachute for
760500	763100	use as life preservers on airplanes.
763100	767120	The Ervin chute would revitalize the pastime of stunt jumping.
767120	771540	Just as the balloon jumpers would perform death-defying jumps a century earlier, a new
771540	777540	generation of aerial acrobats would wow spectators by jumping from the cockpits of their airplanes.
777540	782060	This new wave of daredevils became known as the Barnstormers, the most famous of which
782060	785020	was a man by the name of Charles Lindbergh.
785020	789320	Lindbergh was most known for making the first non-stop transatlantic flight, but buried
789320	793860	among his long list of aviation accomplishments was the new record for the world's highest
793860	794860	jump.
794860	800220	In 1926, Lindbergh used an Ervin chute to bail out of his plane at an altitude of 13,000
800220	804300	feet, finally breaking Garnerin's record after more than a century.
804300	809820	1927 saw the first tests of parachutes in military combat, leading to the rise of the
809820	810820	paratrooper.
810820	816380	In 1943, U.S. Army surgeon Randy Lovelace became the first person on record to jump
816380	817860	from the stratosphere.
817860	823240	In an Air Force experiment, Lovelace bailed out of an army bomber at over 40,000 feet.
823240	827740	The force of the parachute knocked him unconscious, and the minus 40 degree temperatures left
827740	829300	his hands frostbitten.
829300	833900	But Lovelace survived the jump by the skin of his teeth, claiming the record in the process.
833900	838420	The first ever jump from the stratosphere would be the last with a conventional parachute,
838420	840400	at least in the United States.
840400	845280	Soviet jumpers Vasily Romanuk and Nikolai Nikitin would both set higher marks, with
845280	849800	Nikitin surpassing 47,000 feet in 1957.
849800	855300	While the Russians were fixated on the record itself, the U.S. directed their focus to survival.
855300	859580	If pilots were to survive ejecting at very high altitudes, they would need to be equipped
859580	862220	with parachutes fit for the edge of space.
862220	867420	Randy Lovelace's near-fatal jump would usher in a new era, the dawn of the space jump.
875420	877020	I'm going to jump!
877020	878020	No!
878020	881020	Do a flip!
881020	887780	Patients of YouTube, it is I, Dr. Spiral, standing here atop this three-story structure.
887780	893260	Now in my medical opinion, I would say that it's unsafe to fall from this height.
893260	896380	I mean, a fall from this height can make your hair fall out.
896380	899980	Skydivers can fall faster than 120 miles per hour.
899980	902860	In those conditions, your hair won't last long.
902860	906860	That's why if you're planning to jump off anything, I recommend using Keeps Hair Loss
906860	908540	Prevention first.
908540	913020	Keeps is the most affordable FDA-approved hair loss product, and you can visit an online

916540	922260	Now, to demonstrate Keeps' 90% effectiveness at treating and reducing the symptoms of hair
922260	926540	loss, I will jump off this three-story structure right now!
930540	931540	Oh!
931540	932540	Oh!
932540	933540	Oh my gosh!
933540	934540	Wow!
934540	937220	I really just fell from all the way up there!
937220	939220	Keeps kept my hair safe!
939220	940540	My hair...
940540	943520	It's game over for hair loss!

956260	961300	Scientifically speaking, outer space doesn't begin until the Karman line, more than 300,000
961300	962300	feet high.
962300	967660	The region between it and the Armstrong line is classified as near space, and as jet planes
967660	973180	flew higher, pilots would need a new kind of parachute to safely eject from this range.
973180	978500	Following Randy Loveless' near-fatal jump, the Air Force began testing experimental high-altitude
978500	980420	parachutes on dummies.
980420	984100	Early designs would force the dummies into an uncontrollable flat spin that would be
984100	986780	potentially fatal on human subjects.
986780	991940	By 1958, they were ready to test out a new multi-stage design that was intended to stabilize
991940	993220	the jumper.
993220	998580	Only this time, the test would be conducted on a human being, an unenviable task bestowed
998580	1000780	upon Captain Joseph Kittinger.
1006300	1010080	Kittinger had already proven himself as the Air Force's new favorite guinea pig with
1010080	1016440	his role in Project Manhigh, a 1957 research assignment that saw Kittinger soar 96,000
1016440	1020460	feet in a balloon, setting a new altitude record in the process.
1020500	1025200	His next assignment would be Project Excelsior, where Kittinger would once again rise to the
1025200	1029500	stratosphere in a balloon, only this time he would have to jump out.
1029500	1035960	On November 16, 1959, Kittinger fastened his pressure suit and boarded Excelsior 1, rising
1035960	1039400	to an altitude of 76,400 feet.
1039400	1044660	At that point, Kittinger unstrapped himself from the gondola and stepped over the edge.
1044660	1046580	Immediately there was a problem.
1046580	1050060	Kittinger had prematurely deployed his stabilization chute.
1050060	1053760	Just like the test dummies, Kittinger entered an uncontrollable spin.
1053760	1059200	At 120 rpm, Kittinger blacked out nearly 13 miles above the Earth.
1059200	1062700	He regained consciousness just 3,000 feet from the ground.
1062700	1067220	Miraculously, the rest of the chutes functioned according to plan, allowing Joe Kittinger
1067220	1070340	to escape with his life and a new record.
1070340	1074380	Despite a near disaster on the first run, Kittinger was determined to prove that the
1074380	1076540	new parachute system could work.
1076540	1081540	Less than a month later, Kittinger would return to the skies with Excelsior 2, jumping from
1081540	1083300	74,000 feet.
1083300	1087540	This time the parachutes functioned flawlessly, and although he was just shy of adding to
1087540	1092380	the record, he would get one more chance to make history in the summer of 1960.
1092380	1097260	On the morning of August 16, Kittinger boarded the gondola for Excelsior 3.
1097260	1101380	Sudden cloud cover almost canceled the mission before it started, but Kittinger launched
1101380	1104740	just one minute before the orders to cancel the flight.
1104740	1108680	Soon after, overcast skies would be the least of his concerns.
1108680	1113900	At about 50,000 feet, Kittinger realized that his right glove had failed to pressurize,
1113900	1116780	causing his hand to swell to twice its size.
1116780	1121980	Despite the potentially catastrophic complication, Kittinger did not inform the ground crew.
1121980	1125620	He knew that if he did, the mission would be immediately aborted.
1125620	1129660	Anticipating that they would never get another chance at a jump, Kittinger bit the bullet
1129660	1131560	and continued to rise.
1131560	1136300	About one hour and forty minutes after launch, Kittinger took the highest step in the world,
1136300	1139020	and jumped from the stratosphere for the final time.
1139020	1142780	Kittinger free-filled for four and a half minutes before deploying his main chute.
1142780	1146140	He reached a top speed of 614 miles per hour.
1146140	1150300	Thirteen minutes and forty-five seconds after stepping out of the gondola, Joe Kittinger
1150300	1152920	touched down in the New Mexico desert.
1152920	1154920	The ground crew was ecstatic.
1154920	1159540	Not only was Excelsior 3 a resounding success, but Kittinger had just landed from the highest
1159740	1161260	jump in history.
1161260	1163260	So just how high did Joe go?
1184260	1187320	102,800 feet.
1187320	1192000	Not only did Joe Kittinger set the all-time jump record, he did so while setting the all-time
1192000	1197780	balloon altitude record, the second highest altitude ever reached by man at that point.
1197780	1202440	After proving that humans could survive exposure to the upper atmosphere, Project Excelsior
1202440	1205840	would open the floodgates for manned space exploration.
1205840	1210460	Soon after, both the US and Soviet Union would send the first astronauts into orbit.
1210460	1213780	But in that moment, Kittinger stood farther from the Earth's surface than all but a
1213780	1217580	single person before him, and then jumped back down.
1217580	1221980	Years later while serving in Vietnam, Kittinger would be captured as a prisoner of war after
1221980	1223920	his plane was shot down.
1223920	1226420	One has to wonder which moment was more terrifying.
1230420	1235460	Remarkably, despite accomplishing one of the most impressive feats in the history of aviation,
1235460	1237720	Kittinger never actually cared about the record.
1237720	1242100	He took far more satisfaction in completing the mission and validating the effectiveness
1242100	1243980	of the high altitude parachute.
1243980	1247420	Ironically, the record would go on to define his legacy.
1247420	1252380	Before Joe Kittinger, the jump record only existed as a formality, a sloppy and poorly
1252380	1256700	documented patchwork of events consisting mostly of people who stumbled into the record
1256700	1258780	completely unintentionally.
1258780	1263620	In many ways, Kittinger was no different, but after Excelsior, the record would never
1263620	1264620	be the same.
1264620	1269260	It was the first time that the world's highest jump was documented, broadcasted, and celebrated
1269260	1270660	in the media.
1270720	1275520	Kittinger had effectively made the record tangible, and before long, a new wave of contenders
1275520	1277020	were lining up to break it.
1281020	1285420	Naturally, the first people to challenge for the American record were the Russians.
1285420	1290640	In 1962, Pyotr Dolgov and Yevgeny Andreyev were tasked with the Soviet Union's first
1290640	1292660	attempt at a space jump.
1292660	1298900	Andreyev successfully jumped from 83,000 feet, setting a new record for the longest freefall.
1298900	1304540	Dolgov jumped from nearly 94,000 feet, but perished after his suit depressurized.
1304540	1309460	Dolgov's death would be covered up for years, but as far as the Soviets were concerned,
1309460	1311660	the mission was a success.
1311660	1316300	Even though Joe Kittinger's record was well documented and precisely measured with state-of-the-art
1316300	1321820	technology, it wasn't verified by the FAI, allowing the Soviets to claim the official
1321820	1325100	record despite falling nearly 20,000 feet short.
1325100	1329420	For all intents and purposes, Joe Kittinger still held the record, but the Soviets had
1329420	1333740	the validation of a bureaucratic sanctioning body in Switzerland, and they were content
1333740	1334860	with that.
1334860	1339020	Not content with the disputed title was a young adventurer from New Jersey, Nicholas
1339020	1340100	Piantanita.
1344340	1348260	The young skydiver had been obsessed with jumping ever since his childhood, where he
1348260	1352100	would nearly fall to his death after jumping from the roof of his apartment with a makeshift
1352100	1354340	parachute made from his bedsheets.
1354340	1359500	By the 60s, Piantanita was determined to bring the undisputed record back to America by making
1359500	1361460	the greatest jump in history.
1361460	1365700	His goal was to break both Kittinger's altitude record and Andreyev's freefall record in
1365700	1368740	what would become known as Project Stratojump.
1368740	1373440	But unlike the space jumpers before him, Piantanita didn't have government backing.
1373440	1378300	He had to essentially create his own ragtag aeronautical research program from scratch,
1378300	1381740	using sponsors, volunteers, and borrowed facilities.
1381740	1386940	While preparing for the jump, Piantanita sought out consultation from Joe Kittinger himself.
1386940	1390580	Kittinger, never a fan of chasing records, refused.
1390580	1394660	He had nearly lost his life performing the feat just a few years prior, and he didn't
1394660	1399060	appreciate Piantanita's cavalier attitude towards the daunting challenge.
1399060	1403900	However, despite his barebones resources, Piantanita and the Strat-O team managed to
1403900	1407540	assemble a working balloon, gondola, and pressure suit.
1407540	1413060	By the autumn of 1965, Nick Piantanita was ready to take to the skies.
1413060	1418940	On October 22, Stratojump 1 lifted off from a field outside of St. Paul, Minnesota.
1418940	1423880	Unfortunately, high wind shear would destroy the balloon at just 16,000 feet, forcing an
1423880	1426560	emergency landing and a second attempt.
1426560	1430380	He would try again on February 2, 1966.
1430380	1434540	This time, the balloon had no problem reaching the stratosphere where it continued rising.
1434540	1442140	Soon, it had soared past Andreyev's mark of 80,000, then past Kittinger's mark of 102,000.
1442140	1448220	Piantanita's balloon topped out at an unprecedented height of 123,500 feet.
1448220	1450920	His unyielding hubris was about to pay off.
1450920	1453480	The record was tantalizingly close.
1453480	1462800	All Nick Piantanita had to do was step out of the gondola and into the record books.
1462800	1464260	But there was a problem.
1464260	1468940	The oxygen line tethering Piantanita to the gondola wouldn't detach, and he had no way
1468940	1470860	of severing the connection.
1470860	1475440	After several agonizing minutes at the edge of glory, the ground crew decided to abort
1475440	1476580	the mission.
1476580	1482480	In a turbulent and dangerous descent, a battered Piantanita returned to Earth with the gondola.
1482480	1486560	After the heartbreaking failure, Piantanita would not be deterred.
1486560	1493180	On May 1, 1966, he stepped back into the gondola with the goal of once again reaching the 120,000
1493180	1494300	foot mark.
1494300	1505820	This time, he would pay the ultimate price.
1505820	1510320	At 57,000 feet, Nick Piantanita's suit depressurized.
1510320	1515700	The ground crew immediately aborted the mission, but at that point, very little could be done.
1515700	1520500	Piantanita was starved of oxygen for more than 20 minutes, falling into a coma from
1520500	1522340	which he never recovered.
1522340	1527080	As close as he came to proving everyone wrong, Piantanita's recklessness would ultimately
1527080	1528620	cost him everything.
1528620	1533800	He met a cruelly fitting fate, spending his final moments in the sky, the place he always
1533800	1538640	seemed to belong.
1538640	1543100	The stratojump catastrophe would mark the end of record attempts for a while.
1543100	1548260	Neither of the two world superpowers were interested in balloon jump escapades anymore.
1548260	1551200	They had moved on to new frontiers.
1551200	1555400	Later record holders would have to independently direct their own operations.
1555400	1560020	After progressing through millennia of physical barriers to the sky, the newest limitations
1560020	1563420	to the jump record were now cost and ambition.
1563420	1568400	The 60s had quickly become the age of the astronaut, and the boom in space exploration
1568400	1572400	had taken much of the luster off the once vaunted space jump.
1572400	1576900	It seemed that the only notable jumps of this era happened by complete chance.
1576900	1582940	In 1966, American pilot Bill Weaver would survive a 78,000 foot fall after ejecting
1582940	1584960	from a jet at Mach 3.
1584960	1589040	His life would be spared thanks to the same parachute design that Joe Kittinger had tested
1589040	1591020	just six years prior.
1591020	1597800	In 1971, DB Cooper became the first and only person to successfully commit airplane piracy,
1597800	1602340	parachuting an estimated 10,000 feet with $200,000 in ransom money.
1602340	1607860	In 1973, Serbian flight attendant Vensa Vulovic survived the highest fall on record without
1607860	1612580	a parachute after the plane she was servicing exploded at 33,000 feet.
1612580	1618300	And in 1982, Larry Walter survived an ascent to 16,000 feet after tying dozens of weather
1618300	1620220	balloons to a lawn chair.
1620220	1624700	The next attempt at the world's highest jump wouldn't happen until the 90s with decorated
1624700	1627240	British paratrooper Nish Bruce.
1627240	1631740	Starting in the early 90s, Bruce began training for the eventual Skydive from Space project
1631740	1635260	where he would make a planned jump from 130,000 feet.
1635260	1639700	The project was partially funded by NASA, who wanted to test the effects of radiation
1639700	1641420	at high altitudes.
1641420	1646580	Despite an encouraging start, the project would abruptly end in 1994 when Bruce suffered
1646580	1651120	an unexpected mental breakdown, stabbing his girlfriend with a pair of scissors.
1651120	1655300	The incident would mark the beginning of Bruce's eight-year-long battle with mental illness,
1655300	1657900	a battle he would eventually lose.
1657900	1662320	In 2002, Nish Bruce would end his life by intentionally jumping from a plane without
1662320	1663740	a parachute.
1663740	1668780	Much like Nick Piantanita, Nish Bruce was someone who seemed to belong to the sky, this
1668780	1680380	time going out on his own terms.
1680380	1685380	After four decades of magnificent failure since Project Excelsior, the new millennium
1685380	1689100	would bring a new wave of contenders trying to beat the record.
1689100	1694260	Starting in 2000, Cheryl Stearns would announce her plans to jump from 130,000 feet with the
1694260	1696980	formation of the StratoQuest project.
1696980	1702060	Stearns was the most accomplished female skydiver in history and was prepared to make the ultimate
1702060	1704460	jump in the spring of 2001.
1704460	1708620	Unfortunately, StratoQuest could never quite materialize.
1708620	1713220	After numerous delays and funding issues, the project had fallen defunct by the end of
1713220	1714220	the 2000s.
1714620	1719860	An Australian man, Rod Milner, announced that next March, he plans to skydive from 25 miles
1719860	1725260	above the Earth, reaching speeds over a thousand miles an hour and breaking the sound barrier.
1725260	1730580	In 2001, Australian skydiver Rod Milner would make waves in the media by announcing his
1730580	1735340	plan to jump from 130,000 feet and break the sound barrier with his fall.
1735340	1740260	The mission, titled Project Space Jump, had reportedly secured funding from the Australian
1740260	1744900	Defence Force Academy with plans to launch a year later in March 2002.
1744900	1749540	Well, a year came and went and no jump was ever attempted.
1749540	1754420	Following the initial media hype, Project Space Jump was never discussed again and eventually
1754420	1759620	forgotten, coming off much more like a publicity stunt than an actual attempt at the record.
1759620	1765300	In 2003, French adventurer Michel Fournier announced Les Grand Sau, during which he planned
1765300	1767900	to jump from 130,000 feet.
1767900	1772140	Fournier made the most progress of anyone in the decade, managing to produce a working
1772140	1774420	balloon, pressure suit, and gondola.
1774420	1779620	Unfortunately, all of Fournier's attempts would be aborted before they could even launch.
1779620	1784380	After spending two decades and nearly 20 million dollars chasing the record, Michel Fournier
1784380	1786420	couldn't even get off the ground.
1786420	1791180	2010 would mark the 50-year anniversary of Joe Kittinger's record, and after half a
1791180	1795300	century of failure, many began to wonder whether anyone could break it.
1798900	1804100	Starting in 2010, Red Bull would sponsor the Stratos project and team up with Austrian
1804100	1809020	skydiver Felix Baumgartner to finally top Kittinger's record once and for all.
1809020	1812940	Preparing Felix for the jump would be none other than Joe Kittinger himself.
1812940	1817300	Kittinger's blessings seemed to ward off the demons that had plagued all other attempts
1817300	1818940	since he set the record.
1818940	1823540	In March 2012, Baumgartner would successfully complete the project's first test jump from
1823540	1825220	71,000 feet.
1825220	1830300	In July, he would complete the second test jump, this time from 96,000 feet.
1830300	1836100	And finally, on October 14, 2012, Felix Baumgartner was ready to make history in a moment streamed
1836100	1838100	live around the world.
1855220	1873420	After finally having his record broken, Joe Kittinger never looked happier.
1873420	1878620	After 52 years of frustration, there was finally a new record holder of the world's highest
1878620	1879620	jump.
1879620	1883260	In addition to setting the altitude record, Felix Baumgartner became the first jumper
1883260	1887300	in history to break the sound barrier in his freefall, as well as setting the record
1887300	1889860	for the longest distance in freefall.
1889860	1894660	The YouTube livestream was watched by nearly 10 million viewers, a record that itself would
1894660	1896740	stand for almost six years.
1896740	1901700	The new record provided a rare moment of inspiration for a generation who had very little to celebrate
1901700	1903780	in terms of aeronautical achievement.
1903780	1906680	Truly, it was a jump for the ages.
1906680	1911500	After taking half a century to be Kittinger's mark of 102,000, who knew how long it would
1911500	1918720	take to beat Baumgartner, the record would stand for two years.
1918720	1924860	On October 24, 2014, computer scientist Alan Eustace would set a new altitude record of
1924860	1928180	135,889 feet.
1928180	1933300	Eustace worked as the senior VP of engineering at Google and had no prior history of skydiving
1933300	1934940	or extreme stunts.
1934940	1939300	One day he decided that he wanted to pursue the record, so he assembled a team of collaborators
1939300	1940900	to form Stratex.
1940900	1945500	Eustace became the first jumper in history to ascend to the stratosphere without a gondola,
1945500	1949700	relying only on a pressure suit to protect him from the vacuum of near space.
1949700	1954180	The reduction in weight allowed him to soar more than 8,000 feet higher than Baumgartner's
1954180	1955180	mark.
1955180	1959300	In just a single attempt at the record, Alan Eustace went up and got it.
1959300	1962460	That's where the record stands today, but where does it go from here?
1962460	1968060	Well, the record for the highest unmanned balloon flight is 173,900 feet.
1968180	1972660	Fighter weight missions like Stratex may approach this altitude, but sooner or later, jumpers
1972660	1976220	will reach another hard limit, the mesosphere.
1976220	1981500	Starting at around 170,000 feet, the air becomes thin enough to force any balloon to burst
1981500	1983260	from the pressure difference.
1983260	1988180	As a result, the mesosphere is the least explored part of the atmosphere, extending too high
1988180	1991140	for balloons and too low for satellites.
1991140	1995420	But what if you were to skip the mesosphere entirely and jump from a satellite?
1995420	1999540	The International Space Station orbits in the thermosphere at an average altitude of
1999540	2004540	about 1.3 million feet, nearly 10 times the height of the current record.
2004540	2009660	However, since the ISS is in orbit, it's traveling about 10 times faster than an average
2009660	2010740	bullet.
2010740	2015580	Re-entering the atmosphere at that speed will cause the human body to burn up like a meteor.
2015580	2019860	Currently, the best hope for space jumps beyond the stratosphere may be Virgin Galactic's
2019860	2025740	SpaceShipTwo, a suborbital space plane capable of surpassing the 300,000-foot mark.
2025740	2030260	Due to the parabolic shape of the flight path, it could be theoretically possible to jump
2030260	2033100	from the peak without extreme exit velocity.
2033100	2037800	Virgin Galactic plans to launch commercial flights on the space plane starting this decade,
2037800	2042620	so it's possible that the next great stride in space jumping may be just a few years away.
2042620	2046580	For now, the record stands at just under 136,000 feet.
2046580	2051280	No matter the era, death-defying jumps have never failed to amaze and inspire those who
2051280	2052660	witness them.
2052660	2060540	Space jumping is both a product and an example of our endless thirst for progress.
2060540	2065660	Sixty years ago as Joe Kittinger gazed down at the Earth prior to his record-setting jump,
2065660	2070060	he remarked at the irony of such beauty existing in such deadly conditions.
2070060	2074860	He compared floating through the stratosphere to being enveloped in an ocean of cyanide.
2074860	2079500	Despite literally being on top of the world, Kittinger was overcome with an overwhelming
2079500	2084340	sense of humility.
2084340	2090160	We defy nature by venturing higher and higher, and nature humbles us with its unconquerable
2090160	2091620	vastness.
2091620	2096800	After 4,000 years of trying, we have already managed to jump from unfathomable heights,
2096800	2099260	but we still have so much farther to go.
