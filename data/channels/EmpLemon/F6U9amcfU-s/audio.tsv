5520	10560	Hello, Your Honor. As you can see, I've decided to make a video essay in place of a written essay.
11120	16480	Generally speaking, kids are dumb. They tend to not know anything about anything,
16480	21760	and very few of them have any skills that can be considered even somewhat valuable to society.
22320	27520	Being an adult is better in just about every conceivable way. But despite our overwhelming
27520	35520	advantages, there's one aspect where kids have us absolutely beat. In 1972, British progressive
35520	41520	rock band Jethro Tull released their fifth studio album, Thick as a Brick, an epic tale told through
41520	47520	the ambitious format of one continuous piece of music. Front man Ian Anderson credited the
47520	52720	fantastical lyrics of the composition to an eight-year-old boy named Gerald Bostic.
52720	57520	The album was so imaginative it made sense to many that it could only have come from the wild
57520	65520	mind of a child. When it comes to creativity, kids are king. And 20 years ago, one show helped many
65520	78160	of us channel our inner eight-year-old. 1999 was a landmark time for American animation. The year
78160	83600	introduced us to some of the most influential cartoons of the 21st century, but lost among
83600	89600	the titans of its era was a series that received far less fanfare. Home Movies was a largely
89600	96320	forgotten show that debuted on a largely forgotten network. UPN was Viacom's awkward attempt to
96320	102400	establish a new broadcast network on American television. Across its 11 years of operation,
102400	108080	it struggled to even make a dent on mainstream culture. If you were watching American television
108080	116480	in the 90s, you probably weren't watching UPN. In 1999, the six major networks broadcast 164
116480	123600	unique shows on the air. Arranged by viewership, UPN aired 22 of the 25 least watched shows of the
123600	130240	year. And second from the very bottom of the list was the subject of today's video. Home Movies
130240	136800	premiered on April 26, 1999 to historically low ratings, the worst the network had ever seen in
136800	143760	its time slot. Just 30 days later, UPN pulled the plug and canceled the show after only five
143760	149280	episodes. During its brief stint, the series received generally unfavorable reviews from
149280	154880	critics. The launch was one of the most disastrous in the history of television, and it's not hard to
154880	160240	see why the 90s audience weren't exactly crazy about the new cartoon. Pretty much everything
160240	166400	about the show was unorthodox. The art style was crude and childlike. The series was animated using
166400	171200	the incredibly niche technique of squiggle vision, which some viewers found hard to watch.
171760	176160	The show's dialogue was almost completely improvised, which was practically unheard
176160	181760	of for any other animated program at the time. The comedy was subtle and understated in an era
181760	187040	of bombastic in-your-face humor. It was a show that looked like a Newgrounds animation and
187040	192960	sounded like a podcast. Needless to say, Home Movies was unlike anything else in its era,
192960	198640	and hardly anyone was willing to watch something so different. However, not every series needs to
198640	203840	be loved by millions of people. Sometimes all a show has to do is impress just one.
204640	209760	During its short run, Home Movies managed to pick up one important fan in Khaki Jones,
209760	214960	an executive at Cartoon Network. She loved the show so much that she convinced the network to
214960	221280	renew Home Movies for three more seasons. On September 2, 2001, Home Movies would
221280	226960	re-debut as the very first program on Cartoon Network's brand new animation block Adult Swim.
226960	231440	Now loosely scripted and flash animated, the show had turned over a new leaf.
232000	237120	And gradually, over several years, audiences finally began to warm up to it.
237120	242160	The series has since developed a cult following and has been critically reassessed as one of the
242160	248640	best cartoons of its era. So how exactly did Home Movies age so well? On its surface, it's a
248640	254160	relatively simple show about the trivialities of childhood. But where the series truly shines is
254160	259600	through its meta-contextual significance. Home Movies has possibly the most to say of any show
259600	264880	about the nature of the creative process. This is crazy, but maybe you might be working a little
264880	273040	too much on your films. That's what people say, but... Creativity is a concept that has always
273040	278240	been somewhat enigmatic to us. The ancient Greeks did not have any words in their language
278240	284320	corresponding to the idea of people as creators. For centuries, philosophers did not consider art
284320	289200	to be creative, positing that the role of an artist was to simply interpret what was already
289200	296000	provided by nature. In the Middle Ages, creativity was heavily intertwined with religion, and artistic
296000	301840	spontaneity was attributed to flashes of divine inspiration. It was only during the Renaissance
301840	306880	when philosophers began to consider that human beings were capable of producing creative works
306880	312320	on their own volition. Soon enough, creative work had become a legitimate profession.
312320	317840	Artists achieved worldwide fame for their unmatched ability to bring their imagination to life.
317840	323120	By the 20th century, creative works laid the foundation for billion-dollar industries.
323120	327680	Entertainment media eventually became so inescapable that the tools of the trade became
327680	333600	accessible to just about anybody, setting up the premise of Home Movies. The story of a boy and his
333600	339520	camera. Throughout the show, we get to experience the adventures and misadventures of Brendan Small,
339520	345520	who makes movies with his friends Jason and Melissa. Brendan's parents have recently divorced,
345520	350240	and filmmaking provides him with a much needed escape from a turbulent period in his life.
350880	356160	Although his movies are far from the best, he's not afraid to keep trying. The character of
356160	362320	Brendan Small is a not-so-subtle nod to series co-creator Brendan Small. Home Movies presents
362320	367840	a rather unique symmetry between its creators and characters. The essential conflict portrayed
367840	374000	within the show parallels the external conflict experienced by the show. Home Movies was not a
374000	379600	show for everyone, as evidenced by how few people actually watched it while it was on the air.
379600	383920	Those who enjoyed it likely related to the characters based on their own creative and
383920	390320	personal struggles. Brendan is a 21st century Charlie Brown. He's a natural underdog, grappling
390320	396240	with the unfairness of a world beyond his control. Within the show, Brendan's movies are not exactly
396240	401520	the pinnacle of filmmaking. They are often riddled with technical errors and general sloppiness
401520	406480	befitting of a novice who's figuring things out as they go along. But even though his movies may
406480	412800	appear crude, they are far from aimless. Brendan takes his filmmaking very seriously, more so than
412800	419360	pretty much anything else in his life. He sees his ability to make movies as his defining attribute.
419360	424160	It's easy for us to dismiss children's activities as inherently goofy and frivolous,
424160	430000	but Brendan's artistic endeavors are far more meaningful. Nothing he creates is arbitrary. Each
430000	436560	one of his movies has a clear vision, even if his ability to execute may be lacking. Brendan's plight
436560	441840	is something experienced by all creative people at one point or another. No matter how brilliant
441840	447040	our vision may be, we're always caught in a tug of war between imagination and feasibility.
447760	452160	Home Movies offers a powerful commentary on the barriers to creative fulfillment.
458240	463120	Our society has a somewhat paradoxical relationship with creative works.
463120	468320	The most illustrious artists, musicians, and movie stars are often among the most revered people in
468320	474480	the world. We each dedicate a significant amount of our free time engaging with creatively motivated
474480	479760	products like film, music, and video games. Nearly all of us would agree that these things
479760	485120	vastly improve our quality of life. However, despite how much we enjoy the fruits of our
485120	490640	most successful creators, modern society is generally unforgiving to the process it takes
490640	496480	to get there. For as much as powerful institutions like Dispout platitudes about the importance of
496480	502000	creativity, the fact of the matter is that our society is not very welcoming to creative people.
502800	508400	Creative ideas are inherently risky. Each innovative new solution is usually preceded by
508400	514160	a dozen failures. It's for this reason why the vast majority of jobs in the economy don't value
514160	520400	creativity as a skill. There's no need to reinvent the wheel if the wheel itself is good enough.
520400	525520	When most jobs can be accomplished by mindlessly rehearsing an already proven formula,
525520	531360	the ability to think creatively is worthless. This is why artists who haven't hauled in gazillions in
531360	537120	revenue don't tend to receive much prestige. Without impressive dollar amounts to show for it,
537120	542400	the value of creativity is intangible, which for the average person might as well be nothing.
543120	548400	Because of their perceived lack of value, creative people often find themselves being overlooked,
548400	553840	invalidated, or even stigmatized for their ambitions. It's an attitude all too familiar
553840	560000	to the creators of home movies. Back in 1999, Brendan Small and Lorne Bouchard were too young
560000	565360	and unproven minds looking to make something truly distinct and avant-garde. The resulting
565360	570080	project nearly ended up costing them a rare opportunity as success in the entertainment
570080	575440	industry. Both creators would eventually go on to have long and successful careers,
575440	580960	but if it weren't for a chance rescue from a lone network executive, their creative contributions
580960	586240	may have never had a chance to flourish. It's easy to recognize their skill in hindsight,
586240	590880	but were they really any less talented 22 years ago when their grand artistic vision
590880	607520	was canceled after just five episodes? It's often difficult for us to evaluate whether any given
607520	612800	creative project will be successful. Bigwig Entertainment executives have the resources
612800	618000	to create anything they want, and most of it usually ends up sucking. Of course,
618000	623120	these people aren't fools. Somewhere along the way, the entertainment industry figured out that
623120	628880	movies and TV shows don't have to be good to make a boatload of cash. It's completely logical for
628880	634240	media moguls to invest their money in the 10,000 superhero reboot versus an unproven original
634240	639840	concept. The problem is that once all the money is made and enough time has passed, the product
639840	646480	that remains is not very inspiring. Logic is often antithetical to creativity, and creativity
646480	658000	is often antithetical to profitability. There's a reason why the most critically acclaimed art
658000	663600	tends to be the most niche. Truly great works are never meant to please everyone. The strength of
663600	668960	art lies in its power to alienate. If you want to see something new and innovative, it's going to
668960	674480	have to be a little alien. Prioritizing mass appeal and financial gain misses the point of
674480	680000	creation entirely. Historically, the greatest art has almost always come from people who have had
680000	686000	nothing to lose and no one to impress. By removing ourselves from the expectations and limitations
686000	692400	of others, we become truly free to pursue our vision. Creativity may be the ultimate exercise
692400	697600	in autonomy. It's an activity through which we have complete control over our domain.
698240	703760	Mastering the creative process requires overcoming one's limitations while retaining as much autonomy
703760	709600	as possible. Home Movies is a passion project, let's say, in that we fight for the things that
709600	715520	we think the show should be always. Both Brendan's movies and the show that encompasses them were
715520	721360	heavily limited in budget and manpower, but found a way to make the most of what they had. We can
721360	726640	still find them endearing because there's never any question of who's in creative control. Home
726640	732000	Movies may not be the most polished product, but it's charming in the way it allows the personality
732000	737920	of its creators to shine through. Art is ultimately a metaphysical extension of the self,
737920	744000	meaning that just like us, it's dynamic. In a long-term creative project like a TV show,
744000	749920	it's intriguing to watch it evolve along with its creators. In Home Movies, there's a tangible sense
749920	755040	of progression through the seasons. The creators get more confident in their storytelling, the
755040	760400	writing becomes more sophisticated, the actors really start to settle into their characters,
760400	765600	even the animation noticeably improves as the show's animators develop their techniques.
765600	772560	When given the space to do so, art can come alive. Home Movies was fortunate to wind up on what was
772560	778000	the perfect destination for creative liberty. Adult Swim was the first television studio to
778000	784080	truly embrace experimental creator-driven content. Tragically, the vast majority of commercial
784080	789120	artists are given nowhere near as much freedom over their creative destiny. Perhaps the most
789120	793920	difficult constraint any creator faces is having to navigate through a system that fundamentally
793920	800480	misunderstands our goals and motivations. By and large, society is run by the creatively bankrupt,
800480	805920	for the simple reason that society is run by adults. Ever since the 20th century,
805920	811840	psychologists have attempted to empirically define and measure creativity. Across repeated
811840	816160	studies spanning decades, researchers found that unlike nearly every other skill,
816720	822160	creativity tends to decrease as we get older. When it comes to creative reasoning,
822160	826240	specifically divergent thinking, no one is better than children.
827360	832960	In 1968, George Land and Beth Jarman were commissioned by NASA to devise a creativity
832960	839760	test for the agency's engineers and scientists. After applying their test to nearly 300,000 adults,
839760	846080	they found that only 2% scored at what they defined as a genius level. Just out of curiosity,
846080	851440	the researchers ran the same test on a group of a thousand preschoolers. Out of this average
851440	857440	sample of children aged no higher than 5 years old, the amount who achieved a genius score was
857440	864880	98%. Somewhere along the way to adulthood, we appear to unlearn the skill of creative thinking.
865440	871040	Of course, there are some intuitive factors for why this happens. Children lack the knowledge or
871040	876240	life experience to make informed decisions, so they have to rely more on their imaginations to
876240	881600	make sense of the world. As we get older, we become capable of more logical reasoning,
881600	887360	and creativity becomes less important in our day-to-day lives. Adults are also far more
887360	892800	cognizant of social perception. This newfound concern over how we appear to others contributes
892800	899680	to possibly the biggest obstacle to creativity, fear. Specifically, the fear of failure. When we
899680	904000	enter adulthood, there's an expectation that we should be at least competent at what we do.
904640	910560	It's often shameful to show a lack of aptitude in any given skill. Failure causes us to get
910560	915840	ridiculed by our peers and punished by our employers. Many adults have been conditioned
915840	920880	into the mindset that failure is not an option, to such an extent that they try to eliminate the
920880	925920	risk of failure in even the most minor circumstances. Children, on the other hand, are not
925920	932000	encumbered by such strict pressure to perform. They are mostly free to try and fail as much as they
932000	938560	please. Creativity cannot prosper in a culture of fear and anxiety. To truly reach our creative
938560	945120	potential, we can't allow failure to paralyze our willingness to explore new ideas. After all, the
945120	951120	fastest way to improve at anything is to learn from our mistakes. Speaking of learning, one major
951120	956160	factor which has exacerbated the decline in creative thinking has to do with the one place
956160	969600	where children are required to spend most of their time. Failing. Homework. Much, much more homework.
970480	976240	It's no secret that public education doesn't exactly have the best track record as of late.
976240	981840	As schools have grown increasingly obsessive over standardized testing, they have become notorious
981840	987920	for stifling creativity. The structure of the modern education system overwhelmingly forces
987920	993920	students to think inside the box. School very rapidly teaches kids that their imaginations are
994000	1000000	irrelevant. Getting good grades almost entirely depends on your ability to robotically memorize
1000000	1006400	arbitrary facts and figures. It's no wonder why so many young creative minds feel so antagonized by
1006400	1011760	modern education. As a student, you're given an ultimatum to either abandon your instinctive
1011760	1017920	curiosity or get punished for failing to conform to the system. In home movies, Brendan is a
1017920	1023760	character who embodies this struggle. He is very clearly a bright and motivated kid, but he finds
1023760	1029840	himself totally disconnected from conventional education. In a broader sense, this disconnect
1029840	1035680	reflects the underlying conceit of the entire show. Home movies is not just a show about how
1035680	1042080	kids thrive with creativity, but also how adults struggle without it. The structure of the series
1042080	1047680	fundamentally divides its characters into two distinct groups. While the kids often soak up
1047680	1053200	the spotlight, it's the adults who provide the show's most nuanced commentary. Pretty much every
1053200	1059120	major adult character in the series suffers from a significant flaw. The tedium of adult life has
1059120	1064400	left them uninspired and unfulfilled. You get the impression that each of them has a substantial
1064400	1070080	void in their lives which they're all trying to fill. This motif is punctuated by overtones of
1070080	1075680	divorce and loneliness which linger throughout the entire series. Home movies exposes a great
1075680	1081760	irony in the adult world's perceived superiority over children. Episodes typically feature both
1081760	1086000	children and adults dealing with a similar problem and displaying similar levels of
1086000	1091520	powerlessness to solve them. The series questions the prevailing belief that our logical adult
1091520	1096960	thinking is inherently beneficial. While concrete reasoning allows us to make good decisions,
1096960	1102560	it can simultaneously inhibit us from exploring better ones. Abundance and knowledge can make us
1102560	1107920	more informed, but it can also make us more cynical, stubborn, and prejudicial. Home movies
1107920	1113040	tends to portray its adult characters as being rigidly said in their own ways. They often have
1113040	1118080	a hard time expressing their honest thoughts and opinions to others, choosing instead to remain
1118080	1123680	burdened by their own discontent. By contrast, the children of the show rarely display any of
1123680	1129040	these characteristics. Creative thinking allows them to be far more earnest, cooperative, and
1129040	1135200	flexible. As adults, we're used to interacting with children in a condescending way, a relationship
1135280	1140800	that doesn't have to be so one-sided. The most harmonious moments within the series happen when
1140800	1146400	both the kids and adults engage with each other as equals. It turns out that despite everything
1146400	1151920	we know, we can still learn a thing or two from children. Don't get into show business, Josie.
1151920	1156240	Don't spend your life being dragged down by projects that you'd lose interest in and have
1156240	1166880	to sneak away from. Where's my childhood gone, Josie? These days, creativity remains an elusive
1166880	1172720	skill in the adult world. The way our society works, most creative people won't end up being
1172720	1179840	successful. But in a strange twist of fate, the most successful people are creative. In the 1950s,
1179840	1185440	psychologist E.P. Torrance developed one of the first comprehensive tests of creative thinking.
1185440	1190400	Over the following decades, researchers began to realize that the Torrance test was a stronger
1190400	1196240	predictor of lifetime achievement than any other known method. Longitudinal research suggests that
1196240	1202480	it is creativity, not IQ nor academic grades, which correlates the strongest with individual
1202480	1211120	success. In 2010, IBM surveyed over 1,500 CEOs from around the world and found that 60% cited
1211120	1216480	creativity as their single most important leadership quality. Great scientific minds
1216480	1221840	like Isaac Asimov and Albert Einstein have both expressed that creativity is vital in even the
1221840	1228080	most logical fields. Those who master the creative process can go as far as their imagination takes
1228080	1233840	them. For something so influential, it's a shame that so few of us actually retain it as we grow
1233840	1238960	up. Research has shown that even children are becoming less creative compared to previous
1238960	1244800	generations. In life, we take a lot of things for granted and fail to appreciate their greatness
1244800	1254240	until long after they're gone. On April 4, 2004, home movies went out on the air for the final time.
1254880	1260720	The series made it to 52 episodes, surviving 10 times longer than its initial ill-fated run.
1261280	1265680	It exceeded pretty much every expectation that its creators could have envisioned.
1265680	1272080	But sadly, all good shows must eventually come to an end. Home movies chose to finish its run
1272080	1277280	in the only way it could. A big part of the freedom we get from creative projects is the
1277280	1283120	power to walk away. At the end of home movies, Brendan and his friends lose their passion for
1283120	1289200	making movies. As is the fate with almost all kids, they had grown past their creative endeavors.
1289920	1294160	When it was all said and done, they realized that the movies were no longer needed.
1294160	1299600	They had served their purpose. For the first time in the series, Brendan is ready to step out from
1299600	1307680	behind the camera and into reality. Home movies was a show that was remarkably ahead of its time.
1307680	1312640	Just one year after the series ended, we were all introduced to a little-known website called
1312640	1318640	YouTube, a place where anyone can become world famous from making home movies. Thanks to the
1318640	1323840	internet, it's never been a better time to be creative. And while many of us may have unlearned
1323840	1330400	how to think creatively, none of us ever truly forget it. If you want to reclaim your imagination,
1330400	1336320	a good place to start is learning from the case of Gerald Bostic, who, like the kids in home movies,
1336320	1342080	doesn't actually exist. They were all created by adults who remembered how to think like an
1342080	1348160	eight-year-old. As the great painter Pablo Picasso once said, all children are artists.
1348160	1351120	The problem is how to remain an artist once we grow up.
1354800	1375920	Welcome, Rusty. I've been expecting you. Come, have a seat.
1377120	1379920	Oh God, what are we selling this time?
1380480	1384720	What if I told you that nearly everyone you know is a slave to the system?
1385360	1389680	Have you ever looked at the world around you and had the strange feeling that something is not
1389680	1396560	quite right? You feel it when you go to work, when you go to church, when you pay your taxes.
1397680	1403040	Are you suggesting that we're all imprisoned in some kind of simulated reality?
1403040	1408480	No, we are definitely in the real world. The problem is that the real world sucks,
1408480	1413680	and spineless bureaucrats make us do a bunch of annoying pointless crap like paying taxes.
1414320	1418880	You see it when you look out your window, when you turn on your television.
1418880	1424400	This society is simply unfair to people like us. So what are we supposed to do about it?
1424400	1428240	I cannot give you a harmonious solution to all of the world's problems.
1428800	1431760	What I can offer you is a way out.
1431760	1437280	I am speaking, of course, about the Raytrix.
1438800	1440160	The Raytrix?
1440160	1443520	Rusty, have you ever heard of the term sigma male?
1444240	1445680	I'm not sure I have.
1446240	1451280	Most unfortunate souls are born into this world to be nothing more than sheeple.
1451280	1456800	Fools who will gladly pay outrageous prices for premium wireless earbuds without even a
1456800	1462720	second thought. It is the wool that has been pulled over your ears to deafen you from the truth.
1463440	1466960	However, the sigmas of the world reject this premise.
1466960	1471680	They recognize that there is an alternative to other premium audio brands that starts
1471680	1472960	at just half the price.
1473520	1474480	No way.
1474480	1475360	You can't mean-
1475360	1481760	That is correct. I'm referring to Raycon earbuds, your key to unlocking the Raytrix.
1481760	1487120	With this state-of-the-art technology, you can tune out the stupidity of the world around you,
1487120	1489280	anywhere, at any time.
1489280	1494480	Let the sheeple graze on the lies of the system which imprisons them, while you bask in the
1494480	1499760	amazing audio quality of the Raytrix, free from the shackles of our noisy society.
1500800	1504080	Rusty, I've always suspected that you are a true sigma.
1505120	1506880	Now is the time to prove it.
1507600	1510400	Of course, no one can be told what the Raytrix is.
1510960	1512560	You have to hear it for yourself.
1513520	1515120	This is your last chance.
1515840	1518000	After this, there is no turning back.
1518880	1524400	You take the blue pill, the story ends, you wake up in your bed, and go back to paying
1524400	1527120	whatever other premium audio brands want to charge you.
1528000	1533760	You take the red pill, you stay in Wonderland, and I show you how far downward the spiral goes.
1540400	1548080	What if I told you that you can purchase your own
1548080	1554720	pair of Raycon Everyday Earbuds by visiting buyraycon.com or by visiting the link in the

1596880	1606080	And that makes him a lot smarter than you.
1606080	1607440	That's what I keep telling them.
1607440	1611120	Home Movies premieres in two weeks on UPS.
