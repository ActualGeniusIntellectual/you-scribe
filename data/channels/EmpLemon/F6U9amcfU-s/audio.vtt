00:05.520 --> 00:10.560
Hello, Your Honor. As you can see, I've decided to make a video essay in place of a written essay.

00:11.120 --> 00:16.480
Generally speaking, kids are dumb. They tend to not know anything about anything,

00:16.480 --> 00:21.760
and very few of them have any skills that can be considered even somewhat valuable to society.

00:22.320 --> 00:27.520
Being an adult is better in just about every conceivable way. But despite our overwhelming

00:27.520 --> 00:35.520
advantages, there's one aspect where kids have us absolutely beat. In 1972, British progressive

00:35.520 --> 00:41.520
rock band Jethro Tull released their fifth studio album, Thick as a Brick, an epic tale told through

00:41.520 --> 00:47.520
the ambitious format of one continuous piece of music. Front man Ian Anderson credited the

00:47.520 --> 00:52.720
fantastical lyrics of the composition to an eight-year-old boy named Gerald Bostic.

00:52.720 --> 00:57.520
The album was so imaginative it made sense to many that it could only have come from the wild

00:57.520 --> 01:05.520
mind of a child. When it comes to creativity, kids are king. And 20 years ago, one show helped many

01:05.520 --> 01:18.160
of us channel our inner eight-year-old. 1999 was a landmark time for American animation. The year

01:18.160 --> 01:23.600
introduced us to some of the most influential cartoons of the 21st century, but lost among

01:23.600 --> 01:29.600
the titans of its era was a series that received far less fanfare. Home Movies was a largely

01:29.600 --> 01:36.320
forgotten show that debuted on a largely forgotten network. UPN was Viacom's awkward attempt to

01:36.320 --> 01:42.400
establish a new broadcast network on American television. Across its 11 years of operation,

01:42.400 --> 01:48.080
it struggled to even make a dent on mainstream culture. If you were watching American television

01:48.080 --> 01:56.480
in the 90s, you probably weren't watching UPN. In 1999, the six major networks broadcast 164

01:56.480 --> 02:03.600
unique shows on the air. Arranged by viewership, UPN aired 22 of the 25 least watched shows of the

02:03.600 --> 02:10.240
year. And second from the very bottom of the list was the subject of today's video. Home Movies

02:10.240 --> 02:16.800
premiered on April 26, 1999 to historically low ratings, the worst the network had ever seen in

02:16.800 --> 02:23.760
its time slot. Just 30 days later, UPN pulled the plug and canceled the show after only five

02:23.760 --> 02:29.280
episodes. During its brief stint, the series received generally unfavorable reviews from

02:29.280 --> 02:34.880
critics. The launch was one of the most disastrous in the history of television, and it's not hard to

02:34.880 --> 02:40.240
see why the 90s audience weren't exactly crazy about the new cartoon. Pretty much everything

02:40.240 --> 02:46.400
about the show was unorthodox. The art style was crude and childlike. The series was animated using

02:46.400 --> 02:51.200
the incredibly niche technique of squiggle vision, which some viewers found hard to watch.

02:51.760 --> 02:56.160
The show's dialogue was almost completely improvised, which was practically unheard

02:56.160 --> 03:01.760
of for any other animated program at the time. The comedy was subtle and understated in an era

03:01.760 --> 03:07.040
of bombastic in-your-face humor. It was a show that looked like a Newgrounds animation and

03:07.040 --> 03:12.960
sounded like a podcast. Needless to say, Home Movies was unlike anything else in its era,

03:12.960 --> 03:18.640
and hardly anyone was willing to watch something so different. However, not every series needs to

03:18.640 --> 03:23.840
be loved by millions of people. Sometimes all a show has to do is impress just one.

03:24.640 --> 03:29.760
During its short run, Home Movies managed to pick up one important fan in Khaki Jones,

03:29.760 --> 03:34.960
an executive at Cartoon Network. She loved the show so much that she convinced the network to

03:34.960 --> 03:41.280
renew Home Movies for three more seasons. On September 2, 2001, Home Movies would

03:41.280 --> 03:46.960
re-debut as the very first program on Cartoon Network's brand new animation block Adult Swim.

03:46.960 --> 03:51.440
Now loosely scripted and flash animated, the show had turned over a new leaf.

03:52.000 --> 03:57.120
And gradually, over several years, audiences finally began to warm up to it.

03:57.120 --> 04:02.160
The series has since developed a cult following and has been critically reassessed as one of the

04:02.160 --> 04:08.640
best cartoons of its era. So how exactly did Home Movies age so well? On its surface, it's a

04:08.640 --> 04:14.160
relatively simple show about the trivialities of childhood. But where the series truly shines is

04:14.160 --> 04:19.600
through its meta-contextual significance. Home Movies has possibly the most to say of any show

04:19.600 --> 04:24.880
about the nature of the creative process. This is crazy, but maybe you might be working a little

04:24.880 --> 04:33.040
too much on your films. That's what people say, but... Creativity is a concept that has always

04:33.040 --> 04:38.240
been somewhat enigmatic to us. The ancient Greeks did not have any words in their language

04:38.240 --> 04:44.320
corresponding to the idea of people as creators. For centuries, philosophers did not consider art

04:44.320 --> 04:49.200
to be creative, positing that the role of an artist was to simply interpret what was already

04:49.200 --> 04:56.000
provided by nature. In the Middle Ages, creativity was heavily intertwined with religion, and artistic

04:56.000 --> 05:01.840
spontaneity was attributed to flashes of divine inspiration. It was only during the Renaissance

05:01.840 --> 05:06.880
when philosophers began to consider that human beings were capable of producing creative works

05:06.880 --> 05:12.320
on their own volition. Soon enough, creative work had become a legitimate profession.

05:12.320 --> 05:17.840
Artists achieved worldwide fame for their unmatched ability to bring their imagination to life.

05:17.840 --> 05:23.120
By the 20th century, creative works laid the foundation for billion-dollar industries.

05:23.120 --> 05:27.680
Entertainment media eventually became so inescapable that the tools of the trade became

05:27.680 --> 05:33.600
accessible to just about anybody, setting up the premise of Home Movies. The story of a boy and his

05:33.600 --> 05:39.520
camera. Throughout the show, we get to experience the adventures and misadventures of Brendan Small,

05:39.520 --> 05:45.520
who makes movies with his friends Jason and Melissa. Brendan's parents have recently divorced,

05:45.520 --> 05:50.240
and filmmaking provides him with a much needed escape from a turbulent period in his life.

05:50.880 --> 05:56.160
Although his movies are far from the best, he's not afraid to keep trying. The character of

05:56.160 --> 06:02.320
Brendan Small is a not-so-subtle nod to series co-creator Brendan Small. Home Movies presents

06:02.320 --> 06:07.840
a rather unique symmetry between its creators and characters. The essential conflict portrayed

06:07.840 --> 06:14.000
within the show parallels the external conflict experienced by the show. Home Movies was not a

06:14.000 --> 06:19.600
show for everyone, as evidenced by how few people actually watched it while it was on the air.

06:19.600 --> 06:23.920
Those who enjoyed it likely related to the characters based on their own creative and

06:23.920 --> 06:30.320
personal struggles. Brendan is a 21st century Charlie Brown. He's a natural underdog, grappling

06:30.320 --> 06:36.240
with the unfairness of a world beyond his control. Within the show, Brendan's movies are not exactly

06:36.240 --> 06:41.520
the pinnacle of filmmaking. They are often riddled with technical errors and general sloppiness

06:41.520 --> 06:46.480
befitting of a novice who's figuring things out as they go along. But even though his movies may

06:46.480 --> 06:52.800
appear crude, they are far from aimless. Brendan takes his filmmaking very seriously, more so than

06:52.800 --> 06:59.360
pretty much anything else in his life. He sees his ability to make movies as his defining attribute.

06:59.360 --> 07:04.160
It's easy for us to dismiss children's activities as inherently goofy and frivolous,

07:04.160 --> 07:10.000
but Brendan's artistic endeavors are far more meaningful. Nothing he creates is arbitrary. Each

07:10.000 --> 07:16.560
one of his movies has a clear vision, even if his ability to execute may be lacking. Brendan's plight

07:16.560 --> 07:21.840
is something experienced by all creative people at one point or another. No matter how brilliant

07:21.840 --> 07:27.040
our vision may be, we're always caught in a tug of war between imagination and feasibility.

07:27.760 --> 07:32.160
Home Movies offers a powerful commentary on the barriers to creative fulfillment.

07:38.240 --> 07:43.120
Our society has a somewhat paradoxical relationship with creative works.

07:43.120 --> 07:48.320
The most illustrious artists, musicians, and movie stars are often among the most revered people in

07:48.320 --> 07:54.480
the world. We each dedicate a significant amount of our free time engaging with creatively motivated

07:54.480 --> 07:59.760
products like film, music, and video games. Nearly all of us would agree that these things

07:59.760 --> 08:05.120
vastly improve our quality of life. However, despite how much we enjoy the fruits of our

08:05.120 --> 08:10.640
most successful creators, modern society is generally unforgiving to the process it takes

08:10.640 --> 08:16.480
to get there. For as much as powerful institutions like Dispout platitudes about the importance of

08:16.480 --> 08:22.000
creativity, the fact of the matter is that our society is not very welcoming to creative people.

08:22.800 --> 08:28.400
Creative ideas are inherently risky. Each innovative new solution is usually preceded by

08:28.400 --> 08:34.160
a dozen failures. It's for this reason why the vast majority of jobs in the economy don't value

08:34.160 --> 08:40.400
creativity as a skill. There's no need to reinvent the wheel if the wheel itself is good enough.

08:40.400 --> 08:45.520
When most jobs can be accomplished by mindlessly rehearsing an already proven formula,

08:45.520 --> 08:51.360
the ability to think creatively is worthless. This is why artists who haven't hauled in gazillions in

08:51.360 --> 08:57.120
revenue don't tend to receive much prestige. Without impressive dollar amounts to show for it,

08:57.120 --> 09:02.400
the value of creativity is intangible, which for the average person might as well be nothing.

09:03.120 --> 09:08.400
Because of their perceived lack of value, creative people often find themselves being overlooked,

09:08.400 --> 09:13.840
invalidated, or even stigmatized for their ambitions. It's an attitude all too familiar

09:13.840 --> 09:20.000
to the creators of home movies. Back in 1999, Brendan Small and Lorne Bouchard were too young

09:20.000 --> 09:25.360
and unproven minds looking to make something truly distinct and avant-garde. The resulting

09:25.360 --> 09:30.080
project nearly ended up costing them a rare opportunity as success in the entertainment

09:30.080 --> 09:35.440
industry. Both creators would eventually go on to have long and successful careers,

09:35.440 --> 09:40.960
but if it weren't for a chance rescue from a lone network executive, their creative contributions

09:40.960 --> 09:46.240
may have never had a chance to flourish. It's easy to recognize their skill in hindsight,

09:46.240 --> 09:50.880
but were they really any less talented 22 years ago when their grand artistic vision

09:50.880 --> 10:07.520
was canceled after just five episodes? It's often difficult for us to evaluate whether any given

10:07.520 --> 10:12.800
creative project will be successful. Bigwig Entertainment executives have the resources

10:12.800 --> 10:18.000
to create anything they want, and most of it usually ends up sucking. Of course,

10:18.000 --> 10:23.120
these people aren't fools. Somewhere along the way, the entertainment industry figured out that

10:23.120 --> 10:28.880
movies and TV shows don't have to be good to make a boatload of cash. It's completely logical for

10:28.880 --> 10:34.240
media moguls to invest their money in the 10,000 superhero reboot versus an unproven original

10:34.240 --> 10:39.840
concept. The problem is that once all the money is made and enough time has passed, the product

10:39.840 --> 10:46.480
that remains is not very inspiring. Logic is often antithetical to creativity, and creativity

10:46.480 --> 10:58.000
is often antithetical to profitability. There's a reason why the most critically acclaimed art

10:58.000 --> 11:03.600
tends to be the most niche. Truly great works are never meant to please everyone. The strength of

11:03.600 --> 11:08.960
art lies in its power to alienate. If you want to see something new and innovative, it's going to

11:08.960 --> 11:14.480
have to be a little alien. Prioritizing mass appeal and financial gain misses the point of

11:14.480 --> 11:20.000
creation entirely. Historically, the greatest art has almost always come from people who have had

11:20.000 --> 11:26.000
nothing to lose and no one to impress. By removing ourselves from the expectations and limitations

11:26.000 --> 11:32.400
of others, we become truly free to pursue our vision. Creativity may be the ultimate exercise

11:32.400 --> 11:37.600
in autonomy. It's an activity through which we have complete control over our domain.

11:38.240 --> 11:43.760
Mastering the creative process requires overcoming one's limitations while retaining as much autonomy

11:43.760 --> 11:49.600
as possible. Home Movies is a passion project, let's say, in that we fight for the things that

11:49.600 --> 11:55.520
we think the show should be always. Both Brendan's movies and the show that encompasses them were

11:55.520 --> 12:01.360
heavily limited in budget and manpower, but found a way to make the most of what they had. We can

12:01.360 --> 12:06.640
still find them endearing because there's never any question of who's in creative control. Home

12:06.640 --> 12:12.000
Movies may not be the most polished product, but it's charming in the way it allows the personality

12:12.000 --> 12:17.920
of its creators to shine through. Art is ultimately a metaphysical extension of the self,

12:17.920 --> 12:24.000
meaning that just like us, it's dynamic. In a long-term creative project like a TV show,

12:24.000 --> 12:29.920
it's intriguing to watch it evolve along with its creators. In Home Movies, there's a tangible sense

12:29.920 --> 12:35.040
of progression through the seasons. The creators get more confident in their storytelling, the

12:35.040 --> 12:40.400
writing becomes more sophisticated, the actors really start to settle into their characters,

12:40.400 --> 12:45.600
even the animation noticeably improves as the show's animators develop their techniques.

12:45.600 --> 12:52.560
When given the space to do so, art can come alive. Home Movies was fortunate to wind up on what was

12:52.560 --> 12:58.000
the perfect destination for creative liberty. Adult Swim was the first television studio to

12:58.000 --> 13:04.080
truly embrace experimental creator-driven content. Tragically, the vast majority of commercial

13:04.080 --> 13:09.120
artists are given nowhere near as much freedom over their creative destiny. Perhaps the most

13:09.120 --> 13:13.920
difficult constraint any creator faces is having to navigate through a system that fundamentally

13:13.920 --> 13:20.480
misunderstands our goals and motivations. By and large, society is run by the creatively bankrupt,

13:20.480 --> 13:25.920
for the simple reason that society is run by adults. Ever since the 20th century,

13:25.920 --> 13:31.840
psychologists have attempted to empirically define and measure creativity. Across repeated

13:31.840 --> 13:36.160
studies spanning decades, researchers found that unlike nearly every other skill,

13:36.720 --> 13:42.160
creativity tends to decrease as we get older. When it comes to creative reasoning,

13:42.160 --> 13:46.240
specifically divergent thinking, no one is better than children.

13:47.360 --> 13:52.960
In 1968, George Land and Beth Jarman were commissioned by NASA to devise a creativity

13:52.960 --> 13:59.760
test for the agency's engineers and scientists. After applying their test to nearly 300,000 adults,

13:59.760 --> 14:06.080
they found that only 2% scored at what they defined as a genius level. Just out of curiosity,

14:06.080 --> 14:11.440
the researchers ran the same test on a group of a thousand preschoolers. Out of this average

14:11.440 --> 14:17.440
sample of children aged no higher than 5 years old, the amount who achieved a genius score was

14:17.440 --> 14:24.880
98%. Somewhere along the way to adulthood, we appear to unlearn the skill of creative thinking.

14:25.440 --> 14:31.040
Of course, there are some intuitive factors for why this happens. Children lack the knowledge or

14:31.040 --> 14:36.240
life experience to make informed decisions, so they have to rely more on their imaginations to

14:36.240 --> 14:41.600
make sense of the world. As we get older, we become capable of more logical reasoning,

14:41.600 --> 14:47.360
and creativity becomes less important in our day-to-day lives. Adults are also far more

14:47.360 --> 14:52.800
cognizant of social perception. This newfound concern over how we appear to others contributes

14:52.800 --> 14:59.680
to possibly the biggest obstacle to creativity, fear. Specifically, the fear of failure. When we

14:59.680 --> 15:04.000
enter adulthood, there's an expectation that we should be at least competent at what we do.

15:04.640 --> 15:10.560
It's often shameful to show a lack of aptitude in any given skill. Failure causes us to get

15:10.560 --> 15:15.840
ridiculed by our peers and punished by our employers. Many adults have been conditioned

15:15.840 --> 15:20.880
into the mindset that failure is not an option, to such an extent that they try to eliminate the

15:20.880 --> 15:25.920
risk of failure in even the most minor circumstances. Children, on the other hand, are not

15:25.920 --> 15:32.000
encumbered by such strict pressure to perform. They are mostly free to try and fail as much as they

15:32.000 --> 15:38.560
please. Creativity cannot prosper in a culture of fear and anxiety. To truly reach our creative

15:38.560 --> 15:45.120
potential, we can't allow failure to paralyze our willingness to explore new ideas. After all, the

15:45.120 --> 15:51.120
fastest way to improve at anything is to learn from our mistakes. Speaking of learning, one major

15:51.120 --> 15:56.160
factor which has exacerbated the decline in creative thinking has to do with the one place

15:56.160 --> 16:09.600
where children are required to spend most of their time. Failing. Homework. Much, much more homework.

16:10.480 --> 16:16.240
It's no secret that public education doesn't exactly have the best track record as of late.

16:16.240 --> 16:21.840
As schools have grown increasingly obsessive over standardized testing, they have become notorious

16:21.840 --> 16:27.920
for stifling creativity. The structure of the modern education system overwhelmingly forces

16:27.920 --> 16:33.920
students to think inside the box. School very rapidly teaches kids that their imaginations are

16:34.000 --> 16:40.000
irrelevant. Getting good grades almost entirely depends on your ability to robotically memorize

16:40.000 --> 16:46.400
arbitrary facts and figures. It's no wonder why so many young creative minds feel so antagonized by

16:46.400 --> 16:51.760
modern education. As a student, you're given an ultimatum to either abandon your instinctive

16:51.760 --> 16:57.920
curiosity or get punished for failing to conform to the system. In home movies, Brendan is a

16:57.920 --> 17:03.760
character who embodies this struggle. He is very clearly a bright and motivated kid, but he finds

17:03.760 --> 17:09.840
himself totally disconnected from conventional education. In a broader sense, this disconnect

17:09.840 --> 17:15.680
reflects the underlying conceit of the entire show. Home movies is not just a show about how

17:15.680 --> 17:22.080
kids thrive with creativity, but also how adults struggle without it. The structure of the series

17:22.080 --> 17:27.680
fundamentally divides its characters into two distinct groups. While the kids often soak up

17:27.680 --> 17:33.200
the spotlight, it's the adults who provide the show's most nuanced commentary. Pretty much every

17:33.200 --> 17:39.120
major adult character in the series suffers from a significant flaw. The tedium of adult life has

17:39.120 --> 17:44.400
left them uninspired and unfulfilled. You get the impression that each of them has a substantial

17:44.400 --> 17:50.080
void in their lives which they're all trying to fill. This motif is punctuated by overtones of

17:50.080 --> 17:55.680
divorce and loneliness which linger throughout the entire series. Home movies exposes a great

17:55.680 --> 18:01.760
irony in the adult world's perceived superiority over children. Episodes typically feature both

18:01.760 --> 18:06.000
children and adults dealing with a similar problem and displaying similar levels of

18:06.000 --> 18:11.520
powerlessness to solve them. The series questions the prevailing belief that our logical adult

18:11.520 --> 18:16.960
thinking is inherently beneficial. While concrete reasoning allows us to make good decisions,

18:16.960 --> 18:22.560
it can simultaneously inhibit us from exploring better ones. Abundance and knowledge can make us

18:22.560 --> 18:27.920
more informed, but it can also make us more cynical, stubborn, and prejudicial. Home movies

18:27.920 --> 18:33.040
tends to portray its adult characters as being rigidly said in their own ways. They often have

18:33.040 --> 18:38.080
a hard time expressing their honest thoughts and opinions to others, choosing instead to remain

18:38.080 --> 18:43.680
burdened by their own discontent. By contrast, the children of the show rarely display any of

18:43.680 --> 18:49.040
these characteristics. Creative thinking allows them to be far more earnest, cooperative, and

18:49.040 --> 18:55.200
flexible. As adults, we're used to interacting with children in a condescending way, a relationship

18:55.280 --> 19:00.800
that doesn't have to be so one-sided. The most harmonious moments within the series happen when

19:00.800 --> 19:06.400
both the kids and adults engage with each other as equals. It turns out that despite everything

19:06.400 --> 19:11.920
we know, we can still learn a thing or two from children. Don't get into show business, Josie.

19:11.920 --> 19:16.240
Don't spend your life being dragged down by projects that you'd lose interest in and have

19:16.240 --> 19:26.880
to sneak away from. Where's my childhood gone, Josie? These days, creativity remains an elusive

19:26.880 --> 19:32.720
skill in the adult world. The way our society works, most creative people won't end up being

19:32.720 --> 19:39.840
successful. But in a strange twist of fate, the most successful people are creative. In the 1950s,

19:39.840 --> 19:45.440
psychologist E.P. Torrance developed one of the first comprehensive tests of creative thinking.

19:45.440 --> 19:50.400
Over the following decades, researchers began to realize that the Torrance test was a stronger

19:50.400 --> 19:56.240
predictor of lifetime achievement than any other known method. Longitudinal research suggests that

19:56.240 --> 20:02.480
it is creativity, not IQ nor academic grades, which correlates the strongest with individual

20:02.480 --> 20:11.120
success. In 2010, IBM surveyed over 1,500 CEOs from around the world and found that 60% cited

20:11.120 --> 20:16.480
creativity as their single most important leadership quality. Great scientific minds

20:16.480 --> 20:21.840
like Isaac Asimov and Albert Einstein have both expressed that creativity is vital in even the

20:21.840 --> 20:28.080
most logical fields. Those who master the creative process can go as far as their imagination takes

20:28.080 --> 20:33.840
them. For something so influential, it's a shame that so few of us actually retain it as we grow

20:33.840 --> 20:38.960
up. Research has shown that even children are becoming less creative compared to previous

20:38.960 --> 20:44.800
generations. In life, we take a lot of things for granted and fail to appreciate their greatness

20:44.800 --> 20:54.240
until long after they're gone. On April 4, 2004, home movies went out on the air for the final time.

20:54.880 --> 21:00.720
The series made it to 52 episodes, surviving 10 times longer than its initial ill-fated run.

21:01.280 --> 21:05.680
It exceeded pretty much every expectation that its creators could have envisioned.

21:05.680 --> 21:12.080
But sadly, all good shows must eventually come to an end. Home movies chose to finish its run

21:12.080 --> 21:17.280
in the only way it could. A big part of the freedom we get from creative projects is the

21:17.280 --> 21:23.120
power to walk away. At the end of home movies, Brendan and his friends lose their passion for

21:23.120 --> 21:29.200
making movies. As is the fate with almost all kids, they had grown past their creative endeavors.

21:29.920 --> 21:34.160
When it was all said and done, they realized that the movies were no longer needed.

21:34.160 --> 21:39.600
They had served their purpose. For the first time in the series, Brendan is ready to step out from

21:39.600 --> 21:47.680
behind the camera and into reality. Home movies was a show that was remarkably ahead of its time.

21:47.680 --> 21:52.640
Just one year after the series ended, we were all introduced to a little-known website called

21:52.640 --> 21:58.640
YouTube, a place where anyone can become world famous from making home movies. Thanks to the

21:58.640 --> 22:03.840
internet, it's never been a better time to be creative. And while many of us may have unlearned

22:03.840 --> 22:10.400
how to think creatively, none of us ever truly forget it. If you want to reclaim your imagination,

22:10.400 --> 22:16.320
a good place to start is learning from the case of Gerald Bostic, who, like the kids in home movies,

22:16.320 --> 22:22.080
doesn't actually exist. They were all created by adults who remembered how to think like an

22:22.080 --> 22:28.160
eight-year-old. As the great painter Pablo Picasso once said, all children are artists.

22:28.160 --> 22:31.120
The problem is how to remain an artist once we grow up.

22:34.800 --> 22:55.920
Welcome, Rusty. I've been expecting you. Come, have a seat.

22:57.120 --> 22:59.920
Oh God, what are we selling this time?

23:00.480 --> 23:04.720
What if I told you that nearly everyone you know is a slave to the system?

23:05.360 --> 23:09.680
Have you ever looked at the world around you and had the strange feeling that something is not

23:09.680 --> 23:16.560
quite right? You feel it when you go to work, when you go to church, when you pay your taxes.

23:17.680 --> 23:23.040
Are you suggesting that we're all imprisoned in some kind of simulated reality?

23:23.040 --> 23:28.480
No, we are definitely in the real world. The problem is that the real world sucks,

23:28.480 --> 23:33.680
and spineless bureaucrats make us do a bunch of annoying pointless crap like paying taxes.

23:34.320 --> 23:38.880
You see it when you look out your window, when you turn on your television.

23:38.880 --> 23:44.400
This society is simply unfair to people like us. So what are we supposed to do about it?

23:44.400 --> 23:48.240
I cannot give you a harmonious solution to all of the world's problems.

23:48.800 --> 23:51.760
What I can offer you is a way out.

23:51.760 --> 23:57.280
I am speaking, of course, about the Raytrix.

23:58.800 --> 24:00.160
The Raytrix?

24:00.160 --> 24:03.520
Rusty, have you ever heard of the term sigma male?

24:04.240 --> 24:05.680
I'm not sure I have.

24:06.240 --> 24:11.280
Most unfortunate souls are born into this world to be nothing more than sheeple.

24:11.280 --> 24:16.800
Fools who will gladly pay outrageous prices for premium wireless earbuds without even a

24:16.800 --> 24:22.720
second thought. It is the wool that has been pulled over your ears to deafen you from the truth.

24:23.440 --> 24:26.960
However, the sigmas of the world reject this premise.

24:26.960 --> 24:31.680
They recognize that there is an alternative to other premium audio brands that starts

24:31.680 --> 24:32.960
at just half the price.

24:33.520 --> 24:34.480
No way.

24:34.480 --> 24:35.360
You can't mean-

24:35.360 --> 24:41.760
That is correct. I'm referring to Raycon earbuds, your key to unlocking the Raytrix.

24:41.760 --> 24:47.120
With this state-of-the-art technology, you can tune out the stupidity of the world around you,

24:47.120 --> 24:49.280
anywhere, at any time.

24:49.280 --> 24:54.480
Let the sheeple graze on the lies of the system which imprisons them, while you bask in the

24:54.480 --> 24:59.760
amazing audio quality of the Raytrix, free from the shackles of our noisy society.

25:00.800 --> 25:04.080
Rusty, I've always suspected that you are a true sigma.

25:05.120 --> 25:06.880
Now is the time to prove it.

25:07.600 --> 25:10.400
Of course, no one can be told what the Raytrix is.

25:10.960 --> 25:12.560
You have to hear it for yourself.

25:13.520 --> 25:15.120
This is your last chance.

25:15.840 --> 25:18.000
After this, there is no turning back.

25:18.880 --> 25:24.400
You take the blue pill, the story ends, you wake up in your bed, and go back to paying

25:24.400 --> 25:27.120
whatever other premium audio brands want to charge you.

25:28.000 --> 25:33.760
You take the red pill, you stay in Wonderland, and I show you how far downward the spiral goes.

25:40.400 --> 25:48.080
What if I told you that you can purchase your own

25:48.080 --> 25:54.720
pair of Raycon Everyday Earbuds by visiting buyraycon.com or by visiting the link in the

25:54.720 --> 25:56.720

26:36.880 --> 26:46.080
And that makes him a lot smarter than you.

26:46.080 --> 26:47.440
That's what I keep telling them.

26:47.440 --> 26:51.120
Home Movies premieres in two weeks on UPS.
