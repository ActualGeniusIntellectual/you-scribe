00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,560
Hello, Your Honor. As you can see, I've decided to make a video essay in place of a written essay.

3
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:16,480
Generally speaking, kids are dumb. They tend to not know anything about anything,

4
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:21,760
and very few of them have any skills that can be considered even somewhat valuable to society.

5
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:27,520
Being an adult is better in just about every conceivable way. But despite our overwhelming

6
00:00:27,520 --> 00:00:35,520
advantages, there's one aspect where kids have us absolutely beat. In 1972, British progressive

7
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:41,520
rock band Jethro Tull released their fifth studio album, Thick as a Brick, an epic tale told through

8
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:47,520
the ambitious format of one continuous piece of music. Front man Ian Anderson credited the

9
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:52,720
fantastical lyrics of the composition to an eight-year-old boy named Gerald Bostic.

10
00:00:52,720 --> 00:00:57,520
The album was so imaginative it made sense to many that it could only have come from the wild

11
00:00:57,520 --> 00:01:05,520
mind of a child. When it comes to creativity, kids are king. And 20 years ago, one show helped many

12
00:01:05,520 --> 00:01:18,160
of us channel our inner eight-year-old. 1999 was a landmark time for American animation. The year

13
00:01:18,160 --> 00:01:23,600
introduced us to some of the most influential cartoons of the 21st century, but lost among

14
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:29,600
the titans of its era was a series that received far less fanfare. Home Movies was a largely

15
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:36,320
forgotten show that debuted on a largely forgotten network. UPN was Viacom's awkward attempt to

16
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:42,400
establish a new broadcast network on American television. Across its 11 years of operation,

17
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:48,080
it struggled to even make a dent on mainstream culture. If you were watching American television

18
00:01:48,080 --> 00:01:56,480
in the 90s, you probably weren't watching UPN. In 1999, the six major networks broadcast 164

19
00:01:56,480 --> 00:02:03,600
unique shows on the air. Arranged by viewership, UPN aired 22 of the 25 least watched shows of the

20
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:10,240
year. And second from the very bottom of the list was the subject of today's video. Home Movies

21
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:16,800
premiered on April 26, 1999 to historically low ratings, the worst the network had ever seen in

22
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:23,760
its time slot. Just 30 days later, UPN pulled the plug and canceled the show after only five

23
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:29,280
episodes. During its brief stint, the series received generally unfavorable reviews from

24
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:34,880
critics. The launch was one of the most disastrous in the history of television, and it's not hard to

25
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:40,240
see why the 90s audience weren't exactly crazy about the new cartoon. Pretty much everything

26
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:46,400
about the show was unorthodox. The art style was crude and childlike. The series was animated using

27
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:51,200
the incredibly niche technique of squiggle vision, which some viewers found hard to watch.

28
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:56,160
The show's dialogue was almost completely improvised, which was practically unheard

29
00:02:56,160 --> 00:03:01,760
of for any other animated program at the time. The comedy was subtle and understated in an era

30
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:07,040
of bombastic in-your-face humor. It was a show that looked like a Newgrounds animation and

31
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:12,960
sounded like a podcast. Needless to say, Home Movies was unlike anything else in its era,

32
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:18,640
and hardly anyone was willing to watch something so different. However, not every series needs to

33
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:23,840
be loved by millions of people. Sometimes all a show has to do is impress just one.

34
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:29,760
During its short run, Home Movies managed to pick up one important fan in Khaki Jones,

35
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:34,960
an executive at Cartoon Network. She loved the show so much that she convinced the network to

36
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:41,280
renew Home Movies for three more seasons. On September 2, 2001, Home Movies would

37
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:46,960
re-debut as the very first program on Cartoon Network's brand new animation block Adult Swim.

38
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:51,440
Now loosely scripted and flash animated, the show had turned over a new leaf.

39
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:57,120
And gradually, over several years, audiences finally began to warm up to it.

40
00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:02,160
The series has since developed a cult following and has been critically reassessed as one of the

41
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:08,640
best cartoons of its era. So how exactly did Home Movies age so well? On its surface, it's a

42
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:14,160
relatively simple show about the trivialities of childhood. But where the series truly shines is

43
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:19,600
through its meta-contextual significance. Home Movies has possibly the most to say of any show

44
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:24,880
about the nature of the creative process. This is crazy, but maybe you might be working a little

45
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:33,040
too much on your films. That's what people say, but... Creativity is a concept that has always

46
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:38,240
been somewhat enigmatic to us. The ancient Greeks did not have any words in their language

47
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:44,320
corresponding to the idea of people as creators. For centuries, philosophers did not consider art

48
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:49,200
to be creative, positing that the role of an artist was to simply interpret what was already

49
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:56,000
provided by nature. In the Middle Ages, creativity was heavily intertwined with religion, and artistic

50
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:01,840
spontaneity was attributed to flashes of divine inspiration. It was only during the Renaissance

51
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:06,880
when philosophers began to consider that human beings were capable of producing creative works

52
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:12,320
on their own volition. Soon enough, creative work had become a legitimate profession.

53
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:17,840
Artists achieved worldwide fame for their unmatched ability to bring their imagination to life.

54
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:23,120
By the 20th century, creative works laid the foundation for billion-dollar industries.

55
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:27,680
Entertainment media eventually became so inescapable that the tools of the trade became

56
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:33,600
accessible to just about anybody, setting up the premise of Home Movies. The story of a boy and his

57
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:39,520
camera. Throughout the show, we get to experience the adventures and misadventures of Brendan Small,

58
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:45,520
who makes movies with his friends Jason and Melissa. Brendan's parents have recently divorced,

59
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:50,240
and filmmaking provides him with a much needed escape from a turbulent period in his life.

60
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:56,160
Although his movies are far from the best, he's not afraid to keep trying. The character of

61
00:05:56,160 --> 00:06:02,320
Brendan Small is a not-so-subtle nod to series co-creator Brendan Small. Home Movies presents

62
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:07,840
a rather unique symmetry between its creators and characters. The essential conflict portrayed

63
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:14,000
within the show parallels the external conflict experienced by the show. Home Movies was not a

64
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:19,600
show for everyone, as evidenced by how few people actually watched it while it was on the air.

65
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:23,920
Those who enjoyed it likely related to the characters based on their own creative and

66
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:30,320
personal struggles. Brendan is a 21st century Charlie Brown. He's a natural underdog, grappling

67
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:36,240
with the unfairness of a world beyond his control. Within the show, Brendan's movies are not exactly

68
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:41,520
the pinnacle of filmmaking. They are often riddled with technical errors and general sloppiness

69
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:46,480
befitting of a novice who's figuring things out as they go along. But even though his movies may

70
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:52,800
appear crude, they are far from aimless. Brendan takes his filmmaking very seriously, more so than

71
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:59,360
pretty much anything else in his life. He sees his ability to make movies as his defining attribute.

72
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:04,160
It's easy for us to dismiss children's activities as inherently goofy and frivolous,

73
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:10,000
but Brendan's artistic endeavors are far more meaningful. Nothing he creates is arbitrary. Each

74
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:16,560
one of his movies has a clear vision, even if his ability to execute may be lacking. Brendan's plight

75
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:21,840
is something experienced by all creative people at one point or another. No matter how brilliant

76
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:27,040
our vision may be, we're always caught in a tug of war between imagination and feasibility.

77
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:32,160
Home Movies offers a powerful commentary on the barriers to creative fulfillment.

78
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:43,120
Our society has a somewhat paradoxical relationship with creative works.

79
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:48,320
The most illustrious artists, musicians, and movie stars are often among the most revered people in

80
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:54,480
the world. We each dedicate a significant amount of our free time engaging with creatively motivated

81
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:59,760
products like film, music, and video games. Nearly all of us would agree that these things

82
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:05,120
vastly improve our quality of life. However, despite how much we enjoy the fruits of our

83
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:10,640
most successful creators, modern society is generally unforgiving to the process it takes

84
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:16,480
to get there. For as much as powerful institutions like Dispout platitudes about the importance of

85
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:22,000
creativity, the fact of the matter is that our society is not very welcoming to creative people.

86
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:28,400
Creative ideas are inherently risky. Each innovative new solution is usually preceded by

87
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:34,160
a dozen failures. It's for this reason why the vast majority of jobs in the economy don't value

88
00:08:34,160 --> 00:08:40,400
creativity as a skill. There's no need to reinvent the wheel if the wheel itself is good enough.

89
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:45,520
When most jobs can be accomplished by mindlessly rehearsing an already proven formula,

90
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:51,360
the ability to think creatively is worthless. This is why artists who haven't hauled in gazillions in

91
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:57,120
revenue don't tend to receive much prestige. Without impressive dollar amounts to show for it,

92
00:08:57,120 --> 00:09:02,400
the value of creativity is intangible, which for the average person might as well be nothing.

93
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:08,400
Because of their perceived lack of value, creative people often find themselves being overlooked,

94
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:13,840
invalidated, or even stigmatized for their ambitions. It's an attitude all too familiar

95
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:20,000
to the creators of home movies. Back in 1999, Brendan Small and Lorne Bouchard were too young

96
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:25,360
and unproven minds looking to make something truly distinct and avant-garde. The resulting

97
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:30,080
project nearly ended up costing them a rare opportunity as success in the entertainment

98
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:35,440
industry. Both creators would eventually go on to have long and successful careers,

99
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:40,960
but if it weren't for a chance rescue from a lone network executive, their creative contributions

100
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:46,240
may have never had a chance to flourish. It's easy to recognize their skill in hindsight,

101
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:50,880
but were they really any less talented 22 years ago when their grand artistic vision

102
00:09:50,880 --> 00:10:07,520
was canceled after just five episodes? It's often difficult for us to evaluate whether any given

103
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:12,800
creative project will be successful. Bigwig Entertainment executives have the resources

104
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:18,000
to create anything they want, and most of it usually ends up sucking. Of course,

105
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:23,120
these people aren't fools. Somewhere along the way, the entertainment industry figured out that

106
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:28,880
movies and TV shows don't have to be good to make a boatload of cash. It's completely logical for

107
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:34,240
media moguls to invest their money in the 10,000 superhero reboot versus an unproven original

108
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:39,840
concept. The problem is that once all the money is made and enough time has passed, the product

109
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:46,480
that remains is not very inspiring. Logic is often antithetical to creativity, and creativity

110
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:58,000
is often antithetical to profitability. There's a reason why the most critically acclaimed art

111
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:03,600
tends to be the most niche. Truly great works are never meant to please everyone. The strength of

112
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:08,960
art lies in its power to alienate. If you want to see something new and innovative, it's going to

113
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:14,480
have to be a little alien. Prioritizing mass appeal and financial gain misses the point of

114
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:20,000
creation entirely. Historically, the greatest art has almost always come from people who have had

115
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:26,000
nothing to lose and no one to impress. By removing ourselves from the expectations and limitations

116
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:32,400
of others, we become truly free to pursue our vision. Creativity may be the ultimate exercise

117
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:37,600
in autonomy. It's an activity through which we have complete control over our domain.

118
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:43,760
Mastering the creative process requires overcoming one's limitations while retaining as much autonomy

119
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:49,600
as possible. Home Movies is a passion project, let's say, in that we fight for the things that

120
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:55,520
we think the show should be always. Both Brendan's movies and the show that encompasses them were

121
00:11:55,520 --> 00:12:01,360
heavily limited in budget and manpower, but found a way to make the most of what they had. We can

122
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:06,640
still find them endearing because there's never any question of who's in creative control. Home

123
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:12,000
Movies may not be the most polished product, but it's charming in the way it allows the personality

124
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:17,920
of its creators to shine through. Art is ultimately a metaphysical extension of the self,

125
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:24,000
meaning that just like us, it's dynamic. In a long-term creative project like a TV show,

126
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:29,920
it's intriguing to watch it evolve along with its creators. In Home Movies, there's a tangible sense

127
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:35,040
of progression through the seasons. The creators get more confident in their storytelling, the

128
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:40,400
writing becomes more sophisticated, the actors really start to settle into their characters,

129
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:45,600
even the animation noticeably improves as the show's animators develop their techniques.

130
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:52,560
When given the space to do so, art can come alive. Home Movies was fortunate to wind up on what was

131
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:58,000
the perfect destination for creative liberty. Adult Swim was the first television studio to

132
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:04,080
truly embrace experimental creator-driven content. Tragically, the vast majority of commercial

133
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:09,120
artists are given nowhere near as much freedom over their creative destiny. Perhaps the most

134
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:13,920
difficult constraint any creator faces is having to navigate through a system that fundamentally

135
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:20,480
misunderstands our goals and motivations. By and large, society is run by the creatively bankrupt,

136
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:25,920
for the simple reason that society is run by adults. Ever since the 20th century,

137
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:31,840
psychologists have attempted to empirically define and measure creativity. Across repeated

138
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:36,160
studies spanning decades, researchers found that unlike nearly every other skill,

139
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:42,160
creativity tends to decrease as we get older. When it comes to creative reasoning,

140
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:46,240
specifically divergent thinking, no one is better than children.

141
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:52,960
In 1968, George Land and Beth Jarman were commissioned by NASA to devise a creativity

142
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:59,760
test for the agency's engineers and scientists. After applying their test to nearly 300,000 adults,

143
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:06,080
they found that only 2% scored at what they defined as a genius level. Just out of curiosity,

144
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:11,440
the researchers ran the same test on a group of a thousand preschoolers. Out of this average

145
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:17,440
sample of children aged no higher than 5 years old, the amount who achieved a genius score was

146
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:24,880
98%. Somewhere along the way to adulthood, we appear to unlearn the skill of creative thinking.

147
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:31,040
Of course, there are some intuitive factors for why this happens. Children lack the knowledge or

148
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:36,240
life experience to make informed decisions, so they have to rely more on their imaginations to

149
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:41,600
make sense of the world. As we get older, we become capable of more logical reasoning,

150
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:47,360
and creativity becomes less important in our day-to-day lives. Adults are also far more

151
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:52,800
cognizant of social perception. This newfound concern over how we appear to others contributes

152
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:59,680
to possibly the biggest obstacle to creativity, fear. Specifically, the fear of failure. When we

153
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:04,000
enter adulthood, there's an expectation that we should be at least competent at what we do.

154
00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:10,560
It's often shameful to show a lack of aptitude in any given skill. Failure causes us to get

155
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:15,840
ridiculed by our peers and punished by our employers. Many adults have been conditioned

156
00:15:15,840 --> 00:15:20,880
into the mindset that failure is not an option, to such an extent that they try to eliminate the

157
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:25,920
risk of failure in even the most minor circumstances. Children, on the other hand, are not

158
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:32,000
encumbered by such strict pressure to perform. They are mostly free to try and fail as much as they

159
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:38,560
please. Creativity cannot prosper in a culture of fear and anxiety. To truly reach our creative

160
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:45,120
potential, we can't allow failure to paralyze our willingness to explore new ideas. After all, the

161
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:51,120
fastest way to improve at anything is to learn from our mistakes. Speaking of learning, one major

162
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:56,160
factor which has exacerbated the decline in creative thinking has to do with the one place

163
00:15:56,160 --> 00:16:09,600
where children are required to spend most of their time. Failing. Homework. Much, much more homework.

164
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:16,240
It's no secret that public education doesn't exactly have the best track record as of late.

165
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:21,840
As schools have grown increasingly obsessive over standardized testing, they have become notorious

166
00:16:21,840 --> 00:16:27,920
for stifling creativity. The structure of the modern education system overwhelmingly forces

167
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:33,920
students to think inside the box. School very rapidly teaches kids that their imaginations are

168
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:40,000
irrelevant. Getting good grades almost entirely depends on your ability to robotically memorize

169
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:46,400
arbitrary facts and figures. It's no wonder why so many young creative minds feel so antagonized by

170
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:51,760
modern education. As a student, you're given an ultimatum to either abandon your instinctive

171
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:57,920
curiosity or get punished for failing to conform to the system. In home movies, Brendan is a

172
00:16:57,920 --> 00:17:03,760
character who embodies this struggle. He is very clearly a bright and motivated kid, but he finds

173
00:17:03,760 --> 00:17:09,840
himself totally disconnected from conventional education. In a broader sense, this disconnect

174
00:17:09,840 --> 00:17:15,680
reflects the underlying conceit of the entire show. Home movies is not just a show about how

175
00:17:15,680 --> 00:17:22,080
kids thrive with creativity, but also how adults struggle without it. The structure of the series

176
00:17:22,080 --> 00:17:27,680
fundamentally divides its characters into two distinct groups. While the kids often soak up

177
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:33,200
the spotlight, it's the adults who provide the show's most nuanced commentary. Pretty much every

178
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:39,120
major adult character in the series suffers from a significant flaw. The tedium of adult life has

179
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:44,400
left them uninspired and unfulfilled. You get the impression that each of them has a substantial

180
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:50,080
void in their lives which they're all trying to fill. This motif is punctuated by overtones of

181
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:55,680
divorce and loneliness which linger throughout the entire series. Home movies exposes a great

182
00:17:55,680 --> 00:18:01,760
irony in the adult world's perceived superiority over children. Episodes typically feature both

183
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:06,000
children and adults dealing with a similar problem and displaying similar levels of

184
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:11,520
powerlessness to solve them. The series questions the prevailing belief that our logical adult

185
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:16,960
thinking is inherently beneficial. While concrete reasoning allows us to make good decisions,

186
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:22,560
it can simultaneously inhibit us from exploring better ones. Abundance and knowledge can make us

187
00:18:22,560 --> 00:18:27,920
more informed, but it can also make us more cynical, stubborn, and prejudicial. Home movies

188
00:18:27,920 --> 00:18:33,040
tends to portray its adult characters as being rigidly said in their own ways. They often have

189
00:18:33,040 --> 00:18:38,080
a hard time expressing their honest thoughts and opinions to others, choosing instead to remain

190
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:43,680
burdened by their own discontent. By contrast, the children of the show rarely display any of

191
00:18:43,680 --> 00:18:49,040
these characteristics. Creative thinking allows them to be far more earnest, cooperative, and

192
00:18:49,040 --> 00:18:55,200
flexible. As adults, we're used to interacting with children in a condescending way, a relationship

193
00:18:55,280 --> 00:19:00,800
that doesn't have to be so one-sided. The most harmonious moments within the series happen when

194
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:06,400
both the kids and adults engage with each other as equals. It turns out that despite everything

195
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:11,920
we know, we can still learn a thing or two from children. Don't get into show business, Josie.

196
00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:16,240
Don't spend your life being dragged down by projects that you'd lose interest in and have

197
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:26,880
to sneak away from. Where's my childhood gone, Josie? These days, creativity remains an elusive

198
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:32,720
skill in the adult world. The way our society works, most creative people won't end up being

199
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:39,840
successful. But in a strange twist of fate, the most successful people are creative. In the 1950s,

200
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:45,440
psychologist E.P. Torrance developed one of the first comprehensive tests of creative thinking.

201
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:50,400
Over the following decades, researchers began to realize that the Torrance test was a stronger

202
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:56,240
predictor of lifetime achievement than any other known method. Longitudinal research suggests that

203
00:19:56,240 --> 00:20:02,480
it is creativity, not IQ nor academic grades, which correlates the strongest with individual

204
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:11,120
success. In 2010, IBM surveyed over 1,500 CEOs from around the world and found that 60% cited

205
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:16,480
creativity as their single most important leadership quality. Great scientific minds

206
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:21,840
like Isaac Asimov and Albert Einstein have both expressed that creativity is vital in even the

207
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:28,080
most logical fields. Those who master the creative process can go as far as their imagination takes

208
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:33,840
them. For something so influential, it's a shame that so few of us actually retain it as we grow

209
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:38,960
up. Research has shown that even children are becoming less creative compared to previous

210
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:44,800
generations. In life, we take a lot of things for granted and fail to appreciate their greatness

211
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:54,240
until long after they're gone. On April 4, 2004, home movies went out on the air for the final time.

212
00:20:54,880 --> 00:21:00,720
The series made it to 52 episodes, surviving 10 times longer than its initial ill-fated run.

213
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:05,680
It exceeded pretty much every expectation that its creators could have envisioned.

214
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:12,080
But sadly, all good shows must eventually come to an end. Home movies chose to finish its run

215
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:17,280
in the only way it could. A big part of the freedom we get from creative projects is the

216
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:23,120
power to walk away. At the end of home movies, Brendan and his friends lose their passion for

217
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:29,200
making movies. As is the fate with almost all kids, they had grown past their creative endeavors.

218
00:21:29,920 --> 00:21:34,160
When it was all said and done, they realized that the movies were no longer needed.

219
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:39,600
They had served their purpose. For the first time in the series, Brendan is ready to step out from

220
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:47,680
behind the camera and into reality. Home movies was a show that was remarkably ahead of its time.

221
00:21:47,680 --> 00:21:52,640
Just one year after the series ended, we were all introduced to a little-known website called

222
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:58,640
YouTube, a place where anyone can become world famous from making home movies. Thanks to the

223
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:03,840
internet, it's never been a better time to be creative. And while many of us may have unlearned

224
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:10,400
how to think creatively, none of us ever truly forget it. If you want to reclaim your imagination,

225
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:16,320
a good place to start is learning from the case of Gerald Bostic, who, like the kids in home movies,

226
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:22,080
doesn't actually exist. They were all created by adults who remembered how to think like an

227
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:28,160
eight-year-old. As the great painter Pablo Picasso once said, all children are artists.

228
00:22:28,160 --> 00:22:31,120
The problem is how to remain an artist once we grow up.

229
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:55,920
Welcome, Rusty. I've been expecting you. Come, have a seat.

230
00:22:57,120 --> 00:22:59,920
Oh God, what are we selling this time?

231
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:04,720
What if I told you that nearly everyone you know is a slave to the system?

232
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:09,680
Have you ever looked at the world around you and had the strange feeling that something is not

233
00:23:09,680 --> 00:23:16,560
quite right? You feel it when you go to work, when you go to church, when you pay your taxes.

234
00:23:17,680 --> 00:23:23,040
Are you suggesting that we're all imprisoned in some kind of simulated reality?

235
00:23:23,040 --> 00:23:28,480
No, we are definitely in the real world. The problem is that the real world sucks,

236
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:33,680
and spineless bureaucrats make us do a bunch of annoying pointless crap like paying taxes.

237
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:38,880
You see it when you look out your window, when you turn on your television.

238
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:44,400
This society is simply unfair to people like us. So what are we supposed to do about it?

239
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:48,240
I cannot give you a harmonious solution to all of the world's problems.

240
00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:51,760
What I can offer you is a way out.

241
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:57,280
I am speaking, of course, about the Raytrix.

242
00:23:58,800 --> 00:24:00,160
The Raytrix?

243
00:24:00,160 --> 00:24:03,520
Rusty, have you ever heard of the term sigma male?

244
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:05,680
I'm not sure I have.

245
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:11,280
Most unfortunate souls are born into this world to be nothing more than sheeple.

246
00:24:11,280 --> 00:24:16,800
Fools who will gladly pay outrageous prices for premium wireless earbuds without even a

247
00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:22,720
second thought. It is the wool that has been pulled over your ears to deafen you from the truth.

248
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:26,960
However, the sigmas of the world reject this premise.

249
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:31,680
They recognize that there is an alternative to other premium audio brands that starts

250
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:32,960
at just half the price.

251
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:34,480
No way.

252
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:35,360
You can't mean-

253
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:41,760
That is correct. I'm referring to Raycon earbuds, your key to unlocking the Raytrix.

254
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:47,120
With this state-of-the-art technology, you can tune out the stupidity of the world around you,

255
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:49,280
anywhere, at any time.

256
00:24:49,280 --> 00:24:54,480
Let the sheeple graze on the lies of the system which imprisons them, while you bask in the

257
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:59,760
amazing audio quality of the Raytrix, free from the shackles of our noisy society.

258
00:25:00,800 --> 00:25:04,080
Rusty, I've always suspected that you are a true sigma.

259
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:06,880
Now is the time to prove it.

260
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:10,400
Of course, no one can be told what the Raytrix is.

261
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:12,560
You have to hear it for yourself.

262
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:15,120
This is your last chance.

263
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:18,000
After this, there is no turning back.

264
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:24,400
You take the blue pill, the story ends, you wake up in your bed, and go back to paying

265
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:27,120
whatever other premium audio brands want to charge you.

266
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:33,760
You take the red pill, you stay in Wonderland, and I show you how far downward the spiral goes.

267
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:48,080
What if I told you that you can purchase your own

268
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:54,720
pair of Raycon Everyday Earbuds by visiting buyraycon.com or by visiting the link in the

277
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:47,440
That's what I keep telling them.

278
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:51,120
Home Movies premieres in two weeks on UPS.
