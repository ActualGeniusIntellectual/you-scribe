00:00.000 --> 00:04.960
So, last week I uploaded a video where I basically tear into all of the crap that YouTube has

00:04.960 --> 00:07.800
allowed to happen to its creators over the past year.

00:07.800 --> 00:12.640
My goal with this video was to spread awareness about YouTube's severe flaws, since I feel

00:12.640 --> 00:17.560
like not enough people out there truly realize just how bad the situation on YouTube has

00:17.560 --> 00:18.560
become.

00:18.560 --> 00:22.640
And in the few days after I uploaded this video, a lot of interesting things happened.

00:22.640 --> 00:25.600
First of all, the YouTube Rewind got hammered this year.

00:25.600 --> 00:30.680
In a few days, it was already in the top 25 most disliked videos of all time on YouTube.

00:30.680 --> 00:35.460
You had multiple big YouTubers coming out and criticizing the Rewind, and you even had

00:35.460 --> 00:40.160
people who were in the Rewind coming out and giving some fairly damning reports about how

00:40.160 --> 00:41.880
YouTube mistreated them.

00:41.880 --> 00:43.560
And I'm really glad to see all of this.

00:43.560 --> 00:48.880
It seems like tons of people are finally waking up and seeing through YouTube's tricks.

00:48.880 --> 00:53.720
I'm really glad so many people out there are coming out and disliking the Rewind on their

00:53.720 --> 00:58.600
own because I'm pretty sure that YouTube tried to prevent my message from getting out

00:58.600 --> 01:03.520
to the public.

01:03.520 --> 01:05.480
So let me explain my observations.

01:05.480 --> 01:09.960
Within the first two days of me uploading my video, the video received around 100,000

01:09.960 --> 01:13.100
views, which is admittedly better than most of my uploads.

01:13.100 --> 01:17.500
The engagement numbers for this video were really good, as in the most likes I had ever

01:17.500 --> 01:20.520
received on a video with only 100,000 views.

01:20.520 --> 01:27.100
This archived screenshot shows my video with around 107,000 views and almost 20,000 likes.

01:27.100 --> 01:31.280
Over 18% of the people who watched the video to this point pressed the like button.

01:31.280 --> 01:35.840
You'd be hard pressed to find a view-to-like ratio as high as that anywhere on YouTube.

01:35.840 --> 01:40.360
Now like I said, this video did really well for about two and a half days after I uploaded

01:40.360 --> 01:41.360
it.

01:41.360 --> 01:44.440
And then, all of a sudden, it was like the video hit a brick wall.

01:44.440 --> 01:48.880
Now normally this wouldn't be cause for concern since this is how my video analytics usually

01:48.880 --> 01:49.880
look.

01:50.120 --> 01:54.780
Every video I upload gets the most views on day one, and then the view count slowly trails

01:54.780 --> 01:56.000
off afterwards.

01:56.000 --> 01:59.680
So like I said, I would expect these numbers under normal circumstances.

01:59.680 --> 02:04.540
However, these are not normal circumstances because three days after I uploaded this video,

02:04.540 --> 02:08.960
I start to see all sorts of other YouTube Rewind-related videos blowing up in my recommended.

02:08.960 --> 02:14.180
I keep seeing these videos get tons of views, hundreds of thousands of more views than my

02:14.180 --> 02:15.180
video.

02:15.180 --> 02:18.240
So at this point, I just think that these videos are getting so many more views than

02:18.240 --> 02:21.480
mine because they're just simple compilations.

02:21.480 --> 02:27.920
And let's face it, if you're talking about YouTube after 2014, people love their compilations.

02:27.920 --> 02:32.000
So I figured that people weren't clicking on my video because it's over 20 minutes long

02:32.000 --> 02:35.880
and the average YouTube viewers are too impatient to watch videos that long.

02:35.880 --> 02:39.000
But then I thought about it some more and something just didn't add up.

02:39.000 --> 02:42.680
My most viewed video this year was 32 minutes long.

02:42.680 --> 02:48.120
So the idea that people don't like to click on long videos just didn't make any sense.

02:48.120 --> 02:53.160
And besides, among the YouTube Rewind responses getting tons of views was a 17-minute video

02:53.160 --> 02:54.960
and a 32-minute video.

02:54.960 --> 02:59.080
And in addition to that, hasn't YouTube drilled into our heads over the past few years that

02:59.080 --> 03:03.840
watch time is the single most important metric in determining a video's search and discovery?

03:03.840 --> 03:08.760
Well, in the first two days that my video was online, it got over 1 million minutes

03:08.760 --> 03:09.880
of watch time.

03:09.880 --> 03:15.220
So you'd think that a video with this much watch time and this much viewer engagement

03:15.220 --> 03:18.700
should appear in a ton of people's recommended sections.

03:18.700 --> 03:23.380
Because after all, the YouTube Rewind was a huge topic that tons of people were discussing

03:23.380 --> 03:24.940
all over YouTube.

03:24.940 --> 03:29.620
If you look at the public stats of other videos on the topic, they all showed huge jumps and

03:29.620 --> 03:31.740
views around three days after they were uploaded.

03:31.740 --> 03:36.640
And that makes perfect sense because the algorithm is recommending those videos to a trend that

03:36.640 --> 03:38.780
has a high demand for viewership.

03:38.780 --> 03:42.940
Yet when you compare these stats with my video, it's the complete opposite case.

03:42.940 --> 03:44.740
So what exactly is going on here?

03:44.740 --> 03:49.180
Well, the reason becomes clear when you dig into the specifics of my analytics.

03:49.180 --> 03:54.380
I discovered that less than 20% of the views on this video are coming from suggested videos

03:54.380 --> 03:55.380
on YouTube.

03:55.380 --> 04:00.700
In fact, this video has had fewer views from suggested videos than it's earned from unknown

04:00.700 --> 04:01.700
sources.

04:01.700 --> 04:07.020
To compare, I contacted fellow YouTuber, Pye, who made one of the YouTube Rewind videos

04:07.020 --> 04:08.880
that blew up in popularity.

04:08.880 --> 04:14.660
He sent me his advanced analytics and boom, there it is, 77% views from suggested videos.

04:15.100 --> 04:21.380
Even if you look at my channel average from last month, which was 45% views from suggested

04:21.380 --> 04:26.420
videos, it's still significantly higher than what my YouTube Rewind video received.

04:26.420 --> 04:32.300
Based on this evidence, I must reasonably suspect that YouTube interfered with my video's

04:32.300 --> 04:33.940
search and discovery metric.

04:33.940 --> 04:38.900
I can't think of any other explanation for why my video performed so poorly after that

04:38.900 --> 04:39.900
third day.

04:40.040 --> 04:45.020
It was a video about a trending topic that earned a ton of watch time over the first

04:45.020 --> 04:51.140
two days, and yet despite those clearly successful video traits, YouTube barely promoted my video

04:51.140 --> 04:53.140
in anyone's recommendations.

04:53.140 --> 04:56.780
And if any of you have different theories as to what happened, I'd love to hear them.

04:56.780 --> 05:01.900
But for now, I have no choice but to infer that YouTube covertly reduced the extent to

05:01.900 --> 05:04.180
which the algorithm promoted my video.

05:04.180 --> 05:09.020
In other words, they censored my video from appearing in most people's recommendations.

05:09.020 --> 05:10.700
So why did they censor it?

05:15.260 --> 05:19.620
First let me start by saying that I've recently become aware of the inner workings of YouTube

05:19.620 --> 05:22.740
thanks to these fantastic videos by Cielo.

05:22.740 --> 05:28.080
This guy basically conducted a comprehensive study of demonetized YouTube videos to identify

05:28.080 --> 05:31.740
some sort of trend affecting their search and discovery in the algorithm.

05:31.740 --> 05:36.780
And what he found embedded in the source codes of demonetized videos was this line labeled

05:36.780 --> 05:41.060
excluded ads followed by a string of several codes.

05:41.060 --> 05:45.580
Through his research, Cielo began to connect some of the numbers with the parameters outlined

05:45.580 --> 05:48.260
in Google's advertiser-friendly guidelines.

05:48.260 --> 05:53.740
He then correlated these codes with the amount by which each demonetized video appeared in

05:53.740 --> 05:59.940
YouTube's related videos, and he identified a clear trend demonstrating that these three-digit

05:59.940 --> 06:04.500
codes negatively affected how much the algorithm promotes videos.

06:04.500 --> 06:09.700
Basically, he found extensive evidence that if your video gets demonetized within any

06:09.700 --> 06:14.460
of these parameters, YouTube will promote it significantly less than they would for

06:14.460 --> 06:20.780
normal videos, effectively censoring content that the algorithm views as not friendly for

06:20.780 --> 06:22.120
advertisers.

06:22.120 --> 06:26.620
Even though Cielo's original videos on the subject have relatively few views, I believe

06:26.620 --> 06:29.620
that his findings are completely legitimate.

06:29.620 --> 06:31.940
YouTube openly rejected this claim on Twitter.

06:31.940 --> 06:36.220
However, I believe that Cielo was definitely onto something, because within a few days

06:36.220 --> 06:41.760
of him posting the findings of his research, YouTube hid excluded ads from the viewable

06:41.760 --> 06:43.780
source code of videos.

06:43.780 --> 06:49.080
This was incredibly suspicious, as it appears that YouTube was trying to hide something

06:49.080 --> 06:50.940
that they didn't want us to see.

06:50.940 --> 06:55.660
But with that being said, and based on the new information I've observed, I think that

06:55.660 --> 06:58.600
YouTube's tweet here is actually telling the truth.

06:58.600 --> 07:02.520
In this tweet, YouTube practically admits to censoring videos that don't fit into

07:02.520 --> 07:04.400
their advertiser-friendly guidelines.

07:04.400 --> 07:08.480
They claim that this censorship is not related to the monetization system.

07:08.480 --> 07:14.460
However, I believe that censorship and demonetization on YouTube are just two heads of the same

07:14.460 --> 07:15.640
beast.

07:15.640 --> 07:18.880
So here are the observations that led me to this conclusion.

07:18.880 --> 07:25.080
In my video about the YouTube Rewind, I played the PewDiePie N-Bomb clip raw and uncensored.

07:25.080 --> 07:30.400
In a separate study conducted by Cielo about the demonetization bot, he found substantial

07:30.400 --> 07:35.380
evidence that YouTube scans the automatically generated captions of your videos in order

07:35.380 --> 07:38.200
to determine if it is suitable for advertisers.

07:38.200 --> 07:42.560
Cielo found that keywords like these in the captions of the videos resulted in them being

07:42.560 --> 07:44.960
demonetized 100% of the time.

07:44.960 --> 07:49.360
But here's the thing though, my YouTube Rewind video was never monetized.

07:49.360 --> 07:54.460
I preemptively made this decision so that YouTube would not censor its search and discovery.

07:54.460 --> 07:57.460
But as I demonstrated, that's exactly what happened.

07:57.460 --> 08:02.340
If my video was never monetized, then how could the algorithm still know to censor it?

08:02.340 --> 08:07.140
The only explanation I have is that YouTube has a separate but similar bot that scans

08:07.140 --> 08:14.100
all videos, regardless of demonetization, for metadata that violates ad-friendly guidelines.

08:14.100 --> 08:16.620
That must be what they are referring to in this tweet.

08:16.620 --> 08:17.620
And what do you know?

08:17.620 --> 08:20.640
I dug deeper into my analytics and found this.

08:20.640 --> 08:26.760
One single lone view from a source labeled YouTube Advertising, which is odd since my

08:26.760 --> 08:30.000
video never had any ads running on it.

08:30.000 --> 08:35.100
And it just so happens that whatever this thing is viewed my video on December 8th,

08:35.100 --> 08:38.680
the same time that my video performance started to suffer.

08:38.680 --> 08:43.280
I don't exactly know what I've uncovered here, but one thing's for sure, there's

08:43.280 --> 08:47.520
a bunch of stuff going on behind the scenes that YouTube's not telling us.

08:47.680 --> 08:53.800
And this system that YouTube has implemented runs far deeper than just demonetization.

08:53.800 --> 08:56.200
I understand where YouTube is coming from here.

08:56.200 --> 09:00.880
They're ultimately a business, and they're technically allowed to patrol whatever content

09:00.880 --> 09:02.200
they want on their site.

09:02.200 --> 09:06.960
They already block videos that violate copyright or their terms of service, and they have done

09:06.960 --> 09:07.960
so for years.

09:07.960 --> 09:13.640
However, YouTube's new form of censorship extends far beyond legal safekeeping.

09:13.640 --> 09:19.300
This new censorship treads on what users can and cannot openly say on the platform.

09:19.300 --> 09:21.280
This is about YouTube's image.

09:21.280 --> 09:24.460
This is about limiting speech that they disagree with.

09:24.460 --> 09:28.560
And even though the majority of people would likely agree that the speech they chose to

09:28.560 --> 09:33.440
censor is reprehensible, it raises several important questions.

09:33.440 --> 09:37.940
Is it ethical to censor discussion in the name of reducing obscenity?

09:37.940 --> 09:42.040
Is it fair to limit the performance of controversial videos?

09:42.040 --> 09:46.820
And finally, is this setting a dangerous precedent for the future of content creation

09:46.820 --> 09:48.320
on YouTube?

09:48.320 --> 09:52.700
These are the issues we must seriously discuss moving forward.

09:52.700 --> 09:58.800
But for now, let's just sit back and enjoy the holidays, as all the giant ruthless corporations

09:58.800 --> 10:04.400
in our lives get the gift of having even more power over the pathetic masses.

10:12.040 --> 10:26.840
Well I'll be, I'll be so blue, I'll stake it all over the view.

10:26.840 --> 10:38.520
Decoration's over, all I'll dream Christmas dreams.

10:38.520 --> 10:44.360
I'll be the same thing if you're not here with me.
