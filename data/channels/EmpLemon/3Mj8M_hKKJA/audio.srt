00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,960
So, last week I uploaded a video where I basically tear into all of the crap that YouTube has

2
00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:07,800
allowed to happen to its creators over the past year.

3
00:00:07,800 --> 00:00:12,640
My goal with this video was to spread awareness about YouTube's severe flaws, since I feel

4
00:00:12,640 --> 00:00:17,560
like not enough people out there truly realize just how bad the situation on YouTube has

5
00:00:17,560 --> 00:00:18,560
become.

6
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:22,640
And in the few days after I uploaded this video, a lot of interesting things happened.

7
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:25,600
First of all, the YouTube Rewind got hammered this year.

8
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:30,680
In a few days, it was already in the top 25 most disliked videos of all time on YouTube.

9
00:00:30,680 --> 00:00:35,460
You had multiple big YouTubers coming out and criticizing the Rewind, and you even had

10
00:00:35,460 --> 00:00:40,160
people who were in the Rewind coming out and giving some fairly damning reports about how

11
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:41,880
YouTube mistreated them.

12
00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:43,560
And I'm really glad to see all of this.

13
00:00:43,560 --> 00:00:48,880
It seems like tons of people are finally waking up and seeing through YouTube's tricks.

14
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:53,720
I'm really glad so many people out there are coming out and disliking the Rewind on their

15
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:58,600
own because I'm pretty sure that YouTube tried to prevent my message from getting out

16
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:03,520
to the public.

17
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:05,480
So let me explain my observations.

18
00:01:05,480 --> 00:01:09,960
Within the first two days of me uploading my video, the video received around 100,000

19
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:13,100
views, which is admittedly better than most of my uploads.

20
00:01:13,100 --> 00:01:17,500
The engagement numbers for this video were really good, as in the most likes I had ever

21
00:01:17,500 --> 00:01:20,520
received on a video with only 100,000 views.

22
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:27,100
This archived screenshot shows my video with around 107,000 views and almost 20,000 likes.

23
00:01:27,100 --> 00:01:31,280
Over 18% of the people who watched the video to this point pressed the like button.

24
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:35,840
You'd be hard pressed to find a view-to-like ratio as high as that anywhere on YouTube.

25
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:40,360
Now like I said, this video did really well for about two and a half days after I uploaded

26
00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:41,360
it.

27
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:44,440
And then, all of a sudden, it was like the video hit a brick wall.

28
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:48,880
Now normally this wouldn't be cause for concern since this is how my video analytics usually

29
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:49,880
look.

30
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:54,780
Every video I upload gets the most views on day one, and then the view count slowly trails

31
00:01:54,780 --> 00:01:56,000
off afterwards.

32
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,680
So like I said, I would expect these numbers under normal circumstances.

33
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:04,540
However, these are not normal circumstances because three days after I uploaded this video,

34
00:02:04,540 --> 00:02:08,960
I start to see all sorts of other YouTube Rewind-related videos blowing up in my recommended.

35
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:14,180
I keep seeing these videos get tons of views, hundreds of thousands of more views than my

36
00:02:14,180 --> 00:02:15,180
video.

37
00:02:15,180 --> 00:02:18,240
So at this point, I just think that these videos are getting so many more views than

38
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:21,480
mine because they're just simple compilations.

39
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:27,920
And let's face it, if you're talking about YouTube after 2014, people love their compilations.

40
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:32,000
So I figured that people weren't clicking on my video because it's over 20 minutes long

41
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:35,880
and the average YouTube viewers are too impatient to watch videos that long.

42
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:39,000
But then I thought about it some more and something just didn't add up.

43
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,680
My most viewed video this year was 32 minutes long.

44
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:48,120
So the idea that people don't like to click on long videos just didn't make any sense.

45
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:53,160
And besides, among the YouTube Rewind responses getting tons of views was a 17-minute video

46
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:54,960
and a 32-minute video.

47
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:59,080
And in addition to that, hasn't YouTube drilled into our heads over the past few years that

48
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:03,840
watch time is the single most important metric in determining a video's search and discovery?

49
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:08,760
Well, in the first two days that my video was online, it got over 1 million minutes

50
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:09,880
of watch time.

51
00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:15,220
So you'd think that a video with this much watch time and this much viewer engagement

52
00:03:15,220 --> 00:03:18,700
should appear in a ton of people's recommended sections.

53
00:03:18,700 --> 00:03:23,380
Because after all, the YouTube Rewind was a huge topic that tons of people were discussing

54
00:03:23,380 --> 00:03:24,940
all over YouTube.

55
00:03:24,940 --> 00:03:29,620
If you look at the public stats of other videos on the topic, they all showed huge jumps and

56
00:03:29,620 --> 00:03:31,740
views around three days after they were uploaded.

57
00:03:31,740 --> 00:03:36,640
And that makes perfect sense because the algorithm is recommending those videos to a trend that

58
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:38,780
has a high demand for viewership.

59
00:03:38,780 --> 00:03:42,940
Yet when you compare these stats with my video, it's the complete opposite case.

60
00:03:42,940 --> 00:03:44,740
So what exactly is going on here?

61
00:03:44,740 --> 00:03:49,180
Well, the reason becomes clear when you dig into the specifics of my analytics.

62
00:03:49,180 --> 00:03:54,380
I discovered that less than 20% of the views on this video are coming from suggested videos

63
00:03:54,380 --> 00:03:55,380
on YouTube.

64
00:03:55,380 --> 00:04:00,700
In fact, this video has had fewer views from suggested videos than it's earned from unknown

65
00:04:00,700 --> 00:04:01,700
sources.

66
00:04:01,700 --> 00:04:07,020
To compare, I contacted fellow YouTuber, Pye, who made one of the YouTube Rewind videos

67
00:04:07,020 --> 00:04:08,880
that blew up in popularity.

68
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:14,660
He sent me his advanced analytics and boom, there it is, 77% views from suggested videos.

69
00:04:15,100 --> 00:04:21,380
Even if you look at my channel average from last month, which was 45% views from suggested

70
00:04:21,380 --> 00:04:26,420
videos, it's still significantly higher than what my YouTube Rewind video received.

71
00:04:26,420 --> 00:04:32,300
Based on this evidence, I must reasonably suspect that YouTube interfered with my video's

72
00:04:32,300 --> 00:04:33,940
search and discovery metric.

73
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:38,900
I can't think of any other explanation for why my video performed so poorly after that

74
00:04:38,900 --> 00:04:39,900
third day.

75
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:45,020
It was a video about a trending topic that earned a ton of watch time over the first

76
00:04:45,020 --> 00:04:51,140
two days, and yet despite those clearly successful video traits, YouTube barely promoted my video

77
00:04:51,140 --> 00:04:53,140
in anyone's recommendations.

78
00:04:53,140 --> 00:04:56,780
And if any of you have different theories as to what happened, I'd love to hear them.

79
00:04:56,780 --> 00:05:01,900
But for now, I have no choice but to infer that YouTube covertly reduced the extent to

80
00:05:01,900 --> 00:05:04,180
which the algorithm promoted my video.

81
00:05:04,180 --> 00:05:09,020
In other words, they censored my video from appearing in most people's recommendations.

82
00:05:09,020 --> 00:05:10,700
So why did they censor it?

83
00:05:15,260 --> 00:05:19,620
First let me start by saying that I've recently become aware of the inner workings of YouTube

84
00:05:19,620 --> 00:05:22,740
thanks to these fantastic videos by Cielo.

85
00:05:22,740 --> 00:05:28,080
This guy basically conducted a comprehensive study of demonetized YouTube videos to identify

86
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:31,740
some sort of trend affecting their search and discovery in the algorithm.

87
00:05:31,740 --> 00:05:36,780
And what he found embedded in the source codes of demonetized videos was this line labeled

88
00:05:36,780 --> 00:05:41,060
excluded ads followed by a string of several codes.

89
00:05:41,060 --> 00:05:45,580
Through his research, Cielo began to connect some of the numbers with the parameters outlined

90
00:05:45,580 --> 00:05:48,260
in Google's advertiser-friendly guidelines.

91
00:05:48,260 --> 00:05:53,740
He then correlated these codes with the amount by which each demonetized video appeared in

92
00:05:53,740 --> 00:05:59,940
YouTube's related videos, and he identified a clear trend demonstrating that these three-digit

93
00:05:59,940 --> 00:06:04,500
codes negatively affected how much the algorithm promotes videos.

94
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:09,700
Basically, he found extensive evidence that if your video gets demonetized within any

95
00:06:09,700 --> 00:06:14,460
of these parameters, YouTube will promote it significantly less than they would for

96
00:06:14,460 --> 00:06:20,780
normal videos, effectively censoring content that the algorithm views as not friendly for

97
00:06:20,780 --> 00:06:22,120
advertisers.

98
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:26,620
Even though Cielo's original videos on the subject have relatively few views, I believe

99
00:06:26,620 --> 00:06:29,620
that his findings are completely legitimate.

100
00:06:29,620 --> 00:06:31,940
YouTube openly rejected this claim on Twitter.

101
00:06:31,940 --> 00:06:36,220
However, I believe that Cielo was definitely onto something, because within a few days

102
00:06:36,220 --> 00:06:41,760
of him posting the findings of his research, YouTube hid excluded ads from the viewable

103
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:43,780
source code of videos.

104
00:06:43,780 --> 00:06:49,080
This was incredibly suspicious, as it appears that YouTube was trying to hide something

105
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:50,940
that they didn't want us to see.

106
00:06:50,940 --> 00:06:55,660
But with that being said, and based on the new information I've observed, I think that

107
00:06:55,660 --> 00:06:58,600
YouTube's tweet here is actually telling the truth.

108
00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:02,520
In this tweet, YouTube practically admits to censoring videos that don't fit into

109
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:04,400
their advertiser-friendly guidelines.

110
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:08,480
They claim that this censorship is not related to the monetization system.

111
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:14,460
However, I believe that censorship and demonetization on YouTube are just two heads of the same

112
00:07:14,460 --> 00:07:15,640
beast.

113
00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:18,880
So here are the observations that led me to this conclusion.

114
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:25,080
In my video about the YouTube Rewind, I played the PewDiePie N-Bomb clip raw and uncensored.

115
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:30,400
In a separate study conducted by Cielo about the demonetization bot, he found substantial

116
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:35,380
evidence that YouTube scans the automatically generated captions of your videos in order

117
00:07:35,380 --> 00:07:38,200
to determine if it is suitable for advertisers.

118
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:42,560
Cielo found that keywords like these in the captions of the videos resulted in them being

119
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:44,960
demonetized 100% of the time.

120
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:49,360
But here's the thing though, my YouTube Rewind video was never monetized.

121
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:54,460
I preemptively made this decision so that YouTube would not censor its search and discovery.

122
00:07:54,460 --> 00:07:57,460
But as I demonstrated, that's exactly what happened.

123
00:07:57,460 --> 00:08:02,340
If my video was never monetized, then how could the algorithm still know to censor it?

124
00:08:02,340 --> 00:08:07,140
The only explanation I have is that YouTube has a separate but similar bot that scans

125
00:08:07,140 --> 00:08:14,100
all videos, regardless of demonetization, for metadata that violates ad-friendly guidelines.

126
00:08:14,100 --> 00:08:16,620
That must be what they are referring to in this tweet.

127
00:08:16,620 --> 00:08:17,620
And what do you know?

128
00:08:17,620 --> 00:08:20,640
I dug deeper into my analytics and found this.

129
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:26,760
One single lone view from a source labeled YouTube Advertising, which is odd since my

130
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:30,000
video never had any ads running on it.

131
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:35,100
And it just so happens that whatever this thing is viewed my video on December 8th,

132
00:08:35,100 --> 00:08:38,680
the same time that my video performance started to suffer.

133
00:08:38,680 --> 00:08:43,280
I don't exactly know what I've uncovered here, but one thing's for sure, there's

134
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:47,520
a bunch of stuff going on behind the scenes that YouTube's not telling us.

135
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:53,800
And this system that YouTube has implemented runs far deeper than just demonetization.

136
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:56,200
I understand where YouTube is coming from here.

137
00:08:56,200 --> 00:09:00,880
They're ultimately a business, and they're technically allowed to patrol whatever content

138
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:02,200
they want on their site.

139
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:06,960
They already block videos that violate copyright or their terms of service, and they have done

140
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:07,960
so for years.

141
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:13,640
However, YouTube's new form of censorship extends far beyond legal safekeeping.

142
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:19,300
This new censorship treads on what users can and cannot openly say on the platform.

143
00:09:19,300 --> 00:09:21,280
This is about YouTube's image.

144
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:24,460
This is about limiting speech that they disagree with.

145
00:09:24,460 --> 00:09:28,560
And even though the majority of people would likely agree that the speech they chose to

146
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:33,440
censor is reprehensible, it raises several important questions.

147
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:37,940
Is it ethical to censor discussion in the name of reducing obscenity?

148
00:09:37,940 --> 00:09:42,040
Is it fair to limit the performance of controversial videos?

149
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:46,820
And finally, is this setting a dangerous precedent for the future of content creation

150
00:09:46,820 --> 00:09:48,320
on YouTube?

151
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:52,700
These are the issues we must seriously discuss moving forward.

152
00:09:52,700 --> 00:09:58,800
But for now, let's just sit back and enjoy the holidays, as all the giant ruthless corporations

153
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:04,400
in our lives get the gift of having even more power over the pathetic masses.

154
00:10:12,040 --> 00:10:26,840
Well I'll be, I'll be so blue, I'll stake it all over the view.

155
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:38,520
Decoration's over, all I'll dream Christmas dreams.

156
00:10:38,520 --> 00:10:44,360
I'll be the same thing if you're not here with me.
