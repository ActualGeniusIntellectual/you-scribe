0	4960	So, last week I uploaded a video where I basically tear into all of the crap that YouTube has
4960	7800	allowed to happen to its creators over the past year.
7800	12640	My goal with this video was to spread awareness about YouTube's severe flaws, since I feel
12640	17560	like not enough people out there truly realize just how bad the situation on YouTube has
17560	18560	become.
18560	22640	And in the few days after I uploaded this video, a lot of interesting things happened.
22640	25600	First of all, the YouTube Rewind got hammered this year.
25600	30680	In a few days, it was already in the top 25 most disliked videos of all time on YouTube.
30680	35460	You had multiple big YouTubers coming out and criticizing the Rewind, and you even had
35460	40160	people who were in the Rewind coming out and giving some fairly damning reports about how
40160	41880	YouTube mistreated them.
41880	43560	And I'm really glad to see all of this.
43560	48880	It seems like tons of people are finally waking up and seeing through YouTube's tricks.
48880	53720	I'm really glad so many people out there are coming out and disliking the Rewind on their
53720	58600	own because I'm pretty sure that YouTube tried to prevent my message from getting out
58600	63520	to the public.
63520	65480	So let me explain my observations.
65480	69960	Within the first two days of me uploading my video, the video received around 100,000
69960	73100	views, which is admittedly better than most of my uploads.
73100	77500	The engagement numbers for this video were really good, as in the most likes I had ever
77500	80520	received on a video with only 100,000 views.
80520	87100	This archived screenshot shows my video with around 107,000 views and almost 20,000 likes.
87100	91280	Over 18% of the people who watched the video to this point pressed the like button.
91280	95840	You'd be hard pressed to find a view-to-like ratio as high as that anywhere on YouTube.
95840	100360	Now like I said, this video did really well for about two and a half days after I uploaded
100360	101360	it.
101360	104440	And then, all of a sudden, it was like the video hit a brick wall.
104440	108880	Now normally this wouldn't be cause for concern since this is how my video analytics usually
108880	109880	look.
110120	114780	Every video I upload gets the most views on day one, and then the view count slowly trails
114780	116000	off afterwards.
116000	119680	So like I said, I would expect these numbers under normal circumstances.
119680	124540	However, these are not normal circumstances because three days after I uploaded this video,
124540	128960	I start to see all sorts of other YouTube Rewind-related videos blowing up in my recommended.
128960	134180	I keep seeing these videos get tons of views, hundreds of thousands of more views than my
134180	135180	video.
135180	138240	So at this point, I just think that these videos are getting so many more views than
138240	141480	mine because they're just simple compilations.
141480	147920	And let's face it, if you're talking about YouTube after 2014, people love their compilations.
147920	152000	So I figured that people weren't clicking on my video because it's over 20 minutes long
152000	155880	and the average YouTube viewers are too impatient to watch videos that long.
155880	159000	But then I thought about it some more and something just didn't add up.
159000	162680	My most viewed video this year was 32 minutes long.
162680	168120	So the idea that people don't like to click on long videos just didn't make any sense.
168120	173160	And besides, among the YouTube Rewind responses getting tons of views was a 17-minute video
173160	174960	and a 32-minute video.
174960	179080	And in addition to that, hasn't YouTube drilled into our heads over the past few years that
179080	183840	watch time is the single most important metric in determining a video's search and discovery?
183840	188760	Well, in the first two days that my video was online, it got over 1 million minutes
188760	189880	of watch time.
189880	195220	So you'd think that a video with this much watch time and this much viewer engagement
195220	198700	should appear in a ton of people's recommended sections.
198700	203380	Because after all, the YouTube Rewind was a huge topic that tons of people were discussing
203380	204940	all over YouTube.
204940	209620	If you look at the public stats of other videos on the topic, they all showed huge jumps and
209620	211740	views around three days after they were uploaded.
211740	216640	And that makes perfect sense because the algorithm is recommending those videos to a trend that
216640	218780	has a high demand for viewership.
218780	222940	Yet when you compare these stats with my video, it's the complete opposite case.
222940	224740	So what exactly is going on here?
224740	229180	Well, the reason becomes clear when you dig into the specifics of my analytics.
229180	234380	I discovered that less than 20% of the views on this video are coming from suggested videos
234380	235380	on YouTube.
235380	240700	In fact, this video has had fewer views from suggested videos than it's earned from unknown
240700	241700	sources.
241700	247020	To compare, I contacted fellow YouTuber, Pye, who made one of the YouTube Rewind videos
247020	248880	that blew up in popularity.
248880	254660	He sent me his advanced analytics and boom, there it is, 77% views from suggested videos.
255100	261380	Even if you look at my channel average from last month, which was 45% views from suggested
261380	266420	videos, it's still significantly higher than what my YouTube Rewind video received.
266420	272300	Based on this evidence, I must reasonably suspect that YouTube interfered with my video's
272300	273940	search and discovery metric.
273940	278900	I can't think of any other explanation for why my video performed so poorly after that
278900	279900	third day.
280040	285020	It was a video about a trending topic that earned a ton of watch time over the first
285020	291140	two days, and yet despite those clearly successful video traits, YouTube barely promoted my video
291140	293140	in anyone's recommendations.
293140	296780	And if any of you have different theories as to what happened, I'd love to hear them.
296780	301900	But for now, I have no choice but to infer that YouTube covertly reduced the extent to
301900	304180	which the algorithm promoted my video.
304180	309020	In other words, they censored my video from appearing in most people's recommendations.
309020	310700	So why did they censor it?
315260	319620	First let me start by saying that I've recently become aware of the inner workings of YouTube
319620	322740	thanks to these fantastic videos by Cielo.
322740	328080	This guy basically conducted a comprehensive study of demonetized YouTube videos to identify
328080	331740	some sort of trend affecting their search and discovery in the algorithm.
331740	336780	And what he found embedded in the source codes of demonetized videos was this line labeled
336780	341060	excluded ads followed by a string of several codes.
341060	345580	Through his research, Cielo began to connect some of the numbers with the parameters outlined
345580	348260	in Google's advertiser-friendly guidelines.
348260	353740	He then correlated these codes with the amount by which each demonetized video appeared in
353740	359940	YouTube's related videos, and he identified a clear trend demonstrating that these three-digit
359940	364500	codes negatively affected how much the algorithm promotes videos.
364500	369700	Basically, he found extensive evidence that if your video gets demonetized within any
369700	374460	of these parameters, YouTube will promote it significantly less than they would for
374460	380780	normal videos, effectively censoring content that the algorithm views as not friendly for
380780	382120	advertisers.
382120	386620	Even though Cielo's original videos on the subject have relatively few views, I believe
386620	389620	that his findings are completely legitimate.
389620	391940	YouTube openly rejected this claim on Twitter.
391940	396220	However, I believe that Cielo was definitely onto something, because within a few days
396220	401760	of him posting the findings of his research, YouTube hid excluded ads from the viewable
401760	403780	source code of videos.
403780	409080	This was incredibly suspicious, as it appears that YouTube was trying to hide something
409080	410940	that they didn't want us to see.
410940	415660	But with that being said, and based on the new information I've observed, I think that
415660	418600	YouTube's tweet here is actually telling the truth.
418600	422520	In this tweet, YouTube practically admits to censoring videos that don't fit into
422520	424400	their advertiser-friendly guidelines.
424400	428480	They claim that this censorship is not related to the monetization system.
428480	434460	However, I believe that censorship and demonetization on YouTube are just two heads of the same
434460	435640	beast.
435640	438880	So here are the observations that led me to this conclusion.
438880	445080	In my video about the YouTube Rewind, I played the PewDiePie N-Bomb clip raw and uncensored.
445080	450400	In a separate study conducted by Cielo about the demonetization bot, he found substantial
450400	455380	evidence that YouTube scans the automatically generated captions of your videos in order
455380	458200	to determine if it is suitable for advertisers.
458200	462560	Cielo found that keywords like these in the captions of the videos resulted in them being
462560	464960	demonetized 100% of the time.
464960	469360	But here's the thing though, my YouTube Rewind video was never monetized.
469360	474460	I preemptively made this decision so that YouTube would not censor its search and discovery.
474460	477460	But as I demonstrated, that's exactly what happened.
477460	482340	If my video was never monetized, then how could the algorithm still know to censor it?
482340	487140	The only explanation I have is that YouTube has a separate but similar bot that scans
487140	494100	all videos, regardless of demonetization, for metadata that violates ad-friendly guidelines.
494100	496620	That must be what they are referring to in this tweet.
496620	497620	And what do you know?
497620	500640	I dug deeper into my analytics and found this.
500640	506760	One single lone view from a source labeled YouTube Advertising, which is odd since my
506760	510000	video never had any ads running on it.
510000	515100	And it just so happens that whatever this thing is viewed my video on December 8th,
515100	518680	the same time that my video performance started to suffer.
518680	523280	I don't exactly know what I've uncovered here, but one thing's for sure, there's
523280	527520	a bunch of stuff going on behind the scenes that YouTube's not telling us.
527680	533800	And this system that YouTube has implemented runs far deeper than just demonetization.
533800	536200	I understand where YouTube is coming from here.
536200	540880	They're ultimately a business, and they're technically allowed to patrol whatever content
540880	542200	they want on their site.
542200	546960	They already block videos that violate copyright or their terms of service, and they have done
546960	547960	so for years.
547960	553640	However, YouTube's new form of censorship extends far beyond legal safekeeping.
553640	559300	This new censorship treads on what users can and cannot openly say on the platform.
559300	561280	This is about YouTube's image.
561280	564460	This is about limiting speech that they disagree with.
564460	568560	And even though the majority of people would likely agree that the speech they chose to
568560	573440	censor is reprehensible, it raises several important questions.
573440	577940	Is it ethical to censor discussion in the name of reducing obscenity?
577940	582040	Is it fair to limit the performance of controversial videos?
582040	586820	And finally, is this setting a dangerous precedent for the future of content creation
586820	588320	on YouTube?
588320	592700	These are the issues we must seriously discuss moving forward.
592700	598800	But for now, let's just sit back and enjoy the holidays, as all the giant ruthless corporations
598800	604400	in our lives get the gift of having even more power over the pathetic masses.
612040	626840	Well I'll be, I'll be so blue, I'll stake it all over the view.
626840	638520	Decoration's over, all I'll dream Christmas dreams.
638520	644360	I'll be the same thing if you're not here with me.
