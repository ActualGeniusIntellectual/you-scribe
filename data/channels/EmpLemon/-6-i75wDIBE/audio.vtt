00:00.000 --> 00:14.400
They say you should never judge a book by its cover, but I say you should absolutely judge a YouTuber by their thumbnail design.

00:14.400 --> 00:22.400
Lately, I've been spending a lot more time planning and designing my thumbnails, and I've really tried to ask myself what makes a good thumbnail on YouTube.

00:22.400 --> 00:27.360
This question has always intrigued me because thumbnails are extremely important in theory.

00:27.360 --> 00:32.000
They are the first thing anyone sees before they even think about clicking on your video.

00:32.000 --> 00:34.480
They act as a gateway to your world.

00:34.480 --> 00:40.880
Your first and sometimes only means of enticing total strangers to spare a moment of their time to watch you.

00:40.880 --> 00:47.440
However, despite their theoretical importance, thumbnails are one of the least explored elements of YouTube production in my opinion.

00:47.440 --> 00:50.960
Mostly because it's really difficult to truly appraise their worth.

00:50.960 --> 00:55.920
If you get a million view video, how much of that was directly because of the thumbnail?

00:55.920 --> 01:00.640
This ambiguity is what causes many YouTubers to treat thumbnails like an afterthought.

01:00.640 --> 01:07.840
Usually by the time you have to pick a thumbnail, you've already spent ages writing, recording, and editing the video and you're exhausted.

01:07.840 --> 01:14.000
You just want the video to be done and uploaded so you slap some bold text on a neat looking frame and call it a day.

01:14.000 --> 01:19.360
Unfortunately, this line of thinking results in most thumbnails looking generic and unremarkable.

01:19.360 --> 01:23.520
But occasionally you'll stumble across one that distinctly captures your attention.

01:23.600 --> 01:26.640
The effect that every YouTuber should strive to achieve.

01:26.640 --> 01:30.800
So what aspects about a thumbnail separate the memorable from the mundane?

01:30.800 --> 01:39.680
I asked my fans on Twitter and it turns out that the most memorable and iconic thumbnails come, unsurprisingly, from the most memorable and iconic videos.

01:39.680 --> 01:44.960
Or from thumbnails so outrageous in design that they overshadow the video itself.

01:44.960 --> 01:49.120
Ultimately these kinds of thumbnails were remembered as a matter of circumstance.

01:49.120 --> 01:52.080
But how do you determine a thumbnail's implicit value?

01:52.080 --> 01:57.280
Moreover, what are the underlying design aspects that contribute to an inherently memorable thumbnail?

02:03.040 --> 02:08.960
Well, first of all, before anyone can even take your thumbnail seriously, you have to at least make it visually clear.

02:08.960 --> 02:15.520
If graphic design is not your passion, you can at least follow these two main principles to make your stuff look halfway decent.

02:15.520 --> 02:17.680
First is the figure-ground principle.

02:17.680 --> 02:21.360
The audience should immediately be able to tell what to focus on in the frame.

02:21.440 --> 02:26.000
You have to compose the image so that the objects are clearly distinct from the background.

02:26.000 --> 02:31.280
You can achieve this by adjusting the color, contrast, size, and focus of the visual elements.

02:31.280 --> 02:34.160
The second principle you need to know is the rule of thirds.

02:34.160 --> 02:38.080
It's a very simple and effective guideline for placing objects in a frame.

02:38.080 --> 02:43.040
Aligning your focal points along the thirds will immediately make your thumbnail more visually appealing.

02:43.040 --> 02:47.680
There are many other basic visual design techniques that I would recommend researching on your own.

02:47.680 --> 02:50.800
But these are the two most important for YouTube thumbnails.

02:50.800 --> 02:57.120
Okay, so you understand basic thumbnail design on a technical level, but how can you improve them on a rhetorical level?

02:57.120 --> 03:05.360
To answer this, I tried to seek inspiration from other genres, starting with album covers, which for decades filled the same role that YouTube thumbnails do today.

03:05.360 --> 03:13.040
Across more than a half century of popular music, a few album covers have stood the test of time as absolute icons of our culture.

03:13.040 --> 03:15.120
So what made these covers so memorable?

03:15.120 --> 03:19.280
Well, they all manage to condense great meaning into a singular striking image.

03:19.280 --> 03:22.560
They are effective in both their symbolism and their simplicity.

03:22.560 --> 03:25.760
The same can be said for the most iconic movie posters.

03:25.760 --> 03:34.240
These designs are so iconic because they effectively accomplish the objective of any thumbnail design to represent the overall work using a single icon.

03:34.240 --> 03:40.320
Visual symbolism is probably the most important factor in creating thumbnails, movie posters, and album covers.

03:40.320 --> 03:48.960
And even though all three of these media types share many of the same strategies for success, they have one major difference in the amount of real estate they have to work with.

03:49.040 --> 03:55.920
Not only do YouTube thumbnails occupy a much smaller space, they're slotted against a much higher volume of competition.

03:55.920 --> 04:06.320
Whereas movie posters usually only have to stand out from a dozen or so competitors, YouTube thumbnails exist among an ocean of similar content, all competing for the same sets of eyeballs.

04:06.320 --> 04:10.720
For this reason, designing YouTube thumbnails may be the most difficult job of its kind.

04:10.720 --> 04:19.520
Because not only do you have to persuade the audience to choose you over the rest of the pack, you have to do so within a space that's often less than half the size of a business card.

04:19.520 --> 04:26.720
Because of these limitations, YouTube thumbnails don't have the liberty to compose intricate detailed designs with sneaky hidden easter eggs.

04:26.720 --> 04:28.720
There simply isn't enough room.

04:28.720 --> 04:37.040
And on YouTube, it's very interesting to see this challenging graphic design problem tackled by people who don't even know how to caption a meme in Microsoft Paint.

04:37.040 --> 04:41.600
As we've seen earlier, this can often lead to some unique results.

04:41.600 --> 04:51.920
But as much as we ridicule these examples, in my opinion they add to the rustic DIY charm of YouTube, a site where random amateurs can still succeed in spite of their technical shortcomings.

04:51.920 --> 04:58.080
YouTubers are inherently scrappy. They aren't traditional boring name-brand products like AirPods.

04:58.080 --> 05:01.760
They're hungry, emerging contenders with so much to prove, like Raycon.

05:07.040 --> 05:11.840
Oh boy, would you look at that. Due to the prevailing circumstances.

05:11.840 --> 05:18.800
The world economy is on a downward spiral. Everyone's losing money. Nobody knows if they can even afford next month's rent.

05:18.800 --> 05:25.280
Well, based on my humble experience as a YouTuber, all I can say is, make yourself comfortable.

05:25.280 --> 05:32.240
And you can make yourself comfortable with Raycon, now starting at just half the price of other premium wireless earbud brands.

05:32.240 --> 05:42.320
As companies slash marketing budgets and ad revenue plummet site-wide, Raycon is still out here picking up the slack and helping YouTubers put out content at a time when it's needed more than ever.

05:42.320 --> 05:51.360
So the next time you're in the market for wireless earbuds, ditch the AirPods, along with the clown makeup, and pick up a pair of Raycon Everyday E25s.

05:51.360 --> 05:58.480
Featuring six hours of battery life, enhanced bass, seamless Bluetooth pairing, and a sleek, compact, noise-isolating design.

05:58.480 --> 06:06.320
Raycon is perfect for listening to music, podcasts, or a one-hour loop of the downward spiral, while you're creating the next iconic YouTube thumbnail.

06:06.320 --> 06:09.280

06:18.480 --> 06:25.280
In the early days of YouTube, there were no custom thumbnails. The site would just let you pick from three random frames in your video,

06:25.280 --> 06:28.480
and you had to hope and pray that one of them looked halfway decent.

06:28.480 --> 06:32.720
This led to pretty hilarious examples of clickbait in the pre-thumbnail age,

06:32.720 --> 06:38.480
where gimmick channels who wanted to snatch some cheap views literally had to make the thumbnail into the video itself.

06:38.480 --> 06:42.960
Around the turn of the decade, YouTube enabled custom thumbnails for partner channels,

06:42.960 --> 06:47.360
who at the time only represented the very tippy-top of creators on the site.

06:47.360 --> 06:51.120
Naturally, when given the tools to make the first custom thumbnails on YouTube,

06:51.120 --> 06:54.800
these channels tried to create the opposite of the default experience.

06:54.800 --> 06:59.360
With channels like Ray William Johnson, you can witness an evolution of thumbnail strategy.

06:59.360 --> 07:02.080
At first, you see them apply the bait-and-switch tactic,

07:02.080 --> 07:05.920
which is basically what those proto-clickbait channels were trying to do anyway,

07:05.920 --> 07:08.640
only this time they could actually perform the switch.

07:08.640 --> 07:14.720
Eventually, when audiences learned to no longer trust videos where the thumbnail looked like it was ripped straight from Google Images,

07:14.720 --> 07:17.200
channels began to pivot to a new strategy.

07:17.200 --> 07:22.800
As the first generation of YouTube stars were born, they shifted themselves to the center of attention.

07:22.800 --> 07:25.760
And with that came the first attempts at thumbnail branding.

07:25.760 --> 07:30.720
This brought about the rise of eccentric facial expressions on a bright, saturated color background.

07:30.720 --> 07:34.080
It's a design that served as a blueprint for the decades to follow,

07:34.080 --> 07:39.360
and it's probably what most people think of when they imagine what a prototypical YouTube thumbnail looks like.

07:39.360 --> 07:45.600
For the first time ever, YouTubers had to think about how not to just gain viewers, but to retain viewers.

07:45.600 --> 07:48.960
Convincing people to click on one of your videos is the easy part.

07:48.960 --> 07:52.320
Convincing them to click on the next one is a lot more challenging.

07:52.320 --> 07:56.800
This concept forced creators to think more long-term about their thumbnail design.

07:56.800 --> 08:03.440
Around 2013, branding thumbnails became an even more important tactic when YouTube released the feature for everyone.

08:03.440 --> 08:10.240
I always remember when it happened because I immediately dropped everything to create my first ever custom thumbnail on my latest video.

08:10.240 --> 08:12.800
That video, of course, was The Uncredibles.

08:12.800 --> 08:18.880
And after changing the thumbnail, the video exploded in popularity, becoming the most viewed video on my channel.

08:18.880 --> 08:23.600
So it's quite possible that the only reason I'm here today is because of this one thumbnail.

08:23.600 --> 08:28.000
Oh, by the way, I just wanted to add here that there's a theory going around the YouTube community

08:28.000 --> 08:32.800
that changing your thumbnails on existing videos can help boost performance in the algorithm.

08:32.800 --> 08:38.960
I've never tried this personally, so if anyone has any evidence of this actually working, I'd be really interested to hear about it.

08:38.960 --> 08:44.000
For years, the biggest channels could coast off the exclusivity of the custom thumbnail feature,

08:44.000 --> 08:47.760
which helped serve as a great divider between the haves and the have-nots.

08:47.760 --> 08:52.080
Now that everyone had access to the feature, YouTube had leveled the playing field,

08:52.080 --> 08:55.600
and the thumbnail metagame was about to get a lot more advanced.

08:55.600 --> 08:59.520
Once the floodgates opened, channels had to make their branding much more specific.

08:59.520 --> 09:04.560
Soon enough, they would find that certain fonts, colors, and templates were becoming totally redundant,

09:04.560 --> 09:09.360
and YouTubers were forced to consider alternative branding strategies to remain unique.

09:09.360 --> 09:14.880
At this point, you saw channels turn to custom logos, character avatars, and irregular text design.

09:14.880 --> 09:17.760
You can include each of these elements to improve your branding,

09:17.760 --> 09:21.600
but in doing so, you run the risk of devaluing the overall design.

09:21.600 --> 09:26.720
For example, it's very common for YouTubers to use their face as part of their thumbnail branding,

09:26.720 --> 09:31.760
and in theory, it makes a ton of sense, given that your face is a naturally unique identifier.

09:31.760 --> 09:39.040
Our eyes are naturally drawn to faces and have evolved to perceive very subtle differences in facial structure as a means of recognizing people.

09:39.040 --> 09:42.000
So how is this a bad thing for thumbnail design?

09:42.000 --> 09:46.320
Well, facial recognition only really works if you already recognize someone.

09:46.320 --> 09:50.240
This strategy works for the huge channels that everyone already knows,

09:50.240 --> 09:54.240
but for smaller channels, well, your face is totally meaningless.

09:54.240 --> 09:58.480
This is the reason why blockbuster movie posters tend to show off the name-brand actors,

09:58.480 --> 10:01.520
while smaller films tend to be a lot more subtle about it.

10:01.520 --> 10:06.800
If the vast majority of the audience won't recognize you, then your face is just a waste of space,

10:06.800 --> 10:10.320
and therein lies the most challenging issue of YouTube thumbnails.

10:10.320 --> 10:14.880
To what extent are you willing to sacrifice visual design to improve your branding?

10:14.880 --> 10:21.760
Logos, faces, text, avatars, all these things take up space and detract from the actual subject matter of the video.

10:21.760 --> 10:26.560
As a creator, you want your thumbnail to pique the interest of the audience through striking design,

10:26.560 --> 10:30.800
but you also want it to visually connect to your other work through cohesive branding.

10:30.800 --> 10:34.240
So how do you balance these seemingly contrary principles?

10:34.240 --> 10:36.560
The answer is through stylization.

10:36.560 --> 10:40.480
You must learn to make your brand intrinsic to your visual composition.

10:40.480 --> 10:44.560
You have to learn how to communicate meaning without using text or logos.

10:44.560 --> 10:47.840
It's the visual design equivalent of show, don't tell.

10:47.840 --> 10:50.320
Achieving this may seem difficult at a glance,

10:50.320 --> 10:52.880
but the process can actually be made somewhat intuitive

10:52.880 --> 10:56.880
as long as you make the thumbnail stylistically consistent with the video.

10:56.880 --> 11:02.480
Basically, whatever style you naturally use in your videos, you should also apply to your thumbnail design.

11:02.480 --> 11:04.800
Again, it's like poetry, sort of they rhyme.

11:04.800 --> 11:09.200
I know that it's lame to hear yet another advice video telling you to be yourself,

11:09.200 --> 11:12.080
but in this instance, it definitely bears repeating.

11:12.080 --> 11:17.760
I see some videos where it looks like the creator spent more time editing together the thumbnail than the video itself.

11:17.760 --> 11:23.360
The thumbnail acts as a tool for the audience to form baseline expectations as they head into the video.

11:23.360 --> 11:26.880
And when those expectations are not congruent with the overall product,

11:26.880 --> 11:30.480
it can often leave the audience feeling confused or dissatisfied.

11:30.480 --> 11:33.760
This applies not just to the overall production value of the video,

11:33.760 --> 11:36.400
but the pacing, direction, and tone as well.

11:36.400 --> 11:41.760
For example, Frederik Knudsen and Internet Historian both cover similar subjects of internet lore,

11:41.760 --> 11:44.240
but their tonality is completely different.

11:44.240 --> 11:46.640
Frederik's videos tend to be dry and straightforward,

11:46.640 --> 11:50.160
while Internet Historian's tend to be a lot more casual and comedic.

11:50.160 --> 11:53.280
But you don't have to watch any of their videos to figure this out.

11:53.280 --> 11:57.760
Both of their presentation styles could be inferred directly from their thumbnail design.

11:57.760 --> 12:03.280
And with this, you have to realize that the point of a thumbnail is not to look pretty or to clickbait the audience.

12:03.280 --> 12:08.640
The point of a thumbnail is to serve as a succinct representation of the video and its creator.

12:08.640 --> 12:13.920
The thumbnail should telegraph to the audience exactly what to expect when entering your world.

12:13.920 --> 12:20.240
Ideally, the audience should be able to tell exactly whose video they're clicking on by looking at the thumbnail alone.

12:20.240 --> 12:23.840
As long as you achieve this, the thumbnail has done its job.

12:23.840 --> 12:32.560
But with that being said, don't let these guidelines serve as restrictions on what you're allowed to create.

12:32.560 --> 12:35.040
YouTube is a playground of experimentation.

12:35.040 --> 12:38.080
You can get away with more here than you can anywhere else.

12:38.080 --> 12:42.720
You know, as much as we laugh at the more absurd thumbnail designs, maybe they're onto something.

12:42.720 --> 12:49.520
As with most things on YouTube, one of the best strategies in the meta is, counterintuitively, to be anti-meta.

12:49.520 --> 12:54.960
As long as your thumbnails make people think of you, well, the end justifies the means.

12:54.960 --> 12:57.840
Whatever route you take to get there is your own choice.

12:57.840 --> 13:02.800
The strategies of the future will be first introduced by the radical experimentation of today.

13:02.800 --> 13:05.760
And I'm interested to see where the meta is going to go from here.

13:05.760 --> 13:09.120
One technique I'd like to see explored more is negative space.

13:09.120 --> 13:13.840
Rebel Taxi has always used this design method to give his thumbnails a very unique look.

13:13.840 --> 13:19.200
Basically, if you match the outline of your thumbnail to the same color as the default YouTube background,

13:19.200 --> 13:22.880
you could theoretically customize the shape of the thumbnail itself.

13:22.880 --> 13:27.040
I'd also be interested in seeing how people play around with information flow.

13:27.040 --> 13:32.800
Lately, I've been seeing a trend of creators using the thumbnail to raise a question that is answered by the subsequent video.

13:32.800 --> 13:38.080
This technique seems to play on the audience's curiosity and dares them to fill in the conceptual blanks.

13:38.080 --> 13:42.080
Perhaps the most iconic example of this is Vsauce's newer videos.

13:42.080 --> 13:45.920
His thumbnails first come off making absolutely no sense whatsoever.

13:45.920 --> 13:48.000
And then, after watching the video, you're like,

13:48.000 --> 13:49.680
Oh, so that's what it means.

13:49.680 --> 13:52.800
It's a really unique effect that I don't think he gets enough credit for.

13:54.480 --> 13:54.980
Thank you.

13:59.760 --> 14:04.880
Anyway, I just wanted to finish up this video by walking you through my process for making thumbnails,

14:04.880 --> 14:07.040
using my last video as an example.

14:07.040 --> 14:10.640
So going into this video, I didn't have a clear idea for the thumbnail.

14:10.640 --> 14:14.960
For some videos, I know exactly what the thumbnail will be before I even go to write the script.

14:14.960 --> 14:16.720
But in this case, I didn't.

14:16.720 --> 14:19.920
I did plan for the title to be Operation Red Herring.

14:19.920 --> 14:24.880
So my first idea for the thumbnail was to put the Matt Watson head icon on a fish's body.

14:24.880 --> 14:30.400
But then I thought that would be a little too on the nose and not really representative of what the video was actually about.

14:30.400 --> 14:35.360
Luckily, by the end of the video, I had tons of visual assets to brainstorm something different.

14:35.360 --> 14:41.600
I first decided to include this high contrast image of Matt, which I took from his channel banner and colored red.

14:41.600 --> 14:48.320
I felt this image perfectly represents the two sides of Matt Watson, the public persona and the digital poltergeist.

14:48.320 --> 14:53.360
For the other side of the frame, I rearranged the elements of another composition to create this design.

14:53.360 --> 14:57.520
I applied a shatter effect to the text to make it more cohesive with the broken glass,

14:57.520 --> 15:02.800
with the symbolism here being that Matt shattered the YouTube ecosystem through his militant campaign.

15:02.800 --> 15:09.440
I was somewhat satisfied with this, but I didn't like how the little YouTube wake up icon was pretty indistinguishable at thumbnail size.

15:09.440 --> 15:13.200
So I decided to replace it with a red radial gradient instead.

15:13.200 --> 15:16.880
I altered the broken glass effect a bit and ended up with this design.

15:16.880 --> 15:22.080
Unfortunately, when I scaled the image down, I thought that the text just wasn't readable enough,

15:22.080 --> 15:24.640
and that the overall frame was just too cluttered.

15:24.640 --> 15:29.360
So I decided to get rid of the text and broken glass filter, leaving just the radial pattern.

15:29.360 --> 15:32.720
Immediately, I found this version to be a lot more striking and elegant.

15:32.720 --> 15:39.120
The text wasn't that necessary, and I felt that the more mysterious design did a better job at capturing the essence of the video.

15:39.120 --> 15:44.000
The red radial pattern has a double meaning of representing the proverbial wormhole of Matt Watson,

15:44.000 --> 15:46.560
as well as the waves of outrage he created.

15:46.560 --> 15:52.080
So the fundamental design was in place, and all I had to do now was make the radial pattern a bit dirtier,

15:52.080 --> 15:56.080
to better represent the messy and inconclusive details of the mystery.

15:56.080 --> 16:00.480
After testing out a bunch of different filters, I decided on this newsprint effect.

16:00.480 --> 16:04.160
I like it so much because the closer you look into it, the fuzzier it becomes,

16:04.160 --> 16:07.840
which is exactly how I felt researching Matt Watson's story.

16:07.840 --> 16:12.240
And there we have it. Just add a red border for branding, and that's one finished thumbnail.

16:12.240 --> 16:17.760
You may be wondering if I'm overthinking all this, and if anyone really notices this attention to detail.

16:17.760 --> 16:21.920
All I can say to that is that you may not have noticed it, but your brain did.

16:37.840 --> 16:46.080
I don't get involved in violence. In Japan, they call it anime.

16:49.680 --> 16:51.760
I'm glad you came to see me, Paul.

16:51.760 --> 16:52.320
Cookie dough!
