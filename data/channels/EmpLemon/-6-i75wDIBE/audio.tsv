0	14400	They say you should never judge a book by its cover, but I say you should absolutely judge a YouTuber by their thumbnail design.
14400	22400	Lately, I've been spending a lot more time planning and designing my thumbnails, and I've really tried to ask myself what makes a good thumbnail on YouTube.
22400	27360	This question has always intrigued me because thumbnails are extremely important in theory.
27360	32000	They are the first thing anyone sees before they even think about clicking on your video.
32000	34480	They act as a gateway to your world.
34480	40880	Your first and sometimes only means of enticing total strangers to spare a moment of their time to watch you.
40880	47440	However, despite their theoretical importance, thumbnails are one of the least explored elements of YouTube production in my opinion.
47440	50960	Mostly because it's really difficult to truly appraise their worth.
50960	55920	If you get a million view video, how much of that was directly because of the thumbnail?
55920	60640	This ambiguity is what causes many YouTubers to treat thumbnails like an afterthought.
60640	67840	Usually by the time you have to pick a thumbnail, you've already spent ages writing, recording, and editing the video and you're exhausted.
67840	74000	You just want the video to be done and uploaded so you slap some bold text on a neat looking frame and call it a day.
74000	79360	Unfortunately, this line of thinking results in most thumbnails looking generic and unremarkable.
79360	83520	But occasionally you'll stumble across one that distinctly captures your attention.
83600	86640	The effect that every YouTuber should strive to achieve.
86640	90800	So what aspects about a thumbnail separate the memorable from the mundane?
90800	99680	I asked my fans on Twitter and it turns out that the most memorable and iconic thumbnails come, unsurprisingly, from the most memorable and iconic videos.
99680	104960	Or from thumbnails so outrageous in design that they overshadow the video itself.
104960	109120	Ultimately these kinds of thumbnails were remembered as a matter of circumstance.
109120	112080	But how do you determine a thumbnail's implicit value?
112080	117280	Moreover, what are the underlying design aspects that contribute to an inherently memorable thumbnail?
123040	128960	Well, first of all, before anyone can even take your thumbnail seriously, you have to at least make it visually clear.
128960	135520	If graphic design is not your passion, you can at least follow these two main principles to make your stuff look halfway decent.
135520	137680	First is the figure-ground principle.
137680	141360	The audience should immediately be able to tell what to focus on in the frame.
141440	146000	You have to compose the image so that the objects are clearly distinct from the background.
146000	151280	You can achieve this by adjusting the color, contrast, size, and focus of the visual elements.
151280	154160	The second principle you need to know is the rule of thirds.
154160	158080	It's a very simple and effective guideline for placing objects in a frame.
158080	163040	Aligning your focal points along the thirds will immediately make your thumbnail more visually appealing.
163040	167680	There are many other basic visual design techniques that I would recommend researching on your own.
167680	170800	But these are the two most important for YouTube thumbnails.
170800	177120	Okay, so you understand basic thumbnail design on a technical level, but how can you improve them on a rhetorical level?
177120	185360	To answer this, I tried to seek inspiration from other genres, starting with album covers, which for decades filled the same role that YouTube thumbnails do today.
185360	193040	Across more than a half century of popular music, a few album covers have stood the test of time as absolute icons of our culture.
193040	195120	So what made these covers so memorable?
195120	199280	Well, they all manage to condense great meaning into a singular striking image.
199280	202560	They are effective in both their symbolism and their simplicity.
202560	205760	The same can be said for the most iconic movie posters.
205760	214240	These designs are so iconic because they effectively accomplish the objective of any thumbnail design to represent the overall work using a single icon.
214240	220320	Visual symbolism is probably the most important factor in creating thumbnails, movie posters, and album covers.
220320	228960	And even though all three of these media types share many of the same strategies for success, they have one major difference in the amount of real estate they have to work with.
229040	235920	Not only do YouTube thumbnails occupy a much smaller space, they're slotted against a much higher volume of competition.
235920	246320	Whereas movie posters usually only have to stand out from a dozen or so competitors, YouTube thumbnails exist among an ocean of similar content, all competing for the same sets of eyeballs.
246320	250720	For this reason, designing YouTube thumbnails may be the most difficult job of its kind.
250720	259520	Because not only do you have to persuade the audience to choose you over the rest of the pack, you have to do so within a space that's often less than half the size of a business card.
259520	266720	Because of these limitations, YouTube thumbnails don't have the liberty to compose intricate detailed designs with sneaky hidden easter eggs.
266720	268720	There simply isn't enough room.
268720	277040	And on YouTube, it's very interesting to see this challenging graphic design problem tackled by people who don't even know how to caption a meme in Microsoft Paint.
277040	281600	As we've seen earlier, this can often lead to some unique results.
281600	291920	But as much as we ridicule these examples, in my opinion they add to the rustic DIY charm of YouTube, a site where random amateurs can still succeed in spite of their technical shortcomings.
291920	298080	YouTubers are inherently scrappy. They aren't traditional boring name-brand products like AirPods.
298080	301760	They're hungry, emerging contenders with so much to prove, like Raycon.
307040	311840	Oh boy, would you look at that. Due to the prevailing circumstances.
311840	318800	The world economy is on a downward spiral. Everyone's losing money. Nobody knows if they can even afford next month's rent.
318800	325280	Well, based on my humble experience as a YouTuber, all I can say is, make yourself comfortable.
325280	332240	And you can make yourself comfortable with Raycon, now starting at just half the price of other premium wireless earbud brands.
332240	342320	As companies slash marketing budgets and ad revenue plummet site-wide, Raycon is still out here picking up the slack and helping YouTubers put out content at a time when it's needed more than ever.
342320	351360	So the next time you're in the market for wireless earbuds, ditch the AirPods, along with the clown makeup, and pick up a pair of Raycon Everyday E25s.
351360	358480	Featuring six hours of battery life, enhanced bass, seamless Bluetooth pairing, and a sleek, compact, noise-isolating design.
358480	366320	Raycon is perfect for listening to music, podcasts, or a one-hour loop of the downward spiral, while you're creating the next iconic YouTube thumbnail.

378480	385280	In the early days of YouTube, there were no custom thumbnails. The site would just let you pick from three random frames in your video,
385280	388480	and you had to hope and pray that one of them looked halfway decent.
388480	392720	This led to pretty hilarious examples of clickbait in the pre-thumbnail age,
392720	398480	where gimmick channels who wanted to snatch some cheap views literally had to make the thumbnail into the video itself.
398480	402960	Around the turn of the decade, YouTube enabled custom thumbnails for partner channels,
402960	407360	who at the time only represented the very tippy-top of creators on the site.
407360	411120	Naturally, when given the tools to make the first custom thumbnails on YouTube,
411120	414800	these channels tried to create the opposite of the default experience.
414800	419360	With channels like Ray William Johnson, you can witness an evolution of thumbnail strategy.
419360	422080	At first, you see them apply the bait-and-switch tactic,
422080	425920	which is basically what those proto-clickbait channels were trying to do anyway,
425920	428640	only this time they could actually perform the switch.
428640	434720	Eventually, when audiences learned to no longer trust videos where the thumbnail looked like it was ripped straight from Google Images,
434720	437200	channels began to pivot to a new strategy.
437200	442800	As the first generation of YouTube stars were born, they shifted themselves to the center of attention.
442800	445760	And with that came the first attempts at thumbnail branding.
445760	450720	This brought about the rise of eccentric facial expressions on a bright, saturated color background.
450720	454080	It's a design that served as a blueprint for the decades to follow,
454080	459360	and it's probably what most people think of when they imagine what a prototypical YouTube thumbnail looks like.
459360	465600	For the first time ever, YouTubers had to think about how not to just gain viewers, but to retain viewers.
465600	468960	Convincing people to click on one of your videos is the easy part.
468960	472320	Convincing them to click on the next one is a lot more challenging.
472320	476800	This concept forced creators to think more long-term about their thumbnail design.
476800	483440	Around 2013, branding thumbnails became an even more important tactic when YouTube released the feature for everyone.
483440	490240	I always remember when it happened because I immediately dropped everything to create my first ever custom thumbnail on my latest video.
490240	492800	That video, of course, was The Uncredibles.
492800	498880	And after changing the thumbnail, the video exploded in popularity, becoming the most viewed video on my channel.
498880	503600	So it's quite possible that the only reason I'm here today is because of this one thumbnail.
503600	508000	Oh, by the way, I just wanted to add here that there's a theory going around the YouTube community
508000	512800	that changing your thumbnails on existing videos can help boost performance in the algorithm.
512800	518960	I've never tried this personally, so if anyone has any evidence of this actually working, I'd be really interested to hear about it.
518960	524000	For years, the biggest channels could coast off the exclusivity of the custom thumbnail feature,
524000	527760	which helped serve as a great divider between the haves and the have-nots.
527760	532080	Now that everyone had access to the feature, YouTube had leveled the playing field,
532080	535600	and the thumbnail metagame was about to get a lot more advanced.
535600	539520	Once the floodgates opened, channels had to make their branding much more specific.
539520	544560	Soon enough, they would find that certain fonts, colors, and templates were becoming totally redundant,
544560	549360	and YouTubers were forced to consider alternative branding strategies to remain unique.
549360	554880	At this point, you saw channels turn to custom logos, character avatars, and irregular text design.
554880	557760	You can include each of these elements to improve your branding,
557760	561600	but in doing so, you run the risk of devaluing the overall design.
561600	566720	For example, it's very common for YouTubers to use their face as part of their thumbnail branding,
566720	571760	and in theory, it makes a ton of sense, given that your face is a naturally unique identifier.
571760	579040	Our eyes are naturally drawn to faces and have evolved to perceive very subtle differences in facial structure as a means of recognizing people.
579040	582000	So how is this a bad thing for thumbnail design?
582000	586320	Well, facial recognition only really works if you already recognize someone.
586320	590240	This strategy works for the huge channels that everyone already knows,
590240	594240	but for smaller channels, well, your face is totally meaningless.
594240	598480	This is the reason why blockbuster movie posters tend to show off the name-brand actors,
598480	601520	while smaller films tend to be a lot more subtle about it.
601520	606800	If the vast majority of the audience won't recognize you, then your face is just a waste of space,
606800	610320	and therein lies the most challenging issue of YouTube thumbnails.
610320	614880	To what extent are you willing to sacrifice visual design to improve your branding?
614880	621760	Logos, faces, text, avatars, all these things take up space and detract from the actual subject matter of the video.
621760	626560	As a creator, you want your thumbnail to pique the interest of the audience through striking design,
626560	630800	but you also want it to visually connect to your other work through cohesive branding.
630800	634240	So how do you balance these seemingly contrary principles?
634240	636560	The answer is through stylization.
636560	640480	You must learn to make your brand intrinsic to your visual composition.
640480	644560	You have to learn how to communicate meaning without using text or logos.
644560	647840	It's the visual design equivalent of show, don't tell.
647840	650320	Achieving this may seem difficult at a glance,
650320	652880	but the process can actually be made somewhat intuitive
652880	656880	as long as you make the thumbnail stylistically consistent with the video.
656880	662480	Basically, whatever style you naturally use in your videos, you should also apply to your thumbnail design.
662480	664800	Again, it's like poetry, sort of they rhyme.
664800	669200	I know that it's lame to hear yet another advice video telling you to be yourself,
669200	672080	but in this instance, it definitely bears repeating.
672080	677760	I see some videos where it looks like the creator spent more time editing together the thumbnail than the video itself.
677760	683360	The thumbnail acts as a tool for the audience to form baseline expectations as they head into the video.
683360	686880	And when those expectations are not congruent with the overall product,
686880	690480	it can often leave the audience feeling confused or dissatisfied.
690480	693760	This applies not just to the overall production value of the video,
693760	696400	but the pacing, direction, and tone as well.
696400	701760	For example, Frederik Knudsen and Internet Historian both cover similar subjects of internet lore,
701760	704240	but their tonality is completely different.
704240	706640	Frederik's videos tend to be dry and straightforward,
706640	710160	while Internet Historian's tend to be a lot more casual and comedic.
710160	713280	But you don't have to watch any of their videos to figure this out.
713280	717760	Both of their presentation styles could be inferred directly from their thumbnail design.
717760	723280	And with this, you have to realize that the point of a thumbnail is not to look pretty or to clickbait the audience.
723280	728640	The point of a thumbnail is to serve as a succinct representation of the video and its creator.
728640	733920	The thumbnail should telegraph to the audience exactly what to expect when entering your world.
733920	740240	Ideally, the audience should be able to tell exactly whose video they're clicking on by looking at the thumbnail alone.
740240	743840	As long as you achieve this, the thumbnail has done its job.
743840	752560	But with that being said, don't let these guidelines serve as restrictions on what you're allowed to create.
752560	755040	YouTube is a playground of experimentation.
755040	758080	You can get away with more here than you can anywhere else.
758080	762720	You know, as much as we laugh at the more absurd thumbnail designs, maybe they're onto something.
762720	769520	As with most things on YouTube, one of the best strategies in the meta is, counterintuitively, to be anti-meta.
769520	774960	As long as your thumbnails make people think of you, well, the end justifies the means.
774960	777840	Whatever route you take to get there is your own choice.
777840	782800	The strategies of the future will be first introduced by the radical experimentation of today.
782800	785760	And I'm interested to see where the meta is going to go from here.
785760	789120	One technique I'd like to see explored more is negative space.
789120	793840	Rebel Taxi has always used this design method to give his thumbnails a very unique look.
793840	799200	Basically, if you match the outline of your thumbnail to the same color as the default YouTube background,
799200	802880	you could theoretically customize the shape of the thumbnail itself.
802880	807040	I'd also be interested in seeing how people play around with information flow.
807040	812800	Lately, I've been seeing a trend of creators using the thumbnail to raise a question that is answered by the subsequent video.
812800	818080	This technique seems to play on the audience's curiosity and dares them to fill in the conceptual blanks.
818080	822080	Perhaps the most iconic example of this is Vsauce's newer videos.
822080	825920	His thumbnails first come off making absolutely no sense whatsoever.
825920	828000	And then, after watching the video, you're like,
828000	829680	Oh, so that's what it means.
829680	832800	It's a really unique effect that I don't think he gets enough credit for.
834480	834980	Thank you.
839760	844880	Anyway, I just wanted to finish up this video by walking you through my process for making thumbnails,
844880	847040	using my last video as an example.
847040	850640	So going into this video, I didn't have a clear idea for the thumbnail.
850640	854960	For some videos, I know exactly what the thumbnail will be before I even go to write the script.
854960	856720	But in this case, I didn't.
856720	859920	I did plan for the title to be Operation Red Herring.
859920	864880	So my first idea for the thumbnail was to put the Matt Watson head icon on a fish's body.
864880	870400	But then I thought that would be a little too on the nose and not really representative of what the video was actually about.
870400	875360	Luckily, by the end of the video, I had tons of visual assets to brainstorm something different.
875360	881600	I first decided to include this high contrast image of Matt, which I took from his channel banner and colored red.
881600	888320	I felt this image perfectly represents the two sides of Matt Watson, the public persona and the digital poltergeist.
888320	893360	For the other side of the frame, I rearranged the elements of another composition to create this design.
893360	897520	I applied a shatter effect to the text to make it more cohesive with the broken glass,
897520	902800	with the symbolism here being that Matt shattered the YouTube ecosystem through his militant campaign.
902800	909440	I was somewhat satisfied with this, but I didn't like how the little YouTube wake up icon was pretty indistinguishable at thumbnail size.
909440	913200	So I decided to replace it with a red radial gradient instead.
913200	916880	I altered the broken glass effect a bit and ended up with this design.
916880	922080	Unfortunately, when I scaled the image down, I thought that the text just wasn't readable enough,
922080	924640	and that the overall frame was just too cluttered.
924640	929360	So I decided to get rid of the text and broken glass filter, leaving just the radial pattern.
929360	932720	Immediately, I found this version to be a lot more striking and elegant.
932720	939120	The text wasn't that necessary, and I felt that the more mysterious design did a better job at capturing the essence of the video.
939120	944000	The red radial pattern has a double meaning of representing the proverbial wormhole of Matt Watson,
944000	946560	as well as the waves of outrage he created.
946560	952080	So the fundamental design was in place, and all I had to do now was make the radial pattern a bit dirtier,
952080	956080	to better represent the messy and inconclusive details of the mystery.
956080	960480	After testing out a bunch of different filters, I decided on this newsprint effect.
960480	964160	I like it so much because the closer you look into it, the fuzzier it becomes,
964160	967840	which is exactly how I felt researching Matt Watson's story.
967840	972240	And there we have it. Just add a red border for branding, and that's one finished thumbnail.
972240	977760	You may be wondering if I'm overthinking all this, and if anyone really notices this attention to detail.
977760	981920	All I can say to that is that you may not have noticed it, but your brain did.
997840	1006080	I don't get involved in violence. In Japan, they call it anime.
1009680	1011760	I'm glad you came to see me, Paul.
1011760	1012320	Cookie dough!
