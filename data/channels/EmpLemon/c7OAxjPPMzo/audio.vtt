00:00.000 --> 00:05.760
There's four hundred and four days of summer vacation, and then school comes along just to fall

00:07.760 --> 00:11.280
Oh boy, would you look at that? Summer is over already.

00:11.280 --> 00:14.880
Seems like just yesterday that I was rolling into June on the meme express.

00:16.640 --> 00:19.520
Anyway, I've started college. Super hyped for that.

00:19.520 --> 00:24.640
But this video is about something that happened to me about this time last year.

00:24.640 --> 00:28.800
I'm talking about when I entered senior year of high school.

00:28.800 --> 00:34.640
Now, I should preface this by saying that I really, really, really try not to be an edgy person.

00:34.640 --> 00:39.840
I actually try to enjoy life, I try to have a positive attitude whenever I can,

00:39.840 --> 00:43.360
and I don't like to complain about my situation and disposition

00:43.360 --> 00:47.120
unless I've experienced something completely infuriating.

00:47.120 --> 00:49.040
This is one of those cases.

00:49.040 --> 00:54.960
Out of everything, if I had to choose one topic about my life to complain about, this would be it.

00:54.960 --> 00:56.480
Because if you ask me the question,

00:56.480 --> 01:01.120
Hey M, what's the angriest you've ever been in your entire life?

01:01.120 --> 01:03.440
This story is about that point.

01:03.440 --> 01:05.920
Like I said earlier, I'm not usually in a bad mood.

01:06.560 --> 01:09.360
I can probably count on two hands the number of times per year

01:09.360 --> 01:12.400
when I'm legitimately pissed off for more than a few hours at a time.

01:12.960 --> 01:16.320
I just tend to get over stuff really easily and move on.

01:16.320 --> 01:21.760
However, the reason this story is so significant is because I was pissed off not for a few hours,

01:21.760 --> 01:27.440
not for a few days, but legitimately for an entire month, from August through September of last year.

01:28.240 --> 01:31.600
Ladies and gentlemen, this is the story of the series of events

01:31.600 --> 01:34.880
which led me to the angriest stage of my entire life.

01:37.520 --> 01:41.520
Our story begins the first fucking day of senior year.

01:41.520 --> 01:43.440
Well, actually it starts even before that.

01:43.440 --> 01:47.440
You see, I went to public school in the same school district since the fourth grade,

01:47.440 --> 01:52.000
and every single year the school would begin sometime around August 20th.

01:52.000 --> 01:57.280
Yet despite this, the school board inexplicably decided to move the start date of school

01:57.280 --> 01:59.760
to August 10th for my final year.

01:59.760 --> 02:02.000
Lame lame lame lame lame!

02:02.000 --> 02:06.800
So I effectively got robbed of an entire week of my final summer vacation.

02:06.800 --> 02:08.640
This didn't really bother me too much,

02:08.640 --> 02:13.440
but during the first week I was slightly annoyed that I was stuck in school on dates,

02:13.440 --> 02:16.320
which for the previous decade was still summer vacation.

02:16.320 --> 02:18.640
But in all honesty, I wasn't too disappointed.

02:18.640 --> 02:20.880
It was just one inconvenience after all.

02:24.800 --> 02:26.240
Also starting in senior year,

02:26.240 --> 02:30.160
the school library suddenly became a slight bit incompetent.

02:32.000 --> 02:34.080
In all three previous years at my high school,

02:34.080 --> 02:38.160
it never took me more than two separate trips to the library

02:38.160 --> 02:40.800
before I got all of my textbooks for my classes.

02:40.800 --> 02:45.200
In senior year, it took me at least four Chicken McNuggets.

02:45.280 --> 02:46.400
I may have lost count.

02:46.400 --> 02:48.400
First the system was down, then the books were missing,

02:48.400 --> 02:52.720
then a bunch of logistical problems that I'd never experienced before at this school.

02:52.720 --> 02:55.280
At this point I was still just slightly annoyed,

02:55.280 --> 02:56.160
but I carried on.

02:59.680 --> 03:02.560
At the beginning of every school year, I like to buy a planner.

03:03.200 --> 03:06.800
A little notebook for writing assignments and test dates.

03:06.800 --> 03:11.840
I relied on it to remember the dozens of assignments I had on a weekly basis,

03:11.840 --> 03:15.680
so I walk over to the front office on day two of school,

03:15.680 --> 03:18.480
and they tell me that they're sold out of planners.

03:18.480 --> 03:20.160
On day fucking two.

03:20.160 --> 03:24.960
Keep in mind that in the 11 previous years of school which I've experienced,

03:24.960 --> 03:29.920
whichever school I was in never ran out of planners until at least October,

03:29.920 --> 03:32.160
much less the second fucking day.

03:32.160 --> 03:37.440
I later learned that the bulk of the planners were sold at the freshman orientation,

03:37.520 --> 03:41.920
but that doesn't really excuse the school for running out of planners on the second day.

03:41.920 --> 03:44.400
It just shows a complete lack of planning on their part.

03:44.400 --> 03:47.520
Now at this point I was becoming fairly frustrated

03:47.520 --> 03:52.960
that there were already three separate upsetting incidents by day two of senior year,

03:52.960 --> 03:55.520
but oh boy, that was just the beginning.

03:59.120 --> 04:03.200
Here's where the story starts getting good, and by that I mean bad, very bad.

04:03.200 --> 04:05.040
So I need a locker.

04:05.040 --> 04:08.640
I'm taking advanced classes, and I have a lot of books and binders,

04:09.440 --> 04:12.240
and I need a place to put my stuff, so get this.

04:14.000 --> 04:23.280
High school thought it would be a good idea to let fresh men pick their lockers first,

04:24.000 --> 04:27.200
then sophomores, then juniors and seniors.

04:27.200 --> 04:31.520
Why freshmen were given the priority over seniors yet again, I'll never know.

04:31.520 --> 04:33.040
It should also be noted that over the summer,

04:33.040 --> 04:36.960
the county had changed the zoning laws over high school attendance,

04:36.960 --> 04:41.840
so this year there were about 200 more freshmen than there were in the previous year.

04:41.840 --> 04:46.400
This is important, because by the time I got to pick my locker,

04:46.400 --> 04:48.880
nearly all of the lockers were taken.

04:48.880 --> 04:54.320
There was only one group of lockers in the middle of all my classes with vacancies still available.

04:54.320 --> 04:56.000
If I picked a locker anywhere else,

04:56.000 --> 05:00.320
I would risk being late for at least one of my classes throughout the day.

05:00.320 --> 05:03.760
So I scout out the lockers over there, and boy, it's slim pickings.

05:03.760 --> 05:06.720
I did spot one that was available that I could tolerate,

05:06.720 --> 05:11.600
so I go to rent it, but the clerk says that somebody already owned it.

05:11.600 --> 05:13.040
For those of you who don't know,

05:13.040 --> 05:18.080
it's a pretty common practice to turn locks upside down if the locker is vacant,

05:18.080 --> 05:20.000
and right side up if it's in use.

05:20.000 --> 05:23.840
The locker I saw had a lock which was upside down,

05:23.840 --> 05:26.080
but apparently somebody had already rented it.

05:26.080 --> 05:29.280
So at this point, lunch is almost over, and I need to get the class soon,

05:29.280 --> 05:30.560
so I just say fuck it.

05:30.560 --> 05:34.160
I ask the clerk, can you just give me any locker in this area that's vacant?

05:34.720 --> 05:37.680
Ooh, looks like this one's available.

05:37.680 --> 05:43.680
Let's just say that there was a reason that this locker was available,

05:43.680 --> 05:46.080
because the locker I got was

05:46.080 --> 05:48.320
DAVEY JONES LOCKER!

05:48.320 --> 05:49.600
DISGUSTING!

05:49.600 --> 05:52.160
It was a bottom locker in a corner,

05:52.160 --> 05:57.840
and I knew the roof leaked over it because the ground underneath was covered with black stuff,

05:57.840 --> 06:00.880
as opposed to the gray concrete typical the school.

06:00.880 --> 06:04.160
I think it was a combination of dirt, mold, and rat feces,

06:04.160 --> 06:06.720
and every time it rained, water would fall from the ceiling

06:06.720 --> 06:09.760
and splatter the black stuff all over my locker door.

06:09.760 --> 06:15.040
I felt like each day I would get hepatitis, AIDS, or some undiscovered disease

06:15.040 --> 06:20.320
because I'm certain that the forces of evolution were hard at work in that black stuff.

06:20.320 --> 06:25.040
The lock itself was nearly rusted shut from the water exposure, and it barely worked.

06:25.680 --> 06:27.840
It took me so long fiddling with the combination

06:27.840 --> 06:31.600
that I just had to leave it unlocked at all times to avoid being late for class.

06:31.600 --> 06:34.640
One day there was an exceptionally heavy rainstorm,

06:34.640 --> 06:40.400
which kicked up enough water that one of the books inside of my locker actually got waterlogged.

06:40.400 --> 06:44.640
So what we had here was a locker that couldn't lock and couldn't provide shelter,

06:45.440 --> 06:48.880
and I paid five dollars for the privilege to use this thing.

06:48.880 --> 06:53.440
After that textbook got soiled,

06:53.440 --> 06:56.800
I just gave up and started stowing my books in the backseat of my car.

06:56.800 --> 07:00.640
I called it the La Car. Get it? Haha, I'm so clever and funny.

07:00.640 --> 07:02.480
Oh boy, and speaking of my car...

07:05.200 --> 07:09.120
Funny thing is I actually made a video about this on my alt about a year ago,

07:09.120 --> 07:12.160
the day that it happened, and you can look it up, it's still there.

07:12.800 --> 07:17.040
But if you don't want to watch it, long story short, I'm a tryhard at school.

07:17.600 --> 07:19.040
I like getting good grades.

07:19.040 --> 07:24.320
I got my GPA high enough that by senior year I qualified for honor student parking,

07:24.320 --> 07:28.160
which was much nicer than the shithole that was the general student's parking.

07:28.160 --> 07:29.920
HOLY SHIT

07:29.920 --> 07:33.360
It was closer to the school, and you could leave as soon as school ended.

07:33.360 --> 07:39.040
It's just a little carrot for the kids who have endured the miles upon miles of stick

07:39.040 --> 07:41.600
required to get to the top five percent of the class.

07:41.600 --> 07:44.400
Now before I talk about what happens next, all of you need to know

07:45.120 --> 07:49.040
that the events which I've already described in this video

07:49.600 --> 07:54.400
have been happening one after the other, and for the first two weeks of school,

07:54.400 --> 08:00.400
my frustration has been building and building to the point where I'm almost at my breaking point.

08:00.400 --> 08:04.080
I like to think about a concept of what I call nuclear rage.

08:04.640 --> 08:10.080
It's a level of anger which is just a cut above any period of common rage.

08:10.080 --> 08:14.240
It's a stage where you just lose control of your cognitive abilities,

08:14.240 --> 08:16.960
and you just become a faucet of fury.

08:16.960 --> 08:21.120
You're not yourself anymore, you just become a primal beast of aggression,

08:21.120 --> 08:27.440
and the anger takes full control of your body, and you completely fucking melt down.

08:27.440 --> 08:30.080
It's like going Super Saiyan, but for anger.

08:30.640 --> 08:34.480
I've only reached this level of rage a few times in my entire life,

08:35.040 --> 08:40.320
and last year in 2015 my high school pushed me to this level,

08:40.320 --> 08:45.280
because on one afternoon I returned to my car in the parking lot and see that it's been blocked!

08:48.480 --> 08:54.000
No seriously, my school built a wall of fucking automobiles to keep me in school.

08:54.640 --> 08:56.480
What the fuck is this?

08:56.480 --> 09:01.840
I should explain here that my high school has always had a traffic problem.

09:04.480 --> 09:15.040
But rather than actually tackling the root of the problem and redesigning the shitty roads,

09:15.040 --> 09:19.040
they just decided to hot fix everything by cutting as many corners as possible.

09:19.040 --> 09:24.320
So the school sacrificed the honors parking lot to the traffic gods by funneling all of

09:24.320 --> 09:28.960
the parent pickup traffic through the honors parking lot so that you cannot physically

09:28.960 --> 09:32.400
pull out of your parking spot unless the traffic allowed you.

09:32.400 --> 09:34.480
I went to talk to the principal after seeing this,

09:35.280 --> 09:40.720
and he unapologetically informed me that this was a permanent traffic change.

09:42.080 --> 09:44.720
TACTICAL NUKE, INCOMING!

09:53.600 --> 09:58.720
This is the final straw.

10:02.400 --> 10:12.320
It was at this point when I completely lost all respect and faith in my high school,

10:12.320 --> 10:14.960
and I'd actually liked my high school up until this time.

10:14.960 --> 10:20.320
It was at this point when senior year was completely soiled beyond any scrap of repair.

10:20.320 --> 10:23.280
It took my school two and a half fucking weeks.

10:23.280 --> 10:28.960
That parking spot was the one final solitary thing that I was clinging to to tell myself,

10:28.960 --> 10:33.360
well at least I have this, and my school had to fuck that up for me too.

10:33.360 --> 10:37.600
I don't want to come off as entitled by saying this whole spiel because

10:37.600 --> 10:42.400
I could honestly care less about having a functional locker and a good parking spot,

10:42.400 --> 10:49.440
but when I am being blatantly treated worse than every other student in this school

10:50.160 --> 10:55.440
for basically no reason, being denied basic school services that were available

10:55.440 --> 10:59.840
to the last 10 grades before me, that's where I draw the fucking line.

10:59.840 --> 11:06.800
Not only was I treated worse than others, I was being treated worse than fresh men as a senior.

11:06.800 --> 11:11.440
In case you haven't pieced together the puzzle yet, there's a bit of a theme emerging here.

11:11.440 --> 11:16.640
For some bizarre fucking reason, my high school in 2015 decided that it was time

11:16.640 --> 11:20.160
for the seniors to take a backseat to fucking freshmen.

11:20.160 --> 11:24.000
For three years I busted my ass not going to parties and not fucking around and not

11:24.000 --> 11:26.080
treating high school like a big fucking joke.

11:26.080 --> 11:30.800
I aced all the standardized tests that you administrators wear like a fucking badge of honor.

11:30.800 --> 11:33.040
I always followed the rules and never got in trouble,

11:33.040 --> 11:37.680
and then I get to the oh so prestigious senior year and what do you give me?

11:37.680 --> 11:40.800
A slap in my fucking face and a piss stream in my mouth.

11:40.800 --> 11:45.680
I'm not asking for a fucking medal, I'm just asking for a little bit of fucking respect.

11:45.680 --> 11:50.800
But no, you stick me a notch under the freshly hatched 8th graders on the school totem pole.

11:50.800 --> 11:52.880
You're gonna give out the choice lockers to the kids

11:52.880 --> 11:56.320
who think that half an hour of homework and one test per week is hard?

11:56.320 --> 12:00.960
You're gonna ruin my honors parking spot so that I can get blocked by a fat SUV

12:00.960 --> 12:03.920
driven by an even fatter housewife just so that little

12:03.920 --> 12:06.880
billy freshman can get picked up 10 minutes earlier?

12:06.880 --> 12:09.360
And if you're a freshman watching this video I'm fucking sorry,

12:09.360 --> 12:11.920
but you need to know your role and shut your mouth.

12:11.920 --> 12:16.320
Come talk to me when your parents no longer have to drive you around everywhere you go.

12:16.320 --> 12:19.840
Anyway, like I said earlier, this whole series of events just ruined

12:19.840 --> 12:22.640
my entire senior year before it even began.

12:23.360 --> 12:26.720
Because honestly, what did I have to look forward to for the rest of the year?

12:26.720 --> 12:29.200
I was in senior year of IB.

12:29.200 --> 12:29.920
CANCER!

12:29.920 --> 12:33.120
If you don't know what that is, it's basically expert mode of high school.

12:33.120 --> 12:36.720
It's just like regular classes, except you have four times as much homework,

12:36.720 --> 12:38.720
have to write a research paper for every class,

12:38.720 --> 12:42.000
and have to prepare for 20 plus hours of exams at the end of the year

12:42.000 --> 12:43.520
when everyone else has stopped working,

12:43.520 --> 12:46.560
and you delude yourself into thinking that the work will end,

12:46.560 --> 12:47.360
but it won't.

12:47.360 --> 12:49.520
It's just an endless stream and it's never ogre.

12:49.520 --> 12:51.760
Just a boatload of fun for the whole family.

12:51.760 --> 12:55.600
Oh, and don't forget a bunch of college applications sprinkled in between the rest of the fun.

12:55.600 --> 12:59.120
This was stuff that I was expecting to do anyway, so I'm not really complaining about it,

12:59.120 --> 13:04.080
but doing it under a school regime which completely disrespects you

13:04.080 --> 13:06.160
gets really demoralizing really quickly.

13:06.160 --> 13:10.080
And for the remaining 170 school days, that's how I operated.

13:10.080 --> 13:13.760
And that, for me, was the worst part of senior year,

13:13.760 --> 13:17.360
knowing that no matter how maturely I acted and how hard I worked,

13:17.360 --> 13:20.560
in spite of when I turned 18 and legally became an adult,

13:20.560 --> 13:24.400
this school was going to treat me like a fucking mentally retarded child

13:24.400 --> 13:27.200
until I walked out of those doors for the final time.

13:27.200 --> 13:29.600
All those beautiful days in autumn and spring,

13:29.600 --> 13:32.400
wasted, as I sit, caged in a room,

13:32.400 --> 13:35.680
studying subjects that I would immediately forget after being tested on it,

13:35.680 --> 13:38.800
all so that I could compete in the rat race to get into college.

13:38.800 --> 13:41.680
And day after day, you sit, indoors,

13:41.680 --> 13:45.600
occasionally glancing out of the window, watching the birds fly free,

13:45.600 --> 13:48.320
and wanting nothing more than to join them, even for a minute.

13:48.320 --> 13:53.280
But no, you have to take notes on 20th century single-party authoritarian leaders.

13:53.280 --> 13:54.080
Whoopity-doo!

13:54.640 --> 13:58.480
Hundreds of days pass and you know in your head that the end is approaching,

13:58.480 --> 14:00.160
but the days don't feel any different.

14:00.160 --> 14:01.120
They're all the same.

14:01.120 --> 14:03.200
They've been the same for the last 11 grades.

14:03.200 --> 14:07.680
You've spent the last 11 years of your life consuming and regurgitating information in a room,

14:07.680 --> 14:11.360
watching the birds outside for a second, then going back to watching your textbook.

14:11.360 --> 14:13.120
You know, the most important thing.

14:13.120 --> 14:17.040
Sure, textbooks change, but you haven't, at least in the eyes of the school.

14:17.040 --> 14:22.160
You're just student number 397135, a statistic.

14:22.160 --> 14:24.560
And it doesn't fucking matter how the school treats you,

14:24.560 --> 14:26.480
because you're just gonna come to school anyway,

14:26.480 --> 14:32.000
day after day, doing more homework, more projects, more essays, more studying, more exams.

14:32.960 --> 14:35.920
And then all of a sudden, it's over.

14:38.160 --> 14:38.660
Sike!

14:39.760 --> 14:40.800
Well, that's my story.

14:40.800 --> 14:44.800
Most of the time when someone tells a story of school problems,

14:44.800 --> 14:47.600
it involves some bully or an asshole teacher.

14:47.600 --> 14:50.080
But my experience is just so bizarre,

14:50.080 --> 14:56.080
because the only real antagonist I faced was the school administration itself.

14:56.080 --> 14:59.200
I can't even pin this on one individual in charge.

14:59.200 --> 15:01.280
And at the risk of sounding cliche,

15:01.280 --> 15:05.280
the only way to describe it was that I was just getting worked over by the system.

15:05.280 --> 15:09.600
For some reason, I was under the impression that senior year was supposed to be this grand hurrah

15:09.600 --> 15:12.400
to celebrate the end of 12 years of public education.

15:12.400 --> 15:13.760
And maybe it is for most people,

15:13.760 --> 15:17.520
but for me, the notion that senior year of high school was supposed to be

15:18.080 --> 15:23.040
one of the best years of my life was a bigger crock of shit than Shrek's outhouse.

15:23.040 --> 15:25.200
But that's not to say it was all bad.

15:25.200 --> 15:27.760
I liked talking about this bullshit with my friends.

15:27.760 --> 15:29.120
I liked when it was over.

15:29.120 --> 15:30.400
And now that I've thought about it,

15:30.400 --> 15:33.440
in spite of literally everything I've said in the past 10 minutes,

15:33.440 --> 15:37.120
I can actually say that this whole experience actually benefited me in the long run.

15:37.120 --> 15:39.040
Sure, the school has treated me unfairly,

15:39.040 --> 15:40.800
but you know what else is unfair?

15:40.800 --> 15:41.360
Life.

15:41.360 --> 15:43.760
It's just inevitable that whether you expect it or not,

15:43.760 --> 15:45.520
you're gonna get fucked in the ass.

15:45.520 --> 15:49.120
And there's absolutely nothing you can do about it other than

15:49.120 --> 15:49.760
bend over,

15:50.320 --> 15:51.120
hold your breath,

15:51.840 --> 15:53.440
unclench your sphincter,

15:53.440 --> 15:56.160
and just fucking take it.

15:56.160 --> 15:59.520
I apologize for the lack of a cathartic resolution,

15:59.520 --> 16:01.600
but that's just the way it is.

16:01.600 --> 16:05.440
This is a lesson that everyone will learn at one time or another.

16:05.440 --> 16:08.720
And I was lucky enough to learn this when I was still in high school

16:08.720 --> 16:11.200
during a time when, if I fucking crashed and burned,

16:11.200 --> 16:13.600
I still had a safety net to fall back on.

16:13.600 --> 16:15.680
Right now I'm beginning my first year of college,

16:15.680 --> 16:19.520
and so far it feels like school has reset to kindergarten.

16:19.520 --> 16:21.040
Not in the sense that it's easy.

16:21.040 --> 16:22.400
Quite the opposite, actually.

16:22.400 --> 16:26.960
I'm making this comparison because the transition into both college and kindergarten

16:26.960 --> 16:30.160
involves a major alteration of life as you know it.

16:30.160 --> 16:35.760
The process of becoming an autonomous, fully functional adult is a huge leap,

16:35.760 --> 16:38.720
which I'm actively trying to perform every day now.

16:38.720 --> 16:41.920
And if I had just cruised through high school problem-free,

16:41.920 --> 16:44.400
and then something like this happened to me now,

16:44.400 --> 16:47.600
I'm honestly not sure if I would be able to handle it.

16:47.600 --> 16:50.480
But in reality, I did go through this tumultuous experience,

16:50.480 --> 16:55.200
and now I am stronger and more equipped to handle future situations like it.

16:55.200 --> 16:59.760
I also believe that this whole experience profoundly changed my attitude towards life

16:59.760 --> 17:00.400
for the better.

17:00.400 --> 17:04.880
This past summer after graduation was without a doubt the greatest time of my entire life.

17:04.880 --> 17:09.840
I was just so fucking happy not to be in high school anymore.

17:09.840 --> 17:10.880
And I'm still happy.

17:10.880 --> 17:12.800
So I guess at the end of the day I've got to say,

17:13.440 --> 17:16.480
thank you senior year of high school for fucking me.

17:17.040 --> 17:19.440
It was the most valuable lesson you ever taught me.

17:19.440 --> 17:46.480
And hey, while you're unsubscribing from me because this isn't a YouTube poop,

17:46.480 --> 17:48.560
you might want to check out my sweet mate's channel.

17:48.560 --> 17:51.040
He makes agar.io videos if you're interested in that kind of stuff.
