0	5760	There's four hundred and four days of summer vacation, and then school comes along just to fall
7760	11280	Oh boy, would you look at that? Summer is over already.
11280	14880	Seems like just yesterday that I was rolling into June on the meme express.
16640	19520	Anyway, I've started college. Super hyped for that.
19520	24640	But this video is about something that happened to me about this time last year.
24640	28800	I'm talking about when I entered senior year of high school.
28800	34640	Now, I should preface this by saying that I really, really, really try not to be an edgy person.
34640	39840	I actually try to enjoy life, I try to have a positive attitude whenever I can,
39840	43360	and I don't like to complain about my situation and disposition
43360	47120	unless I've experienced something completely infuriating.
47120	49040	This is one of those cases.
49040	54960	Out of everything, if I had to choose one topic about my life to complain about, this would be it.
54960	56480	Because if you ask me the question,
56480	61120	Hey M, what's the angriest you've ever been in your entire life?
61120	63440	This story is about that point.
63440	65920	Like I said earlier, I'm not usually in a bad mood.
66560	69360	I can probably count on two hands the number of times per year
69360	72400	when I'm legitimately pissed off for more than a few hours at a time.
72960	76320	I just tend to get over stuff really easily and move on.
76320	81760	However, the reason this story is so significant is because I was pissed off not for a few hours,
81760	87440	not for a few days, but legitimately for an entire month, from August through September of last year.
88240	91600	Ladies and gentlemen, this is the story of the series of events
91600	94880	which led me to the angriest stage of my entire life.
97520	101520	Our story begins the first fucking day of senior year.
101520	103440	Well, actually it starts even before that.
103440	107440	You see, I went to public school in the same school district since the fourth grade,
107440	112000	and every single year the school would begin sometime around August 20th.
112000	117280	Yet despite this, the school board inexplicably decided to move the start date of school
117280	119760	to August 10th for my final year.
119760	122000	Lame lame lame lame lame!
122000	126800	So I effectively got robbed of an entire week of my final summer vacation.
126800	128640	This didn't really bother me too much,
128640	133440	but during the first week I was slightly annoyed that I was stuck in school on dates,
133440	136320	which for the previous decade was still summer vacation.
136320	138640	But in all honesty, I wasn't too disappointed.
138640	140880	It was just one inconvenience after all.
144800	146240	Also starting in senior year,
146240	150160	the school library suddenly became a slight bit incompetent.
152000	154080	In all three previous years at my high school,
154080	158160	it never took me more than two separate trips to the library
158160	160800	before I got all of my textbooks for my classes.
160800	165200	In senior year, it took me at least four Chicken McNuggets.
165280	166400	I may have lost count.
166400	168400	First the system was down, then the books were missing,
168400	172720	then a bunch of logistical problems that I'd never experienced before at this school.
172720	175280	At this point I was still just slightly annoyed,
175280	176160	but I carried on.
179680	182560	At the beginning of every school year, I like to buy a planner.
183200	186800	A little notebook for writing assignments and test dates.
186800	191840	I relied on it to remember the dozens of assignments I had on a weekly basis,
191840	195680	so I walk over to the front office on day two of school,
195680	198480	and they tell me that they're sold out of planners.
198480	200160	On day fucking two.
200160	204960	Keep in mind that in the 11 previous years of school which I've experienced,
204960	209920	whichever school I was in never ran out of planners until at least October,
209920	212160	much less the second fucking day.
212160	217440	I later learned that the bulk of the planners were sold at the freshman orientation,
217520	221920	but that doesn't really excuse the school for running out of planners on the second day.
221920	224400	It just shows a complete lack of planning on their part.
224400	227520	Now at this point I was becoming fairly frustrated
227520	232960	that there were already three separate upsetting incidents by day two of senior year,
232960	235520	but oh boy, that was just the beginning.
239120	243200	Here's where the story starts getting good, and by that I mean bad, very bad.
243200	245040	So I need a locker.
245040	248640	I'm taking advanced classes, and I have a lot of books and binders,
249440	252240	and I need a place to put my stuff, so get this.
254000	263280	High school thought it would be a good idea to let fresh men pick their lockers first,
264000	267200	then sophomores, then juniors and seniors.
267200	271520	Why freshmen were given the priority over seniors yet again, I'll never know.
271520	273040	It should also be noted that over the summer,
273040	276960	the county had changed the zoning laws over high school attendance,
276960	281840	so this year there were about 200 more freshmen than there were in the previous year.
281840	286400	This is important, because by the time I got to pick my locker,
286400	288880	nearly all of the lockers were taken.
288880	294320	There was only one group of lockers in the middle of all my classes with vacancies still available.
294320	296000	If I picked a locker anywhere else,
296000	300320	I would risk being late for at least one of my classes throughout the day.
300320	303760	So I scout out the lockers over there, and boy, it's slim pickings.
303760	306720	I did spot one that was available that I could tolerate,
306720	311600	so I go to rent it, but the clerk says that somebody already owned it.
311600	313040	For those of you who don't know,
313040	318080	it's a pretty common practice to turn locks upside down if the locker is vacant,
318080	320000	and right side up if it's in use.
320000	323840	The locker I saw had a lock which was upside down,
323840	326080	but apparently somebody had already rented it.
326080	329280	So at this point, lunch is almost over, and I need to get the class soon,
329280	330560	so I just say fuck it.
330560	334160	I ask the clerk, can you just give me any locker in this area that's vacant?
334720	337680	Ooh, looks like this one's available.
337680	343680	Let's just say that there was a reason that this locker was available,
343680	346080	because the locker I got was
346080	348320	DAVEY JONES LOCKER!
348320	349600	DISGUSTING!
349600	352160	It was a bottom locker in a corner,
352160	357840	and I knew the roof leaked over it because the ground underneath was covered with black stuff,
357840	360880	as opposed to the gray concrete typical the school.
360880	364160	I think it was a combination of dirt, mold, and rat feces,
364160	366720	and every time it rained, water would fall from the ceiling
366720	369760	and splatter the black stuff all over my locker door.
369760	375040	I felt like each day I would get hepatitis, AIDS, or some undiscovered disease
375040	380320	because I'm certain that the forces of evolution were hard at work in that black stuff.
380320	385040	The lock itself was nearly rusted shut from the water exposure, and it barely worked.
385680	387840	It took me so long fiddling with the combination
387840	391600	that I just had to leave it unlocked at all times to avoid being late for class.
391600	394640	One day there was an exceptionally heavy rainstorm,
394640	400400	which kicked up enough water that one of the books inside of my locker actually got waterlogged.
400400	404640	So what we had here was a locker that couldn't lock and couldn't provide shelter,
405440	408880	and I paid five dollars for the privilege to use this thing.
408880	413440	After that textbook got soiled,
413440	416800	I just gave up and started stowing my books in the backseat of my car.
416800	420640	I called it the La Car. Get it? Haha, I'm so clever and funny.
420640	422480	Oh boy, and speaking of my car...
425200	429120	Funny thing is I actually made a video about this on my alt about a year ago,
429120	432160	the day that it happened, and you can look it up, it's still there.
432800	437040	But if you don't want to watch it, long story short, I'm a tryhard at school.
437600	439040	I like getting good grades.
439040	444320	I got my GPA high enough that by senior year I qualified for honor student parking,
444320	448160	which was much nicer than the shithole that was the general student's parking.
448160	449920	HOLY SHIT
449920	453360	It was closer to the school, and you could leave as soon as school ended.
453360	459040	It's just a little carrot for the kids who have endured the miles upon miles of stick
459040	461600	required to get to the top five percent of the class.
461600	464400	Now before I talk about what happens next, all of you need to know
465120	469040	that the events which I've already described in this video
469600	474400	have been happening one after the other, and for the first two weeks of school,
474400	480400	my frustration has been building and building to the point where I'm almost at my breaking point.
480400	484080	I like to think about a concept of what I call nuclear rage.
484640	490080	It's a level of anger which is just a cut above any period of common rage.
490080	494240	It's a stage where you just lose control of your cognitive abilities,
494240	496960	and you just become a faucet of fury.
496960	501120	You're not yourself anymore, you just become a primal beast of aggression,
501120	507440	and the anger takes full control of your body, and you completely fucking melt down.
507440	510080	It's like going Super Saiyan, but for anger.
510640	514480	I've only reached this level of rage a few times in my entire life,
515040	520320	and last year in 2015 my high school pushed me to this level,
520320	525280	because on one afternoon I returned to my car in the parking lot and see that it's been blocked!
528480	534000	No seriously, my school built a wall of fucking automobiles to keep me in school.
534640	536480	What the fuck is this?
536480	541840	I should explain here that my high school has always had a traffic problem.
544480	555040	But rather than actually tackling the root of the problem and redesigning the shitty roads,
555040	559040	they just decided to hot fix everything by cutting as many corners as possible.
559040	564320	So the school sacrificed the honors parking lot to the traffic gods by funneling all of
564320	568960	the parent pickup traffic through the honors parking lot so that you cannot physically
568960	572400	pull out of your parking spot unless the traffic allowed you.
572400	574480	I went to talk to the principal after seeing this,
575280	580720	and he unapologetically informed me that this was a permanent traffic change.
582080	584720	TACTICAL NUKE, INCOMING!
593600	598720	This is the final straw.
602400	612320	It was at this point when I completely lost all respect and faith in my high school,
612320	614960	and I'd actually liked my high school up until this time.
614960	620320	It was at this point when senior year was completely soiled beyond any scrap of repair.
620320	623280	It took my school two and a half fucking weeks.
623280	628960	That parking spot was the one final solitary thing that I was clinging to to tell myself,
628960	633360	well at least I have this, and my school had to fuck that up for me too.
633360	637600	I don't want to come off as entitled by saying this whole spiel because
637600	642400	I could honestly care less about having a functional locker and a good parking spot,
642400	649440	but when I am being blatantly treated worse than every other student in this school
650160	655440	for basically no reason, being denied basic school services that were available
655440	659840	to the last 10 grades before me, that's where I draw the fucking line.
659840	666800	Not only was I treated worse than others, I was being treated worse than fresh men as a senior.
666800	671440	In case you haven't pieced together the puzzle yet, there's a bit of a theme emerging here.
671440	676640	For some bizarre fucking reason, my high school in 2015 decided that it was time
676640	680160	for the seniors to take a backseat to fucking freshmen.
680160	684000	For three years I busted my ass not going to parties and not fucking around and not
684000	686080	treating high school like a big fucking joke.
686080	690800	I aced all the standardized tests that you administrators wear like a fucking badge of honor.
690800	693040	I always followed the rules and never got in trouble,
693040	697680	and then I get to the oh so prestigious senior year and what do you give me?
697680	700800	A slap in my fucking face and a piss stream in my mouth.
700800	705680	I'm not asking for a fucking medal, I'm just asking for a little bit of fucking respect.
705680	710800	But no, you stick me a notch under the freshly hatched 8th graders on the school totem pole.
710800	712880	You're gonna give out the choice lockers to the kids
712880	716320	who think that half an hour of homework and one test per week is hard?
716320	720960	You're gonna ruin my honors parking spot so that I can get blocked by a fat SUV
720960	723920	driven by an even fatter housewife just so that little
723920	726880	billy freshman can get picked up 10 minutes earlier?
726880	729360	And if you're a freshman watching this video I'm fucking sorry,
729360	731920	but you need to know your role and shut your mouth.
731920	736320	Come talk to me when your parents no longer have to drive you around everywhere you go.
736320	739840	Anyway, like I said earlier, this whole series of events just ruined
739840	742640	my entire senior year before it even began.
743360	746720	Because honestly, what did I have to look forward to for the rest of the year?
746720	749200	I was in senior year of IB.
749200	749920	CANCER!
749920	753120	If you don't know what that is, it's basically expert mode of high school.
753120	756720	It's just like regular classes, except you have four times as much homework,
756720	758720	have to write a research paper for every class,
758720	762000	and have to prepare for 20 plus hours of exams at the end of the year
762000	763520	when everyone else has stopped working,
763520	766560	and you delude yourself into thinking that the work will end,
766560	767360	but it won't.
767360	769520	It's just an endless stream and it's never ogre.
769520	771760	Just a boatload of fun for the whole family.
771760	775600	Oh, and don't forget a bunch of college applications sprinkled in between the rest of the fun.
775600	779120	This was stuff that I was expecting to do anyway, so I'm not really complaining about it,
779120	784080	but doing it under a school regime which completely disrespects you
784080	786160	gets really demoralizing really quickly.
786160	790080	And for the remaining 170 school days, that's how I operated.
790080	793760	And that, for me, was the worst part of senior year,
793760	797360	knowing that no matter how maturely I acted and how hard I worked,
797360	800560	in spite of when I turned 18 and legally became an adult,
800560	804400	this school was going to treat me like a fucking mentally retarded child
804400	807200	until I walked out of those doors for the final time.
807200	809600	All those beautiful days in autumn and spring,
809600	812400	wasted, as I sit, caged in a room,
812400	815680	studying subjects that I would immediately forget after being tested on it,
815680	818800	all so that I could compete in the rat race to get into college.
818800	821680	And day after day, you sit, indoors,
821680	825600	occasionally glancing out of the window, watching the birds fly free,
825600	828320	and wanting nothing more than to join them, even for a minute.
828320	833280	But no, you have to take notes on 20th century single-party authoritarian leaders.
833280	834080	Whoopity-doo!
834640	838480	Hundreds of days pass and you know in your head that the end is approaching,
838480	840160	but the days don't feel any different.
840160	841120	They're all the same.
841120	843200	They've been the same for the last 11 grades.
843200	847680	You've spent the last 11 years of your life consuming and regurgitating information in a room,
847680	851360	watching the birds outside for a second, then going back to watching your textbook.
851360	853120	You know, the most important thing.
853120	857040	Sure, textbooks change, but you haven't, at least in the eyes of the school.
857040	862160	You're just student number 397135, a statistic.
862160	864560	And it doesn't fucking matter how the school treats you,
864560	866480	because you're just gonna come to school anyway,
866480	872000	day after day, doing more homework, more projects, more essays, more studying, more exams.
872960	875920	And then all of a sudden, it's over.
878160	878660	Sike!
879760	880800	Well, that's my story.
880800	884800	Most of the time when someone tells a story of school problems,
884800	887600	it involves some bully or an asshole teacher.
887600	890080	But my experience is just so bizarre,
890080	896080	because the only real antagonist I faced was the school administration itself.
896080	899200	I can't even pin this on one individual in charge.
899200	901280	And at the risk of sounding cliche,
901280	905280	the only way to describe it was that I was just getting worked over by the system.
905280	909600	For some reason, I was under the impression that senior year was supposed to be this grand hurrah
909600	912400	to celebrate the end of 12 years of public education.
912400	913760	And maybe it is for most people,
913760	917520	but for me, the notion that senior year of high school was supposed to be
918080	923040	one of the best years of my life was a bigger crock of shit than Shrek's outhouse.
923040	925200	But that's not to say it was all bad.
925200	927760	I liked talking about this bullshit with my friends.
927760	929120	I liked when it was over.
929120	930400	And now that I've thought about it,
930400	933440	in spite of literally everything I've said in the past 10 minutes,
933440	937120	I can actually say that this whole experience actually benefited me in the long run.
937120	939040	Sure, the school has treated me unfairly,
939040	940800	but you know what else is unfair?
940800	941360	Life.
941360	943760	It's just inevitable that whether you expect it or not,
943760	945520	you're gonna get fucked in the ass.
945520	949120	And there's absolutely nothing you can do about it other than
949120	949760	bend over,
950320	951120	hold your breath,
951840	953440	unclench your sphincter,
953440	956160	and just fucking take it.
956160	959520	I apologize for the lack of a cathartic resolution,
959520	961600	but that's just the way it is.
961600	965440	This is a lesson that everyone will learn at one time or another.
965440	968720	And I was lucky enough to learn this when I was still in high school
968720	971200	during a time when, if I fucking crashed and burned,
971200	973600	I still had a safety net to fall back on.
973600	975680	Right now I'm beginning my first year of college,
975680	979520	and so far it feels like school has reset to kindergarten.
979520	981040	Not in the sense that it's easy.
981040	982400	Quite the opposite, actually.
982400	986960	I'm making this comparison because the transition into both college and kindergarten
986960	990160	involves a major alteration of life as you know it.
990160	995760	The process of becoming an autonomous, fully functional adult is a huge leap,
995760	998720	which I'm actively trying to perform every day now.
998720	1001920	And if I had just cruised through high school problem-free,
1001920	1004400	and then something like this happened to me now,
1004400	1007600	I'm honestly not sure if I would be able to handle it.
1007600	1010480	But in reality, I did go through this tumultuous experience,
1010480	1015200	and now I am stronger and more equipped to handle future situations like it.
1015200	1019760	I also believe that this whole experience profoundly changed my attitude towards life
1019760	1020400	for the better.
1020400	1024880	This past summer after graduation was without a doubt the greatest time of my entire life.
1024880	1029840	I was just so fucking happy not to be in high school anymore.
1029840	1030880	And I'm still happy.
1030880	1032800	So I guess at the end of the day I've got to say,
1033440	1036480	thank you senior year of high school for fucking me.
1037040	1039440	It was the most valuable lesson you ever taught me.
1039440	1066480	And hey, while you're unsubscribing from me because this isn't a YouTube poop,
1066480	1068560	you might want to check out my sweet mate's channel.
1068560	1071040	He makes agar.io videos if you're interested in that kind of stuff.
