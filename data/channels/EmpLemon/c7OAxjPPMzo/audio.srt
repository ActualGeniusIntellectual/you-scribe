1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,760
There's four hundred and four days of summer vacation, and then school comes along just to fall

2
00:00:07,760 --> 00:00:11,280
Oh boy, would you look at that? Summer is over already.

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:14,880
Seems like just yesterday that I was rolling into June on the meme express.

4
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:19,520
Anyway, I've started college. Super hyped for that.

5
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:24,640
But this video is about something that happened to me about this time last year.

6
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:28,800
I'm talking about when I entered senior year of high school.

7
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:34,640
Now, I should preface this by saying that I really, really, really try not to be an edgy person.

8
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:39,840
I actually try to enjoy life, I try to have a positive attitude whenever I can,

9
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:43,360
and I don't like to complain about my situation and disposition

10
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:47,120
unless I've experienced something completely infuriating.

11
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:49,040
This is one of those cases.

12
00:00:49,040 --> 00:00:54,960
Out of everything, if I had to choose one topic about my life to complain about, this would be it.

13
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:56,480
Because if you ask me the question,

14
00:00:56,480 --> 00:01:01,120
Hey M, what's the angriest you've ever been in your entire life?

15
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:03,440
This story is about that point.

16
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:05,920
Like I said earlier, I'm not usually in a bad mood.

17
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:09,360
I can probably count on two hands the number of times per year

18
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:12,400
when I'm legitimately pissed off for more than a few hours at a time.

19
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:16,320
I just tend to get over stuff really easily and move on.

20
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:21,760
However, the reason this story is so significant is because I was pissed off not for a few hours,

21
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:27,440
not for a few days, but legitimately for an entire month, from August through September of last year.

22
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:31,600
Ladies and gentlemen, this is the story of the series of events

23
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:34,880
which led me to the angriest stage of my entire life.

24
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:41,520
Our story begins the first fucking day of senior year.

25
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:43,440
Well, actually it starts even before that.

26
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:47,440
You see, I went to public school in the same school district since the fourth grade,

27
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:52,000
and every single year the school would begin sometime around August 20th.

28
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:57,280
Yet despite this, the school board inexplicably decided to move the start date of school

29
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:59,760
to August 10th for my final year.

30
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:02,000
Lame lame lame lame lame!

31
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:06,800
So I effectively got robbed of an entire week of my final summer vacation.

32
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:08,640
This didn't really bother me too much,

33
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:13,440
but during the first week I was slightly annoyed that I was stuck in school on dates,

34
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:16,320
which for the previous decade was still summer vacation.

35
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:18,640
But in all honesty, I wasn't too disappointed.

36
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:20,880
It was just one inconvenience after all.

37
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:26,240
Also starting in senior year,

38
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:30,160
the school library suddenly became a slight bit incompetent.

39
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,080
In all three previous years at my high school,

40
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:38,160
it never took me more than two separate trips to the library

41
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:40,800
before I got all of my textbooks for my classes.

42
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:45,200
In senior year, it took me at least four Chicken McNuggets.

43
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:46,400
I may have lost count.

44
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:48,400
First the system was down, then the books were missing,

45
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:52,720
then a bunch of logistical problems that I'd never experienced before at this school.

46
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:55,280
At this point I was still just slightly annoyed,

47
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:56,160
but I carried on.

48
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:02,560
At the beginning of every school year, I like to buy a planner.

49
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:06,800
A little notebook for writing assignments and test dates.

50
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:11,840
I relied on it to remember the dozens of assignments I had on a weekly basis,

51
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:15,680
so I walk over to the front office on day two of school,

52
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:18,480
and they tell me that they're sold out of planners.

53
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:20,160
On day fucking two.

54
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:24,960
Keep in mind that in the 11 previous years of school which I've experienced,

55
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:29,920
whichever school I was in never ran out of planners until at least October,

56
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:32,160
much less the second fucking day.

57
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:37,440
I later learned that the bulk of the planners were sold at the freshman orientation,

58
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:41,920
but that doesn't really excuse the school for running out of planners on the second day.

59
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:44,400
It just shows a complete lack of planning on their part.

60
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:47,520
Now at this point I was becoming fairly frustrated

61
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:52,960
that there were already three separate upsetting incidents by day two of senior year,

62
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:55,520
but oh boy, that was just the beginning.

63
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:03,200
Here's where the story starts getting good, and by that I mean bad, very bad.

64
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:05,040
So I need a locker.

65
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:08,640
I'm taking advanced classes, and I have a lot of books and binders,

66
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:12,240
and I need a place to put my stuff, so get this.

67
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:23,280
High school thought it would be a good idea to let fresh men pick their lockers first,

68
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,200
then sophomores, then juniors and seniors.

69
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:31,520
Why freshmen were given the priority over seniors yet again, I'll never know.

70
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:33,040
It should also be noted that over the summer,

71
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:36,960
the county had changed the zoning laws over high school attendance,

72
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:41,840
so this year there were about 200 more freshmen than there were in the previous year.

73
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:46,400
This is important, because by the time I got to pick my locker,

74
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:48,880
nearly all of the lockers were taken.

75
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:54,320
There was only one group of lockers in the middle of all my classes with vacancies still available.

76
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:56,000
If I picked a locker anywhere else,

77
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:00,320
I would risk being late for at least one of my classes throughout the day.

78
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:03,760
So I scout out the lockers over there, and boy, it's slim pickings.

79
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:06,720
I did spot one that was available that I could tolerate,

80
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:11,600
so I go to rent it, but the clerk says that somebody already owned it.

81
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:13,040
For those of you who don't know,

82
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:18,080
it's a pretty common practice to turn locks upside down if the locker is vacant,

83
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:20,000
and right side up if it's in use.

84
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:23,840
The locker I saw had a lock which was upside down,

85
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:26,080
but apparently somebody had already rented it.

86
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:29,280
So at this point, lunch is almost over, and I need to get the class soon,

87
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:30,560
so I just say fuck it.

88
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:34,160
I ask the clerk, can you just give me any locker in this area that's vacant?

89
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:37,680
Ooh, looks like this one's available.

90
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:43,680
Let's just say that there was a reason that this locker was available,

91
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:46,080
because the locker I got was

92
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:48,320
DAVEY JONES LOCKER!

93
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:49,600
DISGUSTING!

94
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:52,160
It was a bottom locker in a corner,

95
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:57,840
and I knew the roof leaked over it because the ground underneath was covered with black stuff,

96
00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:00,880
as opposed to the gray concrete typical the school.

97
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:04,160
I think it was a combination of dirt, mold, and rat feces,

98
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:06,720
and every time it rained, water would fall from the ceiling

99
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:09,760
and splatter the black stuff all over my locker door.

100
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:15,040
I felt like each day I would get hepatitis, AIDS, or some undiscovered disease

101
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:20,320
because I'm certain that the forces of evolution were hard at work in that black stuff.

102
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:25,040
The lock itself was nearly rusted shut from the water exposure, and it barely worked.

103
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:27,840
It took me so long fiddling with the combination

104
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:31,600
that I just had to leave it unlocked at all times to avoid being late for class.

105
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:34,640
One day there was an exceptionally heavy rainstorm,

106
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:40,400
which kicked up enough water that one of the books inside of my locker actually got waterlogged.

107
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:44,640
So what we had here was a locker that couldn't lock and couldn't provide shelter,

108
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:48,880
and I paid five dollars for the privilege to use this thing.

109
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:53,440
After that textbook got soiled,

110
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:56,800
I just gave up and started stowing my books in the backseat of my car.

111
00:06:56,800 --> 00:07:00,640
I called it the La Car. Get it? Haha, I'm so clever and funny.

112
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:02,480
Oh boy, and speaking of my car...

113
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:09,120
Funny thing is I actually made a video about this on my alt about a year ago,

114
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:12,160
the day that it happened, and you can look it up, it's still there.

115
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:17,040
But if you don't want to watch it, long story short, I'm a tryhard at school.

116
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:19,040
I like getting good grades.

117
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:24,320
I got my GPA high enough that by senior year I qualified for honor student parking,

118
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:28,160
which was much nicer than the shithole that was the general student's parking.

119
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:29,920
HOLY SHIT

120
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:33,360
It was closer to the school, and you could leave as soon as school ended.

121
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:39,040
It's just a little carrot for the kids who have endured the miles upon miles of stick

122
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:41,600
required to get to the top five percent of the class.

123
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:44,400
Now before I talk about what happens next, all of you need to know

124
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:49,040
that the events which I've already described in this video

125
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:54,400
have been happening one after the other, and for the first two weeks of school,

126
00:07:54,400 --> 00:08:00,400
my frustration has been building and building to the point where I'm almost at my breaking point.

127
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:04,080
I like to think about a concept of what I call nuclear rage.

128
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:10,080
It's a level of anger which is just a cut above any period of common rage.

129
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:14,240
It's a stage where you just lose control of your cognitive abilities,

130
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:16,960
and you just become a faucet of fury.

131
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:21,120
You're not yourself anymore, you just become a primal beast of aggression,

132
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:27,440
and the anger takes full control of your body, and you completely fucking melt down.

133
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:30,080
It's like going Super Saiyan, but for anger.

134
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:34,480
I've only reached this level of rage a few times in my entire life,

135
00:08:35,040 --> 00:08:40,320
and last year in 2015 my high school pushed me to this level,

136
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:45,280
because on one afternoon I returned to my car in the parking lot and see that it's been blocked!

137
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:54,000
No seriously, my school built a wall of fucking automobiles to keep me in school.

138
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:56,480
What the fuck is this?

139
00:08:56,480 --> 00:09:01,840
I should explain here that my high school has always had a traffic problem.

140
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:15,040
But rather than actually tackling the root of the problem and redesigning the shitty roads,

141
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:19,040
they just decided to hot fix everything by cutting as many corners as possible.

142
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:24,320
So the school sacrificed the honors parking lot to the traffic gods by funneling all of

143
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:28,960
the parent pickup traffic through the honors parking lot so that you cannot physically

144
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:32,400
pull out of your parking spot unless the traffic allowed you.

145
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:34,480
I went to talk to the principal after seeing this,

146
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:40,720
and he unapologetically informed me that this was a permanent traffic change.

147
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:44,720
TACTICAL NUKE, INCOMING!

148
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:58,720
This is the final straw.

149
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:12,320
It was at this point when I completely lost all respect and faith in my high school,

150
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:14,960
and I'd actually liked my high school up until this time.

151
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:20,320
It was at this point when senior year was completely soiled beyond any scrap of repair.

152
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:23,280
It took my school two and a half fucking weeks.

153
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:28,960
That parking spot was the one final solitary thing that I was clinging to to tell myself,

154
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:33,360
well at least I have this, and my school had to fuck that up for me too.

155
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:37,600
I don't want to come off as entitled by saying this whole spiel because

156
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:42,400
I could honestly care less about having a functional locker and a good parking spot,

157
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:49,440
but when I am being blatantly treated worse than every other student in this school

158
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:55,440
for basically no reason, being denied basic school services that were available

159
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:59,840
to the last 10 grades before me, that's where I draw the fucking line.

160
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:06,800
Not only was I treated worse than others, I was being treated worse than fresh men as a senior.

161
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:11,440
In case you haven't pieced together the puzzle yet, there's a bit of a theme emerging here.

162
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:16,640
For some bizarre fucking reason, my high school in 2015 decided that it was time

163
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:20,160
for the seniors to take a backseat to fucking freshmen.

164
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:24,000
For three years I busted my ass not going to parties and not fucking around and not

165
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,080
treating high school like a big fucking joke.

166
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:30,800
I aced all the standardized tests that you administrators wear like a fucking badge of honor.

167
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:33,040
I always followed the rules and never got in trouble,

168
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:37,680
and then I get to the oh so prestigious senior year and what do you give me?

169
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:40,800
A slap in my fucking face and a piss stream in my mouth.

170
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:45,680
I'm not asking for a fucking medal, I'm just asking for a little bit of fucking respect.

171
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:50,800
But no, you stick me a notch under the freshly hatched 8th graders on the school totem pole.

172
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:52,880
You're gonna give out the choice lockers to the kids

173
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:56,320
who think that half an hour of homework and one test per week is hard?

174
00:11:56,320 --> 00:12:00,960
You're gonna ruin my honors parking spot so that I can get blocked by a fat SUV

175
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:03,920
driven by an even fatter housewife just so that little

176
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:06,880
billy freshman can get picked up 10 minutes earlier?

177
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:09,360
And if you're a freshman watching this video I'm fucking sorry,

178
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:11,920
but you need to know your role and shut your mouth.

179
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:16,320
Come talk to me when your parents no longer have to drive you around everywhere you go.

180
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:19,840
Anyway, like I said earlier, this whole series of events just ruined

181
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:22,640
my entire senior year before it even began.

182
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:26,720
Because honestly, what did I have to look forward to for the rest of the year?

183
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:29,200
I was in senior year of IB.

184
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:29,920
CANCER!

185
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:33,120
If you don't know what that is, it's basically expert mode of high school.

186
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:36,720
It's just like regular classes, except you have four times as much homework,

187
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:38,720
have to write a research paper for every class,

188
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:42,000
and have to prepare for 20 plus hours of exams at the end of the year

189
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,520
when everyone else has stopped working,

190
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:46,560
and you delude yourself into thinking that the work will end,

191
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:47,360
but it won't.

192
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:49,520
It's just an endless stream and it's never ogre.

193
00:12:49,520 --> 00:12:51,760
Just a boatload of fun for the whole family.

194
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:55,600
Oh, and don't forget a bunch of college applications sprinkled in between the rest of the fun.

195
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:59,120
This was stuff that I was expecting to do anyway, so I'm not really complaining about it,

196
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:04,080
but doing it under a school regime which completely disrespects you

197
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:06,160
gets really demoralizing really quickly.

198
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:10,080
And for the remaining 170 school days, that's how I operated.

199
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:13,760
And that, for me, was the worst part of senior year,

200
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:17,360
knowing that no matter how maturely I acted and how hard I worked,

201
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:20,560
in spite of when I turned 18 and legally became an adult,

202
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:24,400
this school was going to treat me like a fucking mentally retarded child

203
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:27,200
until I walked out of those doors for the final time.

204
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:29,600
All those beautiful days in autumn and spring,

205
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:32,400
wasted, as I sit, caged in a room,

206
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:35,680
studying subjects that I would immediately forget after being tested on it,

207
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:38,800
all so that I could compete in the rat race to get into college.

208
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:41,680
And day after day, you sit, indoors,

209
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:45,600
occasionally glancing out of the window, watching the birds fly free,

210
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:48,320
and wanting nothing more than to join them, even for a minute.

211
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:53,280
But no, you have to take notes on 20th century single-party authoritarian leaders.

212
00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:54,080
Whoopity-doo!

213
00:13:54,640 --> 00:13:58,480
Hundreds of days pass and you know in your head that the end is approaching,

214
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:00,160
but the days don't feel any different.

215
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:01,120
They're all the same.

216
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:03,200
They've been the same for the last 11 grades.

217
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:07,680
You've spent the last 11 years of your life consuming and regurgitating information in a room,

218
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:11,360
watching the birds outside for a second, then going back to watching your textbook.

219
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:13,120
You know, the most important thing.

220
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:17,040
Sure, textbooks change, but you haven't, at least in the eyes of the school.

221
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:22,160
You're just student number 397135, a statistic.

222
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:24,560
And it doesn't fucking matter how the school treats you,

223
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:26,480
because you're just gonna come to school anyway,

224
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:32,000
day after day, doing more homework, more projects, more essays, more studying, more exams.

225
00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:35,920
And then all of a sudden, it's over.

226
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:38,660
Sike!

227
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:40,800
Well, that's my story.

228
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:44,800
Most of the time when someone tells a story of school problems,

229
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:47,600
it involves some bully or an asshole teacher.

230
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:50,080
But my experience is just so bizarre,

231
00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:56,080
because the only real antagonist I faced was the school administration itself.

232
00:14:56,080 --> 00:14:59,200
I can't even pin this on one individual in charge.

233
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:01,280
And at the risk of sounding cliche,

234
00:15:01,280 --> 00:15:05,280
the only way to describe it was that I was just getting worked over by the system.

235
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:09,600
For some reason, I was under the impression that senior year was supposed to be this grand hurrah

236
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:12,400
to celebrate the end of 12 years of public education.

237
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:13,760
And maybe it is for most people,

238
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:17,520
but for me, the notion that senior year of high school was supposed to be

239
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:23,040
one of the best years of my life was a bigger crock of shit than Shrek's outhouse.

240
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:25,200
But that's not to say it was all bad.

241
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:27,760
I liked talking about this bullshit with my friends.

242
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:29,120
I liked when it was over.

243
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:30,400
And now that I've thought about it,

244
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:33,440
in spite of literally everything I've said in the past 10 minutes,

245
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:37,120
I can actually say that this whole experience actually benefited me in the long run.

246
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:39,040
Sure, the school has treated me unfairly,

247
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:40,800
but you know what else is unfair?

248
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:41,360
Life.

249
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:43,760
It's just inevitable that whether you expect it or not,

250
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:45,520
you're gonna get fucked in the ass.

251
00:15:45,520 --> 00:15:49,120
And there's absolutely nothing you can do about it other than

252
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:49,760
bend over,

253
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:51,120
hold your breath,

254
00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:53,440
unclench your sphincter,

255
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:56,160
and just fucking take it.

256
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:59,520
I apologize for the lack of a cathartic resolution,

257
00:15:59,520 --> 00:16:01,600
but that's just the way it is.

258
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:05,440
This is a lesson that everyone will learn at one time or another.

259
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:08,720
And I was lucky enough to learn this when I was still in high school

260
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:11,200
during a time when, if I fucking crashed and burned,

261
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:13,600
I still had a safety net to fall back on.

262
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:15,680
Right now I'm beginning my first year of college,

263
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:19,520
and so far it feels like school has reset to kindergarten.

264
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:21,040
Not in the sense that it's easy.

265
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:22,400
Quite the opposite, actually.

266
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:26,960
I'm making this comparison because the transition into both college and kindergarten

267
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:30,160
involves a major alteration of life as you know it.

268
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:35,760
The process of becoming an autonomous, fully functional adult is a huge leap,

269
00:16:35,760 --> 00:16:38,720
which I'm actively trying to perform every day now.

270
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:41,920
And if I had just cruised through high school problem-free,

271
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:44,400
and then something like this happened to me now,

272
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:47,600
I'm honestly not sure if I would be able to handle it.

273
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:50,480
But in reality, I did go through this tumultuous experience,

274
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:55,200
and now I am stronger and more equipped to handle future situations like it.

275
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:59,760
I also believe that this whole experience profoundly changed my attitude towards life

276
00:16:59,760 --> 00:17:00,400
for the better.

277
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:04,880
This past summer after graduation was without a doubt the greatest time of my entire life.

278
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:09,840
I was just so fucking happy not to be in high school anymore.

279
00:17:09,840 --> 00:17:10,880
And I'm still happy.

280
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:12,800
So I guess at the end of the day I've got to say,

281
00:17:13,440 --> 00:17:16,480
thank you senior year of high school for fucking me.

282
00:17:17,040 --> 00:17:19,440
It was the most valuable lesson you ever taught me.

283
00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:46,480
And hey, while you're unsubscribing from me because this isn't a YouTube poop,

284
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:48,560
you might want to check out my sweet mate's channel.

285
00:17:48,560 --> 00:17:51,040
He makes agar.io videos if you're interested in that kind of stuff.
