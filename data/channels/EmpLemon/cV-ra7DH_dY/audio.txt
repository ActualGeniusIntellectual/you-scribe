I was on top of the site making gold fans right in my pocket
I was making the vids that everyone wanted to see
When from out of nowhere like an RKO I lost my quality content
Now all of a sudden I'm on a downward spiral mentally
I had friends, lots of internet friends Now all those friendships are over
And I try to remind myself that it's never over
I had views and subscribers too But now I've lost it all
You can never get back up when all you can do is fall
I've been on a downward spiral mentally On a downward spiral mentally
I've been On a downward spiral mentally
And now I've lost it completely Holy fuck
