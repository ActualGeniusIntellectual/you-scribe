0	6800	People of YouTube, it is I, the Duke of the Dank, the mayor of Meme Town,
6800	10400	everyone's favorite YouTuber, Emperor Lemon.
10400	15400	And today, in an unprecedented, unscripted commentary,
15400	20500	we are going to discuss the fallout of the LeafyIsHere YouTube geographic.
20500	27800	So first and foremost, let me just say that I have been completely blown away by the support for this video.
27800	31600	This video must have really titillated Montazon's fancy,
31600	35800	because in less than two weeks it got over a million views.
35800	38800	Now I've had a few videos get to a million views in the past,
38800	42600	but this is the fastest, by far, it's ever happened.
42600	47800	And all the comments, all the messages I got from this video have been overwhelmingly positive.
47800	52600	People really, really seem to like how I put this video together.
52600	58600	I mean really, in the last seven days I've gained over 50,000 subscribers.
58600	65900	And I've never really ever had anything like this happen before in eight years of making videos.
65900	76400	So before I get into anything here, I have to first welcome all 50,000 of the new subscribers to the channel.
76400	81800	Please feel free to make yourself at home, pour yourself a glass of downward spiral.
81800	86600	If you subscribe to me for my editing capabilities,
86600	91100	I regret to inform you that this video will not have any of those,
91100	97300	just because I don't want to spend another two months working on a 40 plus minute video.
97300	102900	In honor of Leafy, this video will feature random gameplay in the background,
102900	107200	as I commentate over it with unrelated commentary.
107200	111100	So now, without further ado, let's get into the discussion.
111100	116400	So first of all, I kind of just want to address the background of this video.
116400	119800	I want to answer why I made this video.
119800	124400	Why, Emp? Why is this video 51 minutes?
124400	130700	Me YouTuber, me no have attention span to watch 51 minute video.
130700	133700	Why video must be 51 minute.
133700	137300	Well, to tell you the truth, the video was originally going to be a lot shorter.
137300	142100	I actually started writing the script for this video way back in November,
142100	144900	after the very first episode of YouTube Geographic.
144900	152600	However, any fans of the channel at that time will know that that was when I started my little mini crusade against YouTube,
152600	155100	and I sort of put the script on the back burner.
155100	159100	But originally, this video was probably going to be like every other generic,
159100	165100	what happened to LeafyIsHere, and in hindsight, I'm glad it didn't turn out that way.
165100	170900	My original inspiration to make the Leafy video came from just browsing on YouTube one day,
170900	173400	and I looked at all the big commentary channels.
173400	177200	I looked at H3H3, iDubbbz, Keemstar.
177200	184500	I kind of just looked at all their stats and their subscribers just to see how much they had grown in the past year.
184500	191000	And then I kind of remembered in the back of my head that Leafy was originally right there in the running with these guys,
191000	197200	and he seemingly completely disappeared off the face of the earth.
197200	202800	Now keep in mind, this was during a time before Leafy had actually stopped making videos,
202800	208100	but I never actually heard a peep from him in the past year or so,
208100	210500	and I was just kind of wondering what happened.
210500	215300	I originally wanted to just explore the topic of Leafy's downfall,
215300	219700	and how he managed to sort of hit rock bottom in terms of growth.
219700	224200	Yeah, but then after I put the script on the back burner, a lot of interesting things started happening.
224200	235300	First of all, the Tower Dog leaks came out, which provided a whole new insight into why Leafy sort of just disappeared from my recommended feed.
235300	242700	And that leak was, of course, about YouTube's covert censorship of certain commentary channels.
242700	249800	And after that, I began to look at the stats. I began to look at the analytics of Leafy's channel a lot more closely.
249800	260700	And that was when I started to notice a lot of really irregular patterns that could not be explained under normal circumstances.
260700	270700	And considering the Tower Dog allegations, it began to make a lot more sense to me that YouTube was tampering with Leafy's numbers,
270700	275200	and suppressing him from being viewed by most of his audience.
275200	285200	And about the same time, I made a lot of videos. I made a series of videos harshly criticizing YouTube and their decision-making and their management.
285200	292000	And something very interesting happened the following January, February, and March.
292000	295900	Looking at my own analytics, I could tell that something was way off.
295900	304000	I've been around long enough on this website where I kind of have an expectation of how certain videos will perform.
304000	308900	And these videos I uploaded during this stretch, and you can go back and watch them.
308900	314900	There's a chance that any of you who've been subscribed over the duration might not have even seen some of them,
314900	321200	because I got tons of reports from fans saying that my videos weren't showing up in the recommended,
321200	324600	and my videos weren't showing up in their subscriptions.
324600	327700	And everything was getting instantly demonetized.
327700	337300	Even if it did not contain one shred of questionable content, they would still get instantly demonetized as I uploaded them.
337300	343700	I remember making a Logan Paul rant about a week after the whole thing happened.
343700	349800	And that video started off getting a ton of views, and then after about a day, it got age-restricted.
349800	358000	And the official reason I got told for that was that they're age-restricting anything that depicts an image of the thumbnail,
358000	367200	which doesn't really make much sense, because I recall seeing a ton of other videos that used the image of the thumbnail and they weren't age-restricted.
367200	374400	So I got really paranoid around this time. I got paranoid that YouTube was sort of suppressing me.
374400	381500	And of course now, obviously, in the light of my recent success with this video, that's clearly no longer the case.
381500	391100	But still though, for a period of about three months, it just seemed like all the numbers on my channel were lower than they should have been.
391100	396800	And that made me very concerned, and it made me very suspicious of YouTube.
396800	401800	And when I first saw the Tower Dog leaks, I was a little bit skeptical.
401800	407400	It just seemed awfully bizarre that YouTube would go after specific channels.
407400	414400	At the time, it didn't really occur to me that they would even care about specific channels.
414400	424100	But after that stretch of three months or so, where I felt like my account was targeted and suppressed by YouTube, I started looking into things a lot more.
424100	430100	And that was about the time when I sort of renewed my interest in making the Leafy video.
430100	438200	Because it began to dawn on me that what if the same thing that allegedly happened to me also happened to Leafy, but a hundred times worse?
438200	445400	So after the Jimmy Kimmel video, I started researching and writing the LeafyWasHere script.
445400	454100	And during my research, I began to unpack all these signs that supported the theory that YouTube suppressed Leafy's channel.
454100	466600	And the more research I did, and the more evidence I found at this theory that YouTube suppressed Leafy's channel, the more I became sure that this was what happened to Leafy.
466600	475100	And as I did more research, and as I dug deeper, I began to realize with confidence that Leafy got screwed.
475100	482100	The dude got absolutely screwed over, and nobody really realizes it except for me.
482100	488100	And you can go on YouTube right now and look at all the other What Happened to Leafy's Here videos, they're all kind of the same.
488100	491800	They all cover the same sort of scope of events.
491800	503600	But what I began to realize is that the story of Leafy goes so much deeper than kind of what's public knowledge, and what's generally presented by the commentary community.
503600	507600	Leafy's disappearance just goes so much deeper than what everyone thinks.
507600	514600	So with this new burden of knowledge, I felt like it was sort of my responsibility to present the whole story.
514600	520600	And to present what I'm fairly certain is the truth of what actually happened to Leafy.
520600	523600	So that's kind of why the video is 51 minutes long.
523600	534600	It's because with the issue of LeafyIsHere, there's simply so much information to unpack, and I felt like I really needed to present that information adequately.
534600	539600	There's simply too much of a story to tell to make the video any shorter.
539600	542600	And thankfully, people really appreciated that effort.
542600	547600	Of course, there were a few people commenting like, oh, 51 minutes, I'm not watching that.
547600	550600	But I actually kind of turned it around on a lot of people.
550600	554600	I saw some people commenting, oh, 51 minutes, that's too long.
554600	560600	And then 51 minutes later, they leave a second comment saying, wow, that was actually pretty good.
560600	567600	So for those of you guys who are patient, just like to stick around, watch the whole thing, I really appreciate it.
567600	579600	And since this video got so much traction and created so much of a discussion, I felt like I was sort of obligated to follow up on it and respond to some unanswered questions that people might have had.
579600	586600	So I took to Twitter and I asked my followers to post any questions they had about the Leafy video.
586600	596600	And I got a ton of responses. I tried to narrow down what I'm covering to sort of a few general questions that a bunch of people were asking.
596600	597600	So let's get into that.
597600	603600	This person wonders what other types of YouTubers I think that the YouTube algorithm has tried to shut down.
603600	613600	And this is a very interesting notion that I'm sure a lot of people inferred after I presented my theory about how YouTube censored Leafy's channel.
614600	620600	If YouTube would go so far as to completely suppress Leafy's videos, what other type of censorship could they be doing?
620600	627600	From what I've seen on YouTube, definitely a lot of political channels, they don't get very many views.
627600	642600	Recently, gun channels, that was something that was actually reported on in the news where YouTube is kind of suppressing gun content now in the wake of the recent school shooting spree in America.
642600	648600	When answering this question, it's kind of hard to tell for sure, but there's certainly patterns that you can observe.
648600	660600	Basically anything YouTube lists in its demonetization guidelines, any channel related to those guidelines, have typically been shown to perform less well.
660600	669600	I believe the YouTube censorship machine extends far and wide, but it covers a different extent depending on what kind of video it is.
669600	673600	It's very interesting what you can observe out there if you keep your eyes open.
673600	681600	Lots of people asked for my thoughts on what Leafy could have done to sort of redeem himself in the eyes of the general public.
681600	687600	Well personally, I think Leafy's downfall boils down to two very critical moments.
687600	691600	The first one was the Tommy NC rant and subsequent backlash.
691600	697600	I think that was the first real moment where a substantial number of people turned against Leafy.
697600	704600	Before that, it was basically just smooth sailing for him, but that was sort of the first crack in his empire.
704600	714600	I think if after the Tommy NC video, Leafy had just sort of stopped roasting individual people, he might very well still be around today.
714600	723600	A lot of people commented on my Leafy video saying that they used to be subscribed to Leafy and they enjoyed his rants and his story time videos,
723600	729600	but they kind of lost interest once he just started becoming primarily a roast channel.
729600	739600	And honestly, I think if he had just gone back to that style of giving personal stories, personal anecdotes, he would have been fine, and he would still be quite popular today.
739600	749600	But anyway, after the Tommy NC video, I think him deciding not to change up his style and just to continue with roasting random people on the internet,
749600	754600	I think that was the point of no return for him because after that point, YouTube got involved.
754600	760600	And once YouTube kind of sort of put the clamp on his channel, he could not really recover.
760600	767600	Now, the second critical point for Leafy was the content cop response.
767600	774600	So if the Tommy NC incident is sort of what caused Leafy's numbers to go down across the board,
774600	781600	the content cop response is what caused him to sort of lose the respect of the majority of the commentary community.
781600	791600	I think had Leafy just sort of owned up to the criticism instead of just responding to it negatively, like he just sort of did with any old YouTuber,
791600	801600	I think if he had shown some humility, some empathy in that situation, I think it's fair to say that he wouldn't have been hated nearly to the extent that he was.
802600	807600	But unfortunately for him, he kind of handled the response to content cop poorly.
807600	809600	And as a result, he got hated.
809600	815600	And an unfortunate side effect of that was that once Leafy's videos started disappearing from everyone's recommended,
815600	822600	no one really cared and no one sought to investigate that further just because of the extent that he was hated.
822600	827600	Several people asked me about the research process of my videos.
827600	836600	Well, the first thing I do when I get an idea, I often casually research the topic months in advance, months before even starting a script.
836600	838600	It's not as difficult as it probably sounds.
838600	847600	It's usually just something I'm curious about and I gradually look deeper and deeper into it, slowly gathering facts.
847600	853600	And what I do is instead of just presenting a bunch of random facts about an incident or a topic,
853600	858600	I really strive to piece together sort of a narrative of what happened.
858600	864600	And then I try to find evidence and screenshots and videos that support that narrative.
864600	870600	For the research process, I spend a ton of time on the Wayback Machine, the web archive.
870600	876600	That's how I got most of the footage and screenshots on the Leafy video.
876600	883600	The web archive is just a tremendous resource for finding information about stuff that happened in the past.
883600	889600	You'd be surprised the amount of information you can find on that website.
889600	897600	And it's very helpful because over time on the internet, a lot of information and truth sort of just gets buried very quickly.
897600	903600	Like for example, going into this video, I had no idea Leafy even made Minecraft videos.
903600	912600	Yet that was a core part of his channel for three years and it's actually somewhat insightful for explaining why Leafy did some of the things he did.
912600	916600	It was because he learned a lot of these traits during the Minecraft era.
916600	920600	But until my video, no one really talked about that.
920600	925600	It was something I had to learn myself going through all the old past screenshots of his channel.
925600	929600	Lots of people asked me about what my thoughts were on grade A under A.
929600	936600	I referenced grade A in the video, but there was never really a point where I discussed anything about him.
936600	944600	For those of you who don't know, grade A under A was another commentary channel that got popular around the same time as Leafy.
944600	947600	And they were actually friends behind the scenes.
948600	956600	And kind of like Leafy, grade A had this very endearing style where he would just sort of openly rant about a bunch of topics.
956600	965600	And his production quality was really poor, but people didn't care just because the way he spoke was so charismatic and captivating.
965600	967600	People just kind of wanted to get behind him.
967600	971600	So what happened to grade was that after 2016, he kind of just stopped making videos.
971600	974600	About a year before Leafy stopped, actually.
974600	978600	And kind of just like Leafy, you don't really hear about anything from him anymore.
978600	987600	I did have a look at his analytics, and interestingly, they show a similar pattern to Leafy's analytics where they suddenly fall off and they just never recover.
987600	995600	And the reason that's so interesting is because grade A was also one of the channels listed in the Tower Dog leak in the YouTube memo.
995600	1001600	It was one of the named channels that YouTube sort of wanted gone from the platform.
1001600	1005600	And so I find it very interesting how he sort of disappeared as well.
1005600	1011600	You could kind of attribute a lot of that to him just not making videos for almost two years now.
1011600	1020600	But still though, it's something to consider how he was also one of the targeted channels in YouTube's alleged suppression effort.
1020600	1024600	And how he, just like Leafy, is not around anymore.
1024600	1028600	I probably won't do a YouTube geographic on grade A.
1028600	1037600	Kind of just because much of the content of that hypothetical video would pretty much already have been covered in the Leafy video.
1037600	1043600	But it's still an interesting topic nonetheless, and I suggest other people look into that.
1043600	1046600	Phoenix Haggard asks if the project was fun.
1046600	1052600	Well, I don't know if fun is the right word, but I did enjoy making the project.
1052600	1059600	I really enjoyed the aspects of sort of piecing together a story that no one really knows yet.
1059600	1069600	And just having the dramatic irony knowing that once I upload this video, it's kind of going to change the way people think about this certain issue.
1069600	1073600	So that was very important in motivating me to finish this.
1073600	1080600	The whole effort of the video from writing to editing probably took me over 40 days of work.
1080600	1083600	And the video did end up running very long.
1083600	1090600	There are certain points during editing where it does get very tedious and you kind of just want it to be over.
1090600	1097600	But like I said, the idea of sort of changing people's minds about an issue is highly motivating.
1097600	1103600	And it made me very excited to finish this video and put it up online for everyone to see.
1103600	1108600	A few people wanted to know if I think Leafy will ever come back to YouTube.
1108600	1111600	And personally, I think he'll be back.
1111600	1121600	Partially for reasons that I'll get into later, but mostly because YouTube is just such a magnet of attention right now.
1121600	1128600	It's pretty difficult to go anywhere on the internet and escape YouTube's pull.
1128600	1132600	I'm pretty sure that Leafy, wherever he is, still uses the internet.
1132600	1136600	He most likely does not live like an Amish person.
1136600	1143600	And I think it's fair to say that he probably anonymously watches YouTube every now and then.
1143600	1148600	I honestly just think he got burnt out from all the hate and he's taking a break.
1148600	1152600	And I'm fairly confident that one day he will return.
1152600	1159600	This person asks me sort of what I've learned from the whole experience of researching and producing this video.
1159600	1167600	And if Leafy had learned anything, well first of all for me, I definitely fear YouTube a lot more now.
1167600	1174600	Because I'm fairly certain that they blackballed Leafy out of existence on the platform.
1174600	1178600	And if they can do that, they can do the same to me or you.
1178600	1183600	So I had always suspected that YouTube was corrupt to an extent.
1183600	1188600	But researching this video really put that whole notion in a whole new light.
1188600	1194600	Where this is an actual tangible event that YouTube has done to a person.
1194600	1200600	Also while making this video, I learned that sort of the YouTube process, the YouTube game,
1200600	1204600	it can really have some negative effects on people.
1204600	1208600	A lot of people think that being a YouTuber is just the easiest thing in the world.
1208600	1212600	And you just upload gaming videos and you basically print money.
1212600	1218600	But this whole Leafy thing made me realize a very dark side of YouTube.
1218600	1226600	Where the whole YouTube process, all the fame, all the fans, it can really mess with someone's psychology and mental health.
1226600	1229600	And Leafy is a tragic case of that.
1229600	1234600	And this was one of the themes I tried to portray in the video with the whole shining motif.
1234600	1237600	YouTube began to control Leafy, not the other way around.
1237600	1246600	Leafy just became so obsessed with getting views and subscribers that he sort of lost sight of a lot of stuff that made him human.
1246600	1248600	And that's very dark to say.
1248600	1254600	But if you look at the whole story of Leafy, he started out as just a kid playing Minecraft and having fun with friends.
1254600	1260600	And slowly but surely, YouTube fame kind of poisoned him and poisoned his mind.
1260600	1264600	And turned him into sort of this mini tyrannical dictator.
1264600	1272600	And it's very sad how YouTube and fame can do that to otherwise decent people.
1272600	1275600	Now do I think Leafy learned something? Probably.
1275600	1283600	I think the fact that he quit at all and just stopped making videos may be a sign that he finally realized his wrongdoings.
1283600	1288600	He finally realized the extent to which he was hated and the damage that he had done.
1288600	1293600	And if Leafy returns, he might see a completely changed man.
1293600	1296600	And hopefully he will have learned from his mistakes.
1302600	1306600	So here's the big popular YouTuber collusion bonus round.
1306600	1308600	Mumkey Jones asks,
1308600	1311600	When will you make a Mumkey documentary?
1311600	1316600	Well, Mumkey, if you're talking about the crossover video we did, the answer to that is a few days ago.
1316600	1321600	So if you guys want to watch me narrate a Mumkey Jones documentary, check out the video on Mumkey's channel.
1321600	1323600	Link in the description.
1323600	1332600	If you're asking about the Mumkey Jones YouTube geographic, I'm afraid I can't do one on you yet because you haven't gone on the downward spiral.
1332600	1335600	You see, YouTube empires are interesting.
1335600	1340600	But YouTube empires that go on a downward spiral, that's YouTube geographic worthy.
1340600	1345600	I don't know, Mumkey. All I see when I look at your channel is your numbers are going up.
1345600	1348600	You're raking in the fans.
1348600	1350600	You're just too successful right now.
1350600	1354600	And I'm afraid I can't produce a Leafy-style documentary on you yet.
1354600	1356600	Internet Historian asks,
1356600	1358600	What was the file size of the video?
1358600	1362600	And the answer to that is 4.56 gigabytes.
1362600	1367600	Yeah, the 51-minute 1080p videos will do that to you.
1367600	1376600	Turkey Tom brings up an interesting hypothetical if I would rather have a situation where Leafy never lost popularity.
1376600	1387600	And it's kind of a difficult question to answer because it's really hard to tell what would have happened if Leafy had never fallen off his throne on the commentary community.
1387600	1397600	I definitely think that if Leafy had not lost popularity, he would probably be somewhere around the 8 to 10 million subscriber range by now.
1397600	1403600	And it would be very interesting to see him go toe-to-toe with channels like Logan Paul and RiceGum.
1403600	1410600	But at the same time, what kind of effect would that have on sort of the toxicity of his community?
1410600	1418600	If you took the height of Leafy's empire and doubled that, how much of a problem would that make for sort of the YouTube community as a whole?
1418600	1424600	Would Leafy even be able to achieve those numbers continuing to roast people?
1424600	1432600	Or was his decline kind of inevitable because YouTube viewed him as such a threat to the well-being of the website?
1432600	1439600	You have to kind of consider all of those factors when considering the hypothetical of Leafy still being popular today.
1439600	1447600	As for the current status quo in sort of the commentary sphere of YouTube, it's pretty stagnant as far as I can tell.
1447600	1453600	Where Leafy died, he kind of gave rise to about half a dozen Leafy clones.
1453600	1459600	I'm not going to name any names, but you guys probably know who I'm talking about.
1459600	1465600	All of them are kind of the same, very little distinction between any of those channels.
1465600	1469600	They all have around the same subscribers, they make videos on the same topics.
1469600	1478600	And as a result, they kind of took Leafy's old audience and split them several ways, so none of them really stand out that much.
1478600	1487600	And the relevancy of all these commentary channels have sort of been dwarfed by the kind of status quo, prototypical YouTube vlog channels.
1487600	1497600	It's hard to say that any of them really have hardly as much clout as what Leafy once possessed in throwing his weight around on YouTube.
1497600	1503600	So I guess in summary to answer this question, I would sort of lean towards preferring how things are now,
1503600	1508600	just because I felt that Leafy's decline was kind of inevitable anyway.
1508600	1513600	And the decline of Leafy kind of ushered in an entirely new era of YouTube.
1513600	1518600	I think the idea of Leafy sticking around and staying popular would have only delayed the inevitable.
1518600	1523600	This guy kind of wants to know my thoughts on YouTube's sort of abuse of power,
1523600	1530600	and how they can sort of wave a magic wand, pull some strings behind the scenes, and decide if a channel lives or dies.
1530600	1533600	I certainly think it's concerning, to say the least.
1533600	1538600	I remember a time when YouTube was pretty impartial with these kinds of things,
1538600	1549600	but you keep hearing reports time and time again that they seem to really want to limit and kind of throttle content that doesn't really fit the prototypical YouTube mold.
1549600	1555600	In the past few years at least, there's been a very heavy emphasis on preserving family-friendly content,
1555600	1562600	and pretty much anything that deals with mature subject matter gets kind of throttled and blocked.
1562600	1568600	And I guess my biggest concern over how YouTube sort of operates their business model now,
1568600	1577600	is that the entire website of YouTube will get stuck with this reputation of being just a kiddie kid website,
1577600	1580600	where the only stuff on there is stuff for children.
1580600	1586600	And you'll start to see a mass exodus of adult content consumers on YouTube.
1586600	1593600	It's never really a good look, and it's never really sustainable for anything to kind of become labeled as a kid's thing.
1593600	1603600	Another consequence I want to point out is sort of how in systematically eliminating the more bizarre, the more obscure, the more edgy content creators on YouTube,
1603600	1612600	YouTube is forming a situation where the vast, vast, vast majority of content is incredibly saturated and incredibly similar.
1612600	1621600	And I feel like in the last several years on YouTube there's been a very big sort of de-emphasis on actually putting effort and substance into your content.
1621600	1630600	It's all about just hitting that 10 minute threshold and putting enough little bells and whistles in your videos just to keep your viewers' attention for long enough,
1630600	1635600	and just giving them something to play in a tab while they're doing something else.
1635600	1642600	Rather than actually making interesting, dynamic, complex content that demands your viewers' attention.
1642600	1651600	So yeah, those are the main consequences that could seriously jeopardize the future of YouTube based on how they're running the website today.
1651600	1660600	Trent brings up a very interesting point, where based on my theory, if YouTube thought Leafy was such a big problem and set such a bad example for YouTube,
1660600	1672600	why don't they go after the entire sphere of douche YouTubers whose ridiculous antics set really bad examples for the impressionable youth watching their videos?
1672600	1676600	And that's a very good question. It's a question I ask myself a lot.
1676600	1684600	If I could give any theory as to why this is the case, I would probably relate it back to the little motif in my Leafy video,
1684600	1690600	where I talk about the really rich, successful YouTuber with a Lamborghini in his mansion.
1690600	1699600	You see, you have to ask yourself how YouTube as a business can continue to entice new people to produce content for them.
1699600	1706600	And I think what they do is they promote rich, successful looking people from Hollywood to the top of the website,
1706600	1722600	So every new viewer who watches YouTube, most of the content they watch will be from a really wealthy, attractive, vlogger-type person who lives in a mansion and has an expensive, exotic car and sleeps with a supermodel every night.
1722600	1732600	And through enough repetition of this, new viewers will begin to associate YouTubers with an opulent, wealthy, celebrity lifestyle.
1732600	1736600	And they'll use that image as motivation to produce content.
1736600	1744600	You see, the way I look at YouTube is that you have to understand that everything they do has an official meaning and then it has an actual meaning.
1744600	1751600	Like, for example, watch time. YouTube has placed so much emphasis on watch time over the past five years.
1751600	1755600	The official explanation for the incredible emphasis on watch time is,
1755600	1763600	Well, we want YouTubers to make higher quality content, and if people are watching the videos for longer, that must mean the content is higher quality.
1763600	1768600	That's what they tell you, but in reality, we can clearly observe that that's not the case.
1768600	1781600	On average, content on YouTube has become a lot more watered down, a lot more bland, a lot more boring, and much less likely to keep your attention than it was back when they had a ten minute maximum on videos.
1781600	1785600	You see, the truth of why YouTube mandates that you increase watch time is,
1785600	1790600	One, advertisers pay a higher rate for longer videos, and that makes them more money.
1790600	1799600	And two, the longer you make people watch YouTube videos, the less time they spend on a competitor site like Facebook or Amazon.
1799600	1804600	So YouTube has sort of a double meaning for every action they do.
1804600	1813600	And you can kind of apply that theory to taking down Leafy. Of course, they never admit to it, but it's pretty clear from what I've researched that they did it.
1813600	1819600	And I'm sure if they ever came out and talked about it, the official explanation would be something along the lines of,
1819600	1829600	Oh, he violated the guidelines, he incited cyberbullying, he harassed children. They come up with a long official laundry list like that.
1829600	1837600	But realistically, if you want to put a tinfoil hat on your tinfoil hat, I think that they might have gotten rid of him because he didn't fit the YouTuber brand.
1837600	1848600	He didn't look like one of those attractive blonde Hollywood vloggers, and he was actually quite outspoken about several issues rather than being really vapid and innocuous.
1848600	1859600	And they kind of viewed his whole image and sort of his whole incitement of rebellion as really unstable for the whole YouTube image.
1859600	1864600	That's the best I can do to explain why YouTube systematically got rid of Leafy.
1864600	1871600	While they let really douchey vloggers who are really guilty of many of the same things that Leafy was guilty of,
1871600	1877600	they let them just run completely roughshod and connect to however many young impressionable fans they want.
1877600	1881600	So that's an interesting little game you can play whenever YouTube says they're doing something.
1881600	1886600	Try to find the ulterior motive that's different from the official explanation.
1886600	1895600	This guy brings up an interesting dilemma where the act of roasting popular YouTubers actually feeds into the popularity even more.
1895600	1897600	And I kind of agree with that sentiment.
1897600	1902600	An example I bring up is the Logan Paul KSI boxing match.
1902600	1907600	Logan or Jake Paul, I forget which everyone's fighting him, but here's a boxing match that's happening.
1907600	1917600	And if you seriously think that they're doing this genuinely to settle beef, then you're probably a child who watches one of them
1917600	1925600	because it's very clear that this is just a massive marketing opportunity to stimulate interest for both parties.
1925600	1936600	It's just sort of a corporate, artificial feud that kind of preys on people's hunger for drama and exploits people for attention.
1936600	1944600	It's part of the reason why I kind of miss 2016 because a lot of that beef in 2016 was actually legitimate and not staged.
1944600	1954600	But to go back to the general question, yeah, by and large, most conflict and drama on YouTube literally only serves to help both channels that are involved.
1954600	1962600	The worst case scenario in a situation like this is that you get a ton of haters, but they still watch your videos anyway
1962600	1966600	and they still give you revenue just because they want to see you respond to the drama.
1966600	1976600	And it's not just YouTube. You see stuff like this show up all over the place in entertainment where by and large it's better to be hated than to be irrelevant.
1976600	1985600	And this guy brings up another interesting point where he talks about how in sort of a continuation of the demonetization system,
1985600	1990600	YouTube sort of made PewDiePie out to be the scapegoat for the whole thing.
1990600	1993600	And I think on YouTube's end, they definitely succeeded.
1993600	2000600	If you ask most people online, they would tell you that demonetization began after the whole PewDiePie racism controversy.
2000600	2004600	And that's what most of the news articles about it report, but it's not actually true.
2004600	2015600	YouTube's demonetization began back in August 2016, coincidentally a few months after YouTube's alleged secret meeting where they wanted to get rid of certain creators.
2015600	2020600	So yeah, demonetization actually began six months before most people think it did.
2020600	2026600	And I definitely think there was some scapegoating on YouTube's end at PewDiePie's expense.
2026600	2034600	Come to think of it, PewDiePie has kind of become the go-to scapegoat for YouTube controversy lately, and it's kind of a shame.
2034600	2038600	I don't think he deserves most of the criticism he gets from the media.
2038600	2046600	The notion that PewDiePie started the demonetization system is certainly a prevailing misconception in mainstream society.
2046600	2055600	And it's a shame because if people really looked into the issue, they'd see it extends far further than just a small racism controversy.
2055600	2062600	And the final sort of question I want to discuss in this video is, lots of people asked me, where do I think Leafy is now?
2062600	2069600	And to be perfectly honest, I have no idea where Leafy is now, and I'm pretty sure no one really does.
2069600	2077600	Outside of his close circle of real-life friends, I was not able to get in contact with Leafy.
2077600	2083600	However, I was able to get in contact with YouTube's favorite clown, Colossal's Crazy.
2083600	2094600	Colossal actually reached out to me after viewing my video, and for those of you who aren't aware, Colossal's Crazy was one of Leafy's few true friends in the commentary community from back in the day.
2094600	2102600	He sent me some messages that offer a lot of insight regarding Leafy's mindset and attitude with regards to YouTube.
2102600	2106600	And with his permission, I'm going to share some of those messages with you right now.
2106600	2110600	I haven't spoken to him in over six months, but we used to speak every day.
2110600	2114600	He's totally disappeared from the internet, can't even get a hold of him on Skype.
2114600	2118600	He even forgot the password to the email that accessed his Twitter.
2118600	2121600	It's kind of sad because we used to get on really well and speak all the time.
2121600	2128600	Don't blame him though, YouTube fucked him over, and after that, all he was left with was a bunch of mindless sheep hating him,
2128600	2133600	and having videos made on him by many commentators who are guilty of everything he was doing.
2133600	2136600	The commentary community is riddled with hypocrites, honestly.
2136600	2140600	He was definitely a bit of a sociopath, not like full-blown, but a bit.
2140600	2146600	He was borderline obsessed with YouTube, it became a real ego thing for him, it was pretty much all he had.
2146600	2152600	This dude was a multi-millionaire, but he spent less than someone on minimum wage would spend in a year.
2152600	2156600	That's how deep he was into YouTube, pretty much never left his room and ate cheap packet noodles.
2156600	2161600	He actually hated making videos, had no passion for the creative process whatsoever.
2161600	2164600	He didn't like his own fans or interacting with them.
2164600	2167600	He hated all other YouTubers and, quite rightly, didn't trust them.
2167600	2170600	After a while, he didn't even care about the money.
2170600	2174600	It was literally just a number to him at that point, and he didn't even know what to spend it on.
2174600	2178600	Just seeing millions of views and the subscriber gains, that's the kind of stuff he got off on.
2178600	2183600	I personally never understood it, but I guess everyone has different drives and motivations.
2183600	2187600	So when YouTube fucked him, he had literally no reason to continue.
2187600	2190600	He knew that no matter what he did, he was fucked forever.
2190600	2193600	Even if he changed up his content, he was fucked.
2193600	2196600	Maybe if he was encouraged more to continue, he'd still be around.
2196600	2199600	But of course, the LeafyHate train was in full steam.
2199600	2203600	If he came back to YouTube today, he'd probably be a very different person.
2203600	2207600	That said, he did some altogether pretty fucked up things in the time I knew him.
2207600	2211600	Even as his friend, sometimes it was hard to feel sorry for him when things backfired.
2211600	2213600	He never deserved what happened though.
2213600	2216600	He's actually really intelligent, believe it or not.
2216600	2218600	He just had no life experience.
2218600	2222600	Not even because of his age, but because everything he understood came from the internet.
2222600	2225600	When I first met him, he was still living with his mother.
2225600	2227600	He didn't know how to deal with basic problems,
2227600	2231600	and despite the fact that he'd always ask for advice, he'd rarely ever take it.
2231600	2235600	I see a ton of commentators now saying, bring back Leafy or I miss Leafy.
2235600	2239600	Nine times out of ten, they're saying that because they finally realized that,
2239600	2243600	actually, them and their mates are doing the same thing he was doing.
2243600	2248600	In all my time on YouTube, I've never seen such an insane case of bandwagoning.
2248600	2250600	Even with Keemstar, it wasn't as bad.
2250600	2252600	And that was fucking bad.
2252600	2255600	I have no respect for the majority of the viewers in this community.
2255600	2257600	They are led by the nose wherever they go.
2257600	2261600	For the majority of viewers in the drama slash commentary community,
2261600	2264600	they don't actually have the first clue of what good content is.
2264600	2269600	They physically need someone to tell them what is and what isn't good content,
2269600	2273600	and who is and who isn't someone worth watching, based on that and who they are.
2273600	2275600	I defended him a fair bit on the Baited podcast.
2275600	2278600	Maybe six to seven episodes, I can't remember.
2278600	2283600	100% your typical commentator didn't want to defend Leafy at all for the reasons you mentioned.
2283600	2286600	For me, I never considered making a video or anything.
2286600	2288600	I don't think I'd ever really make a video like that.
2288600	2292600	I definitely got a lot of hate for even associating with Leafy.
2292600	2295600	Nowhere near as much for associating with Keem, to be sure,
2295600	2297600	but that's honestly never really put me off.
2297600	2299600	Obviously, Keem had his own beef with Leafy.
2299600	2304600	Grade supported Leafy behind the scenes, and Pyrocynical wasn't really that good friends with Leafy.
2304600	2309600	Leafy was only friends with three people, Keemstar, Grade, and myself.
2309600	2312600	Everyone either disliked him or were fairly neutral with him.
2312600	2317600	So yeah, definitely the main reason people didn't defend him was because of the bandwagon.
2317600	2319600	It was the unpopular opinion.
2319600	2322600	There were some things he did that were completely indefensible, of course,
2322600	2326600	but much of the hate coming from other YouTubers was hypocritical, to say the least.
2326600	2329600	I definitely was Leafy's biggest offender way back when.
2329600	2332600	Did I do enough as a friend? That's a good question, I suppose.
2332600	2334600	But I'd say yes, otherwise I'd have done more.
2334600	2339600	When it comes down to it, in my eyes, Leafy was guilty and deserved criticism for the following.
2339600	2345600	Low quality content, making videos on children, his videos on Keemstar, what he did to Nick Cash.
2345600	2348600	A few other minor things maybe, but that's pretty much it.
2348600	2353600	As far as the clickbait goes, who cares? 99% of YouTubers seem to be doing that.
2353600	2357600	The video stretching? Again, so many of his peers seem to be doing that.
2357600	2359600	The social ineptitude? Welcome to YouTube.
2359600	2361600	What else was there, really?
2361600	2365600	Far and beyond his biggest fuck-ups from my perspective were everything he was doing to children.
2365600	2367600	That was just completely indefensible.
2367600	2372600	Everything paled in comparison to that, but it's often been far from his biggest criticism.
2372600	2376600	When you measure what he's done to what others do today, the hate was never warranted.
2376600	2382600	I see what others are doing, some of which are also friends of mine, and it's either the same thing or worse.
2382600	2387600	People have this idea in their head that Leafy is this fucking evil bastard.
2387600	2395600	That's just not the case, and these exact same people seem to have no problem with another YouTuber when he does the exact same thing.
2395600	2402600	It's a mob mentality that's absolutely stereotypical with the average content consumer in this particular genre."
2402600	2407600	So it would seem that Colossal had a lot to say on Leafy's behalf.
2407600	2415600	It's clear that he certainly resented the commentary community a lot for what they did to Leafy following the Content Cop.
2415600	2421600	I find it very interesting that he sort of reaffirmed many of the theories I brought up in my Leafy video.
2421600	2429600	Most importantly, according to Colossal, he and Leafy both had a strong belief that YouTube was deliberately suppressing Leafy's content.
2429600	2435600	I also found it very interesting what Colossal said about the psychology behind Leafy.
2435600	2441600	You know, in my video about Leafy, I included the motif of The Shining as sort of a metaphorical device.
2441600	2446600	However, according to what Colossal said, it might have turned out to be not too far from reality,
2446600	2451600	where apparently Leafy became legitimately obsessed with the idea of YouTube fame,
2451600	2457600	and just like I said in my video, his subscriber count quite literally began to control him.
2457600	2467600	So ultimately, although Colossal's testimony was very insightful, it doesn't really answer the question as to what Leafy is up to now.
2467600	2474600	And originally, this was going to be the end of the video. Just a very unsatisfying, mostly unresolved ending.
2474600	2486600	However, as I was editing this project, another member of the original Baited podcast, Tommy C, messaged me and came forward with his own information about Leafy.
2486600	2494600	He actually informed me that Leafy contacted him very recently, after a period of not hearing from him for over six months.
2494600	2500600	So based on that, I decided to ask Tommy a series of questions related to Leafy, and this is what he had to say.
2500600	2504600	When was the last time that you had contact with Leafy?
2504600	2511600	Well, up until the other day, I hadn't had contact with Leafy since early 2018,
2511600	2515600	and that conversation consisted of, let Billy the fridge and clown know you're okay.
2515600	2523600	It was kind of a shock to hear from him, because I had been convinced that he was probably gone for good at that point.
2523600	2529600	You know, it's funny with me and Leafy, or Leafy and I I should say, I didn't know exactly how he felt about me,
2529600	2535600	and when he had some of his personal photos leaked, he switched a lot of his Skype around,
2535600	2541600	and he made sure that the changes that he made, that I was aware of all of them, so I could continue to contact him.
2541600	2548600	So I'm pretty sure that while we're not the closest of friends by any stretch, that we generally enjoy our conversations.
2548600	2553600	How would you describe your relationship with Leafy? Would you consider yourself friends?
2553600	2558600	Well, to put it, if Leafy asked me to help him out with something, I certainly would do it.
2558600	2563600	Again, we're not the closest of friends. I would consider us internet friends.
2563600	2571600	We've had several well over an hour conversations. I find him to be fascinating on his take of the world.
2571600	2575600	He's exceptionally bright, very quick, and hungry for knowledge.
2575600	2580600	And I don't say that to sort of pump sunshine up his ass. That's generally who he is.
2580600	2584600	He generally enjoys engaging conversations.
2584600	2589600	But to sum it up, yeah, I think me and Leafy are internet friends. I don't know if it goes much farther than that.
2589600	2596600	I would imagine him and Grade and Billy and Colossal's crazy. I think they would consider themselves friends.
2596600	2599600	I'm more of a guy that he likes to chat with once in a while, to be fair.
2599600	2603600	Summarize what Leafy told you with regard to his decline.
2603600	2609600	I can't say we had too many conversations about this, because it would have been an uncomfortable topic.
2609600	2612600	It's not something I would have brought up. I mean, I know what it's like to decline.
2612600	2616600	I know what it's like to be minus on Social Blade. It's not something we would talk about.
2616600	2623600	We'd probably more talk about esports. We got a big conversation about Quake one time, which we're both fans of.
2623600	2634600	But he did seem to suggest something that you put in your video, that he was somewhat suspicious about YouTube hiding his channel.
2634600	2639600	Or doing something to his channel to make it less available based on some of the statistics that he saw.
2639600	2645600	But he was honest with the fact that he wasn't quite sure how they were doing it.
2645600	2650600	And then amusingly, he said, although I do think he was being very literal.
2650600	2655600	Amusingly, he said that if I were them, I would block me or I would hide.
2655600	2661600	What he actually said was, if I were them, I would get rid of me too.
2661600	2666600	Which I thought was really amusing, but I think he meant it quite literally from a business perspective.
2666600	2671600	In other words, if he owned YouTube, he would not have somebody like him on the platform.
2671600	2676600	After personally speaking with Leafy, what are your impressions on Overhaul's attitude and mental state?
2676600	2680600	Was there more to him than what showed on YouTube?
2680600	2685600	Absolutely. Well, I could say without a shadow of a doubt.
2685600	2687600	I know a lot of people are worried about Leafy.
2687600	2690600	And obviously it would be the way he just kind of ghosted.
2690600	2693600	He ghosted a lot of his friends and really didn't let them know what was going on.
2694600	2701600	But I can say without any reservation whatsoever that Leafy is more than mentally healthy, happy.
2701600	2706600	He is irritated about what YouTube has become.
2706600	2711600	But he kind of hinted that there's been other endeavors outside of YouTube.
2711600	2718600	He told me, I mean he said I could be 100% honest, that he was quite wealthy prior to his explosion on YouTube.
2718600	2722600	I don't think that his mental state is anything to be concerned about.
2722600	2728600	I think Leafy is quite happy with his girlfriend and quite happy with his life.
2728600	2733600	His attitude overall, again, he's upset about the changes in YouTube.
2733600	2734600	Like most of us are.
2734600	2737600	But I think it sickens him more than it does me.
2737600	2739600	He was there in the golden age.
2739600	2742600	And he expressed frustrations like I don't even know how you do it anymore because...
2742600	2747600	In fact, he expressed embarrassment about the criticisms that he made of YouTube in 2015 and 2016.
2747600	2751600	And looking at YouTube now, and it almost seems like there were ridiculous criticisms
2751600	2754600	because it's so much more difficult to make a living.
2754600	2759600	And he is really aware that there would be no Leafy in 2018.
2759600	2760600	Or 17 for that matter.
2760600	2763600	He's irritated about the state of YouTube.
2763600	2765600	It's not what it was.
2765600	2767600	He had problems with YouTube back in the day.
2767600	2772600	But he's kind of looked back at that and seen like, wow, it was a much better place back then.
2772600	2775600	And I think we all agree on that.
2775600	2782600	Do I personally agree with the theory that YouTube intentionally sabotaged Leafy's channel?
2782600	2786600	Look, when it was first suggested to me, and I actually can remember the date.
2786600	2790600	It was about February 2017 when it was first suggested to me.
2790600	2793600	But like I said before, it was kind of in a casual way.
2793600	2795600	But I do think Leafy was being literal about it.
2795600	2798600	After watching your video, I'm getting there.
2798600	2800600	But I'm not 100% sure.
2800600	2803600	Yeah, but I'm getting there and I do believe Leafy believes that.
2803600	2808600	But would I be shocked if your video and Leafy's theory was 100% on?
2808600	2810600	No, not at all.
2810600	2815600	Especially with what I've seen with my own videos and own podcasts.
2815600	2817600	And now that everything's being...
2817600	2819600	I don't even think there's an algorithm anymore.
2819600	2821600	I think there's just automatic demonetization.
2821600	2822600	I'm getting there.
2822600	2824600	There's certainly something to it.
2824600	2827600	How did I react to the Leafy content cop?
2827600	2829600	Did you ever consider defending him?
2829600	2831600	No, not at all.
2831600	2834600	Although I've changed dramatically in my views of YouTube
2834600	2836600	and the way I conduct myself.
2836600	2838600	When I was invited on the Baited podcast from Keem,
2838600	2840600	Keem was my guy.
2840600	2843600	I was going to get this horrible person that I never met.
2843600	2846600	I'm going to get him back. I'm going to get him off the platform.
2846600	2847600	I'm going to embarrass him.
2847600	2849600	I'm going to fuck him up with my own podcast.
2849600	2852600	Some of my biggest podcasts had Leafy in the title,
2852600	2854600	where I was heavily critical of him.
2854600	2857600	When the content cop came out, I laughed ridiculously.
2857600	2859600	I still think it's the best one as far as entertainment perspective.
2859600	2861600	That's just my personal opinion.
2861600	2866600	But I was a very different YouTuber, for lack of a better word, back then.
2866600	2870600	And I was consumed in an environment of revenge,
2870600	2872600	revenge that wasn't even mine to take.
2872600	2876600	But I viewed Keemstar as a victim, and in some ways he was,
2876600	2880600	and somebody that gave me a little glimpse of internet fame.
2880600	2885600	And I was going to do absolutely everything in my power to damage Leafy.
2885600	2887600	I don't feel that way anymore.
2887600	2890600	I've since learned that you have to produce content
2890600	2893600	other than revenge content or drama content.
2893600	2894600	People will leave you.
2894600	2896600	If that's all you have to offer the world,
2896600	2898600	then it's just like you're just an angry dude.
2898600	2900600	And I think I've succeeded in that, and I've turned things around a lot.
2900600	2902600	But it was sort of a hard lesson to learn.
2902600	2904600	And I remember I was talking to Leafy,
2904600	2908600	and he was talking about somebody who had made a criticism of him.
2908600	2910600	I usually call this the teenage girl defense.
2910600	2911600	You don't even know me.
2911600	2913600	It does irritate him, and he's right about this,
2913600	2917600	that you can sort of psychoanalyze somebody on YouTube,
2917600	2919600	never front of them, never talk to them,
2919600	2922600	and never really do any other research
2922600	2924600	than what's already available on the internet,
2924600	2929600	and come with these sort of scathing character summaries,
2929600	2931600	sort of analyze a person in a way
2931600	2935600	where you sort of are projecting that you know who they are.
2935600	2936600	And I think that's right.
2936600	2939600	Meeting Leafy for the first time, it was a strange thing
2939600	2941600	because I was so bred to hate his guts.
2941600	2945600	And he first approached me prior to the Baited podcast breaking up.
2945600	2947600	I was very charmed by him.
2947600	2949600	I found him interesting, intelligent,
2949600	2953600	not to mention the fact that he was one of the more powerful YouTubers at that time.
2953600	2956600	It was sort of just after the Nick Cash thing,
2956600	2960600	and it wasn't quite assured that this was his downfall at this point.
2960600	2964600	You know, this is the guy that was in some days out averaging PewDiePie on subs.
2964600	2966600	Yeah, it was overwhelming.
2966600	2968600	And even after he started to dip,
2968600	2972600	I still saw him as a fascinating character
2972600	2974600	and a fascinating personality.
2974600	2975600	I still do.
2975600	2977600	He is extremely charming,
2977600	2979600	extremely intelligent,
2979600	2981600	and extremely interesting.
2981600	2983600	Going back to what you said before that,
2983600	2985600	I don't think I properly answered,
2985600	2987600	is he different than what he shows on YouTube?
2987600	2988600	Absolutely.
2988600	2991600	I think he's a person with a hell of a lot of depth,
2991600	2993600	despite the fact that he never went to college
2993600	2995600	and grew up rather poor.
2995600	3000600	Do you think that Leafy deserved all the hate and punishment he received?
3000600	3002600	No, looking back,
3002600	3005600	but I wouldn't have said that back then.
3005600	3006600	I do believe,
3006600	3007600	and by the way, Leafy agrees with this well,
3007600	3011600	that he put himself in a position to receive this kind of hate.
3011600	3012600	We both agree on that.
3012600	3014600	The videos that he made on kids,
3014600	3016600	I could never, ever, ever support them in any manner.
3016600	3018600	I still find them disgusting to this day
3018600	3021600	that he would pick random children and just kind of like goof on them.
3021600	3023600	I mean, of course, we all make cringey videos when we're kids.
3023600	3025600	Now there's this whole social media outlet.
3025600	3027600	You know, you just don't do it on your camcorder anymore
3027600	3028600	like you did when I was a kid.
3028600	3030600	It's for the whole world to see.
3030600	3031600	But that being said,
3031600	3033600	it was just so funny after the Content Cop.
3033600	3038600	And then I don't even think the Content Cop was as damaging as the Nick Cash reveal.
3038600	3041600	I think that was the final nail in the coffin, not the Content Cop.
3041600	3044600	The Content Cop gave permission for everybody to sort of come out
3044600	3047600	and say how Leafy had treated him in the past.
3047600	3048600	And then if you also remember,
3048600	3051600	after Nick Cash came out, there was a whole slew of other stuff.
3051600	3054600	Once the seal was broken or the floodgates were open, the flood came in.
3054600	3057600	No, I don't even think all the criticisms were right on.
3057600	3059600	And the thing is, you liked Leafy so much.
3059600	3060600	You were willing to work with Leafy.
3060600	3062600	You were willing to do all this stuff
3062600	3065600	and willing to look the other way when he did make questionable things.
3065600	3067600	And now all of a sudden, he's the worst guy in the world.
3067600	3069600	And Keemstar's a good guy?
3069600	3073600	No, I think it's like most situations on YouTube.
3073600	3075600	Everybody snaked each other.
3075600	3078600	And I don't know if anybody's any worse than any character.
3078600	3080600	And you could throw me in this pile as well.
3080600	3083600	I've had to kind of soul search a bit for my role in this.
3083600	3085600	I think we were all a bunch of rats and snakes,
3085600	3088600	thinking of ourselves, thinking about doing each other,
3088600	3094600	only thinking of fame and more internet fame and boosting our profiles.
3094600	3097600	And I'm for one glad that I kind of got out of that way of thinking
3097600	3099600	for my own sanity.
3099600	3102600	But no, I think nobody deserves all the hate they get.
3102600	3104600	Leafy's a human being.
3104600	3106600	He deserved what he got.
3106600	3108600	But you could always point to a few examples
3108600	3110600	where it's just way over the top.
3110600	3112600	What do you think that Leafy's doing now?
3112600	3114600	Do you think he will return to YouTube?
3114600	3118600	And if so, do you think he will ever overcome the hate?
3118600	3120600	What do you think Leafy is doing now?
3120600	3122600	Well, he did give me permission to speak frankly.
3122600	3126600	I can tell you that he's working, not in a fast food joint.
3126600	3130600	He's still very much the entrepreneur that I met in 2016.
3130600	3132600	Will he return to YouTube?
3132600	3137600	Well, I can tell you that he has floated the idea of making content again.
3137600	3139600	And more of the sense that he'd try it,
3139600	3141600	but he is very irritated by the state of YouTube.
3141600	3143600	It's just simply not fun for him anymore.
3143600	3145600	You've got to understand with Leafy,
3145600	3147600	and I think that's why he put himself in a bad situation.
3147600	3149600	He's a gamer, a hardcore gamer.
3149600	3152600	Can you say that anymore? Does that make me sound old?
3152600	3155600	No, he loves gaming. He loves eSports.
3155600	3157600	He really is passionate about eSports.
3157600	3160600	So that passion that he had for YouTube
3160600	3163600	was probably the same for eSports as far as producing content,
3163600	3166600	but I don't think it's the same passion that me and you have.
3166600	3168600	Making the perfect video.
3168600	3170600	I mean, if you ever played Pac-Man,
3170600	3173600	the only word to determine the better player is who has the most points.
3173600	3175600	And for him, hits were the most points.
3175600	3178600	And I don't think that he finds that very interesting anymore.
3178600	3182600	Not because... I don't necessarily think because it's great.
3182600	3185600	And I think a lot of his closest friends would disagree with me on this.
3185600	3188600	I think it's because he enjoys the game so much.
3188600	3190600	I mean, he certainly doesn't need any more money.
3190600	3192600	We're talking about a 20-year-old millionaire.
3192600	3194600	And now he's 22.
3194600	3196600	And I don't think much of... I'm sure it's all in good places.
3196600	3199600	Leafy's not the type of guy to go out and just blow all his money
3199600	3201600	or do something insanely insane.
3201600	3204600	And from what I understand, he lives,
3204600	3206600	I wouldn't even say relatively humble, small.
3206600	3208600	That's the way he is.
3208600	3210600	He said that he thought about it, but he's just simply not passionate.
3210600	3213600	You may see one more video about Leafy.
3213600	3216600	It wouldn't shock me if he acted like he was never away.
3216600	3219600	Like, hey guys, sorry I've been away for a while,
3219600	3221600	but check out this kid right here.
3221600	3223600	I could totally see that happening.
3223600	3226600	I totally could, but he's not passionate about it because it's not the same.
3226600	3229600	If I could make a gaming comparison,
3229600	3233600	Quake 3 was a staple of esports in its day,
3233600	3236600	and then Quake 4 came out and nobody liked it,
3236600	3238600	and it wasn't really a staple of esports.
3238600	3241600	I think that's the difference between 2016 and 2017.
3241600	3243600	And that's the way. It's just not fun.
3243600	3245600	He's well off. I don't think it's about money.
3245600	3247600	That's just the bonus.
3247600	3249600	I think it's about the high score.
3249600	3251600	And I think the way he sees it, he was champ.
3251600	3252600	He won this game.
3252600	3254600	And yeah, he could get back in it,
3254600	3256600	but it's not the same game that he was playing before,
3256600	3257600	so he's not that interesting.
3257600	3260600	I remember saying that Nerd City thinks that daily content
3260600	3263600	is actually being rejected by the algorithm,
3263600	3266600	so he said something to me to the effect of,
3266600	3268600	I could never do the daily grind again.
3268600	3270600	And I said, that's great because the daily grind
3270600	3271600	actually might hurt you in the algorithm.
3271600	3273600	I told him what Nerd City had told me.
3273600	3275600	And he's like, really?
3275600	3277600	And I started to realize that he's really been out of it
3277600	3279600	as far as being engaged in YouTube,
3279600	3281600	like content creators like you and me are.
3281600	3283600	That seems so foreign to him
3283600	3285600	that you didn't have to do the daily grind.
3285600	3287600	And it turned him off.
3287600	3289600	And he even said that it made him angry
3289600	3291600	because that's what I think he liked doing.
3291600	3293600	He liked hustling and he liked getting the high score.
3293600	3295600	And now the rules have changed as such
3295600	3297600	where it doesn't favor his strategy.
3297600	3298600	And I don't think that's an insult.
3298600	3299600	I think that's a fact.
3299600	3300600	I think actually he would agree with me.
3300600	3302600	And how can I say it's all not about money?
3302600	3303600	No, I think it's the number.
3303600	3305600	Some of us get off by getting the high score,
3305600	3307600	whether we get rewarded by money or not.
3307600	3308600	Everybody likes money,
3308600	3312600	but I do think that it's an extremely competitive nature.
3312600	3314600	Leave this type of guy to play Monopoly
3314600	3317600	and make sure he has everything locked up,
3317600	3319600	every house, and wins every deal.
3319600	3321600	And I think that's the key to his success.
3321600	3323600	Do I ever think he will overcome the hate?
3323600	3325600	I think everybody has a chance to overcome hate.
3325600	3327600	It just depends on how you present yourself.
3327600	3329600	Do I know how or what the key to that is?
3329600	3331600	My suggestion to him was a while ago.
3331600	3332600	I don't know if he heard me a lot.
3332600	3333600	It was over a year ago.
3333600	3336600	Come out as Calvin, not LeafyIsHere.
3336600	3338600	I think Calvin's way more interested in Leafy.
3338600	3339600	He's insight on the world.
3339600	3343600	He mentioned to me about writing a book about young people,
3343600	3344600	very young people,
3344600	3346600	receiving large sums of money for their work
3346600	3347600	and how it affects them.
3347600	3348600	That would be interesting to me.
3348600	3350600	That would make excellent videos.
3350600	3352600	I don't know if his fan base is ready for that,
3352600	3353600	but it might bring on a new one.
3353600	3355600	You know, we saw poods kind of grow
3355600	3358600	from a child entertainer to something more interesting.
3358600	3360600	I think Leafy's capable of that himself.
3360600	3361600	I don't know if he knows it.
3361600	3363600	Skype Leafy, depending on the presentation,
3363600	3365600	I don't know exactly how he should do it, would be,
3365600	3367600	for me, a lot more interesting.
3367600	3370600	Will it ever garner the hits that he once had?
3370600	3373600	Would it ever garner the growth that he once had?
3373600	3374600	Probably not.
3374600	3376600	But it would definitely,
3376600	3378600	I think it would definitely bring him a different audience,
3378600	3380600	and he definitely could be relevant again.
3380600	3382600	And by that, yeah, then he could overcome the hate
3382600	3384600	because he has a completely new crowd
3384600	3386600	and enough times went by.
3386600	3388600	Has Leafy changed since he left YouTube?
3388600	3390600	No, I don't think so.
3390600	3392600	I don't think so. He seems like the same guy to me.
3392600	3393600	He's a complicated dude.
3393600	3395600	I don't fully understand him.
3395600	3396600	He's very private.
3396600	3399600	Whenever we've gotten into personal conversations,
3399600	3400600	he kind of skirts them.
3400600	3402600	He talks about gaming. He talks about YouTube.
3402600	3403600	He talks about business.
3403600	3405600	Leafy talks about, you know, what he's interested in.
3405600	3407600	He's passionate about it, really passionate about it.
3407600	3409600	I just remember, I keep on bringing up Quake.
3409600	3410600	I mean, I remember when he says,
3410600	3413600	you played Quake back in the day?
3413600	3415600	And I was like, yeah, I did.
3415600	3418600	That area of like 1995 to 1999
3418600	3421600	was like a golden esports age to him, you know,
3421600	3423600	that he wasn't around for because he was younger.
3423600	3425600	I don't know if he was that bad to begin with.
3425600	3426600	Would his content change?
3426600	3428600	Maybe. Probably not. I don't know.
3428600	3430600	We're only talking about two years of time here.
3430600	3432600	You know, he's 20 and now he's 22.
3432600	3433600	So no, I don't think he's changed much at all.
3433600	3435600	Does he regret his YouTube career?
3435600	3437600	Absolutely not. I think he feels he won.
3437600	3439600	He was world champ. He was defeated.
3439600	3441600	He won the game and then he lost the game.
3441600	3443600	He was Mike Tyson for a while.
3443600	3444600	And then he lost.
3444600	3446600	No big deal. He's a gamer.
3446600	3447600	Pick up a new game.
3447600	3448600	And I think that's what he did.
3448600	3450600	No, I don't think he has any regrets whatsoever.
3450600	3452600	I don't think Leafy has too many regrets in life.
3452600	3454600	There's a lot of unseemly things about him
3454600	3456600	and there's a lot of unseemly things that he's done on YouTube.
3456600	3458600	And I've mentioned them in the past,
3458600	3462600	but I think that really it boils down to the gamer that he is.
3462600	3464600	The people that are on my news team
3464600	3465600	and help my channel and work for me,
3465600	3467600	I see them as friends even though I might not have stood
3467600	3468600	in front of all of them at some time.
3468600	3471600	And I think ColossusCrazy feels this way as well.
3471600	3474600	You're not friends until you shake hands, go out,
3474600	3476600	have a couple beers and know each other.
3476600	3479600	So I think sometimes, oh, this is not excusing his behavior.
3479600	3481600	I think he sees Nick Cash, Elvis the Alien,
3481600	3483600	and it does sound cold.
3483600	3487600	Me, Keemstar, great A under A, or maybe not great,
3487600	3491600	great he's close with as, you know, they're gamers
3491600	3493600	and he's there to beat them.
3493600	3495600	And I think that sometimes he doesn't recognize
3495600	3497600	that there's people behind that avatar.
3497600	3499600	And if I could defend him on that,
3499600	3501600	I think that has a lot to do with his age.
3501600	3504600	I think it has a lot to do with the fact that he never had kids.
3504600	3508600	I think it has a lot to do with that Leafy had a difficult upbringing.
3508600	3511600	That was one of the biggest embarrassments that I had
3511600	3512600	when I was attacking him.
3512600	3516600	I actually, and considering recent events, this is kind of funny.
3516600	3520600	I attacked him with information that I got from Michael McCrudden,
3520600	3522600	which is all wrong, of course.
3522600	3523600	And I remember I said something to them.
3523600	3526600	I mentioned this embarrassing moment, this attack that I used,
3526600	3527600	and I asked him if it was true.
3527600	3529600	And he says, where did you hear that from?
3529600	3533600	And it didn't really make me realize that he's a human being.
3533600	3536600	And it also made me realize that I was getting way too caught up in this shit.
3536600	3540600	You know how people say they don't give a fuck?
3540600	3543600	And you know when they're repeating it over and over again that they do?
3543600	3546600	Leafy really doesn't give a fuck.
3546600	3550600	I mean, all the horrible things that I said about him and his family
3550600	3554600	and the horrible things that I was willing to do to lower myself,
3554600	3557600	to get even with him, to help my hero Keemstar,
3557600	3558600	it's embarrassing.
3558600	3560600	Leafy's just a guy. He's just like you and me.
3560600	3562600	He's flawed. He's a little cold.
3562600	3567600	But he's fascinating and he's successful and he'll always be a YouTube legend.
3567600	3570600	And that's LeafyIsHere.
3570600	3572600	And I hope he does come back.
3572600	3574600	I'd be interested to see what he would do.
3574600	3578600	Well, everyone, that's probably the best testimony we're going to get
3578600	3583600	from someone who was close to Leafy and has spoken to Leafy very recently.
3583600	3586600	So once again, a big shout out to Tommy C.
3586600	3589600	You can check out his channel below, link in the description.
3589600	3591600	And that's about it for now.
3591600	3595600	I hope that this video has given some of you guys some closure about LeafyIsHere.
3595600	3598600	Some of you might say that I'm milking the subject,
3598600	3601600	but that's never really been my intention.
3601600	3605600	For me, the truth is that this is just a very interesting topic.
3605600	3609600	My goal for making this video, as well as the original Leafy video,
3609600	3612600	is to tackle some of these unanswered questions.
3612600	3615600	It boils down to the simple fact that Leafy had a huge following
3615600	3617600	and he just disappeared.
3617600	3621600	And I feel like people have a right to know at least some of what happened.
3621600	3623600	So for those of you who are still watching at this point,
3623600	3626600	thanks for tuning in. I'll catch you in the next one.
