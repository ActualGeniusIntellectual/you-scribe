00:00.000 --> 00:06.800
People of YouTube, it is I, the Duke of the Dank, the mayor of Meme Town,

00:06.800 --> 00:10.400
everyone's favorite YouTuber, Emperor Lemon.

00:10.400 --> 00:15.400
And today, in an unprecedented, unscripted commentary,

00:15.400 --> 00:20.500
we are going to discuss the fallout of the LeafyIsHere YouTube geographic.

00:20.500 --> 00:27.800
So first and foremost, let me just say that I have been completely blown away by the support for this video.

00:27.800 --> 00:31.600
This video must have really titillated Montazon's fancy,

00:31.600 --> 00:35.800
because in less than two weeks it got over a million views.

00:35.800 --> 00:38.800
Now I've had a few videos get to a million views in the past,

00:38.800 --> 00:42.600
but this is the fastest, by far, it's ever happened.

00:42.600 --> 00:47.800
And all the comments, all the messages I got from this video have been overwhelmingly positive.

00:47.800 --> 00:52.600
People really, really seem to like how I put this video together.

00:52.600 --> 00:58.600
I mean really, in the last seven days I've gained over 50,000 subscribers.

00:58.600 --> 01:05.900
And I've never really ever had anything like this happen before in eight years of making videos.

01:05.900 --> 01:16.400
So before I get into anything here, I have to first welcome all 50,000 of the new subscribers to the channel.

01:16.400 --> 01:21.800
Please feel free to make yourself at home, pour yourself a glass of downward spiral.

01:21.800 --> 01:26.600
If you subscribe to me for my editing capabilities,

01:26.600 --> 01:31.100
I regret to inform you that this video will not have any of those,

01:31.100 --> 01:37.300
just because I don't want to spend another two months working on a 40 plus minute video.

01:37.300 --> 01:42.900
In honor of Leafy, this video will feature random gameplay in the background,

01:42.900 --> 01:47.200
as I commentate over it with unrelated commentary.

01:47.200 --> 01:51.100
So now, without further ado, let's get into the discussion.

01:51.100 --> 01:56.400
So first of all, I kind of just want to address the background of this video.

01:56.400 --> 01:59.800
I want to answer why I made this video.

01:59.800 --> 02:04.400
Why, Emp? Why is this video 51 minutes?

02:04.400 --> 02:10.700
Me YouTuber, me no have attention span to watch 51 minute video.

02:10.700 --> 02:13.700
Why video must be 51 minute.

02:13.700 --> 02:17.300
Well, to tell you the truth, the video was originally going to be a lot shorter.

02:17.300 --> 02:22.100
I actually started writing the script for this video way back in November,

02:22.100 --> 02:24.900
after the very first episode of YouTube Geographic.

02:24.900 --> 02:32.600
However, any fans of the channel at that time will know that that was when I started my little mini crusade against YouTube,

02:32.600 --> 02:35.100
and I sort of put the script on the back burner.

02:35.100 --> 02:39.100
But originally, this video was probably going to be like every other generic,

02:39.100 --> 02:45.100
what happened to LeafyIsHere, and in hindsight, I'm glad it didn't turn out that way.

02:45.100 --> 02:50.900
My original inspiration to make the Leafy video came from just browsing on YouTube one day,

02:50.900 --> 02:53.400
and I looked at all the big commentary channels.

02:53.400 --> 02:57.200
I looked at H3H3, iDubbbz, Keemstar.

02:57.200 --> 03:04.500
I kind of just looked at all their stats and their subscribers just to see how much they had grown in the past year.

03:04.500 --> 03:11.000
And then I kind of remembered in the back of my head that Leafy was originally right there in the running with these guys,

03:11.000 --> 03:17.200
and he seemingly completely disappeared off the face of the earth.

03:17.200 --> 03:22.800
Now keep in mind, this was during a time before Leafy had actually stopped making videos,

03:22.800 --> 03:28.100
but I never actually heard a peep from him in the past year or so,

03:28.100 --> 03:30.500
and I was just kind of wondering what happened.

03:30.500 --> 03:35.300
I originally wanted to just explore the topic of Leafy's downfall,

03:35.300 --> 03:39.700
and how he managed to sort of hit rock bottom in terms of growth.

03:39.700 --> 03:44.200
Yeah, but then after I put the script on the back burner, a lot of interesting things started happening.

03:44.200 --> 03:55.300
First of all, the Tower Dog leaks came out, which provided a whole new insight into why Leafy sort of just disappeared from my recommended feed.

03:55.300 --> 04:02.700
And that leak was, of course, about YouTube's covert censorship of certain commentary channels.

04:02.700 --> 04:09.800
And after that, I began to look at the stats. I began to look at the analytics of Leafy's channel a lot more closely.

04:09.800 --> 04:20.700
And that was when I started to notice a lot of really irregular patterns that could not be explained under normal circumstances.

04:20.700 --> 04:30.700
And considering the Tower Dog allegations, it began to make a lot more sense to me that YouTube was tampering with Leafy's numbers,

04:30.700 --> 04:35.200
and suppressing him from being viewed by most of his audience.

04:35.200 --> 04:45.200
And about the same time, I made a lot of videos. I made a series of videos harshly criticizing YouTube and their decision-making and their management.

04:45.200 --> 04:52.000
And something very interesting happened the following January, February, and March.

04:52.000 --> 04:55.900
Looking at my own analytics, I could tell that something was way off.

04:55.900 --> 05:04.000
I've been around long enough on this website where I kind of have an expectation of how certain videos will perform.

05:04.000 --> 05:08.900
And these videos I uploaded during this stretch, and you can go back and watch them.

05:08.900 --> 05:14.900
There's a chance that any of you who've been subscribed over the duration might not have even seen some of them,

05:14.900 --> 05:21.200
because I got tons of reports from fans saying that my videos weren't showing up in the recommended,

05:21.200 --> 05:24.600
and my videos weren't showing up in their subscriptions.

05:24.600 --> 05:27.700
And everything was getting instantly demonetized.

05:27.700 --> 05:37.300
Even if it did not contain one shred of questionable content, they would still get instantly demonetized as I uploaded them.

05:37.300 --> 05:43.700
I remember making a Logan Paul rant about a week after the whole thing happened.

05:43.700 --> 05:49.800
And that video started off getting a ton of views, and then after about a day, it got age-restricted.

05:49.800 --> 05:58.000
And the official reason I got told for that was that they're age-restricting anything that depicts an image of the thumbnail,

05:58.000 --> 06:07.200
which doesn't really make much sense, because I recall seeing a ton of other videos that used the image of the thumbnail and they weren't age-restricted.

06:07.200 --> 06:14.400
So I got really paranoid around this time. I got paranoid that YouTube was sort of suppressing me.

06:14.400 --> 06:21.500
And of course now, obviously, in the light of my recent success with this video, that's clearly no longer the case.

06:21.500 --> 06:31.100
But still though, for a period of about three months, it just seemed like all the numbers on my channel were lower than they should have been.

06:31.100 --> 06:36.800
And that made me very concerned, and it made me very suspicious of YouTube.

06:36.800 --> 06:41.800
And when I first saw the Tower Dog leaks, I was a little bit skeptical.

06:41.800 --> 06:47.400
It just seemed awfully bizarre that YouTube would go after specific channels.

06:47.400 --> 06:54.400
At the time, it didn't really occur to me that they would even care about specific channels.

06:54.400 --> 07:04.100
But after that stretch of three months or so, where I felt like my account was targeted and suppressed by YouTube, I started looking into things a lot more.

07:04.100 --> 07:10.100
And that was about the time when I sort of renewed my interest in making the Leafy video.

07:10.100 --> 07:18.200
Because it began to dawn on me that what if the same thing that allegedly happened to me also happened to Leafy, but a hundred times worse?

07:18.200 --> 07:25.400
So after the Jimmy Kimmel video, I started researching and writing the LeafyWasHere script.

07:25.400 --> 07:34.100
And during my research, I began to unpack all these signs that supported the theory that YouTube suppressed Leafy's channel.

07:34.100 --> 07:46.600
And the more research I did, and the more evidence I found at this theory that YouTube suppressed Leafy's channel, the more I became sure that this was what happened to Leafy.

07:46.600 --> 07:55.100
And as I did more research, and as I dug deeper, I began to realize with confidence that Leafy got screwed.

07:55.100 --> 08:02.100
The dude got absolutely screwed over, and nobody really realizes it except for me.

08:02.100 --> 08:08.100
And you can go on YouTube right now and look at all the other What Happened to Leafy's Here videos, they're all kind of the same.

08:08.100 --> 08:11.800
They all cover the same sort of scope of events.

08:11.800 --> 08:23.600
But what I began to realize is that the story of Leafy goes so much deeper than kind of what's public knowledge, and what's generally presented by the commentary community.

08:23.600 --> 08:27.600
Leafy's disappearance just goes so much deeper than what everyone thinks.

08:27.600 --> 08:34.600
So with this new burden of knowledge, I felt like it was sort of my responsibility to present the whole story.

08:34.600 --> 08:40.600
And to present what I'm fairly certain is the truth of what actually happened to Leafy.

08:40.600 --> 08:43.600
So that's kind of why the video is 51 minutes long.

08:43.600 --> 08:54.600
It's because with the issue of LeafyIsHere, there's simply so much information to unpack, and I felt like I really needed to present that information adequately.

08:54.600 --> 08:59.600
There's simply too much of a story to tell to make the video any shorter.

08:59.600 --> 09:02.600
And thankfully, people really appreciated that effort.

09:02.600 --> 09:07.600
Of course, there were a few people commenting like, oh, 51 minutes, I'm not watching that.

09:07.600 --> 09:10.600
But I actually kind of turned it around on a lot of people.

09:10.600 --> 09:14.600
I saw some people commenting, oh, 51 minutes, that's too long.

09:14.600 --> 09:20.600
And then 51 minutes later, they leave a second comment saying, wow, that was actually pretty good.

09:20.600 --> 09:27.600
So for those of you guys who are patient, just like to stick around, watch the whole thing, I really appreciate it.

09:27.600 --> 09:39.600
And since this video got so much traction and created so much of a discussion, I felt like I was sort of obligated to follow up on it and respond to some unanswered questions that people might have had.

09:39.600 --> 09:46.600
So I took to Twitter and I asked my followers to post any questions they had about the Leafy video.

09:46.600 --> 09:56.600
And I got a ton of responses. I tried to narrow down what I'm covering to sort of a few general questions that a bunch of people were asking.

09:56.600 --> 09:57.600
So let's get into that.

09:57.600 --> 10:03.600
This person wonders what other types of YouTubers I think that the YouTube algorithm has tried to shut down.

10:03.600 --> 10:13.600
And this is a very interesting notion that I'm sure a lot of people inferred after I presented my theory about how YouTube censored Leafy's channel.

10:14.600 --> 10:20.600
If YouTube would go so far as to completely suppress Leafy's videos, what other type of censorship could they be doing?

10:20.600 --> 10:27.600
From what I've seen on YouTube, definitely a lot of political channels, they don't get very many views.

10:27.600 --> 10:42.600
Recently, gun channels, that was something that was actually reported on in the news where YouTube is kind of suppressing gun content now in the wake of the recent school shooting spree in America.

10:42.600 --> 10:48.600
When answering this question, it's kind of hard to tell for sure, but there's certainly patterns that you can observe.

10:48.600 --> 11:00.600
Basically anything YouTube lists in its demonetization guidelines, any channel related to those guidelines, have typically been shown to perform less well.

11:00.600 --> 11:09.600
I believe the YouTube censorship machine extends far and wide, but it covers a different extent depending on what kind of video it is.

11:09.600 --> 11:13.600
It's very interesting what you can observe out there if you keep your eyes open.

11:13.600 --> 11:21.600
Lots of people asked for my thoughts on what Leafy could have done to sort of redeem himself in the eyes of the general public.

11:21.600 --> 11:27.600
Well personally, I think Leafy's downfall boils down to two very critical moments.

11:27.600 --> 11:31.600
The first one was the Tommy NC rant and subsequent backlash.

11:31.600 --> 11:37.600
I think that was the first real moment where a substantial number of people turned against Leafy.

11:37.600 --> 11:44.600
Before that, it was basically just smooth sailing for him, but that was sort of the first crack in his empire.

11:44.600 --> 11:54.600
I think if after the Tommy NC video, Leafy had just sort of stopped roasting individual people, he might very well still be around today.

11:54.600 --> 12:03.600
A lot of people commented on my Leafy video saying that they used to be subscribed to Leafy and they enjoyed his rants and his story time videos,

12:03.600 --> 12:09.600
but they kind of lost interest once he just started becoming primarily a roast channel.

12:09.600 --> 12:19.600
And honestly, I think if he had just gone back to that style of giving personal stories, personal anecdotes, he would have been fine, and he would still be quite popular today.

12:19.600 --> 12:29.600
But anyway, after the Tommy NC video, I think him deciding not to change up his style and just to continue with roasting random people on the internet,

12:29.600 --> 12:34.600
I think that was the point of no return for him because after that point, YouTube got involved.

12:34.600 --> 12:40.600
And once YouTube kind of sort of put the clamp on his channel, he could not really recover.

12:40.600 --> 12:47.600
Now, the second critical point for Leafy was the content cop response.

12:47.600 --> 12:54.600
So if the Tommy NC incident is sort of what caused Leafy's numbers to go down across the board,

12:54.600 --> 13:01.600
the content cop response is what caused him to sort of lose the respect of the majority of the commentary community.

13:01.600 --> 13:11.600
I think had Leafy just sort of owned up to the criticism instead of just responding to it negatively, like he just sort of did with any old YouTuber,

13:11.600 --> 13:21.600
I think if he had shown some humility, some empathy in that situation, I think it's fair to say that he wouldn't have been hated nearly to the extent that he was.

13:22.600 --> 13:27.600
But unfortunately for him, he kind of handled the response to content cop poorly.

13:27.600 --> 13:29.600
And as a result, he got hated.

13:29.600 --> 13:35.600
And an unfortunate side effect of that was that once Leafy's videos started disappearing from everyone's recommended,

13:35.600 --> 13:42.600
no one really cared and no one sought to investigate that further just because of the extent that he was hated.

13:42.600 --> 13:47.600
Several people asked me about the research process of my videos.

13:47.600 --> 13:56.600
Well, the first thing I do when I get an idea, I often casually research the topic months in advance, months before even starting a script.

13:56.600 --> 13:58.600
It's not as difficult as it probably sounds.

13:58.600 --> 14:07.600
It's usually just something I'm curious about and I gradually look deeper and deeper into it, slowly gathering facts.

14:07.600 --> 14:13.600
And what I do is instead of just presenting a bunch of random facts about an incident or a topic,

14:13.600 --> 14:18.600
I really strive to piece together sort of a narrative of what happened.

14:18.600 --> 14:24.600
And then I try to find evidence and screenshots and videos that support that narrative.

14:24.600 --> 14:30.600
For the research process, I spend a ton of time on the Wayback Machine, the web archive.

14:30.600 --> 14:36.600
That's how I got most of the footage and screenshots on the Leafy video.

14:36.600 --> 14:43.600
The web archive is just a tremendous resource for finding information about stuff that happened in the past.

14:43.600 --> 14:49.600
You'd be surprised the amount of information you can find on that website.

14:49.600 --> 14:57.600
And it's very helpful because over time on the internet, a lot of information and truth sort of just gets buried very quickly.

14:57.600 --> 15:03.600
Like for example, going into this video, I had no idea Leafy even made Minecraft videos.

15:03.600 --> 15:12.600
Yet that was a core part of his channel for three years and it's actually somewhat insightful for explaining why Leafy did some of the things he did.

15:12.600 --> 15:16.600
It was because he learned a lot of these traits during the Minecraft era.

15:16.600 --> 15:20.600
But until my video, no one really talked about that.

15:20.600 --> 15:25.600
It was something I had to learn myself going through all the old past screenshots of his channel.

15:25.600 --> 15:29.600
Lots of people asked me about what my thoughts were on grade A under A.

15:29.600 --> 15:36.600
I referenced grade A in the video, but there was never really a point where I discussed anything about him.

15:36.600 --> 15:44.600
For those of you who don't know, grade A under A was another commentary channel that got popular around the same time as Leafy.

15:44.600 --> 15:47.600
And they were actually friends behind the scenes.

15:48.600 --> 15:56.600
And kind of like Leafy, grade A had this very endearing style where he would just sort of openly rant about a bunch of topics.

15:56.600 --> 16:05.600
And his production quality was really poor, but people didn't care just because the way he spoke was so charismatic and captivating.

16:05.600 --> 16:07.600
People just kind of wanted to get behind him.

16:07.600 --> 16:11.600
So what happened to grade was that after 2016, he kind of just stopped making videos.

16:11.600 --> 16:14.600
About a year before Leafy stopped, actually.

16:14.600 --> 16:18.600
And kind of just like Leafy, you don't really hear about anything from him anymore.

16:18.600 --> 16:27.600
I did have a look at his analytics, and interestingly, they show a similar pattern to Leafy's analytics where they suddenly fall off and they just never recover.

16:27.600 --> 16:35.600
And the reason that's so interesting is because grade A was also one of the channels listed in the Tower Dog leak in the YouTube memo.

16:35.600 --> 16:41.600
It was one of the named channels that YouTube sort of wanted gone from the platform.

16:41.600 --> 16:45.600
And so I find it very interesting how he sort of disappeared as well.

16:45.600 --> 16:51.600
You could kind of attribute a lot of that to him just not making videos for almost two years now.

16:51.600 --> 17:00.600
But still though, it's something to consider how he was also one of the targeted channels in YouTube's alleged suppression effort.

17:00.600 --> 17:04.600
And how he, just like Leafy, is not around anymore.

17:04.600 --> 17:08.600
I probably won't do a YouTube geographic on grade A.

17:08.600 --> 17:17.600
Kind of just because much of the content of that hypothetical video would pretty much already have been covered in the Leafy video.

17:17.600 --> 17:23.600
But it's still an interesting topic nonetheless, and I suggest other people look into that.

17:23.600 --> 17:26.600
Phoenix Haggard asks if the project was fun.

17:26.600 --> 17:32.600
Well, I don't know if fun is the right word, but I did enjoy making the project.

17:32.600 --> 17:39.600
I really enjoyed the aspects of sort of piecing together a story that no one really knows yet.

17:39.600 --> 17:49.600
And just having the dramatic irony knowing that once I upload this video, it's kind of going to change the way people think about this certain issue.

17:49.600 --> 17:53.600
So that was very important in motivating me to finish this.

17:53.600 --> 18:00.600
The whole effort of the video from writing to editing probably took me over 40 days of work.

18:00.600 --> 18:03.600
And the video did end up running very long.

18:03.600 --> 18:10.600
There are certain points during editing where it does get very tedious and you kind of just want it to be over.

18:10.600 --> 18:17.600
But like I said, the idea of sort of changing people's minds about an issue is highly motivating.

18:17.600 --> 18:23.600
And it made me very excited to finish this video and put it up online for everyone to see.

18:23.600 --> 18:28.600
A few people wanted to know if I think Leafy will ever come back to YouTube.

18:28.600 --> 18:31.600
And personally, I think he'll be back.

18:31.600 --> 18:41.600
Partially for reasons that I'll get into later, but mostly because YouTube is just such a magnet of attention right now.

18:41.600 --> 18:48.600
It's pretty difficult to go anywhere on the internet and escape YouTube's pull.

18:48.600 --> 18:52.600
I'm pretty sure that Leafy, wherever he is, still uses the internet.

18:52.600 --> 18:56.600
He most likely does not live like an Amish person.

18:56.600 --> 19:03.600
And I think it's fair to say that he probably anonymously watches YouTube every now and then.

19:03.600 --> 19:08.600
I honestly just think he got burnt out from all the hate and he's taking a break.

19:08.600 --> 19:12.600
And I'm fairly confident that one day he will return.

19:12.600 --> 19:19.600
This person asks me sort of what I've learned from the whole experience of researching and producing this video.

19:19.600 --> 19:27.600
And if Leafy had learned anything, well first of all for me, I definitely fear YouTube a lot more now.

19:27.600 --> 19:34.600
Because I'm fairly certain that they blackballed Leafy out of existence on the platform.

19:34.600 --> 19:38.600
And if they can do that, they can do the same to me or you.

19:38.600 --> 19:43.600
So I had always suspected that YouTube was corrupt to an extent.

19:43.600 --> 19:48.600
But researching this video really put that whole notion in a whole new light.

19:48.600 --> 19:54.600
Where this is an actual tangible event that YouTube has done to a person.

19:54.600 --> 20:00.600
Also while making this video, I learned that sort of the YouTube process, the YouTube game,

20:00.600 --> 20:04.600
it can really have some negative effects on people.

20:04.600 --> 20:08.600
A lot of people think that being a YouTuber is just the easiest thing in the world.

20:08.600 --> 20:12.600
And you just upload gaming videos and you basically print money.

20:12.600 --> 20:18.600
But this whole Leafy thing made me realize a very dark side of YouTube.

20:18.600 --> 20:26.600
Where the whole YouTube process, all the fame, all the fans, it can really mess with someone's psychology and mental health.

20:26.600 --> 20:29.600
And Leafy is a tragic case of that.

20:29.600 --> 20:34.600
And this was one of the themes I tried to portray in the video with the whole shining motif.

20:34.600 --> 20:37.600
YouTube began to control Leafy, not the other way around.

20:37.600 --> 20:46.600
Leafy just became so obsessed with getting views and subscribers that he sort of lost sight of a lot of stuff that made him human.

20:46.600 --> 20:48.600
And that's very dark to say.

20:48.600 --> 20:54.600
But if you look at the whole story of Leafy, he started out as just a kid playing Minecraft and having fun with friends.

20:54.600 --> 21:00.600
And slowly but surely, YouTube fame kind of poisoned him and poisoned his mind.

21:00.600 --> 21:04.600
And turned him into sort of this mini tyrannical dictator.

21:04.600 --> 21:12.600
And it's very sad how YouTube and fame can do that to otherwise decent people.

21:12.600 --> 21:15.600
Now do I think Leafy learned something? Probably.

21:15.600 --> 21:23.600
I think the fact that he quit at all and just stopped making videos may be a sign that he finally realized his wrongdoings.

21:23.600 --> 21:28.600
He finally realized the extent to which he was hated and the damage that he had done.

21:28.600 --> 21:33.600
And if Leafy returns, he might see a completely changed man.

21:33.600 --> 21:36.600
And hopefully he will have learned from his mistakes.

21:42.600 --> 21:46.600
So here's the big popular YouTuber collusion bonus round.

21:46.600 --> 21:48.600
Mumkey Jones asks,

21:48.600 --> 21:51.600
When will you make a Mumkey documentary?

21:51.600 --> 21:56.600
Well, Mumkey, if you're talking about the crossover video we did, the answer to that is a few days ago.

21:56.600 --> 22:01.600
So if you guys want to watch me narrate a Mumkey Jones documentary, check out the video on Mumkey's channel.

22:01.600 --> 22:03.600
Link in the description.

22:03.600 --> 22:12.600
If you're asking about the Mumkey Jones YouTube geographic, I'm afraid I can't do one on you yet because you haven't gone on the downward spiral.

22:12.600 --> 22:15.600
You see, YouTube empires are interesting.

22:15.600 --> 22:20.600
But YouTube empires that go on a downward spiral, that's YouTube geographic worthy.

22:20.600 --> 22:25.600
I don't know, Mumkey. All I see when I look at your channel is your numbers are going up.

22:25.600 --> 22:28.600
You're raking in the fans.

22:28.600 --> 22:30.600
You're just too successful right now.

22:30.600 --> 22:34.600
And I'm afraid I can't produce a Leafy-style documentary on you yet.

22:34.600 --> 22:36.600
Internet Historian asks,

22:36.600 --> 22:38.600
What was the file size of the video?

22:38.600 --> 22:42.600
And the answer to that is 4.56 gigabytes.

22:42.600 --> 22:47.600
Yeah, the 51-minute 1080p videos will do that to you.

22:47.600 --> 22:56.600
Turkey Tom brings up an interesting hypothetical if I would rather have a situation where Leafy never lost popularity.

22:56.600 --> 23:07.600
And it's kind of a difficult question to answer because it's really hard to tell what would have happened if Leafy had never fallen off his throne on the commentary community.

23:07.600 --> 23:17.600
I definitely think that if Leafy had not lost popularity, he would probably be somewhere around the 8 to 10 million subscriber range by now.

23:17.600 --> 23:23.600
And it would be very interesting to see him go toe-to-toe with channels like Logan Paul and RiceGum.

23:23.600 --> 23:30.600
But at the same time, what kind of effect would that have on sort of the toxicity of his community?

23:30.600 --> 23:38.600
If you took the height of Leafy's empire and doubled that, how much of a problem would that make for sort of the YouTube community as a whole?

23:38.600 --> 23:44.600
Would Leafy even be able to achieve those numbers continuing to roast people?

23:44.600 --> 23:52.600
Or was his decline kind of inevitable because YouTube viewed him as such a threat to the well-being of the website?

23:52.600 --> 23:59.600
You have to kind of consider all of those factors when considering the hypothetical of Leafy still being popular today.

23:59.600 --> 24:07.600
As for the current status quo in sort of the commentary sphere of YouTube, it's pretty stagnant as far as I can tell.

24:07.600 --> 24:13.600
Where Leafy died, he kind of gave rise to about half a dozen Leafy clones.

24:13.600 --> 24:19.600
I'm not going to name any names, but you guys probably know who I'm talking about.

24:19.600 --> 24:25.600
All of them are kind of the same, very little distinction between any of those channels.

24:25.600 --> 24:29.600
They all have around the same subscribers, they make videos on the same topics.

24:29.600 --> 24:38.600
And as a result, they kind of took Leafy's old audience and split them several ways, so none of them really stand out that much.

24:38.600 --> 24:47.600
And the relevancy of all these commentary channels have sort of been dwarfed by the kind of status quo, prototypical YouTube vlog channels.

24:47.600 --> 24:57.600
It's hard to say that any of them really have hardly as much clout as what Leafy once possessed in throwing his weight around on YouTube.

24:57.600 --> 25:03.600
So I guess in summary to answer this question, I would sort of lean towards preferring how things are now,

25:03.600 --> 25:08.600
just because I felt that Leafy's decline was kind of inevitable anyway.

25:08.600 --> 25:13.600
And the decline of Leafy kind of ushered in an entirely new era of YouTube.

25:13.600 --> 25:18.600
I think the idea of Leafy sticking around and staying popular would have only delayed the inevitable.

25:18.600 --> 25:23.600
This guy kind of wants to know my thoughts on YouTube's sort of abuse of power,

25:23.600 --> 25:30.600
and how they can sort of wave a magic wand, pull some strings behind the scenes, and decide if a channel lives or dies.

25:30.600 --> 25:33.600
I certainly think it's concerning, to say the least.

25:33.600 --> 25:38.600
I remember a time when YouTube was pretty impartial with these kinds of things,

25:38.600 --> 25:49.600
but you keep hearing reports time and time again that they seem to really want to limit and kind of throttle content that doesn't really fit the prototypical YouTube mold.

25:49.600 --> 25:55.600
In the past few years at least, there's been a very heavy emphasis on preserving family-friendly content,

25:55.600 --> 26:02.600
and pretty much anything that deals with mature subject matter gets kind of throttled and blocked.

26:02.600 --> 26:08.600
And I guess my biggest concern over how YouTube sort of operates their business model now,

26:08.600 --> 26:17.600
is that the entire website of YouTube will get stuck with this reputation of being just a kiddie kid website,

26:17.600 --> 26:20.600
where the only stuff on there is stuff for children.

26:20.600 --> 26:26.600
And you'll start to see a mass exodus of adult content consumers on YouTube.

26:26.600 --> 26:33.600
It's never really a good look, and it's never really sustainable for anything to kind of become labeled as a kid's thing.

26:33.600 --> 26:43.600
Another consequence I want to point out is sort of how in systematically eliminating the more bizarre, the more obscure, the more edgy content creators on YouTube,

26:43.600 --> 26:52.600
YouTube is forming a situation where the vast, vast, vast majority of content is incredibly saturated and incredibly similar.

26:52.600 --> 27:01.600
And I feel like in the last several years on YouTube there's been a very big sort of de-emphasis on actually putting effort and substance into your content.

27:01.600 --> 27:10.600
It's all about just hitting that 10 minute threshold and putting enough little bells and whistles in your videos just to keep your viewers' attention for long enough,

27:10.600 --> 27:15.600
and just giving them something to play in a tab while they're doing something else.

27:15.600 --> 27:22.600
Rather than actually making interesting, dynamic, complex content that demands your viewers' attention.

27:22.600 --> 27:31.600
So yeah, those are the main consequences that could seriously jeopardize the future of YouTube based on how they're running the website today.

27:31.600 --> 27:40.600
Trent brings up a very interesting point, where based on my theory, if YouTube thought Leafy was such a big problem and set such a bad example for YouTube,

27:40.600 --> 27:52.600
why don't they go after the entire sphere of douche YouTubers whose ridiculous antics set really bad examples for the impressionable youth watching their videos?

27:52.600 --> 27:56.600
And that's a very good question. It's a question I ask myself a lot.

27:56.600 --> 28:04.600
If I could give any theory as to why this is the case, I would probably relate it back to the little motif in my Leafy video,

28:04.600 --> 28:10.600
where I talk about the really rich, successful YouTuber with a Lamborghini in his mansion.

28:10.600 --> 28:19.600
You see, you have to ask yourself how YouTube as a business can continue to entice new people to produce content for them.

28:19.600 --> 28:26.600
And I think what they do is they promote rich, successful looking people from Hollywood to the top of the website,

28:26.600 --> 28:42.600
So every new viewer who watches YouTube, most of the content they watch will be from a really wealthy, attractive, vlogger-type person who lives in a mansion and has an expensive, exotic car and sleeps with a supermodel every night.

28:42.600 --> 28:52.600
And through enough repetition of this, new viewers will begin to associate YouTubers with an opulent, wealthy, celebrity lifestyle.

28:52.600 --> 28:56.600
And they'll use that image as motivation to produce content.

28:56.600 --> 29:04.600
You see, the way I look at YouTube is that you have to understand that everything they do has an official meaning and then it has an actual meaning.

29:04.600 --> 29:11.600
Like, for example, watch time. YouTube has placed so much emphasis on watch time over the past five years.

29:11.600 --> 29:15.600
The official explanation for the incredible emphasis on watch time is,

29:15.600 --> 29:23.600
Well, we want YouTubers to make higher quality content, and if people are watching the videos for longer, that must mean the content is higher quality.

29:23.600 --> 29:28.600
That's what they tell you, but in reality, we can clearly observe that that's not the case.

29:28.600 --> 29:41.600
On average, content on YouTube has become a lot more watered down, a lot more bland, a lot more boring, and much less likely to keep your attention than it was back when they had a ten minute maximum on videos.

29:41.600 --> 29:45.600
You see, the truth of why YouTube mandates that you increase watch time is,

29:45.600 --> 29:50.600
One, advertisers pay a higher rate for longer videos, and that makes them more money.

29:50.600 --> 29:59.600
And two, the longer you make people watch YouTube videos, the less time they spend on a competitor site like Facebook or Amazon.

29:59.600 --> 30:04.600
So YouTube has sort of a double meaning for every action they do.

30:04.600 --> 30:13.600
And you can kind of apply that theory to taking down Leafy. Of course, they never admit to it, but it's pretty clear from what I've researched that they did it.

30:13.600 --> 30:19.600
And I'm sure if they ever came out and talked about it, the official explanation would be something along the lines of,

30:19.600 --> 30:29.600
Oh, he violated the guidelines, he incited cyberbullying, he harassed children. They come up with a long official laundry list like that.

30:29.600 --> 30:37.600
But realistically, if you want to put a tinfoil hat on your tinfoil hat, I think that they might have gotten rid of him because he didn't fit the YouTuber brand.

30:37.600 --> 30:48.600
He didn't look like one of those attractive blonde Hollywood vloggers, and he was actually quite outspoken about several issues rather than being really vapid and innocuous.

30:48.600 --> 30:59.600
And they kind of viewed his whole image and sort of his whole incitement of rebellion as really unstable for the whole YouTube image.

30:59.600 --> 31:04.600
That's the best I can do to explain why YouTube systematically got rid of Leafy.

31:04.600 --> 31:11.600
While they let really douchey vloggers who are really guilty of many of the same things that Leafy was guilty of,

31:11.600 --> 31:17.600
they let them just run completely roughshod and connect to however many young impressionable fans they want.

31:17.600 --> 31:21.600
So that's an interesting little game you can play whenever YouTube says they're doing something.

31:21.600 --> 31:26.600
Try to find the ulterior motive that's different from the official explanation.

31:26.600 --> 31:35.600
This guy brings up an interesting dilemma where the act of roasting popular YouTubers actually feeds into the popularity even more.

31:35.600 --> 31:37.600
And I kind of agree with that sentiment.

31:37.600 --> 31:42.600
An example I bring up is the Logan Paul KSI boxing match.

31:42.600 --> 31:47.600
Logan or Jake Paul, I forget which everyone's fighting him, but here's a boxing match that's happening.

31:47.600 --> 31:57.600
And if you seriously think that they're doing this genuinely to settle beef, then you're probably a child who watches one of them

31:57.600 --> 32:05.600
because it's very clear that this is just a massive marketing opportunity to stimulate interest for both parties.

32:05.600 --> 32:16.600
It's just sort of a corporate, artificial feud that kind of preys on people's hunger for drama and exploits people for attention.

32:16.600 --> 32:24.600
It's part of the reason why I kind of miss 2016 because a lot of that beef in 2016 was actually legitimate and not staged.

32:24.600 --> 32:34.600
But to go back to the general question, yeah, by and large, most conflict and drama on YouTube literally only serves to help both channels that are involved.

32:34.600 --> 32:42.600
The worst case scenario in a situation like this is that you get a ton of haters, but they still watch your videos anyway

32:42.600 --> 32:46.600
and they still give you revenue just because they want to see you respond to the drama.

32:46.600 --> 32:56.600
And it's not just YouTube. You see stuff like this show up all over the place in entertainment where by and large it's better to be hated than to be irrelevant.

32:56.600 --> 33:05.600
And this guy brings up another interesting point where he talks about how in sort of a continuation of the demonetization system,

33:05.600 --> 33:10.600
YouTube sort of made PewDiePie out to be the scapegoat for the whole thing.

33:10.600 --> 33:13.600
And I think on YouTube's end, they definitely succeeded.

33:13.600 --> 33:20.600
If you ask most people online, they would tell you that demonetization began after the whole PewDiePie racism controversy.

33:20.600 --> 33:24.600
And that's what most of the news articles about it report, but it's not actually true.

33:24.600 --> 33:35.600
YouTube's demonetization began back in August 2016, coincidentally a few months after YouTube's alleged secret meeting where they wanted to get rid of certain creators.

33:35.600 --> 33:40.600
So yeah, demonetization actually began six months before most people think it did.

33:40.600 --> 33:46.600
And I definitely think there was some scapegoating on YouTube's end at PewDiePie's expense.

33:46.600 --> 33:54.600
Come to think of it, PewDiePie has kind of become the go-to scapegoat for YouTube controversy lately, and it's kind of a shame.

33:54.600 --> 33:58.600
I don't think he deserves most of the criticism he gets from the media.

33:58.600 --> 34:06.600
The notion that PewDiePie started the demonetization system is certainly a prevailing misconception in mainstream society.

34:06.600 --> 34:15.600
And it's a shame because if people really looked into the issue, they'd see it extends far further than just a small racism controversy.

34:15.600 --> 34:22.600
And the final sort of question I want to discuss in this video is, lots of people asked me, where do I think Leafy is now?

34:22.600 --> 34:29.600
And to be perfectly honest, I have no idea where Leafy is now, and I'm pretty sure no one really does.

34:29.600 --> 34:37.600
Outside of his close circle of real-life friends, I was not able to get in contact with Leafy.

34:37.600 --> 34:43.600
However, I was able to get in contact with YouTube's favorite clown, Colossal's Crazy.

34:43.600 --> 34:54.600
Colossal actually reached out to me after viewing my video, and for those of you who aren't aware, Colossal's Crazy was one of Leafy's few true friends in the commentary community from back in the day.

34:54.600 --> 35:02.600
He sent me some messages that offer a lot of insight regarding Leafy's mindset and attitude with regards to YouTube.

35:02.600 --> 35:06.600
And with his permission, I'm going to share some of those messages with you right now.

35:06.600 --> 35:10.600
I haven't spoken to him in over six months, but we used to speak every day.

35:10.600 --> 35:14.600
He's totally disappeared from the internet, can't even get a hold of him on Skype.

35:14.600 --> 35:18.600
He even forgot the password to the email that accessed his Twitter.

35:18.600 --> 35:21.600
It's kind of sad because we used to get on really well and speak all the time.

35:21.600 --> 35:28.600
Don't blame him though, YouTube fucked him over, and after that, all he was left with was a bunch of mindless sheep hating him,

35:28.600 --> 35:33.600
and having videos made on him by many commentators who are guilty of everything he was doing.

35:33.600 --> 35:36.600
The commentary community is riddled with hypocrites, honestly.

35:36.600 --> 35:40.600
He was definitely a bit of a sociopath, not like full-blown, but a bit.

35:40.600 --> 35:46.600
He was borderline obsessed with YouTube, it became a real ego thing for him, it was pretty much all he had.

35:46.600 --> 35:52.600
This dude was a multi-millionaire, but he spent less than someone on minimum wage would spend in a year.

35:52.600 --> 35:56.600
That's how deep he was into YouTube, pretty much never left his room and ate cheap packet noodles.

35:56.600 --> 36:01.600
He actually hated making videos, had no passion for the creative process whatsoever.

36:01.600 --> 36:04.600
He didn't like his own fans or interacting with them.

36:04.600 --> 36:07.600
He hated all other YouTubers and, quite rightly, didn't trust them.

36:07.600 --> 36:10.600
After a while, he didn't even care about the money.

36:10.600 --> 36:14.600
It was literally just a number to him at that point, and he didn't even know what to spend it on.

36:14.600 --> 36:18.600
Just seeing millions of views and the subscriber gains, that's the kind of stuff he got off on.

36:18.600 --> 36:23.600
I personally never understood it, but I guess everyone has different drives and motivations.

36:23.600 --> 36:27.600
So when YouTube fucked him, he had literally no reason to continue.

36:27.600 --> 36:30.600
He knew that no matter what he did, he was fucked forever.

36:30.600 --> 36:33.600
Even if he changed up his content, he was fucked.

36:33.600 --> 36:36.600
Maybe if he was encouraged more to continue, he'd still be around.

36:36.600 --> 36:39.600
But of course, the LeafyHate train was in full steam.

36:39.600 --> 36:43.600
If he came back to YouTube today, he'd probably be a very different person.

36:43.600 --> 36:47.600
That said, he did some altogether pretty fucked up things in the time I knew him.

36:47.600 --> 36:51.600
Even as his friend, sometimes it was hard to feel sorry for him when things backfired.

36:51.600 --> 36:53.600
He never deserved what happened though.

36:53.600 --> 36:56.600
He's actually really intelligent, believe it or not.

36:56.600 --> 36:58.600
He just had no life experience.

36:58.600 --> 37:02.600
Not even because of his age, but because everything he understood came from the internet.

37:02.600 --> 37:05.600
When I first met him, he was still living with his mother.

37:05.600 --> 37:07.600
He didn't know how to deal with basic problems,

37:07.600 --> 37:11.600
and despite the fact that he'd always ask for advice, he'd rarely ever take it.

37:11.600 --> 37:15.600
I see a ton of commentators now saying, bring back Leafy or I miss Leafy.

37:15.600 --> 37:19.600
Nine times out of ten, they're saying that because they finally realized that,

37:19.600 --> 37:23.600
actually, them and their mates are doing the same thing he was doing.

37:23.600 --> 37:28.600
In all my time on YouTube, I've never seen such an insane case of bandwagoning.

37:28.600 --> 37:30.600
Even with Keemstar, it wasn't as bad.

37:30.600 --> 37:32.600
And that was fucking bad.

37:32.600 --> 37:35.600
I have no respect for the majority of the viewers in this community.

37:35.600 --> 37:37.600
They are led by the nose wherever they go.

37:37.600 --> 37:41.600
For the majority of viewers in the drama slash commentary community,

37:41.600 --> 37:44.600
they don't actually have the first clue of what good content is.

37:44.600 --> 37:49.600
They physically need someone to tell them what is and what isn't good content,

37:49.600 --> 37:53.600
and who is and who isn't someone worth watching, based on that and who they are.

37:53.600 --> 37:55.600
I defended him a fair bit on the Baited podcast.

37:55.600 --> 37:58.600
Maybe six to seven episodes, I can't remember.

37:58.600 --> 38:03.600
100% your typical commentator didn't want to defend Leafy at all for the reasons you mentioned.

38:03.600 --> 38:06.600
For me, I never considered making a video or anything.

38:06.600 --> 38:08.600
I don't think I'd ever really make a video like that.

38:08.600 --> 38:12.600
I definitely got a lot of hate for even associating with Leafy.

38:12.600 --> 38:15.600
Nowhere near as much for associating with Keem, to be sure,

38:15.600 --> 38:17.600
but that's honestly never really put me off.

38:17.600 --> 38:19.600
Obviously, Keem had his own beef with Leafy.

38:19.600 --> 38:24.600
Grade supported Leafy behind the scenes, and Pyrocynical wasn't really that good friends with Leafy.

38:24.600 --> 38:29.600
Leafy was only friends with three people, Keemstar, Grade, and myself.

38:29.600 --> 38:32.600
Everyone either disliked him or were fairly neutral with him.

38:32.600 --> 38:37.600
So yeah, definitely the main reason people didn't defend him was because of the bandwagon.

38:37.600 --> 38:39.600
It was the unpopular opinion.

38:39.600 --> 38:42.600
There were some things he did that were completely indefensible, of course,

38:42.600 --> 38:46.600
but much of the hate coming from other YouTubers was hypocritical, to say the least.

38:46.600 --> 38:49.600
I definitely was Leafy's biggest offender way back when.

38:49.600 --> 38:52.600
Did I do enough as a friend? That's a good question, I suppose.

38:52.600 --> 38:54.600
But I'd say yes, otherwise I'd have done more.

38:54.600 --> 38:59.600
When it comes down to it, in my eyes, Leafy was guilty and deserved criticism for the following.

38:59.600 --> 39:05.600
Low quality content, making videos on children, his videos on Keemstar, what he did to Nick Cash.

39:05.600 --> 39:08.600
A few other minor things maybe, but that's pretty much it.

39:08.600 --> 39:13.600
As far as the clickbait goes, who cares? 99% of YouTubers seem to be doing that.

39:13.600 --> 39:17.600
The video stretching? Again, so many of his peers seem to be doing that.

39:17.600 --> 39:19.600
The social ineptitude? Welcome to YouTube.

39:19.600 --> 39:21.600
What else was there, really?

39:21.600 --> 39:25.600
Far and beyond his biggest fuck-ups from my perspective were everything he was doing to children.

39:25.600 --> 39:27.600
That was just completely indefensible.

39:27.600 --> 39:32.600
Everything paled in comparison to that, but it's often been far from his biggest criticism.

39:32.600 --> 39:36.600
When you measure what he's done to what others do today, the hate was never warranted.

39:36.600 --> 39:42.600
I see what others are doing, some of which are also friends of mine, and it's either the same thing or worse.

39:42.600 --> 39:47.600
People have this idea in their head that Leafy is this fucking evil bastard.

39:47.600 --> 39:55.600
That's just not the case, and these exact same people seem to have no problem with another YouTuber when he does the exact same thing.

39:55.600 --> 40:02.600
It's a mob mentality that's absolutely stereotypical with the average content consumer in this particular genre."

40:02.600 --> 40:07.600
So it would seem that Colossal had a lot to say on Leafy's behalf.

40:07.600 --> 40:15.600
It's clear that he certainly resented the commentary community a lot for what they did to Leafy following the Content Cop.

40:15.600 --> 40:21.600
I find it very interesting that he sort of reaffirmed many of the theories I brought up in my Leafy video.

40:21.600 --> 40:29.600
Most importantly, according to Colossal, he and Leafy both had a strong belief that YouTube was deliberately suppressing Leafy's content.

40:29.600 --> 40:35.600
I also found it very interesting what Colossal said about the psychology behind Leafy.

40:35.600 --> 40:41.600
You know, in my video about Leafy, I included the motif of The Shining as sort of a metaphorical device.

40:41.600 --> 40:46.600
However, according to what Colossal said, it might have turned out to be not too far from reality,

40:46.600 --> 40:51.600
where apparently Leafy became legitimately obsessed with the idea of YouTube fame,

40:51.600 --> 40:57.600
and just like I said in my video, his subscriber count quite literally began to control him.

40:57.600 --> 41:07.600
So ultimately, although Colossal's testimony was very insightful, it doesn't really answer the question as to what Leafy is up to now.

41:07.600 --> 41:14.600
And originally, this was going to be the end of the video. Just a very unsatisfying, mostly unresolved ending.

41:14.600 --> 41:26.600
However, as I was editing this project, another member of the original Baited podcast, Tommy C, messaged me and came forward with his own information about Leafy.

41:26.600 --> 41:34.600
He actually informed me that Leafy contacted him very recently, after a period of not hearing from him for over six months.

41:34.600 --> 41:40.600
So based on that, I decided to ask Tommy a series of questions related to Leafy, and this is what he had to say.

41:40.600 --> 41:44.600
When was the last time that you had contact with Leafy?

41:44.600 --> 41:51.600
Well, up until the other day, I hadn't had contact with Leafy since early 2018,

41:51.600 --> 41:55.600
and that conversation consisted of, let Billy the fridge and clown know you're okay.

41:55.600 --> 42:03.600
It was kind of a shock to hear from him, because I had been convinced that he was probably gone for good at that point.

42:03.600 --> 42:09.600
You know, it's funny with me and Leafy, or Leafy and I I should say, I didn't know exactly how he felt about me,

42:09.600 --> 42:15.600
and when he had some of his personal photos leaked, he switched a lot of his Skype around,

42:15.600 --> 42:21.600
and he made sure that the changes that he made, that I was aware of all of them, so I could continue to contact him.

42:21.600 --> 42:28.600
So I'm pretty sure that while we're not the closest of friends by any stretch, that we generally enjoy our conversations.

42:28.600 --> 42:33.600
How would you describe your relationship with Leafy? Would you consider yourself friends?

42:33.600 --> 42:38.600
Well, to put it, if Leafy asked me to help him out with something, I certainly would do it.

42:38.600 --> 42:43.600
Again, we're not the closest of friends. I would consider us internet friends.

42:43.600 --> 42:51.600
We've had several well over an hour conversations. I find him to be fascinating on his take of the world.

42:51.600 --> 42:55.600
He's exceptionally bright, very quick, and hungry for knowledge.

42:55.600 --> 43:00.600
And I don't say that to sort of pump sunshine up his ass. That's generally who he is.

43:00.600 --> 43:04.600
He generally enjoys engaging conversations.

43:04.600 --> 43:09.600
But to sum it up, yeah, I think me and Leafy are internet friends. I don't know if it goes much farther than that.

43:09.600 --> 43:16.600
I would imagine him and Grade and Billy and Colossal's crazy. I think they would consider themselves friends.

43:16.600 --> 43:19.600
I'm more of a guy that he likes to chat with once in a while, to be fair.

43:19.600 --> 43:23.600
Summarize what Leafy told you with regard to his decline.

43:23.600 --> 43:29.600
I can't say we had too many conversations about this, because it would have been an uncomfortable topic.

43:29.600 --> 43:32.600
It's not something I would have brought up. I mean, I know what it's like to decline.

43:32.600 --> 43:36.600
I know what it's like to be minus on Social Blade. It's not something we would talk about.

43:36.600 --> 43:43.600
We'd probably more talk about esports. We got a big conversation about Quake one time, which we're both fans of.

43:43.600 --> 43:54.600
But he did seem to suggest something that you put in your video, that he was somewhat suspicious about YouTube hiding his channel.

43:54.600 --> 43:59.600
Or doing something to his channel to make it less available based on some of the statistics that he saw.

43:59.600 --> 44:05.600
But he was honest with the fact that he wasn't quite sure how they were doing it.

44:05.600 --> 44:10.600
And then amusingly, he said, although I do think he was being very literal.

44:10.600 --> 44:15.600
Amusingly, he said that if I were them, I would block me or I would hide.

44:15.600 --> 44:21.600
What he actually said was, if I were them, I would get rid of me too.

44:21.600 --> 44:26.600
Which I thought was really amusing, but I think he meant it quite literally from a business perspective.

44:26.600 --> 44:31.600
In other words, if he owned YouTube, he would not have somebody like him on the platform.

44:31.600 --> 44:36.600
After personally speaking with Leafy, what are your impressions on Overhaul's attitude and mental state?

44:36.600 --> 44:40.600
Was there more to him than what showed on YouTube?

44:40.600 --> 44:45.600
Absolutely. Well, I could say without a shadow of a doubt.

44:45.600 --> 44:47.600
I know a lot of people are worried about Leafy.

44:47.600 --> 44:50.600
And obviously it would be the way he just kind of ghosted.

44:50.600 --> 44:53.600
He ghosted a lot of his friends and really didn't let them know what was going on.

44:54.600 --> 45:01.600
But I can say without any reservation whatsoever that Leafy is more than mentally healthy, happy.

45:01.600 --> 45:06.600
He is irritated about what YouTube has become.

45:06.600 --> 45:11.600
But he kind of hinted that there's been other endeavors outside of YouTube.

45:11.600 --> 45:18.600
He told me, I mean he said I could be 100% honest, that he was quite wealthy prior to his explosion on YouTube.

45:18.600 --> 45:22.600
I don't think that his mental state is anything to be concerned about.

45:22.600 --> 45:28.600
I think Leafy is quite happy with his girlfriend and quite happy with his life.

45:28.600 --> 45:33.600
His attitude overall, again, he's upset about the changes in YouTube.

45:33.600 --> 45:34.600
Like most of us are.

45:34.600 --> 45:37.600
But I think it sickens him more than it does me.

45:37.600 --> 45:39.600
He was there in the golden age.

45:39.600 --> 45:42.600
And he expressed frustrations like I don't even know how you do it anymore because...

45:42.600 --> 45:47.600
In fact, he expressed embarrassment about the criticisms that he made of YouTube in 2015 and 2016.

45:47.600 --> 45:51.600
And looking at YouTube now, and it almost seems like there were ridiculous criticisms

45:51.600 --> 45:54.600
because it's so much more difficult to make a living.

45:54.600 --> 45:59.600
And he is really aware that there would be no Leafy in 2018.

45:59.600 --> 46:00.600
Or 17 for that matter.

46:00.600 --> 46:03.600
He's irritated about the state of YouTube.

46:03.600 --> 46:05.600
It's not what it was.

46:05.600 --> 46:07.600
He had problems with YouTube back in the day.

46:07.600 --> 46:12.600
But he's kind of looked back at that and seen like, wow, it was a much better place back then.

46:12.600 --> 46:15.600
And I think we all agree on that.

46:15.600 --> 46:22.600
Do I personally agree with the theory that YouTube intentionally sabotaged Leafy's channel?

46:22.600 --> 46:26.600
Look, when it was first suggested to me, and I actually can remember the date.

46:26.600 --> 46:30.600
It was about February 2017 when it was first suggested to me.

46:30.600 --> 46:33.600
But like I said before, it was kind of in a casual way.

46:33.600 --> 46:35.600
But I do think Leafy was being literal about it.

46:35.600 --> 46:38.600
After watching your video, I'm getting there.

46:38.600 --> 46:40.600
But I'm not 100% sure.

46:40.600 --> 46:43.600
Yeah, but I'm getting there and I do believe Leafy believes that.

46:43.600 --> 46:48.600
But would I be shocked if your video and Leafy's theory was 100% on?

46:48.600 --> 46:50.600
No, not at all.

46:50.600 --> 46:55.600
Especially with what I've seen with my own videos and own podcasts.

46:55.600 --> 46:57.600
And now that everything's being...

46:57.600 --> 46:59.600
I don't even think there's an algorithm anymore.

46:59.600 --> 47:01.600
I think there's just automatic demonetization.

47:01.600 --> 47:02.600
I'm getting there.

47:02.600 --> 47:04.600
There's certainly something to it.

47:04.600 --> 47:07.600
How did I react to the Leafy content cop?

47:07.600 --> 47:09.600
Did you ever consider defending him?

47:09.600 --> 47:11.600
No, not at all.

47:11.600 --> 47:14.600
Although I've changed dramatically in my views of YouTube

47:14.600 --> 47:16.600
and the way I conduct myself.

47:16.600 --> 47:18.600
When I was invited on the Baited podcast from Keem,

47:18.600 --> 47:20.600
Keem was my guy.

47:20.600 --> 47:23.600
I was going to get this horrible person that I never met.

47:23.600 --> 47:26.600
I'm going to get him back. I'm going to get him off the platform.

47:26.600 --> 47:27.600
I'm going to embarrass him.

47:27.600 --> 47:29.600
I'm going to fuck him up with my own podcast.

47:29.600 --> 47:32.600
Some of my biggest podcasts had Leafy in the title,

47:32.600 --> 47:34.600
where I was heavily critical of him.

47:34.600 --> 47:37.600
When the content cop came out, I laughed ridiculously.

47:37.600 --> 47:39.600
I still think it's the best one as far as entertainment perspective.

47:39.600 --> 47:41.600
That's just my personal opinion.

47:41.600 --> 47:46.600
But I was a very different YouTuber, for lack of a better word, back then.

47:46.600 --> 47:50.600
And I was consumed in an environment of revenge,

47:50.600 --> 47:52.600
revenge that wasn't even mine to take.

47:52.600 --> 47:56.600
But I viewed Keemstar as a victim, and in some ways he was,

47:56.600 --> 48:00.600
and somebody that gave me a little glimpse of internet fame.

48:00.600 --> 48:05.600
And I was going to do absolutely everything in my power to damage Leafy.

48:05.600 --> 48:07.600
I don't feel that way anymore.

48:07.600 --> 48:10.600
I've since learned that you have to produce content

48:10.600 --> 48:13.600
other than revenge content or drama content.

48:13.600 --> 48:14.600
People will leave you.

48:14.600 --> 48:16.600
If that's all you have to offer the world,

48:16.600 --> 48:18.600
then it's just like you're just an angry dude.

48:18.600 --> 48:20.600
And I think I've succeeded in that, and I've turned things around a lot.

48:20.600 --> 48:22.600
But it was sort of a hard lesson to learn.

48:22.600 --> 48:24.600
And I remember I was talking to Leafy,

48:24.600 --> 48:28.600
and he was talking about somebody who had made a criticism of him.

48:28.600 --> 48:30.600
I usually call this the teenage girl defense.

48:30.600 --> 48:31.600
You don't even know me.

48:31.600 --> 48:33.600
It does irritate him, and he's right about this,

48:33.600 --> 48:37.600
that you can sort of psychoanalyze somebody on YouTube,

48:37.600 --> 48:39.600
never front of them, never talk to them,

48:39.600 --> 48:42.600
and never really do any other research

48:42.600 --> 48:44.600
than what's already available on the internet,

48:44.600 --> 48:49.600
and come with these sort of scathing character summaries,

48:49.600 --> 48:51.600
sort of analyze a person in a way

48:51.600 --> 48:55.600
where you sort of are projecting that you know who they are.

48:55.600 --> 48:56.600
And I think that's right.

48:56.600 --> 48:59.600
Meeting Leafy for the first time, it was a strange thing

48:59.600 --> 49:01.600
because I was so bred to hate his guts.

49:01.600 --> 49:05.600
And he first approached me prior to the Baited podcast breaking up.

49:05.600 --> 49:07.600
I was very charmed by him.

49:07.600 --> 49:09.600
I found him interesting, intelligent,

49:09.600 --> 49:13.600
not to mention the fact that he was one of the more powerful YouTubers at that time.

49:13.600 --> 49:16.600
It was sort of just after the Nick Cash thing,

49:16.600 --> 49:20.600
and it wasn't quite assured that this was his downfall at this point.

49:20.600 --> 49:24.600
You know, this is the guy that was in some days out averaging PewDiePie on subs.

49:24.600 --> 49:26.600
Yeah, it was overwhelming.

49:26.600 --> 49:28.600
And even after he started to dip,

49:28.600 --> 49:32.600
I still saw him as a fascinating character

49:32.600 --> 49:34.600
and a fascinating personality.

49:34.600 --> 49:35.600
I still do.

49:35.600 --> 49:37.600
He is extremely charming,

49:37.600 --> 49:39.600
extremely intelligent,

49:39.600 --> 49:41.600
and extremely interesting.

49:41.600 --> 49:43.600
Going back to what you said before that,

49:43.600 --> 49:45.600
I don't think I properly answered,

49:45.600 --> 49:47.600
is he different than what he shows on YouTube?

49:47.600 --> 49:48.600
Absolutely.

49:48.600 --> 49:51.600
I think he's a person with a hell of a lot of depth,

49:51.600 --> 49:53.600
despite the fact that he never went to college

49:53.600 --> 49:55.600
and grew up rather poor.

49:55.600 --> 50:00.600
Do you think that Leafy deserved all the hate and punishment he received?

50:00.600 --> 50:02.600
No, looking back,

50:02.600 --> 50:05.600
but I wouldn't have said that back then.

50:05.600 --> 50:06.600
I do believe,

50:06.600 --> 50:07.600
and by the way, Leafy agrees with this well,

50:07.600 --> 50:11.600
that he put himself in a position to receive this kind of hate.

50:11.600 --> 50:12.600
We both agree on that.

50:12.600 --> 50:14.600
The videos that he made on kids,

50:14.600 --> 50:16.600
I could never, ever, ever support them in any manner.

50:16.600 --> 50:18.600
I still find them disgusting to this day

50:18.600 --> 50:21.600
that he would pick random children and just kind of like goof on them.

50:21.600 --> 50:23.600
I mean, of course, we all make cringey videos when we're kids.

50:23.600 --> 50:25.600
Now there's this whole social media outlet.

50:25.600 --> 50:27.600
You know, you just don't do it on your camcorder anymore

50:27.600 --> 50:28.600
like you did when I was a kid.

50:28.600 --> 50:30.600
It's for the whole world to see.

50:30.600 --> 50:31.600
But that being said,

50:31.600 --> 50:33.600
it was just so funny after the Content Cop.

50:33.600 --> 50:38.600
And then I don't even think the Content Cop was as damaging as the Nick Cash reveal.

50:38.600 --> 50:41.600
I think that was the final nail in the coffin, not the Content Cop.

50:41.600 --> 50:44.600
The Content Cop gave permission for everybody to sort of come out

50:44.600 --> 50:47.600
and say how Leafy had treated him in the past.

50:47.600 --> 50:48.600
And then if you also remember,

50:48.600 --> 50:51.600
after Nick Cash came out, there was a whole slew of other stuff.

50:51.600 --> 50:54.600
Once the seal was broken or the floodgates were open, the flood came in.

50:54.600 --> 50:57.600
No, I don't even think all the criticisms were right on.

50:57.600 --> 50:59.600
And the thing is, you liked Leafy so much.

50:59.600 --> 51:00.600
You were willing to work with Leafy.

51:00.600 --> 51:02.600
You were willing to do all this stuff

51:02.600 --> 51:05.600
and willing to look the other way when he did make questionable things.

51:05.600 --> 51:07.600
And now all of a sudden, he's the worst guy in the world.

51:07.600 --> 51:09.600
And Keemstar's a good guy?

51:09.600 --> 51:13.600
No, I think it's like most situations on YouTube.

51:13.600 --> 51:15.600
Everybody snaked each other.

51:15.600 --> 51:18.600
And I don't know if anybody's any worse than any character.

51:18.600 --> 51:20.600
And you could throw me in this pile as well.

51:20.600 --> 51:23.600
I've had to kind of soul search a bit for my role in this.

51:23.600 --> 51:25.600
I think we were all a bunch of rats and snakes,

51:25.600 --> 51:28.600
thinking of ourselves, thinking about doing each other,

51:28.600 --> 51:34.600
only thinking of fame and more internet fame and boosting our profiles.

51:34.600 --> 51:37.600
And I'm for one glad that I kind of got out of that way of thinking

51:37.600 --> 51:39.600
for my own sanity.

51:39.600 --> 51:42.600
But no, I think nobody deserves all the hate they get.

51:42.600 --> 51:44.600
Leafy's a human being.

51:44.600 --> 51:46.600
He deserved what he got.

51:46.600 --> 51:48.600
But you could always point to a few examples

51:48.600 --> 51:50.600
where it's just way over the top.

51:50.600 --> 51:52.600
What do you think that Leafy's doing now?

51:52.600 --> 51:54.600
Do you think he will return to YouTube?

51:54.600 --> 51:58.600
And if so, do you think he will ever overcome the hate?

51:58.600 --> 52:00.600
What do you think Leafy is doing now?

52:00.600 --> 52:02.600
Well, he did give me permission to speak frankly.

52:02.600 --> 52:06.600
I can tell you that he's working, not in a fast food joint.

52:06.600 --> 52:10.600
He's still very much the entrepreneur that I met in 2016.

52:10.600 --> 52:12.600
Will he return to YouTube?

52:12.600 --> 52:17.600
Well, I can tell you that he has floated the idea of making content again.

52:17.600 --> 52:19.600
And more of the sense that he'd try it,

52:19.600 --> 52:21.600
but he is very irritated by the state of YouTube.

52:21.600 --> 52:23.600
It's just simply not fun for him anymore.

52:23.600 --> 52:25.600
You've got to understand with Leafy,

52:25.600 --> 52:27.600
and I think that's why he put himself in a bad situation.

52:27.600 --> 52:29.600
He's a gamer, a hardcore gamer.

52:29.600 --> 52:32.600
Can you say that anymore? Does that make me sound old?

52:32.600 --> 52:35.600
No, he loves gaming. He loves eSports.

52:35.600 --> 52:37.600
He really is passionate about eSports.

52:37.600 --> 52:40.600
So that passion that he had for YouTube

52:40.600 --> 52:43.600
was probably the same for eSports as far as producing content,

52:43.600 --> 52:46.600
but I don't think it's the same passion that me and you have.

52:46.600 --> 52:48.600
Making the perfect video.

52:48.600 --> 52:50.600
I mean, if you ever played Pac-Man,

52:50.600 --> 52:53.600
the only word to determine the better player is who has the most points.

52:53.600 --> 52:55.600
And for him, hits were the most points.

52:55.600 --> 52:58.600
And I don't think that he finds that very interesting anymore.

52:58.600 --> 53:02.600
Not because... I don't necessarily think because it's great.

53:02.600 --> 53:05.600
And I think a lot of his closest friends would disagree with me on this.

53:05.600 --> 53:08.600
I think it's because he enjoys the game so much.

53:08.600 --> 53:10.600
I mean, he certainly doesn't need any more money.

53:10.600 --> 53:12.600
We're talking about a 20-year-old millionaire.

53:12.600 --> 53:14.600
And now he's 22.

53:14.600 --> 53:16.600
And I don't think much of... I'm sure it's all in good places.

53:16.600 --> 53:19.600
Leafy's not the type of guy to go out and just blow all his money

53:19.600 --> 53:21.600
or do something insanely insane.

53:21.600 --> 53:24.600
And from what I understand, he lives,

53:24.600 --> 53:26.600
I wouldn't even say relatively humble, small.

53:26.600 --> 53:28.600
That's the way he is.

53:28.600 --> 53:30.600
He said that he thought about it, but he's just simply not passionate.

53:30.600 --> 53:33.600
You may see one more video about Leafy.

53:33.600 --> 53:36.600
It wouldn't shock me if he acted like he was never away.

53:36.600 --> 53:39.600
Like, hey guys, sorry I've been away for a while,

53:39.600 --> 53:41.600
but check out this kid right here.

53:41.600 --> 53:43.600
I could totally see that happening.

53:43.600 --> 53:46.600
I totally could, but he's not passionate about it because it's not the same.

53:46.600 --> 53:49.600
If I could make a gaming comparison,

53:49.600 --> 53:53.600
Quake 3 was a staple of esports in its day,

53:53.600 --> 53:56.600
and then Quake 4 came out and nobody liked it,

53:56.600 --> 53:58.600
and it wasn't really a staple of esports.

53:58.600 --> 54:01.600
I think that's the difference between 2016 and 2017.

54:01.600 --> 54:03.600
And that's the way. It's just not fun.

54:03.600 --> 54:05.600
He's well off. I don't think it's about money.

54:05.600 --> 54:07.600
That's just the bonus.

54:07.600 --> 54:09.600
I think it's about the high score.

54:09.600 --> 54:11.600
And I think the way he sees it, he was champ.

54:11.600 --> 54:12.600
He won this game.

54:12.600 --> 54:14.600
And yeah, he could get back in it,

54:14.600 --> 54:16.600
but it's not the same game that he was playing before,

54:16.600 --> 54:17.600
so he's not that interesting.

54:17.600 --> 54:20.600
I remember saying that Nerd City thinks that daily content

54:20.600 --> 54:23.600
is actually being rejected by the algorithm,

54:23.600 --> 54:26.600
so he said something to me to the effect of,

54:26.600 --> 54:28.600
I could never do the daily grind again.

54:28.600 --> 54:30.600
And I said, that's great because the daily grind

54:30.600 --> 54:31.600
actually might hurt you in the algorithm.

54:31.600 --> 54:33.600
I told him what Nerd City had told me.

54:33.600 --> 54:35.600
And he's like, really?

54:35.600 --> 54:37.600
And I started to realize that he's really been out of it

54:37.600 --> 54:39.600
as far as being engaged in YouTube,

54:39.600 --> 54:41.600
like content creators like you and me are.

54:41.600 --> 54:43.600
That seems so foreign to him

54:43.600 --> 54:45.600
that you didn't have to do the daily grind.

54:45.600 --> 54:47.600
And it turned him off.

54:47.600 --> 54:49.600
And he even said that it made him angry

54:49.600 --> 54:51.600
because that's what I think he liked doing.

54:51.600 --> 54:53.600
He liked hustling and he liked getting the high score.

54:53.600 --> 54:55.600
And now the rules have changed as such

54:55.600 --> 54:57.600
where it doesn't favor his strategy.

54:57.600 --> 54:58.600
And I don't think that's an insult.

54:58.600 --> 54:59.600
I think that's a fact.

54:59.600 --> 55:00.600
I think actually he would agree with me.

55:00.600 --> 55:02.600
And how can I say it's all not about money?

55:02.600 --> 55:03.600
No, I think it's the number.

55:03.600 --> 55:05.600
Some of us get off by getting the high score,

55:05.600 --> 55:07.600
whether we get rewarded by money or not.

55:07.600 --> 55:08.600
Everybody likes money,

55:08.600 --> 55:12.600
but I do think that it's an extremely competitive nature.

55:12.600 --> 55:14.600
Leave this type of guy to play Monopoly

55:14.600 --> 55:17.600
and make sure he has everything locked up,

55:17.600 --> 55:19.600
every house, and wins every deal.

55:19.600 --> 55:21.600
And I think that's the key to his success.

55:21.600 --> 55:23.600
Do I ever think he will overcome the hate?

55:23.600 --> 55:25.600
I think everybody has a chance to overcome hate.

55:25.600 --> 55:27.600
It just depends on how you present yourself.

55:27.600 --> 55:29.600
Do I know how or what the key to that is?

55:29.600 --> 55:31.600
My suggestion to him was a while ago.

55:31.600 --> 55:32.600
I don't know if he heard me a lot.

55:32.600 --> 55:33.600
It was over a year ago.

55:33.600 --> 55:36.600
Come out as Calvin, not LeafyIsHere.

55:36.600 --> 55:38.600
I think Calvin's way more interested in Leafy.

55:38.600 --> 55:39.600
He's insight on the world.

55:39.600 --> 55:43.600
He mentioned to me about writing a book about young people,

55:43.600 --> 55:44.600
very young people,

55:44.600 --> 55:46.600
receiving large sums of money for their work

55:46.600 --> 55:47.600
and how it affects them.

55:47.600 --> 55:48.600
That would be interesting to me.

55:48.600 --> 55:50.600
That would make excellent videos.

55:50.600 --> 55:52.600
I don't know if his fan base is ready for that,

55:52.600 --> 55:53.600
but it might bring on a new one.

55:53.600 --> 55:55.600
You know, we saw poods kind of grow

55:55.600 --> 55:58.600
from a child entertainer to something more interesting.

55:58.600 --> 56:00.600
I think Leafy's capable of that himself.

56:00.600 --> 56:01.600
I don't know if he knows it.

56:01.600 --> 56:03.600
Skype Leafy, depending on the presentation,

56:03.600 --> 56:05.600
I don't know exactly how he should do it, would be,

56:05.600 --> 56:07.600
for me, a lot more interesting.

56:07.600 --> 56:10.600
Will it ever garner the hits that he once had?

56:10.600 --> 56:13.600
Would it ever garner the growth that he once had?

56:13.600 --> 56:14.600
Probably not.

56:14.600 --> 56:16.600
But it would definitely,

56:16.600 --> 56:18.600
I think it would definitely bring him a different audience,

56:18.600 --> 56:20.600
and he definitely could be relevant again.

56:20.600 --> 56:22.600
And by that, yeah, then he could overcome the hate

56:22.600 --> 56:24.600
because he has a completely new crowd

56:24.600 --> 56:26.600
and enough times went by.

56:26.600 --> 56:28.600
Has Leafy changed since he left YouTube?

56:28.600 --> 56:30.600
No, I don't think so.

56:30.600 --> 56:32.600
I don't think so. He seems like the same guy to me.

56:32.600 --> 56:33.600
He's a complicated dude.

56:33.600 --> 56:35.600
I don't fully understand him.

56:35.600 --> 56:36.600
He's very private.

56:36.600 --> 56:39.600
Whenever we've gotten into personal conversations,

56:39.600 --> 56:40.600
he kind of skirts them.

56:40.600 --> 56:42.600
He talks about gaming. He talks about YouTube.

56:42.600 --> 56:43.600
He talks about business.

56:43.600 --> 56:45.600
Leafy talks about, you know, what he's interested in.

56:45.600 --> 56:47.600
He's passionate about it, really passionate about it.

56:47.600 --> 56:49.600
I just remember, I keep on bringing up Quake.

56:49.600 --> 56:50.600
I mean, I remember when he says,

56:50.600 --> 56:53.600
you played Quake back in the day?

56:53.600 --> 56:55.600
And I was like, yeah, I did.

56:55.600 --> 56:58.600
That area of like 1995 to 1999

56:58.600 --> 57:01.600
was like a golden esports age to him, you know,

57:01.600 --> 57:03.600
that he wasn't around for because he was younger.

57:03.600 --> 57:05.600
I don't know if he was that bad to begin with.

57:05.600 --> 57:06.600
Would his content change?

57:06.600 --> 57:08.600
Maybe. Probably not. I don't know.

57:08.600 --> 57:10.600
We're only talking about two years of time here.

57:10.600 --> 57:12.600
You know, he's 20 and now he's 22.

57:12.600 --> 57:13.600
So no, I don't think he's changed much at all.

57:13.600 --> 57:15.600
Does he regret his YouTube career?

57:15.600 --> 57:17.600
Absolutely not. I think he feels he won.

57:17.600 --> 57:19.600
He was world champ. He was defeated.

57:19.600 --> 57:21.600
He won the game and then he lost the game.

57:21.600 --> 57:23.600
He was Mike Tyson for a while.

57:23.600 --> 57:24.600
And then he lost.

57:24.600 --> 57:26.600
No big deal. He's a gamer.

57:26.600 --> 57:27.600
Pick up a new game.

57:27.600 --> 57:28.600
And I think that's what he did.

57:28.600 --> 57:30.600
No, I don't think he has any regrets whatsoever.

57:30.600 --> 57:32.600
I don't think Leafy has too many regrets in life.

57:32.600 --> 57:34.600
There's a lot of unseemly things about him

57:34.600 --> 57:36.600
and there's a lot of unseemly things that he's done on YouTube.

57:36.600 --> 57:38.600
And I've mentioned them in the past,

57:38.600 --> 57:42.600
but I think that really it boils down to the gamer that he is.

57:42.600 --> 57:44.600
The people that are on my news team

57:44.600 --> 57:45.600
and help my channel and work for me,

57:45.600 --> 57:47.600
I see them as friends even though I might not have stood

57:47.600 --> 57:48.600
in front of all of them at some time.

57:48.600 --> 57:51.600
And I think ColossusCrazy feels this way as well.

57:51.600 --> 57:54.600
You're not friends until you shake hands, go out,

57:54.600 --> 57:56.600
have a couple beers and know each other.

57:56.600 --> 57:59.600
So I think sometimes, oh, this is not excusing his behavior.

57:59.600 --> 58:01.600
I think he sees Nick Cash, Elvis the Alien,

58:01.600 --> 58:03.600
and it does sound cold.

58:03.600 --> 58:07.600
Me, Keemstar, great A under A, or maybe not great,

58:07.600 --> 58:11.600
great he's close with as, you know, they're gamers

58:11.600 --> 58:13.600
and he's there to beat them.

58:13.600 --> 58:15.600
And I think that sometimes he doesn't recognize

58:15.600 --> 58:17.600
that there's people behind that avatar.

58:17.600 --> 58:19.600
And if I could defend him on that,

58:19.600 --> 58:21.600
I think that has a lot to do with his age.

58:21.600 --> 58:24.600
I think it has a lot to do with the fact that he never had kids.

58:24.600 --> 58:28.600
I think it has a lot to do with that Leafy had a difficult upbringing.

58:28.600 --> 58:31.600
That was one of the biggest embarrassments that I had

58:31.600 --> 58:32.600
when I was attacking him.

58:32.600 --> 58:36.600
I actually, and considering recent events, this is kind of funny.

58:36.600 --> 58:40.600
I attacked him with information that I got from Michael McCrudden,

58:40.600 --> 58:42.600
which is all wrong, of course.

58:42.600 --> 58:43.600
And I remember I said something to them.

58:43.600 --> 58:46.600
I mentioned this embarrassing moment, this attack that I used,

58:46.600 --> 58:47.600
and I asked him if it was true.

58:47.600 --> 58:49.600
And he says, where did you hear that from?

58:49.600 --> 58:53.600
And it didn't really make me realize that he's a human being.

58:53.600 --> 58:56.600
And it also made me realize that I was getting way too caught up in this shit.

58:56.600 --> 59:00.600
You know how people say they don't give a fuck?

59:00.600 --> 59:03.600
And you know when they're repeating it over and over again that they do?

59:03.600 --> 59:06.600
Leafy really doesn't give a fuck.

59:06.600 --> 59:10.600
I mean, all the horrible things that I said about him and his family

59:10.600 --> 59:14.600
and the horrible things that I was willing to do to lower myself,

59:14.600 --> 59:17.600
to get even with him, to help my hero Keemstar,

59:17.600 --> 59:18.600
it's embarrassing.

59:18.600 --> 59:20.600
Leafy's just a guy. He's just like you and me.

59:20.600 --> 59:22.600
He's flawed. He's a little cold.

59:22.600 --> 59:27.600
But he's fascinating and he's successful and he'll always be a YouTube legend.

59:27.600 --> 59:30.600
And that's LeafyIsHere.

59:30.600 --> 59:32.600
And I hope he does come back.

59:32.600 --> 59:34.600
I'd be interested to see what he would do.

59:34.600 --> 59:38.600
Well, everyone, that's probably the best testimony we're going to get

59:38.600 --> 59:43.600
from someone who was close to Leafy and has spoken to Leafy very recently.

59:43.600 --> 59:46.600
So once again, a big shout out to Tommy C.

59:46.600 --> 59:49.600
You can check out his channel below, link in the description.

59:49.600 --> 59:51.600
And that's about it for now.

59:51.600 --> 59:55.600
I hope that this video has given some of you guys some closure about LeafyIsHere.

59:55.600 --> 59:58.600
Some of you might say that I'm milking the subject,

59:58.600 --> 01:00:01.600
but that's never really been my intention.

01:00:01.600 --> 01:00:05.600
For me, the truth is that this is just a very interesting topic.

01:00:05.600 --> 01:00:09.600
My goal for making this video, as well as the original Leafy video,

01:00:09.600 --> 01:00:12.600
is to tackle some of these unanswered questions.

01:00:12.600 --> 01:00:15.600
It boils down to the simple fact that Leafy had a huge following

01:00:15.600 --> 01:00:17.600
and he just disappeared.

01:00:17.600 --> 01:00:21.600
And I feel like people have a right to know at least some of what happened.

01:00:21.600 --> 01:00:23.600
So for those of you who are still watching at this point,

01:00:23.600 --> 01:00:26.600
thanks for tuning in. I'll catch you in the next one.
