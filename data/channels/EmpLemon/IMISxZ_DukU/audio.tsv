0	13260	In 1999, a new animated series called Family Guy debuted on the Fox Network.
13260	17500	The show based much of its comedy on referential humor and recurring jokes, including one in
17500	19940	which Peter Griffin falls and hurts his knee.
19940	23820	Nineteen years later, this joke has re-emerged in a completely transformed society where
23820	27260	referential humor and recurring jokes dominate internet culture.
27480	31180	Family Guy as a TV show has always been a more edgy and less popular alternative to
31180	34400	The Simpsons, and the same dynamic applies to memes.
34400	38420	While Simpsons shitposting has found great success all over the web, ironic Family Guy
38420	42800	memes have been slowly building a cult following within fringe communities, but they have never
42800	45620	seen widespread use until now.
45620	49800	While this specific meme is still limited compared to something like Steamed Hams, it
49800	54240	has managed to spawn some wickedly creative edits, and I'm very interested to see where
54240	57160	Family Guy goes as a meme source in the future.
57160	61020	It's somewhat fitting to see that even after their heyday on television, Family Guy and
61020	64780	The Simpsons are still destined to be rivals, even in meme form.
