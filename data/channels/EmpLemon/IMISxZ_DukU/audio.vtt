In 1999, a new animated series called Family Guy debuted on the Fox Network.

00:13.260 --> 00:17.500
The show based much of its comedy on referential humor and recurring jokes, including one in

00:17.500 --> 00:19.940
which Peter Griffin falls and hurts his knee.

00:19.940 --> 00:23.820
Nineteen years later, this joke has re-emerged in a completely transformed society where

00:23.820 --> 00:27.260
referential humor and recurring jokes dominate internet culture.

00:27.480 --> 00:31.180
Family Guy as a TV show has always been a more edgy and less popular alternative to

00:31.180 --> 00:34.400
The Simpsons, and the same dynamic applies to memes.

00:34.400 --> 00:38.420
While Simpsons shitposting has found great success all over the web, ironic Family Guy

00:38.420 --> 00:42.800
memes have been slowly building a cult following within fringe communities, but they have never

00:42.800 --> 00:45.620
seen widespread use until now.

00:45.620 --> 00:49.800
While this specific meme is still limited compared to something like Steamed Hams, it

00:49.800 --> 00:54.240
has managed to spawn some wickedly creative edits, and I'm very interested to see where

00:54.240 --> 00:57.160
Family Guy goes as a meme source in the future.

00:57.160 --> 01:01.020
It's somewhat fitting to see that even after their heyday on television, Family Guy and

01:01.020 --> 01:04.780
The Simpsons are still destined to be rivals, even in meme form.
