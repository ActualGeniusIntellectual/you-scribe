0	4600	In the last episode of this series, I talked about the appeal of professional wrestling,
4600	8200	a form of entertainment that disguises itself as a sport.
8200	14500	In this episode, I'm gonna talk about NASCAR, a sport which tries to disguise itself as entertaining.
14500	20800	Today, NASCAR's Monster Energy Cup series tours around the country racing in front of mostly empty arenas
20800	24000	as sponsorships and television ratings continue to wane.
24000	28000	At least with professional wrestling, while not many fans enjoy it anymore,
28100	32100	there's still at least a small nucleus of people that still care about it.
32100	37300	It's nearly impossible to find anyone these days who actually cares about NASCAR.
37300	42100	Hold on. I'm gonna give my best NASCAR noise impression.
42100	45700	Most people upon hearing the name NASCAR immediately think of a dumb sport
45700	49400	where dumb rednecks watch cars go around in circles,
49400	51400	but I'm here to tell you that's wrong.
51400	54500	The cars actually go around in ovals.
54500	58260	In all seriousness though, it ain't easy being a NASCAR fan.
58260	64700	It ain't easy having to constantly justify to people why you like something that's about as popular as licorice.
64700	69800	There was once a time when many more people liked NASCAR, but that time has long since passed.
69800	78500	The vacuous boredom often associated with the sport today has paradoxically created intrigue for reasons why anyone would even like it in the first place.
78500	84800	Trying to convince anybody to actually care about NASCAR is a pretty tall order, but that won't stop me from trying.
84800	95000	Because there's one driver in the sport's turbulent history that truly embodies all of the reasons why NASCAR was, at one time, the second most popular sport in America.
95000	98500	This is the story of Dale Earnhardt.
108500	123000	They call you son of business when I go. Let it blow, let it blow, let it blow, let it blow.
123000	135000	Many of my viewers like to draw comparisons between me and a writer by the name of John Boyce, and it's a pretty fair comparison, considering John Boyce is one of my biggest inspirations as a creator today.
135000	142500	Last Halloween, John wrote a short story about a pitcher who sells his soul to Satan and falls away from the earth in the middle of a baseball game.
142500	150000	While this story is clearly a work of fiction, it is eerily comparable to the real life and death of Dale Earnhardt.
150000	154300	Our story begins in the rural American town of Kannapolis, North Carolina.
154300	164000	Sometime in the late 1960s, a young Dale Earnhardt drops out of high school and uses what little money he has to start competing at locally sanctioned dirt track races.
164000	173500	Earnhardt most likely shares the same lofty, unobtainable pipe dream as all of his competitors to work his way up the ranks and eventually race in the top series of NASCAR.
173500	178500	NASCAR, like Dale Earnhardt, had its origins in the rural American South.
178500	188500	The roots of the sport can be traced back to the Prohibition era where moonshiners, attempting to smuggle barrelfuls of illegal whiskey, would tune up their cars to be able to outrun police.
188500	194000	When Prohibition ended in the 1930s, the smugglers were left with nothing to do but race each other.
194000	204000	Small, unsanctioned races began to take place all across the South, but perhaps no other place became a more popular racing destination than Daytona Beach, Florida.
204000	210500	The beaches of Daytona feature finely grained sand that forms a hard, compact surface ideal for auto racing.
210500	217000	In the early 20th century, automotive engineers would use the beaches of Daytona to try to break the land speed record.
217000	225000	Eventually, record attempts would migrate to the salt flats of Bonneville, Utah, leaving Daytona open for a new frontier of stock car racing.
230500	236000	Stock car racing differs greatly from other racing series such as IndyCar or Formula One.
236000	242500	These types of open-wheel racing feature expertly crafted machines specifically designed to maximize speed and handling.
242500	249500	While open-wheel machines require an impressive degree of skill and finesse to operate, their design also leaves them very fragile,
249500	256500	rendering them virtually unable to contact each other on the track, as even a slight tap can produce a scrapyard of wrecked race cars.
256500	262500	Because of this, open-wheel racers rarely ever touch, resulting in very clean and fluid racing.
262500	265500	Stock cars are pretty much the complete opposite.
265500	271000	It essentially asks the question of, what would happen if you bought a car from the dealership and started racing it?
271000	277500	Naturally, consumer grade cars are much more bulky and less aerodynamically dependent than their open-wheel counterparts.
277500	282000	This allows stock cars to take much more of a beating while still remaining competitive,
282000	287000	leading to a style of racing that is slower but much more durable and contact heavy.
287000	292000	It's a style of racing that started to become wildly popular in the American South.
292000	299000	And perhaps no other man was more responsible for the rise of American stock car racing than Bill France.
299000	304000	Bill France was a fan of stock car racing since the days of his youth in the Roarin' 20s,
304000	307500	where he would skip school to drive laps in his parents' Model T.
307500	313000	When the Great Depression struck, Big Bill would flee to Daytona with less than $100 to his name,
313000	317000	but he was able to stay afloat by racing cars on the beach.
317000	321000	Eventually, Bill France would transition from race driver to race promoter,
321000	326000	and on February 21st, 1948, he revolutionized American motorsports
326000	331500	by founding the National Association for Stock Car Auto Racing, NASCAR.
331500	338000	Before NASCAR, stock car racing mostly featured scattered and disorganized events with inconsistent rules.
338000	340500	With no major governing body to sanction races,
340500	345500	there was nothing stopping some promoters from just not paying drivers the winnings they were owed.
345500	350000	NASCAR changed all of this by organizing a unified schedule of racing events,
350000	355500	complete with a singular ruleset, championship point system, and guaranteed driver winnings.
355500	359500	NASCAR truly became the first legitimate stock car racing league in America,
359500	366000	and all of a sudden, the allure of earning fame and fortune through a life of racing began to attract drivers from far and wide.
366000	373500	One of these drivers was a young Ralph Earnhardt, who in 1953 started racing full-time in NASCAR's Sportsman series.
373500	379000	Ralph Earnhardt's talent on quarter-mile dirt tracks made him a regional racing star in the Carolinas,
379000	383000	and even won him the Sportsman series championship in 1956.
383000	388000	And even though he would use his racing talent to single-handedly lift himself out of poverty,
388000	392500	he surprisingly didn't wish the same destiny upon his son, Dale Earnhardt.
392500	396000	Both Ralph and Dale grew up in Kannapolis, North Carolina,
396000	400000	a town so rural that it wasn't even incorporated until 1984.
400000	404000	Before that, almost everyone born into this place had no way out.
404000	409500	Only Ralph Earnhardt's racing talent could save him from a lifelong career at the local cotton mill.
409500	416000	Dale Earnhardt saw his father as his greatest inspiration, and he saw racing as his only real ticket to success.
416000	421000	Ralph Earnhardt didn't want his son to race, despite his own talent in the sport.
421000	426000	Talent is a very rare thing. If everyone were talented, no one would be.
426000	429000	Ralph Earnhardt probably knew this, and if he had his way,
429000	434000	Dale Earnhardt would have quit racing to graduate high school and get a nice desk job in the big city.
434000	440000	He probably never expected his son to become one of the greatest drivers ever. He never lived to see it, either.
440000	445000	Just 20 years after he began racing full-time, Ralph Earnhardt died of a heart attack.
445000	451000	Dale Earnhardt could have followed his father's wishes, and if he did, he'd probably still be around today.
451000	454500	But instead, he chose to follow in his father's footsteps.
454500	461500	And in trying to prove to his late father that he belonged in a race car, Dale Earnhardt would accidentally become one of the best in the world.
461500	465500	Just six years later, he found himself at the crossroads of history.
472500	478500	Covering a city block a second in rush hour traffic. Take a look at that.
478500	486500	Earnhardt blazes back into the front of this group. There's Earnhardt, your leader. Out of Turn 4.
486500	493500	Even at the very beginning of Dale Earnhardt's rookie season in the NASCAR Winston Cup Series, his talent was undeniable.
493500	501500	For a moment, he found himself leading the 21st annual Daytona 500, which may have been the most important race in the history of NASCAR.
501500	507500	Daytona International Speedway is quite possibly the greatest arena ever constructed by man.
507500	513500	The scale of this place is difficult to describe, but let's just say it's big enough to be sunny on one end and stormy on the other.
513500	519500	This modern-day coliseum is the fruit of one of the most ambitious engineering projects of the 20th century,
519500	524500	conceived from the outrageous imagination of none other than Bill France.
524500	532500	After 20 years of watching sloppy races on the beach, Bill France sought to construct a racetrack where drivers would never have to let off the throttle.
532500	537500	The result was a 2.5-mile-long tri-oval surrounded by a 31-degree embankment.
537500	544500	The sheer size of these corners is downright intimidating. It looks like you'd have a hard time walking up them, let alone driving on them.
544500	555500	The mere architecture of this place boggles the mind today, so you could only imagine the amazement of the 42,000 spectators who witnessed the inaugural running of the Daytona 500.
555500	563500	The pure spectacle of almost 60 stock cars barreling around an asphalt bowl at 135 miles per hour was something that no one had ever seen before.
563500	571500	And after an unforgettable photo finish, the Daytona 500 immediately established itself as the most prestigious event on the NASCAR schedule.
571500	577500	For every stock car driver in America, a win at Daytona is the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
577500	583500	At the time of its opening in 1959, Daytona International Speedway was the largest track of its kind.
583500	588500	Ten years later, Bill France would build an even bigger one in Talladega, Alabama.
588500	597500	And while Talladega Super Speedway would also go on to be very popular with fans, it would not displace the Daytona 500 as NASCAR's crown jewel event.
597500	604500	And that's why in 1979, CBS elected to broadcast the full race live in front of a national audience.
604500	611500	It would be the first live broadcast of an entire 500-mile motorsports event in the history of American television.
611500	615500	NASCAR found itself in a perfect storm of circumstances, quite literally.
615500	622500	As on the day of the race, a blizzard left most of the eastern U.S. stuck indoors with nothing to do but watch the Daytona 500.
622500	626500	An estimated 15 million viewers tuned into this race.
626500	631500	And for a brief moment, some of them got to see an unknown driver by the name of Dale Earnhardt leading the race.
631500	640500	While his father dominated on short tracks, Dale Earnhardt would find his greatest success on the big ones, even though they would also provide him with his greatest turmoil.
640500	646500	He didn't know it at the time, nor did anybody else watching, but Dale Earnhardt was cursed.
646500	651500	This is the story of a person and a place, a racer's relationship with a racetrack.
651500	656500	This was merely the first chapter of Dale vs. Daytona.
656500	660500	Earnhardt would go on to finish eighth out of 41 drivers in this race.
660500	664500	Not bad for his very first attempt at NASCAR's most coveted prize.
664500	673500	Dale Earnhardt's rookie effort would be reduced to an afterthought, however, as everyone's attention was instead drawn to perhaps the greatest finish in the history of NASCAR.
694500	706500	Out in front, Darryl Waltrip is in second, A.J. Boyd is in third, here they come, Waltrip trying to slingshot, Petty is out in front, at the line, Waltrip, Petty Wilson.
706500	715500	And here comes a $60,000 car becoming a 22-passenger school bus to bring his crew to Victory Lane.
715500	725500	And there's a fight between Caley Armbro and Donny Allison. The tempers overflowing, they're angry, they know they have lost, and what a bitter defeat.
725500	733500	In just a matter of minutes, the television audience got to experience dramatic racing, a crash, an unforgettable last lap pass,
733500	740500	NASCAR's most iconic driver setting an unbreakable record, and a bare-knuckle fistfight, all on live TV.
740500	745500	All of a sudden, the colloquial regional sport of NASCAR found itself with a national audience.
745500	751500	The finish made it all the way to the front page of the New York Times sports section, and NASCAR would never be the same.
751500	757500	The 1979 season saw Dale Earnhardt capture his first career win in just his 16th start.
757500	767500	He would win the Rookie of the Year award for that season and go on to finish seventh in the overall standings in a year where Richard Petty won his seventh and final Winston Cup championship.
767500	773500	At this point in time, Richard Petty is unanimously regarded as the greatest driver in the history of the sport.
773500	777500	Looking at it today, his career statistics seem almost mythical.
777500	788500	Petty's 200 career victories are almost double the next driver on NASCAR's all-time win list, and his seven series championships were, at the time, more than double any other driver.
788500	796500	After the 1979 season, the mere notion of any other driver challenging Petty's throne as the greatest of all time was laughable.
796500	801500	But if anyone were to do it, it would have to be a driver the likes of which no one had ever seen.
817500	825500	In 1980, Dale Earnhardt shocked everyone by winning the Winston Cup Series championship in just his second full-time season.
825500	829500	He was only the 15th different driver to achieve the title of NASCAR champion.
829500	838500	Already in his young career, Dale Earnhardt had joined some elite company, but he would soon learn that even when you're great, you're still a long way from the best.
838500	848500	Although he began with one of the greatest starts to any career in NASCAR history, Earnhardt's car owner Rod Osterlund would unexpectedly sell his race team midway through the 1981 season.
848500	854500	Earnhardt reacted poorly to this transition and struggled for the next few seasons while bouncing from owner to owner.
854500	861500	After going winless in 1981, Dale Earnhardt had the worst statistical season of his career the following season,
861500	869500	finishing the 1982 campaign with an abysmal average finish of 19th, while failing to finish more than half of his races for the year.
869500	875500	After such a promising beginning, Earnhardt's Winston Cup career had slammed straight into a concrete wall.
885500	894500	One of Earnhardt's 18 DNFs for the season resulted from a violent crash at Pocono that sent his number 15 Ford skidding on its roof down the embankment of the first corner.
894500	903500	The accident would fracture his kneecap, but it wouldn't stop the scrappy Earnhardt from racing the very next week at Talladega, where he would suffer another hard crash.
903500	907500	This was surely the most trying time of Earnhardt's racing career.
907500	912500	Many at this time began to wonder whether Earnhardt's 1980 championship was just a fluke.
912500	919500	But Dale Earnhardt was not like the other drivers. He wasn't racing for the fame or the fortune. He was racing to prove that he belonged.
919500	927500	He was racing to prove himself to his late father, and when a man is dead set on accomplishing an impossible task, he will never stop chasing it.
927500	935500	When faced with the lowest moment of his career, Dale Earnhardt did what he always did. He waited for an opportunity and pushed forward.
942500	947500	A brilliant maneuver by Earnhardt. The Chuckbert flag belongs today to Dale Earnhardt.
950500	953500	Stock Car Racing's all-time winner, Richard Petty.
953500	956500	When you need a mower, go with the best. Go with Lowe's.
956500	959500	You'll be a winner at Lowe's.
961500	965500	Every weekend throughout America, there is great NASCAR racing.
969500	971500	I wouldn't be anywhere else.
972500	974500	Congratulations.
1002500	1012500	Way too open against sexual law.
1012500	1015500	Is this the best a man can get?
1015500	1017500	This has to be sexual law.
1017500	1020500	Is this the best a man can get?
1020500	1021500	How dare you!
1021500	1023500	But something final will change.
1023500	1026500	Yes, you're an idiot. You're an idiot, okay?
1026500	1029500	I'm fucking better than you, okay? Much better than you.
1029500	1036500	You are garbage. I'm moving my mind tonight because of how stupid the majority of the country is.
1037500	1039500	Hey, we were watching that!
1039500	1047500	Join the club today and you'll see by 2019 won't be like 1984.
1050500	1058500	So that's the story of the 1984 Talladega 500. This fan, Dale Earnhardt, is successful.
1059500	1065500	In 1984, Dale Earnhardt found himself with a new owner, Richard Childress, and a new car number, 3.
1065500	1068500	He would stick with both of them for the rest of his career.
1068500	1074500	Under Childress, Earnhardt's career would immediately begin to rebound, and it would mark the beginning of his finest era.
1074500	1082500	By 1986, Earnhardt would be champion once more, becoming just the 11th driver in history to win multiple NASCAR championships.
1082500	1090500	In 1987, he had the best statistical season of his career, finishing the year with 11 wins and his third cup championship.
1090500	1097500	And after this dominant season, Earnhardt would return in black, embracing his new role as the Intimidator.
1097500	1103500	Now would probably be a good time to explain what exactly made Dale Earnhardt such a potent racer.
1103500	1110500	Well, Dale Earnhardt first learned his racing style from watching his father slide around on dirt tracks, and he never really unlearned it.
1110500	1116500	Remember earlier how I mentioned that the durability of stock cars allows them to more easily bump into each other?
1116500	1121500	Well, Dale Earnhardt would take this idea and turn his vehicle into a weapon.
1121500	1130500	Earnhardt would make frequent use of the bump and run, a racing tactic where a driver uses the inertia of their own car to move other drivers out of the way and advance their position.
1130500	1136500	It's a maneuver that's practically unheard of in open-wheel racing because it's really only possible in a series like NASCAR.
1137500	1141500	Even within NASCAR, the bump and run is still a highly controversial move.
1141500	1147500	Racing purists consider it a dirty tactic, as it detracts from the skill of outlining your competitors.
1147500	1154500	Other fans view it as a valid and necessary part of stock car racing, considering it's a viable strategy that's not against the rules.
1154500	1159500	Your outlook of this issue most likely determined whether or not you were a fan of Dale Earnhardt,
1159500	1164500	as his frequent use of the bump and run quickly made him one of the most polarizing drivers in NASCAR.
1164500	1169500	And his notoriety would only grow as he became one of the most dominant drivers in the sport.
1169500	1174500	For many drivers, nothing was scarier than seeing Dale Earnhardt in your rear-view mirror.
1174500	1180500	If you saw the number 3 Chevy behind you, you would either get out of his way, or he would make you get out of his way.
1180500	1183500	For many years, Earnhardt was NASCAR's greatest heel.
1183500	1186500	It's not fair, and they try to race nice and clean.
1186500	1190500	You know, the thing of it is, you go out and you run as hard as you can all day long.
1190500	1193500	And then him trying to cut you out, they outrun it. That ain't the way I was brought up racing.
1193500	1196500	I guess what they were insinuating, don't go running to Dale Earnhardt.
1196500	1200500	If you weren't an Earnhardt fan, it was probably very easy to hate him,
1200500	1204500	because there was a good chance you could recall a time when he wrecked your favorite driver.
1204500	1208500	Despite Earnhardt's tendency to enforce his will upon other drivers on the track,
1208500	1211500	he certainly had his fair share of supporters.
1211500	1216500	Dale Earnhardt raced in real life how anybody races the first time they pick up a NASCAR video game.
1216500	1220500	The other drivers were just obstacles separating him from first place.
1220500	1224500	Many fans found Earnhardt's cavalier style endearing and relatable.
1224500	1227500	He would struggle and claw for every single position,
1227500	1231500	much like how many fans in the poor American South had to struggle for every paycheck.
1231500	1235500	Who cares if he bangs up some other cars? He's just trying to win like the rest of them.
1235500	1240500	An uneducated small-town hick with no other prospects trying to turn lemons into lemonade.
1240500	1244500	For anyone stuck in rural America, Earnhardt represented the way out.
1244500	1247500	Standing outside of his car, Earnhardt was just like them.
1247500	1252500	But as soon as he stepped inside that black number three, he transformed into a racing god.
1252500	1257500	A lot of Earnhardt's detractors pointed to his racing style as an unfair crutch.
1257500	1262500	But eventually, for anyone watching long enough, his talent was undisputable.
1262500	1269500	And Earnhardt loses it, goes on the grass, comes back, and Earnhardt still got the lead! Incredible!
1269500	1273500	Although Dale Earnhardt remains one of the most memorable NASCAR drivers to this day,
1273500	1278500	he was never the most popular driver. That distinction belonged to Bill Elliott.
1278500	1283500	You know, the thing of it is, I have been not the aggressive driver all my life.
1283500	1286500	You know, I've tried to give and take with the best of the thing.
1286500	1291500	But when a guy cuts you off that bad and that obvious, it's time to take the other cheek.
1291500	1296500	Awesome Bill from Dawsonville, Georgia was in many ways a foil to Dale Earnhardt.
1296500	1301500	He, too, came from a racing family and rose to prominence in the 80s as one of NASCAR's best.
1301500	1306500	The soft-spoken and humble Elliott contrasted heavily with the outspoken and brash Earnhardt.
1306500	1312500	Whereas Earnhardt would gain notoriety for his combative racing style, the name of Elliott's game was speed.
1312500	1317500	Over the past decade in NASCAR, the overall speeds of the race cars had gradually risen,
1317500	1321500	especially on the giant super speedways of Daytona and Talladega.
1321500	1329500	In 1984, Cale Yarbrough became the first stock car driver in history to set a 200 mile per hour qualifying lap at Daytona.
1329500	1333500	The very next lap, he would lose control and total his race car.
1337500	1342500	As the speeds crept upwards, the drivers crept ever closer to the edge of control.
1342500	1346500	Despite the newfound risk, NASCAR's top speeds continued to climb.
1346500	1351500	With each new super speedway event, engineers and crews would roll out ever so faster cars.
1351500	1358500	And from 1985 to 1987, no car was faster than Bill Elliott's red and white Ford Thunderbird.
1358500	1366500	Perhaps his most stunning achievement came in the 1985 Winston 500 when Elliott cut an oil line and fell two laps behind the leaders,
1366500	1370500	only to make up the entire deficit under green and win the race.
1370500	1373500	His car was simply that much faster than the others.
1373500	1377500	In modern times, nobody has monopolized NASCAR racing like Bill Elliott.
1377500	1381500	He has raced around this season faster than a person throwing double sixes.
1381500	1390500	Two years later at the same event, Bill Elliott would set NASCAR's all-time speed record 212.8 miles per hour.
1393500	1401500	For comparison, the pole speed for the Indianapolis 500 that same year, the fastest open-wheel race, was 215.
1401500	1407500	It's also important to note that, on average, a stock car weighs about twice as much as an Indy car.
1408500	1411500	There's been a pretty big elephant in the room during this whole video.
1411500	1417500	So far I've talked on and on about the history of NASCAR, but I've yet to explain why people actually like it.
1417500	1421500	I mean, sure, it's easy to cherry-pick the sport's most exciting moments,
1421500	1426500	but what about the other 99% of the time is just regular old-fashioned racing?
1426500	1430500	What's the appeal of watching cars go around in circles?
1430500	1435500	Well, long story short, people don't watch NASCAR for the same reasons they watch other sports.
1435500	1438500	You can pick up a football and start playing right now in your backyard.
1438500	1441500	You can't just hop in a NASCAR and start racing people.
1441500	1448500	In order to understand the appeal of NASCAR, we have to talk about soldiers, astronauts, and prestige.
1448500	1451500	Being a soldier comes with a certain amount of prestige.
1451500	1457500	Most people find their sacrifice admirable, but you don't have to search far to find people who disagree.
1457500	1461500	You'd be hard-pressed, however, to find anyone who doubts the prestige of an astronaut.
1462500	1466500	You can talk about intelligence and science degrees and technical skill all you want,
1466500	1471500	but the fact of the matter is that soldiers fight against other soldiers in man-made wars,
1471500	1475500	while astronauts fight against the surly bonds of nature itself.
1475500	1479500	It takes bravery to volunteer yourself to go fight in some far-off foreign land,
1479500	1486500	but it takes a whole other level of bravery to strap yourself into a pressurized metal canister and fly out of the top of the sky.
1486500	1492500	Astronauts have so much prestige because they come the closest to kissing the snarling jaws of certain death.
1492500	1498500	There's no denying that war is also deadly, but humans have been fighting and killing each other since the dawn of man.
1498500	1500500	It's easy to understand the nature of warfare.
1500500	1503500	It's difficult to understand the limits of nature itself.
1503500	1508500	And nothing is more terrifying than what we don't understand.
1508500	1511500	Ah, who am I kidding? This is a dumb analogy.
1511500	1514500	NASCAR drivers are nothing like astronauts.
1514500	1517500	I mean, come on. Have you ever seen a NASCAR fly?
1526500	1531500	In the race immediately corresponding with Bill Elliott's record-breaking qualifying lap,
1531500	1534500	Bobby Allison would blow a tire in the tri-oval.
1534500	1539500	The back of his car would lift off the ground and sail into the catch fence at nearly 200 miles per hour.
1540500	1543500	It turns out that if you spin a car sideways at a fast enough speed,
1543500	1547500	the aerodynamics will force the car aloft like the wing of an airplane.
1547500	1557500	In the 1987 Winston 500, the 210 mile per hour pace was enough to lift up Bobby Allison's 3,500 pound race car like a piece of paper.
1557500	1561500	For a brief, surreal moment, all of NASCAR stood still.
1561500	1567500	By pure chance, Allison's left front fender clipped the wall the instant before the back of his car hit the catch fence,
1567500	1570500	which redirected the momentum of his car away from the spectators.
1570500	1573500	Had Allison spun at just a slightly different angle,
1573500	1578500	we could have witnessed a tragedy on the scale of the 1955 Le Mans disaster,
1578500	1582500	where an out-of-control race car was projected into the stands at a very high speed.
1582500	1585500	83 spectators were killed in the catastrophe,
1585500	1589500	leading many European nations to place a temporary ban on all motorsports.
1589500	1593500	To this day, it remains the deadliest accident in racing history.
1593500	1597500	Allison's car had sheared a 100 foot gap in the protective fencing,
1597500	1601500	and NASCAR fans found themselves staring into an eerie window of what could have happened.
1601500	1606500	Miraculously, only five spectators were injured, and no one was killed.
1606500	1611500	The line between driver and spectator had been severed, and it could have ended NASCAR entirely.
1611500	1617500	Fortunately, NASCAR would make good use of their second chance, as the era of speed came to a permanent end.
1624500	1630500	This accident would force NASCAR to implement restrictor plates at all future super speedway races,
1630500	1634500	which would limit the horsepower of all cars to keep them below dangerous speeds.
1634500	1638500	This would profoundly change the way drivers raced at Daytona and Talladega.
1638500	1642500	Gone were the days of Bill Elliott making up five miles under green.
1642500	1646500	Restrictor plates made it so that cars could no longer pull away from each other,
1646500	1649500	instead emphasizing the attractive effects of slipstream.
1650500	1653500	Simple racing moves such as passing were now drastically altered,
1653500	1657500	as timing and aerodynamics were now much more important than speed and handling.
1665500	1668500	Naturally, many drivers were unhappy with this new change,
1668500	1672500	and no driver hated restrictor plate racing more than Dale Earnhardt.
1672500	1677500	Which was a little odd, considering he was the best restrictor plate racer on the planet.
1702500	1720500	It was one of the most dominant runs of any race category in motorsports history,
1720500	1725500	and it happened during a time when NASCAR had arguably its toughest ever competition.
1725500	1729500	The 90s truly were a golden age of NASCAR in popular culture.
1729500	1735500	Attendance and television ratings steadily rose as movies like Days of Thunder drew intrigue from across the nation.
1735500	1740500	Big brands and TV networks were lining up to capture their own slice of the booming NASCAR scene.
1740500	1742500	NASCAR had gone fully national,
1742500	1747500	and it had fundamentally transformed itself from a simple showcase of speed in the prior decade.
1747500	1752500	The sponsors, drivers, tracks, and cars had all changed, but one thing remained the same.
1752500	1755500	Dale Earnhardt was dominating the competition.
1755500	1762500	From 1990 to 1994, Dale Earnhardt would win four more cup championships, tying Richard Petty's record of seven,
1762500	1766500	a record considered by many to be untouchable just ten years prior.
1766500	1771500	With each new championship, it became harder and harder for people to disregard Earnhardt's success.
1771500	1778500	Although many still resented his racing style, you can't win seven NASCAR championships without being a pretty talented driver.
1778500	1783500	Earnhardt's detractors were simply running out of excuses to deny his greatness.
1783500	1788500	Soon, there was only one thing keeping Dale out of the conversation for the greatest of all time.
1788500	1790500	Now, you've not won Daytona, right?
1790500	1796500	I've won Daytona, the firecracker race in July, but I haven't won the Daytona 500. That's like the Super Bowl race for us.
1799500	1808500	After 17 years of effort, the Daytona 500 belongs to Franklin, Tennessee's Darryl Waltrip. He's done it.
1808500	1812500	Oh, I won the Daytona 500! I won the Daytona 500!
1812500	1818500	In 1989, Darryl Waltrip won his first and only Daytona 500 in his 17th attempt.
1818500	1826500	At the time, he was considered the best driver to never win it, and after he did, everyone was left to wonder about the next best driver to take Waltrip's place.
1826500	1832500	Immediately, many thought of Dale Earnhardt, who had yet to win the Daytona 500 after 11 tries.
1832500	1841500	But surely in 1990, while entering the final corner of the final lap in first place, after leading three quarters of the race, Earnhardt could put the narrative to rest.
1841500	1848500	They still run single file. Halfway down the back, straightaway, half a lap to go. Still, Earnhardt now stretching his lead by another car length over Cope.
1848500	1854500	Labonte can't do anything with Cope either. Earnhardt's car blows up! Earnhardt blows a tire in turn number 3!
1854500	1866500	And on the outside, it is car number 10, Derek Cope. Something to miss on the Earnhardt car. Coming to the line, it's Labonte pulling up at an amazing finish!
1871500	1873500	Dale, what the heck happened on the last lap?
1873500	1880500	We ran over some debris and cut a right rear tire down, David. Just a quarter of a lap away from victory.
1884500	1893500	In 1991, Earnhardt would damage his car after hitting a seagull, forcing him to pit. He would battle all the way back to second place before crashing with two laps to go.
1893500	1898500	Dale Earnhardt fails to win the Daytona 500 again.
1898500	1902500	In 1992, Earnhardt would get caught up in a crash that wasn't his fault.
1902500	1908500	A newfound consequence of restrictor plate racing were massive crashes that would often wipe out over a dozen cars.
1908500	1916500	After a while, these crashes seemed almost inevitable due to the extremely close pack racing that now resembled rush hour traffic, but at 190 miles per hour.
1916500	1921500	One slight error by a single driver could spark a chain reaction that would take many cars out of the race.
1921500	1928500	It was one of Earnhardt's main reasons for hating restrictor plate racing, and he would fall victim to it numerous times.
1928500	1936500	In 1993, Earnhardt would once again lead most of the race, only to finish second after Dale Jarrett passed him on the final lap.
1936500	1944500	After a seventh place finish in 1994, Earnhardt would finish second again in 1995, and again in 1996.
1944500	1952500	Later in the 1996 season, Earnhardt would suffer a horrific looking crash that sent his number three Chevy tumbling down the Talladega front stretch.
1956500	1965500	Dale Earnhardt attempting to walk to the ambulance as he walks away from one of the worst incidents in his racing career.
1965500	1971500	While it was known that Dale Earnhardt hated restrictor plate racing, it was starting to look like restrictor plate racing hated him.
1971500	1978500	All those questions for Earnhardt, so close, so many times, when it should have been his, and it wasn't.
1978500	1983500	If we get the right help, we're at the right place at the right time, it's like I just told Richard, I said, what do you think?
1983500	1990500	You know him better than I do. He said, I've been here a lot of times before, and you can bet he's been in the floor pan right now with that throttle pedal,
1990500	1994500	but if it's racing God's time to shine on that three, we'll just have to see.
1994500	2001500	As was the formula at this point, Earnhardt ran up front all day and found himself in a battle for the lead with just a few laps to go.
2001500	2004500	And all of a sudden, he found himself on his roof once again.
2007500	2012500	Down the back straightaway, big trouble, Earnhardt out.
2014500	2023500	Up and over, number three, and for the 19th time, Lady Luck yields a bad hand.
2023500	2029500	I'm not sure I actually believe in curses, but Dale Earnhardt's misfortune in the Daytona 500 really made me consider it.
2029500	2039500	For some wicked reason, the seven-time NASCAR champion and best super speedway racer in the world could not, for the life of him, win this one super speedway race.
2039500	2046500	Earnhardt's gut-wrenching futility at this one event is made even more insane when you consider that he's the winningest driver in the history of the track.
2046500	2055500	No, seriously. By 1997, Earnhardt had won pretty much every stock car event at Daytona multiple times over, all except the one that mattered most.
2055500	2059500	After 19 tries and 19 failures, he should have been completely discouraged.
2059500	2064500	But Dale Earnhardt was not a quitting man. He wasn't even willing to quit this race.
2064500	2069500	What a pile of grit. Earnhardt is in the car, he's barking instructions to the crew.
2069500	2074500	This thing is so beat up, if Earnhardt can make one lap or two, it's an absolute miracle.
2074500	2082500	Even though he no longer had any chance of winning, Dale Earnhardt would hop out of the ambulance and back into his mangled car to finish the race.
2082500	2089500	When faced with the lowest moment of his career, Dale Earnhardt did what he always did. He waited for an opportunity and pushed forward.
2089500	2097500	But Earnhardt has a benefit. There's a slow car up ahead.
2097500	2104500	And there's trouble coming off a turn two. Some cars get strangled and it might be this. Whoever gets back to the start finish line, they'll get the white and the yellow together.
2104500	2113500	20 years of trying. 20 years of frustration. Dale Earnhardt will come to the caution flag to win the Daytona 500.
2114500	2128500	Finally, every man on every crew has come out to the edge of pit lane to congratulate the man who has dominated everything there is to win in this sport.
2128500	2137500	Except this race until today. They used to boo Dale Earnhardt when he was winning too much. That'll happen if you dominate any sport.
2137500	2143500	But today, when they introduced the Intimidator, the crowd was full of cheers.
2143500	2150500	All them race fans and all them people have been saying, Dale, this is your year. Dale, this is your year. And boy, a lot of them said it this year.
2150500	2154500	The Daytona 500 is ours. We've won it. We've won it. We've won it.
2154500	2166500	The hangover from Earnhardt's Daytona 500 victory lasted throughout the 1998 season, where Dale would not win another race and finish a distant eighth in points.
2166500	2171500	Perhaps overcoming the single greatest foe in his racing career was a little demotivating.
2171500	2175500	After winning the 500, Earnhardt had almost nothing left to accomplish.
2175500	2179500	He could have tried for another championship, breaking the tie with Richard Petty.
2179500	2183500	But both he and a lot of others began to tell that his age was starting to get the best of him.
2183500	2188500	Later in the 1998 season, Earnhardt suffered his second hard crash at Talladega in two years.
2188500	2194500	In the post-race interview, Earnhardt for the first time ever sounded fed up, exhausted, and demoralized.
2194500	2197500	What was the day like up to that point?
2197500	2202500	It was good. It's not good racing, though. Y'all can talk about all you want. It ain't good racing.
2202500	2204500	Y'all can talk about all you want. It ain't good racing.
2204500	2209500	In 1999, Earnhardt would infamously dump Terry Levanti to win at Bristol.
2219500	2224500	Any goodwill he had from his crowning achievement just a year prior had worn out its welcome,
2224500	2229500	as Earnhardt was showered in a chorus of boos from the 140,000 in attendance.
2233500	2237500	At this point, Earnhardt and the fans had a mutual yearning for something new.
2254500	2259500	While Dale Earnhardt never achieved his dream of racing alongside his father, he was able to race alongside his son.
2259500	2265500	Dale Earnhardt Jr. made his full-time Winston Cup debut in 2000 under his father's own race team.
2265500	2272500	Dale Jr. captured his first career win in just his 12th overall start, almost 21 years to the day of his father's first win.
2272500	2278500	In victory lane that day, Dale Sr. appeared to take more pride in his son's accomplishment than any of his own.
2278500	2281500	Racing with his son seemed to renew Dale Earnhardt's sense of purpose.
2281500	2286500	Some would say that's all he ever really wanted, to race side by side with his own flesh and blood.
2286500	2293500	And although the aging Earnhardt was nearing the end of his career, he would still make you think twice about questioning his greatness.
2311500	2313500	Earnhardt trying to come up through the middle.
2314500	2318500	Through a minefield of race cars at 190 miles an hour.
2318500	2320500	And here comes Earnhardt.
2320500	2323500	How did he get through all these cars?
2323500	2326500	He doesn't understand how he did that.
2326500	2329500	The intimidator is scraped and beaten to the right side.
2329500	2332500	But he will not be denied.
2332500	2335500	And Earnhardt is going for the lead.
2335500	2338500	And listen to this crowd of the hurting 70,000 strong.
2343500	2345500	Let's go!
2348500	2355500	Dale Earnhardt comes down and will take his 10th career victory at Talladega.
2355500	2362500	Legend has it that Dale Earnhardt was so good at restrictor plate racing because he could see the air coming off of the other cars.
2362500	2365500	And used this ability to perfectly time his passes.
2365500	2371500	Dale Earnhardt's 76th and final career win came, fittingly, in a restrictor plate race at Talladega.
2371500	2373500	Take a look at this moment.
2373500	2378500	That is Michael Waltrip out of control, tri-oval, into a series of sidewinders.
2378500	2381500	Nine shattering snap rolls.
2381500	2387500	Prior to the start of the 2001 season, DEI signed Michael Waltrip to drive the number 15 Chevy.
2387500	2392500	Michael Waltrip had spent his entire career racing in the shadow of his older brother, Darrell.
2392500	2397500	And after 15 lackluster seasons, Michael Waltrip was still seeking his first career win.
2397500	2404500	Dale Earnhardt believed in Michael, however, and he would open 2001 racing not just with his son, but with his team.
2404500	2406500	I think all of you know what happens next.
2406500	2409500	It was probably the only thing you knew about Dale Earnhardt.
2409500	2415500	On one February afternoon, Dale Earnhardt would enter his black number three for the final time.
2427500	2430500	Dale Earnhardt won the World Series.
2430500	2433500	Dale Earnhardt won the World Series.
2433500	2436500	Dale Earnhardt won the World Series.
2436500	2439500	Dale Earnhardt won the World Series.
2439500	2442500	Dale Earnhardt won the World Series.
2442500	2445500	Dale Earnhardt won the World Series.
2445500	2448500	Dale Earnhardt won the World Series.
2448500	2452500	Dale Earnhardt won the World Series.
2452500	2455500	Dale Earnhardt won the World Series.
2455500	2458500	Dale Earnhardt won the World Series.
2458500	2461500	Dale Earnhardt won the World Series.
2461500	2464500	Dale Earnhardt won the World Series.
2464500	2467500	Dale Earnhardt won the World Series.
2467500	2470500	Dale Earnhardt won the World Series.
2470500	2473500	Dale Earnhardt won the World Series.
2473500	2476500	Dale Earnhardt won the World Series.
2476500	2479500	Dale Earnhardt won the World Series.
2480500	2481500	Welcome back to Dave's Corner.
2481500	2482500	It's the big one, gang. It's the big one.
2482500	2485500	It's what we've all been fearing. This kind of racing is going to happen.
2485500	2493500	A horrible crash on the back straightaway that began when Tony Stewart got turned sideways against the backstretched wall number 20.
2493500	2499500	Boy, when it gets hit by every car in the field, it seems like in Tony Stewart's car just took a whale up a rack.
2499500	2502500	God help all of them because there's no place to go.
2502500	2508500	Incidentally, the crash would leave Dale Earnhardt in third position behind the DEI cars of Dale Jr. and Michael Waltrip.
2509500	2514500	As the laps wound down, everyone began to realize that Dale Earnhardt wasn't trying to win the race.
2514500	2519500	Rather, he was holding back the rest of the field so that his team could win instead.
2519500	2523500	Dale managed to hold off everybody until the final corner of the final lap.
2523500	2527500	Three wide behind them. You got him, Mikey. You got him, man. You got him.
2527500	2530500	The three car down. Big trouble.
2530500	2532500	The cameras cut away from the accident.
2532500	2540500	It should have been one of the happiest moments in NASCAR history, as Darrell Waltrip joyfully commentated his brother's first win on the grandest stage of all.
2540500	2544500	A storybook ending to a picturesque day of thrilling, action-packed racing.
2544500	2549500	And then the cameras cut to Dale Earnhardt's crumpled vehicle lying at rest in the infield grass.
2549500	2554500	Nobody knew it at the time, but the greatest tragedy in NASCAR history had just occurred.
2554500	2559500	Dale Earnhardt, NASCAR's greatest driver, was dead at 49.
2560500	2564500	This is undoubtedly one of the toughest announcements that I've ever personally had to make.
2565500	2572500	But after the accident in turn 4 at the end of the Daytona 500, we've lost Dale Earnhardt.
2577500	2583500	The official cause of death is listed as a basilar skull fracture sustained as a result of blunt force trauma.
2583500	2587500	When Dale Earnhardt struck the turn 4 wall, he died instantly.
2587500	2591500	Looking back on it all today, it's hard to believe it even happened.
2591500	2595500	Dale Earnhardt was NASCAR's Iron Man, the toughest driver in the sport.
2595500	2597500	He hadn't missed a race since his rookie season.
2597500	2600500	He walked away from this and this.
2600500	2602500	Why did he die from this?
2602500	2606500	How did no one die from this crash earlier in the race?
2606500	2612500	Well, at over 190 miles per hour, destinies can be profoundly altered by a matter of inches.
2612500	2618500	NASCAR's greatest tragedy was avoided by inches, and NASCAR's greatest tragedy was caused by inches.
2618500	2623500	In the lap 173 crash, Dale Earnhardt was just inches away from getting collected.
2623500	2629500	Ironically, if Earnhardt had just been a little less fortunate here, it's likely that he would still be alive today.
2629500	2635500	I remember him coming on there, and I can't remember if it was before or as soon as a wreck happened or during the red flag,
2635500	2640500	but he said, Richard, if they don't do something to these cars, it's going to end up killing somebody.
2643500	2646500	Dale Earnhardt was always aware of NASCAR's darkest secret.
2646500	2649500	He just never imagined that he'd be the one reminding everyone of the truth.
2649500	2653500	NASCAR is caked with the blood of dead drivers.
2653500	2657500	The reason NASCAR was so compelling was because it was deadly.
2657500	2660500	Obviously, no one actively wished death upon drivers,
2660500	2667500	but it was mutually understood as an inherent risk of gliding around in a 3,500-pound hunk of metal at 190 miles per hour.
2667500	2671500	Every few years or so, a driver would unexpectedly die in a race.
2671500	2676500	Since the very beginning of the sport, this was the dark reality in the back of everyone's mind.
2676500	2682500	You never wanted to see it happen, but when it did, you accepted it as inevitable and moved on.
2682500	2684500	Dale's death was very different, though.
2684500	2686500	Many racing fans still haven't moved on.
2686500	2692500	It was just too painful, the biggest icon in racing dying in the middle of the biggest event.
2692500	2698500	Imagine if Michael Jordan died during the NBA Finals or if Tom Brady died during the Super Bowl.
2698500	2702500	This is what it felt like watching Dale Earnhardt die in the Daytona 500,
2702500	2707500	and in my humble opinion, it's the single worst tragedy in the history of American sports.
2708500	2712500	Even though Dale Earnhardt's death was a devastating shock for the millions of fans watching,
2712500	2717500	you could at least take solace in knowing that he probably wouldn't have wanted to go out any other way.
2717500	2719500	Dale Earnhardt died doing what he loved,
2719500	2725500	and his final memory was watching his own drivers speeding towards the finish line with nothing but open racetrack in front of them.
2729500	2733500	I think Dale Earnhardt was the best race driver that's ever been in a stock car. How do you feel about that?
2733500	2735500	Oh, yeah, that's a big statement.
2735500	2738500	You know, I think my dad was the greatest when it comes to racers.
2738500	2744500	For as much as he accomplished, no one knew for sure if Dale ever felt he proved himself to his father.
2744500	2751500	It's a burden he took to his grave, leaving us to wonder about Dale much in the same way Dale had to wonder about Ralph.
2751500	2755500	The only thing we know for sure is that Dale finally caught up with his father's ghost.
2756500	2758500	The story doesn't end here.
2758500	2764500	Although NASCAR suffered perhaps its greatest ever loss, they still had 35 more races to run that season,
2764500	2769500	when faced with their lowest moment, NASCAR had no other option but to push forward.
2774500	2784500	Park has the run off the high side, he clears the body, and Steve Park scores the second straight win for Earnhardt Incorporated and the second win of his career.
2784500	2788500	And that team, that company, Dale Earnhardt Incorporated, they need it all.
2788500	2794500	With an Earnhardt hat in his hand, Steve Park will drive to Victory Lane.
2803500	2808500	Just like a year ago, he's going to get him though, he's going to get him. Gordon Gondola, Jim Torben.
2808500	2810500	Torben by inches.
2810500	2812500	Torben by inches.
2812500	2816500	The replay of a year ago with Dale Earnhardt and Bobby LaVon.
2816500	2822500	Look at Kevin Harvick as the fans saluted Dale with the number 3 on the third lap.
2822500	2825500	Kevin Harvick salutes him on the way to Victory Lane.
2825500	2828500	If I was him, I'd run that thing out of gas riding around here.
2828500	2833500	What could be more fitting? What could be more special?
2833500	2845500	To the outside for the lead in Turn 4, Dale Earnhardt Jr. rockets to the front of Daytona. Listen to the crowd.
2845500	2848500	And look at this crowd behind him.
2848500	2853500	Here they come, Turn 4, final lap of the Pepsi 400.
2853500	2857500	Michael Waltrip in second, but it's going to be Dale Earnhardt Jr.
2857500	2864500	Dale Earnhardt Jr. using lessons learned from his father to go from sixth to first and score the victory of the Pepsi 400.
2864500	2866500	That's unbelievable.
2866500	2867500	Yes!
2867500	2868500	Bam, he did it.
2868500	2869500	Yes!
2869500	2870500	Love you, man.
2870500	2871500	You did it.
2871500	2874500	That was beautiful. Very, very nice.
2874500	2875500	Junior, you're happy.
2875500	2876500	Alright.
2876500	2879500	Look at that smile.
2879500	2880500	Wow.
2880500	2888500	And with the most cathartic moment in NASCAR history, Dale Earnhardt Jr. would win at the track that took his father's life just five months earlier.
2888500	2893500	For many fans, this win was enough to heal the wounds from the tragedy of that year's Daytona 500.
2893500	2898500	Some fans thought this finish was literally too good to be true and that NASCAR rigged it.
2898500	2903500	A compelling theory until you consider the years of DEI restrictor plate dominance that followed.
2903500	2912500	From 2001 through 2003, DEI carried the torch of Dale Earnhardt's restrictor plate prowess by winning nine of the twelve Super Speedway events.
2912500	2920500	In 2004, Dale Jr. would achieve what took his father twenty years by winning the Daytona 500 in just his fifth attempt.
2920500	2928500	The legacy continues. Dale Earnhardt Jr. wins the 46th Daytona 500.
2928500	2934500	Following the death of Dale Earnhardt, NASCAR would work to implement an unprecedented amount of driver safety improvements,
2934500	2942500	most notably the HANS device, safer barrier, and Car of Tomorrow to make sure that an accident like Dale Earnhardt's could never happen again.
2942500	2963500	Incredibly hard impact. Look at that safer barrier right there, how it just crushed all that stuff.
2963500	2968500	Oh, thank goodness. And a wave to the fans. My goodness.
2968500	2976500	And to this day, Dale Earnhardt still remains NASCAR's last fatality.
2976500	2982500	Unfortunately, NASCAR's great strides in driver safety may be the only positive news for the sport in the past decade.
2982500	2987500	Attendance, sponsorships, and television ratings have all drastically declined in the past ten years,
2987500	2991500	leaving the few remaining fans to wonder what exactly drove everyone away.
2991500	2996500	Some people blame the recent mismanagement from Brian France and other NASCAR executives.
2996500	3001500	Some people blame the chase and other gimmicks that have alienated NASCAR's core fanbase.
3001500	3004500	Some people blame the lack of interesting or relatable drivers.
3004500	3010500	Some people blame the recession and how it hit NASCAR's core audience the hardest, preventing them from going to races.
3010500	3017500	If you ask me, however, the main reason so many fans stopped watching NASCAR is, ironically, because it got safer.
3017500	3025500	As morbid as it is to say, by removing the inherent risk of racing, NASCAR removed the one thing that separated them from all other sports.
3025500	3030500	Today, NASCAR drivers have never been farther from the snarling jaws of certain death.
3030500	3033500	And the sport has been made far less compelling as a result.
3033500	3039500	Not sure where Carl's going. Maybe he thinks a team runs across the start-finish line. That doesn't count.
3039500	3042500	That's what he's got. That's what he's doing. That's what he's doing.
3042500	3046500	You know how he is. He's an athlete, a marathon runner. I want to finish the race.
3046500	3052500	And he did. To a standing ovation from the crowd. Shades of Ricky Bobby.
3052500	3057500	Ever since that fateful day, NASCAR fans have been trying to fill the void that Dale Earnhardt left.
3057500	3060500	There's the driver who carried on his name, Dale Earnhardt Jr.
3060500	3066500	Following his father's passing, he became NASCAR's perennial most popular driver until his retirement in 2017.
3066500	3076500	Although he finished with a respectable 26 career wins, Dale Jr. failed to capture a single championship and could never live up to his father's godlike legacy.
3076500	3083500	There's the driver who carried on his car, Kevin Harvick, who was able to capture at least one championship and his own Daytona 500 victory.
3083500	3087500	A successful career for sure, but not much compared to Earnhardt's.
3087500	3095500	There's the driver who carried on his title as the seven-time champion, Jimmy Johnson, who in 2016 became the third ever driver to accomplish this feat.
3095500	3101500	While he is statistically the best driver since Earnhardt, Johnson never managed to appeal to the fans in the same way.
3101500	3106500	As his relatively bland demeanor failed to capture the hearts and minds of the greater audience.
3106500	3109500	And then there's the driver who carried on Earnhardt's number.
3109500	3114500	After the tragedy, Richard Childress retired the number from active competition for over a decade.
3114500	3119500	But he brought it back in 2014 for the full-time cup debut of his grandson, Austin Dillon.
3119500	3128500	In 2015, at the finish of the July Daytona race, Dillon would suffer a gruesome looking accident where his car was launched directly into the catch fence.
3128500	3135500	For a brief moment, every fan watching tensed up in horror after witnessing what they thought was the second fatality in the three-car at Daytona.
3135500	3139500	Incredibly, Austin Dillon walked away from this with only minor injuries.
3139500	3145500	Some have called him the luckiest driver in NASCAR today, but his luck hasn't contributed to much success on the track.
3145500	3150500	So far, after five full-time seasons, Dillon has only two wins to his name.
3150500	3154500	One of those wins came in the 2018 Daytona 500.
3154500	3160500	As 20 years after Earnhardt's storybook victory, the three-car returned to Victory Lane at Daytona.
3160500	3164500	And here it comes with the number three, 20 years ago.
3164500	3168500	20 years of trying for Earnhardt. He won the Daytona 500.
3168500	3174500	Austin Dillon wins the 60th running of the Great American Race.
3174500	3179500	We're all searching for the next Dale Earnhardt, but we know deep down that he's irreplaceable.
3179500	3185500	Many fans consider Earnhardt the greatest NASCAR driver of all time, possibly because we never got to see him decline.
3185500	3193500	Dale Earnhardt remained one of the best drivers in the sport till the day he died, and even then, he still finished ahead of 30 other drivers.
3197500	3204500	Everyone knows what it's like to be stuck in bumper-to-bumper traffic, and all of us experience the same desire to break free from all the gridlock.
3204500	3210500	Not just from the traffic, but from everything. Responsibilities, labor, authority.
3210500	3214500	Sometimes there's no better feeling than seeing miles of open road in front of you.
3214500	3220500	Dale Earnhardt gave this feeling to millions watching at home, and seeing Dale succeed made them believe they could too.
3220500	3225500	For many, Dale Earnhardt was a real-life hero, but most people will never know his story.
3225500	3228500	Most people only know him as some guy who died.
3228500	3234500	They'll never know about the turmoil, the struggle, the determination, the notoriety, the heartbreak, or the triumph.
3234500	3239500	They'll never care about any of it, because who could care about a bunch of cars going around in circles?
3239500	3245500	NASCAR may never be popular again. Realistically, it probably should have never become popular in the first place.
3245500	3250500	It's just a simple sport where no-name hillbillies gather to watch a bunch of fast cars race each other.
3250500	3252500	But Dale Earnhardt made it mean more than that.
3252500	3259500	And for as long as NASCAR sticks around, stock car racing fans will always remember the man in the black number three.
3259500	3262500	Because there will never ever be another driver like him.
3262500	3268500	You got plenty of money. Don't need that to keep racing. Is it worth the risk to keep on going?
3268500	3270500	Sure, to win.
3280500	3295500	.
