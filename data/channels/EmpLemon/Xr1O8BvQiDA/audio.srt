00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,200
Hi everyone, it's me, Emperor Lemon, and I just really wanted to share my thoughts on this issue.

2
00:00:06,200 --> 00:00:11,360
So I'm here to make this video because Behind the Meme did a really bad thing.

3
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:16,960
Behind the Meme may have just made the worst mistake of his YouTube career.

4
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:27,160
So for those of you who don't know the whole story, Behind the Meme basically spent a week and a half uploading these cryptic, disturbing series of videos

5
00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:33,480
depicting himself falling into a deep, emotionally disturbed depression.

6
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:39,560
Nobody was really willing to say that these videos weren't real, so everyone got legitimately concerned.

7
00:00:39,560 --> 00:00:47,080
And for the first time in a long time, he had a large group of people unabashedly supporting him.

8
00:00:47,080 --> 00:00:49,560
And then he uploaded the final video of the series.

9
00:00:49,560 --> 00:00:55,080
And in this video, he, for lack of a better term, stages a fake suicide.

10
00:00:55,080 --> 00:01:02,200
He takes a gun, puts it up to his head, and then puts in a really obvious gunshot sound effect and blood effect.

11
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:07,720
And he kills himself in a way that's just completely, insultingly, obviously fake.

12
00:01:07,720 --> 00:01:15,000
And right after that, at the end of the video, he reveals that the whole thing was just his way of raising suicide awareness.

13
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:20,360
And immediately, once people realized they had been duped, they began turning against him.

14
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:27,000
There were many people in the community that threw their unconditional support behind Behind the Meme,

15
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:32,040
and they ended up looking like fools for falling for this fake scheme.

16
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:36,520
And from a totally impartial perspective, this looks really bad.

17
00:01:36,520 --> 00:01:43,320
It would appear that Behind the Meme took advantage of the serious issues of suicide and depression,

18
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:48,600
emotionally manipulated his audience, consisting mostly of young children,

19
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:52,600
into thinking that he was actually endangering himself.

20
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:56,760
And it would seem that he did all of this for attention.

21
00:01:56,760 --> 00:02:03,880
And it is certainly the most hateable thing he has ever done in his YouTube career.

22
00:02:03,880 --> 00:02:07,960
Getting hated for making mediocre videos about memes is one thing,

23
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:13,880
but taking advantage of suicide and depression and emotionally manipulating your audience

24
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:18,200
is something that, for a lot of people, is unforgivable.

25
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:22,360
And this whole time this video was coming out, I never really bought into it.

26
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:26,920
I was one of the few people who, throughout the whole ordeal, thought it was fake.

27
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:31,080
And I was almost certain that this would be the exact outcome,

28
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:34,360
and Behind the Meme would reveal himself as a fraud.

29
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:39,960
Because people who thought this was serious were all gearing up, lining up to jump down my throat,

30
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:43,560
and tar and feather me if anything bad happened to Behind the Meme.

31
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:46,360
Because as far as most of the community knows,

32
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:49,640
I'm apparently the guy who ruined Behind the Meme's life.

33
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:53,880
But I knew that wasn't gonna happen because I knew these videos were fake from the beginning.

34
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:56,280
So I come out with my statement on Twitter saying this,

35
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:01,640
and literally a few hours later I get instantly proven correct.

36
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:03,720
And that was it.

37
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:06,760
Behind the Meme revealed that the videos were fake the whole time.

38
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:08,520
And I was right.

39
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:10,040
And people were turning on him.

40
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:11,560
And he was getting hated.

41
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:16,760
And with this outcome in mind, I was so prepared to get up there on my high horse

42
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:19,080
and dance around on his channel's grave saying,

43
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:20,040
I told you so.

44
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:24,120
I was so ready to take all the hate I got from that Behind the Meme video

45
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:25,720
and say, well, look at this.

46
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:27,640
Look who was right the whole time.

47
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:33,240
But then right as Behind the Meme's reputation was just burning down right in front of my eyes,

48
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:34,760
I didn't feel any gratification.

49
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:38,520
Everything had gone exactly how I thought it would.

50
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:41,960
And yet, I didn't feel like I won anything.

51
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:47,800
And I can't believe I'm saying this, but I actually feel bad for Behind the Meme now.

52
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:53,240
For the whole time, from when I first started working on the Behind the Meme video,

53
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:59,480
all the way up until the fake suicide video, I didn't have one bit of sympathy for the guy.

54
00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:06,440
Even as he was being vociferously hated by a group of people that I directly inspired,

55
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:08,120
I didn't feel sorry for the guy.

56
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:14,120
But for some reason now, during an event in which it would seem the most justified

57
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:17,640
to hate Behind the Meme, I actually feel sorry for him.

58
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:21,560
And the reason for that is the video he uploaded,

59
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:29,240
where he fictitiously shoots himself in the head, was so unbelievably poorly executed

60
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:34,760
that I realized that Behind the Meme may have honestly thought in his head

61
00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:39,320
that this was a good idea and that he was supporting a noble cause.

62
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:42,200
For this whole time I was against Behind the Meme,

63
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:47,640
it was predicated under the assumption that he had some sort of ulterior motive.

64
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:53,560
Like he was making videos for money or attention or simply to take advantage of people

65
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:55,080
or because he was lazy.

66
00:04:55,080 --> 00:05:00,920
But never once did I consider that this guy might just be some fool with a genuinely good heart

67
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:06,280
who somehow stumbled his way into this position of influence by just sheer dumb luck.

68
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:10,760
And the more I thought about it, the more I realized that Behind the Meme

69
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:16,440
this whole time might have just been some naive guy with nothing but good intentions.

70
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:22,920
I've just become so used to the idea that YouTubers are disingenuous people,

71
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:27,880
that they all carry around this fake persona where they do nothing but pander to fans

72
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:31,640
and market themselves and help their personal brand

73
00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:36,920
and wheel and deal behind the scenes to make sure that their channel makes as much money as possible.

74
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:41,480
And I never considered the possibility that perhaps Behind the Meme isn't any of those things

75
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:46,280
and what he does and says in his videos is just honestly how he is in real life.

76
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:50,200
And the more I think about it, the more I believe that it's actually true.

77
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:54,360
I mean, Behind the Meme doesn't act like other YouTubers.

78
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:55,640
And with that being said,

79
00:05:55,640 --> 00:06:00,520
the first thing that comes to mind is that he has done no networking whatsoever.

80
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:04,520
He has never ever spoken to anyone from the meme community

81
00:06:04,520 --> 00:06:06,920
or even the YouTube community for that matter.

82
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:11,240
He never buttered himself up to any bigger YouTuber when he was trying to get popular.

83
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:15,800
He literally did everything by himself without any other YouTuber's help or approval.

84
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:17,880
And when I think of his videos,

85
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:22,280
even though they tend to carry the appearance of gimmicky clickbait,

86
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:26,840
he just doesn't seem to employ the same tactics that other sleazy YouTubers use

87
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:30,920
when they're trying to game the system and only care about views and money.

88
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:32,920
Sure, his videos may seem padded out,

89
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:36,840
but he never seemed to stretch all of them out to 10 minutes to get more ad breaks.

90
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:41,000
He didn't upload every day trying to soak in as many views as possible.

91
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,240
He never really shilled out merchandise.

92
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:46,200
He never did scammy gift card giveaways.

93
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:48,840
He didn't do any of that stuff that most YouTubers do

94
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:51,240
when they only care about money and attention.

95
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:54,360
It seems like from all the actions of his YouTube career,

96
00:06:54,360 --> 00:07:00,440
Behind the Meme may have just been a guy who simply took satisfaction from making people happy.

97
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:05,560
And I know his latest series of videos look really bad for him.

98
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:09,320
But the more I look into it, the more I believe it's true

99
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:15,400
that Behind the Meme is just a clueless guy with no self-awareness

100
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:18,760
who was genuinely trying to spread a positive message.

101
00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:20,760
And I don't really know how to feel about that.

102
00:07:20,760 --> 00:07:22,840
He's probably gonna get hammered for this.

103
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:25,480
People are legitimately gonna hate him for this video.

104
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:26,840
I guess I just want to say this.

105
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:31,080
A lot of you out there may really want to hate Behind the Meme for this incident.

106
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:32,600
And I'm here to say don't.

107
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:34,440
Don't hate the guy.

108
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:35,480
Take it from me.

109
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:39,160
A guy who many people view as Behind the Meme's worst enemy.

110
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:44,120
His videos might be mediocre and dumb and really poorly thought out,

111
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:47,000
but it's just not worth hating the guy.

112
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:50,680
I said this at the beginning of the Behind the Meme video and I'll say it now.

113
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:52,120
Enough is enough.

114
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:56,360
It's time to finally put this issue to rest and leave Behind the Meme alone.
