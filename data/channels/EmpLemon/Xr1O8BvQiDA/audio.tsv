0	6200	Hi everyone, it's me, Emperor Lemon, and I just really wanted to share my thoughts on this issue.
6200	11360	So I'm here to make this video because Behind the Meme did a really bad thing.
11360	16960	Behind the Meme may have just made the worst mistake of his YouTube career.
16960	27160	So for those of you who don't know the whole story, Behind the Meme basically spent a week and a half uploading these cryptic, disturbing series of videos
27160	33480	depicting himself falling into a deep, emotionally disturbed depression.
33480	39560	Nobody was really willing to say that these videos weren't real, so everyone got legitimately concerned.
39560	47080	And for the first time in a long time, he had a large group of people unabashedly supporting him.
47080	49560	And then he uploaded the final video of the series.
49560	55080	And in this video, he, for lack of a better term, stages a fake suicide.
55080	62200	He takes a gun, puts it up to his head, and then puts in a really obvious gunshot sound effect and blood effect.
62200	67720	And he kills himself in a way that's just completely, insultingly, obviously fake.
67720	75000	And right after that, at the end of the video, he reveals that the whole thing was just his way of raising suicide awareness.
75000	80360	And immediately, once people realized they had been duped, they began turning against him.
80360	87000	There were many people in the community that threw their unconditional support behind Behind the Meme,
87000	92040	and they ended up looking like fools for falling for this fake scheme.
92040	96520	And from a totally impartial perspective, this looks really bad.
96520	103320	It would appear that Behind the Meme took advantage of the serious issues of suicide and depression,
103320	108600	emotionally manipulated his audience, consisting mostly of young children,
108600	112600	into thinking that he was actually endangering himself.
112600	116760	And it would seem that he did all of this for attention.
116760	123880	And it is certainly the most hateable thing he has ever done in his YouTube career.
123880	127960	Getting hated for making mediocre videos about memes is one thing,
127960	133880	but taking advantage of suicide and depression and emotionally manipulating your audience
133880	138200	is something that, for a lot of people, is unforgivable.
138280	142360	And this whole time this video was coming out, I never really bought into it.
142360	146920	I was one of the few people who, throughout the whole ordeal, thought it was fake.
146920	151080	And I was almost certain that this would be the exact outcome,
151080	154360	and Behind the Meme would reveal himself as a fraud.
154360	159960	Because people who thought this was serious were all gearing up, lining up to jump down my throat,
159960	163560	and tar and feather me if anything bad happened to Behind the Meme.
163560	166360	Because as far as most of the community knows,
166360	169640	I'm apparently the guy who ruined Behind the Meme's life.
169640	173880	But I knew that wasn't gonna happen because I knew these videos were fake from the beginning.
173880	176280	So I come out with my statement on Twitter saying this,
177000	181640	and literally a few hours later I get instantly proven correct.
182360	183720	And that was it.
183720	186760	Behind the Meme revealed that the videos were fake the whole time.
187320	188520	And I was right.
188520	190040	And people were turning on him.
190040	191560	And he was getting hated.
191560	196760	And with this outcome in mind, I was so prepared to get up there on my high horse
196760	199080	and dance around on his channel's grave saying,
199080	200040	I told you so.
200040	204120	I was so ready to take all the hate I got from that Behind the Meme video
204120	205720	and say, well, look at this.
205720	207640	Look who was right the whole time.
207640	213240	But then right as Behind the Meme's reputation was just burning down right in front of my eyes,
213240	214760	I didn't feel any gratification.
215560	218520	Everything had gone exactly how I thought it would.
218520	221960	And yet, I didn't feel like I won anything.
221960	227800	And I can't believe I'm saying this, but I actually feel bad for Behind the Meme now.
227800	233240	For the whole time, from when I first started working on the Behind the Meme video,
233240	239480	all the way up until the fake suicide video, I didn't have one bit of sympathy for the guy.
239480	246440	Even as he was being vociferously hated by a group of people that I directly inspired,
246440	248120	I didn't feel sorry for the guy.
248120	254120	But for some reason now, during an event in which it would seem the most justified
254120	257640	to hate Behind the Meme, I actually feel sorry for him.
257640	261560	And the reason for that is the video he uploaded,
261560	269240	where he fictitiously shoots himself in the head, was so unbelievably poorly executed
269240	274760	that I realized that Behind the Meme may have honestly thought in his head
274760	279320	that this was a good idea and that he was supporting a noble cause.
279320	282200	For this whole time I was against Behind the Meme,
282200	287640	it was predicated under the assumption that he had some sort of ulterior motive.
287640	293560	Like he was making videos for money or attention or simply to take advantage of people
293560	295080	or because he was lazy.
295080	300920	But never once did I consider that this guy might just be some fool with a genuinely good heart
300920	306280	who somehow stumbled his way into this position of influence by just sheer dumb luck.
306920	310760	And the more I thought about it, the more I realized that Behind the Meme
310760	316440	this whole time might have just been some naive guy with nothing but good intentions.
317000	322920	I've just become so used to the idea that YouTubers are disingenuous people,
322920	327880	that they all carry around this fake persona where they do nothing but pander to fans
327880	331640	and market themselves and help their personal brand
331640	336920	and wheel and deal behind the scenes to make sure that their channel makes as much money as possible.
336920	341480	And I never considered the possibility that perhaps Behind the Meme isn't any of those things
341480	346280	and what he does and says in his videos is just honestly how he is in real life.
346280	350200	And the more I think about it, the more I believe that it's actually true.
350200	354360	I mean, Behind the Meme doesn't act like other YouTubers.
354360	355640	And with that being said,
355640	360520	the first thing that comes to mind is that he has done no networking whatsoever.
360520	364520	He has never ever spoken to anyone from the meme community
364520	366920	or even the YouTube community for that matter.
366920	371240	He never buttered himself up to any bigger YouTuber when he was trying to get popular.
371240	375800	He literally did everything by himself without any other YouTuber's help or approval.
376440	377880	And when I think of his videos,
378680	382280	even though they tend to carry the appearance of gimmicky clickbait,
382280	386840	he just doesn't seem to employ the same tactics that other sleazy YouTubers use
386840	390920	when they're trying to game the system and only care about views and money.
390920	392920	Sure, his videos may seem padded out,
392920	396840	but he never seemed to stretch all of them out to 10 minutes to get more ad breaks.
396840	401000	He didn't upload every day trying to soak in as many views as possible.
401000	403240	He never really shilled out merchandise.
403240	406200	He never did scammy gift card giveaways.
406200	408840	He didn't do any of that stuff that most YouTubers do
408840	411240	when they only care about money and attention.
411240	414360	It seems like from all the actions of his YouTube career,
414360	420440	Behind the Meme may have just been a guy who simply took satisfaction from making people happy.
421080	425560	And I know his latest series of videos look really bad for him.
425560	429320	But the more I look into it, the more I believe it's true
429320	435400	that Behind the Meme is just a clueless guy with no self-awareness
435400	438760	who was genuinely trying to spread a positive message.
438760	440760	And I don't really know how to feel about that.
440760	442840	He's probably gonna get hammered for this.
442840	445480	People are legitimately gonna hate him for this video.
445480	446840	I guess I just want to say this.
447560	451080	A lot of you out there may really want to hate Behind the Meme for this incident.
451080	452600	And I'm here to say don't.
453400	454440	Don't hate the guy.
454440	455480	Take it from me.
455480	459160	A guy who many people view as Behind the Meme's worst enemy.
459160	464120	His videos might be mediocre and dumb and really poorly thought out,
465160	467000	but it's just not worth hating the guy.
467560	470680	I said this at the beginning of the Behind the Meme video and I'll say it now.
471080	472120	Enough is enough.
472120	476360	It's time to finally put this issue to rest and leave Behind the Meme alone.
