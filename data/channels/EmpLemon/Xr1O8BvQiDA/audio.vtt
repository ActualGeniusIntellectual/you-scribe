00:00.000 --> 00:06.200
Hi everyone, it's me, Emperor Lemon, and I just really wanted to share my thoughts on this issue.

00:06.200 --> 00:11.360
So I'm here to make this video because Behind the Meme did a really bad thing.

00:11.360 --> 00:16.960
Behind the Meme may have just made the worst mistake of his YouTube career.

00:16.960 --> 00:27.160
So for those of you who don't know the whole story, Behind the Meme basically spent a week and a half uploading these cryptic, disturbing series of videos

00:27.160 --> 00:33.480
depicting himself falling into a deep, emotionally disturbed depression.

00:33.480 --> 00:39.560
Nobody was really willing to say that these videos weren't real, so everyone got legitimately concerned.

00:39.560 --> 00:47.080
And for the first time in a long time, he had a large group of people unabashedly supporting him.

00:47.080 --> 00:49.560
And then he uploaded the final video of the series.

00:49.560 --> 00:55.080
And in this video, he, for lack of a better term, stages a fake suicide.

00:55.080 --> 01:02.200
He takes a gun, puts it up to his head, and then puts in a really obvious gunshot sound effect and blood effect.

01:02.200 --> 01:07.720
And he kills himself in a way that's just completely, insultingly, obviously fake.

01:07.720 --> 01:15.000
And right after that, at the end of the video, he reveals that the whole thing was just his way of raising suicide awareness.

01:15.000 --> 01:20.360
And immediately, once people realized they had been duped, they began turning against him.

01:20.360 --> 01:27.000
There were many people in the community that threw their unconditional support behind Behind the Meme,

01:27.000 --> 01:32.040
and they ended up looking like fools for falling for this fake scheme.

01:32.040 --> 01:36.520
And from a totally impartial perspective, this looks really bad.

01:36.520 --> 01:43.320
It would appear that Behind the Meme took advantage of the serious issues of suicide and depression,

01:43.320 --> 01:48.600
emotionally manipulated his audience, consisting mostly of young children,

01:48.600 --> 01:52.600
into thinking that he was actually endangering himself.

01:52.600 --> 01:56.760
And it would seem that he did all of this for attention.

01:56.760 --> 02:03.880
And it is certainly the most hateable thing he has ever done in his YouTube career.

02:03.880 --> 02:07.960
Getting hated for making mediocre videos about memes is one thing,

02:07.960 --> 02:13.880
but taking advantage of suicide and depression and emotionally manipulating your audience

02:13.880 --> 02:18.200
is something that, for a lot of people, is unforgivable.

02:18.280 --> 02:22.360
And this whole time this video was coming out, I never really bought into it.

02:22.360 --> 02:26.920
I was one of the few people who, throughout the whole ordeal, thought it was fake.

02:26.920 --> 02:31.080
And I was almost certain that this would be the exact outcome,

02:31.080 --> 02:34.360
and Behind the Meme would reveal himself as a fraud.

02:34.360 --> 02:39.960
Because people who thought this was serious were all gearing up, lining up to jump down my throat,

02:39.960 --> 02:43.560
and tar and feather me if anything bad happened to Behind the Meme.

02:43.560 --> 02:46.360
Because as far as most of the community knows,

02:46.360 --> 02:49.640
I'm apparently the guy who ruined Behind the Meme's life.

02:49.640 --> 02:53.880
But I knew that wasn't gonna happen because I knew these videos were fake from the beginning.

02:53.880 --> 02:56.280
So I come out with my statement on Twitter saying this,

02:57.000 --> 03:01.640
and literally a few hours later I get instantly proven correct.

03:02.360 --> 03:03.720
And that was it.

03:03.720 --> 03:06.760
Behind the Meme revealed that the videos were fake the whole time.

03:07.320 --> 03:08.520
And I was right.

03:08.520 --> 03:10.040
And people were turning on him.

03:10.040 --> 03:11.560
And he was getting hated.

03:11.560 --> 03:16.760
And with this outcome in mind, I was so prepared to get up there on my high horse

03:16.760 --> 03:19.080
and dance around on his channel's grave saying,

03:19.080 --> 03:20.040
I told you so.

03:20.040 --> 03:24.120
I was so ready to take all the hate I got from that Behind the Meme video

03:24.120 --> 03:25.720
and say, well, look at this.

03:25.720 --> 03:27.640
Look who was right the whole time.

03:27.640 --> 03:33.240
But then right as Behind the Meme's reputation was just burning down right in front of my eyes,

03:33.240 --> 03:34.760
I didn't feel any gratification.

03:35.560 --> 03:38.520
Everything had gone exactly how I thought it would.

03:38.520 --> 03:41.960
And yet, I didn't feel like I won anything.

03:41.960 --> 03:47.800
And I can't believe I'm saying this, but I actually feel bad for Behind the Meme now.

03:47.800 --> 03:53.240
For the whole time, from when I first started working on the Behind the Meme video,

03:53.240 --> 03:59.480
all the way up until the fake suicide video, I didn't have one bit of sympathy for the guy.

03:59.480 --> 04:06.440
Even as he was being vociferously hated by a group of people that I directly inspired,

04:06.440 --> 04:08.120
I didn't feel sorry for the guy.

04:08.120 --> 04:14.120
But for some reason now, during an event in which it would seem the most justified

04:14.120 --> 04:17.640
to hate Behind the Meme, I actually feel sorry for him.

04:17.640 --> 04:21.560
And the reason for that is the video he uploaded,

04:21.560 --> 04:29.240
where he fictitiously shoots himself in the head, was so unbelievably poorly executed

04:29.240 --> 04:34.760
that I realized that Behind the Meme may have honestly thought in his head

04:34.760 --> 04:39.320
that this was a good idea and that he was supporting a noble cause.

04:39.320 --> 04:42.200
For this whole time I was against Behind the Meme,

04:42.200 --> 04:47.640
it was predicated under the assumption that he had some sort of ulterior motive.

04:47.640 --> 04:53.560
Like he was making videos for money or attention or simply to take advantage of people

04:53.560 --> 04:55.080
or because he was lazy.

04:55.080 --> 05:00.920
But never once did I consider that this guy might just be some fool with a genuinely good heart

05:00.920 --> 05:06.280
who somehow stumbled his way into this position of influence by just sheer dumb luck.

05:06.920 --> 05:10.760
And the more I thought about it, the more I realized that Behind the Meme

05:10.760 --> 05:16.440
this whole time might have just been some naive guy with nothing but good intentions.

05:17.000 --> 05:22.920
I've just become so used to the idea that YouTubers are disingenuous people,

05:22.920 --> 05:27.880
that they all carry around this fake persona where they do nothing but pander to fans

05:27.880 --> 05:31.640
and market themselves and help their personal brand

05:31.640 --> 05:36.920
and wheel and deal behind the scenes to make sure that their channel makes as much money as possible.

05:36.920 --> 05:41.480
And I never considered the possibility that perhaps Behind the Meme isn't any of those things

05:41.480 --> 05:46.280
and what he does and says in his videos is just honestly how he is in real life.

05:46.280 --> 05:50.200
And the more I think about it, the more I believe that it's actually true.

05:50.200 --> 05:54.360
I mean, Behind the Meme doesn't act like other YouTubers.

05:54.360 --> 05:55.640
And with that being said,

05:55.640 --> 06:00.520
the first thing that comes to mind is that he has done no networking whatsoever.

06:00.520 --> 06:04.520
He has never ever spoken to anyone from the meme community

06:04.520 --> 06:06.920
or even the YouTube community for that matter.

06:06.920 --> 06:11.240
He never buttered himself up to any bigger YouTuber when he was trying to get popular.

06:11.240 --> 06:15.800
He literally did everything by himself without any other YouTuber's help or approval.

06:16.440 --> 06:17.880
And when I think of his videos,

06:18.680 --> 06:22.280
even though they tend to carry the appearance of gimmicky clickbait,

06:22.280 --> 06:26.840
he just doesn't seem to employ the same tactics that other sleazy YouTubers use

06:26.840 --> 06:30.920
when they're trying to game the system and only care about views and money.

06:30.920 --> 06:32.920
Sure, his videos may seem padded out,

06:32.920 --> 06:36.840
but he never seemed to stretch all of them out to 10 minutes to get more ad breaks.

06:36.840 --> 06:41.000
He didn't upload every day trying to soak in as many views as possible.

06:41.000 --> 06:43.240
He never really shilled out merchandise.

06:43.240 --> 06:46.200
He never did scammy gift card giveaways.

06:46.200 --> 06:48.840
He didn't do any of that stuff that most YouTubers do

06:48.840 --> 06:51.240
when they only care about money and attention.

06:51.240 --> 06:54.360
It seems like from all the actions of his YouTube career,

06:54.360 --> 07:00.440
Behind the Meme may have just been a guy who simply took satisfaction from making people happy.

07:01.080 --> 07:05.560
And I know his latest series of videos look really bad for him.

07:05.560 --> 07:09.320
But the more I look into it, the more I believe it's true

07:09.320 --> 07:15.400
that Behind the Meme is just a clueless guy with no self-awareness

07:15.400 --> 07:18.760
who was genuinely trying to spread a positive message.

07:18.760 --> 07:20.760
And I don't really know how to feel about that.

07:20.760 --> 07:22.840
He's probably gonna get hammered for this.

07:22.840 --> 07:25.480
People are legitimately gonna hate him for this video.

07:25.480 --> 07:26.840
I guess I just want to say this.

07:27.560 --> 07:31.080
A lot of you out there may really want to hate Behind the Meme for this incident.

07:31.080 --> 07:32.600
And I'm here to say don't.

07:33.400 --> 07:34.440
Don't hate the guy.

07:34.440 --> 07:35.480
Take it from me.

07:35.480 --> 07:39.160
A guy who many people view as Behind the Meme's worst enemy.

07:39.160 --> 07:44.120
His videos might be mediocre and dumb and really poorly thought out,

07:45.160 --> 07:47.000
but it's just not worth hating the guy.

07:47.560 --> 07:50.680
I said this at the beginning of the Behind the Meme video and I'll say it now.

07:51.080 --> 07:52.120
Enough is enough.

07:52.120 --> 07:56.360
It's time to finally put this issue to rest and leave Behind the Meme alone.
