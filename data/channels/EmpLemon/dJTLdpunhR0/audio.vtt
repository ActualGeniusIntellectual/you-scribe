00:09.560 --> 00:11.720
What up everybody, it's your boy,

00:11.720 --> 00:13.060
F-lemon!

00:13.060 --> 00:14.060
Here with another

00:14.060 --> 00:17.180
YouTube commentary.

00:17.180 --> 00:19.740
Just make another YTP already!

00:19.740 --> 00:22.500
Today is day 147

00:22.500 --> 00:26.600
of the never-ending Emperor Lemon Downward Spiral World Tourâ€¦

00:26.600 --> 00:28.440
and wait a minuteâ€¦

00:28.440 --> 00:32.440
Can you hear that? You gotta listen very closely.

00:43.720 --> 00:47.240
It's the sound of people clicking unsubscribe.

00:50.440 --> 00:54.840
You know, I've been thinking about subscribers a lot lately. Pretty much everyone on YouTube

00:54.840 --> 01:00.840
takes this idea for granted, but I've been seriously asking myself the question lately of

01:00.840 --> 01:05.320
what is a subscriber? It seems like a pretty straightforward question, but I find that the

01:05.320 --> 01:10.280
more you think about it, the wider it opens up a can of worms. So everybody buckle your

01:10.280 --> 01:13.320
fuckles because we're about to go anal into analytics.

01:13.320 --> 01:27.400
So the way I see it, one subscriber on YouTube represents one potential view.

01:27.400 --> 01:32.120
Now in a perfect world, each video you upload should reach a number of views equal to your

01:32.120 --> 01:38.200
channel's current subscriber count, plus views from any new viewers. This obviously doesn't

01:38.200 --> 01:43.320
actually happen. I mean, just look at my channel. My sub count says this big ol' number,

01:43.320 --> 01:50.520
while my video views are closer to, uh, these less impressive numbers. How can this be? Has the

01:50.520 --> 01:56.200
downward spiral gone too far? Is Shrek responsible? Does this mean that the almighty YouTube

01:56.200 --> 02:07.320
subscriber count isn't actually real? Oh no, that subscriber count is my YouTube dick.

02:08.200 --> 02:14.920
I need to wave it around and impress people. How will people know how cool I am unless they

02:14.920 --> 02:21.880
identify my bonafide six figure sub count? How come my sub count looks like this,

02:21.880 --> 02:34.600
but my view count looks like this? Ladies and gentlemen, I present to you the concept of what

02:34.600 --> 02:40.040
I like to call empty subscribers. I get it from the term empty calories. You know when you eat a

02:40.040 --> 02:45.400
smooth shiny glazed donut and how good it tastes? Well, it shouldn't because you, my friend, are

02:45.400 --> 02:51.400
eating a mouthful of empty calories. There ain't no nutrition in that tasty Taurus. Nutrition? Not

02:51.400 --> 02:56.680
for me! It's fried dough with sugar and it's gonna make you constipated because there's no fiber.

02:56.680 --> 03:01.160
And if you eat more of them, you're gonna get diabetes. And if you eat more than that,

03:01.160 --> 03:07.880
you're gonna have to wash myself with a rag on a stick. Sticks out for diabetes. But that doesn't

03:07.880 --> 03:12.760
change the fact that donuts taste really fucking good. And that's what a big sub count does to

03:12.760 --> 03:17.880
YouTubers. It looks really fucking good. But therein lies the problem. Not all delicious

03:17.880 --> 03:22.840
food is nutritious and not all subscribers actually watch your videos. When people compare

03:22.840 --> 03:28.680
YouTube channels, they often tend to look at the raw data. The almighty sub count. The ultimate

03:28.680 --> 03:33.400
dick measuring contest. Non-YouTubers won't relate to this, but that number right below

03:33.400 --> 03:39.320
your channel name is the embodiment of your ego. It's your YouTube dick length. And I see your

03:39.320 --> 03:45.080
shorts is as big as mine. Nobody admits to this, but every YouTuber secretly resents other channels

03:45.080 --> 03:50.200
with more subscribers than them. This isn't necessarily a negative attribute. It's human

03:50.200 --> 03:54.920
nature to want to be the best in the world at every single thing you attempt. Especially at

03:54.920 --> 03:59.800
making vapid video content for children on the internet. But sometimes we lose track of what

03:59.800 --> 04:08.840
that subscriber count actually means. It's not just the score in a game. That number represents

04:08.840 --> 04:14.760
a quantity of real, living, breathing human beings with personalities and opinions just like you or

04:14.760 --> 04:19.320
me. I feel like a lot of YouTubers somewhat know this, but they don't actually grasp the bigger

04:19.320 --> 04:23.960
picture. A subscriber is not a robot who will respond with the exact same output to every

04:23.960 --> 04:35.480
input. Uh, most subscribers that is. A YouTube subscriber is a human being capable of applying

04:35.480 --> 04:40.520
critical thinking and making decisions. Obviously every human thinks in slightly different ways,

04:40.520 --> 04:45.400
so therefore each individual subscriber in your sub count is a distinct entity completely

04:45.400 --> 04:50.200
independent from the rest of the subscribers. Most of the time it's really difficult to remain

04:50.200 --> 04:54.840
cognizant of this fact because when you look at that subscriber number, that's all you see.

04:54.840 --> 04:59.400
A number. You never actually get to see the people behind it. You don't get to know who they are,

04:59.400 --> 05:04.200
what they look like, their age, gender, favorite color, whether or not they like pineapple on

05:04.200 --> 05:07.560
pizza. I probably shouldn't have said that last part because now half the comments are going to

05:07.560 --> 05:15.400
be debating whether or not pineapple on pizza is tasty. Personally I think it's disgusting.

05:15.400 --> 05:21.160
But anyway for about 99% of subscribers it's a one-way street. They watch my videos and I get

05:21.160 --> 05:25.560
no insight into anything about them. The only reasonable inference I can make about them is

05:25.560 --> 05:30.600
that they enjoyed at least one of my videos at one time. That's it. Besides that it's almost as

05:30.600 --> 05:35.560
if they don't even exist to me. It's like the idea where if an ogre shits in the woods and no one's

05:35.560 --> 05:41.000
around to smell it, does it stink? And for those of you who actively watch and comment on my videos,

05:41.000 --> 05:45.720
I just want to say that I really appreciate that. It's the only tangible information I receive that

05:45.720 --> 05:52.600
conveys the idea that I have a real audience. But what about the rest? The 80% of my subscriber base

05:52.600 --> 05:58.200
who don't actually watch my videos? Are they even subscribers at that point? I'll admit it,

05:58.200 --> 06:03.160
I've acquired a lot of empty subscribers over the years, but that's okay. First of all because

06:03.160 --> 06:09.480
YouTube is not my job. And also because my videos have been constantly changing every single year

06:09.480 --> 06:14.280
since I started on this website. If you look at all the videos on my channel and find any two

06:14.280 --> 06:18.360
that are just one year apart, they're going to be completely stylistically different. Hell,

06:18.360 --> 06:23.560
my videos have become so different in this past year that my channel is almost unrecognizable

06:23.560 --> 06:29.720
from even a year ago. Maybe, I may be. Remember that you are the H? Yeah, this is the type of

06:29.720 --> 06:33.800
things that alienate subscribers. Because like I've said a million times already, a subscriber

06:33.800 --> 06:38.600
is a real life human. And most real life humans are picky towards the content they enjoy. For

06:38.600 --> 06:43.080
something as subjective as YouTube poop, it's pretty much impossible to keep a majority of

06:43.080 --> 06:47.000
you guys satisfied. And now that I've started producing content that isn't really YouTube

06:47.000 --> 06:52.440
poop at all, well, I guess you could say that my sub count has been on a downward spiral recently

06:52.440 --> 06:57.240
and now I've lost thousands of subscribers completely. 39,000 actually. At least at the

06:57.240 --> 07:00.600
time of recording this video. That number is probably going to go up after I upload this,

07:00.600 --> 07:05.560
but I'm not going to rag on these people. Believe it or not, I actually support these guys.

07:05.560 --> 07:11.880
They get a thumbs up from me. What I don't like is when people stay subscribed to me and just do

07:12.760 --> 07:17.880
nothing. There's a misconception on this website that a big subscriber count automatically equates

07:17.880 --> 07:22.200
to popularity. And while that may sound quite intuitive, it's not exactly accurate.

07:22.840 --> 07:27.320
What you really have to consider when judging a YouTube channel's popularity is to look at the

07:27.320 --> 07:32.600
empty subscribers. How many people are subscribed to this channel who aren't watching their videos?

07:32.600 --> 07:37.160
Let's look at the YouTube channels Vsauce and WatchMojo, channels which have relatively

07:37.160 --> 07:42.600
similar subscriber counts. Vsauce has about 11 million subscribers and their newest videos

07:42.600 --> 07:55.560
are averaging about 5 million views each. WatchMojo on the other hand has about 2 million

07:55.560 --> 08:00.520
more subscribers than Vsauce. However, none of their most recent videos have even managed to

08:00.520 --> 08:05.160
break 1 million views and a majority of them have fewer than 200,000 views.

08:14.920 --> 08:20.760
So is it really fair to say that WatchMojo is more popular than Vsauce when each Vsauce video

08:20.760 --> 08:25.640
has 100 times as many views as the average WatchMojo upload? Now obviously these channels

08:25.640 --> 08:30.360
have really different approaches to making content. Vsauce features highly polished,

08:30.360 --> 08:34.840
well-researched videos which take months to produce. WatchMojo's business model is just

08:36.040 --> 08:41.640
PUMP OUT AS MANY FUCKING VIDEOS AS HUMANLY POSSIBLE! GO! GO FASTER GOD DAMN IT!

08:41.640 --> 08:47.560
But we're all out of ideas. Are you? Yeah? ARE YOU? We've literally made a top 10 list

08:47.560 --> 08:55.880
on every- ARE YOU? Oh, a new idea!

09:00.760 --> 09:03.880
Top 10 Canadian Actor Mustaches of the 80s!

09:17.560 --> 09:23.400
BOGER! IT'S NEVER BOGER! IT'S NEVER BOGER! IT'S NEVER BOGER! IT'S NEVER BOGER!

09:23.400 --> 09:27.880
DOWN FOR A SMILING!

09:30.920 --> 09:41.880
FUCK YOU BOLTIMORE! IF YOU'RE TUMB ENOUGH TO BUY A NEW CAR THIS WEEKEND!

09:41.880 --> 09:50.520
So because of this, WatchMojo has way more empty subscribers than Vsauce. I don't know about the

09:50.520 --> 09:55.640
rest of you guys, but I consider Vsauce to be a more popular YouTube channel than WatchMojo.

09:55.640 --> 09:59.880
Even though WatchMojo has more subscribers and gets more total views than Vsauce,

09:59.880 --> 10:05.400
each new Vsauce upload is more relevant. It may not be intuitive, but this is the information

10:05.400 --> 10:10.440
you must consider when evaluating the actual popularity of a YouTube channel. You can try

10:10.440 --> 10:14.680
to think about it this way. Would you evaluate a person's health by looking at a person's weight?

10:14.680 --> 10:19.960
Not looking at the person themselves, but just judging their health based on a numerical value

10:19.960 --> 10:24.360
of their weight. Sure, you can make some inferences, but you couldn't reach a definitive conclusion

10:24.360 --> 10:29.240
using only that information. That's sort of my same process when judging YouTube channels.

10:29.240 --> 10:34.680
The raw sub count is a channel's weight, its mass, but you need to know what that mass is made of

10:34.680 --> 10:40.280
before you can judge the health of a channel. A 280 pound man could be a super athletic strongman,

10:41.240 --> 10:46.200
but they could also be a fat piece of shit. You can't tell without actually looking at their bodies.

10:46.200 --> 10:50.360
Likewise, you can't judge a YouTube channel's true popularity without looking at the types of

10:50.360 --> 10:55.240
subscribers which compose that channel. You have to ask yourself, are these subscribers actually

10:55.240 --> 10:59.400
invested in the YouTuber's content, or are they just there for a cheap thrill and a slap on the

10:59.400 --> 11:06.280
dick? This is an epiphany I made about a year and a half ago. At this time, my channel was at its peak

11:06.280 --> 11:11.880
in raw popularity. My videos were hot commodities. Every video I uploaded would get over 100,000

11:11.880 --> 11:17.000
views in a couple weeks, and at my peak I was gaining about 5,000 subs per month. Sounds pretty

11:17.000 --> 11:21.080
sweet, right? How the hell could someone be dissatisfied with those numbers? Well, like I've

11:21.080 --> 11:25.240
been saying, I look beyond the numbers. You guys may not believe this, but I try to read all of

11:25.240 --> 11:29.960
my comments. If you've ever posted a comment on any of my videos, chances are I've read it. I

11:29.960 --> 11:34.280
don't just read the comments on an individual basis though. I consider them collectively to

11:34.760 --> 11:39.960
gauge the mood and tone of the audience. And around the time of my peak popularity,

11:39.960 --> 11:44.040
something just felt off about my audience based on the comments I was receiving at the time.

11:44.040 --> 11:48.360
Believe it or not, there used to be a long time ago when my videos' comments weren't the complete

11:48.360 --> 11:53.240
scourge of humanity. Way back then, the majority of the comments on my videos were actually quite

11:53.240 --> 11:57.720
constructive and insightful observations. And while those types of comments have never truly

11:57.720 --> 12:02.600
disappeared, they've just been drowned out over the years by the obnoxious shouting contests that

12:02.600 --> 12:06.760
try as desperately as possible to get your attention. The vast majority of my comments

12:06.760 --> 12:12.680
just became, LOL, or some random quote from the video. Just really juvenile and impulsive shit.

12:12.680 --> 12:17.400
I began to get the heavy sensation that a large portion of my audience didn't actually respect me

12:17.400 --> 12:22.840
and just wanted a cheap thrill. This dawned on me whenever I made the slightest change in my style,

12:22.840 --> 12:28.040
and I would be continually met with larger and larger amounts of remedial criticism like,

12:28.600 --> 12:33.960
THIS IS SHIT. Oh, side rant by the way, if you're gonna criticize a video on the internet,

12:33.960 --> 12:39.480
please elaborate beyond saying, THIS IS SHIT. I've had this comment about a hundred times now,

12:39.480 --> 12:44.040
and I know whoever posts these think they're being so edgy and rebellious and cool,

12:44.040 --> 12:49.560
but when an actual rational person sees your comment, they're basically seeing a giant stamp

12:49.560 --> 12:55.080
on your forehead that says, my IQ is lower than my chromosome count. So next time you say something

12:55.080 --> 13:03.080
is shit, please explain why. Anyway, in about early 2015, my subscriber base was at its most

13:03.080 --> 13:07.480
ravenous and least appreciative, and during this time I felt a tremendous pressure to keep my

13:07.480 --> 13:12.200
videos at a certain standard, or else the fans would get upset. And it was during this time when

13:12.200 --> 13:17.000
I began to stop enjoying making YouTube poops. It came to a point where I had to stop for a moment

13:17.000 --> 13:22.280
and think about the state of my YouTube channel. I had to tell myself, look, you aren't having fun

13:22.280 --> 13:27.320
making these videos anymore, but you're gaining a shitload of subscribers, so you can either keep

13:27.320 --> 13:32.360
making these long, polished videos and continue growing, or you can go back to having fun but

13:32.360 --> 13:37.080
piss off a lot of people. Ultimately, my decision came down to the quality of the subscribers

13:37.080 --> 13:41.720
themselves. Did I really want to continue entertaining a bunch of prepubescent children

13:41.720 --> 13:46.040
who don't actually respect me as a person, and instead view my YouTube channel as nothing more

13:46.040 --> 13:51.160
than a Skinner box of autistic video content? Did I really want to continue making videos for

13:51.160 --> 13:55.640
people who would turn on me at even the slightest level of dissatisfaction? Did I really want to

13:55.640 --> 14:00.840
have a fan base composed mostly of people who I would never actually talk to in real life?

14:00.840 --> 14:09.080
My answer to all these questions was no, nope, and at that moment I hit the brakes on this channel

14:09.080 --> 14:13.240
and nothing was ever the same. Some would say that that was the beginning of the end,

14:13.240 --> 14:17.720
that that was the point of me slipping over the precipice of the downward spiral. Others would

14:17.720 --> 14:22.520
say that the chains were off, and that I had descended completely. Regardless, as soon as I

14:22.520 --> 14:27.400
made this decision, a vast majority of my subscribers became empty subscribers. I didn't

14:27.400 --> 14:32.280
even have to upload a new video for this to be the case. It happened as soon as I made the decision.

14:32.280 --> 14:37.080
The majority of my subscribers at this time would not watch anything I made unless it was

14:37.080 --> 14:41.400
Spongebob or Pixar YouTube Poop, and there's nothing I could have done about it. It was

14:41.400 --> 14:46.680
inevitable. So my channel has a bunch of empty subscribers now. It's fat. It's fat! It needs to go on a

14:46.680 --> 14:52.120
diet. This is why I've been telling people to unsubscribe 125 times if they don't like my

14:52.120 --> 14:56.680
content. I want to get rid of the empty subscribers. I want my subscriber count to

14:56.680 --> 15:02.760
actually be reflective of the amount of people who watch my videos. But alas, the empty subscribers

15:02.760 --> 15:07.160
don't watch my new videos and they never quite get the memo. I can lure some of them out by

15:07.160 --> 15:11.640
sending traps like this, and I know a lot of you view this as a giant fuck you to the audience,

15:11.640 --> 15:16.040
but you gotta believe me in saying that all I wanted to do was get rid of the empty subscribers.

15:16.040 --> 15:20.440
But even that barely worked, so I guess I'm just gonna have a shitload of subscribers who don't

15:20.440 --> 15:24.920
watch my new videos but won't unsubscribe either, and they're just gonna stay there in subscriber

15:24.920 --> 15:27.720
purgatory... forever.

15:27.720 --> 15:47.400
But hey, that's just a spiral! A downward spiral! Thanks for unsubscribing!

15:57.720 --> 16:08.680
The only thing that's for sure about implemen is this is shit.
