9560	11720	What up everybody, it's your boy,
11720	13060	F-lemon!
13060	14060	Here with another
14060	17180	YouTube commentary.
17180	19740	Just make another YTP already!
19740	22500	Today is day 147
22500	26600	of the never-ending Emperor Lemon Downward Spiral World Tourâ€¦
26600	28440	and wait a minuteâ€¦
28440	32440	Can you hear that? You gotta listen very closely.
43720	47240	It's the sound of people clicking unsubscribe.
50440	54840	You know, I've been thinking about subscribers a lot lately. Pretty much everyone on YouTube
54840	60840	takes this idea for granted, but I've been seriously asking myself the question lately of
60840	65320	what is a subscriber? It seems like a pretty straightforward question, but I find that the
65320	70280	more you think about it, the wider it opens up a can of worms. So everybody buckle your
70280	73320	fuckles because we're about to go anal into analytics.
73320	87400	So the way I see it, one subscriber on YouTube represents one potential view.
87400	92120	Now in a perfect world, each video you upload should reach a number of views equal to your
92120	98200	channel's current subscriber count, plus views from any new viewers. This obviously doesn't
98200	103320	actually happen. I mean, just look at my channel. My sub count says this big ol' number,
103320	110520	while my video views are closer to, uh, these less impressive numbers. How can this be? Has the
110520	116200	downward spiral gone too far? Is Shrek responsible? Does this mean that the almighty YouTube
116200	127320	subscriber count isn't actually real? Oh no, that subscriber count is my YouTube dick.
128200	134920	I need to wave it around and impress people. How will people know how cool I am unless they
134920	141880	identify my bonafide six figure sub count? How come my sub count looks like this,
141880	154600	but my view count looks like this? Ladies and gentlemen, I present to you the concept of what
154600	160040	I like to call empty subscribers. I get it from the term empty calories. You know when you eat a
160040	165400	smooth shiny glazed donut and how good it tastes? Well, it shouldn't because you, my friend, are
165400	171400	eating a mouthful of empty calories. There ain't no nutrition in that tasty Taurus. Nutrition? Not
171400	176680	for me! It's fried dough with sugar and it's gonna make you constipated because there's no fiber.
176680	181160	And if you eat more of them, you're gonna get diabetes. And if you eat more than that,
181160	187880	you're gonna have to wash myself with a rag on a stick. Sticks out for diabetes. But that doesn't
187880	192760	change the fact that donuts taste really fucking good. And that's what a big sub count does to
192760	197880	YouTubers. It looks really fucking good. But therein lies the problem. Not all delicious
197880	202840	food is nutritious and not all subscribers actually watch your videos. When people compare
202840	208680	YouTube channels, they often tend to look at the raw data. The almighty sub count. The ultimate
208680	213400	dick measuring contest. Non-YouTubers won't relate to this, but that number right below
213400	219320	your channel name is the embodiment of your ego. It's your YouTube dick length. And I see your
219320	225080	shorts is as big as mine. Nobody admits to this, but every YouTuber secretly resents other channels
225080	230200	with more subscribers than them. This isn't necessarily a negative attribute. It's human
230200	234920	nature to want to be the best in the world at every single thing you attempt. Especially at
234920	239800	making vapid video content for children on the internet. But sometimes we lose track of what
239800	248840	that subscriber count actually means. It's not just the score in a game. That number represents
248840	254760	a quantity of real, living, breathing human beings with personalities and opinions just like you or
254760	259320	me. I feel like a lot of YouTubers somewhat know this, but they don't actually grasp the bigger
259320	263960	picture. A subscriber is not a robot who will respond with the exact same output to every
263960	275480	input. Uh, most subscribers that is. A YouTube subscriber is a human being capable of applying
275480	280520	critical thinking and making decisions. Obviously every human thinks in slightly different ways,
280520	285400	so therefore each individual subscriber in your sub count is a distinct entity completely
285400	290200	independent from the rest of the subscribers. Most of the time it's really difficult to remain
290200	294840	cognizant of this fact because when you look at that subscriber number, that's all you see.
294840	299400	A number. You never actually get to see the people behind it. You don't get to know who they are,
299400	304200	what they look like, their age, gender, favorite color, whether or not they like pineapple on
304200	307560	pizza. I probably shouldn't have said that last part because now half the comments are going to
307560	315400	be debating whether or not pineapple on pizza is tasty. Personally I think it's disgusting.
315400	321160	But anyway for about 99% of subscribers it's a one-way street. They watch my videos and I get
321160	325560	no insight into anything about them. The only reasonable inference I can make about them is
325560	330600	that they enjoyed at least one of my videos at one time. That's it. Besides that it's almost as
330600	335560	if they don't even exist to me. It's like the idea where if an ogre shits in the woods and no one's
335560	341000	around to smell it, does it stink? And for those of you who actively watch and comment on my videos,
341000	345720	I just want to say that I really appreciate that. It's the only tangible information I receive that
345720	352600	conveys the idea that I have a real audience. But what about the rest? The 80% of my subscriber base
352600	358200	who don't actually watch my videos? Are they even subscribers at that point? I'll admit it,
358200	363160	I've acquired a lot of empty subscribers over the years, but that's okay. First of all because
363160	369480	YouTube is not my job. And also because my videos have been constantly changing every single year
369480	374280	since I started on this website. If you look at all the videos on my channel and find any two
374280	378360	that are just one year apart, they're going to be completely stylistically different. Hell,
378360	383560	my videos have become so different in this past year that my channel is almost unrecognizable
383560	389720	from even a year ago. Maybe, I may be. Remember that you are the H? Yeah, this is the type of
389720	393800	things that alienate subscribers. Because like I've said a million times already, a subscriber
393800	398600	is a real life human. And most real life humans are picky towards the content they enjoy. For
398600	403080	something as subjective as YouTube poop, it's pretty much impossible to keep a majority of
403080	407000	you guys satisfied. And now that I've started producing content that isn't really YouTube
407000	412440	poop at all, well, I guess you could say that my sub count has been on a downward spiral recently
412440	417240	and now I've lost thousands of subscribers completely. 39,000 actually. At least at the
417240	420600	time of recording this video. That number is probably going to go up after I upload this,
420600	425560	but I'm not going to rag on these people. Believe it or not, I actually support these guys.
425560	431880	They get a thumbs up from me. What I don't like is when people stay subscribed to me and just do
432760	437880	nothing. There's a misconception on this website that a big subscriber count automatically equates
437880	442200	to popularity. And while that may sound quite intuitive, it's not exactly accurate.
442840	447320	What you really have to consider when judging a YouTube channel's popularity is to look at the
447320	452600	empty subscribers. How many people are subscribed to this channel who aren't watching their videos?
452600	457160	Let's look at the YouTube channels Vsauce and WatchMojo, channels which have relatively
457160	462600	similar subscriber counts. Vsauce has about 11 million subscribers and their newest videos
462600	475560	are averaging about 5 million views each. WatchMojo on the other hand has about 2 million
475560	480520	more subscribers than Vsauce. However, none of their most recent videos have even managed to
480520	485160	break 1 million views and a majority of them have fewer than 200,000 views.
494920	500760	So is it really fair to say that WatchMojo is more popular than Vsauce when each Vsauce video
500760	505640	has 100 times as many views as the average WatchMojo upload? Now obviously these channels
505640	510360	have really different approaches to making content. Vsauce features highly polished,
510360	514840	well-researched videos which take months to produce. WatchMojo's business model is just
516040	521640	PUMP OUT AS MANY FUCKING VIDEOS AS HUMANLY POSSIBLE! GO! GO FASTER GOD DAMN IT!
521640	527560	But we're all out of ideas. Are you? Yeah? ARE YOU? We've literally made a top 10 list
527560	535880	on every- ARE YOU? Oh, a new idea!
540760	543880	Top 10 Canadian Actor Mustaches of the 80s!
557560	563400	BOGER! IT'S NEVER BOGER! IT'S NEVER BOGER! IT'S NEVER BOGER! IT'S NEVER BOGER!
563400	567880	DOWN FOR A SMILING!
570920	581880	FUCK YOU BOLTIMORE! IF YOU'RE TUMB ENOUGH TO BUY A NEW CAR THIS WEEKEND!
581880	590520	So because of this, WatchMojo has way more empty subscribers than Vsauce. I don't know about the
590520	595640	rest of you guys, but I consider Vsauce to be a more popular YouTube channel than WatchMojo.
595640	599880	Even though WatchMojo has more subscribers and gets more total views than Vsauce,
599880	605400	each new Vsauce upload is more relevant. It may not be intuitive, but this is the information
605400	610440	you must consider when evaluating the actual popularity of a YouTube channel. You can try
610440	614680	to think about it this way. Would you evaluate a person's health by looking at a person's weight?
614680	619960	Not looking at the person themselves, but just judging their health based on a numerical value
619960	624360	of their weight. Sure, you can make some inferences, but you couldn't reach a definitive conclusion
624360	629240	using only that information. That's sort of my same process when judging YouTube channels.
629240	634680	The raw sub count is a channel's weight, its mass, but you need to know what that mass is made of
634680	640280	before you can judge the health of a channel. A 280 pound man could be a super athletic strongman,
641240	646200	but they could also be a fat piece of shit. You can't tell without actually looking at their bodies.
646200	650360	Likewise, you can't judge a YouTube channel's true popularity without looking at the types of
650360	655240	subscribers which compose that channel. You have to ask yourself, are these subscribers actually
655240	659400	invested in the YouTuber's content, or are they just there for a cheap thrill and a slap on the
659400	666280	dick? This is an epiphany I made about a year and a half ago. At this time, my channel was at its peak
666280	671880	in raw popularity. My videos were hot commodities. Every video I uploaded would get over 100,000
671880	677000	views in a couple weeks, and at my peak I was gaining about 5,000 subs per month. Sounds pretty
677000	681080	sweet, right? How the hell could someone be dissatisfied with those numbers? Well, like I've
681080	685240	been saying, I look beyond the numbers. You guys may not believe this, but I try to read all of
685240	689960	my comments. If you've ever posted a comment on any of my videos, chances are I've read it. I
689960	694280	don't just read the comments on an individual basis though. I consider them collectively to
694760	699960	gauge the mood and tone of the audience. And around the time of my peak popularity,
699960	704040	something just felt off about my audience based on the comments I was receiving at the time.
704040	708360	Believe it or not, there used to be a long time ago when my videos' comments weren't the complete
708360	713240	scourge of humanity. Way back then, the majority of the comments on my videos were actually quite
713240	717720	constructive and insightful observations. And while those types of comments have never truly
717720	722600	disappeared, they've just been drowned out over the years by the obnoxious shouting contests that
722600	726760	try as desperately as possible to get your attention. The vast majority of my comments
726760	732680	just became, LOL, or some random quote from the video. Just really juvenile and impulsive shit.
732680	737400	I began to get the heavy sensation that a large portion of my audience didn't actually respect me
737400	742840	and just wanted a cheap thrill. This dawned on me whenever I made the slightest change in my style,
742840	748040	and I would be continually met with larger and larger amounts of remedial criticism like,
748600	753960	THIS IS SHIT. Oh, side rant by the way, if you're gonna criticize a video on the internet,
753960	759480	please elaborate beyond saying, THIS IS SHIT. I've had this comment about a hundred times now,
759480	764040	and I know whoever posts these think they're being so edgy and rebellious and cool,
764040	769560	but when an actual rational person sees your comment, they're basically seeing a giant stamp
769560	775080	on your forehead that says, my IQ is lower than my chromosome count. So next time you say something
775080	783080	is shit, please explain why. Anyway, in about early 2015, my subscriber base was at its most
783080	787480	ravenous and least appreciative, and during this time I felt a tremendous pressure to keep my
787480	792200	videos at a certain standard, or else the fans would get upset. And it was during this time when
792200	797000	I began to stop enjoying making YouTube poops. It came to a point where I had to stop for a moment
797000	802280	and think about the state of my YouTube channel. I had to tell myself, look, you aren't having fun
802280	807320	making these videos anymore, but you're gaining a shitload of subscribers, so you can either keep
807320	812360	making these long, polished videos and continue growing, or you can go back to having fun but
812360	817080	piss off a lot of people. Ultimately, my decision came down to the quality of the subscribers
817080	821720	themselves. Did I really want to continue entertaining a bunch of prepubescent children
821720	826040	who don't actually respect me as a person, and instead view my YouTube channel as nothing more
826040	831160	than a Skinner box of autistic video content? Did I really want to continue making videos for
831160	835640	people who would turn on me at even the slightest level of dissatisfaction? Did I really want to
835640	840840	have a fan base composed mostly of people who I would never actually talk to in real life?
840840	849080	My answer to all these questions was no, nope, and at that moment I hit the brakes on this channel
849080	853240	and nothing was ever the same. Some would say that that was the beginning of the end,
853240	857720	that that was the point of me slipping over the precipice of the downward spiral. Others would
857720	862520	say that the chains were off, and that I had descended completely. Regardless, as soon as I
862520	867400	made this decision, a vast majority of my subscribers became empty subscribers. I didn't
867400	872280	even have to upload a new video for this to be the case. It happened as soon as I made the decision.
872280	877080	The majority of my subscribers at this time would not watch anything I made unless it was
877080	881400	Spongebob or Pixar YouTube Poop, and there's nothing I could have done about it. It was
881400	886680	inevitable. So my channel has a bunch of empty subscribers now. It's fat. It's fat! It needs to go on a
886680	892120	diet. This is why I've been telling people to unsubscribe 125 times if they don't like my
892120	896680	content. I want to get rid of the empty subscribers. I want my subscriber count to
896680	902760	actually be reflective of the amount of people who watch my videos. But alas, the empty subscribers
902760	907160	don't watch my new videos and they never quite get the memo. I can lure some of them out by
907160	911640	sending traps like this, and I know a lot of you view this as a giant fuck you to the audience,
911640	916040	but you gotta believe me in saying that all I wanted to do was get rid of the empty subscribers.
916040	920440	But even that barely worked, so I guess I'm just gonna have a shitload of subscribers who don't
920440	924920	watch my new videos but won't unsubscribe either, and they're just gonna stay there in subscriber
924920	927720	purgatory... forever.
927720	947400	But hey, that's just a spiral! A downward spiral! Thanks for unsubscribing!
957720	968680	The only thing that's for sure about implemen is this is shit.
