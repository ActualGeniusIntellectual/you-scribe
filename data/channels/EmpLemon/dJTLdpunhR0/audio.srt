00:00:09,560 --> 00:00:11,720
What up everybody, it's your boy,

3
00:00:11,720 --> 00:00:13,060
F-lemon!

4
00:00:13,060 --> 00:00:14,060
Here with another

5
00:00:14,060 --> 00:00:17,180
YouTube commentary.

6
00:00:17,180 --> 00:00:19,740
Just make another YTP already!

7
00:00:19,740 --> 00:00:22,500
Today is day 147

8
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:26,600
of the never-ending Emperor Lemon Downward Spiral World Tour…

9
00:00:26,600 --> 00:00:28,440
and wait a minute…

10
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:32,440
Can you hear that? You gotta listen very closely.

11
00:00:43,720 --> 00:00:47,240
It's the sound of people clicking unsubscribe.

12
00:00:50,440 --> 00:00:54,840
You know, I've been thinking about subscribers a lot lately. Pretty much everyone on YouTube

13
00:00:54,840 --> 00:01:00,840
takes this idea for granted, but I've been seriously asking myself the question lately of

14
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:05,320
what is a subscriber? It seems like a pretty straightforward question, but I find that the

15
00:01:05,320 --> 00:01:10,280
more you think about it, the wider it opens up a can of worms. So everybody buckle your

16
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:13,320
fuckles because we're about to go anal into analytics.

17
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:27,400
So the way I see it, one subscriber on YouTube represents one potential view.

18
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:32,120
Now in a perfect world, each video you upload should reach a number of views equal to your

19
00:01:32,120 --> 00:01:38,200
channel's current subscriber count, plus views from any new viewers. This obviously doesn't

20
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:43,320
actually happen. I mean, just look at my channel. My sub count says this big ol' number,

21
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:50,520
while my video views are closer to, uh, these less impressive numbers. How can this be? Has the

22
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:56,200
downward spiral gone too far? Is Shrek responsible? Does this mean that the almighty YouTube

23
00:01:56,200 --> 00:02:07,320
subscriber count isn't actually real? Oh no, that subscriber count is my YouTube dick.

24
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:14,920
I need to wave it around and impress people. How will people know how cool I am unless they

25
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:21,880
identify my bonafide six figure sub count? How come my sub count looks like this,

26
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:34,600
but my view count looks like this? Ladies and gentlemen, I present to you the concept of what

27
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:40,040
I like to call empty subscribers. I get it from the term empty calories. You know when you eat a

28
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:45,400
smooth shiny glazed donut and how good it tastes? Well, it shouldn't because you, my friend, are

29
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:51,400
eating a mouthful of empty calories. There ain't no nutrition in that tasty Taurus. Nutrition? Not

30
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:56,680
for me! It's fried dough with sugar and it's gonna make you constipated because there's no fiber.

31
00:02:56,680 --> 00:03:01,160
And if you eat more of them, you're gonna get diabetes. And if you eat more than that,

32
00:03:01,160 --> 00:03:07,880
you're gonna have to wash myself with a rag on a stick. Sticks out for diabetes. But that doesn't

33
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:12,760
change the fact that donuts taste really fucking good. And that's what a big sub count does to

34
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:17,880
YouTubers. It looks really fucking good. But therein lies the problem. Not all delicious

35
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:22,840
food is nutritious and not all subscribers actually watch your videos. When people compare

36
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:28,680
YouTube channels, they often tend to look at the raw data. The almighty sub count. The ultimate

37
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:33,400
dick measuring contest. Non-YouTubers won't relate to this, but that number right below

38
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:39,320
your channel name is the embodiment of your ego. It's your YouTube dick length. And I see your

39
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:45,080
shorts is as big as mine. Nobody admits to this, but every YouTuber secretly resents other channels

40
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:50,200
with more subscribers than them. This isn't necessarily a negative attribute. It's human

41
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:54,920
nature to want to be the best in the world at every single thing you attempt. Especially at

42
00:03:54,920 --> 00:03:59,800
making vapid video content for children on the internet. But sometimes we lose track of what

43
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:08,840
that subscriber count actually means. It's not just the score in a game. That number represents

44
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:14,760
a quantity of real, living, breathing human beings with personalities and opinions just like you or

45
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:19,320
me. I feel like a lot of YouTubers somewhat know this, but they don't actually grasp the bigger

46
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:23,960
picture. A subscriber is not a robot who will respond with the exact same output to every

47
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:35,480
input. Uh, most subscribers that is. A YouTube subscriber is a human being capable of applying

48
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:40,520
critical thinking and making decisions. Obviously every human thinks in slightly different ways,

49
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:45,400
so therefore each individual subscriber in your sub count is a distinct entity completely

50
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:50,200
independent from the rest of the subscribers. Most of the time it's really difficult to remain

51
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:54,840
cognizant of this fact because when you look at that subscriber number, that's all you see.

52
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:59,400
A number. You never actually get to see the people behind it. You don't get to know who they are,

53
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:04,200
what they look like, their age, gender, favorite color, whether or not they like pineapple on

54
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:07,560
pizza. I probably shouldn't have said that last part because now half the comments are going to

55
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:15,400
be debating whether or not pineapple on pizza is tasty. Personally I think it's disgusting.

56
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:21,160
But anyway for about 99% of subscribers it's a one-way street. They watch my videos and I get

57
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:25,560
no insight into anything about them. The only reasonable inference I can make about them is

58
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:30,600
that they enjoyed at least one of my videos at one time. That's it. Besides that it's almost as

59
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:35,560
if they don't even exist to me. It's like the idea where if an ogre shits in the woods and no one's

60
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:41,000
around to smell it, does it stink? And for those of you who actively watch and comment on my videos,

61
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:45,720
I just want to say that I really appreciate that. It's the only tangible information I receive that

62
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:52,600
conveys the idea that I have a real audience. But what about the rest? The 80% of my subscriber base

63
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:58,200
who don't actually watch my videos? Are they even subscribers at that point? I'll admit it,

64
00:05:58,200 --> 00:06:03,160
I've acquired a lot of empty subscribers over the years, but that's okay. First of all because

65
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:09,480
YouTube is not my job. And also because my videos have been constantly changing every single year

66
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:14,280
since I started on this website. If you look at all the videos on my channel and find any two

67
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:18,360
that are just one year apart, they're going to be completely stylistically different. Hell,

68
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:23,560
my videos have become so different in this past year that my channel is almost unrecognizable

69
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:29,720
from even a year ago. Maybe, I may be. Remember that you are the H? Yeah, this is the type of

70
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:33,800
things that alienate subscribers. Because like I've said a million times already, a subscriber

71
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:38,600
is a real life human. And most real life humans are picky towards the content they enjoy. For

72
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:43,080
something as subjective as YouTube poop, it's pretty much impossible to keep a majority of

73
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:47,000
you guys satisfied. And now that I've started producing content that isn't really YouTube

74
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:52,440
poop at all, well, I guess you could say that my sub count has been on a downward spiral recently

75
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:57,240
and now I've lost thousands of subscribers completely. 39,000 actually. At least at the

76
00:06:57,240 --> 00:07:00,600
time of recording this video. That number is probably going to go up after I upload this,

77
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:05,560
but I'm not going to rag on these people. Believe it or not, I actually support these guys.

78
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:11,880
They get a thumbs up from me. What I don't like is when people stay subscribed to me and just do

79
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:17,880
nothing. There's a misconception on this website that a big subscriber count automatically equates

80
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:22,200
to popularity. And while that may sound quite intuitive, it's not exactly accurate.

81
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:27,320
What you really have to consider when judging a YouTube channel's popularity is to look at the

82
00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:32,600
empty subscribers. How many people are subscribed to this channel who aren't watching their videos?

83
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:37,160
Let's look at the YouTube channels Vsauce and WatchMojo, channels which have relatively

84
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:42,600
similar subscriber counts. Vsauce has about 11 million subscribers and their newest videos

85
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:55,560
are averaging about 5 million views each. WatchMojo on the other hand has about 2 million

86
00:07:55,560 --> 00:08:00,520
more subscribers than Vsauce. However, none of their most recent videos have even managed to

87
00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:05,160
break 1 million views and a majority of them have fewer than 200,000 views.

88
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:20,760
So is it really fair to say that WatchMojo is more popular than Vsauce when each Vsauce video

89
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:25,640
has 100 times as many views as the average WatchMojo upload? Now obviously these channels

90
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:30,360
have really different approaches to making content. Vsauce features highly polished,

91
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:34,840
well-researched videos which take months to produce. WatchMojo's business model is just

92
00:08:36,040 --> 00:08:41,640
PUMP OUT AS MANY FUCKING VIDEOS AS HUMANLY POSSIBLE! GO! GO FASTER GOD DAMN IT!

93
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:47,560
But we're all out of ideas. Are you? Yeah? ARE YOU? We've literally made a top 10 list

94
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:55,880
on every- ARE YOU? Oh, a new idea!

95
00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:03,880
Top 10 Canadian Actor Mustaches of the 80s!

96
00:09:17,560 --> 00:09:23,400
BOGER! IT'S NEVER BOGER! IT'S NEVER BOGER! IT'S NEVER BOGER! IT'S NEVER BOGER!

97
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:27,880
DOWN FOR A SMILING!

98
00:09:30,920 --> 00:09:41,880
FUCK YOU BOLTIMORE! IF YOU'RE TUMB ENOUGH TO BUY A NEW CAR THIS WEEKEND!

99
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:50,520
So because of this, WatchMojo has way more empty subscribers than Vsauce. I don't know about the

100
00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:55,640
rest of you guys, but I consider Vsauce to be a more popular YouTube channel than WatchMojo.

101
00:09:55,640 --> 00:09:59,880
Even though WatchMojo has more subscribers and gets more total views than Vsauce,

102
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:05,400
each new Vsauce upload is more relevant. It may not be intuitive, but this is the information

103
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:10,440
you must consider when evaluating the actual popularity of a YouTube channel. You can try

104
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:14,680
to think about it this way. Would you evaluate a person's health by looking at a person's weight?

105
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:19,960
Not looking at the person themselves, but just judging their health based on a numerical value

106
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:24,360
of their weight. Sure, you can make some inferences, but you couldn't reach a definitive conclusion

107
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:29,240
using only that information. That's sort of my same process when judging YouTube channels.

108
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:34,680
The raw sub count is a channel's weight, its mass, but you need to know what that mass is made of

109
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:40,280
before you can judge the health of a channel. A 280 pound man could be a super athletic strongman,

110
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:46,200
but they could also be a fat piece of shit. You can't tell without actually looking at their bodies.

111
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:50,360
Likewise, you can't judge a YouTube channel's true popularity without looking at the types of

112
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:55,240
subscribers which compose that channel. You have to ask yourself, are these subscribers actually

113
00:10:55,240 --> 00:10:59,400
invested in the YouTuber's content, or are they just there for a cheap thrill and a slap on the

114
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:06,280
dick? This is an epiphany I made about a year and a half ago. At this time, my channel was at its peak

115
00:11:06,280 --> 00:11:11,880
in raw popularity. My videos were hot commodities. Every video I uploaded would get over 100,000

116
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:17,000
views in a couple weeks, and at my peak I was gaining about 5,000 subs per month. Sounds pretty

117
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:21,080
sweet, right? How the hell could someone be dissatisfied with those numbers? Well, like I've

118
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:25,240
been saying, I look beyond the numbers. You guys may not believe this, but I try to read all of

119
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:29,960
my comments. If you've ever posted a comment on any of my videos, chances are I've read it. I

120
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:34,280
don't just read the comments on an individual basis though. I consider them collectively to

121
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:39,960
gauge the mood and tone of the audience. And around the time of my peak popularity,

122
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:44,040
something just felt off about my audience based on the comments I was receiving at the time.

123
00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:48,360
Believe it or not, there used to be a long time ago when my videos' comments weren't the complete

124
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:53,240
scourge of humanity. Way back then, the majority of the comments on my videos were actually quite

125
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:57,720
constructive and insightful observations. And while those types of comments have never truly

126
00:11:57,720 --> 00:12:02,600
disappeared, they've just been drowned out over the years by the obnoxious shouting contests that

127
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:06,760
try as desperately as possible to get your attention. The vast majority of my comments

128
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:12,680
just became, LOL, or some random quote from the video. Just really juvenile and impulsive shit.

129
00:12:12,680 --> 00:12:17,400
I began to get the heavy sensation that a large portion of my audience didn't actually respect me

130
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:22,840
and just wanted a cheap thrill. This dawned on me whenever I made the slightest change in my style,

131
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:28,040
and I would be continually met with larger and larger amounts of remedial criticism like,

132
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:33,960
THIS IS SHIT. Oh, side rant by the way, if you're gonna criticize a video on the internet,

133
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:39,480
please elaborate beyond saying, THIS IS SHIT. I've had this comment about a hundred times now,

134
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:44,040
and I know whoever posts these think they're being so edgy and rebellious and cool,

135
00:12:44,040 --> 00:12:49,560
but when an actual rational person sees your comment, they're basically seeing a giant stamp

136
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:55,080
on your forehead that says, my IQ is lower than my chromosome count. So next time you say something

137
00:12:55,080 --> 00:13:03,080
is shit, please explain why. Anyway, in about early 2015, my subscriber base was at its most

138
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:07,480
ravenous and least appreciative, and during this time I felt a tremendous pressure to keep my

139
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:12,200
videos at a certain standard, or else the fans would get upset. And it was during this time when

140
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:17,000
I began to stop enjoying making YouTube poops. It came to a point where I had to stop for a moment

141
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:22,280
and think about the state of my YouTube channel. I had to tell myself, look, you aren't having fun

142
00:13:22,280 --> 00:13:27,320
making these videos anymore, but you're gaining a shitload of subscribers, so you can either keep

143
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:32,360
making these long, polished videos and continue growing, or you can go back to having fun but

144
00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:37,080
piss off a lot of people. Ultimately, my decision came down to the quality of the subscribers

145
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:41,720
themselves. Did I really want to continue entertaining a bunch of prepubescent children

146
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:46,040
who don't actually respect me as a person, and instead view my YouTube channel as nothing more

147
00:13:46,040 --> 00:13:51,160
than a Skinner box of autistic video content? Did I really want to continue making videos for

148
00:13:51,160 --> 00:13:55,640
people who would turn on me at even the slightest level of dissatisfaction? Did I really want to

149
00:13:55,640 --> 00:14:00,840
have a fan base composed mostly of people who I would never actually talk to in real life?

150
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:09,080
My answer to all these questions was no, nope, and at that moment I hit the brakes on this channel

151
00:14:09,080 --> 00:14:13,240
and nothing was ever the same. Some would say that that was the beginning of the end,

152
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:17,720
that that was the point of me slipping over the precipice of the downward spiral. Others would

153
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:22,520
say that the chains were off, and that I had descended completely. Regardless, as soon as I

154
00:14:22,520 --> 00:14:27,400
made this decision, a vast majority of my subscribers became empty subscribers. I didn't

155
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:32,280
even have to upload a new video for this to be the case. It happened as soon as I made the decision.

156
00:14:32,280 --> 00:14:37,080
The majority of my subscribers at this time would not watch anything I made unless it was

157
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:41,400
Spongebob or Pixar YouTube Poop, and there's nothing I could have done about it. It was

158
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:46,680
inevitable. So my channel has a bunch of empty subscribers now. It's fat. It's fat! It needs to go on a

159
00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:52,120
diet. This is why I've been telling people to unsubscribe 125 times if they don't like my

160
00:14:52,120 --> 00:14:56,680
content. I want to get rid of the empty subscribers. I want my subscriber count to

161
00:14:56,680 --> 00:15:02,760
actually be reflective of the amount of people who watch my videos. But alas, the empty subscribers

162
00:15:02,760 --> 00:15:07,160
don't watch my new videos and they never quite get the memo. I can lure some of them out by

163
00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:11,640
sending traps like this, and I know a lot of you view this as a giant fuck you to the audience,

164
00:15:11,640 --> 00:15:16,040
but you gotta believe me in saying that all I wanted to do was get rid of the empty subscribers.

165
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:20,440
But even that barely worked, so I guess I'm just gonna have a shitload of subscribers who don't

166
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:24,920
watch my new videos but won't unsubscribe either, and they're just gonna stay there in subscriber

167
00:15:24,920 --> 00:15:27,720
purgatory... forever.

168
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:47,400
But hey, that's just a spiral! A downward spiral! Thanks for unsubscribing!

169
00:15:57,720 --> 00:16:08,680
The only thing that's for sure about implemen is this is shit.
