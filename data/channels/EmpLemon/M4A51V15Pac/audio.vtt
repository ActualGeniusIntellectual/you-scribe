00:00.000 --> 00:04.000
Gee, it sure is boring around here.

00:04.000 --> 00:08.200
I just wonder what my YouTube comments are up to.

00:08.200 --> 00:10.200
...

00:10.200 --> 00:12.200
...

00:12.200 --> 00:14.200
...

00:14.200 --> 00:16.200
...

00:16.200 --> 00:18.200
...

00:18.200 --> 00:20.200
...

00:20.200 --> 00:22.200
...

00:22.200 --> 00:27.760
stragJews

00:27.760 --> 00:30.520
A

00:30.520 --> 00:32.680

00:32.680 --> 00:34.040

00:37.620 --> 00:40.960
too strong with this want go back to

00:40.960 --> 00:44.180

00:44.180 --> 00:47.880
WTF this is absolute cringe

00:47.880 --> 00:51.460
what time we haha me quickly game absolute

00:51.460 --> 00:56.460
Cringe. I think behind the meme are cringe, but so are you.

00:56.460 --> 01:00.960
Personality picked straight from 4chan, except you aren't funny.

01:03.460 --> 01:09.660
Cringe as fuck. You're LITERALLY exactly as cringe as behind the meme.

01:09.660 --> 01:10.460
VIGORITIVELY

01:10.460 --> 01:13.460
Jesus, this video is cringe.

01:13.460 --> 01:14.760
JESUS

01:14.760 --> 01:19.960
Hearing people actually talk about memes out loud makes me cringe so bad,

01:19.960 --> 01:22.460
I couldn't make it to the end of this video.

01:22.460 --> 01:25.460
JESUS

01:25.460 --> 01:28.460
Dot, dot, dot...

01:28.460 --> 01:30.460
Cringe.

01:30.460 --> 01:34.460
The way this guy glorifies outsiders is so fuckin' cringe-worthy.

01:34.460 --> 01:36.960
It's Hannah Baker level of cringe.

01:38.460 --> 01:39.960
Why is this part of my recommended?

01:39.960 --> 01:41.960
Why did I watch the whole goddamn thing?

01:41.960 --> 01:44.960
This in itself is boring and cringe.

01:44.960 --> 01:49.460
You are being pretentious about a dude trying to explain the joke

01:49.460 --> 01:53.940
The older ways of acting are out of your mind, how are your description of an outsider followed?

01:53.940 --> 01:55.940
Drama only worsens the situation.

01:55.940 --> 01:59.780
I found ant farm videos more entertaining than I HATE FUCKING ANTS!

01:59.780 --> 02:01.780
Hey man, that's not cool.

02:01.780 --> 02:04.780
This is fucking cringe.

02:04.780 --> 02:09.060
The fact that anyone actually takes meme culture seriously is the true cringe.

02:09.060 --> 02:09.940
Cringe.

02:09.940 --> 02:15.860
I know the word cringe is inherently cringey, but this video and they way you act is cringey.

02:15.860 --> 02:19.380
The fact that there needs to be an argument about memes is sad.

02:19.460 --> 02:21.460
Calm the fuck down about normies.

02:21.460 --> 02:23.460
It's just cringe.

02:23.460 --> 02:25.460
I'M A COLD BASTARD!

02:25.460 --> 02:27.460
This is just...

02:28.660 --> 02:30.020
Cringe.

02:30.020 --> 02:32.820
Wow, this is fucking cringe.

02:32.820 --> 02:34.100
I love anime!

02:34.100 --> 02:36.660
To be honest, I hate using the word normie.

02:36.660 --> 02:38.900
It sounds cringey.

02:38.900 --> 02:41.780
My lord, why is this person such an elitist?

02:41.780 --> 02:44.180
Nothing is black and white, people are fluid.

02:44.180 --> 02:48.260
Most people fall somewhere in between normie, cringe, and outsider.

02:48.260 --> 02:51.540
Just fucking let people enjoy the content they want to enjoy.

02:51.540 --> 02:56.660
It's a wonderful thing more people are being exposed to a greater variety of content.

02:56.660 --> 02:59.380
A GREATER VARIETY OF CONTENT!

02:59.380 --> 03:00.100
Jeez.

03:00.100 --> 03:04.900
The problem behind this video is there's why too much ear rape, cringe moments,

03:04.900 --> 03:07.860
and things that really make behind the meme angry.

03:07.860 --> 03:08.340
What?

03:08.340 --> 03:13.540
You take memes way too seriously and it comes off as sad and cringe.

03:13.540 --> 03:15.060
BUT I MEAN IT!

03:15.140 --> 03:16.020
Cringe.

03:16.020 --> 03:16.980
My god.

03:16.980 --> 03:18.740
The cringe in this video.

03:19.300 --> 03:22.740
Get a fucking life instead of screeching like an

03:22.740 --> 03:24.660
AUTIST

03:24.660 --> 03:28.100
when people don't respect retarded jokes on the internet.

03:30.260 --> 03:31.940
You should just stick to YouTube poops.

03:31.940 --> 03:34.340
Your attempt at a roast was cringey.

03:34.340 --> 03:35.620
Oh, you gods!

03:35.620 --> 03:36.900
My roast is ruined!

03:36.900 --> 03:38.820
This is so cringey, son.

03:38.820 --> 03:41.540
These folk are katanas from Usha.

03:41.540 --> 03:44.740
Their subsidiary of Musashi, focusing on budget katanas,

03:44.740 --> 03:48.100
ranging from about $40 to $100 in price.

03:48.100 --> 03:50.660
This is so goddamn cringey.

03:50.660 --> 03:52.260
Cringey shit!

03:52.260 --> 03:56.580
This would be cool unless Cringey used a different word than normie.

04:00.020 --> 04:02.660
The fucking WWE editing is cringey.

04:02.660 --> 04:15.860
This is, hands down, the cringiest thing I've ever watched.

04:15.860 --> 04:18.980
The cringiest thing I've ever watched.

04:18.980 --> 04:22.020
Jesus fuck, this was cringey.

04:22.020 --> 04:24.340
JESUS FUCK

04:24.340 --> 04:30.180
Six minutes in and I have second hand AUTISM.

04:30.180 --> 04:34.420
Behind the meme is boring, but this was really cringey.

04:35.220 --> 04:36.820
You're cringey.

04:36.820 --> 04:40.180
This is such a cringey video from a cringey channel

04:40.180 --> 04:43.540
talking about another equally but different cringey channel.

04:43.540 --> 04:46.180
This is so fucking cringey.

04:46.180 --> 04:48.820
This video is pretty cringey to be honest.

04:48.820 --> 04:49.620
OH MY GOD

04:49.620 --> 04:51.620
This video is so cringey.

04:51.620 --> 04:54.900
People who say cringey need to fucking stop.

04:54.900 --> 04:56.740
Yes! Thank you!

04:56.740 --> 04:58.420
Fucking god it's cringey.

04:58.420 --> 05:01.060
Stop saying with an E it's fucking cringey.

05:09.220 --> 05:11.940
And now, ladies and gentlemen.

05:11.940 --> 05:14.740
The moment you've all been waiting for.

05:14.740 --> 05:17.140
We've saved the best for last.

05:18.740 --> 05:23.940
Let's get ready to rumble!

05:23.940 --> 05:26.100
Poor behind the meme.

05:26.100 --> 05:27.540
He isn't that bad.

05:27.540 --> 05:28.820
Sentence shifting.

05:28.820 --> 05:30.980
I really don't get.

05:30.980 --> 05:33.780
I don't understand.

05:33.780 --> 05:35.060
How you hate him you know.

05:35.060 --> 05:37.060
He's actually pretty good.

05:37.060 --> 05:39.300
Behind the meme is about memes and their history.

05:39.300 --> 05:41.700
Not being cringey or something.

05:41.700 --> 05:42.740
There it is!

05:42.740 --> 05:44.500
Mama memes.

05:44.500 --> 05:45.300
Not cringey.

05:45.300 --> 05:47.380
Behind the meme does his job really well.

05:47.380 --> 05:50.180
The know your meme webpage dedicated to the topic.

05:50.180 --> 05:52.900
Helping people who have no idea.

05:52.900 --> 05:54.980
I don't know what that means.

05:54.980 --> 05:56.820
About some of the memes and their meanings.

05:57.540 --> 05:59.620
But you.

05:59.620 --> 06:02.020
You have no idea what your video is about.

06:02.020 --> 06:03.620
I know what I see.

06:03.620 --> 06:07.380
All I heard was distorted voices and bright obnoxious colors.

06:07.380 --> 06:09.140
I got dizzy and after a while.

06:09.140 --> 06:11.620
I swear that my ears started to bleed.

06:11.620 --> 06:14.420
Are you jealous of behind the meme?

06:14.420 --> 06:18.340
Because you are hating him for literally no reason.

06:18.340 --> 06:22.980
I watched this vid twice and I still don't get why you hate him.

06:22.980 --> 06:25.220
I will say this one more time.

06:25.220 --> 06:30.020
Behind the meme is about fucking teaching you about memes.

06:30.020 --> 06:37.140
And he is just trying to help people who have no idea what half the memes are.

06:37.140 --> 06:39.620
You are a fucking dick.

06:39.620 --> 06:40.500
You know.

06:40.500 --> 06:42.340
You don't know.

06:42.340 --> 06:48.020
People will respect you if you actually did something properly.

06:48.020 --> 06:54.420
Like actually having a reason to hate him.

06:54.420 --> 06:54.980
Oh yeah.

06:55.780 --> 06:56.900
No one does.

07:02.340 --> 07:04.740
We paid nine dollars for this?

07:04.740 --> 07:11.380
I paid FIFTEEN.
