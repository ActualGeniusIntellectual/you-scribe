1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Gee, it sure is boring around here.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,200
I just wonder what my YouTube comments are up to.

3
00:00:08,200 --> 00:00:10,200
...

4
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:12,200
...

5
00:00:12,200 --> 00:00:14,200
...

6
00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:16,200
...

7
00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:18,200
...

8
00:00:18,200 --> 00:00:20,200
...

9
00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:22,200
...

10
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:27,760
stragJews

11
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:30,520
A

12
00:00:30,520 --> 00:00:32,680

13
00:00:32,680 --> 00:00:34,040

00:00:47,880 --> 00:00:51,460
what time we haha me quickly game absolute

19
00:00:51,460 --> 00:00:56,460
Cringe. I think behind the meme are cringe, but so are you.

20
00:00:56,460 --> 00:01:00,960
Personality picked straight from 4chan, except you aren't funny.

21
00:01:03,460 --> 00:01:09,660
Cringe as fuck. You're LITERALLY exactly as cringe as behind the meme.

22
00:01:09,660 --> 00:01:10,460
VIGORITIVELY

23
00:01:10,460 --> 00:01:13,460
Jesus, this video is cringe.

24
00:01:13,460 --> 00:01:14,760
JESUS

25
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:19,960
Hearing people actually talk about memes out loud makes me cringe so bad,

26
00:01:19,960 --> 00:01:22,460
I couldn't make it to the end of this video.

27
00:01:22,460 --> 00:01:25,460
JESUS

28
00:01:25,460 --> 00:01:28,460
Dot, dot, dot...

29
00:01:28,460 --> 00:01:30,460
Cringe.

30
00:01:30,460 --> 00:01:34,460
The way this guy glorifies outsiders is so fuckin' cringe-worthy.

31
00:01:34,460 --> 00:01:36,960
It's Hannah Baker level of cringe.

32
00:01:38,460 --> 00:01:39,960
Why is this part of my recommended?

33
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:41,960
Why did I watch the whole goddamn thing?

34
00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:44,960
This in itself is boring and cringe.

35
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:49,460
You are being pretentious about a dude trying to explain the joke

36
00:01:49,460 --> 00:01:53,940
The older ways of acting are out of your mind, how are your description of an outsider followed?

37
00:01:53,940 --> 00:01:55,940
Drama only worsens the situation.

38
00:01:55,940 --> 00:01:59,780
I found ant farm videos more entertaining than I HATE FUCKING ANTS!

39
00:01:59,780 --> 00:02:01,780
Hey man, that's not cool.

40
00:02:01,780 --> 00:02:04,780
This is fucking cringe.

41
00:02:04,780 --> 00:02:09,060
The fact that anyone actually takes meme culture seriously is the true cringe.

42
00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:09,940
Cringe.

43
00:02:09,940 --> 00:02:15,860
I know the word cringe is inherently cringey, but this video and they way you act is cringey.

44
00:02:15,860 --> 00:02:19,380
The fact that there needs to be an argument about memes is sad.

45
00:02:19,460 --> 00:02:21,460
Calm the fuck down about normies.

46
00:02:21,460 --> 00:02:23,460
It's just cringe.

47
00:02:23,460 --> 00:02:25,460
I'M A COLD BASTARD!

48
00:02:25,460 --> 00:02:27,460
This is just...

49
00:02:28,660 --> 00:02:30,020
Cringe.

50
00:02:30,020 --> 00:02:32,820
Wow, this is fucking cringe.

51
00:02:32,820 --> 00:02:34,100
I love anime!

52
00:02:34,100 --> 00:02:36,660
To be honest, I hate using the word normie.

53
00:02:36,660 --> 00:02:38,900
It sounds cringey.

54
00:02:38,900 --> 00:02:41,780
My lord, why is this person such an elitist?

55
00:02:41,780 --> 00:02:44,180
Nothing is black and white, people are fluid.

56
00:02:44,180 --> 00:02:48,260
Most people fall somewhere in between normie, cringe, and outsider.

57
00:02:48,260 --> 00:02:51,540
Just fucking let people enjoy the content they want to enjoy.

58
00:02:51,540 --> 00:02:56,660
It's a wonderful thing more people are being exposed to a greater variety of content.

59
00:02:56,660 --> 00:02:59,380
A GREATER VARIETY OF CONTENT!

60
00:02:59,380 --> 00:03:00,100
Jeez.

61
00:03:00,100 --> 00:03:04,900
The problem behind this video is there's why too much ear rape, cringe moments,

62
00:03:04,900 --> 00:03:07,860
and things that really make behind the meme angry.

63
00:03:07,860 --> 00:03:08,340
What?

64
00:03:08,340 --> 00:03:13,540
You take memes way too seriously and it comes off as sad and cringe.

65
00:03:13,540 --> 00:03:15,060
BUT I MEAN IT!

66
00:03:15,140 --> 00:03:16,020
Cringe.

67
00:03:16,020 --> 00:03:16,980
My god.

68
00:03:16,980 --> 00:03:18,740
The cringe in this video.

69
00:03:19,300 --> 00:03:22,740
Get a fucking life instead of screeching like an

70
00:03:22,740 --> 00:03:24,660
AUTIST

71
00:03:24,660 --> 00:03:28,100
when people don't respect retarded jokes on the internet.

72
00:03:30,260 --> 00:03:31,940
You should just stick to YouTube poops.

73
00:03:31,940 --> 00:03:34,340
Your attempt at a roast was cringey.

74
00:03:34,340 --> 00:03:35,620
Oh, you gods!

75
00:03:35,620 --> 00:03:36,900
My roast is ruined!

76
00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:38,820
This is so cringey, son.

77
00:03:38,820 --> 00:03:41,540
These folk are katanas from Usha.

78
00:03:41,540 --> 00:03:44,740
Their subsidiary of Musashi, focusing on budget katanas,

79
00:03:44,740 --> 00:03:48,100
ranging from about $40 to $100 in price.

80
00:03:48,100 --> 00:03:50,660
This is so goddamn cringey.

81
00:03:50,660 --> 00:03:52,260
Cringey shit!

82
00:03:52,260 --> 00:03:56,580
This would be cool unless Cringey used a different word than normie.

83
00:04:00,020 --> 00:04:02,660
The fucking WWE editing is cringey.

84
00:04:02,660 --> 00:04:15,860
This is, hands down, the cringiest thing I've ever watched.

85
00:04:15,860 --> 00:04:18,980
The cringiest thing I've ever watched.

86
00:04:18,980 --> 00:04:22,020
Jesus fuck, this was cringey.

87
00:04:22,020 --> 00:04:24,340
JESUS FUCK

88
00:04:24,340 --> 00:04:30,180
Six minutes in and I have second hand AUTISM.

89
00:04:30,180 --> 00:04:34,420
Behind the meme is boring, but this was really cringey.

90
00:04:35,220 --> 00:04:36,820
You're cringey.

91
00:04:36,820 --> 00:04:40,180
This is such a cringey video from a cringey channel

92
00:04:40,180 --> 00:04:43,540
talking about another equally but different cringey channel.

93
00:04:43,540 --> 00:04:46,180
This is so fucking cringey.

94
00:04:46,180 --> 00:04:48,820
This video is pretty cringey to be honest.

95
00:04:48,820 --> 00:04:49,620
OH MY GOD

96
00:04:49,620 --> 00:04:51,620
This video is so cringey.

97
00:04:51,620 --> 00:04:54,900
People who say cringey need to fucking stop.

98
00:04:54,900 --> 00:04:56,740
Yes! Thank you!

99
00:04:56,740 --> 00:04:58,420
Fucking god it's cringey.

100
00:04:58,420 --> 00:05:01,060
Stop saying with an E it's fucking cringey.

101
00:05:09,220 --> 00:05:11,940
And now, ladies and gentlemen.

102
00:05:11,940 --> 00:05:14,740
The moment you've all been waiting for.

103
00:05:14,740 --> 00:05:17,140
We've saved the best for last.

104
00:05:18,740 --> 00:05:23,940
Let's get ready to rumble!

105
00:05:23,940 --> 00:05:26,100
Poor behind the meme.

106
00:05:26,100 --> 00:05:27,540
He isn't that bad.

107
00:05:27,540 --> 00:05:28,820
Sentence shifting.

108
00:05:28,820 --> 00:05:30,980
I really don't get.

109
00:05:30,980 --> 00:05:33,780
I don't understand.

110
00:05:33,780 --> 00:05:35,060
How you hate him you know.

111
00:05:35,060 --> 00:05:37,060
He's actually pretty good.

112
00:05:37,060 --> 00:05:39,300
Behind the meme is about memes and their history.

113
00:05:39,300 --> 00:05:41,700
Not being cringey or something.

114
00:05:41,700 --> 00:05:42,740
There it is!

115
00:05:42,740 --> 00:05:44,500
Mama memes.

116
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:45,300
Not cringey.

117
00:05:45,300 --> 00:05:47,380
Behind the meme does his job really well.

118
00:05:47,380 --> 00:05:50,180
The know your meme webpage dedicated to the topic.

119
00:05:50,180 --> 00:05:52,900
Helping people who have no idea.

120
00:05:52,900 --> 00:05:54,980
I don't know what that means.

121
00:05:54,980 --> 00:05:56,820
About some of the memes and their meanings.

122
00:05:57,540 --> 00:05:59,620
But you.

123
00:05:59,620 --> 00:06:02,020
You have no idea what your video is about.

124
00:06:02,020 --> 00:06:03,620
I know what I see.

125
00:06:03,620 --> 00:06:07,380
All I heard was distorted voices and bright obnoxious colors.

126
00:06:07,380 --> 00:06:09,140
I got dizzy and after a while.

127
00:06:09,140 --> 00:06:11,620
I swear that my ears started to bleed.

128
00:06:11,620 --> 00:06:14,420
Are you jealous of behind the meme?

129
00:06:14,420 --> 00:06:18,340
Because you are hating him for literally no reason.

130
00:06:18,340 --> 00:06:22,980
I watched this vid twice and I still don't get why you hate him.

131
00:06:22,980 --> 00:06:25,220
I will say this one more time.

132
00:06:25,220 --> 00:06:30,020
Behind the meme is about fucking teaching you about memes.

133
00:06:30,020 --> 00:06:37,140
And he is just trying to help people who have no idea what half the memes are.

134
00:06:37,140 --> 00:06:39,620
You are a fucking dick.

135
00:06:39,620 --> 00:06:40,500
You know.

136
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:42,340
You don't know.

137
00:06:42,340 --> 00:06:48,020
People will respect you if you actually did something properly.

138
00:06:48,020 --> 00:06:54,420
Like actually having a reason to hate him.

139
00:06:54,420 --> 00:06:54,980
Oh yeah.

140
00:06:55,780 --> 00:06:56,900
No one does.

141
00:07:02,340 --> 00:07:04,740
We paid nine dollars for this?

142
00:07:04,740 --> 00:07:11,380
I paid FIFTEEN.
