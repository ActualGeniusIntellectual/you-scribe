51460	56460	Cringe. I think behind the meme are cringe, but so are you.
56460	60960	Personality picked straight from 4chan, except you aren't funny.
63460	69660	Cringe as fuck. You're LITERALLY exactly as cringe as behind the meme.
69660	70460	VIGORITIVELY
70460	73460	Jesus, this video is cringe.
73460	74760	JESUS
74760	79960	Hearing people actually talk about memes out loud makes me cringe so bad,
79960	82460	I couldn't make it to the end of this video.
82460	85460	JESUS
85460	88460	Dot, dot, dot...
88460	90460	Cringe.
90460	94460	The way this guy glorifies outsiders is so fuckin' cringe-worthy.
94460	96960	It's Hannah Baker level of cringe.
98460	99960	Why is this part of my recommended?
99960	101960	Why did I watch the whole goddamn thing?
101960	104960	This in itself is boring and cringe.
104960	109460	You are being pretentious about a dude trying to explain the joke
109460	113940	The older ways of acting are out of your mind, how are your description of an outsider followed?
113940	115940	Drama only worsens the situation.
115940	119780	I found ant farm videos more entertaining than I HATE FUCKING ANTS!
119780	121780	Hey man, that's not cool.
121780	124780	This is fucking cringe.
124780	129060	The fact that anyone actually takes meme culture seriously is the true cringe.
129060	129940	Cringe.
129940	135860	I know the word cringe is inherently cringey, but this video and they way you act is cringey.
135860	139380	The fact that there needs to be an argument about memes is sad.
139460	141460	Calm the fuck down about normies.
141460	143460	It's just cringe.
143460	145460	I'M A COLD BASTARD!
145460	147460	This is just...
148660	150020	Cringe.
150020	152820	Wow, this is fucking cringe.
152820	154100	I love anime!
154100	156660	To be honest, I hate using the word normie.
156660	158900	It sounds cringey.
158900	161780	My lord, why is this person such an elitist?
161780	164180	Nothing is black and white, people are fluid.
164180	168260	Most people fall somewhere in between normie, cringe, and outsider.
168260	171540	Just fucking let people enjoy the content they want to enjoy.
171540	176660	It's a wonderful thing more people are being exposed to a greater variety of content.
176660	179380	A GREATER VARIETY OF CONTENT!
179380	180100	Jeez.
180100	184900	The problem behind this video is there's why too much ear rape, cringe moments,
184900	187860	and things that really make behind the meme angry.
187860	188340	What?
188340	193540	You take memes way too seriously and it comes off as sad and cringe.
193540	195060	BUT I MEAN IT!
195140	196020	Cringe.
196020	196980	My god.
196980	198740	The cringe in this video.
199300	202740	Get a fucking life instead of screeching like an
202740	204660	AUTIST
204660	208100	when people don't respect retarded jokes on the internet.
210260	211940	You should just stick to YouTube poops.
211940	214340	Your attempt at a roast was cringey.
214340	215620	Oh, you gods!
215620	216900	My roast is ruined!
216900	218820	This is so cringey, son.
218820	221540	These folk are katanas from Usha.
221540	224740	Their subsidiary of Musashi, focusing on budget katanas,
224740	228100	ranging from about $40 to $100 in price.
228100	230660	This is so goddamn cringey.
230660	232260	Cringey shit!
232260	236580	This would be cool unless Cringey used a different word than normie.
240020	242660	The fucking WWE editing is cringey.
242660	255860	This is, hands down, the cringiest thing I've ever watched.
255860	258980	The cringiest thing I've ever watched.
258980	262020	Jesus fuck, this was cringey.
262020	264340	JESUS FUCK
264340	270180	Six minutes in and I have second hand AUTISM.
270180	274420	Behind the meme is boring, but this was really cringey.
275220	276820	You're cringey.
276820	280180	This is such a cringey video from a cringey channel
280180	283540	talking about another equally but different cringey channel.
283540	286180	This is so fucking cringey.
286180	288820	This video is pretty cringey to be honest.
288820	289620	OH MY GOD
289620	291620	This video is so cringey.
291620	294900	People who say cringey need to fucking stop.
294900	296740	Yes! Thank you!
296740	298420	Fucking god it's cringey.
298420	301060	Stop saying with an E it's fucking cringey.
309220	311940	And now, ladies and gentlemen.
311940	314740	The moment you've all been waiting for.
314740	317140	We've saved the best for last.
318740	323940	Let's get ready to rumble!
323940	326100	Poor behind the meme.
326100	327540	He isn't that bad.
327540	328820	Sentence shifting.
328820	330980	I really don't get.
330980	333780	I don't understand.
333780	335060	How you hate him you know.
335060	337060	He's actually pretty good.
337060	339300	Behind the meme is about memes and their history.
339300	341700	Not being cringey or something.
341700	342740	There it is!
342740	344500	Mama memes.
344500	345300	Not cringey.
345300	347380	Behind the meme does his job really well.
347380	350180	The know your meme webpage dedicated to the topic.
350180	352900	Helping people who have no idea.
352900	354980	I don't know what that means.
354980	356820	About some of the memes and their meanings.
357540	359620	But you.
359620	362020	You have no idea what your video is about.
362020	363620	I know what I see.
363620	367380	All I heard was distorted voices and bright obnoxious colors.
367380	369140	I got dizzy and after a while.
369140	371620	I swear that my ears started to bleed.
371620	374420	Are you jealous of behind the meme?
374420	378340	Because you are hating him for literally no reason.
378340	382980	I watched this vid twice and I still don't get why you hate him.
382980	385220	I will say this one more time.
385220	390020	Behind the meme is about fucking teaching you about memes.
390020	397140	And he is just trying to help people who have no idea what half the memes are.
397140	399620	You are a fucking dick.
399620	400500	You know.
400500	402340	You don't know.
402340	408020	People will respect you if you actually did something properly.
408020	414420	Like actually having a reason to hate him.
414420	414980	Oh yeah.
415780	416900	No one does.
422340	424740	We paid nine dollars for this?
424740	431380	I paid FIFTEEN.
