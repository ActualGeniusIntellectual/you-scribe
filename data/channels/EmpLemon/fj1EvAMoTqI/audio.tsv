0	5000	So, I like to look at the YouTube trending tab once every couple of days or so.
5000	13000	It's a good place to find some interesting content that you couldn't find otherwise through the recommended videos or other means.
13000	17000	But the trending tab is without a doubt a mixed bag of content.
17000	26500	There's usually a few videos that I enjoy, but most of the videos are really run-of-the-mill mainstream stuff like music videos, talk shows, celebrities, Trump.
26500	29000	Not really stuff that I would want to watch.
29000	31000	But generally harmless content.
31000	35000	But sometimes, I come across that video.
35000	42000	A video so insanely idiotic that you can't comprehend what could lead a group of human beings to think this way.
42000	44000	Videos like this.
44500	47000	AHHHH!
51500	53000	Oh.
53000	55000	Ah.
55000	67000	Oh, I'm having a little bit of trouble recording this audio on account of the crushing weight of my privilege on my shoulders.
67000	70740	Oh, wait. There's actually nothing there.
71400	73760	It feels like I'm baring. Nothing at all.
74200	76500	Nothing at all! Nothing at all!
76800	79440	The fuck does check your privilege even mean?
79680	84440	I understand that it's supposedly based on the idea of people showing reflexivity
84440	88220	for how people's situations can determine their social standing,
88420	90520	which is admittedly a fair concept.
90760	93720	I don't know, Buzzfeed, what exactly is my privilege?
93880	101480	It has a lot to do with how your identity benefits from a system that has been in place for a very, very long time.
101480	103480	Yeah. Winning the birth lottery.
105220	105720	Loser.
108120	111520	You know, if you actually think about it, this is a pretty shitty analogy.
111520	116440	Saying that a human being born into a prosperous life is the equivalent of winning a lottery
116440	120640	implies that every human has a random chance of having rich parents or whatever.
120940	124140	No, this is 100% biologically false.
124140	131840	Based on the fact that my specific genes are derived from a specific gene combination from my specific parents,
131840	137840	it is physically impossible for me to exist if I was born to any other combination of parents in the world.
138340	143840	Why are you implying that I had a chance not to be born into a middle-class American household?
144040	151040	By that logic, should I also chuck my privilege of not being born as a cow, or a bumblebee, or a fucking tree?
151040	152640	This is Koo-Allah!
152640	153840	Oh my god!
153840	157240	The spirit tree! For generations, it has guided-
159640	163840	You have to get us the fuck out of here! These people are backwards savages!
164140	171840	Anyway, the video then presents a spread of people so diverse that it would make PBS television seem bigoted by comparison.
171840	184840	Why does everything have to be about race and gender again? Think about this realistically.
184840	190640	Does a person's race or gender really matter when considering their quote-unquote privilege?
190640	195640	So, you're saying I should feel sorry for a guy like Michael Jordan who has millions upon millions of dollars
195640	200640	and is one of the most well-regarded and widely known, most successful NBA basketball players of all time?
202640	206640	You're saying I should feel sorry for him because he's black?
206640	213640	So, is Morgan Freeman less privileged than Jack Nicholson because Morgan Freeman is black?
213640	215640	What the fuck is this, Yu-Gi-Oh?
219640	224640	You've activated my race card! Since you're a Caucasian type, you gain plus 50 privilege points!
224640	227640	Donald Trump got like a thousand percent on this.
232640	237640	Ironically, a channel which tries to show how diverse and progressive it is
237640	244640	reveals a pretty implicitly racist message by insinuating that any non-white person needs to be pitied.
244640	250640	So anyway, the fucking United Nations takes Buzzfeed's racial shaming quiz.
250640	254640	And I'm looking at this totally scientific and non-clickbait quiz
254640	258640	and I noticed that most of these options are just indicating different plausible methods
259440	261440	through which a person could have been oppressed.
261440	265440	But I can't help but wonder to myself, what the fuck are some of these options?
265440	269440	I have never worked as a waiter, barista, bartender, or salesperson.
269440	273440	So, you're oppressed if you work as a waiter.
273440	275440	I must know your name.
276440	277440	My name?
281440	284440	Who doesn't know what your name is?
286440	287440	Wake me up!
288240	289240	Wake me up!
292240	295240	I have never had to worry about making rent.
295240	300240	So you're privileged if you make fiscally sensible decisions based on your economic outlook
300240	303240	and don't buy things that you can't afford?
303240	305240	I went to summer camp.
305240	308240	Could this be any more irrelevant? What's next?
308240	311240	I played with Legos as a kid? I had a Wii U?
311240	314240	Oh god, now those are the people you should fucking pity.
318240	322240	And of course there's a bunch of options if you've ever been called a derogatory term.
322240	326240	And I agree that these can be really offensive in the wrong context,
326240	330240	but what the fuck does this have to do with someone's privilege?
330240	333240	So, an ignorant dude called you a name you don't like.
333240	338240	Does it really impact you that much to say that you're now less privileged than someone else because of it?
338240	340240	Get away from the door!
343240	347240	There's also a couple of options based on if you've ever felt something.
348040	353040	As if someone's own subjective feelings are relevant to their social status.
353040	356040	Please allow The Rock to explain this to you people.
356040	359040	It doesn't matter how it makes you feel!
364040	367040	And of course there's always the totally rational options of
367040	370040	I am white and I am a man.
370040	373040	Because yeah, fuck white people and fuck men too.
373040	374040	You guys got it too easy.
374040	377040	Maybe you weren't so inflated by your massive privilege.
377040	381040	Your success has nothing to do with your economic standing or anything.
381040	384040	The only thing that matters is good ol' race and gender.
384040	385040	You wanna know who's a white male?
385040	386040	My father!
386040	392040	So, according to Buzzfeed he's been rich and educated his whole life because of his white male privilege, right?
392040	393040	Wrong!
393040	398040	Believe it or not, my dad was on welfare as a kid and he never got a college education.
398040	400040	But rather than wallowing in his own self-pity,
400040	404040	he made something of his life so that I wouldn't have to grow up in those same shitty conditions.
404040	408040	My mom grew up in communist China under fucking Mao.
411040	413040	And she came to America in search of a better life.
413040	419040	And I'm supposed to feel ashamed that my parents improved their lives to the point where I had a good childhood?
419040	420040	Fuck you!
423040	425040	You should never, ever, never,
431040	434040	be made to feel ashamed of who you are.
434040	437040	Number one because your identity is the only thing you really own.
437040	441040	And number two because it's based on factors completely out of your control.
441040	443040	And I get it, okay?
443040	447040	It's important to understand that there are people who are less fortunate than you in this world.
447040	448040	But you know what?
448040	449040	They're not you.
449040	453040	You're the only one who can take control of your life and become the best person you can possibly be.
453040	458040	And no amount of dumb, make-believe privilege is gonna change that.
458040	463040	And it's stupid click-baity BuzzFeed videos like this that get a zillion views on Facebook
463040	465040	and make tons of naive people say,
465040	467040	Oh, why bother improving myself?
467040	470040	I'm clearly so underprivileged.
470040	477040	Man, I hate how heterosexual white males are all super successful because they have so much privilege.
479040	480040	I feel a little sad.
480040	483040	It doesn't matter how it makes you feel!
483040	486040	Ahh! Ahh!
486040	488040	Wah! Wah!
488040	490040	You like that? Huh? You like that?
490040	491040	Wah!
494040	495040	Don't watch BuzzFeed, kids.
495040	498040	Ten million fucking subscribers, my ass.
498040	499040	That's a stupid decision.
499040	502040	That can only be made by a stupid idiot.
502040	504040	Fucking hate idiots, man.
504040	506040	What exactly is my privilege?
506040	511040	I think the word has just become a symbolic issue for powerful groups that feel like they're doing the right thing.
511040	512040	Well, that's retarded.
