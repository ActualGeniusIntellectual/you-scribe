00:00.000 --> 00:05.000
So, I like to look at the YouTube trending tab once every couple of days or so.

00:05.000 --> 00:13.000
It's a good place to find some interesting content that you couldn't find otherwise through the recommended videos or other means.

00:13.000 --> 00:17.000
But the trending tab is without a doubt a mixed bag of content.

00:17.000 --> 00:26.500
There's usually a few videos that I enjoy, but most of the videos are really run-of-the-mill mainstream stuff like music videos, talk shows, celebrities, Trump.

00:26.500 --> 00:29.000
Not really stuff that I would want to watch.

00:29.000 --> 00:31.000
But generally harmless content.

00:31.000 --> 00:35.000
But sometimes, I come across that video.

00:35.000 --> 00:42.000
A video so insanely idiotic that you can't comprehend what could lead a group of human beings to think this way.

00:42.000 --> 00:44.000
Videos like this.

00:44.500 --> 00:47.000
AHHHH!

00:51.500 --> 00:53.000
Oh.

00:53.000 --> 00:55.000
Ah.

00:55.000 --> 01:07.000
Oh, I'm having a little bit of trouble recording this audio on account of the crushing weight of my privilege on my shoulders.

01:07.000 --> 01:10.740
Oh, wait. There's actually nothing there.

01:11.400 --> 01:13.760
It feels like I'm baring. Nothing at all.

01:14.200 --> 01:16.500
Nothing at all! Nothing at all!

01:16.800 --> 01:19.440
The fuck does check your privilege even mean?

01:19.680 --> 01:24.440
I understand that it's supposedly based on the idea of people showing reflexivity

01:24.440 --> 01:28.220
for how people's situations can determine their social standing,

01:28.420 --> 01:30.520
which is admittedly a fair concept.

01:30.760 --> 01:33.720
I don't know, Buzzfeed, what exactly is my privilege?

01:33.880 --> 01:41.480
It has a lot to do with how your identity benefits from a system that has been in place for a very, very long time.

01:41.480 --> 01:43.480
Yeah. Winning the birth lottery.

01:45.220 --> 01:45.720
Loser.

01:48.120 --> 01:51.520
You know, if you actually think about it, this is a pretty shitty analogy.

01:51.520 --> 01:56.440
Saying that a human being born into a prosperous life is the equivalent of winning a lottery

01:56.440 --> 02:00.640
implies that every human has a random chance of having rich parents or whatever.

02:00.940 --> 02:04.140
No, this is 100% biologically false.

02:04.140 --> 02:11.840
Based on the fact that my specific genes are derived from a specific gene combination from my specific parents,

02:11.840 --> 02:17.840
it is physically impossible for me to exist if I was born to any other combination of parents in the world.

02:18.340 --> 02:23.840
Why are you implying that I had a chance not to be born into a middle-class American household?

02:24.040 --> 02:31.040
By that logic, should I also chuck my privilege of not being born as a cow, or a bumblebee, or a fucking tree?

02:31.040 --> 02:32.640
This is Koo-Allah!

02:32.640 --> 02:33.840
Oh my god!

02:33.840 --> 02:37.240
The spirit tree! For generations, it has guided-

02:39.640 --> 02:43.840
You have to get us the fuck out of here! These people are backwards savages!

02:44.140 --> 02:51.840
Anyway, the video then presents a spread of people so diverse that it would make PBS television seem bigoted by comparison.

02:51.840 --> 03:04.840
Why does everything have to be about race and gender again? Think about this realistically.

03:04.840 --> 03:10.640
Does a person's race or gender really matter when considering their quote-unquote privilege?

03:10.640 --> 03:15.640
So, you're saying I should feel sorry for a guy like Michael Jordan who has millions upon millions of dollars

03:15.640 --> 03:20.640
and is one of the most well-regarded and widely known, most successful NBA basketball players of all time?

03:22.640 --> 03:26.640
You're saying I should feel sorry for him because he's black?

03:26.640 --> 03:33.640
So, is Morgan Freeman less privileged than Jack Nicholson because Morgan Freeman is black?

03:33.640 --> 03:35.640
What the fuck is this, Yu-Gi-Oh?

03:39.640 --> 03:44.640
You've activated my race card! Since you're a Caucasian type, you gain plus 50 privilege points!

03:44.640 --> 03:47.640
Donald Trump got like a thousand percent on this.

03:52.640 --> 03:57.640
Ironically, a channel which tries to show how diverse and progressive it is

03:57.640 --> 04:04.640
reveals a pretty implicitly racist message by insinuating that any non-white person needs to be pitied.

04:04.640 --> 04:10.640
So anyway, the fucking United Nations takes Buzzfeed's racial shaming quiz.

04:10.640 --> 04:14.640
And I'm looking at this totally scientific and non-clickbait quiz

04:14.640 --> 04:18.640
and I noticed that most of these options are just indicating different plausible methods

04:19.440 --> 04:21.440
through which a person could have been oppressed.

04:21.440 --> 04:25.440
But I can't help but wonder to myself, what the fuck are some of these options?

04:25.440 --> 04:29.440
I have never worked as a waiter, barista, bartender, or salesperson.

04:29.440 --> 04:33.440
So, you're oppressed if you work as a waiter.

04:33.440 --> 04:35.440
I must know your name.

04:36.440 --> 04:37.440
My name?

04:41.440 --> 04:44.440
Who doesn't know what your name is?

04:46.440 --> 04:47.440
Wake me up!

04:48.240 --> 04:49.240
Wake me up!

04:52.240 --> 04:55.240
I have never had to worry about making rent.

04:55.240 --> 05:00.240
So you're privileged if you make fiscally sensible decisions based on your economic outlook

05:00.240 --> 05:03.240
and don't buy things that you can't afford?

05:03.240 --> 05:05.240
I went to summer camp.

05:05.240 --> 05:08.240
Could this be any more irrelevant? What's next?

05:08.240 --> 05:11.240
I played with Legos as a kid? I had a Wii U?

05:11.240 --> 05:14.240
Oh god, now those are the people you should fucking pity.

05:18.240 --> 05:22.240
And of course there's a bunch of options if you've ever been called a derogatory term.

05:22.240 --> 05:26.240
And I agree that these can be really offensive in the wrong context,

05:26.240 --> 05:30.240
but what the fuck does this have to do with someone's privilege?

05:30.240 --> 05:33.240
So, an ignorant dude called you a name you don't like.

05:33.240 --> 05:38.240
Does it really impact you that much to say that you're now less privileged than someone else because of it?

05:38.240 --> 05:40.240
Get away from the door!

05:43.240 --> 05:47.240
There's also a couple of options based on if you've ever felt something.

05:48.040 --> 05:53.040
As if someone's own subjective feelings are relevant to their social status.

05:53.040 --> 05:56.040
Please allow The Rock to explain this to you people.

05:56.040 --> 05:59.040
It doesn't matter how it makes you feel!

06:04.040 --> 06:07.040
And of course there's always the totally rational options of

06:07.040 --> 06:10.040
I am white and I am a man.

06:10.040 --> 06:13.040
Because yeah, fuck white people and fuck men too.

06:13.040 --> 06:14.040
You guys got it too easy.

06:14.040 --> 06:17.040
Maybe you weren't so inflated by your massive privilege.

06:17.040 --> 06:21.040
Your success has nothing to do with your economic standing or anything.

06:21.040 --> 06:24.040
The only thing that matters is good ol' race and gender.

06:24.040 --> 06:25.040
You wanna know who's a white male?

06:25.040 --> 06:26.040
My father!

06:26.040 --> 06:32.040
So, according to Buzzfeed he's been rich and educated his whole life because of his white male privilege, right?

06:32.040 --> 06:33.040
Wrong!

06:33.040 --> 06:38.040
Believe it or not, my dad was on welfare as a kid and he never got a college education.

06:38.040 --> 06:40.040
But rather than wallowing in his own self-pity,

06:40.040 --> 06:44.040
he made something of his life so that I wouldn't have to grow up in those same shitty conditions.

06:44.040 --> 06:48.040
My mom grew up in communist China under fucking Mao.

06:51.040 --> 06:53.040
And she came to America in search of a better life.

06:53.040 --> 06:59.040
And I'm supposed to feel ashamed that my parents improved their lives to the point where I had a good childhood?

06:59.040 --> 07:00.040
Fuck you!

07:03.040 --> 07:05.040
You should never, ever, never,

07:11.040 --> 07:14.040
be made to feel ashamed of who you are.

07:14.040 --> 07:17.040
Number one because your identity is the only thing you really own.

07:17.040 --> 07:21.040
And number two because it's based on factors completely out of your control.

07:21.040 --> 07:23.040
And I get it, okay?

07:23.040 --> 07:27.040
It's important to understand that there are people who are less fortunate than you in this world.

07:27.040 --> 07:28.040
But you know what?

07:28.040 --> 07:29.040
They're not you.

07:29.040 --> 07:33.040
You're the only one who can take control of your life and become the best person you can possibly be.

07:33.040 --> 07:38.040
And no amount of dumb, make-believe privilege is gonna change that.

07:38.040 --> 07:43.040
And it's stupid click-baity BuzzFeed videos like this that get a zillion views on Facebook

07:43.040 --> 07:45.040
and make tons of naive people say,

07:45.040 --> 07:47.040
Oh, why bother improving myself?

07:47.040 --> 07:50.040
I'm clearly so underprivileged.

07:50.040 --> 07:57.040
Man, I hate how heterosexual white males are all super successful because they have so much privilege.

07:59.040 --> 08:00.040
I feel a little sad.

08:00.040 --> 08:03.040
It doesn't matter how it makes you feel!

08:03.040 --> 08:06.040
Ahh! Ahh!

08:06.040 --> 08:08.040
Wah! Wah!

08:08.040 --> 08:10.040
You like that? Huh? You like that?

08:10.040 --> 08:11.040
Wah!

08:14.040 --> 08:15.040
Don't watch BuzzFeed, kids.

08:15.040 --> 08:18.040
Ten million fucking subscribers, my ass.

08:18.040 --> 08:19.040
That's a stupid decision.

08:19.040 --> 08:22.040
That can only be made by a stupid idiot.

08:22.040 --> 08:24.040
Fucking hate idiots, man.

08:24.040 --> 08:26.040
What exactly is my privilege?

08:26.040 --> 08:31.040
I think the word has just become a symbolic issue for powerful groups that feel like they're doing the right thing.

08:31.040 --> 08:32.040
Well, that's retarded.
