00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
So, I like to look at the YouTube trending tab once every couple of days or so.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:13,000
It's a good place to find some interesting content that you couldn't find otherwise through the recommended videos or other means.

3
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:17,000
But the trending tab is without a doubt a mixed bag of content.

4
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:26,500
There's usually a few videos that I enjoy, but most of the videos are really run-of-the-mill mainstream stuff like music videos, talk shows, celebrities, Trump.

5
00:00:26,500 --> 00:00:29,000
Not really stuff that I would want to watch.

6
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
But generally harmless content.

7
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:35,000
But sometimes, I come across that video.

8
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:42,000
A video so insanely idiotic that you can't comprehend what could lead a group of human beings to think this way.

9
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Videos like this.

10
00:00:44,500 --> 00:00:47,000
AHHHH!

11
00:00:51,500 --> 00:00:53,000
Oh.

12
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Ah.

13
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Oh, I'm having a little bit of trouble recording this audio on account of the crushing weight of my privilege on my shoulders.

14
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,740
Oh, wait. There's actually nothing there.

15
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:13,760
It feels like I'm baring. Nothing at all.

16
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:16,500
Nothing at all! Nothing at all!

17
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:19,440
The fuck does check your privilege even mean?

18
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:24,440
I understand that it's supposedly based on the idea of people showing reflexivity

19
00:01:24,440 --> 00:01:28,220
for how people's situations can determine their social standing,

20
00:01:28,420 --> 00:01:30,520
which is admittedly a fair concept.

21
00:01:30,760 --> 00:01:33,720
I don't know, Buzzfeed, what exactly is my privilege?

22
00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:41,480
It has a lot to do with how your identity benefits from a system that has been in place for a very, very long time.

23
00:01:41,480 --> 00:01:43,480
Yeah. Winning the birth lottery.

24
00:01:45,220 --> 00:01:45,720
Loser.

25
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:51,520
You know, if you actually think about it, this is a pretty shitty analogy.

26
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:56,440
Saying that a human being born into a prosperous life is the equivalent of winning a lottery

27
00:01:56,440 --> 00:02:00,640
implies that every human has a random chance of having rich parents or whatever.

28
00:02:00,940 --> 00:02:04,140
No, this is 100% biologically false.

29
00:02:04,140 --> 00:02:11,840
Based on the fact that my specific genes are derived from a specific gene combination from my specific parents,

30
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:17,840
it is physically impossible for me to exist if I was born to any other combination of parents in the world.

31
00:02:18,340 --> 00:02:23,840
Why are you implying that I had a chance not to be born into a middle-class American household?

32
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:31,040
By that logic, should I also chuck my privilege of not being born as a cow, or a bumblebee, or a fucking tree?

33
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:32,640
This is Koo-Allah!

34
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:33,840
Oh my god!

35
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:37,240
The spirit tree! For generations, it has guided-

36
00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:43,840
You have to get us the fuck out of here! These people are backwards savages!

37
00:02:44,140 --> 00:02:51,840
Anyway, the video then presents a spread of people so diverse that it would make PBS television seem bigoted by comparison.

38
00:02:51,840 --> 00:03:04,840
Why does everything have to be about race and gender again? Think about this realistically.

39
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:10,640
Does a person's race or gender really matter when considering their quote-unquote privilege?

40
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:15,640
So, you're saying I should feel sorry for a guy like Michael Jordan who has millions upon millions of dollars

41
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:20,640
and is one of the most well-regarded and widely known, most successful NBA basketball players of all time?

42
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:26,640
You're saying I should feel sorry for him because he's black?

43
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:33,640
So, is Morgan Freeman less privileged than Jack Nicholson because Morgan Freeman is black?

44
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:35,640
What the fuck is this, Yu-Gi-Oh?

45
00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:44,640
You've activated my race card! Since you're a Caucasian type, you gain plus 50 privilege points!

46
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:47,640
Donald Trump got like a thousand percent on this.

47
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:57,640
Ironically, a channel which tries to show how diverse and progressive it is

48
00:03:57,640 --> 00:04:04,640
reveals a pretty implicitly racist message by insinuating that any non-white person needs to be pitied.

49
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:10,640
So anyway, the fucking United Nations takes Buzzfeed's racial shaming quiz.

50
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:14,640
And I'm looking at this totally scientific and non-clickbait quiz

51
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:18,640
and I noticed that most of these options are just indicating different plausible methods

52
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:21,440
through which a person could have been oppressed.

53
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:25,440
But I can't help but wonder to myself, what the fuck are some of these options?

54
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:29,440
I have never worked as a waiter, barista, bartender, or salesperson.

55
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:33,440
So, you're oppressed if you work as a waiter.

56
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:35,440
I must know your name.

57
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:37,440
My name?

58
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:44,440
Who doesn't know what your name is?

59
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:47,440
Wake me up!

60
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:49,240
Wake me up!

61
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:55,240
I have never had to worry about making rent.

62
00:04:55,240 --> 00:05:00,240
So you're privileged if you make fiscally sensible decisions based on your economic outlook

63
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:03,240
and don't buy things that you can't afford?

64
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:05,240
I went to summer camp.

65
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:08,240
Could this be any more irrelevant? What's next?

66
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:11,240
I played with Legos as a kid? I had a Wii U?

67
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:14,240
Oh god, now those are the people you should fucking pity.

68
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:22,240
And of course there's a bunch of options if you've ever been called a derogatory term.

69
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:26,240
And I agree that these can be really offensive in the wrong context,

70
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:30,240
but what the fuck does this have to do with someone's privilege?

71
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:33,240
So, an ignorant dude called you a name you don't like.

72
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:38,240
Does it really impact you that much to say that you're now less privileged than someone else because of it?

73
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:40,240
Get away from the door!

74
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:47,240
There's also a couple of options based on if you've ever felt something.

75
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:53,040
As if someone's own subjective feelings are relevant to their social status.

76
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:56,040
Please allow The Rock to explain this to you people.

77
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:59,040
It doesn't matter how it makes you feel!

78
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:07,040
And of course there's always the totally rational options of

79
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:10,040
I am white and I am a man.

80
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:13,040
Because yeah, fuck white people and fuck men too.

81
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:14,040
You guys got it too easy.

82
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:17,040
Maybe you weren't so inflated by your massive privilege.

83
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:21,040
Your success has nothing to do with your economic standing or anything.

84
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:24,040
The only thing that matters is good ol' race and gender.

85
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:25,040
You wanna know who's a white male?

86
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:26,040
My father!

87
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:32,040
So, according to Buzzfeed he's been rich and educated his whole life because of his white male privilege, right?

88
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:33,040
Wrong!

89
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:38,040
Believe it or not, my dad was on welfare as a kid and he never got a college education.

90
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:40,040
But rather than wallowing in his own self-pity,

91
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:44,040
he made something of his life so that I wouldn't have to grow up in those same shitty conditions.

92
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:48,040
My mom grew up in communist China under fucking Mao.

93
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:53,040
And she came to America in search of a better life.

94
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:59,040
And I'm supposed to feel ashamed that my parents improved their lives to the point where I had a good childhood?

95
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:00,040
Fuck you!

96
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:05,040
You should never, ever, never,

97
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:14,040
be made to feel ashamed of who you are.

98
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:17,040
Number one because your identity is the only thing you really own.

99
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:21,040
And number two because it's based on factors completely out of your control.

100
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:23,040
And I get it, okay?

101
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:27,040
It's important to understand that there are people who are less fortunate than you in this world.

102
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:28,040
But you know what?

103
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:29,040
They're not you.

104
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:33,040
You're the only one who can take control of your life and become the best person you can possibly be.

105
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:38,040
And no amount of dumb, make-believe privilege is gonna change that.

106
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:43,040
And it's stupid click-baity BuzzFeed videos like this that get a zillion views on Facebook

107
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:45,040
and make tons of naive people say,

108
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:47,040
Oh, why bother improving myself?

109
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:50,040
I'm clearly so underprivileged.

110
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:57,040
Man, I hate how heterosexual white males are all super successful because they have so much privilege.

111
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:00,040
I feel a little sad.

112
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:03,040
It doesn't matter how it makes you feel!

113
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:06,040
Ahh! Ahh!

114
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:08,040
Wah! Wah!

115
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:10,040
You like that? Huh? You like that?

116
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:11,040
Wah!

117
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:15,040
Don't watch BuzzFeed, kids.

118
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:18,040
Ten million fucking subscribers, my ass.

119
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:19,040
That's a stupid decision.

120
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:22,040
That can only be made by a stupid idiot.

121
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:24,040
Fucking hate idiots, man.

122
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:26,040
What exactly is my privilege?

123
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:31,040
I think the word has just become a symbolic issue for powerful groups that feel like they're doing the right thing.

124
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:32,040
Well, that's retarded.
