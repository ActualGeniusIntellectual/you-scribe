SSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH

00:13.980 --> 00:15.960
What's up everyone! It's your favorite cartoon reviewer...

00:15.960 --> 00:19.920
here again!!

00:19.920 --> 00:23.140
Doctor MLP BronyAnimeFan3000

00:23.140 --> 00:26.740
back with another

00:26.740 --> 00:27.720
Cartoon Rant!

00:27.720 --> 00:30.840
So today, yeah, today everyone, I'm pissed.

00:30.840 --> 00:38.440
I am angrier than I've ever been in, like, the past seven days, because I have found

00:38.440 --> 00:44.880
one of the worst cartoons I have ever seen on the face of the Earth.

00:44.880 --> 00:52.840
Like, nothing more important on Earth is happening right now than this cartoon, okay?

00:52.840 --> 00:54.420
So I want you all to take a look at this.

00:54.420 --> 00:58.760
I want you all to take a look at this program, right here.

00:58.760 --> 01:05.460
This is Dr. Anime Brony Furry Fan 8000 here, with a special report.

01:05.460 --> 01:06.460
A special report.

01:06.460 --> 01:09.020
I had to drop everything once I saw this.

01:09.020 --> 01:13.660
I was making waffles, I was making scrambled eggs, and I just, that stuff's burning on

01:13.660 --> 01:19.680
the stove right now, because I had to drop everything and just make this rant for you

01:19.680 --> 01:24.080
guys right here, because this is just urgent news.

01:24.080 --> 01:26.720
Everyone needs to hear about this, okay?

01:26.720 --> 01:32.080
So the topic of today's video is the Teletubbies reboot.

01:32.080 --> 01:39.600
I mean, why would you reboot the Teletubbies, one of the most quintessential, just Emmy

01:39.600 --> 01:45.800
award-winning programs for children and adults?

01:45.800 --> 01:51.440
And a lot of people at school make fun of me for watching children's cartoons, but little

01:51.440 --> 01:58.300
do they know that they're all actually idiots, and these cartoons are extremely deep, cinematic

01:58.300 --> 02:00.240
masterpieces meant for adults.

02:00.240 --> 02:10.120
So okay, let's look at the, let's review the new Teletubbies reboot, with, oh my god, why

02:10.120 --> 02:11.200
does this even exist?

02:11.200 --> 02:14.840
I can't even right now, oh my gosh, why do I even bother?

02:14.840 --> 02:19.320
Oh my gosh, the Teletubbies reboot, alright, so let's just get it in.

02:19.320 --> 02:25.800
Okay, so we got the, first of all, they completely ripped off and rehashed the original, like,

02:25.800 --> 02:33.480
at least have some originality, this is the exact same opening as the original Teletubbies.

02:33.480 --> 02:37.800
We got the, okay, first of all, they ruined the baby.

02:37.800 --> 02:45.380
They ruined the baby, the baby's like, the baby's supposed to be, like clearly, the art

02:45.380 --> 02:48.200
style of this new show is completely god-awful.

02:48.200 --> 02:59.920
Oh, the art style, oh, the art style, I mean, look at how good the original looks, like,

02:59.920 --> 03:06.000
you got the, the border of the sun is clearly defined between, like, the corona of the sun

03:06.000 --> 03:12.600
and like, the solar winds, I guess, but here, with the reboot, you can't even tell, and

03:12.600 --> 03:18.640
it's like, who is this ugly-ass baby face here that, why would they pick this baby actor?

03:18.640 --> 03:23.480
Like, this hurts me to look at, and I know, I guess you could kind of argue that that's

03:23.480 --> 03:26.640
a bit ingenious because you shouldn't, it's teaching kids not to look at the sun, but

03:26.640 --> 03:31.880
it's like, I mean, they couldn't have picked a better actor for the sun, I mean, just look

03:31.880 --> 03:38.600
at this, this actor is completely god-awful, compared to the original, who delivers an

03:38.600 --> 03:45.160
Oscar-worthy, an Oscar-worthy performance as a son, I mean, you can't be serious with

03:45.160 --> 03:50.960
this reboot, they're trying to show this stuff to kids, it's ridiculous, and then he looks

03:50.960 --> 03:59.480
down and, no, just look at the art style, oh my god, the art style, it's like this disgusting

03:59.480 --> 04:06.160
CGI blend with real elements, like, what is it, the first one, they just went to like

04:06.160 --> 04:12.080
an old World War II bunker and painted it green, and then they shot this shit, and it

04:12.080 --> 04:18.440
looks great, it looks great, why would anyone want to change this formula, why would you

04:18.440 --> 04:25.200
not want to stray from this, at least if you're going to reboot the series, use this beautifully

04:25.200 --> 04:33.440
designed original set, and it's like, oh look at that, it doesn't even, it's missing the

04:33.440 --> 04:39.400
windmill, how can you make the Teletubbies intro without the windmill, the windmill is

04:39.400 --> 04:44.400
the most important part of the Teletubbies, it's what gives them their powers to transcend

04:44.400 --> 04:50.760
dimensions, you can't have the intro of the Teletubbies without the windmill, oh look

04:50.760 --> 04:55.320
at that, look at that, they completely fucked up the order, they fucked up the order of

04:55.320 --> 05:03.040
the Teletubbies, okay, everyone knows, oh shit, I gotta research the fucking Teletubbies,

05:03.040 --> 05:09.800
which one's the blue one, alright, alright, so let's look at how much they completely

05:09.800 --> 05:14.600
ruined this intro, alright, so Tinky Winky, the blue one, Tinky Winky comes out first,

05:14.600 --> 05:19.600
everyone, alright, at least they're right until that point, but Dipsy, Dipsy comes out

05:19.600 --> 05:24.880
second, no no no no, that's completely wrong, everyone knows, okay, everyone knows friggin'

05:24.880 --> 05:29.760
Lala is supposed to come out second, but the reboot can't even get that right, they can't

05:29.760 --> 05:35.320
even get the order of the Teletubbies right, so Dipsy comes out second, and then, and then

05:35.320 --> 05:41.800
Lala, and then Lala, okay, at least Poe comes out last, so they did get that right at least,

05:41.800 --> 05:46.840
way to completely copy the original, god, can this show be original for one second,

05:46.840 --> 05:57.600
oh, and look at the disgusting 2D animated intro, intro title, compared to the, compared

05:57.600 --> 06:06.400
to the groundbreaking, compared to the groundbreaking 3D balloon text of the original, and once

06:06.400 --> 06:10.880
again, the windmill is completely missing, I mean, we've, we've just watched the intro

06:10.880 --> 06:17.720
so far, and I've ranted about this for 8 minutes, and you can't be serious with this shit, this

06:17.720 --> 06:23.560
show is so infuriating, how can they even broadcast this on television, another thing

06:23.560 --> 06:31.440
I have to mention about the art style, the horrific art style, is, why did they make

06:31.440 --> 06:38.680
this 16x9, who, who wanted the aspect ratio to be 16x9, it looks perfectly fine in the

06:38.680 --> 06:46.000
original, perfectly fine in the 4x3 aspect ratio of the original, but these idiot producers

06:46.000 --> 06:52.120
of the Teletubbies reboot, they couldn't even make it 4x3, like, like it was in my childhood

06:52.120 --> 06:57.720
when it was perfect, they had a perfect formula, and they messed it up, and they need to pay

06:57.720 --> 07:03.880
for this, they need to pay, they must pay for their sins against me, I am personally

07:03.880 --> 07:10.540
insulted by the Teletubbies intro, oh, and finally, finally, a minute and 42 seconds

07:10.540 --> 07:16.600
in to the new Teletubbies, they show the windmill, the windmill is, the windmill is instrumental,

07:16.600 --> 07:22.920
how can you not show the windmill until later, are they relegating the windmill to a minor

07:22.920 --> 07:27.440
character, how can they even do this to me, the windmill is the most important part of

07:27.440 --> 07:33.400
the Teletubbies, and you're gonna relegate it to a minor character, they messed up, ok,

07:33.400 --> 07:41.920
look at this, they messed up the PA system, the Orwellian PA system, they messed it up,

07:41.920 --> 07:48.520
it's supposed to have 11 dimples, as clearly demonstrated by the original, 11 dimples,

07:48.520 --> 07:55.120
right there, and the stupid idiots who made the show, there's only 10 dimples, there's

07:55.120 --> 08:03.680
only 10 dimples on the PA system, like, how could this lack of attention to detail go

08:03.680 --> 08:13.720
over everyone's head, it astounds me, 10 dimples, are you kidding me, the art style

08:13.720 --> 08:22.920
of the show, look how few flowers there are, I mean, this is like looking at Shrek's acne

08:22.920 --> 08:29.080
written back right now, where are the flowers, you gotta balance up the greens, like why

08:29.080 --> 08:35.680
is the screen so green right now, it's repulsing me, it makes me want to vomit in a trash can

08:35.680 --> 08:41.080
right now, all this green, you gotta balance out the colors, by putting flowers on the

08:41.080 --> 08:47.360
side, but oh, I guess flowers are too hard to render in this disgusting CG, oh, the art

08:47.360 --> 08:57.640
style guy, oh, the art style, it's just the worst, the art style, alright, what else is

08:57.640 --> 09:03.800
there to talk about in the show, I mean, the footage speaks for itself folks, just

09:03.800 --> 09:11.960
look how bad this is, they completely mischaracterize the characters too, okay, so it's like, Poe

09:11.960 --> 09:16.320
is supposed to be the smaller, he's supposed to get shit on by all the others, the others,

09:16.320 --> 09:22.580
shit on Poe, but it's supposed to teach kids a valuable lesson about bullying, yeah, so

09:22.580 --> 09:27.620
I was bullied a lot in school, but because I watched the Teletubbies, I knew how to prevent

09:27.620 --> 09:34.260
it, and kids today aren't gonna know that, because the character Poe is completely mischaracterized,

09:34.260 --> 09:39.140
it's like, how can you not show Poe being just shit on by all the rest of the characters,

09:39.140 --> 09:45.020
that's completely ridiculous, you're basically just making every character completely bland,

09:45.020 --> 09:51.420
and what's the point of that, like children watch TV shows to empathize with the characters

09:51.420 --> 09:57.300
and follow them through a coherent plot, why are you ruining these characters that

09:57.300 --> 10:02.180
we love as a kid, you're physically insulting me right now, you're physically attacking

10:02.180 --> 10:06.340
me because when I watch this show, I feel physically ill, and I just want you all to

10:06.340 --> 10:13.520
know, like anyone behind this show, that you have just ruined my day for having to sit

10:13.520 --> 10:20.840
through this and watch this content, it's just disgusting, and now Poe is leading, Poe

10:20.840 --> 10:26.960
is leading, so you completely, so not only have you marginalized all these characters

10:26.960 --> 10:34.760
into just completely bland cutouts of the original incredibly complex and dynamic Teletubbies,

10:34.760 --> 10:38.680
you make Poe the leader, you've completely wrapped everything around, so they're like,

10:38.680 --> 10:43.440
did these people even watch the original Teletubbies?

10:43.440 --> 10:48.380
So they completely fucked up the design of the Windmill, so the original Windmill is

10:48.380 --> 10:54.800
supposed to be this four pronged wind turbine system, and this one is just, the Windmill

10:54.800 --> 11:00.840
in the rebuild is just like this pinwheel design, like what were they thinking, why

11:00.840 --> 11:07.360
would you mess up the Windmill, the most important character is the Windmill, and maybe the Sun

11:07.360 --> 11:13.720
baby, but they completely messed this up, and the art style, and the characters, it's

11:13.720 --> 11:21.980
just atrocious, oh look at this, look at this, this is the worst, this is the worst thing

11:21.980 --> 11:27.320
they could have possibly done, they made the Windmill sparkles green, everyone knows the

11:27.320 --> 11:32.460
Teletubbies Windmill sparkles are supposed to be red, okay, it's supposed to be like

11:32.460 --> 11:38.800
pinkish, light red, that's what gives them the power, it's because it's red, it's because

11:38.800 --> 11:44.360
Poe, Poe's color is red, and Poe is the most important character, because he's the character

11:44.360 --> 11:51.420
that gets bullied by all the rest of them, and it's showing that it was supposed to empathize

11:51.420 --> 11:57.700
with Poe, that's a very important detail that they just tossed aside for this reboot, and

11:57.700 --> 12:06.460
they made it green, why are the windmill sparkles green, why are the windmill sparkles green,

12:06.460 --> 12:14.180
you made it the color of Dipsy, Dipsy, the brown Teletubby, is this some sort of affirmative

12:14.180 --> 12:20.340
action, social justice nonsense, of course you make the windmill sparkles green, okay,

12:20.340 --> 12:26.300
you helped out the dark skinned one, like why would this even need to be a thing, they

12:26.300 --> 12:30.540
completely mischaracterized these characters, and they're trying to mess with the windmill

12:30.540 --> 12:37.420
sparkle formula, and they're just completely missing the subtext, the brilliant subtext

12:37.420 --> 12:43.980
of the original series, and okay, so let's talk about, let's talk about the real world

12:43.980 --> 12:49.740
version of the Teletubbies, okay, because you know in the original they do these brilliant,

12:49.740 --> 12:57.900
these seamless transitions into reality, and they show like a kid playing with these really

12:57.900 --> 13:02.860
awesome toys that are really fun, so it's like look here, look in the original one,

13:02.860 --> 13:08.100
they have this nice little farm place, and it's like really chill, and it's like oh my

13:08.100 --> 13:13.580
god, toy horses, those are awesome, look at this, you can like race the horses, and it's

13:13.580 --> 13:18.500
like oh look, I'm running a farm, but it's not, because it's in my imagination, and imagination

13:18.500 --> 13:26.500
is like the most powerful thing, but it's like super chill, there's like lambs and sheep,

13:26.500 --> 13:34.020
and it's like I got the tractor, the complete set, and it's like hell yeah, give me those

13:34.020 --> 13:41.820
awesome toys I want to play, but in the new Teletubbies, in the Teletubbies reboot,

13:41.820 --> 13:46.660
they completely messed this up, again, as usual like why am I not surprised at this point,

13:46.660 --> 13:53.780
how could a show possibly be this incompetent, they mess up the kitty kid play time in the

13:53.780 --> 13:59.380
bedroom floor, so now you got this kid in a wheelchair, like I don't want to learn about

13:59.380 --> 14:04.780
kids in wheelchairs, like that just makes me sad, I just want to play with toys on a

14:04.780 --> 14:11.820
farm, and it's like, you're putting them, look this is terrifying, he's in a wheelchair,

14:11.820 --> 14:17.220
why is he even in this precarious predicament in the first place, like this is teaching

14:17.220 --> 14:23.460
kids to just not fear high places, high places are terrifying, I don't want to be in a high

14:23.460 --> 14:29.500
place, this kid's in a wheelchair, is it because he fell off a high place in the first place,

14:29.500 --> 14:35.100
why is he even here, I want to go back to the little girl in the yellow shirts room,

14:35.100 --> 14:46.340
and play with farm animal toys, I want to go to this horrifying, it's horrifying, it's

14:46.340 --> 14:53.700
horrifying, why would they think this was appropriate to children, and I don't know,

14:53.700 --> 14:57.380
from an adult perspective, it's completely, it's completely unattainable, like the horses

14:57.380 --> 15:04.540
you got, the horses man, it's like, have you ever seen a horse in real life, they're all

15:04.540 --> 15:09.020
over my favorite show, My Little Pony, Friendship is Magic, but have you ever just seen a horse

15:09.020 --> 15:18.020
in real life, it's a majestic creature, okay, and she had like three horse toys, but what

15:18.020 --> 15:26.660
the reboot can't get right, is that no kid wants to go up to a high place and like, nobody

15:26.660 --> 15:33.380
cares about that shit, okay, everyone wants to play with farm animal toys, but who the

15:33.380 --> 15:38.620
heck wants to go up to a horrifying place, where you might fall and just kill yourself

15:38.620 --> 15:45.860
by hitting the ground too hard, you know, blatant Windows product placement here, like

15:45.860 --> 15:51.060
how can you be, like I remember when cartoons were just cartoons, you know, and you could

15:51.060 --> 15:57.900
just watch them without having a freaking Windows ad play on your screen every ten seconds,

15:57.900 --> 16:06.820
and all of a sudden you got to integrate Windows to kid and Windows Phone and playing Minecraft,

16:06.820 --> 16:15.100
Jesus Christ, this is some of the worst content I've ever seen, and I don't know, I think

16:15.100 --> 16:20.780
it should just be taken off the air entirely, because I don't like it, like to hell with

16:20.780 --> 16:26.820
all the kids who like it, like they're idiots, okay, this is the worst piece of programming

16:26.820 --> 16:33.980
I've ever witnessed, and we should riot in the streets, and we should, we should just

16:33.980 --> 16:40.060
like, we should go to Congress, we should go to Congress in whatever country, or just

16:40.060 --> 16:45.900
go to your Congressman, go to your government, and just like, just like throw stones at them

16:45.900 --> 16:50.860
or something, or I don't know, like yell at them, get like a megaphone, and like try to

16:50.860 --> 16:55.180
scream at them, maybe they can hear you, and try to take this stuff off the air, like this

16:55.180 --> 17:01.400
is completely disgusting, why would they allow this to air on television, they took

17:01.400 --> 17:07.060
a great series in the Teletubbies, and they completely ruined it, and I think that's just

17:07.060 --> 17:15.100
unacceptable, so yeah, thanks for watching this cartoon rant, make sure to subscribe
