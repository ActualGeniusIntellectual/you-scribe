13980	15960	What's up everyone! It's your favorite cartoon reviewer...
15960	19920	here again!!
19920	23140	Doctor MLP BronyAnimeFan3000
23140	26740	back with another
26740	27720	Cartoon Rant!
27720	30840	So today, yeah, today everyone, I'm pissed.
30840	38440	I am angrier than I've ever been in, like, the past seven days, because I have found
38440	44880	one of the worst cartoons I have ever seen on the face of the Earth.
44880	52840	Like, nothing more important on Earth is happening right now than this cartoon, okay?
52840	54420	So I want you all to take a look at this.
54420	58760	I want you all to take a look at this program, right here.
58760	65460	This is Dr. Anime Brony Furry Fan 8000 here, with a special report.
65460	66460	A special report.
66460	69020	I had to drop everything once I saw this.
69020	73660	I was making waffles, I was making scrambled eggs, and I just, that stuff's burning on
73660	79680	the stove right now, because I had to drop everything and just make this rant for you
79680	84080	guys right here, because this is just urgent news.
84080	86720	Everyone needs to hear about this, okay?
86720	92080	So the topic of today's video is the Teletubbies reboot.
92080	99600	I mean, why would you reboot the Teletubbies, one of the most quintessential, just Emmy
99600	105800	award-winning programs for children and adults?
105800	111440	And a lot of people at school make fun of me for watching children's cartoons, but little
111440	118300	do they know that they're all actually idiots, and these cartoons are extremely deep, cinematic
118300	120240	masterpieces meant for adults.
120240	130120	So okay, let's look at the, let's review the new Teletubbies reboot, with, oh my god, why
130120	131200	does this even exist?
131200	134840	I can't even right now, oh my gosh, why do I even bother?
134840	139320	Oh my gosh, the Teletubbies reboot, alright, so let's just get it in.
139320	145800	Okay, so we got the, first of all, they completely ripped off and rehashed the original, like,
145800	153480	at least have some originality, this is the exact same opening as the original Teletubbies.
153480	157800	We got the, okay, first of all, they ruined the baby.
157800	165380	They ruined the baby, the baby's like, the baby's supposed to be, like clearly, the art
165380	168200	style of this new show is completely god-awful.
168200	179920	Oh, the art style, oh, the art style, I mean, look at how good the original looks, like,
179920	186000	you got the, the border of the sun is clearly defined between, like, the corona of the sun
186000	192600	and like, the solar winds, I guess, but here, with the reboot, you can't even tell, and
192600	198640	it's like, who is this ugly-ass baby face here that, why would they pick this baby actor?
198640	203480	Like, this hurts me to look at, and I know, I guess you could kind of argue that that's
203480	206640	a bit ingenious because you shouldn't, it's teaching kids not to look at the sun, but
206640	211880	it's like, I mean, they couldn't have picked a better actor for the sun, I mean, just look
211880	218600	at this, this actor is completely god-awful, compared to the original, who delivers an
218600	225160	Oscar-worthy, an Oscar-worthy performance as a son, I mean, you can't be serious with
225160	230960	this reboot, they're trying to show this stuff to kids, it's ridiculous, and then he looks
230960	239480	down and, no, just look at the art style, oh my god, the art style, it's like this disgusting
239480	246160	CGI blend with real elements, like, what is it, the first one, they just went to like
246160	252080	an old World War II bunker and painted it green, and then they shot this shit, and it
252080	258440	looks great, it looks great, why would anyone want to change this formula, why would you
258440	265200	not want to stray from this, at least if you're going to reboot the series, use this beautifully
265200	273440	designed original set, and it's like, oh look at that, it doesn't even, it's missing the
273440	279400	windmill, how can you make the Teletubbies intro without the windmill, the windmill is
279400	284400	the most important part of the Teletubbies, it's what gives them their powers to transcend
284400	290760	dimensions, you can't have the intro of the Teletubbies without the windmill, oh look
290760	295320	at that, look at that, they completely fucked up the order, they fucked up the order of
295320	303040	the Teletubbies, okay, everyone knows, oh shit, I gotta research the fucking Teletubbies,
303040	309800	which one's the blue one, alright, alright, so let's look at how much they completely
309800	314600	ruined this intro, alright, so Tinky Winky, the blue one, Tinky Winky comes out first,
314600	319600	everyone, alright, at least they're right until that point, but Dipsy, Dipsy comes out
319600	324880	second, no no no no, that's completely wrong, everyone knows, okay, everyone knows friggin'
324880	329760	Lala is supposed to come out second, but the reboot can't even get that right, they can't
329760	335320	even get the order of the Teletubbies right, so Dipsy comes out second, and then, and then
335320	341800	Lala, and then Lala, okay, at least Poe comes out last, so they did get that right at least,
341800	346840	way to completely copy the original, god, can this show be original for one second,
346840	357600	oh, and look at the disgusting 2D animated intro, intro title, compared to the, compared
357600	366400	to the groundbreaking, compared to the groundbreaking 3D balloon text of the original, and once
366400	370880	again, the windmill is completely missing, I mean, we've, we've just watched the intro
370880	377720	so far, and I've ranted about this for 8 minutes, and you can't be serious with this shit, this
377720	383560	show is so infuriating, how can they even broadcast this on television, another thing
383560	391440	I have to mention about the art style, the horrific art style, is, why did they make
391440	398680	this 16x9, who, who wanted the aspect ratio to be 16x9, it looks perfectly fine in the
398680	406000	original, perfectly fine in the 4x3 aspect ratio of the original, but these idiot producers
406000	412120	of the Teletubbies reboot, they couldn't even make it 4x3, like, like it was in my childhood
412120	417720	when it was perfect, they had a perfect formula, and they messed it up, and they need to pay
417720	423880	for this, they need to pay, they must pay for their sins against me, I am personally
423880	430540	insulted by the Teletubbies intro, oh, and finally, finally, a minute and 42 seconds
430540	436600	in to the new Teletubbies, they show the windmill, the windmill is, the windmill is instrumental,
436600	442920	how can you not show the windmill until later, are they relegating the windmill to a minor
442920	447440	character, how can they even do this to me, the windmill is the most important part of
447440	453400	the Teletubbies, and you're gonna relegate it to a minor character, they messed up, ok,
453400	461920	look at this, they messed up the PA system, the Orwellian PA system, they messed it up,
461920	468520	it's supposed to have 11 dimples, as clearly demonstrated by the original, 11 dimples,
468520	475120	right there, and the stupid idiots who made the show, there's only 10 dimples, there's
475120	483680	only 10 dimples on the PA system, like, how could this lack of attention to detail go
483680	493720	over everyone's head, it astounds me, 10 dimples, are you kidding me, the art style
493720	502920	of the show, look how few flowers there are, I mean, this is like looking at Shrek's acne
502920	509080	written back right now, where are the flowers, you gotta balance up the greens, like why
509080	515680	is the screen so green right now, it's repulsing me, it makes me want to vomit in a trash can
515680	521080	right now, all this green, you gotta balance out the colors, by putting flowers on the
521080	527360	side, but oh, I guess flowers are too hard to render in this disgusting CG, oh, the art
527360	537640	style guy, oh, the art style, it's just the worst, the art style, alright, what else is
537640	543800	there to talk about in the show, I mean, the footage speaks for itself folks, just
543800	551960	look how bad this is, they completely mischaracterize the characters too, okay, so it's like, Poe
551960	556320	is supposed to be the smaller, he's supposed to get shit on by all the others, the others,
556320	562580	shit on Poe, but it's supposed to teach kids a valuable lesson about bullying, yeah, so
562580	567620	I was bullied a lot in school, but because I watched the Teletubbies, I knew how to prevent
567620	574260	it, and kids today aren't gonna know that, because the character Poe is completely mischaracterized,
574260	579140	it's like, how can you not show Poe being just shit on by all the rest of the characters,
579140	585020	that's completely ridiculous, you're basically just making every character completely bland,
585020	591420	and what's the point of that, like children watch TV shows to empathize with the characters
591420	597300	and follow them through a coherent plot, why are you ruining these characters that
597300	602180	we love as a kid, you're physically insulting me right now, you're physically attacking
602180	606340	me because when I watch this show, I feel physically ill, and I just want you all to
606340	613520	know, like anyone behind this show, that you have just ruined my day for having to sit
613520	620840	through this and watch this content, it's just disgusting, and now Poe is leading, Poe
620840	626960	is leading, so you completely, so not only have you marginalized all these characters
626960	634760	into just completely bland cutouts of the original incredibly complex and dynamic Teletubbies,
634760	638680	you make Poe the leader, you've completely wrapped everything around, so they're like,
638680	643440	did these people even watch the original Teletubbies?
643440	648380	So they completely fucked up the design of the Windmill, so the original Windmill is
648380	654800	supposed to be this four pronged wind turbine system, and this one is just, the Windmill
654800	660840	in the rebuild is just like this pinwheel design, like what were they thinking, why
660840	667360	would you mess up the Windmill, the most important character is the Windmill, and maybe the Sun
667360	673720	baby, but they completely messed this up, and the art style, and the characters, it's
673720	681980	just atrocious, oh look at this, look at this, this is the worst, this is the worst thing
681980	687320	they could have possibly done, they made the Windmill sparkles green, everyone knows the
687320	692460	Teletubbies Windmill sparkles are supposed to be red, okay, it's supposed to be like
692460	698800	pinkish, light red, that's what gives them the power, it's because it's red, it's because
698800	704360	Poe, Poe's color is red, and Poe is the most important character, because he's the character
704360	711420	that gets bullied by all the rest of them, and it's showing that it was supposed to empathize
711420	717700	with Poe, that's a very important detail that they just tossed aside for this reboot, and
717700	726460	they made it green, why are the windmill sparkles green, why are the windmill sparkles green,
726460	734180	you made it the color of Dipsy, Dipsy, the brown Teletubby, is this some sort of affirmative
734180	740340	action, social justice nonsense, of course you make the windmill sparkles green, okay,
740340	746300	you helped out the dark skinned one, like why would this even need to be a thing, they
746300	750540	completely mischaracterized these characters, and they're trying to mess with the windmill
750540	757420	sparkle formula, and they're just completely missing the subtext, the brilliant subtext
757420	763980	of the original series, and okay, so let's talk about, let's talk about the real world
763980	769740	version of the Teletubbies, okay, because you know in the original they do these brilliant,
769740	777900	these seamless transitions into reality, and they show like a kid playing with these really
777900	782860	awesome toys that are really fun, so it's like look here, look in the original one,
782860	788100	they have this nice little farm place, and it's like really chill, and it's like oh my
788100	793580	god, toy horses, those are awesome, look at this, you can like race the horses, and it's
793580	798500	like oh look, I'm running a farm, but it's not, because it's in my imagination, and imagination
798500	806500	is like the most powerful thing, but it's like super chill, there's like lambs and sheep,
806500	814020	and it's like I got the tractor, the complete set, and it's like hell yeah, give me those
814020	821820	awesome toys I want to play, but in the new Teletubbies, in the Teletubbies reboot,
821820	826660	they completely messed this up, again, as usual like why am I not surprised at this point,
826660	833780	how could a show possibly be this incompetent, they mess up the kitty kid play time in the
833780	839380	bedroom floor, so now you got this kid in a wheelchair, like I don't want to learn about
839380	844780	kids in wheelchairs, like that just makes me sad, I just want to play with toys on a
844780	851820	farm, and it's like, you're putting them, look this is terrifying, he's in a wheelchair,
851820	857220	why is he even in this precarious predicament in the first place, like this is teaching
857220	863460	kids to just not fear high places, high places are terrifying, I don't want to be in a high
863460	869500	place, this kid's in a wheelchair, is it because he fell off a high place in the first place,
869500	875100	why is he even here, I want to go back to the little girl in the yellow shirts room,
875100	886340	and play with farm animal toys, I want to go to this horrifying, it's horrifying, it's
886340	893700	horrifying, why would they think this was appropriate to children, and I don't know,
893700	897380	from an adult perspective, it's completely, it's completely unattainable, like the horses
897380	904540	you got, the horses man, it's like, have you ever seen a horse in real life, they're all
904540	909020	over my favorite show, My Little Pony, Friendship is Magic, but have you ever just seen a horse
909020	918020	in real life, it's a majestic creature, okay, and she had like three horse toys, but what
918020	926660	the reboot can't get right, is that no kid wants to go up to a high place and like, nobody
926660	933380	cares about that shit, okay, everyone wants to play with farm animal toys, but who the
933380	938620	heck wants to go up to a horrifying place, where you might fall and just kill yourself
938620	945860	by hitting the ground too hard, you know, blatant Windows product placement here, like
945860	951060	how can you be, like I remember when cartoons were just cartoons, you know, and you could
951060	957900	just watch them without having a freaking Windows ad play on your screen every ten seconds,
957900	966820	and all of a sudden you got to integrate Windows to kid and Windows Phone and playing Minecraft,
966820	975100	Jesus Christ, this is some of the worst content I've ever seen, and I don't know, I think
975100	980780	it should just be taken off the air entirely, because I don't like it, like to hell with
980780	986820	all the kids who like it, like they're idiots, okay, this is the worst piece of programming
986820	993980	I've ever witnessed, and we should riot in the streets, and we should, we should just
993980	1000060	like, we should go to Congress, we should go to Congress in whatever country, or just
1000060	1005900	go to your Congressman, go to your government, and just like, just like throw stones at them
1005900	1010860	or something, or I don't know, like yell at them, get like a megaphone, and like try to
1010860	1015180	scream at them, maybe they can hear you, and try to take this stuff off the air, like this
1015180	1021400	is completely disgusting, why would they allow this to air on television, they took
1021400	1027060	a great series in the Teletubbies, and they completely ruined it, and I think that's just
1027060	1035100	unacceptable, so yeah, thanks for watching this cartoon rant, make sure to subscribe
