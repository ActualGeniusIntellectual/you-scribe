00:00:13,980 --> 00:00:15,960

00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:19,920

00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:23,140
Doctor MLP BronyAnimeFan3000

5
00:00:23,140 --> 00:00:26,740
back with another

6
00:00:26,740 --> 00:00:27,720
Cartoon Rant!

7
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:30,840
So today, yeah, today everyone, I'm pissed.

8
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:38,440
I am angrier than I've ever been in, like, the past seven days, because I have found

9
00:00:38,440 --> 00:00:44,880
one of the worst cartoons I have ever seen on the face of the Earth.

10
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:52,840
Like, nothing more important on Earth is happening right now than this cartoon, okay?

11
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:54,420
So I want you all to take a look at this.

12
00:00:54,420 --> 00:00:58,760
I want you all to take a look at this program, right here.

13
00:00:58,760 --> 00:01:05,460
This is Dr. Anime Brony Furry Fan 8000 here, with a special report.

14
00:01:05,460 --> 00:01:06,460
A special report.

15
00:01:06,460 --> 00:01:09,020
I had to drop everything once I saw this.

16
00:01:09,020 --> 00:01:13,660
I was making waffles, I was making scrambled eggs, and I just, that stuff's burning on

17
00:01:13,660 --> 00:01:19,680
the stove right now, because I had to drop everything and just make this rant for you

18
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:24,080
guys right here, because this is just urgent news.

19
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:26,720
Everyone needs to hear about this, okay?

20
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:32,080
So the topic of today's video is the Teletubbies reboot.

21
00:01:32,080 --> 00:01:39,600
I mean, why would you reboot the Teletubbies, one of the most quintessential, just Emmy

22
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:45,800
award-winning programs for children and adults?

23
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:51,440
And a lot of people at school make fun of me for watching children's cartoons, but little

24
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:58,300
do they know that they're all actually idiots, and these cartoons are extremely deep, cinematic

25
00:01:58,300 --> 00:02:00,240
masterpieces meant for adults.

26
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:10,120
So okay, let's look at the, let's review the new Teletubbies reboot, with, oh my god, why

27
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:11,200
does this even exist?

28
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:14,840
I can't even right now, oh my gosh, why do I even bother?

29
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:19,320
Oh my gosh, the Teletubbies reboot, alright, so let's just get it in.

30
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:25,800
Okay, so we got the, first of all, they completely ripped off and rehashed the original, like,

31
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:33,480
at least have some originality, this is the exact same opening as the original Teletubbies.

32
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:37,800
We got the, okay, first of all, they ruined the baby.

33
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:45,380
They ruined the baby, the baby's like, the baby's supposed to be, like clearly, the art

34
00:02:45,380 --> 00:02:48,200
style of this new show is completely god-awful.

35
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:59,920
Oh, the art style, oh, the art style, I mean, look at how good the original looks, like,

36
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:06,000
you got the, the border of the sun is clearly defined between, like, the corona of the sun

37
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:12,600
and like, the solar winds, I guess, but here, with the reboot, you can't even tell, and

38
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:18,640
it's like, who is this ugly-ass baby face here that, why would they pick this baby actor?

39
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:23,480
Like, this hurts me to look at, and I know, I guess you could kind of argue that that's

40
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:26,640
a bit ingenious because you shouldn't, it's teaching kids not to look at the sun, but

41
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:31,880
it's like, I mean, they couldn't have picked a better actor for the sun, I mean, just look

42
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:38,600
at this, this actor is completely god-awful, compared to the original, who delivers an

43
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:45,160
Oscar-worthy, an Oscar-worthy performance as a son, I mean, you can't be serious with

44
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:50,960
this reboot, they're trying to show this stuff to kids, it's ridiculous, and then he looks

45
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:59,480
down and, no, just look at the art style, oh my god, the art style, it's like this disgusting

46
00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:06,160
CGI blend with real elements, like, what is it, the first one, they just went to like

47
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:12,080
an old World War II bunker and painted it green, and then they shot this shit, and it

48
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:18,440
looks great, it looks great, why would anyone want to change this formula, why would you

49
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:25,200
not want to stray from this, at least if you're going to reboot the series, use this beautifully

50
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:33,440
designed original set, and it's like, oh look at that, it doesn't even, it's missing the

51
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:39,400
windmill, how can you make the Teletubbies intro without the windmill, the windmill is

52
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:44,400
the most important part of the Teletubbies, it's what gives them their powers to transcend

53
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:50,760
dimensions, you can't have the intro of the Teletubbies without the windmill, oh look

54
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:55,320
at that, look at that, they completely fucked up the order, they fucked up the order of

55
00:04:55,320 --> 00:05:03,040
the Teletubbies, okay, everyone knows, oh shit, I gotta research the fucking Teletubbies,

56
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:09,800
which one's the blue one, alright, alright, so let's look at how much they completely

57
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:14,600
ruined this intro, alright, so Tinky Winky, the blue one, Tinky Winky comes out first,

58
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:19,600
everyone, alright, at least they're right until that point, but Dipsy, Dipsy comes out

59
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:24,880
second, no no no no, that's completely wrong, everyone knows, okay, everyone knows friggin'

60
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:29,760
Lala is supposed to come out second, but the reboot can't even get that right, they can't

61
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:35,320
even get the order of the Teletubbies right, so Dipsy comes out second, and then, and then

62
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:41,800
Lala, and then Lala, okay, at least Poe comes out last, so they did get that right at least,

63
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:46,840
way to completely copy the original, god, can this show be original for one second,

64
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:57,600
oh, and look at the disgusting 2D animated intro, intro title, compared to the, compared

65
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:06,400
to the groundbreaking, compared to the groundbreaking 3D balloon text of the original, and once

66
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:10,880
again, the windmill is completely missing, I mean, we've, we've just watched the intro

67
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:17,720
so far, and I've ranted about this for 8 minutes, and you can't be serious with this shit, this

68
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:23,560
show is so infuriating, how can they even broadcast this on television, another thing

69
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:31,440
I have to mention about the art style, the horrific art style, is, why did they make

70
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:38,680
this 16x9, who, who wanted the aspect ratio to be 16x9, it looks perfectly fine in the

71
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:46,000
original, perfectly fine in the 4x3 aspect ratio of the original, but these idiot producers

72
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:52,120
of the Teletubbies reboot, they couldn't even make it 4x3, like, like it was in my childhood

73
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:57,720
when it was perfect, they had a perfect formula, and they messed it up, and they need to pay

74
00:06:57,720 --> 00:07:03,880
for this, they need to pay, they must pay for their sins against me, I am personally

75
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:10,540
insulted by the Teletubbies intro, oh, and finally, finally, a minute and 42 seconds

76
00:07:10,540 --> 00:07:16,600
in to the new Teletubbies, they show the windmill, the windmill is, the windmill is instrumental,

77
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:22,920
how can you not show the windmill until later, are they relegating the windmill to a minor

78
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:27,440
character, how can they even do this to me, the windmill is the most important part of

79
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:33,400
the Teletubbies, and you're gonna relegate it to a minor character, they messed up, ok,

80
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:41,920
look at this, they messed up the PA system, the Orwellian PA system, they messed it up,

81
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:48,520
it's supposed to have 11 dimples, as clearly demonstrated by the original, 11 dimples,

82
00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:55,120
right there, and the stupid idiots who made the show, there's only 10 dimples, there's

83
00:07:55,120 --> 00:08:03,680
only 10 dimples on the PA system, like, how could this lack of attention to detail go

84
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:13,720
over everyone's head, it astounds me, 10 dimples, are you kidding me, the art style

85
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:22,920
of the show, look how few flowers there are, I mean, this is like looking at Shrek's acne

86
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:29,080
written back right now, where are the flowers, you gotta balance up the greens, like why

87
00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:35,680
is the screen so green right now, it's repulsing me, it makes me want to vomit in a trash can

88
00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:41,080
right now, all this green, you gotta balance out the colors, by putting flowers on the

89
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:47,360
side, but oh, I guess flowers are too hard to render in this disgusting CG, oh, the art

90
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:57,640
style guy, oh, the art style, it's just the worst, the art style, alright, what else is

91
00:08:57,640 --> 00:09:03,800
there to talk about in the show, I mean, the footage speaks for itself folks, just

92
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:11,960
look how bad this is, they completely mischaracterize the characters too, okay, so it's like, Poe

93
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:16,320
is supposed to be the smaller, he's supposed to get shit on by all the others, the others,

94
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:22,580
shit on Poe, but it's supposed to teach kids a valuable lesson about bullying, yeah, so

95
00:09:22,580 --> 00:09:27,620
I was bullied a lot in school, but because I watched the Teletubbies, I knew how to prevent

96
00:09:27,620 --> 00:09:34,260
it, and kids today aren't gonna know that, because the character Poe is completely mischaracterized,

97
00:09:34,260 --> 00:09:39,140
it's like, how can you not show Poe being just shit on by all the rest of the characters,

98
00:09:39,140 --> 00:09:45,020
that's completely ridiculous, you're basically just making every character completely bland,

99
00:09:45,020 --> 00:09:51,420
and what's the point of that, like children watch TV shows to empathize with the characters

100
00:09:51,420 --> 00:09:57,300
and follow them through a coherent plot, why are you ruining these characters that

101
00:09:57,300 --> 00:10:02,180
we love as a kid, you're physically insulting me right now, you're physically attacking

102
00:10:02,180 --> 00:10:06,340
me because when I watch this show, I feel physically ill, and I just want you all to

103
00:10:06,340 --> 00:10:13,520
know, like anyone behind this show, that you have just ruined my day for having to sit

104
00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:20,840
through this and watch this content, it's just disgusting, and now Poe is leading, Poe

105
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:26,960
is leading, so you completely, so not only have you marginalized all these characters

106
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:34,760
into just completely bland cutouts of the original incredibly complex and dynamic Teletubbies,

107
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:38,680
you make Poe the leader, you've completely wrapped everything around, so they're like,

108
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:43,440
did these people even watch the original Teletubbies?

109
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:48,380
So they completely fucked up the design of the Windmill, so the original Windmill is

110
00:10:48,380 --> 00:10:54,800
supposed to be this four pronged wind turbine system, and this one is just, the Windmill

111
00:10:54,800 --> 00:11:00,840
in the rebuild is just like this pinwheel design, like what were they thinking, why

112
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:07,360
would you mess up the Windmill, the most important character is the Windmill, and maybe the Sun

113
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:13,720
baby, but they completely messed this up, and the art style, and the characters, it's

114
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:21,980
just atrocious, oh look at this, look at this, this is the worst, this is the worst thing

115
00:11:21,980 --> 00:11:27,320
they could have possibly done, they made the Windmill sparkles green, everyone knows the

116
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:32,460
Teletubbies Windmill sparkles are supposed to be red, okay, it's supposed to be like

117
00:11:32,460 --> 00:11:38,800
pinkish, light red, that's what gives them the power, it's because it's red, it's because

118
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:44,360
Poe, Poe's color is red, and Poe is the most important character, because he's the character

119
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:51,420
that gets bullied by all the rest of them, and it's showing that it was supposed to empathize

120
00:11:51,420 --> 00:11:57,700
with Poe, that's a very important detail that they just tossed aside for this reboot, and

121
00:11:57,700 --> 00:12:06,460
they made it green, why are the windmill sparkles green, why are the windmill sparkles green,

122
00:12:06,460 --> 00:12:14,180
you made it the color of Dipsy, Dipsy, the brown Teletubby, is this some sort of affirmative

123
00:12:14,180 --> 00:12:20,340
action, social justice nonsense, of course you make the windmill sparkles green, okay,

124
00:12:20,340 --> 00:12:26,300
you helped out the dark skinned one, like why would this even need to be a thing, they

125
00:12:26,300 --> 00:12:30,540
completely mischaracterized these characters, and they're trying to mess with the windmill

126
00:12:30,540 --> 00:12:37,420
sparkle formula, and they're just completely missing the subtext, the brilliant subtext

127
00:12:37,420 --> 00:12:43,980
of the original series, and okay, so let's talk about, let's talk about the real world

128
00:12:43,980 --> 00:12:49,740
version of the Teletubbies, okay, because you know in the original they do these brilliant,

129
00:12:49,740 --> 00:12:57,900
these seamless transitions into reality, and they show like a kid playing with these really

130
00:12:57,900 --> 00:13:02,860
awesome toys that are really fun, so it's like look here, look in the original one,

131
00:13:02,860 --> 00:13:08,100
they have this nice little farm place, and it's like really chill, and it's like oh my

132
00:13:08,100 --> 00:13:13,580
god, toy horses, those are awesome, look at this, you can like race the horses, and it's

133
00:13:13,580 --> 00:13:18,500
like oh look, I'm running a farm, but it's not, because it's in my imagination, and imagination

134
00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:26,500
is like the most powerful thing, but it's like super chill, there's like lambs and sheep,

135
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:34,020
and it's like I got the tractor, the complete set, and it's like hell yeah, give me those

136
00:13:34,020 --> 00:13:41,820
awesome toys I want to play, but in the new Teletubbies, in the Teletubbies reboot,

137
00:13:41,820 --> 00:13:46,660
they completely messed this up, again, as usual like why am I not surprised at this point,

138
00:13:46,660 --> 00:13:53,780
how could a show possibly be this incompetent, they mess up the kitty kid play time in the

139
00:13:53,780 --> 00:13:59,380
bedroom floor, so now you got this kid in a wheelchair, like I don't want to learn about

140
00:13:59,380 --> 00:14:04,780
kids in wheelchairs, like that just makes me sad, I just want to play with toys on a

141
00:14:04,780 --> 00:14:11,820
farm, and it's like, you're putting them, look this is terrifying, he's in a wheelchair,

142
00:14:11,820 --> 00:14:17,220
why is he even in this precarious predicament in the first place, like this is teaching

143
00:14:17,220 --> 00:14:23,460
kids to just not fear high places, high places are terrifying, I don't want to be in a high

144
00:14:23,460 --> 00:14:29,500
place, this kid's in a wheelchair, is it because he fell off a high place in the first place,

145
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:35,100
why is he even here, I want to go back to the little girl in the yellow shirts room,

146
00:14:35,100 --> 00:14:46,340
and play with farm animal toys, I want to go to this horrifying, it's horrifying, it's

147
00:14:46,340 --> 00:14:53,700
horrifying, why would they think this was appropriate to children, and I don't know,

148
00:14:53,700 --> 00:14:57,380
from an adult perspective, it's completely, it's completely unattainable, like the horses

149
00:14:57,380 --> 00:15:04,540
you got, the horses man, it's like, have you ever seen a horse in real life, they're all

150
00:15:04,540 --> 00:15:09,020
over my favorite show, My Little Pony, Friendship is Magic, but have you ever just seen a horse

151
00:15:09,020 --> 00:15:18,020
in real life, it's a majestic creature, okay, and she had like three horse toys, but what

152
00:15:18,020 --> 00:15:26,660
the reboot can't get right, is that no kid wants to go up to a high place and like, nobody

153
00:15:26,660 --> 00:15:33,380
cares about that shit, okay, everyone wants to play with farm animal toys, but who the

154
00:15:33,380 --> 00:15:38,620
heck wants to go up to a horrifying place, where you might fall and just kill yourself

155
00:15:38,620 --> 00:15:45,860
by hitting the ground too hard, you know, blatant Windows product placement here, like

156
00:15:45,860 --> 00:15:51,060
how can you be, like I remember when cartoons were just cartoons, you know, and you could

157
00:15:51,060 --> 00:15:57,900
just watch them without having a freaking Windows ad play on your screen every ten seconds,

158
00:15:57,900 --> 00:16:06,820
and all of a sudden you got to integrate Windows to kid and Windows Phone and playing Minecraft,

159
00:16:06,820 --> 00:16:15,100
Jesus Christ, this is some of the worst content I've ever seen, and I don't know, I think

160
00:16:15,100 --> 00:16:20,780
it should just be taken off the air entirely, because I don't like it, like to hell with

161
00:16:20,780 --> 00:16:26,820
all the kids who like it, like they're idiots, okay, this is the worst piece of programming

162
00:16:26,820 --> 00:16:33,980
I've ever witnessed, and we should riot in the streets, and we should, we should just

163
00:16:33,980 --> 00:16:40,060
like, we should go to Congress, we should go to Congress in whatever country, or just

164
00:16:40,060 --> 00:16:45,900
go to your Congressman, go to your government, and just like, just like throw stones at them

165
00:16:45,900 --> 00:16:50,860
or something, or I don't know, like yell at them, get like a megaphone, and like try to

166
00:16:50,860 --> 00:16:55,180
scream at them, maybe they can hear you, and try to take this stuff off the air, like this

167
00:16:55,180 --> 00:17:01,400
is completely disgusting, why would they allow this to air on television, they took

168
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:07,060
a great series in the Teletubbies, and they completely ruined it, and I think that's just

169
00:17:07,060 --> 00:17:15,100
unacceptable, so yeah, thanks for watching this cartoon rant, make sure to subscribe

172
00:17:30,380 --> 00:17:35,740
like one of the worst cartoons of all time, and I don't like it, and it's not as good

173
00:17:35,740 --> 00:17:42,820
