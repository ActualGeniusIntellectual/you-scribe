Brought to you by Manscaped. Stay tuned till the end for more information.

00:07.760 --> 00:12.080
The morning of the day I got sick, I've been thinking. It's good to be in something from the

00:12.080 --> 00:19.040
ground floor. I came too late for that, I know. But lately I'm getting the feeling that I came

00:19.040 --> 00:25.920
in at the end. The best is over. The events that most of the world calls the end of an era,

00:25.920 --> 00:31.040
Gorbachev's resignation and the last lowering of the Soviet flag that flew over the Kremlin dome.

00:32.320 --> 00:40.160
On December 26, 1991, the Soviet Union dissolved, and the last great American adversary was no more.

00:40.960 --> 00:48.000
After half a century of ideological warfare, they had lost and we had won. There were no more

00:48.000 --> 00:54.080
enemies left to conquer. The not-so-distant year of 2000 felt like turning a page into the future

00:54.080 --> 00:59.360
of civilization. A better world that would no longer have to struggle with the war, disease,

00:59.360 --> 01:06.080
and economic turmoil that had encumbered the 20th century. America, the last superpower standing,

01:06.080 --> 01:12.000
would lead the rest of the world into an era of peace and prosperity. Things were supposed to be

01:12.000 --> 01:19.760
different. We should have seen the warning signs. The sinking suspicion that something about the

01:19.760 --> 01:25.760
glorious American vision wasn't quite right. In hindsight, the slow and agonizing meltdown was

01:25.760 --> 01:30.800
staring this country right in the face. Most of us simply chose to look the other way.

01:31.680 --> 01:37.200
Aberrations to the system were written off as psychos. Unfortunate lost souls who just didn't

01:37.200 --> 01:43.280
buy into the American way. I mean, after all, this place has everything you'd ever want or need.

01:43.920 --> 01:49.920
How could anyone here possibly be unhappy? To find out, we have to take a look at two of the

01:49.920 --> 02:06.560
most miserable Americans ever put to fiction. The turn of the millennium saw two of the most

02:06.560 --> 02:12.720
influential creative works in recent memory. The Sopranos and American Psycho. Works which

02:12.720 --> 02:19.360
were inextricably defined by their unforgettable protagonists. Tony Soprano and Patrick Bateman

02:19.360 --> 02:24.720
are two distinct characters, conceived by separate writers, portrayed by separate actors,

02:24.720 --> 02:31.120
and broadcast on separate mediums. It's necessary to recognize that these two fictional men were

02:31.120 --> 02:37.360
independently created because it makes their similarities all the more uncanny. They premiered

02:37.360 --> 02:44.320
just 460 days apart. They live in and around the New York City area. Both characters can be

02:44.320 --> 02:49.760
described as an anti-hero. They each possess several very admirable traits which are drowned

02:49.760 --> 02:56.480
out by their overtly despicable actions. They are both somewhat obsessed with wealth and status.

02:56.480 --> 03:02.720
They're emotionally unstable, prone to outbursts of extreme fury. Neither can properly express

03:02.720 --> 03:08.400
their emotions to others and struggle to relate to the world around them. Both are dissatisfied

03:08.400 --> 03:12.960
with their long-term romantic partner and have frequent affairs with countless mistresses.

03:13.600 --> 03:18.880
Both will listen to 80s rock music before brutally murdering someone. The long list of

03:18.880 --> 03:24.800
similarities between these two troubled characters may seem improbable but it's no coincidence.

03:24.800 --> 03:30.480
They're just two sides of the same American story. He discovered America is what he did. He was a

03:30.480 --> 03:35.840
brave Italian explorer and in this house Christopher Columbus is a hero. There is something deeply

03:35.840 --> 03:41.360
wrong with the soul of this nation and while many are quick to blame the hapless politicians of

03:41.360 --> 03:47.360
today, if you ask me, America's problems can be traced all the way back to the beginning.

03:47.360 --> 03:52.320
When Christopher Columbus first laid eyes on the native people of the American continent,

03:52.320 --> 03:57.680
he described them as the best people in the world. He was blown away by just how peaceful and

03:57.680 --> 04:04.320
harmonious their society was. Unfortunately for the Native Americans, the mysterious new visitors

04:04.320 --> 04:10.400
weren't exactly on a humanitarian mission. Just a hundred years after Columbus first set foot on

04:10.400 --> 04:16.880
the American continent, 90 percent of the native population had been wiped out. An untold number

04:16.880 --> 04:22.560
of the best people in the world were enslaved and worked to death scouring the lands for gold that

04:22.560 --> 04:28.640
never even existed. From the very beginning, the history of the United States of America has just

04:28.640 --> 04:34.800
been one never-ending gold rush. No other country in history has had its identity so profoundly

04:34.800 --> 04:40.160
shaped by the insatiable lust for wealth. As Americans, the pursuit of fortune practically

04:40.160 --> 04:46.720
defines us. It is our centuries-long obsession, one that spawned out of a millennia-long insecurity.

04:47.360 --> 04:54.160
Since the dawn of agriculture, human civilization has been divided into two inexorable groups,

04:54.160 --> 05:00.800
the rich and the poor. For most of written history, poverty was generational and perpetual.

05:00.800 --> 05:06.480
The average person was born into bondage, either as a slave, a serf, or an indentured servant.

05:07.120 --> 05:12.480
They would spend their entire existence serving the desires of the wealthy, the only people within

05:13.360 --> 05:19.440
society who had any real autonomy. For thousands of years, the barrier between the rich and poor

05:19.440 --> 05:25.440
was practically unbreakable. You were either on one side or the other and would remain there for

05:25.440 --> 05:31.040
the rest of your life. But then along came the United States of America and a revolutionary new

05:31.040 --> 05:36.320
idea. What would happen if some of the poor were allowed to cross over to the other side?

05:36.320 --> 05:42.720
In America, the thought of becoming wealthy is not just inspirational, but aspirational.

05:43.360 --> 05:48.400
It has been embedded into the very fabric of this nation through what we call the American dream.

05:48.960 --> 05:53.200
This ideal that anyone can rise through the ranks and join the rich and powerful.

05:53.920 --> 05:59.360
It's quite a compelling mantra, one that makes an even better sales pitch. And oh boy,

05:59.360 --> 06:04.960
did people buy into it. America became known far and wide as the land of opportunity.

06:04.960 --> 06:09.280
The prospect was so appealing that millions of immigrants would abandon everything they'd ever

06:09.280 --> 06:14.800
known and cross an ocean to get here. People often wonder what differentiates Americans from

06:14.800 --> 06:20.400
everyone else. To put it simply, this nation descended from a population of people who were

06:20.400 --> 06:26.000
willing to sacrifice just about anything for a chance at getting rich. And these days, it feels

06:26.000 --> 06:30.960
like that chance just keeps getting slimmer and slimmer. While there's been much debate as to

06:30.960 --> 06:36.160
whether the American dream is still achievable, few have questioned whether the pursuit of wealth

06:36.160 --> 06:46.480
in and of itself is a bridge that's even worth crossing. Many would consider Tony Soprano to be

06:46.480 --> 06:54.080
a wealthy individual. He lives in a huge house on top of a hill with a pool, owns an SUV, a yacht,

06:54.080 --> 06:58.640
eats at fancy restaurants, pays for his kids to go to expensive private schools.

06:59.280 --> 07:05.280
He is living a lifestyle that most Americans can only imagine. But beneath the lavish excess lies

07:05.280 --> 07:11.120
a deeply troubled man, one constantly wracked with guilt and regret over where all that wealth

07:11.120 --> 07:16.880
actually comes from. Americans are the consummate opportunists, and across the history of this

07:16.880 --> 07:23.200
nation, certain groups took it upon themselves to create their own opportunity. Tony Soprano is the

07:23.200 --> 07:28.640
de facto leader of the North Jersey Mafia, a collective not exactly renowned for their

07:28.640 --> 07:35.280
innocence. In the 20th century, American mobsters were as vilified as they were romanticized.

07:35.280 --> 07:41.040
They present us with an ethical gut check, testing whether our country's so-called virtues still hold

07:41.040 --> 07:47.360
up when taken to their absolute limit. It was the Italian philosopher NiccolÃ² Machiavelli who once

07:47.360 --> 07:53.360
said, the ends justify the means. A mentality that future Italian Americans would take to

07:53.360 --> 07:59.280
heart while running the country's largest criminal empire. In the Sopranos, Tony is one of its

07:59.280 --> 08:05.760
generals, with a battalion of soldiers at his disposal. And in the mob, the war is never ending.

08:06.320 --> 08:12.400
A lifetime of sin has delivered Tony a great deal of material wealth. The only problem is that he is

08:12.400 --> 08:19.360
unable to enjoy any of it. Tony is constantly tormented by a looming unease, a specter in the

08:19.360 --> 08:24.880
back of his mind that precludes him from ever resting on his laurels. Throughout the series,

08:24.880 --> 08:31.120
there is a prevailing theme of death and decay. The Mafia is portrayed as this cancerous entity

08:31.120 --> 08:36.880
that gradually sucks the life out of everything it touches. It seems like the characters can't last

08:36.880 --> 08:42.320
more than a few episodes without winding up at another funeral. At each and every one, the

08:42.320 --> 08:48.320
survivors are left to wonder whether they'll be next. Over the course of the story, it's unsettling

08:48.320 --> 08:53.760
to see how Tony's friends and family are gradually whittled down to a fraction of what they once were.

08:54.560 --> 09:00.080
Of course, the Mafia is not exactly the safest work environment, but at times it seems like the

09:00.080 --> 09:05.920
universe itself has it out for them. It's as if their very existence represents some sort of

09:05.920 --> 09:12.320
cosmic imbalance that fate itself must correct. The whole structure of the Mafia could be described

09:12.320 --> 09:17.760
as imbalanced. Many of us may envision the gangster lifestyle as being surrounded by an

09:17.760 --> 09:24.720
egalitarian band of brothers, but The Sopranos portrays a far bleaker reality. Tony presides

09:24.720 --> 09:30.480
over a rigid hierarchy kept in place by a system of bullying and intimidation. It mirrors the

09:30.480 --> 09:35.680
experience which many immigrants endured when they first entered this country. It's been nearly

09:36.000 --> 09:41.120
5,000 years since the ancient Egyptians built the first pyramids. Some would say that we haven't

09:41.120 --> 09:47.680
stopped since. You can get rich in America, but doing so requires making someone else even richer.

09:48.640 --> 09:54.160
Just like in the Mafia, the money in this country only flows one way, and that's straight to the top.

09:54.960 --> 09:58.560
Look no further than the most profitable schemes that we've put into practice.

09:59.120 --> 10:03.600
Casinos, the stock market, Powerball, religious and political fundraising,

10:04.160 --> 10:09.840
all exist simply as instruments to transfer wealth further up the pyramid by selling people the slim

10:09.840 --> 10:15.520
chance of one day getting there themselves. But for as long as America has been in business,

10:15.520 --> 10:19.840
the fastest way to get to the top of the pyramid has always been to create your own.

10:20.720 --> 10:25.360
It's no wonder why so many poor and immigrant groups in this country have often turned to

10:25.360 --> 10:30.880
organized crime. There's a good chance you'll end up dead on the street, but at least you got ever

10:30.880 --> 10:37.680
so closer to the top. As tempting as it is, however, only one person can reign as king of the

10:37.680 --> 10:44.640
mountain and collect the lion's share of the wealth. While Tony lounges in his mansion, the rest of his

10:44.640 --> 10:51.040
subordinates live far more humbly, patiently waiting for a day when that may change. Tony may

10:51.040 --> 10:56.480
have positioned himself as the apex predator, but most of the time he ends up feeling like prey.

10:57.120 --> 11:03.440
He is relentlessly hunted by enemies, rivals, and federal agents. He suffers constant paranoia that

11:03.440 --> 11:09.120
one of his crew members will double cross him. While money and status are promised to liberate us,

11:09.680 --> 11:15.200
Tony is paradoxically trapped beneath the weight of his prosperity. It turns out that standing

11:15.200 --> 11:21.600
atop the pyramid makes you a pretty big target and leaves you with not much room to run. Tony is

11:21.600 --> 11:26.720
forced to tread a very fine line where one wrong move can result in dire consequences.

11:27.520 --> 11:31.920
At times his position of power seems far more like a burden than a blessing.

11:32.480 --> 11:37.280
Tony's obligations as a made man end up deteriorating pretty much every other aspect of

11:37.280 --> 11:43.200
his life. His health, marriage, and friendships are all compromised because business always takes

11:43.200 --> 11:50.800
precedence, and in the mob there's always more work to be done. Americans have always had a

11:50.880 --> 11:56.880
complex relationship with work. No matter how cruel and degrading, backbreaking labor tends

11:56.880 --> 12:03.440
to be seen as virtuous, patriotic even. It should be no surprise why these ideals are so commonly

12:03.440 --> 12:10.480
reinforced. The whole system depends on it. In order for so many of us to bask in such excess,

12:10.480 --> 12:16.000
somebody's got to pick up the slack. Tony mentions numerous times throughout the show that he aspires

12:16.000 --> 12:26.560
to be like Hollywood actor Gary Cooper. It's a sentiment echoed by generations of working

12:26.560 --> 12:31.760
class people in this country who insist on passively grinding away through the unchanging

12:31.760 --> 12:37.360
system. We are taught to suffer in silence because there's always someone else just a little less

12:37.360 --> 12:52.480
fortunate. In many ways Tony's destiny is no different than his immigrant forefathers.

12:53.120 --> 12:58.560
He is condemned to work himself to death, generating wealth that he'll never truly reap.

12:58.640 --> 13:07.920
It's been said that money often costs too much, and for Tony Soprano, the pursuit of wealth has

13:07.920 --> 13:12.800
left him bankrupt just about everywhere else. The thing they don't tell you about the top of the

13:12.800 --> 13:18.560
pyramid is just how lonely it is when you get there. Tony's menacing stature has profoundly

13:18.560 --> 13:24.880
alienated him from everyone else in his life. His family distrusts him and his associates fear him.

13:25.440 --> 13:29.680
The few people who actually get close to him don't tend to stick around for very long.

13:30.480 --> 13:36.160
Tony may have the responsibilities of a general, but deep down he has always been an army of one.

13:45.440 --> 13:50.560
At the very beginning of the series, Tony tells his therapist about a rare moment of joy,

13:50.560 --> 13:55.600
where he encounters a family of ducks in his pool. For him, they represent everything he

13:55.600 --> 14:01.040
can't have. Innocence, bliss, and the ability to just fly away from all their problems.

14:01.680 --> 14:07.920
Then, just as quickly as they came, they left, and Tony is overcome by a deep sadness that he

14:07.920 --> 14:14.320
can't really explain. He holds on to a sliver of hope that one day they might return, but they

14:14.400 --> 14:20.560
never do. Tony, like most Americans, spends the rest of his life searching in vain for

14:20.560 --> 14:34.240
something he lost long ago. As it turns out, not everyone has to climb to the top of the pyramid.

14:34.240 --> 14:40.320
Some people are just born there. You could describe Patrick Bateman as the American Endgame,

14:40.320 --> 14:46.640
the final destination of the American Dream. He has everything anyone could want. Money,

14:46.640 --> 14:52.960
power, good looks. He towers above the pitiful working class. As a matter of fact,

14:52.960 --> 14:58.320
we hardly see him doing any work at all. In terms of what we value in this country,

14:58.320 --> 15:03.920
he's hit the jackpot. For the average Joe, his position of providence is to die for,

15:04.480 --> 15:10.640
or from Bateman's perspective, to kill for. Because beneath the flawless exterior lies a

15:10.640 --> 15:16.560
beast so hideous, it makes us question what it even means to be human. Much like the royalty

15:16.560 --> 15:22.720
of medieval times, Patrick Bateman is a product of generational wealth. He's never known anything

15:22.720 --> 15:27.680
other than a life of luxury. An ascendant trajectory laid out before him like a red

15:27.680 --> 15:34.240
carpet. From childhood estates to prep schools to Harvard to Wall Street. At every stage of life,

15:34.240 --> 15:40.240
he has occupied the highest echelon of society. America's value system tells us that Bateman

15:40.240 --> 15:46.960
should be on Pleasure Island, when in actuality, he's a castaway. When you have everything,

15:46.960 --> 15:49.680
you start to have a hard time feeling anything.

15:50.560 --> 16:01.280
In 2013, 16-year-old Ethan Couch was driving drunk along a Texas highway when he struck and

16:01.280 --> 16:06.640
killed four people. Couch belonged to an exceptionally wealthy family and would

16:06.640 --> 16:12.640
disturbingly show little to no remorse for the casualties he just inflicted. For the victims

16:12.640 --> 16:18.160
and their loved ones, it was the most traumatic moment of their lives. But for Ethan, it was just

16:18.160 --> 16:24.480
another Saturday. The legal system seemed just as flippant about the tragedy, sentencing Ethan

16:24.480 --> 16:30.800
to a mere 10 years probation. Even more outrageous than the lenient punishment was the legal argument

16:30.800 --> 16:36.560
that Ethan's dream team of expensive lawyers had made in his defense. The attorneys made the case

16:36.560 --> 16:42.080
that their client was suffering from affluenza, a medically meaningless term that was pretty much

16:42.080 --> 16:47.280
pulled out of thin air to absolve Ethan of any wrongdoing. They argued that Ethan's immense

16:47.280 --> 16:53.600
wealth had made him incapable of comprehending the consequences of his actions. Do the rich and

16:53.600 --> 16:59.520
powerful play by the same rules as the rest of us? For a country so quick to extol the value of

16:59.520 --> 17:05.440
equality, we desperately like to believe that's the case. However, the longer you live here,

17:05.440 --> 17:09.600
the more you start to realize that the wealthy are allowed to get away with just about anything.

17:10.480 --> 17:16.320
It's been said that money can't fix all your problems, but it can fix damn near most of them.

17:16.320 --> 17:21.600
Any trouble with the law can typically be smoothed over with enough attorneys at your disposal.

17:21.600 --> 17:26.560
And hell, if the price is right, you can even change the laws themselves in your favor.

17:27.200 --> 17:31.840
With the amount of influence they wield, some wealthy are free to commit atrocities beyond

17:31.840 --> 17:36.640
our worst nightmares, and they tend to get away with it, just as long as they're not affecting

17:36.640 --> 17:42.720
anyone else even higher up the pyramid. The truth is that blind justice really only applies to the

17:42.720 --> 17:49.600
invisible masses. For the illustrious wealthy, America prefers to be blind towards injustice.

17:49.600 --> 17:52.800
Perhaps that's just yet another incentive for people to get there.

17:56.080 --> 18:01.520
It's safe to say that Patrick Bateman lives a consequence-free life. When it comes to vice,

18:01.520 --> 18:07.760
he does it all. Murder, necrophilia, cannibalism, the works. And throughout all the horror,

18:07.760 --> 18:13.280
he gets no closer to being punished for any of it. By the end of the film, he's practically begging

18:13.280 --> 18:19.040
to be held accountable for his crimes, but reaches the startling conclusion that the world around him

18:19.040 --> 18:25.280
refuses to do so. Bateman is portrayed as an unreliable narrator, so there's some debate as

18:25.280 --> 18:31.440
to whether he even committed those crimes at all. But regardless, the overall point remains the same.

18:31.440 --> 18:36.000
If everything you do is inconsequential, does that also make it meaningless?

18:36.720 --> 18:40.240
Such is the crux of Patrick Bateman's nihilistic existence.

18:47.760 --> 18:52.560
Bateman and other members of the super rich are so far removed from working class people that

18:52.560 --> 18:58.240
they might as well be from a different planet. Forget empathy and remorse, Bateman seems unable

18:58.240 --> 19:04.160
to experience any emotion besides impetuous rage. Seeing him interact with others is like watching

19:04.160 --> 19:10.000
an alien attempt to mimic human behavior. There is something truly uncanny about the culture of

19:10.000 --> 19:15.840
the wealthy. Prosperity is supposed to grant us the freedom of choice, but you never know that

19:15.840 --> 19:21.360
from observing Patrick Bateman and his yuppie acquaintances. In a world without struggle,

19:21.360 --> 19:26.720
the battle for superiority has shifted to the realm of minutia. While trying to eke out the

19:26.720 --> 19:31.360
slightest edge over each other, they have been utterly consumed by their own vanity.

19:32.000 --> 19:38.240
It's beyond superficial, it's hyperficial, to the extent where nothing else matters besides whatever

19:38.240 --> 19:44.880
exterior facade each man puts on. Their entire being boils down to nothing more than a product

19:44.880 --> 19:53.920
of wretched materialism. Because I want to fit in. It is through this matter which the film presents

19:53.920 --> 19:58.960
a paradox. While each of these characters represents the epitome of self-interested

19:58.960 --> 20:04.800
individualism, that very mindset has forced them into the ultimate culture of conformity.

20:04.800 --> 20:11.040
Their so-called personal tastes have converged into a singularity, rendering each man completely

20:11.040 --> 20:19.600
interchangeable. Don't you know who I am? I'm not Davis, I'm Patrick Bateman. It is this contradiction

20:19.600 --> 20:25.200
which fuels Patrick Bateman's hysteria. His burning desire to be noticed has only made him

20:25.200 --> 20:32.640
as invisible as his victims. What are the consequences of living consequence-free?

20:33.280 --> 20:38.960
A world without punishment is a world without virtue. Wealth has historically been seen as the

20:38.960 --> 20:44.000
pathway to civility. It's a conception that has been used throughout history to justify the

20:44.000 --> 20:49.920
eradication of people and cultures from across the planet. It doesn't matter how despicably we

20:49.920 --> 20:56.640
act, as long as we deliver them from savagery. American psychos subverse this centuries-long

20:56.640 --> 21:02.560
belief. For Patrick Bateman, wealth has broken whatever barriers were standing in the way of

21:02.560 --> 21:08.560
savagery. He may spend his days in a luxury Manhattan apartment, but he might as well exist

21:08.560 --> 21:14.800
on the plains of the Serengeti. After thousands of years of progress and evolution, the apex of

21:14.800 --> 21:21.200
humanity is no less barbaric than the primal beasts from which we spawned. Is there anything

21:21.200 --> 21:27.520
that actually matters in Patrick Bateman's wicked world? Well, maybe one thing, Dorsia.

21:28.320 --> 21:30.480
What about Dorsia?

21:30.480 --> 21:38.560
A restaurant so exclusive that not even Bateman's many gifts can land him a reservation.

21:39.280 --> 21:43.520
It serves as the single defiant obstruction to everything he represents.

21:44.240 --> 21:49.280
No matter how much he has, there's always someone else just a little more fortunate.

21:49.280 --> 21:55.120
We should have gone to Dorsia. I could have gotten us a table. Americans, more so than any other

21:55.120 --> 22:01.120
group of people, tend to equate wealth with virtue. The richest of the rich often top our

22:01.120 --> 22:07.120
lists of the most respected figures. The American dream relies on maintaining the belief that these

22:07.120 --> 22:13.840
incomprehensibly huge fortunes are fully deserved. And who knows, maybe for some of them, it is.

22:13.840 --> 22:18.880
But the vast majority of the super rich are a lot closer to Patrick Bateman than the alternative,

22:19.520 --> 22:23.920
wandering through some form of existence that's as hollow as it is amoral.

22:24.640 --> 22:30.400
In this way, Bateman is the true incarnate of the American dream. There is an idea of the

22:30.400 --> 22:36.480
self-made man, some kind of abstraction. But when you peel away the suit and tie,

22:36.480 --> 22:38.400
there is simply nothing there.

22:39.360 --> 22:44.720
Both American Psycho and The Sopranos have this uncanny attribute of being almost perpetually

22:44.720 --> 22:50.080
contemporary. They're not exactly timeless, and the themes within are far from universal.

22:50.720 --> 22:55.440
Both works were designed to reflect the concerns and attitudes of the specific period in which

22:55.440 --> 23:01.440
they were released. In all likelihood, they were expected to be seen by future generations as

23:01.440 --> 23:06.160
products of their time. But they're not exactly timeless, and the themes within are far from

23:06.800 --> 23:13.520
So if that was the case, why did they feel so much like products of our time?

23:14.240 --> 23:18.720
If you look back at every movie and TV show released around the turn of the millennium,

23:18.720 --> 23:23.280
you'd be hard-pressed to find any that have remained as culturally relevant as The Sopranos

23:23.280 --> 23:28.880
and American Psycho. There's even an argument to be made that these pieces of media are more

23:28.880 --> 23:34.880
popular today than when they first aired. There are many interpretations for why that's the case,

23:34.960 --> 23:40.160
but in my humble opinion, we find them so compelling because as time marches on,

23:40.160 --> 23:44.720
they feel less and less like fiction. It seems that whatever they were warning us

23:44.720 --> 23:47.680
about is coming more and more true with each passing day.

23:47.680 --> 23:51.440
Think on the History Channel the other night and the American Revolution.

23:51.440 --> 23:54.640
You know we're the only country in the world where the pursuit of happiness

23:54.640 --> 23:58.400
is guaranteed in writing? Where's my happiness then?

23:58.400 --> 24:00.320
It's the pursuit that's guaranteed.

24:02.960 --> 24:08.640
But for as prophetic as these two works may appear, they aren't exactly unprecedented.

24:08.640 --> 24:14.320
We've seen this story before and we know how it ends. To find out what lies ahead of us in the

24:14.320 --> 24:20.800
Roaring Twenties, all we have to do is take a look back to a writer by the name of F. Scott Fitzgerald.

24:23.600 --> 24:29.520
You could say he had America in his very blood. He was named after his most famous relative,

24:29.520 --> 24:36.960
Francis Scott Key, the writer of America's national anthem. For Fitzgerald, the story of America was

24:36.960 --> 24:42.080
practically inseparable from his identity and it would soon become part of his destiny.

24:42.640 --> 24:48.560
It all started when he met his first love, a wealthy debutante named Ginevra King. Although

24:48.560 --> 24:54.000
they shared a deep affection, this American love story would meet a bitter and unromantic end.

24:54.560 --> 25:00.160
Fitzgerald's courtship would be rejected by Ginevra's family, who deemed him too poor to be

25:00.160 --> 25:05.840
worthy of their daughter's hand. The young writer was devastated, but the heartbreak would ultimately

25:05.840 --> 25:12.720
turn him into the literary master he was meant to become. In 1919, Fitzgerald moved to New York

25:12.720 --> 25:18.320
City where he desperately tried to sell his work. At times, his situation was so bleak that he

25:18.320 --> 25:24.880
seriously contemplated ending it all, but when the year turned over to 1920, he finally caught a break.

25:28.960 --> 25:34.640
A publisher had agreed to distribute his debut novel, This Side of Paradise, which would quickly

25:34.640 --> 25:40.160
become a bestseller. All of a sudden, Fitzgerald found himself in what he thought was his own

25:40.160 --> 25:46.160
version of paradise. He'd struck it rich in what was arguably the best time in history to be rich.

25:46.800 --> 25:52.240
The U.S. was in the midst of the Jazz Age, a period characterized by unparalleled

25:52.240 --> 25:58.960
extravagance and hedonism among high society. In an era of so-called prohibition, the wealthy

25:58.960 --> 26:03.040
would unleash never-before-seen levels of drunkenness, indulgence, and lust.

26:03.840 --> 26:09.760
For the first time in his life, Fitzgerald was invited to the party. He found a new sweetheart,

26:09.760 --> 26:15.360
a southern belle named Zelda, who finally agreed to marry him after his financial success.

26:16.000 --> 26:21.600
He moved in to an enormous mansion on Long Island, surrounding himself with opulence that rivaled

26:21.600 --> 26:27.760
kings of old. At last, he had finally infiltrated the coveted sphere which had eluded him for so

26:27.760 --> 26:31.920
long, but it didn't take long for him to realize that it was no paradise.

26:34.880 --> 26:38.640
After becoming truly immersed in the lifestyle of the rich and famous,

26:38.640 --> 26:44.240
Fitzgerald was overcome by a profound disappointment. His admiration of the wealthy

26:44.240 --> 26:49.920
quickly turned to repulsion. He found that no matter how many lavish parties he attended,

26:49.920 --> 26:56.480
he simply didn't fit in with his affluent peers. Deep down, he still harbored the smoldering hatred

26:56.480 --> 27:02.880
of a peasant, which he could never truly overcome. It was a soul-crushing epiphany,

27:02.880 --> 27:06.800
one that armed him with the wisdom he needed to start writing his magnum opus.

27:07.920 --> 27:13.520
Then in 25, Fitzgerald released this, The Great Gatsby, his most acclaimed novel. A

27:13.520 --> 27:18.320
book so overassigned, most high school students probably don't pay attention to the themes.

27:18.320 --> 27:22.720
But they should pay attention, because it's not just a critique of America's class system and

27:22.720 --> 27:27.520
the futility of desire. It's also a personal statement about the author's own struggle

27:27.520 --> 27:33.760
for fulfillment in an increasingly materialistic society. There's a psychological condition known

27:33.760 --> 27:42.240
as alexithymia, common in certain personalities. The individual craves almost ceaseless action,

27:42.240 --> 27:49.440
which enables them to avoid acknowledging the abhorrent things they do. We spend a lot of

27:49.440 --> 27:54.720
time imagining how life could be if we were filthy rich, but what if you actually were?

27:55.360 --> 28:00.880
What would happen if you somehow successfully crossed over to the other side? Well, the

28:00.880 --> 28:08.160
character of Jay Gatsby did just that, and was not necessarily better off because of it. At its core,

28:08.160 --> 28:14.400
The Great Gatsby seeks to ask one very simple question. What does wealth actually give us?

28:15.120 --> 28:21.920
At face value, it seems obvious. Anything we could ever want. But beware. You'd be surprised

28:21.920 --> 28:26.960
just how quickly that list of wants runs out. Sure, you could pay off your debts,

28:26.960 --> 28:31.440
travel the world, and buy the fanciest house, car, and clothing, but then what?

28:32.160 --> 28:38.320
In consumer society, money is everything. We are taught to view it as this universal cure to

28:38.320 --> 28:43.760
whatever ailment we may be suffering. Most Americans spend their whole lives believing this,

28:43.760 --> 28:48.320
because they will never have enough wealth to disprove it. As it turns out,

28:48.320 --> 28:52.480
no matter how much you have, there are certain things that money can't buy.

28:53.920 --> 29:00.000
Jay Gatsby has been described as having more money than God. His fortune is so exorbitant

29:00.000 --> 29:05.520
that he never wears the same shirt twice. Gatsby's wealth is practically unlimited,

29:05.520 --> 29:11.600
but it's still not quite enough to satisfy his ultimate desire. Across the bay from his estate

29:11.600 --> 29:18.240
lies a green light attached to the dock of Daisy Fay. For a man whose money has bought him nearly

29:18.240 --> 29:24.800
everything else, she is his final frontier. He is not as much in love with her as he is with

29:24.800 --> 29:31.920
the concept of wealth itself. Her voice is full of money. But alas,

29:31.920 --> 29:37.200
in a story that mirrored the author's very own heartbreak, this romance was never meant to be.

29:37.200 --> 29:45.760
Despite his immense wealth, Gatsby had run into the very same barrier that we thought we

29:45.760 --> 29:52.000
vanquished long ago. The Great Gatsby highlights a new distinction which had been sparsely considered

29:52.000 --> 29:58.240
at that point in American society. The line between new money and old money. Even though

29:58.240 --> 30:03.920
he lives in one of the same enormous mansions overlooking the same Long Island bay, the culture

30:03.920 --> 30:10.800
of high society still sees Gatsby as an imposter. He may have more money than God, but he didn't

30:10.800 --> 30:18.320
always. Much like Tony Soprano, Gatsby is descended from immigrants. While it's not explicitly stated

30:18.320 --> 30:23.520
how he amassed his fortune, it is heavily implied that it comes from organized crime,

30:24.080 --> 30:30.400
which notoriously originated during the Prohibition era. However, wealthy society is no

30:30.400 --> 30:37.040
stranger to exploitation. It's not the source of Gatsby's money that's the problem, more so that

30:37.040 --> 30:43.840
he wasn't outright born with it. Gatsby is new money. He was poor at one point in his life.

30:44.640 --> 30:49.520
This immutable characteristic has branded him as an outsider to the rest of the super-rich.

30:50.240 --> 30:54.320
They'll attend his parties, but they'll never truly accept him as one of their own.

30:55.120 --> 30:59.600
It's the defining attribute separating Gatsby from the story's antagonist,

30:59.600 --> 31:06.400
Tom Buchanan, the one man standing between he and Daisy. Much like Patrick Bayman,

31:06.400 --> 31:12.880
Tom inherited his life of luxury. He is abrasive, foul-tempered, and a generally detestable

31:12.880 --> 31:19.680
individual. By all measures, Gatsby would make a far better husband for Daisy, but therein lies the

31:19.680 --> 31:25.600
tragedy of the novel. In the realm of the rich and powerful, the quality of Gatsby's character

31:25.600 --> 31:31.600
has been rendered irrelevant. America's class divide is ultimately too much for romance to

31:31.600 --> 31:38.960
overcome. Daisy, like Tom, is old money. And at the end of the day, that's the only thing that

31:38.960 --> 31:46.080
matters. Regardless of how far he came, Gatsby never even stood a chance. But even though his

31:46.080 --> 31:51.920
dream was doomed from the beginning, he never stopped believing it. He kept on pursuing his

31:51.920 --> 31:58.000
fairy tale, convincing himself that everything he wanted was just beyond the horizon. He hadn't

31:58.000 --> 32:06.480
realized that the party was over. In the months after publication, The Great Gatsby would go on

32:06.480 --> 32:12.240
to be a commercial failure. F. Scott Fitzgerald suspected that most readers and critics didn't

32:12.240 --> 32:18.640
even understand what the book was about. In a correspondence with his editor in April of 1925,

32:18.640 --> 32:24.240
Fitzgerald could see the writing on the wall. He eerily signs off on his letter with the words,

32:24.240 --> 32:53.920
yours in Great Depression. Four years later,

32:54.240 --> 32:59.360
America's age of indulgence was brought to a screeching halt by the worst economic collapse

32:59.360 --> 33:05.520
in our nation's history. All across the land, the unsuspecting poor were punished for the sins of

33:05.520 --> 33:13.360
the wealthy. As the United States spiraled further and further downward, so too did Fitzgerald. His

33:13.360 --> 33:19.680
once whimsical relationship with Zelda had turned rotten. Following a 1929 incident in which he

33:19.680 --> 33:25.680
tried to force their vehicle off a cliff, she was diagnosed with schizophrenia and institutionalized.

33:26.320 --> 33:31.760
Fitzgerald continued to work on his next novel, but his persistent alcoholism and lack of

33:31.760 --> 33:37.920
motivation delayed the project until long after he was out of the spotlight. In an era of extreme

33:37.920 --> 33:44.160
poverty and destitution, America was no longer interested in reading about the excess of the jazz

33:44.160 --> 33:50.640
age and Fitzgerald's works began to slip into obscurity. By the mid-30s, he was earning less

33:50.640 --> 33:56.480
than a hundred dollars per year off all his books and had to once again settle for being a nobody.

33:57.200 --> 34:02.240
Fitzgerald came to view himself as a failure, spending the rest of his life drinking away the

34:02.240 --> 34:09.760
pain. The excessive alcohol began to take a severe toll on his health and in 1940 he dropped dead of

34:09.760 --> 34:15.680
a heart attack at the age of 44. In an affair that paralleled the end of the Great Gatsby,

34:16.320 --> 34:18.400
hardly anyone attended his funeral.

34:27.120 --> 34:31.920
It was just a few years later when the Great Gatsby was selected as one of the works distributed

34:31.920 --> 34:38.240
to American soldiers serving abroad in World War II. Its newfound popularity sparked a critical

34:38.240 --> 34:44.320
reassessment of Fitzgerald's career. In the following decades, his 1925 entry would go on

34:44.320 --> 34:50.160
to be appreciated as a masterpiece. Today it stands as one of the most agreed upon candidates

34:50.160 --> 34:55.840
for the title of Great American Novel. The struggle between new and old money has stuck

34:55.840 --> 35:01.520
around as an enduring archetype in fiction. Its legacy has been carried on by modern day

35:01.520 --> 35:07.600
characters like Tony Soprano and Patrick Bayman. It may not be possible to concisely explain what

35:07.600 --> 35:14.240
exactly is wrong with America, but whatever it may be, these guys surely embody it. There's

35:14.240 --> 35:19.120
something to be said about how these three unique characters from vastly different backgrounds are

35:19.120 --> 35:25.120
all chasing the same thing. Dorsia, the ducks, the green light at the end of Daisy's Dock.

35:25.760 --> 35:28.880
They each represent the supreme American fantasy.

35:28.880 --> 35:41.600
In this country, we want the unobtainable. Before the United States, the world was run on bondage,

35:41.600 --> 35:46.320
until somewhere along the way we figured out that you can make people work just a little bit harder

35:46.320 --> 35:52.320
by convincing them that the freedom they desire is sitting just out of reach. Is it really a fantasy

35:52.320 --> 35:59.040
we follow or a delusion? To be fair, you tend to be a bit delusional when you've gone psycho.

35:59.760 --> 36:05.120
Whether or not you want to believe it, the party's over for America. We are experiencing the

36:05.120 --> 36:11.840
downfall of a once extravagant empire. Perhaps all this time we weren't chasing a dream, but running

36:11.840 --> 36:18.160
from destiny. Regardless, the reality of our situation won't matter. It never has, really.

36:18.800 --> 36:22.640
Tomorrow we will run faster, stretch out our arms further.

36:22.640 --> 36:38.000
We beat on, boats against the current, borne back ceaselessly into the past.

36:48.160 --> 36:59.360
I live in a dilapidated shack on a mosquito-infested swamp between two pit bull breeders.

36:59.360 --> 37:06.560
My name is M.Plemon. I'm 24 years old. I believe in taking care of myself, especially below the belt.

37:07.200 --> 37:13.600
In the morning, I open up my Manscaped Performance Package 4.0 and start charging the Lawnmower 4.0

37:13.600 --> 37:20.080
Body Trimmer while I do my crunches. I can do a dozen now. Once it's fully charged, I take the

37:20.080 --> 37:25.840
Lawnmower 4.0 into the shower and manicure my pubic region for 90 minutes until I exhaust the

37:25.840 --> 37:32.400
power supply. I then apply the Crop Preserver Ball Deodorant to trap and eliminate any foul stench

37:32.400 --> 37:38.560
being exuded by my scrotum. I immediately follow that with the Crop Reviver Ball Toner Spray which

37:38.560 --> 37:44.640
contains aloe vera so as to not dry your skin out and make you look older. I finish the rest of my

37:44.640 --> 37:50.000
routine with the Weed Whacker Wireless Nose and Ear Trimmer with built-in SkinSafe technology

37:50.000 --> 37:55.600
to reduce the chances of nicks and cuts. There is an idea of the perfect YouTube ad,

37:56.160 --> 38:02.800
some kind of abstraction, but there is no real pitch, only theatrics. And although I can hide

38:02.800 --> 38:07.600
my hatred of marketing and you can see me with the products I'm being paid to sell,

38:07.600 --> 38:11.200
and maybe you can sense that I can lead you towards a pretty good deal,

38:11.840 --> 38:17.680
it is simply not here. It's down there in the description.

I say New Yorkers can be demanding.

38:41.120 --> 38:45.600
But if an expectation that things be done quickly and to a certain level of perfection is demanding,

38:46.960 --> 38:51.120
well then yeah we're demanding. You can't drive it parking!
