Brought to you by Manscaped. Stay tuned till the end for more information.

2
00:00:07,760 --> 00:00:12,080
The morning of the day I got sick, I've been thinking. It's good to be in something from the

3
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:19,040
ground floor. I came too late for that, I know. But lately I'm getting the feeling that I came

4
00:00:19,040 --> 00:00:25,920
in at the end. The best is over. The events that most of the world calls the end of an era,

5
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:31,040
Gorbachev's resignation and the last lowering of the Soviet flag that flew over the Kremlin dome.

6
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:40,160
On December 26, 1991, the Soviet Union dissolved, and the last great American adversary was no more.

7
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:48,000
After half a century of ideological warfare, they had lost and we had won. There were no more

8
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:54,080
enemies left to conquer. The not-so-distant year of 2000 felt like turning a page into the future

9
00:00:54,080 --> 00:00:59,360
of civilization. A better world that would no longer have to struggle with the war, disease,

10
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:06,080
and economic turmoil that had encumbered the 20th century. America, the last superpower standing,

11
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:12,000
would lead the rest of the world into an era of peace and prosperity. Things were supposed to be

12
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:19,760
different. We should have seen the warning signs. The sinking suspicion that something about the

13
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:25,760
glorious American vision wasn't quite right. In hindsight, the slow and agonizing meltdown was

14
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:30,800
staring this country right in the face. Most of us simply chose to look the other way.

15
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:37,200
Aberrations to the system were written off as psychos. Unfortunate lost souls who just didn't

16
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:43,280
buy into the American way. I mean, after all, this place has everything you'd ever want or need.

17
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:49,920
How could anyone here possibly be unhappy? To find out, we have to take a look at two of the

18
00:01:49,920 --> 00:02:06,560
most miserable Americans ever put to fiction. The turn of the millennium saw two of the most

19
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:12,720
influential creative works in recent memory. The Sopranos and American Psycho. Works which

20
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:19,360
were inextricably defined by their unforgettable protagonists. Tony Soprano and Patrick Bateman

21
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:24,720
are two distinct characters, conceived by separate writers, portrayed by separate actors,

22
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:31,120
and broadcast on separate mediums. It's necessary to recognize that these two fictional men were

23
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:37,360
independently created because it makes their similarities all the more uncanny. They premiered

24
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:44,320
just 460 days apart. They live in and around the New York City area. Both characters can be

25
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:49,760
described as an anti-hero. They each possess several very admirable traits which are drowned

26
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:56,480
out by their overtly despicable actions. They are both somewhat obsessed with wealth and status.

27
00:02:56,480 --> 00:03:02,720
They're emotionally unstable, prone to outbursts of extreme fury. Neither can properly express

28
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:08,400
their emotions to others and struggle to relate to the world around them. Both are dissatisfied

29
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:12,960
with their long-term romantic partner and have frequent affairs with countless mistresses.

30
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:18,880
Both will listen to 80s rock music before brutally murdering someone. The long list of

31
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:24,800
similarities between these two troubled characters may seem improbable but it's no coincidence.

32
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:30,480
They're just two sides of the same American story. He discovered America is what he did. He was a

33
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:35,840
brave Italian explorer and in this house Christopher Columbus is a hero. There is something deeply

34
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:41,360
wrong with the soul of this nation and while many are quick to blame the hapless politicians of

35
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:47,360
today, if you ask me, America's problems can be traced all the way back to the beginning.

36
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:52,320
When Christopher Columbus first laid eyes on the native people of the American continent,

37
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:57,680
he described them as the best people in the world. He was blown away by just how peaceful and

38
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:04,320
harmonious their society was. Unfortunately for the Native Americans, the mysterious new visitors

39
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:10,400
weren't exactly on a humanitarian mission. Just a hundred years after Columbus first set foot on

40
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:16,880
the American continent, 90 percent of the native population had been wiped out. An untold number

41
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:22,560
of the best people in the world were enslaved and worked to death scouring the lands for gold that

42
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:28,640
never even existed. From the very beginning, the history of the United States of America has just

43
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:34,800
been one never-ending gold rush. No other country in history has had its identity so profoundly

44
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:40,160
shaped by the insatiable lust for wealth. As Americans, the pursuit of fortune practically

45
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:46,720
defines us. It is our centuries-long obsession, one that spawned out of a millennia-long insecurity.

46
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:54,160
Since the dawn of agriculture, human civilization has been divided into two inexorable groups,

47
00:04:54,160 --> 00:05:00,800
the rich and the poor. For most of written history, poverty was generational and perpetual.

48
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:06,480
The average person was born into bondage, either as a slave, a serf, or an indentured servant.

49
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:12,480
They would spend their entire existence serving the desires of the wealthy, the only people within

50
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:19,440
society who had any real autonomy. For thousands of years, the barrier between the rich and poor

51
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:25,440
was practically unbreakable. You were either on one side or the other and would remain there for

52
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:31,040
the rest of your life. But then along came the United States of America and a revolutionary new

53
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:36,320
idea. What would happen if some of the poor were allowed to cross over to the other side?

54
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:42,720
In America, the thought of becoming wealthy is not just inspirational, but aspirational.

55
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:48,400
It has been embedded into the very fabric of this nation through what we call the American dream.

56
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:53,200
This ideal that anyone can rise through the ranks and join the rich and powerful.

57
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:59,360
It's quite a compelling mantra, one that makes an even better sales pitch. And oh boy,

58
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:04,960
did people buy into it. America became known far and wide as the land of opportunity.

59
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:09,280
The prospect was so appealing that millions of immigrants would abandon everything they'd ever

60
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:14,800
known and cross an ocean to get here. People often wonder what differentiates Americans from

61
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:20,400
everyone else. To put it simply, this nation descended from a population of people who were

62
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:26,000
willing to sacrifice just about anything for a chance at getting rich. And these days, it feels

63
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:30,960
like that chance just keeps getting slimmer and slimmer. While there's been much debate as to

64
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:36,160
whether the American dream is still achievable, few have questioned whether the pursuit of wealth

65
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:46,480
in and of itself is a bridge that's even worth crossing. Many would consider Tony Soprano to be

66
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:54,080
a wealthy individual. He lives in a huge house on top of a hill with a pool, owns an SUV, a yacht,

67
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:58,640
eats at fancy restaurants, pays for his kids to go to expensive private schools.

68
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:05,280
He is living a lifestyle that most Americans can only imagine. But beneath the lavish excess lies

69
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:11,120
a deeply troubled man, one constantly wracked with guilt and regret over where all that wealth

70
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:16,880
actually comes from. Americans are the consummate opportunists, and across the history of this

71
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:23,200
nation, certain groups took it upon themselves to create their own opportunity. Tony Soprano is the

72
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:28,640
de facto leader of the North Jersey Mafia, a collective not exactly renowned for their

73
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:35,280
innocence. In the 20th century, American mobsters were as vilified as they were romanticized.

74
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:41,040
They present us with an ethical gut check, testing whether our country's so-called virtues still hold

75
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:47,360
up when taken to their absolute limit. It was the Italian philosopher NiccolÃ² Machiavelli who once

76
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:53,360
said, the ends justify the means. A mentality that future Italian Americans would take to

77
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:59,280
heart while running the country's largest criminal empire. In the Sopranos, Tony is one of its

78
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:05,760
generals, with a battalion of soldiers at his disposal. And in the mob, the war is never ending.

79
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:12,400
A lifetime of sin has delivered Tony a great deal of material wealth. The only problem is that he is

80
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:19,360
unable to enjoy any of it. Tony is constantly tormented by a looming unease, a specter in the

81
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:24,880
back of his mind that precludes him from ever resting on his laurels. Throughout the series,

82
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:31,120
there is a prevailing theme of death and decay. The Mafia is portrayed as this cancerous entity

83
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:36,880
that gradually sucks the life out of everything it touches. It seems like the characters can't last

84
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:42,320
more than a few episodes without winding up at another funeral. At each and every one, the

85
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:48,320
survivors are left to wonder whether they'll be next. Over the course of the story, it's unsettling

86
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:53,760
to see how Tony's friends and family are gradually whittled down to a fraction of what they once were.

87
00:08:54,560 --> 00:09:00,080
Of course, the Mafia is not exactly the safest work environment, but at times it seems like the

88
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:05,920
universe itself has it out for them. It's as if their very existence represents some sort of

89
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:12,320
cosmic imbalance that fate itself must correct. The whole structure of the Mafia could be described

90
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:17,760
as imbalanced. Many of us may envision the gangster lifestyle as being surrounded by an

91
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:24,720
egalitarian band of brothers, but The Sopranos portrays a far bleaker reality. Tony presides

92
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:30,480
over a rigid hierarchy kept in place by a system of bullying and intimidation. It mirrors the

93
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:35,680
experience which many immigrants endured when they first entered this country. It's been nearly

94
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:41,120
5,000 years since the ancient Egyptians built the first pyramids. Some would say that we haven't

95
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:47,680
stopped since. You can get rich in America, but doing so requires making someone else even richer.

96
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:54,160
Just like in the Mafia, the money in this country only flows one way, and that's straight to the top.

97
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:58,560
Look no further than the most profitable schemes that we've put into practice.

98
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:03,600
Casinos, the stock market, Powerball, religious and political fundraising,

99
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:09,840
all exist simply as instruments to transfer wealth further up the pyramid by selling people the slim

100
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:15,520
chance of one day getting there themselves. But for as long as America has been in business,

101
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:19,840
the fastest way to get to the top of the pyramid has always been to create your own.

102
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:25,360
It's no wonder why so many poor and immigrant groups in this country have often turned to

103
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:30,880
organized crime. There's a good chance you'll end up dead on the street, but at least you got ever

104
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:37,680
so closer to the top. As tempting as it is, however, only one person can reign as king of the

105
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:44,640
mountain and collect the lion's share of the wealth. While Tony lounges in his mansion, the rest of his

106
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:51,040
subordinates live far more humbly, patiently waiting for a day when that may change. Tony may

107
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:56,480
have positioned himself as the apex predator, but most of the time he ends up feeling like prey.

108
00:10:57,120 --> 00:11:03,440
He is relentlessly hunted by enemies, rivals, and federal agents. He suffers constant paranoia that

109
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:09,120
one of his crew members will double cross him. While money and status are promised to liberate us,

110
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:15,200
Tony is paradoxically trapped beneath the weight of his prosperity. It turns out that standing

111
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:21,600
atop the pyramid makes you a pretty big target and leaves you with not much room to run. Tony is

112
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:26,720
forced to tread a very fine line where one wrong move can result in dire consequences.

113
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:31,920
At times his position of power seems far more like a burden than a blessing.

114
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:37,280
Tony's obligations as a made man end up deteriorating pretty much every other aspect of

115
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:43,200
his life. His health, marriage, and friendships are all compromised because business always takes

116
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:50,800
precedence, and in the mob there's always more work to be done. Americans have always had a

117
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:56,880
complex relationship with work. No matter how cruel and degrading, backbreaking labor tends

118
00:11:56,880 --> 00:12:03,440
to be seen as virtuous, patriotic even. It should be no surprise why these ideals are so commonly

119
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:10,480
reinforced. The whole system depends on it. In order for so many of us to bask in such excess,

120
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:16,000
somebody's got to pick up the slack. Tony mentions numerous times throughout the show that he aspires

121
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:26,560
to be like Hollywood actor Gary Cooper. It's a sentiment echoed by generations of working

122
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:31,760
class people in this country who insist on passively grinding away through the unchanging

123
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:37,360
system. We are taught to suffer in silence because there's always someone else just a little less

124
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:52,480
fortunate. In many ways Tony's destiny is no different than his immigrant forefathers.

125
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:58,560
He is condemned to work himself to death, generating wealth that he'll never truly reap.

126
00:12:58,640 --> 00:13:07,920
It's been said that money often costs too much, and for Tony Soprano, the pursuit of wealth has

127
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:12,800
left him bankrupt just about everywhere else. The thing they don't tell you about the top of the

128
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:18,560
pyramid is just how lonely it is when you get there. Tony's menacing stature has profoundly

129
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:24,880
alienated him from everyone else in his life. His family distrusts him and his associates fear him.

130
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:29,680
The few people who actually get close to him don't tend to stick around for very long.

131
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:36,160
Tony may have the responsibilities of a general, but deep down he has always been an army of one.

132
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:50,560
At the very beginning of the series, Tony tells his therapist about a rare moment of joy,

133
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:55,600
where he encounters a family of ducks in his pool. For him, they represent everything he

134
00:13:55,600 --> 00:14:01,040
can't have. Innocence, bliss, and the ability to just fly away from all their problems.

135
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:07,920
Then, just as quickly as they came, they left, and Tony is overcome by a deep sadness that he

136
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:14,320
can't really explain. He holds on to a sliver of hope that one day they might return, but they

137
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:20,560
never do. Tony, like most Americans, spends the rest of his life searching in vain for

138
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:34,240
something he lost long ago. As it turns out, not everyone has to climb to the top of the pyramid.

139
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:40,320
Some people are just born there. You could describe Patrick Bateman as the American Endgame,

140
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:46,640
the final destination of the American Dream. He has everything anyone could want. Money,

141
00:14:46,640 --> 00:14:52,960
power, good looks. He towers above the pitiful working class. As a matter of fact,

142
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:58,320
we hardly see him doing any work at all. In terms of what we value in this country,

143
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:03,920
he's hit the jackpot. For the average Joe, his position of providence is to die for,

144
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:10,640
or from Bateman's perspective, to kill for. Because beneath the flawless exterior lies a

145
00:15:10,640 --> 00:15:16,560
beast so hideous, it makes us question what it even means to be human. Much like the royalty

146
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:22,720
of medieval times, Patrick Bateman is a product of generational wealth. He's never known anything

147
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:27,680
other than a life of luxury. An ascendant trajectory laid out before him like a red

148
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:34,240
carpet. From childhood estates to prep schools to Harvard to Wall Street. At every stage of life,

149
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:40,240
he has occupied the highest echelon of society. America's value system tells us that Bateman

150
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:46,960
should be on Pleasure Island, when in actuality, he's a castaway. When you have everything,

151
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:49,680
you start to have a hard time feeling anything.

152
00:15:50,560 --> 00:16:01,280
In 2013, 16-year-old Ethan Couch was driving drunk along a Texas highway when he struck and

153
00:16:01,280 --> 00:16:06,640
killed four people. Couch belonged to an exceptionally wealthy family and would

154
00:16:06,640 --> 00:16:12,640
disturbingly show little to no remorse for the casualties he just inflicted. For the victims

155
00:16:12,640 --> 00:16:18,160
and their loved ones, it was the most traumatic moment of their lives. But for Ethan, it was just

156
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:24,480
another Saturday. The legal system seemed just as flippant about the tragedy, sentencing Ethan

157
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:30,800
to a mere 10 years probation. Even more outrageous than the lenient punishment was the legal argument

158
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:36,560
that Ethan's dream team of expensive lawyers had made in his defense. The attorneys made the case

159
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:42,080
that their client was suffering from affluenza, a medically meaningless term that was pretty much

160
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:47,280
pulled out of thin air to absolve Ethan of any wrongdoing. They argued that Ethan's immense

161
00:16:47,280 --> 00:16:53,600
wealth had made him incapable of comprehending the consequences of his actions. Do the rich and

162
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:59,520
powerful play by the same rules as the rest of us? For a country so quick to extol the value of

163
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:05,440
equality, we desperately like to believe that's the case. However, the longer you live here,

164
00:17:05,440 --> 00:17:09,600
the more you start to realize that the wealthy are allowed to get away with just about anything.

165
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:16,320
It's been said that money can't fix all your problems, but it can fix damn near most of them.

166
00:17:16,320 --> 00:17:21,600
Any trouble with the law can typically be smoothed over with enough attorneys at your disposal.

167
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:26,560
And hell, if the price is right, you can even change the laws themselves in your favor.

168
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:31,840
With the amount of influence they wield, some wealthy are free to commit atrocities beyond

169
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:36,640
our worst nightmares, and they tend to get away with it, just as long as they're not affecting

170
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:42,720
anyone else even higher up the pyramid. The truth is that blind justice really only applies to the

171
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:49,600
invisible masses. For the illustrious wealthy, America prefers to be blind towards injustice.

172
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:52,800
Perhaps that's just yet another incentive for people to get there.

173
00:17:56,080 --> 00:18:01,520
It's safe to say that Patrick Bateman lives a consequence-free life. When it comes to vice,

174
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:07,760
he does it all. Murder, necrophilia, cannibalism, the works. And throughout all the horror,

175
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:13,280
he gets no closer to being punished for any of it. By the end of the film, he's practically begging

176
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:19,040
to be held accountable for his crimes, but reaches the startling conclusion that the world around him

177
00:18:19,040 --> 00:18:25,280
refuses to do so. Bateman is portrayed as an unreliable narrator, so there's some debate as

178
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:31,440
to whether he even committed those crimes at all. But regardless, the overall point remains the same.

179
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:36,000
If everything you do is inconsequential, does that also make it meaningless?

180
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:40,240
Such is the crux of Patrick Bateman's nihilistic existence.

181
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:52,560
Bateman and other members of the super rich are so far removed from working class people that

182
00:18:52,560 --> 00:18:58,240
they might as well be from a different planet. Forget empathy and remorse, Bateman seems unable

183
00:18:58,240 --> 00:19:04,160
to experience any emotion besides impetuous rage. Seeing him interact with others is like watching

184
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:10,000
an alien attempt to mimic human behavior. There is something truly uncanny about the culture of

185
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:15,840
the wealthy. Prosperity is supposed to grant us the freedom of choice, but you never know that

186
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:21,360
from observing Patrick Bateman and his yuppie acquaintances. In a world without struggle,

187
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:26,720
the battle for superiority has shifted to the realm of minutia. While trying to eke out the

188
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:31,360
slightest edge over each other, they have been utterly consumed by their own vanity.

189
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:38,240
It's beyond superficial, it's hyperficial, to the extent where nothing else matters besides whatever

190
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:44,880
exterior facade each man puts on. Their entire being boils down to nothing more than a product

191
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:53,920
of wretched materialism. Because I want to fit in. It is through this matter which the film presents

192
00:19:53,920 --> 00:19:58,960
a paradox. While each of these characters represents the epitome of self-interested

193
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:04,800
individualism, that very mindset has forced them into the ultimate culture of conformity.

194
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:11,040
Their so-called personal tastes have converged into a singularity, rendering each man completely

195
00:20:11,040 --> 00:20:19,600
interchangeable. Don't you know who I am? I'm not Davis, I'm Patrick Bateman. It is this contradiction

196
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:25,200
which fuels Patrick Bateman's hysteria. His burning desire to be noticed has only made him

197
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:32,640
as invisible as his victims. What are the consequences of living consequence-free?

198
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:38,960
A world without punishment is a world without virtue. Wealth has historically been seen as the

199
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:44,000
pathway to civility. It's a conception that has been used throughout history to justify the

200
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:49,920
eradication of people and cultures from across the planet. It doesn't matter how despicably we

201
00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:56,640
act, as long as we deliver them from savagery. American psychos subverse this centuries-long

202
00:20:56,640 --> 00:21:02,560
belief. For Patrick Bateman, wealth has broken whatever barriers were standing in the way of

203
00:21:02,560 --> 00:21:08,560
savagery. He may spend his days in a luxury Manhattan apartment, but he might as well exist

204
00:21:08,560 --> 00:21:14,800
on the plains of the Serengeti. After thousands of years of progress and evolution, the apex of

205
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:21,200
humanity is no less barbaric than the primal beasts from which we spawned. Is there anything

206
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:27,520
that actually matters in Patrick Bateman's wicked world? Well, maybe one thing, Dorsia.

207
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:30,480
What about Dorsia?

208
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:38,560
A restaurant so exclusive that not even Bateman's many gifts can land him a reservation.

209
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:43,520
It serves as the single defiant obstruction to everything he represents.

210
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:49,280
No matter how much he has, there's always someone else just a little more fortunate.

211
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:55,120
We should have gone to Dorsia. I could have gotten us a table. Americans, more so than any other

212
00:21:55,120 --> 00:22:01,120
group of people, tend to equate wealth with virtue. The richest of the rich often top our

213
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:07,120
lists of the most respected figures. The American dream relies on maintaining the belief that these

214
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:13,840
incomprehensibly huge fortunes are fully deserved. And who knows, maybe for some of them, it is.

215
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:18,880
But the vast majority of the super rich are a lot closer to Patrick Bateman than the alternative,

216
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:23,920
wandering through some form of existence that's as hollow as it is amoral.

217
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:30,400
In this way, Bateman is the true incarnate of the American dream. There is an idea of the

218
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:36,480
self-made man, some kind of abstraction. But when you peel away the suit and tie,

219
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:38,400
there is simply nothing there.

220
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:44,720
Both American Psycho and The Sopranos have this uncanny attribute of being almost perpetually

221
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:50,080
contemporary. They're not exactly timeless, and the themes within are far from universal.

222
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:55,440
Both works were designed to reflect the concerns and attitudes of the specific period in which

223
00:22:55,440 --> 00:23:01,440
they were released. In all likelihood, they were expected to be seen by future generations as

224
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:06,160
products of their time. But they're not exactly timeless, and the themes within are far from

225
00:23:06,800 --> 00:23:13,520
So if that was the case, why did they feel so much like products of our time?

226
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:18,720
If you look back at every movie and TV show released around the turn of the millennium,

227
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:23,280
you'd be hard-pressed to find any that have remained as culturally relevant as The Sopranos

228
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:28,880
and American Psycho. There's even an argument to be made that these pieces of media are more

229
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:34,880
popular today than when they first aired. There are many interpretations for why that's the case,

230
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:40,160
but in my humble opinion, we find them so compelling because as time marches on,

231
00:23:40,160 --> 00:23:44,720
they feel less and less like fiction. It seems that whatever they were warning us

232
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:47,680
about is coming more and more true with each passing day.

233
00:23:47,680 --> 00:23:51,440
Think on the History Channel the other night and the American Revolution.

234
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:54,640
You know we're the only country in the world where the pursuit of happiness

235
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:58,400
is guaranteed in writing? Where's my happiness then?

236
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:00,320
It's the pursuit that's guaranteed.

237
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:08,640
But for as prophetic as these two works may appear, they aren't exactly unprecedented.

238
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:14,320
We've seen this story before and we know how it ends. To find out what lies ahead of us in the

239
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:20,800
Roaring Twenties, all we have to do is take a look back to a writer by the name of F. Scott Fitzgerald.

240
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:29,520
You could say he had America in his very blood. He was named after his most famous relative,

241
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:36,960
Francis Scott Key, the writer of America's national anthem. For Fitzgerald, the story of America was

242
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:42,080
practically inseparable from his identity and it would soon become part of his destiny.

243
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:48,560
It all started when he met his first love, a wealthy debutante named Ginevra King. Although

244
00:24:48,560 --> 00:24:54,000
they shared a deep affection, this American love story would meet a bitter and unromantic end.

245
00:24:54,560 --> 00:25:00,160
Fitzgerald's courtship would be rejected by Ginevra's family, who deemed him too poor to be

246
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:05,840
worthy of their daughter's hand. The young writer was devastated, but the heartbreak would ultimately

247
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:12,720
turn him into the literary master he was meant to become. In 1919, Fitzgerald moved to New York

248
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:18,320
City where he desperately tried to sell his work. At times, his situation was so bleak that he

249
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:24,880
seriously contemplated ending it all, but when the year turned over to 1920, he finally caught a break.

250
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:34,640
A publisher had agreed to distribute his debut novel, This Side of Paradise, which would quickly

251
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:40,160
become a bestseller. All of a sudden, Fitzgerald found himself in what he thought was his own

252
00:25:40,160 --> 00:25:46,160
version of paradise. He'd struck it rich in what was arguably the best time in history to be rich.

253
00:25:46,800 --> 00:25:52,240
The U.S. was in the midst of the Jazz Age, a period characterized by unparalleled

254
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:58,960
extravagance and hedonism among high society. In an era of so-called prohibition, the wealthy

255
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:03,040
would unleash never-before-seen levels of drunkenness, indulgence, and lust.

256
00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:09,760
For the first time in his life, Fitzgerald was invited to the party. He found a new sweetheart,

257
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:15,360
a southern belle named Zelda, who finally agreed to marry him after his financial success.

258
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:21,600
He moved in to an enormous mansion on Long Island, surrounding himself with opulence that rivaled

259
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:27,760
kings of old. At last, he had finally infiltrated the coveted sphere which had eluded him for so

260
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:31,920
long, but it didn't take long for him to realize that it was no paradise.

261
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:38,640
After becoming truly immersed in the lifestyle of the rich and famous,

262
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:44,240
Fitzgerald was overcome by a profound disappointment. His admiration of the wealthy

263
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:49,920
quickly turned to repulsion. He found that no matter how many lavish parties he attended,

264
00:26:49,920 --> 00:26:56,480
he simply didn't fit in with his affluent peers. Deep down, he still harbored the smoldering hatred

265
00:26:56,480 --> 00:27:02,880
of a peasant, which he could never truly overcome. It was a soul-crushing epiphany,

266
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:06,800
one that armed him with the wisdom he needed to start writing his magnum opus.

267
00:27:07,920 --> 00:27:13,520
Then in 25, Fitzgerald released this, The Great Gatsby, his most acclaimed novel. A

268
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:18,320
book so overassigned, most high school students probably don't pay attention to the themes.

269
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:22,720
But they should pay attention, because it's not just a critique of America's class system and

270
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:27,520
the futility of desire. It's also a personal statement about the author's own struggle

271
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:33,760
for fulfillment in an increasingly materialistic society. There's a psychological condition known

272
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:42,240
as alexithymia, common in certain personalities. The individual craves almost ceaseless action,

273
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:49,440
which enables them to avoid acknowledging the abhorrent things they do. We spend a lot of

274
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:54,720
time imagining how life could be if we were filthy rich, but what if you actually were?

275
00:27:55,360 --> 00:28:00,880
What would happen if you somehow successfully crossed over to the other side? Well, the

276
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:08,160
character of Jay Gatsby did just that, and was not necessarily better off because of it. At its core,

277
00:28:08,160 --> 00:28:14,400
The Great Gatsby seeks to ask one very simple question. What does wealth actually give us?

278
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:21,920
At face value, it seems obvious. Anything we could ever want. But beware. You'd be surprised

279
00:28:21,920 --> 00:28:26,960
just how quickly that list of wants runs out. Sure, you could pay off your debts,

280
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:31,440
travel the world, and buy the fanciest house, car, and clothing, but then what?

281
00:28:32,160 --> 00:28:38,320
In consumer society, money is everything. We are taught to view it as this universal cure to

282
00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:43,760
whatever ailment we may be suffering. Most Americans spend their whole lives believing this,

283
00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:48,320
because they will never have enough wealth to disprove it. As it turns out,

284
00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:52,480
no matter how much you have, there are certain things that money can't buy.

285
00:28:53,920 --> 00:29:00,000
Jay Gatsby has been described as having more money than God. His fortune is so exorbitant

286
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:05,520
that he never wears the same shirt twice. Gatsby's wealth is practically unlimited,

287
00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:11,600
but it's still not quite enough to satisfy his ultimate desire. Across the bay from his estate

288
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:18,240
lies a green light attached to the dock of Daisy Fay. For a man whose money has bought him nearly

289
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:24,800
everything else, she is his final frontier. He is not as much in love with her as he is with

290
00:29:24,800 --> 00:29:31,920
the concept of wealth itself. Her voice is full of money. But alas,

291
00:29:31,920 --> 00:29:37,200
in a story that mirrored the author's very own heartbreak, this romance was never meant to be.

292
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:45,760
Despite his immense wealth, Gatsby had run into the very same barrier that we thought we

293
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:52,000
vanquished long ago. The Great Gatsby highlights a new distinction which had been sparsely considered

294
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:58,240
at that point in American society. The line between new money and old money. Even though

295
00:29:58,240 --> 00:30:03,920
he lives in one of the same enormous mansions overlooking the same Long Island bay, the culture

296
00:30:03,920 --> 00:30:10,800
of high society still sees Gatsby as an imposter. He may have more money than God, but he didn't

297
00:30:10,800 --> 00:30:18,320
always. Much like Tony Soprano, Gatsby is descended from immigrants. While it's not explicitly stated

298
00:30:18,320 --> 00:30:23,520
how he amassed his fortune, it is heavily implied that it comes from organized crime,

299
00:30:24,080 --> 00:30:30,400
which notoriously originated during the Prohibition era. However, wealthy society is no

300
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:37,040
stranger to exploitation. It's not the source of Gatsby's money that's the problem, more so that

301
00:30:37,040 --> 00:30:43,840
he wasn't outright born with it. Gatsby is new money. He was poor at one point in his life.

302
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:49,520
This immutable characteristic has branded him as an outsider to the rest of the super-rich.

303
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:54,320
They'll attend his parties, but they'll never truly accept him as one of their own.

304
00:30:55,120 --> 00:30:59,600
It's the defining attribute separating Gatsby from the story's antagonist,

305
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:06,400
Tom Buchanan, the one man standing between he and Daisy. Much like Patrick Bayman,

306
00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:12,880
Tom inherited his life of luxury. He is abrasive, foul-tempered, and a generally detestable

307
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:19,680
individual. By all measures, Gatsby would make a far better husband for Daisy, but therein lies the

308
00:31:19,680 --> 00:31:25,600
tragedy of the novel. In the realm of the rich and powerful, the quality of Gatsby's character

309
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:31,600
has been rendered irrelevant. America's class divide is ultimately too much for romance to

310
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:38,960
overcome. Daisy, like Tom, is old money. And at the end of the day, that's the only thing that

311
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:46,080
matters. Regardless of how far he came, Gatsby never even stood a chance. But even though his

312
00:31:46,080 --> 00:31:51,920
dream was doomed from the beginning, he never stopped believing it. He kept on pursuing his

313
00:31:51,920 --> 00:31:58,000
fairy tale, convincing himself that everything he wanted was just beyond the horizon. He hadn't

314
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:06,480
realized that the party was over. In the months after publication, The Great Gatsby would go on

315
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:12,240
to be a commercial failure. F. Scott Fitzgerald suspected that most readers and critics didn't

316
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:18,640
even understand what the book was about. In a correspondence with his editor in April of 1925,

317
00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:24,240
Fitzgerald could see the writing on the wall. He eerily signs off on his letter with the words,

318
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:53,920
yours in Great Depression. Four years later,

319
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:59,360
America's age of indulgence was brought to a screeching halt by the worst economic collapse

320
00:32:59,360 --> 00:33:05,520
in our nation's history. All across the land, the unsuspecting poor were punished for the sins of

321
00:33:05,520 --> 00:33:13,360
the wealthy. As the United States spiraled further and further downward, so too did Fitzgerald. His

322
00:33:13,360 --> 00:33:19,680
once whimsical relationship with Zelda had turned rotten. Following a 1929 incident in which he

323
00:33:19,680 --> 00:33:25,680
tried to force their vehicle off a cliff, she was diagnosed with schizophrenia and institutionalized.

324
00:33:26,320 --> 00:33:31,760
Fitzgerald continued to work on his next novel, but his persistent alcoholism and lack of

325
00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:37,920
motivation delayed the project until long after he was out of the spotlight. In an era of extreme

326
00:33:37,920 --> 00:33:44,160
poverty and destitution, America was no longer interested in reading about the excess of the jazz

327
00:33:44,160 --> 00:33:50,640
age and Fitzgerald's works began to slip into obscurity. By the mid-30s, he was earning less

328
00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:56,480
than a hundred dollars per year off all his books and had to once again settle for being a nobody.

329
00:33:57,200 --> 00:34:02,240
Fitzgerald came to view himself as a failure, spending the rest of his life drinking away the

330
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:09,760
pain. The excessive alcohol began to take a severe toll on his health and in 1940 he dropped dead of

331
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:15,680
a heart attack at the age of 44. In an affair that paralleled the end of the Great Gatsby,

332
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:18,400
hardly anyone attended his funeral.

333
00:34:27,120 --> 00:34:31,920
It was just a few years later when the Great Gatsby was selected as one of the works distributed

334
00:34:31,920 --> 00:34:38,240
to American soldiers serving abroad in World War II. Its newfound popularity sparked a critical

335
00:34:38,240 --> 00:34:44,320
reassessment of Fitzgerald's career. In the following decades, his 1925 entry would go on

336
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:50,160
to be appreciated as a masterpiece. Today it stands as one of the most agreed upon candidates

337
00:34:50,160 --> 00:34:55,840
for the title of Great American Novel. The struggle between new and old money has stuck

338
00:34:55,840 --> 00:35:01,520
around as an enduring archetype in fiction. Its legacy has been carried on by modern day

339
00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:07,600
characters like Tony Soprano and Patrick Bayman. It may not be possible to concisely explain what

340
00:35:07,600 --> 00:35:14,240
exactly is wrong with America, but whatever it may be, these guys surely embody it. There's

341
00:35:14,240 --> 00:35:19,120
something to be said about how these three unique characters from vastly different backgrounds are

342
00:35:19,120 --> 00:35:25,120
all chasing the same thing. Dorsia, the ducks, the green light at the end of Daisy's Dock.

343
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:28,880
They each represent the supreme American fantasy.

344
00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:41,600
In this country, we want the unobtainable. Before the United States, the world was run on bondage,

345
00:35:41,600 --> 00:35:46,320
until somewhere along the way we figured out that you can make people work just a little bit harder

346
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:52,320
by convincing them that the freedom they desire is sitting just out of reach. Is it really a fantasy

347
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:59,040
we follow or a delusion? To be fair, you tend to be a bit delusional when you've gone psycho.

348
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:05,120
Whether or not you want to believe it, the party's over for America. We are experiencing the

349
00:36:05,120 --> 00:36:11,840
downfall of a once extravagant empire. Perhaps all this time we weren't chasing a dream, but running

350
00:36:11,840 --> 00:36:18,160
from destiny. Regardless, the reality of our situation won't matter. It never has, really.

351
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:22,640
Tomorrow we will run faster, stretch out our arms further.

352
00:36:22,640 --> 00:36:38,000
We beat on, boats against the current, borne back ceaselessly into the past.

353
00:36:48,160 --> 00:36:59,360
I live in a dilapidated shack on a mosquito-infested swamp between two pit bull breeders.

354
00:36:59,360 --> 00:37:06,560
My name is M.Plemon. I'm 24 years old. I believe in taking care of myself, especially below the belt.

355
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:13,600
In the morning, I open up my Manscaped Performance Package 4.0 and start charging the Lawnmower 4.0

356
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:20,080
Body Trimmer while I do my crunches. I can do a dozen now. Once it's fully charged, I take the

357
00:37:20,080 --> 00:37:25,840
Lawnmower 4.0 into the shower and manicure my pubic region for 90 minutes until I exhaust the

358
00:37:25,840 --> 00:37:32,400
power supply. I then apply the Crop Preserver Ball Deodorant to trap and eliminate any foul stench

359
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:38,560
being exuded by my scrotum. I immediately follow that with the Crop Reviver Ball Toner Spray which

360
00:37:38,560 --> 00:37:44,640
contains aloe vera so as to not dry your skin out and make you look older. I finish the rest of my

361
00:37:44,640 --> 00:37:50,000
routine with the Weed Whacker Wireless Nose and Ear Trimmer with built-in SkinSafe technology

362
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:55,600
to reduce the chances of nicks and cuts. There is an idea of the perfect YouTube ad,

363
00:37:56,160 --> 00:38:02,800
some kind of abstraction, but there is no real pitch, only theatrics. And although I can hide

364
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:07,600
my hatred of marketing and you can see me with the products I'm being paid to sell,

365
00:38:07,600 --> 00:38:11,200
and maybe you can sense that I can lead you towards a pretty good deal,

366
00:38:11,840 --> 00:38:17,680
it is simply not here. It's down there in the description.

369
00:38:29,600 --> 00:38:38,080
I say New Yorkers can be demanding.

370
00:38:41,120 --> 00:38:45,600
But if an expectation that things be done quickly and to a certain level of perfection is demanding,

371
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:51,120
well then yeah we're demanding. You can't drive it parking!

372
00:38:51,120 --> 00:38:57,520
He's a pussycat wheelie. We just have a highly developed sense of what we want out of life.

373
00:38:57,520 --> 00:39:01,520
You're flying American, right? Absolutely.

374
00:39:03,200 --> 00:39:07,360
We've flown more New Yorkers to destinations around the world than any other airline.

375
00:39:08,080 --> 00:39:10,480
And if we can keep them happy.
