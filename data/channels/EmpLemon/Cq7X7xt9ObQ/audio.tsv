7760	12080	The morning of the day I got sick, I've been thinking. It's good to be in something from the
12080	19040	ground floor. I came too late for that, I know. But lately I'm getting the feeling that I came
19040	25920	in at the end. The best is over. The events that most of the world calls the end of an era,
25920	31040	Gorbachev's resignation and the last lowering of the Soviet flag that flew over the Kremlin dome.
32320	40160	On December 26, 1991, the Soviet Union dissolved, and the last great American adversary was no more.
40960	48000	After half a century of ideological warfare, they had lost and we had won. There were no more
48000	54080	enemies left to conquer. The not-so-distant year of 2000 felt like turning a page into the future
54080	59360	of civilization. A better world that would no longer have to struggle with the war, disease,
59360	66080	and economic turmoil that had encumbered the 20th century. America, the last superpower standing,
66080	72000	would lead the rest of the world into an era of peace and prosperity. Things were supposed to be
72000	79760	different. We should have seen the warning signs. The sinking suspicion that something about the
79760	85760	glorious American vision wasn't quite right. In hindsight, the slow and agonizing meltdown was
85760	90800	staring this country right in the face. Most of us simply chose to look the other way.
91680	97200	Aberrations to the system were written off as psychos. Unfortunate lost souls who just didn't
97200	103280	buy into the American way. I mean, after all, this place has everything you'd ever want or need.
103920	109920	How could anyone here possibly be unhappy? To find out, we have to take a look at two of the
109920	126560	most miserable Americans ever put to fiction. The turn of the millennium saw two of the most
126560	132720	influential creative works in recent memory. The Sopranos and American Psycho. Works which
132720	139360	were inextricably defined by their unforgettable protagonists. Tony Soprano and Patrick Bateman
139360	144720	are two distinct characters, conceived by separate writers, portrayed by separate actors,
144720	151120	and broadcast on separate mediums. It's necessary to recognize that these two fictional men were
151120	157360	independently created because it makes their similarities all the more uncanny. They premiered
157360	164320	just 460 days apart. They live in and around the New York City area. Both characters can be
164320	169760	described as an anti-hero. They each possess several very admirable traits which are drowned
169760	176480	out by their overtly despicable actions. They are both somewhat obsessed with wealth and status.
176480	182720	They're emotionally unstable, prone to outbursts of extreme fury. Neither can properly express
182720	188400	their emotions to others and struggle to relate to the world around them. Both are dissatisfied
188400	192960	with their long-term romantic partner and have frequent affairs with countless mistresses.
193600	198880	Both will listen to 80s rock music before brutally murdering someone. The long list of
198880	204800	similarities between these two troubled characters may seem improbable but it's no coincidence.
204800	210480	They're just two sides of the same American story. He discovered America is what he did. He was a
210480	215840	brave Italian explorer and in this house Christopher Columbus is a hero. There is something deeply
215840	221360	wrong with the soul of this nation and while many are quick to blame the hapless politicians of
221360	227360	today, if you ask me, America's problems can be traced all the way back to the beginning.
227360	232320	When Christopher Columbus first laid eyes on the native people of the American continent,
232320	237680	he described them as the best people in the world. He was blown away by just how peaceful and
237680	244320	harmonious their society was. Unfortunately for the Native Americans, the mysterious new visitors
244320	250400	weren't exactly on a humanitarian mission. Just a hundred years after Columbus first set foot on
250400	256880	the American continent, 90 percent of the native population had been wiped out. An untold number
256880	262560	of the best people in the world were enslaved and worked to death scouring the lands for gold that
262560	268640	never even existed. From the very beginning, the history of the United States of America has just
268640	274800	been one never-ending gold rush. No other country in history has had its identity so profoundly
274800	280160	shaped by the insatiable lust for wealth. As Americans, the pursuit of fortune practically
280160	286720	defines us. It is our centuries-long obsession, one that spawned out of a millennia-long insecurity.
287360	294160	Since the dawn of agriculture, human civilization has been divided into two inexorable groups,
294160	300800	the rich and the poor. For most of written history, poverty was generational and perpetual.
300800	306480	The average person was born into bondage, either as a slave, a serf, or an indentured servant.
307120	312480	They would spend their entire existence serving the desires of the wealthy, the only people within
313360	319440	society who had any real autonomy. For thousands of years, the barrier between the rich and poor
319440	325440	was practically unbreakable. You were either on one side or the other and would remain there for
325440	331040	the rest of your life. But then along came the United States of America and a revolutionary new
331040	336320	idea. What would happen if some of the poor were allowed to cross over to the other side?
336320	342720	In America, the thought of becoming wealthy is not just inspirational, but aspirational.
343360	348400	It has been embedded into the very fabric of this nation through what we call the American dream.
348960	353200	This ideal that anyone can rise through the ranks and join the rich and powerful.
353920	359360	It's quite a compelling mantra, one that makes an even better sales pitch. And oh boy,
359360	364960	did people buy into it. America became known far and wide as the land of opportunity.
364960	369280	The prospect was so appealing that millions of immigrants would abandon everything they'd ever
369280	374800	known and cross an ocean to get here. People often wonder what differentiates Americans from
374800	380400	everyone else. To put it simply, this nation descended from a population of people who were
380400	386000	willing to sacrifice just about anything for a chance at getting rich. And these days, it feels
386000	390960	like that chance just keeps getting slimmer and slimmer. While there's been much debate as to
390960	396160	whether the American dream is still achievable, few have questioned whether the pursuit of wealth
396160	406480	in and of itself is a bridge that's even worth crossing. Many would consider Tony Soprano to be
406480	414080	a wealthy individual. He lives in a huge house on top of a hill with a pool, owns an SUV, a yacht,
414080	418640	eats at fancy restaurants, pays for his kids to go to expensive private schools.
419280	425280	He is living a lifestyle that most Americans can only imagine. But beneath the lavish excess lies
425280	431120	a deeply troubled man, one constantly wracked with guilt and regret over where all that wealth
431120	436880	actually comes from. Americans are the consummate opportunists, and across the history of this
436880	443200	nation, certain groups took it upon themselves to create their own opportunity. Tony Soprano is the
443200	448640	de facto leader of the North Jersey Mafia, a collective not exactly renowned for their
448640	455280	innocence. In the 20th century, American mobsters were as vilified as they were romanticized.
455280	461040	They present us with an ethical gut check, testing whether our country's so-called virtues still hold
461040	467360	up when taken to their absolute limit. It was the Italian philosopher Niccol√≤ Machiavelli who once
467360	473360	said, the ends justify the means. A mentality that future Italian Americans would take to
473360	479280	heart while running the country's largest criminal empire. In the Sopranos, Tony is one of its
479280	485760	generals, with a battalion of soldiers at his disposal. And in the mob, the war is never ending.
486320	492400	A lifetime of sin has delivered Tony a great deal of material wealth. The only problem is that he is
492400	499360	unable to enjoy any of it. Tony is constantly tormented by a looming unease, a specter in the
499360	504880	back of his mind that precludes him from ever resting on his laurels. Throughout the series,
504880	511120	there is a prevailing theme of death and decay. The Mafia is portrayed as this cancerous entity
511120	516880	that gradually sucks the life out of everything it touches. It seems like the characters can't last
516880	522320	more than a few episodes without winding up at another funeral. At each and every one, the
522320	528320	survivors are left to wonder whether they'll be next. Over the course of the story, it's unsettling
528320	533760	to see how Tony's friends and family are gradually whittled down to a fraction of what they once were.
534560	540080	Of course, the Mafia is not exactly the safest work environment, but at times it seems like the
540080	545920	universe itself has it out for them. It's as if their very existence represents some sort of
545920	552320	cosmic imbalance that fate itself must correct. The whole structure of the Mafia could be described
552320	557760	as imbalanced. Many of us may envision the gangster lifestyle as being surrounded by an
557760	564720	egalitarian band of brothers, but The Sopranos portrays a far bleaker reality. Tony presides
564720	570480	over a rigid hierarchy kept in place by a system of bullying and intimidation. It mirrors the
570480	575680	experience which many immigrants endured when they first entered this country. It's been nearly
576000	581120	5,000 years since the ancient Egyptians built the first pyramids. Some would say that we haven't
581120	587680	stopped since. You can get rich in America, but doing so requires making someone else even richer.
588640	594160	Just like in the Mafia, the money in this country only flows one way, and that's straight to the top.
594960	598560	Look no further than the most profitable schemes that we've put into practice.
599120	603600	Casinos, the stock market, Powerball, religious and political fundraising,
604160	609840	all exist simply as instruments to transfer wealth further up the pyramid by selling people the slim
609840	615520	chance of one day getting there themselves. But for as long as America has been in business,
615520	619840	the fastest way to get to the top of the pyramid has always been to create your own.
620720	625360	It's no wonder why so many poor and immigrant groups in this country have often turned to
625360	630880	organized crime. There's a good chance you'll end up dead on the street, but at least you got ever
630880	637680	so closer to the top. As tempting as it is, however, only one person can reign as king of the
637680	644640	mountain and collect the lion's share of the wealth. While Tony lounges in his mansion, the rest of his
644640	651040	subordinates live far more humbly, patiently waiting for a day when that may change. Tony may
651040	656480	have positioned himself as the apex predator, but most of the time he ends up feeling like prey.
657120	663440	He is relentlessly hunted by enemies, rivals, and federal agents. He suffers constant paranoia that
663440	669120	one of his crew members will double cross him. While money and status are promised to liberate us,
669680	675200	Tony is paradoxically trapped beneath the weight of his prosperity. It turns out that standing
675200	681600	atop the pyramid makes you a pretty big target and leaves you with not much room to run. Tony is
681600	686720	forced to tread a very fine line where one wrong move can result in dire consequences.
687520	691920	At times his position of power seems far more like a burden than a blessing.
692480	697280	Tony's obligations as a made man end up deteriorating pretty much every other aspect of
697280	703200	his life. His health, marriage, and friendships are all compromised because business always takes
703200	710800	precedence, and in the mob there's always more work to be done. Americans have always had a
710880	716880	complex relationship with work. No matter how cruel and degrading, backbreaking labor tends
716880	723440	to be seen as virtuous, patriotic even. It should be no surprise why these ideals are so commonly
723440	730480	reinforced. The whole system depends on it. In order for so many of us to bask in such excess,
730480	736000	somebody's got to pick up the slack. Tony mentions numerous times throughout the show that he aspires
736000	746560	to be like Hollywood actor Gary Cooper. It's a sentiment echoed by generations of working
746560	751760	class people in this country who insist on passively grinding away through the unchanging
751760	757360	system. We are taught to suffer in silence because there's always someone else just a little less
757360	772480	fortunate. In many ways Tony's destiny is no different than his immigrant forefathers.
773120	778560	He is condemned to work himself to death, generating wealth that he'll never truly reap.
778640	787920	It's been said that money often costs too much, and for Tony Soprano, the pursuit of wealth has
787920	792800	left him bankrupt just about everywhere else. The thing they don't tell you about the top of the
792800	798560	pyramid is just how lonely it is when you get there. Tony's menacing stature has profoundly
798560	804880	alienated him from everyone else in his life. His family distrusts him and his associates fear him.
805440	809680	The few people who actually get close to him don't tend to stick around for very long.
810480	816160	Tony may have the responsibilities of a general, but deep down he has always been an army of one.
825440	830560	At the very beginning of the series, Tony tells his therapist about a rare moment of joy,
830560	835600	where he encounters a family of ducks in his pool. For him, they represent everything he
835600	841040	can't have. Innocence, bliss, and the ability to just fly away from all their problems.
841680	847920	Then, just as quickly as they came, they left, and Tony is overcome by a deep sadness that he
847920	854320	can't really explain. He holds on to a sliver of hope that one day they might return, but they
854400	860560	never do. Tony, like most Americans, spends the rest of his life searching in vain for
860560	874240	something he lost long ago. As it turns out, not everyone has to climb to the top of the pyramid.
874240	880320	Some people are just born there. You could describe Patrick Bateman as the American Endgame,
880320	886640	the final destination of the American Dream. He has everything anyone could want. Money,
886640	892960	power, good looks. He towers above the pitiful working class. As a matter of fact,
892960	898320	we hardly see him doing any work at all. In terms of what we value in this country,
898320	903920	he's hit the jackpot. For the average Joe, his position of providence is to die for,
904480	910640	or from Bateman's perspective, to kill for. Because beneath the flawless exterior lies a
910640	916560	beast so hideous, it makes us question what it even means to be human. Much like the royalty
916560	922720	of medieval times, Patrick Bateman is a product of generational wealth. He's never known anything
922720	927680	other than a life of luxury. An ascendant trajectory laid out before him like a red
927680	934240	carpet. From childhood estates to prep schools to Harvard to Wall Street. At every stage of life,
934240	940240	he has occupied the highest echelon of society. America's value system tells us that Bateman
940240	946960	should be on Pleasure Island, when in actuality, he's a castaway. When you have everything,
946960	949680	you start to have a hard time feeling anything.
950560	961280	In 2013, 16-year-old Ethan Couch was driving drunk along a Texas highway when he struck and
961280	966640	killed four people. Couch belonged to an exceptionally wealthy family and would
966640	972640	disturbingly show little to no remorse for the casualties he just inflicted. For the victims
972640	978160	and their loved ones, it was the most traumatic moment of their lives. But for Ethan, it was just
978160	984480	another Saturday. The legal system seemed just as flippant about the tragedy, sentencing Ethan
984480	990800	to a mere 10 years probation. Even more outrageous than the lenient punishment was the legal argument
990800	996560	that Ethan's dream team of expensive lawyers had made in his defense. The attorneys made the case
996560	1002080	that their client was suffering from affluenza, a medically meaningless term that was pretty much
1002080	1007280	pulled out of thin air to absolve Ethan of any wrongdoing. They argued that Ethan's immense
1007280	1013600	wealth had made him incapable of comprehending the consequences of his actions. Do the rich and
1013600	1019520	powerful play by the same rules as the rest of us? For a country so quick to extol the value of
1019520	1025440	equality, we desperately like to believe that's the case. However, the longer you live here,
1025440	1029600	the more you start to realize that the wealthy are allowed to get away with just about anything.
1030480	1036320	It's been said that money can't fix all your problems, but it can fix damn near most of them.
1036320	1041600	Any trouble with the law can typically be smoothed over with enough attorneys at your disposal.
1041600	1046560	And hell, if the price is right, you can even change the laws themselves in your favor.
1047200	1051840	With the amount of influence they wield, some wealthy are free to commit atrocities beyond
1051840	1056640	our worst nightmares, and they tend to get away with it, just as long as they're not affecting
1056640	1062720	anyone else even higher up the pyramid. The truth is that blind justice really only applies to the
1062720	1069600	invisible masses. For the illustrious wealthy, America prefers to be blind towards injustice.
1069600	1072800	Perhaps that's just yet another incentive for people to get there.
1076080	1081520	It's safe to say that Patrick Bateman lives a consequence-free life. When it comes to vice,
1081520	1087760	he does it all. Murder, necrophilia, cannibalism, the works. And throughout all the horror,
1087760	1093280	he gets no closer to being punished for any of it. By the end of the film, he's practically begging
1093280	1099040	to be held accountable for his crimes, but reaches the startling conclusion that the world around him
1099040	1105280	refuses to do so. Bateman is portrayed as an unreliable narrator, so there's some debate as
1105280	1111440	to whether he even committed those crimes at all. But regardless, the overall point remains the same.
1111440	1116000	If everything you do is inconsequential, does that also make it meaningless?
1116720	1120240	Such is the crux of Patrick Bateman's nihilistic existence.
1127760	1132560	Bateman and other members of the super rich are so far removed from working class people that
1132560	1138240	they might as well be from a different planet. Forget empathy and remorse, Bateman seems unable
1138240	1144160	to experience any emotion besides impetuous rage. Seeing him interact with others is like watching
1144160	1150000	an alien attempt to mimic human behavior. There is something truly uncanny about the culture of
1150000	1155840	the wealthy. Prosperity is supposed to grant us the freedom of choice, but you never know that
1155840	1161360	from observing Patrick Bateman and his yuppie acquaintances. In a world without struggle,
1161360	1166720	the battle for superiority has shifted to the realm of minutia. While trying to eke out the
1166720	1171360	slightest edge over each other, they have been utterly consumed by their own vanity.
1172000	1178240	It's beyond superficial, it's hyperficial, to the extent where nothing else matters besides whatever
1178240	1184880	exterior facade each man puts on. Their entire being boils down to nothing more than a product
1184880	1193920	of wretched materialism. Because I want to fit in. It is through this matter which the film presents
1193920	1198960	a paradox. While each of these characters represents the epitome of self-interested
1198960	1204800	individualism, that very mindset has forced them into the ultimate culture of conformity.
1204800	1211040	Their so-called personal tastes have converged into a singularity, rendering each man completely
1211040	1219600	interchangeable. Don't you know who I am? I'm not Davis, I'm Patrick Bateman. It is this contradiction
1219600	1225200	which fuels Patrick Bateman's hysteria. His burning desire to be noticed has only made him
1225200	1232640	as invisible as his victims. What are the consequences of living consequence-free?
1233280	1238960	A world without punishment is a world without virtue. Wealth has historically been seen as the
1238960	1244000	pathway to civility. It's a conception that has been used throughout history to justify the
1244000	1249920	eradication of people and cultures from across the planet. It doesn't matter how despicably we
1249920	1256640	act, as long as we deliver them from savagery. American psychos subverse this centuries-long
1256640	1262560	belief. For Patrick Bateman, wealth has broken whatever barriers were standing in the way of
1262560	1268560	savagery. He may spend his days in a luxury Manhattan apartment, but he might as well exist
1268560	1274800	on the plains of the Serengeti. After thousands of years of progress and evolution, the apex of
1274800	1281200	humanity is no less barbaric than the primal beasts from which we spawned. Is there anything
1281200	1287520	that actually matters in Patrick Bateman's wicked world? Well, maybe one thing, Dorsia.
1288320	1290480	What about Dorsia?
1290480	1298560	A restaurant so exclusive that not even Bateman's many gifts can land him a reservation.
1299280	1303520	It serves as the single defiant obstruction to everything he represents.
1304240	1309280	No matter how much he has, there's always someone else just a little more fortunate.
1309280	1315120	We should have gone to Dorsia. I could have gotten us a table. Americans, more so than any other
1315120	1321120	group of people, tend to equate wealth with virtue. The richest of the rich often top our
1321120	1327120	lists of the most respected figures. The American dream relies on maintaining the belief that these
1327120	1333840	incomprehensibly huge fortunes are fully deserved. And who knows, maybe for some of them, it is.
1333840	1338880	But the vast majority of the super rich are a lot closer to Patrick Bateman than the alternative,
1339520	1343920	wandering through some form of existence that's as hollow as it is amoral.
1344640	1350400	In this way, Bateman is the true incarnate of the American dream. There is an idea of the
1350400	1356480	self-made man, some kind of abstraction. But when you peel away the suit and tie,
1356480	1358400	there is simply nothing there.
1359360	1364720	Both American Psycho and The Sopranos have this uncanny attribute of being almost perpetually
1364720	1370080	contemporary. They're not exactly timeless, and the themes within are far from universal.
1370720	1375440	Both works were designed to reflect the concerns and attitudes of the specific period in which
1375440	1381440	they were released. In all likelihood, they were expected to be seen by future generations as
1381440	1386160	products of their time. But they're not exactly timeless, and the themes within are far from
1386800	1393520	So if that was the case, why did they feel so much like products of our time?
1394240	1398720	If you look back at every movie and TV show released around the turn of the millennium,
1398720	1403280	you'd be hard-pressed to find any that have remained as culturally relevant as The Sopranos
1403280	1408880	and American Psycho. There's even an argument to be made that these pieces of media are more
1408880	1414880	popular today than when they first aired. There are many interpretations for why that's the case,
1414960	1420160	but in my humble opinion, we find them so compelling because as time marches on,
1420160	1424720	they feel less and less like fiction. It seems that whatever they were warning us
1424720	1427680	about is coming more and more true with each passing day.
1427680	1431440	Think on the History Channel the other night and the American Revolution.
1431440	1434640	You know we're the only country in the world where the pursuit of happiness
1434640	1438400	is guaranteed in writing? Where's my happiness then?
1438400	1440320	It's the pursuit that's guaranteed.
1442960	1448640	But for as prophetic as these two works may appear, they aren't exactly unprecedented.
1448640	1454320	We've seen this story before and we know how it ends. To find out what lies ahead of us in the
1454320	1460800	Roaring Twenties, all we have to do is take a look back to a writer by the name of F. Scott Fitzgerald.
1463600	1469520	You could say he had America in his very blood. He was named after his most famous relative,
1469520	1476960	Francis Scott Key, the writer of America's national anthem. For Fitzgerald, the story of America was
1476960	1482080	practically inseparable from his identity and it would soon become part of his destiny.
1482640	1488560	It all started when he met his first love, a wealthy debutante named Ginevra King. Although
1488560	1494000	they shared a deep affection, this American love story would meet a bitter and unromantic end.
1494560	1500160	Fitzgerald's courtship would be rejected by Ginevra's family, who deemed him too poor to be
1500160	1505840	worthy of their daughter's hand. The young writer was devastated, but the heartbreak would ultimately
1505840	1512720	turn him into the literary master he was meant to become. In 1919, Fitzgerald moved to New York
1512720	1518320	City where he desperately tried to sell his work. At times, his situation was so bleak that he
1518320	1524880	seriously contemplated ending it all, but when the year turned over to 1920, he finally caught a break.
1528960	1534640	A publisher had agreed to distribute his debut novel, This Side of Paradise, which would quickly
1534640	1540160	become a bestseller. All of a sudden, Fitzgerald found himself in what he thought was his own
1540160	1546160	version of paradise. He'd struck it rich in what was arguably the best time in history to be rich.
1546800	1552240	The U.S. was in the midst of the Jazz Age, a period characterized by unparalleled
1552240	1558960	extravagance and hedonism among high society. In an era of so-called prohibition, the wealthy
1558960	1563040	would unleash never-before-seen levels of drunkenness, indulgence, and lust.
1563840	1569760	For the first time in his life, Fitzgerald was invited to the party. He found a new sweetheart,
1569760	1575360	a southern belle named Zelda, who finally agreed to marry him after his financial success.
1576000	1581600	He moved in to an enormous mansion on Long Island, surrounding himself with opulence that rivaled
1581600	1587760	kings of old. At last, he had finally infiltrated the coveted sphere which had eluded him for so
1587760	1591920	long, but it didn't take long for him to realize that it was no paradise.
1594880	1598640	After becoming truly immersed in the lifestyle of the rich and famous,
1598640	1604240	Fitzgerald was overcome by a profound disappointment. His admiration of the wealthy
1604240	1609920	quickly turned to repulsion. He found that no matter how many lavish parties he attended,
1609920	1616480	he simply didn't fit in with his affluent peers. Deep down, he still harbored the smoldering hatred
1616480	1622880	of a peasant, which he could never truly overcome. It was a soul-crushing epiphany,
1622880	1626800	one that armed him with the wisdom he needed to start writing his magnum opus.
1627920	1633520	Then in 25, Fitzgerald released this, The Great Gatsby, his most acclaimed novel. A
1633520	1638320	book so overassigned, most high school students probably don't pay attention to the themes.
1638320	1642720	But they should pay attention, because it's not just a critique of America's class system and
1642720	1647520	the futility of desire. It's also a personal statement about the author's own struggle
1647520	1653760	for fulfillment in an increasingly materialistic society. There's a psychological condition known
1653760	1662240	as alexithymia, common in certain personalities. The individual craves almost ceaseless action,
1662240	1669440	which enables them to avoid acknowledging the abhorrent things they do. We spend a lot of
1669440	1674720	time imagining how life could be if we were filthy rich, but what if you actually were?
1675360	1680880	What would happen if you somehow successfully crossed over to the other side? Well, the
1680880	1688160	character of Jay Gatsby did just that, and was not necessarily better off because of it. At its core,
1688160	1694400	The Great Gatsby seeks to ask one very simple question. What does wealth actually give us?
1695120	1701920	At face value, it seems obvious. Anything we could ever want. But beware. You'd be surprised
1701920	1706960	just how quickly that list of wants runs out. Sure, you could pay off your debts,
1706960	1711440	travel the world, and buy the fanciest house, car, and clothing, but then what?
1712160	1718320	In consumer society, money is everything. We are taught to view it as this universal cure to
1718320	1723760	whatever ailment we may be suffering. Most Americans spend their whole lives believing this,
1723760	1728320	because they will never have enough wealth to disprove it. As it turns out,
1728320	1732480	no matter how much you have, there are certain things that money can't buy.
1733920	1740000	Jay Gatsby has been described as having more money than God. His fortune is so exorbitant
1740000	1745520	that he never wears the same shirt twice. Gatsby's wealth is practically unlimited,
1745520	1751600	but it's still not quite enough to satisfy his ultimate desire. Across the bay from his estate
1751600	1758240	lies a green light attached to the dock of Daisy Fay. For a man whose money has bought him nearly
1758240	1764800	everything else, she is his final frontier. He is not as much in love with her as he is with
1764800	1771920	the concept of wealth itself. Her voice is full of money. But alas,
1771920	1777200	in a story that mirrored the author's very own heartbreak, this romance was never meant to be.
1777200	1785760	Despite his immense wealth, Gatsby had run into the very same barrier that we thought we
1785760	1792000	vanquished long ago. The Great Gatsby highlights a new distinction which had been sparsely considered
1792000	1798240	at that point in American society. The line between new money and old money. Even though
1798240	1803920	he lives in one of the same enormous mansions overlooking the same Long Island bay, the culture
1803920	1810800	of high society still sees Gatsby as an imposter. He may have more money than God, but he didn't
1810800	1818320	always. Much like Tony Soprano, Gatsby is descended from immigrants. While it's not explicitly stated
1818320	1823520	how he amassed his fortune, it is heavily implied that it comes from organized crime,
1824080	1830400	which notoriously originated during the Prohibition era. However, wealthy society is no
1830400	1837040	stranger to exploitation. It's not the source of Gatsby's money that's the problem, more so that
1837040	1843840	he wasn't outright born with it. Gatsby is new money. He was poor at one point in his life.
1844640	1849520	This immutable characteristic has branded him as an outsider to the rest of the super-rich.
1850240	1854320	They'll attend his parties, but they'll never truly accept him as one of their own.
1855120	1859600	It's the defining attribute separating Gatsby from the story's antagonist,
1859600	1866400	Tom Buchanan, the one man standing between he and Daisy. Much like Patrick Bayman,
1866400	1872880	Tom inherited his life of luxury. He is abrasive, foul-tempered, and a generally detestable
1872880	1879680	individual. By all measures, Gatsby would make a far better husband for Daisy, but therein lies the
1879680	1885600	tragedy of the novel. In the realm of the rich and powerful, the quality of Gatsby's character
1885600	1891600	has been rendered irrelevant. America's class divide is ultimately too much for romance to
1891600	1898960	overcome. Daisy, like Tom, is old money. And at the end of the day, that's the only thing that
1898960	1906080	matters. Regardless of how far he came, Gatsby never even stood a chance. But even though his
1906080	1911920	dream was doomed from the beginning, he never stopped believing it. He kept on pursuing his
1911920	1918000	fairy tale, convincing himself that everything he wanted was just beyond the horizon. He hadn't
1918000	1926480	realized that the party was over. In the months after publication, The Great Gatsby would go on
1926480	1932240	to be a commercial failure. F. Scott Fitzgerald suspected that most readers and critics didn't
1932240	1938640	even understand what the book was about. In a correspondence with his editor in April of 1925,
1938640	1944240	Fitzgerald could see the writing on the wall. He eerily signs off on his letter with the words,
1944240	1973920	yours in Great Depression. Four years later,
1974240	1979360	America's age of indulgence was brought to a screeching halt by the worst economic collapse
1979360	1985520	in our nation's history. All across the land, the unsuspecting poor were punished for the sins of
1985520	1993360	the wealthy. As the United States spiraled further and further downward, so too did Fitzgerald. His
1993360	1999680	once whimsical relationship with Zelda had turned rotten. Following a 1929 incident in which he
1999680	2005680	tried to force their vehicle off a cliff, she was diagnosed with schizophrenia and institutionalized.
2006320	2011760	Fitzgerald continued to work on his next novel, but his persistent alcoholism and lack of
2011760	2017920	motivation delayed the project until long after he was out of the spotlight. In an era of extreme
2017920	2024160	poverty and destitution, America was no longer interested in reading about the excess of the jazz
2024160	2030640	age and Fitzgerald's works began to slip into obscurity. By the mid-30s, he was earning less
2030640	2036480	than a hundred dollars per year off all his books and had to once again settle for being a nobody.
2037200	2042240	Fitzgerald came to view himself as a failure, spending the rest of his life drinking away the
2042240	2049760	pain. The excessive alcohol began to take a severe toll on his health and in 1940 he dropped dead of
2049760	2055680	a heart attack at the age of 44. In an affair that paralleled the end of the Great Gatsby,
2056320	2058400	hardly anyone attended his funeral.
2067120	2071920	It was just a few years later when the Great Gatsby was selected as one of the works distributed
2071920	2078240	to American soldiers serving abroad in World War II. Its newfound popularity sparked a critical
2078240	2084320	reassessment of Fitzgerald's career. In the following decades, his 1925 entry would go on
2084320	2090160	to be appreciated as a masterpiece. Today it stands as one of the most agreed upon candidates
2090160	2095840	for the title of Great American Novel. The struggle between new and old money has stuck
2095840	2101520	around as an enduring archetype in fiction. Its legacy has been carried on by modern day
2101520	2107600	characters like Tony Soprano and Patrick Bayman. It may not be possible to concisely explain what
2107600	2114240	exactly is wrong with America, but whatever it may be, these guys surely embody it. There's
2114240	2119120	something to be said about how these three unique characters from vastly different backgrounds are
2119120	2125120	all chasing the same thing. Dorsia, the ducks, the green light at the end of Daisy's Dock.
2125760	2128880	They each represent the supreme American fantasy.
2128880	2141600	In this country, we want the unobtainable. Before the United States, the world was run on bondage,
2141600	2146320	until somewhere along the way we figured out that you can make people work just a little bit harder
2146320	2152320	by convincing them that the freedom they desire is sitting just out of reach. Is it really a fantasy
2152320	2159040	we follow or a delusion? To be fair, you tend to be a bit delusional when you've gone psycho.
2159760	2165120	Whether or not you want to believe it, the party's over for America. We are experiencing the
2165120	2171840	downfall of a once extravagant empire. Perhaps all this time we weren't chasing a dream, but running
2171840	2178160	from destiny. Regardless, the reality of our situation won't matter. It never has, really.
2178800	2182640	Tomorrow we will run faster, stretch out our arms further.
2182640	2198000	We beat on, boats against the current, borne back ceaselessly into the past.
2208160	2219360	I live in a dilapidated shack on a mosquito-infested swamp between two pit bull breeders.
2219360	2226560	My name is M.Plemon. I'm 24 years old. I believe in taking care of myself, especially below the belt.
2227200	2233600	In the morning, I open up my Manscaped Performance Package 4.0 and start charging the Lawnmower 4.0
2233600	2240080	Body Trimmer while I do my crunches. I can do a dozen now. Once it's fully charged, I take the
2240080	2245840	Lawnmower 4.0 into the shower and manicure my pubic region for 90 minutes until I exhaust the
2245840	2252400	power supply. I then apply the Crop Preserver Ball Deodorant to trap and eliminate any foul stench
2252400	2258560	being exuded by my scrotum. I immediately follow that with the Crop Reviver Ball Toner Spray which
2258560	2264640	contains aloe vera so as to not dry your skin out and make you look older. I finish the rest of my
2264640	2270000	routine with the Weed Whacker Wireless Nose and Ear Trimmer with built-in SkinSafe technology
2270000	2275600	to reduce the chances of nicks and cuts. There is an idea of the perfect YouTube ad,
2276160	2282800	some kind of abstraction, but there is no real pitch, only theatrics. And although I can hide
2282800	2287600	my hatred of marketing and you can see me with the products I'm being paid to sell,
2287600	2291200	and maybe you can sense that I can lead you towards a pretty good deal,
2291840	2297680	it is simply not here. It's down there in the description.

2321120	2325600	But if an expectation that things be done quickly and to a certain level of perfection is demanding,
2326960	2331120	well then yeah we're demanding. You can't drive it parking!
2331120	2337520	He's a pussycat wheelie. We just have a highly developed sense of what we want out of life.
2337520	2341520	You're flying American, right? Absolutely.
2343200	2347360	We've flown more New Yorkers to destinations around the world than any other airline.
2348080	2350480	And if we can keep them happy.
