1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,920
It seems like every year or so you hear about a new threat to YouTube.

2
00:00:03,920 --> 00:00:08,580
Sometimes it's a hot new streaming site that's gonna take all of YouTube's viewers.

3
00:00:08,580 --> 00:00:11,420
And every single time, YouTube wins out.

4
00:00:11,420 --> 00:00:19,260
Sometimes it's a YouTuber who's gonna ruin the culture of YouTube and endanger children and force all the advertisers to pull their funding.

5
00:00:19,260 --> 00:00:25,000
And every single time, that YouTuber winds up irrelevant and forgotten a few years down the line.

6
00:00:25,040 --> 00:00:32,880
Sometimes the big threat to YouTube is the government and the FCC and Net Neutrality and Article 13 and SOPA and PIPA.

7
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:38,040
And every single time, nothing really changes and YouTube pretty much stays the same.

8
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:41,380
Sometimes it seems like YouTube is its own biggest threat.

9
00:00:41,380 --> 00:00:48,460
And whatever new bonehead policy they're rolling out is gonna drive away all the creators and viewers and every single time,

10
00:00:48,460 --> 00:00:54,160
people complain for a bit, YouTubers adapt, and everyone just keeps watching YouTube.

11
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:57,900
It seems like YouTube is really good at dealing with threats,

12
00:00:57,900 --> 00:01:03,740
which is part of the reason why I firmly believe that this site will be around for longer than any of these other ones.

13
00:01:03,740 --> 00:01:07,160
But what was the biggest threat in the history of YouTube?

14
00:01:07,160 --> 00:01:15,700
Was there ever any force or event in the history of YouTube.com that seriously threatened the existence of the entire website?

15
00:01:15,700 --> 00:01:18,940
Well, I'm here to say that such an event did happen.

16
00:01:18,940 --> 00:01:24,860
And it was caused by the most ancient primordial enemy in all of YouTube lore.

17
00:01:24,860 --> 00:01:29,860
A name that will send shivers down the spines of the oldest creators on this website.

18
00:01:29,860 --> 00:01:39,700
On March 13th, 2007, Viacom International Inc. filed a lawsuit against YouTube seeking damages for a site-wide case of copyright infringement.

19
00:01:39,700 --> 00:01:41,020
The price?

20
00:01:41,020 --> 00:01:42,820
One billion dollars.

21
00:01:45,940 --> 00:01:47,200
A company

22
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:48,520
Is like an enormous club.

23
00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:50,520
Is like an enormous club.

24
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:52,520
Yes, precisely.

25
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:57,820
It only works if all the little cogs mesh together.

26
00:01:57,820 --> 00:02:00,320
Stop being metaphorical, Bob.

27
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:02,320
You know what I mean by cooperative cogs?

28
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:12,620
Viacom is the smallest major television media company in the United States.

29
00:02:12,660 --> 00:02:18,320
And much as is the case with dogs, the smallest ones are usually the nastiest.

30
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:30,080
While some companies like Disney or NBC at least make an attempt to portray themselves as fun or cool or having a basic semblance of human emotion, Viacom doesn't bother with any of that.

31
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:35,240
They don't beat around the bush about being a cold, sterile, ruthless corporate entity.

32
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:37,080
But hey, at least they're honest.

33
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:44,780
Viacom doesn't have the immense capital or brand recognition to screw around with a phony PR campaign about how great they are.

34
00:02:44,780 --> 00:02:49,240
Like I said, they're the smallest major television corporation in the US.

35
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:51,160
And it's not easy being small.

36
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:55,780
Well, as small as a multi-billion dollar media conglomerate can be.

37
00:02:55,780 --> 00:03:00,620
But anyway, being the smallest part of any group makes you the most vulnerable target.

38
00:03:00,620 --> 00:03:06,320
Heck, Viacom has spent almost half of its history merging in and out of existence with CBS.

39
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:10,060
Like any company, Viacom would certainly like to grow bigger.

40
00:03:10,060 --> 00:03:19,980
But it's not as easy for them as a company like Disney that can just coast off of the revenue from the gargantuan amount of stuff they own and use that revenue to buy even more stuff.

41
00:03:19,980 --> 00:03:22,700
Viacom doesn't exactly have the same liberty.

42
00:03:22,700 --> 00:03:25,160
They can't afford to take as many risks.

43
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:29,200
When they find something that makes money, they have to cling onto it for dear life.

44
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:34,700
And most importantly, when they find an opportunity, they have to seize it hard.

45
00:03:34,700 --> 00:03:40,000
In 2007, Viacom was less than two years removed from splitting off of CBS.

46
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:44,040
The company was at its most vulnerable point in more than a decade.

47
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:53,340
And when Viacom realized that an unknown Silicon Valley startup called YouTube had potentially infringed their copyright, they knew it was time to strike.

48
00:03:53,340 --> 00:04:14,180
Viacom claimed that YouTube had committed brazen copyright infringement from over 150,000 clips of Viacom TV shows, accruing over 1.5 billion views in total, leading Viacom to demand $1 billion in damages.

49
00:04:14,180 --> 00:04:16,480
Where did they get a billion from? I don't know.

50
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:22,940
$1 billion certainly does not represent the ad revenue that you could potentially earn from 1.5 billion views.

51
00:04:22,940 --> 00:04:29,000
And on top of that, this was 2007 when online ad rates were much lower than they are today.

52
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:33,880
Perhaps Viacom was factoring in the potential lost DVD sales or something.

53
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:37,300
It doesn't really matter, and it doesn't have to make sense either.

54
00:04:37,300 --> 00:04:44,600
The point is that $1 billion is a scary amount of money to lose, even for a tech giant like Google.

55
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:51,680
YouTube actually had something in common with Viacom, since they too had recently undergone their own change in ownership.

56
00:04:51,680 --> 00:05:01,140
Many modern day critics of YouTube's practices like to point to this event as the moment YouTube died, when realistically, the exact opposite is true.

57
00:05:01,140 --> 00:05:09,980
In the first two years of YouTube's existence, the site's exponential growth in traffic left its founders struggling with mounting costs and legal problems.

58
00:05:09,980 --> 00:05:14,740
Even today, it is still unclear whether or not YouTube is actually profitable.

59
00:05:14,740 --> 00:05:20,500
Like it or not, Google purchasing YouTube was completely necessary for the site to stay alive.

60
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:26,040
And it was especially necessary for combating one of the biggest lawsuits in the history of the internet.

61
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:30,180
A legal defeat would have started a catastrophic chain of events for YouTube.

62
00:05:30,180 --> 00:05:40,540
Not only would it result in a massive financial loss, it would open the door for every other media company to demand their own compensation for copyright damages.

63
00:05:40,540 --> 00:05:50,140
YouTube would have been financially gutted, and Google would have most likely been forced to do what they do with all of their failed ventures, abandon the site entirely.

64
00:05:50,140 --> 00:05:58,140
Beyond that, the legal precedent of this case had the potential to drastically restrict the nature of copyrighted material on the entire web.

65
00:05:58,140 --> 00:06:08,300
Imagine a version of the internet where a website like YouTube could not exist due to fear of legal extermination in the event that someone uploads any clip from a TV show.

66
00:06:08,300 --> 00:06:10,740
These were the stakes of the lawsuit.

67
00:06:10,740 --> 00:06:16,820
And the tremendous implications of this legal case rested on the shoulders of the Honorable Judge Louis Stanton.

68
00:06:21,140 --> 00:06:25,140
The key legal issue of this case was the following.

69
00:06:25,140 --> 00:06:32,140
Viacom claimed that YouTube violated copyright law by allowing its users to upload their content without permission.

70
00:06:32,140 --> 00:06:36,140
YouTube did not dispute that. I mean, come on. They were everywhere.

71
00:06:36,140 --> 00:06:42,140
There was no getting around the fact that a boatload of Viacom-owned videos were uploaded to YouTube.

72
00:06:42,140 --> 00:06:48,140
YouTube's defense was that the DMCA's Safe Harbor provision exempted them from liability.

73
00:06:48,140 --> 00:06:56,140
So what is the DMCA, besides that scary looking thing that's listed whenever your YouTube videos get copyright claimed?

74
00:06:56,140 --> 00:07:05,140
Well, the DMCA is an American copyright law that directly influences the copyright policy on practically every major website.

75
00:07:06,140 --> 00:07:13,140
When your YouTube video gets taken down by a copyright claim, that is the result of YouTube complying with the DMCA.

76
00:07:13,140 --> 00:07:21,140
Since nearly every major website is based out of the United States, they must comply with the DMCA in order to legally operate.

77
00:07:21,140 --> 00:07:31,140
Within the DMCA is a provision called OSILLA that protects online service providers like Google and YouTube from being held liable for copyright violations on their platform.

78
00:07:31,140 --> 00:07:40,140
This provision is otherwise known as the DMCA Safe Harbor, and in the Viacom lawsuit, YouTube had to argue that they qualified for Safe Harbor protection.

79
00:07:40,140 --> 00:07:47,140
In order to qualify for Safe Harbor protection, an online service provider must meet five requirements.

80
00:07:47,140 --> 00:07:54,140
In order to win this case, YouTube would have to prove that they had no idea what was going on on their website.

81
00:07:54,140 --> 00:07:57,140
This tangent would serve as the crux for the whole lawsuit.

82
00:07:57,140 --> 00:08:04,140
The subsequent legal battle would churn on for years, but the consequences of the lawsuit became known almost immediately.

83
00:08:04,140 --> 00:08:08,140
YouTube quickly scrambled to implement their content ID system.

84
00:08:08,140 --> 00:08:16,140
So how can copyright holders identify these uses of their content on YouTube, control them, and even take advantage of these new forms of user distribution?

85
00:08:16,140 --> 00:08:23,140
The answer is Content ID, a system we've built that gives copyright holders choices about whether and how their content is shown on YouTube.

86
00:08:23,140 --> 00:08:35,140
This system is still around on YouTube today, and it allows media companies to register their copyrighted material on a database that gets used to check and claim new uploads for copyright infringement.

87
00:08:35,140 --> 00:08:42,140
Of course, when Content ID first debuted, it went haywire with taking down videos and terminating YouTube channels.

88
00:08:42,140 --> 00:08:47,140
For comparison, it was executed about as well as the demonetization system from last year.

89
00:08:47,140 --> 00:08:49,140
So make of that what you will.

90
00:08:49,140 --> 00:08:55,140
As a former YouTube pooper, just thinking about this era gives me Vietnam-like flashbacks.

91
00:08:55,140 --> 00:09:03,140
Ironically, in YouTube's quest to establish their own safe harbor, they had completely neglected another safe harbor provision in fair use.

92
00:09:03,140 --> 00:09:10,140
It would be many years in the future before YouTube would even attempt to reconcile that issue, but it didn't matter.

93
00:09:10,140 --> 00:09:13,140
Nothing about fair use or unfair takedowns mattered at this point.

94
00:09:13,140 --> 00:09:18,140
YouTube had to wait until the end of the year for content to be released.

95
00:09:19,140 --> 00:09:20,140
But it didn't matter.

96
00:09:20,140 --> 00:09:24,140
Nothing about fair use or unfair takedowns mattered at this point.

97
00:09:24,140 --> 00:09:28,140
YouTube had to win this lawsuit, or else they may not have had a future at all.

98
00:09:28,140 --> 00:09:38,140
Fire in the court!

99
00:09:38,140 --> 00:09:45,140
Funding for YouTube Geographic is provided by NordVPN.

100
00:09:45,140 --> 00:09:55,140
Contributions from patrons like Babalu Productions, Probuscus, LGBTQIA, Nuo Dunkel, Etienne Senpai,

101
00:09:55,140 --> 00:09:59,140
I can't believe I have to read this dumb name out loud,

102
00:09:59,140 --> 00:10:05,140
SpinyPuffles, Felix Gomez, DatSimpleNope, and by viewers like you.

103
00:10:05,140 --> 00:10:06,140
Thank you.

104
00:10:11,140 --> 00:10:14,140
I have ten high-priced lois!

105
00:10:20,140 --> 00:10:22,140
Ryakon

106
00:10:25,140 --> 00:10:29,140
The next major proceeding in the case came in July 2008,

107
00:10:29,140 --> 00:10:36,140
when Judge Stanton ordered YouTube to hand over the private viewing data of every user who had ever visited the site.

108
00:10:36,140 --> 00:10:42,140
Viacom required the data to search for evidence of YouTube knowingly benefiting from the copyrighted material.

109
00:10:42,140 --> 00:10:49,140
YouTube argued that their users' data was protected under the Video Privacy Protection Act of 1988.

110
00:10:49,140 --> 00:10:55,140
Judge Stanton overruled this claim, however, because YouTube was not a video tape service provider.

111
00:10:55,140 --> 00:10:59,140
Looking at it today, this statement may seem completely ridiculous,

112
00:10:59,140 --> 00:11:05,140
but you have to remember that back in 2008, the internet wasn't nearly as pervasive as it is today.

113
00:11:05,140 --> 00:11:09,140
Most Americans had only just gained access to broadband internet.

114
00:11:09,140 --> 00:11:15,140
Internet speeds had only just become fast enough for average users to reliably stream online video.

115
00:11:15,140 --> 00:11:20,140
Most computers still looked like this, the original iPhone was only a year old,

116
00:11:20,140 --> 00:11:25,140
and it would be three years before the majority of Americans would even own a smartphone.

117
00:11:25,140 --> 00:11:29,140
Twitter was just two years old, Spotify came out that year,

118
00:11:29,140 --> 00:11:35,140
Bitcoin and Google Docs were a year away, Instagram was two years away, and Snapchat was three years away.

119
00:11:35,140 --> 00:11:39,140
Needless to say, the internet was a very different place ten years ago,

120
00:11:39,140 --> 00:11:44,140
and many people still saw it as a gimmick rather than a staple of everyday life.

121
00:11:45,140 --> 00:11:48,140
It's likely that when Judge Stanton made this ruling,

122
00:11:48,140 --> 00:11:52,140
he perceived YouTube as much closer to LimeWire than to television.

123
00:11:52,140 --> 00:11:57,140
Naturally, the prospect of Viacom commandeering the private data from millions of users

124
00:11:57,140 --> 00:12:01,140
sparked outrage among YouTubers and digital rights groups.

125
00:12:05,140 --> 00:12:09,140
Apparently, when Viacom is not killing the unborn and clubbing baby seals,

126
00:12:09,140 --> 00:12:11,140
they just want to get to know us a little more.

127
00:12:11,140 --> 00:12:14,140
They're going to look at every single bit of data that YouTube has gathered,

128
00:12:14,140 --> 00:12:18,140
and that means every video that you ever watched on YouTube.

129
00:12:18,140 --> 00:12:22,140
It just really sucks that one huge conglomerate can set legal precedent,

130
00:12:22,140 --> 00:12:28,140
which says, hey, yeah, it's okay for a company to get all of your private information if they ask for it.

131
00:12:28,140 --> 00:12:33,140
Finally, here are the companies that Viacom owns that need to be boycotted immediately.

132
00:12:33,140 --> 00:12:37,140
Companies like Viacom are betting that you will not stand up to them,

133
00:12:37,140 --> 00:12:39,140
so here's your chance to prove them wrong.

134
00:12:39,140 --> 00:12:46,140
It was one of the first events in the history of YouTube that truly galvanized a call to action from all corners of the site,

135
00:12:46,140 --> 00:12:50,140
and it was one of the first times YouTubers ever felt that they were part of a community.

136
00:12:50,140 --> 00:12:57,140
Thankfully, Viacom gave in to the backlash and agreed to allow Google to anonymize the data before handing it over.

137
00:12:57,140 --> 00:13:02,140
Internet users could now breathe easy as a massive breach in privacy had been averted.

138
00:13:02,140 --> 00:13:03,140
Oh, man!

139
00:13:03,140 --> 00:13:12,140
Curiously, within the next decade, Google would begin to see the value in the very same user data they sought to protect from the Viacom lawsuit,

140
00:13:12,140 --> 00:13:16,140
and they began cultivating user data on an unprecedented scale.

141
00:13:16,140 --> 00:13:19,140
What are they doing with this data? Who knows?

142
00:13:19,140 --> 00:13:21,140
Certainly not anything bad, right?

143
00:13:33,140 --> 00:13:36,140
As I said before, the shocks may be painful, but they're not dangerous.

144
00:13:36,140 --> 00:13:39,140
Well, at least they're hollering. He can't stand it. What if something happens to him?

145
00:13:39,140 --> 00:13:42,140
The experiment requires that you continue to...

146
00:13:42,140 --> 00:13:44,140
300 volts.

147
00:13:47,140 --> 00:13:50,140
They let you keep the piece of brain they cut out.

148
00:13:52,140 --> 00:13:59,140
Well, anyway, the point is that in 2008, YouTube users managed to keep their privacy, but not YouTube employees,

149
00:13:59,140 --> 00:14:10,140
and Viacom would use the internal emails of YouTube employees as damning evidence of YouTube knowingly allowing copyrighted content to thrive on their platform.

150
00:14:10,140 --> 00:14:13,140
YouTube's whole case was falling apart.

151
00:14:13,140 --> 00:14:21,140
Viacom could have made a compelling argument that YouTube failed to meet a single requirement for safe harbor protection from copyright infringement.

152
00:14:21,140 --> 00:14:27,140
And I truly believe that Viacom would have won this case if it weren't for one little mistake.

153
00:14:28,140 --> 00:14:39,140
In a stupendously idiotic blunder, Viacom had actually uploaded their own shows to YouTube in the months prior to the suit as part of a guerrilla marketing campaign.

154
00:14:39,140 --> 00:14:44,140
Now these weren't official clips on an official Viacom endorsed YouTube channel.

155
00:14:44,140 --> 00:14:54,140
These videos were deliberately disguised as unauthorized leaks by no-name users, attempting to emulate the authentic YouTube experience.

156
00:14:54,140 --> 00:15:04,140
According to YouTube's chief legal counsel, Zahava Levie, Viacom hired no fewer than 18 marketing agencies to upload their TV shows to the site.

157
00:15:04,140 --> 00:15:09,140
They purposely roughed up the videos to give them the appearance of stolen content.

158
00:15:09,140 --> 00:15:18,140
They even allegedly had their employees walk across the street to Kinko's and upload the videos there so that they could not be traced back to Viacom.

159
00:15:18,140 --> 00:15:22,140
Why would Viacom do this? I have no idea.

160
00:15:22,140 --> 00:15:25,140
Something about appealing to millennials, I guess?

161
00:15:25,140 --> 00:15:30,140
It still baffles me why any company would go so far to steal their own content.

162
00:15:30,140 --> 00:15:41,140
But apparently this tactic worked so well that not even Viacom's own employees could keep track of which videos were uploaded from their own discretion and which were actually stolen.

163
00:15:41,140 --> 00:15:52,140
When proposed with the idea of removing some popular clips from The Daily Show and The Colbert Report, the president of Comedy Central reportedly advised the network to leave the clips up on YouTube.

164
00:15:52,140 --> 00:16:01,140
Viacom's internal departments had completely mixed directives on whether they wanted to remove infringing YouTube videos of their TV shows.

165
00:16:01,140 --> 00:16:13,140
Sometimes they would demand that YouTube remove a stolen clip only to realize that it was one of their own authorized fake stolen clips and then request that YouTube reinstate the clip.

166
00:16:13,140 --> 00:16:26,140
This totally absurd and confusing series of events ultimately led to Viacom suing YouTube for copyright infringement on content which included videos that Viacom themselves had uploaded.

167
00:16:26,140 --> 00:16:33,140
Viacom had YouTube on the ropes, but this one mistake allowed YouTube to activate their trap cards.

168
00:16:35,140 --> 00:16:47,140
Since Viacom themselves could not keep track of which of their TV clips were uploaded with permission, it was therefore unreasonable to expect YouTube to accurately know which videos to remove.

169
00:16:47,140 --> 00:16:55,140
YouTube could prove that they had no knowledge of the infringing material because it was impossible to determine which videos were truly infringing.

170
00:16:55,140 --> 00:17:00,140
Viacom's whole lawsuit came crumbling down because of a technicality.

171
00:17:00,140 --> 00:17:10,140
It may seem like a silly deus ex machina for one of the most important cases in internet history, but personally I couldn't think of a more fitting end for a company like Viacom.

172
00:17:10,140 --> 00:17:18,140
Their status as the smallest major American television company forced them into a mentality of penny pinching and corner cutting.

173
00:17:18,140 --> 00:17:28,140
They were too cheap to run an actual marketing campaign on the internet, so they did the next best thing, using a flashy new site called YouTube to promote their shows for free.

174
00:17:28,140 --> 00:17:33,140
And even as YouTube complied with all of their requests, Viacom still wanted more.

175
00:17:33,140 --> 00:17:36,140
They wanted to have their cake and eat it too.

176
00:17:36,140 --> 00:17:43,140
Viacom took advantage of YouTube for months of free promotion, then they tried to rob them for everything they had.

177
00:17:43,140 --> 00:17:50,140
Little did Viacom know, their own suffocating corporate structure would trip them up and ultimately lead to their defeat.

178
00:17:50,140 --> 00:18:00,140
On June 23rd, 2010, Judge Stanton ruled in favor of YouTube, holding that the website did operate within the DMCA safe harbor provision.

179
00:18:00,140 --> 00:18:04,140
Viacom's blunder became the determining factor in Stanton's decision.

180
00:18:04,140 --> 00:18:12,140
Who knows, maybe in an alternate universe, Viacom didn't make the same mistake, and you all would be watching this on Daily Motion right now.

181
00:18:12,140 --> 00:18:14,140
It came really close to happening too.

182
00:18:14,140 --> 00:18:18,140
If only Viacom had been a little less... brazen.

183
00:18:18,140 --> 00:18:20,140
Bailiffs, place the mayor under arrest.

184
00:18:20,140 --> 00:18:21,140
What?

185
00:18:21,140 --> 00:18:23,140
Oh yes, all that stuff I did.

186
00:18:23,140 --> 00:18:26,140
Boy, I really hope somebody got fired for that blunder.

187
00:18:28,140 --> 00:18:31,140
Of course, the story doesn't end here.

188
00:18:31,140 --> 00:18:36,140
Viacom wasn't satisfied with losing out on a billion dollar payday because of a technicality.

189
00:18:36,140 --> 00:18:45,140
They immediately appealed the decision, stressing how YouTube at one time knowingly ignored copyrighted content in order to grow their user base.

190
00:18:46,140 --> 00:18:53,140
Luckily for YouTube, the sluggish speed of the legal system compared to the rapid growth of the internet helped ensure their survival.

191
00:18:53,140 --> 00:19:07,140
The appellate court did not reach a decision until April 2012, where they determined that a reasonable jury could have found YouTube guilty of knowingly hosting infringing content and sent the case back down to the district court for further judgment.

192
00:19:07,140 --> 00:19:17,140
Even though this reopened the threat for YouTube, the site had transformed into a very different place from how it was way back in 2007 at the beginning of the lawsuit.

193
00:19:17,140 --> 00:19:26,140
During the five years Viacom spent butting heads with YouTube in court, other media companies began seeing more value in cooperating with YouTube instead.

194
00:19:26,140 --> 00:19:36,140
In November 2008, YouTube reached a deal with CBS, MGM, and Lionsgate to make full length movies and TV shows available to rent on the platform.

195
00:19:36,140 --> 00:19:45,140
In 2009, practically the entire American music industry partnered with YouTube by syndicating industry music videos through Vevo.

196
00:19:45,140 --> 00:19:53,140
From 2006 to 2012, YouTube's monthly active users had grown from 20 million to 800 million.

197
00:19:54,140 --> 00:20:01,140
YouTube was no longer just a trendy, gimmicky tech startup. They were now a dominant force in the future of entertainment.

198
00:20:01,140 --> 00:20:07,140
YouTube began as just another checkers piece and they wound up becoming the chessboard.

199
00:20:07,140 --> 00:20:14,140
Other media companies had to respect YouTube or risk losing everything when people eventually stopped playing checkers.

200
00:20:14,140 --> 00:20:22,140
That's why by 2012, there was never really any concern that this once daunting lawsuit would threaten YouTube anymore.

201
00:20:22,140 --> 00:20:25,140
The paradigm had simply shifted in YouTube's favor.

202
00:20:25,140 --> 00:20:33,140
And for this reason, it should be no surprise why in 2013, Judge Stanton ruled in favor of YouTube on all four issues in the case.

203
00:20:33,140 --> 00:20:40,140
A clear and decisive victory for not just YouTube, but the video streaming rights of the internet as a whole.

204
00:20:40,140 --> 00:20:48,140
Viacom and their unending hubris refused to concede defeat and filed yet another appeal, but eventually reality caught up with them.

205
00:20:48,140 --> 00:20:57,140
In March 2014, seven years after the beginning of the lawsuit, Viacom and YouTube settled the case out of court where no money reportedly changed hands.

206
00:20:57,140 --> 00:21:03,140
Viacom was originally seeking one billion dollars from YouTube. They ended up getting nothing.

207
00:21:07,140 --> 00:21:14,140
Today, you can find basically any movie or TV show available to buy or rent on YouTube, even ones from Viacom.

208
00:21:14,140 --> 00:21:23,140
Although I've never known anyone who actually pays for these, you can probably find the same shows for free on one of those bootleg 24-7 live streams.

209
00:21:23,140 --> 00:21:31,140
Ironically, these streams could probably give companies like Viacom the grounds to sue YouTube yet again, but I don't see that happening.

210
00:21:31,140 --> 00:21:39,140
Like I said earlier, YouTube is now the chessboard and Viacom has been relegated to a pawn occupying their space.

211
00:21:39,140 --> 00:21:47,140
We've reached a point in time when a lot of people are quitting checkers, and Viacom is now compelled to remain in YouTube's good graces.

212
00:21:47,140 --> 00:21:54,140
The television media companies of old have been forced to work with YouTube, and you can see the effects of this just about everywhere.

213
00:21:54,140 --> 00:22:00,140
Whereas in the old days of YouTube, copyright violations would just get your videos taken down and your channel striked,

214
00:22:00,140 --> 00:22:06,140
copyright claimants today are more than happy to keep your video online just as long as they can earn revenue from it.

215
00:22:06,140 --> 00:22:11,140
The YouTube game is always changing, and that's part of the reason I find it so fun.

216
00:22:11,140 --> 00:22:16,140
YouTube always has some major conflict going on, and there's always something to complain about.

217
00:22:16,140 --> 00:22:22,140
When I was starting out on this website, the Content ID system was terrible, unfair, and broken.

218
00:22:22,140 --> 00:22:25,140
Now, it's the demonetization system.

219
00:22:25,140 --> 00:22:31,140
It's easy to look at all of YouTube's problems and lament how the people running this site have no idea what's going on on their platform,

220
00:22:31,140 --> 00:22:35,140
but it's important to remember that legally, they can't.

221
00:22:35,140 --> 00:22:42,140
All of the frustrating automation and algorithms and AI exist so that YouTube can continue to exist,

222
00:22:42,140 --> 00:22:48,140
because if the people working at YouTube officially knew about some of the sketchy stuff on this website,

223
00:22:48,140 --> 00:22:51,140
then they probably couldn't be allowed to run it.

224
00:22:51,140 --> 00:22:56,140
When it comes to running YouTube, ignorance is not just a hallmark. It's a necessity.

225
00:22:57,140 --> 00:23:10,140
In February 2018, representing a total reversal of their prior legal war, Viacom finalized a deal to acquire VidCon,

226
00:23:10,140 --> 00:23:13,140
the most coveted YouTube convention in the world.

227
00:23:13,140 --> 00:23:18,140
The biggest threat in YouTube's history ended up becoming just another business partner.

228
00:23:18,140 --> 00:23:22,140
I guess that's just the way things are in the corporate era of YouTube.

229
00:23:22,140 --> 00:23:26,140
But hey, it's just business, and you know how the old saying goes,

230
00:23:26,140 --> 00:23:29,140
keep your friends close and your enemies closer.

231
00:23:46,140 --> 00:23:49,140
So this video is probably a lot for you guys to take in.

232
00:23:49,140 --> 00:23:54,140
Even though it's easy to stand in awe watching two giant corporate monsters slug it out,

233
00:23:54,140 --> 00:23:58,140
it can also leave you feeling powerless to do anything about it.

234
00:23:58,140 --> 00:24:05,140
Viacom alone was willing to jeopardize the rights of millions of YouTubers just for some extra money to expand their profit margins.

235
00:24:05,140 --> 00:24:13,140
And if you thought that was bad, the European Union is trying to do the same thing by banning memes across an entire continent.

236
00:24:13,140 --> 00:24:18,140
When monstrous entities as big as the EU and Viacom and Google start brawling,

237
00:24:18,140 --> 00:24:22,140
it's easy for a bunch of us little guys to get stepped on in the process.

238
00:24:22,140 --> 00:24:26,140
So with that being said, what can you do to protect yourself from getting run over?

239
00:24:26,140 --> 00:24:29,140
Well, if this was 30 years ago, then you'd probably be out of luck.

240
00:24:29,140 --> 00:24:33,140
But thankfully, the rise of the internet has really helped level the playing field.

241
00:24:33,140 --> 00:24:36,140
Corporations and world governments have caught on to this,

242
00:24:36,140 --> 00:24:42,140
which is why they've spent much of the last decade trying to regulate, control, and censor everything they can.

243
00:24:42,140 --> 00:24:45,140
And that brings us to this video's sponsor.

244
00:24:46,140 --> 00:24:49,140
NordVPN

245
00:24:49,140 --> 00:24:59,140
Mark Zuckerberg and Susan Wojcicki are making out right now on a pile of money that they got from selling your information to shady companies who want to spam you with minions ads.

246
00:24:59,140 --> 00:25:05,140
Using a VPN will help make it harder for massive tech companies to leech off of your personal data.

247
00:25:05,140 --> 00:25:12,140
Any of you out there right now browsing the web completely unprotected are basically giving ruthless tech CEOs free money.

248
00:25:12,140 --> 00:25:18,140
So how about getting yourself a nice slice of NordVPN and demonetizing Susan for a change?

249
00:25:18,140 --> 00:25:22,140
And don't think I've forgotten about you poor saps over there in Europe.

250
00:25:22,140 --> 00:25:27,140
Your corrupt legion of unelected bureaucrats are trying to ban everyone from everything.

251
00:25:27,140 --> 00:25:34,140
Let's not kid ourselves here, Article 13 is going to pass, because when has the EU ever done anything to help Europeans?

252
00:25:34,140 --> 00:25:38,140
It's not going to do anything to YouTube, because nothing ever does.

253
00:25:38,140 --> 00:25:44,140
So naturally that just leaves you Europeans to bear the full brunt of your government's bad ideas.

254
00:25:44,140 --> 00:25:48,140
So don't let your government tell you what memes you can and can't share.

255
00:25:48,140 --> 00:25:54,140
Use NordVPN to relocate your IP address to a country that's not completely spineless.

256
00:25:54,140 --> 00:25:59,140
Take back control of your web browsing and experience the internet as it was intended.
