0	3920	It seems like every year or so you hear about a new threat to YouTube.
3920	8580	Sometimes it's a hot new streaming site that's gonna take all of YouTube's viewers.
8580	11420	And every single time, YouTube wins out.
11420	19260	Sometimes it's a YouTuber who's gonna ruin the culture of YouTube and endanger children and force all the advertisers to pull their funding.
19260	25000	And every single time, that YouTuber winds up irrelevant and forgotten a few years down the line.
25040	32880	Sometimes the big threat to YouTube is the government and the FCC and Net Neutrality and Article 13 and SOPA and PIPA.
32880	38040	And every single time, nothing really changes and YouTube pretty much stays the same.
38040	41380	Sometimes it seems like YouTube is its own biggest threat.
41380	48460	And whatever new bonehead policy they're rolling out is gonna drive away all the creators and viewers and every single time,
48460	54160	people complain for a bit, YouTubers adapt, and everyone just keeps watching YouTube.
54160	57900	It seems like YouTube is really good at dealing with threats,
57900	63740	which is part of the reason why I firmly believe that this site will be around for longer than any of these other ones.
63740	67160	But what was the biggest threat in the history of YouTube?
67160	75700	Was there ever any force or event in the history of YouTube.com that seriously threatened the existence of the entire website?
75700	78940	Well, I'm here to say that such an event did happen.
78940	84860	And it was caused by the most ancient primordial enemy in all of YouTube lore.
84860	89860	A name that will send shivers down the spines of the oldest creators on this website.
89860	99700	On March 13th, 2007, Viacom International Inc. filed a lawsuit against YouTube seeking damages for a site-wide case of copyright infringement.
99700	101020	The price?
101020	102820	One billion dollars.
105940	107200	A company
107200	108520	Is like an enormous club.
108520	110520	Is like an enormous club.
110520	112520	Yes, precisely.
112520	117820	It only works if all the little cogs mesh together.
117820	120320	Stop being metaphorical, Bob.
120320	122320	You know what I mean by cooperative cogs?
127320	132620	Viacom is the smallest major television media company in the United States.
132660	138320	And much as is the case with dogs, the smallest ones are usually the nastiest.
138320	150080	While some companies like Disney or NBC at least make an attempt to portray themselves as fun or cool or having a basic semblance of human emotion, Viacom doesn't bother with any of that.
150080	155240	They don't beat around the bush about being a cold, sterile, ruthless corporate entity.
155240	157080	But hey, at least they're honest.
157080	164780	Viacom doesn't have the immense capital or brand recognition to screw around with a phony PR campaign about how great they are.
164780	169240	Like I said, they're the smallest major television corporation in the US.
169240	171160	And it's not easy being small.
171160	175780	Well, as small as a multi-billion dollar media conglomerate can be.
175780	180620	But anyway, being the smallest part of any group makes you the most vulnerable target.
180620	186320	Heck, Viacom has spent almost half of its history merging in and out of existence with CBS.
186320	190060	Like any company, Viacom would certainly like to grow bigger.
190060	199980	But it's not as easy for them as a company like Disney that can just coast off of the revenue from the gargantuan amount of stuff they own and use that revenue to buy even more stuff.
199980	202700	Viacom doesn't exactly have the same liberty.
202700	205160	They can't afford to take as many risks.
205160	209200	When they find something that makes money, they have to cling onto it for dear life.
209200	214700	And most importantly, when they find an opportunity, they have to seize it hard.
214700	220000	In 2007, Viacom was less than two years removed from splitting off of CBS.
220000	224040	The company was at its most vulnerable point in more than a decade.
224040	233340	And when Viacom realized that an unknown Silicon Valley startup called YouTube had potentially infringed their copyright, they knew it was time to strike.
233340	254180	Viacom claimed that YouTube had committed brazen copyright infringement from over 150,000 clips of Viacom TV shows, accruing over 1.5 billion views in total, leading Viacom to demand $1 billion in damages.
254180	256480	Where did they get a billion from? I don't know.
256480	262940	$1 billion certainly does not represent the ad revenue that you could potentially earn from 1.5 billion views.
262940	269000	And on top of that, this was 2007 when online ad rates were much lower than they are today.
269000	273880	Perhaps Viacom was factoring in the potential lost DVD sales or something.
273880	277300	It doesn't really matter, and it doesn't have to make sense either.
277300	284600	The point is that $1 billion is a scary amount of money to lose, even for a tech giant like Google.
284600	291680	YouTube actually had something in common with Viacom, since they too had recently undergone their own change in ownership.
291680	301140	Many modern day critics of YouTube's practices like to point to this event as the moment YouTube died, when realistically, the exact opposite is true.
301140	309980	In the first two years of YouTube's existence, the site's exponential growth in traffic left its founders struggling with mounting costs and legal problems.
309980	314740	Even today, it is still unclear whether or not YouTube is actually profitable.
314740	320500	Like it or not, Google purchasing YouTube was completely necessary for the site to stay alive.
320500	326040	And it was especially necessary for combating one of the biggest lawsuits in the history of the internet.
326040	330180	A legal defeat would have started a catastrophic chain of events for YouTube.
330180	340540	Not only would it result in a massive financial loss, it would open the door for every other media company to demand their own compensation for copyright damages.
340540	350140	YouTube would have been financially gutted, and Google would have most likely been forced to do what they do with all of their failed ventures, abandon the site entirely.
350140	358140	Beyond that, the legal precedent of this case had the potential to drastically restrict the nature of copyrighted material on the entire web.
358140	368300	Imagine a version of the internet where a website like YouTube could not exist due to fear of legal extermination in the event that someone uploads any clip from a TV show.
368300	370740	These were the stakes of the lawsuit.
370740	376820	And the tremendous implications of this legal case rested on the shoulders of the Honorable Judge Louis Stanton.
381140	385140	The key legal issue of this case was the following.
385140	392140	Viacom claimed that YouTube violated copyright law by allowing its users to upload their content without permission.
392140	396140	YouTube did not dispute that. I mean, come on. They were everywhere.
396140	402140	There was no getting around the fact that a boatload of Viacom-owned videos were uploaded to YouTube.
402140	408140	YouTube's defense was that the DMCA's Safe Harbor provision exempted them from liability.
408140	416140	So what is the DMCA, besides that scary looking thing that's listed whenever your YouTube videos get copyright claimed?
416140	425140	Well, the DMCA is an American copyright law that directly influences the copyright policy on practically every major website.
426140	433140	When your YouTube video gets taken down by a copyright claim, that is the result of YouTube complying with the DMCA.
433140	441140	Since nearly every major website is based out of the United States, they must comply with the DMCA in order to legally operate.
441140	451140	Within the DMCA is a provision called OSILLA that protects online service providers like Google and YouTube from being held liable for copyright violations on their platform.
451140	460140	This provision is otherwise known as the DMCA Safe Harbor, and in the Viacom lawsuit, YouTube had to argue that they qualified for Safe Harbor protection.
460140	467140	In order to qualify for Safe Harbor protection, an online service provider must meet five requirements.
467140	474140	In order to win this case, YouTube would have to prove that they had no idea what was going on on their website.
474140	477140	This tangent would serve as the crux for the whole lawsuit.
477140	484140	The subsequent legal battle would churn on for years, but the consequences of the lawsuit became known almost immediately.
484140	488140	YouTube quickly scrambled to implement their content ID system.
488140	496140	So how can copyright holders identify these uses of their content on YouTube, control them, and even take advantage of these new forms of user distribution?
496140	503140	The answer is Content ID, a system we've built that gives copyright holders choices about whether and how their content is shown on YouTube.
503140	515140	This system is still around on YouTube today, and it allows media companies to register their copyrighted material on a database that gets used to check and claim new uploads for copyright infringement.
515140	522140	Of course, when Content ID first debuted, it went haywire with taking down videos and terminating YouTube channels.
522140	527140	For comparison, it was executed about as well as the demonetization system from last year.
527140	529140	So make of that what you will.
529140	535140	As a former YouTube pooper, just thinking about this era gives me Vietnam-like flashbacks.
535140	543140	Ironically, in YouTube's quest to establish their own safe harbor, they had completely neglected another safe harbor provision in fair use.
543140	550140	It would be many years in the future before YouTube would even attempt to reconcile that issue, but it didn't matter.
550140	553140	Nothing about fair use or unfair takedowns mattered at this point.
553140	558140	YouTube had to wait until the end of the year for content to be released.
559140	560140	But it didn't matter.
560140	564140	Nothing about fair use or unfair takedowns mattered at this point.
564140	568140	YouTube had to win this lawsuit, or else they may not have had a future at all.
568140	578140	Fire in the court!

599140	605140	SpinyPuffles, Felix Gomez, DatSimpleNope, and by viewers like you.
605140	606140	Thank you.

620140	622140	Ryakon
625140	629140	The next major proceeding in the case came in July 2008,
629140	636140	when Judge Stanton ordered YouTube to hand over the private viewing data of every user who had ever visited the site.
636140	642140	Viacom required the data to search for evidence of YouTube knowingly benefiting from the copyrighted material.
642140	649140	YouTube argued that their users' data was protected under the Video Privacy Protection Act of 1988.
649140	655140	Judge Stanton overruled this claim, however, because YouTube was not a video tape service provider.
655140	659140	Looking at it today, this statement may seem completely ridiculous,
659140	665140	but you have to remember that back in 2008, the internet wasn't nearly as pervasive as it is today.
665140	669140	Most Americans had only just gained access to broadband internet.
669140	675140	Internet speeds had only just become fast enough for average users to reliably stream online video.
675140	680140	Most computers still looked like this, the original iPhone was only a year old,
680140	685140	and it would be three years before the majority of Americans would even own a smartphone.
685140	689140	Twitter was just two years old, Spotify came out that year,
689140	695140	Bitcoin and Google Docs were a year away, Instagram was two years away, and Snapchat was three years away.
695140	699140	Needless to say, the internet was a very different place ten years ago,
699140	704140	and many people still saw it as a gimmick rather than a staple of everyday life.
705140	708140	It's likely that when Judge Stanton made this ruling,
708140	712140	he perceived YouTube as much closer to LimeWire than to television.
712140	717140	Naturally, the prospect of Viacom commandeering the private data from millions of users
717140	721140	sparked outrage among YouTubers and digital rights groups.
725140	729140	Apparently, when Viacom is not killing the unborn and clubbing baby seals,
729140	731140	they just want to get to know us a little more.
731140	734140	They're going to look at every single bit of data that YouTube has gathered,
734140	738140	and that means every video that you ever watched on YouTube.
738140	742140	It just really sucks that one huge conglomerate can set legal precedent,
742140	748140	which says, hey, yeah, it's okay for a company to get all of your private information if they ask for it.
748140	753140	Finally, here are the companies that Viacom owns that need to be boycotted immediately.
753140	757140	Companies like Viacom are betting that you will not stand up to them,
757140	759140	so here's your chance to prove them wrong.
759140	766140	It was one of the first events in the history of YouTube that truly galvanized a call to action from all corners of the site,
766140	770140	and it was one of the first times YouTubers ever felt that they were part of a community.
770140	777140	Thankfully, Viacom gave in to the backlash and agreed to allow Google to anonymize the data before handing it over.
777140	782140	Internet users could now breathe easy as a massive breach in privacy had been averted.
782140	783140	Oh, man!
783140	792140	Curiously, within the next decade, Google would begin to see the value in the very same user data they sought to protect from the Viacom lawsuit,
792140	796140	and they began cultivating user data on an unprecedented scale.
796140	799140	What are they doing with this data? Who knows?
799140	801140	Certainly not anything bad, right?
813140	816140	As I said before, the shocks may be painful, but they're not dangerous.
816140	819140	Well, at least they're hollering. He can't stand it. What if something happens to him?
819140	822140	The experiment requires that you continue to...
822140	824140	300 volts.
827140	830140	They let you keep the piece of brain they cut out.
832140	839140	Well, anyway, the point is that in 2008, YouTube users managed to keep their privacy, but not YouTube employees,
839140	850140	and Viacom would use the internal emails of YouTube employees as damning evidence of YouTube knowingly allowing copyrighted content to thrive on their platform.
850140	853140	YouTube's whole case was falling apart.
853140	861140	Viacom could have made a compelling argument that YouTube failed to meet a single requirement for safe harbor protection from copyright infringement.
861140	867140	And I truly believe that Viacom would have won this case if it weren't for one little mistake.
868140	879140	In a stupendously idiotic blunder, Viacom had actually uploaded their own shows to YouTube in the months prior to the suit as part of a guerrilla marketing campaign.
879140	884140	Now these weren't official clips on an official Viacom endorsed YouTube channel.
884140	894140	These videos were deliberately disguised as unauthorized leaks by no-name users, attempting to emulate the authentic YouTube experience.
894140	904140	According to YouTube's chief legal counsel, Zahava Levie, Viacom hired no fewer than 18 marketing agencies to upload their TV shows to the site.
904140	909140	They purposely roughed up the videos to give them the appearance of stolen content.
909140	918140	They even allegedly had their employees walk across the street to Kinko's and upload the videos there so that they could not be traced back to Viacom.
918140	922140	Why would Viacom do this? I have no idea.
922140	925140	Something about appealing to millennials, I guess?
925140	930140	It still baffles me why any company would go so far to steal their own content.
930140	941140	But apparently this tactic worked so well that not even Viacom's own employees could keep track of which videos were uploaded from their own discretion and which were actually stolen.
941140	952140	When proposed with the idea of removing some popular clips from The Daily Show and The Colbert Report, the president of Comedy Central reportedly advised the network to leave the clips up on YouTube.
952140	961140	Viacom's internal departments had completely mixed directives on whether they wanted to remove infringing YouTube videos of their TV shows.
961140	973140	Sometimes they would demand that YouTube remove a stolen clip only to realize that it was one of their own authorized fake stolen clips and then request that YouTube reinstate the clip.
973140	986140	This totally absurd and confusing series of events ultimately led to Viacom suing YouTube for copyright infringement on content which included videos that Viacom themselves had uploaded.
986140	993140	Viacom had YouTube on the ropes, but this one mistake allowed YouTube to activate their trap cards.
995140	1007140	Since Viacom themselves could not keep track of which of their TV clips were uploaded with permission, it was therefore unreasonable to expect YouTube to accurately know which videos to remove.
1007140	1015140	YouTube could prove that they had no knowledge of the infringing material because it was impossible to determine which videos were truly infringing.
1015140	1020140	Viacom's whole lawsuit came crumbling down because of a technicality.
1020140	1030140	It may seem like a silly deus ex machina for one of the most important cases in internet history, but personally I couldn't think of a more fitting end for a company like Viacom.
1030140	1038140	Their status as the smallest major American television company forced them into a mentality of penny pinching and corner cutting.
1038140	1048140	They were too cheap to run an actual marketing campaign on the internet, so they did the next best thing, using a flashy new site called YouTube to promote their shows for free.
1048140	1053140	And even as YouTube complied with all of their requests, Viacom still wanted more.
1053140	1056140	They wanted to have their cake and eat it too.
1056140	1063140	Viacom took advantage of YouTube for months of free promotion, then they tried to rob them for everything they had.
1063140	1070140	Little did Viacom know, their own suffocating corporate structure would trip them up and ultimately lead to their defeat.
1070140	1080140	On June 23rd, 2010, Judge Stanton ruled in favor of YouTube, holding that the website did operate within the DMCA safe harbor provision.
1080140	1084140	Viacom's blunder became the determining factor in Stanton's decision.
1084140	1092140	Who knows, maybe in an alternate universe, Viacom didn't make the same mistake, and you all would be watching this on Daily Motion right now.
1092140	1094140	It came really close to happening too.
1094140	1098140	If only Viacom had been a little less... brazen.
1098140	1100140	Bailiffs, place the mayor under arrest.
1100140	1101140	What?
1101140	1103140	Oh yes, all that stuff I did.
1103140	1106140	Boy, I really hope somebody got fired for that blunder.
1108140	1111140	Of course, the story doesn't end here.
1111140	1116140	Viacom wasn't satisfied with losing out on a billion dollar payday because of a technicality.
1116140	1125140	They immediately appealed the decision, stressing how YouTube at one time knowingly ignored copyrighted content in order to grow their user base.
1126140	1133140	Luckily for YouTube, the sluggish speed of the legal system compared to the rapid growth of the internet helped ensure their survival.
1133140	1147140	The appellate court did not reach a decision until April 2012, where they determined that a reasonable jury could have found YouTube guilty of knowingly hosting infringing content and sent the case back down to the district court for further judgment.
1147140	1157140	Even though this reopened the threat for YouTube, the site had transformed into a very different place from how it was way back in 2007 at the beginning of the lawsuit.
1157140	1166140	During the five years Viacom spent butting heads with YouTube in court, other media companies began seeing more value in cooperating with YouTube instead.
1166140	1176140	In November 2008, YouTube reached a deal with CBS, MGM, and Lionsgate to make full length movies and TV shows available to rent on the platform.
1176140	1185140	In 2009, practically the entire American music industry partnered with YouTube by syndicating industry music videos through Vevo.
1185140	1193140	From 2006 to 2012, YouTube's monthly active users had grown from 20 million to 800 million.
1194140	1201140	YouTube was no longer just a trendy, gimmicky tech startup. They were now a dominant force in the future of entertainment.
1201140	1207140	YouTube began as just another checkers piece and they wound up becoming the chessboard.
1207140	1214140	Other media companies had to respect YouTube or risk losing everything when people eventually stopped playing checkers.
1214140	1222140	That's why by 2012, there was never really any concern that this once daunting lawsuit would threaten YouTube anymore.
1222140	1225140	The paradigm had simply shifted in YouTube's favor.
1225140	1233140	And for this reason, it should be no surprise why in 2013, Judge Stanton ruled in favor of YouTube on all four issues in the case.
1233140	1240140	A clear and decisive victory for not just YouTube, but the video streaming rights of the internet as a whole.
1240140	1248140	Viacom and their unending hubris refused to concede defeat and filed yet another appeal, but eventually reality caught up with them.
1248140	1257140	In March 2014, seven years after the beginning of the lawsuit, Viacom and YouTube settled the case out of court where no money reportedly changed hands.
1257140	1263140	Viacom was originally seeking one billion dollars from YouTube. They ended up getting nothing.
1267140	1274140	Today, you can find basically any movie or TV show available to buy or rent on YouTube, even ones from Viacom.
1274140	1283140	Although I've never known anyone who actually pays for these, you can probably find the same shows for free on one of those bootleg 24-7 live streams.
1283140	1291140	Ironically, these streams could probably give companies like Viacom the grounds to sue YouTube yet again, but I don't see that happening.
1291140	1299140	Like I said earlier, YouTube is now the chessboard and Viacom has been relegated to a pawn occupying their space.
1299140	1307140	We've reached a point in time when a lot of people are quitting checkers, and Viacom is now compelled to remain in YouTube's good graces.
1307140	1314140	The television media companies of old have been forced to work with YouTube, and you can see the effects of this just about everywhere.
1314140	1320140	Whereas in the old days of YouTube, copyright violations would just get your videos taken down and your channel striked,
1320140	1326140	copyright claimants today are more than happy to keep your video online just as long as they can earn revenue from it.
1326140	1331140	The YouTube game is always changing, and that's part of the reason I find it so fun.
1331140	1336140	YouTube always has some major conflict going on, and there's always something to complain about.
1336140	1342140	When I was starting out on this website, the Content ID system was terrible, unfair, and broken.
1342140	1345140	Now, it's the demonetization system.
1345140	1351140	It's easy to look at all of YouTube's problems and lament how the people running this site have no idea what's going on on their platform,
1351140	1355140	but it's important to remember that legally, they can't.
1355140	1362140	All of the frustrating automation and algorithms and AI exist so that YouTube can continue to exist,
1362140	1368140	because if the people working at YouTube officially knew about some of the sketchy stuff on this website,
1368140	1371140	then they probably couldn't be allowed to run it.
1371140	1376140	When it comes to running YouTube, ignorance is not just a hallmark. It's a necessity.
1377140	1390140	In February 2018, representing a total reversal of their prior legal war, Viacom finalized a deal to acquire VidCon,
1390140	1393140	the most coveted YouTube convention in the world.
1393140	1398140	The biggest threat in YouTube's history ended up becoming just another business partner.
1398140	1402140	I guess that's just the way things are in the corporate era of YouTube.
1402140	1406140	But hey, it's just business, and you know how the old saying goes,
1406140	1409140	keep your friends close and your enemies closer.
1426140	1429140	So this video is probably a lot for you guys to take in.
1429140	1434140	Even though it's easy to stand in awe watching two giant corporate monsters slug it out,
1434140	1438140	it can also leave you feeling powerless to do anything about it.
1438140	1445140	Viacom alone was willing to jeopardize the rights of millions of YouTubers just for some extra money to expand their profit margins.
1445140	1453140	And if you thought that was bad, the European Union is trying to do the same thing by banning memes across an entire continent.
1453140	1458140	When monstrous entities as big as the EU and Viacom and Google start brawling,
1458140	1462140	it's easy for a bunch of us little guys to get stepped on in the process.
1462140	1466140	So with that being said, what can you do to protect yourself from getting run over?
1466140	1469140	Well, if this was 30 years ago, then you'd probably be out of luck.
1469140	1473140	But thankfully, the rise of the internet has really helped level the playing field.
1473140	1476140	Corporations and world governments have caught on to this,
1476140	1482140	which is why they've spent much of the last decade trying to regulate, control, and censor everything they can.
1482140	1485140	And that brings us to this video's sponsor.
1486140	1489140	NordVPN
1489140	1499140	Mark Zuckerberg and Susan Wojcicki are making out right now on a pile of money that they got from selling your information to shady companies who want to spam you with minions ads.
1499140	1505140	Using a VPN will help make it harder for massive tech companies to leech off of your personal data.
1505140	1512140	Any of you out there right now browsing the web completely unprotected are basically giving ruthless tech CEOs free money.
1512140	1518140	So how about getting yourself a nice slice of NordVPN and demonetizing Susan for a change?
1518140	1522140	And don't think I've forgotten about you poor saps over there in Europe.
1522140	1527140	Your corrupt legion of unelected bureaucrats are trying to ban everyone from everything.
1527140	1534140	Let's not kid ourselves here, Article 13 is going to pass, because when has the EU ever done anything to help Europeans?
1534140	1538140	It's not going to do anything to YouTube, because nothing ever does.
1538140	1544140	So naturally that just leaves you Europeans to bear the full brunt of your government's bad ideas.
1544140	1548140	So don't let your government tell you what memes you can and can't share.
1548140	1554140	Use NordVPN to relocate your IP address to a country that's not completely spineless.
