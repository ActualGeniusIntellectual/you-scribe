1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,760
Did you know that the average adult has 5 to 20 pounds of toxic poop in their body at any given moment?

2
00:00:06,760 --> 00:00:09,600
Ads. We see them every day.

3
00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:13,760
And when we do, it's almost always against our will.

4
00:00:13,760 --> 00:00:18,480
The average American is exposed to at least 5,000 ads per day.

5
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:23,360
If given the choice, most of us would probably prefer to see zero.

6
00:00:23,360 --> 00:00:29,760
It turns out that most people don't like being interrupted every five seconds by a manipulative sales pitch.

7
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:34,960
Any sane individual would be far better off avoiding ads whenever possible.

8
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:38,560
It's for this reason that marketing is such a tall order.

9
00:00:38,560 --> 00:00:43,040
How do you make people pay attention to something that no one wants to see?

10
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:49,920
Out of the 5,000 ads we see per day, how many do we even register as anything more than white noise?

11
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:53,840
The vast majority of marketing campaigns are utterly forgettable.

12
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:59,680
And the handful of ads that actually managed to stand out usually do so for the wrong reasons.

13
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:05,840
However, once in a blue moon, we'll encounter an ad that extraordinarily beats the odds.

14
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:10,960
One that we remember for long after whatever they were selling ceased to exist.

15
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:17,120
In 1986, America's most powerful restaurant empire deployed a marketing campaign so brilliant

16
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:21,680
that it still has a place in our culture more than 35 years later.

17
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:28,560
But the full story of one of advertising's most timeless mascots goes back a bit further than 35 years.

18
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:36,480
It all began with an Englishman by the name of John Gay, who in 1728 would unveil the play of the century.

19
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:41,440
The Beggar's Opera was a theatrical performance unlike anything else in its time.

20
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:45,520
It was an opera that set out to make a mockery of opera itself.

21
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:48,560
It not only ridiculed the conventions of the medium,

22
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:53,600
but served as an irreverent critique of the aristocratic world it often glorified.

23
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:58,080
The Beggar's Opera was one of the first definitive examples of counterculture,

24
00:01:58,080 --> 00:02:04,000
one that satirized issues of wealth and corruption among England's most powerful institutions.

25
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:10,480
The show was beloved by audiences and essentially became the first opera to belong to the common man.

26
00:02:10,480 --> 00:02:16,320
This resounding success was due in large part to the play's main character, Captain MacHeath.

27
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:22,800
Considered by some to be one of literature's first anti-heroes, portrayed as a womanizing thief,

28
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:27,120
MacHeath was a character of questionable virtue and undeniable passion.

29
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:31,840
One who succeeded in winning over the audience despite his inherent vices.

30
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:35,760
The Beggar's Opera was the most revolutionary play of its time

31
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:41,040
and would go on to inspire a whole new genre of satirical comedy in theater.

32
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:47,280
Just four years after releasing his magnum opus, John Gay would pass away at the age of 47,

33
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:50,720
never to know what would eventually become of his creation.

34
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:54,480
While his story had ended, Captain Mac's had only just begun.

35
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:03,520
Two hundred years later, the Beggar's Opera would experience a revival in Germany.

36
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:07,360
The play would be retooled by Marxist playwright Bertolt Brecht,

37
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:10,640
who intended to punctuate its anti-capitalist themes.

38
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:16,160
Now renamed to the Three-Penny Opera, the show would once again captivate the masses.

39
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:22,480
Captain Mac would return to his leading role, now wielding a far more unsavory demeanor.

40
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:28,880
This darker version of the character would henceforth be known by another name, Mac the Knife.

41
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:33,040
The new moniker quickly caught on thanks to an unexpected addition to the play.

42
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:38,720
Shortly before the premiere, lead actor Harold Paulson threatened to walk out of the production

43
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:42,000
unless his character received a special introduction.

44
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:47,280
With very little time to spare, composer Kurt Wheel quickly devised what would become

45
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:52,400
the most iconic musical number of the entire play, The Ballad of Mac the Knife.

46
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:03,200
A song that depicts Mac as a serial killer who stabs his victims to death

47
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:04,960
and dumps their bodies in the river.

48
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:09,280
You might be thinking that this far more sinister version of the character

49
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:14,720
would have made him somewhat unpopular, but as fate would have it, the exact opposite was true.

50
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:20,560
After its successful debut in Germany, the Three-Penny Opera would soon be translated

51
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:23,200
and performed in numerous other countries.

52
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:27,040
By the 1950s, the play had arrived in the United States,

53
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:30,080
where it began a six-year run as an off-Broadway show.

54
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:36,560
At around the same time, musicians began recording their own versions of the play's defining song.

55
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:43,120
Louis Armstrong's 1955 cover of Mac the Knife established the tune as a jazz staple.

56
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:47,440
Over the years, more than a dozen artists would put their own spin on the song,

57
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:52,960
but by far the most enduring version would be the one released by Bobby Darin in 1959.

58
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:56,880
Bobby Darin singing Mac the Knife. Let's have a nice hand for him.

59
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:09,760
The single rocketed to the top of the charts in the US and UK,

60
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:13,040
cementing Mac the Knife as an international phenomenon.

61
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:17,840
Darin's big hit resembled the popular genre of crooner music,

62
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:23,680
songs characterized by a smooth soft-spoken male singer paired with big band jazz instrumentals.

63
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:30,320
The style was most closely associated with performers like Frank Sinatra and Bing Crosby,

64
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:34,640
two figures who are inseparable from 20th century Americana.

65
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:38,880
But considering the sanitized culture of 1950s America,

66
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:44,160
it's unusual how something as dark as Mac the Knife wound up being such a mainstream hit.

67
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:48,480
In a time when you weren't allowed to show a toilet on TV,

68
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:53,120
it's somewhat shocking to consider that one of its most popular songs happened to be about

69
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:59,440
a serial killer. Just like the case with nearly all pop music today, most listeners just never

70
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:05,120
pay attention to the lyrics. With that being said, it's not a stretch to suggest that Mac

71
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:08,880
the Knife was essentially the pumped up kicks of the boomer generation.

72
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:18,320
Sing Mac the Knife. And because he wanted to hang out with us, he'd belt it right out.

73
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:29,360
In just 30 years, the song had reached unimaginable heights from its humble German origin.

74
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:34,800
And coincidentally, at around the same time, a certain other German creation would also

75
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:40,080
experience a meteoric rise in the United States. At the turn of the 20th century,

76
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:45,840
a new food item was quickly picking up steam in the American cuisine. The delicacy was thought

77
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:51,040
to have been brought over by immigrants originating from Hamburg, Germany. Of course,

78
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:56,480
this exciting new sandwich would soon become known as the hamburger. And throughout the history of

79
00:06:56,480 --> 00:07:02,560
the American diet, no other food would be more influential. The success of the hamburger had

80
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:08,480
to do with two key advantages. It was a hearty meal that could be prepared very quickly and very

81
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:15,840
cheaply. The founding tenets of America's most famous industry, fast food. In 1961,

82
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:20,160
businessman Ray Kroc completed what was essentially a hostile takeover of the

83
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:25,760
McDonald brothers and their chain of California restaurants. Under his leadership, McDonald's

84
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:31,920
would revolutionize the American food industry with one simple vision. The idea that a customer

85
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:37,360
could visit any restaurant in the country and order an identical sandwich. After a decade of

86
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:43,520
aggressive expansion, the golden arches would span from sea to shining sea. McDonald's had

87
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:49,520
become one of the first truly national brands in America. The new fast food empire ushered in

88
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:58,320
a new era of commerce and along with it, a new challenge in marketing. Sell me this pen.

89
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:06,800
Compared to other disciplines, advertising is relatively new. The practice only began to be

90
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:12,480
seriously studied at around the turn of the 20th century. But while research into the field may

91
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:18,720
still be quite young, it all seeks to answer the same age-old question. Both the art and the

92
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:25,440
science of advertising exist to figure out what people want. Selling a product requires so much

93
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:31,200
more than simply making people aware of its existence. The power of marketing relies on

94
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:37,680
infiltrating the gooey center of human desire. It attempts to deliver us our grandest fantasies,

95
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:44,000
to exploit our deepest fears and insecurities. The purpose of advertising is not to give people

96
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:50,560
what they want, but to redefine the meaning of want. Most products and services in the economy

97
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:56,720
are totally superfluous. They offer the customer no intrinsic value versus any replacement level

98
00:08:56,720 --> 00:09:02,960
item. It is the job of the advertiser to manufacture that value, to convince the customer

99
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:09,120
that a product is more than a product. And perhaps no other company understood this concept more than

100
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:14,960
McDonald's, which sought to brand itself as not just a restaurant, but an American institution.

101
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:20,560
McDonald's prospered by getting working-class families out of their dining rooms and into their

102
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:27,440
restaurants. The golden arches came to symbolize an oasis of comfort and familiarity. No matter

103
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:34,160
how far you were from home, you were never too far from a McDonald's. Across the 60s and 70s,

104
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:39,200
McDonald's marketing acumen brought them tremendous success. Success which quickly

105
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:45,600
drew in competitors. And soon enough, the franchise had several challengers to their fast food throne.

106
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:52,480
The 1980s were truly a landmark time in advertising as newly titanic brands fought for

107
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:58,240
control over a nation of consumers. The marketing battles fought during this time period would

108
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:04,240
dictate the industry leaders of the 21st century. Companies could see that valuable market share was

109
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:10,640
up for grabs based solely on their ability to sell to the American people. As the dominant force in

110
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:16,400
fast food, McDonald's quickly found themselves with a target on their back. All of a sudden,

111
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:21,360
the franchise was under fire from an onslaught of commercials attacking both the quality and

112
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:28,000
quantity of their products. McDonald's was thrust into an advertising arms race, spending millions

113
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:34,080
on radical new campaigns of their own. However, despite their best efforts to subdue their rivals,

114
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:38,720
the company was still losing ground. In order to protect themselves from the pandemic,

115
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:44,560
they had to start thinking outside the box. Fortunately for McDonald's, an unexpected flash

116
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:47,840
of inspiration would come from their biggest business partner.

117
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:53,440
Hi, Max Headroom here with... this is my guest.

118
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:59,920
In 1985, Coca-Cola was looking to regain momentum following the rocky launch of New Coke.

119
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:04,560
They would find a rather unorthodox solution in Max Headroom,

120
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:09,440
an obscure experimental character who had recently sprung up on the British airwaves.

121
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:14,800
The virtual talking head replaced Bill Cosby as Coca-Cola's spokesperson,

122
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:21,600
a change that was met with massive success. Coke had proven the value of manufacturing a cult icon,

123
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:28,640
inspiring McDonald's to brainstorm a character of their own. Like many great creative minds before

124
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:34,160
them, they decided to borrow from the past. And in the winter of 1986,

125
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:37,120
America would be introduced to Mac Tonight.

126
00:11:58,640 --> 00:12:24,720
For the fourth time in his long and convoluted history, Mac was once again on top of the world.

127
00:12:25,280 --> 00:12:30,640
McDonald's had deployed a variety of corporate mascots before, but none moved the needle quite

128
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:36,880
like Mac. It was an ad campaign unlike any other in the company's history. The anthropomorphic

129
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:43,600
crescent moon was a surreal window into the soul of American enterprise. It was bold, decadent,

130
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:50,720
and idealistic. A perfect marriage of nostalgia and pure fantasy. For the fast food eating public,

131
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:55,600
Mac Tonight truly delivered something old, something new, something borrowed, and something

132
00:12:55,600 --> 00:13:02,000
blue. While conceiving the ad, marketing executive Brad Ball and director Peter Katrolis sought to

133
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:07,520
create a veritable Micktopia. The hand-built miniatures and practical costume work gives

134
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:13,200
Mac Tonight an otherworldly aesthetic. A parallel reality where McDonald's has single-handedly

135
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:19,440
ushered in a new epoch of human advancement. A glorious vision of a society that had long since

136
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:25,600
transcended its struggles with crime, poverty, and especially hunger. It was the greasy,

137
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:32,880
delicious future that all of us needed, but none of us deserved. For Los Angeles marketing firm DMJC,

138
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:38,720
it was lightning in a bottle. What was originally planned as a regional campaign quickly expanded

139
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:44,400
nationwide. The ad made a huge impression on consumers, with some stores reporting more than

140
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:50,320
a 10 percent increase in dinnertime business. McDonald's brand recognition skyrocketed,

141
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:54,240
giving the franchise the boost it needed to pull away from its competitors.

142
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:09,280
The character of Mac Tonight was so popular that scheduled meet and greets would draw on over a

143
00:14:09,280 --> 00:14:15,760
thousand visitors from LA to Boca Raton. Over the next three years, actor and contortionist Doug

144
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:21,680
Jones would strap into the moon costume for 25 more commercials. The popularity of the campaign

145
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:27,120
would mark a turning point in his career. Today he is best known for his leading role of the

146
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:33,200
amphibian man in academy award-winning film The Shape of Water. It seemed that no matter where or

147
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:39,600
when Mac appeared, roaring success was sure to follow. By the end of the 80s, he was basking on

148
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:45,600
cloud nine, lifting a fast food empire and its investors all the way to the moon. But in the

149
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:52,400
midst of the company's greatest marketing campaign to date, not all was well in McDonaldland. By

150
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:58,640
becoming the face of the franchise, Mac had strayed a bit too far from his roots. The character was

151
00:14:58,640 --> 00:15:04,480
originally conceived as a critique of wealth and capitalism, only to eventually wind up as the

152
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:10,720
mascot for the most capitalistic company on the planet. The once iconoclastic Captain Mac had

153
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:16,480
effectively sold out, and unfortunately for him, the pendulum was about to swing in the other

154
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:21,840
direction. As fate would have it, the corporate gravy train that he now represented would soon

155
00:15:21,840 --> 00:15:25,760
betray him, as Mac Tonight was sacrificed for the system.

156
00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:36,400
In October 1989, Dodd-Darren filed a 10 million dollar lawsuit against McDonald's claiming that

157
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:42,800
Mac Tonight had infringed on his father's song. At face value, it looked like a pretty nonsensical

158
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:49,600
confrontation. Bobby Darin had passed away more than 15 years earlier, and his defining single

159
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:55,360
wasn't exactly the most original composition. He didn't write the lyrics, he wasn't the first

160
00:15:55,360 --> 00:16:01,440
to perform the song, he hadn't single-handedly invented the crooner style. Like many works

161
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:06,800
involving Mac, it was derivative content that just so happened to be in the right place at the right

162
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:13,440
time. It's hard to say what Bobby Darin even owned that McDonald's could have possibly infringed upon,

163
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:19,760
but due to the oppressive nature of our wonderful copyright system, not even Fortune 500 companies

164
00:16:19,760 --> 00:16:25,600
are exempt from getting pushed around by frivolous greed. Had McDonald's fought the lawsuit, they

165
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:31,200
could have very easily won, but they decided that the legal expense was simply not worth the trouble

166
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:36,880
to save an ad campaign that had pretty much run its course. With very little to gain in court,

167
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:44,320
McDonald's chose to bite the bullet. And so, after nearly four years of service, Mac Tonight's golden

168
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:50,080
run on the airwaves would come to an abrupt end. Who would have thought that after all this time,

169
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:54,000
Mac finally got to experience what it was like to get stabbed in the back?

170
00:16:56,960 --> 00:17:02,080
While their fallen mascot was no longer allowed to perform his signature jingles,

171
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:07,680
McDonald's wouldn't entirely give up on Mac Tonight. Starting in the 90s, they would install

172
00:17:07,680 --> 00:17:13,920
several Mac animatronics which played retro hits in stores across the country. During this time,

173
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:21,280
Mac would still occasionally appear in commercials, including a brief campaign in 1997. That year would

174
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:28,000
also see Mac make his debut in NASCAR, appearing as a select sponsor on Bill Elliott's number 94

175
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:35,600
Ford. In 2007, 20 years after his national debut, a CG Mac would suddenly resurface on the

176
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:42,320
international market, announcing the opening of 24-hour locations in Southeast Asia. But beyond

177
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:48,480
these sparse sightings, Mac Tonight was essentially retired, left to ride off into the sunset as a

178
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:55,200
marketing martyr and a hamburger hero. An ending that was a little too good to be true. By

179
00:17:55,200 --> 00:18:01,040
transforming Mac into the perfect company mascot, McDonald's had to omit the character's more

180
00:18:01,040 --> 00:18:07,920
distasteful attributes. It was a character who was never designed to be a hero, and one who had spent

181
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:14,560
the past two decades running from the sins of his past. The truth is that Mac had built his legacy

182
00:18:14,560 --> 00:18:20,960
not through fame, but through notoriety. In a shocking turn of events, everyone would be rudely

183
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:31,840
reminded about the dark side of the moon. In the mid-2000s, the internet revolution was in full

184
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:38,960
swing. A popular site at the time was the online community YTM&D, a place where users could create

185
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:44,800
their own web pages with looping images and audio. The site quickly became a prominent spawning

186
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:51,440
ground for various memes and subcultures, and in the Wild West era of online moderation, practically

187
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:58,000
nothing was off limits. Possibly the most infamous series of events to ever come out of YTM&D just

188
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:04,720
so happened to involve a certain McDonald's mascot. Users had begun posting gifs of Mac Tonight as

189
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:11,280
early as 2006, but the character's downward descent into degeneracy would truly begin in the spring of

190
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:19,200
2007, all due to an individual by the name of Farkle. Starting in June, he created several sites

191
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:25,840
combining Mac Tonight with AT&T Mike, a text-to-speech bot that could be made to say anything the user

192
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:32,240
desired. As is the case with many things on the internet, what began as simply goofing around

193
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:38,400
quickly devolved into something very profane and very offensive. Farkle's site soon inspired a

194
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:43,920
variety of imitators looking to make their own twisted interpretations of the once family-friendly

195
00:19:43,920 --> 00:19:50,400
character. This heinous new alter ego of Mac Tonight came to be known by a different moniker,

196
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:57,440
Moonman, a name that would live on in infamy. It started with a few racially insensitive chants

197
00:19:57,440 --> 00:20:02,720
and quickly escalated to full-blown song covers advocating for crimes against humanity.

198
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:08,000
Some of these songs were so hideously obscene that they have since been expunged from all

199
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:14,400
but the grittiest corners of the web. As the meme grew in notoriety, so too did the scope of its

200
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:21,040
contributors. In 2008, several of the most prolific Moonman posters would form a faction known as the

201
00:20:21,040 --> 00:20:27,680
Moon Crew, a collection of users dedicated to the advancement of their new lunar overlord. Together,

202
00:20:27,680 --> 00:20:32,800
they would help establish a sophisticated lore around the character, which was unofficially

203
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:38,320
referred to as the Mooniverse. In the following months, the Moon Crew would amass dozens of

204
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:44,240
members who made themselves known as a nuisance to the entire platform. Moonman sites were being

205
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:50,160
created with such abundance that they began to draw the attention of outside forces. During this

206
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:55,440
time, many of the most popular Moonman edits would be frequently re-uploaded to YouTube,

207
00:20:55,440 --> 00:21:03,040
a platform with far stricter rules than YTM&D. Due to the extremely vulgar content of the genre,

208
00:21:03,040 --> 00:21:08,240
most of the YouTube uploads wouldn't last long before getting flagged and removed for community

209
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:14,240
guidelines violations. But despite their short lifespans, the sheer amount of traffic on YouTube

210
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:19,120
meant that it was the most visible place for the public to discover the shocking fate of the fast

211
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:25,600
food legend. Evidently, McDonald's and AT&T must have received some complaints over the meme,

212
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:31,600
with McDonald's issuing copyright strikes and AT&T banning the term Moonman from their text-to-speech

213
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:38,960
service. Even YTM&D attempted to ban the Moon Crew from the platform, but with limitless accounts

214
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:44,800
at their disposal, they could stick around for as long as they pleased. Despite their best efforts

215
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:51,360
to quell the movement, the downfall of Mac Tonight could not be stopped. Moonman was not going

216
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:57,680
anywhere, and for a new generation who had never seen Mac Tonight, it was the only version of him

217
00:21:57,680 --> 00:22:04,320
they ever knew. The racist megalomaniac would persist into the next decade, where he eventually

218
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:11,440
reprised his former role as a mascot, this time representing 4chan's politically incorrect board.

219
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:18,640
And in 2019, the meme was officially inducted into the Anti-Defamation League's list of hate symbols,

220
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:24,480
an ugly ending to one of the most beloved characters of all time. Following the controversial

221
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:30,720
turn, McDonald's would distance itself from their former marketing juggernaut. Nearly all of the

222
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:36,640
Mac Tonight statues and animatronics have since been dismantled, and the character has remained

223
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:43,360
absent from any official promotional material since 2010. Possibly the last remaining artifact

224
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:48,160
of Mac's glorious reign can be found sitting high up in the rafters at the Entertainment

225
00:22:48,160 --> 00:22:54,080
McDonald's in Orlando, Florida. Oh Mac, where did we go so wrong?

226
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:03,120
Mac Tonight's precipitous fall from grace may have been painful to watch,

227
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:07,680
but oddly enough, it helped the character achieve something that very few others could.

228
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:14,000
When you look back at the very beginning of Mac's journey, he was created to illustrate one essential

229
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:20,400
conflict, the struggle of the masses versus the rich and powerful. The beggar's opera told the

230
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:26,080
tale of an unrepentant thief, one who was no less virtuous than the system which outlawed him.

231
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:31,440
It made a bold statement that the only difference between a thief and an aristocrat is the number

232
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:37,600
of zeros in their bank account. Before anything can be stolen, we must choose to own it in the

233
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:45,040
first place. Across most of human history, ideas were not stolen, only borrowed. We were all free

234
00:23:45,040 --> 00:23:51,760
to sing whatever song and recite whatever story we desired. Then came the age of mass consumption,

235
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:57,040
where we decided to turn all of our favorite stories, songs, and characters into commodities.

236
00:23:57,600 --> 00:24:04,160
We now live in a grim era for creative discretion, where any remotely nuanced ideas ground up and

237
00:24:04,160 --> 00:24:10,240
mass-produced like a fast food assembly line. A character like Mac was borrowed and borrowed

238
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:16,320
and borrowed until all of a sudden it was owned. As of now, nearly every fictional entity that

239
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:22,400
pervades our culture has succumbed to the same fate, just another hopeless cog in the money-making

240
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:29,520
machine. But by some extraordinary cosmic coincidence, Mac was different. It may have been

241
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:36,880
through the ugliest means possible, but by God, we stole Mac back. He was returned to where he always

242
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:43,760
belonged, in the loving hands of the masses. From Captain Mac to Mac the Knife to Mac the Knight and

243
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:50,720
even Moon Man, he has always been destined to live in the public domain. The story of Mac is a

244
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:56,800
remarkable case study in the evolution of media. It speaks to our ability to reimagine and

245
00:24:56,800 --> 00:25:03,200
recontextualize ideas into something entirely different. If there was one thing about Mac that

246
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:08,640
stayed the same throughout his 300 year long transformation, it was that he absolutely stole

247
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:15,600
the show no matter where he wound up, even in a medium as hated as advertising. The truth is,

248
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:21,440
you look around at advertising today, it's all pretty boring. These days it's hard to say what

249
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:28,320
marketing even is anymore. It mostly resembles a murky haze of corporations half-heartedly virtue

250
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:34,160
signaling against the very issues they helped to create. Most people would agree that advertising

251
00:25:34,160 --> 00:25:39,840
today has never been more insufferable. The very same could probably be said about pretty much

252
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:45,200
everything else in the world too. Now, more than ever, we could all benefit from a little bit of

253
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:51,200
nostalgia. And for generations, perhaps no other character has been better at delivering a blast

254
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:56,960
from the past than that surreal singing Moon. No one can predict exactly where and when Mac

255
00:25:56,960 --> 00:26:02,160
will show up next, but if one thing's for sure, we most likely haven't seen the last of him.

256
00:26:02,160 --> 00:26:15,840
So you've been gone for a while. Yeah, you could say that. Three months since the last upload.

257
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:20,240
What exactly have you been up to? Well, to tell you the truth,

258
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:28,400
I've been in a bit of a slump lately. Merchandise sales have been way down and management is

259
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:33,440
starting to get a bit agitated, so I've been traveling around trying to get my mojo back.

260
00:26:34,160 --> 00:26:36,960
So they just let you disappear like that from once at a time?

261
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:44,960
It may seem a little unorthodox, but trust me, it's all part of the process. Any numskull can

262
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:50,480
chug a bunch of caffeine and pump out a list of ideas, but the truly great ideas require a bit

263
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:57,120
more composure. You have to detach your mind from the burdens of everyday life, immerse yourself in

264
00:26:57,120 --> 00:27:02,720
a strange and unfamiliar territory, wander far enough, and you'll find what you're looking for.

265
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:08,720
Seems like a pretty convoluted way to come up with a new shirt design.

266
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:10,560
I hope you at least figured out something good.

267
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:17,840
My journey brought me to some of the greatest creative minds that mankind has ever known.

268
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:24,400
It was there where I studied the ultimate limits of proportion, form, and aesthetic beauty. Then,

269
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:27,600
one moment after soaking it all in, I got it.

270
00:27:29,280 --> 00:27:36,240
And that's how I came up with my greatest t-shirt design yet. I call it Emp tonight.

271
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:41,600
Wait, so your whole spiritual epiphany was to trace over a Mac Tonight poster?

272
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:44,080
What kind of an amateur do you take me for?

273
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:47,920
No, I hired an Indonesian guy on Fiverr and he traced it for me.

274
00:27:48,560 --> 00:27:51,920
You can't be serious. No one's gonna possibly want to buy this.

275
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:58,080
I think you'll find that our focus testing was overwhelmingly positive. So, what do you think?

276
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:03,040
Yeah, I mean, it looks great. Why is Mac Tonight green though?

277
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:08,560
This whole thing is just nonsense. How are people supposed to know what Emp tonight even means?

278
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:14,000
Way ahead of you, buddy. I'm gonna put together an entire video about the detailed history of

279
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:19,920
Mac Tonight. And then, when the viewers are all nice and satisfied, it's time to exit

280
00:28:19,920 --> 00:28:24,880
through the gift shop and say hello to Emp tonight. I don't know. I'm not quite sure if

281
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:31,200
this is the kind of thing your audience is looking for. Come on, this is a good product. I know it is.

282
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:39,680
But the real question is, do you? The new Emp tonight merchandise collection,

283
00:28:39,680 --> 00:28:43,680
now available at crowdmade.com slash emp lemon.

284
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:55,680
Come down to Mac tonight.

285
00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:09,680
Come down to Mac tonight.
