0	5760	Did you know that the average adult has 5 to 20 pounds of toxic poop in their body at any given moment?
6760	9600	Ads. We see them every day.
9600	13760	And when we do, it's almost always against our will.
13760	18480	The average American is exposed to at least 5,000 ads per day.
18480	23360	If given the choice, most of us would probably prefer to see zero.
23360	29760	It turns out that most people don't like being interrupted every five seconds by a manipulative sales pitch.
29760	34960	Any sane individual would be far better off avoiding ads whenever possible.
34960	38560	It's for this reason that marketing is such a tall order.
38560	43040	How do you make people pay attention to something that no one wants to see?
43040	49920	Out of the 5,000 ads we see per day, how many do we even register as anything more than white noise?
49920	53840	The vast majority of marketing campaigns are utterly forgettable.
53840	59680	And the handful of ads that actually managed to stand out usually do so for the wrong reasons.
59680	65840	However, once in a blue moon, we'll encounter an ad that extraordinarily beats the odds.
65840	70960	One that we remember for long after whatever they were selling ceased to exist.
70960	77120	In 1986, America's most powerful restaurant empire deployed a marketing campaign so brilliant
77120	81680	that it still has a place in our culture more than 35 years later.
81680	88560	But the full story of one of advertising's most timeless mascots goes back a bit further than 35 years.
88560	96480	It all began with an Englishman by the name of John Gay, who in 1728 would unveil the play of the century.
96480	101440	The Beggar's Opera was a theatrical performance unlike anything else in its time.
101440	105520	It was an opera that set out to make a mockery of opera itself.
105520	108560	It not only ridiculed the conventions of the medium,
108560	113600	but served as an irreverent critique of the aristocratic world it often glorified.
113600	118080	The Beggar's Opera was one of the first definitive examples of counterculture,
118080	124000	one that satirized issues of wealth and corruption among England's most powerful institutions.
124000	130480	The show was beloved by audiences and essentially became the first opera to belong to the common man.
130480	136320	This resounding success was due in large part to the play's main character, Captain MacHeath.
136320	142800	Considered by some to be one of literature's first anti-heroes, portrayed as a womanizing thief,
142800	147120	MacHeath was a character of questionable virtue and undeniable passion.
147120	151840	One who succeeded in winning over the audience despite his inherent vices.
151840	155760	The Beggar's Opera was the most revolutionary play of its time
155760	161040	and would go on to inspire a whole new genre of satirical comedy in theater.
161040	167280	Just four years after releasing his magnum opus, John Gay would pass away at the age of 47,
167280	170720	never to know what would eventually become of his creation.
170720	174480	While his story had ended, Captain Mac's had only just begun.
178480	183520	Two hundred years later, the Beggar's Opera would experience a revival in Germany.
183520	187360	The play would be retooled by Marxist playwright Bertolt Brecht,
187360	190640	who intended to punctuate its anti-capitalist themes.
191280	196160	Now renamed to the Three-Penny Opera, the show would once again captivate the masses.
196800	202480	Captain Mac would return to his leading role, now wielding a far more unsavory demeanor.
203040	208880	This darker version of the character would henceforth be known by another name, Mac the Knife.
208880	213040	The new moniker quickly caught on thanks to an unexpected addition to the play.
213840	218720	Shortly before the premiere, lead actor Harold Paulson threatened to walk out of the production
218720	222000	unless his character received a special introduction.
222000	227280	With very little time to spare, composer Kurt Wheel quickly devised what would become
227280	232400	the most iconic musical number of the entire play, The Ballad of Mac the Knife.
238720	243200	A song that depicts Mac as a serial killer who stabs his victims to death
243200	244960	and dumps their bodies in the river.
245520	249280	You might be thinking that this far more sinister version of the character
249280	254720	would have made him somewhat unpopular, but as fate would have it, the exact opposite was true.
255600	260560	After its successful debut in Germany, the Three-Penny Opera would soon be translated
260560	263200	and performed in numerous other countries.
263200	267040	By the 1950s, the play had arrived in the United States,
267040	270080	where it began a six-year run as an off-Broadway show.
270720	276560	At around the same time, musicians began recording their own versions of the play's defining song.
277200	283120	Louis Armstrong's 1955 cover of Mac the Knife established the tune as a jazz staple.
283120	287440	Over the years, more than a dozen artists would put their own spin on the song,
287440	292960	but by far the most enduring version would be the one released by Bobby Darin in 1959.
293600	296880	Bobby Darin singing Mac the Knife. Let's have a nice hand for him.
305680	309760	The single rocketed to the top of the charts in the US and UK,
309760	313040	cementing Mac the Knife as an international phenomenon.
313600	317840	Darin's big hit resembled the popular genre of crooner music,
317840	323680	songs characterized by a smooth soft-spoken male singer paired with big band jazz instrumentals.
324400	330320	The style was most closely associated with performers like Frank Sinatra and Bing Crosby,
330320	334640	two figures who are inseparable from 20th century Americana.
334640	338880	But considering the sanitized culture of 1950s America,
338880	344160	it's unusual how something as dark as Mac the Knife wound up being such a mainstream hit.
344800	348480	In a time when you weren't allowed to show a toilet on TV,
348480	353120	it's somewhat shocking to consider that one of its most popular songs happened to be about
353120	359440	a serial killer. Just like the case with nearly all pop music today, most listeners just never
359440	365120	pay attention to the lyrics. With that being said, it's not a stretch to suggest that Mac
365120	368880	the Knife was essentially the pumped up kicks of the boomer generation.
374160	378320	Sing Mac the Knife. And because he wanted to hang out with us, he'd belt it right out.
383600	389360	In just 30 years, the song had reached unimaginable heights from its humble German origin.
389360	394800	And coincidentally, at around the same time, a certain other German creation would also
394800	400080	experience a meteoric rise in the United States. At the turn of the 20th century,
400080	405840	a new food item was quickly picking up steam in the American cuisine. The delicacy was thought
405840	411040	to have been brought over by immigrants originating from Hamburg, Germany. Of course,
411040	416480	this exciting new sandwich would soon become known as the hamburger. And throughout the history of
416480	422560	the American diet, no other food would be more influential. The success of the hamburger had
422560	428480	to do with two key advantages. It was a hearty meal that could be prepared very quickly and very
428480	435840	cheaply. The founding tenets of America's most famous industry, fast food. In 1961,
435840	440160	businessman Ray Kroc completed what was essentially a hostile takeover of the
440160	445760	McDonald brothers and their chain of California restaurants. Under his leadership, McDonald's
445760	451920	would revolutionize the American food industry with one simple vision. The idea that a customer
451920	457360	could visit any restaurant in the country and order an identical sandwich. After a decade of
457360	463520	aggressive expansion, the golden arches would span from sea to shining sea. McDonald's had
463520	469520	become one of the first truly national brands in America. The new fast food empire ushered in
469520	478320	a new era of commerce and along with it, a new challenge in marketing. Sell me this pen.
480560	486800	Compared to other disciplines, advertising is relatively new. The practice only began to be
486800	492480	seriously studied at around the turn of the 20th century. But while research into the field may
492480	498720	still be quite young, it all seeks to answer the same age-old question. Both the art and the
498720	505440	science of advertising exist to figure out what people want. Selling a product requires so much
505440	511200	more than simply making people aware of its existence. The power of marketing relies on
511200	517680	infiltrating the gooey center of human desire. It attempts to deliver us our grandest fantasies,
517680	524000	to exploit our deepest fears and insecurities. The purpose of advertising is not to give people
524000	530560	what they want, but to redefine the meaning of want. Most products and services in the economy
530560	536720	are totally superfluous. They offer the customer no intrinsic value versus any replacement level
536720	542960	item. It is the job of the advertiser to manufacture that value, to convince the customer
542960	549120	that a product is more than a product. And perhaps no other company understood this concept more than
549120	554960	McDonald's, which sought to brand itself as not just a restaurant, but an American institution.
555520	560560	McDonald's prospered by getting working-class families out of their dining rooms and into their
560560	567440	restaurants. The golden arches came to symbolize an oasis of comfort and familiarity. No matter
567440	574160	how far you were from home, you were never too far from a McDonald's. Across the 60s and 70s,
574160	579200	McDonald's marketing acumen brought them tremendous success. Success which quickly
579200	585600	drew in competitors. And soon enough, the franchise had several challengers to their fast food throne.
586400	592480	The 1980s were truly a landmark time in advertising as newly titanic brands fought for
592480	598240	control over a nation of consumers. The marketing battles fought during this time period would
598240	604240	dictate the industry leaders of the 21st century. Companies could see that valuable market share was
604240	610640	up for grabs based solely on their ability to sell to the American people. As the dominant force in
610640	616400	fast food, McDonald's quickly found themselves with a target on their back. All of a sudden,
616400	621360	the franchise was under fire from an onslaught of commercials attacking both the quality and
621360	628000	quantity of their products. McDonald's was thrust into an advertising arms race, spending millions
628000	634080	on radical new campaigns of their own. However, despite their best efforts to subdue their rivals,
634080	638720	the company was still losing ground. In order to protect themselves from the pandemic,
638880	644560	they had to start thinking outside the box. Fortunately for McDonald's, an unexpected flash
644560	647840	of inspiration would come from their biggest business partner.
649040	653440	Hi, Max Headroom here with... this is my guest.
654080	659920	In 1985, Coca-Cola was looking to regain momentum following the rocky launch of New Coke.
660720	664560	They would find a rather unorthodox solution in Max Headroom,
664560	669440	an obscure experimental character who had recently sprung up on the British airwaves.
670000	674800	The virtual talking head replaced Bill Cosby as Coca-Cola's spokesperson,
674800	681600	a change that was met with massive success. Coke had proven the value of manufacturing a cult icon,
682160	688640	inspiring McDonald's to brainstorm a character of their own. Like many great creative minds before
688720	694160	them, they decided to borrow from the past. And in the winter of 1986,
694160	697120	America would be introduced to Mac Tonight.
718640	744720	For the fourth time in his long and convoluted history, Mac was once again on top of the world.
745280	750640	McDonald's had deployed a variety of corporate mascots before, but none moved the needle quite
750640	756880	like Mac. It was an ad campaign unlike any other in the company's history. The anthropomorphic
756880	763600	crescent moon was a surreal window into the soul of American enterprise. It was bold, decadent,
763600	770720	and idealistic. A perfect marriage of nostalgia and pure fantasy. For the fast food eating public,
770720	775600	Mac Tonight truly delivered something old, something new, something borrowed, and something
775600	782000	blue. While conceiving the ad, marketing executive Brad Ball and director Peter Katrolis sought to
782000	787520	create a veritable Micktopia. The hand-built miniatures and practical costume work gives
787520	793200	Mac Tonight an otherworldly aesthetic. A parallel reality where McDonald's has single-handedly
793200	799440	ushered in a new epoch of human advancement. A glorious vision of a society that had long since
799440	805600	transcended its struggles with crime, poverty, and especially hunger. It was the greasy,
805600	812880	delicious future that all of us needed, but none of us deserved. For Los Angeles marketing firm DMJC,
812880	818720	it was lightning in a bottle. What was originally planned as a regional campaign quickly expanded
818720	824400	nationwide. The ad made a huge impression on consumers, with some stores reporting more than
824400	830320	a 10 percent increase in dinnertime business. McDonald's brand recognition skyrocketed,
830320	834240	giving the franchise the boost it needed to pull away from its competitors.
844240	849280	The character of Mac Tonight was so popular that scheduled meet and greets would draw on over a
849280	855760	thousand visitors from LA to Boca Raton. Over the next three years, actor and contortionist Doug
855760	861680	Jones would strap into the moon costume for 25 more commercials. The popularity of the campaign
861680	867120	would mark a turning point in his career. Today he is best known for his leading role of the
867120	873200	amphibian man in academy award-winning film The Shape of Water. It seemed that no matter where or
873200	879600	when Mac appeared, roaring success was sure to follow. By the end of the 80s, he was basking on
879600	885600	cloud nine, lifting a fast food empire and its investors all the way to the moon. But in the
885600	892400	midst of the company's greatest marketing campaign to date, not all was well in McDonaldland. By
892400	898640	becoming the face of the franchise, Mac had strayed a bit too far from his roots. The character was
898640	904480	originally conceived as a critique of wealth and capitalism, only to eventually wind up as the
904480	910720	mascot for the most capitalistic company on the planet. The once iconoclastic Captain Mac had
910720	916480	effectively sold out, and unfortunately for him, the pendulum was about to swing in the other
916480	921840	direction. As fate would have it, the corporate gravy train that he now represented would soon
921840	925760	betray him, as Mac Tonight was sacrificed for the system.
929760	936400	In October 1989, Dodd-Darren filed a 10 million dollar lawsuit against McDonald's claiming that
936400	942800	Mac Tonight had infringed on his father's song. At face value, it looked like a pretty nonsensical
942800	949600	confrontation. Bobby Darin had passed away more than 15 years earlier, and his defining single
949600	955360	wasn't exactly the most original composition. He didn't write the lyrics, he wasn't the first
955360	961440	to perform the song, he hadn't single-handedly invented the crooner style. Like many works
961440	966800	involving Mac, it was derivative content that just so happened to be in the right place at the right
966800	973440	time. It's hard to say what Bobby Darin even owned that McDonald's could have possibly infringed upon,
973440	979760	but due to the oppressive nature of our wonderful copyright system, not even Fortune 500 companies
979760	985600	are exempt from getting pushed around by frivolous greed. Had McDonald's fought the lawsuit, they
985600	991200	could have very easily won, but they decided that the legal expense was simply not worth the trouble
991200	996880	to save an ad campaign that had pretty much run its course. With very little to gain in court,
996960	1004320	McDonald's chose to bite the bullet. And so, after nearly four years of service, Mac Tonight's golden
1004320	1010080	run on the airwaves would come to an abrupt end. Who would have thought that after all this time,
1010080	1014000	Mac finally got to experience what it was like to get stabbed in the back?
1016960	1022080	While their fallen mascot was no longer allowed to perform his signature jingles,
1022080	1027680	McDonald's wouldn't entirely give up on Mac Tonight. Starting in the 90s, they would install
1027680	1033920	several Mac animatronics which played retro hits in stores across the country. During this time,
1033920	1041280	Mac would still occasionally appear in commercials, including a brief campaign in 1997. That year would
1041280	1048000	also see Mac make his debut in NASCAR, appearing as a select sponsor on Bill Elliott's number 94
1048000	1055600	Ford. In 2007, 20 years after his national debut, a CG Mac would suddenly resurface on the
1055600	1062320	international market, announcing the opening of 24-hour locations in Southeast Asia. But beyond
1062320	1068480	these sparse sightings, Mac Tonight was essentially retired, left to ride off into the sunset as a
1068480	1075200	marketing martyr and a hamburger hero. An ending that was a little too good to be true. By
1075200	1081040	transforming Mac into the perfect company mascot, McDonald's had to omit the character's more
1081040	1087920	distasteful attributes. It was a character who was never designed to be a hero, and one who had spent
1087920	1094560	the past two decades running from the sins of his past. The truth is that Mac had built his legacy
1094560	1100960	not through fame, but through notoriety. In a shocking turn of events, everyone would be rudely
1100960	1111840	reminded about the dark side of the moon. In the mid-2000s, the internet revolution was in full
1111840	1118960	swing. A popular site at the time was the online community YTM&D, a place where users could create
1118960	1124800	their own web pages with looping images and audio. The site quickly became a prominent spawning
1124800	1131440	ground for various memes and subcultures, and in the Wild West era of online moderation, practically
1131440	1138000	nothing was off limits. Possibly the most infamous series of events to ever come out of YTM&D just
1138000	1144720	so happened to involve a certain McDonald's mascot. Users had begun posting gifs of Mac Tonight as
1144720	1151280	early as 2006, but the character's downward descent into degeneracy would truly begin in the spring of
1151360	1159200	2007, all due to an individual by the name of Farkle. Starting in June, he created several sites
1159200	1165840	combining Mac Tonight with AT&T Mike, a text-to-speech bot that could be made to say anything the user
1165840	1172240	desired. As is the case with many things on the internet, what began as simply goofing around
1172240	1178400	quickly devolved into something very profane and very offensive. Farkle's site soon inspired a
1178400	1183920	variety of imitators looking to make their own twisted interpretations of the once family-friendly
1183920	1190400	character. This heinous new alter ego of Mac Tonight came to be known by a different moniker,
1190400	1197440	Moonman, a name that would live on in infamy. It started with a few racially insensitive chants
1197440	1202720	and quickly escalated to full-blown song covers advocating for crimes against humanity.
1203360	1208000	Some of these songs were so hideously obscene that they have since been expunged from all
1208000	1214400	but the grittiest corners of the web. As the meme grew in notoriety, so too did the scope of its
1214400	1221040	contributors. In 2008, several of the most prolific Moonman posters would form a faction known as the
1221040	1227680	Moon Crew, a collection of users dedicated to the advancement of their new lunar overlord. Together,
1227680	1232800	they would help establish a sophisticated lore around the character, which was unofficially
1232800	1238320	referred to as the Mooniverse. In the following months, the Moon Crew would amass dozens of
1238320	1244240	members who made themselves known as a nuisance to the entire platform. Moonman sites were being
1244240	1250160	created with such abundance that they began to draw the attention of outside forces. During this
1250160	1255440	time, many of the most popular Moonman edits would be frequently re-uploaded to YouTube,
1255440	1263040	a platform with far stricter rules than YTM&D. Due to the extremely vulgar content of the genre,
1263040	1268240	most of the YouTube uploads wouldn't last long before getting flagged and removed for community
1268240	1274240	guidelines violations. But despite their short lifespans, the sheer amount of traffic on YouTube
1274240	1279120	meant that it was the most visible place for the public to discover the shocking fate of the fast
1279120	1285600	food legend. Evidently, McDonald's and AT&T must have received some complaints over the meme,
1285600	1291600	with McDonald's issuing copyright strikes and AT&T banning the term Moonman from their text-to-speech
1291600	1298960	service. Even YTM&D attempted to ban the Moon Crew from the platform, but with limitless accounts
1298960	1304800	at their disposal, they could stick around for as long as they pleased. Despite their best efforts
1304800	1311360	to quell the movement, the downfall of Mac Tonight could not be stopped. Moonman was not going
1311360	1317680	anywhere, and for a new generation who had never seen Mac Tonight, it was the only version of him
1317680	1324320	they ever knew. The racist megalomaniac would persist into the next decade, where he eventually
1324320	1331440	reprised his former role as a mascot, this time representing 4chan's politically incorrect board.
1331440	1338640	And in 2019, the meme was officially inducted into the Anti-Defamation League's list of hate symbols,
1338640	1344480	an ugly ending to one of the most beloved characters of all time. Following the controversial
1344480	1350720	turn, McDonald's would distance itself from their former marketing juggernaut. Nearly all of the
1350720	1356640	Mac Tonight statues and animatronics have since been dismantled, and the character has remained
1356640	1363360	absent from any official promotional material since 2010. Possibly the last remaining artifact
1363360	1368160	of Mac's glorious reign can be found sitting high up in the rafters at the Entertainment
1368160	1374080	McDonald's in Orlando, Florida. Oh Mac, where did we go so wrong?
1378720	1383120	Mac Tonight's precipitous fall from grace may have been painful to watch,
1383120	1387680	but oddly enough, it helped the character achieve something that very few others could.
1388400	1394000	When you look back at the very beginning of Mac's journey, he was created to illustrate one essential
1394000	1400400	conflict, the struggle of the masses versus the rich and powerful. The beggar's opera told the
1400400	1406080	tale of an unrepentant thief, one who was no less virtuous than the system which outlawed him.
1406720	1411440	It made a bold statement that the only difference between a thief and an aristocrat is the number
1411440	1417600	of zeros in their bank account. Before anything can be stolen, we must choose to own it in the
1417600	1425040	first place. Across most of human history, ideas were not stolen, only borrowed. We were all free
1425040	1431760	to sing whatever song and recite whatever story we desired. Then came the age of mass consumption,
1431760	1437040	where we decided to turn all of our favorite stories, songs, and characters into commodities.
1437600	1444160	We now live in a grim era for creative discretion, where any remotely nuanced ideas ground up and
1444160	1450240	mass-produced like a fast food assembly line. A character like Mac was borrowed and borrowed
1450240	1456320	and borrowed until all of a sudden it was owned. As of now, nearly every fictional entity that
1456320	1462400	pervades our culture has succumbed to the same fate, just another hopeless cog in the money-making
1462400	1469520	machine. But by some extraordinary cosmic coincidence, Mac was different. It may have been
1469520	1476880	through the ugliest means possible, but by God, we stole Mac back. He was returned to where he always
1476880	1483760	belonged, in the loving hands of the masses. From Captain Mac to Mac the Knife to Mac the Knight and
1483760	1490720	even Moon Man, he has always been destined to live in the public domain. The story of Mac is a
1490720	1496800	remarkable case study in the evolution of media. It speaks to our ability to reimagine and
1496800	1503200	recontextualize ideas into something entirely different. If there was one thing about Mac that
1503200	1508640	stayed the same throughout his 300 year long transformation, it was that he absolutely stole
1508640	1515600	the show no matter where he wound up, even in a medium as hated as advertising. The truth is,
1515600	1521440	you look around at advertising today, it's all pretty boring. These days it's hard to say what
1521440	1528320	marketing even is anymore. It mostly resembles a murky haze of corporations half-heartedly virtue
1528320	1534160	signaling against the very issues they helped to create. Most people would agree that advertising
1534160	1539840	today has never been more insufferable. The very same could probably be said about pretty much
1539840	1545200	everything else in the world too. Now, more than ever, we could all benefit from a little bit of
1545200	1551200	nostalgia. And for generations, perhaps no other character has been better at delivering a blast
1551200	1556960	from the past than that surreal singing Moon. No one can predict exactly where and when Mac
1556960	1562160	will show up next, but if one thing's for sure, we most likely haven't seen the last of him.
1562160	1575840	So you've been gone for a while. Yeah, you could say that. Three months since the last upload.
1575840	1580240	What exactly have you been up to? Well, to tell you the truth,
1582880	1588400	I've been in a bit of a slump lately. Merchandise sales have been way down and management is
1588400	1593440	starting to get a bit agitated, so I've been traveling around trying to get my mojo back.
1594160	1596960	So they just let you disappear like that from once at a time?
1597600	1604960	It may seem a little unorthodox, but trust me, it's all part of the process. Any numskull can
1604960	1610480	chug a bunch of caffeine and pump out a list of ideas, but the truly great ideas require a bit
1610480	1617120	more composure. You have to detach your mind from the burdens of everyday life, immerse yourself in
1617120	1622720	a strange and unfamiliar territory, wander far enough, and you'll find what you're looking for.
1625520	1628720	Seems like a pretty convoluted way to come up with a new shirt design.
1628720	1630560	I hope you at least figured out something good.
1633200	1637840	My journey brought me to some of the greatest creative minds that mankind has ever known.
1638400	1644400	It was there where I studied the ultimate limits of proportion, form, and aesthetic beauty. Then,
1644480	1647600	one moment after soaking it all in, I got it.
1649280	1656240	And that's how I came up with my greatest t-shirt design yet. I call it Emp tonight.
1657120	1661600	Wait, so your whole spiritual epiphany was to trace over a Mac Tonight poster?
1661600	1664080	What kind of an amateur do you take me for?
1664080	1667920	No, I hired an Indonesian guy on Fiverr and he traced it for me.
1668560	1671920	You can't be serious. No one's gonna possibly want to buy this.
1671920	1678080	I think you'll find that our focus testing was overwhelmingly positive. So, what do you think?
1679600	1683040	Yeah, I mean, it looks great. Why is Mac Tonight green though?
1683760	1688560	This whole thing is just nonsense. How are people supposed to know what Emp tonight even means?
1689120	1694000	Way ahead of you, buddy. I'm gonna put together an entire video about the detailed history of
1694000	1699920	Mac Tonight. And then, when the viewers are all nice and satisfied, it's time to exit
1699920	1704880	through the gift shop and say hello to Emp tonight. I don't know. I'm not quite sure if
1704880	1711200	this is the kind of thing your audience is looking for. Come on, this is a good product. I know it is.
1711200	1719680	But the real question is, do you? The new Emp tonight merchandise collection,
1719680	1723680	now available at crowdmade.com slash emp lemon.
1730880	1735680	Come down to Mac tonight.
1746320	1749680	Come down to Mac tonight.
