00:00.000 --> 00:05.760
Did you know that the average adult has 5 to 20 pounds of toxic poop in their body at any given moment?

00:06.760 --> 00:09.600
Ads. We see them every day.

00:09.600 --> 00:13.760
And when we do, it's almost always against our will.

00:13.760 --> 00:18.480
The average American is exposed to at least 5,000 ads per day.

00:18.480 --> 00:23.360
If given the choice, most of us would probably prefer to see zero.

00:23.360 --> 00:29.760
It turns out that most people don't like being interrupted every five seconds by a manipulative sales pitch.

00:29.760 --> 00:34.960
Any sane individual would be far better off avoiding ads whenever possible.

00:34.960 --> 00:38.560
It's for this reason that marketing is such a tall order.

00:38.560 --> 00:43.040
How do you make people pay attention to something that no one wants to see?

00:43.040 --> 00:49.920
Out of the 5,000 ads we see per day, how many do we even register as anything more than white noise?

00:49.920 --> 00:53.840
The vast majority of marketing campaigns are utterly forgettable.

00:53.840 --> 00:59.680
And the handful of ads that actually managed to stand out usually do so for the wrong reasons.

00:59.680 --> 01:05.840
However, once in a blue moon, we'll encounter an ad that extraordinarily beats the odds.

01:05.840 --> 01:10.960
One that we remember for long after whatever they were selling ceased to exist.

01:10.960 --> 01:17.120
In 1986, America's most powerful restaurant empire deployed a marketing campaign so brilliant

01:17.120 --> 01:21.680
that it still has a place in our culture more than 35 years later.

01:21.680 --> 01:28.560
But the full story of one of advertising's most timeless mascots goes back a bit further than 35 years.

01:28.560 --> 01:36.480
It all began with an Englishman by the name of John Gay, who in 1728 would unveil the play of the century.

01:36.480 --> 01:41.440
The Beggar's Opera was a theatrical performance unlike anything else in its time.

01:41.440 --> 01:45.520
It was an opera that set out to make a mockery of opera itself.

01:45.520 --> 01:48.560
It not only ridiculed the conventions of the medium,

01:48.560 --> 01:53.600
but served as an irreverent critique of the aristocratic world it often glorified.

01:53.600 --> 01:58.080
The Beggar's Opera was one of the first definitive examples of counterculture,

01:58.080 --> 02:04.000
one that satirized issues of wealth and corruption among England's most powerful institutions.

02:04.000 --> 02:10.480
The show was beloved by audiences and essentially became the first opera to belong to the common man.

02:10.480 --> 02:16.320
This resounding success was due in large part to the play's main character, Captain MacHeath.

02:16.320 --> 02:22.800
Considered by some to be one of literature's first anti-heroes, portrayed as a womanizing thief,

02:22.800 --> 02:27.120
MacHeath was a character of questionable virtue and undeniable passion.

02:27.120 --> 02:31.840
One who succeeded in winning over the audience despite his inherent vices.

02:31.840 --> 02:35.760
The Beggar's Opera was the most revolutionary play of its time

02:35.760 --> 02:41.040
and would go on to inspire a whole new genre of satirical comedy in theater.

02:41.040 --> 02:47.280
Just four years after releasing his magnum opus, John Gay would pass away at the age of 47,

02:47.280 --> 02:50.720
never to know what would eventually become of his creation.

02:50.720 --> 02:54.480
While his story had ended, Captain Mac's had only just begun.

02:58.480 --> 03:03.520
Two hundred years later, the Beggar's Opera would experience a revival in Germany.

03:03.520 --> 03:07.360
The play would be retooled by Marxist playwright Bertolt Brecht,

03:07.360 --> 03:10.640
who intended to punctuate its anti-capitalist themes.

03:11.280 --> 03:16.160
Now renamed to the Three-Penny Opera, the show would once again captivate the masses.

03:16.800 --> 03:22.480
Captain Mac would return to his leading role, now wielding a far more unsavory demeanor.

03:23.040 --> 03:28.880
This darker version of the character would henceforth be known by another name, Mac the Knife.

03:28.880 --> 03:33.040
The new moniker quickly caught on thanks to an unexpected addition to the play.

03:33.840 --> 03:38.720
Shortly before the premiere, lead actor Harold Paulson threatened to walk out of the production

03:38.720 --> 03:42.000
unless his character received a special introduction.

03:42.000 --> 03:47.280
With very little time to spare, composer Kurt Wheel quickly devised what would become

03:47.280 --> 03:52.400
the most iconic musical number of the entire play, The Ballad of Mac the Knife.

03:58.720 --> 04:03.200
A song that depicts Mac as a serial killer who stabs his victims to death

04:03.200 --> 04:04.960
and dumps their bodies in the river.

04:05.520 --> 04:09.280
You might be thinking that this far more sinister version of the character

04:09.280 --> 04:14.720
would have made him somewhat unpopular, but as fate would have it, the exact opposite was true.

04:15.600 --> 04:20.560
After its successful debut in Germany, the Three-Penny Opera would soon be translated

04:20.560 --> 04:23.200
and performed in numerous other countries.

04:23.200 --> 04:27.040
By the 1950s, the play had arrived in the United States,

04:27.040 --> 04:30.080
where it began a six-year run as an off-Broadway show.

04:30.720 --> 04:36.560
At around the same time, musicians began recording their own versions of the play's defining song.

04:37.200 --> 04:43.120
Louis Armstrong's 1955 cover of Mac the Knife established the tune as a jazz staple.

04:43.120 --> 04:47.440
Over the years, more than a dozen artists would put their own spin on the song,

04:47.440 --> 04:52.960
but by far the most enduring version would be the one released by Bobby Darin in 1959.

04:53.600 --> 04:56.880
Bobby Darin singing Mac the Knife. Let's have a nice hand for him.

05:05.680 --> 05:09.760
The single rocketed to the top of the charts in the US and UK,

05:09.760 --> 05:13.040
cementing Mac the Knife as an international phenomenon.

05:13.600 --> 05:17.840
Darin's big hit resembled the popular genre of crooner music,

05:17.840 --> 05:23.680
songs characterized by a smooth soft-spoken male singer paired with big band jazz instrumentals.

05:24.400 --> 05:30.320
The style was most closely associated with performers like Frank Sinatra and Bing Crosby,

05:30.320 --> 05:34.640
two figures who are inseparable from 20th century Americana.

05:34.640 --> 05:38.880
But considering the sanitized culture of 1950s America,

05:38.880 --> 05:44.160
it's unusual how something as dark as Mac the Knife wound up being such a mainstream hit.

05:44.800 --> 05:48.480
In a time when you weren't allowed to show a toilet on TV,

05:48.480 --> 05:53.120
it's somewhat shocking to consider that one of its most popular songs happened to be about

05:53.120 --> 05:59.440
a serial killer. Just like the case with nearly all pop music today, most listeners just never

05:59.440 --> 06:05.120
pay attention to the lyrics. With that being said, it's not a stretch to suggest that Mac

06:05.120 --> 06:08.880
the Knife was essentially the pumped up kicks of the boomer generation.

06:14.160 --> 06:18.320
Sing Mac the Knife. And because he wanted to hang out with us, he'd belt it right out.

06:23.600 --> 06:29.360
In just 30 years, the song had reached unimaginable heights from its humble German origin.

06:29.360 --> 06:34.800
And coincidentally, at around the same time, a certain other German creation would also

06:34.800 --> 06:40.080
experience a meteoric rise in the United States. At the turn of the 20th century,

06:40.080 --> 06:45.840
a new food item was quickly picking up steam in the American cuisine. The delicacy was thought

06:45.840 --> 06:51.040
to have been brought over by immigrants originating from Hamburg, Germany. Of course,

06:51.040 --> 06:56.480
this exciting new sandwich would soon become known as the hamburger. And throughout the history of

06:56.480 --> 07:02.560
the American diet, no other food would be more influential. The success of the hamburger had

07:02.560 --> 07:08.480
to do with two key advantages. It was a hearty meal that could be prepared very quickly and very

07:08.480 --> 07:15.840
cheaply. The founding tenets of America's most famous industry, fast food. In 1961,

07:15.840 --> 07:20.160
businessman Ray Kroc completed what was essentially a hostile takeover of the

07:20.160 --> 07:25.760
McDonald brothers and their chain of California restaurants. Under his leadership, McDonald's

07:25.760 --> 07:31.920
would revolutionize the American food industry with one simple vision. The idea that a customer

07:31.920 --> 07:37.360
could visit any restaurant in the country and order an identical sandwich. After a decade of

07:37.360 --> 07:43.520
aggressive expansion, the golden arches would span from sea to shining sea. McDonald's had

07:43.520 --> 07:49.520
become one of the first truly national brands in America. The new fast food empire ushered in

07:49.520 --> 07:58.320
a new era of commerce and along with it, a new challenge in marketing. Sell me this pen.

08:00.560 --> 08:06.800
Compared to other disciplines, advertising is relatively new. The practice only began to be

08:06.800 --> 08:12.480
seriously studied at around the turn of the 20th century. But while research into the field may

08:12.480 --> 08:18.720
still be quite young, it all seeks to answer the same age-old question. Both the art and the

08:18.720 --> 08:25.440
science of advertising exist to figure out what people want. Selling a product requires so much

08:25.440 --> 08:31.200
more than simply making people aware of its existence. The power of marketing relies on

08:31.200 --> 08:37.680
infiltrating the gooey center of human desire. It attempts to deliver us our grandest fantasies,

08:37.680 --> 08:44.000
to exploit our deepest fears and insecurities. The purpose of advertising is not to give people

08:44.000 --> 08:50.560
what they want, but to redefine the meaning of want. Most products and services in the economy

08:50.560 --> 08:56.720
are totally superfluous. They offer the customer no intrinsic value versus any replacement level

08:56.720 --> 09:02.960
item. It is the job of the advertiser to manufacture that value, to convince the customer

09:02.960 --> 09:09.120
that a product is more than a product. And perhaps no other company understood this concept more than

09:09.120 --> 09:14.960
McDonald's, which sought to brand itself as not just a restaurant, but an American institution.

09:15.520 --> 09:20.560
McDonald's prospered by getting working-class families out of their dining rooms and into their

09:20.560 --> 09:27.440
restaurants. The golden arches came to symbolize an oasis of comfort and familiarity. No matter

09:27.440 --> 09:34.160
how far you were from home, you were never too far from a McDonald's. Across the 60s and 70s,

09:34.160 --> 09:39.200
McDonald's marketing acumen brought them tremendous success. Success which quickly

09:39.200 --> 09:45.600
drew in competitors. And soon enough, the franchise had several challengers to their fast food throne.

09:46.400 --> 09:52.480
The 1980s were truly a landmark time in advertising as newly titanic brands fought for

09:52.480 --> 09:58.240
control over a nation of consumers. The marketing battles fought during this time period would

09:58.240 --> 10:04.240
dictate the industry leaders of the 21st century. Companies could see that valuable market share was

10:04.240 --> 10:10.640
up for grabs based solely on their ability to sell to the American people. As the dominant force in

10:10.640 --> 10:16.400
fast food, McDonald's quickly found themselves with a target on their back. All of a sudden,

10:16.400 --> 10:21.360
the franchise was under fire from an onslaught of commercials attacking both the quality and

10:21.360 --> 10:28.000
quantity of their products. McDonald's was thrust into an advertising arms race, spending millions

10:28.000 --> 10:34.080
on radical new campaigns of their own. However, despite their best efforts to subdue their rivals,

10:34.080 --> 10:38.720
the company was still losing ground. In order to protect themselves from the pandemic,

10:38.880 --> 10:44.560
they had to start thinking outside the box. Fortunately for McDonald's, an unexpected flash

10:44.560 --> 10:47.840
of inspiration would come from their biggest business partner.

10:49.040 --> 10:53.440
Hi, Max Headroom here with... this is my guest.

10:54.080 --> 10:59.920
In 1985, Coca-Cola was looking to regain momentum following the rocky launch of New Coke.

11:00.720 --> 11:04.560
They would find a rather unorthodox solution in Max Headroom,

11:04.560 --> 11:09.440
an obscure experimental character who had recently sprung up on the British airwaves.

11:10.000 --> 11:14.800
The virtual talking head replaced Bill Cosby as Coca-Cola's spokesperson,

11:14.800 --> 11:21.600
a change that was met with massive success. Coke had proven the value of manufacturing a cult icon,

11:22.160 --> 11:28.640
inspiring McDonald's to brainstorm a character of their own. Like many great creative minds before

11:28.720 --> 11:34.160
them, they decided to borrow from the past. And in the winter of 1986,

11:34.160 --> 11:37.120
America would be introduced to Mac Tonight.

11:58.640 --> 12:24.720
For the fourth time in his long and convoluted history, Mac was once again on top of the world.

12:25.280 --> 12:30.640
McDonald's had deployed a variety of corporate mascots before, but none moved the needle quite

12:30.640 --> 12:36.880
like Mac. It was an ad campaign unlike any other in the company's history. The anthropomorphic

12:36.880 --> 12:43.600
crescent moon was a surreal window into the soul of American enterprise. It was bold, decadent,

12:43.600 --> 12:50.720
and idealistic. A perfect marriage of nostalgia and pure fantasy. For the fast food eating public,

12:50.720 --> 12:55.600
Mac Tonight truly delivered something old, something new, something borrowed, and something

12:55.600 --> 13:02.000
blue. While conceiving the ad, marketing executive Brad Ball and director Peter Katrolis sought to

13:02.000 --> 13:07.520
create a veritable Micktopia. The hand-built miniatures and practical costume work gives

13:07.520 --> 13:13.200
Mac Tonight an otherworldly aesthetic. A parallel reality where McDonald's has single-handedly

13:13.200 --> 13:19.440
ushered in a new epoch of human advancement. A glorious vision of a society that had long since

13:19.440 --> 13:25.600
transcended its struggles with crime, poverty, and especially hunger. It was the greasy,

13:25.600 --> 13:32.880
delicious future that all of us needed, but none of us deserved. For Los Angeles marketing firm DMJC,

13:32.880 --> 13:38.720
it was lightning in a bottle. What was originally planned as a regional campaign quickly expanded

13:38.720 --> 13:44.400
nationwide. The ad made a huge impression on consumers, with some stores reporting more than

13:44.400 --> 13:50.320
a 10 percent increase in dinnertime business. McDonald's brand recognition skyrocketed,

13:50.320 --> 13:54.240
giving the franchise the boost it needed to pull away from its competitors.

14:04.240 --> 14:09.280
The character of Mac Tonight was so popular that scheduled meet and greets would draw on over a

14:09.280 --> 14:15.760
thousand visitors from LA to Boca Raton. Over the next three years, actor and contortionist Doug

14:15.760 --> 14:21.680
Jones would strap into the moon costume for 25 more commercials. The popularity of the campaign

14:21.680 --> 14:27.120
would mark a turning point in his career. Today he is best known for his leading role of the

14:27.120 --> 14:33.200
amphibian man in academy award-winning film The Shape of Water. It seemed that no matter where or

14:33.200 --> 14:39.600
when Mac appeared, roaring success was sure to follow. By the end of the 80s, he was basking on

14:39.600 --> 14:45.600
cloud nine, lifting a fast food empire and its investors all the way to the moon. But in the

14:45.600 --> 14:52.400
midst of the company's greatest marketing campaign to date, not all was well in McDonaldland. By

14:52.400 --> 14:58.640
becoming the face of the franchise, Mac had strayed a bit too far from his roots. The character was

14:58.640 --> 15:04.480
originally conceived as a critique of wealth and capitalism, only to eventually wind up as the

15:04.480 --> 15:10.720
mascot for the most capitalistic company on the planet. The once iconoclastic Captain Mac had

15:10.720 --> 15:16.480
effectively sold out, and unfortunately for him, the pendulum was about to swing in the other

15:16.480 --> 15:21.840
direction. As fate would have it, the corporate gravy train that he now represented would soon

15:21.840 --> 15:25.760
betray him, as Mac Tonight was sacrificed for the system.

15:29.760 --> 15:36.400
In October 1989, Dodd-Darren filed a 10 million dollar lawsuit against McDonald's claiming that

15:36.400 --> 15:42.800
Mac Tonight had infringed on his father's song. At face value, it looked like a pretty nonsensical

15:42.800 --> 15:49.600
confrontation. Bobby Darin had passed away more than 15 years earlier, and his defining single

15:49.600 --> 15:55.360
wasn't exactly the most original composition. He didn't write the lyrics, he wasn't the first

15:55.360 --> 16:01.440
to perform the song, he hadn't single-handedly invented the crooner style. Like many works

16:01.440 --> 16:06.800
involving Mac, it was derivative content that just so happened to be in the right place at the right

16:06.800 --> 16:13.440
time. It's hard to say what Bobby Darin even owned that McDonald's could have possibly infringed upon,

16:13.440 --> 16:19.760
but due to the oppressive nature of our wonderful copyright system, not even Fortune 500 companies

16:19.760 --> 16:25.600
are exempt from getting pushed around by frivolous greed. Had McDonald's fought the lawsuit, they

16:25.600 --> 16:31.200
could have very easily won, but they decided that the legal expense was simply not worth the trouble

16:31.200 --> 16:36.880
to save an ad campaign that had pretty much run its course. With very little to gain in court,

16:36.960 --> 16:44.320
McDonald's chose to bite the bullet. And so, after nearly four years of service, Mac Tonight's golden

16:44.320 --> 16:50.080
run on the airwaves would come to an abrupt end. Who would have thought that after all this time,

16:50.080 --> 16:54.000
Mac finally got to experience what it was like to get stabbed in the back?

16:56.960 --> 17:02.080
While their fallen mascot was no longer allowed to perform his signature jingles,

17:02.080 --> 17:07.680
McDonald's wouldn't entirely give up on Mac Tonight. Starting in the 90s, they would install

17:07.680 --> 17:13.920
several Mac animatronics which played retro hits in stores across the country. During this time,

17:13.920 --> 17:21.280
Mac would still occasionally appear in commercials, including a brief campaign in 1997. That year would

17:21.280 --> 17:28.000
also see Mac make his debut in NASCAR, appearing as a select sponsor on Bill Elliott's number 94

17:28.000 --> 17:35.600
Ford. In 2007, 20 years after his national debut, a CG Mac would suddenly resurface on the

17:35.600 --> 17:42.320
international market, announcing the opening of 24-hour locations in Southeast Asia. But beyond

17:42.320 --> 17:48.480
these sparse sightings, Mac Tonight was essentially retired, left to ride off into the sunset as a

17:48.480 --> 17:55.200
marketing martyr and a hamburger hero. An ending that was a little too good to be true. By

17:55.200 --> 18:01.040
transforming Mac into the perfect company mascot, McDonald's had to omit the character's more

18:01.040 --> 18:07.920
distasteful attributes. It was a character who was never designed to be a hero, and one who had spent

18:07.920 --> 18:14.560
the past two decades running from the sins of his past. The truth is that Mac had built his legacy

18:14.560 --> 18:20.960
not through fame, but through notoriety. In a shocking turn of events, everyone would be rudely

18:20.960 --> 18:31.840
reminded about the dark side of the moon. In the mid-2000s, the internet revolution was in full

18:31.840 --> 18:38.960
swing. A popular site at the time was the online community YTM&D, a place where users could create

18:38.960 --> 18:44.800
their own web pages with looping images and audio. The site quickly became a prominent spawning

18:44.800 --> 18:51.440
ground for various memes and subcultures, and in the Wild West era of online moderation, practically

18:51.440 --> 18:58.000
nothing was off limits. Possibly the most infamous series of events to ever come out of YTM&D just

18:58.000 --> 19:04.720
so happened to involve a certain McDonald's mascot. Users had begun posting gifs of Mac Tonight as

19:04.720 --> 19:11.280
early as 2006, but the character's downward descent into degeneracy would truly begin in the spring of

19:11.360 --> 19:19.200
2007, all due to an individual by the name of Farkle. Starting in June, he created several sites

19:19.200 --> 19:25.840
combining Mac Tonight with AT&T Mike, a text-to-speech bot that could be made to say anything the user

19:25.840 --> 19:32.240
desired. As is the case with many things on the internet, what began as simply goofing around

19:32.240 --> 19:38.400
quickly devolved into something very profane and very offensive. Farkle's site soon inspired a

19:38.400 --> 19:43.920
variety of imitators looking to make their own twisted interpretations of the once family-friendly

19:43.920 --> 19:50.400
character. This heinous new alter ego of Mac Tonight came to be known by a different moniker,

19:50.400 --> 19:57.440
Moonman, a name that would live on in infamy. It started with a few racially insensitive chants

19:57.440 --> 20:02.720
and quickly escalated to full-blown song covers advocating for crimes against humanity.

20:03.360 --> 20:08.000
Some of these songs were so hideously obscene that they have since been expunged from all

20:08.000 --> 20:14.400
but the grittiest corners of the web. As the meme grew in notoriety, so too did the scope of its

20:14.400 --> 20:21.040
contributors. In 2008, several of the most prolific Moonman posters would form a faction known as the

20:21.040 --> 20:27.680
Moon Crew, a collection of users dedicated to the advancement of their new lunar overlord. Together,

20:27.680 --> 20:32.800
they would help establish a sophisticated lore around the character, which was unofficially

20:32.800 --> 20:38.320
referred to as the Mooniverse. In the following months, the Moon Crew would amass dozens of

20:38.320 --> 20:44.240
members who made themselves known as a nuisance to the entire platform. Moonman sites were being

20:44.240 --> 20:50.160
created with such abundance that they began to draw the attention of outside forces. During this

20:50.160 --> 20:55.440
time, many of the most popular Moonman edits would be frequently re-uploaded to YouTube,

20:55.440 --> 21:03.040
a platform with far stricter rules than YTM&D. Due to the extremely vulgar content of the genre,

21:03.040 --> 21:08.240
most of the YouTube uploads wouldn't last long before getting flagged and removed for community

21:08.240 --> 21:14.240
guidelines violations. But despite their short lifespans, the sheer amount of traffic on YouTube

21:14.240 --> 21:19.120
meant that it was the most visible place for the public to discover the shocking fate of the fast

21:19.120 --> 21:25.600
food legend. Evidently, McDonald's and AT&T must have received some complaints over the meme,

21:25.600 --> 21:31.600
with McDonald's issuing copyright strikes and AT&T banning the term Moonman from their text-to-speech

21:31.600 --> 21:38.960
service. Even YTM&D attempted to ban the Moon Crew from the platform, but with limitless accounts

21:38.960 --> 21:44.800
at their disposal, they could stick around for as long as they pleased. Despite their best efforts

21:44.800 --> 21:51.360
to quell the movement, the downfall of Mac Tonight could not be stopped. Moonman was not going

21:51.360 --> 21:57.680
anywhere, and for a new generation who had never seen Mac Tonight, it was the only version of him

21:57.680 --> 22:04.320
they ever knew. The racist megalomaniac would persist into the next decade, where he eventually

22:04.320 --> 22:11.440
reprised his former role as a mascot, this time representing 4chan's politically incorrect board.

22:11.440 --> 22:18.640
And in 2019, the meme was officially inducted into the Anti-Defamation League's list of hate symbols,

22:18.640 --> 22:24.480
an ugly ending to one of the most beloved characters of all time. Following the controversial

22:24.480 --> 22:30.720
turn, McDonald's would distance itself from their former marketing juggernaut. Nearly all of the

22:30.720 --> 22:36.640
Mac Tonight statues and animatronics have since been dismantled, and the character has remained

22:36.640 --> 22:43.360
absent from any official promotional material since 2010. Possibly the last remaining artifact

22:43.360 --> 22:48.160
of Mac's glorious reign can be found sitting high up in the rafters at the Entertainment

22:48.160 --> 22:54.080
McDonald's in Orlando, Florida. Oh Mac, where did we go so wrong?

22:58.720 --> 23:03.120
Mac Tonight's precipitous fall from grace may have been painful to watch,

23:03.120 --> 23:07.680
but oddly enough, it helped the character achieve something that very few others could.

23:08.400 --> 23:14.000
When you look back at the very beginning of Mac's journey, he was created to illustrate one essential

23:14.000 --> 23:20.400
conflict, the struggle of the masses versus the rich and powerful. The beggar's opera told the

23:20.400 --> 23:26.080
tale of an unrepentant thief, one who was no less virtuous than the system which outlawed him.

23:26.720 --> 23:31.440
It made a bold statement that the only difference between a thief and an aristocrat is the number

23:31.440 --> 23:37.600
of zeros in their bank account. Before anything can be stolen, we must choose to own it in the

23:37.600 --> 23:45.040
first place. Across most of human history, ideas were not stolen, only borrowed. We were all free

23:45.040 --> 23:51.760
to sing whatever song and recite whatever story we desired. Then came the age of mass consumption,

23:51.760 --> 23:57.040
where we decided to turn all of our favorite stories, songs, and characters into commodities.

23:57.600 --> 24:04.160
We now live in a grim era for creative discretion, where any remotely nuanced ideas ground up and

24:04.160 --> 24:10.240
mass-produced like a fast food assembly line. A character like Mac was borrowed and borrowed

24:10.240 --> 24:16.320
and borrowed until all of a sudden it was owned. As of now, nearly every fictional entity that

24:16.320 --> 24:22.400
pervades our culture has succumbed to the same fate, just another hopeless cog in the money-making

24:22.400 --> 24:29.520
machine. But by some extraordinary cosmic coincidence, Mac was different. It may have been

24:29.520 --> 24:36.880
through the ugliest means possible, but by God, we stole Mac back. He was returned to where he always

24:36.880 --> 24:43.760
belonged, in the loving hands of the masses. From Captain Mac to Mac the Knife to Mac the Knight and

24:43.760 --> 24:50.720
even Moon Man, he has always been destined to live in the public domain. The story of Mac is a

24:50.720 --> 24:56.800
remarkable case study in the evolution of media. It speaks to our ability to reimagine and

24:56.800 --> 25:03.200
recontextualize ideas into something entirely different. If there was one thing about Mac that

25:03.200 --> 25:08.640
stayed the same throughout his 300 year long transformation, it was that he absolutely stole

25:08.640 --> 25:15.600
the show no matter where he wound up, even in a medium as hated as advertising. The truth is,

25:15.600 --> 25:21.440
you look around at advertising today, it's all pretty boring. These days it's hard to say what

25:21.440 --> 25:28.320
marketing even is anymore. It mostly resembles a murky haze of corporations half-heartedly virtue

25:28.320 --> 25:34.160
signaling against the very issues they helped to create. Most people would agree that advertising

25:34.160 --> 25:39.840
today has never been more insufferable. The very same could probably be said about pretty much

25:39.840 --> 25:45.200
everything else in the world too. Now, more than ever, we could all benefit from a little bit of

25:45.200 --> 25:51.200
nostalgia. And for generations, perhaps no other character has been better at delivering a blast

25:51.200 --> 25:56.960
from the past than that surreal singing Moon. No one can predict exactly where and when Mac

25:56.960 --> 26:02.160
will show up next, but if one thing's for sure, we most likely haven't seen the last of him.

26:02.160 --> 26:15.840
So you've been gone for a while. Yeah, you could say that. Three months since the last upload.

26:15.840 --> 26:20.240
What exactly have you been up to? Well, to tell you the truth,

26:22.880 --> 26:28.400
I've been in a bit of a slump lately. Merchandise sales have been way down and management is

26:28.400 --> 26:33.440
starting to get a bit agitated, so I've been traveling around trying to get my mojo back.

26:34.160 --> 26:36.960
So they just let you disappear like that from once at a time?

26:37.600 --> 26:44.960
It may seem a little unorthodox, but trust me, it's all part of the process. Any numskull can

26:44.960 --> 26:50.480
chug a bunch of caffeine and pump out a list of ideas, but the truly great ideas require a bit

26:50.480 --> 26:57.120
more composure. You have to detach your mind from the burdens of everyday life, immerse yourself in

26:57.120 --> 27:02.720
a strange and unfamiliar territory, wander far enough, and you'll find what you're looking for.

27:05.520 --> 27:08.720
Seems like a pretty convoluted way to come up with a new shirt design.

27:08.720 --> 27:10.560
I hope you at least figured out something good.

27:13.200 --> 27:17.840
My journey brought me to some of the greatest creative minds that mankind has ever known.

27:18.400 --> 27:24.400
It was there where I studied the ultimate limits of proportion, form, and aesthetic beauty. Then,

27:24.480 --> 27:27.600
one moment after soaking it all in, I got it.

27:29.280 --> 27:36.240
And that's how I came up with my greatest t-shirt design yet. I call it Emp tonight.

27:37.120 --> 27:41.600
Wait, so your whole spiritual epiphany was to trace over a Mac Tonight poster?

27:41.600 --> 27:44.080
What kind of an amateur do you take me for?

27:44.080 --> 27:47.920
No, I hired an Indonesian guy on Fiverr and he traced it for me.

27:48.560 --> 27:51.920
You can't be serious. No one's gonna possibly want to buy this.

27:51.920 --> 27:58.080
I think you'll find that our focus testing was overwhelmingly positive. So, what do you think?

27:59.600 --> 28:03.040
Yeah, I mean, it looks great. Why is Mac Tonight green though?

28:03.760 --> 28:08.560
This whole thing is just nonsense. How are people supposed to know what Emp tonight even means?

28:09.120 --> 28:14.000
Way ahead of you, buddy. I'm gonna put together an entire video about the detailed history of

28:14.000 --> 28:19.920
Mac Tonight. And then, when the viewers are all nice and satisfied, it's time to exit

28:19.920 --> 28:24.880
through the gift shop and say hello to Emp tonight. I don't know. I'm not quite sure if

28:24.880 --> 28:31.200
this is the kind of thing your audience is looking for. Come on, this is a good product. I know it is.

28:31.200 --> 28:39.680
But the real question is, do you? The new Emp tonight merchandise collection,

28:39.680 --> 28:43.680
now available at crowdmade.com slash emp lemon.

28:50.880 --> 28:55.680
Come down to Mac tonight.

29:06.320 --> 29:09.680
Come down to Mac tonight.
