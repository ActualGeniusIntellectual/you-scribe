0	4400	Welcome everyone to another video where I talk about a certain meme youtuber.
4400	9600	Today, we're gonna talk about Graham the Christian, aka CowbellyTV,
9600	14080	aka the next big threat to memes, oh my gosh.
14080	15840	Well, what do I think of him?
15840	19440	I don't really think he's that bad of a channel.
20160	25360	So if you don't know about this guy, what he does is basically just post meme compilations.
25360	26000	That's all.
26000	27920	There's not really much else to it.
27920	33360	He just takes popular Twitter and Instagram posts and narrates them using a text-to-speech bot.
33360	37360	There's nothing really interesting or unique or nuanced about this channel,
37360	41600	other than the fact that it's been blowing up in popularity over the past few months.
41600	46000	If I could pick one word to describe this channel, it would be generic.
46000	47360	Nothing really stands out.
47360	48880	The editing is really simple.
48880	52400	There aren't any wildly brilliant or groundbreaking ideas here.
52400	53920	It's all been done before.
53920	58400	And I think that if this channel wasn't as popular as it has recently become,
58400	59840	then no one would really care.
59840	65200	But the fact that this channel has become so popular has made it a bit of a target as of late.
65200	70000	I've seen lots of people in my comments recently requesting that I expose this guy,
70000	73680	but I honestly don't have that much of a problem with his videos.
74320	89440	Yeah, I know I said I wouldn't talk about Behind the Meme again,
89440	93520	but I can hear you pinheads just slamming your faces into those keyboards
93520	95600	to spew out those angry little comments.
95600	96960	So hear me out here.
96960	99280	I'll reiterate this point yet again.
99280	103280	My issue with Behind the Meme was his false sense of purpose.
103280	107200	He marketed himself as this golden source of meme education
107200	111120	when he didn't have the knowledge or skills to back it up.
111120	116400	People bought into it at first, but later they grew to see him for what he really is, a fraud.
116400	119200	And now Behind the Meme's channel is kind of dead.
119200	120640	Did I kill him?
120640	124720	That's hard to say, but the bottom line is that he has lost his credibility
124720	126400	with the majority of his audience.
126400	129200	And that's something that you can't really get back.
129200	133360	In the case of CowbellyTV, this guy's content is also pretty mediocre,
133360	137040	but at least he doesn't try to portray himself as anything more than that.
137040	140640	He literally calls himself a meme stealer in his Twitter bio,
140640	142720	and I don't really see a problem with that.
142720	145440	Now, of course, I don't personally like the content
145440	148560	for the same reason that I don't like the Me IRL page on Twitter.
148560	150960	It's all just reposting other people's work.
150960	153120	And both of these channels play the same role.
153120	156240	They act as utilities, not personalities.
156240	160960	I can guarantee you that no one subscribed to this channel for its original content.
160960	163760	Channels like this provide a very specific purpose,
163760	167280	wrangling all the popular memes circulating Twitter and Instagram
167280	170480	and posting it all in one place for easy consumption.
170480	173120	Sure, there's nothing really admirable about it,
173120	175040	but I can't really complain about it either.
175040	178720	This channel is basically the equivalent of all those Vine compilation channels
178720	180080	that were blowing up last year.
180080	181760	But now that Vine's been shut down,
181760	185040	the only memes left to compile are Twitter and Instagram ones.
185040	188320	And I think the reason this channel has become so popular all of a sudden
188320	191200	is that the Vine audience ran out of new Vine memes
191200	193520	and trickled down to the next best alternative.
193520	194800	Man, I miss Vine.
194800	196320	Does anyone else miss Vine?
196320	199760	It was finally becoming good, and then they had to shut it down.
199760	201520	Anyway, back to Cowbelly.
201520	205600	I feel like the dude's just capitalizing on an obvious market here.
205600	206880	I gotta give him props.
206880	209440	Someone was gonna make bank on a channel like this,
209440	212080	and he just happened to be the one to think of the idea first.
212080	215200	His success has already sparked a boatload of imitators
215200	219040	combing Reddit and 4chan for material to post in compilations.
219040	220640	These videos are really quick to make,
220640	224640	and you can basically pump out three semi-engaging videos a week.
224640	227040	And when you do that for two years straight,
227040	231360	the YouTube algorithm is gonna reward you by spreading your videos far and wide.
231360	233120	That's just how this site works today.
233120	234960	Don't hate the player, hate the game.
234960	237680	Meanwhile, I'm just here spending three months on a video
237680	239760	just to have it instantly demonetized.
239760	240320	You know what?
240320	241040	Fuck this.
241040	241840	I quit.
241840	245200	Unless you guys give me free money and buy 10,000 t-shirts.
245200	248800	Maybe then I can make as much money as Cowbelly does for reposting memes.
248800	250400	Because that's all I care about.
250400	251120	Money.
251120	252480	Not good content.
252480	252960	Money.
252960	254160	So give me your money.
254160	256080	All right, that's about all I have to say.
256080	259600	But I can't help but feel that this video is missing something.
259600	262160	Oh right, complaining about normies.
262160	264160	Yeah, the dude's a total normie.
264160	266400	If you just look at his Instagram selfies,
266400	270000	then you'll notice that he's the physical embodiment of Chad.
270000	273040	He's got the Jacob Sartorius haircut and everything.
273040	275040	So yeah, fuck you Cowbelly.
275040	276880	AKA Graham the Christian.
276880	278960	AKA Chad the Meme Thief.
278960	284160	I do not like you because you have more subscribers than me and I am jealous.
284160	286400	So yeah, make sure to suck my balls,
286400	288080	smash that unsubscribe button,
288080	290640	and report this video so it gets demonetized
290640	293040	and forces me to get a job at McDonald's.
293040	294240	Fuck YouTube.
