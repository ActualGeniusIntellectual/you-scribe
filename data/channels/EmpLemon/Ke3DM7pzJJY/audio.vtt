00:00.000 --> 00:04.400
Welcome everyone to another video where I talk about a certain meme youtuber.

00:04.400 --> 00:09.600
Today, we're gonna talk about Graham the Christian, aka CowbellyTV,

00:09.600 --> 00:14.080
aka the next big threat to memes, oh my gosh.

00:14.080 --> 00:15.840
Well, what do I think of him?

00:15.840 --> 00:19.440
I don't really think he's that bad of a channel.

00:20.160 --> 00:25.360
So if you don't know about this guy, what he does is basically just post meme compilations.

00:25.360 --> 00:26.000
That's all.

00:26.000 --> 00:27.920
There's not really much else to it.

00:27.920 --> 00:33.360
He just takes popular Twitter and Instagram posts and narrates them using a text-to-speech bot.

00:33.360 --> 00:37.360
There's nothing really interesting or unique or nuanced about this channel,

00:37.360 --> 00:41.600
other than the fact that it's been blowing up in popularity over the past few months.

00:41.600 --> 00:46.000
If I could pick one word to describe this channel, it would be generic.

00:46.000 --> 00:47.360
Nothing really stands out.

00:47.360 --> 00:48.880
The editing is really simple.

00:48.880 --> 00:52.400
There aren't any wildly brilliant or groundbreaking ideas here.

00:52.400 --> 00:53.920
It's all been done before.

00:53.920 --> 00:58.400
And I think that if this channel wasn't as popular as it has recently become,

00:58.400 --> 00:59.840
then no one would really care.

00:59.840 --> 01:05.200
But the fact that this channel has become so popular has made it a bit of a target as of late.

01:05.200 --> 01:10.000
I've seen lots of people in my comments recently requesting that I expose this guy,

01:10.000 --> 01:13.680
but I honestly don't have that much of a problem with his videos.

01:14.320 --> 01:29.440
Yeah, I know I said I wouldn't talk about Behind the Meme again,

01:29.440 --> 01:33.520
but I can hear you pinheads just slamming your faces into those keyboards

01:33.520 --> 01:35.600
to spew out those angry little comments.

01:35.600 --> 01:36.960
So hear me out here.

01:36.960 --> 01:39.280
I'll reiterate this point yet again.

01:39.280 --> 01:43.280
My issue with Behind the Meme was his false sense of purpose.

01:43.280 --> 01:47.200
He marketed himself as this golden source of meme education

01:47.200 --> 01:51.120
when he didn't have the knowledge or skills to back it up.

01:51.120 --> 01:56.400
People bought into it at first, but later they grew to see him for what he really is, a fraud.

01:56.400 --> 01:59.200
And now Behind the Meme's channel is kind of dead.

01:59.200 --> 02:00.640
Did I kill him?

02:00.640 --> 02:04.720
That's hard to say, but the bottom line is that he has lost his credibility

02:04.720 --> 02:06.400
with the majority of his audience.

02:06.400 --> 02:09.200
And that's something that you can't really get back.

02:09.200 --> 02:13.360
In the case of CowbellyTV, this guy's content is also pretty mediocre,

02:13.360 --> 02:17.040
but at least he doesn't try to portray himself as anything more than that.

02:17.040 --> 02:20.640
He literally calls himself a meme stealer in his Twitter bio,

02:20.640 --> 02:22.720
and I don't really see a problem with that.

02:22.720 --> 02:25.440
Now, of course, I don't personally like the content

02:25.440 --> 02:28.560
for the same reason that I don't like the Me IRL page on Twitter.

02:28.560 --> 02:30.960
It's all just reposting other people's work.

02:30.960 --> 02:33.120
And both of these channels play the same role.

02:33.120 --> 02:36.240
They act as utilities, not personalities.

02:36.240 --> 02:40.960
I can guarantee you that no one subscribed to this channel for its original content.

02:40.960 --> 02:43.760
Channels like this provide a very specific purpose,

02:43.760 --> 02:47.280
wrangling all the popular memes circulating Twitter and Instagram

02:47.280 --> 02:50.480
and posting it all in one place for easy consumption.

02:50.480 --> 02:53.120
Sure, there's nothing really admirable about it,

02:53.120 --> 02:55.040
but I can't really complain about it either.

02:55.040 --> 02:58.720
This channel is basically the equivalent of all those Vine compilation channels

02:58.720 --> 03:00.080
that were blowing up last year.

03:00.080 --> 03:01.760
But now that Vine's been shut down,

03:01.760 --> 03:05.040
the only memes left to compile are Twitter and Instagram ones.

03:05.040 --> 03:08.320
And I think the reason this channel has become so popular all of a sudden

03:08.320 --> 03:11.200
is that the Vine audience ran out of new Vine memes

03:11.200 --> 03:13.520
and trickled down to the next best alternative.

03:13.520 --> 03:14.800
Man, I miss Vine.

03:14.800 --> 03:16.320
Does anyone else miss Vine?

03:16.320 --> 03:19.760
It was finally becoming good, and then they had to shut it down.

03:19.760 --> 03:21.520
Anyway, back to Cowbelly.

03:21.520 --> 03:25.600
I feel like the dude's just capitalizing on an obvious market here.

03:25.600 --> 03:26.880
I gotta give him props.

03:26.880 --> 03:29.440
Someone was gonna make bank on a channel like this,

03:29.440 --> 03:32.080
and he just happened to be the one to think of the idea first.

03:32.080 --> 03:35.200
His success has already sparked a boatload of imitators

03:35.200 --> 03:39.040
combing Reddit and 4chan for material to post in compilations.

03:39.040 --> 03:40.640
These videos are really quick to make,

03:40.640 --> 03:44.640
and you can basically pump out three semi-engaging videos a week.

03:44.640 --> 03:47.040
And when you do that for two years straight,

03:47.040 --> 03:51.360
the YouTube algorithm is gonna reward you by spreading your videos far and wide.

03:51.360 --> 03:53.120
That's just how this site works today.

03:53.120 --> 03:54.960
Don't hate the player, hate the game.

03:54.960 --> 03:57.680
Meanwhile, I'm just here spending three months on a video

03:57.680 --> 03:59.760
just to have it instantly demonetized.

03:59.760 --> 04:00.320
You know what?

04:00.320 --> 04:01.040
Fuck this.

04:01.040 --> 04:01.840
I quit.

04:01.840 --> 04:05.200
Unless you guys give me free money and buy 10,000 t-shirts.

04:05.200 --> 04:08.800
Maybe then I can make as much money as Cowbelly does for reposting memes.

04:08.800 --> 04:10.400
Because that's all I care about.

04:10.400 --> 04:11.120
Money.

04:11.120 --> 04:12.480
Not good content.

04:12.480 --> 04:12.960
Money.

04:12.960 --> 04:14.160
So give me your money.

04:14.160 --> 04:16.080
All right, that's about all I have to say.

04:16.080 --> 04:19.600
But I can't help but feel that this video is missing something.

04:19.600 --> 04:22.160
Oh right, complaining about normies.

04:22.160 --> 04:24.160
Yeah, the dude's a total normie.

04:24.160 --> 04:26.400
If you just look at his Instagram selfies,

04:26.400 --> 04:30.000
then you'll notice that he's the physical embodiment of Chad.

04:30.000 --> 04:33.040
He's got the Jacob Sartorius haircut and everything.

04:33.040 --> 04:35.040
So yeah, fuck you Cowbelly.

04:35.040 --> 04:36.880
AKA Graham the Christian.

04:36.880 --> 04:38.960
AKA Chad the Meme Thief.

04:38.960 --> 04:44.160
I do not like you because you have more subscribers than me and I am jealous.

04:44.160 --> 04:46.400
So yeah, make sure to suck my balls,

04:46.400 --> 04:48.080
smash that unsubscribe button,

04:48.080 --> 04:50.640
and report this video so it gets demonetized

04:50.640 --> 04:53.040
and forces me to get a job at McDonald's.

04:53.040 --> 04:54.240
Fuck YouTube.
