00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,400
Welcome everyone to another video where I talk about a certain meme youtuber.

2
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:09,600
Today, we're gonna talk about Graham the Christian, aka CowbellyTV,

3
00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:14,080
aka the next big threat to memes, oh my gosh.

4
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:15,840
Well, what do I think of him?

5
00:00:15,840 --> 00:00:19,440
I don't really think he's that bad of a channel.

6
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:25,360
So if you don't know about this guy, what he does is basically just post meme compilations.

7
00:00:25,360 --> 00:00:26,000
That's all.

8
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,920
There's not really much else to it.

9
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:33,360
He just takes popular Twitter and Instagram posts and narrates them using a text-to-speech bot.

10
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:37,360
There's nothing really interesting or unique or nuanced about this channel,

11
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:41,600
other than the fact that it's been blowing up in popularity over the past few months.

12
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:46,000
If I could pick one word to describe this channel, it would be generic.

13
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,360
Nothing really stands out.

14
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:48,880
The editing is really simple.

15
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:52,400
There aren't any wildly brilliant or groundbreaking ideas here.

16
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:53,920
It's all been done before.

17
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:58,400
And I think that if this channel wasn't as popular as it has recently become,

18
00:00:58,400 --> 00:00:59,840
then no one would really care.

19
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:05,200
But the fact that this channel has become so popular has made it a bit of a target as of late.

20
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:10,000
I've seen lots of people in my comments recently requesting that I expose this guy,

21
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,680
but I honestly don't have that much of a problem with his videos.

22
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:29,440
Yeah, I know I said I wouldn't talk about Behind the Meme again,

23
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:33,520
but I can hear you pinheads just slamming your faces into those keyboards

24
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:35,600
to spew out those angry little comments.

25
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:36,960
So hear me out here.

26
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:39,280
I'll reiterate this point yet again.

27
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:43,280
My issue with Behind the Meme was his false sense of purpose.

28
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:47,200
He marketed himself as this golden source of meme education

29
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:51,120
when he didn't have the knowledge or skills to back it up.

30
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:56,400
People bought into it at first, but later they grew to see him for what he really is, a fraud.

31
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:59,200
And now Behind the Meme's channel is kind of dead.

32
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:00,640
Did I kill him?

33
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:04,720
That's hard to say, but the bottom line is that he has lost his credibility

34
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:06,400
with the majority of his audience.

35
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:09,200
And that's something that you can't really get back.

36
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:13,360
In the case of CowbellyTV, this guy's content is also pretty mediocre,

37
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:17,040
but at least he doesn't try to portray himself as anything more than that.

38
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:20,640
He literally calls himself a meme stealer in his Twitter bio,

39
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:22,720
and I don't really see a problem with that.

40
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:25,440
Now, of course, I don't personally like the content

41
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:28,560
for the same reason that I don't like the Me IRL page on Twitter.

42
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:30,960
It's all just reposting other people's work.

43
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:33,120
And both of these channels play the same role.

44
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:36,240
They act as utilities, not personalities.

45
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:40,960
I can guarantee you that no one subscribed to this channel for its original content.

46
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:43,760
Channels like this provide a very specific purpose,

47
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:47,280
wrangling all the popular memes circulating Twitter and Instagram

48
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:50,480
and posting it all in one place for easy consumption.

49
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:53,120
Sure, there's nothing really admirable about it,

50
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:55,040
but I can't really complain about it either.

51
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:58,720
This channel is basically the equivalent of all those Vine compilation channels

52
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:00,080
that were blowing up last year.

53
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:01,760
But now that Vine's been shut down,

54
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:05,040
the only memes left to compile are Twitter and Instagram ones.

55
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:08,320
And I think the reason this channel has become so popular all of a sudden

56
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:11,200
is that the Vine audience ran out of new Vine memes

57
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:13,520
and trickled down to the next best alternative.

58
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:14,800
Man, I miss Vine.

59
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:16,320
Does anyone else miss Vine?

60
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:19,760
It was finally becoming good, and then they had to shut it down.

61
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:21,520
Anyway, back to Cowbelly.

62
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:25,600
I feel like the dude's just capitalizing on an obvious market here.

63
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:26,880
I gotta give him props.

64
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:29,440
Someone was gonna make bank on a channel like this,

65
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:32,080
and he just happened to be the one to think of the idea first.

66
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:35,200
His success has already sparked a boatload of imitators

67
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:39,040
combing Reddit and 4chan for material to post in compilations.

68
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:40,640
These videos are really quick to make,

69
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:44,640
and you can basically pump out three semi-engaging videos a week.

70
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:47,040
And when you do that for two years straight,

71
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:51,360
the YouTube algorithm is gonna reward you by spreading your videos far and wide.

72
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:53,120
That's just how this site works today.

73
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:54,960
Don't hate the player, hate the game.

74
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:57,680
Meanwhile, I'm just here spending three months on a video

75
00:03:57,680 --> 00:03:59,760
just to have it instantly demonetized.

76
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:00,320
You know what?

77
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:01,040
Fuck this.

78
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:01,840
I quit.

79
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:05,200
Unless you guys give me free money and buy 10,000 t-shirts.

80
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:08,800
Maybe then I can make as much money as Cowbelly does for reposting memes.

81
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:10,400
Because that's all I care about.

82
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:11,120
Money.

83
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:12,480
Not good content.

84
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:12,960
Money.

85
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:14,160
So give me your money.

86
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:16,080
All right, that's about all I have to say.

87
00:04:16,080 --> 00:04:19,600
But I can't help but feel that this video is missing something.

88
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:22,160
Oh right, complaining about normies.

89
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:24,160
Yeah, the dude's a total normie.

90
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:26,400
If you just look at his Instagram selfies,

91
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:30,000
then you'll notice that he's the physical embodiment of Chad.

92
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,040
He's got the Jacob Sartorius haircut and everything.

93
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:35,040
So yeah, fuck you Cowbelly.

94
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:36,880
AKA Graham the Christian.

95
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:38,960
AKA Chad the Meme Thief.

96
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:44,160
I do not like you because you have more subscribers than me and I am jealous.

97
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:46,400
So yeah, make sure to suck my balls,

98
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:48,080
smash that unsubscribe button,

99
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:50,640
and report this video so it gets demonetized

100
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:53,040
and forces me to get a job at McDonald's.

101
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:54,240
Fuck YouTube.
