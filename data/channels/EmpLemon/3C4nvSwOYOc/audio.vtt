00:00.000 --> 00:05.700
What if I told you there was a game out there with a community of over 800,000 players?

00:05.700 --> 00:12.340
What if I told you this game was available for both iOS and Android and is completely free-to-play?

00:12.340 --> 00:17.700
What if I told you that this isn't an ad for a dumb phone game with microtransactions?

00:17.700 --> 00:19.580
April Fools again, suckers!

00:19.580 --> 00:22.840
No company would dare run a product placement on this channel.

00:22.840 --> 00:28.400
However, if there are any delightfully devilish companies out there who'd be interested in sponsoring me,

00:29.400 --> 00:30.900
I'd be very surprised.

00:30.900 --> 00:34.500
But anyway, the game I'm talking about actually is a real game.

00:34.500 --> 00:37.000
It's a game that can run on almost any platform.

00:37.000 --> 00:39.900
PC, Mac, console, TV.

00:39.900 --> 00:43.900
All you really need to play this game is an internet connection and a YouTube account.

00:43.900 --> 00:48.700
This is a game that has been played continuously for over seven years straight now.

00:48.700 --> 00:51.700
This is a game that wasn't even designed to be a game.

00:51.700 --> 00:55.300
And even though hundreds of thousands of players continue to enjoy it,

00:55.300 --> 00:58.300
this is a game that might not be around for much longer.

00:58.300 --> 01:02.100
This is the story of Neutral Response.

01:14.800 --> 01:18.100
YouTube has always been a place where you can find clips of TV shows.

01:18.100 --> 01:21.400
It's hard to imagine YouTube without a bunch of random bozos

01:21.400 --> 01:27.300
uploading entire scenes and compilations from Family Guy or The Simpsons and then getting millions of views.

01:27.400 --> 01:30.500
This type of content has always been a sore issue for YouTube.

01:30.500 --> 01:37.100
And much of the copyright system on the website today has been constructed specifically to prevent people from uploading clips of TV shows.

01:49.100 --> 01:54.300
Because of this, it's no surprise that most of these clips don't stick around for long on YouTube.

01:54.300 --> 01:59.100
But miraculously, some of these clips managed to beat the odds and slip through the cracks.

01:59.100 --> 02:04.700
One of these videos that has stood the test of time is this five-second joke from an episode of Futurama.

02:08.700 --> 02:13.300
This video was uploaded in April 2009 by a user called Leetag.

02:13.300 --> 02:15.100
Now, who is Leetag?

02:15.100 --> 02:17.400
Nobody knows, and nobody really cares either.

02:17.400 --> 02:21.800
Judging by his favorites, he's into video games, Star Wars, and Dragon Ball.

02:21.800 --> 02:24.500
A pretty typical internet user, if you ask me.

02:24.500 --> 02:29.200
He's a guy who you'd glance at in any YouTube comment section and not give a single thought.

02:29.200 --> 02:30.700
So why does this matter?

02:30.700 --> 02:37.800
Well, I believe it's a pure testament to how some of the greatest things on YouTube can come from the most unexpected places.

02:37.800 --> 02:43.100
I just find it a huge cosmic coincidence that this one ordinary YouTuber

02:43.100 --> 02:49.700
who contributed only six videos of random clips from TV shows during his entire existence on the website,

02:49.700 --> 02:57.700
this totally unsuspecting individual just happened to accidentally create one of the most interesting attractions on all of YouTube.

02:57.700 --> 03:02.700
So if you're not familiar with the Neutral Response video, you're probably wondering what makes it so special.

03:02.700 --> 03:04.700
It certainly didn't start out that way.

03:04.700 --> 03:08.300
For almost a year, Neutral Response was just an average YouTube video,

03:08.300 --> 03:14.300
perhaps seeing some use as the occasional forum weapon, but otherwise a completely forgettable video.

03:14.300 --> 03:18.600
The story of Neutral Response really began on April 1st, 2010,

03:18.600 --> 03:23.400
a day when YouTube launched one of the most drastic layout changes in the history of the site.

03:23.400 --> 03:30.200
I always remembered this specific day because at the time, I hated the new layout and I thought it was just a bad April Fool's joke.

03:30.200 --> 03:33.500
But unfortunately for me, this new layout was here to stay.

03:33.500 --> 03:38.300
It changed up a bunch of stuff, but all you need to know for today's video is that this was the update

03:38.300 --> 03:43.300
where YouTube replaced the classic star rating system with the modern like system.

03:43.300 --> 03:47.700
Now, in retrospect, I actually prefer the current system over the star system.

03:47.800 --> 03:53.300
I only used to rate videos five or one stars anyway, and I'm pretty sure most people did the same thing.

03:53.300 --> 03:57.300
Replacing the stars with likes and dislikes made everything a lot more streamlined.

03:57.300 --> 04:01.700
Although I wish they would display video ratings under the thumbnails like they used to.

04:01.700 --> 04:04.600
That was the one thing they did better under the star system.

04:04.600 --> 04:08.100
I mean, come on, YouTube. Porn websites figured this out years ago.

04:08.100 --> 04:09.700
Don't you want to stop clickbait?

04:09.700 --> 04:13.700
Ah, who am I kidding? YouTube would go out of business if they didn't have clickbait.

04:13.700 --> 04:18.200
But anyway, YouTube's new rating system went through a few different designs until 2011

04:18.200 --> 04:25.500
when it settled on the now iconic diametrically opposed ratings bar, also known as the green lightsaber.

04:25.500 --> 04:28.500
And at about the same time YouTube implemented this change,

04:28.500 --> 04:33.100
something very interesting began to happen in the ratings of neutral response.

04:33.100 --> 04:40.300
It started off like any other video, 300 likes, 6 dislikes, a good ratio no doubt, maybe even a great one.

04:40.300 --> 04:44.200
But then, a few months later, the dislikes had grown by just a bit.

04:44.200 --> 04:45.900
What is this sudden incursion?

04:45.900 --> 04:50.200
Well, it started with just a few comments promoting a simple objective.

04:50.200 --> 04:54.400
Balance the likes and dislikes so that the video is truly neutral.

04:54.400 --> 04:57.900
But this was just a handful of people suggesting a silly joke.

04:57.900 --> 05:00.900
And there was no way that this idea could possibly catch on.

05:04.900 --> 05:07.900
I have no strong feelings one way or the other.

05:10.300 --> 05:13.700
...back out to Allen, his rebuttal, bang!

05:13.700 --> 05:16.900
Tie game with five seconds remaining!

05:16.900 --> 05:19.600
Always with you and cannot be done.

05:19.600 --> 05:22.000
No, try not.

05:22.000 --> 05:24.500
Do or do not.

05:24.500 --> 05:27.500
There is no try.

05:27.500 --> 05:31.200
So a bunch of random strangers who had virtually no means of communication

05:31.200 --> 05:37.100
were given the mere suggestion of a task and they accomplished it in less than three months.

05:37.100 --> 05:43.700
But if that wasn't impressive enough, the YouTube community maintained the ratings balance for more than half a decade.

05:43.700 --> 05:49.000
They maintained the balance even as the video views passed 1 million, 2 million, 4 million.

05:49.000 --> 05:56.100
As the likes rose to the hundreds of thousands, there were almost always an equal number of dislikes to match.

05:56.100 --> 06:02.400
The balance persisted from the green lightsaber, to the gray lightsaber, to the blue lightsaber.

06:02.400 --> 06:08.600
And perhaps YouTube changing the ratings bar to more neutral colors made this video even more legendary.

06:08.600 --> 06:12.500
It became one of the most spectacular attractions on all of YouTube.

06:12.500 --> 06:16.600
And while others have tried to emulate it, it's pretty tough to beat the original.

06:16.600 --> 06:20.200
You see, neutral response isn't just a YouTube video.

06:20.200 --> 06:21.200
It's a game.

06:21.200 --> 06:27.800
It's a carefully constructed meta joke that has been preserved by generations of YouTubers.

06:27.800 --> 06:33.800
Just imagine all the circumstances, all the stars that had to align to create this one simple joke.

06:33.800 --> 06:39.100
A joke told not by a single creator, but by hundreds of thousands of collaborators.

06:39.100 --> 06:42.600
Some of whom had no intention of contributing anything.

06:42.600 --> 06:49.200
Helping to accidentally create one of the most stunningly unique social experiments on the entire internet.

06:49.200 --> 06:55.000
And with that being said, it's kind of a shame that this video might not be so special for much longer.

06:55.000 --> 06:59.100
In August 2017, YouTube rolled out yet another layout change.

06:59.100 --> 07:05.200
They made it optional at first, but YouTube did what they always do with these changes and made it mandatory after several months.

07:05.200 --> 07:09.900
One of the changes on the new layout was rounding off video ratings to only three digits.

07:09.900 --> 07:17.600
On the desktop version, it's still possible to hover your cursor over the now minuscule ratings bar to see the exact number, but nobody knows that.

07:17.600 --> 07:23.800
And because of this new update, it's never been more difficult to maintain the balance on neutral response.

07:23.800 --> 07:27.900
It's yet another reason why I cannot stand minimalism.

07:27.900 --> 07:31.000
But hey, at least they added dark mode.

07:31.000 --> 07:33.000
That's pretty neat, I guess.

07:38.000 --> 07:44.400
Perhaps it's somewhat fitting that a layout change would threaten to end the brilliance of neutral response,

07:44.400 --> 07:48.700
since it was a layout change that started the movement in the first place.

07:48.700 --> 07:50.700
But then again, why does it matter?

07:50.700 --> 07:54.800
At the end of the day, the ratings bar on neutral response is just a gimmick.

07:54.800 --> 08:00.000
A clever little gag that went a little bit farther than what most people originally envisioned.

08:00.000 --> 08:02.600
Because all it is is a dumb joke, right?

08:02.600 --> 08:06.300
Well, I don't exactly see it that way.

08:06.300 --> 08:12.800
When most people think of YouTube, they think of a place where selfish and vapid people come together to argue and waste time.

08:12.800 --> 08:18.600
Most YouTubers these days are haughty, egomaniacs that never shut up about themselves.

08:18.600 --> 08:22.900
Everyone's stuck in a rat race to snag their 15 minutes of fame,

08:22.900 --> 08:29.400
and it seems like you can't mention anything on this site without sparking a gladiatorial battle in the comment section.

08:29.400 --> 08:35.100
At times, it seems impossible to get people on YouTube to agree on anything.

08:35.100 --> 08:38.800
But this video flies in the face of all of that.

08:38.800 --> 08:44.600
This video represents one of the most ambitious cooperative efforts in the history of the site.

08:44.600 --> 08:48.000
There's just something so beautifully serene about it.

08:48.000 --> 08:53.500
A tiny nugget of balance and harmony in a sea of chaos and dysfunction.

08:53.500 --> 08:58.700
It speaks something truly profound about the nature of man and the human spirit.

08:58.700 --> 09:05.700
And to think people just did it as complete anonymous strangers without any direct instruction or communication.

09:05.700 --> 09:09.400
It really makes you wonder how something like this could even exist.

09:09.400 --> 09:13.800
But it's real. It's as real as any other video on this website.

09:13.800 --> 09:16.400
You could go visit this video right now.

09:16.400 --> 09:22.800
And if you do, you can pay your respects to one of the greatest natural wonders on all of YouTube.

09:22.800 --> 09:30.300
And if you find yourself in this situation, make sure to do your civic duty and restore the balance.

09:43.800 --> 09:57.300
Thanks for watching!
