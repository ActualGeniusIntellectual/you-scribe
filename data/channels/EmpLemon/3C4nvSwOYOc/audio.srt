1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,700
What if I told you there was a game out there with a community of over 800,000 players?

2
00:00:05,700 --> 00:00:12,340
What if I told you this game was available for both iOS and Android and is completely free-to-play?

3
00:00:12,340 --> 00:00:17,700
What if I told you that this isn't an ad for a dumb phone game with microtransactions?

4
00:00:17,700 --> 00:00:19,580
April Fools again, suckers!

5
00:00:19,580 --> 00:00:22,840
No company would dare run a product placement on this channel.

6
00:00:22,840 --> 00:00:28,400
However, if there are any delightfully devilish companies out there who'd be interested in sponsoring me,

7
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:30,900
I'd be very surprised.

8
00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:34,500
But anyway, the game I'm talking about actually is a real game.

9
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:37,000
It's a game that can run on almost any platform.

10
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,900
PC, Mac, console, TV.

11
00:00:39,900 --> 00:00:43,900
All you really need to play this game is an internet connection and a YouTube account.

12
00:00:43,900 --> 00:00:48,700
This is a game that has been played continuously for over seven years straight now.

13
00:00:48,700 --> 00:00:51,700
This is a game that wasn't even designed to be a game.

14
00:00:51,700 --> 00:00:55,300
And even though hundreds of thousands of players continue to enjoy it,

15
00:00:55,300 --> 00:00:58,300
this is a game that might not be around for much longer.

16
00:00:58,300 --> 00:01:02,100
This is the story of Neutral Response.

17
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:18,100
YouTube has always been a place where you can find clips of TV shows.

18
00:01:18,100 --> 00:01:21,400
It's hard to imagine YouTube without a bunch of random bozos

19
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:27,300
uploading entire scenes and compilations from Family Guy or The Simpsons and then getting millions of views.

20
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:30,500
This type of content has always been a sore issue for YouTube.

21
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:37,100
And much of the copyright system on the website today has been constructed specifically to prevent people from uploading clips of TV shows.

22
00:01:49,100 --> 00:01:54,300
Because of this, it's no surprise that most of these clips don't stick around for long on YouTube.

23
00:01:54,300 --> 00:01:59,100
But miraculously, some of these clips managed to beat the odds and slip through the cracks.

24
00:01:59,100 --> 00:02:04,700
One of these videos that has stood the test of time is this five-second joke from an episode of Futurama.

25
00:02:08,700 --> 00:02:13,300
This video was uploaded in April 2009 by a user called Leetag.

26
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:15,100
Now, who is Leetag?

27
00:02:15,100 --> 00:02:17,400
Nobody knows, and nobody really cares either.

28
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:21,800
Judging by his favorites, he's into video games, Star Wars, and Dragon Ball.

29
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:24,500
A pretty typical internet user, if you ask me.

30
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:29,200
He's a guy who you'd glance at in any YouTube comment section and not give a single thought.

31
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:30,700
So why does this matter?

32
00:02:30,700 --> 00:02:37,800
Well, I believe it's a pure testament to how some of the greatest things on YouTube can come from the most unexpected places.

33
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:43,100
I just find it a huge cosmic coincidence that this one ordinary YouTuber

34
00:02:43,100 --> 00:02:49,700
who contributed only six videos of random clips from TV shows during his entire existence on the website,

35
00:02:49,700 --> 00:02:57,700
this totally unsuspecting individual just happened to accidentally create one of the most interesting attractions on all of YouTube.

36
00:02:57,700 --> 00:03:02,700
So if you're not familiar with the Neutral Response video, you're probably wondering what makes it so special.

37
00:03:02,700 --> 00:03:04,700
It certainly didn't start out that way.

38
00:03:04,700 --> 00:03:08,300
For almost a year, Neutral Response was just an average YouTube video,

39
00:03:08,300 --> 00:03:14,300
perhaps seeing some use as the occasional forum weapon, but otherwise a completely forgettable video.

40
00:03:14,300 --> 00:03:18,600
The story of Neutral Response really began on April 1st, 2010,

41
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:23,400
a day when YouTube launched one of the most drastic layout changes in the history of the site.

42
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:30,200
I always remembered this specific day because at the time, I hated the new layout and I thought it was just a bad April Fool's joke.

43
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:33,500
But unfortunately for me, this new layout was here to stay.

44
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:38,300
It changed up a bunch of stuff, but all you need to know for today's video is that this was the update

45
00:03:38,300 --> 00:03:43,300
where YouTube replaced the classic star rating system with the modern like system.

46
00:03:43,300 --> 00:03:47,700
Now, in retrospect, I actually prefer the current system over the star system.

47
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:53,300
I only used to rate videos five or one stars anyway, and I'm pretty sure most people did the same thing.

48
00:03:53,300 --> 00:03:57,300
Replacing the stars with likes and dislikes made everything a lot more streamlined.

49
00:03:57,300 --> 00:04:01,700
Although I wish they would display video ratings under the thumbnails like they used to.

50
00:04:01,700 --> 00:04:04,600
That was the one thing they did better under the star system.

51
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:08,100
I mean, come on, YouTube. Porn websites figured this out years ago.

52
00:04:08,100 --> 00:04:09,700
Don't you want to stop clickbait?

53
00:04:09,700 --> 00:04:13,700
Ah, who am I kidding? YouTube would go out of business if they didn't have clickbait.

54
00:04:13,700 --> 00:04:18,200
But anyway, YouTube's new rating system went through a few different designs until 2011

55
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:25,500
when it settled on the now iconic diametrically opposed ratings bar, also known as the green lightsaber.

56
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:28,500
And at about the same time YouTube implemented this change,

57
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:33,100
something very interesting began to happen in the ratings of neutral response.

58
00:04:33,100 --> 00:04:40,300
It started off like any other video, 300 likes, 6 dislikes, a good ratio no doubt, maybe even a great one.

59
00:04:40,300 --> 00:04:44,200
But then, a few months later, the dislikes had grown by just a bit.

60
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:45,900
What is this sudden incursion?

61
00:04:45,900 --> 00:04:50,200
Well, it started with just a few comments promoting a simple objective.

62
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:54,400
Balance the likes and dislikes so that the video is truly neutral.

63
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:57,900
But this was just a handful of people suggesting a silly joke.

64
00:04:57,900 --> 00:05:00,900
And there was no way that this idea could possibly catch on.

65
00:05:04,900 --> 00:05:07,900
I have no strong feelings one way or the other.

66
00:05:10,300 --> 00:05:13,700
...back out to Allen, his rebuttal, bang!

67
00:05:13,700 --> 00:05:16,900
Tie game with five seconds remaining!

68
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:19,600
Always with you and cannot be done.

69
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:22,000
No, try not.

70
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,500
Do or do not.

71
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:27,500
There is no try.

72
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:31,200
So a bunch of random strangers who had virtually no means of communication

73
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:37,100
were given the mere suggestion of a task and they accomplished it in less than three months.

74
00:05:37,100 --> 00:05:43,700
But if that wasn't impressive enough, the YouTube community maintained the ratings balance for more than half a decade.

75
00:05:43,700 --> 00:05:49,000
They maintained the balance even as the video views passed 1 million, 2 million, 4 million.

76
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:56,100
As the likes rose to the hundreds of thousands, there were almost always an equal number of dislikes to match.

77
00:05:56,100 --> 00:06:02,400
The balance persisted from the green lightsaber, to the gray lightsaber, to the blue lightsaber.

78
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:08,600
And perhaps YouTube changing the ratings bar to more neutral colors made this video even more legendary.

79
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:12,500
It became one of the most spectacular attractions on all of YouTube.

80
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:16,600
And while others have tried to emulate it, it's pretty tough to beat the original.

81
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:20,200
You see, neutral response isn't just a YouTube video.

82
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:21,200
It's a game.

83
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:27,800
It's a carefully constructed meta joke that has been preserved by generations of YouTubers.

84
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:33,800
Just imagine all the circumstances, all the stars that had to align to create this one simple joke.

85
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:39,100
A joke told not by a single creator, but by hundreds of thousands of collaborators.

86
00:06:39,100 --> 00:06:42,600
Some of whom had no intention of contributing anything.

87
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:49,200
Helping to accidentally create one of the most stunningly unique social experiments on the entire internet.

88
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:55,000
And with that being said, it's kind of a shame that this video might not be so special for much longer.

89
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:59,100
In August 2017, YouTube rolled out yet another layout change.

90
00:06:59,100 --> 00:07:05,200
They made it optional at first, but YouTube did what they always do with these changes and made it mandatory after several months.

91
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:09,900
One of the changes on the new layout was rounding off video ratings to only three digits.

92
00:07:09,900 --> 00:07:17,600
On the desktop version, it's still possible to hover your cursor over the now minuscule ratings bar to see the exact number, but nobody knows that.

93
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:23,800
And because of this new update, it's never been more difficult to maintain the balance on neutral response.

94
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:27,900
It's yet another reason why I cannot stand minimalism.

95
00:07:27,900 --> 00:07:31,000
But hey, at least they added dark mode.

96
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
That's pretty neat, I guess.

97
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:44,400
Perhaps it's somewhat fitting that a layout change would threaten to end the brilliance of neutral response,

98
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:48,700
since it was a layout change that started the movement in the first place.

99
00:07:48,700 --> 00:07:50,700
But then again, why does it matter?

100
00:07:50,700 --> 00:07:54,800
At the end of the day, the ratings bar on neutral response is just a gimmick.

101
00:07:54,800 --> 00:08:00,000
A clever little gag that went a little bit farther than what most people originally envisioned.

102
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,600
Because all it is is a dumb joke, right?

103
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:06,300
Well, I don't exactly see it that way.

104
00:08:06,300 --> 00:08:12,800
When most people think of YouTube, they think of a place where selfish and vapid people come together to argue and waste time.

105
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:18,600
Most YouTubers these days are haughty, egomaniacs that never shut up about themselves.

106
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:22,900
Everyone's stuck in a rat race to snag their 15 minutes of fame,

107
00:08:22,900 --> 00:08:29,400
and it seems like you can't mention anything on this site without sparking a gladiatorial battle in the comment section.

108
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:35,100
At times, it seems impossible to get people on YouTube to agree on anything.

109
00:08:35,100 --> 00:08:38,800
But this video flies in the face of all of that.

110
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:44,600
This video represents one of the most ambitious cooperative efforts in the history of the site.

111
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:48,000
There's just something so beautifully serene about it.

112
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:53,500
A tiny nugget of balance and harmony in a sea of chaos and dysfunction.

113
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:58,700
It speaks something truly profound about the nature of man and the human spirit.

114
00:08:58,700 --> 00:09:05,700
And to think people just did it as complete anonymous strangers without any direct instruction or communication.

115
00:09:05,700 --> 00:09:09,400
It really makes you wonder how something like this could even exist.

116
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:13,800
But it's real. It's as real as any other video on this website.

117
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:16,400
You could go visit this video right now.

118
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:22,800
And if you do, you can pay your respects to one of the greatest natural wonders on all of YouTube.

119
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:30,300
And if you find yourself in this situation, make sure to do your civic duty and restore the balance.

120
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:57,300
Thanks for watching!
