0	5700	What if I told you there was a game out there with a community of over 800,000 players?
5700	12340	What if I told you this game was available for both iOS and Android and is completely free-to-play?
12340	17700	What if I told you that this isn't an ad for a dumb phone game with microtransactions?
17700	19580	April Fools again, suckers!
19580	22840	No company would dare run a product placement on this channel.
22840	28400	However, if there are any delightfully devilish companies out there who'd be interested in sponsoring me,
29400	30900	I'd be very surprised.
30900	34500	But anyway, the game I'm talking about actually is a real game.
34500	37000	It's a game that can run on almost any platform.
37000	39900	PC, Mac, console, TV.
39900	43900	All you really need to play this game is an internet connection and a YouTube account.
43900	48700	This is a game that has been played continuously for over seven years straight now.
48700	51700	This is a game that wasn't even designed to be a game.
51700	55300	And even though hundreds of thousands of players continue to enjoy it,
55300	58300	this is a game that might not be around for much longer.
58300	62100	This is the story of Neutral Response.
74800	78100	YouTube has always been a place where you can find clips of TV shows.
78100	81400	It's hard to imagine YouTube without a bunch of random bozos
81400	87300	uploading entire scenes and compilations from Family Guy or The Simpsons and then getting millions of views.
87400	90500	This type of content has always been a sore issue for YouTube.
90500	97100	And much of the copyright system on the website today has been constructed specifically to prevent people from uploading clips of TV shows.
109100	114300	Because of this, it's no surprise that most of these clips don't stick around for long on YouTube.
114300	119100	But miraculously, some of these clips managed to beat the odds and slip through the cracks.
119100	124700	One of these videos that has stood the test of time is this five-second joke from an episode of Futurama.
128700	133300	This video was uploaded in April 2009 by a user called Leetag.
133300	135100	Now, who is Leetag?
135100	137400	Nobody knows, and nobody really cares either.
137400	141800	Judging by his favorites, he's into video games, Star Wars, and Dragon Ball.
141800	144500	A pretty typical internet user, if you ask me.
144500	149200	He's a guy who you'd glance at in any YouTube comment section and not give a single thought.
149200	150700	So why does this matter?
150700	157800	Well, I believe it's a pure testament to how some of the greatest things on YouTube can come from the most unexpected places.
157800	163100	I just find it a huge cosmic coincidence that this one ordinary YouTuber
163100	169700	who contributed only six videos of random clips from TV shows during his entire existence on the website,
169700	177700	this totally unsuspecting individual just happened to accidentally create one of the most interesting attractions on all of YouTube.
177700	182700	So if you're not familiar with the Neutral Response video, you're probably wondering what makes it so special.
182700	184700	It certainly didn't start out that way.
184700	188300	For almost a year, Neutral Response was just an average YouTube video,
188300	194300	perhaps seeing some use as the occasional forum weapon, but otherwise a completely forgettable video.
194300	198600	The story of Neutral Response really began on April 1st, 2010,
198600	203400	a day when YouTube launched one of the most drastic layout changes in the history of the site.
203400	210200	I always remembered this specific day because at the time, I hated the new layout and I thought it was just a bad April Fool's joke.
210200	213500	But unfortunately for me, this new layout was here to stay.
213500	218300	It changed up a bunch of stuff, but all you need to know for today's video is that this was the update
218300	223300	where YouTube replaced the classic star rating system with the modern like system.
223300	227700	Now, in retrospect, I actually prefer the current system over the star system.
227800	233300	I only used to rate videos five or one stars anyway, and I'm pretty sure most people did the same thing.
233300	237300	Replacing the stars with likes and dislikes made everything a lot more streamlined.
237300	241700	Although I wish they would display video ratings under the thumbnails like they used to.
241700	244600	That was the one thing they did better under the star system.
244600	248100	I mean, come on, YouTube. Porn websites figured this out years ago.
248100	249700	Don't you want to stop clickbait?
249700	253700	Ah, who am I kidding? YouTube would go out of business if they didn't have clickbait.
253700	258200	But anyway, YouTube's new rating system went through a few different designs until 2011
258200	265500	when it settled on the now iconic diametrically opposed ratings bar, also known as the green lightsaber.
265500	268500	And at about the same time YouTube implemented this change,
268500	273100	something very interesting began to happen in the ratings of neutral response.
273100	280300	It started off like any other video, 300 likes, 6 dislikes, a good ratio no doubt, maybe even a great one.
280300	284200	But then, a few months later, the dislikes had grown by just a bit.
284200	285900	What is this sudden incursion?
285900	290200	Well, it started with just a few comments promoting a simple objective.
290200	294400	Balance the likes and dislikes so that the video is truly neutral.
294400	297900	But this was just a handful of people suggesting a silly joke.
297900	300900	And there was no way that this idea could possibly catch on.
304900	307900	I have no strong feelings one way or the other.
310300	313700	...back out to Allen, his rebuttal, bang!
313700	316900	Tie game with five seconds remaining!
316900	319600	Always with you and cannot be done.
319600	322000	No, try not.
322000	324500	Do or do not.
324500	327500	There is no try.
327500	331200	So a bunch of random strangers who had virtually no means of communication
331200	337100	were given the mere suggestion of a task and they accomplished it in less than three months.
337100	343700	But if that wasn't impressive enough, the YouTube community maintained the ratings balance for more than half a decade.
343700	349000	They maintained the balance even as the video views passed 1 million, 2 million, 4 million.
349000	356100	As the likes rose to the hundreds of thousands, there were almost always an equal number of dislikes to match.
356100	362400	The balance persisted from the green lightsaber, to the gray lightsaber, to the blue lightsaber.
362400	368600	And perhaps YouTube changing the ratings bar to more neutral colors made this video even more legendary.
368600	372500	It became one of the most spectacular attractions on all of YouTube.
372500	376600	And while others have tried to emulate it, it's pretty tough to beat the original.
376600	380200	You see, neutral response isn't just a YouTube video.
380200	381200	It's a game.
381200	387800	It's a carefully constructed meta joke that has been preserved by generations of YouTubers.
387800	393800	Just imagine all the circumstances, all the stars that had to align to create this one simple joke.
393800	399100	A joke told not by a single creator, but by hundreds of thousands of collaborators.
399100	402600	Some of whom had no intention of contributing anything.
402600	409200	Helping to accidentally create one of the most stunningly unique social experiments on the entire internet.
409200	415000	And with that being said, it's kind of a shame that this video might not be so special for much longer.
415000	419100	In August 2017, YouTube rolled out yet another layout change.
419100	425200	They made it optional at first, but YouTube did what they always do with these changes and made it mandatory after several months.
425200	429900	One of the changes on the new layout was rounding off video ratings to only three digits.
429900	437600	On the desktop version, it's still possible to hover your cursor over the now minuscule ratings bar to see the exact number, but nobody knows that.
437600	443800	And because of this new update, it's never been more difficult to maintain the balance on neutral response.
443800	447900	It's yet another reason why I cannot stand minimalism.
447900	451000	But hey, at least they added dark mode.
451000	453000	That's pretty neat, I guess.
458000	464400	Perhaps it's somewhat fitting that a layout change would threaten to end the brilliance of neutral response,
464400	468700	since it was a layout change that started the movement in the first place.
468700	470700	But then again, why does it matter?
470700	474800	At the end of the day, the ratings bar on neutral response is just a gimmick.
474800	480000	A clever little gag that went a little bit farther than what most people originally envisioned.
480000	482600	Because all it is is a dumb joke, right?
482600	486300	Well, I don't exactly see it that way.
486300	492800	When most people think of YouTube, they think of a place where selfish and vapid people come together to argue and waste time.
492800	498600	Most YouTubers these days are haughty, egomaniacs that never shut up about themselves.
498600	502900	Everyone's stuck in a rat race to snag their 15 minutes of fame,
502900	509400	and it seems like you can't mention anything on this site without sparking a gladiatorial battle in the comment section.
509400	515100	At times, it seems impossible to get people on YouTube to agree on anything.
515100	518800	But this video flies in the face of all of that.
518800	524600	This video represents one of the most ambitious cooperative efforts in the history of the site.
524600	528000	There's just something so beautifully serene about it.
528000	533500	A tiny nugget of balance and harmony in a sea of chaos and dysfunction.
533500	538700	It speaks something truly profound about the nature of man and the human spirit.
538700	545700	And to think people just did it as complete anonymous strangers without any direct instruction or communication.
545700	549400	It really makes you wonder how something like this could even exist.
549400	553800	But it's real. It's as real as any other video on this website.
553800	556400	You could go visit this video right now.
556400	562800	And if you do, you can pay your respects to one of the greatest natural wonders on all of YouTube.
562800	570300	And if you find yourself in this situation, make sure to do your civic duty and restore the balance.
583800	597300	Thanks for watching!
