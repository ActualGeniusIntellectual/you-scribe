00:00.000 --> 00:02.300
It's April 21st, 2019.

00:02.300 --> 00:07.600
Competitors and spectators have gathered in Laurel, Maryland for the Pound 2019 tournament.

00:07.600 --> 00:13.300
Today we visit the meeting of two players competing under the aliases of Mango and Hungrybox.

00:13.300 --> 00:20.100
They're playing Super Smash Brothers Melee, a video game released in 2001 for the Nintendo GameCube.

00:20.100 --> 00:25.200
Despite the age of the game, this event has managed to attract a live audience of a few hundred spectators

00:25.200 --> 00:29.100
and upwards of 70,000 viewers tuning in from around the world.

00:29.100 --> 00:31.400
Today is Championship Sunday.

00:31.400 --> 00:37.900
After battling past the rest of the competition, the top 12 players are competing for the title of this year's Pound Champion.

00:37.900 --> 01:04.400
Since this is a double elimination tournament, Hungrybox is kicked down to the losers bracket where he now has to face S2J.

01:04.500 --> 01:08.200
The loser of this set will be out of the tournament in fifth place.

01:21.900 --> 01:26.200
Hungrybox wins and advances to face Zane in the loser semi-finals.

01:26.200 --> 01:30.900
Quickly, Hungrybox finds himself in deep trouble about to fall to an 0-2 deficit.

01:30.900 --> 01:34.200
With his back against the wall, he rebounds to win Game 2.

01:34.200 --> 01:38.200
He narrowly wins the next two games to eliminate Zane at fourth.

02:01.700 --> 02:05.700
Once again, Hungrybox wins, eliminating Plup at third.

02:05.700 --> 02:11.200
After defeating everyone in the losers bracket, Hungrybox has only one competitor left to face.

02:11.200 --> 02:14.700
Mango, the player who sent him down there in the first place.

02:30.900 --> 02:33.900
Mango, the player who sent him down there in the first place.

03:00.900 --> 03:17.900
In their second encounter of the tournament, Hungrybox defeats Mango three games to one to reset the bracket.

03:17.900 --> 03:24.900
Since it's a double elimination tournament, Hungrybox must defeat Mango for a second time to win the tournament.

03:30.900 --> 03:33.900
Mango, the player who sent him down there in the first place.

04:00.900 --> 04:14.900
And there it is! Hungrybox is your pound 2019 Smash Bros. Melee champion.

04:14.900 --> 04:19.900
After an incredible comeback victory, Hungrybox begins to celebrate in front of the stunned crowd.

04:19.900 --> 04:25.900
But unfortunately for him, the celebration he earned is about to be cut very, very short.

04:25.900 --> 04:29.900
Hungrybox is the champion once again.

04:29.900 --> 04:48.900
Just ten seconds after his victory, a disgruntled spectator throws a raw crab at Hungrybox, narrowly missing his head.

04:48.900 --> 04:55.900
In a matter of seconds, Hungrybox is transformed from the most joyful person in the arena to the most miserable.

04:55.900 --> 04:59.900
Most people don't care that much about video games, but some people do.

04:59.900 --> 05:03.900
Out of these people, most don't care about competitive gaming, but some do.

05:03.900 --> 05:11.900
And for all the esports out there, most spectators don't care about watching a 19-year-old game, but still, some do.

05:11.900 --> 05:19.900
And out of those few people, surely no one cares enough about the outcome of a match to throw a raw crab at the winner.

05:19.900 --> 05:23.900
But on this day in Laurel, Maryland, someone did.

05:23.900 --> 05:31.900
As far as I know, this is the only time something like this has ever happened in the history of competitive video games.

05:31.900 --> 05:36.900
But if it was gonna happen, it was probably gonna happen to Hungrybox.

05:36.900 --> 05:38.900
Who is Hungrybox?

05:53.900 --> 06:05.900
Before we can talk about Hungrybox, we have to talk about the game that made his name.

06:05.900 --> 06:14.900
Super Smash Bros. is one of Nintendo's flagship franchises, releasing on every console dating back to its debut on the Nintendo 64.

06:14.900 --> 06:23.900
The game was originally conceived by developer Masahiro Sakurai, who was interested in creating a four-player fighting game with Nintendo's most iconic characters.

06:23.900 --> 06:33.900
Despite his vision, Sakurai prepared to field the game with generic fighters, as he never anticipated that Nintendo would approve of their flagship characters in such uncharted territory.

06:33.900 --> 06:43.900
However, much to his surprise, Nintendo greenlit the most ambitious crossover event in history, and Super Smash Bros. was born from the defiance of expectations.

06:44.900 --> 06:51.900
Super Smash Bros.

06:51.900 --> 06:56.900
The game released in 1999 to a warm reception from critics and audiences alike.

06:56.900 --> 07:04.900
While the novelty of barbarically pummeling beloved childhood mascots drew people into Smash, the game's unique mechanics kept them playing.

07:04.900 --> 07:10.900
When first conceiving of the game, Sakurai wanted Smash to stand out from the typical 2D fighters of the era.

07:10.900 --> 07:14.900
And he accomplished this with the game's fundamental objective.

07:14.900 --> 07:22.900
In standard fighting games, players damage each other to deplete a health bar, and you win the game by lowering your opponent's health to zero.

07:22.900 --> 07:31.900
Super Smash Bros. alters this formula by instead programming damage to increase knockback and setting the win condition to launching your opponent off-screen.

07:33.900 --> 07:39.900
This relatively simple change produced radically different gameplay from other fighting games.

07:39.900 --> 07:52.900
Instead of prioritizing complex button combinations and precise spacing, Smash places much more emphasis on movement, platforming, and stage positioning, mechanics that were rarely considered in other fighting games at the time.

07:52.900 --> 08:05.900
While developing Smash, Sakurai wanted to offer the player a new experience with each session, and in doing so, created a game with incredibly divergent outcomes, resulting in dynamic, unpredictable gameplay.

08:05.900 --> 08:09.900
But most importantly, a game that's very hard to figure out.

08:09.900 --> 08:13.900
This design philosophy would serve as the blueprint for the series going forward.

08:13.900 --> 08:21.900
And while Smash 64 brought a lot of ideas to the table, the concept wouldn't realize its full potential until its successor, Melee.

08:36.900 --> 08:43.900
It seems as if Super Smash Bros. Melee has always been in a race against time, going all the way back to its development.

08:43.900 --> 08:57.900
After the success of Smash 64, Sakurai was tasked with developing its sequel in time for the debut of Nintendo's new console, the GameCube, giving the team at HAL Laboratory just 13 months to complete its most daunting project yet.

08:57.900 --> 09:03.900
After an exhaustive development cycle, the result was an accidental masterpiece.

09:03.900 --> 09:09.900
Compared to its predecessor, Melee was much faster. Faster movement, faster attacks, faster combos.

09:09.900 --> 09:14.900
The rapid pace of the game contributed to incredibly dynamic and unpredictable combat.

09:14.900 --> 09:18.900
Melee offers the player an immense degree of control over their character.

09:18.900 --> 09:23.900
Mechanically speaking, Sakurai described Melee as the sharpest in the series.

09:23.900 --> 09:27.900
Players seemed to agree, as upon release, Melee was a smash hit.

09:27.900 --> 09:33.900
However, despite the game's tight presentation, Melee would go on to be defined by its loose ends.

09:33.900 --> 09:37.900
The game's hasty development allowed a few oversights to slip through the cracks.

09:37.900 --> 09:43.900
In due time, players would begin to discover numerous exploits to gain a competitive edge over their opponents.

09:43.900 --> 09:51.900
Combined with Melee's already fast gameplay, these techniques were able to transform an already good game into a masterpiece.

09:57.900 --> 10:09.900
Super Smash Bros. Melee was, without a doubt, a very successful casual game,

10:09.900 --> 10:14.900
but its unique mechanics set the foundation for one of the greatest competitive games of all time.

10:14.900 --> 10:20.900
The discovery of such advanced tactics would push the game's potential beyond what anyone thought was possible.

10:20.900 --> 10:25.900
Shortly after the game's release, local Melee tournaments began to spring up everywhere,

10:25.900 --> 10:30.900
and thousands of players began contending for the title of the best Melee player in the world.

10:30.900 --> 10:35.900
Starting in 2004, Major League Gaming would sponsor Melee on its Pro Circuit,

10:35.900 --> 10:40.900
incentivizing the highest level of competition with thousands of dollars in prize money.

10:40.900 --> 10:44.900
As tournaments became more prestigious, so too did the players.

10:44.900 --> 10:48.900
Captain Jack, Isaiah, and Azen emerged as Melee's top contenders,

10:48.900 --> 10:54.900
but no early player was better than Ken, the undisputed king of Smash.

10:54.900 --> 11:01.900
From 2003 to 2005, he won almost every tournament he entered, beating Melee's best competition along the way.

11:01.900 --> 11:07.900
Around 2006, new challengers like PC Chris and Korean DJ began closing the gap.

11:07.900 --> 11:13.900
Ken retained his crown all the way through 2007, where Melee made its first appearance at EVO.

11:13.900 --> 11:16.900
After battling through Melee's biggest tournament yet,

11:16.900 --> 11:21.900
Ken would once again emerge victorious in what many at the time considered to be Melee's last hurrah.

11:25.900 --> 11:32.900
In competitive video games, it's customary for players to compete in the latest version of their franchise.

11:32.900 --> 11:39.900
After seven years as the GameCube's most popular title, Melee was scheduled to be supplanted by the next Smash game.

11:42.900 --> 11:47.900
As the franchise moved to the Wii, the competitive Melee scene was expected to follow.

11:47.900 --> 11:51.900
However, following one of the most anticipated releases in video game history,

11:51.900 --> 11:55.900
Super Smash Bros. Brawl was not at all what people expected.

11:58.900 --> 12:04.900
The combat was slow and plodding. Lower hitstun severely limited the potential of comboing.

12:04.900 --> 12:09.900
Advanced tactics like wave dashing were replaced with punishing mechanics like tripping,

12:09.900 --> 12:12.900
where the game would randomly stun players for dashing.

12:12.900 --> 12:18.900
Oh, wow. Wow. And you hate to see that kind of thing happen. Oh, you stupid son of a...

12:19.900 --> 12:20.900
What?

12:20.900 --> 12:26.900
Needless to say, the sluggish pace of Brawl was a drastic change from the fast-paced precision of Melee.

12:26.900 --> 12:32.900
Supposedly, Sakurai felt that Melee's highly technical execution made the game too difficult for casual play,

12:32.900 --> 12:37.900
and he worked to make the sequel much more simple and accessible for new players.

12:37.900 --> 12:41.900
While Brawl succeeded as a casual game, it suffered competitively.

12:41.900 --> 12:44.900
Many of Melee's top players tried to give Brawl a chance.

12:44.900 --> 12:50.900
One year after his final Melee victory, Ken would return to the finals of EVO playing Brawl,

12:50.900 --> 12:54.900
where he would be promptly beaten by a 14-year-old kid.

12:54.900 --> 12:57.900
The player who beat him had no prior tournament experience,

12:57.900 --> 13:02.900
and he only entered because his family just happened to be vacationing near the venue at the time.

13:02.900 --> 13:07.900
The tournament result was viewed as a total farce by the competitive Smash community.

13:07.900 --> 13:12.900
The fact that essentially a random player could score a fluke win against a skilled veteran like Ken

13:12.900 --> 13:16.900
served as an indictment against Brawl as a competitive game.

13:16.900 --> 13:22.900
With all this considered, it didn't take long before many of Melee's competitors soured on the new Smash game.

13:22.900 --> 13:27.900
For the first time ever, the Smash community was divided over the future of the franchise.

13:27.900 --> 13:31.900
In an era before esports were commonplace in online culture,

13:31.900 --> 13:37.900
many fans struggled to accept Smash Bros. as anything beyond its original role as a party game.

13:37.900 --> 13:43.900
Most were prepared to write off Melee as a stale, dead game with nothing left to figure out,

13:43.900 --> 13:47.900
and the vast majority of players were ready to move on with the series.

13:47.900 --> 13:53.900
Only a small, ragtag community would stay behind in what they considered to be the better game.

13:53.900 --> 13:58.900
And luckily for them, this 7-year-old title was still very much alive.

14:01.900 --> 14:08.900
Right now we are in the Atlanta airport, and it's like 7, 3rd in the morning.

14:08.900 --> 14:12.900
It's cold. I'm wearing a jacket, so it's not Florida.

14:19.900 --> 14:24.900
Hungrybox started entering local Melee tournaments in the summer of 2007.

14:24.900 --> 14:29.900
In just a few months, he started regularly placing in the top 5.

14:29.900 --> 14:32.900
And by the next year, he started winning.

14:32.900 --> 14:37.900
As HBox kept playing, he found himself conquering tougher and tougher competition.

14:37.900 --> 14:43.900
In 2009, he entered Revival of Melee, the game's first major tournament since the release of Brawl.

14:43.900 --> 14:48.900
Facing off against the best in the nation, Hungrybox placed 7th.

14:48.900 --> 14:51.900
Four months later at Genesis, he placed 3rd.

14:51.900 --> 14:55.900
Two months after that at Tipton 5, he won.

14:55.900 --> 15:01.900
Just two years after he started competing, Hungrybox was already contending for the title of Best in the World.

15:01.900 --> 15:08.900
But in addition to his individual success, HBox was arguably taking part in something much more important.

15:08.900 --> 15:13.900
The rise of Hungrybox was indicative of a new generation of Melee.

15:13.900 --> 15:17.900
By 2010, the old legends of yesteryear had pretty much vanished.

15:17.900 --> 15:21.900
Like most of the old community, they had moved on to new frontiers.

15:21.900 --> 15:27.900
The departure of Melee's old generation left new top players the opportunity to usher in a new era.

15:27.900 --> 15:36.900
In January 2010, the Pound 4 tournament would mark the beginning of a period in Melee's history known as the Era of the Five Gods.

15:36.900 --> 15:40.900
Specifically serving as the first tournament with all five gods in attendance.

15:40.900 --> 15:45.900
The story of Melee's gods begins with the first god, Mewtwo King.

15:45.900 --> 15:50.900
Beginning in 2005, Mewtwo King would eventually rise and defeat Melee's old legends.

15:50.900 --> 15:56.900
Mewtwo King's Melee ascent was due almost entirely to his pioneering research into the game's combat.

15:56.900 --> 16:07.900
Frame data, character matchups, KO percentages, information that's readily accessible today was originally discovered by Mewtwo King's exhaustive exploration of Melee's mechanics.

16:07.900 --> 16:12.900
And for many years, no player knew more about the game than Mewtwo King.

16:12.900 --> 16:17.900
In 2008, Mewtwo King was widely regarded as the top player in both Melee and Brawl.

16:18.900 --> 16:24.900
To this day, he remains the only player to achieve the concurrent title of Best in the World in two different Smash games.

16:24.900 --> 16:31.900
And as impressive as this accomplishment was, it meant that Mewtwo King's attention was divided among two very different games.

16:31.900 --> 16:34.900
Leaving the door open for many to challenge his throne.

16:34.900 --> 16:42.900
The second of Melee's gods to rise to power would be Mango, who, by 2009, would overtake Mewtwo King as the top Melee player.

16:42.900 --> 16:49.900
Throughout the history of Melee, many would argue that no player had a more intuitive understanding of the game than Mango.

16:49.900 --> 16:54.900
Watching Mango perform at his highest level is an experience unlike anything else in Melee.

16:54.900 --> 17:01.900
The way he could effortlessly string together complex combos led to a style that was as fluid as it was unstoppable.

17:01.900 --> 17:06.900
At times, the only thing that could stop him was how much he was willing to try.

17:06.900 --> 17:10.900
Mango's exciting and aggressive playstyle made him a consummate fan favorite.

17:10.900 --> 17:15.900
Especially through his iconic clashes with Melee's third god, Armada.

17:15.900 --> 17:23.900
As Europe's best player, Armada carried the weight of a whole continent on his shoulders as he traveled to prove himself in the United States.

17:23.900 --> 17:29.900
Historically, Melee's competitive scene has viewed Europe as a significantly weaker region than North America.

17:29.900 --> 17:34.900
A stigma that was often used by Americans to invalidate the success of European players.

17:34.900 --> 17:40.900
Armada would defy everyone's expectations by immediately contending with America's best.

17:40.900 --> 17:46.900
His unrivaled dedication and consistency would make him one of the most formidable opponents Melee had ever seen.

17:46.900 --> 17:52.900
Hungrybox established himself as Melee's fourth god through his meteoric rise in 2009.

17:52.900 --> 17:59.900
And last but not least, Melee's new generation would be cemented through the rise of the fifth god, Dr. PeePee.

17:59.900 --> 18:05.900
Although he was the last to develop, PeePeeMD would quickly rise to the highest level of competition.

18:05.900 --> 18:11.900
PeePee's style relied on tactical execution to pick apart his opponents with surgical precision.

18:11.900 --> 18:16.900
When the doctor was in, you were about to be prescribed your daily dose of destruction.

18:18.900 --> 18:25.900
These are Melee's five gods. Now that we've introduced who they are, we can talk about what they are.

18:25.900 --> 18:31.900
Carrying the title of god in any game entails a great deal of prestige, and Smash Bros is no exception.

18:31.900 --> 18:35.900
So what exactly did these five players do to transcend us lowly mortals?

18:35.900 --> 18:41.900
It's unknown who exactly introduced the term five gods to describe Melee's top players,

18:41.900 --> 18:45.900
but the expression started seeing frequent use in the summer of 2014,

18:45.900 --> 18:49.900
most likely used to describe the era of supreme dominance that preceded it.

18:49.900 --> 18:55.900
From 2009 to 2015, a member of the five gods would win every major tournament,

18:55.900 --> 18:59.900
utterly dismantling the rest of the competition in the process.

18:59.900 --> 19:06.900
In any competitive sport or game, it's typical to have one or two elite players win a lion's share of the competitions.

19:06.900 --> 19:11.900
Chess, for example, has witnessed Magnus Carlsen dominate the competition for the past six years.

19:11.900 --> 19:18.900
A rarer case is currently on display in tennis, which has seen three players dominate major tournaments over the past decade.

19:18.900 --> 19:24.900
A competitive game with five elite players occupying the same era is almost unheard of,

19:24.900 --> 19:31.900
but if such an unlikely event were to occur, it's somewhat fitting that it would happen in a game used to defying expectations.

19:31.900 --> 19:36.900
As the legend goes, Melee's five gods would hardly ever lose to any other players,

19:36.900 --> 19:40.900
and all were capable of defeating each other in any given competition,

19:40.900 --> 19:43.900
but just how much better were the gods than everyone else?

19:43.900 --> 19:48.900
Well, as a reminder, I like to recall two cases involving the player Hax,

19:48.900 --> 19:52.900
a skilled competitor known for his flashy combos and lightning-quick execution.

19:52.900 --> 19:58.900
In 2013, Hax was ranked as the number six player in the world, the best of the non-gods.

19:58.900 --> 20:03.900
He would remain a perennial top ten player until his hiatus in 2015.

20:03.900 --> 20:07.900
In a 2014 tournament, Hax faced off in a set against PPMD.

20:07.900 --> 20:11.900
In the first game, he got three-stocked in about two and a half minutes.

20:13.900 --> 20:24.900
In the second game, he got four-stocked in 68 seconds.

20:34.900 --> 20:39.900
Later that year, Hax would compete in a set against Mango, which Mango would win three games to one.

20:39.900 --> 20:45.900
Not the most impressive result, until you realize that Mango doesn't actually main Marth or Captain Falcon.

20:45.900 --> 20:48.900
That's just the difference between a good player and a god.

20:48.900 --> 20:52.900
Even when you're good, you're a long way from the best.

20:58.900 --> 21:04.900
At one point, the gods were so far above the rest of the competition that they could even win with their secondary characters.

21:04.900 --> 21:08.900
Now would probably be a good time to talk about Melee's characters.

21:08.900 --> 21:13.900
Out of all the Smash games, Melee may have the most interesting character composition.

21:13.900 --> 21:17.900
Some Smash games have one or two characters that outright dominate the meta,

21:17.900 --> 21:21.900
with the most obvious example being Brawl's aptly named Meta Knight,

21:21.900 --> 21:26.900
a character so blatantly overpowered that some tournaments chose to ban him entirely.

21:26.900 --> 21:30.900
On the other hand, the best Melee character has always been kind of tough to figure out.

21:30.900 --> 21:36.900
To put it simply, about a third of Melee's roster are completely unusable in a competitive setting.

21:36.900 --> 21:41.900
Another third are just kind of bad, and the last third are all capable of winning tournaments.

21:41.900 --> 21:47.900
To this day, the community remains largely undecided on which character is actually the best,

21:47.900 --> 21:52.900
a debate that can be traced all the way back to the beginning of the game through the history of Melee's tier lists.

21:52.900 --> 22:01.900
That's right, this widespread facet of modern internet discourse originated from the niche purpose of categorizing characters in fighting games.

22:01.900 --> 22:07.900
In the early days of Melee, Sheik was considered the best character with her rapid attacks and movement.

22:07.900 --> 22:13.900
As the meta progressed through the rest of the 2000s, more characters would emerge as top-tier contenders.

22:13.900 --> 22:18.900
Peach with her strong aerial attacks, Marth with his chain grabs and huge spacing,

22:18.900 --> 22:23.900
Captain Falcon with his heavy combos, the Ice Climbers with their infinite combo,

22:23.900 --> 22:27.900
and the space animals Fox and Falco with their great mobility and high damage.

22:27.900 --> 22:29.900
And then there's Puff.

22:31.900 --> 22:40.900
In any competitive video game, your character is far more important than just a colorful avatar.

22:40.900 --> 22:45.900
It's an extension of the self and an integral part of a player's identity.

22:45.900 --> 22:51.900
In Melee, perhaps no player is more intertwined with a character than Hungrybox and his Jigglypuff.

22:51.900 --> 22:55.900
Jigglypuff is the most confounding character in all of Melee.

22:55.900 --> 22:59.900
She arguably should have never existed as a Smash character at all.

22:59.900 --> 23:03.900
Puff is not even among the most popular characters in her own franchise,

23:03.900 --> 23:08.900
but she wound up in Smash anyway because of her similar character design to Kirby.

23:08.900 --> 23:15.900
The Smash 64 developers would recycle Kirby's character model and animations to fill out the game's 12th and final character slot.

23:15.900 --> 23:21.900
And thus, the balloon Pokemon would remain as a mainstay for the rest of the franchise.

23:21.900 --> 23:25.900
At a glance, Jigglypuff in Melee seems like a rather mediocre character.

23:25.900 --> 23:30.900
She has five jumps and great mobility, but her ground game leaves much to be desired.

23:30.900 --> 23:34.900
Most of her attacks do unimpressive damage and have a short range.

23:34.900 --> 23:39.900
Combined with the slowest dash speed in the game, Puff has a hard time approaching other characters.

23:39.900 --> 23:43.900
Two of her special attacks are practically useless in a competitive setting.

23:43.900 --> 23:47.900
She's the second lightest character with the slowest falling speed,

23:47.900 --> 23:51.900
meaning she tends to die much faster than any other character in the game.

23:51.900 --> 23:56.900
With all this considered, it's difficult to imagine this character seeing any kind of competitive success.

23:56.900 --> 24:01.900
This sentiment was echoed during the early parts of the game with Melee's inaugural tier list,

24:01.900 --> 24:05.900
which placed Jigglypuff firmly in the bottom half of the cast.

24:05.900 --> 24:11.900
However, as the game progressed, the Melee community found that Puff was a lot better than what they initially anticipated,

24:11.900 --> 24:14.900
due in large part to two moves.

24:14.900 --> 24:17.900
Back air is Jigglypuff's strongest aerial attack.

24:17.900 --> 24:23.900
Thanks to a disjointed hitbox, this move provides Jigglypuff with her only powerful ranged option.

24:23.900 --> 24:29.900
Its relatively low end lag makes it spammable, granting Puff her only real way to space out opponents.

24:29.900 --> 24:35.900
And while back air may be Puff's most versatile move, it doesn't come close to her most game-changing move.

24:42.900 --> 24:44.900
The premise of rest is quite simple.

24:44.900 --> 24:50.900
Hitting the move deals massive damage and knockback, killing most characters at very low percents.

24:50.900 --> 24:55.900
Missing the move will stun you for three seconds, basically guaranteeing your own demise.

24:55.900 --> 24:59.900
Scoring a rest is very difficult due to the move's small hitbox,

24:59.900 --> 25:03.900
basically requiring Puff to be on top of the opponent's character to connect.

25:03.900 --> 25:10.900
But at the highest level of competition, the threat of getting rested forces other characters to treat Puff like a ticking time bomb.

25:10.900 --> 25:16.900
Rest prevents opponents from aggressively rushing down Puff and smothering her with their otherwise superior attacks.

25:16.900 --> 25:23.900
It forces other players to back down and keep their distance, as one slip-up could lead to devastating consequences.

25:23.900 --> 25:27.900
Throughout the 2000s, players would begin to discover the power of Puff,

25:27.900 --> 25:33.900
and the character would gradually move up Melee's tier list, peaking at number three overall in 2010,

25:33.900 --> 25:38.900
after Hungrybox and Mango showed that Puff could dominate at the highest level.

25:38.900 --> 25:44.900
However, on the cusp of what looked to be a Jigglypuff uprising, the character was about to run into a major roadblock.

25:44.900 --> 25:49.900
Midway through 2010, Mango unexpectedly dropped Puff as his main,

25:49.900 --> 25:53.900
choosing instead to move forward with Fox and Falco.

25:53.900 --> 25:59.900
Mango's character swap marked the beginning of a trend in Melee that would go on to be known as 20XX.

26:08.900 --> 26:21.900
By 2011, the Melee metagame had undergone more than ten years of evolution,

26:21.900 --> 26:24.900
and its combat was starting to get very optimized.

26:24.900 --> 26:30.900
For Melee's community, no character represented the game's optimization more than Fox.

26:30.900 --> 26:35.900
Ever since the beginning, Fox was always considered to be a character with incredible potential,

26:35.900 --> 26:41.900
but no one could truly harness it until the metagame had progressed beyond a high enough threshold of technical skill.

26:41.900 --> 26:46.900
To put it simply, Fox in Melee is the fastest character in the fastest Smash game.

26:46.900 --> 26:53.900
If played perfectly, Fox's rapid movement and attacks should theoretically overwhelm any other character in the game.

26:53.900 --> 26:58.900
Optimal execution with Fox pushes the limits of what's humanly possible with a controller,

26:58.900 --> 27:03.900
but that wouldn't stop many players from seeking the holy grail of peak Melee performance.

27:03.900 --> 27:07.900
One of those players was Hax, the originator of the 20XX meme,

27:07.900 --> 27:12.900
and widely regarded as the best Captain Falcon player in the world before switching to Fox,

27:12.900 --> 27:17.900
much to the dismay of Captain Falcon fans who viewed the switch as a betrayal.

27:17.900 --> 27:22.900
Mango's infamous set versus Hax supposedly came as a result of Mango trying to teach Hax a lesson

27:22.900 --> 27:26.900
that Fox was not quite the Melee messiah that everyone envisioned.

27:26.900 --> 27:32.900
Some of you may see this as ironic since Mango himself abandoned his original character for Fox,

27:32.900 --> 27:36.900
but it starts to make more sense when you consider the scale of sickness.

27:36.900 --> 27:41.900
The Melee community loves to throw around this idea of players and characters being sick.

27:41.900 --> 27:48.900
A sick character roughly translates to a character being cool, dynamic, and generally fun to watch and play.

27:48.900 --> 27:54.900
Arguably more important than Melee's tier list is its sick list, which by my estimate looks something like this.

27:54.900 --> 27:59.900
You see, Hax switching from Falcon to Fox may have improved his standing on the tier list,

27:59.900 --> 28:04.900
but he kicked himself down a peg on the sick list and the move was somewhat unpopular.

28:04.900 --> 28:10.900
On the other hand, when Mango switched from Puff to Fox, he upgraded his sickness by a huge margin

28:10.900 --> 28:15.900
because in the realm of Melee, no character is lamer than Jigglypuff.

28:16.900 --> 28:32.900
For many fans of the game, Jigglypuff represents the antithesis of everything that makes Melee great.

28:32.900 --> 28:36.900
She requires lower technical skill than the rest of the high-tier characters.

28:36.900 --> 28:42.900
She's floaty and hard to combo, her playstyle is inherently slow, campy, and defensive.

28:42.900 --> 28:46.900
Spectators often accuse her of being boring to watch and play.

28:46.900 --> 28:52.900
These are many of the same points that Melee players use to claim why Brawl is an inferior successor.

28:52.900 --> 28:58.900
And yet, sitting right inside their otherwise flawless masterpiece is a little pink blemish.

28:58.900 --> 29:03.900
For this fundamental incongruity, Jigglypuff is Melee's black sheep.

29:03.900 --> 29:08.900
But even the most despised character in all of Melee can still find support from some players.

29:08.900 --> 29:14.900
One of those people was Hungrybox, who all of a sudden found himself as the number one Jigglypuff player in the world.

29:14.900 --> 29:21.900
Unlike Mango, who had always demonstrated proficiency with a variety of characters, Hungrybox only played Puff.

29:21.900 --> 29:27.900
Whether it was out of loyalty or necessity, Hungrybox would show up year after year, game after game,

29:27.900 --> 29:30.900
rain or shine with the same tried and true character.

29:30.900 --> 29:34.900
Most Melee players consider Jigglypuff to have a solid matchup spread,

29:34.900 --> 29:38.900
having winning or even matchups with most of the other high-tier characters.

29:38.900 --> 29:43.900
But without a doubt, Jigglypuff's most difficult matchup comes against Fox,

29:43.900 --> 29:48.900
whose powerful vertical attacks are capable of launching Puff into the stratosphere at low percents.

29:48.900 --> 29:52.900
Fox vs. Puff is quite possibly Melee's most intriguing matchup,

29:52.900 --> 29:56.900
pitting the strongest offensive character against the strongest defensive character.

29:56.900 --> 30:00.900
For ages, Fox stood mightily as Jigglypuff's only hard counter.

30:00.900 --> 30:06.900
And as Fox began to dominate Melee's meta, the game was about to get a lot harder for Hungrybox.

30:10.900 --> 30:14.900
By 2011, the era of the Five Gods was well underway.

30:14.900 --> 30:20.900
Despite H-Fox's impressive 2010, his tournament results would stumble a bit in the following years.

30:20.900 --> 30:24.900
He would grab the occasional first place at smaller events,

30:24.900 --> 30:28.900
but would struggle to win at tournaments with more than one other god in attendance.

30:28.900 --> 30:32.900
Although around this time, he hardly had much of an opportunity.

30:32.900 --> 30:35.900
Melee was still very much in the midst of a competitive Dark Age,

30:35.900 --> 30:39.900
and nationally organized tournaments were few and far between.

30:39.900 --> 30:43.900
Despite its small underground following, the Melee community held steady,

30:43.900 --> 30:48.900
persisting through sparse events and prize money fueled almost entirely by the love of the game itself.

30:48.900 --> 30:52.900
Their patience would pay off when, unbeknownst to anyone at the time,

30:52.900 --> 30:55.900
Melee would once again be thrust into the spotlight.

30:58.900 --> 31:02.900
2013 was arguably the most influential year in Melee's history,

31:02.900 --> 31:06.900
a year that was marked by three monumental events.

31:06.900 --> 31:11.900
2013 oversaw the release of Project M, one of the most ambitious video game mods of all time,

31:11.900 --> 31:16.900
which sought to reimagine what Brawl could have been had it retained Melee's fast-paced mechanics.

31:16.900 --> 31:22.900
For the first time ever, Melee players could enjoy what they felt was a true sequel to Melee.

31:22.900 --> 31:29.900
Also in 2013, independent filmmaker Travis Beauchamp would release the Smash Bros. documentary to critical acclaim.

31:29.900 --> 31:33.900
The film would bring unprecedented exposure to Melee's underground scene,

31:33.900 --> 31:37.900
and would go on to inspire a new generation of players to compete in the coming years.

31:37.900 --> 31:43.900
But without a doubt, 2013 saw perhaps the most important event in the history of competitive Melee,

31:43.900 --> 31:49.900
where after six long years of slumber, Super Smash Bros. Melee would return to EVO.

31:49.900 --> 31:52.900
The announcement quickly drew in over 700 competitors,

31:52.900 --> 31:56.900
making EVO 2013 the biggest Melee tournament to date.

31:56.900 --> 32:01.900
And heading into the event, all eyes shifted towards the five gods of the game.

32:19.900 --> 32:37.900
2-0

32:37.900 --> 33:06.900
To everyone's surprise, Hungrybox found himself in winners' finals of Melee's most important tournament to date.

33:06.900 --> 33:12.900
Even more shocking was his opponent, Wobbles, an Ice Climbers player in the twilight of his career

33:12.900 --> 33:17.900
who managed to slay two gods on his way to one of the most improbable runs in Melee history.

33:17.900 --> 33:21.900
Hungrybox was in prime position to become EVO champion.

33:21.900 --> 33:24.900
All he had to do was beat Wobbles in a favorable character matchup,

33:24.900 --> 33:29.900
and then win just one more set in grand finals, and he would claim Melee's most coveted title.

33:54.900 --> 34:19.900
Astoundingly, Wobbles did the unthinkable by conquering a third god in a row.

34:19.900 --> 34:24.900
To make matters worse for HBox, the moment he lost, he didn't even know that he had.

34:24.900 --> 34:50.900
After this discouraging moment, Hungrybox had to imagine that his golden opportunity to claim the EVO crown had slipped right through his fingers.

34:50.900 --> 34:54.900
The rest, as they say, is history.

35:21.900 --> 35:26.900
We may never know just how influential Mango's EVO 2013 win was,

35:26.900 --> 35:34.900
but the game's most popular player winning its biggest event was enough to catapult Melee out of the Dark Ages and into a renaissance.

35:34.900 --> 35:42.900
It breathed new life into the game as a competitive spectacle during a time when esports were just beginning to enter the public consciousness.

35:42.900 --> 35:48.900
In the coming years, viewership, attendance, sponsorships, and prize money would skyrocket.

35:48.900 --> 35:52.900
After EVO 2013, Melee would never be the same.

35:52.900 --> 35:56.900
While the game was booming, Hungrybox was slumping.

35:56.900 --> 36:02.900
With his loss at EVO, HBox only added to his three-year-long major tournament losing streak,

36:02.900 --> 36:09.900
and he did so in gut-wrenching fashion, not just getting upset by Wobbles, but also handing the tournament win to Mango,

36:09.900 --> 36:13.900
who was, at the time, Hungrybox's biggest rival.

36:13.900 --> 36:18.900
Following his EVO victory, Mango hosted a now infamous Reddit AMA,

36:18.900 --> 36:24.900
on which Hungrybox voiced some scathing remarks about how Mango had disrespected him for his entire career.

36:24.900 --> 36:27.900
Mango's response? Come up and get me.

36:33.900 --> 36:38.900
2013 also saw the release of Melee's first annual player rankings.

36:38.900 --> 36:43.900
Mango, following his monumental win at EVO, scored the number one rank.

36:43.900 --> 36:48.900
Hungrybox, in a lackluster year, sat fifth, the worst of the best.

36:48.900 --> 36:53.900
As 2014 rolled around, things would only get more tumultuous for Hungrybox.

36:53.900 --> 36:58.900
This was the year that 20XX began to tip the scales of the Melee metagame.

36:58.900 --> 37:06.900
In addition to the other gods of the game, Hungrybox now had to face a rising generation of highly technical Fox players like Hax, Leffen, and Lucky.

37:06.900 --> 37:11.900
With each tournament, the Puff main was dealing with more threats than ever before.

37:11.900 --> 37:17.900
If the Fox revolution wasn't enough, Hbox also faced challenges that few others could have anticipated.

37:17.900 --> 37:22.900
During this time, Armada would frequently thwart Hbox by using Young Link,

37:22.900 --> 37:26.900
an obscure mid-tier who was only really viable at countering Puff.

37:26.900 --> 37:34.900
Hungrybox's losing streak would continue deep into 2014, where he would once again enter EVO in desperate need of a win.

37:34.900 --> 37:39.900
In his most impressive performance of the year, Hungrybox would play valiantly,

37:39.900 --> 37:43.900
beating PPMD and finally vanquishing Armada's Young Link,

37:43.900 --> 37:48.900
only to be double eliminated by Mango, who won the tournament for the second year in a row.

37:48.900 --> 37:53.900
What Hungrybox lacked in winning, he made up for with his flair for the dramatic.

38:05.900 --> 38:13.900
Around this time, Hungrybox started developing a penchant for making ridiculous comebacks.

38:13.900 --> 38:19.900
These clutch displays reminded everyone of his skill, and earned him the moniker of Clutchbox.

38:19.900 --> 38:24.900
But improbable comebacks weren't the only dramatic traits of Hbox's play.

38:24.900 --> 38:29.900
Much like his in-game character, Hbox too was a bit theatrical and emotional.

38:29.900 --> 38:35.900
During this time, he was most often characterized by his explosive pop-offs after close wins.

38:35.900 --> 38:40.900
Perhaps it was his way of confronting the growing pressure from Melee's new wave of spectators.

38:40.900 --> 38:46.900
The combination of his god status and defensive playstyle caused many fans to actively root against him.

38:46.900 --> 38:53.900
By the summer of 2014, Melee was no longer just a ragtag bunch of players competing mostly for bragging rights.

38:53.900 --> 38:59.900
It was becoming a legitimate esport, with its players falling under the scrutiny of thousands of spectators.

38:59.900 --> 39:04.900
You have to imagine that any player would have a tough time adjusting to such a drastic change,

39:04.900 --> 39:10.900
especially in Hungrybox's case where, more often than not, the crowd was firmly against him.

39:10.900 --> 39:18.900
2014 marked a year of tremendous growth and change for Melee, but Hungrybox ended the year exactly where he started, ranked fifth.

39:18.900 --> 39:24.900
After a disappointing finish at the Big House, some began to question whether he still deserved his god status,

39:24.900 --> 39:28.900
or if it was even worth it for him to continue sticking to Jigglypuff.

39:28.900 --> 39:34.900
Fortunately for Hungrybox, the world of Melee was about to realize that he performed the best under pressure.

39:48.900 --> 39:59.900
Here we go.

39:59.900 --> 40:02.900
And Mew2King gives up Game 1.

40:02.900 --> 40:06.900
You know, I really feel like Hungrybox's tag is applicable. Bruh.

40:13.900 --> 40:17.900
Back air? Oh, that's gonna be it. Yeah, he's double back air.

40:17.900 --> 40:21.900
Wow, and look at Mew2King. Mew2King is so upset.

40:23.900 --> 40:25.900
Oh, he's way up there and he takes it easy.

40:25.900 --> 40:29.900
And that is it. Beautiful job. Hungrybox beats Mew2King yet again.

40:29.900 --> 40:34.900
Hungrybox opened 2015 with a bang by winning Paragon Orlando in dominant fashion.

40:34.900 --> 40:42.900
At long last, HBox won a tournament with multiple other gods in attendance, snapping a losing streak dating back to 2010.

40:42.900 --> 40:49.900
The celebration would not last long, however, as through his victory, Hungrybox had just awoken a sleeping giant.

40:49.900 --> 40:52.900
That's it. Good night. Wow.

40:52.900 --> 40:55.900
And just like that, Hungrybox up 2-0.

40:55.900 --> 40:58.900
Fox? Did I hear Fox? I heard Fox.

40:58.900 --> 41:02.900
Okay, let's see what Armada can do here.

41:05.900 --> 41:13.900
Throughout the rise of Fox in the Melee metagame, Armada was one of the few remaining holdouts who did not pick up Fox in any capacity.

41:14.900 --> 41:20.900
That all changed in 2015 when he determined that solo maining Peach was no longer a viable option.

41:20.900 --> 41:26.900
Over the past several years, Hungrybox had been slowly but surely improving at the Puff-Fox matchup.

41:26.900 --> 41:31.900
The abundance of Fox players in the meta gave Hungrybox a matchup nightmare at first,

41:31.900 --> 41:35.900
but it also provided him with plenty of practice to learn how to counter it.

41:35.900 --> 41:42.900
The prior years of frustration gave him enough experience to turn a daunting matchup into an increasingly winnable one.

41:42.900 --> 41:47.900
Armada's Fox, however, was different than anything Hungrybox had ever seen before.

41:47.900 --> 41:54.900
It was as technical as any other players, but matched the patience and discipline of Hungrybox's own playstyle.

41:54.900 --> 42:00.900
Following Paragon, Armada's Fox would beat Hungrybox at Apex 2015, then again at Sandstorm.

42:00.900 --> 42:06.900
After the character change, H-Box would fall to Armada 7 out of the next 8 sets they played.

42:06.900 --> 42:10.900
But despite this new setback, Hungrybox was rising.

42:10.900 --> 42:16.900
His tournament results were gradually improving, but more importantly, he learned how to adapt to the spotlight.

42:16.900 --> 42:22.900
2015 featured the debut of Heal Hungrybox, where he learned to embrace his role as Melee's villain.

42:30.900 --> 42:35.900
Hungrybox developed a cocky, brazen persona that he used to taunt hostile audiences.

42:35.900 --> 42:40.900
And perhaps no other tournament showcased Heal H-Box better than EVO 2015,

42:40.900 --> 42:44.900
where, for the third year in a row, Hungrybox faced off against Mango.

43:05.900 --> 43:35.900
Mango, Mango, Mango, Mango, Mango, Mango, Mango, Mango, Mango, Mango, Mango, Mango, Mango, Mango, Mango, Mango, Mango, Mango, Mango, Mango, Mango, Mango, Mango, Mango, Mango, Mango, Mango, Mango, Mango, Mango, Mango, Mango, Mango, Mango, Mango, Mango, Mango, Mango, Mango, Mango, Mango, Mango, Mango, Mango, Mango, Mango, Mango, Mango, Mango, Mango, Mango, Mango, Mango, Mango, Mango, Mango, Mango, Mango, Mango, Mango, Mango, Mango, Mango, Mango, Mango, Mango, Mango, Mango, Mango, Mango, Mango, Mango, Mango, Mango, M

43:35.900 --> 44:05.900
Mango, Mango, Mango, Mango, Mango, Mango, Mango, Mango, Mango, Mango, Mango, Mango, Mango, Mango, Mango, Mango, Mango, Mango, Mango, Mango, Mango, Mango, Mango, Mango, Mango, Mango, Mango, Mango, Mango, Mango, Mango, Mango, Mango, Mango, Mango, Mango, Mango, Mango, Mango, Mango, Mango, Mango, Mango, Mango, Mango, Mango, Mango, Mango, Mango, Mango, Mango, Mango, Mango, Mango, Mango, Mango, Mango, Mango, Mango, Mango, Mango, Mango, Mango, Mango, Mango, Mango, Mango, Mango, Mango, Mango, Mango, Mango, Mango, Mango, M

44:05.900 --> 44:35.900
Hungrybox would then go on to beat PPMD and return to EVO Grand Finals before losing once more to Armada's Fox. Although he equaled his placement from the prior year, EVO 2015 felt different. Hungrybox had finally bested his greatest rival on the biggest stage. He looked stronger and more confident in his

44:35.900 --> 45:05.900
game than ever before. EVO 2015 represented a major turning point in HBox's career where he toppled one rival for another to take their place. From that day on, Hungrybox had his sights set on Armada.

45:05.900 --> 45:11.740
He was even far more closer to solving his Fox. He may have been totally stumped if it weren't for a little help from Captain Crunch.

45:17.180 --> 45:25.740
Crunch was a Fox player from Hungrybox's hometown of Orlando. After a disappointing finish at CEO 2015, their hometown tournament,

45:26.220 --> 45:34.660
HBox and Crunch started talking about how to deal with Puff's most difficult matchup. Soon after, Crunch assumed the role of Hungrybox's full-time coach and

45:34.980 --> 45:42.420
after losing to Armada at the Big House, HBox and Crunch made it their mission to analyze Armada's play style and find a way to beat him.

45:42.780 --> 45:50.020
For weeks, Hungrybox dedicated himself to study and grind the matchup so that the next time they met in bracket, he would be prepared.

46:04.660 --> 46:11.660
With his win against Armada, Hungrybox had proven that he could conquer anyone and everyone that Melee had to offer. He had spent a whole year building himself up as Melee's unstoppable villain, but after perhaps the most monumental win of his career so far, the pompous, arrogant HBox unexpectedly

46:34.660 --> 46:36.660
broke down in tears.

46:58.580 --> 47:02.820
There's an interview segment somewhere on YouTube featuring four of the five gods.

47:03.300 --> 47:07.900
Hungrybox was supposed to be there too, but due to a scheduling conflict, he couldn't participate.

47:08.500 --> 47:14.660
The producers decided to replace Hungrybox with a cardboard cutout of Hungrybox. An amusing prop,

47:14.660 --> 47:19.380
but also a disturbingly accurate metaphor of how many in the Smash community view him.

47:32.820 --> 47:45.220
It seems that Juan has always had a hard time fitting in, dating all the way back to his childhood when his family emigrated from Argentina to the United States.

47:45.900 --> 47:50.740
You have to imagine that it's not exactly easy to make a lot of friends at school when most of your

47:50.860 --> 47:55.740
classmates don't even speak the same language as you. Things at home weren't much better for him either.

47:56.060 --> 48:02.720
Juan's domestic life was often thrown into turmoil by his father, who would mismanage his family's wealth and outright abandon them

48:02.720 --> 48:05.000
in pursuit of his own fruitless business ventures.

48:05.280 --> 48:12.660
Juan's complex relationship with his father and the world around him ultimately created the competitor you see today, for better or for worse.

48:13.120 --> 48:21.400
The conflict Juan faced growing up instilled in him a powerful work ethic and unparalleled mental fortitude that he used to excel in melee and in life.

48:21.720 --> 48:26.940
All those losses over the years suddenly become a lot more reasonable when you realize that HBox was

48:27.020 --> 48:31.960
balancing melee with a full-time student workload, and then a full-time job as an engineer.

48:32.600 --> 48:40.260
Here's the amazing thing about going through school and working your ass off.

48:40.260 --> 48:44.620
You know how many times I did my own homework? I have more EVO wins than I did my homework.

48:44.720 --> 48:50.780
There's another video on YouTube that intercuts Hungrybox's graduation speech with Mango's high school stories.

48:51.140 --> 48:56.760
The juxtaposition here is fascinating. Unlike HBox, Mango never tried at school.

48:56.800 --> 49:00.840
He risked all of his life's prospects to become the best melee player in the world and

49:01.320 --> 49:07.580
ultimately succeeded. That part of Mango's personality represents the spirit of competitive melee as a whole,

49:08.000 --> 49:15.240
a community that was never supposed to succeed, never supposed to make it as far as they did, never supposed to outlast the other Smash games.

49:15.400 --> 49:22.160
And yet, against all odds, they did. Some melee fans like to imagine that Hungrybox would still be successful

49:22.160 --> 49:29.120
even if he never picked up a controller, that Hungrybox never needed melee, and that melee doesn't need Hungrybox.

49:30.000 --> 49:35.080
This game has been my escape for over a decade from whatever else life offers.

49:35.200 --> 49:39.720
And for everyone else, if that's the same for you, I love you, and thank you for coming!

49:40.280 --> 49:46.480
After moving to America, Hungrybox used melee as a way to fit in, as a way to make friends, and as a way to seek

49:46.480 --> 49:54.360
refuge from the turbulent environment around him. Hungrybox needed melee as much as anyone else. His passion for the game is undeniable.

49:54.800 --> 50:01.560
But soon enough, he would find that the very community from which he sought comfort and acceptance was beginning to reject him.

50:01.680 --> 50:05.680
Like everything else in his life, it only gave him a bigger chip on his shoulder.

50:06.560 --> 50:12.920
And they hurl insults at you, and they tell you, you know, all the worst things you could imagine with no

50:14.120 --> 50:21.520
respect or no care for what's going on in your personal life. No, they don't give a rat's ass about that.

50:21.520 --> 50:25.240
They just care that you play a really gay jigglypuff.

50:26.320 --> 50:28.320
And I came close.

50:28.680 --> 50:33.840
You know, came really close to just giving up, to quitting. I did.

50:36.000 --> 50:40.720
I'll play this game for 20 more years, if that's what it takes to be the best player in the world.

50:40.720 --> 50:47.320
Hungrybox ended 2015 ranked second behind Armada.

50:47.320 --> 50:53.320
Fueled by his newfound belief that he could beat anyone, Hungrybox entered 2016 on a warpath.

51:03.320 --> 51:07.960
The first half of the year was marked by Hungrybox and Armada swapping tournament wins.

51:08.280 --> 51:15.040
Both competitors were playing at the highest caliber of their entire careers, and they looked to be on a collision course heading into Evo.

51:18.680 --> 51:25.120
Evo 2016 would represent the absolute peak of Melee as a competitive game. The tournament drew more than

51:25.820 --> 51:29.200
2,300 entrants, a figure not matched before or since.

51:29.920 --> 51:35.960
For Hungrybox, his path was clear. Make it back to grand finals where, more likely than not,

51:36.440 --> 51:42.000
Armada would be there waiting for him. This time, however, Hungrybox would know how to beat him.

51:46.000 --> 51:48.240
Truly, it would be a battle for the ages.

52:05.960 --> 52:12.160
Whoa, all right! Hungrybox with a 2-0 victory over ChillahDude.

52:26.400 --> 52:32.520
Being down this much, even without time, is hard. Classic Hungrybox, my man's a top 8.

52:35.960 --> 52:39.960
But I really like him, so we count him.

52:40.960 --> 52:42.960
One is done, zero grabs this one.

52:42.960 --> 52:45.960
Yeah, yeah, no, whoa! Yeah, no jumps, no pounds!

52:45.960 --> 52:49.960
Hungrybox down the king, the winner's bracket, 1-0.

52:49.960 --> 52:56.960
He's putting these hitboxes right outside of where Hbox wants to be, this is the needle, he's trying to snipe his jumps, what's he gonna get?

52:56.960 --> 53:01.960
Hungrybox is dead! 2-0! And Plump advances in the winner's side!

53:02.960 --> 53:04.960
Hungrybox going down to the loser's bracket.

53:05.960 --> 53:06.960
Yo, the assassin needle!

53:07.960 --> 53:16.960
As the story goes, following his loss to Plump in winner's semifinals, Hungrybox was so discouraged that he almost checked out of the tournament entirely.

53:16.960 --> 53:24.960
All of a sudden, the memories of his past failures all came rushing back, along with the bleak realization that this year would be no different.

53:24.960 --> 53:30.960
Although he adorned the nickname of Clutch, he had never actually won a major tournament from the loser's bracket.

53:30.960 --> 53:34.960
For a brief moment in his mind, his fate was sealed.

53:34.960 --> 53:41.960
For all the progress he made and as far as he came, Hungrybox could not win on the biggest stage when it mattered the most.

53:41.960 --> 53:46.960
He likely would have been finished too, if it weren't for a little help from Captain Crunch.

53:46.960 --> 53:53.960
Sometime in the interval between matches, Crunch was able to calm Hbox down and refresh his mindset for the next match.

53:53.960 --> 53:58.960
Sometimes, before you can learn how to win, you have to learn how to lose.

53:58.960 --> 54:05.960
It was at this moment that Hungrybox truly became Clutch, because after all, there was still so much melee left to play.

54:28.960 --> 54:31.960
Clutch was able to make it to the final match.

54:31.960 --> 54:34.960
Clutch was able to make it to the final match.

54:34.960 --> 54:37.960
Clutch was able to make it to the final match.

54:37.960 --> 54:40.960
Clutch was able to make it to the final match.

54:40.960 --> 54:43.960
Clutch was able to make it to the final match.

54:43.960 --> 54:46.960
Clutch was able to make it to the final match.

54:46.960 --> 54:49.960
Clutch was able to make it to the final match.

54:49.960 --> 54:52.960
Clutch was able to make it to the final match.

54:52.960 --> 54:55.960
Clutch was able to make it to the final match.

54:55.960 --> 54:58.960
Clutch was able to make it to the final match.

54:58.960 --> 55:01.960
Clutch was able to make it to the final match.

55:01.960 --> 55:04.960
Clutch was able to make it to the final match.

55:04.960 --> 55:07.960
Clutch was able to make it to the final match.

55:07.960 --> 55:10.960
Clutch was able to make it to the final match.

55:10.960 --> 55:13.960
Clutch was able to make it to the final match.

55:13.960 --> 55:16.960
Clutch was able to make it to the final match.

55:16.960 --> 55:19.960
Clutch was able to make it to the final match.

55:19.960 --> 55:22.960
Clutch was able to make it to the final match.

55:22.960 --> 55:25.960
Clutch was able to make it to the final match.

55:25.960 --> 55:28.960
Clutch was able to make it to the final match.

55:28.960 --> 55:31.960
Clutch was able to make it to the final match.

55:31.960 --> 55:34.960
Clutch was able to make it to the final match.

55:34.960 --> 55:37.960
Clutch was able to make it to the final match.

55:37.960 --> 55:40.960
Clutch was able to make it to the final match.

55:40.960 --> 55:43.960
Clutch was able to make it to the final match.

55:43.960 --> 55:46.960
Clutch was able to make it to the final match.

55:46.960 --> 55:49.960
Clutch was able to make it to the final match.

55:49.960 --> 55:52.960
Clutch was able to make it to the final match.

55:52.960 --> 55:55.960
Clutch was able to make it to the final match.

55:55.960 --> 55:58.960
Clutch was able to make it to the final match.

55:58.960 --> 56:01.960
Clutch was able to make it to the final match.

56:01.960 --> 56:04.960
Clutch was able to make it to the final match.

56:04.960 --> 56:07.960
Clutch was able to make it to the final match.

56:07.960 --> 56:10.960
Clutch was able to make it to the final match.

56:10.960 --> 56:13.960
Clutch was able to make it to the final match.

56:13.960 --> 56:16.960
Clutch was able to make it to the final match.

56:16.960 --> 56:19.960
Clutch was able to make it to the final match.

56:19.960 --> 56:22.960
Clutch was able to make it to the final match.

56:22.960 --> 56:25.960
Clutch was able to make it to the final match.

56:25.960 --> 56:28.960
Clutch was able to make it to the final match.

56:28.960 --> 56:31.960
Clutch was able to make it to the final match.

56:31.960 --> 56:34.960
Clutch was able to make it to the final match.

56:34.960 --> 56:37.960
Clutch was able to make it to the final match.

56:37.960 --> 56:40.960
Clutch was able to make it to the final match.

56:40.960 --> 56:43.960
Clutch was able to make it to the final match.

56:43.960 --> 56:45.960
Clutch was able to make it to the final match.

56:45.960 --> 56:48.960
Clutch was able to make it to the final match.

56:48.960 --> 56:51.960
Clutch was able to make it to the final match.

56:51.960 --> 56:54.960
Clutch was able to make it to the final match.

56:54.960 --> 56:57.960
Clutch was able to make it to the final match.

56:57.960 --> 57:00.960
Clutch was able to make it to the final match.

57:00.960 --> 57:03.960
Clutch was able to make it to the final match.

57:03.960 --> 57:06.960
Clutch was able to make it to the final match.

57:06.960 --> 57:09.960
Clutch was able to make it to the final match.

57:09.960 --> 57:12.960
Clutch was able to make it to the final match.

57:12.960 --> 57:14.960
Clutch was able to make it to the final match.

57:14.960 --> 57:17.960
Clutch was able to make it to the final match.

57:17.960 --> 57:20.960
Clutch was able to make it to the final match.

57:20.960 --> 57:23.960
Clutch was able to make it to the final match.

57:23.960 --> 57:26.960
Clutch was able to make it to the final match.

57:26.960 --> 57:29.960
Clutch was able to make it to the final match.

57:29.960 --> 57:32.960
Clutch was able to make it to the final match.

57:32.960 --> 57:35.960
Clutch was able to make it to the final match.

57:35.960 --> 57:38.960
Clutch was able to make it to the final match.

57:38.960 --> 57:41.960
Clutch was able to make it to the final match.

57:41.960 --> 57:44.960
Clutch was able to make it to the final match.

58:11.960 --> 58:15.960
And then the moment that changed Melee forever.

58:41.960 --> 58:44.960
And then the moment that changed Melee forever.

59:12.960 --> 59:15.960
And then the moment that changed Melee forever.

59:35.960 --> 59:39.960
Sometimes the only thing you need to win is believing that you can.

59:39.960 --> 59:45.960
In Melee, the difference between winning and losing can often come down to just a few pixels and a few frames.

59:45.960 --> 59:50.960
But the difference between winners and losers feels far, far greater.

59:50.960 --> 59:54.960
For years, Hungrybox embodied the competitor who was never quite good enough.

59:54.960 --> 59:57.960
He was always so close, yet so far.

59:57.960 --> 01:00:03.960
EVO 2016 changed all of that, and Hungrybox walked out of that building a completely different player.

01:00:03.960 --> 01:00:08.960
After accomplishing what he did, nothing could stop him from becoming the best in the world.

01:00:08.960 --> 01:00:13.960
From that moment on, Hungrybox would never be the same, and neither would Melee.

01:00:18.960 --> 01:00:23.960
After conquering his greatest challenge yet, Hungrybox fell into a bit of a slump.

01:00:23.960 --> 01:00:27.960
After starting the year on fire, he would not win another tournament after EVO,

01:00:27.960 --> 01:00:31.960
finishing second in the rankings, once again trailing Armada.

01:00:31.960 --> 01:00:36.960
Following a disappointing loss of the Big House, he would take a moment to pause and re-evaluate his life.

01:00:37.960 --> 01:00:43.960
Perhaps guided by those discouraging words that haunted him for his entire career, he knew what he had to do.

01:00:43.960 --> 01:00:48.960
At the end of 2016, Hungrybox quit his job to play Melee full-time.

01:00:51.960 --> 01:00:55.960
At first, his newfound commitment to the game didn't seem to change much.

01:00:55.960 --> 01:01:00.960
It didn't help that it coincided with possibly the most dominant stretch of Armada's career.

01:01:00.960 --> 01:01:05.960
But then, late in the year, Hungrybox started winning, and then he kept on winning.

01:01:05.960 --> 01:01:11.960
If he could score a victory at the Big House, HBox could put himself in serious contention for the number one ranking.

01:01:11.960 --> 01:01:17.960
His rival Armada would fall to Plup, who was in the midst of an incredible winner's bracket run.

01:01:17.960 --> 01:01:23.960
Hungrybox would stumble early, then proceed to tear through the loser's bracket to meet Plup in Grand Finals.

01:01:23.960 --> 01:01:29.960
As the crowd rallied around the underdog Plup to complete his fairytale run, the glass slipper broke.

01:01:36.960 --> 01:01:42.960
There was no pop-up after Hungrybox double-eliminated Plup to capture his first Big House title.

01:01:42.960 --> 01:01:46.960
He just slowly turned his gaze towards the now lifeless crowd.

01:01:46.960 --> 01:01:53.960
A few people clapped. A couple cheered. Most had already begun filing for the exits without saying a word.

01:02:05.960 --> 01:02:08.960
I feel like I left part of me on that stage today.

01:02:08.960 --> 01:02:13.960
You ever have everything you ever wanted, and then when you finally have it, you're like, now what?

01:02:13.960 --> 01:02:19.960
One year ago, after the very same tournament, Hungrybox decided that he was ready to become Melee's best player.

01:02:19.960 --> 01:02:23.960
He never stopped to consider whether Melee was ready for him.

01:02:23.960 --> 01:02:25.960
Be careful what you wish for, Juan.

01:02:35.960 --> 01:03:03.960
And so we enter the era of HBox as the number one Melee player.

01:03:03.960 --> 01:03:07.960
An era characterized by two remarkable shifts in Melee.

01:03:07.960 --> 01:03:11.960
The first of which being the end of the five gods dominating the game.

01:03:11.960 --> 01:03:20.960
The untouchable status of the gods had been in decline ever since 2016, after PPMD was forced to take an indefinite leave of absence due to medical issues.

01:03:20.960 --> 01:03:24.960
To this day, he has still not returned to competitive play.

01:03:24.960 --> 01:03:32.960
The four remaining gods continued to hold the keys to the kingdom through 2017, but many were beginning to tell that the end was near.

01:03:32.960 --> 01:03:50.960
2018 saw the year's two biggest events fall to new contenders, with Plup taking Genesis and Leffen taking EVO.

01:03:50.960 --> 01:04:00.960
Midway through 2018, Armada seemed poised to retake the number one rank from Hungrybox, only to shock everyone by announcing a sudden retirement from Melee singles competition.

01:04:00.960 --> 01:04:08.960
Although never explicitly mentioned, many have attributed his retirement to the constant stress he suffered from trying to keep pace with Hungrybox.

01:04:08.960 --> 01:04:16.960
For me, I feel like if I can't have fun doing it, then there's no point in doing it.

01:04:16.960 --> 01:04:23.960
At around the same time, Mew2King started shifting his focus away from Melee in favor of streaming and writing his book.

01:04:23.960 --> 01:04:31.960
In 2019, Mew2King only competed in four events and looks unlikely to return to full-time competition anytime soon.

01:04:31.960 --> 01:04:37.960
Mango, perhaps the most dominant player ever in his prime, failed to win a tournament in 2018.

01:04:37.960 --> 01:04:48.960
And while he can still crank out the occasional epic performance, his inconsistency has relegated him to a shadow of his former glory, placing his god status in serious question.

01:04:48.960 --> 01:04:56.960
These days, it seems that Hungrybox is the only god left who can still strike fear into the hearts of his opponents through his sheer dominance alone.

01:04:56.960 --> 01:05:00.960
In his time, there were four others like him. Now, there's just one.

01:05:03.960 --> 01:05:10.960
The current state of Melee is represented partly by the decline of the gods, but mostly by something far more confounding.

01:05:10.960 --> 01:05:13.960
Hungrybox always wanted to become the best in the world.

01:05:13.960 --> 01:05:20.960
He struggled through years of frustration, gradually improving and eventually defeating the best players that Melee had to offer.

01:05:20.960 --> 01:05:26.960
But when he finally achieved his life's goal, he began to realize that the promised land didn't exactly come as promised.

01:05:26.960 --> 01:05:31.960
Becoming number one in the world was the hardest thing Hungrybox had done in his entire life.

01:05:31.960 --> 01:05:35.960
He was about to find out that being number one was even harder.

01:05:35.960 --> 01:05:40.960
It's common for sports or games to generally dislike their most dominant competitors.

01:05:40.960 --> 01:05:46.960
But in all these cases, most of the hatred never strays far from the confines of the competitive landscape.

01:05:46.960 --> 01:05:54.960
You hate Tom Brady when he destroys your favorite team in the playoffs, but if you saw him walking down the street, you'd probably want his autograph.

01:05:54.960 --> 01:05:59.960
In Melee, the hatred for Hungrybox has progressed far beyond a simple competitive rivalry.

01:05:59.960 --> 01:06:04.960
A large fraction of the Melee community seem to treat Hungrybox with utter contempt.

01:06:04.960 --> 01:06:11.960
A lot of this comes from the idea that, by simply being the number one player, Hungrybox is killing the game.

01:06:11.960 --> 01:06:19.960
Much of this rhetoric stems from players like Leffen, who has assumed the role of Hungrybox's arch-rival following Armada's retirement.

01:06:19.960 --> 01:06:26.960
Leffen is perhaps the biggest proponent of the Puff Doomsday Theory, a scenario I have unofficially labeled 20FF.

01:06:26.960 --> 01:06:38.960
Leffen believes that Jigglypuff is not only the strongest character, but the easiest to play.

01:06:38.960 --> 01:06:45.960
In the year 20FF, no one plays Fox anymore because everyone has switched to Puff in order to beat Hungrybox.

01:06:45.960 --> 01:06:53.960
Melee games have devolved into boring, unwatchable stall fests where the only measure of winning is determined by which Puff player can out-camp the other.

01:06:53.960 --> 01:07:01.960
A compelling theory until you realize that Hungrybox is the only Puff player in the top 35, and has been for basically the past decade.

01:07:01.960 --> 01:07:09.960
Even now, entering year 3 of Hungrybox as Melee's top player, Jigglypuff mains are still few and far between.

01:07:09.960 --> 01:07:21.960
If Puff was truly such an unskilled, overpowered character as many of its ardent critics like to claim, then surely someone, anyone else could have risen to the top of the Melee metagame besides HBox.

01:07:21.960 --> 01:07:32.960
20FF theorists will often counter this by saying that playing Puff is so boring that hardly anyone is willing to play as the character even if it could vastly improve their tournament results.

01:07:32.960 --> 01:07:40.960
They say this despite the great number of Ice Climbers players who only practice wobbling setups for the sole purpose of cheesing tournament wins.

01:07:40.960 --> 01:07:45.960
In a competitive game, it's no surprise that people will do anything to win.

01:07:45.960 --> 01:07:53.960
You play to win the game. Hello?

01:07:53.960 --> 01:08:02.960
And at some point, you have to account for the fact that Hungrybox is the only Puff player in the modern era who has been able to consistently win.

01:08:02.960 --> 01:08:09.960
That's the great thing about sports. You play to win. You don't play to just play it.

01:08:09.960 --> 01:08:18.960
The same critics also like to claim that Puff is as boring to watch as it is to play and that Melee is hemorrhaging viewers for as long as HBox is on top.

01:08:18.960 --> 01:08:26.960
Even though in 2019, during Hungrybox's most dominant stretch, peak viewership actually increased across most tournaments.

01:08:26.960 --> 01:08:33.960
This is consistent with many other spectator sports. By and large, audiences tune in to watch juggernauts.

01:08:33.960 --> 01:08:37.960
Michael Jordan was possibly the most dominant player in NBA history.

01:08:37.960 --> 01:08:44.960
As he led the Bulls to their sixth championship in eight seasons, the NBA set their all-time record for television viewership.

01:08:44.960 --> 01:08:48.960
The next season, after Jordan's retirement, ratings plummeted.

01:08:48.960 --> 01:08:55.960
The same pattern can be observed in golf, whose ratings are notoriously dependent on whether Tiger Woods is in contention.

01:08:55.960 --> 01:08:58.960
The trend even holds true in games you wouldn't expect.

01:08:58.960 --> 01:09:03.960
During James Holzhauer's 22-game Jeopardy! winning streak, ratings skyrocketed.

01:09:03.960 --> 01:09:10.960
Do you think the same number of people tuned in a month afterwards when the show returned to its regular, unremarkable contestants?

01:09:10.960 --> 01:09:17.960
When people watch stuff, they want stakes. They want to follow a story. They want antagonists to root against.

01:09:17.960 --> 01:09:22.960
Dominant players are inherently interesting because they fulfill all of these things.

01:09:22.960 --> 01:09:29.960
But that still doesn't stop a vocal portion of the community from zealously believing that Hungrybox is single-handedly killing Melee.

01:09:29.960 --> 01:09:36.960
I'm basically trying to say Hungrybox deserves more credit, and people discredit him because he's been winning for so long.

01:09:36.960 --> 01:09:42.960
Hungrybox victories are treated like funerals, while his defeats are celebrated like God's gift to the game.

01:09:42.960 --> 01:09:46.960
The goal of the game for many has devolved into stopping HBox.

01:09:46.960 --> 01:09:51.960
The Smash community as a whole has a tendency to rally hard against their top players.

01:09:51.960 --> 01:09:56.960
In Smash 4, the sequel gained a brawl. No one was better than Zero.

01:09:56.960 --> 01:10:03.960
At one point, he won 56 tournaments in a row, a record that will likely never be broken by any other Smash competitor.

01:10:03.960 --> 01:10:08.960
His staggering winning streak also spawned an insatiable desire to see him lose,

01:10:08.960 --> 01:10:12.960
and after three years of constant pressure and harassment from the Smash 4 community,

01:10:12.960 --> 01:10:17.960
Zero lost all passion for the game and retired from competition entirely.

01:10:17.960 --> 01:10:21.960
Even Armada at his peak faced a considerable amount of hate in Melee,

01:10:21.960 --> 01:10:25.960
despite being one of the most widely respected players of all time.

01:10:25.960 --> 01:10:29.960
Even though he also dominated with a pink, floaty, defensive character,

01:10:29.960 --> 01:10:33.960
not many people considered Armada to be a threat to the game itself.

01:10:33.960 --> 01:10:40.960
Nothing Armada faced ever came close to the amount of bitterness and vitriol that Hungrybox tolerates on a regular basis.

01:10:40.960 --> 01:10:48.960
His eternal reward for struggling and clawing to Melee's top rank is to be perhaps the most ostracized top player of any game ever played.

01:10:48.960 --> 01:10:54.960
At least perennially hated teams like the Patriots can return to their home crowd and be cheered.

01:10:54.960 --> 01:11:01.960
It doesn't matter where Hungrybox goes today. Nobody cheers him. He can never be applauded for his achievements.

01:11:01.960 --> 01:11:04.960
Many in the Melee community say he deserves the hate.

01:11:04.960 --> 01:11:12.960
In addition to the prevailing belief that he's ruining the game, many are quick to express their sheer disgust for HBox as a person.

01:11:12.960 --> 01:11:19.960
Some decry his unwillingness to play friendlies or mentor other players, as he tends to guard his Jigglypuff gameplay as a trade secret.

01:11:19.960 --> 01:11:25.960
Others cite instances of his infidelity in past relationships as an indictment against his morals.

01:11:25.960 --> 01:11:31.960
Most just accuse Hungrybox of being generally rude or egotistical based on interactions from years ago.

01:11:31.960 --> 01:11:36.960
There's a saying in the Melee community that everyone has an HBox story, me included.

01:11:36.960 --> 01:11:42.960
I mean this one time I saw Hungrybox at a grocery store in Gainesville, but I won't get into that here.

01:11:42.960 --> 01:11:49.960
The point is that Melee players can usually pull out a laundry list of reasons for why they detest HBox on a personal level.

01:11:49.960 --> 01:11:53.960
And for that reason, he gets scrutinized more than any other player in the game.

01:11:53.960 --> 01:11:58.960
Athletes like Michael Jordan and Tiger Woods each had their own share of personal demons.

01:11:58.960 --> 01:12:04.960
But their respective audiences were both able to look past that and appreciate their accomplishments as competitors.

01:12:04.960 --> 01:12:10.960
It seems that the Melee community has an all too difficult time applying the same treatment to Hungrybox.

01:12:10.960 --> 01:12:16.960
They like to assume that everything HBox does has some nefarious self-serving plan behind it.

01:12:16.960 --> 01:12:22.960
It got bad enough to where Hungrybox couldn't even look at his watch on stage without facing backlash and drama.

01:12:22.960 --> 01:12:32.960
It's as if Melee people have such a low opinion of HBox that they couldn't give him the benefit of the doubt that he may have been running late for a flight and wanted to keep track of the time.

01:12:32.960 --> 01:12:36.960
It doesn't matter how much he reforms his actions and attitude today.

01:12:36.960 --> 01:12:42.960
Hungrybox has always been held to his lowest standard and he's never allowed to overcome his past reputation.

01:12:43.960 --> 01:12:55.960
Perhaps the community's apparent zero tolerance policy for rudeness and ego would make a little more sense if they also applied it to Leffen, who publicly disrespects other players, games, and communities on a weekly basis.

01:12:55.960 --> 01:13:01.960
But alas, Leffen, like every other player, gets cheered wildly over Hungrybox.

01:13:01.960 --> 01:13:10.960
After a while, the whole list of grievances against Juan Hungrybox de Biedma reads like sour grapes, double standards, and empty excuses.

01:13:10.960 --> 01:13:15.960
At the end of the day, the Melee community stigmatizes HBox for the same reason they always have.

01:13:15.960 --> 01:13:18.960
He doesn't fit into their idea of what Melee should be.

01:13:18.960 --> 01:13:24.960
The mere existence of Hungrybox challenges the fundamental identity of the game itself.

01:13:24.960 --> 01:13:30.960
Melee prides itself on its fast-paced gameplay, yet its top player uses one of the slowest characters.

01:13:30.960 --> 01:13:38.960
Melee celebrates its highly skilled technical mechanics, yet its top player uses the character with the most simplistic controls.

01:13:38.960 --> 01:13:46.960
Melee relies on its risky and aggressive play styles to wow its spectators, yet its top player plays patiently and defensively.

01:13:46.960 --> 01:13:51.960
Hungrybox can never be truly respected because Hungrybox isn't Melee.

01:13:51.960 --> 01:13:54.960
But allow me to explain to you how he is.

01:13:58.960 --> 01:14:00.960
It's July 9th, 2013.

01:14:00.960 --> 01:14:08.960
After raising more than $90,000 for charity, the Melee community punched a ticket for their beloved franchise to return to EVO.

01:14:08.960 --> 01:14:14.960
After six long years of waiting, the biggest Melee tournament in history was less than a week away.

01:14:14.960 --> 01:14:16.960
This could be Melee's big break.

01:14:16.960 --> 01:14:23.960
If the talent can put on a good enough show, Melee may finally be recognized for the brilliant competitive masterpiece it is.

01:14:23.960 --> 01:14:31.960
With less than three days to go before the tournament, Nintendo blocked EVO from streaming Melee to the absolute shock of the Smash community.

01:14:31.960 --> 01:14:37.960
Eventually, after a sizable amount of backlash, Nintendo allowed the event to proceed as normal.

01:14:37.960 --> 01:14:40.960
But the message had been delivered loud and clear.

01:14:40.960 --> 01:14:44.960
Nintendo would never truly respect Smash as a competitive game.

01:14:44.960 --> 01:14:49.960
No matter how popular competitive Melee got, the community would always be on their own.

01:14:49.960 --> 01:14:53.960
It didn't really make much of a difference because that's how it had always been.

01:14:53.960 --> 01:15:03.960
But in an age where most game developers embrace competitive play by bankrolling huge tournament pots, it's discouraging to realize that Melee will never have that privilege.

01:15:03.960 --> 01:15:08.960
2019 saw a Fortnite player earn $3 million by winning a single tournament.

01:15:08.960 --> 01:15:13.960
That's nearly ten times the prize money that Hungrybox has won in his entire career.

01:15:13.960 --> 01:15:20.960
A career in which he consistently placed top five at more than a dozen tournaments per year for over a decade.

01:15:20.960 --> 01:15:29.960
It's sad to think that top Melee players who are so talented and draw in so many viewers often have a hard time affording rent from tournament winnings alone.

01:15:29.960 --> 01:15:34.960
Melee fans love Mango because Mango represents how they see Melee.

01:15:34.960 --> 01:15:39.960
What many of them don't consider is that Hungrybox represents how the rest of the world sees Melee.

01:15:39.960 --> 01:15:46.960
Other Smash players often regard Melee players as rude and arrogant, and they actively root against Melee success.

01:15:46.960 --> 01:15:51.960
Casual players are often hostile to the idea that Smash is even played competitively at all.

01:15:51.960 --> 01:15:57.960
Much of the Smash fandom can't even comprehend the reasoning behind turning off items in tournament play.

01:15:57.960 --> 01:16:06.960
When Melee was removed from the evil lineup in 2019, many people celebrated, saying that Melee no longer deserved the spotlight.

01:16:06.960 --> 01:16:11.960
Lots of people in the general fighting game community believe that Melee never deserved the spotlight it got.

01:16:11.960 --> 01:16:19.960
The Smash Bros franchise and Nintendo games in general have been stigmatized as kids games ever since they censored blood in Mortal Kombat.

01:16:19.960 --> 01:16:24.960
Many traditional fighting game players don't respect competitive Smash for this very reason.

01:16:24.960 --> 01:16:28.960
They can't take a game seriously if it was never intended for serious play.

01:16:28.960 --> 01:16:38.960
Because Smash is a kid-friendly, casual-friendly game, the FGC likes to assume that it's easy and claim that competitive Smash players don't have the skill to lace their boots.

01:16:38.960 --> 01:16:50.960
As long as Smash players don't have to memorize button combinations with quarter circles, that must mean that their controls are crude and basic and that you don't need to put in any real effort to win a Smash tournament.

01:16:50.960 --> 01:16:55.960
All this sound familiar? Well, that's because Melee sees Hungrybox how the rest of Smash sees Melee.

01:16:55.960 --> 01:16:59.960
The fighting game community treats Smash how Melee treats Hungrybox.

01:16:59.960 --> 01:17:04.960
You may not want to believe it, but Hungrybox is Melee in the most literal sense.

01:17:04.960 --> 01:17:10.960
Both spent years being told they weren't good enough, that they would never achieve what they would eventually become.

01:17:10.960 --> 01:17:17.960
Both were constantly disrespected, stigmatized, and ridiculed because they didn't quite fit into what others thought they should be.

01:17:17.960 --> 01:17:21.960
Both were able to succeed even though everyone else wanted them to fail.

01:17:21.960 --> 01:17:32.960
Both have a huge chip on their shoulder because no matter what they accomplish, how many challenges they overcome, and how much they prove themselves, they will never get the respect they deserve.

01:17:32.960 --> 01:17:42.960
In the countless, endless online arguments between the FGC and Smash, Melee fans will always defend their game by saying just because it's different doesn't mean it's easy.

01:17:42.960 --> 01:17:46.960
Every time this happens, Hungrybox just shakes his head and sighs.

01:17:47.960 --> 01:17:57.960
It's hard for everyone. It's a lot easier for Puff or Falco or Fox. It's all hard to win in front of us. So, just get better.

01:18:00.960 --> 01:18:07.960
Hungrybox is Melee. And you know what else? Hungrybox is the best in the world.

01:18:07.960 --> 01:18:12.960
And as much as some people would tell you otherwise, Melee has never been more interesting.

01:18:12.960 --> 01:18:16.960
2019 saw Hungrybox win 12 of the 20 tournaments he entered.

01:18:16.960 --> 01:18:22.960
It also saw a Pikachu main and a Captain Falcon main win majors for the first time in the history of the game.

01:18:22.960 --> 01:18:28.960
So despite Melee entering its 20th year of competitive play, it appears to be far from a solved game.

01:18:28.960 --> 01:18:34.960
And that's because despite how many people bought into 20XX, Jigglypuff is the meta.

01:18:34.960 --> 01:18:43.960
While the rise of Fox encouraged many players to get increasingly faster and more aggressive, the rise of Hungrybox has forced many of them back to the drawing board.

01:18:43.960 --> 01:18:51.960
Even though the new era has been tough on Foxes, it has led to the rise of a new generation of players with more patient, strategic playstyles.

01:18:51.960 --> 01:18:58.960
Players like Zane, Wizzrobe, and Amsa have all demonstrated the capacity to beat Hungrybox without a favorable character matchup.

01:18:58.960 --> 01:19:07.960
At times, despite his recent dominance, Hungrybox has never looked more vulnerable, frequently losing to players and characters that he never has before.

01:19:07.960 --> 01:19:14.960
This is mostly due to how, at long last, the rest of Melee's competition is finally catching up to the level of the gods.

01:19:14.960 --> 01:19:21.960
In present-day Melee, the gods are the old generation and Hungrybox is the last of the gods.

01:19:21.960 --> 01:19:27.960
Melee is approaching the precipice of an entirely new era and Hungrybox remains the last stickler of the old days.

01:19:27.960 --> 01:19:31.960
In a way, Hungrybox carries the torch of all the gods.

01:19:31.960 --> 01:19:36.960
Newer players will never know the satisfaction of challenging a prime Mango, Armada, or PPMD.

01:19:36.960 --> 01:19:40.960
For them, facing Hungrybox is the next best thing.

01:19:40.960 --> 01:19:50.960
He represents one of the few remaining links between old and new Melee, and as much as some Melee fans would like to forget, he's an integral part of the game's history and legacy.

01:19:50.960 --> 01:19:55.960
Hungrybox, like Melee, is still going strong all these years later.

01:19:55.960 --> 01:20:01.960
In 2018, Nintendo released the fifth installment to the Smash franchise with Super Smash Bros. Ultimate.

01:20:01.960 --> 01:20:12.960
So far, it has been the first Smash title to successfully appeal to both sides of the competitive community, with players like Armada, Leffen, and even Hungrybox frequenting Ultimate events.

01:20:12.960 --> 01:20:18.960
However, despite the popularity of Ultimate, Melee still consistently surpasses it in viewership.

01:20:18.960 --> 01:20:24.960
Even in its advanced age, Melee is the future and shows no signs of dying off anytime soon.

01:20:24.960 --> 01:20:32.960
There will come a day when Hungrybox stops playing Melee, and in his absence, the game will become that much less interesting as a result.

01:20:32.960 --> 01:20:40.960
And now, at long last, we return to the crab, perhaps the most enduring symbol of Melee's relationship with Hungrybox.

01:20:40.960 --> 01:20:46.960
Crab mentality refers to the unwillingness of a community to let its individuals succeed.

01:20:46.960 --> 01:20:55.960
It's based on the behavior of crabs in a bucket, who will often prevent their peers from escaping by pulling them back from the brink of freedom, thus dooming them all.

01:20:55.960 --> 01:21:01.960
If Melee is to survive in the future, they'll have to learn to tolerate their top player.

01:21:01.960 --> 01:21:05.960
By trying to destroy HBox, they're only destroying themselves.

01:21:05.960 --> 01:21:09.960
Because at the end of the day, Hungrybox is Juan de Biedma.

01:21:09.960 --> 01:21:14.960
Despite playing for the past decade with the status of God, he's only human.

01:21:14.960 --> 01:21:18.960
It is my personal belief that human beings are naturally meant to persevere.

01:21:18.960 --> 01:21:28.960
No matter what happens, as long as we simply make the decision not to give up, it simply does get better if you believe it will.

01:21:28.960 --> 01:21:39.960
There's certain experiences that even thinking about, even the act of thinking about it sets you back, maybe all the way back to all the work you've done just by thinking about it.

01:21:39.960 --> 01:21:41.960
But that's not the point.

01:21:41.960 --> 01:21:44.960
The point is, you need to focus on the fact that you overcame it.

01:21:44.960 --> 01:21:48.960
And if you're going through it, focus on the fact that you are choosing to overcome it.

01:21:48.960 --> 01:21:53.960
You're pushing through, and that's more than anyone can ask of you.

01:21:54.960 --> 01:21:56.960
Will HBox ever overcome the hate?

01:21:56.960 --> 01:22:05.960
That remains to be seen, but until that happens, he will always have a reason to keep fighting, to overcome perhaps his greatest challenge yet.

01:22:05.960 --> 01:22:10.960
And if there's one thing the Melee community has learned over the years, it's to never count out Hungrybox.

01:22:10.960 --> 01:22:15.960
The one player in Melee who spent his entire career doing stuff that couldn't be done.

01:22:15.960 --> 01:22:20.960
I said I'll be top 5 jigs in Florida, I'll be best jigs in Florida, I'll be top 3 in Florida, I'll be the best player in Florida.

01:22:20.960 --> 01:22:25.960
One day I'll be the best player on the East Coast, and maybe, who knows, one day I'll be the best player in the world.

01:22:25.960 --> 01:22:28.960
Just how did Hungrybox get so good?

01:22:28.960 --> 01:22:34.960
The truth is that Hungrybox became the best in the world not because he learned how to win, but because he learned how to lose.

01:22:35.960 --> 01:22:46.960
So yeah, he may get upset by Unranked Albert or 4-stock by Zayne or 6-0'd by Leffen, but after every defeat, you can count on HBox to pick up the pieces, come back later, and win.

01:22:46.960 --> 01:22:54.960
Hopefully one day Melee will learn to appreciate Hungrybox while they still can, because there will never ever be another player like him.

01:22:54.960 --> 01:23:04.960
Hungrybox! Hungrybox! Hungrybox! Hungrybox! Hungrybox! Hungrybox!
