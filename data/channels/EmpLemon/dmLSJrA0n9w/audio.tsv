0	2300	It's April 21st, 2019.
2300	7600	Competitors and spectators have gathered in Laurel, Maryland for the Pound 2019 tournament.
7600	13300	Today we visit the meeting of two players competing under the aliases of Mango and Hungrybox.
13300	20100	They're playing Super Smash Brothers Melee, a video game released in 2001 for the Nintendo GameCube.
20100	25200	Despite the age of the game, this event has managed to attract a live audience of a few hundred spectators
25200	29100	and upwards of 70,000 viewers tuning in from around the world.
29100	31400	Today is Championship Sunday.
31400	37900	After battling past the rest of the competition, the top 12 players are competing for the title of this year's Pound Champion.
37900	64400	Since this is a double elimination tournament, Hungrybox is kicked down to the losers bracket where he now has to face S2J.
64500	68200	The loser of this set will be out of the tournament in fifth place.
81900	86200	Hungrybox wins and advances to face Zane in the loser semi-finals.
86200	90900	Quickly, Hungrybox finds himself in deep trouble about to fall to an 0-2 deficit.
90900	94200	With his back against the wall, he rebounds to win Game 2.
94200	98200	He narrowly wins the next two games to eliminate Zane at fourth.
121700	125700	Once again, Hungrybox wins, eliminating Plup at third.
125700	131200	After defeating everyone in the losers bracket, Hungrybox has only one competitor left to face.
131200	134700	Mango, the player who sent him down there in the first place.
150900	153900	Mango, the player who sent him down there in the first place.
180900	197900	In their second encounter of the tournament, Hungrybox defeats Mango three games to one to reset the bracket.
197900	204900	Since it's a double elimination tournament, Hungrybox must defeat Mango for a second time to win the tournament.
210900	213900	Mango, the player who sent him down there in the first place.
240900	254900	And there it is! Hungrybox is your pound 2019 Smash Bros. Melee champion.
254900	259900	After an incredible comeback victory, Hungrybox begins to celebrate in front of the stunned crowd.
259900	265900	But unfortunately for him, the celebration he earned is about to be cut very, very short.
265900	269900	Hungrybox is the champion once again.
269900	288900	Just ten seconds after his victory, a disgruntled spectator throws a raw crab at Hungrybox, narrowly missing his head.
288900	295900	In a matter of seconds, Hungrybox is transformed from the most joyful person in the arena to the most miserable.
295900	299900	Most people don't care that much about video games, but some people do.
299900	303900	Out of these people, most don't care about competitive gaming, but some do.
303900	311900	And for all the esports out there, most spectators don't care about watching a 19-year-old game, but still, some do.
311900	319900	And out of those few people, surely no one cares enough about the outcome of a match to throw a raw crab at the winner.
319900	323900	But on this day in Laurel, Maryland, someone did.
323900	331900	As far as I know, this is the only time something like this has ever happened in the history of competitive video games.
331900	336900	But if it was gonna happen, it was probably gonna happen to Hungrybox.
336900	338900	Who is Hungrybox?
353900	365900	Before we can talk about Hungrybox, we have to talk about the game that made his name.
365900	374900	Super Smash Bros. is one of Nintendo's flagship franchises, releasing on every console dating back to its debut on the Nintendo 64.
374900	383900	The game was originally conceived by developer Masahiro Sakurai, who was interested in creating a four-player fighting game with Nintendo's most iconic characters.
383900	393900	Despite his vision, Sakurai prepared to field the game with generic fighters, as he never anticipated that Nintendo would approve of their flagship characters in such uncharted territory.
393900	403900	However, much to his surprise, Nintendo greenlit the most ambitious crossover event in history, and Super Smash Bros. was born from the defiance of expectations.
404900	411900	Super Smash Bros.
411900	416900	The game released in 1999 to a warm reception from critics and audiences alike.
416900	424900	While the novelty of barbarically pummeling beloved childhood mascots drew people into Smash, the game's unique mechanics kept them playing.
424900	430900	When first conceiving of the game, Sakurai wanted Smash to stand out from the typical 2D fighters of the era.
430900	434900	And he accomplished this with the game's fundamental objective.
434900	442900	In standard fighting games, players damage each other to deplete a health bar, and you win the game by lowering your opponent's health to zero.
442900	451900	Super Smash Bros. alters this formula by instead programming damage to increase knockback and setting the win condition to launching your opponent off-screen.
453900	459900	This relatively simple change produced radically different gameplay from other fighting games.
459900	472900	Instead of prioritizing complex button combinations and precise spacing, Smash places much more emphasis on movement, platforming, and stage positioning, mechanics that were rarely considered in other fighting games at the time.
472900	485900	While developing Smash, Sakurai wanted to offer the player a new experience with each session, and in doing so, created a game with incredibly divergent outcomes, resulting in dynamic, unpredictable gameplay.
485900	489900	But most importantly, a game that's very hard to figure out.
489900	493900	This design philosophy would serve as the blueprint for the series going forward.
493900	501900	And while Smash 64 brought a lot of ideas to the table, the concept wouldn't realize its full potential until its successor, Melee.
516900	523900	It seems as if Super Smash Bros. Melee has always been in a race against time, going all the way back to its development.
523900	537900	After the success of Smash 64, Sakurai was tasked with developing its sequel in time for the debut of Nintendo's new console, the GameCube, giving the team at HAL Laboratory just 13 months to complete its most daunting project yet.
537900	543900	After an exhaustive development cycle, the result was an accidental masterpiece.
543900	549900	Compared to its predecessor, Melee was much faster. Faster movement, faster attacks, faster combos.
549900	554900	The rapid pace of the game contributed to incredibly dynamic and unpredictable combat.
554900	558900	Melee offers the player an immense degree of control over their character.
558900	563900	Mechanically speaking, Sakurai described Melee as the sharpest in the series.
563900	567900	Players seemed to agree, as upon release, Melee was a smash hit.
567900	573900	However, despite the game's tight presentation, Melee would go on to be defined by its loose ends.
573900	577900	The game's hasty development allowed a few oversights to slip through the cracks.
577900	583900	In due time, players would begin to discover numerous exploits to gain a competitive edge over their opponents.
583900	591900	Combined with Melee's already fast gameplay, these techniques were able to transform an already good game into a masterpiece.
597900	609900	Super Smash Bros. Melee was, without a doubt, a very successful casual game,
609900	614900	but its unique mechanics set the foundation for one of the greatest competitive games of all time.
614900	620900	The discovery of such advanced tactics would push the game's potential beyond what anyone thought was possible.
620900	625900	Shortly after the game's release, local Melee tournaments began to spring up everywhere,
625900	630900	and thousands of players began contending for the title of the best Melee player in the world.
630900	635900	Starting in 2004, Major League Gaming would sponsor Melee on its Pro Circuit,
635900	640900	incentivizing the highest level of competition with thousands of dollars in prize money.
640900	644900	As tournaments became more prestigious, so too did the players.
644900	648900	Captain Jack, Isaiah, and Azen emerged as Melee's top contenders,
648900	654900	but no early player was better than Ken, the undisputed king of Smash.
654900	661900	From 2003 to 2005, he won almost every tournament he entered, beating Melee's best competition along the way.
661900	667900	Around 2006, new challengers like PC Chris and Korean DJ began closing the gap.
667900	673900	Ken retained his crown all the way through 2007, where Melee made its first appearance at EVO.
673900	676900	After battling through Melee's biggest tournament yet,
676900	681900	Ken would once again emerge victorious in what many at the time considered to be Melee's last hurrah.
685900	692900	In competitive video games, it's customary for players to compete in the latest version of their franchise.
692900	699900	After seven years as the GameCube's most popular title, Melee was scheduled to be supplanted by the next Smash game.
702900	707900	As the franchise moved to the Wii, the competitive Melee scene was expected to follow.
707900	711900	However, following one of the most anticipated releases in video game history,
711900	715900	Super Smash Bros. Brawl was not at all what people expected.
718900	724900	The combat was slow and plodding. Lower hitstun severely limited the potential of comboing.
724900	729900	Advanced tactics like wave dashing were replaced with punishing mechanics like tripping,
729900	732900	where the game would randomly stun players for dashing.
732900	738900	Oh, wow. Wow. And you hate to see that kind of thing happen. Oh, you stupid son of a...
739900	740900	What?
740900	746900	Needless to say, the sluggish pace of Brawl was a drastic change from the fast-paced precision of Melee.
746900	752900	Supposedly, Sakurai felt that Melee's highly technical execution made the game too difficult for casual play,
752900	757900	and he worked to make the sequel much more simple and accessible for new players.
757900	761900	While Brawl succeeded as a casual game, it suffered competitively.
761900	764900	Many of Melee's top players tried to give Brawl a chance.
764900	770900	One year after his final Melee victory, Ken would return to the finals of EVO playing Brawl,
770900	774900	where he would be promptly beaten by a 14-year-old kid.
774900	777900	The player who beat him had no prior tournament experience,
777900	782900	and he only entered because his family just happened to be vacationing near the venue at the time.
782900	787900	The tournament result was viewed as a total farce by the competitive Smash community.
787900	792900	The fact that essentially a random player could score a fluke win against a skilled veteran like Ken
792900	796900	served as an indictment against Brawl as a competitive game.
796900	802900	With all this considered, it didn't take long before many of Melee's competitors soured on the new Smash game.
802900	807900	For the first time ever, the Smash community was divided over the future of the franchise.
807900	811900	In an era before esports were commonplace in online culture,
811900	817900	many fans struggled to accept Smash Bros. as anything beyond its original role as a party game.
817900	823900	Most were prepared to write off Melee as a stale, dead game with nothing left to figure out,
823900	827900	and the vast majority of players were ready to move on with the series.
827900	833900	Only a small, ragtag community would stay behind in what they considered to be the better game.
833900	838900	And luckily for them, this 7-year-old title was still very much alive.
841900	848900	Right now we are in the Atlanta airport, and it's like 7, 3rd in the morning.
848900	852900	It's cold. I'm wearing a jacket, so it's not Florida.
859900	864900	Hungrybox started entering local Melee tournaments in the summer of 2007.
864900	869900	In just a few months, he started regularly placing in the top 5.
869900	872900	And by the next year, he started winning.
872900	877900	As HBox kept playing, he found himself conquering tougher and tougher competition.
877900	883900	In 2009, he entered Revival of Melee, the game's first major tournament since the release of Brawl.
883900	888900	Facing off against the best in the nation, Hungrybox placed 7th.
888900	891900	Four months later at Genesis, he placed 3rd.
891900	895900	Two months after that at Tipton 5, he won.
895900	901900	Just two years after he started competing, Hungrybox was already contending for the title of Best in the World.
901900	908900	But in addition to his individual success, HBox was arguably taking part in something much more important.
908900	913900	The rise of Hungrybox was indicative of a new generation of Melee.
913900	917900	By 2010, the old legends of yesteryear had pretty much vanished.
917900	921900	Like most of the old community, they had moved on to new frontiers.
921900	927900	The departure of Melee's old generation left new top players the opportunity to usher in a new era.
927900	936900	In January 2010, the Pound 4 tournament would mark the beginning of a period in Melee's history known as the Era of the Five Gods.
936900	940900	Specifically serving as the first tournament with all five gods in attendance.
940900	945900	The story of Melee's gods begins with the first god, Mewtwo King.
945900	950900	Beginning in 2005, Mewtwo King would eventually rise and defeat Melee's old legends.
950900	956900	Mewtwo King's Melee ascent was due almost entirely to his pioneering research into the game's combat.
956900	967900	Frame data, character matchups, KO percentages, information that's readily accessible today was originally discovered by Mewtwo King's exhaustive exploration of Melee's mechanics.
967900	972900	And for many years, no player knew more about the game than Mewtwo King.
972900	977900	In 2008, Mewtwo King was widely regarded as the top player in both Melee and Brawl.
978900	984900	To this day, he remains the only player to achieve the concurrent title of Best in the World in two different Smash games.
984900	991900	And as impressive as this accomplishment was, it meant that Mewtwo King's attention was divided among two very different games.
991900	994900	Leaving the door open for many to challenge his throne.
994900	1002900	The second of Melee's gods to rise to power would be Mango, who, by 2009, would overtake Mewtwo King as the top Melee player.
1002900	1009900	Throughout the history of Melee, many would argue that no player had a more intuitive understanding of the game than Mango.
1009900	1014900	Watching Mango perform at his highest level is an experience unlike anything else in Melee.
1014900	1021900	The way he could effortlessly string together complex combos led to a style that was as fluid as it was unstoppable.
1021900	1026900	At times, the only thing that could stop him was how much he was willing to try.
1026900	1030900	Mango's exciting and aggressive playstyle made him a consummate fan favorite.
1030900	1035900	Especially through his iconic clashes with Melee's third god, Armada.
1035900	1043900	As Europe's best player, Armada carried the weight of a whole continent on his shoulders as he traveled to prove himself in the United States.
1043900	1049900	Historically, Melee's competitive scene has viewed Europe as a significantly weaker region than North America.
1049900	1054900	A stigma that was often used by Americans to invalidate the success of European players.
1054900	1060900	Armada would defy everyone's expectations by immediately contending with America's best.
1060900	1066900	His unrivaled dedication and consistency would make him one of the most formidable opponents Melee had ever seen.
1066900	1072900	Hungrybox established himself as Melee's fourth god through his meteoric rise in 2009.
1072900	1079900	And last but not least, Melee's new generation would be cemented through the rise of the fifth god, Dr. PeePee.
1079900	1085900	Although he was the last to develop, PeePeeMD would quickly rise to the highest level of competition.
1085900	1091900	PeePee's style relied on tactical execution to pick apart his opponents with surgical precision.
1091900	1096900	When the doctor was in, you were about to be prescribed your daily dose of destruction.
1098900	1105900	These are Melee's five gods. Now that we've introduced who they are, we can talk about what they are.
1105900	1111900	Carrying the title of god in any game entails a great deal of prestige, and Smash Bros is no exception.
1111900	1115900	So what exactly did these five players do to transcend us lowly mortals?
1115900	1121900	It's unknown who exactly introduced the term five gods to describe Melee's top players,
1121900	1125900	but the expression started seeing frequent use in the summer of 2014,
1125900	1129900	most likely used to describe the era of supreme dominance that preceded it.
1129900	1135900	From 2009 to 2015, a member of the five gods would win every major tournament,
1135900	1139900	utterly dismantling the rest of the competition in the process.
1139900	1146900	In any competitive sport or game, it's typical to have one or two elite players win a lion's share of the competitions.
1146900	1151900	Chess, for example, has witnessed Magnus Carlsen dominate the competition for the past six years.
1151900	1158900	A rarer case is currently on display in tennis, which has seen three players dominate major tournaments over the past decade.
1158900	1164900	A competitive game with five elite players occupying the same era is almost unheard of,
1164900	1171900	but if such an unlikely event were to occur, it's somewhat fitting that it would happen in a game used to defying expectations.
1171900	1176900	As the legend goes, Melee's five gods would hardly ever lose to any other players,
1176900	1180900	and all were capable of defeating each other in any given competition,
1180900	1183900	but just how much better were the gods than everyone else?
1183900	1188900	Well, as a reminder, I like to recall two cases involving the player Hax,
1188900	1192900	a skilled competitor known for his flashy combos and lightning-quick execution.
1192900	1198900	In 2013, Hax was ranked as the number six player in the world, the best of the non-gods.
1198900	1203900	He would remain a perennial top ten player until his hiatus in 2015.
1203900	1207900	In a 2014 tournament, Hax faced off in a set against PPMD.
1207900	1211900	In the first game, he got three-stocked in about two and a half minutes.
1213900	1224900	In the second game, he got four-stocked in 68 seconds.
1234900	1239900	Later that year, Hax would compete in a set against Mango, which Mango would win three games to one.
1239900	1245900	Not the most impressive result, until you realize that Mango doesn't actually main Marth or Captain Falcon.
1245900	1248900	That's just the difference between a good player and a god.
1248900	1252900	Even when you're good, you're a long way from the best.
1258900	1264900	At one point, the gods were so far above the rest of the competition that they could even win with their secondary characters.
1264900	1268900	Now would probably be a good time to talk about Melee's characters.
1268900	1273900	Out of all the Smash games, Melee may have the most interesting character composition.
1273900	1277900	Some Smash games have one or two characters that outright dominate the meta,
1277900	1281900	with the most obvious example being Brawl's aptly named Meta Knight,
1281900	1286900	a character so blatantly overpowered that some tournaments chose to ban him entirely.
1286900	1290900	On the other hand, the best Melee character has always been kind of tough to figure out.
1290900	1296900	To put it simply, about a third of Melee's roster are completely unusable in a competitive setting.
1296900	1301900	Another third are just kind of bad, and the last third are all capable of winning tournaments.
1301900	1307900	To this day, the community remains largely undecided on which character is actually the best,
1307900	1312900	a debate that can be traced all the way back to the beginning of the game through the history of Melee's tier lists.
1312900	1321900	That's right, this widespread facet of modern internet discourse originated from the niche purpose of categorizing characters in fighting games.
1321900	1327900	In the early days of Melee, Sheik was considered the best character with her rapid attacks and movement.
1327900	1333900	As the meta progressed through the rest of the 2000s, more characters would emerge as top-tier contenders.
1333900	1338900	Peach with her strong aerial attacks, Marth with his chain grabs and huge spacing,
1338900	1343900	Captain Falcon with his heavy combos, the Ice Climbers with their infinite combo,
1343900	1347900	and the space animals Fox and Falco with their great mobility and high damage.
1347900	1349900	And then there's Puff.
1351900	1360900	In any competitive video game, your character is far more important than just a colorful avatar.
1360900	1365900	It's an extension of the self and an integral part of a player's identity.
1365900	1371900	In Melee, perhaps no player is more intertwined with a character than Hungrybox and his Jigglypuff.
1371900	1375900	Jigglypuff is the most confounding character in all of Melee.
1375900	1379900	She arguably should have never existed as a Smash character at all.
1379900	1383900	Puff is not even among the most popular characters in her own franchise,
1383900	1388900	but she wound up in Smash anyway because of her similar character design to Kirby.
1388900	1395900	The Smash 64 developers would recycle Kirby's character model and animations to fill out the game's 12th and final character slot.
1395900	1401900	And thus, the balloon Pokemon would remain as a mainstay for the rest of the franchise.
1401900	1405900	At a glance, Jigglypuff in Melee seems like a rather mediocre character.
1405900	1410900	She has five jumps and great mobility, but her ground game leaves much to be desired.
1410900	1414900	Most of her attacks do unimpressive damage and have a short range.
1414900	1419900	Combined with the slowest dash speed in the game, Puff has a hard time approaching other characters.
1419900	1423900	Two of her special attacks are practically useless in a competitive setting.
1423900	1427900	She's the second lightest character with the slowest falling speed,
1427900	1431900	meaning she tends to die much faster than any other character in the game.
1431900	1436900	With all this considered, it's difficult to imagine this character seeing any kind of competitive success.
1436900	1441900	This sentiment was echoed during the early parts of the game with Melee's inaugural tier list,
1441900	1445900	which placed Jigglypuff firmly in the bottom half of the cast.
1445900	1451900	However, as the game progressed, the Melee community found that Puff was a lot better than what they initially anticipated,
1451900	1454900	due in large part to two moves.
1454900	1457900	Back air is Jigglypuff's strongest aerial attack.
1457900	1463900	Thanks to a disjointed hitbox, this move provides Jigglypuff with her only powerful ranged option.
1463900	1469900	Its relatively low end lag makes it spammable, granting Puff her only real way to space out opponents.
1469900	1475900	And while back air may be Puff's most versatile move, it doesn't come close to her most game-changing move.
1482900	1484900	The premise of rest is quite simple.
1484900	1490900	Hitting the move deals massive damage and knockback, killing most characters at very low percents.
1490900	1495900	Missing the move will stun you for three seconds, basically guaranteeing your own demise.
1495900	1499900	Scoring a rest is very difficult due to the move's small hitbox,
1499900	1503900	basically requiring Puff to be on top of the opponent's character to connect.
1503900	1510900	But at the highest level of competition, the threat of getting rested forces other characters to treat Puff like a ticking time bomb.
1510900	1516900	Rest prevents opponents from aggressively rushing down Puff and smothering her with their otherwise superior attacks.
1516900	1523900	It forces other players to back down and keep their distance, as one slip-up could lead to devastating consequences.
1523900	1527900	Throughout the 2000s, players would begin to discover the power of Puff,
1527900	1533900	and the character would gradually move up Melee's tier list, peaking at number three overall in 2010,
1533900	1538900	after Hungrybox and Mango showed that Puff could dominate at the highest level.
1538900	1544900	However, on the cusp of what looked to be a Jigglypuff uprising, the character was about to run into a major roadblock.
1544900	1549900	Midway through 2010, Mango unexpectedly dropped Puff as his main,
1549900	1553900	choosing instead to move forward with Fox and Falco.
1553900	1559900	Mango's character swap marked the beginning of a trend in Melee that would go on to be known as 20XX.
1568900	1581900	By 2011, the Melee metagame had undergone more than ten years of evolution,
1581900	1584900	and its combat was starting to get very optimized.
1584900	1590900	For Melee's community, no character represented the game's optimization more than Fox.
1590900	1595900	Ever since the beginning, Fox was always considered to be a character with incredible potential,
1595900	1601900	but no one could truly harness it until the metagame had progressed beyond a high enough threshold of technical skill.
1601900	1606900	To put it simply, Fox in Melee is the fastest character in the fastest Smash game.
1606900	1613900	If played perfectly, Fox's rapid movement and attacks should theoretically overwhelm any other character in the game.
1613900	1618900	Optimal execution with Fox pushes the limits of what's humanly possible with a controller,
1618900	1623900	but that wouldn't stop many players from seeking the holy grail of peak Melee performance.
1623900	1627900	One of those players was Hax, the originator of the 20XX meme,
1627900	1632900	and widely regarded as the best Captain Falcon player in the world before switching to Fox,
1632900	1637900	much to the dismay of Captain Falcon fans who viewed the switch as a betrayal.
1637900	1642900	Mango's infamous set versus Hax supposedly came as a result of Mango trying to teach Hax a lesson
1642900	1646900	that Fox was not quite the Melee messiah that everyone envisioned.
1646900	1652900	Some of you may see this as ironic since Mango himself abandoned his original character for Fox,
1652900	1656900	but it starts to make more sense when you consider the scale of sickness.
1656900	1661900	The Melee community loves to throw around this idea of players and characters being sick.
1661900	1668900	A sick character roughly translates to a character being cool, dynamic, and generally fun to watch and play.
1668900	1674900	Arguably more important than Melee's tier list is its sick list, which by my estimate looks something like this.
1674900	1679900	You see, Hax switching from Falcon to Fox may have improved his standing on the tier list,
1679900	1684900	but he kicked himself down a peg on the sick list and the move was somewhat unpopular.
1684900	1690900	On the other hand, when Mango switched from Puff to Fox, he upgraded his sickness by a huge margin
1690900	1695900	because in the realm of Melee, no character is lamer than Jigglypuff.
1696900	1712900	For many fans of the game, Jigglypuff represents the antithesis of everything that makes Melee great.
1712900	1716900	She requires lower technical skill than the rest of the high-tier characters.
1716900	1722900	She's floaty and hard to combo, her playstyle is inherently slow, campy, and defensive.
1722900	1726900	Spectators often accuse her of being boring to watch and play.
1726900	1732900	These are many of the same points that Melee players use to claim why Brawl is an inferior successor.
1732900	1738900	And yet, sitting right inside their otherwise flawless masterpiece is a little pink blemish.
1738900	1743900	For this fundamental incongruity, Jigglypuff is Melee's black sheep.
1743900	1748900	But even the most despised character in all of Melee can still find support from some players.
1748900	1754900	One of those people was Hungrybox, who all of a sudden found himself as the number one Jigglypuff player in the world.
1754900	1761900	Unlike Mango, who had always demonstrated proficiency with a variety of characters, Hungrybox only played Puff.
1761900	1767900	Whether it was out of loyalty or necessity, Hungrybox would show up year after year, game after game,
1767900	1770900	rain or shine with the same tried and true character.
1770900	1774900	Most Melee players consider Jigglypuff to have a solid matchup spread,
1774900	1778900	having winning or even matchups with most of the other high-tier characters.
1778900	1783900	But without a doubt, Jigglypuff's most difficult matchup comes against Fox,
1783900	1788900	whose powerful vertical attacks are capable of launching Puff into the stratosphere at low percents.
1788900	1792900	Fox vs. Puff is quite possibly Melee's most intriguing matchup,
1792900	1796900	pitting the strongest offensive character against the strongest defensive character.
1796900	1800900	For ages, Fox stood mightily as Jigglypuff's only hard counter.
1800900	1806900	And as Fox began to dominate Melee's meta, the game was about to get a lot harder for Hungrybox.
1810900	1814900	By 2011, the era of the Five Gods was well underway.
1814900	1820900	Despite H-Fox's impressive 2010, his tournament results would stumble a bit in the following years.
1820900	1824900	He would grab the occasional first place at smaller events,
1824900	1828900	but would struggle to win at tournaments with more than one other god in attendance.
1828900	1832900	Although around this time, he hardly had much of an opportunity.
1832900	1835900	Melee was still very much in the midst of a competitive Dark Age,
1835900	1839900	and nationally organized tournaments were few and far between.
1839900	1843900	Despite its small underground following, the Melee community held steady,
1843900	1848900	persisting through sparse events and prize money fueled almost entirely by the love of the game itself.
1848900	1852900	Their patience would pay off when, unbeknownst to anyone at the time,
1852900	1855900	Melee would once again be thrust into the spotlight.
1858900	1862900	2013 was arguably the most influential year in Melee's history,
1862900	1866900	a year that was marked by three monumental events.
1866900	1871900	2013 oversaw the release of Project M, one of the most ambitious video game mods of all time,
1871900	1876900	which sought to reimagine what Brawl could have been had it retained Melee's fast-paced mechanics.
1876900	1882900	For the first time ever, Melee players could enjoy what they felt was a true sequel to Melee.
1882900	1889900	Also in 2013, independent filmmaker Travis Beauchamp would release the Smash Bros. documentary to critical acclaim.
1889900	1893900	The film would bring unprecedented exposure to Melee's underground scene,
1893900	1897900	and would go on to inspire a new generation of players to compete in the coming years.
1897900	1903900	But without a doubt, 2013 saw perhaps the most important event in the history of competitive Melee,
1903900	1909900	where after six long years of slumber, Super Smash Bros. Melee would return to EVO.
1909900	1912900	The announcement quickly drew in over 700 competitors,
1912900	1916900	making EVO 2013 the biggest Melee tournament to date.
1916900	1921900	And heading into the event, all eyes shifted towards the five gods of the game.
1939900	1957900	2-0
1957900	1986900	To everyone's surprise, Hungrybox found himself in winners' finals of Melee's most important tournament to date.
1986900	1992900	Even more shocking was his opponent, Wobbles, an Ice Climbers player in the twilight of his career
1992900	1997900	who managed to slay two gods on his way to one of the most improbable runs in Melee history.
1997900	2001900	Hungrybox was in prime position to become EVO champion.
2001900	2004900	All he had to do was beat Wobbles in a favorable character matchup,
2004900	2009900	and then win just one more set in grand finals, and he would claim Melee's most coveted title.
2034900	2059900	Astoundingly, Wobbles did the unthinkable by conquering a third god in a row.
2059900	2064900	To make matters worse for HBox, the moment he lost, he didn't even know that he had.
2064900	2090900	After this discouraging moment, Hungrybox had to imagine that his golden opportunity to claim the EVO crown had slipped right through his fingers.
2090900	2094900	The rest, as they say, is history.
2121900	2126900	We may never know just how influential Mango's EVO 2013 win was,
2126900	2134900	but the game's most popular player winning its biggest event was enough to catapult Melee out of the Dark Ages and into a renaissance.
2134900	2142900	It breathed new life into the game as a competitive spectacle during a time when esports were just beginning to enter the public consciousness.
2142900	2148900	In the coming years, viewership, attendance, sponsorships, and prize money would skyrocket.
2148900	2152900	After EVO 2013, Melee would never be the same.
2152900	2156900	While the game was booming, Hungrybox was slumping.
2156900	2162900	With his loss at EVO, HBox only added to his three-year-long major tournament losing streak,
2162900	2169900	and he did so in gut-wrenching fashion, not just getting upset by Wobbles, but also handing the tournament win to Mango,
2169900	2173900	who was, at the time, Hungrybox's biggest rival.
2173900	2178900	Following his EVO victory, Mango hosted a now infamous Reddit AMA,
2178900	2184900	on which Hungrybox voiced some scathing remarks about how Mango had disrespected him for his entire career.
2184900	2187900	Mango's response? Come up and get me.
2193900	2198900	2013 also saw the release of Melee's first annual player rankings.
2198900	2203900	Mango, following his monumental win at EVO, scored the number one rank.
2203900	2208900	Hungrybox, in a lackluster year, sat fifth, the worst of the best.
2208900	2213900	As 2014 rolled around, things would only get more tumultuous for Hungrybox.
2213900	2218900	This was the year that 20XX began to tip the scales of the Melee metagame.
2218900	2226900	In addition to the other gods of the game, Hungrybox now had to face a rising generation of highly technical Fox players like Hax, Leffen, and Lucky.
2226900	2231900	With each tournament, the Puff main was dealing with more threats than ever before.
2231900	2237900	If the Fox revolution wasn't enough, Hbox also faced challenges that few others could have anticipated.
2237900	2242900	During this time, Armada would frequently thwart Hbox by using Young Link,
2242900	2246900	an obscure mid-tier who was only really viable at countering Puff.
2246900	2254900	Hungrybox's losing streak would continue deep into 2014, where he would once again enter EVO in desperate need of a win.
2254900	2259900	In his most impressive performance of the year, Hungrybox would play valiantly,
2259900	2263900	beating PPMD and finally vanquishing Armada's Young Link,
2263900	2268900	only to be double eliminated by Mango, who won the tournament for the second year in a row.
2268900	2273900	What Hungrybox lacked in winning, he made up for with his flair for the dramatic.
2285900	2293900	Around this time, Hungrybox started developing a penchant for making ridiculous comebacks.
2293900	2299900	These clutch displays reminded everyone of his skill, and earned him the moniker of Clutchbox.
2299900	2304900	But improbable comebacks weren't the only dramatic traits of Hbox's play.
2304900	2309900	Much like his in-game character, Hbox too was a bit theatrical and emotional.
2309900	2315900	During this time, he was most often characterized by his explosive pop-offs after close wins.
2315900	2320900	Perhaps it was his way of confronting the growing pressure from Melee's new wave of spectators.
2320900	2326900	The combination of his god status and defensive playstyle caused many fans to actively root against him.
2326900	2333900	By the summer of 2014, Melee was no longer just a ragtag bunch of players competing mostly for bragging rights.
2333900	2339900	It was becoming a legitimate esport, with its players falling under the scrutiny of thousands of spectators.
2339900	2344900	You have to imagine that any player would have a tough time adjusting to such a drastic change,
2344900	2350900	especially in Hungrybox's case where, more often than not, the crowd was firmly against him.
2350900	2358900	2014 marked a year of tremendous growth and change for Melee, but Hungrybox ended the year exactly where he started, ranked fifth.
2358900	2364900	After a disappointing finish at the Big House, some began to question whether he still deserved his god status,
2364900	2368900	or if it was even worth it for him to continue sticking to Jigglypuff.
2368900	2374900	Fortunately for Hungrybox, the world of Melee was about to realize that he performed the best under pressure.
2388900	2399900	Here we go.
2399900	2402900	And Mew2King gives up Game 1.
2402900	2406900	You know, I really feel like Hungrybox's tag is applicable. Bruh.
2413900	2417900	Back air? Oh, that's gonna be it. Yeah, he's double back air.
2417900	2421900	Wow, and look at Mew2King. Mew2King is so upset.
2423900	2425900	Oh, he's way up there and he takes it easy.
2425900	2429900	And that is it. Beautiful job. Hungrybox beats Mew2King yet again.
2429900	2434900	Hungrybox opened 2015 with a bang by winning Paragon Orlando in dominant fashion.
2434900	2442900	At long last, HBox won a tournament with multiple other gods in attendance, snapping a losing streak dating back to 2010.
2442900	2449900	The celebration would not last long, however, as through his victory, Hungrybox had just awoken a sleeping giant.
2449900	2452900	That's it. Good night. Wow.
2452900	2455900	And just like that, Hungrybox up 2-0.
2455900	2458900	Fox? Did I hear Fox? I heard Fox.
2458900	2462900	Okay, let's see what Armada can do here.
2465900	2473900	Throughout the rise of Fox in the Melee metagame, Armada was one of the few remaining holdouts who did not pick up Fox in any capacity.
2474900	2480900	That all changed in 2015 when he determined that solo maining Peach was no longer a viable option.
2480900	2486900	Over the past several years, Hungrybox had been slowly but surely improving at the Puff-Fox matchup.
2486900	2491900	The abundance of Fox players in the meta gave Hungrybox a matchup nightmare at first,
2491900	2495900	but it also provided him with plenty of practice to learn how to counter it.
2495900	2502900	The prior years of frustration gave him enough experience to turn a daunting matchup into an increasingly winnable one.
2502900	2507900	Armada's Fox, however, was different than anything Hungrybox had ever seen before.
2507900	2514900	It was as technical as any other players, but matched the patience and discipline of Hungrybox's own playstyle.
2514900	2520900	Following Paragon, Armada's Fox would beat Hungrybox at Apex 2015, then again at Sandstorm.
2520900	2526900	After the character change, H-Box would fall to Armada 7 out of the next 8 sets they played.
2526900	2530900	But despite this new setback, Hungrybox was rising.
2530900	2536900	His tournament results were gradually improving, but more importantly, he learned how to adapt to the spotlight.
2536900	2542900	2015 featured the debut of Heal Hungrybox, where he learned to embrace his role as Melee's villain.
2550900	2555900	Hungrybox developed a cocky, brazen persona that he used to taunt hostile audiences.
2555900	2560900	And perhaps no other tournament showcased Heal H-Box better than EVO 2015,
2560900	2564900	where, for the third year in a row, Hungrybox faced off against Mango.
2585900	2615900	Mango, Mango, Mango, Mango, Mango, Mango, Mango, Mango, Mango, Mango, Mango, Mango, Mango, Mango, Mango, Mango, Mango, Mango, Mango, Mango, Mango, Mango, Mango, Mango, Mango, Mango, Mango, Mango, Mango, Mango, Mango, Mango, Mango, Mango, Mango, Mango, Mango, Mango, Mango, Mango, Mango, Mango, Mango, Mango, Mango, Mango, Mango, Mango, Mango, Mango, Mango, Mango, Mango, Mango, Mango, Mango, Mango, Mango, Mango, Mango, Mango, Mango, Mango, Mango, Mango, Mango, Mango, Mango, Mango, Mango, Mango, Mango, Mango, Mango, M
2615900	2645900	Mango, Mango, Mango, Mango, Mango, Mango, Mango, Mango, Mango, Mango, Mango, Mango, Mango, Mango, Mango, Mango, Mango, Mango, Mango, Mango, Mango, Mango, Mango, Mango, Mango, Mango, Mango, Mango, Mango, Mango, Mango, Mango, Mango, Mango, Mango, Mango, Mango, Mango, Mango, Mango, Mango, Mango, Mango, Mango, Mango, Mango, Mango, Mango, Mango, Mango, Mango, Mango, Mango, Mango, Mango, Mango, Mango, Mango, Mango, Mango, Mango, Mango, Mango, Mango, Mango, Mango, Mango, Mango, Mango, Mango, Mango, Mango, Mango, Mango, M
2645900	2675900	Hungrybox would then go on to beat PPMD and return to EVO Grand Finals before losing once more to Armada's Fox. Although he equaled his placement from the prior year, EVO 2015 felt different. Hungrybox had finally bested his greatest rival on the biggest stage. He looked stronger and more confident in his
2675900	2705900	game than ever before. EVO 2015 represented a major turning point in HBox's career where he toppled one rival for another to take their place. From that day on, Hungrybox had his sights set on Armada.
2705900	2711740	He was even far more closer to solving his Fox. He may have been totally stumped if it weren't for a little help from Captain Crunch.
2717180	2725740	Crunch was a Fox player from Hungrybox's hometown of Orlando. After a disappointing finish at CEO 2015, their hometown tournament,
2726220	2734660	HBox and Crunch started talking about how to deal with Puff's most difficult matchup. Soon after, Crunch assumed the role of Hungrybox's full-time coach and
2734980	2742420	after losing to Armada at the Big House, HBox and Crunch made it their mission to analyze Armada's play style and find a way to beat him.
2742780	2750020	For weeks, Hungrybox dedicated himself to study and grind the matchup so that the next time they met in bracket, he would be prepared.
2764660	2771660	With his win against Armada, Hungrybox had proven that he could conquer anyone and everyone that Melee had to offer. He had spent a whole year building himself up as Melee's unstoppable villain, but after perhaps the most monumental win of his career so far, the pompous, arrogant HBox unexpectedly
2794660	2796660	broke down in tears.
2818580	2822820	There's an interview segment somewhere on YouTube featuring four of the five gods.
2823300	2827900	Hungrybox was supposed to be there too, but due to a scheduling conflict, he couldn't participate.
2828500	2834660	The producers decided to replace Hungrybox with a cardboard cutout of Hungrybox. An amusing prop,
2834660	2839380	but also a disturbingly accurate metaphor of how many in the Smash community view him.
2852820	2865220	It seems that Juan has always had a hard time fitting in, dating all the way back to his childhood when his family emigrated from Argentina to the United States.
2865900	2870740	You have to imagine that it's not exactly easy to make a lot of friends at school when most of your
2870860	2875740	classmates don't even speak the same language as you. Things at home weren't much better for him either.
2876060	2882720	Juan's domestic life was often thrown into turmoil by his father, who would mismanage his family's wealth and outright abandon them
2882720	2885000	in pursuit of his own fruitless business ventures.
2885280	2892660	Juan's complex relationship with his father and the world around him ultimately created the competitor you see today, for better or for worse.
2893120	2901400	The conflict Juan faced growing up instilled in him a powerful work ethic and unparalleled mental fortitude that he used to excel in melee and in life.
2901720	2906940	All those losses over the years suddenly become a lot more reasonable when you realize that HBox was
2907020	2911960	balancing melee with a full-time student workload, and then a full-time job as an engineer.
2912600	2920260	Here's the amazing thing about going through school and working your ass off.
2920260	2924620	You know how many times I did my own homework? I have more EVO wins than I did my homework.
2924720	2930780	There's another video on YouTube that intercuts Hungrybox's graduation speech with Mango's high school stories.
2931140	2936760	The juxtaposition here is fascinating. Unlike HBox, Mango never tried at school.
2936800	2940840	He risked all of his life's prospects to become the best melee player in the world and
2941320	2947580	ultimately succeeded. That part of Mango's personality represents the spirit of competitive melee as a whole,
2948000	2955240	a community that was never supposed to succeed, never supposed to make it as far as they did, never supposed to outlast the other Smash games.
2955400	2962160	And yet, against all odds, they did. Some melee fans like to imagine that Hungrybox would still be successful
2962160	2969120	even if he never picked up a controller, that Hungrybox never needed melee, and that melee doesn't need Hungrybox.
2970000	2975080	This game has been my escape for over a decade from whatever else life offers.
2975200	2979720	And for everyone else, if that's the same for you, I love you, and thank you for coming!
2980280	2986480	After moving to America, Hungrybox used melee as a way to fit in, as a way to make friends, and as a way to seek
2986480	2994360	refuge from the turbulent environment around him. Hungrybox needed melee as much as anyone else. His passion for the game is undeniable.
2994800	3001560	But soon enough, he would find that the very community from which he sought comfort and acceptance was beginning to reject him.
3001680	3005680	Like everything else in his life, it only gave him a bigger chip on his shoulder.
3006560	3012920	And they hurl insults at you, and they tell you, you know, all the worst things you could imagine with no
3014120	3021520	respect or no care for what's going on in your personal life. No, they don't give a rat's ass about that.
3021520	3025240	They just care that you play a really gay jigglypuff.
3026320	3028320	And I came close.
3028680	3033840	You know, came really close to just giving up, to quitting. I did.
3036000	3040720	I'll play this game for 20 more years, if that's what it takes to be the best player in the world.
3040720	3047320	Hungrybox ended 2015 ranked second behind Armada.
3047320	3053320	Fueled by his newfound belief that he could beat anyone, Hungrybox entered 2016 on a warpath.
3063320	3067960	The first half of the year was marked by Hungrybox and Armada swapping tournament wins.
3068280	3075040	Both competitors were playing at the highest caliber of their entire careers, and they looked to be on a collision course heading into Evo.
3078680	3085120	Evo 2016 would represent the absolute peak of Melee as a competitive game. The tournament drew more than
3085820	3089200	2,300 entrants, a figure not matched before or since.
3089920	3095960	For Hungrybox, his path was clear. Make it back to grand finals where, more likely than not,
3096440	3102000	Armada would be there waiting for him. This time, however, Hungrybox would know how to beat him.
3106000	3108240	Truly, it would be a battle for the ages.
3125960	3132160	Whoa, all right! Hungrybox with a 2-0 victory over ChillahDude.
3146400	3152520	Being down this much, even without time, is hard. Classic Hungrybox, my man's a top 8.
3155960	3159960	But I really like him, so we count him.
3160960	3162960	One is done, zero grabs this one.
3162960	3165960	Yeah, yeah, no, whoa! Yeah, no jumps, no pounds!
3165960	3169960	Hungrybox down the king, the winner's bracket, 1-0.
3169960	3176960	He's putting these hitboxes right outside of where Hbox wants to be, this is the needle, he's trying to snipe his jumps, what's he gonna get?
3176960	3181960	Hungrybox is dead! 2-0! And Plump advances in the winner's side!
3182960	3184960	Hungrybox going down to the loser's bracket.
3185960	3186960	Yo, the assassin needle!
3187960	3196960	As the story goes, following his loss to Plump in winner's semifinals, Hungrybox was so discouraged that he almost checked out of the tournament entirely.
3196960	3204960	All of a sudden, the memories of his past failures all came rushing back, along with the bleak realization that this year would be no different.
3204960	3210960	Although he adorned the nickname of Clutch, he had never actually won a major tournament from the loser's bracket.
3210960	3214960	For a brief moment in his mind, his fate was sealed.
3214960	3221960	For all the progress he made and as far as he came, Hungrybox could not win on the biggest stage when it mattered the most.
3221960	3226960	He likely would have been finished too, if it weren't for a little help from Captain Crunch.
3226960	3233960	Sometime in the interval between matches, Crunch was able to calm Hbox down and refresh his mindset for the next match.
3233960	3238960	Sometimes, before you can learn how to win, you have to learn how to lose.
3238960	3245960	It was at this moment that Hungrybox truly became Clutch, because after all, there was still so much melee left to play.

3491960	3495960	And then the moment that changed Melee forever.
3521960	3524960	And then the moment that changed Melee forever.
3552960	3555960	And then the moment that changed Melee forever.
3575960	3579960	Sometimes the only thing you need to win is believing that you can.
3579960	3585960	In Melee, the difference between winning and losing can often come down to just a few pixels and a few frames.
3585960	3590960	But the difference between winners and losers feels far, far greater.
3590960	3594960	For years, Hungrybox embodied the competitor who was never quite good enough.
3594960	3597960	He was always so close, yet so far.
3597960	3603960	EVO 2016 changed all of that, and Hungrybox walked out of that building a completely different player.
3603960	3608960	After accomplishing what he did, nothing could stop him from becoming the best in the world.
3608960	3613960	From that moment on, Hungrybox would never be the same, and neither would Melee.
3618960	3623960	After conquering his greatest challenge yet, Hungrybox fell into a bit of a slump.
3623960	3627960	After starting the year on fire, he would not win another tournament after EVO,
3627960	3631960	finishing second in the rankings, once again trailing Armada.
3631960	3636960	Following a disappointing loss of the Big House, he would take a moment to pause and re-evaluate his life.
3637960	3643960	Perhaps guided by those discouraging words that haunted him for his entire career, he knew what he had to do.
3643960	3648960	At the end of 2016, Hungrybox quit his job to play Melee full-time.
3651960	3655960	At first, his newfound commitment to the game didn't seem to change much.
3655960	3660960	It didn't help that it coincided with possibly the most dominant stretch of Armada's career.
3660960	3665960	But then, late in the year, Hungrybox started winning, and then he kept on winning.
3665960	3671960	If he could score a victory at the Big House, HBox could put himself in serious contention for the number one ranking.
3671960	3677960	His rival Armada would fall to Plup, who was in the midst of an incredible winner's bracket run.
3677960	3683960	Hungrybox would stumble early, then proceed to tear through the loser's bracket to meet Plup in Grand Finals.
3683960	3689960	As the crowd rallied around the underdog Plup to complete his fairytale run, the glass slipper broke.
3696960	3702960	There was no pop-up after Hungrybox double-eliminated Plup to capture his first Big House title.
3702960	3706960	He just slowly turned his gaze towards the now lifeless crowd.
3706960	3713960	A few people clapped. A couple cheered. Most had already begun filing for the exits without saying a word.
3725960	3728960	I feel like I left part of me on that stage today.
3728960	3733960	You ever have everything you ever wanted, and then when you finally have it, you're like, now what?
3733960	3739960	One year ago, after the very same tournament, Hungrybox decided that he was ready to become Melee's best player.
3739960	3743960	He never stopped to consider whether Melee was ready for him.
3743960	3745960	Be careful what you wish for, Juan.
3755960	3783960	And so we enter the era of HBox as the number one Melee player.
3783960	3787960	An era characterized by two remarkable shifts in Melee.
3787960	3791960	The first of which being the end of the five gods dominating the game.
3791960	3800960	The untouchable status of the gods had been in decline ever since 2016, after PPMD was forced to take an indefinite leave of absence due to medical issues.
3800960	3804960	To this day, he has still not returned to competitive play.
3804960	3812960	The four remaining gods continued to hold the keys to the kingdom through 2017, but many were beginning to tell that the end was near.
3812960	3830960	2018 saw the year's two biggest events fall to new contenders, with Plup taking Genesis and Leffen taking EVO.
3830960	3840960	Midway through 2018, Armada seemed poised to retake the number one rank from Hungrybox, only to shock everyone by announcing a sudden retirement from Melee singles competition.
3840960	3848960	Although never explicitly mentioned, many have attributed his retirement to the constant stress he suffered from trying to keep pace with Hungrybox.
3848960	3856960	For me, I feel like if I can't have fun doing it, then there's no point in doing it.
3856960	3863960	At around the same time, Mew2King started shifting his focus away from Melee in favor of streaming and writing his book.
3863960	3871960	In 2019, Mew2King only competed in four events and looks unlikely to return to full-time competition anytime soon.
3871960	3877960	Mango, perhaps the most dominant player ever in his prime, failed to win a tournament in 2018.
3877960	3888960	And while he can still crank out the occasional epic performance, his inconsistency has relegated him to a shadow of his former glory, placing his god status in serious question.
3888960	3896960	These days, it seems that Hungrybox is the only god left who can still strike fear into the hearts of his opponents through his sheer dominance alone.
3896960	3900960	In his time, there were four others like him. Now, there's just one.
3903960	3910960	The current state of Melee is represented partly by the decline of the gods, but mostly by something far more confounding.
3910960	3913960	Hungrybox always wanted to become the best in the world.
3913960	3920960	He struggled through years of frustration, gradually improving and eventually defeating the best players that Melee had to offer.
3920960	3926960	But when he finally achieved his life's goal, he began to realize that the promised land didn't exactly come as promised.
3926960	3931960	Becoming number one in the world was the hardest thing Hungrybox had done in his entire life.
3931960	3935960	He was about to find out that being number one was even harder.
3935960	3940960	It's common for sports or games to generally dislike their most dominant competitors.
3940960	3946960	But in all these cases, most of the hatred never strays far from the confines of the competitive landscape.
3946960	3954960	You hate Tom Brady when he destroys your favorite team in the playoffs, but if you saw him walking down the street, you'd probably want his autograph.
3954960	3959960	In Melee, the hatred for Hungrybox has progressed far beyond a simple competitive rivalry.
3959960	3964960	A large fraction of the Melee community seem to treat Hungrybox with utter contempt.
3964960	3971960	A lot of this comes from the idea that, by simply being the number one player, Hungrybox is killing the game.
3971960	3979960	Much of this rhetoric stems from players like Leffen, who has assumed the role of Hungrybox's arch-rival following Armada's retirement.
3979960	3986960	Leffen is perhaps the biggest proponent of the Puff Doomsday Theory, a scenario I have unofficially labeled 20FF.
3986960	3998960	Leffen believes that Jigglypuff is not only the strongest character, but the easiest to play.
3998960	4005960	In the year 20FF, no one plays Fox anymore because everyone has switched to Puff in order to beat Hungrybox.
4005960	4013960	Melee games have devolved into boring, unwatchable stall fests where the only measure of winning is determined by which Puff player can out-camp the other.
4013960	4021960	A compelling theory until you realize that Hungrybox is the only Puff player in the top 35, and has been for basically the past decade.
4021960	4029960	Even now, entering year 3 of Hungrybox as Melee's top player, Jigglypuff mains are still few and far between.
4029960	4041960	If Puff was truly such an unskilled, overpowered character as many of its ardent critics like to claim, then surely someone, anyone else could have risen to the top of the Melee metagame besides HBox.
4041960	4052960	20FF theorists will often counter this by saying that playing Puff is so boring that hardly anyone is willing to play as the character even if it could vastly improve their tournament results.
4052960	4060960	They say this despite the great number of Ice Climbers players who only practice wobbling setups for the sole purpose of cheesing tournament wins.
4060960	4065960	In a competitive game, it's no surprise that people will do anything to win.
4065960	4073960	You play to win the game. Hello?
4073960	4082960	And at some point, you have to account for the fact that Hungrybox is the only Puff player in the modern era who has been able to consistently win.
4082960	4089960	That's the great thing about sports. You play to win. You don't play to just play it.
4089960	4098960	The same critics also like to claim that Puff is as boring to watch as it is to play and that Melee is hemorrhaging viewers for as long as HBox is on top.
4098960	4106960	Even though in 2019, during Hungrybox's most dominant stretch, peak viewership actually increased across most tournaments.
4106960	4113960	This is consistent with many other spectator sports. By and large, audiences tune in to watch juggernauts.
4113960	4117960	Michael Jordan was possibly the most dominant player in NBA history.
4117960	4124960	As he led the Bulls to their sixth championship in eight seasons, the NBA set their all-time record for television viewership.
4124960	4128960	The next season, after Jordan's retirement, ratings plummeted.
4128960	4135960	The same pattern can be observed in golf, whose ratings are notoriously dependent on whether Tiger Woods is in contention.
4135960	4138960	The trend even holds true in games you wouldn't expect.
4138960	4143960	During James Holzhauer's 22-game Jeopardy! winning streak, ratings skyrocketed.
4143960	4150960	Do you think the same number of people tuned in a month afterwards when the show returned to its regular, unremarkable contestants?
4150960	4157960	When people watch stuff, they want stakes. They want to follow a story. They want antagonists to root against.
4157960	4162960	Dominant players are inherently interesting because they fulfill all of these things.
4162960	4169960	But that still doesn't stop a vocal portion of the community from zealously believing that Hungrybox is single-handedly killing Melee.
4169960	4176960	I'm basically trying to say Hungrybox deserves more credit, and people discredit him because he's been winning for so long.
4176960	4182960	Hungrybox victories are treated like funerals, while his defeats are celebrated like God's gift to the game.
4182960	4186960	The goal of the game for many has devolved into stopping HBox.
4186960	4191960	The Smash community as a whole has a tendency to rally hard against their top players.
4191960	4196960	In Smash 4, the sequel gained a brawl. No one was better than Zero.
4196960	4203960	At one point, he won 56 tournaments in a row, a record that will likely never be broken by any other Smash competitor.
4203960	4208960	His staggering winning streak also spawned an insatiable desire to see him lose,
4208960	4212960	and after three years of constant pressure and harassment from the Smash 4 community,
4212960	4217960	Zero lost all passion for the game and retired from competition entirely.
4217960	4221960	Even Armada at his peak faced a considerable amount of hate in Melee,
4221960	4225960	despite being one of the most widely respected players of all time.
4225960	4229960	Even though he also dominated with a pink, floaty, defensive character,
4229960	4233960	not many people considered Armada to be a threat to the game itself.
4233960	4240960	Nothing Armada faced ever came close to the amount of bitterness and vitriol that Hungrybox tolerates on a regular basis.
4240960	4248960	His eternal reward for struggling and clawing to Melee's top rank is to be perhaps the most ostracized top player of any game ever played.
4248960	4254960	At least perennially hated teams like the Patriots can return to their home crowd and be cheered.
4254960	4261960	It doesn't matter where Hungrybox goes today. Nobody cheers him. He can never be applauded for his achievements.
4261960	4264960	Many in the Melee community say he deserves the hate.
4264960	4272960	In addition to the prevailing belief that he's ruining the game, many are quick to express their sheer disgust for HBox as a person.
4272960	4279960	Some decry his unwillingness to play friendlies or mentor other players, as he tends to guard his Jigglypuff gameplay as a trade secret.
4279960	4285960	Others cite instances of his infidelity in past relationships as an indictment against his morals.
4285960	4291960	Most just accuse Hungrybox of being generally rude or egotistical based on interactions from years ago.
4291960	4296960	There's a saying in the Melee community that everyone has an HBox story, me included.
4296960	4302960	I mean this one time I saw Hungrybox at a grocery store in Gainesville, but I won't get into that here.
4302960	4309960	The point is that Melee players can usually pull out a laundry list of reasons for why they detest HBox on a personal level.
4309960	4313960	And for that reason, he gets scrutinized more than any other player in the game.
4313960	4318960	Athletes like Michael Jordan and Tiger Woods each had their own share of personal demons.
4318960	4324960	But their respective audiences were both able to look past that and appreciate their accomplishments as competitors.
4324960	4330960	It seems that the Melee community has an all too difficult time applying the same treatment to Hungrybox.
4330960	4336960	They like to assume that everything HBox does has some nefarious self-serving plan behind it.
4336960	4342960	It got bad enough to where Hungrybox couldn't even look at his watch on stage without facing backlash and drama.
4342960	4352960	It's as if Melee people have such a low opinion of HBox that they couldn't give him the benefit of the doubt that he may have been running late for a flight and wanted to keep track of the time.
4352960	4356960	It doesn't matter how much he reforms his actions and attitude today.
4356960	4362960	Hungrybox has always been held to his lowest standard and he's never allowed to overcome his past reputation.
4363960	4375960	Perhaps the community's apparent zero tolerance policy for rudeness and ego would make a little more sense if they also applied it to Leffen, who publicly disrespects other players, games, and communities on a weekly basis.
4375960	4381960	But alas, Leffen, like every other player, gets cheered wildly over Hungrybox.
4381960	4390960	After a while, the whole list of grievances against Juan Hungrybox de Biedma reads like sour grapes, double standards, and empty excuses.
4390960	4395960	At the end of the day, the Melee community stigmatizes HBox for the same reason they always have.
4395960	4398960	He doesn't fit into their idea of what Melee should be.
4398960	4404960	The mere existence of Hungrybox challenges the fundamental identity of the game itself.
4404960	4410960	Melee prides itself on its fast-paced gameplay, yet its top player uses one of the slowest characters.
4410960	4418960	Melee celebrates its highly skilled technical mechanics, yet its top player uses the character with the most simplistic controls.
4418960	4426960	Melee relies on its risky and aggressive play styles to wow its spectators, yet its top player plays patiently and defensively.
4426960	4431960	Hungrybox can never be truly respected because Hungrybox isn't Melee.
4431960	4434960	But allow me to explain to you how he is.
4438960	4440960	It's July 9th, 2013.
4440960	4448960	After raising more than $90,000 for charity, the Melee community punched a ticket for their beloved franchise to return to EVO.
4448960	4454960	After six long years of waiting, the biggest Melee tournament in history was less than a week away.
4454960	4456960	This could be Melee's big break.
4456960	4463960	If the talent can put on a good enough show, Melee may finally be recognized for the brilliant competitive masterpiece it is.
4463960	4471960	With less than three days to go before the tournament, Nintendo blocked EVO from streaming Melee to the absolute shock of the Smash community.
4471960	4477960	Eventually, after a sizable amount of backlash, Nintendo allowed the event to proceed as normal.
4477960	4480960	But the message had been delivered loud and clear.
4480960	4484960	Nintendo would never truly respect Smash as a competitive game.
4484960	4489960	No matter how popular competitive Melee got, the community would always be on their own.
4489960	4493960	It didn't really make much of a difference because that's how it had always been.
4493960	4503960	But in an age where most game developers embrace competitive play by bankrolling huge tournament pots, it's discouraging to realize that Melee will never have that privilege.
4503960	4508960	2019 saw a Fortnite player earn $3 million by winning a single tournament.
4508960	4513960	That's nearly ten times the prize money that Hungrybox has won in his entire career.
4513960	4520960	A career in which he consistently placed top five at more than a dozen tournaments per year for over a decade.
4520960	4529960	It's sad to think that top Melee players who are so talented and draw in so many viewers often have a hard time affording rent from tournament winnings alone.
4529960	4534960	Melee fans love Mango because Mango represents how they see Melee.
4534960	4539960	What many of them don't consider is that Hungrybox represents how the rest of the world sees Melee.
4539960	4546960	Other Smash players often regard Melee players as rude and arrogant, and they actively root against Melee success.
4546960	4551960	Casual players are often hostile to the idea that Smash is even played competitively at all.
4551960	4557960	Much of the Smash fandom can't even comprehend the reasoning behind turning off items in tournament play.
4557960	4566960	When Melee was removed from the evil lineup in 2019, many people celebrated, saying that Melee no longer deserved the spotlight.
4566960	4571960	Lots of people in the general fighting game community believe that Melee never deserved the spotlight it got.
4571960	4579960	The Smash Bros franchise and Nintendo games in general have been stigmatized as kids games ever since they censored blood in Mortal Kombat.
4579960	4584960	Many traditional fighting game players don't respect competitive Smash for this very reason.
4584960	4588960	They can't take a game seriously if it was never intended for serious play.
4588960	4598960	Because Smash is a kid-friendly, casual-friendly game, the FGC likes to assume that it's easy and claim that competitive Smash players don't have the skill to lace their boots.
4598960	4610960	As long as Smash players don't have to memorize button combinations with quarter circles, that must mean that their controls are crude and basic and that you don't need to put in any real effort to win a Smash tournament.
4610960	4615960	All this sound familiar? Well, that's because Melee sees Hungrybox how the rest of Smash sees Melee.
4615960	4619960	The fighting game community treats Smash how Melee treats Hungrybox.
4619960	4624960	You may not want to believe it, but Hungrybox is Melee in the most literal sense.
4624960	4630960	Both spent years being told they weren't good enough, that they would never achieve what they would eventually become.
4630960	4637960	Both were constantly disrespected, stigmatized, and ridiculed because they didn't quite fit into what others thought they should be.
4637960	4641960	Both were able to succeed even though everyone else wanted them to fail.
4641960	4652960	Both have a huge chip on their shoulder because no matter what they accomplish, how many challenges they overcome, and how much they prove themselves, they will never get the respect they deserve.
4652960	4662960	In the countless, endless online arguments between the FGC and Smash, Melee fans will always defend their game by saying just because it's different doesn't mean it's easy.
4662960	4666960	Every time this happens, Hungrybox just shakes his head and sighs.
4667960	4677960	It's hard for everyone. It's a lot easier for Puff or Falco or Fox. It's all hard to win in front of us. So, just get better.
4680960	4687960	Hungrybox is Melee. And you know what else? Hungrybox is the best in the world.
4687960	4692960	And as much as some people would tell you otherwise, Melee has never been more interesting.
4692960	4696960	2019 saw Hungrybox win 12 of the 20 tournaments he entered.
4696960	4702960	It also saw a Pikachu main and a Captain Falcon main win majors for the first time in the history of the game.
4702960	4708960	So despite Melee entering its 20th year of competitive play, it appears to be far from a solved game.
4708960	4714960	And that's because despite how many people bought into 20XX, Jigglypuff is the meta.
4714960	4723960	While the rise of Fox encouraged many players to get increasingly faster and more aggressive, the rise of Hungrybox has forced many of them back to the drawing board.
4723960	4731960	Even though the new era has been tough on Foxes, it has led to the rise of a new generation of players with more patient, strategic playstyles.
4731960	4738960	Players like Zane, Wizzrobe, and Amsa have all demonstrated the capacity to beat Hungrybox without a favorable character matchup.
4738960	4747960	At times, despite his recent dominance, Hungrybox has never looked more vulnerable, frequently losing to players and characters that he never has before.
4747960	4754960	This is mostly due to how, at long last, the rest of Melee's competition is finally catching up to the level of the gods.
4754960	4761960	In present-day Melee, the gods are the old generation and Hungrybox is the last of the gods.
4761960	4767960	Melee is approaching the precipice of an entirely new era and Hungrybox remains the last stickler of the old days.
4767960	4771960	In a way, Hungrybox carries the torch of all the gods.
4771960	4776960	Newer players will never know the satisfaction of challenging a prime Mango, Armada, or PPMD.
4776960	4780960	For them, facing Hungrybox is the next best thing.
4780960	4790960	He represents one of the few remaining links between old and new Melee, and as much as some Melee fans would like to forget, he's an integral part of the game's history and legacy.
4790960	4795960	Hungrybox, like Melee, is still going strong all these years later.
4795960	4801960	In 2018, Nintendo released the fifth installment to the Smash franchise with Super Smash Bros. Ultimate.
4801960	4812960	So far, it has been the first Smash title to successfully appeal to both sides of the competitive community, with players like Armada, Leffen, and even Hungrybox frequenting Ultimate events.
4812960	4818960	However, despite the popularity of Ultimate, Melee still consistently surpasses it in viewership.
4818960	4824960	Even in its advanced age, Melee is the future and shows no signs of dying off anytime soon.
4824960	4832960	There will come a day when Hungrybox stops playing Melee, and in his absence, the game will become that much less interesting as a result.
4832960	4840960	And now, at long last, we return to the crab, perhaps the most enduring symbol of Melee's relationship with Hungrybox.
4840960	4846960	Crab mentality refers to the unwillingness of a community to let its individuals succeed.
4846960	4855960	It's based on the behavior of crabs in a bucket, who will often prevent their peers from escaping by pulling them back from the brink of freedom, thus dooming them all.
4855960	4861960	If Melee is to survive in the future, they'll have to learn to tolerate their top player.
4861960	4865960	By trying to destroy HBox, they're only destroying themselves.
4865960	4869960	Because at the end of the day, Hungrybox is Juan de Biedma.
4869960	4874960	Despite playing for the past decade with the status of God, he's only human.
4874960	4878960	It is my personal belief that human beings are naturally meant to persevere.
4878960	4888960	No matter what happens, as long as we simply make the decision not to give up, it simply does get better if you believe it will.
4888960	4899960	There's certain experiences that even thinking about, even the act of thinking about it sets you back, maybe all the way back to all the work you've done just by thinking about it.
4899960	4901960	But that's not the point.
4901960	4904960	The point is, you need to focus on the fact that you overcame it.
4904960	4908960	And if you're going through it, focus on the fact that you are choosing to overcome it.
4908960	4913960	You're pushing through, and that's more than anyone can ask of you.
4914960	4916960	Will HBox ever overcome the hate?
4916960	4925960	That remains to be seen, but until that happens, he will always have a reason to keep fighting, to overcome perhaps his greatest challenge yet.
4925960	4930960	And if there's one thing the Melee community has learned over the years, it's to never count out Hungrybox.
4930960	4935960	The one player in Melee who spent his entire career doing stuff that couldn't be done.
4935960	4940960	I said I'll be top 5 jigs in Florida, I'll be best jigs in Florida, I'll be top 3 in Florida, I'll be the best player in Florida.
4940960	4945960	One day I'll be the best player on the East Coast, and maybe, who knows, one day I'll be the best player in the world.
4945960	4948960	Just how did Hungrybox get so good?
4948960	4954960	The truth is that Hungrybox became the best in the world not because he learned how to win, but because he learned how to lose.
4955960	4966960	So yeah, he may get upset by Unranked Albert or 4-stock by Zayne or 6-0'd by Leffen, but after every defeat, you can count on HBox to pick up the pieces, come back later, and win.
4966960	4974960	Hopefully one day Melee will learn to appreciate Hungrybox while they still can, because there will never ever be another player like him.
4974960	4984960	Hungrybox! Hungrybox! Hungrybox! Hungrybox! Hungrybox! Hungrybox!
