0	16700	Welcome everyone to a new series that I call Frying Comments.
16700	21360	Now some of my older viewers will remember that years ago I made a few videos thumping
21360	29440	some hapless goobers in my comment section.
29440	33200	And needless to say, this video is not that.
33200	38320	All of you have probably seen your fair share of comment response videos on YouTube where
38320	44000	big and proud YouTubers sarcastically mock the utter peons beneath them as the slime
44000	45800	between their toes.
45800	47520	This video is not that.
47520	51640	Oh no, I'm not flying over anyone's heads here.
51640	55960	All of you who watch me know that my spiral only points in one direction.
55960	60720	And that's down, down, down, which is exactly where I'm going today.
60720	65640	Because in this series, we're not dealing with your average, everyday criticism.
65640	69040	This is advanced criticism.
69040	73640	Today we are sinking to depths that no channel of my size should ever reach.
73640	77760	We are reaching levels of pettiness that shouldn't even be possible.
77760	82960	Today we aren't just glazing over an eclectic compilation of posts as you may expect from
82960	84240	a video like this.
84240	90760	Rather, we are going to examine just a single comment, posted over a year ago, that nobody
90760	92440	cares about.
92440	104960	Nobody besides me.
104960	110080	Lol you're hopping onto whatever bandwagon you can to try and get as many views as possible
110080	112040	and spread your unfunny shit.
112040	115240	It's a shame your fanbase can't see past this.
115240	120440	The commenter here assumes that I'm trend-hopping based on my video's trendy subject matter.
120440	124500	While I would disagree with this claim, the important aspect here is what would lead someone
124500	126040	to make this claim.
126040	131040	Looking at my channel now, seeing me make videos about Dale Earnhardt, court cases,
131040	135040	and Leafy more than a year after people stopped watching him, it's pretty obvious that I'm
135040	137320	not quite the trendiest YouTube channel.
137320	142000	But at the time this comment was posted, this was actually a much more reasonable claim,
142000	143960	considering the era that preceded it.
143960	147760	Those of you who are new to the channel may not actually know this, but I used to make
147760	149700	YouTube poops.
149700	155320	For the first five years of this channel, all I did was make YouTube poops, a time period
155320	158880	which constitutes the primary focus of this video.
158880	160640	Let's find out why.
160640	165780	The YTP community has seen so many amazing and talented people leave the community or
165780	169760	simply stop making videos for various reasons.
169760	175680	Why the fuck are we stuck with you?
175680	179580	I've never really had a good relationship with the YTP community.
179580	182360	For the longest time, I was totally isolated.
182360	183960	I never talked to anybody.
183960	186080	All I really did was watch and listen.
186080	190560	I can't really say for sure what exactly I did to get on people's nerves, but I can
190560	192820	make an educated guess.
192820	198000	Now the idea of drama in the YTP community may seem shocking and counterintuitive to
198000	207960	many of you, but believe me, it exists.
207960	212120	How could such silly videos lead to such bitterness and resentment?
212120	213800	I can't really explain it.
213800	217680	I guess it's like any other online community where some people are loved and some people
217680	222920	are hated, and more often than not, I tend to fall on the side of the hated.
222920	224800	Maybe it's because I didn't talk enough.
224800	227080	Maybe it's because I talked too much.
227080	232260	No one has ever given me a comprehensive explanation, so the best I can do is speculate.
232260	235120	That's all I've been able to do for all this time.
235120	237940	Maybe this comment can lead me to some answers.
237940	242780	Your fans are a bunch of easily amused fucking idiots who find shitty content creators like
242780	244120	you entertaining.
244120	248740	The only reason you even had a large number of subs in the first place is because of those
248740	253560	Pixar YTPs you made, which were pretty fucking shit to begin with.
253560	257720	Your actual non-Pixar content wasn't earning you many subs.
257720	259880	The sentiment here is pretty clear.
259880	264840	My YTPs are more popular than they deserve to be, and I don't necessarily disagree
264840	266000	with that.
266000	272280	In mid-2013, I had less than 4,000 subscribers, and then I uploaded The Uncredibles, a video
272280	274160	that changed everything.
274160	279060	It was my first video to reach a million views, and the popularity of this video carried over
279060	284180	to six of my next YTPs, which would also pass a million views.
284180	289220	To this day, nearly six years later, more people have watched The Uncredibles than any
289220	291080	other video on my channel.
291080	294780	So did I make these videos with the intent of getting popular on YouTube?
294780	298400	Well, no, but I can understand why people may think that.
298400	304660	The source material is very common and accessible, consisting of SpongeBob and Pixar movies,
304660	309340	which contrasts heavily with the more obscure sources of older YTPs.
309340	313380	Looking at this aspect, one could infer that I specifically chose these sources with the
313380	315740	intent of getting lots of views.
315740	319720	In reality, The Uncredibles was only just supposed to be the next video in line and
319720	320840	nothing else.
320840	325440	The fact that it, among these other videos, got so popular had to do more with the audience
325440	329540	selectively preferring the source material because it was so accessible.
329540	333380	The reason I chose these sources in the first place was because I watched them a lot as
333380	338540	a kid and I wanted to remix them, not because I wanted more people to watch them.
338540	343000	A lot of people also seemed to miss that during this time, I didn't exclusively upload what
343000	348780	you'd call trendy sources, and consequently, those videos received far less views.
348780	351440	None of this was ever by design on my end.
351440	355680	To put it simply, if I was in the business of getting views, I probably wouldn't have
355680	359140	spent five straight years making YouTube poops.
359140	363780	In the vast majority of cases, YTPs don't get many views.
363780	369340	So when my YTPs all of a sudden started getting many, many views, I and a lot of other people
369340	370860	didn't know how to react.
370860	377220	I started 2013 getting a few thousand views on my videos and I ended 2014 getting millions.
377220	380620	Did my videos get a thousand percent more entertaining?
380620	383340	Was I putting in a thousand percent more effort?
383340	385020	No, obviously not.
385020	389340	Personally, I thought I was making them about the same as all my older videos, but with
389340	394540	that being said, my sudden meteoric rise in popularity was met with skepticism by a lot
394540	399100	of people in the YTP community, and a lot of people were beginning to sense a great
399100	403620	inequity between the views I got and the views they thought I deserved.
403620	408900	I began to notice it sometime in the spring of 2014 after uploading my second Incredibles
408900	410980	video, The Non-Credibles.
410980	415300	On this video, I received comments from two other well-known YouTube poopers, Hurricoaster
415300	416780	and Chemistry Guy.
416780	421520	I remember both of these comments offering some shockingly blunt criticism of what they
421520	427260	perceived as a change in my style, each delivered with the implication that I had sold out to
427260	429360	a more mainstream audience.
429360	432180	At the time, I found these comments very discouraging.
432180	438220	How these two poopers whom I admired and respected were utterly disappointed in how I had changed.
438260	441140	The problem was that I didn't think I had changed.
441140	445680	I figured my process with this video had been the same as it was years ago when I had made
445680	448020	videos that they supposedly enjoyed.
448020	453900	The only real difference in my mind was that now I was popular, while then I was a nobody.
453900	459040	Clearly, the notion that these guys were disappointed implies that at one time they had high expectations
459040	463480	of me, and the fact that they decided to critique me directly indicates that they only had my
463480	464860	best interests in mind.
465040	469380	I still respect both of these guys, and both of them still leave comments on my stuff every
469380	474880	now and then, but these two comments left on this video really bothered me, mostly because
474880	478320	I could never reconcile their newfound perception of me.
478320	482340	Over time, I could really only conclude that they disliked my videos because they were
482340	487380	popular, and I reinforced this idea about a year later in the spring of 2015.
494860	505700	I had uploaded Deep Frying Nemo, the final installment of my quest to remix the entirety
505700	507380	of Finding Nemo.
507380	512580	The Frying Nemo saga spanned eight months and four videos, the last of which represented
512580	516120	the most effort I had ever put into a video at that point.
516120	520880	There used to be this YTP forum called Youchu where I spent a lot of time lurking.
520880	524600	I tried to make an account there once, but they never sent me the email to confirm my
524600	530140	account, so I took it as a sign to forever remain a lurker, and lurk I did.
530140	535040	The day I uploaded Deep Frying Nemo, I saw an unusual amount of backlash about it on
535040	536040	Youchu.
536040	541300	Now, of course everyone is entitled to their opinions, and in hindsight, I actually agree
541300	545880	with what a lot of them have to say, but for a forum where everyone tends to act aloof
545880	550940	and disinterested, there were certainly a lot of people going out of their way to critique
550940	551940	my video.
551940	556900	It wasn't the content of the criticism that bothered me, rather the quantity of people
556900	562040	coming out of the woodwork to express their dissatisfaction with me, a guy who never posted
562040	565320	anything or interacted with anyone on the forum.
565320	567460	Why did they care so much?
567460	570680	Why did I care so much about what they had to say?
570680	579300	Why do I care so much about what this guy has to say?
579300	582280	I started making YTPs way back in 2010.
582280	586280	I was just a kid at the time, and it seemed like a fun hobby to get into.
586280	591180	At this time, I had no idea what I was doing and basically did whatever impulsively came
591180	596100	to my mind, but for some reason, a lot of people started watching my videos.
596100	602400	Early influential poopers like Barneyisperverted and linkondrugs became fans of me, a 13-year-old
602400	606480	who was still trying to figure out the basic functions of my editing software.
606480	610500	Of course, they didn't know that, nobody did, but it didn't matter because I was getting
610500	613060	moderate popularity regardless.
613060	618740	I'll always remember when one day I went from less than 10 subscribers to over 100, a measly
618740	623480	amount compared to my standards today, but at the time, I considered it my single greatest
623480	627340	accomplishment, not just in YouTube, but in life.
627340	632480	For years growing up, my YouTube channel was the one single thing I was truly proud of,
632480	637500	and YTP became one of the only defining traits of my identity, so maybe that's why I started
637500	639540	taking it so seriously.
639540	643980	Maybe serious is the wrong word, but around the time of the Pixar poops, I certainly started
643980	645100	trying harder.
645100	650240	I started making longer videos with more intensive editing, and I kept getting rewarded with
650240	652800	wild popularity in my genre.
652800	661220	But after getting so many views and subscribers, I really only cared about one thing, respect.
661220	665160	I tried to be gracious and humble in the wake of my success.
665160	669900	I hosted several collabs to try to showcase the talent of lesser-known poopers.
669900	674680	I made two videos in which I tried sharing my success with other poopers whom I thought
674680	675680	deserved it.
675680	679860	I gave over 30 shout-outs and recommendations to my newfound audience.
679860	685120	One of those shout-outs going to a guy called Stuart K. Reilly, who was perhaps my favorite
685120	686980	pooper at the time.
686980	692700	Stu was an old-school guy who was very influential in innovating the genre to a more modern style,
692700	696040	and he was one of the leading contributors to the YouTube forums.
696040	701900	But most notably, Stu was a guy who ran a series called YTP News, a series that taught
701900	705800	me more about YTP than any other source.
705800	710760	Without YTP News, it's doubtful that I'd be making any videos today.
710760	714880	I remember watching one episode where Stu spent about 16 minutes ranting about a guy
714880	721520	called Waxinator, a pooper he deemed overrated, pandering, and not representative of what
721520	723200	YTP should be.
723200	728740	And I remember thinking at the time, yeah, screw Waxinator, why does he have what other
728740	730480	people deserve?
730480	735680	Well, it turned out that a few years later, I was the new Waxinator.
735680	739200	I was the one getting called overrated and pandering.
739200	744640	Ironically, people respected me more when I had no viewers and no idea what I was doing.
744640	749760	When I started getting popular, I lost the only thing that I would end up caring about.
749760	754600	YouTube Poop originated as a way to mock and deride traditional media through remixing
754600	755700	and editing.
755700	760680	It is counterculture by its very nature, and it's always meant to rally against some kind
760680	762320	of establishment.
762320	767340	Paradoxically, popular YouTube Poopers can never be truly respected because when you
767340	771440	enter the mainstream, you become the establishment.
771440	776320	That is the main reason why I believe I became hated in the YTP community.
776320	779640	The only problem being I didn't choose to get popular.
779640	782180	YTP was always just a hobby for me.
782180	786360	For more than five years, I got millions of views and didn't make a cent of revenue off
786360	790800	of it because simply creating the videos was rewarding enough for me.
790800	795080	I didn't really care about the power or the clout or the influence because I never really
795080	798360	saw myself as an influential person.
798360	802920	I was just making funny edits for fun, and everyone else was welcome to come along for
802920	803920	the ride.
803920	808220	There was never a point when I decided to sell out and become the establishment.
808220	811520	It just sort of happened based on factors out of my control.
811520	815800	And there came a point during the production of Deepfrying Nemo when I decided that I wanted
815800	816800	to go back.
816800	822560	I wanted to return to the old days when nobody knew about me and YTP was still fun and experimental
822560	823960	and adventurous.
823960	828080	This desire is what led me to eventually create Green Simpsons.
828080	832360	And although I really had fun making it, I suspected deep down that things would never
832360	833560	be the same.
841560	843160	What, you've gotten complaints?
843160	844160	Complaints?
844160	845160	I can handle it.
845160	846160	What, you've gotten complaints?
846520	847520	I can handle it.
847520	848520	Complaints?
848520	849520	Complaints?
849520	850520	I can handle it.
850520	852720	What I can't handle is complaints.
852720	857400	The part of my audience that didn't immediately stop watching then and there started complaining
857400	862120	about the video much in the same way that Yu-Chu had done years before, and I had had
862120	863120	enough.
863120	867760	I never signed up to be lectured and ridiculed over a voluntary hobby of mine that was supposed
867760	868760	to be fun.
868760	872520	So I lashed out at them, my very own audience.
872520	877200	In my mind, they were the ones who took away my enjoyment of YTP, and they were the ones
877200	880200	who prevented me from earning the respect I deserved.
880200	884280	I was finally going to do what Hercoaster and Chemistry Guy and the Yu-Chu forums told
884280	887640	me I should have been doing and make videos that I wanted.
887640	892640	I even changed my YouTube username to signify the beginning of a new era.
892640	894280	But that didn't change anything.
894280	898820	I still saw my new videos getting backlash on Yu-Chu, and at the center of it all was
898820	901480	good ol' Stuart K. Reilly.
901480	903200	All I wanted was to help you.
903200	906560	I only wanted to help, and what did you say to me?
906560	911820	I think Lemon has been on a downward spiral mentally, and now he's lost it completely.
911820	915460	It tore me apart, but I learned an important lesson.
915460	919160	You can't count on anyone, especially your heroes.
919160	921680	I was wrong to treat you that way.
921680	922680	I'm sorry.
922680	923680	See?
923680	925880	Now you respect me, because I'm a threat.
925880	927480	I'll give them downward spiral.
927480	931240	I'll give them the most spectacular downward spiral anyone's ever seen.
932000	936640	And this, right here, was the origin of the downward spiral.
936640	940560	I had moved beyond salvaging anything on my channel at this point.
940560	945120	I had given up everything, the support of thousands of fans, to chase the respect I
945120	946120	wanted.
946120	950640	And at this moment, it dawned on me that I would never, ever get it.
950640	955180	Over the past three years, I had witnessed my fun hobby become completely soiled with
955180	958040	bitterness, resentment, and complaints.
958040	960560	So, so many complaints.
960560	963760	The only thing left for me to do was complain back.
963760	969440	And when I'm old and I've had my fun, I'll sell my spiral so that everyone can be downward.
969440	971120	Everyone can complain.
971120	982280	And when everyone's on a downward spiral, no one will be.
982280	987000	I started by publishing a 12-page document complaining about YouTubers and their mistreatment
987000	988760	of popular YouTube poopers.
988760	993640	I complained about how they had become the true establishment of the YTP community.
993640	998760	I complained about how Stuart K. Reilly ruined everything and created the downward spiral.
998760	1002340	Then I turned around to my YouTube channel and complained about politics, complained
1002340	1006560	about high school, complained about people complaining about me complaining, then complained
1006560	1010420	about people complaining about me responding to their complaints.
1010420	1014920	All this new complaining didn't leave much room for YouTube poops, and eventually I stopped
1014920	1015980	making them.
1015980	1017320	There was never a goodbye.
1017720	1019800	I never planned a finale.
1019800	1021680	Most poopers go out this way.
1021680	1025460	You never even know they're gone until you stumble upon their channel one day and they
1025460	1027680	haven't uploaded in years.
1027680	1031960	Most poopers leave gracefully and are remembered fondly, which is what this comment was alluding
1031960	1033460	to at the beginning.
1033460	1034560	Not me, though.
1034560	1038680	I was hated for leaving according to this comment, and I was hated for staying according
1038680	1039680	to this comment.
1039680	1046060	I find it rather fitting that I left YTP in the same way I entered, alone, not respected,
1046060	1047860	with nobody watching.
1047860	1051540	After more than seven years of service, that's my legacy.
1051540	1054540	I keep this comment around because it's a testament to that.
1061740	1066420	Luckily for me, I guess I was good enough at complaining to get a second chance on YouTube,
1066420	1070520	and more people watch me now than ever did when I made YTPs.
1070520	1073900	Complaining sort of replaced YTP as my new identity.
1073900	1077300	The hate never went away, and I didn't really expect it to.
1077300	1080080	I think that became part of my identity, too.
1080080	1084940	At least now I get hated for valid reasons, as opposed to not being good enough at making
1084940	1087200	goofy edits of kids' shows.
1087200	1089800	How did things get so bad between us?
1089800	1093700	This comment is just so bitter on an oddly personal level.
1093700	1099180	I know this is also the guy who ran the EL Fan YTP troll account, a channel single-handedly
1099180	1102280	dedicated to hating me for more than two years.
1102280	1106680	They finally got bored of me not responding and closed the channel at the end of last year.
1106680	1111100	Keep in mind, I have never talked to this person before in my entire life.
1111100	1115360	I think this person also started a Discord server of other YouTube poopers who hate me,
1115360	1119840	and they carried on the legacy with this imposter Vidly account that still produces content
1119840	1121020	to this day.
1121020	1124380	I haven't uploaded a YTP since 2017.
1124380	1129000	It astounds me how even today, the biggest source of bitterness and resentment towards
1129000	1135340	me comes, still, from the YTP community, a group of people who supposedly makes comedy
1135340	1137120	videos for fun.
1137120	1142120	I tweeted this out as a reply to DaThings, a YouTube pooper who publicly chastised me
1142120	1144080	for making an edgy joke.
1144080	1145800	He later apologized.
1145800	1150360	Other YouTube poopers like Attack of the Hank and Good Ol' Stu still take jabs at me despite
1150360	1155560	us having absolutely no connection other than a loose genre video we used to make.
1155560	1157280	I don't need anyone's apology.
1157280	1158640	I don't need anyone's sympathy.
1158640	1160280	I'm not a victim here.
1160280	1164960	But if you can find any former YouTube pooper out there who gets repeatedly hated as much
1164960	1167880	as I do, I'd be happy to hear about them.
1167880	1170520	I understand that I bring a lot of it on myself.
1170520	1173720	I definitely regret a lot of the stuff I said in the past.
1173720	1178440	I started a whole melodramatic thread after this demanding an explanation from the YTP
1178440	1182560	community, and like I said at the beginning of this video, no one was able to give me
1182560	1184720	a comprehensive explanation.
1184720	1189280	So the best I can still do is speculate.
1189280	1194080	A lot of people ask me why I make this issue about the YTP community as a whole.
1194080	1198120	I don't really even know how to define the YTP community anymore.
1198120	1202640	It doesn't mean YouTube because the site shut down last year long after I and a lot of other
1202640	1204500	people stopped caring about it.
1204500	1208880	What remains of the community has either moved on to new frontiers or spread themselves out
1208880	1211380	among a dozen or so micro communities.
1211380	1214460	I guess I've always felt it's been me against everyone else.
1214460	1218680	And even when it ain't so, I have a knack of running my mouth and turning the community
1218680	1220500	against me regardless.
1220500	1224620	Here I am making a video about it, making the problem exponentially worse.
1224620	1227860	Don't try to go hunt down any of the people in this video, by the way.
1227860	1229520	This isn't about the people.
1229520	1231760	I only care about the ideas.
1231760	1235840	Maybe the reason I care so much about this is that I'm trying my hardest to justify the
1235840	1239560	purpose of the first five and a half years I spent on this website.
1239560	1244000	I mean, yeah, I used the skills and audience I gained during the YouTube poop era to transition
1244000	1245740	to greener pastures today.
1245740	1249980	I learned from my mistakes in the past and I worked towards not repeating them.
1249980	1252480	And now I'm doing the best I've ever been on YouTube.
1252480	1256860	Ironically, I became more respected by the greater YouTube community than I ever was
1256860	1258720	by the YTP community.
1258720	1260900	EmperorLemon posted this on Twitter.
1260900	1263960	It raises the question of why I didn't leave sooner.
1263960	1267240	I don't necessarily think it's fair to throw out a bunch of what ifs.
1267240	1271920	I think I am where I am today because of the very specific chain of events that preceded it.
1271920	1275820	I certainly don't think I would be nearly as successful if it weren't for my experiences
1275820	1279140	making YouTube poops, both positive and negative.
1279140	1284300	However, I'd like to think it mattered more than just a simple stepping stone to the next frontier.
1284300	1288100	I'd like to believe the whole thing wasn't just a big waste of time.
1288100	1292380	I will say that if I had never had a major breakthrough while making YouTube poops, I
1292380	1295000	would almost certainly have quit YouTube by now.
1295000	1299120	I have an alt account called EmperorLime where I upload 30-second long shitposts a
1299120	1302460	few times a year that only get a few thousand views each.
1302460	1307480	I imagine that's what my channel would be today if I never got popular through YTPs.
1307480	1311420	And I'd probably be making a living doing some boring engineering shit.
1311420	1315760	I guess all the videos you see on my channel today are only possible because of my struggles
1315760	1317340	in YTP.
1317340	1320580	For what it's worth, that's something.
1320580	1324300	I don't know how many more years it'll be before the community can just let me ride
1324300	1326200	off into the sunset.
1326200	1330320	I've cried and whined and bitched about sour grapes for long enough.
1330320	1334120	The best outcome I can hope for at this point is for everyone to just forget about me and
1334120	1335860	leave me to my own accord.
1335860	1340060	I'm sure this video won't be doing me any favors there, but at least the few of you
1340060	1344760	out there who actually care about any of this can hear my side of the story.
1344760	1348740	Maybe this whole time it's been my fault for expecting everyone to reach out to me when
1348740	1352420	all along I should have been the one making an effort to reach out to them.
1352420	1358400	So I did a little digging and found the guy who commented this, and I reached out to him.
1358400	1362920	It turns out he doesn't feel the same way anymore, and he actually regrets how he acted.
1362920	1366660	He apologized to me multiple times, and I accepted it.
1366660	1369380	So then, was this video completely pointless?
1369380	1373700	A shameless, petty expose on some guy's hate comment that doesn't even reflect his
1373700	1374820	current views?
1374820	1376800	Well, not entirely.
1376800	1380400	You know, it's not often that you get to have an honest, relaxed conversation with
1380400	1382240	one of your biggest haters.
1382240	1388580	So I asked him why I was so hated, and for the first time ever, I got a satisfying answer.
1388580	1391040	I guess that's all I really wanted at this point.
1391040	1393760	We ended the conversation on good terms.
1393760	1397480	It just goes to show that if you play your cards right, you can win over even your most
1397480	1398980	passionate haters.
1398980	1404020	I just wish I had realized that a little sooner.
1404020	1407880	Will Emperor Lemon ever poop again?
1407880	1409420	Most likely not.
1409420	1413180	It amazes me that there are some people out there in my audience still anticipating a
1413180	1414180	new YTP.
1414180	1418780	I've certainly thought about it before, even thrown around a few ideas in editing
1418780	1423860	software, but every time I try, I just don't have the motivation to continue.
1423860	1427060	YTP just isn't fun for me anymore.
1427060	1428700	I mean, just look at this video.
1428700	1433460	I've been talking about YouTube poop for about half an hour, and I don't think I've
1433460	1434580	told a single joke.
1434580	1438660	It's like I can't even have fun talking about this stuff anymore.
1439340	1444860	The only thing that's for sure about him, Lemon, is nothings for sure.
1449860	1454860	I'm on to the next adventure now, where once again, I'm just a new guy with everything
1454860	1456020	to prove.
1456020	1461140	So if you take one thing away from this video, it's that hate is temporary, but YouTube
1461140	1462780	comments are forever.
1468660	1485760	You know, making this video really took me back to the beginning of the downward spiral,
1485760	1494140	the summer of 2016, a simpler time of YouTube drama, fine compilations, and Harambe, and
1494140	1498860	a time when I was very uncertain about the future of this YouTube channel.
1498860	1502300	I was starting my first semester of college, and I was really struggling to figure out
1502300	1504740	what to do on YouTube anymore.
1504740	1509180	I had over 100,000 subscribers at this time, but most of them had stopped watching, and
1509180	1512100	I was losing subscribers with every upload.
1512100	1516500	They had stopped caring, I had stopped caring, and with each video, I was finding less and
1516500	1518640	less motivation to continue.
1518640	1524640	There came a time when I contemplated abandoning this channel entirely to focus on, gasp, a
1524640	1525800	real job.
1525800	1529420	But then sometime during my first semester of college, I hit a really rough patch in
1529420	1534000	my life, and I said to myself, you know what, I'm probably never going to get another chance
1534000	1537560	at this YouTube thing, so here's what I'm going to do, I'm going to spend the next few
1537560	1541720	years putting in the effort to make my YouTube channel great again.
1541720	1547000	And by the time I graduate, I'd be able to decide if it was worth it to continue.
1547280	1551960	Well, I should be graduating at the end of this year, and I have to say, I'm making enough
1551960	1556360	now where the full-time YouTube dream just might be feasible.
1556360	1560100	And this is due in large part to the wonderful sponsors I've been able to pick up over the
1560100	1561160	past year.
1561160	1564120	Which brings me to the sponsor for today's video.
1569120	1572880	Zelda, my Minecraft account has been hacked by the evil forces of Ganon.
1572960	1577320	I'm going to log into my recovery email to get my account back.
1577320	1580400	But Father, what if you forgot your recovery password?
1580400	1581400	Oh, shit.
1581400	1586400	Gee, I just wonder if there's an affordable online service that could have easily solved
1586400	1589200	both of these problems.
1589200	1591480	This video is brought to you by Dashlane.
1591480	1595540	If this video taught you anything, it's that I tend to make a lot of enemies online.
1595540	1601040	And if you have a lot of enemies, it's probably a good idea to invest in some security.
1601040	1602680	Password security.
1602680	1605440	Dashlane is not just a password protection manager.
1605440	1607960	It's also downward spiral insurance.
1607960	1611960	One of the fastest ways of falling into the downward spiral is having your accounts hacked
1611960	1617560	and seized by some dude you trolled on a message board years ago, all because you thought Password
1617560	1618560	1 was secure.
1618560	1621560	That's the stupidest combination I've ever heard in my life!
1621560	1625160	Oh, you stupid son of a...
1625160	1629160	Stop worrying about passwords and let Dashlane do it for you.

1635720	1636720	Forgetting your password?

1641160	1642160	remember.

1675400	1682080	You see, last summer I began the era of my YouTube life cycle that you all know was the
1682080	1683080	downward spiral.
1683080	1687800	And every step of the way I have faced resistance, backlash, and naysayers.
1687800	1690400	Everyone thought they knew what was good for my channel.
1690400	1692400	Nobody understood the downward spiral.
1692400	1694000	And everybody questioned it.
1694000	1698520	You all questioned me, you all questioned my motives, you all questioned my goals.
1698520	1702760	But most importantly, you questioned why the Simpsons were green.
1702760	1707560	All I wanted to do was make green Simpsons videos for you people that'll ruin it by complaining.
1707560	1708560	So you know what?
1708560	1710560	No, I've become the one who complains.
1710560	1712280	I complain here, I complain there.
1712280	1713280	I complain everywhere.
1713280	1715280	All I ever do is complain.
1715280	1718280	I complain about frying Dory, and you complain back.
1718280	1719280	So I complained even harder.
1719280	1723280	And now frying Dory is an afterthought, just as it should have been all along.
1723280	1726280	And it's funny to me, because you all considered me an afterthought.
1726280	1727280	You all wrote me off.
1727280	1729280	You all left this channel for dead.
1729280	1731280	You put me on the downward spiral.
1731280	1732280	So you know what I did?
1732280	1733280	I wrote that shit.
1733280	1736280	I took the ball you people gave me and fucking ran with it.
1736280	1739280	Because when you're in a downward spiral, there's no escaping it.
1739280	1741280	So you might as well aim for the bottom.
