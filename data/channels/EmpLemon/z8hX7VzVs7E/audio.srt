00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:16,700
Welcome everyone to a new series that I call Frying Comments.

2
00:00:16,700 --> 00:00:21,360
Now some of my older viewers will remember that years ago I made a few videos thumping

3
00:00:21,360 --> 00:00:29,440
some hapless goobers in my comment section.

4
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:33,200
And needless to say, this video is not that.

5
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:38,320
All of you have probably seen your fair share of comment response videos on YouTube where

6
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:44,000
big and proud YouTubers sarcastically mock the utter peons beneath them as the slime

7
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,800
between their toes.

8
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:47,520
This video is not that.

9
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:51,640
Oh no, I'm not flying over anyone's heads here.

10
00:00:51,640 --> 00:00:55,960
All of you who watch me know that my spiral only points in one direction.

11
00:00:55,960 --> 00:01:00,720
And that's down, down, down, which is exactly where I'm going today.

12
00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:05,640
Because in this series, we're not dealing with your average, everyday criticism.

13
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:09,040
This is advanced criticism.

14
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:13,640
Today we are sinking to depths that no channel of my size should ever reach.

15
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:17,760
We are reaching levels of pettiness that shouldn't even be possible.

16
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:22,960
Today we aren't just glazing over an eclectic compilation of posts as you may expect from

17
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:24,240
a video like this.

18
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:30,760
Rather, we are going to examine just a single comment, posted over a year ago, that nobody

19
00:01:30,760 --> 00:01:32,440
cares about.

20
00:01:32,440 --> 00:01:44,960
Nobody besides me.

21
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:50,080
Lol you're hopping onto whatever bandwagon you can to try and get as many views as possible

22
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:52,040
and spread your unfunny shit.

23
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:55,240
It's a shame your fanbase can't see past this.

24
00:01:55,240 --> 00:02:00,440
The commenter here assumes that I'm trend-hopping based on my video's trendy subject matter.

25
00:02:00,440 --> 00:02:04,500
While I would disagree with this claim, the important aspect here is what would lead someone

26
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:06,040
to make this claim.

27
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:11,040
Looking at my channel now, seeing me make videos about Dale Earnhardt, court cases,

28
00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:15,040
and Leafy more than a year after people stopped watching him, it's pretty obvious that I'm

29
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:17,320
not quite the trendiest YouTube channel.

30
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:22,000
But at the time this comment was posted, this was actually a much more reasonable claim,

31
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,960
considering the era that preceded it.

32
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:27,760
Those of you who are new to the channel may not actually know this, but I used to make

33
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:29,700
YouTube poops.

34
00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:35,320
For the first five years of this channel, all I did was make YouTube poops, a time period

35
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:38,880
which constitutes the primary focus of this video.

36
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:40,640
Let's find out why.

37
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:45,780
The YTP community has seen so many amazing and talented people leave the community or

38
00:02:45,780 --> 00:02:49,760
simply stop making videos for various reasons.

39
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:55,680
Why the fuck are we stuck with you?

40
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:59,580
I've never really had a good relationship with the YTP community.

41
00:02:59,580 --> 00:03:02,360
For the longest time, I was totally isolated.

42
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:03,960
I never talked to anybody.

43
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:06,080
All I really did was watch and listen.

44
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:10,560
I can't really say for sure what exactly I did to get on people's nerves, but I can

45
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:12,820
make an educated guess.

46
00:03:12,820 --> 00:03:18,000
Now the idea of drama in the YTP community may seem shocking and counterintuitive to

47
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:27,960
many of you, but believe me, it exists.

48
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:32,120
How could such silly videos lead to such bitterness and resentment?

49
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:33,800
I can't really explain it.

50
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:37,680
I guess it's like any other online community where some people are loved and some people

51
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:42,920
are hated, and more often than not, I tend to fall on the side of the hated.

52
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:44,800
Maybe it's because I didn't talk enough.

53
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:47,080
Maybe it's because I talked too much.

54
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:52,260
No one has ever given me a comprehensive explanation, so the best I can do is speculate.

55
00:03:52,260 --> 00:03:55,120
That's all I've been able to do for all this time.

56
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:57,940
Maybe this comment can lead me to some answers.

57
00:03:57,940 --> 00:04:02,780
Your fans are a bunch of easily amused fucking idiots who find shitty content creators like

58
00:04:02,780 --> 00:04:04,120
you entertaining.

59
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:08,740
The only reason you even had a large number of subs in the first place is because of those

60
00:04:08,740 --> 00:04:13,560
Pixar YTPs you made, which were pretty fucking shit to begin with.

61
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:17,720
Your actual non-Pixar content wasn't earning you many subs.

62
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:19,880
The sentiment here is pretty clear.

63
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:24,840
My YTPs are more popular than they deserve to be, and I don't necessarily disagree

64
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:26,000
with that.

65
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:32,280
In mid-2013, I had less than 4,000 subscribers, and then I uploaded The Uncredibles, a video

66
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:34,160
that changed everything.

67
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:39,060
It was my first video to reach a million views, and the popularity of this video carried over

68
00:04:39,060 --> 00:04:44,180
to six of my next YTPs, which would also pass a million views.

69
00:04:44,180 --> 00:04:49,220
To this day, nearly six years later, more people have watched The Uncredibles than any

70
00:04:49,220 --> 00:04:51,080
other video on my channel.

71
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:54,780
So did I make these videos with the intent of getting popular on YouTube?

72
00:04:54,780 --> 00:04:58,400
Well, no, but I can understand why people may think that.

73
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:04,660
The source material is very common and accessible, consisting of SpongeBob and Pixar movies,

74
00:05:04,660 --> 00:05:09,340
which contrasts heavily with the more obscure sources of older YTPs.

75
00:05:09,340 --> 00:05:13,380
Looking at this aspect, one could infer that I specifically chose these sources with the

76
00:05:13,380 --> 00:05:15,740
intent of getting lots of views.

77
00:05:15,740 --> 00:05:19,720
In reality, The Uncredibles was only just supposed to be the next video in line and

78
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:20,840
nothing else.

79
00:05:20,840 --> 00:05:25,440
The fact that it, among these other videos, got so popular had to do more with the audience

80
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:29,540
selectively preferring the source material because it was so accessible.

81
00:05:29,540 --> 00:05:33,380
The reason I chose these sources in the first place was because I watched them a lot as

82
00:05:33,380 --> 00:05:38,540
a kid and I wanted to remix them, not because I wanted more people to watch them.

83
00:05:38,540 --> 00:05:43,000
A lot of people also seemed to miss that during this time, I didn't exclusively upload what

84
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:48,780
you'd call trendy sources, and consequently, those videos received far less views.

85
00:05:48,780 --> 00:05:51,440
None of this was ever by design on my end.

86
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:55,680
To put it simply, if I was in the business of getting views, I probably wouldn't have

87
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:59,140
spent five straight years making YouTube poops.

88
00:05:59,140 --> 00:06:03,780
In the vast majority of cases, YTPs don't get many views.

89
00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:09,340
So when my YTPs all of a sudden started getting many, many views, I and a lot of other people

90
00:06:09,340 --> 00:06:10,860
didn't know how to react.

91
00:06:10,860 --> 00:06:17,220
I started 2013 getting a few thousand views on my videos and I ended 2014 getting millions.

92
00:06:17,220 --> 00:06:20,620
Did my videos get a thousand percent more entertaining?

93
00:06:20,620 --> 00:06:23,340
Was I putting in a thousand percent more effort?

94
00:06:23,340 --> 00:06:25,020
No, obviously not.

95
00:06:25,020 --> 00:06:29,340
Personally, I thought I was making them about the same as all my older videos, but with

96
00:06:29,340 --> 00:06:34,540
that being said, my sudden meteoric rise in popularity was met with skepticism by a lot

97
00:06:34,540 --> 00:06:39,100
of people in the YTP community, and a lot of people were beginning to sense a great

98
00:06:39,100 --> 00:06:43,620
inequity between the views I got and the views they thought I deserved.

99
00:06:43,620 --> 00:06:48,900
I began to notice it sometime in the spring of 2014 after uploading my second Incredibles

100
00:06:48,900 --> 00:06:50,980
video, The Non-Credibles.

101
00:06:50,980 --> 00:06:55,300
On this video, I received comments from two other well-known YouTube poopers, Hurricoaster

102
00:06:55,300 --> 00:06:56,780
and Chemistry Guy.

103
00:06:56,780 --> 00:07:01,520
I remember both of these comments offering some shockingly blunt criticism of what they

104
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:07,260
perceived as a change in my style, each delivered with the implication that I had sold out to

105
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:09,360
a more mainstream audience.

106
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:12,180
At the time, I found these comments very discouraging.

107
00:07:12,180 --> 00:07:18,220
How these two poopers whom I admired and respected were utterly disappointed in how I had changed.

108
00:07:18,260 --> 00:07:21,140
The problem was that I didn't think I had changed.

109
00:07:21,140 --> 00:07:25,680
I figured my process with this video had been the same as it was years ago when I had made

110
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:28,020
videos that they supposedly enjoyed.

111
00:07:28,020 --> 00:07:33,900
The only real difference in my mind was that now I was popular, while then I was a nobody.

112
00:07:33,900 --> 00:07:39,040
Clearly, the notion that these guys were disappointed implies that at one time they had high expectations

113
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:43,480
of me, and the fact that they decided to critique me directly indicates that they only had my

114
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:44,860
best interests in mind.

115
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:49,380
I still respect both of these guys, and both of them still leave comments on my stuff every

116
00:07:49,380 --> 00:07:54,880
now and then, but these two comments left on this video really bothered me, mostly because

117
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:58,320
I could never reconcile their newfound perception of me.

118
00:07:58,320 --> 00:08:02,340
Over time, I could really only conclude that they disliked my videos because they were

119
00:08:02,340 --> 00:08:07,380
popular, and I reinforced this idea about a year later in the spring of 2015.

120
00:08:14,860 --> 00:08:25,700
I had uploaded Deep Frying Nemo, the final installment of my quest to remix the entirety

121
00:08:25,700 --> 00:08:27,380
of Finding Nemo.

122
00:08:27,380 --> 00:08:32,580
The Frying Nemo saga spanned eight months and four videos, the last of which represented

123
00:08:32,580 --> 00:08:36,120
the most effort I had ever put into a video at that point.

124
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:40,880
There used to be this YTP forum called Youchu where I spent a lot of time lurking.

125
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:44,600
I tried to make an account there once, but they never sent me the email to confirm my

126
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:50,140
account, so I took it as a sign to forever remain a lurker, and lurk I did.

127
00:08:50,140 --> 00:08:55,040
The day I uploaded Deep Frying Nemo, I saw an unusual amount of backlash about it on

128
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:56,040
Youchu.

129
00:08:56,040 --> 00:09:01,300
Now, of course everyone is entitled to their opinions, and in hindsight, I actually agree

130
00:09:01,300 --> 00:09:05,880
with what a lot of them have to say, but for a forum where everyone tends to act aloof

131
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:10,940
and disinterested, there were certainly a lot of people going out of their way to critique

132
00:09:10,940 --> 00:09:11,940
my video.

133
00:09:11,940 --> 00:09:16,900
It wasn't the content of the criticism that bothered me, rather the quantity of people

134
00:09:16,900 --> 00:09:22,040
coming out of the woodwork to express their dissatisfaction with me, a guy who never posted

135
00:09:22,040 --> 00:09:25,320
anything or interacted with anyone on the forum.

136
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:27,460
Why did they care so much?

137
00:09:27,460 --> 00:09:30,680
Why did I care so much about what they had to say?

138
00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:39,300
Why do I care so much about what this guy has to say?

139
00:09:39,300 --> 00:09:42,280
I started making YTPs way back in 2010.

140
00:09:42,280 --> 00:09:46,280
I was just a kid at the time, and it seemed like a fun hobby to get into.

141
00:09:46,280 --> 00:09:51,180
At this time, I had no idea what I was doing and basically did whatever impulsively came

142
00:09:51,180 --> 00:09:56,100
to my mind, but for some reason, a lot of people started watching my videos.

143
00:09:56,100 --> 00:10:02,400
Early influential poopers like Barneyisperverted and linkondrugs became fans of me, a 13-year-old

144
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:06,480
who was still trying to figure out the basic functions of my editing software.

145
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:10,500
Of course, they didn't know that, nobody did, but it didn't matter because I was getting

146
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:13,060
moderate popularity regardless.

147
00:10:13,060 --> 00:10:18,740
I'll always remember when one day I went from less than 10 subscribers to over 100, a measly

148
00:10:18,740 --> 00:10:23,480
amount compared to my standards today, but at the time, I considered it my single greatest

149
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:27,340
accomplishment, not just in YouTube, but in life.

150
00:10:27,340 --> 00:10:32,480
For years growing up, my YouTube channel was the one single thing I was truly proud of,

151
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:37,500
and YTP became one of the only defining traits of my identity, so maybe that's why I started

152
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:39,540
taking it so seriously.

153
00:10:39,540 --> 00:10:43,980
Maybe serious is the wrong word, but around the time of the Pixar poops, I certainly started

154
00:10:43,980 --> 00:10:45,100
trying harder.

155
00:10:45,100 --> 00:10:50,240
I started making longer videos with more intensive editing, and I kept getting rewarded with

156
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:52,800
wild popularity in my genre.

157
00:10:52,800 --> 00:11:01,220
But after getting so many views and subscribers, I really only cared about one thing, respect.

158
00:11:01,220 --> 00:11:05,160
I tried to be gracious and humble in the wake of my success.

159
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:09,900
I hosted several collabs to try to showcase the talent of lesser-known poopers.

160
00:11:09,900 --> 00:11:14,680
I made two videos in which I tried sharing my success with other poopers whom I thought

161
00:11:14,680 --> 00:11:15,680
deserved it.

162
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:19,860
I gave over 30 shout-outs and recommendations to my newfound audience.

163
00:11:19,860 --> 00:11:25,120
One of those shout-outs going to a guy called Stuart K. Reilly, who was perhaps my favorite

164
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:26,980
pooper at the time.

165
00:11:26,980 --> 00:11:32,700
Stu was an old-school guy who was very influential in innovating the genre to a more modern style,

166
00:11:32,700 --> 00:11:36,040
and he was one of the leading contributors to the YouTube forums.

167
00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:41,900
But most notably, Stu was a guy who ran a series called YTP News, a series that taught

168
00:11:41,900 --> 00:11:45,800
me more about YTP than any other source.

169
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:50,760
Without YTP News, it's doubtful that I'd be making any videos today.

170
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:54,880
I remember watching one episode where Stu spent about 16 minutes ranting about a guy

171
00:11:54,880 --> 00:12:01,520
called Waxinator, a pooper he deemed overrated, pandering, and not representative of what

172
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:03,200
YTP should be.

173
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:08,740
And I remember thinking at the time, yeah, screw Waxinator, why does he have what other

174
00:12:08,740 --> 00:12:10,480
people deserve?

175
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:15,680
Well, it turned out that a few years later, I was the new Waxinator.

176
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:19,200
I was the one getting called overrated and pandering.

177
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:24,640
Ironically, people respected me more when I had no viewers and no idea what I was doing.

178
00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:29,760
When I started getting popular, I lost the only thing that I would end up caring about.

179
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:34,600
YouTube Poop originated as a way to mock and deride traditional media through remixing

180
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:35,700
and editing.

181
00:12:35,700 --> 00:12:40,680
It is counterculture by its very nature, and it's always meant to rally against some kind

182
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:42,320
of establishment.

183
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:47,340
Paradoxically, popular YouTube Poopers can never be truly respected because when you

184
00:12:47,340 --> 00:12:51,440
enter the mainstream, you become the establishment.

185
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:56,320
That is the main reason why I believe I became hated in the YTP community.

186
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:59,640
The only problem being I didn't choose to get popular.

187
00:12:59,640 --> 00:13:02,180
YTP was always just a hobby for me.

188
00:13:02,180 --> 00:13:06,360
For more than five years, I got millions of views and didn't make a cent of revenue off

189
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:10,800
of it because simply creating the videos was rewarding enough for me.

190
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:15,080
I didn't really care about the power or the clout or the influence because I never really

191
00:13:15,080 --> 00:13:18,360
saw myself as an influential person.

192
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:22,920
I was just making funny edits for fun, and everyone else was welcome to come along for

193
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:23,920
the ride.

194
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:28,220
There was never a point when I decided to sell out and become the establishment.

195
00:13:28,220 --> 00:13:31,520
It just sort of happened based on factors out of my control.

196
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:35,800
And there came a point during the production of Deepfrying Nemo when I decided that I wanted

197
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:36,800
to go back.

198
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:42,560
I wanted to return to the old days when nobody knew about me and YTP was still fun and experimental

199
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:43,960
and adventurous.

200
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:48,080
This desire is what led me to eventually create Green Simpsons.

201
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:52,360
And although I really had fun making it, I suspected deep down that things would never

202
00:13:52,360 --> 00:13:53,560
be the same.

203
00:14:01,560 --> 00:14:03,160
What, you've gotten complaints?

204
00:14:03,160 --> 00:14:04,160
Complaints?

205
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:05,160
I can handle it.

206
00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:06,160
What, you've gotten complaints?

207
00:14:06,520 --> 00:14:07,520
I can handle it.

208
00:14:07,520 --> 00:14:08,520
Complaints?

209
00:14:08,520 --> 00:14:09,520
Complaints?

210
00:14:09,520 --> 00:14:10,520
I can handle it.

211
00:14:10,520 --> 00:14:12,720
What I can't handle is complaints.

212
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:17,400
The part of my audience that didn't immediately stop watching then and there started complaining

213
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:22,120
about the video much in the same way that Yu-Chu had done years before, and I had had

214
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:23,120
enough.

215
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:27,760
I never signed up to be lectured and ridiculed over a voluntary hobby of mine that was supposed

216
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:28,760
to be fun.

217
00:14:28,760 --> 00:14:32,520
So I lashed out at them, my very own audience.

218
00:14:32,520 --> 00:14:37,200
In my mind, they were the ones who took away my enjoyment of YTP, and they were the ones

219
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:40,200
who prevented me from earning the respect I deserved.

220
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:44,280
I was finally going to do what Hercoaster and Chemistry Guy and the Yu-Chu forums told

221
00:14:44,280 --> 00:14:47,640
me I should have been doing and make videos that I wanted.

222
00:14:47,640 --> 00:14:52,640
I even changed my YouTube username to signify the beginning of a new era.

223
00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:54,280
But that didn't change anything.

224
00:14:54,280 --> 00:14:58,820
I still saw my new videos getting backlash on Yu-Chu, and at the center of it all was

225
00:14:58,820 --> 00:15:01,480
good ol' Stuart K. Reilly.

226
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:03,200
All I wanted was to help you.

227
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:06,560
I only wanted to help, and what did you say to me?

228
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:11,820
I think Lemon has been on a downward spiral mentally, and now he's lost it completely.

229
00:15:11,820 --> 00:15:15,460
It tore me apart, but I learned an important lesson.

230
00:15:15,460 --> 00:15:19,160
You can't count on anyone, especially your heroes.

231
00:15:19,160 --> 00:15:21,680
I was wrong to treat you that way.

232
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:22,680
I'm sorry.

233
00:15:22,680 --> 00:15:23,680
See?

234
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:25,880
Now you respect me, because I'm a threat.

235
00:15:25,880 --> 00:15:27,480
I'll give them downward spiral.

236
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:31,240
I'll give them the most spectacular downward spiral anyone's ever seen.

237
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:36,640
And this, right here, was the origin of the downward spiral.

238
00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:40,560
I had moved beyond salvaging anything on my channel at this point.

239
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:45,120
I had given up everything, the support of thousands of fans, to chase the respect I

240
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:46,120
wanted.

241
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:50,640
And at this moment, it dawned on me that I would never, ever get it.

242
00:15:50,640 --> 00:15:55,180
Over the past three years, I had witnessed my fun hobby become completely soiled with

243
00:15:55,180 --> 00:15:58,040
bitterness, resentment, and complaints.

244
00:15:58,040 --> 00:16:00,560
So, so many complaints.

245
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:03,760
The only thing left for me to do was complain back.

246
00:16:03,760 --> 00:16:09,440
And when I'm old and I've had my fun, I'll sell my spiral so that everyone can be downward.

247
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:11,120
Everyone can complain.

248
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:22,280
And when everyone's on a downward spiral, no one will be.

249
00:16:22,280 --> 00:16:27,000
I started by publishing a 12-page document complaining about YouTubers and their mistreatment

250
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,760
of popular YouTube poopers.

251
00:16:28,760 --> 00:16:33,640
I complained about how they had become the true establishment of the YTP community.

252
00:16:33,640 --> 00:16:38,760
I complained about how Stuart K. Reilly ruined everything and created the downward spiral.

253
00:16:38,760 --> 00:16:42,340
Then I turned around to my YouTube channel and complained about politics, complained

254
00:16:42,340 --> 00:16:46,560
about high school, complained about people complaining about me complaining, then complained

255
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:50,420
about people complaining about me responding to their complaints.

256
00:16:50,420 --> 00:16:54,920
All this new complaining didn't leave much room for YouTube poops, and eventually I stopped

257
00:16:54,920 --> 00:16:55,980
making them.

258
00:16:55,980 --> 00:16:57,320
There was never a goodbye.

259
00:16:57,720 --> 00:16:59,800
I never planned a finale.

260
00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:01,680
Most poopers go out this way.

261
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:05,460
You never even know they're gone until you stumble upon their channel one day and they

262
00:17:05,460 --> 00:17:07,680
haven't uploaded in years.

263
00:17:07,680 --> 00:17:11,960
Most poopers leave gracefully and are remembered fondly, which is what this comment was alluding

264
00:17:11,960 --> 00:17:13,460
to at the beginning.

265
00:17:13,460 --> 00:17:14,560
Not me, though.

266
00:17:14,560 --> 00:17:18,680
I was hated for leaving according to this comment, and I was hated for staying according

267
00:17:18,680 --> 00:17:19,680
to this comment.

268
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:26,060
I find it rather fitting that I left YTP in the same way I entered, alone, not respected,

269
00:17:26,060 --> 00:17:27,860
with nobody watching.

270
00:17:27,860 --> 00:17:31,540
After more than seven years of service, that's my legacy.

271
00:17:31,540 --> 00:17:34,540
I keep this comment around because it's a testament to that.

272
00:17:41,740 --> 00:17:46,420
Luckily for me, I guess I was good enough at complaining to get a second chance on YouTube,

273
00:17:46,420 --> 00:17:50,520
and more people watch me now than ever did when I made YTPs.

274
00:17:50,520 --> 00:17:53,900
Complaining sort of replaced YTP as my new identity.

275
00:17:53,900 --> 00:17:57,300
The hate never went away, and I didn't really expect it to.

276
00:17:57,300 --> 00:18:00,080
I think that became part of my identity, too.

277
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:04,940
At least now I get hated for valid reasons, as opposed to not being good enough at making

278
00:18:04,940 --> 00:18:07,200
goofy edits of kids' shows.

279
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:09,800
How did things get so bad between us?

280
00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:13,700
This comment is just so bitter on an oddly personal level.

281
00:18:13,700 --> 00:18:19,180
I know this is also the guy who ran the EL Fan YTP troll account, a channel single-handedly

282
00:18:19,180 --> 00:18:22,280
dedicated to hating me for more than two years.

283
00:18:22,280 --> 00:18:26,680
They finally got bored of me not responding and closed the channel at the end of last year.

284
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:31,100
Keep in mind, I have never talked to this person before in my entire life.

285
00:18:31,100 --> 00:18:35,360
I think this person also started a Discord server of other YouTube poopers who hate me,

286
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:39,840
and they carried on the legacy with this imposter Vidly account that still produces content

287
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:41,020
to this day.

288
00:18:41,020 --> 00:18:44,380
I haven't uploaded a YTP since 2017.

289
00:18:44,380 --> 00:18:49,000
It astounds me how even today, the biggest source of bitterness and resentment towards

290
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:55,340
me comes, still, from the YTP community, a group of people who supposedly makes comedy

291
00:18:55,340 --> 00:18:57,120
videos for fun.

292
00:18:57,120 --> 00:19:02,120
I tweeted this out as a reply to DaThings, a YouTube pooper who publicly chastised me

293
00:19:02,120 --> 00:19:04,080
for making an edgy joke.

294
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:05,800
He later apologized.

295
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:10,360
Other YouTube poopers like Attack of the Hank and Good Ol' Stu still take jabs at me despite

296
00:19:10,360 --> 00:19:15,560
us having absolutely no connection other than a loose genre video we used to make.

297
00:19:15,560 --> 00:19:17,280
I don't need anyone's apology.

298
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:18,640
I don't need anyone's sympathy.

299
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:20,280
I'm not a victim here.

300
00:19:20,280 --> 00:19:24,960
But if you can find any former YouTube pooper out there who gets repeatedly hated as much

301
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:27,880
as I do, I'd be happy to hear about them.

302
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:30,520
I understand that I bring a lot of it on myself.

303
00:19:30,520 --> 00:19:33,720
I definitely regret a lot of the stuff I said in the past.

304
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:38,440
I started a whole melodramatic thread after this demanding an explanation from the YTP

305
00:19:38,440 --> 00:19:42,560
community, and like I said at the beginning of this video, no one was able to give me

306
00:19:42,560 --> 00:19:44,720
a comprehensive explanation.

307
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:49,280
So the best I can still do is speculate.

308
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:54,080
A lot of people ask me why I make this issue about the YTP community as a whole.

309
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:58,120
I don't really even know how to define the YTP community anymore.

310
00:19:58,120 --> 00:20:02,640
It doesn't mean YouTube because the site shut down last year long after I and a lot of other

311
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:04,500
people stopped caring about it.

312
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:08,880
What remains of the community has either moved on to new frontiers or spread themselves out

313
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:11,380
among a dozen or so micro communities.

314
00:20:11,380 --> 00:20:14,460
I guess I've always felt it's been me against everyone else.

315
00:20:14,460 --> 00:20:18,680
And even when it ain't so, I have a knack of running my mouth and turning the community

316
00:20:18,680 --> 00:20:20,500
against me regardless.

317
00:20:20,500 --> 00:20:24,620
Here I am making a video about it, making the problem exponentially worse.

318
00:20:24,620 --> 00:20:27,860
Don't try to go hunt down any of the people in this video, by the way.

319
00:20:27,860 --> 00:20:29,520
This isn't about the people.

320
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:31,760
I only care about the ideas.

321
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:35,840
Maybe the reason I care so much about this is that I'm trying my hardest to justify the

322
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:39,560
purpose of the first five and a half years I spent on this website.

323
00:20:39,560 --> 00:20:44,000
I mean, yeah, I used the skills and audience I gained during the YouTube poop era to transition

324
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,740
to greener pastures today.

325
00:20:45,740 --> 00:20:49,980
I learned from my mistakes in the past and I worked towards not repeating them.

326
00:20:49,980 --> 00:20:52,480
And now I'm doing the best I've ever been on YouTube.

327
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:56,860
Ironically, I became more respected by the greater YouTube community than I ever was

328
00:20:56,860 --> 00:20:58,720
by the YTP community.

329
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:00,900
EmperorLemon posted this on Twitter.

330
00:21:00,900 --> 00:21:03,960
It raises the question of why I didn't leave sooner.

331
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:07,240
I don't necessarily think it's fair to throw out a bunch of what ifs.

332
00:21:07,240 --> 00:21:11,920
I think I am where I am today because of the very specific chain of events that preceded it.

333
00:21:11,920 --> 00:21:15,820
I certainly don't think I would be nearly as successful if it weren't for my experiences

334
00:21:15,820 --> 00:21:19,140
making YouTube poops, both positive and negative.

335
00:21:19,140 --> 00:21:24,300
However, I'd like to think it mattered more than just a simple stepping stone to the next frontier.

336
00:21:24,300 --> 00:21:28,100
I'd like to believe the whole thing wasn't just a big waste of time.

337
00:21:28,100 --> 00:21:32,380
I will say that if I had never had a major breakthrough while making YouTube poops, I

338
00:21:32,380 --> 00:21:35,000
would almost certainly have quit YouTube by now.

339
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:39,120
I have an alt account called EmperorLime where I upload 30-second long shitposts a

340
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:42,460
few times a year that only get a few thousand views each.

341
00:21:42,460 --> 00:21:47,480
I imagine that's what my channel would be today if I never got popular through YTPs.

342
00:21:47,480 --> 00:21:51,420
And I'd probably be making a living doing some boring engineering shit.

343
00:21:51,420 --> 00:21:55,760
I guess all the videos you see on my channel today are only possible because of my struggles

344
00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:57,340
in YTP.

345
00:21:57,340 --> 00:22:00,580
For what it's worth, that's something.

346
00:22:00,580 --> 00:22:04,300
I don't know how many more years it'll be before the community can just let me ride

347
00:22:04,300 --> 00:22:06,200
off into the sunset.

348
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:10,320
I've cried and whined and bitched about sour grapes for long enough.

349
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:14,120
The best outcome I can hope for at this point is for everyone to just forget about me and

350
00:22:14,120 --> 00:22:15,860
leave me to my own accord.

351
00:22:15,860 --> 00:22:20,060
I'm sure this video won't be doing me any favors there, but at least the few of you

352
00:22:20,060 --> 00:22:24,760
out there who actually care about any of this can hear my side of the story.

353
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:28,740
Maybe this whole time it's been my fault for expecting everyone to reach out to me when

354
00:22:28,740 --> 00:22:32,420
all along I should have been the one making an effort to reach out to them.

355
00:22:32,420 --> 00:22:38,400
So I did a little digging and found the guy who commented this, and I reached out to him.

356
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:42,920
It turns out he doesn't feel the same way anymore, and he actually regrets how he acted.

357
00:22:42,920 --> 00:22:46,660
He apologized to me multiple times, and I accepted it.

358
00:22:46,660 --> 00:22:49,380
So then, was this video completely pointless?

359
00:22:49,380 --> 00:22:53,700
A shameless, petty expose on some guy's hate comment that doesn't even reflect his

360
00:22:53,700 --> 00:22:54,820
current views?

361
00:22:54,820 --> 00:22:56,800
Well, not entirely.

362
00:22:56,800 --> 00:23:00,400
You know, it's not often that you get to have an honest, relaxed conversation with

363
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:02,240
one of your biggest haters.

364
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:08,580
So I asked him why I was so hated, and for the first time ever, I got a satisfying answer.

365
00:23:08,580 --> 00:23:11,040
I guess that's all I really wanted at this point.

366
00:23:11,040 --> 00:23:13,760
We ended the conversation on good terms.

367
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:17,480
It just goes to show that if you play your cards right, you can win over even your most

368
00:23:17,480 --> 00:23:18,980
passionate haters.

369
00:23:18,980 --> 00:23:24,020
I just wish I had realized that a little sooner.

370
00:23:24,020 --> 00:23:27,880
Will Emperor Lemon ever poop again?

371
00:23:27,880 --> 00:23:29,420
Most likely not.

372
00:23:29,420 --> 00:23:33,180
It amazes me that there are some people out there in my audience still anticipating a

373
00:23:33,180 --> 00:23:34,180
new YTP.

374
00:23:34,180 --> 00:23:38,780
I've certainly thought about it before, even thrown around a few ideas in editing

375
00:23:38,780 --> 00:23:43,860
software, but every time I try, I just don't have the motivation to continue.

376
00:23:43,860 --> 00:23:47,060
YTP just isn't fun for me anymore.

377
00:23:47,060 --> 00:23:48,700
I mean, just look at this video.

378
00:23:48,700 --> 00:23:53,460
I've been talking about YouTube poop for about half an hour, and I don't think I've

379
00:23:53,460 --> 00:23:54,580
told a single joke.

380
00:23:54,580 --> 00:23:58,660
It's like I can't even have fun talking about this stuff anymore.

381
00:23:59,340 --> 00:24:04,860
The only thing that's for sure about him, Lemon, is nothings for sure.

382
00:24:09,860 --> 00:24:14,860
I'm on to the next adventure now, where once again, I'm just a new guy with everything

383
00:24:14,860 --> 00:24:16,020
to prove.

384
00:24:16,020 --> 00:24:21,140
So if you take one thing away from this video, it's that hate is temporary, but YouTube

385
00:24:21,140 --> 00:24:22,780
comments are forever.

386
00:24:28,660 --> 00:24:45,760
You know, making this video really took me back to the beginning of the downward spiral,

387
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:54,140
the summer of 2016, a simpler time of YouTube drama, fine compilations, and Harambe, and

388
00:24:54,140 --> 00:24:58,860
a time when I was very uncertain about the future of this YouTube channel.

389
00:24:58,860 --> 00:25:02,300
I was starting my first semester of college, and I was really struggling to figure out

390
00:25:02,300 --> 00:25:04,740
what to do on YouTube anymore.

391
00:25:04,740 --> 00:25:09,180
I had over 100,000 subscribers at this time, but most of them had stopped watching, and

392
00:25:09,180 --> 00:25:12,100
I was losing subscribers with every upload.

393
00:25:12,100 --> 00:25:16,500
They had stopped caring, I had stopped caring, and with each video, I was finding less and

394
00:25:16,500 --> 00:25:18,640
less motivation to continue.

395
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:24,640
There came a time when I contemplated abandoning this channel entirely to focus on, gasp, a

396
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:25,800
real job.

397
00:25:25,800 --> 00:25:29,420
But then sometime during my first semester of college, I hit a really rough patch in

398
00:25:29,420 --> 00:25:34,000
my life, and I said to myself, you know what, I'm probably never going to get another chance

399
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:37,560
at this YouTube thing, so here's what I'm going to do, I'm going to spend the next few

400
00:25:37,560 --> 00:25:41,720
years putting in the effort to make my YouTube channel great again.

401
00:25:41,720 --> 00:25:47,000
And by the time I graduate, I'd be able to decide if it was worth it to continue.

402
00:25:47,280 --> 00:25:51,960
Well, I should be graduating at the end of this year, and I have to say, I'm making enough

403
00:25:51,960 --> 00:25:56,360
now where the full-time YouTube dream just might be feasible.

404
00:25:56,360 --> 00:26:00,100
And this is due in large part to the wonderful sponsors I've been able to pick up over the

405
00:26:00,100 --> 00:26:01,160
past year.

406
00:26:01,160 --> 00:26:04,120
Which brings me to the sponsor for today's video.

407
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:12,880
Zelda, my Minecraft account has been hacked by the evil forces of Ganon.

408
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:17,320
I'm going to log into my recovery email to get my account back.

409
00:26:17,320 --> 00:26:20,400
But Father, what if you forgot your recovery password?

410
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:21,400
Oh, shit.

411
00:26:21,400 --> 00:26:26,400
Gee, I just wonder if there's an affordable online service that could have easily solved

412
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:29,200
both of these problems.

413
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:31,480
This video is brought to you by Dashlane.

414
00:26:31,480 --> 00:26:35,540
If this video taught you anything, it's that I tend to make a lot of enemies online.

415
00:26:35,540 --> 00:26:41,040
And if you have a lot of enemies, it's probably a good idea to invest in some security.

416
00:26:41,040 --> 00:26:42,680
Password security.

417
00:26:42,680 --> 00:26:45,440
Dashlane is not just a password protection manager.

418
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:47,960
It's also downward spiral insurance.

419
00:26:47,960 --> 00:26:51,960
One of the fastest ways of falling into the downward spiral is having your accounts hacked

420
00:26:51,960 --> 00:26:57,560
and seized by some dude you trolled on a message board years ago, all because you thought Password

421
00:26:57,560 --> 00:26:58,560
1 was secure.

422
00:26:58,560 --> 00:27:01,560
That's the stupidest combination I've ever heard in my life!

423
00:27:01,560 --> 00:27:05,160
Oh, you stupid son of a...

424
00:27:05,160 --> 00:27:09,160
Stop worrying about passwords and let Dashlane do it for you.

425
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:13,160

427
00:27:15,720 --> 00:27:16,720
Forgetting your password?

428
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:21,160
Well then let Dashlane generate a secure password on new accounts that you'll never have to

429
00:27:21,160 --> 00:27:22,160
remember.

430
00:27:22,160 --> 00:27:26,780
Dashlane does it all for you so you can log in with a single click every time.

431
00:27:26,780 --> 00:27:28,060
Not secure enough?

432
00:27:28,060 --> 00:27:32,360
Then try Dashlane's incredible VPN service which encrypts your data at the push of a

And never worry about passwords again.

440
00:27:55,400 --> 00:28:02,080
You see, last summer I began the era of my YouTube life cycle that you all know was the

441
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:03,080
downward spiral.

442
00:28:03,080 --> 00:28:07,800
And every step of the way I have faced resistance, backlash, and naysayers.

443
00:28:07,800 --> 00:28:10,400
Everyone thought they knew what was good for my channel.

444
00:28:10,400 --> 00:28:12,400
Nobody understood the downward spiral.

445
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:14,000
And everybody questioned it.

446
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:18,520
You all questioned me, you all questioned my motives, you all questioned my goals.

447
00:28:18,520 --> 00:28:22,760
But most importantly, you questioned why the Simpsons were green.

448
00:28:22,760 --> 00:28:27,560
All I wanted to do was make green Simpsons videos for you people that'll ruin it by complaining.

449
00:28:27,560 --> 00:28:28,560
So you know what?

450
00:28:28,560 --> 00:28:30,560
No, I've become the one who complains.

451
00:28:30,560 --> 00:28:32,280
I complain here, I complain there.

452
00:28:32,280 --> 00:28:33,280
I complain everywhere.

453
00:28:33,280 --> 00:28:35,280
All I ever do is complain.

454
00:28:35,280 --> 00:28:38,280
I complain about frying Dory, and you complain back.

455
00:28:38,280 --> 00:28:39,280
So I complained even harder.

456
00:28:39,280 --> 00:28:43,280
And now frying Dory is an afterthought, just as it should have been all along.

457
00:28:43,280 --> 00:28:46,280
And it's funny to me, because you all considered me an afterthought.

458
00:28:46,280 --> 00:28:47,280
You all wrote me off.

459
00:28:47,280 --> 00:28:49,280
You all left this channel for dead.

460
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:51,280
You put me on the downward spiral.

461
00:28:51,280 --> 00:28:52,280
So you know what I did?

462
00:28:52,280 --> 00:28:53,280
I wrote that shit.

463
00:28:53,280 --> 00:28:56,280
I took the ball you people gave me and fucking ran with it.

464
00:28:56,280 --> 00:28:59,280
Because when you're in a downward spiral, there's no escaping it.

465
00:28:59,280 --> 00:29:01,280
So you might as well aim for the bottom.

466
00:29:01,280 --> 00:29:02,280
Attention!

467
00:29:02,280 --> 00:29:07,280
