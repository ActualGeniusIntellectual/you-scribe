00:00.000 --> 00:16.700
Welcome everyone to a new series that I call Frying Comments.

00:16.700 --> 00:21.360
Now some of my older viewers will remember that years ago I made a few videos thumping

00:21.360 --> 00:29.440
some hapless goobers in my comment section.

00:29.440 --> 00:33.200
And needless to say, this video is not that.

00:33.200 --> 00:38.320
All of you have probably seen your fair share of comment response videos on YouTube where

00:38.320 --> 00:44.000
big and proud YouTubers sarcastically mock the utter peons beneath them as the slime

00:44.000 --> 00:45.800
between their toes.

00:45.800 --> 00:47.520
This video is not that.

00:47.520 --> 00:51.640
Oh no, I'm not flying over anyone's heads here.

00:51.640 --> 00:55.960
All of you who watch me know that my spiral only points in one direction.

00:55.960 --> 01:00.720
And that's down, down, down, which is exactly where I'm going today.

01:00.720 --> 01:05.640
Because in this series, we're not dealing with your average, everyday criticism.

01:05.640 --> 01:09.040
This is advanced criticism.

01:09.040 --> 01:13.640
Today we are sinking to depths that no channel of my size should ever reach.

01:13.640 --> 01:17.760
We are reaching levels of pettiness that shouldn't even be possible.

01:17.760 --> 01:22.960
Today we aren't just glazing over an eclectic compilation of posts as you may expect from

01:22.960 --> 01:24.240
a video like this.

01:24.240 --> 01:30.760
Rather, we are going to examine just a single comment, posted over a year ago, that nobody

01:30.760 --> 01:32.440
cares about.

01:32.440 --> 01:44.960
Nobody besides me.

01:44.960 --> 01:50.080
Lol you're hopping onto whatever bandwagon you can to try and get as many views as possible

01:50.080 --> 01:52.040
and spread your unfunny shit.

01:52.040 --> 01:55.240
It's a shame your fanbase can't see past this.

01:55.240 --> 02:00.440
The commenter here assumes that I'm trend-hopping based on my video's trendy subject matter.

02:00.440 --> 02:04.500
While I would disagree with this claim, the important aspect here is what would lead someone

02:04.500 --> 02:06.040
to make this claim.

02:06.040 --> 02:11.040
Looking at my channel now, seeing me make videos about Dale Earnhardt, court cases,

02:11.040 --> 02:15.040
and Leafy more than a year after people stopped watching him, it's pretty obvious that I'm

02:15.040 --> 02:17.320
not quite the trendiest YouTube channel.

02:17.320 --> 02:22.000
But at the time this comment was posted, this was actually a much more reasonable claim,

02:22.000 --> 02:23.960
considering the era that preceded it.

02:23.960 --> 02:27.760
Those of you who are new to the channel may not actually know this, but I used to make

02:27.760 --> 02:29.700
YouTube poops.

02:29.700 --> 02:35.320
For the first five years of this channel, all I did was make YouTube poops, a time period

02:35.320 --> 02:38.880
which constitutes the primary focus of this video.

02:38.880 --> 02:40.640
Let's find out why.

02:40.640 --> 02:45.780
The YTP community has seen so many amazing and talented people leave the community or

02:45.780 --> 02:49.760
simply stop making videos for various reasons.

02:49.760 --> 02:55.680
Why the fuck are we stuck with you?

02:55.680 --> 02:59.580
I've never really had a good relationship with the YTP community.

02:59.580 --> 03:02.360
For the longest time, I was totally isolated.

03:02.360 --> 03:03.960
I never talked to anybody.

03:03.960 --> 03:06.080
All I really did was watch and listen.

03:06.080 --> 03:10.560
I can't really say for sure what exactly I did to get on people's nerves, but I can

03:10.560 --> 03:12.820
make an educated guess.

03:12.820 --> 03:18.000
Now the idea of drama in the YTP community may seem shocking and counterintuitive to

03:18.000 --> 03:27.960
many of you, but believe me, it exists.

03:27.960 --> 03:32.120
How could such silly videos lead to such bitterness and resentment?

03:32.120 --> 03:33.800
I can't really explain it.

03:33.800 --> 03:37.680
I guess it's like any other online community where some people are loved and some people

03:37.680 --> 03:42.920
are hated, and more often than not, I tend to fall on the side of the hated.

03:42.920 --> 03:44.800
Maybe it's because I didn't talk enough.

03:44.800 --> 03:47.080
Maybe it's because I talked too much.

03:47.080 --> 03:52.260
No one has ever given me a comprehensive explanation, so the best I can do is speculate.

03:52.260 --> 03:55.120
That's all I've been able to do for all this time.

03:55.120 --> 03:57.940
Maybe this comment can lead me to some answers.

03:57.940 --> 04:02.780
Your fans are a bunch of easily amused fucking idiots who find shitty content creators like

04:02.780 --> 04:04.120
you entertaining.

04:04.120 --> 04:08.740
The only reason you even had a large number of subs in the first place is because of those

04:08.740 --> 04:13.560
Pixar YTPs you made, which were pretty fucking shit to begin with.

04:13.560 --> 04:17.720
Your actual non-Pixar content wasn't earning you many subs.

04:17.720 --> 04:19.880
The sentiment here is pretty clear.

04:19.880 --> 04:24.840
My YTPs are more popular than they deserve to be, and I don't necessarily disagree

04:24.840 --> 04:26.000
with that.

04:26.000 --> 04:32.280
In mid-2013, I had less than 4,000 subscribers, and then I uploaded The Uncredibles, a video

04:32.280 --> 04:34.160
that changed everything.

04:34.160 --> 04:39.060
It was my first video to reach a million views, and the popularity of this video carried over

04:39.060 --> 04:44.180
to six of my next YTPs, which would also pass a million views.

04:44.180 --> 04:49.220
To this day, nearly six years later, more people have watched The Uncredibles than any

04:49.220 --> 04:51.080
other video on my channel.

04:51.080 --> 04:54.780
So did I make these videos with the intent of getting popular on YouTube?

04:54.780 --> 04:58.400
Well, no, but I can understand why people may think that.

04:58.400 --> 05:04.660
The source material is very common and accessible, consisting of SpongeBob and Pixar movies,

05:04.660 --> 05:09.340
which contrasts heavily with the more obscure sources of older YTPs.

05:09.340 --> 05:13.380
Looking at this aspect, one could infer that I specifically chose these sources with the

05:13.380 --> 05:15.740
intent of getting lots of views.

05:15.740 --> 05:19.720
In reality, The Uncredibles was only just supposed to be the next video in line and

05:19.720 --> 05:20.840
nothing else.

05:20.840 --> 05:25.440
The fact that it, among these other videos, got so popular had to do more with the audience

05:25.440 --> 05:29.540
selectively preferring the source material because it was so accessible.

05:29.540 --> 05:33.380
The reason I chose these sources in the first place was because I watched them a lot as

05:33.380 --> 05:38.540
a kid and I wanted to remix them, not because I wanted more people to watch them.

05:38.540 --> 05:43.000
A lot of people also seemed to miss that during this time, I didn't exclusively upload what

05:43.000 --> 05:48.780
you'd call trendy sources, and consequently, those videos received far less views.

05:48.780 --> 05:51.440
None of this was ever by design on my end.

05:51.440 --> 05:55.680
To put it simply, if I was in the business of getting views, I probably wouldn't have

05:55.680 --> 05:59.140
spent five straight years making YouTube poops.

05:59.140 --> 06:03.780
In the vast majority of cases, YTPs don't get many views.

06:03.780 --> 06:09.340
So when my YTPs all of a sudden started getting many, many views, I and a lot of other people

06:09.340 --> 06:10.860
didn't know how to react.

06:10.860 --> 06:17.220
I started 2013 getting a few thousand views on my videos and I ended 2014 getting millions.

06:17.220 --> 06:20.620
Did my videos get a thousand percent more entertaining?

06:20.620 --> 06:23.340
Was I putting in a thousand percent more effort?

06:23.340 --> 06:25.020
No, obviously not.

06:25.020 --> 06:29.340
Personally, I thought I was making them about the same as all my older videos, but with

06:29.340 --> 06:34.540
that being said, my sudden meteoric rise in popularity was met with skepticism by a lot

06:34.540 --> 06:39.100
of people in the YTP community, and a lot of people were beginning to sense a great

06:39.100 --> 06:43.620
inequity between the views I got and the views they thought I deserved.

06:43.620 --> 06:48.900
I began to notice it sometime in the spring of 2014 after uploading my second Incredibles

06:48.900 --> 06:50.980
video, The Non-Credibles.

06:50.980 --> 06:55.300
On this video, I received comments from two other well-known YouTube poopers, Hurricoaster

06:55.300 --> 06:56.780
and Chemistry Guy.

06:56.780 --> 07:01.520
I remember both of these comments offering some shockingly blunt criticism of what they

07:01.520 --> 07:07.260
perceived as a change in my style, each delivered with the implication that I had sold out to

07:07.260 --> 07:09.360
a more mainstream audience.

07:09.360 --> 07:12.180
At the time, I found these comments very discouraging.

07:12.180 --> 07:18.220
How these two poopers whom I admired and respected were utterly disappointed in how I had changed.

07:18.260 --> 07:21.140
The problem was that I didn't think I had changed.

07:21.140 --> 07:25.680
I figured my process with this video had been the same as it was years ago when I had made

07:25.680 --> 07:28.020
videos that they supposedly enjoyed.

07:28.020 --> 07:33.900
The only real difference in my mind was that now I was popular, while then I was a nobody.

07:33.900 --> 07:39.040
Clearly, the notion that these guys were disappointed implies that at one time they had high expectations

07:39.040 --> 07:43.480
of me, and the fact that they decided to critique me directly indicates that they only had my

07:43.480 --> 07:44.860
best interests in mind.

07:45.040 --> 07:49.380
I still respect both of these guys, and both of them still leave comments on my stuff every

07:49.380 --> 07:54.880
now and then, but these two comments left on this video really bothered me, mostly because

07:54.880 --> 07:58.320
I could never reconcile their newfound perception of me.

07:58.320 --> 08:02.340
Over time, I could really only conclude that they disliked my videos because they were

08:02.340 --> 08:07.380
popular, and I reinforced this idea about a year later in the spring of 2015.

08:14.860 --> 08:25.700
I had uploaded Deep Frying Nemo, the final installment of my quest to remix the entirety

08:25.700 --> 08:27.380
of Finding Nemo.

08:27.380 --> 08:32.580
The Frying Nemo saga spanned eight months and four videos, the last of which represented

08:32.580 --> 08:36.120
the most effort I had ever put into a video at that point.

08:36.120 --> 08:40.880
There used to be this YTP forum called Youchu where I spent a lot of time lurking.

08:40.880 --> 08:44.600
I tried to make an account there once, but they never sent me the email to confirm my

08:44.600 --> 08:50.140
account, so I took it as a sign to forever remain a lurker, and lurk I did.

08:50.140 --> 08:55.040
The day I uploaded Deep Frying Nemo, I saw an unusual amount of backlash about it on

08:55.040 --> 08:56.040
Youchu.

08:56.040 --> 09:01.300
Now, of course everyone is entitled to their opinions, and in hindsight, I actually agree

09:01.300 --> 09:05.880
with what a lot of them have to say, but for a forum where everyone tends to act aloof

09:05.880 --> 09:10.940
and disinterested, there were certainly a lot of people going out of their way to critique

09:10.940 --> 09:11.940
my video.

09:11.940 --> 09:16.900
It wasn't the content of the criticism that bothered me, rather the quantity of people

09:16.900 --> 09:22.040
coming out of the woodwork to express their dissatisfaction with me, a guy who never posted

09:22.040 --> 09:25.320
anything or interacted with anyone on the forum.

09:25.320 --> 09:27.460
Why did they care so much?

09:27.460 --> 09:30.680
Why did I care so much about what they had to say?

09:30.680 --> 09:39.300
Why do I care so much about what this guy has to say?

09:39.300 --> 09:42.280
I started making YTPs way back in 2010.

09:42.280 --> 09:46.280
I was just a kid at the time, and it seemed like a fun hobby to get into.

09:46.280 --> 09:51.180
At this time, I had no idea what I was doing and basically did whatever impulsively came

09:51.180 --> 09:56.100
to my mind, but for some reason, a lot of people started watching my videos.

09:56.100 --> 10:02.400
Early influential poopers like Barneyisperverted and linkondrugs became fans of me, a 13-year-old

10:02.400 --> 10:06.480
who was still trying to figure out the basic functions of my editing software.

10:06.480 --> 10:10.500
Of course, they didn't know that, nobody did, but it didn't matter because I was getting

10:10.500 --> 10:13.060
moderate popularity regardless.

10:13.060 --> 10:18.740
I'll always remember when one day I went from less than 10 subscribers to over 100, a measly

10:18.740 --> 10:23.480
amount compared to my standards today, but at the time, I considered it my single greatest

10:23.480 --> 10:27.340
accomplishment, not just in YouTube, but in life.

10:27.340 --> 10:32.480
For years growing up, my YouTube channel was the one single thing I was truly proud of,

10:32.480 --> 10:37.500
and YTP became one of the only defining traits of my identity, so maybe that's why I started

10:37.500 --> 10:39.540
taking it so seriously.

10:39.540 --> 10:43.980
Maybe serious is the wrong word, but around the time of the Pixar poops, I certainly started

10:43.980 --> 10:45.100
trying harder.

10:45.100 --> 10:50.240
I started making longer videos with more intensive editing, and I kept getting rewarded with

10:50.240 --> 10:52.800
wild popularity in my genre.

10:52.800 --> 11:01.220
But after getting so many views and subscribers, I really only cared about one thing, respect.

11:01.220 --> 11:05.160
I tried to be gracious and humble in the wake of my success.

11:05.160 --> 11:09.900
I hosted several collabs to try to showcase the talent of lesser-known poopers.

11:09.900 --> 11:14.680
I made two videos in which I tried sharing my success with other poopers whom I thought

11:14.680 --> 11:15.680
deserved it.

11:15.680 --> 11:19.860
I gave over 30 shout-outs and recommendations to my newfound audience.

11:19.860 --> 11:25.120
One of those shout-outs going to a guy called Stuart K. Reilly, who was perhaps my favorite

11:25.120 --> 11:26.980
pooper at the time.

11:26.980 --> 11:32.700
Stu was an old-school guy who was very influential in innovating the genre to a more modern style,

11:32.700 --> 11:36.040
and he was one of the leading contributors to the YouTube forums.

11:36.040 --> 11:41.900
But most notably, Stu was a guy who ran a series called YTP News, a series that taught

11:41.900 --> 11:45.800
me more about YTP than any other source.

11:45.800 --> 11:50.760
Without YTP News, it's doubtful that I'd be making any videos today.

11:50.760 --> 11:54.880
I remember watching one episode where Stu spent about 16 minutes ranting about a guy

11:54.880 --> 12:01.520
called Waxinator, a pooper he deemed overrated, pandering, and not representative of what

12:01.520 --> 12:03.200
YTP should be.

12:03.200 --> 12:08.740
And I remember thinking at the time, yeah, screw Waxinator, why does he have what other

12:08.740 --> 12:10.480
people deserve?

12:10.480 --> 12:15.680
Well, it turned out that a few years later, I was the new Waxinator.

12:15.680 --> 12:19.200
I was the one getting called overrated and pandering.

12:19.200 --> 12:24.640
Ironically, people respected me more when I had no viewers and no idea what I was doing.

12:24.640 --> 12:29.760
When I started getting popular, I lost the only thing that I would end up caring about.

12:29.760 --> 12:34.600
YouTube Poop originated as a way to mock and deride traditional media through remixing

12:34.600 --> 12:35.700
and editing.

12:35.700 --> 12:40.680
It is counterculture by its very nature, and it's always meant to rally against some kind

12:40.680 --> 12:42.320
of establishment.

12:42.320 --> 12:47.340
Paradoxically, popular YouTube Poopers can never be truly respected because when you

12:47.340 --> 12:51.440
enter the mainstream, you become the establishment.

12:51.440 --> 12:56.320
That is the main reason why I believe I became hated in the YTP community.

12:56.320 --> 12:59.640
The only problem being I didn't choose to get popular.

12:59.640 --> 13:02.180
YTP was always just a hobby for me.

13:02.180 --> 13:06.360
For more than five years, I got millions of views and didn't make a cent of revenue off

13:06.360 --> 13:10.800
of it because simply creating the videos was rewarding enough for me.

13:10.800 --> 13:15.080
I didn't really care about the power or the clout or the influence because I never really

13:15.080 --> 13:18.360
saw myself as an influential person.

13:18.360 --> 13:22.920
I was just making funny edits for fun, and everyone else was welcome to come along for

13:22.920 --> 13:23.920
the ride.

13:23.920 --> 13:28.220
There was never a point when I decided to sell out and become the establishment.

13:28.220 --> 13:31.520
It just sort of happened based on factors out of my control.

13:31.520 --> 13:35.800
And there came a point during the production of Deepfrying Nemo when I decided that I wanted

13:35.800 --> 13:36.800
to go back.

13:36.800 --> 13:42.560
I wanted to return to the old days when nobody knew about me and YTP was still fun and experimental

13:42.560 --> 13:43.960
and adventurous.

13:43.960 --> 13:48.080
This desire is what led me to eventually create Green Simpsons.

13:48.080 --> 13:52.360
And although I really had fun making it, I suspected deep down that things would never

13:52.360 --> 13:53.560
be the same.

14:01.560 --> 14:03.160
What, you've gotten complaints?

14:03.160 --> 14:04.160
Complaints?

14:04.160 --> 14:05.160
I can handle it.

14:05.160 --> 14:06.160
What, you've gotten complaints?

14:06.520 --> 14:07.520
I can handle it.

14:07.520 --> 14:08.520
Complaints?

14:08.520 --> 14:09.520
Complaints?

14:09.520 --> 14:10.520
I can handle it.

14:10.520 --> 14:12.720
What I can't handle is complaints.

14:12.720 --> 14:17.400
The part of my audience that didn't immediately stop watching then and there started complaining

14:17.400 --> 14:22.120
about the video much in the same way that Yu-Chu had done years before, and I had had

14:22.120 --> 14:23.120
enough.

14:23.120 --> 14:27.760
I never signed up to be lectured and ridiculed over a voluntary hobby of mine that was supposed

14:27.760 --> 14:28.760
to be fun.

14:28.760 --> 14:32.520
So I lashed out at them, my very own audience.

14:32.520 --> 14:37.200
In my mind, they were the ones who took away my enjoyment of YTP, and they were the ones

14:37.200 --> 14:40.200
who prevented me from earning the respect I deserved.

14:40.200 --> 14:44.280
I was finally going to do what Hercoaster and Chemistry Guy and the Yu-Chu forums told

14:44.280 --> 14:47.640
me I should have been doing and make videos that I wanted.

14:47.640 --> 14:52.640
I even changed my YouTube username to signify the beginning of a new era.

14:52.640 --> 14:54.280
But that didn't change anything.

14:54.280 --> 14:58.820
I still saw my new videos getting backlash on Yu-Chu, and at the center of it all was

14:58.820 --> 15:01.480
good ol' Stuart K. Reilly.

15:01.480 --> 15:03.200
All I wanted was to help you.

15:03.200 --> 15:06.560
I only wanted to help, and what did you say to me?

15:06.560 --> 15:11.820
I think Lemon has been on a downward spiral mentally, and now he's lost it completely.

15:11.820 --> 15:15.460
It tore me apart, but I learned an important lesson.

15:15.460 --> 15:19.160
You can't count on anyone, especially your heroes.

15:19.160 --> 15:21.680
I was wrong to treat you that way.

15:21.680 --> 15:22.680
I'm sorry.

15:22.680 --> 15:23.680
See?

15:23.680 --> 15:25.880
Now you respect me, because I'm a threat.

15:25.880 --> 15:27.480
I'll give them downward spiral.

15:27.480 --> 15:31.240
I'll give them the most spectacular downward spiral anyone's ever seen.

15:32.000 --> 15:36.640
And this, right here, was the origin of the downward spiral.

15:36.640 --> 15:40.560
I had moved beyond salvaging anything on my channel at this point.

15:40.560 --> 15:45.120
I had given up everything, the support of thousands of fans, to chase the respect I

15:45.120 --> 15:46.120
wanted.

15:46.120 --> 15:50.640
And at this moment, it dawned on me that I would never, ever get it.

15:50.640 --> 15:55.180
Over the past three years, I had witnessed my fun hobby become completely soiled with

15:55.180 --> 15:58.040
bitterness, resentment, and complaints.

15:58.040 --> 16:00.560
So, so many complaints.

16:00.560 --> 16:03.760
The only thing left for me to do was complain back.

16:03.760 --> 16:09.440
And when I'm old and I've had my fun, I'll sell my spiral so that everyone can be downward.

16:09.440 --> 16:11.120
Everyone can complain.

16:11.120 --> 16:22.280
And when everyone's on a downward spiral, no one will be.

16:22.280 --> 16:27.000
I started by publishing a 12-page document complaining about YouTubers and their mistreatment

16:27.000 --> 16:28.760
of popular YouTube poopers.

16:28.760 --> 16:33.640
I complained about how they had become the true establishment of the YTP community.

16:33.640 --> 16:38.760
I complained about how Stuart K. Reilly ruined everything and created the downward spiral.

16:38.760 --> 16:42.340
Then I turned around to my YouTube channel and complained about politics, complained

16:42.340 --> 16:46.560
about high school, complained about people complaining about me complaining, then complained

16:46.560 --> 16:50.420
about people complaining about me responding to their complaints.

16:50.420 --> 16:54.920
All this new complaining didn't leave much room for YouTube poops, and eventually I stopped

16:54.920 --> 16:55.980
making them.

16:55.980 --> 16:57.320
There was never a goodbye.

16:57.720 --> 16:59.800
I never planned a finale.

16:59.800 --> 17:01.680
Most poopers go out this way.

17:01.680 --> 17:05.460
You never even know they're gone until you stumble upon their channel one day and they

17:05.460 --> 17:07.680
haven't uploaded in years.

17:07.680 --> 17:11.960
Most poopers leave gracefully and are remembered fondly, which is what this comment was alluding

17:11.960 --> 17:13.460
to at the beginning.

17:13.460 --> 17:14.560
Not me, though.

17:14.560 --> 17:18.680
I was hated for leaving according to this comment, and I was hated for staying according

17:18.680 --> 17:19.680
to this comment.

17:19.680 --> 17:26.060
I find it rather fitting that I left YTP in the same way I entered, alone, not respected,

17:26.060 --> 17:27.860
with nobody watching.

17:27.860 --> 17:31.540
After more than seven years of service, that's my legacy.

17:31.540 --> 17:34.540
I keep this comment around because it's a testament to that.

17:41.740 --> 17:46.420
Luckily for me, I guess I was good enough at complaining to get a second chance on YouTube,

17:46.420 --> 17:50.520
and more people watch me now than ever did when I made YTPs.

17:50.520 --> 17:53.900
Complaining sort of replaced YTP as my new identity.

17:53.900 --> 17:57.300
The hate never went away, and I didn't really expect it to.

17:57.300 --> 18:00.080
I think that became part of my identity, too.

18:00.080 --> 18:04.940
At least now I get hated for valid reasons, as opposed to not being good enough at making

18:04.940 --> 18:07.200
goofy edits of kids' shows.

18:07.200 --> 18:09.800
How did things get so bad between us?

18:09.800 --> 18:13.700
This comment is just so bitter on an oddly personal level.

18:13.700 --> 18:19.180
I know this is also the guy who ran the EL Fan YTP troll account, a channel single-handedly

18:19.180 --> 18:22.280
dedicated to hating me for more than two years.

18:22.280 --> 18:26.680
They finally got bored of me not responding and closed the channel at the end of last year.

18:26.680 --> 18:31.100
Keep in mind, I have never talked to this person before in my entire life.

18:31.100 --> 18:35.360
I think this person also started a Discord server of other YouTube poopers who hate me,

18:35.360 --> 18:39.840
and they carried on the legacy with this imposter Vidly account that still produces content

18:39.840 --> 18:41.020
to this day.

18:41.020 --> 18:44.380
I haven't uploaded a YTP since 2017.

18:44.380 --> 18:49.000
It astounds me how even today, the biggest source of bitterness and resentment towards

18:49.000 --> 18:55.340
me comes, still, from the YTP community, a group of people who supposedly makes comedy

18:55.340 --> 18:57.120
videos for fun.

18:57.120 --> 19:02.120
I tweeted this out as a reply to DaThings, a YouTube pooper who publicly chastised me

19:02.120 --> 19:04.080
for making an edgy joke.

19:04.080 --> 19:05.800
He later apologized.

19:05.800 --> 19:10.360
Other YouTube poopers like Attack of the Hank and Good Ol' Stu still take jabs at me despite

19:10.360 --> 19:15.560
us having absolutely no connection other than a loose genre video we used to make.

19:15.560 --> 19:17.280
I don't need anyone's apology.

19:17.280 --> 19:18.640
I don't need anyone's sympathy.

19:18.640 --> 19:20.280
I'm not a victim here.

19:20.280 --> 19:24.960
But if you can find any former YouTube pooper out there who gets repeatedly hated as much

19:24.960 --> 19:27.880
as I do, I'd be happy to hear about them.

19:27.880 --> 19:30.520
I understand that I bring a lot of it on myself.

19:30.520 --> 19:33.720
I definitely regret a lot of the stuff I said in the past.

19:33.720 --> 19:38.440
I started a whole melodramatic thread after this demanding an explanation from the YTP

19:38.440 --> 19:42.560
community, and like I said at the beginning of this video, no one was able to give me

19:42.560 --> 19:44.720
a comprehensive explanation.

19:44.720 --> 19:49.280
So the best I can still do is speculate.

19:49.280 --> 19:54.080
A lot of people ask me why I make this issue about the YTP community as a whole.

19:54.080 --> 19:58.120
I don't really even know how to define the YTP community anymore.

19:58.120 --> 20:02.640
It doesn't mean YouTube because the site shut down last year long after I and a lot of other

20:02.640 --> 20:04.500
people stopped caring about it.

20:04.500 --> 20:08.880
What remains of the community has either moved on to new frontiers or spread themselves out

20:08.880 --> 20:11.380
among a dozen or so micro communities.

20:11.380 --> 20:14.460
I guess I've always felt it's been me against everyone else.

20:14.460 --> 20:18.680
And even when it ain't so, I have a knack of running my mouth and turning the community

20:18.680 --> 20:20.500
against me regardless.

20:20.500 --> 20:24.620
Here I am making a video about it, making the problem exponentially worse.

20:24.620 --> 20:27.860
Don't try to go hunt down any of the people in this video, by the way.

20:27.860 --> 20:29.520
This isn't about the people.

20:29.520 --> 20:31.760
I only care about the ideas.

20:31.760 --> 20:35.840
Maybe the reason I care so much about this is that I'm trying my hardest to justify the

20:35.840 --> 20:39.560
purpose of the first five and a half years I spent on this website.

20:39.560 --> 20:44.000
I mean, yeah, I used the skills and audience I gained during the YouTube poop era to transition

20:44.000 --> 20:45.740
to greener pastures today.

20:45.740 --> 20:49.980
I learned from my mistakes in the past and I worked towards not repeating them.

20:49.980 --> 20:52.480
And now I'm doing the best I've ever been on YouTube.

20:52.480 --> 20:56.860
Ironically, I became more respected by the greater YouTube community than I ever was

20:56.860 --> 20:58.720
by the YTP community.

20:58.720 --> 21:00.900
EmperorLemon posted this on Twitter.

21:00.900 --> 21:03.960
It raises the question of why I didn't leave sooner.

21:03.960 --> 21:07.240
I don't necessarily think it's fair to throw out a bunch of what ifs.

21:07.240 --> 21:11.920
I think I am where I am today because of the very specific chain of events that preceded it.

21:11.920 --> 21:15.820
I certainly don't think I would be nearly as successful if it weren't for my experiences

21:15.820 --> 21:19.140
making YouTube poops, both positive and negative.

21:19.140 --> 21:24.300
However, I'd like to think it mattered more than just a simple stepping stone to the next frontier.

21:24.300 --> 21:28.100
I'd like to believe the whole thing wasn't just a big waste of time.

21:28.100 --> 21:32.380
I will say that if I had never had a major breakthrough while making YouTube poops, I

21:32.380 --> 21:35.000
would almost certainly have quit YouTube by now.

21:35.000 --> 21:39.120
I have an alt account called EmperorLime where I upload 30-second long shitposts a

21:39.120 --> 21:42.460
few times a year that only get a few thousand views each.

21:42.460 --> 21:47.480
I imagine that's what my channel would be today if I never got popular through YTPs.

21:47.480 --> 21:51.420
And I'd probably be making a living doing some boring engineering shit.

21:51.420 --> 21:55.760
I guess all the videos you see on my channel today are only possible because of my struggles

21:55.760 --> 21:57.340
in YTP.

21:57.340 --> 22:00.580
For what it's worth, that's something.

22:00.580 --> 22:04.300
I don't know how many more years it'll be before the community can just let me ride

22:04.300 --> 22:06.200
off into the sunset.

22:06.200 --> 22:10.320
I've cried and whined and bitched about sour grapes for long enough.

22:10.320 --> 22:14.120
The best outcome I can hope for at this point is for everyone to just forget about me and

22:14.120 --> 22:15.860
leave me to my own accord.

22:15.860 --> 22:20.060
I'm sure this video won't be doing me any favors there, but at least the few of you

22:20.060 --> 22:24.760
out there who actually care about any of this can hear my side of the story.

22:24.760 --> 22:28.740
Maybe this whole time it's been my fault for expecting everyone to reach out to me when

22:28.740 --> 22:32.420
all along I should have been the one making an effort to reach out to them.

22:32.420 --> 22:38.400
So I did a little digging and found the guy who commented this, and I reached out to him.

22:38.400 --> 22:42.920
It turns out he doesn't feel the same way anymore, and he actually regrets how he acted.

22:42.920 --> 22:46.660
He apologized to me multiple times, and I accepted it.

22:46.660 --> 22:49.380
So then, was this video completely pointless?

22:49.380 --> 22:53.700
A shameless, petty expose on some guy's hate comment that doesn't even reflect his

22:53.700 --> 22:54.820
current views?

22:54.820 --> 22:56.800
Well, not entirely.

22:56.800 --> 23:00.400
You know, it's not often that you get to have an honest, relaxed conversation with

23:00.400 --> 23:02.240
one of your biggest haters.

23:02.240 --> 23:08.580
So I asked him why I was so hated, and for the first time ever, I got a satisfying answer.

23:08.580 --> 23:11.040
I guess that's all I really wanted at this point.

23:11.040 --> 23:13.760
We ended the conversation on good terms.

23:13.760 --> 23:17.480
It just goes to show that if you play your cards right, you can win over even your most

23:17.480 --> 23:18.980
passionate haters.

23:18.980 --> 23:24.020
I just wish I had realized that a little sooner.

23:24.020 --> 23:27.880
Will Emperor Lemon ever poop again?

23:27.880 --> 23:29.420
Most likely not.

23:29.420 --> 23:33.180
It amazes me that there are some people out there in my audience still anticipating a

23:33.180 --> 23:34.180
new YTP.

23:34.180 --> 23:38.780
I've certainly thought about it before, even thrown around a few ideas in editing

23:38.780 --> 23:43.860
software, but every time I try, I just don't have the motivation to continue.

23:43.860 --> 23:47.060
YTP just isn't fun for me anymore.

23:47.060 --> 23:48.700
I mean, just look at this video.

23:48.700 --> 23:53.460
I've been talking about YouTube poop for about half an hour, and I don't think I've

23:53.460 --> 23:54.580
told a single joke.

23:54.580 --> 23:58.660
It's like I can't even have fun talking about this stuff anymore.

23:59.340 --> 24:04.860
The only thing that's for sure about him, Lemon, is nothings for sure.

24:09.860 --> 24:14.860
I'm on to the next adventure now, where once again, I'm just a new guy with everything

24:14.860 --> 24:16.020
to prove.

24:16.020 --> 24:21.140
So if you take one thing away from this video, it's that hate is temporary, but YouTube

24:21.140 --> 24:22.780
comments are forever.

24:28.660 --> 24:45.760
You know, making this video really took me back to the beginning of the downward spiral,

24:45.760 --> 24:54.140
the summer of 2016, a simpler time of YouTube drama, fine compilations, and Harambe, and

24:54.140 --> 24:58.860
a time when I was very uncertain about the future of this YouTube channel.

24:58.860 --> 25:02.300
I was starting my first semester of college, and I was really struggling to figure out

25:02.300 --> 25:04.740
what to do on YouTube anymore.

25:04.740 --> 25:09.180
I had over 100,000 subscribers at this time, but most of them had stopped watching, and

25:09.180 --> 25:12.100
I was losing subscribers with every upload.

25:12.100 --> 25:16.500
They had stopped caring, I had stopped caring, and with each video, I was finding less and

25:16.500 --> 25:18.640
less motivation to continue.

25:18.640 --> 25:24.640
There came a time when I contemplated abandoning this channel entirely to focus on, gasp, a

25:24.640 --> 25:25.800
real job.

25:25.800 --> 25:29.420
But then sometime during my first semester of college, I hit a really rough patch in

25:29.420 --> 25:34.000
my life, and I said to myself, you know what, I'm probably never going to get another chance

25:34.000 --> 25:37.560
at this YouTube thing, so here's what I'm going to do, I'm going to spend the next few

25:37.560 --> 25:41.720
years putting in the effort to make my YouTube channel great again.

25:41.720 --> 25:47.000
And by the time I graduate, I'd be able to decide if it was worth it to continue.

25:47.280 --> 25:51.960
Well, I should be graduating at the end of this year, and I have to say, I'm making enough

25:51.960 --> 25:56.360
now where the full-time YouTube dream just might be feasible.

25:56.360 --> 26:00.100
And this is due in large part to the wonderful sponsors I've been able to pick up over the

26:00.100 --> 26:01.160
past year.

26:01.160 --> 26:04.120
Which brings me to the sponsor for today's video.

26:09.120 --> 26:12.880
Zelda, my Minecraft account has been hacked by the evil forces of Ganon.

26:12.960 --> 26:17.320
I'm going to log into my recovery email to get my account back.

26:17.320 --> 26:20.400
But Father, what if you forgot your recovery password?

26:20.400 --> 26:21.400
Oh, shit.

26:21.400 --> 26:26.400
Gee, I just wonder if there's an affordable online service that could have easily solved

26:26.400 --> 26:29.200
both of these problems.

26:29.200 --> 26:31.480
This video is brought to you by Dashlane.

26:31.480 --> 26:35.540
If this video taught you anything, it's that I tend to make a lot of enemies online.

26:35.540 --> 26:41.040
And if you have a lot of enemies, it's probably a good idea to invest in some security.

26:41.040 --> 26:42.680
Password security.

26:42.680 --> 26:45.440
Dashlane is not just a password protection manager.

26:45.440 --> 26:47.960
It's also downward spiral insurance.

26:47.960 --> 26:51.960
One of the fastest ways of falling into the downward spiral is having your accounts hacked

26:51.960 --> 26:57.560
and seized by some dude you trolled on a message board years ago, all because you thought Password

26:57.560 --> 26:58.560
1 was secure.

26:58.560 --> 27:01.560
That's the stupidest combination I've ever heard in my life!

27:01.560 --> 27:05.160

27:55.400 --> 28:02.080
You see, last summer I began the era of my YouTube life cycle that you all know was the

28:02.080 --> 28:03.080
downward spiral.

28:03.080 --> 28:07.800
And every step of the way I have faced resistance, backlash, and naysayers.

28:07.800 --> 28:10.400
Everyone thought they knew what was good for my channel.

28:10.400 --> 28:12.400
Nobody understood the downward spiral.

28:12.400 --> 28:14.000
And everybody questioned it.

28:14.000 --> 28:18.520
You all questioned me, you all questioned my motives, you all questioned my goals.

28:18.520 --> 28:22.760
But most importantly, you questioned why the Simpsons were green.

28:22.760 --> 28:27.560
All I wanted to do was make green Simpsons videos for you people that'll ruin it by complaining.

28:27.560 --> 28:28.560
So you know what?

28:28.560 --> 28:30.560
No, I've become the one who complains.

28:30.560 --> 28:32.280
I complain here, I complain there.

28:32.280 --> 28:33.280
I complain everywhere.

28:33.280 --> 28:35.280
All I ever do is complain.

28:35.280 --> 28:38.280
I complain about frying Dory, and you complain back.

28:38.280 --> 28:39.280
So I complained even harder.

28:39.280 --> 28:43.280
And now frying Dory is an afterthought, just as it should have been all along.

28:43.280 --> 28:46.280
And it's funny to me, because you all considered me an afterthought.

28:46.280 --> 28:47.280
You all wrote me off.

28:47.280 --> 28:49.280
You all left this channel for dead.

28:49.280 --> 28:51.280
You put me on the downward spiral.

28:51.280 --> 28:52.280
So you know what I did?

28:52.280 --> 28:53.280
I wrote that shit.

28:53.280 --> 28:56.280
I took the ball you people gave me and fucking ran with it.

28:56.280 --> 28:59.280
Because when you're in a downward spiral, there's no escaping it.

28:59.280 --> 29:01.280
So you might as well aim for the bottom.

29:01.280 --> 29:02.280
