00:00.000 --> 00:06.480
You know, the average American probably can't tell you who lives in 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue.

00:06.480 --> 00:11.760
Hello, Mr. Donald Trump. I am here to inform you that I am placing you under citizen's arrest.

00:11.760 --> 00:12.960
What are you, morons?

00:12.960 --> 00:17.760
But what they probably can tell you is who lives in a pineapple under the sea.

00:17.760 --> 00:22.320
Spongebob Squarepants is the most popular cartoon of my generation.

00:22.320 --> 00:24.480
And nothing else really even comes close.

00:30.000 --> 00:41.600
Here's a challenge. Try scrolling through your typical social media feeds

00:41.600 --> 00:45.680
and see how long you can go without seeing anything Spongebob related.

00:45.680 --> 00:47.520
There I am, Gary! There I am!

00:47.520 --> 00:53.200
You may find that it's pretty difficult because Spongebob is absolutely everywhere.

00:53.200 --> 00:58.640
People post Spongebob pictures from Tumblr to 4chan and everywhere in between.

00:58.640 --> 01:03.680
And even more impressively, almost all of the Spongebob related references,

01:03.680 --> 01:09.040
memes, and reaction images you see are based on the first three seasons of the series.

01:09.040 --> 01:15.520
A stretch of about 120 episodes that most people would classify as the golden age of Spongebob.

01:17.680 --> 01:20.960
If you look at Nickelodeon's programming schedule today,

01:20.960 --> 01:24.720
Spongebob Squarepants, a 19 year old cartoon,

01:24.720 --> 01:28.800
still receives more air time than any other show on the network.

01:28.800 --> 01:33.120
To put that in perspective, Futurama came out the same year as Spongebob.

01:33.120 --> 01:37.200
And since then, it ran for four seasons on Fox until it was cancelled.

01:37.200 --> 01:42.400
And then acquired by Cartoon Network where it aired as reruns on Adult Swim for three years.

01:42.400 --> 01:47.200
Then, starting in 2006, the series released four direct-to-DVD movies

01:47.200 --> 01:51.840
until 2010 when Comedy Central aired the series for two more seasons

01:51.840 --> 01:55.200
until it got cancelled for the final time in 2013.

01:55.200 --> 02:01.440
That is until 2014 when Futurama returned to Fox for a one-time crossover episode with The Simpsons.

02:01.440 --> 02:08.320
And since that point, the series has continued to air as reruns on Comedy Central and now sci-fi.

02:08.320 --> 02:11.840
And during that whole journey, over all that time,

02:11.840 --> 02:16.080
Spongebob has been continually broadcast on Nickelodeon.

02:16.080 --> 02:21.040
If you compare Spongebob to other children's cartoons released during the same time,

02:21.040 --> 02:24.000
nothing even comes close to its longevity.

02:24.000 --> 02:27.360
Rocket Power came out the same year as Spongebob on Nickelodeon.

02:30.720 --> 02:33.440
And it aged about as well as Polio.

02:33.440 --> 02:36.880
Even historically good cartoons from around the same time as Spongebob

02:36.880 --> 02:39.680
like Powerpuff Girls, Ed, Edd n Eddy, Jimmy Neutron,

02:39.680 --> 02:43.840
all these cartoons were off the air by 2010, but not Spongebob.

02:43.840 --> 02:48.640
And it should be no surprise why Nickelodeon still airs Spongebob as much as they do.

02:48.640 --> 02:55.680
Since Spongebob premiered in 1999, the show has generated over $13 billion in revenue

02:55.680 --> 02:57.680
from merchandising alone.

02:57.680 --> 02:59.360
And considering Viacom,

03:02.080 --> 03:07.840
Nickelodeon's parent company earns about $13 billion of revenue per year,

03:07.840 --> 03:16.240
you can infer that Spongebob alone has accounted for at least 5% of Viacom's total revenue since 1999.

03:16.240 --> 03:20.400
Keep in mind, that's not just 5% of Nickelodeon's revenue.

03:20.400 --> 03:26.160
That's 5% of the total revenue from every media property Viacom owns.

03:26.160 --> 03:30.800
So you're damn right they're gonna keep airing Spongebob for as long as they're in business.

03:31.360 --> 03:33.840
Spongebob just keeps going.

03:33.840 --> 03:38.160
And for as long as I can remember, Spongebob has always been popular.

03:38.160 --> 03:41.360
Everyone watched Spongebob when I was growing up in elementary school.

03:41.360 --> 03:46.080
And as everyone got older and passed the age when most people grow out of watching cartoons,

03:46.080 --> 03:48.720
Spongebob always seemed to stick around.

03:48.720 --> 03:51.520
You were never too old to make a Spongebob joke.

03:51.520 --> 03:53.920
Even during Spongebob's later seasons,

03:55.440 --> 03:59.840
it never really grew stale for me because I transitioned to watching YouTube poops

03:59.840 --> 04:01.440
of old Spongebob episodes.

04:01.440 --> 04:03.440
Listen Spongebob, fuck you!

04:03.440 --> 04:10.000
The first video in the history of my channel to reach a thousand views was a Spongebob YouTube poop.

04:10.000 --> 04:14.320
You could argue that the first three and a half years of this YouTube channel were built

04:14.320 --> 04:19.440
almost entirely from the popularity of me remixing episodes of Spongebob.

04:19.440 --> 04:24.720
Even today, new Spongebob YouTube poops continue to garner hundreds of thousands of views.

04:24.720 --> 04:27.040
And extending beyond YTP,

04:27.040 --> 04:31.520
Spongebob has become almost synonymous with meme culture on the internet today.

04:32.480 --> 04:36.240
From vines to reaction images to portrayed by Spongebob.

04:36.240 --> 04:41.680
Spongebob is, by far, the most popular cartoon character of this millennium.

04:41.680 --> 04:47.520
He has reached a status on par with the likes of Mickey Mouse, Bugs Bunny, and Homer Simpson.

04:47.520 --> 04:52.640
But by many measures, Spongebob is a more relevant character than any of them.

04:52.640 --> 04:58.000
Characters like Mickey Mouse are superficially popular due to branding and marketing.

04:58.000 --> 05:03.680
Kids today are certainly not watching Mickey Mouse cartoons or sharing Mickey Mouse memes.

05:03.680 --> 05:08.560
And the character has almost completely receded into the role of a corporate mascot.

05:09.280 --> 05:14.480
Principal Skinner, the happiest place on Earth is a registered Disneyland copyright.

05:14.480 --> 05:15.440
No, no!

05:15.440 --> 05:20.160
And it's heading for a great big lawsuit. You made a big mistake, Skinner.

05:20.160 --> 05:24.080
Well, so did you. You got an extreme beret mad.

05:25.440 --> 05:27.680
I spent the next three years in a POW camp.

05:30.560 --> 05:33.600
Characters like Homer Simpson are certainly iconic.

05:33.600 --> 05:37.120
However, they exist more as relics of a bygone era.

05:37.120 --> 05:40.880
Unlike Mickey Mouse, The Simpsons grew organically in popularity

05:40.880 --> 05:45.040
and became one of the most essential cultural elements of the 1990s.

05:45.040 --> 05:49.760
Quality shmality. If I had a TV show, I'd run that sucker into the ground.

05:49.760 --> 05:55.680
But it's 2018 now, and The Simpsons is not exactly the most cutting-edge programming anymore.

05:55.680 --> 06:01.200
Homer's legacy has already been decided, and the character has nothing new to bring to the table.

06:01.200 --> 06:04.560
SpongeBob not only rose to fame organically,

06:04.560 --> 06:09.360
but it continues to grow and evolve within our culture 19 years later.

06:21.520 --> 06:23.760
Now when you think of the new millennium,

06:24.560 --> 06:30.480
you think of an event so gigantic that it changes the course of history.

06:31.600 --> 06:35.200
You think of a dawning of a new era.

06:36.880 --> 06:39.360
Here's to another lousy millennium.

06:50.720 --> 06:51.840
Downward spiral.

06:52.560 --> 06:57.360
The term millennial gets thrown around a lot these days, and I don't really buy it.

06:57.360 --> 07:01.840
I think it's just a slippery blanket term invented by 40-year-old marketing people

07:01.840 --> 07:04.960
to describe young people who know how to use the internet.

07:04.960 --> 07:09.120
We're the first generation to have access to unlimited information.

07:09.120 --> 07:13.840
We don't fall for the same marketing tricks that corporations used on our parents,

07:13.840 --> 07:18.880
and companies can never figure out what we like because we don't know what we like.

07:18.880 --> 07:23.600
Actually, that's not exactly true. We know one thing we like, and that's SpongeBob.

07:23.600 --> 07:27.200
SpongeBob has somehow managed to become the most quintessential

07:27.200 --> 07:29.680
entertainment property among young people.

07:29.680 --> 07:35.680
This one show was able to crack the code of the most complex generation in history.

07:35.680 --> 07:38.400
In the entertainment industry, companies have invested

07:38.400 --> 07:41.680
millions in trying to come up with a character like SpongeBob.

07:41.680 --> 07:44.480
Every media company wants a SpongeBob,

07:44.480 --> 07:49.440
a character that becomes so popular that it practically prints money for the network.

07:49.440 --> 07:53.680
And ironically, SpongeBob wasn't created by a corporate think tank.

07:53.680 --> 07:59.760
He wasn't created by a fleet of overpaid marketing, public relations, and diversity specialists.

07:59.760 --> 08:06.240
The most popular children's cartoon of the 21st century was created by a marine biologist.

08:06.240 --> 08:12.560
I actually, for a while, studied marine science before animation.

08:12.560 --> 08:17.360
So when I started to think, well, if I were to do an animal show, what would I do?

08:17.360 --> 08:23.200
Not one about bunnies or dogs and cats, it would be about these sea animals that I really like,

08:23.200 --> 08:29.120
and somehow all that information sort of collided into one thing, SpongeBob.

08:35.600 --> 08:38.960
But have you ever wondered why SpongeBob is so popular?

08:38.960 --> 08:41.280
You're probably thinking it's the humor.

08:41.280 --> 08:46.480
Practically every reference to SpongeBob today exists within the context of comedy.

08:46.480 --> 08:51.520
I mean, SpongeBob has so many funny scenes that you could probably quote word for word.

08:51.520 --> 08:55.120
The style of comedy is just so random, zany, and unexpected.

08:55.680 --> 08:59.920
So is SpongeBob's humor really that much better than every other show?

09:00.560 --> 09:03.200
Well, no, not really actually.

09:03.200 --> 09:08.480
Plenty of cartoons have a similar style of pacing and comedy, and they aren't nearly as popular.

09:08.480 --> 09:13.600
Maybe you could argue that SpongeBob invented this style, and similar cartoons aren't as popular

09:13.680 --> 09:16.800
because the audience sees them as discount knockoffs.

09:17.440 --> 09:22.000
But even if that were true, the difference in popularity between something like The Simpsons

09:22.000 --> 09:27.360
and Family Guy is far less than the difference between SpongeBob and a show like Chowder.

09:27.360 --> 09:29.840
Something else is definitely going on here.

09:29.840 --> 09:34.000
So what exactly makes SpongeBob stick out so much from other cartoons?

09:34.000 --> 09:36.160
What makes SpongeBob so memorable?

09:36.160 --> 09:38.000
What makes SpongeBob click?

09:38.640 --> 09:41.840
Well, to find out, I decided to watch some old episodes.

09:41.840 --> 09:46.480
I couldn't quite figure it out until I saw this one scene from one episode.

09:46.480 --> 09:49.040
Then, suddenly, it all made sense.

09:49.040 --> 09:53.680
But before I get into what I discovered, let me first preface it with a simple question.

09:53.680 --> 09:57.360
Who is the most important character in SpongeBob?

09:57.360 --> 09:59.520
Now, you're probably looking at that and thinking,

09:59.520 --> 10:01.440
no shrimp, Barnacle Head.

10:01.440 --> 10:04.400
It's the character whose name is the title of the show.

10:05.120 --> 10:08.800
And yes, obviously SpongeBob is the face of SpongeBob,

10:08.800 --> 10:11.680
but is he really the most important character?

10:11.760 --> 10:14.960
Sure, he's an energetic and optimistic protagonist,

10:14.960 --> 10:19.120
but then again, so were a dozen other cartoon characters from the 2000s.

10:19.120 --> 10:24.000
SpongeBob alone wasn't enough to carry a show to transcendent popularity.

10:24.000 --> 10:25.200
So who was?

10:25.200 --> 10:30.320
Maybe you're thinking it's Patrick and his hilariously idiotic quotes and moments.

10:30.320 --> 10:35.600
You got it set to M for Minnie when it should be set to W for Wumbo.

10:35.600 --> 10:38.800
But once again, the dim-witted best friend character has showed up

10:38.800 --> 10:42.320
in a ton of other cartoons before and after SpongeBob.

10:42.320 --> 10:44.560
So Patrick is nothing special.

10:44.560 --> 10:48.080
Maybe you're thinking Mr. Krabs is the most important character

10:48.080 --> 10:52.000
and how his ruthless, penny-pitching greed is a brilliant commentary

10:52.000 --> 10:55.600
on how massive corporations are suffocating American society.

11:08.800 --> 11:15.760
The hammer of the people's will crashing through the windows of Mr. Krabs' house of servitude!

11:15.760 --> 11:18.720
But to be fair, you have to have a very high IQ

11:18.720 --> 11:23.600
to understand the deep anti-capitalistic themes of SpongeBob SquarePants.

11:23.600 --> 11:28.960
So Mr. Krabs probably isn't the character that gives the show the widest appeal.

11:28.960 --> 11:29.760
No, no, no.

11:29.760 --> 11:35.760
The most important character of SpongeBob isn't Mr. Krabs, Patrick, or even SpongeBob.

11:35.760 --> 11:42.240
The character that single-handedly makes SpongeBob work is Squidward Q. Tentacles.

11:42.240 --> 11:47.120
And it might not be obvious why, but when I watched this one very simple scene

11:47.120 --> 11:52.480
from the episode Dying for Pie, all the pieces of the puzzle suddenly came together.

11:52.480 --> 11:59.600
This short, basic clip with no dialogue represents precisely why SpongeBob is such a popular show.

12:05.760 --> 12:11.680
When I watched this scene as a kid, I was SpongeBob.

12:11.680 --> 12:15.200
But when I watched this scene today, I'm Squidward.

12:15.200 --> 12:18.560
You see, for kids that grew up watching SpongeBob,

12:18.560 --> 12:24.960
this show acts as a link, a connection, a time warp between our past and present selves.

12:24.960 --> 12:27.920
When we were kids, we all acted like SpongeBob.

12:27.920 --> 12:31.520
We were joyful, naive, enthusiastic, optimistic.

12:31.520 --> 12:34.400
Everything we did seemed like a new, fun adventure.

12:34.400 --> 12:38.080
Then, somewhere along the way, almost everyone turns into Squidward.

12:38.080 --> 12:44.080
Bland, cynical, pessimistic, trapped in the monotonous, never-ending routine of adult life.

12:47.360 --> 12:50.560
In case you've forgotten, here's how things work.

12:51.120 --> 12:57.440
I order the food, you cook the food, then the customer gets the food.

12:57.440 --> 12:59.840
We do that for 40 years, and then we die.

13:04.400 --> 13:07.440
Get back to work, Mr. Squidward.

13:07.440 --> 13:34.960
SpongeBob and Squidward represent a balanced dichotomy

13:34.960 --> 13:39.280
between the innocence of childhood and the cynicism of adulthood.

13:39.280 --> 13:41.520
Just think about Squidward's life in the show.

13:41.520 --> 13:43.200
It sure sucks, doesn't it?

13:43.200 --> 13:46.000
He works a minimum wage job as a cashier.

13:46.000 --> 13:50.400
He tries to find happiness in his only true passion of art and music,

13:50.400 --> 13:53.280
maintaining a sliver of hope that one day,

13:53.280 --> 13:58.080
he can quit his job at the Krusty Krab to become a commercially successful artist.

13:58.080 --> 14:02.640
But his lack of talent can only produce works that are mediocre at best.

14:02.640 --> 14:04.640
Society rejects his efforts.

14:04.640 --> 14:08.960
He's told time and time again that his passion projects are no good,

14:08.960 --> 14:13.840
leaving him doomed to toil in a dead-end career of fast food service.

14:13.840 --> 14:16.640
He believes he's better than everyone else,

14:16.640 --> 14:21.040
yet there he is, stuck in the same pen as the rest of the simpletons.

14:21.040 --> 14:22.880
He has abandoned his dreams.

14:22.880 --> 14:24.880
He knows he's not good enough.

14:24.880 --> 14:28.960
Life has defeated him, leaving him to stew in bitter contempt

14:28.960 --> 14:31.920
at how society has dealt him an unfair hand.

14:31.920 --> 14:37.760
Now tell me, does that description not represent almost every young adult of this generation?

14:37.760 --> 14:40.640
But a visit to the Krusty Krab makes everyone happy.

14:40.640 --> 14:43.360
And what could be better than serving up smiles?

14:45.200 --> 14:46.320
Being dead.

14:46.320 --> 14:50.160
It seems like most of us wish we could go back to being like SpongeBob.

14:50.160 --> 14:51.040
But do we really?

14:51.760 --> 14:55.280
If you strip away the bright colors, the wacky underwater setting,

14:55.280 --> 14:58.000
and all the weird anthropomorphic fish people,

14:58.000 --> 15:01.680
SpongeBob's life is just as depressing as Squidward's.

15:01.680 --> 15:06.000
He works the same dead-end job at the same fast food restaurant.

15:06.000 --> 15:10.480
He too has a passionate hobby that gets rejected by society.

15:10.480 --> 15:11.680
No one respects him.

15:11.680 --> 15:12.640
He's not tough.

15:12.640 --> 15:13.600
He's not strong.

15:13.600 --> 15:14.800
He's not cool.

15:14.800 --> 15:19.120
He can't pass his driver's license test no matter how many times he tries.

15:19.120 --> 15:22.640
SpongeBob's life is just as depressing as anybody else's.

15:22.640 --> 15:27.280
And yet, through all of that, he keeps his chin up and keeps on trying.

15:27.280 --> 15:29.920
SpongeBob is the anti-Squidward.

15:29.920 --> 15:32.960
And Squidward is the anti-SpongeBob.

15:32.960 --> 15:37.840
And their conflict is the essential thematic clash of not just the show,

15:37.840 --> 15:40.880
but the lives of the audience watching the show.

15:40.880 --> 15:44.720
Some of the best and most memorable SpongeBob episodes of all time

15:44.720 --> 15:49.120
are the ones where SpongeBob and Squidward are involved in the same adventure.

15:49.120 --> 15:50.720
Let's look at Idiot Box,

15:50.720 --> 15:55.200
where SpongeBob is able to derive more entertainment from a cardboard box

15:55.200 --> 15:58.320
than Squidward can from the television that accompanies it.

15:58.320 --> 16:03.520
Eventually, Squidward unlocks the same enjoyment by learning to use his imagination.

16:03.520 --> 16:08.320
If you look at the plots of many SpongeBob episodes involving SpongeBob and Squidward,

16:08.320 --> 16:10.240
you'll start to notice a pattern.

16:10.240 --> 16:13.360
Squidward and SpongeBob have to do some common tasks.

16:13.360 --> 16:18.080
Squidward's cynicism clashes with SpongeBob's enthusiasm until ultimately,

16:18.080 --> 16:21.040
SpongeBob's childlike optimism wins out.

16:21.040 --> 16:25.600
And Squidward gets to experience a rare moment of genuine happiness,

16:25.600 --> 16:28.800
only for his misery to quickly reset for future episodes.

16:29.520 --> 16:31.600
But what about when the opposite happens,

16:31.600 --> 16:35.440
when SpongeBob experiences a rare moment of sadness?

16:35.440 --> 16:40.080
Well, that happens in one of the most classic and popular episodes of all time,

16:40.080 --> 16:41.520
Pizza Delivery.

16:41.520 --> 16:45.200
It starts off as a typical SpongeBob and Squidward episode,

16:45.200 --> 16:48.640
with SpongeBob's optimistic spirit overcoming adversity

16:48.640 --> 16:51.840
and dragging Squidward along a marathon delivery route.

16:51.840 --> 16:54.560
For the whole journey, Squidward wants to quit.

16:54.560 --> 16:56.880
He doubts SpongeBob time and time again,

16:56.880 --> 17:00.080
and even tries to sabotage the delivery at one point.

17:00.080 --> 17:02.400
And yet, despite all of this,

17:02.400 --> 17:08.320
SpongeBob's antiquated survival guide manages to miraculously bring them to their destination.

17:08.320 --> 17:10.480
And then, after all that effort,

17:10.480 --> 17:14.080
this piece of f***ing fat f***ing c***

17:14.080 --> 17:16.560
slams the door in SpongeBob's face.

17:16.640 --> 17:22.560
This goddamn barnacle head is the most despicable villain in the history of fictional characters.

17:22.560 --> 17:26.080
A character so hated that they never ever brought him back.

17:26.080 --> 17:30.160
This guy should serve as a permanent reminder that you should never act this way

17:30.160 --> 17:32.320
to anyone who works in food service.

17:32.320 --> 17:34.080
Their lives are bad enough.

17:34.640 --> 17:39.360
But anyway, this barnacle head gives SpongeBob such a brutal dose of reality

17:39.360 --> 17:43.040
that it completely shatters his naive, optimistic bubble.

17:43.040 --> 17:47.600
And we get a rare moment where SpongeBob is genuinely dejected.

17:47.600 --> 17:50.640
This prompts one of the most memorable scenes in the whole series

17:50.640 --> 17:54.720
when Squidward puts his cynicism aside and sticks up for his friend.

17:55.440 --> 17:58.160
It's a truly gratifying and heartwarming moment,

17:58.160 --> 18:02.000
and it really makes you wonder about the true depth of Squidward's character.

18:02.000 --> 18:05.920
Once again, if you really pay attention to some of these SpongeBob episodes,

18:05.920 --> 18:10.560
you'll start to notice that Squidward often learns a lesson or changes his attitude.

18:10.560 --> 18:15.600
In many cases, Squidward is as much of a protagonist as SpongeBob.

18:15.600 --> 18:18.640
This idea gets fully realized in Band Geeks,

18:18.640 --> 18:23.280
an episode that many fans regard as the greatest SpongeBob episode ever.

18:23.280 --> 18:26.240
This is an episode that hands Squidward the reins.

18:26.240 --> 18:32.320
He finally gets an opportunity to follow his dream and make it big as a successful artist.

18:32.320 --> 18:36.560
And just like every other one of his attempts at chasing his aspirations,

18:36.560 --> 18:39.680
it begins to look like a complete failure.

18:39.680 --> 18:43.040
But then, just when all hope seems lost,

18:43.040 --> 18:46.320
SpongeBob helps the entire town band together

18:46.320 --> 18:51.040
and they deliver the best musical performance in the history of the Bubble Bowl.

18:51.040 --> 18:54.800
And in the end, Squidward is hoisted into the air,

18:54.800 --> 18:56.560
triumphant at last,

18:56.560 --> 18:59.840
finally achieving his dream of becoming a successful artist.

19:00.400 --> 19:04.560
I don't care how long the series lasts or whatever the final episode is,

19:04.560 --> 19:10.880
because this moment right here is the true spiritual series finale of SpongeBob SquarePants.

19:10.880 --> 19:15.760
And in my humble opinion, it's the most iconic moment in the history of the series.

19:16.400 --> 19:18.560
But why should we care about any of this?

19:18.560 --> 19:20.240
SpongeBob isn't real.

19:20.240 --> 19:22.080
Bikini Bottom isn't real.

19:22.640 --> 19:25.280
Nothing about SpongeBob is real.

19:25.280 --> 19:26.640
And at the end of the day,

19:26.640 --> 19:31.920
SpongeBob is just a series of colorful images strung together for 11 minutes a pop,

19:32.000 --> 19:35.280
a TV show that hasn't even been good since 2004.

19:35.840 --> 19:37.280
But that's the thing, though.

19:37.280 --> 19:39.760
Why did SpongeBob stop being good?

19:39.760 --> 19:46.080
Why do all of the show's most memorable moments seem to only come from those vaunted first three seasons?

19:46.080 --> 19:50.080
For most fans, everything else has been simply mediocre.

19:50.080 --> 19:56.000
Numerous essays have been produced attempting to explain SpongeBob's decline in quality from season four onward,

19:56.000 --> 20:02.080
citing reasons from creator Stephen Hillenburg's departure to production changes to creative burnout.

20:02.080 --> 20:04.960
All of these explanations seem to have one thing in common.

20:04.960 --> 20:09.520
They all have a shared sense that new SpongeBob is missing something.

20:09.520 --> 20:15.440
And for me, that thing is the essential dichotomy between SpongeBob and Squidward.

20:15.440 --> 20:19.520
In the early seasons, SpongeBob was an adult with childlike qualities.

20:19.520 --> 20:25.520
However, if you pay attention to his characterization in later seasons, he's basically just a child.

20:25.520 --> 20:28.800
Squidward hasn't changed that much, but it doesn't matter.

20:28.800 --> 20:34.320
Because simply changing SpongeBob was enough to throw their entire character dynamic out of whack.

20:34.320 --> 20:36.960
SpongeBob and Squidward used to be foils.

20:36.960 --> 20:41.280
They were both just a couple of dudes in the same crappy situation.

20:41.280 --> 20:45.120
But their outlook of that situation is what made them distinct.

20:45.120 --> 20:51.520
The comedy and fun of SpongeBob came from how SpongeBob and Squidward saw the world differently.

20:51.520 --> 20:57.200
And when you take SpongeBob and turn him into a brainless child who cries over McDonald's toys,

20:57.200 --> 20:59.440
you completely destroy this balance.

20:59.440 --> 21:03.680
You no longer have a dichotomy of perspectives towards adult life.

21:03.680 --> 21:09.360
All you have at this point is Squidward basically babysitting kid SpongeBob for 11 minutes.

21:09.360 --> 21:12.800
Rather than having SpongeBob act as a foil for Squidward,

21:12.800 --> 21:17.120
you make SpongeBob antagonize Squidward through obnoxious antics.

21:17.120 --> 21:20.560
This kind of stuff may have worked for Bugs Bunny and Elmer Fudd,

21:20.560 --> 21:24.640
but it's just not the kind of stuff that made us love SpongeBob.

21:24.640 --> 21:29.200
And yeah, obviously there's more to SpongeBob than just SpongeBob and Squidward.

21:29.200 --> 21:34.080
But the same theme applies to basically everything that's wrong with the later seasons of the show.

21:35.120 --> 21:38.560
SpongeBob started off as something truly unique and special.

21:38.560 --> 21:43.040
And in just a few seasons, they turned it into just another cartoon for children.

21:43.040 --> 21:50.160
The reason SpongeBob became mediocre was because they removed the spirit of what connected the show to adults.

21:50.240 --> 21:53.360
And sure, the later seasons of SpongeBob aren't that good.

21:53.360 --> 22:00.240
But you shouldn't let that detract from what the show managed to accomplish during those first magical 120 episodes.

22:00.240 --> 22:05.200
There are millions of people out there who grew up watching SpongeBob and are in their 20s now.

22:05.200 --> 22:09.120
People who probably stopped watching cartoons over a decade ago,

22:09.120 --> 22:12.160
but still get a kick out of SpongeBob references.

22:12.160 --> 22:15.600
SpongeBob managed to define an entire generation.

22:15.600 --> 22:19.360
And there are very few other television shows that can make that claim.

22:19.360 --> 22:24.720
I don't think there's a single other show that truly captures the essence of whatever a millennial is.

22:24.720 --> 22:30.960
A generation who has been raised with dreams of grandeur only to fall into a wasteland of mediocrity.

22:30.960 --> 22:35.120
A collection of young adults who desperately want to believe that they're unique,

22:35.120 --> 22:37.520
that they're talented, that they matter.

22:37.520 --> 22:43.200
Despite finding themselves wasting away in a dead-end job lining the pockets of some rich a-hole.

22:43.200 --> 22:48.160
The sad reality is that most of the people my age are a generation of Squidwards.

22:48.160 --> 22:50.400
People who feel like they deserve better.

22:50.400 --> 22:55.600
People who feel like society has inhibited them from fulfilling their true potential.

22:55.600 --> 23:02.480
People who have grown cynical and jaded and depressed because they believe that the world has screwed them.

23:02.480 --> 23:05.120
But I don't see why it has to be that way.

23:05.120 --> 23:08.560
I don't see why people can't try to be more like SpongeBob.

23:08.560 --> 23:14.400
I think when we grow up a lot of us are so desperate to act older and be mature and cool and edgy.

23:14.400 --> 23:18.480
But I think somewhere along the way a lot of us lose sight of something important.

23:18.480 --> 23:22.560
We are all born with an inherent sense of childlike wonder.

23:22.560 --> 23:25.600
When we're kids everything is just so much more interesting.

23:25.600 --> 23:29.760
We're naturally curious. We're eager to discover the world and interact with it.

23:29.760 --> 23:34.480
We have hyperactive imaginations. We draw pictures. We write stories.

23:34.480 --> 23:40.880
We create things that have intrinsic value to us because we take satisfaction in creating them.

23:40.880 --> 23:43.760
And eventually there comes a time when we just stop.

23:43.760 --> 23:48.080
The world stops being fun. We stop exploring. We stop imagining.

23:48.080 --> 23:51.760
Everything becomes dull and repetitive and uninspired.

23:51.760 --> 23:54.000
But why do we do this to ourselves?

23:54.000 --> 23:58.000
We suddenly jettison our capacity for creativity and imagination.

23:58.000 --> 24:02.000
And for what? To fit in better with other sad boring adults?

24:02.000 --> 24:08.240
I bet that everybody watching this can remember a moment in their lives when someone has told you to grow up.

24:08.240 --> 24:12.480
And made you feel ashamed for acting even the least bit childish.

24:12.480 --> 24:18.320
It's all too common for our society to stigmatize people who demonstrate signs of immaturity.

24:18.320 --> 24:22.640
But as far as I'm concerned, as long as you're a good person and you pull your own weight,

24:22.640 --> 24:25.920
what difference does it make if you occasionally act like a kid?

24:25.920 --> 24:33.600
Being an adult blows. You have taxes, insurance, rent payments, lawn care, litigation, hair loss,

24:33.600 --> 24:39.360
weight gain, erectile dysfunction, and on top of all of that you're expected to be boring too.

24:40.000 --> 24:47.360
So excuse me if I'm unwilling to abandon my childlike sense of wonderment in exchange for those fantastic perks.

24:47.360 --> 24:51.840
You shouldn't have to buy into this nebulous perceived notion of maturity.

24:51.840 --> 24:56.800
As a matter of fact, most people don't buy into it if they're being honest with themselves.

24:56.800 --> 25:01.360
When you look at the comments of any YouTube video about something more than five years old,

25:01.360 --> 25:05.760
you'll see people nostalgically fawning about the good old days.

25:05.760 --> 25:09.840
It turns out everyone's in a race to grow up until they finally get to be grown-ups.

25:09.840 --> 25:12.240
Then, all of a sudden, they want to be young again.

25:12.800 --> 25:17.600
Some of these people have such a strong desire to return to the past because they feel like

25:17.600 --> 25:23.520
everything has changed for the worse. When realistically, the world hasn't changed for the worse.

25:23.520 --> 25:30.160
Your outlook has. You've become a Squidward. And remember, no one wants to be a Squidward.

25:30.160 --> 25:33.120
And everyone should want to be more like SpongeBob.

25:33.120 --> 25:37.840
I don't care if you're the most jaded, cynical, edgy dude on the planet.

25:37.840 --> 25:42.160
You should still try to be like SpongeBob because SpongeBob has something that the

25:42.160 --> 25:46.480
Squidwards of the world will never have. And that's genuine happiness.

25:47.120 --> 25:51.600
I guess what I'm trying to say with all of this is that you only get to be a kid for so long.

25:51.600 --> 25:57.200
Enjoy it. And even if you think you're too old, you shouldn't let that stop yourself from enjoying

25:57.200 --> 26:02.080
the same stuff you did when you were a kid. You shouldn't worry about those people telling you

26:02.080 --> 26:08.240
to act your age. Because that's just another way of telling you to be boring. So don't be boring.

26:08.240 --> 26:13.280
Go out and have some fun like a kid. Draw a picture. Write a story. Sing a song.

26:13.280 --> 26:18.640
Watch some cartoons. And if you happen to watch one about a talking sponge who lives in a pineapple

26:18.640 --> 26:24.080
under the sea, you can stop and appreciate it. Because there will never ever be another cartoon

26:24.080 --> 26:48.400
like it. It's not about winning. It's about fun. Thank you for your patronage.
