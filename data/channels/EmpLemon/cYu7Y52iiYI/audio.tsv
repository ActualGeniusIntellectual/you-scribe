0	6480	You know, the average American probably can't tell you who lives in 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue.
6480	11760	Hello, Mr. Donald Trump. I am here to inform you that I am placing you under citizen's arrest.
11760	12960	What are you, morons?
12960	17760	But what they probably can tell you is who lives in a pineapple under the sea.
17760	22320	Spongebob Squarepants is the most popular cartoon of my generation.
22320	24480	And nothing else really even comes close.
30000	41600	Here's a challenge. Try scrolling through your typical social media feeds
41600	45680	and see how long you can go without seeing anything Spongebob related.
45680	47520	There I am, Gary! There I am!
47520	53200	You may find that it's pretty difficult because Spongebob is absolutely everywhere.
53200	58640	People post Spongebob pictures from Tumblr to 4chan and everywhere in between.
58640	63680	And even more impressively, almost all of the Spongebob related references,
63680	69040	memes, and reaction images you see are based on the first three seasons of the series.
69040	75520	A stretch of about 120 episodes that most people would classify as the golden age of Spongebob.
77680	80960	If you look at Nickelodeon's programming schedule today,
80960	84720	Spongebob Squarepants, a 19 year old cartoon,
84720	88800	still receives more air time than any other show on the network.
88800	93120	To put that in perspective, Futurama came out the same year as Spongebob.
93120	97200	And since then, it ran for four seasons on Fox until it was cancelled.
97200	102400	And then acquired by Cartoon Network where it aired as reruns on Adult Swim for three years.
102400	107200	Then, starting in 2006, the series released four direct-to-DVD movies
107200	111840	until 2010 when Comedy Central aired the series for two more seasons
111840	115200	until it got cancelled for the final time in 2013.
115200	121440	That is until 2014 when Futurama returned to Fox for a one-time crossover episode with The Simpsons.
121440	128320	And since that point, the series has continued to air as reruns on Comedy Central and now sci-fi.
128320	131840	And during that whole journey, over all that time,
131840	136080	Spongebob has been continually broadcast on Nickelodeon.
136080	141040	If you compare Spongebob to other children's cartoons released during the same time,
141040	144000	nothing even comes close to its longevity.
144000	147360	Rocket Power came out the same year as Spongebob on Nickelodeon.
150720	153440	And it aged about as well as Polio.
153440	156880	Even historically good cartoons from around the same time as Spongebob
156880	159680	like Powerpuff Girls, Ed, Edd n Eddy, Jimmy Neutron,
159680	163840	all these cartoons were off the air by 2010, but not Spongebob.
163840	168640	And it should be no surprise why Nickelodeon still airs Spongebob as much as they do.
168640	175680	Since Spongebob premiered in 1999, the show has generated over $13 billion in revenue
175680	177680	from merchandising alone.
177680	179360	And considering Viacom,
182080	187840	Nickelodeon's parent company earns about $13 billion of revenue per year,
187840	196240	you can infer that Spongebob alone has accounted for at least 5% of Viacom's total revenue since 1999.
196240	200400	Keep in mind, that's not just 5% of Nickelodeon's revenue.
200400	206160	That's 5% of the total revenue from every media property Viacom owns.
206160	210800	So you're damn right they're gonna keep airing Spongebob for as long as they're in business.
211360	213840	Spongebob just keeps going.
213840	218160	And for as long as I can remember, Spongebob has always been popular.
218160	221360	Everyone watched Spongebob when I was growing up in elementary school.
221360	226080	And as everyone got older and passed the age when most people grow out of watching cartoons,
226080	228720	Spongebob always seemed to stick around.
228720	231520	You were never too old to make a Spongebob joke.
231520	233920	Even during Spongebob's later seasons,
235440	239840	it never really grew stale for me because I transitioned to watching YouTube poops
239840	241440	of old Spongebob episodes.
241440	243440	Listen Spongebob, fuck you!
243440	250000	The first video in the history of my channel to reach a thousand views was a Spongebob YouTube poop.
250000	254320	You could argue that the first three and a half years of this YouTube channel were built
254320	259440	almost entirely from the popularity of me remixing episodes of Spongebob.
259440	264720	Even today, new Spongebob YouTube poops continue to garner hundreds of thousands of views.
264720	267040	And extending beyond YTP,
267040	271520	Spongebob has become almost synonymous with meme culture on the internet today.
272480	276240	From vines to reaction images to portrayed by Spongebob.
276240	281680	Spongebob is, by far, the most popular cartoon character of this millennium.
281680	287520	He has reached a status on par with the likes of Mickey Mouse, Bugs Bunny, and Homer Simpson.
287520	292640	But by many measures, Spongebob is a more relevant character than any of them.
292640	298000	Characters like Mickey Mouse are superficially popular due to branding and marketing.
298000	303680	Kids today are certainly not watching Mickey Mouse cartoons or sharing Mickey Mouse memes.
303680	308560	And the character has almost completely receded into the role of a corporate mascot.
309280	314480	Principal Skinner, the happiest place on Earth is a registered Disneyland copyright.
314480	315440	No, no!
315440	320160	And it's heading for a great big lawsuit. You made a big mistake, Skinner.
320160	324080	Well, so did you. You got an extreme beret mad.
325440	327680	I spent the next three years in a POW camp.
330560	333600	Characters like Homer Simpson are certainly iconic.
333600	337120	However, they exist more as relics of a bygone era.
337120	340880	Unlike Mickey Mouse, The Simpsons grew organically in popularity
340880	345040	and became one of the most essential cultural elements of the 1990s.
345040	349760	Quality shmality. If I had a TV show, I'd run that sucker into the ground.
349760	355680	But it's 2018 now, and The Simpsons is not exactly the most cutting-edge programming anymore.
355680	361200	Homer's legacy has already been decided, and the character has nothing new to bring to the table.
361200	364560	SpongeBob not only rose to fame organically,
364560	369360	but it continues to grow and evolve within our culture 19 years later.
381520	383760	Now when you think of the new millennium,
384560	390480	you think of an event so gigantic that it changes the course of history.
391600	395200	You think of a dawning of a new era.
396880	399360	Here's to another lousy millennium.
410720	411840	Downward spiral.
412560	417360	The term millennial gets thrown around a lot these days, and I don't really buy it.
417360	421840	I think it's just a slippery blanket term invented by 40-year-old marketing people
421840	424960	to describe young people who know how to use the internet.
424960	429120	We're the first generation to have access to unlimited information.
429120	433840	We don't fall for the same marketing tricks that corporations used on our parents,
433840	438880	and companies can never figure out what we like because we don't know what we like.
438880	443600	Actually, that's not exactly true. We know one thing we like, and that's SpongeBob.
443600	447200	SpongeBob has somehow managed to become the most quintessential
447200	449680	entertainment property among young people.
449680	455680	This one show was able to crack the code of the most complex generation in history.
455680	458400	In the entertainment industry, companies have invested
458400	461680	millions in trying to come up with a character like SpongeBob.
461680	464480	Every media company wants a SpongeBob,
464480	469440	a character that becomes so popular that it practically prints money for the network.
469440	473680	And ironically, SpongeBob wasn't created by a corporate think tank.
473680	479760	He wasn't created by a fleet of overpaid marketing, public relations, and diversity specialists.
479760	486240	The most popular children's cartoon of the 21st century was created by a marine biologist.
486240	492560	I actually, for a while, studied marine science before animation.
492560	497360	So when I started to think, well, if I were to do an animal show, what would I do?
497360	503200	Not one about bunnies or dogs and cats, it would be about these sea animals that I really like,
503200	509120	and somehow all that information sort of collided into one thing, SpongeBob.
515600	518960	But have you ever wondered why SpongeBob is so popular?
518960	521280	You're probably thinking it's the humor.
521280	526480	Practically every reference to SpongeBob today exists within the context of comedy.
526480	531520	I mean, SpongeBob has so many funny scenes that you could probably quote word for word.
531520	535120	The style of comedy is just so random, zany, and unexpected.
535680	539920	So is SpongeBob's humor really that much better than every other show?
540560	543200	Well, no, not really actually.
543200	548480	Plenty of cartoons have a similar style of pacing and comedy, and they aren't nearly as popular.
548480	553600	Maybe you could argue that SpongeBob invented this style, and similar cartoons aren't as popular
553680	556800	because the audience sees them as discount knockoffs.
557440	562000	But even if that were true, the difference in popularity between something like The Simpsons
562000	567360	and Family Guy is far less than the difference between SpongeBob and a show like Chowder.
567360	569840	Something else is definitely going on here.
569840	574000	So what exactly makes SpongeBob stick out so much from other cartoons?
574000	576160	What makes SpongeBob so memorable?
576160	578000	What makes SpongeBob click?
578640	581840	Well, to find out, I decided to watch some old episodes.
581840	586480	I couldn't quite figure it out until I saw this one scene from one episode.
586480	589040	Then, suddenly, it all made sense.
589040	593680	But before I get into what I discovered, let me first preface it with a simple question.
593680	597360	Who is the most important character in SpongeBob?
597360	599520	Now, you're probably looking at that and thinking,
599520	601440	no shrimp, Barnacle Head.
601440	604400	It's the character whose name is the title of the show.
605120	608800	And yes, obviously SpongeBob is the face of SpongeBob,
608800	611680	but is he really the most important character?
611760	614960	Sure, he's an energetic and optimistic protagonist,
614960	619120	but then again, so were a dozen other cartoon characters from the 2000s.
619120	624000	SpongeBob alone wasn't enough to carry a show to transcendent popularity.
624000	625200	So who was?
625200	630320	Maybe you're thinking it's Patrick and his hilariously idiotic quotes and moments.
630320	635600	You got it set to M for Minnie when it should be set to W for Wumbo.
635600	638800	But once again, the dim-witted best friend character has showed up
638800	642320	in a ton of other cartoons before and after SpongeBob.
642320	644560	So Patrick is nothing special.
644560	648080	Maybe you're thinking Mr. Krabs is the most important character
648080	652000	and how his ruthless, penny-pitching greed is a brilliant commentary
652000	655600	on how massive corporations are suffocating American society.
668800	675760	The hammer of the people's will crashing through the windows of Mr. Krabs' house of servitude!
675760	678720	But to be fair, you have to have a very high IQ
678720	683600	to understand the deep anti-capitalistic themes of SpongeBob SquarePants.
683600	688960	So Mr. Krabs probably isn't the character that gives the show the widest appeal.
688960	689760	No, no, no.
689760	695760	The most important character of SpongeBob isn't Mr. Krabs, Patrick, or even SpongeBob.
695760	702240	The character that single-handedly makes SpongeBob work is Squidward Q. Tentacles.
702240	707120	And it might not be obvious why, but when I watched this one very simple scene
707120	712480	from the episode Dying for Pie, all the pieces of the puzzle suddenly came together.
712480	719600	This short, basic clip with no dialogue represents precisely why SpongeBob is such a popular show.
725760	731680	When I watched this scene as a kid, I was SpongeBob.
731680	735200	But when I watched this scene today, I'm Squidward.
735200	738560	You see, for kids that grew up watching SpongeBob,
738560	744960	this show acts as a link, a connection, a time warp between our past and present selves.
744960	747920	When we were kids, we all acted like SpongeBob.
747920	751520	We were joyful, naive, enthusiastic, optimistic.
751520	754400	Everything we did seemed like a new, fun adventure.
754400	758080	Then, somewhere along the way, almost everyone turns into Squidward.
758080	764080	Bland, cynical, pessimistic, trapped in the monotonous, never-ending routine of adult life.
767360	770560	In case you've forgotten, here's how things work.
771120	777440	I order the food, you cook the food, then the customer gets the food.
777440	779840	We do that for 40 years, and then we die.
784400	787440	Get back to work, Mr. Squidward.
787440	814960	SpongeBob and Squidward represent a balanced dichotomy
814960	819280	between the innocence of childhood and the cynicism of adulthood.
819280	821520	Just think about Squidward's life in the show.
821520	823200	It sure sucks, doesn't it?
823200	826000	He works a minimum wage job as a cashier.
826000	830400	He tries to find happiness in his only true passion of art and music,
830400	833280	maintaining a sliver of hope that one day,
833280	838080	he can quit his job at the Krusty Krab to become a commercially successful artist.
838080	842640	But his lack of talent can only produce works that are mediocre at best.
842640	844640	Society rejects his efforts.
844640	848960	He's told time and time again that his passion projects are no good,
848960	853840	leaving him doomed to toil in a dead-end career of fast food service.
853840	856640	He believes he's better than everyone else,
856640	861040	yet there he is, stuck in the same pen as the rest of the simpletons.
861040	862880	He has abandoned his dreams.
862880	864880	He knows he's not good enough.
864880	868960	Life has defeated him, leaving him to stew in bitter contempt
868960	871920	at how society has dealt him an unfair hand.
871920	877760	Now tell me, does that description not represent almost every young adult of this generation?
877760	880640	But a visit to the Krusty Krab makes everyone happy.
880640	883360	And what could be better than serving up smiles?
885200	886320	Being dead.
886320	890160	It seems like most of us wish we could go back to being like SpongeBob.
890160	891040	But do we really?
891760	895280	If you strip away the bright colors, the wacky underwater setting,
895280	898000	and all the weird anthropomorphic fish people,
898000	901680	SpongeBob's life is just as depressing as Squidward's.
901680	906000	He works the same dead-end job at the same fast food restaurant.
906000	910480	He too has a passionate hobby that gets rejected by society.
910480	911680	No one respects him.
911680	912640	He's not tough.
912640	913600	He's not strong.
913600	914800	He's not cool.
914800	919120	He can't pass his driver's license test no matter how many times he tries.
919120	922640	SpongeBob's life is just as depressing as anybody else's.
922640	927280	And yet, through all of that, he keeps his chin up and keeps on trying.
927280	929920	SpongeBob is the anti-Squidward.
929920	932960	And Squidward is the anti-SpongeBob.
932960	937840	And their conflict is the essential thematic clash of not just the show,
937840	940880	but the lives of the audience watching the show.
940880	944720	Some of the best and most memorable SpongeBob episodes of all time
944720	949120	are the ones where SpongeBob and Squidward are involved in the same adventure.
949120	950720	Let's look at Idiot Box,
950720	955200	where SpongeBob is able to derive more entertainment from a cardboard box
955200	958320	than Squidward can from the television that accompanies it.
958320	963520	Eventually, Squidward unlocks the same enjoyment by learning to use his imagination.
963520	968320	If you look at the plots of many SpongeBob episodes involving SpongeBob and Squidward,
968320	970240	you'll start to notice a pattern.
970240	973360	Squidward and SpongeBob have to do some common tasks.
973360	978080	Squidward's cynicism clashes with SpongeBob's enthusiasm until ultimately,
978080	981040	SpongeBob's childlike optimism wins out.
981040	985600	And Squidward gets to experience a rare moment of genuine happiness,
985600	988800	only for his misery to quickly reset for future episodes.
989520	991600	But what about when the opposite happens,
991600	995440	when SpongeBob experiences a rare moment of sadness?
995440	1000080	Well, that happens in one of the most classic and popular episodes of all time,
1000080	1001520	Pizza Delivery.
1001520	1005200	It starts off as a typical SpongeBob and Squidward episode,
1005200	1008640	with SpongeBob's optimistic spirit overcoming adversity
1008640	1011840	and dragging Squidward along a marathon delivery route.
1011840	1014560	For the whole journey, Squidward wants to quit.
1014560	1016880	He doubts SpongeBob time and time again,
1016880	1020080	and even tries to sabotage the delivery at one point.
1020080	1022400	And yet, despite all of this,
1022400	1028320	SpongeBob's antiquated survival guide manages to miraculously bring them to their destination.
1028320	1030480	And then, after all that effort,
1030480	1034080	this piece of f***ing fat f***ing c***
1034080	1036560	slams the door in SpongeBob's face.
1036640	1042560	This goddamn barnacle head is the most despicable villain in the history of fictional characters.
1042560	1046080	A character so hated that they never ever brought him back.
1046080	1050160	This guy should serve as a permanent reminder that you should never act this way
1050160	1052320	to anyone who works in food service.
1052320	1054080	Their lives are bad enough.
1054640	1059360	But anyway, this barnacle head gives SpongeBob such a brutal dose of reality
1059360	1063040	that it completely shatters his naive, optimistic bubble.
1063040	1067600	And we get a rare moment where SpongeBob is genuinely dejected.
1067600	1070640	This prompts one of the most memorable scenes in the whole series
1070640	1074720	when Squidward puts his cynicism aside and sticks up for his friend.
1075440	1078160	It's a truly gratifying and heartwarming moment,
1078160	1082000	and it really makes you wonder about the true depth of Squidward's character.
1082000	1085920	Once again, if you really pay attention to some of these SpongeBob episodes,
1085920	1090560	you'll start to notice that Squidward often learns a lesson or changes his attitude.
1090560	1095600	In many cases, Squidward is as much of a protagonist as SpongeBob.
1095600	1098640	This idea gets fully realized in Band Geeks,
1098640	1103280	an episode that many fans regard as the greatest SpongeBob episode ever.
1103280	1106240	This is an episode that hands Squidward the reins.
1106240	1112320	He finally gets an opportunity to follow his dream and make it big as a successful artist.
1112320	1116560	And just like every other one of his attempts at chasing his aspirations,
1116560	1119680	it begins to look like a complete failure.
1119680	1123040	But then, just when all hope seems lost,
1123040	1126320	SpongeBob helps the entire town band together
1126320	1131040	and they deliver the best musical performance in the history of the Bubble Bowl.
1131040	1134800	And in the end, Squidward is hoisted into the air,
1134800	1136560	triumphant at last,
1136560	1139840	finally achieving his dream of becoming a successful artist.
1140400	1144560	I don't care how long the series lasts or whatever the final episode is,
1144560	1150880	because this moment right here is the true spiritual series finale of SpongeBob SquarePants.
1150880	1155760	And in my humble opinion, it's the most iconic moment in the history of the series.
1156400	1158560	But why should we care about any of this?
1158560	1160240	SpongeBob isn't real.
1160240	1162080	Bikini Bottom isn't real.
1162640	1165280	Nothing about SpongeBob is real.
1165280	1166640	And at the end of the day,
1166640	1171920	SpongeBob is just a series of colorful images strung together for 11 minutes a pop,
1172000	1175280	a TV show that hasn't even been good since 2004.
1175840	1177280	But that's the thing, though.
1177280	1179760	Why did SpongeBob stop being good?
1179760	1186080	Why do all of the show's most memorable moments seem to only come from those vaunted first three seasons?
1186080	1190080	For most fans, everything else has been simply mediocre.
1190080	1196000	Numerous essays have been produced attempting to explain SpongeBob's decline in quality from season four onward,
1196000	1202080	citing reasons from creator Stephen Hillenburg's departure to production changes to creative burnout.
1202080	1204960	All of these explanations seem to have one thing in common.
1204960	1209520	They all have a shared sense that new SpongeBob is missing something.
1209520	1215440	And for me, that thing is the essential dichotomy between SpongeBob and Squidward.
1215440	1219520	In the early seasons, SpongeBob was an adult with childlike qualities.
1219520	1225520	However, if you pay attention to his characterization in later seasons, he's basically just a child.
1225520	1228800	Squidward hasn't changed that much, but it doesn't matter.
1228800	1234320	Because simply changing SpongeBob was enough to throw their entire character dynamic out of whack.
1234320	1236960	SpongeBob and Squidward used to be foils.
1236960	1241280	They were both just a couple of dudes in the same crappy situation.
1241280	1245120	But their outlook of that situation is what made them distinct.
1245120	1251520	The comedy and fun of SpongeBob came from how SpongeBob and Squidward saw the world differently.
1251520	1257200	And when you take SpongeBob and turn him into a brainless child who cries over McDonald's toys,
1257200	1259440	you completely destroy this balance.
1259440	1263680	You no longer have a dichotomy of perspectives towards adult life.
1263680	1269360	All you have at this point is Squidward basically babysitting kid SpongeBob for 11 minutes.
1269360	1272800	Rather than having SpongeBob act as a foil for Squidward,
1272800	1277120	you make SpongeBob antagonize Squidward through obnoxious antics.
1277120	1280560	This kind of stuff may have worked for Bugs Bunny and Elmer Fudd,
1280560	1284640	but it's just not the kind of stuff that made us love SpongeBob.
1284640	1289200	And yeah, obviously there's more to SpongeBob than just SpongeBob and Squidward.
1289200	1294080	But the same theme applies to basically everything that's wrong with the later seasons of the show.
1295120	1298560	SpongeBob started off as something truly unique and special.
1298560	1303040	And in just a few seasons, they turned it into just another cartoon for children.
1303040	1310160	The reason SpongeBob became mediocre was because they removed the spirit of what connected the show to adults.
1310240	1313360	And sure, the later seasons of SpongeBob aren't that good.
1313360	1320240	But you shouldn't let that detract from what the show managed to accomplish during those first magical 120 episodes.
1320240	1325200	There are millions of people out there who grew up watching SpongeBob and are in their 20s now.
1325200	1329120	People who probably stopped watching cartoons over a decade ago,
1329120	1332160	but still get a kick out of SpongeBob references.
1332160	1335600	SpongeBob managed to define an entire generation.
1335600	1339360	And there are very few other television shows that can make that claim.
1339360	1344720	I don't think there's a single other show that truly captures the essence of whatever a millennial is.
1344720	1350960	A generation who has been raised with dreams of grandeur only to fall into a wasteland of mediocrity.
1350960	1355120	A collection of young adults who desperately want to believe that they're unique,
1355120	1357520	that they're talented, that they matter.
1357520	1363200	Despite finding themselves wasting away in a dead-end job lining the pockets of some rich a-hole.
1363200	1368160	The sad reality is that most of the people my age are a generation of Squidwards.
1368160	1370400	People who feel like they deserve better.
1370400	1375600	People who feel like society has inhibited them from fulfilling their true potential.
1375600	1382480	People who have grown cynical and jaded and depressed because they believe that the world has screwed them.
1382480	1385120	But I don't see why it has to be that way.
1385120	1388560	I don't see why people can't try to be more like SpongeBob.
1388560	1394400	I think when we grow up a lot of us are so desperate to act older and be mature and cool and edgy.
1394400	1398480	But I think somewhere along the way a lot of us lose sight of something important.
1398480	1402560	We are all born with an inherent sense of childlike wonder.
1402560	1405600	When we're kids everything is just so much more interesting.
1405600	1409760	We're naturally curious. We're eager to discover the world and interact with it.
1409760	1414480	We have hyperactive imaginations. We draw pictures. We write stories.
1414480	1420880	We create things that have intrinsic value to us because we take satisfaction in creating them.
1420880	1423760	And eventually there comes a time when we just stop.
1423760	1428080	The world stops being fun. We stop exploring. We stop imagining.
1428080	1431760	Everything becomes dull and repetitive and uninspired.
1431760	1434000	But why do we do this to ourselves?
1434000	1438000	We suddenly jettison our capacity for creativity and imagination.
1438000	1442000	And for what? To fit in better with other sad boring adults?
1442000	1448240	I bet that everybody watching this can remember a moment in their lives when someone has told you to grow up.
1448240	1452480	And made you feel ashamed for acting even the least bit childish.
1452480	1458320	It's all too common for our society to stigmatize people who demonstrate signs of immaturity.
1458320	1462640	But as far as I'm concerned, as long as you're a good person and you pull your own weight,
1462640	1465920	what difference does it make if you occasionally act like a kid?
1465920	1473600	Being an adult blows. You have taxes, insurance, rent payments, lawn care, litigation, hair loss,
1473600	1479360	weight gain, erectile dysfunction, and on top of all of that you're expected to be boring too.
1480000	1487360	So excuse me if I'm unwilling to abandon my childlike sense of wonderment in exchange for those fantastic perks.
1487360	1491840	You shouldn't have to buy into this nebulous perceived notion of maturity.
1491840	1496800	As a matter of fact, most people don't buy into it if they're being honest with themselves.
1496800	1501360	When you look at the comments of any YouTube video about something more than five years old,
1501360	1505760	you'll see people nostalgically fawning about the good old days.
1505760	1509840	It turns out everyone's in a race to grow up until they finally get to be grown-ups.
1509840	1512240	Then, all of a sudden, they want to be young again.
1512800	1517600	Some of these people have such a strong desire to return to the past because they feel like
1517600	1523520	everything has changed for the worse. When realistically, the world hasn't changed for the worse.
1523520	1530160	Your outlook has. You've become a Squidward. And remember, no one wants to be a Squidward.
1530160	1533120	And everyone should want to be more like SpongeBob.
1533120	1537840	I don't care if you're the most jaded, cynical, edgy dude on the planet.
1537840	1542160	You should still try to be like SpongeBob because SpongeBob has something that the
1542160	1546480	Squidwards of the world will never have. And that's genuine happiness.
1547120	1551600	I guess what I'm trying to say with all of this is that you only get to be a kid for so long.
1551600	1557200	Enjoy it. And even if you think you're too old, you shouldn't let that stop yourself from enjoying
1557200	1562080	the same stuff you did when you were a kid. You shouldn't worry about those people telling you
1562080	1568240	to act your age. Because that's just another way of telling you to be boring. So don't be boring.
1568240	1573280	Go out and have some fun like a kid. Draw a picture. Write a story. Sing a song.
1573280	1578640	Watch some cartoons. And if you happen to watch one about a talking sponge who lives in a pineapple
1578640	1584080	under the sea, you can stop and appreciate it. Because there will never ever be another cartoon
1584080	1608400	like it. It's not about winning. It's about fun. Thank you for your patronage.
