1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,480
You know, the average American probably can't tell you who lives in 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue.

2
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:11,760
Hello, Mr. Donald Trump. I am here to inform you that I am placing you under citizen's arrest.

3
00:00:11,760 --> 00:00:12,960
What are you, morons?

4
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:17,760
But what they probably can tell you is who lives in a pineapple under the sea.

5
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:22,320
Spongebob Squarepants is the most popular cartoon of my generation.

6
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:24,480
And nothing else really even comes close.

7
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:41,600
Here's a challenge. Try scrolling through your typical social media feeds

8
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:45,680
and see how long you can go without seeing anything Spongebob related.

9
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:47,520
There I am, Gary! There I am!

10
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:53,200
You may find that it's pretty difficult because Spongebob is absolutely everywhere.

11
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:58,640
People post Spongebob pictures from Tumblr to 4chan and everywhere in between.

12
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:03,680
And even more impressively, almost all of the Spongebob related references,

13
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:09,040
memes, and reaction images you see are based on the first three seasons of the series.

14
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:15,520
A stretch of about 120 episodes that most people would classify as the golden age of Spongebob.

15
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:20,960
If you look at Nickelodeon's programming schedule today,

16
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:24,720
Spongebob Squarepants, a 19 year old cartoon,

17
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:28,800
still receives more air time than any other show on the network.

18
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:33,120
To put that in perspective, Futurama came out the same year as Spongebob.

19
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:37,200
And since then, it ran for four seasons on Fox until it was cancelled.

20
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:42,400
And then acquired by Cartoon Network where it aired as reruns on Adult Swim for three years.

21
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:47,200
Then, starting in 2006, the series released four direct-to-DVD movies

22
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:51,840
until 2010 when Comedy Central aired the series for two more seasons

23
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:55,200
until it got cancelled for the final time in 2013.

24
00:01:55,200 --> 00:02:01,440
That is until 2014 when Futurama returned to Fox for a one-time crossover episode with The Simpsons.

25
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:08,320
And since that point, the series has continued to air as reruns on Comedy Central and now sci-fi.

26
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:11,840
And during that whole journey, over all that time,

27
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:16,080
Spongebob has been continually broadcast on Nickelodeon.

28
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:21,040
If you compare Spongebob to other children's cartoons released during the same time,

29
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:24,000
nothing even comes close to its longevity.

30
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,360
Rocket Power came out the same year as Spongebob on Nickelodeon.

31
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:33,440
And it aged about as well as Polio.

32
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:36,880
Even historically good cartoons from around the same time as Spongebob

33
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:39,680
like Powerpuff Girls, Ed, Edd n Eddy, Jimmy Neutron,

34
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:43,840
all these cartoons were off the air by 2010, but not Spongebob.

35
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:48,640
And it should be no surprise why Nickelodeon still airs Spongebob as much as they do.

36
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:55,680
Since Spongebob premiered in 1999, the show has generated over $13 billion in revenue

37
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:57,680
from merchandising alone.

38
00:02:57,680 --> 00:02:59,360
And considering Viacom,

39
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:07,840
Nickelodeon's parent company earns about $13 billion of revenue per year,

40
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:16,240
you can infer that Spongebob alone has accounted for at least 5% of Viacom's total revenue since 1999.

41
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:20,400
Keep in mind, that's not just 5% of Nickelodeon's revenue.

42
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:26,160
That's 5% of the total revenue from every media property Viacom owns.

43
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:30,800
So you're damn right they're gonna keep airing Spongebob for as long as they're in business.

44
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:33,840
Spongebob just keeps going.

45
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:38,160
And for as long as I can remember, Spongebob has always been popular.

46
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:41,360
Everyone watched Spongebob when I was growing up in elementary school.

47
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:46,080
And as everyone got older and passed the age when most people grow out of watching cartoons,

48
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:48,720
Spongebob always seemed to stick around.

49
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:51,520
You were never too old to make a Spongebob joke.

50
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:53,920
Even during Spongebob's later seasons,

51
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:59,840
it never really grew stale for me because I transitioned to watching YouTube poops

52
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:01,440
of old Spongebob episodes.

53
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:03,440
Listen Spongebob, fuck you!

54
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:10,000
The first video in the history of my channel to reach a thousand views was a Spongebob YouTube poop.

55
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:14,320
You could argue that the first three and a half years of this YouTube channel were built

56
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:19,440
almost entirely from the popularity of me remixing episodes of Spongebob.

57
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:24,720
Even today, new Spongebob YouTube poops continue to garner hundreds of thousands of views.

58
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:27,040
And extending beyond YTP,

59
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:31,520
Spongebob has become almost synonymous with meme culture on the internet today.

60
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:36,240
From vines to reaction images to portrayed by Spongebob.

61
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:41,680
Spongebob is, by far, the most popular cartoon character of this millennium.

62
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:47,520
He has reached a status on par with the likes of Mickey Mouse, Bugs Bunny, and Homer Simpson.

63
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:52,640
But by many measures, Spongebob is a more relevant character than any of them.

64
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:58,000
Characters like Mickey Mouse are superficially popular due to branding and marketing.

65
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:03,680
Kids today are certainly not watching Mickey Mouse cartoons or sharing Mickey Mouse memes.

66
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:08,560
And the character has almost completely receded into the role of a corporate mascot.

67
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:14,480
Principal Skinner, the happiest place on Earth is a registered Disneyland copyright.

68
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:15,440
No, no!

69
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:20,160
And it's heading for a great big lawsuit. You made a big mistake, Skinner.

70
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:24,080
Well, so did you. You got an extreme beret mad.

71
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:27,680
I spent the next three years in a POW camp.

72
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:33,600
Characters like Homer Simpson are certainly iconic.

73
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:37,120
However, they exist more as relics of a bygone era.

74
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:40,880
Unlike Mickey Mouse, The Simpsons grew organically in popularity

75
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:45,040
and became one of the most essential cultural elements of the 1990s.

76
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:49,760
Quality shmality. If I had a TV show, I'd run that sucker into the ground.

77
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:55,680
But it's 2018 now, and The Simpsons is not exactly the most cutting-edge programming anymore.

78
00:05:55,680 --> 00:06:01,200
Homer's legacy has already been decided, and the character has nothing new to bring to the table.

79
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:04,560
SpongeBob not only rose to fame organically,

80
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:09,360
but it continues to grow and evolve within our culture 19 years later.

81
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:23,760
Now when you think of the new millennium,

82
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:30,480
you think of an event so gigantic that it changes the course of history.

83
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:35,200
You think of a dawning of a new era.

84
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:39,360
Here's to another lousy millennium.

85
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:51,840
Downward spiral.

86
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:57,360
The term millennial gets thrown around a lot these days, and I don't really buy it.

87
00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:01,840
I think it's just a slippery blanket term invented by 40-year-old marketing people

88
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:04,960
to describe young people who know how to use the internet.

89
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:09,120
We're the first generation to have access to unlimited information.

90
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:13,840
We don't fall for the same marketing tricks that corporations used on our parents,

91
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:18,880
and companies can never figure out what we like because we don't know what we like.

92
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:23,600
Actually, that's not exactly true. We know one thing we like, and that's SpongeBob.

93
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:27,200
SpongeBob has somehow managed to become the most quintessential

94
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:29,680
entertainment property among young people.

95
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:35,680
This one show was able to crack the code of the most complex generation in history.

96
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:38,400
In the entertainment industry, companies have invested

97
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:41,680
millions in trying to come up with a character like SpongeBob.

98
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:44,480
Every media company wants a SpongeBob,

99
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:49,440
a character that becomes so popular that it practically prints money for the network.

100
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:53,680
And ironically, SpongeBob wasn't created by a corporate think tank.

101
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:59,760
He wasn't created by a fleet of overpaid marketing, public relations, and diversity specialists.

102
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:06,240
The most popular children's cartoon of the 21st century was created by a marine biologist.

103
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:12,560
I actually, for a while, studied marine science before animation.

104
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:17,360
So when I started to think, well, if I were to do an animal show, what would I do?

105
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:23,200
Not one about bunnies or dogs and cats, it would be about these sea animals that I really like,

106
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:29,120
and somehow all that information sort of collided into one thing, SpongeBob.

107
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:38,960
But have you ever wondered why SpongeBob is so popular?

108
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:41,280
You're probably thinking it's the humor.

109
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:46,480
Practically every reference to SpongeBob today exists within the context of comedy.

110
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:51,520
I mean, SpongeBob has so many funny scenes that you could probably quote word for word.

111
00:08:51,520 --> 00:08:55,120
The style of comedy is just so random, zany, and unexpected.

112
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:59,920
So is SpongeBob's humor really that much better than every other show?

113
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:03,200
Well, no, not really actually.

114
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:08,480
Plenty of cartoons have a similar style of pacing and comedy, and they aren't nearly as popular.

115
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:13,600
Maybe you could argue that SpongeBob invented this style, and similar cartoons aren't as popular

116
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:16,800
because the audience sees them as discount knockoffs.

117
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:22,000
But even if that were true, the difference in popularity between something like The Simpsons

118
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:27,360
and Family Guy is far less than the difference between SpongeBob and a show like Chowder.

119
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:29,840
Something else is definitely going on here.

120
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:34,000
So what exactly makes SpongeBob stick out so much from other cartoons?

121
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,160
What makes SpongeBob so memorable?

122
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:38,000
What makes SpongeBob click?

123
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:41,840
Well, to find out, I decided to watch some old episodes.

124
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:46,480
I couldn't quite figure it out until I saw this one scene from one episode.

125
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:49,040
Then, suddenly, it all made sense.

126
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:53,680
But before I get into what I discovered, let me first preface it with a simple question.

127
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:57,360
Who is the most important character in SpongeBob?

128
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:59,520
Now, you're probably looking at that and thinking,

129
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:01,440
no shrimp, Barnacle Head.

130
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:04,400
It's the character whose name is the title of the show.

131
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:08,800
And yes, obviously SpongeBob is the face of SpongeBob,

132
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:11,680
but is he really the most important character?

133
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:14,960
Sure, he's an energetic and optimistic protagonist,

134
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:19,120
but then again, so were a dozen other cartoon characters from the 2000s.

135
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:24,000
SpongeBob alone wasn't enough to carry a show to transcendent popularity.

136
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,200
So who was?

137
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:30,320
Maybe you're thinking it's Patrick and his hilariously idiotic quotes and moments.

138
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:35,600
You got it set to M for Minnie when it should be set to W for Wumbo.

139
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:38,800
But once again, the dim-witted best friend character has showed up

140
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:42,320
in a ton of other cartoons before and after SpongeBob.

141
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:44,560
So Patrick is nothing special.

142
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:48,080
Maybe you're thinking Mr. Krabs is the most important character

143
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:52,000
and how his ruthless, penny-pitching greed is a brilliant commentary

144
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:55,600
on how massive corporations are suffocating American society.

145
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:15,760
The hammer of the people's will crashing through the windows of Mr. Krabs' house of servitude!

146
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:18,720
But to be fair, you have to have a very high IQ

147
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:23,600
to understand the deep anti-capitalistic themes of SpongeBob SquarePants.

148
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:28,960
So Mr. Krabs probably isn't the character that gives the show the widest appeal.

149
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:29,760
No, no, no.

150
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:35,760
The most important character of SpongeBob isn't Mr. Krabs, Patrick, or even SpongeBob.

151
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:42,240
The character that single-handedly makes SpongeBob work is Squidward Q. Tentacles.

152
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:47,120
And it might not be obvious why, but when I watched this one very simple scene

153
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:52,480
from the episode Dying for Pie, all the pieces of the puzzle suddenly came together.

154
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:59,600
This short, basic clip with no dialogue represents precisely why SpongeBob is such a popular show.

155
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:11,680
When I watched this scene as a kid, I was SpongeBob.

156
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:15,200
But when I watched this scene today, I'm Squidward.

157
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:18,560
You see, for kids that grew up watching SpongeBob,

158
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:24,960
this show acts as a link, a connection, a time warp between our past and present selves.

159
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:27,920
When we were kids, we all acted like SpongeBob.

160
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:31,520
We were joyful, naive, enthusiastic, optimistic.

161
00:12:31,520 --> 00:12:34,400
Everything we did seemed like a new, fun adventure.

162
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:38,080
Then, somewhere along the way, almost everyone turns into Squidward.

163
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:44,080
Bland, cynical, pessimistic, trapped in the monotonous, never-ending routine of adult life.

164
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:50,560
In case you've forgotten, here's how things work.

165
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:57,440
I order the food, you cook the food, then the customer gets the food.

166
00:12:57,440 --> 00:12:59,840
We do that for 40 years, and then we die.

167
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:07,440
Get back to work, Mr. Squidward.

168
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:34,960
SpongeBob and Squidward represent a balanced dichotomy

169
00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:39,280
between the innocence of childhood and the cynicism of adulthood.

170
00:13:39,280 --> 00:13:41,520
Just think about Squidward's life in the show.

171
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:43,200
It sure sucks, doesn't it?

172
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:46,000
He works a minimum wage job as a cashier.

173
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:50,400
He tries to find happiness in his only true passion of art and music,

174
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:53,280
maintaining a sliver of hope that one day,

175
00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:58,080
he can quit his job at the Krusty Krab to become a commercially successful artist.

176
00:13:58,080 --> 00:14:02,640
But his lack of talent can only produce works that are mediocre at best.

177
00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:04,640
Society rejects his efforts.

178
00:14:04,640 --> 00:14:08,960
He's told time and time again that his passion projects are no good,

179
00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:13,840
leaving him doomed to toil in a dead-end career of fast food service.

180
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:16,640
He believes he's better than everyone else,

181
00:14:16,640 --> 00:14:21,040
yet there he is, stuck in the same pen as the rest of the simpletons.

182
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:22,880
He has abandoned his dreams.

183
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:24,880
He knows he's not good enough.

184
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:28,960
Life has defeated him, leaving him to stew in bitter contempt

185
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:31,920
at how society has dealt him an unfair hand.

186
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:37,760
Now tell me, does that description not represent almost every young adult of this generation?

187
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:40,640
But a visit to the Krusty Krab makes everyone happy.

188
00:14:40,640 --> 00:14:43,360
And what could be better than serving up smiles?

189
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:46,320
Being dead.

190
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:50,160
It seems like most of us wish we could go back to being like SpongeBob.

191
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:51,040
But do we really?

192
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:55,280
If you strip away the bright colors, the wacky underwater setting,

193
00:14:55,280 --> 00:14:58,000
and all the weird anthropomorphic fish people,

194
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:01,680
SpongeBob's life is just as depressing as Squidward's.

195
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:06,000
He works the same dead-end job at the same fast food restaurant.

196
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:10,480
He too has a passionate hobby that gets rejected by society.

197
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:11,680
No one respects him.

198
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:12,640
He's not tough.

199
00:15:12,640 --> 00:15:13,600
He's not strong.

200
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:14,800
He's not cool.

201
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:19,120
He can't pass his driver's license test no matter how many times he tries.

202
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:22,640
SpongeBob's life is just as depressing as anybody else's.

203
00:15:22,640 --> 00:15:27,280
And yet, through all of that, he keeps his chin up and keeps on trying.

204
00:15:27,280 --> 00:15:29,920
SpongeBob is the anti-Squidward.

205
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:32,960
And Squidward is the anti-SpongeBob.

206
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:37,840
And their conflict is the essential thematic clash of not just the show,

207
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:40,880
but the lives of the audience watching the show.

208
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:44,720
Some of the best and most memorable SpongeBob episodes of all time

209
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:49,120
are the ones where SpongeBob and Squidward are involved in the same adventure.

210
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:50,720
Let's look at Idiot Box,

211
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:55,200
where SpongeBob is able to derive more entertainment from a cardboard box

212
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:58,320
than Squidward can from the television that accompanies it.

213
00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:03,520
Eventually, Squidward unlocks the same enjoyment by learning to use his imagination.

214
00:16:03,520 --> 00:16:08,320
If you look at the plots of many SpongeBob episodes involving SpongeBob and Squidward,

215
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:10,240
you'll start to notice a pattern.

216
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:13,360
Squidward and SpongeBob have to do some common tasks.

217
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:18,080
Squidward's cynicism clashes with SpongeBob's enthusiasm until ultimately,

218
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:21,040
SpongeBob's childlike optimism wins out.

219
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:25,600
And Squidward gets to experience a rare moment of genuine happiness,

220
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:28,800
only for his misery to quickly reset for future episodes.

221
00:16:29,520 --> 00:16:31,600
But what about when the opposite happens,

222
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:35,440
when SpongeBob experiences a rare moment of sadness?

223
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:40,080
Well, that happens in one of the most classic and popular episodes of all time,

224
00:16:40,080 --> 00:16:41,520
Pizza Delivery.

225
00:16:41,520 --> 00:16:45,200
It starts off as a typical SpongeBob and Squidward episode,

226
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:48,640
with SpongeBob's optimistic spirit overcoming adversity

227
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:51,840
and dragging Squidward along a marathon delivery route.

228
00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:54,560
For the whole journey, Squidward wants to quit.

229
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:56,880
He doubts SpongeBob time and time again,

230
00:16:56,880 --> 00:17:00,080
and even tries to sabotage the delivery at one point.

231
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:02,400
And yet, despite all of this,

232
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:08,320
SpongeBob's antiquated survival guide manages to miraculously bring them to their destination.

233
00:17:08,320 --> 00:17:10,480
And then, after all that effort,

234
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:14,080
this piece of f***ing fat f***ing c***

235
00:17:14,080 --> 00:17:16,560
slams the door in SpongeBob's face.

236
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:22,560
This goddamn barnacle head is the most despicable villain in the history of fictional characters.

237
00:17:22,560 --> 00:17:26,080
A character so hated that they never ever brought him back.

238
00:17:26,080 --> 00:17:30,160
This guy should serve as a permanent reminder that you should never act this way

239
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:32,320
to anyone who works in food service.

240
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:34,080
Their lives are bad enough.

241
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:39,360
But anyway, this barnacle head gives SpongeBob such a brutal dose of reality

242
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:43,040
that it completely shatters his naive, optimistic bubble.

243
00:17:43,040 --> 00:17:47,600
And we get a rare moment where SpongeBob is genuinely dejected.

244
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:50,640
This prompts one of the most memorable scenes in the whole series

245
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:54,720
when Squidward puts his cynicism aside and sticks up for his friend.

246
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:58,160
It's a truly gratifying and heartwarming moment,

247
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:02,000
and it really makes you wonder about the true depth of Squidward's character.

248
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:05,920
Once again, if you really pay attention to some of these SpongeBob episodes,

249
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:10,560
you'll start to notice that Squidward often learns a lesson or changes his attitude.

250
00:18:10,560 --> 00:18:15,600
In many cases, Squidward is as much of a protagonist as SpongeBob.

251
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:18,640
This idea gets fully realized in Band Geeks,

252
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:23,280
an episode that many fans regard as the greatest SpongeBob episode ever.

253
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:26,240
This is an episode that hands Squidward the reins.

254
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:32,320
He finally gets an opportunity to follow his dream and make it big as a successful artist.

255
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:36,560
And just like every other one of his attempts at chasing his aspirations,

256
00:18:36,560 --> 00:18:39,680
it begins to look like a complete failure.

257
00:18:39,680 --> 00:18:43,040
But then, just when all hope seems lost,

258
00:18:43,040 --> 00:18:46,320
SpongeBob helps the entire town band together

259
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:51,040
and they deliver the best musical performance in the history of the Bubble Bowl.

260
00:18:51,040 --> 00:18:54,800
And in the end, Squidward is hoisted into the air,

261
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:56,560
triumphant at last,

262
00:18:56,560 --> 00:18:59,840
finally achieving his dream of becoming a successful artist.

263
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:04,560
I don't care how long the series lasts or whatever the final episode is,

264
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:10,880
because this moment right here is the true spiritual series finale of SpongeBob SquarePants.

265
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:15,760
And in my humble opinion, it's the most iconic moment in the history of the series.

266
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:18,560
But why should we care about any of this?

267
00:19:18,560 --> 00:19:20,240
SpongeBob isn't real.

268
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:22,080
Bikini Bottom isn't real.

269
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:25,280
Nothing about SpongeBob is real.

270
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:26,640
And at the end of the day,

271
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:31,920
SpongeBob is just a series of colorful images strung together for 11 minutes a pop,

272
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:35,280
a TV show that hasn't even been good since 2004.

273
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:37,280
But that's the thing, though.

274
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:39,760
Why did SpongeBob stop being good?

275
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:46,080
Why do all of the show's most memorable moments seem to only come from those vaunted first three seasons?

276
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:50,080
For most fans, everything else has been simply mediocre.

277
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:56,000
Numerous essays have been produced attempting to explain SpongeBob's decline in quality from season four onward,

278
00:19:56,000 --> 00:20:02,080
citing reasons from creator Stephen Hillenburg's departure to production changes to creative burnout.

279
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:04,960
All of these explanations seem to have one thing in common.

280
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:09,520
They all have a shared sense that new SpongeBob is missing something.

281
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:15,440
And for me, that thing is the essential dichotomy between SpongeBob and Squidward.

282
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:19,520
In the early seasons, SpongeBob was an adult with childlike qualities.

283
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:25,520
However, if you pay attention to his characterization in later seasons, he's basically just a child.

284
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:28,800
Squidward hasn't changed that much, but it doesn't matter.

285
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:34,320
Because simply changing SpongeBob was enough to throw their entire character dynamic out of whack.

286
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:36,960
SpongeBob and Squidward used to be foils.

287
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:41,280
They were both just a couple of dudes in the same crappy situation.

288
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:45,120
But their outlook of that situation is what made them distinct.

289
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:51,520
The comedy and fun of SpongeBob came from how SpongeBob and Squidward saw the world differently.

290
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:57,200
And when you take SpongeBob and turn him into a brainless child who cries over McDonald's toys,

291
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:59,440
you completely destroy this balance.

292
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:03,680
You no longer have a dichotomy of perspectives towards adult life.

293
00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:09,360
All you have at this point is Squidward basically babysitting kid SpongeBob for 11 minutes.

294
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:12,800
Rather than having SpongeBob act as a foil for Squidward,

295
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:17,120
you make SpongeBob antagonize Squidward through obnoxious antics.

296
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:20,560
This kind of stuff may have worked for Bugs Bunny and Elmer Fudd,

297
00:21:20,560 --> 00:21:24,640
but it's just not the kind of stuff that made us love SpongeBob.

298
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:29,200
And yeah, obviously there's more to SpongeBob than just SpongeBob and Squidward.

299
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:34,080
But the same theme applies to basically everything that's wrong with the later seasons of the show.

300
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:38,560
SpongeBob started off as something truly unique and special.

301
00:21:38,560 --> 00:21:43,040
And in just a few seasons, they turned it into just another cartoon for children.

302
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:50,160
The reason SpongeBob became mediocre was because they removed the spirit of what connected the show to adults.

303
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:53,360
And sure, the later seasons of SpongeBob aren't that good.

304
00:21:53,360 --> 00:22:00,240
But you shouldn't let that detract from what the show managed to accomplish during those first magical 120 episodes.

305
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:05,200
There are millions of people out there who grew up watching SpongeBob and are in their 20s now.

306
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:09,120
People who probably stopped watching cartoons over a decade ago,

307
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:12,160
but still get a kick out of SpongeBob references.

308
00:22:12,160 --> 00:22:15,600
SpongeBob managed to define an entire generation.

309
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:19,360
And there are very few other television shows that can make that claim.

310
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:24,720
I don't think there's a single other show that truly captures the essence of whatever a millennial is.

311
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:30,960
A generation who has been raised with dreams of grandeur only to fall into a wasteland of mediocrity.

312
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:35,120
A collection of young adults who desperately want to believe that they're unique,

313
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:37,520
that they're talented, that they matter.

314
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:43,200
Despite finding themselves wasting away in a dead-end job lining the pockets of some rich a-hole.

315
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:48,160
The sad reality is that most of the people my age are a generation of Squidwards.

316
00:22:48,160 --> 00:22:50,400
People who feel like they deserve better.

317
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:55,600
People who feel like society has inhibited them from fulfilling their true potential.

318
00:22:55,600 --> 00:23:02,480
People who have grown cynical and jaded and depressed because they believe that the world has screwed them.

319
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:05,120
But I don't see why it has to be that way.

320
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:08,560
I don't see why people can't try to be more like SpongeBob.

321
00:23:08,560 --> 00:23:14,400
I think when we grow up a lot of us are so desperate to act older and be mature and cool and edgy.

322
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:18,480
But I think somewhere along the way a lot of us lose sight of something important.

323
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:22,560
We are all born with an inherent sense of childlike wonder.

324
00:23:22,560 --> 00:23:25,600
When we're kids everything is just so much more interesting.

325
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:29,760
We're naturally curious. We're eager to discover the world and interact with it.

326
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:34,480
We have hyperactive imaginations. We draw pictures. We write stories.

327
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:40,880
We create things that have intrinsic value to us because we take satisfaction in creating them.

328
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:43,760
And eventually there comes a time when we just stop.

329
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:48,080
The world stops being fun. We stop exploring. We stop imagining.

330
00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:51,760
Everything becomes dull and repetitive and uninspired.

331
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:54,000
But why do we do this to ourselves?

332
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:58,000
We suddenly jettison our capacity for creativity and imagination.

333
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:02,000
And for what? To fit in better with other sad boring adults?

334
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:08,240
I bet that everybody watching this can remember a moment in their lives when someone has told you to grow up.

335
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:12,480
And made you feel ashamed for acting even the least bit childish.

336
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:18,320
It's all too common for our society to stigmatize people who demonstrate signs of immaturity.

337
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:22,640
But as far as I'm concerned, as long as you're a good person and you pull your own weight,

338
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:25,920
what difference does it make if you occasionally act like a kid?

339
00:24:25,920 --> 00:24:33,600
Being an adult blows. You have taxes, insurance, rent payments, lawn care, litigation, hair loss,

340
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:39,360
weight gain, erectile dysfunction, and on top of all of that you're expected to be boring too.

341
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:47,360
So excuse me if I'm unwilling to abandon my childlike sense of wonderment in exchange for those fantastic perks.

342
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:51,840
You shouldn't have to buy into this nebulous perceived notion of maturity.

343
00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:56,800
As a matter of fact, most people don't buy into it if they're being honest with themselves.

344
00:24:56,800 --> 00:25:01,360
When you look at the comments of any YouTube video about something more than five years old,

345
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:05,760
you'll see people nostalgically fawning about the good old days.

346
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:09,840
It turns out everyone's in a race to grow up until they finally get to be grown-ups.

347
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:12,240
Then, all of a sudden, they want to be young again.

348
00:25:12,800 --> 00:25:17,600
Some of these people have such a strong desire to return to the past because they feel like

349
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:23,520
everything has changed for the worse. When realistically, the world hasn't changed for the worse.

350
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:30,160
Your outlook has. You've become a Squidward. And remember, no one wants to be a Squidward.

351
00:25:30,160 --> 00:25:33,120
And everyone should want to be more like SpongeBob.

352
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:37,840
I don't care if you're the most jaded, cynical, edgy dude on the planet.

353
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:42,160
You should still try to be like SpongeBob because SpongeBob has something that the

354
00:25:42,160 --> 00:25:46,480
Squidwards of the world will never have. And that's genuine happiness.

355
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:51,600
I guess what I'm trying to say with all of this is that you only get to be a kid for so long.

356
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:57,200
Enjoy it. And even if you think you're too old, you shouldn't let that stop yourself from enjoying

357
00:25:57,200 --> 00:26:02,080
the same stuff you did when you were a kid. You shouldn't worry about those people telling you

358
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:08,240
to act your age. Because that's just another way of telling you to be boring. So don't be boring.

359
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:13,280
Go out and have some fun like a kid. Draw a picture. Write a story. Sing a song.

360
00:26:13,280 --> 00:26:18,640
Watch some cartoons. And if you happen to watch one about a talking sponge who lives in a pineapple

361
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:24,080
under the sea, you can stop and appreciate it. Because there will never ever be another cartoon

362
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:48,400
like it. It's not about winning. It's about fun. Thank you for your patronage.
