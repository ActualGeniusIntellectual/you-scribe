1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,200
And now it's time for Silly Songs with Ant Lemon, the part of the show where Ant Lemon

2
00:00:06,200 --> 00:00:08,920
comes out and sings a silly song.

3
00:00:08,920 --> 00:00:13,120
So without further ado, Silly Songs with Ant Lemon.

4
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:25,120
In the eye of the storm, in the skies a big cyclone,

5
00:00:25,120 --> 00:00:34,600
floods the place, floods the state, yet another hurricane.

6
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:43,480
Boiling seas, summer stink, beneath the waves the houses sink.

7
00:00:43,480 --> 00:00:55,040
When you think you'll survive, it goes category five.

8
00:00:55,040 --> 00:01:04,280
Blacker Ma, won't you come and wash away my state.

9
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:16,120
Blacker Ma, won't you come, won't you come, won't you come.

10
00:01:16,120 --> 00:01:25,040
From the swamps to the shores, board your windows and your doors,

11
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:34,600
time has come to repent for all our past mistakes.

12
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:43,480
Disney World, Maimi Beach, where the crowds once sought to reach,

13
00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:55,080
Ocean Man claims the land, no one swims like you anymore.

14
00:01:55,080 --> 00:02:04,320
Blacker Ma, won't you come and wash away my state.

15
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:13,520
Blacker Ma, won't you come, won't you come.

16
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:22,800
Blacker Ma, won't you come and wash away my state.

17
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:29,680
Blacker Ma, won't you come, won't you come.

18
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:31,240
Blacker Ma!
