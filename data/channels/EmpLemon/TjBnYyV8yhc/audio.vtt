00:00.000 --> 00:06.200
And now it's time for Silly Songs with Ant Lemon, the part of the show where Ant Lemon

00:06.200 --> 00:08.920
comes out and sings a silly song.

00:08.920 --> 00:13.120
So without further ado, Silly Songs with Ant Lemon.

00:13.120 --> 00:25.120
In the eye of the storm, in the skies a big cyclone,

00:25.120 --> 00:34.600
floods the place, floods the state, yet another hurricane.

00:34.600 --> 00:43.480
Boiling seas, summer stink, beneath the waves the houses sink.

00:43.480 --> 00:55.040
When you think you'll survive, it goes category five.

00:55.040 --> 01:04.280
Blacker Ma, won't you come and wash away my state.

01:04.280 --> 01:16.120
Blacker Ma, won't you come, won't you come, won't you come.

01:16.120 --> 01:25.040
From the swamps to the shores, board your windows and your doors,

01:25.040 --> 01:34.600
time has come to repent for all our past mistakes.

01:34.600 --> 01:43.480
Disney World, Maimi Beach, where the crowds once sought to reach,

01:43.480 --> 01:55.080
Ocean Man claims the land, no one swims like you anymore.

01:55.080 --> 02:04.320
Blacker Ma, won't you come and wash away my state.

02:04.320 --> 02:13.520
Blacker Ma, won't you come, won't you come.

02:13.520 --> 02:22.800
Blacker Ma, won't you come and wash away my state.

02:22.800 --> 02:29.680
Blacker Ma, won't you come, won't you come.

02:29.680 --> 02:31.240
Blacker Ma!
