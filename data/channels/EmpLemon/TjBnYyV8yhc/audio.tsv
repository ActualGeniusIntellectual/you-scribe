0	6200	And now it's time for Silly Songs with Ant Lemon, the part of the show where Ant Lemon
6200	8920	comes out and sings a silly song.
8920	13120	So without further ado, Silly Songs with Ant Lemon.
13120	25120	In the eye of the storm, in the skies a big cyclone,
25120	34600	floods the place, floods the state, yet another hurricane.
34600	43480	Boiling seas, summer stink, beneath the waves the houses sink.
43480	55040	When you think you'll survive, it goes category five.
55040	64280	Blacker Ma, won't you come and wash away my state.
64280	76120	Blacker Ma, won't you come, won't you come, won't you come.
76120	85040	From the swamps to the shores, board your windows and your doors,
85040	94600	time has come to repent for all our past mistakes.
94600	103480	Disney World, Maimi Beach, where the crowds once sought to reach,
103480	115080	Ocean Man claims the land, no one swims like you anymore.
115080	124320	Blacker Ma, won't you come and wash away my state.
124320	133520	Blacker Ma, won't you come, won't you come.
133520	142800	Blacker Ma, won't you come and wash away my state.
142800	149680	Blacker Ma, won't you come, won't you come.
149680	151240	Blacker Ma!
