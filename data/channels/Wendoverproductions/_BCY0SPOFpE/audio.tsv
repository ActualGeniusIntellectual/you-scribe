12480	19360	This is the Nile River—perhaps the single most legendary waterway in the world. It originates
19360	25120	somewhere roughly here, potentially in Uganda or Burundi, but its tributaries are so convoluted
25120	31600	that no one knows for sure where its true source is. It starts in earnest, though, here,
31600	36560	on the Ugandan side of Lake Victoria, and snakes northward through the rest of Uganda and South
36560	41280	Sudan before entering Sudan and reaching its capital of Khartoum. This stretch from Lake
41280	46480	Victoria to Khartoum is considered the White Nile and, in Khartoum, it connects with the Blue Nile
46480	52800	to become the Nile proper. This other tributary starts at Lake Tana in Ethiopia, and, while it's
52800	57600	the shorter and potentially less well-known of the two, it's actually far larger than the White
57600	64960	Nile, as it carries 85% of the water that flows through the Nile itself. Of course, 100% of this
64960	70960	immense river ends up passing through Egypt. Now, while these may be their legal borders,
70960	78240	for all intents and purposes, Egypt is not this, but this. Some 95% of the country's 98 million
78240	84880	strong population lives within the narrow strip of land flanking the Nile River. Truly, Egypt is
84880	91840	the Nile and the Nile is Egypt. Almost all of its power and influence, both modern and ancient,
91840	97680	is linked to this waterway. Of course, much of what most people know this country for is its
97680	103200	past, rather than its present, as for nearly three millennia, ancient Egypt was one of the most
103280	109760	powerful and advanced civilizations on earth. Of course, one can't link the success of any society
109760	115360	to a single factor, but it's undeniable that at the time of the height of ancient Egypt's reign,
115360	120640	agricultural prowess was directly linked to societal advancement. You could only develop
120640	125600	new technology if you could produce enough food to feed the thinkers, and Egypt could,
125600	131680	thanks to the Nile. Every year, in August and September, the river would flood over its banks,
131680	136400	and then, in October, it would recede, leaving the floodplains well-watered and fertilized and
136400	141920	allowing for a very productive year of agriculture. Upstream, while its stories might not be as
141920	146960	frequently included in the high school history books, what is now Sudan benefited from a similar
146960	152400	effect. The Kingdom of Kush, in particular, became an advanced society alongside the Nile,
152400	156960	upstream from modern-day Egypt, and still to this day, much of the country's population is
156960	163280	concentrated in a narrow green zone along the Nile. That's mostly to say, Egypt and Sudan have
163280	168480	benefited through history from this river in a largely similar way, but then, there's the
168480	175040	outlier—Ethiopia. Now, comparing the satellite images of Egypt and Sudan to that of Ethiopia,
175040	181360	there's a pretty clear difference—Ethiopia is green. Save for the coast, most of Egypt
181360	186960	receives less than 10 millimeters of rain per year on average. This is also the case for much
186960	192880	of Sudan, but then, in the south, the weather gets a little wetter, the land becomes a bit greener,
192880	198880	and dependence on the Nile lowers. Of course, further upstream, in the Ethiopian highlands,
198880	204800	dependence on this river for water is nearly non-existent. Certain areas receive close to
204800	211200	80 inches or 200 centimeters of rain per year, which, in comparison, is four times that of
211200	216480	London. These immense rains, in fact, end up in the Nile itself, feeding most of its flow,
216480	222560	and eventually reach Sudan, Egypt, and the Mediterranean Ocean. At least, that was the case
222560	229040	until the early 1900s. At that time, colonial powers and industrialists sought not only to
229040	235360	use the river, but to control and fundamentally reshape it. This began in 1902 with the opening
235360	240480	of the Aswan Low Dam, then continued in the 1910s and 20s with the development of the single
240480	246400	largest irrigation system in the world in Sudan, and as time went on, the flow of the Nile became
246400	252240	less and less natural. With increasingly large dams and irrigation projects, it slowly became
252240	258320	clear that this was all, more and more, a zero-sum game. It became clear that the flow
258320	266800	of the river was, indeed, finite. Therefore, they needed treaties. In 1929, the British,
266800	271840	representing Sudan and a few other upstream countries, reached an agreement with Egypt that,
271840	277200	in exchange for a number of smaller concessions, gave the country unconditional veto power over
277200	281760	upstream projects that it believed would reduce the amount of water to reach them. This was
281760	287920	followed up in 1959 with another agreement that gave Egypt the rights to 66% of the river's flow,
287920	294000	Sudan 22%, and the rest was considered to be lost to evaporation. Through time, these and
294000	300000	other agreements created a system where Egypt, with the help of Sudan, was, on paper, the master
300000	305840	of the entire river, even beyond their borders, despite their geographic position at the very end
305840	312480	of it. Except, the one country that was never party to any of these agreements was Ethiopia,
312480	320000	where most of the water originates. Still, Egypt has maintained that the treaties of 1929 and 1959
320000	324720	are binding agreements, underscored by their historic use of the river, regardless of who
324720	329600	was at the table or who represented the upstream states under colonial rule when they were signed.
329600	334160	They believe that they have a say in water projects upstream, outside their borders,
334160	339920	insofar as the river maintains the same rate of flow whence it reaches Egypt. This remained a
339920	345760	nominal issue for most of the 20th century, but it all changed once Ethiopia had centralized enough
345760	353760	power, political will, and money to start to reshape the Nile. It all comes down to development.
353760	359680	You see, while Egypt's historic development was thanks to the water of the Nile, it's now proving
359680	366000	to be a barrier. 97% of the country's freshwater comes from this river and, while Egypt's population
366000	372240	has grown, the Nile has, effectively, shrunk. Therefore, annual water supply per capita in
372240	377760	the country has halved since 1970, even as the country's economy has further developed.
377760	382880	The UN considers any country with under 1,000 cubic meters of water per person per year as
382880	391200	water scarce. Egypt has just 570. It is now, more than ever, held back by water—for example,
391200	396320	it has to import around half of its food, at huge cost to both its people and the government,
396320	401200	which subsidizes food. While the Nile may have been more than enough when Egypt's population
401200	407200	was two or three or four million, thousands of years ago, it now is far from that as they're
407200	414160	pushing up against a population of 100 million. Ethiopia, meanwhile, does have significant issues
414160	419840	with food security, but not exactly because they don't have enough water. As most people there live
419840	426240	from harvest to harvest, they're prone to food shortages from a bad year. The semi-regular famines
426240	432560	that ensue are dramatic, but the country has managed to develop despite them. Since 2004,
432560	440720	Ethiopia's GDP has grown about 10% per year, which is immense. In fact, between 2013 and 2018,
440720	446000	it became the fastest growing economy in the world, which is especially impressive given its
446000	454080	large size. Much of this growth has been fueled by one thing—infrastructure investment. They've
454080	459200	built a new railway to Djibouti, opened East Africa's first light rail system in Addis Ababa,
459200	464800	and are planning the construction of Africa's largest airport, however, the story of Ethiopian
464800	472000	infrastructure development is most defined by just one single project—the Grand Ethiopian
472000	478800	Renaissance Dam. Located in the northwest of the country, this dam, once completed, will house the
478800	483920	eighth largest hydroelectric power facility in the world, it will be nearly three times larger than
483920	488800	the next largest on the African continent, and the reservoir behind it will be able to hold more
488800	496480	water than the entire Blue Nile itself. It will be able to produce, in a year, nearly 16,000 gigawatt
496480	504640	hours of electricity. With that, it could fulfill the power needs of 234 million Ethiopians. While
504640	509760	that would be noteworthy on its own, it's even more so considering that the population of Ethiopia
509760	517680	is only about 109 million. This project, in one fell swoop, will give the country a major power
517680	526000	surplus. That is exciting for Ethiopia for two reasons. First, it should have a multiplier effect
526080	531040	for development. Not only does building and operating the dam itself provide jobs,
531040	536560	but if this energy can make its way to rural areas especially, it could make certain jobs,
536560	541520	such as farming, more productive. According to the Rocky Mountain Institute, there's about
541520	547600	$4 billion in potential economic opportunity just from electrifying small rural farms and making
547600	552400	their processes more efficient, which is the equivalent of about 5% of the country's GDP.
552960	557920	Ethiopia has one of the lowest per capita power consumption rates in the world—the average
557920	564480	American consumes as much power as 186 Ethiopians—and increasing that can and will improve
564480	570720	quality of life and increase economic growth. In addition to that, though, having more power than
570720	577040	they need means that Ethiopia can become an energy exporter. The country plans to sell power to
577040	582800	neighboring Sudan, which is also severely energy starved, and eventually Egypt, Djibouti, Uganda,
582800	588400	and Tanzania too. All in all, according to the World Bank, Ethiopia could become the largest
588400	595920	power exporter in Africa, earning around $1 billion a year. For Ethiopia and Ethiopians,
595920	602480	this project is a physical manifestation of the country's stunning, inspiring rise and, uniquely,
602480	607840	it's truly their dam. Unlike most large infrastructure projects in the region,
607840	613360	this one was largely self-funded by taxes and bonds that everyday Ethiopians bought.
613360	618400	That means that a big chunk of Ethiopian people are financially and emotionally linked to it,
618400	623600	and it's one of the rare unifying causes in a country defined by ethnic violence and highly
623600	630320	factional politics. To Ethiopians, the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam is a powerful force
630320	636000	for good. Downstream, though, perceptions are very, very different.
636800	643760	In Egypt, this dam is viewed as an existential threat. It's a single project that has the
643760	650480	potential to upend their entire way of life. Ethiopia will have the ability to quite literally
650480	654960	flip a switch to control how much water gets to Egypt, and therefore how many people in the
654960	660800	country are hungry or thirsty. While some are concerned that Ethiopia will actually do this
660800	665200	and remove water from the river to use for agriculture, that's not likely considering
665200	670560	where the dam is—being so close to the border with Sudan, this would require them to pump water
670560	676320	back upstream, which would be hugely expensive and impractical. The more real threat for Egypt
676320	682000	is around what's starting to happen now—the filling of the reservoir. You see, given that
682080	686800	the reservoir behind the dam, required to keep the flow consistent even during drier seasons,
686800	692160	can hold the contents of the entire Blue Nile itself, the process of filling it could have
692160	697920	a significant impact on the flow rates of the river. While the long-term process of electricity
697920	702960	generation won't actually remove any water from the river, as one must run it through the turbines,
702960	707920	the short-term process of filling the reservoir will likely lead to a period of a few years when,
707920	712640	in Egypt, there's less water for agriculture, drinking, and generating electricity.
713280	718960	The big question therefore is, how long will the filling of the reservoir take?
718960	724720	For Ethiopia, they want this to happen as fast as possible. The sooner the reservoir is filled,
724720	728960	the sooner they can put all their turbines online, and the sooner they'll get a return on their
728960	734080	investment. For Egypt, though, they don't want this to happen at all, but if it does,
734080	738640	they at least want it to be filled as slow as possible, ideally in periods of heavy rain when
738640	744000	there's a surplus of water. In their minds, it's going to be easier to get through a decade or so
744000	748640	with slightly lower flows than just two or three years with dramatically lower flows.
749200	754560	Egypt is also worried about a foreign power having such immense amount of control over them—this
754560	760160	potentially permanently gives Ethiopia the upper hand. If they don't get what they want from Egypt,
760160	766880	they can just turn off the tap. Both Egypt and Ethiopia, meanwhile, seem to think that this
766880	772400	issue is worth escalating tensions over, even though, to the external observer, it's clear
772400	777840	that there is a mutually beneficial solution. On the western side of the continent, a quite
777840	783360	similar situation exists with the Senegal River. This waterway's flow originates in the mountains
783360	788400	of Guinea and, to a lesser extent, Mali—two fairly rainy countries—and snakes westward
788400	793120	to form the border between Senegal and Mauritania—two rather dry countries.
793120	797520	Recognizing that all four countries rely on this river, but for different reasons,
797520	802480	they formed an organization—the Senegal River Basin Development Authority—to jointly manage
802480	808640	the waterway for the mutual benefit of all. This organization has crafted multinational agreements
808640	813920	to ensure that the downstream drier countries have the water they need to ensure food security
813920	819360	while also ensuring that the upstream countries can benefit from cheap, clean power. They built
819360	824080	a hydroelectric dam in Mali, which shares its power jointly with Mauritania and Senegal,
824080	827840	and then another dam near the coast to prevent saltwater from making its way upstream,
827840	832960	and to irrigate farmland in Mauritania and Senegal. All in all, they treat the river as
832960	837840	a multinational asset, they recognize the dependence of downstream populations on it,
837840	843360	and they ensure that any development upstream is to the mutual benefit of all member states.
844080	850880	This can also be the case for the Nile. The Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam can benefit Ethiopia,
850880	855760	Sudan, and Egypt, such as through managing the flow to prevent floods, reduce the impact of
855760	861920	droughts, and increase productivity of all countries' dams, but only if they work together.
861920	867040	The reality right now, though, is that Egypt, Ethiopia, and the other stakeholders are
867040	872720	increasingly far from this goal. Egypt maintains a rhetoric that predicts inevitable conflict if
872720	877200	their demands are not met, while Ethiopia has reportedly been preparing for the prospect of
877200	883680	this by installing anti-aircraft batteries around the dam. Egypt has long been the political master
883680	888560	of the Nile, largely because it's historically been the dominant economy along the Nile,
888560	894320	and so it seemingly can't accept a future where that is no longer the case. Ethiopia has always
894320	899840	been the natural, geographic master of the waterway, but it is only just now coming to
899840	905360	realize that. Without experience in multinational cooperation over the river, it can't seem to
905360	911760	accept much less than full control. There are really only two futures with this river—either
911760	916560	Ethiopia and Egypt come to cooperate and then turn the Nile into an economic engine for the
916560	922640	entire region, or they don't, and fall further into a conflict which will hold them both back.
922640	928480	This entire region could have a bright future, but to get on the path towards that, they need to
928480	933840	focus on the Nile as a tool for unification, rather than division. They need to ignore the
933840	939440	political relics of the region's colonial past, and forge their own future based on the realities
939440	945440	of today. Once they do so, the Nile could not only maintain its status as one of the most legendary
945440	950480	waterways in the world, but it could regain its position as one of the most economically
950480	958400	influential ones—just as it was many millennia ago. As I get ready for a winter with
958400	963360	much more time at home, one thing I'm doing is trying to find more passions I can pursue while
963360	968000	indoors, and one of the ways I'm doing this is with Skillshare. Of course they can help you get
968000	972880	ahead at work or school with all their classes on hard skills like graphic design, but I really want
972880	978320	to highlight how they can also help you have fun on your own. Two classes that are a great example
978320	983440	of this is the one on remixing dance music and the one on live DJing. The first helps you learn a
983440	987760	skill that you can very much do at home, then the second sets you up to use these skills and
987760	992720	hopefully not-so-distant future when things like live DJing can happen again. Of course,
992720	997680	even if you don't think DJing or music production will be your passion, with the thousands of really
997680	1002240	high-quality classes they have, there's surely one that will kickstart something to captivate you
1002240	1007520	over the next few months. Whether you want to become a music producer, a YouTuber, a musician,
1007520	1013040	an illustrator, an artist, or anything, Skillshare is the place to start, and it's at no risk to you
1013040	1017360	assuming you become one of the first 1,000 to go to the link in the description, as you'll get two
