4
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:19,360
This is the Nile River—perhaps the single most legendary waterway in the world. It originates

5
00:00:19,360 --> 00:00:25,120
somewhere roughly here, potentially in Uganda or Burundi, but its tributaries are so convoluted

6
00:00:25,120 --> 00:00:31,600
that no one knows for sure where its true source is. It starts in earnest, though, here,

7
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:36,560
on the Ugandan side of Lake Victoria, and snakes northward through the rest of Uganda and South

8
00:00:36,560 --> 00:00:41,280
Sudan before entering Sudan and reaching its capital of Khartoum. This stretch from Lake

9
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:46,480
Victoria to Khartoum is considered the White Nile and, in Khartoum, it connects with the Blue Nile

10
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:52,800
to become the Nile proper. This other tributary starts at Lake Tana in Ethiopia, and, while it's

11
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:57,600
the shorter and potentially less well-known of the two, it's actually far larger than the White

12
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:04,960
Nile, as it carries 85% of the water that flows through the Nile itself. Of course, 100% of this

13
00:01:04,960 --> 00:01:10,960
immense river ends up passing through Egypt. Now, while these may be their legal borders,

14
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:18,240
for all intents and purposes, Egypt is not this, but this. Some 95% of the country's 98 million

15
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:24,880
strong population lives within the narrow strip of land flanking the Nile River. Truly, Egypt is

16
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:31,840
the Nile and the Nile is Egypt. Almost all of its power and influence, both modern and ancient,

17
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:37,680
is linked to this waterway. Of course, much of what most people know this country for is its

18
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:43,200
past, rather than its present, as for nearly three millennia, ancient Egypt was one of the most

19
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:49,760
powerful and advanced civilizations on earth. Of course, one can't link the success of any society

20
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:55,360
to a single factor, but it's undeniable that at the time of the height of ancient Egypt's reign,

21
00:01:55,360 --> 00:02:00,640
agricultural prowess was directly linked to societal advancement. You could only develop

22
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:05,600
new technology if you could produce enough food to feed the thinkers, and Egypt could,

23
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:11,680
thanks to the Nile. Every year, in August and September, the river would flood over its banks,

24
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:16,400
and then, in October, it would recede, leaving the floodplains well-watered and fertilized and

25
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:21,920
allowing for a very productive year of agriculture. Upstream, while its stories might not be as

26
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:26,960
frequently included in the high school history books, what is now Sudan benefited from a similar

27
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:32,400
effect. The Kingdom of Kush, in particular, became an advanced society alongside the Nile,

28
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:36,960
upstream from modern-day Egypt, and still to this day, much of the country's population is

29
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:43,280
concentrated in a narrow green zone along the Nile. That's mostly to say, Egypt and Sudan have

30
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:48,480
benefited through history from this river in a largely similar way, but then, there's the

31
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:55,040
outlier—Ethiopia. Now, comparing the satellite images of Egypt and Sudan to that of Ethiopia,

32
00:02:55,040 --> 00:03:01,360
there's a pretty clear difference—Ethiopia is green. Save for the coast, most of Egypt

33
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:06,960
receives less than 10 millimeters of rain per year on average. This is also the case for much

34
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:12,880
of Sudan, but then, in the south, the weather gets a little wetter, the land becomes a bit greener,

35
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:18,880
and dependence on the Nile lowers. Of course, further upstream, in the Ethiopian highlands,

36
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:24,800
dependence on this river for water is nearly non-existent. Certain areas receive close to

37
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:31,200
80 inches or 200 centimeters of rain per year, which, in comparison, is four times that of

38
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:36,480
London. These immense rains, in fact, end up in the Nile itself, feeding most of its flow,

39
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:42,560
and eventually reach Sudan, Egypt, and the Mediterranean Ocean. At least, that was the case

40
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:49,040
until the early 1900s. At that time, colonial powers and industrialists sought not only to

41
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:55,360
use the river, but to control and fundamentally reshape it. This began in 1902 with the opening

42
00:03:55,360 --> 00:04:00,480
of the Aswan Low Dam, then continued in the 1910s and 20s with the development of the single

43
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:06,400
largest irrigation system in the world in Sudan, and as time went on, the flow of the Nile became

44
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:12,240
less and less natural. With increasingly large dams and irrigation projects, it slowly became

45
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:18,320
clear that this was all, more and more, a zero-sum game. It became clear that the flow

46
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:26,800
of the river was, indeed, finite. Therefore, they needed treaties. In 1929, the British,

47
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:31,840
representing Sudan and a few other upstream countries, reached an agreement with Egypt that,

48
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:37,200
in exchange for a number of smaller concessions, gave the country unconditional veto power over

49
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:41,760
upstream projects that it believed would reduce the amount of water to reach them. This was

50
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:47,920
followed up in 1959 with another agreement that gave Egypt the rights to 66% of the river's flow,

51
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:54,000
Sudan 22%, and the rest was considered to be lost to evaporation. Through time, these and

52
00:04:54,000 --> 00:05:00,000
other agreements created a system where Egypt, with the help of Sudan, was, on paper, the master

53
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:05,840
of the entire river, even beyond their borders, despite their geographic position at the very end

54
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:12,480
of it. Except, the one country that was never party to any of these agreements was Ethiopia,

55
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:20,000
where most of the water originates. Still, Egypt has maintained that the treaties of 1929 and 1959

56
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:24,720
are binding agreements, underscored by their historic use of the river, regardless of who

57
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:29,600
was at the table or who represented the upstream states under colonial rule when they were signed.

58
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:34,160
They believe that they have a say in water projects upstream, outside their borders,

59
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:39,920
insofar as the river maintains the same rate of flow whence it reaches Egypt. This remained a

60
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:45,760
nominal issue for most of the 20th century, but it all changed once Ethiopia had centralized enough

61
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:53,760
power, political will, and money to start to reshape the Nile. It all comes down to development.

62
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:59,680
You see, while Egypt's historic development was thanks to the water of the Nile, it's now proving

63
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:06,000
to be a barrier. 97% of the country's freshwater comes from this river and, while Egypt's population

64
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:12,240
has grown, the Nile has, effectively, shrunk. Therefore, annual water supply per capita in

65
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:17,760
the country has halved since 1970, even as the country's economy has further developed.

66
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:22,880
The UN considers any country with under 1,000 cubic meters of water per person per year as

67
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:31,200
water scarce. Egypt has just 570. It is now, more than ever, held back by water—for example,

68
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:36,320
it has to import around half of its food, at huge cost to both its people and the government,

69
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:41,200
which subsidizes food. While the Nile may have been more than enough when Egypt's population

70
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:47,200
was two or three or four million, thousands of years ago, it now is far from that as they're

71
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:54,160
pushing up against a population of 100 million. Ethiopia, meanwhile, does have significant issues

72
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:59,840
with food security, but not exactly because they don't have enough water. As most people there live

73
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:06,240
from harvest to harvest, they're prone to food shortages from a bad year. The semi-regular famines

74
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:12,560
that ensue are dramatic, but the country has managed to develop despite them. Since 2004,

75
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:20,720
Ethiopia's GDP has grown about 10% per year, which is immense. In fact, between 2013 and 2018,

76
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:26,000
it became the fastest growing economy in the world, which is especially impressive given its

77
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:34,080
large size. Much of this growth has been fueled by one thing—infrastructure investment. They've

78
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:39,200
built a new railway to Djibouti, opened East Africa's first light rail system in Addis Ababa,

79
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:44,800
and are planning the construction of Africa's largest airport, however, the story of Ethiopian

80
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:52,000
infrastructure development is most defined by just one single project—the Grand Ethiopian

81
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:58,800
Renaissance Dam. Located in the northwest of the country, this dam, once completed, will house the

82
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:03,920
eighth largest hydroelectric power facility in the world, it will be nearly three times larger than

83
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:08,800
the next largest on the African continent, and the reservoir behind it will be able to hold more

84
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:16,480
water than the entire Blue Nile itself. It will be able to produce, in a year, nearly 16,000 gigawatt

85
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:24,640
hours of electricity. With that, it could fulfill the power needs of 234 million Ethiopians. While

86
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:29,760
that would be noteworthy on its own, it's even more so considering that the population of Ethiopia

87
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:37,680
is only about 109 million. This project, in one fell swoop, will give the country a major power

88
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:46,000
surplus. That is exciting for Ethiopia for two reasons. First, it should have a multiplier effect

89
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:51,040
for development. Not only does building and operating the dam itself provide jobs,

90
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:56,560
but if this energy can make its way to rural areas especially, it could make certain jobs,

91
00:08:56,560 --> 00:09:01,520
such as farming, more productive. According to the Rocky Mountain Institute, there's about

92
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:07,600
$4 billion in potential economic opportunity just from electrifying small rural farms and making

93
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:12,400
their processes more efficient, which is the equivalent of about 5% of the country's GDP.

94
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:17,920
Ethiopia has one of the lowest per capita power consumption rates in the world—the average

95
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:24,480
American consumes as much power as 186 Ethiopians—and increasing that can and will improve

96
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:30,720
quality of life and increase economic growth. In addition to that, though, having more power than

97
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:37,040
they need means that Ethiopia can become an energy exporter. The country plans to sell power to

98
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:42,800
neighboring Sudan, which is also severely energy starved, and eventually Egypt, Djibouti, Uganda,

99
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:48,400
and Tanzania too. All in all, according to the World Bank, Ethiopia could become the largest

100
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:55,920
power exporter in Africa, earning around $1 billion a year. For Ethiopia and Ethiopians,

101
00:09:55,920 --> 00:10:02,480
this project is a physical manifestation of the country's stunning, inspiring rise and, uniquely,

102
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:07,840
it's truly their dam. Unlike most large infrastructure projects in the region,

103
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:13,360
this one was largely self-funded by taxes and bonds that everyday Ethiopians bought.

104
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:18,400
That means that a big chunk of Ethiopian people are financially and emotionally linked to it,

105
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:23,600
and it's one of the rare unifying causes in a country defined by ethnic violence and highly

106
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:30,320
factional politics. To Ethiopians, the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam is a powerful force

107
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:36,000
for good. Downstream, though, perceptions are very, very different.

108
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:43,760
In Egypt, this dam is viewed as an existential threat. It's a single project that has the

109
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:50,480
potential to upend their entire way of life. Ethiopia will have the ability to quite literally

110
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:54,960
flip a switch to control how much water gets to Egypt, and therefore how many people in the

111
00:10:54,960 --> 00:11:00,800
country are hungry or thirsty. While some are concerned that Ethiopia will actually do this

112
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:05,200
and remove water from the river to use for agriculture, that's not likely considering

113
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:10,560
where the dam is—being so close to the border with Sudan, this would require them to pump water

114
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:16,320
back upstream, which would be hugely expensive and impractical. The more real threat for Egypt

115
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:22,000
is around what's starting to happen now—the filling of the reservoir. You see, given that

116
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:26,800
the reservoir behind the dam, required to keep the flow consistent even during drier seasons,

117
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:32,160
can hold the contents of the entire Blue Nile itself, the process of filling it could have

118
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:37,920
a significant impact on the flow rates of the river. While the long-term process of electricity

119
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:42,960
generation won't actually remove any water from the river, as one must run it through the turbines,

120
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:47,920
the short-term process of filling the reservoir will likely lead to a period of a few years when,

121
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:52,640
in Egypt, there's less water for agriculture, drinking, and generating electricity.

122
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:58,960
The big question therefore is, how long will the filling of the reservoir take?

123
00:11:58,960 --> 00:12:04,720
For Ethiopia, they want this to happen as fast as possible. The sooner the reservoir is filled,

124
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:08,960
the sooner they can put all their turbines online, and the sooner they'll get a return on their

125
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:14,080
investment. For Egypt, though, they don't want this to happen at all, but if it does,

126
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:18,640
they at least want it to be filled as slow as possible, ideally in periods of heavy rain when

127
00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:24,000
there's a surplus of water. In their minds, it's going to be easier to get through a decade or so

128
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:28,640
with slightly lower flows than just two or three years with dramatically lower flows.

129
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:34,560
Egypt is also worried about a foreign power having such immense amount of control over them—this

130
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:40,160
potentially permanently gives Ethiopia the upper hand. If they don't get what they want from Egypt,

131
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:46,880
they can just turn off the tap. Both Egypt and Ethiopia, meanwhile, seem to think that this

132
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:52,400
issue is worth escalating tensions over, even though, to the external observer, it's clear

133
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:57,840
that there is a mutually beneficial solution. On the western side of the continent, a quite

134
00:12:57,840 --> 00:13:03,360
similar situation exists with the Senegal River. This waterway's flow originates in the mountains

135
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:08,400
of Guinea and, to a lesser extent, Mali—two fairly rainy countries—and snakes westward

136
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:13,120
to form the border between Senegal and Mauritania—two rather dry countries.

137
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:17,520
Recognizing that all four countries rely on this river, but for different reasons,

138
00:13:17,520 --> 00:13:22,480
they formed an organization—the Senegal River Basin Development Authority—to jointly manage

139
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:28,640
the waterway for the mutual benefit of all. This organization has crafted multinational agreements

140
00:13:28,640 --> 00:13:33,920
to ensure that the downstream drier countries have the water they need to ensure food security

141
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:39,360
while also ensuring that the upstream countries can benefit from cheap, clean power. They built

142
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:44,080
a hydroelectric dam in Mali, which shares its power jointly with Mauritania and Senegal,

143
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:47,840
and then another dam near the coast to prevent saltwater from making its way upstream,

144
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:52,960
and to irrigate farmland in Mauritania and Senegal. All in all, they treat the river as

145
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:57,840
a multinational asset, they recognize the dependence of downstream populations on it,

146
00:13:57,840 --> 00:14:03,360
and they ensure that any development upstream is to the mutual benefit of all member states.

147
00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:10,880
This can also be the case for the Nile. The Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam can benefit Ethiopia,

148
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:15,760
Sudan, and Egypt, such as through managing the flow to prevent floods, reduce the impact of

149
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:21,920
droughts, and increase productivity of all countries' dams, but only if they work together.

150
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:27,040
The reality right now, though, is that Egypt, Ethiopia, and the other stakeholders are

151
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:32,720
increasingly far from this goal. Egypt maintains a rhetoric that predicts inevitable conflict if

152
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:37,200
their demands are not met, while Ethiopia has reportedly been preparing for the prospect of

153
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:43,680
this by installing anti-aircraft batteries around the dam. Egypt has long been the political master

154
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:48,560
of the Nile, largely because it's historically been the dominant economy along the Nile,

155
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:54,320
and so it seemingly can't accept a future where that is no longer the case. Ethiopia has always

156
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:59,840
been the natural, geographic master of the waterway, but it is only just now coming to

157
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:05,360
realize that. Without experience in multinational cooperation over the river, it can't seem to

158
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:11,760
accept much less than full control. There are really only two futures with this river—either

159
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:16,560
Ethiopia and Egypt come to cooperate and then turn the Nile into an economic engine for the

160
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:22,640
entire region, or they don't, and fall further into a conflict which will hold them both back.

161
00:15:22,640 --> 00:15:28,480
This entire region could have a bright future, but to get on the path towards that, they need to

162
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:33,840
focus on the Nile as a tool for unification, rather than division. They need to ignore the

163
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:39,440
political relics of the region's colonial past, and forge their own future based on the realities

164
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:45,440
of today. Once they do so, the Nile could not only maintain its status as one of the most legendary

165
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:50,480
waterways in the world, but it could regain its position as one of the most economically

166
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:58,400
influential ones—just as it was many millennia ago. As I get ready for a winter with

167
00:15:58,400 --> 00:16:03,360
much more time at home, one thing I'm doing is trying to find more passions I can pursue while

168
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:08,000
indoors, and one of the ways I'm doing this is with Skillshare. Of course they can help you get

169
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:12,880
ahead at work or school with all their classes on hard skills like graphic design, but I really want

170
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:18,320
to highlight how they can also help you have fun on your own. Two classes that are a great example

171
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:23,440
of this is the one on remixing dance music and the one on live DJing. The first helps you learn a

172
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:27,760
skill that you can very much do at home, then the second sets you up to use these skills and

173
00:16:27,760 --> 00:16:32,720
hopefully not-so-distant future when things like live DJing can happen again. Of course,

174
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:37,680
even if you don't think DJing or music production will be your passion, with the thousands of really

175
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:42,240
high-quality classes they have, there's surely one that will kickstart something to captivate you

176
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:47,520
over the next few months. Whether you want to become a music producer, a YouTuber, a musician,

177
00:16:47,520 --> 00:16:53,040
an illustrator, an artist, or anything, Skillshare is the place to start, and it's at no risk to you

178
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:57,360
assuming you become one of the first 1,000 to go to the link in the description, as you'll get two

179
00:16:57,360 --> 00:17:01,280
months of learning on Skillshare for free, and you'll be supporting Wendover Productions

180
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:05,120
while you're at it.
