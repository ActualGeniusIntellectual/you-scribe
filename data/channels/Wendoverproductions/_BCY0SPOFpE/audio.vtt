1,000 to go to the link in the description.

00:12.480 --> 00:19.360
This is the Nile River—perhaps the single most legendary waterway in the world. It originates

00:19.360 --> 00:25.120
somewhere roughly here, potentially in Uganda or Burundi, but its tributaries are so convoluted

00:25.120 --> 00:31.600
that no one knows for sure where its true source is. It starts in earnest, though, here,

00:31.600 --> 00:36.560
on the Ugandan side of Lake Victoria, and snakes northward through the rest of Uganda and South

00:36.560 --> 00:41.280
Sudan before entering Sudan and reaching its capital of Khartoum. This stretch from Lake

00:41.280 --> 00:46.480
Victoria to Khartoum is considered the White Nile and, in Khartoum, it connects with the Blue Nile

00:46.480 --> 00:52.800
to become the Nile proper. This other tributary starts at Lake Tana in Ethiopia, and, while it's

00:52.800 --> 00:57.600
the shorter and potentially less well-known of the two, it's actually far larger than the White

00:57.600 --> 01:04.960
Nile, as it carries 85% of the water that flows through the Nile itself. Of course, 100% of this

01:04.960 --> 01:10.960
immense river ends up passing through Egypt. Now, while these may be their legal borders,

01:10.960 --> 01:18.240
for all intents and purposes, Egypt is not this, but this. Some 95% of the country's 98 million

01:18.240 --> 01:24.880
strong population lives within the narrow strip of land flanking the Nile River. Truly, Egypt is

01:24.880 --> 01:31.840
the Nile and the Nile is Egypt. Almost all of its power and influence, both modern and ancient,

01:31.840 --> 01:37.680
is linked to this waterway. Of course, much of what most people know this country for is its

01:37.680 --> 01:43.200
past, rather than its present, as for nearly three millennia, ancient Egypt was one of the most

01:43.280 --> 01:49.760
powerful and advanced civilizations on earth. Of course, one can't link the success of any society

01:49.760 --> 01:55.360
to a single factor, but it's undeniable that at the time of the height of ancient Egypt's reign,

01:55.360 --> 02:00.640
agricultural prowess was directly linked to societal advancement. You could only develop

02:00.640 --> 02:05.600
new technology if you could produce enough food to feed the thinkers, and Egypt could,

02:05.600 --> 02:11.680
thanks to the Nile. Every year, in August and September, the river would flood over its banks,

02:11.680 --> 02:16.400
and then, in October, it would recede, leaving the floodplains well-watered and fertilized and

02:16.400 --> 02:21.920
allowing for a very productive year of agriculture. Upstream, while its stories might not be as

02:21.920 --> 02:26.960
frequently included in the high school history books, what is now Sudan benefited from a similar

02:26.960 --> 02:32.400
effect. The Kingdom of Kush, in particular, became an advanced society alongside the Nile,

02:32.400 --> 02:36.960
upstream from modern-day Egypt, and still to this day, much of the country's population is

02:36.960 --> 02:43.280
concentrated in a narrow green zone along the Nile. That's mostly to say, Egypt and Sudan have

02:43.280 --> 02:48.480
benefited through history from this river in a largely similar way, but then, there's the

02:48.480 --> 02:55.040
outlier—Ethiopia. Now, comparing the satellite images of Egypt and Sudan to that of Ethiopia,

02:55.040 --> 03:01.360
there's a pretty clear difference—Ethiopia is green. Save for the coast, most of Egypt

03:01.360 --> 03:06.960
receives less than 10 millimeters of rain per year on average. This is also the case for much

03:06.960 --> 03:12.880
of Sudan, but then, in the south, the weather gets a little wetter, the land becomes a bit greener,

03:12.880 --> 03:18.880
and dependence on the Nile lowers. Of course, further upstream, in the Ethiopian highlands,

03:18.880 --> 03:24.800
dependence on this river for water is nearly non-existent. Certain areas receive close to

03:24.800 --> 03:31.200
80 inches or 200 centimeters of rain per year, which, in comparison, is four times that of

03:31.200 --> 03:36.480
London. These immense rains, in fact, end up in the Nile itself, feeding most of its flow,

03:36.480 --> 03:42.560
and eventually reach Sudan, Egypt, and the Mediterranean Ocean. At least, that was the case

03:42.560 --> 03:49.040
until the early 1900s. At that time, colonial powers and industrialists sought not only to

03:49.040 --> 03:55.360
use the river, but to control and fundamentally reshape it. This began in 1902 with the opening

03:55.360 --> 04:00.480
of the Aswan Low Dam, then continued in the 1910s and 20s with the development of the single

04:00.480 --> 04:06.400
largest irrigation system in the world in Sudan, and as time went on, the flow of the Nile became

04:06.400 --> 04:12.240
less and less natural. With increasingly large dams and irrigation projects, it slowly became

04:12.240 --> 04:18.320
clear that this was all, more and more, a zero-sum game. It became clear that the flow

04:18.320 --> 04:26.800
of the river was, indeed, finite. Therefore, they needed treaties. In 1929, the British,

04:26.800 --> 04:31.840
representing Sudan and a few other upstream countries, reached an agreement with Egypt that,

04:31.840 --> 04:37.200
in exchange for a number of smaller concessions, gave the country unconditional veto power over

04:37.200 --> 04:41.760
upstream projects that it believed would reduce the amount of water to reach them. This was

04:41.760 --> 04:47.920
followed up in 1959 with another agreement that gave Egypt the rights to 66% of the river's flow,

04:47.920 --> 04:54.000
Sudan 22%, and the rest was considered to be lost to evaporation. Through time, these and

04:54.000 --> 05:00.000
other agreements created a system where Egypt, with the help of Sudan, was, on paper, the master

05:00.000 --> 05:05.840
of the entire river, even beyond their borders, despite their geographic position at the very end

05:05.840 --> 05:12.480
of it. Except, the one country that was never party to any of these agreements was Ethiopia,

05:12.480 --> 05:20.000
where most of the water originates. Still, Egypt has maintained that the treaties of 1929 and 1959

05:20.000 --> 05:24.720
are binding agreements, underscored by their historic use of the river, regardless of who

05:24.720 --> 05:29.600
was at the table or who represented the upstream states under colonial rule when they were signed.

05:29.600 --> 05:34.160
They believe that they have a say in water projects upstream, outside their borders,

05:34.160 --> 05:39.920
insofar as the river maintains the same rate of flow whence it reaches Egypt. This remained a

05:39.920 --> 05:45.760
nominal issue for most of the 20th century, but it all changed once Ethiopia had centralized enough

05:45.760 --> 05:53.760
power, political will, and money to start to reshape the Nile. It all comes down to development.

05:53.760 --> 05:59.680
You see, while Egypt's historic development was thanks to the water of the Nile, it's now proving

05:59.680 --> 06:06.000
to be a barrier. 97% of the country's freshwater comes from this river and, while Egypt's population

06:06.000 --> 06:12.240
has grown, the Nile has, effectively, shrunk. Therefore, annual water supply per capita in

06:12.240 --> 06:17.760
the country has halved since 1970, even as the country's economy has further developed.

06:17.760 --> 06:22.880
The UN considers any country with under 1,000 cubic meters of water per person per year as

06:22.880 --> 06:31.200
water scarce. Egypt has just 570. It is now, more than ever, held back by water—for example,

06:31.200 --> 06:36.320
it has to import around half of its food, at huge cost to both its people and the government,

06:36.320 --> 06:41.200
which subsidizes food. While the Nile may have been more than enough when Egypt's population

06:41.200 --> 06:47.200
was two or three or four million, thousands of years ago, it now is far from that as they're

06:47.200 --> 06:54.160
pushing up against a population of 100 million. Ethiopia, meanwhile, does have significant issues

06:54.160 --> 06:59.840
with food security, but not exactly because they don't have enough water. As most people there live

06:59.840 --> 07:06.240
from harvest to harvest, they're prone to food shortages from a bad year. The semi-regular famines

07:06.240 --> 07:12.560
that ensue are dramatic, but the country has managed to develop despite them. Since 2004,

07:12.560 --> 07:20.720
Ethiopia's GDP has grown about 10% per year, which is immense. In fact, between 2013 and 2018,

07:20.720 --> 07:26.000
it became the fastest growing economy in the world, which is especially impressive given its

07:26.000 --> 07:34.080
large size. Much of this growth has been fueled by one thing—infrastructure investment. They've

07:34.080 --> 07:39.200
built a new railway to Djibouti, opened East Africa's first light rail system in Addis Ababa,

07:39.200 --> 07:44.800
and are planning the construction of Africa's largest airport, however, the story of Ethiopian

07:44.800 --> 07:52.000
infrastructure development is most defined by just one single project—the Grand Ethiopian

07:52.000 --> 07:58.800
Renaissance Dam. Located in the northwest of the country, this dam, once completed, will house the

07:58.800 --> 08:03.920
eighth largest hydroelectric power facility in the world, it will be nearly three times larger than

08:03.920 --> 08:08.800
the next largest on the African continent, and the reservoir behind it will be able to hold more

08:08.800 --> 08:16.480
water than the entire Blue Nile itself. It will be able to produce, in a year, nearly 16,000 gigawatt

08:16.480 --> 08:24.640
hours of electricity. With that, it could fulfill the power needs of 234 million Ethiopians. While

08:24.640 --> 08:29.760
that would be noteworthy on its own, it's even more so considering that the population of Ethiopia

08:29.760 --> 08:37.680
is only about 109 million. This project, in one fell swoop, will give the country a major power

08:37.680 --> 08:46.000
surplus. That is exciting for Ethiopia for two reasons. First, it should have a multiplier effect

08:46.080 --> 08:51.040
for development. Not only does building and operating the dam itself provide jobs,

08:51.040 --> 08:56.560
but if this energy can make its way to rural areas especially, it could make certain jobs,

08:56.560 --> 09:01.520
such as farming, more productive. According to the Rocky Mountain Institute, there's about

09:01.520 --> 09:07.600
$4 billion in potential economic opportunity just from electrifying small rural farms and making

09:07.600 --> 09:12.400
their processes more efficient, which is the equivalent of about 5% of the country's GDP.

09:12.960 --> 09:17.920
Ethiopia has one of the lowest per capita power consumption rates in the world—the average

09:17.920 --> 09:24.480
American consumes as much power as 186 Ethiopians—and increasing that can and will improve

09:24.480 --> 09:30.720
quality of life and increase economic growth. In addition to that, though, having more power than

09:30.720 --> 09:37.040
they need means that Ethiopia can become an energy exporter. The country plans to sell power to

09:37.040 --> 09:42.800
neighboring Sudan, which is also severely energy starved, and eventually Egypt, Djibouti, Uganda,

09:42.800 --> 09:48.400
and Tanzania too. All in all, according to the World Bank, Ethiopia could become the largest

09:48.400 --> 09:55.920
power exporter in Africa, earning around $1 billion a year. For Ethiopia and Ethiopians,

09:55.920 --> 10:02.480
this project is a physical manifestation of the country's stunning, inspiring rise and, uniquely,

10:02.480 --> 10:07.840
it's truly their dam. Unlike most large infrastructure projects in the region,

10:07.840 --> 10:13.360
this one was largely self-funded by taxes and bonds that everyday Ethiopians bought.

10:13.360 --> 10:18.400
That means that a big chunk of Ethiopian people are financially and emotionally linked to it,

10:18.400 --> 10:23.600
and it's one of the rare unifying causes in a country defined by ethnic violence and highly

10:23.600 --> 10:30.320
factional politics. To Ethiopians, the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam is a powerful force

10:30.320 --> 10:36.000
for good. Downstream, though, perceptions are very, very different.

10:36.800 --> 10:43.760
In Egypt, this dam is viewed as an existential threat. It's a single project that has the

10:43.760 --> 10:50.480
potential to upend their entire way of life. Ethiopia will have the ability to quite literally

10:50.480 --> 10:54.960
flip a switch to control how much water gets to Egypt, and therefore how many people in the

10:54.960 --> 11:00.800
country are hungry or thirsty. While some are concerned that Ethiopia will actually do this

11:00.800 --> 11:05.200
and remove water from the river to use for agriculture, that's not likely considering

11:05.200 --> 11:10.560
where the dam is—being so close to the border with Sudan, this would require them to pump water

11:10.560 --> 11:16.320
back upstream, which would be hugely expensive and impractical. The more real threat for Egypt

11:16.320 --> 11:22.000
is around what's starting to happen now—the filling of the reservoir. You see, given that

11:22.080 --> 11:26.800
the reservoir behind the dam, required to keep the flow consistent even during drier seasons,

11:26.800 --> 11:32.160
can hold the contents of the entire Blue Nile itself, the process of filling it could have

11:32.160 --> 11:37.920
a significant impact on the flow rates of the river. While the long-term process of electricity

11:37.920 --> 11:42.960
generation won't actually remove any water from the river, as one must run it through the turbines,

11:42.960 --> 11:47.920
the short-term process of filling the reservoir will likely lead to a period of a few years when,

11:47.920 --> 11:52.640
in Egypt, there's less water for agriculture, drinking, and generating electricity.

11:53.280 --> 11:58.960
The big question therefore is, how long will the filling of the reservoir take?

11:58.960 --> 12:04.720
For Ethiopia, they want this to happen as fast as possible. The sooner the reservoir is filled,

12:04.720 --> 12:08.960
the sooner they can put all their turbines online, and the sooner they'll get a return on their

12:08.960 --> 12:14.080
investment. For Egypt, though, they don't want this to happen at all, but if it does,

12:14.080 --> 12:18.640
they at least want it to be filled as slow as possible, ideally in periods of heavy rain when

12:18.640 --> 12:24.000
there's a surplus of water. In their minds, it's going to be easier to get through a decade or so

12:24.000 --> 12:28.640
with slightly lower flows than just two or three years with dramatically lower flows.

12:29.200 --> 12:34.560
Egypt is also worried about a foreign power having such immense amount of control over them—this

12:34.560 --> 12:40.160
potentially permanently gives Ethiopia the upper hand. If they don't get what they want from Egypt,

12:40.160 --> 12:46.880
they can just turn off the tap. Both Egypt and Ethiopia, meanwhile, seem to think that this

12:46.880 --> 12:52.400
issue is worth escalating tensions over, even though, to the external observer, it's clear

12:52.400 --> 12:57.840
that there is a mutually beneficial solution. On the western side of the continent, a quite

12:57.840 --> 13:03.360
similar situation exists with the Senegal River. This waterway's flow originates in the mountains

13:03.360 --> 13:08.400
of Guinea and, to a lesser extent, Mali—two fairly rainy countries—and snakes westward

13:08.400 --> 13:13.120
to form the border between Senegal and Mauritania—two rather dry countries.

13:13.120 --> 13:17.520
Recognizing that all four countries rely on this river, but for different reasons,

13:17.520 --> 13:22.480
they formed an organization—the Senegal River Basin Development Authority—to jointly manage

13:22.480 --> 13:28.640
the waterway for the mutual benefit of all. This organization has crafted multinational agreements

13:28.640 --> 13:33.920
to ensure that the downstream drier countries have the water they need to ensure food security

13:33.920 --> 13:39.360
while also ensuring that the upstream countries can benefit from cheap, clean power. They built

13:39.360 --> 13:44.080
a hydroelectric dam in Mali, which shares its power jointly with Mauritania and Senegal,

13:44.080 --> 13:47.840
and then another dam near the coast to prevent saltwater from making its way upstream,

13:47.840 --> 13:52.960
and to irrigate farmland in Mauritania and Senegal. All in all, they treat the river as

13:52.960 --> 13:57.840
a multinational asset, they recognize the dependence of downstream populations on it,

13:57.840 --> 14:03.360
and they ensure that any development upstream is to the mutual benefit of all member states.

14:04.080 --> 14:10.880
This can also be the case for the Nile. The Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam can benefit Ethiopia,

14:10.880 --> 14:15.760
Sudan, and Egypt, such as through managing the flow to prevent floods, reduce the impact of

14:15.760 --> 14:21.920
droughts, and increase productivity of all countries' dams, but only if they work together.

14:21.920 --> 14:27.040
The reality right now, though, is that Egypt, Ethiopia, and the other stakeholders are

14:27.040 --> 14:32.720
increasingly far from this goal. Egypt maintains a rhetoric that predicts inevitable conflict if

14:32.720 --> 14:37.200
their demands are not met, while Ethiopia has reportedly been preparing for the prospect of

14:37.200 --> 14:43.680
this by installing anti-aircraft batteries around the dam. Egypt has long been the political master

14:43.680 --> 14:48.560
of the Nile, largely because it's historically been the dominant economy along the Nile,

14:48.560 --> 14:54.320
and so it seemingly can't accept a future where that is no longer the case. Ethiopia has always

14:54.320 --> 14:59.840
been the natural, geographic master of the waterway, but it is only just now coming to

14:59.840 --> 15:05.360
realize that. Without experience in multinational cooperation over the river, it can't seem to

15:05.360 --> 15:11.760
accept much less than full control. There are really only two futures with this river—either

15:11.760 --> 15:16.560
Ethiopia and Egypt come to cooperate and then turn the Nile into an economic engine for the

15:16.560 --> 15:22.640
entire region, or they don't, and fall further into a conflict which will hold them both back.

15:22.640 --> 15:28.480
This entire region could have a bright future, but to get on the path towards that, they need to

15:28.480 --> 15:33.840
focus on the Nile as a tool for unification, rather than division. They need to ignore the

15:33.840 --> 15:39.440
political relics of the region's colonial past, and forge their own future based on the realities

15:39.440 --> 15:45.440
of today. Once they do so, the Nile could not only maintain its status as one of the most legendary

15:45.440 --> 15:50.480
waterways in the world, but it could regain its position as one of the most economically

15:50.480 --> 15:58.400
influential ones—just as it was many millennia ago. As I get ready for a winter with

15:58.400 --> 16:03.360
much more time at home, one thing I'm doing is trying to find more passions I can pursue while

16:03.360 --> 16:08.000
indoors, and one of the ways I'm doing this is with Skillshare. Of course they can help you get

16:08.000 --> 16:12.880
ahead at work or school with all their classes on hard skills like graphic design, but I really want

16:12.880 --> 16:18.320
to highlight how they can also help you have fun on your own. Two classes that are a great example

16:18.320 --> 16:23.440
of this is the one on remixing dance music and the one on live DJing. The first helps you learn a

16:23.440 --> 16:27.760
skill that you can very much do at home, then the second sets you up to use these skills and

16:27.760 --> 16:32.720
hopefully not-so-distant future when things like live DJing can happen again. Of course,

16:32.720 --> 16:37.680
even if you don't think DJing or music production will be your passion, with the thousands of really

16:37.680 --> 16:42.240
high-quality classes they have, there's surely one that will kickstart something to captivate you

16:42.240 --> 16:47.520
over the next few months. Whether you want to become a music producer, a YouTuber, a musician,

16:47.520 --> 16:53.040
an illustrator, an artist, or anything, Skillshare is the place to start, and it's at no risk to you

16:53.040 --> 16:57.360
assuming you become one of the first 1,000 to go to the link in the description, as you'll get two

16:57.360 --> 17:01.280
months of learning on Skillshare for free, and you'll be supporting Wendover Productions

17:01.280 --> 17:05.120
while you're at it.
