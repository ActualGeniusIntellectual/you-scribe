1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,320
For a moment, there was so much hope.

2
00:00:04,320 --> 00:00:05,320
Apartheid was over.

3
00:00:05,320 --> 00:00:10,760
South Africa had, for decades, essentially operated as two different nations superimposed

4
00:00:10,760 --> 00:00:12,520
on the same landscape.

5
00:00:12,520 --> 00:00:17,680
There was the white nation, wealthy and westernized, boasting a similar, if not higher standard

6
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:22,540
of living to that of Europe due to its similarly strong and diversified economy.

7
00:00:22,540 --> 00:00:27,040
Then there was the black nation, impoverished and excluded from that wealthier white nation

8
00:00:27,040 --> 00:00:30,940
by a legally enshrined system of segregation.

9
00:00:30,940 --> 00:00:36,440
It felt like Europeans had just built an insular outpost in Africa—that's to say, it felt

10
00:00:36,440 --> 00:00:38,240
like what it was.

11
00:00:38,240 --> 00:00:42,520
But finally, following decades of internal struggle and mounting international pressure

12
00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:47,660
that reached a climax with the waning need for an African anti-Soviet ally, the nation's

13
00:00:47,660 --> 00:00:51,980
new president announced the release of apartheid-era political prisoners.

14
00:00:51,980 --> 00:00:56,680
Most of these prisoners were members of the African National Congress, the strongest anti-apartheid

15
00:00:56,720 --> 00:01:01,640
force, including the famed and beloved Nelson Mandela.

16
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:06,320
As time marched forward, Mandela negotiated with the existing government to ensure a peaceful

17
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:10,960
transition—something some thought impossible, as the structures of apartheid were stripped

18
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:11,960
away.

19
00:01:11,960 --> 00:01:17,760
Then, in South Africa's first truly democratic election, the most symbolic moment yet—Nelson

20
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:23,520
Mandela, the former prisoner, was elected President of South Africa.

21
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:28,540
In the view of most, at that moment, South Africa was brimming with potential.

22
00:01:28,540 --> 00:01:34,360
It had massive mineral wealth, it had a diversified economy, it had a large, highly educated workforce.

23
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:39,340
As the continent rose, the world hoped and believed that South Africa could be the poster

24
00:01:39,340 --> 00:01:43,120
child of the potential of African economic and human development.

25
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:47,600
If the white and black nations could truly integrate into one, the country was well on

26
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:53,480
its way towards being considered a social and economic equivalent to, say, New Zealand.

27
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:57,040
Another former British colony in the Southern Hemisphere that managed to transition into

28
00:01:57,040 --> 00:02:01,240
a self-sufficient, high-income, multicultural society.

29
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:06,400
Crucial to this, perhaps the greatest task that Mandela and his ANC party was faced with

30
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:09,560
was how to build a black middle class.

31
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:13,600
The legally enshrined systems of segregation were easy to do away with—they could be

32
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:18,480
reversed in an instant—but what was left was a massive population trapped in the cycle

33
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:19,720
of poverty.

34
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:24,120
Simultaneously, there was the wealthy white population at the center of the current economic

35
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:28,400
system who would not tolerate a simple redistribution of wealth.

36
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:34,200
So, the ANC had to thread the needle—correct for historical wrongs while maintaining most

37
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:35,720
of the status quo.

38
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:39,160
Initially, they were fairly successful at this.

39
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:43,920
The beginnings came naturally as black party members moved into many of the stable, well-compensated

40
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:48,600
public sector jobs previously held by the white minority, then the trend permeated elsewhere

41
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:53,560
as qualified individuals excluded only due to the color of their skin entered every other

42
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:56,160
newly desegregated profession.

43
00:02:56,160 --> 00:03:00,800
Formerly impoverished townships like Soweto metamorphosed from slums into sprawling suburban

44
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:05,800
neighborhoods filled with rows of single-family homes and ample assortments of upscale restaurants

45
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:06,800
and bars.

46
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:12,000
And crucially, this wasn't due to wealth moving in, but rather wealth being built—the

47
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:16,360
white population of Soweto stayed at just a fraction of a percent.

48
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:20,720
More broadly, nationwide, according to one study's definition, the black middle class

49
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:27,360
grew from just 1.7 million in 2004 to 4.2 million just eight years later.

50
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:31,600
As perhaps the strongest validation of South Africa's progress so far, the nation was

51
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:37,080
selected to host the 2010 FIFA World Cup, an event that had never before taken place

52
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:39,240
on the African continent.

53
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:41,720
This sent a message.

54
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:47,320
It said that, of anywhere in Africa, South Africa was the place most capable of hosting

55
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:50,600
the world's second highest profile sporting event.

56
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:52,940
Inevitably, naysayers arose.

57
00:03:52,940 --> 00:03:57,160
They said the nation couldn't possibly build the stadiums in time, then when they did,

58
00:03:57,160 --> 00:04:01,520
they said the stadiums were shoddy and would crumble apart, then when they didn't, they

59
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:06,160
said that fans wouldn't possibly show up fearful for their lives in crime-riddled South

60
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:09,720
African streets, but they certainly did.

61
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:14,720
As the sound of vuvuzillas engulfed the TV broadcasts, the world was captivated by the

62
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:20,360
host country, and it was now thought of in the same vein as Germany, or Japan, or France,

63
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:23,480
or any of the other World Cup hosts.

64
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:29,300
But eventually, Spain bested the Netherlands, the TV broadcasts wrapped up, the lights of

65
00:04:29,300 --> 00:04:34,440
Soccer City Stadium switched off, the fans flew home, the years marched on, and time

66
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:37,160
revealed an uncomfortable truth.

67
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:41,760
While the government was able to emulate stability for the short period, they were able to create

68
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:47,640
a facsimile of the experience in Germany or Japan or France, it didn't last.

69
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:49,540
Progress had stagnated.

70
00:04:49,540 --> 00:04:52,920
It might have actually reversed.

71
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:58,400
This is perhaps best represented by this, the least popular document in South Africa.

72
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:03,200
Nowadays, it's published each month by the government-owned power utility, ESCOM, and

73
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:08,980
outlines the schedule of when each municipality will have their electricity supply shut off.

74
00:05:08,980 --> 00:05:12,800
After decades of deferred maintenance on a power system mostly designed to service the

75
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:18,380
white minority, plant failures have escalated this issue into a chronic mismatch between

76
00:05:18,380 --> 00:05:20,360
supply and demand.

77
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:26,140
That creates this dissonance—a country that, in part, looks as developed as the most upscale

78
00:05:26,140 --> 00:05:32,800
areas in Europe, yet is plunged into darkness as frequently as its poorest African neighbors.

79
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:36,320
These days, a lack of load shedding is the exception.

80
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:44,260
So far in 2023, there have been 5,858 hours when the grid has failed to meet demand.

81
00:05:44,260 --> 00:05:48,460
But while perhaps the most palpable issue that creates some of the most sizable domino

82
00:05:48,460 --> 00:05:54,520
effects, South Africa is increasingly failing to provide the absolute bare bones of public

83
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:55,520
services.

84
00:05:55,520 --> 00:06:00,760
In 2018, Cape Town nearly became the first major city anywhere to run out of water, as

85
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:06,120
the city's reservoirs ran dry during a drought—a crisis created in part by a lack

86
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:10,400
of government foresight—but more broadly and regularly, the share of households with

87
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:15,600
access to drinking water has started to decline in recent years.

88
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:20,120
Water infrastructure is crumbling, and just recently, dozens have died on the outskirts

89
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:25,420
of Pretoria, the administrative capital, due to cholera—a disease virtually eliminated

90
00:06:25,420 --> 00:06:28,840
from the modern world thanks to modern sanitation systems.

91
00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:33,640
The nation's homicide rate is skyrocketing, climbing up towards its all-time high, and

92
00:06:33,640 --> 00:06:39,340
the police and judiciary appear entirely ineffective at combating this as just 20% of murders end

93
00:06:39,340 --> 00:06:44,440
up with anyone in court, and even then, just 31% of the public has trust in the courts

94
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:47,440
as the legal system breaks down as well.

95
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:51,920
South Africa's state-owned freight rail monopoly, Transnet, is too collapsing, in

96
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:57,160
a very similar situation to Eskom as it closes lines, struggles to keep locomotives running,

97
00:06:57,160 --> 00:07:03,080
and carries 25% less cargo today than in 2015—a massive constraint for the country's

98
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:06,240
lucrative export-focused industrial sector.

99
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:12,080
South African Airways, which was separated from Transnet in 2006 but remained government-owned,

100
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:17,480
fully collapsed and ceased all operations in 2020 before restarting with new financing

101
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:22,160
as an embarrassing shell of its previously globe-spanning self.

102
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:26,680
No matter where one looks, one struggles to find any case where government service is

103
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:32,680
improving in South Africa, and the closer one looks, the more sense this starts to make.

104
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:38,800
When the blackouts began in 2007, they were little more than random, local, short-lasted,

105
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:40,560
inconvenient irregularities.

106
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:46,500
Then, in the January heat of the southern summer, they got a lot worse.

107
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:51,280
With demand surging past supply, tourists sat stranded in cable cars high above Cape

108
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:56,140
Town, mines evacuated miners from shafts that they could no longer ventilate or cool, and

109
00:07:56,140 --> 00:07:59,860
the South African government declared a national emergency.

110
00:07:59,860 --> 00:08:04,360
The panic power cuts made international news and tipped global markets as the price of

111
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:09,440
gold and platinum shot skyward after announcement that mines might not open for another six

112
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:10,580
weeks.

113
00:08:10,580 --> 00:08:14,800
It was not the first load shedding that Eskom had mandated in recent months, but it was

114
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:16,500
by far the worst.

115
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:18,620
And it was right on time.

116
00:08:18,620 --> 00:08:23,420
In fact, this very moment, when South Africa's mighty grid was catastrophically overstretched

117
00:08:23,420 --> 00:08:30,000
by its consumers, had been predicted to nearly the exact year in this 1998 white paper.

118
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:34,740
As the paper had estimated, should no action be taken to expand power supply in South Africa,

119
00:08:34,740 --> 00:08:40,980
the country's surplus, then sitting at a healthy 25% in 1997, would evaporate away

120
00:08:40,980 --> 00:08:43,740
by about 2007.

121
00:08:43,740 --> 00:08:46,260
And no action was taken.

122
00:08:46,260 --> 00:08:49,900
For all that changed politically and socially with the end of apartheid and the rise of

123
00:08:49,900 --> 00:08:54,740
the AMC, South Africa's grid on the supply side just didn't.

124
00:08:54,740 --> 00:08:59,580
Of the nation's 15 separate power plants capable of producing more than 1,000 megawatts,

125
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:05,220
only these two came online during the period from 1990 to 2008, while these two were hastily

126
00:09:05,220 --> 00:09:10,840
brought back into production having been mothballed decades prior when the country was power flush.

127
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:15,260
As heavy industry moved into the resource-rich country and progressive-minded policies extended

128
00:09:15,260 --> 00:09:19,820
the grid to black and underprivileged neighborhoods post-apartheid, the margin between power and

129
00:09:19,820 --> 00:09:24,720
needed and power available for shrank then disappeared entirely.

130
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:30,800
And why South Africa failed to take action is also explained by this white paper.

131
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:37,180
White papers, by their very nature, are supposed to be, if not concise, as concise as possible—outlining

132
00:09:37,180 --> 00:09:41,480
specific problems, providing only the context deemed absolutely necessary, and offering

133
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:43,980
a set of specific options forward.

134
00:09:43,980 --> 00:09:46,340
This one runs 110 pages.

135
00:09:47,340 --> 00:09:51,820
And as for problems specifically facing the supply side, well, those aren't addressed

136
00:09:51,820 --> 00:09:56,900
until 41 pages in, when the danger of a potential capacity shortage isn't touched on until

137
00:09:56,900 --> 00:10:02,940
bullet point 8, behind issues of fair access to the grid, environmental concerns, and wasteful

138
00:10:02,940 --> 00:10:03,940
usage.

139
00:10:03,940 --> 00:10:08,760
And as for fixing the problems, there's this—a vague memorandum to expand access

140
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:13,800
and incentivize competition, recommendations both problematically broad and puzzling for

141
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:18,560
Eskom officials who had, to this point, maintained an understanding that as long as it provided

142
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:23,600
cheap electricity and lots of it, the state would keep its hands off.

143
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:28,040
The paper, like the government that authored it, meant well—it properly identified the

144
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:32,460
host of issues, but it pushed the longer-term problems to the back of the line and tried

145
00:10:32,460 --> 00:10:36,380
to radically reform through vague and confusing mandates.

146
00:10:36,380 --> 00:10:41,240
With the grid and beyond it, there was just too much to get to.

147
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:45,920
Some problems the whitepaper identified were addressed by the ANC, as grid access expanded

148
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:50,000
and pathways for black managers to work for the utility and black-owned businesses to

149
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:54,880
contract with the utility were created, but other problems were only made worse as the

150
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:59,560
ANC banned Eskom from building new plants to stimulate competition.

151
00:10:59,560 --> 00:11:04,240
Ultimately, only when no competition appeared and the country began eating too far into

152
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:07,240
its margin did the ANC reverse the ban.

153
00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:11,200
It was too little too late by then, as the nation that had been known for its energy

154
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:16,240
surplus, selling to nearby neighbors and producing megawatt-hour totals nearer to European averages

155
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:21,940
than those for its own continent, was now energy insecure by 2007, with experts saying

156
00:11:21,940 --> 00:11:27,320
that they wouldn't be able to dig themselves out of the hole for another five years.

157
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:32,520
But more than 15 years on, as additional power plants have belatedly come online, the country's

158
00:11:32,520 --> 00:11:36,760
still in the grips of regular rolling blackouts.

159
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:41,120
Across the 2010s, power capacity in South Africa steadily rose.

160
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:47,280
The problem was actual production still stagnated—it's one thing to build the plants, and another

161
00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:48,780
to keep them running.

162
00:11:48,780 --> 00:11:54,080
In late 2014 and early 2015, it was diesel shortages, drought, and plant maintenance

163
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:57,160
that cut national power production short of demand.

164
00:11:57,160 --> 00:12:03,480
In 2019, it was a coal shortage, flooding, and alleged sabotage that led to worse blackouts.

165
00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:08,320
Finally, beginning with maintenance issues in 2021, South Africa entered a spiral into

166
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:10,880
its worst outages ever.

167
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:16,280
Employee strikes in June of 2022, fires and failures in September of 2022, then more plant

168
00:12:16,280 --> 00:12:22,120
failures in 2023 left some cities dark for entire days, while countrywide, blackouts

169
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:28,320
occurred at least once during 200 days of 2022—a new worst.

170
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:32,960
Delayed maintenance, old coal plants, and staff limitations were to blame.

171
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:35,760
But so too was institutional rot.

172
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:42,120
What was supposed to be fixed by ANC overhaul had fallen victim to the same ills plaguing

173
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:44,520
the ANC itself.

174
00:12:44,520 --> 00:12:50,240
With cuts reaching 12 hours a day by the end of 2022, Eskom CEO Andre de Reuter privately

175
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:55,600
resigned—a move which nearly killed him when just hours after, someone slipped a potentially

176
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:58,600
lethal dose of cyanide into his coffee.

177
00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:03,280
In a now-deleted interview revealing this close call, the former CEO went on to accuse

178
00:13:03,280 --> 00:13:08,280
the ANC of institutional corruption, where Eskom served as the feeding trough, with an

179
00:13:08,280 --> 00:13:14,080
estimated $1 billion rand or $52 million being stolen from the state utility every single

180
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:15,160
month.

181
00:13:15,160 --> 00:13:19,720
While such a number is nearly impossible to verify, it would mark only the most direct

182
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:24,600
loss that such widespread and long-lasting blackouts are creating.

183
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:29,640
Inside GDP growth, which the ANC had once hoped to average 6% a year, has touched 4%

184
00:13:29,640 --> 00:13:35,100
only once since power shortages began in 2007, while the South African Reserve Bank has estimated

185
00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:41,860
that blackouts from 6 to 12 hours a day rip about 204 to 899 million rand out of the economy

186
00:13:41,860 --> 00:13:47,240
a day—up to $50 million every single day.

187
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:52,080
Eskom, for its part, has raised electricity rates from the global basement, yet still

188
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:57,800
finds itself under a mountain of debt and unable to consistently keep the lights on.

189
00:13:57,800 --> 00:14:02,360
Confronting this darkness, nearly everyone and everything that feasibly and financially

190
00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:06,760
can are working to isolate themselves from the government—to build self-sufficiency

191
00:14:06,760 --> 00:14:10,520
from the public services that they can no longer rely on.

192
00:14:10,520 --> 00:14:14,880
To start, with police response times often stretching into hours, the wealthy rely on

193
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:19,940
the world's largest private security industry to keep them and their homes safe.

194
00:14:19,940 --> 00:14:24,740
More people are employed by this industry, in fact, than the police and military combined.

195
00:14:24,740 --> 00:14:29,880
That's because nearly every expensive home is plastered with a plaque indicating which

196
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:34,060
of the plethora of armed response security companies they're subscribed to, each of

197
00:14:34,060 --> 00:14:39,020
which patrols the nice neighborhoods and shows up far faster than the police.

198
00:14:39,020 --> 00:14:43,460
Outside of their homes, the life of the wealthy has largely receded from urban downtowns into

199
00:14:43,460 --> 00:14:48,260
places like Santon and Johannesburg or Sea Point in Cape Town—both of which have organized

200
00:14:48,260 --> 00:14:52,780
into city improvement districts where the local private sector groups together and pays

201
00:14:52,780 --> 00:14:58,200
into an organization that ensures safety by hiring private security to patrol the streets.

202
00:14:58,200 --> 00:15:02,820
And some go further—filling potholes, fixing streetlights, cleaning litter, doing all the

203
00:15:02,820 --> 00:15:06,620
things that are the responsibility of the government on paper, but that don't happen

204
00:15:06,620 --> 00:15:09,580
regularly or reliably in practice.

205
00:15:09,580 --> 00:15:13,940
In sum, the proliferation of private security and city improvement districts allows wealthy

206
00:15:13,940 --> 00:15:18,800
areas of the country to maintain a semblance of stability, offering pockets where the day-to-day

207
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:22,680
experience is no different to that of Europe, for example.

208
00:15:22,680 --> 00:15:26,580
And this disconnect with their surroundings goes further for the wealthy few, as one of

209
00:15:26,580 --> 00:15:30,420
the nation's booming industries is now solar installation.

210
00:15:30,420 --> 00:15:34,340
South Africa's total solar capacity has more than doubled in just a year, as those

211
00:15:34,340 --> 00:15:38,780
that can afford it are purchasing setups to allow for stable electricity regardless of

212
00:15:38,780 --> 00:15:39,780
grid conditions.

213
00:15:40,180 --> 00:15:44,660
And as perhaps the penultimate form before emigration, many wealthy residents are preparing

214
00:15:44,660 --> 00:15:49,300
to eliminate their reliance on the South African state entirely by gaining the right to live

215
00:15:49,300 --> 00:15:50,600
abroad.

216
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:55,460
Those that can obtain Australian or UK citizenship based on ancestry are exercising those rights

217
00:15:55,460 --> 00:15:59,900
en masse, while immigration lawyers and nations are increasingly capitalizing on the fears

218
00:15:59,900 --> 00:16:01,900
of those that can't.

219
00:16:01,900 --> 00:16:06,620
Neighboring Namibia, for example, is developing a sprawling golf resort in Walvis Bay that

220
00:16:06,620 --> 00:16:11,940
includes, with the purchase of a condo or home, a renewable work permit for the country.

221
00:16:11,940 --> 00:16:16,580
Malta, St Kitts and Nevis, and others are straight up selling citizenship in exchange

222
00:16:16,580 --> 00:16:21,260
for six-figure so-called investments in the countries, and plenty of South Africans with

223
00:16:21,260 --> 00:16:25,300
the wealth to do so are taking them up on the offer in order to build out their Plan

224
00:16:25,300 --> 00:16:26,300
Bs.

225
00:16:26,300 --> 00:16:31,080
Now, it's not like South Africa hasn't been in a similar state before.

226
00:16:31,080 --> 00:16:35,940
There was a time when crime was as high, there was a time when electricity access was worse,

227
00:16:35,940 --> 00:16:40,860
there was a time when, broadly, it was a less-developed nation than it is today.

228
00:16:40,860 --> 00:16:46,100
But what makes its current reality so grim is that it's in a state of regression—it

229
00:16:46,100 --> 00:16:50,740
is devolving from its previous state as one of the continent's most-developed economies.

230
00:16:50,740 --> 00:16:55,240
And this devolution is morphing into a death spiral.

231
00:16:55,240 --> 00:16:56,980
Look no further than the load shedding.

232
00:16:56,980 --> 00:17:01,260
When the grid is turned off, the lack of dangerous electric currents makes it easy for thieves

233
00:17:01,260 --> 00:17:04,060
to remove copper cables and transformers.

234
00:17:04,060 --> 00:17:08,260
With each theft, the power utility has to divert resources towards fixing these new

235
00:17:08,260 --> 00:17:13,500
issues rather than the generating issues that are causing the blackouts in the first place.

236
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:17,700
This makes the root cause worse, which makes blackouts more common, which makes theft more

237
00:17:17,700 --> 00:17:21,300
common, which makes the root cause worse, and so on.

238
00:17:21,300 --> 00:17:25,060
A certain degree of solution could come from the overarching government, rather than simply

239
00:17:25,060 --> 00:17:30,240
within the power utility itself, but with each power cut, businesses lose money.

240
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:33,800
Production stops, food spoils, thieves steal.

241
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:37,060
The causes are myriad, but the effect is consistent.

242
00:17:37,060 --> 00:17:40,640
Less income, which leads to a lower tax base for the government, which leaves it with less

243
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:44,480
money to bring back around to solve the root cause, which makes blackouts more common,

244
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:48,400
which makes the economic loss higher, which makes the root cause worse, and so on and

245
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:49,960
so on.

246
00:17:49,960 --> 00:17:55,360
As all this occurs, quality of life declines for everyone in South Africa, even the wealthy

247
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:56,360
few.

248
00:17:56,360 --> 00:18:00,080
They have to deal with higher crime, the inconvenience of load shedding, and a weakening economy

249
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:04,680
and Iran exchange rate, which makes purchasing foreign-made goods and services increasingly

250
00:18:04,680 --> 00:18:06,000
out of reach.

251
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:10,760
With a luxury of choice, the rich are emigrating, bringing with them their wealth, knowledge,

252
00:18:10,760 --> 00:18:14,440
and business, which weakens the economy, which makes the government less able to address

253
00:18:14,440 --> 00:18:18,720
the root cause, which makes blackouts more common, which makes more emigrate, which weakens

254
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:21,880
the economy, which makes the government less able to address the root cause, which makes

255
00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:26,280
the root cause worse, and so on and so on and so on.

256
00:18:26,280 --> 00:18:30,380
This death spiral extends society-wide.

257
00:18:30,380 --> 00:18:35,960
It is now a central, unique defining feature of the South African state.

258
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:40,980
As the continent's poverty rate plummets, South Africa's is rising.

259
00:18:40,980 --> 00:18:45,800
As the continent's human development rates go up, South Africa's declines.

260
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:50,500
As almost every indicator of human and economic progress improves on the continent, South

261
00:18:50,500 --> 00:18:52,000
Africa's regresses.

262
00:18:52,520 --> 00:18:57,160
That's to say, this isn't some systematic issue, there isn't some force of nature

263
00:18:57,160 --> 00:19:03,680
making the nation's decline inevitable, which leaves just one other possible culprit—the

264
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:05,480
government.

265
00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:09,200
Support for the African National Congress, once synonymous with the support for the end

266
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:12,560
of apartheid, has reached an all-time low.

267
00:19:12,560 --> 00:19:17,080
2021 was the first municipal election that saw their share of the national vote drop

268
00:19:17,080 --> 00:19:18,760
below 50%.

269
00:19:18,760 --> 00:19:23,440
Only every issue has only escalated since then, and new stories of corruption and cronyism

270
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:26,040
within the party emerge every day.

271
00:19:26,040 --> 00:19:32,600
In 2024, the nation will elect a new National Assembly, and, with declining support and

272
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:38,320
a growing coalition in opposition, the ANC is on its most tenuous footing ever, and the

273
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:44,360
country could see functional political plurality for the first time in the post-apartheid era.

274
00:19:44,360 --> 00:19:49,860
Now, as rhetoric focuses on whether South Africa will slide into failed state status,

275
00:19:49,860 --> 00:19:54,680
there is a question worth asking on whether the nation has ever actually been a functional

276
00:19:54,680 --> 00:19:56,020
state.

277
00:19:56,020 --> 00:20:00,160
There was a time when it seemed more stable and prosperous than today, but that was only

278
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:05,260
the part of the nation that one saw on World Cup broadcasts, the part lived in by South

279
00:20:05,260 --> 00:20:10,600
Africans one would meet abroad, more specifically, it was the white nation, while the black nation's

280
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:12,640
voices were stifled.

281
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:16,720
During the apartheid era, South Africa failed to provide basic services of an acceptable

282
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:22,640
standard—sanitation, education, police—to the majority of its population, the black

283
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:24,000
population.

284
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:27,360
By many definitions, that is a failed state.

285
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:32,820
So that's to say, basic services have never been at an acceptable level.

286
00:20:32,820 --> 00:20:37,260
The difference is that today, the deficiency is being shared more equally.

287
00:20:37,260 --> 00:20:41,240
It would have been unrealistic to expect that a standard of living experienced by a privileged

288
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:46,340
minority propped up by oppression itself could immediately extend to all—it was always

289
00:20:46,340 --> 00:20:48,520
going to be a tricky transition.

290
00:20:48,520 --> 00:20:54,400
But tragically, the ANC, the institution most responsible for inciting this transition,

291
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:56,900
is now slowing it down.

292
00:20:56,900 --> 00:21:01,180
Party members are using their positions to steal from the state, to use oppression to

293
00:21:01,180 --> 00:21:06,680
prop up the privileged—the very dynamic they fought to end.

294
00:21:06,680 --> 00:21:10,760
Perhaps the sole light in the situation is the fact that it has worsened enough that

295
00:21:10,760 --> 00:21:15,800
one can identify that the transition is failing—that a new approach is needed.

296
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:19,860
South Africa still has a starting point that would be the envy of most of its continental

297
00:21:19,860 --> 00:21:20,860
neighbors.

298
00:21:20,860 --> 00:21:24,880
It still has a robust economy, a relatively high standard of living, and is naturally

299
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:29,580
indebted with valuable resources, so it's not too late to capitalize on its situation

300
00:21:29,580 --> 00:21:34,900
and create a thriving state that truly works for all, but the window of opportunity is

301
00:21:34,900 --> 00:21:37,900
slowly starting to close.

302
00:21:37,900 --> 00:21:42,580
With each passing day, those with the luxury of choice are giving up—they're packing

303
00:21:42,580 --> 00:21:47,480
their bags and driving to the airport one last time.

304
00:21:47,480 --> 00:21:53,940
With each hour of load shedding, the economy shrinks further, and the death spiral accelerates.

305
00:21:53,940 --> 00:21:59,740
Hope is not lost in South Africa, but with each day that passes, the path towards prosperity

306
00:21:59,740 --> 00:22:03,820
grows ever harder to find.

307
00:22:03,820 --> 00:22:04,820
Finance is tricky.

308
00:22:04,820 --> 00:22:08,400
It's a very easy thing to lose track of, especially as companies increasingly design

309
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:11,620
their services around you for getting your spending money.

310
00:22:11,620 --> 00:22:15,860
Subscriptions especially can really add up, but to help me manage my monthly spending,

311
00:22:15,860 --> 00:22:18,980
I recently started using our sponsor, Rocket Money.

312
00:22:18,980 --> 00:22:23,540
They're an all-in-one finance platform that helps you save more and spend less.

313
00:22:23,540 --> 00:22:27,980
Personally, I find it super useful as a save for a down payment on a house, as I can build

314
00:22:27,980 --> 00:22:32,380
my custom budget that automatically monitors my spending by category, plus monitor my credit

315
00:22:32,380 --> 00:22:36,220
score to make sure I raise it as much as possible to get a good interest rate, and

316
00:22:36,220 --> 00:22:39,940
it even allows me to automatically deposit a certain amount of money into a smart savings

317
00:22:39,940 --> 00:22:42,540
account to grow my savings even more.

318
00:22:42,540 --> 00:22:47,500
Personally, I really like having Rocket Money as my all-in-one solution to money management,

319
00:22:47,500 --> 00:22:50,940
rather than having to use a bunch of different apps that don't really work together, and

00:22:50,940 --> 00:22:55,440
if you happen to be one of those very common people who want to save more and spend less,

321
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:59,620
you can go to rocketmoney.com slash wendover or click the link in the description to get

322
00:22:59,620 --> 00:23:03,300
started for free, and then you can unlock even more features with Premium.
