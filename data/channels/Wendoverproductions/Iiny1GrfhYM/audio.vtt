00:00.000 --> 00:04.320
For a moment, there was so much hope.

00:04.320 --> 00:05.320
Apartheid was over.

00:05.320 --> 00:10.760
South Africa had, for decades, essentially operated as two different nations superimposed

00:10.760 --> 00:12.520
on the same landscape.

00:12.520 --> 00:17.680
There was the white nation, wealthy and westernized, boasting a similar, if not higher standard

00:17.680 --> 00:22.540
of living to that of Europe due to its similarly strong and diversified economy.

00:22.540 --> 00:27.040
Then there was the black nation, impoverished and excluded from that wealthier white nation

00:27.040 --> 00:30.940
by a legally enshrined system of segregation.

00:30.940 --> 00:36.440
It felt like Europeans had just built an insular outpost in Africa—that's to say, it felt

00:36.440 --> 00:38.240
like what it was.

00:38.240 --> 00:42.520
But finally, following decades of internal struggle and mounting international pressure

00:42.520 --> 00:47.660
that reached a climax with the waning need for an African anti-Soviet ally, the nation's

00:47.660 --> 00:51.980
new president announced the release of apartheid-era political prisoners.

00:51.980 --> 00:56.680
Most of these prisoners were members of the African National Congress, the strongest anti-apartheid

00:56.720 --> 01:01.640
force, including the famed and beloved Nelson Mandela.

01:01.640 --> 01:06.320
As time marched forward, Mandela negotiated with the existing government to ensure a peaceful

01:06.320 --> 01:10.960
transition—something some thought impossible, as the structures of apartheid were stripped

01:10.960 --> 01:11.960
away.

01:11.960 --> 01:17.760
Then, in South Africa's first truly democratic election, the most symbolic moment yet—Nelson

01:17.760 --> 01:23.520
Mandela, the former prisoner, was elected President of South Africa.

01:23.520 --> 01:28.540
In the view of most, at that moment, South Africa was brimming with potential.

01:28.540 --> 01:34.360
It had massive mineral wealth, it had a diversified economy, it had a large, highly educated workforce.

01:34.360 --> 01:39.340
As the continent rose, the world hoped and believed that South Africa could be the poster

01:39.340 --> 01:43.120
child of the potential of African economic and human development.

01:43.120 --> 01:47.600
If the white and black nations could truly integrate into one, the country was well on

01:47.600 --> 01:53.480
its way towards being considered a social and economic equivalent to, say, New Zealand.

01:53.480 --> 01:57.040
Another former British colony in the Southern Hemisphere that managed to transition into

01:57.040 --> 02:01.240
a self-sufficient, high-income, multicultural society.

02:01.240 --> 02:06.400
Crucial to this, perhaps the greatest task that Mandela and his ANC party was faced with

02:06.400 --> 02:09.560
was how to build a black middle class.

02:09.560 --> 02:13.600
The legally enshrined systems of segregation were easy to do away with—they could be

02:13.600 --> 02:18.480
reversed in an instant—but what was left was a massive population trapped in the cycle

02:18.480 --> 02:19.720
of poverty.

02:19.720 --> 02:24.120
Simultaneously, there was the wealthy white population at the center of the current economic

02:24.120 --> 02:28.400
system who would not tolerate a simple redistribution of wealth.

02:28.400 --> 02:34.200
So, the ANC had to thread the needle—correct for historical wrongs while maintaining most

02:34.200 --> 02:35.720
of the status quo.

02:35.720 --> 02:39.160
Initially, they were fairly successful at this.

02:39.160 --> 02:43.920
The beginnings came naturally as black party members moved into many of the stable, well-compensated

02:43.920 --> 02:48.600
public sector jobs previously held by the white minority, then the trend permeated elsewhere

02:48.600 --> 02:53.560
as qualified individuals excluded only due to the color of their skin entered every other

02:53.560 --> 02:56.160
newly desegregated profession.

02:56.160 --> 03:00.800
Formerly impoverished townships like Soweto metamorphosed from slums into sprawling suburban

03:00.800 --> 03:05.800
neighborhoods filled with rows of single-family homes and ample assortments of upscale restaurants

03:05.800 --> 03:06.800
and bars.

03:06.800 --> 03:12.000
And crucially, this wasn't due to wealth moving in, but rather wealth being built—the

03:12.000 --> 03:16.360
white population of Soweto stayed at just a fraction of a percent.

03:16.360 --> 03:20.720
More broadly, nationwide, according to one study's definition, the black middle class

03:20.720 --> 03:27.360
grew from just 1.7 million in 2004 to 4.2 million just eight years later.

03:27.360 --> 03:31.600
As perhaps the strongest validation of South Africa's progress so far, the nation was

03:31.600 --> 03:37.080
selected to host the 2010 FIFA World Cup, an event that had never before taken place

03:37.080 --> 03:39.240
on the African continent.

03:39.240 --> 03:41.720
This sent a message.

03:41.720 --> 03:47.320
It said that, of anywhere in Africa, South Africa was the place most capable of hosting

03:47.320 --> 03:50.600
the world's second highest profile sporting event.

03:50.600 --> 03:52.940
Inevitably, naysayers arose.

03:52.940 --> 03:57.160
They said the nation couldn't possibly build the stadiums in time, then when they did,

03:57.160 --> 04:01.520
they said the stadiums were shoddy and would crumble apart, then when they didn't, they

04:01.520 --> 04:06.160
said that fans wouldn't possibly show up fearful for their lives in crime-riddled South

04:06.160 --> 04:09.720
African streets, but they certainly did.

04:09.720 --> 04:14.720
As the sound of vuvuzillas engulfed the TV broadcasts, the world was captivated by the

04:14.720 --> 04:20.360
host country, and it was now thought of in the same vein as Germany, or Japan, or France,

04:20.360 --> 04:23.480
or any of the other World Cup hosts.

04:23.480 --> 04:29.300
But eventually, Spain bested the Netherlands, the TV broadcasts wrapped up, the lights of

04:29.300 --> 04:34.440
Soccer City Stadium switched off, the fans flew home, the years marched on, and time

04:34.440 --> 04:37.160
revealed an uncomfortable truth.

04:37.720 --> 04:41.760
While the government was able to emulate stability for the short period, they were able to create

04:41.760 --> 04:47.640
a facsimile of the experience in Germany or Japan or France, it didn't last.

04:47.640 --> 04:49.540
Progress had stagnated.

04:49.540 --> 04:52.920
It might have actually reversed.

04:52.920 --> 04:58.400
This is perhaps best represented by this, the least popular document in South Africa.

04:58.400 --> 05:03.200
Nowadays, it's published each month by the government-owned power utility, ESCOM, and

05:03.240 --> 05:08.980
outlines the schedule of when each municipality will have their electricity supply shut off.

05:08.980 --> 05:12.800
After decades of deferred maintenance on a power system mostly designed to service the

05:12.800 --> 05:18.380
white minority, plant failures have escalated this issue into a chronic mismatch between

05:18.380 --> 05:20.360
supply and demand.

05:20.360 --> 05:26.140
That creates this dissonance—a country that, in part, looks as developed as the most upscale

05:26.140 --> 05:32.800
areas in Europe, yet is plunged into darkness as frequently as its poorest African neighbors.

05:33.400 --> 05:36.320
These days, a lack of load shedding is the exception.

05:36.320 --> 05:44.260
So far in 2023, there have been 5,858 hours when the grid has failed to meet demand.

05:44.260 --> 05:48.460
But while perhaps the most palpable issue that creates some of the most sizable domino

05:48.460 --> 05:54.520
effects, South Africa is increasingly failing to provide the absolute bare bones of public

05:54.520 --> 05:55.520
services.

05:55.520 --> 06:00.760
In 2018, Cape Town nearly became the first major city anywhere to run out of water, as

06:00.760 --> 06:06.120
the city's reservoirs ran dry during a drought—a crisis created in part by a lack

06:06.120 --> 06:10.400
of government foresight—but more broadly and regularly, the share of households with

06:10.400 --> 06:15.600
access to drinking water has started to decline in recent years.

06:15.600 --> 06:20.120
Water infrastructure is crumbling, and just recently, dozens have died on the outskirts

06:20.120 --> 06:25.420
of Pretoria, the administrative capital, due to cholera—a disease virtually eliminated

06:25.420 --> 06:28.840
from the modern world thanks to modern sanitation systems.

06:28.840 --> 06:33.640
The nation's homicide rate is skyrocketing, climbing up towards its all-time high, and

06:33.640 --> 06:39.340
the police and judiciary appear entirely ineffective at combating this as just 20% of murders end

06:39.340 --> 06:44.440
up with anyone in court, and even then, just 31% of the public has trust in the courts

06:44.440 --> 06:47.440
as the legal system breaks down as well.

06:47.440 --> 06:51.920
South Africa's state-owned freight rail monopoly, Transnet, is too collapsing, in

06:51.920 --> 06:57.160
a very similar situation to Eskom as it closes lines, struggles to keep locomotives running,

06:57.160 --> 07:03.080
and carries 25% less cargo today than in 2015—a massive constraint for the country's

07:03.080 --> 07:06.240
lucrative export-focused industrial sector.

07:06.240 --> 07:12.080
South African Airways, which was separated from Transnet in 2006 but remained government-owned,

07:12.080 --> 07:17.480
fully collapsed and ceased all operations in 2020 before restarting with new financing

07:17.480 --> 07:22.160
as an embarrassing shell of its previously globe-spanning self.

07:22.160 --> 07:26.680
No matter where one looks, one struggles to find any case where government service is

07:27.200 --> 07:32.680
improving in South Africa, and the closer one looks, the more sense this starts to make.

07:32.680 --> 07:38.800
When the blackouts began in 2007, they were little more than random, local, short-lasted,

07:38.800 --> 07:40.560
inconvenient irregularities.

07:40.560 --> 07:46.500
Then, in the January heat of the southern summer, they got a lot worse.

07:46.500 --> 07:51.280
With demand surging past supply, tourists sat stranded in cable cars high above Cape

07:51.280 --> 07:56.140
Town, mines evacuated miners from shafts that they could no longer ventilate or cool, and

07:56.140 --> 07:59.860
the South African government declared a national emergency.

07:59.860 --> 08:04.360
The panic power cuts made international news and tipped global markets as the price of

08:04.360 --> 08:09.440
gold and platinum shot skyward after announcement that mines might not open for another six

08:09.440 --> 08:10.580
weeks.

08:10.580 --> 08:14.800
It was not the first load shedding that Eskom had mandated in recent months, but it was

08:14.800 --> 08:16.500
by far the worst.

08:16.500 --> 08:18.620
And it was right on time.

08:18.620 --> 08:23.420
In fact, this very moment, when South Africa's mighty grid was catastrophically overstretched

08:23.420 --> 08:30.000
by its consumers, had been predicted to nearly the exact year in this 1998 white paper.

08:30.000 --> 08:34.740
As the paper had estimated, should no action be taken to expand power supply in South Africa,

08:34.740 --> 08:40.980
the country's surplus, then sitting at a healthy 25% in 1997, would evaporate away

08:40.980 --> 08:43.740
by about 2007.

08:43.740 --> 08:46.260
And no action was taken.

08:46.260 --> 08:49.900
For all that changed politically and socially with the end of apartheid and the rise of

08:49.900 --> 08:54.740
the AMC, South Africa's grid on the supply side just didn't.

08:54.740 --> 08:59.580
Of the nation's 15 separate power plants capable of producing more than 1,000 megawatts,

08:59.580 --> 09:05.220
only these two came online during the period from 1990 to 2008, while these two were hastily

09:05.220 --> 09:10.840
brought back into production having been mothballed decades prior when the country was power flush.

09:10.840 --> 09:15.260
As heavy industry moved into the resource-rich country and progressive-minded policies extended

09:15.260 --> 09:19.820
the grid to black and underprivileged neighborhoods post-apartheid, the margin between power and

09:19.820 --> 09:24.720
needed and power available for shrank then disappeared entirely.

09:24.720 --> 09:30.800
And why South Africa failed to take action is also explained by this white paper.

09:30.800 --> 09:37.180
White papers, by their very nature, are supposed to be, if not concise, as concise as possible—outlining

09:37.180 --> 09:41.480
specific problems, providing only the context deemed absolutely necessary, and offering

09:41.480 --> 09:43.980
a set of specific options forward.

09:43.980 --> 09:46.340
This one runs 110 pages.

09:47.340 --> 09:51.820
And as for problems specifically facing the supply side, well, those aren't addressed

09:51.820 --> 09:56.900
until 41 pages in, when the danger of a potential capacity shortage isn't touched on until

09:56.900 --> 10:02.940
bullet point 8, behind issues of fair access to the grid, environmental concerns, and wasteful

10:02.940 --> 10:03.940
usage.

10:03.940 --> 10:08.760
And as for fixing the problems, there's this—a vague memorandum to expand access

10:08.760 --> 10:13.800
and incentivize competition, recommendations both problematically broad and puzzling for

10:13.800 --> 10:18.560
Eskom officials who had, to this point, maintained an understanding that as long as it provided

10:18.560 --> 10:23.600
cheap electricity and lots of it, the state would keep its hands off.

10:23.600 --> 10:28.040
The paper, like the government that authored it, meant well—it properly identified the

10:28.040 --> 10:32.460
host of issues, but it pushed the longer-term problems to the back of the line and tried

10:32.460 --> 10:36.380
to radically reform through vague and confusing mandates.

10:36.380 --> 10:41.240
With the grid and beyond it, there was just too much to get to.

10:41.240 --> 10:45.920
Some problems the whitepaper identified were addressed by the ANC, as grid access expanded

10:45.920 --> 10:50.000
and pathways for black managers to work for the utility and black-owned businesses to

10:50.000 --> 10:54.880
contract with the utility were created, but other problems were only made worse as the

10:54.880 --> 10:59.560
ANC banned Eskom from building new plants to stimulate competition.

10:59.560 --> 11:04.240
Ultimately, only when no competition appeared and the country began eating too far into

11:04.240 --> 11:07.240
its margin did the ANC reverse the ban.

11:07.240 --> 11:11.200
It was too little too late by then, as the nation that had been known for its energy

11:11.200 --> 11:16.240
surplus, selling to nearby neighbors and producing megawatt-hour totals nearer to European averages

11:16.240 --> 11:21.940
than those for its own continent, was now energy insecure by 2007, with experts saying

11:21.940 --> 11:27.320
that they wouldn't be able to dig themselves out of the hole for another five years.

11:27.320 --> 11:32.520
But more than 15 years on, as additional power plants have belatedly come online, the country's

11:32.520 --> 11:36.760
still in the grips of regular rolling blackouts.

11:37.280 --> 11:41.120
Across the 2010s, power capacity in South Africa steadily rose.

11:41.120 --> 11:47.280
The problem was actual production still stagnated—it's one thing to build the plants, and another

11:47.280 --> 11:48.780
to keep them running.

11:48.780 --> 11:54.080
In late 2014 and early 2015, it was diesel shortages, drought, and plant maintenance

11:54.080 --> 11:57.160
that cut national power production short of demand.

11:57.160 --> 12:03.480
In 2019, it was a coal shortage, flooding, and alleged sabotage that led to worse blackouts.

12:03.520 --> 12:08.320
Finally, beginning with maintenance issues in 2021, South Africa entered a spiral into

12:08.320 --> 12:10.880
its worst outages ever.

12:10.880 --> 12:16.280
Employee strikes in June of 2022, fires and failures in September of 2022, then more plant

12:16.280 --> 12:22.120
failures in 2023 left some cities dark for entire days, while countrywide, blackouts

12:22.120 --> 12:28.320
occurred at least once during 200 days of 2022—a new worst.

12:28.320 --> 12:32.960
Delayed maintenance, old coal plants, and staff limitations were to blame.

12:32.960 --> 12:35.760
But so too was institutional rot.

12:35.760 --> 12:42.120
What was supposed to be fixed by ANC overhaul had fallen victim to the same ills plaguing

12:42.120 --> 12:44.520
the ANC itself.

12:44.520 --> 12:50.240
With cuts reaching 12 hours a day by the end of 2022, Eskom CEO Andre de Reuter privately

12:50.240 --> 12:55.600
resigned—a move which nearly killed him when just hours after, someone slipped a potentially

12:55.600 --> 12:58.600
lethal dose of cyanide into his coffee.

12:58.600 --> 13:03.280
In a now-deleted interview revealing this close call, the former CEO went on to accuse

13:03.280 --> 13:08.280
the ANC of institutional corruption, where Eskom served as the feeding trough, with an

13:08.280 --> 13:14.080
estimated $1 billion rand or $52 million being stolen from the state utility every single

13:14.080 --> 13:15.160
month.

13:15.160 --> 13:19.720
While such a number is nearly impossible to verify, it would mark only the most direct

13:19.720 --> 13:24.600
loss that such widespread and long-lasting blackouts are creating.

13:24.600 --> 13:29.640
Inside GDP growth, which the ANC had once hoped to average 6% a year, has touched 4%

13:29.640 --> 13:35.100
only once since power shortages began in 2007, while the South African Reserve Bank has estimated

13:35.100 --> 13:41.860
that blackouts from 6 to 12 hours a day rip about 204 to 899 million rand out of the economy

13:41.860 --> 13:47.240
a day—up to $50 million every single day.

13:47.240 --> 13:52.080
Eskom, for its part, has raised electricity rates from the global basement, yet still

13:52.080 --> 13:57.800
finds itself under a mountain of debt and unable to consistently keep the lights on.

13:57.800 --> 14:02.360
Confronting this darkness, nearly everyone and everything that feasibly and financially

14:02.360 --> 14:06.760
can are working to isolate themselves from the government—to build self-sufficiency

14:06.760 --> 14:10.520
from the public services that they can no longer rely on.

14:10.520 --> 14:14.880
To start, with police response times often stretching into hours, the wealthy rely on

14:14.880 --> 14:19.940
the world's largest private security industry to keep them and their homes safe.

14:19.940 --> 14:24.740
More people are employed by this industry, in fact, than the police and military combined.

14:24.740 --> 14:29.880
That's because nearly every expensive home is plastered with a plaque indicating which

14:29.880 --> 14:34.060
of the plethora of armed response security companies they're subscribed to, each of

14:34.060 --> 14:39.020
which patrols the nice neighborhoods and shows up far faster than the police.

14:39.020 --> 14:43.460
Outside of their homes, the life of the wealthy has largely receded from urban downtowns into

14:43.460 --> 14:48.260
places like Santon and Johannesburg or Sea Point in Cape Town—both of which have organized

14:48.260 --> 14:52.780
into city improvement districts where the local private sector groups together and pays

14:52.780 --> 14:58.200
into an organization that ensures safety by hiring private security to patrol the streets.

14:58.200 --> 15:02.820
And some go further—filling potholes, fixing streetlights, cleaning litter, doing all the

15:02.820 --> 15:06.620
things that are the responsibility of the government on paper, but that don't happen

15:06.620 --> 15:09.580
regularly or reliably in practice.

15:09.580 --> 15:13.940
In sum, the proliferation of private security and city improvement districts allows wealthy

15:13.940 --> 15:18.800
areas of the country to maintain a semblance of stability, offering pockets where the day-to-day

15:18.800 --> 15:22.680
experience is no different to that of Europe, for example.

15:22.680 --> 15:26.580
And this disconnect with their surroundings goes further for the wealthy few, as one of

15:26.580 --> 15:30.420
the nation's booming industries is now solar installation.

15:30.420 --> 15:34.340
South Africa's total solar capacity has more than doubled in just a year, as those

15:34.340 --> 15:38.780
that can afford it are purchasing setups to allow for stable electricity regardless of

15:38.780 --> 15:39.780
grid conditions.

15:40.180 --> 15:44.660
And as perhaps the penultimate form before emigration, many wealthy residents are preparing

15:44.660 --> 15:49.300
to eliminate their reliance on the South African state entirely by gaining the right to live

15:49.300 --> 15:50.600
abroad.

15:50.600 --> 15:55.460
Those that can obtain Australian or UK citizenship based on ancestry are exercising those rights

15:55.460 --> 15:59.900
en masse, while immigration lawyers and nations are increasingly capitalizing on the fears

15:59.900 --> 16:01.900
of those that can't.

16:01.900 --> 16:06.620
Neighboring Namibia, for example, is developing a sprawling golf resort in Walvis Bay that

16:06.620 --> 16:11.940
includes, with the purchase of a condo or home, a renewable work permit for the country.

16:11.940 --> 16:16.580
Malta, St Kitts and Nevis, and others are straight up selling citizenship in exchange

16:16.580 --> 16:21.260
for six-figure so-called investments in the countries, and plenty of South Africans with

16:21.260 --> 16:25.300
the wealth to do so are taking them up on the offer in order to build out their Plan

16:25.300 --> 16:26.300
Bs.

16:26.300 --> 16:31.080
Now, it's not like South Africa hasn't been in a similar state before.

16:31.080 --> 16:35.940
There was a time when crime was as high, there was a time when electricity access was worse,

16:35.940 --> 16:40.860
there was a time when, broadly, it was a less-developed nation than it is today.

16:40.860 --> 16:46.100
But what makes its current reality so grim is that it's in a state of regression—it

16:46.100 --> 16:50.740
is devolving from its previous state as one of the continent's most-developed economies.

16:50.740 --> 16:55.240
And this devolution is morphing into a death spiral.

16:55.240 --> 16:56.980
Look no further than the load shedding.

16:56.980 --> 17:01.260
When the grid is turned off, the lack of dangerous electric currents makes it easy for thieves

17:01.260 --> 17:04.060
to remove copper cables and transformers.

17:04.060 --> 17:08.260
With each theft, the power utility has to divert resources towards fixing these new

17:08.260 --> 17:13.500
issues rather than the generating issues that are causing the blackouts in the first place.

17:13.500 --> 17:17.700
This makes the root cause worse, which makes blackouts more common, which makes theft more

17:17.700 --> 17:21.300
common, which makes the root cause worse, and so on.

17:21.300 --> 17:25.060
A certain degree of solution could come from the overarching government, rather than simply

17:25.060 --> 17:30.240
within the power utility itself, but with each power cut, businesses lose money.

17:30.240 --> 17:33.800
Production stops, food spoils, thieves steal.

17:33.800 --> 17:37.060
The causes are myriad, but the effect is consistent.

17:37.060 --> 17:40.640
Less income, which leads to a lower tax base for the government, which leaves it with less

17:40.640 --> 17:44.480
money to bring back around to solve the root cause, which makes blackouts more common,

17:44.480 --> 17:48.400
which makes the economic loss higher, which makes the root cause worse, and so on and

17:48.400 --> 17:49.960
so on.

17:49.960 --> 17:55.360
As all this occurs, quality of life declines for everyone in South Africa, even the wealthy

17:55.360 --> 17:56.360
few.

17:56.360 --> 18:00.080
They have to deal with higher crime, the inconvenience of load shedding, and a weakening economy

18:00.080 --> 18:04.680
and Iran exchange rate, which makes purchasing foreign-made goods and services increasingly

18:04.680 --> 18:06.000
out of reach.

18:06.000 --> 18:10.760
With a luxury of choice, the rich are emigrating, bringing with them their wealth, knowledge,

18:10.760 --> 18:14.440
and business, which weakens the economy, which makes the government less able to address

18:14.440 --> 18:18.720
the root cause, which makes blackouts more common, which makes more emigrate, which weakens

18:18.720 --> 18:21.880
the economy, which makes the government less able to address the root cause, which makes

18:21.880 --> 18:26.280
the root cause worse, and so on and so on and so on.

18:26.280 --> 18:30.380
This death spiral extends society-wide.

18:30.380 --> 18:35.960
It is now a central, unique defining feature of the South African state.

18:35.960 --> 18:40.980
As the continent's poverty rate plummets, South Africa's is rising.

18:40.980 --> 18:45.800
As the continent's human development rates go up, South Africa's declines.

18:45.800 --> 18:50.500
As almost every indicator of human and economic progress improves on the continent, South

18:50.500 --> 18:52.000
Africa's regresses.

18:52.520 --> 18:57.160
That's to say, this isn't some systematic issue, there isn't some force of nature

18:57.160 --> 19:03.680
making the nation's decline inevitable, which leaves just one other possible culprit—the

19:03.680 --> 19:05.480
government.

19:05.480 --> 19:09.200
Support for the African National Congress, once synonymous with the support for the end

19:09.200 --> 19:12.560
of apartheid, has reached an all-time low.

19:12.560 --> 19:17.080
2021 was the first municipal election that saw their share of the national vote drop

19:17.080 --> 19:18.760
below 50%.

19:18.760 --> 19:23.440
Only every issue has only escalated since then, and new stories of corruption and cronyism

19:23.440 --> 19:26.040
within the party emerge every day.

19:26.040 --> 19:32.600
In 2024, the nation will elect a new National Assembly, and, with declining support and

19:32.600 --> 19:38.320
a growing coalition in opposition, the ANC is on its most tenuous footing ever, and the

19:38.320 --> 19:44.360
country could see functional political plurality for the first time in the post-apartheid era.

19:44.360 --> 19:49.860
Now, as rhetoric focuses on whether South Africa will slide into failed state status,

19:49.860 --> 19:54.680
there is a question worth asking on whether the nation has ever actually been a functional

19:54.680 --> 19:56.020
state.

19:56.020 --> 20:00.160
There was a time when it seemed more stable and prosperous than today, but that was only

20:00.160 --> 20:05.260
the part of the nation that one saw on World Cup broadcasts, the part lived in by South

20:05.260 --> 20:10.600
Africans one would meet abroad, more specifically, it was the white nation, while the black nation's

20:10.600 --> 20:12.640
voices were stifled.

20:12.640 --> 20:16.720
During the apartheid era, South Africa failed to provide basic services of an acceptable

20:16.720 --> 20:22.640
standard—sanitation, education, police—to the majority of its population, the black

20:22.640 --> 20:24.000
population.

20:24.000 --> 20:27.360
By many definitions, that is a failed state.

20:27.360 --> 20:32.820
So that's to say, basic services have never been at an acceptable level.

20:32.820 --> 20:37.260
The difference is that today, the deficiency is being shared more equally.

20:37.260 --> 20:41.240
It would have been unrealistic to expect that a standard of living experienced by a privileged

20:41.240 --> 20:46.340
minority propped up by oppression itself could immediately extend to all—it was always

20:46.340 --> 20:48.520
going to be a tricky transition.

20:48.520 --> 20:54.400
But tragically, the ANC, the institution most responsible for inciting this transition,

20:54.400 --> 20:56.900
is now slowing it down.

20:56.900 --> 21:01.180
Party members are using their positions to steal from the state, to use oppression to

21:01.180 --> 21:06.680
prop up the privileged—the very dynamic they fought to end.

21:06.680 --> 21:10.760
Perhaps the sole light in the situation is the fact that it has worsened enough that

21:10.760 --> 21:15.800
one can identify that the transition is failing—that a new approach is needed.

21:15.800 --> 21:19.860
South Africa still has a starting point that would be the envy of most of its continental

21:19.860 --> 21:20.860
neighbors.

21:20.860 --> 21:24.880
It still has a robust economy, a relatively high standard of living, and is naturally

21:24.880 --> 21:29.580
indebted with valuable resources, so it's not too late to capitalize on its situation

21:29.580 --> 21:34.900
and create a thriving state that truly works for all, but the window of opportunity is

21:34.900 --> 21:37.900
slowly starting to close.

21:37.900 --> 21:42.580
With each passing day, those with the luxury of choice are giving up—they're packing

21:42.580 --> 21:47.480
their bags and driving to the airport one last time.

21:47.480 --> 21:53.940
With each hour of load shedding, the economy shrinks further, and the death spiral accelerates.

21:53.940 --> 21:59.740
Hope is not lost in South Africa, but with each day that passes, the path towards prosperity

21:59.740 --> 22:03.820
grows ever harder to find.

22:03.820 --> 22:04.820
Finance is tricky.

22:04.820 --> 22:08.400
It's a very easy thing to lose track of, especially as companies increasingly design

22:08.400 --> 22:11.620
their services around you for getting your spending money.

22:11.620 --> 22:15.860
Subscriptions especially can really add up, but to help me manage my monthly spending,

22:15.860 --> 22:18.980
I recently started using our sponsor, Rocket Money.

22:18.980 --> 22:23.540
They're an all-in-one finance platform that helps you save more and spend less.

22:23.540 --> 22:27.980
Personally, I find it super useful as a save for a down payment on a house, as I can build

22:27.980 --> 22:32.380
my custom budget that automatically monitors my spending by category, plus monitor my credit

22:32.380 --> 22:36.220
score to make sure I raise it as much as possible to get a good interest rate, and

22:36.220 --> 22:39.940
it even allows me to automatically deposit a certain amount of money into a smart savings

22:39.940 --> 22:42.540
account to grow my savings even more.

22:42.540 --> 22:47.500
Personally, I really like having Rocket Money as my all-in-one solution to money management,

22:47.500 --> 22:50.940
rather than having to use a bunch of different apps that don't really work together, and

22:50.940 --> 22:55.440
if you happen to be one of those very common people who want to save more and spend less,

22:55.440 --> 22:59.620
you can go to rocketmoney.com slash wendover or click the link in the description to get

22:59.620 --> 23:03.300
