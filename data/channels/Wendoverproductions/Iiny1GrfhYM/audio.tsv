0	4320	For a moment, there was so much hope.
4320	5320	Apartheid was over.
5320	10760	South Africa had, for decades, essentially operated as two different nations superimposed
10760	12520	on the same landscape.
12520	17680	There was the white nation, wealthy and westernized, boasting a similar, if not higher standard
17680	22540	of living to that of Europe due to its similarly strong and diversified economy.
22540	27040	Then there was the black nation, impoverished and excluded from that wealthier white nation
27040	30940	by a legally enshrined system of segregation.
30940	36440	It felt like Europeans had just built an insular outpost in Africa—that's to say, it felt
36440	38240	like what it was.
38240	42520	But finally, following decades of internal struggle and mounting international pressure
42520	47660	that reached a climax with the waning need for an African anti-Soviet ally, the nation's
47660	51980	new president announced the release of apartheid-era political prisoners.
51980	56680	Most of these prisoners were members of the African National Congress, the strongest anti-apartheid
56720	61640	force, including the famed and beloved Nelson Mandela.
61640	66320	As time marched forward, Mandela negotiated with the existing government to ensure a peaceful
66320	70960	transition—something some thought impossible, as the structures of apartheid were stripped
70960	71960	away.
71960	77760	Then, in South Africa's first truly democratic election, the most symbolic moment yet—Nelson
77760	83520	Mandela, the former prisoner, was elected President of South Africa.
83520	88540	In the view of most, at that moment, South Africa was brimming with potential.
88540	94360	It had massive mineral wealth, it had a diversified economy, it had a large, highly educated workforce.
94360	99340	As the continent rose, the world hoped and believed that South Africa could be the poster
99340	103120	child of the potential of African economic and human development.
103120	107600	If the white and black nations could truly integrate into one, the country was well on
107600	113480	its way towards being considered a social and economic equivalent to, say, New Zealand.
113480	117040	Another former British colony in the Southern Hemisphere that managed to transition into
117040	121240	a self-sufficient, high-income, multicultural society.
121240	126400	Crucial to this, perhaps the greatest task that Mandela and his ANC party was faced with
126400	129560	was how to build a black middle class.
129560	133600	The legally enshrined systems of segregation were easy to do away with—they could be
133600	138480	reversed in an instant—but what was left was a massive population trapped in the cycle
138480	139720	of poverty.
139720	144120	Simultaneously, there was the wealthy white population at the center of the current economic
144120	148400	system who would not tolerate a simple redistribution of wealth.
148400	154200	So, the ANC had to thread the needle—correct for historical wrongs while maintaining most
154200	155720	of the status quo.
155720	159160	Initially, they were fairly successful at this.
159160	163920	The beginnings came naturally as black party members moved into many of the stable, well-compensated
163920	168600	public sector jobs previously held by the white minority, then the trend permeated elsewhere
168600	173560	as qualified individuals excluded only due to the color of their skin entered every other
173560	176160	newly desegregated profession.
176160	180800	Formerly impoverished townships like Soweto metamorphosed from slums into sprawling suburban
180800	185800	neighborhoods filled with rows of single-family homes and ample assortments of upscale restaurants
185800	186800	and bars.
186800	192000	And crucially, this wasn't due to wealth moving in, but rather wealth being built—the
192000	196360	white population of Soweto stayed at just a fraction of a percent.
196360	200720	More broadly, nationwide, according to one study's definition, the black middle class
200720	207360	grew from just 1.7 million in 2004 to 4.2 million just eight years later.
207360	211600	As perhaps the strongest validation of South Africa's progress so far, the nation was
211600	217080	selected to host the 2010 FIFA World Cup, an event that had never before taken place
217080	219240	on the African continent.
219240	221720	This sent a message.
221720	227320	It said that, of anywhere in Africa, South Africa was the place most capable of hosting
227320	230600	the world's second highest profile sporting event.
230600	232940	Inevitably, naysayers arose.
232940	237160	They said the nation couldn't possibly build the stadiums in time, then when they did,
237160	241520	they said the stadiums were shoddy and would crumble apart, then when they didn't, they
241520	246160	said that fans wouldn't possibly show up fearful for their lives in crime-riddled South
246160	249720	African streets, but they certainly did.
249720	254720	As the sound of vuvuzillas engulfed the TV broadcasts, the world was captivated by the
254720	260360	host country, and it was now thought of in the same vein as Germany, or Japan, or France,
260360	263480	or any of the other World Cup hosts.
263480	269300	But eventually, Spain bested the Netherlands, the TV broadcasts wrapped up, the lights of
269300	274440	Soccer City Stadium switched off, the fans flew home, the years marched on, and time
274440	277160	revealed an uncomfortable truth.
277720	281760	While the government was able to emulate stability for the short period, they were able to create
281760	287640	a facsimile of the experience in Germany or Japan or France, it didn't last.
287640	289540	Progress had stagnated.
289540	292920	It might have actually reversed.
292920	298400	This is perhaps best represented by this, the least popular document in South Africa.
298400	303200	Nowadays, it's published each month by the government-owned power utility, ESCOM, and
303240	308980	outlines the schedule of when each municipality will have their electricity supply shut off.
308980	312800	After decades of deferred maintenance on a power system mostly designed to service the
312800	318380	white minority, plant failures have escalated this issue into a chronic mismatch between
318380	320360	supply and demand.
320360	326140	That creates this dissonance—a country that, in part, looks as developed as the most upscale
326140	332800	areas in Europe, yet is plunged into darkness as frequently as its poorest African neighbors.
333400	336320	These days, a lack of load shedding is the exception.
336320	344260	So far in 2023, there have been 5,858 hours when the grid has failed to meet demand.
344260	348460	But while perhaps the most palpable issue that creates some of the most sizable domino
348460	354520	effects, South Africa is increasingly failing to provide the absolute bare bones of public
354520	355520	services.
355520	360760	In 2018, Cape Town nearly became the first major city anywhere to run out of water, as
360760	366120	the city's reservoirs ran dry during a drought—a crisis created in part by a lack
366120	370400	of government foresight—but more broadly and regularly, the share of households with
370400	375600	access to drinking water has started to decline in recent years.
375600	380120	Water infrastructure is crumbling, and just recently, dozens have died on the outskirts
380120	385420	of Pretoria, the administrative capital, due to cholera—a disease virtually eliminated
385420	388840	from the modern world thanks to modern sanitation systems.
388840	393640	The nation's homicide rate is skyrocketing, climbing up towards its all-time high, and
393640	399340	the police and judiciary appear entirely ineffective at combating this as just 20% of murders end
399340	404440	up with anyone in court, and even then, just 31% of the public has trust in the courts
404440	407440	as the legal system breaks down as well.
407440	411920	South Africa's state-owned freight rail monopoly, Transnet, is too collapsing, in
411920	417160	a very similar situation to Eskom as it closes lines, struggles to keep locomotives running,
417160	423080	and carries 25% less cargo today than in 2015—a massive constraint for the country's
423080	426240	lucrative export-focused industrial sector.
426240	432080	South African Airways, which was separated from Transnet in 2006 but remained government-owned,
432080	437480	fully collapsed and ceased all operations in 2020 before restarting with new financing
437480	442160	as an embarrassing shell of its previously globe-spanning self.
442160	446680	No matter where one looks, one struggles to find any case where government service is
447200	452680	improving in South Africa, and the closer one looks, the more sense this starts to make.
452680	458800	When the blackouts began in 2007, they were little more than random, local, short-lasted,
458800	460560	inconvenient irregularities.
460560	466500	Then, in the January heat of the southern summer, they got a lot worse.
466500	471280	With demand surging past supply, tourists sat stranded in cable cars high above Cape
471280	476140	Town, mines evacuated miners from shafts that they could no longer ventilate or cool, and
476140	479860	the South African government declared a national emergency.
479860	484360	The panic power cuts made international news and tipped global markets as the price of
484360	489440	gold and platinum shot skyward after announcement that mines might not open for another six
489440	490580	weeks.
490580	494800	It was not the first load shedding that Eskom had mandated in recent months, but it was
494800	496500	by far the worst.
496500	498620	And it was right on time.
498620	503420	In fact, this very moment, when South Africa's mighty grid was catastrophically overstretched
503420	510000	by its consumers, had been predicted to nearly the exact year in this 1998 white paper.
510000	514740	As the paper had estimated, should no action be taken to expand power supply in South Africa,
514740	520980	the country's surplus, then sitting at a healthy 25% in 1997, would evaporate away
520980	523740	by about 2007.
523740	526260	And no action was taken.
526260	529900	For all that changed politically and socially with the end of apartheid and the rise of
529900	534740	the AMC, South Africa's grid on the supply side just didn't.
534740	539580	Of the nation's 15 separate power plants capable of producing more than 1,000 megawatts,
539580	545220	only these two came online during the period from 1990 to 2008, while these two were hastily
545220	550840	brought back into production having been mothballed decades prior when the country was power flush.
550840	555260	As heavy industry moved into the resource-rich country and progressive-minded policies extended
555260	559820	the grid to black and underprivileged neighborhoods post-apartheid, the margin between power and
559820	564720	needed and power available for shrank then disappeared entirely.
564720	570800	And why South Africa failed to take action is also explained by this white paper.
570800	577180	White papers, by their very nature, are supposed to be, if not concise, as concise as possible—outlining
577180	581480	specific problems, providing only the context deemed absolutely necessary, and offering
581480	583980	a set of specific options forward.
583980	586340	This one runs 110 pages.
587340	591820	And as for problems specifically facing the supply side, well, those aren't addressed
591820	596900	until 41 pages in, when the danger of a potential capacity shortage isn't touched on until
596900	602940	bullet point 8, behind issues of fair access to the grid, environmental concerns, and wasteful
602940	603940	usage.
603940	608760	And as for fixing the problems, there's this—a vague memorandum to expand access
608760	613800	and incentivize competition, recommendations both problematically broad and puzzling for
613800	618560	Eskom officials who had, to this point, maintained an understanding that as long as it provided
618560	623600	cheap electricity and lots of it, the state would keep its hands off.
623600	628040	The paper, like the government that authored it, meant well—it properly identified the
628040	632460	host of issues, but it pushed the longer-term problems to the back of the line and tried
632460	636380	to radically reform through vague and confusing mandates.
636380	641240	With the grid and beyond it, there was just too much to get to.
641240	645920	Some problems the whitepaper identified were addressed by the ANC, as grid access expanded
645920	650000	and pathways for black managers to work for the utility and black-owned businesses to
650000	654880	contract with the utility were created, but other problems were only made worse as the
654880	659560	ANC banned Eskom from building new plants to stimulate competition.
659560	664240	Ultimately, only when no competition appeared and the country began eating too far into
664240	667240	its margin did the ANC reverse the ban.
667240	671200	It was too little too late by then, as the nation that had been known for its energy
671200	676240	surplus, selling to nearby neighbors and producing megawatt-hour totals nearer to European averages
676240	681940	than those for its own continent, was now energy insecure by 2007, with experts saying
681940	687320	that they wouldn't be able to dig themselves out of the hole for another five years.
687320	692520	But more than 15 years on, as additional power plants have belatedly come online, the country's
692520	696760	still in the grips of regular rolling blackouts.
697280	701120	Across the 2010s, power capacity in South Africa steadily rose.
701120	707280	The problem was actual production still stagnated—it's one thing to build the plants, and another
707280	708780	to keep them running.
708780	714080	In late 2014 and early 2015, it was diesel shortages, drought, and plant maintenance
714080	717160	that cut national power production short of demand.
717160	723480	In 2019, it was a coal shortage, flooding, and alleged sabotage that led to worse blackouts.
723520	728320	Finally, beginning with maintenance issues in 2021, South Africa entered a spiral into
728320	730880	its worst outages ever.
730880	736280	Employee strikes in June of 2022, fires and failures in September of 2022, then more plant
736280	742120	failures in 2023 left some cities dark for entire days, while countrywide, blackouts
742120	748320	occurred at least once during 200 days of 2022—a new worst.
748320	752960	Delayed maintenance, old coal plants, and staff limitations were to blame.
752960	755760	But so too was institutional rot.
755760	762120	What was supposed to be fixed by ANC overhaul had fallen victim to the same ills plaguing
762120	764520	the ANC itself.
764520	770240	With cuts reaching 12 hours a day by the end of 2022, Eskom CEO Andre de Reuter privately
770240	775600	resigned—a move which nearly killed him when just hours after, someone slipped a potentially
775600	778600	lethal dose of cyanide into his coffee.
778600	783280	In a now-deleted interview revealing this close call, the former CEO went on to accuse
783280	788280	the ANC of institutional corruption, where Eskom served as the feeding trough, with an
788280	794080	estimated $1 billion rand or $52 million being stolen from the state utility every single
794080	795160	month.
795160	799720	While such a number is nearly impossible to verify, it would mark only the most direct
799720	804600	loss that such widespread and long-lasting blackouts are creating.
804600	809640	Inside GDP growth, which the ANC had once hoped to average 6% a year, has touched 4%
809640	815100	only once since power shortages began in 2007, while the South African Reserve Bank has estimated
815100	821860	that blackouts from 6 to 12 hours a day rip about 204 to 899 million rand out of the economy
821860	827240	a day—up to $50 million every single day.
827240	832080	Eskom, for its part, has raised electricity rates from the global basement, yet still
832080	837800	finds itself under a mountain of debt and unable to consistently keep the lights on.
837800	842360	Confronting this darkness, nearly everyone and everything that feasibly and financially
842360	846760	can are working to isolate themselves from the government—to build self-sufficiency
846760	850520	from the public services that they can no longer rely on.
850520	854880	To start, with police response times often stretching into hours, the wealthy rely on
854880	859940	the world's largest private security industry to keep them and their homes safe.
859940	864740	More people are employed by this industry, in fact, than the police and military combined.
864740	869880	That's because nearly every expensive home is plastered with a plaque indicating which
869880	874060	of the plethora of armed response security companies they're subscribed to, each of
874060	879020	which patrols the nice neighborhoods and shows up far faster than the police.
879020	883460	Outside of their homes, the life of the wealthy has largely receded from urban downtowns into
883460	888260	places like Santon and Johannesburg or Sea Point in Cape Town—both of which have organized
888260	892780	into city improvement districts where the local private sector groups together and pays
892780	898200	into an organization that ensures safety by hiring private security to patrol the streets.
898200	902820	And some go further—filling potholes, fixing streetlights, cleaning litter, doing all the
902820	906620	things that are the responsibility of the government on paper, but that don't happen
906620	909580	regularly or reliably in practice.
909580	913940	In sum, the proliferation of private security and city improvement districts allows wealthy
913940	918800	areas of the country to maintain a semblance of stability, offering pockets where the day-to-day
918800	922680	experience is no different to that of Europe, for example.
922680	926580	And this disconnect with their surroundings goes further for the wealthy few, as one of
926580	930420	the nation's booming industries is now solar installation.
930420	934340	South Africa's total solar capacity has more than doubled in just a year, as those
934340	938780	that can afford it are purchasing setups to allow for stable electricity regardless of
938780	939780	grid conditions.
940180	944660	And as perhaps the penultimate form before emigration, many wealthy residents are preparing
944660	949300	to eliminate their reliance on the South African state entirely by gaining the right to live
949300	950600	abroad.
950600	955460	Those that can obtain Australian or UK citizenship based on ancestry are exercising those rights
955460	959900	en masse, while immigration lawyers and nations are increasingly capitalizing on the fears
959900	961900	of those that can't.
961900	966620	Neighboring Namibia, for example, is developing a sprawling golf resort in Walvis Bay that
966620	971940	includes, with the purchase of a condo or home, a renewable work permit for the country.
971940	976580	Malta, St Kitts and Nevis, and others are straight up selling citizenship in exchange
976580	981260	for six-figure so-called investments in the countries, and plenty of South Africans with
981260	985300	the wealth to do so are taking them up on the offer in order to build out their Plan
985300	986300	Bs.
986300	991080	Now, it's not like South Africa hasn't been in a similar state before.
991080	995940	There was a time when crime was as high, there was a time when electricity access was worse,
995940	1000860	there was a time when, broadly, it was a less-developed nation than it is today.
1000860	1006100	But what makes its current reality so grim is that it's in a state of regression—it
1006100	1010740	is devolving from its previous state as one of the continent's most-developed economies.
1010740	1015240	And this devolution is morphing into a death spiral.
1015240	1016980	Look no further than the load shedding.
1016980	1021260	When the grid is turned off, the lack of dangerous electric currents makes it easy for thieves
1021260	1024060	to remove copper cables and transformers.
1024060	1028260	With each theft, the power utility has to divert resources towards fixing these new
1028260	1033500	issues rather than the generating issues that are causing the blackouts in the first place.
1033500	1037700	This makes the root cause worse, which makes blackouts more common, which makes theft more
1037700	1041300	common, which makes the root cause worse, and so on.
1041300	1045060	A certain degree of solution could come from the overarching government, rather than simply
1045060	1050240	within the power utility itself, but with each power cut, businesses lose money.
1050240	1053800	Production stops, food spoils, thieves steal.
1053800	1057060	The causes are myriad, but the effect is consistent.
1057060	1060640	Less income, which leads to a lower tax base for the government, which leaves it with less
1060640	1064480	money to bring back around to solve the root cause, which makes blackouts more common,
1064480	1068400	which makes the economic loss higher, which makes the root cause worse, and so on and
1068400	1069960	so on.
1069960	1075360	As all this occurs, quality of life declines for everyone in South Africa, even the wealthy
1075360	1076360	few.
1076360	1080080	They have to deal with higher crime, the inconvenience of load shedding, and a weakening economy
1080080	1084680	and Iran exchange rate, which makes purchasing foreign-made goods and services increasingly
1084680	1086000	out of reach.
1086000	1090760	With a luxury of choice, the rich are emigrating, bringing with them their wealth, knowledge,
1090760	1094440	and business, which weakens the economy, which makes the government less able to address
1094440	1098720	the root cause, which makes blackouts more common, which makes more emigrate, which weakens
1098720	1101880	the economy, which makes the government less able to address the root cause, which makes
1101880	1106280	the root cause worse, and so on and so on and so on.
1106280	1110380	This death spiral extends society-wide.
1110380	1115960	It is now a central, unique defining feature of the South African state.
1115960	1120980	As the continent's poverty rate plummets, South Africa's is rising.
1120980	1125800	As the continent's human development rates go up, South Africa's declines.
1125800	1130500	As almost every indicator of human and economic progress improves on the continent, South
1130500	1132000	Africa's regresses.
1132520	1137160	That's to say, this isn't some systematic issue, there isn't some force of nature
1137160	1143680	making the nation's decline inevitable, which leaves just one other possible culprit—the
1143680	1145480	government.
1145480	1149200	Support for the African National Congress, once synonymous with the support for the end
1149200	1152560	of apartheid, has reached an all-time low.
1152560	1157080	2021 was the first municipal election that saw their share of the national vote drop
1157080	1158760	below 50%.
1158760	1163440	Only every issue has only escalated since then, and new stories of corruption and cronyism
1163440	1166040	within the party emerge every day.
1166040	1172600	In 2024, the nation will elect a new National Assembly, and, with declining support and
1172600	1178320	a growing coalition in opposition, the ANC is on its most tenuous footing ever, and the
1178320	1184360	country could see functional political plurality for the first time in the post-apartheid era.
1184360	1189860	Now, as rhetoric focuses on whether South Africa will slide into failed state status,
1189860	1194680	there is a question worth asking on whether the nation has ever actually been a functional
1194680	1196020	state.
1196020	1200160	There was a time when it seemed more stable and prosperous than today, but that was only
1200160	1205260	the part of the nation that one saw on World Cup broadcasts, the part lived in by South
1205260	1210600	Africans one would meet abroad, more specifically, it was the white nation, while the black nation's
1210600	1212640	voices were stifled.
1212640	1216720	During the apartheid era, South Africa failed to provide basic services of an acceptable
1216720	1222640	standard—sanitation, education, police—to the majority of its population, the black
1222640	1224000	population.
1224000	1227360	By many definitions, that is a failed state.
1227360	1232820	So that's to say, basic services have never been at an acceptable level.
1232820	1237260	The difference is that today, the deficiency is being shared more equally.
1237260	1241240	It would have been unrealistic to expect that a standard of living experienced by a privileged
1241240	1246340	minority propped up by oppression itself could immediately extend to all—it was always
1246340	1248520	going to be a tricky transition.
1248520	1254400	But tragically, the ANC, the institution most responsible for inciting this transition,
1254400	1256900	is now slowing it down.
1256900	1261180	Party members are using their positions to steal from the state, to use oppression to
1261180	1266680	prop up the privileged—the very dynamic they fought to end.
1266680	1270760	Perhaps the sole light in the situation is the fact that it has worsened enough that
1270760	1275800	one can identify that the transition is failing—that a new approach is needed.
1275800	1279860	South Africa still has a starting point that would be the envy of most of its continental
1279860	1280860	neighbors.
1280860	1284880	It still has a robust economy, a relatively high standard of living, and is naturally
1284880	1289580	indebted with valuable resources, so it's not too late to capitalize on its situation
1289580	1294900	and create a thriving state that truly works for all, but the window of opportunity is
1294900	1297900	slowly starting to close.
1297900	1302580	With each passing day, those with the luxury of choice are giving up—they're packing
1302580	1307480	their bags and driving to the airport one last time.
1307480	1313940	With each hour of load shedding, the economy shrinks further, and the death spiral accelerates.
1313940	1319740	Hope is not lost in South Africa, but with each day that passes, the path towards prosperity
1319740	1323820	grows ever harder to find.
1323820	1324820	Finance is tricky.
1324820	1328400	It's a very easy thing to lose track of, especially as companies increasingly design
1328400	1331620	their services around you for getting your spending money.
1331620	1335860	Subscriptions especially can really add up, but to help me manage my monthly spending,
1335860	1338980	I recently started using our sponsor, Rocket Money.
1338980	1343540	They're an all-in-one finance platform that helps you save more and spend less.
1343540	1347980	Personally, I find it super useful as a save for a down payment on a house, as I can build
1347980	1352380	my custom budget that automatically monitors my spending by category, plus monitor my credit
1352380	1356220	score to make sure I raise it as much as possible to get a good interest rate, and
1356220	1359940	it even allows me to automatically deposit a certain amount of money into a smart savings
1359940	1362540	account to grow my savings even more.
1362540	1367500	Personally, I really like having Rocket Money as my all-in-one solution to money management,
1367500	1370940	rather than having to use a bunch of different apps that don't really work together, and
1370940	1375440	if you happen to be one of those very common people who want to save more and spend less,
1375440	1379620	you can go to rocketmoney.com slash wendover or click the link in the description to get
1379620	1383300	started for free, and then you can unlock even more features with Premium.
