0	4180	This is a town—legally, at least.
4180	7160	So is this and this and this.
7160	11860	Each displays the characteristics of an idyllic small-town community, but largely in the same
11860	17540	way Main Street Disney displays the characteristics of an idyllic small-town community.
17540	22580	These were towns—they were vibrant communities filled with average Americans living their
22580	25700	mountain dreams—but they've been gutted.
26320	31140	They've had their cores ripped out by economic forces from afar, leaving only a shell propped
31140	36300	up by the resilient few willing to fight to keep the dream alive.
36300	39680	North American ski towns are peppered across remote corners of the continent's least
39680	43740	populous regions, yet for four months in the winter and three in the summer, they become
43740	48360	bustling destinations with jets, both public and private, shuttling in thousands of visitors
48360	52900	from California, Texas, Florida, and beyond daily, each on a brief reprieve from urban
52900	55940	life to soak in the crisp, light mountain air.
55940	60860	For the five other months of the year, though, these verge on ghost towns.
60860	65620	In Breckenridge, for example, just 20% of housing units are occupied by full-time residents,
65620	69780	meaning in those five months of off-season, neighbors aren't next door—they're on
69780	71560	the next block.
71560	76220	With the infrastructure to support more than five times the population, streets simply
76220	77940	sit empty.
77980	83580	On the other side of the Swatch Range, in Crested Butte, only 14 of 43 restaurants kept
83580	88260	open through the last spring off-season, and even of those, many kept drastically reduced
88260	91700	hours and limited menus for the limited, local covers.
91700	96620	And across the Elk Mountain Range, in Aspen, even the airport closes for its theoretically
96620	101680	irregular but in practice annual two-week runway maintenance procedure.
101680	106540	One could assume that this soullessness is the inevitable byproduct of life in a remote
106540	110700	tourism-based economy, but history hardly supports this view.
110700	114660	While today it appears that there's some sort of fundamental incompatibility between
114660	119220	ski resorts and ski towns, the very fact that they're called ski towns demonstrates that
119220	124200	there was once a time when it was all possible—there was a time when a remote mountain town could
124200	126380	just have a ski area.
126380	131100	In the early days, the resorts were not what gutted the communities, but rather what kept
131100	133280	them alive.
133280	137420	Before the rugged rural reaches of North America, blessed with consistent snowfall and north-facing
137420	140880	slopes for ski towns, they were boomtowns gone bust.
140880	146120	Aspen, Telluride, Crested Butte, Breckenridge, Park City—all mining towns whose best days
146120	147280	were behind them.
147280	151680	Or, they were rugged resource towns run on logging like Truckee and Revelstoke.
151680	156560	Or, like Vail and Snowmass Village, they weren't towns at all, just ranch land and old mining
156560	157640	claims.
157640	161440	But one by one, they all blossomed into ski towns.
161440	165560	And whether it was Austrian expats helping lay rope-toes in the 30s and 40s, 10th Mountain
165560	170120	Division veterans drawing up plans in the 50s and 60s, or developers and local boosters
170120	174600	dreaming up lift lines and base villages in the decades since, skiing offered a lifeline
174600	177720	to communities on the verge of collapse.
177720	180940	From the start, the ski business was pretty simple.
180940	184800	Offer lift services, groom managed terrain and on-mountain restaurants, like a theme
184800	189120	park would, and charge a daily fee for the services, like a theme park would.
189120	192760	Employ the established locals to build new hotels and housing to keep up with increasing
192760	193760	traffic.
193760	198680	Employ eager new arrivals hoping to become locals in the ski school and ticket offices.
198680	202760	Offer a season pass for locals and serious skiers to keep some cash on hand in fall and
202760	203920	early winter.
203920	207320	Pray for snow to draw in the day pass crowds, then reinvest those earnings in the summer
207320	210980	into fancier lodges and amenities to get the higher dollar customers who didn't drive
210980	214800	up from the nearest town, but flew in from the nearest city.
214800	216600	The model wasn't unique.
216600	220840	When the chances presented, all industries looked to corner the highest-yield customers.
220840	224960	It wasn't complicated either—Hope Mother Nature provided the goods and built out all
224960	229320	the infrastructure, from housing and hotels to tramlines and terrain parks, to maximize
229320	230600	earnings when she did.
230600	233080	And it certainly wasn't flexible.
233080	237220	The more terrain the resort added, or the more snowmaking it required, the more it charged
237220	238680	for a day pass.
238680	242800	Competing for attention from the world's wealthiest, ski resorts added and built and
242800	244120	added and built.
244120	247160	The race to the top reinvigorated ski towns.
247160	254240	Then, as land and housing ran low and popularity reached its zenith, it began to squeeze them.
254240	258280	Regardless of the strain between ski company and ski town, this business model worked through
258280	262320	the 2000s until suddenly it didn't.
262320	267280	The issue wasn't existential yet, but the trends and forecasts indicated that it could
267280	269240	soon become so.
269240	273040	Skier numbers reached their high point in the late aughts and early 2010s, and then
273040	274040	they plateaued.
274040	280080	2007 through 2010 were good years, some of the best in fact in terms of total ski days,
280080	282560	but then the numbers fell.
282560	286960	A similar pattern emerged in the number of individual skiers participating in the sport.
286960	292480	From 2008 to 2016, the number of unique skiers in the US, or individuals that participated
292480	297680	in the sport that year, topped out at 10 million, and then began to drop.
297680	300680	Warm, dry weather was partly to blame.
301080	304000	But weather alone wasn't a worthy excuse.
304000	309160	Low snow and shorter winters were, after all, going to be a factor going forward anyway.
309160	313840	Rather, the sport was just too expensive.
313840	319040	Day passes were reaching $200, season passes well over $1,000.
319040	323320	Making things worse, the people who had grown up on resort skiing were aging.
323320	328520	The industry's race to the top made the sport entirely too expensive and too old.
328520	334400	Then, Vail Resorts came and entirely reimagined the industry.
334400	336600	Vail is a town.
336600	340920	A manufactured Alps-like village bisected by Interstate 70 about an hour and a half
340920	346680	long drive from Denver, Vail Ski Resort, understandably, towers over the town of Vail.
346680	352480	But nowhere in this resort or this town will you find the offices of Vail Resorts, or MTN
352480	354440	as it's labeled on the New York Stock Exchange.
354440	357360	They're just not here.
357360	362560	This is a sign of something bigger—that Vail Resorts the company has effectively decoupled
362560	368920	itself from the physical ski resort, and in doing so, has transformed the industry.
368920	374000	Since the early 2000s, Vail Resorts has owned and managed Vail, Beaver Creek, and Keystone
374000	377120	in Colorado, along with Heavenly in California.
377120	382280	This wasn't necessarily unique—KSL Capital, Powder, Molson Silver International, and even
382280	386940	Sinclair Oil had all collected an arrangement of North American ski resorts.
387520	391280	What Vail Resorts did that made it unique was that, as ski numbers began to stagnate,
391280	393140	it went on a spending spree.
393140	396580	In 2012, the conglomerate bought three smaller resorts.
396580	399760	In 2013, it bought the prestigious Canyons Resort in Utah.
399760	402100	The following year, it bought Park City.
402100	404940	Then it went international, purchasing an Australian resort.
404940	410980	From 2016 to 2018, Vail went even bigger, taking over iconic resorts in Whistler-Blackcomb,
410980	412700	Stowe, and Crested Butte.
412700	417780	In 2019, it bought Peak Resorts, which owned 17 areas across the Midwest and Northeast.
417780	422940	In the face of worrying winters and aging skiers, Vail began scooping up resorts—some
422940	428260	of them tiny, some of them world-class, but all of them now available on a single-season
428260	429620	pass.
429620	434580	To little fanfare, Vail launched the Epic Pass in 2008, offering its buyers unlimited
434580	438380	skiing at any of the five Vail-run resorts.
438380	442320	And oddly, for a pass that boasted some of the best skiing in the Rockies, the price
442320	448240	was low—very low—only $579 for an unlimited pass.
448240	456360	For comparison, an Aspen pass that same season, at its very cheapest, was $1,769—more than
456360	457360	triple.
457360	462200	Odder still, in the years that followed, as Vail bought up resorts and entered deals that
462200	467100	gave Epic Pass holders access to top resorts like Telluride and Arapahoe Basin, the pass
467100	471620	stayed cheap, at least for the industry, crossing the $800 plateau for the first time
471620	479060	in 2015, and still managing to stay under the $1,000 mark all the way through 2024.
479060	483940	The Epic Pass was and is, in the world of skiing, a cheap-season pass, but it was not
483940	487620	a cheap product—it was an entirely new product.
487620	492380	It wasn't meant for the hardened, ski-obsessed locals that hit the hill 100 days a season—it
492380	497020	was for a market that had previously been served by day passes, multi-day punch passes,
497020	502060	and those that had been priced out entirely—the 10-to-20-day-a-year skier of varying age,
502060	504020	economic standing, and location.
504020	509220	Now, the thinking went, a well-to-do businessperson in New York or Chicago or Boston could buy
509220	514100	an Epic Pass and ski their nearby local hills every other Saturday and justify the purchase.
514100	519240	If they wanted to ski in Colorado or Utah or British Columbia over a family vacation,
519240	520460	they just had to get there.
520460	523580	The skiing, at that point, would essentially be free.
523580	527060	The penniless college kid who grew up skiing with their parents could ask for an Epic Pass
527060	528060	for Christmas.
528060	531380	They'd fulfill their obligations to ski with family over Christmas, then could load
531380	535700	up with friends in Road Trip Rockies resorts staying in Airbnbs and avoiding prohibitively
535700	537480	expensive lift tickets.
537480	541740	The young professional living in Denver, Salt Lake City, Seattle, San Francisco, Boston,
541740	546480	or even LA and New York could buy the pass and split the expense of day-long or weekend-long
546480	549660	trips to the mountains with a host of like-minded friends.
549660	554460	And, if they executed it right, what they'd lose in margins they'd make up in volume,
554460	558840	creating a new and loyal customer base that didn't sit on the sidelines priced out and
558840	560500	didn't pay for day passes.
560500	565940	As this graph of total Epic Pass product purchases suggests, they executed it right.
565940	570100	And as this 2023 Investors Conference report from the company boasts, they've gotten
570100	574940	really good at getting customers to buy passes over lift tickets.
574940	577860	The impact was bigger than Vail Resorts.
577860	582100	With Vail's Epic Pass, and the emergence and maturation of a competitor, Alterra, and
582100	587100	its Icon Pass boasting a similarly impressive list of mountains under its cheap Megapass,
587100	593060	skiing was suddenly reinvigorated as 2018-19 visitor totals finally broke the near decade-long
593060	594780	trend of flattening numbers.
594780	600460	By the following season, the Megapass' takeover was complete—for the first time on record,
600460	606540	the share of ski days logged on season passes outnumbered those on day and multi-day tickets.
606540	611100	Through consolidation under two major umbrella brands, skiing got a shot in the arm.
611100	615800	It became younger, slightly more accessible, and far more flexible.
615800	620300	And under the two brands, the ski industry reinvented itself.
620300	625620	Alterra and Vail had stable, predictable income stemming from non-weather-dependent pass sales,
625620	629580	they had dependable cash flows to take on capital projects in the off-season, and they
629580	630740	had bad weather insurance.
630740	635060	If it didn't snow in one region, their losses would likely be cancelled out by a good snow
635060	637400	year somewhere else.
637400	640980	Without being tied to a single mountain, Vail could turn its focus to real estate development
640980	645220	at the base of Vail Mountain, or marketing strategies for when it just wouldn't snow,
645220	646580	or building out the Epic brand.
646580	652600	In the process, as it sought to maximize profits for its shareholders, the company became omnipresent
652600	655580	in the areas in which it operates.
655580	661660	Vail the resort is here, nestled in a tight valley sitting at the base of some of Colorado's
661660	662660	tallest peaks.
662980	668060	The nearest airport, given its need for flat land, is 35 minutes away here, although many
668060	672700	visitors choose to fly into here, the far larger Denver International Airport.
672700	676840	Either way, Vail Resorts has made sure it's convenient to actually get to Vail itself
676840	681820	with its Epic Mountain Express, offering $99 shared shuttles for the two-hour trip from
681820	686060	Denver or $49 ones for the quicker drive from Eagle County Airport.
686060	691780	For those that would balk at the prospect of sharing a shuttle, they also offer $319
691780	695460	private SUVs on the same 35-minute drive.
695460	700140	In all cases, as long as it's Epic Mountain Express, Epic Passholders, of course, get
700140	703020	rewarded with 20% off.
703020	707220	But on the other end of the shuttle, visitors need accommodation, and Vail, of course, has
707220	708220	that handle too.
708220	712700	There are Vail-owned hotels, like the Lodge at Vail, there are other hotels bookable through
712700	717380	Vail, or there are independently-owned apartment and house rentals, managed by Vail-owned Legendary
717380	718380	Lodging.
718380	722860	In all cases, Epic Passholders get a discount once again.
722860	727100	But to ski one needs skis, so next up on day one is the rental shop.
727100	733220	Vail has that handled at Vail Sports, which, once again, offers discounts for Epic Passholders.
733220	737580	Visitors also need jackets and pants and goggles and all sorts of non-rentable gear, so they
737580	742060	could head to outposts of recognizable brands like Helly Hansen or Patagonia or the North
742060	743060	Face.
743060	747420	Yet, despite their branding, visitors are once again feeding money to the conglomerate
747460	753740	as these two are Vail-owned and operated franchise stores, part of more than 250 Vail-owned retail
753740	755900	stores around the world.
755900	759740	After that is dinner, which, too, can be accomplished without giving a dollar to anyone but Vail
759740	764060	at restaurants like Margie's House, then drinks at 10th Mountain at the Hythe Hotel.
764060	767980	While skiing the next day, the trend can continue with dining at one of the dozens of Vail-run
767980	771340	on-mountain restaurants, again with a discount for Passholders.
771340	775160	Then, if the day ends and a visitor loves the lifestyle so much that they want to make
775160	778800	it more regular, they could tour property listings with an agent from Sliffer, Smith,
778800	783800	and Frampton—the largest real estate broker in the Vail Valley, which, also, is owned
783800	785840	by Vail Resorts.
785840	790240	While the most extreme example, the reality isn't far off from this.
790240	794440	Facing natural pressures from shareholders to grow revenue, Vail is increasingly focused
794440	797540	on vertically integrating the visitor experience.
797540	800680	Why should a Vail visitor give money to anyone but Vail itself?
800680	805080	They're developing offerings for almost any transaction a visitor could make, then
805080	809860	incentivizing allegiance to the Epic system by offering a slew of discounts.
809860	814680	In the process, Vail is competing against local businesses—they're eliminating one
814680	819280	of the few opportunities for local success to be tied to their success.
819280	825880	What's left is the financial impossibility of minimum wage work in the Vail Valley.
825880	830520	There are no easy answers to where a Vail employee might start their day.
830520	835040	The conglomerate's new minimum wage is $20 an hour, a near fortune compared to minimum
835040	839360	wage at most entry-level jobs in America, but most entry-level jobs aren't located
839360	844400	here, in a narrow mountain valley bounded by two often impassable sections of highway
844400	847920	boasting some of the highest living costs in the world.
847920	853320	Currently, the cheapest publicly listed apartment for rent within Vail city limits is going
853320	856520	for $2,500 a month.
856520	860280	Assuming 40 hours per week of work, which might come if the slopes are busy and the
860280	865120	snow is abundant, a given lift operator might make $3,200 a month.
865120	870060	Therefore, after tax, they might make ever so slightly more than what it costs to keep
870060	872640	an apartment in the town in which they work.
872640	877080	But of course, in a small-town environment like this, and considering the competitiveness
877080	881240	of housing, most rentals never make it beyond the classifieds.
881240	886880	Here one can find deals like this $1,150 a month room in an apartment in Edwards, a
886880	893280	20 minute drive away, assuming one pays for the $425 a year Vail employee parking pass.
893280	899160	This gets closer to the 28% of income financial experts recommend spending on housing.
899160	903760	To get under that 28%, it's going to require an apartment with roommates somewhere like
903760	908960	Eagle or Gypsum, more than 30 miles or 50 kilometers from Vail.
909040	914040	Vail Resorts understands this financial impossibility, and their fix is to act as both the employer
914040	918120	and the landlord with their employee housing program, offering hundreds of rooms near the
918120	921540	resort for $500 or $600 a month.
921540	926400	These tiny dorm-style accommodations are in tremendous demand, often filling up months
926400	930760	before the start of the season, but never accommodating all workers, leaving hundreds
930760	934840	to work through the financial impossibility of the free market.
934840	938440	The truth is, these jobs don't need to be sustainable.
938440	943020	Vail doesn't need to offer a living wage to fill its rosters.
943020	947120	The pure prospect of being able to live in the mountains is attractive enough to incentivize
947120	951760	plenty of financially flexible young people into working a season or two on the slopes,
951760	954480	even if they might not make more than they spend.
954480	956160	Vail knows this.
956160	959320	Vail's mission statement even implies this.
959320	963280	It reads, quote, our mission is simple, to create the experience of a lifetime for our
963280	968660	employees, so they can, in turn, provide exceptional experiences for our guests.
968660	973840	Creating a job so rewarding people are willing to effectively pay to do it is no crime, but
973840	978620	what it does mean is that Vail's money doesn't stay in the Vail Valley.
978620	983320	It primarily goes to a transient, short-term labor pool that'll be gone come spring,
983320	986860	never integrating with the long-term local community.
986860	991520	Of course, there are some resort jobs that require more specialized skills and pay more,
991520	992720	but not many.
992720	997040	Ski Patrol, for example, is a dangerous job that requires skills that take years to learn,
997040	1001680	so it's a role typically filled by careerists rather than transient seasonal workers, but
1001680	1008000	in Vail's case, that only justifies a $21 minimum wage—a menial bump over the resort-wide
1008000	1010000	$20 minimum.
1010000	1011880	But Vail's a big business, right?
1011880	1015600	It's a publicly traded company on the New York Stock Exchange.
1015600	1019720	Surely it must have HR and marketing and vice presidents and executives and all the higher-paying
1019720	1023120	jobs that make for more sustainable urban economies, right?
1023120	1027560	Well, yes, Vail does have that, just not in Vail.
1027560	1032480	In 2006, the conglomerate moved about 100 of its administrative positions two hours
1032480	1035800	down the road to an office park outside Denver.
1035800	1040120	Because of the living costs that Vail itself pushed up, it was simply cheaper for Vail
1040120	1043380	to run Vail away from Vail.
1043380	1047580	Through time, with each resort it gobbled up, it slowly cut local management positions
1047580	1052140	and aggregated administrative tasks in this Denver headquarters, meaning the resorts themselves
1052140	1058060	were left with few jobs outside mountain operations, hospitality, and retail—the lowest paying,
1058060	1059900	least sustainable positions.
1059900	1064880	Therefore, in sum, what happens when Vail buys a resort is simple—income potential
1064880	1069920	lowers as jobs get slashed and cost-of-living rockets skyward as the volume of visitors
1069920	1072180	and therefore demand does too.
1072440	1078440	Now, Vail itself, the resort from which the conglomerate was born, was never truly a town.
1078440	1082960	It was a development from day one, so, at least within city limits, the argument can
1082960	1088000	be made that nobody's been displaced—there's no history of habitation before the lifts
1088000	1089000	started spinning.
1089000	1091720	But this is not the case everywhere.
1091720	1097520	60 miles or 100 kilometers away, in the tiny, idyllic town of Crested Butte, the Facebook
1097520	1102620	comments on the 2018 announcement of Vail's purchase of the local resort read like those
1102620	1104240	of an obituary.
1104240	1108620	This was a ski resort that ran a marketing campaign titled This Is Not Vail and a locale
1108620	1113820	referred to as the Last Great Colorado Ski Town, noted for its increasingly unique blend
1113820	1117020	of affordability, remoteness, and skiing prowess.
1117020	1122340	Now, this tenuous balance was going to get disrupted by the world's largest skiing
1122340	1127340	conglomerate, and it was absolutely disrupted.
1127340	1130880	Whereas in the month of Vail's announcement, the average sales price of a single-family
1130880	1137600	home in Crested Butte sat at $762,000, today, less than five years on, it skyrocketed to
1137600	1140220	over 1.2 million.
1140220	1144400	The same, all-too-predictable story played out once again.
1144400	1149260	Big tracts of open land were split up, sold off, and converted into five, ten, or fifteen
1149260	1150880	million dollar ranches.
1150880	1155000	Downtown houses previously home to locals working just blocks away were bought up, renovated,
1155000	1159180	and sold as second homes and investment properties to those earning an income in Dallas, Miami,
1159180	1160180	or New York.
1160180	1163740	The workforce that kept the town ticking was pushed farther and farther down valley, and
1163740	1168400	the small city of Gunnison increasingly became the bedroom of decades-long Crested Butte
1168400	1169400	locals.
1169400	1174580	There was a brief moment of homeostasis in the North American ski industry, an era when
1174580	1180700	it could all coexist, but in today's reality, skiing is simply extractive.
1180700	1184980	Coastal money comes in and, despite good intentions, it pushes up the cost of living, it crowds
1184980	1189320	out the locals, and then ultimately, that money doesn't go to the locals it's displacing,
1189320	1191960	it goes to the shareholders of a conglomerate.
1191960	1197320	But this phenomenon is familiar to these towns, given their histories in mining, logging,
1197320	1199600	and other resource-based economies.
1199600	1204460	The way their populations could make a living all centered around quite literally extracting
1204460	1206800	value from the surrounding nature.
1206800	1211780	The story of a struggle between small communities and big mining conglomerates is a tale so
1211780	1214760	archetypical that it hardly bears repeating.
1214760	1218340	In fact, the similarities between Crested Butte's history and the plot of the movie
1218340	1224780	Avatar are so striking that many have pondered if the film was directly inspired by the town.
1224780	1229300	Skiing was supposed to be the way out, the path forward, a way to have it all, in-come-to-live
1229300	1234340	in America's most striking nature, coming from an industry far less destructive to that
1234340	1235340	nature.
1235340	1241500	But the long-run consequences of this turned out to be the destruction of the towns themselves.
1241500	1245360	It appears a devil's bargain—you can have the nature and the town, but not the
1245360	1246820	in-come-to-live there.
1246820	1250200	You can have the town and the in-come, but not the nature to enjoy.
1250200	1254760	Or, as so many of the most pristine slices of the mountains have chosen, you can have
1254760	1259100	the nature and the in-come, but you cede the town.
1259100	1264520	Unnatural forces can flex this triangle, can allow for a careful, tenuous balance of the
1264520	1269720	three factors, but it's tremendously difficult to maintain through the decades.
1269740	1274740	Therefore, Vale and other conglomerates didn't create this devil's bargain, but rather
1274740	1278540	their influences made the decisions for the communities.
1278540	1283260	Small, delicate towns were forced into option number three.
1283260	1288540	They'd have jobs, more than they could possibly need or even want, and they'd have nature,
1288540	1292060	even if it'd be stressed to its limits by an influx of past holding visitors, but they'd
1292060	1295620	no longer have affordable access to their own town.
1295620	1299220	It's a tricky thing, housing affordability.
1299220	1303320	Even the largest cities, states, and even countries have repeatedly failed to stop the
1303320	1308180	savage economic forces that break the careful balance of income and cost, so the issue is
1308180	1311000	certainly not unique to ski towns.
1311000	1316200	The primary difference is that they're phenomenally more vulnerable to outside forces.
1316200	1321580	These towns are truly tiny—Aspen, Telluride, and Breckenridge combined have a full-time
1321580	1327400	population smaller than innumerable American towns whose names you'll never even hear,
1327400	1328680	let alone know.
1328940	1334360	Therefore, one small outside action, one boardroom decision to sign on the dotted line and sail
1334360	1339360	to the highest bidder, has the potential to fundamentally alter and fracture an entire
1339360	1340360	community.
1340360	1344620	But this might just be the tragic trade-off of small-town life.
1344620	1349580	It's the story of the local factory getting automated, the story of the mine closing up
1349580	1355280	shop, the new interstate shortcutting the old highway, the railroad stopping service.
1355280	1359960	Both places are vulnerable, and while this doesn't necessarily need to be the conclusion
1359960	1365220	of life in these mountain communities, it does seem an inevitable step in their perpetual
1365220	1366220	evolution.
1366220	1371280	If there's one thing the uninitiated might have noticed in this video, it's that skiing
1371280	1374200	is unbelievably expensive.
1374200	1378560	Why does it cost each visitor one or two thousand dollars to get access to land that is actually
1378560	1381920	government-owned, covered in snow, that falls naturally?
1382240	1386960	Well, the truth is that making those slopes actually safely ski-able, and more so enjoyable
1386960	1391280	for thousands or even millions of people, is a tremendous amount of work.
1391280	1395920	There are an unbelievable number of daily, monthly, and yearly steps involved just to
1395920	1400480	allow for those seven or eight hours a day of skiing, and we wanted to dive deeper into
1400480	1403800	them—far deeper than we could in this already long video.
1403800	1409600	That's why I'm extremely excited to announce our brand new Nebula original series called
1409600	1412040	the Logistics of X.
1412040	1415600	Every few Wendover videos, if there's some sort of underlying logistics to their topic
1415600	1419160	worth exploring, we're going to dive deeper into it on Nebula.
1419160	1423400	And these are not low-effort companion videos—we produce these the exact same way we produce
1423400	1428120	Wendover videos, with the exact same budget, effort, everything, so they're just as good,
1428120	1429120	if not better.
1429120	1432840	And the first one, the Logistics of Ski Resorts, is up now.
1432840	1436780	I think it came together really nicely, with stunning 3D visuals and some really interesting
1436780	1440520	deep dives into things like the mad rush to install a lift in the few summer months
1440520	1444320	when the ground is snow-free, how you manage the snow to prevent a deadly avalanche, and
1444320	1447980	also the incredible overnight process of grooming the slopes to make them accessible to beginner
1447980	1448980	skiers.
1448980	1453040	Basically, we know you all love our logistics videos and we want to make even more of them,
1453040	1456380	getting even more into the nitty-gritty, and this series is the way.
1456380	1459740	And the reason we're able to do this is thanks to Nebula—for those of you who don't
1459740	1464100	know, Nebula is a creator-run streaming service that I co-founded in 2019 that now has over
1464100	1466460	650,000 paying subscribers.
1466460	1470300	And these are not subscriptions that people forgot to cancel—we have one of the highest
1470300	1474660	proportions of daily active users in the industry because creators are able to use the unique
1474660	1477820	economic model to do stuff they can't on YouTube.
1477820	1481740	Some channels, like Jetlag the Game release episodes early, others, like RealLifeLaura
1481740	1485140	and NowWendover, make series allowing you to dive deeper on the topics you watch on
1485140	1489920	YouTube, others still, like Patrick Willems or Abigail Thorne, make huge, ambitious dream
1489920	1494060	projects with the bigger budgets that Nebula is able to offer, but in addition to all of
1494060	1498260	that, all creators release their normal videos ad- and sponsorship-free.
1498260	1502860	Nebula is not really designed to be a replacement to YouTube, but rather an expansion pack.
1502860	1506880	There are limitations of the algorithmic-driven, ad-supported video model, so Nebula is able
1506880	1511180	to offer a creative ecosystem that unlocks more and therefore is a better experience
1511180	1513620	for the creator and you, the viewer.
1513620	1518120	When you sign up at our link, nebula.tv slash wendover, we actually get a portion of your
1518120	1522620	subscription fee for as long as you stay subscribed, which gives us predictable, stable monthly
1522620	1527180	income, not impacted by the shift in ad rates, that allows us to confidently reinvest in
1527180	1528180	the channel.
1528180	1531460	Tens of thousands of Wendover viewers have already signed up, and the vast majority are
1531460	1534580	still subscribed so clearly they find it worth it.
1534580	1538380	So if you want to watch the logistics of ski resorts, the future episodes we add to that
1538380	1541820	series, and everything else Nebula has to offer, click the button on screen or head
1541820	1547060	to nebula.tv slash wendover to sign up, where you'll even get $20 off an annual subscription,
1547060	1549820	and genuinely, thank you so much for your support.
