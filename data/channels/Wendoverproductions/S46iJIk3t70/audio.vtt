00:00.000 --> 00:04.180
This is a town—legally, at least.

00:04.180 --> 00:07.160
So is this and this and this.

00:07.160 --> 00:11.860
Each displays the characteristics of an idyllic small-town community, but largely in the same

00:11.860 --> 00:17.540
way Main Street Disney displays the characteristics of an idyllic small-town community.

00:17.540 --> 00:22.580
These were towns—they were vibrant communities filled with average Americans living their

00:22.580 --> 00:25.700
mountain dreams—but they've been gutted.

00:26.320 --> 00:31.140
They've had their cores ripped out by economic forces from afar, leaving only a shell propped

00:31.140 --> 00:36.300
up by the resilient few willing to fight to keep the dream alive.

00:36.300 --> 00:39.680
North American ski towns are peppered across remote corners of the continent's least

00:39.680 --> 00:43.740
populous regions, yet for four months in the winter and three in the summer, they become

00:43.740 --> 00:48.360
bustling destinations with jets, both public and private, shuttling in thousands of visitors

00:48.360 --> 00:52.900
from California, Texas, Florida, and beyond daily, each on a brief reprieve from urban

00:52.900 --> 00:55.940
life to soak in the crisp, light mountain air.

00:55.940 --> 01:00.860
For the five other months of the year, though, these verge on ghost towns.

01:00.860 --> 01:05.620
In Breckenridge, for example, just 20% of housing units are occupied by full-time residents,

01:05.620 --> 01:09.780
meaning in those five months of off-season, neighbors aren't next door—they're on

01:09.780 --> 01:11.560
the next block.

01:11.560 --> 01:16.220
With the infrastructure to support more than five times the population, streets simply

01:16.220 --> 01:17.940
sit empty.

01:17.980 --> 01:23.580
On the other side of the Swatch Range, in Crested Butte, only 14 of 43 restaurants kept

01:23.580 --> 01:28.260
open through the last spring off-season, and even of those, many kept drastically reduced

01:28.260 --> 01:31.700
hours and limited menus for the limited, local covers.

01:31.700 --> 01:36.620
And across the Elk Mountain Range, in Aspen, even the airport closes for its theoretically

01:36.620 --> 01:41.680
irregular but in practice annual two-week runway maintenance procedure.

01:41.680 --> 01:46.540
One could assume that this soullessness is the inevitable byproduct of life in a remote

01:46.540 --> 01:50.700
tourism-based economy, but history hardly supports this view.

01:50.700 --> 01:54.660
While today it appears that there's some sort of fundamental incompatibility between

01:54.660 --> 01:59.220
ski resorts and ski towns, the very fact that they're called ski towns demonstrates that

01:59.220 --> 02:04.200
there was once a time when it was all possible—there was a time when a remote mountain town could

02:04.200 --> 02:06.380
just have a ski area.

02:06.380 --> 02:11.100
In the early days, the resorts were not what gutted the communities, but rather what kept

02:11.100 --> 02:13.280
them alive.

02:13.280 --> 02:17.420
Before the rugged rural reaches of North America, blessed with consistent snowfall and north-facing

02:17.420 --> 02:20.880
slopes for ski towns, they were boomtowns gone bust.

02:20.880 --> 02:26.120
Aspen, Telluride, Crested Butte, Breckenridge, Park City—all mining towns whose best days

02:26.120 --> 02:27.280
were behind them.

02:27.280 --> 02:31.680
Or, they were rugged resource towns run on logging like Truckee and Revelstoke.

02:31.680 --> 02:36.560
Or, like Vail and Snowmass Village, they weren't towns at all, just ranch land and old mining

02:36.560 --> 02:37.640
claims.

02:37.640 --> 02:41.440
But one by one, they all blossomed into ski towns.

02:41.440 --> 02:45.560
And whether it was Austrian expats helping lay rope-toes in the 30s and 40s, 10th Mountain

02:45.560 --> 02:50.120
Division veterans drawing up plans in the 50s and 60s, or developers and local boosters

02:50.120 --> 02:54.600
dreaming up lift lines and base villages in the decades since, skiing offered a lifeline

02:54.600 --> 02:57.720
to communities on the verge of collapse.

02:57.720 --> 03:00.940
From the start, the ski business was pretty simple.

03:00.940 --> 03:04.800
Offer lift services, groom managed terrain and on-mountain restaurants, like a theme

03:04.800 --> 03:09.120
park would, and charge a daily fee for the services, like a theme park would.

03:09.120 --> 03:12.760
Employ the established locals to build new hotels and housing to keep up with increasing

03:12.760 --> 03:13.760
traffic.

03:13.760 --> 03:18.680
Employ eager new arrivals hoping to become locals in the ski school and ticket offices.

03:18.680 --> 03:22.760
Offer a season pass for locals and serious skiers to keep some cash on hand in fall and

03:22.760 --> 03:23.920
early winter.

03:23.920 --> 03:27.320
Pray for snow to draw in the day pass crowds, then reinvest those earnings in the summer

03:27.320 --> 03:30.980
into fancier lodges and amenities to get the higher dollar customers who didn't drive

03:30.980 --> 03:34.800
up from the nearest town, but flew in from the nearest city.

03:34.800 --> 03:36.600
The model wasn't unique.

03:36.600 --> 03:40.840
When the chances presented, all industries looked to corner the highest-yield customers.

03:40.840 --> 03:44.960
It wasn't complicated either—Hope Mother Nature provided the goods and built out all

03:44.960 --> 03:49.320
the infrastructure, from housing and hotels to tramlines and terrain parks, to maximize

03:49.320 --> 03:50.600
earnings when she did.

03:50.600 --> 03:53.080
And it certainly wasn't flexible.

03:53.080 --> 03:57.220
The more terrain the resort added, or the more snowmaking it required, the more it charged

03:57.220 --> 03:58.680
for a day pass.

03:58.680 --> 04:02.800
Competing for attention from the world's wealthiest, ski resorts added and built and

04:02.800 --> 04:04.120
added and built.

04:04.120 --> 04:07.160
The race to the top reinvigorated ski towns.

04:07.160 --> 04:14.240
Then, as land and housing ran low and popularity reached its zenith, it began to squeeze them.

04:14.240 --> 04:18.280
Regardless of the strain between ski company and ski town, this business model worked through

04:18.280 --> 04:22.320
the 2000s until suddenly it didn't.

04:22.320 --> 04:27.280
The issue wasn't existential yet, but the trends and forecasts indicated that it could

04:27.280 --> 04:29.240
soon become so.

04:29.240 --> 04:33.040
Skier numbers reached their high point in the late aughts and early 2010s, and then

04:33.040 --> 04:34.040
they plateaued.

04:34.040 --> 04:40.080
2007 through 2010 were good years, some of the best in fact in terms of total ski days,

04:40.080 --> 04:42.560
but then the numbers fell.

04:42.560 --> 04:46.960
A similar pattern emerged in the number of individual skiers participating in the sport.

04:46.960 --> 04:52.480
From 2008 to 2016, the number of unique skiers in the US, or individuals that participated

04:52.480 --> 04:57.680
in the sport that year, topped out at 10 million, and then began to drop.

04:57.680 --> 05:00.680
Warm, dry weather was partly to blame.

05:01.080 --> 05:04.000
But weather alone wasn't a worthy excuse.

05:04.000 --> 05:09.160
Low snow and shorter winters were, after all, going to be a factor going forward anyway.

05:09.160 --> 05:13.840
Rather, the sport was just too expensive.

05:13.840 --> 05:19.040
Day passes were reaching $200, season passes well over $1,000.

05:19.040 --> 05:23.320
Making things worse, the people who had grown up on resort skiing were aging.

05:23.320 --> 05:28.520
The industry's race to the top made the sport entirely too expensive and too old.

05:28.520 --> 05:34.400
Then, Vail Resorts came and entirely reimagined the industry.

05:34.400 --> 05:36.600
Vail is a town.

05:36.600 --> 05:40.920
A manufactured Alps-like village bisected by Interstate 70 about an hour and a half

05:40.920 --> 05:46.680
long drive from Denver, Vail Ski Resort, understandably, towers over the town of Vail.

05:46.680 --> 05:52.480
But nowhere in this resort or this town will you find the offices of Vail Resorts, or MTN

05:52.480 --> 05:54.440
as it's labeled on the New York Stock Exchange.

05:54.440 --> 05:57.360
They're just not here.

05:57.360 --> 06:02.560
This is a sign of something bigger—that Vail Resorts the company has effectively decoupled

06:02.560 --> 06:08.920
itself from the physical ski resort, and in doing so, has transformed the industry.

06:08.920 --> 06:14.000
Since the early 2000s, Vail Resorts has owned and managed Vail, Beaver Creek, and Keystone

06:14.000 --> 06:17.120
in Colorado, along with Heavenly in California.

06:17.120 --> 06:22.280
This wasn't necessarily unique—KSL Capital, Powder, Molson Silver International, and even

06:22.280 --> 06:26.940
Sinclair Oil had all collected an arrangement of North American ski resorts.

06:27.520 --> 06:31.280
What Vail Resorts did that made it unique was that, as ski numbers began to stagnate,

06:31.280 --> 06:33.140
it went on a spending spree.

06:33.140 --> 06:36.580
In 2012, the conglomerate bought three smaller resorts.

06:36.580 --> 06:39.760
In 2013, it bought the prestigious Canyons Resort in Utah.

06:39.760 --> 06:42.100
The following year, it bought Park City.

06:42.100 --> 06:44.940
Then it went international, purchasing an Australian resort.

06:44.940 --> 06:50.980
From 2016 to 2018, Vail went even bigger, taking over iconic resorts in Whistler-Blackcomb,

06:50.980 --> 06:52.700
Stowe, and Crested Butte.

06:52.700 --> 06:57.780
In 2019, it bought Peak Resorts, which owned 17 areas across the Midwest and Northeast.

06:57.780 --> 07:02.940
In the face of worrying winters and aging skiers, Vail began scooping up resorts—some

07:02.940 --> 07:08.260
of them tiny, some of them world-class, but all of them now available on a single-season

07:08.260 --> 07:09.620
pass.

07:09.620 --> 07:14.580
To little fanfare, Vail launched the Epic Pass in 2008, offering its buyers unlimited

07:14.580 --> 07:18.380
skiing at any of the five Vail-run resorts.

07:18.380 --> 07:22.320
And oddly, for a pass that boasted some of the best skiing in the Rockies, the price

07:22.320 --> 07:28.240
was low—very low—only $579 for an unlimited pass.

07:28.240 --> 07:36.360
For comparison, an Aspen pass that same season, at its very cheapest, was $1,769—more than

07:36.360 --> 07:37.360
triple.

07:37.360 --> 07:42.200
Odder still, in the years that followed, as Vail bought up resorts and entered deals that

07:42.200 --> 07:47.100
gave Epic Pass holders access to top resorts like Telluride and Arapahoe Basin, the pass

07:47.100 --> 07:51.620
stayed cheap, at least for the industry, crossing the $800 plateau for the first time

07:51.620 --> 07:59.060
in 2015, and still managing to stay under the $1,000 mark all the way through 2024.

07:59.060 --> 08:03.940
The Epic Pass was and is, in the world of skiing, a cheap-season pass, but it was not

08:03.940 --> 08:07.620
a cheap product—it was an entirely new product.

08:07.620 --> 08:12.380
It wasn't meant for the hardened, ski-obsessed locals that hit the hill 100 days a season—it

08:12.380 --> 08:17.020
was for a market that had previously been served by day passes, multi-day punch passes,

08:17.020 --> 08:22.060
and those that had been priced out entirely—the 10-to-20-day-a-year skier of varying age,

08:22.060 --> 08:24.020
economic standing, and location.

08:24.020 --> 08:29.220
Now, the thinking went, a well-to-do businessperson in New York or Chicago or Boston could buy

08:29.220 --> 08:34.100
an Epic Pass and ski their nearby local hills every other Saturday and justify the purchase.

08:34.100 --> 08:39.240
If they wanted to ski in Colorado or Utah or British Columbia over a family vacation,

08:39.240 --> 08:40.460
they just had to get there.

08:40.460 --> 08:43.580
The skiing, at that point, would essentially be free.

08:43.580 --> 08:47.060
The penniless college kid who grew up skiing with their parents could ask for an Epic Pass

08:47.060 --> 08:48.060
for Christmas.

08:48.060 --> 08:51.380
They'd fulfill their obligations to ski with family over Christmas, then could load

08:51.380 --> 08:55.700
up with friends in Road Trip Rockies resorts staying in Airbnbs and avoiding prohibitively

08:55.700 --> 08:57.480
expensive lift tickets.

08:57.480 --> 09:01.740
The young professional living in Denver, Salt Lake City, Seattle, San Francisco, Boston,

09:01.740 --> 09:06.480
or even LA and New York could buy the pass and split the expense of day-long or weekend-long

09:06.480 --> 09:09.660
trips to the mountains with a host of like-minded friends.

09:09.660 --> 09:14.460
And, if they executed it right, what they'd lose in margins they'd make up in volume,

09:14.460 --> 09:18.840
creating a new and loyal customer base that didn't sit on the sidelines priced out and

09:18.840 --> 09:20.500
didn't pay for day passes.

09:20.500 --> 09:25.940
As this graph of total Epic Pass product purchases suggests, they executed it right.

09:25.940 --> 09:30.100
And as this 2023 Investors Conference report from the company boasts, they've gotten

09:30.100 --> 09:34.940
really good at getting customers to buy passes over lift tickets.

09:34.940 --> 09:37.860
The impact was bigger than Vail Resorts.

09:37.860 --> 09:42.100
With Vail's Epic Pass, and the emergence and maturation of a competitor, Alterra, and

09:42.100 --> 09:47.100
its Icon Pass boasting a similarly impressive list of mountains under its cheap Megapass,

09:47.100 --> 09:53.060
skiing was suddenly reinvigorated as 2018-19 visitor totals finally broke the near decade-long

09:53.060 --> 09:54.780
trend of flattening numbers.

09:54.780 --> 10:00.460
By the following season, the Megapass' takeover was complete—for the first time on record,

10:00.460 --> 10:06.540
the share of ski days logged on season passes outnumbered those on day and multi-day tickets.

10:06.540 --> 10:11.100
Through consolidation under two major umbrella brands, skiing got a shot in the arm.

10:11.100 --> 10:15.800
It became younger, slightly more accessible, and far more flexible.

10:15.800 --> 10:20.300
And under the two brands, the ski industry reinvented itself.

10:20.300 --> 10:25.620
Alterra and Vail had stable, predictable income stemming from non-weather-dependent pass sales,

10:25.620 --> 10:29.580
they had dependable cash flows to take on capital projects in the off-season, and they

10:29.580 --> 10:30.740
had bad weather insurance.

10:30.740 --> 10:35.060
If it didn't snow in one region, their losses would likely be cancelled out by a good snow

10:35.060 --> 10:37.400
year somewhere else.

10:37.400 --> 10:40.980
Without being tied to a single mountain, Vail could turn its focus to real estate development

10:40.980 --> 10:45.220
at the base of Vail Mountain, or marketing strategies for when it just wouldn't snow,

10:45.220 --> 10:46.580
or building out the Epic brand.

10:46.580 --> 10:52.600
In the process, as it sought to maximize profits for its shareholders, the company became omnipresent

10:52.600 --> 10:55.580
in the areas in which it operates.

10:55.580 --> 11:01.660
Vail the resort is here, nestled in a tight valley sitting at the base of some of Colorado's

11:01.660 --> 11:02.660
tallest peaks.

11:02.980 --> 11:08.060
The nearest airport, given its need for flat land, is 35 minutes away here, although many

11:08.060 --> 11:12.700
visitors choose to fly into here, the far larger Denver International Airport.

11:12.700 --> 11:16.840
Either way, Vail Resorts has made sure it's convenient to actually get to Vail itself

11:16.840 --> 11:21.820
with its Epic Mountain Express, offering $99 shared shuttles for the two-hour trip from

11:21.820 --> 11:26.060
Denver or $49 ones for the quicker drive from Eagle County Airport.

11:26.060 --> 11:31.780
For those that would balk at the prospect of sharing a shuttle, they also offer $319

11:31.780 --> 11:35.460
private SUVs on the same 35-minute drive.

11:35.460 --> 11:40.140
In all cases, as long as it's Epic Mountain Express, Epic Passholders, of course, get

11:40.140 --> 11:43.020
rewarded with 20% off.

11:43.020 --> 11:47.220
But on the other end of the shuttle, visitors need accommodation, and Vail, of course, has

11:47.220 --> 11:48.220
that handle too.

11:48.220 --> 11:52.700
There are Vail-owned hotels, like the Lodge at Vail, there are other hotels bookable through

11:52.700 --> 11:57.380
Vail, or there are independently-owned apartment and house rentals, managed by Vail-owned Legendary

11:57.380 --> 11:58.380
Lodging.

11:58.380 --> 12:02.860
In all cases, Epic Passholders get a discount once again.

12:02.860 --> 12:07.100
But to ski one needs skis, so next up on day one is the rental shop.

12:07.100 --> 12:13.220
Vail has that handled at Vail Sports, which, once again, offers discounts for Epic Passholders.

12:13.220 --> 12:17.580
Visitors also need jackets and pants and goggles and all sorts of non-rentable gear, so they

12:17.580 --> 12:22.060
could head to outposts of recognizable brands like Helly Hansen or Patagonia or the North

12:22.060 --> 12:23.060
Face.

12:23.060 --> 12:27.420
Yet, despite their branding, visitors are once again feeding money to the conglomerate

12:27.460 --> 12:33.740
as these two are Vail-owned and operated franchise stores, part of more than 250 Vail-owned retail

12:33.740 --> 12:35.900
stores around the world.

12:35.900 --> 12:39.740
After that is dinner, which, too, can be accomplished without giving a dollar to anyone but Vail

12:39.740 --> 12:44.060
at restaurants like Margie's House, then drinks at 10th Mountain at the Hythe Hotel.

12:44.060 --> 12:47.980
While skiing the next day, the trend can continue with dining at one of the dozens of Vail-run

12:47.980 --> 12:51.340
on-mountain restaurants, again with a discount for Passholders.

12:51.340 --> 12:55.160
Then, if the day ends and a visitor loves the lifestyle so much that they want to make

12:55.160 --> 12:58.800
it more regular, they could tour property listings with an agent from Sliffer, Smith,

12:58.800 --> 13:03.800
and Frampton—the largest real estate broker in the Vail Valley, which, also, is owned

13:03.800 --> 13:05.840
by Vail Resorts.

13:05.840 --> 13:10.240
While the most extreme example, the reality isn't far off from this.

13:10.240 --> 13:14.440
Facing natural pressures from shareholders to grow revenue, Vail is increasingly focused

13:14.440 --> 13:17.540
on vertically integrating the visitor experience.

13:17.540 --> 13:20.680
Why should a Vail visitor give money to anyone but Vail itself?

13:20.680 --> 13:25.080
They're developing offerings for almost any transaction a visitor could make, then

13:25.080 --> 13:29.860
incentivizing allegiance to the Epic system by offering a slew of discounts.

13:29.860 --> 13:34.680
In the process, Vail is competing against local businesses—they're eliminating one

13:34.680 --> 13:39.280
of the few opportunities for local success to be tied to their success.

13:39.280 --> 13:45.880
What's left is the financial impossibility of minimum wage work in the Vail Valley.

13:45.880 --> 13:50.520
There are no easy answers to where a Vail employee might start their day.

13:50.520 --> 13:55.040
The conglomerate's new minimum wage is $20 an hour, a near fortune compared to minimum

13:55.040 --> 13:59.360
wage at most entry-level jobs in America, but most entry-level jobs aren't located

13:59.360 --> 14:04.400
here, in a narrow mountain valley bounded by two often impassable sections of highway

14:04.400 --> 14:07.920
boasting some of the highest living costs in the world.

14:07.920 --> 14:13.320
Currently, the cheapest publicly listed apartment for rent within Vail city limits is going

14:13.320 --> 14:16.520
for $2,500 a month.

14:16.520 --> 14:20.280
Assuming 40 hours per week of work, which might come if the slopes are busy and the

14:20.280 --> 14:25.120
snow is abundant, a given lift operator might make $3,200 a month.

14:25.120 --> 14:30.060
Therefore, after tax, they might make ever so slightly more than what it costs to keep

14:30.060 --> 14:32.640
an apartment in the town in which they work.

14:32.640 --> 14:37.080
But of course, in a small-town environment like this, and considering the competitiveness

14:37.080 --> 14:41.240
of housing, most rentals never make it beyond the classifieds.

14:41.240 --> 14:46.880
Here one can find deals like this $1,150 a month room in an apartment in Edwards, a

14:46.880 --> 14:53.280
20 minute drive away, assuming one pays for the $425 a year Vail employee parking pass.

14:53.280 --> 14:59.160
This gets closer to the 28% of income financial experts recommend spending on housing.

14:59.160 --> 15:03.760
To get under that 28%, it's going to require an apartment with roommates somewhere like

15:03.760 --> 15:08.960
Eagle or Gypsum, more than 30 miles or 50 kilometers from Vail.

15:09.040 --> 15:14.040
Vail Resorts understands this financial impossibility, and their fix is to act as both the employer

15:14.040 --> 15:18.120
and the landlord with their employee housing program, offering hundreds of rooms near the

15:18.120 --> 15:21.540
resort for $500 or $600 a month.

15:21.540 --> 15:26.400
These tiny dorm-style accommodations are in tremendous demand, often filling up months

15:26.400 --> 15:30.760
before the start of the season, but never accommodating all workers, leaving hundreds

15:30.760 --> 15:34.840
to work through the financial impossibility of the free market.

15:34.840 --> 15:38.440
The truth is, these jobs don't need to be sustainable.

15:38.440 --> 15:43.020
Vail doesn't need to offer a living wage to fill its rosters.

15:43.020 --> 15:47.120
The pure prospect of being able to live in the mountains is attractive enough to incentivize

15:47.120 --> 15:51.760
plenty of financially flexible young people into working a season or two on the slopes,

15:51.760 --> 15:54.480
even if they might not make more than they spend.

15:54.480 --> 15:56.160
Vail knows this.

15:56.160 --> 15:59.320
Vail's mission statement even implies this.

15:59.320 --> 16:03.280
It reads, quote, our mission is simple, to create the experience of a lifetime for our

16:03.280 --> 16:08.660
employees, so they can, in turn, provide exceptional experiences for our guests.

16:08.660 --> 16:13.840
Creating a job so rewarding people are willing to effectively pay to do it is no crime, but

16:13.840 --> 16:18.620
what it does mean is that Vail's money doesn't stay in the Vail Valley.

16:18.620 --> 16:23.320
It primarily goes to a transient, short-term labor pool that'll be gone come spring,

16:23.320 --> 16:26.860
never integrating with the long-term local community.

16:26.860 --> 16:31.520
Of course, there are some resort jobs that require more specialized skills and pay more,

16:31.520 --> 16:32.720
but not many.

16:32.720 --> 16:37.040
Ski Patrol, for example, is a dangerous job that requires skills that take years to learn,

16:37.040 --> 16:41.680
so it's a role typically filled by careerists rather than transient seasonal workers, but

16:41.680 --> 16:48.000
in Vail's case, that only justifies a $21 minimum wage—a menial bump over the resort-wide

16:48.000 --> 16:50.000
$20 minimum.

16:50.000 --> 16:51.880
But Vail's a big business, right?

16:51.880 --> 16:55.600
It's a publicly traded company on the New York Stock Exchange.

16:55.600 --> 16:59.720
Surely it must have HR and marketing and vice presidents and executives and all the higher-paying

16:59.720 --> 17:03.120
jobs that make for more sustainable urban economies, right?

17:03.120 --> 17:07.560
Well, yes, Vail does have that, just not in Vail.

17:07.560 --> 17:12.480
In 2006, the conglomerate moved about 100 of its administrative positions two hours

17:12.480 --> 17:15.800
down the road to an office park outside Denver.

17:15.800 --> 17:20.120
Because of the living costs that Vail itself pushed up, it was simply cheaper for Vail

17:20.120 --> 17:23.380
to run Vail away from Vail.

17:23.380 --> 17:27.580
Through time, with each resort it gobbled up, it slowly cut local management positions

17:27.580 --> 17:32.140
and aggregated administrative tasks in this Denver headquarters, meaning the resorts themselves

17:32.140 --> 17:38.060
were left with few jobs outside mountain operations, hospitality, and retail—the lowest paying,

17:38.060 --> 17:39.900
least sustainable positions.

17:39.900 --> 17:44.880
Therefore, in sum, what happens when Vail buys a resort is simple—income potential

17:44.880 --> 17:49.920
lowers as jobs get slashed and cost-of-living rockets skyward as the volume of visitors

17:49.920 --> 17:52.180
and therefore demand does too.

17:52.440 --> 17:58.440
Now, Vail itself, the resort from which the conglomerate was born, was never truly a town.

17:58.440 --> 18:02.960
It was a development from day one, so, at least within city limits, the argument can

18:02.960 --> 18:08.000
be made that nobody's been displaced—there's no history of habitation before the lifts

18:08.000 --> 18:09.000
started spinning.

18:09.000 --> 18:11.720
But this is not the case everywhere.

18:11.720 --> 18:17.520
60 miles or 100 kilometers away, in the tiny, idyllic town of Crested Butte, the Facebook

18:17.520 --> 18:22.620
comments on the 2018 announcement of Vail's purchase of the local resort read like those

18:22.620 --> 18:24.240
of an obituary.

18:24.240 --> 18:28.620
This was a ski resort that ran a marketing campaign titled This Is Not Vail and a locale

18:28.620 --> 18:33.820
referred to as the Last Great Colorado Ski Town, noted for its increasingly unique blend

18:33.820 --> 18:37.020
of affordability, remoteness, and skiing prowess.

18:37.020 --> 18:42.340
Now, this tenuous balance was going to get disrupted by the world's largest skiing

18:42.340 --> 18:47.340
conglomerate, and it was absolutely disrupted.

18:47.340 --> 18:50.880
Whereas in the month of Vail's announcement, the average sales price of a single-family

18:50.880 --> 18:57.600
home in Crested Butte sat at $762,000, today, less than five years on, it skyrocketed to

18:57.600 --> 19:00.220
over 1.2 million.

19:00.220 --> 19:04.400
The same, all-too-predictable story played out once again.

19:04.400 --> 19:09.260
Big tracts of open land were split up, sold off, and converted into five, ten, or fifteen

19:09.260 --> 19:10.880
million dollar ranches.

19:10.880 --> 19:15.000
Downtown houses previously home to locals working just blocks away were bought up, renovated,

19:15.000 --> 19:19.180
and sold as second homes and investment properties to those earning an income in Dallas, Miami,

19:19.180 --> 19:20.180
or New York.

19:20.180 --> 19:23.740
The workforce that kept the town ticking was pushed farther and farther down valley, and

19:23.740 --> 19:28.400
the small city of Gunnison increasingly became the bedroom of decades-long Crested Butte

19:28.400 --> 19:29.400
locals.

19:29.400 --> 19:34.580
There was a brief moment of homeostasis in the North American ski industry, an era when

19:34.580 --> 19:40.700
it could all coexist, but in today's reality, skiing is simply extractive.

19:40.700 --> 19:44.980
Coastal money comes in and, despite good intentions, it pushes up the cost of living, it crowds

19:44.980 --> 19:49.320
out the locals, and then ultimately, that money doesn't go to the locals it's displacing,

19:49.320 --> 19:51.960
it goes to the shareholders of a conglomerate.

19:51.960 --> 19:57.320
But this phenomenon is familiar to these towns, given their histories in mining, logging,

19:57.320 --> 19:59.600
and other resource-based economies.

19:59.600 --> 20:04.460
The way their populations could make a living all centered around quite literally extracting

20:04.460 --> 20:06.800
value from the surrounding nature.

20:06.800 --> 20:11.780
The story of a struggle between small communities and big mining conglomerates is a tale so

20:11.780 --> 20:14.760
archetypical that it hardly bears repeating.

20:14.760 --> 20:18.340
In fact, the similarities between Crested Butte's history and the plot of the movie

20:18.340 --> 20:24.780
Avatar are so striking that many have pondered if the film was directly inspired by the town.

20:24.780 --> 20:29.300
Skiing was supposed to be the way out, the path forward, a way to have it all, in-come-to-live

20:29.300 --> 20:34.340
in America's most striking nature, coming from an industry far less destructive to that

20:34.340 --> 20:35.340
nature.

20:35.340 --> 20:41.500
But the long-run consequences of this turned out to be the destruction of the towns themselves.

20:41.500 --> 20:45.360
It appears a devil's bargain—you can have the nature and the town, but not the

20:45.360 --> 20:46.820
in-come-to-live there.

20:46.820 --> 20:50.200
You can have the town and the in-come, but not the nature to enjoy.

20:50.200 --> 20:54.760
Or, as so many of the most pristine slices of the mountains have chosen, you can have

20:54.760 --> 20:59.100
the nature and the in-come, but you cede the town.

20:59.100 --> 21:04.520
Unnatural forces can flex this triangle, can allow for a careful, tenuous balance of the

21:04.520 --> 21:09.720
three factors, but it's tremendously difficult to maintain through the decades.

21:09.740 --> 21:14.740
Therefore, Vale and other conglomerates didn't create this devil's bargain, but rather

21:14.740 --> 21:18.540
their influences made the decisions for the communities.

21:18.540 --> 21:23.260
Small, delicate towns were forced into option number three.

21:23.260 --> 21:28.540
They'd have jobs, more than they could possibly need or even want, and they'd have nature,

21:28.540 --> 21:32.060
even if it'd be stressed to its limits by an influx of past holding visitors, but they'd

21:32.060 --> 21:35.620
no longer have affordable access to their own town.

21:35.620 --> 21:39.220
It's a tricky thing, housing affordability.

21:39.220 --> 21:43.320
Even the largest cities, states, and even countries have repeatedly failed to stop the

21:43.320 --> 21:48.180
savage economic forces that break the careful balance of income and cost, so the issue is

21:48.180 --> 21:51.000
certainly not unique to ski towns.

21:51.000 --> 21:56.200
The primary difference is that they're phenomenally more vulnerable to outside forces.

21:56.200 --> 22:01.580
These towns are truly tiny—Aspen, Telluride, and Breckenridge combined have a full-time

22:01.580 --> 22:07.400
population smaller than innumerable American towns whose names you'll never even hear,

22:07.400 --> 22:08.680
let alone know.

22:08.940 --> 22:14.360
Therefore, one small outside action, one boardroom decision to sign on the dotted line and sail

22:14.360 --> 22:19.360
to the highest bidder, has the potential to fundamentally alter and fracture an entire

22:19.360 --> 22:20.360
community.

22:20.360 --> 22:24.620
But this might just be the tragic trade-off of small-town life.

22:24.620 --> 22:29.580
It's the story of the local factory getting automated, the story of the mine closing up

22:29.580 --> 22:35.280
shop, the new interstate shortcutting the old highway, the railroad stopping service.

22:35.280 --> 22:39.960
Both places are vulnerable, and while this doesn't necessarily need to be the conclusion

22:39.960 --> 22:45.220
of life in these mountain communities, it does seem an inevitable step in their perpetual

22:45.220 --> 22:46.220
evolution.

22:46.220 --> 22:51.280
If there's one thing the uninitiated might have noticed in this video, it's that skiing

22:51.280 --> 22:54.200
is unbelievably expensive.

22:54.200 --> 22:58.560
Why does it cost each visitor one or two thousand dollars to get access to land that is actually

22:58.560 --> 23:01.920
government-owned, covered in snow, that falls naturally?

23:02.240 --> 23:06.960
Well, the truth is that making those slopes actually safely ski-able, and more so enjoyable

23:06.960 --> 23:11.280
for thousands or even millions of people, is a tremendous amount of work.

23:11.280 --> 23:15.920
There are an unbelievable number of daily, monthly, and yearly steps involved just to

23:15.920 --> 23:20.480
allow for those seven or eight hours a day of skiing, and we wanted to dive deeper into

23:20.480 --> 23:23.800
them—far deeper than we could in this already long video.

23:23.800 --> 23:29.600
That's why I'm extremely excited to announce our brand new Nebula original series called

23:29.600 --> 23:32.040
the Logistics of X.

23:32.040 --> 23:35.600
Every few Wendover videos, if there's some sort of underlying logistics to their topic

23:35.600 --> 23:39.160
worth exploring, we're going to dive deeper into it on Nebula.

23:39.160 --> 23:43.400
And these are not low-effort companion videos—we produce these the exact same way we produce

23:43.400 --> 23:48.120
Wendover videos, with the exact same budget, effort, everything, so they're just as good,

23:48.120 --> 23:49.120
if not better.

23:49.120 --> 23:52.840
And the first one, the Logistics of Ski Resorts, is up now.

23:52.840 --> 23:56.780
I think it came together really nicely, with stunning 3D visuals and some really interesting

23:56.780 --> 24:00.520
deep dives into things like the mad rush to install a lift in the few summer months

24:00.520 --> 24:04.320
when the ground is snow-free, how you manage the snow to prevent a deadly avalanche, and

24:04.320 --> 24:07.980
also the incredible overnight process of grooming the slopes to make them accessible to beginner

24:07.980 --> 24:08.980
skiers.

24:08.980 --> 24:13.040
Basically, we know you all love our logistics videos and we want to make even more of them,

24:13.040 --> 24:16.380
getting even more into the nitty-gritty, and this series is the way.

24:16.380 --> 24:19.740
And the reason we're able to do this is thanks to Nebula—for those of you who don't

24:19.740 --> 24:24.100
know, Nebula is a creator-run streaming service that I co-founded in 2019 that now has over

24:24.100 --> 24:26.460
650,000 paying subscribers.

24:26.460 --> 24:30.300
And these are not subscriptions that people forgot to cancel—we have one of the highest

24:30.300 --> 24:34.660
proportions of daily active users in the industry because creators are able to use the unique

24:34.660 --> 24:37.820
economic model to do stuff they can't on YouTube.

24:37.820 --> 24:41.740
Some channels, like Jetlag the Game release episodes early, others, like RealLifeLaura

24:41.740 --> 24:45.140
and NowWendover, make series allowing you to dive deeper on the topics you watch on

24:45.140 --> 24:49.920
YouTube, others still, like Patrick Willems or Abigail Thorne, make huge, ambitious dream

24:49.920 --> 24:54.060
projects with the bigger budgets that Nebula is able to offer, but in addition to all of

24:54.060 --> 24:58.260
that, all creators release their normal videos ad- and sponsorship-free.

24:58.260 --> 25:02.860
Nebula is not really designed to be a replacement to YouTube, but rather an expansion pack.

25:02.860 --> 25:06.880
There are limitations of the algorithmic-driven, ad-supported video model, so Nebula is able

25:06.880 --> 25:11.180
to offer a creative ecosystem that unlocks more and therefore is a better experience

25:11.180 --> 25:13.620
for the creator and you, the viewer.

25:13.620 --> 25:18.120
When you sign up at our link, nebula.tv slash wendover, we actually get a portion of your

25:18.120 --> 25:22.620
subscription fee for as long as you stay subscribed, which gives us predictable, stable monthly

25:22.620 --> 25:27.180
income, not impacted by the shift in ad rates, that allows us to confidently reinvest in

25:27.180 --> 25:28.180
the channel.

25:28.180 --> 25:31.460
Tens of thousands of Wendover viewers have already signed up, and the vast majority are

25:31.460 --> 25:34.580
still subscribed so clearly they find it worth it.

25:34.580 --> 25:38.380
So if you want to watch the logistics of ski resorts, the future episodes we add to that

25:38.380 --> 25:41.820
series, and everything else Nebula has to offer, click the button on screen or head
