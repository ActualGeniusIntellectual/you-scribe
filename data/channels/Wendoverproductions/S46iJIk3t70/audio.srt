1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,180
This is a town—legally, at least.

2
00:00:04,180 --> 00:00:07,160
So is this and this and this.

3
00:00:07,160 --> 00:00:11,860
Each displays the characteristics of an idyllic small-town community, but largely in the same

4
00:00:11,860 --> 00:00:17,540
way Main Street Disney displays the characteristics of an idyllic small-town community.

5
00:00:17,540 --> 00:00:22,580
These were towns—they were vibrant communities filled with average Americans living their

6
00:00:22,580 --> 00:00:25,700
mountain dreams—but they've been gutted.

7
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:31,140
They've had their cores ripped out by economic forces from afar, leaving only a shell propped

8
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:36,300
up by the resilient few willing to fight to keep the dream alive.

9
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:39,680
North American ski towns are peppered across remote corners of the continent's least

10
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:43,740
populous regions, yet for four months in the winter and three in the summer, they become

11
00:00:43,740 --> 00:00:48,360
bustling destinations with jets, both public and private, shuttling in thousands of visitors

12
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:52,900
from California, Texas, Florida, and beyond daily, each on a brief reprieve from urban

13
00:00:52,900 --> 00:00:55,940
life to soak in the crisp, light mountain air.

14
00:00:55,940 --> 00:01:00,860
For the five other months of the year, though, these verge on ghost towns.

15
00:01:00,860 --> 00:01:05,620
In Breckenridge, for example, just 20% of housing units are occupied by full-time residents,

16
00:01:05,620 --> 00:01:09,780
meaning in those five months of off-season, neighbors aren't next door—they're on

17
00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:11,560
the next block.

18
00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:16,220
With the infrastructure to support more than five times the population, streets simply

19
00:01:16,220 --> 00:01:17,940
sit empty.

20
00:01:17,980 --> 00:01:23,580
On the other side of the Swatch Range, in Crested Butte, only 14 of 43 restaurants kept

21
00:01:23,580 --> 00:01:28,260
open through the last spring off-season, and even of those, many kept drastically reduced

22
00:01:28,260 --> 00:01:31,700
hours and limited menus for the limited, local covers.

23
00:01:31,700 --> 00:01:36,620
And across the Elk Mountain Range, in Aspen, even the airport closes for its theoretically

24
00:01:36,620 --> 00:01:41,680
irregular but in practice annual two-week runway maintenance procedure.

25
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:46,540
One could assume that this soullessness is the inevitable byproduct of life in a remote

26
00:01:46,540 --> 00:01:50,700
tourism-based economy, but history hardly supports this view.

27
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:54,660
While today it appears that there's some sort of fundamental incompatibility between

28
00:01:54,660 --> 00:01:59,220
ski resorts and ski towns, the very fact that they're called ski towns demonstrates that

29
00:01:59,220 --> 00:02:04,200
there was once a time when it was all possible—there was a time when a remote mountain town could

30
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:06,380
just have a ski area.

31
00:02:06,380 --> 00:02:11,100
In the early days, the resorts were not what gutted the communities, but rather what kept

32
00:02:11,100 --> 00:02:13,280
them alive.

33
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:17,420
Before the rugged rural reaches of North America, blessed with consistent snowfall and north-facing

34
00:02:17,420 --> 00:02:20,880
slopes for ski towns, they were boomtowns gone bust.

35
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:26,120
Aspen, Telluride, Crested Butte, Breckenridge, Park City—all mining towns whose best days

36
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:27,280
were behind them.

37
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:31,680
Or, they were rugged resource towns run on logging like Truckee and Revelstoke.

38
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:36,560
Or, like Vail and Snowmass Village, they weren't towns at all, just ranch land and old mining

39
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:37,640
claims.

40
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:41,440
But one by one, they all blossomed into ski towns.

41
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:45,560
And whether it was Austrian expats helping lay rope-toes in the 30s and 40s, 10th Mountain

42
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:50,120
Division veterans drawing up plans in the 50s and 60s, or developers and local boosters

43
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:54,600
dreaming up lift lines and base villages in the decades since, skiing offered a lifeline

44
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:57,720
to communities on the verge of collapse.

45
00:02:57,720 --> 00:03:00,940
From the start, the ski business was pretty simple.

46
00:03:00,940 --> 00:03:04,800
Offer lift services, groom managed terrain and on-mountain restaurants, like a theme

47
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:09,120
park would, and charge a daily fee for the services, like a theme park would.

48
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:12,760
Employ the established locals to build new hotels and housing to keep up with increasing

49
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:13,760
traffic.

50
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:18,680
Employ eager new arrivals hoping to become locals in the ski school and ticket offices.

51
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:22,760
Offer a season pass for locals and serious skiers to keep some cash on hand in fall and

52
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:23,920
early winter.

53
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:27,320
Pray for snow to draw in the day pass crowds, then reinvest those earnings in the summer

54
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:30,980
into fancier lodges and amenities to get the higher dollar customers who didn't drive

55
00:03:30,980 --> 00:03:34,800
up from the nearest town, but flew in from the nearest city.

56
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:36,600
The model wasn't unique.

57
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:40,840
When the chances presented, all industries looked to corner the highest-yield customers.

58
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:44,960
It wasn't complicated either—Hope Mother Nature provided the goods and built out all

59
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:49,320
the infrastructure, from housing and hotels to tramlines and terrain parks, to maximize

60
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:50,600
earnings when she did.

61
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:53,080
And it certainly wasn't flexible.

62
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:57,220
The more terrain the resort added, or the more snowmaking it required, the more it charged

63
00:03:57,220 --> 00:03:58,680
for a day pass.

64
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:02,800
Competing for attention from the world's wealthiest, ski resorts added and built and

65
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:04,120
added and built.

66
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:07,160
The race to the top reinvigorated ski towns.

67
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:14,240
Then, as land and housing ran low and popularity reached its zenith, it began to squeeze them.

68
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:18,280
Regardless of the strain between ski company and ski town, this business model worked through

69
00:04:18,280 --> 00:04:22,320
the 2000s until suddenly it didn't.

70
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:27,280
The issue wasn't existential yet, but the trends and forecasts indicated that it could

71
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:29,240
soon become so.

72
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:33,040
Skier numbers reached their high point in the late aughts and early 2010s, and then

73
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:34,040
they plateaued.

74
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:40,080
2007 through 2010 were good years, some of the best in fact in terms of total ski days,

75
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:42,560
but then the numbers fell.

76
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:46,960
A similar pattern emerged in the number of individual skiers participating in the sport.

77
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:52,480
From 2008 to 2016, the number of unique skiers in the US, or individuals that participated

78
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:57,680
in the sport that year, topped out at 10 million, and then began to drop.

79
00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:00,680
Warm, dry weather was partly to blame.

80
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:04,000
But weather alone wasn't a worthy excuse.

81
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:09,160
Low snow and shorter winters were, after all, going to be a factor going forward anyway.

82
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:13,840
Rather, the sport was just too expensive.

83
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:19,040
Day passes were reaching $200, season passes well over $1,000.

84
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:23,320
Making things worse, the people who had grown up on resort skiing were aging.

85
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:28,520
The industry's race to the top made the sport entirely too expensive and too old.

86
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:34,400
Then, Vail Resorts came and entirely reimagined the industry.

87
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:36,600
Vail is a town.

88
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:40,920
A manufactured Alps-like village bisected by Interstate 70 about an hour and a half

89
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:46,680
long drive from Denver, Vail Ski Resort, understandably, towers over the town of Vail.

90
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:52,480
But nowhere in this resort or this town will you find the offices of Vail Resorts, or MTN

91
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:54,440
as it's labeled on the New York Stock Exchange.

92
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:57,360
They're just not here.

93
00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:02,560
This is a sign of something bigger—that Vail Resorts the company has effectively decoupled

94
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:08,920
itself from the physical ski resort, and in doing so, has transformed the industry.

95
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:14,000
Since the early 2000s, Vail Resorts has owned and managed Vail, Beaver Creek, and Keystone

96
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:17,120
in Colorado, along with Heavenly in California.

97
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:22,280
This wasn't necessarily unique—KSL Capital, Powder, Molson Silver International, and even

98
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:26,940
Sinclair Oil had all collected an arrangement of North American ski resorts.

99
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:31,280
What Vail Resorts did that made it unique was that, as ski numbers began to stagnate,

100
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:33,140
it went on a spending spree.

101
00:06:33,140 --> 00:06:36,580
In 2012, the conglomerate bought three smaller resorts.

102
00:06:36,580 --> 00:06:39,760
In 2013, it bought the prestigious Canyons Resort in Utah.

103
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:42,100
The following year, it bought Park City.

104
00:06:42,100 --> 00:06:44,940
Then it went international, purchasing an Australian resort.

105
00:06:44,940 --> 00:06:50,980
From 2016 to 2018, Vail went even bigger, taking over iconic resorts in Whistler-Blackcomb,

106
00:06:50,980 --> 00:06:52,700
Stowe, and Crested Butte.

107
00:06:52,700 --> 00:06:57,780
In 2019, it bought Peak Resorts, which owned 17 areas across the Midwest and Northeast.

108
00:06:57,780 --> 00:07:02,940
In the face of worrying winters and aging skiers, Vail began scooping up resorts—some

109
00:07:02,940 --> 00:07:08,260
of them tiny, some of them world-class, but all of them now available on a single-season

110
00:07:08,260 --> 00:07:09,620
pass.

111
00:07:09,620 --> 00:07:14,580
To little fanfare, Vail launched the Epic Pass in 2008, offering its buyers unlimited

112
00:07:14,580 --> 00:07:18,380
skiing at any of the five Vail-run resorts.

113
00:07:18,380 --> 00:07:22,320
And oddly, for a pass that boasted some of the best skiing in the Rockies, the price

114
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:28,240
was low—very low—only $579 for an unlimited pass.

115
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:36,360
For comparison, an Aspen pass that same season, at its very cheapest, was $1,769—more than

116
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:37,360
triple.

117
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:42,200
Odder still, in the years that followed, as Vail bought up resorts and entered deals that

118
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:47,100
gave Epic Pass holders access to top resorts like Telluride and Arapahoe Basin, the pass

119
00:07:47,100 --> 00:07:51,620
stayed cheap, at least for the industry, crossing the $800 plateau for the first time

120
00:07:51,620 --> 00:07:59,060
in 2015, and still managing to stay under the $1,000 mark all the way through 2024.

121
00:07:59,060 --> 00:08:03,940
The Epic Pass was and is, in the world of skiing, a cheap-season pass, but it was not

122
00:08:03,940 --> 00:08:07,620
a cheap product—it was an entirely new product.

123
00:08:07,620 --> 00:08:12,380
It wasn't meant for the hardened, ski-obsessed locals that hit the hill 100 days a season—it

124
00:08:12,380 --> 00:08:17,020
was for a market that had previously been served by day passes, multi-day punch passes,

125
00:08:17,020 --> 00:08:22,060
and those that had been priced out entirely—the 10-to-20-day-a-year skier of varying age,

126
00:08:22,060 --> 00:08:24,020
economic standing, and location.

127
00:08:24,020 --> 00:08:29,220
Now, the thinking went, a well-to-do businessperson in New York or Chicago or Boston could buy

128
00:08:29,220 --> 00:08:34,100
an Epic Pass and ski their nearby local hills every other Saturday and justify the purchase.

129
00:08:34,100 --> 00:08:39,240
If they wanted to ski in Colorado or Utah or British Columbia over a family vacation,

130
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:40,460
they just had to get there.

131
00:08:40,460 --> 00:08:43,580
The skiing, at that point, would essentially be free.

132
00:08:43,580 --> 00:08:47,060
The penniless college kid who grew up skiing with their parents could ask for an Epic Pass

133
00:08:47,060 --> 00:08:48,060
for Christmas.

134
00:08:48,060 --> 00:08:51,380
They'd fulfill their obligations to ski with family over Christmas, then could load

135
00:08:51,380 --> 00:08:55,700
up with friends in Road Trip Rockies resorts staying in Airbnbs and avoiding prohibitively

136
00:08:55,700 --> 00:08:57,480
expensive lift tickets.

137
00:08:57,480 --> 00:09:01,740
The young professional living in Denver, Salt Lake City, Seattle, San Francisco, Boston,

138
00:09:01,740 --> 00:09:06,480
or even LA and New York could buy the pass and split the expense of day-long or weekend-long

139
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:09,660
trips to the mountains with a host of like-minded friends.

140
00:09:09,660 --> 00:09:14,460
And, if they executed it right, what they'd lose in margins they'd make up in volume,

141
00:09:14,460 --> 00:09:18,840
creating a new and loyal customer base that didn't sit on the sidelines priced out and

142
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:20,500
didn't pay for day passes.

143
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:25,940
As this graph of total Epic Pass product purchases suggests, they executed it right.

144
00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:30,100
And as this 2023 Investors Conference report from the company boasts, they've gotten

145
00:09:30,100 --> 00:09:34,940
really good at getting customers to buy passes over lift tickets.

146
00:09:34,940 --> 00:09:37,860
The impact was bigger than Vail Resorts.

147
00:09:37,860 --> 00:09:42,100
With Vail's Epic Pass, and the emergence and maturation of a competitor, Alterra, and

148
00:09:42,100 --> 00:09:47,100
its Icon Pass boasting a similarly impressive list of mountains under its cheap Megapass,

149
00:09:47,100 --> 00:09:53,060
skiing was suddenly reinvigorated as 2018-19 visitor totals finally broke the near decade-long

150
00:09:53,060 --> 00:09:54,780
trend of flattening numbers.

151
00:09:54,780 --> 00:10:00,460
By the following season, the Megapass' takeover was complete—for the first time on record,

152
00:10:00,460 --> 00:10:06,540
the share of ski days logged on season passes outnumbered those on day and multi-day tickets.

153
00:10:06,540 --> 00:10:11,100
Through consolidation under two major umbrella brands, skiing got a shot in the arm.

154
00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:15,800
It became younger, slightly more accessible, and far more flexible.

155
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:20,300
And under the two brands, the ski industry reinvented itself.

156
00:10:20,300 --> 00:10:25,620
Alterra and Vail had stable, predictable income stemming from non-weather-dependent pass sales,

157
00:10:25,620 --> 00:10:29,580
they had dependable cash flows to take on capital projects in the off-season, and they

158
00:10:29,580 --> 00:10:30,740
had bad weather insurance.

159
00:10:30,740 --> 00:10:35,060
If it didn't snow in one region, their losses would likely be cancelled out by a good snow

160
00:10:35,060 --> 00:10:37,400
year somewhere else.

161
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:40,980
Without being tied to a single mountain, Vail could turn its focus to real estate development

162
00:10:40,980 --> 00:10:45,220
at the base of Vail Mountain, or marketing strategies for when it just wouldn't snow,

163
00:10:45,220 --> 00:10:46,580
or building out the Epic brand.

164
00:10:46,580 --> 00:10:52,600
In the process, as it sought to maximize profits for its shareholders, the company became omnipresent

165
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:55,580
in the areas in which it operates.

166
00:10:55,580 --> 00:11:01,660
Vail the resort is here, nestled in a tight valley sitting at the base of some of Colorado's

167
00:11:01,660 --> 00:11:02,660
tallest peaks.

168
00:11:02,980 --> 00:11:08,060
The nearest airport, given its need for flat land, is 35 minutes away here, although many

169
00:11:08,060 --> 00:11:12,700
visitors choose to fly into here, the far larger Denver International Airport.

170
00:11:12,700 --> 00:11:16,840
Either way, Vail Resorts has made sure it's convenient to actually get to Vail itself

171
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:21,820
with its Epic Mountain Express, offering $99 shared shuttles for the two-hour trip from

172
00:11:21,820 --> 00:11:26,060
Denver or $49 ones for the quicker drive from Eagle County Airport.

173
00:11:26,060 --> 00:11:31,780
For those that would balk at the prospect of sharing a shuttle, they also offer $319

174
00:11:31,780 --> 00:11:35,460
private SUVs on the same 35-minute drive.

175
00:11:35,460 --> 00:11:40,140
In all cases, as long as it's Epic Mountain Express, Epic Passholders, of course, get

176
00:11:40,140 --> 00:11:43,020
rewarded with 20% off.

177
00:11:43,020 --> 00:11:47,220
But on the other end of the shuttle, visitors need accommodation, and Vail, of course, has

178
00:11:47,220 --> 00:11:48,220
that handle too.

179
00:11:48,220 --> 00:11:52,700
There are Vail-owned hotels, like the Lodge at Vail, there are other hotels bookable through

180
00:11:52,700 --> 00:11:57,380
Vail, or there are independently-owned apartment and house rentals, managed by Vail-owned Legendary

181
00:11:57,380 --> 00:11:58,380
Lodging.

182
00:11:58,380 --> 00:12:02,860
In all cases, Epic Passholders get a discount once again.

183
00:12:02,860 --> 00:12:07,100
But to ski one needs skis, so next up on day one is the rental shop.

184
00:12:07,100 --> 00:12:13,220
Vail has that handled at Vail Sports, which, once again, offers discounts for Epic Passholders.

185
00:12:13,220 --> 00:12:17,580
Visitors also need jackets and pants and goggles and all sorts of non-rentable gear, so they

186
00:12:17,580 --> 00:12:22,060
could head to outposts of recognizable brands like Helly Hansen or Patagonia or the North

187
00:12:22,060 --> 00:12:23,060
Face.

188
00:12:23,060 --> 00:12:27,420
Yet, despite their branding, visitors are once again feeding money to the conglomerate

189
00:12:27,460 --> 00:12:33,740
as these two are Vail-owned and operated franchise stores, part of more than 250 Vail-owned retail

190
00:12:33,740 --> 00:12:35,900
stores around the world.

191
00:12:35,900 --> 00:12:39,740
After that is dinner, which, too, can be accomplished without giving a dollar to anyone but Vail

192
00:12:39,740 --> 00:12:44,060
at restaurants like Margie's House, then drinks at 10th Mountain at the Hythe Hotel.

193
00:12:44,060 --> 00:12:47,980
While skiing the next day, the trend can continue with dining at one of the dozens of Vail-run

194
00:12:47,980 --> 00:12:51,340
on-mountain restaurants, again with a discount for Passholders.

195
00:12:51,340 --> 00:12:55,160
Then, if the day ends and a visitor loves the lifestyle so much that they want to make

196
00:12:55,160 --> 00:12:58,800
it more regular, they could tour property listings with an agent from Sliffer, Smith,

197
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:03,800
and Frampton—the largest real estate broker in the Vail Valley, which, also, is owned

198
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:05,840
by Vail Resorts.

199
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:10,240
While the most extreme example, the reality isn't far off from this.

200
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:14,440
Facing natural pressures from shareholders to grow revenue, Vail is increasingly focused

201
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:17,540
on vertically integrating the visitor experience.

202
00:13:17,540 --> 00:13:20,680
Why should a Vail visitor give money to anyone but Vail itself?

203
00:13:20,680 --> 00:13:25,080
They're developing offerings for almost any transaction a visitor could make, then

204
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:29,860
incentivizing allegiance to the Epic system by offering a slew of discounts.

205
00:13:29,860 --> 00:13:34,680
In the process, Vail is competing against local businesses—they're eliminating one

206
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:39,280
of the few opportunities for local success to be tied to their success.

207
00:13:39,280 --> 00:13:45,880
What's left is the financial impossibility of minimum wage work in the Vail Valley.

208
00:13:45,880 --> 00:13:50,520
There are no easy answers to where a Vail employee might start their day.

209
00:13:50,520 --> 00:13:55,040
The conglomerate's new minimum wage is $20 an hour, a near fortune compared to minimum

210
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:59,360
wage at most entry-level jobs in America, but most entry-level jobs aren't located

211
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:04,400
here, in a narrow mountain valley bounded by two often impassable sections of highway

212
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:07,920
boasting some of the highest living costs in the world.

213
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:13,320
Currently, the cheapest publicly listed apartment for rent within Vail city limits is going

214
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:16,520
for $2,500 a month.

215
00:14:16,520 --> 00:14:20,280
Assuming 40 hours per week of work, which might come if the slopes are busy and the

216
00:14:20,280 --> 00:14:25,120
snow is abundant, a given lift operator might make $3,200 a month.

217
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:30,060
Therefore, after tax, they might make ever so slightly more than what it costs to keep

218
00:14:30,060 --> 00:14:32,640
an apartment in the town in which they work.

219
00:14:32,640 --> 00:14:37,080
But of course, in a small-town environment like this, and considering the competitiveness

220
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:41,240
of housing, most rentals never make it beyond the classifieds.

221
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:46,880
Here one can find deals like this $1,150 a month room in an apartment in Edwards, a

222
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:53,280
20 minute drive away, assuming one pays for the $425 a year Vail employee parking pass.

223
00:14:53,280 --> 00:14:59,160
This gets closer to the 28% of income financial experts recommend spending on housing.

224
00:14:59,160 --> 00:15:03,760
To get under that 28%, it's going to require an apartment with roommates somewhere like

225
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:08,960
Eagle or Gypsum, more than 30 miles or 50 kilometers from Vail.

226
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:14,040
Vail Resorts understands this financial impossibility, and their fix is to act as both the employer

227
00:15:14,040 --> 00:15:18,120
and the landlord with their employee housing program, offering hundreds of rooms near the

228
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:21,540
resort for $500 or $600 a month.

229
00:15:21,540 --> 00:15:26,400
These tiny dorm-style accommodations are in tremendous demand, often filling up months

230
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:30,760
before the start of the season, but never accommodating all workers, leaving hundreds

231
00:15:30,760 --> 00:15:34,840
to work through the financial impossibility of the free market.

232
00:15:34,840 --> 00:15:38,440
The truth is, these jobs don't need to be sustainable.

233
00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:43,020
Vail doesn't need to offer a living wage to fill its rosters.

234
00:15:43,020 --> 00:15:47,120
The pure prospect of being able to live in the mountains is attractive enough to incentivize

235
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:51,760
plenty of financially flexible young people into working a season or two on the slopes,

236
00:15:51,760 --> 00:15:54,480
even if they might not make more than they spend.

237
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:56,160
Vail knows this.

238
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:59,320
Vail's mission statement even implies this.

239
00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:03,280
It reads, quote, our mission is simple, to create the experience of a lifetime for our

240
00:16:03,280 --> 00:16:08,660
employees, so they can, in turn, provide exceptional experiences for our guests.

241
00:16:08,660 --> 00:16:13,840
Creating a job so rewarding people are willing to effectively pay to do it is no crime, but

242
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:18,620
what it does mean is that Vail's money doesn't stay in the Vail Valley.

243
00:16:18,620 --> 00:16:23,320
It primarily goes to a transient, short-term labor pool that'll be gone come spring,

244
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:26,860
never integrating with the long-term local community.

245
00:16:26,860 --> 00:16:31,520
Of course, there are some resort jobs that require more specialized skills and pay more,

246
00:16:31,520 --> 00:16:32,720
but not many.

247
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:37,040
Ski Patrol, for example, is a dangerous job that requires skills that take years to learn,

248
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:41,680
so it's a role typically filled by careerists rather than transient seasonal workers, but

249
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:48,000
in Vail's case, that only justifies a $21 minimum wage—a menial bump over the resort-wide

250
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
$20 minimum.

251
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,880
But Vail's a big business, right?

252
00:16:51,880 --> 00:16:55,600
It's a publicly traded company on the New York Stock Exchange.

253
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:59,720
Surely it must have HR and marketing and vice presidents and executives and all the higher-paying

254
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:03,120
jobs that make for more sustainable urban economies, right?

255
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:07,560
Well, yes, Vail does have that, just not in Vail.

256
00:17:07,560 --> 00:17:12,480
In 2006, the conglomerate moved about 100 of its administrative positions two hours

257
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:15,800
down the road to an office park outside Denver.

258
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:20,120
Because of the living costs that Vail itself pushed up, it was simply cheaper for Vail

259
00:17:20,120 --> 00:17:23,380
to run Vail away from Vail.

260
00:17:23,380 --> 00:17:27,580
Through time, with each resort it gobbled up, it slowly cut local management positions

261
00:17:27,580 --> 00:17:32,140
and aggregated administrative tasks in this Denver headquarters, meaning the resorts themselves

262
00:17:32,140 --> 00:17:38,060
were left with few jobs outside mountain operations, hospitality, and retail—the lowest paying,

263
00:17:38,060 --> 00:17:39,900
least sustainable positions.

264
00:17:39,900 --> 00:17:44,880
Therefore, in sum, what happens when Vail buys a resort is simple—income potential

265
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:49,920
lowers as jobs get slashed and cost-of-living rockets skyward as the volume of visitors

266
00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:52,180
and therefore demand does too.

267
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:58,440
Now, Vail itself, the resort from which the conglomerate was born, was never truly a town.

268
00:17:58,440 --> 00:18:02,960
It was a development from day one, so, at least within city limits, the argument can

269
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:08,000
be made that nobody's been displaced—there's no history of habitation before the lifts

270
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,000
started spinning.

271
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,720
But this is not the case everywhere.

272
00:18:11,720 --> 00:18:17,520
60 miles or 100 kilometers away, in the tiny, idyllic town of Crested Butte, the Facebook

273
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:22,620
comments on the 2018 announcement of Vail's purchase of the local resort read like those

274
00:18:22,620 --> 00:18:24,240
of an obituary.

275
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:28,620
This was a ski resort that ran a marketing campaign titled This Is Not Vail and a locale

276
00:18:28,620 --> 00:18:33,820
referred to as the Last Great Colorado Ski Town, noted for its increasingly unique blend

277
00:18:33,820 --> 00:18:37,020
of affordability, remoteness, and skiing prowess.

278
00:18:37,020 --> 00:18:42,340
Now, this tenuous balance was going to get disrupted by the world's largest skiing

279
00:18:42,340 --> 00:18:47,340
conglomerate, and it was absolutely disrupted.

280
00:18:47,340 --> 00:18:50,880
Whereas in the month of Vail's announcement, the average sales price of a single-family

281
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:57,600
home in Crested Butte sat at $762,000, today, less than five years on, it skyrocketed to

282
00:18:57,600 --> 00:19:00,220
over 1.2 million.

283
00:19:00,220 --> 00:19:04,400
The same, all-too-predictable story played out once again.

284
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:09,260
Big tracts of open land were split up, sold off, and converted into five, ten, or fifteen

285
00:19:09,260 --> 00:19:10,880
million dollar ranches.

286
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:15,000
Downtown houses previously home to locals working just blocks away were bought up, renovated,

287
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:19,180
and sold as second homes and investment properties to those earning an income in Dallas, Miami,

288
00:19:19,180 --> 00:19:20,180
or New York.

289
00:19:20,180 --> 00:19:23,740
The workforce that kept the town ticking was pushed farther and farther down valley, and

290
00:19:23,740 --> 00:19:28,400
the small city of Gunnison increasingly became the bedroom of decades-long Crested Butte

291
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:29,400
locals.

292
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:34,580
There was a brief moment of homeostasis in the North American ski industry, an era when

293
00:19:34,580 --> 00:19:40,700
it could all coexist, but in today's reality, skiing is simply extractive.

294
00:19:40,700 --> 00:19:44,980
Coastal money comes in and, despite good intentions, it pushes up the cost of living, it crowds

295
00:19:44,980 --> 00:19:49,320
out the locals, and then ultimately, that money doesn't go to the locals it's displacing,

296
00:19:49,320 --> 00:19:51,960
it goes to the shareholders of a conglomerate.

297
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:57,320
But this phenomenon is familiar to these towns, given their histories in mining, logging,

298
00:19:57,320 --> 00:19:59,600
and other resource-based economies.

299
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:04,460
The way their populations could make a living all centered around quite literally extracting

300
00:20:04,460 --> 00:20:06,800
value from the surrounding nature.

301
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:11,780
The story of a struggle between small communities and big mining conglomerates is a tale so

302
00:20:11,780 --> 00:20:14,760
archetypical that it hardly bears repeating.

303
00:20:14,760 --> 00:20:18,340
In fact, the similarities between Crested Butte's history and the plot of the movie

304
00:20:18,340 --> 00:20:24,780
Avatar are so striking that many have pondered if the film was directly inspired by the town.

305
00:20:24,780 --> 00:20:29,300
Skiing was supposed to be the way out, the path forward, a way to have it all, in-come-to-live

306
00:20:29,300 --> 00:20:34,340
in America's most striking nature, coming from an industry far less destructive to that

307
00:20:34,340 --> 00:20:35,340
nature.

308
00:20:35,340 --> 00:20:41,500
But the long-run consequences of this turned out to be the destruction of the towns themselves.

309
00:20:41,500 --> 00:20:45,360
It appears a devil's bargain—you can have the nature and the town, but not the

310
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:46,820
in-come-to-live there.

311
00:20:46,820 --> 00:20:50,200
You can have the town and the in-come, but not the nature to enjoy.

312
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:54,760
Or, as so many of the most pristine slices of the mountains have chosen, you can have

313
00:20:54,760 --> 00:20:59,100
the nature and the in-come, but you cede the town.

314
00:20:59,100 --> 00:21:04,520
Unnatural forces can flex this triangle, can allow for a careful, tenuous balance of the

315
00:21:04,520 --> 00:21:09,720
three factors, but it's tremendously difficult to maintain through the decades.

316
00:21:09,740 --> 00:21:14,740
Therefore, Vale and other conglomerates didn't create this devil's bargain, but rather

317
00:21:14,740 --> 00:21:18,540
their influences made the decisions for the communities.

318
00:21:18,540 --> 00:21:23,260
Small, delicate towns were forced into option number three.

319
00:21:23,260 --> 00:21:28,540
They'd have jobs, more than they could possibly need or even want, and they'd have nature,

320
00:21:28,540 --> 00:21:32,060
even if it'd be stressed to its limits by an influx of past holding visitors, but they'd

321
00:21:32,060 --> 00:21:35,620
no longer have affordable access to their own town.

322
00:21:35,620 --> 00:21:39,220
It's a tricky thing, housing affordability.

323
00:21:39,220 --> 00:21:43,320
Even the largest cities, states, and even countries have repeatedly failed to stop the

324
00:21:43,320 --> 00:21:48,180
savage economic forces that break the careful balance of income and cost, so the issue is

325
00:21:48,180 --> 00:21:51,000
certainly not unique to ski towns.

326
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:56,200
The primary difference is that they're phenomenally more vulnerable to outside forces.

327
00:21:56,200 --> 00:22:01,580
These towns are truly tiny—Aspen, Telluride, and Breckenridge combined have a full-time

328
00:22:01,580 --> 00:22:07,400
population smaller than innumerable American towns whose names you'll never even hear,

329
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:08,680
let alone know.

330
00:22:08,940 --> 00:22:14,360
Therefore, one small outside action, one boardroom decision to sign on the dotted line and sail

331
00:22:14,360 --> 00:22:19,360
to the highest bidder, has the potential to fundamentally alter and fracture an entire

332
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:20,360
community.

333
00:22:20,360 --> 00:22:24,620
But this might just be the tragic trade-off of small-town life.

334
00:22:24,620 --> 00:22:29,580
It's the story of the local factory getting automated, the story of the mine closing up

335
00:22:29,580 --> 00:22:35,280
shop, the new interstate shortcutting the old highway, the railroad stopping service.

336
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:39,960
Both places are vulnerable, and while this doesn't necessarily need to be the conclusion

337
00:22:39,960 --> 00:22:45,220
of life in these mountain communities, it does seem an inevitable step in their perpetual

338
00:22:45,220 --> 00:22:46,220
evolution.

339
00:22:46,220 --> 00:22:51,280
If there's one thing the uninitiated might have noticed in this video, it's that skiing

340
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:54,200
is unbelievably expensive.

341
00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:58,560
Why does it cost each visitor one or two thousand dollars to get access to land that is actually

342
00:22:58,560 --> 00:23:01,920
government-owned, covered in snow, that falls naturally?

343
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:06,960
Well, the truth is that making those slopes actually safely ski-able, and more so enjoyable

344
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:11,280
for thousands or even millions of people, is a tremendous amount of work.

345
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:15,920
There are an unbelievable number of daily, monthly, and yearly steps involved just to

346
00:23:15,920 --> 00:23:20,480
allow for those seven or eight hours a day of skiing, and we wanted to dive deeper into

347
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:23,800
them—far deeper than we could in this already long video.

348
00:23:23,800 --> 00:23:29,600
That's why I'm extremely excited to announce our brand new Nebula original series called

349
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:32,040
the Logistics of X.

350
00:23:32,040 --> 00:23:35,600
Every few Wendover videos, if there's some sort of underlying logistics to their topic

351
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:39,160
worth exploring, we're going to dive deeper into it on Nebula.

352
00:23:39,160 --> 00:23:43,400
And these are not low-effort companion videos—we produce these the exact same way we produce

353
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:48,120
Wendover videos, with the exact same budget, effort, everything, so they're just as good,

354
00:23:48,120 --> 00:23:49,120
if not better.

355
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:52,840
And the first one, the Logistics of Ski Resorts, is up now.

356
00:23:52,840 --> 00:23:56,780
I think it came together really nicely, with stunning 3D visuals and some really interesting

357
00:23:56,780 --> 00:24:00,520
deep dives into things like the mad rush to install a lift in the few summer months

358
00:24:00,520 --> 00:24:04,320
when the ground is snow-free, how you manage the snow to prevent a deadly avalanche, and

359
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:07,980
also the incredible overnight process of grooming the slopes to make them accessible to beginner

360
00:24:07,980 --> 00:24:08,980
skiers.

361
00:24:08,980 --> 00:24:13,040
Basically, we know you all love our logistics videos and we want to make even more of them,

362
00:24:13,040 --> 00:24:16,380
getting even more into the nitty-gritty, and this series is the way.

363
00:24:16,380 --> 00:24:19,740
And the reason we're able to do this is thanks to Nebula—for those of you who don't

364
00:24:19,740 --> 00:24:24,100
know, Nebula is a creator-run streaming service that I co-founded in 2019 that now has over

365
00:24:24,100 --> 00:24:26,460
650,000 paying subscribers.

366
00:24:26,460 --> 00:24:30,300
And these are not subscriptions that people forgot to cancel—we have one of the highest

367
00:24:30,300 --> 00:24:34,660
proportions of daily active users in the industry because creators are able to use the unique

368
00:24:34,660 --> 00:24:37,820
economic model to do stuff they can't on YouTube.

369
00:24:37,820 --> 00:24:41,740
Some channels, like Jetlag the Game release episodes early, others, like RealLifeLaura

370
00:24:41,740 --> 00:24:45,140
and NowWendover, make series allowing you to dive deeper on the topics you watch on

371
00:24:45,140 --> 00:24:49,920
YouTube, others still, like Patrick Willems or Abigail Thorne, make huge, ambitious dream

372
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:54,060
projects with the bigger budgets that Nebula is able to offer, but in addition to all of

373
00:24:54,060 --> 00:24:58,260
that, all creators release their normal videos ad- and sponsorship-free.

374
00:24:58,260 --> 00:25:02,860
Nebula is not really designed to be a replacement to YouTube, but rather an expansion pack.

375
00:25:02,860 --> 00:25:06,880
There are limitations of the algorithmic-driven, ad-supported video model, so Nebula is able

376
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:11,180
to offer a creative ecosystem that unlocks more and therefore is a better experience

377
00:25:11,180 --> 00:25:13,620
for the creator and you, the viewer.

378
00:25:13,620 --> 00:25:18,120
When you sign up at our link, nebula.tv slash wendover, we actually get a portion of your

379
00:25:18,120 --> 00:25:22,620
subscription fee for as long as you stay subscribed, which gives us predictable, stable monthly

380
00:25:22,620 --> 00:25:27,180
income, not impacted by the shift in ad rates, that allows us to confidently reinvest in

381
00:25:27,180 --> 00:25:28,180
the channel.

382
00:25:28,180 --> 00:25:31,460
Tens of thousands of Wendover viewers have already signed up, and the vast majority are

383
00:25:31,460 --> 00:25:34,580
still subscribed so clearly they find it worth it.

384
00:25:34,580 --> 00:25:38,380
So if you want to watch the logistics of ski resorts, the future episodes we add to that
