00:00.000 --> 00:08.400
So this topic probably doesn't sound very interesting, but I promise it's at least

00:08.400 --> 00:09.800
somewhat interesting.

00:09.800 --> 00:13.280
Keep in mind that everything I'm saying here is about the most efficient and profitable

00:13.280 --> 00:17.240
design of grocery stores so don't go complaining if your neighborhood Tesco or Safeway isn't

00:17.240 --> 00:18.440
exactly the same.

00:18.440 --> 00:21.720
But chances are the next time you go to a grocery store you'll notice at least some

00:21.720 --> 00:23.520
of these principles at work.

00:23.520 --> 00:27.720
Let's start with the entrance to the grocery store.

00:27.720 --> 00:31.800
Americans in particular love shopping in a counter-clockwise path.

00:31.800 --> 00:35.960
For this reason, the door to the grocery store will typically be on the right hand side in

00:35.960 --> 00:39.660
the United States and the checkout counters will be on the left.

00:39.660 --> 00:42.040
In the UK, it's often the opposite.

00:42.040 --> 00:46.240
For this reason, researchers speculate that this tendency to move in one direction is

00:46.240 --> 00:50.260
linked to the side of the road that the two demographics drive on.

00:50.260 --> 00:53.560
This tendency actually works in the store's favor as well.

00:53.560 --> 00:57.080
Research shows that profits are higher in US grocery stores with an entrance to the

00:57.080 --> 00:58.080
right.

00:58.080 --> 01:02.200
It allows individuals to move in the path that they like and also exposes shoppers to

01:02.200 --> 01:04.880
the most amount of merchandise possible.

01:04.880 --> 01:09.840
In fact, Americans spend on average $2 more per trip when they move through the grocery

01:09.840 --> 01:12.080
store in a counter-clockwise pattern.

01:12.080 --> 01:16.300
This may not seem like much, but when considering that every American goes to the grocery store

01:16.300 --> 01:22.220
an average of 1.5 times per week or 78 times a year, this amounts to enormous differences

01:22.220 --> 01:23.940
in profits.

01:23.940 --> 01:27.500
The periphery of a grocery store is also very calculated.

01:27.500 --> 01:31.700
Items that are almost always purchased in a trip to the grocery store, milk, meat, and

01:31.700 --> 01:35.620
eggs, are spread out around the perimeter to force the shopper to be exposed to the

01:35.620 --> 01:38.480
most merchandise possible.

01:38.480 --> 01:42.060
Shoppers will almost always need to go to these sections, so the position of the milk,

01:42.060 --> 01:46.620
meat, and eggs dictates the way that a shopper can move through the store.

01:46.620 --> 01:51.320
Within the center aisles, some retailers will put the most sold items in the center of the

01:51.320 --> 01:55.960
aisles to force the shoppers to walk by even more merchandise.

01:55.960 --> 02:01.240
Looking at the cereal section, we can see the principle of eye level is buy level.

02:01.240 --> 02:06.040
In the ideal circumstance, the most profitable cereals are put at eye level.

02:06.040 --> 02:11.180
This often means that large brand name cereals are put in these middle shells.

02:11.180 --> 02:15.880
At kids eye level, retailers will often put the sugary kind of cereal that kids will pester

02:15.880 --> 02:17.680
their parents for.

02:17.680 --> 02:22.360
Often on the bottom levels are the bulk price or generic brand cereals.

02:22.360 --> 02:25.800
Those who are being frivolous are usually willing to look around for the best deals

02:25.800 --> 02:28.680
and often have clear intent to buy the product ahead of time.

02:28.680 --> 02:33.520
It's much more likely that individuals will impulsively buy brand name cereal than bulk

02:33.520 --> 02:35.680
sized generic cereal.

02:35.680 --> 02:39.840
On the top level is usually the healthy or small brand cereal.

02:39.840 --> 02:44.160
Usually those who are buying healthy cereal have clear intent to buy that cereal and profits

02:44.160 --> 02:47.080
are often lower on these cereals.

02:47.160 --> 02:51.560
Also a prime location for items that retailers want to push is the end caps or the end of

02:51.560 --> 02:53.000
aisles.

02:53.000 --> 02:56.920
Almost all shoppers will pass these end caps because of the perimeter pattern we discussed

02:56.920 --> 02:57.920
earlier.

02:57.920 --> 03:03.080
Interestingly, the liquor store monopoly in Sweden uses this principle in reverse.

03:03.080 --> 03:07.240
The monopoly was created by the government to promote moderation in alcohol consumption

03:07.240 --> 03:13.560
so one of the things they do to prevent impulse purchases is not have any end cap displays.

03:13.560 --> 03:17.960
So that's all the ways that the layout of grocery stores is designed to manipulate you.

03:17.960 --> 03:21.000
Next time you go to the grocery store look out for some of these retail principles and

03:21.000 --> 03:23.000
I'm sure you'll spot at least some of them.
