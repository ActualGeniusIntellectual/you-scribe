1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,400
So this topic probably doesn't sound very interesting, but I promise it's at least

2
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:09,800
somewhat interesting.

3
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:13,280
Keep in mind that everything I'm saying here is about the most efficient and profitable

4
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:17,240
design of grocery stores so don't go complaining if your neighborhood Tesco or Safeway isn't

5
00:00:17,240 --> 00:00:18,440
exactly the same.

6
00:00:18,440 --> 00:00:21,720
But chances are the next time you go to a grocery store you'll notice at least some

7
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:23,520
of these principles at work.

8
00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:27,720
Let's start with the entrance to the grocery store.

9
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:31,800
Americans in particular love shopping in a counter-clockwise path.

10
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:35,960
For this reason, the door to the grocery store will typically be on the right hand side in

11
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:39,660
the United States and the checkout counters will be on the left.

12
00:00:39,660 --> 00:00:42,040
In the UK, it's often the opposite.

13
00:00:42,040 --> 00:00:46,240
For this reason, researchers speculate that this tendency to move in one direction is

14
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:50,260
linked to the side of the road that the two demographics drive on.

15
00:00:50,260 --> 00:00:53,560
This tendency actually works in the store's favor as well.

16
00:00:53,560 --> 00:00:57,080
Research shows that profits are higher in US grocery stores with an entrance to the

17
00:00:57,080 --> 00:00:58,080
right.

18
00:00:58,080 --> 00:01:02,200
It allows individuals to move in the path that they like and also exposes shoppers to

19
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:04,880
the most amount of merchandise possible.

20
00:01:04,880 --> 00:01:09,840
In fact, Americans spend on average $2 more per trip when they move through the grocery

21
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:12,080
store in a counter-clockwise pattern.

22
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:16,300
This may not seem like much, but when considering that every American goes to the grocery store

23
00:01:16,300 --> 00:01:22,220
an average of 1.5 times per week or 78 times a year, this amounts to enormous differences

24
00:01:22,220 --> 00:01:23,940
in profits.

25
00:01:23,940 --> 00:01:27,500
The periphery of a grocery store is also very calculated.

26
00:01:27,500 --> 00:01:31,700
Items that are almost always purchased in a trip to the grocery store, milk, meat, and

27
00:01:31,700 --> 00:01:35,620
eggs, are spread out around the perimeter to force the shopper to be exposed to the

28
00:01:35,620 --> 00:01:38,480
most merchandise possible.

29
00:01:38,480 --> 00:01:42,060
Shoppers will almost always need to go to these sections, so the position of the milk,

30
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:46,620
meat, and eggs dictates the way that a shopper can move through the store.

31
00:01:46,620 --> 00:01:51,320
Within the center aisles, some retailers will put the most sold items in the center of the

32
00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:55,960
aisles to force the shoppers to walk by even more merchandise.

33
00:01:55,960 --> 00:02:01,240
Looking at the cereal section, we can see the principle of eye level is buy level.

34
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:06,040
In the ideal circumstance, the most profitable cereals are put at eye level.

35
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:11,180
This often means that large brand name cereals are put in these middle shells.

36
00:02:11,180 --> 00:02:15,880
At kids eye level, retailers will often put the sugary kind of cereal that kids will pester

37
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:17,680
their parents for.

38
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:22,360
Often on the bottom levels are the bulk price or generic brand cereals.

39
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:25,800
Those who are being frivolous are usually willing to look around for the best deals

40
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:28,680
and often have clear intent to buy the product ahead of time.

41
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:33,520
It's much more likely that individuals will impulsively buy brand name cereal than bulk

42
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:35,680
sized generic cereal.

43
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:39,840
On the top level is usually the healthy or small brand cereal.

44
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:44,160
Usually those who are buying healthy cereal have clear intent to buy that cereal and profits

45
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:47,080
are often lower on these cereals.

46
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:51,560
Also a prime location for items that retailers want to push is the end caps or the end of

47
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:53,000
aisles.

48
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:56,920
Almost all shoppers will pass these end caps because of the perimeter pattern we discussed

49
00:02:56,920 --> 00:02:57,920
earlier.

50
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:03,080
Interestingly, the liquor store monopoly in Sweden uses this principle in reverse.

51
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:07,240
The monopoly was created by the government to promote moderation in alcohol consumption

52
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:13,560
so one of the things they do to prevent impulse purchases is not have any end cap displays.

53
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:17,960
So that's all the ways that the layout of grocery stores is designed to manipulate you.

54
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:21,000
Next time you go to the grocery store look out for some of these retail principles and

55
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
I'm sure you'll spot at least some of them.
