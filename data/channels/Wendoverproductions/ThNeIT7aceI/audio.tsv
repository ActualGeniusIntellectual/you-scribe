0	8400	So this topic probably doesn't sound very interesting, but I promise it's at least
8400	9800	somewhat interesting.
9800	13280	Keep in mind that everything I'm saying here is about the most efficient and profitable
13280	17240	design of grocery stores so don't go complaining if your neighborhood Tesco or Safeway isn't
17240	18440	exactly the same.
18440	21720	But chances are the next time you go to a grocery store you'll notice at least some
21720	23520	of these principles at work.
23520	27720	Let's start with the entrance to the grocery store.
27720	31800	Americans in particular love shopping in a counter-clockwise path.
31800	35960	For this reason, the door to the grocery store will typically be on the right hand side in
35960	39660	the United States and the checkout counters will be on the left.
39660	42040	In the UK, it's often the opposite.
42040	46240	For this reason, researchers speculate that this tendency to move in one direction is
46240	50260	linked to the side of the road that the two demographics drive on.
50260	53560	This tendency actually works in the store's favor as well.
53560	57080	Research shows that profits are higher in US grocery stores with an entrance to the
57080	58080	right.
58080	62200	It allows individuals to move in the path that they like and also exposes shoppers to
62200	64880	the most amount of merchandise possible.
64880	69840	In fact, Americans spend on average $2 more per trip when they move through the grocery
69840	72080	store in a counter-clockwise pattern.
72080	76300	This may not seem like much, but when considering that every American goes to the grocery store
76300	82220	an average of 1.5 times per week or 78 times a year, this amounts to enormous differences
82220	83940	in profits.
83940	87500	The periphery of a grocery store is also very calculated.
87500	91700	Items that are almost always purchased in a trip to the grocery store, milk, meat, and
91700	95620	eggs, are spread out around the perimeter to force the shopper to be exposed to the
95620	98480	most merchandise possible.
98480	102060	Shoppers will almost always need to go to these sections, so the position of the milk,
102060	106620	meat, and eggs dictates the way that a shopper can move through the store.
106620	111320	Within the center aisles, some retailers will put the most sold items in the center of the
111320	115960	aisles to force the shoppers to walk by even more merchandise.
115960	121240	Looking at the cereal section, we can see the principle of eye level is buy level.
121240	126040	In the ideal circumstance, the most profitable cereals are put at eye level.
126040	131180	This often means that large brand name cereals are put in these middle shells.
131180	135880	At kids eye level, retailers will often put the sugary kind of cereal that kids will pester
135880	137680	their parents for.
137680	142360	Often on the bottom levels are the bulk price or generic brand cereals.
142360	145800	Those who are being frivolous are usually willing to look around for the best deals
145800	148680	and often have clear intent to buy the product ahead of time.
148680	153520	It's much more likely that individuals will impulsively buy brand name cereal than bulk
153520	155680	sized generic cereal.
155680	159840	On the top level is usually the healthy or small brand cereal.
159840	164160	Usually those who are buying healthy cereal have clear intent to buy that cereal and profits
164160	167080	are often lower on these cereals.
167160	171560	Also a prime location for items that retailers want to push is the end caps or the end of
171560	173000	aisles.
173000	176920	Almost all shoppers will pass these end caps because of the perimeter pattern we discussed
176920	177920	earlier.
177920	183080	Interestingly, the liquor store monopoly in Sweden uses this principle in reverse.
183080	187240	The monopoly was created by the government to promote moderation in alcohol consumption
187240	193560	so one of the things they do to prevent impulse purchases is not have any end cap displays.
193560	197960	So that's all the ways that the layout of grocery stores is designed to manipulate you.
197960	201000	Next time you go to the grocery store look out for some of these retail principles and
201000	203000	I'm sure you'll spot at least some of them.
