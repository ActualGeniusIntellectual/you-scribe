00:14.100 --> 00:20.580
In the early morning hours of August 22nd, 2021, the Maersk Essek pulled away from birth

00:20.580 --> 00:24.540
402 at the port of Los Angeles, California.

00:24.540 --> 00:29.300
After navigating through the breakwater, the ship made a westward turn, beginning a two-month

00:29.300 --> 00:36.460
17,000 mile, 27,000 kilometer voyage from America to Asia and back.

00:36.460 --> 00:41.600
This is, in the context of today's ocean shipping industry, a rather unremarkable journey

00:41.600 --> 00:44.120
on a rather unremarkable ship.

00:44.120 --> 00:49.940
Just 15 years ago, though, the Maersk Essek would have been truly extraordinary.

00:49.940 --> 00:58.120
You see, the Essek boasts a capacity for 13,092 20-foot containers, or TEU—20-foot equivalent

00:58.120 --> 00:59.120
units.

00:59.120 --> 01:06.040
In 2006, the Zinn Los Angeles entered service with a capacity for 9,600 TEU.

01:06.040 --> 01:10.820
This was heralded with proclamations of a new era for shipping, as the Zinn ranked as

01:10.820 --> 01:14.340
the single largest container ship sailing the oceans.

01:14.340 --> 01:19.760
In summer 2021, though, the EverAce took its maiden journey from Asia to Western Europe

01:19.760 --> 01:28.820
with a capacity for 23,992 TEU—two and a half times more than the largest ship of

01:28.820 --> 01:30.740
a decade and a half ago.

01:30.740 --> 01:35.700
As a point of comparison, that means this one ship could carry every single container

01:35.700 --> 01:41.620
the 100,000-person nation of St. Vincent and the Grenadines received in 2020 at once, and

01:41.620 --> 01:45.380
then add Bermuda's annual container traffic on top of that.

01:45.400 --> 01:50.560
Now, this trend towards larger and larger ships is indicative of another major trend

01:50.560 --> 01:53.360
in the shipping industry—consolidation.

01:53.360 --> 01:58.200
Recognizing the incredible economies of scale in an industry founded on the principles of

01:58.200 --> 02:02.920
economies of scale, the largest container shipping lines recently worked to reap a cost

02:02.920 --> 02:07.880
advantage that their smaller competitors could not, by aggregating a larger quantity of containers

02:07.880 --> 02:09.640
onto fewer ships.

02:09.640 --> 02:15.120
This is both a cause and effect of the fact that in 2000, the top ten shipping lines controlled

02:15.180 --> 02:20.980
51% of the global market, but now they hold 85%.

02:20.980 --> 02:26.100
Bolstered by historically low shipbuilding costs, Maersk, MSC, Evergreen, and others

02:26.100 --> 02:30.940
elected to order these new behemoth ships, rather than buy or renovate used ships, to

02:30.940 --> 02:35.500
operate on their busy Asia to Europe and Asia to Western North America routes.

02:35.500 --> 02:41.980
So a 13,000 TEU behemoth like the Essex, a record breaker in the wrong year, is now but

02:41.980 --> 02:47.840
a rather unremarkable workhorse of a ship, fixed on a regular route from Los Angeles.

02:47.840 --> 02:52.400
After an uneventful ten days traversing the Pacific, the Maersk Essex stopped at its first

02:52.400 --> 02:55.360
port of call—Yokohama, Japan.

02:55.360 --> 02:59.720
The stop lasted eight hours as cranes unloaded containers from the Americas, then loaded

02:59.720 --> 03:02.860
more bound both east and westward.

03:02.860 --> 03:07.840
Soon enough, though, the Essex pulled in its lines, thrust it away from the dock, and carefully

03:07.840 --> 03:11.280
navigated its way out of Tokyo Bay.

03:11.280 --> 03:16.500
Once it reached open water, however, it actually slowed down slightly, for rather strategic

03:16.500 --> 03:17.500
reasons.

03:17.500 --> 03:23.680
You see, in 2008, in the early days of the financial crisis, shipping lines faced a perfect

03:23.680 --> 03:29.780
storm of circumstance—shipping demand was rock bottom and fuel costs were sky high.

03:29.780 --> 03:34.500
The lines had to innovate to survive, and so a working group at Maersk came up with

03:34.500 --> 03:39.420
a stunningly simple proposition—just go slower.

03:39.420 --> 03:44.200
You see, like most vehicles, ships are more efficient at slower speeds, but companies

03:44.200 --> 03:48.840
were always worried that operating a ship over a long distance below its designed cruising

03:48.840 --> 03:53.800
speed could damage its engine—a quick way to squander any fuel savings.

03:53.800 --> 03:59.440
Maersk proved this belief false, though, and so began operating many ships at 14-18 knots,

03:59.440 --> 04:01.200
rather than 22.

04:01.200 --> 04:06.500
This proved financially advantageous—most industry players observed 10-25% fuel savings

04:06.500 --> 04:13.040
on a given journey, and, in time, going slower became standard practice industry-wide.

04:13.040 --> 04:16.840
Of course, when the shipping market's hot, lines will operate at higher speeds, since

04:16.840 --> 04:20.760
they'd rather get cargo to its destination and pick up more containers sooner, but when

04:20.760 --> 04:25.740
it's not, it's a simple way to simultaneously reduce operating costs and remove capacity

04:25.740 --> 04:28.560
from the system when it's not needed.

04:28.560 --> 04:32.480
This is exactly what the Maersk Essig did after leaving Yokohama.

04:32.480 --> 04:36.760
With no need to get to its next destination quickly, it reduced speed all the way down

04:36.760 --> 04:41.100
to 12 knots as it meandered through the East China Sea, which doesn't seem like it'd

04:41.100 --> 04:46.020
be a notable practice, but slow-steaming has been one of the most significant industry

04:46.020 --> 04:49.100
innovations of the 21st century.

04:49.100 --> 04:53.780
Given the slow pace, it took five days for the Essig to arrive at the port of Xiamen,

04:53.780 --> 04:59.380
China, where it sat for some 36 hours as thousands of containers were unloaded.

04:59.380 --> 05:03.780
In the afternoon of September 8th, though, it pushed off once again, ready to venture

05:03.780 --> 05:06.160
deeper into the Far East.

05:06.160 --> 05:10.360
On this stretch of the journey, through the South China Sea, the vessel passed closest

05:10.360 --> 05:14.880
to the country that most of its crew members call home—the Philippines.

05:14.880 --> 05:19.280
You see, with few labor laws regulating who can work on ships sailing in international

05:19.280 --> 05:24.220
waters, it's only natural that cost-conscious shipping lines look for staff from the lowest

05:24.220 --> 05:26.020
cost-of-living countries.

05:26.020 --> 05:29.760
In short, they look for those that they can pay least.

05:29.760 --> 05:34.120
Arising from a mix of culture, tradition, and education, the Philippines has established

05:34.120 --> 05:38.940
itself as the single largest source of maritime labor in the world.

05:38.940 --> 05:44.720
Some 77% of ratings—unlicensed, low-paid junior mariners that assist with some of the

05:44.720 --> 05:48.480
most physically demanding tasks—are from the Philippines.

05:48.480 --> 05:54.080
Overall, the industry, unperturbed by national boundaries, is incredibly international.

05:54.080 --> 05:58.540
A Danish-owned ship will be built in South Korea, registered in Panama, captained by

05:58.540 --> 06:03.340
an American, and crewed by mariners from the Philippines, India, Bulgaria, Russia, and

06:03.340 --> 06:04.660
beyond.

06:04.660 --> 06:10.300
The westernmost point of the Maersk Essex journey was here—the port of Vung Thai,

06:10.300 --> 06:11.300
Vietnam.

06:11.300 --> 06:14.320
It tied up to its dock on September 10th.

06:14.320 --> 06:19.740
These brief port visits offer most crew members some rare moments of continuous free time.

06:19.740 --> 06:23.460
As the cranes handle the work of loading and unloading the ship, the crew is typically

06:23.460 --> 06:27.920
allowed to leave the ship, see the sights, experience some nightlife, so long as they're

06:27.920 --> 06:29.520
back on board in time.

06:29.520 --> 06:33.400
However, because of the border restrictions imposed by many countries in response to the

06:33.400 --> 06:38.640
COVID-19 pandemic, this practice of brief short visits to foreign countries has become

06:38.640 --> 06:44.880
impractical or impossible—further toughening an already difficult style of life.

06:44.880 --> 06:50.460
So after its 44 hours physically, but not practically, in Vietnam, the Essex started

06:50.460 --> 06:54.880
spinning its propeller once again on September 12th, and the crew members went back to an

06:54.880 --> 06:57.680
endless routine on an endless ocean.

06:57.680 --> 07:03.940
Now, some of Vietnam's primary exports include shoes, clothing, and textiles.

07:03.940 --> 07:08.380
These are, typically, not very price-dense products.

07:08.380 --> 07:13.000
For example, a box of cheap shoes takes up a good amount of space, but might only sell

07:13.000 --> 07:15.080
for $20 in the US.

07:15.080 --> 07:20.160
However, the fact that a company can manufacture shoes in Vietnam, ship them across the world

07:20.160 --> 07:26.700
to the US, and still turn a profit on a $20 sale price is indicative of just how unbelievably

07:26.700 --> 07:30.660
inexpensive ocean shipping is on a human level.

07:30.660 --> 07:34.440
Before the tumult that COVID brought to the industry, shipping lines typically charged

07:34.440 --> 07:40.500
about $1,000 to carry a 20-foot container from Asia to the US.

07:40.500 --> 07:45.620
That 20-foot container could hold some 3,500 shoeboxes, meaning the cost to transport a

07:45.620 --> 07:51.960
shoebox 8,000 miles or 13,000 kilometers across the world from a port in Vietnam to

07:51.960 --> 07:56.000
one in California was about 30 cents.

07:56.000 --> 08:01.760
When people talk about ocean shipping enabling globalization, this is what they mean.

08:01.760 --> 08:06.440
The fact that transporting a shoebox quite literally to the other side of the world costs

08:06.440 --> 08:11.800
less than a single McDonald's chicken nugget means that location and distance are hardly

08:11.800 --> 08:15.880
factors in today's world of manufacturing.

08:15.880 --> 08:20.340
The Maersk Essex's next stop was Hong Kong, where it docked at the Kwai Tsing Container

08:20.340 --> 08:24.740
Terminal for 32 hours between September 15th and 16th.

08:24.740 --> 08:30.380
It then took a slow, meandering path around the territory, dropped anchor for 24 hours,

08:30.380 --> 08:35.740
then worked its way into the port of Yanqian, located near the factories of Shenzhen.

08:35.760 --> 08:44.060
Now, with its capacity for 13,092 containers, there are, of course, 13,092 different spots

08:44.060 --> 08:47.040
where a container could go on the Maersk Essex.

08:47.040 --> 08:50.920
Naturally, in practice, it's far from random.

08:50.920 --> 08:56.120
Complex, expensive computer programs crunch a huge variety of factors to spin out the

08:56.120 --> 08:59.140
ideal storage plan for a given journey.

08:59.140 --> 09:01.320
To start with, there's the obvious stuff.

09:01.340 --> 09:05.820
You want, in this journey's case, the containers for Yokohama to be placed on top of those

09:05.820 --> 09:10.260
for shaman, so one doesn't have to unload shaman containers to get to the Yokohama ones

09:10.260 --> 09:11.260
when there.

09:11.260 --> 09:15.460
Then, the program needs to be sure that certain containers are in particular positions.

09:15.460 --> 09:18.940
Refrigerated containers need to be in a spot with a power supply, while those carrying

09:18.940 --> 09:22.900
goods with the potential for leakage, like animal hides, need to be placed in a spot

09:22.900 --> 09:26.100
where they can be easily accessed by the crew while underway.

09:26.100 --> 09:30.540
Meanwhile, other containers must not be in particular spots.

09:30.760 --> 09:34.720
This table displays the regulations for the storage of hazardous materials.

09:34.720 --> 09:39.260
It indicates that items that are dangerous when wet, for example, must be stored at least

09:39.260 --> 09:43.860
6 meters away from radioactive substances, while corrosive materials must be stored in

09:43.860 --> 09:47.820
a completely different compartment of the ship from infectious substances.

09:47.820 --> 09:52.720
On top of these and a multitude of additional factors, the ship has to be roughly balanced

09:52.720 --> 09:59.120
meaning overall, the storage plan is a massive game of 40 Tetris that only a computer can

09:59.120 --> 10:00.120
perfect.

10:00.700 --> 10:05.700
After 52 hours of implementing that plan, the Essex made a quick overnight journey up

10:05.700 --> 10:12.800
the coast to arrive back in shaman, where it made its longest stop yet—56 hours, loading

10:12.800 --> 10:15.220
a final batch of containers.

10:15.220 --> 10:19.500
This was also the last chance for the ship to load up on food and fuel before what would

10:19.500 --> 10:22.780
be by far the longest leg of its journey.

10:22.780 --> 10:28.660
Finally, just before 6 AM on September 24th, loading was complete, and it was time to shuttle

10:28.960 --> 10:32.920
another payload of thousands of containers to North America.

10:32.920 --> 10:38.120
The Maersk Essex passed Taiwan, worked its way through the East China Sea, then threaded

10:38.120 --> 10:41.040
the gap between South Korea and Japan.

10:41.040 --> 10:45.040
After hugging the country's coast, it sailed through the busy bottleneck of the Sugaru

10:45.040 --> 10:49.600
Strait and entered the cool, open waters of the Northern Pacific.

10:49.600 --> 10:54.160
The Essex entered American waters for the first time as it sailed near the Alaskan Aleutian

10:54.160 --> 10:59.240
Islands, but then exited the country's exclusive economic zone as its track started

10:59.240 --> 11:01.100
to trend south.

11:01.100 --> 11:06.540
After nearly two weeks on the move, the ship's path started to parallel the California coast

11:06.540 --> 11:11.580
until the Essex passed the state's Channel Islands and turned east.

11:11.580 --> 11:18.180
On October 6th, it slowed to a stop, dropped anchor, and then just sat.

11:18.180 --> 11:21.020
On October 7th, it did the same.

11:21.200 --> 11:28.140
Nothing more happened on October 8th, 9th, 10th—in fact, for the next 17 days, a longer

11:28.140 --> 11:33.600
stretch than its trans-Pacific journey, the Maersk Essex sat on anchor within sight of

11:33.600 --> 11:38.640
California's largest city, waiting for an open berth.

11:38.640 --> 11:42.220
The time finally came on October 23rd.

11:42.220 --> 11:50.040
After 62 days, the Maersk Essex arrived right back where it started—berth 402 at the port

11:50.040 --> 11:51.220
of Los Angeles.

11:51.220 --> 11:55.860
Now, the Port of Los Angeles is located right next to the Port of Long Beach and, while

11:55.860 --> 11:59.600
the facilities are technically independent from each other, they take advantage of shared

11:59.600 --> 12:02.260
infrastructure like roads and railways.

12:02.260 --> 12:09.080
Combined, the complex handles about 40% of all container cargo coming into the country.

12:09.080 --> 12:15.240
This is because, like most of the industry, ports benefit hugely from economies of scale.

12:15.240 --> 12:19.320
You see, for imports coming from Asia, it rarely makes sense to send ships to the East

12:19.320 --> 12:23.400
Coast, despite that being the side of the country where the majority of the population

12:23.400 --> 12:24.400
lives.

12:24.400 --> 12:28.240
That's because that would require routing through the Panama Canal, whose largest set

12:28.240 --> 12:33.720
of locks can only accommodate ships up to 14,000 TEU—smaller than many new container

12:33.720 --> 12:38.020
ships—and even then, transit fees are well into the hundreds of thousands, getting a

12:38.020 --> 12:42.960
slot can be difficult, and routing via the canal extends journey times significantly.

12:42.960 --> 12:48.200
That's why most Asian imports are offloaded on the West Coast, but the US really only

12:48.200 --> 12:53.720
has five major deepwater container ports on the Pacific—Long Beach, Los Angeles,

12:53.720 --> 12:56.520
Oakland, Tacoma, and Seattle.

12:56.520 --> 13:01.000
Located in by far the largest metro area on the coast, the ports of Long Beach and Los

13:01.000 --> 13:06.680
Angeles have naturally evolved into the busiest as they have the greatest access to labor,

13:06.680 --> 13:08.820
transport, and infrastructure.

13:08.820 --> 13:13.820
These three factors are the most important for ports because, after all, nobody's shipping

13:13.820 --> 13:19.140
things to the Port of Los Angeles, they're shipping things through the Port of Los Angeles.

13:19.140 --> 13:23.980
It's all about getting cargo containers from the ship and on-to-onward transportation

13:23.980 --> 13:26.940
as quickly and efficiently as possible.

13:26.940 --> 13:32.440
Now, the port itself is essentially the landlord to a number of private companies that actually

13:32.440 --> 13:34.840
run each container terminal.

13:34.840 --> 13:40.340
For example, this facility is run by USUN Terminals, this one by Everport Terminal Services,

13:40.340 --> 13:44.720
this one by Phoenix Marine Services, and this one, where the Maersk Essex started and

13:44.720 --> 13:47.540
finished its journey, by APM Terminals.

13:47.540 --> 13:52.320
Now, once the Essex was docked, the first step was to physically remove containers from

13:52.320 --> 13:55.980
the ship, which was accomplished with these massive cranes.

13:55.980 --> 14:00.000
Each typically unloads 30-40 containers per hour onto trucks that move the containers

14:00.000 --> 14:03.420
to a temporary storage location somewhere in the terminal.

14:03.420 --> 14:07.300
Then, there are three possible onward transportation methods.

14:07.960 --> 14:12.000
First, they could be loaded on a smaller ship or barge that moves the containers to a smaller

14:12.000 --> 14:16.200
nearby port, although this is rare in Los Angeles compared to a place like the Pearl

14:16.200 --> 14:22.160
River Delta, where there are plenty more water access population centers and industrial areas.

14:22.160 --> 14:25.520
Second, they could be loaded onto freight trains.

14:25.520 --> 14:31.080
This direct access to railways, the cheapest method of land-based transportation, is, in

14:31.080 --> 14:34.920
fact, a major advantage of the Port of Los Angeles.

14:34.920 --> 14:39.700
By far, the most common method of onward transportation from the Port of Los Angeles

14:39.700 --> 14:42.620
is, however, trucks.

14:42.620 --> 14:46.280
They enter through the terminal's gates, hitch up to a waiting container, then drive

14:46.280 --> 14:51.660
it to its final destination—whether that be on the other side of the city or country.

14:51.660 --> 14:58.900
So, why is it that the Maersk Essex had to wait 17 days just to unload its cargo?

14:58.900 --> 15:01.780
What part of this system is broken?

15:01.800 --> 15:04.800
Well, in short, all of it.

15:04.800 --> 15:09.980
There's no one factor contributing to the Asia-to-North America supply chain slowdown,

15:09.980 --> 15:13.800
but rather, the system is just overloaded.

15:13.800 --> 15:18.600
Most indicators suggest that transpacific shipping demand is up about 25% compared to

15:18.600 --> 15:22.740
the pre-pandemic baseline, which isn't a massive increase, but it's sort of like

15:22.740 --> 15:25.260
congestion on the highway.

15:25.260 --> 15:30.520
Traffic is an exponential problem—when one lane is closed on a busy four-lane highway,

15:30.520 --> 15:33.860
your journey takes more than 25% longer.

15:33.860 --> 15:39.620
Stopping and starting takes time that adds up, and slows the overall flow down exponentially.

15:39.620 --> 15:44.320
This is why ramp meters work—they prevent excess traffic from entering a highway, keeping

15:44.320 --> 15:48.980
it at capacity and flowing freely, so, even if it takes longer to get on the highway,

15:48.980 --> 15:51.740
each person's overall journey time is less.

15:51.740 --> 15:56.980
It's the same situation with ocean shipping—it's a system, with a capacity, so when it's

15:56.980 --> 16:01.780
overloaded by 25%, the slowdown is more than 25%.

16:01.780 --> 16:07.040
Once a container is offloaded, it's placed into a sprawling terminal filled to the brim.

16:07.040 --> 16:10.940
With an increase in traffic, more trucks than usual are waiting in line to get through the

16:10.940 --> 16:15.160
terminal gates to pick up their cargo, which means picking up a container takes longer,

16:15.160 --> 16:18.360
which means a truck can't get back to the terminal as quickly, which means there are

16:18.360 --> 16:22.520
fewer trucks available to pick up containers, which means more and more containers stack

16:22.520 --> 16:24.240
up in the terminal.

16:24.240 --> 16:28.220
With containers leaving the port less quickly, there's less space for new containers, which

16:28.220 --> 16:31.860
means it takes longer to unload ships, which means ships are having to wait longer to get

16:31.860 --> 16:35.680
into the port, which means there's less shipping capacity since journey times are

16:35.680 --> 16:39.980
longer and ships can't get back to Asia to pick up a new load as quickly.

16:39.980 --> 16:44.660
Meanwhile, all the congestion means that terminal operators are restricting or prohibiting shippers

16:44.660 --> 16:48.880
from sending empty containers back to Asia, which means that shippers in Asia are struggling

16:48.880 --> 16:52.660
to find containers to use, which means that they're having to buy new containers, which

16:52.660 --> 16:55.240
pushes up their shipping costs.

16:55.240 --> 16:59.300
And then all this supply chain chaos means that shippers are sending goods earlier, which

16:59.300 --> 17:02.800
increases demand, which furthers the supply chain disruption.

17:02.800 --> 17:10.240
It's not so much a vicious cycle as a vicious web—chaos compounding chaos.

17:10.240 --> 17:15.240
This is what happens when disruption hits an industry designed to be extraordinarily

17:15.240 --> 17:20.280
standardized—a system so reliant on economies of scale that the world's largest economy

17:20.280 --> 17:25.260
has to rely on five interface points with the world's largest manufacturing hub.

17:25.260 --> 17:30.900
It's a perfect system, a system responsible for many of the revolutions of the last century,

17:30.900 --> 17:36.180
but systems reliant on perfection are those most vulnerable to disruption.

17:36.180 --> 17:39.580
For now, though, the cogs keep turning.

17:39.580 --> 17:44.620
The Maersk Essex is out there, somewhere between California and Vietnam, shuttling another

17:44.620 --> 17:49.660
load of containers from continent to continent.

17:49.680 --> 17:54.720
Maybe the most common question I receive is the most obvious one—how do we make these

17:54.720 --> 17:55.720
videos?

17:55.720 --> 17:59.360
I've finally gotten around to answering that by making a video following the process

17:59.360 --> 18:01.880
of making this video from start to finish.

18:01.880 --> 18:06.600
However, I don't really have a natural place to put that on YouTube, so, like all the companion

18:06.600 --> 18:08.800
videos we make, it's on Nebula.

18:08.800 --> 18:13.480
That's because Nebula is the creator-founded and run streaming service with no algorithm,

18:13.480 --> 18:18.100
no ads, just the very best stuff us creators can make, whether it be these quick companion

18:18.100 --> 18:23.360
videos, long-form big-budget Nebula originals, or our regular videos early and ad-free.

18:23.360 --> 18:26.800
Of course, we want as many people to watch this stuff as possible, so we've partnered

18:26.800 --> 18:29.720
with CuriosityStream to make signing up super affordable.

18:29.720 --> 18:34.540
It's less than $15 for an entire year, but signing up there means you also get access

18:34.540 --> 18:39.220
to CuriosityStream too, where you can watch their huge catalog of top-notch non-fiction

18:39.220 --> 18:43.780
shows and documentaries, like this episode of Engineering the Future about how the future

18:43.780 --> 18:48.280
of cargo ships might actually be a technology of the past—wind power.

18:48.280 --> 18:53.560
So, two streaming services you'll actually watch, for a year, for the price you pay for

18:53.560 --> 18:55.860
a month of other services.

18:55.860 --> 18:59.640
That should already be convincing enough, but if not, signing up actually helps make

18:59.640 --> 19:03.720
sure that not only Wendover, but loads of independent creators are able to keep creating

19:03.720 --> 19:06.760
independently with the stable income Nebula provides.

19:06.760 --> 19:11.320
So, to get this deal and watch that exclusive behind-the-scenes video, click the button

19:11.320 --> 19:15.140
