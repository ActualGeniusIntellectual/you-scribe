4
00:00:14,100 --> 00:00:20,580
In the early morning hours of August 22nd, 2021, the Maersk Essek pulled away from birth

5
00:00:20,580 --> 00:00:24,540
402 at the port of Los Angeles, California.

6
00:00:24,540 --> 00:00:29,300
After navigating through the breakwater, the ship made a westward turn, beginning a two-month

7
00:00:29,300 --> 00:00:36,460
17,000 mile, 27,000 kilometer voyage from America to Asia and back.

8
00:00:36,460 --> 00:00:41,600
This is, in the context of today's ocean shipping industry, a rather unremarkable journey

9
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:44,120
on a rather unremarkable ship.

10
00:00:44,120 --> 00:00:49,940
Just 15 years ago, though, the Maersk Essek would have been truly extraordinary.

11
00:00:49,940 --> 00:00:58,120
You see, the Essek boasts a capacity for 13,092 20-foot containers, or TEU—20-foot equivalent

12
00:00:58,120 --> 00:00:59,120
units.

13
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:06,040
In 2006, the Zinn Los Angeles entered service with a capacity for 9,600 TEU.

14
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:10,820
This was heralded with proclamations of a new era for shipping, as the Zinn ranked as

15
00:01:10,820 --> 00:01:14,340
the single largest container ship sailing the oceans.

16
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:19,760
In summer 2021, though, the EverAce took its maiden journey from Asia to Western Europe

17
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:28,820
with a capacity for 23,992 TEU—two and a half times more than the largest ship of

18
00:01:28,820 --> 00:01:30,740
a decade and a half ago.

19
00:01:30,740 --> 00:01:35,700
As a point of comparison, that means this one ship could carry every single container

20
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:41,620
the 100,000-person nation of St. Vincent and the Grenadines received in 2020 at once, and

21
00:01:41,620 --> 00:01:45,380
then add Bermuda's annual container traffic on top of that.

22
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:50,560
Now, this trend towards larger and larger ships is indicative of another major trend

23
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:53,360
in the shipping industry—consolidation.

24
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:58,200
Recognizing the incredible economies of scale in an industry founded on the principles of

25
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:02,920
economies of scale, the largest container shipping lines recently worked to reap a cost

26
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:07,880
advantage that their smaller competitors could not, by aggregating a larger quantity of containers

27
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:09,640
onto fewer ships.

28
00:02:09,640 --> 00:02:15,120
This is both a cause and effect of the fact that in 2000, the top ten shipping lines controlled

29
00:02:15,180 --> 00:02:20,980
51% of the global market, but now they hold 85%.

30
00:02:20,980 --> 00:02:26,100
Bolstered by historically low shipbuilding costs, Maersk, MSC, Evergreen, and others

31
00:02:26,100 --> 00:02:30,940
elected to order these new behemoth ships, rather than buy or renovate used ships, to

32
00:02:30,940 --> 00:02:35,500
operate on their busy Asia to Europe and Asia to Western North America routes.

33
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:41,980
So a 13,000 TEU behemoth like the Essex, a record breaker in the wrong year, is now but

34
00:02:41,980 --> 00:02:47,840
a rather unremarkable workhorse of a ship, fixed on a regular route from Los Angeles.

35
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:52,400
After an uneventful ten days traversing the Pacific, the Maersk Essex stopped at its first

36
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:55,360
port of call—Yokohama, Japan.

37
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:59,720
The stop lasted eight hours as cranes unloaded containers from the Americas, then loaded

38
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:02,860
more bound both east and westward.

39
00:03:02,860 --> 00:03:07,840
Soon enough, though, the Essex pulled in its lines, thrust it away from the dock, and carefully

40
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:11,280
navigated its way out of Tokyo Bay.

41
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:16,500
Once it reached open water, however, it actually slowed down slightly, for rather strategic

42
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:17,500
reasons.

43
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:23,680
You see, in 2008, in the early days of the financial crisis, shipping lines faced a perfect

44
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:29,780
storm of circumstance—shipping demand was rock bottom and fuel costs were sky high.

45
00:03:29,780 --> 00:03:34,500
The lines had to innovate to survive, and so a working group at Maersk came up with

46
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:39,420
a stunningly simple proposition—just go slower.

47
00:03:39,420 --> 00:03:44,200
You see, like most vehicles, ships are more efficient at slower speeds, but companies

48
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:48,840
were always worried that operating a ship over a long distance below its designed cruising

49
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:53,800
speed could damage its engine—a quick way to squander any fuel savings.

50
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:59,440
Maersk proved this belief false, though, and so began operating many ships at 14-18 knots,

51
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:01,200
rather than 22.

52
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:06,500
This proved financially advantageous—most industry players observed 10-25% fuel savings

53
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:13,040
on a given journey, and, in time, going slower became standard practice industry-wide.

54
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:16,840
Of course, when the shipping market's hot, lines will operate at higher speeds, since

55
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:20,760
they'd rather get cargo to its destination and pick up more containers sooner, but when

56
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:25,740
it's not, it's a simple way to simultaneously reduce operating costs and remove capacity

57
00:04:25,740 --> 00:04:28,560
from the system when it's not needed.

58
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:32,480
This is exactly what the Maersk Essig did after leaving Yokohama.

59
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:36,760
With no need to get to its next destination quickly, it reduced speed all the way down

60
00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:41,100
to 12 knots as it meandered through the East China Sea, which doesn't seem like it'd

61
00:04:41,100 --> 00:04:46,020
be a notable practice, but slow-steaming has been one of the most significant industry

62
00:04:46,020 --> 00:04:49,100
innovations of the 21st century.

63
00:04:49,100 --> 00:04:53,780
Given the slow pace, it took five days for the Essig to arrive at the port of Xiamen,

64
00:04:53,780 --> 00:04:59,380
China, where it sat for some 36 hours as thousands of containers were unloaded.

65
00:04:59,380 --> 00:05:03,780
In the afternoon of September 8th, though, it pushed off once again, ready to venture

66
00:05:03,780 --> 00:05:06,160
deeper into the Far East.

67
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:10,360
On this stretch of the journey, through the South China Sea, the vessel passed closest

68
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:14,880
to the country that most of its crew members call home—the Philippines.

69
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:19,280
You see, with few labor laws regulating who can work on ships sailing in international

70
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:24,220
waters, it's only natural that cost-conscious shipping lines look for staff from the lowest

71
00:05:24,220 --> 00:05:26,020
cost-of-living countries.

72
00:05:26,020 --> 00:05:29,760
In short, they look for those that they can pay least.

73
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:34,120
Arising from a mix of culture, tradition, and education, the Philippines has established

74
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:38,940
itself as the single largest source of maritime labor in the world.

75
00:05:38,940 --> 00:05:44,720
Some 77% of ratings—unlicensed, low-paid junior mariners that assist with some of the

76
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:48,480
most physically demanding tasks—are from the Philippines.

77
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:54,080
Overall, the industry, unperturbed by national boundaries, is incredibly international.

78
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:58,540
A Danish-owned ship will be built in South Korea, registered in Panama, captained by

79
00:05:58,540 --> 00:06:03,340
an American, and crewed by mariners from the Philippines, India, Bulgaria, Russia, and

80
00:06:03,340 --> 00:06:04,660
beyond.

81
00:06:04,660 --> 00:06:10,300
The westernmost point of the Maersk Essex journey was here—the port of Vung Thai,

82
00:06:10,300 --> 00:06:11,300
Vietnam.

83
00:06:11,300 --> 00:06:14,320
It tied up to its dock on September 10th.

84
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:19,740
These brief port visits offer most crew members some rare moments of continuous free time.

85
00:06:19,740 --> 00:06:23,460
As the cranes handle the work of loading and unloading the ship, the crew is typically

86
00:06:23,460 --> 00:06:27,920
allowed to leave the ship, see the sights, experience some nightlife, so long as they're

87
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:29,520
back on board in time.

88
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:33,400
However, because of the border restrictions imposed by many countries in response to the

89
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:38,640
COVID-19 pandemic, this practice of brief short visits to foreign countries has become

90
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:44,880
impractical or impossible—further toughening an already difficult style of life.

91
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:50,460
So after its 44 hours physically, but not practically, in Vietnam, the Essex started

92
00:06:50,460 --> 00:06:54,880
spinning its propeller once again on September 12th, and the crew members went back to an

93
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:57,680
endless routine on an endless ocean.

94
00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:03,940
Now, some of Vietnam's primary exports include shoes, clothing, and textiles.

95
00:07:03,940 --> 00:07:08,380
These are, typically, not very price-dense products.

96
00:07:08,380 --> 00:07:13,000
For example, a box of cheap shoes takes up a good amount of space, but might only sell

97
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,080
for $20 in the US.

98
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:20,160
However, the fact that a company can manufacture shoes in Vietnam, ship them across the world

99
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:26,700
to the US, and still turn a profit on a $20 sale price is indicative of just how unbelievably

100
00:07:26,700 --> 00:07:30,660
inexpensive ocean shipping is on a human level.

101
00:07:30,660 --> 00:07:34,440
Before the tumult that COVID brought to the industry, shipping lines typically charged

102
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:40,500
about $1,000 to carry a 20-foot container from Asia to the US.

103
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:45,620
That 20-foot container could hold some 3,500 shoeboxes, meaning the cost to transport a

104
00:07:45,620 --> 00:07:51,960
shoebox 8,000 miles or 13,000 kilometers across the world from a port in Vietnam to

105
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:56,000
one in California was about 30 cents.

106
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:01,760
When people talk about ocean shipping enabling globalization, this is what they mean.

107
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:06,440
The fact that transporting a shoebox quite literally to the other side of the world costs

108
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:11,800
less than a single McDonald's chicken nugget means that location and distance are hardly

109
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:15,880
factors in today's world of manufacturing.

110
00:08:15,880 --> 00:08:20,340
The Maersk Essex's next stop was Hong Kong, where it docked at the Kwai Tsing Container

111
00:08:20,340 --> 00:08:24,740
Terminal for 32 hours between September 15th and 16th.

112
00:08:24,740 --> 00:08:30,380
It then took a slow, meandering path around the territory, dropped anchor for 24 hours,

113
00:08:30,380 --> 00:08:35,740
then worked its way into the port of Yanqian, located near the factories of Shenzhen.

114
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:44,060
Now, with its capacity for 13,092 containers, there are, of course, 13,092 different spots

115
00:08:44,060 --> 00:08:47,040
where a container could go on the Maersk Essex.

116
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:50,920
Naturally, in practice, it's far from random.

117
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:56,120
Complex, expensive computer programs crunch a huge variety of factors to spin out the

118
00:08:56,120 --> 00:08:59,140
ideal storage plan for a given journey.

119
00:08:59,140 --> 00:09:01,320
To start with, there's the obvious stuff.

120
00:09:01,340 --> 00:09:05,820
You want, in this journey's case, the containers for Yokohama to be placed on top of those

121
00:09:05,820 --> 00:09:10,260
for shaman, so one doesn't have to unload shaman containers to get to the Yokohama ones

122
00:09:10,260 --> 00:09:11,260
when there.

123
00:09:11,260 --> 00:09:15,460
Then, the program needs to be sure that certain containers are in particular positions.

124
00:09:15,460 --> 00:09:18,940
Refrigerated containers need to be in a spot with a power supply, while those carrying

125
00:09:18,940 --> 00:09:22,900
goods with the potential for leakage, like animal hides, need to be placed in a spot

126
00:09:22,900 --> 00:09:26,100
where they can be easily accessed by the crew while underway.

127
00:09:26,100 --> 00:09:30,540
Meanwhile, other containers must not be in particular spots.

128
00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:34,720
This table displays the regulations for the storage of hazardous materials.

129
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:39,260
It indicates that items that are dangerous when wet, for example, must be stored at least

130
00:09:39,260 --> 00:09:43,860
6 meters away from radioactive substances, while corrosive materials must be stored in

131
00:09:43,860 --> 00:09:47,820
a completely different compartment of the ship from infectious substances.

132
00:09:47,820 --> 00:09:52,720
On top of these and a multitude of additional factors, the ship has to be roughly balanced

133
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:59,120
meaning overall, the storage plan is a massive game of 40 Tetris that only a computer can

134
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:00,120
perfect.

135
00:10:00,700 --> 00:10:05,700
After 52 hours of implementing that plan, the Essex made a quick overnight journey up

136
00:10:05,700 --> 00:10:12,800
the coast to arrive back in shaman, where it made its longest stop yet—56 hours, loading

137
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:15,220
a final batch of containers.

138
00:10:15,220 --> 00:10:19,500
This was also the last chance for the ship to load up on food and fuel before what would

139
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:22,780
be by far the longest leg of its journey.

140
00:10:22,780 --> 00:10:28,660
Finally, just before 6 AM on September 24th, loading was complete, and it was time to shuttle

141
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:32,920
another payload of thousands of containers to North America.

142
00:10:32,920 --> 00:10:38,120
The Maersk Essex passed Taiwan, worked its way through the East China Sea, then threaded

143
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:41,040
the gap between South Korea and Japan.

144
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:45,040
After hugging the country's coast, it sailed through the busy bottleneck of the Sugaru

145
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:49,600
Strait and entered the cool, open waters of the Northern Pacific.

146
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:54,160
The Essex entered American waters for the first time as it sailed near the Alaskan Aleutian

147
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:59,240
Islands, but then exited the country's exclusive economic zone as its track started

148
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:01,100
to trend south.

149
00:11:01,100 --> 00:11:06,540
After nearly two weeks on the move, the ship's path started to parallel the California coast

150
00:11:06,540 --> 00:11:11,580
until the Essex passed the state's Channel Islands and turned east.

151
00:11:11,580 --> 00:11:18,180
On October 6th, it slowed to a stop, dropped anchor, and then just sat.

152
00:11:18,180 --> 00:11:21,020
On October 7th, it did the same.

153
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:28,140
Nothing more happened on October 8th, 9th, 10th—in fact, for the next 17 days, a longer

154
00:11:28,140 --> 00:11:33,600
stretch than its trans-Pacific journey, the Maersk Essex sat on anchor within sight of

155
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:38,640
California's largest city, waiting for an open berth.

156
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:42,220
The time finally came on October 23rd.

157
00:11:42,220 --> 00:11:50,040
After 62 days, the Maersk Essex arrived right back where it started—berth 402 at the port

158
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:51,220
of Los Angeles.

159
00:11:51,220 --> 00:11:55,860
Now, the Port of Los Angeles is located right next to the Port of Long Beach and, while

160
00:11:55,860 --> 00:11:59,600
the facilities are technically independent from each other, they take advantage of shared

161
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:02,260
infrastructure like roads and railways.

162
00:12:02,260 --> 00:12:09,080
Combined, the complex handles about 40% of all container cargo coming into the country.

163
00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:15,240
This is because, like most of the industry, ports benefit hugely from economies of scale.

164
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:19,320
You see, for imports coming from Asia, it rarely makes sense to send ships to the East

165
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:23,400
Coast, despite that being the side of the country where the majority of the population

166
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:24,400
lives.

167
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:28,240
That's because that would require routing through the Panama Canal, whose largest set

168
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:33,720
of locks can only accommodate ships up to 14,000 TEU—smaller than many new container

169
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:38,020
ships—and even then, transit fees are well into the hundreds of thousands, getting a

170
00:12:38,020 --> 00:12:42,960
slot can be difficult, and routing via the canal extends journey times significantly.

171
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:48,200
That's why most Asian imports are offloaded on the West Coast, but the US really only

172
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:53,720
has five major deepwater container ports on the Pacific—Long Beach, Los Angeles,

173
00:12:53,720 --> 00:12:56,520
Oakland, Tacoma, and Seattle.

174
00:12:56,520 --> 00:13:01,000
Located in by far the largest metro area on the coast, the ports of Long Beach and Los

175
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:06,680
Angeles have naturally evolved into the busiest as they have the greatest access to labor,

176
00:13:06,680 --> 00:13:08,820
transport, and infrastructure.

177
00:13:08,820 --> 00:13:13,820
These three factors are the most important for ports because, after all, nobody's shipping

178
00:13:13,820 --> 00:13:19,140
things to the Port of Los Angeles, they're shipping things through the Port of Los Angeles.

179
00:13:19,140 --> 00:13:23,980
It's all about getting cargo containers from the ship and on-to-onward transportation

180
00:13:23,980 --> 00:13:26,940
as quickly and efficiently as possible.

181
00:13:26,940 --> 00:13:32,440
Now, the port itself is essentially the landlord to a number of private companies that actually

182
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:34,840
run each container terminal.

183
00:13:34,840 --> 00:13:40,340
For example, this facility is run by USUN Terminals, this one by Everport Terminal Services,

184
00:13:40,340 --> 00:13:44,720
this one by Phoenix Marine Services, and this one, where the Maersk Essex started and

185
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:47,540
finished its journey, by APM Terminals.

186
00:13:47,540 --> 00:13:52,320
Now, once the Essex was docked, the first step was to physically remove containers from

187
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:55,980
the ship, which was accomplished with these massive cranes.

188
00:13:55,980 --> 00:14:00,000
Each typically unloads 30-40 containers per hour onto trucks that move the containers

189
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:03,420
to a temporary storage location somewhere in the terminal.

190
00:14:03,420 --> 00:14:07,300
Then, there are three possible onward transportation methods.

191
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:12,000
First, they could be loaded on a smaller ship or barge that moves the containers to a smaller

192
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:16,200
nearby port, although this is rare in Los Angeles compared to a place like the Pearl

193
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:22,160
River Delta, where there are plenty more water access population centers and industrial areas.

194
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:25,520
Second, they could be loaded onto freight trains.

195
00:14:25,520 --> 00:14:31,080
This direct access to railways, the cheapest method of land-based transportation, is, in

196
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:34,920
fact, a major advantage of the Port of Los Angeles.

197
00:14:34,920 --> 00:14:39,700
By far, the most common method of onward transportation from the Port of Los Angeles

198
00:14:39,700 --> 00:14:42,620
is, however, trucks.

199
00:14:42,620 --> 00:14:46,280
They enter through the terminal's gates, hitch up to a waiting container, then drive

200
00:14:46,280 --> 00:14:51,660
it to its final destination—whether that be on the other side of the city or country.

201
00:14:51,660 --> 00:14:58,900
So, why is it that the Maersk Essex had to wait 17 days just to unload its cargo?

202
00:14:58,900 --> 00:15:01,780
What part of this system is broken?

203
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:04,800
Well, in short, all of it.

204
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:09,980
There's no one factor contributing to the Asia-to-North America supply chain slowdown,

205
00:15:09,980 --> 00:15:13,800
but rather, the system is just overloaded.

206
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:18,600
Most indicators suggest that transpacific shipping demand is up about 25% compared to

207
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:22,740
the pre-pandemic baseline, which isn't a massive increase, but it's sort of like

208
00:15:22,740 --> 00:15:25,260
congestion on the highway.

209
00:15:25,260 --> 00:15:30,520
Traffic is an exponential problem—when one lane is closed on a busy four-lane highway,

210
00:15:30,520 --> 00:15:33,860
your journey takes more than 25% longer.

211
00:15:33,860 --> 00:15:39,620
Stopping and starting takes time that adds up, and slows the overall flow down exponentially.

212
00:15:39,620 --> 00:15:44,320
This is why ramp meters work—they prevent excess traffic from entering a highway, keeping

213
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:48,980
it at capacity and flowing freely, so, even if it takes longer to get on the highway,

214
00:15:48,980 --> 00:15:51,740
each person's overall journey time is less.

215
00:15:51,740 --> 00:15:56,980
It's the same situation with ocean shipping—it's a system, with a capacity, so when it's

216
00:15:56,980 --> 00:16:01,780
overloaded by 25%, the slowdown is more than 25%.

217
00:16:01,780 --> 00:16:07,040
Once a container is offloaded, it's placed into a sprawling terminal filled to the brim.

218
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:10,940
With an increase in traffic, more trucks than usual are waiting in line to get through the

219
00:16:10,940 --> 00:16:15,160
terminal gates to pick up their cargo, which means picking up a container takes longer,

220
00:16:15,160 --> 00:16:18,360
which means a truck can't get back to the terminal as quickly, which means there are

221
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:22,520
fewer trucks available to pick up containers, which means more and more containers stack

222
00:16:22,520 --> 00:16:24,240
up in the terminal.

223
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:28,220
With containers leaving the port less quickly, there's less space for new containers, which

224
00:16:28,220 --> 00:16:31,860
means it takes longer to unload ships, which means ships are having to wait longer to get

225
00:16:31,860 --> 00:16:35,680
into the port, which means there's less shipping capacity since journey times are

226
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:39,980
longer and ships can't get back to Asia to pick up a new load as quickly.

227
00:16:39,980 --> 00:16:44,660
Meanwhile, all the congestion means that terminal operators are restricting or prohibiting shippers

228
00:16:44,660 --> 00:16:48,880
from sending empty containers back to Asia, which means that shippers in Asia are struggling

229
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:52,660
to find containers to use, which means that they're having to buy new containers, which

230
00:16:52,660 --> 00:16:55,240
pushes up their shipping costs.

231
00:16:55,240 --> 00:16:59,300
And then all this supply chain chaos means that shippers are sending goods earlier, which

232
00:16:59,300 --> 00:17:02,800
increases demand, which furthers the supply chain disruption.

233
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:10,240
It's not so much a vicious cycle as a vicious web—chaos compounding chaos.

234
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:15,240
This is what happens when disruption hits an industry designed to be extraordinarily

235
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:20,280
standardized—a system so reliant on economies of scale that the world's largest economy

236
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:25,260
has to rely on five interface points with the world's largest manufacturing hub.

237
00:17:25,260 --> 00:17:30,900
It's a perfect system, a system responsible for many of the revolutions of the last century,

238
00:17:30,900 --> 00:17:36,180
but systems reliant on perfection are those most vulnerable to disruption.

239
00:17:36,180 --> 00:17:39,580
For now, though, the cogs keep turning.

240
00:17:39,580 --> 00:17:44,620
The Maersk Essex is out there, somewhere between California and Vietnam, shuttling another

241
00:17:44,620 --> 00:17:49,660
load of containers from continent to continent.

242
00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:54,720
Maybe the most common question I receive is the most obvious one—how do we make these

243
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:55,720
videos?

244
00:17:55,720 --> 00:17:59,360
I've finally gotten around to answering that by making a video following the process

245
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:01,880
of making this video from start to finish.

246
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:06,600
However, I don't really have a natural place to put that on YouTube, so, like all the companion

247
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:08,800
videos we make, it's on Nebula.

248
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:13,480
That's because Nebula is the creator-founded and run streaming service with no algorithm,

249
00:18:13,480 --> 00:18:18,100
no ads, just the very best stuff us creators can make, whether it be these quick companion

250
00:18:18,100 --> 00:18:23,360
videos, long-form big-budget Nebula originals, or our regular videos early and ad-free.

251
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:26,800
Of course, we want as many people to watch this stuff as possible, so we've partnered

252
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:29,720
with CuriosityStream to make signing up super affordable.

253
00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:34,540
It's less than $15 for an entire year, but signing up there means you also get access

254
00:18:34,540 --> 00:18:39,220
to CuriosityStream too, where you can watch their huge catalog of top-notch non-fiction

255
00:18:39,220 --> 00:18:43,780
shows and documentaries, like this episode of Engineering the Future about how the future

256
00:18:43,780 --> 00:18:48,280
of cargo ships might actually be a technology of the past—wind power.

257
00:18:48,280 --> 00:18:53,560
So, two streaming services you'll actually watch, for a year, for the price you pay for

258
00:18:53,560 --> 00:18:55,860
a month of other services.

259
00:18:55,860 --> 00:18:59,640
That should already be convincing enough, but if not, signing up actually helps make

260
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:03,720
sure that not only Wendover, but loads of independent creators are able to keep creating

261
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:06,760
independently with the stable income Nebula provides.
