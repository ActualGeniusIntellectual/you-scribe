3660	7140	Watch an exclusive behind-the-scenes video, finally answering the question of how we make
7140	14100	these videos, by signing up for the CuriosityStream-Nebula bundle deal at CuriosityStream.com slash Wendover.
14100	20580	In the early morning hours of August 22nd, 2021, the Maersk Essek pulled away from birth
20580	24540	402 at the port of Los Angeles, California.
24540	29300	After navigating through the breakwater, the ship made a westward turn, beginning a two-month
29300	36460	17,000 mile, 27,000 kilometer voyage from America to Asia and back.
36460	41600	This is, in the context of today's ocean shipping industry, a rather unremarkable journey
41600	44120	on a rather unremarkable ship.
44120	49940	Just 15 years ago, though, the Maersk Essek would have been truly extraordinary.
49940	58120	You see, the Essek boasts a capacity for 13,092 20-foot containers, or TEU—20-foot equivalent
58120	59120	units.
59120	66040	In 2006, the Zinn Los Angeles entered service with a capacity for 9,600 TEU.
66040	70820	This was heralded with proclamations of a new era for shipping, as the Zinn ranked as
70820	74340	the single largest container ship sailing the oceans.
74340	79760	In summer 2021, though, the EverAce took its maiden journey from Asia to Western Europe
79760	88820	with a capacity for 23,992 TEU—two and a half times more than the largest ship of
88820	90740	a decade and a half ago.
90740	95700	As a point of comparison, that means this one ship could carry every single container
95700	101620	the 100,000-person nation of St. Vincent and the Grenadines received in 2020 at once, and
101620	105380	then add Bermuda's annual container traffic on top of that.
105400	110560	Now, this trend towards larger and larger ships is indicative of another major trend
110560	113360	in the shipping industry—consolidation.
113360	118200	Recognizing the incredible economies of scale in an industry founded on the principles of
118200	122920	economies of scale, the largest container shipping lines recently worked to reap a cost
122920	127880	advantage that their smaller competitors could not, by aggregating a larger quantity of containers
127880	129640	onto fewer ships.
129640	135120	This is both a cause and effect of the fact that in 2000, the top ten shipping lines controlled
135180	140980	51% of the global market, but now they hold 85%.
140980	146100	Bolstered by historically low shipbuilding costs, Maersk, MSC, Evergreen, and others
146100	150940	elected to order these new behemoth ships, rather than buy or renovate used ships, to
150940	155500	operate on their busy Asia to Europe and Asia to Western North America routes.
155500	161980	So a 13,000 TEU behemoth like the Essex, a record breaker in the wrong year, is now but
161980	167840	a rather unremarkable workhorse of a ship, fixed on a regular route from Los Angeles.
167840	172400	After an uneventful ten days traversing the Pacific, the Maersk Essex stopped at its first
172400	175360	port of call—Yokohama, Japan.
175360	179720	The stop lasted eight hours as cranes unloaded containers from the Americas, then loaded
179720	182860	more bound both east and westward.
182860	187840	Soon enough, though, the Essex pulled in its lines, thrust it away from the dock, and carefully
187840	191280	navigated its way out of Tokyo Bay.
191280	196500	Once it reached open water, however, it actually slowed down slightly, for rather strategic
196500	197500	reasons.
197500	203680	You see, in 2008, in the early days of the financial crisis, shipping lines faced a perfect
203680	209780	storm of circumstance—shipping demand was rock bottom and fuel costs were sky high.
209780	214500	The lines had to innovate to survive, and so a working group at Maersk came up with
214500	219420	a stunningly simple proposition—just go slower.
219420	224200	You see, like most vehicles, ships are more efficient at slower speeds, but companies
224200	228840	were always worried that operating a ship over a long distance below its designed cruising
228840	233800	speed could damage its engine—a quick way to squander any fuel savings.
233800	239440	Maersk proved this belief false, though, and so began operating many ships at 14-18 knots,
239440	241200	rather than 22.
241200	246500	This proved financially advantageous—most industry players observed 10-25% fuel savings
246500	253040	on a given journey, and, in time, going slower became standard practice industry-wide.
253040	256840	Of course, when the shipping market's hot, lines will operate at higher speeds, since
256840	260760	they'd rather get cargo to its destination and pick up more containers sooner, but when
260760	265740	it's not, it's a simple way to simultaneously reduce operating costs and remove capacity
265740	268560	from the system when it's not needed.
268560	272480	This is exactly what the Maersk Essig did after leaving Yokohama.
272480	276760	With no need to get to its next destination quickly, it reduced speed all the way down
276760	281100	to 12 knots as it meandered through the East China Sea, which doesn't seem like it'd
281100	286020	be a notable practice, but slow-steaming has been one of the most significant industry
286020	289100	innovations of the 21st century.
289100	293780	Given the slow pace, it took five days for the Essig to arrive at the port of Xiamen,
293780	299380	China, where it sat for some 36 hours as thousands of containers were unloaded.
299380	303780	In the afternoon of September 8th, though, it pushed off once again, ready to venture
303780	306160	deeper into the Far East.
306160	310360	On this stretch of the journey, through the South China Sea, the vessel passed closest
310360	314880	to the country that most of its crew members call home—the Philippines.
314880	319280	You see, with few labor laws regulating who can work on ships sailing in international
319280	324220	waters, it's only natural that cost-conscious shipping lines look for staff from the lowest
324220	326020	cost-of-living countries.
326020	329760	In short, they look for those that they can pay least.
329760	334120	Arising from a mix of culture, tradition, and education, the Philippines has established
334120	338940	itself as the single largest source of maritime labor in the world.
338940	344720	Some 77% of ratings—unlicensed, low-paid junior mariners that assist with some of the
344720	348480	most physically demanding tasks—are from the Philippines.
348480	354080	Overall, the industry, unperturbed by national boundaries, is incredibly international.
354080	358540	A Danish-owned ship will be built in South Korea, registered in Panama, captained by
358540	363340	an American, and crewed by mariners from the Philippines, India, Bulgaria, Russia, and
363340	364660	beyond.
364660	370300	The westernmost point of the Maersk Essex journey was here—the port of Vung Thai,
370300	371300	Vietnam.
371300	374320	It tied up to its dock on September 10th.
374320	379740	These brief port visits offer most crew members some rare moments of continuous free time.
379740	383460	As the cranes handle the work of loading and unloading the ship, the crew is typically
383460	387920	allowed to leave the ship, see the sights, experience some nightlife, so long as they're
387920	389520	back on board in time.
389520	393400	However, because of the border restrictions imposed by many countries in response to the
393400	398640	COVID-19 pandemic, this practice of brief short visits to foreign countries has become
398640	404880	impractical or impossible—further toughening an already difficult style of life.
404880	410460	So after its 44 hours physically, but not practically, in Vietnam, the Essex started
410460	414880	spinning its propeller once again on September 12th, and the crew members went back to an
414880	417680	endless routine on an endless ocean.
417680	423940	Now, some of Vietnam's primary exports include shoes, clothing, and textiles.
423940	428380	These are, typically, not very price-dense products.
428380	433000	For example, a box of cheap shoes takes up a good amount of space, but might only sell
433000	435080	for $20 in the US.
435080	440160	However, the fact that a company can manufacture shoes in Vietnam, ship them across the world
440160	446700	to the US, and still turn a profit on a $20 sale price is indicative of just how unbelievably
446700	450660	inexpensive ocean shipping is on a human level.
450660	454440	Before the tumult that COVID brought to the industry, shipping lines typically charged
454440	460500	about $1,000 to carry a 20-foot container from Asia to the US.
460500	465620	That 20-foot container could hold some 3,500 shoeboxes, meaning the cost to transport a
465620	471960	shoebox 8,000 miles or 13,000 kilometers across the world from a port in Vietnam to
471960	476000	one in California was about 30 cents.
476000	481760	When people talk about ocean shipping enabling globalization, this is what they mean.
481760	486440	The fact that transporting a shoebox quite literally to the other side of the world costs
486440	491800	less than a single McDonald's chicken nugget means that location and distance are hardly
491800	495880	factors in today's world of manufacturing.
495880	500340	The Maersk Essex's next stop was Hong Kong, where it docked at the Kwai Tsing Container
500340	504740	Terminal for 32 hours between September 15th and 16th.
504740	510380	It then took a slow, meandering path around the territory, dropped anchor for 24 hours,
510380	515740	then worked its way into the port of Yanqian, located near the factories of Shenzhen.
515760	524060	Now, with its capacity for 13,092 containers, there are, of course, 13,092 different spots
524060	527040	where a container could go on the Maersk Essex.
527040	530920	Naturally, in practice, it's far from random.
530920	536120	Complex, expensive computer programs crunch a huge variety of factors to spin out the
536120	539140	ideal storage plan for a given journey.
539140	541320	To start with, there's the obvious stuff.
541340	545820	You want, in this journey's case, the containers for Yokohama to be placed on top of those
545820	550260	for shaman, so one doesn't have to unload shaman containers to get to the Yokohama ones
550260	551260	when there.
551260	555460	Then, the program needs to be sure that certain containers are in particular positions.
555460	558940	Refrigerated containers need to be in a spot with a power supply, while those carrying
558940	562900	goods with the potential for leakage, like animal hides, need to be placed in a spot
562900	566100	where they can be easily accessed by the crew while underway.
566100	570540	Meanwhile, other containers must not be in particular spots.
570760	574720	This table displays the regulations for the storage of hazardous materials.
574720	579260	It indicates that items that are dangerous when wet, for example, must be stored at least
579260	583860	6 meters away from radioactive substances, while corrosive materials must be stored in
583860	587820	a completely different compartment of the ship from infectious substances.
587820	592720	On top of these and a multitude of additional factors, the ship has to be roughly balanced
592720	599120	meaning overall, the storage plan is a massive game of 40 Tetris that only a computer can
599120	600120	perfect.
600700	605700	After 52 hours of implementing that plan, the Essex made a quick overnight journey up
605700	612800	the coast to arrive back in shaman, where it made its longest stop yet—56 hours, loading
612800	615220	a final batch of containers.
615220	619500	This was also the last chance for the ship to load up on food and fuel before what would
619500	622780	be by far the longest leg of its journey.
622780	628660	Finally, just before 6 AM on September 24th, loading was complete, and it was time to shuttle
628960	632920	another payload of thousands of containers to North America.
632920	638120	The Maersk Essex passed Taiwan, worked its way through the East China Sea, then threaded
638120	641040	the gap between South Korea and Japan.
641040	645040	After hugging the country's coast, it sailed through the busy bottleneck of the Sugaru
645040	649600	Strait and entered the cool, open waters of the Northern Pacific.
649600	654160	The Essex entered American waters for the first time as it sailed near the Alaskan Aleutian
654160	659240	Islands, but then exited the country's exclusive economic zone as its track started
659240	661100	to trend south.
661100	666540	After nearly two weeks on the move, the ship's path started to parallel the California coast
666540	671580	until the Essex passed the state's Channel Islands and turned east.
671580	678180	On October 6th, it slowed to a stop, dropped anchor, and then just sat.
678180	681020	On October 7th, it did the same.
681200	688140	Nothing more happened on October 8th, 9th, 10th—in fact, for the next 17 days, a longer
688140	693600	stretch than its trans-Pacific journey, the Maersk Essex sat on anchor within sight of
693600	698640	California's largest city, waiting for an open berth.
698640	702220	The time finally came on October 23rd.
702220	710040	After 62 days, the Maersk Essex arrived right back where it started—berth 402 at the port
710040	711220	of Los Angeles.
711220	715860	Now, the Port of Los Angeles is located right next to the Port of Long Beach and, while
715860	719600	the facilities are technically independent from each other, they take advantage of shared
719600	722260	infrastructure like roads and railways.
722260	729080	Combined, the complex handles about 40% of all container cargo coming into the country.
729080	735240	This is because, like most of the industry, ports benefit hugely from economies of scale.
735240	739320	You see, for imports coming from Asia, it rarely makes sense to send ships to the East
739320	743400	Coast, despite that being the side of the country where the majority of the population
743400	744400	lives.
744400	748240	That's because that would require routing through the Panama Canal, whose largest set
748240	753720	of locks can only accommodate ships up to 14,000 TEU—smaller than many new container
753720	758020	ships—and even then, transit fees are well into the hundreds of thousands, getting a
758020	762960	slot can be difficult, and routing via the canal extends journey times significantly.
762960	768200	That's why most Asian imports are offloaded on the West Coast, but the US really only
768200	773720	has five major deepwater container ports on the Pacific—Long Beach, Los Angeles,
773720	776520	Oakland, Tacoma, and Seattle.
776520	781000	Located in by far the largest metro area on the coast, the ports of Long Beach and Los
781000	786680	Angeles have naturally evolved into the busiest as they have the greatest access to labor,
786680	788820	transport, and infrastructure.
788820	793820	These three factors are the most important for ports because, after all, nobody's shipping
793820	799140	things to the Port of Los Angeles, they're shipping things through the Port of Los Angeles.
799140	803980	It's all about getting cargo containers from the ship and on-to-onward transportation
803980	806940	as quickly and efficiently as possible.
806940	812440	Now, the port itself is essentially the landlord to a number of private companies that actually
812440	814840	run each container terminal.
814840	820340	For example, this facility is run by USUN Terminals, this one by Everport Terminal Services,
820340	824720	this one by Phoenix Marine Services, and this one, where the Maersk Essex started and
824720	827540	finished its journey, by APM Terminals.
827540	832320	Now, once the Essex was docked, the first step was to physically remove containers from
832320	835980	the ship, which was accomplished with these massive cranes.
835980	840000	Each typically unloads 30-40 containers per hour onto trucks that move the containers
840000	843420	to a temporary storage location somewhere in the terminal.
843420	847300	Then, there are three possible onward transportation methods.
847960	852000	First, they could be loaded on a smaller ship or barge that moves the containers to a smaller
852000	856200	nearby port, although this is rare in Los Angeles compared to a place like the Pearl
856200	862160	River Delta, where there are plenty more water access population centers and industrial areas.
862160	865520	Second, they could be loaded onto freight trains.
865520	871080	This direct access to railways, the cheapest method of land-based transportation, is, in
871080	874920	fact, a major advantage of the Port of Los Angeles.
874920	879700	By far, the most common method of onward transportation from the Port of Los Angeles
879700	882620	is, however, trucks.
882620	886280	They enter through the terminal's gates, hitch up to a waiting container, then drive
886280	891660	it to its final destination—whether that be on the other side of the city or country.
891660	898900	So, why is it that the Maersk Essex had to wait 17 days just to unload its cargo?
898900	901780	What part of this system is broken?
901800	904800	Well, in short, all of it.
904800	909980	There's no one factor contributing to the Asia-to-North America supply chain slowdown,
909980	913800	but rather, the system is just overloaded.
913800	918600	Most indicators suggest that transpacific shipping demand is up about 25% compared to
918600	922740	the pre-pandemic baseline, which isn't a massive increase, but it's sort of like
922740	925260	congestion on the highway.
925260	930520	Traffic is an exponential problem—when one lane is closed on a busy four-lane highway,
930520	933860	your journey takes more than 25% longer.
933860	939620	Stopping and starting takes time that adds up, and slows the overall flow down exponentially.
939620	944320	This is why ramp meters work—they prevent excess traffic from entering a highway, keeping
944320	948980	it at capacity and flowing freely, so, even if it takes longer to get on the highway,
948980	951740	each person's overall journey time is less.
951740	956980	It's the same situation with ocean shipping—it's a system, with a capacity, so when it's
956980	961780	overloaded by 25%, the slowdown is more than 25%.
961780	967040	Once a container is offloaded, it's placed into a sprawling terminal filled to the brim.
967040	970940	With an increase in traffic, more trucks than usual are waiting in line to get through the
970940	975160	terminal gates to pick up their cargo, which means picking up a container takes longer,
975160	978360	which means a truck can't get back to the terminal as quickly, which means there are
978360	982520	fewer trucks available to pick up containers, which means more and more containers stack
982520	984240	up in the terminal.
984240	988220	With containers leaving the port less quickly, there's less space for new containers, which
988220	991860	means it takes longer to unload ships, which means ships are having to wait longer to get
991860	995680	into the port, which means there's less shipping capacity since journey times are
995680	999980	longer and ships can't get back to Asia to pick up a new load as quickly.
999980	1004660	Meanwhile, all the congestion means that terminal operators are restricting or prohibiting shippers
1004660	1008880	from sending empty containers back to Asia, which means that shippers in Asia are struggling
1008880	1012660	to find containers to use, which means that they're having to buy new containers, which
1012660	1015240	pushes up their shipping costs.
1015240	1019300	And then all this supply chain chaos means that shippers are sending goods earlier, which
1019300	1022800	increases demand, which furthers the supply chain disruption.
1022800	1030240	It's not so much a vicious cycle as a vicious web—chaos compounding chaos.
1030240	1035240	This is what happens when disruption hits an industry designed to be extraordinarily
1035240	1040280	standardized—a system so reliant on economies of scale that the world's largest economy
1040280	1045260	has to rely on five interface points with the world's largest manufacturing hub.
1045260	1050900	It's a perfect system, a system responsible for many of the revolutions of the last century,
1050900	1056180	but systems reliant on perfection are those most vulnerable to disruption.
1056180	1059580	For now, though, the cogs keep turning.
1059580	1064620	The Maersk Essex is out there, somewhere between California and Vietnam, shuttling another
1064620	1069660	load of containers from continent to continent.
1069680	1074720	Maybe the most common question I receive is the most obvious one—how do we make these
1074720	1075720	videos?
1075720	1079360	I've finally gotten around to answering that by making a video following the process
1079360	1081880	of making this video from start to finish.
1081880	1086600	However, I don't really have a natural place to put that on YouTube, so, like all the companion
1086600	1088800	videos we make, it's on Nebula.
1088800	1093480	That's because Nebula is the creator-founded and run streaming service with no algorithm,
1093480	1098100	no ads, just the very best stuff us creators can make, whether it be these quick companion
1098100	1103360	videos, long-form big-budget Nebula originals, or our regular videos early and ad-free.
1103360	1106800	Of course, we want as many people to watch this stuff as possible, so we've partnered
1106800	1109720	with CuriosityStream to make signing up super affordable.
1109720	1114540	It's less than $15 for an entire year, but signing up there means you also get access
1114540	1119220	to CuriosityStream too, where you can watch their huge catalog of top-notch non-fiction
1119220	1123780	shows and documentaries, like this episode of Engineering the Future about how the future
1123780	1128280	of cargo ships might actually be a technology of the past—wind power.
1128280	1133560	So, two streaming services you'll actually watch, for a year, for the price you pay for
1133560	1135860	a month of other services.
1135860	1139640	That should already be convincing enough, but if not, signing up actually helps make
1139640	1143720	sure that not only Wendover, but loads of independent creators are able to keep creating
1143720	1146760	independently with the stable income Nebula provides.
1146760	1151320	So, to get this deal and watch that exclusive behind-the-scenes video, click the button
