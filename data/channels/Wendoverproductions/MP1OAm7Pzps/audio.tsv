12040	20400	3,500 miles from Washington, DC, 3,000 miles north of Los Angeles, 750 miles north of Anchorage,
20400	24380	where the ground never melts, where the snow falls mid-summer, where no plants taller than
24380	28600	a few inches grow, where the sun sets for months in the winter and stays up for months
28600	33320	in the summer, lies America's northernmost town—Barrow, Alaska.
33320	38720	Combing through maps, Barrow has always intrigued me and I had two questions—why does it exist
38720	40000	and what is it like?
40000	41160	So I visited it.
41160	44960	Now, asking why Barrow exists might seem like an absurd question.
44960	49240	You could ask the same for Fernley, Nevada or Grafton, Vermont or any other town but
49240	50960	Barrow is a bit unique.
50960	55040	It's not a small town, at least by arctic standards.
55040	60080	Just as many people live in Barrow as in the entire rest of northern Alaska, there's
60080	64520	only one town on earth larger than and further north than Barrow.
64520	69080	Considering Barrow is one of the northernmost communities in the world, the weather is far
69080	70120	from typical.
70120	75120	This clip from 1.45am on May 30th shows just how unique it is.
75120	81440	Just hours before, it was 68 degrees in Los Angeles, 70 in Denver, 93 in DC, and 96 in
81440	85760	Dallas while Americans across the country were having their memorial day barbecues and
85760	91000	here in Barrow, the sun still lit up the landscape and it billowed snow just before two in the
91000	92000	morning.
92000	95520	Snowy weather isn't the least bit unique in the weeks leading up to summer and even
95520	99800	during June, July, and August the ground regularly gets a light dusting.
99800	101640	You can tell it's the arctic.
101640	108420	For 65 days in the summer the sun never sets, then for 65 again in the winter it never rises.
108420	110360	On the ground Barrow is desolate.
110360	115480	It's bounded on one side by the flat arctic tundra and on the other by the often frozen
115480	116480	arctic ocean.
116480	120700	There's little emphasis on aesthetics within the town itself, but there are few sites as
120700	123200	beautiful as the sea ice just off the beach.
123200	128000	There's not a single paved road in Barrow as they would be destroyed each year by the
128000	130860	shifting land as it freezes and melts.
130860	135700	In fact, there aren't even roads connecting Barrow to the outside world—they end just
135700	137680	a couple miles out of town.
137680	141660	That does mean, though, that for all but a few months of the year, there's only one
141660	144440	way in or out—the airplane.
144440	148440	Barrow's airport is quite literally the lifeline of the community.
148440	153320	The entire town relies on planes going in and out to get food in and people out.
153320	158120	Somewhat surprisingly, multiple jet planes fly into Barrow each day from Anchorage.
158120	162360	You could start your day in this small town above the arctic circle and finish in New
162360	163360	York.
163360	168760	With no roads or port, with little exception, every ounce of food flies into Barrow.
168760	174480	There's even a special type of aircraft built almost exclusively to serve small towns
174480	177680	like Barrow—the 737 Combi.
177680	181280	These planes have their front half built like cargo planes and their back half built like
181280	185520	passenger planes to serve communities that are small enough that they can't demand
185520	190400	full-sized cargo airplanes and still need a way to bring passengers in and out.
190400	194260	Interestingly nowadays, however, Barrow can be supplied by boat.
194260	197880	For just a few months of the year, the ice breaks up enough that a barge can come to
197880	202080	shore and bring all the goods to Barrow that won't fit in a plane.
202080	206640	That means that if you need a car or a truck or building materials, you have one shot a
206640	208320	year to order it.
208320	209320	As the mayor says,
209320	215480	The cost of living is very expensive here because a lot of the produce, products are
215480	217880	very expensive because they're thrown in.
217880	219920	Air freight is very expensive.
220440	226200	Three things are incredibly expensive—$15 for this hand sanitizer and $30 for this stain
226200	227200	remover.
227200	232000	Products that need refrigeration and transport such as frozen pizza are also unnaturally
232000	234840	expensive—$17 for this one.
234840	240600	Bulky things demand a premium too—$20 for some toilet paper and $22 for diapers.
240600	246480	The cost of living above the Arctic Circle in Barrow is just extremely high due to its
246480	247700	location.
247700	252620	When visiting such a foreign place, you do sometimes have to remind yourself that you're
252620	255820	still in the same country as Miami, Minneapolis, or Milwaukee.
255820	259440	It's a reminder of just how vast the United States is.
259440	264780	Barrow still has a US post office, a Wells Fargo bank, those American style signs, it's
264780	269500	still an American city even if it's closer to Tokyo and St. Petersburg than it is to
269500	270500	DC.
270500	273140	So, why do people live in Barrow?
273140	278380	Why have 5,000 people chosen to live their lives as close to the North Pole as to their
278380	279780	own state capital?
279780	284700	Well, for many residents, it's been their home for thousands of years.
284700	289580	Barrow is the cultural center of the Inupiat tribe—one of the dozens of native Alaskan
289580	290580	tribes.
290580	294620	There's evidence that the Inupiat people have lived in the same spot as Barrow for
294620	300420	more than 1,500 years making it one of the oldest permanently inhabited settlements in
300420	301420	North America.
301420	306160	That's why over 60% of the residents in the city are Alaskan native, mostly from the
306160	307400	Inupiat tribe.
307400	311740	The answer to why the other 40% is there, as it often is, is oil.
311740	315860	Barrow is the administrative center of the North Slope borough—the equivalent of a
315860	317380	county or region.
317380	323660	The area is larger than the entire United Kingdom yet less than 10,000 people live within
323660	324820	its borders.
324820	329180	Barrow itself doesn't have a significant amount of oil, but nearby Prudhoe Bay has
329180	332340	the single largest oil deposit in North America.
332340	341300	The larger companies that have leases out on the Prudhoe Bay oil fields, they hire people
341300	347300	to fill in positions that are needed within their services.
347300	351320	Some people go from Barrow to Prudhoe Bay to work the drills, but there's also good
351320	355220	work within Barrow as it serves as the home of the borough's government.
355260	359760	The primary employers in the area are the city, borough, state, and federal government
359760	363900	and, in fact, you can make some decent money in Barrow.
363900	371060	The median household income is over $80,000 compared to the US's average of about $55,000.
371060	376340	Of course, when spending $500 a week on groceries is normal this number seems slightly less
376340	380100	impressive, but the city does have real industry.
380100	383660	That of course is a big reason why 5,000 people live here.
383860	386260	It's a completely self-sustaining city.
386260	390900	It's expensive—hugely expensive to live here—but those who do make that choice for
390900	391900	a reason.
391900	396060	Among American cities, Barrow sits center stage watching the world warm.
396060	399940	I think we live through climate change on a daily basis.
399940	405860	Climate change and global climate change has its effects on the North Slope as we see different
405860	412980	effects over time as it occurs depending on the season.
412980	421300	Obviously you could see it in the fall and spring, prolonged seasons, in terms of the
421300	428700	effects of climate change—the thawing, the warmer temperatures, movement of migrations
428700	437380	of animals occurring a little bit more earlier than what they were in the past, so these
437380	441660	are changes that we're continuing with on a daily basis in the Arctic.
441660	446180	Day by day, the oil supplies in the North Slope borough run out and the world is turning
446180	447860	to renewable energy.
447860	451900	The area has a looming threat of its biggest industry moving out.
451900	457660	Many other places in a similar situation such as the UAE or Oman or Norway have attempted
457660	463140	to fill the gap that oil will leave by growing the tourism industry, but, as Mayor Brower
463140	464140	says,
464140	465140	It's very seasonal.
465140	472380	It's only from the spring to the fall, the majority of the tourist season occurs.
472380	479060	There's some interest in developing tourist entrepreneurship into the communities, but
479060	486220	the infrastructure is still lacking—lack of hotels, lack of transportation needs or
486220	492140	tourism business items that's needed to conduct tourism that's not quite developed in a lot
492140	493500	of our villages.
493500	498920	Being Barrow is an adventure, not a vacation, and nobody should come expecting a McDonalds
498920	501620	and Segway tours and super-fast wifi.
501620	506820	The beach of America's northernmost town presents one of the rarest views in the world—thousands
506820	511380	of miles of civilization-free ice, water, and nothingness.
511380	516540	Alaska's license plate may say that the state itself is America's last frontier,
516540	524280	but nowhere feels closer to the end of the earth than Barrow, Alaska.
