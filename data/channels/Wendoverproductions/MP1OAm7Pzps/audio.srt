3
00:00:12,040 --> 00:00:20,400
3,500 miles from Washington, DC, 3,000 miles north of Los Angeles, 750 miles north of Anchorage,

4
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:24,380
where the ground never melts, where the snow falls mid-summer, where no plants taller than

5
00:00:24,380 --> 00:00:28,600
a few inches grow, where the sun sets for months in the winter and stays up for months

6
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:33,320
in the summer, lies America's northernmost town—Barrow, Alaska.

7
00:00:33,320 --> 00:00:38,720
Combing through maps, Barrow has always intrigued me and I had two questions—why does it exist

8
00:00:38,720 --> 00:00:40,000
and what is it like?

9
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,160
So I visited it.

10
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:44,960
Now, asking why Barrow exists might seem like an absurd question.

11
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:49,240
You could ask the same for Fernley, Nevada or Grafton, Vermont or any other town but

12
00:00:49,240 --> 00:00:50,960
Barrow is a bit unique.

13
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:55,040
It's not a small town, at least by arctic standards.

14
00:00:55,040 --> 00:01:00,080
Just as many people live in Barrow as in the entire rest of northern Alaska, there's

15
00:01:00,080 --> 00:01:04,520
only one town on earth larger than and further north than Barrow.

16
00:01:04,520 --> 00:01:09,080
Considering Barrow is one of the northernmost communities in the world, the weather is far

17
00:01:09,080 --> 00:01:10,120
from typical.

18
00:01:10,120 --> 00:01:15,120
This clip from 1.45am on May 30th shows just how unique it is.

19
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:21,440
Just hours before, it was 68 degrees in Los Angeles, 70 in Denver, 93 in DC, and 96 in

20
00:01:21,440 --> 00:01:25,760
Dallas while Americans across the country were having their memorial day barbecues and

21
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:31,000
here in Barrow, the sun still lit up the landscape and it billowed snow just before two in the

22
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,000
morning.

23
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,520
Snowy weather isn't the least bit unique in the weeks leading up to summer and even

24
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:39,800
during June, July, and August the ground regularly gets a light dusting.

25
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:41,640
You can tell it's the arctic.

26
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:48,420
For 65 days in the summer the sun never sets, then for 65 again in the winter it never rises.

27
00:01:48,420 --> 00:01:50,360
On the ground Barrow is desolate.

28
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:55,480
It's bounded on one side by the flat arctic tundra and on the other by the often frozen

29
00:01:55,480 --> 00:01:56,480
arctic ocean.

30
00:01:56,480 --> 00:02:00,700
There's little emphasis on aesthetics within the town itself, but there are few sites as

31
00:02:00,700 --> 00:02:03,200
beautiful as the sea ice just off the beach.

32
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:08,000
There's not a single paved road in Barrow as they would be destroyed each year by the

33
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,860
shifting land as it freezes and melts.

34
00:02:10,860 --> 00:02:15,700
In fact, there aren't even roads connecting Barrow to the outside world—they end just

35
00:02:15,700 --> 00:02:17,680
a couple miles out of town.

36
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:21,660
That does mean, though, that for all but a few months of the year, there's only one

37
00:02:21,660 --> 00:02:24,440
way in or out—the airplane.

38
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:28,440
Barrow's airport is quite literally the lifeline of the community.

39
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:33,320
The entire town relies on planes going in and out to get food in and people out.

40
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:38,120
Somewhat surprisingly, multiple jet planes fly into Barrow each day from Anchorage.

41
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:42,360
You could start your day in this small town above the arctic circle and finish in New

42
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:43,360
York.

43
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:48,760
With no roads or port, with little exception, every ounce of food flies into Barrow.

44
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:54,480
There's even a special type of aircraft built almost exclusively to serve small towns

45
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:57,680
like Barrow—the 737 Combi.

46
00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:01,280
These planes have their front half built like cargo planes and their back half built like

47
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:05,520
passenger planes to serve communities that are small enough that they can't demand

48
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:10,400
full-sized cargo airplanes and still need a way to bring passengers in and out.

49
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:14,260
Interestingly nowadays, however, Barrow can be supplied by boat.

50
00:03:14,260 --> 00:03:17,880
For just a few months of the year, the ice breaks up enough that a barge can come to

51
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:22,080
shore and bring all the goods to Barrow that won't fit in a plane.

52
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:26,640
That means that if you need a car or a truck or building materials, you have one shot a

53
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:28,320
year to order it.

54
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:29,320
As the mayor says,

55
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:35,480
The cost of living is very expensive here because a lot of the produce, products are

56
00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:37,880
very expensive because they're thrown in.

57
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:39,920
Air freight is very expensive.

58
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:46,200
Three things are incredibly expensive—$15 for this hand sanitizer and $30 for this stain

59
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:47,200
remover.

60
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:52,000
Products that need refrigeration and transport such as frozen pizza are also unnaturally

61
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,840
expensive—$17 for this one.

62
00:03:54,840 --> 00:04:00,600
Bulky things demand a premium too—$20 for some toilet paper and $22 for diapers.

63
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:06,480
The cost of living above the Arctic Circle in Barrow is just extremely high due to its

64
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:07,700
location.

65
00:04:07,700 --> 00:04:12,620
When visiting such a foreign place, you do sometimes have to remind yourself that you're

66
00:04:12,620 --> 00:04:15,820
still in the same country as Miami, Minneapolis, or Milwaukee.

67
00:04:15,820 --> 00:04:19,440
It's a reminder of just how vast the United States is.

68
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:24,780
Barrow still has a US post office, a Wells Fargo bank, those American style signs, it's

69
00:04:24,780 --> 00:04:29,500
still an American city even if it's closer to Tokyo and St. Petersburg than it is to

70
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:30,500
DC.

71
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:33,140
So, why do people live in Barrow?

72
00:04:33,140 --> 00:04:38,380
Why have 5,000 people chosen to live their lives as close to the North Pole as to their

73
00:04:38,380 --> 00:04:39,780
own state capital?

74
00:04:39,780 --> 00:04:44,700
Well, for many residents, it's been their home for thousands of years.

75
00:04:44,700 --> 00:04:49,580
Barrow is the cultural center of the Inupiat tribe—one of the dozens of native Alaskan

76
00:04:49,580 --> 00:04:50,580
tribes.

77
00:04:50,580 --> 00:04:54,620
There's evidence that the Inupiat people have lived in the same spot as Barrow for

78
00:04:54,620 --> 00:05:00,420
more than 1,500 years making it one of the oldest permanently inhabited settlements in

79
00:05:00,420 --> 00:05:01,420
North America.

80
00:05:01,420 --> 00:05:06,160
That's why over 60% of the residents in the city are Alaskan native, mostly from the

81
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:07,400
Inupiat tribe.

82
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:11,740
The answer to why the other 40% is there, as it often is, is oil.

83
00:05:11,740 --> 00:05:15,860
Barrow is the administrative center of the North Slope borough—the equivalent of a

84
00:05:15,860 --> 00:05:17,380
county or region.

85
00:05:17,380 --> 00:05:23,660
The area is larger than the entire United Kingdom yet less than 10,000 people live within

86
00:05:23,660 --> 00:05:24,820
its borders.

87
00:05:24,820 --> 00:05:29,180
Barrow itself doesn't have a significant amount of oil, but nearby Prudhoe Bay has

88
00:05:29,180 --> 00:05:32,340
the single largest oil deposit in North America.

89
00:05:32,340 --> 00:05:41,300
The larger companies that have leases out on the Prudhoe Bay oil fields, they hire people

90
00:05:41,300 --> 00:05:47,300
to fill in positions that are needed within their services.

91
00:05:47,300 --> 00:05:51,320
Some people go from Barrow to Prudhoe Bay to work the drills, but there's also good

92
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:55,220
work within Barrow as it serves as the home of the borough's government.

93
00:05:55,260 --> 00:05:59,760
The primary employers in the area are the city, borough, state, and federal government

94
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:03,900
and, in fact, you can make some decent money in Barrow.

95
00:06:03,900 --> 00:06:11,060
The median household income is over $80,000 compared to the US's average of about $55,000.

96
00:06:11,060 --> 00:06:16,340
Of course, when spending $500 a week on groceries is normal this number seems slightly less

97
00:06:16,340 --> 00:06:20,100
impressive, but the city does have real industry.

98
00:06:20,100 --> 00:06:23,660
That of course is a big reason why 5,000 people live here.

99
00:06:23,860 --> 00:06:26,260
It's a completely self-sustaining city.

100
00:06:26,260 --> 00:06:30,900
It's expensive—hugely expensive to live here—but those who do make that choice for

101
00:06:30,900 --> 00:06:31,900
a reason.

102
00:06:31,900 --> 00:06:36,060
Among American cities, Barrow sits center stage watching the world warm.

103
00:06:36,060 --> 00:06:39,940
I think we live through climate change on a daily basis.

104
00:06:39,940 --> 00:06:45,860
Climate change and global climate change has its effects on the North Slope as we see different

105
00:06:45,860 --> 00:06:52,980
effects over time as it occurs depending on the season.

106
00:06:52,980 --> 00:07:01,300
Obviously you could see it in the fall and spring, prolonged seasons, in terms of the

107
00:07:01,300 --> 00:07:08,700
effects of climate change—the thawing, the warmer temperatures, movement of migrations

108
00:07:08,700 --> 00:07:17,380
of animals occurring a little bit more earlier than what they were in the past, so these

109
00:07:17,380 --> 00:07:21,660
are changes that we're continuing with on a daily basis in the Arctic.

110
00:07:21,660 --> 00:07:26,180
Day by day, the oil supplies in the North Slope borough run out and the world is turning

111
00:07:26,180 --> 00:07:27,860
to renewable energy.

112
00:07:27,860 --> 00:07:31,900
The area has a looming threat of its biggest industry moving out.

113
00:07:31,900 --> 00:07:37,660
Many other places in a similar situation such as the UAE or Oman or Norway have attempted

114
00:07:37,660 --> 00:07:43,140
to fill the gap that oil will leave by growing the tourism industry, but, as Mayor Brower

115
00:07:43,140 --> 00:07:44,140
says,

116
00:07:44,140 --> 00:07:45,140
It's very seasonal.

117
00:07:45,140 --> 00:07:52,380
It's only from the spring to the fall, the majority of the tourist season occurs.

118
00:07:52,380 --> 00:07:59,060
There's some interest in developing tourist entrepreneurship into the communities, but

119
00:07:59,060 --> 00:08:06,220
the infrastructure is still lacking—lack of hotels, lack of transportation needs or

120
00:08:06,220 --> 00:08:12,140
tourism business items that's needed to conduct tourism that's not quite developed in a lot

121
00:08:12,140 --> 00:08:13,500
of our villages.

122
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:18,920
Being Barrow is an adventure, not a vacation, and nobody should come expecting a McDonalds

123
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:21,620
and Segway tours and super-fast wifi.

124
00:08:21,620 --> 00:08:26,820
The beach of America's northernmost town presents one of the rarest views in the world—thousands

125
00:08:26,820 --> 00:08:31,380
of miles of civilization-free ice, water, and nothingness.

126
00:08:31,380 --> 00:08:36,540
Alaska's license plate may say that the state itself is America's last frontier,

127
00:08:36,540 --> 00:08:44,280
but nowhere feels closer to the end of the earth than Barrow, Alaska.

128
00:08:44,280 --> 00:08:46,940
This video was made possible by Squarespace.

129
00:08:46,940 --> 00:08:50,140
Squarespace is the number one way to build your website.

130
00:08:50,140 --> 00:08:54,940
They power my Wendover Productions website and the website of my podcast, Showmakers.

131
00:08:54,940 --> 00:08:59,260
Both of these websites were built in less than an hour and look great.

132
00:08:59,260 --> 00:09:04,040
There are few things as important as having a professional web presence for your business,

133
00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:08,400
your YouTube channel, your band, your blog, or whatever you do, so I highly encourage

134
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:11,640
you to check out what Squarespace can do for you.

135
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:15,600
It doesn't have to be anything fancy, but nothing is more professional than giving out

136
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:20,300
a link to your custom website that tells someone about you or what you do.

137
00:09:20,300 --> 00:09:25,740
You can get 10% off your custom website by going to squarespace.com slash wendover.

138
00:09:25,740 --> 00:09:29,880
This project where I traveled literally to the top of the world to film a video would

139
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:34,280
never have been possible without Squarespace's support so I do hope you go at least check

140
00:09:34,280 --> 00:09:38,080
them out over at squarespace.com slash wendover.

141
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:42,980
I traveled to Barrow with the guys behind two channels—Real Life Lore and Second Thought.

142
00:09:42,980 --> 00:09:45,640
You can find their videos on the town here.

143
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:49,320
Please also be sure to check out my podcast Showmakers and subscribe to this channel to

144
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:52,400
get all future videos right when they come out.

145
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:56,320
Thanks again for watching and I'll see you in two weeks for another Wendover Productions

146
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:56,960
video.
