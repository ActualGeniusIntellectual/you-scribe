00:12.040 --> 00:20.400
3,500 miles from Washington, DC, 3,000 miles north of Los Angeles, 750 miles north of Anchorage,

00:20.400 --> 00:24.380
where the ground never melts, where the snow falls mid-summer, where no plants taller than

00:24.380 --> 00:28.600
a few inches grow, where the sun sets for months in the winter and stays up for months

00:28.600 --> 00:33.320
in the summer, lies America's northernmost town—Barrow, Alaska.

00:33.320 --> 00:38.720
Combing through maps, Barrow has always intrigued me and I had two questions—why does it exist

00:38.720 --> 00:40.000
and what is it like?

00:40.000 --> 00:41.160
So I visited it.

00:41.160 --> 00:44.960
Now, asking why Barrow exists might seem like an absurd question.

00:44.960 --> 00:49.240
You could ask the same for Fernley, Nevada or Grafton, Vermont or any other town but

00:49.240 --> 00:50.960
Barrow is a bit unique.

00:50.960 --> 00:55.040
It's not a small town, at least by arctic standards.

00:55.040 --> 01:00.080
Just as many people live in Barrow as in the entire rest of northern Alaska, there's

01:00.080 --> 01:04.520
only one town on earth larger than and further north than Barrow.

01:04.520 --> 01:09.080
Considering Barrow is one of the northernmost communities in the world, the weather is far

01:09.080 --> 01:10.120
from typical.

01:10.120 --> 01:15.120
This clip from 1.45am on May 30th shows just how unique it is.

01:15.120 --> 01:21.440
Just hours before, it was 68 degrees in Los Angeles, 70 in Denver, 93 in DC, and 96 in

01:21.440 --> 01:25.760
Dallas while Americans across the country were having their memorial day barbecues and

01:25.760 --> 01:31.000
here in Barrow, the sun still lit up the landscape and it billowed snow just before two in the

01:31.000 --> 01:32.000
morning.

01:32.000 --> 01:35.520
Snowy weather isn't the least bit unique in the weeks leading up to summer and even

01:35.520 --> 01:39.800
during June, July, and August the ground regularly gets a light dusting.

01:39.800 --> 01:41.640
You can tell it's the arctic.

01:41.640 --> 01:48.420
For 65 days in the summer the sun never sets, then for 65 again in the winter it never rises.

01:48.420 --> 01:50.360
On the ground Barrow is desolate.

01:50.360 --> 01:55.480
It's bounded on one side by the flat arctic tundra and on the other by the often frozen

01:55.480 --> 01:56.480
arctic ocean.

01:56.480 --> 02:00.700
There's little emphasis on aesthetics within the town itself, but there are few sites as

02:00.700 --> 02:03.200
beautiful as the sea ice just off the beach.

02:03.200 --> 02:08.000
There's not a single paved road in Barrow as they would be destroyed each year by the

02:08.000 --> 02:10.860
shifting land as it freezes and melts.

02:10.860 --> 02:15.700
In fact, there aren't even roads connecting Barrow to the outside world—they end just

02:15.700 --> 02:17.680
a couple miles out of town.

02:17.680 --> 02:21.660
That does mean, though, that for all but a few months of the year, there's only one

02:21.660 --> 02:24.440
way in or out—the airplane.

02:24.440 --> 02:28.440
Barrow's airport is quite literally the lifeline of the community.

02:28.440 --> 02:33.320
The entire town relies on planes going in and out to get food in and people out.

02:33.320 --> 02:38.120
Somewhat surprisingly, multiple jet planes fly into Barrow each day from Anchorage.

02:38.120 --> 02:42.360
You could start your day in this small town above the arctic circle and finish in New

02:42.360 --> 02:43.360
York.

02:43.360 --> 02:48.760
With no roads or port, with little exception, every ounce of food flies into Barrow.

02:48.760 --> 02:54.480
There's even a special type of aircraft built almost exclusively to serve small towns

02:54.480 --> 02:57.680
like Barrow—the 737 Combi.

02:57.680 --> 03:01.280
These planes have their front half built like cargo planes and their back half built like

03:01.280 --> 03:05.520
passenger planes to serve communities that are small enough that they can't demand

03:05.520 --> 03:10.400
full-sized cargo airplanes and still need a way to bring passengers in and out.

03:10.400 --> 03:14.260
Interestingly nowadays, however, Barrow can be supplied by boat.

03:14.260 --> 03:17.880
For just a few months of the year, the ice breaks up enough that a barge can come to

03:17.880 --> 03:22.080
shore and bring all the goods to Barrow that won't fit in a plane.

03:22.080 --> 03:26.640
That means that if you need a car or a truck or building materials, you have one shot a

03:26.640 --> 03:28.320
year to order it.

03:28.320 --> 03:29.320
As the mayor says,

03:29.320 --> 03:35.480
The cost of living is very expensive here because a lot of the produce, products are

03:35.480 --> 03:37.880
very expensive because they're thrown in.

03:37.880 --> 03:39.920
Air freight is very expensive.

03:40.440 --> 03:46.200
Three things are incredibly expensive—$15 for this hand sanitizer and $30 for this stain

03:46.200 --> 03:47.200
remover.

03:47.200 --> 03:52.000
Products that need refrigeration and transport such as frozen pizza are also unnaturally

03:52.000 --> 03:54.840
expensive—$17 for this one.

03:54.840 --> 04:00.600
Bulky things demand a premium too—$20 for some toilet paper and $22 for diapers.

04:00.600 --> 04:06.480
The cost of living above the Arctic Circle in Barrow is just extremely high due to its

04:06.480 --> 04:07.700
location.

04:07.700 --> 04:12.620
When visiting such a foreign place, you do sometimes have to remind yourself that you're

04:12.620 --> 04:15.820
still in the same country as Miami, Minneapolis, or Milwaukee.

04:15.820 --> 04:19.440
It's a reminder of just how vast the United States is.

04:19.440 --> 04:24.780
Barrow still has a US post office, a Wells Fargo bank, those American style signs, it's

04:24.780 --> 04:29.500
still an American city even if it's closer to Tokyo and St. Petersburg than it is to

04:29.500 --> 04:30.500
DC.

04:30.500 --> 04:33.140
So, why do people live in Barrow?

04:33.140 --> 04:38.380
Why have 5,000 people chosen to live their lives as close to the North Pole as to their

04:38.380 --> 04:39.780
own state capital?

04:39.780 --> 04:44.700
Well, for many residents, it's been their home for thousands of years.

04:44.700 --> 04:49.580
Barrow is the cultural center of the Inupiat tribe—one of the dozens of native Alaskan

04:49.580 --> 04:50.580
tribes.

04:50.580 --> 04:54.620
There's evidence that the Inupiat people have lived in the same spot as Barrow for

04:54.620 --> 05:00.420
more than 1,500 years making it one of the oldest permanently inhabited settlements in

05:00.420 --> 05:01.420
North America.

05:01.420 --> 05:06.160
That's why over 60% of the residents in the city are Alaskan native, mostly from the

05:06.160 --> 05:07.400
Inupiat tribe.

05:07.400 --> 05:11.740
The answer to why the other 40% is there, as it often is, is oil.

05:11.740 --> 05:15.860
Barrow is the administrative center of the North Slope borough—the equivalent of a

05:15.860 --> 05:17.380
county or region.

05:17.380 --> 05:23.660
The area is larger than the entire United Kingdom yet less than 10,000 people live within

05:23.660 --> 05:24.820
its borders.

05:24.820 --> 05:29.180
Barrow itself doesn't have a significant amount of oil, but nearby Prudhoe Bay has

05:29.180 --> 05:32.340
the single largest oil deposit in North America.

05:32.340 --> 05:41.300
The larger companies that have leases out on the Prudhoe Bay oil fields, they hire people

05:41.300 --> 05:47.300
to fill in positions that are needed within their services.

05:47.300 --> 05:51.320
Some people go from Barrow to Prudhoe Bay to work the drills, but there's also good

05:51.320 --> 05:55.220
work within Barrow as it serves as the home of the borough's government.

05:55.260 --> 05:59.760
The primary employers in the area are the city, borough, state, and federal government

05:59.760 --> 06:03.900
and, in fact, you can make some decent money in Barrow.

06:03.900 --> 06:11.060
The median household income is over $80,000 compared to the US's average of about $55,000.

06:11.060 --> 06:16.340
Of course, when spending $500 a week on groceries is normal this number seems slightly less

06:16.340 --> 06:20.100
impressive, but the city does have real industry.

06:20.100 --> 06:23.660
That of course is a big reason why 5,000 people live here.

06:23.860 --> 06:26.260
It's a completely self-sustaining city.

06:26.260 --> 06:30.900
It's expensive—hugely expensive to live here—but those who do make that choice for

06:30.900 --> 06:31.900
a reason.

06:31.900 --> 06:36.060
Among American cities, Barrow sits center stage watching the world warm.

06:36.060 --> 06:39.940
I think we live through climate change on a daily basis.

06:39.940 --> 06:45.860
Climate change and global climate change has its effects on the North Slope as we see different

06:45.860 --> 06:52.980
effects over time as it occurs depending on the season.

06:52.980 --> 07:01.300
Obviously you could see it in the fall and spring, prolonged seasons, in terms of the

07:01.300 --> 07:08.700
effects of climate change—the thawing, the warmer temperatures, movement of migrations

07:08.700 --> 07:17.380
of animals occurring a little bit more earlier than what they were in the past, so these

07:17.380 --> 07:21.660
are changes that we're continuing with on a daily basis in the Arctic.

07:21.660 --> 07:26.180
Day by day, the oil supplies in the North Slope borough run out and the world is turning

07:26.180 --> 07:27.860
to renewable energy.

07:27.860 --> 07:31.900
The area has a looming threat of its biggest industry moving out.

07:31.900 --> 07:37.660
Many other places in a similar situation such as the UAE or Oman or Norway have attempted

07:37.660 --> 07:43.140
to fill the gap that oil will leave by growing the tourism industry, but, as Mayor Brower

07:43.140 --> 07:44.140
says,

07:44.140 --> 07:45.140
It's very seasonal.

07:45.140 --> 07:52.380
It's only from the spring to the fall, the majority of the tourist season occurs.

07:52.380 --> 07:59.060
There's some interest in developing tourist entrepreneurship into the communities, but

07:59.060 --> 08:06.220
the infrastructure is still lacking—lack of hotels, lack of transportation needs or

08:06.220 --> 08:12.140
tourism business items that's needed to conduct tourism that's not quite developed in a lot

08:12.140 --> 08:13.500
of our villages.

08:13.500 --> 08:18.920
Being Barrow is an adventure, not a vacation, and nobody should come expecting a McDonalds

08:18.920 --> 08:21.620
and Segway tours and super-fast wifi.

08:21.620 --> 08:26.820
The beach of America's northernmost town presents one of the rarest views in the world—thousands

08:26.820 --> 08:31.380
of miles of civilization-free ice, water, and nothingness.

08:31.380 --> 08:36.540
Alaska's license plate may say that the state itself is America's last frontier,

08:36.540 --> 08:44.280
but nowhere feels closer to the end of the earth than Barrow, Alaska.

08:44.280 --> 08:46.940
This video was made possible by Squarespace.

08:46.940 --> 08:50.140
Squarespace is the number one way to build your website.

08:50.140 --> 08:54.940
They power my Wendover Productions website and the website of my podcast, Showmakers.

08:54.940 --> 08:59.260
Both of these websites were built in less than an hour and look great.

08:59.260 --> 09:04.040
There are few things as important as having a professional web presence for your business,

09:04.040 --> 09:08.400
your YouTube channel, your band, your blog, or whatever you do, so I highly encourage

09:08.400 --> 09:11.640
you to check out what Squarespace can do for you.

09:11.640 --> 09:15.600
It doesn't have to be anything fancy, but nothing is more professional than giving out

09:15.600 --> 09:20.300
a link to your custom website that tells someone about you or what you do.

09:20.300 --> 09:25.740
You can get 10% off your custom website by going to squarespace.com slash wendover.

09:25.740 --> 09:29.880
This project where I traveled literally to the top of the world to film a video would

09:29.880 --> 09:34.280
never have been possible without Squarespace's support so I do hope you go at least check

09:34.280 --> 09:38.080
them out over at squarespace.com slash wendover.

09:38.080 --> 09:42.980
I traveled to Barrow with the guys behind two channels—Real Life Lore and Second Thought.

09:42.980 --> 09:45.640
You can find their videos on the town here.

09:45.640 --> 09:49.320
Please also be sure to check out my podcast Showmakers and subscribe to this channel to

09:49.320 --> 09:52.400
get all future videos right when they come out.

09:52.400 --> 09:56.320
Thanks again for watching and I'll see you in two weeks for another Wendover Productions

09:56.320 --> 09:56.960
video.
