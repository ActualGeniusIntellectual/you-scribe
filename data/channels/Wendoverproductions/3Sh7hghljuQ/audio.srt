4
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:15,760
The Wuhan coronavirus began, like all new viruses, with a remarkably ordinary moment.

5
00:00:15,760 --> 00:00:22,680
In late November, 2019, someone—it is not yet known who—ate a wild animal that, by

6
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:27,720
chance, carried the novel coronavirus and days later, started to feel the symptoms of

7
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:30,840
what initially seemed like a bad cold.

8
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:35,500
From there, more individuals were infected—at first through the consumption of other wild

9
00:00:35,500 --> 00:00:38,960
animals, but later through direct human-to-human transmission.

10
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:45,100
For the entire month of December, the virus was there, in Wuhan, spreading, but nobody

11
00:00:45,100 --> 00:00:46,100
knew it.

12
00:00:46,100 --> 00:00:50,480
The cases, presenting as pneumonia, were at first considered to be caused by any one of

13
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:55,240
the countless other viruses that can create such symptoms, but eventually, the escalation

14
00:00:55,240 --> 00:01:00,300
in cases, and the fact that almost all the first patients had bought food at one particular

15
00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:04,900
wild animal market, caught the Wuhan city government's attention.

16
00:01:04,900 --> 00:01:09,280
The first official confirmation that something was up came on New Year's Eve, December

17
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:13,520
31st, when the Municipal Health Commission published a press release acknowledging the

18
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:17,320
situation, over a month after the first transmission.

19
00:01:17,320 --> 00:01:23,120
At the time, this was small local news—only a few dozen cases of pneumonia in a city of

20
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:26,280
millions in a country of a billion.

21
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:30,660
But then came the news that this was not one of the many pre-existing pneumonia-causing

22
00:01:30,660 --> 00:01:32,200
viruses.

23
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:34,760
This was something new.

24
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:39,360
Western media first reported on the novel coronavirus around January 8th.

25
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:43,980
The New York Times, forebodingly, wrote, there is no evidence that the new virus is readily

26
00:01:43,980 --> 00:01:48,400
spread by humans and it has not been tied to any deaths.

27
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:49,880
That would soon change.

28
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:54,480
On January 21st, when the World Health Organization started tracking the outbreak, there were

29
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:56,960
282 cases.

30
00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:59,360
The next day, 314.

31
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:01,480
The next, 581.

32
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:03,920
Then 846.

33
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:06,440
Then 1,320.

34
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:08,560
Then 2,014.

35
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:13,720
And by the start of the week of January 26th, it was clear that this would not be a quick

36
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:15,440
and painless virus.

37
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:18,960
This would be one for the history books, and it was going to get a lot worse before it

38
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:21,280
got any better.

39
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:24,040
Drastic circumstances called for drastic action.

40
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:28,840
It was clear, given the trends, that Wuhan's hospitals would soon be overwhelmed by patients

41
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:34,200
and, in the case of highly infectious viruses like coronavirus, that makes a bad situation

42
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:38,960
worse as infected individuals will try to recover at home, where the virus can more

43
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:40,200
easily spread.

44
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:45,920
Therefore, the decision was made, on January 23rd, to build a brand new facility capable

45
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:50,520
of treating 1,000 patients at once—Woshenshun Hospital.

46
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:56,480
It was announced that this would be done, fully constructed, by February 2nd, just ten

47
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:58,560
days later.

48
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:01,560
China has experience with such a feat.

49
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:07,280
In 2003, the country suffered an outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome, or SARS,

50
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:10,160
which is also caused by a form of coronavirus.

51
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:15,080
Much like with the novel coronavirus, hospitals were overwhelmed and many had to turn away

52
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:16,080
from this.

53
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:19,780
In response, the government decided to build a new hospital.

54
00:03:19,780 --> 00:03:25,100
Over six days, 7,000 construction workers brought the Xiaotongshan Hospital into reality

55
00:03:25,100 --> 00:03:29,560
and it quickly began accepting patients and relieving the overstressed medical system.

56
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:33,800
Once the outbreak settled down, the Xiaotongshan Hospital was hailed as a massive success by

57
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:37,120
both the country itself and the World Health Organization.

58
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:39,200
The statistics speak for themselves.

59
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:42,760
Overall, SARS had a fatality rate of 9.6%.

60
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:49,360
At the Xiaotongshan Hospital, just 1.2% of patients died and not a single staff member

61
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:50,360
was infected.

62
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:55,060
It's no wonder why China wanted to replicate this and therefore Xiaotongshan was the model

63
00:03:55,060 --> 00:03:59,200
for the new coronavirus hospital, but this time would be different.

64
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:04,320
The 2003 hospital began construction over six months after the beginning of the outbreak.

65
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:09,320
The 2020 hospital started construction less than two months after the first case and just

66
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:12,960
days after the seriousness of the outbreak became clear.

67
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:16,020
There was far less time for planning and design.

68
00:04:16,020 --> 00:04:20,180
The orders came and then it was immediately time to start.

69
00:04:20,180 --> 00:04:23,280
Step one was finding a place to put the hospital.

70
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:28,220
The location selected was previously just an open field about 14 miles or 22 kilometers

71
00:04:28,220 --> 00:04:29,680
from central Wuhan.

72
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:34,100
This kept it away from the dense urban core, where further transmission might be easier,

73
00:04:34,100 --> 00:04:39,140
and the field in question was also right off a large pre-existing road which made access

74
00:04:39,140 --> 00:04:40,340
easy.

75
00:04:40,340 --> 00:04:44,740
That road was quickly shut down and turned into, essentially, a parking lot and staging

76
00:04:44,740 --> 00:04:46,240
area for the project.

77
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:50,260
The contract for this project was given to China Construction Third Engineering Bureau

78
00:04:50,260 --> 00:04:55,380
Company—a subsidiary of the state-owned China State Construction Engineering Corporation.

79
00:04:55,380 --> 00:04:59,400
By revenue, this is the world's largest construction company and it has experience

80
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:04,280
in enormous projects like Beijing's new airport, Egypt's new capital city, and Tesla's

81
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:05,780
Shanghai Gigafactory.

82
00:05:05,780 --> 00:05:09,000
If anyone was going to pull this off, it was them.

83
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:13,980
To begin construction in earnest, they first needed to prepare the selected site.

84
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:18,480
That involved, first, cutting down all the trees and shrubbery and then perfectly levelling

85
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:19,680
the ground.

86
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:25,440
Out of the 10-day construction timeline, this took longer than one might think—about 48

87
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:26,440
hours.

88
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:29,920
This was due in part to the fact that the project was significantly understaffed in

89
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:34,260
its first few days as they scrambled to find workers, especially as its start coincided

90
00:05:34,260 --> 00:05:36,040
with Chinese New Year's.

91
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:40,040
Once the land was leveled, though, they moved on to constructing the building foundations

92
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:42,340
by Sunday, January 26th.

93
00:05:42,340 --> 00:05:44,960
For this, they used a layered system.

94
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:49,640
On the bottom, an 8 inch or 20 centimeter layer of sand was placed, then what's referred

95
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:55,020
to as a geotextile layer, a form of fabric, then a layer of waterproof plastic, then another

96
00:05:55,020 --> 00:05:58,520
geotextile layer, then another layer of sand.

97
00:05:58,520 --> 00:06:02,900
On that, they then poured concrete, which dried over a few days.

98
00:06:02,900 --> 00:06:09,040
But then came the truly impressive element—constructing the buildings themselves in a matter of days.

99
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:13,100
What made this possible was the use of prefabricated elements.

100
00:06:13,100 --> 00:06:16,260
Modular construction such as this has been on the rise recently.

101
00:06:16,260 --> 00:06:21,820
It's now a well-established technique for the construction of buildings large and small.

102
00:06:21,820 --> 00:06:26,860
The idea is, simply, that somewhere off-site a number of identical building elements are

103
00:06:26,860 --> 00:06:27,860
built.

104
00:06:27,860 --> 00:06:31,540
Then, they're shipped to the construction site and put together.

105
00:06:31,540 --> 00:06:34,300
This has plenty of advantages.

106
00:06:34,300 --> 00:06:39,000
First and foremost, the use of identical elements, built in a factory system, to construct a

107
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:42,460
larger building lowers costs through economies of scale.

108
00:06:42,460 --> 00:06:46,800
Then, when you actually get to putting the building together, on-site construction time

109
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:50,520
is significantly less, which once again lowers cost.

110
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:56,280
In this case, though, cost was not the primary concern—speed was—and modular construction

111
00:06:56,280 --> 00:06:59,080
is the fastest way to build.

112
00:06:59,080 --> 00:07:03,680
Most of the site used a type of prefabricated modular construction common with temporary

113
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:04,680
buildings.

114
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:08,240
While it's not clear which company produced the prefabricated components, it is clear

115
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:10,840
that they existed before the project started.

116
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:15,400
The first building elements started coming together on Monday, January 27th—just four

117
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:18,000
days after the project broke ground.

118
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,520
They began by building the skeleton of the modular units.

119
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:25,760
Each of these units was about the shape and size of a 20-foot shipping container and this

120
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:30,600
skeleton form included just the floor, ceiling, and structural supports at each corner.

121
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:34,480
Throughout this all, separate teams, out of the thousands of workers there, started to

122
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:38,960
hook the site up to utilities like sewage, water, electricity, and internet.

123
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:43,200
Much of this just involved bringing in the state-owned companies responsible for these,

124
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:47,400
but for internet, and the subsequent building out of an IT system, private companies like

125
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:49,880
Huawei and Lenovo got involved.

126
00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:53,840
This was, no doubt, partially because the construction of this hospital drew considerable

127
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:55,800
public attention in China.

128
00:07:55,800 --> 00:08:00,080
It came to represent the physical manifestation of the country's response to the crisis

129
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:02,880
and also of China's engineering might.

130
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:06,760
The construction process itself was streamed by state-owned broadcasting companies and

131
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:10,720
up to 18 million concurrent viewers watched the process.

132
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:14,920
Nearly every major broadcaster in China reported from the site, publishing footage like what

133
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:19,080
you're seeing now, although very few Western broadcasters were there.

134
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:23,340
This is part of the reason limited detailed information and footage of the construction

135
00:08:23,340 --> 00:08:28,120
exists outside of China's state-owned broadcasters—where the government can manage the story and what

136
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:29,120
gets out.

137
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:33,360
It was, no doubt, viewed as an opportunity by the Chinese government in a time when it

138
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:37,480
faced intense criticism for its initial response to the outbreak.

139
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:42,220
But of course, to gain that praise, the project needed to be successful.

140
00:08:42,220 --> 00:08:47,080
On Tuesday, January 28th, significant portions of the first building were completed while

141
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:50,180
the rest of the complex's foundations were finishing up.

142
00:08:50,180 --> 00:08:55,180
Over the 29th and 30th, more of the overall structure came to be as the walls were installed

143
00:08:55,180 --> 00:08:59,800
on and in the skeletons of buildings and work then began on turning these empty buildings

144
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:01,200
into a hospital.

145
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:05,980
Each patient room was outfitted with two beds, some medical equipment, and a bathroom.

146
00:09:05,980 --> 00:09:10,580
Considering the hospital is built with quarantine in mind, there are some unique aspects to

147
00:09:10,580 --> 00:09:12,460
the design of these rooms.

148
00:09:12,460 --> 00:09:17,420
For one, the ventilation system is built to keep negative pressure in all quarantine areas

149
00:09:17,420 --> 00:09:21,460
so that air will go out through an exhaust system rather than out under the door into

150
00:09:21,460 --> 00:09:22,780
the rest of the hospital.

151
00:09:22,780 --> 00:09:27,020
While at the time of writing it's not entirely known to what extent this coronavirus can

152
00:09:27,020 --> 00:09:32,140
spread through airborne transmission, a ventilation system like this is standard practice for

153
00:09:32,140 --> 00:09:34,060
any quarantine ward.

154
00:09:34,060 --> 00:09:38,700
In addition to individual patient rooms, separate areas were designed for patient processing,

155
00:09:38,700 --> 00:09:43,500
diagnostic tools like CT scanners were installed, and other crucial aspects like offices, break

156
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:45,740
rooms, and canteens were built in.

157
00:09:45,740 --> 00:09:50,820
Over the 31st of January and 1st and 2nd of February, the final areas of the complex were

158
00:09:50,820 --> 00:09:55,600
built up, the interior installation was ramped up, and all the systems were tested to assure

159
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:58,140
that the hospital was ready to bring in patients.

160
00:09:58,140 --> 00:10:02,620
Meanwhile, eight People's Liberation Army transport planes landed at Wuhan Airport carrying

161
00:10:02,620 --> 00:10:05,260
the military medical staff who would staff the hospital.

162
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:09,700
They moved into the facility throughout the same day, February 2nd, then throughout the

163
00:10:09,700 --> 00:10:13,980
night, workers put the finishing touches onto the hundreds of rooms.

164
00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:19,800
Then, the next morning, the moment that ten days prior seemed impossible arrived.

165
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:23,920
The first patients, transferred from other facilities, were wheeled into Huoshenshan

166
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:27,020
Hospital and thus marked the beginning of its operations.

167
00:10:27,020 --> 00:10:31,860
They started with just a few dozen patients, but in a matter of days this ballooned to

168
00:10:31,860 --> 00:10:32,860
hundreds.

169
00:10:32,940 --> 00:10:37,700
Huoshenshan Hospital was only the start of China's plan to ramp up the number of available

170
00:10:37,700 --> 00:10:39,500
beds in Wuhan.

171
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:44,420
Just three days after Huoshenshan's opening, another, even larger hospital called Leishunshan

172
00:10:44,420 --> 00:10:45,420
opened.

173
00:10:45,420 --> 00:10:50,580
Its 1,600 beds and 32 wards were built in just 12 days.

174
00:10:50,580 --> 00:10:54,900
Meanwhile, other hospitals were converted to isolate and treat coronavirus patients,

175
00:10:54,900 --> 00:10:58,940
and stadiums and exhibition centers were turned into hospitals as well.

176
00:10:58,940 --> 00:11:03,920
Still, though, even with this swift, decisive action, reports indicate that many of those

177
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:09,180
with milder cases of coronavirus are getting turned away from hospitals in Wuhan.

178
00:11:09,180 --> 00:11:14,660
It unfortunately seems that coronavirus, with its tremendous severity, is one of the few

179
00:11:14,660 --> 00:11:18,640
things that can outpace China.

180
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:23,620
If you want to learn more about how viruses such as this work from a biological perspective,

181
00:11:23,620 --> 00:11:29,260
CuriosityStream has a fascinating short documentary on one previous epidemic—the Zika virus.

182
00:11:29,260 --> 00:11:33,140
There's plenty in there that applies to the current coronavirus outbreak, and this

183
00:11:33,140 --> 00:11:39,580
is just one of thousands of top-quality non-fiction shows and documentaries you can watch on CuriosityStream.

184
00:11:39,580 --> 00:11:44,740
Of course, the library you get through a CuriosityStream subscription is now much larger thanks to

185
00:11:44,740 --> 00:11:49,460
their bundle deal with Nebula—the streaming platform created by myself and loads of other

186
00:11:49,460 --> 00:11:51,220
educational creators.

187
00:11:51,220 --> 00:11:55,100
We made Nebula to be the home of our big, ambitious projects.

188
00:11:55,100 --> 00:12:00,180
My next Nebula Original, a TV-length documentary, is being filmed right as this video comes

189
00:12:00,180 --> 00:12:03,660
out and will release exclusively on Nebula very soon.

190
00:12:03,660 --> 00:12:08,100
To make sure you get to see that, along with all the other great originals by other creators,
