9240	15760	The Wuhan coronavirus began, like all new viruses, with a remarkably ordinary moment.
15760	22680	In late November, 2019, someone—it is not yet known who—ate a wild animal that, by
22680	27720	chance, carried the novel coronavirus and days later, started to feel the symptoms of
27720	30840	what initially seemed like a bad cold.
30840	35500	From there, more individuals were infected—at first through the consumption of other wild
35500	38960	animals, but later through direct human-to-human transmission.
38960	45100	For the entire month of December, the virus was there, in Wuhan, spreading, but nobody
45100	46100	knew it.
46100	50480	The cases, presenting as pneumonia, were at first considered to be caused by any one of
50480	55240	the countless other viruses that can create such symptoms, but eventually, the escalation
55240	60300	in cases, and the fact that almost all the first patients had bought food at one particular
60300	64900	wild animal market, caught the Wuhan city government's attention.
64900	69280	The first official confirmation that something was up came on New Year's Eve, December
69280	73520	31st, when the Municipal Health Commission published a press release acknowledging the
73520	77320	situation, over a month after the first transmission.
77320	83120	At the time, this was small local news—only a few dozen cases of pneumonia in a city of
83120	86280	millions in a country of a billion.
86280	90660	But then came the news that this was not one of the many pre-existing pneumonia-causing
90660	92200	viruses.
92200	94760	This was something new.
94760	99360	Western media first reported on the novel coronavirus around January 8th.
99360	103980	The New York Times, forebodingly, wrote, there is no evidence that the new virus is readily
103980	108400	spread by humans and it has not been tied to any deaths.
108400	109880	That would soon change.
109880	114480	On January 21st, when the World Health Organization started tracking the outbreak, there were
114480	116960	282 cases.
116960	119360	The next day, 314.
119360	121480	The next, 581.
121480	123920	Then 846.
123920	126440	Then 1,320.
126440	128560	Then 2,014.
128560	133720	And by the start of the week of January 26th, it was clear that this would not be a quick
133720	135440	and painless virus.
135440	138960	This would be one for the history books, and it was going to get a lot worse before it
139040	141280	got any better.
141280	144040	Drastic circumstances called for drastic action.
144040	148840	It was clear, given the trends, that Wuhan's hospitals would soon be overwhelmed by patients
148840	154200	and, in the case of highly infectious viruses like coronavirus, that makes a bad situation
154200	158960	worse as infected individuals will try to recover at home, where the virus can more
158960	160200	easily spread.
160200	165920	Therefore, the decision was made, on January 23rd, to build a brand new facility capable
165920	170520	of treating 1,000 patients at once—Woshenshun Hospital.
170520	176480	It was announced that this would be done, fully constructed, by February 2nd, just ten
176480	178560	days later.
178560	181560	China has experience with such a feat.
181560	187280	In 2003, the country suffered an outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome, or SARS,
187280	190160	which is also caused by a form of coronavirus.
190160	195080	Much like with the novel coronavirus, hospitals were overwhelmed and many had to turn away
195080	196080	from this.
196080	199780	In response, the government decided to build a new hospital.
199780	205100	Over six days, 7,000 construction workers brought the Xiaotongshan Hospital into reality
205100	209560	and it quickly began accepting patients and relieving the overstressed medical system.
209560	213800	Once the outbreak settled down, the Xiaotongshan Hospital was hailed as a massive success by
213800	217120	both the country itself and the World Health Organization.
217120	219200	The statistics speak for themselves.
219200	222760	Overall, SARS had a fatality rate of 9.6%.
222760	229360	At the Xiaotongshan Hospital, just 1.2% of patients died and not a single staff member
229360	230360	was infected.
230360	235060	It's no wonder why China wanted to replicate this and therefore Xiaotongshan was the model
235060	239200	for the new coronavirus hospital, but this time would be different.
239200	244320	The 2003 hospital began construction over six months after the beginning of the outbreak.
244320	249320	The 2020 hospital started construction less than two months after the first case and just
249320	252960	days after the seriousness of the outbreak became clear.
252960	256020	There was far less time for planning and design.
256020	260180	The orders came and then it was immediately time to start.
260180	263280	Step one was finding a place to put the hospital.
263280	268220	The location selected was previously just an open field about 14 miles or 22 kilometers
268220	269680	from central Wuhan.
269680	274100	This kept it away from the dense urban core, where further transmission might be easier,
274100	279140	and the field in question was also right off a large pre-existing road which made access
279140	280340	easy.
280340	284740	That road was quickly shut down and turned into, essentially, a parking lot and staging
284740	286240	area for the project.
286240	290260	The contract for this project was given to China Construction Third Engineering Bureau
290260	295380	Company—a subsidiary of the state-owned China State Construction Engineering Corporation.
295380	299400	By revenue, this is the world's largest construction company and it has experience
299400	304280	in enormous projects like Beijing's new airport, Egypt's new capital city, and Tesla's
304280	305780	Shanghai Gigafactory.
305780	309000	If anyone was going to pull this off, it was them.
309000	313980	To begin construction in earnest, they first needed to prepare the selected site.
313980	318480	That involved, first, cutting down all the trees and shrubbery and then perfectly levelling
318480	319680	the ground.
319680	325440	Out of the 10-day construction timeline, this took longer than one might think—about 48
325440	326440	hours.
326480	329920	This was due in part to the fact that the project was significantly understaffed in
329920	334260	its first few days as they scrambled to find workers, especially as its start coincided
334260	336040	with Chinese New Year's.
336040	340040	Once the land was leveled, though, they moved on to constructing the building foundations
340040	342340	by Sunday, January 26th.
342340	344960	For this, they used a layered system.
344960	349640	On the bottom, an 8 inch or 20 centimeter layer of sand was placed, then what's referred
349640	355020	to as a geotextile layer, a form of fabric, then a layer of waterproof plastic, then another
355020	358520	geotextile layer, then another layer of sand.
358520	362900	On that, they then poured concrete, which dried over a few days.
362900	369040	But then came the truly impressive element—constructing the buildings themselves in a matter of days.
369040	373100	What made this possible was the use of prefabricated elements.
373100	376260	Modular construction such as this has been on the rise recently.
376260	381820	It's now a well-established technique for the construction of buildings large and small.
381820	386860	The idea is, simply, that somewhere off-site a number of identical building elements are
386860	387860	built.
387860	391540	Then, they're shipped to the construction site and put together.
391540	394300	This has plenty of advantages.
394300	399000	First and foremost, the use of identical elements, built in a factory system, to construct a
399000	402460	larger building lowers costs through economies of scale.
402460	406800	Then, when you actually get to putting the building together, on-site construction time
406800	410520	is significantly less, which once again lowers cost.
410520	416280	In this case, though, cost was not the primary concern—speed was—and modular construction
416280	419080	is the fastest way to build.
419080	423680	Most of the site used a type of prefabricated modular construction common with temporary
423680	424680	buildings.
424680	428240	While it's not clear which company produced the prefabricated components, it is clear
428240	430840	that they existed before the project started.
430840	435400	The first building elements started coming together on Monday, January 27th—just four
435400	438000	days after the project broke ground.
438000	441520	They began by building the skeleton of the modular units.
441520	445760	Each of these units was about the shape and size of a 20-foot shipping container and this
445760	450600	skeleton form included just the floor, ceiling, and structural supports at each corner.
450600	454480	Throughout this all, separate teams, out of the thousands of workers there, started to
454480	458960	hook the site up to utilities like sewage, water, electricity, and internet.
458960	463200	Much of this just involved bringing in the state-owned companies responsible for these,
463200	467400	but for internet, and the subsequent building out of an IT system, private companies like
467440	469880	Huawei and Lenovo got involved.
469880	473840	This was, no doubt, partially because the construction of this hospital drew considerable
473840	475800	public attention in China.
475800	480080	It came to represent the physical manifestation of the country's response to the crisis
480080	482880	and also of China's engineering might.
482880	486760	The construction process itself was streamed by state-owned broadcasting companies and
486760	490720	up to 18 million concurrent viewers watched the process.
490720	494920	Nearly every major broadcaster in China reported from the site, publishing footage like what
494920	499080	you're seeing now, although very few Western broadcasters were there.
499080	503340	This is part of the reason limited detailed information and footage of the construction
503340	508120	exists outside of China's state-owned broadcasters—where the government can manage the story and what
508120	509120	gets out.
509120	513360	It was, no doubt, viewed as an opportunity by the Chinese government in a time when it
513360	517480	faced intense criticism for its initial response to the outbreak.
517480	522220	But of course, to gain that praise, the project needed to be successful.
522220	527080	On Tuesday, January 28th, significant portions of the first building were completed while
527080	530180	the rest of the complex's foundations were finishing up.
530180	535180	Over the 29th and 30th, more of the overall structure came to be as the walls were installed
535180	539800	on and in the skeletons of buildings and work then began on turning these empty buildings
539800	541200	into a hospital.
541200	545980	Each patient room was outfitted with two beds, some medical equipment, and a bathroom.
545980	550580	Considering the hospital is built with quarantine in mind, there are some unique aspects to
550580	552460	the design of these rooms.
552460	557420	For one, the ventilation system is built to keep negative pressure in all quarantine areas
557420	561460	so that air will go out through an exhaust system rather than out under the door into
561460	562780	the rest of the hospital.
562780	567020	While at the time of writing it's not entirely known to what extent this coronavirus can
567020	572140	spread through airborne transmission, a ventilation system like this is standard practice for
572140	574060	any quarantine ward.
574060	578700	In addition to individual patient rooms, separate areas were designed for patient processing,
578700	583500	diagnostic tools like CT scanners were installed, and other crucial aspects like offices, break
583500	585740	rooms, and canteens were built in.
585740	590820	Over the 31st of January and 1st and 2nd of February, the final areas of the complex were
590820	595600	built up, the interior installation was ramped up, and all the systems were tested to assure
595600	598140	that the hospital was ready to bring in patients.
598140	602620	Meanwhile, eight People's Liberation Army transport planes landed at Wuhan Airport carrying
602620	605260	the military medical staff who would staff the hospital.
605320	609700	They moved into the facility throughout the same day, February 2nd, then throughout the
609700	613980	night, workers put the finishing touches onto the hundreds of rooms.
613980	619800	Then, the next morning, the moment that ten days prior seemed impossible arrived.
619800	623920	The first patients, transferred from other facilities, were wheeled into Huoshenshan
623920	627020	Hospital and thus marked the beginning of its operations.
627020	631860	They started with just a few dozen patients, but in a matter of days this ballooned to
631860	632860	hundreds.
632940	637700	Huoshenshan Hospital was only the start of China's plan to ramp up the number of available
637700	639500	beds in Wuhan.
639500	644420	Just three days after Huoshenshan's opening, another, even larger hospital called Leishunshan
644420	645420	opened.
645420	650580	Its 1,600 beds and 32 wards were built in just 12 days.
650580	654900	Meanwhile, other hospitals were converted to isolate and treat coronavirus patients,
654900	658940	and stadiums and exhibition centers were turned into hospitals as well.
658940	663920	Still, though, even with this swift, decisive action, reports indicate that many of those
663920	669180	with milder cases of coronavirus are getting turned away from hospitals in Wuhan.
669180	674660	It unfortunately seems that coronavirus, with its tremendous severity, is one of the few
674660	678640	things that can outpace China.
678640	683620	If you want to learn more about how viruses such as this work from a biological perspective,
