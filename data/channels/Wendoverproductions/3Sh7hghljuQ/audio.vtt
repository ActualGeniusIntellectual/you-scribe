00:09.240 --> 00:15.760
The Wuhan coronavirus began, like all new viruses, with a remarkably ordinary moment.

00:15.760 --> 00:22.680
In late November, 2019, someone—it is not yet known who—ate a wild animal that, by

00:22.680 --> 00:27.720
chance, carried the novel coronavirus and days later, started to feel the symptoms of

00:27.720 --> 00:30.840
what initially seemed like a bad cold.

00:30.840 --> 00:35.500
From there, more individuals were infected—at first through the consumption of other wild

00:35.500 --> 00:38.960
animals, but later through direct human-to-human transmission.

00:38.960 --> 00:45.100
For the entire month of December, the virus was there, in Wuhan, spreading, but nobody

00:45.100 --> 00:46.100
knew it.

00:46.100 --> 00:50.480
The cases, presenting as pneumonia, were at first considered to be caused by any one of

00:50.480 --> 00:55.240
the countless other viruses that can create such symptoms, but eventually, the escalation

00:55.240 --> 01:00.300
in cases, and the fact that almost all the first patients had bought food at one particular

01:00.300 --> 01:04.900
wild animal market, caught the Wuhan city government's attention.

01:04.900 --> 01:09.280
The first official confirmation that something was up came on New Year's Eve, December

01:09.280 --> 01:13.520
31st, when the Municipal Health Commission published a press release acknowledging the

01:13.520 --> 01:17.320
situation, over a month after the first transmission.

01:17.320 --> 01:23.120
At the time, this was small local news—only a few dozen cases of pneumonia in a city of

01:23.120 --> 01:26.280
millions in a country of a billion.

01:26.280 --> 01:30.660
But then came the news that this was not one of the many pre-existing pneumonia-causing

01:30.660 --> 01:32.200
viruses.

01:32.200 --> 01:34.760
This was something new.

01:34.760 --> 01:39.360
Western media first reported on the novel coronavirus around January 8th.

01:39.360 --> 01:43.980
The New York Times, forebodingly, wrote, there is no evidence that the new virus is readily

01:43.980 --> 01:48.400
spread by humans and it has not been tied to any deaths.

01:48.400 --> 01:49.880
That would soon change.

01:49.880 --> 01:54.480
On January 21st, when the World Health Organization started tracking the outbreak, there were

01:54.480 --> 01:56.960
282 cases.

01:56.960 --> 01:59.360
The next day, 314.

01:59.360 --> 02:01.480
The next, 581.

02:01.480 --> 02:03.920
Then 846.

02:03.920 --> 02:06.440
Then 1,320.

02:06.440 --> 02:08.560
Then 2,014.

02:08.560 --> 02:13.720
And by the start of the week of January 26th, it was clear that this would not be a quick

02:13.720 --> 02:15.440
and painless virus.

02:15.440 --> 02:18.960
This would be one for the history books, and it was going to get a lot worse before it

02:19.040 --> 02:21.280
got any better.

02:21.280 --> 02:24.040
Drastic circumstances called for drastic action.

02:24.040 --> 02:28.840
It was clear, given the trends, that Wuhan's hospitals would soon be overwhelmed by patients

02:28.840 --> 02:34.200
and, in the case of highly infectious viruses like coronavirus, that makes a bad situation

02:34.200 --> 02:38.960
worse as infected individuals will try to recover at home, where the virus can more

02:38.960 --> 02:40.200
easily spread.

02:40.200 --> 02:45.920
Therefore, the decision was made, on January 23rd, to build a brand new facility capable

02:45.920 --> 02:50.520
of treating 1,000 patients at once—Woshenshun Hospital.

02:50.520 --> 02:56.480
It was announced that this would be done, fully constructed, by February 2nd, just ten

02:56.480 --> 02:58.560
days later.

02:58.560 --> 03:01.560
China has experience with such a feat.

03:01.560 --> 03:07.280
In 2003, the country suffered an outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome, or SARS,

03:07.280 --> 03:10.160
which is also caused by a form of coronavirus.

03:10.160 --> 03:15.080
Much like with the novel coronavirus, hospitals were overwhelmed and many had to turn away

03:15.080 --> 03:16.080
from this.

03:16.080 --> 03:19.780
In response, the government decided to build a new hospital.

03:19.780 --> 03:25.100
Over six days, 7,000 construction workers brought the Xiaotongshan Hospital into reality

03:25.100 --> 03:29.560
and it quickly began accepting patients and relieving the overstressed medical system.

03:29.560 --> 03:33.800
Once the outbreak settled down, the Xiaotongshan Hospital was hailed as a massive success by

03:33.800 --> 03:37.120
both the country itself and the World Health Organization.

03:37.120 --> 03:39.200
The statistics speak for themselves.

03:39.200 --> 03:42.760
Overall, SARS had a fatality rate of 9.6%.

03:42.760 --> 03:49.360
At the Xiaotongshan Hospital, just 1.2% of patients died and not a single staff member

03:49.360 --> 03:50.360
was infected.

03:50.360 --> 03:55.060
It's no wonder why China wanted to replicate this and therefore Xiaotongshan was the model

03:55.060 --> 03:59.200
for the new coronavirus hospital, but this time would be different.

03:59.200 --> 04:04.320
The 2003 hospital began construction over six months after the beginning of the outbreak.

04:04.320 --> 04:09.320
The 2020 hospital started construction less than two months after the first case and just

04:09.320 --> 04:12.960
days after the seriousness of the outbreak became clear.

04:12.960 --> 04:16.020
There was far less time for planning and design.

04:16.020 --> 04:20.180
The orders came and then it was immediately time to start.

04:20.180 --> 04:23.280
Step one was finding a place to put the hospital.

04:23.280 --> 04:28.220
The location selected was previously just an open field about 14 miles or 22 kilometers

04:28.220 --> 04:29.680
from central Wuhan.

04:29.680 --> 04:34.100
This kept it away from the dense urban core, where further transmission might be easier,

04:34.100 --> 04:39.140
and the field in question was also right off a large pre-existing road which made access

04:39.140 --> 04:40.340
easy.

04:40.340 --> 04:44.740
That road was quickly shut down and turned into, essentially, a parking lot and staging

04:44.740 --> 04:46.240
area for the project.

04:46.240 --> 04:50.260
The contract for this project was given to China Construction Third Engineering Bureau

04:50.260 --> 04:55.380
Company—a subsidiary of the state-owned China State Construction Engineering Corporation.

04:55.380 --> 04:59.400
By revenue, this is the world's largest construction company and it has experience

04:59.400 --> 05:04.280
in enormous projects like Beijing's new airport, Egypt's new capital city, and Tesla's

05:04.280 --> 05:05.780
Shanghai Gigafactory.

05:05.780 --> 05:09.000
If anyone was going to pull this off, it was them.

05:09.000 --> 05:13.980
To begin construction in earnest, they first needed to prepare the selected site.

05:13.980 --> 05:18.480
That involved, first, cutting down all the trees and shrubbery and then perfectly levelling

05:18.480 --> 05:19.680
the ground.

05:19.680 --> 05:25.440
Out of the 10-day construction timeline, this took longer than one might think—about 48

05:25.440 --> 05:26.440
hours.

05:26.480 --> 05:29.920
This was due in part to the fact that the project was significantly understaffed in

05:29.920 --> 05:34.260
its first few days as they scrambled to find workers, especially as its start coincided

05:34.260 --> 05:36.040
with Chinese New Year's.

05:36.040 --> 05:40.040
Once the land was leveled, though, they moved on to constructing the building foundations

05:40.040 --> 05:42.340
by Sunday, January 26th.

05:42.340 --> 05:44.960
For this, they used a layered system.

05:44.960 --> 05:49.640
On the bottom, an 8 inch or 20 centimeter layer of sand was placed, then what's referred

05:49.640 --> 05:55.020
to as a geotextile layer, a form of fabric, then a layer of waterproof plastic, then another

05:55.020 --> 05:58.520
geotextile layer, then another layer of sand.

05:58.520 --> 06:02.900
On that, they then poured concrete, which dried over a few days.

06:02.900 --> 06:09.040
But then came the truly impressive element—constructing the buildings themselves in a matter of days.

06:09.040 --> 06:13.100
What made this possible was the use of prefabricated elements.

06:13.100 --> 06:16.260
Modular construction such as this has been on the rise recently.

06:16.260 --> 06:21.820
It's now a well-established technique for the construction of buildings large and small.

06:21.820 --> 06:26.860
The idea is, simply, that somewhere off-site a number of identical building elements are

06:26.860 --> 06:27.860
built.

06:27.860 --> 06:31.540
Then, they're shipped to the construction site and put together.

06:31.540 --> 06:34.300
This has plenty of advantages.

06:34.300 --> 06:39.000
First and foremost, the use of identical elements, built in a factory system, to construct a

06:39.000 --> 06:42.460
larger building lowers costs through economies of scale.

06:42.460 --> 06:46.800
Then, when you actually get to putting the building together, on-site construction time

06:46.800 --> 06:50.520
is significantly less, which once again lowers cost.

06:50.520 --> 06:56.280
In this case, though, cost was not the primary concern—speed was—and modular construction

06:56.280 --> 06:59.080
is the fastest way to build.

06:59.080 --> 07:03.680
Most of the site used a type of prefabricated modular construction common with temporary

07:03.680 --> 07:04.680
buildings.

07:04.680 --> 07:08.240
While it's not clear which company produced the prefabricated components, it is clear

07:08.240 --> 07:10.840
that they existed before the project started.

07:10.840 --> 07:15.400
The first building elements started coming together on Monday, January 27th—just four

07:15.400 --> 07:18.000
days after the project broke ground.

07:18.000 --> 07:21.520
They began by building the skeleton of the modular units.

07:21.520 --> 07:25.760
Each of these units was about the shape and size of a 20-foot shipping container and this

07:25.760 --> 07:30.600
skeleton form included just the floor, ceiling, and structural supports at each corner.

07:30.600 --> 07:34.480
Throughout this all, separate teams, out of the thousands of workers there, started to

07:34.480 --> 07:38.960
hook the site up to utilities like sewage, water, electricity, and internet.

07:38.960 --> 07:43.200
Much of this just involved bringing in the state-owned companies responsible for these,

07:43.200 --> 07:47.400
but for internet, and the subsequent building out of an IT system, private companies like

07:47.440 --> 07:49.880
Huawei and Lenovo got involved.

07:49.880 --> 07:53.840
This was, no doubt, partially because the construction of this hospital drew considerable

07:53.840 --> 07:55.800
public attention in China.

07:55.800 --> 08:00.080
It came to represent the physical manifestation of the country's response to the crisis

08:00.080 --> 08:02.880
and also of China's engineering might.

08:02.880 --> 08:06.760
The construction process itself was streamed by state-owned broadcasting companies and

08:06.760 --> 08:10.720
up to 18 million concurrent viewers watched the process.

08:10.720 --> 08:14.920
Nearly every major broadcaster in China reported from the site, publishing footage like what

08:14.920 --> 08:19.080
you're seeing now, although very few Western broadcasters were there.

08:19.080 --> 08:23.340
This is part of the reason limited detailed information and footage of the construction

08:23.340 --> 08:28.120
exists outside of China's state-owned broadcasters—where the government can manage the story and what

08:28.120 --> 08:29.120
gets out.

08:29.120 --> 08:33.360
It was, no doubt, viewed as an opportunity by the Chinese government in a time when it

08:33.360 --> 08:37.480
faced intense criticism for its initial response to the outbreak.

08:37.480 --> 08:42.220
But of course, to gain that praise, the project needed to be successful.

08:42.220 --> 08:47.080
On Tuesday, January 28th, significant portions of the first building were completed while

08:47.080 --> 08:50.180
the rest of the complex's foundations were finishing up.

08:50.180 --> 08:55.180
Over the 29th and 30th, more of the overall structure came to be as the walls were installed

08:55.180 --> 08:59.800
on and in the skeletons of buildings and work then began on turning these empty buildings

08:59.800 --> 09:01.200
into a hospital.

09:01.200 --> 09:05.980
Each patient room was outfitted with two beds, some medical equipment, and a bathroom.

09:05.980 --> 09:10.580
Considering the hospital is built with quarantine in mind, there are some unique aspects to

09:10.580 --> 09:12.460
the design of these rooms.

09:12.460 --> 09:17.420
For one, the ventilation system is built to keep negative pressure in all quarantine areas

09:17.420 --> 09:21.460
so that air will go out through an exhaust system rather than out under the door into

09:21.460 --> 09:22.780
the rest of the hospital.

09:22.780 --> 09:27.020
While at the time of writing it's not entirely known to what extent this coronavirus can

09:27.020 --> 09:32.140
spread through airborne transmission, a ventilation system like this is standard practice for

09:32.140 --> 09:34.060
any quarantine ward.

09:34.060 --> 09:38.700
In addition to individual patient rooms, separate areas were designed for patient processing,

09:38.700 --> 09:43.500
diagnostic tools like CT scanners were installed, and other crucial aspects like offices, break

09:43.500 --> 09:45.740
rooms, and canteens were built in.

09:45.740 --> 09:50.820
Over the 31st of January and 1st and 2nd of February, the final areas of the complex were

09:50.820 --> 09:55.600
built up, the interior installation was ramped up, and all the systems were tested to assure

09:55.600 --> 09:58.140
that the hospital was ready to bring in patients.

09:58.140 --> 10:02.620
Meanwhile, eight People's Liberation Army transport planes landed at Wuhan Airport carrying

10:02.620 --> 10:05.260
the military medical staff who would staff the hospital.

10:05.320 --> 10:09.700
They moved into the facility throughout the same day, February 2nd, then throughout the

10:09.700 --> 10:13.980
night, workers put the finishing touches onto the hundreds of rooms.

10:13.980 --> 10:19.800
Then, the next morning, the moment that ten days prior seemed impossible arrived.

10:19.800 --> 10:23.920
The first patients, transferred from other facilities, were wheeled into Huoshenshan

10:23.920 --> 10:27.020
Hospital and thus marked the beginning of its operations.

10:27.020 --> 10:31.860
They started with just a few dozen patients, but in a matter of days this ballooned to

10:31.860 --> 10:32.860
hundreds.

10:32.940 --> 10:37.700
Huoshenshan Hospital was only the start of China's plan to ramp up the number of available

10:37.700 --> 10:39.500
beds in Wuhan.

10:39.500 --> 10:44.420
Just three days after Huoshenshan's opening, another, even larger hospital called Leishunshan

10:44.420 --> 10:45.420
opened.

10:45.420 --> 10:50.580
Its 1,600 beds and 32 wards were built in just 12 days.

10:50.580 --> 10:54.900
Meanwhile, other hospitals were converted to isolate and treat coronavirus patients,

10:54.900 --> 10:58.940
and stadiums and exhibition centers were turned into hospitals as well.

10:58.940 --> 11:03.920
Still, though, even with this swift, decisive action, reports indicate that many of those

11:03.920 --> 11:09.180
with milder cases of coronavirus are getting turned away from hospitals in Wuhan.

11:09.180 --> 11:14.660
It unfortunately seems that coronavirus, with its tremendous severity, is one of the few

11:14.660 --> 11:18.640
things that can outpace China.

11:18.640 --> 11:23.620
If you want to learn more about how viruses such as this work from a biological perspective,

11:23.620 --> 11:29.260
CuriosityStream has a fascinating short documentary on one previous epidemic—the Zika virus.

11:29.260 --> 11:33.140
There's plenty in there that applies to the current coronavirus outbreak, and this

11:33.140 --> 11:39.580
is just one of thousands of top-quality non-fiction shows and documentaries you can watch on CuriosityStream.
