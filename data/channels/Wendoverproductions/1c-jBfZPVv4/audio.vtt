Hello, I'm Sam.

00:02.120 --> 00:18.180
This is my channel, this is that Wikipedia list, and this is that Wikipedia list.

00:18.180 --> 00:19.680
You can't copy money.

00:19.680 --> 00:21.540
I don't mean it's illegal, that's obvious.

00:21.540 --> 00:25.820
I mean that you physically cannot copy money on a photocopier.

00:25.820 --> 00:31.140
This is probably the only thing in the world that your copier will simply refuse to copy.

00:31.140 --> 00:35.500
With pretty much any modern copier, an error message will come up if you put a banknote

00:35.500 --> 00:38.140
or something resembling a banknote in the scanner.

00:38.140 --> 00:41.540
I'd tell you to try it, but there are so many laws surrounding currency that I'm

00:41.540 --> 00:45.040
pretty sure I'd have the police kicking down my door tomorrow if I did.

00:45.040 --> 00:46.460
You can just take my word for it.

00:46.460 --> 00:50.280
It's pretty interesting how money is detected by photocopiers.

00:50.280 --> 00:55.020
For almost any major currency, there's one symbol that tells machines that what they're

00:55.020 --> 00:56.180
seeing is money.

00:56.180 --> 00:59.860
It's called the Eurion constellation and it looks like this.

00:59.860 --> 01:03.940
It was first discovered on the 10 euro note in this cluster of circles, but has since

01:03.940 --> 01:10.700
been found on the American dollar, the Swedish krona, the UK pound, and pretty much every

01:10.700 --> 01:12.780
other major currency.

01:12.780 --> 01:17.940
Most photocopiers will, if they see this pattern of dots, stop printing in an attempt to stop

01:17.940 --> 01:18.940
counterfeit.

01:18.940 --> 01:21.400
At least, that's how it used to be.

01:21.400 --> 01:25.840
More recently, copiers have moved to a system called the counterfeit deterrent system which

01:25.840 --> 01:28.960
is incredibly secretive and effective.

01:28.960 --> 01:33.000
Nobody is really sure how it works, and while the Eurion constellation might be part of

01:33.000 --> 01:37.320
it, these security measures make it even more difficult to copy banknotes.

01:37.320 --> 01:42.360
Adobe Photoshop, like most photo editing softwares, has the counterfeit deterrent system built

01:42.360 --> 01:45.480
in, which lets you see just how well it works.

01:45.480 --> 01:49.820
Photoshop can of course detect this image of a 10 pound note since its Eurion constellations

01:49.820 --> 01:54.740
are clearly visible, but then it can also detect it if the area is blacked out.

01:54.740 --> 01:59.340
It can even figure out that this tiny, almost completely blacked out image is part of a

01:59.340 --> 02:02.220
US $20 bill and refuse to edit it.

02:02.220 --> 02:07.120
There's a ton of different laws relating to the duplication and publication of visuals

02:07.120 --> 02:08.380
of currency.

02:08.380 --> 02:12.660
The US has 32 pages of laws related to currency.

02:12.660 --> 02:17.260
Along with the obvious illegality of counterfeit, it's also illegal in the US to print or

02:17.260 --> 02:22.700
publish any illustration of currency, postage stamps, or revenue stamps of any nation in

02:22.700 --> 02:27.380
the world unless, of course, it's a stamp made under the Migratory Bird Hunting Stamp

02:27.380 --> 02:31.420
Act of 1934 and no, that's not a joke.

02:31.420 --> 02:36.260
It's also illegal to deface currency in any way or to use the image of currency in

02:36.260 --> 02:37.260
any advertisement.

02:37.260 --> 02:42.760
It is, however, legal to show authentic banknotes in videos and films.

02:42.760 --> 02:47.020
For this reason, in most cases, the money used in movies is real.

02:47.020 --> 02:53.340
To legally create prop money, the bill has to be less than 75% or more than 150% of the

02:53.340 --> 02:59.480
size of authentic currency, one sided, and must be destroyed immediately after use.

02:59.480 --> 03:02.580
Unless they want to do something that's illegal with money, like burn it or otherwise

03:02.580 --> 03:06.940
deface it, filmmakers will often use real money just for simplicity's sake.

03:06.940 --> 03:11.300
Some prop manufacturers will create a stack of blank green paper then top it with one

03:11.300 --> 03:15.200
real bill to give the appearance of stacks of currency.

03:15.200 --> 03:20.240
In conclusion, don't mess around with counterfeit, it will almost never end well.

03:20.240 --> 03:21.480
Thank you for watching.

03:21.480 --> 03:25.080
Sorry for the short episode, but I wanted to get something out this week.

03:25.080 --> 03:28.900
Right now I'm working on three or four videos that I'm very excited about, to be released

03:28.900 --> 03:32.880
in the coming weeks and months, so make sure to click subscribe to catch those.

03:32.880 --> 03:36.600
