0	2120	Hello, I'm Sam.
2120	18180	This is my channel, this is that Wikipedia list, and this is that Wikipedia list.
18180	19680	You can't copy money.
19680	21540	I don't mean it's illegal, that's obvious.
21540	25820	I mean that you physically cannot copy money on a photocopier.
25820	31140	This is probably the only thing in the world that your copier will simply refuse to copy.
31140	35500	With pretty much any modern copier, an error message will come up if you put a banknote
35500	38140	or something resembling a banknote in the scanner.
38140	41540	I'd tell you to try it, but there are so many laws surrounding currency that I'm
41540	45040	pretty sure I'd have the police kicking down my door tomorrow if I did.
45040	46460	You can just take my word for it.
46460	50280	It's pretty interesting how money is detected by photocopiers.
50280	55020	For almost any major currency, there's one symbol that tells machines that what they're
55020	56180	seeing is money.
56180	59860	It's called the Eurion constellation and it looks like this.
59860	63940	It was first discovered on the 10 euro note in this cluster of circles, but has since
63940	70700	been found on the American dollar, the Swedish krona, the UK pound, and pretty much every
70700	72780	other major currency.
72780	77940	Most photocopiers will, if they see this pattern of dots, stop printing in an attempt to stop
77940	78940	counterfeit.
78940	81400	At least, that's how it used to be.
81400	85840	More recently, copiers have moved to a system called the counterfeit deterrent system which
85840	88960	is incredibly secretive and effective.
88960	93000	Nobody is really sure how it works, and while the Eurion constellation might be part of
93000	97320	it, these security measures make it even more difficult to copy banknotes.
97320	102360	Adobe Photoshop, like most photo editing softwares, has the counterfeit deterrent system built
102360	105480	in, which lets you see just how well it works.
105480	109820	Photoshop can of course detect this image of a 10 pound note since its Eurion constellations
109820	114740	are clearly visible, but then it can also detect it if the area is blacked out.
114740	119340	It can even figure out that this tiny, almost completely blacked out image is part of a
119340	122220	US $20 bill and refuse to edit it.
122220	127120	There's a ton of different laws relating to the duplication and publication of visuals
127120	128380	of currency.
128380	132660	The US has 32 pages of laws related to currency.
132660	137260	Along with the obvious illegality of counterfeit, it's also illegal in the US to print or
137260	142700	publish any illustration of currency, postage stamps, or revenue stamps of any nation in
142700	147380	the world unless, of course, it's a stamp made under the Migratory Bird Hunting Stamp
147380	151420	Act of 1934 and no, that's not a joke.
151420	156260	It's also illegal to deface currency in any way or to use the image of currency in
156260	157260	any advertisement.
157260	162760	It is, however, legal to show authentic banknotes in videos and films.
162760	167020	For this reason, in most cases, the money used in movies is real.
167020	173340	To legally create prop money, the bill has to be less than 75% or more than 150% of the
173340	179480	size of authentic currency, one sided, and must be destroyed immediately after use.
179480	182580	Unless they want to do something that's illegal with money, like burn it or otherwise
182580	186940	deface it, filmmakers will often use real money just for simplicity's sake.
186940	191300	Some prop manufacturers will create a stack of blank green paper then top it with one
191300	195200	real bill to give the appearance of stacks of currency.
195200	200240	In conclusion, don't mess around with counterfeit, it will almost never end well.
200240	201480	Thank you for watching.
201480	205080	Sorry for the short episode, but I wanted to get something out this week.
205080	208900	Right now I'm working on three or four videos that I'm very excited about, to be released
208900	212880	in the coming weeks and months, so make sure to click subscribe to catch those.
212880	216600	You can also follow me on Twitter at WendoverPro for updates along the way.
