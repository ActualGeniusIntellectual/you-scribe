Hello, I'm Sam.

2
00:00:02,120 --> 00:00:18,180
This is my channel, this is that Wikipedia list, and this is that Wikipedia list.

3
00:00:18,180 --> 00:00:19,680
You can't copy money.

4
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:21,540
I don't mean it's illegal, that's obvious.

5
00:00:21,540 --> 00:00:25,820
I mean that you physically cannot copy money on a photocopier.

6
00:00:25,820 --> 00:00:31,140
This is probably the only thing in the world that your copier will simply refuse to copy.

7
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:35,500
With pretty much any modern copier, an error message will come up if you put a banknote

8
00:00:35,500 --> 00:00:38,140
or something resembling a banknote in the scanner.

9
00:00:38,140 --> 00:00:41,540
I'd tell you to try it, but there are so many laws surrounding currency that I'm

10
00:00:41,540 --> 00:00:45,040
pretty sure I'd have the police kicking down my door tomorrow if I did.

11
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:46,460
You can just take my word for it.

12
00:00:46,460 --> 00:00:50,280
It's pretty interesting how money is detected by photocopiers.

13
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:55,020
For almost any major currency, there's one symbol that tells machines that what they're

14
00:00:55,020 --> 00:00:56,180
seeing is money.

15
00:00:56,180 --> 00:00:59,860
It's called the Eurion constellation and it looks like this.

16
00:00:59,860 --> 00:01:03,940
It was first discovered on the 10 euro note in this cluster of circles, but has since

17
00:01:03,940 --> 00:01:10,700
been found on the American dollar, the Swedish krona, the UK pound, and pretty much every

18
00:01:10,700 --> 00:01:12,780
other major currency.

19
00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:17,940
Most photocopiers will, if they see this pattern of dots, stop printing in an attempt to stop

20
00:01:17,940 --> 00:01:18,940
counterfeit.

21
00:01:18,940 --> 00:01:21,400
At least, that's how it used to be.

22
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:25,840
More recently, copiers have moved to a system called the counterfeit deterrent system which

23
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:28,960
is incredibly secretive and effective.

24
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:33,000
Nobody is really sure how it works, and while the Eurion constellation might be part of

25
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:37,320
it, these security measures make it even more difficult to copy banknotes.

26
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:42,360
Adobe Photoshop, like most photo editing softwares, has the counterfeit deterrent system built

27
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:45,480
in, which lets you see just how well it works.

28
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:49,820
Photoshop can of course detect this image of a 10 pound note since its Eurion constellations

29
00:01:49,820 --> 00:01:54,740
are clearly visible, but then it can also detect it if the area is blacked out.

30
00:01:54,740 --> 00:01:59,340
It can even figure out that this tiny, almost completely blacked out image is part of a

31
00:01:59,340 --> 00:02:02,220
US $20 bill and refuse to edit it.

32
00:02:02,220 --> 00:02:07,120
There's a ton of different laws relating to the duplication and publication of visuals

33
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:08,380
of currency.

34
00:02:08,380 --> 00:02:12,660
The US has 32 pages of laws related to currency.

35
00:02:12,660 --> 00:02:17,260
Along with the obvious illegality of counterfeit, it's also illegal in the US to print or

36
00:02:17,260 --> 00:02:22,700
publish any illustration of currency, postage stamps, or revenue stamps of any nation in

37
00:02:22,700 --> 00:02:27,380
the world unless, of course, it's a stamp made under the Migratory Bird Hunting Stamp

38
00:02:27,380 --> 00:02:31,420
Act of 1934 and no, that's not a joke.

39
00:02:31,420 --> 00:02:36,260
It's also illegal to deface currency in any way or to use the image of currency in

40
00:02:36,260 --> 00:02:37,260
any advertisement.

41
00:02:37,260 --> 00:02:42,760
It is, however, legal to show authentic banknotes in videos and films.

42
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:47,020
For this reason, in most cases, the money used in movies is real.

43
00:02:47,020 --> 00:02:53,340
To legally create prop money, the bill has to be less than 75% or more than 150% of the

44
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:59,480
size of authentic currency, one sided, and must be destroyed immediately after use.

45
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:02,580
Unless they want to do something that's illegal with money, like burn it or otherwise

46
00:03:02,580 --> 00:03:06,940
deface it, filmmakers will often use real money just for simplicity's sake.

47
00:03:06,940 --> 00:03:11,300
Some prop manufacturers will create a stack of blank green paper then top it with one

48
00:03:11,300 --> 00:03:15,200
real bill to give the appearance of stacks of currency.

49
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:20,240
In conclusion, don't mess around with counterfeit, it will almost never end well.

50
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:21,480
Thank you for watching.

51
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:25,080
Sorry for the short episode, but I wanted to get something out this week.

52
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:28,900
Right now I'm working on three or four videos that I'm very excited about, to be released

53
00:03:28,900 --> 00:03:32,880
in the coming weeks and months, so make sure to click subscribe to catch those.

54
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:36,600
