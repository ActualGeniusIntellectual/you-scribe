00:00.000 --> 00:08.640
TWL is backâ€¦ kinda, and not here.

00:08.640 --> 00:12.600
As of today, there's a brand new channel by Wendover Productions and it's called

00:12.600 --> 00:14.320
Half as Interesting.

00:14.320 --> 00:18.240
The videos are about half as long and probably about half as good as the ones here.

00:18.240 --> 00:22.480
It's essentially the continuation of the old TWL series without the restriction of

00:22.480 --> 00:24.840
only picking topics from that Wikipedia list.

00:24.840 --> 00:29.480
There's no more waiting because the first video is up now and it's about what's

00:29.480 --> 00:32.320
the longest drivable distance on earth.

00:32.320 --> 00:37.200
Videos will be going up there weekly every Thursday at 10.30 am eastern.

00:37.200 --> 00:41.280
Wendover Productions will remain just as it always has, the only difference is that you

00:41.280 --> 00:44.960
can go listen to more and more of this voice over there.

00:44.960 --> 00:48.400
I'd really appreciate it if you go over there and subscribe to at least give it a

00:48.400 --> 00:49.600
try for a few episodes.

00:49.600 --> 00:54.080
I've been putting a lot of work into developing that channel and hopefully it will end up

00:54.080 --> 00:55.280
being something great.

00:59.480 --> 01:01.480
I'll see you next time.
