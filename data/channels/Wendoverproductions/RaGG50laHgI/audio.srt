00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,640
TWL is backâ€¦ kinda, and not here.

2
00:00:08,640 --> 00:00:12,600
As of today, there's a brand new channel by Wendover Productions and it's called

3
00:00:12,600 --> 00:00:14,320
Half as Interesting.

4
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:18,240
The videos are about half as long and probably about half as good as the ones here.

5
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:22,480
It's essentially the continuation of the old TWL series without the restriction of

6
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:24,840
only picking topics from that Wikipedia list.

7
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:29,480
There's no more waiting because the first video is up now and it's about what's

8
00:00:29,480 --> 00:00:32,320
the longest drivable distance on earth.

9
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:37,200
Videos will be going up there weekly every Thursday at 10.30 am eastern.

10
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:41,280
Wendover Productions will remain just as it always has, the only difference is that you

11
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:44,960
can go listen to more and more of this voice over there.

12
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:48,400
I'd really appreciate it if you go over there and subscribe to at least give it a

13
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:49,600
try for a few episodes.

14
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:54,080
I've been putting a lot of work into developing that channel and hopefully it will end up

15
00:00:54,080 --> 00:00:55,280
being something great.

16
00:00:59,480 --> 00:01:01,480
I'll see you next time.
