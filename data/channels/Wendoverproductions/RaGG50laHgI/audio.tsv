0	8640	TWL is backâ€¦ kinda, and not here.
8640	12600	As of today, there's a brand new channel by Wendover Productions and it's called
12600	14320	Half as Interesting.
14320	18240	The videos are about half as long and probably about half as good as the ones here.
18240	22480	It's essentially the continuation of the old TWL series without the restriction of
22480	24840	only picking topics from that Wikipedia list.
24840	29480	There's no more waiting because the first video is up now and it's about what's
29480	32320	the longest drivable distance on earth.
32320	37200	Videos will be going up there weekly every Thursday at 10.30 am eastern.
37200	41280	Wendover Productions will remain just as it always has, the only difference is that you
41280	44960	can go listen to more and more of this voice over there.
44960	48400	I'd really appreciate it if you go over there and subscribe to at least give it a
48400	49600	try for a few episodes.
49600	54080	I've been putting a lot of work into developing that channel and hopefully it will end up
54080	55280	being something great.
59480	61480	I'll see you next time.
