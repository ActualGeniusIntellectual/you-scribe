14720	18760	Before I start, I want to quickly mention that I started a podcast with Brian from Real
18760	20600	Engineering called Showmakers.
20600	24560	In the very first episode, which is out now, we chat with none other than Hank Green.
24560	29560	I'd really appreciate it if you give it a try and the link is down in the description.
29920	31440	Trains are expensive.
31440	36080	So expensive, in fact, that on three of the most traveled routes in three countries—New
36080	42000	York to Washington in the US, Edinburgh to London in the UK, and Paris to Lyon in France—they're
42000	44280	pretty much the same price as the plane.
44280	50240	These routes start at $49, 30 pounds, and 30 euros respectively on the train and $52,
50240	53720	13 pounds, and 53 euros on the plane.
53720	57840	On a longer route like New York to Chicago, the difference is even more pronounced.
57840	62000	$59 for the plane, $108 for the train.
62000	66320	And that's keeping in mind that trains are subsidized or government run in almost every
66320	70880	country while airlines are highly profitable commercial enterprises.
70880	76500	The planes flying between DC and New York are $49 million machines while the trains
76500	80260	traveling the route cost no more than $10 million total.
80260	85940	The plane has to burn 1.7 gallons of fuel per mile flown while the train relies on clean
85940	87240	electric power.
87240	91200	All this therefore begs the question, why are trains so expensive?
91200	97120	Now, I mentioned that fares between DC and New York start at $49, but that's far from
97120	98760	the average price—$73.
98760	102760	Let's look at the expenses that go into that fare.
102760	106960	The single largest expense for Amtrak is staffing.
106960	110400	Trains require a lot of people to operate.
110400	117040	85,000 passengers journey on Amtrak daily, but for that Amtrak employs 20,000 people.
117480	122800	Meaning that, daily, Amtrak requires one employee for every four passengers.
122800	127820	On top of that, the majority of those working for Amtrak are highly specialized, unionized
127820	130600	workers who demand high salaries.
130600	136440	Amtrak's financial reports tell us that they spend $105,000 per employee, but that's
136440	139680	not to say that everyone at Amtrak is making six figures.
139680	145720	Taxes and benefits typically cost an employer 30-40% of a salary so the actual average salary
145720	149360	for an Amtrak employee is around $75,000.
149360	154640	These salary costs are so high that they account for over a third of the ticket price between
154640	158620	DC and New York—$25.82 total.
158620	164480	The cost of employees is so high for train operators largely because trains are so slow.
164480	169120	For a flight from DC to New York, an airline would only have to pay employees for an hour
169120	173780	of work while Amtrak has to pay their employees for three and a half hours of work.
173780	177900	The difference is even more striking on the long-haul routes—Chicago to Los Angeles,
177900	178900	for example.
178900	184100	An airline would have to pay for four hours of work while Amtrak pays for 44 hours of
184100	185100	work.
185100	190740	In addition, trains have physical infrastructure to maintain along the journey—the rails.
190740	195260	Airlines also have infrastructure to pay for on each end—the airports—but between those
195260	197680	they just use the sky, which is free.
197680	204900	Amtrak only owns 730 miles of those 21,000 miles of track they use, but they still indirectly
204900	210020	pay for the employees who maintain those 20,000 miles of rented track through the fees charged
210020	212200	by the track owners for their use.
212200	216320	The next largest cost for train operators is that of the trains themselves.
216320	220480	Trains aren't that expensive compared to airplanes, but they still cost millions of
220480	221480	dollars.
221480	226440	The locomotive pulling the train from DC to New York costs $6.5 million and then each
226440	230640	one of the passenger cars costs an additional $400,000.
230640	237020	With a seven car train, that works out to $9.4 million which accounts for $9.67 on this
237020	238500	particular ticket.
238500	245720	The other part of infrastructure, rails, costs Amtrak an additional $3.66 on this ticket.
245720	250480	Railroad tracks are extraordinarily expensive to build, typically more than $1 million per
250480	255980	mile, but on routes like DC to New York they're just used so much that the per train or per
256020	258700	ticket cost is negligible.
258700	262420	Amtrak is a business so it also needs to pay to run the business.
262420	269580	$2.15 of this ticket goes to administrative costs and then another $1.31 to advertising.
269580	274420	Moving on, trains are extremely safe compared to cars, but you're still more than three
274420	278740	times as likely to be killed on or by a train than a plane.
278740	282260	Trains do occasionally crash and they also crash into people.
282260	287180	When this happens, Amtrak often has to pay a settlement to the victims and the fees associated
287180	291560	with that account for $0.79 on the DC to New York ticket.
291560	296060	That does mean that when traveling between DC and New York, in essence, you're paying
296060	300020	$0.79 in order for Amtrak to kill or injure people.
300020	305380	Those were all the major costs to run a train, but there's still another $5.91 on that
305380	308780	ticket that just represents other minor costs.
308820	314020	So, the total expense for Amtrak to run that train is $50.14.
314020	318260	The remaining $22.86 is pure profit.
318260	323300	You see, the train from DC to New York, the Northeast Regional, is one of the few Amtrak
323300	324980	routes to make a profit.
324980	330700	The demand, speed, and frequency of the train helps it succeed financially where other routes
330700	331700	fail.
331700	336740	Per passenger per mile, Amtrak makes 8 cents of profit on the Northeast Regional, the low
336740	342620	speed train, and 29 cents per passenger mile on the Acela Express, the high speed train.
342620	347380	These profitable routes help pay for Amtrak's unprofitable routes and there are a lot of
347380	348380	them.
348380	353020	Some routes, like the Sunset Limited between New Orleans and Los Angeles, lose as many
353020	359780	as 21.7 cents per passenger per mile and when passengers can travel 2,000 miles on that
359780	361820	route, that's a lot of loss.
361820	367500	As I mentioned, that $49 fare is not the average ticket price to travel between DC and New
367500	368500	York.
368500	373080	The $49 fare is the price at which Amtrak starts selling tickets, but as the date of
373080	377020	travel nears, the price can increase to hundreds of dollars.
377020	381140	That might seem like price gouging, but it's actually a way to make sure everyone can afford
381140	382140	a ticket.
382140	385760	That's not to say Amtrak and other train companies are these altruistic organizations
385760	387880	trying to bring travel to the masses.
387880	389760	It just makes more money.
389760	393880	Especially with trains where it costs the operator roughly the same to transport five
393880	399540	passengers as it does to transport 500, the operator always wants to have as many seats
399540	402560	as possible filled even if that means selling cheap tickets.
402560	406720	In a perfect world for the operator, they could ask every potential passenger what the
406720	410020	maximum amount they'd be willing to pay for the journey is.
410020	415000	If they adapt the ticket price to every passenger's maximum price then they can fill each seat
415000	417960	with passengers paying the highest possible amount.
417960	422960	However, in practice, nobody would ever answer the question truthfully so it would never
422960	423960	work.
423960	428140	Ticketing systems, however, try to ask this question subliminally.
428140	432960	Going back to that route from Edinburgh to London, the operator, Virgin Trains East Coast,
432960	437580	sells three types of tickets—advance, off-peak, and anytime.
437580	442760	The advance tickets range anywhere from 30 pounds to 140 pounds, the off-peak fares cost
442760	448400	137 pounds, and the anytime fares cost 148.5 pounds.
448400	452620	For the advance fares, there are a certain unknown number of tickets at different price
452620	455800	levels on sale and once they're gone, they're gone.
455800	460120	For example, there might be 15 tickets at 30 pounds and once they're sold, the price
460120	465760	increases to 35, then 40, 45, and so on and so forth.
465760	468800	That encourages those who can buy early to buy early.
468800	471200	Normally, that means tourists.
471200	475240	Travelers tend to plan far in advance and are more budget conscious since they're
475240	476560	paying for their own costs.
476560	480800	They're also more likely to travel down to London on the often cheaper plane since
480800	483880	they're less attracted by the convenience of the train.
483880	488640	These advance fares are only valid for the exact route, day, and time bought which is
488640	493860	fine for leisure travelers, but business travelers typically want more flexibility.
493860	497580	Buying advance fares often doesn't work for business travelers since their plans are
497580	502620	only made a few weeks or days in advance and, since they don't personally pay for
502620	507140	their tickets, it's no problem for them to pay for the convenience of taking the train
507140	508380	on a flexible ticket.
508380	513180	That's why they often pay 148.5 pounds for an anytime ticket.
513180	515740	With these, you can just hop on a train whenever.
515740	519100	It doesn't matter if it's in ten minutes or ten days.
519100	521280	You just step on the train and take a seat.
521280	525380	The middle ground between those two is the off-peak single which lets you take any train
525380	529460	that arrives in London after 11.17 am or is on the weekend.
529460	533940	These fares are still geared towards business travelers but by restricting against the early
533940	539560	morning trains, they give a discount for those who can avoid the busiest morning trains.
539560	542780	For each of these fares there are equivalents in first class.
542780	547640	On top of that, young, disabled, and elderly people get up to one third off their fares
547640	549000	with a railcard.
549000	553220	That all means that there are essentially twelve different types of tickets for sale
553220	557220	and that one person heading to London might be paying 20 pounds while the person sitting
557220	561980	right next to them is paying 200, but what they're really paying for is convenience.
561980	568140	Now, back in the US, if Amtrak only operated profitable routes, their route map would look
568140	572260	like this, but the routes that don't make money are the ones that really matter.
572260	578380	Amtrak serves over 500 destinations in 46 states, many of which are small towns with
578380	581020	no other means of public transportation.
581020	585320	While trains are normally the more expensive means of transport, they are less expensive
585320	588080	than planes to service small communities.
588080	593600	The small airports in the rural parts of America are extraordinarily expensive to operate.
593600	597580	Even if there are just two or three flights a day, they still need a runway, terminal,
597580	602960	security, and air traffic control while a rural train station needs barely any infrastructure
602960	604420	or maintenance.
604420	610300	In fact, it's cheaper to fly from Chicago to London than it is to fly from Haver, Montana
610300	615740	to Chicago whereas Amtrak brings passengers from Haver to Chicago for only a few hundred
615740	621780	dollars—much more in budget for the average resident of Haver who makes only $22,000 per
621780	622780	year.
622780	626860	Of course this is a political issue, but a part of why trains are so expensive is to
626860	632140	allow train operators to fulfill obligations to serve small communities who need solid
632140	633460	transport links.
633460	638580	Research has shown that ease of access to transport has a stronger influence on whether
638580	642580	someone will earn more than their parents did, than the level of crime in their area,
642580	647420	or whether they grew up in a two-parent household and so keeping trains running through rural
647420	650100	America is incredibly important.
650100	656260	Next time you take the train from DC to New York, just keep in mind that that $22.86 a
656260	660940	profit goes to making sure that someone from Haver can get to Chicago for less than you
660940	667620	can fly to Europe.
667660	668780	So you see this number?
668780	673540	That's how much these last few seconds would cost if I were buying footage from a traditional
673540	675100	stock footage provider.
675100	680220	Luckily, I get my footage from Videoblocks where with their membership you can use as
680220	685700	many of the 115,000 clips in their unlimited library as you want.
685700	691460	Since I started Wendover Productions, I've used 686 clips from Videoblocks.
691460	695660	Almost every piece of footage you see in my videos is from them and that means I've
695660	701980	saved $54,194 with my Videoblocks subscription.
701980	705900	Without Videoblocks, there's no way that my videos would look as professional.
705900	710100	I simply would not be able to afford it and whether you already have a YouTube channel
710100	714940	or plan to start one, Videoblocks will do amazing things for your production value.
714940	719180	I can honestly say that it's one of the best purchases I've ever made and I've
719180	721340	used Videoblocks since day one.
