00:14.720 --> 00:18.760
Before I start, I want to quickly mention that I started a podcast with Brian from Real

00:18.760 --> 00:20.600
Engineering called Showmakers.

00:20.600 --> 00:24.560
In the very first episode, which is out now, we chat with none other than Hank Green.

00:24.560 --> 00:29.560
I'd really appreciate it if you give it a try and the link is down in the description.

00:29.920 --> 00:31.440
Trains are expensive.

00:31.440 --> 00:36.080
So expensive, in fact, that on three of the most traveled routes in three countries—New

00:36.080 --> 00:42.000
York to Washington in the US, Edinburgh to London in the UK, and Paris to Lyon in France—they're

00:42.000 --> 00:44.280
pretty much the same price as the plane.

00:44.280 --> 00:50.240
These routes start at $49, 30 pounds, and 30 euros respectively on the train and $52,

00:50.240 --> 00:53.720
13 pounds, and 53 euros on the plane.

00:53.720 --> 00:57.840
On a longer route like New York to Chicago, the difference is even more pronounced.

00:57.840 --> 01:02.000
$59 for the plane, $108 for the train.

01:02.000 --> 01:06.320
And that's keeping in mind that trains are subsidized or government run in almost every

01:06.320 --> 01:10.880
country while airlines are highly profitable commercial enterprises.

01:10.880 --> 01:16.500
The planes flying between DC and New York are $49 million machines while the trains

01:16.500 --> 01:20.260
traveling the route cost no more than $10 million total.

01:20.260 --> 01:25.940
The plane has to burn 1.7 gallons of fuel per mile flown while the train relies on clean

01:25.940 --> 01:27.240
electric power.

01:27.240 --> 01:31.200
All this therefore begs the question, why are trains so expensive?

01:31.200 --> 01:37.120
Now, I mentioned that fares between DC and New York start at $49, but that's far from

01:37.120 --> 01:38.760
the average price—$73.

01:38.760 --> 01:42.760
Let's look at the expenses that go into that fare.

01:42.760 --> 01:46.960
The single largest expense for Amtrak is staffing.

01:46.960 --> 01:50.400
Trains require a lot of people to operate.

01:50.400 --> 01:57.040
85,000 passengers journey on Amtrak daily, but for that Amtrak employs 20,000 people.

01:57.480 --> 02:02.800
Meaning that, daily, Amtrak requires one employee for every four passengers.

02:02.800 --> 02:07.820
On top of that, the majority of those working for Amtrak are highly specialized, unionized

02:07.820 --> 02:10.600
workers who demand high salaries.

02:10.600 --> 02:16.440
Amtrak's financial reports tell us that they spend $105,000 per employee, but that's

02:16.440 --> 02:19.680
not to say that everyone at Amtrak is making six figures.

02:19.680 --> 02:25.720
Taxes and benefits typically cost an employer 30-40% of a salary so the actual average salary

02:25.720 --> 02:29.360
for an Amtrak employee is around $75,000.

02:29.360 --> 02:34.640
These salary costs are so high that they account for over a third of the ticket price between

02:34.640 --> 02:38.620
DC and New York—$25.82 total.

02:38.620 --> 02:44.480
The cost of employees is so high for train operators largely because trains are so slow.

02:44.480 --> 02:49.120
For a flight from DC to New York, an airline would only have to pay employees for an hour

02:49.120 --> 02:53.780
of work while Amtrak has to pay their employees for three and a half hours of work.

02:53.780 --> 02:57.900
The difference is even more striking on the long-haul routes—Chicago to Los Angeles,

02:57.900 --> 02:58.900
for example.

02:58.900 --> 03:04.100
An airline would have to pay for four hours of work while Amtrak pays for 44 hours of

03:04.100 --> 03:05.100
work.

03:05.100 --> 03:10.740
In addition, trains have physical infrastructure to maintain along the journey—the rails.

03:10.740 --> 03:15.260
Airlines also have infrastructure to pay for on each end—the airports—but between those

03:15.260 --> 03:17.680
they just use the sky, which is free.

03:17.680 --> 03:24.900
Amtrak only owns 730 miles of those 21,000 miles of track they use, but they still indirectly

03:24.900 --> 03:30.020
pay for the employees who maintain those 20,000 miles of rented track through the fees charged

03:30.020 --> 03:32.200
by the track owners for their use.

03:32.200 --> 03:36.320
The next largest cost for train operators is that of the trains themselves.

03:36.320 --> 03:40.480
Trains aren't that expensive compared to airplanes, but they still cost millions of

03:40.480 --> 03:41.480
dollars.

03:41.480 --> 03:46.440
The locomotive pulling the train from DC to New York costs $6.5 million and then each

03:46.440 --> 03:50.640
one of the passenger cars costs an additional $400,000.

03:50.640 --> 03:57.020
With a seven car train, that works out to $9.4 million which accounts for $9.67 on this

03:57.020 --> 03:58.500
particular ticket.

03:58.500 --> 04:05.720
The other part of infrastructure, rails, costs Amtrak an additional $3.66 on this ticket.

04:05.720 --> 04:10.480
Railroad tracks are extraordinarily expensive to build, typically more than $1 million per

04:10.480 --> 04:15.980
mile, but on routes like DC to New York they're just used so much that the per train or per

04:16.020 --> 04:18.700
ticket cost is negligible.

04:18.700 --> 04:22.420
Amtrak is a business so it also needs to pay to run the business.

04:22.420 --> 04:29.580
$2.15 of this ticket goes to administrative costs and then another $1.31 to advertising.

04:29.580 --> 04:34.420
Moving on, trains are extremely safe compared to cars, but you're still more than three

04:34.420 --> 04:38.740
times as likely to be killed on or by a train than a plane.

04:38.740 --> 04:42.260
Trains do occasionally crash and they also crash into people.

04:42.260 --> 04:47.180
When this happens, Amtrak often has to pay a settlement to the victims and the fees associated

04:47.180 --> 04:51.560
with that account for $0.79 on the DC to New York ticket.

04:51.560 --> 04:56.060
That does mean that when traveling between DC and New York, in essence, you're paying

04:56.060 --> 05:00.020
$0.79 in order for Amtrak to kill or injure people.

05:00.020 --> 05:05.380
Those were all the major costs to run a train, but there's still another $5.91 on that

05:05.380 --> 05:08.780
ticket that just represents other minor costs.

05:08.820 --> 05:14.020
So, the total expense for Amtrak to run that train is $50.14.

05:14.020 --> 05:18.260
The remaining $22.86 is pure profit.

05:18.260 --> 05:23.300
You see, the train from DC to New York, the Northeast Regional, is one of the few Amtrak

05:23.300 --> 05:24.980
routes to make a profit.

05:24.980 --> 05:30.700
The demand, speed, and frequency of the train helps it succeed financially where other routes

05:30.700 --> 05:31.700
fail.

05:31.700 --> 05:36.740
Per passenger per mile, Amtrak makes 8 cents of profit on the Northeast Regional, the low

05:36.740 --> 05:42.620
speed train, and 29 cents per passenger mile on the Acela Express, the high speed train.

05:42.620 --> 05:47.380
These profitable routes help pay for Amtrak's unprofitable routes and there are a lot of

05:47.380 --> 05:48.380
them.

05:48.380 --> 05:53.020
Some routes, like the Sunset Limited between New Orleans and Los Angeles, lose as many

05:53.020 --> 05:59.780
as 21.7 cents per passenger per mile and when passengers can travel 2,000 miles on that

05:59.780 --> 06:01.820
route, that's a lot of loss.

06:01.820 --> 06:07.500
As I mentioned, that $49 fare is not the average ticket price to travel between DC and New

06:07.500 --> 06:08.500
York.

06:08.500 --> 06:13.080
The $49 fare is the price at which Amtrak starts selling tickets, but as the date of

06:13.080 --> 06:17.020
travel nears, the price can increase to hundreds of dollars.

06:17.020 --> 06:21.140
That might seem like price gouging, but it's actually a way to make sure everyone can afford

06:21.140 --> 06:22.140
a ticket.

06:22.140 --> 06:25.760
That's not to say Amtrak and other train companies are these altruistic organizations

06:25.760 --> 06:27.880
trying to bring travel to the masses.

06:27.880 --> 06:29.760
It just makes more money.

06:29.760 --> 06:33.880
Especially with trains where it costs the operator roughly the same to transport five

06:33.880 --> 06:39.540
passengers as it does to transport 500, the operator always wants to have as many seats

06:39.540 --> 06:42.560
as possible filled even if that means selling cheap tickets.

06:42.560 --> 06:46.720
In a perfect world for the operator, they could ask every potential passenger what the

06:46.720 --> 06:50.020
maximum amount they'd be willing to pay for the journey is.

06:50.020 --> 06:55.000
If they adapt the ticket price to every passenger's maximum price then they can fill each seat

06:55.000 --> 06:57.960
with passengers paying the highest possible amount.

06:57.960 --> 07:02.960
However, in practice, nobody would ever answer the question truthfully so it would never

07:02.960 --> 07:03.960
work.

07:03.960 --> 07:08.140
Ticketing systems, however, try to ask this question subliminally.

07:08.140 --> 07:12.960
Going back to that route from Edinburgh to London, the operator, Virgin Trains East Coast,

07:12.960 --> 07:17.580
sells three types of tickets—advance, off-peak, and anytime.

07:17.580 --> 07:22.760
The advance tickets range anywhere from 30 pounds to 140 pounds, the off-peak fares cost

07:22.760 --> 07:28.400
137 pounds, and the anytime fares cost 148.5 pounds.

07:28.400 --> 07:32.620
For the advance fares, there are a certain unknown number of tickets at different price

07:32.620 --> 07:35.800
levels on sale and once they're gone, they're gone.

07:35.800 --> 07:40.120
For example, there might be 15 tickets at 30 pounds and once they're sold, the price

07:40.120 --> 07:45.760
increases to 35, then 40, 45, and so on and so forth.

07:45.760 --> 07:48.800
That encourages those who can buy early to buy early.

07:48.800 --> 07:51.200
Normally, that means tourists.

07:51.200 --> 07:55.240
Travelers tend to plan far in advance and are more budget conscious since they're

07:55.240 --> 07:56.560
paying for their own costs.

07:56.560 --> 08:00.800
They're also more likely to travel down to London on the often cheaper plane since

08:00.800 --> 08:03.880
they're less attracted by the convenience of the train.

08:03.880 --> 08:08.640
These advance fares are only valid for the exact route, day, and time bought which is

08:08.640 --> 08:13.860
fine for leisure travelers, but business travelers typically want more flexibility.

08:13.860 --> 08:17.580
Buying advance fares often doesn't work for business travelers since their plans are

08:17.580 --> 08:22.620
only made a few weeks or days in advance and, since they don't personally pay for

08:22.620 --> 08:27.140
their tickets, it's no problem for them to pay for the convenience of taking the train

08:27.140 --> 08:28.380
on a flexible ticket.

08:28.380 --> 08:33.180
That's why they often pay 148.5 pounds for an anytime ticket.

08:33.180 --> 08:35.740
With these, you can just hop on a train whenever.

08:35.740 --> 08:39.100
It doesn't matter if it's in ten minutes or ten days.

08:39.100 --> 08:41.280
You just step on the train and take a seat.

08:41.280 --> 08:45.380
The middle ground between those two is the off-peak single which lets you take any train

08:45.380 --> 08:49.460
that arrives in London after 11.17 am or is on the weekend.

08:49.460 --> 08:53.940
These fares are still geared towards business travelers but by restricting against the early

08:53.940 --> 08:59.560
morning trains, they give a discount for those who can avoid the busiest morning trains.

08:59.560 --> 09:02.780
For each of these fares there are equivalents in first class.

09:02.780 --> 09:07.640
On top of that, young, disabled, and elderly people get up to one third off their fares

09:07.640 --> 09:09.000
with a railcard.

09:09.000 --> 09:13.220
That all means that there are essentially twelve different types of tickets for sale

09:13.220 --> 09:17.220
and that one person heading to London might be paying 20 pounds while the person sitting

09:17.220 --> 09:21.980
right next to them is paying 200, but what they're really paying for is convenience.

09:21.980 --> 09:28.140
Now, back in the US, if Amtrak only operated profitable routes, their route map would look

09:28.140 --> 09:32.260
like this, but the routes that don't make money are the ones that really matter.

09:32.260 --> 09:38.380
Amtrak serves over 500 destinations in 46 states, many of which are small towns with

09:38.380 --> 09:41.020
no other means of public transportation.

09:41.020 --> 09:45.320
While trains are normally the more expensive means of transport, they are less expensive

09:45.320 --> 09:48.080
than planes to service small communities.

09:48.080 --> 09:53.600
The small airports in the rural parts of America are extraordinarily expensive to operate.

09:53.600 --> 09:57.580
Even if there are just two or three flights a day, they still need a runway, terminal,

09:57.580 --> 10:02.960
security, and air traffic control while a rural train station needs barely any infrastructure

10:02.960 --> 10:04.420
or maintenance.

10:04.420 --> 10:10.300
In fact, it's cheaper to fly from Chicago to London than it is to fly from Haver, Montana

10:10.300 --> 10:15.740
to Chicago whereas Amtrak brings passengers from Haver to Chicago for only a few hundred

10:15.740 --> 10:21.780
dollars—much more in budget for the average resident of Haver who makes only $22,000 per

10:21.780 --> 10:22.780
year.

10:22.780 --> 10:26.860
Of course this is a political issue, but a part of why trains are so expensive is to

10:26.860 --> 10:32.140
allow train operators to fulfill obligations to serve small communities who need solid

10:32.140 --> 10:33.460
transport links.

10:33.460 --> 10:38.580
Research has shown that ease of access to transport has a stronger influence on whether

10:38.580 --> 10:42.580
someone will earn more than their parents did, than the level of crime in their area,

10:42.580 --> 10:47.420
or whether they grew up in a two-parent household and so keeping trains running through rural

10:47.420 --> 10:50.100
America is incredibly important.

10:50.100 --> 10:56.260
Next time you take the train from DC to New York, just keep in mind that that $22.86 a

10:56.260 --> 11:00.940
profit goes to making sure that someone from Haver can get to Chicago for less than you

11:00.940 --> 11:07.620
can fly to Europe.

11:07.660 --> 11:08.780
So you see this number?

11:08.780 --> 11:13.540
That's how much these last few seconds would cost if I were buying footage from a traditional

11:13.540 --> 11:15.100
stock footage provider.

11:15.100 --> 11:20.220
Luckily, I get my footage from Videoblocks where with their membership you can use as

11:20.220 --> 11:25.700
many of the 115,000 clips in their unlimited library as you want.

11:25.700 --> 11:31.460
Since I started Wendover Productions, I've used 686 clips from Videoblocks.

11:31.460 --> 11:35.660
Almost every piece of footage you see in my videos is from them and that means I've

11:35.660 --> 11:41.980
saved $54,194 with my Videoblocks subscription.

11:41.980 --> 11:45.900
Without Videoblocks, there's no way that my videos would look as professional.

11:45.900 --> 11:50.100
I simply would not be able to afford it and whether you already have a YouTube channel

11:50.100 --> 11:54.940
or plan to start one, Videoblocks will do amazing things for your production value.

11:54.940 --> 11:59.180
I can honestly say that it's one of the best purchases I've ever made and I've

11:59.180 --> 12:01.340
used Videoblocks since day one.

12:01.340 --> 12:06.860
You can try out Videoblocks exclusively for seven days with the link videoblocks.com slash

12:06.860 --> 12:07.860
