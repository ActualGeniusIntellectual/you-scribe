00:00:14,720 --> 00:00:18,760
Before I start, I want to quickly mention that I started a podcast with Brian from Real

5
00:00:18,760 --> 00:00:20,600
Engineering called Showmakers.

6
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:24,560
In the very first episode, which is out now, we chat with none other than Hank Green.

7
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:29,560
I'd really appreciate it if you give it a try and the link is down in the description.

8
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:31,440
Trains are expensive.

9
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:36,080
So expensive, in fact, that on three of the most traveled routes in three countries—New

10
00:00:36,080 --> 00:00:42,000
York to Washington in the US, Edinburgh to London in the UK, and Paris to Lyon in France—they're

11
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,280
pretty much the same price as the plane.

12
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:50,240
These routes start at $49, 30 pounds, and 30 euros respectively on the train and $52,

13
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:53,720
13 pounds, and 53 euros on the plane.

14
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:57,840
On a longer route like New York to Chicago, the difference is even more pronounced.

15
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:02,000
$59 for the plane, $108 for the train.

16
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:06,320
And that's keeping in mind that trains are subsidized or government run in almost every

17
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:10,880
country while airlines are highly profitable commercial enterprises.

18
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:16,500
The planes flying between DC and New York are $49 million machines while the trains

19
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:20,260
traveling the route cost no more than $10 million total.

20
00:01:20,260 --> 00:01:25,940
The plane has to burn 1.7 gallons of fuel per mile flown while the train relies on clean

21
00:01:25,940 --> 00:01:27,240
electric power.

22
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:31,200
All this therefore begs the question, why are trains so expensive?

23
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:37,120
Now, I mentioned that fares between DC and New York start at $49, but that's far from

24
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:38,760
the average price—$73.

25
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:42,760
Let's look at the expenses that go into that fare.

26
00:01:42,760 --> 00:01:46,960
The single largest expense for Amtrak is staffing.

27
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:50,400
Trains require a lot of people to operate.

28
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:57,040
85,000 passengers journey on Amtrak daily, but for that Amtrak employs 20,000 people.

29
00:01:57,480 --> 00:02:02,800
Meaning that, daily, Amtrak requires one employee for every four passengers.

30
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:07,820
On top of that, the majority of those working for Amtrak are highly specialized, unionized

31
00:02:07,820 --> 00:02:10,600
workers who demand high salaries.

32
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:16,440
Amtrak's financial reports tell us that they spend $105,000 per employee, but that's

33
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:19,680
not to say that everyone at Amtrak is making six figures.

34
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:25,720
Taxes and benefits typically cost an employer 30-40% of a salary so the actual average salary

35
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:29,360
for an Amtrak employee is around $75,000.

36
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:34,640
These salary costs are so high that they account for over a third of the ticket price between

37
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:38,620
DC and New York—$25.82 total.

38
00:02:38,620 --> 00:02:44,480
The cost of employees is so high for train operators largely because trains are so slow.

39
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:49,120
For a flight from DC to New York, an airline would only have to pay employees for an hour

40
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:53,780
of work while Amtrak has to pay their employees for three and a half hours of work.

41
00:02:53,780 --> 00:02:57,900
The difference is even more striking on the long-haul routes—Chicago to Los Angeles,

42
00:02:57,900 --> 00:02:58,900
for example.

43
00:02:58,900 --> 00:03:04,100
An airline would have to pay for four hours of work while Amtrak pays for 44 hours of

44
00:03:04,100 --> 00:03:05,100
work.

45
00:03:05,100 --> 00:03:10,740
In addition, trains have physical infrastructure to maintain along the journey—the rails.

46
00:03:10,740 --> 00:03:15,260
Airlines also have infrastructure to pay for on each end—the airports—but between those

47
00:03:15,260 --> 00:03:17,680
they just use the sky, which is free.

48
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:24,900
Amtrak only owns 730 miles of those 21,000 miles of track they use, but they still indirectly

49
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:30,020
pay for the employees who maintain those 20,000 miles of rented track through the fees charged

50
00:03:30,020 --> 00:03:32,200
by the track owners for their use.

51
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:36,320
The next largest cost for train operators is that of the trains themselves.

52
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:40,480
Trains aren't that expensive compared to airplanes, but they still cost millions of

53
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:41,480
dollars.

54
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:46,440
The locomotive pulling the train from DC to New York costs $6.5 million and then each

55
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:50,640
one of the passenger cars costs an additional $400,000.

56
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:57,020
With a seven car train, that works out to $9.4 million which accounts for $9.67 on this

57
00:03:57,020 --> 00:03:58,500
particular ticket.

58
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:05,720
The other part of infrastructure, rails, costs Amtrak an additional $3.66 on this ticket.

59
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:10,480
Railroad tracks are extraordinarily expensive to build, typically more than $1 million per

60
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:15,980
mile, but on routes like DC to New York they're just used so much that the per train or per

61
00:04:16,020 --> 00:04:18,700
ticket cost is negligible.

62
00:04:18,700 --> 00:04:22,420
Amtrak is a business so it also needs to pay to run the business.

63
00:04:22,420 --> 00:04:29,580
$2.15 of this ticket goes to administrative costs and then another $1.31 to advertising.

64
00:04:29,580 --> 00:04:34,420
Moving on, trains are extremely safe compared to cars, but you're still more than three

65
00:04:34,420 --> 00:04:38,740
times as likely to be killed on or by a train than a plane.

66
00:04:38,740 --> 00:04:42,260
Trains do occasionally crash and they also crash into people.

67
00:04:42,260 --> 00:04:47,180
When this happens, Amtrak often has to pay a settlement to the victims and the fees associated

68
00:04:47,180 --> 00:04:51,560
with that account for $0.79 on the DC to New York ticket.

69
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:56,060
That does mean that when traveling between DC and New York, in essence, you're paying

70
00:04:56,060 --> 00:05:00,020
$0.79 in order for Amtrak to kill or injure people.

71
00:05:00,020 --> 00:05:05,380
Those were all the major costs to run a train, but there's still another $5.91 on that

72
00:05:05,380 --> 00:05:08,780
ticket that just represents other minor costs.

73
00:05:08,820 --> 00:05:14,020
So, the total expense for Amtrak to run that train is $50.14.

74
00:05:14,020 --> 00:05:18,260
The remaining $22.86 is pure profit.

75
00:05:18,260 --> 00:05:23,300
You see, the train from DC to New York, the Northeast Regional, is one of the few Amtrak

76
00:05:23,300 --> 00:05:24,980
routes to make a profit.

77
00:05:24,980 --> 00:05:30,700
The demand, speed, and frequency of the train helps it succeed financially where other routes

78
00:05:30,700 --> 00:05:31,700
fail.

79
00:05:31,700 --> 00:05:36,740
Per passenger per mile, Amtrak makes 8 cents of profit on the Northeast Regional, the low

80
00:05:36,740 --> 00:05:42,620
speed train, and 29 cents per passenger mile on the Acela Express, the high speed train.

81
00:05:42,620 --> 00:05:47,380
These profitable routes help pay for Amtrak's unprofitable routes and there are a lot of

82
00:05:47,380 --> 00:05:48,380
them.

83
00:05:48,380 --> 00:05:53,020
Some routes, like the Sunset Limited between New Orleans and Los Angeles, lose as many

84
00:05:53,020 --> 00:05:59,780
as 21.7 cents per passenger per mile and when passengers can travel 2,000 miles on that

85
00:05:59,780 --> 00:06:01,820
route, that's a lot of loss.

86
00:06:01,820 --> 00:06:07,500
As I mentioned, that $49 fare is not the average ticket price to travel between DC and New

87
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:08,500
York.

88
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:13,080
The $49 fare is the price at which Amtrak starts selling tickets, but as the date of

89
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:17,020
travel nears, the price can increase to hundreds of dollars.

90
00:06:17,020 --> 00:06:21,140
That might seem like price gouging, but it's actually a way to make sure everyone can afford

91
00:06:21,140 --> 00:06:22,140
a ticket.

92
00:06:22,140 --> 00:06:25,760
That's not to say Amtrak and other train companies are these altruistic organizations

93
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:27,880
trying to bring travel to the masses.

94
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:29,760
It just makes more money.

95
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:33,880
Especially with trains where it costs the operator roughly the same to transport five

96
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:39,540
passengers as it does to transport 500, the operator always wants to have as many seats

97
00:06:39,540 --> 00:06:42,560
as possible filled even if that means selling cheap tickets.

98
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:46,720
In a perfect world for the operator, they could ask every potential passenger what the

99
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:50,020
maximum amount they'd be willing to pay for the journey is.

100
00:06:50,020 --> 00:06:55,000
If they adapt the ticket price to every passenger's maximum price then they can fill each seat

101
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,960
with passengers paying the highest possible amount.

102
00:06:57,960 --> 00:07:02,960
However, in practice, nobody would ever answer the question truthfully so it would never

103
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:03,960
work.

104
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:08,140
Ticketing systems, however, try to ask this question subliminally.

105
00:07:08,140 --> 00:07:12,960
Going back to that route from Edinburgh to London, the operator, Virgin Trains East Coast,

106
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:17,580
sells three types of tickets—advance, off-peak, and anytime.

107
00:07:17,580 --> 00:07:22,760
The advance tickets range anywhere from 30 pounds to 140 pounds, the off-peak fares cost

108
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:28,400
137 pounds, and the anytime fares cost 148.5 pounds.

109
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:32,620
For the advance fares, there are a certain unknown number of tickets at different price

110
00:07:32,620 --> 00:07:35,800
levels on sale and once they're gone, they're gone.

111
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:40,120
For example, there might be 15 tickets at 30 pounds and once they're sold, the price

112
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:45,760
increases to 35, then 40, 45, and so on and so forth.

113
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:48,800
That encourages those who can buy early to buy early.

114
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:51,200
Normally, that means tourists.

115
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:55,240
Travelers tend to plan far in advance and are more budget conscious since they're

116
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:56,560
paying for their own costs.

117
00:07:56,560 --> 00:08:00,800
They're also more likely to travel down to London on the often cheaper plane since

118
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:03,880
they're less attracted by the convenience of the train.

119
00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:08,640
These advance fares are only valid for the exact route, day, and time bought which is

120
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:13,860
fine for leisure travelers, but business travelers typically want more flexibility.

121
00:08:13,860 --> 00:08:17,580
Buying advance fares often doesn't work for business travelers since their plans are

122
00:08:17,580 --> 00:08:22,620
only made a few weeks or days in advance and, since they don't personally pay for

123
00:08:22,620 --> 00:08:27,140
their tickets, it's no problem for them to pay for the convenience of taking the train

124
00:08:27,140 --> 00:08:28,380
on a flexible ticket.

125
00:08:28,380 --> 00:08:33,180
That's why they often pay 148.5 pounds for an anytime ticket.

126
00:08:33,180 --> 00:08:35,740
With these, you can just hop on a train whenever.

127
00:08:35,740 --> 00:08:39,100
It doesn't matter if it's in ten minutes or ten days.

128
00:08:39,100 --> 00:08:41,280
You just step on the train and take a seat.

129
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:45,380
The middle ground between those two is the off-peak single which lets you take any train

130
00:08:45,380 --> 00:08:49,460
that arrives in London after 11.17 am or is on the weekend.

131
00:08:49,460 --> 00:08:53,940
These fares are still geared towards business travelers but by restricting against the early

132
00:08:53,940 --> 00:08:59,560
morning trains, they give a discount for those who can avoid the busiest morning trains.

133
00:08:59,560 --> 00:09:02,780
For each of these fares there are equivalents in first class.

134
00:09:02,780 --> 00:09:07,640
On top of that, young, disabled, and elderly people get up to one third off their fares

135
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:09,000
with a railcard.

136
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:13,220
That all means that there are essentially twelve different types of tickets for sale

137
00:09:13,220 --> 00:09:17,220
and that one person heading to London might be paying 20 pounds while the person sitting

138
00:09:17,220 --> 00:09:21,980
right next to them is paying 200, but what they're really paying for is convenience.

139
00:09:21,980 --> 00:09:28,140
Now, back in the US, if Amtrak only operated profitable routes, their route map would look

140
00:09:28,140 --> 00:09:32,260
like this, but the routes that don't make money are the ones that really matter.

141
00:09:32,260 --> 00:09:38,380
Amtrak serves over 500 destinations in 46 states, many of which are small towns with

142
00:09:38,380 --> 00:09:41,020
no other means of public transportation.

143
00:09:41,020 --> 00:09:45,320
While trains are normally the more expensive means of transport, they are less expensive

144
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:48,080
than planes to service small communities.

145
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:53,600
The small airports in the rural parts of America are extraordinarily expensive to operate.

146
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:57,580
Even if there are just two or three flights a day, they still need a runway, terminal,

147
00:09:57,580 --> 00:10:02,960
security, and air traffic control while a rural train station needs barely any infrastructure

148
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:04,420
or maintenance.

149
00:10:04,420 --> 00:10:10,300
In fact, it's cheaper to fly from Chicago to London than it is to fly from Haver, Montana

150
00:10:10,300 --> 00:10:15,740
to Chicago whereas Amtrak brings passengers from Haver to Chicago for only a few hundred

151
00:10:15,740 --> 00:10:21,780
dollars—much more in budget for the average resident of Haver who makes only $22,000 per

152
00:10:21,780 --> 00:10:22,780
year.

153
00:10:22,780 --> 00:10:26,860
Of course this is a political issue, but a part of why trains are so expensive is to

154
00:10:26,860 --> 00:10:32,140
allow train operators to fulfill obligations to serve small communities who need solid

155
00:10:32,140 --> 00:10:33,460
transport links.

156
00:10:33,460 --> 00:10:38,580
Research has shown that ease of access to transport has a stronger influence on whether

157
00:10:38,580 --> 00:10:42,580
someone will earn more than their parents did, than the level of crime in their area,

158
00:10:42,580 --> 00:10:47,420
or whether they grew up in a two-parent household and so keeping trains running through rural

159
00:10:47,420 --> 00:10:50,100
America is incredibly important.

00:10:50,100 --> 00:10:56,260
Next time you take the train from DC to New York, just keep in mind that that $22.86 a

161
00:10:56,260 --> 00:11:00,940
profit goes to making sure that someone from Haver can get to Chicago for less than you

162
00:11:00,940 --> 00:11:07,620
can fly to Europe.

163
00:11:07,660 --> 00:11:08,780
So you see this number?

164
00:11:08,780 --> 00:11:13,540
That's how much these last few seconds would cost if I were buying footage from a traditional

165
00:11:13,540 --> 00:11:15,100
stock footage provider.

166
00:11:15,100 --> 00:11:20,220
Luckily, I get my footage from Videoblocks where with their membership you can use as

167
00:11:20,220 --> 00:11:25,700
many of the 115,000 clips in their unlimited library as you want.

168
00:11:25,700 --> 00:11:31,460
Since I started Wendover Productions, I've used 686 clips from Videoblocks.

169
00:11:31,460 --> 00:11:35,660
Almost every piece of footage you see in my videos is from them and that means I've

170
00:11:35,660 --> 00:11:41,980
saved $54,194 with my Videoblocks subscription.

171
00:11:41,980 --> 00:11:45,900
Without Videoblocks, there's no way that my videos would look as professional.

172
00:11:45,900 --> 00:11:50,100
I simply would not be able to afford it and whether you already have a YouTube channel

173
00:11:50,100 --> 00:11:54,940
or plan to start one, Videoblocks will do amazing things for your production value.

174
00:11:54,940 --> 00:11:59,180
I can honestly say that it's one of the best purchases I've ever made and I've

175
00:11:59,180 --> 00:12:01,340
used Videoblocks since day one.

176
00:12:01,340 --> 00:12:06,860
You can try out Videoblocks exclusively for seven days with the link videoblocks.com slash

177
00:12:06,860 --> 00:12:07,860
future.

178
00:12:07,860 --> 00:12:11,660
That is not a publicly available trial so please go try them out.

179
00:12:11,660 --> 00:12:15,700
Not only is that a great way to help Wendover Productions make more videos, you'll also

180
00:12:15,700 --> 00:12:19,560
get a chance to use what is truly an amazing service.

181
00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:25,300
You can also support Wendover Productions on Patreon here, follow me on Twitter at WendoverPro,

182

185
00:12:37,140 --> 00:12:37,740
video.
