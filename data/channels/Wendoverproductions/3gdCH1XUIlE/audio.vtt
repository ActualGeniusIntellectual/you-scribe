00:11.600 --> 00:20.080
upcoming Wendover original. Back during World War II, a young doctor named R. Adams Cowley

00:20.080 --> 00:24.640
spent his deployment on the battlefields of Europe, treating patients on the precipice

00:24.640 --> 00:30.400
between life and death. He observed, through this experience, that those suffering from the

00:30.400 --> 00:35.440
medical state of shock following a traumatic injury were placed on an often certain,

00:35.440 --> 00:42.480
but not immediate, path towards death. This exposure to those patients developed his life's

00:42.480 --> 00:49.200
goal—he sought to take those on the certain path towards death and nurse them back to life. He

00:49.200 --> 00:56.480
wanted to be able to treat then-untreatable major traumatic injuries. Some years later, in 1960,

00:56.480 --> 01:01.520
he neared closer to this goal by opening, in some corner of the sprawling University of Maryland

01:01.520 --> 01:08.080
Medical Center, a two-bed unit dedicated to treating major trauma patients—the first such

01:08.080 --> 01:14.160
department in the country. Cowley started with about a 40% survival rate, but as his experience

01:14.160 --> 01:20.720
accumulated, and his techniques refined, more and more patients survived. It turned out that

01:20.720 --> 01:27.600
the certain path towards death for major trauma patients was not so certain. However, he also

01:27.600 --> 01:32.880
observed that even his reliable techniques couldn't reverse the course of death if a patient

01:32.880 --> 01:38.560
took too long to get to him. He posited that once someone experienced major trauma, they had a

01:38.560 --> 01:45.840
roughly 60-minute window to reach him, or else it was too late. The problem was that, by the time

01:45.840 --> 01:51.920
other doctors transferred a patient to Cowley, that window had often passed. The system just

01:51.920 --> 01:59.120
wasn't suited for this sort of speed. Therefore, he reinvented the system. First, he lobbied for

01:59.120 --> 02:04.640
ambulances to bring trauma patients directly to him, or eventually other trauma units, rather

02:04.640 --> 02:09.920
than just to the nearest, potentially unequipped hospital, as was standard protocol at the time.

02:09.920 --> 02:15.360
Second, he convinced the Maryland State Police to use their helicopters to bring trauma patients

02:15.360 --> 02:22.080
to his unit—dramatically reducing the average time to care. Cowley dubbed this 60-minute window

02:22.080 --> 02:27.920
the Golden Hour, and the principles behind it are now the central, guiding light of the emergency

02:28.000 --> 02:34.400
medical service system. Its purpose is to stabilize, triage, and transport as fast as

02:34.400 --> 02:40.400
possible because, according to this Golden Hour principle, faster is always better in trauma

02:40.400 --> 02:46.160
medicine. The vast majority of the American population can reach their nearest hospital

02:46.160 --> 02:51.680
within the Golden Hour with a traditional ground-based ambulance system—but not all.

02:52.480 --> 02:57.600
This is a map of the US, and these are the areas more than a 60-minute round-trip drive

02:57.600 --> 03:03.920
to the nearest hospital. There are vast swaths of the sparsely populated American West where ground

03:03.920 --> 03:09.040
ambulances cannot fulfill the Golden Hour principle, especially given the recent spate

03:09.040 --> 03:15.200
of closures of unprofitable rural hospitals. In fact, it's not even very difficult to run into

03:15.200 --> 03:21.280
this problem. If you were to drive from Denver to Las Vegas, two major American cities, most of your

03:21.280 --> 03:26.640
trip would take place on Interstate 70, which would lead you through the desolate area of the

03:26.640 --> 03:32.720
San Rafael Swell. If your car were to crash here, your nearest hospital would be over 90 minutes

03:32.720 --> 03:39.520
away in Moab, and this is just on the interstate—the central circulatory system of the US.

03:40.080 --> 03:46.720
It's plenty possible to get much, much further from medical care, and so, to plug these gaps,

03:46.720 --> 03:52.400
to get patients in the most rural areas and dire circumstances to care as fast as possible,

03:52.960 --> 03:57.280
that's where the country's air ambulance system steps in.

03:58.160 --> 04:04.400
Across the nation, there are some 900 air ambulances stationed at hundreds of bases,

04:04.400 --> 04:09.680
each of which expands the number of people able to reach hospital within an hour. Each of these

04:09.680 --> 04:16.000
aircraft have the potential to change lives each and every day, and play a part in many people's

04:16.000 --> 04:20.800
worst days. When your life is on the line, every minute counts,

04:20.800 --> 04:26.640
so these aircraft save life and limb with every flight. Right?

04:27.760 --> 04:33.920
Well, to a certain person—maybe an executive at an air ambulance company, for example—these

04:33.920 --> 04:42.000
702 words up until now probably all sound correct. But are they really? Everything up until now

04:42.000 --> 04:46.720
covered one simple principle—more trauma patients brought to the hospital within 60

04:46.720 --> 04:54.160
minutes equals more lives saved. It can't possibly be that the central tenet of emergency medicine,

04:54.160 --> 05:02.960
the golden hour principle, is just wrong, right? Well, in 2001, an academic review posed that

05:02.960 --> 05:09.120
exact question and found, quote, "...no large, well-controlled studies in the civilian population

05:09.120 --> 05:16.160
that either strongly support or refute the idea that faster is universally better in trauma care."

05:16.160 --> 05:21.360
Essentially, it's said that the golden hour principle could be true, but despite the fact

05:21.360 --> 05:26.720
that the entire EMS system operates on the collective assumption that it is true,

05:26.720 --> 05:33.520
we just don't know for sure. So, in response, researchers sought an answer.

05:33.520 --> 05:38.800
Plenty found that the answer was yes—as one would expect, faster transport to the hospital

05:39.120 --> 05:45.520
does improve survival outcomes—but plenty others didn't. This one found that, quote,

05:45.520 --> 05:50.000
"...the time factor involved in managing and transporting hypotensive penetrating injury

05:50.000 --> 05:55.440
victims directly to a regional trauma center does not appear to be related to an adverse outcome."

05:55.440 --> 06:01.120
This one concluded with, quote, "...no prehospital time less than 90 minutes exerted a significant

06:01.120 --> 06:06.080
adverse effect upon survival," while this one found, quote, "...no significant difference

06:06.080 --> 06:10.800
in survival after traumatic injury when the 8-minute ambulance response time criteria was

06:10.800 --> 06:16.240
exceeded." Similar results—failing to find a statistically significant link between total

06:16.240 --> 06:23.200
prehospital time and survival outcomes—were found in this study, and this one, and this one,

06:23.760 --> 06:30.160
and this one, and countless more. Twenty years onwards, from that academic review,

06:30.160 --> 06:35.920
the only certainty here is uncertainty. There is no scientific consensus on whether the golden

06:36.480 --> 06:43.360
hour is truly relevant today. Uncertainty is fine—it's part of the scientific process—but

06:43.360 --> 06:49.760
the entire American air ambulance industry is built on a collective, unverified assumption

06:49.760 --> 06:57.120
that the golden hour principle is indeed true. However, since we're dealing with assumptions,

06:57.120 --> 07:03.040
let's tackle another one. When you think of air ambulances, you probably imagine a flight from

07:03.040 --> 07:09.200
here to here—scene to hospital. Of course, that's what you see in the movies, but these sorts of

07:09.200 --> 07:15.760
flights only account for about a third of air ambulance trips. The vast majority of their

07:15.760 --> 07:22.720
business involves hospital to hospital transfers. You see, the trauma care system that Dr. Cowley

07:22.720 --> 07:28.800
innovated evolved into a nationwide, hierarchical network. Essentially, there are five levels of

07:28.800 --> 07:33.200
trauma centers—hospital certified to treat patients with major traumatic injuries—and

07:33.200 --> 07:37.440
as you go up in the levels, the centers become more advanced and less widespread.

07:38.000 --> 07:42.960
Levels five and four mainly deal with stabilization and initial evaluation

07:42.960 --> 07:48.560
prior to transport to a higher-level center, while level three centers will have on-call surgeons who

07:48.560 --> 07:54.560
could start to resolve simpler trauma cases. Level two centers have surgeons with 24-hour

07:54.560 --> 07:59.680
immediate availability, rather than just on-call, in addition to certain specialists.

07:59.680 --> 08:06.240
Then, those most advanced, level one centers have everything conceivably necessary for any trauma

08:06.240 --> 08:11.520
case, including specialists across all fields, and the ability to treat a case all the way from

08:11.520 --> 08:18.240
initial presentation through rehabilitation—which can be a multi-year process. Level one trauma

08:18.240 --> 08:23.440
centers are incredibly expensive to run, and therefore need a critical mass of patients to

08:23.440 --> 08:30.560
cover costs. Consequently, it's very possible to be more than 600 miles or 950 kilometers from one

08:30.560 --> 08:37.680
while in the lower 48, or 2,000 miles or 3,200 kilometers from one while in Alaska. Due to this

08:37.680 --> 08:44.000
potential distance, a major trauma case outside a major city would typically go first to a level

08:44.000 --> 08:49.600
three, four, or five trauma center, which are far more commonplace, where they'd be stabilized and

08:49.600 --> 08:54.320
evaluated to determine whether they need to be transferred to a more advanced facility.

08:54.320 --> 09:01.200
So, someone in a vehicle crash in the San Rafael Swell on I-70 in Utah would likely first go to

09:01.200 --> 09:06.240
the Moab Regional Hospital, which is a level four center. If the doctors and nurses there

09:06.240 --> 09:10.720
determined the patient needed a higher level of care, they would be transferred—in this case,

09:10.720 --> 09:15.920
to St. Mary's Hospital in Grand Junction, Colorado, which is a level two center. Then,

09:15.920 --> 09:21.120
if that hospital determined the patient had such complex and specialized injuries

09:21.120 --> 09:25.760
that even they couldn't handle it, the patient would likely be transferred to Denver Health's

09:25.760 --> 09:31.040
level one trauma center. Since each of these transfers would take hours by ground,

09:31.040 --> 09:36.640
the decision would almost certainly be made for major trauma cases to use an air ambulance.

09:37.280 --> 09:44.080
This is the bread and butter of the air ambulance business, and surely this saves lives, right?

09:45.040 --> 09:51.840
Well, yes and no. In one study of major trauma patients suffering from certain high mortality

09:51.840 --> 09:58.640
injuries, patients admitted to level two centers had a 29.7% mortality rate, while those admitted

09:58.640 --> 10:06.480
to a level one center only die 25.4% of the time. More advanced trauma centers do save more lives,

10:06.480 --> 10:11.600
and therefore conventional wisdom would assume that transfers to higher level centers save lives,

10:11.600 --> 10:15.760
but conventional wisdom almost always misses the nuance of a situation.

10:16.480 --> 10:22.160
According to another study, some quarter of adults and half of children transferred to level

10:22.160 --> 10:26.800
one trauma centers are brought there unnecessarily—in other words, they've been

10:26.800 --> 10:32.960
subject to secondary overtriage, where the more advanced center ends up discharging them after

10:32.960 --> 10:37.040
completing treatment that a less advanced center would have been plenty capable of.

10:37.840 --> 10:44.240
Now, a certain level of secondary overtriage is to be expected and even encouraged—after all,

10:44.240 --> 10:50.880
it's better to be safe than sorry—but again, we need that nuance. For an overtriaged patient,

10:50.880 --> 10:55.760
they would have survived if they had stayed in a level three center, for example, and they did

10:55.760 --> 11:01.520
survive when they ended up in a level one center, so the health outcome was the same, but for those

11:01.520 --> 11:09.280
patients transferred by an air ambulance, they received something else—an absolutely massive

11:09.920 --> 11:16.720
bill. A conservative estimate puts the average price of an air ambulance flight in the US

11:16.720 --> 11:24.080
at $27,900. Others put that figure even higher, well into the $30,000 or $40,000,

11:24.080 --> 11:28.960
meaning it's very possible, and even common, for someone to be charged more for a quick

11:28.960 --> 11:35.680
hospital ride to or from the hospital than they make in a year. Another counterargument, though—a

11:35.680 --> 11:42.000
human life, to the holder of that life, is essentially invaluable—any cost to save it

11:42.000 --> 11:50.080
is worth it. But the problem is not the cost—it's the price. The cost for air ambulance companies to

11:50.080 --> 11:56.160
operate a given flight, according to the companies themselves, is somewhere between $6,000 and $13,000.

11:57.120 --> 12:05.440
That shouldn't be possible—as in, quite literally, the rules of economics say that that gap between

12:05.440 --> 12:11.520
cost and price shouldn't be possible, because in a normal free market, for normal products,

12:11.520 --> 12:17.920
competition would drive down prices far closer to costs since lower prices increase demand,

12:17.920 --> 12:23.520
and companies can increase profits with greater market share, but the American air ambulance market

12:23.520 --> 12:30.080
is very far from normal. Every product in the world can be mapped onto a graph that looks like

12:30.080 --> 12:37.680
this—price on the y-axis, quantity purchased on the x. This is what a normal product looks like—as

12:37.680 --> 12:44.640
price goes down, quantity purchased goes up. There are some exceptions to this—for example, certain

12:44.640 --> 12:49.360
luxury goods plot like this on the graph, where higher prices actually stimulate higher demand,

12:49.440 --> 12:56.480
to an extent—although almost no product will look like this. This, however, is the relationship

12:56.480 --> 13:03.840
between price and demand for air ambulances—as price increases, it has zero impact on demand.

13:03.840 --> 13:08.720
It's easy to understand why—the people purchasing and paying for air ambulance flights

13:08.720 --> 13:15.040
have no agency over whether or not to do so. The decision to use an air ambulance is made by

13:15.040 --> 13:21.360
first responders or doctors, not the often unconscious patient, so there is a complete

13:21.360 --> 13:28.480
lack of market forces working to lower the price. When a free market isn't working to regulate the

13:28.480 --> 13:34.000
allocation of goods and services into the most societally advantageous configuration—which

13:34.000 --> 13:38.400
in this case would be the greatest possible availability of air ambulances at the lowest

13:38.400 --> 13:45.280
possible prices—economists would describe that as a market failure. In cases of market failure,

13:45.280 --> 13:50.800
even the most staunchly libertarian economist would tend to agree that the only solution,

13:50.800 --> 13:56.560
at that point, would be external intervention—typically by the government—and so this

13:56.560 --> 14:03.600
massive, critical industry charging vulnerable people massive, crippling prices can't possibly

14:03.600 --> 14:10.800
be completely unregulated. Right? Wrong. In fact, not only is the air ambulance

14:10.800 --> 14:18.160
industry not regulated, but it seemingly can't be. You see, back in 1978, Congress passed the

14:18.160 --> 14:24.080
Airline Deregulation Act, ending the government's ability to regulate the fares of airlines.

14:24.080 --> 14:29.360
This led to a dramatic decrease in air fares and a dramatic increase in flights—essentially,

14:29.360 --> 14:32.560
it paved the way for the US to become the world's largest aviation market—but

14:33.360 --> 14:40.240
when it sought to deregulate airlines, that truly meant all airlines. Through the years,

14:40.240 --> 14:45.280
as various states have attempted to fix the market failure of the air ambulance industry,

14:45.280 --> 14:51.200
providers have successfully argued in court time and time again that because they are technically

14:51.200 --> 14:56.320
airlines, and because the Airline Deregulation Act prevents states from regulating air fares,

14:56.880 --> 15:04.720
states cannot regulate the prices air ambulances charge. There is truly no limit to what they can

15:04.720 --> 15:11.600
charge. But wait, there is another, unique market force in the American healthcare industry that

15:11.600 --> 15:19.440
could solve this problem—that of insurance. Right? You see, most insurers in the US have

15:19.440 --> 15:25.360
a network of providers that they cover, and if a patient uses an out-of-network provider,

15:25.360 --> 15:30.080
they are charged a far higher rate, or are subject to an annual spending cap.

15:30.080 --> 15:35.040
In non-emergency circumstances, it's often possible to find an in-network provider,

15:35.040 --> 15:39.440
and many states, and recently the federal government too, have passed legislation

15:39.440 --> 15:45.280
limiting out-of-network bills for emergencies, but of course, thanks to the Airline Deregulation Act,

15:45.280 --> 15:53.760
those don't apply to air ambulances. In the US, some 77% of air ambulance flights are billed

15:53.760 --> 15:58.960
out-of-network, meaning patients are on the hook for all, or at least the vast majority,

15:58.960 --> 16:07.360
of those $30,000 or $40,000 or $50,000 air ambulance bills. This is, once again,

16:07.360 --> 16:13.840
a symptom of market failure. For most medical services, insured patients have the ability to

16:13.840 --> 16:18.960
choose which provider they go to, they have the ability to choose to go to an in-network provider,

16:18.960 --> 16:24.240
which is a market force that pushes providers to accept as many types of insurance as possible—if

16:24.240 --> 16:30.480
they didn't, they would lose business—and those insurers have the scale to negotiate prices down.

16:30.480 --> 16:36.000
With air ambulances, though, since patients have zero ability to choose which provider they use,

16:36.000 --> 16:41.440
or even whether they use one at all, there are no market forces pushing providers to bring more

16:41.440 --> 16:47.520
insurers in-network. In fact, they often get paid more from out-of-network patients,

16:47.520 --> 16:53.200
meaning they not only lack incentive to bring insurers in-network, but market forces are pushing

16:53.200 --> 16:59.680
them to minimize the number of carriers in their network. Air ambulance providers, and more

16:59.680 --> 17:05.440
specifically, the private equity firms that now own the majority of them, have figured out just

17:05.440 --> 17:12.800
how exploitable this market failure is. Since 2000, the number of air ambulances in the US

17:12.800 --> 17:18.400
has more than doubled to nearly 900, and the average annual flight hours per helicopter

17:18.400 --> 17:25.840
have dropped from a high of 600 in 2003 to almost 450, as these companies further saturate the

17:25.840 --> 17:33.360
market. In the same time period, average prices have more than tripled. It's tough to get a good

17:33.360 --> 17:38.000
gauge of just how much these companies are profiting on the plight of Americans in the most

17:38.000 --> 17:43.280
vulnerable moment of their lives, largely because almost all the major players in the industry

17:43.280 --> 17:47.920
are now owned by private equity firms and therefore don't report their financial results.

17:48.480 --> 17:55.440
What's clear, though, is this—in 2017, according to one study, air ambulances owned by private

17:55.440 --> 18:02.080
equity firms charged about double what those owned by hospitals or non-profits did. The cost

18:02.080 --> 18:07.600
to operate non-profit and for-profit air ambulances are not dramatically different,

18:07.600 --> 18:14.240
so the only reasonable conclusion is that these private, for-profit air ambulances are pocketing

18:14.240 --> 18:21.040
thousands upon thousands of dollars in profit per patient. There is nothing stopping this

18:21.040 --> 18:26.480
industry from charging higher and higher rates—not market forces, not regulation,

18:27.040 --> 18:31.440
nothing—and so these private equity companies, having realized this,

18:31.440 --> 18:37.200
will keep jacking up prices and turning highway accidents and heart attacks into higher returns

18:37.200 --> 18:43.040
for their investors. Right now, this is an industry that can't be stopped.

18:43.760 --> 18:49.760
There is, however, potentially momentum for reform with the recently passed No Surprises Act,

18:49.760 --> 18:55.840
which caps out-of-network charges and emergencies, but it's unclear exactly how this can and will

18:55.840 --> 19:01.600
impact the air ambulance industry when it takes effect in 2022, given the protections of the

19:01.600 --> 19:10.080
Airline Deregulation Act. Any doctor knows the words, primum non nocere, a Latin phrase that

19:10.080 --> 19:18.000
translates to, first, do no harm. It's a maxim that guides every med school bioethics course,

19:18.000 --> 19:24.640
and it essentially recognizes that in medicine, it is possible to do more harm than good.

19:24.640 --> 19:31.280
It's why, when someone reaches the final days or hours of their life, and the outcome is certain,

19:31.280 --> 19:37.280
the decision is typically made to withhold treatment—because it can only harm. Treatments

19:37.280 --> 19:43.040
come with physical, emotional, and financial burdens, so they're simply not worth it when

19:43.040 --> 19:50.000
the path towards death is irreversible. When air ambulances are used, the goal is to reverse that

19:50.000 --> 19:57.760
path, and in many cases, they do. However, the best research into the matter estimates that for

19:57.760 --> 20:06.800
every 100 air ambulance flights, four lives are saved. That means that in 96 cases out of 100,

20:06.800 --> 20:14.080
the patient or their next of kin walks out of the hospital having lost a year of income. They walk

20:14.080 --> 20:18.960
out having pushed back retirement by a year, having lost the ability to send their kids to

20:18.960 --> 20:27.040
college, or by a house, or gone on vacation. They've lost a non-trivial quantity of quality

20:27.040 --> 20:35.280
of life. In 96 cases out of 100, doctors using private air ambulance providers are forced to

20:35.280 --> 20:42.080
violate their Hippocratic Oath—they are forced to make a split-second decision that does harm,

20:42.080 --> 20:48.880
and changes lives for the worse, all because, at the end of the line, there's some wealthy investor

20:48.960 --> 20:55.440
in some private equity firm who prefers a 10.5% return on investment over 10.4%,

20:56.560 --> 21:04.560
and nobody's doing anything to stop them. Any long-time Wendover viewer will have heard

21:04.560 --> 21:09.360
of the CuriosityStream-Nebula bundle deal. You sign up for any CuriosityStream subscription at

21:09.360 --> 21:15.360
this link, and you get a free Nebula account too, but for those of you who have not yet signed up,

21:15.360 --> 21:21.120
now's a really good time. That's because I just released a three-part trivia show featuring Brian

21:21.120 --> 21:25.760
from Real Engineering, Jordan Harrod, and Dave from City Beautiful, plus I'm releasing a brand

21:25.760 --> 21:31.520
new Wendover original that was shot a while ago on location next month. Of course, the only place

21:31.520 --> 21:36.080
to watch this is on Nebula, as their business model makes bigger projects like this financially

21:36.080 --> 21:40.800
possible, and there's quite literally never been a better time to sign up. That's because our

21:40.800 --> 21:46.800
sponsor, CuriosityStream, is having its biggest ever sale—41% off, meaning it works out to less

21:46.800 --> 21:52.800
than $1 a month, and by signing up at CuriosityStream.com-slash-Wendover, any subscription

21:52.800 --> 21:58.560
is bundled with a Nebula subscription for the exact same price. Plus, CuriosityStream has

21:58.560 --> 22:04.560
tons of great new stuff too, like Dream Routes—a three-part film that focuses in on three of Asia's

22:04.560 --> 22:09.760
most storied and historic roads, which really helps scratch any travel itch you might have

22:09.760 --> 22:15.360
right now. So, if you want to watch all Wendover and HAI videos early and ad-free,

22:15.360 --> 22:20.160
plus all our exclusive originals, plus all of CuriosityStream's great non-fiction shows and

22:20.160 --> 22:24.800
films, make sure to head over to CuriosityStream.com-slash-Wendover, and you'll be

22:24.800 --> 22:30.320
helping to support this and tons of other independent educational creators while you're at it.
