3
00:00:11,600 --> 00:00:20,080
upcoming Wendover original. Back during World War II, a young doctor named R. Adams Cowley

4
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:24,640
spent his deployment on the battlefields of Europe, treating patients on the precipice

5
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:30,400
between life and death. He observed, through this experience, that those suffering from the

6
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:35,440
medical state of shock following a traumatic injury were placed on an often certain,

7
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:42,480
but not immediate, path towards death. This exposure to those patients developed his life's

8
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:49,200
goal—he sought to take those on the certain path towards death and nurse them back to life. He

9
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:56,480
wanted to be able to treat then-untreatable major traumatic injuries. Some years later, in 1960,

10
00:00:56,480 --> 00:01:01,520
he neared closer to this goal by opening, in some corner of the sprawling University of Maryland

11
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:08,080
Medical Center, a two-bed unit dedicated to treating major trauma patients—the first such

12
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:14,160
department in the country. Cowley started with about a 40% survival rate, but as his experience

13
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:20,720
accumulated, and his techniques refined, more and more patients survived. It turned out that

14
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:27,600
the certain path towards death for major trauma patients was not so certain. However, he also

15
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:32,880
observed that even his reliable techniques couldn't reverse the course of death if a patient

16
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:38,560
took too long to get to him. He posited that once someone experienced major trauma, they had a

17
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:45,840
roughly 60-minute window to reach him, or else it was too late. The problem was that, by the time

18
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:51,920
other doctors transferred a patient to Cowley, that window had often passed. The system just

19
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:59,120
wasn't suited for this sort of speed. Therefore, he reinvented the system. First, he lobbied for

20
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:04,640
ambulances to bring trauma patients directly to him, or eventually other trauma units, rather

21
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:09,920
than just to the nearest, potentially unequipped hospital, as was standard protocol at the time.

22
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:15,360
Second, he convinced the Maryland State Police to use their helicopters to bring trauma patients

23
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:22,080
to his unit—dramatically reducing the average time to care. Cowley dubbed this 60-minute window

24
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:27,920
the Golden Hour, and the principles behind it are now the central, guiding light of the emergency

25
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:34,400
medical service system. Its purpose is to stabilize, triage, and transport as fast as

26
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:40,400
possible because, according to this Golden Hour principle, faster is always better in trauma

27
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:46,160
medicine. The vast majority of the American population can reach their nearest hospital

28
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:51,680
within the Golden Hour with a traditional ground-based ambulance system—but not all.

29
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:57,600
This is a map of the US, and these are the areas more than a 60-minute round-trip drive

30
00:02:57,600 --> 00:03:03,920
to the nearest hospital. There are vast swaths of the sparsely populated American West where ground

31
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:09,040
ambulances cannot fulfill the Golden Hour principle, especially given the recent spate

32
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:15,200
of closures of unprofitable rural hospitals. In fact, it's not even very difficult to run into

33
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:21,280
this problem. If you were to drive from Denver to Las Vegas, two major American cities, most of your

34
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:26,640
trip would take place on Interstate 70, which would lead you through the desolate area of the

35
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:32,720
San Rafael Swell. If your car were to crash here, your nearest hospital would be over 90 minutes

36
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:39,520
away in Moab, and this is just on the interstate—the central circulatory system of the US.

37
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:46,720
It's plenty possible to get much, much further from medical care, and so, to plug these gaps,

38
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:52,400
to get patients in the most rural areas and dire circumstances to care as fast as possible,

39
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:57,280
that's where the country's air ambulance system steps in.

40
00:03:58,160 --> 00:04:04,400
Across the nation, there are some 900 air ambulances stationed at hundreds of bases,

41
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:09,680
each of which expands the number of people able to reach hospital within an hour. Each of these

42
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:16,000
aircraft have the potential to change lives each and every day, and play a part in many people's

43
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:20,800
worst days. When your life is on the line, every minute counts,

44
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:26,640
so these aircraft save life and limb with every flight. Right?

45
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:33,920
Well, to a certain person—maybe an executive at an air ambulance company, for example—these

46
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:42,000
702 words up until now probably all sound correct. But are they really? Everything up until now

47
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:46,720
covered one simple principle—more trauma patients brought to the hospital within 60

48
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:54,160
minutes equals more lives saved. It can't possibly be that the central tenet of emergency medicine,

49
00:04:54,160 --> 00:05:02,960
the golden hour principle, is just wrong, right? Well, in 2001, an academic review posed that

50
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:09,120
exact question and found, quote, "...no large, well-controlled studies in the civilian population

51
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:16,160
that either strongly support or refute the idea that faster is universally better in trauma care."

52
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:21,360
Essentially, it's said that the golden hour principle could be true, but despite the fact

53
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:26,720
that the entire EMS system operates on the collective assumption that it is true,

54
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:33,520
we just don't know for sure. So, in response, researchers sought an answer.

55
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:38,800
Plenty found that the answer was yes—as one would expect, faster transport to the hospital

56
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:45,520
does improve survival outcomes—but plenty others didn't. This one found that, quote,

57
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:50,000
"...the time factor involved in managing and transporting hypotensive penetrating injury

58
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:55,440
victims directly to a regional trauma center does not appear to be related to an adverse outcome."

59
00:05:55,440 --> 00:06:01,120
This one concluded with, quote, "...no prehospital time less than 90 minutes exerted a significant

60
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:06,080
adverse effect upon survival," while this one found, quote, "...no significant difference

61
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:10,800
in survival after traumatic injury when the 8-minute ambulance response time criteria was

62
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:16,240
exceeded." Similar results—failing to find a statistically significant link between total

63
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:23,200
prehospital time and survival outcomes—were found in this study, and this one, and this one,

64
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:30,160
and this one, and countless more. Twenty years onwards, from that academic review,

65
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:35,920
the only certainty here is uncertainty. There is no scientific consensus on whether the golden

66
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:43,360
hour is truly relevant today. Uncertainty is fine—it's part of the scientific process—but

67
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:49,760
the entire American air ambulance industry is built on a collective, unverified assumption

68
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:57,120
that the golden hour principle is indeed true. However, since we're dealing with assumptions,

69
00:06:57,120 --> 00:07:03,040
let's tackle another one. When you think of air ambulances, you probably imagine a flight from

70
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:09,200
here to here—scene to hospital. Of course, that's what you see in the movies, but these sorts of

71
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:15,760
flights only account for about a third of air ambulance trips. The vast majority of their

72
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:22,720
business involves hospital to hospital transfers. You see, the trauma care system that Dr. Cowley

73
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:28,800
innovated evolved into a nationwide, hierarchical network. Essentially, there are five levels of

74
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:33,200
trauma centers—hospital certified to treat patients with major traumatic injuries—and

75
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:37,440
as you go up in the levels, the centers become more advanced and less widespread.

76
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:42,960
Levels five and four mainly deal with stabilization and initial evaluation

77
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:48,560
prior to transport to a higher-level center, while level three centers will have on-call surgeons who

78
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:54,560
could start to resolve simpler trauma cases. Level two centers have surgeons with 24-hour

79
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:59,680
immediate availability, rather than just on-call, in addition to certain specialists.

80
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:06,240
Then, those most advanced, level one centers have everything conceivably necessary for any trauma

81
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:11,520
case, including specialists across all fields, and the ability to treat a case all the way from

82
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:18,240
initial presentation through rehabilitation—which can be a multi-year process. Level one trauma

83
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:23,440
centers are incredibly expensive to run, and therefore need a critical mass of patients to

84
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:30,560
cover costs. Consequently, it's very possible to be more than 600 miles or 950 kilometers from one

85
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:37,680
while in the lower 48, or 2,000 miles or 3,200 kilometers from one while in Alaska. Due to this

86
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:44,000
potential distance, a major trauma case outside a major city would typically go first to a level

87
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:49,600
three, four, or five trauma center, which are far more commonplace, where they'd be stabilized and

88
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:54,320
evaluated to determine whether they need to be transferred to a more advanced facility.

89
00:08:54,320 --> 00:09:01,200
So, someone in a vehicle crash in the San Rafael Swell on I-70 in Utah would likely first go to

90
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:06,240
the Moab Regional Hospital, which is a level four center. If the doctors and nurses there

91
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:10,720
determined the patient needed a higher level of care, they would be transferred—in this case,

92
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:15,920
to St. Mary's Hospital in Grand Junction, Colorado, which is a level two center. Then,

93
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:21,120
if that hospital determined the patient had such complex and specialized injuries

94
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:25,760
that even they couldn't handle it, the patient would likely be transferred to Denver Health's

95
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:31,040
level one trauma center. Since each of these transfers would take hours by ground,

96
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:36,640
the decision would almost certainly be made for major trauma cases to use an air ambulance.

97
00:09:37,280 --> 00:09:44,080
This is the bread and butter of the air ambulance business, and surely this saves lives, right?

98
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:51,840
Well, yes and no. In one study of major trauma patients suffering from certain high mortality

99
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:58,640
injuries, patients admitted to level two centers had a 29.7% mortality rate, while those admitted

100
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:06,480
to a level one center only die 25.4% of the time. More advanced trauma centers do save more lives,

101
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:11,600
and therefore conventional wisdom would assume that transfers to higher level centers save lives,

102
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:15,760
but conventional wisdom almost always misses the nuance of a situation.

103
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:22,160
According to another study, some quarter of adults and half of children transferred to level

104
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:26,800
one trauma centers are brought there unnecessarily—in other words, they've been

105
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:32,960
subject to secondary overtriage, where the more advanced center ends up discharging them after

106
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:37,040
completing treatment that a less advanced center would have been plenty capable of.

107
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:44,240
Now, a certain level of secondary overtriage is to be expected and even encouraged—after all,

108
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:50,880
it's better to be safe than sorry—but again, we need that nuance. For an overtriaged patient,

109
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:55,760
they would have survived if they had stayed in a level three center, for example, and they did

110
00:10:55,760 --> 00:11:01,520
survive when they ended up in a level one center, so the health outcome was the same, but for those

111
00:11:01,520 --> 00:11:09,280
patients transferred by an air ambulance, they received something else—an absolutely massive

112
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:16,720
bill. A conservative estimate puts the average price of an air ambulance flight in the US

113
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:24,080
at $27,900. Others put that figure even higher, well into the $30,000 or $40,000,

114
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:28,960
meaning it's very possible, and even common, for someone to be charged more for a quick

115
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:35,680
hospital ride to or from the hospital than they make in a year. Another counterargument, though—a

116
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:42,000
human life, to the holder of that life, is essentially invaluable—any cost to save it

117
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:50,080
is worth it. But the problem is not the cost—it's the price. The cost for air ambulance companies to

118
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:56,160
operate a given flight, according to the companies themselves, is somewhere between $6,000 and $13,000.

119
00:11:57,120 --> 00:12:05,440
That shouldn't be possible—as in, quite literally, the rules of economics say that that gap between

120
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:11,520
cost and price shouldn't be possible, because in a normal free market, for normal products,

121
00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:17,920
competition would drive down prices far closer to costs since lower prices increase demand,

122
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:23,520
and companies can increase profits with greater market share, but the American air ambulance market

123
00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:30,080
is very far from normal. Every product in the world can be mapped onto a graph that looks like

124
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:37,680
this—price on the y-axis, quantity purchased on the x. This is what a normal product looks like—as

125
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:44,640
price goes down, quantity purchased goes up. There are some exceptions to this—for example, certain

126
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:49,360
luxury goods plot like this on the graph, where higher prices actually stimulate higher demand,

127
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:56,480
to an extent—although almost no product will look like this. This, however, is the relationship

128
00:12:56,480 --> 00:13:03,840
between price and demand for air ambulances—as price increases, it has zero impact on demand.

129
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:08,720
It's easy to understand why—the people purchasing and paying for air ambulance flights

130
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:15,040
have no agency over whether or not to do so. The decision to use an air ambulance is made by

131
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:21,360
first responders or doctors, not the often unconscious patient, so there is a complete

132
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:28,480
lack of market forces working to lower the price. When a free market isn't working to regulate the

133
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:34,000
allocation of goods and services into the most societally advantageous configuration—which

134
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:38,400
in this case would be the greatest possible availability of air ambulances at the lowest

135
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:45,280
possible prices—economists would describe that as a market failure. In cases of market failure,

136
00:13:45,280 --> 00:13:50,800
even the most staunchly libertarian economist would tend to agree that the only solution,

137
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:56,560
at that point, would be external intervention—typically by the government—and so this

138
00:13:56,560 --> 00:14:03,600
massive, critical industry charging vulnerable people massive, crippling prices can't possibly

139
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:10,800
be completely unregulated. Right? Wrong. In fact, not only is the air ambulance

140
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:18,160
industry not regulated, but it seemingly can't be. You see, back in 1978, Congress passed the

141
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:24,080
Airline Deregulation Act, ending the government's ability to regulate the fares of airlines.

142
00:14:24,080 --> 00:14:29,360
This led to a dramatic decrease in air fares and a dramatic increase in flights—essentially,

143
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:32,560
it paved the way for the US to become the world's largest aviation market—but

144
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:40,240
when it sought to deregulate airlines, that truly meant all airlines. Through the years,

145
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:45,280
as various states have attempted to fix the market failure of the air ambulance industry,

146
00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:51,200
providers have successfully argued in court time and time again that because they are technically

147
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:56,320
airlines, and because the Airline Deregulation Act prevents states from regulating air fares,

148
00:14:56,880 --> 00:15:04,720
states cannot regulate the prices air ambulances charge. There is truly no limit to what they can

149
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:11,600
charge. But wait, there is another, unique market force in the American healthcare industry that

150
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:19,440
could solve this problem—that of insurance. Right? You see, most insurers in the US have

151
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:25,360
a network of providers that they cover, and if a patient uses an out-of-network provider,

152
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:30,080
they are charged a far higher rate, or are subject to an annual spending cap.

153
00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:35,040
In non-emergency circumstances, it's often possible to find an in-network provider,

154
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:39,440
and many states, and recently the federal government too, have passed legislation

155
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:45,280
limiting out-of-network bills for emergencies, but of course, thanks to the Airline Deregulation Act,

156
00:15:45,280 --> 00:15:53,760
those don't apply to air ambulances. In the US, some 77% of air ambulance flights are billed

157
00:15:53,760 --> 00:15:58,960
out-of-network, meaning patients are on the hook for all, or at least the vast majority,

158
00:15:58,960 --> 00:16:07,360
of those $30,000 or $40,000 or $50,000 air ambulance bills. This is, once again,

159
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:13,840
a symptom of market failure. For most medical services, insured patients have the ability to

160
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:18,960
choose which provider they go to, they have the ability to choose to go to an in-network provider,

161
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:24,240
which is a market force that pushes providers to accept as many types of insurance as possible—if

162
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:30,480
they didn't, they would lose business—and those insurers have the scale to negotiate prices down.

163
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:36,000
With air ambulances, though, since patients have zero ability to choose which provider they use,

164
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:41,440
or even whether they use one at all, there are no market forces pushing providers to bring more

165
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:47,520
insurers in-network. In fact, they often get paid more from out-of-network patients,

166
00:16:47,520 --> 00:16:53,200
meaning they not only lack incentive to bring insurers in-network, but market forces are pushing

167
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:59,680
them to minimize the number of carriers in their network. Air ambulance providers, and more

168
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:05,440
specifically, the private equity firms that now own the majority of them, have figured out just

169
00:17:05,440 --> 00:17:12,800
how exploitable this market failure is. Since 2000, the number of air ambulances in the US

170
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:18,400
has more than doubled to nearly 900, and the average annual flight hours per helicopter

171
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:25,840
have dropped from a high of 600 in 2003 to almost 450, as these companies further saturate the

172
00:17:25,840 --> 00:17:33,360
market. In the same time period, average prices have more than tripled. It's tough to get a good

173
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:38,000
gauge of just how much these companies are profiting on the plight of Americans in the most

174
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:43,280
vulnerable moment of their lives, largely because almost all the major players in the industry

175
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:47,920
are now owned by private equity firms and therefore don't report their financial results.

176
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:55,440
What's clear, though, is this—in 2017, according to one study, air ambulances owned by private

177
00:17:55,440 --> 00:18:02,080
equity firms charged about double what those owned by hospitals or non-profits did. The cost

178
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:07,600
to operate non-profit and for-profit air ambulances are not dramatically different,

179
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:14,240
so the only reasonable conclusion is that these private, for-profit air ambulances are pocketing

180
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:21,040
thousands upon thousands of dollars in profit per patient. There is nothing stopping this

181
00:18:21,040 --> 00:18:26,480
industry from charging higher and higher rates—not market forces, not regulation,

182
00:18:27,040 --> 00:18:31,440
nothing—and so these private equity companies, having realized this,

183
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:37,200
will keep jacking up prices and turning highway accidents and heart attacks into higher returns

184
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:43,040
for their investors. Right now, this is an industry that can't be stopped.

185
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:49,760
There is, however, potentially momentum for reform with the recently passed No Surprises Act,

186
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:55,840
which caps out-of-network charges and emergencies, but it's unclear exactly how this can and will

187
00:18:55,840 --> 00:19:01,600
impact the air ambulance industry when it takes effect in 2022, given the protections of the

188
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:10,080
Airline Deregulation Act. Any doctor knows the words, primum non nocere, a Latin phrase that

189
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:18,000
translates to, first, do no harm. It's a maxim that guides every med school bioethics course,

190
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:24,640
and it essentially recognizes that in medicine, it is possible to do more harm than good.

191
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:31,280
It's why, when someone reaches the final days or hours of their life, and the outcome is certain,

192
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:37,280
the decision is typically made to withhold treatment—because it can only harm. Treatments

193
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:43,040
come with physical, emotional, and financial burdens, so they're simply not worth it when

194
00:19:43,040 --> 00:19:50,000
the path towards death is irreversible. When air ambulances are used, the goal is to reverse that

195
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:57,760
path, and in many cases, they do. However, the best research into the matter estimates that for

196
00:19:57,760 --> 00:20:06,800
every 100 air ambulance flights, four lives are saved. That means that in 96 cases out of 100,

197
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:14,080
the patient or their next of kin walks out of the hospital having lost a year of income. They walk

198
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:18,960
out having pushed back retirement by a year, having lost the ability to send their kids to

199
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:27,040
college, or by a house, or gone on vacation. They've lost a non-trivial quantity of quality

200
00:20:27,040 --> 00:20:35,280
of life. In 96 cases out of 100, doctors using private air ambulance providers are forced to

201
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:42,080
violate their Hippocratic Oath—they are forced to make a split-second decision that does harm,

202
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:48,880
and changes lives for the worse, all because, at the end of the line, there's some wealthy investor

203
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:55,440
in some private equity firm who prefers a 10.5% return on investment over 10.4%,

204
00:20:56,560 --> 00:21:04,560
and nobody's doing anything to stop them. Any long-time Wendover viewer will have heard

205
