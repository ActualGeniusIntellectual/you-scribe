11600	20080	upcoming Wendover original. Back during World War II, a young doctor named R. Adams Cowley
20080	24640	spent his deployment on the battlefields of Europe, treating patients on the precipice
24640	30400	between life and death. He observed, through this experience, that those suffering from the
30400	35440	medical state of shock following a traumatic injury were placed on an often certain,
35440	42480	but not immediate, path towards death. This exposure to those patients developed his life's
42480	49200	goal—he sought to take those on the certain path towards death and nurse them back to life. He
49200	56480	wanted to be able to treat then-untreatable major traumatic injuries. Some years later, in 1960,
56480	61520	he neared closer to this goal by opening, in some corner of the sprawling University of Maryland
61520	68080	Medical Center, a two-bed unit dedicated to treating major trauma patients—the first such
68080	74160	department in the country. Cowley started with about a 40% survival rate, but as his experience
74160	80720	accumulated, and his techniques refined, more and more patients survived. It turned out that
80720	87600	the certain path towards death for major trauma patients was not so certain. However, he also
87600	92880	observed that even his reliable techniques couldn't reverse the course of death if a patient
92880	98560	took too long to get to him. He posited that once someone experienced major trauma, they had a
98560	105840	roughly 60-minute window to reach him, or else it was too late. The problem was that, by the time
105840	111920	other doctors transferred a patient to Cowley, that window had often passed. The system just
111920	119120	wasn't suited for this sort of speed. Therefore, he reinvented the system. First, he lobbied for
119120	124640	ambulances to bring trauma patients directly to him, or eventually other trauma units, rather
124640	129920	than just to the nearest, potentially unequipped hospital, as was standard protocol at the time.
129920	135360	Second, he convinced the Maryland State Police to use their helicopters to bring trauma patients
135360	142080	to his unit—dramatically reducing the average time to care. Cowley dubbed this 60-minute window
142080	147920	the Golden Hour, and the principles behind it are now the central, guiding light of the emergency
148000	154400	medical service system. Its purpose is to stabilize, triage, and transport as fast as
154400	160400	possible because, according to this Golden Hour principle, faster is always better in trauma
160400	166160	medicine. The vast majority of the American population can reach their nearest hospital
166160	171680	within the Golden Hour with a traditional ground-based ambulance system—but not all.
172480	177600	This is a map of the US, and these are the areas more than a 60-minute round-trip drive
177600	183920	to the nearest hospital. There are vast swaths of the sparsely populated American West where ground
183920	189040	ambulances cannot fulfill the Golden Hour principle, especially given the recent spate
189040	195200	of closures of unprofitable rural hospitals. In fact, it's not even very difficult to run into
195200	201280	this problem. If you were to drive from Denver to Las Vegas, two major American cities, most of your
201280	206640	trip would take place on Interstate 70, which would lead you through the desolate area of the
206640	212720	San Rafael Swell. If your car were to crash here, your nearest hospital would be over 90 minutes
212720	219520	away in Moab, and this is just on the interstate—the central circulatory system of the US.
220080	226720	It's plenty possible to get much, much further from medical care, and so, to plug these gaps,
226720	232400	to get patients in the most rural areas and dire circumstances to care as fast as possible,
232960	237280	that's where the country's air ambulance system steps in.
238160	244400	Across the nation, there are some 900 air ambulances stationed at hundreds of bases,
244400	249680	each of which expands the number of people able to reach hospital within an hour. Each of these
249680	256000	aircraft have the potential to change lives each and every day, and play a part in many people's
256000	260800	worst days. When your life is on the line, every minute counts,
260800	266640	so these aircraft save life and limb with every flight. Right?
267760	273920	Well, to a certain person—maybe an executive at an air ambulance company, for example—these
273920	282000	702 words up until now probably all sound correct. But are they really? Everything up until now
282000	286720	covered one simple principle—more trauma patients brought to the hospital within 60
286720	294160	minutes equals more lives saved. It can't possibly be that the central tenet of emergency medicine,
294160	302960	the golden hour principle, is just wrong, right? Well, in 2001, an academic review posed that
302960	309120	exact question and found, quote, "...no large, well-controlled studies in the civilian population
309120	316160	that either strongly support or refute the idea that faster is universally better in trauma care."
316160	321360	Essentially, it's said that the golden hour principle could be true, but despite the fact
321360	326720	that the entire EMS system operates on the collective assumption that it is true,
326720	333520	we just don't know for sure. So, in response, researchers sought an answer.
333520	338800	Plenty found that the answer was yes—as one would expect, faster transport to the hospital
339120	345520	does improve survival outcomes—but plenty others didn't. This one found that, quote,
345520	350000	"...the time factor involved in managing and transporting hypotensive penetrating injury
350000	355440	victims directly to a regional trauma center does not appear to be related to an adverse outcome."
355440	361120	This one concluded with, quote, "...no prehospital time less than 90 minutes exerted a significant
361120	366080	adverse effect upon survival," while this one found, quote, "...no significant difference
366080	370800	in survival after traumatic injury when the 8-minute ambulance response time criteria was
370800	376240	exceeded." Similar results—failing to find a statistically significant link between total
376240	383200	prehospital time and survival outcomes—were found in this study, and this one, and this one,
383760	390160	and this one, and countless more. Twenty years onwards, from that academic review,
390160	395920	the only certainty here is uncertainty. There is no scientific consensus on whether the golden
396480	403360	hour is truly relevant today. Uncertainty is fine—it's part of the scientific process—but
403360	409760	the entire American air ambulance industry is built on a collective, unverified assumption
409760	417120	that the golden hour principle is indeed true. However, since we're dealing with assumptions,
417120	423040	let's tackle another one. When you think of air ambulances, you probably imagine a flight from
423040	429200	here to here—scene to hospital. Of course, that's what you see in the movies, but these sorts of
429200	435760	flights only account for about a third of air ambulance trips. The vast majority of their
435760	442720	business involves hospital to hospital transfers. You see, the trauma care system that Dr. Cowley
442720	448800	innovated evolved into a nationwide, hierarchical network. Essentially, there are five levels of
448800	453200	trauma centers—hospital certified to treat patients with major traumatic injuries—and
453200	457440	as you go up in the levels, the centers become more advanced and less widespread.
458000	462960	Levels five and four mainly deal with stabilization and initial evaluation
462960	468560	prior to transport to a higher-level center, while level three centers will have on-call surgeons who
468560	474560	could start to resolve simpler trauma cases. Level two centers have surgeons with 24-hour
474560	479680	immediate availability, rather than just on-call, in addition to certain specialists.
479680	486240	Then, those most advanced, level one centers have everything conceivably necessary for any trauma
486240	491520	case, including specialists across all fields, and the ability to treat a case all the way from
491520	498240	initial presentation through rehabilitation—which can be a multi-year process. Level one trauma
498240	503440	centers are incredibly expensive to run, and therefore need a critical mass of patients to
503440	510560	cover costs. Consequently, it's very possible to be more than 600 miles or 950 kilometers from one
510560	517680	while in the lower 48, or 2,000 miles or 3,200 kilometers from one while in Alaska. Due to this
517680	524000	potential distance, a major trauma case outside a major city would typically go first to a level
524000	529600	three, four, or five trauma center, which are far more commonplace, where they'd be stabilized and
529600	534320	evaluated to determine whether they need to be transferred to a more advanced facility.
534320	541200	So, someone in a vehicle crash in the San Rafael Swell on I-70 in Utah would likely first go to
541200	546240	the Moab Regional Hospital, which is a level four center. If the doctors and nurses there
546240	550720	determined the patient needed a higher level of care, they would be transferred—in this case,
550720	555920	to St. Mary's Hospital in Grand Junction, Colorado, which is a level two center. Then,
555920	561120	if that hospital determined the patient had such complex and specialized injuries
561120	565760	that even they couldn't handle it, the patient would likely be transferred to Denver Health's
565760	571040	level one trauma center. Since each of these transfers would take hours by ground,
571040	576640	the decision would almost certainly be made for major trauma cases to use an air ambulance.
577280	584080	This is the bread and butter of the air ambulance business, and surely this saves lives, right?
585040	591840	Well, yes and no. In one study of major trauma patients suffering from certain high mortality
591840	598640	injuries, patients admitted to level two centers had a 29.7% mortality rate, while those admitted
598640	606480	to a level one center only die 25.4% of the time. More advanced trauma centers do save more lives,
606480	611600	and therefore conventional wisdom would assume that transfers to higher level centers save lives,
611600	615760	but conventional wisdom almost always misses the nuance of a situation.
616480	622160	According to another study, some quarter of adults and half of children transferred to level
622160	626800	one trauma centers are brought there unnecessarily—in other words, they've been
626800	632960	subject to secondary overtriage, where the more advanced center ends up discharging them after
632960	637040	completing treatment that a less advanced center would have been plenty capable of.
637840	644240	Now, a certain level of secondary overtriage is to be expected and even encouraged—after all,
644240	650880	it's better to be safe than sorry—but again, we need that nuance. For an overtriaged patient,
650880	655760	they would have survived if they had stayed in a level three center, for example, and they did
655760	661520	survive when they ended up in a level one center, so the health outcome was the same, but for those
661520	669280	patients transferred by an air ambulance, they received something else—an absolutely massive
669920	676720	bill. A conservative estimate puts the average price of an air ambulance flight in the US
676720	684080	at $27,900. Others put that figure even higher, well into the $30,000 or $40,000,
684080	688960	meaning it's very possible, and even common, for someone to be charged more for a quick
688960	695680	hospital ride to or from the hospital than they make in a year. Another counterargument, though—a
695680	702000	human life, to the holder of that life, is essentially invaluable—any cost to save it
702000	710080	is worth it. But the problem is not the cost—it's the price. The cost for air ambulance companies to
710080	716160	operate a given flight, according to the companies themselves, is somewhere between $6,000 and $13,000.
717120	725440	That shouldn't be possible—as in, quite literally, the rules of economics say that that gap between
725440	731520	cost and price shouldn't be possible, because in a normal free market, for normal products,
731520	737920	competition would drive down prices far closer to costs since lower prices increase demand,
737920	743520	and companies can increase profits with greater market share, but the American air ambulance market
743520	750080	is very far from normal. Every product in the world can be mapped onto a graph that looks like
750080	757680	this—price on the y-axis, quantity purchased on the x. This is what a normal product looks like—as
757680	764640	price goes down, quantity purchased goes up. There are some exceptions to this—for example, certain
764640	769360	luxury goods plot like this on the graph, where higher prices actually stimulate higher demand,
769440	776480	to an extent—although almost no product will look like this. This, however, is the relationship
776480	783840	between price and demand for air ambulances—as price increases, it has zero impact on demand.
783840	788720	It's easy to understand why—the people purchasing and paying for air ambulance flights
788720	795040	have no agency over whether or not to do so. The decision to use an air ambulance is made by
795040	801360	first responders or doctors, not the often unconscious patient, so there is a complete
801360	808480	lack of market forces working to lower the price. When a free market isn't working to regulate the
808480	814000	allocation of goods and services into the most societally advantageous configuration—which
814000	818400	in this case would be the greatest possible availability of air ambulances at the lowest
818400	825280	possible prices—economists would describe that as a market failure. In cases of market failure,
825280	830800	even the most staunchly libertarian economist would tend to agree that the only solution,
830800	836560	at that point, would be external intervention—typically by the government—and so this
836560	843600	massive, critical industry charging vulnerable people massive, crippling prices can't possibly
843600	850800	be completely unregulated. Right? Wrong. In fact, not only is the air ambulance
850800	858160	industry not regulated, but it seemingly can't be. You see, back in 1978, Congress passed the
858160	864080	Airline Deregulation Act, ending the government's ability to regulate the fares of airlines.
864080	869360	This led to a dramatic decrease in air fares and a dramatic increase in flights—essentially,
869360	872560	it paved the way for the US to become the world's largest aviation market—but
873360	880240	when it sought to deregulate airlines, that truly meant all airlines. Through the years,
880240	885280	as various states have attempted to fix the market failure of the air ambulance industry,
885280	891200	providers have successfully argued in court time and time again that because they are technically
891200	896320	airlines, and because the Airline Deregulation Act prevents states from regulating air fares,
896880	904720	states cannot regulate the prices air ambulances charge. There is truly no limit to what they can
904720	911600	charge. But wait, there is another, unique market force in the American healthcare industry that
911600	919440	could solve this problem—that of insurance. Right? You see, most insurers in the US have
919440	925360	a network of providers that they cover, and if a patient uses an out-of-network provider,
925360	930080	they are charged a far higher rate, or are subject to an annual spending cap.
930080	935040	In non-emergency circumstances, it's often possible to find an in-network provider,
935040	939440	and many states, and recently the federal government too, have passed legislation
939440	945280	limiting out-of-network bills for emergencies, but of course, thanks to the Airline Deregulation Act,
945280	953760	those don't apply to air ambulances. In the US, some 77% of air ambulance flights are billed
953760	958960	out-of-network, meaning patients are on the hook for all, or at least the vast majority,
958960	967360	of those $30,000 or $40,000 or $50,000 air ambulance bills. This is, once again,
967360	973840	a symptom of market failure. For most medical services, insured patients have the ability to
973840	978960	choose which provider they go to, they have the ability to choose to go to an in-network provider,
978960	984240	which is a market force that pushes providers to accept as many types of insurance as possible—if
984240	990480	they didn't, they would lose business—and those insurers have the scale to negotiate prices down.
990480	996000	With air ambulances, though, since patients have zero ability to choose which provider they use,
996000	1001440	or even whether they use one at all, there are no market forces pushing providers to bring more
1001440	1007520	insurers in-network. In fact, they often get paid more from out-of-network patients,
1007520	1013200	meaning they not only lack incentive to bring insurers in-network, but market forces are pushing
1013200	1019680	them to minimize the number of carriers in their network. Air ambulance providers, and more
1019680	1025440	specifically, the private equity firms that now own the majority of them, have figured out just
1025440	1032800	how exploitable this market failure is. Since 2000, the number of air ambulances in the US
1032800	1038400	has more than doubled to nearly 900, and the average annual flight hours per helicopter
1038400	1045840	have dropped from a high of 600 in 2003 to almost 450, as these companies further saturate the
1045840	1053360	market. In the same time period, average prices have more than tripled. It's tough to get a good
1053360	1058000	gauge of just how much these companies are profiting on the plight of Americans in the most
1058000	1063280	vulnerable moment of their lives, largely because almost all the major players in the industry
1063280	1067920	are now owned by private equity firms and therefore don't report their financial results.
1068480	1075440	What's clear, though, is this—in 2017, according to one study, air ambulances owned by private
1075440	1082080	equity firms charged about double what those owned by hospitals or non-profits did. The cost
1082080	1087600	to operate non-profit and for-profit air ambulances are not dramatically different,
1087600	1094240	so the only reasonable conclusion is that these private, for-profit air ambulances are pocketing
1094240	1101040	thousands upon thousands of dollars in profit per patient. There is nothing stopping this
1101040	1106480	industry from charging higher and higher rates—not market forces, not regulation,
1107040	1111440	nothing—and so these private equity companies, having realized this,
1111440	1117200	will keep jacking up prices and turning highway accidents and heart attacks into higher returns
1117200	1123040	for their investors. Right now, this is an industry that can't be stopped.
1123760	1129760	There is, however, potentially momentum for reform with the recently passed No Surprises Act,
1129760	1135840	which caps out-of-network charges and emergencies, but it's unclear exactly how this can and will
1135840	1141600	impact the air ambulance industry when it takes effect in 2022, given the protections of the
1141600	1150080	Airline Deregulation Act. Any doctor knows the words, primum non nocere, a Latin phrase that
1150080	1158000	translates to, first, do no harm. It's a maxim that guides every med school bioethics course,
1158000	1164640	and it essentially recognizes that in medicine, it is possible to do more harm than good.
1164640	1171280	It's why, when someone reaches the final days or hours of their life, and the outcome is certain,
1171280	1177280	the decision is typically made to withhold treatment—because it can only harm. Treatments
1177280	1183040	come with physical, emotional, and financial burdens, so they're simply not worth it when
1183040	1190000	the path towards death is irreversible. When air ambulances are used, the goal is to reverse that
1190000	1197760	path, and in many cases, they do. However, the best research into the matter estimates that for
1197760	1206800	every 100 air ambulance flights, four lives are saved. That means that in 96 cases out of 100,
1206800	1214080	the patient or their next of kin walks out of the hospital having lost a year of income. They walk
1214080	1218960	out having pushed back retirement by a year, having lost the ability to send their kids to
1218960	1227040	college, or by a house, or gone on vacation. They've lost a non-trivial quantity of quality
1227040	1235280	of life. In 96 cases out of 100, doctors using private air ambulance providers are forced to
1235280	1242080	violate their Hippocratic Oath—they are forced to make a split-second decision that does harm,
1242080	1248880	and changes lives for the worse, all because, at the end of the line, there's some wealthy investor
1248960	1255440	in some private equity firm who prefers a 10.5% return on investment over 10.4%,
1256560	1264560	and nobody's doing anything to stop them. Any long-time Wendover viewer will have heard
