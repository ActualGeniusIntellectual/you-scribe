1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,860
Here's a lie—American outdoor recreation is doing better than ever.

2
00:00:04,860 --> 00:00:07,660
And here are some statistics to back up that lie.

3
00:00:07,660 --> 00:00:12,320
These are annual National Park Service visitor figures in the US since 2000—the numbers

4
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:15,300
going up and to the right, the good way.

5
00:00:15,300 --> 00:00:19,020
More Americans than ever are visiting national park sites.

6
00:00:19,020 --> 00:00:23,860
Take the NPS's historic and recreation sites out of this data, and just focus on the 63

7
00:00:23,860 --> 00:00:28,140
nature-focused national parks and the trends even stronger—the number of visitors is

8
00:00:28,140 --> 00:00:31,820
going up and up and up.

9
00:00:31,820 --> 00:00:34,600
Along with attendance, spending is rising too.

10
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:39,580
With $20.5 billion spent in the parks and gateway communities surrounding them, 2021

11
00:00:39,580 --> 00:00:44,300
saw a return to the all-time highs that defined the late 2010s.

12
00:00:44,300 --> 00:00:47,820
Jobs in the parks and jobs created by the parks also bounced back from COVID-stricken

13
00:00:47,820 --> 00:00:51,040
2020 and returned to near-record numbers too.

14
00:00:51,040 --> 00:00:55,460
In visitors, spending, and employment, the National Park Service—the single institution

15
00:00:55,460 --> 00:01:00,240
that most clearly embodies the alignment of Americans and nature—has never looked

16
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:02,080
so strong.

17
00:01:02,080 --> 00:01:06,920
Furthering the lie, the trend of Americans pouring outdoors is bigger than the parks.

18
00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:11,480
2021 was a massive year for the American outdoor industry as a whole.

19
00:01:11,480 --> 00:01:18,660
It generated $862 billion, it accounted for 1.9% of America's GDP, it employed 3% of

20
00:01:18,660 --> 00:01:23,080
working Americans, and the sector's growth rate tripled the pace of the rest of the American

21
00:01:23,080 --> 00:01:24,280
economy.

22
00:01:24,340 --> 00:01:28,340
Whether it's in national parks, state parks, city parks, forest service land, Bureau of

23
00:01:28,340 --> 00:01:32,980
Land Management land, or not land at all but rivers and shorelines, Americans are visiting

24
00:01:32,980 --> 00:01:38,660
the outdoors, spending money on the outdoors, and working in the outdoors more than ever.

25
00:01:38,660 --> 00:01:42,060
The problem is, it's crushing the outdoors.

26
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:45,980
Here's the bit of nuance that these numbers miss.

27
00:01:45,980 --> 00:01:50,380
The people going into nature in such massive numbers are increasingly aggregating in an

28
00:01:50,380 --> 00:01:52,820
incredibly limited number of sites.

29
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:58,240
In fact, flip how you interpret those national park numbers, and they point to a real problem—more

30
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:03,000
and more, everyone is going to the same place.

31
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,860
Perhaps then it's not a great celebration of the American outdoors that Yellowstone

32
00:02:06,860 --> 00:02:11,800
nearly hit 5 million visitors in 2021, or that Great Smoky surpassed 14 million, or

33
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:16,320
that four of Utah's heavily-marketed Mighty Five National Parks—Arches, Canyonlands,

34
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:21,080
Capitol Reef, and Zion—all hit visitation records in 2021.

35
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:25,140
Perhaps it's a tragic lack of creativity that in a country with more than a quarter

36
00:02:25,140 --> 00:02:30,220
of its area designated as public lands, hundreds of millions are flowing into the exact same

37
00:02:30,220 --> 00:02:32,580
handful of places.

38
00:02:32,580 --> 00:02:37,500
Just down Highway 191 from the turnoffs of two of Utah's most celebrated natural areas,

39
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:41,800
Canyonlands and Arches, is the 5,000-person town of Moab.

40
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:45,740
Four hours from Salt Lake, more than five from Denver, and six-plus from Albuquerque,

41
00:02:45,740 --> 00:02:49,420
Phoenix, and Las Vegas, Moab is far from anywhere.

42
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:55,240
Yet, this tiny town, and its world-class climbing, its year-round camping, its endless slick-rock

43
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:59,440
bike trails and off-roading routes, along with its awe-inspiring parks, pull some three

44
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:03,280
to five million visitors a year from the world over.

45
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:06,720
And while business has broadly been good in the past two decades as the outdoor industry

46
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:11,940
has taken off, the always-rising numbers are now pushing the town to the brink.

47
00:03:11,940 --> 00:03:14,880
The unexpected consequences start with the parks.

48
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:19,220
A decade ago, Utah launched an international marketing blitz to show the world it was more

49
00:03:19,220 --> 00:03:22,080
than brown dirt and salt lakes.

50
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:26,320
The ads, billboards, and commercials that spread around the world worked, and Moab,

51
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:31,060
in turn, became the gateway to southern Utah's natural beauty—the town where you'd base

52
00:03:31,060 --> 00:03:35,000
your visit out of, where you'd have breakfast before going into the parks, grab snacks for

53
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:38,360
your planned hikes, and eat dinner after a long day out.

54
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:43,120
It felt like a win-win-win—more dollars spent in the state, further economic growth

55
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:47,320
for the former uranium town, and more visitors exploring the outdoors.

56
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:50,460
But then-visitor numbers just kept growing.

57
00:03:50,460 --> 00:03:55,020
Recently, Arches has been doing something it nearly never did—it's been closing

58
00:03:55,020 --> 00:03:57,860
its gates, on account of crowding.

59
00:03:57,860 --> 00:04:03,340
This has happened before only on the busiest of holidays, but in 2020, it became the norm.

60
00:04:03,340 --> 00:04:07,940
In September of that year, the park told visitors at the gate to come back later on 16 separate

61
00:04:07,940 --> 00:04:08,940
days.

62
00:04:08,940 --> 00:04:12,620
It was a record for closures in a month, but a record that didn't stand long as the park

63
00:04:12,620 --> 00:04:16,900
then closed its gates every day for the first 17 days of October.

64
00:04:16,900 --> 00:04:21,520
Arches, a park of nearly 80,000 acres, was simply overflowing.

65
00:04:21,520 --> 00:04:26,080
In the surge's wake, the park has experimented with advanced ticketing during peak season,

66
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:30,120
and has worked to communicate the benefits of showing up either early or late.

67
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:35,240
But the park doesn't have any easy answers—it's expanded the infrastructure where it can,

68
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:40,320
it's added parking, but it can't build another delicate arch.

69
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:42,520
Visitors, for their part, have found alternatives.

70
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:44,320
They've gone over to Canyonlands.

71
00:04:44,740 --> 00:04:48,780
They've gone to Dead Horse State Park, which now itself has reached over a million annual

72
00:04:48,780 --> 00:04:49,780
visitors.

73
00:04:49,780 --> 00:04:53,540
They now are turned back at the gate and search directions for the once-unknown swimming hole

74
00:04:53,540 --> 00:04:54,780
on the edge of town.

75
00:04:54,780 --> 00:04:58,660
They miss out on camping reservations in the park, so the overnight crowd spills into the

76
00:04:58,660 --> 00:05:03,100
Bureau of Land Management campgrounds here, where the Forest Service lands here.

77
00:05:03,100 --> 00:05:06,240
The spillover is causing chaos.

78
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:09,980
Moab has traffic now, its restaurants are short-staffed, and its employees are getting

79
00:05:09,980 --> 00:05:14,380
squeezed out because long-term rentals are being converted to short-term ones.

80
00:05:14,380 --> 00:05:18,320
For residents, it's too much—they're tired of losing out on housing and listening

81
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:22,440
all day and night to noisy off-roaders driving through town to their next trailhead.

82
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:26,960
They've come to a conclusion that would have been unimaginable two decades ago.

83
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:31,360
They believe the booming outdoor industry that's enveloped their town is now hurting

84
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:34,440
it and the landscape more than it's helping.

85
00:05:34,900 --> 00:05:40,960
In a 2022 survey, 59% of Moab-area residents polled said that quality of life had declined

86
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:44,420
on account of tourism, while more than half of respondents believed that the negatives

87
00:05:44,420 --> 00:05:48,540
of tourism were now outweighing the positives—and this was a survey group where nearly half

88
00:05:48,540 --> 00:05:52,020
of the respondents said that their income relied on tourism.

89
00:05:52,020 --> 00:05:55,900
It's not just the town that's at its wits' ends either.

90
00:05:55,900 --> 00:05:59,280
National park staff are stretched thin educating first-time visitors on how to move through

91
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:02,820
parks without damaging the cryptobiotic soil, while also trying to keep up with all the

92
00:06:02,820 --> 00:06:05,640
trash and waste these visitors create.

93
00:06:05,640 --> 00:06:09,840
The task is even taller for Bureau of Land Management staff, who, based out of this single

94
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:14,640
building are expected to inspect, manage, and look after all this BLM land, and the

95
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:18,600
Forest Service Rangers based out of this even smaller renovated house who are responsible

96
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:23,160
for this impossibly large amount of territory that's becoming ever more popular with the

97
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:25,080
outdoor crowd.

98
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:28,080
Fundamentally, Moab has changed.

99
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:33,380
What was once the spot to get off the beaten trail, to explore Red Rock Desert, to meander,

100
00:06:33,380 --> 00:06:37,900
to get away, has become the spot to sit in line.

101
00:06:37,900 --> 00:06:42,700
And yet, people are still sitting in line, in unmatched numbers.

102
00:06:42,700 --> 00:06:47,900
And it's all for this—to watch the sun rise over Delicate Arch, to watch the light

103
00:06:47,900 --> 00:06:53,540
fill up the valley through Mesa Arch, to cool off from the desert heat in Mill Creek.

104
00:06:53,540 --> 00:06:58,060
People wait and wait and elbow their way into position to do these things, and more importantly,

105
00:06:58,060 --> 00:07:01,000
to take pictures of them doing these things.

106
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:06,160
Today, an increasing number of people are going outside, not to get lost or to explore,

107
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:07,960
but to be seen.

108
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:11,880
Tourists jockey for camera position in Arches and Canyonlands to show their Instagram followers

109
00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:12,880
they've been there.

110
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:17,200
They do the same at Horseshoe Bend, which now charges parking fees at its massive lot

111
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:20,020
that was just a dirt pull-off 20 years ago.

112
00:07:20,020 --> 00:07:23,640
Not far away, they do the same at Antelope Canyon, waiting their turn to throw sand in

113
00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:26,200
the air and hope the light catches it right.

114
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:31,180
They sit in endless lines at Zion National Park 2, waiting for hours to climb and document

115
00:07:31,180 --> 00:07:32,820
the climb up Angel's Landing.

116
00:07:32,820 --> 00:07:37,380
In a culture where experience increasingly conveys value, the long waits are worth the

117
00:07:37,380 --> 00:07:42,500
payoff—the picture, the geotag, the proof that you too have been to America's most

118
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:44,860
iconic viewpoints.

119
00:07:44,860 --> 00:07:49,540
For the national parks, this sudden virality of a few specific spots is a massive headache,

120
00:07:49,540 --> 00:07:54,380
as seemingly overnight, they need more toilets, more parking, more resources expended towards

121
00:07:54,380 --> 00:07:56,660
specific corners of their parks.

122
00:07:56,660 --> 00:08:00,760
For areas more remote and more difficult to access, like Idaho's Kirkham Hot Springs,

123
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:04,960
Oregon's Opal Creek, or Colorado's Conundrum Hot Springs, the job of managing these viral

124
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:08,840
areas—keeping them litter-free and providing proper parking and bathroom facilities at

125
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:13,120
the trailhead so the landscapes don't get ruined—is becoming nearly impossible as

126
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:17,320
visitor numbers rise and location names spread like wildfire online.

127
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:22,260
How, for instance, can a Forest Service employee possibly keep an eye on Conundrum Hot Springs

128
00:08:22,260 --> 00:08:27,760
when it's a 9-mile or 14-kilometer hike climbing 3,000 feet or 900 meters of gain

129
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:30,800
just to get to the springs in the first place?

130
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:35,560
The social media craze of documenting experiences in the outdoors has spread beyond Instagram

131
00:08:35,560 --> 00:08:36,560
and Twitter too.

132
00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:40,760
There's Strava, where users can track and map their activities, host them for all to

133
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:44,640
see, and compete with the rest of the community to see who can bike, hike, and run through

134
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:46,280
segments of trail the fastest.

135
00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:50,440
There's AllTrails that provides maps and directions, along with user photos and reviews

136
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:52,500
of practically any hike out there.

137
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:56,320
There's a similar product for mountain bikers called MTB Project, and a similar product

138
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:58,420
for trail runners called Trail Run Project.

139
00:08:58,420 --> 00:09:02,700
There's an app for every outdoor pursuit that puts maps and critical information in

140
00:09:02,700 --> 00:09:06,980
a user's pocket, and provides incentive to go out, hit the trail, and size oneself

141
00:09:06,980 --> 00:09:10,500
up against everyone else out there doing the same thing.

142
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:14,820
Whether competing for times, likes, kudos, or clout, social media has reimagined the

143
00:09:14,820 --> 00:09:18,860
outdoors—it's made the busy spots busier, and it's forcing land managers to do what

144
00:09:18,860 --> 00:09:24,800
no land manager wants to do—place restrictions on access.

145
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:29,080
Each and every time a barrier to outdoor access is implemented, a different version of the

146
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:34,840
same debate plays out—who's to blame, will it work, is it fair, and is any of that

147
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:36,840
even met?

148
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:39,640
This is Maine's Baxter State Park.

149
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:43,840
Confusingly, it is not, in fact, a Maine State Park.

150
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:48,840
Rather, it operates as a trust—a legal arrangement that ensures usage of an asset as the trust's

151
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:52,740
trustee, in this case Governor Percival Proctor Baxter, intended.

152
00:09:52,740 --> 00:09:53,980
He wrote, quote,

153
00:09:53,980 --> 00:09:55,620
Man is born to die.

154
00:09:55,620 --> 00:09:56,780
His works are short-lived.

155
00:09:56,780 --> 00:10:03,740
Buildings crumble, monuments decay, wealth vanishes, but Katahdin, in all its glory,

156
00:10:03,740 --> 00:10:07,260
forever shall remain the mountain of the people of Maine.

157
00:10:07,260 --> 00:10:14,220
Katahdin, the towering 5,269-foot, 1,606-meter peak in the center of the park, stretches

158
00:10:14,220 --> 00:10:21,960
higher than any other mountain in the state, but unfurling 2,198.4 miles or 3,538 kilometers

159
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:27,400
to its south is the Appalachian Trail—perhaps the most legendary long-distance hiking trail

160
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:29,000
in the world.

161
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:33,820
In this context, though, legendary status is not necessarily a good thing.

162
00:10:33,820 --> 00:10:37,380
The number of thru-hikers, those walking the entire length from Springer Mountain, Georgia

163
00:10:37,380 --> 00:10:41,700
to Mount Katahdin, Maine, has steadily grown since the trail's inception, accelerated

164
00:10:41,700 --> 00:10:45,400
in growth through the 21st century as word of the trek spread through forums, videos,

165
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:50,000
and social media, then accelerated once again in 2015 with the release of the movie A Walk

166
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:54,080
in the Woods, an adaptation of Bill Bryson's book about his AT thru-hike.

167
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:58,620
Now, the Appalachian Trail has never been a lightly-used trail.

168
00:10:58,620 --> 00:11:02,440
It snakes its way through the most densely populated region of America, starting just

169
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:07,280
75 minutes from Atlanta, passing an hour away from DC, even boasting a direct train connection

170
00:11:07,280 --> 00:11:08,280
to NYC.

171
00:11:08,780 --> 00:11:13,240
Therefore, across the trail, the couple thousand annual thru-hikers have always been vastly

172
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:18,900
outnumbered by hordes of day and section hikers—with one major exception.

173
00:11:18,900 --> 00:11:22,940
Maine is the least densely populated state on the East Coast, and in the final weeks

174
00:11:22,940 --> 00:11:28,380
and days of their trips, thru-hikers start to pass through true wilderness—no towns,

175
00:11:28,380 --> 00:11:31,300
no cell service, hardly even road crossings.

176
00:11:31,300 --> 00:11:35,260
In fact, the last paved road they'll cross is the first one they'll have seen in a

177
00:11:35,260 --> 00:11:40,160
week and sits right on the border of Baxter State Park—by far the strictest one on the

178
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:42,640
entire trail stretch.

179
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:48,600
After months crossing heavily-used and loosely-regulated land, Baxter is an anomaly.

180
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:53,640
Inside, infrastructure is limited—no electricity, no running water, no paved roads—and the

181
00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:55,360
rules are endless.

182
00:11:55,360 --> 00:12:00,500
No pets, no motorcycles, no outside firewood, no soap, no groups of more than 12, no vehicles

183
00:12:00,500 --> 00:12:04,820
longer than 22 feet, no children under 6 above the treeline—it's about as close to true

184
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:08,640
wilderness one can get in a managed park, and the park's authority works hard to keep

185
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:09,880
it that way.

186
00:12:09,880 --> 00:12:14,460
Therefore, Baxter strictly regulates visitor numbers, requiring elusive reservations for

187
00:12:14,460 --> 00:12:20,160
parking at most trailheads and sleeping in all campgrounds, with one notable exception.

188
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:24,500
Reflecting the unpredictability of their arrival date, the park long allowed some Appalachian

189
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:29,700
trail thru-hikers to enter unrestricted, granting the first 12 each day the right to pay $10

190
00:12:29,700 --> 00:12:34,460
to camp at the base of Mount Katahdin before the final miles of their months-long treks.

191
00:12:34,460 --> 00:12:38,260
After all, across all those months leading up to this moment, no matter which park the

192
00:12:38,260 --> 00:12:42,460
AT passed through, not a single trailside campground would have required reservations,

193
00:12:42,460 --> 00:12:47,380
meaning while this was an exception to Baxter's system, it was the norm for the ATs.

194
00:12:47,380 --> 00:12:52,580
In fact, this very norm—the boundless, uninhibited ability to simply point north, walk as far

195
00:12:52,580 --> 00:12:58,180
as possible, sleep, then do it again—was considered central to the allure of the trail.

196
00:12:58,180 --> 00:13:03,100
But, according to Baxter State Park, that allure, or at least the knowledge of that

197
00:13:03,100 --> 00:13:05,780
allure, had grown too strong.

198
00:13:05,780 --> 00:13:08,620
The public rhetoric escalated.

199
00:13:08,620 --> 00:13:13,540
Baxter alleged that, among myriad other concerns, AT hikers most flagrantly violated the park's

200
00:13:13,540 --> 00:13:15,700
group size limits and alcohol ban.

201
00:13:15,700 --> 00:13:20,200
After months on the same trail, hikers typically operated as one big nomadic social circle

202
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:24,500
by the finish, leading many to want to finish together and celebrate at Katahdin's summit,

203
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:28,380
leading to a party-like atmosphere that the park authority considered incompatible with

204
00:13:28,380 --> 00:13:30,700
its conservation-first goals.

205
00:13:30,740 --> 00:13:35,460
Ultimately, the straw that broke the camel's back appeared to be the incident in 2015,

206
00:13:35,460 --> 00:13:39,680
when legendary ultra-marathoner Scott Jurek completed a monumental feat.

207
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:44,800
He had run the length of the trail in just 46 days—a new record that broke down to

208
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:47,900
nearly two marathons' distance per day.

209
00:13:47,900 --> 00:13:51,500
Given the scale of the feat, a horde of media followed him to the summit, where he celebrated

210
00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:54,020
his achievement by spraying and drinking champagne.

211
00:13:54,020 --> 00:13:59,620
In acknowledgement of this, the park rewarded him with three legal summits—one for alcohol

212
00:13:59,620 --> 00:14:03,240
consumption, against the park's rules, one for littering, for the champagne that

213
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:07,460
had been spilled, and one for a group size violation—since the media that followed

214
00:14:07,460 --> 00:14:10,380
totaled above the park's cap of 12.

215
00:14:10,380 --> 00:14:14,960
Inevitably, furious debate followed on whether some spilled champagne constituted littering,

216
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:18,740
whether media following a soon-to-be record holder constituted a true group that Jurek

217
00:14:18,740 --> 00:14:23,020
was responsible for, and most of all on whether it was even right to cite the man for a short

218
00:14:23,020 --> 00:14:25,580
celebration of an all-time record.

219
00:14:25,580 --> 00:14:29,620
Jurek, on principle, took this to court where the group size and littering citations were

220
00:14:29,620 --> 00:14:33,460
dismissed, but this only escalated the larger conversation.

221
00:14:33,460 --> 00:14:38,420
Was the Appalachian Trail even compatible with Baxter's legally enshrined conservation-focused

222
00:14:38,420 --> 00:14:42,360
mission, and were Baxter's strict rules even justified by their conservation mission

223
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:44,100
in the first place?

224
00:14:44,100 --> 00:14:47,180
The Baxter State Park Authority clearly wasn't waiting for an answer, though.

225
00:14:47,180 --> 00:14:51,860
They abruptly announced that, after nearly a century of limitless access along the entire

226
00:14:51,860 --> 00:14:57,380
stretch of the trail, Appalachian Trail thru-hikers would now be capped.

227
00:14:57,380 --> 00:15:04,780
As of 2017, only 3,150 would be allowed to complete their trek atop Mount Katahdin.

228
00:15:04,780 --> 00:15:09,020
Inevitably, this sparked uproar in the AT community.

229
00:15:09,020 --> 00:15:13,120
Hikers were near paranoid over the prospect of walking over 2,000 miles from Georgia and

230
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:15,860
getting turned away in the final 15.

231
00:15:15,860 --> 00:15:19,620
They argued that the couple thousand annual thru-hikers couldn't possibly have a notable

232
00:15:19,620 --> 00:15:23,620
impact compared to the tens of thousands of car-based visitors each summer.

233
00:15:23,620 --> 00:15:28,280
They argued that, despite their legal right, Baxter State Park was simply just wrong to

234
00:15:28,280 --> 00:15:31,800
throw a near century of precedent out the window.

235
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:34,180
The park came back with a simple argument.

236
00:15:34,180 --> 00:15:38,300
Percival Baxter very clearly indicated in his trust documents that the park's primary

237
00:15:38,300 --> 00:15:42,620
purpose was conservation, yet left no instructions as to the Appalachian Trail.

238
00:15:42,620 --> 00:15:47,580
Therefore, both in practice and in law, conservation came first.

239
00:15:47,580 --> 00:15:53,300
Ultimately, there was nothing AT hikers or the Appalachian Trail Conservancy could do.

240
00:15:53,300 --> 00:15:57,660
Some complained, others sympathized with Baxter's position, understanding that the park had

241
00:15:57,660 --> 00:16:02,440
a different mission than the trail, and, as their host, Baxter had every right to implement

242
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:05,420
any rule or restriction they wanted.

243
00:16:05,420 --> 00:16:10,100
The showdown in Baxter was, in many ways, an accentuated microcosm of the debates happening

244
00:16:10,100 --> 00:16:12,100
more widely in the outdoors.

245
00:16:12,100 --> 00:16:16,440
It's a unique case in which one of the most heavily trafficked trails in the world, hosting

246
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:20,560
at least 3 million people on a portion each year, interacts with one of the most strictly

247
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:26,220
regulated parks in the world, made possible uniquely by its independent funding and management.

248
00:16:26,220 --> 00:16:30,080
Not all the debates happen in such stark terms, where the ultimate threat throughout has been

249
00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:35,200
the expulsion of the trail from the park, but it is the same debate—what sort of access

250
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:37,320
should humans have to nature?

251
00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:39,400
How much is too much?

252
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:43,560
There's essentially zero unmanaged nature left on earth.

253
00:16:43,560 --> 00:16:48,400
With limited exception, there just isn't empty public land operating without any regulatory

254
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:49,400
body.

255
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:53,280
Each and every one of these regulatory bodies picks somewhere between no access, pristine

256
00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:57,720
wilderness restricting all human access, which itself is not even the natural state, and

257
00:16:57,720 --> 00:17:02,940
unlimited access—another near impossible construct since infrastructure naturally caps

258
00:17:02,940 --> 00:17:04,600
access.

259
00:17:04,600 --> 00:17:06,680
There appears no perfect answer.

260
00:17:06,680 --> 00:17:11,400
You see, eliminating human access to nature has consequences.

261
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:15,820
There is a seemingly endless body of academic research linking exposure to nature with positive

262
00:17:15,820 --> 00:17:20,240
effects on mental health, and it all seems to loosely link back to the biophilia theory—the

263
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:24,320
idea that humans have some innate affinity to proximity to nature.

264
00:17:24,320 --> 00:17:29,640
There is an evolutionary explanation for this—after all, our ancestors were more likely to survive

265
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:33,320
in resource-rich environments with lots of other forms of life.

266
00:17:33,320 --> 00:17:36,960
But perhaps stronger evidence is found in today's world where the average human lives

267
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:40,760
in an urban area cut off from easy access to nature.

268
00:17:40,760 --> 00:17:43,620
Why do people spend time and money to raise pets?

269
00:17:43,620 --> 00:17:49,200
Why do people prefer live houseplains to less expensive artificial versions, even when indistinguishable?

270
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:53,460
Why do people drive for hours to walk in the woods when they could just walk down the sidewalk?

271
00:17:53,460 --> 00:17:57,560
The questions about nature's curious draw could go on and on, but on the flip side,

272
00:17:57,560 --> 00:18:01,200
there are studies linking time and nature to higher levels of creativity, lower levels

273
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:06,480
of stress, improved mood, and above all, higher self-reported personal well-being.

274
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:10,640
And then, beyond the personal, nature-connectedness is linked to higher concern for nature's

275
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:14,240
well-being, which, in a world threatened by the continual destruction of wilderness,

276
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:18,320
at least theoretically implies humans with better access to nature will do more to save

277
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:19,680
it.

278
00:18:19,680 --> 00:18:22,580
But unlimited access has its issues too.

279
00:18:22,580 --> 00:18:27,420
To start, many of those psychological benefits are linked to isolation—linked to the downstream

280
00:18:27,420 --> 00:18:30,600
effects of self-sufficiency in a wild space.

281
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:34,800
Hiking angels landing with back-to-back traffic is absolutely a different experience with

282
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:37,320
a lesser benefit than hiking it alone.

283
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:42,320
Therefore, while impossible to quantify, there is absolutely a point where the marginal benefit

284
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:46,400
that one additional person gains from being allowed on the trail is outweighed by the

285
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:51,800
sum of the marginal detriment everyone else encounters due to a busier trail.

286
00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:54,400
But then there are the more practical concerns.

287
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:57,800
Nature can be a dangerous environment where risks need to be properly mitigated, but the

288
00:18:57,800 --> 00:19:02,180
rise of the outdoors as a lifestyle trait or social media backdrop has perhaps masked

289
00:19:02,180 --> 00:19:03,180
this truth.

290
00:19:03,180 --> 00:19:07,000
Baxter State Park, for example, justifies much of its heavy-handedness with its need

291
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,520
to keep visitors safe.

292
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:13,220
Katahdin is a well-known, yet high-risk mountain in a region of America with relatively tamer

293
00:19:13,220 --> 00:19:14,220
nature.

294
00:19:14,220 --> 00:19:18,460
A hiker from Boston, for example, is likely not accustomed to the level of isolation or

295
00:19:18,460 --> 00:19:22,040
exposure that Katahdin presents, because there just aren't that many mountains with the

296
00:19:22,040 --> 00:19:24,620
same risk factor in the region.

297
00:19:24,620 --> 00:19:28,400
The reservations-only system means no one can make the spontaneous decision to hike

298
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:32,540
Baxter without planning—they'll spend days or weeks researching before even getting

299
00:19:32,540 --> 00:19:34,480
to parking reservations.

300
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:39,280
Upon arrival, Baxter Rangers are trained to essentially triage hikers at Katahdin trailheads,

301
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:43,520
checking whether they have adequate footwear, clothing, supplies, and asking questions that,

302
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:47,540
according to the park's director, are designed to subtly spook them—get them in the mindset

303
00:19:47,540 --> 00:19:51,840
that what they're about to do has risk and isn't just a walk in the park.

304
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:56,460
Then, as a final filter, this foreboding sign is placed a half-mile up the trail to be read

305
00:19:56,460 --> 00:20:00,200
once the initial excitement of the day has worn off, and a more rational brain perhaps

306
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:01,760
takes over.

307
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:06,680
Despite these precautions, roughly one in every 2,000 Baxter visitors requires medical

308
00:20:06,680 --> 00:20:11,100
or search and rescue resources, far above the nationwide average, and more than 60 people

309
00:20:11,100 --> 00:20:14,440
have died while climbing Maine's tallest peak.

310
00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:19,120
Now, the question of how high the barrier to entry should be is a tricky one, as the

311
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:24,760
outdoors is a domain dominated by a core demographic—it's primarily used by people who are wealthier,

312
00:20:24,760 --> 00:20:26,440
white, and male.

313
00:20:26,440 --> 00:20:30,120
This is something that the outdoor recreation industry especially is working to counter,

314
00:20:30,120 --> 00:20:33,600
since it makes it tougher to generate political support and limits their potential customer

315
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:34,600
base.

316
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:39,880
But it's no wonder why the outdoors has unintentionally been exclusionary—essentially,

317
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:42,720
outdoorsy people created outdoorsy people.

318
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:46,100
When climbing a mountain, for example, there's a lot of information worth knowing beyond

319
00:20:46,100 --> 00:20:47,680
where the trail starts.

320
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:48,680
Has the snow melted?

321
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:50,600
Did the approach road require a high-clearance vehicle?

322
00:20:50,600 --> 00:20:52,200
What's a safe turnaround time?

323
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:53,680
What sort of equipment is warranted?

324
00:20:53,680 --> 00:20:54,680
How does the weather behave?

325
00:20:54,680 --> 00:20:56,240
What sort of experience is needed?

326
00:20:56,720 --> 00:21:01,280
In the past, this information flowed through old-school, person-to-person social networks—as

327
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:05,320
in, climbers would disseminate information one-on-one to other climbers, which created

328
00:21:05,320 --> 00:21:09,320
an informal vetting system—essentially, more experienced climbers would only give

329
00:21:09,320 --> 00:21:13,200
the information to those that they thought were ready for the climb.

330
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:18,280
Today, all the information and more is available on the internet, allowing anyone of any experience

331
00:21:18,280 --> 00:21:22,140
level the ability to get the information necessary to attempt a climb.

332
00:21:22,140 --> 00:21:27,320
In one way, this is good—it counters the unintentionally exclusionary nature of nature,

333
00:21:27,320 --> 00:21:31,780
allowing those without access to those person-to-person social networks the ability to engage in outdoor

334
00:21:31,780 --> 00:21:38,420
recreation, but it also means that that informal vetting process of the past has broken down.

335
00:21:38,420 --> 00:21:42,880
Information flows freely, even to those that don't have the experience to use it wisely.

336
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:46,900
This is coupled with the increasing availability of communication in the backcountry.

337
00:21:46,900 --> 00:21:51,120
In recent years, relatively low-cost satellite messaging devices have hit the market that

338
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:55,460
allow the injured and lost to call for help regardless of cell service, and now the iPhone

339
00:21:55,460 --> 00:21:57,560
14 includes a similar feature as well.

340
00:21:57,560 --> 00:22:01,620
While this has saved countless lives, it's also viewed as a contributing factor in the

341
00:22:01,620 --> 00:22:06,280
rise of search and rescue calls for those that are simply exhausted or unprepared.

342
00:22:06,280 --> 00:22:10,840
It essentially lowers individual consequences by forcing volunteer search and rescue personnel

343
00:22:10,840 --> 00:22:14,240
into the field in potentially hazardous conditions more often.

344
00:22:14,680 --> 00:22:20,040
In fact, in 2016, a majority of search and rescue calls in national parks were for these

345
00:22:20,040 --> 00:22:21,040
reasons.

346
00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:26,320
Therefore, too low of a barrier to entry is a risk considering the outdoors is an environment

347
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:31,300
where people routinely underestimate risk—where people prepare for the best-case scenario

348
00:22:31,300 --> 00:22:32,840
rather than the worst.

349
00:22:32,840 --> 00:22:37,220
Too high of a barrier to entry is also a risk since it deprives access to those that want

350
00:22:37,220 --> 00:22:41,560
to gain its benefits, and leaves more questioning whether outdoor recreation has value worth

351
00:22:41,560 --> 00:22:43,040
protecting.

352
00:22:43,040 --> 00:22:48,440
This is why these areas require such careful management—the outdoors is a scarce resource

353
00:22:48,440 --> 00:22:51,820
that must be protected in perpetuity.

354
00:22:51,820 --> 00:22:56,120
Even under the most recreation-first mindset, the mission is to allow access to the most

355
00:22:56,120 --> 00:23:01,160
number of people possible, but some of those people have not even been born yet—the outdoors

356
00:23:01,160 --> 00:23:03,800
is considered in a timescale of forever.

357
00:23:03,800 --> 00:23:09,880
It's a game of finding the line of non-consumptive use.

358
00:23:09,880 --> 00:23:14,200
Simply finding that line is near impossible in the best of times, but what makes it ever

359
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:18,920
more difficult is a massive influx of people attempting to push that line.

360
00:23:18,920 --> 00:23:23,700
The outdoors is not an environment compatible with the surges that an information-rich society

361
00:23:23,700 --> 00:23:24,700
cultivates.

362
00:23:24,700 --> 00:23:30,140
It's essentially a situation without a solution—one remedied only by an overworked army of land

363
00:23:30,140 --> 00:23:34,580
managers tasked with the impossible feat of keeping a sum intact while allowing millions

364
00:23:34,580 --> 00:23:38,840
to subtract from it, one step at a time.

365
00:23:38,840 --> 00:23:43,440
One fascinating fact about the outdoors in the US is that there is no nationwide search

366
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:44,960
and rescue system.

367
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:49,080
When you push that SOS button, who comes and saves you is pretty much down to what county

368
00:23:49,080 --> 00:23:50,080
you're in.

369
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:53,400
Sometimes it's just going to be a sheriff's deputy with zero search and rescue training,

370
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:56,720
but more often it's a group of completely volunteer rescuers.

371
00:23:56,720 --> 00:24:01,480
But these rescuers know what they're doing—they're doctors, nurses, and EMTs, highly skilled

372
00:24:01,480 --> 00:24:05,680
trail runners and climbers and kayakers, all individuals who have donated their time to

373
00:24:05,680 --> 00:24:10,080
learn the time-tested techniques behind finding someone, stabilizing their condition, and

374
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:14,040
extracting them from the most remote and dangerous environments on earth.

375
00:24:14,040 --> 00:24:17,680
We wanted to learn more about this, so we made a whole episode of our Nebula original

376
00:24:17,680 --> 00:24:20,720
series Logistics of X about this exact subject.

377
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:25,200
It was really fascinating—we did a deep dive into how some real rescues on Mount Hood

378
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:28,760
worked using stunning 3D graphics and some really phenomenal footage.

379
00:24:28,760 --> 00:24:33,260
I found it so fascinating because there's so much technique and purpose into what might

380
00:24:33,260 --> 00:24:36,420
seem like the straightforward task of just finding someone and getting them out of the

381
00:24:36,420 --> 00:24:37,420
wilderness.

382
00:24:37,420 --> 00:24:41,620
And this is only one episode of the series—the first one was about the logistics of ski resorts,

383
00:24:41,620 --> 00:24:45,540
which is another thing that is way more complicated than it initially seems, and we're already

384
00:24:45,540 --> 00:24:48,340
well into production for future episodes.

385
00:24:48,340 --> 00:24:52,740
And this is only one series out of a whole catalog of others on Nebula made by creators

386
00:24:52,740 --> 00:24:54,900
that you probably already watch and enjoy.

387
00:24:54,900 --> 00:24:59,140
The idea behind Nebula is simple—these are creators that know how to make really good

388
00:24:59,140 --> 00:25:03,020
content on a tight budget that millions of people enjoy, so it only makes sense that

389
00:25:03,020 --> 00:25:06,940
if you give them a little more budget, they can make even better content.

390
00:25:06,940 --> 00:25:10,500
I couldn't possibly go over it all, but some of my favorites are Under Exposure by

391
00:25:10,500 --> 00:25:14,940
Neel, Modern Conflicts by RealLifeLore, and Tip of the Spear by Mustard.

392
00:25:14,940 --> 00:25:18,400
Of course, on top of all the originals, every single one of these creators uploads their

393
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:22,100
videos ad- and sponsorship-free on Nebula, so you have a better viewing experience for

394
00:25:22,100 --> 00:25:26,620
normal content, exclusive additional content, and all of this is made possible by a business

395
00:25:26,620 --> 00:25:30,060
model that is more sustainable for creators themselves.

396
00:25:30,100 --> 00:25:34,540
Over 50,000 Wendover viewers have signed up to date, and the majority are still subscribed,

397
00:25:34,540 --> 00:25:38,300
meaning they clearly liked it, so if you want to watch the logistics of X, get the best

398
00:25:38,300 --> 00:25:42,260
viewing experience of our videos, and help support the channel, head to nebula.tv slash

399
00:25:42,260 --> 00:25:46,200
Wendover to sign up, and you'll even get $20 off an annual subscription there, which

400
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:49,980
brings the monthly cost down to just $2.50.
