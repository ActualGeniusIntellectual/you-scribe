0	4860	Here's a lie—American outdoor recreation is doing better than ever.
4860	7660	And here are some statistics to back up that lie.
7660	12320	These are annual National Park Service visitor figures in the US since 2000—the numbers
12320	15300	going up and to the right, the good way.
15300	19020	More Americans than ever are visiting national park sites.
19020	23860	Take the NPS's historic and recreation sites out of this data, and just focus on the 63
23860	28140	nature-focused national parks and the trends even stronger—the number of visitors is
28140	31820	going up and up and up.
31820	34600	Along with attendance, spending is rising too.
34600	39580	With $20.5 billion spent in the parks and gateway communities surrounding them, 2021
39580	44300	saw a return to the all-time highs that defined the late 2010s.
44300	47820	Jobs in the parks and jobs created by the parks also bounced back from COVID-stricken
47820	51040	2020 and returned to near-record numbers too.
51040	55460	In visitors, spending, and employment, the National Park Service—the single institution
55460	60240	that most clearly embodies the alignment of Americans and nature—has never looked
60240	62080	so strong.
62080	66920	Furthering the lie, the trend of Americans pouring outdoors is bigger than the parks.
66920	71480	2021 was a massive year for the American outdoor industry as a whole.
71480	78660	It generated $862 billion, it accounted for 1.9% of America's GDP, it employed 3% of
78660	83080	working Americans, and the sector's growth rate tripled the pace of the rest of the American
83080	84280	economy.
84340	88340	Whether it's in national parks, state parks, city parks, forest service land, Bureau of
88340	92980	Land Management land, or not land at all but rivers and shorelines, Americans are visiting
92980	98660	the outdoors, spending money on the outdoors, and working in the outdoors more than ever.
98660	102060	The problem is, it's crushing the outdoors.
102060	105980	Here's the bit of nuance that these numbers miss.
105980	110380	The people going into nature in such massive numbers are increasingly aggregating in an
110380	112820	incredibly limited number of sites.
113400	118240	In fact, flip how you interpret those national park numbers, and they point to a real problem—more
118240	123000	and more, everyone is going to the same place.
123000	126860	Perhaps then it's not a great celebration of the American outdoors that Yellowstone
126860	131800	nearly hit 5 million visitors in 2021, or that Great Smoky surpassed 14 million, or
131800	136320	that four of Utah's heavily-marketed Mighty Five National Parks—Arches, Canyonlands,
136320	141080	Capitol Reef, and Zion—all hit visitation records in 2021.
141080	145140	Perhaps it's a tragic lack of creativity that in a country with more than a quarter
145140	150220	of its area designated as public lands, hundreds of millions are flowing into the exact same
150220	152580	handful of places.
152580	157500	Just down Highway 191 from the turnoffs of two of Utah's most celebrated natural areas,
157500	161800	Canyonlands and Arches, is the 5,000-person town of Moab.
161800	165740	Four hours from Salt Lake, more than five from Denver, and six-plus from Albuquerque,
165740	169420	Phoenix, and Las Vegas, Moab is far from anywhere.
169640	175240	Yet, this tiny town, and its world-class climbing, its year-round camping, its endless slick-rock
175240	179440	bike trails and off-roading routes, along with its awe-inspiring parks, pull some three
179440	183280	to five million visitors a year from the world over.
183280	186720	And while business has broadly been good in the past two decades as the outdoor industry
186720	191940	has taken off, the always-rising numbers are now pushing the town to the brink.
191940	194880	The unexpected consequences start with the parks.
194880	199220	A decade ago, Utah launched an international marketing blitz to show the world it was more
199220	202080	than brown dirt and salt lakes.
202080	206320	The ads, billboards, and commercials that spread around the world worked, and Moab,
206320	211060	in turn, became the gateway to southern Utah's natural beauty—the town where you'd base
211060	215000	your visit out of, where you'd have breakfast before going into the parks, grab snacks for
215000	218360	your planned hikes, and eat dinner after a long day out.
218360	223120	It felt like a win-win-win—more dollars spent in the state, further economic growth
223120	227320	for the former uranium town, and more visitors exploring the outdoors.
227320	230460	But then-visitor numbers just kept growing.
230460	235020	Recently, Arches has been doing something it nearly never did—it's been closing
235020	237860	its gates, on account of crowding.
237860	243340	This has happened before only on the busiest of holidays, but in 2020, it became the norm.
243340	247940	In September of that year, the park told visitors at the gate to come back later on 16 separate
247940	248940	days.
248940	252620	It was a record for closures in a month, but a record that didn't stand long as the park
252620	256900	then closed its gates every day for the first 17 days of October.
256900	261520	Arches, a park of nearly 80,000 acres, was simply overflowing.
261520	266080	In the surge's wake, the park has experimented with advanced ticketing during peak season,
266080	270120	and has worked to communicate the benefits of showing up either early or late.
270120	275240	But the park doesn't have any easy answers—it's expanded the infrastructure where it can,
275240	280320	it's added parking, but it can't build another delicate arch.
280320	282520	Visitors, for their part, have found alternatives.
282520	284320	They've gone over to Canyonlands.
284740	288780	They've gone to Dead Horse State Park, which now itself has reached over a million annual
288780	289780	visitors.
289780	293540	They now are turned back at the gate and search directions for the once-unknown swimming hole
293540	294780	on the edge of town.
294780	298660	They miss out on camping reservations in the park, so the overnight crowd spills into the
298660	303100	Bureau of Land Management campgrounds here, where the Forest Service lands here.
303100	306240	The spillover is causing chaos.
306240	309980	Moab has traffic now, its restaurants are short-staffed, and its employees are getting
309980	314380	squeezed out because long-term rentals are being converted to short-term ones.
314380	318320	For residents, it's too much—they're tired of losing out on housing and listening
318320	322440	all day and night to noisy off-roaders driving through town to their next trailhead.
322440	326960	They've come to a conclusion that would have been unimaginable two decades ago.
326960	331360	They believe the booming outdoor industry that's enveloped their town is now hurting
331360	334440	it and the landscape more than it's helping.
334900	340960	In a 2022 survey, 59% of Moab-area residents polled said that quality of life had declined
340960	344420	on account of tourism, while more than half of respondents believed that the negatives
344420	348540	of tourism were now outweighing the positives—and this was a survey group where nearly half
348540	352020	of the respondents said that their income relied on tourism.
352020	355900	It's not just the town that's at its wits' ends either.
355900	359280	National park staff are stretched thin educating first-time visitors on how to move through
359280	362820	parks without damaging the cryptobiotic soil, while also trying to keep up with all the
362820	365640	trash and waste these visitors create.
365640	369840	The task is even taller for Bureau of Land Management staff, who, based out of this single
369840	374640	building are expected to inspect, manage, and look after all this BLM land, and the
374640	378600	Forest Service Rangers based out of this even smaller renovated house who are responsible
378600	383160	for this impossibly large amount of territory that's becoming ever more popular with the
383160	385080	outdoor crowd.
385080	388080	Fundamentally, Moab has changed.
388080	393380	What was once the spot to get off the beaten trail, to explore Red Rock Desert, to meander,
393380	397900	to get away, has become the spot to sit in line.
397900	402700	And yet, people are still sitting in line, in unmatched numbers.
402700	407900	And it's all for this—to watch the sun rise over Delicate Arch, to watch the light
407900	413540	fill up the valley through Mesa Arch, to cool off from the desert heat in Mill Creek.
413540	418060	People wait and wait and elbow their way into position to do these things, and more importantly,
418060	421000	to take pictures of them doing these things.
421000	426160	Today, an increasing number of people are going outside, not to get lost or to explore,
426160	427960	but to be seen.
427960	431880	Tourists jockey for camera position in Arches and Canyonlands to show their Instagram followers
431880	432880	they've been there.
432880	437200	They do the same at Horseshoe Bend, which now charges parking fees at its massive lot
437200	440020	that was just a dirt pull-off 20 years ago.
440020	443640	Not far away, they do the same at Antelope Canyon, waiting their turn to throw sand in
443640	446200	the air and hope the light catches it right.
446200	451180	They sit in endless lines at Zion National Park 2, waiting for hours to climb and document
451180	452820	the climb up Angel's Landing.
452820	457380	In a culture where experience increasingly conveys value, the long waits are worth the
457380	462500	payoff—the picture, the geotag, the proof that you too have been to America's most
462500	464860	iconic viewpoints.
464860	469540	For the national parks, this sudden virality of a few specific spots is a massive headache,
469540	474380	as seemingly overnight, they need more toilets, more parking, more resources expended towards
474380	476660	specific corners of their parks.
476660	480760	For areas more remote and more difficult to access, like Idaho's Kirkham Hot Springs,
480760	484960	Oregon's Opal Creek, or Colorado's Conundrum Hot Springs, the job of managing these viral
484960	488840	areas—keeping them litter-free and providing proper parking and bathroom facilities at
488840	493120	the trailhead so the landscapes don't get ruined—is becoming nearly impossible as
493120	497320	visitor numbers rise and location names spread like wildfire online.
497320	502260	How, for instance, can a Forest Service employee possibly keep an eye on Conundrum Hot Springs
502260	507760	when it's a 9-mile or 14-kilometer hike climbing 3,000 feet or 900 meters of gain
507760	510800	just to get to the springs in the first place?
510800	515560	The social media craze of documenting experiences in the outdoors has spread beyond Instagram
515560	516560	and Twitter too.
516560	520760	There's Strava, where users can track and map their activities, host them for all to
520760	524640	see, and compete with the rest of the community to see who can bike, hike, and run through
524640	526280	segments of trail the fastest.
526280	530440	There's AllTrails that provides maps and directions, along with user photos and reviews
530440	532500	of practically any hike out there.
532500	536320	There's a similar product for mountain bikers called MTB Project, and a similar product
536320	538420	for trail runners called Trail Run Project.
538420	542700	There's an app for every outdoor pursuit that puts maps and critical information in
542700	546980	a user's pocket, and provides incentive to go out, hit the trail, and size oneself
546980	550500	up against everyone else out there doing the same thing.
550500	554820	Whether competing for times, likes, kudos, or clout, social media has reimagined the
554820	558860	outdoors—it's made the busy spots busier, and it's forcing land managers to do what
558860	564800	no land manager wants to do—place restrictions on access.
564800	569080	Each and every time a barrier to outdoor access is implemented, a different version of the
569080	574840	same debate plays out—who's to blame, will it work, is it fair, and is any of that
574840	576840	even met?
576840	579640	This is Maine's Baxter State Park.
579640	583840	Confusingly, it is not, in fact, a Maine State Park.
583840	588840	Rather, it operates as a trust—a legal arrangement that ensures usage of an asset as the trust's
588840	592740	trustee, in this case Governor Percival Proctor Baxter, intended.
592740	593980	He wrote, quote,
593980	595620	Man is born to die.
595620	596780	His works are short-lived.
596780	603740	Buildings crumble, monuments decay, wealth vanishes, but Katahdin, in all its glory,
603740	607260	forever shall remain the mountain of the people of Maine.
607260	614220	Katahdin, the towering 5,269-foot, 1,606-meter peak in the center of the park, stretches
614220	621960	higher than any other mountain in the state, but unfurling 2,198.4 miles or 3,538 kilometers
621960	627400	to its south is the Appalachian Trail—perhaps the most legendary long-distance hiking trail
627400	629000	in the world.
629000	633820	In this context, though, legendary status is not necessarily a good thing.
633820	637380	The number of thru-hikers, those walking the entire length from Springer Mountain, Georgia
637380	641700	to Mount Katahdin, Maine, has steadily grown since the trail's inception, accelerated
641700	645400	in growth through the 21st century as word of the trek spread through forums, videos,
645400	650000	and social media, then accelerated once again in 2015 with the release of the movie A Walk
650000	654080	in the Woods, an adaptation of Bill Bryson's book about his AT thru-hike.
654080	658620	Now, the Appalachian Trail has never been a lightly-used trail.
658620	662440	It snakes its way through the most densely populated region of America, starting just
662440	667280	75 minutes from Atlanta, passing an hour away from DC, even boasting a direct train connection
667280	668280	to NYC.
668780	673240	Therefore, across the trail, the couple thousand annual thru-hikers have always been vastly
673240	678900	outnumbered by hordes of day and section hikers—with one major exception.
678900	682940	Maine is the least densely populated state on the East Coast, and in the final weeks
682940	688380	and days of their trips, thru-hikers start to pass through true wilderness—no towns,
688380	691300	no cell service, hardly even road crossings.
691300	695260	In fact, the last paved road they'll cross is the first one they'll have seen in a
695260	700160	week and sits right on the border of Baxter State Park—by far the strictest one on the
700160	702640	entire trail stretch.
702640	708600	After months crossing heavily-used and loosely-regulated land, Baxter is an anomaly.
708600	713640	Inside, infrastructure is limited—no electricity, no running water, no paved roads—and the
713640	715360	rules are endless.
715360	720500	No pets, no motorcycles, no outside firewood, no soap, no groups of more than 12, no vehicles
720500	724820	longer than 22 feet, no children under 6 above the treeline—it's about as close to true
724880	728640	wilderness one can get in a managed park, and the park's authority works hard to keep
728640	729880	it that way.
729880	734460	Therefore, Baxter strictly regulates visitor numbers, requiring elusive reservations for
734460	740160	parking at most trailheads and sleeping in all campgrounds, with one notable exception.
740160	744500	Reflecting the unpredictability of their arrival date, the park long allowed some Appalachian
744500	749700	trail thru-hikers to enter unrestricted, granting the first 12 each day the right to pay $10
749700	754460	to camp at the base of Mount Katahdin before the final miles of their months-long treks.
754460	758260	After all, across all those months leading up to this moment, no matter which park the
758260	762460	AT passed through, not a single trailside campground would have required reservations,
762460	767380	meaning while this was an exception to Baxter's system, it was the norm for the ATs.
767380	772580	In fact, this very norm—the boundless, uninhibited ability to simply point north, walk as far
772580	778180	as possible, sleep, then do it again—was considered central to the allure of the trail.
778180	783100	But, according to Baxter State Park, that allure, or at least the knowledge of that
783100	785780	allure, had grown too strong.
785780	788620	The public rhetoric escalated.
788620	793540	Baxter alleged that, among myriad other concerns, AT hikers most flagrantly violated the park's
793540	795700	group size limits and alcohol ban.
795700	800200	After months on the same trail, hikers typically operated as one big nomadic social circle
800200	804500	by the finish, leading many to want to finish together and celebrate at Katahdin's summit,
804500	808380	leading to a party-like atmosphere that the park authority considered incompatible with
808380	810700	its conservation-first goals.
810740	815460	Ultimately, the straw that broke the camel's back appeared to be the incident in 2015,
815460	819680	when legendary ultra-marathoner Scott Jurek completed a monumental feat.
819680	824800	He had run the length of the trail in just 46 days—a new record that broke down to
824800	827900	nearly two marathons' distance per day.
827900	831500	Given the scale of the feat, a horde of media followed him to the summit, where he celebrated
831500	834020	his achievement by spraying and drinking champagne.
834020	839620	In acknowledgement of this, the park rewarded him with three legal summits—one for alcohol
839620	843240	consumption, against the park's rules, one for littering, for the champagne that
843240	847460	had been spilled, and one for a group size violation—since the media that followed
847460	850380	totaled above the park's cap of 12.
850380	854960	Inevitably, furious debate followed on whether some spilled champagne constituted littering,
854960	858740	whether media following a soon-to-be record holder constituted a true group that Jurek
858740	863020	was responsible for, and most of all on whether it was even right to cite the man for a short
863020	865580	celebration of an all-time record.
865580	869620	Jurek, on principle, took this to court where the group size and littering citations were
869620	873460	dismissed, but this only escalated the larger conversation.
873460	878420	Was the Appalachian Trail even compatible with Baxter's legally enshrined conservation-focused
878420	882360	mission, and were Baxter's strict rules even justified by their conservation mission
882360	884100	in the first place?
884100	887180	The Baxter State Park Authority clearly wasn't waiting for an answer, though.
887180	891860	They abruptly announced that, after nearly a century of limitless access along the entire
891860	897380	stretch of the trail, Appalachian Trail thru-hikers would now be capped.
897380	904780	As of 2017, only 3,150 would be allowed to complete their trek atop Mount Katahdin.
904780	909020	Inevitably, this sparked uproar in the AT community.
909020	913120	Hikers were near paranoid over the prospect of walking over 2,000 miles from Georgia and
913120	915860	getting turned away in the final 15.
915860	919620	They argued that the couple thousand annual thru-hikers couldn't possibly have a notable
919620	923620	impact compared to the tens of thousands of car-based visitors each summer.
923620	928280	They argued that, despite their legal right, Baxter State Park was simply just wrong to
928280	931800	throw a near century of precedent out the window.
931800	934180	The park came back with a simple argument.
934180	938300	Percival Baxter very clearly indicated in his trust documents that the park's primary
938300	942620	purpose was conservation, yet left no instructions as to the Appalachian Trail.
942620	947580	Therefore, both in practice and in law, conservation came first.
947580	953300	Ultimately, there was nothing AT hikers or the Appalachian Trail Conservancy could do.
953300	957660	Some complained, others sympathized with Baxter's position, understanding that the park had
957660	962440	a different mission than the trail, and, as their host, Baxter had every right to implement
962440	965420	any rule or restriction they wanted.
965420	970100	The showdown in Baxter was, in many ways, an accentuated microcosm of the debates happening
970100	972100	more widely in the outdoors.
972100	976440	It's a unique case in which one of the most heavily trafficked trails in the world, hosting
976440	980560	at least 3 million people on a portion each year, interacts with one of the most strictly
980560	986220	regulated parks in the world, made possible uniquely by its independent funding and management.
986220	990080	Not all the debates happen in such stark terms, where the ultimate threat throughout has been
990080	995200	the expulsion of the trail from the park, but it is the same debate—what sort of access
995200	997320	should humans have to nature?
997320	999400	How much is too much?
999400	1003560	There's essentially zero unmanaged nature left on earth.
1003560	1008400	With limited exception, there just isn't empty public land operating without any regulatory
1008400	1009400	body.
1009400	1013280	Each and every one of these regulatory bodies picks somewhere between no access, pristine
1013280	1017720	wilderness restricting all human access, which itself is not even the natural state, and
1017720	1022940	unlimited access—another near impossible construct since infrastructure naturally caps
1022940	1024600	access.
1024600	1026680	There appears no perfect answer.
1026680	1031400	You see, eliminating human access to nature has consequences.
1031400	1035820	There is a seemingly endless body of academic research linking exposure to nature with positive
1035820	1040240	effects on mental health, and it all seems to loosely link back to the biophilia theory—the
1040240	1044320	idea that humans have some innate affinity to proximity to nature.
1044320	1049640	There is an evolutionary explanation for this—after all, our ancestors were more likely to survive
1049640	1053320	in resource-rich environments with lots of other forms of life.
1053320	1056960	But perhaps stronger evidence is found in today's world where the average human lives
1056960	1060760	in an urban area cut off from easy access to nature.
1060760	1063620	Why do people spend time and money to raise pets?
1063620	1069200	Why do people prefer live houseplains to less expensive artificial versions, even when indistinguishable?
1069200	1073460	Why do people drive for hours to walk in the woods when they could just walk down the sidewalk?
1073460	1077560	The questions about nature's curious draw could go on and on, but on the flip side,
1077560	1081200	there are studies linking time and nature to higher levels of creativity, lower levels
1081200	1086480	of stress, improved mood, and above all, higher self-reported personal well-being.
1086480	1090640	And then, beyond the personal, nature-connectedness is linked to higher concern for nature's
1090640	1094240	well-being, which, in a world threatened by the continual destruction of wilderness,
1094240	1098320	at least theoretically implies humans with better access to nature will do more to save
1098320	1099680	it.
1099680	1102580	But unlimited access has its issues too.
1102580	1107420	To start, many of those psychological benefits are linked to isolation—linked to the downstream
1107420	1110600	effects of self-sufficiency in a wild space.
1110600	1114800	Hiking angels landing with back-to-back traffic is absolutely a different experience with
1114800	1117320	a lesser benefit than hiking it alone.
1117520	1122320	Therefore, while impossible to quantify, there is absolutely a point where the marginal benefit
1122320	1126400	that one additional person gains from being allowed on the trail is outweighed by the
1126400	1131800	sum of the marginal detriment everyone else encounters due to a busier trail.
1131800	1134400	But then there are the more practical concerns.
1134400	1137800	Nature can be a dangerous environment where risks need to be properly mitigated, but the
1137800	1142180	rise of the outdoors as a lifestyle trait or social media backdrop has perhaps masked
1142180	1143180	this truth.
1143180	1147000	Baxter State Park, for example, justifies much of its heavy-handedness with its need
1147000	1148520	to keep visitors safe.
1148520	1153220	Katahdin is a well-known, yet high-risk mountain in a region of America with relatively tamer
1153220	1154220	nature.
1154220	1158460	A hiker from Boston, for example, is likely not accustomed to the level of isolation or
1158460	1162040	exposure that Katahdin presents, because there just aren't that many mountains with the
1162040	1164620	same risk factor in the region.
1164620	1168400	The reservations-only system means no one can make the spontaneous decision to hike
1168400	1172540	Baxter without planning—they'll spend days or weeks researching before even getting
1172540	1174480	to parking reservations.
1174640	1179280	Upon arrival, Baxter Rangers are trained to essentially triage hikers at Katahdin trailheads,
1179280	1183520	checking whether they have adequate footwear, clothing, supplies, and asking questions that,
1183520	1187540	according to the park's director, are designed to subtly spook them—get them in the mindset
1187540	1191840	that what they're about to do has risk and isn't just a walk in the park.
1191840	1196460	Then, as a final filter, this foreboding sign is placed a half-mile up the trail to be read
1196460	1200200	once the initial excitement of the day has worn off, and a more rational brain perhaps
1200200	1201760	takes over.
1201760	1206680	Despite these precautions, roughly one in every 2,000 Baxter visitors requires medical
1206680	1211100	or search and rescue resources, far above the nationwide average, and more than 60 people
1211100	1214440	have died while climbing Maine's tallest peak.
1214440	1219120	Now, the question of how high the barrier to entry should be is a tricky one, as the
1219120	1224760	outdoors is a domain dominated by a core demographic—it's primarily used by people who are wealthier,
1224760	1226440	white, and male.
1226440	1230120	This is something that the outdoor recreation industry especially is working to counter,
1230120	1233600	since it makes it tougher to generate political support and limits their potential customer
1233600	1234600	base.
1234600	1239880	But it's no wonder why the outdoors has unintentionally been exclusionary—essentially,
1239880	1242720	outdoorsy people created outdoorsy people.
1242720	1246100	When climbing a mountain, for example, there's a lot of information worth knowing beyond
1246100	1247680	where the trail starts.
1247680	1248680	Has the snow melted?
1248680	1250600	Did the approach road require a high-clearance vehicle?
1250600	1252200	What's a safe turnaround time?
1252200	1253680	What sort of equipment is warranted?
1253680	1254680	How does the weather behave?
1254680	1256240	What sort of experience is needed?
1256720	1261280	In the past, this information flowed through old-school, person-to-person social networks—as
1261280	1265320	in, climbers would disseminate information one-on-one to other climbers, which created
1265320	1269320	an informal vetting system—essentially, more experienced climbers would only give
1269320	1273200	the information to those that they thought were ready for the climb.
1273200	1278280	Today, all the information and more is available on the internet, allowing anyone of any experience
1278280	1282140	level the ability to get the information necessary to attempt a climb.
1282140	1287320	In one way, this is good—it counters the unintentionally exclusionary nature of nature,
1287320	1291780	allowing those without access to those person-to-person social networks the ability to engage in outdoor
1291780	1298420	recreation, but it also means that that informal vetting process of the past has broken down.
1298420	1302880	Information flows freely, even to those that don't have the experience to use it wisely.
1302880	1306900	This is coupled with the increasing availability of communication in the backcountry.
1306900	1311120	In recent years, relatively low-cost satellite messaging devices have hit the market that
1311120	1315460	allow the injured and lost to call for help regardless of cell service, and now the iPhone
1315460	1317560	14 includes a similar feature as well.
1317560	1321620	While this has saved countless lives, it's also viewed as a contributing factor in the
1321620	1326280	rise of search and rescue calls for those that are simply exhausted or unprepared.
1326280	1330840	It essentially lowers individual consequences by forcing volunteer search and rescue personnel
1330840	1334240	into the field in potentially hazardous conditions more often.
1334680	1340040	In fact, in 2016, a majority of search and rescue calls in national parks were for these
1340040	1341040	reasons.
1341040	1346320	Therefore, too low of a barrier to entry is a risk considering the outdoors is an environment
1346320	1351300	where people routinely underestimate risk—where people prepare for the best-case scenario
1351300	1352840	rather than the worst.
1352840	1357220	Too high of a barrier to entry is also a risk since it deprives access to those that want
1357220	1361560	to gain its benefits, and leaves more questioning whether outdoor recreation has value worth
1361560	1363040	protecting.
1363040	1368440	This is why these areas require such careful management—the outdoors is a scarce resource
1368440	1371820	that must be protected in perpetuity.
1371820	1376120	Even under the most recreation-first mindset, the mission is to allow access to the most
1376120	1381160	number of people possible, but some of those people have not even been born yet—the outdoors
1381160	1383800	is considered in a timescale of forever.
1383800	1389880	It's a game of finding the line of non-consumptive use.
1389880	1394200	Simply finding that line is near impossible in the best of times, but what makes it ever
1394200	1398920	more difficult is a massive influx of people attempting to push that line.
1398920	1403700	The outdoors is not an environment compatible with the surges that an information-rich society
1403700	1404700	cultivates.
1404700	1410140	It's essentially a situation without a solution—one remedied only by an overworked army of land
1410140	1414580	managers tasked with the impossible feat of keeping a sum intact while allowing millions
1414580	1418840	to subtract from it, one step at a time.
1418840	1423440	One fascinating fact about the outdoors in the US is that there is no nationwide search
1423440	1424960	and rescue system.
1424960	1429080	When you push that SOS button, who comes and saves you is pretty much down to what county
1429080	1430080	you're in.
1430080	1433400	Sometimes it's just going to be a sheriff's deputy with zero search and rescue training,
1433400	1436720	but more often it's a group of completely volunteer rescuers.
1436720	1441480	But these rescuers know what they're doing—they're doctors, nurses, and EMTs, highly skilled
1441480	1445680	trail runners and climbers and kayakers, all individuals who have donated their time to
1445680	1450080	learn the time-tested techniques behind finding someone, stabilizing their condition, and
1450080	1454040	extracting them from the most remote and dangerous environments on earth.
1454040	1457680	We wanted to learn more about this, so we made a whole episode of our Nebula original
1457680	1460720	series Logistics of X about this exact subject.
1460720	1465200	It was really fascinating—we did a deep dive into how some real rescues on Mount Hood
1465200	1468760	worked using stunning 3D graphics and some really phenomenal footage.
1468760	1473260	I found it so fascinating because there's so much technique and purpose into what might
1473260	1476420	seem like the straightforward task of just finding someone and getting them out of the
1476420	1477420	wilderness.
1477420	1481620	And this is only one episode of the series—the first one was about the logistics of ski resorts,
1481620	1485540	which is another thing that is way more complicated than it initially seems, and we're already
1485540	1488340	well into production for future episodes.
1488340	1492740	And this is only one series out of a whole catalog of others on Nebula made by creators
1492740	1494900	that you probably already watch and enjoy.
1494900	1499140	The idea behind Nebula is simple—these are creators that know how to make really good
1499140	1503020	content on a tight budget that millions of people enjoy, so it only makes sense that
1503020	1506940	if you give them a little more budget, they can make even better content.
1506940	1510500	I couldn't possibly go over it all, but some of my favorites are Under Exposure by
1510500	1514940	Neel, Modern Conflicts by RealLifeLore, and Tip of the Spear by Mustard.
1514940	1518400	Of course, on top of all the originals, every single one of these creators uploads their
1518400	1522100	videos ad- and sponsorship-free on Nebula, so you have a better viewing experience for
1522100	1526620	normal content, exclusive additional content, and all of this is made possible by a business
1526620	1530060	model that is more sustainable for creators themselves.
1530100	1534540	Over 50,000 Wendover viewers have signed up to date, and the majority are still subscribed,
1534540	1538300	meaning they clearly liked it, so if you want to watch the logistics of X, get the best
1538300	1542260	viewing experience of our videos, and help support the channel, head to nebula.tv slash
1542260	1546200	Wendover to sign up, and you'll even get $20 off an annual subscription there, which
1546200	1549980	brings the monthly cost down to just $2.50.
