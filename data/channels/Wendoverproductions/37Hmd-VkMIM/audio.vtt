00:00.000 --> 00:04.860
Here's a lie—American outdoor recreation is doing better than ever.

00:04.860 --> 00:07.660
And here are some statistics to back up that lie.

00:07.660 --> 00:12.320
These are annual National Park Service visitor figures in the US since 2000—the numbers

00:12.320 --> 00:15.300
going up and to the right, the good way.

00:15.300 --> 00:19.020
More Americans than ever are visiting national park sites.

00:19.020 --> 00:23.860
Take the NPS's historic and recreation sites out of this data, and just focus on the 63

00:23.860 --> 00:28.140
nature-focused national parks and the trends even stronger—the number of visitors is

00:28.140 --> 00:31.820
going up and up and up.

00:31.820 --> 00:34.600
Along with attendance, spending is rising too.

00:34.600 --> 00:39.580
With $20.5 billion spent in the parks and gateway communities surrounding them, 2021

00:39.580 --> 00:44.300
saw a return to the all-time highs that defined the late 2010s.

00:44.300 --> 00:47.820
Jobs in the parks and jobs created by the parks also bounced back from COVID-stricken

00:47.820 --> 00:51.040
2020 and returned to near-record numbers too.

00:51.040 --> 00:55.460
In visitors, spending, and employment, the National Park Service—the single institution

00:55.460 --> 01:00.240
that most clearly embodies the alignment of Americans and nature—has never looked

01:00.240 --> 01:02.080
so strong.

01:02.080 --> 01:06.920
Furthering the lie, the trend of Americans pouring outdoors is bigger than the parks.

01:06.920 --> 01:11.480
2021 was a massive year for the American outdoor industry as a whole.

01:11.480 --> 01:18.660
It generated $862 billion, it accounted for 1.9% of America's GDP, it employed 3% of

01:18.660 --> 01:23.080
working Americans, and the sector's growth rate tripled the pace of the rest of the American

01:23.080 --> 01:24.280
economy.

01:24.340 --> 01:28.340
Whether it's in national parks, state parks, city parks, forest service land, Bureau of

01:28.340 --> 01:32.980
Land Management land, or not land at all but rivers and shorelines, Americans are visiting

01:32.980 --> 01:38.660
the outdoors, spending money on the outdoors, and working in the outdoors more than ever.

01:38.660 --> 01:42.060
The problem is, it's crushing the outdoors.

01:42.060 --> 01:45.980
Here's the bit of nuance that these numbers miss.

01:45.980 --> 01:50.380
The people going into nature in such massive numbers are increasingly aggregating in an

01:50.380 --> 01:52.820
incredibly limited number of sites.

01:53.400 --> 01:58.240
In fact, flip how you interpret those national park numbers, and they point to a real problem—more

01:58.240 --> 02:03.000
and more, everyone is going to the same place.

02:03.000 --> 02:06.860
Perhaps then it's not a great celebration of the American outdoors that Yellowstone

02:06.860 --> 02:11.800
nearly hit 5 million visitors in 2021, or that Great Smoky surpassed 14 million, or

02:11.800 --> 02:16.320
that four of Utah's heavily-marketed Mighty Five National Parks—Arches, Canyonlands,

02:16.320 --> 02:21.080
Capitol Reef, and Zion—all hit visitation records in 2021.

02:21.080 --> 02:25.140
Perhaps it's a tragic lack of creativity that in a country with more than a quarter

02:25.140 --> 02:30.220
of its area designated as public lands, hundreds of millions are flowing into the exact same

02:30.220 --> 02:32.580
handful of places.

02:32.580 --> 02:37.500
Just down Highway 191 from the turnoffs of two of Utah's most celebrated natural areas,

02:37.500 --> 02:41.800
Canyonlands and Arches, is the 5,000-person town of Moab.

02:41.800 --> 02:45.740
Four hours from Salt Lake, more than five from Denver, and six-plus from Albuquerque,

02:45.740 --> 02:49.420
Phoenix, and Las Vegas, Moab is far from anywhere.

02:49.640 --> 02:55.240
Yet, this tiny town, and its world-class climbing, its year-round camping, its endless slick-rock

02:55.240 --> 02:59.440
bike trails and off-roading routes, along with its awe-inspiring parks, pull some three

02:59.440 --> 03:03.280
to five million visitors a year from the world over.

03:03.280 --> 03:06.720
And while business has broadly been good in the past two decades as the outdoor industry

03:06.720 --> 03:11.940
has taken off, the always-rising numbers are now pushing the town to the brink.

03:11.940 --> 03:14.880
The unexpected consequences start with the parks.

03:14.880 --> 03:19.220
A decade ago, Utah launched an international marketing blitz to show the world it was more

03:19.220 --> 03:22.080
than brown dirt and salt lakes.

03:22.080 --> 03:26.320
The ads, billboards, and commercials that spread around the world worked, and Moab,

03:26.320 --> 03:31.060
in turn, became the gateway to southern Utah's natural beauty—the town where you'd base

03:31.060 --> 03:35.000
your visit out of, where you'd have breakfast before going into the parks, grab snacks for

03:35.000 --> 03:38.360
your planned hikes, and eat dinner after a long day out.

03:38.360 --> 03:43.120
It felt like a win-win-win—more dollars spent in the state, further economic growth

03:43.120 --> 03:47.320
for the former uranium town, and more visitors exploring the outdoors.

03:47.320 --> 03:50.460
But then-visitor numbers just kept growing.

03:50.460 --> 03:55.020
Recently, Arches has been doing something it nearly never did—it's been closing

03:55.020 --> 03:57.860
its gates, on account of crowding.

03:57.860 --> 04:03.340
This has happened before only on the busiest of holidays, but in 2020, it became the norm.

04:03.340 --> 04:07.940
In September of that year, the park told visitors at the gate to come back later on 16 separate

04:07.940 --> 04:08.940
days.

04:08.940 --> 04:12.620
It was a record for closures in a month, but a record that didn't stand long as the park

04:12.620 --> 04:16.900
then closed its gates every day for the first 17 days of October.

04:16.900 --> 04:21.520
Arches, a park of nearly 80,000 acres, was simply overflowing.

04:21.520 --> 04:26.080
In the surge's wake, the park has experimented with advanced ticketing during peak season,

04:26.080 --> 04:30.120
and has worked to communicate the benefits of showing up either early or late.

04:30.120 --> 04:35.240
But the park doesn't have any easy answers—it's expanded the infrastructure where it can,

04:35.240 --> 04:40.320
it's added parking, but it can't build another delicate arch.

04:40.320 --> 04:42.520
Visitors, for their part, have found alternatives.

04:42.520 --> 04:44.320
They've gone over to Canyonlands.

04:44.740 --> 04:48.780
They've gone to Dead Horse State Park, which now itself has reached over a million annual

04:48.780 --> 04:49.780
visitors.

04:49.780 --> 04:53.540
They now are turned back at the gate and search directions for the once-unknown swimming hole

04:53.540 --> 04:54.780
on the edge of town.

04:54.780 --> 04:58.660
They miss out on camping reservations in the park, so the overnight crowd spills into the

04:58.660 --> 05:03.100
Bureau of Land Management campgrounds here, where the Forest Service lands here.

05:03.100 --> 05:06.240
The spillover is causing chaos.

05:06.240 --> 05:09.980
Moab has traffic now, its restaurants are short-staffed, and its employees are getting

05:09.980 --> 05:14.380
squeezed out because long-term rentals are being converted to short-term ones.

05:14.380 --> 05:18.320
For residents, it's too much—they're tired of losing out on housing and listening

05:18.320 --> 05:22.440
all day and night to noisy off-roaders driving through town to their next trailhead.

05:22.440 --> 05:26.960
They've come to a conclusion that would have been unimaginable two decades ago.

05:26.960 --> 05:31.360
They believe the booming outdoor industry that's enveloped their town is now hurting

05:31.360 --> 05:34.440
it and the landscape more than it's helping.

05:34.900 --> 05:40.960
In a 2022 survey, 59% of Moab-area residents polled said that quality of life had declined

05:40.960 --> 05:44.420
on account of tourism, while more than half of respondents believed that the negatives

05:44.420 --> 05:48.540
of tourism were now outweighing the positives—and this was a survey group where nearly half

05:48.540 --> 05:52.020
of the respondents said that their income relied on tourism.

05:52.020 --> 05:55.900
It's not just the town that's at its wits' ends either.

05:55.900 --> 05:59.280
National park staff are stretched thin educating first-time visitors on how to move through

05:59.280 --> 06:02.820
parks without damaging the cryptobiotic soil, while also trying to keep up with all the

06:02.820 --> 06:05.640
trash and waste these visitors create.

06:05.640 --> 06:09.840
The task is even taller for Bureau of Land Management staff, who, based out of this single

06:09.840 --> 06:14.640
building are expected to inspect, manage, and look after all this BLM land, and the

06:14.640 --> 06:18.600
Forest Service Rangers based out of this even smaller renovated house who are responsible

06:18.600 --> 06:23.160
for this impossibly large amount of territory that's becoming ever more popular with the

06:23.160 --> 06:25.080
outdoor crowd.

06:25.080 --> 06:28.080
Fundamentally, Moab has changed.

06:28.080 --> 06:33.380
What was once the spot to get off the beaten trail, to explore Red Rock Desert, to meander,

06:33.380 --> 06:37.900
to get away, has become the spot to sit in line.

06:37.900 --> 06:42.700
And yet, people are still sitting in line, in unmatched numbers.

06:42.700 --> 06:47.900
And it's all for this—to watch the sun rise over Delicate Arch, to watch the light

06:47.900 --> 06:53.540
fill up the valley through Mesa Arch, to cool off from the desert heat in Mill Creek.

06:53.540 --> 06:58.060
People wait and wait and elbow their way into position to do these things, and more importantly,

06:58.060 --> 07:01.000
to take pictures of them doing these things.

07:01.000 --> 07:06.160
Today, an increasing number of people are going outside, not to get lost or to explore,

07:06.160 --> 07:07.960
but to be seen.

07:07.960 --> 07:11.880
Tourists jockey for camera position in Arches and Canyonlands to show their Instagram followers

07:11.880 --> 07:12.880
they've been there.

07:12.880 --> 07:17.200
They do the same at Horseshoe Bend, which now charges parking fees at its massive lot

07:17.200 --> 07:20.020
that was just a dirt pull-off 20 years ago.

07:20.020 --> 07:23.640
Not far away, they do the same at Antelope Canyon, waiting their turn to throw sand in

07:23.640 --> 07:26.200
the air and hope the light catches it right.

07:26.200 --> 07:31.180
They sit in endless lines at Zion National Park 2, waiting for hours to climb and document

07:31.180 --> 07:32.820
the climb up Angel's Landing.

07:32.820 --> 07:37.380
In a culture where experience increasingly conveys value, the long waits are worth the

07:37.380 --> 07:42.500
payoff—the picture, the geotag, the proof that you too have been to America's most

07:42.500 --> 07:44.860
iconic viewpoints.

07:44.860 --> 07:49.540
For the national parks, this sudden virality of a few specific spots is a massive headache,

07:49.540 --> 07:54.380
as seemingly overnight, they need more toilets, more parking, more resources expended towards

07:54.380 --> 07:56.660
specific corners of their parks.

07:56.660 --> 08:00.760
For areas more remote and more difficult to access, like Idaho's Kirkham Hot Springs,

08:00.760 --> 08:04.960
Oregon's Opal Creek, or Colorado's Conundrum Hot Springs, the job of managing these viral

08:04.960 --> 08:08.840
areas—keeping them litter-free and providing proper parking and bathroom facilities at

08:08.840 --> 08:13.120
the trailhead so the landscapes don't get ruined—is becoming nearly impossible as

08:13.120 --> 08:17.320
visitor numbers rise and location names spread like wildfire online.

08:17.320 --> 08:22.260
How, for instance, can a Forest Service employee possibly keep an eye on Conundrum Hot Springs

08:22.260 --> 08:27.760
when it's a 9-mile or 14-kilometer hike climbing 3,000 feet or 900 meters of gain

08:27.760 --> 08:30.800
just to get to the springs in the first place?

08:30.800 --> 08:35.560
The social media craze of documenting experiences in the outdoors has spread beyond Instagram

08:35.560 --> 08:36.560
and Twitter too.

08:36.560 --> 08:40.760
There's Strava, where users can track and map their activities, host them for all to

08:40.760 --> 08:44.640
see, and compete with the rest of the community to see who can bike, hike, and run through

08:44.640 --> 08:46.280
segments of trail the fastest.

08:46.280 --> 08:50.440
There's AllTrails that provides maps and directions, along with user photos and reviews

08:50.440 --> 08:52.500
of practically any hike out there.

08:52.500 --> 08:56.320
There's a similar product for mountain bikers called MTB Project, and a similar product

08:56.320 --> 08:58.420
for trail runners called Trail Run Project.

08:58.420 --> 09:02.700
There's an app for every outdoor pursuit that puts maps and critical information in

09:02.700 --> 09:06.980
a user's pocket, and provides incentive to go out, hit the trail, and size oneself

09:06.980 --> 09:10.500
up against everyone else out there doing the same thing.

09:10.500 --> 09:14.820
Whether competing for times, likes, kudos, or clout, social media has reimagined the

09:14.820 --> 09:18.860
outdoors—it's made the busy spots busier, and it's forcing land managers to do what

09:18.860 --> 09:24.800
no land manager wants to do—place restrictions on access.

09:24.800 --> 09:29.080
Each and every time a barrier to outdoor access is implemented, a different version of the

09:29.080 --> 09:34.840
same debate plays out—who's to blame, will it work, is it fair, and is any of that

09:34.840 --> 09:36.840
even met?

09:36.840 --> 09:39.640
This is Maine's Baxter State Park.

09:39.640 --> 09:43.840
Confusingly, it is not, in fact, a Maine State Park.

09:43.840 --> 09:48.840
Rather, it operates as a trust—a legal arrangement that ensures usage of an asset as the trust's

09:48.840 --> 09:52.740
trustee, in this case Governor Percival Proctor Baxter, intended.

09:52.740 --> 09:53.980
He wrote, quote,

09:53.980 --> 09:55.620
Man is born to die.

09:55.620 --> 09:56.780
His works are short-lived.

09:56.780 --> 10:03.740
Buildings crumble, monuments decay, wealth vanishes, but Katahdin, in all its glory,

10:03.740 --> 10:07.260
forever shall remain the mountain of the people of Maine.

10:07.260 --> 10:14.220
Katahdin, the towering 5,269-foot, 1,606-meter peak in the center of the park, stretches

10:14.220 --> 10:21.960
higher than any other mountain in the state, but unfurling 2,198.4 miles or 3,538 kilometers

10:21.960 --> 10:27.400
to its south is the Appalachian Trail—perhaps the most legendary long-distance hiking trail

10:27.400 --> 10:29.000
in the world.

10:29.000 --> 10:33.820
In this context, though, legendary status is not necessarily a good thing.

10:33.820 --> 10:37.380
The number of thru-hikers, those walking the entire length from Springer Mountain, Georgia

10:37.380 --> 10:41.700
to Mount Katahdin, Maine, has steadily grown since the trail's inception, accelerated

10:41.700 --> 10:45.400
in growth through the 21st century as word of the trek spread through forums, videos,

10:45.400 --> 10:50.000
and social media, then accelerated once again in 2015 with the release of the movie A Walk

10:50.000 --> 10:54.080
in the Woods, an adaptation of Bill Bryson's book about his AT thru-hike.

10:54.080 --> 10:58.620
Now, the Appalachian Trail has never been a lightly-used trail.

10:58.620 --> 11:02.440
It snakes its way through the most densely populated region of America, starting just

11:02.440 --> 11:07.280
75 minutes from Atlanta, passing an hour away from DC, even boasting a direct train connection

11:07.280 --> 11:08.280
to NYC.

11:08.780 --> 11:13.240
Therefore, across the trail, the couple thousand annual thru-hikers have always been vastly

11:13.240 --> 11:18.900
outnumbered by hordes of day and section hikers—with one major exception.

11:18.900 --> 11:22.940
Maine is the least densely populated state on the East Coast, and in the final weeks

11:22.940 --> 11:28.380
and days of their trips, thru-hikers start to pass through true wilderness—no towns,

11:28.380 --> 11:31.300
no cell service, hardly even road crossings.

11:31.300 --> 11:35.260
In fact, the last paved road they'll cross is the first one they'll have seen in a

11:35.260 --> 11:40.160
week and sits right on the border of Baxter State Park—by far the strictest one on the

11:40.160 --> 11:42.640
entire trail stretch.

11:42.640 --> 11:48.600
After months crossing heavily-used and loosely-regulated land, Baxter is an anomaly.

11:48.600 --> 11:53.640
Inside, infrastructure is limited—no electricity, no running water, no paved roads—and the

11:53.640 --> 11:55.360
rules are endless.

11:55.360 --> 12:00.500
No pets, no motorcycles, no outside firewood, no soap, no groups of more than 12, no vehicles

12:00.500 --> 12:04.820
longer than 22 feet, no children under 6 above the treeline—it's about as close to true

12:04.880 --> 12:08.640
wilderness one can get in a managed park, and the park's authority works hard to keep

12:08.640 --> 12:09.880
it that way.

12:09.880 --> 12:14.460
Therefore, Baxter strictly regulates visitor numbers, requiring elusive reservations for

12:14.460 --> 12:20.160
parking at most trailheads and sleeping in all campgrounds, with one notable exception.

12:20.160 --> 12:24.500
Reflecting the unpredictability of their arrival date, the park long allowed some Appalachian

12:24.500 --> 12:29.700
trail thru-hikers to enter unrestricted, granting the first 12 each day the right to pay $10

12:29.700 --> 12:34.460
to camp at the base of Mount Katahdin before the final miles of their months-long treks.

12:34.460 --> 12:38.260
After all, across all those months leading up to this moment, no matter which park the

12:38.260 --> 12:42.460
AT passed through, not a single trailside campground would have required reservations,

12:42.460 --> 12:47.380
meaning while this was an exception to Baxter's system, it was the norm for the ATs.

12:47.380 --> 12:52.580
In fact, this very norm—the boundless, uninhibited ability to simply point north, walk as far

12:52.580 --> 12:58.180
as possible, sleep, then do it again—was considered central to the allure of the trail.

12:58.180 --> 13:03.100
But, according to Baxter State Park, that allure, or at least the knowledge of that

13:03.100 --> 13:05.780
allure, had grown too strong.

13:05.780 --> 13:08.620
The public rhetoric escalated.

13:08.620 --> 13:13.540
Baxter alleged that, among myriad other concerns, AT hikers most flagrantly violated the park's

13:13.540 --> 13:15.700
group size limits and alcohol ban.

13:15.700 --> 13:20.200
After months on the same trail, hikers typically operated as one big nomadic social circle

13:20.200 --> 13:24.500
by the finish, leading many to want to finish together and celebrate at Katahdin's summit,

13:24.500 --> 13:28.380
leading to a party-like atmosphere that the park authority considered incompatible with

13:28.380 --> 13:30.700
its conservation-first goals.

13:30.740 --> 13:35.460
Ultimately, the straw that broke the camel's back appeared to be the incident in 2015,

13:35.460 --> 13:39.680
when legendary ultra-marathoner Scott Jurek completed a monumental feat.

13:39.680 --> 13:44.800
He had run the length of the trail in just 46 days—a new record that broke down to

13:44.800 --> 13:47.900
nearly two marathons' distance per day.

13:47.900 --> 13:51.500
Given the scale of the feat, a horde of media followed him to the summit, where he celebrated

13:51.500 --> 13:54.020
his achievement by spraying and drinking champagne.

13:54.020 --> 13:59.620
In acknowledgement of this, the park rewarded him with three legal summits—one for alcohol

13:59.620 --> 14:03.240
consumption, against the park's rules, one for littering, for the champagne that

14:03.240 --> 14:07.460
had been spilled, and one for a group size violation—since the media that followed

14:07.460 --> 14:10.380
totaled above the park's cap of 12.

14:10.380 --> 14:14.960
Inevitably, furious debate followed on whether some spilled champagne constituted littering,

14:14.960 --> 14:18.740
whether media following a soon-to-be record holder constituted a true group that Jurek

14:18.740 --> 14:23.020
was responsible for, and most of all on whether it was even right to cite the man for a short

14:23.020 --> 14:25.580
celebration of an all-time record.

14:25.580 --> 14:29.620
Jurek, on principle, took this to court where the group size and littering citations were

14:29.620 --> 14:33.460
dismissed, but this only escalated the larger conversation.

14:33.460 --> 14:38.420
Was the Appalachian Trail even compatible with Baxter's legally enshrined conservation-focused

14:38.420 --> 14:42.360
mission, and were Baxter's strict rules even justified by their conservation mission

14:42.360 --> 14:44.100
in the first place?

14:44.100 --> 14:47.180
The Baxter State Park Authority clearly wasn't waiting for an answer, though.

14:47.180 --> 14:51.860
They abruptly announced that, after nearly a century of limitless access along the entire

14:51.860 --> 14:57.380
stretch of the trail, Appalachian Trail thru-hikers would now be capped.

14:57.380 --> 15:04.780
As of 2017, only 3,150 would be allowed to complete their trek atop Mount Katahdin.

15:04.780 --> 15:09.020
Inevitably, this sparked uproar in the AT community.

15:09.020 --> 15:13.120
Hikers were near paranoid over the prospect of walking over 2,000 miles from Georgia and

15:13.120 --> 15:15.860
getting turned away in the final 15.

15:15.860 --> 15:19.620
They argued that the couple thousand annual thru-hikers couldn't possibly have a notable

15:19.620 --> 15:23.620
impact compared to the tens of thousands of car-based visitors each summer.

15:23.620 --> 15:28.280
They argued that, despite their legal right, Baxter State Park was simply just wrong to

15:28.280 --> 15:31.800
throw a near century of precedent out the window.

15:31.800 --> 15:34.180
The park came back with a simple argument.

15:34.180 --> 15:38.300
Percival Baxter very clearly indicated in his trust documents that the park's primary

15:38.300 --> 15:42.620
purpose was conservation, yet left no instructions as to the Appalachian Trail.

15:42.620 --> 15:47.580
Therefore, both in practice and in law, conservation came first.

15:47.580 --> 15:53.300
Ultimately, there was nothing AT hikers or the Appalachian Trail Conservancy could do.

15:53.300 --> 15:57.660
Some complained, others sympathized with Baxter's position, understanding that the park had

15:57.660 --> 16:02.440
a different mission than the trail, and, as their host, Baxter had every right to implement

16:02.440 --> 16:05.420
any rule or restriction they wanted.

16:05.420 --> 16:10.100
The showdown in Baxter was, in many ways, an accentuated microcosm of the debates happening

16:10.100 --> 16:12.100
more widely in the outdoors.

16:12.100 --> 16:16.440
It's a unique case in which one of the most heavily trafficked trails in the world, hosting

16:16.440 --> 16:20.560
at least 3 million people on a portion each year, interacts with one of the most strictly

16:20.560 --> 16:26.220
regulated parks in the world, made possible uniquely by its independent funding and management.

16:26.220 --> 16:30.080
Not all the debates happen in such stark terms, where the ultimate threat throughout has been

16:30.080 --> 16:35.200
the expulsion of the trail from the park, but it is the same debate—what sort of access

16:35.200 --> 16:37.320
should humans have to nature?

16:37.320 --> 16:39.400
How much is too much?

16:39.400 --> 16:43.560
There's essentially zero unmanaged nature left on earth.

16:43.560 --> 16:48.400
With limited exception, there just isn't empty public land operating without any regulatory

16:48.400 --> 16:49.400
body.

16:49.400 --> 16:53.280
Each and every one of these regulatory bodies picks somewhere between no access, pristine

16:53.280 --> 16:57.720
wilderness restricting all human access, which itself is not even the natural state, and

16:57.720 --> 17:02.940
unlimited access—another near impossible construct since infrastructure naturally caps

17:02.940 --> 17:04.600
access.

17:04.600 --> 17:06.680
There appears no perfect answer.

17:06.680 --> 17:11.400
You see, eliminating human access to nature has consequences.

17:11.400 --> 17:15.820
There is a seemingly endless body of academic research linking exposure to nature with positive

17:15.820 --> 17:20.240
effects on mental health, and it all seems to loosely link back to the biophilia theory—the

17:20.240 --> 17:24.320
idea that humans have some innate affinity to proximity to nature.

17:24.320 --> 17:29.640
There is an evolutionary explanation for this—after all, our ancestors were more likely to survive

17:29.640 --> 17:33.320
in resource-rich environments with lots of other forms of life.

17:33.320 --> 17:36.960
But perhaps stronger evidence is found in today's world where the average human lives

17:36.960 --> 17:40.760
in an urban area cut off from easy access to nature.

17:40.760 --> 17:43.620
Why do people spend time and money to raise pets?

17:43.620 --> 17:49.200
Why do people prefer live houseplains to less expensive artificial versions, even when indistinguishable?

17:49.200 --> 17:53.460
Why do people drive for hours to walk in the woods when they could just walk down the sidewalk?

17:53.460 --> 17:57.560
The questions about nature's curious draw could go on and on, but on the flip side,

17:57.560 --> 18:01.200
there are studies linking time and nature to higher levels of creativity, lower levels

18:01.200 --> 18:06.480
of stress, improved mood, and above all, higher self-reported personal well-being.

18:06.480 --> 18:10.640
And then, beyond the personal, nature-connectedness is linked to higher concern for nature's

18:10.640 --> 18:14.240
well-being, which, in a world threatened by the continual destruction of wilderness,

18:14.240 --> 18:18.320
at least theoretically implies humans with better access to nature will do more to save

18:18.320 --> 18:19.680
it.

18:19.680 --> 18:22.580
But unlimited access has its issues too.

18:22.580 --> 18:27.420
To start, many of those psychological benefits are linked to isolation—linked to the downstream

18:27.420 --> 18:30.600
effects of self-sufficiency in a wild space.

18:30.600 --> 18:34.800
Hiking angels landing with back-to-back traffic is absolutely a different experience with

18:34.800 --> 18:37.320
a lesser benefit than hiking it alone.

18:37.520 --> 18:42.320
Therefore, while impossible to quantify, there is absolutely a point where the marginal benefit

18:42.320 --> 18:46.400
that one additional person gains from being allowed on the trail is outweighed by the

18:46.400 --> 18:51.800
sum of the marginal detriment everyone else encounters due to a busier trail.

18:51.800 --> 18:54.400
But then there are the more practical concerns.

18:54.400 --> 18:57.800
Nature can be a dangerous environment where risks need to be properly mitigated, but the

18:57.800 --> 19:02.180
rise of the outdoors as a lifestyle trait or social media backdrop has perhaps masked

19:02.180 --> 19:03.180
this truth.

19:03.180 --> 19:07.000
Baxter State Park, for example, justifies much of its heavy-handedness with its need

19:07.000 --> 19:08.520
to keep visitors safe.

19:08.520 --> 19:13.220
Katahdin is a well-known, yet high-risk mountain in a region of America with relatively tamer

19:13.220 --> 19:14.220
nature.

19:14.220 --> 19:18.460
A hiker from Boston, for example, is likely not accustomed to the level of isolation or

19:18.460 --> 19:22.040
exposure that Katahdin presents, because there just aren't that many mountains with the

19:22.040 --> 19:24.620
same risk factor in the region.

19:24.620 --> 19:28.400
The reservations-only system means no one can make the spontaneous decision to hike

19:28.400 --> 19:32.540
Baxter without planning—they'll spend days or weeks researching before even getting

19:32.540 --> 19:34.480
to parking reservations.

19:34.640 --> 19:39.280
Upon arrival, Baxter Rangers are trained to essentially triage hikers at Katahdin trailheads,

19:39.280 --> 19:43.520
checking whether they have adequate footwear, clothing, supplies, and asking questions that,

19:43.520 --> 19:47.540
according to the park's director, are designed to subtly spook them—get them in the mindset

19:47.540 --> 19:51.840
that what they're about to do has risk and isn't just a walk in the park.

19:51.840 --> 19:56.460
Then, as a final filter, this foreboding sign is placed a half-mile up the trail to be read

19:56.460 --> 20:00.200
once the initial excitement of the day has worn off, and a more rational brain perhaps

20:00.200 --> 20:01.760
takes over.

20:01.760 --> 20:06.680
Despite these precautions, roughly one in every 2,000 Baxter visitors requires medical

20:06.680 --> 20:11.100
or search and rescue resources, far above the nationwide average, and more than 60 people

20:11.100 --> 20:14.440
have died while climbing Maine's tallest peak.

20:14.440 --> 20:19.120
Now, the question of how high the barrier to entry should be is a tricky one, as the

20:19.120 --> 20:24.760
outdoors is a domain dominated by a core demographic—it's primarily used by people who are wealthier,

20:24.760 --> 20:26.440
white, and male.

20:26.440 --> 20:30.120
This is something that the outdoor recreation industry especially is working to counter,

20:30.120 --> 20:33.600
since it makes it tougher to generate political support and limits their potential customer

20:33.600 --> 20:34.600
base.

20:34.600 --> 20:39.880
But it's no wonder why the outdoors has unintentionally been exclusionary—essentially,

20:39.880 --> 20:42.720
outdoorsy people created outdoorsy people.

20:42.720 --> 20:46.100
When climbing a mountain, for example, there's a lot of information worth knowing beyond

20:46.100 --> 20:47.680
where the trail starts.

20:47.680 --> 20:48.680
Has the snow melted?

20:48.680 --> 20:50.600
Did the approach road require a high-clearance vehicle?

20:50.600 --> 20:52.200
What's a safe turnaround time?

20:52.200 --> 20:53.680
What sort of equipment is warranted?

20:53.680 --> 20:54.680
How does the weather behave?

20:54.680 --> 20:56.240
What sort of experience is needed?

20:56.720 --> 21:01.280
In the past, this information flowed through old-school, person-to-person social networks—as

21:01.280 --> 21:05.320
in, climbers would disseminate information one-on-one to other climbers, which created

21:05.320 --> 21:09.320
an informal vetting system—essentially, more experienced climbers would only give

21:09.320 --> 21:13.200
the information to those that they thought were ready for the climb.

21:13.200 --> 21:18.280
Today, all the information and more is available on the internet, allowing anyone of any experience

21:18.280 --> 21:22.140
level the ability to get the information necessary to attempt a climb.

21:22.140 --> 21:27.320
In one way, this is good—it counters the unintentionally exclusionary nature of nature,

21:27.320 --> 21:31.780
allowing those without access to those person-to-person social networks the ability to engage in outdoor

21:31.780 --> 21:38.420
recreation, but it also means that that informal vetting process of the past has broken down.

21:38.420 --> 21:42.880
Information flows freely, even to those that don't have the experience to use it wisely.

21:42.880 --> 21:46.900
This is coupled with the increasing availability of communication in the backcountry.

21:46.900 --> 21:51.120
In recent years, relatively low-cost satellite messaging devices have hit the market that

21:51.120 --> 21:55.460
allow the injured and lost to call for help regardless of cell service, and now the iPhone

21:55.460 --> 21:57.560
14 includes a similar feature as well.

21:57.560 --> 22:01.620
While this has saved countless lives, it's also viewed as a contributing factor in the

22:01.620 --> 22:06.280
rise of search and rescue calls for those that are simply exhausted or unprepared.

22:06.280 --> 22:10.840
It essentially lowers individual consequences by forcing volunteer search and rescue personnel

22:10.840 --> 22:14.240
into the field in potentially hazardous conditions more often.

22:14.680 --> 22:20.040
In fact, in 2016, a majority of search and rescue calls in national parks were for these

22:20.040 --> 22:21.040
reasons.

22:21.040 --> 22:26.320
Therefore, too low of a barrier to entry is a risk considering the outdoors is an environment

22:26.320 --> 22:31.300
where people routinely underestimate risk—where people prepare for the best-case scenario

22:31.300 --> 22:32.840
rather than the worst.

22:32.840 --> 22:37.220
Too high of a barrier to entry is also a risk since it deprives access to those that want

22:37.220 --> 22:41.560
to gain its benefits, and leaves more questioning whether outdoor recreation has value worth

22:41.560 --> 22:43.040
protecting.

22:43.040 --> 22:48.440
This is why these areas require such careful management—the outdoors is a scarce resource

22:48.440 --> 22:51.820
that must be protected in perpetuity.

22:51.820 --> 22:56.120
Even under the most recreation-first mindset, the mission is to allow access to the most

22:56.120 --> 23:01.160
number of people possible, but some of those people have not even been born yet—the outdoors

23:01.160 --> 23:03.800
is considered in a timescale of forever.

23:03.800 --> 23:09.880
It's a game of finding the line of non-consumptive use.

23:09.880 --> 23:14.200
Simply finding that line is near impossible in the best of times, but what makes it ever

23:14.200 --> 23:18.920
more difficult is a massive influx of people attempting to push that line.

23:18.920 --> 23:23.700
The outdoors is not an environment compatible with the surges that an information-rich society

23:23.700 --> 23:24.700
cultivates.

23:24.700 --> 23:30.140
It's essentially a situation without a solution—one remedied only by an overworked army of land

23:30.140 --> 23:34.580
managers tasked with the impossible feat of keeping a sum intact while allowing millions

23:34.580 --> 23:38.840
to subtract from it, one step at a time.

23:38.840 --> 23:43.440
One fascinating fact about the outdoors in the US is that there is no nationwide search

23:43.440 --> 23:44.960
and rescue system.

23:44.960 --> 23:49.080
When you push that SOS button, who comes and saves you is pretty much down to what county

23:49.080 --> 23:50.080
you're in.

23:50.080 --> 23:53.400
Sometimes it's just going to be a sheriff's deputy with zero search and rescue training,

23:53.400 --> 23:56.720
but more often it's a group of completely volunteer rescuers.

23:56.720 --> 24:01.480
But these rescuers know what they're doing—they're doctors, nurses, and EMTs, highly skilled

24:01.480 --> 24:05.680
trail runners and climbers and kayakers, all individuals who have donated their time to

24:05.680 --> 24:10.080
learn the time-tested techniques behind finding someone, stabilizing their condition, and

24:10.080 --> 24:14.040
extracting them from the most remote and dangerous environments on earth.

24:14.040 --> 24:17.680
We wanted to learn more about this, so we made a whole episode of our Nebula original

24:17.680 --> 24:20.720
series Logistics of X about this exact subject.

24:20.720 --> 24:25.200
It was really fascinating—we did a deep dive into how some real rescues on Mount Hood

24:25.200 --> 24:28.760
worked using stunning 3D graphics and some really phenomenal footage.

24:28.760 --> 24:33.260
I found it so fascinating because there's so much technique and purpose into what might

24:33.260 --> 24:36.420
seem like the straightforward task of just finding someone and getting them out of the

24:36.420 --> 24:37.420
wilderness.

24:37.420 --> 24:41.620
And this is only one episode of the series—the first one was about the logistics of ski resorts,

24:41.620 --> 24:45.540
which is another thing that is way more complicated than it initially seems, and we're already

24:45.540 --> 24:48.340
well into production for future episodes.

24:48.340 --> 24:52.740
And this is only one series out of a whole catalog of others on Nebula made by creators

24:52.740 --> 24:54.900
that you probably already watch and enjoy.

24:54.900 --> 24:59.140
The idea behind Nebula is simple—these are creators that know how to make really good

24:59.140 --> 25:03.020
content on a tight budget that millions of people enjoy, so it only makes sense that

25:03.020 --> 25:06.940
if you give them a little more budget, they can make even better content.

25:06.940 --> 25:10.500
I couldn't possibly go over it all, but some of my favorites are Under Exposure by

25:10.500 --> 25:14.940
Neel, Modern Conflicts by RealLifeLore, and Tip of the Spear by Mustard.

25:14.940 --> 25:18.400
Of course, on top of all the originals, every single one of these creators uploads their

25:18.400 --> 25:22.100
videos ad- and sponsorship-free on Nebula, so you have a better viewing experience for

25:22.100 --> 25:26.620
normal content, exclusive additional content, and all of this is made possible by a business

25:26.620 --> 25:30.060
model that is more sustainable for creators themselves.

25:30.100 --> 25:34.540
Over 50,000 Wendover viewers have signed up to date, and the majority are still subscribed,

25:34.540 --> 25:38.300
meaning they clearly liked it, so if you want to watch the logistics of X, get the best

25:38.300 --> 25:42.260
viewing experience of our videos, and help support the channel, head to nebula.tv slash

25:42.260 --> 25:46.200
Wendover to sign up, and you'll even get $20 off an annual subscription there, which

25:46.200 --> 25:49.980
brings the monthly cost down to just $2.50.
