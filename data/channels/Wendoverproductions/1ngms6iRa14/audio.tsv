0	3340	California is an island.
3340	7780	Not literally, of course, but geography and history has subjected the state to the same
7780	12740	pressures and influences that make actual islands so insular.
12740	16000	Towering mountains separate the bulk of the state from its neighbors, but America's
16000	20600	largest desert places hundreds of miles of harsh, sparsely populated landscape between
20600	23620	it and the more populated states farther east.
23620	28820	Conversely, the largest, richest, and most influential cities in California all sit on
28820	33280	the coast—San Diego, Los Angeles, and San Francisco.
33280	35320	This is no coincidence.
35320	40240	Granted statehood in 1850, California began its interaction with the rest of the nation
40240	41600	by ocean.
41600	45920	It did not border any other state—the next nearest was Texas.
45920	50520	The interior was considered hostile, dangerous wilderness, but also just fundamentally lacked
50520	54980	roads so steamships would leave from the east coast, snake through the Caribbean, and drop
54980	56880	off passengers in Panama.
56880	61000	There, travelers would cross the country by foot and horse and boat to get to Panama
61000	64920	City, where they'd wait for another steamship to bring them to California.
64920	70620	At best a 30- or 40-day trip, but incredibly the fastest way to get from one half of America
70620	71900	to the other.
71900	76240	This disconnect meant California initially operated more like a colony, especially considering
76240	80900	that until telegraph lines spanned the country a decade later, this weeks-long trip was also
80900	84540	the fastest way to get information from coast to coast.
84540	90240	It wasn't until the Transcontinental Railroad was completed in 1869 that the state was truly,
90240	94700	reliably connected to the rest of the country by land, giving California two foundational
94700	98600	decades to define its identity in isolation.
98600	104920	This legacy persists—the disconnect exhibits in small ways that stack up into a meaningful
104920	105920	sum.
105920	110160	For example, most of the rest of the country is linked by a network of oil pipelines, allowing
110160	115120	for cheap and efficient transport of the resource from well to refinery to pump.
115120	118720	California's different—with those towering mountains and desolate deserts separating
118720	123220	it from the east, the economics never worked out to extend the pipeline to the state.
123220	127880	Therefore, California largely buys crude oil from foreign countries, imports it on enormous
127880	132300	tanker ships, and refines it locally which, in addition to the state's strict environmental
132300	137180	regulations, explains the higher prices typically seen at their pumps.
137200	141460	California even has a small degree of disconnect to the rest of the American road network—it's
141460	145580	the only state that requires all travelers to pass through any sort of border formality
145580	146580	when driving in.
146580	151660	It's not immigration per se, rather an agricultural inspection to check for invasive species,
151660	155820	but the point is not that these checks themselves significantly separate the state from the
155820	156880	rest.
156880	161740	More so, the fact that California is able to isolate and protect itself from pests prevalent
161740	166260	in the rest of the country with any degree of success demonstrates just how naturally
166260	168360	disconnected it is.
168360	173600	The only state to have a similarly extensive agricultural inspection system is Hawaii,
173600	175980	made up of literal islands.
175980	182940	But the reason California can be so isolated is because it's really absurdly filthy rich.
182940	187940	The state's center, if defined by wealth concentration, is here—Silicon Valley.
187940	193140	It'd be easy to assume the area's riches are overstated, but the numbers offer a quick
193140	194460	counterpoint.
194460	198980	To Clara, San Mateo, and San Francisco, the three counties that encompass the core of
198980	205960	Silicon Valley, have a collective GDP of $725 billion.
205960	212360	This is closest to that of Poland, the 21st largest nation in the world, home to 38 million
212360	213360	people.
213360	217300	The uninitiated might assume that San Francisco and Silicon Valley are more or less one in
217300	218300	the same.
218300	222120	Sure, San Francisco has a big tech scene, but the major headquarters are distributed
222120	226680	across the towns and cities to the south of it—Google is in Mountain View, Apple
226680	229600	is in Cupertino, Netflix is in Los Gatos.
229600	234280	What this means is that these titans of tech, some of the largest companies in the world,
234280	241200	are headquartered in some rather small cities—82,000, 60,000, and 34,000 residents, respectively.
241200	246320	Therefore, they're regulated by tiny, hyper-competitive local governments.
246320	250560	In fact, San Francisco, the city you know best, is not even the largest city in the
250560	252640	San Francisco Bay Area.
252640	259720	San Jose has 983,000 residents to San Francisco's 815,000 because the entire area is just subdivided
259720	265120	into a huge number of smaller cities and towns, which is a bit of a trend.
265120	269780	Los Angeles County, encompassing most but not even all of the metro area, is composed
269780	273740	of 88 different cities plus unincorporated areas.
273740	278780	Across both of the state's largest urbanized masses, what functions like one city operates
278780	286100	as dozens, even hundreds, leaving few comprehensive, overarching bodies to align incentives.
286100	290360	Zoomed in, considering the odd relationship and power dynamics of neighboring communities,
290360	295120	or zoomed out, considering the state's historical and contemporary isolation, California's
295120	298080	as unique a state there is.
298080	303320	Uniqueness has brought benefits, but uniqueness has also created unique problems, and bizarre,
303320	306400	sometimes convoluted, means of solving them.
306400	308400	Take homelessness.
308400	313220	This is a hot-button, highly visible issue with complicated causes and largely theoretical
313220	317420	solutions, so it's easy for conversations over it to spiral out of scale.
317420	323260	A quick look at the statistics, however, makes one thing unmistakably clear—California's
323260	326340	homelessness problem is uniquely bad.
326340	336300	Of the 582,462 people experiencing homelessness nationwide in 2022, 171,521 were in California.
336840	342360	That's nearly 30% of the nation's total, but for comparison, some 97,000 more than
342360	349480	New York and some 150,000 more than Florida—the states with the second and third largest homeless
349480	350480	populations.
350480	353360	But California is the most populous state in the nation, so this should be considered
353360	355440	at a per-resonant rate.
355440	360240	And here, too, California outpaces the rest, with 44 people experiencing homelessness per
360240	361700	10,000.
361700	366600	For troubling still, despite the highest total and the highest rate, the problem's only
366600	368200	getting worse.
368200	374400	From 2020 to 2022, while 23 states saw decreases in their homeless populations, California's
374400	377440	rose by another 6%, 10,000 people.
377440	383720	So it's a big, bad, and worsening problem, and while it's at the top of meeting agendas
383720	388560	from small city halls all the way to Sacramento, it doesn't look like it'll be fixed anytime
388560	389560	soon.
389580	393420	While the state has figured out how to solve homelessness, it is generally understood that
393420	398100	providing stable shelters and housing programs is associated with lowering numbers.
398100	402140	It tracks, then, that California has comparatively little in the way of shelter beds, as the
402140	406620	state has instead opted to prioritize permanent housing projects which have proved expensive
406620	408780	and incredibly slow to build.
408780	412140	This has left more and more out in the relative cold.
412140	416860	In 2022, two-thirds of California's homeless were considered unsheltered—living out
416860	421560	of tents, cars, campers, or on the streets, far from shelters and services that could
421560	423520	potentially turn things around.
423520	427840	Now, the state government has watched this problem grow and spread, and tried to think
427840	431640	of solutions while throwing millions upon millions of dollars at it.
431640	436360	Yet, the state has the largest, most visible homeless problem in the nation, and has little
436360	441140	in the way of solutions, or even stop gaps in place to alleviate the issue.
441140	445140	Much of this is the function of a simple reality that the state government has surprisingly
445140	446440	little control over.
446520	450260	It's really hard to build in California.
450260	453540	The difficulty in finding housing extends to everyone here.
453540	455940	The state is in the middle of a housing crisis.
455940	459940	But this isn't because of a faltering economy or meager wages.
459940	464940	California year-in-year-out ranks as one of the highest average income states in the nation,
464940	470140	and yet, in one analysis of 2019 numbers, when adjusted for cost of living, it plummets
470140	471900	to 48th.
471900	476300	Rather than unemployment or low-paying jobs, it's the sky-high cost of living that puts
476300	479560	so many so perilously close to losing a home.
479560	482640	All it could take is one medical emergency.
482640	487800	Bizarrely, the explanation could be that the state's economy is too strong for its own
487800	488800	good.
488800	493720	Take this simple metric—the jobs-housing ratio, which considers how many jobs are created
493720	497600	in relation to how many units of housing are added to a given area.
497600	501680	For local employment to remain healthy, without adding to congestion, traffic, or displacing
501680	507420	longtime residents, the US EPA considers a ratio ranging from 0.75 to 1.5 as healthy
507420	508700	for an urban area.
508700	513820	In the last decade, popular cities clearly on the rise have begun to push the upper reaches
513820	514820	of this range.
514820	522060	Phoenix's metro area sits at 1.34, Seattle's 1.43, Austin's 1.47, and Denver's 1.73,
522060	526140	but California has blown the roof off this range.
526140	531040	The LA-Long Beach-Anaheim metro topped 2, Riverside-San Bernardino-Ontario has reached
531040	536820	2.72, and the San Jose-Sunnyvale-Santa Clara ratio of new jobs per unit of housing hit
536820	541480	a truly staggering 3.19.
541480	546320	Of course, an unrelenting economy only accounts for the numerator here—the jobs.
546320	550040	The denominator is just as responsible for the state's housing crisis, but this is
550040	555880	the outcome of a concept a bit more nebulous—the California Dream.
555880	559880	Of all the floating, intangible assumptions as to what life in California is supposed
559880	564340	to look like—the long, sunny days and pleasant temperatures, along with the plethora of good
564340	568780	jobs, beaches, and open space—it's the single-family home with a lawn and perhaps
568780	573780	a pool that's proved the most important, the most concrete, and currently the most
573780	574780	controversial.
574780	578860	And it's this core tenet that's causing such massive problems.
578860	583020	Californians, after all, desperately want to keep what they were sold on, and they're
583020	585700	willing to fight for it.
585700	590640	Take Atherton, a small Silicon Valley town just minutes away from Stanford.
590640	595320	In 2022, to keep up with state mandates on housing requirements, the city council began
595320	600700	the process of rezoning one single-family lot to build an apartment building.
600700	602680	The project was quickly axed.
602680	607600	It wasn't a lack of money or a lack of municipal will—it was axed because the city's most
607600	612400	influential, powerful executives and even basketball player Steph Curry banded together
612400	614920	and pressured the city out of it.
614920	619220	To them, the project would hurt their property values, cut off their views, change the character
619220	624520	of the community, and create more traffic—so the project, and its 16 units of desperately
624520	629620	needed housing, died on the vine and forced city planners back to the drawing board.
629620	633820	While the characters might not be as high profile as those in Atherton, this happens
633820	636660	all the time all over the state.
636660	641100	Here, the city government decided to designate itself as a mountain lion sanctuary, which
641100	645560	was odd, but conveniently allowed it to forgo new housing development.
645560	651900	Here, in 2019, construction on a 154-bed shelter broke ground, only for Venice Beach to sue
651900	654360	the city of Los Angeles to halt construction.
654360	659240	Here, residents of San Francisco's Embarcadero area did the same, suing the city over establishing
659240	661640	a 200-bed shelter in the same neighborhood.
661640	666440	And across the larger Bay Area, those who want California to stay the same low-density
666440	671020	California of old have created their own organizations, councils, and committees—Better
671020	674580	Cupertino and Palo Alto for Sensible Zoning, to name a few.
674580	676180	This isn't just a fringe.
676180	680660	More and more, anti-density proponents are winning local elections.
680660	683820	All of this is, after all, in the local interest.
683820	689040	If one small town has enough power to push the problem over to the next, clearly a constituency
689040	692980	will opt for that over something that could damage their property values.
692980	697060	The state has the money and the interest in solving its problems with homelessness and
697060	701520	housing shortages, but it can only do so much when powerful local governments resist even
701520	705600	the most minor of zoning changes and the smallest of housing projects.
705600	710880	So, unexceptional problems have grown to exceptional size, and as the unexceptional solution of
710880	716400	simply building more housing gets rejected, the state legislature turns to the spectacular—launching
716400	720820	projects to systematically convert motels into housing units, backing anti-NIMBY laws,
720820	724080	and filing lawsuits against its own cities.
724080	727880	And all of this absurd mess is confined to the issue of housing.
727880	729880	There are, of course, fires.
729880	733720	There's also too much water in some places, and too little in others.
733720	737800	There's spats about who deserves Colorado River water at the state level and at the
737800	738800	local level.
738800	742680	There's traffic, there's aging infrastructure, there's companies leaving the state, and
742680	744480	middle-class workers following them.
744480	748720	There's a lot of bickering, and a lot to bicker about.
748720	754520	Clearly, problems have accumulated in California to an untenable level, and systematically,
754520	757380	they aren't getting solved.
757380	763300	Something seems fundamentally wrong with the state, so maybe it needs a fundamental solution.
763300	765320	Maybe California should just be a country.
765320	767340	It sounds ludicrous, right?
767340	770100	Of course California can't become a country—it would never happen.
770100	771980	Congress would never allow it.
771980	776580	But perhaps the point worth focusing on is how much less ludicrous it sounds when considering
776580	777820	the argument.
777820	781600	After all, California wouldn't be out of place as a country—it would rank 59th in
781600	786800	physical size between Iraq and Paraguay, 38th in population between Canada and Poland,
786800	792040	and 5th in GDP between Germany and India—so it'd actually be above average on all major
792040	793800	metrics of scale.
793800	797960	One of the common refrains against secession movements is that breakaway regions could
797960	800400	not survive economically on their own.
800400	804920	For example, according to the UK government, for every dollar Scotland pays in taxes, it
804920	808200	receives about $1.32 back.
808200	813780	The country would have an immediate and dramatic budget deficit upon full independence.
813780	818380	This fact undergirds some of the strongest hesitancies among Scots themselves on the
818380	819380	matter.
819380	821020	But California's different.
821020	826780	In 2019, before the pandemic skewed the data, the state received just 97 cents back in federal
826780	830020	spending for every dollar it sent the federal government.
830020	834460	This put the state, each year, in a small camp of around 10 that received less than
834460	838840	what they gave, while others, like Mississippi, Kentucky, and West Virginia, consistently
838840	842520	received more than $2 back for every dollar they sent.
842520	845320	Of course, this is by design.
845320	849880	The US's progressive tax system is supposed to take disproportionately from the wealthy
849880	854160	and give disproportionately to the less wealthy, but from California's perspective, many
854160	858640	wonder why they're sending all their dollars to unappreciative states thousands of miles
858640	859880	away.
859880	864340	And adding to that, California doesn't even get as much of a say in how those dollars
864340	865740	get spent.
865740	870100	Given the unequal distribution of electoral votes in presidential elections, every individual
870100	875620	in Wyoming has the voting power of about 3.7 Californians, while the Senate system of two
875620	880660	senators per state, regardless of population, further compounds this weak representation.
880660	886140	Again, the system was purposely designed hundreds of years ago to amplify the voices of smaller
886140	891460	states, but from California's perspective, they get the short end of that stick.
891460	896000	Feeling underrepresented by Washington, California has long legislated less like a state and
896000	900800	more like a nation, passing sweeping, powerful laws when it feels like the federal government
900800	902000	can't or won't.
902000	906320	For example, it's long had a ban on assault rifles, similar to the one that the Biden
906320	910320	administration is attempting to pass, it's announced a ban on gas-powered vehicles by
910320	915600	2035, similar to other bans passed by countries, it's established its own immigration law,
915600	918980	partially focused on educating detainees on their rights prior to handing them over
918980	923400	to what the state might characterize as abusive federal authorities, it's even formed relationships
923400	928720	with countries, having signed a joint environmental accord with New Zealand at COP26.
928720	933580	In many ways, fixing perceived federal shortcomings has become a central focus of Californian
933580	939560	politics, but unsurprisingly, this dynamic has spurred tensions with DC, especially when
939560	942380	federal power sways towards the right.
942380	946060	There certainly is not the political will for California's secession right now, not
946060	951080	even close, but if there was one big perceived encroachment on California's rights, a knockdown
951080	955560	of their assault rifle ban or a nationwide abortion ban, one could imagine that political
955560	957340	will accumulating quickly.
957340	961920	But it's still a largely moot point, because it would almost certainly be fixing a problem
961920	964460	by creating a bigger problem.
964460	968480	As much as California might be held back by sending dollars to Washington or sitting subject
968480	973820	to its laws, the state is massively buoyed by its inclusion in the largest economy in
973820	974820	the world.
974820	979620	Removing itself from the US would have dire economic consequences that would surely outweigh
979620	981100	any gain.
981100	983380	Perhaps the closest equivalent is Brexit.
983380	987160	Much of the political will came from a belief that the European Union was taking the country's
987160	991620	money and encroaching on its sovereignty, but now, just a few years on, with mounting
991620	996260	issues on trade and travel, public opinion has shifted decisively towards regret—most
996260	1002040	agree that removing the UK from the world's third largest economy was not the right move.
1002040	1006400	Public opinion on Californian independence has never neared a majority, but there have
1006400	1011040	been enough fringe movement seeking secession that the question has been included in legitimate
1011040	1015920	political polling, reliably demonstrating surprising support for the idea—between
1015920	1020760	14 and 32% of respondents were for Californian nationhood.
1020760	1026200	In fact, in one poll run by a Stanford-affiliated think tank, the 18-to-29 demographic responded
1026200	1032540	as 36% for and just 40% against, almost even, demonstrating that, while majority opinion
1032540	1038380	is not nearly in support of the extreme, unprecedented measure of modern state secession, the perceived
1038380	1044140	disconnect with Washington has pushed the idea up to surprising levels of legitimacy.
1044140	1049340	We all know pragmatically that secession will never happen in anything close to this reality,
1049340	1051700	but partition could.
1051700	1056800	The underlying idea is the same—that California is big, underrepresented, overtaxed.
1056800	1061360	The solution is just less extreme—split it into smaller states.
1061360	1066180	This has been proposed legitimately over 200 times, and the most recent concerted push
1066180	1069900	was led by billionaire investor Tim Draper in 2018.
1069900	1073820	He proposed splitting the state into three parts called Northern California, Southern
1073820	1078920	California, and California, attempting to balance population, wealth, and politics somewhat
1078920	1080560	evenly across the three.
1080560	1084600	The central argument was that the state government was out of touch with local governments given
1084600	1088080	the huge difference in size between the two and that the federal government was out of
1088080	1092400	touch with the state government given the diluted representation, so the solution was
1092400	1097000	to reduce the size of the state and also, given the two senators-per-state system, give
1097000	1100560	more powerful federal representation to the population.
1100560	1106120	The argument was persuasive enough to generate far more than 367,000 signatures necessary
1106120	1110560	to put the question on the ballot, but, before election day, it was struck down by the state
1110560	1113300	supreme court on constitutional grounds.
1113300	1118560	Even so, it probably wouldn't have passed—polling showed its support between 13 and 17%, but
1118560	1122140	even if the state did vote for it, it'd then be up to the federal government to approve
1122140	1127040	such a split, and the federal government would almost certainly never approve a split.
1127040	1131020	Democrats would balk at the fact that it would fracture a strongly Democratic state, Republicans
1131020	1135400	would balk at the four additional left-leaning Congresspeople it would send to DC, everyone
1135400	1138720	would ask whether it'd be too dangerous a precedent to establish.
1138720	1143840	So, the big solutions aren't reasonable, and the small solutions aren't working.
1143840	1147120	Perhaps the answer is that California is just too unique.
1147120	1150000	Because it definitely is unique.
1150000	1154920	There is no state, region, or other national subdivision with a larger economy on earth,
1154920	1158640	and going down the list, there aren't really even near equivalents.
1158640	1163120	Texas is number two, but it's run by small government conservatives, meaning state intervention
1163120	1164840	on problems is limited.
1164840	1169280	New York is number three, but nearly all of its GDP is concentrated in one massive metro
1169280	1172020	area, meaning its structure is far simpler.
1172020	1176520	You then have England, but it acts as a nation within a nation, then Guangdong and Chengsu,
1176520	1181040	but China isn't a Democratic state, then Florida, but it has a Texas-style small government
1181040	1186400	bent, then Chengdong and Sichang, also China, then Illinois, mostly one city, then Henon,
1186400	1189160	also China, then finally Pennsylvania.
1189160	1193560	With its comparatively conservative, smaller government politics, it's not a great equivalent
1193560	1198200	to California, but it's the closest so far considering its wealth is somewhat geographically
1198200	1202520	distributed and its government is more open to intervention than in Florida or Texas.
1202520	1207720	So that's to say, California is not only unique to the rest of the US, it's unique
1207720	1209560	to the world.
1209560	1216520	Truly nobody is trying to manage such a big economy with anything less than nation status.
1216520	1221160	It has unique problems, it feels disconnected from the nation, it lacks the power of the
1221160	1225440	nation, and yet it feels like it needs to act like a nation.
1225440	1230440	This should sound familiar, because in 1776, thirteen North American colonies declared
1230440	1234520	independence from Britain, citing their unique problems, feeling of disconnection, lack of
1234520	1239960	nation-scale power, and an inkling that just being a nation was a way to fix it all.
1239960	1242720	What happened next was America.
1242720	1249040	What happened after that was American exceptionalism—the belief that the US is fundamentally and dramatically
1249040	1250500	unique.
1250500	1256740	This is, in many ways, true—there just aren't places that mirror the US's scale, geography,
1256740	1261540	and demographics, but this feeling undergirds perhaps the most fundamental feature of American
1261540	1267820	politics—a belief that, as a unique place, the US needs unique solutions.
1267820	1272900	There is a systematic rejection of solutions that have repeatedly worked in close cultural
1272900	1276780	equivalence out of a belief that they're incompatible with either what makes America
1276780	1279340	unique or the uniqueness itself.
1279340	1283960	So that means that California is the exception to the exception.
1283960	1289220	The state is exceptional—it is fundamentally different to the rest of the nation, and therefore
1289220	1294320	an analogous idea of Californian exceptionalism permeates through Sacramento undergirding
1294320	1298160	a belief that they too require unique solutions.
1298160	1302980	After all, California's supposed to be the land of economic opportunity—a destination
1302980	1307940	free of persecution, an idyllic antithesis to the status quo.
1307940	1311940	California is America's America.
1311940	1318260	The exception to the exception is not the norm—it's something more than the exception.
1318260	1323100	California is like the hyper-distilled version of America itself, developing for many of
1323100	1327260	the same reasons as the nation itself, just a century or two on.
1327260	1332200	It's no wonder that the state centered on rejecting norms from the country centered
1332200	1336160	on rejecting norms might stray from the most obvious path.
1336160	1341320	It's also no wonder that, in the same way America itself becomes the infatuation of
1341320	1346900	international media, a source of political entertainment, so too does California to the
1346900	1347900	US.
1347900	1351640	At the end of the day, Californian politicians might just be terrible.
1351640	1355980	The GLP talking points might be right, and the state might be the evidence that liberal
1355980	1360440	politics are structurally flawed, but it's near impossible to sift through the political
1360440	1364120	rhetoric and actually objectively analyze this.
1364120	1369520	However, it's reasonably clear that Californian politicians, like American politicians, have
1369520	1374200	a tougher job to do navigating a truly singular situation.
1374200	1378480	Decisions are made without precedent, and then in retrospect, with precedent established,
1378480	1380160	failures seem obvious.
1380160	1384560	So, the question of how to solve California's problems is more so the question of how to
1384560	1386860	solve America's problems.
1386860	1391380	Should it keep trying to find something new, to fight exceptionalism with exceptionalism,
1391380	1397580	or can unexceptional solutions work for unexceptional problems even when they happen in exceptional
1397580	1399900	places?
1399900	1403940	Last year, in a video about carbon offsets, we covered California's unique cap-and-trade
1403940	1407740	program, which was supposed to be an elegant way to curb industrial emissions, but in practice
1407740	1412340	propped up ineffective carbon offsets and illogical forest management practices.
1412340	1415100	This is a classic story in the carbon offsetting world.
1415140	1419340	It's a concept that works in theory, but regularly fails in practice.
1419340	1423460	That's because carbon offsets are really only as good as the entity managing them.
1423460	1427140	That's why I'm so excited to have Wren as a sponsor.
1427140	1431280	I didn't trust Wren at first—nobody should really trust any carbon offsetting provider
1431280	1435980	at first, as the industry is ripe with scams—but because they were interested in sponsoring
1435980	1439820	and were insistent they had found solutions to the problems I highlighted in my video,
1439820	1442900	I got on a call with them and they walked me through their process.
1442900	1443900	I left impressed.
1443900	1447700	I did my absolute best grilling them, but they had thoughtful answers for how they vet
1447700	1449460	their projects and ensure efficacy.
1449460	1454020	For example, even the most highly vetted carbon offsetting projects can go wrong when put
1454020	1459100	into practice, so they counter this by never selling offsets linked to a single project—only
1459100	1463380	for their portfolio of projects, designed to balance things out so that, if one project
1463380	1466740	falls through, the others are there to pull the average up.
1466740	1470260	This also means they can use some of the money to fund more experimental processes, like
1470260	1474340	mineral weathering, hoping that it can develop into a lower-cost offsetting method in the
1474340	1475340	future.
1475340	1479640	I really get the sense that Wren is the real deal—it's run by a small team of dedicated
1479640	1483700	people passionate about providing an easy way for people to rectify their personal emissions,
1483700	1487780	so that's why I decided to promote them over every other carbon offsetting provider
1487780	1488860	that asked.
1488860	1492940	I use Wren for both my personal and business offsetting because I can trust them to do
1492940	1497100	everything possible to make sure my money actually leads to carbon offset.
