1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,340
California is an island.

2
00:00:03,340 --> 00:00:07,780
Not literally, of course, but geography and history has subjected the state to the same

3
00:00:07,780 --> 00:00:12,740
pressures and influences that make actual islands so insular.

4
00:00:12,740 --> 00:00:16,000
Towering mountains separate the bulk of the state from its neighbors, but America's

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,600
largest desert places hundreds of miles of harsh, sparsely populated landscape between

6
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:23,620
it and the more populated states farther east.

7
00:00:23,620 --> 00:00:28,820
Conversely, the largest, richest, and most influential cities in California all sit on

8
00:00:28,820 --> 00:00:33,280
the coast—San Diego, Los Angeles, and San Francisco.

9
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:35,320
This is no coincidence.

10
00:00:35,320 --> 00:00:40,240
Granted statehood in 1850, California began its interaction with the rest of the nation

11
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:41,600
by ocean.

12
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:45,920
It did not border any other state—the next nearest was Texas.

13
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:50,520
The interior was considered hostile, dangerous wilderness, but also just fundamentally lacked

14
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:54,980
roads so steamships would leave from the east coast, snake through the Caribbean, and drop

15
00:00:54,980 --> 00:00:56,880
off passengers in Panama.

16
00:00:56,880 --> 00:01:01,000
There, travelers would cross the country by foot and horse and boat to get to Panama

17
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,920
City, where they'd wait for another steamship to bring them to California.

18
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:10,620
At best a 30- or 40-day trip, but incredibly the fastest way to get from one half of America

19
00:01:10,620 --> 00:01:11,900
to the other.

20
00:01:11,900 --> 00:01:16,240
This disconnect meant California initially operated more like a colony, especially considering

21
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:20,900
that until telegraph lines spanned the country a decade later, this weeks-long trip was also

22
00:01:20,900 --> 00:01:24,540
the fastest way to get information from coast to coast.

23
00:01:24,540 --> 00:01:30,240
It wasn't until the Transcontinental Railroad was completed in 1869 that the state was truly,

24
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:34,700
reliably connected to the rest of the country by land, giving California two foundational

25
00:01:34,700 --> 00:01:38,600
decades to define its identity in isolation.

26
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:44,920
This legacy persists—the disconnect exhibits in small ways that stack up into a meaningful

27
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:45,920
sum.

28
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:50,160
For example, most of the rest of the country is linked by a network of oil pipelines, allowing

29
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:55,120
for cheap and efficient transport of the resource from well to refinery to pump.

30
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:58,720
California's different—with those towering mountains and desolate deserts separating

31
00:01:58,720 --> 00:02:03,220
it from the east, the economics never worked out to extend the pipeline to the state.

32
00:02:03,220 --> 00:02:07,880
Therefore, California largely buys crude oil from foreign countries, imports it on enormous

33
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:12,300
tanker ships, and refines it locally which, in addition to the state's strict environmental

34
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:17,180
regulations, explains the higher prices typically seen at their pumps.

35
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:21,460
California even has a small degree of disconnect to the rest of the American road network—it's

36
00:02:21,460 --> 00:02:25,580
the only state that requires all travelers to pass through any sort of border formality

37
00:02:25,580 --> 00:02:26,580
when driving in.

38
00:02:26,580 --> 00:02:31,660
It's not immigration per se, rather an agricultural inspection to check for invasive species,

39
00:02:31,660 --> 00:02:35,820
but the point is not that these checks themselves significantly separate the state from the

40
00:02:35,820 --> 00:02:36,880
rest.

41
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:41,740
More so, the fact that California is able to isolate and protect itself from pests prevalent

42
00:02:41,740 --> 00:02:46,260
in the rest of the country with any degree of success demonstrates just how naturally

43
00:02:46,260 --> 00:02:48,360
disconnected it is.

44
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:53,600
The only state to have a similarly extensive agricultural inspection system is Hawaii,

45
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:55,980
made up of literal islands.

46
00:02:55,980 --> 00:03:02,940
But the reason California can be so isolated is because it's really absurdly filthy rich.

47
00:03:02,940 --> 00:03:07,940
The state's center, if defined by wealth concentration, is here—Silicon Valley.

48
00:03:07,940 --> 00:03:13,140
It'd be easy to assume the area's riches are overstated, but the numbers offer a quick

49
00:03:13,140 --> 00:03:14,460
counterpoint.

50
00:03:14,460 --> 00:03:18,980
To Clara, San Mateo, and San Francisco, the three counties that encompass the core of

51
00:03:18,980 --> 00:03:25,960
Silicon Valley, have a collective GDP of $725 billion.

52
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:32,360
This is closest to that of Poland, the 21st largest nation in the world, home to 38 million

53
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:33,360
people.

54
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:37,300
The uninitiated might assume that San Francisco and Silicon Valley are more or less one in

55
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:38,300
the same.

56
00:03:38,300 --> 00:03:42,120
Sure, San Francisco has a big tech scene, but the major headquarters are distributed

57
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:46,680
across the towns and cities to the south of it—Google is in Mountain View, Apple

58
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:49,600
is in Cupertino, Netflix is in Los Gatos.

59
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:54,280
What this means is that these titans of tech, some of the largest companies in the world,

60
00:03:54,280 --> 00:04:01,200
are headquartered in some rather small cities—82,000, 60,000, and 34,000 residents, respectively.

61
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:06,320
Therefore, they're regulated by tiny, hyper-competitive local governments.

62
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:10,560
In fact, San Francisco, the city you know best, is not even the largest city in the

63
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:12,640
San Francisco Bay Area.

64
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:19,720
San Jose has 983,000 residents to San Francisco's 815,000 because the entire area is just subdivided

65
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:25,120
into a huge number of smaller cities and towns, which is a bit of a trend.

66
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:29,780
Los Angeles County, encompassing most but not even all of the metro area, is composed

67
00:04:29,780 --> 00:04:33,740
of 88 different cities plus unincorporated areas.

68
00:04:33,740 --> 00:04:38,780
Across both of the state's largest urbanized masses, what functions like one city operates

69
00:04:38,780 --> 00:04:46,100
as dozens, even hundreds, leaving few comprehensive, overarching bodies to align incentives.

70
00:04:46,100 --> 00:04:50,360
Zoomed in, considering the odd relationship and power dynamics of neighboring communities,

71
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:55,120
or zoomed out, considering the state's historical and contemporary isolation, California's

72
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:58,080
as unique a state there is.

73
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:03,320
Uniqueness has brought benefits, but uniqueness has also created unique problems, and bizarre,

74
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:06,400
sometimes convoluted, means of solving them.

75
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:08,400
Take homelessness.

76
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:13,220
This is a hot-button, highly visible issue with complicated causes and largely theoretical

77
00:05:13,220 --> 00:05:17,420
solutions, so it's easy for conversations over it to spiral out of scale.

78
00:05:17,420 --> 00:05:23,260
A quick look at the statistics, however, makes one thing unmistakably clear—California's

79
00:05:23,260 --> 00:05:26,340
homelessness problem is uniquely bad.

80
00:05:26,340 --> 00:05:36,300
Of the 582,462 people experiencing homelessness nationwide in 2022, 171,521 were in California.

81
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:42,360
That's nearly 30% of the nation's total, but for comparison, some 97,000 more than

82
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:49,480
New York and some 150,000 more than Florida—the states with the second and third largest homeless

83
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:50,480
populations.

84
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:53,360
But California is the most populous state in the nation, so this should be considered

85
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:55,440
at a per-resonant rate.

86
00:05:55,440 --> 00:06:00,240
And here, too, California outpaces the rest, with 44 people experiencing homelessness per

87
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:01,700
10,000.

88
00:06:01,700 --> 00:06:06,600
For troubling still, despite the highest total and the highest rate, the problem's only

89
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:08,200
getting worse.

90
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:14,400
From 2020 to 2022, while 23 states saw decreases in their homeless populations, California's

91
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:17,440
rose by another 6%, 10,000 people.

92
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:23,720
So it's a big, bad, and worsening problem, and while it's at the top of meeting agendas

93
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:28,560
from small city halls all the way to Sacramento, it doesn't look like it'll be fixed anytime

94
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:29,560
soon.

95
00:06:29,580 --> 00:06:33,420
While the state has figured out how to solve homelessness, it is generally understood that

96
00:06:33,420 --> 00:06:38,100
providing stable shelters and housing programs is associated with lowering numbers.

97
00:06:38,100 --> 00:06:42,140
It tracks, then, that California has comparatively little in the way of shelter beds, as the

98
00:06:42,140 --> 00:06:46,620
state has instead opted to prioritize permanent housing projects which have proved expensive

99
00:06:46,620 --> 00:06:48,780
and incredibly slow to build.

100
00:06:48,780 --> 00:06:52,140
This has left more and more out in the relative cold.

101
00:06:52,140 --> 00:06:56,860
In 2022, two-thirds of California's homeless were considered unsheltered—living out

102
00:06:56,860 --> 00:07:01,560
of tents, cars, campers, or on the streets, far from shelters and services that could

103
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:03,520
potentially turn things around.

104
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:07,840
Now, the state government has watched this problem grow and spread, and tried to think

105
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:11,640
of solutions while throwing millions upon millions of dollars at it.

106
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:16,360
Yet, the state has the largest, most visible homeless problem in the nation, and has little

107
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:21,140
in the way of solutions, or even stop gaps in place to alleviate the issue.

108
00:07:21,140 --> 00:07:25,140
Much of this is the function of a simple reality that the state government has surprisingly

109
00:07:25,140 --> 00:07:26,440
little control over.

110
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:30,260
It's really hard to build in California.

111
00:07:30,260 --> 00:07:33,540
The difficulty in finding housing extends to everyone here.

112
00:07:33,540 --> 00:07:35,940
The state is in the middle of a housing crisis.

113
00:07:35,940 --> 00:07:39,940
But this isn't because of a faltering economy or meager wages.

114
00:07:39,940 --> 00:07:44,940
California year-in-year-out ranks as one of the highest average income states in the nation,

115
00:07:44,940 --> 00:07:50,140
and yet, in one analysis of 2019 numbers, when adjusted for cost of living, it plummets

116
00:07:50,140 --> 00:07:51,900
to 48th.

117
00:07:51,900 --> 00:07:56,300
Rather than unemployment or low-paying jobs, it's the sky-high cost of living that puts

118
00:07:56,300 --> 00:07:59,560
so many so perilously close to losing a home.

119
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:02,640
All it could take is one medical emergency.

120
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:07,800
Bizarrely, the explanation could be that the state's economy is too strong for its own

121
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:08,800
good.

122
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:13,720
Take this simple metric—the jobs-housing ratio, which considers how many jobs are created

123
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:17,600
in relation to how many units of housing are added to a given area.

124
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:21,680
For local employment to remain healthy, without adding to congestion, traffic, or displacing

125
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:27,420
longtime residents, the US EPA considers a ratio ranging from 0.75 to 1.5 as healthy

126
00:08:27,420 --> 00:08:28,700
for an urban area.

127
00:08:28,700 --> 00:08:33,820
In the last decade, popular cities clearly on the rise have begun to push the upper reaches

128
00:08:33,820 --> 00:08:34,820
of this range.

129
00:08:34,820 --> 00:08:42,060
Phoenix's metro area sits at 1.34, Seattle's 1.43, Austin's 1.47, and Denver's 1.73,

130
00:08:42,060 --> 00:08:46,140
but California has blown the roof off this range.

131
00:08:46,140 --> 00:08:51,040
The LA-Long Beach-Anaheim metro topped 2, Riverside-San Bernardino-Ontario has reached

132
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:56,820
2.72, and the San Jose-Sunnyvale-Santa Clara ratio of new jobs per unit of housing hit

133
00:08:56,820 --> 00:09:01,480
a truly staggering 3.19.

134
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:06,320
Of course, an unrelenting economy only accounts for the numerator here—the jobs.

135
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:10,040
The denominator is just as responsible for the state's housing crisis, but this is

136
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:15,880
the outcome of a concept a bit more nebulous—the California Dream.

137
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:19,880
Of all the floating, intangible assumptions as to what life in California is supposed

138
00:09:19,880 --> 00:09:24,340
to look like—the long, sunny days and pleasant temperatures, along with the plethora of good

139
00:09:24,340 --> 00:09:28,780
jobs, beaches, and open space—it's the single-family home with a lawn and perhaps

140
00:09:28,780 --> 00:09:33,780
a pool that's proved the most important, the most concrete, and currently the most

141
00:09:33,780 --> 00:09:34,780
controversial.

142
00:09:34,780 --> 00:09:38,860
And it's this core tenet that's causing such massive problems.

143
00:09:38,860 --> 00:09:43,020
Californians, after all, desperately want to keep what they were sold on, and they're

144
00:09:43,020 --> 00:09:45,700
willing to fight for it.

145
00:09:45,700 --> 00:09:50,640
Take Atherton, a small Silicon Valley town just minutes away from Stanford.

146
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:55,320
In 2022, to keep up with state mandates on housing requirements, the city council began

147
00:09:55,320 --> 00:10:00,700
the process of rezoning one single-family lot to build an apartment building.

148
00:10:00,700 --> 00:10:02,680
The project was quickly axed.

149
00:10:02,680 --> 00:10:07,600
It wasn't a lack of money or a lack of municipal will—it was axed because the city's most

150
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:12,400
influential, powerful executives and even basketball player Steph Curry banded together

151
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:14,920
and pressured the city out of it.

152
00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:19,220
To them, the project would hurt their property values, cut off their views, change the character

153
00:10:19,220 --> 00:10:24,520
of the community, and create more traffic—so the project, and its 16 units of desperately

154
00:10:24,520 --> 00:10:29,620
needed housing, died on the vine and forced city planners back to the drawing board.

155
00:10:29,620 --> 00:10:33,820
While the characters might not be as high profile as those in Atherton, this happens

156
00:10:33,820 --> 00:10:36,660
all the time all over the state.

157
00:10:36,660 --> 00:10:41,100
Here, the city government decided to designate itself as a mountain lion sanctuary, which

158
00:10:41,100 --> 00:10:45,560
was odd, but conveniently allowed it to forgo new housing development.

159
00:10:45,560 --> 00:10:51,900
Here, in 2019, construction on a 154-bed shelter broke ground, only for Venice Beach to sue

160
00:10:51,900 --> 00:10:54,360
the city of Los Angeles to halt construction.

161
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:59,240
Here, residents of San Francisco's Embarcadero area did the same, suing the city over establishing

162
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:01,640
a 200-bed shelter in the same neighborhood.

163
00:11:01,640 --> 00:11:06,440
And across the larger Bay Area, those who want California to stay the same low-density

164
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:11,020
California of old have created their own organizations, councils, and committees—Better

165
00:11:11,020 --> 00:11:14,580
Cupertino and Palo Alto for Sensible Zoning, to name a few.

166
00:11:14,580 --> 00:11:16,180
This isn't just a fringe.

167
00:11:16,180 --> 00:11:20,660
More and more, anti-density proponents are winning local elections.

168
00:11:20,660 --> 00:11:23,820
All of this is, after all, in the local interest.

169
00:11:23,820 --> 00:11:29,040
If one small town has enough power to push the problem over to the next, clearly a constituency

170
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:32,980
will opt for that over something that could damage their property values.

171
00:11:32,980 --> 00:11:37,060
The state has the money and the interest in solving its problems with homelessness and

172
00:11:37,060 --> 00:11:41,520
housing shortages, but it can only do so much when powerful local governments resist even

173
00:11:41,520 --> 00:11:45,600
the most minor of zoning changes and the smallest of housing projects.

174
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:50,880
So, unexceptional problems have grown to exceptional size, and as the unexceptional solution of

175
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:56,400
simply building more housing gets rejected, the state legislature turns to the spectacular—launching

176
00:11:56,400 --> 00:12:00,820
projects to systematically convert motels into housing units, backing anti-NIMBY laws,

177
00:12:00,820 --> 00:12:04,080
and filing lawsuits against its own cities.

178
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:07,880
And all of this absurd mess is confined to the issue of housing.

179
00:12:07,880 --> 00:12:09,880
There are, of course, fires.

180
00:12:09,880 --> 00:12:13,720
There's also too much water in some places, and too little in others.

181
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:17,800
There's spats about who deserves Colorado River water at the state level and at the

182
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:18,800
local level.

183
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:22,680
There's traffic, there's aging infrastructure, there's companies leaving the state, and

184
00:12:22,680 --> 00:12:24,480
middle-class workers following them.

185
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:28,720
There's a lot of bickering, and a lot to bicker about.

186
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:34,520
Clearly, problems have accumulated in California to an untenable level, and systematically,

187
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:37,380
they aren't getting solved.

188
00:12:37,380 --> 00:12:43,300
Something seems fundamentally wrong with the state, so maybe it needs a fundamental solution.

189
00:12:43,300 --> 00:12:45,320
Maybe California should just be a country.

190
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:47,340
It sounds ludicrous, right?

191
00:12:47,340 --> 00:12:50,100
Of course California can't become a country—it would never happen.

192
00:12:50,100 --> 00:12:51,980
Congress would never allow it.

193
00:12:51,980 --> 00:12:56,580
But perhaps the point worth focusing on is how much less ludicrous it sounds when considering

194
00:12:56,580 --> 00:12:57,820
the argument.

195
00:12:57,820 --> 00:13:01,600
After all, California wouldn't be out of place as a country—it would rank 59th in

196
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:06,800
physical size between Iraq and Paraguay, 38th in population between Canada and Poland,

197
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:12,040
and 5th in GDP between Germany and India—so it'd actually be above average on all major

198
00:13:12,040 --> 00:13:13,800
metrics of scale.

199
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:17,960
One of the common refrains against secession movements is that breakaway regions could

200
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:20,400
not survive economically on their own.

201
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:24,920
For example, according to the UK government, for every dollar Scotland pays in taxes, it

202
00:13:24,920 --> 00:13:28,200
receives about $1.32 back.

203
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:33,780
The country would have an immediate and dramatic budget deficit upon full independence.

204
00:13:33,780 --> 00:13:38,380
This fact undergirds some of the strongest hesitancies among Scots themselves on the

205
00:13:38,380 --> 00:13:39,380
matter.

206
00:13:39,380 --> 00:13:41,020
But California's different.

207
00:13:41,020 --> 00:13:46,780
In 2019, before the pandemic skewed the data, the state received just 97 cents back in federal

208
00:13:46,780 --> 00:13:50,020
spending for every dollar it sent the federal government.

209
00:13:50,020 --> 00:13:54,460
This put the state, each year, in a small camp of around 10 that received less than

210
00:13:54,460 --> 00:13:58,840
what they gave, while others, like Mississippi, Kentucky, and West Virginia, consistently

211
00:13:58,840 --> 00:14:02,520
received more than $2 back for every dollar they sent.

212
00:14:02,520 --> 00:14:05,320
Of course, this is by design.

213
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:09,880
The US's progressive tax system is supposed to take disproportionately from the wealthy

214
00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:14,160
and give disproportionately to the less wealthy, but from California's perspective, many

215
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:18,640
wonder why they're sending all their dollars to unappreciative states thousands of miles

216
00:14:18,640 --> 00:14:19,880
away.

217
00:14:19,880 --> 00:14:24,340
And adding to that, California doesn't even get as much of a say in how those dollars

218
00:14:24,340 --> 00:14:25,740
get spent.

219
00:14:25,740 --> 00:14:30,100
Given the unequal distribution of electoral votes in presidential elections, every individual

220
00:14:30,100 --> 00:14:35,620
in Wyoming has the voting power of about 3.7 Californians, while the Senate system of two

221
00:14:35,620 --> 00:14:40,660
senators per state, regardless of population, further compounds this weak representation.

222
00:14:40,660 --> 00:14:46,140
Again, the system was purposely designed hundreds of years ago to amplify the voices of smaller

223
00:14:46,140 --> 00:14:51,460
states, but from California's perspective, they get the short end of that stick.

224
00:14:51,460 --> 00:14:56,000
Feeling underrepresented by Washington, California has long legislated less like a state and

225
00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:00,800
more like a nation, passing sweeping, powerful laws when it feels like the federal government

226
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:02,000
can't or won't.

227
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:06,320
For example, it's long had a ban on assault rifles, similar to the one that the Biden

228
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:10,320
administration is attempting to pass, it's announced a ban on gas-powered vehicles by

229
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:15,600
2035, similar to other bans passed by countries, it's established its own immigration law,

230
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:18,980
partially focused on educating detainees on their rights prior to handing them over

231
00:15:18,980 --> 00:15:23,400
to what the state might characterize as abusive federal authorities, it's even formed relationships

232
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:28,720
with countries, having signed a joint environmental accord with New Zealand at COP26.

233
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:33,580
In many ways, fixing perceived federal shortcomings has become a central focus of Californian

234
00:15:33,580 --> 00:15:39,560
politics, but unsurprisingly, this dynamic has spurred tensions with DC, especially when

235
00:15:39,560 --> 00:15:42,380
federal power sways towards the right.

236
00:15:42,380 --> 00:15:46,060
There certainly is not the political will for California's secession right now, not

237
00:15:46,060 --> 00:15:51,080
even close, but if there was one big perceived encroachment on California's rights, a knockdown

238
00:15:51,080 --> 00:15:55,560
of their assault rifle ban or a nationwide abortion ban, one could imagine that political

239
00:15:55,560 --> 00:15:57,340
will accumulating quickly.

240
00:15:57,340 --> 00:16:01,920
But it's still a largely moot point, because it would almost certainly be fixing a problem

241
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:04,460
by creating a bigger problem.

242
00:16:04,460 --> 00:16:08,480
As much as California might be held back by sending dollars to Washington or sitting subject

243
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:13,820
to its laws, the state is massively buoyed by its inclusion in the largest economy in

244
00:16:13,820 --> 00:16:14,820
the world.

245
00:16:14,820 --> 00:16:19,620
Removing itself from the US would have dire economic consequences that would surely outweigh

246
00:16:19,620 --> 00:16:21,100
any gain.

247
00:16:21,100 --> 00:16:23,380
Perhaps the closest equivalent is Brexit.

248
00:16:23,380 --> 00:16:27,160
Much of the political will came from a belief that the European Union was taking the country's

249
00:16:27,160 --> 00:16:31,620
money and encroaching on its sovereignty, but now, just a few years on, with mounting

250
00:16:31,620 --> 00:16:36,260
issues on trade and travel, public opinion has shifted decisively towards regret—most

251
00:16:36,260 --> 00:16:42,040
agree that removing the UK from the world's third largest economy was not the right move.

252
00:16:42,040 --> 00:16:46,400
Public opinion on Californian independence has never neared a majority, but there have

253
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:51,040
been enough fringe movement seeking secession that the question has been included in legitimate

254
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:55,920
political polling, reliably demonstrating surprising support for the idea—between

255
00:16:55,920 --> 00:17:00,760
14 and 32% of respondents were for Californian nationhood.

256
00:17:00,760 --> 00:17:06,200
In fact, in one poll run by a Stanford-affiliated think tank, the 18-to-29 demographic responded

257
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:12,540
as 36% for and just 40% against, almost even, demonstrating that, while majority opinion

258
00:17:12,540 --> 00:17:18,380
is not nearly in support of the extreme, unprecedented measure of modern state secession, the perceived

259
00:17:18,380 --> 00:17:24,140
disconnect with Washington has pushed the idea up to surprising levels of legitimacy.

260
00:17:24,140 --> 00:17:29,340
We all know pragmatically that secession will never happen in anything close to this reality,

261
00:17:29,340 --> 00:17:31,700
but partition could.

262
00:17:31,700 --> 00:17:36,800
The underlying idea is the same—that California is big, underrepresented, overtaxed.

263
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:41,360
The solution is just less extreme—split it into smaller states.

264
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:46,180
This has been proposed legitimately over 200 times, and the most recent concerted push

265
00:17:46,180 --> 00:17:49,900
was led by billionaire investor Tim Draper in 2018.

266
00:17:49,900 --> 00:17:53,820
He proposed splitting the state into three parts called Northern California, Southern

267
00:17:53,820 --> 00:17:58,920
California, and California, attempting to balance population, wealth, and politics somewhat

268
00:17:58,920 --> 00:18:00,560
evenly across the three.

269
00:18:00,560 --> 00:18:04,600
The central argument was that the state government was out of touch with local governments given

270
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:08,080
the huge difference in size between the two and that the federal government was out of

271
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:12,400
touch with the state government given the diluted representation, so the solution was

272
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:17,000
to reduce the size of the state and also, given the two senators-per-state system, give

273
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:20,560
more powerful federal representation to the population.

274
00:18:20,560 --> 00:18:26,120
The argument was persuasive enough to generate far more than 367,000 signatures necessary

275
00:18:26,120 --> 00:18:30,560
to put the question on the ballot, but, before election day, it was struck down by the state

276
00:18:30,560 --> 00:18:33,300
supreme court on constitutional grounds.

277
00:18:33,300 --> 00:18:38,560
Even so, it probably wouldn't have passed—polling showed its support between 13 and 17%, but

278
00:18:38,560 --> 00:18:42,140
even if the state did vote for it, it'd then be up to the federal government to approve

279
00:18:42,140 --> 00:18:47,040
such a split, and the federal government would almost certainly never approve a split.

280
00:18:47,040 --> 00:18:51,020
Democrats would balk at the fact that it would fracture a strongly Democratic state, Republicans

281
00:18:51,020 --> 00:18:55,400
would balk at the four additional left-leaning Congresspeople it would send to DC, everyone

282
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:58,720
would ask whether it'd be too dangerous a precedent to establish.

283
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:03,840
So, the big solutions aren't reasonable, and the small solutions aren't working.

284
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:07,120
Perhaps the answer is that California is just too unique.

285
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:10,000
Because it definitely is unique.

286
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:14,920
There is no state, region, or other national subdivision with a larger economy on earth,

287
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:18,640
and going down the list, there aren't really even near equivalents.

288
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:23,120
Texas is number two, but it's run by small government conservatives, meaning state intervention

289
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:24,840
on problems is limited.

290
00:19:24,840 --> 00:19:29,280
New York is number three, but nearly all of its GDP is concentrated in one massive metro

291
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:32,020
area, meaning its structure is far simpler.

292
00:19:32,020 --> 00:19:36,520
You then have England, but it acts as a nation within a nation, then Guangdong and Chengsu,

293
00:19:36,520 --> 00:19:41,040
but China isn't a Democratic state, then Florida, but it has a Texas-style small government

294
00:19:41,040 --> 00:19:46,400
bent, then Chengdong and Sichang, also China, then Illinois, mostly one city, then Henon,

295
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:49,160
also China, then finally Pennsylvania.

296
00:19:49,160 --> 00:19:53,560
With its comparatively conservative, smaller government politics, it's not a great equivalent

297
00:19:53,560 --> 00:19:58,200
to California, but it's the closest so far considering its wealth is somewhat geographically

298
00:19:58,200 --> 00:20:02,520
distributed and its government is more open to intervention than in Florida or Texas.

299
00:20:02,520 --> 00:20:07,720
So that's to say, California is not only unique to the rest of the US, it's unique

300
00:20:07,720 --> 00:20:09,560
to the world.

301
00:20:09,560 --> 00:20:16,520
Truly nobody is trying to manage such a big economy with anything less than nation status.

302
00:20:16,520 --> 00:20:21,160
It has unique problems, it feels disconnected from the nation, it lacks the power of the

303
00:20:21,160 --> 00:20:25,440
nation, and yet it feels like it needs to act like a nation.

304
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:30,440
This should sound familiar, because in 1776, thirteen North American colonies declared

305
00:20:30,440 --> 00:20:34,520
independence from Britain, citing their unique problems, feeling of disconnection, lack of

306
00:20:34,520 --> 00:20:39,960
nation-scale power, and an inkling that just being a nation was a way to fix it all.

307
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:42,720
What happened next was America.

308
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:49,040
What happened after that was American exceptionalism—the belief that the US is fundamentally and dramatically

309
00:20:49,040 --> 00:20:50,500
unique.

310
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:56,740
This is, in many ways, true—there just aren't places that mirror the US's scale, geography,

311
00:20:56,740 --> 00:21:01,540
and demographics, but this feeling undergirds perhaps the most fundamental feature of American

312
00:21:01,540 --> 00:21:07,820
politics—a belief that, as a unique place, the US needs unique solutions.

313
00:21:07,820 --> 00:21:12,900
There is a systematic rejection of solutions that have repeatedly worked in close cultural

314
00:21:12,900 --> 00:21:16,780
equivalence out of a belief that they're incompatible with either what makes America

315
00:21:16,780 --> 00:21:19,340
unique or the uniqueness itself.

316
00:21:19,340 --> 00:21:23,960
So that means that California is the exception to the exception.

317
00:21:23,960 --> 00:21:29,220
The state is exceptional—it is fundamentally different to the rest of the nation, and therefore

318
00:21:29,220 --> 00:21:34,320
an analogous idea of Californian exceptionalism permeates through Sacramento undergirding

319
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:38,160
a belief that they too require unique solutions.

320
00:21:38,160 --> 00:21:42,980
After all, California's supposed to be the land of economic opportunity—a destination

321
00:21:42,980 --> 00:21:47,940
free of persecution, an idyllic antithesis to the status quo.

322
00:21:47,940 --> 00:21:51,940
California is America's America.

323
00:21:51,940 --> 00:21:58,260
The exception to the exception is not the norm—it's something more than the exception.

324
00:21:58,260 --> 00:22:03,100
California is like the hyper-distilled version of America itself, developing for many of

325
00:22:03,100 --> 00:22:07,260
the same reasons as the nation itself, just a century or two on.

326
00:22:07,260 --> 00:22:12,200
It's no wonder that the state centered on rejecting norms from the country centered

327
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:16,160
on rejecting norms might stray from the most obvious path.

328
00:22:16,160 --> 00:22:21,320
It's also no wonder that, in the same way America itself becomes the infatuation of

329
00:22:21,320 --> 00:22:26,900
international media, a source of political entertainment, so too does California to the

330
00:22:26,900 --> 00:22:27,900
US.

331
00:22:27,900 --> 00:22:31,640
At the end of the day, Californian politicians might just be terrible.

332
00:22:31,640 --> 00:22:35,980
The GLP talking points might be right, and the state might be the evidence that liberal

333
00:22:35,980 --> 00:22:40,440
politics are structurally flawed, but it's near impossible to sift through the political

334
00:22:40,440 --> 00:22:44,120
rhetoric and actually objectively analyze this.

335
00:22:44,120 --> 00:22:49,520
However, it's reasonably clear that Californian politicians, like American politicians, have

336
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:54,200
a tougher job to do navigating a truly singular situation.

337
00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:58,480
Decisions are made without precedent, and then in retrospect, with precedent established,

338
00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:00,160
failures seem obvious.

339
00:23:00,160 --> 00:23:04,560
So, the question of how to solve California's problems is more so the question of how to

340
00:23:04,560 --> 00:23:06,860
solve America's problems.

341
00:23:06,860 --> 00:23:11,380
Should it keep trying to find something new, to fight exceptionalism with exceptionalism,

342
00:23:11,380 --> 00:23:17,580
or can unexceptional solutions work for unexceptional problems even when they happen in exceptional

343
00:23:17,580 --> 00:23:19,900
places?

344
00:23:19,900 --> 00:23:23,940
Last year, in a video about carbon offsets, we covered California's unique cap-and-trade

345
00:23:23,940 --> 00:23:27,740
program, which was supposed to be an elegant way to curb industrial emissions, but in practice

346
00:23:27,740 --> 00:23:32,340
propped up ineffective carbon offsets and illogical forest management practices.

347
00:23:32,340 --> 00:23:35,100
This is a classic story in the carbon offsetting world.

348
00:23:35,140 --> 00:23:39,340
It's a concept that works in theory, but regularly fails in practice.

349
00:23:39,340 --> 00:23:43,460
That's because carbon offsets are really only as good as the entity managing them.

350
00:23:43,460 --> 00:23:47,140
That's why I'm so excited to have Wren as a sponsor.

351
00:23:47,140 --> 00:23:51,280
I didn't trust Wren at first—nobody should really trust any carbon offsetting provider

352
00:23:51,280 --> 00:23:55,980
at first, as the industry is ripe with scams—but because they were interested in sponsoring

353
00:23:55,980 --> 00:23:59,820
and were insistent they had found solutions to the problems I highlighted in my video,

354
00:23:59,820 --> 00:24:02,900
I got on a call with them and they walked me through their process.

355
00:24:02,900 --> 00:24:03,900
I left impressed.

356
00:24:03,900 --> 00:24:07,700
I did my absolute best grilling them, but they had thoughtful answers for how they vet

357
00:24:07,700 --> 00:24:09,460
their projects and ensure efficacy.

358
00:24:09,460 --> 00:24:14,020
For example, even the most highly vetted carbon offsetting projects can go wrong when put

359
00:24:14,020 --> 00:24:19,100
into practice, so they counter this by never selling offsets linked to a single project—only

360
00:24:19,100 --> 00:24:23,380
for their portfolio of projects, designed to balance things out so that, if one project

361
00:24:23,380 --> 00:24:26,740
falls through, the others are there to pull the average up.

362
00:24:26,740 --> 00:24:30,260
This also means they can use some of the money to fund more experimental processes, like

363
00:24:30,260 --> 00:24:34,340
mineral weathering, hoping that it can develop into a lower-cost offsetting method in the

364
00:24:34,340 --> 00:24:35,340
future.

365
00:24:35,340 --> 00:24:39,640
I really get the sense that Wren is the real deal—it's run by a small team of dedicated

366
00:24:39,640 --> 00:24:43,700
people passionate about providing an easy way for people to rectify their personal emissions,

367
00:24:43,700 --> 00:24:47,780
so that's why I decided to promote them over every other carbon offsetting provider

368
00:24:47,780 --> 00:24:48,860
that asked.

369
00:24:48,860 --> 00:24:52,940
I use Wren for both my personal and business offsetting because I can trust them to do

370
00:24:52,940 --> 00:24:57,100
everything possible to make sure my money actually leads to carbon offset.
