00:00.000 --> 00:03.340
California is an island.

00:03.340 --> 00:07.780
Not literally, of course, but geography and history has subjected the state to the same

00:07.780 --> 00:12.740
pressures and influences that make actual islands so insular.

00:12.740 --> 00:16.000
Towering mountains separate the bulk of the state from its neighbors, but America's

00:16.000 --> 00:20.600
largest desert places hundreds of miles of harsh, sparsely populated landscape between

00:20.600 --> 00:23.620
it and the more populated states farther east.

00:23.620 --> 00:28.820
Conversely, the largest, richest, and most influential cities in California all sit on

00:28.820 --> 00:33.280
the coast—San Diego, Los Angeles, and San Francisco.

00:33.280 --> 00:35.320
This is no coincidence.

00:35.320 --> 00:40.240
Granted statehood in 1850, California began its interaction with the rest of the nation

00:40.240 --> 00:41.600
by ocean.

00:41.600 --> 00:45.920
It did not border any other state—the next nearest was Texas.

00:45.920 --> 00:50.520
The interior was considered hostile, dangerous wilderness, but also just fundamentally lacked

00:50.520 --> 00:54.980
roads so steamships would leave from the east coast, snake through the Caribbean, and drop

00:54.980 --> 00:56.880
off passengers in Panama.

00:56.880 --> 01:01.000
There, travelers would cross the country by foot and horse and boat to get to Panama

01:01.000 --> 01:04.920
City, where they'd wait for another steamship to bring them to California.

01:04.920 --> 01:10.620
At best a 30- or 40-day trip, but incredibly the fastest way to get from one half of America

01:10.620 --> 01:11.900
to the other.

01:11.900 --> 01:16.240
This disconnect meant California initially operated more like a colony, especially considering

01:16.240 --> 01:20.900
that until telegraph lines spanned the country a decade later, this weeks-long trip was also

01:20.900 --> 01:24.540
the fastest way to get information from coast to coast.

01:24.540 --> 01:30.240
It wasn't until the Transcontinental Railroad was completed in 1869 that the state was truly,

01:30.240 --> 01:34.700
reliably connected to the rest of the country by land, giving California two foundational

01:34.700 --> 01:38.600
decades to define its identity in isolation.

01:38.600 --> 01:44.920
This legacy persists—the disconnect exhibits in small ways that stack up into a meaningful

01:44.920 --> 01:45.920
sum.

01:45.920 --> 01:50.160
For example, most of the rest of the country is linked by a network of oil pipelines, allowing

01:50.160 --> 01:55.120
for cheap and efficient transport of the resource from well to refinery to pump.

01:55.120 --> 01:58.720
California's different—with those towering mountains and desolate deserts separating

01:58.720 --> 02:03.220
it from the east, the economics never worked out to extend the pipeline to the state.

02:03.220 --> 02:07.880
Therefore, California largely buys crude oil from foreign countries, imports it on enormous

02:07.880 --> 02:12.300
tanker ships, and refines it locally which, in addition to the state's strict environmental

02:12.300 --> 02:17.180
regulations, explains the higher prices typically seen at their pumps.

02:17.200 --> 02:21.460
California even has a small degree of disconnect to the rest of the American road network—it's

02:21.460 --> 02:25.580
the only state that requires all travelers to pass through any sort of border formality

02:25.580 --> 02:26.580
when driving in.

02:26.580 --> 02:31.660
It's not immigration per se, rather an agricultural inspection to check for invasive species,

02:31.660 --> 02:35.820
but the point is not that these checks themselves significantly separate the state from the

02:35.820 --> 02:36.880
rest.

02:36.880 --> 02:41.740
More so, the fact that California is able to isolate and protect itself from pests prevalent

02:41.740 --> 02:46.260
in the rest of the country with any degree of success demonstrates just how naturally

02:46.260 --> 02:48.360
disconnected it is.

02:48.360 --> 02:53.600
The only state to have a similarly extensive agricultural inspection system is Hawaii,

02:53.600 --> 02:55.980
made up of literal islands.

02:55.980 --> 03:02.940
But the reason California can be so isolated is because it's really absurdly filthy rich.

03:02.940 --> 03:07.940
The state's center, if defined by wealth concentration, is here—Silicon Valley.

03:07.940 --> 03:13.140
It'd be easy to assume the area's riches are overstated, but the numbers offer a quick

03:13.140 --> 03:14.460
counterpoint.

03:14.460 --> 03:18.980
To Clara, San Mateo, and San Francisco, the three counties that encompass the core of

03:18.980 --> 03:25.960
Silicon Valley, have a collective GDP of $725 billion.

03:25.960 --> 03:32.360
This is closest to that of Poland, the 21st largest nation in the world, home to 38 million

03:32.360 --> 03:33.360
people.

03:33.360 --> 03:37.300
The uninitiated might assume that San Francisco and Silicon Valley are more or less one in

03:37.300 --> 03:38.300
the same.

03:38.300 --> 03:42.120
Sure, San Francisco has a big tech scene, but the major headquarters are distributed

03:42.120 --> 03:46.680
across the towns and cities to the south of it—Google is in Mountain View, Apple

03:46.680 --> 03:49.600
is in Cupertino, Netflix is in Los Gatos.

03:49.600 --> 03:54.280
What this means is that these titans of tech, some of the largest companies in the world,

03:54.280 --> 04:01.200
are headquartered in some rather small cities—82,000, 60,000, and 34,000 residents, respectively.

04:01.200 --> 04:06.320
Therefore, they're regulated by tiny, hyper-competitive local governments.

04:06.320 --> 04:10.560
In fact, San Francisco, the city you know best, is not even the largest city in the

04:10.560 --> 04:12.640
San Francisco Bay Area.

04:12.640 --> 04:19.720
San Jose has 983,000 residents to San Francisco's 815,000 because the entire area is just subdivided

04:19.720 --> 04:25.120
into a huge number of smaller cities and towns, which is a bit of a trend.

04:25.120 --> 04:29.780
Los Angeles County, encompassing most but not even all of the metro area, is composed

04:29.780 --> 04:33.740
of 88 different cities plus unincorporated areas.

04:33.740 --> 04:38.780
Across both of the state's largest urbanized masses, what functions like one city operates

04:38.780 --> 04:46.100
as dozens, even hundreds, leaving few comprehensive, overarching bodies to align incentives.

04:46.100 --> 04:50.360
Zoomed in, considering the odd relationship and power dynamics of neighboring communities,

04:50.360 --> 04:55.120
or zoomed out, considering the state's historical and contemporary isolation, California's

04:55.120 --> 04:58.080
as unique a state there is.

04:58.080 --> 05:03.320
Uniqueness has brought benefits, but uniqueness has also created unique problems, and bizarre,

05:03.320 --> 05:06.400
sometimes convoluted, means of solving them.

05:06.400 --> 05:08.400
Take homelessness.

05:08.400 --> 05:13.220
This is a hot-button, highly visible issue with complicated causes and largely theoretical

05:13.220 --> 05:17.420
solutions, so it's easy for conversations over it to spiral out of scale.

05:17.420 --> 05:23.260
A quick look at the statistics, however, makes one thing unmistakably clear—California's

05:23.260 --> 05:26.340
homelessness problem is uniquely bad.

05:26.340 --> 05:36.300
Of the 582,462 people experiencing homelessness nationwide in 2022, 171,521 were in California.

05:36.840 --> 05:42.360
That's nearly 30% of the nation's total, but for comparison, some 97,000 more than

05:42.360 --> 05:49.480
New York and some 150,000 more than Florida—the states with the second and third largest homeless

05:49.480 --> 05:50.480
populations.

05:50.480 --> 05:53.360
But California is the most populous state in the nation, so this should be considered

05:53.360 --> 05:55.440
at a per-resonant rate.

05:55.440 --> 06:00.240
And here, too, California outpaces the rest, with 44 people experiencing homelessness per

06:00.240 --> 06:01.700
10,000.

06:01.700 --> 06:06.600
For troubling still, despite the highest total and the highest rate, the problem's only

06:06.600 --> 06:08.200
getting worse.

06:08.200 --> 06:14.400
From 2020 to 2022, while 23 states saw decreases in their homeless populations, California's

06:14.400 --> 06:17.440
rose by another 6%, 10,000 people.

06:17.440 --> 06:23.720
So it's a big, bad, and worsening problem, and while it's at the top of meeting agendas

06:23.720 --> 06:28.560
from small city halls all the way to Sacramento, it doesn't look like it'll be fixed anytime

06:28.560 --> 06:29.560
soon.

06:29.580 --> 06:33.420
While the state has figured out how to solve homelessness, it is generally understood that

06:33.420 --> 06:38.100
providing stable shelters and housing programs is associated with lowering numbers.

06:38.100 --> 06:42.140
It tracks, then, that California has comparatively little in the way of shelter beds, as the

06:42.140 --> 06:46.620
state has instead opted to prioritize permanent housing projects which have proved expensive

06:46.620 --> 06:48.780
and incredibly slow to build.

06:48.780 --> 06:52.140
This has left more and more out in the relative cold.

06:52.140 --> 06:56.860
In 2022, two-thirds of California's homeless were considered unsheltered—living out

06:56.860 --> 07:01.560
of tents, cars, campers, or on the streets, far from shelters and services that could

07:01.560 --> 07:03.520
potentially turn things around.

07:03.520 --> 07:07.840
Now, the state government has watched this problem grow and spread, and tried to think

07:07.840 --> 07:11.640
of solutions while throwing millions upon millions of dollars at it.

07:11.640 --> 07:16.360
Yet, the state has the largest, most visible homeless problem in the nation, and has little

07:16.360 --> 07:21.140
in the way of solutions, or even stop gaps in place to alleviate the issue.

07:21.140 --> 07:25.140
Much of this is the function of a simple reality that the state government has surprisingly

07:25.140 --> 07:26.440
little control over.

07:26.520 --> 07:30.260
It's really hard to build in California.

07:30.260 --> 07:33.540
The difficulty in finding housing extends to everyone here.

07:33.540 --> 07:35.940
The state is in the middle of a housing crisis.

07:35.940 --> 07:39.940
But this isn't because of a faltering economy or meager wages.

07:39.940 --> 07:44.940
California year-in-year-out ranks as one of the highest average income states in the nation,

07:44.940 --> 07:50.140
and yet, in one analysis of 2019 numbers, when adjusted for cost of living, it plummets

07:50.140 --> 07:51.900
to 48th.

07:51.900 --> 07:56.300
Rather than unemployment or low-paying jobs, it's the sky-high cost of living that puts

07:56.300 --> 07:59.560
so many so perilously close to losing a home.

07:59.560 --> 08:02.640
All it could take is one medical emergency.

08:02.640 --> 08:07.800
Bizarrely, the explanation could be that the state's economy is too strong for its own

08:07.800 --> 08:08.800
good.

08:08.800 --> 08:13.720
Take this simple metric—the jobs-housing ratio, which considers how many jobs are created

08:13.720 --> 08:17.600
in relation to how many units of housing are added to a given area.

08:17.600 --> 08:21.680
For local employment to remain healthy, without adding to congestion, traffic, or displacing

08:21.680 --> 08:27.420
longtime residents, the US EPA considers a ratio ranging from 0.75 to 1.5 as healthy

08:27.420 --> 08:28.700
for an urban area.

08:28.700 --> 08:33.820
In the last decade, popular cities clearly on the rise have begun to push the upper reaches

08:33.820 --> 08:34.820
of this range.

08:34.820 --> 08:42.060
Phoenix's metro area sits at 1.34, Seattle's 1.43, Austin's 1.47, and Denver's 1.73,

08:42.060 --> 08:46.140
but California has blown the roof off this range.

08:46.140 --> 08:51.040
The LA-Long Beach-Anaheim metro topped 2, Riverside-San Bernardino-Ontario has reached

08:51.040 --> 08:56.820
2.72, and the San Jose-Sunnyvale-Santa Clara ratio of new jobs per unit of housing hit

08:56.820 --> 09:01.480
a truly staggering 3.19.

09:01.480 --> 09:06.320
Of course, an unrelenting economy only accounts for the numerator here—the jobs.

09:06.320 --> 09:10.040
The denominator is just as responsible for the state's housing crisis, but this is

09:10.040 --> 09:15.880
the outcome of a concept a bit more nebulous—the California Dream.

09:15.880 --> 09:19.880
Of all the floating, intangible assumptions as to what life in California is supposed

09:19.880 --> 09:24.340
to look like—the long, sunny days and pleasant temperatures, along with the plethora of good

09:24.340 --> 09:28.780
jobs, beaches, and open space—it's the single-family home with a lawn and perhaps

09:28.780 --> 09:33.780
a pool that's proved the most important, the most concrete, and currently the most

09:33.780 --> 09:34.780
controversial.

09:34.780 --> 09:38.860
And it's this core tenet that's causing such massive problems.

09:38.860 --> 09:43.020
Californians, after all, desperately want to keep what they were sold on, and they're

09:43.020 --> 09:45.700
willing to fight for it.

09:45.700 --> 09:50.640
Take Atherton, a small Silicon Valley town just minutes away from Stanford.

09:50.640 --> 09:55.320
In 2022, to keep up with state mandates on housing requirements, the city council began

09:55.320 --> 10:00.700
the process of rezoning one single-family lot to build an apartment building.

10:00.700 --> 10:02.680
The project was quickly axed.

10:02.680 --> 10:07.600
It wasn't a lack of money or a lack of municipal will—it was axed because the city's most

10:07.600 --> 10:12.400
influential, powerful executives and even basketball player Steph Curry banded together

10:12.400 --> 10:14.920
and pressured the city out of it.

10:14.920 --> 10:19.220
To them, the project would hurt their property values, cut off their views, change the character

10:19.220 --> 10:24.520
of the community, and create more traffic—so the project, and its 16 units of desperately

10:24.520 --> 10:29.620
needed housing, died on the vine and forced city planners back to the drawing board.

10:29.620 --> 10:33.820
While the characters might not be as high profile as those in Atherton, this happens

10:33.820 --> 10:36.660
all the time all over the state.

10:36.660 --> 10:41.100
Here, the city government decided to designate itself as a mountain lion sanctuary, which

10:41.100 --> 10:45.560
was odd, but conveniently allowed it to forgo new housing development.

10:45.560 --> 10:51.900
Here, in 2019, construction on a 154-bed shelter broke ground, only for Venice Beach to sue

10:51.900 --> 10:54.360
the city of Los Angeles to halt construction.

10:54.360 --> 10:59.240
Here, residents of San Francisco's Embarcadero area did the same, suing the city over establishing

10:59.240 --> 11:01.640
a 200-bed shelter in the same neighborhood.

11:01.640 --> 11:06.440
And across the larger Bay Area, those who want California to stay the same low-density

11:06.440 --> 11:11.020
California of old have created their own organizations, councils, and committees—Better

11:11.020 --> 11:14.580
Cupertino and Palo Alto for Sensible Zoning, to name a few.

11:14.580 --> 11:16.180
This isn't just a fringe.

11:16.180 --> 11:20.660
More and more, anti-density proponents are winning local elections.

11:20.660 --> 11:23.820
All of this is, after all, in the local interest.

11:23.820 --> 11:29.040
If one small town has enough power to push the problem over to the next, clearly a constituency

11:29.040 --> 11:32.980
will opt for that over something that could damage their property values.

11:32.980 --> 11:37.060
The state has the money and the interest in solving its problems with homelessness and

11:37.060 --> 11:41.520
housing shortages, but it can only do so much when powerful local governments resist even

11:41.520 --> 11:45.600
the most minor of zoning changes and the smallest of housing projects.

11:45.600 --> 11:50.880
So, unexceptional problems have grown to exceptional size, and as the unexceptional solution of

11:50.880 --> 11:56.400
simply building more housing gets rejected, the state legislature turns to the spectacular—launching

11:56.400 --> 12:00.820
projects to systematically convert motels into housing units, backing anti-NIMBY laws,

12:00.820 --> 12:04.080
and filing lawsuits against its own cities.

12:04.080 --> 12:07.880
And all of this absurd mess is confined to the issue of housing.

12:07.880 --> 12:09.880
There are, of course, fires.

12:09.880 --> 12:13.720
There's also too much water in some places, and too little in others.

12:13.720 --> 12:17.800
There's spats about who deserves Colorado River water at the state level and at the

12:17.800 --> 12:18.800
local level.

12:18.800 --> 12:22.680
There's traffic, there's aging infrastructure, there's companies leaving the state, and

12:22.680 --> 12:24.480
middle-class workers following them.

12:24.480 --> 12:28.720
There's a lot of bickering, and a lot to bicker about.

12:28.720 --> 12:34.520
Clearly, problems have accumulated in California to an untenable level, and systematically,

12:34.520 --> 12:37.380
they aren't getting solved.

12:37.380 --> 12:43.300
Something seems fundamentally wrong with the state, so maybe it needs a fundamental solution.

12:43.300 --> 12:45.320
Maybe California should just be a country.

12:45.320 --> 12:47.340
It sounds ludicrous, right?

12:47.340 --> 12:50.100
Of course California can't become a country—it would never happen.

12:50.100 --> 12:51.980
Congress would never allow it.

12:51.980 --> 12:56.580
But perhaps the point worth focusing on is how much less ludicrous it sounds when considering

12:56.580 --> 12:57.820
the argument.

12:57.820 --> 13:01.600
After all, California wouldn't be out of place as a country—it would rank 59th in

13:01.600 --> 13:06.800
physical size between Iraq and Paraguay, 38th in population between Canada and Poland,

13:06.800 --> 13:12.040
and 5th in GDP between Germany and India—so it'd actually be above average on all major

13:12.040 --> 13:13.800
metrics of scale.

13:13.800 --> 13:17.960
One of the common refrains against secession movements is that breakaway regions could

13:17.960 --> 13:20.400
not survive economically on their own.

13:20.400 --> 13:24.920
For example, according to the UK government, for every dollar Scotland pays in taxes, it

13:24.920 --> 13:28.200
receives about $1.32 back.

13:28.200 --> 13:33.780
The country would have an immediate and dramatic budget deficit upon full independence.

13:33.780 --> 13:38.380
This fact undergirds some of the strongest hesitancies among Scots themselves on the

13:38.380 --> 13:39.380
matter.

13:39.380 --> 13:41.020
But California's different.

13:41.020 --> 13:46.780
In 2019, before the pandemic skewed the data, the state received just 97 cents back in federal

13:46.780 --> 13:50.020
spending for every dollar it sent the federal government.

13:50.020 --> 13:54.460
This put the state, each year, in a small camp of around 10 that received less than

13:54.460 --> 13:58.840
what they gave, while others, like Mississippi, Kentucky, and West Virginia, consistently

13:58.840 --> 14:02.520
received more than $2 back for every dollar they sent.

14:02.520 --> 14:05.320
Of course, this is by design.

14:05.320 --> 14:09.880
The US's progressive tax system is supposed to take disproportionately from the wealthy

14:09.880 --> 14:14.160
and give disproportionately to the less wealthy, but from California's perspective, many

14:14.160 --> 14:18.640
wonder why they're sending all their dollars to unappreciative states thousands of miles

14:18.640 --> 14:19.880
away.

14:19.880 --> 14:24.340
And adding to that, California doesn't even get as much of a say in how those dollars

14:24.340 --> 14:25.740
get spent.

14:25.740 --> 14:30.100
Given the unequal distribution of electoral votes in presidential elections, every individual

14:30.100 --> 14:35.620
in Wyoming has the voting power of about 3.7 Californians, while the Senate system of two

14:35.620 --> 14:40.660
senators per state, regardless of population, further compounds this weak representation.

14:40.660 --> 14:46.140
Again, the system was purposely designed hundreds of years ago to amplify the voices of smaller

14:46.140 --> 14:51.460
states, but from California's perspective, they get the short end of that stick.

14:51.460 --> 14:56.000
Feeling underrepresented by Washington, California has long legislated less like a state and

14:56.000 --> 15:00.800
more like a nation, passing sweeping, powerful laws when it feels like the federal government

15:00.800 --> 15:02.000
can't or won't.

15:02.000 --> 15:06.320
For example, it's long had a ban on assault rifles, similar to the one that the Biden

15:06.320 --> 15:10.320
administration is attempting to pass, it's announced a ban on gas-powered vehicles by

15:10.320 --> 15:15.600
2035, similar to other bans passed by countries, it's established its own immigration law,

15:15.600 --> 15:18.980
partially focused on educating detainees on their rights prior to handing them over

15:18.980 --> 15:23.400
to what the state might characterize as abusive federal authorities, it's even formed relationships

15:23.400 --> 15:28.720
with countries, having signed a joint environmental accord with New Zealand at COP26.

15:28.720 --> 15:33.580
In many ways, fixing perceived federal shortcomings has become a central focus of Californian

15:33.580 --> 15:39.560
politics, but unsurprisingly, this dynamic has spurred tensions with DC, especially when

15:39.560 --> 15:42.380
federal power sways towards the right.

15:42.380 --> 15:46.060
There certainly is not the political will for California's secession right now, not

15:46.060 --> 15:51.080
even close, but if there was one big perceived encroachment on California's rights, a knockdown

15:51.080 --> 15:55.560
of their assault rifle ban or a nationwide abortion ban, one could imagine that political

15:55.560 --> 15:57.340
will accumulating quickly.

15:57.340 --> 16:01.920
But it's still a largely moot point, because it would almost certainly be fixing a problem

16:01.920 --> 16:04.460
by creating a bigger problem.

16:04.460 --> 16:08.480
As much as California might be held back by sending dollars to Washington or sitting subject

16:08.480 --> 16:13.820
to its laws, the state is massively buoyed by its inclusion in the largest economy in

16:13.820 --> 16:14.820
the world.

16:14.820 --> 16:19.620
Removing itself from the US would have dire economic consequences that would surely outweigh

16:19.620 --> 16:21.100
any gain.

16:21.100 --> 16:23.380
Perhaps the closest equivalent is Brexit.

16:23.380 --> 16:27.160
Much of the political will came from a belief that the European Union was taking the country's

16:27.160 --> 16:31.620
money and encroaching on its sovereignty, but now, just a few years on, with mounting

16:31.620 --> 16:36.260
issues on trade and travel, public opinion has shifted decisively towards regret—most

16:36.260 --> 16:42.040
agree that removing the UK from the world's third largest economy was not the right move.

16:42.040 --> 16:46.400
Public opinion on Californian independence has never neared a majority, but there have

16:46.400 --> 16:51.040
been enough fringe movement seeking secession that the question has been included in legitimate

16:51.040 --> 16:55.920
political polling, reliably demonstrating surprising support for the idea—between

16:55.920 --> 17:00.760
14 and 32% of respondents were for Californian nationhood.

17:00.760 --> 17:06.200
In fact, in one poll run by a Stanford-affiliated think tank, the 18-to-29 demographic responded

17:06.200 --> 17:12.540
as 36% for and just 40% against, almost even, demonstrating that, while majority opinion

17:12.540 --> 17:18.380
is not nearly in support of the extreme, unprecedented measure of modern state secession, the perceived

17:18.380 --> 17:24.140
disconnect with Washington has pushed the idea up to surprising levels of legitimacy.

17:24.140 --> 17:29.340
We all know pragmatically that secession will never happen in anything close to this reality,

17:29.340 --> 17:31.700
but partition could.

17:31.700 --> 17:36.800
The underlying idea is the same—that California is big, underrepresented, overtaxed.

17:36.800 --> 17:41.360
The solution is just less extreme—split it into smaller states.

17:41.360 --> 17:46.180
This has been proposed legitimately over 200 times, and the most recent concerted push

17:46.180 --> 17:49.900
was led by billionaire investor Tim Draper in 2018.

17:49.900 --> 17:53.820
He proposed splitting the state into three parts called Northern California, Southern

17:53.820 --> 17:58.920
California, and California, attempting to balance population, wealth, and politics somewhat

17:58.920 --> 18:00.560
evenly across the three.

18:00.560 --> 18:04.600
The central argument was that the state government was out of touch with local governments given

18:04.600 --> 18:08.080
the huge difference in size between the two and that the federal government was out of

18:08.080 --> 18:12.400
touch with the state government given the diluted representation, so the solution was

18:12.400 --> 18:17.000
to reduce the size of the state and also, given the two senators-per-state system, give

18:17.000 --> 18:20.560
more powerful federal representation to the population.

18:20.560 --> 18:26.120
The argument was persuasive enough to generate far more than 367,000 signatures necessary

18:26.120 --> 18:30.560
to put the question on the ballot, but, before election day, it was struck down by the state

18:30.560 --> 18:33.300
supreme court on constitutional grounds.

18:33.300 --> 18:38.560
Even so, it probably wouldn't have passed—polling showed its support between 13 and 17%, but

18:38.560 --> 18:42.140
even if the state did vote for it, it'd then be up to the federal government to approve

18:42.140 --> 18:47.040
such a split, and the federal government would almost certainly never approve a split.

18:47.040 --> 18:51.020
Democrats would balk at the fact that it would fracture a strongly Democratic state, Republicans

18:51.020 --> 18:55.400
would balk at the four additional left-leaning Congresspeople it would send to DC, everyone

18:55.400 --> 18:58.720
would ask whether it'd be too dangerous a precedent to establish.

18:58.720 --> 19:03.840
So, the big solutions aren't reasonable, and the small solutions aren't working.

19:03.840 --> 19:07.120
Perhaps the answer is that California is just too unique.

19:07.120 --> 19:10.000
Because it definitely is unique.

19:10.000 --> 19:14.920
There is no state, region, or other national subdivision with a larger economy on earth,

19:14.920 --> 19:18.640
and going down the list, there aren't really even near equivalents.

19:18.640 --> 19:23.120
Texas is number two, but it's run by small government conservatives, meaning state intervention

19:23.120 --> 19:24.840
on problems is limited.

19:24.840 --> 19:29.280
New York is number three, but nearly all of its GDP is concentrated in one massive metro

19:29.280 --> 19:32.020
area, meaning its structure is far simpler.

19:32.020 --> 19:36.520
You then have England, but it acts as a nation within a nation, then Guangdong and Chengsu,

19:36.520 --> 19:41.040
but China isn't a Democratic state, then Florida, but it has a Texas-style small government

19:41.040 --> 19:46.400
bent, then Chengdong and Sichang, also China, then Illinois, mostly one city, then Henon,

19:46.400 --> 19:49.160
also China, then finally Pennsylvania.

19:49.160 --> 19:53.560
With its comparatively conservative, smaller government politics, it's not a great equivalent

19:53.560 --> 19:58.200
to California, but it's the closest so far considering its wealth is somewhat geographically

19:58.200 --> 20:02.520
distributed and its government is more open to intervention than in Florida or Texas.

20:02.520 --> 20:07.720
So that's to say, California is not only unique to the rest of the US, it's unique

20:07.720 --> 20:09.560
to the world.

20:09.560 --> 20:16.520
Truly nobody is trying to manage such a big economy with anything less than nation status.

20:16.520 --> 20:21.160
It has unique problems, it feels disconnected from the nation, it lacks the power of the

20:21.160 --> 20:25.440
nation, and yet it feels like it needs to act like a nation.

20:25.440 --> 20:30.440
This should sound familiar, because in 1776, thirteen North American colonies declared

20:30.440 --> 20:34.520
independence from Britain, citing their unique problems, feeling of disconnection, lack of

20:34.520 --> 20:39.960
nation-scale power, and an inkling that just being a nation was a way to fix it all.

20:39.960 --> 20:42.720
What happened next was America.

20:42.720 --> 20:49.040
What happened after that was American exceptionalism—the belief that the US is fundamentally and dramatically

20:49.040 --> 20:50.500
unique.

20:50.500 --> 20:56.740
This is, in many ways, true—there just aren't places that mirror the US's scale, geography,

20:56.740 --> 21:01.540
and demographics, but this feeling undergirds perhaps the most fundamental feature of American

21:01.540 --> 21:07.820
politics—a belief that, as a unique place, the US needs unique solutions.

21:07.820 --> 21:12.900
There is a systematic rejection of solutions that have repeatedly worked in close cultural

21:12.900 --> 21:16.780
equivalence out of a belief that they're incompatible with either what makes America

21:16.780 --> 21:19.340
unique or the uniqueness itself.

21:19.340 --> 21:23.960
So that means that California is the exception to the exception.

21:23.960 --> 21:29.220
The state is exceptional—it is fundamentally different to the rest of the nation, and therefore

21:29.220 --> 21:34.320
an analogous idea of Californian exceptionalism permeates through Sacramento undergirding

21:34.320 --> 21:38.160
a belief that they too require unique solutions.

21:38.160 --> 21:42.980
After all, California's supposed to be the land of economic opportunity—a destination

21:42.980 --> 21:47.940
free of persecution, an idyllic antithesis to the status quo.

21:47.940 --> 21:51.940
California is America's America.

21:51.940 --> 21:58.260
The exception to the exception is not the norm—it's something more than the exception.

21:58.260 --> 22:03.100
California is like the hyper-distilled version of America itself, developing for many of

22:03.100 --> 22:07.260
the same reasons as the nation itself, just a century or two on.

22:07.260 --> 22:12.200
It's no wonder that the state centered on rejecting norms from the country centered

22:12.200 --> 22:16.160
on rejecting norms might stray from the most obvious path.

22:16.160 --> 22:21.320
It's also no wonder that, in the same way America itself becomes the infatuation of

22:21.320 --> 22:26.900
international media, a source of political entertainment, so too does California to the

22:26.900 --> 22:27.900
US.

22:27.900 --> 22:31.640
At the end of the day, Californian politicians might just be terrible.

22:31.640 --> 22:35.980
The GLP talking points might be right, and the state might be the evidence that liberal

22:35.980 --> 22:40.440
politics are structurally flawed, but it's near impossible to sift through the political

22:40.440 --> 22:44.120
rhetoric and actually objectively analyze this.

22:44.120 --> 22:49.520
However, it's reasonably clear that Californian politicians, like American politicians, have

22:49.520 --> 22:54.200
a tougher job to do navigating a truly singular situation.

22:54.200 --> 22:58.480
Decisions are made without precedent, and then in retrospect, with precedent established,

22:58.480 --> 23:00.160
failures seem obvious.

23:00.160 --> 23:04.560
So, the question of how to solve California's problems is more so the question of how to

23:04.560 --> 23:06.860
solve America's problems.

23:06.860 --> 23:11.380
Should it keep trying to find something new, to fight exceptionalism with exceptionalism,

23:11.380 --> 23:17.580
or can unexceptional solutions work for unexceptional problems even when they happen in exceptional

23:17.580 --> 23:19.900
places?

23:19.900 --> 23:23.940
Last year, in a video about carbon offsets, we covered California's unique cap-and-trade

23:23.940 --> 23:27.740
program, which was supposed to be an elegant way to curb industrial emissions, but in practice

23:27.740 --> 23:32.340
propped up ineffective carbon offsets and illogical forest management practices.

23:32.340 --> 23:35.100
This is a classic story in the carbon offsetting world.

23:35.140 --> 23:39.340
It's a concept that works in theory, but regularly fails in practice.

23:39.340 --> 23:43.460
That's because carbon offsets are really only as good as the entity managing them.

23:43.460 --> 23:47.140
That's why I'm so excited to have Wren as a sponsor.

23:47.140 --> 23:51.280
I didn't trust Wren at first—nobody should really trust any carbon offsetting provider

23:51.280 --> 23:55.980
at first, as the industry is ripe with scams—but because they were interested in sponsoring

23:55.980 --> 23:59.820
and were insistent they had found solutions to the problems I highlighted in my video,

23:59.820 --> 24:02.900
I got on a call with them and they walked me through their process.

24:02.900 --> 24:03.900
I left impressed.

24:03.900 --> 24:07.700
I did my absolute best grilling them, but they had thoughtful answers for how they vet

24:07.700 --> 24:09.460
their projects and ensure efficacy.

24:09.460 --> 24:14.020
For example, even the most highly vetted carbon offsetting projects can go wrong when put

24:14.020 --> 24:19.100
into practice, so they counter this by never selling offsets linked to a single project—only

24:19.100 --> 24:23.380
for their portfolio of projects, designed to balance things out so that, if one project

24:23.380 --> 24:26.740
falls through, the others are there to pull the average up.

24:26.740 --> 24:30.260
This also means they can use some of the money to fund more experimental processes, like

24:30.260 --> 24:34.340
mineral weathering, hoping that it can develop into a lower-cost offsetting method in the

24:34.340 --> 24:35.340
future.

24:35.340 --> 24:39.640
I really get the sense that Wren is the real deal—it's run by a small team of dedicated

24:39.640 --> 24:43.700
people passionate about providing an easy way for people to rectify their personal emissions,

24:43.700 --> 24:47.780
so that's why I decided to promote them over every other carbon offsetting provider

24:47.780 --> 24:48.860
that asked.

24:48.860 --> 24:52.940
I use Wren for both my personal and business offsetting because I can trust them to do

24:52.940 --> 24:57.100
everything possible to make sure my money actually leads to carbon offset.
