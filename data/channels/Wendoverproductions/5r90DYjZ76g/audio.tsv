10920	14960	If you were just dropped in this place, with no prior knowledge, where would you guess
14960	16160	you were?
16160	22520	Maybe Florida or California or Hawaii, somewhere tropical, but this is definitely the US.
22520	24680	It just looks like the US.
24680	28860	From the style of signs to the way the roads look to the stores that line the streets,
28860	33860	you can tell it's the US, but it's not Florida, it's not California, it's not
33860	37460	Hawaii, it's not even on this side of the world.
37460	41800	It's America's most isolated territory—it's Guam.
41800	47700	The United States has five inhabited territories—the US Virgin Islands, Puerto Rico, American Samoa,
47700	50380	the Northern Mariana Islands, and Guam itself.
50380	55540	Guam is the furthest of these five from the continental US—nearly 8,000 miles away from
55540	58780	Washington DC, making it the most isolated.
58780	65060	Beijing, Delhi, Cape Town, and Buenos Aires are all closer to DC than Guam is and yet
65060	68860	the island is a fully fledged territory of the US.
68860	70660	It is the US.
70660	75500	Guam has been inhabited for thousands of years by the native Chamorro people until the 1500s
75500	78180	when it was first claimed as a territory by Spain.
78180	82100	Centuries later, after the US' victory in the Spanish-American War, the territory was
82100	85620	ceded to the United States along with Puerto Rico and the Philippines.
85620	90100	Aside from a brief and brutal Japanese occupation during World War II, the island has remained
90100	92340	part of the US ever since.
92340	96800	Many Americans had never even heard of Guam until summer 2017.
96800	100780	That was when North Korean leader Kim Jong-un threatened to launch a ballistic missile at
100780	101780	Guam.
101780	106100	The threats may have since subsided, but the effects of that summer have not.
106100	109860	The island stretches less than 30 miles from top to bottom which makes it smaller than
109860	115660	every other US state and territory and yet it packs more than 160,000 people into that
115660	116660	small size.
116660	122020	In fact, it's more densely populated than all but five US states or territories.
122020	126480	Meanwhile, it is by far the most developed place in Micronesia.
126480	130800	To put it in perspective, Guam's neighboring islands, the Northern Mariana Islands, which
130800	139620	are also part of the US, have a GDP per capita of $16,800 while Guam's is more than $35,000.
139620	146660	Chiribati, meanwhile, the most populous country in Micronesia, has a GDP per capita of $1,500.
146660	151580	Guam is an outpost of the modern developed world in one of the poorest regions of the
151580	152580	world.
152580	154940	Its location, though, is its greatest asset.
154940	158260	Its economy exists because of where it is.
158260	162820	The island is three hours from Tokyo, four hours from Seoul, and five hours from Hong
162820	163820	Kong.
163820	167740	It's close to Asia, but it is still the US—unequivocally.
167740	172700	You see American license plates, American-style ambulances, they have US post offices, they
172700	178660	use the US dollar, they have American stores, American hotels, US national parks, US airlines,
178660	184020	there is no compromise on the American-ness of Guam because it is the US.
184020	188060	They fly the US flag and for tourists, this is a draw.
188060	192260	Instead of flying seven hours to Hawaii or ten hours to California, Japanese tourists
192260	196660	can and do just fly three hours to Guam in order to visit the US.
196660	201100	The malls, which look identical to any in Virginia, or Kansas, or anywhere else in the
201100	205980	US, are hugely popular with Asian tourists as they can buy American goods for a fraction
205980	207820	of what they would cost in Asia.
207820	213660	About 1.5 million people visit the island of 160,000 each year, but what's not good
213660	215820	for tourism is missile threats.
216380	226420	Last summer when they were playing Whose Missiles Bigger, we were the ones that suffered.
226420	231020	Our tourism took a huge nosedive that month of August.
231020	237740	We never saw so many news agencies come into Guam from countries that didn't even realize
237740	244700	we existed because all of a sudden Kim Jong-un was threatening the American territory in
244700	245800	the Pacific.
245800	249060	This is Benjamin Cruz, speaker of the Guam legislature.
249060	253780	As he said, the island's economy suffered immensely from the North Korean missile threat.
253780	257840	Many visitors of Guam come as part of school groups or corporate retreats and these groups
257840	261200	in particular almost universally cancelled their trips.
261200	268560	We lost, I mean almost our entire, I mean all of Japan stopped coming.
268560	270360	I mean everybody was afraid to come.
270360	273880	The only ones that were coming were the news media.
273880	278400	Fortunately, the effects were partially mitigated by an increase in visitors from South Korea
278400	281500	who were less worried about missile threats since it's a reality they live with every
281500	287060	day back home, but for an island so centered around tourism, being dragged into politics
287060	288600	is never good.
288600	292860	Despite being part of the US, though, Guam functions politically differently from every
292860	294600	other part of the US.
294600	299080	Benjamin Cruz, along with the 14 other senators, are the lawmakers of Guam.
299080	303500	They can legislate just like any state legislator but the main political difference for Guam
303500	304900	is at the federal level.
304900	309400	All the US federal laws, the ones made in Washington for the whole country, all those
309400	311100	laws apply in Guam.
311100	314180	What Guam doesn't get, though, is a vote.
314180	318140	Their congressional representatives don't get a vote so by extension, the people of
318140	321420	Guam can't vote on the laws that apply to them.
321420	326300	In addition, unlike Washington DC, which also doesn't receive a vote in Congress, Guam,
326300	331020	along with the other US territories, is not able to vote for their president—the US
331020	332020	president.
332020	335720	This represents an issue not only because of the lapse in democracy, but also because
335720	341160	many US laws that may make sense for the continental United States just don't for a territory
341160	342960	on the other side of the world.
342960	351760	We'd like to be able to invite people to the island and industries and not have to
351760	356960	worry about whether or not the SEC would approve it or the FCC would approve it.
356960	363860	We'd like to be able to have control over our skies so we can invite airlines to fly
363860	370060	in without having to clear with FAA on whether or not this airline or that airline can or
370060	371840	cannot fly.
371840	376140	The process for a foreign airline of gaining approval to fly to the US is often long and
376140	380260	laborious and there are a number of special security and immigration rules for flights
380260	381260	to the US.
381260	385600	This isn't a problem for large intercontinental airlines or Mexican or Canadian ones for whom
385600	389660	flights to the US represent a large part of their market, but for small, regional Asian
389660	395140	carriers, they might pass on flights to Guam just to avoid having to gain FAA approval.
395140	397640	Another issue for Guam is the Jones Act.
397640	402140	This law prevents foreign-built, owned, or operated ships from carrying cargo or passengers
402140	403960	between US ports.
403960	407400	This may make sense within the continental United States, just as you wouldn't want
407400	411360	a foreign airline flying domestic cargo routes, you wouldn't want a foreign shipping company
411360	415940	taking over cargo routes like Houston to Charleston or Seattle to Oakland, but Guam
415940	417580	is a different story.
417580	421480	Cargo ships generally make many stops along their routes so it would be perfectly normal
421480	427520	for a Taiwanese ship, for example, to go from Oakland to Hawaii to Guam to Osaka to Taipei,
427520	431680	but it can't because then it'd be transporting goods between US ports.
431680	436300	Instead, only US ships can bring goods from the US, where most of Guam's goods come
436300	438360	from, to Guam.
438360	442280	Other US territories like American Samoa and the Northern Mariana Islands are exempt from
442280	447600	this rule but Guam is still subject to it which makes shipping to the island more expensive.
447600	452100	Despite the issues the US federal government may cause, the people of Guam are in no hurry
452100	453960	to distance themselves from it.
453960	461640	I think if you were to ask a majority of the people on the island, they would like to have
461640	467560	a closer union with the United States and some may even want statehood.
467560	472280	I mean, in fact, a majority of them would love to see statehood.
472280	476700	In many ways, Guam is one of the most patriotic areas of the US.
476700	481700	The US military freed Guam from a brutal and deadly Japanese occupation during World War
481700	484720	II which many of the older residents still remember.
484720	488880	The younger residents, meanwhile, quite often work for the US.
488880	494160	Just about every family on this island, I'm sure almost every family on this island, had
494160	497840	at least one member of their family serve in the military.
497840	502680	One out of eight residents of Guam serve or have served in the US armed forces.
502680	508000	It has a higher enlistment rate than any US state, but this is helped by the fact that
508000	511380	a quarter of the island is US military bases.
511380	515180	The island is one of the US military's most strategic assets.
515180	520240	Of course the US has plenty of bases in Japan and South Korea, but Guam is US soil less
520240	525040	than four hours away from North Korea, the East China Sea, and the South China Sea—all
525040	527240	possible flashpoints for US conflict.
527240	533040	The US military is the single largest employer on Guam and its economy depends on the military.
533040	536660	While tourism may have suffered recently, the military business is good.
536660	540520	The number of military personnel stationed on Guam is slated to more than double in the
540520	543640	coming decade which will no doubt stimulate the economy.
543640	548560	This doesn't come without concern—Guam only has so much land—but all factors considered,
548960	550640	Guam is on the rise.
550640	552760	Guam is truly a unique place.
552760	556840	Plenty of countries have territories far away from their mainland, but few are as developed
556840	559600	and similar to the rest of the country as Guam.
559600	564480	If Guam was just off the coast of the US mainland it would be totally unremarkable—just another
564480	569080	piece of the US that looks and acts like the rest of the US, but it's not—it's on
569080	571080	the other side of the world.
571080	575040	Guam is a relic of colonialism that today is a thriving, developed place.
575040	580560	It may not get treated like the US, even by its own government, but in all other ways,
580560	582960	Guam is the United States.
582960	586000	One aspect of Guam's story that this video didn't cover is how they're trying to
586000	590560	grow their local, small businesses in order to make the economy more self-sustaining.
590560	592620	Squarespace also helps with this.

597560	600240	beautifully designed, professional-looking website.
