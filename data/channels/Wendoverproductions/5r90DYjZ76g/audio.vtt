If you were just dropped in this place, with no prior knowledge, where would you guess

00:14.960 --> 00:16.160
you were?

00:16.160 --> 00:22.520
Maybe Florida or California or Hawaii, somewhere tropical, but this is definitely the US.

00:22.520 --> 00:24.680
It just looks like the US.

00:24.680 --> 00:28.860
From the style of signs to the way the roads look to the stores that line the streets,

00:28.860 --> 00:33.860
you can tell it's the US, but it's not Florida, it's not California, it's not

00:33.860 --> 00:37.460
Hawaii, it's not even on this side of the world.

00:37.460 --> 00:41.800
It's America's most isolated territory—it's Guam.

00:41.800 --> 00:47.700
The United States has five inhabited territories—the US Virgin Islands, Puerto Rico, American Samoa,

00:47.700 --> 00:50.380
the Northern Mariana Islands, and Guam itself.

00:50.380 --> 00:55.540
Guam is the furthest of these five from the continental US—nearly 8,000 miles away from

00:55.540 --> 00:58.780
Washington DC, making it the most isolated.

00:58.780 --> 01:05.060
Beijing, Delhi, Cape Town, and Buenos Aires are all closer to DC than Guam is and yet

01:05.060 --> 01:08.860
the island is a fully fledged territory of the US.

01:08.860 --> 01:10.660
It is the US.

01:10.660 --> 01:15.500
Guam has been inhabited for thousands of years by the native Chamorro people until the 1500s

01:15.500 --> 01:18.180
when it was first claimed as a territory by Spain.

01:18.180 --> 01:22.100
Centuries later, after the US' victory in the Spanish-American War, the territory was

01:22.100 --> 01:25.620
ceded to the United States along with Puerto Rico and the Philippines.

01:25.620 --> 01:30.100
Aside from a brief and brutal Japanese occupation during World War II, the island has remained

01:30.100 --> 01:32.340
part of the US ever since.

01:32.340 --> 01:36.800
Many Americans had never even heard of Guam until summer 2017.

01:36.800 --> 01:40.780
That was when North Korean leader Kim Jong-un threatened to launch a ballistic missile at

01:40.780 --> 01:41.780
Guam.

01:41.780 --> 01:46.100
The threats may have since subsided, but the effects of that summer have not.

01:46.100 --> 01:49.860
The island stretches less than 30 miles from top to bottom which makes it smaller than

01:49.860 --> 01:55.660
every other US state and territory and yet it packs more than 160,000 people into that

01:55.660 --> 01:56.660
small size.

01:56.660 --> 02:02.020
In fact, it's more densely populated than all but five US states or territories.

02:02.020 --> 02:06.480
Meanwhile, it is by far the most developed place in Micronesia.

02:06.480 --> 02:10.800
To put it in perspective, Guam's neighboring islands, the Northern Mariana Islands, which

02:10.800 --> 02:19.620
are also part of the US, have a GDP per capita of $16,800 while Guam's is more than $35,000.

02:19.620 --> 02:26.660
Chiribati, meanwhile, the most populous country in Micronesia, has a GDP per capita of $1,500.

02:26.660 --> 02:31.580
Guam is an outpost of the modern developed world in one of the poorest regions of the

02:31.580 --> 02:32.580
world.

02:32.580 --> 02:34.940
Its location, though, is its greatest asset.

02:34.940 --> 02:38.260
Its economy exists because of where it is.

02:38.260 --> 02:42.820
The island is three hours from Tokyo, four hours from Seoul, and five hours from Hong

02:42.820 --> 02:43.820
Kong.

02:43.820 --> 02:47.740
It's close to Asia, but it is still the US—unequivocally.

02:47.740 --> 02:52.700
You see American license plates, American-style ambulances, they have US post offices, they

02:52.700 --> 02:58.660
use the US dollar, they have American stores, American hotels, US national parks, US airlines,

02:58.660 --> 03:04.020
there is no compromise on the American-ness of Guam because it is the US.

03:04.020 --> 03:08.060
They fly the US flag and for tourists, this is a draw.

03:08.060 --> 03:12.260
Instead of flying seven hours to Hawaii or ten hours to California, Japanese tourists

03:12.260 --> 03:16.660
can and do just fly three hours to Guam in order to visit the US.

03:16.660 --> 03:21.100
The malls, which look identical to any in Virginia, or Kansas, or anywhere else in the

03:21.100 --> 03:25.980
US, are hugely popular with Asian tourists as they can buy American goods for a fraction

03:25.980 --> 03:27.820
of what they would cost in Asia.

03:27.820 --> 03:33.660
About 1.5 million people visit the island of 160,000 each year, but what's not good

03:33.660 --> 03:35.820
for tourism is missile threats.

03:36.380 --> 03:46.420
Last summer when they were playing Whose Missiles Bigger, we were the ones that suffered.

03:46.420 --> 03:51.020
Our tourism took a huge nosedive that month of August.

03:51.020 --> 03:57.740
We never saw so many news agencies come into Guam from countries that didn't even realize

03:57.740 --> 04:04.700
we existed because all of a sudden Kim Jong-un was threatening the American territory in

04:04.700 --> 04:05.800
the Pacific.

04:05.800 --> 04:09.060
This is Benjamin Cruz, speaker of the Guam legislature.

04:09.060 --> 04:13.780
As he said, the island's economy suffered immensely from the North Korean missile threat.

04:13.780 --> 04:17.840
Many visitors of Guam come as part of school groups or corporate retreats and these groups

04:17.840 --> 04:21.200
in particular almost universally cancelled their trips.

04:21.200 --> 04:28.560
We lost, I mean almost our entire, I mean all of Japan stopped coming.

04:28.560 --> 04:30.360
I mean everybody was afraid to come.

04:30.360 --> 04:33.880
The only ones that were coming were the news media.

04:33.880 --> 04:38.400
Fortunately, the effects were partially mitigated by an increase in visitors from South Korea

04:38.400 --> 04:41.500
who were less worried about missile threats since it's a reality they live with every

04:41.500 --> 04:47.060
day back home, but for an island so centered around tourism, being dragged into politics

04:47.060 --> 04:48.600
is never good.

04:48.600 --> 04:52.860
Despite being part of the US, though, Guam functions politically differently from every

04:52.860 --> 04:54.600
other part of the US.

04:54.600 --> 04:59.080
Benjamin Cruz, along with the 14 other senators, are the lawmakers of Guam.

04:59.080 --> 05:03.500
They can legislate just like any state legislator but the main political difference for Guam

05:03.500 --> 05:04.900
is at the federal level.

05:04.900 --> 05:09.400
All the US federal laws, the ones made in Washington for the whole country, all those

05:09.400 --> 05:11.100
laws apply in Guam.

05:11.100 --> 05:14.180
What Guam doesn't get, though, is a vote.

05:14.180 --> 05:18.140
Their congressional representatives don't get a vote so by extension, the people of

05:18.140 --> 05:21.420
Guam can't vote on the laws that apply to them.

05:21.420 --> 05:26.300
In addition, unlike Washington DC, which also doesn't receive a vote in Congress, Guam,

05:26.300 --> 05:31.020
along with the other US territories, is not able to vote for their president—the US

05:31.020 --> 05:32.020
president.

05:32.020 --> 05:35.720
This represents an issue not only because of the lapse in democracy, but also because

05:35.720 --> 05:41.160
many US laws that may make sense for the continental United States just don't for a territory

05:41.160 --> 05:42.960
on the other side of the world.

05:42.960 --> 05:51.760
We'd like to be able to invite people to the island and industries and not have to

05:51.760 --> 05:56.960
worry about whether or not the SEC would approve it or the FCC would approve it.

05:56.960 --> 06:03.860
We'd like to be able to have control over our skies so we can invite airlines to fly

06:03.860 --> 06:10.060
in without having to clear with FAA on whether or not this airline or that airline can or

06:10.060 --> 06:11.840
cannot fly.

06:11.840 --> 06:16.140
The process for a foreign airline of gaining approval to fly to the US is often long and

06:16.140 --> 06:20.260
laborious and there are a number of special security and immigration rules for flights

06:20.260 --> 06:21.260
to the US.

06:21.260 --> 06:25.600
This isn't a problem for large intercontinental airlines or Mexican or Canadian ones for whom

06:25.600 --> 06:29.660
flights to the US represent a large part of their market, but for small, regional Asian

06:29.660 --> 06:35.140
carriers, they might pass on flights to Guam just to avoid having to gain FAA approval.

06:35.140 --> 06:37.640
Another issue for Guam is the Jones Act.

06:37.640 --> 06:42.140
This law prevents foreign-built, owned, or operated ships from carrying cargo or passengers

06:42.140 --> 06:43.960
between US ports.

06:43.960 --> 06:47.400
This may make sense within the continental United States, just as you wouldn't want

06:47.400 --> 06:51.360
a foreign airline flying domestic cargo routes, you wouldn't want a foreign shipping company

06:51.360 --> 06:55.940
taking over cargo routes like Houston to Charleston or Seattle to Oakland, but Guam

06:55.940 --> 06:57.580
is a different story.

06:57.580 --> 07:01.480
Cargo ships generally make many stops along their routes so it would be perfectly normal

07:01.480 --> 07:07.520
for a Taiwanese ship, for example, to go from Oakland to Hawaii to Guam to Osaka to Taipei,

07:07.520 --> 07:11.680
but it can't because then it'd be transporting goods between US ports.

07:11.680 --> 07:16.300
Instead, only US ships can bring goods from the US, where most of Guam's goods come

07:16.300 --> 07:18.360
from, to Guam.

07:18.360 --> 07:22.280
Other US territories like American Samoa and the Northern Mariana Islands are exempt from

07:22.280 --> 07:27.600
this rule but Guam is still subject to it which makes shipping to the island more expensive.

07:27.600 --> 07:32.100
Despite the issues the US federal government may cause, the people of Guam are in no hurry

07:32.100 --> 07:33.960
to distance themselves from it.

07:33.960 --> 07:41.640
I think if you were to ask a majority of the people on the island, they would like to have

07:41.640 --> 07:47.560
a closer union with the United States and some may even want statehood.

07:47.560 --> 07:52.280
I mean, in fact, a majority of them would love to see statehood.

07:52.280 --> 07:56.700
In many ways, Guam is one of the most patriotic areas of the US.

07:56.700 --> 08:01.700
The US military freed Guam from a brutal and deadly Japanese occupation during World War

08:01.700 --> 08:04.720
II which many of the older residents still remember.

08:04.720 --> 08:08.880
The younger residents, meanwhile, quite often work for the US.

08:08.880 --> 08:14.160
Just about every family on this island, I'm sure almost every family on this island, had

08:14.160 --> 08:17.840
at least one member of their family serve in the military.

08:17.840 --> 08:22.680
One out of eight residents of Guam serve or have served in the US armed forces.

08:22.680 --> 08:28.000
It has a higher enlistment rate than any US state, but this is helped by the fact that

08:28.000 --> 08:31.380
a quarter of the island is US military bases.

08:31.380 --> 08:35.180
The island is one of the US military's most strategic assets.

08:35.180 --> 08:40.240
Of course the US has plenty of bases in Japan and South Korea, but Guam is US soil less

08:40.240 --> 08:45.040
than four hours away from North Korea, the East China Sea, and the South China Sea—all

08:45.040 --> 08:47.240
possible flashpoints for US conflict.

08:47.240 --> 08:53.040
The US military is the single largest employer on Guam and its economy depends on the military.

08:53.040 --> 08:56.660
While tourism may have suffered recently, the military business is good.

08:56.660 --> 09:00.520
The number of military personnel stationed on Guam is slated to more than double in the

09:00.520 --> 09:03.640
coming decade which will no doubt stimulate the economy.

09:03.640 --> 09:08.560
This doesn't come without concern—Guam only has so much land—but all factors considered,

09:08.960 --> 09:10.640
Guam is on the rise.

09:10.640 --> 09:12.760
Guam is truly a unique place.

09:12.760 --> 09:16.840
Plenty of countries have territories far away from their mainland, but few are as developed

09:16.840 --> 09:19.600
and similar to the rest of the country as Guam.

09:19.600 --> 09:24.480
If Guam was just off the coast of the US mainland it would be totally unremarkable—just another

09:24.480 --> 09:29.080
piece of the US that looks and acts like the rest of the US, but it's not—it's on

09:29.080 --> 09:31.080
the other side of the world.

09:31.080 --> 09:35.040
Guam is a relic of colonialism that today is a thriving, developed place.

09:35.040 --> 09:40.560
It may not get treated like the US, even by its own government, but in all other ways,

09:40.560 --> 09:42.960
Guam is the United States.

09:42.960 --> 09:46.000
One aspect of Guam's story that this video didn't cover is how they're trying to

09:46.000 --> 09:50.560
grow their local, small businesses in order to make the economy more self-sustaining.

09:50.560 --> 09:52.620
Squarespace also helps with this.

09:52.620 --> 09:57.560
They help small businesses make what was previously only available for huge companies—a great,

09:57.560 --> 10:00.240
beautifully designed, professional-looking website.

10:00.240 --> 10:03.000
Small businesses aren't necessarily physical stores.

10:03.000 --> 10:07.240
Whatever you do, whether it be photography, podcasting, YouTubing, anything you hope to

10:07.240 --> 10:11.140
make money from is a business and so you need to make sure people can find you.

10:11.140 --> 10:14.960
If you're anything like me, the first place you go to find something is the internet so

10:14.960 --> 10:19.280
it's absolutely crucial to have a great-looking website since that's your first impression.

10:19.280 --> 10:23.960
