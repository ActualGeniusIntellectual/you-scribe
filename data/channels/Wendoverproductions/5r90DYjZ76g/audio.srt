If you were just dropped in this place, with no prior knowledge, where would you guess

5
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:16,160
you were?

6
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:22,520
Maybe Florida or California or Hawaii, somewhere tropical, but this is definitely the US.

7
00:00:22,520 --> 00:00:24,680
It just looks like the US.

8
00:00:24,680 --> 00:00:28,860
From the style of signs to the way the roads look to the stores that line the streets,

9
00:00:28,860 --> 00:00:33,860
you can tell it's the US, but it's not Florida, it's not California, it's not

10
00:00:33,860 --> 00:00:37,460
Hawaii, it's not even on this side of the world.

11
00:00:37,460 --> 00:00:41,800
It's America's most isolated territory—it's Guam.

12
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:47,700
The United States has five inhabited territories—the US Virgin Islands, Puerto Rico, American Samoa,

13
00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:50,380
the Northern Mariana Islands, and Guam itself.

14
00:00:50,380 --> 00:00:55,540
Guam is the furthest of these five from the continental US—nearly 8,000 miles away from

15
00:00:55,540 --> 00:00:58,780
Washington DC, making it the most isolated.

16
00:00:58,780 --> 00:01:05,060
Beijing, Delhi, Cape Town, and Buenos Aires are all closer to DC than Guam is and yet

17
00:01:05,060 --> 00:01:08,860
the island is a fully fledged territory of the US.

18
00:01:08,860 --> 00:01:10,660
It is the US.

19
00:01:10,660 --> 00:01:15,500
Guam has been inhabited for thousands of years by the native Chamorro people until the 1500s

20
00:01:15,500 --> 00:01:18,180
when it was first claimed as a territory by Spain.

21
00:01:18,180 --> 00:01:22,100
Centuries later, after the US' victory in the Spanish-American War, the territory was

22
00:01:22,100 --> 00:01:25,620
ceded to the United States along with Puerto Rico and the Philippines.

23
00:01:25,620 --> 00:01:30,100
Aside from a brief and brutal Japanese occupation during World War II, the island has remained

24
00:01:30,100 --> 00:01:32,340
part of the US ever since.

25
00:01:32,340 --> 00:01:36,800
Many Americans had never even heard of Guam until summer 2017.

26
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:40,780
That was when North Korean leader Kim Jong-un threatened to launch a ballistic missile at

27
00:01:40,780 --> 00:01:41,780
Guam.

28
00:01:41,780 --> 00:01:46,100
The threats may have since subsided, but the effects of that summer have not.

29
00:01:46,100 --> 00:01:49,860
The island stretches less than 30 miles from top to bottom which makes it smaller than

30
00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:55,660
every other US state and territory and yet it packs more than 160,000 people into that

31
00:01:55,660 --> 00:01:56,660
small size.

32
00:01:56,660 --> 00:02:02,020
In fact, it's more densely populated than all but five US states or territories.

33
00:02:02,020 --> 00:02:06,480
Meanwhile, it is by far the most developed place in Micronesia.

34
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:10,800
To put it in perspective, Guam's neighboring islands, the Northern Mariana Islands, which

35
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:19,620
are also part of the US, have a GDP per capita of $16,800 while Guam's is more than $35,000.

36
00:02:19,620 --> 00:02:26,660
Chiribati, meanwhile, the most populous country in Micronesia, has a GDP per capita of $1,500.

37
00:02:26,660 --> 00:02:31,580
Guam is an outpost of the modern developed world in one of the poorest regions of the

38
00:02:31,580 --> 00:02:32,580
world.

39
00:02:32,580 --> 00:02:34,940
Its location, though, is its greatest asset.

40
00:02:34,940 --> 00:02:38,260
Its economy exists because of where it is.

41
00:02:38,260 --> 00:02:42,820
The island is three hours from Tokyo, four hours from Seoul, and five hours from Hong

42
00:02:42,820 --> 00:02:43,820
Kong.

43
00:02:43,820 --> 00:02:47,740
It's close to Asia, but it is still the US—unequivocally.

44
00:02:47,740 --> 00:02:52,700
You see American license plates, American-style ambulances, they have US post offices, they

45
00:02:52,700 --> 00:02:58,660
use the US dollar, they have American stores, American hotels, US national parks, US airlines,

46
00:02:58,660 --> 00:03:04,020
there is no compromise on the American-ness of Guam because it is the US.

47
00:03:04,020 --> 00:03:08,060
They fly the US flag and for tourists, this is a draw.

48
00:03:08,060 --> 00:03:12,260
Instead of flying seven hours to Hawaii or ten hours to California, Japanese tourists

49
00:03:12,260 --> 00:03:16,660
can and do just fly three hours to Guam in order to visit the US.

50
00:03:16,660 --> 00:03:21,100
The malls, which look identical to any in Virginia, or Kansas, or anywhere else in the

51
00:03:21,100 --> 00:03:25,980
US, are hugely popular with Asian tourists as they can buy American goods for a fraction

52
00:03:25,980 --> 00:03:27,820
of what they would cost in Asia.

53
00:03:27,820 --> 00:03:33,660
About 1.5 million people visit the island of 160,000 each year, but what's not good

54
00:03:33,660 --> 00:03:35,820
for tourism is missile threats.

55
00:03:36,380 --> 00:03:46,420
Last summer when they were playing Whose Missiles Bigger, we were the ones that suffered.

56
00:03:46,420 --> 00:03:51,020
Our tourism took a huge nosedive that month of August.

57
00:03:51,020 --> 00:03:57,740
We never saw so many news agencies come into Guam from countries that didn't even realize

58
00:03:57,740 --> 00:04:04,700
we existed because all of a sudden Kim Jong-un was threatening the American territory in

59
00:04:04,700 --> 00:04:05,800
the Pacific.

60
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:09,060
This is Benjamin Cruz, speaker of the Guam legislature.

61
00:04:09,060 --> 00:04:13,780
As he said, the island's economy suffered immensely from the North Korean missile threat.

62
00:04:13,780 --> 00:04:17,840
Many visitors of Guam come as part of school groups or corporate retreats and these groups

63
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:21,200
in particular almost universally cancelled their trips.

64
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:28,560
We lost, I mean almost our entire, I mean all of Japan stopped coming.

65
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:30,360
I mean everybody was afraid to come.

66
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:33,880
The only ones that were coming were the news media.

67
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:38,400
Fortunately, the effects were partially mitigated by an increase in visitors from South Korea

68
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:41,500
who were less worried about missile threats since it's a reality they live with every

69
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:47,060
day back home, but for an island so centered around tourism, being dragged into politics

70
00:04:47,060 --> 00:04:48,600
is never good.

71
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:52,860
Despite being part of the US, though, Guam functions politically differently from every

72
00:04:52,860 --> 00:04:54,600
other part of the US.

73
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:59,080
Benjamin Cruz, along with the 14 other senators, are the lawmakers of Guam.

74
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:03,500
They can legislate just like any state legislator but the main political difference for Guam

75
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:04,900
is at the federal level.

76
00:05:04,900 --> 00:05:09,400
All the US federal laws, the ones made in Washington for the whole country, all those

77
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:11,100
laws apply in Guam.

78
00:05:11,100 --> 00:05:14,180
What Guam doesn't get, though, is a vote.

79
00:05:14,180 --> 00:05:18,140
Their congressional representatives don't get a vote so by extension, the people of

80
00:05:18,140 --> 00:05:21,420
Guam can't vote on the laws that apply to them.

81
00:05:21,420 --> 00:05:26,300
In addition, unlike Washington DC, which also doesn't receive a vote in Congress, Guam,

82
00:05:26,300 --> 00:05:31,020
along with the other US territories, is not able to vote for their president—the US

83
00:05:31,020 --> 00:05:32,020
president.

84
00:05:32,020 --> 00:05:35,720
This represents an issue not only because of the lapse in democracy, but also because

85
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:41,160
many US laws that may make sense for the continental United States just don't for a territory

86
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:42,960
on the other side of the world.

87
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:51,760
We'd like to be able to invite people to the island and industries and not have to

88
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:56,960
worry about whether or not the SEC would approve it or the FCC would approve it.

89
00:05:56,960 --> 00:06:03,860
We'd like to be able to have control over our skies so we can invite airlines to fly

90
00:06:03,860 --> 00:06:10,060
in without having to clear with FAA on whether or not this airline or that airline can or

91
00:06:10,060 --> 00:06:11,840
cannot fly.

92
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:16,140
The process for a foreign airline of gaining approval to fly to the US is often long and

93
00:06:16,140 --> 00:06:20,260
laborious and there are a number of special security and immigration rules for flights

94
00:06:20,260 --> 00:06:21,260
to the US.

95
00:06:21,260 --> 00:06:25,600
This isn't a problem for large intercontinental airlines or Mexican or Canadian ones for whom

96
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:29,660
flights to the US represent a large part of their market, but for small, regional Asian

97
00:06:29,660 --> 00:06:35,140
carriers, they might pass on flights to Guam just to avoid having to gain FAA approval.

98
00:06:35,140 --> 00:06:37,640
Another issue for Guam is the Jones Act.

99
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:42,140
This law prevents foreign-built, owned, or operated ships from carrying cargo or passengers

100
00:06:42,140 --> 00:06:43,960
between US ports.

101
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:47,400
This may make sense within the continental United States, just as you wouldn't want

102
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:51,360
a foreign airline flying domestic cargo routes, you wouldn't want a foreign shipping company

103
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:55,940
taking over cargo routes like Houston to Charleston or Seattle to Oakland, but Guam

104
00:06:55,940 --> 00:06:57,580
is a different story.

105
00:06:57,580 --> 00:07:01,480
Cargo ships generally make many stops along their routes so it would be perfectly normal

106
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:07,520
for a Taiwanese ship, for example, to go from Oakland to Hawaii to Guam to Osaka to Taipei,

107
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:11,680
but it can't because then it'd be transporting goods between US ports.

108
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:16,300
Instead, only US ships can bring goods from the US, where most of Guam's goods come

109
00:07:16,300 --> 00:07:18,360
from, to Guam.

110
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:22,280
Other US territories like American Samoa and the Northern Mariana Islands are exempt from

111
00:07:22,280 --> 00:07:27,600
this rule but Guam is still subject to it which makes shipping to the island more expensive.

112
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:32,100
Despite the issues the US federal government may cause, the people of Guam are in no hurry

113
00:07:32,100 --> 00:07:33,960
to distance themselves from it.

114
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:41,640
I think if you were to ask a majority of the people on the island, they would like to have

115
00:07:41,640 --> 00:07:47,560
a closer union with the United States and some may even want statehood.

116
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:52,280
I mean, in fact, a majority of them would love to see statehood.

117
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:56,700
In many ways, Guam is one of the most patriotic areas of the US.

118
00:07:56,700 --> 00:08:01,700
The US military freed Guam from a brutal and deadly Japanese occupation during World War

119
00:08:01,700 --> 00:08:04,720
II which many of the older residents still remember.

120
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:08,880
The younger residents, meanwhile, quite often work for the US.

121
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:14,160
Just about every family on this island, I'm sure almost every family on this island, had

122
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:17,840
at least one member of their family serve in the military.

123
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:22,680
One out of eight residents of Guam serve or have served in the US armed forces.

124
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:28,000
It has a higher enlistment rate than any US state, but this is helped by the fact that

125
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:31,380
a quarter of the island is US military bases.

126
00:08:31,380 --> 00:08:35,180
The island is one of the US military's most strategic assets.

127
00:08:35,180 --> 00:08:40,240
Of course the US has plenty of bases in Japan and South Korea, but Guam is US soil less

128
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:45,040
than four hours away from North Korea, the East China Sea, and the South China Sea—all

129
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:47,240
possible flashpoints for US conflict.

130
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:53,040
The US military is the single largest employer on Guam and its economy depends on the military.

131
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:56,660
While tourism may have suffered recently, the military business is good.

132
00:08:56,660 --> 00:09:00,520
The number of military personnel stationed on Guam is slated to more than double in the

133
00:09:00,520 --> 00:09:03,640
coming decade which will no doubt stimulate the economy.

134
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:08,560
This doesn't come without concern—Guam only has so much land—but all factors considered,

135
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:10,640
Guam is on the rise.

136
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:12,760
Guam is truly a unique place.

137
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:16,840
Plenty of countries have territories far away from their mainland, but few are as developed

138
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:19,600
and similar to the rest of the country as Guam.

139
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:24,480
If Guam was just off the coast of the US mainland it would be totally unremarkable—just another

140
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:29,080
piece of the US that looks and acts like the rest of the US, but it's not—it's on

141
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:31,080
the other side of the world.

142
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:35,040
Guam is a relic of colonialism that today is a thriving, developed place.

143
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:40,560
It may not get treated like the US, even by its own government, but in all other ways,

144
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:42,960
Guam is the United States.

145
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:46,000
One aspect of Guam's story that this video didn't cover is how they're trying to

146
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:50,560
grow their local, small businesses in order to make the economy more self-sustaining.

147
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:52,620
Squarespace also helps with this.

148
00:09:52,620 --> 00:09:57,560
They help small businesses make what was previously only available for huge companies—a great,

149
00:09:57,560 --> 00:10:00,240
beautifully designed, professional-looking website.

150
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:03,000
Small businesses aren't necessarily physical stores.

151
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:07,240
Whatever you do, whether it be photography, podcasting, YouTubing, anything you hope to

152
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:11,140
make money from is a business and so you need to make sure people can find you.

153
00:10:11,140 --> 00:10:14,960
If you're anything like me, the first place you go to find something is the internet so

154
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:19,280
it's absolutely crucial to have a great-looking website since that's your first impression.

155
00:10:19,280 --> 00:10:23,960
