00:00.000 --> 00:08.700
College is expensive—like really expensive—especially here in the United States of guns, fast food,

00:08.700 --> 00:09.700
and student debt.

00:09.700 --> 00:11.780
It wasn't always this way.

00:11.780 --> 00:18.940
In 1980, the average cost of tuition for one year at a four-year private college was $3,500.

00:18.940 --> 00:22.780
Adjusted for inflation, that's $10,226.

00:22.780 --> 00:28.900
Today, that same year of college goes for $32,000—three times as much as only 36 years

00:28.900 --> 00:29.900
ago.

00:29.920 --> 00:30.920
What's behind this?

00:30.920 --> 00:34.000
Well that's both a complicated and controversial question.

00:34.000 --> 00:38.100
To understand why college has risen in cost, we first have to understand why college has

00:38.100 --> 00:39.620
always been expensive.

00:39.620 --> 00:42.280
The biggest fraction of your tuition goes to salaries.

00:42.280 --> 00:47.320
The national average student to faculty ratio is 18 to 1, meaning that for every 18 students,

00:47.320 --> 00:49.080
there's one faculty member.

00:49.080 --> 00:55.120
The average professor at a private college makes $126,981 per year divided by 18 that

00:55.120 --> 00:59.880
comes out to only $7,054 which doesn't seem that bad, but you have to consider that

00:59.980 --> 01:01.460
there's more than just faculty.

01:01.460 --> 01:06.120
There's also coaches and gardeners and kitchen staff and dorm staff and maintenance people

01:06.120 --> 01:10.940
and admissions staff and marketers and IT staff and security guards and college presidents.

01:10.940 --> 01:14.940
All together, the salaries and benefits of all these individuals add up to a whopping

01:14.940 --> 01:19.420
$24,000 of our $32,000 tuition.

01:19.420 --> 01:23.400
Salaries tend to be high because college functions similarly to many other industries, following

01:23.400 --> 01:25.640
the rules of supply and demand.

01:25.640 --> 01:29.860
The most popular college majors vary over time because interests change to reflect changes

01:29.860 --> 01:30.960
in culture.

01:30.960 --> 01:34.340
The problem is, you can't just magically create new professors.

01:34.340 --> 01:37.840
By the time new professors go through their 20 years of education and specialize in a

01:37.840 --> 01:42.200
field, the major will no longer be the popular one, so when a major is popular, colleges

01:42.200 --> 01:46.580
have to compete to get professors and the only thing that really matters is money.

01:46.580 --> 01:50.740
Money brings more professors, more professors bring more students, and more students bring

01:50.740 --> 01:51.860
more money.

01:51.860 --> 01:56.100
At the same time, professors in historically popular majors receive tenure.

01:56.140 --> 02:00.060
The tenure is the idea that in order to promote academic freedom, longtime professors should

02:00.060 --> 02:02.580
have their job guaranteed until retirement.

02:02.580 --> 02:06.920
With professors that legally cannot be let go, there can often be an abundance of professors

02:06.920 --> 02:09.220
in less popular study areas.

02:09.220 --> 02:13.260
So we still have $8,000 of tuition unaccounted for.

02:13.260 --> 02:18.200
Colleges need places to teach and their infrastructure is rather unnaturally expensive.

02:18.200 --> 02:23.660
Classes only run for 8 or 10 hours a day, 5 days a week, for 40 or so weeks a year.

02:23.660 --> 02:27.920
That means that classrooms are only in use 23% of the time.

02:27.920 --> 02:31.900
The college still has to pay for the space the other 77% of the time which of course

02:31.900 --> 02:33.100
adds up.

02:33.100 --> 02:37.860
Additionally, colleges really like to build nice buildings because these attract students.

02:37.860 --> 02:42.780
The average cost to build a building varies by location, but it averages between $115

02:42.780 --> 02:44.980
and $215 per square foot.

02:44.980 --> 02:50.860
By contrast, UMass Amherst Commonwealth Honors College costs $354 per square foot, UMass

02:50.860 --> 02:56.380
Boston's General Academic Building number one costs $594 per square foot, and Berkeley's

02:56.380 --> 03:00.460
Lower Sproul Building costs $654 per square foot.

03:00.460 --> 03:04.360
Of course there are other factors contributing to the high price of college, but staffing

03:04.360 --> 03:06.300
and buildings are the big two.

03:06.300 --> 03:08.660
Now for the reason college has tripled in price.

03:08.660 --> 03:12.480
It's always been expensive to pay highly educated people to teach in inefficiently

03:12.480 --> 03:15.860
used buildings, so what has changed in the last 30 years?

03:15.860 --> 03:18.040
Well, college is more popular than ever.

03:18.040 --> 03:22.400
In the last 20 years, college enrollment has increased by 50%.

03:22.400 --> 03:26.200
Federal and state funding for colleges has actually increased to an all-time high since

03:26.200 --> 03:31.520
1980, but with the simultaneous increase in students, per-student funding has hit an all-time

03:31.520 --> 03:32.520
low.

03:32.520 --> 03:38.480
In 1990, Ohio's flagship public university, Ohio State University, paid for 25% of their

03:38.480 --> 03:44.320
budget with government money, while in 2012, only 7% of their budget was paid for by the

03:44.320 --> 03:45.320
state.

03:45.320 --> 03:49.840
With federal and state money, students have to pay more out of pocket to make up the difference.

03:49.840 --> 03:53.440
Additionally, colleges have changed to appeal to the millennial generation.

03:53.440 --> 03:58.320
According to William Strauss and Neil Howe, the millennial generation, born between 1982

03:58.320 --> 04:01.760
and 2004, are characterized by seven core traits.

04:01.760 --> 04:06.800
They are sheltered, confident, team-oriented, conventional, pressured, achieving, and they

04:06.800 --> 04:08.040
feel special.

04:08.040 --> 04:12.100
Sometimes called trophy kids, millennials tend to be more ambitious and more unique

04:12.100 --> 04:15.540
than the preceding generation which means that they tend to believe more in the right

04:15.540 --> 04:17.680
fit idea for college.

04:17.680 --> 04:21.280
Colleges responded to this attitude by adding more and more amenities to help them stand

04:21.280 --> 04:23.400
out to the growing number of students.

04:23.400 --> 04:27.360
All these new amenities required more and more management which contributed to the boom

04:27.360 --> 04:29.660
in administration at universities.

04:29.660 --> 04:33.700
According to the US Department of Education, the number of administrator positions increased

04:33.700 --> 04:40.440
60% between 1993 and 2009 which is 10 times faster than the number of tenured professor

04:40.440 --> 04:41.440
positions.

04:41.780 --> 04:45.120
So, just as I finished my why flying is so expensive video by telling you that flying

04:45.120 --> 04:48.920
is not that expensive, I'll finish this video by telling you that college is not that

04:48.920 --> 04:49.920
expensive.

04:49.920 --> 04:55.460
85% of full time degree seeking students at four year universities receive some sort of

04:55.460 --> 04:59.480
financial aid with the average grant hovering at around $15,500.

04:59.480 --> 05:03.880
That's a significant amount, but I'll admit that there's still a significant amount

05:03.880 --> 05:04.880
left over.

05:04.880 --> 05:08.860
Until you consider that going to college is the single greatest investment you can make

05:08.860 --> 05:11.240
in your life, especially today.

05:11.240 --> 05:15.560
People who go to college earn on average 98% more than those who only have a high school

05:15.560 --> 05:20.620
diploma, and that number is up from only 40% 35 years ago.

05:20.620 --> 05:23.560
So given that, what's the true cost of college?

05:23.560 --> 05:27.440
When you look at it holistically, over your whole life, the cost of going to college is

05:27.440 --> 05:35.640
not $32,000 a year or $128,000 over four years, but rather negative $500,000.

05:35.640 --> 05:40.980
By skipping the opportunity to go to college, you will forfeit on average half a million

05:40.980 --> 05:42.960
dollars in potential earnings.

05:42.960 --> 05:44.440
Go to college kids.

05:44.440 --> 05:45.680
Thank you for watching.

05:45.680 --> 05:51.920
I'm very excited to say, for the first time ever, this video is sponsored by Audible.com.

05:51.920 --> 05:56.680
Audible is a company that I admire a lot and have used for years before this sponsorship.

05:56.680 --> 06:01.620
As I imagine any subscriber of Wendover Productions does too, I love learning, and a great way

06:01.620 --> 06:03.540
to learn is through reading books.

06:03.540 --> 06:07.980
The problem is, I live a busy life and rarely have time to sit down and read a book.

06:07.980 --> 06:13.180
Instead, I fit reading into my schedule by listening to books when driving, doing dishes,

06:13.180 --> 06:14.320
running, whenever.

06:14.320 --> 06:19.360
Audible has an amazing selection of 250,000 titles including one of the best non-fiction

06:19.360 --> 06:23.900
