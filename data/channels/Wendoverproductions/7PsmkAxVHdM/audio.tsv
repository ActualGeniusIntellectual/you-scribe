0	8700	College is expensive—like really expensive—especially here in the United States of guns, fast food,
8700	9700	and student debt.
9700	11780	It wasn't always this way.
11780	18940	In 1980, the average cost of tuition for one year at a four-year private college was $3,500.
18940	22780	Adjusted for inflation, that's $10,226.
22780	28900	Today, that same year of college goes for $32,000—three times as much as only 36 years
28900	29900	ago.
29920	30920	What's behind this?
30920	34000	Well that's both a complicated and controversial question.
34000	38100	To understand why college has risen in cost, we first have to understand why college has
38100	39620	always been expensive.
39620	42280	The biggest fraction of your tuition goes to salaries.
42280	47320	The national average student to faculty ratio is 18 to 1, meaning that for every 18 students,
47320	49080	there's one faculty member.
49080	55120	The average professor at a private college makes $126,981 per year divided by 18 that
55120	59880	comes out to only $7,054 which doesn't seem that bad, but you have to consider that
59980	61460	there's more than just faculty.
61460	66120	There's also coaches and gardeners and kitchen staff and dorm staff and maintenance people
66120	70940	and admissions staff and marketers and IT staff and security guards and college presidents.
70940	74940	All together, the salaries and benefits of all these individuals add up to a whopping
74940	79420	$24,000 of our $32,000 tuition.
79420	83400	Salaries tend to be high because college functions similarly to many other industries, following
83400	85640	the rules of supply and demand.
85640	89860	The most popular college majors vary over time because interests change to reflect changes
89860	90960	in culture.
90960	94340	The problem is, you can't just magically create new professors.
94340	97840	By the time new professors go through their 20 years of education and specialize in a
97840	102200	field, the major will no longer be the popular one, so when a major is popular, colleges
102200	106580	have to compete to get professors and the only thing that really matters is money.
106580	110740	Money brings more professors, more professors bring more students, and more students bring
110740	111860	more money.
111860	116100	At the same time, professors in historically popular majors receive tenure.
116140	120060	The tenure is the idea that in order to promote academic freedom, longtime professors should
120060	122580	have their job guaranteed until retirement.
122580	126920	With professors that legally cannot be let go, there can often be an abundance of professors
126920	129220	in less popular study areas.
129220	133260	So we still have $8,000 of tuition unaccounted for.
133260	138200	Colleges need places to teach and their infrastructure is rather unnaturally expensive.
138200	143660	Classes only run for 8 or 10 hours a day, 5 days a week, for 40 or so weeks a year.
143660	147920	That means that classrooms are only in use 23% of the time.
147920	151900	The college still has to pay for the space the other 77% of the time which of course
151900	153100	adds up.
153100	157860	Additionally, colleges really like to build nice buildings because these attract students.
157860	162780	The average cost to build a building varies by location, but it averages between $115
162780	164980	and $215 per square foot.
164980	170860	By contrast, UMass Amherst Commonwealth Honors College costs $354 per square foot, UMass
170860	176380	Boston's General Academic Building number one costs $594 per square foot, and Berkeley's
176380	180460	Lower Sproul Building costs $654 per square foot.
180460	184360	Of course there are other factors contributing to the high price of college, but staffing
184360	186300	and buildings are the big two.
186300	188660	Now for the reason college has tripled in price.
188660	192480	It's always been expensive to pay highly educated people to teach in inefficiently
192480	195860	used buildings, so what has changed in the last 30 years?
195860	198040	Well, college is more popular than ever.
198040	202400	In the last 20 years, college enrollment has increased by 50%.
202400	206200	Federal and state funding for colleges has actually increased to an all-time high since
206200	211520	1980, but with the simultaneous increase in students, per-student funding has hit an all-time
211520	212520	low.
212520	218480	In 1990, Ohio's flagship public university, Ohio State University, paid for 25% of their
218480	224320	budget with government money, while in 2012, only 7% of their budget was paid for by the
224320	225320	state.
225320	229840	With federal and state money, students have to pay more out of pocket to make up the difference.
229840	233440	Additionally, colleges have changed to appeal to the millennial generation.
233440	238320	According to William Strauss and Neil Howe, the millennial generation, born between 1982
238320	241760	and 2004, are characterized by seven core traits.
241760	246800	They are sheltered, confident, team-oriented, conventional, pressured, achieving, and they
246800	248040	feel special.
248040	252100	Sometimes called trophy kids, millennials tend to be more ambitious and more unique
252100	255540	than the preceding generation which means that they tend to believe more in the right
255540	257680	fit idea for college.
257680	261280	Colleges responded to this attitude by adding more and more amenities to help them stand
261280	263400	out to the growing number of students.
263400	267360	All these new amenities required more and more management which contributed to the boom
267360	269660	in administration at universities.
269660	273700	According to the US Department of Education, the number of administrator positions increased
273700	280440	60% between 1993 and 2009 which is 10 times faster than the number of tenured professor
280440	281440	positions.
281780	285120	So, just as I finished my why flying is so expensive video by telling you that flying
285120	288920	is not that expensive, I'll finish this video by telling you that college is not that
288920	289920	expensive.
289920	295460	85% of full time degree seeking students at four year universities receive some sort of
295460	299480	financial aid with the average grant hovering at around $15,500.
299480	303880	That's a significant amount, but I'll admit that there's still a significant amount
303880	304880	left over.
304880	308860	Until you consider that going to college is the single greatest investment you can make
308860	311240	in your life, especially today.
311240	315560	People who go to college earn on average 98% more than those who only have a high school
315560	320620	diploma, and that number is up from only 40% 35 years ago.
320620	323560	So given that, what's the true cost of college?
323560	327440	When you look at it holistically, over your whole life, the cost of going to college is
327440	335640	not $32,000 a year or $128,000 over four years, but rather negative $500,000.
335640	340980	By skipping the opportunity to go to college, you will forfeit on average half a million
340980	342960	dollars in potential earnings.
342960	344440	Go to college kids.
344440	345680	Thank you for watching.

361620	363540	to learn is through reading books.
363540	367980	The problem is, I live a busy life and rarely have time to sit down and read a book.

373180	374320	running, whenever.
