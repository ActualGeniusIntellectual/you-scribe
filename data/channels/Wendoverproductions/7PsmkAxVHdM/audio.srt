1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,700
College is expensive—like really expensive—especially here in the United States of guns, fast food,

2
00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:09,700
and student debt.

3
00:00:09,700 --> 00:00:11,780
It wasn't always this way.

4
00:00:11,780 --> 00:00:18,940
In 1980, the average cost of tuition for one year at a four-year private college was $3,500.

5
00:00:18,940 --> 00:00:22,780
Adjusted for inflation, that's $10,226.

6
00:00:22,780 --> 00:00:28,900
Today, that same year of college goes for $32,000—three times as much as only 36 years

7
00:00:28,900 --> 00:00:29,900
ago.

8
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:30,920
What's behind this?

9
00:00:30,920 --> 00:00:34,000
Well that's both a complicated and controversial question.

10
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,100
To understand why college has risen in cost, we first have to understand why college has

11
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:39,620
always been expensive.

12
00:00:39,620 --> 00:00:42,280
The biggest fraction of your tuition goes to salaries.

13
00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:47,320
The national average student to faculty ratio is 18 to 1, meaning that for every 18 students,

14
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:49,080
there's one faculty member.

15
00:00:49,080 --> 00:00:55,120
The average professor at a private college makes $126,981 per year divided by 18 that

16
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:59,880
comes out to only $7,054 which doesn't seem that bad, but you have to consider that

17
00:00:59,980 --> 00:01:01,460
there's more than just faculty.

18
00:01:01,460 --> 00:01:06,120
There's also coaches and gardeners and kitchen staff and dorm staff and maintenance people

19
00:01:06,120 --> 00:01:10,940
and admissions staff and marketers and IT staff and security guards and college presidents.

20
00:01:10,940 --> 00:01:14,940
All together, the salaries and benefits of all these individuals add up to a whopping

21
00:01:14,940 --> 00:01:19,420
$24,000 of our $32,000 tuition.

22
00:01:19,420 --> 00:01:23,400
Salaries tend to be high because college functions similarly to many other industries, following

23
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:25,640
the rules of supply and demand.

24
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:29,860
The most popular college majors vary over time because interests change to reflect changes

25
00:01:29,860 --> 00:01:30,960
in culture.

26
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:34,340
The problem is, you can't just magically create new professors.

27
00:01:34,340 --> 00:01:37,840
By the time new professors go through their 20 years of education and specialize in a

28
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:42,200
field, the major will no longer be the popular one, so when a major is popular, colleges

29
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:46,580
have to compete to get professors and the only thing that really matters is money.

30
00:01:46,580 --> 00:01:50,740
Money brings more professors, more professors bring more students, and more students bring

31
00:01:50,740 --> 00:01:51,860
more money.

32
00:01:51,860 --> 00:01:56,100
At the same time, professors in historically popular majors receive tenure.

33
00:01:56,140 --> 00:02:00,060
The tenure is the idea that in order to promote academic freedom, longtime professors should

34
00:02:00,060 --> 00:02:02,580
have their job guaranteed until retirement.

35
00:02:02,580 --> 00:02:06,920
With professors that legally cannot be let go, there can often be an abundance of professors

36
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:09,220
in less popular study areas.

37
00:02:09,220 --> 00:02:13,260
So we still have $8,000 of tuition unaccounted for.

38
00:02:13,260 --> 00:02:18,200
Colleges need places to teach and their infrastructure is rather unnaturally expensive.

39
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:23,660
Classes only run for 8 or 10 hours a day, 5 days a week, for 40 or so weeks a year.

40
00:02:23,660 --> 00:02:27,920
That means that classrooms are only in use 23% of the time.

41
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:31,900
The college still has to pay for the space the other 77% of the time which of course

42
00:02:31,900 --> 00:02:33,100
adds up.

43
00:02:33,100 --> 00:02:37,860
Additionally, colleges really like to build nice buildings because these attract students.

44
00:02:37,860 --> 00:02:42,780
The average cost to build a building varies by location, but it averages between $115

45
00:02:42,780 --> 00:02:44,980
and $215 per square foot.

46
00:02:44,980 --> 00:02:50,860
By contrast, UMass Amherst Commonwealth Honors College costs $354 per square foot, UMass

47
00:02:50,860 --> 00:02:56,380
Boston's General Academic Building number one costs $594 per square foot, and Berkeley's

48
00:02:56,380 --> 00:03:00,460
Lower Sproul Building costs $654 per square foot.

49
00:03:00,460 --> 00:03:04,360
Of course there are other factors contributing to the high price of college, but staffing

50
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:06,300
and buildings are the big two.

51
00:03:06,300 --> 00:03:08,660
Now for the reason college has tripled in price.

52
00:03:08,660 --> 00:03:12,480
It's always been expensive to pay highly educated people to teach in inefficiently

53
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:15,860
used buildings, so what has changed in the last 30 years?

54
00:03:15,860 --> 00:03:18,040
Well, college is more popular than ever.

55
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:22,400
In the last 20 years, college enrollment has increased by 50%.

56
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:26,200
Federal and state funding for colleges has actually increased to an all-time high since

57
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:31,520
1980, but with the simultaneous increase in students, per-student funding has hit an all-time

58
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:32,520
low.

59
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:38,480
In 1990, Ohio's flagship public university, Ohio State University, paid for 25% of their

60
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:44,320
budget with government money, while in 2012, only 7% of their budget was paid for by the

61
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:45,320
state.

62
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:49,840
With federal and state money, students have to pay more out of pocket to make up the difference.

63
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:53,440
Additionally, colleges have changed to appeal to the millennial generation.

64
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:58,320
According to William Strauss and Neil Howe, the millennial generation, born between 1982

65
00:03:58,320 --> 00:04:01,760
and 2004, are characterized by seven core traits.

66
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:06,800
They are sheltered, confident, team-oriented, conventional, pressured, achieving, and they

67
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:08,040
feel special.

68
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:12,100
Sometimes called trophy kids, millennials tend to be more ambitious and more unique

69
00:04:12,100 --> 00:04:15,540
than the preceding generation which means that they tend to believe more in the right

70
00:04:15,540 --> 00:04:17,680
fit idea for college.

71
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:21,280
Colleges responded to this attitude by adding more and more amenities to help them stand

72
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:23,400
out to the growing number of students.

73
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:27,360
All these new amenities required more and more management which contributed to the boom

74
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:29,660
in administration at universities.

75
00:04:29,660 --> 00:04:33,700
According to the US Department of Education, the number of administrator positions increased

76
00:04:33,700 --> 00:04:40,440
60% between 1993 and 2009 which is 10 times faster than the number of tenured professor

77
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:41,440
positions.

78
00:04:41,780 --> 00:04:45,120
So, just as I finished my why flying is so expensive video by telling you that flying

79
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:48,920
is not that expensive, I'll finish this video by telling you that college is not that

80
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:49,920
expensive.

81
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:55,460
85% of full time degree seeking students at four year universities receive some sort of

82
00:04:55,460 --> 00:04:59,480
financial aid with the average grant hovering at around $15,500.

83
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:03,880
That's a significant amount, but I'll admit that there's still a significant amount

84
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:04,880
left over.

85
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:08,860
Until you consider that going to college is the single greatest investment you can make

86
00:05:08,860 --> 00:05:11,240
in your life, especially today.

87
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:15,560
People who go to college earn on average 98% more than those who only have a high school

88
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:20,620
diploma, and that number is up from only 40% 35 years ago.

89
00:05:20,620 --> 00:05:23,560
So given that, what's the true cost of college?

90
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:27,440
When you look at it holistically, over your whole life, the cost of going to college is

91
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:35,640
not $32,000 a year or $128,000 over four years, but rather negative $500,000.

92
00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:40,980
By skipping the opportunity to go to college, you will forfeit on average half a million

93
00:05:40,980 --> 00:05:42,960
dollars in potential earnings.

94
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:44,440
Go to college kids.

95
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:45,680
Thank you for watching.

96
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:51,920
I'm very excited to say, for the first time ever, this video is sponsored by Audible.com.

97
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:56,680
Audible is a company that I admire a lot and have used for years before this sponsorship.

98
00:05:56,680 --> 00:06:01,620
As I imagine any subscriber of Wendover Productions does too, I love learning, and a great way

99
00:06:01,620 --> 00:06:03,540
to learn is through reading books.

100
00:06:03,540 --> 00:06:07,980
The problem is, I live a busy life and rarely have time to sit down and read a book.

101
00:06:07,980 --> 00:06:13,180
Instead, I fit reading into my schedule by listening to books when driving, doing dishes,

102
00:06:13,180 --> 00:06:14,320
running, whenever.

103
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:19,360
Audible has an amazing selection of 250,000 titles including one of the best non-fiction

104
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:23,900
books of all time and a personal favorite of mine, Freakonomics, which can be yours
