00:00.000 --> 00:04.560
If high-speed rail should work anywhere in America, it's here.

00:04.560 --> 00:09.960
Below this line lives a population of nearly 20 million people—6.5 million in the Miami

00:09.960 --> 00:15.760
metro area, 3 million in the Tampa metro, and another 2.5 million in the Orlando area.

00:15.760 --> 00:20.660
This massive population is relatively confined, by American standards, meaning it's dense

00:20.660 --> 00:24.260
and centralized enough to coalesce around a few stations.

00:24.260 --> 00:29.000
And with each of these three metro areas sitting within about 200 miles or 320 kilometers from

00:29.000 --> 00:33.160
each other, they're close enough that flying is awkwardly involved, but far enough that

00:33.160 --> 00:35.980
fighting interstate traffic for hours is a pain.

00:35.980 --> 00:39.920
There are also plenty of reasons to move between these areas—there are the beaches along

00:39.920 --> 00:44.080
the east coast, the businesses on the shores of Tampa Bay, the culture emanating out of

00:44.080 --> 00:49.280
Miami, and the entertainment of Orlando that each pull out-of-town tourists, in-state travelers,

00:49.280 --> 00:52.800
and Floridian businesspeople alike from one city to the next.

00:52.800 --> 00:57.920
And finally, geographically speaking, there's really little getting in the way of the rails—no

00:57.920 --> 01:02.880
town ranges, no gaping canyons, no physical impediments that would require any great feat

01:02.880 --> 01:04.040
of engineering.

01:04.040 --> 01:06.360
Of course, none of this is anything new.

01:06.360 --> 01:10.960
As far back as the 80s, Floridians and federal planners alike have been scouring over maps,

01:10.960 --> 01:15.500
calculating projections, and pitching the idea of connecting Tampa to Orlando to Miami

01:15.500 --> 01:20.360
with a train route that wouldn't cost the traveler a day, but a matter of hours.

01:20.360 --> 01:24.000
But no public-private partnership could get it done in the 80s.

01:24.000 --> 01:30.000
Nor could they get it done in the 90s, nor the 2000s, nor, for that matter, the 2010s.

01:30.000 --> 01:34.120
But not long after the most recent public-private partnership died on Governor Rick Scott's

01:34.120 --> 01:40.740
desk in 2011 came another high-speed rail pitch—one equal parts exciting and far off.

01:40.740 --> 01:45.520
It was called All Aboard Florida—it launched in 2012, and projected that, at a cost of

01:45.520 --> 01:51.040
a billion dollars, it'd be running a service from South Florida to Orlando by 2014.

01:51.040 --> 01:54.820
Like those before it, All Aboard Florida blew through its initial cost estimate and

01:54.820 --> 02:00.840
far past its projected opening date, but unlike those before it, All Aboard Florida, now rebranded

02:00.840 --> 02:06.720
as Brightline, actually opened for actual rail passengers in 2018.

02:06.720 --> 02:11.480
Fast and fully private, it was the first of its kind in the US.

02:11.480 --> 02:14.000
The initial service was modest.

02:14.000 --> 02:18.960
Far from the vision of 230 miles or 370 kilometers of track connecting the major metro areas

02:18.960 --> 02:23.720
of Central and South Florida, the deeply discounted $10 and $15 tickets offered on

02:23.720 --> 02:29.000
January 13, 2018 could get a traveler not from Orlando to Miami, but the 40 minutes

02:29.000 --> 02:31.160
from Fort Lauderdale to West Palm Beach.

02:31.160 --> 02:35.920
And while service would soon expand to the 66 miles or 110 kilometers connecting West

02:35.920 --> 02:41.460
Palm Beach and Miami, Brightline still wasn't offering a high-speed rail service, but rather

02:41.460 --> 02:47.280
a higher-speed service—not yet touching the 125-mile or 200-kilometer-per-hour high-speed

02:47.280 --> 02:52.760
criteria, but maxing out at 79 miles or 130 kilometers per hour.

02:52.760 --> 02:57.420
Still only running a 70-mile stretch at pedestrian speeds by the rest of the world's standards,

02:57.420 --> 03:03.640
Brightline opening to real-life customers in 2018 marked an extreme rarity in the US—a

03:03.640 --> 03:09.960
new passenger rail project actually becoming a real-world reality.

03:09.960 --> 03:14.480
High-speed or even higher-speed rail represents the ultimate long-term investment, and Brightline

03:14.480 --> 03:15.480
is no exception.

03:15.680 --> 03:20.080
Of course, Brightline, for its part, had some advantages—most notably the fact that its

03:20.080 --> 03:24.480
parent company, Florida East Coast Industries, just so happened to be the owner of the Florida

03:24.480 --> 03:26.240
East Coast Railway.

03:26.240 --> 03:30.240
While other suitors would have to negotiate and lease a rail corridor, Brightline already

03:30.240 --> 03:35.960
had access to the very railroad that had effectively built South Florida a century prior—but

03:35.960 --> 03:39.580
having access to a rail corridor was only the first step.

03:39.580 --> 03:43.720
To run frequent and fast service, Brightline first had to build an entirely new second

03:43.720 --> 03:47.740
set of rails along more than two-thirds of the 66-mile corridor.

03:47.740 --> 03:52.120
While straightforward enough, double-tracking takes time and money, and making this more

03:52.120 --> 03:55.600
difficult were the rivers and canals the rail had to cross.

03:55.600 --> 03:59.880
While each was already spanned by a bridge, nearly every bridge was only wide enough for

03:59.880 --> 04:03.840
one set of rails, not two, so nearly all had to be replaced.

04:03.840 --> 04:08.580
Then, in the sections where rail could be reused, there was the issue of alignment.

04:08.580 --> 04:12.000
To accommodate passenger trains moving at twice the speed of the freight trains for

04:12.000 --> 04:15.920
which the rails had been designed, crews would need to manually move rail into more

04:15.920 --> 04:18.860
gradual turns and straighter alignments.

04:18.860 --> 04:22.720
Just these rail alterations alone—not to mention all the signaling upgrades and siting

04:22.720 --> 04:28.600
alterations—along just this section of rail represented three years of work by the company.

04:28.600 --> 04:31.960
While readying the rails, Brightline needed stations, too.

04:31.960 --> 04:35.660
It started with these three, building each from the ground up and negotiating agreements

04:35.660 --> 04:39.400
and connections with each municipality and their local mass transit system to connect

04:39.400 --> 04:42.560
its inner-city rails with other intra-city options.

04:42.560 --> 04:46.680
Each was designed to look modern and provide services beyond just a stop.

04:46.680 --> 04:52.080
The crown jewel was the Miami Central Station, spanning some 9 acres or 4 city blocks and

04:52.080 --> 04:57.400
housing elevated platforms, restaurants and shops, some 300 parking spots, and two 38-story

04:57.400 --> 04:59.920
towers holding 800 apartments.

04:59.920 --> 05:03.800
Just to turn this into a serviceable routing, to provide an hour-and-15-minute trip from

05:03.800 --> 05:10.040
Miami to West Palm Beach for somewhere around $20-50 each way, it took Brightline six years

05:10.040 --> 05:14.100
of navigating everything from municipal and federal environmental impact statements to

05:14.100 --> 05:17.720
rail straightenings and multi-million dollar construction projects.

05:17.720 --> 05:20.480
And that was just phase one.

05:20.480 --> 05:25.580
Undaunted by delays or cost in the first place, Brightline began construction on a shining

05:25.580 --> 05:31.060
new station connected to the Orlando International Airport, and in the fall of 2023, service

05:31.060 --> 05:34.440
from Miami to Orlando opened to the public.

05:34.440 --> 05:39.480
And Brightline isn't slowing down, as work on phase 3, from Orlando to Tampa, has already

05:39.480 --> 05:40.480
begun.

05:40.480 --> 05:45.320
But Brightline's biggest hurdle wasn't design, and it wasn't planning, and it wasn't

05:45.320 --> 05:49.720
construction, because Brightline was not just another passenger rail project.

05:49.720 --> 05:54.380
It was an American passenger rail project, and no matter how fiercely private it may

05:54.380 --> 05:59.700
insist it is, it wasn't going to get anywhere without a huge degree of political support,

05:59.700 --> 06:04.300
and that's tough to come by for passenger railways in America these days.

06:04.300 --> 06:06.560
But it tried a new technique.

06:06.560 --> 06:12.140
Publicly, it portrayed itself as a fully private, capitalistic organization developing a service

06:12.140 --> 06:15.600
at the whim of the free market, at no risk to the taxpayer.

06:15.600 --> 06:20.000
Privately, though, it worked closely with the state and federal government to finally

06:20.000 --> 06:23.480
complete what politicians never could.

06:23.480 --> 06:28.360
Buried deep in the 500s of the 4,000 or so pages of the Internal Revenue Service's tax

06:28.360 --> 06:32.780
code is a series of sections setting strict parameters on a very particular financial

06:32.780 --> 06:39.800
mechanism known as private activity bonds, or PABs, and on page 555 in particular, one

06:39.800 --> 06:48.060
line of Part A of Section 142 opens up high-speed intercity rail as eligible issuers of PABs.

06:48.060 --> 06:51.060
PABs are simple in concept.

06:51.060 --> 06:54.820
Companies regularly issue bonds to raise money for big projects that they think will turn

06:54.820 --> 06:59.380
a profit in the long term, but that require a huge amount of upfront investment.

06:59.380 --> 07:03.260
They pay the buyer back in installments, plus interest, so the company will end up paying

07:03.260 --> 07:07.080
more than the bond purchase price in sum, but through this they can reduce what they

07:07.080 --> 07:10.140
need to pay annually to below their expected revenue.

07:10.140 --> 07:14.380
But as with any sort of earnings, the bond buyer has to pay taxes on the income generated

07:14.380 --> 07:19.220
by the bond's interest—unless they buy a government bond.

07:19.220 --> 07:23.440
Governments often issue tax-exempt bonds that still pay interest yet include the right

07:23.440 --> 07:26.480
to not pay tax on that interest.

07:26.480 --> 07:30.920
This allows the government to offer a lower-than-average interest rate, which saves them money, yet

07:30.920 --> 07:35.360
still find bond buyers summing to the total they need since the lack of taxes offsets

07:35.360 --> 07:36.760
the reduced interest income.

07:36.760 --> 07:40.480
They're able to do this, of course, since they're also the authority in charge of

07:40.480 --> 07:41.960
setting tax policy.

07:41.960 --> 07:48.440
PABs, however, are an exceptional instance where non-government bonds qualify as tax-free,

07:48.440 --> 07:50.660
but only if the government says so.

07:50.660 --> 07:54.300
The government will approve the issuance of a certain value's worth of PABs if they

07:54.300 --> 07:58.900
believe a private company is doing something in the public interest that they want to incentivize,

07:58.900 --> 08:01.460
such as passenger rail development.

08:01.460 --> 08:06.440
Following an expansion of eligibility and issuances in 2005, the private sector jumped

08:06.440 --> 08:07.440
on the opportunity.

08:07.440 --> 08:13.460
Centerpoint, for example, raised some $225 million through PABs to build the country's

08:13.460 --> 08:17.900
largest inland port near Chicago, acting as a massive connecting node between America's

08:17.900 --> 08:20.260
truck and rail freight networks.

08:20.260 --> 08:24.620
Using operating and selling intermodal logistics hubs like this is the bread and butter of

08:24.620 --> 08:29.940
what Centerpoint does, but this was an opportunity to do so at a discount and, in the federal

08:29.940 --> 08:33.660
government's eyes, forgoing the tens of millions of dollars of tax revenue was worth

08:33.660 --> 08:37.780
it to strengthen America's freight transportation network, even if it would be a profitable

08:37.780 --> 08:42.520
venture for a private enterprise, since improved freight logistics would likely raise the national

08:42.520 --> 08:44.300
tax base overall.

08:44.620 --> 08:51.300
This is one of the most objectively private PAB-funded projects—others blur the lines.

08:51.300 --> 08:55.620
The greater Louisville, Kentucky area has long had chronic traffic problems, especially

08:55.620 --> 09:00.440
given its geography sitting on the massive Ohio River—there used to be incredible backups

09:00.440 --> 09:04.600
to get to the Indiana side, and vice versa, so the two states and the federal government

09:04.600 --> 09:08.500
decided they needed a bridge to its north to divert through traffic away from the city

09:08.500 --> 09:11.620
by connecting two isolated sections of interstate.

09:11.620 --> 09:16.140
Now, this undertaking was planned and designed by the government, yet when it came time to

09:16.140 --> 09:21.020
actually build and operate this massive, costly bridge, the entire project was essentially

09:21.020 --> 09:27.040
handed over to a consortium formed by Vinci and BBGI—two massive, multinational infrastructure

09:27.040 --> 09:28.340
investment firms.

09:28.340 --> 09:33.940
This consortium then, on the federal government's blessing, went and issued $677 million in

09:33.940 --> 09:38.380
private activity bonds to pay for the construction of the bridge, and now, with it open, they're

09:38.380 --> 09:42.380
paying these bonds back using the toll revenue they collect from a long-term operating agreement

09:42.380 --> 09:44.540
lasting till 2051.

09:44.540 --> 09:48.420
From the public's perspective, though, this isn't anything novel—the bridge looks

09:48.420 --> 09:51.660
and operates just like any other toll bridge in America.

09:51.660 --> 09:56.860
But the private sector's encroachment into American infrastructure gets even more covert.

09:56.860 --> 10:01.020
Two hours to the northwest, a section of state highway was set for an upgrade to meet federal

10:01.020 --> 10:06.320
interstate standards and form a part of the New Mexico to Canada I-69, but the state hired

10:06.320 --> 10:10.520
a private company not only to build the road, but to operate it.

10:10.520 --> 10:16.320
The company issued $244 million in PABs to finance the construction, yet in this case,

10:16.320 --> 10:17.960
there are no tolls.

10:17.960 --> 10:21.800
From the public's perspective, this is an entirely free section of interstate that operates

10:21.800 --> 10:25.960
just like any other, but in the background, Indiana is paying it tens of millions per

10:25.960 --> 10:30.320
year in so-called availability payments for the company's work, allowing it to repay

10:30.320 --> 10:31.680
its bonds.

10:31.680 --> 10:37.040
Brightline is not many steps removed from that interstate or bridge or intermodal center.

10:37.040 --> 10:41.680
It's a private project, technically, but one that had little chance of ever happening

10:41.680 --> 10:44.240
without deep public sector support.

10:44.240 --> 10:49.680
Beyond myriad project approvals, Brightline financed its construction through $3 billion

10:49.680 --> 10:52.200
in tax-exempt private activity bonds.

10:52.200 --> 10:56.280
Now, this is not very different from a straight-up grant.

10:56.280 --> 11:01.060
The government has to approve PAB issuances, and foregone tax revenue costs them the same

11:01.060 --> 11:02.540
as an equivalent grant.

11:02.540 --> 11:06.960
So, in a long spectrum between fully private and fully public, you have a project like

11:06.960 --> 11:10.700
Louisville's new toll bridge sitting just over the line into the public side, and you

11:10.700 --> 11:15.720
have a project like Brightline just over the line into private, but both straddle the center

11:15.720 --> 11:18.020
of the public-private spectrum.

11:18.020 --> 11:23.460
Both are financing construction using tax-advantaged bonds, then recouping costs through user fees.

11:23.460 --> 11:27.100
There are some semantic distinctions that could be made based on who initiated the project

11:27.100 --> 11:31.540
or who owns the underlying infrastructure, but the critical difference, perhaps, is less

11:31.540 --> 11:36.900
so whether a project is or is not a public or private project, but rather what it's

11:36.900 --> 11:38.740
perceived as.

11:38.740 --> 11:43.300
All of recent history has demonstrated that there's no effective political will in America

11:43.300 --> 11:44.980
for passenger rail development.

11:44.980 --> 11:50.180
While it gets talked about constantly, nearly no meaningful progress has actually happened

11:50.180 --> 11:52.440
in the better part of a century.

11:52.440 --> 11:56.940
The common but almost entirely incorrect argument against this development is that there wouldn't

11:56.940 --> 12:01.000
be enough demand for widespread passenger rail in America due to lower population density

12:01.000 --> 12:05.080
and high car ownership rates, and therefore any service would operate at a loss, which

12:05.080 --> 12:07.380
would have to be paid for by the taxpayer.

12:07.380 --> 12:12.060
So, after decades of political gridlock against public rail projects in Florida, Brightline

12:12.060 --> 12:17.220
stepped in and argued that they could do the same, yet at no risk to the taxpayer—the

12:17.220 --> 12:20.660
public would get all the upside without any of the risk.

12:20.660 --> 12:23.600
This is almost true.

12:23.600 --> 12:28.720
Government activity bonds do minimize taxpayer risk, but they don't entirely eliminate

12:28.720 --> 12:29.720
it.

12:29.720 --> 12:34.480
The government only loses tax revenue if Brightline is successful because, in the alternate scenario,

12:34.480 --> 12:38.800
where the project is financed entirely by traditional private sector bonds, the government

12:38.800 --> 12:43.120
would not collect tax revenue if the company failed and investors didn't get repaid—they

12:43.120 --> 12:45.240
wouldn't have any taxable income.

12:45.240 --> 12:50.100
Therefore, on the surface level, this is effectively an ingenious type of grant that only incurs

12:50.100 --> 12:55.400
a cost when a project is successful, yet with essentially no downside risk.

12:55.400 --> 12:57.800
At least, that's what can be argued.

12:57.800 --> 13:00.820
In practice, it does get a bit more complicated than that.

13:00.820 --> 13:04.620
The institutional investors pouring money into Brightline bonds don't have an unlimited

13:04.620 --> 13:09.480
amount of money to invest, and therefore PABs inherently pull money away from traditional

13:09.480 --> 13:13.720
bonds and investments, and lead to reduced tax revenue due to less investment money in

13:13.720 --> 13:15.340
taxable investments.

13:15.340 --> 13:20.640
In addition, in cases when PAB-financed projects have gone wrong, it's not always the risk-free

13:20.640 --> 13:23.900
scenario that the politicians and project leaders promise it'll be.

13:23.900 --> 13:28.860
In the case of that section of I-69 in Indiana, the project failed.

13:28.860 --> 13:32.500
Mismandament led to massive cost overruns that made it clear that the concessionaire

13:32.500 --> 13:35.380
would not be able to pay back its bondholders.

13:35.380 --> 13:39.100
This was a problem to the state of Indiana because the varying interest rates offered

13:39.100 --> 13:43.940
by different bond issuers are essentially a market-defined indicator of risk—if a

13:43.940 --> 13:47.460
bond is issued by a financially trustworthy source, like the United States government,

13:47.460 --> 13:51.360
it'll have quite a low interest rate, while if it's issued by a source where the market

13:51.360 --> 13:55.820
has less confidence in survival through the term of the bond, like an upstart tech company,

13:55.820 --> 14:00.420
the issuer will have to offer a higher interest rate in order to entice investors to buy the

14:00.420 --> 14:01.420
bond.

14:01.420 --> 14:05.540
So, in Indiana's case, if this private company did not pay back their loans, it would get

14:05.540 --> 14:10.220
more expensive for public-private partnerships statewide to get financing, since this was

14:10.220 --> 14:14.780
an indicator that perhaps the state was bad at selecting project partners, and therefore

14:14.780 --> 14:19.140
that there was a higher risk with all public-private partnerships in the state.

14:19.140 --> 14:23.480
Therefore, the state stepped in, took over the project, and paid the bondholders back

14:23.480 --> 14:28.000
in full even though they were not legally responsible for those bonds—the incentives

14:28.000 --> 14:31.100
just made it make financial sense in the long term.

14:31.100 --> 14:35.360
But despite the more muddled reality of private activity bonds and public-private infrastructure

14:35.360 --> 14:39.800
projects more broadly, what matters most when it comes to the successful development of

14:39.800 --> 14:43.440
American passenger rail is perception.

14:43.440 --> 14:47.800
It is no wonder that the promise of a project that at worst would create jobs and pour money

14:47.800 --> 14:51.900
into the state before sputtering out, at best would create a transportation system the envy

14:51.900 --> 14:57.020
of the entire nation, and do either at no risk the taxpayer worked.

14:57.020 --> 15:03.540
And even if that message isn't 100% true, it is mostly true—enough that the nuance

15:03.540 --> 15:04.920
gets ignored.

15:04.920 --> 15:10.540
Increasingly, it appears that the Brightline model of American rail development is replicable.

15:10.540 --> 15:13.740
Elsewhere in the Sunbelt, there's Texas Central Railway.

15:13.740 --> 15:16.300
Its pitch is similar, yet loftier.

15:16.300 --> 15:20.560
It plans to develop a true high-speed line between Dallas and Houston using Japanese

15:20.560 --> 15:25.140
Shinkansen technology, offering 90-minute trips between two massive, wealthy cities

15:25.140 --> 15:28.120
currently separated by four hours of highway.

15:28.120 --> 15:31.720
In their decade or so of existence, they've made meaningful progress towards this, having

15:31.720 --> 15:36.280
raised hundreds of millions in capital, acquired plenty of land on the route, and surpassed

15:36.280 --> 15:38.620
multiple political, legal, and permitting hurdles.

15:38.620 --> 15:42.860
While in their early years Texas Central stayed consistent, insisting that funding would be

15:42.860 --> 15:47.860
100% private, in more recent years this messaging softened to open the door up to quiet public

15:47.860 --> 15:50.300
funding through mechanisms like PABs.

15:50.300 --> 15:54.780
In 2022, the company appeared to implode, with their CEO and key executives quietly

15:54.780 --> 15:59.000
announcing their departure with no notice or justification, and all assumed the ambitious

15:59.000 --> 16:03.940
venture was dead for good, yet in 2023 it showed signs of life through a short and ambiguous

16:03.940 --> 16:05.960
press release by Amtrak.

16:05.960 --> 16:09.960
The government-owned rail operator announced it had partnered with Texas Central to continue

16:09.960 --> 16:13.780
early-stage development, and this partnership has actually started to move forward as the

16:13.780 --> 16:18.500
pair was awarded a modest half-million dollar federal grant to continue their work.

16:18.500 --> 16:23.340
While still incredibly ambitious and far from likely to happen, this is at least a subtle

16:23.340 --> 16:28.460
indication that some in Washington identify the merits of a private-sector face to American

16:28.460 --> 16:33.140
passenger rail projects, no matter how public they may be in practice.

16:33.140 --> 16:37.520
And further west, Brightline itself, or at least an affiliated company with common ownership

16:37.520 --> 16:42.760
and branding, is copy and pasting their business model onto a new geography—Los Angeles to

16:42.760 --> 16:44.280
Las Vegas.

16:44.280 --> 16:48.520
Like their Florida route, this is a massive sunbelt travel corridor buoyed by tourism

16:48.520 --> 16:52.780
with relatively low construction costs, in this case due to the emptiness and flatness

16:52.780 --> 16:57.700
of the desert sitting between the two cities, rather than direct ownership of existing tracks.

16:57.700 --> 17:02.240
In this more progressive region, the company was able to find deeper public support and,

17:02.240 --> 17:06.720
in addition to billions of already approved PAB financing, the company was also awarded

17:06.720 --> 17:11.400
billions worth of state and federal grants, perhaps spurred on by the upcoming 2028 Olympics

17:11.400 --> 17:15.500
in Los Angeles and the company's bafflingly realistic promise to complete the project

17:15.500 --> 17:16.500
by then.

17:16.500 --> 17:20.560
So, Brightline West has become the second private passenger rail project in America

17:20.560 --> 17:26.760
in the 21st century to tilt into likelier-than-not to happen—so much so that the Biden administration

17:26.820 --> 17:29.420
is already taking credit for their role in it.

17:29.420 --> 17:33.060
Yet, the reason why Brightline's audacious claims of building a passenger rail service

17:33.060 --> 17:37.080
in four years, or even building its Florida service in the first place, were believable

17:37.080 --> 17:41.220
is because they're focusing on the absolute lowest-hanging fruit.

17:41.220 --> 17:45.500
They're developing service where there is just that perfect three- or four-hour travel

17:45.500 --> 17:50.180
time between two wealthy, touristy places, leading to high demand, mixed with perfect

17:50.180 --> 17:54.840
geography due to pre-existing rail alignments or its sparse landscape, leading to low construction

17:54.840 --> 17:55.840
costs.

17:55.920 --> 18:00.040
They're putting passenger trains where they have the absolute best chances of profitability,

18:00.040 --> 18:04.720
which is what any well-run private company would and should do.

18:04.720 --> 18:09.340
Perhaps the only problem with this is that that's what Amtrak should be doing.

18:09.340 --> 18:13.680
Effective passenger rail is not a business, but a public service.

18:13.680 --> 18:18.520
Roads are also a public service, meaning they're not built solely where they can turn a profit.

18:18.520 --> 18:22.720
If every road in America was converted to a fee-funded model, where users paid based

18:22.720 --> 18:27.240
on how much they used them, plenty of busy roads would be plenty profitable, yet plenty

18:27.240 --> 18:30.200
more roads would fail to pay for themselves.

18:30.200 --> 18:34.980
America doesn't operate roads on a fee-funded model—rather, taxpayer revenue is collected

18:34.980 --> 18:40.140
together to fund construction and maintenance overall, yet the same discrepancies exist.

18:40.140 --> 18:45.120
Some roads absolutely justify their costs directly, yet many more don't.

18:45.120 --> 18:49.540
The rural road connecting far-flung ranches to the city likely could never fund itself

18:49.540 --> 18:54.340
using a fee model, yet in the public service model the public accepts this loss because

18:54.340 --> 18:58.340
it's considered that this connectivity is worth it for the ranches to be able to deliver

18:58.340 --> 19:03.180
product to processors, for example, and getting product to processors easily is worth it for

19:03.180 --> 19:06.020
everyone as it lowers the cost of food.

19:06.020 --> 19:10.460
Effectively, the taxpayer who only uses the busy urban highway is paying more than their

19:10.460 --> 19:14.780
fair share to subsidize that rural road, and the public generally accepts this because

19:14.780 --> 19:17.700
connectivity is good for all.

19:17.700 --> 19:22.780
Other rail systems should operate under a similar ethos because the exact same principles

19:22.780 --> 19:23.900
arise.

19:23.900 --> 19:28.460
Any effective system should, and globally does, use the profits from high traffic and

19:28.460 --> 19:33.020
less expensive corridors to offset the losses from low traffic and more expensive ones since

19:33.020 --> 19:37.140
that nationwide connectivity does a lot more than just capture demand.

19:37.140 --> 19:41.480
It improves social and economic mobility, it grows the national economy, it does plenty

19:41.480 --> 19:45.480
that is worth it for the passengers that only ever take the high traffic line, justifying

19:45.480 --> 19:49.320
the profits from their trips to transfer to pay for the losses from another's.

19:49.320 --> 19:54.220
So, in a perfect world, Amtrak or another national rail operator would be reaping the

19:54.220 --> 19:58.780
profits from those Miami to Orlando or LA to Vegas trips and using them to run trains

19:58.780 --> 20:03.680
from Idaho Falls to Salt Lake City, but with each corridor that the private sector builds

20:03.680 --> 20:06.640
up, the potential of that perfect world diminishes.

20:06.640 --> 20:11.980
But of course, Amtrak and the government that has held it back have had decades to develop

20:11.980 --> 20:18.240
meaningful service on these routes, and have not, so the time is long past to argue that

20:18.240 --> 20:21.320
we should delay good to get great.

20:21.320 --> 20:25.000
But hopefully this good scenario can till public sentiment in a way that prevents such

20:25.000 --> 20:28.720
potent pushback against national, public sector rail development.

20:28.720 --> 20:35.860
Brightline, by all early measures, is a success—190,000 passengers rode the company's new Miami to

20:35.860 --> 20:40.760
Orlando service in its first 70 days of operation, and the monthly averages continue to climb

20:40.780 --> 20:45.060
as they've upped frequency to 16 trains in each direction each day.

20:45.060 --> 20:49.420
Also, after just a few years of operation, the company's West Palm Beach to Miami segment

20:49.420 --> 20:53.580
attained operational profitability with all indications suggesting that the long-distance

20:53.580 --> 20:56.740
segment to Orlando will follow in the coming years.

20:56.740 --> 21:00.940
This momentum seemingly pushed the affiliate company's western expansion into reality

21:00.940 --> 21:04.500
with far more public support than it received for its initial service.

21:04.500 --> 21:10.740
Now, if this is the start of an American passenger rail renaissance, it's truly just the out-of-the-box

21:11.720 --> 21:13.520
absolute tiniest of starts.

21:13.520 --> 21:17.680
The country has an unbelievably long way to go to catch up with the rest of the wealthy

21:17.680 --> 21:21.820
world, and many dominance need to fall in the right direction for these private sector

21:21.820 --> 21:24.320
projects to lead to widespread public good.

21:24.320 --> 21:28.920
But at the very least, it's a believable start—it's a moment that one could imagine

21:28.920 --> 21:36.980
looking back on as the small start that cascaded into a passenger rail renaissance.

21:37.000 --> 21:41.480
This new era of private passenger rail development is an indication of how powerfully tweaking

21:41.480 --> 21:45.040
the underlying business model of something can lead to different results.

21:45.040 --> 21:49.200
Amtrak and Brightline are both running trains, but Brightline's business model has allowed

21:49.200 --> 21:52.420
it to do it better, faster, and in more places.

21:52.420 --> 21:54.680
We had similar thoughts when we started Nebula.

21:54.680 --> 21:58.240
A bunch of us creators came together and started talking about how we could design a business

21:58.240 --> 22:01.680
model for a streaming site that would lead to the best content possible.

22:01.680 --> 22:03.600
To start with, we got rid of ads.

22:03.600 --> 22:07.260
It incentivized creators to chase clicks over creating the best, most meaningful videos,

22:07.260 --> 22:11.100
and they also lead to highly variable revenue for the creator, which makes it tougher to

22:11.100 --> 22:14.820
plan financially, so instead we went with a subscription model.

22:14.820 --> 22:19.020
This allows us to set aside a portion of our monthly revenue for content development itself,

22:19.020 --> 22:23.740
which is what funds Nebula Originals—big-budget, dream projects for creators that simply would

22:23.740 --> 22:25.880
not work financially on YouTube.

22:25.880 --> 22:29.460
Nebula recently released the Patrick Williams Holiday Special, including a guest appearance

22:29.460 --> 22:33.460
by me, the first couple episodes of Archaeology Quest by Real Science, and another Modern

22:33.460 --> 22:36.920
Conflicts video by RealLifeLore about the Lebanese Civil War.

22:36.920 --> 22:41.560
Nebula Originals are consistently great, and we spent much of 2023 working to develop the

22:41.560 --> 22:45.960
absolute best slate of releases for 2024 as possible, which are starting to come out at

22:45.960 --> 22:48.240
about the highest frequency we've ever had.

22:48.240 --> 22:52.360
In fact, we at Wendover are in production right now for our highest budget and most

22:52.360 --> 22:57.140
ambitious original to date, and for you jetlag fans, as you likely know, you can also watch

22:57.140 --> 23:00.240
every single episode of the show one week early on Nebula.

23:00.240 --> 23:05.280
So, in all, Nebula offers you, the viewer, an ad-free experience watching a curated group

23:05.280 --> 23:09.260
of a few hundred of the best, most thoughtful creators out there, plus big-budget originals

23:09.260 --> 23:13.280
by the same creators, and you get all of this for a surprisingly affordable price.

23:13.280 --> 23:18.800
When you sign up at our link, nebulatv.tv-slash-wendover, you'll get 40% off an annual subscription,

23:18.800 --> 23:22.960
which brings the cost down to the equivalent of just $2.50 a month.

23:22.960 --> 23:27.220
Wendover will even get a portion of that subscription fee for as long as you stay subscribed,

23:27.220 --> 23:29.740
so thanks in advance for signing up using our code.
