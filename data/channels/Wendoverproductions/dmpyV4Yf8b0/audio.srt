1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,560
If high-speed rail should work anywhere in America, it's here.

2
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:09,960
Below this line lives a population of nearly 20 million people—6.5 million in the Miami

3
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:15,760
metro area, 3 million in the Tampa metro, and another 2.5 million in the Orlando area.

4
00:00:15,760 --> 00:00:20,660
This massive population is relatively confined, by American standards, meaning it's dense

5
00:00:20,660 --> 00:00:24,260
and centralized enough to coalesce around a few stations.

6
00:00:24,260 --> 00:00:29,000
And with each of these three metro areas sitting within about 200 miles or 320 kilometers from

7
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:33,160
each other, they're close enough that flying is awkwardly involved, but far enough that

8
00:00:33,160 --> 00:00:35,980
fighting interstate traffic for hours is a pain.

9
00:00:35,980 --> 00:00:39,920
There are also plenty of reasons to move between these areas—there are the beaches along

10
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:44,080
the east coast, the businesses on the shores of Tampa Bay, the culture emanating out of

11
00:00:44,080 --> 00:00:49,280
Miami, and the entertainment of Orlando that each pull out-of-town tourists, in-state travelers,

12
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:52,800
and Floridian businesspeople alike from one city to the next.

13
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:57,920
And finally, geographically speaking, there's really little getting in the way of the rails—no

14
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:02,880
town ranges, no gaping canyons, no physical impediments that would require any great feat

15
00:01:02,880 --> 00:01:04,040
of engineering.

16
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:06,360
Of course, none of this is anything new.

17
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:10,960
As far back as the 80s, Floridians and federal planners alike have been scouring over maps,

18
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:15,500
calculating projections, and pitching the idea of connecting Tampa to Orlando to Miami

19
00:01:15,500 --> 00:01:20,360
with a train route that wouldn't cost the traveler a day, but a matter of hours.

20
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:24,000
But no public-private partnership could get it done in the 80s.

21
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Nor could they get it done in the 90s, nor the 2000s, nor, for that matter, the 2010s.

22
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,120
But not long after the most recent public-private partnership died on Governor Rick Scott's

23
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:40,740
desk in 2011 came another high-speed rail pitch—one equal parts exciting and far off.

24
00:01:40,740 --> 00:01:45,520
It was called All Aboard Florida—it launched in 2012, and projected that, at a cost of

25
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:51,040
a billion dollars, it'd be running a service from South Florida to Orlando by 2014.

26
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:54,820
Like those before it, All Aboard Florida blew through its initial cost estimate and

27
00:01:54,820 --> 00:02:00,840
far past its projected opening date, but unlike those before it, All Aboard Florida, now rebranded

28
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:06,720
as Brightline, actually opened for actual rail passengers in 2018.

29
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:11,480
Fast and fully private, it was the first of its kind in the US.

30
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:14,000
The initial service was modest.

31
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:18,960
Far from the vision of 230 miles or 370 kilometers of track connecting the major metro areas

32
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:23,720
of Central and South Florida, the deeply discounted $10 and $15 tickets offered on

33
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:29,000
January 13, 2018 could get a traveler not from Orlando to Miami, but the 40 minutes

34
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,160
from Fort Lauderdale to West Palm Beach.

35
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:35,920
And while service would soon expand to the 66 miles or 110 kilometers connecting West

36
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:41,460
Palm Beach and Miami, Brightline still wasn't offering a high-speed rail service, but rather

37
00:02:41,460 --> 00:02:47,280
a higher-speed service—not yet touching the 125-mile or 200-kilometer-per-hour high-speed

38
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:52,760
criteria, but maxing out at 79 miles or 130 kilometers per hour.

39
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:57,420
Still only running a 70-mile stretch at pedestrian speeds by the rest of the world's standards,

40
00:02:57,420 --> 00:03:03,640
Brightline opening to real-life customers in 2018 marked an extreme rarity in the US—a

41
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:09,960
new passenger rail project actually becoming a real-world reality.

42
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:14,480
High-speed or even higher-speed rail represents the ultimate long-term investment, and Brightline

43
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:15,480
is no exception.

44
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:20,080
Of course, Brightline, for its part, had some advantages—most notably the fact that its

45
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:24,480
parent company, Florida East Coast Industries, just so happened to be the owner of the Florida

46
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:26,240
East Coast Railway.

47
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:30,240
While other suitors would have to negotiate and lease a rail corridor, Brightline already

48
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:35,960
had access to the very railroad that had effectively built South Florida a century prior—but

49
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:39,580
having access to a rail corridor was only the first step.

50
00:03:39,580 --> 00:03:43,720
To run frequent and fast service, Brightline first had to build an entirely new second

51
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:47,740
set of rails along more than two-thirds of the 66-mile corridor.

52
00:03:47,740 --> 00:03:52,120
While straightforward enough, double-tracking takes time and money, and making this more

53
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:55,600
difficult were the rivers and canals the rail had to cross.

54
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:59,880
While each was already spanned by a bridge, nearly every bridge was only wide enough for

55
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:03,840
one set of rails, not two, so nearly all had to be replaced.

56
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:08,580
Then, in the sections where rail could be reused, there was the issue of alignment.

57
00:04:08,580 --> 00:04:12,000
To accommodate passenger trains moving at twice the speed of the freight trains for

58
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,920
which the rails had been designed, crews would need to manually move rail into more

59
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:18,860
gradual turns and straighter alignments.

60
00:04:18,860 --> 00:04:22,720
Just these rail alterations alone—not to mention all the signaling upgrades and siting

61
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:28,600
alterations—along just this section of rail represented three years of work by the company.

62
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:31,960
While readying the rails, Brightline needed stations, too.

63
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:35,660
It started with these three, building each from the ground up and negotiating agreements

64
00:04:35,660 --> 00:04:39,400
and connections with each municipality and their local mass transit system to connect

65
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:42,560
its inner-city rails with other intra-city options.

66
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:46,680
Each was designed to look modern and provide services beyond just a stop.

67
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:52,080
The crown jewel was the Miami Central Station, spanning some 9 acres or 4 city blocks and

68
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:57,400
housing elevated platforms, restaurants and shops, some 300 parking spots, and two 38-story

69
00:04:57,400 --> 00:04:59,920
towers holding 800 apartments.

70
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:03,800
Just to turn this into a serviceable routing, to provide an hour-and-15-minute trip from

71
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:10,040
Miami to West Palm Beach for somewhere around $20-50 each way, it took Brightline six years

72
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:14,100
of navigating everything from municipal and federal environmental impact statements to

73
00:05:14,100 --> 00:05:17,720
rail straightenings and multi-million dollar construction projects.

74
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:20,480
And that was just phase one.

75
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:25,580
Undaunted by delays or cost in the first place, Brightline began construction on a shining

76
00:05:25,580 --> 00:05:31,060
new station connected to the Orlando International Airport, and in the fall of 2023, service

77
00:05:31,060 --> 00:05:34,440
from Miami to Orlando opened to the public.

78
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:39,480
And Brightline isn't slowing down, as work on phase 3, from Orlando to Tampa, has already

79
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:40,480
begun.

80
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:45,320
But Brightline's biggest hurdle wasn't design, and it wasn't planning, and it wasn't

81
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:49,720
construction, because Brightline was not just another passenger rail project.

82
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:54,380
It was an American passenger rail project, and no matter how fiercely private it may

83
00:05:54,380 --> 00:05:59,700
insist it is, it wasn't going to get anywhere without a huge degree of political support,

84
00:05:59,700 --> 00:06:04,300
and that's tough to come by for passenger railways in America these days.

85
00:06:04,300 --> 00:06:06,560
But it tried a new technique.

86
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:12,140
Publicly, it portrayed itself as a fully private, capitalistic organization developing a service

87
00:06:12,140 --> 00:06:15,600
at the whim of the free market, at no risk to the taxpayer.

88
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:20,000
Privately, though, it worked closely with the state and federal government to finally

89
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,480
complete what politicians never could.

90
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:28,360
Buried deep in the 500s of the 4,000 or so pages of the Internal Revenue Service's tax

91
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:32,780
code is a series of sections setting strict parameters on a very particular financial

92
00:06:32,780 --> 00:06:39,800
mechanism known as private activity bonds, or PABs, and on page 555 in particular, one

93
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:48,060
line of Part A of Section 142 opens up high-speed intercity rail as eligible issuers of PABs.

94
00:06:48,060 --> 00:06:51,060
PABs are simple in concept.

95
00:06:51,060 --> 00:06:54,820
Companies regularly issue bonds to raise money for big projects that they think will turn

96
00:06:54,820 --> 00:06:59,380
a profit in the long term, but that require a huge amount of upfront investment.

97
00:06:59,380 --> 00:07:03,260
They pay the buyer back in installments, plus interest, so the company will end up paying

98
00:07:03,260 --> 00:07:07,080
more than the bond purchase price in sum, but through this they can reduce what they

99
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:10,140
need to pay annually to below their expected revenue.

100
00:07:10,140 --> 00:07:14,380
But as with any sort of earnings, the bond buyer has to pay taxes on the income generated

101
00:07:14,380 --> 00:07:19,220
by the bond's interest—unless they buy a government bond.

102
00:07:19,220 --> 00:07:23,440
Governments often issue tax-exempt bonds that still pay interest yet include the right

103
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:26,480
to not pay tax on that interest.

104
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:30,920
This allows the government to offer a lower-than-average interest rate, which saves them money, yet

105
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:35,360
still find bond buyers summing to the total they need since the lack of taxes offsets

106
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:36,760
the reduced interest income.

107
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:40,480
They're able to do this, of course, since they're also the authority in charge of

108
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:41,960
setting tax policy.

109
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:48,440
PABs, however, are an exceptional instance where non-government bonds qualify as tax-free,

110
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:50,660
but only if the government says so.

111
00:07:50,660 --> 00:07:54,300
The government will approve the issuance of a certain value's worth of PABs if they

112
00:07:54,300 --> 00:07:58,900
believe a private company is doing something in the public interest that they want to incentivize,

113
00:07:58,900 --> 00:08:01,460
such as passenger rail development.

114
00:08:01,460 --> 00:08:06,440
Following an expansion of eligibility and issuances in 2005, the private sector jumped

115
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:07,440
on the opportunity.

116
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:13,460
Centerpoint, for example, raised some $225 million through PABs to build the country's

117
00:08:13,460 --> 00:08:17,900
largest inland port near Chicago, acting as a massive connecting node between America's

118
00:08:17,900 --> 00:08:20,260
truck and rail freight networks.

119
00:08:20,260 --> 00:08:24,620
Using operating and selling intermodal logistics hubs like this is the bread and butter of

120
00:08:24,620 --> 00:08:29,940
what Centerpoint does, but this was an opportunity to do so at a discount and, in the federal

121
00:08:29,940 --> 00:08:33,660
government's eyes, forgoing the tens of millions of dollars of tax revenue was worth

122
00:08:33,660 --> 00:08:37,780
it to strengthen America's freight transportation network, even if it would be a profitable

123
00:08:37,780 --> 00:08:42,520
venture for a private enterprise, since improved freight logistics would likely raise the national

124
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:44,300
tax base overall.

125
00:08:44,620 --> 00:08:51,300
This is one of the most objectively private PAB-funded projects—others blur the lines.

126
00:08:51,300 --> 00:08:55,620
The greater Louisville, Kentucky area has long had chronic traffic problems, especially

127
00:08:55,620 --> 00:09:00,440
given its geography sitting on the massive Ohio River—there used to be incredible backups

128
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:04,600
to get to the Indiana side, and vice versa, so the two states and the federal government

129
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:08,500
decided they needed a bridge to its north to divert through traffic away from the city

130
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:11,620
by connecting two isolated sections of interstate.

131
00:09:11,620 --> 00:09:16,140
Now, this undertaking was planned and designed by the government, yet when it came time to

132
00:09:16,140 --> 00:09:21,020
actually build and operate this massive, costly bridge, the entire project was essentially

133
00:09:21,020 --> 00:09:27,040
handed over to a consortium formed by Vinci and BBGI—two massive, multinational infrastructure

134
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:28,340
investment firms.

135
00:09:28,340 --> 00:09:33,940
This consortium then, on the federal government's blessing, went and issued $677 million in

136
00:09:33,940 --> 00:09:38,380
private activity bonds to pay for the construction of the bridge, and now, with it open, they're

137
00:09:38,380 --> 00:09:42,380
paying these bonds back using the toll revenue they collect from a long-term operating agreement

138
00:09:42,380 --> 00:09:44,540
lasting till 2051.

139
00:09:44,540 --> 00:09:48,420
From the public's perspective, though, this isn't anything novel—the bridge looks

140
00:09:48,420 --> 00:09:51,660
and operates just like any other toll bridge in America.

141
00:09:51,660 --> 00:09:56,860
But the private sector's encroachment into American infrastructure gets even more covert.

142
00:09:56,860 --> 00:10:01,020
Two hours to the northwest, a section of state highway was set for an upgrade to meet federal

143
00:10:01,020 --> 00:10:06,320
interstate standards and form a part of the New Mexico to Canada I-69, but the state hired

144
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:10,520
a private company not only to build the road, but to operate it.

145
00:10:10,520 --> 00:10:16,320
The company issued $244 million in PABs to finance the construction, yet in this case,

146
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:17,960
there are no tolls.

147
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:21,800
From the public's perspective, this is an entirely free section of interstate that operates

148
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:25,960
just like any other, but in the background, Indiana is paying it tens of millions per

149
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:30,320
year in so-called availability payments for the company's work, allowing it to repay

150
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:31,680
its bonds.

151
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:37,040
Brightline is not many steps removed from that interstate or bridge or intermodal center.

152
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:41,680
It's a private project, technically, but one that had little chance of ever happening

153
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:44,240
without deep public sector support.

154
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:49,680
Beyond myriad project approvals, Brightline financed its construction through $3 billion

155
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:52,200
in tax-exempt private activity bonds.

156
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:56,280
Now, this is not very different from a straight-up grant.

157
00:10:56,280 --> 00:11:01,060
The government has to approve PAB issuances, and foregone tax revenue costs them the same

158
00:11:01,060 --> 00:11:02,540
as an equivalent grant.

159
00:11:02,540 --> 00:11:06,960
So, in a long spectrum between fully private and fully public, you have a project like

160
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:10,700
Louisville's new toll bridge sitting just over the line into the public side, and you

161
00:11:10,700 --> 00:11:15,720
have a project like Brightline just over the line into private, but both straddle the center

162
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:18,020
of the public-private spectrum.

163
00:11:18,020 --> 00:11:23,460
Both are financing construction using tax-advantaged bonds, then recouping costs through user fees.

164
00:11:23,460 --> 00:11:27,100
There are some semantic distinctions that could be made based on who initiated the project

165
00:11:27,100 --> 00:11:31,540
or who owns the underlying infrastructure, but the critical difference, perhaps, is less

166
00:11:31,540 --> 00:11:36,900
so whether a project is or is not a public or private project, but rather what it's

167
00:11:36,900 --> 00:11:38,740
perceived as.

168
00:11:38,740 --> 00:11:43,300
All of recent history has demonstrated that there's no effective political will in America

169
00:11:43,300 --> 00:11:44,980
for passenger rail development.

170
00:11:44,980 --> 00:11:50,180
While it gets talked about constantly, nearly no meaningful progress has actually happened

171
00:11:50,180 --> 00:11:52,440
in the better part of a century.

172
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:56,940
The common but almost entirely incorrect argument against this development is that there wouldn't

173
00:11:56,940 --> 00:12:01,000
be enough demand for widespread passenger rail in America due to lower population density

174
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:05,080
and high car ownership rates, and therefore any service would operate at a loss, which

175
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:07,380
would have to be paid for by the taxpayer.

176
00:12:07,380 --> 00:12:12,060
So, after decades of political gridlock against public rail projects in Florida, Brightline

177
00:12:12,060 --> 00:12:17,220
stepped in and argued that they could do the same, yet at no risk to the taxpayer—the

178
00:12:17,220 --> 00:12:20,660
public would get all the upside without any of the risk.

179
00:12:20,660 --> 00:12:23,600
This is almost true.

180
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:28,720
Government activity bonds do minimize taxpayer risk, but they don't entirely eliminate

181
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:29,720
it.

182
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:34,480
The government only loses tax revenue if Brightline is successful because, in the alternate scenario,

183
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:38,800
where the project is financed entirely by traditional private sector bonds, the government

184
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:43,120
would not collect tax revenue if the company failed and investors didn't get repaid—they

185
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:45,240
wouldn't have any taxable income.

186
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:50,100
Therefore, on the surface level, this is effectively an ingenious type of grant that only incurs

187
00:12:50,100 --> 00:12:55,400
a cost when a project is successful, yet with essentially no downside risk.

188
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:57,800
At least, that's what can be argued.

189
00:12:57,800 --> 00:13:00,820
In practice, it does get a bit more complicated than that.

190
00:13:00,820 --> 00:13:04,620
The institutional investors pouring money into Brightline bonds don't have an unlimited

191
00:13:04,620 --> 00:13:09,480
amount of money to invest, and therefore PABs inherently pull money away from traditional

192
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:13,720
bonds and investments, and lead to reduced tax revenue due to less investment money in

193
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:15,340
taxable investments.

194
00:13:15,340 --> 00:13:20,640
In addition, in cases when PAB-financed projects have gone wrong, it's not always the risk-free

195
00:13:20,640 --> 00:13:23,900
scenario that the politicians and project leaders promise it'll be.

196
00:13:23,900 --> 00:13:28,860
In the case of that section of I-69 in Indiana, the project failed.

197
00:13:28,860 --> 00:13:32,500
Mismandament led to massive cost overruns that made it clear that the concessionaire

198
00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:35,380
would not be able to pay back its bondholders.

199
00:13:35,380 --> 00:13:39,100
This was a problem to the state of Indiana because the varying interest rates offered

200
00:13:39,100 --> 00:13:43,940
by different bond issuers are essentially a market-defined indicator of risk—if a

201
00:13:43,940 --> 00:13:47,460
bond is issued by a financially trustworthy source, like the United States government,

202
00:13:47,460 --> 00:13:51,360
it'll have quite a low interest rate, while if it's issued by a source where the market

203
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:55,820
has less confidence in survival through the term of the bond, like an upstart tech company,

204
00:13:55,820 --> 00:14:00,420
the issuer will have to offer a higher interest rate in order to entice investors to buy the

205
00:14:00,420 --> 00:14:01,420
bond.

206
00:14:01,420 --> 00:14:05,540
So, in Indiana's case, if this private company did not pay back their loans, it would get

207
00:14:05,540 --> 00:14:10,220
more expensive for public-private partnerships statewide to get financing, since this was

208
00:14:10,220 --> 00:14:14,780
an indicator that perhaps the state was bad at selecting project partners, and therefore

209
00:14:14,780 --> 00:14:19,140
that there was a higher risk with all public-private partnerships in the state.

210
00:14:19,140 --> 00:14:23,480
Therefore, the state stepped in, took over the project, and paid the bondholders back

211
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:28,000
in full even though they were not legally responsible for those bonds—the incentives

212
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:31,100
just made it make financial sense in the long term.

213
00:14:31,100 --> 00:14:35,360
But despite the more muddled reality of private activity bonds and public-private infrastructure

214
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:39,800
projects more broadly, what matters most when it comes to the successful development of

215
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:43,440
American passenger rail is perception.

216
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:47,800
It is no wonder that the promise of a project that at worst would create jobs and pour money

217
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:51,900
into the state before sputtering out, at best would create a transportation system the envy

218
00:14:51,900 --> 00:14:57,020
of the entire nation, and do either at no risk the taxpayer worked.

219
00:14:57,020 --> 00:15:03,540
And even if that message isn't 100% true, it is mostly true—enough that the nuance

220
00:15:03,540 --> 00:15:04,920
gets ignored.

221
00:15:04,920 --> 00:15:10,540
Increasingly, it appears that the Brightline model of American rail development is replicable.

222
00:15:10,540 --> 00:15:13,740
Elsewhere in the Sunbelt, there's Texas Central Railway.

223
00:15:13,740 --> 00:15:16,300
Its pitch is similar, yet loftier.

224
00:15:16,300 --> 00:15:20,560
It plans to develop a true high-speed line between Dallas and Houston using Japanese

225
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:25,140
Shinkansen technology, offering 90-minute trips between two massive, wealthy cities

226
00:15:25,140 --> 00:15:28,120
currently separated by four hours of highway.

227
00:15:28,120 --> 00:15:31,720
In their decade or so of existence, they've made meaningful progress towards this, having

228
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:36,280
raised hundreds of millions in capital, acquired plenty of land on the route, and surpassed

229
00:15:36,280 --> 00:15:38,620
multiple political, legal, and permitting hurdles.

230
00:15:38,620 --> 00:15:42,860
While in their early years Texas Central stayed consistent, insisting that funding would be

231
00:15:42,860 --> 00:15:47,860
100% private, in more recent years this messaging softened to open the door up to quiet public

232
00:15:47,860 --> 00:15:50,300
funding through mechanisms like PABs.

233
00:15:50,300 --> 00:15:54,780
In 2022, the company appeared to implode, with their CEO and key executives quietly

234
00:15:54,780 --> 00:15:59,000
announcing their departure with no notice or justification, and all assumed the ambitious

235
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:03,940
venture was dead for good, yet in 2023 it showed signs of life through a short and ambiguous

236
00:16:03,940 --> 00:16:05,960
press release by Amtrak.

237
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:09,960
The government-owned rail operator announced it had partnered with Texas Central to continue

238
00:16:09,960 --> 00:16:13,780
early-stage development, and this partnership has actually started to move forward as the

239
00:16:13,780 --> 00:16:18,500
pair was awarded a modest half-million dollar federal grant to continue their work.

240
00:16:18,500 --> 00:16:23,340
While still incredibly ambitious and far from likely to happen, this is at least a subtle

241
00:16:23,340 --> 00:16:28,460
indication that some in Washington identify the merits of a private-sector face to American

242
00:16:28,460 --> 00:16:33,140
passenger rail projects, no matter how public they may be in practice.

243
00:16:33,140 --> 00:16:37,520
And further west, Brightline itself, or at least an affiliated company with common ownership

244
00:16:37,520 --> 00:16:42,760
and branding, is copy and pasting their business model onto a new geography—Los Angeles to

245
00:16:42,760 --> 00:16:44,280
Las Vegas.

246
00:16:44,280 --> 00:16:48,520
Like their Florida route, this is a massive sunbelt travel corridor buoyed by tourism

247
00:16:48,520 --> 00:16:52,780
with relatively low construction costs, in this case due to the emptiness and flatness

248
00:16:52,780 --> 00:16:57,700
of the desert sitting between the two cities, rather than direct ownership of existing tracks.

249
00:16:57,700 --> 00:17:02,240
In this more progressive region, the company was able to find deeper public support and,

250
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:06,720
in addition to billions of already approved PAB financing, the company was also awarded

251
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:11,400
billions worth of state and federal grants, perhaps spurred on by the upcoming 2028 Olympics

252
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:15,500
in Los Angeles and the company's bafflingly realistic promise to complete the project

253
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:16,500
by then.

254
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:20,560
So, Brightline West has become the second private passenger rail project in America

255
00:17:20,560 --> 00:17:26,760
in the 21st century to tilt into likelier-than-not to happen—so much so that the Biden administration

256
00:17:26,820 --> 00:17:29,420
is already taking credit for their role in it.

257
00:17:29,420 --> 00:17:33,060
Yet, the reason why Brightline's audacious claims of building a passenger rail service

258
00:17:33,060 --> 00:17:37,080
in four years, or even building its Florida service in the first place, were believable

259
00:17:37,080 --> 00:17:41,220
is because they're focusing on the absolute lowest-hanging fruit.

260
00:17:41,220 --> 00:17:45,500
They're developing service where there is just that perfect three- or four-hour travel

261
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:50,180
time between two wealthy, touristy places, leading to high demand, mixed with perfect

262
00:17:50,180 --> 00:17:54,840
geography due to pre-existing rail alignments or its sparse landscape, leading to low construction

263
00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:55,840
costs.

264
00:17:55,920 --> 00:18:00,040
They're putting passenger trains where they have the absolute best chances of profitability,

265
00:18:00,040 --> 00:18:04,720
which is what any well-run private company would and should do.

266
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:09,340
Perhaps the only problem with this is that that's what Amtrak should be doing.

267
00:18:09,340 --> 00:18:13,680
Effective passenger rail is not a business, but a public service.

268
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:18,520
Roads are also a public service, meaning they're not built solely where they can turn a profit.

269
00:18:18,520 --> 00:18:22,720
If every road in America was converted to a fee-funded model, where users paid based

270
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:27,240
on how much they used them, plenty of busy roads would be plenty profitable, yet plenty

271
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:30,200
more roads would fail to pay for themselves.

272
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:34,980
America doesn't operate roads on a fee-funded model—rather, taxpayer revenue is collected

273
00:18:34,980 --> 00:18:40,140
together to fund construction and maintenance overall, yet the same discrepancies exist.

274
00:18:40,140 --> 00:18:45,120
Some roads absolutely justify their costs directly, yet many more don't.

275
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:49,540
The rural road connecting far-flung ranches to the city likely could never fund itself

276
00:18:49,540 --> 00:18:54,340
using a fee model, yet in the public service model the public accepts this loss because

277
00:18:54,340 --> 00:18:58,340
it's considered that this connectivity is worth it for the ranches to be able to deliver

278
00:18:58,340 --> 00:19:03,180
product to processors, for example, and getting product to processors easily is worth it for

279
00:19:03,180 --> 00:19:06,020
everyone as it lowers the cost of food.

280
00:19:06,020 --> 00:19:10,460
Effectively, the taxpayer who only uses the busy urban highway is paying more than their

281
00:19:10,460 --> 00:19:14,780
fair share to subsidize that rural road, and the public generally accepts this because

282
00:19:14,780 --> 00:19:17,700
connectivity is good for all.

283
00:19:17,700 --> 00:19:22,780
Other rail systems should operate under a similar ethos because the exact same principles

284
00:19:22,780 --> 00:19:23,900
arise.

285
00:19:23,900 --> 00:19:28,460
Any effective system should, and globally does, use the profits from high traffic and

286
00:19:28,460 --> 00:19:33,020
less expensive corridors to offset the losses from low traffic and more expensive ones since

287
00:19:33,020 --> 00:19:37,140
that nationwide connectivity does a lot more than just capture demand.

288
00:19:37,140 --> 00:19:41,480
It improves social and economic mobility, it grows the national economy, it does plenty

289
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:45,480
that is worth it for the passengers that only ever take the high traffic line, justifying

290
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:49,320
the profits from their trips to transfer to pay for the losses from another's.

291
00:19:49,320 --> 00:19:54,220
So, in a perfect world, Amtrak or another national rail operator would be reaping the

292
00:19:54,220 --> 00:19:58,780
profits from those Miami to Orlando or LA to Vegas trips and using them to run trains

293
00:19:58,780 --> 00:20:03,680
from Idaho Falls to Salt Lake City, but with each corridor that the private sector builds

294
00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:06,640
up, the potential of that perfect world diminishes.

295
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:11,980
But of course, Amtrak and the government that has held it back have had decades to develop

296
00:20:11,980 --> 00:20:18,240
meaningful service on these routes, and have not, so the time is long past to argue that

297
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:21,320
we should delay good to get great.

298
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:25,000
But hopefully this good scenario can till public sentiment in a way that prevents such

299
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:28,720
potent pushback against national, public sector rail development.

300
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:35,860
Brightline, by all early measures, is a success—190,000 passengers rode the company's new Miami to

301
00:20:35,860 --> 00:20:40,760
Orlando service in its first 70 days of operation, and the monthly averages continue to climb

302
00:20:40,780 --> 00:20:45,060
as they've upped frequency to 16 trains in each direction each day.

303
00:20:45,060 --> 00:20:49,420
Also, after just a few years of operation, the company's West Palm Beach to Miami segment

304
00:20:49,420 --> 00:20:53,580
attained operational profitability with all indications suggesting that the long-distance

305
00:20:53,580 --> 00:20:56,740
segment to Orlando will follow in the coming years.

306
00:20:56,740 --> 00:21:00,940
This momentum seemingly pushed the affiliate company's western expansion into reality

307
00:21:00,940 --> 00:21:04,500
with far more public support than it received for its initial service.

308
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:10,740
Now, if this is the start of an American passenger rail renaissance, it's truly just the out-of-the-box

309
00:21:11,720 --> 00:21:13,520
absolute tiniest of starts.

310
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:17,680
The country has an unbelievably long way to go to catch up with the rest of the wealthy

311
00:21:17,680 --> 00:21:21,820
world, and many dominance need to fall in the right direction for these private sector

312
00:21:21,820 --> 00:21:24,320
projects to lead to widespread public good.

313
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:28,920
But at the very least, it's a believable start—it's a moment that one could imagine

314
00:21:28,920 --> 00:21:36,980
looking back on as the small start that cascaded into a passenger rail renaissance.

315
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:41,480
This new era of private passenger rail development is an indication of how powerfully tweaking

316
00:21:41,480 --> 00:21:45,040
the underlying business model of something can lead to different results.

317
00:21:45,040 --> 00:21:49,200
Amtrak and Brightline are both running trains, but Brightline's business model has allowed

318
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:52,420
it to do it better, faster, and in more places.

319
00:21:52,420 --> 00:21:54,680
We had similar thoughts when we started Nebula.

320
00:21:54,680 --> 00:21:58,240
A bunch of us creators came together and started talking about how we could design a business

321
00:21:58,240 --> 00:22:01,680
model for a streaming site that would lead to the best content possible.

322
00:22:01,680 --> 00:22:03,600
To start with, we got rid of ads.

323
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:07,260
It incentivized creators to chase clicks over creating the best, most meaningful videos,

324
00:22:07,260 --> 00:22:11,100
and they also lead to highly variable revenue for the creator, which makes it tougher to

325
00:22:11,100 --> 00:22:14,820
plan financially, so instead we went with a subscription model.

326
00:22:14,820 --> 00:22:19,020
This allows us to set aside a portion of our monthly revenue for content development itself,

327
00:22:19,020 --> 00:22:23,740
which is what funds Nebula Originals—big-budget, dream projects for creators that simply would

328
00:22:23,740 --> 00:22:25,880
not work financially on YouTube.

329
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:29,460
Nebula recently released the Patrick Williams Holiday Special, including a guest appearance

330
00:22:29,460 --> 00:22:33,460
by me, the first couple episodes of Archaeology Quest by Real Science, and another Modern

331
00:22:33,460 --> 00:22:36,920
Conflicts video by RealLifeLore about the Lebanese Civil War.

332
00:22:36,920 --> 00:22:41,560
Nebula Originals are consistently great, and we spent much of 2023 working to develop the

333
00:22:41,560 --> 00:22:45,960
absolute best slate of releases for 2024 as possible, which are starting to come out at

334
00:22:45,960 --> 00:22:48,240
about the highest frequency we've ever had.

335
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:52,360
In fact, we at Wendover are in production right now for our highest budget and most

336
00:22:52,360 --> 00:22:57,140
ambitious original to date, and for you jetlag fans, as you likely know, you can also watch

337
00:22:57,140 --> 00:23:00,240
every single episode of the show one week early on Nebula.

338
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:05,280
So, in all, Nebula offers you, the viewer, an ad-free experience watching a curated group

339
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:09,260
of a few hundred of the best, most thoughtful creators out there, plus big-budget originals

340
00:23:09,260 --> 00:23:13,280
by the same creators, and you get all of this for a surprisingly affordable price.

341
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:18,800
