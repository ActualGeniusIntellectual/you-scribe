0	4560	If high-speed rail should work anywhere in America, it's here.
4560	9960	Below this line lives a population of nearly 20 million people—6.5 million in the Miami
9960	15760	metro area, 3 million in the Tampa metro, and another 2.5 million in the Orlando area.
15760	20660	This massive population is relatively confined, by American standards, meaning it's dense
20660	24260	and centralized enough to coalesce around a few stations.
24260	29000	And with each of these three metro areas sitting within about 200 miles or 320 kilometers from
29000	33160	each other, they're close enough that flying is awkwardly involved, but far enough that
33160	35980	fighting interstate traffic for hours is a pain.
35980	39920	There are also plenty of reasons to move between these areas—there are the beaches along
39920	44080	the east coast, the businesses on the shores of Tampa Bay, the culture emanating out of
44080	49280	Miami, and the entertainment of Orlando that each pull out-of-town tourists, in-state travelers,
49280	52800	and Floridian businesspeople alike from one city to the next.
52800	57920	And finally, geographically speaking, there's really little getting in the way of the rails—no
57920	62880	town ranges, no gaping canyons, no physical impediments that would require any great feat
62880	64040	of engineering.
64040	66360	Of course, none of this is anything new.
66360	70960	As far back as the 80s, Floridians and federal planners alike have been scouring over maps,
70960	75500	calculating projections, and pitching the idea of connecting Tampa to Orlando to Miami
75500	80360	with a train route that wouldn't cost the traveler a day, but a matter of hours.
80360	84000	But no public-private partnership could get it done in the 80s.
84000	90000	Nor could they get it done in the 90s, nor the 2000s, nor, for that matter, the 2010s.
90000	94120	But not long after the most recent public-private partnership died on Governor Rick Scott's
94120	100740	desk in 2011 came another high-speed rail pitch—one equal parts exciting and far off.
100740	105520	It was called All Aboard Florida—it launched in 2012, and projected that, at a cost of
105520	111040	a billion dollars, it'd be running a service from South Florida to Orlando by 2014.
111040	114820	Like those before it, All Aboard Florida blew through its initial cost estimate and
114820	120840	far past its projected opening date, but unlike those before it, All Aboard Florida, now rebranded
120840	126720	as Brightline, actually opened for actual rail passengers in 2018.
126720	131480	Fast and fully private, it was the first of its kind in the US.
131480	134000	The initial service was modest.
134000	138960	Far from the vision of 230 miles or 370 kilometers of track connecting the major metro areas
138960	143720	of Central and South Florida, the deeply discounted $10 and $15 tickets offered on
143720	149000	January 13, 2018 could get a traveler not from Orlando to Miami, but the 40 minutes
149000	151160	from Fort Lauderdale to West Palm Beach.
151160	155920	And while service would soon expand to the 66 miles or 110 kilometers connecting West
155920	161460	Palm Beach and Miami, Brightline still wasn't offering a high-speed rail service, but rather
161460	167280	a higher-speed service—not yet touching the 125-mile or 200-kilometer-per-hour high-speed
167280	172760	criteria, but maxing out at 79 miles or 130 kilometers per hour.
172760	177420	Still only running a 70-mile stretch at pedestrian speeds by the rest of the world's standards,
177420	183640	Brightline opening to real-life customers in 2018 marked an extreme rarity in the US—a
183640	189960	new passenger rail project actually becoming a real-world reality.
189960	194480	High-speed or even higher-speed rail represents the ultimate long-term investment, and Brightline
194480	195480	is no exception.
195680	200080	Of course, Brightline, for its part, had some advantages—most notably the fact that its
200080	204480	parent company, Florida East Coast Industries, just so happened to be the owner of the Florida
204480	206240	East Coast Railway.
206240	210240	While other suitors would have to negotiate and lease a rail corridor, Brightline already
210240	215960	had access to the very railroad that had effectively built South Florida a century prior—but
215960	219580	having access to a rail corridor was only the first step.
219580	223720	To run frequent and fast service, Brightline first had to build an entirely new second
223720	227740	set of rails along more than two-thirds of the 66-mile corridor.
227740	232120	While straightforward enough, double-tracking takes time and money, and making this more
232120	235600	difficult were the rivers and canals the rail had to cross.
235600	239880	While each was already spanned by a bridge, nearly every bridge was only wide enough for
239880	243840	one set of rails, not two, so nearly all had to be replaced.
243840	248580	Then, in the sections where rail could be reused, there was the issue of alignment.
248580	252000	To accommodate passenger trains moving at twice the speed of the freight trains for
252000	255920	which the rails had been designed, crews would need to manually move rail into more
255920	258860	gradual turns and straighter alignments.
258860	262720	Just these rail alterations alone—not to mention all the signaling upgrades and siting
262720	268600	alterations—along just this section of rail represented three years of work by the company.
268600	271960	While readying the rails, Brightline needed stations, too.
271960	275660	It started with these three, building each from the ground up and negotiating agreements
275660	279400	and connections with each municipality and their local mass transit system to connect
279400	282560	its inner-city rails with other intra-city options.
282560	286680	Each was designed to look modern and provide services beyond just a stop.
286680	292080	The crown jewel was the Miami Central Station, spanning some 9 acres or 4 city blocks and
292080	297400	housing elevated platforms, restaurants and shops, some 300 parking spots, and two 38-story
297400	299920	towers holding 800 apartments.
299920	303800	Just to turn this into a serviceable routing, to provide an hour-and-15-minute trip from
303800	310040	Miami to West Palm Beach for somewhere around $20-50 each way, it took Brightline six years
310040	314100	of navigating everything from municipal and federal environmental impact statements to
314100	317720	rail straightenings and multi-million dollar construction projects.
317720	320480	And that was just phase one.
320480	325580	Undaunted by delays or cost in the first place, Brightline began construction on a shining
325580	331060	new station connected to the Orlando International Airport, and in the fall of 2023, service
331060	334440	from Miami to Orlando opened to the public.
334440	339480	And Brightline isn't slowing down, as work on phase 3, from Orlando to Tampa, has already
339480	340480	begun.
340480	345320	But Brightline's biggest hurdle wasn't design, and it wasn't planning, and it wasn't
345320	349720	construction, because Brightline was not just another passenger rail project.
349720	354380	It was an American passenger rail project, and no matter how fiercely private it may
354380	359700	insist it is, it wasn't going to get anywhere without a huge degree of political support,
359700	364300	and that's tough to come by for passenger railways in America these days.
364300	366560	But it tried a new technique.
366560	372140	Publicly, it portrayed itself as a fully private, capitalistic organization developing a service
372140	375600	at the whim of the free market, at no risk to the taxpayer.
375600	380000	Privately, though, it worked closely with the state and federal government to finally
380000	383480	complete what politicians never could.
383480	388360	Buried deep in the 500s of the 4,000 or so pages of the Internal Revenue Service's tax
388360	392780	code is a series of sections setting strict parameters on a very particular financial
392780	399800	mechanism known as private activity bonds, or PABs, and on page 555 in particular, one
399800	408060	line of Part A of Section 142 opens up high-speed intercity rail as eligible issuers of PABs.
408060	411060	PABs are simple in concept.
411060	414820	Companies regularly issue bonds to raise money for big projects that they think will turn
414820	419380	a profit in the long term, but that require a huge amount of upfront investment.
419380	423260	They pay the buyer back in installments, plus interest, so the company will end up paying
423260	427080	more than the bond purchase price in sum, but through this they can reduce what they
427080	430140	need to pay annually to below their expected revenue.
430140	434380	But as with any sort of earnings, the bond buyer has to pay taxes on the income generated
434380	439220	by the bond's interest—unless they buy a government bond.
439220	443440	Governments often issue tax-exempt bonds that still pay interest yet include the right
443440	446480	to not pay tax on that interest.
446480	450920	This allows the government to offer a lower-than-average interest rate, which saves them money, yet
450920	455360	still find bond buyers summing to the total they need since the lack of taxes offsets
455360	456760	the reduced interest income.
456760	460480	They're able to do this, of course, since they're also the authority in charge of
460480	461960	setting tax policy.
461960	468440	PABs, however, are an exceptional instance where non-government bonds qualify as tax-free,
468440	470660	but only if the government says so.
470660	474300	The government will approve the issuance of a certain value's worth of PABs if they
474300	478900	believe a private company is doing something in the public interest that they want to incentivize,
478900	481460	such as passenger rail development.
481460	486440	Following an expansion of eligibility and issuances in 2005, the private sector jumped
486440	487440	on the opportunity.
487440	493460	Centerpoint, for example, raised some $225 million through PABs to build the country's
493460	497900	largest inland port near Chicago, acting as a massive connecting node between America's
497900	500260	truck and rail freight networks.
500260	504620	Using operating and selling intermodal logistics hubs like this is the bread and butter of
504620	509940	what Centerpoint does, but this was an opportunity to do so at a discount and, in the federal
509940	513660	government's eyes, forgoing the tens of millions of dollars of tax revenue was worth
513660	517780	it to strengthen America's freight transportation network, even if it would be a profitable
517780	522520	venture for a private enterprise, since improved freight logistics would likely raise the national
522520	524300	tax base overall.
524620	531300	This is one of the most objectively private PAB-funded projects—others blur the lines.
531300	535620	The greater Louisville, Kentucky area has long had chronic traffic problems, especially
535620	540440	given its geography sitting on the massive Ohio River—there used to be incredible backups
540440	544600	to get to the Indiana side, and vice versa, so the two states and the federal government
544600	548500	decided they needed a bridge to its north to divert through traffic away from the city
548500	551620	by connecting two isolated sections of interstate.
551620	556140	Now, this undertaking was planned and designed by the government, yet when it came time to
556140	561020	actually build and operate this massive, costly bridge, the entire project was essentially
561020	567040	handed over to a consortium formed by Vinci and BBGI—two massive, multinational infrastructure
567040	568340	investment firms.
568340	573940	This consortium then, on the federal government's blessing, went and issued $677 million in
573940	578380	private activity bonds to pay for the construction of the bridge, and now, with it open, they're
578380	582380	paying these bonds back using the toll revenue they collect from a long-term operating agreement
582380	584540	lasting till 2051.
584540	588420	From the public's perspective, though, this isn't anything novel—the bridge looks
588420	591660	and operates just like any other toll bridge in America.
591660	596860	But the private sector's encroachment into American infrastructure gets even more covert.
596860	601020	Two hours to the northwest, a section of state highway was set for an upgrade to meet federal
601020	606320	interstate standards and form a part of the New Mexico to Canada I-69, but the state hired
606320	610520	a private company not only to build the road, but to operate it.
610520	616320	The company issued $244 million in PABs to finance the construction, yet in this case,
616320	617960	there are no tolls.
617960	621800	From the public's perspective, this is an entirely free section of interstate that operates
621800	625960	just like any other, but in the background, Indiana is paying it tens of millions per
625960	630320	year in so-called availability payments for the company's work, allowing it to repay
630320	631680	its bonds.
631680	637040	Brightline is not many steps removed from that interstate or bridge or intermodal center.
637040	641680	It's a private project, technically, but one that had little chance of ever happening
641680	644240	without deep public sector support.
644240	649680	Beyond myriad project approvals, Brightline financed its construction through $3 billion
649680	652200	in tax-exempt private activity bonds.
652200	656280	Now, this is not very different from a straight-up grant.
656280	661060	The government has to approve PAB issuances, and foregone tax revenue costs them the same
661060	662540	as an equivalent grant.
662540	666960	So, in a long spectrum between fully private and fully public, you have a project like
666960	670700	Louisville's new toll bridge sitting just over the line into the public side, and you
670700	675720	have a project like Brightline just over the line into private, but both straddle the center
675720	678020	of the public-private spectrum.
678020	683460	Both are financing construction using tax-advantaged bonds, then recouping costs through user fees.
683460	687100	There are some semantic distinctions that could be made based on who initiated the project
687100	691540	or who owns the underlying infrastructure, but the critical difference, perhaps, is less
691540	696900	so whether a project is or is not a public or private project, but rather what it's
696900	698740	perceived as.
698740	703300	All of recent history has demonstrated that there's no effective political will in America
703300	704980	for passenger rail development.
704980	710180	While it gets talked about constantly, nearly no meaningful progress has actually happened
710180	712440	in the better part of a century.
712440	716940	The common but almost entirely incorrect argument against this development is that there wouldn't
716940	721000	be enough demand for widespread passenger rail in America due to lower population density
721000	725080	and high car ownership rates, and therefore any service would operate at a loss, which
725080	727380	would have to be paid for by the taxpayer.
727380	732060	So, after decades of political gridlock against public rail projects in Florida, Brightline
732060	737220	stepped in and argued that they could do the same, yet at no risk to the taxpayer—the
737220	740660	public would get all the upside without any of the risk.
740660	743600	This is almost true.
743600	748720	Government activity bonds do minimize taxpayer risk, but they don't entirely eliminate
748720	749720	it.
749720	754480	The government only loses tax revenue if Brightline is successful because, in the alternate scenario,
754480	758800	where the project is financed entirely by traditional private sector bonds, the government
758800	763120	would not collect tax revenue if the company failed and investors didn't get repaid—they
763120	765240	wouldn't have any taxable income.
765240	770100	Therefore, on the surface level, this is effectively an ingenious type of grant that only incurs
770100	775400	a cost when a project is successful, yet with essentially no downside risk.
775400	777800	At least, that's what can be argued.
777800	780820	In practice, it does get a bit more complicated than that.
780820	784620	The institutional investors pouring money into Brightline bonds don't have an unlimited
784620	789480	amount of money to invest, and therefore PABs inherently pull money away from traditional
789480	793720	bonds and investments, and lead to reduced tax revenue due to less investment money in
793720	795340	taxable investments.
795340	800640	In addition, in cases when PAB-financed projects have gone wrong, it's not always the risk-free
800640	803900	scenario that the politicians and project leaders promise it'll be.
803900	808860	In the case of that section of I-69 in Indiana, the project failed.
808860	812500	Mismandament led to massive cost overruns that made it clear that the concessionaire
812500	815380	would not be able to pay back its bondholders.
815380	819100	This was a problem to the state of Indiana because the varying interest rates offered
819100	823940	by different bond issuers are essentially a market-defined indicator of risk—if a
823940	827460	bond is issued by a financially trustworthy source, like the United States government,
827460	831360	it'll have quite a low interest rate, while if it's issued by a source where the market
831360	835820	has less confidence in survival through the term of the bond, like an upstart tech company,
835820	840420	the issuer will have to offer a higher interest rate in order to entice investors to buy the
840420	841420	bond.
841420	845540	So, in Indiana's case, if this private company did not pay back their loans, it would get
845540	850220	more expensive for public-private partnerships statewide to get financing, since this was
850220	854780	an indicator that perhaps the state was bad at selecting project partners, and therefore
854780	859140	that there was a higher risk with all public-private partnerships in the state.
859140	863480	Therefore, the state stepped in, took over the project, and paid the bondholders back
863480	868000	in full even though they were not legally responsible for those bonds—the incentives
868000	871100	just made it make financial sense in the long term.
871100	875360	But despite the more muddled reality of private activity bonds and public-private infrastructure
875360	879800	projects more broadly, what matters most when it comes to the successful development of
879800	883440	American passenger rail is perception.
883440	887800	It is no wonder that the promise of a project that at worst would create jobs and pour money
887800	891900	into the state before sputtering out, at best would create a transportation system the envy
891900	897020	of the entire nation, and do either at no risk the taxpayer worked.
897020	903540	And even if that message isn't 100% true, it is mostly true—enough that the nuance
903540	904920	gets ignored.
904920	910540	Increasingly, it appears that the Brightline model of American rail development is replicable.
910540	913740	Elsewhere in the Sunbelt, there's Texas Central Railway.
913740	916300	Its pitch is similar, yet loftier.
916300	920560	It plans to develop a true high-speed line between Dallas and Houston using Japanese
920560	925140	Shinkansen technology, offering 90-minute trips between two massive, wealthy cities
925140	928120	currently separated by four hours of highway.
928120	931720	In their decade or so of existence, they've made meaningful progress towards this, having
931720	936280	raised hundreds of millions in capital, acquired plenty of land on the route, and surpassed
936280	938620	multiple political, legal, and permitting hurdles.
938620	942860	While in their early years Texas Central stayed consistent, insisting that funding would be
942860	947860	100% private, in more recent years this messaging softened to open the door up to quiet public
947860	950300	funding through mechanisms like PABs.
950300	954780	In 2022, the company appeared to implode, with their CEO and key executives quietly
954780	959000	announcing their departure with no notice or justification, and all assumed the ambitious
959000	963940	venture was dead for good, yet in 2023 it showed signs of life through a short and ambiguous
963940	965960	press release by Amtrak.
965960	969960	The government-owned rail operator announced it had partnered with Texas Central to continue
969960	973780	early-stage development, and this partnership has actually started to move forward as the
973780	978500	pair was awarded a modest half-million dollar federal grant to continue their work.
978500	983340	While still incredibly ambitious and far from likely to happen, this is at least a subtle
983340	988460	indication that some in Washington identify the merits of a private-sector face to American
988460	993140	passenger rail projects, no matter how public they may be in practice.
993140	997520	And further west, Brightline itself, or at least an affiliated company with common ownership
997520	1002760	and branding, is copy and pasting their business model onto a new geography—Los Angeles to
1002760	1004280	Las Vegas.
1004280	1008520	Like their Florida route, this is a massive sunbelt travel corridor buoyed by tourism
1008520	1012780	with relatively low construction costs, in this case due to the emptiness and flatness
1012780	1017700	of the desert sitting between the two cities, rather than direct ownership of existing tracks.
1017700	1022240	In this more progressive region, the company was able to find deeper public support and,
1022240	1026720	in addition to billions of already approved PAB financing, the company was also awarded
1026720	1031400	billions worth of state and federal grants, perhaps spurred on by the upcoming 2028 Olympics
1031400	1035500	in Los Angeles and the company's bafflingly realistic promise to complete the project
1035500	1036500	by then.
1036500	1040560	So, Brightline West has become the second private passenger rail project in America
1040560	1046760	in the 21st century to tilt into likelier-than-not to happen—so much so that the Biden administration
1046820	1049420	is already taking credit for their role in it.
1049420	1053060	Yet, the reason why Brightline's audacious claims of building a passenger rail service
1053060	1057080	in four years, or even building its Florida service in the first place, were believable
1057080	1061220	is because they're focusing on the absolute lowest-hanging fruit.
1061220	1065500	They're developing service where there is just that perfect three- or four-hour travel
1065500	1070180	time between two wealthy, touristy places, leading to high demand, mixed with perfect
1070180	1074840	geography due to pre-existing rail alignments or its sparse landscape, leading to low construction
1074840	1075840	costs.
1075920	1080040	They're putting passenger trains where they have the absolute best chances of profitability,
1080040	1084720	which is what any well-run private company would and should do.
1084720	1089340	Perhaps the only problem with this is that that's what Amtrak should be doing.
1089340	1093680	Effective passenger rail is not a business, but a public service.
1093680	1098520	Roads are also a public service, meaning they're not built solely where they can turn a profit.
1098520	1102720	If every road in America was converted to a fee-funded model, where users paid based
1102720	1107240	on how much they used them, plenty of busy roads would be plenty profitable, yet plenty
1107240	1110200	more roads would fail to pay for themselves.
1110200	1114980	America doesn't operate roads on a fee-funded model—rather, taxpayer revenue is collected
1114980	1120140	together to fund construction and maintenance overall, yet the same discrepancies exist.
1120140	1125120	Some roads absolutely justify their costs directly, yet many more don't.
1125120	1129540	The rural road connecting far-flung ranches to the city likely could never fund itself
1129540	1134340	using a fee model, yet in the public service model the public accepts this loss because
1134340	1138340	it's considered that this connectivity is worth it for the ranches to be able to deliver
1138340	1143180	product to processors, for example, and getting product to processors easily is worth it for
1143180	1146020	everyone as it lowers the cost of food.
1146020	1150460	Effectively, the taxpayer who only uses the busy urban highway is paying more than their
1150460	1154780	fair share to subsidize that rural road, and the public generally accepts this because
1154780	1157700	connectivity is good for all.
1157700	1162780	Other rail systems should operate under a similar ethos because the exact same principles
1162780	1163900	arise.
1163900	1168460	Any effective system should, and globally does, use the profits from high traffic and
1168460	1173020	less expensive corridors to offset the losses from low traffic and more expensive ones since
1173020	1177140	that nationwide connectivity does a lot more than just capture demand.
1177140	1181480	It improves social and economic mobility, it grows the national economy, it does plenty
1181480	1185480	that is worth it for the passengers that only ever take the high traffic line, justifying
1185480	1189320	the profits from their trips to transfer to pay for the losses from another's.
1189320	1194220	So, in a perfect world, Amtrak or another national rail operator would be reaping the
1194220	1198780	profits from those Miami to Orlando or LA to Vegas trips and using them to run trains
1198780	1203680	from Idaho Falls to Salt Lake City, but with each corridor that the private sector builds
1203680	1206640	up, the potential of that perfect world diminishes.
1206640	1211980	But of course, Amtrak and the government that has held it back have had decades to develop
1211980	1218240	meaningful service on these routes, and have not, so the time is long past to argue that
1218240	1221320	we should delay good to get great.
1221320	1225000	But hopefully this good scenario can till public sentiment in a way that prevents such
1225000	1228720	potent pushback against national, public sector rail development.
1228720	1235860	Brightline, by all early measures, is a success—190,000 passengers rode the company's new Miami to
1235860	1240760	Orlando service in its first 70 days of operation, and the monthly averages continue to climb
1240780	1245060	as they've upped frequency to 16 trains in each direction each day.
1245060	1249420	Also, after just a few years of operation, the company's West Palm Beach to Miami segment
1249420	1253580	attained operational profitability with all indications suggesting that the long-distance
1253580	1256740	segment to Orlando will follow in the coming years.
1256740	1260940	This momentum seemingly pushed the affiliate company's western expansion into reality
1260940	1264500	with far more public support than it received for its initial service.
1264500	1270740	Now, if this is the start of an American passenger rail renaissance, it's truly just the out-of-the-box
1271720	1273520	absolute tiniest of starts.
1273520	1277680	The country has an unbelievably long way to go to catch up with the rest of the wealthy
1277680	1281820	world, and many dominance need to fall in the right direction for these private sector
1281820	1284320	projects to lead to widespread public good.
1284320	1288920	But at the very least, it's a believable start—it's a moment that one could imagine
1288920	1296980	looking back on as the small start that cascaded into a passenger rail renaissance.
1297000	1301480	This new era of private passenger rail development is an indication of how powerfully tweaking
1301480	1305040	the underlying business model of something can lead to different results.
1305040	1309200	Amtrak and Brightline are both running trains, but Brightline's business model has allowed
1309200	1312420	it to do it better, faster, and in more places.
1312420	1314680	We had similar thoughts when we started Nebula.
1314680	1318240	A bunch of us creators came together and started talking about how we could design a business
1318240	1321680	model for a streaming site that would lead to the best content possible.
1321680	1323600	To start with, we got rid of ads.
1323600	1327260	It incentivized creators to chase clicks over creating the best, most meaningful videos,
1327260	1331100	and they also lead to highly variable revenue for the creator, which makes it tougher to
1331100	1334820	plan financially, so instead we went with a subscription model.
1334820	1339020	This allows us to set aside a portion of our monthly revenue for content development itself,
1339020	1343740	which is what funds Nebula Originals—big-budget, dream projects for creators that simply would
1343740	1345880	not work financially on YouTube.
1345880	1349460	Nebula recently released the Patrick Williams Holiday Special, including a guest appearance
1349460	1353460	by me, the first couple episodes of Archaeology Quest by Real Science, and another Modern
1353460	1356920	Conflicts video by RealLifeLore about the Lebanese Civil War.
1356920	1361560	Nebula Originals are consistently great, and we spent much of 2023 working to develop the
1361560	1365960	absolute best slate of releases for 2024 as possible, which are starting to come out at
1365960	1368240	about the highest frequency we've ever had.
1368240	1372360	In fact, we at Wendover are in production right now for our highest budget and most
1372360	1377140	ambitious original to date, and for you jetlag fans, as you likely know, you can also watch
1377140	1380240	every single episode of the show one week early on Nebula.
1380240	1385280	So, in all, Nebula offers you, the viewer, an ad-free experience watching a curated group
1385280	1389260	of a few hundred of the best, most thoughtful creators out there, plus big-budget originals
1389260	1393280	by the same creators, and you get all of this for a surprisingly affordable price.
1393280	1398800	When you sign up at our link, nebulatv.tv-slash-wendover, you'll get 40% off an annual subscription,
1398800	1402960	which brings the cost down to the equivalent of just $2.50 a month.
1402960	1407220	Wendover will even get a portion of that subscription fee for as long as you stay subscribed,
1407220	1409740	so thanks in advance for signing up using our code.
