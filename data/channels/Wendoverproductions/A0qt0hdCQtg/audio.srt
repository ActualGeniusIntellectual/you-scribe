00:00:11,240 --> 00:00:16,240
If you ask the US military how many bases they have overseas, you won't really get

5
00:00:16,240 --> 00:00:17,240
an answer.

6
00:00:17,240 --> 00:00:20,800
They don't make it all too hard to find out about the larger ones—Ramstein Air Base

7
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:24,840
in Germany, Thule Air Base in Greenland, Camp Hansen in Japan.

8
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:28,440
These all show up on the closest thing to an official catalog of the US military's

9
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:29,880
real estate there is.

10
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:32,920
The annual Department of Defense base structure report.

11
00:00:32,920 --> 00:00:37,880
According to this document, the American military has some 514 sites outside of its borders

12
00:00:37,880 --> 00:00:41,880
but, there are some noticeable omissions to this list.

13
00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:46,820
For example, the US has a rather secretive drone base in central Niger however, according

14
00:00:46,820 --> 00:00:49,260
to this list, it doesn't exist.

15
00:00:49,260 --> 00:00:54,880
The US has more than 10 sites in Syria, however, according to this list, they don't exist.

16
00:00:54,880 --> 00:00:58,920
The US has a satellite surveillance facility in Australia's northern territory so well

17
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:04,200
known, in fact, that it has a whole fictional TV show based on it but, according to this

18
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:06,720
list, it doesn't exist.

19
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:10,900
In fact, according to this list, there are just four Defense Department installations

20
00:01:10,900 --> 00:01:16,480
in Africa—a base in Djibouti, a joint British-American base on Ascension Island, an NSA site in Kenya,

21
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:19,640
and a naval medical research facility in Egypt.

22
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:24,080
Of course, if you dig a little deeper into the vast archive of unclassified military

23
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:30,340
documents you find this—a slide from a presentation clearly showing 34 US military

24
00:01:30,340 --> 00:01:31,960
sites in Africa.

25
00:01:31,960 --> 00:01:37,600
With omissions such as these, one can assume that the total 514 number is far from the

26
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:42,620
real count of how many facilities the US military maintains abroad.

27
00:01:42,620 --> 00:01:46,160
Part of this could be attributed to the fact that it's sometimes tough to define what

28
00:01:46,160 --> 00:01:48,480
a military base is.

29
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:52,400
Again looking at the African continent, the only site that looks like what most would

30
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:57,200
traditionally think of as an overseas military base is in Camp Le Monnier in Djibouti.

31
00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:02,100
It is the only permanent, exclusive US military site, at least according to their own definition,

32
00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:07,040
on the continent, hosts about 4,000 members of the US military at a time, and is the primary

33
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:10,040
base of operations for the US-Africa Command.

34
00:02:10,040 --> 00:02:14,520
You see, the US military splits the world into six regions each with their own infrastructure

35
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:17,800
of bases—each has a hierarchy of sites.

36
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:22,040
The highest, in the case of Africa Command, are those permanent, full-blown bases—the

37
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:24,880
one in Djibouti and the one on Ascension Island.

38
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:28,960
One step below that are what are called cooperative security locations.

39
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:33,040
These are, according to the US military's definition, host nation facilities with little

40
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:37,640
or no permanent US personnel presence which may contain pre-positioned equipment and or

41
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:42,400
logistical arrangements and serve both for security cooperation activities and contingency

42
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:43,400
access.

43
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:48,280
CSLs are useful to the US military because they are much less flashy and less permanent.

44
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:52,840
They don't require the same kind of political capital as to set up a full-size base like

45
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:54,380
the one in Djibouti.

46
00:02:54,380 --> 00:02:58,900
Bases are often unpopular and receive press scrutiny, both in the US and the host country,

47
00:02:58,900 --> 00:03:03,840
so small, few hundred person CSLs have the advantage of being able to be set up with,

48
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:05,640
essentially, no publicity.

49
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:09,360
You can think of them as smaller versions of the kind of bases you find in Djibouti

50
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:14,780
or Ascension Island, which can, rather quickly, become bigger bases should the need arise.

51
00:03:14,780 --> 00:03:19,340
The remaining 20 known sites on the continent are what are called contingency locations.

52
00:03:19,340 --> 00:03:25,140
Now, this terminology can be used for a lot of different types of facilities but, in essence,

53
00:03:25,140 --> 00:03:30,140
what it means is that these are temporary sites established as part of ongoing missions.

54
00:03:30,140 --> 00:03:35,060
For example, the contingency location in Garoua, Cameroon was set up for the Americans to provide

55
00:03:35,060 --> 00:03:39,540
logistics and intelligence support in the Cameroonian's fight against Boko Haram.

56
00:03:39,540 --> 00:03:42,880
What that actually means, though, when you break through the military's PR language

57
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:45,480
is that this is a drone base.

58
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:49,520
Unlike other American drone bases, it's relatively easy to find out about the one

59
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:54,120
in Garoua, perhaps because it's primarily home to surveillance drones rather than strike

60
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:55,120
drones.

61
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:59,400
For other contingency locations, though, it is much less clear what exactly their purposes

62
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:03,200
are and for some, they aren't even publicly acknowledged.

63
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:08,080
For many, the US military just has small agreements with foreign governments and the general public

64
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:10,240
gets very little info at all.

65
00:04:10,620 --> 00:04:16,160
So the final, real answer for how many US bases there are abroad is that we don't

66
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:17,160
know.

67
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:21,120
If you define every military installation as a base, compiling all publicly available

68
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:25,160
information, one set of research reached a number of 800.

69
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:29,180
Of course, the real number could be something far different from that but as the general

70
00:04:29,180 --> 00:04:32,480
public, there's just no real way to know.

71
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:37,000
But the next question that arises about the US's overseas presence is why.

72
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:41,600
In the era of nuclear weapons that can obliterate any city on earth in an hour, aircraft carriers

73
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:45,480
sailing worldwide with more aircraft than some countries' air forces, and airplanes

74
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:50,040
that could land troops in any country on earth in a day, why does the US bother spending

75
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:54,840
so much money maintaining bases in allied countries during peacetime?

76
00:04:54,840 --> 00:05:00,640
The primary reason has to do with a military concept known as the loss of strength gradient.

77
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:05,400
This concept essentially theorizes that, the further a conflict is away from a military's

78
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:10,040
home country, the less military power that nation is able to bring to the fight.

79
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:14,460
This is largely because it is, of course, complicated and expensive to bring troops

80
00:05:14,460 --> 00:05:17,340
and equipment over long distances.

81
00:05:17,340 --> 00:05:20,800
The book that originally defined this loss of strength gradient proposed that the way

82
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:25,340
to counteract this effect was to establish bases outside of a country's home territory

83
00:05:25,340 --> 00:05:29,920
since these can help reduce the effective distances to conflict and, therefore, it's

84
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:32,400
easier to bring more power to the fight.

85
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:36,300
The US has certainly taken this concept to heart and has put quite a lot of work into

86
00:05:36,300 --> 00:05:39,660
trying to flatten out their loss of strength gradient.

87
00:05:39,660 --> 00:05:43,400
That is to say, they want to make sure it is just as likely that the US would win a

88
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:46,380
war in East Asia as North America.

89
00:05:46,380 --> 00:05:51,360
As an example of how these bases aid that mission, much of the operations of the US's

90
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:57,280
wars in Afghanistan and Iraq were conducted here—at Ramstein Air Base in Germany.

91
00:05:57,280 --> 00:06:01,880
This base and the other surrounding US military facilities in the Rhineland-Palatinate state

92
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:05,680
make up the largest grouping of American service members in the world and one of the

93
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:08,900
largest groupings of Americans anywhere outside the US.

94
00:06:08,900 --> 00:06:14,040
The city that Ramstein and many of the other facilities are in is home to only about 100,000

95
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:19,740
full-time residents, however, the American bases are staffed by more than 50,000 personnel

96
00:06:19,740 --> 00:06:21,820
at any given time.

97
00:06:21,820 --> 00:06:25,780
This makes Ramstein Air Base like a small American city in Europe.

98
00:06:25,780 --> 00:06:29,500
It has outposts of plenty of American restaurant chains that you won't find anywhere else

99
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:33,780
in Germany—Johnny Rockets, Chili's, PF Chang's—in addition to an American-style

100
00:06:33,780 --> 00:06:35,620
department and grocery store.

101
00:06:35,620 --> 00:06:39,900
It has an American post office, an American high school, baseball diamonds, two American

102
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:45,780
football fields, American suburban-style housing, and even campuses of four American universities—University

103
00:06:45,780 --> 00:06:50,820
of Maryland, Oklahoma, Central Texas College, and Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University.

104
00:06:50,820 --> 00:06:55,140
Quite a lot of work is put into making sure that Ramstein is as similar to any base in

105
00:06:55,140 --> 00:06:59,860
the US as possible—both in terms of lifestyle and capability.

106
00:06:59,860 --> 00:07:04,040
One central role for Ramstein and other US bases in Europe during the wars in Iraq and

107
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:09,260
Afghanistan was as a stopover point for personnel and cargo en route to combat.

108
00:07:09,260 --> 00:07:12,900
Ramstein's convenient location—less than a seven-hour flight from all of the Middle

109
00:07:12,900 --> 00:07:17,380
East, where many of the US's recent military operations have been—makes it a pivotal

110
00:07:17,380 --> 00:07:22,500
logistics hub since it would be far more complicated to fly personnel and cargo non-stop to theater

111
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:26,840
over the more than 11-hour flight from the continental US to the Middle East.

112
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:31,380
Still today, with less US presence in the Middle East, Ramstein plays a central role

113
00:07:31,380 --> 00:07:34,080
in getting US military members to Europe.

114
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:38,260
There are regular flights, typically about twice a week, from Baltimore to Ramstein,

115
00:07:38,260 --> 00:07:42,460
in addition to a number of regular flights from stateside military bases like Wright-Patterson

116
00:07:42,460 --> 00:07:47,220
Air Force Base in Ohio, Dover Air Force Base in Delaware, and McGuire Air Force Base in

117
00:07:47,220 --> 00:07:48,320
New Jersey.

118
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:52,140
These are not flights on commercial airlines, but rather charter flights available only

119
00:07:52,140 --> 00:07:58,140
to members of the military operated by charter companies like Atlas Air and Omni Air International.

120
00:07:58,140 --> 00:08:02,660
Beyond its role as a logistics hub, Ramstein's geographic position plays a critical role

121
00:08:02,660 --> 00:08:05,420
in the US's use of drones in the Middle East.

122
00:08:05,420 --> 00:08:09,660
You see, American drones are communicated with by satellite but, due to the distance

123
00:08:09,660 --> 00:08:13,740
between the Middle East and Creech Air Force Base in Nevada, where the communications from

124
00:08:13,740 --> 00:08:17,740
the different drone piloting sites across the US are centralized, a single satellite

125
00:08:17,740 --> 00:08:20,820
could not convey information from Creech to the Middle East.

126
00:08:20,820 --> 00:08:24,420
That's just because there's too much curvature in the earth for a satellite at

127
00:08:24,420 --> 00:08:28,280
a reasonable orbit altitude to have line of sight with both areas.

128
00:08:28,280 --> 00:08:32,400
They could have one satellite relay info to another, but this would significantly increase

129
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:37,240
the time it would take for the signal to travel from Creech to the drone and, when piloting

130
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:42,180
and attacking remotely, one needs as close to real-time communications as possible.

131
00:08:42,180 --> 00:08:47,340
Therefore, the signals travel by fiber optic, transatlantic cable from the US to Ramstein,

132
00:08:47,340 --> 00:08:51,480
where a relay station then sends the signal up to a satellite based over the area that

133
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:54,460
can communicate with America's drones in the Middle East.

134
00:08:54,460 --> 00:08:58,300
Without Ramstein, these drones would not be nearly as capable.

135
00:08:58,300 --> 00:09:02,480
Beyond convenience and capability, another major reason for America's heavy overseas

136
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:05,460
military presence is power projection.

137
00:09:05,460 --> 00:09:10,380
This is a term used by militaries that refers to, according to the US Department of Defense's

138
00:09:10,380 --> 00:09:15,380
definition, the ability of a nation to apply all or some of its elements of national power.

139
00:09:15,380 --> 00:09:19,960
In this context, it's essentially how fast a country can get to the fight if a fight

140
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:21,280
should arise.

141
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:26,100
Power projection is as much an offensive power as a defensive one—it's about making sure

142
00:09:26,100 --> 00:09:30,920
that every other country in the world knows that America can and potentially will respond

143
00:09:30,920 --> 00:09:34,500
to whatever they decide is a threat in a timely manner.

144
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:37,980
According to the US Department of Defense, the four countries that currently present

145
00:09:37,980 --> 00:09:43,060
the greatest potential national threat to the US are Iran, Russia, China, and North

146
00:09:43,060 --> 00:09:44,060
Korea.

147
00:09:44,060 --> 00:09:48,540
Looking at the global map of bases, it's no coincidence that the greatest concentrations

148
00:09:48,540 --> 00:09:53,620
of overseas bases are near Russia's population center in the east, in the Middle East, and

149
00:09:53,620 --> 00:09:54,620
in East Asia.

150
00:09:54,620 --> 00:10:00,220
Meanwhile, there's relatively little US military presence in South America, Africa,

151
00:10:00,220 --> 00:10:04,580
South and Southeastern Asia, and Australia since there are fewer threats to the US in

152
00:10:04,580 --> 00:10:05,580
these areas.

153
00:10:05,580 --> 00:10:11,380
Still, though, the US military has a nearly permanent presence on every continent.

154
00:10:11,380 --> 00:10:16,260
Even on Antarctica, whereby international treaty militarization is banned, the US military

155
00:10:16,260 --> 00:10:20,780
skirts this regulation by dealing with the logistics of supplying American research bases,

156
00:10:20,780 --> 00:10:22,620
which is allowed by the treaty.

157
00:10:22,620 --> 00:10:26,740
Some might characterize this experience with Antarctic operations as convenient in the

158
00:10:26,740 --> 00:10:29,460
event of any future conflict in this region.

159
00:10:29,460 --> 00:10:34,300
While the US's network of overseas bases is only a part of its overall power projection

160
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:38,980
mission, which also includes its nuclear weapons, aircraft carriers, submarines, and more, the

161
00:10:38,980 --> 00:10:44,060
main messaging they convey is that the US can get to anywhere fast.

162
00:10:44,060 --> 00:10:50,180
But predictably, these bases are controversial—both at home in the US and abroad.

163
00:10:50,180 --> 00:10:56,100
As one example, this is the island of Okinawa, Japan, and this is the land used by the US

164
00:10:56,100 --> 00:10:57,100
military.

165
00:10:57,100 --> 00:11:02,580
On this dense island of 1.5 million, 26,000 US service members man these sites.

166
00:11:02,580 --> 00:11:06,900
While the Japanese government is supportive of the US presence in Okinawa and elsewhere

167
00:11:06,900 --> 00:11:11,420
in Japan, locally, there have been decades of tensions between the Okinawans and the

168
00:11:11,420 --> 00:11:12,620
US military.

169
00:11:12,620 --> 00:11:17,300
The US bases there have been an economic, social, and environmental burden on the island

170
00:11:17,300 --> 00:11:21,680
as, while the US military's presence in Japan as a whole is viewed largely as a benefit

171
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:26,260
for the country, Okinawans are the ones that have to put up with having a large proportion

172
00:11:26,260 --> 00:11:29,220
of their home under the control of a foreign military.

173
00:11:29,220 --> 00:11:33,460
Okinawans reportedly feel like they've been ignored by mainland Japan and they've therefore

174
00:11:33,460 --> 00:11:38,660
been protesting, particularly against a forthcoming base move to a new site on the island, for

175
00:11:38,660 --> 00:11:39,660
years.

176
00:11:39,660 --> 00:11:43,980
This is the story for pretty much every country that hosts US military bases—they're often

177
00:11:43,980 --> 00:11:48,020
considered by foreign governments as a benefit to the country as a whole since it gives them

178
00:11:48,020 --> 00:11:52,300
an essence of protection by perhaps the most powerful military in the world, but it comes

179
00:11:52,300 --> 00:11:56,020
at a burden to the communities that bases are physically located in.

180
00:11:56,020 --> 00:12:00,780
In Okinawa, while the bases do provide a decent amount of employment for locals, it's now

181
00:12:00,780 --> 00:12:04,460
thought that the island could be better off economically with the land that these bases

182
00:12:04,460 --> 00:12:07,260
take up being used for commercial purposes.

183
00:12:07,260 --> 00:12:12,120
Back in the US, some believe that their tax dollars are being used to defend other countries.

184
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:16,780
Some consider these overseas bases antiquated in the era of international military alliances

185
00:12:16,780 --> 00:12:21,700
like NATO, extensive aviation infrastructure that can get US forces anywhere on earth in

186
00:12:21,700 --> 00:12:25,540
a matter of hours, and the deterrent threat of nuclear weapons.

187
00:12:25,540 --> 00:12:31,060
Meanwhile, others would argue that they are crucial assets to US diplomacy and power projection.

188
00:12:31,060 --> 00:12:35,640
They would argue that their very existence maintains the US's superpower status.

189
00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:41,340
This is all to say, simply, that the US military's worldwide presence is controversial, but likely

190
00:12:41,340 --> 00:12:42,340
effective.

191
00:12:42,340 --> 00:12:47,780
They certainly do make the US military seem more formidable in the international eye which

192
00:12:47,780 --> 00:12:54,220
many Americans would consider a positive, but the final grand question is at what cost?

193
00:12:54,220 --> 00:12:59,000
With the cost in dollars, the cost in geopolitical tensions, the cost in community detriment,

194
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:05,940
the simple cost in how the world views the United States as a country, is it worth it?

195
00:13:05,940 --> 00:13:09,940
If you're a viewer of Wendover Productions, you probably are someone who likes learning

196
00:13:09,940 --> 00:13:11,600
about interesting things.

197
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:14,980
One topic that I personally think is quite interesting that I haven't touched much

198
00:13:14,980 --> 00:13:17,620
before on this channel is probability.

199
00:13:17,620 --> 00:13:21,400
The field of probability is one that seems simple at first but becomes more and more

200
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:25,680
complex with the more and more you learn and can have some quite useful real-world

201
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:26,800
applications.

202
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:31,440
If you want to learn how to apply the principles of probability, Brilliant has five fantastic

203
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:36,240
courses taking you all the way through the basic to advanced concepts in probability.

204
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:40,700
Like all their courses, these do an amazing job of breaking down complex subjects into

205
00:13:40,700 --> 00:13:44,240
intuitive simple chunks and then bringing those all together.

206
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:49,480
Of course, these are just a few of Brilliant's courses and, if probability isn't for you,

207
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:52,700
there are tons of others in a wide variety of subjects.

208
00:13:52,700 --> 00:13:57,500
