11240	16240	If you ask the US military how many bases they have overseas, you won't really get
16240	17240	an answer.
17240	20800	They don't make it all too hard to find out about the larger ones—Ramstein Air Base
20800	24840	in Germany, Thule Air Base in Greenland, Camp Hansen in Japan.
24840	28440	These all show up on the closest thing to an official catalog of the US military's
28440	29880	real estate there is.
29880	32920	The annual Department of Defense base structure report.
32920	37880	According to this document, the American military has some 514 sites outside of its borders
37880	41880	but, there are some noticeable omissions to this list.
41880	46820	For example, the US has a rather secretive drone base in central Niger however, according
46820	49260	to this list, it doesn't exist.
49260	54880	The US has more than 10 sites in Syria, however, according to this list, they don't exist.
54880	58920	The US has a satellite surveillance facility in Australia's northern territory so well
58960	64200	known, in fact, that it has a whole fictional TV show based on it but, according to this
64200	66720	list, it doesn't exist.
66720	70900	In fact, according to this list, there are just four Defense Department installations
70900	76480	in Africa—a base in Djibouti, a joint British-American base on Ascension Island, an NSA site in Kenya,
76480	79640	and a naval medical research facility in Egypt.
79640	84080	Of course, if you dig a little deeper into the vast archive of unclassified military
84080	90340	documents you find this—a slide from a presentation clearly showing 34 US military
90340	91960	sites in Africa.
91960	97600	With omissions such as these, one can assume that the total 514 number is far from the
97600	102620	real count of how many facilities the US military maintains abroad.
102620	106160	Part of this could be attributed to the fact that it's sometimes tough to define what
106160	108480	a military base is.
108480	112400	Again looking at the African continent, the only site that looks like what most would
112400	117200	traditionally think of as an overseas military base is in Camp Le Monnier in Djibouti.
117200	122100	It is the only permanent, exclusive US military site, at least according to their own definition,
122100	127040	on the continent, hosts about 4,000 members of the US military at a time, and is the primary
127040	130040	base of operations for the US-Africa Command.
130040	134520	You see, the US military splits the world into six regions each with their own infrastructure
134520	137800	of bases—each has a hierarchy of sites.
137800	142040	The highest, in the case of Africa Command, are those permanent, full-blown bases—the
142080	144880	one in Djibouti and the one on Ascension Island.
144880	148960	One step below that are what are called cooperative security locations.
148960	153040	These are, according to the US military's definition, host nation facilities with little
153040	157640	or no permanent US personnel presence which may contain pre-positioned equipment and or
157640	162400	logistical arrangements and serve both for security cooperation activities and contingency
162400	163400	access.
163400	168280	CSLs are useful to the US military because they are much less flashy and less permanent.
168280	172840	They don't require the same kind of political capital as to set up a full-size base like
172840	174380	the one in Djibouti.
174380	178900	Bases are often unpopular and receive press scrutiny, both in the US and the host country,
178900	183840	so small, few hundred person CSLs have the advantage of being able to be set up with,
183840	185640	essentially, no publicity.
185640	189360	You can think of them as smaller versions of the kind of bases you find in Djibouti
189360	194780	or Ascension Island, which can, rather quickly, become bigger bases should the need arise.
194780	199340	The remaining 20 known sites on the continent are what are called contingency locations.
199340	205140	Now, this terminology can be used for a lot of different types of facilities but, in essence,
205140	210140	what it means is that these are temporary sites established as part of ongoing missions.
210140	215060	For example, the contingency location in Garoua, Cameroon was set up for the Americans to provide
215060	219540	logistics and intelligence support in the Cameroonian's fight against Boko Haram.
219540	222880	What that actually means, though, when you break through the military's PR language
222880	225480	is that this is a drone base.
225480	229520	Unlike other American drone bases, it's relatively easy to find out about the one
229520	234120	in Garoua, perhaps because it's primarily home to surveillance drones rather than strike
234120	235120	drones.
235120	239400	For other contingency locations, though, it is much less clear what exactly their purposes
239400	243200	are and for some, they aren't even publicly acknowledged.
243200	248080	For many, the US military just has small agreements with foreign governments and the general public
248080	250240	gets very little info at all.
250620	256160	So the final, real answer for how many US bases there are abroad is that we don't
256160	257160	know.
257160	261120	If you define every military installation as a base, compiling all publicly available
261120	265160	information, one set of research reached a number of 800.
265160	269180	Of course, the real number could be something far different from that but as the general
269180	272480	public, there's just no real way to know.
272480	277000	But the next question that arises about the US's overseas presence is why.
277000	281600	In the era of nuclear weapons that can obliterate any city on earth in an hour, aircraft carriers
281600	285480	sailing worldwide with more aircraft than some countries' air forces, and airplanes
285480	290040	that could land troops in any country on earth in a day, why does the US bother spending
290040	294840	so much money maintaining bases in allied countries during peacetime?
294840	300640	The primary reason has to do with a military concept known as the loss of strength gradient.
300640	305400	This concept essentially theorizes that, the further a conflict is away from a military's
305400	310040	home country, the less military power that nation is able to bring to the fight.
310040	314460	This is largely because it is, of course, complicated and expensive to bring troops
314460	317340	and equipment over long distances.
317340	320800	The book that originally defined this loss of strength gradient proposed that the way
320800	325340	to counteract this effect was to establish bases outside of a country's home territory
325340	329920	since these can help reduce the effective distances to conflict and, therefore, it's
329920	332400	easier to bring more power to the fight.
332400	336300	The US has certainly taken this concept to heart and has put quite a lot of work into
336300	339660	trying to flatten out their loss of strength gradient.
339660	343400	That is to say, they want to make sure it is just as likely that the US would win a
343400	346380	war in East Asia as North America.
346380	351360	As an example of how these bases aid that mission, much of the operations of the US's
351360	357280	wars in Afghanistan and Iraq were conducted here—at Ramstein Air Base in Germany.
357280	361880	This base and the other surrounding US military facilities in the Rhineland-Palatinate state
361880	365680	make up the largest grouping of American service members in the world and one of the
365680	368900	largest groupings of Americans anywhere outside the US.
368900	374040	The city that Ramstein and many of the other facilities are in is home to only about 100,000
374040	379740	full-time residents, however, the American bases are staffed by more than 50,000 personnel
379740	381820	at any given time.
381820	385780	This makes Ramstein Air Base like a small American city in Europe.
385780	389500	It has outposts of plenty of American restaurant chains that you won't find anywhere else
389500	393780	in Germany—Johnny Rockets, Chili's, PF Chang's—in addition to an American-style
393780	395620	department and grocery store.
395620	399900	It has an American post office, an American high school, baseball diamonds, two American
399900	405780	football fields, American suburban-style housing, and even campuses of four American universities—University
405780	410820	of Maryland, Oklahoma, Central Texas College, and Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University.
410820	415140	Quite a lot of work is put into making sure that Ramstein is as similar to any base in
415140	419860	the US as possible—both in terms of lifestyle and capability.
419860	424040	One central role for Ramstein and other US bases in Europe during the wars in Iraq and
424040	429260	Afghanistan was as a stopover point for personnel and cargo en route to combat.
429260	432900	Ramstein's convenient location—less than a seven-hour flight from all of the Middle
432900	437380	East, where many of the US's recent military operations have been—makes it a pivotal
437380	442500	logistics hub since it would be far more complicated to fly personnel and cargo non-stop to theater
442500	446840	over the more than 11-hour flight from the continental US to the Middle East.
446840	451380	Still today, with less US presence in the Middle East, Ramstein plays a central role
451380	454080	in getting US military members to Europe.
454080	458260	There are regular flights, typically about twice a week, from Baltimore to Ramstein,
458260	462460	in addition to a number of regular flights from stateside military bases like Wright-Patterson
462460	467220	Air Force Base in Ohio, Dover Air Force Base in Delaware, and McGuire Air Force Base in
467220	468320	New Jersey.
468320	472140	These are not flights on commercial airlines, but rather charter flights available only
472140	478140	to members of the military operated by charter companies like Atlas Air and Omni Air International.
478140	482660	Beyond its role as a logistics hub, Ramstein's geographic position plays a critical role
482660	485420	in the US's use of drones in the Middle East.
485420	489660	You see, American drones are communicated with by satellite but, due to the distance
489660	493740	between the Middle East and Creech Air Force Base in Nevada, where the communications from
493740	497740	the different drone piloting sites across the US are centralized, a single satellite
497740	500820	could not convey information from Creech to the Middle East.
500820	504420	That's just because there's too much curvature in the earth for a satellite at
504420	508280	a reasonable orbit altitude to have line of sight with both areas.
508280	512400	They could have one satellite relay info to another, but this would significantly increase
512400	517240	the time it would take for the signal to travel from Creech to the drone and, when piloting
517240	522180	and attacking remotely, one needs as close to real-time communications as possible.
522180	527340	Therefore, the signals travel by fiber optic, transatlantic cable from the US to Ramstein,
527340	531480	where a relay station then sends the signal up to a satellite based over the area that
531480	534460	can communicate with America's drones in the Middle East.
534460	538300	Without Ramstein, these drones would not be nearly as capable.
538300	542480	Beyond convenience and capability, another major reason for America's heavy overseas
542480	545460	military presence is power projection.
545460	550380	This is a term used by militaries that refers to, according to the US Department of Defense's
550380	555380	definition, the ability of a nation to apply all or some of its elements of national power.
555380	559960	In this context, it's essentially how fast a country can get to the fight if a fight
559960	561280	should arise.
561280	566100	Power projection is as much an offensive power as a defensive one—it's about making sure
566100	570920	that every other country in the world knows that America can and potentially will respond
570920	574500	to whatever they decide is a threat in a timely manner.
574500	577980	According to the US Department of Defense, the four countries that currently present
577980	583060	the greatest potential national threat to the US are Iran, Russia, China, and North
583060	584060	Korea.
584060	588540	Looking at the global map of bases, it's no coincidence that the greatest concentrations
588540	593620	of overseas bases are near Russia's population center in the east, in the Middle East, and
593620	594620	in East Asia.
594620	600220	Meanwhile, there's relatively little US military presence in South America, Africa,
600220	604580	South and Southeastern Asia, and Australia since there are fewer threats to the US in
604580	605580	these areas.
605580	611380	Still, though, the US military has a nearly permanent presence on every continent.
611380	616260	Even on Antarctica, whereby international treaty militarization is banned, the US military
616260	620780	skirts this regulation by dealing with the logistics of supplying American research bases,
620780	622620	which is allowed by the treaty.
622620	626740	Some might characterize this experience with Antarctic operations as convenient in the
626740	629460	event of any future conflict in this region.
629460	634300	While the US's network of overseas bases is only a part of its overall power projection
634300	638980	mission, which also includes its nuclear weapons, aircraft carriers, submarines, and more, the
638980	644060	main messaging they convey is that the US can get to anywhere fast.
644060	650180	But predictably, these bases are controversial—both at home in the US and abroad.
650180	656100	As one example, this is the island of Okinawa, Japan, and this is the land used by the US
656100	657100	military.
657100	662580	On this dense island of 1.5 million, 26,000 US service members man these sites.
662580	666900	While the Japanese government is supportive of the US presence in Okinawa and elsewhere
666900	671420	in Japan, locally, there have been decades of tensions between the Okinawans and the
671420	672620	US military.
672620	677300	The US bases there have been an economic, social, and environmental burden on the island
677300	681680	as, while the US military's presence in Japan as a whole is viewed largely as a benefit
681680	686260	for the country, Okinawans are the ones that have to put up with having a large proportion
686260	689220	of their home under the control of a foreign military.
689220	693460	Okinawans reportedly feel like they've been ignored by mainland Japan and they've therefore
693460	698660	been protesting, particularly against a forthcoming base move to a new site on the island, for
698660	699660	years.
699660	703980	This is the story for pretty much every country that hosts US military bases—they're often
703980	708020	considered by foreign governments as a benefit to the country as a whole since it gives them
708020	712300	an essence of protection by perhaps the most powerful military in the world, but it comes
712300	716020	at a burden to the communities that bases are physically located in.
716020	720780	In Okinawa, while the bases do provide a decent amount of employment for locals, it's now
720780	724460	thought that the island could be better off economically with the land that these bases
724460	727260	take up being used for commercial purposes.
727260	732120	Back in the US, some believe that their tax dollars are being used to defend other countries.
732120	736780	Some consider these overseas bases antiquated in the era of international military alliances
736780	741700	like NATO, extensive aviation infrastructure that can get US forces anywhere on earth in
741700	745540	a matter of hours, and the deterrent threat of nuclear weapons.
745540	751060	Meanwhile, others would argue that they are crucial assets to US diplomacy and power projection.
751060	755640	They would argue that their very existence maintains the US's superpower status.
755640	761340	This is all to say, simply, that the US military's worldwide presence is controversial, but likely
761340	762340	effective.
762340	767780	They certainly do make the US military seem more formidable in the international eye which
767780	774220	many Americans would consider a positive, but the final grand question is at what cost?
774220	779000	With the cost in dollars, the cost in geopolitical tensions, the cost in community detriment,
779000	785940	the simple cost in how the world views the United States as a country, is it worth it?
785940	789940	If you're a viewer of Wendover Productions, you probably are someone who likes learning
789940	791600	about interesting things.
791600	794980	One topic that I personally think is quite interesting that I haven't touched much
794980	797620	before on this channel is probability.
797620	801400	The field of probability is one that seems simple at first but becomes more and more
801400	805680	complex with the more and more you learn and can have some quite useful real-world
805680	806800	applications.
806800	811440	If you want to learn how to apply the principles of probability, Brilliant has five fantastic
811440	816240	courses taking you all the way through the basic to advanced concepts in probability.
816240	820700	Like all their courses, these do an amazing job of breaking down complex subjects into
820700	824240	intuitive simple chunks and then bringing those all together.
824240	829480	Of course, these are just a few of Brilliant's courses and, if probability isn't for you,
829480	832700	there are tons of others in a wide variety of subjects.
