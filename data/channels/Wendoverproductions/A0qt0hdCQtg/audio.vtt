00:11.240 --> 00:16.240
If you ask the US military how many bases they have overseas, you won't really get

00:16.240 --> 00:17.240
an answer.

00:17.240 --> 00:20.800
They don't make it all too hard to find out about the larger ones—Ramstein Air Base

00:20.800 --> 00:24.840
in Germany, Thule Air Base in Greenland, Camp Hansen in Japan.

00:24.840 --> 00:28.440
These all show up on the closest thing to an official catalog of the US military's

00:28.440 --> 00:29.880
real estate there is.

00:29.880 --> 00:32.920
The annual Department of Defense base structure report.

00:32.920 --> 00:37.880
According to this document, the American military has some 514 sites outside of its borders

00:37.880 --> 00:41.880
but, there are some noticeable omissions to this list.

00:41.880 --> 00:46.820
For example, the US has a rather secretive drone base in central Niger however, according

00:46.820 --> 00:49.260
to this list, it doesn't exist.

00:49.260 --> 00:54.880
The US has more than 10 sites in Syria, however, according to this list, they don't exist.

00:54.880 --> 00:58.920
The US has a satellite surveillance facility in Australia's northern territory so well

00:58.960 --> 01:04.200
known, in fact, that it has a whole fictional TV show based on it but, according to this

01:04.200 --> 01:06.720
list, it doesn't exist.

01:06.720 --> 01:10.900
In fact, according to this list, there are just four Defense Department installations

01:10.900 --> 01:16.480
in Africa—a base in Djibouti, a joint British-American base on Ascension Island, an NSA site in Kenya,

01:16.480 --> 01:19.640
and a naval medical research facility in Egypt.

01:19.640 --> 01:24.080
Of course, if you dig a little deeper into the vast archive of unclassified military

01:24.080 --> 01:30.340
documents you find this—a slide from a presentation clearly showing 34 US military

01:30.340 --> 01:31.960
sites in Africa.

01:31.960 --> 01:37.600
With omissions such as these, one can assume that the total 514 number is far from the

01:37.600 --> 01:42.620
real count of how many facilities the US military maintains abroad.

01:42.620 --> 01:46.160
Part of this could be attributed to the fact that it's sometimes tough to define what

01:46.160 --> 01:48.480
a military base is.

01:48.480 --> 01:52.400
Again looking at the African continent, the only site that looks like what most would

01:52.400 --> 01:57.200
traditionally think of as an overseas military base is in Camp Le Monnier in Djibouti.

01:57.200 --> 02:02.100
It is the only permanent, exclusive US military site, at least according to their own definition,

02:02.100 --> 02:07.040
on the continent, hosts about 4,000 members of the US military at a time, and is the primary

02:07.040 --> 02:10.040
base of operations for the US-Africa Command.

02:10.040 --> 02:14.520
You see, the US military splits the world into six regions each with their own infrastructure

02:14.520 --> 02:17.800
of bases—each has a hierarchy of sites.

02:17.800 --> 02:22.040
The highest, in the case of Africa Command, are those permanent, full-blown bases—the

02:22.080 --> 02:24.880
one in Djibouti and the one on Ascension Island.

02:24.880 --> 02:28.960
One step below that are what are called cooperative security locations.

02:28.960 --> 02:33.040
These are, according to the US military's definition, host nation facilities with little

02:33.040 --> 02:37.640
or no permanent US personnel presence which may contain pre-positioned equipment and or

02:37.640 --> 02:42.400
logistical arrangements and serve both for security cooperation activities and contingency

02:42.400 --> 02:43.400
access.

02:43.400 --> 02:48.280
CSLs are useful to the US military because they are much less flashy and less permanent.

02:48.280 --> 02:52.840
They don't require the same kind of political capital as to set up a full-size base like

02:52.840 --> 02:54.380
the one in Djibouti.

02:54.380 --> 02:58.900
Bases are often unpopular and receive press scrutiny, both in the US and the host country,

02:58.900 --> 03:03.840
so small, few hundred person CSLs have the advantage of being able to be set up with,

03:03.840 --> 03:05.640
essentially, no publicity.

03:05.640 --> 03:09.360
You can think of them as smaller versions of the kind of bases you find in Djibouti

03:09.360 --> 03:14.780
or Ascension Island, which can, rather quickly, become bigger bases should the need arise.

03:14.780 --> 03:19.340
The remaining 20 known sites on the continent are what are called contingency locations.

03:19.340 --> 03:25.140
Now, this terminology can be used for a lot of different types of facilities but, in essence,

03:25.140 --> 03:30.140
what it means is that these are temporary sites established as part of ongoing missions.

03:30.140 --> 03:35.060
For example, the contingency location in Garoua, Cameroon was set up for the Americans to provide

03:35.060 --> 03:39.540
logistics and intelligence support in the Cameroonian's fight against Boko Haram.

03:39.540 --> 03:42.880
What that actually means, though, when you break through the military's PR language

03:42.880 --> 03:45.480
is that this is a drone base.

03:45.480 --> 03:49.520
Unlike other American drone bases, it's relatively easy to find out about the one

03:49.520 --> 03:54.120
in Garoua, perhaps because it's primarily home to surveillance drones rather than strike

03:54.120 --> 03:55.120
drones.

03:55.120 --> 03:59.400
For other contingency locations, though, it is much less clear what exactly their purposes

03:59.400 --> 04:03.200
are and for some, they aren't even publicly acknowledged.

04:03.200 --> 04:08.080
For many, the US military just has small agreements with foreign governments and the general public

04:08.080 --> 04:10.240
gets very little info at all.

04:10.620 --> 04:16.160
So the final, real answer for how many US bases there are abroad is that we don't

04:16.160 --> 04:17.160
know.

04:17.160 --> 04:21.120
If you define every military installation as a base, compiling all publicly available

04:21.120 --> 04:25.160
information, one set of research reached a number of 800.

04:25.160 --> 04:29.180
Of course, the real number could be something far different from that but as the general

04:29.180 --> 04:32.480
public, there's just no real way to know.

04:32.480 --> 04:37.000
But the next question that arises about the US's overseas presence is why.

04:37.000 --> 04:41.600
In the era of nuclear weapons that can obliterate any city on earth in an hour, aircraft carriers

04:41.600 --> 04:45.480
sailing worldwide with more aircraft than some countries' air forces, and airplanes

04:45.480 --> 04:50.040
that could land troops in any country on earth in a day, why does the US bother spending

04:50.040 --> 04:54.840
so much money maintaining bases in allied countries during peacetime?

04:54.840 --> 05:00.640
The primary reason has to do with a military concept known as the loss of strength gradient.

05:00.640 --> 05:05.400
This concept essentially theorizes that, the further a conflict is away from a military's

05:05.400 --> 05:10.040
home country, the less military power that nation is able to bring to the fight.

05:10.040 --> 05:14.460
This is largely because it is, of course, complicated and expensive to bring troops

05:14.460 --> 05:17.340
and equipment over long distances.

05:17.340 --> 05:20.800
The book that originally defined this loss of strength gradient proposed that the way

05:20.800 --> 05:25.340
to counteract this effect was to establish bases outside of a country's home territory

05:25.340 --> 05:29.920
since these can help reduce the effective distances to conflict and, therefore, it's

05:29.920 --> 05:32.400
easier to bring more power to the fight.

05:32.400 --> 05:36.300
The US has certainly taken this concept to heart and has put quite a lot of work into

05:36.300 --> 05:39.660
trying to flatten out their loss of strength gradient.

05:39.660 --> 05:43.400
That is to say, they want to make sure it is just as likely that the US would win a

05:43.400 --> 05:46.380
war in East Asia as North America.

05:46.380 --> 05:51.360
As an example of how these bases aid that mission, much of the operations of the US's

05:51.360 --> 05:57.280
wars in Afghanistan and Iraq were conducted here—at Ramstein Air Base in Germany.

05:57.280 --> 06:01.880
This base and the other surrounding US military facilities in the Rhineland-Palatinate state

06:01.880 --> 06:05.680
make up the largest grouping of American service members in the world and one of the

06:05.680 --> 06:08.900
largest groupings of Americans anywhere outside the US.

06:08.900 --> 06:14.040
The city that Ramstein and many of the other facilities are in is home to only about 100,000

06:14.040 --> 06:19.740
full-time residents, however, the American bases are staffed by more than 50,000 personnel

06:19.740 --> 06:21.820
at any given time.

06:21.820 --> 06:25.780
This makes Ramstein Air Base like a small American city in Europe.

06:25.780 --> 06:29.500
It has outposts of plenty of American restaurant chains that you won't find anywhere else

06:29.500 --> 06:33.780
in Germany—Johnny Rockets, Chili's, PF Chang's—in addition to an American-style

06:33.780 --> 06:35.620
department and grocery store.

06:35.620 --> 06:39.900
It has an American post office, an American high school, baseball diamonds, two American

06:39.900 --> 06:45.780
football fields, American suburban-style housing, and even campuses of four American universities—University

06:45.780 --> 06:50.820
of Maryland, Oklahoma, Central Texas College, and Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University.

06:50.820 --> 06:55.140
Quite a lot of work is put into making sure that Ramstein is as similar to any base in

06:55.140 --> 06:59.860
the US as possible—both in terms of lifestyle and capability.

06:59.860 --> 07:04.040
One central role for Ramstein and other US bases in Europe during the wars in Iraq and

07:04.040 --> 07:09.260
Afghanistan was as a stopover point for personnel and cargo en route to combat.

07:09.260 --> 07:12.900
Ramstein's convenient location—less than a seven-hour flight from all of the Middle

07:12.900 --> 07:17.380
East, where many of the US's recent military operations have been—makes it a pivotal

07:17.380 --> 07:22.500
logistics hub since it would be far more complicated to fly personnel and cargo non-stop to theater

07:22.500 --> 07:26.840
over the more than 11-hour flight from the continental US to the Middle East.

07:26.840 --> 07:31.380
Still today, with less US presence in the Middle East, Ramstein plays a central role

07:31.380 --> 07:34.080
in getting US military members to Europe.

07:34.080 --> 07:38.260
There are regular flights, typically about twice a week, from Baltimore to Ramstein,

07:38.260 --> 07:42.460
in addition to a number of regular flights from stateside military bases like Wright-Patterson

07:42.460 --> 07:47.220
Air Force Base in Ohio, Dover Air Force Base in Delaware, and McGuire Air Force Base in

07:47.220 --> 07:48.320
New Jersey.

07:48.320 --> 07:52.140
These are not flights on commercial airlines, but rather charter flights available only

07:52.140 --> 07:58.140
to members of the military operated by charter companies like Atlas Air and Omni Air International.

07:58.140 --> 08:02.660
Beyond its role as a logistics hub, Ramstein's geographic position plays a critical role

08:02.660 --> 08:05.420
in the US's use of drones in the Middle East.

08:05.420 --> 08:09.660
You see, American drones are communicated with by satellite but, due to the distance

08:09.660 --> 08:13.740
between the Middle East and Creech Air Force Base in Nevada, where the communications from

08:13.740 --> 08:17.740
the different drone piloting sites across the US are centralized, a single satellite

08:17.740 --> 08:20.820
could not convey information from Creech to the Middle East.

08:20.820 --> 08:24.420
That's just because there's too much curvature in the earth for a satellite at

08:24.420 --> 08:28.280
a reasonable orbit altitude to have line of sight with both areas.

08:28.280 --> 08:32.400
They could have one satellite relay info to another, but this would significantly increase

08:32.400 --> 08:37.240
the time it would take for the signal to travel from Creech to the drone and, when piloting

08:37.240 --> 08:42.180
and attacking remotely, one needs as close to real-time communications as possible.

08:42.180 --> 08:47.340
Therefore, the signals travel by fiber optic, transatlantic cable from the US to Ramstein,

08:47.340 --> 08:51.480
where a relay station then sends the signal up to a satellite based over the area that

08:51.480 --> 08:54.460
can communicate with America's drones in the Middle East.

08:54.460 --> 08:58.300
Without Ramstein, these drones would not be nearly as capable.

08:58.300 --> 09:02.480
Beyond convenience and capability, another major reason for America's heavy overseas

09:02.480 --> 09:05.460
military presence is power projection.

09:05.460 --> 09:10.380
This is a term used by militaries that refers to, according to the US Department of Defense's

09:10.380 --> 09:15.380
definition, the ability of a nation to apply all or some of its elements of national power.

09:15.380 --> 09:19.960
In this context, it's essentially how fast a country can get to the fight if a fight

09:19.960 --> 09:21.280
should arise.

09:21.280 --> 09:26.100
Power projection is as much an offensive power as a defensive one—it's about making sure

09:26.100 --> 09:30.920
that every other country in the world knows that America can and potentially will respond

09:30.920 --> 09:34.500
to whatever they decide is a threat in a timely manner.

09:34.500 --> 09:37.980
According to the US Department of Defense, the four countries that currently present

09:37.980 --> 09:43.060
the greatest potential national threat to the US are Iran, Russia, China, and North

09:43.060 --> 09:44.060
Korea.

09:44.060 --> 09:48.540
Looking at the global map of bases, it's no coincidence that the greatest concentrations

09:48.540 --> 09:53.620
of overseas bases are near Russia's population center in the east, in the Middle East, and

09:53.620 --> 09:54.620
in East Asia.

09:54.620 --> 10:00.220
Meanwhile, there's relatively little US military presence in South America, Africa,

10:00.220 --> 10:04.580
South and Southeastern Asia, and Australia since there are fewer threats to the US in

10:04.580 --> 10:05.580
these areas.

10:05.580 --> 10:11.380
Still, though, the US military has a nearly permanent presence on every continent.

10:11.380 --> 10:16.260
Even on Antarctica, whereby international treaty militarization is banned, the US military

10:16.260 --> 10:20.780
skirts this regulation by dealing with the logistics of supplying American research bases,

10:20.780 --> 10:22.620
which is allowed by the treaty.

10:22.620 --> 10:26.740
Some might characterize this experience with Antarctic operations as convenient in the

10:26.740 --> 10:29.460
event of any future conflict in this region.

10:29.460 --> 10:34.300
While the US's network of overseas bases is only a part of its overall power projection

10:34.300 --> 10:38.980
mission, which also includes its nuclear weapons, aircraft carriers, submarines, and more, the

10:38.980 --> 10:44.060
main messaging they convey is that the US can get to anywhere fast.

10:44.060 --> 10:50.180
But predictably, these bases are controversial—both at home in the US and abroad.

10:50.180 --> 10:56.100
As one example, this is the island of Okinawa, Japan, and this is the land used by the US

10:56.100 --> 10:57.100
military.

10:57.100 --> 11:02.580
On this dense island of 1.5 million, 26,000 US service members man these sites.

11:02.580 --> 11:06.900
While the Japanese government is supportive of the US presence in Okinawa and elsewhere

11:06.900 --> 11:11.420
in Japan, locally, there have been decades of tensions between the Okinawans and the

11:11.420 --> 11:12.620
US military.

11:12.620 --> 11:17.300
The US bases there have been an economic, social, and environmental burden on the island

11:17.300 --> 11:21.680
as, while the US military's presence in Japan as a whole is viewed largely as a benefit

11:21.680 --> 11:26.260
for the country, Okinawans are the ones that have to put up with having a large proportion

11:26.260 --> 11:29.220
of their home under the control of a foreign military.

11:29.220 --> 11:33.460
Okinawans reportedly feel like they've been ignored by mainland Japan and they've therefore

11:33.460 --> 11:38.660
been protesting, particularly against a forthcoming base move to a new site on the island, for

11:38.660 --> 11:39.660
years.

11:39.660 --> 11:43.980
This is the story for pretty much every country that hosts US military bases—they're often

11:43.980 --> 11:48.020
considered by foreign governments as a benefit to the country as a whole since it gives them

11:48.020 --> 11:52.300
an essence of protection by perhaps the most powerful military in the world, but it comes

11:52.300 --> 11:56.020
at a burden to the communities that bases are physically located in.

11:56.020 --> 12:00.780
In Okinawa, while the bases do provide a decent amount of employment for locals, it's now

12:00.780 --> 12:04.460
thought that the island could be better off economically with the land that these bases

12:04.460 --> 12:07.260
take up being used for commercial purposes.

12:07.260 --> 12:12.120
Back in the US, some believe that their tax dollars are being used to defend other countries.

12:12.120 --> 12:16.780
Some consider these overseas bases antiquated in the era of international military alliances

12:16.780 --> 12:21.700
like NATO, extensive aviation infrastructure that can get US forces anywhere on earth in

12:21.700 --> 12:25.540
a matter of hours, and the deterrent threat of nuclear weapons.

12:25.540 --> 12:31.060
Meanwhile, others would argue that they are crucial assets to US diplomacy and power projection.

12:31.060 --> 12:35.640
They would argue that their very existence maintains the US's superpower status.

12:35.640 --> 12:41.340
This is all to say, simply, that the US military's worldwide presence is controversial, but likely

12:41.340 --> 12:42.340
effective.

12:42.340 --> 12:47.780
They certainly do make the US military seem more formidable in the international eye which

12:47.780 --> 12:54.220
many Americans would consider a positive, but the final grand question is at what cost?

12:54.220 --> 12:59.000
With the cost in dollars, the cost in geopolitical tensions, the cost in community detriment,

12:59.000 --> 13:05.940
the simple cost in how the world views the United States as a country, is it worth it?

13:05.940 --> 13:09.940
If you're a viewer of Wendover Productions, you probably are someone who likes learning

13:09.940 --> 13:11.600
about interesting things.

13:11.600 --> 13:14.980
One topic that I personally think is quite interesting that I haven't touched much

13:14.980 --> 13:17.620
before on this channel is probability.

13:17.620 --> 13:21.400
The field of probability is one that seems simple at first but becomes more and more

13:21.400 --> 13:25.680
complex with the more and more you learn and can have some quite useful real-world

13:25.680 --> 13:26.800
applications.

13:26.800 --> 13:31.440
If you want to learn how to apply the principles of probability, Brilliant has five fantastic

13:31.440 --> 13:36.240
courses taking you all the way through the basic to advanced concepts in probability.

13:36.240 --> 13:40.700
Like all their courses, these do an amazing job of breaking down complex subjects into

13:40.700 --> 13:44.240
