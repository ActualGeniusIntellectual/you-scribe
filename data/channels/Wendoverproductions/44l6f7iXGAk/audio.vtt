00:00.000 --> 00:05.200
The wealthiest county in America is not in Silicon Valley, it's not in New York, but

00:05.200 --> 00:09.640
rather it's here—Loudon County, Virginia.

00:09.640 --> 00:14.040
This DC suburb boasts the highest medium household income in the US.

00:14.040 --> 00:18.640
What it lacks in billionaires, it makes up for with a massive upper-middle class working

00:18.640 --> 00:23.920
six-figure desk jobs at government contractors—Northrop Grumman, Raytheon Technologies, New Star,

00:23.920 --> 00:28.320
and more—leading to a landscape peppered with one, two, and three million dollar homes,

00:28.320 --> 00:33.120
Ferrari, McLaren, and Rolls Royce dealerships, resorts, horse farms, and polo fields.

00:33.120 --> 00:38.440
But perhaps the most bizarre part of Loudon County is its western border.

00:38.440 --> 00:44.560
On one side is a place where the average household brings in $157,000 a year.

00:44.560 --> 00:50.620
On the other is a state where that same average is less than $51,000.

00:50.620 --> 00:56.140
In comparison to its mid-Atlantic surroundings, West Virginia sticks out remarkably.

00:56.140 --> 01:01.580
Its GDP per capita is just $53,000—second lowest in the country.

01:01.580 --> 01:08.100
Poverty is at 17.1%, fourth highest in the US, and far higher than the region around.

01:08.100 --> 01:13.860
Life expectancy is just 74.7—second lowest in the US, and roughly equivalent to that

01:13.860 --> 01:16.580
of the nation of Slovakia.

01:16.580 --> 01:22.700
But beyond the statistics, at its core, West Virginia is, and long has been, a region in

01:22.700 --> 01:23.700
decline.

01:24.420 --> 01:29.980
Its population peaked the better part of a century ago, in 1950, and has been on a slow,

01:29.980 --> 01:32.180
steady slide down ever since.

01:32.180 --> 01:37.340
Nowadays, it's one of just three shrinking states, and it's by far on the fastest pace,

01:37.340 --> 01:42.660
partially since year after year, unlike in every other American state, more people die

01:42.660 --> 01:43.980
than are born.

01:43.980 --> 01:49.100
Self-reported mental health is at an all-time low—in one study, the 13 American counties

01:49.100 --> 01:53.160
with the worst scores were all in West Virginia.

01:53.160 --> 01:58.200
Just as both a cause and effect of that, drug use is absolutely rampant.

01:58.200 --> 02:03.080
Across one six-year span, pharmaceutical companies sold the equivalent of 400 opioid pills for

02:03.080 --> 02:08.680
every person in West Virginia, and that was only the supposedly legal trade.

02:08.680 --> 02:14.960
The state as a whole is in a bleak situation, but even within that average, there are shades

02:14.960 --> 02:16.240
of bleakness.

02:16.240 --> 02:21.720
Essentially every issue reaches its most acute form here—McDowell County.

02:21.720 --> 02:26.280
This southernmost slice of the state regularly ranks as its poorest and one of the absolute

02:26.280 --> 02:27.900
poorest in the nation.

02:27.900 --> 02:33.480
Per capita income is just $14,000, which means the economic situation of its residents is

02:33.480 --> 02:38.600
roughly analogous to that of those of the nation of Panama.

02:38.600 --> 02:44.680
Life expectancy is just 70.4 years—the same as that of Iraq.

02:44.680 --> 02:50.160
Having declined from a peak population of 100,000 to just 18,000 today, the landscape

02:50.160 --> 02:53.000
is that of neglect.

02:53.000 --> 02:56.120
Towns are mere shells of what was.

02:56.120 --> 03:00.820
And few have fallen further than its county seat, Welch.

03:00.820 --> 03:05.460
The Elkhorn Creek and Tug Fork cut right through its downtown, while the mountains rise straight

03:05.460 --> 03:06.900
up above it.

03:06.900 --> 03:11.960
Straddling such rough country, Welch has been forced to compromise, adopting not a traditional

03:11.960 --> 03:16.220
grid, but a street pattern that follows the contours of the rivers below and the mountains

03:16.220 --> 03:17.440
above.

03:17.440 --> 03:22.740
And just as McDowell Street, Virginia Avenue, and US Route 52 follow the path cut by cascading

03:22.740 --> 03:27.360
West Virginian waterways, so too does the railway—this single piece of infrastructure

03:27.360 --> 03:32.880
that explains why this town, split by rivers, hemmed in by mountains in all directions,

03:32.880 --> 03:35.720
even exists in the first place.

03:35.720 --> 03:40.440
Before Welch, or McDowell County, or southern West Virginia was known for what it lacks,

03:40.440 --> 03:44.280
where it falls behind, or why it's so different from the rest of the country, these rails

03:44.280 --> 03:48.160
made this region the middle of American might.

03:48.160 --> 03:52.200
Since before the Civil War, West Virginia's wealth in coal was well understood—it was

03:52.200 --> 03:55.480
simply an issue of getting to the resource, then getting it out.

03:55.480 --> 03:59.680
First, it was the east-west running Baltimore and Ohio line that connected northern coal

03:59.680 --> 04:04.400
fields to midwest and eastern markets, then the Chesapeake and Ohio, and finally, near

04:04.400 --> 04:09.580
centuries close, it was the Norfolk and western that collectively opened the state for business.

04:09.580 --> 04:14.240
Now with the means to move it, the coal-rich West Virginia boomed from north to south.

04:14.240 --> 04:21.240
From a state of 440,000 people in 1870, West Virginia nearly crested a million by 1900.

04:21.240 --> 04:24.860
In the same span that the population more than doubled, coal production from the state

04:24.860 --> 04:32.180
went from 600,000 tons to more than 22 million a year—almost a 40-fold increase.

04:32.180 --> 04:36.920
Along railways, mines, and the other accompanying camps, tiny hamlets and company towns popped

04:36.920 --> 04:39.580
up practically every other mile.

04:39.580 --> 04:42.920
And the boom had only just begun.

04:42.920 --> 04:46.780
According to the party, McDowell County now led the charge.

04:46.780 --> 04:50.720
Connected to the rest of the nation by rail and home to the famed Pocahontas coal field,

04:50.720 --> 04:55.280
the state's southernmost county became one of industrial America's most important.

04:55.280 --> 05:00.280
US Coke and Coal, a subsidiary of the Titanic US Steel, set up the company town of Gary

05:00.280 --> 05:04.380
to produce coke on site, and shipped to steel mills in the midwest, then it set up Gary

05:04.380 --> 05:10.420
2, Gary 3, Gary 4, all the way through Gary 11, neighboring and competing with an array

05:10.420 --> 05:13.060
of other privately-funded pop-up towns.

05:13.060 --> 05:17.440
The interest in McDowell's bountiful endowments went beyond the private sector, too.

05:17.440 --> 05:22.240
The US Navy also turned its attention to the region, as some Pocahontas coal burned so

05:22.240 --> 05:25.080
clean that it became their first choice.

05:25.080 --> 05:29.340
They called it smokeless coal, a relative term by today's standards, but the Navy

05:29.340 --> 05:33.520
absolutely fired US warships with it all the way through the mid-century.

05:33.520 --> 05:38.200
In just a matter of decades, McDowell, its county seat of Welch, and its quality Pocahontas

05:38.200 --> 05:42.700
coal seams were the muscle behind American industry, and by filling the halls of Theodore

05:42.700 --> 05:47.860
Roosevelt's Great White Fleet, had become the literal fuel of America's growing international

05:47.860 --> 05:48.860
prestige.

05:48.860 --> 05:53.080
As the 1900s progressed, some things changed.

05:53.080 --> 05:57.220
With the onset of the labor movement, working conditions became less horrific, wages rose

05:57.220 --> 06:01.500
and came to be paid with real currency rather than company currencies, while American naval

06:01.500 --> 06:04.680
ships, then all ships, moved from coal to oil.

06:04.680 --> 06:09.540
What remained consistent, though, was West Virginia's sole economic loyalty to coal

06:09.540 --> 06:10.540
mining.

06:10.540 --> 06:16.500
From 1910 to 1950, McDowell's population went from about 20,000 to nearly 100,000,

06:16.500 --> 06:21.000
while statewide coal production now definitively outpaced all other contenders, under things

06:21.000 --> 06:27.700
some 144 million tons of coal on the year—nearly 40 million more than the next highest producer,

06:27.700 --> 06:28.700
Pennsylvania.

06:28.700 --> 06:33.620
And leading the highest producing state was McDowell, now the nation's highest producing

06:33.620 --> 06:35.220
county.

06:35.220 --> 06:37.720
But then, more change.

06:37.720 --> 06:42.060
Demand for coal in post-war America from traditional users diminished.

06:42.060 --> 06:47.000
As American industry slowed, steel slowed, so demand for coke slowed.

06:47.000 --> 06:52.200
Undeterred, West Virginia mines, rather than slowing production, pivoted to overseas export

06:52.200 --> 06:53.780
and power generation.

06:53.780 --> 06:57.620
As American environmental regulations and awareness pressured domestic coal-fired power

06:57.620 --> 07:02.000
plants out of business, more coal went to energy-hungry markets like India.

07:02.000 --> 07:06.720
As the world shifted, West Virginia found ways to keep shipping a product.

07:06.720 --> 07:11.220
Not until 1997 did West Virginia finally reach peak production.

07:11.220 --> 07:16.320
By this point, however, the connection between population, job creation, and production had

07:16.320 --> 07:18.960
been long severed.

07:18.960 --> 07:23.700
Since the 1950s, McDowell's population has been on the decline, in short, because

07:23.700 --> 07:24.700
of machines.

07:24.700 --> 07:31.040
Of the 25.5 million tons of coal produced in McDowell County in 1940, more than 23 million

07:31.080 --> 07:33.960
tons were mined and loaded by hand.

07:33.960 --> 07:39.480
Just ten years later, in 1950, of the county's nearly 21 million tons of produced coal, just

07:39.480 --> 07:44.120
under 9 million were procured by hand, as cutting machines and conveyors had quickly

07:44.120 --> 07:45.400
taken hold.

07:45.400 --> 07:49.960
The result of such mechanization entirely decoupled McDowell's production from its

07:49.960 --> 07:55.100
population as the county entered steady decline through the end of the century.

07:55.100 --> 07:59.960
As margins tightened every time the industry had to pivot, it became more and more critical

07:59.960 --> 08:01.400
to cut costs.

08:01.400 --> 08:06.400
For those who stayed employed, the operational and managerial roles were solid middle-class

08:06.400 --> 08:11.240
jobs, but jobs that were becoming rarer and rarer, and jobs that, as they dried up, simply

08:11.240 --> 08:16.160
weren't being replaced within the borders of McDowell County, or for that matter, anywhere

08:16.160 --> 08:18.200
within West Virginia.

08:18.200 --> 08:23.600
Coal therefore cleanly explains West Virginia's fall, but it doesn't explain why it hasn't

08:23.600 --> 08:25.760
been able to pick itself back up.

08:25.760 --> 08:30.080
There are plenty of rural areas in the US, the majority of the country is rural, and

08:30.080 --> 08:33.920
while there is a significant degree of economic disparity in comparison to the country's

08:33.920 --> 08:39.120
urban areas, the rest of rural America is not nearly in such a dire state.

08:39.120 --> 08:42.320
So why is West Virginia different?

08:42.320 --> 08:47.120
The West Virginia Department of Economic Development strived to answer this question in their 2022

08:47.120 --> 08:48.120
development plan.

08:48.120 --> 08:52.320
They offered a handful of explanations for the state's poverty, but almost every cited

08:52.320 --> 08:58.680
factor was simultaneously a cause and effect—crumbling infrastructure, lack of broadband access,

08:58.680 --> 09:02.920
low education levels, poor health, abandoned urban areas.

09:02.920 --> 09:08.440
Poverty is a vicious cycle—the state of poverty perpetuates poverty, but all cycles

09:08.440 --> 09:10.520
have to have had a start.

09:10.520 --> 09:17.360
The one cited factor that is not both a cause and effect, just merely a cause, was geography.

09:17.400 --> 09:21.400
West Virginia is the least flat state in America.

09:21.400 --> 09:27.640
Just 12% of its land is considered even relatively flat, and this one simple fact creates a web

09:27.640 --> 09:29.120
of consequences.

09:29.120 --> 09:33.680
The largest employment sector in rural America writ large, based on the census' sectoral

09:33.680 --> 09:38.760
definitions, is the combination of educational services, healthcare, and social assistance.

09:38.760 --> 09:43.480
This includes teachers, nurses, caregivers, and other people servicing jobs that exist

09:43.480 --> 09:45.380
essentially everywhere.

09:45.380 --> 09:51.760
The second largest rural economic sector is manufacturing, representing 12% of jobs outside

09:51.760 --> 09:52.760
of urban areas.

09:52.760 --> 09:58.980
As a proportion of overall US employment, it's still 9%, yet in West Virginia, an

09:58.980 --> 10:03.340
almost entirely rural state, it's just 7%.

10:03.340 --> 10:08.100
Now, the seven factories that the West Virginia Department of Economic Development touts as

10:08.100 --> 10:13.780
top manufacturing-related businesses paint a picture as to why the sector struggles.

10:13.780 --> 10:18.580
Everlight is in downtown Huntington, a city that developed across the naturally flat banks

10:18.580 --> 10:19.900
of the Ohio River.

10:19.900 --> 10:24.540
Kingsford Charcoal is in a more rural area, but along the also naturally flat banks of

10:24.540 --> 10:26.540
the North Branch of the Potomac River.

10:26.540 --> 10:33.380
Milan, Covestro, and Fiesta Tableware, too, are located in near-identical riverside spots.

10:33.380 --> 10:38.380
The only of these seven not in a similar situation are American Woodmark and Procter & Gamble,

10:38.380 --> 10:42.720
but they're both in the atypically flat eastern portion of the state.

10:42.720 --> 10:47.720
More universally, manufacturers are not building factories on hillsides, and most of the elusive

10:47.720 --> 10:50.960
flat spots are already developed.

10:50.960 --> 10:55.420
The appeal of locating manufacturing in rural areas is the ability to achieve lower costs

10:55.420 --> 11:00.880
through cheap labor and cheap land, but West Virginia lacks the second part of that equation.

11:00.880 --> 11:04.600
Rather than spending to develop a site where it's tough or paying the premium for already

11:04.600 --> 11:09.960
prepared spots, manufacturers can just go quite literally anywhere else.

11:10.200 --> 11:15.520
Now, the weakness of the second largest rural economic sector is a problem in and of itself,

11:15.520 --> 11:17.520
but its effects are disproportionate.

11:17.520 --> 11:22.880
That's because average wages from the first and third largest rural economic sectors are

11:22.880 --> 11:26.460
dramatically lower than those of manufacturing.

11:26.460 --> 11:32.240
This sector, at least on average, is a key source of higher-pay, middle-class jobs in

11:32.240 --> 11:33.640
rural America.

11:33.640 --> 11:38.960
West Virginia, meanwhile, has to deal more with the lower-income sectors.

11:38.960 --> 11:43.880
Of course, another major rural economic sector is agriculture, and agriculture has long been

11:43.880 --> 11:48.200
a key part of West Virginia's economy, but the landscape that's been there for millennia

11:48.200 --> 11:51.320
is presenting new challenges for the sector.

11:51.320 --> 11:54.760
The state's geography is convoluted, but remarkably predictable.

11:54.760 --> 11:59.160
Whereas, out west one tends to see massive mountains with proportionally larger valleys

11:59.160 --> 12:04.180
in between, enough space for larger towns and productive agriculture, in West Virginia

12:04.180 --> 12:07.280
the scale is shrunk down on both fronts.

12:07.280 --> 12:12.440
That means that, consistently, towns pop up on flat sections of riverbank, then most valleys

12:12.440 --> 12:17.440
are centered by a single road flanked by houses—areas known as hollows.

12:17.440 --> 12:21.680
Sitting in between are the hills, which, by and large, are either destroyed by now-dead

12:21.680 --> 12:25.380
coal mines or our untouched wilderness.

12:25.380 --> 12:27.040
This has consequences.

12:27.040 --> 12:32.440
First, there's little crop farming in West Virginia, the type that relies most on large

12:32.440 --> 12:34.300
swaths of flat land.

12:34.300 --> 12:38.620
The little that exists is primarily in the flatter eastern and northern sections.

12:38.620 --> 12:43.540
The state focuses more on cattle and poultry, as this agricultural sector requires far less

12:43.540 --> 12:47.020
land and produces far more value per unit of land.

12:47.020 --> 12:50.620
But the farms that do exist are also small.

12:50.620 --> 12:55.700
Whereas, across the US, approximately 11% of agricultural sales come from farms selling

12:55.700 --> 13:01.180
less than $250,000 a year, 29% of West Virginia's do.

13:01.180 --> 13:04.300
With hills sitting in the way, farms can only get so big.

13:04.300 --> 13:08.900
In the past this was hardly a barrier, as most farms nationwide reached no larger than

13:08.900 --> 13:12.540
what one family could manage, but that's no longer the case.

13:12.540 --> 13:17.360
Much of the nation's cattle, for example, now comes from large, factory-style farms

13:17.360 --> 13:21.620
like this, the Kismet, Kansas branch of cobalt cattle.

13:21.620 --> 13:26.020
If one were to try to place this feedlot in West Virginia, it simply wouldn't fit.

13:26.020 --> 13:30.660
But the reason why agribusiness is now the norm is because of the economies of scale

13:30.660 --> 13:31.980
it unlocks.

13:31.980 --> 13:36.380
Cobalt cattle is simply able to produce at a lower cost, which puts downward price pressure

13:36.380 --> 13:38.360
on the industry as a whole.

13:38.360 --> 13:41.980
That means these small family farms in West Virginia are having to sell their cattle for

13:41.980 --> 13:47.060
less while still maintaining high operating prices, shrinking already narrow profit margins,

13:47.060 --> 13:50.780
and putting this key economic sector on the path of decline.

13:50.780 --> 13:56.220
It's therefore no wonder why the state's cattle inventory is at almost half of its

13:56.220 --> 13:58.060
all-time high.

13:58.060 --> 14:03.360
Of course, there are other places with land that is incompatible with agriculture or industry.

14:03.360 --> 14:08.660
The vast majority of Nevada, for example, is simply too dry to make farming worthwhile.

14:08.660 --> 14:14.240
Alaska, as another example, is simply too far for manufacturing to make sense.

14:14.240 --> 14:19.300
Even neighboring Kentucky has near-identical geography inhibiting development in a near-identical

14:19.300 --> 14:26.380
way, but crucially, it also has this—its urbanized west.

14:26.380 --> 14:32.940
These days, cities are the centers of wealth creation, but West Virginia barely has any—its

14:32.940 --> 14:36.900
largest is Charleston with a population of 47,000.

14:36.900 --> 14:41.500
Only Vermont has a smaller, largest city, even though West Virginia is far from the

14:41.500 --> 14:43.380
least populous state.

14:43.380 --> 14:47.860
Now, one of the effects of this is that the state lacks the wealthier urban areas that,

14:47.860 --> 14:52.660
in most states, pull the averages up on indicators like income, poverty, lifespan, and more,

14:53.020 --> 14:57.000
but there's also a far more real effect of a lack of spillover from urban to rural

14:57.000 --> 15:01.300
wealth through taxes, industry creation, and consumer spending.

15:01.300 --> 15:05.880
But there are cities in the broader region around—in fact, there are some of the wealthiest

15:05.880 --> 15:07.540
cities in the world.

15:07.540 --> 15:11.920
Therefore, the very factor that is holding the state's manufacturing and agriculture

15:11.920 --> 15:17.640
industries back can be a key asset for another sector—tourism.

15:17.640 --> 15:20.060
West Virginia has long recognized this.

15:20.060 --> 15:24.460
Its promise is demonstrated by places like Snowshoe, home to the mid-Atlantic's largest

15:24.460 --> 15:25.740
ski resort.

15:25.740 --> 15:30.160
With relatively high elevation and relatively large slopes, the resort offers arguably the

15:30.160 --> 15:34.560
best skiing experience one can get within a four-hour drive from DC.

15:34.560 --> 15:38.420
This and other outdoor experiences in the surrounding area not only attract tourists

15:38.420 --> 15:42.820
for a weekend, but tens of thousands have bought vacation homes in the area, which brings

15:42.820 --> 15:45.240
yet more spending to the state.

15:45.240 --> 15:50.620
And yet, Hocontis County, which encompasses the resort, sits at just about the state average

15:50.620 --> 15:52.660
for income and poverty.

15:52.660 --> 15:56.320
Its tourism industry has not fixed much.

15:56.320 --> 16:00.820
After all, while tourism can be big business, the employment that it creates is primarily

16:00.820 --> 16:05.920
in the service sector, whose wages are hardly better than other rural economic sectors.

16:05.920 --> 16:10.660
There's little path for someone working as a waiter or lift operator or housekeeper

16:10.660 --> 16:14.200
to work their way towards making a middle-class income.

16:14.200 --> 16:17.980
And other tourism-dependent economies have demonstrated that in cases where the industry

16:17.980 --> 16:22.760
grows successful enough to truly transform an area and push wages upwards, cost of living

16:22.760 --> 16:26.520
tends to rise in step, which dilutes any gains.

16:26.520 --> 16:30.960
The state is certainly trying other things—it's trying to attract remote workers to relocate,

16:30.960 --> 16:34.840
it's developing industrial parks, it's searching for funding for mine clean-up efforts—but

16:34.840 --> 16:39.740
the state has been trying to transition out of its coal dependency for decades upon decades

16:39.740 --> 16:43.120
upon decades and failing.

16:43.120 --> 16:48.320
There are plenty of economically inhospitable landscapes across America—across the world,

16:48.320 --> 16:49.320
even.

16:49.320 --> 16:55.000
But humans don't live in these areas because human migration tends to follow economic incentive.

16:55.000 --> 16:59.080
That was no different in West Virginia—people moved in as coal moved in.

16:59.080 --> 17:04.040
The reason why West Virginia seems to have such an acute issue is because there was that

17:04.040 --> 17:07.680
economic incentive, but now there isn't.

17:07.680 --> 17:11.720
There just aren't many other industries that pay living wages that this landscape

17:11.720 --> 17:18.600
can support, and therefore its population is left in a state of mere survival.

17:18.600 --> 17:23.220
Places like Appalachia are harbingers for the future that awaits if policymakers ignore

17:23.220 --> 17:27.280
the downstream effects of the transition to a greener grid.

17:27.280 --> 17:32.560
Coal as an industry is dying regardless, increasingly bested in price by renewable sources like

17:32.560 --> 17:38.280
solar, but as the mix of policy and economics spurs a similar result with other fossil fuels,

17:38.280 --> 17:43.380
more and more places risk sliding into a similar state of decay.

17:43.380 --> 17:47.920
In democratic political systems, the perpetual lack of solutions in places like West Virginia

17:47.920 --> 17:54.200
has and will continue to be a political barrier to the further decarbonization of the grid.

17:54.200 --> 17:58.080
Economic transition is therefore not just a matter of what's right or what's fair,

17:58.080 --> 18:02.700
but a practical necessity for achieving the most ambitious climate goals.

18:02.700 --> 18:08.120
If policymakers can intervene and successfully develop a viable rural economy in West Virginia,

18:08.120 --> 18:12.840
then perhaps Texas and Wyoming and North Dakota will have optimism for their futures

18:12.840 --> 18:14.240
beyond fossil fuels.

18:14.240 --> 18:19.800
But right now, the brutal truth is that history has given those living and working in fossil

18:19.800 --> 18:24.840
fuel-dependent places every reason to fight for the continuation of their industries.

18:24.840 --> 18:30.940
As much as it might feel regressive or selfish or backwards, it's also a pragmatic matter

18:30.940 --> 18:33.880
of self-survival.

18:33.880 --> 18:38.160
The impetus of the decline in Appalachian coal production is quite complex, but perhaps

18:38.160 --> 18:42.800
the largest factor is that the industry itself changed its operations in a way that made

18:42.800 --> 18:48.400
production out West, in places like Wyoming, far more cost-competitive than in West Virginia.

18:48.400 --> 18:52.300
As much as we wanted to cover that in this video, there just wasn't time, so rather

18:52.300 --> 18:57.080
we decided to make an entire episode of our series Logistics of X on how coal mining works,

18:57.080 --> 18:58.880
and why it moved out West.

18:58.880 --> 19:02.760
It's all far more complex and advanced than I ever could have imagined, and I think the

19:02.760 --> 19:06.880
bit that surprised me most is how few coalmines there really are these days—they're just

19:06.880 --> 19:11.400
operating at such a tremendous scale that the entire nation is largely supplied by just

19:11.400 --> 19:12.920
a few dozen mines.

19:12.920 --> 19:16.640
If you want to watch this, it's on Nebula, which I'm sure most of you have already

19:16.640 --> 19:20.000
heard about, but clearly you weren't convinced enough to sign up because you're watching

19:20.000 --> 19:22.620
this video on here and having to sit through an ad.

19:22.620 --> 19:27.040
On Nebula, myself and a curated group of around 200 creators upload every single one of our

19:27.040 --> 19:31.800
videos ad-free, but that's far from the only thing to make the platform worthwhile.

19:31.840 --> 19:36.000
I think the best part of Nebula is its originals, like the Logistics of X.

19:36.000 --> 19:40.200
There are plenty more by super-talented creators like Real Time History, both a series about

19:40.200 --> 19:44.560
the Soviet nuclear program and how it led to the Chernobyl disaster, and Real Life Lore,

19:44.560 --> 19:49.200
who makes the fantastic series Modern Conflicts diving deep into the day-to-day of the world's

19:49.200 --> 19:52.920
most consequential battles and wars in a way that's not even allowed on YouTube due to

19:52.920 --> 19:54.640
their content guidelines.

19:54.640 --> 19:58.960
Nebula was founded by creators, is owned by creators, and is run by creators to be the

19:58.960 --> 20:02.840
best home to the stuff we make, and we focus on building a business ecosystem that makes

20:02.840 --> 20:06.640
the job sustainable, which is part of the reason why, when you sign up at our link,

20:06.640 --> 20:10.900
nebula.tv slash wendover, we'll get a portion of your subscription fee for as long as you

20:10.900 --> 20:15.560
stay subscribed, which gives us stable, predictable monthly income that we can use to reinvest

20:15.560 --> 20:16.560
in the videos.

20:16.560 --> 20:21.400
But really, Nebula is just a good deal—you'll get access to tons of videos that you probably

20:21.400 --> 20:26.060
already watch ad-free, plus a huge catalog of top-quality original content from creators

20:26.060 --> 20:30.300
that you also probably already watch, and by using our link, it'll cost you just thirty

20:30.300 --> 20:34.980
dollars a year, which works out to only two dollars and fifty cents a month.

20:34.980 --> 20:39.700
So head to nebula.tv slash wendover to sign up and watch Logistics of X, and thanks in

20:39.700 --> 20:41.380
advance for your support.
