0	5200	The wealthiest county in America is not in Silicon Valley, it's not in New York, but
5200	9640	rather it's here—Loudon County, Virginia.
9640	14040	This DC suburb boasts the highest medium household income in the US.
14040	18640	What it lacks in billionaires, it makes up for with a massive upper-middle class working
18640	23920	six-figure desk jobs at government contractors—Northrop Grumman, Raytheon Technologies, New Star,
23920	28320	and more—leading to a landscape peppered with one, two, and three million dollar homes,
28320	33120	Ferrari, McLaren, and Rolls Royce dealerships, resorts, horse farms, and polo fields.
33120	38440	But perhaps the most bizarre part of Loudon County is its western border.
38440	44560	On one side is a place where the average household brings in $157,000 a year.
44560	50620	On the other is a state where that same average is less than $51,000.
50620	56140	In comparison to its mid-Atlantic surroundings, West Virginia sticks out remarkably.
56140	61580	Its GDP per capita is just $53,000—second lowest in the country.
61580	68100	Poverty is at 17.1%, fourth highest in the US, and far higher than the region around.
68100	73860	Life expectancy is just 74.7—second lowest in the US, and roughly equivalent to that
73860	76580	of the nation of Slovakia.
76580	82700	But beyond the statistics, at its core, West Virginia is, and long has been, a region in
82700	83700	decline.
84420	89980	Its population peaked the better part of a century ago, in 1950, and has been on a slow,
89980	92180	steady slide down ever since.
92180	97340	Nowadays, it's one of just three shrinking states, and it's by far on the fastest pace,
97340	102660	partially since year after year, unlike in every other American state, more people die
102660	103980	than are born.
103980	109100	Self-reported mental health is at an all-time low—in one study, the 13 American counties
109100	113160	with the worst scores were all in West Virginia.
113160	118200	Just as both a cause and effect of that, drug use is absolutely rampant.
118200	123080	Across one six-year span, pharmaceutical companies sold the equivalent of 400 opioid pills for
123080	128680	every person in West Virginia, and that was only the supposedly legal trade.
128680	134960	The state as a whole is in a bleak situation, but even within that average, there are shades
134960	136240	of bleakness.
136240	141720	Essentially every issue reaches its most acute form here—McDowell County.
141720	146280	This southernmost slice of the state regularly ranks as its poorest and one of the absolute
146280	147900	poorest in the nation.
147900	153480	Per capita income is just $14,000, which means the economic situation of its residents is
153480	158600	roughly analogous to that of those of the nation of Panama.
158600	164680	Life expectancy is just 70.4 years—the same as that of Iraq.
164680	170160	Having declined from a peak population of 100,000 to just 18,000 today, the landscape
170160	173000	is that of neglect.
173000	176120	Towns are mere shells of what was.
176120	180820	And few have fallen further than its county seat, Welch.
180820	185460	The Elkhorn Creek and Tug Fork cut right through its downtown, while the mountains rise straight
185460	186900	up above it.
186900	191960	Straddling such rough country, Welch has been forced to compromise, adopting not a traditional
191960	196220	grid, but a street pattern that follows the contours of the rivers below and the mountains
196220	197440	above.
197440	202740	And just as McDowell Street, Virginia Avenue, and US Route 52 follow the path cut by cascading
202740	207360	West Virginian waterways, so too does the railway—this single piece of infrastructure
207360	212880	that explains why this town, split by rivers, hemmed in by mountains in all directions,
212880	215720	even exists in the first place.
215720	220440	Before Welch, or McDowell County, or southern West Virginia was known for what it lacks,
220440	224280	where it falls behind, or why it's so different from the rest of the country, these rails
224280	228160	made this region the middle of American might.
228160	232200	Since before the Civil War, West Virginia's wealth in coal was well understood—it was
232200	235480	simply an issue of getting to the resource, then getting it out.
235480	239680	First, it was the east-west running Baltimore and Ohio line that connected northern coal
239680	244400	fields to midwest and eastern markets, then the Chesapeake and Ohio, and finally, near
244400	249580	centuries close, it was the Norfolk and western that collectively opened the state for business.
249580	254240	Now with the means to move it, the coal-rich West Virginia boomed from north to south.
254240	261240	From a state of 440,000 people in 1870, West Virginia nearly crested a million by 1900.
261240	264860	In the same span that the population more than doubled, coal production from the state
264860	272180	went from 600,000 tons to more than 22 million a year—almost a 40-fold increase.
272180	276920	Along railways, mines, and the other accompanying camps, tiny hamlets and company towns popped
276920	279580	up practically every other mile.
279580	282920	And the boom had only just begun.
282920	286780	According to the party, McDowell County now led the charge.
286780	290720	Connected to the rest of the nation by rail and home to the famed Pocahontas coal field,
290720	295280	the state's southernmost county became one of industrial America's most important.
295280	300280	US Coke and Coal, a subsidiary of the Titanic US Steel, set up the company town of Gary
300280	304380	to produce coke on site, and shipped to steel mills in the midwest, then it set up Gary
304380	310420	2, Gary 3, Gary 4, all the way through Gary 11, neighboring and competing with an array
310420	313060	of other privately-funded pop-up towns.
313060	317440	The interest in McDowell's bountiful endowments went beyond the private sector, too.
317440	322240	The US Navy also turned its attention to the region, as some Pocahontas coal burned so
322240	325080	clean that it became their first choice.
325080	329340	They called it smokeless coal, a relative term by today's standards, but the Navy
329340	333520	absolutely fired US warships with it all the way through the mid-century.
333520	338200	In just a matter of decades, McDowell, its county seat of Welch, and its quality Pocahontas
338200	342700	coal seams were the muscle behind American industry, and by filling the halls of Theodore
342700	347860	Roosevelt's Great White Fleet, had become the literal fuel of America's growing international
347860	348860	prestige.
348860	353080	As the 1900s progressed, some things changed.
353080	357220	With the onset of the labor movement, working conditions became less horrific, wages rose
357220	361500	and came to be paid with real currency rather than company currencies, while American naval
361500	364680	ships, then all ships, moved from coal to oil.
364680	369540	What remained consistent, though, was West Virginia's sole economic loyalty to coal
369540	370540	mining.
370540	376500	From 1910 to 1950, McDowell's population went from about 20,000 to nearly 100,000,
376500	381000	while statewide coal production now definitively outpaced all other contenders, under things
381000	387700	some 144 million tons of coal on the year—nearly 40 million more than the next highest producer,
387700	388700	Pennsylvania.
388700	393620	And leading the highest producing state was McDowell, now the nation's highest producing
393620	395220	county.
395220	397720	But then, more change.
397720	402060	Demand for coal in post-war America from traditional users diminished.
402060	407000	As American industry slowed, steel slowed, so demand for coke slowed.
407000	412200	Undeterred, West Virginia mines, rather than slowing production, pivoted to overseas export
412200	413780	and power generation.
413780	417620	As American environmental regulations and awareness pressured domestic coal-fired power
417620	422000	plants out of business, more coal went to energy-hungry markets like India.
422000	426720	As the world shifted, West Virginia found ways to keep shipping a product.
426720	431220	Not until 1997 did West Virginia finally reach peak production.
431220	436320	By this point, however, the connection between population, job creation, and production had
436320	438960	been long severed.
438960	443700	Since the 1950s, McDowell's population has been on the decline, in short, because
443700	444700	of machines.
444700	451040	Of the 25.5 million tons of coal produced in McDowell County in 1940, more than 23 million
451080	453960	tons were mined and loaded by hand.
453960	459480	Just ten years later, in 1950, of the county's nearly 21 million tons of produced coal, just
459480	464120	under 9 million were procured by hand, as cutting machines and conveyors had quickly
464120	465400	taken hold.
465400	469960	The result of such mechanization entirely decoupled McDowell's production from its
469960	475100	population as the county entered steady decline through the end of the century.
475100	479960	As margins tightened every time the industry had to pivot, it became more and more critical
479960	481400	to cut costs.
481400	486400	For those who stayed employed, the operational and managerial roles were solid middle-class
486400	491240	jobs, but jobs that were becoming rarer and rarer, and jobs that, as they dried up, simply
491240	496160	weren't being replaced within the borders of McDowell County, or for that matter, anywhere
496160	498200	within West Virginia.
498200	503600	Coal therefore cleanly explains West Virginia's fall, but it doesn't explain why it hasn't
503600	505760	been able to pick itself back up.
505760	510080	There are plenty of rural areas in the US, the majority of the country is rural, and
510080	513920	while there is a significant degree of economic disparity in comparison to the country's
513920	519120	urban areas, the rest of rural America is not nearly in such a dire state.
519120	522320	So why is West Virginia different?
522320	527120	The West Virginia Department of Economic Development strived to answer this question in their 2022
527120	528120	development plan.
528120	532320	They offered a handful of explanations for the state's poverty, but almost every cited
532320	538680	factor was simultaneously a cause and effect—crumbling infrastructure, lack of broadband access,
538680	542920	low education levels, poor health, abandoned urban areas.
542920	548440	Poverty is a vicious cycle—the state of poverty perpetuates poverty, but all cycles
548440	550520	have to have had a start.
550520	557360	The one cited factor that is not both a cause and effect, just merely a cause, was geography.
557400	561400	West Virginia is the least flat state in America.
561400	567640	Just 12% of its land is considered even relatively flat, and this one simple fact creates a web
567640	569120	of consequences.
569120	573680	The largest employment sector in rural America writ large, based on the census' sectoral
573680	578760	definitions, is the combination of educational services, healthcare, and social assistance.
578760	583480	This includes teachers, nurses, caregivers, and other people servicing jobs that exist
583480	585380	essentially everywhere.
585380	591760	The second largest rural economic sector is manufacturing, representing 12% of jobs outside
591760	592760	of urban areas.
592760	598980	As a proportion of overall US employment, it's still 9%, yet in West Virginia, an
598980	603340	almost entirely rural state, it's just 7%.
603340	608100	Now, the seven factories that the West Virginia Department of Economic Development touts as
608100	613780	top manufacturing-related businesses paint a picture as to why the sector struggles.
613780	618580	Everlight is in downtown Huntington, a city that developed across the naturally flat banks
618580	619900	of the Ohio River.
619900	624540	Kingsford Charcoal is in a more rural area, but along the also naturally flat banks of
624540	626540	the North Branch of the Potomac River.
626540	633380	Milan, Covestro, and Fiesta Tableware, too, are located in near-identical riverside spots.
633380	638380	The only of these seven not in a similar situation are American Woodmark and Procter & Gamble,
638380	642720	but they're both in the atypically flat eastern portion of the state.
642720	647720	More universally, manufacturers are not building factories on hillsides, and most of the elusive
647720	650960	flat spots are already developed.
650960	655420	The appeal of locating manufacturing in rural areas is the ability to achieve lower costs
655420	660880	through cheap labor and cheap land, but West Virginia lacks the second part of that equation.
660880	664600	Rather than spending to develop a site where it's tough or paying the premium for already
664600	669960	prepared spots, manufacturers can just go quite literally anywhere else.
670200	675520	Now, the weakness of the second largest rural economic sector is a problem in and of itself,
675520	677520	but its effects are disproportionate.
677520	682880	That's because average wages from the first and third largest rural economic sectors are
682880	686460	dramatically lower than those of manufacturing.
686460	692240	This sector, at least on average, is a key source of higher-pay, middle-class jobs in
692240	693640	rural America.
693640	698960	West Virginia, meanwhile, has to deal more with the lower-income sectors.
698960	703880	Of course, another major rural economic sector is agriculture, and agriculture has long been
703880	708200	a key part of West Virginia's economy, but the landscape that's been there for millennia
708200	711320	is presenting new challenges for the sector.
711320	714760	The state's geography is convoluted, but remarkably predictable.
714760	719160	Whereas, out west one tends to see massive mountains with proportionally larger valleys
719160	724180	in between, enough space for larger towns and productive agriculture, in West Virginia
724180	727280	the scale is shrunk down on both fronts.
727280	732440	That means that, consistently, towns pop up on flat sections of riverbank, then most valleys
732440	737440	are centered by a single road flanked by houses—areas known as hollows.
737440	741680	Sitting in between are the hills, which, by and large, are either destroyed by now-dead
741680	745380	coal mines or our untouched wilderness.
745380	747040	This has consequences.
747040	752440	First, there's little crop farming in West Virginia, the type that relies most on large
752440	754300	swaths of flat land.
754300	758620	The little that exists is primarily in the flatter eastern and northern sections.
758620	763540	The state focuses more on cattle and poultry, as this agricultural sector requires far less
763540	767020	land and produces far more value per unit of land.
767020	770620	But the farms that do exist are also small.
770620	775700	Whereas, across the US, approximately 11% of agricultural sales come from farms selling
775700	781180	less than $250,000 a year, 29% of West Virginia's do.
781180	784300	With hills sitting in the way, farms can only get so big.
784300	788900	In the past this was hardly a barrier, as most farms nationwide reached no larger than
788900	792540	what one family could manage, but that's no longer the case.
792540	797360	Much of the nation's cattle, for example, now comes from large, factory-style farms
797360	801620	like this, the Kismet, Kansas branch of cobalt cattle.
801620	806020	If one were to try to place this feedlot in West Virginia, it simply wouldn't fit.
806020	810660	But the reason why agribusiness is now the norm is because of the economies of scale
810660	811980	it unlocks.
811980	816380	Cobalt cattle is simply able to produce at a lower cost, which puts downward price pressure
816380	818360	on the industry as a whole.
818360	821980	That means these small family farms in West Virginia are having to sell their cattle for
821980	827060	less while still maintaining high operating prices, shrinking already narrow profit margins,
827060	830780	and putting this key economic sector on the path of decline.
830780	836220	It's therefore no wonder why the state's cattle inventory is at almost half of its
836220	838060	all-time high.
838060	843360	Of course, there are other places with land that is incompatible with agriculture or industry.
843360	848660	The vast majority of Nevada, for example, is simply too dry to make farming worthwhile.
848660	854240	Alaska, as another example, is simply too far for manufacturing to make sense.
854240	859300	Even neighboring Kentucky has near-identical geography inhibiting development in a near-identical
859300	866380	way, but crucially, it also has this—its urbanized west.
866380	872940	These days, cities are the centers of wealth creation, but West Virginia barely has any—its
872940	876900	largest is Charleston with a population of 47,000.
876900	881500	Only Vermont has a smaller, largest city, even though West Virginia is far from the
881500	883380	least populous state.
883380	887860	Now, one of the effects of this is that the state lacks the wealthier urban areas that,
887860	892660	in most states, pull the averages up on indicators like income, poverty, lifespan, and more,
893020	897000	but there's also a far more real effect of a lack of spillover from urban to rural
897000	901300	wealth through taxes, industry creation, and consumer spending.
901300	905880	But there are cities in the broader region around—in fact, there are some of the wealthiest
905880	907540	cities in the world.
907540	911920	Therefore, the very factor that is holding the state's manufacturing and agriculture
911920	917640	industries back can be a key asset for another sector—tourism.
917640	920060	West Virginia has long recognized this.
920060	924460	Its promise is demonstrated by places like Snowshoe, home to the mid-Atlantic's largest
924460	925740	ski resort.
925740	930160	With relatively high elevation and relatively large slopes, the resort offers arguably the
930160	934560	best skiing experience one can get within a four-hour drive from DC.
934560	938420	This and other outdoor experiences in the surrounding area not only attract tourists
938420	942820	for a weekend, but tens of thousands have bought vacation homes in the area, which brings
942820	945240	yet more spending to the state.
945240	950620	And yet, Hocontis County, which encompasses the resort, sits at just about the state average
950620	952660	for income and poverty.
952660	956320	Its tourism industry has not fixed much.
956320	960820	After all, while tourism can be big business, the employment that it creates is primarily
960820	965920	in the service sector, whose wages are hardly better than other rural economic sectors.
965920	970660	There's little path for someone working as a waiter or lift operator or housekeeper
970660	974200	to work their way towards making a middle-class income.
974200	977980	And other tourism-dependent economies have demonstrated that in cases where the industry
977980	982760	grows successful enough to truly transform an area and push wages upwards, cost of living
982760	986520	tends to rise in step, which dilutes any gains.
986520	990960	The state is certainly trying other things—it's trying to attract remote workers to relocate,
990960	994840	it's developing industrial parks, it's searching for funding for mine clean-up efforts—but
994840	999740	the state has been trying to transition out of its coal dependency for decades upon decades
999740	1003120	upon decades and failing.
1003120	1008320	There are plenty of economically inhospitable landscapes across America—across the world,
1008320	1009320	even.
1009320	1015000	But humans don't live in these areas because human migration tends to follow economic incentive.
1015000	1019080	That was no different in West Virginia—people moved in as coal moved in.
1019080	1024040	The reason why West Virginia seems to have such an acute issue is because there was that
1024040	1027680	economic incentive, but now there isn't.
1027680	1031720	There just aren't many other industries that pay living wages that this landscape
1031720	1038600	can support, and therefore its population is left in a state of mere survival.
1038600	1043220	Places like Appalachia are harbingers for the future that awaits if policymakers ignore
1043220	1047280	the downstream effects of the transition to a greener grid.
1047280	1052560	Coal as an industry is dying regardless, increasingly bested in price by renewable sources like
1052560	1058280	solar, but as the mix of policy and economics spurs a similar result with other fossil fuels,
1058280	1063380	more and more places risk sliding into a similar state of decay.
1063380	1067920	In democratic political systems, the perpetual lack of solutions in places like West Virginia
1067920	1074200	has and will continue to be a political barrier to the further decarbonization of the grid.
1074200	1078080	Economic transition is therefore not just a matter of what's right or what's fair,
1078080	1082700	but a practical necessity for achieving the most ambitious climate goals.
1082700	1088120	If policymakers can intervene and successfully develop a viable rural economy in West Virginia,
1088120	1092840	then perhaps Texas and Wyoming and North Dakota will have optimism for their futures
1092840	1094240	beyond fossil fuels.
1094240	1099800	But right now, the brutal truth is that history has given those living and working in fossil
1099800	1104840	fuel-dependent places every reason to fight for the continuation of their industries.
1104840	1110940	As much as it might feel regressive or selfish or backwards, it's also a pragmatic matter
1110940	1113880	of self-survival.
1113880	1118160	The impetus of the decline in Appalachian coal production is quite complex, but perhaps
1118160	1122800	the largest factor is that the industry itself changed its operations in a way that made
1122800	1128400	production out West, in places like Wyoming, far more cost-competitive than in West Virginia.
1128400	1132300	As much as we wanted to cover that in this video, there just wasn't time, so rather
1132300	1137080	we decided to make an entire episode of our series Logistics of X on how coal mining works,
1137080	1138880	and why it moved out West.
1138880	1142760	It's all far more complex and advanced than I ever could have imagined, and I think the
1142760	1146880	bit that surprised me most is how few coalmines there really are these days—they're just
1146880	1151400	operating at such a tremendous scale that the entire nation is largely supplied by just
1151400	1152920	a few dozen mines.
1152920	1156640	If you want to watch this, it's on Nebula, which I'm sure most of you have already
1156640	1160000	heard about, but clearly you weren't convinced enough to sign up because you're watching
1160000	1162620	this video on here and having to sit through an ad.
1162620	1167040	On Nebula, myself and a curated group of around 200 creators upload every single one of our
1167040	1171800	videos ad-free, but that's far from the only thing to make the platform worthwhile.
1171840	1176000	I think the best part of Nebula is its originals, like the Logistics of X.
1176000	1180200	There are plenty more by super-talented creators like Real Time History, both a series about
1180200	1184560	the Soviet nuclear program and how it led to the Chernobyl disaster, and Real Life Lore,
1184560	1189200	who makes the fantastic series Modern Conflicts diving deep into the day-to-day of the world's
1189200	1192920	most consequential battles and wars in a way that's not even allowed on YouTube due to
1192920	1194640	their content guidelines.
1194640	1198960	Nebula was founded by creators, is owned by creators, and is run by creators to be the
1198960	1202840	best home to the stuff we make, and we focus on building a business ecosystem that makes
1202840	1206640	the job sustainable, which is part of the reason why, when you sign up at our link,
1206640	1210900	nebula.tv slash wendover, we'll get a portion of your subscription fee for as long as you

1215560	1216560	in the videos.
1216560	1221400	But really, Nebula is just a good deal—you'll get access to tons of videos that you probably
1221400	1226060	already watch ad-free, plus a huge catalog of top-quality original content from creators
1226060	1230300	that you also probably already watch, and by using our link, it'll cost you just thirty
1230300	1234980	dollars a year, which works out to only two dollars and fifty cents a month.
