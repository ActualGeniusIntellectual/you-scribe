1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,200
The wealthiest county in America is not in Silicon Valley, it's not in New York, but

2
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:09,640
rather it's here—Loudon County, Virginia.

3
00:00:09,640 --> 00:00:14,040
This DC suburb boasts the highest medium household income in the US.

4
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:18,640
What it lacks in billionaires, it makes up for with a massive upper-middle class working

5
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:23,920
six-figure desk jobs at government contractors—Northrop Grumman, Raytheon Technologies, New Star,

6
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:28,320
and more—leading to a landscape peppered with one, two, and three million dollar homes,

7
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:33,120
Ferrari, McLaren, and Rolls Royce dealerships, resorts, horse farms, and polo fields.

8
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:38,440
But perhaps the most bizarre part of Loudon County is its western border.

9
00:00:38,440 --> 00:00:44,560
On one side is a place where the average household brings in $157,000 a year.

10
00:00:44,560 --> 00:00:50,620
On the other is a state where that same average is less than $51,000.

11
00:00:50,620 --> 00:00:56,140
In comparison to its mid-Atlantic surroundings, West Virginia sticks out remarkably.

12
00:00:56,140 --> 00:01:01,580
Its GDP per capita is just $53,000—second lowest in the country.

13
00:01:01,580 --> 00:01:08,100
Poverty is at 17.1%, fourth highest in the US, and far higher than the region around.

14
00:01:08,100 --> 00:01:13,860
Life expectancy is just 74.7—second lowest in the US, and roughly equivalent to that

15
00:01:13,860 --> 00:01:16,580
of the nation of Slovakia.

16
00:01:16,580 --> 00:01:22,700
But beyond the statistics, at its core, West Virginia is, and long has been, a region in

17
00:01:22,700 --> 00:01:23,700
decline.

18
00:01:24,420 --> 00:01:29,980
Its population peaked the better part of a century ago, in 1950, and has been on a slow,

19
00:01:29,980 --> 00:01:32,180
steady slide down ever since.

20
00:01:32,180 --> 00:01:37,340
Nowadays, it's one of just three shrinking states, and it's by far on the fastest pace,

21
00:01:37,340 --> 00:01:42,660
partially since year after year, unlike in every other American state, more people die

22
00:01:42,660 --> 00:01:43,980
than are born.

23
00:01:43,980 --> 00:01:49,100
Self-reported mental health is at an all-time low—in one study, the 13 American counties

24
00:01:49,100 --> 00:01:53,160
with the worst scores were all in West Virginia.

25
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:58,200
Just as both a cause and effect of that, drug use is absolutely rampant.

26
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:03,080
Across one six-year span, pharmaceutical companies sold the equivalent of 400 opioid pills for

27
00:02:03,080 --> 00:02:08,680
every person in West Virginia, and that was only the supposedly legal trade.

28
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:14,960
The state as a whole is in a bleak situation, but even within that average, there are shades

29
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:16,240
of bleakness.

30
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:21,720
Essentially every issue reaches its most acute form here—McDowell County.

31
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:26,280
This southernmost slice of the state regularly ranks as its poorest and one of the absolute

32
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:27,900
poorest in the nation.

33
00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:33,480
Per capita income is just $14,000, which means the economic situation of its residents is

34
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:38,600
roughly analogous to that of those of the nation of Panama.

35
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:44,680
Life expectancy is just 70.4 years—the same as that of Iraq.

36
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:50,160
Having declined from a peak population of 100,000 to just 18,000 today, the landscape

37
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:53,000
is that of neglect.

38
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:56,120
Towns are mere shells of what was.

39
00:02:56,120 --> 00:03:00,820
And few have fallen further than its county seat, Welch.

40
00:03:00,820 --> 00:03:05,460
The Elkhorn Creek and Tug Fork cut right through its downtown, while the mountains rise straight

41
00:03:05,460 --> 00:03:06,900
up above it.

42
00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:11,960
Straddling such rough country, Welch has been forced to compromise, adopting not a traditional

43
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:16,220
grid, but a street pattern that follows the contours of the rivers below and the mountains

44
00:03:16,220 --> 00:03:17,440
above.

45
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:22,740
And just as McDowell Street, Virginia Avenue, and US Route 52 follow the path cut by cascading

46
00:03:22,740 --> 00:03:27,360
West Virginian waterways, so too does the railway—this single piece of infrastructure

47
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:32,880
that explains why this town, split by rivers, hemmed in by mountains in all directions,

48
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:35,720
even exists in the first place.

49
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:40,440
Before Welch, or McDowell County, or southern West Virginia was known for what it lacks,

50
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:44,280
where it falls behind, or why it's so different from the rest of the country, these rails

51
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:48,160
made this region the middle of American might.

52
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:52,200
Since before the Civil War, West Virginia's wealth in coal was well understood—it was

53
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:55,480
simply an issue of getting to the resource, then getting it out.

54
00:03:55,480 --> 00:03:59,680
First, it was the east-west running Baltimore and Ohio line that connected northern coal

55
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:04,400
fields to midwest and eastern markets, then the Chesapeake and Ohio, and finally, near

56
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:09,580
centuries close, it was the Norfolk and western that collectively opened the state for business.

57
00:04:09,580 --> 00:04:14,240
Now with the means to move it, the coal-rich West Virginia boomed from north to south.

58
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:21,240
From a state of 440,000 people in 1870, West Virginia nearly crested a million by 1900.

59
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:24,860
In the same span that the population more than doubled, coal production from the state

60
00:04:24,860 --> 00:04:32,180
went from 600,000 tons to more than 22 million a year—almost a 40-fold increase.

61
00:04:32,180 --> 00:04:36,920
Along railways, mines, and the other accompanying camps, tiny hamlets and company towns popped

62
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:39,580
up practically every other mile.

63
00:04:39,580 --> 00:04:42,920
And the boom had only just begun.

64
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:46,780
According to the party, McDowell County now led the charge.

65
00:04:46,780 --> 00:04:50,720
Connected to the rest of the nation by rail and home to the famed Pocahontas coal field,

66
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:55,280
the state's southernmost county became one of industrial America's most important.

67
00:04:55,280 --> 00:05:00,280
US Coke and Coal, a subsidiary of the Titanic US Steel, set up the company town of Gary

68
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:04,380
to produce coke on site, and shipped to steel mills in the midwest, then it set up Gary

69
00:05:04,380 --> 00:05:10,420
2, Gary 3, Gary 4, all the way through Gary 11, neighboring and competing with an array

70
00:05:10,420 --> 00:05:13,060
of other privately-funded pop-up towns.

71
00:05:13,060 --> 00:05:17,440
The interest in McDowell's bountiful endowments went beyond the private sector, too.

72
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:22,240
The US Navy also turned its attention to the region, as some Pocahontas coal burned so

73
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:25,080
clean that it became their first choice.

74
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:29,340
They called it smokeless coal, a relative term by today's standards, but the Navy

75
00:05:29,340 --> 00:05:33,520
absolutely fired US warships with it all the way through the mid-century.

76
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:38,200
In just a matter of decades, McDowell, its county seat of Welch, and its quality Pocahontas

77
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:42,700
coal seams were the muscle behind American industry, and by filling the halls of Theodore

78
00:05:42,700 --> 00:05:47,860
Roosevelt's Great White Fleet, had become the literal fuel of America's growing international

79
00:05:47,860 --> 00:05:48,860
prestige.

80
00:05:48,860 --> 00:05:53,080
As the 1900s progressed, some things changed.

81
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:57,220
With the onset of the labor movement, working conditions became less horrific, wages rose

82
00:05:57,220 --> 00:06:01,500
and came to be paid with real currency rather than company currencies, while American naval

83
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:04,680
ships, then all ships, moved from coal to oil.

84
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:09,540
What remained consistent, though, was West Virginia's sole economic loyalty to coal

85
00:06:09,540 --> 00:06:10,540
mining.

86
00:06:10,540 --> 00:06:16,500
From 1910 to 1950, McDowell's population went from about 20,000 to nearly 100,000,

87
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:21,000
while statewide coal production now definitively outpaced all other contenders, under things

88
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:27,700
some 144 million tons of coal on the year—nearly 40 million more than the next highest producer,

89
00:06:27,700 --> 00:06:28,700
Pennsylvania.

90
00:06:28,700 --> 00:06:33,620
And leading the highest producing state was McDowell, now the nation's highest producing

91
00:06:33,620 --> 00:06:35,220
county.

92
00:06:35,220 --> 00:06:37,720
But then, more change.

93
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:42,060
Demand for coal in post-war America from traditional users diminished.

94
00:06:42,060 --> 00:06:47,000
As American industry slowed, steel slowed, so demand for coke slowed.

95
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:52,200
Undeterred, West Virginia mines, rather than slowing production, pivoted to overseas export

96
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:53,780
and power generation.

97
00:06:53,780 --> 00:06:57,620
As American environmental regulations and awareness pressured domestic coal-fired power

98
00:06:57,620 --> 00:07:02,000
plants out of business, more coal went to energy-hungry markets like India.

99
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:06,720
As the world shifted, West Virginia found ways to keep shipping a product.

100
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:11,220
Not until 1997 did West Virginia finally reach peak production.

101
00:07:11,220 --> 00:07:16,320
By this point, however, the connection between population, job creation, and production had

102
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:18,960
been long severed.

103
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:23,700
Since the 1950s, McDowell's population has been on the decline, in short, because

104
00:07:23,700 --> 00:07:24,700
of machines.

105
00:07:24,700 --> 00:07:31,040
Of the 25.5 million tons of coal produced in McDowell County in 1940, more than 23 million

106
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:33,960
tons were mined and loaded by hand.

107
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:39,480
Just ten years later, in 1950, of the county's nearly 21 million tons of produced coal, just

108
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:44,120
under 9 million were procured by hand, as cutting machines and conveyors had quickly

109
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:45,400
taken hold.

110
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:49,960
The result of such mechanization entirely decoupled McDowell's production from its

111
00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:55,100
population as the county entered steady decline through the end of the century.

112
00:07:55,100 --> 00:07:59,960
As margins tightened every time the industry had to pivot, it became more and more critical

113
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:01,400
to cut costs.

114
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:06,400
For those who stayed employed, the operational and managerial roles were solid middle-class

115
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:11,240
jobs, but jobs that were becoming rarer and rarer, and jobs that, as they dried up, simply

116
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:16,160
weren't being replaced within the borders of McDowell County, or for that matter, anywhere

117
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:18,200
within West Virginia.

118
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:23,600
Coal therefore cleanly explains West Virginia's fall, but it doesn't explain why it hasn't

119
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:25,760
been able to pick itself back up.

120
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:30,080
There are plenty of rural areas in the US, the majority of the country is rural, and

121
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:33,920
while there is a significant degree of economic disparity in comparison to the country's

122
00:08:33,920 --> 00:08:39,120
urban areas, the rest of rural America is not nearly in such a dire state.

123
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:42,320
So why is West Virginia different?

124
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:47,120
The West Virginia Department of Economic Development strived to answer this question in their 2022

125
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:48,120
development plan.

126
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:52,320
They offered a handful of explanations for the state's poverty, but almost every cited

127
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:58,680
factor was simultaneously a cause and effect—crumbling infrastructure, lack of broadband access,

128
00:08:58,680 --> 00:09:02,920
low education levels, poor health, abandoned urban areas.

129
00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:08,440
Poverty is a vicious cycle—the state of poverty perpetuates poverty, but all cycles

130
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:10,520
have to have had a start.

131
00:09:10,520 --> 00:09:17,360
The one cited factor that is not both a cause and effect, just merely a cause, was geography.

132
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:21,400
West Virginia is the least flat state in America.

133
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:27,640
Just 12% of its land is considered even relatively flat, and this one simple fact creates a web

134
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:29,120
of consequences.

135
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:33,680
The largest employment sector in rural America writ large, based on the census' sectoral

136
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:38,760
definitions, is the combination of educational services, healthcare, and social assistance.

137
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:43,480
This includes teachers, nurses, caregivers, and other people servicing jobs that exist

138
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:45,380
essentially everywhere.

139
00:09:45,380 --> 00:09:51,760
The second largest rural economic sector is manufacturing, representing 12% of jobs outside

140
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:52,760
of urban areas.

141
00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:58,980
As a proportion of overall US employment, it's still 9%, yet in West Virginia, an

142
00:09:58,980 --> 00:10:03,340
almost entirely rural state, it's just 7%.

143
00:10:03,340 --> 00:10:08,100
Now, the seven factories that the West Virginia Department of Economic Development touts as

144
00:10:08,100 --> 00:10:13,780
top manufacturing-related businesses paint a picture as to why the sector struggles.

145
00:10:13,780 --> 00:10:18,580
Everlight is in downtown Huntington, a city that developed across the naturally flat banks

146
00:10:18,580 --> 00:10:19,900
of the Ohio River.

147
00:10:19,900 --> 00:10:24,540
Kingsford Charcoal is in a more rural area, but along the also naturally flat banks of

148
00:10:24,540 --> 00:10:26,540
the North Branch of the Potomac River.

149
00:10:26,540 --> 00:10:33,380
Milan, Covestro, and Fiesta Tableware, too, are located in near-identical riverside spots.

150
00:10:33,380 --> 00:10:38,380
The only of these seven not in a similar situation are American Woodmark and Procter & Gamble,

151
00:10:38,380 --> 00:10:42,720
but they're both in the atypically flat eastern portion of the state.

152
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:47,720
More universally, manufacturers are not building factories on hillsides, and most of the elusive

153
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:50,960
flat spots are already developed.

154
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:55,420
The appeal of locating manufacturing in rural areas is the ability to achieve lower costs

155
00:10:55,420 --> 00:11:00,880
through cheap labor and cheap land, but West Virginia lacks the second part of that equation.

156
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:04,600
Rather than spending to develop a site where it's tough or paying the premium for already

157
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:09,960
prepared spots, manufacturers can just go quite literally anywhere else.

158
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:15,520
Now, the weakness of the second largest rural economic sector is a problem in and of itself,

159
00:11:15,520 --> 00:11:17,520
but its effects are disproportionate.

160
00:11:17,520 --> 00:11:22,880
That's because average wages from the first and third largest rural economic sectors are

161
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:26,460
dramatically lower than those of manufacturing.

162
00:11:26,460 --> 00:11:32,240
This sector, at least on average, is a key source of higher-pay, middle-class jobs in

163
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:33,640
rural America.

164
00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:38,960
West Virginia, meanwhile, has to deal more with the lower-income sectors.

165
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:43,880
Of course, another major rural economic sector is agriculture, and agriculture has long been

166
00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:48,200
a key part of West Virginia's economy, but the landscape that's been there for millennia

167
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:51,320
is presenting new challenges for the sector.

168
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:54,760
The state's geography is convoluted, but remarkably predictable.

169
00:11:54,760 --> 00:11:59,160
Whereas, out west one tends to see massive mountains with proportionally larger valleys

170
00:11:59,160 --> 00:12:04,180
in between, enough space for larger towns and productive agriculture, in West Virginia

171
00:12:04,180 --> 00:12:07,280
the scale is shrunk down on both fronts.

172
00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:12,440
That means that, consistently, towns pop up on flat sections of riverbank, then most valleys

173
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:17,440
are centered by a single road flanked by houses—areas known as hollows.

174
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:21,680
Sitting in between are the hills, which, by and large, are either destroyed by now-dead

175
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:25,380
coal mines or our untouched wilderness.

176
00:12:25,380 --> 00:12:27,040
This has consequences.

177
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:32,440
First, there's little crop farming in West Virginia, the type that relies most on large

178
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:34,300
swaths of flat land.

179
00:12:34,300 --> 00:12:38,620
The little that exists is primarily in the flatter eastern and northern sections.

180
00:12:38,620 --> 00:12:43,540
The state focuses more on cattle and poultry, as this agricultural sector requires far less

181
00:12:43,540 --> 00:12:47,020
land and produces far more value per unit of land.

182
00:12:47,020 --> 00:12:50,620
But the farms that do exist are also small.

183
00:12:50,620 --> 00:12:55,700
Whereas, across the US, approximately 11% of agricultural sales come from farms selling

184
00:12:55,700 --> 00:13:01,180
less than $250,000 a year, 29% of West Virginia's do.

185
00:13:01,180 --> 00:13:04,300
With hills sitting in the way, farms can only get so big.

186
00:13:04,300 --> 00:13:08,900
In the past this was hardly a barrier, as most farms nationwide reached no larger than

187
00:13:08,900 --> 00:13:12,540
what one family could manage, but that's no longer the case.

188
00:13:12,540 --> 00:13:17,360
Much of the nation's cattle, for example, now comes from large, factory-style farms

189
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:21,620
like this, the Kismet, Kansas branch of cobalt cattle.

190
00:13:21,620 --> 00:13:26,020
If one were to try to place this feedlot in West Virginia, it simply wouldn't fit.

191
00:13:26,020 --> 00:13:30,660
But the reason why agribusiness is now the norm is because of the economies of scale

192
00:13:30,660 --> 00:13:31,980
it unlocks.

193
00:13:31,980 --> 00:13:36,380
Cobalt cattle is simply able to produce at a lower cost, which puts downward price pressure

194
00:13:36,380 --> 00:13:38,360
on the industry as a whole.

195
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:41,980
That means these small family farms in West Virginia are having to sell their cattle for

196
00:13:41,980 --> 00:13:47,060
less while still maintaining high operating prices, shrinking already narrow profit margins,

197
00:13:47,060 --> 00:13:50,780
and putting this key economic sector on the path of decline.

198
00:13:50,780 --> 00:13:56,220
It's therefore no wonder why the state's cattle inventory is at almost half of its

199
00:13:56,220 --> 00:13:58,060
all-time high.

200
00:13:58,060 --> 00:14:03,360
Of course, there are other places with land that is incompatible with agriculture or industry.

201
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:08,660
The vast majority of Nevada, for example, is simply too dry to make farming worthwhile.

202
00:14:08,660 --> 00:14:14,240
Alaska, as another example, is simply too far for manufacturing to make sense.

203
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:19,300
Even neighboring Kentucky has near-identical geography inhibiting development in a near-identical

204
00:14:19,300 --> 00:14:26,380
way, but crucially, it also has this—its urbanized west.

205
00:14:26,380 --> 00:14:32,940
These days, cities are the centers of wealth creation, but West Virginia barely has any—its

206
00:14:32,940 --> 00:14:36,900
largest is Charleston with a population of 47,000.

207
00:14:36,900 --> 00:14:41,500
Only Vermont has a smaller, largest city, even though West Virginia is far from the

208
00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:43,380
least populous state.

209
00:14:43,380 --> 00:14:47,860
Now, one of the effects of this is that the state lacks the wealthier urban areas that,

210
00:14:47,860 --> 00:14:52,660
in most states, pull the averages up on indicators like income, poverty, lifespan, and more,

211
00:14:53,020 --> 00:14:57,000
but there's also a far more real effect of a lack of spillover from urban to rural

212
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:01,300
wealth through taxes, industry creation, and consumer spending.

213
00:15:01,300 --> 00:15:05,880
But there are cities in the broader region around—in fact, there are some of the wealthiest

214
00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:07,540
cities in the world.

215
00:15:07,540 --> 00:15:11,920
Therefore, the very factor that is holding the state's manufacturing and agriculture

216
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:17,640
industries back can be a key asset for another sector—tourism.

217
00:15:17,640 --> 00:15:20,060
West Virginia has long recognized this.

218
00:15:20,060 --> 00:15:24,460
Its promise is demonstrated by places like Snowshoe, home to the mid-Atlantic's largest

219
00:15:24,460 --> 00:15:25,740
ski resort.

220
00:15:25,740 --> 00:15:30,160
With relatively high elevation and relatively large slopes, the resort offers arguably the

221
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:34,560
best skiing experience one can get within a four-hour drive from DC.

222
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:38,420
This and other outdoor experiences in the surrounding area not only attract tourists

223
00:15:38,420 --> 00:15:42,820
for a weekend, but tens of thousands have bought vacation homes in the area, which brings

224
00:15:42,820 --> 00:15:45,240
yet more spending to the state.

225
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:50,620
And yet, Hocontis County, which encompasses the resort, sits at just about the state average

226
00:15:50,620 --> 00:15:52,660
for income and poverty.

227
00:15:52,660 --> 00:15:56,320
Its tourism industry has not fixed much.

228
00:15:56,320 --> 00:16:00,820
After all, while tourism can be big business, the employment that it creates is primarily

229
00:16:00,820 --> 00:16:05,920
in the service sector, whose wages are hardly better than other rural economic sectors.

230
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:10,660
There's little path for someone working as a waiter or lift operator or housekeeper

231
00:16:10,660 --> 00:16:14,200
to work their way towards making a middle-class income.

232
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:17,980
And other tourism-dependent economies have demonstrated that in cases where the industry

233
00:16:17,980 --> 00:16:22,760
grows successful enough to truly transform an area and push wages upwards, cost of living

234
00:16:22,760 --> 00:16:26,520
tends to rise in step, which dilutes any gains.

235
00:16:26,520 --> 00:16:30,960
The state is certainly trying other things—it's trying to attract remote workers to relocate,

236
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:34,840
it's developing industrial parks, it's searching for funding for mine clean-up efforts—but

237
00:16:34,840 --> 00:16:39,740
the state has been trying to transition out of its coal dependency for decades upon decades

238
00:16:39,740 --> 00:16:43,120
upon decades and failing.

239
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:48,320
There are plenty of economically inhospitable landscapes across America—across the world,

240
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:49,320
even.

241
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:55,000
But humans don't live in these areas because human migration tends to follow economic incentive.

242
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:59,080
That was no different in West Virginia—people moved in as coal moved in.

243
00:16:59,080 --> 00:17:04,040
The reason why West Virginia seems to have such an acute issue is because there was that

244
00:17:04,040 --> 00:17:07,680
economic incentive, but now there isn't.

245
00:17:07,680 --> 00:17:11,720
There just aren't many other industries that pay living wages that this landscape

246
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:18,600
can support, and therefore its population is left in a state of mere survival.

247
00:17:18,600 --> 00:17:23,220
Places like Appalachia are harbingers for the future that awaits if policymakers ignore

248
00:17:23,220 --> 00:17:27,280
the downstream effects of the transition to a greener grid.

249
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:32,560
Coal as an industry is dying regardless, increasingly bested in price by renewable sources like

250
00:17:32,560 --> 00:17:38,280
solar, but as the mix of policy and economics spurs a similar result with other fossil fuels,

251
00:17:38,280 --> 00:17:43,380
more and more places risk sliding into a similar state of decay.

252
00:17:43,380 --> 00:17:47,920
In democratic political systems, the perpetual lack of solutions in places like West Virginia

253
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:54,200
has and will continue to be a political barrier to the further decarbonization of the grid.

254
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:58,080
Economic transition is therefore not just a matter of what's right or what's fair,

255
00:17:58,080 --> 00:18:02,700
but a practical necessity for achieving the most ambitious climate goals.

256
00:18:02,700 --> 00:18:08,120
If policymakers can intervene and successfully develop a viable rural economy in West Virginia,

257
00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:12,840
then perhaps Texas and Wyoming and North Dakota will have optimism for their futures

258
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:14,240
beyond fossil fuels.

259
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:19,800
But right now, the brutal truth is that history has given those living and working in fossil

260
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:24,840
fuel-dependent places every reason to fight for the continuation of their industries.

261
00:18:24,840 --> 00:18:30,940
As much as it might feel regressive or selfish or backwards, it's also a pragmatic matter

262
00:18:30,940 --> 00:18:33,880
of self-survival.

263
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:38,160
The impetus of the decline in Appalachian coal production is quite complex, but perhaps

264
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:42,800
the largest factor is that the industry itself changed its operations in a way that made

265
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:48,400
production out West, in places like Wyoming, far more cost-competitive than in West Virginia.

266
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:52,300
As much as we wanted to cover that in this video, there just wasn't time, so rather

267
00:18:52,300 --> 00:18:57,080
we decided to make an entire episode of our series Logistics of X on how coal mining works,

268
00:18:57,080 --> 00:18:58,880
and why it moved out West.

269
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:02,760
It's all far more complex and advanced than I ever could have imagined, and I think the

270
00:19:02,760 --> 00:19:06,880
bit that surprised me most is how few coalmines there really are these days—they're just

271
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:11,400
operating at such a tremendous scale that the entire nation is largely supplied by just

272
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:12,920
a few dozen mines.

273
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:16,640
If you want to watch this, it's on Nebula, which I'm sure most of you have already

274
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:20,000
heard about, but clearly you weren't convinced enough to sign up because you're watching

275
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,620
this video on here and having to sit through an ad.

276
00:19:22,620 --> 00:19:27,040
On Nebula, myself and a curated group of around 200 creators upload every single one of our

277
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:31,800
videos ad-free, but that's far from the only thing to make the platform worthwhile.

278
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:36,000
I think the best part of Nebula is its originals, like the Logistics of X.

279
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:40,200
There are plenty more by super-talented creators like Real Time History, both a series about

280
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:44,560
the Soviet nuclear program and how it led to the Chernobyl disaster, and Real Life Lore,

281
00:19:44,560 --> 00:19:49,200
who makes the fantastic series Modern Conflicts diving deep into the day-to-day of the world's

282
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:52,920
most consequential battles and wars in a way that's not even allowed on YouTube due to

283
00:19:52,920 --> 00:19:54,640
their content guidelines.

284
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:58,960
Nebula was founded by creators, is owned by creators, and is run by creators to be the

285
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:02,840
best home to the stuff we make, and we focus on building a business ecosystem that makes

286
00:20:02,840 --> 00:20:06,640
the job sustainable, which is part of the reason why, when you sign up at our link,

287

289
00:20:15,560 --> 00:20:16,560
in the videos.

290
00:20:16,560 --> 00:20:21,400
But really, Nebula is just a good deal—you'll get access to tons of videos that you probably

291
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:26,060
already watch ad-free, plus a huge catalog of top-quality original content from creators

292
00:20:26,060 --> 00:20:30,300
that you also probably already watch, and by using our link, it'll cost you just thirty

293
00:20:30,300 --> 00:20:34,980
dollars a year, which works out to only two dollars and fifty cents a month.

294
00:20:34,980 --> 00:20:39,700
So head to nebula.tv slash wendover to sign up and watch Logistics of X, and thanks in
