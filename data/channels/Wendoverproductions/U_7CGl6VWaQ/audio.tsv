0	6440	The world's new era of warfare started here, on the eighth floor of an innocuous office
6440	9400	building in Minsk, Belarus.
9400	15360	A small anti-virus developer based within these walls, Virus Blockada, received an inbound
15360	16740	help request.
16740	22120	Their client in Iran was experiencing random, repeated reboots of their industrial-control
22120	23120	computers.
23120	28040	It was probably a bug, they thought—a misconfiguration of Windows, or an issue of two programs not
28040	29760	playing nice with each other.
29760	34220	So, they reinstalled Windows, but the issue remained.
34220	35600	This upped the stakes.
35600	40360	This wasn't some mistake in Windows programming—this was something purposefully malicious.
40360	46200	Soon, Sergei Ulasin, the company's researcher, found some suspicious files on the errant
46200	47320	machine.
47320	51640	As he combed through their code, he made a discovery—a discovery that shook the world
51640	55400	of information security to its core.
55400	60480	This code, when placed on a USB drive and plugged into a computer, could silently launch
60480	64340	and execute a program simply by being viewed.
64340	69280	This was a brand new exploit—a catastrophically capable exploit.
69280	74420	All it took was one drive, simply plugged in, to infect one computer.
74420	79240	This method of spread was mortifyingly efficient—it was something out of a movie.
79240	83720	Recognizing that, the intuitive question was how far it had spread.
83720	85720	The answer was chilling.
85720	86720	58%.
86720	92600	58% of devices in Iran were infected with this malicious code.
92600	97880	58% of the country's computers were within the grips of some mystery developer so capable
97880	101960	that they had identified an exploit of existential proportions.
101960	106140	And what made this ominous development all that much more intimidating was that nobody
106140	109740	knew what this code was intended to do.
109740	115940	Nobody knew why a high-skilled hacker had spread a groundbreaking worm to 58% of Iran's
115940	116940	computers.
116940	121540	What became clear far quicker is that Virus Blocka does discovery did not gain prominence
121540	126540	for the virus itself—it gained prominence because this small Belarusian antivirus company
126540	130640	had discovered that the world had entered a new era.
130640	138520	The world had entered the era of highly advanced, highly targeted, and highly capable cyber-warfare.
138520	144140	This new era was made possible, and perhaps more importantly, made profitable by one single
144140	147060	concept—the Zero Day.
147060	152060	You see, in decades past, national intelligence agencies and nefarious independent operatives
152060	155280	focused on gathering information in transit.
155280	158540	Rather than sneaking into the embassy, you intercepted the courier.
158540	161900	Rather than placing a bug in the phone, you tapped the transmission line.
161900	166840	It was simply easier to capture information on the move than at its origin or destination.
166840	171940	As the digital age awoke, this MO continued, but then the manufacturers caught up.
171940	177640	Apple, Microsoft, Google, and others all started encrypting data as soon as it left devices.
177640	183320	Shielding information behind complex mathematical systems, encryption, by this time, was, for
183320	186020	all practical purposes, perfect.
186020	190280	Therefore, the strategies behind digital espionage had to change.
190280	193040	The snoops needed a new way to get in.
193140	197180	While the math behind encryption may be infallible, people are not.
197180	201980	The devices on which data is created and stored—phones, computers, servers, and more—are created
201980	202980	by people.
202980	205860	Therefore, the devices have holes.
205860	209440	These holes are referred to as Zero Days.
209440	211780	Any software has vulnerabilities.
211780	215140	Most will be caught before release, some will be caught shortly after and quickly addressed
215140	220560	with a patch, but a tiny minority will go unnoticed for weeks, months, or years.
220580	225140	In the early 2000s, hobbyist hackers spent their evenings scrolling through code, looking
225140	226700	for these bugs.
226700	230020	Faced with hostility and legal threats when reporting vulnerabilities straight to its
230020	234460	software's developers, many would post about their findings on online forums—earning
234460	236520	little else than bragging rights.
236520	240240	Early information security companies would repackage this information and include it
240240	245160	in a digital threat alert system for companies and agencies—notifying them when their software
245160	248100	might have holes not yet fixed by the developer.
248120	254200	One such company, iDefense, found itself faltering in 2002 as they were selling the same information
254200	259960	at the same time to the same customer base—they simply had zero competitive advantage.
259960	262000	So, they created one.
262000	264920	They decided to start paying for exploits.
264920	268560	Hackers would come to them with a bug, and, in exchange for their silence, iDefense would
268560	272480	pay anywhere between a couple hundred and a couple thousand dollars.
272480	276520	iDefense would then alert their software's developer and its own customers before the
276540	279260	competing information security companies could.
279260	283360	With the information staying among more trusted hands, this also lowered the likelihood of
283360	286520	a vulnerability being used for nefarious reasons.
286520	291220	iDefense had created an ethical, profitable system that gave hackers a first opportunity
291220	297600	to monetize their hobby, and so it was no surprise that it grew into a massive success.
297600	304080	In mere months, the company went from weeks behind on payroll to a pioneer in the industry.
304140	308980	But then the calls started coming, and the area codes were local.
308980	314180	The Chantilly, Virginia-based company was fielding inquiries from around the DC Beltway.
314180	317140	Government contractors wanted to buy their exploits.
317140	322380	For the zero days that iDefense had paid three or four figures for, the callers were willing
322380	327780	to pay six—as long as the company stayed quiet, as long as the buyer stayed the only
327780	330220	one with knowledge of the zero day.
330240	336160	iDefense said no, but they soon found themselves priced out of the very market they had created.
336160	341000	Whereas their payouts might fund a vacation, the black market bounties paid for sports
341000	344320	cars—they simply couldn't compete.
344320	349360	On the other side of the equation, the American military machine had recognized the astonishing
349360	353340	potential rising out of a single software susceptibility.
353340	358600	Unperturbed by borders, rules of engagement, or mortality, cyberwarfare had the potential
358600	364260	to silently achieve America's strategic goals so long as they, and only they, knew
364260	366700	about these zero days.
366700	372580	In the years since, the market has propagated into a staggering degree of scale and legitimacy.
372580	376620	While a thriving black and gray market still exists, especially for sales to countries
376620	380940	with concerning human rights records, Western players like the US source the zero day exploits
380940	385460	upon which they build their cyberweapons from companies that hardly hide what they're
385460	386460	doing.
386460	391400	For this extreme example, zero day broker Zerodium publishes their price list.
391400	395400	For an exploit capable of running a piece of code on a device or network without user
395400	399720	interaction, remote code execution as it's known, the company is willing to pay up to
399720	402040	$10,000 on router software.
402040	407740	For the same capability, they'll pay up to $100,000 on WordPress, and up to a million
407740	409440	dollars for Windows.
409440	415000	Zerodium is even offering a temporarily higher $400,000 bounty for a remote code execution
415000	420400	zero day on Microsoft Outlook—possibly indicating that someone, somewhere desperately
420400	424360	needs that very exploit for a cyberweapon under development.
424360	428580	Remote code execution exploits are the holy grail of zero days.
428580	433200	Properly used, they can allow virtually unfettered access to another's machine.
433200	438580	Of course, zero days become worthless essentially the instant they are discovered—nowadays,
438580	441780	software developers will quickly patch the exploits upon notification.
441840	446480	Therefore, the fact that this malicious code, quickly dubbed Stuxnet, included a remote
446480	451000	code execution exploit that could have sold for hundreds of thousands of dollars, indicated
451000	454360	that it was designed to do something equally valuable.
454360	461000	However, it soon became clear that the .lnk exploit did not stand alone.
461000	466460	Layered on top of it was another remote code execution exploit.
466460	470700	Stuxnet was designed to embed itself into the file that communicates metadata to printers
470700	476000	on a local network, however, with this zero day, that file would end up on all the other
476000	481820	computers on that local network—silently and quickly spreading from a single machine
481820	486320	to an entire office, university, factory, or other facility.
486320	492340	Then, to complete the spread, the code used two Escalation of Privilege zero days, each
492340	496760	for different versions of the operating system, allowing it, when installed on a single user
496760	500900	account, to gain access to an entire machine.
500900	505880	Four zero days, four exploits each worth life-changing amounts of money.
505880	512220	This was, in the most literal sense, an unprecedented scale of hacking device.
512220	517820	Never before had a piece of code so expertly intertwined four unknown exploits.
517820	522940	Whoever was behind this had exhausted enormous resources onto this single, one megabyte piece
522940	527540	of code, but even as it was being combed through by Virus Blockita—even as it set
527540	532520	the information security industry ablaze, even as it propagated from machine to machine
532520	538980	in Iran and beyond—the single most important question remained unanswered.
538980	543060	What was Stuxnet designed to do?
543060	548060	This is the Natanz nuclear facility, and while neither Iranian officials nor anyone in global
548060	553060	information security knew it, by the middle of 2010, the complex had become ground zero
553060	558180	for the implementation of the most advanced cyberweapon the world had ever seen.
558180	561900	Hours away from Tehran by car, sitting on the border of the nation's central desert
561900	567040	in the shadow of the carcass mountains, this uranium enrichment facility is purposefully
567040	569060	geographically isolated.
569060	574260	Its geographic isolation, however, pales in comparison to its digital isolation.
574260	579300	Natanz, in response to an earlier, more rudimentary cyberattack, wasn't even connected to the
579300	584060	internet as Iran had air-gapped the facility to protect important and notoriously fickle
584060	586220	centrifuges from outside meddling.
586220	590540	For the outside to meddle, then, a worm had to be planted manually.
590540	596920	At some point in 2009, an unknowing employee at the plant, a spy, or a mole plugged a contaminated
596920	600820	USB stick into a PC running Microsoft Windows.
600820	604780	Having the malware past the air-gap, however, only marked the beginning.
604780	610820	First, using the .lnk zero-day, the worm jumped from USB to computer without detection.
610820	615540	Then, using the printer zero-day vulnerability, the worm gained access to the facility's
615540	619140	local network and spread across the entire enrichment plant.
619140	624900	Undetected, and inside the Natanz network, the malicious code still held on to its payload—continuing
624900	628700	its search for a very particular target, as it went.
628700	632020	Conceptually, cyberweapons are rather straightforward.
632020	636940	Like most of their physical counterparts, these weapons consist of two primary components—the
636940	638780	carrier and the payload.
638780	643660	In other words, no matter the level of complexity, every cyberweapon is comprised of code that
643660	648380	gains it access into a computer or network, and code that informs what the weapon does
648380	649760	once it's inside.
649760	653060	At this stage, the carrier had so far succeeded.
653060	657180	Stuxnet had access to any and all things going on here, throughout the administrative and
657180	663280	monitoring areas of the facility—effectively, the enrichment processes surrounding infrastructure.
663280	667580	The code's payload and, by extension, the malware's authors, however, weren't interested
667580	672300	in crashing the plant's communications network or delivering a one-off denial of service.
672300	677020	Instead, they worked towards something more tangible and long-lasting.
677020	683140	What the code wanted access to was buried underground here, where actual, physical centrifuges
683140	689340	were using centrifugal force to tear away unwanted isotopes and create Uranium-235.
689340	695580	Running these centrifuges, though, weren't PCs, but programmable logic controllers—industrial
695580	699260	control equipment that provided yet another hurdle for the malware.
699260	703580	Finally, using stolen security certificates than zero-day vulnerabilities identified in
703580	709200	Siemens Software, a German manufacturer whose PLCs controlled 164 of the Iranian centrifuges
709200	715640	each, the carrier had reached its target, completed its mission, and released its payload.
715640	720600	Among the many genius and frightening potentials highlighted by this nefarious code, one troubling
720600	725180	aspect lies not in what it did, but what it intended not to do.
725180	730020	For days after gaining access to the PLCs controlling the Iranian centrifuges, the very
730020	735920	core of the nation's nuclear program, the payload did nothing but monitor the machine's
735920	736920	RPMs.
736920	742760	Then, after nearly two weeks, the code would briefly speed the centrifuges up to 1400 Hz—well
742760	746780	beyond their normal operating range of between 800 and 1100.
746780	750920	Weeks after that, the code would momentarily slow them down to 2 Hz, leading to increased
750920	753680	wear and tear, and thus failure.
753680	758000	All the while, as the machines self-destructed at a slightly above average rate, the worm
758000	762200	reported to monitors that the centrifuges were running at average RPMs—that there
762200	764440	was nothing here to see.
764440	769200	Essentially, had it not managed to unintentionally escape from the facility, Stuxnet could have
769200	774360	potentially continued to cripple Iran's nuclear ambitions from within for years, perhaps
774360	776880	even decades, before detection.
776880	782880	Therefore, prior to June of 2010, the piece of code was simultaneously invisible and physically
782880	788160	destructive—a cyberweapon experts couldn't identify, but one that was destroying hundreds
788160	792680	upon hundreds of strategically invaluable Iranian centrifuges.
792680	797520	It's been more than a decade since Stuxnet was first identified.
797520	803100	Still, no one has officially claimed responsibility for this first-of-a-kind weapon.
803100	807580	The code's scale, though—its sheer size and complexity—has created a consensus that
807580	809920	this couldn't be the work of one person.
809920	813480	While the world's most powerful hackers are likely to get their hands on a single
813480	817800	zero day, Stuxnet employed a staggering four.
817800	822400	Nor could this be the work of a group of activists, or even a minor nation-state, either.
822400	827960	At a megabyte, Stuxnet was orders of magnitude larger than any malware discovered before
827960	828960	it.
828960	833520	And it wasn't just massive, either—it was incredibly precise, laying dormant in
833520	838040	computers across the globe and only weaponizing its devious payload when connecting to Siemens
838040	844000	Step 7 software linked to a PLC running exactly 164 centrifuges.
844000	848440	Such size signaled that this was a weapon designed across years, while such clinical
848440	853040	precision signaled the code was crafted with potential future lawsuits in mind.
853040	858820	In short, just in the worm's design, experts the world over concluded it had to be crafted
858820	863660	by a major world power, or multiple, with the time and resources to approach such an
863660	868880	unprecedented undertaking, and it had to be a world power, or multiple, that wasn't
868880	871400	so friendly with Iran.
871400	875680	Information in the actual code and geopolitical context aren't our only clues as to who
875680	877540	is behind this, though.
877540	881940	The experts have conducted countless interviews on background and pored over troves of leaked
881940	884540	documents since the worm appeared.
884540	888980	What they found was that the development of Stuxnet was described as a third option, that
888980	892900	existed somewhere between doing nothing to slow Iran's nuclear advance and launching
892900	896080	airstrikes to destroy the enrichment facilities.
896080	900860	As an alternative was how the weapon was first presented to President Bush, then to Israeli
900860	906980	officials, then eventually to President Obama—all of whom supported its implementation.
906980	911300	What the journalists revealed was that the US and Israel had ushered the world into a
911300	916780	new era of state-led cyberoffensive that wreaked physical destruction.
916780	921020	Before this point, nation-states—the US through the NSA and Israel through its unit
921020	925340	8200—used cyberdivisions to defend and surveil.
925340	928420	Now they were going on the offensive.
928420	933440	By crossing the Rubicon, though, and getting caught, the actions of the US and Israel have
933440	935860	opened Pandora's box.
935860	942220	Though Iran denied involvement, in 2013, major American banks were hit with a concerted attack.
942220	947040	American intelligence identified it as retaliation by Iranian, and a worrying lesson as to how
947040	950620	quickly the rival's cyber capabilities were expanding.
950620	956060	Holding up American banks in 2013, however, only marked the beginning.
956060	961740	Once the US unleashed Duxnet, other nation-states have worked to close the cyberweapon gap—many
961740	965860	of which the US has, at best, a tenuous relationship with.
965860	970220	North Korea, largely through its state-backed hack organization the Lazarus Group, was able
970220	975980	to infiltrate Sony Pictures in 2014, then in 2017, the country's WannaCry ransomware
975980	980500	forced the UK's National Health Service to work off pen and paper.
980500	985260	Every year, China's cyberwarfare division grows stronger from the talent-scouted and
985260	990420	zero-days identified at the Tianfu Cup, where competitive hackers tear into Google, Microsoft,
990420	991700	and Apple software.
991700	997400	In 2017, Russian cyberattacks brought Ukrainian banks, utilities, and government agencies
997400	998580	to their knees.
998580	1003820	In 2021, ransomware software locked up the US's colonial pipeline.
1003820	1007460	Increasing the speed at which the rest of the world catches up to the US is the fact
1007460	1009780	that American weapons are spreading.
1009780	1014420	The United States has long been considered a leader, if not the leader, in cyberwarfare,
1014420	1019180	but a 2017 leak by a hacker group known as the Shadow Brokers unleashed the American
1019180	1022740	NSA's hacking tools for the entire world to use.
1022740	1026820	Today, experts have reached a concerning consensus.
1026820	1032780	The capability for catastrophic cyberwarfare exists more acutely now than at any point
1032780	1039420	before—changing the very landscape for current and future conflicts.
1039420	1043060	Traditional weapons have consequences for the aggressors.
1043060	1047140	If Russia were to deploy a nuclear weapon, mutually assured destruction would dictate
1047140	1050020	a swift response by the target nation.
1050020	1052140	Cyberweapons are different.
1052140	1056660	It took years for major media organizations to start pointing towards the US and Israel
1056660	1060800	as the forces behind Stuxnet, and much of the proof came from tacit acknowledgement
1060800	1064180	by the American and Israeli government officials themselves.
1064180	1068460	When the stakes get raised, so will the secrecy.
1068460	1072420	Cyberwarfare has the potential for destruction without consequences.
1072420	1077980	In this new battlefield, there are no rules of engagement, there are no Geneva Conventions,
1077980	1082540	there are simply cutting edge aggressors and vulnerable targets who have not yet realized
1082540	1085300	the doors they've left open.
1085300	1089020	Experts believe that today represents a waiting period.
1089020	1093300	The weapons exist, they've been developed, and they could even be out there already,
1093300	1097580	embedded in the world's machines, laying dormant until the time comes for them to unleash
1097580	1099340	their destructive potential.
1099340	1103860	But by and large, that time has not yet come.
1103860	1108020	Faced with the reality that each individual weapon can only be used once until vulnerabilities
1108020	1112620	are patched, the nation-states and organizations behind these have yet to find the will to
1112620	1117640	unleash a truly devastating attack on a major nation—an attack that will wake the world
1117640	1122140	up to the truly existential nature of this new battlefield.
1122140	1124440	But that time is coming.
1124440	1126620	The big ones coming.
1126620	1130880	Doctors will no longer be fought in far-off lands that can be ignored simply by turning
1130880	1137180	off the TV—they will be fought in the technology that has come to envelop every moment of modern
1137180	1139380	life.
1139380	1143180	The US and Iran have had an incredibly tense relationship for the better part of the last
1143180	1147420	century in the context of what led to Iran's nuclear program, and therefore what led to
1147420	1151940	the US's development and deployment of Stuxnet stretches back into the 1950s.
1151940	1156160	If you want to learn about that other side of this topic, I'd highly recommend you
1156200	1161640	watch RealLifeLore's Modern Conflicts episode about US-Iranian relations on Nebula—that's
1161640	1166020	exclusive to Nebula since YouTube content guidelines make it tricky to cover conflicts.
1166020	1169320	This is just one of a huge number of exclusive videos on Nebula.
1169320	1172880	If you're the type of person that endlessly scrolls through streaming platforms struggling
1172880	1176760	to find something you want to watch, then Nebula is for you, because it's more stuff
1176760	1179440	by the creators you already watch and love.
1179440	1183080	After the Modern Conflicts episode, you can watch our feature-length doc on the crisis
1183080	1187280	and conflict brewing in the American West with the drying up of the Colorado River,
1187280	1190720	then watch Half as Interesting's travel-based game show where I'm chased across the country
1190720	1194800	trying to break weird laws along the way, then watch Real Engineering's spectacularly
1194800	1198720	produced series on the Battle of Britain, then watch Tom Scott's ingeniously designed
1198720	1203120	game show Money featuring a much younger me, and I could keep going, but that's probably
1203120	1206040	already a week's worth of content so you get the point.
1206040	1210040	Amazingly, the cheapest way to get access to Nebula gets you access to a whole other
1210040	1212760	streaming site, too—CuriosityStream.
1212760	1216920	Here you can watch a huge catalog of non-fiction shows and documentaries, including The King
1216920	1221560	of the Cruise—a captivating, quirky documentary about a Scottish baron who essentially lives
1221560	1226200	on cruise ships, seeking attention while telling fantastical stories to other cruisers.
