1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,440
The world's new era of warfare started here, on the eighth floor of an innocuous office

2
00:00:06,440 --> 00:00:09,400
building in Minsk, Belarus.

3
00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:15,360
A small anti-virus developer based within these walls, Virus Blockada, received an inbound

4
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:16,740
help request.

5
00:00:16,740 --> 00:00:22,120
Their client in Iran was experiencing random, repeated reboots of their industrial-control

6
00:00:22,120 --> 00:00:23,120
computers.

7
00:00:23,120 --> 00:00:28,040
It was probably a bug, they thought—a misconfiguration of Windows, or an issue of two programs not

8
00:00:28,040 --> 00:00:29,760
playing nice with each other.

9
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:34,220
So, they reinstalled Windows, but the issue remained.

10
00:00:34,220 --> 00:00:35,600
This upped the stakes.

11
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:40,360
This wasn't some mistake in Windows programming—this was something purposefully malicious.

12
00:00:40,360 --> 00:00:46,200
Soon, Sergei Ulasin, the company's researcher, found some suspicious files on the errant

13
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:47,320
machine.

14
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:51,640
As he combed through their code, he made a discovery—a discovery that shook the world

15
00:00:51,640 --> 00:00:55,400
of information security to its core.

16
00:00:55,400 --> 00:01:00,480
This code, when placed on a USB drive and plugged into a computer, could silently launch

17
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:04,340
and execute a program simply by being viewed.

18
00:01:04,340 --> 00:01:09,280
This was a brand new exploit—a catastrophically capable exploit.

19
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:14,420
All it took was one drive, simply plugged in, to infect one computer.

20
00:01:14,420 --> 00:01:19,240
This method of spread was mortifyingly efficient—it was something out of a movie.

21
00:01:19,240 --> 00:01:23,720
Recognizing that, the intuitive question was how far it had spread.

22
00:01:23,720 --> 00:01:25,720
The answer was chilling.

23
00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:26,720
58%.

24
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:32,600
58% of devices in Iran were infected with this malicious code.

25
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:37,880
58% of the country's computers were within the grips of some mystery developer so capable

26
00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:41,960
that they had identified an exploit of existential proportions.

27
00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:46,140
And what made this ominous development all that much more intimidating was that nobody

28
00:01:46,140 --> 00:01:49,740
knew what this code was intended to do.

29
00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:55,940
Nobody knew why a high-skilled hacker had spread a groundbreaking worm to 58% of Iran's

30
00:01:55,940 --> 00:01:56,940
computers.

31
00:01:56,940 --> 00:02:01,540
What became clear far quicker is that Virus Blocka does discovery did not gain prominence

32
00:02:01,540 --> 00:02:06,540
for the virus itself—it gained prominence because this small Belarusian antivirus company

33
00:02:06,540 --> 00:02:10,640
had discovered that the world had entered a new era.

34
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:18,520
The world had entered the era of highly advanced, highly targeted, and highly capable cyber-warfare.

35
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:24,140
This new era was made possible, and perhaps more importantly, made profitable by one single

36
00:02:24,140 --> 00:02:27,060
concept—the Zero Day.

37
00:02:27,060 --> 00:02:32,060
You see, in decades past, national intelligence agencies and nefarious independent operatives

38
00:02:32,060 --> 00:02:35,280
focused on gathering information in transit.

39
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:38,540
Rather than sneaking into the embassy, you intercepted the courier.

40
00:02:38,540 --> 00:02:41,900
Rather than placing a bug in the phone, you tapped the transmission line.

41
00:02:41,900 --> 00:02:46,840
It was simply easier to capture information on the move than at its origin or destination.

42
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:51,940
As the digital age awoke, this MO continued, but then the manufacturers caught up.

43
00:02:51,940 --> 00:02:57,640
Apple, Microsoft, Google, and others all started encrypting data as soon as it left devices.

44
00:02:57,640 --> 00:03:03,320
Shielding information behind complex mathematical systems, encryption, by this time, was, for

45
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:06,020
all practical purposes, perfect.

46
00:03:06,020 --> 00:03:10,280
Therefore, the strategies behind digital espionage had to change.

47
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:13,040
The snoops needed a new way to get in.

48
00:03:13,140 --> 00:03:17,180
While the math behind encryption may be infallible, people are not.

49
00:03:17,180 --> 00:03:21,980
The devices on which data is created and stored—phones, computers, servers, and more—are created

50
00:03:21,980 --> 00:03:22,980
by people.

51
00:03:22,980 --> 00:03:25,860
Therefore, the devices have holes.

52
00:03:25,860 --> 00:03:29,440
These holes are referred to as Zero Days.

53
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:31,780
Any software has vulnerabilities.

54
00:03:31,780 --> 00:03:35,140
Most will be caught before release, some will be caught shortly after and quickly addressed

55
00:03:35,140 --> 00:03:40,560
with a patch, but a tiny minority will go unnoticed for weeks, months, or years.

56
00:03:40,580 --> 00:03:45,140
In the early 2000s, hobbyist hackers spent their evenings scrolling through code, looking

57
00:03:45,140 --> 00:03:46,700
for these bugs.

58
00:03:46,700 --> 00:03:50,020
Faced with hostility and legal threats when reporting vulnerabilities straight to its

59
00:03:50,020 --> 00:03:54,460
software's developers, many would post about their findings on online forums—earning

60
00:03:54,460 --> 00:03:56,520
little else than bragging rights.

61
00:03:56,520 --> 00:04:00,240
Early information security companies would repackage this information and include it

62
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:05,160
in a digital threat alert system for companies and agencies—notifying them when their software

63
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:08,100
might have holes not yet fixed by the developer.

64
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:14,200
One such company, iDefense, found itself faltering in 2002 as they were selling the same information

65
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:19,960
at the same time to the same customer base—they simply had zero competitive advantage.

66
00:04:19,960 --> 00:04:22,000
So, they created one.

67
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,920
They decided to start paying for exploits.

68
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:28,560
Hackers would come to them with a bug, and, in exchange for their silence, iDefense would

69
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:32,480
pay anywhere between a couple hundred and a couple thousand dollars.

70
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:36,520
iDefense would then alert their software's developer and its own customers before the

71
00:04:36,540 --> 00:04:39,260
competing information security companies could.

72
00:04:39,260 --> 00:04:43,360
With the information staying among more trusted hands, this also lowered the likelihood of

73
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:46,520
a vulnerability being used for nefarious reasons.

74
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:51,220
iDefense had created an ethical, profitable system that gave hackers a first opportunity

75
00:04:51,220 --> 00:04:57,600
to monetize their hobby, and so it was no surprise that it grew into a massive success.

76
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:04,080
In mere months, the company went from weeks behind on payroll to a pioneer in the industry.

77
00:05:04,140 --> 00:05:08,980
But then the calls started coming, and the area codes were local.

78
00:05:08,980 --> 00:05:14,180
The Chantilly, Virginia-based company was fielding inquiries from around the DC Beltway.

79
00:05:14,180 --> 00:05:17,140
Government contractors wanted to buy their exploits.

80
00:05:17,140 --> 00:05:22,380
For the zero days that iDefense had paid three or four figures for, the callers were willing

81
00:05:22,380 --> 00:05:27,780
to pay six—as long as the company stayed quiet, as long as the buyer stayed the only

82
00:05:27,780 --> 00:05:30,220
one with knowledge of the zero day.

83
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:36,160
iDefense said no, but they soon found themselves priced out of the very market they had created.

84
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:41,000
Whereas their payouts might fund a vacation, the black market bounties paid for sports

85
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:44,320
cars—they simply couldn't compete.

86
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:49,360
On the other side of the equation, the American military machine had recognized the astonishing

87
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:53,340
potential rising out of a single software susceptibility.

88
00:05:53,340 --> 00:05:58,600
Unperturbed by borders, rules of engagement, or mortality, cyberwarfare had the potential

89
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:04,260
to silently achieve America's strategic goals so long as they, and only they, knew

90
00:06:04,260 --> 00:06:06,700
about these zero days.

91
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:12,580
In the years since, the market has propagated into a staggering degree of scale and legitimacy.

92
00:06:12,580 --> 00:06:16,620
While a thriving black and gray market still exists, especially for sales to countries

93
00:06:16,620 --> 00:06:20,940
with concerning human rights records, Western players like the US source the zero day exploits

94
00:06:20,940 --> 00:06:25,460
upon which they build their cyberweapons from companies that hardly hide what they're

95
00:06:25,460 --> 00:06:26,460
doing.

96
00:06:26,460 --> 00:06:31,400
For this extreme example, zero day broker Zerodium publishes their price list.

97
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:35,400
For an exploit capable of running a piece of code on a device or network without user

98
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:39,720
interaction, remote code execution as it's known, the company is willing to pay up to

99
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:42,040
$10,000 on router software.

100
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:47,740
For the same capability, they'll pay up to $100,000 on WordPress, and up to a million

101
00:06:47,740 --> 00:06:49,440
dollars for Windows.

102
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:55,000
Zerodium is even offering a temporarily higher $400,000 bounty for a remote code execution

103
00:06:55,000 --> 00:07:00,400
zero day on Microsoft Outlook—possibly indicating that someone, somewhere desperately

104
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:04,360
needs that very exploit for a cyberweapon under development.

105
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:08,580
Remote code execution exploits are the holy grail of zero days.

106
00:07:08,580 --> 00:07:13,200
Properly used, they can allow virtually unfettered access to another's machine.

107
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:18,580
Of course, zero days become worthless essentially the instant they are discovered—nowadays,

108
00:07:18,580 --> 00:07:21,780
software developers will quickly patch the exploits upon notification.

109
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:26,480
Therefore, the fact that this malicious code, quickly dubbed Stuxnet, included a remote

110
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:31,000
code execution exploit that could have sold for hundreds of thousands of dollars, indicated

111
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:34,360
that it was designed to do something equally valuable.

112
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:41,000
However, it soon became clear that the .lnk exploit did not stand alone.

113
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:46,460
Layered on top of it was another remote code execution exploit.

114
00:07:46,460 --> 00:07:50,700
Stuxnet was designed to embed itself into the file that communicates metadata to printers

115
00:07:50,700 --> 00:07:56,000
on a local network, however, with this zero day, that file would end up on all the other

116
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:01,820
computers on that local network—silently and quickly spreading from a single machine

117
00:08:01,820 --> 00:08:06,320
to an entire office, university, factory, or other facility.

118
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:12,340
Then, to complete the spread, the code used two Escalation of Privilege zero days, each

119
00:08:12,340 --> 00:08:16,760
for different versions of the operating system, allowing it, when installed on a single user

120
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:20,900
account, to gain access to an entire machine.

121
00:08:20,900 --> 00:08:25,880
Four zero days, four exploits each worth life-changing amounts of money.

122
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:32,220
This was, in the most literal sense, an unprecedented scale of hacking device.

123
00:08:32,220 --> 00:08:37,820
Never before had a piece of code so expertly intertwined four unknown exploits.

124
00:08:37,820 --> 00:08:42,940
Whoever was behind this had exhausted enormous resources onto this single, one megabyte piece

125
00:08:42,940 --> 00:08:47,540
of code, but even as it was being combed through by Virus Blockita—even as it set

126
00:08:47,540 --> 00:08:52,520
the information security industry ablaze, even as it propagated from machine to machine

127
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:58,980
in Iran and beyond—the single most important question remained unanswered.

128
00:08:58,980 --> 00:09:03,060
What was Stuxnet designed to do?

129
00:09:03,060 --> 00:09:08,060
This is the Natanz nuclear facility, and while neither Iranian officials nor anyone in global

130
00:09:08,060 --> 00:09:13,060
information security knew it, by the middle of 2010, the complex had become ground zero

131
00:09:13,060 --> 00:09:18,180
for the implementation of the most advanced cyberweapon the world had ever seen.

132
00:09:18,180 --> 00:09:21,900
Hours away from Tehran by car, sitting on the border of the nation's central desert

133
00:09:21,900 --> 00:09:27,040
in the shadow of the carcass mountains, this uranium enrichment facility is purposefully

134
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:29,060
geographically isolated.

135
00:09:29,060 --> 00:09:34,260
Its geographic isolation, however, pales in comparison to its digital isolation.

136
00:09:34,260 --> 00:09:39,300
Natanz, in response to an earlier, more rudimentary cyberattack, wasn't even connected to the

137
00:09:39,300 --> 00:09:44,060
internet as Iran had air-gapped the facility to protect important and notoriously fickle

138
00:09:44,060 --> 00:09:46,220
centrifuges from outside meddling.

139
00:09:46,220 --> 00:09:50,540
For the outside to meddle, then, a worm had to be planted manually.

140
00:09:50,540 --> 00:09:56,920
At some point in 2009, an unknowing employee at the plant, a spy, or a mole plugged a contaminated

141
00:09:56,920 --> 00:10:00,820
USB stick into a PC running Microsoft Windows.

142
00:10:00,820 --> 00:10:04,780
Having the malware past the air-gap, however, only marked the beginning.

143
00:10:04,780 --> 00:10:10,820
First, using the .lnk zero-day, the worm jumped from USB to computer without detection.

144
00:10:10,820 --> 00:10:15,540
Then, using the printer zero-day vulnerability, the worm gained access to the facility's

145
00:10:15,540 --> 00:10:19,140
local network and spread across the entire enrichment plant.

146
00:10:19,140 --> 00:10:24,900
Undetected, and inside the Natanz network, the malicious code still held on to its payload—continuing

147
00:10:24,900 --> 00:10:28,700
its search for a very particular target, as it went.

148
00:10:28,700 --> 00:10:32,020
Conceptually, cyberweapons are rather straightforward.

149
00:10:32,020 --> 00:10:36,940
Like most of their physical counterparts, these weapons consist of two primary components—the

150
00:10:36,940 --> 00:10:38,780
carrier and the payload.

151
00:10:38,780 --> 00:10:43,660
In other words, no matter the level of complexity, every cyberweapon is comprised of code that

152
00:10:43,660 --> 00:10:48,380
gains it access into a computer or network, and code that informs what the weapon does

153
00:10:48,380 --> 00:10:49,760
once it's inside.

154
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:53,060
At this stage, the carrier had so far succeeded.

155
00:10:53,060 --> 00:10:57,180
Stuxnet had access to any and all things going on here, throughout the administrative and

156
00:10:57,180 --> 00:11:03,280
monitoring areas of the facility—effectively, the enrichment processes surrounding infrastructure.

157
00:11:03,280 --> 00:11:07,580
The code's payload and, by extension, the malware's authors, however, weren't interested

158
00:11:07,580 --> 00:11:12,300
in crashing the plant's communications network or delivering a one-off denial of service.

159
00:11:12,300 --> 00:11:17,020
Instead, they worked towards something more tangible and long-lasting.

160
00:11:17,020 --> 00:11:23,140
What the code wanted access to was buried underground here, where actual, physical centrifuges

161
00:11:23,140 --> 00:11:29,340
were using centrifugal force to tear away unwanted isotopes and create Uranium-235.

162
00:11:29,340 --> 00:11:35,580
Running these centrifuges, though, weren't PCs, but programmable logic controllers—industrial

163
00:11:35,580 --> 00:11:39,260
control equipment that provided yet another hurdle for the malware.

164
00:11:39,260 --> 00:11:43,580
Finally, using stolen security certificates than zero-day vulnerabilities identified in

165
00:11:43,580 --> 00:11:49,200
Siemens Software, a German manufacturer whose PLCs controlled 164 of the Iranian centrifuges

166
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:55,640
each, the carrier had reached its target, completed its mission, and released its payload.

167
00:11:55,640 --> 00:12:00,600
Among the many genius and frightening potentials highlighted by this nefarious code, one troubling

168
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:05,180
aspect lies not in what it did, but what it intended not to do.

169
00:12:05,180 --> 00:12:10,020
For days after gaining access to the PLCs controlling the Iranian centrifuges, the very

170
00:12:10,020 --> 00:12:15,920
core of the nation's nuclear program, the payload did nothing but monitor the machine's

171
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:16,920
RPMs.

172
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:22,760
Then, after nearly two weeks, the code would briefly speed the centrifuges up to 1400 Hz—well

173
00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:26,780
beyond their normal operating range of between 800 and 1100.

174
00:12:26,780 --> 00:12:30,920
Weeks after that, the code would momentarily slow them down to 2 Hz, leading to increased

175
00:12:30,920 --> 00:12:33,680
wear and tear, and thus failure.

176
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:38,000
All the while, as the machines self-destructed at a slightly above average rate, the worm

177
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:42,200
reported to monitors that the centrifuges were running at average RPMs—that there

178
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:44,440
was nothing here to see.

179
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:49,200
Essentially, had it not managed to unintentionally escape from the facility, Stuxnet could have

180
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:54,360
potentially continued to cripple Iran's nuclear ambitions from within for years, perhaps

181
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:56,880
even decades, before detection.

182
00:12:56,880 --> 00:13:02,880
Therefore, prior to June of 2010, the piece of code was simultaneously invisible and physically

183
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:08,160
destructive—a cyberweapon experts couldn't identify, but one that was destroying hundreds

184
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:12,680
upon hundreds of strategically invaluable Iranian centrifuges.

185
00:13:12,680 --> 00:13:17,520
It's been more than a decade since Stuxnet was first identified.

186
00:13:17,520 --> 00:13:23,100
Still, no one has officially claimed responsibility for this first-of-a-kind weapon.

187
00:13:23,100 --> 00:13:27,580
The code's scale, though—its sheer size and complexity—has created a consensus that

188
00:13:27,580 --> 00:13:29,920
this couldn't be the work of one person.

189
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:33,480
While the world's most powerful hackers are likely to get their hands on a single

190
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:37,800
zero day, Stuxnet employed a staggering four.

191
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:42,400
Nor could this be the work of a group of activists, or even a minor nation-state, either.

192
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:47,960
At a megabyte, Stuxnet was orders of magnitude larger than any malware discovered before

193
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:48,960
it.

194
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:53,520
And it wasn't just massive, either—it was incredibly precise, laying dormant in

195
00:13:53,520 --> 00:13:58,040
computers across the globe and only weaponizing its devious payload when connecting to Siemens

196
00:13:58,040 --> 00:14:04,000
Step 7 software linked to a PLC running exactly 164 centrifuges.

197
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:08,440
Such size signaled that this was a weapon designed across years, while such clinical

198
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:13,040
precision signaled the code was crafted with potential future lawsuits in mind.

199
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:18,820
In short, just in the worm's design, experts the world over concluded it had to be crafted

200
00:14:18,820 --> 00:14:23,660
by a major world power, or multiple, with the time and resources to approach such an

201
00:14:23,660 --> 00:14:28,880
unprecedented undertaking, and it had to be a world power, or multiple, that wasn't

202
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:31,400
so friendly with Iran.

203
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:35,680
Information in the actual code and geopolitical context aren't our only clues as to who

204
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:37,540
is behind this, though.

205
00:14:37,540 --> 00:14:41,940
The experts have conducted countless interviews on background and pored over troves of leaked

206
00:14:41,940 --> 00:14:44,540
documents since the worm appeared.

207
00:14:44,540 --> 00:14:48,980
What they found was that the development of Stuxnet was described as a third option, that

208
00:14:48,980 --> 00:14:52,900
existed somewhere between doing nothing to slow Iran's nuclear advance and launching

209
00:14:52,900 --> 00:14:56,080
airstrikes to destroy the enrichment facilities.

210
00:14:56,080 --> 00:15:00,860
As an alternative was how the weapon was first presented to President Bush, then to Israeli

211
00:15:00,860 --> 00:15:06,980
officials, then eventually to President Obama—all of whom supported its implementation.

212
00:15:06,980 --> 00:15:11,300
What the journalists revealed was that the US and Israel had ushered the world into a

213
00:15:11,300 --> 00:15:16,780
new era of state-led cyberoffensive that wreaked physical destruction.

214
00:15:16,780 --> 00:15:21,020
Before this point, nation-states—the US through the NSA and Israel through its unit

215
00:15:21,020 --> 00:15:25,340
8200—used cyberdivisions to defend and surveil.

216
00:15:25,340 --> 00:15:28,420
Now they were going on the offensive.

217
00:15:28,420 --> 00:15:33,440
By crossing the Rubicon, though, and getting caught, the actions of the US and Israel have

218
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:35,860
opened Pandora's box.

219
00:15:35,860 --> 00:15:42,220
Though Iran denied involvement, in 2013, major American banks were hit with a concerted attack.

220
00:15:42,220 --> 00:15:47,040
American intelligence identified it as retaliation by Iranian, and a worrying lesson as to how

221
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:50,620
quickly the rival's cyber capabilities were expanding.

222
00:15:50,620 --> 00:15:56,060
Holding up American banks in 2013, however, only marked the beginning.

223
00:15:56,060 --> 00:16:01,740
Once the US unleashed Duxnet, other nation-states have worked to close the cyberweapon gap—many

224
00:16:01,740 --> 00:16:05,860
of which the US has, at best, a tenuous relationship with.

225
00:16:05,860 --> 00:16:10,220
North Korea, largely through its state-backed hack organization the Lazarus Group, was able

226
00:16:10,220 --> 00:16:15,980
to infiltrate Sony Pictures in 2014, then in 2017, the country's WannaCry ransomware

227
00:16:15,980 --> 00:16:20,500
forced the UK's National Health Service to work off pen and paper.

228
00:16:20,500 --> 00:16:25,260
Every year, China's cyberwarfare division grows stronger from the talent-scouted and

229
00:16:25,260 --> 00:16:30,420
zero-days identified at the Tianfu Cup, where competitive hackers tear into Google, Microsoft,

230
00:16:30,420 --> 00:16:31,700
and Apple software.

231
00:16:31,700 --> 00:16:37,400
In 2017, Russian cyberattacks brought Ukrainian banks, utilities, and government agencies

232
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:38,580
to their knees.

233
00:16:38,580 --> 00:16:43,820
In 2021, ransomware software locked up the US's colonial pipeline.

234
00:16:43,820 --> 00:16:47,460
Increasing the speed at which the rest of the world catches up to the US is the fact

235
00:16:47,460 --> 00:16:49,780
that American weapons are spreading.

236
00:16:49,780 --> 00:16:54,420
The United States has long been considered a leader, if not the leader, in cyberwarfare,

237
00:16:54,420 --> 00:16:59,180
but a 2017 leak by a hacker group known as the Shadow Brokers unleashed the American

238
00:16:59,180 --> 00:17:02,740
NSA's hacking tools for the entire world to use.

239
00:17:02,740 --> 00:17:06,820
Today, experts have reached a concerning consensus.

240
00:17:06,820 --> 00:17:12,780
The capability for catastrophic cyberwarfare exists more acutely now than at any point

241
00:17:12,780 --> 00:17:19,420
before—changing the very landscape for current and future conflicts.

242
00:17:19,420 --> 00:17:23,060
Traditional weapons have consequences for the aggressors.

243
00:17:23,060 --> 00:17:27,140
If Russia were to deploy a nuclear weapon, mutually assured destruction would dictate

244
00:17:27,140 --> 00:17:30,020
a swift response by the target nation.

245
00:17:30,020 --> 00:17:32,140
Cyberweapons are different.

246
00:17:32,140 --> 00:17:36,660
It took years for major media organizations to start pointing towards the US and Israel

247
00:17:36,660 --> 00:17:40,800
as the forces behind Stuxnet, and much of the proof came from tacit acknowledgement

248
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:44,180
by the American and Israeli government officials themselves.

249
00:17:44,180 --> 00:17:48,460
When the stakes get raised, so will the secrecy.

250
00:17:48,460 --> 00:17:52,420
Cyberwarfare has the potential for destruction without consequences.

251
00:17:52,420 --> 00:17:57,980
In this new battlefield, there are no rules of engagement, there are no Geneva Conventions,

252
00:17:57,980 --> 00:18:02,540
there are simply cutting edge aggressors and vulnerable targets who have not yet realized

253
00:18:02,540 --> 00:18:05,300
the doors they've left open.

254
00:18:05,300 --> 00:18:09,020
Experts believe that today represents a waiting period.

255
00:18:09,020 --> 00:18:13,300
The weapons exist, they've been developed, and they could even be out there already,

256
00:18:13,300 --> 00:18:17,580
embedded in the world's machines, laying dormant until the time comes for them to unleash

257
00:18:17,580 --> 00:18:19,340
their destructive potential.

258
00:18:19,340 --> 00:18:23,860
But by and large, that time has not yet come.

259
00:18:23,860 --> 00:18:28,020
Faced with the reality that each individual weapon can only be used once until vulnerabilities

260
00:18:28,020 --> 00:18:32,620
are patched, the nation-states and organizations behind these have yet to find the will to

261
00:18:32,620 --> 00:18:37,640
unleash a truly devastating attack on a major nation—an attack that will wake the world

262
00:18:37,640 --> 00:18:42,140
up to the truly existential nature of this new battlefield.

263
00:18:42,140 --> 00:18:44,440
But that time is coming.

264
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:46,620
The big ones coming.

265
00:18:46,620 --> 00:18:50,880
Doctors will no longer be fought in far-off lands that can be ignored simply by turning

266
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:57,180
off the TV—they will be fought in the technology that has come to envelop every moment of modern

267
00:18:57,180 --> 00:18:59,380
life.

268
00:18:59,380 --> 00:19:03,180
The US and Iran have had an incredibly tense relationship for the better part of the last

269
00:19:03,180 --> 00:19:07,420
century in the context of what led to Iran's nuclear program, and therefore what led to

270
00:19:07,420 --> 00:19:11,940
the US's development and deployment of Stuxnet stretches back into the 1950s.

271
00:19:11,940 --> 00:19:16,160
If you want to learn about that other side of this topic, I'd highly recommend you

272
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:21,640
watch RealLifeLore's Modern Conflicts episode about US-Iranian relations on Nebula—that's

273
00:19:21,640 --> 00:19:26,020
exclusive to Nebula since YouTube content guidelines make it tricky to cover conflicts.

274
00:19:26,020 --> 00:19:29,320
This is just one of a huge number of exclusive videos on Nebula.

275
00:19:29,320 --> 00:19:32,880
If you're the type of person that endlessly scrolls through streaming platforms struggling

276
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:36,760
to find something you want to watch, then Nebula is for you, because it's more stuff

277
00:19:36,760 --> 00:19:39,440
by the creators you already watch and love.

278
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:43,080
After the Modern Conflicts episode, you can watch our feature-length doc on the crisis

279
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:47,280
and conflict brewing in the American West with the drying up of the Colorado River,

280
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:50,720
then watch Half as Interesting's travel-based game show where I'm chased across the country

281
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:54,800
trying to break weird laws along the way, then watch Real Engineering's spectacularly

282
00:19:54,800 --> 00:19:58,720
produced series on the Battle of Britain, then watch Tom Scott's ingeniously designed

283
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:03,120
game show Money featuring a much younger me, and I could keep going, but that's probably

284
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:06,040
already a week's worth of content so you get the point.

285
00:20:06,040 --> 00:20:10,040
Amazingly, the cheapest way to get access to Nebula gets you access to a whole other

286
00:20:10,040 --> 00:20:12,760
streaming site, too—CuriosityStream.

287
00:20:12,760 --> 00:20:16,920
Here you can watch a huge catalog of non-fiction shows and documentaries, including The King

288
00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:21,560
of the Cruise—a captivating, quirky documentary about a Scottish baron who essentially lives

289
00:20:21,560 --> 00:20:26,200
on cruise ships, seeking attention while telling fantastical stories to other cruisers.
