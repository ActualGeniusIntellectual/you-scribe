4
00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:16,000
So you want to go to space, and you're not a billionaire.

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:23,120
You find yourself in a rather common situation—humanity has entered a futuristic era where commercial,

6
00:00:23,120 --> 00:00:26,580
civilian rocket launches are getting boring.

7
00:00:26,580 --> 00:00:32,500
In September 2021, a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket lifted off from Kennedy Space Center's Pad

8
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:38,380
39A, carrying four civilian crew members, and it was hardly a front-page story.

9
00:00:38,380 --> 00:00:43,900
These occurrences are getting commonplace, and the commonplace is not news.

10
00:00:43,900 --> 00:00:49,820
Precisely this, however, represents massive progress for humanity's access to what's

11
00:00:49,820 --> 00:00:50,820
beyond.

12
00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:57,220
For the first time in history, leaving Earth is as simple as signing a check, but, right

13
00:00:57,220 --> 00:01:02,160
now, few have the ability to sign these checks.

14
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:07,880
Current ticket prices for space tourism stretch well into the hundreds of thousands or millions,

15
00:01:07,880 --> 00:01:13,580
so assuming one needs a net worth of $50 million to afford that, there are only about 100,000

16
00:01:13,580 --> 00:01:17,460
people out there who have the ability to travel to space.

17
00:01:17,460 --> 00:01:23,180
SpaceX, Virgin Galactic, Blue Origin, and others insist that will change, though.

18
00:01:23,180 --> 00:01:28,180
They insist that, just as the civil aviation industry began as a novel luxury for the upper

19
00:01:28,180 --> 00:01:34,120
class, space tourism will steadily march towards a luxury for the masses.

20
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:36,660
Many are skeptical, though.

21
00:01:36,660 --> 00:01:41,140
Rockets are different animals than planes, and there might just be inherent constraints

22
00:01:41,140 --> 00:01:46,300
that prevent the kind of cost innovation that made hopping on a plane a chore, rather than

23
00:01:46,300 --> 00:01:47,540
an experience.

24
00:01:47,540 --> 00:01:52,020
So, how realistic is mass-market space tourism?

25
00:01:52,020 --> 00:01:57,140
Is there a reasonable possibility that within your lifetime, you will be able to leave Earth

26
00:01:57,140 --> 00:01:59,460
for an achievable price?

27
00:01:59,460 --> 00:02:04,380
Despite their differences, the closest analogy to the commercial space industry is still

28
00:02:04,380 --> 00:02:06,660
the commercial airline industry.

29
00:02:06,660 --> 00:02:12,140
Back when the Wright brothers started to experiment with flight, the pair had few commercial ambitions—they

30
00:02:12,140 --> 00:02:17,020
were simply infatuated by the prospect of controlled, powered flight.

31
00:02:17,020 --> 00:02:20,860
Once they achieved that, the brothers did find some commercial success with their new

32
00:02:20,860 --> 00:02:26,260
technology, but most uses of aircraft at the time were linked to their novelty, rather

33
00:02:26,260 --> 00:02:28,380
than any commercial purpose.

34
00:02:28,380 --> 00:02:33,460
The first wide-scale practical use of planes came in World War I, when militaries flew

35
00:02:33,460 --> 00:02:37,260
above battlefields to conduct reconnaissance on their enemies.

36
00:02:37,260 --> 00:02:42,300
This proved useful, so aircraft development and construction accelerated.

37
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:46,400
After the war, there were plenty of surplus planes, which early airlines were able to

38
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:48,740
acquire rather easily.

39
00:02:48,740 --> 00:02:54,040
Seeing its potential, governments incentivized aviation, such as in the US, where Congress

40
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:59,540
authorized a system of airmail contracts—airlines would get paid to carry mail, so airlines

41
00:02:59,540 --> 00:03:01,380
started to develop as businesses.

42
00:03:01,380 --> 00:03:05,660
They found that they'd often have extra space beyond the mailbags, so more and more

43
00:03:05,660 --> 00:03:08,940
seats were offered up to paying passengers.

44
00:03:08,940 --> 00:03:13,000
Western Air Express, for example, started service between Salt Lake City and Los Angeles

45
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:20,260
in 1926, for which they charged, inflation-adjusted, $1,400 for the eight-hour flight.

46
00:03:20,260 --> 00:03:26,860
At these prices, though, few chose to fly, so in 1931, still 85% of airline revenue in

47
00:03:26,860 --> 00:03:30,260
the US originated from airmail contracts.

48
00:03:30,260 --> 00:03:35,640
World War II immobilized an already stagnating industry, but it did once again create a mass

49
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:38,840
massive, practical purpose for airplanes.

50
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:43,560
The few years of conflict spurred huge industry growth and innovation, including the invention

51
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:48,620
of the jet plane, so after the war, many of the new technologies permeated into civil

52
00:03:48,620 --> 00:03:54,540
aviation, and there was a vast catalog of pilots and aircraft available for airlines.

53
00:03:54,540 --> 00:03:59,080
The jet engine then killed the ocean liner industry, which meant airplanes quickly became

54
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:04,360
the primary method of long-distance passenger transport, which increased demand, which increased

55
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:08,120
industry innovation, which decreased prices.

56
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:12,040
Industry deregulation starting in the 70s meant that airlines could compete in a fully

57
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:16,800
commercial manner, which led to the development of the first low-cost airlines.

58
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:22,080
These pushed down prices industry-wide, and helped all airlines become a service for all.

59
00:04:22,080 --> 00:04:28,240
Today, on the same Salt Lake City to LA route that Western Air Express flew for $1,400,

60
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:31,480
airlines regularly sell tickets for $50.

61
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:37,860
If that same level of price innovation happened in the commercial space industry, the $450,000

62
00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:44,160
Virgin Galactic ticket of today would cost just $16,000—an approachable, once-in-a-lifetime

63
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:48,320
luxury for well-off, but not absurdly wealthy individuals.

64
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:54,080
So, can the process that the airline industry went through work for space?

65
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:57,120
Well, it's actually working already.

66
00:04:57,120 --> 00:05:01,400
In its era, transporting materials on the American Space Shuttle to low-Earth orbit

67
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:07,600
cost an estimated $7,700 per pound, or $16,900 per kilogram.

68
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:12,120
SpaceX's Falcon Heavy rocket currently has eight launch contracts with publicly available

69
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:16,900
pricing data, and excluding those that have other costs included in the top-line numbers,

70
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:21,120
the average price for these missions sits at $145 million.

71
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:28,200
Now, while most payloads are far smaller, the Falcon Heavy could, in theory, carry 141,000

72
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:37,280
pounds or 64 tons into low-Earth orbit, meaning its cost is roughly $1,028 per pound, or $2,261

73
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:38,280
per kilogram.

74
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:43,440
A nearly eight-fold reduction in price is impressive, and the trend is expected to continue

75
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:47,460
as the company's Starship launch system comes online, and industry competition heats

76
00:05:47,460 --> 00:05:49,480
up in the coming years.

77
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:54,360
SpaceX, along with many other commercial space launch companies, has achieved these cost

78
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:59,060
reductions largely through a focus on one factor—reusability.

79
00:05:59,060 --> 00:06:04,340
The previous generation of rockets, such as the Atlas V, were not reusable—essentially,

80
00:06:04,340 --> 00:06:09,200
every element of the rocket was built, launched, and never used again.

81
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:14,120
This understandably inflated costs, creating a perfect opportunity for commercial companies

82
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:19,680
to come in and develop reusable launch systems to dramatically undercut prices.

83
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:25,240
This wasn't to the extent of the cost innovation—SpaceX, in particular, achieved success with insourcing,

84
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:30,800
manufacturing optimization, and inherent private sector cost focus—but reusability did represent

85
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:36,080
the lowest-hanging fruit, and the first big leap in reducing the cost of reaching space.

86
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:38,400
So, what's next?

87
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:43,560
While there's certainly more work to be done, we do know that reusability alone will

88
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:47,900
not be what brings the cost of space tourism to an achievable level.

89
00:06:47,900 --> 00:06:53,400
For example, running rocket launch facilities is extraordinarily expensive.

90
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:56,720
While getting an accurate picture of costs is difficult, since most launch companies

91
00:06:56,720 --> 00:07:01,040
have no financial reporting requirements, we do know that when SpaceX started developing

92
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:06,080
its launch facility at Vandenberg Space Force Base in California, it estimated $40 to $60

93
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:12,180
million in initial costs, followed by $5 to $10 million in annual ongoing costs.

94
00:07:12,180 --> 00:07:17,860
Using the lower end of those estimates, that means the company has sunk some $85 million

95
00:07:17,860 --> 00:07:19,180
into the facility.

96
00:07:19,180 --> 00:07:24,580
During that time, they used it for 17 launches, representing a per-launch cost of at least

97
00:07:24,580 --> 00:07:26,420
$5 million.

98
00:07:26,420 --> 00:07:31,140
This is almost certainly a gross underestimation, but assuming it were true, that would mean

99
00:07:31,140 --> 00:07:35,480
that SpaceX CEO Elon Musk's claim that their upcoming Starship rocket will operate at a

100
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:40,900
cost of $2 million per launch is impossible without intense focus on the ground operations

101
00:07:40,900 --> 00:07:41,900
aspect.

102
00:07:41,900 --> 00:07:46,980
The problem is that right now, operating a launch facility is like running Heathrow Airport

103
00:07:46,980 --> 00:07:52,180
for just a couple flights a year—clearly an inefficient process.

104
00:07:52,180 --> 00:07:56,660
Of course, one fix for that is simple—launch more rockets.

105
00:07:56,660 --> 00:08:01,440
The majority of the cost of running a facility like Vandenberg is fixed—launching 100 rockets

106
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:06,040
a year would not cost 10 times more than launching 10 rockets a year, so by increasing the number

107
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:10,440
of launches, the company reduces the per-launch facility cost.

108
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:14,760
This is just one example, but the point is that across the board, much of the remaining

109
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:19,720
opportunity for cost innovation is not in technology, as was the case with reusable

110
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:21,840
rockets, but with process.

111
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:25,920
What the commercial space industry needs is scale.

112
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:28,200
It was no different with planes.

113
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:32,040
The miniscule size of the industry in the early years meant that operating a single

114
00:08:32,040 --> 00:08:35,720
plane was extraordinarily expensive.

115
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:39,440
Early airlines had to do essentially everything themselves.

116
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:43,480
When Pan Am was working to start clipper service to Hong Kong, for example, they lacked

117
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:47,560
an existing, necessary refueling point between Midway and Guam.

118
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:52,360
However, Juan Trippe, the airline's founder, discovered records of a little-known atoll

119
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:55,800
in exactly the right spot—Wake Island.

120
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:59,480
He then had to lobby the President to place the atoll under the control of the Navy, then

121
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:03,880
persuade the Navy to send a boat to survey Wake Island, then negotiate a lease from the

122
00:09:03,880 --> 00:09:04,880
Navy.

123
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:08,600
Next, the airline hired a freighter ship to bring materials and construction workers to

124
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:13,240
the atoll, where they built a landing area for the clippers, dock, narrow-gauge railway,

125
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:15,760
refueling facility, hotel, and more.

126
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:20,120
The airline had to do all of this just to run their twice-weekly service, simply because

127
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:22,960
they were the first airline to cross the vast Pacific.

128
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:28,280
There were simply no economies of scale, which is precisely why a ticket on this service

129
00:09:28,280 --> 00:09:34,980
from San Francisco to Hong Kong cost, inflation-adjusted, $33,000 round-trip.

130
00:09:34,980 --> 00:09:37,840
What happened next, though, was World War II.

131
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:41,940
The prominent role that aviation played in the conflict spurred the will for infrastructure

132
00:09:41,940 --> 00:09:47,120
to be built, for development to be conducted, and simply for more planes to be built.

133
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:50,320
Altogether, it pushed prices down.

134
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:55,560
This can happen in the commercial space industry, too, because economies of scale exist in every

135
00:09:55,560 --> 00:09:56,560
industry.

136
00:09:56,560 --> 00:10:01,760
The problem for them, though, is that space doesn't have a World War II.

137
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:07,640
So far, there hasn't been a massive external factor that rapidly scaled the industry.

138
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:13,720
So, it's a classic catch-22—the industry cannot scale without reduced costs, and it

139
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:17,000
cannot reduce costs without scale.

140
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:21,520
Every new industry faces this conundrum, and every large industry has resolved this conundrum,

141
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:25,600
but it might be tougher for the space launch industry than most.

142
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:30,640
In any case, there are essentially two ways to pass the scale hurdle—you wait for demand

143
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:35,360
to grow, or you gamble with scaling before the demand comes in order to reduce costs,

144
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:37,320
which should increase demand.

145
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:41,840
The problem with the former is that right now, there's not really much reason to go

146
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:42,920
to space.

147
00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:48,000
For everyone but government-employed astronauts, the reason to go to space is to go to space,

148
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:52,100
and once they're there, the only thing to do is to be in space.

149
00:10:52,100 --> 00:10:57,560
The number of people today who both can afford to and want to go to space is miniscule, and

150
00:10:57,560 --> 00:11:02,160
it's abundantly clear that tourism alone will not spur the kind of demand growth needed

151
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:06,560
to reduce costs enough to induce a rapid spiral effect of industry growth.

152
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:08,900
So, why don't they gamble?

153
00:11:08,900 --> 00:11:13,720
This is, in effect, how every startup surpasses the scale conundrum—they take on investment

154
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:18,780
or debt, scale up, reduce their costs, open to a larger market of consumers, and use the

155
00:11:18,780 --> 00:11:21,680
greater earnings to pay back their investors or creditors.

156
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:27,800
Now, to be clear, nearly every space launch company does this—SpaceX, Blue Origin, Virgin

157
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:30,240
Orbit, and Rocket Lab are each investor-driven.

158
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:35,360
It's impossible to surpass the rocket development process without investment, because the businesses

159
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:38,680
can't earn revenue until after the rockets are developed.

160
00:11:38,680 --> 00:11:44,200
However, no company has yet taken on the level of investment or debt needed to scale their

161
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:48,520
process beyond current demand in order to dramatically reduce costs.

162
00:11:48,520 --> 00:11:52,400
That's because the industry has a data problem.

163
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:57,280
Right now, there are just so few space launch customers that it's impossible to accurately

164
00:11:57,280 --> 00:11:59,880
model how the market works.

165
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:04,280
In most industries, companies have a good idea of their product's price elasticity

166
00:12:04,280 --> 00:12:05,280
of demand.

167
00:12:05,280 --> 00:12:10,160
That's a measure of the extent to which demand changes given a change in price.

168
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:15,760
For example, consumer fuel demand is very inelastic—when people need to drive, they

169
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:20,280
need to drive—so they'll pay for fuel no matter the price.

170
00:12:20,280 --> 00:12:25,640
One study found its price elasticity is negative .09, meaning if someone buys 10 gallons at

171
00:12:25,640 --> 00:12:31,760
a price of $3 per gallon, they'll still buy 9.75 gallons when the price rises to $4.

172
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:37,400
Meanwhile, the demand for a can of Coca-Cola is found to be very price elastic.

173
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:41,640
If someone buys 10 a month at $1, they'll only buy 4 a month if the price is raised

174
00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:44,640
by 25 cents—at least theoretically.

175
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:49,560
This data is crucially useful for businesses to determine whether an investment in reducing

176
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:54,240
costs is worth it—they can directly compare how much they'll have to spend versus how

177
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:56,860
much additional revenue it should bring in.

178
00:12:56,860 --> 00:13:01,160
This is exactly how businesses make these investment decisions.

179
00:13:01,160 --> 00:13:08,480
However, in 2020, SpaceX had just six different customers—NASA, the US Space Force, the

180
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:13,960
South Korean Army, the Argentinian Space Agency, Sirius XM, and the US's National Reconnaissance

181
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:15,320
Office.

182
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:20,080
With six customers and their 12 launches, there just isn't enough data to accurately

183
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:22,520
model price elasticity.

184
00:13:22,520 --> 00:13:27,180
SpaceX just doesn't know, for example, whether investing a billion dollars in reducing launch

185
00:13:27,180 --> 00:13:32,020
costs by $10 million would be worth it—they don't know if it would induce enough additional

186
00:13:32,020 --> 00:13:34,680
demand to compensate for the cost.

187
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:39,280
This is the big reason why the industry cannot invest in scaling dramatically—it would

188
00:13:39,280 --> 00:13:43,560
just be a crapshoot, which is far too risky for a commercial company.

189
00:13:43,560 --> 00:13:48,620
So, the industry is largely reduced to waiting for the first option—waiting for demand

190
00:13:48,620 --> 00:13:49,700
to come.

191
00:13:49,700 --> 00:13:52,720
The industry needs their World War II.

192
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:58,600
Now, of course, space-based warfare is rather unlikely and extremely undesirable, but there

193
00:13:58,600 --> 00:14:02,620
is potentially another way that demand for getting both materials and people to space

194
00:14:02,620 --> 00:14:07,680
could ramp up rapidly—space-based industry.

195
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:11,880
Space-based industry is, of course, a different environment than that of Earth.

196
00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:16,640
Therefore, it enables the manufacturing of materials that Earth cannot.

197
00:14:16,640 --> 00:14:21,520
For example, one of the nearest, most realistic possibilities for space-based manufacturing

198
00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:23,440
is in fiber optics.

199
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:28,000
These cables are incredibly efficient at moving huge quantities of data over long distances,

200
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:32,000
so they act as the backbone of the world's communications infrastructure.

201
00:14:32,040 --> 00:14:38,640
Therefore, the manufacturing of them has turned into a massive, extremely fast-growing industry.

202
00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:44,900
Now, ZBLAN is a type of fluoride glass that theoretically could make fiber optic cables

203
00:14:44,900 --> 00:14:49,520
orders of magnitude more efficient, but the problem is that when manufacturing these in

204
00:14:49,520 --> 00:14:54,640
Earth's gravity, tiny crystals and bubbles appear that restrict data transmission.

205
00:14:54,640 --> 00:15:01,020
However, in space, when manufactured in microgravity, the fiber is clear, meaning these hypothetical

206
00:15:01,020 --> 00:15:04,580
orders of magnitude efficiency gains are realized.

207
00:15:04,580 --> 00:15:10,380
In addition, ZBLAN fiber optics would be incredibly price-dense—a single kilogram of the material

208
00:15:10,380 --> 00:15:14,220
would sell for hundreds of thousands or millions of dollars.

209
00:15:14,220 --> 00:15:20,180
So, this is a near-term case of something that can be made in space, has demand on Earth,

210
00:15:20,180 --> 00:15:24,500
for which the transportation process would not be cost prohibitive.

211
00:15:24,500 --> 00:15:26,900
This is crucial.

212
00:15:26,900 --> 00:15:30,420
This is what could start the space gold rush.

213
00:15:30,420 --> 00:15:35,460
If there is an in-demand industry that can only be conducted in space, people and materials

214
00:15:35,460 --> 00:15:38,260
would need to get to and from space.

215
00:15:38,260 --> 00:15:41,880
That would scale the launch industry, which would lower launch costs, which would enable

216
00:15:41,880 --> 00:15:45,780
more industries in space, which would scale the launch industry, which would lower launch

217
00:15:45,780 --> 00:15:48,980
costs, and so on and so forth.

218
00:15:48,980 --> 00:15:52,420
So, what's the answer?

219
00:15:52,420 --> 00:15:56,740
When will you and I be able to travel to what's beyond?

220
00:15:56,740 --> 00:16:04,100
Well, as of yet, this natural cycle of scale and growth, this gold rush, has yet to begin.

221
00:16:04,100 --> 00:16:07,900
However, it seems that it could be near.

222
00:16:07,900 --> 00:16:14,040
So, the industry to watch is less that of space launches, and more that of space-based

223
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:15,680
industries.

224
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:20,980
On Earth, there has been reason to travel since the beginning of civilization—airplanes

225
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:26,820
as a technology came into existence as a replacement for other methods of travel.

226
00:16:26,820 --> 00:16:31,300
Rockets are enabling travel to a new place, to which there is currently little reason

227
00:16:31,300 --> 00:16:32,580
to travel.

228
00:16:32,580 --> 00:16:37,420
Therefore, industry will be what gives that crucial reason for travel.

229
00:16:37,420 --> 00:16:42,340
The airline industry never grew off of tourists, because few tourists could afford the fares

230
00:16:42,340 --> 00:16:44,100
in the early days.

231
00:16:44,100 --> 00:16:49,000
It grew off of companies and governments finding rational reasons to send people around the

232
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:52,400
world by plane, whether for war or business.

233
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:56,620
The tourists followed in increasing numbers based on the price reductions that others

234
00:16:56,620 --> 00:16:58,180
induced.

235
00:16:58,180 --> 00:17:00,120
Space will not be different.

236
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:05,720
At its deepest level, enabling low-cost access is not a technological problem—it's an

237
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:07,360
economic one.

238
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:09,560
So, follow the money.

239
00:17:09,560 --> 00:17:13,280
Once you start seeing products coming from space, that's when your ticket to what's

240
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:18,060
beyond will start to become cheap.

241
00:17:18,060 --> 00:17:22,480
One industry that's yet to see much cost disruption is that of delivery food.

242
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:26,540
With all those fees added on by the apps, it's quite expensive to have food delivered

243
00:17:26,540 --> 00:17:27,760
to your door.

244
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:30,340
Many still do, though, since it's convenient.

245
00:17:30,340 --> 00:17:36,100
I certainly did, until I realized how poor it was for my health, my wallet, and the environment.

246
00:17:36,100 --> 00:17:38,460
Therefore, I switched to HelloFresh.

247
00:17:38,460 --> 00:17:42,780
Now I pick out all the meals I want, and the following week, a box arrives on my doorstep

248
00:17:42,780 --> 00:17:45,180
with all the ingredients and recipes.

249
00:17:45,180 --> 00:17:49,100
For example, this week I made the meatballs with bulgogi sauce, which were rather quick

250
00:17:49,100 --> 00:17:54,380
to make, since all the ingredients came in the exact right quantities, and also delicious.

251
00:17:54,380 --> 00:17:58,220
This is all completely true, by the way—I was using HelloFresh for almost a year before

252
00:17:58,220 --> 00:18:02,740
they sponsored a video, and I genuinely value the convenience of cutting out shopping, researching

253
00:18:02,740 --> 00:18:07,540
recipes, and long prep times, while still being able to make fresh, healthy, home-cooked

254
00:18:07,540 --> 00:18:08,540
meals.

255
00:18:08,540 --> 00:18:12,620
Also, University of Michigan research found that HelloFresh cuts down on food waste by

256
00:18:12,620 --> 00:18:17,380
25% compared to grocery shopping, since you get everything in the exact right quantities,

257
00:18:17,380 --> 00:18:22,780
and the box it all ships in is made almost entirely out of recyclable or recycled materials.

258
00:18:22,780 --> 00:18:26,740
I know HelloFresh is worth it since I've been using it for so long, but I'd encourage

259
00:18:26,740 --> 00:18:30,200
you to try it out as well to see if it fits into your lifestyle.

260
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:34,500
You can do so super easily, and help support Wendover, by clicking the button onscreen

261
00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:38,540
or heading to the link in the description, and using code WENDOVER14 to get up to 14

262
00:18:38,540 --> 00:18:42,580
free meals across your first five HelloFresh boxes, plus free shipping.
