00:12.120 --> 00:16.000
So you want to go to space, and you're not a billionaire.

00:16.000 --> 00:23.120
You find yourself in a rather common situation—humanity has entered a futuristic era where commercial,

00:23.120 --> 00:26.580
civilian rocket launches are getting boring.

00:26.580 --> 00:32.500
In September 2021, a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket lifted off from Kennedy Space Center's Pad

00:32.500 --> 00:38.380
39A, carrying four civilian crew members, and it was hardly a front-page story.

00:38.380 --> 00:43.900
These occurrences are getting commonplace, and the commonplace is not news.

00:43.900 --> 00:49.820
Precisely this, however, represents massive progress for humanity's access to what's

00:49.820 --> 00:50.820
beyond.

00:50.820 --> 00:57.220
For the first time in history, leaving Earth is as simple as signing a check, but, right

00:57.220 --> 01:02.160
now, few have the ability to sign these checks.

01:02.160 --> 01:07.880
Current ticket prices for space tourism stretch well into the hundreds of thousands or millions,

01:07.880 --> 01:13.580
so assuming one needs a net worth of $50 million to afford that, there are only about 100,000

01:13.580 --> 01:17.460
people out there who have the ability to travel to space.

01:17.460 --> 01:23.180
SpaceX, Virgin Galactic, Blue Origin, and others insist that will change, though.

01:23.180 --> 01:28.180
They insist that, just as the civil aviation industry began as a novel luxury for the upper

01:28.180 --> 01:34.120
class, space tourism will steadily march towards a luxury for the masses.

01:34.120 --> 01:36.660
Many are skeptical, though.

01:36.660 --> 01:41.140
Rockets are different animals than planes, and there might just be inherent constraints

01:41.140 --> 01:46.300
that prevent the kind of cost innovation that made hopping on a plane a chore, rather than

01:46.300 --> 01:47.540
an experience.

01:47.540 --> 01:52.020
So, how realistic is mass-market space tourism?

01:52.020 --> 01:57.140
Is there a reasonable possibility that within your lifetime, you will be able to leave Earth

01:57.140 --> 01:59.460
for an achievable price?

01:59.460 --> 02:04.380
Despite their differences, the closest analogy to the commercial space industry is still

02:04.380 --> 02:06.660
the commercial airline industry.

02:06.660 --> 02:12.140
Back when the Wright brothers started to experiment with flight, the pair had few commercial ambitions—they

02:12.140 --> 02:17.020
were simply infatuated by the prospect of controlled, powered flight.

02:17.020 --> 02:20.860
Once they achieved that, the brothers did find some commercial success with their new

02:20.860 --> 02:26.260
technology, but most uses of aircraft at the time were linked to their novelty, rather

02:26.260 --> 02:28.380
than any commercial purpose.

02:28.380 --> 02:33.460
The first wide-scale practical use of planes came in World War I, when militaries flew

02:33.460 --> 02:37.260
above battlefields to conduct reconnaissance on their enemies.

02:37.260 --> 02:42.300
This proved useful, so aircraft development and construction accelerated.

02:42.300 --> 02:46.400
After the war, there were plenty of surplus planes, which early airlines were able to

02:46.400 --> 02:48.740
acquire rather easily.

02:48.740 --> 02:54.040
Seeing its potential, governments incentivized aviation, such as in the US, where Congress

02:54.040 --> 02:59.540
authorized a system of airmail contracts—airlines would get paid to carry mail, so airlines

02:59.540 --> 03:01.380
started to develop as businesses.

03:01.380 --> 03:05.660
They found that they'd often have extra space beyond the mailbags, so more and more

03:05.660 --> 03:08.940
seats were offered up to paying passengers.

03:08.940 --> 03:13.000
Western Air Express, for example, started service between Salt Lake City and Los Angeles

03:13.000 --> 03:20.260
in 1926, for which they charged, inflation-adjusted, $1,400 for the eight-hour flight.

03:20.260 --> 03:26.860
At these prices, though, few chose to fly, so in 1931, still 85% of airline revenue in

03:26.860 --> 03:30.260
the US originated from airmail contracts.

03:30.260 --> 03:35.640
World War II immobilized an already stagnating industry, but it did once again create a mass

03:35.640 --> 03:38.840
massive, practical purpose for airplanes.

03:38.840 --> 03:43.560
The few years of conflict spurred huge industry growth and innovation, including the invention

03:43.560 --> 03:48.620
of the jet plane, so after the war, many of the new technologies permeated into civil

03:48.620 --> 03:54.540
aviation, and there was a vast catalog of pilots and aircraft available for airlines.

03:54.540 --> 03:59.080
The jet engine then killed the ocean liner industry, which meant airplanes quickly became

03:59.080 --> 04:04.360
the primary method of long-distance passenger transport, which increased demand, which increased

04:04.360 --> 04:08.120
industry innovation, which decreased prices.

04:08.120 --> 04:12.040
Industry deregulation starting in the 70s meant that airlines could compete in a fully

04:12.040 --> 04:16.800
commercial manner, which led to the development of the first low-cost airlines.

04:16.800 --> 04:22.080
These pushed down prices industry-wide, and helped all airlines become a service for all.

04:22.080 --> 04:28.240
Today, on the same Salt Lake City to LA route that Western Air Express flew for $1,400,

04:28.240 --> 04:31.480
airlines regularly sell tickets for $50.

04:31.480 --> 04:37.860
If that same level of price innovation happened in the commercial space industry, the $450,000

04:37.860 --> 04:44.160
Virgin Galactic ticket of today would cost just $16,000—an approachable, once-in-a-lifetime

04:44.160 --> 04:48.320
luxury for well-off, but not absurdly wealthy individuals.

04:48.320 --> 04:54.080
So, can the process that the airline industry went through work for space?

04:54.080 --> 04:57.120
Well, it's actually working already.

04:57.120 --> 05:01.400
In its era, transporting materials on the American Space Shuttle to low-Earth orbit

05:01.400 --> 05:07.600
cost an estimated $7,700 per pound, or $16,900 per kilogram.

05:07.600 --> 05:12.120
SpaceX's Falcon Heavy rocket currently has eight launch contracts with publicly available

05:12.120 --> 05:16.900
pricing data, and excluding those that have other costs included in the top-line numbers,

05:16.900 --> 05:21.120
the average price for these missions sits at $145 million.

05:21.120 --> 05:28.200
Now, while most payloads are far smaller, the Falcon Heavy could, in theory, carry 141,000

05:28.200 --> 05:37.280
pounds or 64 tons into low-Earth orbit, meaning its cost is roughly $1,028 per pound, or $2,261

05:37.280 --> 05:38.280
per kilogram.

05:38.280 --> 05:43.440
A nearly eight-fold reduction in price is impressive, and the trend is expected to continue

05:43.440 --> 05:47.460
as the company's Starship launch system comes online, and industry competition heats

05:47.460 --> 05:49.480
up in the coming years.

05:49.520 --> 05:54.360
SpaceX, along with many other commercial space launch companies, has achieved these cost

05:54.360 --> 05:59.060
reductions largely through a focus on one factor—reusability.

05:59.060 --> 06:04.340
The previous generation of rockets, such as the Atlas V, were not reusable—essentially,

06:04.340 --> 06:09.200
every element of the rocket was built, launched, and never used again.

06:09.200 --> 06:14.120
This understandably inflated costs, creating a perfect opportunity for commercial companies

06:14.120 --> 06:19.680
to come in and develop reusable launch systems to dramatically undercut prices.

06:19.680 --> 06:25.240
This wasn't to the extent of the cost innovation—SpaceX, in particular, achieved success with insourcing,

06:25.240 --> 06:30.800
manufacturing optimization, and inherent private sector cost focus—but reusability did represent

06:30.800 --> 06:36.080
the lowest-hanging fruit, and the first big leap in reducing the cost of reaching space.

06:36.080 --> 06:38.400
So, what's next?

06:38.400 --> 06:43.560
While there's certainly more work to be done, we do know that reusability alone will

06:43.560 --> 06:47.900
not be what brings the cost of space tourism to an achievable level.

06:47.900 --> 06:53.400
For example, running rocket launch facilities is extraordinarily expensive.

06:53.400 --> 06:56.720
While getting an accurate picture of costs is difficult, since most launch companies

06:56.720 --> 07:01.040
have no financial reporting requirements, we do know that when SpaceX started developing

07:01.040 --> 07:06.080
its launch facility at Vandenberg Space Force Base in California, it estimated $40 to $60

07:06.080 --> 07:12.180
million in initial costs, followed by $5 to $10 million in annual ongoing costs.

07:12.180 --> 07:17.860
Using the lower end of those estimates, that means the company has sunk some $85 million

07:17.860 --> 07:19.180
into the facility.

07:19.180 --> 07:24.580
During that time, they used it for 17 launches, representing a per-launch cost of at least

07:24.580 --> 07:26.420
$5 million.

07:26.420 --> 07:31.140
This is almost certainly a gross underestimation, but assuming it were true, that would mean

07:31.140 --> 07:35.480
that SpaceX CEO Elon Musk's claim that their upcoming Starship rocket will operate at a

07:35.480 --> 07:40.900
cost of $2 million per launch is impossible without intense focus on the ground operations

07:40.900 --> 07:41.900
aspect.

07:41.900 --> 07:46.980
The problem is that right now, operating a launch facility is like running Heathrow Airport

07:46.980 --> 07:52.180
for just a couple flights a year—clearly an inefficient process.

07:52.180 --> 07:56.660
Of course, one fix for that is simple—launch more rockets.

07:56.660 --> 08:01.440
The majority of the cost of running a facility like Vandenberg is fixed—launching 100 rockets

08:01.440 --> 08:06.040
a year would not cost 10 times more than launching 10 rockets a year, so by increasing the number

08:06.040 --> 08:10.440
of launches, the company reduces the per-launch facility cost.

08:10.440 --> 08:14.760
This is just one example, but the point is that across the board, much of the remaining

08:14.760 --> 08:19.720
opportunity for cost innovation is not in technology, as was the case with reusable

08:19.720 --> 08:21.840
rockets, but with process.

08:21.840 --> 08:25.920
What the commercial space industry needs is scale.

08:25.920 --> 08:28.200
It was no different with planes.

08:28.200 --> 08:32.040
The miniscule size of the industry in the early years meant that operating a single

08:32.040 --> 08:35.720
plane was extraordinarily expensive.

08:35.720 --> 08:39.440
Early airlines had to do essentially everything themselves.

08:39.440 --> 08:43.480
When Pan Am was working to start clipper service to Hong Kong, for example, they lacked

08:43.480 --> 08:47.560
an existing, necessary refueling point between Midway and Guam.

08:47.560 --> 08:52.360
However, Juan Trippe, the airline's founder, discovered records of a little-known atoll

08:52.360 --> 08:55.800
in exactly the right spot—Wake Island.

08:55.800 --> 08:59.480
He then had to lobby the President to place the atoll under the control of the Navy, then

08:59.480 --> 09:03.880
persuade the Navy to send a boat to survey Wake Island, then negotiate a lease from the

09:03.880 --> 09:04.880
Navy.

09:04.880 --> 09:08.600
Next, the airline hired a freighter ship to bring materials and construction workers to

09:08.600 --> 09:13.240
the atoll, where they built a landing area for the clippers, dock, narrow-gauge railway,

09:13.240 --> 09:15.760
refueling facility, hotel, and more.

09:15.760 --> 09:20.120
The airline had to do all of this just to run their twice-weekly service, simply because

09:20.120 --> 09:22.960
they were the first airline to cross the vast Pacific.

09:22.960 --> 09:28.280
There were simply no economies of scale, which is precisely why a ticket on this service

09:28.280 --> 09:34.980
from San Francisco to Hong Kong cost, inflation-adjusted, $33,000 round-trip.

09:34.980 --> 09:37.840
What happened next, though, was World War II.

09:37.840 --> 09:41.940
The prominent role that aviation played in the conflict spurred the will for infrastructure

09:41.940 --> 09:47.120
to be built, for development to be conducted, and simply for more planes to be built.

09:47.120 --> 09:50.320
Altogether, it pushed prices down.

09:50.320 --> 09:55.560
This can happen in the commercial space industry, too, because economies of scale exist in every

09:55.560 --> 09:56.560
industry.

09:56.560 --> 10:01.760
The problem for them, though, is that space doesn't have a World War II.

10:01.760 --> 10:07.640
So far, there hasn't been a massive external factor that rapidly scaled the industry.

10:07.640 --> 10:13.720
So, it's a classic catch-22—the industry cannot scale without reduced costs, and it

10:13.720 --> 10:17.000
cannot reduce costs without scale.

10:17.000 --> 10:21.520
Every new industry faces this conundrum, and every large industry has resolved this conundrum,

10:21.520 --> 10:25.600
but it might be tougher for the space launch industry than most.

10:25.600 --> 10:30.640
In any case, there are essentially two ways to pass the scale hurdle—you wait for demand

10:30.640 --> 10:35.360
to grow, or you gamble with scaling before the demand comes in order to reduce costs,

10:35.360 --> 10:37.320
which should increase demand.

10:37.320 --> 10:41.840
The problem with the former is that right now, there's not really much reason to go

10:41.840 --> 10:42.920
to space.

10:42.920 --> 10:48.000
For everyone but government-employed astronauts, the reason to go to space is to go to space,

10:48.000 --> 10:52.100
and once they're there, the only thing to do is to be in space.

10:52.100 --> 10:57.560
The number of people today who both can afford to and want to go to space is miniscule, and

10:57.560 --> 11:02.160
it's abundantly clear that tourism alone will not spur the kind of demand growth needed

11:02.160 --> 11:06.560
to reduce costs enough to induce a rapid spiral effect of industry growth.

11:06.560 --> 11:08.900
So, why don't they gamble?

11:08.900 --> 11:13.720
This is, in effect, how every startup surpasses the scale conundrum—they take on investment

11:13.720 --> 11:18.780
or debt, scale up, reduce their costs, open to a larger market of consumers, and use the

11:18.780 --> 11:21.680
greater earnings to pay back their investors or creditors.

11:21.680 --> 11:27.800
Now, to be clear, nearly every space launch company does this—SpaceX, Blue Origin, Virgin

11:27.800 --> 11:30.240
Orbit, and Rocket Lab are each investor-driven.

11:30.240 --> 11:35.360
It's impossible to surpass the rocket development process without investment, because the businesses

11:35.360 --> 11:38.680
can't earn revenue until after the rockets are developed.

11:38.680 --> 11:44.200
However, no company has yet taken on the level of investment or debt needed to scale their

11:44.200 --> 11:48.520
process beyond current demand in order to dramatically reduce costs.

11:48.520 --> 11:52.400
That's because the industry has a data problem.

11:52.400 --> 11:57.280
Right now, there are just so few space launch customers that it's impossible to accurately

11:57.280 --> 11:59.880
model how the market works.

11:59.880 --> 12:04.280
In most industries, companies have a good idea of their product's price elasticity

12:04.280 --> 12:05.280
of demand.

12:05.280 --> 12:10.160
That's a measure of the extent to which demand changes given a change in price.

12:10.160 --> 12:15.760
For example, consumer fuel demand is very inelastic—when people need to drive, they

12:15.760 --> 12:20.280
need to drive—so they'll pay for fuel no matter the price.

12:20.280 --> 12:25.640
One study found its price elasticity is negative .09, meaning if someone buys 10 gallons at

12:25.640 --> 12:31.760
a price of $3 per gallon, they'll still buy 9.75 gallons when the price rises to $4.

12:31.760 --> 12:37.400
Meanwhile, the demand for a can of Coca-Cola is found to be very price elastic.

12:37.400 --> 12:41.640
If someone buys 10 a month at $1, they'll only buy 4 a month if the price is raised

12:41.640 --> 12:44.640
by 25 cents—at least theoretically.

12:44.640 --> 12:49.560
This data is crucially useful for businesses to determine whether an investment in reducing

12:49.560 --> 12:54.240
costs is worth it—they can directly compare how much they'll have to spend versus how

12:54.240 --> 12:56.860
much additional revenue it should bring in.

12:56.860 --> 13:01.160
This is exactly how businesses make these investment decisions.

13:01.160 --> 13:08.480
However, in 2020, SpaceX had just six different customers—NASA, the US Space Force, the

13:08.480 --> 13:13.960
South Korean Army, the Argentinian Space Agency, Sirius XM, and the US's National Reconnaissance

13:13.960 --> 13:15.320
Office.

13:15.320 --> 13:20.080
With six customers and their 12 launches, there just isn't enough data to accurately

13:20.080 --> 13:22.520
model price elasticity.

13:22.520 --> 13:27.180
SpaceX just doesn't know, for example, whether investing a billion dollars in reducing launch

13:27.180 --> 13:32.020
costs by $10 million would be worth it—they don't know if it would induce enough additional

13:32.020 --> 13:34.680
demand to compensate for the cost.

13:34.680 --> 13:39.280
This is the big reason why the industry cannot invest in scaling dramatically—it would

13:39.280 --> 13:43.560
just be a crapshoot, which is far too risky for a commercial company.

13:43.560 --> 13:48.620
So, the industry is largely reduced to waiting for the first option—waiting for demand

13:48.620 --> 13:49.700
to come.

13:49.700 --> 13:52.720
The industry needs their World War II.

13:52.720 --> 13:58.600
Now, of course, space-based warfare is rather unlikely and extremely undesirable, but there

13:58.600 --> 14:02.620
is potentially another way that demand for getting both materials and people to space

14:02.620 --> 14:07.680
could ramp up rapidly—space-based industry.

14:07.720 --> 14:11.880
Space-based industry is, of course, a different environment than that of Earth.

14:11.880 --> 14:16.640
Therefore, it enables the manufacturing of materials that Earth cannot.

14:16.640 --> 14:21.520
For example, one of the nearest, most realistic possibilities for space-based manufacturing

14:21.520 --> 14:23.440
is in fiber optics.

14:23.440 --> 14:28.000
These cables are incredibly efficient at moving huge quantities of data over long distances,

14:28.000 --> 14:32.000
so they act as the backbone of the world's communications infrastructure.

14:32.040 --> 14:38.640
Therefore, the manufacturing of them has turned into a massive, extremely fast-growing industry.

14:38.640 --> 14:44.900
Now, ZBLAN is a type of fluoride glass that theoretically could make fiber optic cables

14:44.900 --> 14:49.520
orders of magnitude more efficient, but the problem is that when manufacturing these in

14:49.520 --> 14:54.640
Earth's gravity, tiny crystals and bubbles appear that restrict data transmission.

14:54.640 --> 15:01.020
However, in space, when manufactured in microgravity, the fiber is clear, meaning these hypothetical

15:01.020 --> 15:04.580
orders of magnitude efficiency gains are realized.

15:04.580 --> 15:10.380
In addition, ZBLAN fiber optics would be incredibly price-dense—a single kilogram of the material

15:10.380 --> 15:14.220
would sell for hundreds of thousands or millions of dollars.

15:14.220 --> 15:20.180
So, this is a near-term case of something that can be made in space, has demand on Earth,

15:20.180 --> 15:24.500
for which the transportation process would not be cost prohibitive.

15:24.500 --> 15:26.900
This is crucial.

15:26.900 --> 15:30.420
This is what could start the space gold rush.

15:30.420 --> 15:35.460
If there is an in-demand industry that can only be conducted in space, people and materials

15:35.460 --> 15:38.260
would need to get to and from space.

15:38.260 --> 15:41.880
That would scale the launch industry, which would lower launch costs, which would enable

15:41.880 --> 15:45.780
more industries in space, which would scale the launch industry, which would lower launch

15:45.780 --> 15:48.980
costs, and so on and so forth.

15:48.980 --> 15:52.420
So, what's the answer?

15:52.420 --> 15:56.740
When will you and I be able to travel to what's beyond?

15:56.740 --> 16:04.100
Well, as of yet, this natural cycle of scale and growth, this gold rush, has yet to begin.

16:04.100 --> 16:07.900
However, it seems that it could be near.

16:07.900 --> 16:14.040
So, the industry to watch is less that of space launches, and more that of space-based

16:14.040 --> 16:15.680
industries.

16:15.680 --> 16:20.980
On Earth, there has been reason to travel since the beginning of civilization—airplanes

16:20.980 --> 16:26.820
as a technology came into existence as a replacement for other methods of travel.

16:26.820 --> 16:31.300
Rockets are enabling travel to a new place, to which there is currently little reason

16:31.300 --> 16:32.580
to travel.

16:32.580 --> 16:37.420
Therefore, industry will be what gives that crucial reason for travel.

16:37.420 --> 16:42.340
The airline industry never grew off of tourists, because few tourists could afford the fares

16:42.340 --> 16:44.100
in the early days.

16:44.100 --> 16:49.000
It grew off of companies and governments finding rational reasons to send people around the

16:49.000 --> 16:52.400
world by plane, whether for war or business.

16:52.400 --> 16:56.620
The tourists followed in increasing numbers based on the price reductions that others

16:56.620 --> 16:58.180
induced.

16:58.180 --> 17:00.120
Space will not be different.

17:00.120 --> 17:05.720
At its deepest level, enabling low-cost access is not a technological problem—it's an

17:05.720 --> 17:07.360
economic one.

17:07.360 --> 17:09.560
So, follow the money.

17:09.560 --> 17:13.280
Once you start seeing products coming from space, that's when your ticket to what's

17:13.280 --> 17:18.060
beyond will start to become cheap.

17:18.060 --> 17:22.480
One industry that's yet to see much cost disruption is that of delivery food.

17:22.480 --> 17:26.540
With all those fees added on by the apps, it's quite expensive to have food delivered

17:26.540 --> 17:27.760
to your door.

17:27.760 --> 17:30.340
Many still do, though, since it's convenient.

17:30.340 --> 17:36.100
I certainly did, until I realized how poor it was for my health, my wallet, and the environment.

17:36.100 --> 17:38.460
Therefore, I switched to HelloFresh.

17:38.460 --> 17:42.780
Now I pick out all the meals I want, and the following week, a box arrives on my doorstep

17:42.780 --> 17:45.180
with all the ingredients and recipes.

17:45.180 --> 17:49.100
For example, this week I made the meatballs with bulgogi sauce, which were rather quick

17:49.100 --> 17:54.380
to make, since all the ingredients came in the exact right quantities, and also delicious.

17:54.380 --> 17:58.220
This is all completely true, by the way—I was using HelloFresh for almost a year before

17:58.220 --> 18:02.740
they sponsored a video, and I genuinely value the convenience of cutting out shopping, researching

18:02.740 --> 18:07.540
recipes, and long prep times, while still being able to make fresh, healthy, home-cooked

18:07.540 --> 18:08.540
meals.

18:08.540 --> 18:12.620
Also, University of Michigan research found that HelloFresh cuts down on food waste by

18:12.620 --> 18:17.380
25% compared to grocery shopping, since you get everything in the exact right quantities,

18:17.380 --> 18:22.780
and the box it all ships in is made almost entirely out of recyclable or recycled materials.

18:22.780 --> 18:26.740
I know HelloFresh is worth it since I've been using it for so long, but I'd encourage

18:26.740 --> 18:30.200
you to try it out as well to see if it fits into your lifestyle.

18:30.200 --> 18:34.500
You can do so super easily, and help support Wendover, by clicking the button onscreen

18:34.500 --> 18:38.540
or heading to the link in the description, and using code WENDOVER14 to get up to 14

18:38.540 --> 18:42.580
free meals across your first five HelloFresh boxes, plus free shipping.
