12120	16000	So you want to go to space, and you're not a billionaire.
16000	23120	You find yourself in a rather common situation—humanity has entered a futuristic era where commercial,
23120	26580	civilian rocket launches are getting boring.
26580	32500	In September 2021, a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket lifted off from Kennedy Space Center's Pad
32500	38380	39A, carrying four civilian crew members, and it was hardly a front-page story.
38380	43900	These occurrences are getting commonplace, and the commonplace is not news.
43900	49820	Precisely this, however, represents massive progress for humanity's access to what's
49820	50820	beyond.
50820	57220	For the first time in history, leaving Earth is as simple as signing a check, but, right
57220	62160	now, few have the ability to sign these checks.
62160	67880	Current ticket prices for space tourism stretch well into the hundreds of thousands or millions,
67880	73580	so assuming one needs a net worth of $50 million to afford that, there are only about 100,000
73580	77460	people out there who have the ability to travel to space.
77460	83180	SpaceX, Virgin Galactic, Blue Origin, and others insist that will change, though.
83180	88180	They insist that, just as the civil aviation industry began as a novel luxury for the upper
88180	94120	class, space tourism will steadily march towards a luxury for the masses.
94120	96660	Many are skeptical, though.
96660	101140	Rockets are different animals than planes, and there might just be inherent constraints
101140	106300	that prevent the kind of cost innovation that made hopping on a plane a chore, rather than
106300	107540	an experience.
107540	112020	So, how realistic is mass-market space tourism?
112020	117140	Is there a reasonable possibility that within your lifetime, you will be able to leave Earth
117140	119460	for an achievable price?
119460	124380	Despite their differences, the closest analogy to the commercial space industry is still
124380	126660	the commercial airline industry.
126660	132140	Back when the Wright brothers started to experiment with flight, the pair had few commercial ambitions—they
132140	137020	were simply infatuated by the prospect of controlled, powered flight.
137020	140860	Once they achieved that, the brothers did find some commercial success with their new
140860	146260	technology, but most uses of aircraft at the time were linked to their novelty, rather
146260	148380	than any commercial purpose.
148380	153460	The first wide-scale practical use of planes came in World War I, when militaries flew
153460	157260	above battlefields to conduct reconnaissance on their enemies.
157260	162300	This proved useful, so aircraft development and construction accelerated.
162300	166400	After the war, there were plenty of surplus planes, which early airlines were able to
166400	168740	acquire rather easily.
168740	174040	Seeing its potential, governments incentivized aviation, such as in the US, where Congress
174040	179540	authorized a system of airmail contracts—airlines would get paid to carry mail, so airlines
179540	181380	started to develop as businesses.
181380	185660	They found that they'd often have extra space beyond the mailbags, so more and more
185660	188940	seats were offered up to paying passengers.
188940	193000	Western Air Express, for example, started service between Salt Lake City and Los Angeles
193000	200260	in 1926, for which they charged, inflation-adjusted, $1,400 for the eight-hour flight.
200260	206860	At these prices, though, few chose to fly, so in 1931, still 85% of airline revenue in
206860	210260	the US originated from airmail contracts.
210260	215640	World War II immobilized an already stagnating industry, but it did once again create a mass
215640	218840	massive, practical purpose for airplanes.
218840	223560	The few years of conflict spurred huge industry growth and innovation, including the invention
223560	228620	of the jet plane, so after the war, many of the new technologies permeated into civil
228620	234540	aviation, and there was a vast catalog of pilots and aircraft available for airlines.
234540	239080	The jet engine then killed the ocean liner industry, which meant airplanes quickly became
239080	244360	the primary method of long-distance passenger transport, which increased demand, which increased
244360	248120	industry innovation, which decreased prices.
248120	252040	Industry deregulation starting in the 70s meant that airlines could compete in a fully
252040	256800	commercial manner, which led to the development of the first low-cost airlines.
256800	262080	These pushed down prices industry-wide, and helped all airlines become a service for all.
262080	268240	Today, on the same Salt Lake City to LA route that Western Air Express flew for $1,400,
268240	271480	airlines regularly sell tickets for $50.
271480	277860	If that same level of price innovation happened in the commercial space industry, the $450,000
277860	284160	Virgin Galactic ticket of today would cost just $16,000—an approachable, once-in-a-lifetime
284160	288320	luxury for well-off, but not absurdly wealthy individuals.
288320	294080	So, can the process that the airline industry went through work for space?
294080	297120	Well, it's actually working already.
297120	301400	In its era, transporting materials on the American Space Shuttle to low-Earth orbit
301400	307600	cost an estimated $7,700 per pound, or $16,900 per kilogram.
307600	312120	SpaceX's Falcon Heavy rocket currently has eight launch contracts with publicly available
312120	316900	pricing data, and excluding those that have other costs included in the top-line numbers,
316900	321120	the average price for these missions sits at $145 million.
321120	328200	Now, while most payloads are far smaller, the Falcon Heavy could, in theory, carry 141,000
328200	337280	pounds or 64 tons into low-Earth orbit, meaning its cost is roughly $1,028 per pound, or $2,261
337280	338280	per kilogram.
338280	343440	A nearly eight-fold reduction in price is impressive, and the trend is expected to continue
343440	347460	as the company's Starship launch system comes online, and industry competition heats
347460	349480	up in the coming years.
349520	354360	SpaceX, along with many other commercial space launch companies, has achieved these cost
354360	359060	reductions largely through a focus on one factor—reusability.
359060	364340	The previous generation of rockets, such as the Atlas V, were not reusable—essentially,
364340	369200	every element of the rocket was built, launched, and never used again.
369200	374120	This understandably inflated costs, creating a perfect opportunity for commercial companies
374120	379680	to come in and develop reusable launch systems to dramatically undercut prices.
379680	385240	This wasn't to the extent of the cost innovation—SpaceX, in particular, achieved success with insourcing,
385240	390800	manufacturing optimization, and inherent private sector cost focus—but reusability did represent
390800	396080	the lowest-hanging fruit, and the first big leap in reducing the cost of reaching space.
396080	398400	So, what's next?
398400	403560	While there's certainly more work to be done, we do know that reusability alone will
403560	407900	not be what brings the cost of space tourism to an achievable level.
407900	413400	For example, running rocket launch facilities is extraordinarily expensive.
413400	416720	While getting an accurate picture of costs is difficult, since most launch companies
416720	421040	have no financial reporting requirements, we do know that when SpaceX started developing
421040	426080	its launch facility at Vandenberg Space Force Base in California, it estimated $40 to $60
426080	432180	million in initial costs, followed by $5 to $10 million in annual ongoing costs.
432180	437860	Using the lower end of those estimates, that means the company has sunk some $85 million
437860	439180	into the facility.
439180	444580	During that time, they used it for 17 launches, representing a per-launch cost of at least
444580	446420	$5 million.
446420	451140	This is almost certainly a gross underestimation, but assuming it were true, that would mean
451140	455480	that SpaceX CEO Elon Musk's claim that their upcoming Starship rocket will operate at a
455480	460900	cost of $2 million per launch is impossible without intense focus on the ground operations
460900	461900	aspect.
461900	466980	The problem is that right now, operating a launch facility is like running Heathrow Airport
466980	472180	for just a couple flights a year—clearly an inefficient process.
472180	476660	Of course, one fix for that is simple—launch more rockets.
476660	481440	The majority of the cost of running a facility like Vandenberg is fixed—launching 100 rockets
481440	486040	a year would not cost 10 times more than launching 10 rockets a year, so by increasing the number
486040	490440	of launches, the company reduces the per-launch facility cost.
490440	494760	This is just one example, but the point is that across the board, much of the remaining
494760	499720	opportunity for cost innovation is not in technology, as was the case with reusable
499720	501840	rockets, but with process.
501840	505920	What the commercial space industry needs is scale.
505920	508200	It was no different with planes.
508200	512040	The miniscule size of the industry in the early years meant that operating a single
512040	515720	plane was extraordinarily expensive.
515720	519440	Early airlines had to do essentially everything themselves.
519440	523480	When Pan Am was working to start clipper service to Hong Kong, for example, they lacked
523480	527560	an existing, necessary refueling point between Midway and Guam.
527560	532360	However, Juan Trippe, the airline's founder, discovered records of a little-known atoll
532360	535800	in exactly the right spot—Wake Island.
535800	539480	He then had to lobby the President to place the atoll under the control of the Navy, then
539480	543880	persuade the Navy to send a boat to survey Wake Island, then negotiate a lease from the
543880	544880	Navy.
544880	548600	Next, the airline hired a freighter ship to bring materials and construction workers to
548600	553240	the atoll, where they built a landing area for the clippers, dock, narrow-gauge railway,
553240	555760	refueling facility, hotel, and more.
555760	560120	The airline had to do all of this just to run their twice-weekly service, simply because
560120	562960	they were the first airline to cross the vast Pacific.
562960	568280	There were simply no economies of scale, which is precisely why a ticket on this service
568280	574980	from San Francisco to Hong Kong cost, inflation-adjusted, $33,000 round-trip.
574980	577840	What happened next, though, was World War II.
577840	581940	The prominent role that aviation played in the conflict spurred the will for infrastructure
581940	587120	to be built, for development to be conducted, and simply for more planes to be built.
587120	590320	Altogether, it pushed prices down.
590320	595560	This can happen in the commercial space industry, too, because economies of scale exist in every
595560	596560	industry.
596560	601760	The problem for them, though, is that space doesn't have a World War II.
601760	607640	So far, there hasn't been a massive external factor that rapidly scaled the industry.
607640	613720	So, it's a classic catch-22—the industry cannot scale without reduced costs, and it
613720	617000	cannot reduce costs without scale.
617000	621520	Every new industry faces this conundrum, and every large industry has resolved this conundrum,
621520	625600	but it might be tougher for the space launch industry than most.
625600	630640	In any case, there are essentially two ways to pass the scale hurdle—you wait for demand
630640	635360	to grow, or you gamble with scaling before the demand comes in order to reduce costs,
635360	637320	which should increase demand.
637320	641840	The problem with the former is that right now, there's not really much reason to go
641840	642920	to space.
642920	648000	For everyone but government-employed astronauts, the reason to go to space is to go to space,
648000	652100	and once they're there, the only thing to do is to be in space.
652100	657560	The number of people today who both can afford to and want to go to space is miniscule, and
657560	662160	it's abundantly clear that tourism alone will not spur the kind of demand growth needed
662160	666560	to reduce costs enough to induce a rapid spiral effect of industry growth.
666560	668900	So, why don't they gamble?
668900	673720	This is, in effect, how every startup surpasses the scale conundrum—they take on investment
673720	678780	or debt, scale up, reduce their costs, open to a larger market of consumers, and use the
678780	681680	greater earnings to pay back their investors or creditors.
681680	687800	Now, to be clear, nearly every space launch company does this—SpaceX, Blue Origin, Virgin
687800	690240	Orbit, and Rocket Lab are each investor-driven.
690240	695360	It's impossible to surpass the rocket development process without investment, because the businesses
695360	698680	can't earn revenue until after the rockets are developed.
698680	704200	However, no company has yet taken on the level of investment or debt needed to scale their
704200	708520	process beyond current demand in order to dramatically reduce costs.
708520	712400	That's because the industry has a data problem.
712400	717280	Right now, there are just so few space launch customers that it's impossible to accurately
717280	719880	model how the market works.
719880	724280	In most industries, companies have a good idea of their product's price elasticity
724280	725280	of demand.
725280	730160	That's a measure of the extent to which demand changes given a change in price.
730160	735760	For example, consumer fuel demand is very inelastic—when people need to drive, they
735760	740280	need to drive—so they'll pay for fuel no matter the price.
740280	745640	One study found its price elasticity is negative .09, meaning if someone buys 10 gallons at
745640	751760	a price of $3 per gallon, they'll still buy 9.75 gallons when the price rises to $4.
751760	757400	Meanwhile, the demand for a can of Coca-Cola is found to be very price elastic.
757400	761640	If someone buys 10 a month at $1, they'll only buy 4 a month if the price is raised
761640	764640	by 25 cents—at least theoretically.
764640	769560	This data is crucially useful for businesses to determine whether an investment in reducing
769560	774240	costs is worth it—they can directly compare how much they'll have to spend versus how
774240	776860	much additional revenue it should bring in.
776860	781160	This is exactly how businesses make these investment decisions.
781160	788480	However, in 2020, SpaceX had just six different customers—NASA, the US Space Force, the
788480	793960	South Korean Army, the Argentinian Space Agency, Sirius XM, and the US's National Reconnaissance
793960	795320	Office.
795320	800080	With six customers and their 12 launches, there just isn't enough data to accurately
800080	802520	model price elasticity.
802520	807180	SpaceX just doesn't know, for example, whether investing a billion dollars in reducing launch
807180	812020	costs by $10 million would be worth it—they don't know if it would induce enough additional
812020	814680	demand to compensate for the cost.
814680	819280	This is the big reason why the industry cannot invest in scaling dramatically—it would
819280	823560	just be a crapshoot, which is far too risky for a commercial company.
823560	828620	So, the industry is largely reduced to waiting for the first option—waiting for demand
828620	829700	to come.
829700	832720	The industry needs their World War II.
832720	838600	Now, of course, space-based warfare is rather unlikely and extremely undesirable, but there
838600	842620	is potentially another way that demand for getting both materials and people to space
842620	847680	could ramp up rapidly—space-based industry.
847720	851880	Space-based industry is, of course, a different environment than that of Earth.
851880	856640	Therefore, it enables the manufacturing of materials that Earth cannot.
856640	861520	For example, one of the nearest, most realistic possibilities for space-based manufacturing
861520	863440	is in fiber optics.
863440	868000	These cables are incredibly efficient at moving huge quantities of data over long distances,
868000	872000	so they act as the backbone of the world's communications infrastructure.
872040	878640	Therefore, the manufacturing of them has turned into a massive, extremely fast-growing industry.
878640	884900	Now, ZBLAN is a type of fluoride glass that theoretically could make fiber optic cables
884900	889520	orders of magnitude more efficient, but the problem is that when manufacturing these in
889520	894640	Earth's gravity, tiny crystals and bubbles appear that restrict data transmission.
894640	901020	However, in space, when manufactured in microgravity, the fiber is clear, meaning these hypothetical
901020	904580	orders of magnitude efficiency gains are realized.
904580	910380	In addition, ZBLAN fiber optics would be incredibly price-dense—a single kilogram of the material
910380	914220	would sell for hundreds of thousands or millions of dollars.
914220	920180	So, this is a near-term case of something that can be made in space, has demand on Earth,
920180	924500	for which the transportation process would not be cost prohibitive.
924500	926900	This is crucial.
926900	930420	This is what could start the space gold rush.
930420	935460	If there is an in-demand industry that can only be conducted in space, people and materials
935460	938260	would need to get to and from space.
938260	941880	That would scale the launch industry, which would lower launch costs, which would enable
941880	945780	more industries in space, which would scale the launch industry, which would lower launch
945780	948980	costs, and so on and so forth.
948980	952420	So, what's the answer?
952420	956740	When will you and I be able to travel to what's beyond?
956740	964100	Well, as of yet, this natural cycle of scale and growth, this gold rush, has yet to begin.
964100	967900	However, it seems that it could be near.
967900	974040	So, the industry to watch is less that of space launches, and more that of space-based
974040	975680	industries.
975680	980980	On Earth, there has been reason to travel since the beginning of civilization—airplanes
980980	986820	as a technology came into existence as a replacement for other methods of travel.
986820	991300	Rockets are enabling travel to a new place, to which there is currently little reason
991300	992580	to travel.
992580	997420	Therefore, industry will be what gives that crucial reason for travel.
997420	1002340	The airline industry never grew off of tourists, because few tourists could afford the fares
1002340	1004100	in the early days.
1004100	1009000	It grew off of companies and governments finding rational reasons to send people around the
1009000	1012400	world by plane, whether for war or business.
1012400	1016620	The tourists followed in increasing numbers based on the price reductions that others
1016620	1018180	induced.
1018180	1020120	Space will not be different.
1020120	1025720	At its deepest level, enabling low-cost access is not a technological problem—it's an
1025720	1027360	economic one.
1027360	1029560	So, follow the money.
1029560	1033280	Once you start seeing products coming from space, that's when your ticket to what's
1033280	1038060	beyond will start to become cheap.
1038060	1042480	One industry that's yet to see much cost disruption is that of delivery food.
1042480	1046540	With all those fees added on by the apps, it's quite expensive to have food delivered
1046540	1047760	to your door.
1047760	1050340	Many still do, though, since it's convenient.
1050340	1056100	I certainly did, until I realized how poor it was for my health, my wallet, and the environment.
1056100	1058460	Therefore, I switched to HelloFresh.
1058460	1062780	Now I pick out all the meals I want, and the following week, a box arrives on my doorstep
1062780	1065180	with all the ingredients and recipes.
1065180	1069100	For example, this week I made the meatballs with bulgogi sauce, which were rather quick
1069100	1074380	to make, since all the ingredients came in the exact right quantities, and also delicious.
1074380	1078220	This is all completely true, by the way—I was using HelloFresh for almost a year before
1078220	1082740	they sponsored a video, and I genuinely value the convenience of cutting out shopping, researching
1082740	1087540	recipes, and long prep times, while still being able to make fresh, healthy, home-cooked
1087540	1088540	meals.
1088540	1092620	Also, University of Michigan research found that HelloFresh cuts down on food waste by
1092620	1097380	25% compared to grocery shopping, since you get everything in the exact right quantities,
1097380	1102780	and the box it all ships in is made almost entirely out of recyclable or recycled materials.
