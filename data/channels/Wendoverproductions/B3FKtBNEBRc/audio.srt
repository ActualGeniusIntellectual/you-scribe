3
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:17,440
Ten years ago, in May 2011, Adele's Rolling in the Deep was topping the Billboard charts,

4
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:21,600
the first season of Game of Thrones was on its way to becoming a television phenomenon,

5
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:26,560
Osama bin Laden had just been killed by US Navy Seals, and the International Olympic Committee

6
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:30,800
was sending letters to national Olympic committees, soliciting bids to host the

7
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:37,600
32nd running of the Summer Olympic Games. This moment marked the start of a decade-long process

8
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:44,080
of planning and preparation, all leading up to a mere 16 days of international sporting competition.

9
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:50,400
Step two was this. One month later, the governor of Tokyo, Japan announced his city's intention

10
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:56,080
to submit a bid—in large part to mark their recovery from the massive 20,000 death earthquake

11
00:00:56,080 --> 00:01:02,080
that had devastated the country mere months before. Soon enough, Madrid, Istanbul, Baku,

12
00:01:02,080 --> 00:01:08,560
and Doha each submitted bids as well but, in the end, after a two-year evaluation process,

13
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:13,360
a contract was signed between the International Olympic Committee, the Japanese Olympic Committee,

14
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:20,640
and the city of Tokyo in September 2013. Tokyo would host the 2020 Summer Olympic Games.

15
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:25,680
For an event of this scale, tens of thousands of athletes, millions of spectators,

16
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:30,640
and billions of television viewers, a mere seven-year planning period, believe it or not,

17
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:35,840
leaves no time to waste. The most watched television broadcast in existence needs to

18
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:40,640
be planned, a whole village needs to be constructed, dozens of stadiums and venues

19
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:45,520
need to be built, refurbished, or adapted, and one of the world's largest cities needs to plan

20
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:52,320
for what might be the busiest three weeks of its existence. To complete this task, Tokyo was given

21
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:59,040
this—the host city contract operational requirements document. Across its 273 pages,

22
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:04,480
this outlines, in incredible detail, what the International Olympic Committee, or IOC,

23
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:09,920
requires from its contractual partner, Tokyo, in order to complete the Olympics successfully and,

24
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:16,640
crucially, consistently with all past and future games. It's essentially the Bible for Olympic

25
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:23,600
organizers. The 2015 edition, made for the 2020 Games, now being held in 2021, outlines some

26
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:29,440
absolutely minuscule details. For example, Tokyo had to install weather stations at the sites of

27
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:34,080
all outdoor competition venues three years prior to the start of the Games in order to collect

28
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:39,520
long-term data to be used by the IOC to inform their scheduling of events. The document also

29
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:44,320
establishes some basic but far-reaching guidelines, such as the fact that the Olympics will last 16

30
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:49,280
days, except for a certain number of preliminary competitions that, subject to IOC approval,

31
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:54,240
can be held prior to the opening ceremony. It also, in a matter of mere paragraphs,

32
00:02:54,240 --> 00:03:01,600
outlines massive asks, such as the necessity for Tokyo to book 41,177 hotel rooms for the media,

33
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:05,200
marketing partners, future host city representatives, IOC executives,

34
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:09,040
National Olympic Committee representatives, International Sport Federation representatives,

35
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:15,120
and more. This is equivalent to close to half of all of Tokyo's hotel rooms, and it only represents

36
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:19,760
the accommodation requirements for those actually running the Games—not those competing or

37
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:24,720
spectating. The hotel capacity crunch was such an issue, in fact, that prior to the prohibition

38
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:29,120
of international spectators due to the coronavirus pandemic, the city had planned to dock cruise

39
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:35,440
ships in Tokyo Bay to serve as additional, temporary hotels. Athletes, however, do not

40
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:41,680
stay on hotels. Since the 1932 Los Angeles Games, each host city constructs a dedicated

41
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:47,120
Olympics village to house athletes—far away from the crowds of fans and hordes of media.

42
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:52,720
Now, the IOC's operational requirements set strict standards to assure that, for the most part,

43
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:59,040
the 2012 village is just like the 2020 village, for all practical purposes. For example, it has

44
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:04,800
to be within 50 kilometers, 31 miles, or a 60-minute drive of all venues, so if any event

45
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:09,920
takes place further from the main host city, an additional village is constructed. This is

46
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:14,240
especially relevant for the Winter Games, with which indoor sports often happen within the main

47
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:19,600
host city, but outdoor events happen further away at mountain resorts. For example, in the case of

48
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:24,800
the 2014 Games, a primary village was constructed in Sochi, while an additional one was set up at

49
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:30,640
the Rosa Kutor Ski Resort where snow sports events took place. For the Summer Games in Tokyo, however,

50
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:35,120
just one village was constructed, and the operational requirements dictated that it must

51
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:41,280
have the capacity for 16,000 people, so it operates at the scale of a small town. The

52
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:46,880
requirements also dictate that rooms must be at least 97 square feet or 9 meters in size,

53
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:52,960
or 129 square feet or 12 meters with double rooms, and even outline the required contents.

54
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:59,120
In addition, the village must have an Olympics merchandise store, a bank, photo store, hair salon,

55
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:05,280
florist, dry cleaning shop, travel agent, post office, and more. Typically, McDonald's also sets

56
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:09,920
up a temporary restaurant in the village for the games, which is like any McDonald's except that

57
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:14,560
its menu has no prices—the company provides athletes with food for free in exchange for

58
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:20,240
the publicity it inevitably attracts. Lastly, according to the operational requirements document,

59
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:26,320
the village even must have a designated place of mourning. Now, constructing brand new dedicated

60
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:33,200
venues, such as the village, for the purposes of a 16-day event, quite obviously presents problems.

61
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:37,600
While in decades past cities were essentially willing to throw any amount of money at the games,

62
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:42,160
and sometimes ram at hundreds of percents over budget, due to a belief that the publicity they

63
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:47,680
attracted was invaluable, taxpayers, and therefore governments, are increasingly skeptical of the

64
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:53,120
value that the games truly provides for a city and country. There are plenty of horror stories

65
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:58,240
of places like Turin, Italy, the host of the 2006 games, whose village now sits derelict and is

66
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:03,120
inhabited by squatters—essentially a complete waste of money from the perspective of the city,

67
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:08,400
and therefore its taxpayers. There are also, however, cases like that of Sydney,

68
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:13,840
which redeveloped its Olympics park into a true neighborhood. It's now home to upscale hotels,

69
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:20,080
restaurants, and housing complexes, and hosts nearly 6,000 events both large and small each

70
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:26,000
year. Altogether, having seen the horror stories, the Olympics are becoming less attractive for

71
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:31,120
cities. In decades past, plenty of cities would bid to host each Olympics, but now there are

72
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:36,720
situations like Paris 2024 or Los Angeles 2028 where cities are awarded the games effectively

73
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:42,480
by default, having faced zero competition in the bidding process. For those that do host the games,

74
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:46,880
though, cost consciousness has increased dramatically, and they're now trying to

75
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:51,120
craft their venue strategy closer to that of Sydney rather than Turin.

76
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:58,640
In Tokyo, three categories of Olympic venues are being used. The first is temporary. With

77
00:06:58,640 --> 00:07:03,680
certain events, such as canoeing, climbing, beach volleyball, or sailing, there's little prospect

78
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:07,600
that the city can redevelop the venue into something self-sustaining after the games,

79
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:11,520
so they either set up spectator and media facilities at existing sporting facilities

80
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:16,640
that just lack the scale to host an Olympic event, or they set up an entirely new, temporary venue.

81
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:20,720
For more popular sports that require less specialized facilities, however,

82
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:25,680
Tokyo is using pre-existing venues around the city. For example, with table tennis,

83
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:30,480
which requires little infrastructure, the Tokyo Metropolitan Gymnasium is being used,

84
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:36,560
just as it was during the 1964 Tokyo Olympics for gymnastics. With certain events, however,

85
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:42,960
the Tokyo organizers believed it was actually worth it to build a brand new venue. Swimming

86
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:47,760
and diving events, for example, will happen at the brand new Olympics Aquatics Center.

87
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:53,040
This is often the case at summer games. Swimming and diving are typically some of the most watched

88
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:58,080
sports at the Olympics, despite mediocre popularity as a spectator sport outside the games.

89
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:02,960
That means cities often lack aquatics venues with the scale necessary for Olympic events,

90
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:08,400
so this is one of the venues more often built as new. At the 2016 Rio de Janeiro games,

91
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:14,240
a temporary aquatic stadium was built, while at London 2012, Beijing 2008, Sydney 2000,

92
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:20,800
and plenty more, new, permanent facilities were created. Now, with each of these new, permanent

93
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:26,880
venues, the Bureau of Olympic and Paralympic Games Tokyo 2020 preparation had to justify

94
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:33,200
their long-term value beyond the games to the government and public. Therefore, they released

95
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:38,160
this document. It outlines the core of their development strategy—they want to create not

96
00:08:38,160 --> 00:08:42,160
only effective venues, but an appealing neighborhood, certainly following the model

97
00:08:42,160 --> 00:08:48,000
of Sydney 2000, so that they can consider any money spent an investment rather than a cost.

98
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:52,560
With each of these new venues, such as the new Olympic Aquatics Center, for example,

99
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:57,920
they've published a detailed post-games plan. Through redeveloping the venue into both a

100
00:08:57,920 --> 00:09:02,480
long-term competition venue and a community recreation center, the Bureau believes they

101
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:06,720
can attract a million visitors per year after the games, and while they project the facility

102
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:11,280
to run at a loss, it's one small enough to be comparable with other similar public recreation

103
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:16,400
centers created outside of the context of the Olympics. Some of the other venues, such as the

104
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:21,520
Ariake Arena, to be used for volleyball, are expected to turn a profit after the games,

105
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:27,600
so altogether, if projections are accurate, these new venues won't be a long-term financial burden

106
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:33,920
to the city and its taxpayers. Now, of course, like with anything regarding the Olympics,

107
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:40,800
each of the 42 venues need to follow a sprawling set of strict standards. For example, they each

108
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:45,280
need to have the Olympics flag and respective International Sporting Federation flag flying

109
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:50,800
in a conspicuous spot. They need to have a full backup power system for all broadcast, media,

110
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:56,000
technology, sport, and security operations, while their lighting systems must be split into two

111
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:00,880
sections with independent power supplies for each so that events can go on even through power

112
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:06,000
failure. In terms of the actual sporting facilities, however, these are each subject

113
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:11,680
to the standards of the respective IOC-recognized International Sports Federation. For example,

114
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:16,960
Olympic Rowing is managed by the International Rowing Federation, which recommends 531 feet or

115
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:25,440
162 meters of course width, and requires 2,162 meters or 7,126 feet of length. Their standards

116
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:30,400
get plenty more specific, though—they specify the intricacies of the course buoy system,

117
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:35,360
outline where advertising banners can go, detail the location, construction, and operation of

118
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:41,920
timing huts, and much, much more. Each Olympic event is essentially the pinnacle of its sport,

119
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:49,360
so the International Federations are heavily involved. Of course, the Olympics are a made-for-television

120
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:55,920
event. While millions of spectators do typically watch the games in person, billions watch on TV.

121
00:10:56,560 --> 00:11:03,120
In fact, 73% of the Olympics' total revenue comes from television rights alone—they simply would

122
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:08,560
not happen in their modern form if not for their massive television audience, so perhaps the most

123
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:14,960
important facility of all is this—the International Broadcast Center. In Tokyo,

124
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:19,200
this facility is constructed in Tokyo Big Sight, the country's largest convention center,

125
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:24,480
and is run by the Olympics Broadcasting Services, or OBS. Now, for the longest time,

126
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:28,480
broadcasting operations were something that the International Olympic Committee would contract

127
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:33,840
out to a third party, but in advance of the 2008 Beijing Olympics, OBS was established to act as

128
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:39,920
the host broadcaster for all future games. Now, like with most large sporting events,

129
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:45,280
you won't see cameras from NBC, BBC, Eurosport, and all the other national broadcasters that

130
00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:51,520
carry the events on TV actually at each event. That's because OBS is responsible for filming

131
00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:56,080
and producing each event, and then they provide produced feeds to each broadcaster,

132
00:11:56,080 --> 00:12:01,120
who acts as their customer. While NBC, for example, might have reporters and commentators

133
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:07,040
at each event to augment the OBS feeds, they don't actually film the sporting events themselves.

134
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:15,360
Now, OBS is a standalone, independent company set up by the IOC to fulfill these broadcast functions.

135
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:21,840
While typically it has some 166 employees, this balloons up to 8,100 during the games,

136
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:26,560
mostly comprised of the operational staff filming and producing the television feeds.

137
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:33,360
Its ultimate task in Tokyo is to create 9,500 hours of content—more than with any prior

138
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:41,120
Olympic Games. To accomplish this, it has deployed some 1,049 cameras and 3,600 microphones across

139
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:47,040
Tokyo's 42 venues. These are cut together into produced world feeds in dedicated broadcast

140
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:52,560
compounds at each venue, before being delivered to HERE—the International Broadcast Center.

141
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:58,160
From one month before the games until its conclusion, this is a 24-7 operation and,

142
00:12:58,160 --> 00:13:03,200
much like the Olympics Village, operates like a small town, with restaurants, coffee shops,

143
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:08,640
bars, a medical center, bank, convenience store, dry cleaners, and even a massage room.

144
00:13:08,640 --> 00:13:13,600
Many of OBS's facilities at the International Broadcast Center deal with the technical aspects

145
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:18,720
of taking the world feeds, of which as many as 64 are produced simultaneously in the case of Day 2

146
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:23,680
of the games, and disseminating these out to all the different rights-holding broadcasters around

147
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:29,680
the world. However, in addition to television production, much of the purpose of this facility

148
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:34,160
is to act as a workspace for all the journalists from around the world who have traveled to the

149
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:40,240
games. During the Olympics, one of OBS's main functions is essentially as a landlord—they

150
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:45,440
manage the International Broadcast Center and rent out space to different broadcasters to serve

151
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:51,520
as their workspaces. A private office in the center comes in units of 270 square feet or 25

152
00:13:51,520 --> 00:13:58,240
square meters, and in the case of Tokyo, costs some $5,011 per unit for the duration of the games.

153
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:05,120
Of course, though, there are plenty of upcharges. Even once a broadcaster is paid to rent a space,

154
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:11,360
two normal wall plugs will cost them $876, and the OBS rate card even includes the option to

155
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:17,120
purchase a power strip for $27. Meanwhile, getting a dedicated 100 megabit per second

156
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:23,600
ethernet plug, to provide more stable internet than the free wifi, costs broadcasters $19,044.

157
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:30,320
OBS also sells broadcasters a digital data feed, giving real-time access to results, schedules,

158
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:35,680
medals, records, news, biographies, statistics, and more. This is what ultimately gets repackaged

159
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:41,920
into, for example, the real-time results you'll see on the NBC or the BBC websites. Finally,

160
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:46,480
OBS's rate card includes options to outfit a broadcaster's private office with a walkie-talkie

161
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:55,920
for $438, small folding table for $67, microwave for $105, and electric kettle for $23. With 6,000

162
00:14:55,920 --> 00:15:01,200
accredited journalists awarded access to the Tokyo games, it's as much a job to manage them as the

163
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:06,320
athletes and, while procuring an electric kettle for an LA Times sportswriter might seem like a

164
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:11,920
trivial task, it makes the journalists' jobs easier, and doing so plays a tiny, but present

165
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:17,680
part in helping the Olympics run smoothly. Now, ultimately, while there are plenty of

166
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:23,040
big decisions required in planning the Olympics, there are few small ones. For the most part,

167
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:28,320
the host city's jobs are just to follow an incredibly detailed set of instructions.

168
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:34,000
They spend the better part of a decade doing exactly that, but the ultimate goal of the 2020

169
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:40,000
games is to make an event that's just as successful and runs largely the same as the games of 2016,

170
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:46,960
2012, 2008, or any year before. The goal is consistency, and therefore the task,

171
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:52,480
while enormous, is strictly prescribed. That doesn't mean it's straightforward, though—every

172
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:57,600
page of this document represents an incredible amount of work. A single line might become an

173
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:02,880
individual's job for years, and then actually putting that together, combining the tasks as

174
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:08,320
small as placing the right flag in a venue with those as large as building an entirely new stadium,

175
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:12,240
is what makes for a truly successful and impressive event.

176
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:20,800
As anyone knows by now, the 2020 Tokyo Olympic Games are actually happening in 2021. Of course,

177
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:25,840
taking one of the world's largest events and postponing it by a year mere months before,

178
00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:31,600
after a decade of preparation, is an incredible feat. I didn't have time to cover that in this

179
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:37,760
video, but for those interested, I made a companion video about the subject and put it on Nebula.

180
00:16:37,760 --> 00:16:42,720
Nebula, of course, is always home to our normal videos early and ad-free, exclusive companion

181
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:47,600
videos such as this, and big-budget Nebula originals—and it's not only us, but also

182
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:53,360
tons of your favorite educational creators such as Real Engineering, MKBHD, and Lindsay Ellis.

183
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:59,760
Of course, what makes Nebula even better is the best way to get access to it—the CuriosityStream

184
00:16:59,760 --> 00:17:04,000
bundle deal. That's because CuriosityStream is home to an endless catalog of top-quality

185
00:17:04,080 --> 00:17:09,040
non-fiction shows and documentaries, such as The Tulip Bubble. This is a really well-made

186
00:17:09,040 --> 00:17:13,840
documentary about one of my favorite pieces of historical trivia—the time when tulip bulbs were

187
00:17:13,840 --> 00:17:18,480
sold quite literally for their weight in gold, and how the financial markets surrounding them

188
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:24,320
demonstrated one of the first stories of boom and bust. So, you can get Nebula and CuriosityStream

189
00:17:24,320 --> 00:17:30,400
together, including tons of video content that you'll actually watch, for an unbelievable price—just

190
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:36,080
$14.79 a year with the current sale at CuriosityStream.com slash Wendover.

191
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:41,920
That truly has to be the best deal in streaming, and signing up helps support not only Wendover,

192
00:17:41,920 --> 00:17:50,640
but all these independent creators, so head to CuriosityStream.com slash Wendover.
