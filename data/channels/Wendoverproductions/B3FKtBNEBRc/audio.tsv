11520	17440	Ten years ago, in May 2011, Adele's Rolling in the Deep was topping the Billboard charts,
17440	21600	the first season of Game of Thrones was on its way to becoming a television phenomenon,
21600	26560	Osama bin Laden had just been killed by US Navy Seals, and the International Olympic Committee
26560	30800	was sending letters to national Olympic committees, soliciting bids to host the
30800	37600	32nd running of the Summer Olympic Games. This moment marked the start of a decade-long process
37600	44080	of planning and preparation, all leading up to a mere 16 days of international sporting competition.
44640	50400	Step two was this. One month later, the governor of Tokyo, Japan announced his city's intention
50400	56080	to submit a bid—in large part to mark their recovery from the massive 20,000 death earthquake
56080	62080	that had devastated the country mere months before. Soon enough, Madrid, Istanbul, Baku,
62080	68560	and Doha each submitted bids as well but, in the end, after a two-year evaluation process,
68560	73360	a contract was signed between the International Olympic Committee, the Japanese Olympic Committee,
73360	80640	and the city of Tokyo in September 2013. Tokyo would host the 2020 Summer Olympic Games.
81280	85680	For an event of this scale, tens of thousands of athletes, millions of spectators,
85680	90640	and billions of television viewers, a mere seven-year planning period, believe it or not,
90640	95840	leaves no time to waste. The most watched television broadcast in existence needs to
95840	100640	be planned, a whole village needs to be constructed, dozens of stadiums and venues
100640	105520	need to be built, refurbished, or adapted, and one of the world's largest cities needs to plan
105520	112320	for what might be the busiest three weeks of its existence. To complete this task, Tokyo was given
112320	119040	this—the host city contract operational requirements document. Across its 273 pages,
119040	124480	this outlines, in incredible detail, what the International Olympic Committee, or IOC,
124480	129920	requires from its contractual partner, Tokyo, in order to complete the Olympics successfully and,
129920	136640	crucially, consistently with all past and future games. It's essentially the Bible for Olympic
136640	143600	organizers. The 2015 edition, made for the 2020 Games, now being held in 2021, outlines some
143600	149440	absolutely minuscule details. For example, Tokyo had to install weather stations at the sites of
149440	154080	all outdoor competition venues three years prior to the start of the Games in order to collect
154080	159520	long-term data to be used by the IOC to inform their scheduling of events. The document also
159520	164320	establishes some basic but far-reaching guidelines, such as the fact that the Olympics will last 16
164320	169280	days, except for a certain number of preliminary competitions that, subject to IOC approval,
169280	174240	can be held prior to the opening ceremony. It also, in a matter of mere paragraphs,
174240	181600	outlines massive asks, such as the necessity for Tokyo to book 41,177 hotel rooms for the media,
181600	185200	marketing partners, future host city representatives, IOC executives,
185200	189040	National Olympic Committee representatives, International Sport Federation representatives,
189040	195120	and more. This is equivalent to close to half of all of Tokyo's hotel rooms, and it only represents
195120	199760	the accommodation requirements for those actually running the Games—not those competing or
199760	204720	spectating. The hotel capacity crunch was such an issue, in fact, that prior to the prohibition
204720	209120	of international spectators due to the coronavirus pandemic, the city had planned to dock cruise
209120	215440	ships in Tokyo Bay to serve as additional, temporary hotels. Athletes, however, do not
215440	221680	stay on hotels. Since the 1932 Los Angeles Games, each host city constructs a dedicated
221680	227120	Olympics village to house athletes—far away from the crowds of fans and hordes of media.
227120	232720	Now, the IOC's operational requirements set strict standards to assure that, for the most part,
232720	239040	the 2012 village is just like the 2020 village, for all practical purposes. For example, it has
239040	244800	to be within 50 kilometers, 31 miles, or a 60-minute drive of all venues, so if any event
244880	249920	takes place further from the main host city, an additional village is constructed. This is
249920	254240	especially relevant for the Winter Games, with which indoor sports often happen within the main
254240	259600	host city, but outdoor events happen further away at mountain resorts. For example, in the case of
259600	264800	the 2014 Games, a primary village was constructed in Sochi, while an additional one was set up at
264800	270640	the Rosa Kutor Ski Resort where snow sports events took place. For the Summer Games in Tokyo, however,
270640	275120	just one village was constructed, and the operational requirements dictated that it must
275120	281280	have the capacity for 16,000 people, so it operates at the scale of a small town. The
281280	286880	requirements also dictate that rooms must be at least 97 square feet or 9 meters in size,
286880	292960	or 129 square feet or 12 meters with double rooms, and even outline the required contents.
293600	299120	In addition, the village must have an Olympics merchandise store, a bank, photo store, hair salon,
299120	305280	florist, dry cleaning shop, travel agent, post office, and more. Typically, McDonald's also sets
305280	309920	up a temporary restaurant in the village for the games, which is like any McDonald's except that
309920	314560	its menu has no prices—the company provides athletes with food for free in exchange for
314560	320240	the publicity it inevitably attracts. Lastly, according to the operational requirements document,
320240	326320	the village even must have a designated place of mourning. Now, constructing brand new dedicated
326320	333200	venues, such as the village, for the purposes of a 16-day event, quite obviously presents problems.
333200	337600	While in decades past cities were essentially willing to throw any amount of money at the games,
337600	342160	and sometimes ram at hundreds of percents over budget, due to a belief that the publicity they
342160	347680	attracted was invaluable, taxpayers, and therefore governments, are increasingly skeptical of the
347680	353120	value that the games truly provides for a city and country. There are plenty of horror stories
353200	358240	of places like Turin, Italy, the host of the 2006 games, whose village now sits derelict and is
358240	363120	inhabited by squatters—essentially a complete waste of money from the perspective of the city,
363120	368400	and therefore its taxpayers. There are also, however, cases like that of Sydney,
368400	373840	which redeveloped its Olympics park into a true neighborhood. It's now home to upscale hotels,
373840	380080	restaurants, and housing complexes, and hosts nearly 6,000 events both large and small each
380080	386000	year. Altogether, having seen the horror stories, the Olympics are becoming less attractive for
386000	391120	cities. In decades past, plenty of cities would bid to host each Olympics, but now there are
391120	396720	situations like Paris 2024 or Los Angeles 2028 where cities are awarded the games effectively
396720	402480	by default, having faced zero competition in the bidding process. For those that do host the games,
402480	406880	though, cost consciousness has increased dramatically, and they're now trying to
406880	411120	craft their venue strategy closer to that of Sydney rather than Turin.
411840	418640	In Tokyo, three categories of Olympic venues are being used. The first is temporary. With
418640	423680	certain events, such as canoeing, climbing, beach volleyball, or sailing, there's little prospect
423680	427600	that the city can redevelop the venue into something self-sustaining after the games,
427600	431520	so they either set up spectator and media facilities at existing sporting facilities
431520	436640	that just lack the scale to host an Olympic event, or they set up an entirely new, temporary venue.
437040	440720	For more popular sports that require less specialized facilities, however,
440720	445680	Tokyo is using pre-existing venues around the city. For example, with table tennis,
445680	450480	which requires little infrastructure, the Tokyo Metropolitan Gymnasium is being used,
450480	456560	just as it was during the 1964 Tokyo Olympics for gymnastics. With certain events, however,
456560	462960	the Tokyo organizers believed it was actually worth it to build a brand new venue. Swimming
462960	467760	and diving events, for example, will happen at the brand new Olympics Aquatics Center.
467760	473040	This is often the case at summer games. Swimming and diving are typically some of the most watched
473040	478080	sports at the Olympics, despite mediocre popularity as a spectator sport outside the games.
478080	482960	That means cities often lack aquatics venues with the scale necessary for Olympic events,
482960	488400	so this is one of the venues more often built as new. At the 2016 Rio de Janeiro games,
488400	494240	a temporary aquatic stadium was built, while at London 2012, Beijing 2008, Sydney 2000,
494240	500800	and plenty more, new, permanent facilities were created. Now, with each of these new, permanent
500800	506880	venues, the Bureau of Olympic and Paralympic Games Tokyo 2020 preparation had to justify
506880	513200	their long-term value beyond the games to the government and public. Therefore, they released
513200	518160	this document. It outlines the core of their development strategy—they want to create not
518160	522160	only effective venues, but an appealing neighborhood, certainly following the model
522160	528000	of Sydney 2000, so that they can consider any money spent an investment rather than a cost.
528000	532560	With each of these new venues, such as the new Olympic Aquatics Center, for example,
532560	537920	they've published a detailed post-games plan. Through redeveloping the venue into both a
537920	542480	long-term competition venue and a community recreation center, the Bureau believes they
542480	546720	can attract a million visitors per year after the games, and while they project the facility
546720	551280	to run at a loss, it's one small enough to be comparable with other similar public recreation
551280	556400	centers created outside of the context of the Olympics. Some of the other venues, such as the
556400	561520	Ariake Arena, to be used for volleyball, are expected to turn a profit after the games,
561520	567600	so altogether, if projections are accurate, these new venues won't be a long-term financial burden
567600	573920	to the city and its taxpayers. Now, of course, like with anything regarding the Olympics,
573920	580800	each of the 42 venues need to follow a sprawling set of strict standards. For example, they each
580800	585280	need to have the Olympics flag and respective International Sporting Federation flag flying
585280	590800	in a conspicuous spot. They need to have a full backup power system for all broadcast, media,
590800	596000	technology, sport, and security operations, while their lighting systems must be split into two
596000	600880	sections with independent power supplies for each so that events can go on even through power
600880	606000	failure. In terms of the actual sporting facilities, however, these are each subject
606000	611680	to the standards of the respective IOC-recognized International Sports Federation. For example,
611680	616960	Olympic Rowing is managed by the International Rowing Federation, which recommends 531 feet or
616960	625440	162 meters of course width, and requires 2,162 meters or 7,126 feet of length. Their standards
625440	630400	get plenty more specific, though—they specify the intricacies of the course buoy system,
630480	635360	outline where advertising banners can go, detail the location, construction, and operation of
635360	641920	timing huts, and much, much more. Each Olympic event is essentially the pinnacle of its sport,
641920	649360	so the International Federations are heavily involved. Of course, the Olympics are a made-for-television
649360	655920	event. While millions of spectators do typically watch the games in person, billions watch on TV.
656560	663120	In fact, 73% of the Olympics' total revenue comes from television rights alone—they simply would
663120	668560	not happen in their modern form if not for their massive television audience, so perhaps the most
668560	674960	important facility of all is this—the International Broadcast Center. In Tokyo,
674960	679200	this facility is constructed in Tokyo Big Sight, the country's largest convention center,
679200	684480	and is run by the Olympics Broadcasting Services, or OBS. Now, for the longest time,
684480	688480	broadcasting operations were something that the International Olympic Committee would contract
688480	693840	out to a third party, but in advance of the 2008 Beijing Olympics, OBS was established to act as
693840	699920	the host broadcaster for all future games. Now, like with most large sporting events,
699920	705280	you won't see cameras from NBC, BBC, Eurosport, and all the other national broadcasters that
705280	711520	carry the events on TV actually at each event. That's because OBS is responsible for filming
711520	716080	and producing each event, and then they provide produced feeds to each broadcaster,
716080	721120	who acts as their customer. While NBC, for example, might have reporters and commentators
721120	727040	at each event to augment the OBS feeds, they don't actually film the sporting events themselves.
727760	735360	Now, OBS is a standalone, independent company set up by the IOC to fulfill these broadcast functions.
735360	741840	While typically it has some 166 employees, this balloons up to 8,100 during the games,
741840	746560	mostly comprised of the operational staff filming and producing the television feeds.
746560	753360	Its ultimate task in Tokyo is to create 9,500 hours of content—more than with any prior
753360	761120	Olympic Games. To accomplish this, it has deployed some 1,049 cameras and 3,600 microphones across
761120	767040	Tokyo's 42 venues. These are cut together into produced world feeds in dedicated broadcast
767040	772560	compounds at each venue, before being delivered to HERE—the International Broadcast Center.
772560	778160	From one month before the games until its conclusion, this is a 24-7 operation and,
778160	783200	much like the Olympics Village, operates like a small town, with restaurants, coffee shops,
783200	788640	bars, a medical center, bank, convenience store, dry cleaners, and even a massage room.
788640	793600	Many of OBS's facilities at the International Broadcast Center deal with the technical aspects
793600	798720	of taking the world feeds, of which as many as 64 are produced simultaneously in the case of Day 2
798720	803680	of the games, and disseminating these out to all the different rights-holding broadcasters around
803680	809680	the world. However, in addition to television production, much of the purpose of this facility
809680	814160	is to act as a workspace for all the journalists from around the world who have traveled to the
814160	820240	games. During the Olympics, one of OBS's main functions is essentially as a landlord—they
820240	825440	manage the International Broadcast Center and rent out space to different broadcasters to serve
825440	831520	as their workspaces. A private office in the center comes in units of 270 square feet or 25
831520	838240	square meters, and in the case of Tokyo, costs some $5,011 per unit for the duration of the games.
838800	845120	Of course, though, there are plenty of upcharges. Even once a broadcaster is paid to rent a space,
845120	851360	two normal wall plugs will cost them $876, and the OBS rate card even includes the option to
851360	857120	purchase a power strip for $27. Meanwhile, getting a dedicated 100 megabit per second
857120	863600	ethernet plug, to provide more stable internet than the free wifi, costs broadcasters $19,044.
864560	870320	OBS also sells broadcasters a digital data feed, giving real-time access to results, schedules,
870320	875680	medals, records, news, biographies, statistics, and more. This is what ultimately gets repackaged
875680	881920	into, for example, the real-time results you'll see on the NBC or the BBC websites. Finally,
881920	886480	OBS's rate card includes options to outfit a broadcaster's private office with a walkie-talkie
886480	895920	for $438, small folding table for $67, microwave for $105, and electric kettle for $23. With 6,000
895920	901200	accredited journalists awarded access to the Tokyo games, it's as much a job to manage them as the
901200	906320	athletes and, while procuring an electric kettle for an LA Times sportswriter might seem like a
906320	911920	trivial task, it makes the journalists' jobs easier, and doing so plays a tiny, but present
911920	917680	part in helping the Olympics run smoothly. Now, ultimately, while there are plenty of
917680	923040	big decisions required in planning the Olympics, there are few small ones. For the most part,
923040	928320	the host city's jobs are just to follow an incredibly detailed set of instructions.
928320	934000	They spend the better part of a decade doing exactly that, but the ultimate goal of the 2020
934000	940000	games is to make an event that's just as successful and runs largely the same as the games of 2016,
940000	946960	2012, 2008, or any year before. The goal is consistency, and therefore the task,
946960	952480	while enormous, is strictly prescribed. That doesn't mean it's straightforward, though—every
952480	957600	page of this document represents an incredible amount of work. A single line might become an
957600	962880	individual's job for years, and then actually putting that together, combining the tasks as
962880	968320	small as placing the right flag in a venue with those as large as building an entirely new stadium,
968320	972240	is what makes for a truly successful and impressive event.
973600	980800	As anyone knows by now, the 2020 Tokyo Olympic Games are actually happening in 2021. Of course,
980800	985840	taking one of the world's largest events and postponing it by a year mere months before,
985840	991600	after a decade of preparation, is an incredible feat. I didn't have time to cover that in this
991600	997760	video, but for those interested, I made a companion video about the subject and put it on Nebula.
997760	1002720	Nebula, of course, is always home to our normal videos early and ad-free, exclusive companion
