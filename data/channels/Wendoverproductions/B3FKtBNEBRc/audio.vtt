00:11.520 --> 00:17.440
Ten years ago, in May 2011, Adele's Rolling in the Deep was topping the Billboard charts,

00:17.440 --> 00:21.600
the first season of Game of Thrones was on its way to becoming a television phenomenon,

00:21.600 --> 00:26.560
Osama bin Laden had just been killed by US Navy Seals, and the International Olympic Committee

00:26.560 --> 00:30.800
was sending letters to national Olympic committees, soliciting bids to host the

00:30.800 --> 00:37.600
32nd running of the Summer Olympic Games. This moment marked the start of a decade-long process

00:37.600 --> 00:44.080
of planning and preparation, all leading up to a mere 16 days of international sporting competition.

00:44.640 --> 00:50.400
Step two was this. One month later, the governor of Tokyo, Japan announced his city's intention

00:50.400 --> 00:56.080
to submit a bid—in large part to mark their recovery from the massive 20,000 death earthquake

00:56.080 --> 01:02.080
that had devastated the country mere months before. Soon enough, Madrid, Istanbul, Baku,

01:02.080 --> 01:08.560
and Doha each submitted bids as well but, in the end, after a two-year evaluation process,

01:08.560 --> 01:13.360
a contract was signed between the International Olympic Committee, the Japanese Olympic Committee,

01:13.360 --> 01:20.640
and the city of Tokyo in September 2013. Tokyo would host the 2020 Summer Olympic Games.

01:21.280 --> 01:25.680
For an event of this scale, tens of thousands of athletes, millions of spectators,

01:25.680 --> 01:30.640
and billions of television viewers, a mere seven-year planning period, believe it or not,

01:30.640 --> 01:35.840
leaves no time to waste. The most watched television broadcast in existence needs to

01:35.840 --> 01:40.640
be planned, a whole village needs to be constructed, dozens of stadiums and venues

01:40.640 --> 01:45.520
need to be built, refurbished, or adapted, and one of the world's largest cities needs to plan

01:45.520 --> 01:52.320
for what might be the busiest three weeks of its existence. To complete this task, Tokyo was given

01:52.320 --> 01:59.040
this—the host city contract operational requirements document. Across its 273 pages,

01:59.040 --> 02:04.480
this outlines, in incredible detail, what the International Olympic Committee, or IOC,

02:04.480 --> 02:09.920
requires from its contractual partner, Tokyo, in order to complete the Olympics successfully and,

02:09.920 --> 02:16.640
crucially, consistently with all past and future games. It's essentially the Bible for Olympic

02:16.640 --> 02:23.600
organizers. The 2015 edition, made for the 2020 Games, now being held in 2021, outlines some

02:23.600 --> 02:29.440
absolutely minuscule details. For example, Tokyo had to install weather stations at the sites of

02:29.440 --> 02:34.080
all outdoor competition venues three years prior to the start of the Games in order to collect

02:34.080 --> 02:39.520
long-term data to be used by the IOC to inform their scheduling of events. The document also

02:39.520 --> 02:44.320
establishes some basic but far-reaching guidelines, such as the fact that the Olympics will last 16

02:44.320 --> 02:49.280
days, except for a certain number of preliminary competitions that, subject to IOC approval,

02:49.280 --> 02:54.240
can be held prior to the opening ceremony. It also, in a matter of mere paragraphs,

02:54.240 --> 03:01.600
outlines massive asks, such as the necessity for Tokyo to book 41,177 hotel rooms for the media,

03:01.600 --> 03:05.200
marketing partners, future host city representatives, IOC executives,

03:05.200 --> 03:09.040
National Olympic Committee representatives, International Sport Federation representatives,

03:09.040 --> 03:15.120
and more. This is equivalent to close to half of all of Tokyo's hotel rooms, and it only represents

03:15.120 --> 03:19.760
the accommodation requirements for those actually running the Games—not those competing or

03:19.760 --> 03:24.720
spectating. The hotel capacity crunch was such an issue, in fact, that prior to the prohibition

03:24.720 --> 03:29.120
of international spectators due to the coronavirus pandemic, the city had planned to dock cruise

03:29.120 --> 03:35.440
ships in Tokyo Bay to serve as additional, temporary hotels. Athletes, however, do not

03:35.440 --> 03:41.680
stay on hotels. Since the 1932 Los Angeles Games, each host city constructs a dedicated

03:41.680 --> 03:47.120
Olympics village to house athletes—far away from the crowds of fans and hordes of media.

03:47.120 --> 03:52.720
Now, the IOC's operational requirements set strict standards to assure that, for the most part,

03:52.720 --> 03:59.040
the 2012 village is just like the 2020 village, for all practical purposes. For example, it has

03:59.040 --> 04:04.800
to be within 50 kilometers, 31 miles, or a 60-minute drive of all venues, so if any event

04:04.880 --> 04:09.920
takes place further from the main host city, an additional village is constructed. This is

04:09.920 --> 04:14.240
especially relevant for the Winter Games, with which indoor sports often happen within the main

04:14.240 --> 04:19.600
host city, but outdoor events happen further away at mountain resorts. For example, in the case of

04:19.600 --> 04:24.800
the 2014 Games, a primary village was constructed in Sochi, while an additional one was set up at

04:24.800 --> 04:30.640
the Rosa Kutor Ski Resort where snow sports events took place. For the Summer Games in Tokyo, however,

04:30.640 --> 04:35.120
just one village was constructed, and the operational requirements dictated that it must

04:35.120 --> 04:41.280
have the capacity for 16,000 people, so it operates at the scale of a small town. The

04:41.280 --> 04:46.880
requirements also dictate that rooms must be at least 97 square feet or 9 meters in size,

04:46.880 --> 04:52.960
or 129 square feet or 12 meters with double rooms, and even outline the required contents.

04:53.600 --> 04:59.120
In addition, the village must have an Olympics merchandise store, a bank, photo store, hair salon,

04:59.120 --> 05:05.280
florist, dry cleaning shop, travel agent, post office, and more. Typically, McDonald's also sets

05:05.280 --> 05:09.920
up a temporary restaurant in the village for the games, which is like any McDonald's except that

05:09.920 --> 05:14.560
its menu has no prices—the company provides athletes with food for free in exchange for

05:14.560 --> 05:20.240
the publicity it inevitably attracts. Lastly, according to the operational requirements document,

05:20.240 --> 05:26.320
the village even must have a designated place of mourning. Now, constructing brand new dedicated

05:26.320 --> 05:33.200
venues, such as the village, for the purposes of a 16-day event, quite obviously presents problems.

05:33.200 --> 05:37.600
While in decades past cities were essentially willing to throw any amount of money at the games,

05:37.600 --> 05:42.160
and sometimes ram at hundreds of percents over budget, due to a belief that the publicity they

05:42.160 --> 05:47.680
attracted was invaluable, taxpayers, and therefore governments, are increasingly skeptical of the

05:47.680 --> 05:53.120
value that the games truly provides for a city and country. There are plenty of horror stories

05:53.200 --> 05:58.240
of places like Turin, Italy, the host of the 2006 games, whose village now sits derelict and is

05:58.240 --> 06:03.120
inhabited by squatters—essentially a complete waste of money from the perspective of the city,

06:03.120 --> 06:08.400
and therefore its taxpayers. There are also, however, cases like that of Sydney,

06:08.400 --> 06:13.840
which redeveloped its Olympics park into a true neighborhood. It's now home to upscale hotels,

06:13.840 --> 06:20.080
restaurants, and housing complexes, and hosts nearly 6,000 events both large and small each

06:20.080 --> 06:26.000
year. Altogether, having seen the horror stories, the Olympics are becoming less attractive for

06:26.000 --> 06:31.120
cities. In decades past, plenty of cities would bid to host each Olympics, but now there are

06:31.120 --> 06:36.720
situations like Paris 2024 or Los Angeles 2028 where cities are awarded the games effectively

06:36.720 --> 06:42.480
by default, having faced zero competition in the bidding process. For those that do host the games,

06:42.480 --> 06:46.880
though, cost consciousness has increased dramatically, and they're now trying to

06:46.880 --> 06:51.120
craft their venue strategy closer to that of Sydney rather than Turin.

06:51.840 --> 06:58.640
In Tokyo, three categories of Olympic venues are being used. The first is temporary. With

06:58.640 --> 07:03.680
certain events, such as canoeing, climbing, beach volleyball, or sailing, there's little prospect

07:03.680 --> 07:07.600
that the city can redevelop the venue into something self-sustaining after the games,

07:07.600 --> 07:11.520
so they either set up spectator and media facilities at existing sporting facilities

07:11.520 --> 07:16.640
that just lack the scale to host an Olympic event, or they set up an entirely new, temporary venue.

07:17.040 --> 07:20.720
For more popular sports that require less specialized facilities, however,

07:20.720 --> 07:25.680
Tokyo is using pre-existing venues around the city. For example, with table tennis,

07:25.680 --> 07:30.480
which requires little infrastructure, the Tokyo Metropolitan Gymnasium is being used,

07:30.480 --> 07:36.560
just as it was during the 1964 Tokyo Olympics for gymnastics. With certain events, however,

07:36.560 --> 07:42.960
the Tokyo organizers believed it was actually worth it to build a brand new venue. Swimming

07:42.960 --> 07:47.760
and diving events, for example, will happen at the brand new Olympics Aquatics Center.

07:47.760 --> 07:53.040
This is often the case at summer games. Swimming and diving are typically some of the most watched

07:53.040 --> 07:58.080
sports at the Olympics, despite mediocre popularity as a spectator sport outside the games.

07:58.080 --> 08:02.960
That means cities often lack aquatics venues with the scale necessary for Olympic events,

08:02.960 --> 08:08.400
so this is one of the venues more often built as new. At the 2016 Rio de Janeiro games,

08:08.400 --> 08:14.240
a temporary aquatic stadium was built, while at London 2012, Beijing 2008, Sydney 2000,

08:14.240 --> 08:20.800
and plenty more, new, permanent facilities were created. Now, with each of these new, permanent

08:20.800 --> 08:26.880
venues, the Bureau of Olympic and Paralympic Games Tokyo 2020 preparation had to justify

08:26.880 --> 08:33.200
their long-term value beyond the games to the government and public. Therefore, they released

08:33.200 --> 08:38.160
this document. It outlines the core of their development strategy—they want to create not

08:38.160 --> 08:42.160
only effective venues, but an appealing neighborhood, certainly following the model

08:42.160 --> 08:48.000
of Sydney 2000, so that they can consider any money spent an investment rather than a cost.

08:48.000 --> 08:52.560
With each of these new venues, such as the new Olympic Aquatics Center, for example,

08:52.560 --> 08:57.920
they've published a detailed post-games plan. Through redeveloping the venue into both a

08:57.920 --> 09:02.480
long-term competition venue and a community recreation center, the Bureau believes they

09:02.480 --> 09:06.720
can attract a million visitors per year after the games, and while they project the facility

09:06.720 --> 09:11.280
to run at a loss, it's one small enough to be comparable with other similar public recreation

09:11.280 --> 09:16.400
centers created outside of the context of the Olympics. Some of the other venues, such as the

09:16.400 --> 09:21.520
Ariake Arena, to be used for volleyball, are expected to turn a profit after the games,

09:21.520 --> 09:27.600
so altogether, if projections are accurate, these new venues won't be a long-term financial burden

09:27.600 --> 09:33.920
to the city and its taxpayers. Now, of course, like with anything regarding the Olympics,

09:33.920 --> 09:40.800
each of the 42 venues need to follow a sprawling set of strict standards. For example, they each

09:40.800 --> 09:45.280
need to have the Olympics flag and respective International Sporting Federation flag flying

09:45.280 --> 09:50.800
in a conspicuous spot. They need to have a full backup power system for all broadcast, media,

09:50.800 --> 09:56.000
technology, sport, and security operations, while their lighting systems must be split into two

09:56.000 --> 10:00.880
sections with independent power supplies for each so that events can go on even through power

10:00.880 --> 10:06.000
failure. In terms of the actual sporting facilities, however, these are each subject

10:06.000 --> 10:11.680
to the standards of the respective IOC-recognized International Sports Federation. For example,

10:11.680 --> 10:16.960
Olympic Rowing is managed by the International Rowing Federation, which recommends 531 feet or

10:16.960 --> 10:25.440
162 meters of course width, and requires 2,162 meters or 7,126 feet of length. Their standards

10:25.440 --> 10:30.400
get plenty more specific, though—they specify the intricacies of the course buoy system,

10:30.480 --> 10:35.360
outline where advertising banners can go, detail the location, construction, and operation of

10:35.360 --> 10:41.920
timing huts, and much, much more. Each Olympic event is essentially the pinnacle of its sport,

10:41.920 --> 10:49.360
so the International Federations are heavily involved. Of course, the Olympics are a made-for-television

10:49.360 --> 10:55.920
event. While millions of spectators do typically watch the games in person, billions watch on TV.

10:56.560 --> 11:03.120
In fact, 73% of the Olympics' total revenue comes from television rights alone—they simply would

11:03.120 --> 11:08.560
not happen in their modern form if not for their massive television audience, so perhaps the most

11:08.560 --> 11:14.960
important facility of all is this—the International Broadcast Center. In Tokyo,

11:14.960 --> 11:19.200
this facility is constructed in Tokyo Big Sight, the country's largest convention center,

11:19.200 --> 11:24.480
and is run by the Olympics Broadcasting Services, or OBS. Now, for the longest time,

11:24.480 --> 11:28.480
broadcasting operations were something that the International Olympic Committee would contract

11:28.480 --> 11:33.840
out to a third party, but in advance of the 2008 Beijing Olympics, OBS was established to act as

11:33.840 --> 11:39.920
the host broadcaster for all future games. Now, like with most large sporting events,

11:39.920 --> 11:45.280
you won't see cameras from NBC, BBC, Eurosport, and all the other national broadcasters that

11:45.280 --> 11:51.520
carry the events on TV actually at each event. That's because OBS is responsible for filming

11:51.520 --> 11:56.080
and producing each event, and then they provide produced feeds to each broadcaster,

11:56.080 --> 12:01.120
who acts as their customer. While NBC, for example, might have reporters and commentators

12:01.120 --> 12:07.040
at each event to augment the OBS feeds, they don't actually film the sporting events themselves.

12:07.760 --> 12:15.360
Now, OBS is a standalone, independent company set up by the IOC to fulfill these broadcast functions.

12:15.360 --> 12:21.840
While typically it has some 166 employees, this balloons up to 8,100 during the games,

12:21.840 --> 12:26.560
mostly comprised of the operational staff filming and producing the television feeds.

12:26.560 --> 12:33.360
Its ultimate task in Tokyo is to create 9,500 hours of content—more than with any prior

12:33.360 --> 12:41.120
Olympic Games. To accomplish this, it has deployed some 1,049 cameras and 3,600 microphones across

12:41.120 --> 12:47.040
Tokyo's 42 venues. These are cut together into produced world feeds in dedicated broadcast

12:47.040 --> 12:52.560
compounds at each venue, before being delivered to HERE—the International Broadcast Center.

12:52.560 --> 12:58.160
From one month before the games until its conclusion, this is a 24-7 operation and,

12:58.160 --> 13:03.200
much like the Olympics Village, operates like a small town, with restaurants, coffee shops,

13:03.200 --> 13:08.640
bars, a medical center, bank, convenience store, dry cleaners, and even a massage room.

13:08.640 --> 13:13.600
Many of OBS's facilities at the International Broadcast Center deal with the technical aspects

13:13.600 --> 13:18.720
of taking the world feeds, of which as many as 64 are produced simultaneously in the case of Day 2

13:18.720 --> 13:23.680
of the games, and disseminating these out to all the different rights-holding broadcasters around

13:23.680 --> 13:29.680
the world. However, in addition to television production, much of the purpose of this facility

13:29.680 --> 13:34.160
is to act as a workspace for all the journalists from around the world who have traveled to the

13:34.160 --> 13:40.240
games. During the Olympics, one of OBS's main functions is essentially as a landlord—they

13:40.240 --> 13:45.440
manage the International Broadcast Center and rent out space to different broadcasters to serve

13:45.440 --> 13:51.520
as their workspaces. A private office in the center comes in units of 270 square feet or 25

13:51.520 --> 13:58.240
square meters, and in the case of Tokyo, costs some $5,011 per unit for the duration of the games.

13:58.800 --> 14:05.120
Of course, though, there are plenty of upcharges. Even once a broadcaster is paid to rent a space,

14:05.120 --> 14:11.360
two normal wall plugs will cost them $876, and the OBS rate card even includes the option to

14:11.360 --> 14:17.120
purchase a power strip for $27. Meanwhile, getting a dedicated 100 megabit per second

14:17.120 --> 14:23.600
ethernet plug, to provide more stable internet than the free wifi, costs broadcasters $19,044.

14:24.560 --> 14:30.320
OBS also sells broadcasters a digital data feed, giving real-time access to results, schedules,

14:30.320 --> 14:35.680
medals, records, news, biographies, statistics, and more. This is what ultimately gets repackaged

14:35.680 --> 14:41.920
into, for example, the real-time results you'll see on the NBC or the BBC websites. Finally,

14:41.920 --> 14:46.480
OBS's rate card includes options to outfit a broadcaster's private office with a walkie-talkie

14:46.480 --> 14:55.920
for $438, small folding table for $67, microwave for $105, and electric kettle for $23. With 6,000

14:55.920 --> 15:01.200
accredited journalists awarded access to the Tokyo games, it's as much a job to manage them as the

15:01.200 --> 15:06.320
athletes and, while procuring an electric kettle for an LA Times sportswriter might seem like a

15:06.320 --> 15:11.920
trivial task, it makes the journalists' jobs easier, and doing so plays a tiny, but present

15:11.920 --> 15:17.680
part in helping the Olympics run smoothly. Now, ultimately, while there are plenty of

15:17.680 --> 15:23.040
big decisions required in planning the Olympics, there are few small ones. For the most part,

15:23.040 --> 15:28.320
the host city's jobs are just to follow an incredibly detailed set of instructions.

15:28.320 --> 15:34.000
They spend the better part of a decade doing exactly that, but the ultimate goal of the 2020

15:34.000 --> 15:40.000
games is to make an event that's just as successful and runs largely the same as the games of 2016,

15:40.000 --> 15:46.960
2012, 2008, or any year before. The goal is consistency, and therefore the task,

15:46.960 --> 15:52.480
while enormous, is strictly prescribed. That doesn't mean it's straightforward, though—every

15:52.480 --> 15:57.600
page of this document represents an incredible amount of work. A single line might become an

15:57.600 --> 16:02.880
individual's job for years, and then actually putting that together, combining the tasks as

16:02.880 --> 16:08.320
small as placing the right flag in a venue with those as large as building an entirely new stadium,

16:08.320 --> 16:12.240
is what makes for a truly successful and impressive event.

16:13.600 --> 16:20.800
As anyone knows by now, the 2020 Tokyo Olympic Games are actually happening in 2021. Of course,

16:20.800 --> 16:25.840
taking one of the world's largest events and postponing it by a year mere months before,

16:25.840 --> 16:31.600
after a decade of preparation, is an incredible feat. I didn't have time to cover that in this

16:31.600 --> 16:37.760
video, but for those interested, I made a companion video about the subject and put it on Nebula.

16:37.760 --> 16:42.720
Nebula, of course, is always home to our normal videos early and ad-free, exclusive companion

16:42.720 --> 16:47.600
videos such as this, and big-budget Nebula originals—and it's not only us, but also

16:47.600 --> 16:53.360
tons of your favorite educational creators such as Real Engineering, MKBHD, and Lindsay Ellis.

16:54.000 --> 16:59.760
Of course, what makes Nebula even better is the best way to get access to it—the CuriosityStream

16:59.760 --> 17:04.000
bundle deal. That's because CuriosityStream is home to an endless catalog of top-quality

17:04.080 --> 17:09.040
non-fiction shows and documentaries, such as The Tulip Bubble. This is a really well-made

17:09.040 --> 17:13.840
documentary about one of my favorite pieces of historical trivia—the time when tulip bulbs were

17:13.840 --> 17:18.480
sold quite literally for their weight in gold, and how the financial markets surrounding them

17:18.480 --> 17:24.320
demonstrated one of the first stories of boom and bust. So, you can get Nebula and CuriosityStream

17:24.320 --> 17:30.400
together, including tons of video content that you'll actually watch, for an unbelievable price—just

17:30.400 --> 17:36.080
$14.79 a year with the current sale at CuriosityStream.com slash Wendover.

17:36.080 --> 17:41.920
That truly has to be the best deal in streaming, and signing up helps support not only Wendover,

17:41.920 --> 17:50.640
but all these independent creators, so head to CuriosityStream.com slash Wendover.
