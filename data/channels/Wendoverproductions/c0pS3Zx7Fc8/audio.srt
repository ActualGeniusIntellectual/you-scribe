00:00:09,020 --> 00:00:14,100
A single aircraft carrier is enough to markedly change the level of a nation's military

4
00:00:14,100 --> 00:00:15,100
might.

5
00:00:15,100 --> 00:00:19,260
These ships are one of the strongest single assets a military can have.

6
00:00:19,260 --> 00:00:23,620
In general, under international law, aircraft carriers can legally position themselves up

7
00:00:23,620 --> 00:00:27,660
to 14 miles or 22 kilometers from any country's coast.

8
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:31,800
Clearly, the strategic influence of being able to place a military airbase just miles

9
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:36,380
from any coast in the world is enormous especially given that 80% of the world's population

10
00:00:36,380 --> 00:00:40,200
lives within 60 miles or 100 kilometers from the ocean.

11
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:44,840
While plenty of military vessels are capable of launching helicopters, there are just 19

12
00:00:44,840 --> 00:00:49,440
aircraft carriers worldwide currently in service capable of launching fixed-wing airplanes.

13
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:54,840
China, Thailand, India, Russia, and France each have one, Italy has two, and the US has

14
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:57,040
the 11 largest in the world.

15
00:00:57,040 --> 00:01:01,360
These largest carriers require over 6,000 people to operate and often stay deployed

16
00:01:01,360 --> 00:01:02,840
for up to a year.

17
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:05,360
They are fully fledged cities at sea.

18
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:08,920
The most advanced aircraft carriers like the French Navy's Charles de Gaulle are capable

19
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:11,640
of launching an aircraft every 30 seconds.

20
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:15,760
That means that, for a brief period, when launching aircraft at its maximum rate, the

21
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:20,920
aircraft carrier Charles de Gaulle becomes busier than Charles de Gaulle Airport in Paris.

22
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:24,960
To be able to achieve such a capability on a moving ship is no easy feat.

23
00:01:25,240 --> 00:01:29,200
While the operation of these vessels gives military's enormous strategic advantage,

24
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:32,920
they also represent one of their greatest operational challenges.

25
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:36,260
An aircraft carrier's offensive weapon is its aircraft.

26
00:01:36,260 --> 00:01:40,480
On board, carriers tend to only have a small number of defensive weapons such as surface

27
00:01:40,480 --> 00:01:42,480
to air missiles and machine guns.

28
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:47,240
But of course, just like any powerful military asset, these carriers are big targets.

29
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:51,200
It is for this reason that carriers never travel alone while on deployment.

30
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:54,800
While the exact composition can change depending on the mission, the carrier strike groups

31
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:58,680
American carriers travel with are typically made up of a guided-missile cruiser equipped

32
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:03,200
with tomahawk missiles, two guided-missile destroyers, an attack submarine, and a supply

33
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:04,200
ship.

34
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:07,840
An aircraft carrier is the flagship of this strike group meaning that, in its command

35
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:12,080
area, it not only has a bridge and an air traffic control center, it also has a flag

36
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:15,240
bridge where an admiral commands the entire strike group.

37
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:19,740
Each of the group's ships serves some combination of offensive and defensive roles.

38
00:02:19,740 --> 00:02:22,480
The only exception is the supply ship.

39
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:25,400
Most aircraft carriers don't need regular refueling.

40
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:29,740
All 11 American carriers and the French one are nuclear powered meaning they can sail

41
00:02:29,740 --> 00:02:33,240
an unlimited distance for 25 years without refueling.

42
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:37,260
Even conventionally powered aircraft carriers like the UK's HMS Queen Elizabeth can travel

43
00:02:37,260 --> 00:02:43,200
up to 12,000 miles or 18,000 kilometers without refueling making the need for stops infrequent.

44
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:47,060
While an American or French carrier could hypothetically sail non-stop for years or

45
00:02:47,060 --> 00:02:51,860
even decades, what they can't do is carry enough food, which is always needed, and aviation

46
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:56,140
fuel, which is needed for combat operations, to stay at sea for more than a few weeks at

47
00:02:56,140 --> 00:02:57,140
a time.

48
00:02:57,140 --> 00:03:00,740
It would be inefficient and place the carriers in a position of vulnerability to have to

49
00:03:00,740 --> 00:03:05,580
visit a port every few weeks to restock, especially during combat operations, so they don't.

50
00:03:05,580 --> 00:03:07,260
They restock while at sea.

51
00:03:07,260 --> 00:03:10,700
The supply ships that move as part of the strike group will sail off to a nearby port

52
00:03:10,700 --> 00:03:14,980
to take on fuel, ammunition, food, and mail, sail back to the strike group, then match

53
00:03:14,980 --> 00:03:17,500
speed and maneuver alongside the carrier.

54
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:20,260
From there, the two ships will shoot lines across to each other.

55
00:03:20,260 --> 00:03:24,120
These lines are used to pull hoses over to the carrier which are used to transfer aviation

56
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:25,120
fuel.

57
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:27,300
To transfer solid supplies, there are two methods.

58
00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:31,100
The first is attaching pallets to dollies that wheel cargo over to the carrier like

59
00:03:31,100 --> 00:03:32,100
a zipline.

60
00:03:32,100 --> 00:03:36,180
The second method, which is considered simpler yet more dangerous, is using helicopters to

61
00:03:36,180 --> 00:03:39,860
pick up pallets from the resupply ship and flying them over to the carrier.

62
00:03:39,860 --> 00:03:43,860
These transfers bring both crucial supplies like food and some less crucial items like

63
00:03:43,860 --> 00:03:48,340
mail, but this isn't the only way mail arrives on American aircraft carriers.

64
00:03:48,420 --> 00:03:52,300
Each carrier actually has a mailing address just like any building in the US.

65
00:03:52,300 --> 00:03:55,500
For example, this is the USS Gerald R. Ford's address.

66
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:58,900
Families of sailors can send mail to these addresses in the same way that they could

67
00:03:58,900 --> 00:04:04,220
to any other and, in fact, it costs the exact same as a shipment to any other US address,

68
00:04:04,220 --> 00:04:06,940
even if the ship is on the other side of the world.

69
00:04:06,940 --> 00:04:10,060
Sailors can even order packages online to their ship.

70
00:04:10,060 --> 00:04:14,100
Expedited mail often makes it from an address in the US to a carrier sailing somewhere around

71
00:04:14,100 --> 00:04:16,740
the world in just ten days.

72
00:04:16,740 --> 00:04:21,780
Using this speed requires more frequent deliveries than those of the logistic ships but conveniently,

73
00:04:21,780 --> 00:04:23,940
carriers are airports at sea.

74
00:04:23,940 --> 00:04:28,240
American carriers currently use a fleet of C-2 Greyhounds as cargo aircraft providing

75
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:32,400
a high-frequency, often daily connection between carriers and shore.

76
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:36,580
When cruising in the South China Sea, for example, as the USS Ronald Reagan did in November

77
00:04:36,580 --> 00:04:39,980
2018, mail might be sent to Singapore via conventional means.

78
00:04:39,980 --> 00:04:44,580
A C-2 Greyhound would then fly from the ship to Singapore, pick up the mail, and fly back

79
00:04:44,580 --> 00:04:45,580
to the ship.

80
00:04:45,580 --> 00:04:49,780
As carriers sail around the world, the pickup points of the C-2 Greyhounds are continuously

81
00:04:49,780 --> 00:04:52,260
shifted to nearby friendly nations.

82
00:04:52,260 --> 00:04:55,880
While mail does wonders for increasing crew morale, that's actually the lowest priority

83
00:04:55,880 --> 00:04:58,020
cargo for the C-2 Greyhounds.

84
00:04:58,020 --> 00:05:01,700
The aircraft are integral for bringing on spare parts for all the carrier's aircraft

85
00:05:01,700 --> 00:05:06,220
and transporting VIPs, press, and other individuals to and from the carriers.

86
00:05:06,220 --> 00:05:11,260
The C-2 Greyhound is about the same size as an Embraer 145—a civilian aircraft capable

87
00:05:11,260 --> 00:05:14,380
of carrying 50 people—so it's not tiny.

88
00:05:14,380 --> 00:05:18,100
The longest aircraft carrier in the world, which also happens to be the newest, is the

89
00:05:18,100 --> 00:05:24,220
USS Gerald R. Ford but even she is only 1,106 feet or 337 meters long.

90
00:05:24,220 --> 00:05:28,900
With commercial airports, a runway of 5,000 feet or 1,500 meters, like the one at London

91
00:05:28,900 --> 00:05:33,020
City Airport in London, is considered short while large airports like London Heathrow

92
00:05:33,020 --> 00:05:36,640
will have runways longer than 10,000 feet or 3,000 meters.

93
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:40,720
So how do C-2 Greyhounds and other aircraft on carriers deal with having runways of only

94
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:43,780
1,100 feet or 330 meters long?

95
00:05:43,780 --> 00:05:44,780
They don't.

96
00:05:44,780 --> 00:05:49,340
They take off with just 325 feet or 99 meters of space.

97
00:05:49,340 --> 00:05:53,900
All US and French carriers use a system of catapults to get aircraft up to takeoff speed

98
00:05:53,900 --> 00:05:55,780
within three to four seconds.

99
00:05:55,780 --> 00:06:00,120
This allows these carriers to launch a decently sized aircraft like the C-2 Greyhound with

100
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:02,220
their relatively short decks.

101
00:06:02,220 --> 00:06:06,220
Other carriers, like the Chinese and Indian ones, don't have catapults so they can only

102
00:06:06,220 --> 00:06:11,100
launch lighter, shorter range aircraft capable of taking off with a very short runway.

103
00:06:11,100 --> 00:06:15,100
Both these two types of carriers have arrestor wires that aircraft catch on landing to decelerate

104
00:06:15,100 --> 00:06:17,240
with a short distance given.

105
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:21,380
Every other aircraft carrier out there can only operate with aircraft capable of vertical

106
00:06:21,380 --> 00:06:22,380
landing.

107
00:06:22,380 --> 00:06:25,820
What takes place on the flight deck is carefully choreographed chaos.

108
00:06:25,820 --> 00:06:30,500
On American carriers, everyone's job is easily identifiable by the color shirt they

109
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:31,500
wear.

110
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:33,980
Yellow shirts deal with navigating aircraft around the deck.

111
00:06:33,980 --> 00:06:38,100
Blue shirts are assistance to yellow shirts driving tugs, operating elevators, delivering

112
00:06:38,100 --> 00:06:39,580
messages, and more.

113
00:06:39,580 --> 00:06:42,080
Red shirts do all the handling and mounting of ammunition.

114
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:44,020
Purple shirts manage aircraft fueling.

115
00:06:44,020 --> 00:06:48,280
Green shirts are worn by a few different groups including catapult crews, maintenance personnel,

116
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:49,700
cargo handlers, and more.

117
00:06:49,700 --> 00:06:53,660
White shirts are also worn by a mix of personnel including those helping aircraft land, working

118
00:06:53,660 --> 00:06:55,640
as medical personnel, and more.

119
00:06:55,640 --> 00:06:59,820
And lastly, brown shirts are worn by plane captains, who are not those that fly the aircraft,

120
00:06:59,820 --> 00:07:03,420
they are individually in charge of overseeing all work for getting an aircraft ready for

121
00:07:03,420 --> 00:07:04,420
flight.

122
00:07:04,420 --> 00:07:07,020
The flight deck is a dangerous place given its small size.

123
00:07:07,020 --> 00:07:11,320
It's so small that all the carrier's aircraft can't fit on it but of course just below

124
00:07:11,320 --> 00:07:12,980
the flight deck is the hangar.

125
00:07:12,980 --> 00:07:17,580
A large carrier can carry up to 100 aircraft so massive elevators bring aircraft from the

126
00:07:17,580 --> 00:07:21,020
flight deck to the hangar for storage when not in use.

127
00:07:21,020 --> 00:07:24,820
About 6,000 people work and live aboard each American carrier.

128
00:07:24,820 --> 00:07:28,220
3,200 of them have jobs related to running the ship itself.

129
00:07:28,220 --> 00:07:31,900
That includes everything from working in the engine room, maintaining the nuclear reactor,

130
00:07:31,900 --> 00:07:35,340
cleaning the decks, to actually working up in the bridge commanding the ship.

131
00:07:35,340 --> 00:07:39,260
Many of these jobs are below deck and, since all the above deck space is used for flight

132
00:07:39,260 --> 00:07:43,260
operations, many onboard can go weeks without seeing sunlight.

133
00:07:43,260 --> 00:07:46,580
2,500 other personnel are part of the carrier's air wing.

134
00:07:46,580 --> 00:07:50,540
If this was an airbase on land, these would be everyone working there including air traffic

135
00:07:50,540 --> 00:07:54,240
controllers, aircraft mechanics, fuelers, pilots, and more.

136
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:57,580
The few hundred remaining personnel work assorted other jobs.

137
00:07:57,580 --> 00:08:01,820
In terms of personal space, enlisted personnel, the vast majority of those onboard, only get

138
00:08:01,820 --> 00:08:05,340
a single bunk in a room with sometimes more than 100 others.

139
00:08:05,340 --> 00:08:09,180
Higher ranked individuals, though, of course have more spacious accommodations.

140
00:08:09,180 --> 00:08:13,500
As long-term homes for thousands of people, these ships also have a few small luxuries

141
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:18,500
like stores, gyms, barber shops, lounges, and more, but space is at a premium when 6,000

142
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:23,140
people are packed into one floating hall and the mission is paramount.

143
00:08:23,140 --> 00:08:26,980
Since their heyday in World War II, some have started to question the place aircraft carriers

144
00:08:26,980 --> 00:08:28,900
have in modern warfare.

145
00:08:28,980 --> 00:08:32,860
Every operating country aside from the US tend to, at any given moment, have their ships

146
00:08:32,860 --> 00:08:35,620
either in combat, in training, or at home.

147
00:08:35,620 --> 00:08:40,080
The US tends to use its carriers for a fourth function—power projection.

148
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:44,380
At any given moment, there is almost certainly an American carrier cruising somewhere in

149
00:08:44,380 --> 00:08:45,380
the world.

150
00:08:45,380 --> 00:08:50,020
In fact, January 2017 was the first time since World War II that there was not an American

151
00:08:50,020 --> 00:08:52,180
aircraft carrier on deployment.

152
00:08:52,180 --> 00:08:55,540
Even if there wasn't an aircraft carrier on deployment, they're fast.

153
00:08:55,900 --> 00:09:00,740
They have a top speed of 35 miles or 56 kilometers per hour meaning that a Norfolk, Virginia

154
00:09:00,740 --> 00:09:04,100
based carrier could get to the Middle East in just a week.

155
00:09:04,100 --> 00:09:08,420
In the Pacific, the US has an even greater advantage since it has the USS Ronald Reagan

156
00:09:08,420 --> 00:09:13,120
based in Yokosuka, Japan from where it could reach the shores of North Korea, for example,

157
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:15,460
in just 29 hours.

158
00:09:15,460 --> 00:09:18,980
American carriers spend plenty of time just cruising around the world's oceans reminding

159
00:09:18,980 --> 00:09:21,660
other countries of the US's military power.

160
00:09:21,660 --> 00:09:25,840
For example, the USS Ronald Reagan returned from a four-month deployment from August to

161
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:29,180
December 2018 during which it saw zero combat.

162
00:09:29,180 --> 00:09:33,340
It spent much of the time cruising around the South China Sea—an area in which China

163
00:09:33,340 --> 00:09:37,420
is attempting to assert military control, much to the US's displeasure.

164
00:09:37,420 --> 00:09:41,540
Elsewhere in Asia, American carriers also regularly make visits to the Korean peninsula

165
00:09:41,540 --> 00:09:43,980
to remind North Korea of their presence.

166
00:09:43,980 --> 00:09:48,540
This reached a peak in November 2017 as tensions with North Korea reached a peak when three

167
00:09:48,540 --> 00:09:51,800
American carriers loomed near Korean shores.

168
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:55,960
With their enormous power, though, aircraft carriers represent an enormous target especially

169
00:09:55,960 --> 00:09:58,880
in the era of stealthy drones and precise missiles.

170
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:03,140
The sinking of a single US aircraft carrier could result in more American military deaths

171
00:10:03,140 --> 00:10:07,740
than the entire Iraq war in addition to the loss of tens of billions of dollars in military

172
00:10:07,740 --> 00:10:08,740
assets.

173
00:10:08,740 --> 00:10:12,900
While no aircraft carrier of any nation has been sunk since World War II, it's potentially

174
00:10:12,900 --> 00:10:14,900
more possible than one would think.

175
00:10:14,900 --> 00:10:18,880
US carriers regularly participate in war games where combat conditions are simulated

176
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:19,880
with allies.

177
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:25,380
There have been two concerning incidents in 2005 and 2015 where Swedish and French submarines,

178
00:10:25,380 --> 00:10:28,500
respectively, have won the games against US carriers.

179
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:32,300
What this means is that the two-country submarines approach close enough to the carriers where

180
00:10:32,300 --> 00:10:36,380
they could have, if they were an enemy in real combat, launched torpedoes and potentially

181
00:10:36,380 --> 00:10:37,860
sank the carriers.

182
00:10:37,860 --> 00:10:42,820
This, in essence, proves that aircraft carriers, with all their defense, are not as unsinkable

183
00:10:42,820 --> 00:10:44,500
as some may say.

184
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:48,820
Meanwhile, the US has already received the first of ten in a new class of carriers while

185
00:10:48,820 --> 00:10:53,900
China, India, and the UK each have carriers under construction so, despite their possible

186
00:10:53,900 --> 00:10:58,100
obsolescence, we can be sure that the aircraft carrier won't be leaving the world's oceans

187
00:10:58,100 --> 00:11:00,180
any time soon.

188
00:11:00,180 --> 00:11:02,340
I have a logic question for you.

189
00:11:02,340 --> 00:11:06,040
Suppose there are two doors and the first has a sign on it saying, if this door is safe,

190
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:07,860
the other door is deadly.

191
00:11:07,860 --> 00:11:11,340
If that sign is false, what do you know about the doors?

192
00:11:11,340 --> 00:11:13,280
Which are deadly and which are safe?

193
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:17,980
Take a moment to think about it and, if you figure out the answer, leave it in the comments.

194
00:11:17,980 --> 00:11:22,000
