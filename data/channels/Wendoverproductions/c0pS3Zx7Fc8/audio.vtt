00:09.020 --> 00:14.100
A single aircraft carrier is enough to markedly change the level of a nation's military

00:14.100 --> 00:15.100
might.

00:15.100 --> 00:19.260
These ships are one of the strongest single assets a military can have.

00:19.260 --> 00:23.620
In general, under international law, aircraft carriers can legally position themselves up

00:23.620 --> 00:27.660
to 14 miles or 22 kilometers from any country's coast.

00:27.680 --> 00:31.800
Clearly, the strategic influence of being able to place a military airbase just miles

00:31.800 --> 00:36.380
from any coast in the world is enormous especially given that 80% of the world's population

00:36.380 --> 00:40.200
lives within 60 miles or 100 kilometers from the ocean.

00:40.200 --> 00:44.840
While plenty of military vessels are capable of launching helicopters, there are just 19

00:44.840 --> 00:49.440
aircraft carriers worldwide currently in service capable of launching fixed-wing airplanes.

00:49.440 --> 00:54.840
China, Thailand, India, Russia, and France each have one, Italy has two, and the US has

00:54.840 --> 00:57.040
the 11 largest in the world.

00:57.040 --> 01:01.360
These largest carriers require over 6,000 people to operate and often stay deployed

01:01.360 --> 01:02.840
for up to a year.

01:02.840 --> 01:05.360
They are fully fledged cities at sea.

01:05.360 --> 01:08.920
The most advanced aircraft carriers like the French Navy's Charles de Gaulle are capable

01:08.920 --> 01:11.640
of launching an aircraft every 30 seconds.

01:11.640 --> 01:15.760
That means that, for a brief period, when launching aircraft at its maximum rate, the

01:15.760 --> 01:20.920
aircraft carrier Charles de Gaulle becomes busier than Charles de Gaulle Airport in Paris.

01:20.920 --> 01:24.960
To be able to achieve such a capability on a moving ship is no easy feat.

01:25.240 --> 01:29.200
While the operation of these vessels gives military's enormous strategic advantage,

01:29.200 --> 01:32.920
they also represent one of their greatest operational challenges.

01:32.920 --> 01:36.260
An aircraft carrier's offensive weapon is its aircraft.

01:36.260 --> 01:40.480
On board, carriers tend to only have a small number of defensive weapons such as surface

01:40.480 --> 01:42.480
to air missiles and machine guns.

01:42.480 --> 01:47.240
But of course, just like any powerful military asset, these carriers are big targets.

01:47.240 --> 01:51.200
It is for this reason that carriers never travel alone while on deployment.

01:51.200 --> 01:54.800
While the exact composition can change depending on the mission, the carrier strike groups

01:54.800 --> 01:58.680
American carriers travel with are typically made up of a guided-missile cruiser equipped

01:58.680 --> 02:03.200
with tomahawk missiles, two guided-missile destroyers, an attack submarine, and a supply

02:03.200 --> 02:04.200
ship.

02:04.200 --> 02:07.840
An aircraft carrier is the flagship of this strike group meaning that, in its command

02:07.840 --> 02:12.080
area, it not only has a bridge and an air traffic control center, it also has a flag

02:12.080 --> 02:15.240
bridge where an admiral commands the entire strike group.

02:15.240 --> 02:19.740
Each of the group's ships serves some combination of offensive and defensive roles.

02:19.740 --> 02:22.480
The only exception is the supply ship.

02:22.480 --> 02:25.400
Most aircraft carriers don't need regular refueling.

02:25.400 --> 02:29.740
All 11 American carriers and the French one are nuclear powered meaning they can sail

02:29.740 --> 02:33.240
an unlimited distance for 25 years without refueling.

02:33.240 --> 02:37.260
Even conventionally powered aircraft carriers like the UK's HMS Queen Elizabeth can travel

02:37.260 --> 02:43.200
up to 12,000 miles or 18,000 kilometers without refueling making the need for stops infrequent.

02:43.200 --> 02:47.060
While an American or French carrier could hypothetically sail non-stop for years or

02:47.060 --> 02:51.860
even decades, what they can't do is carry enough food, which is always needed, and aviation

02:51.900 --> 02:56.140
fuel, which is needed for combat operations, to stay at sea for more than a few weeks at

02:56.140 --> 02:57.140
a time.

02:57.140 --> 03:00.740
It would be inefficient and place the carriers in a position of vulnerability to have to

03:00.740 --> 03:05.580
visit a port every few weeks to restock, especially during combat operations, so they don't.

03:05.580 --> 03:07.260
They restock while at sea.

03:07.260 --> 03:10.700
The supply ships that move as part of the strike group will sail off to a nearby port

03:10.700 --> 03:14.980
to take on fuel, ammunition, food, and mail, sail back to the strike group, then match

03:14.980 --> 03:17.500
speed and maneuver alongside the carrier.

03:17.500 --> 03:20.260
From there, the two ships will shoot lines across to each other.

03:20.260 --> 03:24.120
These lines are used to pull hoses over to the carrier which are used to transfer aviation

03:24.120 --> 03:25.120
fuel.

03:25.120 --> 03:27.300
To transfer solid supplies, there are two methods.

03:27.300 --> 03:31.100
The first is attaching pallets to dollies that wheel cargo over to the carrier like

03:31.100 --> 03:32.100
a zipline.

03:32.100 --> 03:36.180
The second method, which is considered simpler yet more dangerous, is using helicopters to

03:36.180 --> 03:39.860
pick up pallets from the resupply ship and flying them over to the carrier.

03:39.860 --> 03:43.860
These transfers bring both crucial supplies like food and some less crucial items like

03:43.860 --> 03:48.340
mail, but this isn't the only way mail arrives on American aircraft carriers.

03:48.420 --> 03:52.300
Each carrier actually has a mailing address just like any building in the US.

03:52.300 --> 03:55.500
For example, this is the USS Gerald R. Ford's address.

03:55.500 --> 03:58.900
Families of sailors can send mail to these addresses in the same way that they could

03:58.900 --> 04:04.220
to any other and, in fact, it costs the exact same as a shipment to any other US address,

04:04.220 --> 04:06.940
even if the ship is on the other side of the world.

04:06.940 --> 04:10.060
Sailors can even order packages online to their ship.

04:10.060 --> 04:14.100
Expedited mail often makes it from an address in the US to a carrier sailing somewhere around

04:14.100 --> 04:16.740
the world in just ten days.

04:16.740 --> 04:21.780
Using this speed requires more frequent deliveries than those of the logistic ships but conveniently,

04:21.780 --> 04:23.940
carriers are airports at sea.

04:23.940 --> 04:28.240
American carriers currently use a fleet of C-2 Greyhounds as cargo aircraft providing

04:28.240 --> 04:32.400
a high-frequency, often daily connection between carriers and shore.

04:32.400 --> 04:36.580
When cruising in the South China Sea, for example, as the USS Ronald Reagan did in November

04:36.580 --> 04:39.980
2018, mail might be sent to Singapore via conventional means.

04:39.980 --> 04:44.580
A C-2 Greyhound would then fly from the ship to Singapore, pick up the mail, and fly back

04:44.580 --> 04:45.580
to the ship.

04:45.580 --> 04:49.780
As carriers sail around the world, the pickup points of the C-2 Greyhounds are continuously

04:49.780 --> 04:52.260
shifted to nearby friendly nations.

04:52.260 --> 04:55.880
While mail does wonders for increasing crew morale, that's actually the lowest priority

04:55.880 --> 04:58.020
cargo for the C-2 Greyhounds.

04:58.020 --> 05:01.700
The aircraft are integral for bringing on spare parts for all the carrier's aircraft

05:01.700 --> 05:06.220
and transporting VIPs, press, and other individuals to and from the carriers.

05:06.220 --> 05:11.260
The C-2 Greyhound is about the same size as an Embraer 145—a civilian aircraft capable

05:11.260 --> 05:14.380
of carrying 50 people—so it's not tiny.

05:14.380 --> 05:18.100
The longest aircraft carrier in the world, which also happens to be the newest, is the

05:18.100 --> 05:24.220
USS Gerald R. Ford but even she is only 1,106 feet or 337 meters long.

05:24.220 --> 05:28.900
With commercial airports, a runway of 5,000 feet or 1,500 meters, like the one at London

05:28.900 --> 05:33.020
City Airport in London, is considered short while large airports like London Heathrow

05:33.020 --> 05:36.640
will have runways longer than 10,000 feet or 3,000 meters.

05:36.640 --> 05:40.720
So how do C-2 Greyhounds and other aircraft on carriers deal with having runways of only

05:40.720 --> 05:43.780
1,100 feet or 330 meters long?

05:43.780 --> 05:44.780
They don't.

05:44.780 --> 05:49.340
They take off with just 325 feet or 99 meters of space.

05:49.340 --> 05:53.900
All US and French carriers use a system of catapults to get aircraft up to takeoff speed

05:53.900 --> 05:55.780
within three to four seconds.

05:55.780 --> 06:00.120
This allows these carriers to launch a decently sized aircraft like the C-2 Greyhound with

06:00.120 --> 06:02.220
their relatively short decks.

06:02.220 --> 06:06.220
Other carriers, like the Chinese and Indian ones, don't have catapults so they can only

06:06.220 --> 06:11.100
launch lighter, shorter range aircraft capable of taking off with a very short runway.

06:11.100 --> 06:15.100
Both these two types of carriers have arrestor wires that aircraft catch on landing to decelerate

06:15.100 --> 06:17.240
with a short distance given.

06:17.240 --> 06:21.380
Every other aircraft carrier out there can only operate with aircraft capable of vertical

06:21.380 --> 06:22.380
landing.

06:22.380 --> 06:25.820
What takes place on the flight deck is carefully choreographed chaos.

06:25.820 --> 06:30.500
On American carriers, everyone's job is easily identifiable by the color shirt they

06:30.500 --> 06:31.500
wear.

06:31.500 --> 06:33.980
Yellow shirts deal with navigating aircraft around the deck.

06:33.980 --> 06:38.100
Blue shirts are assistance to yellow shirts driving tugs, operating elevators, delivering

06:38.100 --> 06:39.580
messages, and more.

06:39.580 --> 06:42.080
Red shirts do all the handling and mounting of ammunition.

06:42.080 --> 06:44.020
Purple shirts manage aircraft fueling.

06:44.020 --> 06:48.280
Green shirts are worn by a few different groups including catapult crews, maintenance personnel,

06:48.280 --> 06:49.700
cargo handlers, and more.

06:49.700 --> 06:53.660
White shirts are also worn by a mix of personnel including those helping aircraft land, working

06:53.660 --> 06:55.640
as medical personnel, and more.

06:55.640 --> 06:59.820
And lastly, brown shirts are worn by plane captains, who are not those that fly the aircraft,

06:59.820 --> 07:03.420
they are individually in charge of overseeing all work for getting an aircraft ready for

07:03.420 --> 07:04.420
flight.

07:04.420 --> 07:07.020
The flight deck is a dangerous place given its small size.

07:07.020 --> 07:11.320
It's so small that all the carrier's aircraft can't fit on it but of course just below

07:11.320 --> 07:12.980
the flight deck is the hangar.

07:12.980 --> 07:17.580
A large carrier can carry up to 100 aircraft so massive elevators bring aircraft from the

07:17.580 --> 07:21.020
flight deck to the hangar for storage when not in use.

07:21.020 --> 07:24.820
About 6,000 people work and live aboard each American carrier.

07:24.820 --> 07:28.220
3,200 of them have jobs related to running the ship itself.

07:28.220 --> 07:31.900
That includes everything from working in the engine room, maintaining the nuclear reactor,

07:31.900 --> 07:35.340
cleaning the decks, to actually working up in the bridge commanding the ship.

07:35.340 --> 07:39.260
Many of these jobs are below deck and, since all the above deck space is used for flight

07:39.260 --> 07:43.260
operations, many onboard can go weeks without seeing sunlight.

07:43.260 --> 07:46.580
2,500 other personnel are part of the carrier's air wing.

07:46.580 --> 07:50.540
If this was an airbase on land, these would be everyone working there including air traffic

07:50.540 --> 07:54.240
controllers, aircraft mechanics, fuelers, pilots, and more.

07:54.240 --> 07:57.580
The few hundred remaining personnel work assorted other jobs.

07:57.580 --> 08:01.820
In terms of personal space, enlisted personnel, the vast majority of those onboard, only get

08:01.820 --> 08:05.340
a single bunk in a room with sometimes more than 100 others.

08:05.340 --> 08:09.180
Higher ranked individuals, though, of course have more spacious accommodations.

08:09.180 --> 08:13.500
As long-term homes for thousands of people, these ships also have a few small luxuries

08:13.500 --> 08:18.500
like stores, gyms, barber shops, lounges, and more, but space is at a premium when 6,000

08:18.500 --> 08:23.140
people are packed into one floating hall and the mission is paramount.

08:23.140 --> 08:26.980
Since their heyday in World War II, some have started to question the place aircraft carriers

08:26.980 --> 08:28.900
have in modern warfare.

08:28.980 --> 08:32.860
Every operating country aside from the US tend to, at any given moment, have their ships

08:32.860 --> 08:35.620
either in combat, in training, or at home.

08:35.620 --> 08:40.080
The US tends to use its carriers for a fourth function—power projection.

08:40.080 --> 08:44.380
At any given moment, there is almost certainly an American carrier cruising somewhere in

08:44.380 --> 08:45.380
the world.

08:45.380 --> 08:50.020
In fact, January 2017 was the first time since World War II that there was not an American

08:50.020 --> 08:52.180
aircraft carrier on deployment.

08:52.180 --> 08:55.540
Even if there wasn't an aircraft carrier on deployment, they're fast.

08:55.900 --> 09:00.740
They have a top speed of 35 miles or 56 kilometers per hour meaning that a Norfolk, Virginia

09:00.740 --> 09:04.100
based carrier could get to the Middle East in just a week.

09:04.100 --> 09:08.420
In the Pacific, the US has an even greater advantage since it has the USS Ronald Reagan

09:08.420 --> 09:13.120
based in Yokosuka, Japan from where it could reach the shores of North Korea, for example,

09:13.120 --> 09:15.460
in just 29 hours.

09:15.460 --> 09:18.980
American carriers spend plenty of time just cruising around the world's oceans reminding

09:18.980 --> 09:21.660
other countries of the US's military power.

09:21.660 --> 09:25.840
For example, the USS Ronald Reagan returned from a four-month deployment from August to

09:25.840 --> 09:29.180
December 2018 during which it saw zero combat.

09:29.180 --> 09:33.340
It spent much of the time cruising around the South China Sea—an area in which China

09:33.340 --> 09:37.420
is attempting to assert military control, much to the US's displeasure.

09:37.420 --> 09:41.540
Elsewhere in Asia, American carriers also regularly make visits to the Korean peninsula

09:41.540 --> 09:43.980
to remind North Korea of their presence.

09:43.980 --> 09:48.540
This reached a peak in November 2017 as tensions with North Korea reached a peak when three

09:48.540 --> 09:51.800
American carriers loomed near Korean shores.

09:51.800 --> 09:55.960
With their enormous power, though, aircraft carriers represent an enormous target especially

09:55.960 --> 09:58.880
in the era of stealthy drones and precise missiles.

09:58.880 --> 10:03.140
The sinking of a single US aircraft carrier could result in more American military deaths

10:03.140 --> 10:07.740
than the entire Iraq war in addition to the loss of tens of billions of dollars in military

10:07.740 --> 10:08.740
assets.

10:08.740 --> 10:12.900
While no aircraft carrier of any nation has been sunk since World War II, it's potentially

10:12.900 --> 10:14.900
more possible than one would think.

10:14.900 --> 10:18.880
US carriers regularly participate in war games where combat conditions are simulated

10:18.880 --> 10:19.880
with allies.

10:19.880 --> 10:25.380
There have been two concerning incidents in 2005 and 2015 where Swedish and French submarines,

10:25.380 --> 10:28.500
respectively, have won the games against US carriers.

10:28.500 --> 10:32.300
What this means is that the two-country submarines approach close enough to the carriers where

10:32.300 --> 10:36.380
they could have, if they were an enemy in real combat, launched torpedoes and potentially

10:36.380 --> 10:37.860
sank the carriers.

10:37.860 --> 10:42.820
This, in essence, proves that aircraft carriers, with all their defense, are not as unsinkable

10:42.820 --> 10:44.500
as some may say.

10:44.500 --> 10:48.820
Meanwhile, the US has already received the first of ten in a new class of carriers while

10:48.820 --> 10:53.900
China, India, and the UK each have carriers under construction so, despite their possible

10:53.900 --> 10:58.100
obsolescence, we can be sure that the aircraft carrier won't be leaving the world's oceans

10:58.100 --> 11:00.180
any time soon.

11:00.180 --> 11:02.340
I have a logic question for you.

11:02.340 --> 11:06.040
Suppose there are two doors and the first has a sign on it saying, if this door is safe,

11:06.040 --> 11:07.860
the other door is deadly.

11:07.860 --> 11:11.340
If that sign is false, what do you know about the doors?

11:11.340 --> 11:13.280
Which are deadly and which are safe?

11:13.280 --> 11:17.980
Take a moment to think about it and, if you figure out the answer, leave it in the comments.

11:17.980 --> 11:22.000
This is a question from Brilliant.org's Logic Quiz which teaches you analytical skills

11:22.000 --> 11:23.240
