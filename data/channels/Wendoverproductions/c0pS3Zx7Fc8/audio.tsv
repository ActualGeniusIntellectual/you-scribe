9020	14100	A single aircraft carrier is enough to markedly change the level of a nation's military
14100	15100	might.
15100	19260	These ships are one of the strongest single assets a military can have.
19260	23620	In general, under international law, aircraft carriers can legally position themselves up
23620	27660	to 14 miles or 22 kilometers from any country's coast.
27680	31800	Clearly, the strategic influence of being able to place a military airbase just miles
31800	36380	from any coast in the world is enormous especially given that 80% of the world's population
36380	40200	lives within 60 miles or 100 kilometers from the ocean.
40200	44840	While plenty of military vessels are capable of launching helicopters, there are just 19
44840	49440	aircraft carriers worldwide currently in service capable of launching fixed-wing airplanes.
49440	54840	China, Thailand, India, Russia, and France each have one, Italy has two, and the US has
54840	57040	the 11 largest in the world.
57040	61360	These largest carriers require over 6,000 people to operate and often stay deployed
61360	62840	for up to a year.
62840	65360	They are fully fledged cities at sea.
65360	68920	The most advanced aircraft carriers like the French Navy's Charles de Gaulle are capable
68920	71640	of launching an aircraft every 30 seconds.
71640	75760	That means that, for a brief period, when launching aircraft at its maximum rate, the
75760	80920	aircraft carrier Charles de Gaulle becomes busier than Charles de Gaulle Airport in Paris.
80920	84960	To be able to achieve such a capability on a moving ship is no easy feat.
85240	89200	While the operation of these vessels gives military's enormous strategic advantage,
89200	92920	they also represent one of their greatest operational challenges.
92920	96260	An aircraft carrier's offensive weapon is its aircraft.
96260	100480	On board, carriers tend to only have a small number of defensive weapons such as surface
100480	102480	to air missiles and machine guns.
102480	107240	But of course, just like any powerful military asset, these carriers are big targets.
107240	111200	It is for this reason that carriers never travel alone while on deployment.
111200	114800	While the exact composition can change depending on the mission, the carrier strike groups
114800	118680	American carriers travel with are typically made up of a guided-missile cruiser equipped
118680	123200	with tomahawk missiles, two guided-missile destroyers, an attack submarine, and a supply
123200	124200	ship.
124200	127840	An aircraft carrier is the flagship of this strike group meaning that, in its command
127840	132080	area, it not only has a bridge and an air traffic control center, it also has a flag
132080	135240	bridge where an admiral commands the entire strike group.
135240	139740	Each of the group's ships serves some combination of offensive and defensive roles.
139740	142480	The only exception is the supply ship.
142480	145400	Most aircraft carriers don't need regular refueling.
145400	149740	All 11 American carriers and the French one are nuclear powered meaning they can sail
149740	153240	an unlimited distance for 25 years without refueling.
153240	157260	Even conventionally powered aircraft carriers like the UK's HMS Queen Elizabeth can travel
157260	163200	up to 12,000 miles or 18,000 kilometers without refueling making the need for stops infrequent.
163200	167060	While an American or French carrier could hypothetically sail non-stop for years or
167060	171860	even decades, what they can't do is carry enough food, which is always needed, and aviation
171900	176140	fuel, which is needed for combat operations, to stay at sea for more than a few weeks at
176140	177140	a time.
177140	180740	It would be inefficient and place the carriers in a position of vulnerability to have to
180740	185580	visit a port every few weeks to restock, especially during combat operations, so they don't.
185580	187260	They restock while at sea.
187260	190700	The supply ships that move as part of the strike group will sail off to a nearby port
190700	194980	to take on fuel, ammunition, food, and mail, sail back to the strike group, then match
194980	197500	speed and maneuver alongside the carrier.
197500	200260	From there, the two ships will shoot lines across to each other.
200260	204120	These lines are used to pull hoses over to the carrier which are used to transfer aviation
204120	205120	fuel.
205120	207300	To transfer solid supplies, there are two methods.
207300	211100	The first is attaching pallets to dollies that wheel cargo over to the carrier like
211100	212100	a zipline.
212100	216180	The second method, which is considered simpler yet more dangerous, is using helicopters to
216180	219860	pick up pallets from the resupply ship and flying them over to the carrier.
219860	223860	These transfers bring both crucial supplies like food and some less crucial items like
223860	228340	mail, but this isn't the only way mail arrives on American aircraft carriers.
228420	232300	Each carrier actually has a mailing address just like any building in the US.
232300	235500	For example, this is the USS Gerald R. Ford's address.
235500	238900	Families of sailors can send mail to these addresses in the same way that they could
238900	244220	to any other and, in fact, it costs the exact same as a shipment to any other US address,
244220	246940	even if the ship is on the other side of the world.
246940	250060	Sailors can even order packages online to their ship.
250060	254100	Expedited mail often makes it from an address in the US to a carrier sailing somewhere around
254100	256740	the world in just ten days.
256740	261780	Using this speed requires more frequent deliveries than those of the logistic ships but conveniently,
261780	263940	carriers are airports at sea.
263940	268240	American carriers currently use a fleet of C-2 Greyhounds as cargo aircraft providing
268240	272400	a high-frequency, often daily connection between carriers and shore.
272400	276580	When cruising in the South China Sea, for example, as the USS Ronald Reagan did in November
276580	279980	2018, mail might be sent to Singapore via conventional means.
279980	284580	A C-2 Greyhound would then fly from the ship to Singapore, pick up the mail, and fly back
284580	285580	to the ship.
285580	289780	As carriers sail around the world, the pickup points of the C-2 Greyhounds are continuously
289780	292260	shifted to nearby friendly nations.
292260	295880	While mail does wonders for increasing crew morale, that's actually the lowest priority
295880	298020	cargo for the C-2 Greyhounds.
298020	301700	The aircraft are integral for bringing on spare parts for all the carrier's aircraft
301700	306220	and transporting VIPs, press, and other individuals to and from the carriers.
306220	311260	The C-2 Greyhound is about the same size as an Embraer 145—a civilian aircraft capable
311260	314380	of carrying 50 people—so it's not tiny.
314380	318100	The longest aircraft carrier in the world, which also happens to be the newest, is the
318100	324220	USS Gerald R. Ford but even she is only 1,106 feet or 337 meters long.
324220	328900	With commercial airports, a runway of 5,000 feet or 1,500 meters, like the one at London
328900	333020	City Airport in London, is considered short while large airports like London Heathrow
333020	336640	will have runways longer than 10,000 feet or 3,000 meters.
336640	340720	So how do C-2 Greyhounds and other aircraft on carriers deal with having runways of only
340720	343780	1,100 feet or 330 meters long?
343780	344780	They don't.
344780	349340	They take off with just 325 feet or 99 meters of space.
349340	353900	All US and French carriers use a system of catapults to get aircraft up to takeoff speed
353900	355780	within three to four seconds.
355780	360120	This allows these carriers to launch a decently sized aircraft like the C-2 Greyhound with
360120	362220	their relatively short decks.
362220	366220	Other carriers, like the Chinese and Indian ones, don't have catapults so they can only
366220	371100	launch lighter, shorter range aircraft capable of taking off with a very short runway.
371100	375100	Both these two types of carriers have arrestor wires that aircraft catch on landing to decelerate
375100	377240	with a short distance given.
377240	381380	Every other aircraft carrier out there can only operate with aircraft capable of vertical
381380	382380	landing.
382380	385820	What takes place on the flight deck is carefully choreographed chaos.
385820	390500	On American carriers, everyone's job is easily identifiable by the color shirt they
390500	391500	wear.
391500	393980	Yellow shirts deal with navigating aircraft around the deck.
393980	398100	Blue shirts are assistance to yellow shirts driving tugs, operating elevators, delivering
398100	399580	messages, and more.
399580	402080	Red shirts do all the handling and mounting of ammunition.
402080	404020	Purple shirts manage aircraft fueling.
404020	408280	Green shirts are worn by a few different groups including catapult crews, maintenance personnel,
408280	409700	cargo handlers, and more.
409700	413660	White shirts are also worn by a mix of personnel including those helping aircraft land, working
413660	415640	as medical personnel, and more.
415640	419820	And lastly, brown shirts are worn by plane captains, who are not those that fly the aircraft,
419820	423420	they are individually in charge of overseeing all work for getting an aircraft ready for
423420	424420	flight.
424420	427020	The flight deck is a dangerous place given its small size.
427020	431320	It's so small that all the carrier's aircraft can't fit on it but of course just below
431320	432980	the flight deck is the hangar.
432980	437580	A large carrier can carry up to 100 aircraft so massive elevators bring aircraft from the
437580	441020	flight deck to the hangar for storage when not in use.
441020	444820	About 6,000 people work and live aboard each American carrier.
444820	448220	3,200 of them have jobs related to running the ship itself.
448220	451900	That includes everything from working in the engine room, maintaining the nuclear reactor,
451900	455340	cleaning the decks, to actually working up in the bridge commanding the ship.
455340	459260	Many of these jobs are below deck and, since all the above deck space is used for flight
459260	463260	operations, many onboard can go weeks without seeing sunlight.
463260	466580	2,500 other personnel are part of the carrier's air wing.
466580	470540	If this was an airbase on land, these would be everyone working there including air traffic
470540	474240	controllers, aircraft mechanics, fuelers, pilots, and more.
474240	477580	The few hundred remaining personnel work assorted other jobs.
477580	481820	In terms of personal space, enlisted personnel, the vast majority of those onboard, only get
481820	485340	a single bunk in a room with sometimes more than 100 others.
485340	489180	Higher ranked individuals, though, of course have more spacious accommodations.
489180	493500	As long-term homes for thousands of people, these ships also have a few small luxuries
493500	498500	like stores, gyms, barber shops, lounges, and more, but space is at a premium when 6,000
498500	503140	people are packed into one floating hall and the mission is paramount.
503140	506980	Since their heyday in World War II, some have started to question the place aircraft carriers
506980	508900	have in modern warfare.
508980	512860	Every operating country aside from the US tend to, at any given moment, have their ships
512860	515620	either in combat, in training, or at home.
515620	520080	The US tends to use its carriers for a fourth function—power projection.
520080	524380	At any given moment, there is almost certainly an American carrier cruising somewhere in
524380	525380	the world.
525380	530020	In fact, January 2017 was the first time since World War II that there was not an American
530020	532180	aircraft carrier on deployment.
532180	535540	Even if there wasn't an aircraft carrier on deployment, they're fast.
535900	540740	They have a top speed of 35 miles or 56 kilometers per hour meaning that a Norfolk, Virginia
540740	544100	based carrier could get to the Middle East in just a week.
544100	548420	In the Pacific, the US has an even greater advantage since it has the USS Ronald Reagan
548420	553120	based in Yokosuka, Japan from where it could reach the shores of North Korea, for example,
553120	555460	in just 29 hours.
555460	558980	American carriers spend plenty of time just cruising around the world's oceans reminding
558980	561660	other countries of the US's military power.
561660	565840	For example, the USS Ronald Reagan returned from a four-month deployment from August to
565840	569180	December 2018 during which it saw zero combat.
569180	573340	It spent much of the time cruising around the South China Sea—an area in which China
573340	577420	is attempting to assert military control, much to the US's displeasure.
577420	581540	Elsewhere in Asia, American carriers also regularly make visits to the Korean peninsula
581540	583980	to remind North Korea of their presence.
583980	588540	This reached a peak in November 2017 as tensions with North Korea reached a peak when three
588540	591800	American carriers loomed near Korean shores.
591800	595960	With their enormous power, though, aircraft carriers represent an enormous target especially
595960	598880	in the era of stealthy drones and precise missiles.
598880	603140	The sinking of a single US aircraft carrier could result in more American military deaths
603140	607740	than the entire Iraq war in addition to the loss of tens of billions of dollars in military
607740	608740	assets.
608740	612900	While no aircraft carrier of any nation has been sunk since World War II, it's potentially
612900	614900	more possible than one would think.
614900	618880	US carriers regularly participate in war games where combat conditions are simulated
618880	619880	with allies.
619880	625380	There have been two concerning incidents in 2005 and 2015 where Swedish and French submarines,
625380	628500	respectively, have won the games against US carriers.
628500	632300	What this means is that the two-country submarines approach close enough to the carriers where
632300	636380	they could have, if they were an enemy in real combat, launched torpedoes and potentially
636380	637860	sank the carriers.
637860	642820	This, in essence, proves that aircraft carriers, with all their defense, are not as unsinkable
642820	644500	as some may say.
644500	648820	Meanwhile, the US has already received the first of ten in a new class of carriers while
648820	653900	China, India, and the UK each have carriers under construction so, despite their possible
653900	658100	obsolescence, we can be sure that the aircraft carrier won't be leaving the world's oceans
658100	660180	any time soon.
660180	662340	I have a logic question for you.
662340	666040	Suppose there are two doors and the first has a sign on it saying, if this door is safe,
666040	667860	the other door is deadly.
667860	671340	If that sign is false, what do you know about the doors?
671340	673280	Which are deadly and which are safe?
673280	677980	Take a moment to think about it and, if you figure out the answer, leave it in the comments.
