0	6400	This is a Wendover Productions video in collaboration with real-life lore and made possible by LootCrate.
6400	7920	Is the European Union a country?
7920	12540	It's a bit of a strange question with an easy answer but a difficult explanation.
12540	17500	The answer is no, the European Union is not a country, but, you can move between countries
17500	22000	without passing through border control, work between countries without a visa, and they
22000	26180	use the same currency, and there are elections to a single parliament, and there's a single
26180	29360	government and there are official languages and a single economic market and a single
29360	33160	aviation market and this is beginning to sound awfully like a country.
33160	37500	Let's do a 90 second recap of how the EU works.
37500	38960	This is the European Union.
38960	43520	There are 28 member states including the UK which has voted to leave the EU but just hasn't
43520	45600	yet gone through the process to leave.
45600	49840	Of those, these are in the Schengen Zone meaning that there are no border controls between
49840	50840	them.
50840	54960	That means that a typical border crossing in the EU looks like this.
54960	58740	These four are legally obliged to be in the Schengen Zone but just aren't and these
58740	62660	two have opt-outs in their treaties that exempt them from being in the Schengen Zone.
62660	67380	These countries are part of the Eurozone meaning the euro is their sole legal currency.
67380	71820	These guys are obliged to join the Eurozone once they reach a certain economic target,
71820	75860	which they haven't, and these two have opt-outs exempting them from the Eurozone.
75860	79960	Each member country of the European Union elects its own members of the European Parliament,
79960	83740	known as MEPs, but the parliament can't make laws by itself.
83740	88140	Laws are proposed by the European Commission, who work kind of like an executive branch.
88140	91780	They then go to the parliament who, if they approve it, send it to the Council of the
91780	92780	European Union.
92780	97080	While the parliament represents the people of the European Union since the MEPs are elected
97080	101340	by direct election, the council represents the governments since it's made up of a
101340	103980	rotating roster of national ministers.
103980	107780	If a proposed piece of legislation makes it through both the parliament and the council
107780	110420	of Europe, it becomes law.
110420	115180	So that's how the European Union works, at least a massively simplified version.
115180	116780	But how do countries work?
116780	119540	Or rather, what makes a country a country?
119540	123900	Well, calling a country a country is a bit misleading because the word country can mean
123900	124900	a lot of things.
124900	128180	What you're probably thinking of when I say country is sovereign states—France,
128180	130660	Japan, the US, etc.
130660	133180	But there are non-sovereign states that are countries.
133180	137380	Scotland is a country—indisputably—but it's not a sovereign state.
137380	141020	It's part of the sovereign state of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern
141020	142020	Ireland.
142020	145020	So, once again, what makes a country a country?
145060	149980	Well, there's something called the declaratory theory of statehood that sets out four criteria
149980	151260	for statehood.
151260	153100	The first is a permanent population.
153100	157820	A country is not a country without people so it needs people in its territory permanently.
157820	162900	The EU easily has this—more than half a billion people live within its borders.
162900	166740	If it were a country, it would be the third most populous on earth and have one of the
166740	169200	highest GDPs in the world.
169200	171540	The second requirement is a defined territory.
172060	176860	It's a common misconception that a new country can only form on unclaimed territory.
176860	181400	According to the declaratory theory, a sovereign state can be created in an area where another
181400	183620	sovereign state already exists.
183620	185420	Just look at North and South Korea.
185420	188980	Both claim the territory of each other and yet they're both sovereign states.
188980	192820	The European Union has a territory, but it's a bit fuzzy.
192820	197980	Any territory that you can call EU territory is also territory of other entities—the
197980	199340	countries that make up the EU.
199340	202660	But that doesn't necessarily stop the EU from having a territory.
202660	207340	Going back to the example of the UK, the official sovereign state—the United Kingdom of Great
207340	211220	Britain and Northern Ireland—really doesn't have any of its own territory.
211220	216420	Any territory of the UK is part of England, Wales, Scotland, or Northern Ireland—each
216420	218020	countries by themselves.
218020	220360	The US is in a similar situation.
220360	223780	States act kind of like many countries and there's really no federal territory that
223780	226300	is not part of a state's territory.
226300	231260	Only given its open border policy, the EU territory is in function indistinguishable
231260	233600	from that of any sovereign state.
233600	237580	The third requirement is a government and the government can't be just a puppet of
237580	239300	another sovereign state.
239300	243400	The government needs to have what's called an essential core of independence.
243400	248380	As I've mentioned, the EU has a government, but for a few reasons, the EU government is
248380	250420	different from that of a sovereign state.
250420	251740	Here's the problem.
251740	254180	The EU's government is not independent.
254180	259060	The power comes from below, as in the power comes from the member states.
259060	263820	The power of sovereign states also comes from below, but in that case it's the people
263820	265260	that give a state power.
265260	270520	In the case of the EU, since power is granted by sovereign states, those states are really
270520	276380	above the EU in power and therefore the EU government is a subservient government.
276380	279920	That violates the criteria for a truly independent government.
279920	283900	Although what's the difference between this and the UK government then?
283900	285540	The country of countries.
285540	290580	The United Kingdom is also made up of countries so isn't their government subservient?
290580	295560	Well in the EU there's a system and structure to leaving, whereas in the United Kingdom,
295560	300040	or really any other country, the entities within the sovereign states cannot leave without
300040	303580	a change in government structure and procedure.
303580	308180	When parts of sovereign states leave sovereign states, they do so typically without a legal
308180	310540	right but rather a moral right.
310540	315020	It's called the right to revolution, according to the philosopher John Locke.
315020	319580	When a government no longer serves the people, as in, it fails to protect the right to the
319580	324540	people or becomes the entity that people need protection from, there is a near universal
324540	329900	moral understanding that the people can either overthrow or leave that government.
329900	334680	Members of the EU can choose whether or not to continue membership on a legal basis rather
334680	335960	than a moral one.
335960	340340	The whole structure and system was set up by the member states so even though it is
340340	344900	overseeing the states, the power originates from the states they oversee.
344900	350620	The continued existence of the EU relies on the will of its members to continue the system.
350620	353600	That is never the case with an independent government.
353600	357780	That being said, while the origin of power may be different, the EU government functions
357780	360260	in most ways like any other government.
360260	365140	It has different branches, agencies, economic systems, leaders, and more.
365140	370620	So while it's different, the EU does partially fulfill the government requirement for statehood.
370620	374720	The last criteria for statehood outlined in the declaratory theory is the capacity to
374720	379260	enter into relations with other states and the EU absolutely has this.
379260	384220	There are ambassadors to the EU, ambassadors of the EU, embassies of the EU, embassies
384220	389580	to the EU, intergovernmental organizations between the EU and non-EU countries, treaties
389580	392800	between the EU and non-EU countries, and more.
392800	396960	While most foreign relations are handled by individual member countries, there are
396960	400160	absolutely foreign relations of the EU as a whole.
400160	405080	So, the European Union has fulfilled each criteria for sovereign statehood on our list,
405080	407240	but it still isn't a state.
407240	408240	Here's the problem.
408240	413440	Statehood, as in being a sovereign country, is not a natural phenomenon.
413440	416280	No part of nature creates countries.
416280	419640	You can call salt salt if it's made of sodium chloride.
419640	423720	That's the requirement for salt being salt and we can't change that.
423720	426120	That's how nature makes salt.
426120	427760	We created the idea of countries.
427760	433680	They're a social construct so society decides what is a sovereign country and what is not.
433680	437760	While we can lay down a number of requisites for statehood, there are just guidelines to
437760	441900	achieve the final goal—society's acceptance of a country.
441900	446520	We can't just say these criteria make a country a country unless individuals believe
446520	451360	in those criteria since countries, like all social constructs, only work if there's
451360	454240	a collective belief and following of that system.
454240	456000	It's similar to money.
456000	460300	Money only works if everyone believes that pieces of paper equal value.
460300	465280	Countries only work if everyone believes that certain imaginary lines separate who and what
465280	466280	leads people.
466280	470720	In the case of statehood, you can't just ask every person in a society whether or not
470720	473180	they think a country is a sovereign country.
473180	478380	There are socially accepted countries already and therefore those act as a proxy for society
478380	481340	to decide whether a country is sovereign or not.
481340	485800	A country's sovereignty is judged off of how many other sovereign countries recognize
485800	486980	its sovereignty.
486980	491980	The European Union is not a sovereign state because nobody accepts it as one.
491980	497380	While it may function in many ways like a sovereign country, it is not one because sovereignty
497380	499920	is neither its goal or desire.
499920	503840	This shows you just how difficult it is to define what a country is.
503840	508200	Supernational organizations, like the EU, act like countries, but at the same time,
508200	514800	so do some subnational entities, as in parts of countries, most specifically in the US.
514800	518500	States have a level of sovereignty that blur the line between what is part of a sovereign
518500	520840	country and a country itself.
520840	524000	What is the difference between a state in the United States and a country?
524000	527920	They fulfill almost all of the criteria that you just heard about so that's why I asked
527920	532160	the question in collaboration with Wendover Productions, is the United States a country,
