00:00.000 --> 00:06.400
This is a Wendover Productions video in collaboration with real-life lore and made possible by LootCrate.

00:06.400 --> 00:07.920
Is the European Union a country?

00:07.920 --> 00:12.540
It's a bit of a strange question with an easy answer but a difficult explanation.

00:12.540 --> 00:17.500
The answer is no, the European Union is not a country, but, you can move between countries

00:17.500 --> 00:22.000
without passing through border control, work between countries without a visa, and they

00:22.000 --> 00:26.180
use the same currency, and there are elections to a single parliament, and there's a single

00:26.180 --> 00:29.360
government and there are official languages and a single economic market and a single

00:29.360 --> 00:33.160
aviation market and this is beginning to sound awfully like a country.

00:33.160 --> 00:37.500
Let's do a 90 second recap of how the EU works.

00:37.500 --> 00:38.960
This is the European Union.

00:38.960 --> 00:43.520
There are 28 member states including the UK which has voted to leave the EU but just hasn't

00:43.520 --> 00:45.600
yet gone through the process to leave.

00:45.600 --> 00:49.840
Of those, these are in the Schengen Zone meaning that there are no border controls between

00:49.840 --> 00:50.840
them.

00:50.840 --> 00:54.960
That means that a typical border crossing in the EU looks like this.

00:54.960 --> 00:58.740
These four are legally obliged to be in the Schengen Zone but just aren't and these

00:58.740 --> 01:02.660
two have opt-outs in their treaties that exempt them from being in the Schengen Zone.

01:02.660 --> 01:07.380
These countries are part of the Eurozone meaning the euro is their sole legal currency.

01:07.380 --> 01:11.820
These guys are obliged to join the Eurozone once they reach a certain economic target,

01:11.820 --> 01:15.860
which they haven't, and these two have opt-outs exempting them from the Eurozone.

01:15.860 --> 01:19.960
Each member country of the European Union elects its own members of the European Parliament,

01:19.960 --> 01:23.740
known as MEPs, but the parliament can't make laws by itself.

01:23.740 --> 01:28.140
Laws are proposed by the European Commission, who work kind of like an executive branch.

01:28.140 --> 01:31.780
They then go to the parliament who, if they approve it, send it to the Council of the

01:31.780 --> 01:32.780
European Union.

01:32.780 --> 01:37.080
While the parliament represents the people of the European Union since the MEPs are elected

01:37.080 --> 01:41.340
by direct election, the council represents the governments since it's made up of a

01:41.340 --> 01:43.980
rotating roster of national ministers.

01:43.980 --> 01:47.780
If a proposed piece of legislation makes it through both the parliament and the council

01:47.780 --> 01:50.420
of Europe, it becomes law.

01:50.420 --> 01:55.180
So that's how the European Union works, at least a massively simplified version.

01:55.180 --> 01:56.780
But how do countries work?

01:56.780 --> 01:59.540
Or rather, what makes a country a country?

01:59.540 --> 02:03.900
Well, calling a country a country is a bit misleading because the word country can mean

02:03.900 --> 02:04.900
a lot of things.

02:04.900 --> 02:08.180
What you're probably thinking of when I say country is sovereign states—France,

02:08.180 --> 02:10.660
Japan, the US, etc.

02:10.660 --> 02:13.180
But there are non-sovereign states that are countries.

02:13.180 --> 02:17.380
Scotland is a country—indisputably—but it's not a sovereign state.

02:17.380 --> 02:21.020
It's part of the sovereign state of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern

02:21.020 --> 02:22.020
Ireland.

02:22.020 --> 02:25.020
So, once again, what makes a country a country?

02:25.060 --> 02:29.980
Well, there's something called the declaratory theory of statehood that sets out four criteria

02:29.980 --> 02:31.260
for statehood.

02:31.260 --> 02:33.100
The first is a permanent population.

02:33.100 --> 02:37.820
A country is not a country without people so it needs people in its territory permanently.

02:37.820 --> 02:42.900
The EU easily has this—more than half a billion people live within its borders.

02:42.900 --> 02:46.740
If it were a country, it would be the third most populous on earth and have one of the

02:46.740 --> 02:49.200
highest GDPs in the world.

02:49.200 --> 02:51.540
The second requirement is a defined territory.

02:52.060 --> 02:56.860
It's a common misconception that a new country can only form on unclaimed territory.

02:56.860 --> 03:01.400
According to the declaratory theory, a sovereign state can be created in an area where another

03:01.400 --> 03:03.620
sovereign state already exists.

03:03.620 --> 03:05.420
Just look at North and South Korea.

03:05.420 --> 03:08.980
Both claim the territory of each other and yet they're both sovereign states.

03:08.980 --> 03:12.820
The European Union has a territory, but it's a bit fuzzy.

03:12.820 --> 03:17.980
Any territory that you can call EU territory is also territory of other entities—the

03:17.980 --> 03:19.340
countries that make up the EU.

03:19.340 --> 03:22.660
But that doesn't necessarily stop the EU from having a territory.

03:22.660 --> 03:27.340
Going back to the example of the UK, the official sovereign state—the United Kingdom of Great

03:27.340 --> 03:31.220
Britain and Northern Ireland—really doesn't have any of its own territory.

03:31.220 --> 03:36.420
Any territory of the UK is part of England, Wales, Scotland, or Northern Ireland—each

03:36.420 --> 03:38.020
countries by themselves.

03:38.020 --> 03:40.360
The US is in a similar situation.

03:40.360 --> 03:43.780
States act kind of like many countries and there's really no federal territory that

03:43.780 --> 03:46.300
is not part of a state's territory.

03:46.300 --> 03:51.260
Only given its open border policy, the EU territory is in function indistinguishable

03:51.260 --> 03:53.600
from that of any sovereign state.

03:53.600 --> 03:57.580
The third requirement is a government and the government can't be just a puppet of

03:57.580 --> 03:59.300
another sovereign state.

03:59.300 --> 04:03.400
The government needs to have what's called an essential core of independence.

04:03.400 --> 04:08.380
As I've mentioned, the EU has a government, but for a few reasons, the EU government is

04:08.380 --> 04:10.420
different from that of a sovereign state.

04:10.420 --> 04:11.740
Here's the problem.

04:11.740 --> 04:14.180
The EU's government is not independent.

04:14.180 --> 04:19.060
The power comes from below, as in the power comes from the member states.

04:19.060 --> 04:23.820
The power of sovereign states also comes from below, but in that case it's the people

04:23.820 --> 04:25.260
that give a state power.

04:25.260 --> 04:30.520
In the case of the EU, since power is granted by sovereign states, those states are really

04:30.520 --> 04:36.380
above the EU in power and therefore the EU government is a subservient government.

04:36.380 --> 04:39.920
That violates the criteria for a truly independent government.

04:39.920 --> 04:43.900
Although what's the difference between this and the UK government then?

04:43.900 --> 04:45.540
The country of countries.

04:45.540 --> 04:50.580
The United Kingdom is also made up of countries so isn't their government subservient?

04:50.580 --> 04:55.560
Well in the EU there's a system and structure to leaving, whereas in the United Kingdom,

04:55.560 --> 05:00.040
or really any other country, the entities within the sovereign states cannot leave without

05:00.040 --> 05:03.580
a change in government structure and procedure.

05:03.580 --> 05:08.180
When parts of sovereign states leave sovereign states, they do so typically without a legal

05:08.180 --> 05:10.540
right but rather a moral right.

05:10.540 --> 05:15.020
It's called the right to revolution, according to the philosopher John Locke.

05:15.020 --> 05:19.580
When a government no longer serves the people, as in, it fails to protect the right to the

05:19.580 --> 05:24.540
people or becomes the entity that people need protection from, there is a near universal

05:24.540 --> 05:29.900
moral understanding that the people can either overthrow or leave that government.

05:29.900 --> 05:34.680
Members of the EU can choose whether or not to continue membership on a legal basis rather

05:34.680 --> 05:35.960
than a moral one.

05:35.960 --> 05:40.340
The whole structure and system was set up by the member states so even though it is

05:40.340 --> 05:44.900
overseeing the states, the power originates from the states they oversee.

05:44.900 --> 05:50.620
The continued existence of the EU relies on the will of its members to continue the system.

05:50.620 --> 05:53.600
That is never the case with an independent government.

05:53.600 --> 05:57.780
That being said, while the origin of power may be different, the EU government functions

05:57.780 --> 06:00.260
in most ways like any other government.

06:00.260 --> 06:05.140
It has different branches, agencies, economic systems, leaders, and more.

06:05.140 --> 06:10.620
So while it's different, the EU does partially fulfill the government requirement for statehood.

06:10.620 --> 06:14.720
The last criteria for statehood outlined in the declaratory theory is the capacity to

06:14.720 --> 06:19.260
enter into relations with other states and the EU absolutely has this.

06:19.260 --> 06:24.220
There are ambassadors to the EU, ambassadors of the EU, embassies of the EU, embassies

06:24.220 --> 06:29.580
to the EU, intergovernmental organizations between the EU and non-EU countries, treaties

06:29.580 --> 06:32.800
between the EU and non-EU countries, and more.

06:32.800 --> 06:36.960
While most foreign relations are handled by individual member countries, there are

06:36.960 --> 06:40.160
absolutely foreign relations of the EU as a whole.

06:40.160 --> 06:45.080
So, the European Union has fulfilled each criteria for sovereign statehood on our list,

06:45.080 --> 06:47.240
but it still isn't a state.

06:47.240 --> 06:48.240
Here's the problem.

06:48.240 --> 06:53.440
Statehood, as in being a sovereign country, is not a natural phenomenon.

06:53.440 --> 06:56.280
No part of nature creates countries.

06:56.280 --> 06:59.640
You can call salt salt if it's made of sodium chloride.

06:59.640 --> 07:03.720
That's the requirement for salt being salt and we can't change that.

07:03.720 --> 07:06.120
That's how nature makes salt.

07:06.120 --> 07:07.760
We created the idea of countries.

07:07.760 --> 07:13.680
They're a social construct so society decides what is a sovereign country and what is not.

07:13.680 --> 07:17.760
While we can lay down a number of requisites for statehood, there are just guidelines to

07:17.760 --> 07:21.900
achieve the final goal—society's acceptance of a country.

07:21.900 --> 07:26.520
We can't just say these criteria make a country a country unless individuals believe

07:26.520 --> 07:31.360
in those criteria since countries, like all social constructs, only work if there's

07:31.360 --> 07:34.240
a collective belief and following of that system.

07:34.240 --> 07:36.000
It's similar to money.

07:36.000 --> 07:40.300
Money only works if everyone believes that pieces of paper equal value.

07:40.300 --> 07:45.280
Countries only work if everyone believes that certain imaginary lines separate who and what

07:45.280 --> 07:46.280
leads people.

07:46.280 --> 07:50.720
In the case of statehood, you can't just ask every person in a society whether or not

07:50.720 --> 07:53.180
they think a country is a sovereign country.

07:53.180 --> 07:58.380
There are socially accepted countries already and therefore those act as a proxy for society

07:58.380 --> 08:01.340
to decide whether a country is sovereign or not.

08:01.340 --> 08:05.800
A country's sovereignty is judged off of how many other sovereign countries recognize

08:05.800 --> 08:06.980
its sovereignty.

08:06.980 --> 08:11.980
The European Union is not a sovereign state because nobody accepts it as one.

08:11.980 --> 08:17.380
While it may function in many ways like a sovereign country, it is not one because sovereignty

08:17.380 --> 08:19.920
is neither its goal or desire.

08:19.920 --> 08:23.840
This shows you just how difficult it is to define what a country is.

08:23.840 --> 08:28.200
Supernational organizations, like the EU, act like countries, but at the same time,

08:28.200 --> 08:34.800
so do some subnational entities, as in parts of countries, most specifically in the US.

08:34.800 --> 08:38.500
States have a level of sovereignty that blur the line between what is part of a sovereign

08:38.500 --> 08:40.840
country and a country itself.

08:40.840 --> 08:44.000
What is the difference between a state in the United States and a country?

08:44.000 --> 08:47.920
They fulfill almost all of the criteria that you just heard about so that's why I asked

08:47.920 --> 08:52.160
the question in collaboration with Wendover Productions, is the United States a country,
