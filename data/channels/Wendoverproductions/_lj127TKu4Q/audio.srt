This is a Wendover Productions video in collaboration with real-life lore and made possible by LootCrate.

2
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:07,920
Is the European Union a country?

3
00:00:07,920 --> 00:00:12,540
It's a bit of a strange question with an easy answer but a difficult explanation.

4
00:00:12,540 --> 00:00:17,500
The answer is no, the European Union is not a country, but, you can move between countries

5
00:00:17,500 --> 00:00:22,000
without passing through border control, work between countries without a visa, and they

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,180
use the same currency, and there are elections to a single parliament, and there's a single

7
00:00:26,180 --> 00:00:29,360
government and there are official languages and a single economic market and a single

8
00:00:29,360 --> 00:00:33,160
aviation market and this is beginning to sound awfully like a country.

9
00:00:33,160 --> 00:00:37,500
Let's do a 90 second recap of how the EU works.

10
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:38,960
This is the European Union.

11
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:43,520
There are 28 member states including the UK which has voted to leave the EU but just hasn't

12
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:45,600
yet gone through the process to leave.

13
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:49,840
Of those, these are in the Schengen Zone meaning that there are no border controls between

14
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:50,840
them.

15
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:54,960
That means that a typical border crossing in the EU looks like this.

16
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:58,740
These four are legally obliged to be in the Schengen Zone but just aren't and these

17
00:00:58,740 --> 00:01:02,660
two have opt-outs in their treaties that exempt them from being in the Schengen Zone.

18
00:01:02,660 --> 00:01:07,380
These countries are part of the Eurozone meaning the euro is their sole legal currency.

19
00:01:07,380 --> 00:01:11,820
These guys are obliged to join the Eurozone once they reach a certain economic target,

20
00:01:11,820 --> 00:01:15,860
which they haven't, and these two have opt-outs exempting them from the Eurozone.

21
00:01:15,860 --> 00:01:19,960
Each member country of the European Union elects its own members of the European Parliament,

22
00:01:19,960 --> 00:01:23,740
known as MEPs, but the parliament can't make laws by itself.

23
00:01:23,740 --> 00:01:28,140
Laws are proposed by the European Commission, who work kind of like an executive branch.

24
00:01:28,140 --> 00:01:31,780
They then go to the parliament who, if they approve it, send it to the Council of the

25
00:01:31,780 --> 00:01:32,780
European Union.

26
00:01:32,780 --> 00:01:37,080
While the parliament represents the people of the European Union since the MEPs are elected

27
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:41,340
by direct election, the council represents the governments since it's made up of a

28
00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:43,980
rotating roster of national ministers.

29
00:01:43,980 --> 00:01:47,780
If a proposed piece of legislation makes it through both the parliament and the council

30
00:01:47,780 --> 00:01:50,420
of Europe, it becomes law.

31
00:01:50,420 --> 00:01:55,180
So that's how the European Union works, at least a massively simplified version.

32
00:01:55,180 --> 00:01:56,780
But how do countries work?

33
00:01:56,780 --> 00:01:59,540
Or rather, what makes a country a country?

34
00:01:59,540 --> 00:02:03,900
Well, calling a country a country is a bit misleading because the word country can mean

35
00:02:03,900 --> 00:02:04,900
a lot of things.

36
00:02:04,900 --> 00:02:08,180
What you're probably thinking of when I say country is sovereign states—France,

37
00:02:08,180 --> 00:02:10,660
Japan, the US, etc.

38
00:02:10,660 --> 00:02:13,180
But there are non-sovereign states that are countries.

39
00:02:13,180 --> 00:02:17,380
Scotland is a country—indisputably—but it's not a sovereign state.

40
00:02:17,380 --> 00:02:21,020
It's part of the sovereign state of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern

41
00:02:21,020 --> 00:02:22,020
Ireland.

42
00:02:22,020 --> 00:02:25,020
So, once again, what makes a country a country?

43
00:02:25,060 --> 00:02:29,980
Well, there's something called the declaratory theory of statehood that sets out four criteria

44
00:02:29,980 --> 00:02:31,260
for statehood.

45
00:02:31,260 --> 00:02:33,100
The first is a permanent population.

46
00:02:33,100 --> 00:02:37,820
A country is not a country without people so it needs people in its territory permanently.

47
00:02:37,820 --> 00:02:42,900
The EU easily has this—more than half a billion people live within its borders.

48
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:46,740
If it were a country, it would be the third most populous on earth and have one of the

49
00:02:46,740 --> 00:02:49,200
highest GDPs in the world.

50
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:51,540
The second requirement is a defined territory.

51
00:02:52,060 --> 00:02:56,860
It's a common misconception that a new country can only form on unclaimed territory.

52
00:02:56,860 --> 00:03:01,400
According to the declaratory theory, a sovereign state can be created in an area where another

53
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:03,620
sovereign state already exists.

54
00:03:03,620 --> 00:03:05,420
Just look at North and South Korea.

55
00:03:05,420 --> 00:03:08,980
Both claim the territory of each other and yet they're both sovereign states.

56
00:03:08,980 --> 00:03:12,820
The European Union has a territory, but it's a bit fuzzy.

57
00:03:12,820 --> 00:03:17,980
Any territory that you can call EU territory is also territory of other entities—the

58
00:03:17,980 --> 00:03:19,340
countries that make up the EU.

59
00:03:19,340 --> 00:03:22,660
But that doesn't necessarily stop the EU from having a territory.

60
00:03:22,660 --> 00:03:27,340
Going back to the example of the UK, the official sovereign state—the United Kingdom of Great

61
00:03:27,340 --> 00:03:31,220
Britain and Northern Ireland—really doesn't have any of its own territory.

62
00:03:31,220 --> 00:03:36,420
Any territory of the UK is part of England, Wales, Scotland, or Northern Ireland—each

63
00:03:36,420 --> 00:03:38,020
countries by themselves.

64
00:03:38,020 --> 00:03:40,360
The US is in a similar situation.

65
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:43,780
States act kind of like many countries and there's really no federal territory that

66
00:03:43,780 --> 00:03:46,300
is not part of a state's territory.

67
00:03:46,300 --> 00:03:51,260
Only given its open border policy, the EU territory is in function indistinguishable

68
00:03:51,260 --> 00:03:53,600
from that of any sovereign state.

69
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:57,580
The third requirement is a government and the government can't be just a puppet of

70
00:03:57,580 --> 00:03:59,300
another sovereign state.

71
00:03:59,300 --> 00:04:03,400
The government needs to have what's called an essential core of independence.

72
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:08,380
As I've mentioned, the EU has a government, but for a few reasons, the EU government is

73
00:04:08,380 --> 00:04:10,420
different from that of a sovereign state.

74
00:04:10,420 --> 00:04:11,740
Here's the problem.

75
00:04:11,740 --> 00:04:14,180
The EU's government is not independent.

76
00:04:14,180 --> 00:04:19,060
The power comes from below, as in the power comes from the member states.

77
00:04:19,060 --> 00:04:23,820
The power of sovereign states also comes from below, but in that case it's the people

78
00:04:23,820 --> 00:04:25,260
that give a state power.

79
00:04:25,260 --> 00:04:30,520
In the case of the EU, since power is granted by sovereign states, those states are really

80
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:36,380
above the EU in power and therefore the EU government is a subservient government.

81
00:04:36,380 --> 00:04:39,920
That violates the criteria for a truly independent government.

82
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:43,900
Although what's the difference between this and the UK government then?

83
00:04:43,900 --> 00:04:45,540
The country of countries.

84
00:04:45,540 --> 00:04:50,580
The United Kingdom is also made up of countries so isn't their government subservient?

85
00:04:50,580 --> 00:04:55,560
Well in the EU there's a system and structure to leaving, whereas in the United Kingdom,

86
00:04:55,560 --> 00:05:00,040
or really any other country, the entities within the sovereign states cannot leave without

87
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:03,580
a change in government structure and procedure.

88
00:05:03,580 --> 00:05:08,180
When parts of sovereign states leave sovereign states, they do so typically without a legal

89
00:05:08,180 --> 00:05:10,540
right but rather a moral right.

90
00:05:10,540 --> 00:05:15,020
It's called the right to revolution, according to the philosopher John Locke.

91
00:05:15,020 --> 00:05:19,580
When a government no longer serves the people, as in, it fails to protect the right to the

92
00:05:19,580 --> 00:05:24,540
people or becomes the entity that people need protection from, there is a near universal

93
00:05:24,540 --> 00:05:29,900
moral understanding that the people can either overthrow or leave that government.

94
00:05:29,900 --> 00:05:34,680
Members of the EU can choose whether or not to continue membership on a legal basis rather

95
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:35,960
than a moral one.

96
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:40,340
The whole structure and system was set up by the member states so even though it is

97
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:44,900
overseeing the states, the power originates from the states they oversee.

98
00:05:44,900 --> 00:05:50,620
The continued existence of the EU relies on the will of its members to continue the system.

99
00:05:50,620 --> 00:05:53,600
That is never the case with an independent government.

100
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:57,780
That being said, while the origin of power may be different, the EU government functions

101
00:05:57,780 --> 00:06:00,260
in most ways like any other government.

102
00:06:00,260 --> 00:06:05,140
It has different branches, agencies, economic systems, leaders, and more.

103
00:06:05,140 --> 00:06:10,620
So while it's different, the EU does partially fulfill the government requirement for statehood.

104
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:14,720
The last criteria for statehood outlined in the declaratory theory is the capacity to

105
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:19,260
enter into relations with other states and the EU absolutely has this.

106
00:06:19,260 --> 00:06:24,220
There are ambassadors to the EU, ambassadors of the EU, embassies of the EU, embassies

107
00:06:24,220 --> 00:06:29,580
to the EU, intergovernmental organizations between the EU and non-EU countries, treaties

108
00:06:29,580 --> 00:06:32,800
between the EU and non-EU countries, and more.

109
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:36,960
While most foreign relations are handled by individual member countries, there are

110
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:40,160
absolutely foreign relations of the EU as a whole.

111
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:45,080
So, the European Union has fulfilled each criteria for sovereign statehood on our list,

112
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:47,240
but it still isn't a state.

113
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:48,240
Here's the problem.

114
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:53,440
Statehood, as in being a sovereign country, is not a natural phenomenon.

115
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:56,280
No part of nature creates countries.

116
00:06:56,280 --> 00:06:59,640
You can call salt salt if it's made of sodium chloride.

117
00:06:59,640 --> 00:07:03,720
That's the requirement for salt being salt and we can't change that.

118
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:06,120
That's how nature makes salt.

119
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:07,760
We created the idea of countries.

120
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:13,680
They're a social construct so society decides what is a sovereign country and what is not.

121
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:17,760
While we can lay down a number of requisites for statehood, there are just guidelines to

122
00:07:17,760 --> 00:07:21,900
achieve the final goal—society's acceptance of a country.

123
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:26,520
We can't just say these criteria make a country a country unless individuals believe

124
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:31,360
in those criteria since countries, like all social constructs, only work if there's

125
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:34,240
a collective belief and following of that system.

126
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:36,000
It's similar to money.

127
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:40,300
Money only works if everyone believes that pieces of paper equal value.

128
00:07:40,300 --> 00:07:45,280
Countries only work if everyone believes that certain imaginary lines separate who and what

129
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:46,280
leads people.

130
00:07:46,280 --> 00:07:50,720
In the case of statehood, you can't just ask every person in a society whether or not

131
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:53,180
they think a country is a sovereign country.

132
00:07:53,180 --> 00:07:58,380
There are socially accepted countries already and therefore those act as a proxy for society

133
00:07:58,380 --> 00:08:01,340
to decide whether a country is sovereign or not.

134
00:08:01,340 --> 00:08:05,800
A country's sovereignty is judged off of how many other sovereign countries recognize

135
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:06,980
its sovereignty.

136
00:08:06,980 --> 00:08:11,980
The European Union is not a sovereign state because nobody accepts it as one.

137
00:08:11,980 --> 00:08:17,380
While it may function in many ways like a sovereign country, it is not one because sovereignty

138
00:08:17,380 --> 00:08:19,920
is neither its goal or desire.

139
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:23,840
This shows you just how difficult it is to define what a country is.

140
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:28,200
Supernational organizations, like the EU, act like countries, but at the same time,

141
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:34,800
so do some subnational entities, as in parts of countries, most specifically in the US.

142
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:38,500
States have a level of sovereignty that blur the line between what is part of a sovereign

143
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:40,840
country and a country itself.

144
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:44,000
What is the difference between a state in the United States and a country?

145
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:47,920
They fulfill almost all of the criteria that you just heard about so that's why I asked

146
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:52,160

funds go right back into the channel.

166
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:06,280
I even release expense reports at the end of each month.

letters, and most recently, t-shirts.

169
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:17,920
You can also order a t-shirt by itself for only $20 through DFTBA.
