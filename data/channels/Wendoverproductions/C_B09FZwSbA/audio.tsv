0	3240	This is the disaster scenario.
3240	4960	It's Black Friday.
4960	9920	An electronics store has acquired a massive supply of scarce 9th generation game consoles,
9920	14720	and to generate buzz, they're selling them at a massive discount—offering buyers an
14720	18880	immediate arbitrage opportunity if they sell the devices on.
18880	23540	With a three-per-person limit, people can effectively earn hundreds of dollars just
23540	25480	by standing in line.
25480	27400	But there's not really a line.
27880	32040	Rather, it's more of a mass, filling out the width of the pedestrian mall, growing
32040	35320	and growing in advance of its 9am opening time.
35320	39920	The contracted security only arrives at 8am—they're able to push through to the entrance and get
39920	43480	on a megaphone to say, we need you to form an orderly line.
43480	47880	There are only 500 consoles, we will not be able to accommodate everyone, so we need you
47880	50600	to form an orderly line this way.
50600	52880	The crowd does not comply.
52880	57380	The minutes count down, and upon opening time, the security team decides to carefully let
57380	61560	small groups in from the front of the crowd, assuring that the store and its staff does
61560	63760	not get stormed.
63760	67500	Fast forward 30 minutes, and this will lead to a crowd crush.
67500	71840	It's entirely predictable—the back of the crowd, concerned about the fast dwindling
71840	76460	supply of consoles, will each individually, almost subconsciously push forward.
76460	80440	The core of the crowd will get compacted down, individuals will no longer have the ability
80440	85760	to move freely, and an unlucky few will get asphyxiated—they quite literally will get
85760	90140	crushed so hard that they're unable to adequately breathe.
90140	94800	Their closest way out is into the store, leading to a further push forward, but the security,
94800	98480	tasked with keeping the mass out of the store, will brush off the police for entry as an
98480	101640	inevitable dynamic of a greedy, disorderly crowd.
101640	105960	That's to say, each of these three groups have different incentives—the back of the
105960	109680	crowd to get the consoles, the security to keep the crowd out, and the core of the crowd
109680	115960	to simply survive, but they'll all lead to the same result—an ever-escalating crush.
115960	121080	But the absolute, overwhelming majority of crowds do not end up crushing themselves,
121080	125360	so what is it about this rather innocuous, all-too-believable situation that makes it
125360	127480	so theoretically dangerous?
127480	130280	Well, it starts with who the people are.
130280	134360	You see, there's an antiquated view that mass gatherings of people almost inevitably
134360	139480	devolve into a mindless state—that the participation in the collective dehumanizes the individual
139480	143780	and makes them more willing to act in a disruptive, dangerous way, but more recent research has
143780	145600	started to dispel that notion.
145600	149440	Interestingly, in the exact situation where you'd expect people to disengage from the
149440	154440	collective good, panic, and work selfishly, in emergencies, people tend to do the exact
154440	155860	opposite.
155860	159080	If a fire were to start in an overcrowded building, you might expect people to rush
159080	163040	the exits, to mindlessly push those in front just to get away from the threat, but that
163040	165620	happens remarkably rarely.
165620	170320	Of the 21 major crowd crushes to have occurred so far this decade, just two involve people
170320	174640	running away from a deadly threat—one in Yemen spurred by an electrical explosion,
174640	178240	and one in Egypt where worshippers fled to escape a church fire.
178240	181220	This is entirely counterintuitive.
181220	185380	Running away from a fire is clearly a stronger incentive than gaining the right to buy a
185380	190580	console, so researchers were curious as to why the frequency of crushes was so much lower
190580	193900	in the direction with lower incentive.
193900	198100	Consider a common anecdote—on a normal flight, people barely talk.
198100	202500	They'll sit shoulder to shoulder with their fellow traveler for four or five hours without
202500	208220	even acknowledging their presence once, but as soon as a flight gets delayed, that changes.
208220	212620	People start talking, they start problem solving, they get friendly, they'll even share food.
212620	216400	If the flight gets cancelled, this cooperation often extends further, and those that were
216400	220260	complete strangers just minutes before might decide to work together and share a rental
220260	223320	car to drive to their destination instead.
223340	227680	Some psychologists have noticed the pervasiveness of this anecdote, and they think they have
227680	228680	an explanation.
228680	231560	It's all about identity.
231560	235140	When ambling around the airport, there is little shared identity beyond traveler, which
235140	240160	is weak since it is shared by so many, but when a flight gets delayed, the identity shifts
240160	241160	and concentrates.
241160	247320	Now, it's distressed traveler—a unique identity shared only by the unlucky few.
247320	251660	What researchers have found is that the greater the degree of shared identity, the greater
251660	253860	the degree of cooperation among a crowd.
253860	258540	They're even able to test this—for example, in a simulated evacuation of a London Underground
258540	262340	station, study participants were more likely to help a distressed person if that person
262340	266220	was wearing the jersey of a football team the participant was a fan of.
266220	269840	Conveniently, most events involve a shared identity.
269840	274340	People amass as fans of a team, followers of a religion, protesters for a cause—there
274340	279020	is almost always a shared identity that justifies the assembly, which helps to keep order even
279020	281740	when tens or hundreds of thousands of people gather.
281740	287000	And this can help to explain the infrequency of evacuation-based crushes—on a normal
287000	291380	day in the London Underground, the mass' only shared identity is commuter.
291380	293780	But then there's an explosion.
293780	299260	In that moment, identity immediately concentrates and strengthens—now everyone is a victim
299260	301900	of the same rare disaster.
301900	306400	In the 2005 London Underground bombings, researchers interviewing victims observed a through-line
306400	310600	of perceived unity among the victims in the moment, and countless examples of selfless,
310600	313880	cooperative behavior even at the risk of personal peril.
313880	319720	This is observed in almost any disaster—there is always a high degree of crowd cooperation,
319720	324040	far beyond what might often be portrayed in fiction, that typically leads to rather orderly,
324040	326200	crush-free evacuations.
326200	330480	But another curious anomaly in crowd-crush statistics is that it is quite rare for them
330480	336420	to occur during civil unrest—during the very activity that defines mob mentality.
336420	341040	The only major crush to occur during a riot this decade was 2022's Kanjurahan Stadium
341040	345520	disaster in Indonesia, but that was caused by a mass of field-invading football fans
345520	349720	fleeing from police-fired tear gas—not the riot itself.
349720	354280	The last major riot-related crush before that was also caused by police intervention during
354280	356720	2016 protests in Ethiopia.
356720	361160	As rare as it is to find a crush during a riot, it is yet rarer to find one where police
361160	363600	intervention is not the cause.
363600	368780	This is strange—according to traditional theories, people lose their sense of self
368780	373200	during such activities, they act savagely, feeding off the energy of the masses, and
373200	378620	yet somehow, the very crowd in which one would expect the highest degree of disorder is able
378620	384640	to avoid the worst better than the football or concert or ritual-going masses.
384640	389880	An explanation comes from the inverse—the annual Hajj pilgrimage, one of the world's
389880	393620	largest events where more than two million Muslims descend on Mecca to visit the spiritual
393620	396480	center of the world's second-largest religion.
396480	400880	This is exactly the kind of event where one would expect to see high crowd cooperativeness—after
400880	406020	all, compounding the strong shared identities of Muslim and pilgrim, all two or three million
406020	410320	are expected to be in a state of iran, or ritualistic purity of the body and mind to
410320	414020	the extent that they're not even allowed to break branches from trees, and yet, this
414060	420180	pilgrimage was home to both the 20th and 21st century's most deadly, crowd-crushed tragedies,
420180	424180	each counting, well, over a thousand dead.
424180	427540	Considering the history, researchers have long used the Hajj as a source of study of
427540	433420	crowd psychology, and one important conclusion came from the very center of the Muslim world—the
433420	434420	Kaaba.
434420	438820	This stone structure is said to be the House of Allah, the single holiest site in Islam,
438820	442500	so one of the most significant elements of the Hajj is prayer in the Grand Mosque of
442500	444440	Mecca facing the Kaaba.
444440	448740	There are two main areas in which one can do this—the circular plaza, directly surrounding
448740	451540	the Kaaba, or on the balconies above.
451540	455780	The plaza is probably the best spot since it has an unobstructed view of the Kaaba,
455780	459740	whereas the balconies have these pillars that obstruct the view for some.
459740	463620	Researchers questioned how this might impact that all-important crowd cooperativeness,
463620	467200	and therefore surveyed more than a thousand pilgrims to find out.
467200	471580	As they expected, the balconies—the area where there is a more variable experience,
471580	476660	and experience improved by how much one pushes and shoves to get that best spot—saw a lower
476660	478420	degree of crowd cooperativeness.
478420	484640	That's to say, as competitiveness goes up, cooperativeness goes down.
484640	489540	In riots, though, there is little competitiveness—there is not a particular something to be gained
489540	493380	or lost, and therefore there is little incentive to push and shove.
493380	498220	Not only that, but there is typically a strong shared identity—before tensions escalated,
498220	501860	a group of people gathered together in support of a particular cause.
501860	507260	Therefore, riots feature two of the strongest predictors of lowered crowd-crush potential,
507260	511500	explaining how some of the least organized events managed to avoid the worst.
511500	516500	Meanwhile, there's a particular situation at far more organized events that time and
516500	518580	time again has led to the worst.
518580	522240	A group of people have spent a good bit of money buying tickets and a good bit of time
522240	526860	getting to a stadium to watch a concert, or a sporting match, or something, but with massive
526860	532300	crowds and limited entry throughput, the event is starting, and they're still outside.
532300	537300	This exact competitive dynamic led to a 2023 crowd-crush in San Salvador, El Salvador,
537300	544260	a 2022 crush in Yaounde, Cameroon, a 2019 one in Antananarivo, Madagascar, 2017 in Luange,
544260	549720	Malawi, 2017 in Uengue, Angola—it is perhaps the most predictable crush scenario that still
549720	550720	occurs.
550720	554460	But you don't need to look for examples in developing countries for this particular
554460	557820	situation—just look at concerts.
557820	562700	What makes a good concert, according to most, is also what makes it dangerous, and that's
562700	563700	unassigned seating.
563700	568700	In a festival setting, unassigned seating is the norm, as seats of any sort are a rarity,
568700	572940	and VIP tickets, as opposed to general admission tickets, often only provide benefits in the
572940	576300	form of easier access and a less dense crowd.
576300	580540	In tighter indoor and enclosed facilities, from small local venues to massive arenas
580540	585220	and stadiums, there's often a split in ticket options—seated tickets and floor
585220	586220	tickets.
586220	589540	While seated tickets are easier on organizers and crowd experts, they're seen by concert
589540	595540	goers and touring bands alike as boring, overly clinical, just low-energy, lifeless experiences.
595540	600420	Because of this, bands and band fans insist on unassigned floor seating, where energy
600420	603520	is high and crowd interaction is more dynamic.
603520	607540	And yet, despite all its appeal to everyone but the organizers, general admission seating
607540	614020	in the city of Cincinnati was entirely banned from 1979 to 2004.
614020	619240	The 24 and a half year ban dates back to a Who concert on December 3, 1979.
619240	624860	A much-anticipated show, and one that easily sold out the 18,348 unassigned seats available
624860	629300	at Cincinnati's Riverfront Stadium, the concert was supposed to be a celebration,
629300	634340	not a watershed moment in crowd control and live event policy the world over.
634340	639100	Of course, in any unassigned seating environment, there's inherent competition—for the best
639100	641760	view, people push their way to the front.
641760	645740	In this particular situation, this competition only compounded.
645740	649380	In order to get in the best position to push their way to the front, thousands had lined
649380	651380	up outside the venue.
651380	655580	Afternoon then gave way to evening, the crowd grew cold waiting, and once the venue finally
655580	659780	opened, those at the front were surprised to see only two meager doors swing wide to
659780	662900	welcome nearly 20,000.
662900	666940	When patience grew, and tensions rose across the crowd with the delay in entry.
666940	672340	Then, at the sound of a late soundcheck confused as the beginning of the concert, the dam broke.
672340	675940	The push began from the back, far outside the venue, but the compounding pressure was
675940	680100	felt at the front, where people poured through the two open doors with scratches, torn shirt,
680100	683860	and without shoes while others ripped at the countless other doors still closed, not to
683860	687460	cut in line, but to release the building pressure.
687460	694500	At the entrance, the crowd collapsed, then it crushed, leaving 11 dead and dozens injured.
694500	699280	In the tragedy's wake, much was made of the character of those involved—their motives,
699280	703740	the substances they had taken, and the rock and roll culture that they had ascribed to.
703740	708020	This much, in the aftermath of crowd-related tragedies, is a recurrent theme.
708020	712160	At sporting matches, it's hooliganism, at concerts and festivals, it's youth culture,
712160	714580	at religious events, it's fanaticism.
714700	718340	At that base, it's all bad design.
718340	723020	What blaming a selfish, crazed crowd doesn't account for is the disconnect between overmatched
723020	727060	and understaffed security ushering nearly 20,000 people through only two doors.
727060	730820	It doesn't account for people rushing those doors, not to get the best spot, but to find
730820	731820	enough room to breathe.
731820	735420	It doesn't account for those at the back shuffling forward, not out of ill will, but
735420	739260	a lack of understanding as to the pressure they're exerting on the front.
739260	742940	Blaming the crowd also fails to account for the fact that once crowd density begins to
742940	747640	reach dangerous levels, individual agency goes out the window.
747640	752060	In fact, at crowd densities that reach higher than 5 people per square meter, a mark that's
752060	756460	considered high-risk for fall and trampling, individuals lose the ability to control their
756460	761000	own movement and are instead at the whim of shockwaves rippling through the crowd.
761000	765740	At this point, the principles defining crowd movement are closer to fluid dynamics than
765740	766740	anything else.
766740	771220	It was the culmination of such factors—the disconnect between security, the front of
771220	774620	the crowd, and the back of the crowd—along with inability once caught in the crush to
774620	778880	do anything but move with the shockwaves, that ultimately informed what's now known
778880	783060	as the WHO disaster—factors that were out of the crowd's control, and factors that
783060	786580	stemmed from a poorly prepared venue and overmatched staff.
786580	791060	And it was these factors and their causes that event organizers began to consider in
791060	792580	the disaster's wake.
792580	796540	While Cincinnati went the furthest with an outright ban on general admission concerts,
796540	801540	entities across the US began adopting stricter regulation requirements for crowded events.
801540	805540	The National Fire Protection Association, a non-profit institution that authors model
805540	809860	safety codes for municipal and state-level adoption, entirely rethought aspects of its
809860	813820	life safety code to better account for crowd dynamics.
813820	818700	Since the WHO disaster, the landscape of live concert and events has fundamentally changed.
818700	822860	Today, most seats are assigned, and those that aren't are heavily monitored by crowd
822860	824820	managers and security.
824880	829380	European exit strategies, meanwhile, are no longer assumed, intuitive processes, but heavily
829380	833500	planned out, redundant, practice points of emphasis in event planning.
833500	838500	But crowd crush on account of entrance issues and unassigned seating has yet to be solved.
838500	843600	In London at the 2020 European Football Championship Final, videos of massive, unmanageable crowds
843600	847820	from outside the famed Wembley Stadium began surfacing on social media.
847820	851940	Ticketless England fans, it turned out, had shown up en masse for the final with the idea
851940	855020	of storming gates and overwhelming security.
855020	859860	Many were successful, as 2,000 forced their way into the stadium.
859860	863620	More importantly though, while crowds reached dangerous densities in the surge, there were
863620	865220	no casualties.
865220	869400	But it was close, as findings from a following investigation reported that there were some
869400	873880	6,000 additional fans ready to charge the stadium had England pulled off the victory,
873880	877460	and that the whole event hosted at one of Europe's finest sporting venues was on the
877460	882000	razor's edge of turning to a deadly disaster.
882000	886880	More recently, in January of 2023, north of London and east of Manchester, travelling
886880	891500	football fans of a more ruly disposition arrived at Sheffield Wednesday for an important playoff
891500	896500	game only to find themselves hopelessly packed into two narrow concourses in the stadium's
896500	897720	visitor end.
897720	901140	Following safety protocol, the turnstiles were even opened 30 minutes early to relieve
901140	905840	pressure at the gates, but once inside, the delay of fans identifying and navigating to
905840	909480	their seats, and the fact that some seats were covered, resulted in people piling in
909480	914240	the concourses, and hoisting crying kids in the air to relieve the mounting pressure.
914240	919160	It's been more than close calls, too—while the blame for the ten deaths and hundreds
919160	923600	of injuries at the 2021 Astroworld Festival in Houston, Texas has circulated between the
923600	927480	artist Travis Scott, the promoting company Live Nation, and the Austin-based organizer
927480	932520	Scormore in the courts of law and public opinion, one factor that's rather irrefutable was
932520	934940	bad venue design.
934940	937980	The ill-fated festival took place at the Energy Park.
937980	942780	Home to the NFL's Houston Texans, this 350-acre complex was designed for events capable of
942780	944900	hosting up to 200,000 people.
944900	948880	For the Astroworld Festival, though, this number was lowered by the Houston Fire Chief
948880	954300	to a maximum capacity of 50,000, but the issue here was not the size of the crowd, but the
954300	956100	layout of the venue.
956100	960080	Broken into two stages, it was expected that crowds would disperse between the secondary
960080	963740	and primary stages throughout the event, which they did.
963940	968100	But then the music ended on the second stage, and Travis Scott delayed his start on the
968100	969100	primary.
969100	973940	As the headliner, the anticipation was high, and the crowd was unruly to begin with, and
973940	979540	with a delay, the crowd began to grow as festival goers shifted from the west stage to the north.
979540	982780	Because of the location of barricades that were protecting operation tents and sound
982780	986380	systems though, this additional thrust of people wasn't able to dissipate through
986380	991300	the crowd, but instead it pushed an already dense crowd into what became effectively a
991300	992300	corral.
992340	997060	Tellingly, all the deaths occurred in this quadrant of the crowd—a function of bad
997060	1000620	timing and bad barricade configuration.
1000620	1005180	Of course, with the benefit of hindsight, the design flaws that turn an unruly, competitive
1005180	1010660	crowd, a poorly managed event, and a largely unregulated aspect of everyday life into horrific,
1010660	1013180	deadly traps is easy to identify.
1013180	1017280	But bad design is easier to identify than to fix.
1017280	1020000	Take this bridge complex, for example.
1020000	1025200	This bridge has existed in some form since the 1960s as the sole conduit that moves Muslim
1025200	1029400	pilgrims by the millions who are staying in the tent city of Mina to the Jamarat pillars
1029400	1032040	for the sacred practice of stoning the devil.
1032040	1036280	With only three pillars to stone though, and as of this century, over two million Muslims
1036280	1040440	a year making the trek to Mecca to take part in this Hajj ritual, this has been the site
1040440	1043640	of many deadly crowd crushes.
1043640	1048400	In 2004, 251 pilgrims died in a crush at the pillars.
1048400	1051840	In response, the Saudi government altered the shape of the pillars' walls to allow
1051840	1053840	for better crowd flow.
1053840	1056200	It helped, but didn't solve the problem.
1056200	1062560	In 2006, another 345 died in a crush on the bridge's entry ramp.
1062560	1067360	Small fixes, it appeared, just weren't working, so the Saudi government decided to reconfigure
1067360	1069400	the entire complex.
1069400	1074560	For $1 billion, the bridge was widened by 260 feet, or 80 meters, and atop it were now
1074560	1078980	four additional floors and a massive awning to protect from the sun.
1078980	1084320	The project was simply gigantic, signaling in no uncertain terms Saudi Arabia's investment
1084320	1088320	in crowd management for one of the world's single largest annual events.
1088320	1092320	With the ability to handle more than half a million pilgrims an hour, nearly two decades
1092320	1097120	on since its completion, the bridge has proved more than capable of accommodating ever-growing
1097120	1098120	crowds.
1098120	1103120	And yet, for as magnificent and expensive the complex is, it hasn't solved Saudi Arabia's
1103120	1104680	crowdcrush problems.
1104680	1108440	Just down the road from this complex, where pedestrian street 206 intersects with street
1108440	1114320	223 before then running into a simple T-intersection with street 204, Saudi Arabia in 2015 saw
1114320	1121960	its worst crowdcrush in the century, and likely ever, with an estimated 2,400 pilgrims dying
1121960	1126180	at an overlooked chokepoint between two commuter routes within eyeshot of the nation's most
1126180	1129020	impressive crowd control infrastructure.
1129020	1134060	In just hours, a problem that seemed fixed had taken a different shape, relocated at
1134060	1137300	the infrastructure's nearest weak point.
1137300	1142400	With the Hajj, or Astroworld, or the Who concert, or really any incident, the cause of the crush
1142400	1145140	always feels just so predictable.
1145140	1150460	They're all a perfect varying mix of an uncooperative crowd, competitive dynamics,
1150460	1154380	constrained architecture, and a bit of bad luck.
1154380	1158480	But of course, prediction is always easier in retrospect.
1158480	1162200	For every deadly festival crush, there are countless rowdy mosh pits having the times
1162200	1163560	of their lives.
1163560	1167680	For every doorbuster sale gone wrong, there are far more whose staggering numbers bring
1167680	1169440	the attention the retailer desires.
1169440	1174560	It is effectively impossible to completely eliminate all risky situations, because people
1174560	1177760	love these risky situations.
1177760	1182240	What ultimately makes the difference is rather simple, and rather boring—proper planning
1182240	1186280	to mitigate crush potential, knowledge of the risk factors, and the ability to identify
1186280	1189600	and respond when things get out of control.
1189600	1194000	Almost every incident involves the failure of one of those three steps, and therefore,
1194000	1197980	while the exact moments when a crush occurs might not be as predictable as it may seem,
1197980	1204000	the culpability for why they occur almost inevitably is.
1204000	1207560	Saudi Arabia's crowd control failures at the Hajj escalated to a point where they were
1207560	1210360	a legitimate geopolitical problem for the nation.
1210360	1216120	In the aftermath of the 2,400-fatality 2015 Mina stampede, Saudi-Iranian relations deteriorated
1216120	1219800	significantly due to the number of Iranian nationals killed.
1219800	1224520	After a long history of incidents, Saudi Arabia finally realized they had to get a grip on
1224520	1229800	the event, and invested a huge amount of money into designing a safer, more efficient Hajj
1229800	1231120	system.
1231120	1235840	Combining infrastructure, technology, psychology, and more, the modern Hajj is perhaps the most
1235840	1240980	organized event in the world, and has run accident-free since the 2015 crush.
1240980	1245020	As much as we wanted to cover how this works in this video, there simply wasn't time,
1245020	1249180	so rather we made a whole episode of our series Logistics of X about the logistics
1249180	1250320	of Hajj.
1250320	1254560	Like all the episodes of this series, that's exclusive to Nebula, the creator-founded and
1254560	1258860	creator-run streaming service that's designed to be the best home to the stuff we make.
1258860	1262620	We all upload our videos to there early and ad-free, and we use the subscription fees
1262620	1266440	to fund big-budget Nebula originals like the Logistics of X.
1266440	1270380	The concept is rather simple—digital creators know how to make stuff that people enjoy watching
1270380	1274060	on a tight budget, so when you give them a more generous budget, they make even better
1274060	1275240	stuff.
1275240	1278540	Our data proves that Nebula isn't just another streaming service that people sign up for
1278540	1283220	and then forget about—a far higher percentage of subscribers log in each day than with any
1283220	1287040	of the major, more expensive streamers, and subscribers stick around for longer as they
1287040	1289060	find the price worthwhile.
1289060	1293200	Over 50,000 Wendover viewers have subscribed so far, and if you want to see why, and watch
1293200	1297640	the Logistics of X, you can use our link, nebula.tv slash wendover, and you'll get
1297640	1303000	40% off an annual subscription, which brings the cost down to under $3 a month.
1303000	1306600	Not only that, but by using that link we'll get a portion of your subscription fee for
1306600	1310640	as long as you stay subscribed, which helps provide stable monthly income that we can
1310640	1314480	reinvest into the videos, so thanks in advance for your support.
