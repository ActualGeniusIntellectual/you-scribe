1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,240
This is the disaster scenario.

2
00:00:03,240 --> 00:00:04,960
It's Black Friday.

3
00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:09,920
An electronics store has acquired a massive supply of scarce 9th generation game consoles,

4
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:14,720
and to generate buzz, they're selling them at a massive discount—offering buyers an

5
00:00:14,720 --> 00:00:18,880
immediate arbitrage opportunity if they sell the devices on.

6
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:23,540
With a three-per-person limit, people can effectively earn hundreds of dollars just

7
00:00:23,540 --> 00:00:25,480
by standing in line.

8
00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:27,400
But there's not really a line.

9
00:00:27,880 --> 00:00:32,040
Rather, it's more of a mass, filling out the width of the pedestrian mall, growing

10
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:35,320
and growing in advance of its 9am opening time.

11
00:00:35,320 --> 00:00:39,920
The contracted security only arrives at 8am—they're able to push through to the entrance and get

12
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:43,480
on a megaphone to say, we need you to form an orderly line.

13
00:00:43,480 --> 00:00:47,880
There are only 500 consoles, we will not be able to accommodate everyone, so we need you

14
00:00:47,880 --> 00:00:50,600
to form an orderly line this way.

15
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:52,880
The crowd does not comply.

16
00:00:52,880 --> 00:00:57,380
The minutes count down, and upon opening time, the security team decides to carefully let

17
00:00:57,380 --> 00:01:01,560
small groups in from the front of the crowd, assuring that the store and its staff does

18
00:01:01,560 --> 00:01:03,760
not get stormed.

19
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:07,500
Fast forward 30 minutes, and this will lead to a crowd crush.

20
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:11,840
It's entirely predictable—the back of the crowd, concerned about the fast dwindling

21
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:16,460
supply of consoles, will each individually, almost subconsciously push forward.

22
00:01:16,460 --> 00:01:20,440
The core of the crowd will get compacted down, individuals will no longer have the ability

23
00:01:20,440 --> 00:01:25,760
to move freely, and an unlucky few will get asphyxiated—they quite literally will get

24
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:30,140
crushed so hard that they're unable to adequately breathe.

25
00:01:30,140 --> 00:01:34,800
Their closest way out is into the store, leading to a further push forward, but the security,

26
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:38,480
tasked with keeping the mass out of the store, will brush off the police for entry as an

27
00:01:38,480 --> 00:01:41,640
inevitable dynamic of a greedy, disorderly crowd.

28
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:45,960
That's to say, each of these three groups have different incentives—the back of the

29
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:49,680
crowd to get the consoles, the security to keep the crowd out, and the core of the crowd

30
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:55,960
to simply survive, but they'll all lead to the same result—an ever-escalating crush.

31
00:01:55,960 --> 00:02:01,080
But the absolute, overwhelming majority of crowds do not end up crushing themselves,

32
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:05,360
so what is it about this rather innocuous, all-too-believable situation that makes it

33
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:07,480
so theoretically dangerous?

34
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:10,280
Well, it starts with who the people are.

35
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:14,360
You see, there's an antiquated view that mass gatherings of people almost inevitably

36
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:19,480
devolve into a mindless state—that the participation in the collective dehumanizes the individual

37
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:23,780
and makes them more willing to act in a disruptive, dangerous way, but more recent research has

38
00:02:23,780 --> 00:02:25,600
started to dispel that notion.

39
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:29,440
Interestingly, in the exact situation where you'd expect people to disengage from the

40
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:34,440
collective good, panic, and work selfishly, in emergencies, people tend to do the exact

41
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:35,860
opposite.

42
00:02:35,860 --> 00:02:39,080
If a fire were to start in an overcrowded building, you might expect people to rush

43
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:43,040
the exits, to mindlessly push those in front just to get away from the threat, but that

44
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:45,620
happens remarkably rarely.

45
00:02:45,620 --> 00:02:50,320
Of the 21 major crowd crushes to have occurred so far this decade, just two involve people

46
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:54,640
running away from a deadly threat—one in Yemen spurred by an electrical explosion,

47
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:58,240
and one in Egypt where worshippers fled to escape a church fire.

48
00:02:58,240 --> 00:03:01,220
This is entirely counterintuitive.

49
00:03:01,220 --> 00:03:05,380
Running away from a fire is clearly a stronger incentive than gaining the right to buy a

50
00:03:05,380 --> 00:03:10,580
console, so researchers were curious as to why the frequency of crushes was so much lower

51
00:03:10,580 --> 00:03:13,900
in the direction with lower incentive.

52
00:03:13,900 --> 00:03:18,100
Consider a common anecdote—on a normal flight, people barely talk.

53
00:03:18,100 --> 00:03:22,500
They'll sit shoulder to shoulder with their fellow traveler for four or five hours without

54
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:28,220
even acknowledging their presence once, but as soon as a flight gets delayed, that changes.

55
00:03:28,220 --> 00:03:32,620
People start talking, they start problem solving, they get friendly, they'll even share food.

56
00:03:32,620 --> 00:03:36,400
If the flight gets cancelled, this cooperation often extends further, and those that were

57
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:40,260
complete strangers just minutes before might decide to work together and share a rental

58
00:03:40,260 --> 00:03:43,320
car to drive to their destination instead.

59
00:03:43,340 --> 00:03:47,680
Some psychologists have noticed the pervasiveness of this anecdote, and they think they have

60
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:48,680
an explanation.

61
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:51,560
It's all about identity.

62
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:55,140
When ambling around the airport, there is little shared identity beyond traveler, which

63
00:03:55,140 --> 00:04:00,160
is weak since it is shared by so many, but when a flight gets delayed, the identity shifts

64
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:01,160
and concentrates.

65
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:07,320
Now, it's distressed traveler—a unique identity shared only by the unlucky few.

66
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:11,660
What researchers have found is that the greater the degree of shared identity, the greater

67
00:04:11,660 --> 00:04:13,860
the degree of cooperation among a crowd.

68
00:04:13,860 --> 00:04:18,540
They're even able to test this—for example, in a simulated evacuation of a London Underground

69
00:04:18,540 --> 00:04:22,340
station, study participants were more likely to help a distressed person if that person

70
00:04:22,340 --> 00:04:26,220
was wearing the jersey of a football team the participant was a fan of.

71
00:04:26,220 --> 00:04:29,840
Conveniently, most events involve a shared identity.

72
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:34,340
People amass as fans of a team, followers of a religion, protesters for a cause—there

73
00:04:34,340 --> 00:04:39,020
is almost always a shared identity that justifies the assembly, which helps to keep order even

74
00:04:39,020 --> 00:04:41,740
when tens or hundreds of thousands of people gather.

75
00:04:41,740 --> 00:04:47,000
And this can help to explain the infrequency of evacuation-based crushes—on a normal

76
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:51,380
day in the London Underground, the mass' only shared identity is commuter.

77
00:04:51,380 --> 00:04:53,780
But then there's an explosion.

78
00:04:53,780 --> 00:04:59,260
In that moment, identity immediately concentrates and strengthens—now everyone is a victim

79
00:04:59,260 --> 00:05:01,900
of the same rare disaster.

80
00:05:01,900 --> 00:05:06,400
In the 2005 London Underground bombings, researchers interviewing victims observed a through-line

81
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:10,600
of perceived unity among the victims in the moment, and countless examples of selfless,

82
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:13,880
cooperative behavior even at the risk of personal peril.

83
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:19,720
This is observed in almost any disaster—there is always a high degree of crowd cooperation,

84
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:24,040
far beyond what might often be portrayed in fiction, that typically leads to rather orderly,

85
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:26,200
crush-free evacuations.

86
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:30,480
But another curious anomaly in crowd-crush statistics is that it is quite rare for them

87
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:36,420
to occur during civil unrest—during the very activity that defines mob mentality.

88
00:05:36,420 --> 00:05:41,040
The only major crush to occur during a riot this decade was 2022's Kanjurahan Stadium

89
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:45,520
disaster in Indonesia, but that was caused by a mass of field-invading football fans

90
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:49,720
fleeing from police-fired tear gas—not the riot itself.

91
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:54,280
The last major riot-related crush before that was also caused by police intervention during

92
00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:56,720
2016 protests in Ethiopia.

93
00:05:56,720 --> 00:06:01,160
As rare as it is to find a crush during a riot, it is yet rarer to find one where police

94
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:03,600
intervention is not the cause.

95
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:08,780
This is strange—according to traditional theories, people lose their sense of self

96
00:06:08,780 --> 00:06:13,200
during such activities, they act savagely, feeding off the energy of the masses, and

97
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:18,620
yet somehow, the very crowd in which one would expect the highest degree of disorder is able

98
00:06:18,620 --> 00:06:24,640
to avoid the worst better than the football or concert or ritual-going masses.

99
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:29,880
An explanation comes from the inverse—the annual Hajj pilgrimage, one of the world's

100
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:33,620
largest events where more than two million Muslims descend on Mecca to visit the spiritual

101
00:06:33,620 --> 00:06:36,480
center of the world's second-largest religion.

102
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:40,880
This is exactly the kind of event where one would expect to see high crowd cooperativeness—after

103
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:46,020
all, compounding the strong shared identities of Muslim and pilgrim, all two or three million

104
00:06:46,020 --> 00:06:50,320
are expected to be in a state of iran, or ritualistic purity of the body and mind to

105
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:54,020
the extent that they're not even allowed to break branches from trees, and yet, this

106
00:06:54,060 --> 00:07:00,180
pilgrimage was home to both the 20th and 21st century's most deadly, crowd-crushed tragedies,

107
00:07:00,180 --> 00:07:04,180
each counting, well, over a thousand dead.

108
00:07:04,180 --> 00:07:07,540
Considering the history, researchers have long used the Hajj as a source of study of

109
00:07:07,540 --> 00:07:13,420
crowd psychology, and one important conclusion came from the very center of the Muslim world—the

110
00:07:13,420 --> 00:07:14,420
Kaaba.

111
00:07:14,420 --> 00:07:18,820
This stone structure is said to be the House of Allah, the single holiest site in Islam,

112
00:07:18,820 --> 00:07:22,500
so one of the most significant elements of the Hajj is prayer in the Grand Mosque of

113
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:24,440
Mecca facing the Kaaba.

114
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:28,740
There are two main areas in which one can do this—the circular plaza, directly surrounding

115
00:07:28,740 --> 00:07:31,540
the Kaaba, or on the balconies above.

116
00:07:31,540 --> 00:07:35,780
The plaza is probably the best spot since it has an unobstructed view of the Kaaba,

117
00:07:35,780 --> 00:07:39,740
whereas the balconies have these pillars that obstruct the view for some.

118
00:07:39,740 --> 00:07:43,620
Researchers questioned how this might impact that all-important crowd cooperativeness,

119
00:07:43,620 --> 00:07:47,200
and therefore surveyed more than a thousand pilgrims to find out.

120
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:51,580
As they expected, the balconies—the area where there is a more variable experience,

121
00:07:51,580 --> 00:07:56,660
and experience improved by how much one pushes and shoves to get that best spot—saw a lower

122
00:07:56,660 --> 00:07:58,420
degree of crowd cooperativeness.

123
00:07:58,420 --> 00:08:04,640
That's to say, as competitiveness goes up, cooperativeness goes down.

124
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:09,540
In riots, though, there is little competitiveness—there is not a particular something to be gained

125
00:08:09,540 --> 00:08:13,380
or lost, and therefore there is little incentive to push and shove.

126
00:08:13,380 --> 00:08:18,220
Not only that, but there is typically a strong shared identity—before tensions escalated,

127
00:08:18,220 --> 00:08:21,860
a group of people gathered together in support of a particular cause.

128
00:08:21,860 --> 00:08:27,260
Therefore, riots feature two of the strongest predictors of lowered crowd-crush potential,

129
00:08:27,260 --> 00:08:31,500
explaining how some of the least organized events managed to avoid the worst.

130
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:36,500
Meanwhile, there's a particular situation at far more organized events that time and

131
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:38,580
time again has led to the worst.

132
00:08:38,580 --> 00:08:42,240
A group of people have spent a good bit of money buying tickets and a good bit of time

133
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:46,860
getting to a stadium to watch a concert, or a sporting match, or something, but with massive

134
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:52,300
crowds and limited entry throughput, the event is starting, and they're still outside.

135
00:08:52,300 --> 00:08:57,300
This exact competitive dynamic led to a 2023 crowd-crush in San Salvador, El Salvador,

136
00:08:57,300 --> 00:09:04,260
a 2022 crush in Yaounde, Cameroon, a 2019 one in Antananarivo, Madagascar, 2017 in Luange,

137
00:09:04,260 --> 00:09:09,720
Malawi, 2017 in Uengue, Angola—it is perhaps the most predictable crush scenario that still

138
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:10,720
occurs.

139
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:14,460
But you don't need to look for examples in developing countries for this particular

140
00:09:14,460 --> 00:09:17,820
situation—just look at concerts.

141
00:09:17,820 --> 00:09:22,700
What makes a good concert, according to most, is also what makes it dangerous, and that's

142
00:09:22,700 --> 00:09:23,700
unassigned seating.

143
00:09:23,700 --> 00:09:28,700
In a festival setting, unassigned seating is the norm, as seats of any sort are a rarity,

144
00:09:28,700 --> 00:09:32,940
and VIP tickets, as opposed to general admission tickets, often only provide benefits in the

145
00:09:32,940 --> 00:09:36,300
form of easier access and a less dense crowd.

146
00:09:36,300 --> 00:09:40,540
In tighter indoor and enclosed facilities, from small local venues to massive arenas

147
00:09:40,540 --> 00:09:45,220
and stadiums, there's often a split in ticket options—seated tickets and floor

148
00:09:45,220 --> 00:09:46,220
tickets.

149
00:09:46,220 --> 00:09:49,540
While seated tickets are easier on organizers and crowd experts, they're seen by concert

150
00:09:49,540 --> 00:09:55,540
goers and touring bands alike as boring, overly clinical, just low-energy, lifeless experiences.

151
00:09:55,540 --> 00:10:00,420
Because of this, bands and band fans insist on unassigned floor seating, where energy

152
00:10:00,420 --> 00:10:03,520
is high and crowd interaction is more dynamic.

153
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:07,540
And yet, despite all its appeal to everyone but the organizers, general admission seating

154
00:10:07,540 --> 00:10:14,020
in the city of Cincinnati was entirely banned from 1979 to 2004.

155
00:10:14,020 --> 00:10:19,240
The 24 and a half year ban dates back to a Who concert on December 3, 1979.

156
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:24,860
A much-anticipated show, and one that easily sold out the 18,348 unassigned seats available

157
00:10:24,860 --> 00:10:29,300
at Cincinnati's Riverfront Stadium, the concert was supposed to be a celebration,

158
00:10:29,300 --> 00:10:34,340
not a watershed moment in crowd control and live event policy the world over.

159
00:10:34,340 --> 00:10:39,100
Of course, in any unassigned seating environment, there's inherent competition—for the best

160
00:10:39,100 --> 00:10:41,760
view, people push their way to the front.

161
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:45,740
In this particular situation, this competition only compounded.

162
00:10:45,740 --> 00:10:49,380
In order to get in the best position to push their way to the front, thousands had lined

163
00:10:49,380 --> 00:10:51,380
up outside the venue.

164
00:10:51,380 --> 00:10:55,580
Afternoon then gave way to evening, the crowd grew cold waiting, and once the venue finally

165
00:10:55,580 --> 00:10:59,780
opened, those at the front were surprised to see only two meager doors swing wide to

166
00:10:59,780 --> 00:11:02,900
welcome nearly 20,000.

167
00:11:02,900 --> 00:11:06,940
When patience grew, and tensions rose across the crowd with the delay in entry.

168
00:11:06,940 --> 00:11:12,340
Then, at the sound of a late soundcheck confused as the beginning of the concert, the dam broke.

169
00:11:12,340 --> 00:11:15,940
The push began from the back, far outside the venue, but the compounding pressure was

170
00:11:15,940 --> 00:11:20,100
felt at the front, where people poured through the two open doors with scratches, torn shirt,

171
00:11:20,100 --> 00:11:23,860
and without shoes while others ripped at the countless other doors still closed, not to

172
00:11:23,860 --> 00:11:27,460
cut in line, but to release the building pressure.

173
00:11:27,460 --> 00:11:34,500
At the entrance, the crowd collapsed, then it crushed, leaving 11 dead and dozens injured.

174
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:39,280
In the tragedy's wake, much was made of the character of those involved—their motives,

175
00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:43,740
the substances they had taken, and the rock and roll culture that they had ascribed to.

176
00:11:43,740 --> 00:11:48,020
This much, in the aftermath of crowd-related tragedies, is a recurrent theme.

177
00:11:48,020 --> 00:11:52,160
At sporting matches, it's hooliganism, at concerts and festivals, it's youth culture,

178
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:54,580
at religious events, it's fanaticism.

179
00:11:54,700 --> 00:11:58,340
At that base, it's all bad design.

180
00:11:58,340 --> 00:12:03,020
What blaming a selfish, crazed crowd doesn't account for is the disconnect between overmatched

181
00:12:03,020 --> 00:12:07,060
and understaffed security ushering nearly 20,000 people through only two doors.

182
00:12:07,060 --> 00:12:10,820
It doesn't account for people rushing those doors, not to get the best spot, but to find

183
00:12:10,820 --> 00:12:11,820
enough room to breathe.

184
00:12:11,820 --> 00:12:15,420
It doesn't account for those at the back shuffling forward, not out of ill will, but

185
00:12:15,420 --> 00:12:19,260
a lack of understanding as to the pressure they're exerting on the front.

186
00:12:19,260 --> 00:12:22,940
Blaming the crowd also fails to account for the fact that once crowd density begins to

187
00:12:22,940 --> 00:12:27,640
reach dangerous levels, individual agency goes out the window.

188
00:12:27,640 --> 00:12:32,060
In fact, at crowd densities that reach higher than 5 people per square meter, a mark that's

189
00:12:32,060 --> 00:12:36,460
considered high-risk for fall and trampling, individuals lose the ability to control their

190
00:12:36,460 --> 00:12:41,000
own movement and are instead at the whim of shockwaves rippling through the crowd.

191
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:45,740
At this point, the principles defining crowd movement are closer to fluid dynamics than

192
00:12:45,740 --> 00:12:46,740
anything else.

193
00:12:46,740 --> 00:12:51,220
It was the culmination of such factors—the disconnect between security, the front of

194
00:12:51,220 --> 00:12:54,620
the crowd, and the back of the crowd—along with inability once caught in the crush to

195
00:12:54,620 --> 00:12:58,880
do anything but move with the shockwaves, that ultimately informed what's now known

196
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:03,060
as the WHO disaster—factors that were out of the crowd's control, and factors that

197
00:13:03,060 --> 00:13:06,580
stemmed from a poorly prepared venue and overmatched staff.

198
00:13:06,580 --> 00:13:11,060
And it was these factors and their causes that event organizers began to consider in

199
00:13:11,060 --> 00:13:12,580
the disaster's wake.

200
00:13:12,580 --> 00:13:16,540
While Cincinnati went the furthest with an outright ban on general admission concerts,

201
00:13:16,540 --> 00:13:21,540
entities across the US began adopting stricter regulation requirements for crowded events.

202
00:13:21,540 --> 00:13:25,540
The National Fire Protection Association, a non-profit institution that authors model

203
00:13:25,540 --> 00:13:29,860
safety codes for municipal and state-level adoption, entirely rethought aspects of its

204
00:13:29,860 --> 00:13:33,820
life safety code to better account for crowd dynamics.

205
00:13:33,820 --> 00:13:38,700
Since the WHO disaster, the landscape of live concert and events has fundamentally changed.

206
00:13:38,700 --> 00:13:42,860
Today, most seats are assigned, and those that aren't are heavily monitored by crowd

207
00:13:42,860 --> 00:13:44,820
managers and security.

208
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:49,380
European exit strategies, meanwhile, are no longer assumed, intuitive processes, but heavily

209
00:13:49,380 --> 00:13:53,500
planned out, redundant, practice points of emphasis in event planning.

210
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:58,500
But crowd crush on account of entrance issues and unassigned seating has yet to be solved.

211
00:13:58,500 --> 00:14:03,600
In London at the 2020 European Football Championship Final, videos of massive, unmanageable crowds

212
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:07,820
from outside the famed Wembley Stadium began surfacing on social media.

213
00:14:07,820 --> 00:14:11,940
Ticketless England fans, it turned out, had shown up en masse for the final with the idea

214
00:14:11,940 --> 00:14:15,020
of storming gates and overwhelming security.

215
00:14:15,020 --> 00:14:19,860
Many were successful, as 2,000 forced their way into the stadium.

216
00:14:19,860 --> 00:14:23,620
More importantly though, while crowds reached dangerous densities in the surge, there were

217
00:14:23,620 --> 00:14:25,220
no casualties.

218
00:14:25,220 --> 00:14:29,400
But it was close, as findings from a following investigation reported that there were some

219
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:33,880
6,000 additional fans ready to charge the stadium had England pulled off the victory,

220
00:14:33,880 --> 00:14:37,460
and that the whole event hosted at one of Europe's finest sporting venues was on the

221
00:14:37,460 --> 00:14:42,000
razor's edge of turning to a deadly disaster.

222
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:46,880
More recently, in January of 2023, north of London and east of Manchester, travelling

223
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:51,500
football fans of a more ruly disposition arrived at Sheffield Wednesday for an important playoff

224
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:56,500
game only to find themselves hopelessly packed into two narrow concourses in the stadium's

225
00:14:56,500 --> 00:14:57,720
visitor end.

226
00:14:57,720 --> 00:15:01,140
Following safety protocol, the turnstiles were even opened 30 minutes early to relieve

227
00:15:01,140 --> 00:15:05,840
pressure at the gates, but once inside, the delay of fans identifying and navigating to

228
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:09,480
their seats, and the fact that some seats were covered, resulted in people piling in

229
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:14,240
the concourses, and hoisting crying kids in the air to relieve the mounting pressure.

230
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:19,160
It's been more than close calls, too—while the blame for the ten deaths and hundreds

231
00:15:19,160 --> 00:15:23,600
of injuries at the 2021 Astroworld Festival in Houston, Texas has circulated between the

232
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:27,480
artist Travis Scott, the promoting company Live Nation, and the Austin-based organizer

233
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:32,520
Scormore in the courts of law and public opinion, one factor that's rather irrefutable was

234
00:15:32,520 --> 00:15:34,940
bad venue design.

235
00:15:34,940 --> 00:15:37,980
The ill-fated festival took place at the Energy Park.

236
00:15:37,980 --> 00:15:42,780
Home to the NFL's Houston Texans, this 350-acre complex was designed for events capable of

237
00:15:42,780 --> 00:15:44,900
hosting up to 200,000 people.

238
00:15:44,900 --> 00:15:48,880
For the Astroworld Festival, though, this number was lowered by the Houston Fire Chief

239
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:54,300
to a maximum capacity of 50,000, but the issue here was not the size of the crowd, but the

240
00:15:54,300 --> 00:15:56,100
layout of the venue.

241
00:15:56,100 --> 00:16:00,080
Broken into two stages, it was expected that crowds would disperse between the secondary

242
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:03,740
and primary stages throughout the event, which they did.

243
00:16:03,940 --> 00:16:08,100
But then the music ended on the second stage, and Travis Scott delayed his start on the

244
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:09,100
primary.

245
00:16:09,100 --> 00:16:13,940
As the headliner, the anticipation was high, and the crowd was unruly to begin with, and

246
00:16:13,940 --> 00:16:19,540
with a delay, the crowd began to grow as festival goers shifted from the west stage to the north.

247
00:16:19,540 --> 00:16:22,780
Because of the location of barricades that were protecting operation tents and sound

248
00:16:22,780 --> 00:16:26,380
systems though, this additional thrust of people wasn't able to dissipate through

249
00:16:26,380 --> 00:16:31,300
the crowd, but instead it pushed an already dense crowd into what became effectively a

250
00:16:31,300 --> 00:16:32,300
corral.

251
00:16:32,340 --> 00:16:37,060
Tellingly, all the deaths occurred in this quadrant of the crowd—a function of bad

252
00:16:37,060 --> 00:16:40,620
timing and bad barricade configuration.

253
00:16:40,620 --> 00:16:45,180
Of course, with the benefit of hindsight, the design flaws that turn an unruly, competitive

254
00:16:45,180 --> 00:16:50,660
crowd, a poorly managed event, and a largely unregulated aspect of everyday life into horrific,

255
00:16:50,660 --> 00:16:53,180
deadly traps is easy to identify.

256
00:16:53,180 --> 00:16:57,280
But bad design is easier to identify than to fix.

257
00:16:57,280 --> 00:17:00,000
Take this bridge complex, for example.

258
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:05,200
This bridge has existed in some form since the 1960s as the sole conduit that moves Muslim

259
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:09,400
pilgrims by the millions who are staying in the tent city of Mina to the Jamarat pillars

260
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:12,040
for the sacred practice of stoning the devil.

261
00:17:12,040 --> 00:17:16,280
With only three pillars to stone though, and as of this century, over two million Muslims

262
00:17:16,280 --> 00:17:20,440
a year making the trek to Mecca to take part in this Hajj ritual, this has been the site

263
00:17:20,440 --> 00:17:23,640
of many deadly crowd crushes.

264
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:28,400
In 2004, 251 pilgrims died in a crush at the pillars.

265
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:31,840
In response, the Saudi government altered the shape of the pillars' walls to allow

266
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:33,840
for better crowd flow.

267
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:36,200
It helped, but didn't solve the problem.

268
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:42,560
In 2006, another 345 died in a crush on the bridge's entry ramp.

269
00:17:42,560 --> 00:17:47,360
Small fixes, it appeared, just weren't working, so the Saudi government decided to reconfigure

270
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:49,400
the entire complex.

271
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:54,560
For $1 billion, the bridge was widened by 260 feet, or 80 meters, and atop it were now

272
00:17:54,560 --> 00:17:58,980
four additional floors and a massive awning to protect from the sun.

273
00:17:58,980 --> 00:18:04,320
The project was simply gigantic, signaling in no uncertain terms Saudi Arabia's investment

274
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:08,320
in crowd management for one of the world's single largest annual events.

275
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:12,320
With the ability to handle more than half a million pilgrims an hour, nearly two decades

276
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:17,120
on since its completion, the bridge has proved more than capable of accommodating ever-growing

277
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:18,120
crowds.

278
00:18:18,120 --> 00:18:23,120
And yet, for as magnificent and expensive the complex is, it hasn't solved Saudi Arabia's

279
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:24,680
crowdcrush problems.

280
00:18:24,680 --> 00:18:28,440
Just down the road from this complex, where pedestrian street 206 intersects with street

281
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:34,320
223 before then running into a simple T-intersection with street 204, Saudi Arabia in 2015 saw

282
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:41,960
its worst crowdcrush in the century, and likely ever, with an estimated 2,400 pilgrims dying

283
00:18:41,960 --> 00:18:46,180
at an overlooked chokepoint between two commuter routes within eyeshot of the nation's most

284
00:18:46,180 --> 00:18:49,020
impressive crowd control infrastructure.

285
00:18:49,020 --> 00:18:54,060
In just hours, a problem that seemed fixed had taken a different shape, relocated at

286
00:18:54,060 --> 00:18:57,300
the infrastructure's nearest weak point.

287
00:18:57,300 --> 00:19:02,400
With the Hajj, or Astroworld, or the Who concert, or really any incident, the cause of the crush

288
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:05,140
always feels just so predictable.

289
00:19:05,140 --> 00:19:10,460
They're all a perfect varying mix of an uncooperative crowd, competitive dynamics,

290
00:19:10,460 --> 00:19:14,380
constrained architecture, and a bit of bad luck.

291
00:19:14,380 --> 00:19:18,480
But of course, prediction is always easier in retrospect.

292
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:22,200
For every deadly festival crush, there are countless rowdy mosh pits having the times

293
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:23,560
of their lives.

294
00:19:23,560 --> 00:19:27,680
For every doorbuster sale gone wrong, there are far more whose staggering numbers bring

295
00:19:27,680 --> 00:19:29,440
the attention the retailer desires.

296
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:34,560
It is effectively impossible to completely eliminate all risky situations, because people

297
00:19:34,560 --> 00:19:37,760
love these risky situations.

298
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:42,240
What ultimately makes the difference is rather simple, and rather boring—proper planning

299
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:46,280
to mitigate crush potential, knowledge of the risk factors, and the ability to identify

300
00:19:46,280 --> 00:19:49,600
and respond when things get out of control.

301
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:54,000
Almost every incident involves the failure of one of those three steps, and therefore,

302
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:57,980
while the exact moments when a crush occurs might not be as predictable as it may seem,

303
00:19:57,980 --> 00:20:04,000
the culpability for why they occur almost inevitably is.

304
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:07,560
Saudi Arabia's crowd control failures at the Hajj escalated to a point where they were

305
00:20:07,560 --> 00:20:10,360
a legitimate geopolitical problem for the nation.

306
00:20:10,360 --> 00:20:16,120
In the aftermath of the 2,400-fatality 2015 Mina stampede, Saudi-Iranian relations deteriorated

307
00:20:16,120 --> 00:20:19,800
significantly due to the number of Iranian nationals killed.

308
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:24,520
After a long history of incidents, Saudi Arabia finally realized they had to get a grip on

309
00:20:24,520 --> 00:20:29,800
the event, and invested a huge amount of money into designing a safer, more efficient Hajj

310
00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:31,120
system.

311
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:35,840
Combining infrastructure, technology, psychology, and more, the modern Hajj is perhaps the most

312
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:40,980
organized event in the world, and has run accident-free since the 2015 crush.

313
00:20:40,980 --> 00:20:45,020
As much as we wanted to cover how this works in this video, there simply wasn't time,

314
00:20:45,020 --> 00:20:49,180
so rather we made a whole episode of our series Logistics of X about the logistics

315
00:20:49,180 --> 00:20:50,320
of Hajj.

316
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:54,560
Like all the episodes of this series, that's exclusive to Nebula, the creator-founded and

317
00:20:54,560 --> 00:20:58,860
creator-run streaming service that's designed to be the best home to the stuff we make.

318
00:20:58,860 --> 00:21:02,620
We all upload our videos to there early and ad-free, and we use the subscription fees

319
00:21:02,620 --> 00:21:06,440
to fund big-budget Nebula originals like the Logistics of X.

320
00:21:06,440 --> 00:21:10,380
The concept is rather simple—digital creators know how to make stuff that people enjoy watching

321
00:21:10,380 --> 00:21:14,060
on a tight budget, so when you give them a more generous budget, they make even better

322
00:21:14,060 --> 00:21:15,240
stuff.

323
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:18,540
Our data proves that Nebula isn't just another streaming service that people sign up for

324
00:21:18,540 --> 00:21:23,220
and then forget about—a far higher percentage of subscribers log in each day than with any

325
00:21:23,220 --> 00:21:27,040
of the major, more expensive streamers, and subscribers stick around for longer as they

326
00:21:27,040 --> 00:21:29,060
find the price worthwhile.

327
00:21:29,060 --> 00:21:33,200
Over 50,000 Wendover viewers have subscribed so far, and if you want to see why, and watch

328
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:37,640
the Logistics of X, you can use our link, nebula.tv slash wendover, and you'll get

329
00:21:37,640 --> 00:21:43,000
40% off an annual subscription, which brings the cost down to under $3 a month.

330
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:46,600
Not only that, but by using that link we'll get a portion of your subscription fee for

331
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:50,640
as long as you stay subscribed, which helps provide stable monthly income that we can

332
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:54,480
reinvest into the videos, so thanks in advance for your support.
