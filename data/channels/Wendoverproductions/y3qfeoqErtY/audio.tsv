8740	14940	Overnight shipping is an absolute masterpiece of logistics that happens every single night.
14940	19840	It may not be cheap, but you can get a package shipped from Miami, Florida on a Monday to
19840	23560	Anchorage, Alaska by 8.30am on Tuesday.
23560	28100	In fact, you can even ship a package, for example, from Edinburgh, Scotland on a Tuesday
28100	32900	and have the package arrive in Anchorage, Alaska by 9.00am on Wednesday.
32900	37820	The speed and efficiency of these worldwide delivery networks is mind-blowing and it all
37820	39900	happens while we sleep.
39900	45100	The three major consumer courier companies are FedEx, DHL, and UPS and each of them is
45100	46980	as impressive as the last.
46980	52100	FedEx has more planes than Emirates, Etihad, and Qatar Airways combined, DHL delivers to
52100	56920	every country in the world including North Korea, and UPS flies to more than double as
56920	60160	many destinations as the largest passenger airline.
60160	64640	Each has a global network that allows for lightning fast shipping at relatively low
64640	65720	prices.
65720	71080	Behind all this speed are enormous air networks that connect the entire world daily.
71080	76060	Each of these three operates hundreds of flights nightly, but FedEx is the best example since
76060	80040	their operations make them the largest cargo airline in the world.
80040	86720	They have 650 planes flying to 400 destinations carrying 6 million packages every single day
86720	91760	and the vast majority of these flights operate to or from one of their hub airports.
91760	96320	FedEx's hub airports are spread out all across the world and serve as sorting points
96320	99360	where packages are transferred from one plane to another.
99360	105480	They have hubs in Singapore, Guangzhou, Shanghai, Seoul, Osaka, Anchorage, Oakland, Dallas,
105480	111760	Indianapolis, Greensboro, Miami, Newark, Toronto, Paris, Cologne, Milan, and Dubai, but the
111760	117640	most important hub of all is the one in Memphis, Tennessee because that's their super hub.
117640	123520	Memphis is not a huge city, only about 650,000 people live there, but the reason FedEx centers
123520	127960	their worldwide operations in this city is because of its location.
127960	132640	Memphis is not actually in the geographic center of the US as might make sense, but
132640	134280	it is central.
134280	139440	You see only about 200 miles away in Wright County, Missouri is the mean population center
139440	140780	of the US.
140780	145540	This is the average location of every resident in the US meaning that the FedEx super hub
145540	150740	in Memphis is the best location to reach the most people in the shortest amount of time.
150740	156380	For similar reasons, UPS has their equivalent global hub, Worldport, nearby in Louisville,
156380	157380	Kentucky.
157380	163020	The scale of FedEx and UPS's operations in these relatively small cities is staggering.
163020	167660	This is the size of the commercial terminal at Memphis airport while this is the size
167660	169220	of FedEx's super hub.
169220	173500	The difference at Louisville airport is even more pronounced where this is the commercial
173500	176740	terminal and this is UPS's Worldport.
176740	181640	You can't even fly to the west coast non-stop on a commercial airline from Louisville and
181640	186620	yet UPS flies from this small city to five different continents.
186620	191700	FedEx's operations in Memphis, meanwhile, make this airport the second busiest cargo
191700	198060	airport in the world above those of enormous cities like Tokyo, Paris, Dubai, Shanghai,
198060	200360	and falling short only to Hong Kong.
200360	205820	How the FedEx super hub really works is that every night, about 150 planes fly in from
205820	209580	all around the world between the hours of 10 PM and 1 AM.
209580	214020	Immediately upon arrival, the planes are unloaded and their packages are put into the hub's
214020	215840	automated sorting system.
215840	220260	Within only 15 minutes, each package arrives at a staging area for its next flight where
220260	222300	it's loaded into containers.
222300	227460	Planes therefore can start taking off again at 2 AM and continue to until 4 AM which means
227460	232540	that everywhere in the US can have a FedEx plane arriving by 6 AM, but there are some
232540	237440	destinations that don't ship enough packages to need a non-stop flight to Memphis.
237440	243140	To get to small towns fast, FedEx runs flights in small propeller aircraft from the destinations
243140	244820	of their larger jets.
244820	249460	Presque Isle, Maine, for example, is far too small of a town at about 10,000 residents
249460	254700	to fill a full-size plane so, every morning, whence the larger planes from Memphis arrive
254700	259040	in Manchester, New Hampshire, and Portland, Maine, packages bound for Presque Isle are
259040	262420	sorted into smaller prop planes that continue north.
262420	267740	With this system, even towns like Presque Isle get their packages by 9 AM as every spoke
267740	271460	in the system essentially functions as a mini-hub.
271460	276180	Packages are transferred from planes to smaller planes to trucks to reach their destination
276180	277780	as fast as possible.
277780	282980	Now, it's important to note that not every FedEx package runs through Memphis.
282980	287540	That would be incredibly inefficient if a customer wanted to, for example, ship a package
287540	290220	from Phoenix, Arizona to Seattle, Washington.
290220	294900	While only 1,100 miles separate Seattle from Phoenix, a routing through Memphis would total
294900	298300	over 3,000 miles and six hours in flight.
298300	302660	The package would still make it overnight, but FedEx would be wasting fuel carrying that
302660	308020	package an extra 1,900 miles so that's why they have secondary hubs.
308020	312820	In this case, FedEx's Oakland hub has flights to both Phoenix and Seattle so the package
312820	316460	would take a relatively efficient 1,300 mile routing.
316460	321480	Memphis essentially serves as the backup hub in case there's not a more efficient routing.
321480	325980	The secondary hubs, such as Oakland, in general have flights to destinations that are already
325980	330940	served by flights to Memphis, but the destinations from Oakland are high demand destinations
330940	336300	that ship enough packages solely to the west coast to fill entire planes to Oakland.
336300	340740	Some destinations, such as Albuquerque, New Mexico, ship enough packages to fill entire
340740	345940	planes to Memphis, but not enough to fill flights to Oakland with west coast bound packages.
345940	350100	So a package shipped from here to the west coast would likely take a rather inefficient
350100	352500	routing backtracking to Memphis.
352500	357140	But FedEx's most ingenious hub is here in Anchorage, Alaska.
357140	362900	Anchorage, with fewer than 300,000 residents, is home to the fourth busiest cargo airport
362900	364300	in the world.
364300	367520	This is, once again, thanks to geography.
367520	371960	If you draw a straight line from FedEx's Memphis hub to the one in Osaka, taking into
371960	376600	account earth's curvature, it goes directly over Anchorage, Alaska.
376600	381200	This airport is just the perfect stopover points for flights from the US to Asia.
381200	386120	Now, dozens of cargo airlines operate in Anchorage but most of them just use the airport as a
386120	388640	refueling and crew swap spot.
388640	393000	Modern airplanes can fly non-stop from the contiguous United States to Asia, but doing
393000	397040	so requires taking more fuel which requires taking less cargo.
397040	401880	It's just cheaper to stop in Anchorage, but FedEx and UPS use the stop for something
401880	403720	else—sorting.
403720	407520	If FedEx wanted to maintain current shipping times without the Anchorage hub they would
407520	411800	likely have to run non-stop flights from each of their Asian hubs to each of their American
411800	415520	hubs, but they don't have the demand to fill this many planes.
415520	419540	Instead, they run flights from their Asian hubs to Anchorage then flights from Anchorage
419540	421460	to many of their American hubs.
421460	425680	While stopped in Anchorage, packages from Asia are processed through customs and sorted
425680	429000	to be put on the plane bound closest for their destination.
429000	432760	This helps cut down on shipping time and cost.
432760	435940	Shipping is an incredibly price-sensitive business.
435940	440920	These courier companies rely on enormous contracts with retailers and, when some of these retailers
440920	445600	are shipping millions of packages per day, every cent matters.
445600	450980	In a lot of ways, however, the express shipping model is inherently expensive largely because
450980	455640	of how couriers use their most expensive assets—planes.
455640	460400	So much is centered around those few sorting hours at the big hubs so FedEx's planes
460400	464480	all have to wait around to arrive at the exact right moment.
464480	469540	Some FedEx hubs, such as Memphis, do sort packages during the day, but the overwhelming
469540	472360	majority of their business happens overnight.
472360	477440	FedEx's flight from Memphis to Oklahoma City, for example, leaves at 4am and arrives
477440	484240	at 5.20am, but then the plane waits around until 10.10pm to fly back to Memphis.
484240	489780	That's over 17 hours sitting in Oklahoma City and, on that route, the plane is only
489780	492680	flying for about two hours per day.
492680	497720	Meanwhile, commercial airlines regularly fly their planes for more than 12 hours per day
497720	501680	meaning that they have six times higher aircraft utilization.
501680	506560	FedEx would never be profitable if they bought all new, multi-hundred million dollar aircraft
506560	509960	to use for mere hours per day, so they don't.
509960	515200	Overwhelmingly, FedEx and other cargo airlines use old aircraft at the end of their lives.
515200	520920	You'll almost never see Airbus A300s flying for passenger airlines anymore, yet FedEx,
520920	525720	UPS, and DHL collectively own hundreds of them because they're cheap.
525720	529500	They didn't spend much purchasing these aircraft so they don't have to worry about
529500	532160	using them enough to offset their cost.
532160	538300	UPS does have some brand new 747-800 aircraft which are highly efficient, but they specifically
538300	542740	schedule these planes on their longest routes so that they can recuperate their high purchase
542740	545140	price through lower fuel costs.
545140	549980	With older aircraft, fuel costs might be higher since the planes are less efficient, but overall
549980	554780	it's worth it since it allows FedEx to profitably leave their planes sitting for all but a few
554780	556360	hours each day.
556360	561300	Some passenger airlines, such as Legion Airlines in the US, use the same strategy purchasing
561300	565900	cheaper planes to allow them to fly fewer hours per day profitably and it's now a
565900	568660	tested and proven business strategy.
568660	573020	Express Shipping is one of those businesses that requires enormous networks to make work
573020	575780	which is why you don't see small shipping companies.
575780	580900	It's almost impossible to get started in this business unless, of course, you can make
580900	582380	your own demand.
582380	587540	Amazon, which ships more than a million packages per day, is getting into the delivery business.
587540	592900	They've established a fleet of 32 aircraft and are building out their logistics network.
592900	598380	In shipping so many packages, Amazon is operating at a scale where they can profit by taking
598380	600700	the shipping companies out of the equation.
600700	606660	FedEx, UPS, and DHL, meanwhile, are continuously focusing on further increasing the efficiency
606660	611700	of their networks since in this business more than any, time is money.
611700	615660	As you may have noticed, Wendover Productions has a new logo and with that I've redesigned
615660	617380	the website with Squarespace.
617380	621640	To be honest, I hadn't used the website builder in a while, but this process reminded
621640	624360	me of why I'm such a fan of Squarespace.
624360	628960	It was super simple to completely overhaul the site and, in my opinion, it looks great.
628960	634400	I didn't have any issues, but if you ever do they have award-winning 24-7 customer support
634400	636840	that I have used in the past and can vouch for.
636840	641340	If you run a business, a YouTube channel, a podcast, or anything else you want to have
641340	646080	a professional web presence like I do with my site since that's how people find you
646080	653040	and you can get started building your website with Squarespace for 10% off at squarespace.com.com.
653040	656760	Squarespace is a great supporter of the show so make sure to show them your appreciation
656760	661200	by at least checking them out at squarespace.com.com.
661200	664800	And just one more thing, if you're like me and the first reaction you had to seeing
664800	669140	this new logo is wanting a t-shirt of it, you're in luck because they're now available
669140	671360	for pre-order at DFTBA.
671360	672720	The link is in the description.
