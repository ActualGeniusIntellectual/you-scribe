00:00:08,740 --> 00:00:14,940
Overnight shipping is an absolute masterpiece of logistics that happens every single night.

4
00:00:14,940 --> 00:00:19,840
It may not be cheap, but you can get a package shipped from Miami, Florida on a Monday to

5
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:23,560
Anchorage, Alaska by 8.30am on Tuesday.

6
00:00:23,560 --> 00:00:28,100
In fact, you can even ship a package, for example, from Edinburgh, Scotland on a Tuesday

7
00:00:28,100 --> 00:00:32,900
and have the package arrive in Anchorage, Alaska by 9.00am on Wednesday.

8
00:00:32,900 --> 00:00:37,820
The speed and efficiency of these worldwide delivery networks is mind-blowing and it all

9
00:00:37,820 --> 00:00:39,900
happens while we sleep.

10
00:00:39,900 --> 00:00:45,100
The three major consumer courier companies are FedEx, DHL, and UPS and each of them is

11
00:00:45,100 --> 00:00:46,980
as impressive as the last.

12
00:00:46,980 --> 00:00:52,100
FedEx has more planes than Emirates, Etihad, and Qatar Airways combined, DHL delivers to

13
00:00:52,100 --> 00:00:56,920
every country in the world including North Korea, and UPS flies to more than double as

14
00:00:56,920 --> 00:01:00,160
many destinations as the largest passenger airline.

15
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:04,640
Each has a global network that allows for lightning fast shipping at relatively low

16
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:05,720
prices.

17
00:01:05,720 --> 00:01:11,080
Behind all this speed are enormous air networks that connect the entire world daily.

18
00:01:11,080 --> 00:01:16,060
Each of these three operates hundreds of flights nightly, but FedEx is the best example since

19
00:01:16,060 --> 00:01:20,040
their operations make them the largest cargo airline in the world.

20
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:26,720
They have 650 planes flying to 400 destinations carrying 6 million packages every single day

21
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:31,760
and the vast majority of these flights operate to or from one of their hub airports.

22
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:36,320
FedEx's hub airports are spread out all across the world and serve as sorting points

23
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:39,360
where packages are transferred from one plane to another.

24
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:45,480
They have hubs in Singapore, Guangzhou, Shanghai, Seoul, Osaka, Anchorage, Oakland, Dallas,

25
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:51,760
Indianapolis, Greensboro, Miami, Newark, Toronto, Paris, Cologne, Milan, and Dubai, but the

26
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:57,640
most important hub of all is the one in Memphis, Tennessee because that's their super hub.

27
00:01:57,640 --> 00:02:03,520
Memphis is not a huge city, only about 650,000 people live there, but the reason FedEx centers

28
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:07,960
their worldwide operations in this city is because of its location.

29
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:12,640
Memphis is not actually in the geographic center of the US as might make sense, but

30
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:14,280
it is central.

31
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:19,440
You see only about 200 miles away in Wright County, Missouri is the mean population center

32
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:20,780
of the US.

33
00:02:20,780 --> 00:02:25,540
This is the average location of every resident in the US meaning that the FedEx super hub

34
00:02:25,540 --> 00:02:30,740
in Memphis is the best location to reach the most people in the shortest amount of time.

35
00:02:30,740 --> 00:02:36,380
For similar reasons, UPS has their equivalent global hub, Worldport, nearby in Louisville,

36
00:02:36,380 --> 00:02:37,380
Kentucky.

37
00:02:37,380 --> 00:02:43,020
The scale of FedEx and UPS's operations in these relatively small cities is staggering.

38
00:02:43,020 --> 00:02:47,660
This is the size of the commercial terminal at Memphis airport while this is the size

39
00:02:47,660 --> 00:02:49,220
of FedEx's super hub.

40
00:02:49,220 --> 00:02:53,500
The difference at Louisville airport is even more pronounced where this is the commercial

41
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:56,740
terminal and this is UPS's Worldport.

42
00:02:56,740 --> 00:03:01,640
You can't even fly to the west coast non-stop on a commercial airline from Louisville and

43
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:06,620
yet UPS flies from this small city to five different continents.

44
00:03:06,620 --> 00:03:11,700
FedEx's operations in Memphis, meanwhile, make this airport the second busiest cargo

45
00:03:11,700 --> 00:03:18,060
airport in the world above those of enormous cities like Tokyo, Paris, Dubai, Shanghai,

46
00:03:18,060 --> 00:03:20,360
and falling short only to Hong Kong.

47
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:25,820
How the FedEx super hub really works is that every night, about 150 planes fly in from

48
00:03:25,820 --> 00:03:29,580
all around the world between the hours of 10 PM and 1 AM.

49
00:03:29,580 --> 00:03:34,020
Immediately upon arrival, the planes are unloaded and their packages are put into the hub's

50
00:03:34,020 --> 00:03:35,840
automated sorting system.

51
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:40,260
Within only 15 minutes, each package arrives at a staging area for its next flight where

52
00:03:40,260 --> 00:03:42,300
it's loaded into containers.

53
00:03:42,300 --> 00:03:47,460
Planes therefore can start taking off again at 2 AM and continue to until 4 AM which means

54
00:03:47,460 --> 00:03:52,540
that everywhere in the US can have a FedEx plane arriving by 6 AM, but there are some

55
00:03:52,540 --> 00:03:57,440
destinations that don't ship enough packages to need a non-stop flight to Memphis.

56
00:03:57,440 --> 00:04:03,140
To get to small towns fast, FedEx runs flights in small propeller aircraft from the destinations

57
00:04:03,140 --> 00:04:04,820
of their larger jets.

58
00:04:04,820 --> 00:04:09,460
Presque Isle, Maine, for example, is far too small of a town at about 10,000 residents

59
00:04:09,460 --> 00:04:14,700
to fill a full-size plane so, every morning, whence the larger planes from Memphis arrive

60
00:04:14,700 --> 00:04:19,040
in Manchester, New Hampshire, and Portland, Maine, packages bound for Presque Isle are

61
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:22,420
sorted into smaller prop planes that continue north.

62
00:04:22,420 --> 00:04:27,740
With this system, even towns like Presque Isle get their packages by 9 AM as every spoke

63
00:04:27,740 --> 00:04:31,460
in the system essentially functions as a mini-hub.

64
00:04:31,460 --> 00:04:36,180
Packages are transferred from planes to smaller planes to trucks to reach their destination

65
00:04:36,180 --> 00:04:37,780
as fast as possible.

66
00:04:37,780 --> 00:04:42,980
Now, it's important to note that not every FedEx package runs through Memphis.

67
00:04:42,980 --> 00:04:47,540
That would be incredibly inefficient if a customer wanted to, for example, ship a package

68
00:04:47,540 --> 00:04:50,220
from Phoenix, Arizona to Seattle, Washington.

69
00:04:50,220 --> 00:04:54,900
While only 1,100 miles separate Seattle from Phoenix, a routing through Memphis would total

70
00:04:54,900 --> 00:04:58,300
over 3,000 miles and six hours in flight.

71
00:04:58,300 --> 00:05:02,660
The package would still make it overnight, but FedEx would be wasting fuel carrying that

72
00:05:02,660 --> 00:05:08,020
package an extra 1,900 miles so that's why they have secondary hubs.

73
00:05:08,020 --> 00:05:12,820
In this case, FedEx's Oakland hub has flights to both Phoenix and Seattle so the package

74
00:05:12,820 --> 00:05:16,460
would take a relatively efficient 1,300 mile routing.

75
00:05:16,460 --> 00:05:21,480
Memphis essentially serves as the backup hub in case there's not a more efficient routing.

76
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:25,980
The secondary hubs, such as Oakland, in general have flights to destinations that are already

77
00:05:25,980 --> 00:05:30,940
served by flights to Memphis, but the destinations from Oakland are high demand destinations

78
00:05:30,940 --> 00:05:36,300
that ship enough packages solely to the west coast to fill entire planes to Oakland.

79
00:05:36,300 --> 00:05:40,740
Some destinations, such as Albuquerque, New Mexico, ship enough packages to fill entire

80
00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:45,940
planes to Memphis, but not enough to fill flights to Oakland with west coast bound packages.

81
00:05:45,940 --> 00:05:50,100
So a package shipped from here to the west coast would likely take a rather inefficient

82
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:52,500
routing backtracking to Memphis.

83
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:57,140
But FedEx's most ingenious hub is here in Anchorage, Alaska.

84
00:05:57,140 --> 00:06:02,900
Anchorage, with fewer than 300,000 residents, is home to the fourth busiest cargo airport

85
00:06:02,900 --> 00:06:04,300
in the world.

86
00:06:04,300 --> 00:06:07,520
This is, once again, thanks to geography.

87
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:11,960
If you draw a straight line from FedEx's Memphis hub to the one in Osaka, taking into

88
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:16,600
account earth's curvature, it goes directly over Anchorage, Alaska.

89
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:21,200
This airport is just the perfect stopover points for flights from the US to Asia.

90
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:26,120
Now, dozens of cargo airlines operate in Anchorage but most of them just use the airport as a

91
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:28,640
refueling and crew swap spot.

92
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:33,000
Modern airplanes can fly non-stop from the contiguous United States to Asia, but doing

93
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:37,040
so requires taking more fuel which requires taking less cargo.

94
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:41,880
It's just cheaper to stop in Anchorage, but FedEx and UPS use the stop for something

95
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:43,720
else—sorting.

96
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:47,520
If FedEx wanted to maintain current shipping times without the Anchorage hub they would

97
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:51,800
likely have to run non-stop flights from each of their Asian hubs to each of their American

98
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:55,520
hubs, but they don't have the demand to fill this many planes.

99
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:59,540
Instead, they run flights from their Asian hubs to Anchorage then flights from Anchorage

100
00:06:59,540 --> 00:07:01,460
to many of their American hubs.

101
00:07:01,460 --> 00:07:05,680
While stopped in Anchorage, packages from Asia are processed through customs and sorted

102
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:09,000
to be put on the plane bound closest for their destination.

103
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:12,760
This helps cut down on shipping time and cost.

104
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:15,940
Shipping is an incredibly price-sensitive business.

105
00:07:15,940 --> 00:07:20,920
These courier companies rely on enormous contracts with retailers and, when some of these retailers

106
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:25,600
are shipping millions of packages per day, every cent matters.

107
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:30,980
In a lot of ways, however, the express shipping model is inherently expensive largely because

108
00:07:30,980 --> 00:07:35,640
of how couriers use their most expensive assets—planes.

109
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:40,400
So much is centered around those few sorting hours at the big hubs so FedEx's planes

110
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:44,480
all have to wait around to arrive at the exact right moment.

111
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:49,540
Some FedEx hubs, such as Memphis, do sort packages during the day, but the overwhelming

112
00:07:49,540 --> 00:07:52,360
majority of their business happens overnight.

113
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:57,440
FedEx's flight from Memphis to Oklahoma City, for example, leaves at 4am and arrives

114
00:07:57,440 --> 00:08:04,240
at 5.20am, but then the plane waits around until 10.10pm to fly back to Memphis.

115
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:09,780
That's over 17 hours sitting in Oklahoma City and, on that route, the plane is only

116
00:08:09,780 --> 00:08:12,680
flying for about two hours per day.

117
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:17,720
Meanwhile, commercial airlines regularly fly their planes for more than 12 hours per day

118
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:21,680
meaning that they have six times higher aircraft utilization.

119
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:26,560
FedEx would never be profitable if they bought all new, multi-hundred million dollar aircraft

120
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:29,960
to use for mere hours per day, so they don't.

121
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:35,200
Overwhelmingly, FedEx and other cargo airlines use old aircraft at the end of their lives.

122
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:40,920
You'll almost never see Airbus A300s flying for passenger airlines anymore, yet FedEx,

123
00:08:40,920 --> 00:08:45,720
UPS, and DHL collectively own hundreds of them because they're cheap.

124
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:49,500
They didn't spend much purchasing these aircraft so they don't have to worry about

125
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:52,160
using them enough to offset their cost.

126
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:58,300
UPS does have some brand new 747-800 aircraft which are highly efficient, but they specifically

127
00:08:58,300 --> 00:09:02,740
schedule these planes on their longest routes so that they can recuperate their high purchase

128
00:09:02,740 --> 00:09:05,140
price through lower fuel costs.

129
00:09:05,140 --> 00:09:09,980
With older aircraft, fuel costs might be higher since the planes are less efficient, but overall

130
00:09:09,980 --> 00:09:14,780
it's worth it since it allows FedEx to profitably leave their planes sitting for all but a few

131
00:09:14,780 --> 00:09:16,360
hours each day.

132
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:21,300
Some passenger airlines, such as Legion Airlines in the US, use the same strategy purchasing

133
00:09:21,300 --> 00:09:25,900
cheaper planes to allow them to fly fewer hours per day profitably and it's now a

134
00:09:25,900 --> 00:09:28,660
tested and proven business strategy.

135
00:09:28,660 --> 00:09:33,020
Express Shipping is one of those businesses that requires enormous networks to make work

136
00:09:33,020 --> 00:09:35,780
which is why you don't see small shipping companies.

137
00:09:35,780 --> 00:09:40,900
It's almost impossible to get started in this business unless, of course, you can make

138
00:09:40,900 --> 00:09:42,380
your own demand.

139
00:09:42,380 --> 00:09:47,540
Amazon, which ships more than a million packages per day, is getting into the delivery business.

140
00:09:47,540 --> 00:09:52,900
They've established a fleet of 32 aircraft and are building out their logistics network.

141
00:09:52,900 --> 00:09:58,380
In shipping so many packages, Amazon is operating at a scale where they can profit by taking

142
00:09:58,380 --> 00:10:00,700
the shipping companies out of the equation.

143
00:10:00,700 --> 00:10:06,660
FedEx, UPS, and DHL, meanwhile, are continuously focusing on further increasing the efficiency

144
00:10:06,660 --> 00:10:11,700
of their networks since in this business more than any, time is money.

145
00:10:11,700 --> 00:10:15,660
As you may have noticed, Wendover Productions has a new logo and with that I've redesigned

146
00:10:15,660 --> 00:10:17,380
the website with Squarespace.

147
00:10:17,380 --> 00:10:21,640
To be honest, I hadn't used the website builder in a while, but this process reminded

148
00:10:21,640 --> 00:10:24,360
me of why I'm such a fan of Squarespace.

149
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:28,960
It was super simple to completely overhaul the site and, in my opinion, it looks great.

150
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:34,400
I didn't have any issues, but if you ever do they have award-winning 24-7 customer support

151
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:36,840
that I have used in the past and can vouch for.

152
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:41,340
If you run a business, a YouTube channel, a podcast, or anything else you want to have

153
00:10:41,340 --> 00:10:46,080
a professional web presence like I do with my site since that's how people find you

154
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:53,040
and you can get started building your website with Squarespace for 10% off at squarespace.com.com.

155
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:56,760
Squarespace is a great supporter of the show so make sure to show them your appreciation

156
00:10:56,760 --> 00:11:01,200
by at least checking them out at squarespace.com.com.

157
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:04,800
And just one more thing, if you're like me and the first reaction you had to seeing

158
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:09,140
this new logo is wanting a t-shirt of it, you're in luck because they're now available

159
00:11:09,140 --> 00:11:11,360
