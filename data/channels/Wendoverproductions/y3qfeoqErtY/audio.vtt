00:08.740 --> 00:14.940
Overnight shipping is an absolute masterpiece of logistics that happens every single night.

00:14.940 --> 00:19.840
It may not be cheap, but you can get a package shipped from Miami, Florida on a Monday to

00:19.840 --> 00:23.560
Anchorage, Alaska by 8.30am on Tuesday.

00:23.560 --> 00:28.100
In fact, you can even ship a package, for example, from Edinburgh, Scotland on a Tuesday

00:28.100 --> 00:32.900
and have the package arrive in Anchorage, Alaska by 9.00am on Wednesday.

00:32.900 --> 00:37.820
The speed and efficiency of these worldwide delivery networks is mind-blowing and it all

00:37.820 --> 00:39.900
happens while we sleep.

00:39.900 --> 00:45.100
The three major consumer courier companies are FedEx, DHL, and UPS and each of them is

00:45.100 --> 00:46.980
as impressive as the last.

00:46.980 --> 00:52.100
FedEx has more planes than Emirates, Etihad, and Qatar Airways combined, DHL delivers to

00:52.100 --> 00:56.920
every country in the world including North Korea, and UPS flies to more than double as

00:56.920 --> 01:00.160
many destinations as the largest passenger airline.

01:00.160 --> 01:04.640
Each has a global network that allows for lightning fast shipping at relatively low

01:04.640 --> 01:05.720
prices.

01:05.720 --> 01:11.080
Behind all this speed are enormous air networks that connect the entire world daily.

01:11.080 --> 01:16.060
Each of these three operates hundreds of flights nightly, but FedEx is the best example since

01:16.060 --> 01:20.040
their operations make them the largest cargo airline in the world.

01:20.040 --> 01:26.720
They have 650 planes flying to 400 destinations carrying 6 million packages every single day

01:26.720 --> 01:31.760
and the vast majority of these flights operate to or from one of their hub airports.

01:31.760 --> 01:36.320
FedEx's hub airports are spread out all across the world and serve as sorting points

01:36.320 --> 01:39.360
where packages are transferred from one plane to another.

01:39.360 --> 01:45.480
They have hubs in Singapore, Guangzhou, Shanghai, Seoul, Osaka, Anchorage, Oakland, Dallas,

01:45.480 --> 01:51.760
Indianapolis, Greensboro, Miami, Newark, Toronto, Paris, Cologne, Milan, and Dubai, but the

01:51.760 --> 01:57.640
most important hub of all is the one in Memphis, Tennessee because that's their super hub.

01:57.640 --> 02:03.520
Memphis is not a huge city, only about 650,000 people live there, but the reason FedEx centers

02:03.520 --> 02:07.960
their worldwide operations in this city is because of its location.

02:07.960 --> 02:12.640
Memphis is not actually in the geographic center of the US as might make sense, but

02:12.640 --> 02:14.280
it is central.

02:14.280 --> 02:19.440
You see only about 200 miles away in Wright County, Missouri is the mean population center

02:19.440 --> 02:20.780
of the US.

02:20.780 --> 02:25.540
This is the average location of every resident in the US meaning that the FedEx super hub

02:25.540 --> 02:30.740
in Memphis is the best location to reach the most people in the shortest amount of time.

02:30.740 --> 02:36.380
For similar reasons, UPS has their equivalent global hub, Worldport, nearby in Louisville,

02:36.380 --> 02:37.380
Kentucky.

02:37.380 --> 02:43.020
The scale of FedEx and UPS's operations in these relatively small cities is staggering.

02:43.020 --> 02:47.660
This is the size of the commercial terminal at Memphis airport while this is the size

02:47.660 --> 02:49.220
of FedEx's super hub.

02:49.220 --> 02:53.500
The difference at Louisville airport is even more pronounced where this is the commercial

02:53.500 --> 02:56.740
terminal and this is UPS's Worldport.

02:56.740 --> 03:01.640
You can't even fly to the west coast non-stop on a commercial airline from Louisville and

03:01.640 --> 03:06.620
yet UPS flies from this small city to five different continents.

03:06.620 --> 03:11.700
FedEx's operations in Memphis, meanwhile, make this airport the second busiest cargo

03:11.700 --> 03:18.060
airport in the world above those of enormous cities like Tokyo, Paris, Dubai, Shanghai,

03:18.060 --> 03:20.360
and falling short only to Hong Kong.

03:20.360 --> 03:25.820
How the FedEx super hub really works is that every night, about 150 planes fly in from

03:25.820 --> 03:29.580
all around the world between the hours of 10 PM and 1 AM.

03:29.580 --> 03:34.020
Immediately upon arrival, the planes are unloaded and their packages are put into the hub's

03:34.020 --> 03:35.840
automated sorting system.

03:35.840 --> 03:40.260
Within only 15 minutes, each package arrives at a staging area for its next flight where

03:40.260 --> 03:42.300
it's loaded into containers.

03:42.300 --> 03:47.460
Planes therefore can start taking off again at 2 AM and continue to until 4 AM which means

03:47.460 --> 03:52.540
that everywhere in the US can have a FedEx plane arriving by 6 AM, but there are some

03:52.540 --> 03:57.440
destinations that don't ship enough packages to need a non-stop flight to Memphis.

03:57.440 --> 04:03.140
To get to small towns fast, FedEx runs flights in small propeller aircraft from the destinations

04:03.140 --> 04:04.820
of their larger jets.

04:04.820 --> 04:09.460
Presque Isle, Maine, for example, is far too small of a town at about 10,000 residents

04:09.460 --> 04:14.700
to fill a full-size plane so, every morning, whence the larger planes from Memphis arrive

04:14.700 --> 04:19.040
in Manchester, New Hampshire, and Portland, Maine, packages bound for Presque Isle are

04:19.040 --> 04:22.420
sorted into smaller prop planes that continue north.

04:22.420 --> 04:27.740
With this system, even towns like Presque Isle get their packages by 9 AM as every spoke

04:27.740 --> 04:31.460
in the system essentially functions as a mini-hub.

04:31.460 --> 04:36.180
Packages are transferred from planes to smaller planes to trucks to reach their destination

04:36.180 --> 04:37.780
as fast as possible.

04:37.780 --> 04:42.980
Now, it's important to note that not every FedEx package runs through Memphis.

04:42.980 --> 04:47.540
That would be incredibly inefficient if a customer wanted to, for example, ship a package

04:47.540 --> 04:50.220
from Phoenix, Arizona to Seattle, Washington.

04:50.220 --> 04:54.900
While only 1,100 miles separate Seattle from Phoenix, a routing through Memphis would total

04:54.900 --> 04:58.300
over 3,000 miles and six hours in flight.

04:58.300 --> 05:02.660
The package would still make it overnight, but FedEx would be wasting fuel carrying that

05:02.660 --> 05:08.020
package an extra 1,900 miles so that's why they have secondary hubs.

05:08.020 --> 05:12.820
In this case, FedEx's Oakland hub has flights to both Phoenix and Seattle so the package

05:12.820 --> 05:16.460
would take a relatively efficient 1,300 mile routing.

05:16.460 --> 05:21.480
Memphis essentially serves as the backup hub in case there's not a more efficient routing.

05:21.480 --> 05:25.980
The secondary hubs, such as Oakland, in general have flights to destinations that are already

05:25.980 --> 05:30.940
served by flights to Memphis, but the destinations from Oakland are high demand destinations

05:30.940 --> 05:36.300
that ship enough packages solely to the west coast to fill entire planes to Oakland.

05:36.300 --> 05:40.740
Some destinations, such as Albuquerque, New Mexico, ship enough packages to fill entire

05:40.740 --> 05:45.940
planes to Memphis, but not enough to fill flights to Oakland with west coast bound packages.

05:45.940 --> 05:50.100
So a package shipped from here to the west coast would likely take a rather inefficient

05:50.100 --> 05:52.500
routing backtracking to Memphis.

05:52.500 --> 05:57.140
But FedEx's most ingenious hub is here in Anchorage, Alaska.

05:57.140 --> 06:02.900
Anchorage, with fewer than 300,000 residents, is home to the fourth busiest cargo airport

06:02.900 --> 06:04.300
in the world.

06:04.300 --> 06:07.520
This is, once again, thanks to geography.

06:07.520 --> 06:11.960
If you draw a straight line from FedEx's Memphis hub to the one in Osaka, taking into

06:11.960 --> 06:16.600
account earth's curvature, it goes directly over Anchorage, Alaska.

06:16.600 --> 06:21.200
This airport is just the perfect stopover points for flights from the US to Asia.

06:21.200 --> 06:26.120
Now, dozens of cargo airlines operate in Anchorage but most of them just use the airport as a

06:26.120 --> 06:28.640
refueling and crew swap spot.

06:28.640 --> 06:33.000
Modern airplanes can fly non-stop from the contiguous United States to Asia, but doing

06:33.000 --> 06:37.040
so requires taking more fuel which requires taking less cargo.

06:37.040 --> 06:41.880
It's just cheaper to stop in Anchorage, but FedEx and UPS use the stop for something

06:41.880 --> 06:43.720
elseâ€”sorting.

06:43.720 --> 06:47.520
If FedEx wanted to maintain current shipping times without the Anchorage hub they would

06:47.520 --> 06:51.800
likely have to run non-stop flights from each of their Asian hubs to each of their American

06:51.800 --> 06:55.520
hubs, but they don't have the demand to fill this many planes.

06:55.520 --> 06:59.540
Instead, they run flights from their Asian hubs to Anchorage then flights from Anchorage

06:59.540 --> 07:01.460
to many of their American hubs.

07:01.460 --> 07:05.680
While stopped in Anchorage, packages from Asia are processed through customs and sorted

07:05.680 --> 07:09.000
to be put on the plane bound closest for their destination.

07:09.000 --> 07:12.760
This helps cut down on shipping time and cost.

07:12.760 --> 07:15.940
Shipping is an incredibly price-sensitive business.

07:15.940 --> 07:20.920
These courier companies rely on enormous contracts with retailers and, when some of these retailers

07:20.920 --> 07:25.600
are shipping millions of packages per day, every cent matters.

07:25.600 --> 07:30.980
In a lot of ways, however, the express shipping model is inherently expensive largely because

07:30.980 --> 07:35.640
of how couriers use their most expensive assetsâ€”planes.

07:35.640 --> 07:40.400
So much is centered around those few sorting hours at the big hubs so FedEx's planes

07:40.400 --> 07:44.480
all have to wait around to arrive at the exact right moment.

07:44.480 --> 07:49.540
Some FedEx hubs, such as Memphis, do sort packages during the day, but the overwhelming

07:49.540 --> 07:52.360
majority of their business happens overnight.

07:52.360 --> 07:57.440
FedEx's flight from Memphis to Oklahoma City, for example, leaves at 4am and arrives

07:57.440 --> 08:04.240
at 5.20am, but then the plane waits around until 10.10pm to fly back to Memphis.

08:04.240 --> 08:09.780
That's over 17 hours sitting in Oklahoma City and, on that route, the plane is only

08:09.780 --> 08:12.680
flying for about two hours per day.

08:12.680 --> 08:17.720
Meanwhile, commercial airlines regularly fly their planes for more than 12 hours per day

08:17.720 --> 08:21.680
meaning that they have six times higher aircraft utilization.

08:21.680 --> 08:26.560
FedEx would never be profitable if they bought all new, multi-hundred million dollar aircraft

08:26.560 --> 08:29.960
to use for mere hours per day, so they don't.

08:29.960 --> 08:35.200
Overwhelmingly, FedEx and other cargo airlines use old aircraft at the end of their lives.

08:35.200 --> 08:40.920
You'll almost never see Airbus A300s flying for passenger airlines anymore, yet FedEx,

08:40.920 --> 08:45.720
UPS, and DHL collectively own hundreds of them because they're cheap.

08:45.720 --> 08:49.500
They didn't spend much purchasing these aircraft so they don't have to worry about

08:49.500 --> 08:52.160
using them enough to offset their cost.

08:52.160 --> 08:58.300
UPS does have some brand new 747-800 aircraft which are highly efficient, but they specifically

08:58.300 --> 09:02.740
schedule these planes on their longest routes so that they can recuperate their high purchase

09:02.740 --> 09:05.140
price through lower fuel costs.

09:05.140 --> 09:09.980
With older aircraft, fuel costs might be higher since the planes are less efficient, but overall

09:09.980 --> 09:14.780
it's worth it since it allows FedEx to profitably leave their planes sitting for all but a few

09:14.780 --> 09:16.360
hours each day.

09:16.360 --> 09:21.300
Some passenger airlines, such as Legion Airlines in the US, use the same strategy purchasing

09:21.300 --> 09:25.900
cheaper planes to allow them to fly fewer hours per day profitably and it's now a

09:25.900 --> 09:28.660
tested and proven business strategy.

09:28.660 --> 09:33.020
Express Shipping is one of those businesses that requires enormous networks to make work

09:33.020 --> 09:35.780
which is why you don't see small shipping companies.

09:35.780 --> 09:40.900
It's almost impossible to get started in this business unless, of course, you can make

09:40.900 --> 09:42.380
your own demand.

09:42.380 --> 09:47.540
Amazon, which ships more than a million packages per day, is getting into the delivery business.

09:47.540 --> 09:52.900
They've established a fleet of 32 aircraft and are building out their logistics network.

09:52.900 --> 09:58.380
In shipping so many packages, Amazon is operating at a scale where they can profit by taking

09:58.380 --> 10:00.700
the shipping companies out of the equation.

10:00.700 --> 10:06.660
FedEx, UPS, and DHL, meanwhile, are continuously focusing on further increasing the efficiency

10:06.660 --> 10:11.700
of their networks since in this business more than any, time is money.

10:11.700 --> 10:15.660
As you may have noticed, Wendover Productions has a new logo and with that I've redesigned

10:15.660 --> 10:17.380
the website with Squarespace.

10:17.380 --> 10:21.640
To be honest, I hadn't used the website builder in a while, but this process reminded

10:21.640 --> 10:24.360
me of why I'm such a fan of Squarespace.

10:24.360 --> 10:28.960
It was super simple to completely overhaul the site and, in my opinion, it looks great.

10:28.960 --> 10:34.400
I didn't have any issues, but if you ever do they have award-winning 24-7 customer support

10:34.400 --> 10:36.840
that I have used in the past and can vouch for.

10:36.840 --> 10:41.340
If you run a business, a YouTube channel, a podcast, or anything else you want to have

10:41.340 --> 10:46.080
a professional web presence like I do with my site since that's how people find you

10:46.080 --> 10:53.040
and you can get started building your website with Squarespace for 10% off at squarespace.com.com.

10:53.040 --> 10:56.760
Squarespace is a great supporter of the show so make sure to show them your appreciation

10:56.760 --> 11:01.200
by at least checking them out at squarespace.com.com.

11:01.200 --> 11:04.800
And just one more thing, if you're like me and the first reaction you had to seeing

11:04.800 --> 11:09.140
this new logo is wanting a t-shirt of it, you're in luck because they're now available

11:09.140 --> 11:11.360
for pre-order at DFTBA.

11:11.360 --> 11:12.720
