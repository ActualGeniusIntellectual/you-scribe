1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,940
This is lithium.

2
00:00:01,940 --> 00:00:04,720
Pretty soon, we're going to need a lot of it.

3
00:00:04,720 --> 00:00:08,800
Lithium is a useful metal—it spends its entire existence trying to get rid of its

4
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:15,720
one outer electron but, crucially, this reaction can be both controlled and reversed.

5
00:00:15,720 --> 00:00:20,200
That means, properly configured, the metal can discharge energy when needed, take in

6
00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:23,520
more energy, and then discharge that energy.

7
00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:26,120
Essentially, it can act as a battery.

8
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:30,960
It's only been a few decades since lithium-ion batteries reached commercial feasibility,

9
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:34,820
but in that time, they have become the power source of choice for portable electronics

10
00:00:34,820 --> 00:00:38,080
thanks to their perfect blend of safety and lightness.

11
00:00:38,080 --> 00:00:43,400
However, the latest major tech boom, the latest infatuation of Silicon Valley and Wall Street

12
00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:50,040
alike, is centered around the largest consumer electronics product to date—electric vehicles.

13
00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:53,120
And pretty soon, we're going to need a lot of them.

14
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:58,260
The UK, for example, has committed to banning internal combustion car sales by 2030.

15
00:00:58,260 --> 00:01:04,720
To replace its 31.5 million vehicles, about 236,000 metric tons of lithium carbonate are

16
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:05,720
needed.

17
00:01:05,720 --> 00:01:10,720
To produce 236,000 metric tons of lithium carbonate, every lithium mine in the world

18
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:15,180
would have to devote its output to this one use for nine months, and there are a whole

19
00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:19,720
lot more countries, a whole lot more lithium applications, and a whole lot more growth

20
00:01:19,720 --> 00:01:20,720
in the forecast.

21
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:25,600
While the industry and its issues may be complex, the way in which battery-grade lithium is

22
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:27,920
produced is not.

23
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:32,880
Four countries dominate the industry—Argentina, Chile, Australia, and China combined account

24
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:35,580
for 92% of the globe's production.

25
00:01:35,580 --> 00:01:39,360
The metal is extracted from the ground at massive sites like the Greenbushes Mine in

26
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:43,400
Western Australia, which is the world's largest hard-rock lithium mine.

27
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:47,080
The site was selected due to the abundance of spodumene in the area, which is a mineral

28
00:01:47,080 --> 00:01:50,040
that contains large concentrations of lithium.

29
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:53,520
Once the raw material is extracted from the ground, it's transported two and a half

30
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:58,040
hours north to the Quinana lithium plant near Perth—a facility a majority owned and operated

31
00:01:58,040 --> 00:02:02,640
by a Chinese company, Tianqi Lithium, which is responsible for almost half of the world's

32
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:04,080
production of the metal.

33
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:08,600
Once refined, lithium hydroxide and other compounds are sold to battery manufacturers,

34
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:13,720
which in about three-quarters of the cases means one of three companies—LG Chem, CATL,

35
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:15,080
or Panasonic.

36
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:18,400
The problem, however, is the world's solution.

37
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:23,480
In addition to the UK, Iceland, Belgium, the Netherlands, Germany, Denmark, Norway, Sweden,

38
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:27,860
Israel, Singapore, and South Korea have each committed to banning the sale of internal

39
00:02:27,860 --> 00:02:31,220
combustion passenger vehicles within the next decade.

40
00:02:31,220 --> 00:02:35,960
Adding up their annual passenger vehicle sales numbers from 2019, that means the absolute

41
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:41,680
base-case demand for EVs a decade from now will be $9.5 million per year.

42
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:45,760
Just to reach that, EV production would have to quintuple, but even the most conservative

43
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:52,000
forecasters don't dare tread anywhere close to a number as low as $9.5 million in 2032.

44
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,740
The market is waking up to what this means for lithium demand.

45
00:02:55,740 --> 00:03:01,160
Across 2021, seaborne lithium prices rose from around $8,000 per metric ton to over

46
00:03:01,160 --> 00:03:07,960
$30,000—a 400% rise in a mere 12 months, and lithium is hardly the only crucial metal

47
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:11,760
for lithium-ion battery production—it's just the one in the name.

48
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:16,000
Cobalt and nickel are also critical to most commercially available versions of these batteries,

49
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,280
and the situation is hardly different with them.

50
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:24,720
Cobalt prices doubled across 2021, while nickel rose to its highest price in a decade.

51
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:30,480
So, the world needs a lot more metals, but right now, it's hard to believe the world's

52
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:31,980
going to get them.

53
00:03:31,980 --> 00:03:37,720
The biggest hurdle the industry faces is exemplified here—Thacker Pass, Nevada.

54
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:42,320
Thacker Pass is located in one of the most sparsely populated areas of the country—it's

55
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:47,080
a half-hour's drive to the nearest store, an hour to the nearest supermarket, and three

56
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:48,920
to the nearest Starbucks.

57
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:53,320
The few roads that exist in the area are lucky to see a few cars an hour, traveling to and

58
00:03:53,320 --> 00:03:57,880
from the various remote farms, ranches, and communities dotting northern Nevada.

59
00:03:57,880 --> 00:04:02,680
That could soon change, though—250 miles, or 400 kilometers to the south, is the Silver

60
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:04,200
Peak Lithium Mine.

61
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:08,400
This is the nation's only currently operating major lithium mine, despite the fact that

62
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:13,480
the US is one of the largest EV markets and home to the world's largest EV manufacturer.

63
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:19,080
China, also a major EV market home to major EV manufacturers, has made significant headway

64
00:04:19,080 --> 00:04:23,040
in building up its domestic lithium production capacity, and the country's companies also

65
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:27,280
have significant presences at the world's other major lithium production sites.

66
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:30,800
This has come to concern those in charge in the US.

67
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:36,760
Therefore, sites are set on Thacker Pass, home to the US's largest lithium deposit.

68
00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:41,760
The site could single-handedly propel the US into the ranks of major lithium producers,

69
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:45,780
but getting a mine up and running there has proved difficult.

70
00:04:45,780 --> 00:04:50,720
The way in which major lithium deposits are distributed across the world is rather cruel.

71
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:55,480
Overwhelmingly, they're located in arid regions with little water availability, like

72
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:56,680
Nevada.

73
00:04:56,680 --> 00:05:01,640
Thacker Pass receives less than 10 inches or 25 centimeters of rain a year.

74
00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:07,200
However, the extraction and processing of lithium requires enormous quantities of water.

75
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:13,240
It's expected that operations at the proposed Thacker Pass lithium mine would require 3,224

76
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:20,520
gallons or 12,204 liters of water per minute—roughly equivalent to the contents of a backyard above-ground

77
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:21,520
pool.

78
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:24,880
That water would be used to pump into the ground as part of the extraction process,

79
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:29,280
during refinement, and to conduct necessary dust control at the site.

80
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:33,200
To get this water, the mine would have to pump it out of the ground using wells, but

81
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:38,560
every acre-foot of water in the area is strictly allocated, given the degree of scarcity.

82
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:43,340
So, the mine has to buy up water rights from others in order to gain the legal right to

83
00:05:43,340 --> 00:05:44,440
use it.

84
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:49,080
What that means, however, is that there's a direct trade-off between one use and another,

85
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:54,160
and in this case, the other use is predominantly ranching and farming—two key tenants to

86
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:55,160
the local economy.

87
00:05:55,160 --> 00:06:00,040
In addition, there's a chance the project could do far more to further the inaccessibility

88
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:02,040
of water in northern Nevada.

89
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:05,800
The US Bureau of Land Management's Environmental Impact Study for the project found that it

90
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:10,740
presented the distinct possibility of leaking unacceptable levels of arsenic into the area's

91
00:06:10,740 --> 00:06:15,180
groundwater table, which could take the entire region's water supply offline for hundreds

92
00:06:15,180 --> 00:06:16,180
of years.

93
00:06:16,180 --> 00:06:20,980
In an area where the availability of water undergirds almost all economic activity, that

94
00:06:20,980 --> 00:06:23,840
has people seriously concerned.

95
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:26,800
The issues only compound on top of that.

96
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:31,600
As Thacker Pass is, of course, a mountain pass, it acts as a wildlife corridor between

97
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:35,840
the Double H and Montana Mountains—two biodiversity hotspots.

98
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:40,480
Therefore, the Environmental Impact Study found the project likely to destroy or deteriorate

99
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:45,400
thousands of acres of habitat used by the pronghorn antelope, sage-grouse, golden eagle,

100
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:47,120
and other unique species.

101
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:51,960
For interrelated reasons, the project also has a number of local indigenous tribes concerned—the

102
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:55,740
most vocal of which is the Fort McDermott Paiute and Shoshone Tribe.

103
00:06:55,740 --> 00:06:59,600
They say that during the era of American soldiers rounding up and shipping indigenous people

104
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:03,800
off to reservations, two of the tribe's families hid out in the shelter Thacker Pass

105
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:08,840
provided, so they directly attribute the continued existence of their tribe to the area.

106
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:13,660
In addition, they consider the pass a sacred site, in part because of a historic massacre,

107
00:07:13,660 --> 00:07:15,060
they say, occurred there.

108
00:07:15,060 --> 00:07:19,480
This assertion, however, was directly challenged in a court case related to the mine project,

109
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:22,760
and the judge rejected the claim, citing a lack of evidence.

110
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:26,440
To add to their opposition, the tribe put forward evidence linking the development of

111
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:31,020
similar resource extraction projects, which are predominantly staffed by men, to increases

112
00:07:31,020 --> 00:07:34,840
in the rape and murder of indigenous women in nearby areas.

113
00:07:34,840 --> 00:07:39,560
Even just looking at these few headline issues, it becomes clear that the Thacker Pass Lithium

114
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:45,200
Mine Project is mired in a nearly insurmountable web of controversy and conflict, and it's

115
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:47,400
hardly alone in that status.

116
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:51,500
Much of the evidence opponents to the Thacker Pass mine have put forward is based on real-world

117
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:56,360
experiences in the Lithium Triangle—the nexus between Chile, Argentina, and Bolivia

118
00:07:56,360 --> 00:07:59,920
that host some of the world's most productive lithium production facilities.

119
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:04,500
An area in a similar situation—a remote, arid landscape punctuated by small communities

120
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:08,480
home to a historically oppressed indigenous population—the Lithium Triangle has seen

121
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:14,240
an economic boon, but it's come at the cost of environmental and cultural devastation.

122
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:17,720
Just as the issues are not confined to one geography, they're not even confined to

123
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:23,040
lithium alone—some 70% of the world's cobalt, a crucial component to current battery

124
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:27,400
tech, comes from the Democratic Republic of the Congo—the eighth poorest country in

125
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:29,680
the world, according to World Bank figures.

126
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:34,140
While a majority of the cobalt mining is conducted by large mining companies with often shaky

127
00:08:34,140 --> 00:08:39,060
safety and human rights records, a concerningly large minority is accomplished through what's

128
00:08:39,060 --> 00:08:43,800
referred to as artisanal mining—a term defining the illegal, informal practice of

129
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:48,020
individuals mining cobalt by themselves and selling it on to shady middlemen.

130
00:08:48,020 --> 00:08:52,700
The complete lack of safety standards or regulations in the sector means child labor and deadly

131
00:08:52,700 --> 00:08:55,100
mine collapses are rampant.

132
00:08:55,100 --> 00:08:59,380
For those that aren't directly injured or killed on the job, long-term exposure to cobalt

133
00:08:59,380 --> 00:09:03,560
mines has been linked to significant health effects later in life, and fatal birth defects

134
00:09:03,560 --> 00:09:05,260
for children in the region.

135
00:09:05,260 --> 00:09:08,860
Altogether, there's almost no such thing as ethical cobalt.

136
00:09:08,860 --> 00:09:12,140
There's also almost no such thing as green lithium.

137
00:09:12,140 --> 00:09:16,740
There's little appetite anywhere to increasing lithium mining in the places where it's

138
00:09:16,740 --> 00:09:21,300
accessible, and little progress has been made in the DRC in making cobalt mining less socially

139
00:09:21,300 --> 00:09:22,300
disastrous.

140
00:09:22,300 --> 00:09:28,500
As demand for EVs and their batteries increases, getting more cobalt and lithium will be incredibly

141
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:29,500
difficult.

142
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:34,560
However, on top of that, getting more cobalt and lithium that's more ethical and green,

143
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:38,760
or even as ethical and green, will be next to impossible.

144
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:43,660
But to decarbonize driving, solutions must be found.

145
00:09:43,660 --> 00:09:48,060
One option, rather than finding more raw materials, is to need less of them.

146
00:09:48,060 --> 00:09:52,220
Of course, the way to do that is by making batteries better.

147
00:09:52,220 --> 00:09:56,580
The most promising short-term innovation that could fulfill that mission is solid-state

148
00:09:56,580 --> 00:09:58,020
batteries.

149
00:09:58,020 --> 00:10:02,880
Whereas traditional EV batteries have a liquidy, viscous lithium-based electrolyte, solid-state

150
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:08,560
batteries rather use a solid, metal composition as their ion transport mechanism.

151
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:12,320
This switch has a number of benefits, including a higher safety profile that reduces the risk

152
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:16,940
of fire, and therefore reduces the need for expensive safety features.

153
00:10:16,940 --> 00:10:20,920
Solid-state batteries can also be made without cobalt or nickel, which eliminates two problematic

154
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:24,200
and costly necessities in current battery tech.

155
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:29,100
Most significant, however, is solid-state batteries' higher energy density.

156
00:10:29,100 --> 00:10:33,920
Several lithium-ion compositions used in EV battery packs store about 114 watt-hours

157
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:37,740
of energy per pound, or 250 per kilogram.

158
00:10:37,740 --> 00:10:42,780
That means one pound of battery could move a Tesla Model 3, for example, 0.4 miles or

159
00:10:42,780 --> 00:10:44,700
1 kilogram 1.3 kilometers.

160
00:10:44,700 --> 00:10:49,780
Meanwhile, it's expected that solid-state batteries will be able to store between 175

161
00:10:49,780 --> 00:10:55,740
and 225 watt-hours per pound, or 400 to 500 per kilogram—essentially doubling battery

162
00:10:55,740 --> 00:10:56,780
density.

163
00:10:56,780 --> 00:11:00,480
That means Tesla could halve the weight of their half-ton battery pack, and not only

164
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:04,960
keep range the same, but increase it as the car would no longer need to carry the rest

165
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:06,880
of the weight of the battery pack.

166
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:11,940
On top of all those benefits, experts believe that, at scale, production costs of solid-state

167
00:11:11,940 --> 00:11:15,940
batteries could be even less than the current cheapest lithium-ion batteries.

168
00:11:15,940 --> 00:11:18,920
However, the issue is getting to that scale.

169
00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:24,100
Battery production needs to occur at absolutely massive quantities to reach cost competitiveness—an

170
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:27,780
assertion backed up by the industry's current effective triopoly.

171
00:11:27,780 --> 00:11:31,980
The process of working down this cost curve is long as there are few applications where

172
00:11:31,980 --> 00:11:36,700
battery weight matters as much as with EVs, and EVs won't switch to solid-state batteries

173
00:11:36,700 --> 00:11:40,420
until their cost is competitive, but their cost will only become competitive when the

174
00:11:40,420 --> 00:11:44,340
industry reaches a production capacity that only EVs can provide.

175
00:11:44,340 --> 00:11:48,620
So, the industry has to wait for some level of scale to occur through niche solid-state

176
00:11:48,620 --> 00:11:53,460
battery applications in medical devices, race cars, and fighter jets, then wait for consumer

177
00:11:53,460 --> 00:11:57,100
electronics to realize the weight savings or battery life benefits the innovation could

178
00:11:57,100 --> 00:12:01,420
provide, then wait for the highest-end EVs to incorporate the technology in order to

179
00:12:01,420 --> 00:12:05,940
offer super-long ranges as a luxury, before solid-state batteries can finally reach a

180
00:12:05,940 --> 00:12:09,840
cost that would allow them to permeate into what will be by then the large segment of

181
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:11,840
everyday EVs.

182
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:16,380
Most estimates place that enticing end goal more than a decade away.

183
00:12:16,380 --> 00:12:20,640
Even if the solid-state battery transition reaches fruition earlier, the world will still

184
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:24,400
need a whole lot more lithium.

185
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:29,440
Far from the potential environmental disaster at Thacker Pass is an existing environmental

186
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:32,080
disaster—the Salton Sea.

187
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:37,320
A century ago, Colorado River floodwaters breached through an irrigation canal and accumulated,

188
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:43,120
over years, in the Imperial Valley's geographic low point, 236 feet or 72 meters below sea

189
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:44,120
level.

190
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:48,560
That massive puddle still exists today, but some of the water has slowly evaporated through

191
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:53,320
time, leaving an even saltier, dirtier accumulation of water.

192
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:57,560
Thousands more feet below, however, are a number of underground volcanoes that superheat

193
00:12:57,560 --> 00:13:00,000
water to hundreds of degrees.

194
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:04,120
If one brings that water to the surface, the pressure change leads to it transforming into

195
00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:09,520
steam, and steam, of course, is what most power plants use to drive turbines.

196
00:13:09,520 --> 00:13:13,960
Traditional power plants use coal or natural gas to heat water up into steam, but this

197
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:17,040
steam is created by the earth—meaning it's carbon-free.

198
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:21,480
That's why Berkshire Hathaway Energy has built ten geothermal energy plants in the

199
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:27,160
area, but crucially, this superheated water is filled with something else—lithium.

200
00:13:27,160 --> 00:13:31,920
Therefore, these geothermal plants are planning on adding an extra step in their process to

201
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:34,760
extract lithium from the briny steam they use.

202
00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:39,400
Now, there are certainly significant technological hurdles that stand between now and a future

203
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:43,280
of commercially competitive lithium production at the Salton Sea, especially as the metal

204
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:48,520
only represents a tiny portion of the slurry of materials found in the water, but the lithium

205
00:13:48,520 --> 00:13:50,200
is there.

206
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:53,920
Berkshire Hathaway Energy, as the largest existing energy company working around the

207
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:58,420
Salton Sea, is leading the charge thanks in part to a sizable federal grant, and expects

208
00:13:58,420 --> 00:14:02,440
to have its demonstration facility up and running later in 2022.

209
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:05,880
A number of other competitors have already started developing their lithium extraction

210
00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:11,020
plays around the Salton Sea, meaning America's first lithium boomtown might already be a

211
00:14:11,020 --> 00:14:13,360
foregone conclusion.

212
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:18,180
These are the kind of solutions needed as the world transitions to electric mobility.

213
00:14:18,180 --> 00:14:22,380
Electric vehicles, due to their reliance on batteries, are just dirtier than internal

214
00:14:22,380 --> 00:14:24,940
combustion vehicles to produce.

215
00:14:24,940 --> 00:14:30,580
That being said, the vast majority of emissions from cars, including from EVs themselves,

216
00:14:30,580 --> 00:14:34,160
come not from the production of vehicles, but from driving them.

217
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:36,920
The science on the issue is sound.

218
00:14:36,920 --> 00:14:42,440
Electric vehicles, from production to use to scrapping, are responsible for about 75%

219
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:47,000
less emissions than their internal combustion counterparts, even on current fossil-fuel

220
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,920
based electric grids.

221
00:14:48,920 --> 00:14:53,840
Anyone who argues the opposite is either misinformed or attempting to disinform, and that gap will

222
00:14:53,840 --> 00:14:56,920
only widen as grids continue to decarbonize.

223
00:14:56,920 --> 00:15:01,560
However, there can be better alternatives to better alternatives.

224
00:15:01,560 --> 00:15:06,660
In the coming lithium gold rush, corners can, and likely will, be cut.

225
00:15:06,660 --> 00:15:10,380
The question the world will have to grapple with is whether it's worth destroying pristine

226
00:15:10,380 --> 00:15:14,960
environments like Thacker Pass in the name of environmentalism—whether slowing the

227
00:15:14,960 --> 00:15:19,420
issue on a global level is worth accelerating it on a local level.

228
00:15:19,420 --> 00:15:23,780
Then, when the answer inevitably gravitates towards yes, the world will have to grapple

229
00:15:23,780 --> 00:15:26,860
with who must confront that local devastation.

230
00:15:26,860 --> 00:15:30,740
If the answer continues to be to place the burden on the world's most vulnerable, then

231
00:15:30,740 --> 00:15:35,340
even if the steady march of climate change is curbed, will the world have truly succeeded

232
00:15:35,340 --> 00:15:37,080
in stopping its effects?

233
00:15:37,080 --> 00:15:41,020
Is it worth sending teenagers to die in a war to prevent the propagation of terrorist

234
00:15:41,020 --> 00:15:42,260
organizations?

235
00:15:42,260 --> 00:15:45,900
Is it worth depressing an economy to slow the spread of a pandemic?

236
00:15:45,900 --> 00:15:49,860
Is it worth allowing individuals to own guns for self-protection, even if it allows easier

237
00:15:49,860 --> 00:15:51,900
access for bad actors?

238
00:15:51,900 --> 00:15:57,060
Determining what is an acceptable sacrifice has historically led to some of the most contentious,

239
00:15:57,060 --> 00:15:59,540
perennial political issues in history.

240
00:15:59,540 --> 00:16:02,200
Here, it's happening again.

241
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:07,700
The public needs to decide, with the fate of the world on top of them, how much bad

242
00:16:07,700 --> 00:16:11,040
should be allowed for the greater good.

243
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:16,240
If you want to reduce your impact on the environment, one great place to start is with HelloFresh.

244
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:20,160
HelloFresh is a meal kit service that ships all the ingredients you need for their recipes

245
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:22,420
in exactly the quantities you need.

246
00:16:22,420 --> 00:16:26,640
The packaging is made out of 100% recycled content, and a University of Michigan study

247
00:16:26,640 --> 00:16:31,660
found that HelloFresh cut down on food waste by 25% compared to grocery shopping.

248
00:16:31,660 --> 00:16:36,540
That makes your meals greener, but on top of that, HelloFresh makes cooking a lot more

249
00:16:36,540 --> 00:16:37,540
convenient.

250
00:16:37,540 --> 00:16:41,220
Thanks to those pre-portioned ingredients, your shopping time becomes none, and your

251
00:16:41,220 --> 00:16:45,900
prep time is reduced, so it means you can make fresh, home-cooked meals in less time.

252
00:16:45,900 --> 00:16:49,880
I love the concept so much that I used HelloFresh for almost a year before they came along and

253
00:16:49,880 --> 00:16:52,540
sponsored us, and still do to this day.

254
00:16:52,540 --> 00:16:56,500
For example, last week I had the parmesan chicken with garlic scallions couscous and

255
00:16:56,500 --> 00:17:00,940
lemony roasted carrots for dinner, which, as always, was delicious, and HelloFresh also

256
00:17:00,940 --> 00:17:04,580
makes things easier for you if you're counting calories since they just tell you the nutritional

257
00:17:04,580 --> 00:17:08,900
info for each of their meals—no more adding up all the ingredients or approximating.

258
00:17:08,900 --> 00:17:13,680
All together, I love HelloFresh since it reduces my dependence on unhealthy and expensive freezer

259
00:17:13,680 --> 00:17:17,980
and delivery food, and helps me free up time, so I'd encourage you to try them out.
