WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:01.940
This is lithium.

00:01.940 --> 00:04.720
Pretty soon, we're going to need a lot of it.

00:04.720 --> 00:08.800
Lithium is a useful metal—it spends its entire existence trying to get rid of its

00:08.800 --> 00:15.720
one outer electron but, crucially, this reaction can be both controlled and reversed.

00:15.720 --> 00:20.200
That means, properly configured, the metal can discharge energy when needed, take in

00:20.200 --> 00:23.520
more energy, and then discharge that energy.

00:23.520 --> 00:26.120
Essentially, it can act as a battery.

00:26.640 --> 00:30.960
It's only been a few decades since lithium-ion batteries reached commercial feasibility,

00:30.960 --> 00:34.820
but in that time, they have become the power source of choice for portable electronics

00:34.820 --> 00:38.080
thanks to their perfect blend of safety and lightness.

00:38.080 --> 00:43.400
However, the latest major tech boom, the latest infatuation of Silicon Valley and Wall Street

00:43.400 --> 00:50.040
alike, is centered around the largest consumer electronics product to date—electric vehicles.

00:50.040 --> 00:53.120
And pretty soon, we're going to need a lot of them.

00:53.120 --> 00:58.260
The UK, for example, has committed to banning internal combustion car sales by 2030.

00:58.260 --> 01:04.720
To replace its 31.5 million vehicles, about 236,000 metric tons of lithium carbonate are

01:04.720 --> 01:05.720
needed.

01:05.720 --> 01:10.720
To produce 236,000 metric tons of lithium carbonate, every lithium mine in the world

01:10.720 --> 01:15.180
would have to devote its output to this one use for nine months, and there are a whole

01:15.180 --> 01:19.720
lot more countries, a whole lot more lithium applications, and a whole lot more growth

01:19.720 --> 01:20.720
in the forecast.

01:21.120 --> 01:25.600
While the industry and its issues may be complex, the way in which battery-grade lithium is

01:25.600 --> 01:27.920
produced is not.

01:27.920 --> 01:32.880
Four countries dominate the industry—Argentina, Chile, Australia, and China combined account

01:32.880 --> 01:35.580
for 92% of the globe's production.

01:35.580 --> 01:39.360
The metal is extracted from the ground at massive sites like the Greenbushes Mine in

01:39.360 --> 01:43.400
Western Australia, which is the world's largest hard-rock lithium mine.

01:43.400 --> 01:47.080
The site was selected due to the abundance of spodumene in the area, which is a mineral

01:47.080 --> 01:50.040
that contains large concentrations of lithium.

01:50.040 --> 01:53.520
Once the raw material is extracted from the ground, it's transported two and a half

01:53.520 --> 01:58.040
hours north to the Quinana lithium plant near Perth—a facility a majority owned and operated

01:58.040 --> 02:02.640
by a Chinese company, Tianqi Lithium, which is responsible for almost half of the world's

02:02.640 --> 02:04.080
production of the metal.

02:04.080 --> 02:08.600
Once refined, lithium hydroxide and other compounds are sold to battery manufacturers,

02:08.600 --> 02:13.720
which in about three-quarters of the cases means one of three companies—LG Chem, CATL,

02:13.720 --> 02:15.080
or Panasonic.

02:15.080 --> 02:18.400
The problem, however, is the world's solution.

02:18.400 --> 02:23.480
In addition to the UK, Iceland, Belgium, the Netherlands, Germany, Denmark, Norway, Sweden,

02:23.480 --> 02:27.860
Israel, Singapore, and South Korea have each committed to banning the sale of internal

02:27.860 --> 02:31.220
combustion passenger vehicles within the next decade.

02:31.220 --> 02:35.960
Adding up their annual passenger vehicle sales numbers from 2019, that means the absolute

02:35.960 --> 02:41.680
base-case demand for EVs a decade from now will be $9.5 million per year.

02:41.680 --> 02:45.760
Just to reach that, EV production would have to quintuple, but even the most conservative

02:45.760 --> 02:52.000
forecasters don't dare tread anywhere close to a number as low as $9.5 million in 2032.

02:52.000 --> 02:55.740
The market is waking up to what this means for lithium demand.

02:55.740 --> 03:01.160
Across 2021, seaborne lithium prices rose from around $8,000 per metric ton to over

03:01.160 --> 03:07.960
$30,000—a 400% rise in a mere 12 months, and lithium is hardly the only crucial metal

03:07.960 --> 03:11.760
for lithium-ion battery production—it's just the one in the name.

03:11.760 --> 03:16.000
Cobalt and nickel are also critical to most commercially available versions of these batteries,

03:16.000 --> 03:19.280
and the situation is hardly different with them.

03:19.280 --> 03:24.720
Cobalt prices doubled across 2021, while nickel rose to its highest price in a decade.

03:24.720 --> 03:30.480
So, the world needs a lot more metals, but right now, it's hard to believe the world's

03:30.480 --> 03:31.980
going to get them.

03:31.980 --> 03:37.720
The biggest hurdle the industry faces is exemplified here—Thacker Pass, Nevada.

03:37.720 --> 03:42.320
Thacker Pass is located in one of the most sparsely populated areas of the country—it's

03:42.320 --> 03:47.080
a half-hour's drive to the nearest store, an hour to the nearest supermarket, and three

03:47.080 --> 03:48.920
to the nearest Starbucks.

03:48.920 --> 03:53.320
The few roads that exist in the area are lucky to see a few cars an hour, traveling to and

03:53.320 --> 03:57.880
from the various remote farms, ranches, and communities dotting northern Nevada.

03:57.880 --> 04:02.680
That could soon change, though—250 miles, or 400 kilometers to the south, is the Silver

04:02.680 --> 04:04.200
Peak Lithium Mine.

04:04.200 --> 04:08.400
This is the nation's only currently operating major lithium mine, despite the fact that

04:08.400 --> 04:13.480
the US is one of the largest EV markets and home to the world's largest EV manufacturer.

04:13.480 --> 04:19.080
China, also a major EV market home to major EV manufacturers, has made significant headway

04:19.080 --> 04:23.040
in building up its domestic lithium production capacity, and the country's companies also

04:23.040 --> 04:27.280
have significant presences at the world's other major lithium production sites.

04:27.280 --> 04:30.800
This has come to concern those in charge in the US.

04:30.880 --> 04:36.760
Therefore, sites are set on Thacker Pass, home to the US's largest lithium deposit.

04:36.760 --> 04:41.760
The site could single-handedly propel the US into the ranks of major lithium producers,

04:41.760 --> 04:45.780
but getting a mine up and running there has proved difficult.

04:45.780 --> 04:50.720
The way in which major lithium deposits are distributed across the world is rather cruel.

04:50.720 --> 04:55.480
Overwhelmingly, they're located in arid regions with little water availability, like

04:55.480 --> 04:56.680
Nevada.

04:56.680 --> 05:01.640
Thacker Pass receives less than 10 inches or 25 centimeters of rain a year.

05:01.640 --> 05:07.200
However, the extraction and processing of lithium requires enormous quantities of water.

05:07.200 --> 05:13.240
It's expected that operations at the proposed Thacker Pass lithium mine would require 3,224

05:13.240 --> 05:20.520
gallons or 12,204 liters of water per minute—roughly equivalent to the contents of a backyard above-ground

05:20.520 --> 05:21.520
pool.

05:21.520 --> 05:24.880
That water would be used to pump into the ground as part of the extraction process,

05:24.880 --> 05:29.280
during refinement, and to conduct necessary dust control at the site.

05:29.280 --> 05:33.200
To get this water, the mine would have to pump it out of the ground using wells, but

05:33.200 --> 05:38.560
every acre-foot of water in the area is strictly allocated, given the degree of scarcity.

05:38.560 --> 05:43.340
So, the mine has to buy up water rights from others in order to gain the legal right to

05:43.340 --> 05:44.440
use it.

05:44.440 --> 05:49.080
What that means, however, is that there's a direct trade-off between one use and another,

05:49.080 --> 05:54.160
and in this case, the other use is predominantly ranching and farming—two key tenants to

05:54.160 --> 05:55.160
the local economy.

05:55.160 --> 06:00.040
In addition, there's a chance the project could do far more to further the inaccessibility

06:00.040 --> 06:02.040
of water in northern Nevada.

06:02.040 --> 06:05.800
The US Bureau of Land Management's Environmental Impact Study for the project found that it

06:05.800 --> 06:10.740
presented the distinct possibility of leaking unacceptable levels of arsenic into the area's

06:10.740 --> 06:15.180
groundwater table, which could take the entire region's water supply offline for hundreds

06:15.180 --> 06:16.180
of years.

06:16.180 --> 06:20.980
In an area where the availability of water undergirds almost all economic activity, that

06:20.980 --> 06:23.840
has people seriously concerned.

06:23.840 --> 06:26.800
The issues only compound on top of that.

06:26.800 --> 06:31.600
As Thacker Pass is, of course, a mountain pass, it acts as a wildlife corridor between

06:31.600 --> 06:35.840
the Double H and Montana Mountains—two biodiversity hotspots.

06:35.840 --> 06:40.480
Therefore, the Environmental Impact Study found the project likely to destroy or deteriorate

06:40.480 --> 06:45.400
thousands of acres of habitat used by the pronghorn antelope, sage-grouse, golden eagle,

06:45.400 --> 06:47.120
and other unique species.

06:47.120 --> 06:51.960
For interrelated reasons, the project also has a number of local indigenous tribes concerned—the

06:51.960 --> 06:55.740
most vocal of which is the Fort McDermott Paiute and Shoshone Tribe.

06:55.740 --> 06:59.600
They say that during the era of American soldiers rounding up and shipping indigenous people

06:59.600 --> 07:03.800
off to reservations, two of the tribe's families hid out in the shelter Thacker Pass

07:03.800 --> 07:08.840
provided, so they directly attribute the continued existence of their tribe to the area.

07:08.840 --> 07:13.660
In addition, they consider the pass a sacred site, in part because of a historic massacre,

07:13.660 --> 07:15.060
they say, occurred there.

07:15.060 --> 07:19.480
This assertion, however, was directly challenged in a court case related to the mine project,

07:19.480 --> 07:22.760
and the judge rejected the claim, citing a lack of evidence.

07:22.760 --> 07:26.440
To add to their opposition, the tribe put forward evidence linking the development of

07:26.440 --> 07:31.020
similar resource extraction projects, which are predominantly staffed by men, to increases

07:31.020 --> 07:34.840
in the rape and murder of indigenous women in nearby areas.

07:34.840 --> 07:39.560
Even just looking at these few headline issues, it becomes clear that the Thacker Pass Lithium

07:39.560 --> 07:45.200
Mine Project is mired in a nearly insurmountable web of controversy and conflict, and it's

07:45.200 --> 07:47.400
hardly alone in that status.

07:47.400 --> 07:51.500
Much of the evidence opponents to the Thacker Pass mine have put forward is based on real-world

07:51.500 --> 07:56.360
experiences in the Lithium Triangle—the nexus between Chile, Argentina, and Bolivia

07:56.360 --> 07:59.920
that host some of the world's most productive lithium production facilities.

07:59.920 --> 08:04.500
An area in a similar situation—a remote, arid landscape punctuated by small communities

08:04.500 --> 08:08.480
home to a historically oppressed indigenous population—the Lithium Triangle has seen

08:08.480 --> 08:14.240
an economic boon, but it's come at the cost of environmental and cultural devastation.

08:14.240 --> 08:17.720
Just as the issues are not confined to one geography, they're not even confined to

08:17.720 --> 08:23.040
lithium alone—some 70% of the world's cobalt, a crucial component to current battery

08:23.040 --> 08:27.400
tech, comes from the Democratic Republic of the Congo—the eighth poorest country in

08:27.400 --> 08:29.680
the world, according to World Bank figures.

08:29.680 --> 08:34.140
While a majority of the cobalt mining is conducted by large mining companies with often shaky

08:34.140 --> 08:39.060
safety and human rights records, a concerningly large minority is accomplished through what's

08:39.060 --> 08:43.800
referred to as artisanal mining—a term defining the illegal, informal practice of

08:43.800 --> 08:48.020
individuals mining cobalt by themselves and selling it on to shady middlemen.

08:48.020 --> 08:52.700
The complete lack of safety standards or regulations in the sector means child labor and deadly

08:52.700 --> 08:55.100
mine collapses are rampant.

08:55.100 --> 08:59.380
For those that aren't directly injured or killed on the job, long-term exposure to cobalt

08:59.380 --> 09:03.560
mines has been linked to significant health effects later in life, and fatal birth defects

09:03.560 --> 09:05.260
for children in the region.

09:05.260 --> 09:08.860
Altogether, there's almost no such thing as ethical cobalt.

09:08.860 --> 09:12.140
There's also almost no such thing as green lithium.

09:12.140 --> 09:16.740
There's little appetite anywhere to increasing lithium mining in the places where it's

09:16.740 --> 09:21.300
accessible, and little progress has been made in the DRC in making cobalt mining less socially

09:21.300 --> 09:22.300
disastrous.

09:22.300 --> 09:28.500
As demand for EVs and their batteries increases, getting more cobalt and lithium will be incredibly

09:28.500 --> 09:29.500
difficult.

09:29.500 --> 09:34.560
However, on top of that, getting more cobalt and lithium that's more ethical and green,

09:34.560 --> 09:38.760
or even as ethical and green, will be next to impossible.

09:38.760 --> 09:43.660
But to decarbonize driving, solutions must be found.

09:43.660 --> 09:48.060
One option, rather than finding more raw materials, is to need less of them.

09:48.060 --> 09:52.220
Of course, the way to do that is by making batteries better.

09:52.220 --> 09:56.580
The most promising short-term innovation that could fulfill that mission is solid-state

09:56.580 --> 09:58.020
batteries.

09:58.020 --> 10:02.880
Whereas traditional EV batteries have a liquidy, viscous lithium-based electrolyte, solid-state

10:02.880 --> 10:08.560
batteries rather use a solid, metal composition as their ion transport mechanism.

10:08.560 --> 10:12.320
This switch has a number of benefits, including a higher safety profile that reduces the risk

10:12.320 --> 10:16.940
of fire, and therefore reduces the need for expensive safety features.

10:16.940 --> 10:20.920
Solid-state batteries can also be made without cobalt or nickel, which eliminates two problematic

10:20.920 --> 10:24.200
and costly necessities in current battery tech.

10:24.200 --> 10:29.100
Most significant, however, is solid-state batteries' higher energy density.

10:29.100 --> 10:33.920
Several lithium-ion compositions used in EV battery packs store about 114 watt-hours

10:33.920 --> 10:37.740
of energy per pound, or 250 per kilogram.

10:37.740 --> 10:42.780
That means one pound of battery could move a Tesla Model 3, for example, 0.4 miles or

10:42.780 --> 10:44.700
1 kilogram 1.3 kilometers.

10:44.700 --> 10:49.780
Meanwhile, it's expected that solid-state batteries will be able to store between 175

10:49.780 --> 10:55.740
and 225 watt-hours per pound, or 400 to 500 per kilogram—essentially doubling battery

10:55.740 --> 10:56.780
density.

10:56.780 --> 11:00.480
That means Tesla could halve the weight of their half-ton battery pack, and not only

11:00.480 --> 11:04.960
keep range the same, but increase it as the car would no longer need to carry the rest

11:04.960 --> 11:06.880
of the weight of the battery pack.

11:06.880 --> 11:11.940
On top of all those benefits, experts believe that, at scale, production costs of solid-state

11:11.940 --> 11:15.940
batteries could be even less than the current cheapest lithium-ion batteries.

11:15.940 --> 11:18.920
However, the issue is getting to that scale.

11:18.920 --> 11:24.100
Battery production needs to occur at absolutely massive quantities to reach cost competitiveness—an

11:24.100 --> 11:27.780
assertion backed up by the industry's current effective triopoly.

11:27.780 --> 11:31.980
The process of working down this cost curve is long as there are few applications where

11:31.980 --> 11:36.700
battery weight matters as much as with EVs, and EVs won't switch to solid-state batteries

11:36.700 --> 11:40.420
until their cost is competitive, but their cost will only become competitive when the

11:40.420 --> 11:44.340
industry reaches a production capacity that only EVs can provide.

11:44.340 --> 11:48.620
So, the industry has to wait for some level of scale to occur through niche solid-state

11:48.620 --> 11:53.460
battery applications in medical devices, race cars, and fighter jets, then wait for consumer

11:53.460 --> 11:57.100
electronics to realize the weight savings or battery life benefits the innovation could

11:57.100 --> 12:01.420
provide, then wait for the highest-end EVs to incorporate the technology in order to

12:01.420 --> 12:05.940
offer super-long ranges as a luxury, before solid-state batteries can finally reach a

12:05.940 --> 12:09.840
cost that would allow them to permeate into what will be by then the large segment of

12:09.840 --> 12:11.840
everyday EVs.

12:11.840 --> 12:16.380
Most estimates place that enticing end goal more than a decade away.

12:16.380 --> 12:20.640
Even if the solid-state battery transition reaches fruition earlier, the world will still

12:20.640 --> 12:24.400
need a whole lot more lithium.

12:24.400 --> 12:29.440
Far from the potential environmental disaster at Thacker Pass is an existing environmental

12:29.440 --> 12:32.080
disaster—the Salton Sea.

12:32.080 --> 12:37.320
A century ago, Colorado River floodwaters breached through an irrigation canal and accumulated,

12:37.320 --> 12:43.120
over years, in the Imperial Valley's geographic low point, 236 feet or 72 meters below sea

12:43.120 --> 12:44.120
level.

12:44.120 --> 12:48.560
That massive puddle still exists today, but some of the water has slowly evaporated through

12:48.560 --> 12:53.320
time, leaving an even saltier, dirtier accumulation of water.

12:53.320 --> 12:57.560
Thousands more feet below, however, are a number of underground volcanoes that superheat

12:57.560 --> 13:00.000
water to hundreds of degrees.

13:00.000 --> 13:04.120
If one brings that water to the surface, the pressure change leads to it transforming into

13:04.120 --> 13:09.520
steam, and steam, of course, is what most power plants use to drive turbines.

13:09.520 --> 13:13.960
Traditional power plants use coal or natural gas to heat water up into steam, but this

13:13.960 --> 13:17.040
steam is created by the earth—meaning it's carbon-free.

13:17.040 --> 13:21.480
That's why Berkshire Hathaway Energy has built ten geothermal energy plants in the

13:21.480 --> 13:27.160
area, but crucially, this superheated water is filled with something else—lithium.

13:27.160 --> 13:31.920
Therefore, these geothermal plants are planning on adding an extra step in their process to

13:31.920 --> 13:34.760
extract lithium from the briny steam they use.

13:34.760 --> 13:39.400
Now, there are certainly significant technological hurdles that stand between now and a future

13:39.400 --> 13:43.280
of commercially competitive lithium production at the Salton Sea, especially as the metal

13:43.280 --> 13:48.520
only represents a tiny portion of the slurry of materials found in the water, but the lithium

13:48.520 --> 13:50.200
is there.

13:50.200 --> 13:53.920
Berkshire Hathaway Energy, as the largest existing energy company working around the

13:53.920 --> 13:58.420
Salton Sea, is leading the charge thanks in part to a sizable federal grant, and expects

13:58.420 --> 14:02.440
to have its demonstration facility up and running later in 2022.

14:02.440 --> 14:05.880
A number of other competitors have already started developing their lithium extraction

14:05.880 --> 14:11.020
plays around the Salton Sea, meaning America's first lithium boomtown might already be a

14:11.020 --> 14:13.360
foregone conclusion.

14:13.360 --> 14:18.180
These are the kind of solutions needed as the world transitions to electric mobility.

14:18.180 --> 14:22.380
Electric vehicles, due to their reliance on batteries, are just dirtier than internal

14:22.380 --> 14:24.940
combustion vehicles to produce.

14:24.940 --> 14:30.580
That being said, the vast majority of emissions from cars, including from EVs themselves,

14:30.580 --> 14:34.160
come not from the production of vehicles, but from driving them.

14:34.160 --> 14:36.920
The science on the issue is sound.

14:36.920 --> 14:42.440
Electric vehicles, from production to use to scrapping, are responsible for about 75%

14:42.440 --> 14:47.000
less emissions than their internal combustion counterparts, even on current fossil-fuel

14:47.000 --> 14:48.920
based electric grids.

14:48.920 --> 14:53.840
Anyone who argues the opposite is either misinformed or attempting to disinform, and that gap will

14:53.840 --> 14:56.920
only widen as grids continue to decarbonize.

14:56.920 --> 15:01.560
However, there can be better alternatives to better alternatives.

15:01.560 --> 15:06.660
In the coming lithium gold rush, corners can, and likely will, be cut.

15:06.660 --> 15:10.380
The question the world will have to grapple with is whether it's worth destroying pristine

15:10.380 --> 15:14.960
environments like Thacker Pass in the name of environmentalism—whether slowing the

15:14.960 --> 15:19.420
issue on a global level is worth accelerating it on a local level.

15:19.420 --> 15:23.780
Then, when the answer inevitably gravitates towards yes, the world will have to grapple

15:23.780 --> 15:26.860
with who must confront that local devastation.

15:26.860 --> 15:30.740
If the answer continues to be to place the burden on the world's most vulnerable, then

15:30.740 --> 15:35.340
even if the steady march of climate change is curbed, will the world have truly succeeded

15:35.340 --> 15:37.080
in stopping its effects?

15:37.080 --> 15:41.020
Is it worth sending teenagers to die in a war to prevent the propagation of terrorist

15:41.020 --> 15:42.260
organizations?

15:42.260 --> 15:45.900
Is it worth depressing an economy to slow the spread of a pandemic?

15:45.900 --> 15:49.860
Is it worth allowing individuals to own guns for self-protection, even if it allows easier

15:49.860 --> 15:51.900
access for bad actors?

15:51.900 --> 15:57.060
Determining what is an acceptable sacrifice has historically led to some of the most contentious,

15:57.060 --> 15:59.540
perennial political issues in history.

15:59.540 --> 16:02.200
Here, it's happening again.

16:02.200 --> 16:07.700
The public needs to decide, with the fate of the world on top of them, how much bad

16:07.700 --> 16:11.040
should be allowed for the greater good.

16:11.040 --> 16:16.240
If you want to reduce your impact on the environment, one great place to start is with HelloFresh.

16:16.240 --> 16:20.160
HelloFresh is a meal kit service that ships all the ingredients you need for their recipes

16:20.160 --> 16:22.420
in exactly the quantities you need.

16:22.420 --> 16:26.640
The packaging is made out of 100% recycled content, and a University of Michigan study

16:26.640 --> 16:31.660
found that HelloFresh cut down on food waste by 25% compared to grocery shopping.

16:31.660 --> 16:36.540
That makes your meals greener, but on top of that, HelloFresh makes cooking a lot more

16:36.540 --> 16:37.540
convenient.

16:37.540 --> 16:41.220
Thanks to those pre-portioned ingredients, your shopping time becomes none, and your

16:41.220 --> 16:45.900
prep time is reduced, so it means you can make fresh, home-cooked meals in less time.

16:45.900 --> 16:49.880
I love the concept so much that I used HelloFresh for almost a year before they came along and

16:49.880 --> 16:52.540
sponsored us, and still do to this day.

16:52.540 --> 16:56.500
For example, last week I had the parmesan chicken with garlic scallions couscous and

16:56.500 --> 17:00.940
lemony roasted carrots for dinner, which, as always, was delicious, and HelloFresh also

17:00.940 --> 17:04.580
makes things easier for you if you're counting calories since they just tell you the nutritional

17:04.580 --> 17:08.900
info for each of their meals—no more adding up all the ingredients or approximating.

17:08.900 --> 17:13.680
All together, I love HelloFresh since it reduces my dependence on unhealthy and expensive freezer

17:13.680 --> 17:17.980
and delivery food, and helps me free up time, so I'd encourage you to try them out.

17:17.980 --> 17:23.020
