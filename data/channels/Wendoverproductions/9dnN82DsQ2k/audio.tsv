0	1940	This is lithium.
1940	4720	Pretty soon, we're going to need a lot of it.
4720	8800	Lithium is a useful metal—it spends its entire existence trying to get rid of its
8800	15720	one outer electron but, crucially, this reaction can be both controlled and reversed.
15720	20200	That means, properly configured, the metal can discharge energy when needed, take in
20200	23520	more energy, and then discharge that energy.
23520	26120	Essentially, it can act as a battery.
26640	30960	It's only been a few decades since lithium-ion batteries reached commercial feasibility,
30960	34820	but in that time, they have become the power source of choice for portable electronics
34820	38080	thanks to their perfect blend of safety and lightness.
38080	43400	However, the latest major tech boom, the latest infatuation of Silicon Valley and Wall Street
43400	50040	alike, is centered around the largest consumer electronics product to date—electric vehicles.
50040	53120	And pretty soon, we're going to need a lot of them.
53120	58260	The UK, for example, has committed to banning internal combustion car sales by 2030.
58260	64720	To replace its 31.5 million vehicles, about 236,000 metric tons of lithium carbonate are
64720	65720	needed.
65720	70720	To produce 236,000 metric tons of lithium carbonate, every lithium mine in the world
70720	75180	would have to devote its output to this one use for nine months, and there are a whole
75180	79720	lot more countries, a whole lot more lithium applications, and a whole lot more growth
79720	80720	in the forecast.
81120	85600	While the industry and its issues may be complex, the way in which battery-grade lithium is
85600	87920	produced is not.
87920	92880	Four countries dominate the industry—Argentina, Chile, Australia, and China combined account
92880	95580	for 92% of the globe's production.
95580	99360	The metal is extracted from the ground at massive sites like the Greenbushes Mine in
99360	103400	Western Australia, which is the world's largest hard-rock lithium mine.
103400	107080	The site was selected due to the abundance of spodumene in the area, which is a mineral
107080	110040	that contains large concentrations of lithium.
110040	113520	Once the raw material is extracted from the ground, it's transported two and a half
113520	118040	hours north to the Quinana lithium plant near Perth—a facility a majority owned and operated
118040	122640	by a Chinese company, Tianqi Lithium, which is responsible for almost half of the world's
122640	124080	production of the metal.
124080	128600	Once refined, lithium hydroxide and other compounds are sold to battery manufacturers,
128600	133720	which in about three-quarters of the cases means one of three companies—LG Chem, CATL,
133720	135080	or Panasonic.
135080	138400	The problem, however, is the world's solution.
138400	143480	In addition to the UK, Iceland, Belgium, the Netherlands, Germany, Denmark, Norway, Sweden,
143480	147860	Israel, Singapore, and South Korea have each committed to banning the sale of internal
147860	151220	combustion passenger vehicles within the next decade.
151220	155960	Adding up their annual passenger vehicle sales numbers from 2019, that means the absolute
155960	161680	base-case demand for EVs a decade from now will be $9.5 million per year.
161680	165760	Just to reach that, EV production would have to quintuple, but even the most conservative
165760	172000	forecasters don't dare tread anywhere close to a number as low as $9.5 million in 2032.
172000	175740	The market is waking up to what this means for lithium demand.
175740	181160	Across 2021, seaborne lithium prices rose from around $8,000 per metric ton to over
181160	187960	$30,000—a 400% rise in a mere 12 months, and lithium is hardly the only crucial metal
187960	191760	for lithium-ion battery production—it's just the one in the name.
191760	196000	Cobalt and nickel are also critical to most commercially available versions of these batteries,
196000	199280	and the situation is hardly different with them.
199280	204720	Cobalt prices doubled across 2021, while nickel rose to its highest price in a decade.
204720	210480	So, the world needs a lot more metals, but right now, it's hard to believe the world's
210480	211980	going to get them.
211980	217720	The biggest hurdle the industry faces is exemplified here—Thacker Pass, Nevada.
217720	222320	Thacker Pass is located in one of the most sparsely populated areas of the country—it's
222320	227080	a half-hour's drive to the nearest store, an hour to the nearest supermarket, and three
227080	228920	to the nearest Starbucks.
228920	233320	The few roads that exist in the area are lucky to see a few cars an hour, traveling to and
233320	237880	from the various remote farms, ranches, and communities dotting northern Nevada.
237880	242680	That could soon change, though—250 miles, or 400 kilometers to the south, is the Silver
242680	244200	Peak Lithium Mine.
244200	248400	This is the nation's only currently operating major lithium mine, despite the fact that
248400	253480	the US is one of the largest EV markets and home to the world's largest EV manufacturer.
253480	259080	China, also a major EV market home to major EV manufacturers, has made significant headway
259080	263040	in building up its domestic lithium production capacity, and the country's companies also
263040	267280	have significant presences at the world's other major lithium production sites.
267280	270800	This has come to concern those in charge in the US.
270880	276760	Therefore, sites are set on Thacker Pass, home to the US's largest lithium deposit.
276760	281760	The site could single-handedly propel the US into the ranks of major lithium producers,
281760	285780	but getting a mine up and running there has proved difficult.
285780	290720	The way in which major lithium deposits are distributed across the world is rather cruel.
290720	295480	Overwhelmingly, they're located in arid regions with little water availability, like
295480	296680	Nevada.
296680	301640	Thacker Pass receives less than 10 inches or 25 centimeters of rain a year.
301640	307200	However, the extraction and processing of lithium requires enormous quantities of water.
307200	313240	It's expected that operations at the proposed Thacker Pass lithium mine would require 3,224
313240	320520	gallons or 12,204 liters of water per minute—roughly equivalent to the contents of a backyard above-ground
320520	321520	pool.
321520	324880	That water would be used to pump into the ground as part of the extraction process,
324880	329280	during refinement, and to conduct necessary dust control at the site.
329280	333200	To get this water, the mine would have to pump it out of the ground using wells, but
333200	338560	every acre-foot of water in the area is strictly allocated, given the degree of scarcity.
338560	343340	So, the mine has to buy up water rights from others in order to gain the legal right to
343340	344440	use it.
344440	349080	What that means, however, is that there's a direct trade-off between one use and another,
349080	354160	and in this case, the other use is predominantly ranching and farming—two key tenants to
354160	355160	the local economy.
355160	360040	In addition, there's a chance the project could do far more to further the inaccessibility
360040	362040	of water in northern Nevada.
362040	365800	The US Bureau of Land Management's Environmental Impact Study for the project found that it
365800	370740	presented the distinct possibility of leaking unacceptable levels of arsenic into the area's
370740	375180	groundwater table, which could take the entire region's water supply offline for hundreds
375180	376180	of years.
376180	380980	In an area where the availability of water undergirds almost all economic activity, that
380980	383840	has people seriously concerned.
383840	386800	The issues only compound on top of that.
386800	391600	As Thacker Pass is, of course, a mountain pass, it acts as a wildlife corridor between
391600	395840	the Double H and Montana Mountains—two biodiversity hotspots.
395840	400480	Therefore, the Environmental Impact Study found the project likely to destroy or deteriorate
400480	405400	thousands of acres of habitat used by the pronghorn antelope, sage-grouse, golden eagle,
405400	407120	and other unique species.
407120	411960	For interrelated reasons, the project also has a number of local indigenous tribes concerned—the
411960	415740	most vocal of which is the Fort McDermott Paiute and Shoshone Tribe.
415740	419600	They say that during the era of American soldiers rounding up and shipping indigenous people
419600	423800	off to reservations, two of the tribe's families hid out in the shelter Thacker Pass
423800	428840	provided, so they directly attribute the continued existence of their tribe to the area.
428840	433660	In addition, they consider the pass a sacred site, in part because of a historic massacre,
433660	435060	they say, occurred there.
435060	439480	This assertion, however, was directly challenged in a court case related to the mine project,
439480	442760	and the judge rejected the claim, citing a lack of evidence.
442760	446440	To add to their opposition, the tribe put forward evidence linking the development of
446440	451020	similar resource extraction projects, which are predominantly staffed by men, to increases
451020	454840	in the rape and murder of indigenous women in nearby areas.
454840	459560	Even just looking at these few headline issues, it becomes clear that the Thacker Pass Lithium
459560	465200	Mine Project is mired in a nearly insurmountable web of controversy and conflict, and it's
465200	467400	hardly alone in that status.
467400	471500	Much of the evidence opponents to the Thacker Pass mine have put forward is based on real-world
471500	476360	experiences in the Lithium Triangle—the nexus between Chile, Argentina, and Bolivia
476360	479920	that host some of the world's most productive lithium production facilities.
479920	484500	An area in a similar situation—a remote, arid landscape punctuated by small communities
484500	488480	home to a historically oppressed indigenous population—the Lithium Triangle has seen
488480	494240	an economic boon, but it's come at the cost of environmental and cultural devastation.
494240	497720	Just as the issues are not confined to one geography, they're not even confined to
497720	503040	lithium alone—some 70% of the world's cobalt, a crucial component to current battery
503040	507400	tech, comes from the Democratic Republic of the Congo—the eighth poorest country in
507400	509680	the world, according to World Bank figures.
509680	514140	While a majority of the cobalt mining is conducted by large mining companies with often shaky
514140	519060	safety and human rights records, a concerningly large minority is accomplished through what's
519060	523800	referred to as artisanal mining—a term defining the illegal, informal practice of
523800	528020	individuals mining cobalt by themselves and selling it on to shady middlemen.
528020	532700	The complete lack of safety standards or regulations in the sector means child labor and deadly
532700	535100	mine collapses are rampant.
535100	539380	For those that aren't directly injured or killed on the job, long-term exposure to cobalt
539380	543560	mines has been linked to significant health effects later in life, and fatal birth defects
543560	545260	for children in the region.
545260	548860	Altogether, there's almost no such thing as ethical cobalt.
548860	552140	There's also almost no such thing as green lithium.
552140	556740	There's little appetite anywhere to increasing lithium mining in the places where it's
556740	561300	accessible, and little progress has been made in the DRC in making cobalt mining less socially
561300	562300	disastrous.
562300	568500	As demand for EVs and their batteries increases, getting more cobalt and lithium will be incredibly
568500	569500	difficult.
569500	574560	However, on top of that, getting more cobalt and lithium that's more ethical and green,
574560	578760	or even as ethical and green, will be next to impossible.
578760	583660	But to decarbonize driving, solutions must be found.
583660	588060	One option, rather than finding more raw materials, is to need less of them.
588060	592220	Of course, the way to do that is by making batteries better.
592220	596580	The most promising short-term innovation that could fulfill that mission is solid-state
596580	598020	batteries.
598020	602880	Whereas traditional EV batteries have a liquidy, viscous lithium-based electrolyte, solid-state
602880	608560	batteries rather use a solid, metal composition as their ion transport mechanism.
608560	612320	This switch has a number of benefits, including a higher safety profile that reduces the risk
612320	616940	of fire, and therefore reduces the need for expensive safety features.
616940	620920	Solid-state batteries can also be made without cobalt or nickel, which eliminates two problematic
620920	624200	and costly necessities in current battery tech.
624200	629100	Most significant, however, is solid-state batteries' higher energy density.
629100	633920	Several lithium-ion compositions used in EV battery packs store about 114 watt-hours
633920	637740	of energy per pound, or 250 per kilogram.
637740	642780	That means one pound of battery could move a Tesla Model 3, for example, 0.4 miles or
642780	644700	1 kilogram 1.3 kilometers.
644700	649780	Meanwhile, it's expected that solid-state batteries will be able to store between 175
649780	655740	and 225 watt-hours per pound, or 400 to 500 per kilogram—essentially doubling battery
655740	656780	density.
656780	660480	That means Tesla could halve the weight of their half-ton battery pack, and not only
660480	664960	keep range the same, but increase it as the car would no longer need to carry the rest
664960	666880	of the weight of the battery pack.
666880	671940	On top of all those benefits, experts believe that, at scale, production costs of solid-state
671940	675940	batteries could be even less than the current cheapest lithium-ion batteries.
675940	678920	However, the issue is getting to that scale.
678920	684100	Battery production needs to occur at absolutely massive quantities to reach cost competitiveness—an
684100	687780	assertion backed up by the industry's current effective triopoly.
687780	691980	The process of working down this cost curve is long as there are few applications where
691980	696700	battery weight matters as much as with EVs, and EVs won't switch to solid-state batteries
696700	700420	until their cost is competitive, but their cost will only become competitive when the
700420	704340	industry reaches a production capacity that only EVs can provide.
704340	708620	So, the industry has to wait for some level of scale to occur through niche solid-state
708620	713460	battery applications in medical devices, race cars, and fighter jets, then wait for consumer
713460	717100	electronics to realize the weight savings or battery life benefits the innovation could
717100	721420	provide, then wait for the highest-end EVs to incorporate the technology in order to
721420	725940	offer super-long ranges as a luxury, before solid-state batteries can finally reach a
725940	729840	cost that would allow them to permeate into what will be by then the large segment of
729840	731840	everyday EVs.
731840	736380	Most estimates place that enticing end goal more than a decade away.
736380	740640	Even if the solid-state battery transition reaches fruition earlier, the world will still
740640	744400	need a whole lot more lithium.
744400	749440	Far from the potential environmental disaster at Thacker Pass is an existing environmental
749440	752080	disaster—the Salton Sea.
752080	757320	A century ago, Colorado River floodwaters breached through an irrigation canal and accumulated,
757320	763120	over years, in the Imperial Valley's geographic low point, 236 feet or 72 meters below sea
763120	764120	level.
764120	768560	That massive puddle still exists today, but some of the water has slowly evaporated through
768560	773320	time, leaving an even saltier, dirtier accumulation of water.
773320	777560	Thousands more feet below, however, are a number of underground volcanoes that superheat
777560	780000	water to hundreds of degrees.
780000	784120	If one brings that water to the surface, the pressure change leads to it transforming into
784120	789520	steam, and steam, of course, is what most power plants use to drive turbines.
789520	793960	Traditional power plants use coal or natural gas to heat water up into steam, but this
793960	797040	steam is created by the earth—meaning it's carbon-free.
797040	801480	That's why Berkshire Hathaway Energy has built ten geothermal energy plants in the
801480	807160	area, but crucially, this superheated water is filled with something else—lithium.
807160	811920	Therefore, these geothermal plants are planning on adding an extra step in their process to
811920	814760	extract lithium from the briny steam they use.
814760	819400	Now, there are certainly significant technological hurdles that stand between now and a future
819400	823280	of commercially competitive lithium production at the Salton Sea, especially as the metal
823280	828520	only represents a tiny portion of the slurry of materials found in the water, but the lithium
828520	830200	is there.
830200	833920	Berkshire Hathaway Energy, as the largest existing energy company working around the
833920	838420	Salton Sea, is leading the charge thanks in part to a sizable federal grant, and expects
838420	842440	to have its demonstration facility up and running later in 2022.
842440	845880	A number of other competitors have already started developing their lithium extraction
845880	851020	plays around the Salton Sea, meaning America's first lithium boomtown might already be a
851020	853360	foregone conclusion.
853360	858180	These are the kind of solutions needed as the world transitions to electric mobility.
858180	862380	Electric vehicles, due to their reliance on batteries, are just dirtier than internal
862380	864940	combustion vehicles to produce.
864940	870580	That being said, the vast majority of emissions from cars, including from EVs themselves,
870580	874160	come not from the production of vehicles, but from driving them.
874160	876920	The science on the issue is sound.
876920	882440	Electric vehicles, from production to use to scrapping, are responsible for about 75%
882440	887000	less emissions than their internal combustion counterparts, even on current fossil-fuel
887000	888920	based electric grids.
888920	893840	Anyone who argues the opposite is either misinformed or attempting to disinform, and that gap will
893840	896920	only widen as grids continue to decarbonize.
896920	901560	However, there can be better alternatives to better alternatives.
901560	906660	In the coming lithium gold rush, corners can, and likely will, be cut.
906660	910380	The question the world will have to grapple with is whether it's worth destroying pristine
910380	914960	environments like Thacker Pass in the name of environmentalism—whether slowing the
914960	919420	issue on a global level is worth accelerating it on a local level.
919420	923780	Then, when the answer inevitably gravitates towards yes, the world will have to grapple
923780	926860	with who must confront that local devastation.
926860	930740	If the answer continues to be to place the burden on the world's most vulnerable, then
930740	935340	even if the steady march of climate change is curbed, will the world have truly succeeded
935340	937080	in stopping its effects?
937080	941020	Is it worth sending teenagers to die in a war to prevent the propagation of terrorist
941020	942260	organizations?
942260	945900	Is it worth depressing an economy to slow the spread of a pandemic?
945900	949860	Is it worth allowing individuals to own guns for self-protection, even if it allows easier
949860	951900	access for bad actors?
951900	957060	Determining what is an acceptable sacrifice has historically led to some of the most contentious,
957060	959540	perennial political issues in history.
959540	962200	Here, it's happening again.
962200	967700	The public needs to decide, with the fate of the world on top of them, how much bad
967700	971040	should be allowed for the greater good.
971040	976240	If you want to reduce your impact on the environment, one great place to start is with HelloFresh.
976240	980160	HelloFresh is a meal kit service that ships all the ingredients you need for their recipes
980160	982420	in exactly the quantities you need.
982420	986640	The packaging is made out of 100% recycled content, and a University of Michigan study
986640	991660	found that HelloFresh cut down on food waste by 25% compared to grocery shopping.
991660	996540	That makes your meals greener, but on top of that, HelloFresh makes cooking a lot more
996540	997540	convenient.
997540	1001220	Thanks to those pre-portioned ingredients, your shopping time becomes none, and your
1001220	1005900	prep time is reduced, so it means you can make fresh, home-cooked meals in less time.
1005900	1009880	I love the concept so much that I used HelloFresh for almost a year before they came along and
1009880	1012540	sponsored us, and still do to this day.
1012540	1016500	For example, last week I had the parmesan chicken with garlic scallions couscous and
1016500	1020940	lemony roasted carrots for dinner, which, as always, was delicious, and HelloFresh also
1020940	1024580	makes things easier for you if you're counting calories since they just tell you the nutritional
1024580	1028900	info for each of their meals—no more adding up all the ingredients or approximating.
