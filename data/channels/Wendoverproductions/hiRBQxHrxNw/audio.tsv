10860	14940	And quickly, once you've finished this video there are two others to watch—a behind-the-scenes
14940	19340	video on my brand new personal channel and my appearance on StarTalk where I appear on
19340	21140	camera for the first time.
21140	22620	Both are linked in the description.
22620	28580	Suppose we're in a cave right now, this is a cave, and there's maybe ten of us.
28580	31300	We have a mini family tribe.
31300	35120	And I say, you know, I want to go out and see what's on the other side of that mountain.
35120	36840	We can see it from here.
36840	41060	And then you say, no, no, we have cave problems you have to fix first.
41060	45220	Fix all the cave problems first, then you can go out on the mountain.
45220	50180	And that's what it sounds like to me when I hear people say, we have problems on Earth,
50460	52860	let's fix those before we go into space.
52860	59700	And here's Earth, this speck of dirt orbiting an ordinary star and there's this vastness
59700	64700	of the universe that is waiting for us.
64700	66700	It beckons.
71740	74180	The commercial space industry is heating up.
74180	78460	Fifty years ago, outer space was reserved for the most powerful of nations—the most
78460	79460	dominant governments.
79740	83180	But today, there's a democratization of space.
83180	87060	Commercial industry is inching us closer to the cosmos, and in the process, there's
87060	91420	a growing interdependence between what's happening hundreds of miles up in space and
91420	93080	down below on Earth.
93080	97900	The commercial space industry—using multi-million dollar satellites and rockets—is increasingly
97900	100260	playing a part in our everyday lives.
100260	102980	You may think of this industry as a new phenomenon.
102980	107900	You may have only started hearing about profit-seeking space enterprise in the past few years, but
108340	111340	in reality, this has been going on for decades.
116340	121460	Our founder, Walter Scott, founded the company in his garage in Palo Alto twenty-five years
121460	122460	ago.
122460	123460	This is Dan Jablonski.
123460	127460	He's president of one of the commercial space companies that you might not have heard
127460	129140	of—Digital Globe.
129140	133380	They might not be as flashy as SpaceX or as exciting as Virgin Galactic, but they've
133380	137840	been flying satellites since before Elon Musk even graduated college.
138780	142620	In fact, they were the very first American company to be granted a license to take high
142620	148380	resolution pictures from space and that is essentially what they do—they take pictures
148380	152040	from space, but it's a lot more complicated than it sounds.
152040	156880	To take those images from space, you need satellites and Digital Globe has five of them.
156880	162000	So the five satellites we have on orbit are GOI-1, Worldview-1, Worldview-2, Worldview-3,
162000	164520	and you're noticing a trend here, Worldview-4.
164520	167480	The first of those was launched in 2007.
167480	172760	The most recent was launched in 2016 and they have an expected life of over ten years
172760	173760	each.
173760	176160	And these are really good satellites.
176160	181980	Worldview-4, for example, Digital Globe's newest satellite, has a pixel size of 12 inches.
181980	188300	That means that this satellite, orbiting 383 miles above earth, can clearly see a single
188300	190720	sheet of paper placed in a parking lot.
190720	195040	Horizontally, that's like if a camera in Toronto took a picture that could clearly
195040	199440	identify the individual eyes of the Statue of Liberty in New York.
199440	202600	It is insanely high resolution.
202600	206200	With a 30 centimeter pixel you can actually pick up road markings.
206200	209160	You can see the lines on the road whether they're straight or dashed lines.
209160	213520	You can see whether there are turn arrows there, whether there's a stop word on the
213520	214520	road markings.
214520	218060	You can even pick up some of the traffic signs and traffic light sizes.
218060	223600	The potential uses of such high quality imagery are endless, but how do the satellites even
223600	224600	work?
225040	228280	It's good to know that our satellites are in a low earth orbit which means that they
228280	232080	actually don't—they're not like a geo-satellite that sits up in a fixed orbit and stays over
232080	233200	one place on the planet.
233200	237360	Some satellites are specifically designed to stay directly over one position for their
237360	239100	whole service lives.
239100	243640	Their orbits are significantly higher above earth so the time it takes for them to complete
243640	249360	an orbit is exactly the same as the time it takes the earth to make a full rotation so,
249360	252960	relative to earth, the satellite doesn't move at all.
252960	256680	This is incredibly useful for certain uses like communications.
256680	262500	When a communications company launches a satellite to broadcast TV or radio or internet, they
262500	266360	want that satellite to stay over their particular service area.
266360	271040	DirecTV, for example, the American satellite TV company, want their satellites to stay
271040	274480	over the US because that's their service area.
274480	278260	If they weren't able to put their satellites into geo-synchronous orbit, they would have
278260	283340	to launch enough satellites to cover the entire world even if they were only broadcasting
283340	284340	to the US.
284340	289700	So, DirecTV want their satellites to stay over one area because they're broadcasting
289700	295100	to one area, but Digital Globe, on the other hand, want their satellites to move because
295100	298100	they're imaging the entire world.
298100	301660	Each of our satellites right now are in sun synchronous orbits.
301660	305600	So what that means is that the orbital plane that the satellite is flying around in stays
305600	309600	in the same orientation relative to the sun all the time.
309600	314280	Simplified, that means that any given satellite passes over any given location on earth at
314280	316800	the exact same time every day.
316800	322160	Worldview 3, for example, always orbits above the points on earth where it's 1030 AM.
322160	326760	When it passes over Denver it's 1030 in Denver, when it passes over Paris it's 1030
326760	331000	in Paris, and when it passes over Tokyo it's 1030 in Tokyo.
331000	335520	How this works is that essentially, with each pass over the light side of earth, the orbit
335520	340460	advances relative to the earth at the same rate as the sunlight advances.
340460	345840	This orbit type is crucial because a lot of what satellite imaging is about is detecting
345840	351920	change from day to day, month to month, or year to year, and an image taken at 1030 AM
351920	355760	is going to look very different than one taken at 6 PM.
355760	361000	This orbit type allows the satellite to pass over the entirety of earth once per day at
361000	364640	the same time so the light conditions look the same.
364640	369320	The satellites do, of course, need to be told what to do and that all comes down to four
369320	371420	people in one room.
371420	375080	So this is our mission operations control center.
375080	379720	This is where we fly the five satellites on orbit and really inside this room is what
379720	385620	we consider our time-dominant, real-time activities from choosing, making the final choices of
385620	391000	what images we're going to collect in the next several minutes to the next several hours.
391000	395540	These four individuals are controlling billions of dollars worth of satellites.
395540	401000	This whole company—the thousands of employees and hundreds of millions of dollars in revenue—all
401000	406620	exist to organize and fund what these four individuals are doing—sitting and piloting
406620	408840	the satellites above in space.
408840	413960	The mission operations center is, of course, staffed 24-7 since, while it's nighttime
413960	417360	in the US, it's daytime in Asia and Australia.
417360	421720	The satellite vehicle operator's main task is to load plans onto the satellites of which
421720	426320	images to take when, to monitor that the satellites are operating correctly, and to assure that
426320	429820	the satellites won't collide with other satellites or space junk.
429820	434000	The central screens at the front show the current locations of each of the five satellites
434000	438780	while the one to the left displays other information such as the total number of times each satellite
438780	443580	has orbited around the earth and how much time they have until the satellite loses signal.
443580	447900	You see, in order for satellites to function, they need to be able to communicate with the
447900	451420	ground and that's done with ground stations.
451420	456220	These antennas communicate to satellites using what are essentially super high-powered wifi
456220	457220	signals.
457220	461740	The ground station's digital globe users are able to receive about a gigabyte of information
461740	464220	every second from the satellites.
464220	467940	Each of those antennas around the world see each satellite several times a day and so
467940	473660	is that, as we go through the day, we accumulate about 7 terabytes of raw imagery off the satellites
473660	476060	through that gigabit connection.
476060	479780	Satellites can only communicate with the ground stations while they have a line of sight with
479780	485220	the antenna so, due to the curvature of the earth, in the view of any given ground station,
485220	487980	the satellite will eventually dip below the horizon.
487980	492600	Therefore, each ground station only has a limited operating range.
492600	496620	The exact locations of ground stations are, understandably, kept secret, but if there
496620	500600	was one in Germany, for example, it would communicate with the digital globe satellites
500600	503540	exclusively while they passed over Europe.
503540	508300	The fact that these satellites have to, by nature, pass over the entire world is actually,
508300	510140	however, quite useful.
510140	514820	Not only does this let digital globe map the entire world, but they also use the extra
514820	517340	capacity for humanitarian efforts.
517340	522420	It's actually easier for us on the humanitarian global development side because we have much
522420	525300	more capacity over a lot of these areas.
525300	530740	There's a lot more demand for our satellites over developed countries, for instance, right?
530740	536060	So people are typically, for commercial applications, much more interested in the U.S. or Europe
536060	541500	or some of these more developed areas versus sub-Saharan Africa where we, just generally
541500	546460	speaking, have much more ability to task the constellation and to collect those imagery.
546460	551980	So it's actually an opportunity for us to support those use cases much more than others.
551980	556080	For instance, Digital Globe partners with the Gates Foundation to map every single building
556080	561220	structure in rural Zambia so aid workers now know things like how many bed nets, vaccines,
561220	564860	or food to bring to communities that were previously unmapped.
564860	570780	There are few companies the size of commercial space companies that rely on so few assets.
570780	575980	What makes Digital Globe, for example, run are those five satellites and to get those
575980	580640	to space, to the place where they make money, they had to put them on rockets which tend
580640	583120	to, from time to time, blow up.
583120	586640	It's always a little bit of a nail biter as you come up to a launch.
586640	591880	We put an enormous capital investment into the satellites and the launch vehicle and
591880	596320	it all comes down to a one hour event—lifting off from the ground and going into orbit and
596320	600040	that's a, that can be a little bit of a nerve-wracking period but certainly very exciting
600040	601600	at the same time.
601600	607240	An average of one in twenty rocket launches fail and then, on top of that, some satellites
607240	611360	fail once they reach orbit which makes the space business risky.
611360	615680	Companies like Digital Globe will therefore purchase enormously expensive insurance policies
615680	619960	on their satellites in case the launch or the satellite itself fails.
619960	624280	If they didn't, one bad launch could spell the end for the company.
624280	628280	Of course, some launch providers are much more reliable than others.
628280	631840	United Launch Alliance, the launch provider that Digital Globe used for their current
631840	636560	five satellites, has not had a launch failure in its eleven year history.
636560	640880	Insurance rates for ULA would be relatively low while insurance rates for a newer launch
640880	645160	provider, such as Orbital ATK or Blue Origin, would be comparatively high.
645160	650160	Nonetheless, the cost of newer launch providers with insurance included is now often less
650160	652800	than the older, more reliable launch companies.
652800	655500	But how does Digital Globe fund their exploits?
655500	657580	What keeps those satellites flying?
657580	659560	How do they make their money?
659560	662800	Our largest customer is the US government and we've been very proud to be their mission
662800	666760	partner for over a decade and a half coming up on two decades now.
666760	672360	It used to be that the commercial satellite industry was essentially focused on one major
672360	674180	customer—governments.
674180	679060	In the past, the US government has been the single largest customer of the few commercial
679060	683440	space companies that there were thanks to its enormous defense spending, but today as
683440	689060	commercial customers contract commercial space companies, the business is spreading globally.
689060	694820	Over the past decade, the customer base has become more international and more diversified.
694820	701240	Our other customers are international customers who may be US allies or maybe technology companies
701240	702700	across the world.
702700	708220	We go deep in the telecommunications infrastructure, online mapping, energy industries, mining
708220	710380	industries, forestry applications.
710380	715500	There's really a huge variety of customers, but the most obvious ones are those mapping
715500	716500	companies.
716500	719400	If you've ever used Google maps, you're using our imagery.
719400	722860	If you've ever used Apple maps, you're using our imagery.
722860	727620	If you ever look and do a crowdsourcing project in OpenStreetMap, you're using our imagery
727620	728780	as well.
728780	734340	But perhaps the single most promising use of earth imagery is with autonomous vehicles.
734340	740140	Having good, solid, current satellite imagery is an integral part of how autonomous vehicles
740140	741140	work.
741140	745940	These vehicles can't just rely on their internal sensors to understand their surroundings—they
745940	748040	get a view from above.
748040	754100	As we think about autonomous vehicles, it's not okay to update the image once a quarter,
754100	757900	once a year, even once a week.
757900	762540	They really need imagery that's coming in much, much faster than that to deal with changes
762540	766980	in traffic conditions, changes in roads, crashes, etc.
766980	771360	Uber, which is developing autonomous cars, is already a customer of Digital Globe for
771360	775720	navigation purposes and as more and more companies move into the autonomous vehicle
775720	780240	race, the competition between earth observation companies for their business is likely to
780240	781240	heat up.
781240	785840	There are plenty of other emerging uses as well which, as an ensemble, are growing the
785840	788360	demand for earth imagery day by day.
788360	792160	It is a tremendously fast growing industry.
792160	795560	But satellite imagery by itself really isn't worth much.
795560	797120	You need something more.
797120	804000	I would say that our customers are demanding more actionable information faster than ever.
804000	806560	Translation—customers want data.
806560	810400	They want the information embedded in the images.
810400	813560	For that, there's another company—Radiant Solutions.
813560	819800	So today customers, the big challenge is around where it used to be more of a, hey we just
819800	825080	need to get an answer, now it's more of how do we deal with all of this data and how
825080	829200	do we answer the more complex questions because they are getting more complex and they're
829200	833560	getting even harder to answer now by virtue of being inundated with data.
833560	837920	Radiant Solutions would describe themselves as a geospatial analytics company.
837920	841200	They take satellite imagery and translate it into information.
841200	846440	We're able to take in vast amounts of data and make sense of it to produce insight.
846440	848200	They answer big questions.
848200	852720	A logging company might ask a question like, what's the density of trees in this particular
852720	857880	region of Canada before purchasing new land and Radiant would be able to look at hundreds
857880	862540	or thousands or millions of square miles of imagery to tell them how many trees there
862540	863540	are.
863540	868920	Now, with so much imagery and such a big world, you can't just do this all by hand—at
868920	870400	least economically.
870400	874640	For that reason, there's been a huge shift in the geospatial analytics business toward
874640	876920	using artificial intelligence.
876920	880200	We hear more and more now that data is kind of like the new oil.
880200	885000	Well that's sort of true but the data has to be reliable, there has to be high confidence
885000	886000	in the data.
886000	888000	So the AI has to be good.
888000	892240	To train a machine to find a red car, for example, you need to show it thousands or
892240	896400	millions of examples of what a red car looks like, but…
896400	900280	It's very different for a machine to look for a red car in an urban environment as it
900280	902380	is to find a red car in snow.
902380	907520	So not only are you training the models to look for that object, but you also have to
907520	909960	train it on where to find it regionally.
909960	916360	It is hugely complicated, but that's why these guys are in business—to answer complicated
916360	917500	questions.
917500	920840	Some data, however, isn't in the visual spectrum.
920840	925840	Some data is hidden, but luckily there's a special satellite just for that.
925840	930400	In the old days, it was just please get me good, solid image pixels to use and I'll
930400	932280	go figure out how to use them.
932280	937500	Today, particularly in the commercial space, it's all about information.
937500	940900	That's Paul Kennedy—Vice President of Ground Systems at MDA.
940900	944500	They've been in business since 1969.
944500	948860	Their most visible project was on developing the Canadarm for the space shuttles and International
948860	949980	Space Station.
949980	954380	As a long-time player in the industry, they serve a variety of functions from developing
954380	959480	space robotics to building satellite ground stations, but one of their most valuable assets
959480	962820	is that special satellite—Radarsat-2.
962820	967380	While most earth observation satellites image using the visual spectrum, what we can see
967380	971260	with our own eyes, Radarsat-2 uses radar.
971260	973600	Radar is an active pulse.
973600	982300	So the satellite actually sends a beam of energy to the ground and reads back what it
982300	989800	gets back from the earth and that gives us a couple of interesting advantages in SAR.
989800	993300	For one, radar can see through clouds and darkness.
993300	998140	It doesn't matter what the light and weather conditions are, it's all the same for Radarsat-2.
998140	1004240	Now, MDA is a Canadian company and it's no coincidence that a Canadian company operates
1004240	1005540	this satellite.
1005540	1010100	Just like the US government is a major customer of Digital Globe, the Canadian government
1010100	1015540	is a major customer of MDA and here's the thing about Canada—the weather is terrible
1015540	1017060	and it's always dark.
1017060	1021660	Quite literally in northern Canada where the sun stays down for the entire winter.
1021660	1025940	It's no coincidence that the company that works so closely with the Canadian government
1025940	1029540	operates the satellite that can see through clouds and night.
1029540	1033980	Without Radarsat-2, the Canadian government would be blind—they would have no way of
1033980	1039460	monitoring huge swaths of their territory in the high arctic for months out of the year.
1039460	1044140	With new launch providers emerging such as Blue Origin and Rocket Lab and SpaceX, the
1044140	1047540	cost of launching material into space is plummeting.
1047540	1052220	Now, this is useful to these companies, at least in some ways.
1052220	1056660	With lower launch costs, Digital Globe and MDA can launch more satellites which means
1056660	1061980	more data for radiant solutions, but that also makes it easier for competitors to launch
1061980	1062980	satellites.
1062980	1067080	The earth imagery business is growing but so is the competition.
1067080	1072820	The best known earth imagery startup, Planet, is launching a constellation of small satellites.
1072820	1077060	While Digital Globe's satellites are the size of a bus, Planet's smallest are the
1077060	1079100	size of a toaster.
1079100	1082780	With the smaller size, development and launch costs are lower.
1082780	1087400	While in the past starting a space imagery company required hundreds of millions or billions
1087400	1092960	of dollars in funding, the emergence of smallsats means that it's enormously easier to break
1092960	1095840	into the satellite imagery business nowadays.
1095840	1099600	But there is a key difference between these two companies.
1099600	1104600	Digital Globe's satellites capture imagery with a pixel size of 12 inches while Planet's
1104600	1110060	primary satellite constellation captures imagery with a pixel size of 10-15 feet at a much
1110060	1111340	lower cost.
1111340	1115560	There are certain uses for high-resolution imagery and there are certain other uses for
1115560	1121120	low-cost imagery so in some ways, these two companies aren't even direct competitors.
1121120	1126360	Nonetheless, the space industry is changing, growing, and becoming more competitive so
1126360	1129140	the established companies need to adapt.
1129140	1134180	United Launch Alliance knows that, Airbus knows that, Arianespace knows that, and Digital
1134180	1138860	Globe, MDA, and Radiant know that too, so they made a change.
1138860	1141060	These three companies are now one.
1141060	1144980	Along with a fourth company, a spacecraft manufacturing company called SSL that will
1144980	1150140	be covered in a future video, these are the entities that make up the newest powerhouse
1150140	1152500	in the space technology business.
1152500	1156900	This merger wasn't necessarily in response to heavy competition but rather, at least
1156900	1162000	from an outsider's perspective, a preemptive strike to establish themselves as a major
1162000	1166940	international player before the commercial space industry truly lifts off.
1166940	1173140	Increasingly, the more traditional aerospace and defense companies that have been supplying
1173140	1181140	technology in space have been able to provide the performance but the cost has been extremely
1181140	1182140	high.
1182140	1185660	Maxar is now a fully vertically integrated company.
1185660	1189760	In the earth imagery space, for example, they'll do everything from building satellites to
1189760	1192680	operating them to extracting data from imagery.
1192680	1197260	By performing all the steps in this process internally, Maxar lowers its costs and this
1197260	1202500	also puts them in the same league as Airbus as one of the very few end-to-end integrated
1202500	1204380	space companies.
1204380	1209460	The commercial space industry as a whole is doing a phenomenal job of making access to
1209460	1211760	orbital space commonplace.
1212280	1221060	The routine steps of space activities are slowly being ceded to private enterprise that
1221060	1222640	could do it faster, better, cheaper.
1222640	1227120	We're now at a place where launching a satellite to low earth orbit is unexceptional.
1227120	1232640	That's exactly what we want—easy access to space—and for near space, that exists
1232640	1233960	right now.
1233960	1239480	Getting beyond earth's orbit, though, outside our cosmic neighborhood, into deep space,
1239480	1241260	that's still tough.
1241260	1246740	The problem is that private enterprise, by its very nature, needs to make money.
1246740	1250260	Companies and their leaders are beholden to their investors to make money.
1250260	1252900	If they're not, then they're not a company.
1252900	1257260	Companies can and do make money with deep space but only through developing and building
1257260	1260780	technologies for NASA and other government agencies.
1260780	1265460	There is zero commercial demand for deep space technology today.
1265460	1271620	Going to new planets, to new solar systems, exploring space, that really doesn't make
1271620	1272980	money.
1272980	1277440	Many people who think about commercial space, I think they're over-predicting what their
1277440	1278440	role will be.
1278440	1282060	They're imagining commercial space leading a space frontier.
1282060	1288120	But to lead a space frontier is expensive and it's not an obvious return on the investment.
1288120	1289580	You might do it as a vanity project.
1289580	1293300	If there are enough billionaires in the world, they could all pool their money.
1293300	1298300	Jeff Bezos, Bill Gates, Elon Musk.
1298300	1302100	They could do a vanity project and send humans to Mars, let's say.
1302100	1307220	But that's not a business model and it would get a lot of attention but is that something
1307220	1308220	you can sustain?
1308220	1309220	No.
1309220	1311100	It would be a one-off.
1311100	1316560	When people imagine a future of space and industry, they're imagining a sustained
1316560	1318060	business case.
1318060	1322600	Of course, you could have said the same thing about the space race 60 years ago.
1322600	1328220	That was exploration, however, in the long term, it was an investment that paid off because
1328220	1331600	space now makes money.
1331600	1337000	Space today is an integral part of what we know and what we can do on the surface of
1337000	1339000	the planet.
1339000	1347920	Communications, imagery, climate science, defense and intelligence and security applications,
1347920	1354880	all of those are seamlessly enabled by space technologies without most of us who go through
1354880	1358800	our daily lives not even thinking about it.
1358800	1363160	The difference between commercial enterprise and governments is time.
1363160	1367520	Commercial enterprises need to think about investments that pay off within the lifetime
1367520	1368520	of their shareholders.
1368520	1373880	So you're always thinking about what is the return on the investment you're making?
1373880	1378560	How long will it take you to achieve the returns on the investment?
1378560	1384200	And what's the probability that the R&D you're putting in will be successful?
1384200	1388600	While companies look at investments in terms of years, governments can look at investments
1388600	1394260	in terms of decades or centuries because governments transcend generations.
1394260	1398640	The innovation that will occur by bringing humans to Mars and beyond will absolutely
1398640	1400640	make money in the very long term.
1400640	1406300	But right now, it would take an enormous amount of money that few people want to risk.
1406300	1410760	You could point to Elon Musk as an exception to this rule—he more than anyone understands
1410760	1415920	the value of super long-term investments like going to Mars—but he also understands that
1415920	1417760	he's alone in that.
1417760	1422160	Individuals don't want to invest in something that won't make money until after they're
1422160	1423160	dead.
1423160	1428120	Musk has stated that he has no plans to take SpaceX public until after a successful mission
1428120	1433960	to Mars which means that, for the moment, the company is almost acting more as an organization.
1433960	1438920	He's funneling the money from launches, which make money, into exploration, which
1438920	1439920	doesn't.
1439920	1445280	Governments need to lead the way because they have the longer time horizons that they can
1445280	1448600	think about and monetize.
1448600	1454740	When they do that, once they lead the way they have now quantified the risks and you
1454740	1460280	know the costs and where the friendlies are and the hostels and whatever are the things
1460280	1464900	that would compromise your mission, they've already figured this out.
1464900	1468700	Then if they do it right, you then hand that to private industry that then makes a buck
1468700	1472540	off of it, then the government can tax that if they so choose.
1472540	1477480	Maxar Technologies and its four businesses meanwhile absolutely innovate including in
1477480	1481900	deep space technologies, but they're not going to put the pieces together to go to
1481900	1486320	Mars by themselves because that's not a good investment.
1486320	1490760	One should be careful to realize that this coming era of commercialized space does not
1490760	1494940	necessarily translate into a renaissance of space exploration.
1494940	1501140	Commercial industry is not a substitute for NASA or the ESA or any other government institution.
1501140	1502660	They are collaborators.
1502660	1507180	They can make the government's job easier and cheaper, but they cannot replace those
1507180	1510760	whose jobs are to go where no human has gone before.
1510760	1517000	The next few decades and centuries can be the era of space exploration but for that,
1517000	1521900	you need a public, you need an electorate that understands that anything good, anything
1521900	1527120	truly worthwhile, takes time.
1527120	1532080	There are so many thanks I have to give for help with this video but one is to Away, not
1532080	1536400	only for making this video possible through sponsorship, but also for literally carrying
1536400	1542000	my possessions over the 15,000 miles I traveled while making this video, and unfortunately
1542000	1543280	that number is not a mistake.
1543280	1547980	I've now owned my Away suitcase for almost a year, have traveled all over the world with
1547980	1549640	it, and I love it.
1549640	1554480	The suitcase is just solidly built, you can feel it, and it has a built-in yet removable
1554480	1559440	battery, a laundry bag, a laptop sleeve, and a compression system so you can pack more
1559440	1561340	into a smaller space.
1561340	1566040	Best of all, for how good it is, the Away suitcase is sold for an amazing price and
1566040	1571260	it's at an even more amazing price if you go to awaytravel.com slash wendover and use
1571260	1575600	the code wendover at checkout to get $20 off your Away suitcase.
1575600	1579880	They're so confident that you'll love the product that all Away suitcases have a
1579880	1583920	lifetime warranty and a 100-day unconditional return policy.
1583920	1589160	It's quite literally no risk and they made this enormous video possible so if you need
1589160	1594760	a suitcase for life, check out awaytravel.com slash wendover and use the code wendover at
1594760	1595760	checkout.
1595760	1600440	I also have to give a huge thanks to Maxar Technologies, especially Kristen Karringer
1600440	1605440	and Turner Brinton, for letting me film this video as it takes an enormous amount of work
1605440	1608800	to allow cameras into such a high-security environment.
1608800	1612800	Lastly, as I mentioned at the beginning, I appeared on Neil deGrasse Tyson's show Star
1612800	1617360	Talk and also launched a new personal channel where I made a behind-the-scenes video for
1617360	1618360	that appearance.
1618360	1621660	Both are linked in the description and on screen now.
1621660	1625280	Thanks again for watching and I'll see you again in three weeks for another Wendover
1625280	1626460	Productions video.
