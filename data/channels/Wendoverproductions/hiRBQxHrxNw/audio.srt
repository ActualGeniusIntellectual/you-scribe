00:00:10,860 --> 00:00:14,940
And quickly, once you've finished this video there are two others to watch—a behind-the-scenes

5
00:00:14,940 --> 00:00:19,340
video on my brand new personal channel and my appearance on StarTalk where I appear on

6
00:00:19,340 --> 00:00:21,140
camera for the first time.

7
00:00:21,140 --> 00:00:22,620
Both are linked in the description.

8
00:00:22,620 --> 00:00:28,580
Suppose we're in a cave right now, this is a cave, and there's maybe ten of us.

9
00:00:28,580 --> 00:00:31,300
We have a mini family tribe.

10
00:00:31,300 --> 00:00:35,120
And I say, you know, I want to go out and see what's on the other side of that mountain.

11
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:36,840
We can see it from here.

12
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:41,060
And then you say, no, no, we have cave problems you have to fix first.

13
00:00:41,060 --> 00:00:45,220
Fix all the cave problems first, then you can go out on the mountain.

14
00:00:45,220 --> 00:00:50,180
And that's what it sounds like to me when I hear people say, we have problems on Earth,

15
00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:52,860
let's fix those before we go into space.

16
00:00:52,860 --> 00:00:59,700
And here's Earth, this speck of dirt orbiting an ordinary star and there's this vastness

17
00:00:59,700 --> 00:01:04,700
of the universe that is waiting for us.

18
00:01:04,700 --> 00:01:06,700
It beckons.

19
00:01:11,740 --> 00:01:14,180
The commercial space industry is heating up.

20
00:01:14,180 --> 00:01:18,460
Fifty years ago, outer space was reserved for the most powerful of nations—the most

21
00:01:18,460 --> 00:01:19,460
dominant governments.

22
00:01:19,740 --> 00:01:23,180
But today, there's a democratization of space.

23
00:01:23,180 --> 00:01:27,060
Commercial industry is inching us closer to the cosmos, and in the process, there's

24
00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:31,420
a growing interdependence between what's happening hundreds of miles up in space and

25
00:01:31,420 --> 00:01:33,080
down below on Earth.

26
00:01:33,080 --> 00:01:37,900
The commercial space industry—using multi-million dollar satellites and rockets—is increasingly

27
00:01:37,900 --> 00:01:40,260
playing a part in our everyday lives.

28
00:01:40,260 --> 00:01:42,980
You may think of this industry as a new phenomenon.

29
00:01:42,980 --> 00:01:47,900
You may have only started hearing about profit-seeking space enterprise in the past few years, but

30
00:01:48,340 --> 00:01:51,340
in reality, this has been going on for decades.

31
00:01:56,340 --> 00:02:01,460
Our founder, Walter Scott, founded the company in his garage in Palo Alto twenty-five years

32
00:02:01,460 --> 00:02:02,460
ago.

33
00:02:02,460 --> 00:02:03,460
This is Dan Jablonski.

34
00:02:03,460 --> 00:02:07,460
He's president of one of the commercial space companies that you might not have heard

35
00:02:07,460 --> 00:02:09,140
of—Digital Globe.

36
00:02:09,140 --> 00:02:13,380
They might not be as flashy as SpaceX or as exciting as Virgin Galactic, but they've

37
00:02:13,380 --> 00:02:17,840
been flying satellites since before Elon Musk even graduated college.

38
00:02:18,780 --> 00:02:22,620
In fact, they were the very first American company to be granted a license to take high

39
00:02:22,620 --> 00:02:28,380
resolution pictures from space and that is essentially what they do—they take pictures

40
00:02:28,380 --> 00:02:32,040
from space, but it's a lot more complicated than it sounds.

41
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:36,880
To take those images from space, you need satellites and Digital Globe has five of them.

42
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:42,000
So the five satellites we have on orbit are GOI-1, Worldview-1, Worldview-2, Worldview-3,

43
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,520
and you're noticing a trend here, Worldview-4.

44
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:47,480
The first of those was launched in 2007.

45
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:52,760
The most recent was launched in 2016 and they have an expected life of over ten years

46
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:53,760
each.

47
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:56,160
And these are really good satellites.

48
00:02:56,160 --> 00:03:01,980
Worldview-4, for example, Digital Globe's newest satellite, has a pixel size of 12 inches.

49
00:03:01,980 --> 00:03:08,300
That means that this satellite, orbiting 383 miles above earth, can clearly see a single

50
00:03:08,300 --> 00:03:10,720
sheet of paper placed in a parking lot.

51
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:15,040
Horizontally, that's like if a camera in Toronto took a picture that could clearly

52
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:19,440
identify the individual eyes of the Statue of Liberty in New York.

53
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:22,600
It is insanely high resolution.

54
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:26,200
With a 30 centimeter pixel you can actually pick up road markings.

55
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:29,160
You can see the lines on the road whether they're straight or dashed lines.

56
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:33,520
You can see whether there are turn arrows there, whether there's a stop word on the

57
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:34,520
road markings.

58
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:38,060
You can even pick up some of the traffic signs and traffic light sizes.

59
00:03:38,060 --> 00:03:43,600
The potential uses of such high quality imagery are endless, but how do the satellites even

60
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:44,600
work?

61
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:48,280
It's good to know that our satellites are in a low earth orbit which means that they

62
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:52,080
actually don't—they're not like a geo-satellite that sits up in a fixed orbit and stays over

63
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:53,200
one place on the planet.

64
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:57,360
Some satellites are specifically designed to stay directly over one position for their

65
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:59,100
whole service lives.

66
00:03:59,100 --> 00:04:03,640
Their orbits are significantly higher above earth so the time it takes for them to complete

67
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:09,360
an orbit is exactly the same as the time it takes the earth to make a full rotation so,

68
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:12,960
relative to earth, the satellite doesn't move at all.

69
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:16,680
This is incredibly useful for certain uses like communications.

70
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:22,500
When a communications company launches a satellite to broadcast TV or radio or internet, they

71
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:26,360
want that satellite to stay over their particular service area.

72
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:31,040
DirecTV, for example, the American satellite TV company, want their satellites to stay

73
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:34,480
over the US because that's their service area.

74
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:38,260
If they weren't able to put their satellites into geo-synchronous orbit, they would have

75
00:04:38,260 --> 00:04:43,340
to launch enough satellites to cover the entire world even if they were only broadcasting

76
00:04:43,340 --> 00:04:44,340
to the US.

77
00:04:44,340 --> 00:04:49,700
So, DirecTV want their satellites to stay over one area because they're broadcasting

78
00:04:49,700 --> 00:04:55,100
to one area, but Digital Globe, on the other hand, want their satellites to move because

79
00:04:55,100 --> 00:04:58,100
they're imaging the entire world.

80
00:04:58,100 --> 00:05:01,660
Each of our satellites right now are in sun synchronous orbits.

81
00:05:01,660 --> 00:05:05,600
So what that means is that the orbital plane that the satellite is flying around in stays

82
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:09,600
in the same orientation relative to the sun all the time.

83
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:14,280
Simplified, that means that any given satellite passes over any given location on earth at

84
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:16,800
the exact same time every day.

85
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:22,160
Worldview 3, for example, always orbits above the points on earth where it's 1030 AM.

86
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:26,760
When it passes over Denver it's 1030 in Denver, when it passes over Paris it's 1030

87
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:31,000
in Paris, and when it passes over Tokyo it's 1030 in Tokyo.

88
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:35,520
How this works is that essentially, with each pass over the light side of earth, the orbit

89
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:40,460
advances relative to the earth at the same rate as the sunlight advances.

90
00:05:40,460 --> 00:05:45,840
This orbit type is crucial because a lot of what satellite imaging is about is detecting

91
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:51,920
change from day to day, month to month, or year to year, and an image taken at 1030 AM

92
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:55,760
is going to look very different than one taken at 6 PM.

93
00:05:55,760 --> 00:06:01,000
This orbit type allows the satellite to pass over the entirety of earth once per day at

94
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:04,640
the same time so the light conditions look the same.

95
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:09,320
The satellites do, of course, need to be told what to do and that all comes down to four

96
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:11,420
people in one room.

97
00:06:11,420 --> 00:06:15,080
So this is our mission operations control center.

98
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:19,720
This is where we fly the five satellites on orbit and really inside this room is what

99
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:25,620
we consider our time-dominant, real-time activities from choosing, making the final choices of

100
00:06:25,620 --> 00:06:31,000
what images we're going to collect in the next several minutes to the next several hours.

101
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:35,540
These four individuals are controlling billions of dollars worth of satellites.

102
00:06:35,540 --> 00:06:41,000
This whole company—the thousands of employees and hundreds of millions of dollars in revenue—all

103
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:46,620
exist to organize and fund what these four individuals are doing—sitting and piloting

104
00:06:46,620 --> 00:06:48,840
the satellites above in space.

105
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:53,960
The mission operations center is, of course, staffed 24-7 since, while it's nighttime

106
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:57,360
in the US, it's daytime in Asia and Australia.

107
00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:01,720
The satellite vehicle operator's main task is to load plans onto the satellites of which

108
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:06,320
images to take when, to monitor that the satellites are operating correctly, and to assure that

109
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:09,820
the satellites won't collide with other satellites or space junk.

110
00:07:09,820 --> 00:07:14,000
The central screens at the front show the current locations of each of the five satellites

111
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:18,780
while the one to the left displays other information such as the total number of times each satellite

112
00:07:18,780 --> 00:07:23,580
has orbited around the earth and how much time they have until the satellite loses signal.

113
00:07:23,580 --> 00:07:27,900
You see, in order for satellites to function, they need to be able to communicate with the

114
00:07:27,900 --> 00:07:31,420
ground and that's done with ground stations.

115
00:07:31,420 --> 00:07:36,220
These antennas communicate to satellites using what are essentially super high-powered wifi

116
00:07:36,220 --> 00:07:37,220
signals.

117
00:07:37,220 --> 00:07:41,740
The ground station's digital globe users are able to receive about a gigabyte of information

118
00:07:41,740 --> 00:07:44,220
every second from the satellites.

119
00:07:44,220 --> 00:07:47,940
Each of those antennas around the world see each satellite several times a day and so

120
00:07:47,940 --> 00:07:53,660
is that, as we go through the day, we accumulate about 7 terabytes of raw imagery off the satellites

121
00:07:53,660 --> 00:07:56,060
through that gigabit connection.

122
00:07:56,060 --> 00:07:59,780
Satellites can only communicate with the ground stations while they have a line of sight with

123
00:07:59,780 --> 00:08:05,220
the antenna so, due to the curvature of the earth, in the view of any given ground station,

124
00:08:05,220 --> 00:08:07,980
the satellite will eventually dip below the horizon.

125
00:08:07,980 --> 00:08:12,600
Therefore, each ground station only has a limited operating range.

126
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:16,620
The exact locations of ground stations are, understandably, kept secret, but if there

127
00:08:16,620 --> 00:08:20,600
was one in Germany, for example, it would communicate with the digital globe satellites

128
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:23,540
exclusively while they passed over Europe.

129
00:08:23,540 --> 00:08:28,300
The fact that these satellites have to, by nature, pass over the entire world is actually,

130
00:08:28,300 --> 00:08:30,140
however, quite useful.

131
00:08:30,140 --> 00:08:34,820
Not only does this let digital globe map the entire world, but they also use the extra

132
00:08:34,820 --> 00:08:37,340
capacity for humanitarian efforts.

133
00:08:37,340 --> 00:08:42,420
It's actually easier for us on the humanitarian global development side because we have much

134
00:08:42,420 --> 00:08:45,300
more capacity over a lot of these areas.

135
00:08:45,300 --> 00:08:50,740
There's a lot more demand for our satellites over developed countries, for instance, right?

136
00:08:50,740 --> 00:08:56,060
So people are typically, for commercial applications, much more interested in the U.S. or Europe

137
00:08:56,060 --> 00:09:01,500
or some of these more developed areas versus sub-Saharan Africa where we, just generally

138
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:06,460
speaking, have much more ability to task the constellation and to collect those imagery.

139
00:09:06,460 --> 00:09:11,980
So it's actually an opportunity for us to support those use cases much more than others.

140
00:09:11,980 --> 00:09:16,080
For instance, Digital Globe partners with the Gates Foundation to map every single building

141
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:21,220
structure in rural Zambia so aid workers now know things like how many bed nets, vaccines,

142
00:09:21,220 --> 00:09:24,860
or food to bring to communities that were previously unmapped.

143
00:09:24,860 --> 00:09:30,780
There are few companies the size of commercial space companies that rely on so few assets.

144
00:09:30,780 --> 00:09:35,980
What makes Digital Globe, for example, run are those five satellites and to get those

145
00:09:35,980 --> 00:09:40,640
to space, to the place where they make money, they had to put them on rockets which tend

146
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:43,120
to, from time to time, blow up.

147
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:46,640
It's always a little bit of a nail biter as you come up to a launch.

148
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:51,880
We put an enormous capital investment into the satellites and the launch vehicle and

149
00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:56,320
it all comes down to a one hour event—lifting off from the ground and going into orbit and

150
00:09:56,320 --> 00:10:00,040
that's a, that can be a little bit of a nerve-wracking period but certainly very exciting

151
00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:01,600
at the same time.

152
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:07,240
An average of one in twenty rocket launches fail and then, on top of that, some satellites

153
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:11,360
fail once they reach orbit which makes the space business risky.

154
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:15,680
Companies like Digital Globe will therefore purchase enormously expensive insurance policies

155
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:19,960
on their satellites in case the launch or the satellite itself fails.

156
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:24,280
If they didn't, one bad launch could spell the end for the company.

157
00:10:24,280 --> 00:10:28,280
Of course, some launch providers are much more reliable than others.

158
00:10:28,280 --> 00:10:31,840
United Launch Alliance, the launch provider that Digital Globe used for their current

159
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:36,560
five satellites, has not had a launch failure in its eleven year history.

160
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:40,880
Insurance rates for ULA would be relatively low while insurance rates for a newer launch

161
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:45,160
provider, such as Orbital ATK or Blue Origin, would be comparatively high.

162
00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:50,160
Nonetheless, the cost of newer launch providers with insurance included is now often less

163
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:52,800
than the older, more reliable launch companies.

164
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:55,500
But how does Digital Globe fund their exploits?

165
00:10:55,500 --> 00:10:57,580
What keeps those satellites flying?

166
00:10:57,580 --> 00:10:59,560
How do they make their money?

167
00:10:59,560 --> 00:11:02,800
Our largest customer is the US government and we've been very proud to be their mission

168
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:06,760
partner for over a decade and a half coming up on two decades now.

169
00:11:06,760 --> 00:11:12,360
It used to be that the commercial satellite industry was essentially focused on one major

170
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:14,180
customer—governments.

171
00:11:14,180 --> 00:11:19,060
In the past, the US government has been the single largest customer of the few commercial

172
00:11:19,060 --> 00:11:23,440
space companies that there were thanks to its enormous defense spending, but today as

173
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:29,060
commercial customers contract commercial space companies, the business is spreading globally.

174
00:11:29,060 --> 00:11:34,820
Over the past decade, the customer base has become more international and more diversified.

175
00:11:34,820 --> 00:11:41,240
Our other customers are international customers who may be US allies or maybe technology companies

176
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:42,700
across the world.

177
00:11:42,700 --> 00:11:48,220
We go deep in the telecommunications infrastructure, online mapping, energy industries, mining

178
00:11:48,220 --> 00:11:50,380
industries, forestry applications.

179
00:11:50,380 --> 00:11:55,500
There's really a huge variety of customers, but the most obvious ones are those mapping

180
00:11:55,500 --> 00:11:56,500
companies.

181
00:11:56,500 --> 00:11:59,400
If you've ever used Google maps, you're using our imagery.

182
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:02,860
If you've ever used Apple maps, you're using our imagery.

183
00:12:02,860 --> 00:12:07,620
If you ever look and do a crowdsourcing project in OpenStreetMap, you're using our imagery

184
00:12:07,620 --> 00:12:08,780
as well.

185
00:12:08,780 --> 00:12:14,340
But perhaps the single most promising use of earth imagery is with autonomous vehicles.

186
00:12:14,340 --> 00:12:20,140
Having good, solid, current satellite imagery is an integral part of how autonomous vehicles

187
00:12:20,140 --> 00:12:21,140
work.

188
00:12:21,140 --> 00:12:25,940
These vehicles can't just rely on their internal sensors to understand their surroundings—they

189
00:12:25,940 --> 00:12:28,040
get a view from above.

190
00:12:28,040 --> 00:12:34,100
As we think about autonomous vehicles, it's not okay to update the image once a quarter,

191
00:12:34,100 --> 00:12:37,900
once a year, even once a week.

192
00:12:37,900 --> 00:12:42,540
They really need imagery that's coming in much, much faster than that to deal with changes

193
00:12:42,540 --> 00:12:46,980
in traffic conditions, changes in roads, crashes, etc.

194
00:12:46,980 --> 00:12:51,360
Uber, which is developing autonomous cars, is already a customer of Digital Globe for

195
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:55,720
navigation purposes and as more and more companies move into the autonomous vehicle

196
00:12:55,720 --> 00:13:00,240
race, the competition between earth observation companies for their business is likely to

197
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:01,240
heat up.

198
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:05,840
There are plenty of other emerging uses as well which, as an ensemble, are growing the

199
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:08,360
demand for earth imagery day by day.

200
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:12,160
It is a tremendously fast growing industry.

201
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:15,560
But satellite imagery by itself really isn't worth much.

202
00:13:15,560 --> 00:13:17,120
You need something more.

203
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:24,000
I would say that our customers are demanding more actionable information faster than ever.

204
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,560
Translation—customers want data.

205
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:30,400
They want the information embedded in the images.

206
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:33,560
For that, there's another company—Radiant Solutions.

207
00:13:33,560 --> 00:13:39,800
So today customers, the big challenge is around where it used to be more of a, hey we just

208
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:45,080
need to get an answer, now it's more of how do we deal with all of this data and how

209
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:49,200
do we answer the more complex questions because they are getting more complex and they're

210
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:53,560
getting even harder to answer now by virtue of being inundated with data.

211
00:13:53,560 --> 00:13:57,920
Radiant Solutions would describe themselves as a geospatial analytics company.

212
00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:01,200
They take satellite imagery and translate it into information.

213
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:06,440
We're able to take in vast amounts of data and make sense of it to produce insight.

214
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:08,200
They answer big questions.

215
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:12,720
A logging company might ask a question like, what's the density of trees in this particular

216
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:17,880
region of Canada before purchasing new land and Radiant would be able to look at hundreds

217
00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:22,540
or thousands or millions of square miles of imagery to tell them how many trees there

218
00:14:22,540 --> 00:14:23,540
are.

219
00:14:23,540 --> 00:14:28,920
Now, with so much imagery and such a big world, you can't just do this all by hand—at

220
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:30,400
least economically.

221
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:34,640
For that reason, there's been a huge shift in the geospatial analytics business toward

222
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:36,920
using artificial intelligence.

223
00:14:36,920 --> 00:14:40,200
We hear more and more now that data is kind of like the new oil.

224
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:45,000
Well that's sort of true but the data has to be reliable, there has to be high confidence

225
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,000
in the data.

226
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
So the AI has to be good.

227
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:52,240
To train a machine to find a red car, for example, you need to show it thousands or

228
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:56,400
millions of examples of what a red car looks like, but…

229
00:14:56,400 --> 00:15:00,280
It's very different for a machine to look for a red car in an urban environment as it

230
00:15:00,280 --> 00:15:02,380
is to find a red car in snow.

231
00:15:02,380 --> 00:15:07,520
So not only are you training the models to look for that object, but you also have to

232
00:15:07,520 --> 00:15:09,960
train it on where to find it regionally.

233
00:15:09,960 --> 00:15:16,360
It is hugely complicated, but that's why these guys are in business—to answer complicated

234
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:17,500
questions.

235
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:20,840
Some data, however, isn't in the visual spectrum.

236
00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:25,840
Some data is hidden, but luckily there's a special satellite just for that.

237
00:15:25,840 --> 00:15:30,400
In the old days, it was just please get me good, solid image pixels to use and I'll

238
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:32,280
go figure out how to use them.

239
00:15:32,280 --> 00:15:37,500
Today, particularly in the commercial space, it's all about information.

240
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:40,900
That's Paul Kennedy—Vice President of Ground Systems at MDA.

241
00:15:40,900 --> 00:15:44,500
They've been in business since 1969.

242
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:48,860
Their most visible project was on developing the Canadarm for the space shuttles and International

243
00:15:48,860 --> 00:15:49,980
Space Station.

244
00:15:49,980 --> 00:15:54,380
As a long-time player in the industry, they serve a variety of functions from developing

245
00:15:54,380 --> 00:15:59,480
space robotics to building satellite ground stations, but one of their most valuable assets

246
00:15:59,480 --> 00:16:02,820
is that special satellite—Radarsat-2.

247
00:16:02,820 --> 00:16:07,380
While most earth observation satellites image using the visual spectrum, what we can see

248
00:16:07,380 --> 00:16:11,260
with our own eyes, Radarsat-2 uses radar.

249
00:16:11,260 --> 00:16:13,600
Radar is an active pulse.

250
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:22,300
So the satellite actually sends a beam of energy to the ground and reads back what it

251
00:16:22,300 --> 00:16:29,800
gets back from the earth and that gives us a couple of interesting advantages in SAR.

252
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:33,300
For one, radar can see through clouds and darkness.

253
00:16:33,300 --> 00:16:38,140
It doesn't matter what the light and weather conditions are, it's all the same for Radarsat-2.

254
00:16:38,140 --> 00:16:44,240
Now, MDA is a Canadian company and it's no coincidence that a Canadian company operates

255
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:45,540
this satellite.

256
00:16:45,540 --> 00:16:50,100
Just like the US government is a major customer of Digital Globe, the Canadian government

257
00:16:50,100 --> 00:16:55,540
is a major customer of MDA and here's the thing about Canada—the weather is terrible

258
00:16:55,540 --> 00:16:57,060
and it's always dark.

259
00:16:57,060 --> 00:17:01,660
Quite literally in northern Canada where the sun stays down for the entire winter.

260
00:17:01,660 --> 00:17:05,940
It's no coincidence that the company that works so closely with the Canadian government

261
00:17:05,940 --> 00:17:09,540
operates the satellite that can see through clouds and night.

262
00:17:09,540 --> 00:17:13,980
Without Radarsat-2, the Canadian government would be blind—they would have no way of

263
00:17:13,980 --> 00:17:19,460
monitoring huge swaths of their territory in the high arctic for months out of the year.

264
00:17:19,460 --> 00:17:24,140
With new launch providers emerging such as Blue Origin and Rocket Lab and SpaceX, the

265
00:17:24,140 --> 00:17:27,540
cost of launching material into space is plummeting.

266
00:17:27,540 --> 00:17:32,220
Now, this is useful to these companies, at least in some ways.

267
00:17:32,220 --> 00:17:36,660
With lower launch costs, Digital Globe and MDA can launch more satellites which means

268
00:17:36,660 --> 00:17:41,980
more data for radiant solutions, but that also makes it easier for competitors to launch

269
00:17:41,980 --> 00:17:42,980
satellites.

270
00:17:42,980 --> 00:17:47,080
The earth imagery business is growing but so is the competition.

271
00:17:47,080 --> 00:17:52,820
The best known earth imagery startup, Planet, is launching a constellation of small satellites.

272
00:17:52,820 --> 00:17:57,060
While Digital Globe's satellites are the size of a bus, Planet's smallest are the

273
00:17:57,060 --> 00:17:59,100
size of a toaster.

274
00:17:59,100 --> 00:18:02,780
With the smaller size, development and launch costs are lower.

275
00:18:02,780 --> 00:18:07,400
While in the past starting a space imagery company required hundreds of millions or billions

276
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:12,960
of dollars in funding, the emergence of smallsats means that it's enormously easier to break

277
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:15,840
into the satellite imagery business nowadays.

278
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:19,600
But there is a key difference between these two companies.

279
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:24,600
Digital Globe's satellites capture imagery with a pixel size of 12 inches while Planet's

280
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:30,060
primary satellite constellation captures imagery with a pixel size of 10-15 feet at a much

281
00:18:30,060 --> 00:18:31,340
lower cost.

282
00:18:31,340 --> 00:18:35,560
There are certain uses for high-resolution imagery and there are certain other uses for

283
00:18:35,560 --> 00:18:41,120
low-cost imagery so in some ways, these two companies aren't even direct competitors.

284
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:46,360
Nonetheless, the space industry is changing, growing, and becoming more competitive so

285
00:18:46,360 --> 00:18:49,140
the established companies need to adapt.

286
00:18:49,140 --> 00:18:54,180
United Launch Alliance knows that, Airbus knows that, Arianespace knows that, and Digital

287
00:18:54,180 --> 00:18:58,860
Globe, MDA, and Radiant know that too, so they made a change.

288
00:18:58,860 --> 00:19:01,060
These three companies are now one.

289
00:19:01,060 --> 00:19:04,980
Along with a fourth company, a spacecraft manufacturing company called SSL that will

290
00:19:04,980 --> 00:19:10,140
be covered in a future video, these are the entities that make up the newest powerhouse

291
00:19:10,140 --> 00:19:12,500
in the space technology business.

292
00:19:12,500 --> 00:19:16,900
This merger wasn't necessarily in response to heavy competition but rather, at least

293
00:19:16,900 --> 00:19:22,000
from an outsider's perspective, a preemptive strike to establish themselves as a major

294
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:26,940
international player before the commercial space industry truly lifts off.

295
00:19:26,940 --> 00:19:33,140
Increasingly, the more traditional aerospace and defense companies that have been supplying

296
00:19:33,140 --> 00:19:41,140
technology in space have been able to provide the performance but the cost has been extremely

297
00:19:41,140 --> 00:19:42,140
high.

298
00:19:42,140 --> 00:19:45,660
Maxar is now a fully vertically integrated company.

299
00:19:45,660 --> 00:19:49,760
In the earth imagery space, for example, they'll do everything from building satellites to

300
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:52,680
operating them to extracting data from imagery.

301
00:19:52,680 --> 00:19:57,260
By performing all the steps in this process internally, Maxar lowers its costs and this

302
00:19:57,260 --> 00:20:02,500
also puts them in the same league as Airbus as one of the very few end-to-end integrated

303
00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:04,380
space companies.

304
00:20:04,380 --> 00:20:09,460
The commercial space industry as a whole is doing a phenomenal job of making access to

305
00:20:09,460 --> 00:20:11,760
orbital space commonplace.

306
00:20:12,280 --> 00:20:21,060
The routine steps of space activities are slowly being ceded to private enterprise that

307
00:20:21,060 --> 00:20:22,640
could do it faster, better, cheaper.

308
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:27,120
We're now at a place where launching a satellite to low earth orbit is unexceptional.

309
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:32,640
That's exactly what we want—easy access to space—and for near space, that exists

310
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:33,960
right now.

311
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:39,480
Getting beyond earth's orbit, though, outside our cosmic neighborhood, into deep space,

312
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:41,260
that's still tough.

313
00:20:41,260 --> 00:20:46,740
The problem is that private enterprise, by its very nature, needs to make money.

314
00:20:46,740 --> 00:20:50,260
Companies and their leaders are beholden to their investors to make money.

315
00:20:50,260 --> 00:20:52,900
If they're not, then they're not a company.

316
00:20:52,900 --> 00:20:57,260
Companies can and do make money with deep space but only through developing and building

317
00:20:57,260 --> 00:21:00,780
technologies for NASA and other government agencies.

318
00:21:00,780 --> 00:21:05,460
There is zero commercial demand for deep space technology today.

319
00:21:05,460 --> 00:21:11,620
Going to new planets, to new solar systems, exploring space, that really doesn't make

320
00:21:11,620 --> 00:21:12,980
money.

321
00:21:12,980 --> 00:21:17,440
Many people who think about commercial space, I think they're over-predicting what their

322
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:18,440
role will be.

323
00:21:18,440 --> 00:21:22,060
They're imagining commercial space leading a space frontier.

324
00:21:22,060 --> 00:21:28,120
But to lead a space frontier is expensive and it's not an obvious return on the investment.

325
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:29,580
You might do it as a vanity project.

326
00:21:29,580 --> 00:21:33,300
If there are enough billionaires in the world, they could all pool their money.

327
00:21:33,300 --> 00:21:38,300
Jeff Bezos, Bill Gates, Elon Musk.

328
00:21:38,300 --> 00:21:42,100
They could do a vanity project and send humans to Mars, let's say.

329
00:21:42,100 --> 00:21:47,220
But that's not a business model and it would get a lot of attention but is that something

330
00:21:47,220 --> 00:21:48,220
you can sustain?

331
00:21:48,220 --> 00:21:49,220
No.

332
00:21:49,220 --> 00:21:51,100
It would be a one-off.

333
00:21:51,100 --> 00:21:56,560
When people imagine a future of space and industry, they're imagining a sustained

334
00:21:56,560 --> 00:21:58,060
business case.

335
00:21:58,060 --> 00:22:02,600
Of course, you could have said the same thing about the space race 60 years ago.

336
00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:08,220
That was exploration, however, in the long term, it was an investment that paid off because

337
00:22:08,220 --> 00:22:11,600
space now makes money.

338
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:17,000
Space today is an integral part of what we know and what we can do on the surface of

339
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,000
the planet.

340
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:27,920
Communications, imagery, climate science, defense and intelligence and security applications,

341
00:22:27,920 --> 00:22:34,880
all of those are seamlessly enabled by space technologies without most of us who go through

342
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:38,800
our daily lives not even thinking about it.

343
00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:43,160
The difference between commercial enterprise and governments is time.

344
00:22:43,160 --> 00:22:47,520
Commercial enterprises need to think about investments that pay off within the lifetime

345
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:48,520
of their shareholders.

346
00:22:48,520 --> 00:22:53,880
So you're always thinking about what is the return on the investment you're making?

347
00:22:53,880 --> 00:22:58,560
How long will it take you to achieve the returns on the investment?

348
00:22:58,560 --> 00:23:04,200
And what's the probability that the R&D you're putting in will be successful?

349
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:08,600
While companies look at investments in terms of years, governments can look at investments

350
00:23:08,600 --> 00:23:14,260
in terms of decades or centuries because governments transcend generations.

351
00:23:14,260 --> 00:23:18,640
The innovation that will occur by bringing humans to Mars and beyond will absolutely

352
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:20,640
make money in the very long term.

353
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:26,300
But right now, it would take an enormous amount of money that few people want to risk.

354
00:23:26,300 --> 00:23:30,760
You could point to Elon Musk as an exception to this rule—he more than anyone understands

355
00:23:30,760 --> 00:23:35,920
the value of super long-term investments like going to Mars—but he also understands that

356
00:23:35,920 --> 00:23:37,760
he's alone in that.

357
00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:42,160
Individuals don't want to invest in something that won't make money until after they're

358
00:23:42,160 --> 00:23:43,160
dead.

359
00:23:43,160 --> 00:23:48,120
Musk has stated that he has no plans to take SpaceX public until after a successful mission

360
00:23:48,120 --> 00:23:53,960
to Mars which means that, for the moment, the company is almost acting more as an organization.

361
00:23:53,960 --> 00:23:58,920
He's funneling the money from launches, which make money, into exploration, which

362
00:23:58,920 --> 00:23:59,920
doesn't.

363
00:23:59,920 --> 00:24:05,280
Governments need to lead the way because they have the longer time horizons that they can

364
00:24:05,280 --> 00:24:08,600
think about and monetize.

365
00:24:08,600 --> 00:24:14,740
When they do that, once they lead the way they have now quantified the risks and you

366
00:24:14,740 --> 00:24:20,280
know the costs and where the friendlies are and the hostels and whatever are the things

367
00:24:20,280 --> 00:24:24,900
that would compromise your mission, they've already figured this out.

368
00:24:24,900 --> 00:24:28,700
Then if they do it right, you then hand that to private industry that then makes a buck

369
00:24:28,700 --> 00:24:32,540
off of it, then the government can tax that if they so choose.

370
00:24:32,540 --> 00:24:37,480
Maxar Technologies and its four businesses meanwhile absolutely innovate including in

371
00:24:37,480 --> 00:24:41,900
deep space technologies, but they're not going to put the pieces together to go to

372
00:24:41,900 --> 00:24:46,320
Mars by themselves because that's not a good investment.

373
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:50,760
One should be careful to realize that this coming era of commercialized space does not

374
00:24:50,760 --> 00:24:54,940
necessarily translate into a renaissance of space exploration.

375
00:24:54,940 --> 00:25:01,140
Commercial industry is not a substitute for NASA or the ESA or any other government institution.

376
00:25:01,140 --> 00:25:02,660
They are collaborators.

377
00:25:02,660 --> 00:25:07,180
They can make the government's job easier and cheaper, but they cannot replace those

378
00:25:07,180 --> 00:25:10,760
whose jobs are to go where no human has gone before.

379
00:25:10,760 --> 00:25:17,000
The next few decades and centuries can be the era of space exploration but for that,

380
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:21,900
you need a public, you need an electorate that understands that anything good, anything

381
00:25:21,900 --> 00:25:27,120
truly worthwhile, takes time.

382
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:32,080
There are so many thanks I have to give for help with this video but one is to Away, not

383
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:36,400
only for making this video possible through sponsorship, but also for literally carrying

384
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:42,000
my possessions over the 15,000 miles I traveled while making this video, and unfortunately

385
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:43,280
that number is not a mistake.

386
00:25:43,280 --> 00:25:47,980
I've now owned my Away suitcase for almost a year, have traveled all over the world with

387
00:25:47,980 --> 00:25:49,640
it, and I love it.

388
00:25:49,640 --> 00:25:54,480
The suitcase is just solidly built, you can feel it, and it has a built-in yet removable

389
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:59,440
battery, a laundry bag, a laptop sleeve, and a compression system so you can pack more

390
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:01,340
into a smaller space.

391
00:26:01,340 --> 00:26:06,040
Best of all, for how good it is, the Away suitcase is sold for an amazing price and

392
00:26:06,040 --> 00:26:11,260
it's at an even more amazing price if you go to awaytravel.com slash wendover and use

393
00:26:11,260 --> 00:26:15,600
the code wendover at checkout to get $20 off your Away suitcase.

394
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:19,880
They're so confident that you'll love the product that all Away suitcases have a

395
00:26:19,880 --> 00:26:23,920
lifetime warranty and a 100-day unconditional return policy.

396
00:26:23,920 --> 00:26:29,160
It's quite literally no risk and they made this enormous video possible so if you need

397
00:26:29,160 --> 00:26:34,760
a suitcase for life, check out awaytravel.com slash wendover and use the code wendover at

398
00:26:34,760 --> 00:26:35,760
checkout.

399
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:40,440
I also have to give a huge thanks to Maxar Technologies, especially Kristen Karringer

400
00:26:40,440 --> 00:26:45,440
and Turner Brinton, for letting me film this video as it takes an enormous amount of work

401
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:48,800
to allow cameras into such a high-security environment.

402
00:26:48,800 --> 00:26:52,800
Lastly, as I mentioned at the beginning, I appeared on Neil deGrasse Tyson's show Star

403
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:57,360
Talk and also launched a new personal channel where I made a behind-the-scenes video for

404
00:26:57,360 --> 00:26:58,360
that appearance.

405
00:26:58,360 --> 00:27:01,660
Both are linked in the description and on screen now.

406
00:27:01,660 --> 00:27:05,280
Thanks again for watching and I'll see you again in three weeks for another Wendover

407
00:27:05,280 --> 00:27:06,460
Productions video.
