00:10.860 --> 00:14.940
And quickly, once you've finished this video there are two others to watch—a behind-the-scenes

00:14.940 --> 00:19.340
video on my brand new personal channel and my appearance on StarTalk where I appear on

00:19.340 --> 00:21.140
camera for the first time.

00:21.140 --> 00:22.620
Both are linked in the description.

00:22.620 --> 00:28.580
Suppose we're in a cave right now, this is a cave, and there's maybe ten of us.

00:28.580 --> 00:31.300
We have a mini family tribe.

00:31.300 --> 00:35.120
And I say, you know, I want to go out and see what's on the other side of that mountain.

00:35.120 --> 00:36.840
We can see it from here.

00:36.840 --> 00:41.060
And then you say, no, no, we have cave problems you have to fix first.

00:41.060 --> 00:45.220
Fix all the cave problems first, then you can go out on the mountain.

00:45.220 --> 00:50.180
And that's what it sounds like to me when I hear people say, we have problems on Earth,

00:50.460 --> 00:52.860
let's fix those before we go into space.

00:52.860 --> 00:59.700
And here's Earth, this speck of dirt orbiting an ordinary star and there's this vastness

00:59.700 --> 01:04.700
of the universe that is waiting for us.

01:04.700 --> 01:06.700
It beckons.

01:11.740 --> 01:14.180
The commercial space industry is heating up.

01:14.180 --> 01:18.460
Fifty years ago, outer space was reserved for the most powerful of nations—the most

01:18.460 --> 01:19.460
dominant governments.

01:19.740 --> 01:23.180
But today, there's a democratization of space.

01:23.180 --> 01:27.060
Commercial industry is inching us closer to the cosmos, and in the process, there's

01:27.060 --> 01:31.420
a growing interdependence between what's happening hundreds of miles up in space and

01:31.420 --> 01:33.080
down below on Earth.

01:33.080 --> 01:37.900
The commercial space industry—using multi-million dollar satellites and rockets—is increasingly

01:37.900 --> 01:40.260
playing a part in our everyday lives.

01:40.260 --> 01:42.980
You may think of this industry as a new phenomenon.

01:42.980 --> 01:47.900
You may have only started hearing about profit-seeking space enterprise in the past few years, but

01:48.340 --> 01:51.340
in reality, this has been going on for decades.

01:56.340 --> 02:01.460
Our founder, Walter Scott, founded the company in his garage in Palo Alto twenty-five years

02:01.460 --> 02:02.460
ago.

02:02.460 --> 02:03.460
This is Dan Jablonski.

02:03.460 --> 02:07.460
He's president of one of the commercial space companies that you might not have heard

02:07.460 --> 02:09.140
of—Digital Globe.

02:09.140 --> 02:13.380
They might not be as flashy as SpaceX or as exciting as Virgin Galactic, but they've

02:13.380 --> 02:17.840
been flying satellites since before Elon Musk even graduated college.

02:18.780 --> 02:22.620
In fact, they were the very first American company to be granted a license to take high

02:22.620 --> 02:28.380
resolution pictures from space and that is essentially what they do—they take pictures

02:28.380 --> 02:32.040
from space, but it's a lot more complicated than it sounds.

02:32.040 --> 02:36.880
To take those images from space, you need satellites and Digital Globe has five of them.

02:36.880 --> 02:42.000
So the five satellites we have on orbit are GOI-1, Worldview-1, Worldview-2, Worldview-3,

02:42.000 --> 02:44.520
and you're noticing a trend here, Worldview-4.

02:44.520 --> 02:47.480
The first of those was launched in 2007.

02:47.480 --> 02:52.760
The most recent was launched in 2016 and they have an expected life of over ten years

02:52.760 --> 02:53.760
each.

02:53.760 --> 02:56.160
And these are really good satellites.

02:56.160 --> 03:01.980
Worldview-4, for example, Digital Globe's newest satellite, has a pixel size of 12 inches.

03:01.980 --> 03:08.300
That means that this satellite, orbiting 383 miles above earth, can clearly see a single

03:08.300 --> 03:10.720
sheet of paper placed in a parking lot.

03:10.720 --> 03:15.040
Horizontally, that's like if a camera in Toronto took a picture that could clearly

03:15.040 --> 03:19.440
identify the individual eyes of the Statue of Liberty in New York.

03:19.440 --> 03:22.600
It is insanely high resolution.

03:22.600 --> 03:26.200
With a 30 centimeter pixel you can actually pick up road markings.

03:26.200 --> 03:29.160
You can see the lines on the road whether they're straight or dashed lines.

03:29.160 --> 03:33.520
You can see whether there are turn arrows there, whether there's a stop word on the

03:33.520 --> 03:34.520
road markings.

03:34.520 --> 03:38.060
You can even pick up some of the traffic signs and traffic light sizes.

03:38.060 --> 03:43.600
The potential uses of such high quality imagery are endless, but how do the satellites even

03:43.600 --> 03:44.600
work?

03:45.040 --> 03:48.280
It's good to know that our satellites are in a low earth orbit which means that they

03:48.280 --> 03:52.080
actually don't—they're not like a geo-satellite that sits up in a fixed orbit and stays over

03:52.080 --> 03:53.200
one place on the planet.

03:53.200 --> 03:57.360
Some satellites are specifically designed to stay directly over one position for their

03:57.360 --> 03:59.100
whole service lives.

03:59.100 --> 04:03.640
Their orbits are significantly higher above earth so the time it takes for them to complete

04:03.640 --> 04:09.360
an orbit is exactly the same as the time it takes the earth to make a full rotation so,

04:09.360 --> 04:12.960
relative to earth, the satellite doesn't move at all.

04:12.960 --> 04:16.680
This is incredibly useful for certain uses like communications.

04:16.680 --> 04:22.500
When a communications company launches a satellite to broadcast TV or radio or internet, they

04:22.500 --> 04:26.360
want that satellite to stay over their particular service area.

04:26.360 --> 04:31.040
DirecTV, for example, the American satellite TV company, want their satellites to stay

04:31.040 --> 04:34.480
over the US because that's their service area.

04:34.480 --> 04:38.260
If they weren't able to put their satellites into geo-synchronous orbit, they would have

04:38.260 --> 04:43.340
to launch enough satellites to cover the entire world even if they were only broadcasting

04:43.340 --> 04:44.340
to the US.

04:44.340 --> 04:49.700
So, DirecTV want their satellites to stay over one area because they're broadcasting

04:49.700 --> 04:55.100
to one area, but Digital Globe, on the other hand, want their satellites to move because

04:55.100 --> 04:58.100
they're imaging the entire world.

04:58.100 --> 05:01.660
Each of our satellites right now are in sun synchronous orbits.

05:01.660 --> 05:05.600
So what that means is that the orbital plane that the satellite is flying around in stays

05:05.600 --> 05:09.600
in the same orientation relative to the sun all the time.

05:09.600 --> 05:14.280
Simplified, that means that any given satellite passes over any given location on earth at

05:14.280 --> 05:16.800
the exact same time every day.

05:16.800 --> 05:22.160
Worldview 3, for example, always orbits above the points on earth where it's 1030 AM.

05:22.160 --> 05:26.760
When it passes over Denver it's 1030 in Denver, when it passes over Paris it's 1030

05:26.760 --> 05:31.000
in Paris, and when it passes over Tokyo it's 1030 in Tokyo.

05:31.000 --> 05:35.520
How this works is that essentially, with each pass over the light side of earth, the orbit

05:35.520 --> 05:40.460
advances relative to the earth at the same rate as the sunlight advances.

05:40.460 --> 05:45.840
This orbit type is crucial because a lot of what satellite imaging is about is detecting

05:45.840 --> 05:51.920
change from day to day, month to month, or year to year, and an image taken at 1030 AM

05:51.920 --> 05:55.760
is going to look very different than one taken at 6 PM.

05:55.760 --> 06:01.000
This orbit type allows the satellite to pass over the entirety of earth once per day at

06:01.000 --> 06:04.640
the same time so the light conditions look the same.

06:04.640 --> 06:09.320
The satellites do, of course, need to be told what to do and that all comes down to four

06:09.320 --> 06:11.420
people in one room.

06:11.420 --> 06:15.080
So this is our mission operations control center.

06:15.080 --> 06:19.720
This is where we fly the five satellites on orbit and really inside this room is what

06:19.720 --> 06:25.620
we consider our time-dominant, real-time activities from choosing, making the final choices of

06:25.620 --> 06:31.000
what images we're going to collect in the next several minutes to the next several hours.

06:31.000 --> 06:35.540
These four individuals are controlling billions of dollars worth of satellites.

06:35.540 --> 06:41.000
This whole company—the thousands of employees and hundreds of millions of dollars in revenue—all

06:41.000 --> 06:46.620
exist to organize and fund what these four individuals are doing—sitting and piloting

06:46.620 --> 06:48.840
the satellites above in space.

06:48.840 --> 06:53.960
The mission operations center is, of course, staffed 24-7 since, while it's nighttime

06:53.960 --> 06:57.360
in the US, it's daytime in Asia and Australia.

06:57.360 --> 07:01.720
The satellite vehicle operator's main task is to load plans onto the satellites of which

07:01.720 --> 07:06.320
images to take when, to monitor that the satellites are operating correctly, and to assure that

07:06.320 --> 07:09.820
the satellites won't collide with other satellites or space junk.

07:09.820 --> 07:14.000
The central screens at the front show the current locations of each of the five satellites

07:14.000 --> 07:18.780
while the one to the left displays other information such as the total number of times each satellite

07:18.780 --> 07:23.580
has orbited around the earth and how much time they have until the satellite loses signal.

07:23.580 --> 07:27.900
You see, in order for satellites to function, they need to be able to communicate with the

07:27.900 --> 07:31.420
ground and that's done with ground stations.

07:31.420 --> 07:36.220
These antennas communicate to satellites using what are essentially super high-powered wifi

07:36.220 --> 07:37.220
signals.

07:37.220 --> 07:41.740
The ground station's digital globe users are able to receive about a gigabyte of information

07:41.740 --> 07:44.220
every second from the satellites.

07:44.220 --> 07:47.940
Each of those antennas around the world see each satellite several times a day and so

07:47.940 --> 07:53.660
is that, as we go through the day, we accumulate about 7 terabytes of raw imagery off the satellites

07:53.660 --> 07:56.060
through that gigabit connection.

07:56.060 --> 07:59.780
Satellites can only communicate with the ground stations while they have a line of sight with

07:59.780 --> 08:05.220
the antenna so, due to the curvature of the earth, in the view of any given ground station,

08:05.220 --> 08:07.980
the satellite will eventually dip below the horizon.

08:07.980 --> 08:12.600
Therefore, each ground station only has a limited operating range.

08:12.600 --> 08:16.620
The exact locations of ground stations are, understandably, kept secret, but if there

08:16.620 --> 08:20.600
was one in Germany, for example, it would communicate with the digital globe satellites

08:20.600 --> 08:23.540
exclusively while they passed over Europe.

08:23.540 --> 08:28.300
The fact that these satellites have to, by nature, pass over the entire world is actually,

08:28.300 --> 08:30.140
however, quite useful.

08:30.140 --> 08:34.820
Not only does this let digital globe map the entire world, but they also use the extra

08:34.820 --> 08:37.340
capacity for humanitarian efforts.

08:37.340 --> 08:42.420
It's actually easier for us on the humanitarian global development side because we have much

08:42.420 --> 08:45.300
more capacity over a lot of these areas.

08:45.300 --> 08:50.740
There's a lot more demand for our satellites over developed countries, for instance, right?

08:50.740 --> 08:56.060
So people are typically, for commercial applications, much more interested in the U.S. or Europe

08:56.060 --> 09:01.500
or some of these more developed areas versus sub-Saharan Africa where we, just generally

09:01.500 --> 09:06.460
speaking, have much more ability to task the constellation and to collect those imagery.

09:06.460 --> 09:11.980
So it's actually an opportunity for us to support those use cases much more than others.

09:11.980 --> 09:16.080
For instance, Digital Globe partners with the Gates Foundation to map every single building

09:16.080 --> 09:21.220
structure in rural Zambia so aid workers now know things like how many bed nets, vaccines,

09:21.220 --> 09:24.860
or food to bring to communities that were previously unmapped.

09:24.860 --> 09:30.780
There are few companies the size of commercial space companies that rely on so few assets.

09:30.780 --> 09:35.980
What makes Digital Globe, for example, run are those five satellites and to get those

09:35.980 --> 09:40.640
to space, to the place where they make money, they had to put them on rockets which tend

09:40.640 --> 09:43.120
to, from time to time, blow up.

09:43.120 --> 09:46.640
It's always a little bit of a nail biter as you come up to a launch.

09:46.640 --> 09:51.880
We put an enormous capital investment into the satellites and the launch vehicle and

09:51.880 --> 09:56.320
it all comes down to a one hour event—lifting off from the ground and going into orbit and

09:56.320 --> 10:00.040
that's a, that can be a little bit of a nerve-wracking period but certainly very exciting

10:00.040 --> 10:01.600
at the same time.

10:01.600 --> 10:07.240
An average of one in twenty rocket launches fail and then, on top of that, some satellites

10:07.240 --> 10:11.360
fail once they reach orbit which makes the space business risky.

10:11.360 --> 10:15.680
Companies like Digital Globe will therefore purchase enormously expensive insurance policies

10:15.680 --> 10:19.960
on their satellites in case the launch or the satellite itself fails.

10:19.960 --> 10:24.280
If they didn't, one bad launch could spell the end for the company.

10:24.280 --> 10:28.280
Of course, some launch providers are much more reliable than others.

10:28.280 --> 10:31.840
United Launch Alliance, the launch provider that Digital Globe used for their current

10:31.840 --> 10:36.560
five satellites, has not had a launch failure in its eleven year history.

10:36.560 --> 10:40.880
Insurance rates for ULA would be relatively low while insurance rates for a newer launch

10:40.880 --> 10:45.160
provider, such as Orbital ATK or Blue Origin, would be comparatively high.

10:45.160 --> 10:50.160
Nonetheless, the cost of newer launch providers with insurance included is now often less

10:50.160 --> 10:52.800
than the older, more reliable launch companies.

10:52.800 --> 10:55.500
But how does Digital Globe fund their exploits?

10:55.500 --> 10:57.580
What keeps those satellites flying?

10:57.580 --> 10:59.560
How do they make their money?

10:59.560 --> 11:02.800
Our largest customer is the US government and we've been very proud to be their mission

11:02.800 --> 11:06.760
partner for over a decade and a half coming up on two decades now.

11:06.760 --> 11:12.360
It used to be that the commercial satellite industry was essentially focused on one major

11:12.360 --> 11:14.180
customer—governments.

11:14.180 --> 11:19.060
In the past, the US government has been the single largest customer of the few commercial

11:19.060 --> 11:23.440
space companies that there were thanks to its enormous defense spending, but today as

11:23.440 --> 11:29.060
commercial customers contract commercial space companies, the business is spreading globally.

11:29.060 --> 11:34.820
Over the past decade, the customer base has become more international and more diversified.

11:34.820 --> 11:41.240
Our other customers are international customers who may be US allies or maybe technology companies

11:41.240 --> 11:42.700
across the world.

11:42.700 --> 11:48.220
We go deep in the telecommunications infrastructure, online mapping, energy industries, mining

11:48.220 --> 11:50.380
industries, forestry applications.

11:50.380 --> 11:55.500
There's really a huge variety of customers, but the most obvious ones are those mapping

11:55.500 --> 11:56.500
companies.

11:56.500 --> 11:59.400
If you've ever used Google maps, you're using our imagery.

11:59.400 --> 12:02.860
If you've ever used Apple maps, you're using our imagery.

12:02.860 --> 12:07.620
If you ever look and do a crowdsourcing project in OpenStreetMap, you're using our imagery

12:07.620 --> 12:08.780
as well.

12:08.780 --> 12:14.340
But perhaps the single most promising use of earth imagery is with autonomous vehicles.

12:14.340 --> 12:20.140
Having good, solid, current satellite imagery is an integral part of how autonomous vehicles

12:20.140 --> 12:21.140
work.

12:21.140 --> 12:25.940
These vehicles can't just rely on their internal sensors to understand their surroundings—they

12:25.940 --> 12:28.040
get a view from above.

12:28.040 --> 12:34.100
As we think about autonomous vehicles, it's not okay to update the image once a quarter,

12:34.100 --> 12:37.900
once a year, even once a week.

12:37.900 --> 12:42.540
They really need imagery that's coming in much, much faster than that to deal with changes

12:42.540 --> 12:46.980
in traffic conditions, changes in roads, crashes, etc.

12:46.980 --> 12:51.360
Uber, which is developing autonomous cars, is already a customer of Digital Globe for

12:51.360 --> 12:55.720
navigation purposes and as more and more companies move into the autonomous vehicle

12:55.720 --> 13:00.240
race, the competition between earth observation companies for their business is likely to

13:00.240 --> 13:01.240
heat up.

13:01.240 --> 13:05.840
There are plenty of other emerging uses as well which, as an ensemble, are growing the

13:05.840 --> 13:08.360
demand for earth imagery day by day.

13:08.360 --> 13:12.160
It is a tremendously fast growing industry.

13:12.160 --> 13:15.560
But satellite imagery by itself really isn't worth much.

13:15.560 --> 13:17.120
You need something more.

13:17.120 --> 13:24.000
I would say that our customers are demanding more actionable information faster than ever.

13:24.000 --> 13:26.560
Translation—customers want data.

13:26.560 --> 13:30.400
They want the information embedded in the images.

13:30.400 --> 13:33.560
For that, there's another company—Radiant Solutions.

13:33.560 --> 13:39.800
So today customers, the big challenge is around where it used to be more of a, hey we just

13:39.800 --> 13:45.080
need to get an answer, now it's more of how do we deal with all of this data and how

13:45.080 --> 13:49.200
do we answer the more complex questions because they are getting more complex and they're

13:49.200 --> 13:53.560
getting even harder to answer now by virtue of being inundated with data.

13:53.560 --> 13:57.920
Radiant Solutions would describe themselves as a geospatial analytics company.

13:57.920 --> 14:01.200
They take satellite imagery and translate it into information.

14:01.200 --> 14:06.440
We're able to take in vast amounts of data and make sense of it to produce insight.

14:06.440 --> 14:08.200
They answer big questions.

14:08.200 --> 14:12.720
A logging company might ask a question like, what's the density of trees in this particular

14:12.720 --> 14:17.880
region of Canada before purchasing new land and Radiant would be able to look at hundreds

14:17.880 --> 14:22.540
or thousands or millions of square miles of imagery to tell them how many trees there

14:22.540 --> 14:23.540
are.

14:23.540 --> 14:28.920
Now, with so much imagery and such a big world, you can't just do this all by hand—at

14:28.920 --> 14:30.400
least economically.

14:30.400 --> 14:34.640
For that reason, there's been a huge shift in the geospatial analytics business toward

14:34.640 --> 14:36.920
using artificial intelligence.

14:36.920 --> 14:40.200
We hear more and more now that data is kind of like the new oil.

14:40.200 --> 14:45.000
Well that's sort of true but the data has to be reliable, there has to be high confidence

14:45.000 --> 14:46.000
in the data.

14:46.000 --> 14:48.000
So the AI has to be good.

14:48.000 --> 14:52.240
To train a machine to find a red car, for example, you need to show it thousands or

14:52.240 --> 14:56.400
millions of examples of what a red car looks like, but…

14:56.400 --> 15:00.280
It's very different for a machine to look for a red car in an urban environment as it

15:00.280 --> 15:02.380
is to find a red car in snow.

15:02.380 --> 15:07.520
So not only are you training the models to look for that object, but you also have to

15:07.520 --> 15:09.960
train it on where to find it regionally.

15:09.960 --> 15:16.360
It is hugely complicated, but that's why these guys are in business—to answer complicated

15:16.360 --> 15:17.500
questions.

15:17.500 --> 15:20.840
Some data, however, isn't in the visual spectrum.

15:20.840 --> 15:25.840
Some data is hidden, but luckily there's a special satellite just for that.

15:25.840 --> 15:30.400
In the old days, it was just please get me good, solid image pixels to use and I'll

15:30.400 --> 15:32.280
go figure out how to use them.

15:32.280 --> 15:37.500
Today, particularly in the commercial space, it's all about information.

15:37.500 --> 15:40.900
That's Paul Kennedy—Vice President of Ground Systems at MDA.

15:40.900 --> 15:44.500
They've been in business since 1969.

15:44.500 --> 15:48.860
Their most visible project was on developing the Canadarm for the space shuttles and International

15:48.860 --> 15:49.980
Space Station.

15:49.980 --> 15:54.380
As a long-time player in the industry, they serve a variety of functions from developing

15:54.380 --> 15:59.480
space robotics to building satellite ground stations, but one of their most valuable assets

15:59.480 --> 16:02.820
is that special satellite—Radarsat-2.

16:02.820 --> 16:07.380
While most earth observation satellites image using the visual spectrum, what we can see

16:07.380 --> 16:11.260
with our own eyes, Radarsat-2 uses radar.

16:11.260 --> 16:13.600
Radar is an active pulse.

16:13.600 --> 16:22.300
So the satellite actually sends a beam of energy to the ground and reads back what it

16:22.300 --> 16:29.800
gets back from the earth and that gives us a couple of interesting advantages in SAR.

16:29.800 --> 16:33.300
For one, radar can see through clouds and darkness.

16:33.300 --> 16:38.140
It doesn't matter what the light and weather conditions are, it's all the same for Radarsat-2.

16:38.140 --> 16:44.240
Now, MDA is a Canadian company and it's no coincidence that a Canadian company operates

16:44.240 --> 16:45.540
this satellite.

16:45.540 --> 16:50.100
Just like the US government is a major customer of Digital Globe, the Canadian government

16:50.100 --> 16:55.540
is a major customer of MDA and here's the thing about Canada—the weather is terrible

16:55.540 --> 16:57.060
and it's always dark.

16:57.060 --> 17:01.660
Quite literally in northern Canada where the sun stays down for the entire winter.

17:01.660 --> 17:05.940
It's no coincidence that the company that works so closely with the Canadian government

17:05.940 --> 17:09.540
operates the satellite that can see through clouds and night.

17:09.540 --> 17:13.980
Without Radarsat-2, the Canadian government would be blind—they would have no way of

17:13.980 --> 17:19.460
monitoring huge swaths of their territory in the high arctic for months out of the year.

17:19.460 --> 17:24.140
With new launch providers emerging such as Blue Origin and Rocket Lab and SpaceX, the

17:24.140 --> 17:27.540
cost of launching material into space is plummeting.

17:27.540 --> 17:32.220
Now, this is useful to these companies, at least in some ways.

17:32.220 --> 17:36.660
With lower launch costs, Digital Globe and MDA can launch more satellites which means

17:36.660 --> 17:41.980
more data for radiant solutions, but that also makes it easier for competitors to launch

17:41.980 --> 17:42.980
satellites.

17:42.980 --> 17:47.080
The earth imagery business is growing but so is the competition.

17:47.080 --> 17:52.820
The best known earth imagery startup, Planet, is launching a constellation of small satellites.

17:52.820 --> 17:57.060
While Digital Globe's satellites are the size of a bus, Planet's smallest are the

17:57.060 --> 17:59.100
size of a toaster.

17:59.100 --> 18:02.780
With the smaller size, development and launch costs are lower.

18:02.780 --> 18:07.400
While in the past starting a space imagery company required hundreds of millions or billions

18:07.400 --> 18:12.960
of dollars in funding, the emergence of smallsats means that it's enormously easier to break

18:12.960 --> 18:15.840
into the satellite imagery business nowadays.

18:15.840 --> 18:19.600
But there is a key difference between these two companies.

18:19.600 --> 18:24.600
Digital Globe's satellites capture imagery with a pixel size of 12 inches while Planet's

18:24.600 --> 18:30.060
primary satellite constellation captures imagery with a pixel size of 10-15 feet at a much

18:30.060 --> 18:31.340
lower cost.

18:31.340 --> 18:35.560
There are certain uses for high-resolution imagery and there are certain other uses for

18:35.560 --> 18:41.120
low-cost imagery so in some ways, these two companies aren't even direct competitors.

18:41.120 --> 18:46.360
Nonetheless, the space industry is changing, growing, and becoming more competitive so

18:46.360 --> 18:49.140
the established companies need to adapt.

18:49.140 --> 18:54.180
United Launch Alliance knows that, Airbus knows that, Arianespace knows that, and Digital

18:54.180 --> 18:58.860
Globe, MDA, and Radiant know that too, so they made a change.

18:58.860 --> 19:01.060
These three companies are now one.

19:01.060 --> 19:04.980
Along with a fourth company, a spacecraft manufacturing company called SSL that will

19:04.980 --> 19:10.140
be covered in a future video, these are the entities that make up the newest powerhouse

19:10.140 --> 19:12.500
in the space technology business.

19:12.500 --> 19:16.900
This merger wasn't necessarily in response to heavy competition but rather, at least

19:16.900 --> 19:22.000
from an outsider's perspective, a preemptive strike to establish themselves as a major

19:22.000 --> 19:26.940
international player before the commercial space industry truly lifts off.

19:26.940 --> 19:33.140
Increasingly, the more traditional aerospace and defense companies that have been supplying

19:33.140 --> 19:41.140
technology in space have been able to provide the performance but the cost has been extremely

19:41.140 --> 19:42.140
high.

19:42.140 --> 19:45.660
Maxar is now a fully vertically integrated company.

19:45.660 --> 19:49.760
In the earth imagery space, for example, they'll do everything from building satellites to

19:49.760 --> 19:52.680
operating them to extracting data from imagery.

19:52.680 --> 19:57.260
By performing all the steps in this process internally, Maxar lowers its costs and this

19:57.260 --> 20:02.500
also puts them in the same league as Airbus as one of the very few end-to-end integrated

20:02.500 --> 20:04.380
space companies.

20:04.380 --> 20:09.460
The commercial space industry as a whole is doing a phenomenal job of making access to

20:09.460 --> 20:11.760
orbital space commonplace.

20:12.280 --> 20:21.060
The routine steps of space activities are slowly being ceded to private enterprise that

20:21.060 --> 20:22.640
could do it faster, better, cheaper.

20:22.640 --> 20:27.120
We're now at a place where launching a satellite to low earth orbit is unexceptional.

20:27.120 --> 20:32.640
That's exactly what we want—easy access to space—and for near space, that exists

20:32.640 --> 20:33.960
right now.

20:33.960 --> 20:39.480
Getting beyond earth's orbit, though, outside our cosmic neighborhood, into deep space,

20:39.480 --> 20:41.260
that's still tough.

20:41.260 --> 20:46.740
The problem is that private enterprise, by its very nature, needs to make money.

20:46.740 --> 20:50.260
Companies and their leaders are beholden to their investors to make money.

20:50.260 --> 20:52.900
If they're not, then they're not a company.

20:52.900 --> 20:57.260
Companies can and do make money with deep space but only through developing and building

20:57.260 --> 21:00.780
technologies for NASA and other government agencies.

21:00.780 --> 21:05.460
There is zero commercial demand for deep space technology today.

21:05.460 --> 21:11.620
Going to new planets, to new solar systems, exploring space, that really doesn't make

21:11.620 --> 21:12.980
money.

21:12.980 --> 21:17.440
Many people who think about commercial space, I think they're over-predicting what their

21:17.440 --> 21:18.440
role will be.

21:18.440 --> 21:22.060
They're imagining commercial space leading a space frontier.

21:22.060 --> 21:28.120
But to lead a space frontier is expensive and it's not an obvious return on the investment.

21:28.120 --> 21:29.580
You might do it as a vanity project.

21:29.580 --> 21:33.300
If there are enough billionaires in the world, they could all pool their money.

21:33.300 --> 21:38.300
Jeff Bezos, Bill Gates, Elon Musk.

21:38.300 --> 21:42.100
They could do a vanity project and send humans to Mars, let's say.

21:42.100 --> 21:47.220
But that's not a business model and it would get a lot of attention but is that something

21:47.220 --> 21:48.220
you can sustain?

21:48.220 --> 21:49.220
No.

21:49.220 --> 21:51.100
It would be a one-off.

21:51.100 --> 21:56.560
When people imagine a future of space and industry, they're imagining a sustained

21:56.560 --> 21:58.060
business case.

21:58.060 --> 22:02.600
Of course, you could have said the same thing about the space race 60 years ago.

22:02.600 --> 22:08.220
That was exploration, however, in the long term, it was an investment that paid off because

22:08.220 --> 22:11.600
space now makes money.

22:11.600 --> 22:17.000
Space today is an integral part of what we know and what we can do on the surface of

22:17.000 --> 22:19.000
the planet.

22:19.000 --> 22:27.920
Communications, imagery, climate science, defense and intelligence and security applications,

22:27.920 --> 22:34.880
all of those are seamlessly enabled by space technologies without most of us who go through

22:34.880 --> 22:38.800
our daily lives not even thinking about it.

22:38.800 --> 22:43.160
The difference between commercial enterprise and governments is time.

22:43.160 --> 22:47.520
Commercial enterprises need to think about investments that pay off within the lifetime

22:47.520 --> 22:48.520
of their shareholders.

22:48.520 --> 22:53.880
So you're always thinking about what is the return on the investment you're making?

22:53.880 --> 22:58.560
How long will it take you to achieve the returns on the investment?

22:58.560 --> 23:04.200
And what's the probability that the R&D you're putting in will be successful?

23:04.200 --> 23:08.600
While companies look at investments in terms of years, governments can look at investments

23:08.600 --> 23:14.260
in terms of decades or centuries because governments transcend generations.

23:14.260 --> 23:18.640
The innovation that will occur by bringing humans to Mars and beyond will absolutely

23:18.640 --> 23:20.640
make money in the very long term.

23:20.640 --> 23:26.300
But right now, it would take an enormous amount of money that few people want to risk.

23:26.300 --> 23:30.760
You could point to Elon Musk as an exception to this rule—he more than anyone understands

23:30.760 --> 23:35.920
the value of super long-term investments like going to Mars—but he also understands that

23:35.920 --> 23:37.760
he's alone in that.

23:37.760 --> 23:42.160
Individuals don't want to invest in something that won't make money until after they're

23:42.160 --> 23:43.160
dead.

23:43.160 --> 23:48.120
Musk has stated that he has no plans to take SpaceX public until after a successful mission

23:48.120 --> 23:53.960
to Mars which means that, for the moment, the company is almost acting more as an organization.

23:53.960 --> 23:58.920
He's funneling the money from launches, which make money, into exploration, which

23:58.920 --> 23:59.920
doesn't.

23:59.920 --> 24:05.280
Governments need to lead the way because they have the longer time horizons that they can

24:05.280 --> 24:08.600
think about and monetize.

24:08.600 --> 24:14.740
When they do that, once they lead the way they have now quantified the risks and you

24:14.740 --> 24:20.280
know the costs and where the friendlies are and the hostels and whatever are the things

24:20.280 --> 24:24.900
that would compromise your mission, they've already figured this out.

24:24.900 --> 24:28.700
Then if they do it right, you then hand that to private industry that then makes a buck

24:28.700 --> 24:32.540
off of it, then the government can tax that if they so choose.

24:32.540 --> 24:37.480
Maxar Technologies and its four businesses meanwhile absolutely innovate including in

24:37.480 --> 24:41.900
deep space technologies, but they're not going to put the pieces together to go to

24:41.900 --> 24:46.320
Mars by themselves because that's not a good investment.

24:46.320 --> 24:50.760
One should be careful to realize that this coming era of commercialized space does not

24:50.760 --> 24:54.940
necessarily translate into a renaissance of space exploration.

24:54.940 --> 25:01.140
Commercial industry is not a substitute for NASA or the ESA or any other government institution.

25:01.140 --> 25:02.660
They are collaborators.

25:02.660 --> 25:07.180
They can make the government's job easier and cheaper, but they cannot replace those

25:07.180 --> 25:10.760
whose jobs are to go where no human has gone before.

25:10.760 --> 25:17.000
The next few decades and centuries can be the era of space exploration but for that,

25:17.000 --> 25:21.900
you need a public, you need an electorate that understands that anything good, anything

25:21.900 --> 25:27.120
truly worthwhile, takes time.

25:27.120 --> 25:32.080
There are so many thanks I have to give for help with this video but one is to Away, not

25:32.080 --> 25:36.400
only for making this video possible through sponsorship, but also for literally carrying

25:36.400 --> 25:42.000
my possessions over the 15,000 miles I traveled while making this video, and unfortunately

25:42.000 --> 25:43.280
that number is not a mistake.

25:43.280 --> 25:47.980
I've now owned my Away suitcase for almost a year, have traveled all over the world with

25:47.980 --> 25:49.640
it, and I love it.

25:49.640 --> 25:54.480
The suitcase is just solidly built, you can feel it, and it has a built-in yet removable

25:54.480 --> 25:59.440
battery, a laundry bag, a laptop sleeve, and a compression system so you can pack more

25:59.440 --> 26:01.340
into a smaller space.

26:01.340 --> 26:06.040
Best of all, for how good it is, the Away suitcase is sold for an amazing price and

26:06.040 --> 26:11.260
it's at an even more amazing price if you go to awaytravel.com slash wendover and use

26:11.260 --> 26:15.600
the code wendover at checkout to get $20 off your Away suitcase.

26:15.600 --> 26:19.880
They're so confident that you'll love the product that all Away suitcases have a

26:19.880 --> 26:23.920
lifetime warranty and a 100-day unconditional return policy.

26:23.920 --> 26:29.160
It's quite literally no risk and they made this enormous video possible so if you need

26:29.160 --> 26:34.760
a suitcase for life, check out awaytravel.com slash wendover and use the code wendover at

26:34.760 --> 26:35.760
checkout.

26:35.760 --> 26:40.440
I also have to give a huge thanks to Maxar Technologies, especially Kristen Karringer

26:40.440 --> 26:45.440
and Turner Brinton, for letting me film this video as it takes an enormous amount of work

26:45.440 --> 26:48.800
to allow cameras into such a high-security environment.

26:48.800 --> 26:52.800
Lastly, as I mentioned at the beginning, I appeared on Neil deGrasse Tyson's show Star

26:52.800 --> 26:57.360
Talk and also launched a new personal channel where I made a behind-the-scenes video for

26:57.360 --> 26:58.360
that appearance.

26:58.360 --> 27:01.660
Both are linked in the description and on screen now.

27:01.660 --> 27:05.280
Thanks again for watching and I'll see you again in three weeks for another Wendover

27:05.280 --> 27:06.460
Productions video.
