10400	16520	On August 15th, 2021, Taliban fighters encircled Kabul.
16520	21960	Over the hours, days, and weeks prior, they had swept across the nation, toppling provincial
21960	24520	capital after provincial capital.
24720	31240	Now, their grand prize—their return to rule after 20 years of war with the West—was
31240	32740	within sight.
32740	37280	As police put on street clothes, retailers raised the price of burkas, and workers painted
37280	43240	over pictures of women, Hamid Karzai International Airport maintained an eerie impression of
43240	44240	normalcy.
44240	48640	It was certainly busy, with civilians fleeing on commercial flights, governments evacuating
48640	53400	their diplomatic staff, and airlines relocating their aircraft to more stable nations, but
53400	59100	the way Kabul's airport operated that morning was broadly the way it operated any morning.
59100	65200	At 1042 AM, a Pakistan International Airlines 777-200 landed from Islamabad.
65200	71840	At 1126, a Qatar Airways 777-300ER touched down on a charter flight from Doha.
71840	79060	Shortly after, at 1149, a Kam Air A340 left on its daily run to Delhi.
79060	83600	In spite of the foreboding feeling in the air, the airport fulfilled its regular role
83600	86460	for the bustling Middle Eastern metropolis.
86460	88140	But then came the news.
88140	94620	Shortly after noon, the Taliban's spokesperson, Zabuhullah Mujahid, issued a statement.
94620	99740	Their forces had encircled Kabul, and they intended to enter.
99740	105540	Still, the planes kept coming, having allocated each one of their seats to those lucky enough
105540	107620	to find an available ticket.
107620	113160	As an Air India A320 approached, however, ATC stopped responding.
113160	117780	With panic setting in on the ground, controllers had abandoned their posts, so in the air,
117780	122460	the A320 entered a holding pattern until its pilots determined a course of action.
122460	128140	12,000 feet above, an Emirates 777 did the same until it diverted back to Dubai, but
128140	132980	one hour later, finally, the Air India aircraft successfully landed.
132980	137780	In the hours that followed, without any ATC clearance, the Pakistan International Airlines
137780	144500	777, Qatar Airways 777, Air India A320, and a Pakistan International Airlines A320 each
144500	149420	departed for their destinations, but the most significant departure was not one of the afternoon's
149420	152620	planes, but a passenger aboard it.
152620	158760	At 456 PM, Tolo News, one of Afghanistan's largest broadcasters, reported that President
158760	162480	Ashraf Ghani had fled the country.
162480	166300	The Islamic Republic of Afghanistan was no longer.
166300	169960	The Taliban were in control.
169960	173360	Soon after, its forces entered Kabul.
173360	180600	At 738 PM, a Kam Air 737 left on the Afghan Airlines regular evening run to Islamabad,
180600	186480	representing Kabul's last regularly scheduled commercial flight for days, weeks, or maybe
186480	187480	more.
187480	191760	Meanwhile, the Taliban took control of the ark, Afghanistan's presidential palace,
192040	196520	and the first photos emerged displaying the finality of the situation.
196520	199560	Reactions around Kabul were mixed.
199560	200560	Some celebrated.
200560	206100	The jihadist group does have some public support, so Kabul's streets were roamed by men enjoying
206100	209480	what was, in their minds, a victorious night.
209480	214840	Others, including nearly all women, hid in their homes, worried for potential violence
214840	217360	and for the future of their country.
217800	224240	Then there were those who feared for their lives—journalists, activists, former government
224240	229360	officials, along with interpreters, security guards, and others who had worked with American,
229360	231880	NATO, and NATO Allied forces.
231880	237400	The desperation was undoubtedly profound because as soon as Kabul's fall was no longer in
237400	242680	question, scores of people worked their way through the streets towards the same destination—Kabul
242680	244160	Airport.
244160	248720	The Taliban already controlled every one of Afghanistan's land border crossings, so
248720	254120	the airport was truly the singular way out for those who needed to leave.
254120	258760	Surrounded by dense urban sprawl and located mere miles from the city center, Hamid Karzai
258760	263360	International Airport is a nightmare from a perimeter security perspective.
263360	267960	It was hardly difficult for those who flocked there to scale its walls, and across the evening
267960	273520	of August 15th, thousands made it onto the airfield, desperate to find any flight, with
273520	277760	any seat, going anywhere but Afghanistan.
277760	282280	In the days leading up to the fall of Kabul, the US had ramped up its evacuation efforts,
282280	287680	largely in the mission of evacuating its diplomatic staff before the situation deteriorated further.
287680	292960	Therefore, it had already deployed thousands of troops and effectively relocated its embassy,
292960	296200	and the key staff that ran it, to the airport.
296200	302200	Amidst the chaos, a single C-17 was scheduled to depart, filled with hundreds of individuals
302200	306320	adorned with a wristband, indicating that they had been authorized to travel on an American
306320	311280	evacuation flight, due to their status as an individual believed to be in acute danger
311280	313040	under Taliban rule.
313040	318900	The manifest for this flight, Reach 871, soon became moot, as hundreds who were not assigned
318900	323360	to the particular flight, but were cleared to fly, rushed the cargo bay.
323360	327580	The aircraft became packed far beyond its operating limit, but faced with the alternative
327580	331860	of spending hours reloading the aircraft properly as the airfield's condition decayed
331860	338620	further, Reach 871's commander chose to break protocol and take off at 1.27 am on
338620	340820	August 16th.
340820	346820	823 passengers were packed onto the aircraft's floor, easily breaking the record for the
346820	349760	most people carried by a C-17.
349760	355780	As the sun rose on the first day of the second era of Taliban rule in Afghanistan, a brief
355780	359900	lull from chaos, along with the official announcement that the US military had taken
359900	365280	over air traffic control at the airport, allowed a Turkish Airlines 777, a civilian aircraft
365280	369700	that just the day prior had flown a regular flight from San Francisco to Istanbul, to
369700	374020	land in order to pick up Turkish citizens still left in the country.
374020	378380	It parked on the military side of the airport, north of the runway, around which military
378380	381540	forces had established a security perimeter.
381540	387900	For the following hours, as the aircraft loaded, the situation deteriorated once again.
387900	393360	Satellite imagery taken at 1036 am displays the state of chaos.
393360	397860	The airport's southern gate was thoroughly breached, with individuals flowing freely
397860	398860	through.
398860	402900	Four military vehicles appeared to be working to contain crowds of people to the civilian
402900	404340	aircraft apron.
404340	407940	Others had already made it further, and were strewn across the runway.
408260	413480	A line of US military vehicles denoted their security perimeter, preventing anyone from
413480	417960	advancing further north into the military area of the airport from where evacuation
417960	419620	flights were leaving.
419620	423700	Two other vehicles flanked the crowd on each side to prevent the runway incursion from
423700	424700	widening.
424700	430180	Meanwhile, to the east, the Turkish Airlines 777 sat idle, filled with its evacuees, just
430180	433740	waiting for a clear runway, in order to take off.
433740	438100	Without much progress, it later taxied back to the apron as the military worked to clear
438100	439100	the runway.
439100	444700	They were successful enough that a US Air Force C-17 was able to land at 1230 pm, but
444700	448200	the aircraft was quickly swarmed by the same crowds.
448200	452980	As Apache helicopters flew low across the runway in an attempt to clear people away,
452980	458500	the C-17's pilots decided to depart immediately without dropping off their cargo or loading
458500	459860	evacuees.
459860	465580	Inexplicably, dozens of individuals clung to the aircraft as it taxied, and some, perhaps
465580	470940	unaware of the aircraft's intention to take off, did not let go.
470940	475060	Gruesome video soon emerged depicting two individuals falling hundreds of feet to their
475060	480000	death after takeoff, and human remains were later found in the aircraft's wheel well
480000	482740	upon its return to Qatar.
482740	488620	This included Fada Mohamed, a young dentist from the outskirts of Kabul, and Zaki Anwari,
488620	494220	a teenage soccer star who played center-back on the country's youth national team.
494220	497860	Perhaps the crowds were rattled by their deaths, perhaps the military took them as a sign to
497860	502620	intensify their efforts, or perhaps something entirely different occurred, but one way or
502620	508260	another, the runway was cleared and two US Air Force C-130 Hercules aircraft were able
508260	511180	to depart around 1250 pm.
511180	515240	The Turkish Airlines 777 left 25 minutes after that.
515240	519560	The rest of the afternoon of August 16th was more of the same—planes would land
519560	524140	and take off for a period, the situation would intensify, flights would halt, and then start
524140	527120	again once the chaos settled down.
527120	532160	White House evacuation numbers suggest that the record-breaking early morning C-17 flight
532160	537440	was likely the only departure to include civilian evacuees on August 16th, as little success
537440	542400	was had in the afternoon, with the airfield in such a state of anarchy.
542400	548920	Meanwhile, 7,000 miles or 11,000 kilometers away, Joe Biden was on board Marine One, making
548920	554180	the brief, 40-minute flight from Camp David, the presidential country retreat, to the White
554180	555300	House.
555300	560780	The fact that the president was on vacation was indicative of the situation—his administration
560780	564320	never expected the Taliban to conquer Kabul so quickly.
564320	570180	The criticism for the bungling of the withdrawal was resounding—just 26% of Americans surveyed
570180	574460	supported the president's handling of the situation, and his overall approval rating
574460	576540	took a nosedive.
576540	581660	By the evening of August 16th, Kabul had fallen, the airport was in a state of chaos, and there
581660	585860	was little the Biden administration could do to remedy the situation.
585860	590300	Upon landing at the White House, the president walked into the East Room, and as dozens of
590300	596500	cameras stared him down, he made his first public statement since the fall of Kabul.
596500	600860	After a defiant rebuttal of criticism over the withdrawal decision and sober condolences
600860	606140	to those affected by the situation, the topic shifted towards the ongoing evacuation effort,
606140	607940	with Biden saying, quote,
607940	612800	Our current military mission will be short in time, limited in scope, and focused in
612800	614180	its objectives.
614180	618780	Get our people and our allies to safety as quickly as possible.
618780	624200	The evacuation was all that was left of the 20-year war in Afghanistan, so it was the
624200	629840	last mission that could sway public opinion over the White House's handling of the situation.
629840	634960	Therefore, the combined efforts of dozens of government agencies were all concentrated
634960	641880	on getting as many endangered people as possible out of Afghanistan as soon as possible.
641880	647760	By the end of the week of August 15th, after days of steady but slower progress, the pieces
647760	653000	had been put in place to initiate a dramatic ramp-up in evacuations.
653000	657680	For any individual eligible to take an American flight, typically through status as an American
657680	662720	citizen, resident, or special immigrant visa holder or applicant, the first step was to
662720	665400	actually get to the airport.
665400	668160	This was no small feat.
668160	672760	The Taliban had set up two checkpoints on Airport Road, the main route to the airport,
672760	677360	purportedly to control the flow of people and prevent further chaos.
677360	682040	While official Taliban policy was to allow anyone authorized for evacuation by the US
682040	686560	or other nations through, there was often disconnect between policy and practice with
686560	691720	the group, so whether someone safely and successfully made it to the airport was largely up to the
691720	696400	discretion of the individual Taliban fighters operating such checkpoints.
696400	700560	The main civilian entrance to the airport was under Taliban control, so evacuees were
700560	705220	typically instructed to make their way to the Abbey, East, or North Gates.
705220	710160	From there, if they could work their way through the crowds and chaos, their eligibility for
710160	714200	evacuation would be checked, and a member of the military would pat them down to check
714200	717220	for weapons before letting them through.
717220	720840	Evacuees would then make their way to the apron on the military side of the airport,
720840	725320	where they'd load onto, typically, a C-17 or C-130.
725320	730080	To maximize capacity, floor-loading procedures were used, where cargo straps were laid across
730080	735080	the floor for passengers to hold onto during takeoff, landing, and turbulence.
735080	739600	This way, the passenger density was far higher than if using seats.
739600	744440	With the cargo bay doors closed on each flight, hundreds of evacuees glimpsed out at what
744440	750000	would almost certainly be their final view of the country they called home.
750000	755300	From there, American evacuation flights typically flew southwest for three hours, landing at
755300	757800	Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar.
757800	762280	This is the largest US military installation in the Middle East, and in many ways acts
762280	765000	as its headquarters of operations in the region.
765000	769840	For this mission, the base served as an interim stopover point as the evacuees awaited an
769840	773760	initial round of security screening before onward travel.
773760	777040	Conditions were undoubtedly rough.
777040	781760	The military used cavernous aircraft hangars and temporary cots to house the evacuees,
781760	786200	but with limited climate control, engineers struggled to find solutions to keep the space
786200	789720	cool in the intense heat of the Qatari desert.
789720	794780	Al Udeid Air Base quickly became a bottleneck, and on August 20th, flights out of Kabul were
794780	798660	halted for a few hours as the facility reached capacity.
798660	803180	The global US military logistics system kicked into gear, though, as portable air-conditioned
803180	807820	tents and toilets were flown in to increase capacity and improve conditions.
807820	813060	The main focus, however, was to get evacuees out of Qatar as fast as possible, move them
813060	816660	towards their destination, and make room for more.
816660	822380	To enable this, the President activated the rarely-used Civil Reserve Air Fleet.
822380	827180	Essentially, in order to compete for regular peacetime contracts to transport US military
827180	832340	members and supplies around the world, airlines in the US sign up as part of this reserve
832340	836760	air fleet, which can be activated when an emergency dictates that a need for aircraft
836760	842060	capacity exceeds the practical capacity of US military aircraft.
842060	844500	This was such an instance.
844500	850700	Therefore, 18 aircraft from American Airlines, Atlas Air, United Airlines, Delta Air Lines,
850700	854920	20 Air International, Hawaiian Airlines, and United Airlines were called into service
854920	857020	to assist with evacuations.
857020	864460	For example, this United Airlines 777-300, tail number N2352U, landed at Al Udeid at
864460	867480	1019 PM on August 22nd.
867480	872700	It spent four hours on the ground, then ferried a full load of evacuees six hours west to
872700	875540	Ramstein Air Base in Germany.
875540	881020	Ramstein, similar to Al Udeid, is the largest American base in Europe and effectively operates
881020	887220	at the scale of a small city with up to 50,000 Americans living in and around the base.
887220	891820	One of its major roles is to provide logistics capabilities, meaning it quite often serves
891820	896540	as a stopping point for military aircraft traveling between the US and the Middle East.
896540	902180	Therefore, it had the perfect position and scale to relieve stress from Al Udeid.
902180	906900	In the more hospitable German climate, there was no longer the issue of inhumane heat,
906900	912220	so the military set up a sprawling complex of tents and cots.
912220	917020	Evacuated kids were even able to set up a daily soccer match on a patch of grass.
917020	922260	Civilian volunteers helped distribute mountains of donated clothes, sanitary products, toys,
922260	927260	and more to the evacuees, who had to leave almost all their possessions behind—only
927260	929960	permitted to take a single bag.
929960	935160	After further security screening and immigration processing, evacuees were ready to finally
935160	937200	head to the United States.
937200	942480	The same aforementioned United Airlines 777 loaded up to fly this leg for the first time
942480	947320	on August 23rd, and then made the seven and a half hour flight west to Dulles Airport
947320	949780	just outside Washington, DC.
949780	954700	Upon landing, evacuees were tested for COVID, processed through immigration, and finally
954700	958420	took their first steps into the United States.
958420	960780	From there, though, it was more of the same.
960780	965160	They were bussed to the nearby Dulles Expo Center, which acted as temporary housing as
965160	967000	they awaited further travel.
967000	972220	In the hours or days waiting there, each evacuee was offered a COVID vaccine and additional
972220	974020	donated items.
974020	978780	Some were bussed to nearby McGuire Air Force Base, Fort Lee, Marine Corps Base Quantico,
978780	983860	or Fort Pickett, while others boarded further flights to Fort McCoy in Wisconsin, Fort Bliss
983860	987780	in Texas, or Holloman Air Force Base in New Mexico.
987780	992320	These bases served as slightly longer-term housing for the evacuees, as they awaited
992320	996940	a final round of immigration processing, before being connected with a refugee resettlement
996940	1003460	organization to assist them in setting up their new lives somewhere in the United States.
1003460	1008220	This entire evacuation process happened at a breakneck pace.
1008220	1014140	Kabul to Al Udeid, Al Udeid to Ramstein, and Ramstein to Dulles likely became the busiest
1014140	1019140	three international flight routes in the world for a few days, even as other bases
1019140	1023820	in Kuwait, Italy, Spain, and elsewhere were brought online as interim stopping points
1023820	1027580	to relieve pressure on this main evacuation route as well.
1027580	1034180	The system was able to ramp up to a peak of 13,000 evacuations a day on US military aircraft,
1034180	1040360	as well as an additional 9,000 on civilian and allied military aircraft on August 24th.
1040360	1044560	The system was also, however, imperfect.
1044560	1050200	One crucial weakness was that the US military's role in administering Kabul Airport required
1050200	1055480	at least some direct interface between service members and the general public.
1055480	1060680	Specifically, that occurred here, at AbiGate, where troops checked individuals' eligibility
1060680	1064000	to enter and searched them for weapons.
1064000	1068120	This was necessary to ensure the safety of the flights.
1068120	1072520	In theory, most people at this location would have already passed through Taliban security
1072520	1076960	checkpoints, but these were irregular and imperfect.
1076960	1084240	Consequently, taking advantage of the densely packed chaos, on August 26th, at 5.50 pm,
1084240	1089560	a suicide bomber from ISIS-K detonated their explosive vest and a gunman from the terrorist
1089560	1092560	group then fired into the crowd.
1092560	1099160	169 civilians and 13 American service members were killed.
1099160	1104160	By the 26th, the bulk of the evacuation was already completed, and so the suicide bombing
1104160	1107300	had little effect on the success of the mission.
1107300	1112440	One by one, over the coming days, American allied nations announced the last of their
1112440	1116720	evacuation flights, and the end of their presence in Afghanistan.
1116720	1122240	Australia, France, New Zealand, Italy, and more finished on the 27th.
1122240	1127040	The UK, the second most involved nation in the evacuations, finished its effort on the
1127040	1131400	28th, with all of its troops out of the country by the following day.
1131400	1137880	Then, on August 30th, a few minutes before midnight, Ross Wilson, acting US ambassador
1137880	1144360	to Afghanistan, boarded a C-17 followed by Chris Donahue, commanding general of the 82nd
1144360	1145780	Airborne Division.
1145820	1152380	Behind him, the cargo bay door closed, the aircraft taxied, rolled down the runway, took
1152380	1156380	off, and banked towards the south.
1156380	1164420	With that moment, for the first time in 19 years, ten months, three weeks, and two days,
1164420	1175380	the US military had no presence in Afghanistan, and the war was finally and officially over.
1175380	1180480	Then once each of these tens of thousands of evacuees are safely in the US, the process
1180480	1182500	is far from over.
1182500	1187060	Right now, one of the largest and fastest resettlement efforts in history is kicking
1187060	1191780	into gear, and the logistics of helping such a mass of people set up new lives in such
1191780	1194880	a short amount of time are also fascinating.
1194880	1199540	As this video was already getting far too long, I made another video on that topic and
1199540	1201580	put it exclusively on Nebula.
1201580	1206700	I'm able to do that because Nebula was built by creators, including myself, from the ground
1206700	1210740	up to be able to enable us to make even better and more unique content.
1210740	1215220	That's why I've been able to make multiple big-budget Nebula originals, release my regular
1215220	1219760	videos there early and ad-free, and do these exclusive companion videos.
1219760	1223440	We also want new viewers to be able to watch our stuff on there, so we've partnered with
1223440	1227900	CuriosityStream to make it super easy to get access.

1249180	1253460	war that was the major contributing factor to the establishment of the Taliban.
