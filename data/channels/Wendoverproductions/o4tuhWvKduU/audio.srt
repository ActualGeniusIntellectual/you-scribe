4
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:16,520
On August 15th, 2021, Taliban fighters encircled Kabul.

5
00:00:16,520 --> 00:00:21,960
Over the hours, days, and weeks prior, they had swept across the nation, toppling provincial

6
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:24,520
capital after provincial capital.

7
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:31,240
Now, their grand prize—their return to rule after 20 years of war with the West—was

8
00:00:31,240 --> 00:00:32,740
within sight.

9
00:00:32,740 --> 00:00:37,280
As police put on street clothes, retailers raised the price of burkas, and workers painted

10
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:43,240
over pictures of women, Hamid Karzai International Airport maintained an eerie impression of

11
00:00:43,240 --> 00:00:44,240
normalcy.

12
00:00:44,240 --> 00:00:48,640
It was certainly busy, with civilians fleeing on commercial flights, governments evacuating

13
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:53,400
their diplomatic staff, and airlines relocating their aircraft to more stable nations, but

14
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:59,100
the way Kabul's airport operated that morning was broadly the way it operated any morning.

15
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:05,200
At 1042 AM, a Pakistan International Airlines 777-200 landed from Islamabad.

16
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:11,840
At 1126, a Qatar Airways 777-300ER touched down on a charter flight from Doha.

17
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:19,060
Shortly after, at 1149, a Kam Air A340 left on its daily run to Delhi.

18
00:01:19,060 --> 00:01:23,600
In spite of the foreboding feeling in the air, the airport fulfilled its regular role

19
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:26,460
for the bustling Middle Eastern metropolis.

20
00:01:26,460 --> 00:01:28,140
But then came the news.

21
00:01:28,140 --> 00:01:34,620
Shortly after noon, the Taliban's spokesperson, Zabuhullah Mujahid, issued a statement.

22
00:01:34,620 --> 00:01:39,740
Their forces had encircled Kabul, and they intended to enter.

23
00:01:39,740 --> 00:01:45,540
Still, the planes kept coming, having allocated each one of their seats to those lucky enough

24
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:47,620
to find an available ticket.

25
00:01:47,620 --> 00:01:53,160
As an Air India A320 approached, however, ATC stopped responding.

26
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:57,780
With panic setting in on the ground, controllers had abandoned their posts, so in the air,

27
00:01:57,780 --> 00:02:02,460
the A320 entered a holding pattern until its pilots determined a course of action.

28
00:02:02,460 --> 00:02:08,140
12,000 feet above, an Emirates 777 did the same until it diverted back to Dubai, but

29
00:02:08,140 --> 00:02:12,980
one hour later, finally, the Air India aircraft successfully landed.

30
00:02:12,980 --> 00:02:17,780
In the hours that followed, without any ATC clearance, the Pakistan International Airlines

31
00:02:17,780 --> 00:02:24,500
777, Qatar Airways 777, Air India A320, and a Pakistan International Airlines A320 each

32
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:29,420
departed for their destinations, but the most significant departure was not one of the afternoon's

33
00:02:29,420 --> 00:02:32,620
planes, but a passenger aboard it.

34
00:02:32,620 --> 00:02:38,760
At 456 PM, Tolo News, one of Afghanistan's largest broadcasters, reported that President

35
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:42,480
Ashraf Ghani had fled the country.

36
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:46,300
The Islamic Republic of Afghanistan was no longer.

37
00:02:46,300 --> 00:02:49,960
The Taliban were in control.

38
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:53,360
Soon after, its forces entered Kabul.

39
00:02:53,360 --> 00:03:00,600
At 738 PM, a Kam Air 737 left on the Afghan Airlines regular evening run to Islamabad,

40
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:06,480
representing Kabul's last regularly scheduled commercial flight for days, weeks, or maybe

41
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:07,480
more.

42
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:11,760
Meanwhile, the Taliban took control of the ark, Afghanistan's presidential palace,

43
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:16,520
and the first photos emerged displaying the finality of the situation.

44
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:19,560
Reactions around Kabul were mixed.

45
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:20,560
Some celebrated.

46
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:26,100
The jihadist group does have some public support, so Kabul's streets were roamed by men enjoying

47
00:03:26,100 --> 00:03:29,480
what was, in their minds, a victorious night.

48
00:03:29,480 --> 00:03:34,840
Others, including nearly all women, hid in their homes, worried for potential violence

49
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:37,360
and for the future of their country.

50
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:44,240
Then there were those who feared for their lives—journalists, activists, former government

51
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:49,360
officials, along with interpreters, security guards, and others who had worked with American,

52
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:51,880
NATO, and NATO Allied forces.

53
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:57,400
The desperation was undoubtedly profound because as soon as Kabul's fall was no longer in

54
00:03:57,400 --> 00:04:02,680
question, scores of people worked their way through the streets towards the same destination—Kabul

55
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:04,160
Airport.

56
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:08,720
The Taliban already controlled every one of Afghanistan's land border crossings, so

57
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:14,120
the airport was truly the singular way out for those who needed to leave.

58
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:18,760
Surrounded by dense urban sprawl and located mere miles from the city center, Hamid Karzai

59
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:23,360
International Airport is a nightmare from a perimeter security perspective.

60
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:27,960
It was hardly difficult for those who flocked there to scale its walls, and across the evening

61
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:33,520
of August 15th, thousands made it onto the airfield, desperate to find any flight, with

62
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:37,760
any seat, going anywhere but Afghanistan.

63
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:42,280
In the days leading up to the fall of Kabul, the US had ramped up its evacuation efforts,

64
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:47,680
largely in the mission of evacuating its diplomatic staff before the situation deteriorated further.

65
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:52,960
Therefore, it had already deployed thousands of troops and effectively relocated its embassy,

66
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:56,200
and the key staff that ran it, to the airport.

67
00:04:56,200 --> 00:05:02,200
Amidst the chaos, a single C-17 was scheduled to depart, filled with hundreds of individuals

68
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:06,320
adorned with a wristband, indicating that they had been authorized to travel on an American

69
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:11,280
evacuation flight, due to their status as an individual believed to be in acute danger

70
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:13,040
under Taliban rule.

71
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:18,900
The manifest for this flight, Reach 871, soon became moot, as hundreds who were not assigned

72
00:05:18,900 --> 00:05:23,360
to the particular flight, but were cleared to fly, rushed the cargo bay.

73
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:27,580
The aircraft became packed far beyond its operating limit, but faced with the alternative

74
00:05:27,580 --> 00:05:31,860
of spending hours reloading the aircraft properly as the airfield's condition decayed

75
00:05:31,860 --> 00:05:38,620
further, Reach 871's commander chose to break protocol and take off at 1.27 am on

76
00:05:38,620 --> 00:05:40,820
August 16th.

77
00:05:40,820 --> 00:05:46,820
823 passengers were packed onto the aircraft's floor, easily breaking the record for the

78
00:05:46,820 --> 00:05:49,760
most people carried by a C-17.

79
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:55,780
As the sun rose on the first day of the second era of Taliban rule in Afghanistan, a brief

80
00:05:55,780 --> 00:05:59,900
lull from chaos, along with the official announcement that the US military had taken

81
00:05:59,900 --> 00:06:05,280
over air traffic control at the airport, allowed a Turkish Airlines 777, a civilian aircraft

82
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:09,700
that just the day prior had flown a regular flight from San Francisco to Istanbul, to

83
00:06:09,700 --> 00:06:14,020
land in order to pick up Turkish citizens still left in the country.

84
00:06:14,020 --> 00:06:18,380
It parked on the military side of the airport, north of the runway, around which military

85
00:06:18,380 --> 00:06:21,540
forces had established a security perimeter.

86
00:06:21,540 --> 00:06:27,900
For the following hours, as the aircraft loaded, the situation deteriorated once again.

87
00:06:27,900 --> 00:06:33,360
Satellite imagery taken at 1036 am displays the state of chaos.

88
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:37,860
The airport's southern gate was thoroughly breached, with individuals flowing freely

89
00:06:37,860 --> 00:06:38,860
through.

90
00:06:38,860 --> 00:06:42,900
Four military vehicles appeared to be working to contain crowds of people to the civilian

91
00:06:42,900 --> 00:06:44,340
aircraft apron.

92
00:06:44,340 --> 00:06:47,940
Others had already made it further, and were strewn across the runway.

93
00:06:48,260 --> 00:06:53,480
A line of US military vehicles denoted their security perimeter, preventing anyone from

94
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:57,960
advancing further north into the military area of the airport from where evacuation

95
00:06:57,960 --> 00:06:59,620
flights were leaving.

96
00:06:59,620 --> 00:07:03,700
Two other vehicles flanked the crowd on each side to prevent the runway incursion from

97
00:07:03,700 --> 00:07:04,700
widening.

98
00:07:04,700 --> 00:07:10,180
Meanwhile, to the east, the Turkish Airlines 777 sat idle, filled with its evacuees, just

99
00:07:10,180 --> 00:07:13,740
waiting for a clear runway, in order to take off.

100
00:07:13,740 --> 00:07:18,100
Without much progress, it later taxied back to the apron as the military worked to clear

101
00:07:18,100 --> 00:07:19,100
the runway.

102
00:07:19,100 --> 00:07:24,700
They were successful enough that a US Air Force C-17 was able to land at 1230 pm, but

103
00:07:24,700 --> 00:07:28,200
the aircraft was quickly swarmed by the same crowds.

104
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:32,980
As Apache helicopters flew low across the runway in an attempt to clear people away,

105
00:07:32,980 --> 00:07:38,500
the C-17's pilots decided to depart immediately without dropping off their cargo or loading

106
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:39,860
evacuees.

107
00:07:39,860 --> 00:07:45,580
Inexplicably, dozens of individuals clung to the aircraft as it taxied, and some, perhaps

108
00:07:45,580 --> 00:07:50,940
unaware of the aircraft's intention to take off, did not let go.

109
00:07:50,940 --> 00:07:55,060
Gruesome video soon emerged depicting two individuals falling hundreds of feet to their

110
00:07:55,060 --> 00:08:00,000
death after takeoff, and human remains were later found in the aircraft's wheel well

111
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,740
upon its return to Qatar.

112
00:08:02,740 --> 00:08:08,620
This included Fada Mohamed, a young dentist from the outskirts of Kabul, and Zaki Anwari,

113
00:08:08,620 --> 00:08:14,220
a teenage soccer star who played center-back on the country's youth national team.

114
00:08:14,220 --> 00:08:17,860
Perhaps the crowds were rattled by their deaths, perhaps the military took them as a sign to

115
00:08:17,860 --> 00:08:22,620
intensify their efforts, or perhaps something entirely different occurred, but one way or

116
00:08:22,620 --> 00:08:28,260
another, the runway was cleared and two US Air Force C-130 Hercules aircraft were able

117
00:08:28,260 --> 00:08:31,180
to depart around 1250 pm.

118
00:08:31,180 --> 00:08:35,240
The Turkish Airlines 777 left 25 minutes after that.

119
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:39,560
The rest of the afternoon of August 16th was more of the same—planes would land

120
00:08:39,560 --> 00:08:44,140
and take off for a period, the situation would intensify, flights would halt, and then start

121
00:08:44,140 --> 00:08:47,120
again once the chaos settled down.

122
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:52,160
White House evacuation numbers suggest that the record-breaking early morning C-17 flight

123
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:57,440
was likely the only departure to include civilian evacuees on August 16th, as little success

124
00:08:57,440 --> 00:09:02,400
was had in the afternoon, with the airfield in such a state of anarchy.

125
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:08,920
Meanwhile, 7,000 miles or 11,000 kilometers away, Joe Biden was on board Marine One, making

126
00:09:08,920 --> 00:09:14,180
the brief, 40-minute flight from Camp David, the presidential country retreat, to the White

127
00:09:14,180 --> 00:09:15,300
House.

128
00:09:15,300 --> 00:09:20,780
The fact that the president was on vacation was indicative of the situation—his administration

129
00:09:20,780 --> 00:09:24,320
never expected the Taliban to conquer Kabul so quickly.

130
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:30,180
The criticism for the bungling of the withdrawal was resounding—just 26% of Americans surveyed

131
00:09:30,180 --> 00:09:34,460
supported the president's handling of the situation, and his overall approval rating

132
00:09:34,460 --> 00:09:36,540
took a nosedive.

133
00:09:36,540 --> 00:09:41,660
By the evening of August 16th, Kabul had fallen, the airport was in a state of chaos, and there

134
00:09:41,660 --> 00:09:45,860
was little the Biden administration could do to remedy the situation.

135
00:09:45,860 --> 00:09:50,300
Upon landing at the White House, the president walked into the East Room, and as dozens of

136
00:09:50,300 --> 00:09:56,500
cameras stared him down, he made his first public statement since the fall of Kabul.

137
00:09:56,500 --> 00:10:00,860
After a defiant rebuttal of criticism over the withdrawal decision and sober condolences

138
00:10:00,860 --> 00:10:06,140
to those affected by the situation, the topic shifted towards the ongoing evacuation effort,

139
00:10:06,140 --> 00:10:07,940
with Biden saying, quote,

140
00:10:07,940 --> 00:10:12,800
Our current military mission will be short in time, limited in scope, and focused in

141
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:14,180
its objectives.

142
00:10:14,180 --> 00:10:18,780
Get our people and our allies to safety as quickly as possible.

143
00:10:18,780 --> 00:10:24,200
The evacuation was all that was left of the 20-year war in Afghanistan, so it was the

144
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:29,840
last mission that could sway public opinion over the White House's handling of the situation.

145
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:34,960
Therefore, the combined efforts of dozens of government agencies were all concentrated

146
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:41,880
on getting as many endangered people as possible out of Afghanistan as soon as possible.

147
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:47,760
By the end of the week of August 15th, after days of steady but slower progress, the pieces

148
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:53,000
had been put in place to initiate a dramatic ramp-up in evacuations.

149
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:57,680
For any individual eligible to take an American flight, typically through status as an American

150
00:10:57,680 --> 00:11:02,720
citizen, resident, or special immigrant visa holder or applicant, the first step was to

151
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:05,400
actually get to the airport.

152
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:08,160
This was no small feat.

153
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:12,760
The Taliban had set up two checkpoints on Airport Road, the main route to the airport,

154
00:11:12,760 --> 00:11:17,360
purportedly to control the flow of people and prevent further chaos.

155
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:22,040
While official Taliban policy was to allow anyone authorized for evacuation by the US

156
00:11:22,040 --> 00:11:26,560
or other nations through, there was often disconnect between policy and practice with

157
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:31,720
the group, so whether someone safely and successfully made it to the airport was largely up to the

158
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:36,400
discretion of the individual Taliban fighters operating such checkpoints.

159
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:40,560
The main civilian entrance to the airport was under Taliban control, so evacuees were

160
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:45,220
typically instructed to make their way to the Abbey, East, or North Gates.

161
00:11:45,220 --> 00:11:50,160
From there, if they could work their way through the crowds and chaos, their eligibility for

162
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:54,200
evacuation would be checked, and a member of the military would pat them down to check

163
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:57,220
for weapons before letting them through.

164
00:11:57,220 --> 00:12:00,840
Evacuees would then make their way to the apron on the military side of the airport,

165
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:05,320
where they'd load onto, typically, a C-17 or C-130.

166
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:10,080
To maximize capacity, floor-loading procedures were used, where cargo straps were laid across

167
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:15,080
the floor for passengers to hold onto during takeoff, landing, and turbulence.

168
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:19,600
This way, the passenger density was far higher than if using seats.

169
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:24,440
With the cargo bay doors closed on each flight, hundreds of evacuees glimpsed out at what

170
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:30,000
would almost certainly be their final view of the country they called home.

171
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:35,300
From there, American evacuation flights typically flew southwest for three hours, landing at

172
00:12:35,300 --> 00:12:37,800
Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar.

173
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:42,280
This is the largest US military installation in the Middle East, and in many ways acts

174
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:45,000
as its headquarters of operations in the region.

175
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:49,840
For this mission, the base served as an interim stopover point as the evacuees awaited an

176
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:53,760
initial round of security screening before onward travel.

177
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:57,040
Conditions were undoubtedly rough.

178
00:12:57,040 --> 00:13:01,760
The military used cavernous aircraft hangars and temporary cots to house the evacuees,

179
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:06,200
but with limited climate control, engineers struggled to find solutions to keep the space

180
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:09,720
cool in the intense heat of the Qatari desert.

181
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:14,780
Al Udeid Air Base quickly became a bottleneck, and on August 20th, flights out of Kabul were

182
00:13:14,780 --> 00:13:18,660
halted for a few hours as the facility reached capacity.

183
00:13:18,660 --> 00:13:23,180
The global US military logistics system kicked into gear, though, as portable air-conditioned

184
00:13:23,180 --> 00:13:27,820
tents and toilets were flown in to increase capacity and improve conditions.

185
00:13:27,820 --> 00:13:33,060
The main focus, however, was to get evacuees out of Qatar as fast as possible, move them

186
00:13:33,060 --> 00:13:36,660
towards their destination, and make room for more.

187
00:13:36,660 --> 00:13:42,380
To enable this, the President activated the rarely-used Civil Reserve Air Fleet.

188
00:13:42,380 --> 00:13:47,180
Essentially, in order to compete for regular peacetime contracts to transport US military

189
00:13:47,180 --> 00:13:52,340
members and supplies around the world, airlines in the US sign up as part of this reserve

190
00:13:52,340 --> 00:13:56,760
air fleet, which can be activated when an emergency dictates that a need for aircraft

191
00:13:56,760 --> 00:14:02,060
capacity exceeds the practical capacity of US military aircraft.

192
00:14:02,060 --> 00:14:04,500
This was such an instance.

193
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:10,700
Therefore, 18 aircraft from American Airlines, Atlas Air, United Airlines, Delta Air Lines,

194
00:14:10,700 --> 00:14:14,920
20 Air International, Hawaiian Airlines, and United Airlines were called into service

195
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:17,020
to assist with evacuations.

196
00:14:17,020 --> 00:14:24,460
For example, this United Airlines 777-300, tail number N2352U, landed at Al Udeid at

197
00:14:24,460 --> 00:14:27,480
1019 PM on August 22nd.

198
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:32,700
It spent four hours on the ground, then ferried a full load of evacuees six hours west to

199
00:14:32,700 --> 00:14:35,540
Ramstein Air Base in Germany.

200
00:14:35,540 --> 00:14:41,020
Ramstein, similar to Al Udeid, is the largest American base in Europe and effectively operates

201
00:14:41,020 --> 00:14:47,220
at the scale of a small city with up to 50,000 Americans living in and around the base.

202
00:14:47,220 --> 00:14:51,820
One of its major roles is to provide logistics capabilities, meaning it quite often serves

203
00:14:51,820 --> 00:14:56,540
as a stopping point for military aircraft traveling between the US and the Middle East.

204
00:14:56,540 --> 00:15:02,180
Therefore, it had the perfect position and scale to relieve stress from Al Udeid.

205
00:15:02,180 --> 00:15:06,900
In the more hospitable German climate, there was no longer the issue of inhumane heat,

206
00:15:06,900 --> 00:15:12,220
so the military set up a sprawling complex of tents and cots.

207
00:15:12,220 --> 00:15:17,020
Evacuated kids were even able to set up a daily soccer match on a patch of grass.

208
00:15:17,020 --> 00:15:22,260
Civilian volunteers helped distribute mountains of donated clothes, sanitary products, toys,

209
00:15:22,260 --> 00:15:27,260
and more to the evacuees, who had to leave almost all their possessions behind—only

210
00:15:27,260 --> 00:15:29,960
permitted to take a single bag.

211
00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:35,160
After further security screening and immigration processing, evacuees were ready to finally

212
00:15:35,160 --> 00:15:37,200
head to the United States.

213
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:42,480
The same aforementioned United Airlines 777 loaded up to fly this leg for the first time

214
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:47,320
on August 23rd, and then made the seven and a half hour flight west to Dulles Airport

215
00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:49,780
just outside Washington, DC.

216
00:15:49,780 --> 00:15:54,700
Upon landing, evacuees were tested for COVID, processed through immigration, and finally

217
00:15:54,700 --> 00:15:58,420
took their first steps into the United States.

218
00:15:58,420 --> 00:16:00,780
From there, though, it was more of the same.

219
00:16:00,780 --> 00:16:05,160
They were bussed to the nearby Dulles Expo Center, which acted as temporary housing as

220
00:16:05,160 --> 00:16:07,000
they awaited further travel.

221
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:12,220
In the hours or days waiting there, each evacuee was offered a COVID vaccine and additional

222
00:16:12,220 --> 00:16:14,020
donated items.

223
00:16:14,020 --> 00:16:18,780
Some were bussed to nearby McGuire Air Force Base, Fort Lee, Marine Corps Base Quantico,

224
00:16:18,780 --> 00:16:23,860
or Fort Pickett, while others boarded further flights to Fort McCoy in Wisconsin, Fort Bliss

225
00:16:23,860 --> 00:16:27,780
in Texas, or Holloman Air Force Base in New Mexico.

226
00:16:27,780 --> 00:16:32,320
These bases served as slightly longer-term housing for the evacuees, as they awaited

227
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:36,940
a final round of immigration processing, before being connected with a refugee resettlement

228
00:16:36,940 --> 00:16:43,460
organization to assist them in setting up their new lives somewhere in the United States.

229
00:16:43,460 --> 00:16:48,220
This entire evacuation process happened at a breakneck pace.

230
00:16:48,220 --> 00:16:54,140
Kabul to Al Udeid, Al Udeid to Ramstein, and Ramstein to Dulles likely became the busiest

231
00:16:54,140 --> 00:16:59,140
three international flight routes in the world for a few days, even as other bases

232
00:16:59,140 --> 00:17:03,820
in Kuwait, Italy, Spain, and elsewhere were brought online as interim stopping points

233
00:17:03,820 --> 00:17:07,580
to relieve pressure on this main evacuation route as well.

234
00:17:07,580 --> 00:17:14,180
The system was able to ramp up to a peak of 13,000 evacuations a day on US military aircraft,

235
00:17:14,180 --> 00:17:20,360
as well as an additional 9,000 on civilian and allied military aircraft on August 24th.

236
00:17:20,360 --> 00:17:24,560
The system was also, however, imperfect.

237
00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:30,200
One crucial weakness was that the US military's role in administering Kabul Airport required

238
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:35,480
at least some direct interface between service members and the general public.

239
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:40,680
Specifically, that occurred here, at AbiGate, where troops checked individuals' eligibility

240
00:17:40,680 --> 00:17:44,000
to enter and searched them for weapons.

241
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:48,120
This was necessary to ensure the safety of the flights.

242
00:17:48,120 --> 00:17:52,520
In theory, most people at this location would have already passed through Taliban security

243
00:17:52,520 --> 00:17:56,960
checkpoints, but these were irregular and imperfect.

244
00:17:56,960 --> 00:18:04,240
Consequently, taking advantage of the densely packed chaos, on August 26th, at 5.50 pm,

245
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:09,560
a suicide bomber from ISIS-K detonated their explosive vest and a gunman from the terrorist

246
00:18:09,560 --> 00:18:12,560
group then fired into the crowd.

247
00:18:12,560 --> 00:18:19,160
169 civilians and 13 American service members were killed.

248
00:18:19,160 --> 00:18:24,160
By the 26th, the bulk of the evacuation was already completed, and so the suicide bombing

249
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:27,300
had little effect on the success of the mission.

250
00:18:27,300 --> 00:18:32,440
One by one, over the coming days, American allied nations announced the last of their

251
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:36,720
evacuation flights, and the end of their presence in Afghanistan.

252
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:42,240
Australia, France, New Zealand, Italy, and more finished on the 27th.

253
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:47,040
The UK, the second most involved nation in the evacuations, finished its effort on the

254
00:18:47,040 --> 00:18:51,400
28th, with all of its troops out of the country by the following day.

255
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:57,880
Then, on August 30th, a few minutes before midnight, Ross Wilson, acting US ambassador

256
00:18:57,880 --> 00:19:04,360
to Afghanistan, boarded a C-17 followed by Chris Donahue, commanding general of the 82nd

257
00:19:04,360 --> 00:19:05,780
Airborne Division.

258
00:19:05,820 --> 00:19:12,380
Behind him, the cargo bay door closed, the aircraft taxied, rolled down the runway, took

259
00:19:12,380 --> 00:19:16,380
off, and banked towards the south.

260
00:19:16,380 --> 00:19:24,420
With that moment, for the first time in 19 years, ten months, three weeks, and two days,

261
00:19:24,420 --> 00:19:35,380
the US military had no presence in Afghanistan, and the war was finally and officially over.

262
00:19:35,380 --> 00:19:40,480
Then once each of these tens of thousands of evacuees are safely in the US, the process

263
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:42,500
is far from over.

264
00:19:42,500 --> 00:19:47,060
Right now, one of the largest and fastest resettlement efforts in history is kicking

265
00:19:47,060 --> 00:19:51,780
into gear, and the logistics of helping such a mass of people set up new lives in such

266
00:19:51,780 --> 00:19:54,880
a short amount of time are also fascinating.

267
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:59,540
As this video was already getting far too long, I made another video on that topic and

268
00:19:59,540 --> 00:20:01,580
put it exclusively on Nebula.

269
00:20:01,580 --> 00:20:06,700
I'm able to do that because Nebula was built by creators, including myself, from the ground

270
00:20:06,700 --> 00:20:10,740
up to be able to enable us to make even better and more unique content.

271
00:20:10,740 --> 00:20:15,220
That's why I've been able to make multiple big-budget Nebula originals, release my regular

272
00:20:15,220 --> 00:20:19,760
videos there early and ad-free, and do these exclusive companion videos.

273
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:23,440
We also want new viewers to be able to watch our stuff on there, so we've partnered with

274
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:27,900
