00:10.400 --> 00:16.520
On August 15th, 2021, Taliban fighters encircled Kabul.

00:16.520 --> 00:21.960
Over the hours, days, and weeks prior, they had swept across the nation, toppling provincial

00:21.960 --> 00:24.520
capital after provincial capital.

00:24.720 --> 00:31.240
Now, their grand prize—their return to rule after 20 years of war with the West—was

00:31.240 --> 00:32.740
within sight.

00:32.740 --> 00:37.280
As police put on street clothes, retailers raised the price of burkas, and workers painted

00:37.280 --> 00:43.240
over pictures of women, Hamid Karzai International Airport maintained an eerie impression of

00:43.240 --> 00:44.240
normalcy.

00:44.240 --> 00:48.640
It was certainly busy, with civilians fleeing on commercial flights, governments evacuating

00:48.640 --> 00:53.400
their diplomatic staff, and airlines relocating their aircraft to more stable nations, but

00:53.400 --> 00:59.100
the way Kabul's airport operated that morning was broadly the way it operated any morning.

00:59.100 --> 01:05.200
At 1042 AM, a Pakistan International Airlines 777-200 landed from Islamabad.

01:05.200 --> 01:11.840
At 1126, a Qatar Airways 777-300ER touched down on a charter flight from Doha.

01:11.840 --> 01:19.060
Shortly after, at 1149, a Kam Air A340 left on its daily run to Delhi.

01:19.060 --> 01:23.600
In spite of the foreboding feeling in the air, the airport fulfilled its regular role

01:23.600 --> 01:26.460
for the bustling Middle Eastern metropolis.

01:26.460 --> 01:28.140
But then came the news.

01:28.140 --> 01:34.620
Shortly after noon, the Taliban's spokesperson, Zabuhullah Mujahid, issued a statement.

01:34.620 --> 01:39.740
Their forces had encircled Kabul, and they intended to enter.

01:39.740 --> 01:45.540
Still, the planes kept coming, having allocated each one of their seats to those lucky enough

01:45.540 --> 01:47.620
to find an available ticket.

01:47.620 --> 01:53.160
As an Air India A320 approached, however, ATC stopped responding.

01:53.160 --> 01:57.780
With panic setting in on the ground, controllers had abandoned their posts, so in the air,

01:57.780 --> 02:02.460
the A320 entered a holding pattern until its pilots determined a course of action.

02:02.460 --> 02:08.140
12,000 feet above, an Emirates 777 did the same until it diverted back to Dubai, but

02:08.140 --> 02:12.980
one hour later, finally, the Air India aircraft successfully landed.

02:12.980 --> 02:17.780
In the hours that followed, without any ATC clearance, the Pakistan International Airlines

02:17.780 --> 02:24.500
777, Qatar Airways 777, Air India A320, and a Pakistan International Airlines A320 each

02:24.500 --> 02:29.420
departed for their destinations, but the most significant departure was not one of the afternoon's

02:29.420 --> 02:32.620
planes, but a passenger aboard it.

02:32.620 --> 02:38.760
At 456 PM, Tolo News, one of Afghanistan's largest broadcasters, reported that President

02:38.760 --> 02:42.480
Ashraf Ghani had fled the country.

02:42.480 --> 02:46.300
The Islamic Republic of Afghanistan was no longer.

02:46.300 --> 02:49.960
The Taliban were in control.

02:49.960 --> 02:53.360
Soon after, its forces entered Kabul.

02:53.360 --> 03:00.600
At 738 PM, a Kam Air 737 left on the Afghan Airlines regular evening run to Islamabad,

03:00.600 --> 03:06.480
representing Kabul's last regularly scheduled commercial flight for days, weeks, or maybe

03:06.480 --> 03:07.480
more.

03:07.480 --> 03:11.760
Meanwhile, the Taliban took control of the ark, Afghanistan's presidential palace,

03:12.040 --> 03:16.520
and the first photos emerged displaying the finality of the situation.

03:16.520 --> 03:19.560
Reactions around Kabul were mixed.

03:19.560 --> 03:20.560
Some celebrated.

03:20.560 --> 03:26.100
The jihadist group does have some public support, so Kabul's streets were roamed by men enjoying

03:26.100 --> 03:29.480
what was, in their minds, a victorious night.

03:29.480 --> 03:34.840
Others, including nearly all women, hid in their homes, worried for potential violence

03:34.840 --> 03:37.360
and for the future of their country.

03:37.800 --> 03:44.240
Then there were those who feared for their lives—journalists, activists, former government

03:44.240 --> 03:49.360
officials, along with interpreters, security guards, and others who had worked with American,

03:49.360 --> 03:51.880
NATO, and NATO Allied forces.

03:51.880 --> 03:57.400
The desperation was undoubtedly profound because as soon as Kabul's fall was no longer in

03:57.400 --> 04:02.680
question, scores of people worked their way through the streets towards the same destination—Kabul

04:02.680 --> 04:04.160
Airport.

04:04.160 --> 04:08.720
The Taliban already controlled every one of Afghanistan's land border crossings, so

04:08.720 --> 04:14.120
the airport was truly the singular way out for those who needed to leave.

04:14.120 --> 04:18.760
Surrounded by dense urban sprawl and located mere miles from the city center, Hamid Karzai

04:18.760 --> 04:23.360
International Airport is a nightmare from a perimeter security perspective.

04:23.360 --> 04:27.960
It was hardly difficult for those who flocked there to scale its walls, and across the evening

04:27.960 --> 04:33.520
of August 15th, thousands made it onto the airfield, desperate to find any flight, with

04:33.520 --> 04:37.760
any seat, going anywhere but Afghanistan.

04:37.760 --> 04:42.280
In the days leading up to the fall of Kabul, the US had ramped up its evacuation efforts,

04:42.280 --> 04:47.680
largely in the mission of evacuating its diplomatic staff before the situation deteriorated further.

04:47.680 --> 04:52.960
Therefore, it had already deployed thousands of troops and effectively relocated its embassy,

04:52.960 --> 04:56.200
and the key staff that ran it, to the airport.

04:56.200 --> 05:02.200
Amidst the chaos, a single C-17 was scheduled to depart, filled with hundreds of individuals

05:02.200 --> 05:06.320
adorned with a wristband, indicating that they had been authorized to travel on an American

05:06.320 --> 05:11.280
evacuation flight, due to their status as an individual believed to be in acute danger

05:11.280 --> 05:13.040
under Taliban rule.

05:13.040 --> 05:18.900
The manifest for this flight, Reach 871, soon became moot, as hundreds who were not assigned

05:18.900 --> 05:23.360
to the particular flight, but were cleared to fly, rushed the cargo bay.

05:23.360 --> 05:27.580
The aircraft became packed far beyond its operating limit, but faced with the alternative

05:27.580 --> 05:31.860
of spending hours reloading the aircraft properly as the airfield's condition decayed

05:31.860 --> 05:38.620
further, Reach 871's commander chose to break protocol and take off at 1.27 am on

05:38.620 --> 05:40.820
August 16th.

05:40.820 --> 05:46.820
823 passengers were packed onto the aircraft's floor, easily breaking the record for the

05:46.820 --> 05:49.760
most people carried by a C-17.

05:49.760 --> 05:55.780
As the sun rose on the first day of the second era of Taliban rule in Afghanistan, a brief

05:55.780 --> 05:59.900
lull from chaos, along with the official announcement that the US military had taken

05:59.900 --> 06:05.280
over air traffic control at the airport, allowed a Turkish Airlines 777, a civilian aircraft

06:05.280 --> 06:09.700
that just the day prior had flown a regular flight from San Francisco to Istanbul, to

06:09.700 --> 06:14.020
land in order to pick up Turkish citizens still left in the country.

06:14.020 --> 06:18.380
It parked on the military side of the airport, north of the runway, around which military

06:18.380 --> 06:21.540
forces had established a security perimeter.

06:21.540 --> 06:27.900
For the following hours, as the aircraft loaded, the situation deteriorated once again.

06:27.900 --> 06:33.360
Satellite imagery taken at 1036 am displays the state of chaos.

06:33.360 --> 06:37.860
The airport's southern gate was thoroughly breached, with individuals flowing freely

06:37.860 --> 06:38.860
through.

06:38.860 --> 06:42.900
Four military vehicles appeared to be working to contain crowds of people to the civilian

06:42.900 --> 06:44.340
aircraft apron.

06:44.340 --> 06:47.940
Others had already made it further, and were strewn across the runway.

06:48.260 --> 06:53.480
A line of US military vehicles denoted their security perimeter, preventing anyone from

06:53.480 --> 06:57.960
advancing further north into the military area of the airport from where evacuation

06:57.960 --> 06:59.620
flights were leaving.

06:59.620 --> 07:03.700
Two other vehicles flanked the crowd on each side to prevent the runway incursion from

07:03.700 --> 07:04.700
widening.

07:04.700 --> 07:10.180
Meanwhile, to the east, the Turkish Airlines 777 sat idle, filled with its evacuees, just

07:10.180 --> 07:13.740
waiting for a clear runway, in order to take off.

07:13.740 --> 07:18.100
Without much progress, it later taxied back to the apron as the military worked to clear

07:18.100 --> 07:19.100
the runway.

07:19.100 --> 07:24.700
They were successful enough that a US Air Force C-17 was able to land at 1230 pm, but

07:24.700 --> 07:28.200
the aircraft was quickly swarmed by the same crowds.

07:28.200 --> 07:32.980
As Apache helicopters flew low across the runway in an attempt to clear people away,

07:32.980 --> 07:38.500
the C-17's pilots decided to depart immediately without dropping off their cargo or loading

07:38.500 --> 07:39.860
evacuees.

07:39.860 --> 07:45.580
Inexplicably, dozens of individuals clung to the aircraft as it taxied, and some, perhaps

07:45.580 --> 07:50.940
unaware of the aircraft's intention to take off, did not let go.

07:50.940 --> 07:55.060
Gruesome video soon emerged depicting two individuals falling hundreds of feet to their

07:55.060 --> 08:00.000
death after takeoff, and human remains were later found in the aircraft's wheel well

08:00.000 --> 08:02.740
upon its return to Qatar.

08:02.740 --> 08:08.620
This included Fada Mohamed, a young dentist from the outskirts of Kabul, and Zaki Anwari,

08:08.620 --> 08:14.220
a teenage soccer star who played center-back on the country's youth national team.

08:14.220 --> 08:17.860
Perhaps the crowds were rattled by their deaths, perhaps the military took them as a sign to

08:17.860 --> 08:22.620
intensify their efforts, or perhaps something entirely different occurred, but one way or

08:22.620 --> 08:28.260
another, the runway was cleared and two US Air Force C-130 Hercules aircraft were able

08:28.260 --> 08:31.180
to depart around 1250 pm.

08:31.180 --> 08:35.240
The Turkish Airlines 777 left 25 minutes after that.

08:35.240 --> 08:39.560
The rest of the afternoon of August 16th was more of the same—planes would land

08:39.560 --> 08:44.140
and take off for a period, the situation would intensify, flights would halt, and then start

08:44.140 --> 08:47.120
again once the chaos settled down.

08:47.120 --> 08:52.160
White House evacuation numbers suggest that the record-breaking early morning C-17 flight

08:52.160 --> 08:57.440
was likely the only departure to include civilian evacuees on August 16th, as little success

08:57.440 --> 09:02.400
was had in the afternoon, with the airfield in such a state of anarchy.

09:02.400 --> 09:08.920
Meanwhile, 7,000 miles or 11,000 kilometers away, Joe Biden was on board Marine One, making

09:08.920 --> 09:14.180
the brief, 40-minute flight from Camp David, the presidential country retreat, to the White

09:14.180 --> 09:15.300
House.

09:15.300 --> 09:20.780
The fact that the president was on vacation was indicative of the situation—his administration

09:20.780 --> 09:24.320
never expected the Taliban to conquer Kabul so quickly.

09:24.320 --> 09:30.180
The criticism for the bungling of the withdrawal was resounding—just 26% of Americans surveyed

09:30.180 --> 09:34.460
supported the president's handling of the situation, and his overall approval rating

09:34.460 --> 09:36.540
took a nosedive.

09:36.540 --> 09:41.660
By the evening of August 16th, Kabul had fallen, the airport was in a state of chaos, and there

09:41.660 --> 09:45.860
was little the Biden administration could do to remedy the situation.

09:45.860 --> 09:50.300
Upon landing at the White House, the president walked into the East Room, and as dozens of

09:50.300 --> 09:56.500
cameras stared him down, he made his first public statement since the fall of Kabul.

09:56.500 --> 10:00.860
After a defiant rebuttal of criticism over the withdrawal decision and sober condolences

10:00.860 --> 10:06.140
to those affected by the situation, the topic shifted towards the ongoing evacuation effort,

10:06.140 --> 10:07.940
with Biden saying, quote,

10:07.940 --> 10:12.800
Our current military mission will be short in time, limited in scope, and focused in

10:12.800 --> 10:14.180
its objectives.

10:14.180 --> 10:18.780
Get our people and our allies to safety as quickly as possible.

10:18.780 --> 10:24.200
The evacuation was all that was left of the 20-year war in Afghanistan, so it was the

10:24.200 --> 10:29.840
last mission that could sway public opinion over the White House's handling of the situation.

10:29.840 --> 10:34.960
Therefore, the combined efforts of dozens of government agencies were all concentrated

10:34.960 --> 10:41.880
on getting as many endangered people as possible out of Afghanistan as soon as possible.

10:41.880 --> 10:47.760
By the end of the week of August 15th, after days of steady but slower progress, the pieces

10:47.760 --> 10:53.000
had been put in place to initiate a dramatic ramp-up in evacuations.

10:53.000 --> 10:57.680
For any individual eligible to take an American flight, typically through status as an American

10:57.680 --> 11:02.720
citizen, resident, or special immigrant visa holder or applicant, the first step was to

11:02.720 --> 11:05.400
actually get to the airport.

11:05.400 --> 11:08.160
This was no small feat.

11:08.160 --> 11:12.760
The Taliban had set up two checkpoints on Airport Road, the main route to the airport,

11:12.760 --> 11:17.360
purportedly to control the flow of people and prevent further chaos.

11:17.360 --> 11:22.040
While official Taliban policy was to allow anyone authorized for evacuation by the US

11:22.040 --> 11:26.560
or other nations through, there was often disconnect between policy and practice with

11:26.560 --> 11:31.720
the group, so whether someone safely and successfully made it to the airport was largely up to the

11:31.720 --> 11:36.400
discretion of the individual Taliban fighters operating such checkpoints.

11:36.400 --> 11:40.560
The main civilian entrance to the airport was under Taliban control, so evacuees were

11:40.560 --> 11:45.220
typically instructed to make their way to the Abbey, East, or North Gates.

11:45.220 --> 11:50.160
From there, if they could work their way through the crowds and chaos, their eligibility for

11:50.160 --> 11:54.200
evacuation would be checked, and a member of the military would pat them down to check

11:54.200 --> 11:57.220
for weapons before letting them through.

11:57.220 --> 12:00.840
Evacuees would then make their way to the apron on the military side of the airport,

12:00.840 --> 12:05.320
where they'd load onto, typically, a C-17 or C-130.

12:05.320 --> 12:10.080
To maximize capacity, floor-loading procedures were used, where cargo straps were laid across

12:10.080 --> 12:15.080
the floor for passengers to hold onto during takeoff, landing, and turbulence.

12:15.080 --> 12:19.600
This way, the passenger density was far higher than if using seats.

12:19.600 --> 12:24.440
With the cargo bay doors closed on each flight, hundreds of evacuees glimpsed out at what

12:24.440 --> 12:30.000
would almost certainly be their final view of the country they called home.

12:30.000 --> 12:35.300
From there, American evacuation flights typically flew southwest for three hours, landing at

12:35.300 --> 12:37.800
Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar.

12:37.800 --> 12:42.280
This is the largest US military installation in the Middle East, and in many ways acts

12:42.280 --> 12:45.000
as its headquarters of operations in the region.

12:45.000 --> 12:49.840
For this mission, the base served as an interim stopover point as the evacuees awaited an

12:49.840 --> 12:53.760
initial round of security screening before onward travel.

12:53.760 --> 12:57.040
Conditions were undoubtedly rough.

12:57.040 --> 13:01.760
The military used cavernous aircraft hangars and temporary cots to house the evacuees,

13:01.760 --> 13:06.200
but with limited climate control, engineers struggled to find solutions to keep the space

13:06.200 --> 13:09.720
cool in the intense heat of the Qatari desert.

13:09.720 --> 13:14.780
Al Udeid Air Base quickly became a bottleneck, and on August 20th, flights out of Kabul were

13:14.780 --> 13:18.660
halted for a few hours as the facility reached capacity.

13:18.660 --> 13:23.180
The global US military logistics system kicked into gear, though, as portable air-conditioned

13:23.180 --> 13:27.820
tents and toilets were flown in to increase capacity and improve conditions.

13:27.820 --> 13:33.060
The main focus, however, was to get evacuees out of Qatar as fast as possible, move them

13:33.060 --> 13:36.660
towards their destination, and make room for more.

13:36.660 --> 13:42.380
To enable this, the President activated the rarely-used Civil Reserve Air Fleet.

13:42.380 --> 13:47.180
Essentially, in order to compete for regular peacetime contracts to transport US military

13:47.180 --> 13:52.340
members and supplies around the world, airlines in the US sign up as part of this reserve

13:52.340 --> 13:56.760
air fleet, which can be activated when an emergency dictates that a need for aircraft

13:56.760 --> 14:02.060
capacity exceeds the practical capacity of US military aircraft.

14:02.060 --> 14:04.500
This was such an instance.

14:04.500 --> 14:10.700
Therefore, 18 aircraft from American Airlines, Atlas Air, United Airlines, Delta Air Lines,

14:10.700 --> 14:14.920
20 Air International, Hawaiian Airlines, and United Airlines were called into service

14:14.920 --> 14:17.020
to assist with evacuations.

14:17.020 --> 14:24.460
For example, this United Airlines 777-300, tail number N2352U, landed at Al Udeid at

14:24.460 --> 14:27.480
1019 PM on August 22nd.

14:27.480 --> 14:32.700
It spent four hours on the ground, then ferried a full load of evacuees six hours west to

14:32.700 --> 14:35.540
Ramstein Air Base in Germany.

14:35.540 --> 14:41.020
Ramstein, similar to Al Udeid, is the largest American base in Europe and effectively operates

14:41.020 --> 14:47.220
at the scale of a small city with up to 50,000 Americans living in and around the base.

14:47.220 --> 14:51.820
One of its major roles is to provide logistics capabilities, meaning it quite often serves

14:51.820 --> 14:56.540
as a stopping point for military aircraft traveling between the US and the Middle East.

14:56.540 --> 15:02.180
Therefore, it had the perfect position and scale to relieve stress from Al Udeid.

15:02.180 --> 15:06.900
In the more hospitable German climate, there was no longer the issue of inhumane heat,

15:06.900 --> 15:12.220
so the military set up a sprawling complex of tents and cots.

15:12.220 --> 15:17.020
Evacuated kids were even able to set up a daily soccer match on a patch of grass.

15:17.020 --> 15:22.260
Civilian volunteers helped distribute mountains of donated clothes, sanitary products, toys,

15:22.260 --> 15:27.260
and more to the evacuees, who had to leave almost all their possessions behind—only

15:27.260 --> 15:29.960
permitted to take a single bag.

15:29.960 --> 15:35.160
After further security screening and immigration processing, evacuees were ready to finally

15:35.160 --> 15:37.200
head to the United States.

15:37.200 --> 15:42.480
The same aforementioned United Airlines 777 loaded up to fly this leg for the first time

15:42.480 --> 15:47.320
on August 23rd, and then made the seven and a half hour flight west to Dulles Airport

15:47.320 --> 15:49.780
just outside Washington, DC.

15:49.780 --> 15:54.700
Upon landing, evacuees were tested for COVID, processed through immigration, and finally

15:54.700 --> 15:58.420
took their first steps into the United States.

15:58.420 --> 16:00.780
From there, though, it was more of the same.

16:00.780 --> 16:05.160
They were bussed to the nearby Dulles Expo Center, which acted as temporary housing as

16:05.160 --> 16:07.000
they awaited further travel.

16:07.000 --> 16:12.220
In the hours or days waiting there, each evacuee was offered a COVID vaccine and additional

16:12.220 --> 16:14.020
donated items.

16:14.020 --> 16:18.780
Some were bussed to nearby McGuire Air Force Base, Fort Lee, Marine Corps Base Quantico,

16:18.780 --> 16:23.860
or Fort Pickett, while others boarded further flights to Fort McCoy in Wisconsin, Fort Bliss

16:23.860 --> 16:27.780
in Texas, or Holloman Air Force Base in New Mexico.

16:27.780 --> 16:32.320
These bases served as slightly longer-term housing for the evacuees, as they awaited

16:32.320 --> 16:36.940
a final round of immigration processing, before being connected with a refugee resettlement

16:36.940 --> 16:43.460
organization to assist them in setting up their new lives somewhere in the United States.

16:43.460 --> 16:48.220
This entire evacuation process happened at a breakneck pace.

16:48.220 --> 16:54.140
Kabul to Al Udeid, Al Udeid to Ramstein, and Ramstein to Dulles likely became the busiest

16:54.140 --> 16:59.140
three international flight routes in the world for a few days, even as other bases

16:59.140 --> 17:03.820
in Kuwait, Italy, Spain, and elsewhere were brought online as interim stopping points

17:03.820 --> 17:07.580
to relieve pressure on this main evacuation route as well.

17:07.580 --> 17:14.180
The system was able to ramp up to a peak of 13,000 evacuations a day on US military aircraft,

17:14.180 --> 17:20.360
as well as an additional 9,000 on civilian and allied military aircraft on August 24th.

17:20.360 --> 17:24.560
The system was also, however, imperfect.

17:24.560 --> 17:30.200
One crucial weakness was that the US military's role in administering Kabul Airport required

17:30.200 --> 17:35.480
at least some direct interface between service members and the general public.

17:35.480 --> 17:40.680
Specifically, that occurred here, at AbiGate, where troops checked individuals' eligibility

17:40.680 --> 17:44.000
to enter and searched them for weapons.

17:44.000 --> 17:48.120
This was necessary to ensure the safety of the flights.

17:48.120 --> 17:52.520
In theory, most people at this location would have already passed through Taliban security

17:52.520 --> 17:56.960
checkpoints, but these were irregular and imperfect.

17:56.960 --> 18:04.240
Consequently, taking advantage of the densely packed chaos, on August 26th, at 5.50 pm,

18:04.240 --> 18:09.560
a suicide bomber from ISIS-K detonated their explosive vest and a gunman from the terrorist

18:09.560 --> 18:12.560
group then fired into the crowd.

18:12.560 --> 18:19.160
169 civilians and 13 American service members were killed.

18:19.160 --> 18:24.160
By the 26th, the bulk of the evacuation was already completed, and so the suicide bombing

18:24.160 --> 18:27.300
had little effect on the success of the mission.

18:27.300 --> 18:32.440
One by one, over the coming days, American allied nations announced the last of their

18:32.440 --> 18:36.720
evacuation flights, and the end of their presence in Afghanistan.

18:36.720 --> 18:42.240
Australia, France, New Zealand, Italy, and more finished on the 27th.

18:42.240 --> 18:47.040
The UK, the second most involved nation in the evacuations, finished its effort on the

18:47.040 --> 18:51.400
28th, with all of its troops out of the country by the following day.

18:51.400 --> 18:57.880
Then, on August 30th, a few minutes before midnight, Ross Wilson, acting US ambassador

18:57.880 --> 19:04.360
to Afghanistan, boarded a C-17 followed by Chris Donahue, commanding general of the 82nd

19:04.360 --> 19:05.780
Airborne Division.

19:05.820 --> 19:12.380
Behind him, the cargo bay door closed, the aircraft taxied, rolled down the runway, took

19:12.380 --> 19:16.380
off, and banked towards the south.

19:16.380 --> 19:24.420
With that moment, for the first time in 19 years, ten months, three weeks, and two days,

19:24.420 --> 19:35.380
the US military had no presence in Afghanistan, and the war was finally and officially over.

19:35.380 --> 19:40.480
Then once each of these tens of thousands of evacuees are safely in the US, the process

19:40.480 --> 19:42.500
is far from over.

19:42.500 --> 19:47.060
Right now, one of the largest and fastest resettlement efforts in history is kicking

19:47.060 --> 19:51.780
into gear, and the logistics of helping such a mass of people set up new lives in such

19:51.780 --> 19:54.880
a short amount of time are also fascinating.

19:54.880 --> 19:59.540
As this video was already getting far too long, I made another video on that topic and

19:59.540 --> 20:01.580
put it exclusively on Nebula.

20:01.580 --> 20:06.700
I'm able to do that because Nebula was built by creators, including myself, from the ground

20:06.700 --> 20:10.740
up to be able to enable us to make even better and more unique content.

20:10.740 --> 20:15.220
That's why I've been able to make multiple big-budget Nebula originals, release my regular

20:15.220 --> 20:19.760
videos there early and ad-free, and do these exclusive companion videos.

20:19.760 --> 20:23.440
We also want new viewers to be able to watch our stuff on there, so we've partnered with

20:23.440 --> 20:27.900
