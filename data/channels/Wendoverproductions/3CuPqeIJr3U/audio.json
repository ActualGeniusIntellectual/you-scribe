China has backed itself into a corner. About a year ago, in spring 2020, it emerged triumphant. After months of devastation, it became the first country to coax life back to near-normal after a widespread COVID epidemic. Just as it emerged from lockdown, the rest of the world was entering into it, so China started to focus its attention on not only recovering from COVID, but also from the hit it took to its global image as a result of perceived mismanagement in the virus' early days. As the US and Europe struggled from far larger, far more devastating outbreaks, China sat on the sidelines, working on ways to be viewed not only as the country that crushed COVID within its borders, but also led the fight against it around the world. They wanted to be seen doing what the US and Europe couldn't while they were focused on their problems at home. As hospital ships docked and intensive care units ballooned in size throughout April and New York, planes were landing at JFK carrying thousands of desperately needed ventilators from China. As hospitals around the world ran out of supplies and required healthcare workers to reuse masks for days or weeks on end, national airlines were making special, dedicated trips to pick up medical supplies donated by China. As every corner of the world worked to ramp up testing to get a more accurate picture of their problems, Chinese-made test kits were streaming through their borders. China was at the center of the fight against the virus, but the center can be the riskiest place to be. As donations turned into purchases, it emerged that there was a major quality problem. Some 90% of mask certifications from China, according to one measure, were fake, tests that were supposed to have 80% sensitivity actually had 30%, and stories emerged globally of Chinese officials demanding public displays of thanks in exchange for donations. What was supposed to be a diplomacy coup rekindled an old narrative of Chinese-made as inferior. At best, this effort did little to rewrite China's role in the pandemic, but at worst, it seems very possible that it actually further damaged their global image. However, while the start and the middle of the pandemic did not entirely go China's way, in terms of global image, there was still the end. China still had the chance to recover what they'd lost, and, more specifically, they had the chance to display their homegrown scientific skill and manufacturing might. China could be the country that supplies the shots that would end the world's misery and put the pandemic in the history books. They could make the world's vaccine, but of course, first, they needed a vaccine. Luckily, they had a head start. As soon as the outbreak began in China, a number of private companies, state-owned enterprises, and government-run institutes started work on developing a vaccine. By spring, there were some strong, viable candidates, so the next step was testing. Just as most of the Western world entered their lockdowns, the first Chinese vaccine, 85-nCoV by CanSino Biologics, entered a phase 1 clinical trial on March 17th, 2020, with 108 adults in Wuhan receiving the shot. Under positive data, this same vaccine became the first in the world to enter phase 2 trials on April 11th, with 508 participants. When the results from that trial were published on July 20th, they revealed that not only was the vaccine acceptably safe, but that it was also generating the desired immune response\u2014in short, it was seemingly both safe and effective. However, the next phase of clinical testing presented a problem for CanSino. You see, phase 1 vaccine trials are about seeing if they're safe, and then phase 2 trials are about seeing if they generate the desired immune response in the body. Phase 3 trials, however, that's about seeing if the vaccine works in the real world\u2014to see if it actually protects humans. To do so, researchers divide the study participants into two equal-sized groups\u2014one receives the actual candidate vaccine, the other receives a placebo shot\u2014typically just a saline solution. Then, the two groups are tracked to see if one is less likely to contract the virus than the other. The problem for CanSino, the other Chinese vaccine makers, and the country as a whole was that, by late summer, when the first Chinese vaccines were moving into phase 3 trials, daily COVID cases in the country had been reduced to double-digit levels in a country of well over a billion. Most phase 3 vaccine trials have below 50,000 participants, so it would take years, if not decades, at those caseloads to get to the hundreds of infections needed in a trial to prove a vaccine's efficacy. Essentially, it was impossible for Chinese companies to complete their COVID vaccines in China exactly because the country had done so well at suppressing the virus. Therefore, they had to move abroad. The CanSino AD5-NCoV vaccine started phase 3 trials in Russia, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Mexico, Argentina, and Chile, while the other leading candidates moved to dozens of other countries with more severe COVID epidemics. However, with many of these, China and its pharmaceutical companies had to curry favor with each government. Typically, that took the form of offering priority access to the very vaccines that they were testing, which was fine\u2026 for the moment. As of now, five Chinese-made vaccines have been approved in the country. In general, there has been widespread criticism of the country's vaccine development practices. They've started vaccinating the general public before their phase 3 trials reached their endpoints, they haven't been forthcoming with clinical trial data, they've misrepresented efficacy ratings from trials, and more, however, despite that, there is evidence that these vaccines are acceptably safe and effective\u2014even if potentially less so than other approved vaccines. On December 30th, the BBIBP-CoV vaccine manufactured by Sinopharm, a Chinese state-owned enterprise, was approved in the country, making it one of the first COVID vaccines in the world to be deployed in the general population. Despite the fact that this vaccine was developed and manufactured by a company owned by the Chinese government, and despite the fact that the country had some 1.4 billion people to inoculate, many of the first doses of the Sinopharm vaccine were sent beyond their borders. Chinese state-owned media reports that the company has orders for its vaccine from over 100 countries, although the details of such orders are not publicly known, leading to some skepticism over the numbers. We do know details for certain orders, though, and in some cases, we might know more than China wants us to. In general, though, China's goal with its global vaccine distribution is essentially to do what it failed to do with masks, ventilators, and tests in 2020. China wants to be the country that ended other countries' epidemics. Now, even though Western vaccines from Moderna and Pfizer have a 95% efficacy rating compared to 50-83% in Chinese vaccines, those Western vaccines have order obligations taking up their inventory well into 2022. However, that's not the case with certain Chinese vaccines, so some countries are making the calculation that it's better to have less effective vaccines sooner than the alternative. Of course, for China, this is a major diplomacy coup. Countries historically allied with the West, such as Hungary and Mexico, are turning to China. In their narrative, China is doing what the West cannot. Of course, they want this to continue, and even ramp up. That's why they've been sending their vaccines all around the world for free. Mongolia and Sri Lanka received 300,000 doses of the Sinopharm vaccine, Algeria, Sierra Leone, and Zimbabwe 200,000, and Belarus, Equatorial Guinea, Gabon, Mozambique, Namibia, and Bolivia 100,000. Now, a couple hundred thousand doses isn't going to end any of these countries' epidemics, but it's enough for clips of healthcare workers receiving Chinese-made and donated vaccinations to make the evening news. It's also enough for each of these countries to see that these vaccines are acceptably safe and effective, giving them little reason to not order more when China is offering them months or years before the big Western manufacturers. However, the fact that many of China's vaccines are made and distributed by state-owned enterprises has led many to wonder whether the country is choosing who gets these life-saving inoculations based on diplomatic intentions. It's leading many to wonder whether who lives and who dies in this pandemic is starting to be based on how friendly the country on a given person's passport is to the People's Republic of China. The answer to this question is not hard to find. On the readout of the call between Chinese DIC Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi and Algerian Foreign Minister Sabri Boukadoum, the Chinese official brought up Algeria's vote 50 years ago to switch Chinese representation at the UN from the Republic of China government, now known as Taiwan, to the People's Republic of China, which most now refer to as China. In addition, the Chinese official noted Algeria's participation in China's Belt and Road Infrastructure Development Initiative, before announcing the country's intention to donate 200,000 Sinopharm vaccine doses to Algeria. Elsewhere, in South America, 10 of its 12 countries have vaccinated their populations with either purchased or donated Chinese vaccines. The only two exceptions are Suriname, the lowest population country on the continent, and Paraguay. Now, Paraguay's absence on the list of countries to have received Chinese vaccines is not tough to figure out\u2014it's because of another list that they are on. Paraguay is one of just 15 countries worldwide that recognizes Taiwan as an independent nation\u2014something that undermines China's claims of the island. In fact, there is zero overlap between the list of countries that recognizes Taiwan and those that have received Chinese COVID vaccines. However, the cases of Algeria and Paraguay simply show China rewarding its allies and ignoring its foes. This is not at all different from how the US, for example, has operated so far regarding COVID vaccine donations\u2014it's sent them to strong allies like Mexico and Canada. Although, it's quite possible that China is going beyond rewarding its key existing allies and using vaccines to try and form new ones. Brazil and the US have gotten along rather well in recent years, especially over most of the past four, as Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro is an open admirer of former US President Donald Trump. That meant that Brazil followed the US's lead in banning the Chinese telecom giant Huawei from playing a part in building out their 5G cell network infrastructure, purportedly out of security concerns. Therefore, it was a bit of a surprise when Brazilian Communications Minister Fabio Faria took a trip to Beijing in February and met with Huawei executives. According to Faria, he quote, took advantage of the trip to ask for vaccines, which is what everyone is clamoring for. Soon after, he posted a letter on Twitter from the Chinese ambassador to Brazil which noted the request, reading quote, During your visit to China, you expressed the desire to continue to strengthen cooperation between our two countries regarding COVID-19 vaccines. I'd give this matter great importance.\" A few weeks later, the Brazilian government announced the rules and structure for its 5G auction and, in a change of course, Huawei was now allowed to participate. The company, in response to questions about this, didn't even directly deny that a tit-for-tat deal took place. In a statement, they said that while they could not directly provide vaccines, they could facilitate, quote, communication in an open and transparent manner in a topic involving the two governments. While there's no direct evidence of China trading vaccines for its foreign policy goals, people are starting to pay more attention to situations like this, where countries are opening the door for such an action, and China's certainly not closing that door. While its exact details might still be murky, it is clear that China is engaging in some form of vaccine diplomacy. This, however, presents a problem. You see, one of the main advantages of mRNA vaccine technology\u2014the kind used in Moderna and Pfizer's COVID vaccines\u2014is that it's relatively easy to manufacture. Most other types of vaccines include an attenuated or dead version of the virus itself, or a portion of it, but growing and then processing the virus itself is a time-consuming process that is harder to scale. Meanwhile, mRNA vaccines simply include the genetic instructions for the body to create a harmless version of the coronavirus' spike protein, which can train the immune system to respond to it. Done right, that means that mRNA vaccine production can be faster than that of attenuated or inactivated virus, protein-based, or viral vector vaccines\u2014the technologies that China's vaccines are based on. That means that, after a slow-to-scale manufacturing process, priority order obligations to trial-hosting countries, a robust program of vaccine diplomacy, and an insistence to only use Chinese-made vaccines, that doesn't leave a whole lot of Chinese COVID vaccines for China to use for itself. As of March 2021, China has administered about five doses for every 100 citizens. That's compared to between 10 and 15 for every 100 in most EU countries, 35 for 100 in the US, and 42 for 100 in the UK. Of course, with very few COVID cases within its borders, there is less of a pressing need for vaccination in China, but the country's entire foreign image goal during the pandemic has been to be viewed as better than Europe or the US. It's to be viewed as the country that, thanks to its remarkable economic transformation over the past few decades, has caught up to Europe or the US's superpower status. At present, estimates believe that China will attain widespread vaccination towards the end of 2022\u2014roughly the same time period as India, Iran, Egypt, Ethiopia, or Colombia. By that time, assuming all goes to plan, most of the Western world will have been back to normal for at least a year as the era of border restrictions, snap lockdowns, and economic uncertainty drags on in the People's Republic. That's not the look the country wants, both at home and abroad. Now, none of this is to say that China's vaccination practices necessarily are or are not immoral or harmful or any other value judgment, but it is to say that the practices are problematic for China itself. People, both within the country's borders and beyond, are going to wonder why doses are going to foreign arms first, when Chinese citizens are still vulnerable. They're going to wonder why China didn't use its newfound wealth to purchase more effective and faster-delivering vaccines from foreign manufacturers\u2014they're going to wonder why, when life is back to normal in the West, the country that flouts itself as the conqueror of the coronavirus is still far from herd immunity. This wonder will lead to conclusions, and without the narrative control that they so desperately work to maintain, China's foreign and domestic image might, once again, suffer in what is hopefully COVID-19's third and final act.
