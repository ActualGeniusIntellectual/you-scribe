21200	24880	China has backed itself into a corner.
24880	29520	About a year ago, in spring 2020, it emerged triumphant.
30040	35260	After months of devastation, it became the first country to coax life back to near-normal
35260	38320	after a widespread COVID epidemic.
38320	42760	Just as it emerged from lockdown, the rest of the world was entering into it, so China
42760	47920	started to focus its attention on not only recovering from COVID, but also from the hit
47920	52680	it took to its global image as a result of perceived mismanagement in the virus' early
52680	53680	days.
53680	59180	As the US and Europe struggled from far larger, far more devastating outbreaks, China sat
59180	64000	on the sidelines, working on ways to be viewed not only as the country that crushed COVID
64000	68140	within its borders, but also led the fight against it around the world.
68140	72280	They wanted to be seen doing what the US and Europe couldn't while they were focused
72280	74220	on their problems at home.
74220	78180	As hospital ships docked and intensive care units ballooned in size throughout April and
78180	83440	New York, planes were landing at JFK carrying thousands of desperately needed ventilators
83440	84600	from China.
84600	89680	As hospitals around the world ran out of supplies and required healthcare workers to reuse masks
89680	95000	for days or weeks on end, national airlines were making special, dedicated trips to pick
95000	97600	up medical supplies donated by China.
97600	101520	As every corner of the world worked to ramp up testing to get a more accurate picture
101520	106760	of their problems, Chinese-made test kits were streaming through their borders.
106760	112220	China was at the center of the fight against the virus, but the center can be the riskiest
112220	113960	place to be.
113960	120160	As donations turned into purchases, it emerged that there was a major quality problem.
120160	125400	Some 90% of mask certifications from China, according to one measure, were fake, tests
125400	130900	that were supposed to have 80% sensitivity actually had 30%, and stories emerged globally
130900	135860	of Chinese officials demanding public displays of thanks in exchange for donations.
135860	142740	What was supposed to be a diplomacy coup rekindled an old narrative of Chinese-made as inferior.
142740	148100	At best, this effort did little to rewrite China's role in the pandemic, but at worst,
148100	152880	it seems very possible that it actually further damaged their global image.
152880	158200	However, while the start and the middle of the pandemic did not entirely go China's
158200	163520	way, in terms of global image, there was still the end.
163520	168200	China still had the chance to recover what they'd lost, and, more specifically, they
168200	174180	had the chance to display their homegrown scientific skill and manufacturing might.
174180	177940	China could be the country that supplies the shots that would end the world's misery
177940	180520	and put the pandemic in the history books.
180520	187540	They could make the world's vaccine, but of course, first, they needed a vaccine.
187540	190080	Luckily, they had a head start.
190080	195040	As soon as the outbreak began in China, a number of private companies, state-owned enterprises,
195040	198960	and government-run institutes started work on developing a vaccine.
198960	204980	By spring, there were some strong, viable candidates, so the next step was testing.
204980	210160	Just as most of the Western world entered their lockdowns, the first Chinese vaccine,
210160	217480	85-nCoV by CanSino Biologics, entered a phase 1 clinical trial on March 17th, 2020, with
217480	220880	108 adults in Wuhan receiving the shot.
220880	226440	Under positive data, this same vaccine became the first in the world to enter phase 2 trials
226440	229920	on April 11th, with 508 participants.
229920	234160	When the results from that trial were published on July 20th, they revealed that not only
234160	238500	was the vaccine acceptably safe, but that it was also generating the desired immune
238500	243200	response—in short, it was seemingly both safe and effective.
243200	249200	However, the next phase of clinical testing presented a problem for CanSino.
249200	254420	You see, phase 1 vaccine trials are about seeing if they're safe, and then phase 2
254420	258860	trials are about seeing if they generate the desired immune response in the body.
258860	264640	Phase 3 trials, however, that's about seeing if the vaccine works in the real world—to
264640	267640	see if it actually protects humans.
267640	273720	To do so, researchers divide the study participants into two equal-sized groups—one receives
273720	279360	the actual candidate vaccine, the other receives a placebo shot—typically just a saline
279360	280360	solution.
280360	285080	Then, the two groups are tracked to see if one is less likely to contract the virus than
285080	286080	the other.
286080	290560	The problem for CanSino, the other Chinese vaccine makers, and the country as a whole
290560	296120	was that, by late summer, when the first Chinese vaccines were moving into phase 3 trials,
296120	300640	daily COVID cases in the country had been reduced to double-digit levels in a country
300640	303480	of well over a billion.
303480	308960	Most phase 3 vaccine trials have below 50,000 participants, so it would take years, if not
308960	313640	decades, at those caseloads to get to the hundreds of infections needed in a trial to
313640	315920	prove a vaccine's efficacy.
315920	320240	Essentially, it was impossible for Chinese companies to complete their COVID vaccines
320240	325640	in China exactly because the country had done so well at suppressing the virus.
325640	329640	Therefore, they had to move abroad.
329640	336480	The CanSino AD5-NCoV vaccine started phase 3 trials in Russia, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia,
336480	340960	Mexico, Argentina, and Chile, while the other leading candidates moved to dozens of other
340960	344160	countries with more severe COVID epidemics.
344160	349920	However, with many of these, China and its pharmaceutical companies had to curry favor
349920	351680	with each government.
351680	356000	Typically, that took the form of offering priority access to the very vaccines that
356000	359480	they were testing, which was fine… for the moment.
359480	363960	As of now, five Chinese-made vaccines have been approved in the country.
363960	369000	In general, there has been widespread criticism of the country's vaccine development practices.
369000	372400	They've started vaccinating the general public before their phase 3 trials reached
372400	376640	their endpoints, they haven't been forthcoming with clinical trial data, they've misrepresented
376640	382080	efficacy ratings from trials, and more, however, despite that, there is evidence that these
382080	388360	vaccines are acceptably safe and effective—even if potentially less so than other approved
388360	389360	vaccines.
390240	396280	On December 30th, the BBIBP-CoV vaccine manufactured by Sinopharm, a Chinese state-owned enterprise,
396280	400520	was approved in the country, making it one of the first COVID vaccines in the world to
400520	403280	be deployed in the general population.
403280	406920	Despite the fact that this vaccine was developed and manufactured by a company owned by the
406920	411280	Chinese government, and despite the fact that the country had some 1.4 billion people to
411280	418080	inoculate, many of the first doses of the Sinopharm vaccine were sent beyond their borders.
418120	422920	Chinese state-owned media reports that the company has orders for its vaccine from over
422920	427260	100 countries, although the details of such orders are not publicly known, leading to
427260	430080	some skepticism over the numbers.
430080	434720	We do know details for certain orders, though, and in some cases, we might know more than
434720	436640	China wants us to.
436640	440960	In general, though, China's goal with its global vaccine distribution is essentially
440960	446320	to do what it failed to do with masks, ventilators, and tests in 2020.
446360	450960	China wants to be the country that ended other countries' epidemics.
450960	456920	Now, even though Western vaccines from Moderna and Pfizer have a 95% efficacy rating compared
456920	463380	to 50-83% in Chinese vaccines, those Western vaccines have order obligations taking up
463380	466240	their inventory well into 2022.
466240	471560	However, that's not the case with certain Chinese vaccines, so some countries are making
471560	477580	the calculation that it's better to have less effective vaccines sooner than the alternative.
477580	483040	Of course, for China, this is a major diplomacy coup.
483040	487840	Countries historically allied with the West, such as Hungary and Mexico, are turning to
487840	488840	China.
488840	493920	In their narrative, China is doing what the West cannot.
493920	497280	Of course, they want this to continue, and even ramp up.
497320	502440	That's why they've been sending their vaccines all around the world for free.
502440	507920	Mongolia and Sri Lanka received 300,000 doses of the Sinopharm vaccine, Algeria, Sierra
507920	513880	Leone, and Zimbabwe 200,000, and Belarus, Equatorial Guinea, Gabon, Mozambique, Namibia,
513880	515360	and Bolivia 100,000.
515360	520480	Now, a couple hundred thousand doses isn't going to end any of these countries' epidemics,
520480	524620	but it's enough for clips of healthcare workers receiving Chinese-made and donated
524620	527180	vaccinations to make the evening news.
527180	531340	It's also enough for each of these countries to see that these vaccines are acceptably
531340	536340	safe and effective, giving them little reason to not order more when China is offering them
536340	540140	months or years before the big Western manufacturers.
540140	546900	However, the fact that many of China's vaccines are made and distributed by state-owned enterprises
546900	552140	has led many to wonder whether the country is choosing who gets these life-saving inoculations
552140	554500	based on diplomatic intentions.
554500	560300	It's leading many to wonder whether who lives and who dies in this pandemic is starting
560300	565720	to be based on how friendly the country on a given person's passport is to the People's
565720	567180	Republic of China.
567180	570880	The answer to this question is not hard to find.
570880	574900	On the readout of the call between Chinese DIC Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi
574900	579620	and Algerian Foreign Minister Sabri Boukadoum, the Chinese official brought up Algeria's
579620	584700	vote 50 years ago to switch Chinese representation at the UN from the Republic of China government,
584700	590140	now known as Taiwan, to the People's Republic of China, which most now refer to as China.
590140	595180	In addition, the Chinese official noted Algeria's participation in China's Belt and Road Infrastructure
595180	599860	Development Initiative, before announcing the country's intention to donate 200,000
599860	602460	Sinopharm vaccine doses to Algeria.
602460	607880	Elsewhere, in South America, 10 of its 12 countries have vaccinated their populations
607880	611200	with either purchased or donated Chinese vaccines.
611200	615660	The only two exceptions are Suriname, the lowest population country on the continent,
615660	616660	and Paraguay.
616660	622160	Now, Paraguay's absence on the list of countries to have received Chinese vaccines is not tough
622160	626640	to figure out—it's because of another list that they are on.
626640	633460	Paraguay is one of just 15 countries worldwide that recognizes Taiwan as an independent nation—something
633460	636280	that undermines China's claims of the island.
636280	641320	In fact, there is zero overlap between the list of countries that recognizes Taiwan and
641320	644360	those that have received Chinese COVID vaccines.
644360	650080	However, the cases of Algeria and Paraguay simply show China rewarding its allies and
650080	652040	ignoring its foes.
652040	656880	This is not at all different from how the US, for example, has operated so far regarding
656880	661720	COVID vaccine donations—it's sent them to strong allies like Mexico and Canada.
662200	667420	Although, it's quite possible that China is going beyond rewarding its key existing
667420	673080	allies and using vaccines to try and form new ones.
673080	677400	Brazil and the US have gotten along rather well in recent years, especially over most
677400	682480	of the past four, as Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro is an open admirer of former US
682480	684280	President Donald Trump.
684280	687940	That meant that Brazil followed the US's lead in banning the Chinese telecom giant
687940	693200	Huawei from playing a part in building out their 5G cell network infrastructure, purportedly
693200	694500	out of security concerns.
694500	699680	Therefore, it was a bit of a surprise when Brazilian Communications Minister Fabio Faria
699680	704320	took a trip to Beijing in February and met with Huawei executives.
704320	708700	According to Faria, he quote, took advantage of the trip to ask for vaccines, which is
708700	711260	what everyone is clamoring for.
711260	715720	Soon after, he posted a letter on Twitter from the Chinese ambassador to Brazil which
715720	717920	noted the request, reading quote,
717920	722000	During your visit to China, you expressed the desire to continue to strengthen cooperation
722000	725360	between our two countries regarding COVID-19 vaccines.
725360	728840	I'd give this matter great importance."
728840	733400	A few weeks later, the Brazilian government announced the rules and structure for its
733400	739220	5G auction and, in a change of course, Huawei was now allowed to participate.
739220	744560	The company, in response to questions about this, didn't even directly deny that a tit-for-tat
744560	746240	deal took place.
746240	750720	In a statement, they said that while they could not directly provide vaccines, they
750720	752480	could facilitate, quote,
752480	756880	communication in an open and transparent manner in a topic involving the two governments.
756880	762680	While there's no direct evidence of China trading vaccines for its foreign policy goals,
762680	766720	people are starting to pay more attention to situations like this, where countries are
766720	772400	opening the door for such an action, and China's certainly not closing that door.
772920	778360	While its exact details might still be murky, it is clear that China is engaging in some
778360	780840	form of vaccine diplomacy.
780840	784160	This, however, presents a problem.
784160	790080	You see, one of the main advantages of mRNA vaccine technology—the kind used in Moderna
790080	795300	and Pfizer's COVID vaccines—is that it's relatively easy to manufacture.
795300	800160	Most other types of vaccines include an attenuated or dead version of the virus itself, or a
800360	805440	portion of it, but growing and then processing the virus itself is a time-consuming process
805440	807400	that is harder to scale.
807400	812280	Meanwhile, mRNA vaccines simply include the genetic instructions for the body to create
812280	816600	a harmless version of the coronavirus' spike protein, which can train the immune system
816600	817960	to respond to it.
817960	824240	Done right, that means that mRNA vaccine production can be faster than that of attenuated or inactivated
824240	829360	virus, protein-based, or viral vector vaccines—the technologies that China's vaccines are based
829360	830360	on.
830360	836680	That means that, after a slow-to-scale manufacturing process, priority order obligations to trial-hosting
836680	841800	countries, a robust program of vaccine diplomacy, and an insistence to only use Chinese-made
841800	847440	vaccines, that doesn't leave a whole lot of Chinese COVID vaccines for China to use
847440	849120	for itself.
849120	855160	As of March 2021, China has administered about five doses for every 100 citizens.
855160	861400	That's compared to between 10 and 15 for every 100 in most EU countries, 35 for 100
861400	864880	in the US, and 42 for 100 in the UK.
864880	869720	Of course, with very few COVID cases within its borders, there is less of a pressing need
869720	875480	for vaccination in China, but the country's entire foreign image goal during the pandemic
875480	879120	has been to be viewed as better than Europe or the US.
879120	884040	It's to be viewed as the country that, thanks to its remarkable economic transformation
884040	890240	over the past few decades, has caught up to Europe or the US's superpower status.
890240	894540	At present, estimates believe that China will attain widespread vaccination towards the
894540	903120	end of 2022—roughly the same time period as India, Iran, Egypt, Ethiopia, or Colombia.
903120	908020	By that time, assuming all goes to plan, most of the Western world will have been back to
908020	913940	normal for at least a year as the era of border restrictions, snap lockdowns, and economic
913940	917460	uncertainty drags on in the People's Republic.
917460	922180	That's not the look the country wants, both at home and abroad.
922180	927240	Now, none of this is to say that China's vaccination practices necessarily are or are
927240	932460	not immoral or harmful or any other value judgment, but it is to say that the practices
932460	935420	are problematic for China itself.
935420	940200	People, both within the country's borders and beyond, are going to wonder why doses
940200	944680	are going to foreign arms first, when Chinese citizens are still vulnerable.
944680	949120	They're going to wonder why China didn't use its newfound wealth to purchase more effective
949120	953040	and faster-delivering vaccines from foreign manufacturers—they're going to wonder
953040	958160	why, when life is back to normal in the West, the country that flouts itself as the conqueror
958160	962340	of the coronavirus is still far from herd immunity.
962340	966660	This wonder will lead to conclusions, and without the narrative control that they so
966660	973680	desperately work to maintain, China's foreign and domestic image might, once again, suffer
973680	979340	in what is hopefully COVID-19's third and final act.
979340	986140	So, $15 is about what it costs to get a fancy burger, a movie ticket, or a cocktail at a
986140	990900	nice bar, but it's also what it costs to get a year's worth of access to both Curiosity
