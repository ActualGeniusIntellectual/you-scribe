00:21.200 --> 00:24.880
China has backed itself into a corner.

00:24.880 --> 00:29.520
About a year ago, in spring 2020, it emerged triumphant.

00:30.040 --> 00:35.260
After months of devastation, it became the first country to coax life back to near-normal

00:35.260 --> 00:38.320
after a widespread COVID epidemic.

00:38.320 --> 00:42.760
Just as it emerged from lockdown, the rest of the world was entering into it, so China

00:42.760 --> 00:47.920
started to focus its attention on not only recovering from COVID, but also from the hit

00:47.920 --> 00:52.680
it took to its global image as a result of perceived mismanagement in the virus' early

00:52.680 --> 00:53.680
days.

00:53.680 --> 00:59.180
As the US and Europe struggled from far larger, far more devastating outbreaks, China sat

00:59.180 --> 01:04.000
on the sidelines, working on ways to be viewed not only as the country that crushed COVID

01:04.000 --> 01:08.140
within its borders, but also led the fight against it around the world.

01:08.140 --> 01:12.280
They wanted to be seen doing what the US and Europe couldn't while they were focused

01:12.280 --> 01:14.220
on their problems at home.

01:14.220 --> 01:18.180
As hospital ships docked and intensive care units ballooned in size throughout April and

01:18.180 --> 01:23.440
New York, planes were landing at JFK carrying thousands of desperately needed ventilators

01:23.440 --> 01:24.600
from China.

01:24.600 --> 01:29.680
As hospitals around the world ran out of supplies and required healthcare workers to reuse masks

01:29.680 --> 01:35.000
for days or weeks on end, national airlines were making special, dedicated trips to pick

01:35.000 --> 01:37.600
up medical supplies donated by China.

01:37.600 --> 01:41.520
As every corner of the world worked to ramp up testing to get a more accurate picture

01:41.520 --> 01:46.760
of their problems, Chinese-made test kits were streaming through their borders.

01:46.760 --> 01:52.220
China was at the center of the fight against the virus, but the center can be the riskiest

01:52.220 --> 01:53.960
place to be.

01:53.960 --> 02:00.160
As donations turned into purchases, it emerged that there was a major quality problem.

02:00.160 --> 02:05.400
Some 90% of mask certifications from China, according to one measure, were fake, tests

02:05.400 --> 02:10.900
that were supposed to have 80% sensitivity actually had 30%, and stories emerged globally

02:10.900 --> 02:15.860
of Chinese officials demanding public displays of thanks in exchange for donations.

02:15.860 --> 02:22.740
What was supposed to be a diplomacy coup rekindled an old narrative of Chinese-made as inferior.

02:22.740 --> 02:28.100
At best, this effort did little to rewrite China's role in the pandemic, but at worst,

02:28.100 --> 02:32.880
it seems very possible that it actually further damaged their global image.

02:32.880 --> 02:38.200
However, while the start and the middle of the pandemic did not entirely go China's

02:38.200 --> 02:43.520
way, in terms of global image, there was still the end.

02:43.520 --> 02:48.200
China still had the chance to recover what they'd lost, and, more specifically, they

02:48.200 --> 02:54.180
had the chance to display their homegrown scientific skill and manufacturing might.

02:54.180 --> 02:57.940
China could be the country that supplies the shots that would end the world's misery

02:57.940 --> 03:00.520
and put the pandemic in the history books.

03:00.520 --> 03:07.540
They could make the world's vaccine, but of course, first, they needed a vaccine.

03:07.540 --> 03:10.080
Luckily, they had a head start.

03:10.080 --> 03:15.040
As soon as the outbreak began in China, a number of private companies, state-owned enterprises,

03:15.040 --> 03:18.960
and government-run institutes started work on developing a vaccine.

03:18.960 --> 03:24.980
By spring, there were some strong, viable candidates, so the next step was testing.

03:24.980 --> 03:30.160
Just as most of the Western world entered their lockdowns, the first Chinese vaccine,

03:30.160 --> 03:37.480
85-nCoV by CanSino Biologics, entered a phase 1 clinical trial on March 17th, 2020, with

03:37.480 --> 03:40.880
108 adults in Wuhan receiving the shot.

03:40.880 --> 03:46.440
Under positive data, this same vaccine became the first in the world to enter phase 2 trials

03:46.440 --> 03:49.920
on April 11th, with 508 participants.

03:49.920 --> 03:54.160
When the results from that trial were published on July 20th, they revealed that not only

03:54.160 --> 03:58.500
was the vaccine acceptably safe, but that it was also generating the desired immune

03:58.500 --> 04:03.200
response—in short, it was seemingly both safe and effective.

04:03.200 --> 04:09.200
However, the next phase of clinical testing presented a problem for CanSino.

04:09.200 --> 04:14.420
You see, phase 1 vaccine trials are about seeing if they're safe, and then phase 2

04:14.420 --> 04:18.860
trials are about seeing if they generate the desired immune response in the body.

04:18.860 --> 04:24.640
Phase 3 trials, however, that's about seeing if the vaccine works in the real world—to

04:24.640 --> 04:27.640
see if it actually protects humans.

04:27.640 --> 04:33.720
To do so, researchers divide the study participants into two equal-sized groups—one receives

04:33.720 --> 04:39.360
the actual candidate vaccine, the other receives a placebo shot—typically just a saline

04:39.360 --> 04:40.360
solution.

04:40.360 --> 04:45.080
Then, the two groups are tracked to see if one is less likely to contract the virus than

04:45.080 --> 04:46.080
the other.

04:46.080 --> 04:50.560
The problem for CanSino, the other Chinese vaccine makers, and the country as a whole

04:50.560 --> 04:56.120
was that, by late summer, when the first Chinese vaccines were moving into phase 3 trials,

04:56.120 --> 05:00.640
daily COVID cases in the country had been reduced to double-digit levels in a country

05:00.640 --> 05:03.480
of well over a billion.

05:03.480 --> 05:08.960
Most phase 3 vaccine trials have below 50,000 participants, so it would take years, if not

05:08.960 --> 05:13.640
decades, at those caseloads to get to the hundreds of infections needed in a trial to

05:13.640 --> 05:15.920
prove a vaccine's efficacy.

05:15.920 --> 05:20.240
Essentially, it was impossible for Chinese companies to complete their COVID vaccines

05:20.240 --> 05:25.640
in China exactly because the country had done so well at suppressing the virus.

05:25.640 --> 05:29.640
Therefore, they had to move abroad.

05:29.640 --> 05:36.480
The CanSino AD5-NCoV vaccine started phase 3 trials in Russia, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia,

05:36.480 --> 05:40.960
Mexico, Argentina, and Chile, while the other leading candidates moved to dozens of other

05:40.960 --> 05:44.160
countries with more severe COVID epidemics.

05:44.160 --> 05:49.920
However, with many of these, China and its pharmaceutical companies had to curry favor

05:49.920 --> 05:51.680
with each government.

05:51.680 --> 05:56.000
Typically, that took the form of offering priority access to the very vaccines that

05:56.000 --> 05:59.480
they were testing, which was fine… for the moment.

05:59.480 --> 06:03.960
As of now, five Chinese-made vaccines have been approved in the country.

06:03.960 --> 06:09.000
In general, there has been widespread criticism of the country's vaccine development practices.

06:09.000 --> 06:12.400
They've started vaccinating the general public before their phase 3 trials reached

06:12.400 --> 06:16.640
their endpoints, they haven't been forthcoming with clinical trial data, they've misrepresented

06:16.640 --> 06:22.080
efficacy ratings from trials, and more, however, despite that, there is evidence that these

06:22.080 --> 06:28.360
vaccines are acceptably safe and effective—even if potentially less so than other approved

06:28.360 --> 06:29.360
vaccines.

06:30.240 --> 06:36.280
On December 30th, the BBIBP-CoV vaccine manufactured by Sinopharm, a Chinese state-owned enterprise,

06:36.280 --> 06:40.520
was approved in the country, making it one of the first COVID vaccines in the world to

06:40.520 --> 06:43.280
be deployed in the general population.

06:43.280 --> 06:46.920
Despite the fact that this vaccine was developed and manufactured by a company owned by the

06:46.920 --> 06:51.280
Chinese government, and despite the fact that the country had some 1.4 billion people to

06:51.280 --> 06:58.080
inoculate, many of the first doses of the Sinopharm vaccine were sent beyond their borders.

06:58.120 --> 07:02.920
Chinese state-owned media reports that the company has orders for its vaccine from over

07:02.920 --> 07:07.260
100 countries, although the details of such orders are not publicly known, leading to

07:07.260 --> 07:10.080
some skepticism over the numbers.

07:10.080 --> 07:14.720
We do know details for certain orders, though, and in some cases, we might know more than

07:14.720 --> 07:16.640
China wants us to.

07:16.640 --> 07:20.960
In general, though, China's goal with its global vaccine distribution is essentially

07:20.960 --> 07:26.320
to do what it failed to do with masks, ventilators, and tests in 2020.

07:26.360 --> 07:30.960
China wants to be the country that ended other countries' epidemics.

07:30.960 --> 07:36.920
Now, even though Western vaccines from Moderna and Pfizer have a 95% efficacy rating compared

07:36.920 --> 07:43.380
to 50-83% in Chinese vaccines, those Western vaccines have order obligations taking up

07:43.380 --> 07:46.240
their inventory well into 2022.

07:46.240 --> 07:51.560
However, that's not the case with certain Chinese vaccines, so some countries are making

07:51.560 --> 07:57.580
the calculation that it's better to have less effective vaccines sooner than the alternative.

07:57.580 --> 08:03.040
Of course, for China, this is a major diplomacy coup.

08:03.040 --> 08:07.840
Countries historically allied with the West, such as Hungary and Mexico, are turning to

08:07.840 --> 08:08.840
China.

08:08.840 --> 08:13.920
In their narrative, China is doing what the West cannot.

08:13.920 --> 08:17.280
Of course, they want this to continue, and even ramp up.

08:17.320 --> 08:22.440
That's why they've been sending their vaccines all around the world for free.

08:22.440 --> 08:27.920
Mongolia and Sri Lanka received 300,000 doses of the Sinopharm vaccine, Algeria, Sierra

08:27.920 --> 08:33.880
Leone, and Zimbabwe 200,000, and Belarus, Equatorial Guinea, Gabon, Mozambique, Namibia,

08:33.880 --> 08:35.360
and Bolivia 100,000.

08:35.360 --> 08:40.480
Now, a couple hundred thousand doses isn't going to end any of these countries' epidemics,

08:40.480 --> 08:44.620
but it's enough for clips of healthcare workers receiving Chinese-made and donated

08:44.620 --> 08:47.180
vaccinations to make the evening news.

08:47.180 --> 08:51.340
It's also enough for each of these countries to see that these vaccines are acceptably

08:51.340 --> 08:56.340
safe and effective, giving them little reason to not order more when China is offering them

08:56.340 --> 09:00.140
months or years before the big Western manufacturers.

09:00.140 --> 09:06.900
However, the fact that many of China's vaccines are made and distributed by state-owned enterprises

09:06.900 --> 09:12.140
has led many to wonder whether the country is choosing who gets these life-saving inoculations

09:12.140 --> 09:14.500
based on diplomatic intentions.

09:14.500 --> 09:20.300
It's leading many to wonder whether who lives and who dies in this pandemic is starting

09:20.300 --> 09:25.720
to be based on how friendly the country on a given person's passport is to the People's

09:25.720 --> 09:27.180
Republic of China.

09:27.180 --> 09:30.880
The answer to this question is not hard to find.

09:30.880 --> 09:34.900
On the readout of the call between Chinese DIC Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi

09:34.900 --> 09:39.620
and Algerian Foreign Minister Sabri Boukadoum, the Chinese official brought up Algeria's

09:39.620 --> 09:44.700
vote 50 years ago to switch Chinese representation at the UN from the Republic of China government,

09:44.700 --> 09:50.140
now known as Taiwan, to the People's Republic of China, which most now refer to as China.

09:50.140 --> 09:55.180
In addition, the Chinese official noted Algeria's participation in China's Belt and Road Infrastructure

09:55.180 --> 09:59.860
Development Initiative, before announcing the country's intention to donate 200,000

09:59.860 --> 10:02.460
Sinopharm vaccine doses to Algeria.

10:02.460 --> 10:07.880
Elsewhere, in South America, 10 of its 12 countries have vaccinated their populations

10:07.880 --> 10:11.200
with either purchased or donated Chinese vaccines.

10:11.200 --> 10:15.660
The only two exceptions are Suriname, the lowest population country on the continent,

10:15.660 --> 10:16.660
and Paraguay.

10:16.660 --> 10:22.160
Now, Paraguay's absence on the list of countries to have received Chinese vaccines is not tough

10:22.160 --> 10:26.640
to figure out—it's because of another list that they are on.

10:26.640 --> 10:33.460
Paraguay is one of just 15 countries worldwide that recognizes Taiwan as an independent nation—something

10:33.460 --> 10:36.280
that undermines China's claims of the island.

10:36.280 --> 10:41.320
In fact, there is zero overlap between the list of countries that recognizes Taiwan and

10:41.320 --> 10:44.360
those that have received Chinese COVID vaccines.

10:44.360 --> 10:50.080
However, the cases of Algeria and Paraguay simply show China rewarding its allies and

10:50.080 --> 10:52.040
ignoring its foes.

10:52.040 --> 10:56.880
This is not at all different from how the US, for example, has operated so far regarding

10:56.880 --> 11:01.720
COVID vaccine donations—it's sent them to strong allies like Mexico and Canada.

11:02.200 --> 11:07.420
Although, it's quite possible that China is going beyond rewarding its key existing

11:07.420 --> 11:13.080
allies and using vaccines to try and form new ones.

11:13.080 --> 11:17.400
Brazil and the US have gotten along rather well in recent years, especially over most

11:17.400 --> 11:22.480
of the past four, as Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro is an open admirer of former US

11:22.480 --> 11:24.280
President Donald Trump.

11:24.280 --> 11:27.940
That meant that Brazil followed the US's lead in banning the Chinese telecom giant

11:27.940 --> 11:33.200
Huawei from playing a part in building out their 5G cell network infrastructure, purportedly

11:33.200 --> 11:34.500
out of security concerns.

11:34.500 --> 11:39.680
Therefore, it was a bit of a surprise when Brazilian Communications Minister Fabio Faria

11:39.680 --> 11:44.320
took a trip to Beijing in February and met with Huawei executives.

11:44.320 --> 11:48.700
According to Faria, he quote, took advantage of the trip to ask for vaccines, which is

11:48.700 --> 11:51.260
what everyone is clamoring for.

11:51.260 --> 11:55.720
Soon after, he posted a letter on Twitter from the Chinese ambassador to Brazil which

11:55.720 --> 11:57.920
noted the request, reading quote,

11:57.920 --> 12:02.000
During your visit to China, you expressed the desire to continue to strengthen cooperation

12:02.000 --> 12:05.360
between our two countries regarding COVID-19 vaccines.

12:05.360 --> 12:08.840
I'd give this matter great importance."

12:08.840 --> 12:13.400
A few weeks later, the Brazilian government announced the rules and structure for its

12:13.400 --> 12:19.220
5G auction and, in a change of course, Huawei was now allowed to participate.

12:19.220 --> 12:24.560
The company, in response to questions about this, didn't even directly deny that a tit-for-tat

12:24.560 --> 12:26.240
deal took place.

12:26.240 --> 12:30.720
In a statement, they said that while they could not directly provide vaccines, they

12:30.720 --> 12:32.480
could facilitate, quote,

12:32.480 --> 12:36.880
communication in an open and transparent manner in a topic involving the two governments.

12:36.880 --> 12:42.680
While there's no direct evidence of China trading vaccines for its foreign policy goals,

12:42.680 --> 12:46.720
people are starting to pay more attention to situations like this, where countries are

12:46.720 --> 12:52.400
opening the door for such an action, and China's certainly not closing that door.

12:52.920 --> 12:58.360
While its exact details might still be murky, it is clear that China is engaging in some

12:58.360 --> 13:00.840
form of vaccine diplomacy.

13:00.840 --> 13:04.160
This, however, presents a problem.

13:04.160 --> 13:10.080
You see, one of the main advantages of mRNA vaccine technology—the kind used in Moderna

13:10.080 --> 13:15.300
and Pfizer's COVID vaccines—is that it's relatively easy to manufacture.

13:15.300 --> 13:20.160
Most other types of vaccines include an attenuated or dead version of the virus itself, or a

13:20.360 --> 13:25.440
portion of it, but growing and then processing the virus itself is a time-consuming process

13:25.440 --> 13:27.400
that is harder to scale.

13:27.400 --> 13:32.280
Meanwhile, mRNA vaccines simply include the genetic instructions for the body to create

13:32.280 --> 13:36.600
a harmless version of the coronavirus' spike protein, which can train the immune system

13:36.600 --> 13:37.960
to respond to it.

13:37.960 --> 13:44.240
Done right, that means that mRNA vaccine production can be faster than that of attenuated or inactivated

13:44.240 --> 13:49.360
virus, protein-based, or viral vector vaccines—the technologies that China's vaccines are based

13:49.360 --> 13:50.360
on.

13:50.360 --> 13:56.680
That means that, after a slow-to-scale manufacturing process, priority order obligations to trial-hosting

13:56.680 --> 14:01.800
countries, a robust program of vaccine diplomacy, and an insistence to only use Chinese-made

14:01.800 --> 14:07.440
vaccines, that doesn't leave a whole lot of Chinese COVID vaccines for China to use

14:07.440 --> 14:09.120
for itself.

14:09.120 --> 14:15.160
As of March 2021, China has administered about five doses for every 100 citizens.

14:15.160 --> 14:21.400
That's compared to between 10 and 15 for every 100 in most EU countries, 35 for 100

14:21.400 --> 14:24.880
in the US, and 42 for 100 in the UK.

14:24.880 --> 14:29.720
Of course, with very few COVID cases within its borders, there is less of a pressing need

14:29.720 --> 14:35.480
for vaccination in China, but the country's entire foreign image goal during the pandemic

14:35.480 --> 14:39.120
has been to be viewed as better than Europe or the US.

14:39.120 --> 14:44.040
It's to be viewed as the country that, thanks to its remarkable economic transformation

14:44.040 --> 14:50.240
over the past few decades, has caught up to Europe or the US's superpower status.

14:50.240 --> 14:54.540
At present, estimates believe that China will attain widespread vaccination towards the

14:54.540 --> 15:03.120
end of 2022—roughly the same time period as India, Iran, Egypt, Ethiopia, or Colombia.

15:03.120 --> 15:08.020
By that time, assuming all goes to plan, most of the Western world will have been back to

15:08.020 --> 15:13.940
normal for at least a year as the era of border restrictions, snap lockdowns, and economic

15:13.940 --> 15:17.460
uncertainty drags on in the People's Republic.

15:17.460 --> 15:22.180
That's not the look the country wants, both at home and abroad.

15:22.180 --> 15:27.240
Now, none of this is to say that China's vaccination practices necessarily are or are

15:27.240 --> 15:32.460
not immoral or harmful or any other value judgment, but it is to say that the practices

15:32.460 --> 15:35.420
are problematic for China itself.

15:35.420 --> 15:40.200
People, both within the country's borders and beyond, are going to wonder why doses

15:40.200 --> 15:44.680
are going to foreign arms first, when Chinese citizens are still vulnerable.

15:44.680 --> 15:49.120
They're going to wonder why China didn't use its newfound wealth to purchase more effective

15:49.120 --> 15:53.040
and faster-delivering vaccines from foreign manufacturers—they're going to wonder

15:53.040 --> 15:58.160
why, when life is back to normal in the West, the country that flouts itself as the conqueror

15:58.160 --> 16:02.340
of the coronavirus is still far from herd immunity.

16:02.340 --> 16:06.660
This wonder will lead to conclusions, and without the narrative control that they so

16:06.660 --> 16:13.680
desperately work to maintain, China's foreign and domestic image might, once again, suffer

16:13.680 --> 16:19.340
in what is hopefully COVID-19's third and final act.

16:19.340 --> 16:26.140
So, $15 is about what it costs to get a fancy burger, a movie ticket, or a cocktail at a

16:26.140 --> 16:30.900
nice bar, but it's also what it costs to get a year's worth of access to both Curiosity

16:30.900 --> 16:37.040
Stream and Nebula with the current sale going on at CuriosityStream.com slash Wendover.

16:37.040 --> 16:41.920
With that, you can watch any one of the thousands of top-quality documentaries or non-fiction

16:41.920 --> 16:46.480
shows on Curiosity Stream, such as Hot Roads, which is about five of the world's most

16:46.480 --> 16:49.200
dangerous roads and who uses them.

16:49.200 --> 16:54.120
You could also watch all Wendover and HAI videos early and ad-free, and about once a

16:54.120 --> 16:58.700
month, like with this video, we publish extended cuts to our normal videos with everything

16:58.700 --> 17:01.000
we had to cut for time on YouTube.

17:01.000 --> 17:05.460
In addition, Nebula gives us the funding to make bigger budget and more unique content

17:05.460 --> 17:10.000
that just wouldn't work on YouTube, which we call Nebula Originals, and very soon, we're

17:10.000 --> 17:14.720
going to release a brilliant new one—the first documentary filmed on location that

17:14.720 --> 17:17.500
we'll have released in almost a year.

17:17.500 --> 17:22.600
Rather unbelievably, all of this can be had for just $15 a year, with the current sale,

17:22.600 --> 17:26.720
only if you go to CuriosityStream.com slash Wendover.

17:26.740 --> 17:31.620
Even better, that $15 goes to help independent creators like us stay independent, and helps

17:31.620 --> 17:37.220
fund the great Nebula Originals from us and others that many of you have come to enjoy.

17:37.220 --> 17:42.080
So, head to CuriosityStream.com slash Wendover and get the bundle deal at its current sale

17:42.080 --> 17:44.700
price of just $15 a year.
