6
00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:24,880
China has backed itself into a corner.

7
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:29,520
About a year ago, in spring 2020, it emerged triumphant.

8
00:00:30,040 --> 00:00:35,260
After months of devastation, it became the first country to coax life back to near-normal

9
00:00:35,260 --> 00:00:38,320
after a widespread COVID epidemic.

10
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:42,760
Just as it emerged from lockdown, the rest of the world was entering into it, so China

11
00:00:42,760 --> 00:00:47,920
started to focus its attention on not only recovering from COVID, but also from the hit

12
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:52,680
it took to its global image as a result of perceived mismanagement in the virus' early

13
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:53,680
days.

14
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:59,180
As the US and Europe struggled from far larger, far more devastating outbreaks, China sat

15
00:00:59,180 --> 00:01:04,000
on the sidelines, working on ways to be viewed not only as the country that crushed COVID

16
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,140
within its borders, but also led the fight against it around the world.

17
00:01:08,140 --> 00:01:12,280
They wanted to be seen doing what the US and Europe couldn't while they were focused

18
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:14,220
on their problems at home.

19
00:01:14,220 --> 00:01:18,180
As hospital ships docked and intensive care units ballooned in size throughout April and

20
00:01:18,180 --> 00:01:23,440
New York, planes were landing at JFK carrying thousands of desperately needed ventilators

21
00:01:23,440 --> 00:01:24,600
from China.

22
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:29,680
As hospitals around the world ran out of supplies and required healthcare workers to reuse masks

23
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:35,000
for days or weeks on end, national airlines were making special, dedicated trips to pick

24
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,600
up medical supplies donated by China.

25
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:41,520
As every corner of the world worked to ramp up testing to get a more accurate picture

26
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:46,760
of their problems, Chinese-made test kits were streaming through their borders.

27
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:52,220
China was at the center of the fight against the virus, but the center can be the riskiest

28
00:01:52,220 --> 00:01:53,960
place to be.

29
00:01:53,960 --> 00:02:00,160
As donations turned into purchases, it emerged that there was a major quality problem.

30
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:05,400
Some 90% of mask certifications from China, according to one measure, were fake, tests

31
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:10,900
that were supposed to have 80% sensitivity actually had 30%, and stories emerged globally

32
00:02:10,900 --> 00:02:15,860
of Chinese officials demanding public displays of thanks in exchange for donations.

33
00:02:15,860 --> 00:02:22,740
What was supposed to be a diplomacy coup rekindled an old narrative of Chinese-made as inferior.

34
00:02:22,740 --> 00:02:28,100
At best, this effort did little to rewrite China's role in the pandemic, but at worst,

35
00:02:28,100 --> 00:02:32,880
it seems very possible that it actually further damaged their global image.

36
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:38,200
However, while the start and the middle of the pandemic did not entirely go China's

37
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:43,520
way, in terms of global image, there was still the end.

38
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:48,200
China still had the chance to recover what they'd lost, and, more specifically, they

39
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:54,180
had the chance to display their homegrown scientific skill and manufacturing might.

40
00:02:54,180 --> 00:02:57,940
China could be the country that supplies the shots that would end the world's misery

41
00:02:57,940 --> 00:03:00,520
and put the pandemic in the history books.

42
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:07,540
They could make the world's vaccine, but of course, first, they needed a vaccine.

43
00:03:07,540 --> 00:03:10,080
Luckily, they had a head start.

44
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:15,040
As soon as the outbreak began in China, a number of private companies, state-owned enterprises,

45
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:18,960
and government-run institutes started work on developing a vaccine.

46
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:24,980
By spring, there were some strong, viable candidates, so the next step was testing.

47
00:03:24,980 --> 00:03:30,160
Just as most of the Western world entered their lockdowns, the first Chinese vaccine,

48
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:37,480
85-nCoV by CanSino Biologics, entered a phase 1 clinical trial on March 17th, 2020, with

49
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:40,880
108 adults in Wuhan receiving the shot.

50
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:46,440
Under positive data, this same vaccine became the first in the world to enter phase 2 trials

51
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:49,920
on April 11th, with 508 participants.

52
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:54,160
When the results from that trial were published on July 20th, they revealed that not only

53
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:58,500
was the vaccine acceptably safe, but that it was also generating the desired immune

54
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:03,200
response—in short, it was seemingly both safe and effective.

55
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:09,200
However, the next phase of clinical testing presented a problem for CanSino.

56
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:14,420
You see, phase 1 vaccine trials are about seeing if they're safe, and then phase 2

57
00:04:14,420 --> 00:04:18,860
trials are about seeing if they generate the desired immune response in the body.

58
00:04:18,860 --> 00:04:24,640
Phase 3 trials, however, that's about seeing if the vaccine works in the real world—to

59
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:27,640
see if it actually protects humans.

60
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:33,720
To do so, researchers divide the study participants into two equal-sized groups—one receives

61
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:39,360
the actual candidate vaccine, the other receives a placebo shot—typically just a saline

62
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:40,360
solution.

63
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:45,080
Then, the two groups are tracked to see if one is less likely to contract the virus than

64
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:46,080
the other.

65
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:50,560
The problem for CanSino, the other Chinese vaccine makers, and the country as a whole

66
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:56,120
was that, by late summer, when the first Chinese vaccines were moving into phase 3 trials,

67
00:04:56,120 --> 00:05:00,640
daily COVID cases in the country had been reduced to double-digit levels in a country

68
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:03,480
of well over a billion.

69
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:08,960
Most phase 3 vaccine trials have below 50,000 participants, so it would take years, if not

70
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:13,640
decades, at those caseloads to get to the hundreds of infections needed in a trial to

71
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:15,920
prove a vaccine's efficacy.

72
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:20,240
Essentially, it was impossible for Chinese companies to complete their COVID vaccines

73
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:25,640
in China exactly because the country had done so well at suppressing the virus.

74
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:29,640
Therefore, they had to move abroad.

75
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:36,480
The CanSino AD5-NCoV vaccine started phase 3 trials in Russia, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia,

76
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:40,960
Mexico, Argentina, and Chile, while the other leading candidates moved to dozens of other

77
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:44,160
countries with more severe COVID epidemics.

78
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:49,920
However, with many of these, China and its pharmaceutical companies had to curry favor

79
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:51,680
with each government.

80
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:56,000
Typically, that took the form of offering priority access to the very vaccines that

81
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:59,480
they were testing, which was fine… for the moment.

82
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:03,960
As of now, five Chinese-made vaccines have been approved in the country.

83
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:09,000
In general, there has been widespread criticism of the country's vaccine development practices.

84
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:12,400
They've started vaccinating the general public before their phase 3 trials reached

85
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:16,640
their endpoints, they haven't been forthcoming with clinical trial data, they've misrepresented

86
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:22,080
efficacy ratings from trials, and more, however, despite that, there is evidence that these

87
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:28,360
vaccines are acceptably safe and effective—even if potentially less so than other approved

88
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:29,360
vaccines.

89
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:36,280
On December 30th, the BBIBP-CoV vaccine manufactured by Sinopharm, a Chinese state-owned enterprise,

90
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:40,520
was approved in the country, making it one of the first COVID vaccines in the world to

91
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:43,280
be deployed in the general population.

92
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:46,920
Despite the fact that this vaccine was developed and manufactured by a company owned by the

93
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:51,280
Chinese government, and despite the fact that the country had some 1.4 billion people to

94
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:58,080
inoculate, many of the first doses of the Sinopharm vaccine were sent beyond their borders.

95
00:06:58,120 --> 00:07:02,920
Chinese state-owned media reports that the company has orders for its vaccine from over

96
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:07,260
100 countries, although the details of such orders are not publicly known, leading to

97
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:10,080
some skepticism over the numbers.

98
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:14,720
We do know details for certain orders, though, and in some cases, we might know more than

99
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:16,640
China wants us to.

100
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:20,960
In general, though, China's goal with its global vaccine distribution is essentially

101
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:26,320
to do what it failed to do with masks, ventilators, and tests in 2020.

102
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:30,960
China wants to be the country that ended other countries' epidemics.

103
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:36,920
Now, even though Western vaccines from Moderna and Pfizer have a 95% efficacy rating compared

104
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:43,380
to 50-83% in Chinese vaccines, those Western vaccines have order obligations taking up

105
00:07:43,380 --> 00:07:46,240
their inventory well into 2022.

106
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:51,560
However, that's not the case with certain Chinese vaccines, so some countries are making

107
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:57,580
the calculation that it's better to have less effective vaccines sooner than the alternative.

108
00:07:57,580 --> 00:08:03,040
Of course, for China, this is a major diplomacy coup.

109
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:07,840
Countries historically allied with the West, such as Hungary and Mexico, are turning to

110
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:08,840
China.

111
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:13,920
In their narrative, China is doing what the West cannot.

112
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:17,280
Of course, they want this to continue, and even ramp up.

113
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:22,440
That's why they've been sending their vaccines all around the world for free.

114
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:27,920
Mongolia and Sri Lanka received 300,000 doses of the Sinopharm vaccine, Algeria, Sierra

115
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:33,880
Leone, and Zimbabwe 200,000, and Belarus, Equatorial Guinea, Gabon, Mozambique, Namibia,

116
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:35,360
and Bolivia 100,000.

117
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:40,480
Now, a couple hundred thousand doses isn't going to end any of these countries' epidemics,

118
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:44,620
but it's enough for clips of healthcare workers receiving Chinese-made and donated

119
00:08:44,620 --> 00:08:47,180
vaccinations to make the evening news.

120
00:08:47,180 --> 00:08:51,340
It's also enough for each of these countries to see that these vaccines are acceptably

121
00:08:51,340 --> 00:08:56,340
safe and effective, giving them little reason to not order more when China is offering them

122
00:08:56,340 --> 00:09:00,140
months or years before the big Western manufacturers.

123
00:09:00,140 --> 00:09:06,900
However, the fact that many of China's vaccines are made and distributed by state-owned enterprises

124
00:09:06,900 --> 00:09:12,140
has led many to wonder whether the country is choosing who gets these life-saving inoculations

125
00:09:12,140 --> 00:09:14,500
based on diplomatic intentions.

126
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:20,300
It's leading many to wonder whether who lives and who dies in this pandemic is starting

127
00:09:20,300 --> 00:09:25,720
to be based on how friendly the country on a given person's passport is to the People's

128
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:27,180
Republic of China.

129
00:09:27,180 --> 00:09:30,880
The answer to this question is not hard to find.

130
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:34,900
On the readout of the call between Chinese DIC Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi

131
00:09:34,900 --> 00:09:39,620
and Algerian Foreign Minister Sabri Boukadoum, the Chinese official brought up Algeria's

132
00:09:39,620 --> 00:09:44,700
vote 50 years ago to switch Chinese representation at the UN from the Republic of China government,

133
00:09:44,700 --> 00:09:50,140
now known as Taiwan, to the People's Republic of China, which most now refer to as China.

134
00:09:50,140 --> 00:09:55,180
In addition, the Chinese official noted Algeria's participation in China's Belt and Road Infrastructure

135
00:09:55,180 --> 00:09:59,860
Development Initiative, before announcing the country's intention to donate 200,000

136
00:09:59,860 --> 00:10:02,460
Sinopharm vaccine doses to Algeria.

137
00:10:02,460 --> 00:10:07,880
Elsewhere, in South America, 10 of its 12 countries have vaccinated their populations

138
00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:11,200
with either purchased or donated Chinese vaccines.

139
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:15,660
The only two exceptions are Suriname, the lowest population country on the continent,

140
00:10:15,660 --> 00:10:16,660
and Paraguay.

141
00:10:16,660 --> 00:10:22,160
Now, Paraguay's absence on the list of countries to have received Chinese vaccines is not tough

142
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:26,640
to figure out—it's because of another list that they are on.

143
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:33,460
Paraguay is one of just 15 countries worldwide that recognizes Taiwan as an independent nation—something

144
00:10:33,460 --> 00:10:36,280
that undermines China's claims of the island.

145
00:10:36,280 --> 00:10:41,320
In fact, there is zero overlap between the list of countries that recognizes Taiwan and

146
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:44,360
those that have received Chinese COVID vaccines.

147
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:50,080
However, the cases of Algeria and Paraguay simply show China rewarding its allies and

148
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:52,040
ignoring its foes.

149
00:10:52,040 --> 00:10:56,880
This is not at all different from how the US, for example, has operated so far regarding

150
00:10:56,880 --> 00:11:01,720
COVID vaccine donations—it's sent them to strong allies like Mexico and Canada.

151
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:07,420
Although, it's quite possible that China is going beyond rewarding its key existing

152
00:11:07,420 --> 00:11:13,080
allies and using vaccines to try and form new ones.

153
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:17,400
Brazil and the US have gotten along rather well in recent years, especially over most

154
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:22,480
of the past four, as Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro is an open admirer of former US

155
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:24,280
President Donald Trump.

156
00:11:24,280 --> 00:11:27,940
That meant that Brazil followed the US's lead in banning the Chinese telecom giant

157
00:11:27,940 --> 00:11:33,200
Huawei from playing a part in building out their 5G cell network infrastructure, purportedly

158
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:34,500
out of security concerns.

159
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:39,680
Therefore, it was a bit of a surprise when Brazilian Communications Minister Fabio Faria

160
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:44,320
took a trip to Beijing in February and met with Huawei executives.

161
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:48,700
According to Faria, he quote, took advantage of the trip to ask for vaccines, which is

162
00:11:48,700 --> 00:11:51,260
what everyone is clamoring for.

163
00:11:51,260 --> 00:11:55,720
Soon after, he posted a letter on Twitter from the Chinese ambassador to Brazil which

164
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:57,920
noted the request, reading quote,

165
00:11:57,920 --> 00:12:02,000
During your visit to China, you expressed the desire to continue to strengthen cooperation

166
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:05,360
between our two countries regarding COVID-19 vaccines.

167
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:08,840
I'd give this matter great importance."

168
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:13,400
A few weeks later, the Brazilian government announced the rules and structure for its

169
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:19,220
5G auction and, in a change of course, Huawei was now allowed to participate.

170
00:12:19,220 --> 00:12:24,560
The company, in response to questions about this, didn't even directly deny that a tit-for-tat

171
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:26,240
deal took place.

172
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:30,720
In a statement, they said that while they could not directly provide vaccines, they

173
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:32,480
could facilitate, quote,

174
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:36,880
communication in an open and transparent manner in a topic involving the two governments.

175
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:42,680
While there's no direct evidence of China trading vaccines for its foreign policy goals,

176
00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:46,720
people are starting to pay more attention to situations like this, where countries are

177
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:52,400
opening the door for such an action, and China's certainly not closing that door.

178
00:12:52,920 --> 00:12:58,360
While its exact details might still be murky, it is clear that China is engaging in some

179
00:12:58,360 --> 00:13:00,840
form of vaccine diplomacy.

180
00:13:00,840 --> 00:13:04,160
This, however, presents a problem.

181
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:10,080
You see, one of the main advantages of mRNA vaccine technology—the kind used in Moderna

182
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:15,300
and Pfizer's COVID vaccines—is that it's relatively easy to manufacture.

183
00:13:15,300 --> 00:13:20,160
Most other types of vaccines include an attenuated or dead version of the virus itself, or a

184
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:25,440
portion of it, but growing and then processing the virus itself is a time-consuming process

185
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:27,400
that is harder to scale.

186
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:32,280
Meanwhile, mRNA vaccines simply include the genetic instructions for the body to create

187
00:13:32,280 --> 00:13:36,600
a harmless version of the coronavirus' spike protein, which can train the immune system

188
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:37,960
to respond to it.

189
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:44,240
Done right, that means that mRNA vaccine production can be faster than that of attenuated or inactivated

190
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:49,360
virus, protein-based, or viral vector vaccines—the technologies that China's vaccines are based

191
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:50,360
on.

192
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:56,680
That means that, after a slow-to-scale manufacturing process, priority order obligations to trial-hosting

193
00:13:56,680 --> 00:14:01,800
countries, a robust program of vaccine diplomacy, and an insistence to only use Chinese-made

194
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:07,440
vaccines, that doesn't leave a whole lot of Chinese COVID vaccines for China to use

195
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:09,120
for itself.

196
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:15,160
As of March 2021, China has administered about five doses for every 100 citizens.

197
00:14:15,160 --> 00:14:21,400
That's compared to between 10 and 15 for every 100 in most EU countries, 35 for 100

198
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:24,880
in the US, and 42 for 100 in the UK.

199
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:29,720
Of course, with very few COVID cases within its borders, there is less of a pressing need

200
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:35,480
for vaccination in China, but the country's entire foreign image goal during the pandemic

201
00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:39,120
has been to be viewed as better than Europe or the US.

202
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:44,040
It's to be viewed as the country that, thanks to its remarkable economic transformation

203
00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:50,240
over the past few decades, has caught up to Europe or the US's superpower status.

204
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:54,540
At present, estimates believe that China will attain widespread vaccination towards the

205
00:14:54,540 --> 00:15:03,120
end of 2022—roughly the same time period as India, Iran, Egypt, Ethiopia, or Colombia.

206
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:08,020
By that time, assuming all goes to plan, most of the Western world will have been back to

207
00:15:08,020 --> 00:15:13,940
normal for at least a year as the era of border restrictions, snap lockdowns, and economic

208
00:15:13,940 --> 00:15:17,460
uncertainty drags on in the People's Republic.

209
00:15:17,460 --> 00:15:22,180
That's not the look the country wants, both at home and abroad.

210
00:15:22,180 --> 00:15:27,240
Now, none of this is to say that China's vaccination practices necessarily are or are

211
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:32,460
not immoral or harmful or any other value judgment, but it is to say that the practices

212
00:15:32,460 --> 00:15:35,420
are problematic for China itself.

213
00:15:35,420 --> 00:15:40,200
People, both within the country's borders and beyond, are going to wonder why doses

214
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:44,680
are going to foreign arms first, when Chinese citizens are still vulnerable.

215
00:15:44,680 --> 00:15:49,120
They're going to wonder why China didn't use its newfound wealth to purchase more effective

216
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:53,040
and faster-delivering vaccines from foreign manufacturers—they're going to wonder

217
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:58,160
why, when life is back to normal in the West, the country that flouts itself as the conqueror

218
00:15:58,160 --> 00:16:02,340
of the coronavirus is still far from herd immunity.

219
00:16:02,340 --> 00:16:06,660
This wonder will lead to conclusions, and without the narrative control that they so

220
00:16:06,660 --> 00:16:13,680
desperately work to maintain, China's foreign and domestic image might, once again, suffer

221
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:19,340
in what is hopefully COVID-19's third and final act.

222
00:16:19,340 --> 00:16:26,140
So, $15 is about what it costs to get a fancy burger, a movie ticket, or a cocktail at a

223
00:16:26,140 --> 00:16:30,900
nice bar, but it's also what it costs to get a year's worth of access to both Curiosity

224
00:16:30,900 --> 00:16:37,040
Stream and Nebula with the current sale going on at CuriosityStream.com slash Wendover.

225
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:41,920
With that, you can watch any one of the thousands of top-quality documentaries or non-fiction

226
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:46,480
shows on Curiosity Stream, such as Hot Roads, which is about five of the world's most

227
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:49,200
dangerous roads and who uses them.

228
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:54,120
You could also watch all Wendover and HAI videos early and ad-free, and about once a

229
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:58,700
month, like with this video, we publish extended cuts to our normal videos with everything

230
00:16:58,700 --> 00:17:01,000
we had to cut for time on YouTube.

231
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:05,460
In addition, Nebula gives us the funding to make bigger budget and more unique content

232
00:17:05,460 --> 00:17:10,000
that just wouldn't work on YouTube, which we call Nebula Originals, and very soon, we're

233
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:14,720
going to release a brilliant new one—the first documentary filmed on location that

234
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:17,500
we'll have released in almost a year.

235
00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:22,600
Rather unbelievably, all of this can be had for just $15 a year, with the current sale,

236
00:17:22,600 --> 00:17:26,720
only if you go to CuriosityStream.com slash Wendover.

237
00:17:26,740 --> 00:17:31,620
Even better, that $15 goes to help independent creators like us stay independent, and helps

238
00:17:31,620 --> 00:17:37,220
fund the great Nebula Originals from us and others that many of you have come to enjoy.

239
00:17:37,220 --> 00:17:42,080
So, head to CuriosityStream.com slash Wendover and get the bundle deal at its current sale

240
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:44,700
price of just $15 a year.
