00:10.140 --> 00:15.300
The story of Saudi Arabia's oil problem starts with success.

00:15.300 --> 00:20.540
Almost a century ago, after three decades of bloody, complex conquest over belligerents

00:20.540 --> 00:26.860
as small as tribes and as large as the Ottoman Empire, Abdulaziz bin Abdulrahman al-Sad finally

00:26.860 --> 00:31.000
held nearly all of the Arabian Peninsula's territory.

00:31.000 --> 00:37.120
His military and political triumph was rewarded with his ability, on September 23rd, 1932,

00:37.120 --> 00:44.840
to unify his dominions into a single modern Arab state—the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.

00:44.840 --> 00:47.540
That was hardly the end of his success, though.

00:47.540 --> 00:53.280
With newfound, tenuous stability across the peninsula, Abdulaziz started work to verify

00:53.280 --> 00:55.480
a long-held hunch.

00:55.480 --> 01:01.700
He believed, without any real evidence, that there must be oil in Arabia.

01:01.700 --> 01:06.060
This was typically brushed aside by oil companies as the starry-eyed fantasies of a desperate

01:06.060 --> 01:11.160
ruler of an inhospitable land, but he was, of course, correct.

01:11.160 --> 01:17.700
In 1932, neighboring Bahrain struck oil, and suddenly, the king's fantasies weren't

01:17.700 --> 01:19.780
so fanciful after all.

01:19.780 --> 01:27.600
On March 3rd, 1938, Standard Oil of California struck oil at Saudi Arabia's Daman No. 7

01:27.600 --> 01:29.200
drill site.

01:29.200 --> 01:34.260
Successful oil exploration was followed up by more exploration, which too was successful,

01:34.260 --> 01:40.700
and as more and more wells punctuated the Arabian Peninsula, the success only compounded.

01:40.700 --> 01:46.580
As it turned out, this barren, dusty peninsula was home to the single largest proven oil

01:46.580 --> 01:49.060
field on earth.

01:49.060 --> 01:52.120
This was good for Abdulaziz.

01:52.120 --> 01:57.380
He grew rich, his country developed, his kingship was solidified—in a mere decade, he went

01:57.380 --> 02:02.520
from leading some lowly nomadic tribes in an uncharted land to striking diplomatic deals

02:02.520 --> 02:05.180
with the President of the United States.

02:05.180 --> 02:10.140
Prosperity reigned over the coming decades, as power was passed from Abdulaziz to his

02:10.140 --> 02:13.680
son, then to another of his sons, and so on and so forth.

02:13.680 --> 02:18.140
In an era defined by unprecedented success, there was little reason for the people to

02:18.140 --> 02:21.620
push back on a now antiquated form of governance.

02:21.620 --> 02:26.900
A social contract started to emerge—the people would support the monarchy politically

02:26.900 --> 02:29.580
if the monarchy supported the people financially.

02:29.580 --> 02:36.820
Infrastructure, subsidies, handouts, housing—the monarchy provided all.

02:36.820 --> 02:41.600
Saudi Arabia's fortunes only improved as the start of the 21st century ushered in a

02:41.600 --> 02:44.440
historical rise in oil prices.

02:44.440 --> 02:49.680
The country's GDP nearly tripled in just eight years, and Riyadh was inundated by high-end

02:49.680 --> 02:53.600
hotels, foreign faces, and international consulting firms.

02:53.600 --> 03:01.720
The money and fortune seemed endless and effortless… until, of course, it ended.

03:01.720 --> 03:07.960
Crude oil traded at an all-time high of $147.26 in July, 2008.

03:07.960 --> 03:13.020
Over the coming months, as the world descended into its deepest financial crisis since the

03:13.020 --> 03:19.860
Great Depression, prices steadily slid down to just $40 a barrel—a nearly four-fold

03:19.860 --> 03:22.760
collapse in half a year.

03:22.760 --> 03:27.180
The direct impacts of this crash on Saudi Arabia were surprisingly minimal, as the government

03:27.180 --> 03:31.600
had amassed vast financial reserves over the prior decades of prosperity, and oil prices

03:31.600 --> 03:37.380
quickly started ticking up again, ending 2009 at around $80 a barrel—a figure the Kingdom

03:37.380 --> 03:38.700
could live with.

03:38.700 --> 03:40.900
But then it happened again.

03:40.900 --> 03:48.180
In summer 2014, prices began a steady slide that would bottom out at $33 a barrel in January

03:48.180 --> 03:52.880
2016—a symptom of incredible global oversupply.

03:52.880 --> 03:58.740
Between 2016 and 2020, prices would average about $51.20.

03:58.740 --> 04:01.340
The problem, however, was this number.

04:01.340 --> 04:06.280
Over the same period, the break-even oil price—the average price at which the country's oil

04:06.280 --> 04:12.100
industry as a whole turns a profit—was $85.70.

04:12.100 --> 04:16.420
This isn't to say that Saudi oil companies simply couldn't turn a profit, but it does

04:16.420 --> 04:20.800
mean that there were fewer opportunities to turn a profit—there were fewer wells whose

04:20.800 --> 04:25.000
operating costs were low enough to enable profitable operations.

04:25.000 --> 04:30.040
With an oil sector representing close to half of GDP, Saudi Arabia had to dip into its financial

04:30.040 --> 04:33.840
reserves, which therefore began a precipitous decline.

04:33.840 --> 04:38.820
In a country defined by its social compact—financial support by the monarchy in exchange for political

04:38.820 --> 04:43.200
support by the people—seismic changes occurred.

04:43.200 --> 04:49.720
Starting on January 1st, 2018, for the first time ever, the Saudi people were asked to

04:49.720 --> 04:52.100
help fund the government.

04:52.100 --> 05:00.640
On any purchase of goods and services, they would now pay a 5% value-added tax.

05:00.640 --> 05:06.000
Some of the risks of running such a deeply oil-entrenched economy are straightforward.

05:06.000 --> 05:10.040
For example, we know that, sometime in the future, a day will occur that will come to

05:10.040 --> 05:13.000
be known as peak oil.

05:13.000 --> 05:17.680
Experts agree that either demand decline, supply constraints, or a mix of both will

05:17.680 --> 05:22.360
lead to the world's oil production reaching a plateau before a decline.

05:22.360 --> 05:28.880
Now, past predictions on the timing of such an event have overwhelmingly proved inaccurate—most

05:28.880 --> 05:34.120
in the 70s expected production to level off by 2000—but there are now stronger indications

05:34.120 --> 05:37.000
that peak oil is nearing.

05:37.000 --> 05:42.000
Between 2018 and 2019, oil production ticked down slightly.

05:42.000 --> 05:48.160
This wasn't the first year-to-year production drop in the 2000s, but both other instances,

05:48.160 --> 05:54.440
2002 and 2009, can be directly attributed to major external crises—9-11 and the Great

05:54.440 --> 05:55.440
Recession.

05:55.440 --> 06:00.960
In 2019, production dropped simply because of market factors.

06:00.960 --> 06:05.240
Of course then, in 2020, another external crisis occurred which led to the steepest

06:05.240 --> 06:10.800
year-to-year decline in recent history, but the pandemic might lead to structural, long-term

06:10.800 --> 06:15.160
changes, such as less driving with more people working from home, that would result in a

06:15.160 --> 06:17.640
permanent drop in demand.

06:17.640 --> 06:22.920
So now, whether oil production will fully recover and start growing again is in legitimate

06:22.920 --> 06:26.280
question and some answers have started to emerge.

06:26.280 --> 06:32.200
Shell, one of the world's largest oil producers, has said that it believes 2019 was its high

06:32.200 --> 06:34.600
watermark for production.

06:34.600 --> 06:38.500
Peak oil might have already occurred.

06:38.500 --> 06:43.000
That is undoubtedly bad for Saudi Arabia, but potentially less devastating than one

06:43.000 --> 06:46.200
might think, at least in the near term.

06:46.200 --> 06:50.800
Located on some of the most accessible oil fields in the world, Saudi wells boast some

06:50.800 --> 06:54.400
of the world's cheapest production costs, meaning they will not be the first to close

06:54.400 --> 06:56.440
down once demand declines.

06:56.440 --> 07:01.520
However, it's still the case that going forward is going to be harder to base an economy

07:01.520 --> 07:03.600
on oil than before.

07:03.600 --> 07:10.440
Looking at the graph of crude oil prices since 1983, the era before 2005 is noticeably different

07:10.440 --> 07:11.600
than that after.

07:11.600 --> 07:16.960
It's not the prices themselves that matter here—it's the fluctuations.

07:16.960 --> 07:21.020
Oil prices have never before been this volatile.

07:21.020 --> 07:27.400
These semi-regular fourfold spikes or drops that occur in mere months are a new phenomenon.

07:27.400 --> 07:32.480
Running an economy on such a volatile commodity is incredibly difficult, and this price volatility

07:32.480 --> 07:37.280
is only expected to increase in the future as industry disruption ramps up.

07:37.280 --> 07:45.000
Simply put, running an economy on oil, in the 21st century, is not a good idea.

07:45.000 --> 07:47.920
Some in Saudi Arabia know this.

07:47.920 --> 07:54.800
Of King Abdulaziz's 45 sons, 36 survived to adulthood and six ascended to the throne.

07:54.800 --> 08:00.040
Upon the death of his half-brother in 2015, King Salman bin Abdulaziz became the latest

08:00.040 --> 08:01.520
to rule the kingdom.

08:01.520 --> 08:06.960
Already aged 79 and with brothers only marginally younger, the decision was made that Salman

08:06.960 --> 08:12.680
would be the last of his generation to rule, and so Mohammed bin Naif, a grandson of King

08:12.680 --> 08:17.640
Abdulaziz, was appointed crown prince—next in line for the throne.

08:17.640 --> 08:22.080
Meanwhile, Mohammed bin Salman would serve as deputy crown prince.

08:22.080 --> 08:27.800
Two years later, however, shortly before midnight on June 20th, Mohammed bin Naif was summoned

08:27.800 --> 08:31.740
to the Safa Palace in Mecca for a meeting with the king.

08:31.740 --> 08:37.280
That meeting did not materialize, however, as he was led into another room, held captive,

08:37.280 --> 08:42.180
and told by royal court officials that he must give up his claim to the throne.

08:42.180 --> 08:48.140
After hours locked in that room, Mohammed bin Naif agreed to resign.

08:48.140 --> 08:53.700
The deputy crown prince and son of the king, Mohammed bin Salman, was now next in line

08:53.700 --> 08:55.340
for the throne.

08:55.340 --> 09:00.580
Over the years prior, the 31-year-old had quietly worked to amass power in the background,

09:00.580 --> 09:04.460
and increasingly became the face of the Saudi royal family.

09:04.460 --> 09:08.380
Reports indicate that he was indeed responsible for orchestrating the former crown prince

09:08.380 --> 09:11.740
ousting, which is not a stretch to believe.

09:11.740 --> 09:16.820
In fact, he has gained so much influence over his father's decision-making that he is

09:16.820 --> 09:23.060
now considered, nearly universally, the de facto ruler of Saudi Arabia.

09:23.060 --> 09:28.620
Mohammed bin Salman recognized his country's oil problem before his ascent, however.

09:28.620 --> 09:35.140
In late 2015, the McKinsey Global Institute published a detailed 144-page report analyzing

09:35.140 --> 09:40.860
the future prospects of Saudi Arabia's economy in the wake of 2014's oil price crash.

09:40.860 --> 09:43.760
This issued some dire predictions.

09:43.760 --> 09:48.340
Their base case—what they expected would happen without any major, proactive changes

09:48.340 --> 09:54.220
by Saudi Arabia—predicted that between 2014 and 2030, the country's average monthly

09:54.220 --> 10:00.500
household income would fall from $3,800 to $3,000, the unemployment rate would rise from

10:00.500 --> 10:07.300
12 to 22%, and $900 billion in government assets would be replaced by $2 trillion in

10:07.300 --> 10:08.300
debt.

10:08.300 --> 10:14.620
In short, Saudi Arabia was on the path towards fiscal collapse.

10:14.620 --> 10:20.700
This attracted attention—most importantly, that of Mohammed bin Salman.

10:20.700 --> 10:26.300
Marking the first major move on his rise towards de facto ruler, MBS took on the country's

10:26.300 --> 10:28.220
biggest challenge ever.

10:28.220 --> 10:33.860
He fulfilled his reputation as a reformer, and plotted a path to transform Saudi Arabia.

10:33.860 --> 10:37.460
It was called Vision 2030.

10:37.460 --> 10:41.780
According to this plan, transforming Saudi Arabia into a sustainable nation involved

10:41.780 --> 10:48.680
three primary objectives—improve the government, the economy, and society.

10:48.680 --> 10:53.540
That first pillar, government, was perhaps the broadest in scope, ranging between decreasing

10:53.540 --> 10:59.220
corruption, stripping down bureaucracy, moving government services online, and far more.

10:59.220 --> 11:03.620
Perhaps the most dramatic manifestation of this mission occurred mere months after MBS's

11:03.620 --> 11:08.060
promotion at Crown Prince, when some 500 government ministers, businesspeople, and

11:08.060 --> 11:12.700
royal family members were rounded up and detained in the Ritz-Carlton Hotel in Riyadh until

11:12.700 --> 11:14.800
they could stand trial for corruption.

11:14.800 --> 11:20.180
The degree to which this crackdown was legitimate is up for debate, but it did net the government

11:20.180 --> 11:25.860
a hefty $170 billion in assets in the ensuing settlement deals.

11:25.860 --> 11:30.980
The second pillar, related to economic reform, was also composed of a broad collection of

11:30.980 --> 11:35.220
initiatives, including privatizing certain government services, increasing participation

11:35.220 --> 11:40.000
among women in the workforce, attracting increased investment in the country by foreign companies,

11:40.000 --> 11:43.640
recharging government coffers, and growing private sector industries.

11:43.640 --> 11:48.900
In addition, in a country known for its prohibition of all but religious tourists, Saudi Arabia

11:48.900 --> 11:55.340
would now allow and embrace foreign visitors—taking a page from the UAE's Economic Diversification

11:55.340 --> 11:56.420
playbook.

11:56.420 --> 12:01.220
Of course, to make tourism work, one needs a place that tourists want to go, and that's

12:01.220 --> 12:06.220
a key focus of the third and final pillar—improving society.

12:06.220 --> 12:12.860
Now, Saudi society has long been defined by a strict interpretation of Islamic principles.

12:12.860 --> 12:17.300
Shops briefly close for each of five daily prayers, religious police roam the street

12:17.300 --> 12:22.660
enforcing strict dress codes, homosexual activity is punishable by execution, adult women are

12:22.660 --> 12:27.140
required to have a legal guardian to make decisions on their behalf, atheists are legally

12:27.140 --> 12:30.140
defined as terrorists, and plenty more.

12:30.140 --> 12:36.260
In sum, Saudi society was not one that many foreign tourists would feel comfortable visiting,

12:36.260 --> 12:40.900
and beyond that, considering their interpretation of Islamic principles prohibited it, there

12:40.900 --> 12:44.460
was little of what most foreign tourists would consider entertainment.

12:44.460 --> 12:48.180
Therefore, MBS went on a mission to change that.

12:48.180 --> 12:52.620
The country reversed a 30-year ban on movie theaters, and partnered with AMC to open dozens

12:52.620 --> 12:54.380
of cinemas across the country.

12:54.380 --> 12:58.260
It established the region's largest music festival, with artists like David Guetta,

12:58.260 --> 12:59.900
Steve Aoki, and Tiesto.

12:59.900 --> 13:04.060
It inked a deal with Six Flags to open a theme park in the country, and it gained a coveted

13:04.060 --> 13:09.300
spot on 2021's Formula One calendar with the first-ever Saudi Arabian Grand Prix.

13:09.300 --> 13:14.180
In addition, some of their most regressive social policies were abolished.

13:14.180 --> 13:18.060
Women were now allowed to drive, leave the country without their guardian's permission,

13:18.060 --> 13:21.780
watch live sports, and wear a wider variety of clothing types.

13:21.780 --> 13:26.720
Altogether, Saudi Arabia increasingly, on the surface, was starting to look more like

13:26.720 --> 13:32.780
its neighbors, Bahrain, Qatar, and the UAE—countries socially and politically rooted in Islam,

13:32.780 --> 13:36.780
but open to elements of the increasingly globalized Western lifestyle.

13:36.780 --> 13:43.340
Below the surface, however, it soon became clear that far less had changed.

13:43.340 --> 13:50.500
On October 2nd, 2018, shortly after 1pm, journalist and Saudi dissident Jamal Khashoggi entered

13:50.500 --> 13:55.340
the consulate of Saudi Arabia in Istanbul, Turkey to seek necessary documentation for

13:55.340 --> 13:57.000
his upcoming marriage.

13:57.000 --> 13:59.900
He was never seen again.

13:59.900 --> 14:06.700
In the days, weeks, and months that followed, it emerged that Khashoggi had been assassinated—seemingly

14:06.700 --> 14:11.220
in retribution for critical coverage of the Saudi government, and according to the CIA

14:11.220 --> 14:17.060
and other intelligence organizations, the killing was ordered directly by Mohammed bin

14:17.060 --> 14:18.060
Salman.

14:18.540 --> 14:23.460
While stifling dissent was nothing new for Saudi Arabia, the assassination of a journalist

14:23.460 --> 14:27.880
for a Western paper on foreign soil struck a chord with international observers that

14:27.880 --> 14:31.860
elicited a level of outrage unfamiliar for Saudi Arabia.

14:31.860 --> 14:35.940
The country was used to condemn nations by Amnesty International, critical statements

14:35.940 --> 14:40.120
by ministries of foreign affairs, and world news section stories about their various human

14:40.120 --> 14:46.980
rights abuses, but never before had the country's misconduct reached front-page status globally.

14:46.980 --> 14:52.740
Never before had an instance of Saudi cruelty permeated into common knowledge.

14:52.740 --> 14:57.080
Backed up by less-covered incidents such as Saudi Arabia's alleged war crimes in Yemen,

14:57.080 --> 15:00.660
the hacking of Jeff Bezos' phone, who owns the Washington Post where Khashoggi's columns

15:00.660 --> 15:06.260
were published, and continued stifling of dissent, an informal international consensus

15:06.260 --> 15:07.700
was formed.

15:07.700 --> 15:13.460
Despite the more liberal laws, the theme parks, the music festivals, and more, deep down,

15:13.460 --> 15:16.660
Saudi Arabia was not reformed.

15:16.660 --> 15:20.320
And now, the world knew it.

15:20.320 --> 15:22.900
This is an issue for Saudi Arabia.

15:22.900 --> 15:27.580
Now, when David Guetta performs in Saudi Arabia, he has to deal with a barrage of critical

15:27.580 --> 15:28.580
articles.

15:28.580 --> 15:32.540
When Formula One announces its upcoming Saudi Arabia Grand Prix, it is faced with memes

15:32.540 --> 15:35.360
liking it to racing in Pyongyang or Kabul.

15:35.360 --> 15:39.540
When AMC continues with its planned expansion into the country, it encounters reputational

15:39.540 --> 15:43.060
damage when its competitor pulls out on ethical grounds.

15:43.060 --> 15:45.780
This all has a cost.

15:45.780 --> 15:51.480
If a business faces similar profit opportunity in both Saudi Arabia and, say, the UAE, they're

15:51.480 --> 15:55.540
going to pick the UAE as it's been far more successful at building a friendly face for

15:55.540 --> 16:01.120
the West, despite an also iffy record on human rights—altogether.

16:01.120 --> 16:07.260
These and other factors have meant that Vision 2030 is still but a vision.

16:07.260 --> 16:13.120
The plan laid out four key performance indicators to track the highest-level goals of the project.

16:13.120 --> 16:17.480
The first was the percentage of the country's gross domestic product attributable to the

16:17.480 --> 16:22.080
private sector, rather than state-owned enterprises like Saudi Aramco.

16:22.080 --> 16:28.360
Considering the private sector involves non-oil industries, growing it is key to diversification.

16:28.360 --> 16:34.520
In 2016, this percentage stood at 40%, and the goal was for it to reach 65 by 2030.

16:34.520 --> 16:41.160
Today, over the past four financial quarters, that number stands at 42.7%.

16:41.160 --> 16:46.880
A crucial aspect of growing non-oil revenues involves attracting foreign direct investments.

16:46.880 --> 16:51.440
They want, for example, an investor from Singapore to decide to open a Hilton at the new Six

16:51.440 --> 16:53.240
Flags theme park.

16:53.240 --> 16:58.160
Foreign investment is key to kickstarting natural, compounding, private sector economic

16:58.160 --> 16:59.160
growth.

16:59.160 --> 17:04.820
In 2016, foreign direct investment represented 3.8% of the country's GDP, at least according

17:04.820 --> 17:09.960
to the Saudi government, and the goal was for it to grow to 5.7% by 2030.

17:09.960 --> 17:16.400
Today, according to the World Bank, foreign direct investment represents only 0.57% of

17:16.400 --> 17:17.640
GDP.

17:17.640 --> 17:23.600
The next indicator, non-oil exports as a percentage of overall exports, is perhaps the only glimmer

17:23.600 --> 17:24.600
of hope.

17:24.600 --> 17:32.440
With a 2016 baseline of 16% and a goal of 50% by 2030, 22.4% of the country's exports

17:32.440 --> 17:35.060
are now non-oil products.

17:35.060 --> 17:39.780
This is, however, well below the pace of growth needed to reach the goal.

17:39.780 --> 17:46.060
Finally, the unemployment rate of Saudi nationals stood at 11.6% in 2016, and despite the goal

17:46.060 --> 17:52.620
of bringing it down to 7% by 2030, it has since ticked up slightly to 11.7%.

17:52.620 --> 17:57.900
All around, the vision of 2030 is not being realized.

17:57.900 --> 18:04.060
Now, of course there's been an unprecedented pandemic, of course oil prices have been low,

18:04.060 --> 18:09.380
and of course these are only the first years of reform, but all that notwithstanding, there's

18:09.380 --> 18:13.620
little evidence of deviation from the current failing path.

18:13.620 --> 18:17.940
A huge chunk of the government's money is being sunk into mega-development projects

18:17.940 --> 18:23.140
like a $500 billion planned smart city along the Red Sea, or a $3 billion entertainment

18:23.140 --> 18:28.560
district near Riyadh to play host to the Six Flags, Formula One track, and more, but mega-projects

18:28.560 --> 18:31.340
like this don't work.

18:31.340 --> 18:35.820
In the United Arab Emirates, flashy developments like the Burj Khalifa and the Palm Islands

18:35.820 --> 18:40.180
weren't what transformed the country into the most diversified economy in the region.

18:40.180 --> 18:45.780
It was the unglamorous, boring task of crafting a business environment that the world feels

18:45.780 --> 18:48.000
they can cooperate with.

18:48.000 --> 18:52.860
Businesses want access to Saudi Arabia because it's a massive untapped market, but right

18:52.860 --> 18:56.340
now it's just too risky an environment for them.

18:56.340 --> 19:01.420
It's too risky to operate in an absolute monarchy with a track record of volatile infighting.

19:01.420 --> 19:06.240
It's too risky to operate in a country known for eye-catching human rights abuses at home

19:06.240 --> 19:07.240
and abroad.

19:07.240 --> 19:11.100
It's too risky to operate in a country where women in the workplace have fewer rights than

19:11.100 --> 19:12.300
their male counterparts.

19:12.300 --> 19:17.320
It's too risky to operate in a country whose legal system is based on a strict yet ambiguous

19:17.320 --> 19:19.660
interpretation of Sharia law.

19:19.660 --> 19:24.940
Saudi Arabia has the riches to brute force some private sector growth.

19:24.940 --> 19:29.980
It has the money to lure some international investment, but as of yet, it does not have

19:29.980 --> 19:34.300
the vision to kickstart organic economic transformation.

19:34.300 --> 19:39.060
Reform so far has been superficial, but those making the decisions that matter to Saudi

19:39.060 --> 19:41.660
Arabia can see through that.

19:41.660 --> 19:47.620
Therefore, if Saudi Arabia actually wants to cement its place in 2030's world, it's

19:47.620 --> 19:54.860
going to have to engage in what its leaders want least—radical, fundamental, systematic

19:54.860 --> 19:57.820
change.

19:57.820 --> 20:02.420
As the story of Saudi Arabia proves so well, diversification is crucial, and this doesn't

20:02.420 --> 20:06.740
only apply to massive world economies, but also to you.

20:06.740 --> 20:10.940
Being someone who can do one thing well is great, but being someone who can do a wide

20:10.940 --> 20:14.780
variety of things makes you uniquely valuable and irreplaceable.

20:15.660 --> 20:18.020
That's why I find Skillshare so useful.
