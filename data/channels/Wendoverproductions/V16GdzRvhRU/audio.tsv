10140	15300	The story of Saudi Arabia's oil problem starts with success.
15300	20540	Almost a century ago, after three decades of bloody, complex conquest over belligerents
20540	26860	as small as tribes and as large as the Ottoman Empire, Abdulaziz bin Abdulrahman al-Sad finally
26860	31000	held nearly all of the Arabian Peninsula's territory.
31000	37120	His military and political triumph was rewarded with his ability, on September 23rd, 1932,
37120	44840	to unify his dominions into a single modern Arab state—the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.
44840	47540	That was hardly the end of his success, though.
47540	53280	With newfound, tenuous stability across the peninsula, Abdulaziz started work to verify
53280	55480	a long-held hunch.
55480	61700	He believed, without any real evidence, that there must be oil in Arabia.
61700	66060	This was typically brushed aside by oil companies as the starry-eyed fantasies of a desperate
66060	71160	ruler of an inhospitable land, but he was, of course, correct.
71160	77700	In 1932, neighboring Bahrain struck oil, and suddenly, the king's fantasies weren't
77700	79780	so fanciful after all.
79780	87600	On March 3rd, 1938, Standard Oil of California struck oil at Saudi Arabia's Daman No. 7
87600	89200	drill site.
89200	94260	Successful oil exploration was followed up by more exploration, which too was successful,
94260	100700	and as more and more wells punctuated the Arabian Peninsula, the success only compounded.
100700	106580	As it turned out, this barren, dusty peninsula was home to the single largest proven oil
106580	109060	field on earth.
109060	112120	This was good for Abdulaziz.
112120	117380	He grew rich, his country developed, his kingship was solidified—in a mere decade, he went
117380	122520	from leading some lowly nomadic tribes in an uncharted land to striking diplomatic deals
122520	125180	with the President of the United States.
125180	130140	Prosperity reigned over the coming decades, as power was passed from Abdulaziz to his
130140	133680	son, then to another of his sons, and so on and so forth.
133680	138140	In an era defined by unprecedented success, there was little reason for the people to
138140	141620	push back on a now antiquated form of governance.
141620	146900	A social contract started to emerge—the people would support the monarchy politically
146900	149580	if the monarchy supported the people financially.
149580	156820	Infrastructure, subsidies, handouts, housing—the monarchy provided all.
156820	161600	Saudi Arabia's fortunes only improved as the start of the 21st century ushered in a
161600	164440	historical rise in oil prices.
164440	169680	The country's GDP nearly tripled in just eight years, and Riyadh was inundated by high-end
169680	173600	hotels, foreign faces, and international consulting firms.
173600	181720	The money and fortune seemed endless and effortless… until, of course, it ended.
181720	187960	Crude oil traded at an all-time high of $147.26 in July, 2008.
187960	193020	Over the coming months, as the world descended into its deepest financial crisis since the
193020	199860	Great Depression, prices steadily slid down to just $40 a barrel—a nearly four-fold
199860	202760	collapse in half a year.
202760	207180	The direct impacts of this crash on Saudi Arabia were surprisingly minimal, as the government
207180	211600	had amassed vast financial reserves over the prior decades of prosperity, and oil prices
211600	217380	quickly started ticking up again, ending 2009 at around $80 a barrel—a figure the Kingdom
217380	218700	could live with.
218700	220900	But then it happened again.
220900	228180	In summer 2014, prices began a steady slide that would bottom out at $33 a barrel in January
228180	232880	2016—a symptom of incredible global oversupply.
232880	238740	Between 2016 and 2020, prices would average about $51.20.
238740	241340	The problem, however, was this number.
241340	246280	Over the same period, the break-even oil price—the average price at which the country's oil
246280	252100	industry as a whole turns a profit—was $85.70.
252100	256420	This isn't to say that Saudi oil companies simply couldn't turn a profit, but it does
256420	260800	mean that there were fewer opportunities to turn a profit—there were fewer wells whose
260800	265000	operating costs were low enough to enable profitable operations.
265000	270040	With an oil sector representing close to half of GDP, Saudi Arabia had to dip into its financial
270040	273840	reserves, which therefore began a precipitous decline.
273840	278820	In a country defined by its social compact—financial support by the monarchy in exchange for political
278820	283200	support by the people—seismic changes occurred.
283200	289720	Starting on January 1st, 2018, for the first time ever, the Saudi people were asked to
289720	292100	help fund the government.
292100	300640	On any purchase of goods and services, they would now pay a 5% value-added tax.
300640	306000	Some of the risks of running such a deeply oil-entrenched economy are straightforward.
306000	310040	For example, we know that, sometime in the future, a day will occur that will come to
310040	313000	be known as peak oil.
313000	317680	Experts agree that either demand decline, supply constraints, or a mix of both will
317680	322360	lead to the world's oil production reaching a plateau before a decline.
322360	328880	Now, past predictions on the timing of such an event have overwhelmingly proved inaccurate—most
328880	334120	in the 70s expected production to level off by 2000—but there are now stronger indications
334120	337000	that peak oil is nearing.
337000	342000	Between 2018 and 2019, oil production ticked down slightly.
342000	348160	This wasn't the first year-to-year production drop in the 2000s, but both other instances,
348160	354440	2002 and 2009, can be directly attributed to major external crises—9-11 and the Great
354440	355440	Recession.
355440	360960	In 2019, production dropped simply because of market factors.
360960	365240	Of course then, in 2020, another external crisis occurred which led to the steepest
365240	370800	year-to-year decline in recent history, but the pandemic might lead to structural, long-term
370800	375160	changes, such as less driving with more people working from home, that would result in a
375160	377640	permanent drop in demand.
377640	382920	So now, whether oil production will fully recover and start growing again is in legitimate
382920	386280	question and some answers have started to emerge.
386280	392200	Shell, one of the world's largest oil producers, has said that it believes 2019 was its high
392200	394600	watermark for production.
394600	398500	Peak oil might have already occurred.
398500	403000	That is undoubtedly bad for Saudi Arabia, but potentially less devastating than one
403000	406200	might think, at least in the near term.
406200	410800	Located on some of the most accessible oil fields in the world, Saudi wells boast some
410800	414400	of the world's cheapest production costs, meaning they will not be the first to close
414400	416440	down once demand declines.
416440	421520	However, it's still the case that going forward is going to be harder to base an economy
421520	423600	on oil than before.
423600	430440	Looking at the graph of crude oil prices since 1983, the era before 2005 is noticeably different
430440	431600	than that after.
431600	436960	It's not the prices themselves that matter here—it's the fluctuations.
436960	441020	Oil prices have never before been this volatile.
441020	447400	These semi-regular fourfold spikes or drops that occur in mere months are a new phenomenon.
447400	452480	Running an economy on such a volatile commodity is incredibly difficult, and this price volatility
452480	457280	is only expected to increase in the future as industry disruption ramps up.
457280	465000	Simply put, running an economy on oil, in the 21st century, is not a good idea.
465000	467920	Some in Saudi Arabia know this.
467920	474800	Of King Abdulaziz's 45 sons, 36 survived to adulthood and six ascended to the throne.
474800	480040	Upon the death of his half-brother in 2015, King Salman bin Abdulaziz became the latest
480040	481520	to rule the kingdom.
481520	486960	Already aged 79 and with brothers only marginally younger, the decision was made that Salman
486960	492680	would be the last of his generation to rule, and so Mohammed bin Naif, a grandson of King
492680	497640	Abdulaziz, was appointed crown prince—next in line for the throne.
497640	502080	Meanwhile, Mohammed bin Salman would serve as deputy crown prince.
502080	507800	Two years later, however, shortly before midnight on June 20th, Mohammed bin Naif was summoned
507800	511740	to the Safa Palace in Mecca for a meeting with the king.
511740	517280	That meeting did not materialize, however, as he was led into another room, held captive,
517280	522180	and told by royal court officials that he must give up his claim to the throne.
522180	528140	After hours locked in that room, Mohammed bin Naif agreed to resign.
528140	533700	The deputy crown prince and son of the king, Mohammed bin Salman, was now next in line
533700	535340	for the throne.
535340	540580	Over the years prior, the 31-year-old had quietly worked to amass power in the background,
540580	544460	and increasingly became the face of the Saudi royal family.
544460	548380	Reports indicate that he was indeed responsible for orchestrating the former crown prince
548380	551740	ousting, which is not a stretch to believe.
551740	556820	In fact, he has gained so much influence over his father's decision-making that he is
556820	563060	now considered, nearly universally, the de facto ruler of Saudi Arabia.
563060	568620	Mohammed bin Salman recognized his country's oil problem before his ascent, however.
568620	575140	In late 2015, the McKinsey Global Institute published a detailed 144-page report analyzing
575140	580860	the future prospects of Saudi Arabia's economy in the wake of 2014's oil price crash.
580860	583760	This issued some dire predictions.
583760	588340	Their base case—what they expected would happen without any major, proactive changes
588340	594220	by Saudi Arabia—predicted that between 2014 and 2030, the country's average monthly
594220	600500	household income would fall from $3,800 to $3,000, the unemployment rate would rise from
600500	607300	12 to 22%, and $900 billion in government assets would be replaced by $2 trillion in
607300	608300	debt.
608300	614620	In short, Saudi Arabia was on the path towards fiscal collapse.
614620	620700	This attracted attention—most importantly, that of Mohammed bin Salman.
620700	626300	Marking the first major move on his rise towards de facto ruler, MBS took on the country's
626300	628220	biggest challenge ever.
628220	633860	He fulfilled his reputation as a reformer, and plotted a path to transform Saudi Arabia.
633860	637460	It was called Vision 2030.
637460	641780	According to this plan, transforming Saudi Arabia into a sustainable nation involved
641780	648680	three primary objectives—improve the government, the economy, and society.
648680	653540	That first pillar, government, was perhaps the broadest in scope, ranging between decreasing
653540	659220	corruption, stripping down bureaucracy, moving government services online, and far more.
659220	663620	Perhaps the most dramatic manifestation of this mission occurred mere months after MBS's
663620	668060	promotion at Crown Prince, when some 500 government ministers, businesspeople, and
668060	672700	royal family members were rounded up and detained in the Ritz-Carlton Hotel in Riyadh until
672700	674800	they could stand trial for corruption.
674800	680180	The degree to which this crackdown was legitimate is up for debate, but it did net the government
680180	685860	a hefty $170 billion in assets in the ensuing settlement deals.
685860	690980	The second pillar, related to economic reform, was also composed of a broad collection of
690980	695220	initiatives, including privatizing certain government services, increasing participation
695220	700000	among women in the workforce, attracting increased investment in the country by foreign companies,
700000	703640	recharging government coffers, and growing private sector industries.
703640	708900	In addition, in a country known for its prohibition of all but religious tourists, Saudi Arabia
708900	715340	would now allow and embrace foreign visitors—taking a page from the UAE's Economic Diversification
715340	716420	playbook.
716420	721220	Of course, to make tourism work, one needs a place that tourists want to go, and that's
721220	726220	a key focus of the third and final pillar—improving society.
726220	732860	Now, Saudi society has long been defined by a strict interpretation of Islamic principles.
732860	737300	Shops briefly close for each of five daily prayers, religious police roam the street
737300	742660	enforcing strict dress codes, homosexual activity is punishable by execution, adult women are
742660	747140	required to have a legal guardian to make decisions on their behalf, atheists are legally
747140	750140	defined as terrorists, and plenty more.
750140	756260	In sum, Saudi society was not one that many foreign tourists would feel comfortable visiting,
756260	760900	and beyond that, considering their interpretation of Islamic principles prohibited it, there
760900	764460	was little of what most foreign tourists would consider entertainment.
764460	768180	Therefore, MBS went on a mission to change that.
768180	772620	The country reversed a 30-year ban on movie theaters, and partnered with AMC to open dozens
772620	774380	of cinemas across the country.
774380	778260	It established the region's largest music festival, with artists like David Guetta,
778260	779900	Steve Aoki, and Tiesto.
779900	784060	It inked a deal with Six Flags to open a theme park in the country, and it gained a coveted
784060	789300	spot on 2021's Formula One calendar with the first-ever Saudi Arabian Grand Prix.
789300	794180	In addition, some of their most regressive social policies were abolished.
794180	798060	Women were now allowed to drive, leave the country without their guardian's permission,
798060	801780	watch live sports, and wear a wider variety of clothing types.
801780	806720	Altogether, Saudi Arabia increasingly, on the surface, was starting to look more like
806720	812780	its neighbors, Bahrain, Qatar, and the UAE—countries socially and politically rooted in Islam,
812780	816780	but open to elements of the increasingly globalized Western lifestyle.
816780	823340	Below the surface, however, it soon became clear that far less had changed.
823340	830500	On October 2nd, 2018, shortly after 1pm, journalist and Saudi dissident Jamal Khashoggi entered
830500	835340	the consulate of Saudi Arabia in Istanbul, Turkey to seek necessary documentation for
835340	837000	his upcoming marriage.
837000	839900	He was never seen again.
839900	846700	In the days, weeks, and months that followed, it emerged that Khashoggi had been assassinated—seemingly
846700	851220	in retribution for critical coverage of the Saudi government, and according to the CIA
851220	857060	and other intelligence organizations, the killing was ordered directly by Mohammed bin
857060	858060	Salman.
858540	863460	While stifling dissent was nothing new for Saudi Arabia, the assassination of a journalist
863460	867880	for a Western paper on foreign soil struck a chord with international observers that
867880	871860	elicited a level of outrage unfamiliar for Saudi Arabia.
871860	875940	The country was used to condemn nations by Amnesty International, critical statements
875940	880120	by ministries of foreign affairs, and world news section stories about their various human
880120	886980	rights abuses, but never before had the country's misconduct reached front-page status globally.
886980	892740	Never before had an instance of Saudi cruelty permeated into common knowledge.
892740	897080	Backed up by less-covered incidents such as Saudi Arabia's alleged war crimes in Yemen,
897080	900660	the hacking of Jeff Bezos' phone, who owns the Washington Post where Khashoggi's columns
900660	906260	were published, and continued stifling of dissent, an informal international consensus
906260	907700	was formed.
907700	913460	Despite the more liberal laws, the theme parks, the music festivals, and more, deep down,
913460	916660	Saudi Arabia was not reformed.
916660	920320	And now, the world knew it.
920320	922900	This is an issue for Saudi Arabia.
922900	927580	Now, when David Guetta performs in Saudi Arabia, he has to deal with a barrage of critical
927580	928580	articles.
928580	932540	When Formula One announces its upcoming Saudi Arabia Grand Prix, it is faced with memes
932540	935360	liking it to racing in Pyongyang or Kabul.
935360	939540	When AMC continues with its planned expansion into the country, it encounters reputational
939540	943060	damage when its competitor pulls out on ethical grounds.
943060	945780	This all has a cost.
945780	951480	If a business faces similar profit opportunity in both Saudi Arabia and, say, the UAE, they're
951480	955540	going to pick the UAE as it's been far more successful at building a friendly face for
955540	961120	the West, despite an also iffy record on human rights—altogether.
961120	967260	These and other factors have meant that Vision 2030 is still but a vision.
967260	973120	The plan laid out four key performance indicators to track the highest-level goals of the project.
973120	977480	The first was the percentage of the country's gross domestic product attributable to the
977480	982080	private sector, rather than state-owned enterprises like Saudi Aramco.
982080	988360	Considering the private sector involves non-oil industries, growing it is key to diversification.
988360	994520	In 2016, this percentage stood at 40%, and the goal was for it to reach 65 by 2030.
994520	1001160	Today, over the past four financial quarters, that number stands at 42.7%.
1001160	1006880	A crucial aspect of growing non-oil revenues involves attracting foreign direct investments.
1006880	1011440	They want, for example, an investor from Singapore to decide to open a Hilton at the new Six
1011440	1013240	Flags theme park.
1013240	1018160	Foreign investment is key to kickstarting natural, compounding, private sector economic
1018160	1019160	growth.
1019160	1024820	In 2016, foreign direct investment represented 3.8% of the country's GDP, at least according
1024820	1029960	to the Saudi government, and the goal was for it to grow to 5.7% by 2030.
1029960	1036400	Today, according to the World Bank, foreign direct investment represents only 0.57% of
1036400	1037640	GDP.
1037640	1043600	The next indicator, non-oil exports as a percentage of overall exports, is perhaps the only glimmer
1043600	1044600	of hope.
1044600	1052440	With a 2016 baseline of 16% and a goal of 50% by 2030, 22.4% of the country's exports
1052440	1055060	are now non-oil products.
1055060	1059780	This is, however, well below the pace of growth needed to reach the goal.
1059780	1066060	Finally, the unemployment rate of Saudi nationals stood at 11.6% in 2016, and despite the goal
1066060	1072620	of bringing it down to 7% by 2030, it has since ticked up slightly to 11.7%.
1072620	1077900	All around, the vision of 2030 is not being realized.
1077900	1084060	Now, of course there's been an unprecedented pandemic, of course oil prices have been low,
1084060	1089380	and of course these are only the first years of reform, but all that notwithstanding, there's
1089380	1093620	little evidence of deviation from the current failing path.
1093620	1097940	A huge chunk of the government's money is being sunk into mega-development projects
1097940	1103140	like a $500 billion planned smart city along the Red Sea, or a $3 billion entertainment
1103140	1108560	district near Riyadh to play host to the Six Flags, Formula One track, and more, but mega-projects
1108560	1111340	like this don't work.
1111340	1115820	In the United Arab Emirates, flashy developments like the Burj Khalifa and the Palm Islands
1115820	1120180	weren't what transformed the country into the most diversified economy in the region.
1120180	1125780	It was the unglamorous, boring task of crafting a business environment that the world feels
1125780	1128000	they can cooperate with.
1128000	1132860	Businesses want access to Saudi Arabia because it's a massive untapped market, but right
1132860	1136340	now it's just too risky an environment for them.
1136340	1141420	It's too risky to operate in an absolute monarchy with a track record of volatile infighting.
1141420	1146240	It's too risky to operate in a country known for eye-catching human rights abuses at home
1146240	1147240	and abroad.
1147240	1151100	It's too risky to operate in a country where women in the workplace have fewer rights than
1151100	1152300	their male counterparts.
1152300	1157320	It's too risky to operate in a country whose legal system is based on a strict yet ambiguous
1157320	1159660	interpretation of Sharia law.
1159660	1164940	Saudi Arabia has the riches to brute force some private sector growth.
1164940	1169980	It has the money to lure some international investment, but as of yet, it does not have
1169980	1174300	the vision to kickstart organic economic transformation.
1174300	1179060	Reform so far has been superficial, but those making the decisions that matter to Saudi
1179060	1181660	Arabia can see through that.
1181660	1187620	Therefore, if Saudi Arabia actually wants to cement its place in 2030's world, it's
1187620	1194860	going to have to engage in what its leaders want least—radical, fundamental, systematic
1194860	1197820	change.
1197820	1202420	As the story of Saudi Arabia proves so well, diversification is crucial, and this doesn't
1202420	1206740	only apply to massive world economies, but also to you.
1206740	1210940	Being someone who can do one thing well is great, but being someone who can do a wide
1210940	1214780	variety of things makes you uniquely valuable and irreplaceable.
