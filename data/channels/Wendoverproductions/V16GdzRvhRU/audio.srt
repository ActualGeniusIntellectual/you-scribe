4
00:00:10,140 --> 00:00:15,300
The story of Saudi Arabia's oil problem starts with success.

5
00:00:15,300 --> 00:00:20,540
Almost a century ago, after three decades of bloody, complex conquest over belligerents

6
00:00:20,540 --> 00:00:26,860
as small as tribes and as large as the Ottoman Empire, Abdulaziz bin Abdulrahman al-Sad finally

7
00:00:26,860 --> 00:00:31,000
held nearly all of the Arabian Peninsula's territory.

8
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:37,120
His military and political triumph was rewarded with his ability, on September 23rd, 1932,

9
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:44,840
to unify his dominions into a single modern Arab state—the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.

10
00:00:44,840 --> 00:00:47,540
That was hardly the end of his success, though.

11
00:00:47,540 --> 00:00:53,280
With newfound, tenuous stability across the peninsula, Abdulaziz started work to verify

12
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:55,480
a long-held hunch.

13
00:00:55,480 --> 00:01:01,700
He believed, without any real evidence, that there must be oil in Arabia.

14
00:01:01,700 --> 00:01:06,060
This was typically brushed aside by oil companies as the starry-eyed fantasies of a desperate

15
00:01:06,060 --> 00:01:11,160
ruler of an inhospitable land, but he was, of course, correct.

16
00:01:11,160 --> 00:01:17,700
In 1932, neighboring Bahrain struck oil, and suddenly, the king's fantasies weren't

17
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:19,780
so fanciful after all.

18
00:01:19,780 --> 00:01:27,600
On March 3rd, 1938, Standard Oil of California struck oil at Saudi Arabia's Daman No. 7

19
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:29,200
drill site.

20
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:34,260
Successful oil exploration was followed up by more exploration, which too was successful,

21
00:01:34,260 --> 00:01:40,700
and as more and more wells punctuated the Arabian Peninsula, the success only compounded.

22
00:01:40,700 --> 00:01:46,580
As it turned out, this barren, dusty peninsula was home to the single largest proven oil

23
00:01:46,580 --> 00:01:49,060
field on earth.

24
00:01:49,060 --> 00:01:52,120
This was good for Abdulaziz.

25
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:57,380
He grew rich, his country developed, his kingship was solidified—in a mere decade, he went

26
00:01:57,380 --> 00:02:02,520
from leading some lowly nomadic tribes in an uncharted land to striking diplomatic deals

27
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:05,180
with the President of the United States.

28
00:02:05,180 --> 00:02:10,140
Prosperity reigned over the coming decades, as power was passed from Abdulaziz to his

29
00:02:10,140 --> 00:02:13,680
son, then to another of his sons, and so on and so forth.

30
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:18,140
In an era defined by unprecedented success, there was little reason for the people to

31
00:02:18,140 --> 00:02:21,620
push back on a now antiquated form of governance.

32
00:02:21,620 --> 00:02:26,900
A social contract started to emerge—the people would support the monarchy politically

33
00:02:26,900 --> 00:02:29,580
if the monarchy supported the people financially.

34
00:02:29,580 --> 00:02:36,820
Infrastructure, subsidies, handouts, housing—the monarchy provided all.

35
00:02:36,820 --> 00:02:41,600
Saudi Arabia's fortunes only improved as the start of the 21st century ushered in a

36
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:44,440
historical rise in oil prices.

37
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:49,680
The country's GDP nearly tripled in just eight years, and Riyadh was inundated by high-end

38
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:53,600
hotels, foreign faces, and international consulting firms.

39
00:02:53,600 --> 00:03:01,720
The money and fortune seemed endless and effortless… until, of course, it ended.

40
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:07,960
Crude oil traded at an all-time high of $147.26 in July, 2008.

41
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:13,020
Over the coming months, as the world descended into its deepest financial crisis since the

42
00:03:13,020 --> 00:03:19,860
Great Depression, prices steadily slid down to just $40 a barrel—a nearly four-fold

43
00:03:19,860 --> 00:03:22,760
collapse in half a year.

44
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:27,180
The direct impacts of this crash on Saudi Arabia were surprisingly minimal, as the government

45
00:03:27,180 --> 00:03:31,600
had amassed vast financial reserves over the prior decades of prosperity, and oil prices

46
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:37,380
quickly started ticking up again, ending 2009 at around $80 a barrel—a figure the Kingdom

47
00:03:37,380 --> 00:03:38,700
could live with.

48
00:03:38,700 --> 00:03:40,900
But then it happened again.

49
00:03:40,900 --> 00:03:48,180
In summer 2014, prices began a steady slide that would bottom out at $33 a barrel in January

50
00:03:48,180 --> 00:03:52,880
2016—a symptom of incredible global oversupply.

51
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:58,740
Between 2016 and 2020, prices would average about $51.20.

52
00:03:58,740 --> 00:04:01,340
The problem, however, was this number.

53
00:04:01,340 --> 00:04:06,280
Over the same period, the break-even oil price—the average price at which the country's oil

54
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:12,100
industry as a whole turns a profit—was $85.70.

55
00:04:12,100 --> 00:04:16,420
This isn't to say that Saudi oil companies simply couldn't turn a profit, but it does

56
00:04:16,420 --> 00:04:20,800
mean that there were fewer opportunities to turn a profit—there were fewer wells whose

57
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:25,000
operating costs were low enough to enable profitable operations.

58
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:30,040
With an oil sector representing close to half of GDP, Saudi Arabia had to dip into its financial

59
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:33,840
reserves, which therefore began a precipitous decline.

60
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:38,820
In a country defined by its social compact—financial support by the monarchy in exchange for political

61
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:43,200
support by the people—seismic changes occurred.

62
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:49,720
Starting on January 1st, 2018, for the first time ever, the Saudi people were asked to

63
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:52,100
help fund the government.

64
00:04:52,100 --> 00:05:00,640
On any purchase of goods and services, they would now pay a 5% value-added tax.

65
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:06,000
Some of the risks of running such a deeply oil-entrenched economy are straightforward.

66
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:10,040
For example, we know that, sometime in the future, a day will occur that will come to

67
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:13,000
be known as peak oil.

68
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:17,680
Experts agree that either demand decline, supply constraints, or a mix of both will

69
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:22,360
lead to the world's oil production reaching a plateau before a decline.

70
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:28,880
Now, past predictions on the timing of such an event have overwhelmingly proved inaccurate—most

71
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:34,120
in the 70s expected production to level off by 2000—but there are now stronger indications

72
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:37,000
that peak oil is nearing.

73
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Between 2018 and 2019, oil production ticked down slightly.

74
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:48,160
This wasn't the first year-to-year production drop in the 2000s, but both other instances,

75
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:54,440
2002 and 2009, can be directly attributed to major external crises—9-11 and the Great

76
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:55,440
Recession.

77
00:05:55,440 --> 00:06:00,960
In 2019, production dropped simply because of market factors.

78
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:05,240
Of course then, in 2020, another external crisis occurred which led to the steepest

79
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:10,800
year-to-year decline in recent history, but the pandemic might lead to structural, long-term

80
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:15,160
changes, such as less driving with more people working from home, that would result in a

81
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:17,640
permanent drop in demand.

82
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:22,920
So now, whether oil production will fully recover and start growing again is in legitimate

83
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:26,280
question and some answers have started to emerge.

84
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:32,200
Shell, one of the world's largest oil producers, has said that it believes 2019 was its high

85
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:34,600
watermark for production.

86
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:38,500
Peak oil might have already occurred.

87
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:43,000
That is undoubtedly bad for Saudi Arabia, but potentially less devastating than one

88
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:46,200
might think, at least in the near term.

89
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:50,800
Located on some of the most accessible oil fields in the world, Saudi wells boast some

90
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:54,400
of the world's cheapest production costs, meaning they will not be the first to close

91
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:56,440
down once demand declines.

92
00:06:56,440 --> 00:07:01,520
However, it's still the case that going forward is going to be harder to base an economy

93
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:03,600
on oil than before.

94
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:10,440
Looking at the graph of crude oil prices since 1983, the era before 2005 is noticeably different

95
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:11,600
than that after.

96
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:16,960
It's not the prices themselves that matter here—it's the fluctuations.

97
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:21,020
Oil prices have never before been this volatile.

98
00:07:21,020 --> 00:07:27,400
These semi-regular fourfold spikes or drops that occur in mere months are a new phenomenon.

99
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:32,480
Running an economy on such a volatile commodity is incredibly difficult, and this price volatility

100
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:37,280
is only expected to increase in the future as industry disruption ramps up.

101
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:45,000
Simply put, running an economy on oil, in the 21st century, is not a good idea.

102
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,920
Some in Saudi Arabia know this.

103
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:54,800
Of King Abdulaziz's 45 sons, 36 survived to adulthood and six ascended to the throne.

104
00:07:54,800 --> 00:08:00,040
Upon the death of his half-brother in 2015, King Salman bin Abdulaziz became the latest

105
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:01,520
to rule the kingdom.

106
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:06,960
Already aged 79 and with brothers only marginally younger, the decision was made that Salman

107
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:12,680
would be the last of his generation to rule, and so Mohammed bin Naif, a grandson of King

108
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:17,640
Abdulaziz, was appointed crown prince—next in line for the throne.

109
00:08:17,640 --> 00:08:22,080
Meanwhile, Mohammed bin Salman would serve as deputy crown prince.

110
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:27,800
Two years later, however, shortly before midnight on June 20th, Mohammed bin Naif was summoned

111
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:31,740
to the Safa Palace in Mecca for a meeting with the king.

112
00:08:31,740 --> 00:08:37,280
That meeting did not materialize, however, as he was led into another room, held captive,

113
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:42,180
and told by royal court officials that he must give up his claim to the throne.

114
00:08:42,180 --> 00:08:48,140
After hours locked in that room, Mohammed bin Naif agreed to resign.

115
00:08:48,140 --> 00:08:53,700
The deputy crown prince and son of the king, Mohammed bin Salman, was now next in line

116
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:55,340
for the throne.

117
00:08:55,340 --> 00:09:00,580
Over the years prior, the 31-year-old had quietly worked to amass power in the background,

118
00:09:00,580 --> 00:09:04,460
and increasingly became the face of the Saudi royal family.

119
00:09:04,460 --> 00:09:08,380
Reports indicate that he was indeed responsible for orchestrating the former crown prince

120
00:09:08,380 --> 00:09:11,740
ousting, which is not a stretch to believe.

121
00:09:11,740 --> 00:09:16,820
In fact, he has gained so much influence over his father's decision-making that he is

122
00:09:16,820 --> 00:09:23,060
now considered, nearly universally, the de facto ruler of Saudi Arabia.

123
00:09:23,060 --> 00:09:28,620
Mohammed bin Salman recognized his country's oil problem before his ascent, however.

124
00:09:28,620 --> 00:09:35,140
In late 2015, the McKinsey Global Institute published a detailed 144-page report analyzing

125
00:09:35,140 --> 00:09:40,860
the future prospects of Saudi Arabia's economy in the wake of 2014's oil price crash.

126
00:09:40,860 --> 00:09:43,760
This issued some dire predictions.

127
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:48,340
Their base case—what they expected would happen without any major, proactive changes

128
00:09:48,340 --> 00:09:54,220
by Saudi Arabia—predicted that between 2014 and 2030, the country's average monthly

129
00:09:54,220 --> 00:10:00,500
household income would fall from $3,800 to $3,000, the unemployment rate would rise from

130
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:07,300
12 to 22%, and $900 billion in government assets would be replaced by $2 trillion in

131
00:10:07,300 --> 00:10:08,300
debt.

132
00:10:08,300 --> 00:10:14,620
In short, Saudi Arabia was on the path towards fiscal collapse.

133
00:10:14,620 --> 00:10:20,700
This attracted attention—most importantly, that of Mohammed bin Salman.

134
00:10:20,700 --> 00:10:26,300
Marking the first major move on his rise towards de facto ruler, MBS took on the country's

135
00:10:26,300 --> 00:10:28,220
biggest challenge ever.

136
00:10:28,220 --> 00:10:33,860
He fulfilled his reputation as a reformer, and plotted a path to transform Saudi Arabia.

137
00:10:33,860 --> 00:10:37,460
It was called Vision 2030.

138
00:10:37,460 --> 00:10:41,780
According to this plan, transforming Saudi Arabia into a sustainable nation involved

139
00:10:41,780 --> 00:10:48,680
three primary objectives—improve the government, the economy, and society.

140
00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:53,540
That first pillar, government, was perhaps the broadest in scope, ranging between decreasing

141
00:10:53,540 --> 00:10:59,220
corruption, stripping down bureaucracy, moving government services online, and far more.

142
00:10:59,220 --> 00:11:03,620
Perhaps the most dramatic manifestation of this mission occurred mere months after MBS's

143
00:11:03,620 --> 00:11:08,060
promotion at Crown Prince, when some 500 government ministers, businesspeople, and

144
00:11:08,060 --> 00:11:12,700
royal family members were rounded up and detained in the Ritz-Carlton Hotel in Riyadh until

145
00:11:12,700 --> 00:11:14,800
they could stand trial for corruption.

146
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:20,180
The degree to which this crackdown was legitimate is up for debate, but it did net the government

147
00:11:20,180 --> 00:11:25,860
a hefty $170 billion in assets in the ensuing settlement deals.

148
00:11:25,860 --> 00:11:30,980
The second pillar, related to economic reform, was also composed of a broad collection of

149
00:11:30,980 --> 00:11:35,220
initiatives, including privatizing certain government services, increasing participation

150
00:11:35,220 --> 00:11:40,000
among women in the workforce, attracting increased investment in the country by foreign companies,

151
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:43,640
recharging government coffers, and growing private sector industries.

152
00:11:43,640 --> 00:11:48,900
In addition, in a country known for its prohibition of all but religious tourists, Saudi Arabia

153
00:11:48,900 --> 00:11:55,340
would now allow and embrace foreign visitors—taking a page from the UAE's Economic Diversification

154
00:11:55,340 --> 00:11:56,420
playbook.

155
00:11:56,420 --> 00:12:01,220
Of course, to make tourism work, one needs a place that tourists want to go, and that's

156
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:06,220
a key focus of the third and final pillar—improving society.

157
00:12:06,220 --> 00:12:12,860
Now, Saudi society has long been defined by a strict interpretation of Islamic principles.

158
00:12:12,860 --> 00:12:17,300
Shops briefly close for each of five daily prayers, religious police roam the street

159
00:12:17,300 --> 00:12:22,660
enforcing strict dress codes, homosexual activity is punishable by execution, adult women are

160
00:12:22,660 --> 00:12:27,140
required to have a legal guardian to make decisions on their behalf, atheists are legally

161
00:12:27,140 --> 00:12:30,140
defined as terrorists, and plenty more.

162
00:12:30,140 --> 00:12:36,260
In sum, Saudi society was not one that many foreign tourists would feel comfortable visiting,

163
00:12:36,260 --> 00:12:40,900
and beyond that, considering their interpretation of Islamic principles prohibited it, there

164
00:12:40,900 --> 00:12:44,460
was little of what most foreign tourists would consider entertainment.

165
00:12:44,460 --> 00:12:48,180
Therefore, MBS went on a mission to change that.

166
00:12:48,180 --> 00:12:52,620
The country reversed a 30-year ban on movie theaters, and partnered with AMC to open dozens

167
00:12:52,620 --> 00:12:54,380
of cinemas across the country.

168
00:12:54,380 --> 00:12:58,260
It established the region's largest music festival, with artists like David Guetta,

169
00:12:58,260 --> 00:12:59,900
Steve Aoki, and Tiesto.

170
00:12:59,900 --> 00:13:04,060
It inked a deal with Six Flags to open a theme park in the country, and it gained a coveted

171
00:13:04,060 --> 00:13:09,300
spot on 2021's Formula One calendar with the first-ever Saudi Arabian Grand Prix.

172
00:13:09,300 --> 00:13:14,180
In addition, some of their most regressive social policies were abolished.

173
00:13:14,180 --> 00:13:18,060
Women were now allowed to drive, leave the country without their guardian's permission,

174
00:13:18,060 --> 00:13:21,780
watch live sports, and wear a wider variety of clothing types.

175
00:13:21,780 --> 00:13:26,720
Altogether, Saudi Arabia increasingly, on the surface, was starting to look more like

176
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:32,780
its neighbors, Bahrain, Qatar, and the UAE—countries socially and politically rooted in Islam,

177
00:13:32,780 --> 00:13:36,780
but open to elements of the increasingly globalized Western lifestyle.

178
00:13:36,780 --> 00:13:43,340
Below the surface, however, it soon became clear that far less had changed.

179
00:13:43,340 --> 00:13:50,500
On October 2nd, 2018, shortly after 1pm, journalist and Saudi dissident Jamal Khashoggi entered

180
00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:55,340
the consulate of Saudi Arabia in Istanbul, Turkey to seek necessary documentation for

181
00:13:55,340 --> 00:13:57,000
his upcoming marriage.

182
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,900
He was never seen again.

183
00:13:59,900 --> 00:14:06,700
In the days, weeks, and months that followed, it emerged that Khashoggi had been assassinated—seemingly

184
00:14:06,700 --> 00:14:11,220
in retribution for critical coverage of the Saudi government, and according to the CIA

185
00:14:11,220 --> 00:14:17,060
and other intelligence organizations, the killing was ordered directly by Mohammed bin

186
00:14:17,060 --> 00:14:18,060
Salman.

187
00:14:18,540 --> 00:14:23,460
While stifling dissent was nothing new for Saudi Arabia, the assassination of a journalist

188
00:14:23,460 --> 00:14:27,880
for a Western paper on foreign soil struck a chord with international observers that

189
00:14:27,880 --> 00:14:31,860
elicited a level of outrage unfamiliar for Saudi Arabia.

190
00:14:31,860 --> 00:14:35,940
The country was used to condemn nations by Amnesty International, critical statements

191
00:14:35,940 --> 00:14:40,120
by ministries of foreign affairs, and world news section stories about their various human

192
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:46,980
rights abuses, but never before had the country's misconduct reached front-page status globally.

193
00:14:46,980 --> 00:14:52,740
Never before had an instance of Saudi cruelty permeated into common knowledge.

194
00:14:52,740 --> 00:14:57,080
Backed up by less-covered incidents such as Saudi Arabia's alleged war crimes in Yemen,

195
00:14:57,080 --> 00:15:00,660
the hacking of Jeff Bezos' phone, who owns the Washington Post where Khashoggi's columns

196
00:15:00,660 --> 00:15:06,260
were published, and continued stifling of dissent, an informal international consensus

197
00:15:06,260 --> 00:15:07,700
was formed.

198
00:15:07,700 --> 00:15:13,460
Despite the more liberal laws, the theme parks, the music festivals, and more, deep down,

199
00:15:13,460 --> 00:15:16,660
Saudi Arabia was not reformed.

200
00:15:16,660 --> 00:15:20,320
And now, the world knew it.

201
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:22,900
This is an issue for Saudi Arabia.

202
00:15:22,900 --> 00:15:27,580
Now, when David Guetta performs in Saudi Arabia, he has to deal with a barrage of critical

203
00:15:27,580 --> 00:15:28,580
articles.

204
00:15:28,580 --> 00:15:32,540
When Formula One announces its upcoming Saudi Arabia Grand Prix, it is faced with memes

205
00:15:32,540 --> 00:15:35,360
liking it to racing in Pyongyang or Kabul.

206
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:39,540
When AMC continues with its planned expansion into the country, it encounters reputational

207
00:15:39,540 --> 00:15:43,060
damage when its competitor pulls out on ethical grounds.

208
00:15:43,060 --> 00:15:45,780
This all has a cost.

209
00:15:45,780 --> 00:15:51,480
If a business faces similar profit opportunity in both Saudi Arabia and, say, the UAE, they're

210
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:55,540
going to pick the UAE as it's been far more successful at building a friendly face for

211
00:15:55,540 --> 00:16:01,120
the West, despite an also iffy record on human rights—altogether.

212
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:07,260
These and other factors have meant that Vision 2030 is still but a vision.

213
00:16:07,260 --> 00:16:13,120
The plan laid out four key performance indicators to track the highest-level goals of the project.

214
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:17,480
The first was the percentage of the country's gross domestic product attributable to the

215
00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:22,080
private sector, rather than state-owned enterprises like Saudi Aramco.

216
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:28,360
Considering the private sector involves non-oil industries, growing it is key to diversification.

217
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:34,520
In 2016, this percentage stood at 40%, and the goal was for it to reach 65 by 2030.

218
00:16:34,520 --> 00:16:41,160
Today, over the past four financial quarters, that number stands at 42.7%.

219
00:16:41,160 --> 00:16:46,880
A crucial aspect of growing non-oil revenues involves attracting foreign direct investments.

220
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:51,440
They want, for example, an investor from Singapore to decide to open a Hilton at the new Six

221
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:53,240
Flags theme park.

222
00:16:53,240 --> 00:16:58,160
Foreign investment is key to kickstarting natural, compounding, private sector economic

223
00:16:58,160 --> 00:16:59,160
growth.

224
00:16:59,160 --> 00:17:04,820
In 2016, foreign direct investment represented 3.8% of the country's GDP, at least according

225
00:17:04,820 --> 00:17:09,960
to the Saudi government, and the goal was for it to grow to 5.7% by 2030.

226
00:17:09,960 --> 00:17:16,400
Today, according to the World Bank, foreign direct investment represents only 0.57% of

227
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:17,640
GDP.

228
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:23,600
The next indicator, non-oil exports as a percentage of overall exports, is perhaps the only glimmer

229
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:24,600
of hope.

230
00:17:24,600 --> 00:17:32,440
With a 2016 baseline of 16% and a goal of 50% by 2030, 22.4% of the country's exports

231
00:17:32,440 --> 00:17:35,060
are now non-oil products.

232
00:17:35,060 --> 00:17:39,780
This is, however, well below the pace of growth needed to reach the goal.

233
00:17:39,780 --> 00:17:46,060
Finally, the unemployment rate of Saudi nationals stood at 11.6% in 2016, and despite the goal

234
00:17:46,060 --> 00:17:52,620
of bringing it down to 7% by 2030, it has since ticked up slightly to 11.7%.

235
00:17:52,620 --> 00:17:57,900
All around, the vision of 2030 is not being realized.

236
00:17:57,900 --> 00:18:04,060
Now, of course there's been an unprecedented pandemic, of course oil prices have been low,

237
00:18:04,060 --> 00:18:09,380
and of course these are only the first years of reform, but all that notwithstanding, there's

238
00:18:09,380 --> 00:18:13,620
little evidence of deviation from the current failing path.

239
00:18:13,620 --> 00:18:17,940
A huge chunk of the government's money is being sunk into mega-development projects

240
00:18:17,940 --> 00:18:23,140
like a $500 billion planned smart city along the Red Sea, or a $3 billion entertainment

241
00:18:23,140 --> 00:18:28,560
district near Riyadh to play host to the Six Flags, Formula One track, and more, but mega-projects

242
00:18:28,560 --> 00:18:31,340
like this don't work.

243
00:18:31,340 --> 00:18:35,820
In the United Arab Emirates, flashy developments like the Burj Khalifa and the Palm Islands

244
00:18:35,820 --> 00:18:40,180
weren't what transformed the country into the most diversified economy in the region.

245
00:18:40,180 --> 00:18:45,780
It was the unglamorous, boring task of crafting a business environment that the world feels

246
00:18:45,780 --> 00:18:48,000
they can cooperate with.

247
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:52,860
Businesses want access to Saudi Arabia because it's a massive untapped market, but right

248
00:18:52,860 --> 00:18:56,340
now it's just too risky an environment for them.

249
00:18:56,340 --> 00:19:01,420
It's too risky to operate in an absolute monarchy with a track record of volatile infighting.

250
00:19:01,420 --> 00:19:06,240
It's too risky to operate in a country known for eye-catching human rights abuses at home

251
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:07,240
and abroad.

252
00:19:07,240 --> 00:19:11,100
It's too risky to operate in a country where women in the workplace have fewer rights than

253
00:19:11,100 --> 00:19:12,300
their male counterparts.

254
00:19:12,300 --> 00:19:17,320
It's too risky to operate in a country whose legal system is based on a strict yet ambiguous

255
00:19:17,320 --> 00:19:19,660
interpretation of Sharia law.

256
00:19:19,660 --> 00:19:24,940
Saudi Arabia has the riches to brute force some private sector growth.

257
00:19:24,940 --> 00:19:29,980
It has the money to lure some international investment, but as of yet, it does not have

258
00:19:29,980 --> 00:19:34,300
the vision to kickstart organic economic transformation.

259
00:19:34,300 --> 00:19:39,060
Reform so far has been superficial, but those making the decisions that matter to Saudi

260
00:19:39,060 --> 00:19:41,660
Arabia can see through that.

261
00:19:41,660 --> 00:19:47,620
Therefore, if Saudi Arabia actually wants to cement its place in 2030's world, it's

262
00:19:47,620 --> 00:19:54,860
going to have to engage in what its leaders want least—radical, fundamental, systematic

263
00:19:54,860 --> 00:19:57,820
change.

264
00:19:57,820 --> 00:20:02,420
As the story of Saudi Arabia proves so well, diversification is crucial, and this doesn't

265
00:20:02,420 --> 00:20:06,740
only apply to massive world economies, but also to you.

266
00:20:06,740 --> 00:20:10,940
Being someone who can do one thing well is great, but being someone who can do a wide

267
00:20:10,940 --> 00:20:14,780
variety of things makes you uniquely valuable and irreplaceable.

268
00:20:15,660 --> 00:20:18,020
That's why I find Skillshare so useful.
