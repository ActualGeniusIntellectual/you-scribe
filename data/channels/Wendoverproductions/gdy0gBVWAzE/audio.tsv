9880	14920	In all of World War II, the world used about 5 megatons of explosives.
14920	20960	Now this is a Trident II missile, capable of carrying 12 nuclear warheads together equivalent
20960	24680	in power to about 5 megatons of explosives.
24680	30640	A single American Ohio-class submarine can carry 24 Trident II missiles.
30640	37880	A single submarine can carry a devastating, catastrophic, inconceivable amount of firepower.
37880	42160	While in reality, due to arms reduction treaties and practicality, these boats often carry
42160	47860	far less than their maximum armament, submarines can still creep up anywhere, undetected, ready
47860	51960	to unleash their firepower, more powerful than the entire arsenal of some countries,
51960	53600	in an instant.
53600	56680	Submarines are different in purpose to some other elements of a navy.
56680	60440	While an aircraft carrier, for example, is intended to be big, foreboding, and noticeable
60440	65160	as a means to display a nation's power to the world, submarines are meant to be unseen,
65160	70360	undetected—an invisible, silent force that could, or could not, be anywhere at any given
70360	71360	time.
71360	75380	In a way, submarines almost serve a purpose of psychological warfare—an enemy can never
75380	78920	know for sure whether a submarine is looming off its shore.
78920	82740	While dozens of countries operate submarines, the most powerful and often largest of these
82740	87400	boats are those capable of firing ballistic missiles carrying nuclear warheads.
87400	93320	Only six nations are confirmed to have these submarines—the US, UK, France, India, Russia,
93320	94320	and China.
94320	97820	In addition, analysts have found evidence suggesting that North Korea and Israel also
97820	100420	each have nuclear missile capable submarines.
100420	105020	Nowadays, there are essentially two different types of military submarines with two different
105020	106020	missions.
106020	110300	The attack submarine, the more common kind, is generally smaller and, in combat, attacks
110300	114500	other close range targets like ships using torpedoes, shorter range missiles, and other
114500	115500	armaments.
115500	119220	The other, often larger, type of submarine are those ballistic missile submarines which
119220	123980	essentially serve the purpose of being a mobile, hidden launch platform for nuclear missiles.
123980	128620	The idea is that, as a stealth launch platform, a country's submarines would survive any
128620	133080	nuclear first strike and therefore be able to retaliate against an aggressor.
133080	137900	Ballistic missile submarines are therefore critical to the idea of mutually assured destruction—if
137900	141500	anyone attacked with nuclear weapons, assuming those attacked had nuclear weapons that would
141500	146860	survive a strike and they retaliated, both the attacker and those attacked would be destroyed.
146860	150900	Therefore, many consider these nuclear missile equipped submarines to actually be a form
150900	155140	of nuclear deterrence—they say they reduce the likelihood of others using nukes since
155140	157620	they assure their subsequent destruction.
157620	161460	Considering that these submarines might survive when a country and government do not, they
161460	164860	therefore need the independent authority to use their missiles.
164860	168260	While other operators likely have similar setups, it's noted that the UK's four
168260	172280	ballistic missile submarines each have a letter locked in a safe instructing their commander
172280	175940	on what to do if the UK is wiped out by a nuclear strike.
175940	179940	These letters are written by each prime minister at the beginning of their term and destroyed,
179940	181460	unread, at the end.
181460	185540	Each PM essentially has to choose which of the four potential options they want to instruct
185540	189740	their sub-commanders to do—nothing, to place themselves under the command of an ally like
189740	194300	the US or Australia, for the commander to use their judgement, or to retaliate and launch
194300	196380	nuclear missiles at the attacker.
196380	200700	Of course, what gives submarines their stealth is the blanket of water.
200700	205220	American Ohio-class submarines are publicly known to be able to go down as deep as 800
205220	207220	feet or 250 meters.
207220	210660	In reality, it is believed they can go much further.
210660	215500	As soon as a sub surfaces, though, their stealth is lost especially in today's era of satellite
215500	216500	tracking.
216500	219980	Therefore, it is important that submarines can stay underwater for long periods so that
219980	224780	they can dive underwater on one side of the world and make their way to the other undetected.
224780	228940	Of course, almost all of the world's ballistic missile-equipped submarines are nuclear-powered
228940	231920	meaning they have virtually unlimited range.
231920	235900	These boats' reactor cores only need to be swapped every few decades.
235900	240620	In addition, most submarines have oxygen generators and desalinators so, like nuclear-powered
240620	244500	aircraft carriers, the only thing that really limits how long they can stay deployed is
244500	246000	their food supply.
246040	250240	The way it works on American nuclear subs, which work similarly to those of other countries,
250240	255800	is that each boat has two fully staffed crews at any given time—the Blue and Gold crews.
255800	260920	The Blue crew will first man the boat while on patrol which lasts, on average, 77 days.
260920	264560	The different submarines' different patrols are scheduled so that there are always submarines
264560	265560	deployed.
265560	269280	Despite this long patrol period, in the US Navy at least, submarines are actually known
269280	272020	to have the best food of any vessel.
272020	276760	Some say it's because submarines are small—the chef has nowhere to hide if a meal is bad.
276760	280800	It more likely has to do with the fact that submarines get a higher food budget than other
280800	281800	vessels.
281800	285860	Food is important to morale especially considering submarine duty is one of the Navy's toughest
285860	286860	jobs.
286860	292140	Of course, fresh food can only last, at most, two weeks so the meal quality deteriorates
292140	293460	as the weeks go by.
293460	297180	Eventually, the only ingredients left are canned, dried, or frozen.
297180	301220	The sign of food quality deteriorating does mean that the end of patrol is coming at which
301220	305060	time the first crew, the Blue crew, would take the boat back to either its home port
305060	306980	or an allied overseas port.
306980	311700	The Gold crew will then arrive and then both crews will work to complete a turnover, restocking,
311700	313860	and maintenance period of 25 days.
313860	318360	Then, the Blue crew will fly home for vacation and subsequent training before the cycle repeats
318360	319360	again.
319360	323020	Most crew members will keep this cycle going for years on end.
323020	325600	Submariners even live their days in cycles as well.
325600	330420	They work eight hours on then have 16 off to train, conduct maintenance, work out, eat,
330420	331420	and sleep.
331420	337200	Now, to get a sense of the scale of the largest of the submarines, here's a Boeing 747-400
337200	339700	and here's an American, Ohio-class submarine.
339700	344620	It is almost 2.5 times longer with a hull circumference far larger than the plane's
344620	345620	fuselage.
345620	348220	But even this is not the world's largest submarine.
348220	353040	That title goes to the slightly longer and far wider Russian Typhoon-class submarine.
353040	357600	These are so large that their amenities include a sauna and small pool.
357600	361360	On American and most other submarines, the amenities are more lacking though.
361360	365320	It's important that submariners have things to do in their downtime considering they'll
365320	370600	spend three months without sunlight in a metal tube, but there just isn't much space.
370600	374720	The mess is really the only open space not devoted to work.
374720	378920	Submarines tend to have gym equipment, but it's not usually consolidated in one room.
378920	381960	More often it's just spread out in different nooks and crannies.
381960	387840	On large Ohio-class submarines, a submariner's tiny bunk is their only true personal space.
387840	392800	On smaller submarines, like the American Virginia-class, the number of sailors exceeds the number of
392800	397040	bunks so that most junior sailors have to share bunks while one works, the other sleeps,
397040	400640	and vice versa, and there's no true personal space.
400640	404680	Compared to many surface Navy ships, which have phones, frequent mail deliveries, and
404680	409180	even internet, communication to the outside world is limited on submarines.
409180	413100	Each submariner is given an email address that their family can send messages to.
413100	418220	When the submarine is able to receive communications, all these messages are then sent electronically.
418220	421620	Onboard, the messages are all reviewed by a dedicated crew member.
421620	425240	They check through to be sure that no information is being sent that they don't want known
425240	426340	by the sailor.
426340	430340	For example, they might choose to not pass on information of a family death in order
430340	431900	to not affect crew morale.
431900	435940	There's no way to get sailors off anyways so many believe it's better to leave that
435940	437980	news for the end of the patrol.
437980	443860	How submarines communicate, though, is complicated because they do, of course, spend months underwater.
443860	448160	Almost all radio waves can't travel through saltwater but submarines do need communications
448160	450000	to receive orders.
450000	454180	Very low frequency radio waves, though, do penetrate water to an extent.
454180	459160	That's why VLF radio forms the core of submarine communications systems.
459160	461460	Different navies have large VLF transmitters.
461460	466140	For example, the US has ones in Maine, Washington, Hawaii, and elsewhere, India has one on the
466140	469520	southern coast, and Australia has one in Western Australia.
469520	473780	These VLF signals are able to penetrate the ocean and be picked up by a submarine as deep
473780	476100	as 60 feet or 20 meters.
476100	480740	One major disadvantage of VLF, though, is that it is very low bandwidth.
480740	485980	It can't even transmit real-time audio signals—the most it can do is about 700 words per minute
485980	486980	in text.
486980	491300	When deeper, some submarines also have the capability to launch buoys to shallower depths
491300	493080	to receive signals.
493080	496480	Submarines also typically can't respond with VLF frequencies since they don't have
496480	500040	large enough transmitters so they have to raise to shallower depths so they can have
500040	502240	antennas sticking out of the water to respond.
502240	506440	It's at this depth that modern submarines will often have quick transmissions with satellites
506440	508980	in order to download and upload information.
508980	513480	There are a few other techniques used less commonly, some new technologies under development,
513480	517160	and some separate systems designed for use when the main systems are compromised, but
517160	520800	VLF radio forms the bulk of communications with most submarines.
521240	525520	But the fact that submarines spend their time underwater in stealth also makes another crucial
525520	528000	element difficult—navigation.
528000	532040	Both GPS and radar don't work underwater since they use higher frequency waves that
532040	534640	can't make their way through any depth of water.
534640	538360	What does work underwater is sonar where the submarine essentially generates a sound and
538360	542600	then listens to when and how the sound comes back to map out its surroundings, but emitting
542600	545960	this sound makes it quite easy for others to track a submarine.
545960	550480	Therefore, when operating in stealth conditions, submarines can't use active sonar.
550480	554000	Rather, they use an inertial navigation system.
554000	558160	These are essentially systems of accelerometers and gyroscopes that take the last known accurate
558160	562880	GPS position of a submarine and then tracks the submarine's movements relative to that.
562880	567240	It uses this to estimate position, but of course, as time goes on from the last reliable
567240	570040	reading, the accuracy of this system diminishes.
570120	576840	24 hours after the last reading, these will drift to only about 1.15 miles or 1.85 kilometers
576840	577840	of accuracy.
577840	581880	Now, this technique combined with the consultation of maps is usually fine since most of the
581880	585920	time the ocean is a big, wide-open space, but there are a few objects floating below
585920	589480	the surface that submarines could collide with—submarines.
589480	593680	Some modern submarines are so well-cloaked that another submarine, just feet away, might
593680	595200	not be able to detect it.
595200	599960	That's what happened on the night of February 3rd, 2009 when the British Navy's HMS Vanguard
599960	604320	submarine felt a resounding bump while sailing in the East Atlantic Ocean.
604320	608840	It had collided with the French submarine Le Triomphant seemingly just by chance.
608840	613360	Luckily, they were going at low speed and there were no injuries but, considering both
613360	617240	these subs were both equipped with nuclear warheads, one can only imagine the potential
617240	620360	consequences of a more damaging collision.
620360	622720	Submarines are dangerous, even in peacetime.
622720	629940	They are designed to disappear so, after something does go wrong, they often do just disappear.
629940	633760	Many submarine-operating countries have rescue submarines that can hypothetically be used
633760	637860	to save stranded submariners by going down, latching on, and shuttling sailors to the
637860	642420	surface but, in practice, these have never really had much action.
642420	647740	Sometimes submarines sink, their systems fail, and nobody can get to them before oxygen runs
647740	648740	out.
648740	653260	As submarines become better at masking themselves, submarine tracking technology is simultaneously
653260	654260	advancing.
654260	657900	There's some thought that there will be a time when nothing can hide in the ocean's
657900	662740	cliffs but until then, submarines are a crucial aspect of any modern navy.
662740	667820	Nowadays, just as they were in World War II, even traditional, non-ballistic missile submarines
667820	671100	and their torpedoes are effective and deadly.
671100	675580	One of the best ways to track submarines is also by sonar-equipped submarines so it's
675580	679620	a situation where countries need submarines because others have submarines.
679620	685220	That's why there are still hundreds of them somewhere, or rather anywhere, ready to strike
685220	687660	at any moment.
