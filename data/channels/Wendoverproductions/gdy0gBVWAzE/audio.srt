00:00:09,880 --> 00:00:14,920
In all of World War II, the world used about 5 megatons of explosives.

5
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:20,960
Now this is a Trident II missile, capable of carrying 12 nuclear warheads together equivalent

6
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:24,680
in power to about 5 megatons of explosives.

7
00:00:24,680 --> 00:00:30,640
A single American Ohio-class submarine can carry 24 Trident II missiles.

8
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:37,880
A single submarine can carry a devastating, catastrophic, inconceivable amount of firepower.

9
00:00:37,880 --> 00:00:42,160
While in reality, due to arms reduction treaties and practicality, these boats often carry

10
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:47,860
far less than their maximum armament, submarines can still creep up anywhere, undetected, ready

11
00:00:47,860 --> 00:00:51,960
to unleash their firepower, more powerful than the entire arsenal of some countries,

12
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:53,600
in an instant.

13
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:56,680
Submarines are different in purpose to some other elements of a navy.

14
00:00:56,680 --> 00:01:00,440
While an aircraft carrier, for example, is intended to be big, foreboding, and noticeable

15
00:01:00,440 --> 00:01:05,160
as a means to display a nation's power to the world, submarines are meant to be unseen,

16
00:01:05,160 --> 00:01:10,360
undetected—an invisible, silent force that could, or could not, be anywhere at any given

17
00:01:10,360 --> 00:01:11,360
time.

18
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:15,380
In a way, submarines almost serve a purpose of psychological warfare—an enemy can never

19
00:01:15,380 --> 00:01:18,920
know for sure whether a submarine is looming off its shore.

20
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:22,740
While dozens of countries operate submarines, the most powerful and often largest of these

21
00:01:22,740 --> 00:01:27,400
boats are those capable of firing ballistic missiles carrying nuclear warheads.

22
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:33,320
Only six nations are confirmed to have these submarines—the US, UK, France, India, Russia,

23
00:01:33,320 --> 00:01:34,320
and China.

24
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:37,820
In addition, analysts have found evidence suggesting that North Korea and Israel also

25
00:01:37,820 --> 00:01:40,420
each have nuclear missile capable submarines.

26
00:01:40,420 --> 00:01:45,020
Nowadays, there are essentially two different types of military submarines with two different

27
00:01:45,020 --> 00:01:46,020
missions.

28
00:01:46,020 --> 00:01:50,300
The attack submarine, the more common kind, is generally smaller and, in combat, attacks

29
00:01:50,300 --> 00:01:54,500
other close range targets like ships using torpedoes, shorter range missiles, and other

30
00:01:54,500 --> 00:01:55,500
armaments.

31
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:59,220
The other, often larger, type of submarine are those ballistic missile submarines which

32
00:01:59,220 --> 00:02:03,980
essentially serve the purpose of being a mobile, hidden launch platform for nuclear missiles.

33
00:02:03,980 --> 00:02:08,620
The idea is that, as a stealth launch platform, a country's submarines would survive any

34
00:02:08,620 --> 00:02:13,080
nuclear first strike and therefore be able to retaliate against an aggressor.

35
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:17,900
Ballistic missile submarines are therefore critical to the idea of mutually assured destruction—if

36
00:02:17,900 --> 00:02:21,500
anyone attacked with nuclear weapons, assuming those attacked had nuclear weapons that would

37
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:26,860
survive a strike and they retaliated, both the attacker and those attacked would be destroyed.

38
00:02:26,860 --> 00:02:30,900
Therefore, many consider these nuclear missile equipped submarines to actually be a form

39
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:35,140
of nuclear deterrence—they say they reduce the likelihood of others using nukes since

40
00:02:35,140 --> 00:02:37,620
they assure their subsequent destruction.

41
00:02:37,620 --> 00:02:41,460
Considering that these submarines might survive when a country and government do not, they

42
00:02:41,460 --> 00:02:44,860
therefore need the independent authority to use their missiles.

43
00:02:44,860 --> 00:02:48,260
While other operators likely have similar setups, it's noted that the UK's four

44
00:02:48,260 --> 00:02:52,280
ballistic missile submarines each have a letter locked in a safe instructing their commander

45
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:55,940
on what to do if the UK is wiped out by a nuclear strike.

46
00:02:55,940 --> 00:02:59,940
These letters are written by each prime minister at the beginning of their term and destroyed,

47
00:02:59,940 --> 00:03:01,460
unread, at the end.

48
00:03:01,460 --> 00:03:05,540
Each PM essentially has to choose which of the four potential options they want to instruct

49
00:03:05,540 --> 00:03:09,740
their sub-commanders to do—nothing, to place themselves under the command of an ally like

50
00:03:09,740 --> 00:03:14,300
the US or Australia, for the commander to use their judgement, or to retaliate and launch

51
00:03:14,300 --> 00:03:16,380
nuclear missiles at the attacker.

52
00:03:16,380 --> 00:03:20,700
Of course, what gives submarines their stealth is the blanket of water.

53
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:25,220
American Ohio-class submarines are publicly known to be able to go down as deep as 800

54
00:03:25,220 --> 00:03:27,220
feet or 250 meters.

55
00:03:27,220 --> 00:03:30,660
In reality, it is believed they can go much further.

56
00:03:30,660 --> 00:03:35,500
As soon as a sub surfaces, though, their stealth is lost especially in today's era of satellite

57
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:36,500
tracking.

58
00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:39,980
Therefore, it is important that submarines can stay underwater for long periods so that

59
00:03:39,980 --> 00:03:44,780
they can dive underwater on one side of the world and make their way to the other undetected.

60
00:03:44,780 --> 00:03:48,940
Of course, almost all of the world's ballistic missile-equipped submarines are nuclear-powered

61
00:03:48,940 --> 00:03:51,920
meaning they have virtually unlimited range.

62
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:55,900
These boats' reactor cores only need to be swapped every few decades.

63
00:03:55,900 --> 00:04:00,620
In addition, most submarines have oxygen generators and desalinators so, like nuclear-powered

64
00:04:00,620 --> 00:04:04,500
aircraft carriers, the only thing that really limits how long they can stay deployed is

65
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:06,000
their food supply.

66
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:10,240
The way it works on American nuclear subs, which work similarly to those of other countries,

67
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:15,800
is that each boat has two fully staffed crews at any given time—the Blue and Gold crews.

68
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:20,920
The Blue crew will first man the boat while on patrol which lasts, on average, 77 days.

69
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:24,560
The different submarines' different patrols are scheduled so that there are always submarines

70
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:25,560
deployed.

71
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:29,280
Despite this long patrol period, in the US Navy at least, submarines are actually known

72
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:32,020
to have the best food of any vessel.

73
00:04:32,020 --> 00:04:36,760
Some say it's because submarines are small—the chef has nowhere to hide if a meal is bad.

74
00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:40,800
It more likely has to do with the fact that submarines get a higher food budget than other

75
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:41,800
vessels.

76
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:45,860
Food is important to morale especially considering submarine duty is one of the Navy's toughest

77
00:04:45,860 --> 00:04:46,860
jobs.

78
00:04:46,860 --> 00:04:52,140
Of course, fresh food can only last, at most, two weeks so the meal quality deteriorates

79
00:04:52,140 --> 00:04:53,460
as the weeks go by.

80
00:04:53,460 --> 00:04:57,180
Eventually, the only ingredients left are canned, dried, or frozen.

81
00:04:57,180 --> 00:05:01,220
The sign of food quality deteriorating does mean that the end of patrol is coming at which

82
00:05:01,220 --> 00:05:05,060
time the first crew, the Blue crew, would take the boat back to either its home port

83
00:05:05,060 --> 00:05:06,980
or an allied overseas port.

84
00:05:06,980 --> 00:05:11,700
The Gold crew will then arrive and then both crews will work to complete a turnover, restocking,

85
00:05:11,700 --> 00:05:13,860
and maintenance period of 25 days.

86
00:05:13,860 --> 00:05:18,360
Then, the Blue crew will fly home for vacation and subsequent training before the cycle repeats

87
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:19,360
again.

88
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:23,020
Most crew members will keep this cycle going for years on end.

89
00:05:23,020 --> 00:05:25,600
Submariners even live their days in cycles as well.

90
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:30,420
They work eight hours on then have 16 off to train, conduct maintenance, work out, eat,

91
00:05:30,420 --> 00:05:31,420
and sleep.

92
00:05:31,420 --> 00:05:37,200
Now, to get a sense of the scale of the largest of the submarines, here's a Boeing 747-400

93
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:39,700
and here's an American, Ohio-class submarine.

94
00:05:39,700 --> 00:05:44,620
It is almost 2.5 times longer with a hull circumference far larger than the plane's

95
00:05:44,620 --> 00:05:45,620
fuselage.

96
00:05:45,620 --> 00:05:48,220
But even this is not the world's largest submarine.

97
00:05:48,220 --> 00:05:53,040
That title goes to the slightly longer and far wider Russian Typhoon-class submarine.

98
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:57,600
These are so large that their amenities include a sauna and small pool.

99
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:01,360
On American and most other submarines, the amenities are more lacking though.

100
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:05,320
It's important that submariners have things to do in their downtime considering they'll

101
00:06:05,320 --> 00:06:10,600
spend three months without sunlight in a metal tube, but there just isn't much space.

102
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:14,720
The mess is really the only open space not devoted to work.

103
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:18,920
Submarines tend to have gym equipment, but it's not usually consolidated in one room.

104
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:21,960
More often it's just spread out in different nooks and crannies.

105
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:27,840
On large Ohio-class submarines, a submariner's tiny bunk is their only true personal space.

106
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:32,800
On smaller submarines, like the American Virginia-class, the number of sailors exceeds the number of

107
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:37,040
bunks so that most junior sailors have to share bunks while one works, the other sleeps,

108
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:40,640
and vice versa, and there's no true personal space.

109
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:44,680
Compared to many surface Navy ships, which have phones, frequent mail deliveries, and

110
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:49,180
even internet, communication to the outside world is limited on submarines.

111
00:06:49,180 --> 00:06:53,100
Each submariner is given an email address that their family can send messages to.

112
00:06:53,100 --> 00:06:58,220
When the submarine is able to receive communications, all these messages are then sent electronically.

113
00:06:58,220 --> 00:07:01,620
Onboard, the messages are all reviewed by a dedicated crew member.

114
00:07:01,620 --> 00:07:05,240
They check through to be sure that no information is being sent that they don't want known

115
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:06,340
by the sailor.

116
00:07:06,340 --> 00:07:10,340
For example, they might choose to not pass on information of a family death in order

117
00:07:10,340 --> 00:07:11,900
to not affect crew morale.

118
00:07:11,900 --> 00:07:15,940
There's no way to get sailors off anyways so many believe it's better to leave that

119
00:07:15,940 --> 00:07:17,980
news for the end of the patrol.

120
00:07:17,980 --> 00:07:23,860
How submarines communicate, though, is complicated because they do, of course, spend months underwater.

121
00:07:23,860 --> 00:07:28,160
Almost all radio waves can't travel through saltwater but submarines do need communications

122
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:30,000
to receive orders.

123
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:34,180
Very low frequency radio waves, though, do penetrate water to an extent.

124
00:07:34,180 --> 00:07:39,160
That's why VLF radio forms the core of submarine communications systems.

125
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:41,460
Different navies have large VLF transmitters.

126
00:07:41,460 --> 00:07:46,140
For example, the US has ones in Maine, Washington, Hawaii, and elsewhere, India has one on the

127
00:07:46,140 --> 00:07:49,520
southern coast, and Australia has one in Western Australia.

128
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:53,780
These VLF signals are able to penetrate the ocean and be picked up by a submarine as deep

129
00:07:53,780 --> 00:07:56,100
as 60 feet or 20 meters.

130
00:07:56,100 --> 00:08:00,740
One major disadvantage of VLF, though, is that it is very low bandwidth.

131
00:08:00,740 --> 00:08:05,980
It can't even transmit real-time audio signals—the most it can do is about 700 words per minute

132
00:08:05,980 --> 00:08:06,980
in text.

133
00:08:06,980 --> 00:08:11,300
When deeper, some submarines also have the capability to launch buoys to shallower depths

134
00:08:11,300 --> 00:08:13,080
to receive signals.

135
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:16,480
Submarines also typically can't respond with VLF frequencies since they don't have

136
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:20,040
large enough transmitters so they have to raise to shallower depths so they can have

137
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:22,240
antennas sticking out of the water to respond.

138
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:26,440
It's at this depth that modern submarines will often have quick transmissions with satellites

139
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:28,980
in order to download and upload information.

140
00:08:28,980 --> 00:08:33,480
There are a few other techniques used less commonly, some new technologies under development,

141
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:37,160
and some separate systems designed for use when the main systems are compromised, but

142
00:08:37,160 --> 00:08:40,800
VLF radio forms the bulk of communications with most submarines.

143
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:45,520
But the fact that submarines spend their time underwater in stealth also makes another crucial

144
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:48,000
element difficult—navigation.

145
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:52,040
Both GPS and radar don't work underwater since they use higher frequency waves that

146
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:54,640
can't make their way through any depth of water.

147
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:58,360
What does work underwater is sonar where the submarine essentially generates a sound and

148
00:08:58,360 --> 00:09:02,600
then listens to when and how the sound comes back to map out its surroundings, but emitting

149
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:05,960
this sound makes it quite easy for others to track a submarine.

150
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:10,480
Therefore, when operating in stealth conditions, submarines can't use active sonar.

151
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:14,000
Rather, they use an inertial navigation system.

152
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:18,160
These are essentially systems of accelerometers and gyroscopes that take the last known accurate

153
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:22,880
GPS position of a submarine and then tracks the submarine's movements relative to that.

154
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:27,240
It uses this to estimate position, but of course, as time goes on from the last reliable

155
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:30,040
reading, the accuracy of this system diminishes.

156
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:36,840
24 hours after the last reading, these will drift to only about 1.15 miles or 1.85 kilometers

157
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:37,840
of accuracy.

158
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:41,880
Now, this technique combined with the consultation of maps is usually fine since most of the

159
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:45,920
time the ocean is a big, wide-open space, but there are a few objects floating below

160
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:49,480
the surface that submarines could collide with—submarines.

161
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:53,680
Some modern submarines are so well-cloaked that another submarine, just feet away, might

162
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:55,200
not be able to detect it.

163
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:59,960
That's what happened on the night of February 3rd, 2009 when the British Navy's HMS Vanguard

164
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:04,320
submarine felt a resounding bump while sailing in the East Atlantic Ocean.

165
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:08,840
It had collided with the French submarine Le Triomphant seemingly just by chance.

166
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:13,360
Luckily, they were going at low speed and there were no injuries but, considering both

167
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:17,240
these subs were both equipped with nuclear warheads, one can only imagine the potential

168
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:20,360
consequences of a more damaging collision.

169
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:22,720
Submarines are dangerous, even in peacetime.

170
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:29,940
They are designed to disappear so, after something does go wrong, they often do just disappear.

171
00:10:29,940 --> 00:10:33,760
Many submarine-operating countries have rescue submarines that can hypothetically be used

172
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:37,860
to save stranded submariners by going down, latching on, and shuttling sailors to the

173
00:10:37,860 --> 00:10:42,420
surface but, in practice, these have never really had much action.

174
00:10:42,420 --> 00:10:47,740
Sometimes submarines sink, their systems fail, and nobody can get to them before oxygen runs

175
00:10:47,740 --> 00:10:48,740
out.

176
00:10:48,740 --> 00:10:53,260
As submarines become better at masking themselves, submarine tracking technology is simultaneously

177
00:10:53,260 --> 00:10:54,260
advancing.

178
00:10:54,260 --> 00:10:57,900
There's some thought that there will be a time when nothing can hide in the ocean's

179
00:10:57,900 --> 00:11:02,740
cliffs but until then, submarines are a crucial aspect of any modern navy.

180
00:11:02,740 --> 00:11:07,820
Nowadays, just as they were in World War II, even traditional, non-ballistic missile submarines

181
00:11:07,820 --> 00:11:11,100
and their torpedoes are effective and deadly.

182
00:11:11,100 --> 00:11:15,580
One of the best ways to track submarines is also by sonar-equipped submarines so it's

183
00:11:15,580 --> 00:11:19,620
a situation where countries need submarines because others have submarines.

184
00:11:19,620 --> 00:11:25,220
That's why there are still hundreds of them somewhere, or rather anywhere, ready to strike

185
00:11:25,220 --> 00:11:27,660
at any moment.

186
00:11:27,660 --> 00:11:31,780
So you know those short, free moments during your day when waiting for the bus or the train

187
00:11:31,780 --> 00:11:33,580
or for an appointment or a call?

188
00:11:33,580 --> 00:11:37,660
It's hard to do anything productive during these times but Brilliant tackles this in

189
00:11:37,660 --> 00:11:39,000
a great way.

190
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:42,980
Every day, their short daily problems give you the context and framework needed to solve

191
00:11:42,980 --> 00:11:45,540
a problem and then lets you tackle it on your own.

192
00:11:45,540 --> 00:11:49,700
They publish a huge variety of problems so once you've figured one out, if you find

193
00:11:49,700 --> 00:11:52,960
it interesting, you can also try their corresponding course.

194
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:56,420
These are great ways to help learn a little more in a little time.
