00:09.880 --> 00:14.920
In all of World War II, the world used about 5 megatons of explosives.

00:14.920 --> 00:20.960
Now this is a Trident II missile, capable of carrying 12 nuclear warheads together equivalent

00:20.960 --> 00:24.680
in power to about 5 megatons of explosives.

00:24.680 --> 00:30.640
A single American Ohio-class submarine can carry 24 Trident II missiles.

00:30.640 --> 00:37.880
A single submarine can carry a devastating, catastrophic, inconceivable amount of firepower.

00:37.880 --> 00:42.160
While in reality, due to arms reduction treaties and practicality, these boats often carry

00:42.160 --> 00:47.860
far less than their maximum armament, submarines can still creep up anywhere, undetected, ready

00:47.860 --> 00:51.960
to unleash their firepower, more powerful than the entire arsenal of some countries,

00:51.960 --> 00:53.600
in an instant.

00:53.600 --> 00:56.680
Submarines are different in purpose to some other elements of a navy.

00:56.680 --> 01:00.440
While an aircraft carrier, for example, is intended to be big, foreboding, and noticeable

01:00.440 --> 01:05.160
as a means to display a nation's power to the world, submarines are meant to be unseen,

01:05.160 --> 01:10.360
undetected—an invisible, silent force that could, or could not, be anywhere at any given

01:10.360 --> 01:11.360
time.

01:11.360 --> 01:15.380
In a way, submarines almost serve a purpose of psychological warfare—an enemy can never

01:15.380 --> 01:18.920
know for sure whether a submarine is looming off its shore.

01:18.920 --> 01:22.740
While dozens of countries operate submarines, the most powerful and often largest of these

01:22.740 --> 01:27.400
boats are those capable of firing ballistic missiles carrying nuclear warheads.

01:27.400 --> 01:33.320
Only six nations are confirmed to have these submarines—the US, UK, France, India, Russia,

01:33.320 --> 01:34.320
and China.

01:34.320 --> 01:37.820
In addition, analysts have found evidence suggesting that North Korea and Israel also

01:37.820 --> 01:40.420
each have nuclear missile capable submarines.

01:40.420 --> 01:45.020
Nowadays, there are essentially two different types of military submarines with two different

01:45.020 --> 01:46.020
missions.

01:46.020 --> 01:50.300
The attack submarine, the more common kind, is generally smaller and, in combat, attacks

01:50.300 --> 01:54.500
other close range targets like ships using torpedoes, shorter range missiles, and other

01:54.500 --> 01:55.500
armaments.

01:55.500 --> 01:59.220
The other, often larger, type of submarine are those ballistic missile submarines which

01:59.220 --> 02:03.980
essentially serve the purpose of being a mobile, hidden launch platform for nuclear missiles.

02:03.980 --> 02:08.620
The idea is that, as a stealth launch platform, a country's submarines would survive any

02:08.620 --> 02:13.080
nuclear first strike and therefore be able to retaliate against an aggressor.

02:13.080 --> 02:17.900
Ballistic missile submarines are therefore critical to the idea of mutually assured destruction—if

02:17.900 --> 02:21.500
anyone attacked with nuclear weapons, assuming those attacked had nuclear weapons that would

02:21.500 --> 02:26.860
survive a strike and they retaliated, both the attacker and those attacked would be destroyed.

02:26.860 --> 02:30.900
Therefore, many consider these nuclear missile equipped submarines to actually be a form

02:30.900 --> 02:35.140
of nuclear deterrence—they say they reduce the likelihood of others using nukes since

02:35.140 --> 02:37.620
they assure their subsequent destruction.

02:37.620 --> 02:41.460
Considering that these submarines might survive when a country and government do not, they

02:41.460 --> 02:44.860
therefore need the independent authority to use their missiles.

02:44.860 --> 02:48.260
While other operators likely have similar setups, it's noted that the UK's four

02:48.260 --> 02:52.280
ballistic missile submarines each have a letter locked in a safe instructing their commander

02:52.280 --> 02:55.940
on what to do if the UK is wiped out by a nuclear strike.

02:55.940 --> 02:59.940
These letters are written by each prime minister at the beginning of their term and destroyed,

02:59.940 --> 03:01.460
unread, at the end.

03:01.460 --> 03:05.540
Each PM essentially has to choose which of the four potential options they want to instruct

03:05.540 --> 03:09.740
their sub-commanders to do—nothing, to place themselves under the command of an ally like

03:09.740 --> 03:14.300
the US or Australia, for the commander to use their judgement, or to retaliate and launch

03:14.300 --> 03:16.380
nuclear missiles at the attacker.

03:16.380 --> 03:20.700
Of course, what gives submarines their stealth is the blanket of water.

03:20.700 --> 03:25.220
American Ohio-class submarines are publicly known to be able to go down as deep as 800

03:25.220 --> 03:27.220
feet or 250 meters.

03:27.220 --> 03:30.660
In reality, it is believed they can go much further.

03:30.660 --> 03:35.500
As soon as a sub surfaces, though, their stealth is lost especially in today's era of satellite

03:35.500 --> 03:36.500
tracking.

03:36.500 --> 03:39.980
Therefore, it is important that submarines can stay underwater for long periods so that

03:39.980 --> 03:44.780
they can dive underwater on one side of the world and make their way to the other undetected.

03:44.780 --> 03:48.940
Of course, almost all of the world's ballistic missile-equipped submarines are nuclear-powered

03:48.940 --> 03:51.920
meaning they have virtually unlimited range.

03:51.920 --> 03:55.900
These boats' reactor cores only need to be swapped every few decades.

03:55.900 --> 04:00.620
In addition, most submarines have oxygen generators and desalinators so, like nuclear-powered

04:00.620 --> 04:04.500
aircraft carriers, the only thing that really limits how long they can stay deployed is

04:04.500 --> 04:06.000
their food supply.

04:06.040 --> 04:10.240
The way it works on American nuclear subs, which work similarly to those of other countries,

04:10.240 --> 04:15.800
is that each boat has two fully staffed crews at any given time—the Blue and Gold crews.

04:15.800 --> 04:20.920
The Blue crew will first man the boat while on patrol which lasts, on average, 77 days.

04:20.920 --> 04:24.560
The different submarines' different patrols are scheduled so that there are always submarines

04:24.560 --> 04:25.560
deployed.

04:25.560 --> 04:29.280
Despite this long patrol period, in the US Navy at least, submarines are actually known

04:29.280 --> 04:32.020
to have the best food of any vessel.

04:32.020 --> 04:36.760
Some say it's because submarines are small—the chef has nowhere to hide if a meal is bad.

04:36.760 --> 04:40.800
It more likely has to do with the fact that submarines get a higher food budget than other

04:40.800 --> 04:41.800
vessels.

04:41.800 --> 04:45.860
Food is important to morale especially considering submarine duty is one of the Navy's toughest

04:45.860 --> 04:46.860
jobs.

04:46.860 --> 04:52.140
Of course, fresh food can only last, at most, two weeks so the meal quality deteriorates

04:52.140 --> 04:53.460
as the weeks go by.

04:53.460 --> 04:57.180
Eventually, the only ingredients left are canned, dried, or frozen.

04:57.180 --> 05:01.220
The sign of food quality deteriorating does mean that the end of patrol is coming at which

05:01.220 --> 05:05.060
time the first crew, the Blue crew, would take the boat back to either its home port

05:05.060 --> 05:06.980
or an allied overseas port.

05:06.980 --> 05:11.700
The Gold crew will then arrive and then both crews will work to complete a turnover, restocking,

05:11.700 --> 05:13.860
and maintenance period of 25 days.

05:13.860 --> 05:18.360
Then, the Blue crew will fly home for vacation and subsequent training before the cycle repeats

05:18.360 --> 05:19.360
again.

05:19.360 --> 05:23.020
Most crew members will keep this cycle going for years on end.

05:23.020 --> 05:25.600
Submariners even live their days in cycles as well.

05:25.600 --> 05:30.420
They work eight hours on then have 16 off to train, conduct maintenance, work out, eat,

05:30.420 --> 05:31.420
and sleep.

05:31.420 --> 05:37.200
Now, to get a sense of the scale of the largest of the submarines, here's a Boeing 747-400

05:37.200 --> 05:39.700
and here's an American, Ohio-class submarine.

05:39.700 --> 05:44.620
It is almost 2.5 times longer with a hull circumference far larger than the plane's

05:44.620 --> 05:45.620
fuselage.

05:45.620 --> 05:48.220
But even this is not the world's largest submarine.

05:48.220 --> 05:53.040
That title goes to the slightly longer and far wider Russian Typhoon-class submarine.

05:53.040 --> 05:57.600
These are so large that their amenities include a sauna and small pool.

05:57.600 --> 06:01.360
On American and most other submarines, the amenities are more lacking though.

06:01.360 --> 06:05.320
It's important that submariners have things to do in their downtime considering they'll

06:05.320 --> 06:10.600
spend three months without sunlight in a metal tube, but there just isn't much space.

06:10.600 --> 06:14.720
The mess is really the only open space not devoted to work.

06:14.720 --> 06:18.920
Submarines tend to have gym equipment, but it's not usually consolidated in one room.

06:18.920 --> 06:21.960
More often it's just spread out in different nooks and crannies.

06:21.960 --> 06:27.840
On large Ohio-class submarines, a submariner's tiny bunk is their only true personal space.

06:27.840 --> 06:32.800
On smaller submarines, like the American Virginia-class, the number of sailors exceeds the number of

06:32.800 --> 06:37.040
bunks so that most junior sailors have to share bunks while one works, the other sleeps,

06:37.040 --> 06:40.640
and vice versa, and there's no true personal space.

06:40.640 --> 06:44.680
Compared to many surface Navy ships, which have phones, frequent mail deliveries, and

06:44.680 --> 06:49.180
even internet, communication to the outside world is limited on submarines.

06:49.180 --> 06:53.100
Each submariner is given an email address that their family can send messages to.

06:53.100 --> 06:58.220
When the submarine is able to receive communications, all these messages are then sent electronically.

06:58.220 --> 07:01.620
Onboard, the messages are all reviewed by a dedicated crew member.

07:01.620 --> 07:05.240
They check through to be sure that no information is being sent that they don't want known

07:05.240 --> 07:06.340
by the sailor.

07:06.340 --> 07:10.340
For example, they might choose to not pass on information of a family death in order

07:10.340 --> 07:11.900
to not affect crew morale.

07:11.900 --> 07:15.940
There's no way to get sailors off anyways so many believe it's better to leave that

07:15.940 --> 07:17.980
news for the end of the patrol.

07:17.980 --> 07:23.860
How submarines communicate, though, is complicated because they do, of course, spend months underwater.

07:23.860 --> 07:28.160
Almost all radio waves can't travel through saltwater but submarines do need communications

07:28.160 --> 07:30.000
to receive orders.

07:30.000 --> 07:34.180
Very low frequency radio waves, though, do penetrate water to an extent.

07:34.180 --> 07:39.160
That's why VLF radio forms the core of submarine communications systems.

07:39.160 --> 07:41.460
Different navies have large VLF transmitters.

07:41.460 --> 07:46.140
For example, the US has ones in Maine, Washington, Hawaii, and elsewhere, India has one on the

07:46.140 --> 07:49.520
southern coast, and Australia has one in Western Australia.

07:49.520 --> 07:53.780
These VLF signals are able to penetrate the ocean and be picked up by a submarine as deep

07:53.780 --> 07:56.100
as 60 feet or 20 meters.

07:56.100 --> 08:00.740
One major disadvantage of VLF, though, is that it is very low bandwidth.

08:00.740 --> 08:05.980
It can't even transmit real-time audio signals—the most it can do is about 700 words per minute

08:05.980 --> 08:06.980
in text.

08:06.980 --> 08:11.300
When deeper, some submarines also have the capability to launch buoys to shallower depths

08:11.300 --> 08:13.080
to receive signals.

08:13.080 --> 08:16.480
Submarines also typically can't respond with VLF frequencies since they don't have

08:16.480 --> 08:20.040
large enough transmitters so they have to raise to shallower depths so they can have

08:20.040 --> 08:22.240
antennas sticking out of the water to respond.

08:22.240 --> 08:26.440
It's at this depth that modern submarines will often have quick transmissions with satellites

08:26.440 --> 08:28.980
in order to download and upload information.

08:28.980 --> 08:33.480
There are a few other techniques used less commonly, some new technologies under development,

08:33.480 --> 08:37.160
and some separate systems designed for use when the main systems are compromised, but

08:37.160 --> 08:40.800
VLF radio forms the bulk of communications with most submarines.

08:41.240 --> 08:45.520
But the fact that submarines spend their time underwater in stealth also makes another crucial

08:45.520 --> 08:48.000
element difficult—navigation.

08:48.000 --> 08:52.040
Both GPS and radar don't work underwater since they use higher frequency waves that

08:52.040 --> 08:54.640
can't make their way through any depth of water.

08:54.640 --> 08:58.360
What does work underwater is sonar where the submarine essentially generates a sound and

08:58.360 --> 09:02.600
then listens to when and how the sound comes back to map out its surroundings, but emitting

09:02.600 --> 09:05.960
this sound makes it quite easy for others to track a submarine.

09:05.960 --> 09:10.480
Therefore, when operating in stealth conditions, submarines can't use active sonar.

09:10.480 --> 09:14.000
Rather, they use an inertial navigation system.

09:14.000 --> 09:18.160
These are essentially systems of accelerometers and gyroscopes that take the last known accurate

09:18.160 --> 09:22.880
GPS position of a submarine and then tracks the submarine's movements relative to that.

09:22.880 --> 09:27.240
It uses this to estimate position, but of course, as time goes on from the last reliable

09:27.240 --> 09:30.040
reading, the accuracy of this system diminishes.

09:30.120 --> 09:36.840
24 hours after the last reading, these will drift to only about 1.15 miles or 1.85 kilometers

09:36.840 --> 09:37.840
of accuracy.

09:37.840 --> 09:41.880
Now, this technique combined with the consultation of maps is usually fine since most of the

09:41.880 --> 09:45.920
time the ocean is a big, wide-open space, but there are a few objects floating below

09:45.920 --> 09:49.480
the surface that submarines could collide with—submarines.

09:49.480 --> 09:53.680
Some modern submarines are so well-cloaked that another submarine, just feet away, might

09:53.680 --> 09:55.200
not be able to detect it.

09:55.200 --> 09:59.960
That's what happened on the night of February 3rd, 2009 when the British Navy's HMS Vanguard

09:59.960 --> 10:04.320
submarine felt a resounding bump while sailing in the East Atlantic Ocean.

10:04.320 --> 10:08.840
It had collided with the French submarine Le Triomphant seemingly just by chance.

10:08.840 --> 10:13.360
Luckily, they were going at low speed and there were no injuries but, considering both

10:13.360 --> 10:17.240
these subs were both equipped with nuclear warheads, one can only imagine the potential

10:17.240 --> 10:20.360
consequences of a more damaging collision.

10:20.360 --> 10:22.720
Submarines are dangerous, even in peacetime.

10:22.720 --> 10:29.940
They are designed to disappear so, after something does go wrong, they often do just disappear.

10:29.940 --> 10:33.760
Many submarine-operating countries have rescue submarines that can hypothetically be used

10:33.760 --> 10:37.860
to save stranded submariners by going down, latching on, and shuttling sailors to the

10:37.860 --> 10:42.420
surface but, in practice, these have never really had much action.

10:42.420 --> 10:47.740
Sometimes submarines sink, their systems fail, and nobody can get to them before oxygen runs

10:47.740 --> 10:48.740
out.

10:48.740 --> 10:53.260
As submarines become better at masking themselves, submarine tracking technology is simultaneously

10:53.260 --> 10:54.260
advancing.

10:54.260 --> 10:57.900
There's some thought that there will be a time when nothing can hide in the ocean's

10:57.900 --> 11:02.740
cliffs but until then, submarines are a crucial aspect of any modern navy.

11:02.740 --> 11:07.820
Nowadays, just as they were in World War II, even traditional, non-ballistic missile submarines

11:07.820 --> 11:11.100
and their torpedoes are effective and deadly.

11:11.100 --> 11:15.580
One of the best ways to track submarines is also by sonar-equipped submarines so it's

11:15.580 --> 11:19.620
a situation where countries need submarines because others have submarines.

11:19.620 --> 11:25.220
That's why there are still hundreds of them somewhere, or rather anywhere, ready to strike

11:25.220 --> 11:27.660
at any moment.

11:27.660 --> 11:31.780
So you know those short, free moments during your day when waiting for the bus or the train

11:31.780 --> 11:33.580
or for an appointment or a call?

11:33.580 --> 11:37.660
It's hard to do anything productive during these times but Brilliant tackles this in

11:37.660 --> 11:39.000
