1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,480
New York is a water-scarce city.

2
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:08,620
Despite being surrounded on all sides by waterways and located in one of the rainier regions

3
00:00:08,620 --> 00:00:14,040
of America, the landscape upon which it was built lacks a significant supply of fresh

4
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:15,040
water.

5
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:19,560
To Manhattan's east, there's the East River, but its name is a misnomer—it's

6
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:20,560
not a river.

7
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:25,080
It's a tidal estuary, connecting one portion of ocean to another, letting them push and

8
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:28,780
pull undrinkable, unusable saltwater through.

9
00:00:28,780 --> 00:00:33,800
The Hudson River, to the west, does use the term correctly—it is a legitimate freshwater

10
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:38,900
river—but by the time it arrives on the shores of Manhattan, it doubles as another

11
00:00:38,900 --> 00:00:40,580
ocean estuary.

12
00:00:40,580 --> 00:00:44,680
As the tides rise, seawater pushes in against the flow.

13
00:00:44,680 --> 00:00:49,140
The river only becomes usable freshwater somewhere between the Tappan Zee Bridge and Poughkeepsie,

14
00:00:49,140 --> 00:00:51,060
depending on season and conditions.

15
00:00:51,060 --> 00:00:56,300
That's to say, the waterways that surround New York City, that make Manhattan and Staton

16
00:00:56,300 --> 00:01:01,500
and along the islands they are, are useless to quench the thirst of those living atop

17
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:02,500
them.

18
00:01:02,500 --> 00:01:06,420
It's a perpetual irony—this location, at the head of one of America's greatest

19
00:01:06,420 --> 00:01:12,100
navigable rivers, attracted more individuals and industry than any other in the country,

20
00:01:12,100 --> 00:01:18,180
but that very location is the origin of its issues in supplying its populace with water.

21
00:01:18,180 --> 00:01:22,900
Strip away the skyscrapers of today, the brownstones of yesterday, and the streets of centuries

22
00:01:22,900 --> 00:01:29,380
ago, and you have a lumpy, forested island with one major freshwater source.

23
00:01:29,380 --> 00:01:33,820
Stretching across what are now four blocks in Chinatown and extending 60 feet or 18 meters

24
00:01:33,820 --> 00:01:37,640
below the ground, it was called Collect Pond.

25
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:41,740
Some of the area's earliest indigenous villages laid on its shores, and so did some of the

26
00:01:41,740 --> 00:01:46,600
earliest European fortifications, but centuries on, after the Dutch left and the English moved

27
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:52,160
in, tanneries, breweries, and other water-hungry businesses took over these same lakefront

28
00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:53,160
lots.

29
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:57,940
For the burgeoning city, this proved problematic, as heavy use of the area's sole major water

30
00:01:57,940 --> 00:02:03,600
source made that same source unusable—the water was poisoned by the city around it,

31
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:05,360
and so were the people.

32
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:07,980
Wells were dug, but the situation was the same.

33
00:02:07,980 --> 00:02:13,720
The groundwater table beneath the grimy, gritty streets was hardly fit for human consumption.

34
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:18,180
And beyond that, Manhattan was small, and so was its watershed—it was hardly sufficient

35
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:22,460
to supply the growing population, let alone the population of today.

36
00:02:22,460 --> 00:02:29,220
New York City could no longer be self-sufficient—it needed the help of the mainland.

37
00:02:29,220 --> 00:02:34,040
If one were to hop in a car near the old Collect Pond today, go north on FDR Drive, cross the

38
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:38,520
George Washington Bridge into New Jersey, bank north on Palisades Interstate Parkway,

39
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:42,720
north again on Interstate 87, and exit at Kingston, New York, they will have driven

40
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:48,320
for two to three hours, covered 100 miles or 160 kilometers, and though far beyond city

41
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:54,160
limits, they'd find themselves within the jurisdiction of a New York City police department—just

42
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:56,320
probably not the one you've heard of.

43
00:02:56,320 --> 00:03:00,040
This is the Ashokan Reservoir, one of the most critical, and therefore most closely

44
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:03,280
monitored, pieces of New York City infrastructure.

45
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:07,940
Here, in an area that receives some 40 inches of rainfall a year, is where the city has

46
00:03:07,940 --> 00:03:13,620
stashed an impressive stockpile of water in a series of rather unimpressive-looking reservoirs.

47
00:03:13,620 --> 00:03:18,820
These six reservoirs have a staggering 460 billion gallon or 2 trillion liter storage

48
00:03:18,820 --> 00:03:24,160
capacity and catch the drainage of some 1,600 square miles or 4,000 square kilometers of

49
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:26,500
Catskill Mountain landscape.

50
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:30,580
And yet, while the size is extraordinary, and the adopted watershed's nothing short

51
00:03:30,580 --> 00:03:34,180
of essential to the city, it just doesn't look like much.

52
00:03:34,540 --> 00:03:38,780
In fact, what's so spectacular about these reservoirs is how thoroughly mundane they

53
00:03:38,780 --> 00:03:39,780
are.

54
00:03:39,780 --> 00:03:44,080
There are no massive treatment facilities, no towering protective walls, nor any Hoover

55
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:48,900
Dam-like superstructures—just a few large reservoirs surrounded mostly by forest, a

56
00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:52,600
few farms, and some quiet upstate hamlets.

57
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:57,580
This is by design—in fact, this simplicity is the system's strength, and maintaining

58
00:03:57,580 --> 00:04:02,600
such simplicity actually requires quite a lot of coordination.

59
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:07,800
Of the billions of gallons that pass through this watershed, not one goes through a filter,

60
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:13,160
making the Delaware Catskill system the largest unfiltered water supply in the US.

61
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:17,720
This distinction is a point of pride, but also the source of plenty of headaches.

62
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:21,800
In order to meet stringent national standards set by the EPA and the Clean Water Act, New

63
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:26,940
York City must monitor, protect, and prove over and over again the quality of this unfiltered

64
00:04:26,940 --> 00:04:27,940
water.

65
00:04:27,940 --> 00:04:32,540
Fortunately, the means for such heavy oversight were provided by the same 1905 state legislation

66
00:04:32,540 --> 00:04:36,120
that greenlit the Catskill-Delaware project in the first place.

67
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:40,300
Along with the reservoirs, the New York legislature also established the New York City Department

68
00:04:40,300 --> 00:04:44,500
of Environmental Protection to oversee city water, and gave the city the power to regulate

69
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:48,940
land use in the watershed so long as they provided local communities access to their

70
00:04:48,940 --> 00:04:49,940
system.

71
00:04:49,940 --> 00:04:55,480
Effectively, since 1905, New York City has had authority over what Catskill communities

72
00:04:55,480 --> 00:05:00,320
did with their land and put in the water—hence the New York City police cars two hours away

73
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:01,580
from the city.

74
00:05:01,620 --> 00:05:06,580
Today, to both ensure they meet quality standards and protect a logical terrorist target, the

75
00:05:06,580 --> 00:05:11,620
DEP staffs a 200-officer police department that patrols the watershed by car, boat, and

76
00:05:11,620 --> 00:05:15,900
even helicopter while maintaining a detective bureau and emergency service unit, but it

77
00:05:15,900 --> 00:05:19,720
takes more than a few cops patrolling reservoir borders to ensure that the unfiltered water

78
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:22,200
is safe enough for millions.

79
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:27,660
For this, the DEP employs nearly 1,000 scientists, engineers, and additional staff in the watershed

80
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:31,460
to run daily tests in the reservoirs and their tributaries, and work with nearby farmers

81
00:05:31,460 --> 00:05:35,280
and communities to limit dangerous pollutants making it into the runoff.

82
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:39,100
Every day, robotic buoys spread across the reservoirs take measurements on the water's

83
00:05:39,100 --> 00:05:43,260
turbidity, while labs run test after test to measure the presence of waterborne pathogens.

84
00:05:43,260 --> 00:05:47,940
While a tour of New York City's adopted watershed makes it seem a quaint pastoral

85
00:05:47,940 --> 00:05:52,660
landscape, these waters and the woods around them are closely monitored, heavily guarded,

86
00:05:52,660 --> 00:05:55,700
and teeming with DEP employees.

87
00:05:55,700 --> 00:06:01,220
But that pristine, clean water is of little use sitting two hours north in the Catskills.

88
00:06:01,220 --> 00:06:04,020
It has to actually get to the city.

89
00:06:04,020 --> 00:06:09,840
Now, transporting one gallon of water 120 miles or 200 kilometers is no challenge.

90
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:15,500
What is is transporting the sheer quantity that 9 million people demand.

91
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:21,500
Every minute, the city consumes roughly an Olympic-sized swimming pool's worth of water—680,000

92
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:24,580
gallons or 2.5 million liters.

93
00:06:24,580 --> 00:06:29,780
If one were to transport that quantity by semi-truck, it would take 71 of them, just

94
00:06:29,780 --> 00:06:32,020
for a minute, of consumption.

95
00:06:32,020 --> 00:06:34,840
Of course, that's not the solution.

96
00:06:34,840 --> 00:06:39,860
What is are two of the longest and largest aqueducts anywhere on earth.

97
00:06:39,860 --> 00:06:44,340
The first is called the Catskill Aqueduct, a winding miscellany of dams, tunnels, and

98
00:06:44,340 --> 00:06:50,740
siphons capable of moving some half-billion gallons of water a day, 92 miles or 148 kilometers,

99
00:06:50,740 --> 00:06:51,740
to the south.

100
00:06:51,740 --> 00:06:55,500
At the time of its opening, this aqueduct was heralded as a feat of engineering bested

101
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:58,740
only by marvels like the Panama and Suez canals.

102
00:06:58,740 --> 00:07:03,940
It was something that superpowers would boast of—built by a single city.

103
00:07:03,940 --> 00:07:05,660
But New York didn't stop there.

104
00:07:05,660 --> 00:07:11,100
Two decades on, it became clear that the ever-expanding metropolis needed yet more supply.

105
00:07:11,100 --> 00:07:19,140
So, it built one single, continuous, 85-mile, 137-kilometer tunnel.

106
00:07:19,140 --> 00:07:22,340
This was an inconceivable step forward.

107
00:07:22,340 --> 00:07:26,960
Before it, the world's longest tunnel stretched just 29 miles or 47 kilometers.

108
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:32,360
This was over three times longer, and still today, the better part of a century on maintains

109
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:35,020
the title of the world's longest.

110
00:07:35,020 --> 00:07:38,440
It enters the earth here, beneath the dam that holds back the waters of the Rondout

111
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:44,100
Reservoir, and immediately plunges some 1,000 feet or 300 meters down—puzzlingly beneath

112
00:07:44,100 --> 00:07:45,880
the elevation of New York City.

113
00:07:45,880 --> 00:07:49,860
You see, while most think of aqueducts as a network of canals, bridges, and tunnels

114
00:07:49,860 --> 00:07:54,360
slanting slightly downward, modern aqueducts rarely take this form.

115
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:57,840
There are myriad insurmountable obstacles sitting between the Catskills and New York

116
00:07:57,840 --> 00:08:02,200
City, so building a consistently downhill path with only a couple hundred feet of elevation

117
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:06,700
differential between the reservoirs and the city would be an unbelievably complex endeavor

118
00:08:06,700 --> 00:08:07,700
at this scale.

119
00:08:07,700 --> 00:08:10,700
Conveniently, however, they didn't have to.

120
00:08:10,700 --> 00:08:15,080
The Delaware Aqueduct essentially operates like one giant inverted siphon.

121
00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:19,480
Now, the physics behind how siphons work is not fully understood—there are competing

122
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:23,740
theories—but what matters is that liquid, sent through a tube, will always return to

123
00:08:23,740 --> 00:08:27,260
its source elevation, regardless of the path of that tube.

124
00:08:27,260 --> 00:08:32,320
That's to say, water will flow upward, against the force of gravity, as long as the output

125
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:34,180
of the tube sits below the input.

126
00:08:34,180 --> 00:08:38,820
Therefore, it's rather useful that the Delaware Aqueduct's origin, the Rondout Reservoir,

127
00:08:38,820 --> 00:08:45,060
sits some 545 feet or 166 meters higher than its destination, the Hillview Reservoir.

128
00:08:45,060 --> 00:08:49,520
The tunnel constantly changes elevation, avoiding obstacles, reaching its deepest point as it

129
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:52,020
passes through the bedrock below the Hudson River.

130
00:08:52,020 --> 00:08:56,500
It then rises again to connect with the West Branch Reservoir, sinks, rises, and sinks

131
00:08:56,500 --> 00:09:00,540
again, before reaching its final destination, but thanks to the principles that make siphons

132
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:04,740
work, no outside forces are needed for the Catskill Water to come out the other end—it's

133
00:09:04,740 --> 00:09:08,020
an entirely physics-driven transportation system.

134
00:09:08,020 --> 00:09:13,820
This aqueduct is incredibly efficient and effective, but also concerningly crucial.

135
00:09:13,820 --> 00:09:17,960
Nearly half a century ago, officials identified a leak in the stretch of tunnels spanning

136
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:19,420
beneath the Hudson.

137
00:09:19,460 --> 00:09:23,980
Filling tens of millions of gallons per day, the gush of water flooded nearby communities,

138
00:09:23,980 --> 00:09:27,580
and counterintuitively contaminated their drinking water supplies.

139
00:09:27,580 --> 00:09:31,380
Authorities have been mitigating and managing the issue ever since, even paying residents

140
00:09:31,380 --> 00:09:36,740
to relocate away from the impacted area, but eventually, the problem had to be fixed.

141
00:09:36,740 --> 00:09:41,140
Doing so required two decades of planning, one decade of construction, and more than

142
00:09:41,140 --> 00:09:43,780
a billion dollars in bills.

143
00:09:43,780 --> 00:09:47,620
A two-and-a-half-mile, four-kilometer diversion tunnel was built around the leakiest section,

144
00:09:47,820 --> 00:09:53,100
and in late 2023, the aqueduct will shut down for the first time in 65 years to accommodate

145
00:09:53,100 --> 00:09:56,700
the five-to-eight-month process of connecting the new section to the old.

146
00:09:56,700 --> 00:10:01,020
The shutdown was planned for winter, when water use tends to be lowest, but still, considerable

147
00:10:01,020 --> 00:10:05,040
work has gone into assuring the Catskill aqueduct can operate at full capacity, and that typically

148
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:09,400
minor water sources like the Croton aqueducts can ramp up to pick up the slack.

149
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:14,000
With essentially two big pipes supplying nearly all of the water, the risk of failure in New

150
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:18,520
York's water supply is uncharacteristically high for a city perpetually cognizant of the

151
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:23,040
worst-case scenario, but it's what's necessary to move such a quantity such a distance from

152
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:27,040
where it falls to here, the Kensico Reservoir.

153
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:31,160
While sampling up until this point gives DEP staff a good idea of what's in the water,

154
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:34,960
this is the first point where they act on that knowledge, and add to it.

155
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:38,320
This process begins at the exit tunnels of the Kensico Reservoir.

156
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:43,000
Here, chlorine is first added to kill off any lingering microorganisms.

157
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:46,660
As chlorine levels dissipate over distance traveled, though, chlorine is again mixed

158
00:10:46,660 --> 00:10:50,280
into the water supply at the nearby Hillview Reservoir, then, for water headed all the

159
00:10:50,280 --> 00:10:54,400
way to Staten Island, again at the Richmond chlorination facility.

160
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:58,640
Along with chlorine, the DEP also adds fluoride to compact cavities, orthophosphate to limit

161
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:03,020
lead leakage from pipes, and sodium hydroxide to balance the water's pH level.

162
00:11:03,020 --> 00:11:06,500
Some additives are introduced to the system at static rates, while others are added in

163
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:08,840
accordance to real-time water quality issues.

164
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:13,800
In 2005, for example, when upper-watershed rainstorms led to increased turbidity, the

165
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:17,960
DEP added the chemical compound Alum to the tainted supply as emergency treatment to lower

166
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:19,360
particle level.

167
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:24,120
Beyond additives, the DEP further fortifies its water supply here, at the Catskill, Delaware

168
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:26,560
Ultraviolet Water Treatment Plant.

169
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:31,720
Capable of treating nearly 2.3 billion gallons a day, over twice the city's daily demand,

170
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:36,160
this facility is the biggest of its kind in the world, with its 56 UV pipelines adding

171
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:38,800
another layer of defense against waterborne illnesses.

172
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:42,920
But not all of New York's water goes through this plant, nor does all of it emanate from

173
00:11:42,920 --> 00:11:45,480
the pristine, protected Catskills.

174
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:49,440
The other 10% of New York's water is still pulled from the Croton watershed, and unlike

175
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:53,120
its supply sibling, Croton water requires filtration.

176
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:57,160
Buried here below a golf course, air is added to the Croton water to float particles and

177
00:11:57,160 --> 00:12:00,760
salts through the surface for skimming, before the same chemicals and minerals are added,

178
00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:05,080
and the same UV process is employed to turn what entered as raw water into a consumable

179
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:06,080
product.

180
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:10,840
Effectively, the plant functions as a $3.2 billion dollar one-stop shop that buttresses

181
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:16,840
the Catskill, Delaware system by producing, at maximum capacity, up to 290 million gallons

182
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:18,840
of potable water a day.

183
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:23,260
New York's water supply is defined by billion-dollar projects in multiple structures deemed to

184
00:12:23,260 --> 00:12:28,520
be the longest or largest of their kind in the world, and yet the most intricate, expensive,

185
00:12:28,520 --> 00:12:32,120
and fickle stage may well be in final delivery.

186
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:35,640
Months beyond Hillview Reservoir, treated water that began its voyage months earlier

187
00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:40,040
and a hundred miles away won't see the light of day until it reaches a New Yorker's tap.

188
00:12:40,040 --> 00:12:45,220
Conveyed by tunnel, and pushed along by system pressure, it's finally headed to a consumer.

189
00:12:45,220 --> 00:12:49,280
Three tunnels supply some nine million people with treated water.

190
00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:53,040
More accurately, these tunnels get close enough to every neighborhood in every borough for

191
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:57,620
nearly 7,000 miles or 11,000 kilometers of water main lines to connect these tunnels

192
00:12:57,620 --> 00:13:01,600
with its nine million customers—filling the city's iconic wooden water towers and

193
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:04,440
pressurizing the taps in its pizzerias.

194
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:07,640
While these very tunnels and the mains that branch off them are what allowed New York

195
00:13:07,640 --> 00:13:13,360
to bloom into a true megacity across the 20th century, today they are old, leaky, and breaking

196
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:14,420
down.

197
00:13:14,420 --> 00:13:19,700
Tunnel number one was activated in 1917, number two went online in 1936, and today both are

198
00:13:19,700 --> 00:13:22,160
in need of inspection and likely repair.

199
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:26,080
As for the lines connected to the tunnels, while the DEP reported in 2020 that its mains

200
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:31,040
only experienced five breaks per 100 miles, a rate far below the national average of 25

201
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:36,440
per 100, it still reportedly costs around $400 million a year to repair all the city's

202
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:40,920
busted pipes—a process made infinitely more difficult by New York's notoriously dense

203
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:44,360
underground infrastructure—power cables to subway lines.

204
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:48,520
Additionally, because of the age and varying quality of the pipeline supplying each city

205
00:13:48,520 --> 00:13:54,160
block, the DEP has spread at 965 water testing stations around the city, where staff pull

206
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:59,120
samples each day and run over 34,000 tests each month.

207
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:01,960
Three expenses don't end there, either.

208
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:05,820
While operational, tunnel number three is still years away from completion, even though

209
00:14:05,820 --> 00:14:08,240
the project broke ground in 1970.

210
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:13,640
Sitting 600 feet or 180 meters below ground, and running 60 miles or 100 kilometers long,

211
00:14:13,640 --> 00:14:17,560
the tunnel has been called one of the most complex public works ever attempted, and will

212
00:14:17,560 --> 00:14:22,640
be the city's single largest capital project, costing around $6 billion and scheduled for

213
00:14:22,640 --> 00:14:25,180
completion in 2026.

214
00:14:25,180 --> 00:14:28,120
New York is revered for its water.

215
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:32,040
Tunnels boast about it constantly, and even claim it's the key factor behind the city's

216
00:14:32,040 --> 00:14:34,920
purportedly exceptional pizza and bagels.

217
00:14:34,920 --> 00:14:39,160
But the defining factor of the system behind it is simplicity.

218
00:14:39,160 --> 00:14:43,320
It lets nature do the work of gathering and purifying, then uses just two tunnels and

219
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:46,080
physics to transport it to the city.

220
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:52,240
Counterintuitively, however, this level of simplicity is unbelievably expensive.

221
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:56,220
Smaller cash-strapped cities have not historically had the funds to design elaborate programs

222
00:14:56,220 --> 00:15:00,300
to protect their watersheds, and build massive networks of record-setting aqueducts, leaving

223
00:15:00,300 --> 00:15:05,200
them with more marginal sources that today require more complex systems to make potable.

224
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:11,140
But beyond the money, New York City had foresight—the ability to recognize that future stability,

225
00:15:11,140 --> 00:15:16,620
growth, and success all revolved around the task, simultaneously simple and complex, of

226
00:15:16,620 --> 00:15:19,980
getting good water.

227
00:15:19,980 --> 00:15:23,300
If you want to dive deeper into the physics that make engineering marvels like the Delaware

228
00:15:23,300 --> 00:15:27,540
Aqueduct work, then I'd recommend you give our sponsor, Brilliant, a try.

229
00:15:27,540 --> 00:15:31,140
There are plenty of places where you can go to learn physics, but none are quite like

230
00:15:31,140 --> 00:15:32,340
Brilliant.

231
00:15:32,340 --> 00:15:36,180
They focus on learning by doing—you're not going to have to read long blocks of text

232
00:15:36,180 --> 00:15:38,060
and answer multiple-choice questions.

233
00:15:38,060 --> 00:15:42,100
Rather, they guide you through interactive exercises, and you learn quantum computing

234
00:15:42,100 --> 00:15:46,380
or gravitational physics or computational biology or any one of their STEM subjects

235
00:15:46,380 --> 00:15:48,420
intuitively as you go.

236
00:15:48,420 --> 00:15:51,720
It really is a better way to learn, whether you're trying to get ahead in school, brush

237
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:54,360
up on what you learned years ago, or add to your knowledge.

238
00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:58,040
Personally, I've always had a really tough time learning STEM subjects like math and

239
00:15:58,040 --> 00:16:01,600
physics—they were by far my weakest subjects in high school—but Brilliant's learning

240
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:05,680
technique has me finally understanding things that I thought I simply couldn't.

241
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:09,640
There's really nothing more satisfying than knowing something complex, and Brilliant makes

242
