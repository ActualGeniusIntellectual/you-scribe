00:00.000 --> 00:04.480
New York is a water-scarce city.

00:04.480 --> 00:08.620
Despite being surrounded on all sides by waterways and located in one of the rainier regions

00:08.620 --> 00:14.040
of America, the landscape upon which it was built lacks a significant supply of fresh

00:14.040 --> 00:15.040
water.

00:15.040 --> 00:19.560
To Manhattan's east, there's the East River, but its name is a misnomer—it's

00:19.560 --> 00:20.560
not a river.

00:20.560 --> 00:25.080
It's a tidal estuary, connecting one portion of ocean to another, letting them push and

00:25.080 --> 00:28.780
pull undrinkable, unusable saltwater through.

00:28.780 --> 00:33.800
The Hudson River, to the west, does use the term correctly—it is a legitimate freshwater

00:33.800 --> 00:38.900
river—but by the time it arrives on the shores of Manhattan, it doubles as another

00:38.900 --> 00:40.580
ocean estuary.

00:40.580 --> 00:44.680
As the tides rise, seawater pushes in against the flow.

00:44.680 --> 00:49.140
The river only becomes usable freshwater somewhere between the Tappan Zee Bridge and Poughkeepsie,

00:49.140 --> 00:51.060
depending on season and conditions.

00:51.060 --> 00:56.300
That's to say, the waterways that surround New York City, that make Manhattan and Staton

00:56.300 --> 01:01.500
and along the islands they are, are useless to quench the thirst of those living atop

01:01.500 --> 01:02.500
them.

01:02.500 --> 01:06.420
It's a perpetual irony—this location, at the head of one of America's greatest

01:06.420 --> 01:12.100
navigable rivers, attracted more individuals and industry than any other in the country,

01:12.100 --> 01:18.180
but that very location is the origin of its issues in supplying its populace with water.

01:18.180 --> 01:22.900
Strip away the skyscrapers of today, the brownstones of yesterday, and the streets of centuries

01:22.900 --> 01:29.380
ago, and you have a lumpy, forested island with one major freshwater source.

01:29.380 --> 01:33.820
Stretching across what are now four blocks in Chinatown and extending 60 feet or 18 meters

01:33.820 --> 01:37.640
below the ground, it was called Collect Pond.

01:37.640 --> 01:41.740
Some of the area's earliest indigenous villages laid on its shores, and so did some of the

01:41.740 --> 01:46.600
earliest European fortifications, but centuries on, after the Dutch left and the English moved

01:46.600 --> 01:52.160
in, tanneries, breweries, and other water-hungry businesses took over these same lakefront

01:52.160 --> 01:53.160
lots.

01:53.160 --> 01:57.940
For the burgeoning city, this proved problematic, as heavy use of the area's sole major water

01:57.940 --> 02:03.600
source made that same source unusable—the water was poisoned by the city around it,

02:03.600 --> 02:05.360
and so were the people.

02:05.360 --> 02:07.980
Wells were dug, but the situation was the same.

02:07.980 --> 02:13.720
The groundwater table beneath the grimy, gritty streets was hardly fit for human consumption.

02:13.720 --> 02:18.180
And beyond that, Manhattan was small, and so was its watershed—it was hardly sufficient

02:18.180 --> 02:22.460
to supply the growing population, let alone the population of today.

02:22.460 --> 02:29.220
New York City could no longer be self-sufficient—it needed the help of the mainland.

02:29.220 --> 02:34.040
If one were to hop in a car near the old Collect Pond today, go north on FDR Drive, cross the

02:34.040 --> 02:38.520
George Washington Bridge into New Jersey, bank north on Palisades Interstate Parkway,

02:38.520 --> 02:42.720
north again on Interstate 87, and exit at Kingston, New York, they will have driven

02:42.720 --> 02:48.320
for two to three hours, covered 100 miles or 160 kilometers, and though far beyond city

02:48.320 --> 02:54.160
limits, they'd find themselves within the jurisdiction of a New York City police department—just

02:54.160 --> 02:56.320
probably not the one you've heard of.

02:56.320 --> 03:00.040
This is the Ashokan Reservoir, one of the most critical, and therefore most closely

03:00.040 --> 03:03.280
monitored, pieces of New York City infrastructure.

03:03.280 --> 03:07.940
Here, in an area that receives some 40 inches of rainfall a year, is where the city has

03:07.940 --> 03:13.620
stashed an impressive stockpile of water in a series of rather unimpressive-looking reservoirs.

03:13.620 --> 03:18.820
These six reservoirs have a staggering 460 billion gallon or 2 trillion liter storage

03:18.820 --> 03:24.160
capacity and catch the drainage of some 1,600 square miles or 4,000 square kilometers of

03:24.160 --> 03:26.500
Catskill Mountain landscape.

03:26.500 --> 03:30.580
And yet, while the size is extraordinary, and the adopted watershed's nothing short

03:30.580 --> 03:34.180
of essential to the city, it just doesn't look like much.

03:34.540 --> 03:38.780
In fact, what's so spectacular about these reservoirs is how thoroughly mundane they

03:38.780 --> 03:39.780
are.

03:39.780 --> 03:44.080
There are no massive treatment facilities, no towering protective walls, nor any Hoover

03:44.080 --> 03:48.900
Dam-like superstructures—just a few large reservoirs surrounded mostly by forest, a

03:48.900 --> 03:52.600
few farms, and some quiet upstate hamlets.

03:52.600 --> 03:57.580
This is by design—in fact, this simplicity is the system's strength, and maintaining

03:57.580 --> 04:02.600
such simplicity actually requires quite a lot of coordination.

04:02.600 --> 04:07.800
Of the billions of gallons that pass through this watershed, not one goes through a filter,

04:07.800 --> 04:13.160
making the Delaware Catskill system the largest unfiltered water supply in the US.

04:13.160 --> 04:17.720
This distinction is a point of pride, but also the source of plenty of headaches.

04:17.720 --> 04:21.800
In order to meet stringent national standards set by the EPA and the Clean Water Act, New

04:21.800 --> 04:26.940
York City must monitor, protect, and prove over and over again the quality of this unfiltered

04:26.940 --> 04:27.940
water.

04:27.940 --> 04:32.540
Fortunately, the means for such heavy oversight were provided by the same 1905 state legislation

04:32.540 --> 04:36.120
that greenlit the Catskill-Delaware project in the first place.

04:36.120 --> 04:40.300
Along with the reservoirs, the New York legislature also established the New York City Department

04:40.300 --> 04:44.500
of Environmental Protection to oversee city water, and gave the city the power to regulate

04:44.500 --> 04:48.940
land use in the watershed so long as they provided local communities access to their

04:48.940 --> 04:49.940
system.

04:49.940 --> 04:55.480
Effectively, since 1905, New York City has had authority over what Catskill communities

04:55.480 --> 05:00.320
did with their land and put in the water—hence the New York City police cars two hours away

05:00.320 --> 05:01.580
from the city.

05:01.620 --> 05:06.580
Today, to both ensure they meet quality standards and protect a logical terrorist target, the

05:06.580 --> 05:11.620
DEP staffs a 200-officer police department that patrols the watershed by car, boat, and

05:11.620 --> 05:15.900
even helicopter while maintaining a detective bureau and emergency service unit, but it

05:15.900 --> 05:19.720
takes more than a few cops patrolling reservoir borders to ensure that the unfiltered water

05:19.720 --> 05:22.200
is safe enough for millions.

05:22.200 --> 05:27.660
For this, the DEP employs nearly 1,000 scientists, engineers, and additional staff in the watershed

05:27.660 --> 05:31.460
to run daily tests in the reservoirs and their tributaries, and work with nearby farmers

05:31.460 --> 05:35.280
and communities to limit dangerous pollutants making it into the runoff.

05:35.280 --> 05:39.100
Every day, robotic buoys spread across the reservoirs take measurements on the water's

05:39.100 --> 05:43.260
turbidity, while labs run test after test to measure the presence of waterborne pathogens.

05:43.260 --> 05:47.940
While a tour of New York City's adopted watershed makes it seem a quaint pastoral

05:47.940 --> 05:52.660
landscape, these waters and the woods around them are closely monitored, heavily guarded,

05:52.660 --> 05:55.700
and teeming with DEP employees.

05:55.700 --> 06:01.220
But that pristine, clean water is of little use sitting two hours north in the Catskills.

06:01.220 --> 06:04.020
It has to actually get to the city.

06:04.020 --> 06:09.840
Now, transporting one gallon of water 120 miles or 200 kilometers is no challenge.

06:09.840 --> 06:15.500
What is is transporting the sheer quantity that 9 million people demand.

06:15.500 --> 06:21.500
Every minute, the city consumes roughly an Olympic-sized swimming pool's worth of water—680,000

06:21.500 --> 06:24.580
gallons or 2.5 million liters.

06:24.580 --> 06:29.780
If one were to transport that quantity by semi-truck, it would take 71 of them, just

06:29.780 --> 06:32.020
for a minute, of consumption.

06:32.020 --> 06:34.840
Of course, that's not the solution.

06:34.840 --> 06:39.860
What is are two of the longest and largest aqueducts anywhere on earth.

06:39.860 --> 06:44.340
The first is called the Catskill Aqueduct, a winding miscellany of dams, tunnels, and

06:44.340 --> 06:50.740
siphons capable of moving some half-billion gallons of water a day, 92 miles or 148 kilometers,

06:50.740 --> 06:51.740
to the south.

06:51.740 --> 06:55.500
At the time of its opening, this aqueduct was heralded as a feat of engineering bested

06:55.500 --> 06:58.740
only by marvels like the Panama and Suez canals.

06:58.740 --> 07:03.940
It was something that superpowers would boast of—built by a single city.

07:03.940 --> 07:05.660
But New York didn't stop there.

07:05.660 --> 07:11.100
Two decades on, it became clear that the ever-expanding metropolis needed yet more supply.

07:11.100 --> 07:19.140
So, it built one single, continuous, 85-mile, 137-kilometer tunnel.

07:19.140 --> 07:22.340
This was an inconceivable step forward.

07:22.340 --> 07:26.960
Before it, the world's longest tunnel stretched just 29 miles or 47 kilometers.

07:26.960 --> 07:32.360
This was over three times longer, and still today, the better part of a century on maintains

07:32.360 --> 07:35.020
the title of the world's longest.

07:35.020 --> 07:38.440
It enters the earth here, beneath the dam that holds back the waters of the Rondout

07:38.440 --> 07:44.100
Reservoir, and immediately plunges some 1,000 feet or 300 meters down—puzzlingly beneath

07:44.100 --> 07:45.880
the elevation of New York City.

07:45.880 --> 07:49.860
You see, while most think of aqueducts as a network of canals, bridges, and tunnels

07:49.860 --> 07:54.360
slanting slightly downward, modern aqueducts rarely take this form.

07:54.360 --> 07:57.840
There are myriad insurmountable obstacles sitting between the Catskills and New York

07:57.840 --> 08:02.200
City, so building a consistently downhill path with only a couple hundred feet of elevation

08:02.200 --> 08:06.700
differential between the reservoirs and the city would be an unbelievably complex endeavor

08:06.700 --> 08:07.700
at this scale.

08:07.700 --> 08:10.700
Conveniently, however, they didn't have to.

08:10.700 --> 08:15.080
The Delaware Aqueduct essentially operates like one giant inverted siphon.

08:15.080 --> 08:19.480
Now, the physics behind how siphons work is not fully understood—there are competing

08:19.480 --> 08:23.740
theories—but what matters is that liquid, sent through a tube, will always return to

08:23.740 --> 08:27.260
its source elevation, regardless of the path of that tube.

08:27.260 --> 08:32.320
That's to say, water will flow upward, against the force of gravity, as long as the output

08:32.320 --> 08:34.180
of the tube sits below the input.

08:34.180 --> 08:38.820
Therefore, it's rather useful that the Delaware Aqueduct's origin, the Rondout Reservoir,

08:38.820 --> 08:45.060
sits some 545 feet or 166 meters higher than its destination, the Hillview Reservoir.

08:45.060 --> 08:49.520
The tunnel constantly changes elevation, avoiding obstacles, reaching its deepest point as it

08:49.520 --> 08:52.020
passes through the bedrock below the Hudson River.

08:52.020 --> 08:56.500
It then rises again to connect with the West Branch Reservoir, sinks, rises, and sinks

08:56.500 --> 09:00.540
again, before reaching its final destination, but thanks to the principles that make siphons

09:00.540 --> 09:04.740
work, no outside forces are needed for the Catskill Water to come out the other end—it's

09:04.740 --> 09:08.020
an entirely physics-driven transportation system.

09:08.020 --> 09:13.820
This aqueduct is incredibly efficient and effective, but also concerningly crucial.

09:13.820 --> 09:17.960
Nearly half a century ago, officials identified a leak in the stretch of tunnels spanning

09:17.960 --> 09:19.420
beneath the Hudson.

09:19.460 --> 09:23.980
Filling tens of millions of gallons per day, the gush of water flooded nearby communities,

09:23.980 --> 09:27.580
and counterintuitively contaminated their drinking water supplies.

09:27.580 --> 09:31.380
Authorities have been mitigating and managing the issue ever since, even paying residents

09:31.380 --> 09:36.740
to relocate away from the impacted area, but eventually, the problem had to be fixed.

09:36.740 --> 09:41.140
Doing so required two decades of planning, one decade of construction, and more than

09:41.140 --> 09:43.780
a billion dollars in bills.

09:43.780 --> 09:47.620
A two-and-a-half-mile, four-kilometer diversion tunnel was built around the leakiest section,

09:47.820 --> 09:53.100
and in late 2023, the aqueduct will shut down for the first time in 65 years to accommodate

09:53.100 --> 09:56.700
the five-to-eight-month process of connecting the new section to the old.

09:56.700 --> 10:01.020
The shutdown was planned for winter, when water use tends to be lowest, but still, considerable

10:01.020 --> 10:05.040
work has gone into assuring the Catskill aqueduct can operate at full capacity, and that typically

10:05.040 --> 10:09.400
minor water sources like the Croton aqueducts can ramp up to pick up the slack.

10:09.400 --> 10:14.000
With essentially two big pipes supplying nearly all of the water, the risk of failure in New

10:14.000 --> 10:18.520
York's water supply is uncharacteristically high for a city perpetually cognizant of the

10:18.520 --> 10:23.040
worst-case scenario, but it's what's necessary to move such a quantity such a distance from

10:23.040 --> 10:27.040
where it falls to here, the Kensico Reservoir.

10:27.040 --> 10:31.160
While sampling up until this point gives DEP staff a good idea of what's in the water,

10:31.160 --> 10:34.960
this is the first point where they act on that knowledge, and add to it.

10:34.960 --> 10:38.320
This process begins at the exit tunnels of the Kensico Reservoir.

10:38.320 --> 10:43.000
Here, chlorine is first added to kill off any lingering microorganisms.

10:43.000 --> 10:46.660
As chlorine levels dissipate over distance traveled, though, chlorine is again mixed

10:46.660 --> 10:50.280
into the water supply at the nearby Hillview Reservoir, then, for water headed all the

10:50.280 --> 10:54.400
way to Staten Island, again at the Richmond chlorination facility.

10:54.400 --> 10:58.640
Along with chlorine, the DEP also adds fluoride to compact cavities, orthophosphate to limit

10:58.640 --> 11:03.020
lead leakage from pipes, and sodium hydroxide to balance the water's pH level.

11:03.020 --> 11:06.500
Some additives are introduced to the system at static rates, while others are added in

11:06.500 --> 11:08.840
accordance to real-time water quality issues.

11:09.320 --> 11:13.800
In 2005, for example, when upper-watershed rainstorms led to increased turbidity, the

11:13.800 --> 11:17.960
DEP added the chemical compound Alum to the tainted supply as emergency treatment to lower

11:17.960 --> 11:19.360
particle level.

11:19.360 --> 11:24.120
Beyond additives, the DEP further fortifies its water supply here, at the Catskill, Delaware

11:24.120 --> 11:26.560
Ultraviolet Water Treatment Plant.

11:26.560 --> 11:31.720
Capable of treating nearly 2.3 billion gallons a day, over twice the city's daily demand,

11:31.720 --> 11:36.160
this facility is the biggest of its kind in the world, with its 56 UV pipelines adding

11:36.160 --> 11:38.800
another layer of defense against waterborne illnesses.

11:38.800 --> 11:42.920
But not all of New York's water goes through this plant, nor does all of it emanate from

11:42.920 --> 11:45.480
the pristine, protected Catskills.

11:45.480 --> 11:49.440
The other 10% of New York's water is still pulled from the Croton watershed, and unlike

11:49.440 --> 11:53.120
its supply sibling, Croton water requires filtration.

11:53.120 --> 11:57.160
Buried here below a golf course, air is added to the Croton water to float particles and

11:57.160 --> 12:00.760
salts through the surface for skimming, before the same chemicals and minerals are added,

12:00.760 --> 12:05.080
and the same UV process is employed to turn what entered as raw water into a consumable

12:05.080 --> 12:06.080
product.

12:06.080 --> 12:10.840
Effectively, the plant functions as a $3.2 billion dollar one-stop shop that buttresses

12:10.840 --> 12:16.840
the Catskill, Delaware system by producing, at maximum capacity, up to 290 million gallons

12:16.840 --> 12:18.840
of potable water a day.

12:18.840 --> 12:23.260
New York's water supply is defined by billion-dollar projects in multiple structures deemed to

12:23.260 --> 12:28.520
be the longest or largest of their kind in the world, and yet the most intricate, expensive,

12:28.520 --> 12:32.120
and fickle stage may well be in final delivery.

12:32.160 --> 12:35.640
Months beyond Hillview Reservoir, treated water that began its voyage months earlier

12:35.640 --> 12:40.040
and a hundred miles away won't see the light of day until it reaches a New Yorker's tap.

12:40.040 --> 12:45.220
Conveyed by tunnel, and pushed along by system pressure, it's finally headed to a consumer.

12:45.220 --> 12:49.280
Three tunnels supply some nine million people with treated water.

12:49.280 --> 12:53.040
More accurately, these tunnels get close enough to every neighborhood in every borough for

12:53.040 --> 12:57.620
nearly 7,000 miles or 11,000 kilometers of water main lines to connect these tunnels

12:57.620 --> 13:01.600
with its nine million customers—filling the city's iconic wooden water towers and

13:01.600 --> 13:04.440
pressurizing the taps in its pizzerias.

13:04.440 --> 13:07.640
While these very tunnels and the mains that branch off them are what allowed New York

13:07.640 --> 13:13.360
to bloom into a true megacity across the 20th century, today they are old, leaky, and breaking

13:13.360 --> 13:14.420
down.

13:14.420 --> 13:19.700
Tunnel number one was activated in 1917, number two went online in 1936, and today both are

13:19.700 --> 13:22.160
in need of inspection and likely repair.

13:22.160 --> 13:26.080
As for the lines connected to the tunnels, while the DEP reported in 2020 that its mains

13:26.080 --> 13:31.040
only experienced five breaks per 100 miles, a rate far below the national average of 25

13:31.040 --> 13:36.440
per 100, it still reportedly costs around $400 million a year to repair all the city's

13:36.440 --> 13:40.920
busted pipes—a process made infinitely more difficult by New York's notoriously dense

13:40.920 --> 13:44.360
underground infrastructure—power cables to subway lines.

13:44.360 --> 13:48.520
Additionally, because of the age and varying quality of the pipeline supplying each city

13:48.520 --> 13:54.160
block, the DEP has spread at 965 water testing stations around the city, where staff pull

13:54.160 --> 13:59.120
samples each day and run over 34,000 tests each month.

13:59.120 --> 14:01.960
Three expenses don't end there, either.

14:01.960 --> 14:05.820
While operational, tunnel number three is still years away from completion, even though

14:05.820 --> 14:08.240
the project broke ground in 1970.

14:08.240 --> 14:13.640
Sitting 600 feet or 180 meters below ground, and running 60 miles or 100 kilometers long,

14:13.640 --> 14:17.560
the tunnel has been called one of the most complex public works ever attempted, and will

14:17.560 --> 14:22.640
be the city's single largest capital project, costing around $6 billion and scheduled for

14:22.640 --> 14:25.180
completion in 2026.

14:25.180 --> 14:28.120
New York is revered for its water.

14:28.120 --> 14:32.040
Tunnels boast about it constantly, and even claim it's the key factor behind the city's

14:32.040 --> 14:34.920
purportedly exceptional pizza and bagels.

14:34.920 --> 14:39.160
But the defining factor of the system behind it is simplicity.

14:39.160 --> 14:43.320
It lets nature do the work of gathering and purifying, then uses just two tunnels and

14:43.320 --> 14:46.080
physics to transport it to the city.

14:46.080 --> 14:52.240
Counterintuitively, however, this level of simplicity is unbelievably expensive.

14:52.240 --> 14:56.220
Smaller cash-strapped cities have not historically had the funds to design elaborate programs

14:56.220 --> 15:00.300
to protect their watersheds, and build massive networks of record-setting aqueducts, leaving

15:00.300 --> 15:05.200
them with more marginal sources that today require more complex systems to make potable.

15:05.200 --> 15:11.140
But beyond the money, New York City had foresight—the ability to recognize that future stability,

15:11.140 --> 15:16.620
growth, and success all revolved around the task, simultaneously simple and complex, of

15:16.620 --> 15:19.980
getting good water.

15:19.980 --> 15:23.300
If you want to dive deeper into the physics that make engineering marvels like the Delaware

15:23.300 --> 15:27.540
Aqueduct work, then I'd recommend you give our sponsor, Brilliant, a try.

15:27.540 --> 15:31.140
There are plenty of places where you can go to learn physics, but none are quite like

15:31.140 --> 15:32.340
Brilliant.

15:32.340 --> 15:36.180
They focus on learning by doing—you're not going to have to read long blocks of text

15:36.180 --> 15:38.060
and answer multiple-choice questions.

15:38.060 --> 15:42.100
Rather, they guide you through interactive exercises, and you learn quantum computing

15:42.100 --> 15:46.380
or gravitational physics or computational biology or any one of their STEM subjects

15:46.380 --> 15:48.420
intuitively as you go.

15:48.420 --> 15:51.720
It really is a better way to learn, whether you're trying to get ahead in school, brush

15:51.720 --> 15:54.360
up on what you learned years ago, or add to your knowledge.

15:54.360 --> 15:58.040
Personally, I've always had a really tough time learning STEM subjects like math and

15:58.040 --> 16:01.600
physics—they were by far my weakest subjects in high school—but Brilliant's learning

16:01.600 --> 16:05.680
technique has me finally understanding things that I thought I simply couldn't.

16:05.680 --> 16:09.640
There's really nothing more satisfying than knowing something complex, and Brilliant makes

16:09.640 --> 16:14.800
that possible, especially since the first 200 people to sign up at our link, brilliant.org.wendover,
