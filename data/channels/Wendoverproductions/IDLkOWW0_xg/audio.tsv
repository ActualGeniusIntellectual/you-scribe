0	4480	New York is a water-scarce city.
4480	8620	Despite being surrounded on all sides by waterways and located in one of the rainier regions
8620	14040	of America, the landscape upon which it was built lacks a significant supply of fresh
14040	15040	water.
15040	19560	To Manhattan's east, there's the East River, but its name is a misnomer—it's
19560	20560	not a river.
20560	25080	It's a tidal estuary, connecting one portion of ocean to another, letting them push and
25080	28780	pull undrinkable, unusable saltwater through.
28780	33800	The Hudson River, to the west, does use the term correctly—it is a legitimate freshwater
33800	38900	river—but by the time it arrives on the shores of Manhattan, it doubles as another
38900	40580	ocean estuary.
40580	44680	As the tides rise, seawater pushes in against the flow.
44680	49140	The river only becomes usable freshwater somewhere between the Tappan Zee Bridge and Poughkeepsie,
49140	51060	depending on season and conditions.
51060	56300	That's to say, the waterways that surround New York City, that make Manhattan and Staton
56300	61500	and along the islands they are, are useless to quench the thirst of those living atop
61500	62500	them.
62500	66420	It's a perpetual irony—this location, at the head of one of America's greatest
66420	72100	navigable rivers, attracted more individuals and industry than any other in the country,
72100	78180	but that very location is the origin of its issues in supplying its populace with water.
78180	82900	Strip away the skyscrapers of today, the brownstones of yesterday, and the streets of centuries
82900	89380	ago, and you have a lumpy, forested island with one major freshwater source.
89380	93820	Stretching across what are now four blocks in Chinatown and extending 60 feet or 18 meters
93820	97640	below the ground, it was called Collect Pond.
97640	101740	Some of the area's earliest indigenous villages laid on its shores, and so did some of the
101740	106600	earliest European fortifications, but centuries on, after the Dutch left and the English moved
106600	112160	in, tanneries, breweries, and other water-hungry businesses took over these same lakefront
112160	113160	lots.
113160	117940	For the burgeoning city, this proved problematic, as heavy use of the area's sole major water
117940	123600	source made that same source unusable—the water was poisoned by the city around it,
123600	125360	and so were the people.
125360	127980	Wells were dug, but the situation was the same.
127980	133720	The groundwater table beneath the grimy, gritty streets was hardly fit for human consumption.
133720	138180	And beyond that, Manhattan was small, and so was its watershed—it was hardly sufficient
138180	142460	to supply the growing population, let alone the population of today.
142460	149220	New York City could no longer be self-sufficient—it needed the help of the mainland.
149220	154040	If one were to hop in a car near the old Collect Pond today, go north on FDR Drive, cross the
154040	158520	George Washington Bridge into New Jersey, bank north on Palisades Interstate Parkway,
158520	162720	north again on Interstate 87, and exit at Kingston, New York, they will have driven
162720	168320	for two to three hours, covered 100 miles or 160 kilometers, and though far beyond city
168320	174160	limits, they'd find themselves within the jurisdiction of a New York City police department—just
174160	176320	probably not the one you've heard of.
176320	180040	This is the Ashokan Reservoir, one of the most critical, and therefore most closely
180040	183280	monitored, pieces of New York City infrastructure.
183280	187940	Here, in an area that receives some 40 inches of rainfall a year, is where the city has
187940	193620	stashed an impressive stockpile of water in a series of rather unimpressive-looking reservoirs.
193620	198820	These six reservoirs have a staggering 460 billion gallon or 2 trillion liter storage
198820	204160	capacity and catch the drainage of some 1,600 square miles or 4,000 square kilometers of
204160	206500	Catskill Mountain landscape.
206500	210580	And yet, while the size is extraordinary, and the adopted watershed's nothing short
210580	214180	of essential to the city, it just doesn't look like much.
214540	218780	In fact, what's so spectacular about these reservoirs is how thoroughly mundane they
218780	219780	are.
219780	224080	There are no massive treatment facilities, no towering protective walls, nor any Hoover
224080	228900	Dam-like superstructures—just a few large reservoirs surrounded mostly by forest, a
228900	232600	few farms, and some quiet upstate hamlets.
232600	237580	This is by design—in fact, this simplicity is the system's strength, and maintaining
237580	242600	such simplicity actually requires quite a lot of coordination.
242600	247800	Of the billions of gallons that pass through this watershed, not one goes through a filter,
247800	253160	making the Delaware Catskill system the largest unfiltered water supply in the US.
253160	257720	This distinction is a point of pride, but also the source of plenty of headaches.
257720	261800	In order to meet stringent national standards set by the EPA and the Clean Water Act, New
261800	266940	York City must monitor, protect, and prove over and over again the quality of this unfiltered
266940	267940	water.
267940	272540	Fortunately, the means for such heavy oversight were provided by the same 1905 state legislation
272540	276120	that greenlit the Catskill-Delaware project in the first place.
276120	280300	Along with the reservoirs, the New York legislature also established the New York City Department
280300	284500	of Environmental Protection to oversee city water, and gave the city the power to regulate
284500	288940	land use in the watershed so long as they provided local communities access to their
288940	289940	system.
289940	295480	Effectively, since 1905, New York City has had authority over what Catskill communities
295480	300320	did with their land and put in the water—hence the New York City police cars two hours away
300320	301580	from the city.
301620	306580	Today, to both ensure they meet quality standards and protect a logical terrorist target, the
306580	311620	DEP staffs a 200-officer police department that patrols the watershed by car, boat, and
311620	315900	even helicopter while maintaining a detective bureau and emergency service unit, but it
315900	319720	takes more than a few cops patrolling reservoir borders to ensure that the unfiltered water
319720	322200	is safe enough for millions.
322200	327660	For this, the DEP employs nearly 1,000 scientists, engineers, and additional staff in the watershed
327660	331460	to run daily tests in the reservoirs and their tributaries, and work with nearby farmers
331460	335280	and communities to limit dangerous pollutants making it into the runoff.
335280	339100	Every day, robotic buoys spread across the reservoirs take measurements on the water's
339100	343260	turbidity, while labs run test after test to measure the presence of waterborne pathogens.
343260	347940	While a tour of New York City's adopted watershed makes it seem a quaint pastoral
347940	352660	landscape, these waters and the woods around them are closely monitored, heavily guarded,
352660	355700	and teeming with DEP employees.
355700	361220	But that pristine, clean water is of little use sitting two hours north in the Catskills.
361220	364020	It has to actually get to the city.
364020	369840	Now, transporting one gallon of water 120 miles or 200 kilometers is no challenge.
369840	375500	What is is transporting the sheer quantity that 9 million people demand.
375500	381500	Every minute, the city consumes roughly an Olympic-sized swimming pool's worth of water—680,000
381500	384580	gallons or 2.5 million liters.
384580	389780	If one were to transport that quantity by semi-truck, it would take 71 of them, just
389780	392020	for a minute, of consumption.
392020	394840	Of course, that's not the solution.
394840	399860	What is are two of the longest and largest aqueducts anywhere on earth.
399860	404340	The first is called the Catskill Aqueduct, a winding miscellany of dams, tunnels, and
404340	410740	siphons capable of moving some half-billion gallons of water a day, 92 miles or 148 kilometers,
410740	411740	to the south.
411740	415500	At the time of its opening, this aqueduct was heralded as a feat of engineering bested
415500	418740	only by marvels like the Panama and Suez canals.
418740	423940	It was something that superpowers would boast of—built by a single city.
423940	425660	But New York didn't stop there.
425660	431100	Two decades on, it became clear that the ever-expanding metropolis needed yet more supply.
431100	439140	So, it built one single, continuous, 85-mile, 137-kilometer tunnel.
439140	442340	This was an inconceivable step forward.
442340	446960	Before it, the world's longest tunnel stretched just 29 miles or 47 kilometers.
446960	452360	This was over three times longer, and still today, the better part of a century on maintains
452360	455020	the title of the world's longest.
455020	458440	It enters the earth here, beneath the dam that holds back the waters of the Rondout
458440	464100	Reservoir, and immediately plunges some 1,000 feet or 300 meters down—puzzlingly beneath
464100	465880	the elevation of New York City.
465880	469860	You see, while most think of aqueducts as a network of canals, bridges, and tunnels
469860	474360	slanting slightly downward, modern aqueducts rarely take this form.
474360	477840	There are myriad insurmountable obstacles sitting between the Catskills and New York
477840	482200	City, so building a consistently downhill path with only a couple hundred feet of elevation
482200	486700	differential between the reservoirs and the city would be an unbelievably complex endeavor
486700	487700	at this scale.
487700	490700	Conveniently, however, they didn't have to.
490700	495080	The Delaware Aqueduct essentially operates like one giant inverted siphon.
495080	499480	Now, the physics behind how siphons work is not fully understood—there are competing
499480	503740	theories—but what matters is that liquid, sent through a tube, will always return to
503740	507260	its source elevation, regardless of the path of that tube.
507260	512320	That's to say, water will flow upward, against the force of gravity, as long as the output
512320	514180	of the tube sits below the input.
514180	518820	Therefore, it's rather useful that the Delaware Aqueduct's origin, the Rondout Reservoir,
518820	525060	sits some 545 feet or 166 meters higher than its destination, the Hillview Reservoir.
525060	529520	The tunnel constantly changes elevation, avoiding obstacles, reaching its deepest point as it
529520	532020	passes through the bedrock below the Hudson River.
532020	536500	It then rises again to connect with the West Branch Reservoir, sinks, rises, and sinks
536500	540540	again, before reaching its final destination, but thanks to the principles that make siphons
540540	544740	work, no outside forces are needed for the Catskill Water to come out the other end—it's
544740	548020	an entirely physics-driven transportation system.
548020	553820	This aqueduct is incredibly efficient and effective, but also concerningly crucial.
553820	557960	Nearly half a century ago, officials identified a leak in the stretch of tunnels spanning
557960	559420	beneath the Hudson.
559460	563980	Filling tens of millions of gallons per day, the gush of water flooded nearby communities,
563980	567580	and counterintuitively contaminated their drinking water supplies.
567580	571380	Authorities have been mitigating and managing the issue ever since, even paying residents
571380	576740	to relocate away from the impacted area, but eventually, the problem had to be fixed.
576740	581140	Doing so required two decades of planning, one decade of construction, and more than
581140	583780	a billion dollars in bills.
583780	587620	A two-and-a-half-mile, four-kilometer diversion tunnel was built around the leakiest section,
587820	593100	and in late 2023, the aqueduct will shut down for the first time in 65 years to accommodate
593100	596700	the five-to-eight-month process of connecting the new section to the old.
596700	601020	The shutdown was planned for winter, when water use tends to be lowest, but still, considerable
601020	605040	work has gone into assuring the Catskill aqueduct can operate at full capacity, and that typically
605040	609400	minor water sources like the Croton aqueducts can ramp up to pick up the slack.
609400	614000	With essentially two big pipes supplying nearly all of the water, the risk of failure in New
614000	618520	York's water supply is uncharacteristically high for a city perpetually cognizant of the
618520	623040	worst-case scenario, but it's what's necessary to move such a quantity such a distance from
623040	627040	where it falls to here, the Kensico Reservoir.
627040	631160	While sampling up until this point gives DEP staff a good idea of what's in the water,
631160	634960	this is the first point where they act on that knowledge, and add to it.
634960	638320	This process begins at the exit tunnels of the Kensico Reservoir.
638320	643000	Here, chlorine is first added to kill off any lingering microorganisms.
643000	646660	As chlorine levels dissipate over distance traveled, though, chlorine is again mixed
646660	650280	into the water supply at the nearby Hillview Reservoir, then, for water headed all the
650280	654400	way to Staten Island, again at the Richmond chlorination facility.
654400	658640	Along with chlorine, the DEP also adds fluoride to compact cavities, orthophosphate to limit
658640	663020	lead leakage from pipes, and sodium hydroxide to balance the water's pH level.
663020	666500	Some additives are introduced to the system at static rates, while others are added in
666500	668840	accordance to real-time water quality issues.
669320	673800	In 2005, for example, when upper-watershed rainstorms led to increased turbidity, the
673800	677960	DEP added the chemical compound Alum to the tainted supply as emergency treatment to lower
677960	679360	particle level.
679360	684120	Beyond additives, the DEP further fortifies its water supply here, at the Catskill, Delaware
684120	686560	Ultraviolet Water Treatment Plant.
686560	691720	Capable of treating nearly 2.3 billion gallons a day, over twice the city's daily demand,
691720	696160	this facility is the biggest of its kind in the world, with its 56 UV pipelines adding
696160	698800	another layer of defense against waterborne illnesses.
698800	702920	But not all of New York's water goes through this plant, nor does all of it emanate from
702920	705480	the pristine, protected Catskills.
705480	709440	The other 10% of New York's water is still pulled from the Croton watershed, and unlike
709440	713120	its supply sibling, Croton water requires filtration.
713120	717160	Buried here below a golf course, air is added to the Croton water to float particles and
717160	720760	salts through the surface for skimming, before the same chemicals and minerals are added,
720760	725080	and the same UV process is employed to turn what entered as raw water into a consumable
725080	726080	product.
726080	730840	Effectively, the plant functions as a $3.2 billion dollar one-stop shop that buttresses
730840	736840	the Catskill, Delaware system by producing, at maximum capacity, up to 290 million gallons
736840	738840	of potable water a day.
738840	743260	New York's water supply is defined by billion-dollar projects in multiple structures deemed to
743260	748520	be the longest or largest of their kind in the world, and yet the most intricate, expensive,
748520	752120	and fickle stage may well be in final delivery.
752160	755640	Months beyond Hillview Reservoir, treated water that began its voyage months earlier
755640	760040	and a hundred miles away won't see the light of day until it reaches a New Yorker's tap.
760040	765220	Conveyed by tunnel, and pushed along by system pressure, it's finally headed to a consumer.
765220	769280	Three tunnels supply some nine million people with treated water.
769280	773040	More accurately, these tunnels get close enough to every neighborhood in every borough for
773040	777620	nearly 7,000 miles or 11,000 kilometers of water main lines to connect these tunnels
777620	781600	with its nine million customers—filling the city's iconic wooden water towers and
781600	784440	pressurizing the taps in its pizzerias.
784440	787640	While these very tunnels and the mains that branch off them are what allowed New York
787640	793360	to bloom into a true megacity across the 20th century, today they are old, leaky, and breaking
793360	794420	down.
794420	799700	Tunnel number one was activated in 1917, number two went online in 1936, and today both are
799700	802160	in need of inspection and likely repair.
802160	806080	As for the lines connected to the tunnels, while the DEP reported in 2020 that its mains
806080	811040	only experienced five breaks per 100 miles, a rate far below the national average of 25
811040	816440	per 100, it still reportedly costs around $400 million a year to repair all the city's
816440	820920	busted pipes—a process made infinitely more difficult by New York's notoriously dense
820920	824360	underground infrastructure—power cables to subway lines.
824360	828520	Additionally, because of the age and varying quality of the pipeline supplying each city
828520	834160	block, the DEP has spread at 965 water testing stations around the city, where staff pull
834160	839120	samples each day and run over 34,000 tests each month.
839120	841960	Three expenses don't end there, either.
841960	845820	While operational, tunnel number three is still years away from completion, even though
845820	848240	the project broke ground in 1970.
848240	853640	Sitting 600 feet or 180 meters below ground, and running 60 miles or 100 kilometers long,
853640	857560	the tunnel has been called one of the most complex public works ever attempted, and will
857560	862640	be the city's single largest capital project, costing around $6 billion and scheduled for
862640	865180	completion in 2026.
865180	868120	New York is revered for its water.
868120	872040	Tunnels boast about it constantly, and even claim it's the key factor behind the city's
872040	874920	purportedly exceptional pizza and bagels.
874920	879160	But the defining factor of the system behind it is simplicity.
879160	883320	It lets nature do the work of gathering and purifying, then uses just two tunnels and
883320	886080	physics to transport it to the city.
886080	892240	Counterintuitively, however, this level of simplicity is unbelievably expensive.
892240	896220	Smaller cash-strapped cities have not historically had the funds to design elaborate programs
896220	900300	to protect their watersheds, and build massive networks of record-setting aqueducts, leaving
900300	905200	them with more marginal sources that today require more complex systems to make potable.
905200	911140	But beyond the money, New York City had foresight—the ability to recognize that future stability,
911140	916620	growth, and success all revolved around the task, simultaneously simple and complex, of
916620	919980	getting good water.
919980	923300	If you want to dive deeper into the physics that make engineering marvels like the Delaware
923300	927540	Aqueduct work, then I'd recommend you give our sponsor, Brilliant, a try.
927540	931140	There are plenty of places where you can go to learn physics, but none are quite like
931140	932340	Brilliant.
932340	936180	They focus on learning by doing—you're not going to have to read long blocks of text
936180	938060	and answer multiple-choice questions.
938060	942100	Rather, they guide you through interactive exercises, and you learn quantum computing
942100	946380	or gravitational physics or computational biology or any one of their STEM subjects
946380	948420	intuitively as you go.
948420	951720	It really is a better way to learn, whether you're trying to get ahead in school, brush
951720	954360	up on what you learned years ago, or add to your knowledge.
954360	958040	Personally, I've always had a really tough time learning STEM subjects like math and
958040	961600	physics—they were by far my weakest subjects in high school—but Brilliant's learning
961600	965680	technique has me finally understanding things that I thought I simply couldn't.
965680	969640	There's really nothing more satisfying than knowing something complex, and Brilliant makes
