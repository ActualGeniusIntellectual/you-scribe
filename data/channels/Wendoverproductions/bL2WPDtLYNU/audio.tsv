0	4640	If we find aliens, what do we do next?
4640	9440	When discussing first contact, many are quick to point out that historically, contact between
9440	15480	culturally different civilizations has almost always led to the destruction of one of those
15480	16480	civilizations.
16480	21740	Because of this, you could argue that we should stick to ourselves, leave the aliens alone,
21740	26500	but in almost every one of those historical examples, it's the civilization that makes
26500	31020	contact that destroys the civilization that receives contact.
31020	35780	So perhaps we should go on the offensive—find the aliens before they find us.
35780	39880	Of course, we've been trying for decades to find extraterrestrial life—it's one
39880	43200	of humanity's great questions—are we alone?
43200	47940	One way we might find aliens is by looking at stars, or more specifically, the light
47940	49420	level of stars.
49420	52740	As the earth has developed, our energy consumption has skyrocketed.
52740	57060	That's just the consequence of an increasingly technologically advanced world.
57060	62220	It's suspected that this trend will continue and it's also suspected that with any alien
62220	66060	civilization, they'll also require more and more energy as they advance.
66060	70540	Eventually, any planetary civilization will reach a point where the amount of energy on
70540	74620	their planet is not enough to sustain their advancing civilization.
74620	79420	Theoretical physicist Freeman Dyson speculated that when a planetary civilization needs more
79420	83560	energy than their planet can provide, they'll turn to the sun.
83560	88220	Stars are the most abundant source of energy in any planetary system so a super-advanced
88220	93660	civilization could build a series of satellites to orbit around their sun to collect energy.
93660	98340	When sunlight travels through space, it loses energy and so the amount of energy captured
98340	104040	by a solar panel near the sun would be astronomically higher than a solar panel on earth.
104040	107940	With more energy a civilization could produce more satellites and eventually there would
107940	110420	be a swarm of satellites orbiting the sun.
110420	115740	Freeman Dyson believes that this is the most logical way that any civilization would harvest
115740	120300	the energy they need so if we search for a star with orbiting satellites, we might be
120300	123140	able to find an alien civilization.
123140	128020	No telescope is powerful enough to see the individual satellites, but we can rather easily
128020	130460	observe the light level of stars.
130460	134780	You see, once a far away civilization builds enough satellites, the swarm will start to
134780	138420	block our view of their sun as the satellites orbit.
138420	143460	From our perspective, it will look like the star is twinkling—something completely unnatural
143460	148660	so, by looking for stars with highly variable light levels, we might be able to find an
148660	152220	alien civilization harvesting the energy of their sun.
152220	159220	KIC 8462852, also known as Tabby's Star, is a star in the Cygnus constellation of the
159220	160700	Milky Way.
160700	164700	Scientists observed the light level of this star for years and they regularly came across
164700	167100	irregularities like this.
167100	171340	Maybe there are comets or a debris field obstructing our view of the star, but astronomers have
171340	175180	doubted that either of those could dip the light levels by this much.
175180	179700	This has led some to suggest that an alien civilization has built these orbiting satellites
179700	182660	around their sun, but we may never know for certain.
182660	187500	Of course all of this is somewhat speculative and it's unlikely that we'd actually find
187500	190100	a so-called Dyson sphere around a sun.
190100	194060	It's more of a thought experiment, demonstrating that we could find aliens through looking
194060	196220	for their impact on the universe.
196220	200340	Conversely, aliens might find us based on our effect on the universe.
200340	206380	That's why we very purposefully sent out messages to our hypothetical cosmic neighbors.
206380	210740	The Pioneer Plaques were designed and placed on the two Pioneer spacecrafts which were
210740	214460	the first to explore the far reaches of the solar system.
214460	218700	Since these two are some of the farthest man-made objects from earth, they were sent with a
218700	222860	message in case extraterrestrials come across the probes.
222860	225780	This is what was sent—the Pioneer Plaque.
225780	230540	It has a representation of hydrogen, the most abundant element in the universe, a picture
230540	235500	of a man and woman including a raised hand, a gesture that most likely wouldn't be understood
235500	240520	but shows how our limbs move and the existence of the opposable thumb, an image of the Pioneer
240520	246100	spacecraft behind the humans so that the extraterrestrials could figure out the rough size of humans,
246100	251700	the location of the sun relative to 14 nearby pulsar stars using hydrogen spin-flip transition
251700	256340	frequency as the unit—something far too complicated for me to explain, and lastly
256340	261460	an image of the solar system with the rough trajectory of the Pioneer spacecraft.
261460	263860	But there are issues with this image.
263860	268240	We have no idea how aliens gather information.
268240	272460	Humans are a visual species since we have relatively good vision so it's natural for
272460	275620	us to convey information through images.
275620	279900	Aliens on the other hand, could have poor or no vision and therefore no conception of
279900	285180	the idea of transferring information through images or they could interpret the symbols
285180	286700	vastly differently.
286700	290140	Perhaps the most frequently criticized aspect of the plaque is the arrow.
290140	294760	It's believed that the arrow symbol is derived from either the shape of arrows or the human
294760	298140	hand pointing, or perhaps a combination of both.
298140	303100	Aliens would most likely have neither arrows or hands and therefore no idea what this symbol
303100	304100	means.
304100	308580	They could also make the dangerous assumption that the symbol depicts a weapon launching
308580	311700	meaning that the spacecraft was sent to harm them.
311700	316580	Other sets of images have been sent with subsequent space probes, but the chance of aliens finding
316580	320620	these few tiny objects in the vastness of space is miniscule.
320620	325020	What's far more likely is that aliens will discover humanity off of something we've
325020	328940	been sending out for over a hundred years—radio signals.
328940	333140	While most are too weak to reach far away galaxies, some do travel through space and
333140	338480	could be picked up by extraterrestrial civilizations—especially more advanced ones with better detection
338480	339640	technology than us.
339640	343760	It's entirely possible that we've already unintentionally sent the signal that will
343760	346960	be our first message to an extraterrestrial civilization.
346960	351640	It's also entirely possible that the first sign we will have of extraterrestrial life
351640	353820	is a radio message from another planet.
353820	355720	The problem is then deciphering it.
355720	358720	The first step is deciding what the message even is.
358720	359720	Is it binary?
359720	360720	Is it radiation?
360720	361760	Is it natural language?
361760	362760	What is it?
362760	364140	We can figure this out.
364140	370500	In the English language, the most common word, the, accounts for about 7% of all word occurrences.
370500	375580	The second most common word, be, accounts for about 3.5% of all words.
375580	379540	Then and is about 2.3% and so on and so forth.
379540	384980	The distribution of words, it turns out, in all languages follows a logarithmic scale.
384980	389700	The second most common word occurs about half as frequently as the most common, the third
389700	394340	and third as often, the fourth one-fourth as often, the fifth one-fifth as often, and
394340	396040	so on and so forth.
396040	401220	This is somehow true for all languages, even ones with no common ancestral language, which
401220	406140	means that, more than likely, an alien language will follow the same distribution.
406140	411020	It's not entirely understood why languages follow this distribution, but one possible
411020	413740	explanation is that people are lazy.
413740	416020	It's called the principle of least effort.
416020	421020	People, animals, even machines will always pick the path of least resistance—the easiest
421020	425380	path—and in the case of language, the meaning that needs to be most frequently conveyed
425380	430140	will be attached to the most common word rather than a number of other words since that is
430140	431420	easiest.
431420	435860	That keeps happening down to the least frequent word therefore creating this distribution.
435860	440700	With an extraterrestrial transmission, if we rank the sounds by frequency and it follows
440700	445280	this distribution we can believe that it's most likely a language.
445280	448220	But then we need to try to understand the language.
448220	451340	For this, we need to drop all assumptions.
451340	456100	There are innate similarities across all human languages, mostly related to grammar.
456100	462520	For example, pretty much every language separates description words, nouns, from action words,
462520	463520	verbs.
463520	468720	Grammatically, there are huge similarities between all languages, even ones that develop
468720	469720	separately.
469720	474360	Some have suggested that this means that humans have a genetic framework for language.
474360	480040	Perhaps we are hardwired from birth to understand what nouns and verbs and sentences are and
480040	485160	learning a language is just the process of filling in and understanding that framework.
485160	490200	From everything we understand about the communication systems that animals use, they do not have
490200	492360	a universal grammar like humans.
492360	496600	We therefore have to assume that an alien language would be fundamentally different
496600	497740	than ours.
497740	500140	We don't know how they'll structure sentences.
500140	502460	We don't even know if they'll have sentences.
502460	507240	The problem is, if we just receive a natural language transmission, there's really nothing
507240	508400	we can do.
508400	513460	When deciphering ancient languages, linguists figure out meaning using context and relations
513460	518820	to other languages, but with an alien language transmission, there is no context and no other
518820	521260	similar languages to compare it with.
521260	525660	All this is assuming that aliens use a verbal language and that's a huge assumption.
525660	530340	Many, if not most, animals have no verbal communication system.
530340	534640	Cuttlefish and chameleons alter their body color to communicate while ants and honeybees
534640	537940	use pheromones to talk to other members of their species.
537940	541660	Even if we understood their language, could we understand what they're saying?
541660	543540	Take this sentence in French.
543540	546020	Translating it literally word for word gets you,
546020	550400	The Palace Bourbon is the name commonly given to the building that houses the Assembly National
550400	554380	French located on the Cay of Orsay in the seventh borough of Paris of the square of
554380	555680	the Concorde.
555680	559760	Even if you clean it up to structure it like an English sentence, how much meaning is conveyed
559760	560760	to you?
560760	563080	What exactly is the French National Assembly?
563080	564840	Where is the Cay of Orsay?
564840	566600	Where is the seventh borough?
566600	568200	Where is Concorde Square?
568200	572080	Someone familiar to Paris and France would understand what these words mean, but someone
572080	575680	from the other side of the world would infer little meaning from them.
575680	578280	Philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein famously wrote,
578280	582520	If a lion could speak, we would not be able to understand him.
582520	587120	Language is all based on cultures and requires a common frame of reference.
587120	591720	If you said, I'm taking an Uber to get some coffee at Starbucks, there's no way it would
591720	593040	understand what you're saying.
593040	597560	You'd have to explain what Uber is, then explain what a car is, what the internet is,
597560	602480	what a phone is, an app, coffee, Starbucks stores, the monetary system—all stuff that
602480	605040	is intuitive to modern humans.
605040	609520	Translating the words of an extraterrestrial civilization is just the first step.
609520	612360	Understanding what they're saying is the more difficult task.
612360	617040	Centuries or millennia after detecting aliens, we might reach a day when an extraterrestrial
617040	618760	being comes to earth.
618760	623640	If this happens, the alien civilization is almost certainly more advanced than humans
623640	628320	since it has accomplished interstellar travel and perhaps even faster than light travel,
628320	631840	but we want to show that us humans are intelligent as well.
631840	635760	Of course the ET would see everything that humans have built, but they might interpret
635760	639260	the structures of mankind as natural phenomenons.
639260	643160	We can't assume that they'd think that buildings and cars and artificial light are
643160	645840	not part of the natural structure of earth.
645840	650440	We therefore need to show them that we have at least a basic understanding of the universe.
650440	653200	Math, as far as we know, is universal.
653200	658280	No matter where you go or who you ask, two plus two is four and the ratio of a circle's
658280	663620	circumference to diameter is 3.141592 and so on and so forth.
663620	667960	Of course what you call two or four or pi would be different, but the concepts are the
667960	668960	same.
668960	675080	Therefore, we could show the aliens our understanding of math, put two then two then four, four
675520	678520	then eight, keep this going until they get the point.
678520	683280	Although, perhaps the best mathematical principle to demonstrate would be the Pythagorean theorem.
683280	685920	It's complicated, but easy to show.
685920	690360	The Pythagorean theorem, of course, demonstrates that in the case of a right triangle, the
690360	694920	square of the side opposite to the right angle is equal to the square of the other two sides
694920	700040	combined in an equation that reads a squared plus b squared equals c squared.
700040	704480	Visually, we can demonstrate this by drawing squares on the two shorter sides out of smaller
704520	708960	squares and show how the amount of squares on the two sides equals the amount of squares
708960	710600	on the longer side.
710600	715260	Showing this theorem cements that humans do understand how the mathematical aspect of
715260	719320	our universe works, even though we're less advanced than the aliens.
719320	724360	So now that we've found the aliens, now that we have met them, we can talk to them.
724360	727200	Someone needs to speak first, but let's say it was you.
727200	732300	Let's say you were given the chance to ask the first question from humanity to an extraterrestrial
732300	733300	being.
733300	738100	What if you became the first point of contact between humanity and the universe?
738100	740580	What would you ask?
