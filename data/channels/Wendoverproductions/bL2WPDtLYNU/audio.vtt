00:00.000 --> 00:04.640
If we find aliens, what do we do next?

00:04.640 --> 00:09.440
When discussing first contact, many are quick to point out that historically, contact between

00:09.440 --> 00:15.480
culturally different civilizations has almost always led to the destruction of one of those

00:15.480 --> 00:16.480
civilizations.

00:16.480 --> 00:21.740
Because of this, you could argue that we should stick to ourselves, leave the aliens alone,

00:21.740 --> 00:26.500
but in almost every one of those historical examples, it's the civilization that makes

00:26.500 --> 00:31.020
contact that destroys the civilization that receives contact.

00:31.020 --> 00:35.780
So perhaps we should go on the offensive—find the aliens before they find us.

00:35.780 --> 00:39.880
Of course, we've been trying for decades to find extraterrestrial life—it's one

00:39.880 --> 00:43.200
of humanity's great questions—are we alone?

00:43.200 --> 00:47.940
One way we might find aliens is by looking at stars, or more specifically, the light

00:47.940 --> 00:49.420
level of stars.

00:49.420 --> 00:52.740
As the earth has developed, our energy consumption has skyrocketed.

00:52.740 --> 00:57.060
That's just the consequence of an increasingly technologically advanced world.

00:57.060 --> 01:02.220
It's suspected that this trend will continue and it's also suspected that with any alien

01:02.220 --> 01:06.060
civilization, they'll also require more and more energy as they advance.

01:06.060 --> 01:10.540
Eventually, any planetary civilization will reach a point where the amount of energy on

01:10.540 --> 01:14.620
their planet is not enough to sustain their advancing civilization.

01:14.620 --> 01:19.420
Theoretical physicist Freeman Dyson speculated that when a planetary civilization needs more

01:19.420 --> 01:23.560
energy than their planet can provide, they'll turn to the sun.

01:23.560 --> 01:28.220
Stars are the most abundant source of energy in any planetary system so a super-advanced

01:28.220 --> 01:33.660
civilization could build a series of satellites to orbit around their sun to collect energy.

01:33.660 --> 01:38.340
When sunlight travels through space, it loses energy and so the amount of energy captured

01:38.340 --> 01:44.040
by a solar panel near the sun would be astronomically higher than a solar panel on earth.

01:44.040 --> 01:47.940
With more energy a civilization could produce more satellites and eventually there would

01:47.940 --> 01:50.420
be a swarm of satellites orbiting the sun.

01:50.420 --> 01:55.740
Freeman Dyson believes that this is the most logical way that any civilization would harvest

01:55.740 --> 02:00.300
the energy they need so if we search for a star with orbiting satellites, we might be

02:00.300 --> 02:03.140
able to find an alien civilization.

02:03.140 --> 02:08.020
No telescope is powerful enough to see the individual satellites, but we can rather easily

02:08.020 --> 02:10.460
observe the light level of stars.

02:10.460 --> 02:14.780
You see, once a far away civilization builds enough satellites, the swarm will start to

02:14.780 --> 02:18.420
block our view of their sun as the satellites orbit.

02:18.420 --> 02:23.460
From our perspective, it will look like the star is twinkling—something completely unnatural

02:23.460 --> 02:28.660
so, by looking for stars with highly variable light levels, we might be able to find an

02:28.660 --> 02:32.220
alien civilization harvesting the energy of their sun.

02:32.220 --> 02:39.220
KIC 8462852, also known as Tabby's Star, is a star in the Cygnus constellation of the

02:39.220 --> 02:40.700
Milky Way.

02:40.700 --> 02:44.700
Scientists observed the light level of this star for years and they regularly came across

02:44.700 --> 02:47.100
irregularities like this.

02:47.100 --> 02:51.340
Maybe there are comets or a debris field obstructing our view of the star, but astronomers have

02:51.340 --> 02:55.180
doubted that either of those could dip the light levels by this much.

02:55.180 --> 02:59.700
This has led some to suggest that an alien civilization has built these orbiting satellites

02:59.700 --> 03:02.660
around their sun, but we may never know for certain.

03:02.660 --> 03:07.500
Of course all of this is somewhat speculative and it's unlikely that we'd actually find

03:07.500 --> 03:10.100
a so-called Dyson sphere around a sun.

03:10.100 --> 03:14.060
It's more of a thought experiment, demonstrating that we could find aliens through looking

03:14.060 --> 03:16.220
for their impact on the universe.

03:16.220 --> 03:20.340
Conversely, aliens might find us based on our effect on the universe.

03:20.340 --> 03:26.380
That's why we very purposefully sent out messages to our hypothetical cosmic neighbors.

03:26.380 --> 03:30.740
The Pioneer Plaques were designed and placed on the two Pioneer spacecrafts which were

03:30.740 --> 03:34.460
the first to explore the far reaches of the solar system.

03:34.460 --> 03:38.700
Since these two are some of the farthest man-made objects from earth, they were sent with a

03:38.700 --> 03:42.860
message in case extraterrestrials come across the probes.

03:42.860 --> 03:45.780
This is what was sent—the Pioneer Plaque.

03:45.780 --> 03:50.540
It has a representation of hydrogen, the most abundant element in the universe, a picture

03:50.540 --> 03:55.500
of a man and woman including a raised hand, a gesture that most likely wouldn't be understood

03:55.500 --> 04:00.520
but shows how our limbs move and the existence of the opposable thumb, an image of the Pioneer

04:00.520 --> 04:06.100
spacecraft behind the humans so that the extraterrestrials could figure out the rough size of humans,

04:06.100 --> 04:11.700
the location of the sun relative to 14 nearby pulsar stars using hydrogen spin-flip transition

04:11.700 --> 04:16.340
frequency as the unit—something far too complicated for me to explain, and lastly

04:16.340 --> 04:21.460
an image of the solar system with the rough trajectory of the Pioneer spacecraft.

04:21.460 --> 04:23.860
But there are issues with this image.

04:23.860 --> 04:28.240
We have no idea how aliens gather information.

04:28.240 --> 04:32.460
Humans are a visual species since we have relatively good vision so it's natural for

04:32.460 --> 04:35.620
us to convey information through images.

04:35.620 --> 04:39.900
Aliens on the other hand, could have poor or no vision and therefore no conception of

04:39.900 --> 04:45.180
the idea of transferring information through images or they could interpret the symbols

04:45.180 --> 04:46.700
vastly differently.

04:46.700 --> 04:50.140
Perhaps the most frequently criticized aspect of the plaque is the arrow.

04:50.140 --> 04:54.760
It's believed that the arrow symbol is derived from either the shape of arrows or the human

04:54.760 --> 04:58.140
hand pointing, or perhaps a combination of both.

04:58.140 --> 05:03.100
Aliens would most likely have neither arrows or hands and therefore no idea what this symbol

05:03.100 --> 05:04.100
means.

05:04.100 --> 05:08.580
They could also make the dangerous assumption that the symbol depicts a weapon launching

05:08.580 --> 05:11.700
meaning that the spacecraft was sent to harm them.

05:11.700 --> 05:16.580
Other sets of images have been sent with subsequent space probes, but the chance of aliens finding

05:16.580 --> 05:20.620
these few tiny objects in the vastness of space is miniscule.

05:20.620 --> 05:25.020
What's far more likely is that aliens will discover humanity off of something we've

05:25.020 --> 05:28.940
been sending out for over a hundred years—radio signals.

05:28.940 --> 05:33.140
While most are too weak to reach far away galaxies, some do travel through space and

05:33.140 --> 05:38.480
could be picked up by extraterrestrial civilizations—especially more advanced ones with better detection

05:38.480 --> 05:39.640
technology than us.

05:39.640 --> 05:43.760
It's entirely possible that we've already unintentionally sent the signal that will

05:43.760 --> 05:46.960
be our first message to an extraterrestrial civilization.

05:46.960 --> 05:51.640
It's also entirely possible that the first sign we will have of extraterrestrial life

05:51.640 --> 05:53.820
is a radio message from another planet.

05:53.820 --> 05:55.720
The problem is then deciphering it.

05:55.720 --> 05:58.720
The first step is deciding what the message even is.

05:58.720 --> 05:59.720
Is it binary?

05:59.720 --> 06:00.720
Is it radiation?

06:00.720 --> 06:01.760
Is it natural language?

06:01.760 --> 06:02.760
What is it?

06:02.760 --> 06:04.140
We can figure this out.

06:04.140 --> 06:10.500
In the English language, the most common word, the, accounts for about 7% of all word occurrences.

06:10.500 --> 06:15.580
The second most common word, be, accounts for about 3.5% of all words.

06:15.580 --> 06:19.540
Then and is about 2.3% and so on and so forth.

06:19.540 --> 06:24.980
The distribution of words, it turns out, in all languages follows a logarithmic scale.

06:24.980 --> 06:29.700
The second most common word occurs about half as frequently as the most common, the third

06:29.700 --> 06:34.340
and third as often, the fourth one-fourth as often, the fifth one-fifth as often, and

06:34.340 --> 06:36.040
so on and so forth.

06:36.040 --> 06:41.220
This is somehow true for all languages, even ones with no common ancestral language, which

06:41.220 --> 06:46.140
means that, more than likely, an alien language will follow the same distribution.

06:46.140 --> 06:51.020
It's not entirely understood why languages follow this distribution, but one possible

06:51.020 --> 06:53.740
explanation is that people are lazy.

06:53.740 --> 06:56.020
It's called the principle of least effort.

06:56.020 --> 07:01.020
People, animals, even machines will always pick the path of least resistance—the easiest

07:01.020 --> 07:05.380
path—and in the case of language, the meaning that needs to be most frequently conveyed

07:05.380 --> 07:10.140
will be attached to the most common word rather than a number of other words since that is

07:10.140 --> 07:11.420
easiest.

07:11.420 --> 07:15.860
That keeps happening down to the least frequent word therefore creating this distribution.

07:15.860 --> 07:20.700
With an extraterrestrial transmission, if we rank the sounds by frequency and it follows

07:20.700 --> 07:25.280
this distribution we can believe that it's most likely a language.

07:25.280 --> 07:28.220
But then we need to try to understand the language.

07:28.220 --> 07:31.340
For this, we need to drop all assumptions.

07:31.340 --> 07:36.100
There are innate similarities across all human languages, mostly related to grammar.

07:36.100 --> 07:42.520
For example, pretty much every language separates description words, nouns, from action words,

07:42.520 --> 07:43.520
verbs.

07:43.520 --> 07:48.720
Grammatically, there are huge similarities between all languages, even ones that develop

07:48.720 --> 07:49.720
separately.

07:49.720 --> 07:54.360
Some have suggested that this means that humans have a genetic framework for language.

07:54.360 --> 08:00.040
Perhaps we are hardwired from birth to understand what nouns and verbs and sentences are and

08:00.040 --> 08:05.160
learning a language is just the process of filling in and understanding that framework.

08:05.160 --> 08:10.200
From everything we understand about the communication systems that animals use, they do not have

08:10.200 --> 08:12.360
a universal grammar like humans.

08:12.360 --> 08:16.600
We therefore have to assume that an alien language would be fundamentally different

08:16.600 --> 08:17.740
than ours.

08:17.740 --> 08:20.140
We don't know how they'll structure sentences.

08:20.140 --> 08:22.460
We don't even know if they'll have sentences.

08:22.460 --> 08:27.240
The problem is, if we just receive a natural language transmission, there's really nothing

08:27.240 --> 08:28.400
we can do.

08:28.400 --> 08:33.460
When deciphering ancient languages, linguists figure out meaning using context and relations

08:33.460 --> 08:38.820
to other languages, but with an alien language transmission, there is no context and no other

08:38.820 --> 08:41.260
similar languages to compare it with.

08:41.260 --> 08:45.660
All this is assuming that aliens use a verbal language and that's a huge assumption.

08:45.660 --> 08:50.340
Many, if not most, animals have no verbal communication system.

08:50.340 --> 08:54.640
Cuttlefish and chameleons alter their body color to communicate while ants and honeybees

08:54.640 --> 08:57.940
use pheromones to talk to other members of their species.

08:57.940 --> 09:01.660
Even if we understood their language, could we understand what they're saying?

09:01.660 --> 09:03.540
Take this sentence in French.

09:03.540 --> 09:06.020
Translating it literally word for word gets you,

09:06.020 --> 09:10.400
The Palace Bourbon is the name commonly given to the building that houses the Assembly National

09:10.400 --> 09:14.380
French located on the Cay of Orsay in the seventh borough of Paris of the square of

09:14.380 --> 09:15.680
the Concorde.

09:15.680 --> 09:19.760
Even if you clean it up to structure it like an English sentence, how much meaning is conveyed

09:19.760 --> 09:20.760
to you?

09:20.760 --> 09:23.080
What exactly is the French National Assembly?

09:23.080 --> 09:24.840
Where is the Cay of Orsay?

09:24.840 --> 09:26.600
Where is the seventh borough?

09:26.600 --> 09:28.200
Where is Concorde Square?

09:28.200 --> 09:32.080
Someone familiar to Paris and France would understand what these words mean, but someone

09:32.080 --> 09:35.680
from the other side of the world would infer little meaning from them.

09:35.680 --> 09:38.280
Philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein famously wrote,

09:38.280 --> 09:42.520
If a lion could speak, we would not be able to understand him.

09:42.520 --> 09:47.120
Language is all based on cultures and requires a common frame of reference.

09:47.120 --> 09:51.720
If you said, I'm taking an Uber to get some coffee at Starbucks, there's no way it would

09:51.720 --> 09:53.040
understand what you're saying.

09:53.040 --> 09:57.560
You'd have to explain what Uber is, then explain what a car is, what the internet is,

09:57.560 --> 10:02.480
what a phone is, an app, coffee, Starbucks stores, the monetary system—all stuff that

10:02.480 --> 10:05.040
is intuitive to modern humans.

10:05.040 --> 10:09.520
Translating the words of an extraterrestrial civilization is just the first step.

10:09.520 --> 10:12.360
Understanding what they're saying is the more difficult task.

10:12.360 --> 10:17.040
Centuries or millennia after detecting aliens, we might reach a day when an extraterrestrial

10:17.040 --> 10:18.760
being comes to earth.

10:18.760 --> 10:23.640
If this happens, the alien civilization is almost certainly more advanced than humans

10:23.640 --> 10:28.320
since it has accomplished interstellar travel and perhaps even faster than light travel,

10:28.320 --> 10:31.840
but we want to show that us humans are intelligent as well.

10:31.840 --> 10:35.760
Of course the ET would see everything that humans have built, but they might interpret

10:35.760 --> 10:39.260
the structures of mankind as natural phenomenons.

10:39.260 --> 10:43.160
We can't assume that they'd think that buildings and cars and artificial light are

10:43.160 --> 10:45.840
not part of the natural structure of earth.

10:45.840 --> 10:50.440
We therefore need to show them that we have at least a basic understanding of the universe.

10:50.440 --> 10:53.200
Math, as far as we know, is universal.

10:53.200 --> 10:58.280
No matter where you go or who you ask, two plus two is four and the ratio of a circle's

10:58.280 --> 11:03.620
circumference to diameter is 3.141592 and so on and so forth.

11:03.620 --> 11:07.960
Of course what you call two or four or pi would be different, but the concepts are the

11:07.960 --> 11:08.960
same.

11:08.960 --> 11:15.080
Therefore, we could show the aliens our understanding of math, put two then two then four, four

11:15.520 --> 11:18.520
then eight, keep this going until they get the point.

11:18.520 --> 11:23.280
Although, perhaps the best mathematical principle to demonstrate would be the Pythagorean theorem.

11:23.280 --> 11:25.920
It's complicated, but easy to show.

11:25.920 --> 11:30.360
The Pythagorean theorem, of course, demonstrates that in the case of a right triangle, the

11:30.360 --> 11:34.920
square of the side opposite to the right angle is equal to the square of the other two sides

11:34.920 --> 11:40.040
combined in an equation that reads a squared plus b squared equals c squared.

11:40.040 --> 11:44.480
Visually, we can demonstrate this by drawing squares on the two shorter sides out of smaller

11:44.520 --> 11:48.960
squares and show how the amount of squares on the two sides equals the amount of squares

11:48.960 --> 11:50.600
on the longer side.

11:50.600 --> 11:55.260
Showing this theorem cements that humans do understand how the mathematical aspect of

11:55.260 --> 11:59.320
our universe works, even though we're less advanced than the aliens.

11:59.320 --> 12:04.360
So now that we've found the aliens, now that we have met them, we can talk to them.

12:04.360 --> 12:07.200
Someone needs to speak first, but let's say it was you.

12:07.200 --> 12:12.300
Let's say you were given the chance to ask the first question from humanity to an extraterrestrial

12:12.300 --> 12:13.300
being.

12:13.300 --> 12:18.100
What if you became the first point of contact between humanity and the universe?

12:18.100 --> 12:20.580
What would you ask?

12:20.580 --> 12:23.240
