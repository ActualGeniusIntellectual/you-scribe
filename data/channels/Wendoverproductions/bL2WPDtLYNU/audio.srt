1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,640
If we find aliens, what do we do next?

2
00:00:04,640 --> 00:00:09,440
When discussing first contact, many are quick to point out that historically, contact between

3
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:15,480
culturally different civilizations has almost always led to the destruction of one of those

4
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:16,480
civilizations.

5
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:21,740
Because of this, you could argue that we should stick to ourselves, leave the aliens alone,

6
00:00:21,740 --> 00:00:26,500
but in almost every one of those historical examples, it's the civilization that makes

7
00:00:26,500 --> 00:00:31,020
contact that destroys the civilization that receives contact.

8
00:00:31,020 --> 00:00:35,780
So perhaps we should go on the offensive—find the aliens before they find us.

9
00:00:35,780 --> 00:00:39,880
Of course, we've been trying for decades to find extraterrestrial life—it's one

10
00:00:39,880 --> 00:00:43,200
of humanity's great questions—are we alone?

11
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:47,940
One way we might find aliens is by looking at stars, or more specifically, the light

12
00:00:47,940 --> 00:00:49,420
level of stars.

13
00:00:49,420 --> 00:00:52,740
As the earth has developed, our energy consumption has skyrocketed.

14
00:00:52,740 --> 00:00:57,060
That's just the consequence of an increasingly technologically advanced world.

15
00:00:57,060 --> 00:01:02,220
It's suspected that this trend will continue and it's also suspected that with any alien

16
00:01:02,220 --> 00:01:06,060
civilization, they'll also require more and more energy as they advance.

17
00:01:06,060 --> 00:01:10,540
Eventually, any planetary civilization will reach a point where the amount of energy on

18
00:01:10,540 --> 00:01:14,620
their planet is not enough to sustain their advancing civilization.

19
00:01:14,620 --> 00:01:19,420
Theoretical physicist Freeman Dyson speculated that when a planetary civilization needs more

20
00:01:19,420 --> 00:01:23,560
energy than their planet can provide, they'll turn to the sun.

21
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:28,220
Stars are the most abundant source of energy in any planetary system so a super-advanced

22
00:01:28,220 --> 00:01:33,660
civilization could build a series of satellites to orbit around their sun to collect energy.

23
00:01:33,660 --> 00:01:38,340
When sunlight travels through space, it loses energy and so the amount of energy captured

24
00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:44,040
by a solar panel near the sun would be astronomically higher than a solar panel on earth.

25
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:47,940
With more energy a civilization could produce more satellites and eventually there would

26
00:01:47,940 --> 00:01:50,420
be a swarm of satellites orbiting the sun.

27
00:01:50,420 --> 00:01:55,740
Freeman Dyson believes that this is the most logical way that any civilization would harvest

28
00:01:55,740 --> 00:02:00,300
the energy they need so if we search for a star with orbiting satellites, we might be

29
00:02:00,300 --> 00:02:03,140
able to find an alien civilization.

30
00:02:03,140 --> 00:02:08,020
No telescope is powerful enough to see the individual satellites, but we can rather easily

31
00:02:08,020 --> 00:02:10,460
observe the light level of stars.

32
00:02:10,460 --> 00:02:14,780
You see, once a far away civilization builds enough satellites, the swarm will start to

33
00:02:14,780 --> 00:02:18,420
block our view of their sun as the satellites orbit.

34
00:02:18,420 --> 00:02:23,460
From our perspective, it will look like the star is twinkling—something completely unnatural

35
00:02:23,460 --> 00:02:28,660
so, by looking for stars with highly variable light levels, we might be able to find an

36
00:02:28,660 --> 00:02:32,220
alien civilization harvesting the energy of their sun.

37
00:02:32,220 --> 00:02:39,220
KIC 8462852, also known as Tabby's Star, is a star in the Cygnus constellation of the

38
00:02:39,220 --> 00:02:40,700
Milky Way.

39
00:02:40,700 --> 00:02:44,700
Scientists observed the light level of this star for years and they regularly came across

40
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:47,100
irregularities like this.

41
00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:51,340
Maybe there are comets or a debris field obstructing our view of the star, but astronomers have

42
00:02:51,340 --> 00:02:55,180
doubted that either of those could dip the light levels by this much.

43
00:02:55,180 --> 00:02:59,700
This has led some to suggest that an alien civilization has built these orbiting satellites

44
00:02:59,700 --> 00:03:02,660
around their sun, but we may never know for certain.

45
00:03:02,660 --> 00:03:07,500
Of course all of this is somewhat speculative and it's unlikely that we'd actually find

46
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:10,100
a so-called Dyson sphere around a sun.

47
00:03:10,100 --> 00:03:14,060
It's more of a thought experiment, demonstrating that we could find aliens through looking

48
00:03:14,060 --> 00:03:16,220
for their impact on the universe.

49
00:03:16,220 --> 00:03:20,340
Conversely, aliens might find us based on our effect on the universe.

50
00:03:20,340 --> 00:03:26,380
That's why we very purposefully sent out messages to our hypothetical cosmic neighbors.

51
00:03:26,380 --> 00:03:30,740
The Pioneer Plaques were designed and placed on the two Pioneer spacecrafts which were

52
00:03:30,740 --> 00:03:34,460
the first to explore the far reaches of the solar system.

53
00:03:34,460 --> 00:03:38,700
Since these two are some of the farthest man-made objects from earth, they were sent with a

54
00:03:38,700 --> 00:03:42,860
message in case extraterrestrials come across the probes.

55
00:03:42,860 --> 00:03:45,780
This is what was sent—the Pioneer Plaque.

56
00:03:45,780 --> 00:03:50,540
It has a representation of hydrogen, the most abundant element in the universe, a picture

57
00:03:50,540 --> 00:03:55,500
of a man and woman including a raised hand, a gesture that most likely wouldn't be understood

58
00:03:55,500 --> 00:04:00,520
but shows how our limbs move and the existence of the opposable thumb, an image of the Pioneer

59
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:06,100
spacecraft behind the humans so that the extraterrestrials could figure out the rough size of humans,

60
00:04:06,100 --> 00:04:11,700
the location of the sun relative to 14 nearby pulsar stars using hydrogen spin-flip transition

61
00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:16,340
frequency as the unit—something far too complicated for me to explain, and lastly

62
00:04:16,340 --> 00:04:21,460
an image of the solar system with the rough trajectory of the Pioneer spacecraft.

63
00:04:21,460 --> 00:04:23,860
But there are issues with this image.

64
00:04:23,860 --> 00:04:28,240
We have no idea how aliens gather information.

65
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:32,460
Humans are a visual species since we have relatively good vision so it's natural for

66
00:04:32,460 --> 00:04:35,620
us to convey information through images.

67
00:04:35,620 --> 00:04:39,900
Aliens on the other hand, could have poor or no vision and therefore no conception of

68
00:04:39,900 --> 00:04:45,180
the idea of transferring information through images or they could interpret the symbols

69
00:04:45,180 --> 00:04:46,700
vastly differently.

70
00:04:46,700 --> 00:04:50,140
Perhaps the most frequently criticized aspect of the plaque is the arrow.

71
00:04:50,140 --> 00:04:54,760
It's believed that the arrow symbol is derived from either the shape of arrows or the human

72
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:58,140
hand pointing, or perhaps a combination of both.

73
00:04:58,140 --> 00:05:03,100
Aliens would most likely have neither arrows or hands and therefore no idea what this symbol

74
00:05:03,100 --> 00:05:04,100
means.

75
00:05:04,100 --> 00:05:08,580
They could also make the dangerous assumption that the symbol depicts a weapon launching

76
00:05:08,580 --> 00:05:11,700
meaning that the spacecraft was sent to harm them.

77
00:05:11,700 --> 00:05:16,580
Other sets of images have been sent with subsequent space probes, but the chance of aliens finding

78
00:05:16,580 --> 00:05:20,620
these few tiny objects in the vastness of space is miniscule.

79
00:05:20,620 --> 00:05:25,020
What's far more likely is that aliens will discover humanity off of something we've

80
00:05:25,020 --> 00:05:28,940
been sending out for over a hundred years—radio signals.

81
00:05:28,940 --> 00:05:33,140
While most are too weak to reach far away galaxies, some do travel through space and

82
00:05:33,140 --> 00:05:38,480
could be picked up by extraterrestrial civilizations—especially more advanced ones with better detection

83
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:39,640
technology than us.

84
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:43,760
It's entirely possible that we've already unintentionally sent the signal that will

85
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:46,960
be our first message to an extraterrestrial civilization.

86
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:51,640
It's also entirely possible that the first sign we will have of extraterrestrial life

87
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:53,820
is a radio message from another planet.

88
00:05:53,820 --> 00:05:55,720
The problem is then deciphering it.

89
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:58,720
The first step is deciding what the message even is.

90
00:05:58,720 --> 00:05:59,720
Is it binary?

91
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:00,720
Is it radiation?

92
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:01,760
Is it natural language?

93
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:02,760
What is it?

94
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:04,140
We can figure this out.

95
00:06:04,140 --> 00:06:10,500
In the English language, the most common word, the, accounts for about 7% of all word occurrences.

96
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:15,580
The second most common word, be, accounts for about 3.5% of all words.

97
00:06:15,580 --> 00:06:19,540
Then and is about 2.3% and so on and so forth.

98
00:06:19,540 --> 00:06:24,980
The distribution of words, it turns out, in all languages follows a logarithmic scale.

99
00:06:24,980 --> 00:06:29,700
The second most common word occurs about half as frequently as the most common, the third

100
00:06:29,700 --> 00:06:34,340
and third as often, the fourth one-fourth as often, the fifth one-fifth as often, and

101
00:06:34,340 --> 00:06:36,040
so on and so forth.

102
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:41,220
This is somehow true for all languages, even ones with no common ancestral language, which

103
00:06:41,220 --> 00:06:46,140
means that, more than likely, an alien language will follow the same distribution.

104
00:06:46,140 --> 00:06:51,020
It's not entirely understood why languages follow this distribution, but one possible

105
00:06:51,020 --> 00:06:53,740
explanation is that people are lazy.

106
00:06:53,740 --> 00:06:56,020
It's called the principle of least effort.

107
00:06:56,020 --> 00:07:01,020
People, animals, even machines will always pick the path of least resistance—the easiest

108
00:07:01,020 --> 00:07:05,380
path—and in the case of language, the meaning that needs to be most frequently conveyed

109
00:07:05,380 --> 00:07:10,140
will be attached to the most common word rather than a number of other words since that is

110
00:07:10,140 --> 00:07:11,420
easiest.

111
00:07:11,420 --> 00:07:15,860
That keeps happening down to the least frequent word therefore creating this distribution.

112
00:07:15,860 --> 00:07:20,700
With an extraterrestrial transmission, if we rank the sounds by frequency and it follows

113
00:07:20,700 --> 00:07:25,280
this distribution we can believe that it's most likely a language.

114
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:28,220
But then we need to try to understand the language.

115
00:07:28,220 --> 00:07:31,340
For this, we need to drop all assumptions.

116
00:07:31,340 --> 00:07:36,100
There are innate similarities across all human languages, mostly related to grammar.

117
00:07:36,100 --> 00:07:42,520
For example, pretty much every language separates description words, nouns, from action words,

118
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:43,520
verbs.

119
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:48,720
Grammatically, there are huge similarities between all languages, even ones that develop

120
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:49,720
separately.

121
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:54,360
Some have suggested that this means that humans have a genetic framework for language.

122
00:07:54,360 --> 00:08:00,040
Perhaps we are hardwired from birth to understand what nouns and verbs and sentences are and

123
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:05,160
learning a language is just the process of filling in and understanding that framework.

124
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:10,200
From everything we understand about the communication systems that animals use, they do not have

125
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:12,360
a universal grammar like humans.

126
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:16,600
We therefore have to assume that an alien language would be fundamentally different

127
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:17,740
than ours.

128
00:08:17,740 --> 00:08:20,140
We don't know how they'll structure sentences.

129
00:08:20,140 --> 00:08:22,460
We don't even know if they'll have sentences.

130
00:08:22,460 --> 00:08:27,240
The problem is, if we just receive a natural language transmission, there's really nothing

131
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:28,400
we can do.

132
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:33,460
When deciphering ancient languages, linguists figure out meaning using context and relations

133
00:08:33,460 --> 00:08:38,820
to other languages, but with an alien language transmission, there is no context and no other

134
00:08:38,820 --> 00:08:41,260
similar languages to compare it with.

135
00:08:41,260 --> 00:08:45,660
All this is assuming that aliens use a verbal language and that's a huge assumption.

136
00:08:45,660 --> 00:08:50,340
Many, if not most, animals have no verbal communication system.

137
00:08:50,340 --> 00:08:54,640
Cuttlefish and chameleons alter their body color to communicate while ants and honeybees

138
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:57,940
use pheromones to talk to other members of their species.

139
00:08:57,940 --> 00:09:01,660
Even if we understood their language, could we understand what they're saying?

140
00:09:01,660 --> 00:09:03,540
Take this sentence in French.

141
00:09:03,540 --> 00:09:06,020
Translating it literally word for word gets you,

142
00:09:06,020 --> 00:09:10,400
The Palace Bourbon is the name commonly given to the building that houses the Assembly National

143
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:14,380
French located on the Cay of Orsay in the seventh borough of Paris of the square of

144
00:09:14,380 --> 00:09:15,680
the Concorde.

145
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:19,760
Even if you clean it up to structure it like an English sentence, how much meaning is conveyed

146
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:20,760
to you?

147
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:23,080
What exactly is the French National Assembly?

148
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:24,840
Where is the Cay of Orsay?

149
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:26,600
Where is the seventh borough?

150
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:28,200
Where is Concorde Square?

151
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:32,080
Someone familiar to Paris and France would understand what these words mean, but someone

152
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:35,680
from the other side of the world would infer little meaning from them.

153
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:38,280
Philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein famously wrote,

154
00:09:38,280 --> 00:09:42,520
If a lion could speak, we would not be able to understand him.

155
00:09:42,520 --> 00:09:47,120
Language is all based on cultures and requires a common frame of reference.

156
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:51,720
If you said, I'm taking an Uber to get some coffee at Starbucks, there's no way it would

157
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:53,040
understand what you're saying.

158
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:57,560
You'd have to explain what Uber is, then explain what a car is, what the internet is,

159
00:09:57,560 --> 00:10:02,480
what a phone is, an app, coffee, Starbucks stores, the monetary system—all stuff that

160
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:05,040
is intuitive to modern humans.

161
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:09,520
Translating the words of an extraterrestrial civilization is just the first step.

162
00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:12,360
Understanding what they're saying is the more difficult task.

163
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:17,040
Centuries or millennia after detecting aliens, we might reach a day when an extraterrestrial

164
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:18,760
being comes to earth.

165
00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:23,640
If this happens, the alien civilization is almost certainly more advanced than humans

166
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:28,320
since it has accomplished interstellar travel and perhaps even faster than light travel,

167
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:31,840
but we want to show that us humans are intelligent as well.

168
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:35,760
Of course the ET would see everything that humans have built, but they might interpret

169
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:39,260
the structures of mankind as natural phenomenons.

170
00:10:39,260 --> 00:10:43,160
We can't assume that they'd think that buildings and cars and artificial light are

171
00:10:43,160 --> 00:10:45,840
not part of the natural structure of earth.

172
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:50,440
We therefore need to show them that we have at least a basic understanding of the universe.

173
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:53,200
Math, as far as we know, is universal.

174
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:58,280
No matter where you go or who you ask, two plus two is four and the ratio of a circle's

175
00:10:58,280 --> 00:11:03,620
circumference to diameter is 3.141592 and so on and so forth.

176
00:11:03,620 --> 00:11:07,960
Of course what you call two or four or pi would be different, but the concepts are the

177
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:08,960
same.

178
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:15,080
Therefore, we could show the aliens our understanding of math, put two then two then four, four

179
00:11:15,520 --> 00:11:18,520
then eight, keep this going until they get the point.

180
00:11:18,520 --> 00:11:23,280
Although, perhaps the best mathematical principle to demonstrate would be the Pythagorean theorem.

181
00:11:23,280 --> 00:11:25,920
It's complicated, but easy to show.

182
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:30,360
The Pythagorean theorem, of course, demonstrates that in the case of a right triangle, the

183
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:34,920
square of the side opposite to the right angle is equal to the square of the other two sides

184
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:40,040
combined in an equation that reads a squared plus b squared equals c squared.

185
00:11:40,040 --> 00:11:44,480
Visually, we can demonstrate this by drawing squares on the two shorter sides out of smaller

186
00:11:44,520 --> 00:11:48,960
squares and show how the amount of squares on the two sides equals the amount of squares

187
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:50,600
on the longer side.

188
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:55,260
Showing this theorem cements that humans do understand how the mathematical aspect of

189
00:11:55,260 --> 00:11:59,320
our universe works, even though we're less advanced than the aliens.

190
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:04,360
So now that we've found the aliens, now that we have met them, we can talk to them.

191
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:07,200
Someone needs to speak first, but let's say it was you.

192
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:12,300
Let's say you were given the chance to ask the first question from humanity to an extraterrestrial

193
00:12:12,300 --> 00:12:13,300
being.

194
00:12:13,300 --> 00:12:18,100
What if you became the first point of contact between humanity and the universe?

195
00:12:18,100 --> 00:12:20,580
What would you ask?

196
00:12:20,580 --> 00:12:23,240
I hope you enjoyed this Wendover Productions video.

197
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:27,500
These videos are hugely expensive to make and I can only do it thanks to the help of

198
00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:28,980
my Patreon supporters.

199
00:12:28,980 --> 00:12:34,380
I have to buy stock footage, buy music, hire a sound designer, pay for programs, pay for

200
00:12:34,380 --> 00:12:37,860
hardware, and that's not even taking into account the time that I personally put into

201
00:12:37,860 --> 00:12:38,860
these videos.

202
00:12:38,860 --> 00:12:42,340
If you'd like to make sure that I can keep doing these videos and make them better and

203
00:12:42,340 --> 00:12:46,300
better, please consider supporting me on Patreon by clicking here.

204
00:12:46,300 --> 00:12:50,300
Every dollar contributed is spent directly on the channel, none of it goes to me, and

205
00:12:50,300 --> 00:12:53,920
I'm held to that by releasing expense reports at the end of each month.

206
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:58,900
There are also some great rewards including early access to videos, stickers, handwritten

207
00:12:58,900 --> 00:13:01,660
letters, and most recently, t-shirts.

208
00:13:01,660 --> 00:13:06,060
You can also order a t-shirt by itself for only $20 through DFTBA.

209
00:13:06,060 --> 00:13:08,840
The link is here and also in the description.

210
00:13:08,840 --> 00:13:13,160
Other than that, please make sure to follow me on Twitter at WendoverPro, watch my last

211
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:18,800
video on why cities are where they are here, check out my fan moderate subreddit here,

212
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:22,920
and most of all subscribe to this channel to receive all my future videos right when

213
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:24,200
they come out.

214
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:28,520
Thanks again for watching and I'll see you in two weeks for another Wendover Productions

215
00:13:28,520 --> 00:13:29,040
video.
