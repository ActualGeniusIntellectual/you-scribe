00:08.460 --> 00:12.160
Airlines can make a lot of money by flying to the right places.

00:12.160 --> 00:16.640
British Airways, for example, long ago cemented themselves as the leader on the London Heathrow

00:16.640 --> 00:22.160
to New York JFK route and flying between these two airports now earns them over $1 billion

00:22.160 --> 00:23.160
per year.

00:23.160 --> 00:26.320
That's more than any airline makes on any other route in the world.

00:26.360 --> 00:31.320
Conversely, though, airlines can lose a lot of money by flying to the wrong places.

00:31.320 --> 00:35.520
American Airlines, for example, recently cancelled their Chicago to Beijing flight as it was

00:35.520 --> 00:38.400
losing them tens of millions of dollars per year.

00:38.400 --> 00:42.480
Now, the fact that this route failed might be puzzling considering it flew between the

00:42.480 --> 00:45.720
world's 50th and the world's 7th largest city.

00:45.720 --> 00:50.520
Even more, they were flying the 787A streamliner—the smallest plane they could on this route.

00:50.520 --> 00:53.880
Nonetheless, it was truly a financial disaster.

00:53.880 --> 00:59.200
The airlines said that, in terms of annual revenue, the route was $80 million away from

00:59.200 --> 01:00.200
their target.

01:00.200 --> 01:04.280
The truth is that deciding where to fly is a lot more complicated than pairing up the

01:04.280 --> 01:05.280
largest cities.

01:05.280 --> 01:09.040
It's an art that people spend their whole lives mastering and the difference between

01:09.040 --> 01:12.780
an airline that's good at route planning and one that's bad at it can be the difference

01:12.780 --> 01:15.520
between a profitable airline and a defunct one.

01:15.520 --> 01:23.000
In 2015, the big three airlines in the US—American, Delta, and United—launched 101 new routes.

01:23.000 --> 01:26.400
These included everything from United's new 30-minute regional flight between Chicago

01:26.400 --> 01:30.920
and Kalamazoo to Delta's new Trans-Pacific service between Los Angeles and Shanghai.

01:30.920 --> 01:33.880
Some of these 101 survived, some did not.

01:33.880 --> 01:38.280
Of the routes that Delta launched in 2015, about 70% still fly today.

01:38.280 --> 01:42.720
There were some big, noticeable cancellations from their 2015 launched routes including

01:42.720 --> 01:47.000
Orlando to Sao Paulo, New York to Manchester, and Philadelphia to London.

01:47.000 --> 01:52.320
Meanwhile, American Airlines did a little better with 76% of their 2015 routes surviving

01:52.320 --> 01:53.320
today.

01:53.320 --> 01:57.920
Still, they clearly had some expensive failures with routes like Dallas to Quito, Miami to

01:57.920 --> 02:00.240
Frankfurt, and New York to Birmingham.

02:00.240 --> 02:05.800
United Airlines, though, has a noticeably higher 85% of those 2015 routes still flying

02:05.800 --> 02:06.800
today.

02:06.800 --> 02:11.400
The only four routes from 2015 that didn't work out were Houston to Peoria, Newark to

02:11.400 --> 02:14.400
Newcastle, Dallas to Moline, and Denver to San Jose.

02:14.400 --> 02:19.380
Now, it's worth noting that the survival of routes is not the one definitive measure

02:19.380 --> 02:22.560
of how good airlines are at route planning.

02:22.560 --> 02:26.460
Different companies might have different risk tolerances, they might wait out a route longer,

02:26.460 --> 02:30.380
there are a lot of other factors involved, but there is other evidence that United is

02:30.380 --> 02:32.380
good at route planning.

02:32.380 --> 02:37.400
There are a number of destinations that United is the sole American airline to operate to.

02:37.400 --> 02:42.020
Just looking at long-haul destinations, that includes Melbourne, Tahiti, Taipei, Chengdu,

02:42.020 --> 02:46.080
Delhi, Mumbai, Naples, Porto, and Stockholm.

02:46.080 --> 02:50.440
In some of these cases, there might be just enough traffic to support one US airline flying

02:50.440 --> 02:52.960
there and United got there first.

02:52.960 --> 02:57.080
In addition, there are plenty of routes that United flies without non-stop competition

02:57.080 --> 03:02.720
like Denver to Tokyo, Houston to Rio de Janeiro, DC to Zurich, and Chicago to Edinburgh.

03:02.720 --> 03:07.080
Many of these potentially riskier routes have survived for years so they're clearly good

03:07.080 --> 03:08.080
at route planning.

03:08.080 --> 03:12.640
They're clearly good at finding the opportunities both big and small.

03:12.880 --> 03:17.080
According to United, the two major factors they look at when deciding where to fly are

03:17.080 --> 03:20.680
how many people want to go there and how much are they willing to pay.

03:20.680 --> 03:24.440
These questions are easy to ask but extremely difficult to answer.

03:24.440 --> 03:27.160
That's why it's people's whole jobs.

03:27.160 --> 03:31.440
For figuring out how many people want to go to a place, the airline itself has a decent

03:31.440 --> 03:32.760
amount of data.

03:32.760 --> 03:38.120
The majority of new United routes are to destinations already served by another one of their hubs.

03:38.120 --> 03:42.760
For example, one of the routes that United added in 2015 was from Denver to Southwest

03:42.760 --> 03:47.080
Oregon Regional Airport which was already served by its San Francisco hub.

03:47.080 --> 03:51.120
Given that, United already had data on how many people flew there from Denver via San

03:51.120 --> 03:54.320
Francisco and would therefore take a non-stop flight.

03:54.320 --> 03:58.660
United also flies to a number of places non-stop from Denver that it doesn't from San Francisco

03:58.660 --> 04:03.480
such as Albuquerque, Sioux Falls, and Wichita that would now have a one-stop option to Southwest

04:03.480 --> 04:06.300
Oregon Regional Airport rather than a two-stop.

04:06.300 --> 04:10.440
For brand new destinations though, especially long-haul ones, United doesn't have its

04:10.440 --> 04:14.100
own passenger figures so they have to figure out how many people want to go there through

04:14.100 --> 04:15.500
other means.

04:15.500 --> 04:19.860
One of the great assets that travel booking sites like Expedia, Google Flights, and Skyscanner

04:19.860 --> 04:23.160
have is that they know where people want to fly.

04:23.160 --> 04:27.080
They know which city pairs people search for flights between and many sell this incredibly

04:27.080 --> 04:30.180
valuable data to market research companies and airlines.

04:30.180 --> 04:34.580
Skyscanner, for example, knows that 190,000 people a year search for a flight between

04:34.580 --> 04:39.060
Birmingham and Hong Kong, 420,000 people a year search for a flight between Delhi and

04:39.060 --> 04:43.780
Auckland, 1.1 million people a year search for a flight between Bangkok and Barcelona,

04:43.780 --> 04:47.580
and 1.4 million people a year search for a flight between London and Kochi.

04:47.580 --> 04:51.520
These all represent big opportunities that airlines have yet to act on.

04:51.520 --> 04:54.860
People are still making these trips but having to connect.

04:54.860 --> 04:59.300
Creating a non-stop flight on any of these routes would capture a decent amount of the

04:59.300 --> 05:00.300
traffic.

05:00.300 --> 05:03.460
The reason some of these popular routes do not have a non-stop service, though, comes

05:03.460 --> 05:07.380
down to that second factor—how much people are willing to pay.

05:07.380 --> 05:11.960
People usually pay a premium to fly on non-stop flights, but there's a maximum to how much

05:11.960 --> 05:14.340
extra people will pay for the convenience.

05:14.340 --> 05:19.740
In October, 2017, United launched a new non-stop route from Los Angeles to Singapore to much

05:19.740 --> 05:20.740
fanfare.

05:20.740 --> 05:23.900
This would be the airline's longest ever route, the only non-stop connection between

05:23.900 --> 05:27.360
the two cities, and they expected it to do great.

05:27.360 --> 05:29.580
The problem, though, was the competition.

05:29.580 --> 05:33.580
Currently, round-ship connecting flights between Los Angeles and Singapore are on sale

05:33.580 --> 05:36.900
for as little as $444.

05:36.900 --> 05:40.860
At the time that United was flying this route, they were supposedly even less.

05:40.860 --> 05:45.020
United just couldn't come close to the prices that others were offering and, exactly a year

05:45.020 --> 05:47.180
after this route was launched, it was cancelled.

05:47.180 --> 05:51.380
It wasn't a complete failure—they ended up just adding a second frequency to Singapore

05:51.380 --> 05:55.940
from San Francisco—but it is an example of a route that looked great on paper but

05:55.940 --> 05:57.700
didn't work out in reality.

05:57.700 --> 06:01.160
It was a similar reason that likely led to the cancellation of the American flight from

06:01.160 --> 06:05.460
Chicago to Beijing mentioned at the beginning—it was just too tough to compete against the

06:05.460 --> 06:10.340
low fares of Asian airlines and, as a result, American's planes were crossing the Pacific

06:10.340 --> 06:11.500
empty.

06:11.500 --> 06:15.580
In all, airlines need to figure out what people will pay for a route to figure out if it's

06:15.580 --> 06:19.860
profitable and also if it's going to be the most profitable route they can add.

06:19.860 --> 06:23.660
Part of the reason why American and Delta might not have added a non-stop flight to

06:23.660 --> 06:28.180
Singapore is because they can make more money using the same plane elsewhere.

06:28.180 --> 06:32.540
United essentially has now used up four of its planes to fly its two daily flights to

06:32.540 --> 06:33.540
Singapore.

06:33.540 --> 06:38.580
They're charging a minimum of about $800 to fly round-trip on this 16-hour flight whereas,

06:38.580 --> 06:43.620
from the east coast, United is also charging about $800 to fly round-trip on their 6-hour

06:43.620 --> 06:46.060
flight from DC to London.

06:46.060 --> 06:49.740
Airlines need to consider whether, out of a whole world of options, they're picking

06:49.740 --> 06:52.380
the best one when adding a route.

06:52.380 --> 06:56.220
Beyond these two main factors, there are others involved in whether or not a route

06:56.220 --> 06:57.220
will work financially.

06:57.220 --> 07:01.780
For example, while a certain route might work for one airline, the exact same route might

07:01.780 --> 07:03.440
not work for another.

07:03.440 --> 07:08.580
From Australia, there are three routes to mainland China operated by Australian airlines—Qantas

07:08.580 --> 07:12.740
from Sydney to Beijing and Shanghai and Jetstar from Melbourne to Zhenzhou.

07:12.740 --> 07:19.020
Meanwhile, from mainland China, there are 43 routes to Australia operated by Chinese

07:19.020 --> 07:20.020
airlines.

07:20.020 --> 07:23.940
This extreme imbalance exists because people tend to prefer to fly on airlines from their

07:23.940 --> 07:28.100
home country, especially in cases like this where the language is different.

07:28.100 --> 07:33.420
There are far more Chinese traveling to Australia than Australians traveling to China so, therefore,

07:33.420 --> 07:37.640
there are far more Chinese airlines flying to Australia than vice versa.

07:37.640 --> 07:41.220
Of course there are other factors involved such as, given the lower cost of living in

07:41.220 --> 07:45.740
China, Chinese airlines have lower labor costs and are therefore able to offer lower fares,

07:45.740 --> 07:50.160
but when an airline is figuring out whether a route will work, the nationality and directionality

07:50.160 --> 07:52.660
of travelers does matter.

07:52.660 --> 07:57.120
Sometimes though, a route is launched that just doesn't make financial sense, at least

07:57.120 --> 07:58.820
independently.

07:58.820 --> 08:02.840
Sometimes airlines launch routes primarily to slow the advance of a competitor.

08:02.840 --> 08:08.180
For example, on September 6th, 2017, Wow Air, the Icelandic budget airline, announced that

08:08.180 --> 08:11.100
it would start flying from Reykjavik to Dallas.

08:11.100 --> 08:15.260
Less than a week later, Icelandair, the other major Icelandic airline, announced that they

08:15.260 --> 08:18.260
too would start flying from Reykjavik to Dallas.

08:18.260 --> 08:22.420
About a month after that, American Airlines announced that they would also start flying

08:22.420 --> 08:24.140
to Reykjavik from Dallas.

08:24.140 --> 08:28.660
Now, Dallas is very much a fortress hub for American Airlines.

08:28.660 --> 08:32.880
That is, they control a huge percentage of the market share there and they want it to

08:32.880 --> 08:33.880
stay that way.

08:33.880 --> 08:38.620
They didn't want their customers to start flying on Wow or Icelandair to Iceland or,

08:38.620 --> 08:40.500
more importantly, beyond to Europe.

08:40.500 --> 08:45.240
While Iceland has seen a significant increase in tourism traffic over the past decade, there

08:45.240 --> 08:49.320
are a few signs signaling that this route addition might have been more for competitive

08:49.320 --> 08:53.060
purposes than because it was the best financial choice independently.

08:53.060 --> 08:57.740
The first is the suspicious timing—announcing quite soon after the two other airlines did—and

08:57.740 --> 09:01.320
the other is that it really doesn't make sense for American's one and only Iceland

09:01.320 --> 09:03.600
flight to leave from Dallas.

09:03.600 --> 09:07.480
This requires all connecting travelers from the east half of the country to backtrack

09:07.480 --> 09:10.420
to Dallas if they want to fly on American to Iceland.

09:10.420 --> 09:14.200
The airline has, in recent years, concentrated most of their transatlantic flights going

09:14.200 --> 09:19.040
to leisure-oriented destinations, such as Iceland, to their Philadelphia hub but, in

09:19.040 --> 09:23.520
this case, it was clearly most likely more about stopping Wow and Icelandair.

09:23.520 --> 09:25.900
In this, American was successful.

09:25.900 --> 09:29.120
Both of its competitors have since stopped flying to Dallas.

09:29.120 --> 09:33.000
While this and other similar routes might not make money themselves, overall they're

09:33.000 --> 09:37.400
a right decision for the company since they can force a competitor out of the market and,

09:37.400 --> 09:41.840
in this case, passengers that might have connected on Wow or Icelandair from Dallas to Europe

09:41.840 --> 09:44.520
would now take American's transatlantic flights.

09:44.520 --> 09:49.380
So, once all that analysis happens, once an airline decides that it's a good idea to

09:49.380 --> 09:53.880
launch a route, it still doesn't mean that an airline can go ahead and start flying.

09:53.880 --> 09:56.640
Obviously, they need a spare plane.

09:56.640 --> 10:01.360
That can either come from another route cancellation or through a new aircraft delivery.

10:01.360 --> 10:06.280
For example, United's new route from San Francisco to Tahiti, with relatively low demand,

10:06.280 --> 10:10.240
required its smallest long-haul plane—the 787-8 Dreamliner.

10:10.240 --> 10:14.800
One of those only became available when a new 787-9 was delivered from Boeing that replaced

10:14.800 --> 10:19.080
an older 787-8 on the busier San Francisco to Munich route.

10:19.080 --> 10:23.320
Airlines also need gate space and, at some busy airports, a landing slot.

10:23.320 --> 10:28.200
For many international routes, airlines also need government approval to begin a new flight.

10:28.200 --> 10:33.160
There's plenty more uninteresting bureaucracy but then, sometime, usually years after an

10:33.160 --> 10:36.980
airline first examines whether a route will make sense, the first plane will take off

10:36.980 --> 10:39.180
between those two airports.

10:39.180 --> 10:43.260
No matter how much work is put into analyzing whether a route will work, reality always

10:43.260 --> 10:45.380
has unforeseen variables.

10:45.380 --> 10:49.520
The true test of whether a route will work is actually flying the route.

10:49.520 --> 10:52.060
Once that happens, airlines will evaluate its performance.

10:52.060 --> 10:55.140
If it's making enough money, it will keep flying.

10:55.140 --> 10:57.540
If it's not, it usually will not.

10:57.540 --> 11:01.580
This is all part of airlines' continuous cycle of planning, launching, and evaluating

11:01.580 --> 11:06.420
routes in order to find the few that can actually turn a profit in this notoriously financially

11:06.420 --> 11:09.140
difficult industry.

11:09.140 --> 11:13.600
If you're watching this video, there are two things that you almost certainly like—documentaries

11:13.600 --> 11:14.600
and aviation.

11:14.600 --> 11:18.600
Therefore, I would imagine you would like this documentary on CuriosityStream about

11:18.600 --> 11:21.700
the whole process that it takes to make an Airbus A380 wing.

11:21.700 --> 11:25.540
It's a fascinating look at all the work that goes into producing what is perhaps the

11:25.540 --> 11:27.940
most important element of that plane.

11:27.940 --> 11:32.220
