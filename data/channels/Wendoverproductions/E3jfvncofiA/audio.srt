00:00:08,460 --> 00:00:12,160
Airlines can make a lot of money by flying to the right places.

4
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:16,640
British Airways, for example, long ago cemented themselves as the leader on the London Heathrow

5
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:22,160
to New York JFK route and flying between these two airports now earns them over $1 billion

6
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:23,160
per year.

7
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:26,320
That's more than any airline makes on any other route in the world.

8
00:00:26,360 --> 00:00:31,320
Conversely, though, airlines can lose a lot of money by flying to the wrong places.

9
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:35,520
American Airlines, for example, recently cancelled their Chicago to Beijing flight as it was

10
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:38,400
losing them tens of millions of dollars per year.

11
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:42,480
Now, the fact that this route failed might be puzzling considering it flew between the

12
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:45,720
world's 50th and the world's 7th largest city.

13
00:00:45,720 --> 00:00:50,520
Even more, they were flying the 787A streamliner—the smallest plane they could on this route.

14
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:53,880
Nonetheless, it was truly a financial disaster.

15
00:00:53,880 --> 00:00:59,200
The airlines said that, in terms of annual revenue, the route was $80 million away from

16
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:00,200
their target.

17
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:04,280
The truth is that deciding where to fly is a lot more complicated than pairing up the

18
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:05,280
largest cities.

19
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:09,040
It's an art that people spend their whole lives mastering and the difference between

20
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:12,780
an airline that's good at route planning and one that's bad at it can be the difference

21
00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:15,520
between a profitable airline and a defunct one.

22
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:23,000
In 2015, the big three airlines in the US—American, Delta, and United—launched 101 new routes.

23
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,400
These included everything from United's new 30-minute regional flight between Chicago

24
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:30,920
and Kalamazoo to Delta's new Trans-Pacific service between Los Angeles and Shanghai.

25
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:33,880
Some of these 101 survived, some did not.

26
00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:38,280
Of the routes that Delta launched in 2015, about 70% still fly today.

27
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:42,720
There were some big, noticeable cancellations from their 2015 launched routes including

28
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:47,000
Orlando to Sao Paulo, New York to Manchester, and Philadelphia to London.

29
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:52,320
Meanwhile, American Airlines did a little better with 76% of their 2015 routes surviving

30
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:53,320
today.

31
00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:57,920
Still, they clearly had some expensive failures with routes like Dallas to Quito, Miami to

32
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:00,240
Frankfurt, and New York to Birmingham.

33
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:05,800
United Airlines, though, has a noticeably higher 85% of those 2015 routes still flying

34
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:06,800
today.

35
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:11,400
The only four routes from 2015 that didn't work out were Houston to Peoria, Newark to

36
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:14,400
Newcastle, Dallas to Moline, and Denver to San Jose.

37
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:19,380
Now, it's worth noting that the survival of routes is not the one definitive measure

38
00:02:19,380 --> 00:02:22,560
of how good airlines are at route planning.

39
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:26,460
Different companies might have different risk tolerances, they might wait out a route longer,

40
00:02:26,460 --> 00:02:30,380
there are a lot of other factors involved, but there is other evidence that United is

41
00:02:30,380 --> 00:02:32,380
good at route planning.

42
00:02:32,380 --> 00:02:37,400
There are a number of destinations that United is the sole American airline to operate to.

43
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:42,020
Just looking at long-haul destinations, that includes Melbourne, Tahiti, Taipei, Chengdu,

44
00:02:42,020 --> 00:02:46,080
Delhi, Mumbai, Naples, Porto, and Stockholm.

45
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:50,440
In some of these cases, there might be just enough traffic to support one US airline flying

46
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:52,960
there and United got there first.

47
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:57,080
In addition, there are plenty of routes that United flies without non-stop competition

48
00:02:57,080 --> 00:03:02,720
like Denver to Tokyo, Houston to Rio de Janeiro, DC to Zurich, and Chicago to Edinburgh.

49
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:07,080
Many of these potentially riskier routes have survived for years so they're clearly good

50
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:08,080
at route planning.

51
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:12,640
They're clearly good at finding the opportunities both big and small.

52
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:17,080
According to United, the two major factors they look at when deciding where to fly are

53
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:20,680
how many people want to go there and how much are they willing to pay.

54
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:24,440
These questions are easy to ask but extremely difficult to answer.

55
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:27,160
That's why it's people's whole jobs.

56
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:31,440
For figuring out how many people want to go to a place, the airline itself has a decent

57
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:32,760
amount of data.

58
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:38,120
The majority of new United routes are to destinations already served by another one of their hubs.

59
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:42,760
For example, one of the routes that United added in 2015 was from Denver to Southwest

60
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:47,080
Oregon Regional Airport which was already served by its San Francisco hub.

61
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:51,120
Given that, United already had data on how many people flew there from Denver via San

62
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:54,320
Francisco and would therefore take a non-stop flight.

63
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:58,660
United also flies to a number of places non-stop from Denver that it doesn't from San Francisco

64
00:03:58,660 --> 00:04:03,480
such as Albuquerque, Sioux Falls, and Wichita that would now have a one-stop option to Southwest

65
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:06,300
Oregon Regional Airport rather than a two-stop.

66
00:04:06,300 --> 00:04:10,440
For brand new destinations though, especially long-haul ones, United doesn't have its

67
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:14,100
own passenger figures so they have to figure out how many people want to go there through

68
00:04:14,100 --> 00:04:15,500
other means.

69
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:19,860
One of the great assets that travel booking sites like Expedia, Google Flights, and Skyscanner

70
00:04:19,860 --> 00:04:23,160
have is that they know where people want to fly.

71
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:27,080
They know which city pairs people search for flights between and many sell this incredibly

72
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:30,180
valuable data to market research companies and airlines.

73
00:04:30,180 --> 00:04:34,580
Skyscanner, for example, knows that 190,000 people a year search for a flight between

74
00:04:34,580 --> 00:04:39,060
Birmingham and Hong Kong, 420,000 people a year search for a flight between Delhi and

75
00:04:39,060 --> 00:04:43,780
Auckland, 1.1 million people a year search for a flight between Bangkok and Barcelona,

76
00:04:43,780 --> 00:04:47,580
and 1.4 million people a year search for a flight between London and Kochi.

77
00:04:47,580 --> 00:04:51,520
These all represent big opportunities that airlines have yet to act on.

78
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:54,860
People are still making these trips but having to connect.

79
00:04:54,860 --> 00:04:59,300
Creating a non-stop flight on any of these routes would capture a decent amount of the

80
00:04:59,300 --> 00:05:00,300
traffic.

81
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:03,460
The reason some of these popular routes do not have a non-stop service, though, comes

82
00:05:03,460 --> 00:05:07,380
down to that second factor—how much people are willing to pay.

83
00:05:07,380 --> 00:05:11,960
People usually pay a premium to fly on non-stop flights, but there's a maximum to how much

84
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:14,340
extra people will pay for the convenience.

85
00:05:14,340 --> 00:05:19,740
In October, 2017, United launched a new non-stop route from Los Angeles to Singapore to much

86
00:05:19,740 --> 00:05:20,740
fanfare.

87
00:05:20,740 --> 00:05:23,900
This would be the airline's longest ever route, the only non-stop connection between

88
00:05:23,900 --> 00:05:27,360
the two cities, and they expected it to do great.

89
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:29,580
The problem, though, was the competition.

90
00:05:29,580 --> 00:05:33,580
Currently, round-ship connecting flights between Los Angeles and Singapore are on sale

91
00:05:33,580 --> 00:05:36,900
for as little as $444.

92
00:05:36,900 --> 00:05:40,860
At the time that United was flying this route, they were supposedly even less.

93
00:05:40,860 --> 00:05:45,020
United just couldn't come close to the prices that others were offering and, exactly a year

94
00:05:45,020 --> 00:05:47,180
after this route was launched, it was cancelled.

95
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:51,380
It wasn't a complete failure—they ended up just adding a second frequency to Singapore

96
00:05:51,380 --> 00:05:55,940
from San Francisco—but it is an example of a route that looked great on paper but

97
00:05:55,940 --> 00:05:57,700
didn't work out in reality.

98
00:05:57,700 --> 00:06:01,160
It was a similar reason that likely led to the cancellation of the American flight from

99
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:05,460
Chicago to Beijing mentioned at the beginning—it was just too tough to compete against the

100
00:06:05,460 --> 00:06:10,340
low fares of Asian airlines and, as a result, American's planes were crossing the Pacific

101
00:06:10,340 --> 00:06:11,500
empty.

102
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:15,580
In all, airlines need to figure out what people will pay for a route to figure out if it's

103
00:06:15,580 --> 00:06:19,860
profitable and also if it's going to be the most profitable route they can add.

104
00:06:19,860 --> 00:06:23,660
Part of the reason why American and Delta might not have added a non-stop flight to

105
00:06:23,660 --> 00:06:28,180
Singapore is because they can make more money using the same plane elsewhere.

106
00:06:28,180 --> 00:06:32,540
United essentially has now used up four of its planes to fly its two daily flights to

107
00:06:32,540 --> 00:06:33,540
Singapore.

108
00:06:33,540 --> 00:06:38,580
They're charging a minimum of about $800 to fly round-trip on this 16-hour flight whereas,

109
00:06:38,580 --> 00:06:43,620
from the east coast, United is also charging about $800 to fly round-trip on their 6-hour

110
00:06:43,620 --> 00:06:46,060
flight from DC to London.

111
00:06:46,060 --> 00:06:49,740
Airlines need to consider whether, out of a whole world of options, they're picking

112
00:06:49,740 --> 00:06:52,380
the best one when adding a route.

113
00:06:52,380 --> 00:06:56,220
Beyond these two main factors, there are others involved in whether or not a route

114
00:06:56,220 --> 00:06:57,220
will work financially.

115
00:06:57,220 --> 00:07:01,780
For example, while a certain route might work for one airline, the exact same route might

116
00:07:01,780 --> 00:07:03,440
not work for another.

117
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:08,580
From Australia, there are three routes to mainland China operated by Australian airlines—Qantas

118
00:07:08,580 --> 00:07:12,740
from Sydney to Beijing and Shanghai and Jetstar from Melbourne to Zhenzhou.

119
00:07:12,740 --> 00:07:19,020
Meanwhile, from mainland China, there are 43 routes to Australia operated by Chinese

120
00:07:19,020 --> 00:07:20,020
airlines.

121
00:07:20,020 --> 00:07:23,940
This extreme imbalance exists because people tend to prefer to fly on airlines from their

122
00:07:23,940 --> 00:07:28,100
home country, especially in cases like this where the language is different.

123
00:07:28,100 --> 00:07:33,420
There are far more Chinese traveling to Australia than Australians traveling to China so, therefore,

124
00:07:33,420 --> 00:07:37,640
there are far more Chinese airlines flying to Australia than vice versa.

125
00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:41,220
Of course there are other factors involved such as, given the lower cost of living in

126
00:07:41,220 --> 00:07:45,740
China, Chinese airlines have lower labor costs and are therefore able to offer lower fares,

127
00:07:45,740 --> 00:07:50,160
but when an airline is figuring out whether a route will work, the nationality and directionality

128
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:52,660
of travelers does matter.

129
00:07:52,660 --> 00:07:57,120
Sometimes though, a route is launched that just doesn't make financial sense, at least

130
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:58,820
independently.

131
00:07:58,820 --> 00:08:02,840
Sometimes airlines launch routes primarily to slow the advance of a competitor.

132
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:08,180
For example, on September 6th, 2017, Wow Air, the Icelandic budget airline, announced that

133
00:08:08,180 --> 00:08:11,100
it would start flying from Reykjavik to Dallas.

134
00:08:11,100 --> 00:08:15,260
Less than a week later, Icelandair, the other major Icelandic airline, announced that they

135
00:08:15,260 --> 00:08:18,260
too would start flying from Reykjavik to Dallas.

136
00:08:18,260 --> 00:08:22,420
About a month after that, American Airlines announced that they would also start flying

137
00:08:22,420 --> 00:08:24,140
to Reykjavik from Dallas.

138
00:08:24,140 --> 00:08:28,660
Now, Dallas is very much a fortress hub for American Airlines.

139
00:08:28,660 --> 00:08:32,880
That is, they control a huge percentage of the market share there and they want it to

140
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:33,880
stay that way.

141
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:38,620
They didn't want their customers to start flying on Wow or Icelandair to Iceland or,

142
00:08:38,620 --> 00:08:40,500
more importantly, beyond to Europe.

143
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:45,240
While Iceland has seen a significant increase in tourism traffic over the past decade, there

144
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:49,320
are a few signs signaling that this route addition might have been more for competitive

145
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:53,060
purposes than because it was the best financial choice independently.

146
00:08:53,060 --> 00:08:57,740
The first is the suspicious timing—announcing quite soon after the two other airlines did—and

147
00:08:57,740 --> 00:09:01,320
the other is that it really doesn't make sense for American's one and only Iceland

148
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:03,600
flight to leave from Dallas.

149
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:07,480
This requires all connecting travelers from the east half of the country to backtrack

150
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:10,420
to Dallas if they want to fly on American to Iceland.

151
00:09:10,420 --> 00:09:14,200
The airline has, in recent years, concentrated most of their transatlantic flights going

152
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:19,040
to leisure-oriented destinations, such as Iceland, to their Philadelphia hub but, in

153
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:23,520
this case, it was clearly most likely more about stopping Wow and Icelandair.

154
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:25,900
In this, American was successful.

155
00:09:25,900 --> 00:09:29,120
Both of its competitors have since stopped flying to Dallas.

156
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:33,000
While this and other similar routes might not make money themselves, overall they're

157
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:37,400
a right decision for the company since they can force a competitor out of the market and,

158
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:41,840
in this case, passengers that might have connected on Wow or Icelandair from Dallas to Europe

159
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:44,520
would now take American's transatlantic flights.

160
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:49,380
So, once all that analysis happens, once an airline decides that it's a good idea to

161
00:09:49,380 --> 00:09:53,880
launch a route, it still doesn't mean that an airline can go ahead and start flying.

162
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:56,640
Obviously, they need a spare plane.

163
00:09:56,640 --> 00:10:01,360
That can either come from another route cancellation or through a new aircraft delivery.

164
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:06,280
For example, United's new route from San Francisco to Tahiti, with relatively low demand,

165
00:10:06,280 --> 00:10:10,240
required its smallest long-haul plane—the 787-8 Dreamliner.

166
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:14,800
One of those only became available when a new 787-9 was delivered from Boeing that replaced

167
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:19,080
an older 787-8 on the busier San Francisco to Munich route.

168
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:23,320
Airlines also need gate space and, at some busy airports, a landing slot.

169
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:28,200
For many international routes, airlines also need government approval to begin a new flight.

170
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:33,160
There's plenty more uninteresting bureaucracy but then, sometime, usually years after an

171
00:10:33,160 --> 00:10:36,980
airline first examines whether a route will make sense, the first plane will take off

172
00:10:36,980 --> 00:10:39,180
between those two airports.

173
00:10:39,180 --> 00:10:43,260
No matter how much work is put into analyzing whether a route will work, reality always

174
00:10:43,260 --> 00:10:45,380
has unforeseen variables.

175
00:10:45,380 --> 00:10:49,520
The true test of whether a route will work is actually flying the route.

176
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:52,060
Once that happens, airlines will evaluate its performance.

177
00:10:52,060 --> 00:10:55,140
If it's making enough money, it will keep flying.

178
00:10:55,140 --> 00:10:57,540
If it's not, it usually will not.

179
00:10:57,540 --> 00:11:01,580
This is all part of airlines' continuous cycle of planning, launching, and evaluating

180
00:11:01,580 --> 00:11:06,420
routes in order to find the few that can actually turn a profit in this notoriously financially

181
00:11:06,420 --> 00:11:09,140
difficult industry.

182
00:11:09,140 --> 00:11:13,600
If you're watching this video, there are two things that you almost certainly like—documentaries

183
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:14,600
and aviation.

184
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:18,600
Therefore, I would imagine you would like this documentary on CuriosityStream about

185
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:21,700
the whole process that it takes to make an Airbus A380 wing.

186
00:11:21,700 --> 00:11:25,540
It's a fascinating look at all the work that goes into producing what is perhaps the

187
00:11:25,540 --> 00:11:27,940
most important element of that plane.

188
00:11:27,940 --> 00:11:32,220
This is one of over 2,400 documentaries that you can watch on CuriosityStream which is

189
00:11:32,220 --> 00:11:37,660
compatible with iOS, Android, Xbox One, Chromecast, Apple TV, and plenty more platforms.

190
00:11:37,700 --> 00:11:42,540
It's also quite reasonably priced at only $2.99 per month for unlimited access.

191
00:11:42,540 --> 00:11:47,360
