8460	12160	Airlines can make a lot of money by flying to the right places.
12160	16640	British Airways, for example, long ago cemented themselves as the leader on the London Heathrow
16640	22160	to New York JFK route and flying between these two airports now earns them over $1 billion
22160	23160	per year.
23160	26320	That's more than any airline makes on any other route in the world.
26360	31320	Conversely, though, airlines can lose a lot of money by flying to the wrong places.
31320	35520	American Airlines, for example, recently cancelled their Chicago to Beijing flight as it was
35520	38400	losing them tens of millions of dollars per year.
38400	42480	Now, the fact that this route failed might be puzzling considering it flew between the
42480	45720	world's 50th and the world's 7th largest city.
45720	50520	Even more, they were flying the 787A streamliner—the smallest plane they could on this route.
50520	53880	Nonetheless, it was truly a financial disaster.
53880	59200	The airlines said that, in terms of annual revenue, the route was $80 million away from
59200	60200	their target.
60200	64280	The truth is that deciding where to fly is a lot more complicated than pairing up the
64280	65280	largest cities.
65280	69040	It's an art that people spend their whole lives mastering and the difference between
69040	72780	an airline that's good at route planning and one that's bad at it can be the difference
72780	75520	between a profitable airline and a defunct one.
75520	83000	In 2015, the big three airlines in the US—American, Delta, and United—launched 101 new routes.
83000	86400	These included everything from United's new 30-minute regional flight between Chicago
86400	90920	and Kalamazoo to Delta's new Trans-Pacific service between Los Angeles and Shanghai.
90920	93880	Some of these 101 survived, some did not.
93880	98280	Of the routes that Delta launched in 2015, about 70% still fly today.
98280	102720	There were some big, noticeable cancellations from their 2015 launched routes including
102720	107000	Orlando to Sao Paulo, New York to Manchester, and Philadelphia to London.
107000	112320	Meanwhile, American Airlines did a little better with 76% of their 2015 routes surviving
112320	113320	today.
113320	117920	Still, they clearly had some expensive failures with routes like Dallas to Quito, Miami to
117920	120240	Frankfurt, and New York to Birmingham.
120240	125800	United Airlines, though, has a noticeably higher 85% of those 2015 routes still flying
125800	126800	today.
126800	131400	The only four routes from 2015 that didn't work out were Houston to Peoria, Newark to
131400	134400	Newcastle, Dallas to Moline, and Denver to San Jose.
134400	139380	Now, it's worth noting that the survival of routes is not the one definitive measure
139380	142560	of how good airlines are at route planning.
142560	146460	Different companies might have different risk tolerances, they might wait out a route longer,
146460	150380	there are a lot of other factors involved, but there is other evidence that United is
150380	152380	good at route planning.
152380	157400	There are a number of destinations that United is the sole American airline to operate to.
157400	162020	Just looking at long-haul destinations, that includes Melbourne, Tahiti, Taipei, Chengdu,
162020	166080	Delhi, Mumbai, Naples, Porto, and Stockholm.
166080	170440	In some of these cases, there might be just enough traffic to support one US airline flying
170440	172960	there and United got there first.
172960	177080	In addition, there are plenty of routes that United flies without non-stop competition
177080	182720	like Denver to Tokyo, Houston to Rio de Janeiro, DC to Zurich, and Chicago to Edinburgh.
182720	187080	Many of these potentially riskier routes have survived for years so they're clearly good
187080	188080	at route planning.
188080	192640	They're clearly good at finding the opportunities both big and small.
192880	197080	According to United, the two major factors they look at when deciding where to fly are
197080	200680	how many people want to go there and how much are they willing to pay.
200680	204440	These questions are easy to ask but extremely difficult to answer.
204440	207160	That's why it's people's whole jobs.
207160	211440	For figuring out how many people want to go to a place, the airline itself has a decent
211440	212760	amount of data.
212760	218120	The majority of new United routes are to destinations already served by another one of their hubs.
218120	222760	For example, one of the routes that United added in 2015 was from Denver to Southwest
222760	227080	Oregon Regional Airport which was already served by its San Francisco hub.
227080	231120	Given that, United already had data on how many people flew there from Denver via San
231120	234320	Francisco and would therefore take a non-stop flight.
234320	238660	United also flies to a number of places non-stop from Denver that it doesn't from San Francisco
238660	243480	such as Albuquerque, Sioux Falls, and Wichita that would now have a one-stop option to Southwest
243480	246300	Oregon Regional Airport rather than a two-stop.
246300	250440	For brand new destinations though, especially long-haul ones, United doesn't have its
250440	254100	own passenger figures so they have to figure out how many people want to go there through
254100	255500	other means.
255500	259860	One of the great assets that travel booking sites like Expedia, Google Flights, and Skyscanner
259860	263160	have is that they know where people want to fly.
263160	267080	They know which city pairs people search for flights between and many sell this incredibly
267080	270180	valuable data to market research companies and airlines.
270180	274580	Skyscanner, for example, knows that 190,000 people a year search for a flight between
274580	279060	Birmingham and Hong Kong, 420,000 people a year search for a flight between Delhi and
279060	283780	Auckland, 1.1 million people a year search for a flight between Bangkok and Barcelona,
283780	287580	and 1.4 million people a year search for a flight between London and Kochi.
287580	291520	These all represent big opportunities that airlines have yet to act on.
291520	294860	People are still making these trips but having to connect.
294860	299300	Creating a non-stop flight on any of these routes would capture a decent amount of the
299300	300300	traffic.
300300	303460	The reason some of these popular routes do not have a non-stop service, though, comes
303460	307380	down to that second factor—how much people are willing to pay.
307380	311960	People usually pay a premium to fly on non-stop flights, but there's a maximum to how much
311960	314340	extra people will pay for the convenience.
314340	319740	In October, 2017, United launched a new non-stop route from Los Angeles to Singapore to much
319740	320740	fanfare.
320740	323900	This would be the airline's longest ever route, the only non-stop connection between
323900	327360	the two cities, and they expected it to do great.
327360	329580	The problem, though, was the competition.
329580	333580	Currently, round-ship connecting flights between Los Angeles and Singapore are on sale
333580	336900	for as little as $444.
336900	340860	At the time that United was flying this route, they were supposedly even less.
340860	345020	United just couldn't come close to the prices that others were offering and, exactly a year
345020	347180	after this route was launched, it was cancelled.
347180	351380	It wasn't a complete failure—they ended up just adding a second frequency to Singapore
351380	355940	from San Francisco—but it is an example of a route that looked great on paper but
355940	357700	didn't work out in reality.
357700	361160	It was a similar reason that likely led to the cancellation of the American flight from
361160	365460	Chicago to Beijing mentioned at the beginning—it was just too tough to compete against the
365460	370340	low fares of Asian airlines and, as a result, American's planes were crossing the Pacific
370340	371500	empty.
371500	375580	In all, airlines need to figure out what people will pay for a route to figure out if it's
375580	379860	profitable and also if it's going to be the most profitable route they can add.
379860	383660	Part of the reason why American and Delta might not have added a non-stop flight to
383660	388180	Singapore is because they can make more money using the same plane elsewhere.
388180	392540	United essentially has now used up four of its planes to fly its two daily flights to
392540	393540	Singapore.
393540	398580	They're charging a minimum of about $800 to fly round-trip on this 16-hour flight whereas,
398580	403620	from the east coast, United is also charging about $800 to fly round-trip on their 6-hour
403620	406060	flight from DC to London.
406060	409740	Airlines need to consider whether, out of a whole world of options, they're picking
409740	412380	the best one when adding a route.
412380	416220	Beyond these two main factors, there are others involved in whether or not a route
416220	417220	will work financially.
417220	421780	For example, while a certain route might work for one airline, the exact same route might
421780	423440	not work for another.
423440	428580	From Australia, there are three routes to mainland China operated by Australian airlines—Qantas
428580	432740	from Sydney to Beijing and Shanghai and Jetstar from Melbourne to Zhenzhou.
432740	439020	Meanwhile, from mainland China, there are 43 routes to Australia operated by Chinese
439020	440020	airlines.
440020	443940	This extreme imbalance exists because people tend to prefer to fly on airlines from their
443940	448100	home country, especially in cases like this where the language is different.
448100	453420	There are far more Chinese traveling to Australia than Australians traveling to China so, therefore,
453420	457640	there are far more Chinese airlines flying to Australia than vice versa.
457640	461220	Of course there are other factors involved such as, given the lower cost of living in
461220	465740	China, Chinese airlines have lower labor costs and are therefore able to offer lower fares,
465740	470160	but when an airline is figuring out whether a route will work, the nationality and directionality
470160	472660	of travelers does matter.
472660	477120	Sometimes though, a route is launched that just doesn't make financial sense, at least
477120	478820	independently.
478820	482840	Sometimes airlines launch routes primarily to slow the advance of a competitor.
482840	488180	For example, on September 6th, 2017, Wow Air, the Icelandic budget airline, announced that
488180	491100	it would start flying from Reykjavik to Dallas.
491100	495260	Less than a week later, Icelandair, the other major Icelandic airline, announced that they
495260	498260	too would start flying from Reykjavik to Dallas.
498260	502420	About a month after that, American Airlines announced that they would also start flying
502420	504140	to Reykjavik from Dallas.
504140	508660	Now, Dallas is very much a fortress hub for American Airlines.
508660	512880	That is, they control a huge percentage of the market share there and they want it to
512880	513880	stay that way.
513880	518620	They didn't want their customers to start flying on Wow or Icelandair to Iceland or,
518620	520500	more importantly, beyond to Europe.
520500	525240	While Iceland has seen a significant increase in tourism traffic over the past decade, there
525240	529320	are a few signs signaling that this route addition might have been more for competitive
529320	533060	purposes than because it was the best financial choice independently.
533060	537740	The first is the suspicious timing—announcing quite soon after the two other airlines did—and
537740	541320	the other is that it really doesn't make sense for American's one and only Iceland
541320	543600	flight to leave from Dallas.
543600	547480	This requires all connecting travelers from the east half of the country to backtrack
547480	550420	to Dallas if they want to fly on American to Iceland.
550420	554200	The airline has, in recent years, concentrated most of their transatlantic flights going
554200	559040	to leisure-oriented destinations, such as Iceland, to their Philadelphia hub but, in
559040	563520	this case, it was clearly most likely more about stopping Wow and Icelandair.
563520	565900	In this, American was successful.
565900	569120	Both of its competitors have since stopped flying to Dallas.
569120	573000	While this and other similar routes might not make money themselves, overall they're
573000	577400	a right decision for the company since they can force a competitor out of the market and,
577400	581840	in this case, passengers that might have connected on Wow or Icelandair from Dallas to Europe
581840	584520	would now take American's transatlantic flights.
584520	589380	So, once all that analysis happens, once an airline decides that it's a good idea to
589380	593880	launch a route, it still doesn't mean that an airline can go ahead and start flying.
593880	596640	Obviously, they need a spare plane.
596640	601360	That can either come from another route cancellation or through a new aircraft delivery.
601360	606280	For example, United's new route from San Francisco to Tahiti, with relatively low demand,
606280	610240	required its smallest long-haul plane—the 787-8 Dreamliner.
610240	614800	One of those only became available when a new 787-9 was delivered from Boeing that replaced
614800	619080	an older 787-8 on the busier San Francisco to Munich route.
619080	623320	Airlines also need gate space and, at some busy airports, a landing slot.
623320	628200	For many international routes, airlines also need government approval to begin a new flight.
628200	633160	There's plenty more uninteresting bureaucracy but then, sometime, usually years after an
633160	636980	airline first examines whether a route will make sense, the first plane will take off
636980	639180	between those two airports.
639180	643260	No matter how much work is put into analyzing whether a route will work, reality always
643260	645380	has unforeseen variables.
645380	649520	The true test of whether a route will work is actually flying the route.
649520	652060	Once that happens, airlines will evaluate its performance.
652060	655140	If it's making enough money, it will keep flying.
655140	657540	If it's not, it usually will not.
657540	661580	This is all part of airlines' continuous cycle of planning, launching, and evaluating
661580	666420	routes in order to find the few that can actually turn a profit in this notoriously financially
666420	669140	difficult industry.
669140	673600	If you're watching this video, there are two things that you almost certainly like—documentaries
673600	674600	and aviation.
674600	678600	Therefore, I would imagine you would like this documentary on CuriosityStream about
678600	681700	the whole process that it takes to make an Airbus A380 wing.
681700	685540	It's a fascinating look at all the work that goes into producing what is perhaps the
685540	687940	most important element of that plane.
