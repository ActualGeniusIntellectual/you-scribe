0	6400	This is Wixom Lake—home to a humble marina, a waterfront church camp, a lakeside campground,
6400	10560	and a host of small neighborhoods where front yards connect to the road network and backyards
10560	17120	connect to docks. But Wixom Lake isn't actually a lake. Rather, it's a river—the Tintabawassee
17120	22960	River—whose flow happens to be suddenly upended by the Edenville Dam, creating a human-made
22960	28880	reservoir. But whatever you call it—a lake, a river, a reservoir—this nondescript body of
28880	35040	water in a nondescript section of central Michigan has real problems that start and will end with the
35040	41120	dam. Edenville Dam is entirely unexceptional. Until 2020, even the most knowledgeable
41120	45920	michigan d'heure would have a hard time placing it on a map. In fact, perhaps if anyone had heard
45920	51200	of it, it was because of what the dam was no longer allowed to do—generate electricity.
51200	58160	Its claim to fame was its lack of function. In the United States, there are some 91,000 dams.
58160	63120	In Michigan, there are about 2,600. Each and every last one was built with a purpose, or,
63120	68480	to further justify cost, multiple. The Hoover Dam would stop flooding in the Imperial Valley,
68480	72640	as well as provide water storage and power. Grand Coulee would provide electricity and
72640	77360	irrigation water. Glen Canyon, the thinking went, would air condition the southwest.
77360	83360	A far humbler dam in comparison, Edenville has a purpose too. Composed not of concrete but of
83360	88880	earth, a combination of clay, rock, and sand, running over 6,000 feet or 1,800 meters wide but
88880	94480	standing only 52 feet or 18 meters tall at its highest point, it was built to provide electricity
94480	99920	for its surrounding communities. With twin 2.4 megawatt generators, Edenville at its peak output
99920	105440	can only provide around 0.36% of the power of Glen Canyon Dam, but that's still enough power
105440	111440	to feasibly electrify the 34,000 households of Midland County, Michigan. Not bad for a dam built
111440	117200	with private funds some century ago. But that core case for its existence quickly waned when
117200	122480	its owner and operator, Boyce Hydropower LLC, received a federal order to shut down production
122480	127760	in 2018 on account of its inability to meet federal regulations. In the ruling's wake,
127760	132080	a power struggle between dam owners, lakeside property owners, and regulators had seen the
132080	136720	lake's levels rise and fall as the dam let more or less water through, but generally,
136720	143600	they sat below operating levels. Then, beginning on May 14th, 2020, and intensifying on the 18th,
143600	149440	it rained. First, it was manageable—by midnight at the start of the 18th, the water level still
149440	154480	sat below its lower operational limit—in other words, the water still hadn't reached the level
154480	160240	that allowed for power generation, let alone flood levels—but that quickly changed the following
160240	164960	day. As an incredible three inches or eight centimeters of rain fell,
164960	170960	lake levels rose nearly two feet or 60 centimeters in the next 24 hours, then another foot in the
170960	177280	next six hours, then another foot in the next six hours, then, along an unremarkable section
177280	183280	of dam along its eastern edge, it went. Now a river unleashed, the waters overwhelmed the
183280	189040	next dam down, flooding 2,500 structures, racking up nearly $200 million in damages,
189040	195520	and causing 10,000 to evacuate. No one died, but a lake few knew of beforehand now made
195520	200480	national news, and a dam long overlooked suddenly became the center of attention.
201040	206720	As the water receded, the forensic investigation began. The findings were surprising—the dam
206720	211520	hadn't overtopped. The water levels hadn't reached higher than the height of its lip.
211520	217680	It hadn't eroded, either. Rather, it had become unstable—it had fallen victim to a phenomenon
217680	222160	called static liquefaction—essentially, the process of progressive loading of the
222160	227520	soil to the point that it no longer functions as a solid, but rather, a liquid. Dam failure
227520	231680	due to static liquefaction is rare, and as engineers have readily admitted, it's not
231680	237920	well understood nor well documented. In this way, then, the Enville Dam failure was rather singular—
237920	242960	something rarely observed, something that's easier to understand as a freak accident rather
242960	248960	than a systematic failure. But it'd be a mistake to chalk the collapse up to bad luck.
248960	254640	Alternatively, the dam had real flaws of existential proportion that it seemed the
254640	259680	Federal Energy Regulatory Commission revoke its license. Along with compliance issues and
259680	264480	operational procedures, the major issue that federal regulators took with the Enville Dam
264480	269760	was its inability to deal with heavy floodwater—that its spillways, the very structures
269760	274560	present along practically every dam to protect it from flooding, were too small.
275360	280240	While dams may not look it, they're incredibly fragile when water doesn't move through it,
280240	286080	as designed. Capable of holding back millions of acre-feet, just the slightest of spillovers
286080	291760	are disastrous. Even a couple extra inches of water height above a concrete dam will kick off
291760	298000	a calamitous cascade of erosion eating away at the structure's backside and base. On an earthen dam,
298000	302880	like Enville, water will seep into the structure and potentially erode it from the interior.
302880	307760	Should it overtop a dam of any sort, the unexpected pressure and weight is likely to
307760	313200	rip away at the structure. So, to ensure water stays at a low enough level,
313200	319680	dams have spillways. These are essentially extra throughput capacity. While normally water routes
319680	324400	through a dam's gates, spillways provide an extra route in case that's not enough to lower
324400	330000	the reservoir at the same speed that it's rising due to rain. Now, to pass modern federal standards,
330000	334880	Enville's two spillways would need to move enough water to avoid overtopping in the event of a
334880	340160	probable maximum flood—a theoretical flood event calculated by forecasters that would represent the
340160	345360	most severe combination of hydrological and weather conditions likely in the area—conditions
345360	350480	not so dissimilar to the rainstorm that rolled over Michigan in May of 2020.
350480	356320	Enville never actually overtopped, of course, but it may well have if not for its earlier failure.
356320	362000	Water, after all, was rising. And while operators had opened the overmatched spillways, they could
362000	367360	only safely raise the gates up to seven feet as any higher would endanger the structure and its
367360	373680	staff. Perhaps, then, it was less the fault of bad luck, and more so an outcome made inevitable
373680	378480	by the fact that the dam and its operators just couldn't keep up with the upkeep.
379200	383680	Now, at first glance, one might not consider Enville a regulatory failure,
383680	387840	as the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission attempted to get its owners to add spillway
387840	392880	capacity in a way that might have mitigated the eventual collapse, but one must consider that
392880	400000	such a story is far from unique. Across the nation, there are some 7,999 other dams that
400000	406400	are considered deficient, either in design or in maintenance, and then of those, there are 403 that
406400	411760	have the fatal pair. A condition rating of unsatisfactory, indicating that quote,
411760	416720	a dam's safety deficiency is recognized that requires immediate or emergency remedial action
416720	422080	for problem resolution, along with a hazard rating of high, meaning, in the event of failure,
422080	429440	one or more fatalities is not only possible, but probable. Each of these 403 is in a situation like
429440	435120	Lake Hodges Dam in San Diego, California. Here, the more than century-old structure is quite
435120	439920	literally cracking and crumbling, while also threatened by a known lack of adequate spillway
439920	445120	capacity for the maximum probable flood scenario. If the structure were to fail, it'd take less than
445120	450800	two hours for this entire swath of land to get inundated with water as much as 23 feet or 7
450800	455840	meters deep, leaving dangerously little evacuation time for the thousands of individuals living on
455840	461280	both banks of the San Diogito River, informing the regulator's belief of the inevitability of
461360	467520	fatality. Looking past the regulatory failures and design deficiencies and exceptional weather,
467520	473520	what fundamentally makes these 403 dams so dangerous is the fact that they're just, simply,
473520	480160	old. Age issues are always tricky as they only ever escalate, but, inconceivably, this isn't like
480160	486400	any other age issue—it's worse. That's because, right now, there is a massive, disproportionate
486400	490400	surge of dams getting to the age where age itself is an issue.
490400	496560	The impetus of this surge was a dam-building boom that occurred some 50 or 70 years ago.
496560	503120	Between 1960 and 1980 alone, some 31,000 of the structures were constructed in the United States,
503120	508800	representing more than a third of those standing today. And this was hardly confined to the US.
508800	513520	Around the world, dams were perceived as the perfect solution to provide copious quantities
513520	519600	of cheap, reliable, geopolitically safe energy. The World Bank, in its role financing development-
519600	524400	oriented infrastructure projects in low- and medium-income countries, was a major force in
524400	529840	enabling the development of not just dams, but large dams around the world—the kind that would
529840	534960	reshape entire regions. The thought was that a country would benefit from the employment created
534960	539920	by the construction of such structures, then, once complete, they'd have so much cheap electricity
539920	544480	that an industrial sector would pop up that would provide further employment. Meanwhile,
544480	548880	dams could also help stabilize a water supply, mitigate floods, and help with agricultural
548880	554320	irrigation, so with copious theoretical benefits, hundreds of millions of dollars flowed from World
554320	559920	Bank coffers and they became the number one financier of large dams worldwide.
559920	565600	But each time a dam is built, a geography is altered significantly. For example,
565600	570320	when the Kariba Dam's gates were closed for the first time and the flow of the Zambezi restricted,
570320	576000	that started the formation of what's now known as Lake Kariba. These reservoirs are a fundamental
576000	580800	component of dams—they provide the pressure to turn a turbine for power, and they're the natural
580800	587040	byproduct of stabilizing downstream flow—but they're also massive. Lake Kariba, in fact,
587040	593360	is over twice the size of the nation of Luxembourg. Or put another way, the Kariba Dam removed more
593360	600720	than two Luxembourgs worth of land from Zimbabwe and Zambia. 58,000 people lived on that riverside,
600720	606480	but, as water levels rose, they had to leave the only homes they'd ever known to decamp to less
606480	611920	familiar, less fertile land. Little to no compensation was given to these individuals,
611920	617440	and it took 50 years for any sort of meaningful community rehabilitation efforts to start.
618000	623440	This story was replicated essentially anywhere the World Bank developed a dam. In Guatemala,
623440	630240	the Chixoy Dam deplaced 3,500, and 444 were murdered by the government for resisting their
630240	634800	forced displacement. On the border between Argentina and Paraguay, the Yacreta Dam
634800	640160	displaced upwards of 20,000, again without any meaningful compensation. And problems
640160	645840	persist beyond just displacement—the Yacreta Dam propagated malaria and dengue fever by enlarging
645840	650640	the mosquito habitat, and simultaneously led to the extinction of two species of snail
650640	656480	due to habitat destruction. This is all to say, dams are not some simple device that
656480	663840	effortlessly translates water into electricity—they have a colossal impact. On average, this impact is
663840	669600	felt by poor rural communities, so governments and developers have long found their cries easy
669600	675440	to ignore. But through the years, as the cases counted up, public pressure was mounting on the
675440	682080	World Bank. In 1994, 2,000 NGOs signed the Manabelli Declaration calling for a full-scale
682080	688480	moratorium on dam financing, citing the staggering statistic that 10 million people had been
688480	693920	displaced from their homes by their actions. So, in response to this and other public pushback,
693920	698480	the World Bank partnered with the International Union for Conservation of Nature to form the
698480	703760	World Commission on Dams, a multidisciplinary panel of experts that would study past projects
703760	710080	in order to develop a framework for future ones and answer, once and for all, how to build a good
710080	717680	dam. The answer was perhaps not what the World Bank expected. What the report said, across 404
717680	723680	pages, was that, in sum, historically, the benefits of dams had been overstated and the
723680	730240	costs had been understated. That's to say, dams simply were not as good as previously thought.
730800	735280	While this answer had been coming into focus for decades, this was the most definitive,
735280	740800	official instance of it to date, and in response, both the World Bank and the world more broadly
740800	746240	slowed down its dam development. This coincided with a naturally waning financial case for
746240	751360	hydropower. It's far from the cheapest source of electricity in the US—multiple fossil fuel
751360	756320	sources are cheaper, and even solar and wind now beat its prices. And it's not like its higher
756320	761120	price can be strongly justified on environmental grounds—even ignoring habitat and home
761120	766320	destruction, the creation of a reservoir leads to the death of all the plants it drowns out, which,
766320	772080	in many cases, leads to as much or more greenhouse gas emissions in the first decade of operations
772080	776480	as a coal-fired power plant producing the equivalent amount of electricity.
776480	783360	So, in all, that era of rapid dam development is now bookended, leaving a huge quantity of
783360	790720	aging dams that, perhaps most dangerously, are increasingly unprofitable. You see, the confluence
790720	796320	between financial well-being and physical peril stems from the fact that 65% of dams in the US
796320	802000	are owned not by governments, but by private entities. The failed Edenville Dam was one such
802000	806800	example—after being passed around between companies for decades, in 2006 it ended up in
806800	812720	the hands of Boyce Hydropower LLC. Boyce was a small company whose operations were limited to
812720	818320	the ownership of a few area dams, and that was as intended—they operated more as an investment
818320	823920	vehicle, in fact, than a company. That's because it was owned by the trust of William Dixon Boyce,
823920	828880	the founder of the Boy Scouts of America, meaning, after his death, his wealth was put into this
828880	833520	legal entity designed to manage it according to his wishes, and therefore the trust's managers
833520	839600	made investments to maintain and grow the wealth, including, in this case, buying dams in Michigan.
839600	843120	Theoretically, dams could be a good investment since they're assets with
843120	847920	relatively low operational costs that provide stable, ongoing income through electricity
847920	852640	production. In this case, however, Edenville was bought at a particularly low price since
852640	858320	it was known from the start that it'd need some imminent and expensive upgrades. Nearly a century
858320	863760	on from its construction, the structure no longer conformed to federal spillway capacity guidelines.
863760	868080	After conducting hundreds of thousands of dollars of design work, Boyce finally determined that it
868160	873520	would cost some $8 million to conform to federal standards, which the company said they simply
873520	879360	could not afford. Therefore, they just didn't make the upgrades, and their operator's license
879360	884320	was revoked. The wide-scale private ownership of these pieces of public infrastructure
884320	889600	makes this situation far too feasible. Companies have assets that are becoming less and less
889600	894240	valuable as their economic case wanes, and therefore willingness to maintain or upgrade
894240	900320	them is low. So, there's an overwhelming surge of dams getting dangerously old with increasingly
900320	905840	disinterested owners, meaning dams are becoming less equipped to deal with the worst-case flood
905840	911760	scenarios. But the ultimate crux of the dam issue stems from the fact that global temperatures are
911760	917120	rising. Warmer air holds more water vapor, meaning it creates stronger storms with more
917120	922560	precipitation. The sixth IPCC report determined that the worst storms of a given decade in a
922560	928240	given place are already 6.7% wetter, and if global temperatures rise by 2 degrees Celsius,
928240	932960	as now seems all but inevitable, this intensity increase will be as much as 14%.
933760	938800	And the intensity increase is even greater for the worst storms of a 50-year span, meaning,
938800	944400	not only are bad storms getting wetter, but the maximum potential of the absolute worst storms
944400	950480	is intensifying even faster. Dams were designed to handle the worst-case scenario from decades,
950480	956320	even over a century ago, but now that worst-case scenario is rapidly and meaningfully escalated,
956320	961680	and the dams are getting worse. The worst-case scenario has not happened
961680	966720	recently, in the United States. There have not been recent dam failures resulting in major loss
966720	972080	of life, but there have been warning shots. In 2017, the Oroville Dam had to use its spillway
972080	977600	to reduce water levels during heavy rainfall, but its concrete bays quickly started to break apart.
977600	982080	Operators had to keep sending water through to avoid overtopping the dam, but this and
982080	987280	additional erosion from the emergency spillwater escalated and escalated and started to cut deeply
987280	992320	into the hillside, marching further and further uphill, getting perilously close to eroding the
992320	998240	very foundation of the dam, which likely would have led to collapse. Luckily, reservoir levels
998240	1002560	lowered soon enough that this did not occur, but had the rains kept coming, there's little that
1002640	1007520	could have been done to stop the failure of this dam and the destruction of the heavily populated
1007520	1015760	areas below. Every dam anywhere is like a loaded gun. It impounds a massive quantity of water,
1015760	1020960	and water is perhaps one of the most powerful, dangerous forces on earth. The timescale of these
1020960	1025600	structures means that many people live and die only having known the altered geography a dam
1025600	1030320	creates, and therefore the altered geography starts to feel like the normal geography.
1030320	1035520	People get comfortable. They build beneath the dams, they enjoy the shorelines of the reservoir,
1035520	1041440	and a degree of complacency creeps in as the dam itself starts to feel equally permanent.
1041440	1046800	That complacency is catching up with the world as perhaps best explained by this simple graph.
1046800	1052480	Dam failures are rising, and the practical is matching perfectly with the theoretical.
1052480	1058240	There's no big mystery behind this—most of these failed dams are just plain old.
1058240	1063120	There is some action—it's not like the issue is going entirely ignored—but not nearly enough
1063120	1068080	to match the enormous quantity of dams reaching beyond their intended lifespans and the rising
1068080	1074960	frequency of those riskiest flood scenarios. So catastrophe will probably occur—at this point,
1074960	1080560	it'd be an anomaly of probability for it not to. Then, once it's too late for change and the risk
1080560	1086400	is solidified, complacency might finally wane and people might care about the wall of water
1086400	1092240	sitting upstream, just waiting for one crack, one channel, one inch of overtopping to allow it to
1092240	1098400	come crashing down, returning the river to its natural state, no matter what stands in the way.
1100080	1105120	I used to have a huge issue with data privacy. My job is to make videos that are seen by a good
1105120	1109840	number of people, and inevitably not everyone loves every video, so that's why it was so
1109840	1113440	concerning to me that a ton of my private information had been scraped from public
1113440	1118080	records and data breaches and published on data brokerage sites. This was a real safety
1118080	1122480	risk and as much as I tried to go through and remove these records one by one, there was just
1122480	1128000	always another site. The process was endless. So that's why I was so glad when I found this
1128000	1133680	video's sponsor, Incogny. They handle your data privacy for you. All you do is sign up,
1133680	1137840	give Incogny some of your personal data and grant them the legal right to work on your behalf,
1137840	1141920	then they'll go through and find which sites have your data, then handle removal requests until
1141920	1145520	it's done. Basically, you don't need to worry about whether your data is out there on some
1145520	1149200	sites you don't even know about anymore. This is not only important for security,
1149200	1152560	but these sites are where scammers and telemarketers often find your information,
1152560	1157120	so Incogny can help reduce the frequency of those headaches. Knowing just how bad one
1157120	1162000	security issue can be, I consider the cost of Incogny well worth it, especially since it's
1162000	1167520	not that much and even less when you use code wendover at incogny.com slash wendover to get
1167520	1172960	an exclusive 60% off an annual Incogny plan. You'll be supporting Wendover when you do,
1172960	1177440	so thanks in advance.
