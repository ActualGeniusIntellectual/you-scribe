00:00.000 --> 00:06.400
This is Wixom Lake—home to a humble marina, a waterfront church camp, a lakeside campground,

00:06.400 --> 00:10.560
and a host of small neighborhoods where front yards connect to the road network and backyards

00:10.560 --> 00:17.120
connect to docks. But Wixom Lake isn't actually a lake. Rather, it's a river—the Tintabawassee

00:17.120 --> 00:22.960
River—whose flow happens to be suddenly upended by the Edenville Dam, creating a human-made

00:22.960 --> 00:28.880
reservoir. But whatever you call it—a lake, a river, a reservoir—this nondescript body of

00:28.880 --> 00:35.040
water in a nondescript section of central Michigan has real problems that start and will end with the

00:35.040 --> 00:41.120
dam. Edenville Dam is entirely unexceptional. Until 2020, even the most knowledgeable

00:41.120 --> 00:45.920
michigan d'heure would have a hard time placing it on a map. In fact, perhaps if anyone had heard

00:45.920 --> 00:51.200
of it, it was because of what the dam was no longer allowed to do—generate electricity.

00:51.200 --> 00:58.160
Its claim to fame was its lack of function. In the United States, there are some 91,000 dams.

00:58.160 --> 01:03.120
In Michigan, there are about 2,600. Each and every last one was built with a purpose, or,

01:03.120 --> 01:08.480
to further justify cost, multiple. The Hoover Dam would stop flooding in the Imperial Valley,

01:08.480 --> 01:12.640
as well as provide water storage and power. Grand Coulee would provide electricity and

01:12.640 --> 01:17.360
irrigation water. Glen Canyon, the thinking went, would air condition the southwest.

01:17.360 --> 01:23.360
A far humbler dam in comparison, Edenville has a purpose too. Composed not of concrete but of

01:23.360 --> 01:28.880
earth, a combination of clay, rock, and sand, running over 6,000 feet or 1,800 meters wide but

01:28.880 --> 01:34.480
standing only 52 feet or 18 meters tall at its highest point, it was built to provide electricity

01:34.480 --> 01:39.920
for its surrounding communities. With twin 2.4 megawatt generators, Edenville at its peak output

01:39.920 --> 01:45.440
can only provide around 0.36% of the power of Glen Canyon Dam, but that's still enough power

01:45.440 --> 01:51.440
to feasibly electrify the 34,000 households of Midland County, Michigan. Not bad for a dam built

01:51.440 --> 01:57.200
with private funds some century ago. But that core case for its existence quickly waned when

01:57.200 --> 02:02.480
its owner and operator, Boyce Hydropower LLC, received a federal order to shut down production

02:02.480 --> 02:07.760
in 2018 on account of its inability to meet federal regulations. In the ruling's wake,

02:07.760 --> 02:12.080
a power struggle between dam owners, lakeside property owners, and regulators had seen the

02:12.080 --> 02:16.720
lake's levels rise and fall as the dam let more or less water through, but generally,

02:16.720 --> 02:23.600
they sat below operating levels. Then, beginning on May 14th, 2020, and intensifying on the 18th,

02:23.600 --> 02:29.440
it rained. First, it was manageable—by midnight at the start of the 18th, the water level still

02:29.440 --> 02:34.480
sat below its lower operational limit—in other words, the water still hadn't reached the level

02:34.480 --> 02:40.240
that allowed for power generation, let alone flood levels—but that quickly changed the following

02:40.240 --> 02:44.960
day. As an incredible three inches or eight centimeters of rain fell,

02:44.960 --> 02:50.960
lake levels rose nearly two feet or 60 centimeters in the next 24 hours, then another foot in the

02:50.960 --> 02:57.280
next six hours, then another foot in the next six hours, then, along an unremarkable section

02:57.280 --> 03:03.280
of dam along its eastern edge, it went. Now a river unleashed, the waters overwhelmed the

03:03.280 --> 03:09.040
next dam down, flooding 2,500 structures, racking up nearly $200 million in damages,

03:09.040 --> 03:15.520
and causing 10,000 to evacuate. No one died, but a lake few knew of beforehand now made

03:15.520 --> 03:20.480
national news, and a dam long overlooked suddenly became the center of attention.

03:21.040 --> 03:26.720
As the water receded, the forensic investigation began. The findings were surprising—the dam

03:26.720 --> 03:31.520
hadn't overtopped. The water levels hadn't reached higher than the height of its lip.

03:31.520 --> 03:37.680
It hadn't eroded, either. Rather, it had become unstable—it had fallen victim to a phenomenon

03:37.680 --> 03:42.160
called static liquefaction—essentially, the process of progressive loading of the

03:42.160 --> 03:47.520
soil to the point that it no longer functions as a solid, but rather, a liquid. Dam failure

03:47.520 --> 03:51.680
due to static liquefaction is rare, and as engineers have readily admitted, it's not

03:51.680 --> 03:57.920
well understood nor well documented. In this way, then, the Enville Dam failure was rather singular—

03:57.920 --> 04:02.960
something rarely observed, something that's easier to understand as a freak accident rather

04:02.960 --> 04:08.960
than a systematic failure. But it'd be a mistake to chalk the collapse up to bad luck.

04:08.960 --> 04:14.640
Alternatively, the dam had real flaws of existential proportion that it seemed the

04:14.640 --> 04:19.680
Federal Energy Regulatory Commission revoke its license. Along with compliance issues and

04:19.680 --> 04:24.480
operational procedures, the major issue that federal regulators took with the Enville Dam

04:24.480 --> 04:29.760
was its inability to deal with heavy floodwater—that its spillways, the very structures

04:29.760 --> 04:34.560
present along practically every dam to protect it from flooding, were too small.

04:35.360 --> 04:40.240
While dams may not look it, they're incredibly fragile when water doesn't move through it,

04:40.240 --> 04:46.080
as designed. Capable of holding back millions of acre-feet, just the slightest of spillovers

04:46.080 --> 04:51.760
are disastrous. Even a couple extra inches of water height above a concrete dam will kick off

04:51.760 --> 04:58.000
a calamitous cascade of erosion eating away at the structure's backside and base. On an earthen dam,

04:58.000 --> 05:02.880
like Enville, water will seep into the structure and potentially erode it from the interior.

05:02.880 --> 05:07.760
Should it overtop a dam of any sort, the unexpected pressure and weight is likely to

05:07.760 --> 05:13.200
rip away at the structure. So, to ensure water stays at a low enough level,

05:13.200 --> 05:19.680
dams have spillways. These are essentially extra throughput capacity. While normally water routes

05:19.680 --> 05:24.400
through a dam's gates, spillways provide an extra route in case that's not enough to lower

05:24.400 --> 05:30.000
the reservoir at the same speed that it's rising due to rain. Now, to pass modern federal standards,

05:30.000 --> 05:34.880
Enville's two spillways would need to move enough water to avoid overtopping in the event of a

05:34.880 --> 05:40.160
probable maximum flood—a theoretical flood event calculated by forecasters that would represent the

05:40.160 --> 05:45.360
most severe combination of hydrological and weather conditions likely in the area—conditions

05:45.360 --> 05:50.480
not so dissimilar to the rainstorm that rolled over Michigan in May of 2020.

05:50.480 --> 05:56.320
Enville never actually overtopped, of course, but it may well have if not for its earlier failure.

05:56.320 --> 06:02.000
Water, after all, was rising. And while operators had opened the overmatched spillways, they could

06:02.000 --> 06:07.360
only safely raise the gates up to seven feet as any higher would endanger the structure and its

06:07.360 --> 06:13.680
staff. Perhaps, then, it was less the fault of bad luck, and more so an outcome made inevitable

06:13.680 --> 06:18.480
by the fact that the dam and its operators just couldn't keep up with the upkeep.

06:19.200 --> 06:23.680
Now, at first glance, one might not consider Enville a regulatory failure,

06:23.680 --> 06:27.840
as the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission attempted to get its owners to add spillway

06:27.840 --> 06:32.880
capacity in a way that might have mitigated the eventual collapse, but one must consider that

06:32.880 --> 06:40.000
such a story is far from unique. Across the nation, there are some 7,999 other dams that

06:40.000 --> 06:46.400
are considered deficient, either in design or in maintenance, and then of those, there are 403 that

06:46.400 --> 06:51.760
have the fatal pair. A condition rating of unsatisfactory, indicating that quote,

06:51.760 --> 06:56.720
a dam's safety deficiency is recognized that requires immediate or emergency remedial action

06:56.720 --> 07:02.080
for problem resolution, along with a hazard rating of high, meaning, in the event of failure,

07:02.080 --> 07:09.440
one or more fatalities is not only possible, but probable. Each of these 403 is in a situation like

07:09.440 --> 07:15.120
Lake Hodges Dam in San Diego, California. Here, the more than century-old structure is quite

07:15.120 --> 07:19.920
literally cracking and crumbling, while also threatened by a known lack of adequate spillway

07:19.920 --> 07:25.120
capacity for the maximum probable flood scenario. If the structure were to fail, it'd take less than

07:25.120 --> 07:30.800
two hours for this entire swath of land to get inundated with water as much as 23 feet or 7

07:30.800 --> 07:35.840
meters deep, leaving dangerously little evacuation time for the thousands of individuals living on

07:35.840 --> 07:41.280
both banks of the San Diogito River, informing the regulator's belief of the inevitability of

07:41.360 --> 07:47.520
fatality. Looking past the regulatory failures and design deficiencies and exceptional weather,

07:47.520 --> 07:53.520
what fundamentally makes these 403 dams so dangerous is the fact that they're just, simply,

07:53.520 --> 08:00.160
old. Age issues are always tricky as they only ever escalate, but, inconceivably, this isn't like

08:00.160 --> 08:06.400
any other age issue—it's worse. That's because, right now, there is a massive, disproportionate

08:06.400 --> 08:10.400
surge of dams getting to the age where age itself is an issue.

08:10.400 --> 08:16.560
The impetus of this surge was a dam-building boom that occurred some 50 or 70 years ago.

08:16.560 --> 08:23.120
Between 1960 and 1980 alone, some 31,000 of the structures were constructed in the United States,

08:23.120 --> 08:28.800
representing more than a third of those standing today. And this was hardly confined to the US.

08:28.800 --> 08:33.520
Around the world, dams were perceived as the perfect solution to provide copious quantities

08:33.520 --> 08:39.600
of cheap, reliable, geopolitically safe energy. The World Bank, in its role financing development-

08:39.600 --> 08:44.400
oriented infrastructure projects in low- and medium-income countries, was a major force in

08:44.400 --> 08:49.840
enabling the development of not just dams, but large dams around the world—the kind that would

08:49.840 --> 08:54.960
reshape entire regions. The thought was that a country would benefit from the employment created

08:54.960 --> 08:59.920
by the construction of such structures, then, once complete, they'd have so much cheap electricity

08:59.920 --> 09:04.480
that an industrial sector would pop up that would provide further employment. Meanwhile,

09:04.480 --> 09:08.880
dams could also help stabilize a water supply, mitigate floods, and help with agricultural

09:08.880 --> 09:14.320
irrigation, so with copious theoretical benefits, hundreds of millions of dollars flowed from World

09:14.320 --> 09:19.920
Bank coffers and they became the number one financier of large dams worldwide.

09:19.920 --> 09:25.600
But each time a dam is built, a geography is altered significantly. For example,

09:25.600 --> 09:30.320
when the Kariba Dam's gates were closed for the first time and the flow of the Zambezi restricted,

09:30.320 --> 09:36.000
that started the formation of what's now known as Lake Kariba. These reservoirs are a fundamental

09:36.000 --> 09:40.800
component of dams—they provide the pressure to turn a turbine for power, and they're the natural

09:40.800 --> 09:47.040
byproduct of stabilizing downstream flow—but they're also massive. Lake Kariba, in fact,

09:47.040 --> 09:53.360
is over twice the size of the nation of Luxembourg. Or put another way, the Kariba Dam removed more

09:53.360 --> 10:00.720
than two Luxembourgs worth of land from Zimbabwe and Zambia. 58,000 people lived on that riverside,

10:00.720 --> 10:06.480
but, as water levels rose, they had to leave the only homes they'd ever known to decamp to less

10:06.480 --> 10:11.920
familiar, less fertile land. Little to no compensation was given to these individuals,

10:11.920 --> 10:17.440
and it took 50 years for any sort of meaningful community rehabilitation efforts to start.

10:18.000 --> 10:23.440
This story was replicated essentially anywhere the World Bank developed a dam. In Guatemala,

10:23.440 --> 10:30.240
the Chixoy Dam deplaced 3,500, and 444 were murdered by the government for resisting their

10:30.240 --> 10:34.800
forced displacement. On the border between Argentina and Paraguay, the Yacreta Dam

10:34.800 --> 10:40.160
displaced upwards of 20,000, again without any meaningful compensation. And problems

10:40.160 --> 10:45.840
persist beyond just displacement—the Yacreta Dam propagated malaria and dengue fever by enlarging

10:45.840 --> 10:50.640
the mosquito habitat, and simultaneously led to the extinction of two species of snail

10:50.640 --> 10:56.480
due to habitat destruction. This is all to say, dams are not some simple device that

10:56.480 --> 11:03.840
effortlessly translates water into electricity—they have a colossal impact. On average, this impact is

11:03.840 --> 11:09.600
felt by poor rural communities, so governments and developers have long found their cries easy

11:09.600 --> 11:15.440
to ignore. But through the years, as the cases counted up, public pressure was mounting on the

11:15.440 --> 11:22.080
World Bank. In 1994, 2,000 NGOs signed the Manabelli Declaration calling for a full-scale

11:22.080 --> 11:28.480
moratorium on dam financing, citing the staggering statistic that 10 million people had been

11:28.480 --> 11:33.920
displaced from their homes by their actions. So, in response to this and other public pushback,

11:33.920 --> 11:38.480
the World Bank partnered with the International Union for Conservation of Nature to form the

11:38.480 --> 11:43.760
World Commission on Dams, a multidisciplinary panel of experts that would study past projects

11:43.760 --> 11:50.080
in order to develop a framework for future ones and answer, once and for all, how to build a good

11:50.080 --> 11:57.680
dam. The answer was perhaps not what the World Bank expected. What the report said, across 404

11:57.680 --> 12:03.680
pages, was that, in sum, historically, the benefits of dams had been overstated and the

12:03.680 --> 12:10.240
costs had been understated. That's to say, dams simply were not as good as previously thought.

12:10.800 --> 12:15.280
While this answer had been coming into focus for decades, this was the most definitive,

12:15.280 --> 12:20.800
official instance of it to date, and in response, both the World Bank and the world more broadly

12:20.800 --> 12:26.240
slowed down its dam development. This coincided with a naturally waning financial case for

12:26.240 --> 12:31.360
hydropower. It's far from the cheapest source of electricity in the US—multiple fossil fuel

12:31.360 --> 12:36.320
sources are cheaper, and even solar and wind now beat its prices. And it's not like its higher

12:36.320 --> 12:41.120
price can be strongly justified on environmental grounds—even ignoring habitat and home

12:41.120 --> 12:46.320
destruction, the creation of a reservoir leads to the death of all the plants it drowns out, which,

12:46.320 --> 12:52.080
in many cases, leads to as much or more greenhouse gas emissions in the first decade of operations

12:52.080 --> 12:56.480
as a coal-fired power plant producing the equivalent amount of electricity.

12:56.480 --> 13:03.360
So, in all, that era of rapid dam development is now bookended, leaving a huge quantity of

13:03.360 --> 13:10.720
aging dams that, perhaps most dangerously, are increasingly unprofitable. You see, the confluence

13:10.720 --> 13:16.320
between financial well-being and physical peril stems from the fact that 65% of dams in the US

13:16.320 --> 13:22.000
are owned not by governments, but by private entities. The failed Edenville Dam was one such

13:22.000 --> 13:26.800
example—after being passed around between companies for decades, in 2006 it ended up in

13:26.800 --> 13:32.720
the hands of Boyce Hydropower LLC. Boyce was a small company whose operations were limited to

13:32.720 --> 13:38.320
the ownership of a few area dams, and that was as intended—they operated more as an investment

13:38.320 --> 13:43.920
vehicle, in fact, than a company. That's because it was owned by the trust of William Dixon Boyce,

13:43.920 --> 13:48.880
the founder of the Boy Scouts of America, meaning, after his death, his wealth was put into this

13:48.880 --> 13:53.520
legal entity designed to manage it according to his wishes, and therefore the trust's managers

13:53.520 --> 13:59.600
made investments to maintain and grow the wealth, including, in this case, buying dams in Michigan.

13:59.600 --> 14:03.120
Theoretically, dams could be a good investment since they're assets with

14:03.120 --> 14:07.920
relatively low operational costs that provide stable, ongoing income through electricity

14:07.920 --> 14:12.640
production. In this case, however, Edenville was bought at a particularly low price since

14:12.640 --> 14:18.320
it was known from the start that it'd need some imminent and expensive upgrades. Nearly a century

14:18.320 --> 14:23.760
on from its construction, the structure no longer conformed to federal spillway capacity guidelines.

14:23.760 --> 14:28.080
After conducting hundreds of thousands of dollars of design work, Boyce finally determined that it

14:28.160 --> 14:33.520
would cost some $8 million to conform to federal standards, which the company said they simply

14:33.520 --> 14:39.360
could not afford. Therefore, they just didn't make the upgrades, and their operator's license

14:39.360 --> 14:44.320
was revoked. The wide-scale private ownership of these pieces of public infrastructure

14:44.320 --> 14:49.600
makes this situation far too feasible. Companies have assets that are becoming less and less

14:49.600 --> 14:54.240
valuable as their economic case wanes, and therefore willingness to maintain or upgrade

14:54.240 --> 15:00.320
them is low. So, there's an overwhelming surge of dams getting dangerously old with increasingly

15:00.320 --> 15:05.840
disinterested owners, meaning dams are becoming less equipped to deal with the worst-case flood

15:05.840 --> 15:11.760
scenarios. But the ultimate crux of the dam issue stems from the fact that global temperatures are

15:11.760 --> 15:17.120
rising. Warmer air holds more water vapor, meaning it creates stronger storms with more

15:17.120 --> 15:22.560
precipitation. The sixth IPCC report determined that the worst storms of a given decade in a

15:22.560 --> 15:28.240
given place are already 6.7% wetter, and if global temperatures rise by 2 degrees Celsius,

15:28.240 --> 15:32.960
as now seems all but inevitable, this intensity increase will be as much as 14%.

15:33.760 --> 15:38.800
And the intensity increase is even greater for the worst storms of a 50-year span, meaning,

15:38.800 --> 15:44.400
not only are bad storms getting wetter, but the maximum potential of the absolute worst storms

15:44.400 --> 15:50.480
is intensifying even faster. Dams were designed to handle the worst-case scenario from decades,

15:50.480 --> 15:56.320
even over a century ago, but now that worst-case scenario is rapidly and meaningfully escalated,

15:56.320 --> 16:01.680
and the dams are getting worse. The worst-case scenario has not happened

16:01.680 --> 16:06.720
recently, in the United States. There have not been recent dam failures resulting in major loss

16:06.720 --> 16:12.080
of life, but there have been warning shots. In 2017, the Oroville Dam had to use its spillway

16:12.080 --> 16:17.600
to reduce water levels during heavy rainfall, but its concrete bays quickly started to break apart.

16:17.600 --> 16:22.080
Operators had to keep sending water through to avoid overtopping the dam, but this and

16:22.080 --> 16:27.280
additional erosion from the emergency spillwater escalated and escalated and started to cut deeply

16:27.280 --> 16:32.320
into the hillside, marching further and further uphill, getting perilously close to eroding the

16:32.320 --> 16:38.240
very foundation of the dam, which likely would have led to collapse. Luckily, reservoir levels

16:38.240 --> 16:42.560
lowered soon enough that this did not occur, but had the rains kept coming, there's little that

16:42.640 --> 16:47.520
could have been done to stop the failure of this dam and the destruction of the heavily populated

16:47.520 --> 16:55.760
areas below. Every dam anywhere is like a loaded gun. It impounds a massive quantity of water,

16:55.760 --> 17:00.960
and water is perhaps one of the most powerful, dangerous forces on earth. The timescale of these

17:00.960 --> 17:05.600
structures means that many people live and die only having known the altered geography a dam

17:05.600 --> 17:10.320
creates, and therefore the altered geography starts to feel like the normal geography.

17:10.320 --> 17:15.520
People get comfortable. They build beneath the dams, they enjoy the shorelines of the reservoir,

17:15.520 --> 17:21.440
and a degree of complacency creeps in as the dam itself starts to feel equally permanent.

17:21.440 --> 17:26.800
That complacency is catching up with the world as perhaps best explained by this simple graph.

17:26.800 --> 17:32.480
Dam failures are rising, and the practical is matching perfectly with the theoretical.

17:32.480 --> 17:38.240
There's no big mystery behind this—most of these failed dams are just plain old.

17:38.240 --> 17:43.120
There is some action—it's not like the issue is going entirely ignored—but not nearly enough

17:43.120 --> 17:48.080
to match the enormous quantity of dams reaching beyond their intended lifespans and the rising

17:48.080 --> 17:54.960
frequency of those riskiest flood scenarios. So catastrophe will probably occur—at this point,

17:54.960 --> 18:00.560
it'd be an anomaly of probability for it not to. Then, once it's too late for change and the risk

18:00.560 --> 18:06.400
is solidified, complacency might finally wane and people might care about the wall of water

18:06.400 --> 18:12.240
sitting upstream, just waiting for one crack, one channel, one inch of overtopping to allow it to

18:12.240 --> 18:18.400
come crashing down, returning the river to its natural state, no matter what stands in the way.

18:20.080 --> 18:25.120
I used to have a huge issue with data privacy. My job is to make videos that are seen by a good

18:25.120 --> 18:29.840
number of people, and inevitably not everyone loves every video, so that's why it was so

18:29.840 --> 18:33.440
concerning to me that a ton of my private information had been scraped from public

18:33.440 --> 18:38.080
records and data breaches and published on data brokerage sites. This was a real safety

18:38.080 --> 18:42.480
risk and as much as I tried to go through and remove these records one by one, there was just

18:42.480 --> 18:48.000
always another site. The process was endless. So that's why I was so glad when I found this

18:48.000 --> 18:53.680
video's sponsor, Incogny. They handle your data privacy for you. All you do is sign up,

18:53.680 --> 18:57.840
give Incogny some of your personal data and grant them the legal right to work on your behalf,

18:57.840 --> 19:01.920
then they'll go through and find which sites have your data, then handle removal requests until

19:01.920 --> 19:05.520
it's done. Basically, you don't need to worry about whether your data is out there on some

19:05.520 --> 19:09.200
sites you don't even know about anymore. This is not only important for security,

19:09.200 --> 19:12.560
but these sites are where scammers and telemarketers often find your information,

19:12.560 --> 19:17.120
so Incogny can help reduce the frequency of those headaches. Knowing just how bad one

19:17.120 --> 19:22.000
security issue can be, I consider the cost of Incogny well worth it, especially since it's

19:22.000 --> 19:27.520
not that much and even less when you use code wendover at incogny.com slash wendover to get

19:27.520 --> 19:32.960
an exclusive 60% off an annual Incogny plan. You'll be supporting Wendover when you do,

19:32.960 --> 19:37.440
so thanks in advance.
