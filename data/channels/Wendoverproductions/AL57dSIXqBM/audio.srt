1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,400
This is Wixom Lake—home to a humble marina, a waterfront church camp, a lakeside campground,

2
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:10,560
and a host of small neighborhoods where front yards connect to the road network and backyards

3
00:00:10,560 --> 00:00:17,120
connect to docks. But Wixom Lake isn't actually a lake. Rather, it's a river—the Tintabawassee

4
00:00:17,120 --> 00:00:22,960
River—whose flow happens to be suddenly upended by the Edenville Dam, creating a human-made

5
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:28,880
reservoir. But whatever you call it—a lake, a river, a reservoir—this nondescript body of

6
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:35,040
water in a nondescript section of central Michigan has real problems that start and will end with the

7
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:41,120
dam. Edenville Dam is entirely unexceptional. Until 2020, even the most knowledgeable

8
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:45,920
michigan d'heure would have a hard time placing it on a map. In fact, perhaps if anyone had heard

9
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:51,200
of it, it was because of what the dam was no longer allowed to do—generate electricity.

10
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:58,160
Its claim to fame was its lack of function. In the United States, there are some 91,000 dams.

11
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:03,120
In Michigan, there are about 2,600. Each and every last one was built with a purpose, or,

12
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:08,480
to further justify cost, multiple. The Hoover Dam would stop flooding in the Imperial Valley,

13
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:12,640
as well as provide water storage and power. Grand Coulee would provide electricity and

14
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:17,360
irrigation water. Glen Canyon, the thinking went, would air condition the southwest.

15
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:23,360
A far humbler dam in comparison, Edenville has a purpose too. Composed not of concrete but of

16
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:28,880
earth, a combination of clay, rock, and sand, running over 6,000 feet or 1,800 meters wide but

17
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:34,480
standing only 52 feet or 18 meters tall at its highest point, it was built to provide electricity

18
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:39,920
for its surrounding communities. With twin 2.4 megawatt generators, Edenville at its peak output

19
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:45,440
can only provide around 0.36% of the power of Glen Canyon Dam, but that's still enough power

20
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:51,440
to feasibly electrify the 34,000 households of Midland County, Michigan. Not bad for a dam built

21
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:57,200
with private funds some century ago. But that core case for its existence quickly waned when

22
00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:02,480
its owner and operator, Boyce Hydropower LLC, received a federal order to shut down production

23
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:07,760
in 2018 on account of its inability to meet federal regulations. In the ruling's wake,

24
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:12,080
a power struggle between dam owners, lakeside property owners, and regulators had seen the

25
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:16,720
lake's levels rise and fall as the dam let more or less water through, but generally,

26
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:23,600
they sat below operating levels. Then, beginning on May 14th, 2020, and intensifying on the 18th,

27
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:29,440
it rained. First, it was manageable—by midnight at the start of the 18th, the water level still

28
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:34,480
sat below its lower operational limit—in other words, the water still hadn't reached the level

29
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:40,240
that allowed for power generation, let alone flood levels—but that quickly changed the following

30
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:44,960
day. As an incredible three inches or eight centimeters of rain fell,

31
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:50,960
lake levels rose nearly two feet or 60 centimeters in the next 24 hours, then another foot in the

32
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:57,280
next six hours, then another foot in the next six hours, then, along an unremarkable section

33
00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:03,280
of dam along its eastern edge, it went. Now a river unleashed, the waters overwhelmed the

34
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:09,040
next dam down, flooding 2,500 structures, racking up nearly $200 million in damages,

35
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:15,520
and causing 10,000 to evacuate. No one died, but a lake few knew of beforehand now made

36
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:20,480
national news, and a dam long overlooked suddenly became the center of attention.

37
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:26,720
As the water receded, the forensic investigation began. The findings were surprising—the dam

38
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:31,520
hadn't overtopped. The water levels hadn't reached higher than the height of its lip.

39
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:37,680
It hadn't eroded, either. Rather, it had become unstable—it had fallen victim to a phenomenon

40
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:42,160
called static liquefaction—essentially, the process of progressive loading of the

41
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:47,520
soil to the point that it no longer functions as a solid, but rather, a liquid. Dam failure

42
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:51,680
due to static liquefaction is rare, and as engineers have readily admitted, it's not

43
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:57,920
well understood nor well documented. In this way, then, the Enville Dam failure was rather singular—

44
00:03:57,920 --> 00:04:02,960
something rarely observed, something that's easier to understand as a freak accident rather

45
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:08,960
than a systematic failure. But it'd be a mistake to chalk the collapse up to bad luck.

46
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:14,640
Alternatively, the dam had real flaws of existential proportion that it seemed the

47
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:19,680
Federal Energy Regulatory Commission revoke its license. Along with compliance issues and

48
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:24,480
operational procedures, the major issue that federal regulators took with the Enville Dam

49
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:29,760
was its inability to deal with heavy floodwater—that its spillways, the very structures

50
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:34,560
present along practically every dam to protect it from flooding, were too small.

51
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:40,240
While dams may not look it, they're incredibly fragile when water doesn't move through it,

52
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:46,080
as designed. Capable of holding back millions of acre-feet, just the slightest of spillovers

53
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:51,760
are disastrous. Even a couple extra inches of water height above a concrete dam will kick off

54
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:58,000
a calamitous cascade of erosion eating away at the structure's backside and base. On an earthen dam,

55
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:02,880
like Enville, water will seep into the structure and potentially erode it from the interior.

56
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:07,760
Should it overtop a dam of any sort, the unexpected pressure and weight is likely to

57
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:13,200
rip away at the structure. So, to ensure water stays at a low enough level,

58
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:19,680
dams have spillways. These are essentially extra throughput capacity. While normally water routes

59
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:24,400
through a dam's gates, spillways provide an extra route in case that's not enough to lower

60
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:30,000
the reservoir at the same speed that it's rising due to rain. Now, to pass modern federal standards,

61
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:34,880
Enville's two spillways would need to move enough water to avoid overtopping in the event of a

62
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:40,160
probable maximum flood—a theoretical flood event calculated by forecasters that would represent the

63
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:45,360
most severe combination of hydrological and weather conditions likely in the area—conditions

64
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:50,480
not so dissimilar to the rainstorm that rolled over Michigan in May of 2020.

65
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:56,320
Enville never actually overtopped, of course, but it may well have if not for its earlier failure.

66
00:05:56,320 --> 00:06:02,000
Water, after all, was rising. And while operators had opened the overmatched spillways, they could

67
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:07,360
only safely raise the gates up to seven feet as any higher would endanger the structure and its

68
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:13,680
staff. Perhaps, then, it was less the fault of bad luck, and more so an outcome made inevitable

69
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:18,480
by the fact that the dam and its operators just couldn't keep up with the upkeep.

70
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:23,680
Now, at first glance, one might not consider Enville a regulatory failure,

71
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:27,840
as the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission attempted to get its owners to add spillway

72
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:32,880
capacity in a way that might have mitigated the eventual collapse, but one must consider that

73
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:40,000
such a story is far from unique. Across the nation, there are some 7,999 other dams that

74
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:46,400
are considered deficient, either in design or in maintenance, and then of those, there are 403 that

75
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:51,760
have the fatal pair. A condition rating of unsatisfactory, indicating that quote,

76
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:56,720
a dam's safety deficiency is recognized that requires immediate or emergency remedial action

77
00:06:56,720 --> 00:07:02,080
for problem resolution, along with a hazard rating of high, meaning, in the event of failure,

78
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:09,440
one or more fatalities is not only possible, but probable. Each of these 403 is in a situation like

79
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:15,120
Lake Hodges Dam in San Diego, California. Here, the more than century-old structure is quite

80
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:19,920
literally cracking and crumbling, while also threatened by a known lack of adequate spillway

81
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:25,120
capacity for the maximum probable flood scenario. If the structure were to fail, it'd take less than

82
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:30,800
two hours for this entire swath of land to get inundated with water as much as 23 feet or 7

83
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:35,840
meters deep, leaving dangerously little evacuation time for the thousands of individuals living on

84
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:41,280
both banks of the San Diogito River, informing the regulator's belief of the inevitability of

85
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:47,520
fatality. Looking past the regulatory failures and design deficiencies and exceptional weather,

86
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:53,520
what fundamentally makes these 403 dams so dangerous is the fact that they're just, simply,

87
00:07:53,520 --> 00:08:00,160
old. Age issues are always tricky as they only ever escalate, but, inconceivably, this isn't like

88
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:06,400
any other age issue—it's worse. That's because, right now, there is a massive, disproportionate

89
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:10,400
surge of dams getting to the age where age itself is an issue.

90
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:16,560
The impetus of this surge was a dam-building boom that occurred some 50 or 70 years ago.

91
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:23,120
Between 1960 and 1980 alone, some 31,000 of the structures were constructed in the United States,

92
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:28,800
representing more than a third of those standing today. And this was hardly confined to the US.

93
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:33,520
Around the world, dams were perceived as the perfect solution to provide copious quantities

94
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:39,600
of cheap, reliable, geopolitically safe energy. The World Bank, in its role financing development-

95
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:44,400
oriented infrastructure projects in low- and medium-income countries, was a major force in

96
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:49,840
enabling the development of not just dams, but large dams around the world—the kind that would

97
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:54,960
reshape entire regions. The thought was that a country would benefit from the employment created

98
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:59,920
by the construction of such structures, then, once complete, they'd have so much cheap electricity

99
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:04,480
that an industrial sector would pop up that would provide further employment. Meanwhile,

100
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:08,880
dams could also help stabilize a water supply, mitigate floods, and help with agricultural

101
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:14,320
irrigation, so with copious theoretical benefits, hundreds of millions of dollars flowed from World

102
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:19,920
Bank coffers and they became the number one financier of large dams worldwide.

103
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:25,600
But each time a dam is built, a geography is altered significantly. For example,

104
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:30,320
when the Kariba Dam's gates were closed for the first time and the flow of the Zambezi restricted,

105
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:36,000
that started the formation of what's now known as Lake Kariba. These reservoirs are a fundamental

106
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:40,800
component of dams—they provide the pressure to turn a turbine for power, and they're the natural

107
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:47,040
byproduct of stabilizing downstream flow—but they're also massive. Lake Kariba, in fact,

108
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:53,360
is over twice the size of the nation of Luxembourg. Or put another way, the Kariba Dam removed more

109
00:09:53,360 --> 00:10:00,720
than two Luxembourgs worth of land from Zimbabwe and Zambia. 58,000 people lived on that riverside,

110
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:06,480
but, as water levels rose, they had to leave the only homes they'd ever known to decamp to less

111
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:11,920
familiar, less fertile land. Little to no compensation was given to these individuals,

112
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:17,440
and it took 50 years for any sort of meaningful community rehabilitation efforts to start.

113
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:23,440
This story was replicated essentially anywhere the World Bank developed a dam. In Guatemala,

114
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:30,240
the Chixoy Dam deplaced 3,500, and 444 were murdered by the government for resisting their

115
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:34,800
forced displacement. On the border between Argentina and Paraguay, the Yacreta Dam

116
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:40,160
displaced upwards of 20,000, again without any meaningful compensation. And problems

117
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:45,840
persist beyond just displacement—the Yacreta Dam propagated malaria and dengue fever by enlarging

118
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:50,640
the mosquito habitat, and simultaneously led to the extinction of two species of snail

119
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:56,480
due to habitat destruction. This is all to say, dams are not some simple device that

120
00:10:56,480 --> 00:11:03,840
effortlessly translates water into electricity—they have a colossal impact. On average, this impact is

121
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:09,600
felt by poor rural communities, so governments and developers have long found their cries easy

122
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:15,440
to ignore. But through the years, as the cases counted up, public pressure was mounting on the

123
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:22,080
World Bank. In 1994, 2,000 NGOs signed the Manabelli Declaration calling for a full-scale

124
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:28,480
moratorium on dam financing, citing the staggering statistic that 10 million people had been

125
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:33,920
displaced from their homes by their actions. So, in response to this and other public pushback,

126
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:38,480
the World Bank partnered with the International Union for Conservation of Nature to form the

127
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:43,760
World Commission on Dams, a multidisciplinary panel of experts that would study past projects

128
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:50,080
in order to develop a framework for future ones and answer, once and for all, how to build a good

129
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:57,680
dam. The answer was perhaps not what the World Bank expected. What the report said, across 404

130
00:11:57,680 --> 00:12:03,680
pages, was that, in sum, historically, the benefits of dams had been overstated and the

131
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:10,240
costs had been understated. That's to say, dams simply were not as good as previously thought.

132
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:15,280
While this answer had been coming into focus for decades, this was the most definitive,

133
00:12:15,280 --> 00:12:20,800
official instance of it to date, and in response, both the World Bank and the world more broadly

134
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:26,240
slowed down its dam development. This coincided with a naturally waning financial case for

135
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:31,360
hydropower. It's far from the cheapest source of electricity in the US—multiple fossil fuel

136
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:36,320
sources are cheaper, and even solar and wind now beat its prices. And it's not like its higher

137
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:41,120
price can be strongly justified on environmental grounds—even ignoring habitat and home

138
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:46,320
destruction, the creation of a reservoir leads to the death of all the plants it drowns out, which,

139
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:52,080
in many cases, leads to as much or more greenhouse gas emissions in the first decade of operations

140
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:56,480
as a coal-fired power plant producing the equivalent amount of electricity.

141
00:12:56,480 --> 00:13:03,360
So, in all, that era of rapid dam development is now bookended, leaving a huge quantity of

142
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:10,720
aging dams that, perhaps most dangerously, are increasingly unprofitable. You see, the confluence

143
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:16,320
between financial well-being and physical peril stems from the fact that 65% of dams in the US

144
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:22,000
are owned not by governments, but by private entities. The failed Edenville Dam was one such

145
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:26,800
example—after being passed around between companies for decades, in 2006 it ended up in

146
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:32,720
the hands of Boyce Hydropower LLC. Boyce was a small company whose operations were limited to

147
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:38,320
the ownership of a few area dams, and that was as intended—they operated more as an investment

148
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:43,920
vehicle, in fact, than a company. That's because it was owned by the trust of William Dixon Boyce,

149
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:48,880
the founder of the Boy Scouts of America, meaning, after his death, his wealth was put into this

150
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:53,520
legal entity designed to manage it according to his wishes, and therefore the trust's managers

151
00:13:53,520 --> 00:13:59,600
made investments to maintain and grow the wealth, including, in this case, buying dams in Michigan.

152
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:03,120
Theoretically, dams could be a good investment since they're assets with

153
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:07,920
relatively low operational costs that provide stable, ongoing income through electricity

154
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:12,640
production. In this case, however, Edenville was bought at a particularly low price since

155
00:14:12,640 --> 00:14:18,320
it was known from the start that it'd need some imminent and expensive upgrades. Nearly a century

156
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:23,760
on from its construction, the structure no longer conformed to federal spillway capacity guidelines.

157
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:28,080
After conducting hundreds of thousands of dollars of design work, Boyce finally determined that it

158
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:33,520
would cost some $8 million to conform to federal standards, which the company said they simply

159
00:14:33,520 --> 00:14:39,360
could not afford. Therefore, they just didn't make the upgrades, and their operator's license

160
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:44,320
was revoked. The wide-scale private ownership of these pieces of public infrastructure

161
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:49,600
makes this situation far too feasible. Companies have assets that are becoming less and less

162
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:54,240
valuable as their economic case wanes, and therefore willingness to maintain or upgrade

163
00:14:54,240 --> 00:15:00,320
them is low. So, there's an overwhelming surge of dams getting dangerously old with increasingly

164
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:05,840
disinterested owners, meaning dams are becoming less equipped to deal with the worst-case flood

165
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:11,760
scenarios. But the ultimate crux of the dam issue stems from the fact that global temperatures are

166
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:17,120
rising. Warmer air holds more water vapor, meaning it creates stronger storms with more

167
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:22,560
precipitation. The sixth IPCC report determined that the worst storms of a given decade in a

168
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:28,240
given place are already 6.7% wetter, and if global temperatures rise by 2 degrees Celsius,

169
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:32,960
as now seems all but inevitable, this intensity increase will be as much as 14%.

170
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:38,800
And the intensity increase is even greater for the worst storms of a 50-year span, meaning,

171
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:44,400
not only are bad storms getting wetter, but the maximum potential of the absolute worst storms

172
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:50,480
is intensifying even faster. Dams were designed to handle the worst-case scenario from decades,

173
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:56,320
even over a century ago, but now that worst-case scenario is rapidly and meaningfully escalated,

174
00:15:56,320 --> 00:16:01,680
and the dams are getting worse. The worst-case scenario has not happened

175
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:06,720
recently, in the United States. There have not been recent dam failures resulting in major loss

176
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:12,080
of life, but there have been warning shots. In 2017, the Oroville Dam had to use its spillway

177
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:17,600
to reduce water levels during heavy rainfall, but its concrete bays quickly started to break apart.

178
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:22,080
Operators had to keep sending water through to avoid overtopping the dam, but this and

179
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:27,280
additional erosion from the emergency spillwater escalated and escalated and started to cut deeply

180
00:16:27,280 --> 00:16:32,320
into the hillside, marching further and further uphill, getting perilously close to eroding the

181
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:38,240
very foundation of the dam, which likely would have led to collapse. Luckily, reservoir levels

182
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:42,560
lowered soon enough that this did not occur, but had the rains kept coming, there's little that

183
00:16:42,640 --> 00:16:47,520
could have been done to stop the failure of this dam and the destruction of the heavily populated

184
00:16:47,520 --> 00:16:55,760
areas below. Every dam anywhere is like a loaded gun. It impounds a massive quantity of water,

185
00:16:55,760 --> 00:17:00,960
and water is perhaps one of the most powerful, dangerous forces on earth. The timescale of these

186
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:05,600
structures means that many people live and die only having known the altered geography a dam

187
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:10,320
creates, and therefore the altered geography starts to feel like the normal geography.

188
00:17:10,320 --> 00:17:15,520
People get comfortable. They build beneath the dams, they enjoy the shorelines of the reservoir,

189
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:21,440
and a degree of complacency creeps in as the dam itself starts to feel equally permanent.

190
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:26,800
That complacency is catching up with the world as perhaps best explained by this simple graph.

191
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:32,480
Dam failures are rising, and the practical is matching perfectly with the theoretical.

192
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:38,240
There's no big mystery behind this—most of these failed dams are just plain old.

193
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:43,120
There is some action—it's not like the issue is going entirely ignored—but not nearly enough

194
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:48,080
to match the enormous quantity of dams reaching beyond their intended lifespans and the rising

195
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:54,960
frequency of those riskiest flood scenarios. So catastrophe will probably occur—at this point,

196
00:17:54,960 --> 00:18:00,560
it'd be an anomaly of probability for it not to. Then, once it's too late for change and the risk

197
00:18:00,560 --> 00:18:06,400
is solidified, complacency might finally wane and people might care about the wall of water

198
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:12,240
sitting upstream, just waiting for one crack, one channel, one inch of overtopping to allow it to

199
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:18,400
come crashing down, returning the river to its natural state, no matter what stands in the way.

200
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:25,120
I used to have a huge issue with data privacy. My job is to make videos that are seen by a good

201
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:29,840
number of people, and inevitably not everyone loves every video, so that's why it was so

202
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:33,440
concerning to me that a ton of my private information had been scraped from public

203
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:38,080
records and data breaches and published on data brokerage sites. This was a real safety

204
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:42,480
risk and as much as I tried to go through and remove these records one by one, there was just

205
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:48,000
always another site. The process was endless. So that's why I was so glad when I found this

206
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:53,680
video's sponsor, Incogny. They handle your data privacy for you. All you do is sign up,

207
00:18:53,680 --> 00:18:57,840
give Incogny some of your personal data and grant them the legal right to work on your behalf,

208
00:18:57,840 --> 00:19:01,920
then they'll go through and find which sites have your data, then handle removal requests until

209
00:19:01,920 --> 00:19:05,520
it's done. Basically, you don't need to worry about whether your data is out there on some

210
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:09,200
sites you don't even know about anymore. This is not only important for security,

211
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:12,560
but these sites are where scammers and telemarketers often find your information,

212
00:19:12,560 --> 00:19:17,120
so Incogny can help reduce the frequency of those headaches. Knowing just how bad one

213
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:22,000
security issue can be, I consider the cost of Incogny well worth it, especially since it's

214
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:27,520
not that much and even less when you use code wendover at incogny.com slash wendover to get

215
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:32,960
an exclusive 60% off an annual Incogny plan. You'll be supporting Wendover when you do,

216
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:37,440
so thanks in advance.
