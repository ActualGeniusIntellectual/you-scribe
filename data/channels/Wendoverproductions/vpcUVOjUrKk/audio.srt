4
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:13,440
There are few sports as expensive as skiing.

5
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:19,060
A daily lift ticket alone typically costs more than $100 with top resorts such as Vail

6
00:00:19,060 --> 00:00:22,640
charging up to $209 for a day's skiing.

7
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:25,560
It'd be easy to call this a rip-off.

8
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:31,100
After all, all those $209 are getting you is access, along with thousands of other people,

9
00:00:31,100 --> 00:00:36,180
to one of 32 lifts between the hours of 8.30am and 3.30pm.

10
00:00:36,180 --> 00:00:39,600
Does it really cost that much for a resort to run a few lifts?

11
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:42,900
Well, the short answer is sort of.

12
00:00:42,900 --> 00:00:45,520
Ski lifts are a simple enough concept.

13
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:49,820
With the most common design, chairs, each with a capacity between 1 and 8, are connected

14
00:00:49,820 --> 00:00:54,880
to a continuously rotating cable pulled by motors at the top or bottom of the lift.

15
00:00:54,880 --> 00:01:00,240
Given all the redundancies and safety systems, though, they end up being fairly complex machines,

16
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:02,240
and complex means expensive.

17
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:07,520
While it varies widely depending on length, capacity, specifications, and location, costs

18
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:13,540
for the construction of a new lift alone regularly reach $10 million and most large ski resorts

19
00:01:13,540 --> 00:01:15,620
have dozens of lifts.

20
00:01:15,620 --> 00:01:18,800
In Vail's case, once again, they have 32.

21
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:22,760
That means that, even if they were all the kinds of lifts that cost $10 million, which

22
00:01:22,760 --> 00:01:27,520
are not, that would total to $320 million.

23
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:32,740
Those $320 million are divided by a lift lifespan of a few dozen years, then divided further

24
00:01:32,740 --> 00:01:36,760
by the hundreds of thousands of yearly visitors who are each paying up to hundreds of dollars

25
00:01:36,760 --> 00:01:41,660
per day, and you can start to see, pretty quickly, that it is not because of building

26
00:01:41,660 --> 00:01:44,220
lifts that skiing is expensive.

27
00:01:44,220 --> 00:01:48,380
The paradox of ski resorts is that buying and installing ski lifts, which are their

28
00:01:48,380 --> 00:01:54,340
primary physical assets, only represents a small proportion of their costs.

29
00:01:54,340 --> 00:01:59,180
Actually running ski lifts is trickier, but for a slightly unexpected reason.

30
00:01:59,180 --> 00:02:02,840
Between working the line, scanning tickets, helping riders load, and manning the terminal

31
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:08,300
to stop the lift in case of accident, a good number of workers are needed to operate each

32
00:02:08,300 --> 00:02:09,300
lift.

33
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:13,060
Then, when you add in all the restaurants, ticket sales, rental shops, stores, hotels,

34
00:02:13,060 --> 00:02:18,100
activities, and everything else a large resort has, it needs thousands of employees, but

35
00:02:18,100 --> 00:02:21,880
getting such huge numbers of workers is quite tough.

36
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:26,380
The nature of the majority of these jobs is that they're low-wage and seasonal.

37
00:02:26,380 --> 00:02:30,540
That means that a resort needs to find a subset of people who are willing to move to the mountain

38
00:02:30,540 --> 00:02:33,940
for five or six months and work for not much.

39
00:02:33,940 --> 00:02:37,900
There are not many people who want to do that, and among those who are, they're typically

40
00:02:37,900 --> 00:02:42,820
young people who will only work a season or two before entering a longer-term career.

41
00:02:42,820 --> 00:02:47,780
Running a ski resort is an enormous and never-ending recruiting mission, and many are unable to

42
00:02:47,780 --> 00:02:51,900
fill all their positions, even when touting significantly better benefits than most other

43
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:57,100
entry-level jobs, at least in the US, like healthcare, transit passes, 401ks, and free

44
00:02:57,100 --> 00:02:58,580
ski passes.

45
00:02:58,580 --> 00:03:03,740
This labor scarcity has pushed wages up for ski jobs, but even with higher wages, they

46
00:03:03,740 --> 00:03:06,340
run into another issue—housing.

47
00:03:06,340 --> 00:03:10,360
The nature of the ski resort's economy is that the towns that ski resorts are in need

48
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:15,900
to be able to accommodate a seasonal doubling or tripling or quadrupling of their population.

49
00:03:16,020 --> 00:03:19,380
Couple that with the fact that resorts tend to be nestled in the mountains, where there

50
00:03:19,380 --> 00:03:24,160
is little flat or semi-flat land where one can build cheap housing, and the urban geography

51
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:26,700
of these areas is wacky.

52
00:03:26,700 --> 00:03:28,660
Take the example of Aspen.

53
00:03:28,660 --> 00:03:33,600
Aspen is home to four ski areas, all operated by the Aspen Skiing Company, and therefore,

54
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:39,200
in the winter, the greater Aspen area is also home to thousands of seasonal workers.

55
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:44,460
Many of these workers are paid the company's base wage of $1,350 an hour, however, Aspen

56
00:03:44,460 --> 00:03:49,420
also happens to be one of the world's most expensive real estate markets.

57
00:03:49,420 --> 00:03:53,980
The reason for that is, as usual, a byproduct of supply and demand.

58
00:03:53,980 --> 00:03:57,780
Housing supply is quite low as the town is nestled at the end of a mountain valley with,

59
00:03:57,780 --> 00:04:00,300
in the winter, only one road in or out.

60
00:04:00,300 --> 00:04:03,040
Housing supply for small apartments is even lower.

61
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:08,660
The average price per square foot of a home in Aspen is nearly $1,700.

62
00:04:08,660 --> 00:04:13,040
In comparison, in Manhattan, New York, it's under $1,400.

63
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:17,640
Of course, no matter how much they pay, Aspen Skiing Company isn't going to get workers

64
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:19,900
unless they have somewhere to live.

65
00:04:19,900 --> 00:04:23,740
While prices decrease as one descends down valley, for the most part, there would be

66
00:04:23,740 --> 00:04:29,120
no chance of housing thousands of low-wage workers using the free market, so Aspen Skiing

67
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:33,540
Company's solution is to provide subsidized employee housing at prices that all their

68
00:04:33,540 --> 00:04:35,200
workers can afford.

69
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:40,740
So, while a ski resort may be able to pay their employees $1,350 an hour, their employees

70
00:04:40,740 --> 00:04:43,780
cost them quite a bit more than that.

71
00:04:43,780 --> 00:04:48,220
There is, however, another unique byproduct of the ski town labor market.

72
00:04:48,220 --> 00:04:52,500
The masses of seasonal workers often don't bring cars with them, so they need ways to

73
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:53,500
get around.

74
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:59,620
Now, the US is not known for its public transportation systems, and is known even less for its rural

75
00:04:59,620 --> 00:05:05,140
public transportation systems, but American ski towns are often an exception to this.

76
00:05:05,140 --> 00:05:09,500
Many have public transportation systems that rival those of big cities.

77
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:14,260
Colorado, home to many of the US's most popular ski resorts, leads the nation in terms

78
00:05:14,260 --> 00:05:17,480
of ridership on its rural transportation systems.

79
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:22,540
Of these, the system with the highest ridership is Aspen's, with more than 5 million passengers

80
00:05:22,540 --> 00:05:23,540
per year.

81
00:05:23,540 --> 00:05:28,580
That's remarkable for a town of 7,000, even though the system extends far beyond, and

82
00:05:28,580 --> 00:05:34,380
its core routes have buses every 12 minutes or more—again, rivaling many routes in big

83
00:05:34,380 --> 00:05:35,380
cities.

84
00:05:35,380 --> 00:05:40,820
This system, much like those of all of Colorado's ski towns, is crucial to get workers in and

85
00:05:40,820 --> 00:05:45,660
out of the area, and it represents the symbiotic relationship ski resorts and the towns they're

86
00:05:45,660 --> 00:05:47,800
located in often have.

87
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:51,740
Ski resorts need their ski towns to set themselves up in a way that's accommodating for their

88
00:05:51,740 --> 00:05:57,340
workers and guests, while ski towns need ski resorts in order to stay ski towns.

89
00:05:57,340 --> 00:06:00,000
But here's something strange.

90
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:04,960
Most big ski resorts, at least in the US, don't actually own the land they operate

91
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:05,960
on.

92
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:10,440
It's government land, and the resorts only hold permits to use the land.

93
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:16,680
This means that the land upon which one skis is public land and so, with some restrictions,

94
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:21,160
anyone can use the land regardless of whether or not they have a lift ticket.

95
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:26,360
At American resorts sitting on US Forest Service land, of which there are 122, people legally

96
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:30,680
can and do hike uphill and then ski down without a pass.

97
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:36,040
Therefore, technically, what the resorts are selling is access to the lifts themselves,

98
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:37,960
not the mountains.

99
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:42,440
Despite this, though, people obviously wouldn't pay to ride those lifts up unless the skiing

100
00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:47,120
down was good, so resorts spend huge amounts of money building and maintaining the downhill

101
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:48,120
runs.

102
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:51,760
Some of this only needs to happen once a year, like trimming any trees trying to grow in

103
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:56,460
the middle of runs in summer, while some needs to happen every night.

104
00:06:56,460 --> 00:07:02,280
Snow quality can vary a lot and, without attention, can get bad quickly, so therefore, every night

105
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:06,360
snowcats go out to groom the easier and more frequented runs.

106
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:10,840
But sometimes, grooming isn't enough to keep snow quality good.

107
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:14,600
Sometimes, there just isn't enough snow.

108
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:18,600
The one solution to that, aside from wading, is snowmaking.

109
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:23,760
There are many different designs of snowguns but they all essentially work the same way—they

110
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:27,140
spray out tiny droplets of water that quickly freeze.

111
00:07:27,140 --> 00:07:31,600
Of course, that still requires temperatures to be below freezing, but this is common in

112
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:34,360
nighttime in even more temperate areas.

113
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:39,240
Some resorts, especially smaller ones in warmer locations, rely almost fully on artificial

114
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:44,200
snow while larger resorts use it to extend their season or build up snowpack on high-use

115
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:45,200
areas.

116
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:47,660
There are, though, disadvantages to this.

117
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:52,100
From the ski resorts perspective, the main one is that it's hugely expensive.

118
00:07:52,100 --> 00:07:56,620
Constructing a system over a vast mountain area is expensive, sourcing the large quantities

119
00:07:56,620 --> 00:08:02,540
of water needed is difficult, and then the process itself is extremely energy-intensive.

120
00:08:02,540 --> 00:08:07,400
Exact costs vary, given the number of variables involved, but in general, snowmaking enough

121
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:12,220
to cover an acre of terrain costs an average of $5,000.

122
00:08:12,220 --> 00:08:16,240
That means that, to fully cover one of the largest resorts, like Whistler Blackcomb,

123
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:22,700
in snow, it would cost more than $40 million, and of course, all of that can melt in a few

124
00:08:22,700 --> 00:08:24,360
warm days.

125
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:29,280
In practice, though, none of the larger resorts rely so heavily on artificial snow, at least

126
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:35,680
right now, but snowmaking still represents a huge cost for resorts large and small.

127
00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:40,640
The snow sports business is, understandably, one of the most threatened industries by climate

128
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:43,280
change and the rising temperatures it can bring.

129
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:47,800
Now, the projected effects of climate change on mountainous areas are complicated.

130
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:52,200
It's not as simple as saying that temperatures are going to be higher and therefore it will

131
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:53,360
snow less.

132
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:58,240
In some places, the change in global climate will actually bring more precipitation and

133
00:08:58,240 --> 00:08:59,840
therefore more snow.

134
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:02,400
In most, though, it's the opposite.

135
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:07,360
Lower altitude and more southern resorts especially will see their season lengths shrink and shrink

136
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:08,360
and shrink.

137
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:12,880
Eventually, and many of these, the number of days they stay open will not be enough

138
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:17,780
to pay the bills, especially as the use of expensive snowmaking increases.

139
00:09:17,780 --> 00:09:21,680
Higher altitude and more northern resorts will actually likely benefit from this, at

140
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:26,940
least in the short term, as more people travel to them faced with fewer alternatives.

141
00:09:26,940 --> 00:09:30,820
Looking at what's to come, the industry has become cognizant of this storm ahead and

142
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:34,580
started to make changes to address its primary threat.

143
00:09:34,580 --> 00:09:39,560
While some are physical changes, like building more snowmaking capacity, most are changes

144
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:41,840
to the way they do business.

145
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:46,200
Money can overcome nature, at least for a while, so what they're doing is making sure

146
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:47,520
the money's still coming in.

147
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:54,460
Consequently, the North American ski industry has seen massive consolidation in recent years.

148
00:09:54,460 --> 00:09:59,120
This trend only started in earnest five years ago when Vail Resorts, the company that owns

149
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:01,560
Vail, went on a spending spree.

150
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:04,920
In 2015, the company owned 11 resorts.

151
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:09,280
Now, five years later, they own 37.

152
00:10:09,280 --> 00:10:14,520
The link this has to climate change is that now, Vail Resorts, which is a public company,

153
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:18,800
has properties spread out across different climates so, for example, if there's a bad

154
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:23,120
snow year in the Rockies, they always have properties in British Columbia where the snow

155
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:24,120
might be better.

156
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:29,880
They even own resorts in Australia, so Vail spins lifts somewhere on earth nearly year

157
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:30,880
round.

158
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:36,080
Not to be outdone, Aspen Skiing Company, which runs the four famous Aspen area resorts, teamed

159
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:41,180
up with KSL Capital Partners, a private equity firm, in 2018 and formed a joint venture to

160
00:10:41,180 --> 00:10:44,200
compete against Vail, Altera Mountain Company.

161
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:49,080
Altera now owns a more modest 15 resorts across the US and Canada.

162
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:53,340
With the resorts they own and partner with, both of these companies released offerings

163
00:10:53,340 --> 00:10:57,080
that are changing the financial formula of the ski industry.

164
00:10:57,080 --> 00:11:02,280
For Vail, it's the Epic Pass, for Altera, it's the Icon Pass, but for both of them,

165
00:11:02,280 --> 00:11:06,800
these are essentially season passes that, instead of working at just one place, work

166
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:10,120
at dozens of resorts worldwide.

167
00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:15,280
This is a killer competitive move against independent resorts since, in many ways, these

168
00:11:15,280 --> 00:11:18,800
are better for the consumer and better for the company.

169
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:23,680
The consumer gets variety and flexibility at prices not much different than single-resort

170
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:29,080
season passes, while the companies are selling more season passes, which is exactly what

171
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:30,080
they want.

172
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:34,060
That's because season passes hedge risk.

173
00:11:34,060 --> 00:11:38,440
Even though they'll make more money in a day from someone buying a single-day pass,

174
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:42,300
those buying those day passes are highly weather-dependent.

175
00:11:42,300 --> 00:11:45,080
If there's tons of snow, they'll send tons of day passes.

176
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:48,540
If there's little snow, they'll sell barely any.

177
00:11:48,540 --> 00:11:52,920
Nobody wants their quarterly-earning reports to depend too much on the weather, especially

178
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:57,840
as it's getting worse, and so, by getting more of their customers onto season passes,

179
00:11:57,840 --> 00:12:01,500
which are typically sold before the start of the season when there are few indications

180
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:06,000
of the season's snowfall, the consumer is sharing the risk with the company, and revenue

181
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,960
variability year-to-year will lower.

182
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:14,020
This is a crucial shift for the ski companies as year-to-year snow variation is expected

183
00:12:14,020 --> 00:12:15,800
to only pick up.

184
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:21,680
So, in all, the real shift the ski industry is having to make is not how they run their

185
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:24,880
slopes, but rather how they make money.

186
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:30,300
For them, while they still might lobby, fundraise, and rally against it, they're now at a point

187
00:12:30,300 --> 00:12:35,400
where reality is imminent, and climate change is all but another component of their financial

188
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:38,060
plans.

189
00:12:38,060 --> 00:12:42,100
If you want a little bit more of the action side of snow sports and a little bit less

190
00:12:42,100 --> 00:12:47,680
of the business side, believe it or not, CuriosityStream has something for you to watch next.

191
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:52,660
The series Jeremy Jones Hire follows professional snowboarder Jeremy Jones as he attempts to

192
00:12:52,660 --> 00:12:57,120
be the first person to snowboard down sections of the Himalayas and shows everything that

193
00:12:57,120 --> 00:13:01,240
goes on behind the scenes of an expedition as huge as that.

194
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:06,160
This goes to demonstrate just how diverse the selection of non-fiction shows and documentaries

195
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:11,580
CuriosityStream has, and they have even more through their bundle deal with Nebula.

196
00:13:11,580 --> 00:13:17,300
Now, your CuriosityStream subscription, if you sign up at CuriosityStream.com slash Wendover,

197
00:13:17,300 --> 00:13:20,060
comes with a Nebula subscription, too.

198
00:13:20,060 --> 00:13:24,300
On Nebula, you'll find all the regular videos from loads of your favorite creators,

199
00:13:24,300 --> 00:13:28,040
plus a bunch of their big, special, exclusive projects.

200
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:33,260
The first of mine was the documentary we made on St Helena, and then, in a few weeks, myself

201
00:13:33,260 --> 00:13:38,100
and a crew are flying off to another far-flung part of the world to film our next documentary,

202
00:13:38,100 --> 00:13:40,160
which will be out on Nebula soon.

203
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:44,560
You can watch this, plus all the other great originals on Nebula, plus the thousands of

204
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:49,700
documentaries and shows on CuriosityStream, for as little as $20 a year by signing up

205
00:13:49,700 --> 00:13:52,700
at CuriosityStream.com slash Wendover.

206
00:13:52,700 --> 00:13:57,980
This is truly the best deal in streaming, and even better, it goes to help support independent

207
00:13:57,980 --> 00:13:58,760
creators.
