10440	13440	There are few sports as expensive as skiing.
13440	19060	A daily lift ticket alone typically costs more than $100 with top resorts such as Vail
19060	22640	charging up to $209 for a day's skiing.
22640	25560	It'd be easy to call this a rip-off.
25560	31100	After all, all those $209 are getting you is access, along with thousands of other people,
31100	36180	to one of 32 lifts between the hours of 8.30am and 3.30pm.
36180	39600	Does it really cost that much for a resort to run a few lifts?
39600	42900	Well, the short answer is sort of.
42900	45520	Ski lifts are a simple enough concept.
45520	49820	With the most common design, chairs, each with a capacity between 1 and 8, are connected
49820	54880	to a continuously rotating cable pulled by motors at the top or bottom of the lift.
54880	60240	Given all the redundancies and safety systems, though, they end up being fairly complex machines,
60240	62240	and complex means expensive.
62240	67520	While it varies widely depending on length, capacity, specifications, and location, costs
67520	73540	for the construction of a new lift alone regularly reach $10 million and most large ski resorts
73540	75620	have dozens of lifts.
75620	78800	In Vail's case, once again, they have 32.
78800	82760	That means that, even if they were all the kinds of lifts that cost $10 million, which
82760	87520	are not, that would total to $320 million.
87520	92740	Those $320 million are divided by a lift lifespan of a few dozen years, then divided further
92740	96760	by the hundreds of thousands of yearly visitors who are each paying up to hundreds of dollars
96760	101660	per day, and you can start to see, pretty quickly, that it is not because of building
101660	104220	lifts that skiing is expensive.
104220	108380	The paradox of ski resorts is that buying and installing ski lifts, which are their
108380	114340	primary physical assets, only represents a small proportion of their costs.
114340	119180	Actually running ski lifts is trickier, but for a slightly unexpected reason.
119180	122840	Between working the line, scanning tickets, helping riders load, and manning the terminal
122840	128300	to stop the lift in case of accident, a good number of workers are needed to operate each
128300	129300	lift.
129300	133060	Then, when you add in all the restaurants, ticket sales, rental shops, stores, hotels,
133060	138100	activities, and everything else a large resort has, it needs thousands of employees, but
138100	141880	getting such huge numbers of workers is quite tough.
141880	146380	The nature of the majority of these jobs is that they're low-wage and seasonal.
146380	150540	That means that a resort needs to find a subset of people who are willing to move to the mountain
150540	153940	for five or six months and work for not much.
153940	157900	There are not many people who want to do that, and among those who are, they're typically
157900	162820	young people who will only work a season or two before entering a longer-term career.
162820	167780	Running a ski resort is an enormous and never-ending recruiting mission, and many are unable to
167780	171900	fill all their positions, even when touting significantly better benefits than most other
171900	177100	entry-level jobs, at least in the US, like healthcare, transit passes, 401ks, and free
177100	178580	ski passes.
178580	183740	This labor scarcity has pushed wages up for ski jobs, but even with higher wages, they
183740	186340	run into another issue—housing.
186340	190360	The nature of the ski resort's economy is that the towns that ski resorts are in need
190360	195900	to be able to accommodate a seasonal doubling or tripling or quadrupling of their population.
196020	199380	Couple that with the fact that resorts tend to be nestled in the mountains, where there
199380	204160	is little flat or semi-flat land where one can build cheap housing, and the urban geography
204160	206700	of these areas is wacky.
206700	208660	Take the example of Aspen.
208660	213600	Aspen is home to four ski areas, all operated by the Aspen Skiing Company, and therefore,
213600	219200	in the winter, the greater Aspen area is also home to thousands of seasonal workers.
219200	224460	Many of these workers are paid the company's base wage of $1,350 an hour, however, Aspen
224460	229420	also happens to be one of the world's most expensive real estate markets.
229420	233980	The reason for that is, as usual, a byproduct of supply and demand.
233980	237780	Housing supply is quite low as the town is nestled at the end of a mountain valley with,
237780	240300	in the winter, only one road in or out.
240300	243040	Housing supply for small apartments is even lower.
243040	248660	The average price per square foot of a home in Aspen is nearly $1,700.
248660	253040	In comparison, in Manhattan, New York, it's under $1,400.
253040	257640	Of course, no matter how much they pay, Aspen Skiing Company isn't going to get workers
257640	259900	unless they have somewhere to live.
259900	263740	While prices decrease as one descends down valley, for the most part, there would be
263740	269120	no chance of housing thousands of low-wage workers using the free market, so Aspen Skiing
269120	273540	Company's solution is to provide subsidized employee housing at prices that all their
273540	275200	workers can afford.
275200	280740	So, while a ski resort may be able to pay their employees $1,350 an hour, their employees
280740	283780	cost them quite a bit more than that.
283780	288220	There is, however, another unique byproduct of the ski town labor market.
288220	292500	The masses of seasonal workers often don't bring cars with them, so they need ways to
292500	293500	get around.
293500	299620	Now, the US is not known for its public transportation systems, and is known even less for its rural
299620	305140	public transportation systems, but American ski towns are often an exception to this.
305140	309500	Many have public transportation systems that rival those of big cities.
309500	314260	Colorado, home to many of the US's most popular ski resorts, leads the nation in terms
314260	317480	of ridership on its rural transportation systems.
317480	322540	Of these, the system with the highest ridership is Aspen's, with more than 5 million passengers
322540	323540	per year.
323540	328580	That's remarkable for a town of 7,000, even though the system extends far beyond, and
328580	334380	its core routes have buses every 12 minutes or more—again, rivaling many routes in big
334380	335380	cities.
335380	340820	This system, much like those of all of Colorado's ski towns, is crucial to get workers in and
340820	345660	out of the area, and it represents the symbiotic relationship ski resorts and the towns they're
345660	347800	located in often have.
347800	351740	Ski resorts need their ski towns to set themselves up in a way that's accommodating for their
351740	357340	workers and guests, while ski towns need ski resorts in order to stay ski towns.
357340	360000	But here's something strange.
360000	364960	Most big ski resorts, at least in the US, don't actually own the land they operate
364960	365960	on.
365960	370440	It's government land, and the resorts only hold permits to use the land.
370440	376680	This means that the land upon which one skis is public land and so, with some restrictions,
376680	381160	anyone can use the land regardless of whether or not they have a lift ticket.
381160	386360	At American resorts sitting on US Forest Service land, of which there are 122, people legally
386360	390680	can and do hike uphill and then ski down without a pass.
390680	396040	Therefore, technically, what the resorts are selling is access to the lifts themselves,
396040	397960	not the mountains.
397960	402440	Despite this, though, people obviously wouldn't pay to ride those lifts up unless the skiing
402440	407120	down was good, so resorts spend huge amounts of money building and maintaining the downhill
407120	408120	runs.
408120	411760	Some of this only needs to happen once a year, like trimming any trees trying to grow in
411760	416460	the middle of runs in summer, while some needs to happen every night.
416460	422280	Snow quality can vary a lot and, without attention, can get bad quickly, so therefore, every night
422280	426360	snowcats go out to groom the easier and more frequented runs.
426360	430840	But sometimes, grooming isn't enough to keep snow quality good.
430840	434600	Sometimes, there just isn't enough snow.
434600	438600	The one solution to that, aside from wading, is snowmaking.
438600	443760	There are many different designs of snowguns but they all essentially work the same way—they
443760	447140	spray out tiny droplets of water that quickly freeze.
447140	451600	Of course, that still requires temperatures to be below freezing, but this is common in
451600	454360	nighttime in even more temperate areas.
454360	459240	Some resorts, especially smaller ones in warmer locations, rely almost fully on artificial
459240	464200	snow while larger resorts use it to extend their season or build up snowpack on high-use
464200	465200	areas.
465200	467660	There are, though, disadvantages to this.
467720	472100	From the ski resorts perspective, the main one is that it's hugely expensive.
472100	476620	Constructing a system over a vast mountain area is expensive, sourcing the large quantities
476620	482540	of water needed is difficult, and then the process itself is extremely energy-intensive.
482540	487400	Exact costs vary, given the number of variables involved, but in general, snowmaking enough
487400	492220	to cover an acre of terrain costs an average of $5,000.
492220	496240	That means that, to fully cover one of the largest resorts, like Whistler Blackcomb,
496240	502700	in snow, it would cost more than $40 million, and of course, all of that can melt in a few
502700	504360	warm days.
504360	509280	In practice, though, none of the larger resorts rely so heavily on artificial snow, at least
509280	515680	right now, but snowmaking still represents a huge cost for resorts large and small.
515680	520640	The snow sports business is, understandably, one of the most threatened industries by climate
520640	523280	change and the rising temperatures it can bring.
523320	527800	Now, the projected effects of climate change on mountainous areas are complicated.
527800	532200	It's not as simple as saying that temperatures are going to be higher and therefore it will
532200	533360	snow less.
533360	538240	In some places, the change in global climate will actually bring more precipitation and
538240	539840	therefore more snow.
539840	542400	In most, though, it's the opposite.
542400	547360	Lower altitude and more southern resorts especially will see their season lengths shrink and shrink
547360	548360	and shrink.
548360	552880	Eventually, and many of these, the number of days they stay open will not be enough
552880	557780	to pay the bills, especially as the use of expensive snowmaking increases.
557780	561680	Higher altitude and more northern resorts will actually likely benefit from this, at
561680	566940	least in the short term, as more people travel to them faced with fewer alternatives.
566940	570820	Looking at what's to come, the industry has become cognizant of this storm ahead and
570820	574580	started to make changes to address its primary threat.
574580	579560	While some are physical changes, like building more snowmaking capacity, most are changes
579560	581840	to the way they do business.
581840	586200	Money can overcome nature, at least for a while, so what they're doing is making sure
586200	587520	the money's still coming in.
587520	594460	Consequently, the North American ski industry has seen massive consolidation in recent years.
594460	599120	This trend only started in earnest five years ago when Vail Resorts, the company that owns
599120	601560	Vail, went on a spending spree.
601560	604920	In 2015, the company owned 11 resorts.
604920	609280	Now, five years later, they own 37.
609280	614520	The link this has to climate change is that now, Vail Resorts, which is a public company,
614520	618800	has properties spread out across different climates so, for example, if there's a bad
618800	623120	snow year in the Rockies, they always have properties in British Columbia where the snow
623120	624120	might be better.
624120	629880	They even own resorts in Australia, so Vail spins lifts somewhere on earth nearly year
629880	630880	round.
630880	636080	Not to be outdone, Aspen Skiing Company, which runs the four famous Aspen area resorts, teamed
636080	641180	up with KSL Capital Partners, a private equity firm, in 2018 and formed a joint venture to
641180	644200	compete against Vail, Altera Mountain Company.
644200	649080	Altera now owns a more modest 15 resorts across the US and Canada.
649080	653340	With the resorts they own and partner with, both of these companies released offerings
653340	657080	that are changing the financial formula of the ski industry.
657080	662280	For Vail, it's the Epic Pass, for Altera, it's the Icon Pass, but for both of them,
662280	666800	these are essentially season passes that, instead of working at just one place, work
666800	670120	at dozens of resorts worldwide.
670120	675280	This is a killer competitive move against independent resorts since, in many ways, these
675280	678800	are better for the consumer and better for the company.
678800	683680	The consumer gets variety and flexibility at prices not much different than single-resort
683680	689080	season passes, while the companies are selling more season passes, which is exactly what
689080	690080	they want.
690080	694060	That's because season passes hedge risk.
694060	698440	Even though they'll make more money in a day from someone buying a single-day pass,
698440	702300	those buying those day passes are highly weather-dependent.
702300	705080	If there's tons of snow, they'll send tons of day passes.
705080	708540	If there's little snow, they'll sell barely any.
708540	712920	Nobody wants their quarterly-earning reports to depend too much on the weather, especially
712920	717840	as it's getting worse, and so, by getting more of their customers onto season passes,
717840	721500	which are typically sold before the start of the season when there are few indications
721500	726000	of the season's snowfall, the consumer is sharing the risk with the company, and revenue
726000	728960	variability year-to-year will lower.
728960	734020	This is a crucial shift for the ski companies as year-to-year snow variation is expected
734020	735800	to only pick up.
735800	741680	So, in all, the real shift the ski industry is having to make is not how they run their
741680	744880	slopes, but rather how they make money.
744880	750300	For them, while they still might lobby, fundraise, and rally against it, they're now at a point
750300	755400	where reality is imminent, and climate change is all but another component of their financial
755400	758060	plans.
758060	762100	If you want a little bit more of the action side of snow sports and a little bit less
762100	767680	of the business side, believe it or not, CuriosityStream has something for you to watch next.

772660	777120	be the first person to snowboard down sections of the Himalayas and shows everything that
777120	781240	goes on behind the scenes of an expedition as huge as that.
