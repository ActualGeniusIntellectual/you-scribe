video platform that Wendover is a part of.

00:10.440 --> 00:13.440
There are few sports as expensive as skiing.

00:13.440 --> 00:19.060
A daily lift ticket alone typically costs more than $100 with top resorts such as Vail

00:19.060 --> 00:22.640
charging up to $209 for a day's skiing.

00:22.640 --> 00:25.560
It'd be easy to call this a rip-off.

00:25.560 --> 00:31.100
After all, all those $209 are getting you is access, along with thousands of other people,

00:31.100 --> 00:36.180
to one of 32 lifts between the hours of 8.30am and 3.30pm.

00:36.180 --> 00:39.600
Does it really cost that much for a resort to run a few lifts?

00:39.600 --> 00:42.900
Well, the short answer is sort of.

00:42.900 --> 00:45.520
Ski lifts are a simple enough concept.

00:45.520 --> 00:49.820
With the most common design, chairs, each with a capacity between 1 and 8, are connected

00:49.820 --> 00:54.880
to a continuously rotating cable pulled by motors at the top or bottom of the lift.

00:54.880 --> 01:00.240
Given all the redundancies and safety systems, though, they end up being fairly complex machines,

01:00.240 --> 01:02.240
and complex means expensive.

01:02.240 --> 01:07.520
While it varies widely depending on length, capacity, specifications, and location, costs

01:07.520 --> 01:13.540
for the construction of a new lift alone regularly reach $10 million and most large ski resorts

01:13.540 --> 01:15.620
have dozens of lifts.

01:15.620 --> 01:18.800
In Vail's case, once again, they have 32.

01:18.800 --> 01:22.760
That means that, even if they were all the kinds of lifts that cost $10 million, which

01:22.760 --> 01:27.520
are not, that would total to $320 million.

01:27.520 --> 01:32.740
Those $320 million are divided by a lift lifespan of a few dozen years, then divided further

01:32.740 --> 01:36.760
by the hundreds of thousands of yearly visitors who are each paying up to hundreds of dollars

01:36.760 --> 01:41.660
per day, and you can start to see, pretty quickly, that it is not because of building

01:41.660 --> 01:44.220
lifts that skiing is expensive.

01:44.220 --> 01:48.380
The paradox of ski resorts is that buying and installing ski lifts, which are their

01:48.380 --> 01:54.340
primary physical assets, only represents a small proportion of their costs.

01:54.340 --> 01:59.180
Actually running ski lifts is trickier, but for a slightly unexpected reason.

01:59.180 --> 02:02.840
Between working the line, scanning tickets, helping riders load, and manning the terminal

02:02.840 --> 02:08.300
to stop the lift in case of accident, a good number of workers are needed to operate each

02:08.300 --> 02:09.300
lift.

02:09.300 --> 02:13.060
Then, when you add in all the restaurants, ticket sales, rental shops, stores, hotels,

02:13.060 --> 02:18.100
activities, and everything else a large resort has, it needs thousands of employees, but

02:18.100 --> 02:21.880
getting such huge numbers of workers is quite tough.

02:21.880 --> 02:26.380
The nature of the majority of these jobs is that they're low-wage and seasonal.

02:26.380 --> 02:30.540
That means that a resort needs to find a subset of people who are willing to move to the mountain

02:30.540 --> 02:33.940
for five or six months and work for not much.

02:33.940 --> 02:37.900
There are not many people who want to do that, and among those who are, they're typically

02:37.900 --> 02:42.820
young people who will only work a season or two before entering a longer-term career.

02:42.820 --> 02:47.780
Running a ski resort is an enormous and never-ending recruiting mission, and many are unable to

02:47.780 --> 02:51.900
fill all their positions, even when touting significantly better benefits than most other

02:51.900 --> 02:57.100
entry-level jobs, at least in the US, like healthcare, transit passes, 401ks, and free

02:57.100 --> 02:58.580
ski passes.

02:58.580 --> 03:03.740
This labor scarcity has pushed wages up for ski jobs, but even with higher wages, they

03:03.740 --> 03:06.340
run into another issue—housing.

03:06.340 --> 03:10.360
The nature of the ski resort's economy is that the towns that ski resorts are in need

03:10.360 --> 03:15.900
to be able to accommodate a seasonal doubling or tripling or quadrupling of their population.

03:16.020 --> 03:19.380
Couple that with the fact that resorts tend to be nestled in the mountains, where there

03:19.380 --> 03:24.160
is little flat or semi-flat land where one can build cheap housing, and the urban geography

03:24.160 --> 03:26.700
of these areas is wacky.

03:26.700 --> 03:28.660
Take the example of Aspen.

03:28.660 --> 03:33.600
Aspen is home to four ski areas, all operated by the Aspen Skiing Company, and therefore,

03:33.600 --> 03:39.200
in the winter, the greater Aspen area is also home to thousands of seasonal workers.

03:39.200 --> 03:44.460
Many of these workers are paid the company's base wage of $1,350 an hour, however, Aspen

03:44.460 --> 03:49.420
also happens to be one of the world's most expensive real estate markets.

03:49.420 --> 03:53.980
The reason for that is, as usual, a byproduct of supply and demand.

03:53.980 --> 03:57.780
Housing supply is quite low as the town is nestled at the end of a mountain valley with,

03:57.780 --> 04:00.300
in the winter, only one road in or out.

04:00.300 --> 04:03.040
Housing supply for small apartments is even lower.

04:03.040 --> 04:08.660
The average price per square foot of a home in Aspen is nearly $1,700.

04:08.660 --> 04:13.040
In comparison, in Manhattan, New York, it's under $1,400.

04:13.040 --> 04:17.640
Of course, no matter how much they pay, Aspen Skiing Company isn't going to get workers

04:17.640 --> 04:19.900
unless they have somewhere to live.

04:19.900 --> 04:23.740
While prices decrease as one descends down valley, for the most part, there would be

04:23.740 --> 04:29.120
no chance of housing thousands of low-wage workers using the free market, so Aspen Skiing

04:29.120 --> 04:33.540
Company's solution is to provide subsidized employee housing at prices that all their

04:33.540 --> 04:35.200
workers can afford.

04:35.200 --> 04:40.740
So, while a ski resort may be able to pay their employees $1,350 an hour, their employees

04:40.740 --> 04:43.780
cost them quite a bit more than that.

04:43.780 --> 04:48.220
There is, however, another unique byproduct of the ski town labor market.

04:48.220 --> 04:52.500
The masses of seasonal workers often don't bring cars with them, so they need ways to

04:52.500 --> 04:53.500
get around.

04:53.500 --> 04:59.620
Now, the US is not known for its public transportation systems, and is known even less for its rural

04:59.620 --> 05:05.140
public transportation systems, but American ski towns are often an exception to this.

05:05.140 --> 05:09.500
Many have public transportation systems that rival those of big cities.

05:09.500 --> 05:14.260
Colorado, home to many of the US's most popular ski resorts, leads the nation in terms

05:14.260 --> 05:17.480
of ridership on its rural transportation systems.

05:17.480 --> 05:22.540
Of these, the system with the highest ridership is Aspen's, with more than 5 million passengers

05:22.540 --> 05:23.540
per year.

05:23.540 --> 05:28.580
That's remarkable for a town of 7,000, even though the system extends far beyond, and

05:28.580 --> 05:34.380
its core routes have buses every 12 minutes or more—again, rivaling many routes in big

05:34.380 --> 05:35.380
cities.

05:35.380 --> 05:40.820
This system, much like those of all of Colorado's ski towns, is crucial to get workers in and

05:40.820 --> 05:45.660
out of the area, and it represents the symbiotic relationship ski resorts and the towns they're

05:45.660 --> 05:47.800
located in often have.

05:47.800 --> 05:51.740
Ski resorts need their ski towns to set themselves up in a way that's accommodating for their

05:51.740 --> 05:57.340
workers and guests, while ski towns need ski resorts in order to stay ski towns.

05:57.340 --> 06:00.000
But here's something strange.

06:00.000 --> 06:04.960
Most big ski resorts, at least in the US, don't actually own the land they operate

06:04.960 --> 06:05.960
on.

06:05.960 --> 06:10.440
It's government land, and the resorts only hold permits to use the land.

06:10.440 --> 06:16.680
This means that the land upon which one skis is public land and so, with some restrictions,

06:16.680 --> 06:21.160
anyone can use the land regardless of whether or not they have a lift ticket.

06:21.160 --> 06:26.360
At American resorts sitting on US Forest Service land, of which there are 122, people legally

06:26.360 --> 06:30.680
can and do hike uphill and then ski down without a pass.

06:30.680 --> 06:36.040
Therefore, technically, what the resorts are selling is access to the lifts themselves,

06:36.040 --> 06:37.960
not the mountains.

06:37.960 --> 06:42.440
Despite this, though, people obviously wouldn't pay to ride those lifts up unless the skiing

06:42.440 --> 06:47.120
down was good, so resorts spend huge amounts of money building and maintaining the downhill

06:47.120 --> 06:48.120
runs.

06:48.120 --> 06:51.760
Some of this only needs to happen once a year, like trimming any trees trying to grow in

06:51.760 --> 06:56.460
the middle of runs in summer, while some needs to happen every night.

06:56.460 --> 07:02.280
Snow quality can vary a lot and, without attention, can get bad quickly, so therefore, every night

07:02.280 --> 07:06.360
snowcats go out to groom the easier and more frequented runs.

07:06.360 --> 07:10.840
But sometimes, grooming isn't enough to keep snow quality good.

07:10.840 --> 07:14.600
Sometimes, there just isn't enough snow.

07:14.600 --> 07:18.600
The one solution to that, aside from wading, is snowmaking.

07:18.600 --> 07:23.760
There are many different designs of snowguns but they all essentially work the same way—they

07:23.760 --> 07:27.140
spray out tiny droplets of water that quickly freeze.

07:27.140 --> 07:31.600
Of course, that still requires temperatures to be below freezing, but this is common in

07:31.600 --> 07:34.360
nighttime in even more temperate areas.

07:34.360 --> 07:39.240
Some resorts, especially smaller ones in warmer locations, rely almost fully on artificial

07:39.240 --> 07:44.200
snow while larger resorts use it to extend their season or build up snowpack on high-use

07:44.200 --> 07:45.200
areas.

07:45.200 --> 07:47.660
There are, though, disadvantages to this.

07:47.720 --> 07:52.100
From the ski resorts perspective, the main one is that it's hugely expensive.

07:52.100 --> 07:56.620
Constructing a system over a vast mountain area is expensive, sourcing the large quantities

07:56.620 --> 08:02.540
of water needed is difficult, and then the process itself is extremely energy-intensive.

08:02.540 --> 08:07.400
Exact costs vary, given the number of variables involved, but in general, snowmaking enough

08:07.400 --> 08:12.220
to cover an acre of terrain costs an average of $5,000.

08:12.220 --> 08:16.240
That means that, to fully cover one of the largest resorts, like Whistler Blackcomb,

08:16.240 --> 08:22.700
in snow, it would cost more than $40 million, and of course, all of that can melt in a few

08:22.700 --> 08:24.360
warm days.

08:24.360 --> 08:29.280
In practice, though, none of the larger resorts rely so heavily on artificial snow, at least

08:29.280 --> 08:35.680
right now, but snowmaking still represents a huge cost for resorts large and small.

08:35.680 --> 08:40.640
The snow sports business is, understandably, one of the most threatened industries by climate

08:40.640 --> 08:43.280
change and the rising temperatures it can bring.

08:43.320 --> 08:47.800
Now, the projected effects of climate change on mountainous areas are complicated.

08:47.800 --> 08:52.200
It's not as simple as saying that temperatures are going to be higher and therefore it will

08:52.200 --> 08:53.360
snow less.

08:53.360 --> 08:58.240
In some places, the change in global climate will actually bring more precipitation and

08:58.240 --> 08:59.840
therefore more snow.

08:59.840 --> 09:02.400
In most, though, it's the opposite.

09:02.400 --> 09:07.360
Lower altitude and more southern resorts especially will see their season lengths shrink and shrink

09:07.360 --> 09:08.360
and shrink.

09:08.360 --> 09:12.880
Eventually, and many of these, the number of days they stay open will not be enough

09:12.880 --> 09:17.780
to pay the bills, especially as the use of expensive snowmaking increases.

09:17.780 --> 09:21.680
Higher altitude and more northern resorts will actually likely benefit from this, at

09:21.680 --> 09:26.940
least in the short term, as more people travel to them faced with fewer alternatives.

09:26.940 --> 09:30.820
Looking at what's to come, the industry has become cognizant of this storm ahead and

09:30.820 --> 09:34.580
started to make changes to address its primary threat.

09:34.580 --> 09:39.560
While some are physical changes, like building more snowmaking capacity, most are changes

09:39.560 --> 09:41.840
to the way they do business.

09:41.840 --> 09:46.200
Money can overcome nature, at least for a while, so what they're doing is making sure

09:46.200 --> 09:47.520
the money's still coming in.

09:47.520 --> 09:54.460
Consequently, the North American ski industry has seen massive consolidation in recent years.

09:54.460 --> 09:59.120
This trend only started in earnest five years ago when Vail Resorts, the company that owns

09:59.120 --> 10:01.560
Vail, went on a spending spree.

10:01.560 --> 10:04.920
In 2015, the company owned 11 resorts.

10:04.920 --> 10:09.280
Now, five years later, they own 37.

10:09.280 --> 10:14.520
The link this has to climate change is that now, Vail Resorts, which is a public company,

10:14.520 --> 10:18.800
has properties spread out across different climates so, for example, if there's a bad

10:18.800 --> 10:23.120
snow year in the Rockies, they always have properties in British Columbia where the snow

10:23.120 --> 10:24.120
might be better.

10:24.120 --> 10:29.880
They even own resorts in Australia, so Vail spins lifts somewhere on earth nearly year

10:29.880 --> 10:30.880
round.

10:30.880 --> 10:36.080
Not to be outdone, Aspen Skiing Company, which runs the four famous Aspen area resorts, teamed

10:36.080 --> 10:41.180
up with KSL Capital Partners, a private equity firm, in 2018 and formed a joint venture to

10:41.180 --> 10:44.200
compete against Vail, Altera Mountain Company.

10:44.200 --> 10:49.080
Altera now owns a more modest 15 resorts across the US and Canada.

10:49.080 --> 10:53.340
With the resorts they own and partner with, both of these companies released offerings

10:53.340 --> 10:57.080
that are changing the financial formula of the ski industry.

10:57.080 --> 11:02.280
For Vail, it's the Epic Pass, for Altera, it's the Icon Pass, but for both of them,

11:02.280 --> 11:06.800
these are essentially season passes that, instead of working at just one place, work

11:06.800 --> 11:10.120
at dozens of resorts worldwide.

11:10.120 --> 11:15.280
This is a killer competitive move against independent resorts since, in many ways, these

11:15.280 --> 11:18.800
are better for the consumer and better for the company.

11:18.800 --> 11:23.680
The consumer gets variety and flexibility at prices not much different than single-resort

11:23.680 --> 11:29.080
season passes, while the companies are selling more season passes, which is exactly what

11:29.080 --> 11:30.080
they want.

11:30.080 --> 11:34.060
That's because season passes hedge risk.

11:34.060 --> 11:38.440
Even though they'll make more money in a day from someone buying a single-day pass,

11:38.440 --> 11:42.300
those buying those day passes are highly weather-dependent.

11:42.300 --> 11:45.080
If there's tons of snow, they'll send tons of day passes.

11:45.080 --> 11:48.540
If there's little snow, they'll sell barely any.

11:48.540 --> 11:52.920
Nobody wants their quarterly-earning reports to depend too much on the weather, especially

11:52.920 --> 11:57.840
as it's getting worse, and so, by getting more of their customers onto season passes,

11:57.840 --> 12:01.500
which are typically sold before the start of the season when there are few indications

12:01.500 --> 12:06.000
of the season's snowfall, the consumer is sharing the risk with the company, and revenue

12:06.000 --> 12:08.960
variability year-to-year will lower.

12:08.960 --> 12:14.020
This is a crucial shift for the ski companies as year-to-year snow variation is expected

12:14.020 --> 12:15.800
to only pick up.

12:15.800 --> 12:21.680
So, in all, the real shift the ski industry is having to make is not how they run their

12:21.680 --> 12:24.880
slopes, but rather how they make money.

12:24.880 --> 12:30.300
For them, while they still might lobby, fundraise, and rally against it, they're now at a point

12:30.300 --> 12:35.400
where reality is imminent, and climate change is all but another component of their financial

12:35.400 --> 12:38.060
plans.

12:38.060 --> 12:42.100
If you want a little bit more of the action side of snow sports and a little bit less

12:42.100 --> 12:47.680
of the business side, believe it or not, CuriosityStream has something for you to watch next.

12:47.680 --> 12:52.660
The series Jeremy Jones Hire follows professional snowboarder Jeremy Jones as he attempts to

12:52.660 --> 12:57.120
be the first person to snowboard down sections of the Himalayas and shows everything that

12:57.120 --> 13:01.240
goes on behind the scenes of an expedition as huge as that.

13:01.240 --> 13:06.160
This goes to demonstrate just how diverse the selection of non-fiction shows and documentaries

13:06.160 --> 13:11.580
CuriosityStream has, and they have even more through their bundle deal with Nebula.

13:11.580 --> 13:17.300
Now, your CuriosityStream subscription, if you sign up at CuriosityStream.com slash Wendover,

13:17.300 --> 13:20.060

13:24.300 --> 13:28.040
plus a bunch of their big, special, exclusive projects.

13:28.040 --> 13:33.260
The first of mine was the documentary we made on St Helena, and then, in a few weeks, myself

13:33.260 --> 13:38.100
and a crew are flying off to another far-flung part of the world to film our next documentary,

13:38.100 --> 13:40.160
which will be out on Nebula soon.

13:40.160 --> 13:44.560
You can watch this, plus all the other great originals on Nebula, plus the thousands of

13:44.560 --> 13:49.700
