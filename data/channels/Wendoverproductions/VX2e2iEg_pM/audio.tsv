10040	14840	I need not tell you what happened in March, 2020.
14840	19060	Whether you're watching this now or far in the future, that date will forever remain
19060	23380	in people's minds as when the century's first pandemic emerged.
23380	27560	It will remain in people's minds as when the era of social distancing and isolation
27560	28680	began.
28680	32880	It will remain in people's minds as when they got sick, or when a loved one got sick,
32880	33960	or worse.
33960	38600	In addition, though, for the millions of people worldwide working in the aviation industry,
38600	44640	March, 2020 will mark the date when they lost their jobs—when their company started turning
44640	45680	south.
45680	48580	It will mark the beginning of the end.
48580	54160	There is perhaps no industry more severely impacted by COVID-19 than aviation.
54160	59660	As it is a brand new virus, in these early days, when there is no immunity or vaccines,
59660	65260	the only way to stop or slow its spread is through physically isolating people.
65260	70680	That is intrinsically in opposition to what aviation is—aviation works to bring people
70680	71680	together.
71680	75600	That meant that one of the first measures governments implemented to slow the spread
75600	77440	was to ban travel.
77440	82200	When the virus first emerged, its transmission primarily occurred in China, with only isolated
82200	85760	cases elsewhere from those who had traveled from the epicenter.
85760	89960	For this issue, the solution was simple—ban travel from China.
89960	94280	A number of countries, notably including the US, barred foreigners who had recently been
94280	99080	in China from entering their borders and, in response to the sharp decline in demand,
99080	102620	a number of airlines cancelled their flights to Greater China.
102620	107140	The financial implications of this were limited, as few foreign airlines are significantly
107140	111800	exposed to China, partly due to the strength of the Chinese airlines.
111800	115640	Most of those mainland Chinese airlines, meanwhile, are government-owned so they could
115640	117040	take the hit.
117040	121600	Of course nearby Asian airlines like Scoot, Cathay Pacific, and ANA would struggle, but
121600	125280	the lockdown of China was more or less a weatherable hit.
125280	128420	But then, the virus spread.
128420	131720	First to South Korea, so airlines cancelled flights to South Korea.
131720	134840	Then to Iran, so airlines cancelled flights to Iran.
134840	137700	Then to Italy, so airlines cancelled flights to Italy.
137920	143120	Then it seeped through Italy's porous borders to take hold of the entirety of Europe.
143120	147840	That was the moment when, to airlines, the situation became severe.
147840	153020	Europe is home to, by revenue, three of the world's six largest airlines—the Lufthansa
153020	156140	Group, Air France KLM, and IAG.
156140	161420	To have a virus devastating their home territory was an untenable situation—nobody wants
161420	163860	to travel to the center of a pandemic.
163860	167940	But soon, the untenable situation became worse.
167940	172380	On Wednesday, March 11th, television switched on to the American President sitting behind
172380	174640	his desk in the Oval Office.
174640	180360	A speech in this setting is reserved for only the most solemn occasions—only four such
180360	183880	addresses occurred in the entire 2010s decade.
183880	188720	The President laid out some steps in his administration's response to the virus—the most stunning
188720	194280	of which being, a complete ban on all foreign travelers from Europe.
194280	197080	That was unprecedented.
197080	202120	Europe and the US are two of the most culturally and economically linked regions in the world,
202120	207260	and never before would anyone even imagine anything even close to a complete travel ban
207260	208880	between the two.
208880	212640	The amount of individuals this would impact was astronomical.
212640	217080	The North Atlantic is home to one of the busiest flows of long-haul flights in the world.
217080	222760	More than 1,700 aircraft per day cross the Atlantic—many of those enormous wide-body
222760	223760	jets.
223760	227000	These are some of the most profitable flights for airlines out there.
227000	230720	To imagine that this would all just come to a stop was unthinkable.
230720	236040	Now, Delta, American, and United would join the big European three to have their demand
236040	238480	slashed by the virus.
238480	243660	All six of the world's largest airlines, by revenue, went into crisis mode.
243900	248540	Beyond just the transatlantic flying, intra-Europe and US domestic travel figures dropped off
248540	249620	a cliff.
249620	254180	As one example, United Airlines, the fourth largest airline in the world, issued a press
254180	259340	release announcing a 60% reduction in their flight capacity in April 2020.
259340	264060	Even with those drastic cuts, they predicted an average load factor—how full their planes
264060	267580	are—of 20-30%.
267580	270620	Since then, they've cut flights even further.
270620	275340	Almost every airline in Europe started experiencing net-negative bookings.
275340	279260	That means that they were refunding more bookings than they had coming in.
279260	285220	Some airlines, including Qantas, Virgin Australia, WestJet, and more, decided to cancel all but
285220	287100	their domestic flights.
287100	292660	Other airlines, including Lott, Brussels Airlines, and Austrian Airlines, decided to just completely
292660	296080	close down for a few weeks or months.
296080	299060	They would fly no flights at all.
299060	304700	Since its occurrence, 9-11 has been the defining crisis for the aviation industry.
304700	310400	Since civil aviation began, traffic numbers just grew and grew and grew until suddenly,
310400	313900	on a sunny September morning, that all stopped.
313900	318540	It was bad, and airlines did go bankrupt, but overall, the industry eventually made
318540	320500	it out the other end.
320500	325200	Less than a week after coronavirus became a pandemic, though, one thing became abundantly
325200	327940	clear to airlines—coronavirus.
327940	331680	To them, financially, was worse than 9-11.
331680	338060	This was the most severe drop-off in passenger demand in the history of aviation.
338060	341580	Airlines are no strangers to doing things that lose money.
341580	346780	There is perhaps no industry out there that so robustly embraces the idea of a loss leader
346780	348320	than aviation.
348320	353020	Airlines will go to great lengths to retain loyalty—both of individual travelers and
353020	354980	of their corporate contracts.
354980	359340	For example, airlines can and often do keep routes flying in the depths of winter, when
359340	363500	traffic is the lowest, in order to reliably present themselves as a go-to airline for
363500	364500	their customers.
364500	368820	If, say, there's a US-based company with significant amounts of travel to Barcelona,
368820	373040	they're only going to set up a corporate contract with an airline that can fly their
373040	374220	employees there year-round.
374220	379780	Therefore, American Airlines, for example, might fly there for 12 months a year even
379780	382220	if only eight of those turn a profit.
382660	386800	That's because, with the loss of corporate contracts, they might only turn a profit flying
386800	392140	to Barcelona five months a year, so overall yearly profit will be higher by taking a loss
392140	393800	four months a year.
393800	398460	The equation changes when nobody, including those corporate customers, wants to travel,
398460	399460	though.
399460	403300	Therefore, with the coronavirus reaching pandemic level in one of the lowest traffic periods
403300	407960	of the year, airlines quickly were able to make the decision to cut loss-leading long-haul
407960	409420	flights.
409420	411340	These cuts are deep.
411340	415820	The Lufthansa Group, for example, the seventh largest airline in the world by passengers,
415820	420320	is reducing its long-haul schedule to a sole flight from Zurich to Newark, then flights
420320	426140	from Frankfurt to São Paulo, Newark, Chicago, Montreal, Tokyo, Bangkok, and Johannesburg.
426140	431540	To think that this is what the seventh largest airline in the world in 2020 looks like is
431540	437220	unimaginable, but the situation at the world's largest airline, American Airlines, is even
437220	439000	more severe.
439000	442520	This is their long-haul network during the coronavirus.
442520	448700	They'll fly just Miami to London, Dallas to London, and Dallas to Tokyo.
448700	452600	This is a situation without a lot of good news.
452600	458060	Jobs will be lost, and airlines will go bankrupt, but there is plenty of hope that the industry
458060	459900	can survive.
459900	465260	While this fall will be far, airlines do have further to fall than after 9-11.
465260	471100	In 1999, United, American, and Delta achieved operating margins—the ratio of their earnings
471100	476660	to revenues—of 6.8, 6.5, and 12.7%, respectively.
476660	482640	In 2019, those margins were 9.9, 6.6, and 14.0%.
482640	487140	These are small differences, but a few percentage points can mean the difference between life
487140	489060	and death for an airline.
489060	493300	Another saving grace for airlines is the recent plummet in oil prices.
493300	497340	This is the byproduct of a price war going on between two of the world's largest oil
497340	500200	producers—Saudi Arabia and Russia.
500200	504560	The two countries have long worked together to limit output based on demand and therefore
504560	509600	more or less control oil prices, but, after Russia refused to reduce their output, Saudi
509600	514260	Arabia responded by slashing prices and increasing production in order to price Russia out of
514260	515260	the market.
515260	520560	Therefore, the same barrel of jet fuel that would have cost airlines $60 in February costs
520560	523000	only $40 in March 2020.
523000	528000	That's a significant discount on airlines' biggest cost and, if it were not for the biggest
528000	532460	drop in demand in the history of aviation, they would be celebrating a huge increase
532460	533780	in profits.
533780	538580	In the midst of the crisis, though, they're taking the small win of smaller losses.
538580	543640	The aviation industry, as a whole, never truly recovered from the effects of 9-11.
543640	547880	That's because recovery implies getting back to normal, and that's something that
547880	553120	never happened after 9-11, and certainly will never happen after coronavirus.
553120	558220	It's nearly impossible to predict what will happen in the aftermath of a situation never
558220	559760	seen before.
559760	564580	As we've seen already, and will continue to see, the response to extraordinary circumstances
564580	566480	is extraordinary measures.
566480	572200	Therefore, the industry will emerge from the other end something completely new and novel.
572200	577660	How deep the dip sinks will be determined by how high the curve soars, and that will
577660	583000	be determined by world governments, organizations, and more than all, how every individual out
583000	587220	there responds to COVID-19.
