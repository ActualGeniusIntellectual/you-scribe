4
00:00:10,040 --> 00:00:14,840
I need not tell you what happened in March, 2020.

5
00:00:14,840 --> 00:00:19,060
Whether you're watching this now or far in the future, that date will forever remain

6
00:00:19,060 --> 00:00:23,380
in people's minds as when the century's first pandemic emerged.

7
00:00:23,380 --> 00:00:27,560
It will remain in people's minds as when the era of social distancing and isolation

8
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:28,680
began.

9
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:32,880
It will remain in people's minds as when they got sick, or when a loved one got sick,

10
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:33,960
or worse.

11
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:38,600
In addition, though, for the millions of people worldwide working in the aviation industry,

12
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:44,640
March, 2020 will mark the date when they lost their jobs—when their company started turning

13
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:45,680
south.

14
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:48,580
It will mark the beginning of the end.

15
00:00:48,580 --> 00:00:54,160
There is perhaps no industry more severely impacted by COVID-19 than aviation.

16
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:59,660
As it is a brand new virus, in these early days, when there is no immunity or vaccines,

17
00:00:59,660 --> 00:01:05,260
the only way to stop or slow its spread is through physically isolating people.

18
00:01:05,260 --> 00:01:10,680
That is intrinsically in opposition to what aviation is—aviation works to bring people

19
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:11,680
together.

20
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:15,600
That meant that one of the first measures governments implemented to slow the spread

21
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:17,440
was to ban travel.

22
00:01:17,440 --> 00:01:22,200
When the virus first emerged, its transmission primarily occurred in China, with only isolated

23
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:25,760
cases elsewhere from those who had traveled from the epicenter.

24
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:29,960
For this issue, the solution was simple—ban travel from China.

25
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:34,280
A number of countries, notably including the US, barred foreigners who had recently been

26
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:39,080
in China from entering their borders and, in response to the sharp decline in demand,

27
00:01:39,080 --> 00:01:42,620
a number of airlines cancelled their flights to Greater China.

28
00:01:42,620 --> 00:01:47,140
The financial implications of this were limited, as few foreign airlines are significantly

29
00:01:47,140 --> 00:01:51,800
exposed to China, partly due to the strength of the Chinese airlines.

30
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:55,640
Most of those mainland Chinese airlines, meanwhile, are government-owned so they could

31
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:57,040
take the hit.

32
00:01:57,040 --> 00:02:01,600
Of course nearby Asian airlines like Scoot, Cathay Pacific, and ANA would struggle, but

33
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:05,280
the lockdown of China was more or less a weatherable hit.

34
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:08,420
But then, the virus spread.

35
00:02:08,420 --> 00:02:11,720
First to South Korea, so airlines cancelled flights to South Korea.

36
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:14,840
Then to Iran, so airlines cancelled flights to Iran.

37
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:17,700
Then to Italy, so airlines cancelled flights to Italy.

38
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:23,120
Then it seeped through Italy's porous borders to take hold of the entirety of Europe.

39
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:27,840
That was the moment when, to airlines, the situation became severe.

40
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:33,020
Europe is home to, by revenue, three of the world's six largest airlines—the Lufthansa

41
00:02:33,020 --> 00:02:36,140
Group, Air France KLM, and IAG.

42
00:02:36,140 --> 00:02:41,420
To have a virus devastating their home territory was an untenable situation—nobody wants

43
00:02:41,420 --> 00:02:43,860
to travel to the center of a pandemic.

44
00:02:43,860 --> 00:02:47,940
But soon, the untenable situation became worse.

45
00:02:47,940 --> 00:02:52,380
On Wednesday, March 11th, television switched on to the American President sitting behind

46
00:02:52,380 --> 00:02:54,640
his desk in the Oval Office.

47
00:02:54,640 --> 00:03:00,360
A speech in this setting is reserved for only the most solemn occasions—only four such

48
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:03,880
addresses occurred in the entire 2010s decade.

49
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:08,720
The President laid out some steps in his administration's response to the virus—the most stunning

50
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:14,280
of which being, a complete ban on all foreign travelers from Europe.

51
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:17,080
That was unprecedented.

52
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:22,120
Europe and the US are two of the most culturally and economically linked regions in the world,

53
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:27,260
and never before would anyone even imagine anything even close to a complete travel ban

54
00:03:27,260 --> 00:03:28,880
between the two.

55
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:32,640
The amount of individuals this would impact was astronomical.

56
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:37,080
The North Atlantic is home to one of the busiest flows of long-haul flights in the world.

57
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:42,760
More than 1,700 aircraft per day cross the Atlantic—many of those enormous wide-body

58
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:43,760
jets.

59
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:47,000
These are some of the most profitable flights for airlines out there.

60
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:50,720
To imagine that this would all just come to a stop was unthinkable.

61
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:56,040
Now, Delta, American, and United would join the big European three to have their demand

62
00:03:56,040 --> 00:03:58,480
slashed by the virus.

63
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:03,660
All six of the world's largest airlines, by revenue, went into crisis mode.

64
00:04:03,900 --> 00:04:08,540
Beyond just the transatlantic flying, intra-Europe and US domestic travel figures dropped off

65
00:04:08,540 --> 00:04:09,620
a cliff.

66
00:04:09,620 --> 00:04:14,180
As one example, United Airlines, the fourth largest airline in the world, issued a press

67
00:04:14,180 --> 00:04:19,340
release announcing a 60% reduction in their flight capacity in April 2020.

68
00:04:19,340 --> 00:04:24,060
Even with those drastic cuts, they predicted an average load factor—how full their planes

69
00:04:24,060 --> 00:04:27,580
are—of 20-30%.

70
00:04:27,580 --> 00:04:30,620
Since then, they've cut flights even further.

71
00:04:30,620 --> 00:04:35,340
Almost every airline in Europe started experiencing net-negative bookings.

72
00:04:35,340 --> 00:04:39,260
That means that they were refunding more bookings than they had coming in.

73
00:04:39,260 --> 00:04:45,220
Some airlines, including Qantas, Virgin Australia, WestJet, and more, decided to cancel all but

74
00:04:45,220 --> 00:04:47,100
their domestic flights.

75
00:04:47,100 --> 00:04:52,660
Other airlines, including Lott, Brussels Airlines, and Austrian Airlines, decided to just completely

76
00:04:52,660 --> 00:04:56,080
close down for a few weeks or months.

77
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:59,060
They would fly no flights at all.

78
00:04:59,060 --> 00:05:04,700
Since its occurrence, 9-11 has been the defining crisis for the aviation industry.

79
00:05:04,700 --> 00:05:10,400
Since civil aviation began, traffic numbers just grew and grew and grew until suddenly,

80
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:13,900
on a sunny September morning, that all stopped.

81
00:05:13,900 --> 00:05:18,540
It was bad, and airlines did go bankrupt, but overall, the industry eventually made

82
00:05:18,540 --> 00:05:20,500
it out the other end.

83
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:25,200
Less than a week after coronavirus became a pandemic, though, one thing became abundantly

84
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:27,940
clear to airlines—coronavirus.

85
00:05:27,940 --> 00:05:31,680
To them, financially, was worse than 9-11.

86
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:38,060
This was the most severe drop-off in passenger demand in the history of aviation.

87
00:05:38,060 --> 00:05:41,580
Airlines are no strangers to doing things that lose money.

88
00:05:41,580 --> 00:05:46,780
There is perhaps no industry out there that so robustly embraces the idea of a loss leader

89
00:05:46,780 --> 00:05:48,320
than aviation.

90
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:53,020
Airlines will go to great lengths to retain loyalty—both of individual travelers and

91
00:05:53,020 --> 00:05:54,980
of their corporate contracts.

92
00:05:54,980 --> 00:05:59,340
For example, airlines can and often do keep routes flying in the depths of winter, when

93
00:05:59,340 --> 00:06:03,500
traffic is the lowest, in order to reliably present themselves as a go-to airline for

94
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:04,500
their customers.

95
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:08,820
If, say, there's a US-based company with significant amounts of travel to Barcelona,

96
00:06:08,820 --> 00:06:13,040
they're only going to set up a corporate contract with an airline that can fly their

97
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:14,220
employees there year-round.

98
00:06:14,220 --> 00:06:19,780
Therefore, American Airlines, for example, might fly there for 12 months a year even

99
00:06:19,780 --> 00:06:22,220
if only eight of those turn a profit.

100
00:06:22,660 --> 00:06:26,800
That's because, with the loss of corporate contracts, they might only turn a profit flying

101
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:32,140
to Barcelona five months a year, so overall yearly profit will be higher by taking a loss

102
00:06:32,140 --> 00:06:33,800
four months a year.

103
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:38,460
The equation changes when nobody, including those corporate customers, wants to travel,

104
00:06:38,460 --> 00:06:39,460
though.

105
00:06:39,460 --> 00:06:43,300
Therefore, with the coronavirus reaching pandemic level in one of the lowest traffic periods

106
00:06:43,300 --> 00:06:47,960
of the year, airlines quickly were able to make the decision to cut loss-leading long-haul

107
00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:49,420
flights.

108
00:06:49,420 --> 00:06:51,340
These cuts are deep.

109
00:06:51,340 --> 00:06:55,820
The Lufthansa Group, for example, the seventh largest airline in the world by passengers,

110
00:06:55,820 --> 00:07:00,320
is reducing its long-haul schedule to a sole flight from Zurich to Newark, then flights

111
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:06,140
from Frankfurt to São Paulo, Newark, Chicago, Montreal, Tokyo, Bangkok, and Johannesburg.

112
00:07:06,140 --> 00:07:11,540
To think that this is what the seventh largest airline in the world in 2020 looks like is

113
00:07:11,540 --> 00:07:17,220
unimaginable, but the situation at the world's largest airline, American Airlines, is even

114
00:07:17,220 --> 00:07:19,000
more severe.

115
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:22,520
This is their long-haul network during the coronavirus.

116
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:28,700
They'll fly just Miami to London, Dallas to London, and Dallas to Tokyo.

117
00:07:28,700 --> 00:07:32,600
This is a situation without a lot of good news.

118
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:38,060
Jobs will be lost, and airlines will go bankrupt, but there is plenty of hope that the industry

119
00:07:38,060 --> 00:07:39,900
can survive.

120
00:07:39,900 --> 00:07:45,260
While this fall will be far, airlines do have further to fall than after 9-11.

121
00:07:45,260 --> 00:07:51,100
In 1999, United, American, and Delta achieved operating margins—the ratio of their earnings

122
00:07:51,100 --> 00:07:56,660
to revenues—of 6.8, 6.5, and 12.7%, respectively.

123
00:07:56,660 --> 00:08:02,640
In 2019, those margins were 9.9, 6.6, and 14.0%.

124
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:07,140
These are small differences, but a few percentage points can mean the difference between life

125
00:08:07,140 --> 00:08:09,060
and death for an airline.

126
00:08:09,060 --> 00:08:13,300
Another saving grace for airlines is the recent plummet in oil prices.

127
00:08:13,300 --> 00:08:17,340
This is the byproduct of a price war going on between two of the world's largest oil

128
00:08:17,340 --> 00:08:20,200
producers—Saudi Arabia and Russia.

129
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:24,560
The two countries have long worked together to limit output based on demand and therefore

130
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:29,600
more or less control oil prices, but, after Russia refused to reduce their output, Saudi

131
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:34,260
Arabia responded by slashing prices and increasing production in order to price Russia out of

132
00:08:34,260 --> 00:08:35,260
the market.

133
00:08:35,260 --> 00:08:40,560
Therefore, the same barrel of jet fuel that would have cost airlines $60 in February costs

134
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:43,000
only $40 in March 2020.

135
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:48,000
That's a significant discount on airlines' biggest cost and, if it were not for the biggest

136
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:52,460
drop in demand in the history of aviation, they would be celebrating a huge increase

137
00:08:52,460 --> 00:08:53,780
in profits.

138
00:08:53,780 --> 00:08:58,580
In the midst of the crisis, though, they're taking the small win of smaller losses.

139
00:08:58,580 --> 00:09:03,640
The aviation industry, as a whole, never truly recovered from the effects of 9-11.

140
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:07,880
That's because recovery implies getting back to normal, and that's something that

141
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:13,120
never happened after 9-11, and certainly will never happen after coronavirus.

142
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:18,220
It's nearly impossible to predict what will happen in the aftermath of a situation never

143
00:09:18,220 --> 00:09:19,760
seen before.

144
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:24,580
As we've seen already, and will continue to see, the response to extraordinary circumstances

145
00:09:24,580 --> 00:09:26,480
is extraordinary measures.

146
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:32,200
Therefore, the industry will emerge from the other end something completely new and novel.

147
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:37,660
How deep the dip sinks will be determined by how high the curve soars, and that will

148
00:09:37,660 --> 00:09:43,000
be determined by world governments, organizations, and more than all, how every individual out

149
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:47,220
there responds to COVID-19.

150
00:09:47,220 --> 00:09:51,860
For those of you subscribed to Nebula, a brand new original called Money, made by the fantastic

151
00:09:51,860 --> 00:09:54,300
YouTuber Tom Scott, just released.

152
00:09:54,300 --> 00:09:59,060
I, along with Sophie Ward, Mike Boyd, Mia Mulder, and Rowan Francis, were subjected

153
00:09:59,060 --> 00:10:02,740
to five of Tom's games in order to win real money.

154
00:10:02,740 --> 00:10:07,260
