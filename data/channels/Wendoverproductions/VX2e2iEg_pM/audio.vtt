00:10.040 --> 00:14.840
I need not tell you what happened in March, 2020.

00:14.840 --> 00:19.060
Whether you're watching this now or far in the future, that date will forever remain

00:19.060 --> 00:23.380
in people's minds as when the century's first pandemic emerged.

00:23.380 --> 00:27.560
It will remain in people's minds as when the era of social distancing and isolation

00:27.560 --> 00:28.680
began.

00:28.680 --> 00:32.880
It will remain in people's minds as when they got sick, or when a loved one got sick,

00:32.880 --> 00:33.960
or worse.

00:33.960 --> 00:38.600
In addition, though, for the millions of people worldwide working in the aviation industry,

00:38.600 --> 00:44.640
March, 2020 will mark the date when they lost their jobs—when their company started turning

00:44.640 --> 00:45.680
south.

00:45.680 --> 00:48.580
It will mark the beginning of the end.

00:48.580 --> 00:54.160
There is perhaps no industry more severely impacted by COVID-19 than aviation.

00:54.160 --> 00:59.660
As it is a brand new virus, in these early days, when there is no immunity or vaccines,

00:59.660 --> 01:05.260
the only way to stop or slow its spread is through physically isolating people.

01:05.260 --> 01:10.680
That is intrinsically in opposition to what aviation is—aviation works to bring people

01:10.680 --> 01:11.680
together.

01:11.680 --> 01:15.600
That meant that one of the first measures governments implemented to slow the spread

01:15.600 --> 01:17.440
was to ban travel.

01:17.440 --> 01:22.200
When the virus first emerged, its transmission primarily occurred in China, with only isolated

01:22.200 --> 01:25.760
cases elsewhere from those who had traveled from the epicenter.

01:25.760 --> 01:29.960
For this issue, the solution was simple—ban travel from China.

01:29.960 --> 01:34.280
A number of countries, notably including the US, barred foreigners who had recently been

01:34.280 --> 01:39.080
in China from entering their borders and, in response to the sharp decline in demand,

01:39.080 --> 01:42.620
a number of airlines cancelled their flights to Greater China.

01:42.620 --> 01:47.140
The financial implications of this were limited, as few foreign airlines are significantly

01:47.140 --> 01:51.800
exposed to China, partly due to the strength of the Chinese airlines.

01:51.800 --> 01:55.640
Most of those mainland Chinese airlines, meanwhile, are government-owned so they could

01:55.640 --> 01:57.040
take the hit.

01:57.040 --> 02:01.600
Of course nearby Asian airlines like Scoot, Cathay Pacific, and ANA would struggle, but

02:01.600 --> 02:05.280
the lockdown of China was more or less a weatherable hit.

02:05.280 --> 02:08.420
But then, the virus spread.

02:08.420 --> 02:11.720
First to South Korea, so airlines cancelled flights to South Korea.

02:11.720 --> 02:14.840
Then to Iran, so airlines cancelled flights to Iran.

02:14.840 --> 02:17.700
Then to Italy, so airlines cancelled flights to Italy.

02:17.920 --> 02:23.120
Then it seeped through Italy's porous borders to take hold of the entirety of Europe.

02:23.120 --> 02:27.840
That was the moment when, to airlines, the situation became severe.

02:27.840 --> 02:33.020
Europe is home to, by revenue, three of the world's six largest airlines—the Lufthansa

02:33.020 --> 02:36.140
Group, Air France KLM, and IAG.

02:36.140 --> 02:41.420
To have a virus devastating their home territory was an untenable situation—nobody wants

02:41.420 --> 02:43.860
to travel to the center of a pandemic.

02:43.860 --> 02:47.940
But soon, the untenable situation became worse.

02:47.940 --> 02:52.380
On Wednesday, March 11th, television switched on to the American President sitting behind

02:52.380 --> 02:54.640
his desk in the Oval Office.

02:54.640 --> 03:00.360
A speech in this setting is reserved for only the most solemn occasions—only four such

03:00.360 --> 03:03.880
addresses occurred in the entire 2010s decade.

03:03.880 --> 03:08.720
The President laid out some steps in his administration's response to the virus—the most stunning

03:08.720 --> 03:14.280
of which being, a complete ban on all foreign travelers from Europe.

03:14.280 --> 03:17.080
That was unprecedented.

03:17.080 --> 03:22.120
Europe and the US are two of the most culturally and economically linked regions in the world,

03:22.120 --> 03:27.260
and never before would anyone even imagine anything even close to a complete travel ban

03:27.260 --> 03:28.880
between the two.

03:28.880 --> 03:32.640
The amount of individuals this would impact was astronomical.

03:32.640 --> 03:37.080
The North Atlantic is home to one of the busiest flows of long-haul flights in the world.

03:37.080 --> 03:42.760
More than 1,700 aircraft per day cross the Atlantic—many of those enormous wide-body

03:42.760 --> 03:43.760
jets.

03:43.760 --> 03:47.000
These are some of the most profitable flights for airlines out there.

03:47.000 --> 03:50.720
To imagine that this would all just come to a stop was unthinkable.

03:50.720 --> 03:56.040
Now, Delta, American, and United would join the big European three to have their demand

03:56.040 --> 03:58.480
slashed by the virus.

03:58.480 --> 04:03.660
All six of the world's largest airlines, by revenue, went into crisis mode.

04:03.900 --> 04:08.540
Beyond just the transatlantic flying, intra-Europe and US domestic travel figures dropped off

04:08.540 --> 04:09.620
a cliff.

04:09.620 --> 04:14.180
As one example, United Airlines, the fourth largest airline in the world, issued a press

04:14.180 --> 04:19.340
release announcing a 60% reduction in their flight capacity in April 2020.

04:19.340 --> 04:24.060
Even with those drastic cuts, they predicted an average load factor—how full their planes

04:24.060 --> 04:27.580
are—of 20-30%.

04:27.580 --> 04:30.620
Since then, they've cut flights even further.

04:30.620 --> 04:35.340
Almost every airline in Europe started experiencing net-negative bookings.

04:35.340 --> 04:39.260
That means that they were refunding more bookings than they had coming in.

04:39.260 --> 04:45.220
Some airlines, including Qantas, Virgin Australia, WestJet, and more, decided to cancel all but

04:45.220 --> 04:47.100
their domestic flights.

04:47.100 --> 04:52.660
Other airlines, including Lott, Brussels Airlines, and Austrian Airlines, decided to just completely

04:52.660 --> 04:56.080
close down for a few weeks or months.

04:56.080 --> 04:59.060
They would fly no flights at all.

04:59.060 --> 05:04.700
Since its occurrence, 9-11 has been the defining crisis for the aviation industry.

05:04.700 --> 05:10.400
Since civil aviation began, traffic numbers just grew and grew and grew until suddenly,

05:10.400 --> 05:13.900
on a sunny September morning, that all stopped.

05:13.900 --> 05:18.540
It was bad, and airlines did go bankrupt, but overall, the industry eventually made

05:18.540 --> 05:20.500
it out the other end.

05:20.500 --> 05:25.200
Less than a week after coronavirus became a pandemic, though, one thing became abundantly

05:25.200 --> 05:27.940
clear to airlines—coronavirus.

05:27.940 --> 05:31.680
To them, financially, was worse than 9-11.

05:31.680 --> 05:38.060
This was the most severe drop-off in passenger demand in the history of aviation.

05:38.060 --> 05:41.580
Airlines are no strangers to doing things that lose money.

05:41.580 --> 05:46.780
There is perhaps no industry out there that so robustly embraces the idea of a loss leader

05:46.780 --> 05:48.320
than aviation.

05:48.320 --> 05:53.020
Airlines will go to great lengths to retain loyalty—both of individual travelers and

05:53.020 --> 05:54.980
of their corporate contracts.

05:54.980 --> 05:59.340
For example, airlines can and often do keep routes flying in the depths of winter, when

05:59.340 --> 06:03.500
traffic is the lowest, in order to reliably present themselves as a go-to airline for

06:03.500 --> 06:04.500
their customers.

06:04.500 --> 06:08.820
If, say, there's a US-based company with significant amounts of travel to Barcelona,

06:08.820 --> 06:13.040
they're only going to set up a corporate contract with an airline that can fly their

06:13.040 --> 06:14.220
employees there year-round.

06:14.220 --> 06:19.780
Therefore, American Airlines, for example, might fly there for 12 months a year even

06:19.780 --> 06:22.220
if only eight of those turn a profit.

06:22.660 --> 06:26.800
That's because, with the loss of corporate contracts, they might only turn a profit flying

06:26.800 --> 06:32.140
to Barcelona five months a year, so overall yearly profit will be higher by taking a loss

06:32.140 --> 06:33.800
four months a year.

06:33.800 --> 06:38.460
The equation changes when nobody, including those corporate customers, wants to travel,

06:38.460 --> 06:39.460
though.

06:39.460 --> 06:43.300
Therefore, with the coronavirus reaching pandemic level in one of the lowest traffic periods

06:43.300 --> 06:47.960
of the year, airlines quickly were able to make the decision to cut loss-leading long-haul

06:47.960 --> 06:49.420
flights.

06:49.420 --> 06:51.340
These cuts are deep.

06:51.340 --> 06:55.820
The Lufthansa Group, for example, the seventh largest airline in the world by passengers,

06:55.820 --> 07:00.320
is reducing its long-haul schedule to a sole flight from Zurich to Newark, then flights

07:00.320 --> 07:06.140
from Frankfurt to São Paulo, Newark, Chicago, Montreal, Tokyo, Bangkok, and Johannesburg.

07:06.140 --> 07:11.540
To think that this is what the seventh largest airline in the world in 2020 looks like is

07:11.540 --> 07:17.220
unimaginable, but the situation at the world's largest airline, American Airlines, is even

07:17.220 --> 07:19.000
more severe.

07:19.000 --> 07:22.520
This is their long-haul network during the coronavirus.

07:22.520 --> 07:28.700
They'll fly just Miami to London, Dallas to London, and Dallas to Tokyo.

07:28.700 --> 07:32.600
This is a situation without a lot of good news.

07:32.600 --> 07:38.060
Jobs will be lost, and airlines will go bankrupt, but there is plenty of hope that the industry

07:38.060 --> 07:39.900
can survive.

07:39.900 --> 07:45.260
While this fall will be far, airlines do have further to fall than after 9-11.

07:45.260 --> 07:51.100
In 1999, United, American, and Delta achieved operating margins—the ratio of their earnings

07:51.100 --> 07:56.660
to revenues—of 6.8, 6.5, and 12.7%, respectively.

07:56.660 --> 08:02.640
In 2019, those margins were 9.9, 6.6, and 14.0%.

08:02.640 --> 08:07.140
These are small differences, but a few percentage points can mean the difference between life

08:07.140 --> 08:09.060
and death for an airline.

08:09.060 --> 08:13.300
Another saving grace for airlines is the recent plummet in oil prices.

08:13.300 --> 08:17.340
This is the byproduct of a price war going on between two of the world's largest oil

08:17.340 --> 08:20.200
producers—Saudi Arabia and Russia.

08:20.200 --> 08:24.560
The two countries have long worked together to limit output based on demand and therefore

08:24.560 --> 08:29.600
more or less control oil prices, but, after Russia refused to reduce their output, Saudi

08:29.600 --> 08:34.260
Arabia responded by slashing prices and increasing production in order to price Russia out of

08:34.260 --> 08:35.260
the market.

08:35.260 --> 08:40.560
Therefore, the same barrel of jet fuel that would have cost airlines $60 in February costs

08:40.560 --> 08:43.000
only $40 in March 2020.

08:43.000 --> 08:48.000
That's a significant discount on airlines' biggest cost and, if it were not for the biggest

08:48.000 --> 08:52.460
drop in demand in the history of aviation, they would be celebrating a huge increase

08:52.460 --> 08:53.780
in profits.

08:53.780 --> 08:58.580
In the midst of the crisis, though, they're taking the small win of smaller losses.

08:58.580 --> 09:03.640
The aviation industry, as a whole, never truly recovered from the effects of 9-11.

09:03.640 --> 09:07.880
That's because recovery implies getting back to normal, and that's something that

09:07.880 --> 09:13.120
never happened after 9-11, and certainly will never happen after coronavirus.

09:13.120 --> 09:18.220
It's nearly impossible to predict what will happen in the aftermath of a situation never

09:18.220 --> 09:19.760
seen before.

09:19.760 --> 09:24.580
As we've seen already, and will continue to see, the response to extraordinary circumstances

09:24.580 --> 09:26.480
is extraordinary measures.

09:26.480 --> 09:32.200
Therefore, the industry will emerge from the other end something completely new and novel.

09:32.200 --> 09:37.660
How deep the dip sinks will be determined by how high the curve soars, and that will

09:37.660 --> 09:43.000
be determined by world governments, organizations, and more than all, how every individual out

09:43.000 --> 09:47.220
there responds to COVID-19.

09:47.220 --> 09:51.860
For those of you subscribed to Nebula, a brand new original called Money, made by the fantastic
