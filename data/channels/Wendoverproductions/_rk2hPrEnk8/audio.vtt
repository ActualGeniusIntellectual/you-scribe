00:00.000 --> 00:05.300
About a year ago, Andy George from the channel How to Make Everything released a video called

00:05.300 --> 00:08.940
How to Make a $1500 Sandwich in Only 6 Months.

00:08.940 --> 00:13.100
I made a chicken sandwich completely from scratch, which cost $1500 in six months of

00:13.100 --> 00:14.380
my life.

00:14.380 --> 00:15.780
The video was hugely successful.

00:15.780 --> 00:17.660
It got millions of views.

00:17.660 --> 00:21.220
Then, a few weeks ago, Andy came to me with a question.

00:21.220 --> 00:24.900
Obviously I didn't use the most efficient method of making my sandwich, but why is there

00:24.900 --> 00:29.160
such a huge gap in price between the sandwich I made for $1500 and one you can just buy

00:29.160 --> 00:31.540
at a store for much less?

00:31.540 --> 00:36.320
My nearest grocery store sells pre-made chicken sandwiches for two pounds—about two and

00:36.320 --> 00:37.820
a half US dollars.

00:37.820 --> 00:41.300
That's 600 times cheaper than Andy's sandwich.

00:41.300 --> 00:46.540
The economic principle that really makes the modern commercial world go round is economies

00:46.540 --> 00:47.700
of scale.

00:47.700 --> 00:52.160
You might remember from history class that an important step in the development of humanity

00:52.160 --> 00:55.460
was the beginning of specialization of labor.

00:55.460 --> 01:00.000
That was the point when advancements in technology were far enough along that the amount of food

01:00.000 --> 01:04.840
one person could produce was higher than the amount one person needed to survive.

01:04.840 --> 01:10.160
Since there was a surplus, some people could go and do other things, like science, research,

01:10.160 --> 01:12.440
writing, and even production.

01:12.440 --> 01:16.640
This also helped spur the development of the first real cities since everyone didn't

01:16.640 --> 01:18.840
have to live on farms.

01:18.840 --> 01:22.900
Specialization of labor was in a way the very beginning of the use of economies of scale

01:22.900 --> 01:27.360
because instead of everyone growing and making everything they needed, different people did

01:27.360 --> 01:31.240
what they did best and exchanged goods to get what they needed.

01:31.240 --> 01:36.940
Fast forward almost 10,000 years and the world is almost entirely specialized.

01:36.940 --> 01:41.280
Individuals almost never make things for themselves, except for Andy George.

01:41.280 --> 01:45.500
I challenged myself to see if I could as an individual make something as basic as a sandwich

01:45.500 --> 01:46.500
entirely by myself.

01:46.500 --> 01:50.640
I grew all my own vegetables, harvested and ground my own wheat to make bread, killed

01:50.640 --> 01:54.860
and butchered my own chicken, and even flew all the way from Minneapolis to LA to collect

01:54.860 --> 01:57.060
ocean water to boil down for salt.

01:57.060 --> 01:59.500
The salt is what we're going to focus on.

01:59.500 --> 02:04.220
The reason is because Andy's salt production process was almost identical to that of a

02:04.220 --> 02:05.460
larger firm.

02:05.460 --> 02:10.700
He had to gather raw materials, process it into a product, then transport it to a final

02:10.700 --> 02:11.700
market.

02:11.700 --> 02:16.580
Those three steps have been optimized in our modern world to yield insane cost reductions.

02:16.580 --> 02:23.880
In order to make my salt, I spent $298.88 on a plane ticket, $57 to rent a boat, and

02:23.880 --> 02:27.160
$6.41 for a five gallon jug.

02:27.160 --> 02:29.680
All just to gather the few ounces of salt I needed.

02:29.680 --> 02:34.000
He only needed a small amount, but for the same price, he could have gathered more than

02:34.000 --> 02:35.520
a pound's worth.

02:35.520 --> 02:39.480
For his six ounces of salt, Andy paid $362.40.

02:39.480 --> 02:45.680
That's $52 per ounce, more than triple the cost of silver.

02:45.680 --> 02:50.780
Each gallon of seawater yields about 4.5 ounces of salt when evaporated, so his five

02:50.780 --> 02:57.140
gallon jug could have carried enough water to make 22.5 ounces of salt or 1.4 pounds.

02:57.140 --> 03:03.180
At that production rate, the cost per ounce is $16, but we can make it even cheaper—we

03:03.180 --> 03:05.980
just need more five gallon jugs.

03:05.980 --> 03:13.700
If we buy, say, nine more five gallon jugs at $6.41 each, our total cost would be $419.98,

03:13.700 --> 03:17.600
but we could make 14 pounds of salt.

03:17.600 --> 03:25.800
That brings the cost down to $1.87 per ounce, but we can keep scaling this up to an extent.

03:25.800 --> 03:30.920
Andy's method of transport was flying and at that base rate his total cargo capacity

03:30.920 --> 03:33.880
was only the capacity of his carry-on bag.

03:33.880 --> 03:39.880
The largest carry-on bags have a capacity of 45 liters or 11.8 gallons.

03:39.880 --> 03:45.060
One gallon of salt weighs 18.1 pounds, so assuming nobody ever checks the bag, Andy

03:45.060 --> 03:48.980
could have carried 213.6 pounds of salt.

03:48.980 --> 03:55.060
To produce that much, Andy would have needed 153 five gallon jugs and the boat he was on

03:55.060 --> 03:59.700
could have only carried about 10, so he would have needed to rent 15 more.

03:59.700 --> 04:05.640
So if we add together the plane ticket, the 153 gallon jugs, and the 16 boat rentals,

04:05.640 --> 04:10.740
we get a total price of $2,191.58.

04:10.740 --> 04:15.660
A lot more, but it's worth it because at this production rate, the salt only costs

04:15.660 --> 04:19.840
64 cents per ounce, but we can keep scaling.

04:19.840 --> 04:25.460
The average rate to hire a Los Angeles based 40 foot semi-truck is $2 per mile.

04:25.460 --> 04:31.380
To drive the 1,912 miles from Los Angeles, California to Minneapolis, Minnesota, it would

04:31.380 --> 04:35.720
therefore cost $3,824.

04:35.720 --> 04:46.480
The usable capacity for these trucks is 2,395 cubic feet or 17,916 liquid gallons or 325,000

04:46.480 --> 04:47.480
pounds worth of salt.

04:47.480 --> 04:53.240
Sounds great, but the US only allows a total gross weight of 80,000 pounds on the road

04:53.240 --> 04:57.680
and that has to include the weight of the truck itself so the actual transport capacity

04:57.680 --> 05:00.680
is only about 40,000 pounds.

05:00.680 --> 05:05.960
Salt is just so dense that we can't load a truck to its full volume capacity.

05:05.960 --> 05:12.640
So we'll just produce 40,000 pounds of salt and for that we'd need 2,857 boat rentals

05:12.640 --> 05:17.120
and 28,571 five gallon jugs.

05:17.120 --> 05:21.640
For the sake of explanation, we'll pretend that we can't reuse the five gallon jugs.

05:21.640 --> 05:32.040
Those boat rentals would total up to $162,849 and the jugs would add up to $183,141.

05:32.040 --> 05:37.280
So, including the transport cost by truck, producing 40,000 pounds of salt would cost

05:37.280 --> 05:39.280
$349,814.

05:39.280 --> 05:44.620
That's now a cost of $0.54 per ounce.

05:44.620 --> 05:49.120
As you can see, as you get into higher and higher levels of production, the advantage

05:49.120 --> 05:51.640
of producing more grows smaller.

05:51.640 --> 05:57.720
It was 25 times cheaper to produce 214 pounds of salt than to produce 1.4 pounds of salt

05:57.720 --> 06:03.660
on a 152 times increase in production, but increasing the production from 214 pounds

06:03.660 --> 06:11.200
to 40,000 pounds—a 314 times increase—only decreases the price by 1.19 times.

06:11.200 --> 06:14.040
Let's shake up the production process.

06:14.040 --> 06:18.600
Instead of boiling the seawater down to salt in Los Angeles and transporting it to Minneapolis,

06:18.600 --> 06:23.520
let's say that Andy transported the seawater to Minneapolis then boiled it down.

06:23.520 --> 06:25.000
What would it cost then?

06:25.000 --> 06:30.760
Well, seawater weighs about 8.6 pounds per gallon and once again, we can only carry about

06:30.760 --> 06:35.260
40,000 pounds or 4,651 gallons.

06:35.260 --> 06:47.720
This will cost $3,824 for the truck, $5,968 for 931 five gallon jugs, $5,358 for 94 boat

06:47.720 --> 06:53.700
rentals, and in the end will only yield 1,308 pounds of salt.

06:53.700 --> 06:58.640
To make these 1,308 pounds, we spent 60 cents per ounce.

06:58.640 --> 07:02.600
A difference of 6 cents per gallon may not seem like a big deal, but once you get to

07:02.600 --> 07:10.760
the scale of producing, say, 100,000 pounds of salt, those 6 cents add up to $96,000—more

07:10.760 --> 07:14.360
than the price of a Tesla Model S.

07:14.360 --> 07:18.040
This demonstrates a very important principle in manufacturing.

07:18.040 --> 07:23.080
There are essentially two types of products—weight losing and weight gaining.

07:23.080 --> 07:26.720
Salt is one of the greatest examples of a weight losing product.

07:26.720 --> 07:32.400
You put in a lot of raw materials, in this case seawater, to make a little product.

07:32.400 --> 07:36.440
Obviously it doesn't make sense to ship the raw seawater cross country when you can

07:36.440 --> 07:39.000
just boil it down in Los Angeles.

07:39.000 --> 07:43.480
This is why processing plants for almost all weight losing products will be located near

07:43.480 --> 07:45.040
the source.

07:45.040 --> 07:47.640
The other type of product is weight gaining.

07:47.640 --> 07:53.280
You take a small amount of raw material and make it into something much heavier or larger.

07:53.280 --> 07:55.980
A great example of this is Coca-Cola.

07:55.980 --> 08:01.240
They have more than 900 bottling plants worldwide just so they can lower costs.

08:01.240 --> 08:06.360
If transport was not a factor at all, they could achieve lower costs by having one single

08:06.360 --> 08:07.360
mega-factoring.

08:07.360 --> 08:12.140
But once their soda is made, they still have to get it to the end consumer.

08:12.140 --> 08:16.340
The cost of transport is closely linked to weight so since they just take a small amount

08:16.340 --> 08:21.540
of flavors and ingredients and add it to water—something available almost anywhere—it makes sense

08:21.540 --> 08:24.540
to produce their product near the end consumer.

08:24.540 --> 08:30.180
Overall, we achieved a 92-fold reduction in cost of salt by using the principles of mass

08:30.180 --> 08:31.340
production.

08:31.340 --> 08:36.140
Every single ingredient Andy George used to make his $1,500 sandwich could have benefited

08:36.140 --> 08:38.520
from the principles of mass production.

08:38.520 --> 08:40.320
We also could have gone even further.

08:40.320 --> 08:43.520
We could have rented a bigger boat, used bigger containers.

08:43.520 --> 08:46.880
There were plenty of ways we could have driven down prices even more.

08:46.880 --> 08:52.240
But these type of cost reductions make the difference in our modern world between a $1,500

08:52.240 --> 08:54.860
and a $5 chicken sandwich.

08:54.860 --> 08:57.400
