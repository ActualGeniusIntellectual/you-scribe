0	5300	About a year ago, Andy George from the channel How to Make Everything released a video called
5300	8940	How to Make a $1500 Sandwich in Only 6 Months.
8940	13100	I made a chicken sandwich completely from scratch, which cost $1500 in six months of
13100	14380	my life.
14380	15780	The video was hugely successful.
15780	17660	It got millions of views.
17660	21220	Then, a few weeks ago, Andy came to me with a question.
21220	24900	Obviously I didn't use the most efficient method of making my sandwich, but why is there
24900	29160	such a huge gap in price between the sandwich I made for $1500 and one you can just buy
29160	31540	at a store for much less?
31540	36320	My nearest grocery store sells pre-made chicken sandwiches for two pounds—about two and
36320	37820	a half US dollars.
37820	41300	That's 600 times cheaper than Andy's sandwich.
41300	46540	The economic principle that really makes the modern commercial world go round is economies
46540	47700	of scale.
47700	52160	You might remember from history class that an important step in the development of humanity
52160	55460	was the beginning of specialization of labor.
55460	60000	That was the point when advancements in technology were far enough along that the amount of food
60000	64840	one person could produce was higher than the amount one person needed to survive.
64840	70160	Since there was a surplus, some people could go and do other things, like science, research,
70160	72440	writing, and even production.
72440	76640	This also helped spur the development of the first real cities since everyone didn't
76640	78840	have to live on farms.
78840	82900	Specialization of labor was in a way the very beginning of the use of economies of scale
82900	87360	because instead of everyone growing and making everything they needed, different people did
87360	91240	what they did best and exchanged goods to get what they needed.
91240	96940	Fast forward almost 10,000 years and the world is almost entirely specialized.
96940	101280	Individuals almost never make things for themselves, except for Andy George.
101280	105500	I challenged myself to see if I could as an individual make something as basic as a sandwich
105500	106500	entirely by myself.
106500	110640	I grew all my own vegetables, harvested and ground my own wheat to make bread, killed
110640	114860	and butchered my own chicken, and even flew all the way from Minneapolis to LA to collect
114860	117060	ocean water to boil down for salt.
117060	119500	The salt is what we're going to focus on.
119500	124220	The reason is because Andy's salt production process was almost identical to that of a
124220	125460	larger firm.
125460	130700	He had to gather raw materials, process it into a product, then transport it to a final
130700	131700	market.
131700	136580	Those three steps have been optimized in our modern world to yield insane cost reductions.
136580	143880	In order to make my salt, I spent $298.88 on a plane ticket, $57 to rent a boat, and
143880	147160	$6.41 for a five gallon jug.
147160	149680	All just to gather the few ounces of salt I needed.
149680	154000	He only needed a small amount, but for the same price, he could have gathered more than
154000	155520	a pound's worth.
155520	159480	For his six ounces of salt, Andy paid $362.40.
159480	165680	That's $52 per ounce, more than triple the cost of silver.
165680	170780	Each gallon of seawater yields about 4.5 ounces of salt when evaporated, so his five
170780	177140	gallon jug could have carried enough water to make 22.5 ounces of salt or 1.4 pounds.
177140	183180	At that production rate, the cost per ounce is $16, but we can make it even cheaper—we
183180	185980	just need more five gallon jugs.
185980	193700	If we buy, say, nine more five gallon jugs at $6.41 each, our total cost would be $419.98,
193700	197600	but we could make 14 pounds of salt.
197600	205800	That brings the cost down to $1.87 per ounce, but we can keep scaling this up to an extent.
205800	210920	Andy's method of transport was flying and at that base rate his total cargo capacity
210920	213880	was only the capacity of his carry-on bag.
213880	219880	The largest carry-on bags have a capacity of 45 liters or 11.8 gallons.
219880	225060	One gallon of salt weighs 18.1 pounds, so assuming nobody ever checks the bag, Andy
225060	228980	could have carried 213.6 pounds of salt.
228980	235060	To produce that much, Andy would have needed 153 five gallon jugs and the boat he was on
235060	239700	could have only carried about 10, so he would have needed to rent 15 more.
239700	245640	So if we add together the plane ticket, the 153 gallon jugs, and the 16 boat rentals,
245640	250740	we get a total price of $2,191.58.
250740	255660	A lot more, but it's worth it because at this production rate, the salt only costs
255660	259840	64 cents per ounce, but we can keep scaling.
259840	265460	The average rate to hire a Los Angeles based 40 foot semi-truck is $2 per mile.
265460	271380	To drive the 1,912 miles from Los Angeles, California to Minneapolis, Minnesota, it would
271380	275720	therefore cost $3,824.
275720	286480	The usable capacity for these trucks is 2,395 cubic feet or 17,916 liquid gallons or 325,000
286480	287480	pounds worth of salt.
287480	293240	Sounds great, but the US only allows a total gross weight of 80,000 pounds on the road
293240	297680	and that has to include the weight of the truck itself so the actual transport capacity
297680	300680	is only about 40,000 pounds.
300680	305960	Salt is just so dense that we can't load a truck to its full volume capacity.
305960	312640	So we'll just produce 40,000 pounds of salt and for that we'd need 2,857 boat rentals
312640	317120	and 28,571 five gallon jugs.
317120	321640	For the sake of explanation, we'll pretend that we can't reuse the five gallon jugs.
321640	332040	Those boat rentals would total up to $162,849 and the jugs would add up to $183,141.
332040	337280	So, including the transport cost by truck, producing 40,000 pounds of salt would cost
337280	339280	$349,814.
339280	344620	That's now a cost of $0.54 per ounce.
344620	349120	As you can see, as you get into higher and higher levels of production, the advantage
349120	351640	of producing more grows smaller.
351640	357720	It was 25 times cheaper to produce 214 pounds of salt than to produce 1.4 pounds of salt
357720	363660	on a 152 times increase in production, but increasing the production from 214 pounds
363660	371200	to 40,000 pounds—a 314 times increase—only decreases the price by 1.19 times.
371200	374040	Let's shake up the production process.
374040	378600	Instead of boiling the seawater down to salt in Los Angeles and transporting it to Minneapolis,
378600	383520	let's say that Andy transported the seawater to Minneapolis then boiled it down.
383520	385000	What would it cost then?
385000	390760	Well, seawater weighs about 8.6 pounds per gallon and once again, we can only carry about
390760	395260	40,000 pounds or 4,651 gallons.
395260	407720	This will cost $3,824 for the truck, $5,968 for 931 five gallon jugs, $5,358 for 94 boat
407720	413700	rentals, and in the end will only yield 1,308 pounds of salt.
413700	418640	To make these 1,308 pounds, we spent 60 cents per ounce.
418640	422600	A difference of 6 cents per gallon may not seem like a big deal, but once you get to
422600	430760	the scale of producing, say, 100,000 pounds of salt, those 6 cents add up to $96,000—more
430760	434360	than the price of a Tesla Model S.
434360	438040	This demonstrates a very important principle in manufacturing.
438040	443080	There are essentially two types of products—weight losing and weight gaining.
443080	446720	Salt is one of the greatest examples of a weight losing product.
446720	452400	You put in a lot of raw materials, in this case seawater, to make a little product.
452400	456440	Obviously it doesn't make sense to ship the raw seawater cross country when you can
456440	459000	just boil it down in Los Angeles.
459000	463480	This is why processing plants for almost all weight losing products will be located near
463480	465040	the source.
465040	467640	The other type of product is weight gaining.
467640	473280	You take a small amount of raw material and make it into something much heavier or larger.
473280	475980	A great example of this is Coca-Cola.
475980	481240	They have more than 900 bottling plants worldwide just so they can lower costs.
481240	486360	If transport was not a factor at all, they could achieve lower costs by having one single
486360	487360	mega-factoring.
487360	492140	But once their soda is made, they still have to get it to the end consumer.
492140	496340	The cost of transport is closely linked to weight so since they just take a small amount
496340	501540	of flavors and ingredients and add it to water—something available almost anywhere—it makes sense
501540	504540	to produce their product near the end consumer.
504540	510180	Overall, we achieved a 92-fold reduction in cost of salt by using the principles of mass
510180	511340	production.
511340	516140	Every single ingredient Andy George used to make his $1,500 sandwich could have benefited
516140	518520	from the principles of mass production.
518520	520320	We also could have gone even further.
520320	523520	We could have rented a bigger boat, used bigger containers.
523520	526880	There were plenty of ways we could have driven down prices even more.
526880	532240	But these type of cost reductions make the difference in our modern world between a $1,500
532240	534860	and a $5 chicken sandwich.
