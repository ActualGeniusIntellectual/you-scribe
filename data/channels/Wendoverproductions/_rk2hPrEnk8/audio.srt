00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,300
About a year ago, Andy George from the channel How to Make Everything released a video called

2
00:00:05,300 --> 00:00:08,940
How to Make a $1500 Sandwich in Only 6 Months.

3
00:00:08,940 --> 00:00:13,100
I made a chicken sandwich completely from scratch, which cost $1500 in six months of

4
00:00:13,100 --> 00:00:14,380
my life.

5
00:00:14,380 --> 00:00:15,780
The video was hugely successful.

6
00:00:15,780 --> 00:00:17,660
It got millions of views.

7
00:00:17,660 --> 00:00:21,220
Then, a few weeks ago, Andy came to me with a question.

8
00:00:21,220 --> 00:00:24,900
Obviously I didn't use the most efficient method of making my sandwich, but why is there

9
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:29,160
such a huge gap in price between the sandwich I made for $1500 and one you can just buy

10
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:31,540
at a store for much less?

11
00:00:31,540 --> 00:00:36,320
My nearest grocery store sells pre-made chicken sandwiches for two pounds—about two and

12
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:37,820
a half US dollars.

13
00:00:37,820 --> 00:00:41,300
That's 600 times cheaper than Andy's sandwich.

14
00:00:41,300 --> 00:00:46,540
The economic principle that really makes the modern commercial world go round is economies

15
00:00:46,540 --> 00:00:47,700
of scale.

16
00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:52,160
You might remember from history class that an important step in the development of humanity

17
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:55,460
was the beginning of specialization of labor.

18
00:00:55,460 --> 00:01:00,000
That was the point when advancements in technology were far enough along that the amount of food

19
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,840
one person could produce was higher than the amount one person needed to survive.

20
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:10,160
Since there was a surplus, some people could go and do other things, like science, research,

21
00:01:10,160 --> 00:01:12,440
writing, and even production.

22
00:01:12,440 --> 00:01:16,640
This also helped spur the development of the first real cities since everyone didn't

23
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:18,840
have to live on farms.

24
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:22,900
Specialization of labor was in a way the very beginning of the use of economies of scale

25
00:01:22,900 --> 00:01:27,360
because instead of everyone growing and making everything they needed, different people did

26
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:31,240
what they did best and exchanged goods to get what they needed.

27
00:01:31,240 --> 00:01:36,940
Fast forward almost 10,000 years and the world is almost entirely specialized.

28
00:01:36,940 --> 00:01:41,280
Individuals almost never make things for themselves, except for Andy George.

29
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:45,500
I challenged myself to see if I could as an individual make something as basic as a sandwich

30
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:46,500
entirely by myself.

31
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:50,640
I grew all my own vegetables, harvested and ground my own wheat to make bread, killed

32
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:54,860
and butchered my own chicken, and even flew all the way from Minneapolis to LA to collect

33
00:01:54,860 --> 00:01:57,060
ocean water to boil down for salt.

34
00:01:57,060 --> 00:01:59,500
The salt is what we're going to focus on.

35
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:04,220
The reason is because Andy's salt production process was almost identical to that of a

36
00:02:04,220 --> 00:02:05,460
larger firm.

37
00:02:05,460 --> 00:02:10,700
He had to gather raw materials, process it into a product, then transport it to a final

38
00:02:10,700 --> 00:02:11,700
market.

39
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:16,580
Those three steps have been optimized in our modern world to yield insane cost reductions.

40
00:02:16,580 --> 00:02:23,880
In order to make my salt, I spent $298.88 on a plane ticket, $57 to rent a boat, and

41
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:27,160
$6.41 for a five gallon jug.

42
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:29,680
All just to gather the few ounces of salt I needed.

43
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:34,000
He only needed a small amount, but for the same price, he could have gathered more than

44
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,520
a pound's worth.

45
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:39,480
For his six ounces of salt, Andy paid $362.40.

46
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:45,680
That's $52 per ounce, more than triple the cost of silver.

47
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:50,780
Each gallon of seawater yields about 4.5 ounces of salt when evaporated, so his five

48
00:02:50,780 --> 00:02:57,140
gallon jug could have carried enough water to make 22.5 ounces of salt or 1.4 pounds.

49
00:02:57,140 --> 00:03:03,180
At that production rate, the cost per ounce is $16, but we can make it even cheaper—we

50
00:03:03,180 --> 00:03:05,980
just need more five gallon jugs.

51
00:03:05,980 --> 00:03:13,700
If we buy, say, nine more five gallon jugs at $6.41 each, our total cost would be $419.98,

52
00:03:13,700 --> 00:03:17,600
but we could make 14 pounds of salt.

53
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:25,800
That brings the cost down to $1.87 per ounce, but we can keep scaling this up to an extent.

54
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:30,920
Andy's method of transport was flying and at that base rate his total cargo capacity

55
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:33,880
was only the capacity of his carry-on bag.

56
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:39,880
The largest carry-on bags have a capacity of 45 liters or 11.8 gallons.

57
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:45,060
One gallon of salt weighs 18.1 pounds, so assuming nobody ever checks the bag, Andy

58
00:03:45,060 --> 00:03:48,980
could have carried 213.6 pounds of salt.

59
00:03:48,980 --> 00:03:55,060
To produce that much, Andy would have needed 153 five gallon jugs and the boat he was on

60
00:03:55,060 --> 00:03:59,700
could have only carried about 10, so he would have needed to rent 15 more.

61
00:03:59,700 --> 00:04:05,640
So if we add together the plane ticket, the 153 gallon jugs, and the 16 boat rentals,

62
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:10,740
we get a total price of $2,191.58.

63
00:04:10,740 --> 00:04:15,660
A lot more, but it's worth it because at this production rate, the salt only costs

64
00:04:15,660 --> 00:04:19,840
64 cents per ounce, but we can keep scaling.

65
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:25,460
The average rate to hire a Los Angeles based 40 foot semi-truck is $2 per mile.

66
00:04:25,460 --> 00:04:31,380
To drive the 1,912 miles from Los Angeles, California to Minneapolis, Minnesota, it would

67
00:04:31,380 --> 00:04:35,720
therefore cost $3,824.

68
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:46,480
The usable capacity for these trucks is 2,395 cubic feet or 17,916 liquid gallons or 325,000

69
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:47,480
pounds worth of salt.

70
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:53,240
Sounds great, but the US only allows a total gross weight of 80,000 pounds on the road

71
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:57,680
and that has to include the weight of the truck itself so the actual transport capacity

72
00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:00,680
is only about 40,000 pounds.

73
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:05,960
Salt is just so dense that we can't load a truck to its full volume capacity.

74
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:12,640
So we'll just produce 40,000 pounds of salt and for that we'd need 2,857 boat rentals

75
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:17,120
and 28,571 five gallon jugs.

76
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:21,640
For the sake of explanation, we'll pretend that we can't reuse the five gallon jugs.

77
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:32,040
Those boat rentals would total up to $162,849 and the jugs would add up to $183,141.

78
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:37,280
So, including the transport cost by truck, producing 40,000 pounds of salt would cost

79
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:39,280
$349,814.

80
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:44,620
That's now a cost of $0.54 per ounce.

81
00:05:44,620 --> 00:05:49,120
As you can see, as you get into higher and higher levels of production, the advantage

82
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:51,640
of producing more grows smaller.

83
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:57,720
It was 25 times cheaper to produce 214 pounds of salt than to produce 1.4 pounds of salt

84
00:05:57,720 --> 00:06:03,660
on a 152 times increase in production, but increasing the production from 214 pounds

85
00:06:03,660 --> 00:06:11,200
to 40,000 pounds—a 314 times increase—only decreases the price by 1.19 times.

86
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:14,040
Let's shake up the production process.

87
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:18,600
Instead of boiling the seawater down to salt in Los Angeles and transporting it to Minneapolis,

88
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:23,520
let's say that Andy transported the seawater to Minneapolis then boiled it down.

89
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:25,000
What would it cost then?

90
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:30,760
Well, seawater weighs about 8.6 pounds per gallon and once again, we can only carry about

91
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:35,260
40,000 pounds or 4,651 gallons.

92
00:06:35,260 --> 00:06:47,720
This will cost $3,824 for the truck, $5,968 for 931 five gallon jugs, $5,358 for 94 boat

93
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:53,700
rentals, and in the end will only yield 1,308 pounds of salt.

94
00:06:53,700 --> 00:06:58,640
To make these 1,308 pounds, we spent 60 cents per ounce.

95
00:06:58,640 --> 00:07:02,600
A difference of 6 cents per gallon may not seem like a big deal, but once you get to

96
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:10,760
the scale of producing, say, 100,000 pounds of salt, those 6 cents add up to $96,000—more

97
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:14,360
than the price of a Tesla Model S.

98
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:18,040
This demonstrates a very important principle in manufacturing.

99
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:23,080
There are essentially two types of products—weight losing and weight gaining.

100
00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:26,720
Salt is one of the greatest examples of a weight losing product.

101
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:32,400
You put in a lot of raw materials, in this case seawater, to make a little product.

102
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:36,440
Obviously it doesn't make sense to ship the raw seawater cross country when you can

103
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:39,000
just boil it down in Los Angeles.

104
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:43,480
This is why processing plants for almost all weight losing products will be located near

105
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:45,040
the source.

106
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:47,640
The other type of product is weight gaining.

107
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:53,280
You take a small amount of raw material and make it into something much heavier or larger.

108
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:55,980
A great example of this is Coca-Cola.

109
00:07:55,980 --> 00:08:01,240
They have more than 900 bottling plants worldwide just so they can lower costs.

110
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:06,360
If transport was not a factor at all, they could achieve lower costs by having one single

111
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:07,360
mega-factoring.

112
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:12,140
But once their soda is made, they still have to get it to the end consumer.

113
00:08:12,140 --> 00:08:16,340
The cost of transport is closely linked to weight so since they just take a small amount

114
00:08:16,340 --> 00:08:21,540
of flavors and ingredients and add it to water—something available almost anywhere—it makes sense

115
00:08:21,540 --> 00:08:24,540
to produce their product near the end consumer.

116
00:08:24,540 --> 00:08:30,180
Overall, we achieved a 92-fold reduction in cost of salt by using the principles of mass

117
00:08:30,180 --> 00:08:31,340
production.

118
00:08:31,340 --> 00:08:36,140
Every single ingredient Andy George used to make his $1,500 sandwich could have benefited

119
00:08:36,140 --> 00:08:38,520
from the principles of mass production.

120
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:40,320
We also could have gone even further.

121
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:43,520
We could have rented a bigger boat, used bigger containers.

122
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:46,880
There were plenty of ways we could have driven down prices even more.

123
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:52,240
But these type of cost reductions make the difference in our modern world between a $1,500

124
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:54,860
and a $5 chicken sandwich.

125
00:08:54,860 --> 00:08:57,400
