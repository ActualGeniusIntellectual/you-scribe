00:03.040 --> 00:06.920
When you sign up at the link in the description, you'll also get access to Nebula—the streaming

00:06.920 --> 00:10.680
video platform that Wendover is a part of.

00:10.680 --> 00:14.520
As you reach the end of a movie's credit sequence, usually long after everyone has

00:14.520 --> 00:18.120
left the theater, you start to get to some of the names of people that might not have

00:18.120 --> 00:21.480
written the script, might not have played the characters, and might not have operated

00:21.480 --> 00:25.160
the camera, but were crucial to the success of that film.

00:25.160 --> 00:28.620
Quite a few of the names might not have dealt with filming at all, but rather dealt with

00:28.620 --> 00:32.860
getting those who did housed, fed, and transported to where they need to be.

00:32.860 --> 00:37.320
As much of a challenge getting the story and picture right in a movie is, another distinct

00:37.320 --> 00:41.580
challenge that only escalates as budget does is the logistics.

00:41.580 --> 00:45.700
While most movies will film quite a few of their scenes in a studio using sets, green

00:45.700 --> 00:50.180
screens, and other tactics to portray the supposed location, still most film a number

00:50.180 --> 00:53.700
of scenes on location all around the world.

00:53.700 --> 00:58.520
Filming on location is an enormously complex multi-month or sometimes multi-year process

00:58.520 --> 01:02.360
that all typically starts with one person—the location scout.

01:02.360 --> 01:07.160
We'll use the example of what is now the most financially successful movie of all time,

01:07.160 --> 01:08.760
Avengers Endgame.

01:08.760 --> 01:13.080
As one of the biggest budget films of all time, the movie had a whole location department

01:13.080 --> 01:16.280
that wrapped many of the location-based functions into one.

01:16.280 --> 01:20.120
For smaller films, though, location scouts tend to be more separate, freelance roles

01:20.120 --> 01:22.980
working temporarily for a given production.

01:22.980 --> 01:26.720
Essentially what they do is take the wishes of the writer or director of a given movie

01:26.720 --> 01:29.000
and do their very best to fulfill them.

01:29.000 --> 01:34.080
If a scout is asked to find a sunny yet run-down street in a small coastal Mediterranean town,

01:34.080 --> 01:37.920
they do their best to find a location that looks like that, but it doesn't necessarily

01:37.920 --> 01:43.020
need to be sunny, run-down, coastal, Mediterranean, or even a small town.

01:43.020 --> 01:46.840
Some of that can be fixed in post, some can be fixed with decoration, and some doesn't

01:46.840 --> 01:48.440
show up on film at all.

01:48.440 --> 01:52.120
There are a lot of reasons a film might use a stand-in for the real location they're

01:52.120 --> 01:57.220
trying to depict—cost, time, practicality, availability, bureaucracy, logistics, or even

01:57.220 --> 02:00.860
down to tiny reasons like weather, lighting, noise level, and more.

02:00.860 --> 02:05.200
A film set in a small Greenlandic town might choose to film in Iceland just because it's

02:05.200 --> 02:09.360
easier to get to, has better infrastructure, and has a larger and perhaps more experienced

02:09.360 --> 02:10.740
local labor force.

02:10.740 --> 02:14.600
At the same time, a film set in Antarctica might choose to film in Greenland for the

02:14.600 --> 02:15.600
same reasons.

02:15.600 --> 02:19.640
Once the location scout finds the perfect location, they then have to make sure filming

02:19.640 --> 02:21.400
is actually possible there.

02:21.400 --> 02:25.100
If it's a privately owned location, they have to figure out who the owner is and negotiate

02:25.100 --> 02:28.560
with them, which isn't always easy, while if it's public space they have to work with

02:28.560 --> 02:31.480
the government, which also isn't always easy.

02:31.480 --> 02:35.640
In the case of Endgame, some location scout at some point was asked to find a location

02:35.640 --> 02:39.420
to serve as New Asgard—the fishing village home of Thor.

02:39.420 --> 02:42.680
For this, they settled on the Scottish village of St. Abbs.

02:42.680 --> 02:46.140
Now, there are a few reasons why this was a smart choice.

02:46.140 --> 02:49.940
One was that it's in a country with an upstart film industry promoted by its government so

02:49.940 --> 02:53.620
government approval was likely easy, two was that this village was small enough that

02:53.620 --> 02:57.340
they could essentially entirely take it over, and three was that it was relatively near

02:57.340 --> 02:58.540
Edinburgh.

02:58.540 --> 03:01.580
Proximity to Edinburgh served two important roles.

03:01.580 --> 03:05.120
One was that it meant there was a big city nearby with the facilities to host a large

03:05.120 --> 03:09.580
production and two was that, for the previous Avengers movie, Infinity War, they spent months

03:09.580 --> 03:12.220
filming a complex action sequence in Edinburgh.

03:12.220 --> 03:16.760
The two films were shot back to back and, in some cases, simultaneously, so this way,

03:16.760 --> 03:21.160
the production could easily move from Edinburgh to St. Abbs for a few days after rather than

03:21.160 --> 03:25.900
completely moving to a new country to film this relatively simple scene in New Asgard.

03:25.900 --> 03:30.240
In practice, a location scout typically presents the movie's director a variety of options

03:30.240 --> 03:31.640
for where to shoot.

03:31.640 --> 03:35.840
For New Asgard, there almost certainly were quite a few locations on a shortlist before

03:35.840 --> 03:37.840
they settled on St. Abbs.

03:37.840 --> 03:42.400
Once a location is selected, though, the job is then handed over to a location manager.

03:42.560 --> 03:46.940
Now, sometimes the location scout and location manager are the same person and sometimes

03:46.940 --> 03:50.400
they are different people, but they are always distinct roles.

03:50.400 --> 03:54.960
The location manager is in charge of navigating all the legal and logistical aspects of organizing

03:54.960 --> 03:58.160
an on-location shoot once the location is selected.

03:58.160 --> 04:02.560
One huge aspect of this is getting permits to film from the local government.

04:02.560 --> 04:06.520
A lot of cities, states, regions, or countries that are in high demand for filming, such

04:06.520 --> 04:11.320
as New York, have government agencies dedicated to both promoting and organizing filming activities

04:11.320 --> 04:12.600
in their location.

04:12.600 --> 04:16.600
In New York's case, for example, the mayor's office of film, theater, and broadcasting

04:16.600 --> 04:19.400
fills this role and handles the permitting process.

04:19.400 --> 04:23.300
An agency like this wants to balance its role of promoting the industry, which can be a

04:23.300 --> 04:27.760
fantastic boost economically to a city, and serving its city's population.

04:27.760 --> 04:32.940
Filming, especially when part of a big production, is a burden on local residents so any government

04:32.940 --> 04:37.260
that wants to stay popular with its constituents wants to manage this burden.

04:37.260 --> 04:41.800
Before this, New York's agency has a rotating list of locations where filming is prohibited

04:41.800 --> 04:45.100
simply because these locations have had too much filming recently.

04:45.100 --> 04:49.880
That way even the most popular spots won't have their residents disturbed too much.

04:49.880 --> 04:53.540
Negotiating a filming permit in places less experienced in this matter can be more difficult

04:53.540 --> 04:56.140
though as that will require a bespoke deal.

04:56.140 --> 05:01.140
That's only the tip of the iceberg of the planning a location manager has to deal with.

05:01.140 --> 05:06.020
One other, huge complexity can be just simply getting equipment to the location, especially

05:06.020 --> 05:09.820
if that location is in a different country than where the production company is based.

05:09.820 --> 05:14.140
You see, when Avengers came to Scotland to film, they needed all the same cameras and

05:14.140 --> 05:17.980
equipment as in the US so the film stayed consistent in quality.

05:17.980 --> 05:21.500
With big-budget productions such as this, that means they need to bring hundreds of

05:21.500 --> 05:25.040
thousands of dollars worth of equipment into a foreign country.

05:25.040 --> 05:29.140
The difficulty then is that, typically, when goods originate from outside of a country

05:29.140 --> 05:33.700
and are brought inside that country, one has to pay import tariffs on them.

05:33.700 --> 05:37.700
As an individual entering a country through an airport, one has certain duty-free allowances

05:37.700 --> 05:41.420
and typically there's a provision that personal articles can be brought in tax-free, but when

05:41.420 --> 05:45.080
traveling as a business, like a Hollywood production company, if they were to bring

05:45.080 --> 05:49.040
equipment into a country and keep it there, for example if they were setting up a studio

05:49.040 --> 05:52.020
there, then an import tariff would be assessed.

05:52.020 --> 05:55.820
Avengers likely traveled with hundreds of thousands or even millions of dollars worth

05:55.820 --> 06:00.620
of equipment so you can imagine the kind of financial damage a 20% import tariff would

06:00.620 --> 06:01.620
have.

06:01.620 --> 06:04.760
Of course, though, there are a few ways to get around this.

06:04.760 --> 06:07.600
The first would be to get an ATA Carnet.

06:07.600 --> 06:10.340
This is essentially a passport for goods.

06:10.340 --> 06:14.500
For a fee and security deposit, these work as a customs mechanism for many countries

06:14.500 --> 06:18.500
in which one can import goods temporarily without paying any taxes.

06:18.500 --> 06:21.840
These are complicated, though, because once issued there's little flexibility as one

06:21.840 --> 06:26.340
has to list exact travel dates and destinations and must also list all equipment including

06:26.340 --> 06:28.380
its exact serial number.

06:28.380 --> 06:33.180
Once the security deposit scales to the value of goods, it can also tie up a lot of money.

06:33.180 --> 06:36.460
The other option is to just rent equipment within the location country.

06:36.460 --> 06:40.980
While this is only an option when filming in countries with top quality rental companies,

06:40.980 --> 06:44.300
even Hollywood productions will quite often rent their equipment.

06:44.300 --> 06:47.060
Another thing the location manager has to think about is staffing.

06:47.060 --> 06:51.820
While the top positions in a production will obviously need to travel to each filming location,

06:51.820 --> 06:54.720
many of the rank and file members just do not.

06:54.720 --> 06:58.300
If you can get a lighting technician in the destination country rather than flying one

06:58.300 --> 07:02.560
out from the US, it would obviously make sense to hire the one in-country since that would

07:02.560 --> 07:03.560
lower cost.

07:03.560 --> 07:08.000
In the case of Avengers Endgame, the film shot in four main locations.

07:08.000 --> 07:12.240
The film studio was outside Atlanta, Georgia so many scenes were filmed in there and many

07:12.240 --> 07:14.920
that weren't took place in the greater Atlanta area.

07:14.920 --> 07:18.840
That's where everyone here, the bulk of the names in the credit sequence, were based.

07:18.840 --> 07:22.960
There was then a partially distinct production group for the film scenes in New York.

07:23.200 --> 07:26.440
You'll notice that there are not a whole lot of names in this group and they mostly

07:26.440 --> 07:30.480
correspond to location management roles and some other production management roles.

07:30.480 --> 07:34.760
Many of the bigger roles such as director of photography, director, producer, and more

07:34.760 --> 07:38.080
would be filled by those working back in Atlanta traveling out.

07:38.080 --> 07:42.320
The far larger and more distinct unit was the one dedicated to filming in England and

07:42.320 --> 07:43.320
Scotland.

07:43.320 --> 07:45.880
The movie had two major scenes filmed in the UK.

07:45.880 --> 07:49.920
One was in that small Scottish fishing village of St. Abbs playing New Asgard and the other

07:49.920 --> 07:54.120
was in Durham Cathedral which played the role of a part of Asgard, Thor's home.

07:54.120 --> 07:57.440
Now, these two locations were not insignificant in the film.

07:57.440 --> 08:01.120
They involved some of the film's lead characters and accounted for about 12 and a half total

08:01.120 --> 08:05.680
minutes of screen time which, in a movie as big budget as this, is a decent amount.

08:05.680 --> 08:08.880
Therefore, the on-location productions were sizable.

08:08.880 --> 08:12.480
The UK unit therefore had quite a number of specialized staff.

08:12.480 --> 08:17.720
It had its own graphic designers, set decorators, costume supervisor, sculptors, prop master,

08:17.720 --> 08:21.560
sound effect technicians, it even had its own administrative staff like a network and

08:21.560 --> 08:24.080
IT technician and payroll accountant.

08:24.080 --> 08:27.880
Sometimes though, those in charge of a movie don't need to be involved with filming at

08:27.880 --> 08:28.880
all.

08:28.880 --> 08:32.600
All of the logistics mess can be avoided if they just don't travel.

08:32.600 --> 08:36.280
Further down in the credits, you get to a section titled, plate units.

08:36.280 --> 08:39.640
These are distinct production units that are in charge of gathering footage that will end

08:39.640 --> 08:44.480
up being used by the movie's visual effects department, often as background in green screen

08:44.480 --> 08:45.480
sequences.

08:45.480 --> 08:49.160
When Marvel needed footage from a Brazilian national park to act as the landscape of the

08:49.160 --> 08:53.680
planet Vormir, they just hired a company called Brazil Production Services to go and film

08:53.680 --> 08:54.680
that for them.

08:54.680 --> 08:58.540
For the most part, this company was just left to get this footage on their own.

08:58.540 --> 09:02.040
When Marvel needed shots of the Philippines to serve as the landscape around Thanos'

09:02.040 --> 09:06.200
hut in the final movie, they once again just hired a local production company, Indochina

09:06.200 --> 09:10.560
Productions, to do the work for them since the character was added in post.

09:10.560 --> 09:14.440
Even for the biggest productions like this, when actors aren't involved, they can usually

09:14.440 --> 09:19.000
reduce complexity and cost by hiring outside production companies to do the work for them

09:19.000 --> 09:22.640
rather than flying one of their production units all the way out to Brazil or the Philippines

09:22.640 --> 09:25.080
or wherever to get that one shot.

09:25.080 --> 09:29.840
In addition to those two, Marvel also hired production companies in Tokyo, Iceland, Chile,

09:29.840 --> 09:33.600
and San Francisco to each capture footage that would end up as assets used by the visual

09:33.600 --> 09:34.600
effects department.

09:34.600 --> 09:38.840
When it actually comes time to film a scene on location, all of the planning is finally

09:38.840 --> 09:40.540
put into practice.

09:40.540 --> 09:44.140
One important aspect of the implementation is making sure that the community where one

09:44.140 --> 09:49.160
films walks away from the experience feeling like it was fun and cool rather than a burden.

09:49.160 --> 09:52.540
This is also crucial for the government of a given area which will typically want the

09:52.540 --> 09:57.420
economic boost from a film production coming while also wanting to keep public favor.

09:57.420 --> 10:01.600
Again using the example of St. Ab's, Scotland, such a big production coming meant the town

10:01.600 --> 10:04.360
was basically completely shut down for two days.

10:04.360 --> 10:08.380
They cordoned off essentially the whole town so only residents and workers could come in.

10:08.380 --> 10:12.540
Marvel made a lot of smart decisions to win over the residents of St. Ab's.

10:12.560 --> 10:17.040
For one, many of the residents were used as extras which certainly turned it into an experience

10:17.040 --> 10:18.040
for them.

10:18.040 --> 10:21.500
In addition, for feeding the crew, rather than bring in some catering company, they

10:21.500 --> 10:23.840
hired a local cafe to serve food.

10:23.840 --> 10:26.340
That way they're seen as supporting local businesses.

10:26.340 --> 10:30.480
In addition, the stars were reportedly generous with their time meeting many of the locals

10:30.480 --> 10:33.960
and Marvel made a financial donation to the St. Ab's lifeboat crew.

10:33.960 --> 10:38.080
In all, this made for a win for both the town and Marvel as Marvel got a location with a

10:38.080 --> 10:43.100
supporting public and good press and the town got a cool experience and economic benefit.

10:43.100 --> 10:46.880
That economic benefit has even kept coming after the shoot as St. Ab's has apparently

10:46.880 --> 10:49.820
experienced a tourism boom since the film's release.

10:49.820 --> 10:53.840
No matter where a film shoots, a huge part of the location manager's job is to try

10:53.840 --> 10:56.920
and keep the production as low impact as possible.

10:56.920 --> 11:01.280
They have roles as minute as parking managers just to be sure that a given production can

11:01.280 --> 11:05.580
get in and out of their location as cleanly and efficiently as possible.

11:05.580 --> 11:09.260
With tightly packed schedules, films just don't have time for a dispute with the local

11:09.260 --> 11:13.160
population and local governments will often be quick to side with their constituents if

11:13.160 --> 11:16.020
they get too burdened by Hollywood coming to town.

11:16.020 --> 11:19.400
When successfully pulled off, though, big budget Hollywood productions can bring jobs

11:19.400 --> 11:23.560
to an area, bring attention to an area, they can really transform a place so the focus

11:23.560 --> 11:28.880
that many cities and countries put on attracting them is truly well placed.

11:28.880 --> 11:31.940
Any long-time Wendover viewer by this point knows about CuriosityStream.

11:31.940 --> 11:35.960
They're the streaming site, home to endless documentaries and non-fiction titles about

11:35.960 --> 11:38.620
history, technology, nature, science, and more.

11:38.620 --> 11:42.860
They've long represented one of the best deals out there at just $19.99 a year, but

11:42.860 --> 11:45.180
now this deal has gotten even better.

11:45.180 --> 11:49.520
When you sign up for a yearly subscription at CuriosityStream.com slash Wendover, you'll

11:49.520 --> 11:52.620
now also get unlimited access to Nebula.

11:52.620 --> 11:56.200
Nebula is a streaming site that I myself was involved with building.

11:56.200 --> 12:00.660
New Wendover and HAI videos all go up there completely ad-free, but also, the thing that

12:00.660 --> 12:05.700
really makes it special are the originals—shows made exclusively for Nebula.

12:05.700 --> 12:10.180
For example, RealLifeLore and Second Thought have a fantastic car review show called Grand

12:10.180 --> 12:11.420
Test Auto.

12:11.420 --> 12:15.600
The whole purpose of Nebula is that it allows us to get experimental and try new things

12:15.600 --> 12:19.580
since it doesn't rely on YouTube's algorithm or AdSense and who knows, maybe there's

12:19.580 --> 12:22.340
going to be a Wendover original in like, late November.

12:22.340 --> 12:26.900
