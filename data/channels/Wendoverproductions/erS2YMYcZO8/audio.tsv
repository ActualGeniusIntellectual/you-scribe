3040	6920	When you sign up at the link in the description, you'll also get access to Nebula—the streaming
6920	10680	video platform that Wendover is a part of.
10680	14520	As you reach the end of a movie's credit sequence, usually long after everyone has
14520	18120	left the theater, you start to get to some of the names of people that might not have
18120	21480	written the script, might not have played the characters, and might not have operated
21480	25160	the camera, but were crucial to the success of that film.
25160	28620	Quite a few of the names might not have dealt with filming at all, but rather dealt with
28620	32860	getting those who did housed, fed, and transported to where they need to be.
32860	37320	As much of a challenge getting the story and picture right in a movie is, another distinct
37320	41580	challenge that only escalates as budget does is the logistics.
41580	45700	While most movies will film quite a few of their scenes in a studio using sets, green
45700	50180	screens, and other tactics to portray the supposed location, still most film a number
50180	53700	of scenes on location all around the world.
53700	58520	Filming on location is an enormously complex multi-month or sometimes multi-year process
58520	62360	that all typically starts with one person—the location scout.
62360	67160	We'll use the example of what is now the most financially successful movie of all time,
67160	68760	Avengers Endgame.
68760	73080	As one of the biggest budget films of all time, the movie had a whole location department
73080	76280	that wrapped many of the location-based functions into one.
76280	80120	For smaller films, though, location scouts tend to be more separate, freelance roles
80120	82980	working temporarily for a given production.
82980	86720	Essentially what they do is take the wishes of the writer or director of a given movie
86720	89000	and do their very best to fulfill them.
89000	94080	If a scout is asked to find a sunny yet run-down street in a small coastal Mediterranean town,
94080	97920	they do their best to find a location that looks like that, but it doesn't necessarily
97920	103020	need to be sunny, run-down, coastal, Mediterranean, or even a small town.
103020	106840	Some of that can be fixed in post, some can be fixed with decoration, and some doesn't
106840	108440	show up on film at all.
108440	112120	There are a lot of reasons a film might use a stand-in for the real location they're
112120	117220	trying to depict—cost, time, practicality, availability, bureaucracy, logistics, or even
117220	120860	down to tiny reasons like weather, lighting, noise level, and more.
120860	125200	A film set in a small Greenlandic town might choose to film in Iceland just because it's
125200	129360	easier to get to, has better infrastructure, and has a larger and perhaps more experienced
129360	130740	local labor force.
130740	134600	At the same time, a film set in Antarctica might choose to film in Greenland for the
134600	135600	same reasons.
135600	139640	Once the location scout finds the perfect location, they then have to make sure filming
139640	141400	is actually possible there.
141400	145100	If it's a privately owned location, they have to figure out who the owner is and negotiate
145100	148560	with them, which isn't always easy, while if it's public space they have to work with
148560	151480	the government, which also isn't always easy.
151480	155640	In the case of Endgame, some location scout at some point was asked to find a location
155640	159420	to serve as New Asgard—the fishing village home of Thor.
159420	162680	For this, they settled on the Scottish village of St. Abbs.
162680	166140	Now, there are a few reasons why this was a smart choice.
166140	169940	One was that it's in a country with an upstart film industry promoted by its government so
169940	173620	government approval was likely easy, two was that this village was small enough that
173620	177340	they could essentially entirely take it over, and three was that it was relatively near
177340	178540	Edinburgh.
178540	181580	Proximity to Edinburgh served two important roles.
181580	185120	One was that it meant there was a big city nearby with the facilities to host a large
185120	189580	production and two was that, for the previous Avengers movie, Infinity War, they spent months
189580	192220	filming a complex action sequence in Edinburgh.
192220	196760	The two films were shot back to back and, in some cases, simultaneously, so this way,
196760	201160	the production could easily move from Edinburgh to St. Abbs for a few days after rather than
201160	205900	completely moving to a new country to film this relatively simple scene in New Asgard.
205900	210240	In practice, a location scout typically presents the movie's director a variety of options
210240	211640	for where to shoot.
211640	215840	For New Asgard, there almost certainly were quite a few locations on a shortlist before
215840	217840	they settled on St. Abbs.
217840	222400	Once a location is selected, though, the job is then handed over to a location manager.
222560	226940	Now, sometimes the location scout and location manager are the same person and sometimes
226940	230400	they are different people, but they are always distinct roles.
230400	234960	The location manager is in charge of navigating all the legal and logistical aspects of organizing
234960	238160	an on-location shoot once the location is selected.
238160	242560	One huge aspect of this is getting permits to film from the local government.
242560	246520	A lot of cities, states, regions, or countries that are in high demand for filming, such
246520	251320	as New York, have government agencies dedicated to both promoting and organizing filming activities
251320	252600	in their location.
252600	256600	In New York's case, for example, the mayor's office of film, theater, and broadcasting
256600	259400	fills this role and handles the permitting process.
259400	263300	An agency like this wants to balance its role of promoting the industry, which can be a
263300	267760	fantastic boost economically to a city, and serving its city's population.
267760	272940	Filming, especially when part of a big production, is a burden on local residents so any government
272940	277260	that wants to stay popular with its constituents wants to manage this burden.
277260	281800	Before this, New York's agency has a rotating list of locations where filming is prohibited
281800	285100	simply because these locations have had too much filming recently.
285100	289880	That way even the most popular spots won't have their residents disturbed too much.
289880	293540	Negotiating a filming permit in places less experienced in this matter can be more difficult
293540	296140	though as that will require a bespoke deal.
296140	301140	That's only the tip of the iceberg of the planning a location manager has to deal with.
301140	306020	One other, huge complexity can be just simply getting equipment to the location, especially
306020	309820	if that location is in a different country than where the production company is based.
309820	314140	You see, when Avengers came to Scotland to film, they needed all the same cameras and
314140	317980	equipment as in the US so the film stayed consistent in quality.
317980	321500	With big-budget productions such as this, that means they need to bring hundreds of
321500	325040	thousands of dollars worth of equipment into a foreign country.
325040	329140	The difficulty then is that, typically, when goods originate from outside of a country
329140	333700	and are brought inside that country, one has to pay import tariffs on them.
333700	337700	As an individual entering a country through an airport, one has certain duty-free allowances
337700	341420	and typically there's a provision that personal articles can be brought in tax-free, but when
341420	345080	traveling as a business, like a Hollywood production company, if they were to bring
345080	349040	equipment into a country and keep it there, for example if they were setting up a studio
349040	352020	there, then an import tariff would be assessed.
352020	355820	Avengers likely traveled with hundreds of thousands or even millions of dollars worth
355820	360620	of equipment so you can imagine the kind of financial damage a 20% import tariff would
360620	361620	have.
361620	364760	Of course, though, there are a few ways to get around this.
364760	367600	The first would be to get an ATA Carnet.
367600	370340	This is essentially a passport for goods.
370340	374500	For a fee and security deposit, these work as a customs mechanism for many countries
374500	378500	in which one can import goods temporarily without paying any taxes.
378500	381840	These are complicated, though, because once issued there's little flexibility as one
381840	386340	has to list exact travel dates and destinations and must also list all equipment including
386340	388380	its exact serial number.
388380	393180	Once the security deposit scales to the value of goods, it can also tie up a lot of money.
393180	396460	The other option is to just rent equipment within the location country.
396460	400980	While this is only an option when filming in countries with top quality rental companies,
400980	404300	even Hollywood productions will quite often rent their equipment.
404300	407060	Another thing the location manager has to think about is staffing.
407060	411820	While the top positions in a production will obviously need to travel to each filming location,
411820	414720	many of the rank and file members just do not.
414720	418300	If you can get a lighting technician in the destination country rather than flying one
418300	422560	out from the US, it would obviously make sense to hire the one in-country since that would
422560	423560	lower cost.
423560	428000	In the case of Avengers Endgame, the film shot in four main locations.
428000	432240	The film studio was outside Atlanta, Georgia so many scenes were filmed in there and many
432240	434920	that weren't took place in the greater Atlanta area.
434920	438840	That's where everyone here, the bulk of the names in the credit sequence, were based.
438840	442960	There was then a partially distinct production group for the film scenes in New York.
443200	446440	You'll notice that there are not a whole lot of names in this group and they mostly
446440	450480	correspond to location management roles and some other production management roles.
450480	454760	Many of the bigger roles such as director of photography, director, producer, and more
454760	458080	would be filled by those working back in Atlanta traveling out.
458080	462320	The far larger and more distinct unit was the one dedicated to filming in England and
462320	463320	Scotland.
463320	465880	The movie had two major scenes filmed in the UK.
465880	469920	One was in that small Scottish fishing village of St. Abbs playing New Asgard and the other
469920	474120	was in Durham Cathedral which played the role of a part of Asgard, Thor's home.
474120	477440	Now, these two locations were not insignificant in the film.
477440	481120	They involved some of the film's lead characters and accounted for about 12 and a half total
481120	485680	minutes of screen time which, in a movie as big budget as this, is a decent amount.
485680	488880	Therefore, the on-location productions were sizable.
488880	492480	The UK unit therefore had quite a number of specialized staff.
492480	497720	It had its own graphic designers, set decorators, costume supervisor, sculptors, prop master,
497720	501560	sound effect technicians, it even had its own administrative staff like a network and
501560	504080	IT technician and payroll accountant.
504080	507880	Sometimes though, those in charge of a movie don't need to be involved with filming at
507880	508880	all.
508880	512600	All of the logistics mess can be avoided if they just don't travel.
512600	516280	Further down in the credits, you get to a section titled, plate units.
516280	519640	These are distinct production units that are in charge of gathering footage that will end
519640	524480	up being used by the movie's visual effects department, often as background in green screen
524480	525480	sequences.
525480	529160	When Marvel needed footage from a Brazilian national park to act as the landscape of the
529160	533680	planet Vormir, they just hired a company called Brazil Production Services to go and film
533680	534680	that for them.
534680	538540	For the most part, this company was just left to get this footage on their own.
538540	542040	When Marvel needed shots of the Philippines to serve as the landscape around Thanos'
542040	546200	hut in the final movie, they once again just hired a local production company, Indochina
546200	550560	Productions, to do the work for them since the character was added in post.
550560	554440	Even for the biggest productions like this, when actors aren't involved, they can usually
554440	559000	reduce complexity and cost by hiring outside production companies to do the work for them
559000	562640	rather than flying one of their production units all the way out to Brazil or the Philippines
562640	565080	or wherever to get that one shot.
565080	569840	In addition to those two, Marvel also hired production companies in Tokyo, Iceland, Chile,
569840	573600	and San Francisco to each capture footage that would end up as assets used by the visual
573600	574600	effects department.
574600	578840	When it actually comes time to film a scene on location, all of the planning is finally
578840	580540	put into practice.
580540	584140	One important aspect of the implementation is making sure that the community where one
584140	589160	films walks away from the experience feeling like it was fun and cool rather than a burden.
589160	592540	This is also crucial for the government of a given area which will typically want the
592540	597420	economic boost from a film production coming while also wanting to keep public favor.
597420	601600	Again using the example of St. Ab's, Scotland, such a big production coming meant the town
601600	604360	was basically completely shut down for two days.
604360	608380	They cordoned off essentially the whole town so only residents and workers could come in.
608380	612540	Marvel made a lot of smart decisions to win over the residents of St. Ab's.
612560	617040	For one, many of the residents were used as extras which certainly turned it into an experience
617040	618040	for them.
618040	621500	In addition, for feeding the crew, rather than bring in some catering company, they
621500	623840	hired a local cafe to serve food.
623840	626340	That way they're seen as supporting local businesses.
626340	630480	In addition, the stars were reportedly generous with their time meeting many of the locals
630480	633960	and Marvel made a financial donation to the St. Ab's lifeboat crew.
633960	638080	In all, this made for a win for both the town and Marvel as Marvel got a location with a
638080	643100	supporting public and good press and the town got a cool experience and economic benefit.
643100	646880	That economic benefit has even kept coming after the shoot as St. Ab's has apparently
646880	649820	experienced a tourism boom since the film's release.
649820	653840	No matter where a film shoots, a huge part of the location manager's job is to try
653840	656920	and keep the production as low impact as possible.
656920	661280	They have roles as minute as parking managers just to be sure that a given production can
661280	665580	get in and out of their location as cleanly and efficiently as possible.
665580	669260	With tightly packed schedules, films just don't have time for a dispute with the local
669260	673160	population and local governments will often be quick to side with their constituents if
673160	676020	they get too burdened by Hollywood coming to town.
676020	679400	When successfully pulled off, though, big budget Hollywood productions can bring jobs
679400	683560	to an area, bring attention to an area, they can really transform a place so the focus
683560	688880	that many cities and countries put on attracting them is truly well placed.
