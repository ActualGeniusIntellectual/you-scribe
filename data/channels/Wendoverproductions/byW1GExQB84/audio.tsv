13640	20100	COVID-19, a virus orders of magnitude smaller than a particle of dust, has turned daily
20100	24360	life on earth into something deeply unfamiliar.
24360	28600	In the ten or so months since it first emerged, the virus has settled at a steady clip of
28600	33640	killing 5,000 people per day, or nearly a million total, currently.
33640	38180	It has played havoc with the world economy, plunging the globe into the worst economic
38180	40400	crisis since World War II.
40400	45800	It has interrupted an era of mountain globalization and pushed us into a more insular, nationalistic
45800	46800	state.
46800	52760	The effects of this virus are truly all-encompassing and consistently dreadful, but time has bestowed
52760	56000	upon us a reward for our patience.
56000	61160	We are potentially nearing the beginning of the end, meaning we could now be at the end
61160	62320	of the middle.
62320	66520	That end of this virus will take far longer than the beginning—we're likely far from
66520	72080	halfway through the pandemic in terms of time—but the slow decline in dreadfulness is potentially
72080	73400	on the horizon.
73400	77560	That's because a vaccine is coming.
77560	81920	There was previously a period of doubt on whether an effective vaccine could be developed—it
81920	86840	was never a sure shot—but all indications currently suggest, given the unprecedented
86840	91660	extent of scientific effort, that it is indeed coming.
91660	96340	The only, and paramount question, is when.
96340	101720	Right now, in September 2020, all attention is focused on the late-October, early-November
101720	102720	timeframe.
102720	107560	That's the earliest possible moment when any of the front-runner vaccines, from major
107560	113200	manufacturers including AstraZeneca, Pfizer, and Moderna, could enter regulatory review.
113200	117960	If all the data confidently point to the vaccine exhibiting an acceptable level of safety and
117960	123000	effectiveness, it is possible that one of these will then be granted emergency use authorization
123000	127480	by the American FDA or its equivalent by other major national regulators.
127480	132640	It's worth noting that this is far from a sure shot, but experts do say that having
132640	137240	a vaccine in 2020 is a less than long shot possibility.
137240	144220	However, it is almost certain that you will not be injected by a COVID-19 vaccine in the
144220	146280	year 2020.
146280	152320	It is possible, but for the average person, when you actually get a dose of a COVID vaccine
152320	157600	has much less to do with when it's approved and much more with how fast it is manufactured
157600	158940	and distributed.
158940	164260	The full effects of the pandemic—health, social, and economic—will not end until
164260	167500	a critical mass of people are vaccinated.
167500	172020	That means that when we get back to normal life has much more to do with when the last
172020	175540	person is vaccinated, rather than the first.
175540	180820	This is why some have said that the fast distribution of a vaccine will be an even greater challenge
180820	182840	than the development itself.
182840	187820	This process, this challenge of getting the majority of the world's population vaccinated,
187820	192840	can quite legitimately be described as the most daunting and consequential single logistical
192840	194500	challenge ever.
194500	199580	The stakes have never been higher, but the challenge has also never been greater.
199580	202240	Let's look at why.
202240	204780	First and foremost, it's a scale problem.
204780	208900	Shipping and administering one vaccine to one person is not difficult, but shipping
208900	213340	and administering five billion vaccines to five billion people is.
213860	217860	That's because there just isn't enough room in our world's logistics network, as
217860	220020	it is now, to do that.
220020	224620	Making it even tougher, there's more chance than not, based on the current leading vaccines,
224620	229860	that the first major vaccine to be approved will require two doses administered 21 or
229860	231800	28 days apart.
231800	234060	That doubles the challenge.
234060	238860	Distributing ten or more billion doses of a vaccine would be difficult enough in normal
238860	242100	times, but these are far from normal times.
242100	246840	With international travel all but non-existent, currently sitting at more than 90% down, passenger
246840	250820	airlines have dramatically cut back their international route networks.
250820	256020	Now, this is an issue because traditionally, some 50% of pharmaceuticals are shipped in
256020	260740	the belly hold of passenger aircraft rather than on dedicated freighters, as this can
260740	264280	help them get closer to their final destination faster.
264280	270060	With limited passenger service, overall cargo capacity is down about 30% while cargo demand
270060	275060	is only about 15% down, meaning there is already a supply crunch.
275060	279260	This has led to existing dedicated freighter aircraft being used more, additional dedicated
279260	283840	freighters coming into service, but still, due to constrained supply, a dramatic increase
283840	285640	in shipping costs.
285640	290500	Even already, before the COVID vaccine comes into the global logistics network, pharmaceutical
290500	294580	manufacturers have had to come up with new techniques to ship their goods including,
294580	298220	for example, flying their product to where shipping rates are cheaper and trucking them
298220	301660	to their final destination or chartering private planes.
301660	305740	Of course, the world already experienced a massive logistics challenge this year with
305740	309820	the distribution of personal protective equipment, and shippers were able to scale up for that
309820	314420	reasonably successfully, but there's one simple reason why it won't be so easy this
314420	317900	time around—the cold chain.
317900	320280	Vaccines are temperature sensitive.
320280	324640	Most all of them have to be stored in a highly precise, climate-controlled environment in
324640	326980	order to stay safe and effective.
326980	331540	So, the cold chain is the supply chain suited to shipping goods that need to be kept cold
331540	335220	or frozen, such as meat, chemicals, and pharmaceuticals.
335220	340340	Of course, the difficulty with the cold chain is that everything used has to be specialized.
340340	345060	The origin warehouse, the truck, the plane, the in-route warehouse, and the final destination
345060	348620	each need to have the equipment to keep the goods at the specified temperature, or the
348620	352460	goods have to be shipped in packaging that keeps them at the specified temperature.
352460	357540	Both options are complicated, and complication compounded by other complication is what makes
357540	360440	a true logistical challenge.
360440	362620	It doesn't end there, though.
362620	368540	One of the leading vaccine candidates, Pfizer's BNT162b2, must be stored and transported at
368540	372900	around negative 90 degrees Fahrenheit or negative 68 degrees Celsius.
372900	377940	That is far, far colder than the requirements of most vaccines, which can ship either at
377940	381940	refrigerated temperatures or a wider range of freezing temperatures.
381940	386520	A thermal requirement such as this is a whole different ballgame, and it means that they'll
386520	391100	be able to use only a subset of cold chain infrastructure, which is already a subset
391100	393620	of overall logistics infrastructure.
393620	398020	Beyond the issue of actually getting such a vaccine to a distribution site, most hospitals
398020	402100	don't even have facilities to keep a vaccine at such a temperature, let alone clinics or
402100	407480	pharmacies, meaning that even finding places that can receive this vaccine is a challenge.
407480	411920	Part of the reason why this obstacle has come up is that traditionally, vaccines are thoroughly
411920	415940	tested to determine what sort of storage and shipping conditions they can endure while
415940	420040	still staying safe and effective, but with the breakneck pace of development for these
420040	424360	COVID-19 vaccines, there likely will not have been enough time to conduct these tests before
424360	428600	distribution meaning they'll have to keep the standards at what's already proven.
428600	433720	So, to reiterate, already, a likely vaccine will only be able to be shipped through a
433720	439400	subset of a subset of a subset of an already strained logistics network to a subset of
439400	445360	sites and it'll need to happen many billions of times, but even the solution to these challenges
445360	447640	present additional challenges.
447640	452080	Pfizer, for example, knowing that the unique distribution requirements of their vaccine
452080	456080	could limit its commercial success, has developed a partial solution.
456080	461320	It's essentially a highly specialized standalone box that can, with the use of dry ice, keep
461320	465000	the vaccine at the required temperature for up to ten days.
465000	469040	This means that, hypothetically, the vaccine could be shipped through a more traditional
469040	474340	logistics network, however, this box has highly specific requirements.
474340	478620	For one, upon arrival, it can only be opened twice per day, not more than one minute at
478620	482520	a time, in order to keep the vaccines at the required temperature.
482520	486400	That means that a distribution site would need to accurately predict how many doses
486400	489580	they would need in a given day before that day.
489580	493360	If they take out too little, they'd be slowing the process by not vaccinating everyone they
493360	497680	can, but if they take out too much, they'd have potentially life-saving vaccines go to
497680	499600	waste at the end of the day.
499600	504280	Also, this box can only carry vaccines in multiples of a thousand, and keep in mind
504280	507200	that it only keeps cold for ten days.
507200	511880	So how, for example, do you go about getting the vaccine to a clinic that can only vaccinate
511880	515720	50 people in a day, like a rural clinic in a small town?
515720	521080	Even if shipping was instantaneous, they could only vaccinate 500 people in ten days, meaning
521080	523440	half their vaccines would go bad.
523440	527760	Pfizer is apparently developing a smaller temperature-controlled box to solve this problem,
527760	532600	but that means adding a whole other type of distribution, which increases complexity,
532600	534840	which slows the process down.
534840	540160	In its scenario planning, the American CDC mapped out a distribution process for if both
540160	545440	Pfizer and Moderna's vaccines are approved and, if this happened, the Pfizer vaccine
545440	549460	would be directed to only large distribution sites that would either have the facilities
549460	553780	for ultra-cold storage, or the capacity to vaccinate enough people that the short shelf
553780	556540	life of these vaccines wouldn't be an issue.
556540	561180	Then, the Moderna vaccine, which only requires traditional freezer temperatures, would be
561180	565180	directed to smaller sites with less advanced facilities.
565180	569500	This would certainly create a scenario in the US, and likely elsewhere, where the Pfizer
569500	573540	vaccine would be primarily distributed to people in cities, while the Moderna vaccine
573540	576680	would be the vaccine of choice for rural areas.
576680	581560	Another challenge that needs to be confronted is the order of operations for distribution.
581560	585040	The coronavirus affects different people in different ways.
585040	589560	This means that if we want a vaccine to save the most number of lives possible, the first
589560	594000	person in line should be that who is most susceptible to COVID-19, and the last person
594000	596960	in line should be that who is least susceptible.
596960	601560	One set of research modeled two scenarios—the first where, of the first three billion doses
601560	605640	available, 50 high-income countries buy up two billion of them.
605640	609600	The second was where the first three billion doses were distributed to countries proportionally
609600	612680	based on their population, regardless of wealth.
612680	618400	In this model, twice as many people died overall with the first scenario—the wealthy countries'
618400	622080	first scenario—than the equitable, proportional approach.
622080	627360	However, for vaccination purposes, it is the least wealthy countries—arguably those
627360	631440	that need the vaccine most—that are toughest to distribute to.
631440	636280	Poor countries tend to have limited cold-chain infrastructure, let alone normal logistics
636280	640560	infrastructure, and fragmented, poorly funded healthcare systems.
640560	644700	Distributing and administering a complex vaccine like Pfizer's will already be tough enough
644700	649020	in the wealthy countries like the United States, but just imagine how difficult it will be
649020	653960	to get a vaccine from distributor to someone's arm in rural Democratic Republic of the Congo,
653960	659400	for example, in ten days while keeping it at negative 90 degrees Fahrenheit.
659400	664960	How soon a COVID vaccine is administered will quite directly correlate to how many lives
664960	666240	are saved.
666240	671080	Every day of delay will, with certainty, lead to more death and despair.
671080	675380	The manufacturers are working as fast as they can—they are already producing millions
675380	679440	of doses of their vaccines before they're approved so they can be distributed as fast
679440	684280	as possible, and regulatory agencies have been preparing for months for an unprecedentedly
684280	691040	fast review process, so it is now truly down to every member of the global logistics network
691040	693160	to save lives.
693160	698880	Of course, many of those that will be involved, especially once we get to wide-scale distribution,
698880	704600	will be companies, not governments or non-profits, and for them, this presents a massive business
704600	708640	opportunity in addition to the positive public relations potential.
708640	713920	UPS, for example, has built two freezer farms in Louisville, Kentucky and Venlo, Netherlands,
713920	718120	for their hubs, which can each hold 48,000 doses and can go down to the temperatures
718120	719840	required for the Pfizer vaccine.
719840	724520	DHL and FedEx, too, are reportedly massively upscaling their cold-chain infrastructure
724520	728380	to be able to handle some of the surge in demand, while other lesser-known logistics
728380	730120	companies are, too.
730120	735480	Ultimately, though, it's tough to find someone in the know who doesn't admit that shipping
735480	737760	will be a bottleneck.
737760	742680	We already know it's not going to go perfectly, so right now, it's about doing as much work
742680	747000	as possible to make sure the process goes as well as it can be.
747000	751160	This will come down to making sure that as much planning work as possible is done now,
751160	756520	before the vaccine is approved, so that distribution can happen as fast as possible when that does
756520	757520	happen.
757520	762480	Now is the time to figure out how and where the vaccine will be distributed.
762480	767980	If you are a healthy, relatively young person and thinking selfishly, you should care tremendously
767980	773060	about the distribution process, because you are at the back of the line.
773060	777580	When you get your shot, when you get to start letting your guard down, has everything to
777580	782980	do with how fast everyone in front of you gets theirs, and how fast they get theirs
782980	786380	will also impact how many of them will die.
786380	790060	We know this process will not be perfect, and it wouldn't be reasonable to ask for
790060	795760	perfect given the complexity of the challenge, but if we truly put every effort into planning
795760	801800	and preparing for this now and create a system that orders people by need, rather than wealth,
801800	807000	we can at least know, at the end of this, that no lives could have been saved if only
807000	809920	the vaccine got to them faster.
809920	814400	For our collective consciousness, looking back far in the future, this moment will be
814400	820240	defined not by when we get to go back to concerts, or parties, or the gym, but rather by how
820240	825480	many lives we saved when confronting, what is hopefully, the greatest global challenge
825480	829120	of this generation.
829120	833500	As you've heard before, the point of Nebula, the streaming site that I and other independent
833500	838340	creators founded, is to make a greater variety of content types possible.
838340	842160	For example, I know many of you were fans of my and Brian from Real Engineering's
842160	846560	old podcast, Showmakers, where we interviewed different educational creators about their
846560	851400	background, story, and process, but the financials of that show just didn't work, so we stopped
851400	852400	it.
852400	856960	Nebula, however, has made it possible for us to relaunch it, so we've done exactly
856960	862160	that—Showmakers is now a Nebula Original Podcast.
862160	866640	This is in addition to the two Wendover Originals we've done already, the Half as Interesting
866640	870080	Original, and another Wendover Original that is coming out next month.
870080	874360	Of course, the best way to get access to Nebula is CuriosityStream's bundle deal, on sale
