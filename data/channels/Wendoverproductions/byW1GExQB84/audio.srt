4
00:00:13,640 --> 00:00:20,100
COVID-19, a virus orders of magnitude smaller than a particle of dust, has turned daily

5
00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:24,360
life on earth into something deeply unfamiliar.

6
00:00:24,360 --> 00:00:28,600
In the ten or so months since it first emerged, the virus has settled at a steady clip of

7
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:33,640
killing 5,000 people per day, or nearly a million total, currently.

8
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:38,180
It has played havoc with the world economy, plunging the globe into the worst economic

9
00:00:38,180 --> 00:00:40,400
crisis since World War II.

10
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:45,800
It has interrupted an era of mountain globalization and pushed us into a more insular, nationalistic

11
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:46,800
state.

12
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:52,760
The effects of this virus are truly all-encompassing and consistently dreadful, but time has bestowed

13
00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:56,000
upon us a reward for our patience.

14
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:01,160
We are potentially nearing the beginning of the end, meaning we could now be at the end

15
00:01:01,160 --> 00:01:02,320
of the middle.

16
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:06,520
That end of this virus will take far longer than the beginning—we're likely far from

17
00:01:06,520 --> 00:01:12,080
halfway through the pandemic in terms of time—but the slow decline in dreadfulness is potentially

18
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:13,400
on the horizon.

19
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:17,560
That's because a vaccine is coming.

20
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:21,920
There was previously a period of doubt on whether an effective vaccine could be developed—it

21
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:26,840
was never a sure shot—but all indications currently suggest, given the unprecedented

22
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:31,660
extent of scientific effort, that it is indeed coming.

23
00:01:31,660 --> 00:01:36,340
The only, and paramount question, is when.

24
00:01:36,340 --> 00:01:41,720
Right now, in September 2020, all attention is focused on the late-October, early-November

25
00:01:41,720 --> 00:01:42,720
timeframe.

26
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:47,560
That's the earliest possible moment when any of the front-runner vaccines, from major

27
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:53,200
manufacturers including AstraZeneca, Pfizer, and Moderna, could enter regulatory review.

28
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:57,960
If all the data confidently point to the vaccine exhibiting an acceptable level of safety and

29
00:01:57,960 --> 00:02:03,000
effectiveness, it is possible that one of these will then be granted emergency use authorization

30
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:07,480
by the American FDA or its equivalent by other major national regulators.

31
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:12,640
It's worth noting that this is far from a sure shot, but experts do say that having

32
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:17,240
a vaccine in 2020 is a less than long shot possibility.

33
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:24,220
However, it is almost certain that you will not be injected by a COVID-19 vaccine in the

34
00:02:24,220 --> 00:02:26,280
year 2020.

35
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:32,320
It is possible, but for the average person, when you actually get a dose of a COVID vaccine

36
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:37,600
has much less to do with when it's approved and much more with how fast it is manufactured

37
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:38,940
and distributed.

38
00:02:38,940 --> 00:02:44,260
The full effects of the pandemic—health, social, and economic—will not end until

39
00:02:44,260 --> 00:02:47,500
a critical mass of people are vaccinated.

40
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:52,020
That means that when we get back to normal life has much more to do with when the last

41
00:02:52,020 --> 00:02:55,540
person is vaccinated, rather than the first.

42
00:02:55,540 --> 00:03:00,820
This is why some have said that the fast distribution of a vaccine will be an even greater challenge

43
00:03:00,820 --> 00:03:02,840
than the development itself.

44
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:07,820
This process, this challenge of getting the majority of the world's population vaccinated,

45
00:03:07,820 --> 00:03:12,840
can quite legitimately be described as the most daunting and consequential single logistical

46
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:14,500
challenge ever.

47
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:19,580
The stakes have never been higher, but the challenge has also never been greater.

48
00:03:19,580 --> 00:03:22,240
Let's look at why.

49
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:24,780
First and foremost, it's a scale problem.

50
00:03:24,780 --> 00:03:28,900
Shipping and administering one vaccine to one person is not difficult, but shipping

51
00:03:28,900 --> 00:03:33,340
and administering five billion vaccines to five billion people is.

52
00:03:33,860 --> 00:03:37,860
That's because there just isn't enough room in our world's logistics network, as

53
00:03:37,860 --> 00:03:40,020
it is now, to do that.

54
00:03:40,020 --> 00:03:44,620
Making it even tougher, there's more chance than not, based on the current leading vaccines,

55
00:03:44,620 --> 00:03:49,860
that the first major vaccine to be approved will require two doses administered 21 or

56
00:03:49,860 --> 00:03:51,800
28 days apart.

57
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:54,060
That doubles the challenge.

58
00:03:54,060 --> 00:03:58,860
Distributing ten or more billion doses of a vaccine would be difficult enough in normal

59
00:03:58,860 --> 00:04:02,100
times, but these are far from normal times.

60
00:04:02,100 --> 00:04:06,840
With international travel all but non-existent, currently sitting at more than 90% down, passenger

61
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:10,820
airlines have dramatically cut back their international route networks.

62
00:04:10,820 --> 00:04:16,020
Now, this is an issue because traditionally, some 50% of pharmaceuticals are shipped in

63
00:04:16,020 --> 00:04:20,740
the belly hold of passenger aircraft rather than on dedicated freighters, as this can

64
00:04:20,740 --> 00:04:24,280
help them get closer to their final destination faster.

65
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:30,060
With limited passenger service, overall cargo capacity is down about 30% while cargo demand

66
00:04:30,060 --> 00:04:35,060
is only about 15% down, meaning there is already a supply crunch.

67
00:04:35,060 --> 00:04:39,260
This has led to existing dedicated freighter aircraft being used more, additional dedicated

68
00:04:39,260 --> 00:04:43,840
freighters coming into service, but still, due to constrained supply, a dramatic increase

69
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:45,640
in shipping costs.

70
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:50,500
Even already, before the COVID vaccine comes into the global logistics network, pharmaceutical

71
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:54,580
manufacturers have had to come up with new techniques to ship their goods including,

72
00:04:54,580 --> 00:04:58,220
for example, flying their product to where shipping rates are cheaper and trucking them

73
00:04:58,220 --> 00:05:01,660
to their final destination or chartering private planes.

74
00:05:01,660 --> 00:05:05,740
Of course, the world already experienced a massive logistics challenge this year with

75
00:05:05,740 --> 00:05:09,820
the distribution of personal protective equipment, and shippers were able to scale up for that

76
00:05:09,820 --> 00:05:14,420
reasonably successfully, but there's one simple reason why it won't be so easy this

77
00:05:14,420 --> 00:05:17,900
time around—the cold chain.

78
00:05:17,900 --> 00:05:20,280
Vaccines are temperature sensitive.

79
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:24,640
Most all of them have to be stored in a highly precise, climate-controlled environment in

80
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:26,980
order to stay safe and effective.

81
00:05:26,980 --> 00:05:31,540
So, the cold chain is the supply chain suited to shipping goods that need to be kept cold

82
00:05:31,540 --> 00:05:35,220
or frozen, such as meat, chemicals, and pharmaceuticals.

83
00:05:35,220 --> 00:05:40,340
Of course, the difficulty with the cold chain is that everything used has to be specialized.

84
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:45,060
The origin warehouse, the truck, the plane, the in-route warehouse, and the final destination

85
00:05:45,060 --> 00:05:48,620
each need to have the equipment to keep the goods at the specified temperature, or the

86
00:05:48,620 --> 00:05:52,460
goods have to be shipped in packaging that keeps them at the specified temperature.

87
00:05:52,460 --> 00:05:57,540
Both options are complicated, and complication compounded by other complication is what makes

88
00:05:57,540 --> 00:06:00,440
a true logistical challenge.

89
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:02,620
It doesn't end there, though.

90
00:06:02,620 --> 00:06:08,540
One of the leading vaccine candidates, Pfizer's BNT162b2, must be stored and transported at

91
00:06:08,540 --> 00:06:12,900
around negative 90 degrees Fahrenheit or negative 68 degrees Celsius.

92
00:06:12,900 --> 00:06:17,940
That is far, far colder than the requirements of most vaccines, which can ship either at

93
00:06:17,940 --> 00:06:21,940
refrigerated temperatures or a wider range of freezing temperatures.

94
00:06:21,940 --> 00:06:26,520
A thermal requirement such as this is a whole different ballgame, and it means that they'll

95
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:31,100
be able to use only a subset of cold chain infrastructure, which is already a subset

96
00:06:31,100 --> 00:06:33,620
of overall logistics infrastructure.

97
00:06:33,620 --> 00:06:38,020
Beyond the issue of actually getting such a vaccine to a distribution site, most hospitals

98
00:06:38,020 --> 00:06:42,100
don't even have facilities to keep a vaccine at such a temperature, let alone clinics or

99
00:06:42,100 --> 00:06:47,480
pharmacies, meaning that even finding places that can receive this vaccine is a challenge.

100
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:51,920
Part of the reason why this obstacle has come up is that traditionally, vaccines are thoroughly

101
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:55,940
tested to determine what sort of storage and shipping conditions they can endure while

102
00:06:55,940 --> 00:07:00,040
still staying safe and effective, but with the breakneck pace of development for these

103
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:04,360
COVID-19 vaccines, there likely will not have been enough time to conduct these tests before

104
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:08,600
distribution meaning they'll have to keep the standards at what's already proven.

105
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:13,720
So, to reiterate, already, a likely vaccine will only be able to be shipped through a

106
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:19,400
subset of a subset of a subset of an already strained logistics network to a subset of

107
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:25,360
sites and it'll need to happen many billions of times, but even the solution to these challenges

108
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:27,640
present additional challenges.

109
00:07:27,640 --> 00:07:32,080
Pfizer, for example, knowing that the unique distribution requirements of their vaccine

110
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:36,080
could limit its commercial success, has developed a partial solution.

111
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:41,320
It's essentially a highly specialized standalone box that can, with the use of dry ice, keep

112
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:45,000
the vaccine at the required temperature for up to ten days.

113
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:49,040
This means that, hypothetically, the vaccine could be shipped through a more traditional

114
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:54,340
logistics network, however, this box has highly specific requirements.

115
00:07:54,340 --> 00:07:58,620
For one, upon arrival, it can only be opened twice per day, not more than one minute at

116
00:07:58,620 --> 00:08:02,520
a time, in order to keep the vaccines at the required temperature.

117
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:06,400
That means that a distribution site would need to accurately predict how many doses

118
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:09,580
they would need in a given day before that day.

119
00:08:09,580 --> 00:08:13,360
If they take out too little, they'd be slowing the process by not vaccinating everyone they

120
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:17,680
can, but if they take out too much, they'd have potentially life-saving vaccines go to

121
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:19,600
waste at the end of the day.

122
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:24,280
Also, this box can only carry vaccines in multiples of a thousand, and keep in mind

123
00:08:24,280 --> 00:08:27,200
that it only keeps cold for ten days.

124
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:31,880
So how, for example, do you go about getting the vaccine to a clinic that can only vaccinate

125
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:35,720
50 people in a day, like a rural clinic in a small town?

126
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:41,080
Even if shipping was instantaneous, they could only vaccinate 500 people in ten days, meaning

127
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:43,440
half their vaccines would go bad.

128
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:47,760
Pfizer is apparently developing a smaller temperature-controlled box to solve this problem,

129
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:52,600
but that means adding a whole other type of distribution, which increases complexity,

130
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:54,840
which slows the process down.

131
00:08:54,840 --> 00:09:00,160
In its scenario planning, the American CDC mapped out a distribution process for if both

132
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:05,440
Pfizer and Moderna's vaccines are approved and, if this happened, the Pfizer vaccine

133
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:09,460
would be directed to only large distribution sites that would either have the facilities

134
00:09:09,460 --> 00:09:13,780
for ultra-cold storage, or the capacity to vaccinate enough people that the short shelf

135
00:09:13,780 --> 00:09:16,540
life of these vaccines wouldn't be an issue.

136
00:09:16,540 --> 00:09:21,180
Then, the Moderna vaccine, which only requires traditional freezer temperatures, would be

137
00:09:21,180 --> 00:09:25,180
directed to smaller sites with less advanced facilities.

138
00:09:25,180 --> 00:09:29,500
This would certainly create a scenario in the US, and likely elsewhere, where the Pfizer

139
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:33,540
vaccine would be primarily distributed to people in cities, while the Moderna vaccine

140
00:09:33,540 --> 00:09:36,680
would be the vaccine of choice for rural areas.

141
00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:41,560
Another challenge that needs to be confronted is the order of operations for distribution.

142
00:09:41,560 --> 00:09:45,040
The coronavirus affects different people in different ways.

143
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:49,560
This means that if we want a vaccine to save the most number of lives possible, the first

144
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:54,000
person in line should be that who is most susceptible to COVID-19, and the last person

145
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,960
in line should be that who is least susceptible.

146
00:09:56,960 --> 00:10:01,560
One set of research modeled two scenarios—the first where, of the first three billion doses

147
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:05,640
available, 50 high-income countries buy up two billion of them.

148
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:09,600
The second was where the first three billion doses were distributed to countries proportionally

149
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:12,680
based on their population, regardless of wealth.

150
00:10:12,680 --> 00:10:18,400
In this model, twice as many people died overall with the first scenario—the wealthy countries'

151
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:22,080
first scenario—than the equitable, proportional approach.

152
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:27,360
However, for vaccination purposes, it is the least wealthy countries—arguably those

153
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:31,440
that need the vaccine most—that are toughest to distribute to.

154
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:36,280
Poor countries tend to have limited cold-chain infrastructure, let alone normal logistics

155
00:10:36,280 --> 00:10:40,560
infrastructure, and fragmented, poorly funded healthcare systems.

156
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:44,700
Distributing and administering a complex vaccine like Pfizer's will already be tough enough

157
00:10:44,700 --> 00:10:49,020
in the wealthy countries like the United States, but just imagine how difficult it will be

158
00:10:49,020 --> 00:10:53,960
to get a vaccine from distributor to someone's arm in rural Democratic Republic of the Congo,

159
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:59,400
for example, in ten days while keeping it at negative 90 degrees Fahrenheit.

160
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:04,960
How soon a COVID vaccine is administered will quite directly correlate to how many lives

161
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:06,240
are saved.

162
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:11,080
Every day of delay will, with certainty, lead to more death and despair.

163
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:15,380
The manufacturers are working as fast as they can—they are already producing millions

164
00:11:15,380 --> 00:11:19,440
of doses of their vaccines before they're approved so they can be distributed as fast

165
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:24,280
as possible, and regulatory agencies have been preparing for months for an unprecedentedly

166
00:11:24,280 --> 00:11:31,040
fast review process, so it is now truly down to every member of the global logistics network

167
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:33,160
to save lives.

168
00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:38,880
Of course, many of those that will be involved, especially once we get to wide-scale distribution,

169
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:44,600
will be companies, not governments or non-profits, and for them, this presents a massive business

170
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:48,640
opportunity in addition to the positive public relations potential.

171
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:53,920
UPS, for example, has built two freezer farms in Louisville, Kentucky and Venlo, Netherlands,

172
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:58,120
for their hubs, which can each hold 48,000 doses and can go down to the temperatures

173
00:11:58,120 --> 00:11:59,840
required for the Pfizer vaccine.

174
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:04,520
DHL and FedEx, too, are reportedly massively upscaling their cold-chain infrastructure

175
00:12:04,520 --> 00:12:08,380
to be able to handle some of the surge in demand, while other lesser-known logistics

176
00:12:08,380 --> 00:12:10,120
companies are, too.

177
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:15,480
Ultimately, though, it's tough to find someone in the know who doesn't admit that shipping

178
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:17,760
will be a bottleneck.

179
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:22,680
We already know it's not going to go perfectly, so right now, it's about doing as much work

180
00:12:22,680 --> 00:12:27,000
as possible to make sure the process goes as well as it can be.

181
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:31,160
This will come down to making sure that as much planning work as possible is done now,

182
00:12:31,160 --> 00:12:36,520
before the vaccine is approved, so that distribution can happen as fast as possible when that does

183
00:12:36,520 --> 00:12:37,520
happen.

184
00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:42,480
Now is the time to figure out how and where the vaccine will be distributed.

185
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:47,980
If you are a healthy, relatively young person and thinking selfishly, you should care tremendously

186
00:12:47,980 --> 00:12:53,060
about the distribution process, because you are at the back of the line.

187
00:12:53,060 --> 00:12:57,580
When you get your shot, when you get to start letting your guard down, has everything to

188
00:12:57,580 --> 00:13:02,980
do with how fast everyone in front of you gets theirs, and how fast they get theirs

189
00:13:02,980 --> 00:13:06,380
will also impact how many of them will die.

190
00:13:06,380 --> 00:13:10,060
We know this process will not be perfect, and it wouldn't be reasonable to ask for

191
00:13:10,060 --> 00:13:15,760
perfect given the complexity of the challenge, but if we truly put every effort into planning

192
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:21,800
and preparing for this now and create a system that orders people by need, rather than wealth,

193
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:27,000
we can at least know, at the end of this, that no lives could have been saved if only

194
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,920
the vaccine got to them faster.

195
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:34,400
For our collective consciousness, looking back far in the future, this moment will be

196
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:40,240
defined not by when we get to go back to concerts, or parties, or the gym, but rather by how

197
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:45,480
many lives we saved when confronting, what is hopefully, the greatest global challenge

198
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:49,120
of this generation.

199
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:53,500
As you've heard before, the point of Nebula, the streaming site that I and other independent

200
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:58,340
creators founded, is to make a greater variety of content types possible.

201
00:13:58,340 --> 00:14:02,160
For example, I know many of you were fans of my and Brian from Real Engineering's

202
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:06,560
old podcast, Showmakers, where we interviewed different educational creators about their

203
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:11,400
background, story, and process, but the financials of that show just didn't work, so we stopped

204
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:12,400
it.

205
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:16,960
Nebula, however, has made it possible for us to relaunch it, so we've done exactly

206
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:22,160
that—Showmakers is now a Nebula Original Podcast.

207
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:26,640
This is in addition to the two Wendover Originals we've done already, the Half as Interesting

208
00:14:26,640 --> 00:14:30,080
Original, and another Wendover Original that is coming out next month.

209
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:34,360
Of course, the best way to get access to Nebula is CuriosityStream's bundle deal, on sale
