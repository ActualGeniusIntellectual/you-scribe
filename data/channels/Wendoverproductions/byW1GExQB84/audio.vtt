00:13.640 --> 00:20.100
COVID-19, a virus orders of magnitude smaller than a particle of dust, has turned daily

00:20.100 --> 00:24.360
life on earth into something deeply unfamiliar.

00:24.360 --> 00:28.600
In the ten or so months since it first emerged, the virus has settled at a steady clip of

00:28.600 --> 00:33.640
killing 5,000 people per day, or nearly a million total, currently.

00:33.640 --> 00:38.180
It has played havoc with the world economy, plunging the globe into the worst economic

00:38.180 --> 00:40.400
crisis since World War II.

00:40.400 --> 00:45.800
It has interrupted an era of mountain globalization and pushed us into a more insular, nationalistic

00:45.800 --> 00:46.800
state.

00:46.800 --> 00:52.760
The effects of this virus are truly all-encompassing and consistently dreadful, but time has bestowed

00:52.760 --> 00:56.000
upon us a reward for our patience.

00:56.000 --> 01:01.160
We are potentially nearing the beginning of the end, meaning we could now be at the end

01:01.160 --> 01:02.320
of the middle.

01:02.320 --> 01:06.520
That end of this virus will take far longer than the beginning—we're likely far from

01:06.520 --> 01:12.080
halfway through the pandemic in terms of time—but the slow decline in dreadfulness is potentially

01:12.080 --> 01:13.400
on the horizon.

01:13.400 --> 01:17.560
That's because a vaccine is coming.

01:17.560 --> 01:21.920
There was previously a period of doubt on whether an effective vaccine could be developed—it

01:21.920 --> 01:26.840
was never a sure shot—but all indications currently suggest, given the unprecedented

01:26.840 --> 01:31.660
extent of scientific effort, that it is indeed coming.

01:31.660 --> 01:36.340
The only, and paramount question, is when.

01:36.340 --> 01:41.720
Right now, in September 2020, all attention is focused on the late-October, early-November

01:41.720 --> 01:42.720
timeframe.

01:42.720 --> 01:47.560
That's the earliest possible moment when any of the front-runner vaccines, from major

01:47.560 --> 01:53.200
manufacturers including AstraZeneca, Pfizer, and Moderna, could enter regulatory review.

01:53.200 --> 01:57.960
If all the data confidently point to the vaccine exhibiting an acceptable level of safety and

01:57.960 --> 02:03.000
effectiveness, it is possible that one of these will then be granted emergency use authorization

02:03.000 --> 02:07.480
by the American FDA or its equivalent by other major national regulators.

02:07.480 --> 02:12.640
It's worth noting that this is far from a sure shot, but experts do say that having

02:12.640 --> 02:17.240
a vaccine in 2020 is a less than long shot possibility.

02:17.240 --> 02:24.220
However, it is almost certain that you will not be injected by a COVID-19 vaccine in the

02:24.220 --> 02:26.280
year 2020.

02:26.280 --> 02:32.320
It is possible, but for the average person, when you actually get a dose of a COVID vaccine

02:32.320 --> 02:37.600
has much less to do with when it's approved and much more with how fast it is manufactured

02:37.600 --> 02:38.940
and distributed.

02:38.940 --> 02:44.260
The full effects of the pandemic—health, social, and economic—will not end until

02:44.260 --> 02:47.500
a critical mass of people are vaccinated.

02:47.500 --> 02:52.020
That means that when we get back to normal life has much more to do with when the last

02:52.020 --> 02:55.540
person is vaccinated, rather than the first.

02:55.540 --> 03:00.820
This is why some have said that the fast distribution of a vaccine will be an even greater challenge

03:00.820 --> 03:02.840
than the development itself.

03:02.840 --> 03:07.820
This process, this challenge of getting the majority of the world's population vaccinated,

03:07.820 --> 03:12.840
can quite legitimately be described as the most daunting and consequential single logistical

03:12.840 --> 03:14.500
challenge ever.

03:14.500 --> 03:19.580
The stakes have never been higher, but the challenge has also never been greater.

03:19.580 --> 03:22.240
Let's look at why.

03:22.240 --> 03:24.780
First and foremost, it's a scale problem.

03:24.780 --> 03:28.900
Shipping and administering one vaccine to one person is not difficult, but shipping

03:28.900 --> 03:33.340
and administering five billion vaccines to five billion people is.

03:33.860 --> 03:37.860
That's because there just isn't enough room in our world's logistics network, as

03:37.860 --> 03:40.020
it is now, to do that.

03:40.020 --> 03:44.620
Making it even tougher, there's more chance than not, based on the current leading vaccines,

03:44.620 --> 03:49.860
that the first major vaccine to be approved will require two doses administered 21 or

03:49.860 --> 03:51.800
28 days apart.

03:51.800 --> 03:54.060
That doubles the challenge.

03:54.060 --> 03:58.860
Distributing ten or more billion doses of a vaccine would be difficult enough in normal

03:58.860 --> 04:02.100
times, but these are far from normal times.

04:02.100 --> 04:06.840
With international travel all but non-existent, currently sitting at more than 90% down, passenger

04:06.840 --> 04:10.820
airlines have dramatically cut back their international route networks.

04:10.820 --> 04:16.020
Now, this is an issue because traditionally, some 50% of pharmaceuticals are shipped in

04:16.020 --> 04:20.740
the belly hold of passenger aircraft rather than on dedicated freighters, as this can

04:20.740 --> 04:24.280
help them get closer to their final destination faster.

04:24.280 --> 04:30.060
With limited passenger service, overall cargo capacity is down about 30% while cargo demand

04:30.060 --> 04:35.060
is only about 15% down, meaning there is already a supply crunch.

04:35.060 --> 04:39.260
This has led to existing dedicated freighter aircraft being used more, additional dedicated

04:39.260 --> 04:43.840
freighters coming into service, but still, due to constrained supply, a dramatic increase

04:43.840 --> 04:45.640
in shipping costs.

04:45.640 --> 04:50.500
Even already, before the COVID vaccine comes into the global logistics network, pharmaceutical

04:50.500 --> 04:54.580
manufacturers have had to come up with new techniques to ship their goods including,

04:54.580 --> 04:58.220
for example, flying their product to where shipping rates are cheaper and trucking them

04:58.220 --> 05:01.660
to their final destination or chartering private planes.

05:01.660 --> 05:05.740
Of course, the world already experienced a massive logistics challenge this year with

05:05.740 --> 05:09.820
the distribution of personal protective equipment, and shippers were able to scale up for that

05:09.820 --> 05:14.420
reasonably successfully, but there's one simple reason why it won't be so easy this

05:14.420 --> 05:17.900
time around—the cold chain.

05:17.900 --> 05:20.280
Vaccines are temperature sensitive.

05:20.280 --> 05:24.640
Most all of them have to be stored in a highly precise, climate-controlled environment in

05:24.640 --> 05:26.980
order to stay safe and effective.

05:26.980 --> 05:31.540
So, the cold chain is the supply chain suited to shipping goods that need to be kept cold

05:31.540 --> 05:35.220
or frozen, such as meat, chemicals, and pharmaceuticals.

05:35.220 --> 05:40.340
Of course, the difficulty with the cold chain is that everything used has to be specialized.

05:40.340 --> 05:45.060
The origin warehouse, the truck, the plane, the in-route warehouse, and the final destination

05:45.060 --> 05:48.620
each need to have the equipment to keep the goods at the specified temperature, or the

05:48.620 --> 05:52.460
goods have to be shipped in packaging that keeps them at the specified temperature.

05:52.460 --> 05:57.540
Both options are complicated, and complication compounded by other complication is what makes

05:57.540 --> 06:00.440
a true logistical challenge.

06:00.440 --> 06:02.620
It doesn't end there, though.

06:02.620 --> 06:08.540
One of the leading vaccine candidates, Pfizer's BNT162b2, must be stored and transported at

06:08.540 --> 06:12.900
around negative 90 degrees Fahrenheit or negative 68 degrees Celsius.

06:12.900 --> 06:17.940
That is far, far colder than the requirements of most vaccines, which can ship either at

06:17.940 --> 06:21.940
refrigerated temperatures or a wider range of freezing temperatures.

06:21.940 --> 06:26.520
A thermal requirement such as this is a whole different ballgame, and it means that they'll

06:26.520 --> 06:31.100
be able to use only a subset of cold chain infrastructure, which is already a subset

06:31.100 --> 06:33.620
of overall logistics infrastructure.

06:33.620 --> 06:38.020
Beyond the issue of actually getting such a vaccine to a distribution site, most hospitals

06:38.020 --> 06:42.100
don't even have facilities to keep a vaccine at such a temperature, let alone clinics or

06:42.100 --> 06:47.480
pharmacies, meaning that even finding places that can receive this vaccine is a challenge.

06:47.480 --> 06:51.920
Part of the reason why this obstacle has come up is that traditionally, vaccines are thoroughly

06:51.920 --> 06:55.940
tested to determine what sort of storage and shipping conditions they can endure while

06:55.940 --> 07:00.040
still staying safe and effective, but with the breakneck pace of development for these

07:00.040 --> 07:04.360
COVID-19 vaccines, there likely will not have been enough time to conduct these tests before

07:04.360 --> 07:08.600
distribution meaning they'll have to keep the standards at what's already proven.

07:08.600 --> 07:13.720
So, to reiterate, already, a likely vaccine will only be able to be shipped through a

07:13.720 --> 07:19.400
subset of a subset of a subset of an already strained logistics network to a subset of

07:19.400 --> 07:25.360
sites and it'll need to happen many billions of times, but even the solution to these challenges

07:25.360 --> 07:27.640
present additional challenges.

07:27.640 --> 07:32.080
Pfizer, for example, knowing that the unique distribution requirements of their vaccine

07:32.080 --> 07:36.080
could limit its commercial success, has developed a partial solution.

07:36.080 --> 07:41.320
It's essentially a highly specialized standalone box that can, with the use of dry ice, keep

07:41.320 --> 07:45.000
the vaccine at the required temperature for up to ten days.

07:45.000 --> 07:49.040
This means that, hypothetically, the vaccine could be shipped through a more traditional

07:49.040 --> 07:54.340
logistics network, however, this box has highly specific requirements.

07:54.340 --> 07:58.620
For one, upon arrival, it can only be opened twice per day, not more than one minute at

07:58.620 --> 08:02.520
a time, in order to keep the vaccines at the required temperature.

08:02.520 --> 08:06.400
That means that a distribution site would need to accurately predict how many doses

08:06.400 --> 08:09.580
they would need in a given day before that day.

08:09.580 --> 08:13.360
If they take out too little, they'd be slowing the process by not vaccinating everyone they

08:13.360 --> 08:17.680
can, but if they take out too much, they'd have potentially life-saving vaccines go to

08:17.680 --> 08:19.600
waste at the end of the day.

08:19.600 --> 08:24.280
Also, this box can only carry vaccines in multiples of a thousand, and keep in mind

08:24.280 --> 08:27.200
that it only keeps cold for ten days.

08:27.200 --> 08:31.880
So how, for example, do you go about getting the vaccine to a clinic that can only vaccinate

08:31.880 --> 08:35.720
50 people in a day, like a rural clinic in a small town?

08:35.720 --> 08:41.080
Even if shipping was instantaneous, they could only vaccinate 500 people in ten days, meaning

08:41.080 --> 08:43.440
half their vaccines would go bad.

08:43.440 --> 08:47.760
Pfizer is apparently developing a smaller temperature-controlled box to solve this problem,

08:47.760 --> 08:52.600
but that means adding a whole other type of distribution, which increases complexity,

08:52.600 --> 08:54.840
which slows the process down.

08:54.840 --> 09:00.160
In its scenario planning, the American CDC mapped out a distribution process for if both

09:00.160 --> 09:05.440
Pfizer and Moderna's vaccines are approved and, if this happened, the Pfizer vaccine

09:05.440 --> 09:09.460
would be directed to only large distribution sites that would either have the facilities

09:09.460 --> 09:13.780
for ultra-cold storage, or the capacity to vaccinate enough people that the short shelf

09:13.780 --> 09:16.540
life of these vaccines wouldn't be an issue.

09:16.540 --> 09:21.180
Then, the Moderna vaccine, which only requires traditional freezer temperatures, would be

09:21.180 --> 09:25.180
directed to smaller sites with less advanced facilities.

09:25.180 --> 09:29.500
This would certainly create a scenario in the US, and likely elsewhere, where the Pfizer

09:29.500 --> 09:33.540
vaccine would be primarily distributed to people in cities, while the Moderna vaccine

09:33.540 --> 09:36.680
would be the vaccine of choice for rural areas.

09:36.680 --> 09:41.560
Another challenge that needs to be confronted is the order of operations for distribution.

09:41.560 --> 09:45.040
The coronavirus affects different people in different ways.

09:45.040 --> 09:49.560
This means that if we want a vaccine to save the most number of lives possible, the first

09:49.560 --> 09:54.000
person in line should be that who is most susceptible to COVID-19, and the last person

09:54.000 --> 09:56.960
in line should be that who is least susceptible.

09:56.960 --> 10:01.560
One set of research modeled two scenarios—the first where, of the first three billion doses

10:01.560 --> 10:05.640
available, 50 high-income countries buy up two billion of them.

10:05.640 --> 10:09.600
The second was where the first three billion doses were distributed to countries proportionally

10:09.600 --> 10:12.680
based on their population, regardless of wealth.

10:12.680 --> 10:18.400
In this model, twice as many people died overall with the first scenario—the wealthy countries'

10:18.400 --> 10:22.080
first scenario—than the equitable, proportional approach.

10:22.080 --> 10:27.360
However, for vaccination purposes, it is the least wealthy countries—arguably those

10:27.360 --> 10:31.440
that need the vaccine most—that are toughest to distribute to.

10:31.440 --> 10:36.280
Poor countries tend to have limited cold-chain infrastructure, let alone normal logistics

10:36.280 --> 10:40.560
infrastructure, and fragmented, poorly funded healthcare systems.

10:40.560 --> 10:44.700
Distributing and administering a complex vaccine like Pfizer's will already be tough enough

10:44.700 --> 10:49.020
in the wealthy countries like the United States, but just imagine how difficult it will be

10:49.020 --> 10:53.960
to get a vaccine from distributor to someone's arm in rural Democratic Republic of the Congo,

10:53.960 --> 10:59.400
for example, in ten days while keeping it at negative 90 degrees Fahrenheit.

10:59.400 --> 11:04.960
How soon a COVID vaccine is administered will quite directly correlate to how many lives

11:04.960 --> 11:06.240
are saved.

11:06.240 --> 11:11.080
Every day of delay will, with certainty, lead to more death and despair.

11:11.080 --> 11:15.380
The manufacturers are working as fast as they can—they are already producing millions

11:15.380 --> 11:19.440
of doses of their vaccines before they're approved so they can be distributed as fast

11:19.440 --> 11:24.280
as possible, and regulatory agencies have been preparing for months for an unprecedentedly

11:24.280 --> 11:31.040
fast review process, so it is now truly down to every member of the global logistics network

11:31.040 --> 11:33.160
to save lives.

11:33.160 --> 11:38.880
Of course, many of those that will be involved, especially once we get to wide-scale distribution,

11:38.880 --> 11:44.600
will be companies, not governments or non-profits, and for them, this presents a massive business

11:44.600 --> 11:48.640
opportunity in addition to the positive public relations potential.

11:48.640 --> 11:53.920
UPS, for example, has built two freezer farms in Louisville, Kentucky and Venlo, Netherlands,

11:53.920 --> 11:58.120
for their hubs, which can each hold 48,000 doses and can go down to the temperatures

11:58.120 --> 11:59.840
required for the Pfizer vaccine.

11:59.840 --> 12:04.520
DHL and FedEx, too, are reportedly massively upscaling their cold-chain infrastructure

12:04.520 --> 12:08.380
to be able to handle some of the surge in demand, while other lesser-known logistics

12:08.380 --> 12:10.120
companies are, too.

12:10.120 --> 12:15.480
Ultimately, though, it's tough to find someone in the know who doesn't admit that shipping

12:15.480 --> 12:17.760
will be a bottleneck.

12:17.760 --> 12:22.680
We already know it's not going to go perfectly, so right now, it's about doing as much work

12:22.680 --> 12:27.000
as possible to make sure the process goes as well as it can be.

12:27.000 --> 12:31.160
This will come down to making sure that as much planning work as possible is done now,

12:31.160 --> 12:36.520
before the vaccine is approved, so that distribution can happen as fast as possible when that does

12:36.520 --> 12:37.520
happen.

12:37.520 --> 12:42.480
Now is the time to figure out how and where the vaccine will be distributed.

12:42.480 --> 12:47.980
If you are a healthy, relatively young person and thinking selfishly, you should care tremendously

12:47.980 --> 12:53.060
about the distribution process, because you are at the back of the line.

12:53.060 --> 12:57.580
When you get your shot, when you get to start letting your guard down, has everything to

12:57.580 --> 13:02.980
do with how fast everyone in front of you gets theirs, and how fast they get theirs

13:02.980 --> 13:06.380
will also impact how many of them will die.

13:06.380 --> 13:10.060
We know this process will not be perfect, and it wouldn't be reasonable to ask for

13:10.060 --> 13:15.760
perfect given the complexity of the challenge, but if we truly put every effort into planning

13:15.760 --> 13:21.800
and preparing for this now and create a system that orders people by need, rather than wealth,

13:21.800 --> 13:27.000
we can at least know, at the end of this, that no lives could have been saved if only

13:27.000 --> 13:29.920
the vaccine got to them faster.

13:29.920 --> 13:34.400
For our collective consciousness, looking back far in the future, this moment will be

13:34.400 --> 13:40.240
defined not by when we get to go back to concerts, or parties, or the gym, but rather by how

13:40.240 --> 13:45.480
many lives we saved when confronting, what is hopefully, the greatest global challenge

13:45.480 --> 13:49.120
of this generation.

13:49.120 --> 13:53.500
As you've heard before, the point of Nebula, the streaming site that I and other independent

13:53.500 --> 13:58.340
creators founded, is to make a greater variety of content types possible.

13:58.340 --> 14:02.160
For example, I know many of you were fans of my and Brian from Real Engineering's

14:02.160 --> 14:06.560
old podcast, Showmakers, where we interviewed different educational creators about their

14:06.560 --> 14:11.400
background, story, and process, but the financials of that show just didn't work, so we stopped

14:11.400 --> 14:12.400
it.

14:12.400 --> 14:16.960
Nebula, however, has made it possible for us to relaunch it, so we've done exactly

14:16.960 --> 14:22.160
that—Showmakers is now a Nebula Original Podcast.

14:22.160 --> 14:26.640
This is in addition to the two Wendover Originals we've done already, the Half as Interesting

14:26.640 --> 14:30.080
Original, and another Wendover Original that is coming out next month.

14:30.080 --> 14:34.360
Of course, the best way to get access to Nebula is CuriosityStream's bundle deal, on sale

14:34.360 --> 14:36.940
now for $15 a year.

14:36.940 --> 14:41.380
With that, you also get access to CuriosityStream, where you could watch, for example, the piece

14:41.380 --> 14:45.520
they made about how the development of the COVID vaccine works, filmed with the actual

14:45.520 --> 14:46.840
scientists involved.

14:46.840 --> 14:51.240
That's, of course, in addition to the thousands of other educational shows and documentaries

14:51.240 --> 14:57.120
