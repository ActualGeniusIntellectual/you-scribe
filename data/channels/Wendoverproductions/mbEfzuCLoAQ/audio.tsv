0	3640	Let's face it, trains kinda suck in America.
3640	8380	They're slow, expensive, and just don't exist in many parts of the country.
8380	12280	The simple reason for this is because the US is so sparsely populated.
12280	17040	Aside from here, here, and here, cities just aren't close enough together to make train
17040	20040	travel faster or cheaper than plane travel.
20040	23920	When cities are within 200 to 300 miles of each other, it's often faster to take a
23920	28720	train from downtown to downtown rather than driving to an airport, checking in, going
28720	31400	through security, flying, than driving downtown.
31400	35900	However, as I mentioned, there definitely are regions in the US with cities this distance
35900	38800	away from each other, so why do trains still suck?
38800	43160	The United States has the geography to support trains in certain areas and yet a train from
43160	49540	DC to New York costs at least $49 and takes 3 hours and 29 minutes, only 30 minutes less
49540	50540	than driving.
50540	55980	A train from Rennes to Paris, France, a very similar distance, costs 27 euros, the equivalent
55980	59780	of $30, and takes only 2 hours and 4 minutes.
59780	65020	The US does have one high speed train, the Acela Express, but it costs at least $120
65020	69380	for a ride from DC to New York and still takes 2 hours and 50 minutes.
69380	74700	Turkey, Poland, and Uzbekistan all have trains that travel faster than America's fastest
74700	75700	train.
75700	79560	Alright, so understanding the whole issue requires a bit of background knowledge.
79560	83660	Back in their heyday, railroads in America were… amazing.
83660	90800	We built our first in 1826 and had a transcontinental line by 1869, only 19 years after California
90800	92480	even became a state.
92480	97020	Trains traveled almost everywhere and most historians agree that the development of railroads
97020	102520	was an absolutely crucial catalyst to the American industrialization period from 1843
102520	103520	to 1860.
103520	108040	They even prompted the US to create one of the world's first standardized time systems
108040	111560	as discussed in an old video of mine which you can find here.
111560	115060	While passenger trains could sometimes be profitable, freight services were where the
115060	116280	real money was.
116280	120540	So most rail companies basically ran passenger services as a mobile advertisement for their
120540	124640	freight services to the executives that would decide which company to ship goods on.
124640	128180	Trains were, after all, the most glamorous and efficient way to travel.
128180	132820	However, as cars became popular in the 30s and planes became popular in the 50s, there
132820	136940	was little purpose anymore to set up passenger services as advertisements to executives who
136940	140000	would be taking the more trendy car or plane instead.
140000	143880	At this point, the few profitable passenger services only made money because of their
143880	146540	contracts with the US postal service.
146540	150320	Most trains would have one car that served as the railroad post office, an office on
150320	154660	wheels where workers would sort letters in route to the destination to save time.
154660	159420	In the 1960s, mail sorting was mechanized, trucks and planes began to transport letters,
159420	162100	and railroad post offices were discontinued.
162100	165600	It became essentially impossible to make money with a passenger railroad.
165600	169960	By the end of the 1960s, the only thing keeping the few passenger routes alive was illegal
169960	174000	obligation by the Interstate Commerce Commission for the train companies to keep running those
174000	175000	routes.
175000	176740	But then Amtrak came along.
176740	181540	In 1970, President Nixon signed into law the Rail Passenger Service Act which formed the
181540	186160	federally funded National Rail Company that promised to save and make great again passenger
186160	187760	rail travel.
187760	189040	Except it didn't.
189040	195240	In the United States, a nation of 319 million people, Amtrak operates a mere 300 train journeys
195240	196240	a day.
196240	202200	While in France, a nation of 66 million people, the Société Nationale de Chemin de Fer français,
202200	209440	also known as SNCF, operates 14,000 trips every single day, 800 of which are high speed.
209440	212520	One common criticism of Amtrak is its unreliability.
212520	216600	On average, only 72% of Amtrak's trains arrive on time.
216600	221040	The California-Zephyr route from Chicago to San Francisco even arrived on time a paltry
221040	224840	31% in June of 2016.
224840	227080	So what does Amtrak blame the delays on?
227080	228120	Freight trains.
228120	234600	You see, Amtrak only owns 730 miles of the 21,300 miles of track it operates on.
234600	239240	On the California-Zephyr route, Union Pacific owns about half the track and BNSF owns the
239240	240320	other half.
240320	244900	According to Amtrak, only 1.4% of all delays on this route were their fault.
244900	249800	The other 98.6% were reportedly the fault of the rail companies who owned the track.
249800	254640	BNSF will naturally lend priority to their own trains on their tracks instead of Amtrak's
254640	258040	so Amtrak trains are often told to wait to let a freight train pass.
258040	262220	After all, it's not like Amtrak can go and use competing tracks so there's little incentive
262220	264480	to give priority to passenger trains.
264480	267200	Most rail operators in Europe don't have this problem.
267200	271480	In France, for example, the National Rail Company owns all the track so priority can
271480	273200	be given to passenger trains.
273200	279320	Also, only 8% of freight in Europe is moved by rail compared to 38% in the United States
279320	282320	so there are far fewer freight trains congesting the tracks.
282320	286020	Since Amtrak is so young, they never got the opportunity to build their own tracks.
286020	289620	The Northeast Corridor, which is absolutely perfectly shaped to have a high-speed rail
289620	294240	network with five major urban centers located on a straight line, built up its rail system
294240	298640	in the 1800s and the railroad had such an impact that towns and people flocked to the
298640	299780	area around it.
299780	304480	For that reason, this area is incredibly densely populated and there truly is no open space
304480	305720	between the cities.
305720	309880	Consequentially, it would be unbelievably expensive to raze a bunch of houses and build
309880	313360	a new, straighter route of high-speed tracks from DC to New York.
313360	318240	Amtrak says it would cost an estimated $151 billion dollars to build tracks up to the
318240	321760	spec of France's high-speed rail network in the Northeast Corridor.
321760	325720	Since the Northeast Regional, the train running between DC, Baltimore, Philadelphia, New York
325720	329320	and Boston, is one of the few routes that makes money, there's little incentive for
329320	332520	Amtrak to sink a lot of funds into upgrading the tracks.
332520	336600	Additionally, American cities just aren't built like many European cities.
336640	341160	With population densities averaging lower than 15,000 people per square mile, cities
341160	345040	in the United States are far less walkable than their European counterparts which can
345040	348320	have as many as 55,000 people per square mile.
348320	353240	Due to their ancient roots, European cities naturally develop compact urban cores since
353240	356760	for all but the rich there was no option but to walk everywhere.
356760	360260	Given that, it's much easier to walk to your destination from a train station in a
360260	362800	European city than it is in an American city.
362800	366320	It's believed that since most Americans have to take another form of transport to
366360	370240	get to their destination after taking the train in America, they see the train as not
370240	374220	that much more convenient than the plane where you also have to take another form of transport
374220	376080	to get to your final destination.
376080	377400	So what's the solution?
377400	379080	How should America fix its rails?
379080	382960	Well, unfortunately, we'll probably never get a big network of fancy high-speed lines
382960	384600	like in France or Germany.
384600	388640	There are dozens of plans in the US to build high-speed rail lines, however, few of them
388640	390460	will likely come to fruition.
390460	394260	There is a high-speed rail line currently being built between Miami and Orlando by a
394300	396460	private company called All Aboard Florida.
396460	401060	However, with a top speed of 125 miles per hour, the service will only be slightly faster
401060	404300	than driving due to speed restrictions on many parts of the route.
404300	408040	The state of California is also building a high-speed rail line between San Francisco
408040	412460	and Anaheim with an estimated transit time of 2 hours and 40 minutes, which would be
412460	415220	less than half the driving time between the two cities.
415220	418820	Despite construction already beginning, phase one of the project isn't estimated to be
418820	423060	completed until 2029 and public support is diminishing.
423060	426580	Many have proposed that America shouldn't be concerned with building a flashy high-speed
426580	427580	network.
427580	432740	Amtrak's $151 billion proposal for a true high-speed Northeast Corridor system divides
432740	439260	down to $320 million per mile or $60,000 per foot of high-speed track.
439260	442940	What would be far more efficient would be to upgrade current track to allow trains to
442940	444760	operate at their top speeds.
444760	449740	On the Northeast Regional Route, trains reach a top speed of 125 miles per hour briefly,
449740	453460	and if they operated at that speed for all of the DC to New York leg, the trip would
453460	455920	take only slightly longer than 2 hours.
455920	459660	Small improvements can cut minutes from the journey time, which can add up to hours.
459660	463720	Unfortunately, Amtrak is stuck in a rut where they have no money to improve anything, which
463720	467420	causes low ridership which worsens the problem of no money.
467420	472340	SNCF in France is so great because taxpayers pay for about half of the operating cost of
472340	476620	every journey, while Amtrak is designed to be a for-profit yet government-subsidized
476620	477900	corporation.
477900	481980	Right now, Amtrak is kind of like the neglected little brother in the U.S. transit family
481980	486140	who doesn't get any money, and until that changes, we're still going to have our slow,
486140	488020	expensive trains.
