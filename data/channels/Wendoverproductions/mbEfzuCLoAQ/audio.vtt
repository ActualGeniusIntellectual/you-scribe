00:00.000 --> 00:03.640
Let's face it, trains kinda suck in America.

00:03.640 --> 00:08.380
They're slow, expensive, and just don't exist in many parts of the country.

00:08.380 --> 00:12.280
The simple reason for this is because the US is so sparsely populated.

00:12.280 --> 00:17.040
Aside from here, here, and here, cities just aren't close enough together to make train

00:17.040 --> 00:20.040
travel faster or cheaper than plane travel.

00:20.040 --> 00:23.920
When cities are within 200 to 300 miles of each other, it's often faster to take a

00:23.920 --> 00:28.720
train from downtown to downtown rather than driving to an airport, checking in, going

00:28.720 --> 00:31.400
through security, flying, than driving downtown.

00:31.400 --> 00:35.900
However, as I mentioned, there definitely are regions in the US with cities this distance

00:35.900 --> 00:38.800
away from each other, so why do trains still suck?

00:38.800 --> 00:43.160
The United States has the geography to support trains in certain areas and yet a train from

00:43.160 --> 00:49.540
DC to New York costs at least $49 and takes 3 hours and 29 minutes, only 30 minutes less

00:49.540 --> 00:50.540
than driving.

00:50.540 --> 00:55.980
A train from Rennes to Paris, France, a very similar distance, costs 27 euros, the equivalent

00:55.980 --> 00:59.780
of $30, and takes only 2 hours and 4 minutes.

00:59.780 --> 01:05.020
The US does have one high speed train, the Acela Express, but it costs at least $120

01:05.020 --> 01:09.380
for a ride from DC to New York and still takes 2 hours and 50 minutes.

01:09.380 --> 01:14.700
Turkey, Poland, and Uzbekistan all have trains that travel faster than America's fastest

01:14.700 --> 01:15.700
train.

01:15.700 --> 01:19.560
Alright, so understanding the whole issue requires a bit of background knowledge.

01:19.560 --> 01:23.660
Back in their heyday, railroads in America were… amazing.

01:23.660 --> 01:30.800
We built our first in 1826 and had a transcontinental line by 1869, only 19 years after California

01:30.800 --> 01:32.480
even became a state.

01:32.480 --> 01:37.020
Trains traveled almost everywhere and most historians agree that the development of railroads

01:37.020 --> 01:42.520
was an absolutely crucial catalyst to the American industrialization period from 1843

01:42.520 --> 01:43.520
to 1860.

01:43.520 --> 01:48.040
They even prompted the US to create one of the world's first standardized time systems

01:48.040 --> 01:51.560
as discussed in an old video of mine which you can find here.

01:51.560 --> 01:55.060
While passenger trains could sometimes be profitable, freight services were where the

01:55.060 --> 01:56.280
real money was.

01:56.280 --> 02:00.540
So most rail companies basically ran passenger services as a mobile advertisement for their

02:00.540 --> 02:04.640
freight services to the executives that would decide which company to ship goods on.

02:04.640 --> 02:08.180
Trains were, after all, the most glamorous and efficient way to travel.

02:08.180 --> 02:12.820
However, as cars became popular in the 30s and planes became popular in the 50s, there

02:12.820 --> 02:16.940
was little purpose anymore to set up passenger services as advertisements to executives who

02:16.940 --> 02:20.000
would be taking the more trendy car or plane instead.

02:20.000 --> 02:23.880
At this point, the few profitable passenger services only made money because of their

02:23.880 --> 02:26.540
contracts with the US postal service.

02:26.540 --> 02:30.320
Most trains would have one car that served as the railroad post office, an office on

02:30.320 --> 02:34.660
wheels where workers would sort letters in route to the destination to save time.

02:34.660 --> 02:39.420
In the 1960s, mail sorting was mechanized, trucks and planes began to transport letters,

02:39.420 --> 02:42.100
and railroad post offices were discontinued.

02:42.100 --> 02:45.600
It became essentially impossible to make money with a passenger railroad.

02:45.600 --> 02:49.960
By the end of the 1960s, the only thing keeping the few passenger routes alive was illegal

02:49.960 --> 02:54.000
obligation by the Interstate Commerce Commission for the train companies to keep running those

02:54.000 --> 02:55.000
routes.

02:55.000 --> 02:56.740
But then Amtrak came along.

02:56.740 --> 03:01.540
In 1970, President Nixon signed into law the Rail Passenger Service Act which formed the

03:01.540 --> 03:06.160
federally funded National Rail Company that promised to save and make great again passenger

03:06.160 --> 03:07.760
rail travel.

03:07.760 --> 03:09.040
Except it didn't.

03:09.040 --> 03:15.240
In the United States, a nation of 319 million people, Amtrak operates a mere 300 train journeys

03:15.240 --> 03:16.240
a day.

03:16.240 --> 03:22.200
While in France, a nation of 66 million people, the Société Nationale de Chemin de Fer français,

03:22.200 --> 03:29.440
also known as SNCF, operates 14,000 trips every single day, 800 of which are high speed.

03:29.440 --> 03:32.520
One common criticism of Amtrak is its unreliability.

03:32.520 --> 03:36.600
On average, only 72% of Amtrak's trains arrive on time.

03:36.600 --> 03:41.040
The California-Zephyr route from Chicago to San Francisco even arrived on time a paltry

03:41.040 --> 03:44.840
31% in June of 2016.

03:44.840 --> 03:47.080
So what does Amtrak blame the delays on?

03:47.080 --> 03:48.120
Freight trains.

03:48.120 --> 03:54.600
You see, Amtrak only owns 730 miles of the 21,300 miles of track it operates on.

03:54.600 --> 03:59.240
On the California-Zephyr route, Union Pacific owns about half the track and BNSF owns the

03:59.240 --> 04:00.320
other half.

04:00.320 --> 04:04.900
According to Amtrak, only 1.4% of all delays on this route were their fault.

04:04.900 --> 04:09.800
The other 98.6% were reportedly the fault of the rail companies who owned the track.

04:09.800 --> 04:14.640
BNSF will naturally lend priority to their own trains on their tracks instead of Amtrak's

04:14.640 --> 04:18.040
so Amtrak trains are often told to wait to let a freight train pass.

04:18.040 --> 04:22.220
After all, it's not like Amtrak can go and use competing tracks so there's little incentive

04:22.220 --> 04:24.480
to give priority to passenger trains.

04:24.480 --> 04:27.200
Most rail operators in Europe don't have this problem.

04:27.200 --> 04:31.480
In France, for example, the National Rail Company owns all the track so priority can

04:31.480 --> 04:33.200
be given to passenger trains.

04:33.200 --> 04:39.320
Also, only 8% of freight in Europe is moved by rail compared to 38% in the United States

04:39.320 --> 04:42.320
so there are far fewer freight trains congesting the tracks.

04:42.320 --> 04:46.020
Since Amtrak is so young, they never got the opportunity to build their own tracks.

04:46.020 --> 04:49.620
The Northeast Corridor, which is absolutely perfectly shaped to have a high-speed rail

04:49.620 --> 04:54.240
network with five major urban centers located on a straight line, built up its rail system

04:54.240 --> 04:58.640
in the 1800s and the railroad had such an impact that towns and people flocked to the

04:58.640 --> 04:59.780
area around it.

04:59.780 --> 05:04.480
For that reason, this area is incredibly densely populated and there truly is no open space

05:04.480 --> 05:05.720
between the cities.

05:05.720 --> 05:09.880
Consequentially, it would be unbelievably expensive to raze a bunch of houses and build

05:09.880 --> 05:13.360
a new, straighter route of high-speed tracks from DC to New York.

05:13.360 --> 05:18.240
Amtrak says it would cost an estimated $151 billion dollars to build tracks up to the

05:18.240 --> 05:21.760
spec of France's high-speed rail network in the Northeast Corridor.

05:21.760 --> 05:25.720
Since the Northeast Regional, the train running between DC, Baltimore, Philadelphia, New York

05:25.720 --> 05:29.320
and Boston, is one of the few routes that makes money, there's little incentive for

05:29.320 --> 05:32.520
Amtrak to sink a lot of funds into upgrading the tracks.

05:32.520 --> 05:36.600
Additionally, American cities just aren't built like many European cities.

05:36.640 --> 05:41.160
With population densities averaging lower than 15,000 people per square mile, cities

05:41.160 --> 05:45.040
in the United States are far less walkable than their European counterparts which can

05:45.040 --> 05:48.320
have as many as 55,000 people per square mile.

05:48.320 --> 05:53.240
Due to their ancient roots, European cities naturally develop compact urban cores since

05:53.240 --> 05:56.760
for all but the rich there was no option but to walk everywhere.

05:56.760 --> 06:00.260
Given that, it's much easier to walk to your destination from a train station in a

06:00.260 --> 06:02.800
European city than it is in an American city.

06:02.800 --> 06:06.320
It's believed that since most Americans have to take another form of transport to

06:06.360 --> 06:10.240
get to their destination after taking the train in America, they see the train as not

06:10.240 --> 06:14.220
that much more convenient than the plane where you also have to take another form of transport

06:14.220 --> 06:16.080
to get to your final destination.

06:16.080 --> 06:17.400
So what's the solution?

06:17.400 --> 06:19.080
How should America fix its rails?

06:19.080 --> 06:22.960
Well, unfortunately, we'll probably never get a big network of fancy high-speed lines

06:22.960 --> 06:24.600
like in France or Germany.

06:24.600 --> 06:28.640
There are dozens of plans in the US to build high-speed rail lines, however, few of them

06:28.640 --> 06:30.460
will likely come to fruition.

06:30.460 --> 06:34.260
There is a high-speed rail line currently being built between Miami and Orlando by a

06:34.300 --> 06:36.460
private company called All Aboard Florida.

06:36.460 --> 06:41.060
However, with a top speed of 125 miles per hour, the service will only be slightly faster

06:41.060 --> 06:44.300
than driving due to speed restrictions on many parts of the route.

06:44.300 --> 06:48.040
The state of California is also building a high-speed rail line between San Francisco

06:48.040 --> 06:52.460
and Anaheim with an estimated transit time of 2 hours and 40 minutes, which would be

06:52.460 --> 06:55.220
less than half the driving time between the two cities.

06:55.220 --> 06:58.820
Despite construction already beginning, phase one of the project isn't estimated to be

06:58.820 --> 07:03.060
completed until 2029 and public support is diminishing.

07:03.060 --> 07:06.580
Many have proposed that America shouldn't be concerned with building a flashy high-speed

07:06.580 --> 07:07.580
network.

07:07.580 --> 07:12.740
Amtrak's $151 billion proposal for a true high-speed Northeast Corridor system divides

07:12.740 --> 07:19.260
down to $320 million per mile or $60,000 per foot of high-speed track.

07:19.260 --> 07:22.940
What would be far more efficient would be to upgrade current track to allow trains to

07:22.940 --> 07:24.760
operate at their top speeds.

07:24.760 --> 07:29.740
On the Northeast Regional Route, trains reach a top speed of 125 miles per hour briefly,

07:29.740 --> 07:33.460
and if they operated at that speed for all of the DC to New York leg, the trip would

07:33.460 --> 07:35.920
take only slightly longer than 2 hours.

07:35.920 --> 07:39.660
Small improvements can cut minutes from the journey time, which can add up to hours.

07:39.660 --> 07:43.720
Unfortunately, Amtrak is stuck in a rut where they have no money to improve anything, which

07:43.720 --> 07:47.420
causes low ridership which worsens the problem of no money.

07:47.420 --> 07:52.340
SNCF in France is so great because taxpayers pay for about half of the operating cost of

07:52.340 --> 07:56.620
every journey, while Amtrak is designed to be a for-profit yet government-subsidized

07:56.620 --> 07:57.900
corporation.

07:57.900 --> 08:01.980
Right now, Amtrak is kind of like the neglected little brother in the U.S. transit family

08:01.980 --> 08:06.140
who doesn't get any money, and until that changes, we're still going to have our slow,

08:06.140 --> 08:08.020
expensive trains.
