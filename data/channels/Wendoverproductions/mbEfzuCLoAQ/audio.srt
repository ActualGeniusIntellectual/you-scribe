1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,640
Let's face it, trains kinda suck in America.

2
00:00:03,640 --> 00:00:08,380
They're slow, expensive, and just don't exist in many parts of the country.

3
00:00:08,380 --> 00:00:12,280
The simple reason for this is because the US is so sparsely populated.

4
00:00:12,280 --> 00:00:17,040
Aside from here, here, and here, cities just aren't close enough together to make train

5
00:00:17,040 --> 00:00:20,040
travel faster or cheaper than plane travel.

6
00:00:20,040 --> 00:00:23,920
When cities are within 200 to 300 miles of each other, it's often faster to take a

7
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:28,720
train from downtown to downtown rather than driving to an airport, checking in, going

8
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:31,400
through security, flying, than driving downtown.

9
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:35,900
However, as I mentioned, there definitely are regions in the US with cities this distance

10
00:00:35,900 --> 00:00:38,800
away from each other, so why do trains still suck?

11
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:43,160
The United States has the geography to support trains in certain areas and yet a train from

12
00:00:43,160 --> 00:00:49,540
DC to New York costs at least $49 and takes 3 hours and 29 minutes, only 30 minutes less

13
00:00:49,540 --> 00:00:50,540
than driving.

14
00:00:50,540 --> 00:00:55,980
A train from Rennes to Paris, France, a very similar distance, costs 27 euros, the equivalent

15
00:00:55,980 --> 00:00:59,780
of $30, and takes only 2 hours and 4 minutes.

16
00:00:59,780 --> 00:01:05,020
The US does have one high speed train, the Acela Express, but it costs at least $120

17
00:01:05,020 --> 00:01:09,380
for a ride from DC to New York and still takes 2 hours and 50 minutes.

18
00:01:09,380 --> 00:01:14,700
Turkey, Poland, and Uzbekistan all have trains that travel faster than America's fastest

19
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:15,700
train.

20
00:01:15,700 --> 00:01:19,560
Alright, so understanding the whole issue requires a bit of background knowledge.

21
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:23,660
Back in their heyday, railroads in America were… amazing.

22
00:01:23,660 --> 00:01:30,800
We built our first in 1826 and had a transcontinental line by 1869, only 19 years after California

23
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:32,480
even became a state.

24
00:01:32,480 --> 00:01:37,020
Trains traveled almost everywhere and most historians agree that the development of railroads

25
00:01:37,020 --> 00:01:42,520
was an absolutely crucial catalyst to the American industrialization period from 1843

26
00:01:42,520 --> 00:01:43,520
to 1860.

27
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:48,040
They even prompted the US to create one of the world's first standardized time systems

28
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:51,560
as discussed in an old video of mine which you can find here.

29
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:55,060
While passenger trains could sometimes be profitable, freight services were where the

30
00:01:55,060 --> 00:01:56,280
real money was.

31
00:01:56,280 --> 00:02:00,540
So most rail companies basically ran passenger services as a mobile advertisement for their

32
00:02:00,540 --> 00:02:04,640
freight services to the executives that would decide which company to ship goods on.

33
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:08,180
Trains were, after all, the most glamorous and efficient way to travel.

34
00:02:08,180 --> 00:02:12,820
However, as cars became popular in the 30s and planes became popular in the 50s, there

35
00:02:12,820 --> 00:02:16,940
was little purpose anymore to set up passenger services as advertisements to executives who

36
00:02:16,940 --> 00:02:20,000
would be taking the more trendy car or plane instead.

37
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,880
At this point, the few profitable passenger services only made money because of their

38
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:26,540
contracts with the US postal service.

39
00:02:26,540 --> 00:02:30,320
Most trains would have one car that served as the railroad post office, an office on

40
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:34,660
wheels where workers would sort letters in route to the destination to save time.

41
00:02:34,660 --> 00:02:39,420
In the 1960s, mail sorting was mechanized, trucks and planes began to transport letters,

42
00:02:39,420 --> 00:02:42,100
and railroad post offices were discontinued.

43
00:02:42,100 --> 00:02:45,600
It became essentially impossible to make money with a passenger railroad.

44
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:49,960
By the end of the 1960s, the only thing keeping the few passenger routes alive was illegal

45
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:54,000
obligation by the Interstate Commerce Commission for the train companies to keep running those

46
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
routes.

47
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,740
But then Amtrak came along.

48
00:02:56,740 --> 00:03:01,540
In 1970, President Nixon signed into law the Rail Passenger Service Act which formed the

49
00:03:01,540 --> 00:03:06,160
federally funded National Rail Company that promised to save and make great again passenger

50
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:07,760
rail travel.

51
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:09,040
Except it didn't.

52
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:15,240
In the United States, a nation of 319 million people, Amtrak operates a mere 300 train journeys

53
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:16,240
a day.

54
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:22,200
While in France, a nation of 66 million people, the Société Nationale de Chemin de Fer français,

55
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:29,440
also known as SNCF, operates 14,000 trips every single day, 800 of which are high speed.

56
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:32,520
One common criticism of Amtrak is its unreliability.

57
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:36,600
On average, only 72% of Amtrak's trains arrive on time.

58
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:41,040
The California-Zephyr route from Chicago to San Francisco even arrived on time a paltry

59
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:44,840
31% in June of 2016.

60
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:47,080
So what does Amtrak blame the delays on?

61
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:48,120
Freight trains.

62
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:54,600
You see, Amtrak only owns 730 miles of the 21,300 miles of track it operates on.

63
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:59,240
On the California-Zephyr route, Union Pacific owns about half the track and BNSF owns the

64
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:00,320
other half.

65
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:04,900
According to Amtrak, only 1.4% of all delays on this route were their fault.

66
00:04:04,900 --> 00:04:09,800
The other 98.6% were reportedly the fault of the rail companies who owned the track.

67
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:14,640
BNSF will naturally lend priority to their own trains on their tracks instead of Amtrak's

68
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:18,040
so Amtrak trains are often told to wait to let a freight train pass.

69
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:22,220
After all, it's not like Amtrak can go and use competing tracks so there's little incentive

70
00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:24,480
to give priority to passenger trains.

71
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:27,200
Most rail operators in Europe don't have this problem.

72
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:31,480
In France, for example, the National Rail Company owns all the track so priority can

73
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:33,200
be given to passenger trains.

74
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:39,320
Also, only 8% of freight in Europe is moved by rail compared to 38% in the United States

75
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:42,320
so there are far fewer freight trains congesting the tracks.

76
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:46,020
Since Amtrak is so young, they never got the opportunity to build their own tracks.

77
00:04:46,020 --> 00:04:49,620
The Northeast Corridor, which is absolutely perfectly shaped to have a high-speed rail

78
00:04:49,620 --> 00:04:54,240
network with five major urban centers located on a straight line, built up its rail system

79
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:58,640
in the 1800s and the railroad had such an impact that towns and people flocked to the

80
00:04:58,640 --> 00:04:59,780
area around it.

81
00:04:59,780 --> 00:05:04,480
For that reason, this area is incredibly densely populated and there truly is no open space

82
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:05,720
between the cities.

83
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:09,880
Consequentially, it would be unbelievably expensive to raze a bunch of houses and build

84
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:13,360
a new, straighter route of high-speed tracks from DC to New York.

85
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:18,240
Amtrak says it would cost an estimated $151 billion dollars to build tracks up to the

86
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:21,760
spec of France's high-speed rail network in the Northeast Corridor.

87
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:25,720
Since the Northeast Regional, the train running between DC, Baltimore, Philadelphia, New York

88
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:29,320
and Boston, is one of the few routes that makes money, there's little incentive for

89
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:32,520
Amtrak to sink a lot of funds into upgrading the tracks.

90
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:36,600
Additionally, American cities just aren't built like many European cities.

91
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:41,160
With population densities averaging lower than 15,000 people per square mile, cities

92
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:45,040
in the United States are far less walkable than their European counterparts which can

93
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:48,320
have as many as 55,000 people per square mile.

94
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:53,240
Due to their ancient roots, European cities naturally develop compact urban cores since

95
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:56,760
for all but the rich there was no option but to walk everywhere.

96
00:05:56,760 --> 00:06:00,260
Given that, it's much easier to walk to your destination from a train station in a

97
00:06:00,260 --> 00:06:02,800
European city than it is in an American city.

98
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:06,320
It's believed that since most Americans have to take another form of transport to

99
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:10,240
get to their destination after taking the train in America, they see the train as not

100
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:14,220
that much more convenient than the plane where you also have to take another form of transport

101
00:06:14,220 --> 00:06:16,080
to get to your final destination.

102
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:17,400
So what's the solution?

103
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:19,080
How should America fix its rails?

104
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:22,960
Well, unfortunately, we'll probably never get a big network of fancy high-speed lines

105
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:24,600
like in France or Germany.

106
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:28,640
There are dozens of plans in the US to build high-speed rail lines, however, few of them

107
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:30,460
will likely come to fruition.

108
00:06:30,460 --> 00:06:34,260
There is a high-speed rail line currently being built between Miami and Orlando by a

109
00:06:34,300 --> 00:06:36,460
private company called All Aboard Florida.

110
00:06:36,460 --> 00:06:41,060
However, with a top speed of 125 miles per hour, the service will only be slightly faster

111
00:06:41,060 --> 00:06:44,300
than driving due to speed restrictions on many parts of the route.

112
00:06:44,300 --> 00:06:48,040
The state of California is also building a high-speed rail line between San Francisco

113
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:52,460
and Anaheim with an estimated transit time of 2 hours and 40 minutes, which would be

114
00:06:52,460 --> 00:06:55,220
less than half the driving time between the two cities.

115
00:06:55,220 --> 00:06:58,820
Despite construction already beginning, phase one of the project isn't estimated to be

116
00:06:58,820 --> 00:07:03,060
completed until 2029 and public support is diminishing.

117
00:07:03,060 --> 00:07:06,580
Many have proposed that America shouldn't be concerned with building a flashy high-speed

118
00:07:06,580 --> 00:07:07,580
network.

119
00:07:07,580 --> 00:07:12,740
Amtrak's $151 billion proposal for a true high-speed Northeast Corridor system divides

120
00:07:12,740 --> 00:07:19,260
down to $320 million per mile or $60,000 per foot of high-speed track.

121
00:07:19,260 --> 00:07:22,940
What would be far more efficient would be to upgrade current track to allow trains to

122
00:07:22,940 --> 00:07:24,760
operate at their top speeds.

123
00:07:24,760 --> 00:07:29,740
On the Northeast Regional Route, trains reach a top speed of 125 miles per hour briefly,

124
00:07:29,740 --> 00:07:33,460
and if they operated at that speed for all of the DC to New York leg, the trip would

125
00:07:33,460 --> 00:07:35,920
take only slightly longer than 2 hours.

126
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:39,660
Small improvements can cut minutes from the journey time, which can add up to hours.

127
00:07:39,660 --> 00:07:43,720
Unfortunately, Amtrak is stuck in a rut where they have no money to improve anything, which

128
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:47,420
causes low ridership which worsens the problem of no money.

129
00:07:47,420 --> 00:07:52,340
SNCF in France is so great because taxpayers pay for about half of the operating cost of

130
00:07:52,340 --> 00:07:56,620
every journey, while Amtrak is designed to be a for-profit yet government-subsidized

131
00:07:56,620 --> 00:07:57,900
corporation.

132
00:07:57,900 --> 00:08:01,980
Right now, Amtrak is kind of like the neglected little brother in the U.S. transit family

133
00:08:01,980 --> 00:08:06,140
who doesn't get any money, and until that changes, we're still going to have our slow,

134
00:08:06,140 --> 00:08:08,020
expensive trains.

135
00:08:08,020 --> 00:08:09,220
