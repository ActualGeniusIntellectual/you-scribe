1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,120
Welcome to our year-end review, part two.

2
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:06,040
If you're tuning in for the first time, this is a special episode during which we

3
00:00:06,040 --> 00:00:09,440
give you one headline from every country in the world from the past year.

4
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:13,440
The caveat is, hopefully, it's a headline you hadn't heard and has little to do with

5
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:14,440
the C-word.

6
00:00:14,440 --> 00:00:18,640
We did this last year and we organized countries by population size, counting down from largest

7
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:19,720
to smallest.

8
00:00:19,720 --> 00:00:23,480
This year, we are doing a count-up organized by the Human Development Index, which is a

9
00:00:23,480 --> 00:00:27,520
number between zero and one determined by the United Nations, based on a series of metrics

10
00:00:27,520 --> 00:00:30,160
including education, longevity, and earnings.

11
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:33,880
We are halfway through the list and will end with a country that has the highest HDI in

12
00:00:33,880 --> 00:00:34,880
the world.

13
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:38,560
If you haven't watched part one, we suggest you do that too, where we explain the HDI

14
00:00:38,560 --> 00:00:39,560
breakdown in detail.

15
00:00:39,560 --> 00:00:43,160
If you're joining for part two, thanks, because it means you like part one.

16
00:00:43,160 --> 00:00:45,560
Without delay, here's two.

17
00:00:45,560 --> 00:00:49,480
Distancing themselves is something that a Dutch organization is trying to do with Astrid

18
00:00:49,480 --> 00:00:53,860
Romer, a poet from the former Dutch colony of Suriname, after it awarded her with a prestigious

19
00:00:53,860 --> 00:00:55,880
literary prize earlier this year.

20
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:59,720
Recently, she made controversial statements supporting murderous former president of Suriname

21
00:00:59,720 --> 00:01:04,080
Desi Buterce, and the Dutch organizers of the award chose to forgo the ceremony honoring

22
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:07,160
her and simply gave her the cash prize with little fanfare.

23
00:01:07,160 --> 00:01:10,720
Romer, like any real poet, is sticking to her words.

24
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:14,360
Back underground we go, this time to Petit Mustique, which is part of St. Vincent and

25
00:01:14,360 --> 00:01:18,920
the Grenadines, where a human skull was unearthed on this remote, rugged island in 2003.

26
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:24,120
And this year, researchers at the University of Oregon may have uncovered why it was there—skeletal

27
00:01:24,120 --> 00:01:28,360
abnormalities show the female likely had leprosy, and this isolated part of the Caribbean was

28
00:01:28,360 --> 00:01:32,000
probably used to keep people with the disease away from the public—something that many

29
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,760
have speculated, but this finding actually supports.

30
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:39,760
The skull dates back 200 years, and is possibly the earliest case of leprosy recorded in the

31
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:40,760
Americas.

32
00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:44,160
There is also some speculation that Tunisian president Kayis Said's appointment of a

33
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:47,760
female prime minister may have been a way to calm critics who say he's overreaching

34
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:51,080
his power in the Arab Spring's only remaining democracy.

35
00:01:51,080 --> 00:01:55,520
Before Najla Boudin-Ramadanhay's appointment, Said had already suspended Parliament, seized

36
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:58,800
power, and fired the previous prime minister, and because Ramadanhay doesn't have a lot

37
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:02,580
of political experience, her trajectory could be challenging—but she is already making

38
00:02:02,580 --> 00:02:06,160
history as the first female prime minister in the Arab world.

39
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:10,240
The Maldives have the unenvious position of exemplifying climate change's already dire

40
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:14,300
effects on low-lying nations, where 30% of the country's annual government budget is

41
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:16,760
being spent on adapting to climate change.

42
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:20,600
Developed nations have agreed to spend $100 billion to help vulnerable countries adapt,

43
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:24,040
but Maldives' speaker of parliament wants more—he's asking that rich nations also

44
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:27,820
pay reparations to help the others deal with the consequences they're already suffering,

45
00:02:27,820 --> 00:02:29,840
and likely didn't cause.

46
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:33,800
Islands in the Caribbean continue to bet big on tourism, especially countries like Dominica,

47
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:37,600
which offers citizenship by investment through properties like the six-star resort of Secret

48
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:38,600
Bay.

49
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:42,160
For the fifth year in a row, Dominica was named the best country for second citizenship

50
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:44,200
by Professional Wealth Management magazine.

51
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:47,840
The second home citizens have primarily come from Africa, but with a new non-stop flight

52
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:51,640
from Miami running, that could potentially change with Americans starting to look south

53
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:53,880
for another home and passport.

54
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:58,120
Added bonus, Dominican residents now get visa-free access to China.

55
00:02:58,120 --> 00:03:02,360
When we say coral reef, you probably say, ugh, that's because a lot of news about

56
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:06,320
the ocean's critical habitat for fish species is generally bad, and that could have been

57
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:11,080
the expectation after tropical cyclone Winston caused more than $1.4 billion in damage to

58
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:16,040
Fiji in 2016 and pummeled the island's reefs, but they've bounced back in a big way as

59
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:19,960
young coral colonies have taken off, much to the delight of researchers, residents,

60
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:22,920
and likely the colorful fish that have found a new home.

61
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:26,920
Also in repair are more than a handful of the 130 precious historical artifacts that

62
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:30,000
were destroyed in the harbor blast in Lebanon that killed 200 people.

63
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,880
While the objects pale in comparison to human lives, their historical significance remains

64
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:38,760
important, and that's why the British Museum granted $29,500 in restoration funds to help

65
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:43,360
repair some of the more critical glass vessels, which are nearly 2,000 years old.

66
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:47,840
Here on the northwest tip of Africa, an ongoing conflict between Algeria and Morocco might

67
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:49,280
leave Spain in the cold.

68
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:53,600
Spain gets about half of its gas from Algeria, which pumps it through a pipeline in Morocco.

69
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:57,640
Morocco depends on Algeria for about 10% of its gas, and Algeria suspended this pipeline

70
00:03:57,640 --> 00:04:01,600
to both countries to upset Morocco in an ongoing territorial dispute.

71
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:05,080
It turns out, this may affect Spaniards the most, and we'll still be able to get gas

72
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:08,440
through alternate routes, but at much higher prices.

73
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:10,560
Moldova is running out of gas too.

74
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:14,320
At the end of its contract with Gazprom, Moldova declared a state of emergency when

75
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:18,040
the Russian energy company raised its gas prices and slashed supply.

76
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:22,100
Accused of using gas as leverage, allegations have surfaced that contract renegotiations

77
00:04:22,100 --> 00:04:26,120
involve discussion of political issues regarding Moldova's separatist region of Transnistria

78
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:28,520
and its connection to the EU.

79
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:32,200
Associated with the EU but reliant on Russian resources, Moldova frequently finds itself

80
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:36,040
in the unenviable position of sitting between east and west.

81
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:40,520
From unenviable to regrettable, a mafia fugitive did himself in by appearing on a YouTube cooking

82
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:43,200
show in his adopted home of the Dominican Republic.

83
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:47,120
Though he never showed his face while flashing his Italian culinary chops, Mark-friend Claude

84
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:49,440
Biart's tattoos gave him away to the police.

85
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:53,020
A member of Italy's largest mafia, who fled Europe when accused of trafficking cocaine

86
00:04:53,020 --> 00:04:58,000
into the Netherlands, Biart led a quiet, unassuming, and, in hindsight, too comfortable life in

87
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,360
the city of Boca Chica.

88
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:04,220
An apocalyptic scene unfolded just off the coast of Azerbaijan as a column of fire blasted

89
00:05:04,220 --> 00:05:05,520
out of the Caspian Sea.

90
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:09,620
While the Caspian is dotted by various offshore oil rigs, the assumed culprit for the flare-up

91
00:05:09,620 --> 00:05:13,580
wasn't a leaky Soviet-era pipeline, but one of the region's infamous mud volcanoes

92
00:05:13,580 --> 00:05:14,780
sparking the blast.

93
00:05:14,780 --> 00:05:18,940
Dubbed the Land of Fire, Azerbaijan is home to major oil reserves and hundreds of these

94
00:05:18,940 --> 00:05:22,040
mud volcanoes—many of which are active today.

95
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:25,540
What happens underground is also of interest in Saint Lucia, where the Caribbean nation

96
00:05:25,540 --> 00:05:28,780
is taking the first steps towards harnessing geothermal energy.

97
00:05:28,780 --> 00:05:32,960
Currently, Saint Lucia relies primarily on diesel generators for power, so any alternative

98
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:37,320
that would alleviate high energy costs is welcomed, especially one as green as geothermal.

99
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:41,280
The next step is figuring out viability—a project that will be greatly aided by a $22

100
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:45,520
million grant made by the World Bank to explore the potential of the energy source.

101
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:49,920
In Ecuador's most famous islands, Darwin's arch died of natural causes.

102
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:54,240
Just a kilometer or 0.6 miles off the coast of Darwin Island in the Galapagos, the arch

103
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:57,840
was a popular destination for divers and photographers.

104
00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:01,160
Ecuadorian officials said that the bridge was brought down by natural erosion.

105
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:04,840
Year by year, though, erosion is becoming more of a threat and less natural, as volatile

106
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:08,880
weather and warming waters are intensifying the process that created many of the earth's

107
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:10,800
arches in the first place.

108
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:13,520
Another troubling trend came to a head in China.

109
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:17,160
Birth rates in the world's most populous country hit an all-time low since the country

110
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:19,880
began tabulating the figure in 1978.

111
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:24,040
Infamous for its one-child policy, China has began easing restrictions on family size since

112
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:27,720
2015, as dropping birth rates began to worry state officials.

113
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:31,200
This year's low watermark, though, hints that the problem may be beyond policy and

114
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:34,800
expected demographic shifts as the country develops, and more so a function of rising

115
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:39,220
cost of living and financial insecurity pushing potential parents to hold off.

116
00:06:39,220 --> 00:06:42,320
Birds too are adapting to changing material living conditions.

117
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:47,000
A study of 77 non-migratory birds undertaken in Brazil has shown that each species has

118
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:50,180
become smaller in stature over the past 40 years.

119
00:06:50,180 --> 00:06:54,040
This finding, in species confined to remote areas of the Amazon, has allowed researchers

120
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:58,720
to conclude that the shrinking is in response to the one major alteration in their environment—temperature

121
00:06:58,720 --> 00:06:59,720
rise.

122
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:02,560
While the researchers haven't come to a consensus, it's hypothesized that the birds

123
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:06,120
are slimming down because they simply aren't required to generate the same body heat as

124
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:09,280
in decades prior—humans are doing it for them.

125
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:14,120
A decision made by Colombia's Congress gave Vicê, often referred to as African-Columbian

126
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:17,300
moonshine, its well-deserved moment in the sun.

127
00:07:17,300 --> 00:07:21,560
Recognizing the liquor distilled from sugarcane by generations of African-Columbians as a

128
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:27,160
piece of the country's ancestral and cultural heritage is an honor, and for many, an opportunity.

129
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:31,260
This notoriety, experts believe, will provide an opportunity for distillers to capitalize

130
00:07:31,260 --> 00:07:35,600
on the product, giving it the chance to follow the same trajectory as Mezcal in Mexico and

131
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:38,320
to create generational wealth locally.

132
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:42,720
While other parts of former Yugoslavia threatened to fall apart, North Macedonia celebrated

133
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:47,960
2021, as the year marked the 30th anniversary of its peacefully established independence.

134
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:52,400
A military parade through the capital of Skopje and celebrations across the country marked

135
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:53,400
the occasion.

136
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:57,620
While independent for decades, integration into the West has been a winding road as disputes

137
00:07:57,620 --> 00:08:01,840
with Greece saw the country relinquish its original name, Macedonia, for its current

138
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:03,400
moniker.

139
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:07,200
Another milestone was reached this year when Joe Biden became the first US President to

140
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:10,960
acknowledge that the Armenian Genocide was, in fact, a genocide.

141
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:15,320
In Armenia, and across the Armenian diaspora, the news was welcomed with a tepid response

142
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:19,160
not because of the 106 years of separation from the event, but because the declaration

143
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:21,900
is, of course, merely a declaration.

144
00:08:21,900 --> 00:08:25,580
Many see the statement as a symbolic gesture designed to test the relationship with Turkey,

145
00:08:25,580 --> 00:08:29,540
who has yet to qualify the historic atrocity as a genocide.

146
00:08:29,540 --> 00:08:33,980
A move that may have large repercussions caught the eye of free speech advocates worldwide

147
00:08:33,980 --> 00:08:38,600
when Thailand's government banned the dissemination of news that quote, causes public fear.

148
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:42,540
The government framed the mandate as a move to limit the dangerous spread of disinformation,

149
00:08:42,540 --> 00:08:44,260
but critics see it differently.

150
00:08:44,260 --> 00:08:47,940
The ban, which allows the government to block individuals' internet access, conveniently

151
00:08:47,940 --> 00:08:53,220
materialized just as criticism with the government's slow rollout of vaccines hit fever pitch.

152
00:08:53,220 --> 00:08:57,820
For Peru's conservative right, there's been no escaping fear-inducing news in 2021,

153
00:08:57,820 --> 00:09:02,300
as a narrow election saw the swearing in of Socialist President Pedro Castillo.

154
00:09:02,300 --> 00:09:06,660
The rise of the rural teacher-turned-politician caught the world off guard and certainly didn't

155
00:09:06,660 --> 00:09:09,960
sit right with the country's established power brokers, who immediately contested the

156
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:13,060
result and whose supporters harassed election officials.

157
00:09:13,060 --> 00:09:17,300
Only months in, Castillo's presidency is barely holding on as his approval rating has

158
00:09:17,340 --> 00:09:21,180
plummeted, and a possible move to impeach hangs in the balance.

159
00:09:21,180 --> 00:09:25,320
A world record also hung in the balance this year, as spectators along an Antiguan harbor

160
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:29,320
anxiously awaited the appearance of Jasmine Harrison's rowboat on the horizon.

161
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:32,900
She and her boat eventually pulled into the waters of Antigua and Barbuda, the nation

162
00:09:32,900 --> 00:09:36,740
that marks the finish line of the Talisker Whiskey Atlantic Challenge, and Harrison became

163
00:09:36,740 --> 00:09:41,700
the youngest woman to row the Atlantic solo—a 70-day long odyssey that saw her thrown overboard

164
00:09:41,700 --> 00:09:44,620
twice, and her medal tested constantly.

165
00:09:44,620 --> 00:09:47,840
Moving to the end of their own odyssey is the Scythian gold.

166
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:51,560
This year, a Dutch court ruled that the trove of Crimean treasures dating back to the days

167
00:09:51,560 --> 00:09:54,520
of the Silk Road rightfully belonged to Ukraine.

168
00:09:54,520 --> 00:09:58,780
On display in 2014, when Russia annexed the peninsula, the fate of these cultural artifacts

169
00:09:58,780 --> 00:10:01,780
has been in limbo for years before this ruling.

170
00:10:01,780 --> 00:10:05,620
Russia has criticized the ruling, while Ukraine has labeled this another recognition of the

171
00:10:05,620 --> 00:10:08,700
world's condemnation over Russia's seizure of the peninsula.

172
00:10:08,700 --> 00:10:11,580
In Saint Kitts and Nevis, the story's apiculture.

173
00:10:11,580 --> 00:10:16,220
Now, if you aren't a former G.O.B. champion with an expansive vocabulary, you may not

174
00:10:16,220 --> 00:10:18,840
recognize the place nor the practice.

175
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:23,220
All the same, the Crimean nation of 50,000 joined an international effort to help launch

176
00:10:23,220 --> 00:10:25,940
and support local beekeeping businesses.

177
00:10:25,940 --> 00:10:29,500
If properly executed, the initiative will create additional jobs, bring local honey

178
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:34,220
and wax products to market, and help protect biodiversity by keeping pollinators, well,

179
00:10:34,220 --> 00:10:35,220
buzzing.

180
00:10:35,220 --> 00:10:40,260
West of where a bulk of bees is set to soon buzz, Mexican politicians and activists battled.

181
00:10:40,260 --> 00:10:44,380
After much debate, it was announced that Mexico's 150-year-old Columbus statue was

182
00:10:44,380 --> 00:10:47,140
to be replaced by a statue of an indigenous woman.

183
00:10:47,140 --> 00:10:51,140
A reasonable decision at surface level, and one that recognizes two oft-overlooked groups

184
00:10:51,140 --> 00:10:55,500
in Mexico, women, and indigenous people, some see the move as political posturing by Mayor

185
00:10:55,500 --> 00:10:59,620
Claudia Chabon, one that wins her positive PR without actually helping the plight of

186
00:10:59,620 --> 00:11:02,300
indigenous Mexicans or women.

187
00:11:02,300 --> 00:11:06,260
From statues in metaphorical hot water to those physically under it, Granada announced

188
00:11:06,260 --> 00:11:09,820
the completion of a renovation to its underwater sculpture park.

189
00:11:10,380 --> 00:11:13,100
The repairs and cleaning of already existing sculptures were part of the project, but the

190
00:11:13,100 --> 00:11:18,200
most exciting bit was the new 82-piece installation celebrating Grenadian culture.

191
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:22,600
Since its creation in 2006, the park has offered habitat for marine wildlife and served as

192
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:27,460
an important tourist draw—the renovation aims to maintain that positive momentum.

193
00:11:27,460 --> 00:11:31,380
Though hard to imagine, things are getting more complicated in a country with two names

194
00:11:31,380 --> 00:11:32,820
and three presidents.

195
00:11:32,820 --> 00:11:37,580
Calling it a quote, existential threat, one top American diplomat flew to Bosnia-Herzegovina

196
00:11:37,580 --> 00:11:41,980
to coax Bosnian Serb leader Milorad Dodik to lighten his separatist rhetoric that, if

197
00:11:41,980 --> 00:11:45,980
acted on, would potentially nosedive the nation and destabilize the region.

198
00:11:45,980 --> 00:11:50,580
The epicenter of ethnic violence in the mid-1990s that took painstaking negotiations to quell,

199
00:11:50,580 --> 00:11:55,060
a separatist move like the one Dodik threatens would set the region back decades.

200
00:11:55,060 --> 00:11:59,860
If nothing else good came of it, the pandemic offered zoo animals a well-earned rest.

201
00:11:59,860 --> 00:12:04,500
In Sri Lanka, where zoos closed in March of 2020 and have only briefly opened since, animals

202
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:08,540
have taken the newfound peace and quiet to deeper relationships and spend a lot of time

203
00:12:08,540 --> 00:12:09,540
in bed.

204
00:12:09,540 --> 00:12:13,940
The result was a baby boom, as some species—the black swan and white peacock—made it in

205
00:12:13,940 --> 00:12:18,260
Sri Lankan zoos for the first time ever, while others such as lions have accelerated their

206
00:12:18,260 --> 00:12:21,620
output in lieu of nosy onlookers.

207
00:12:21,620 --> 00:12:25,700
Perhaps the world could have used a few more nosy onlookers in the Seal of Oman this year,

208
00:12:25,700 --> 00:12:29,960
as noted not-friends Iran and the US offered wildly different accounts as to what really

209
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:33,700
happened when Iran seized an oil tanker just off its coast.

210
00:12:33,700 --> 00:12:37,100
Cuban officials claim that the US had taken their tanker before their successful naval

211
00:12:37,100 --> 00:12:41,380
assault reclaimed the ship, while the US officials say that it was a Vietnamese tanker that Iran

212
00:12:41,380 --> 00:12:42,500
had seized.

213
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:46,640
Regardless of who's telling the truth, this most recent rift offers a reminder of just

214
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:50,500
how rocky the relationships between the two nations remain.

215
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:52,780
Cuban officials wouldn't be fooled twice this year.

216
00:12:52,780 --> 00:12:56,660
After the largest protests in 30 years caught them off guard in July, the government made

217
00:12:56,660 --> 00:13:00,000
sure to stamp out the next protest before it even started.

218
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:04,600
As news spread of a potential pro-democracy, freedom of expression demonstration, the state

219
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:08,080
didn't let noted protestors leave their homes, arrested congregators, and released

220
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:12,760
media claiming that protests were an attempt of regime change by the hands of the US.

221
00:13:12,760 --> 00:13:16,960
One European country has proved especially welcome to Afghan refugees, and it's one

222
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:18,680
of the continent's poorest.

223
00:13:18,680 --> 00:13:22,960
Albania, bolstered by a country familiar with and receptive to immigrants, pledged to take

224
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:25,720
in as many as 4,000 Afghans.

225
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:30,360
The nearly 700 that made it to the coastal nation were put up in beachside resorts.

226
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:34,600
Albania is likely just a year-long stop for refugees as they seek to secure visas to countries

227
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:37,960
that offer more opportunity, but Albania has made it clear that they're more than welcome

228
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:40,240
to stay should they want to.

229
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:44,280
Michael B. Jordan understands first-hand the baggage that comes with a name.

230
00:13:44,280 --> 00:13:48,120
Perhaps that's why the actor was willing to change the name of his new rum brand, initially

231
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:52,480
called Juvert, once Trinidad and Tobagoans took offense to his trademarking the term

232
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:55,280
that refers to the opening of their famed Carnaval.

233
00:13:55,280 --> 00:13:59,280
Labeling the act as cultural appropriation, thousands from Trinidad and Tobago signed

234
00:13:59,280 --> 00:14:03,840
an online petition to protect and respect a word that means so much to their culture.

235
00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:07,440
The coca de mer, a palm tree that produces the world's largest and, subjectively the

236
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:10,920
most inappropriate seed in the world, only exists in Seychelles.

237
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:15,700
In fact, the tree only grows on two of the archipelago's 115 islands while the rare

238
00:14:15,700 --> 00:14:20,640
seed, sold mostly to bemused tourists, fetches up to $260.

239
00:14:20,640 --> 00:14:24,800
Beloved by islanders, heavily regulated by the government, and yet still endangered,

240
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:28,880
Seychelles is taking a new approach to conserving the tree by putting seeds in the hands of

241
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:29,880
locals.

242
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:33,060
Those interested in growing the tree on their property can apply for the honor and must

243
00:14:33,060 --> 00:14:37,280
prove they have enough room and the right soil for the palm to take off.

244
00:14:37,280 --> 00:14:41,500
Sending mail to the Chagos Archipelago became a bit more difficult this year.

245
00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:44,960
Recognizing Mauritius' sovereignty over the chain of islands that's now one of Britain's

246
00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:49,180
last and most controversial colonial holdings, the UN's postal union decided it would no

247
00:14:49,180 --> 00:14:53,360
longer recognize postage stamps issued by the British Indian Overseas Territory of the

248
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:54,360
UK.

249
00:14:54,920 --> 00:14:57,940
This move adds ever so slightly to the pressure on Britain to leave the chain and represents

250
00:14:57,940 --> 00:15:02,040
another baby step towards returning home for Chagossians forcibly relocated to Mauritius

251
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:03,600
decades ago.

252
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:07,440
Cristiano Ronaldo couldn't wait to get home after a controversial call in Serbia cost

253
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:10,840
him and his country important World Cup qualifying points.

254
00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:15,240
However, throwing his captain's armband down in disgust as he exited the pitch unintentionally

255
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:20,680
did a world of good for a six-month-old Serbian boy with spinal muscular atrophy.

256
00:15:20,680 --> 00:15:24,520
Added to a charity group who then auctioned off the armband, Ronaldo's frustration resulted

257
00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:30,720
in a $71,000 haul—money which went directly to the six-month-old's treatment.

258
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:34,380
In Kuwait, things aren't looking quite as dire for those nearing the other end of the

259
00:15:34,380 --> 00:15:38,600
age spectrum as the country's legislator reversed a ban on employing expatriates over

260
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:40,160
the age of 60.

261
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:44,040
Struck down because it had no legal basis, the ruling serves as just a respite for the

262
00:15:44,040 --> 00:15:48,080
nation's expat population, who have been leaving by the thousands as the state continues

263
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:52,280
to push for the development of its domestic workforce through its years-long Kuwaitization

264
00:15:52,280 --> 00:15:53,280
project.

265
00:15:53,280 --> 00:15:57,200
A more substantial legal ruling was recorded this year in Malaysia, as the country's

266
00:15:57,200 --> 00:16:02,080
highest court ruled that the Islamic provision that banned same-sex acts was unconstitutional.

267
00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:07,160
LGBTQ advocates have called the ruling historic, as the country experienced an uptick in homophobic

268
00:16:07,160 --> 00:16:09,120
sentiment in recent years.

269
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:13,640
This ruling, though, does not legalize same-sex acts, as a civil law from Britain's colonial

270
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:16,680
era banning those is still on the books.

271
00:16:16,680 --> 00:16:20,840
Costa Rica earned some well-deserved national attention, but the country was named one of

272
00:16:20,840 --> 00:16:25,280
the five winners of the Earthshot Prize—a global sustainability effort spearheaded by

273
00:16:25,280 --> 00:16:27,800
Prince William and Kate Middleton.

274
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:32,540
Financed largely by taxes on fossil fuels, Costa Rica has handed more than $500 million

275
00:16:32,540 --> 00:16:36,740
to landowners over the past 20 years to protect forests and watersheds.

276
00:16:36,740 --> 00:16:40,120
The effort has largely reversed deforestation in the country.

277
00:16:40,120 --> 00:16:44,460
While the prize money is nice, the international recognition serves as a proof of concept for

278
00:16:44,460 --> 00:16:49,000
other nations, and a pat on the back for forward-thinking Costa Rica.

279
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,940
Forward-thinking was the praise Georgia thought it might reap when the country broke ground

280
00:16:51,940 --> 00:16:55,580
on its, quote, hyper-modern Parliament building a decade ago.

281
00:16:55,580 --> 00:17:00,220
Today, though, it sits empty, and its glass windows meant to signal government transparency

282
00:17:00,220 --> 00:17:01,640
gather dust.

283
00:17:01,640 --> 00:17:05,180
Done in by its distance from the capital and the new political regime's distaste for

284
00:17:05,180 --> 00:17:09,740
it, the building was abandoned in 2018, then put up for sale through May of 2021, when

285
00:17:09,740 --> 00:17:12,940
the government finally gave up on finding a buyer.

286
00:17:12,940 --> 00:17:17,660
As Georgia gave up on its governmental greenhouse, Oman announced their aim to build a massive

287
00:17:17,660 --> 00:17:19,340
green hydrogen plant.

288
00:17:19,340 --> 00:17:23,420
Oman's following the forward-thinking theme by working to smooth an impending economic

289
00:17:23,420 --> 00:17:28,700
transition as 85% of the country's GDP is generated from oil and gas—resources which

290
00:17:28,700 --> 00:17:30,740
the country is quickly running out of.

291
00:17:30,740 --> 00:17:34,620
Powered by wind and solar, it's hoped that the $30 billion project will be producing

292
00:17:34,620 --> 00:17:37,980
and exporting renewable energy at full capacity by 2038.

293
00:17:37,980 --> 00:17:42,140
In the very same year that Barbados ended symbolic ties with the Queen of England and

294
00:17:42,140 --> 00:17:47,340
became a republic, the nation's most famous export, Rihanna, became a national hero.

295
00:17:47,340 --> 00:17:51,540
Well, technically the artist, entrepreneur, and proud Bajan has been a national icon in

296
00:17:51,540 --> 00:17:55,540
the country for more than a decade, but this year her legendary status became official

297
00:17:55,540 --> 00:17:59,300
when the new republic's prime minister designated her a national hero.

298
00:17:59,300 --> 00:18:03,340
Already an ambassador for the Caribbean country, and recently named the world's richest female

299
00:18:03,340 --> 00:18:07,520
musician, it seems that Rihanna's reign just won't let up, and Barbados is all the

300
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:09,140
better for it.

301
00:18:09,140 --> 00:18:14,140
At the other end of the Caribbean, three Cubans survived 33 days on a barren Bahamian island

302
00:18:14,140 --> 00:18:16,540
before being rescued by the US Coast Guard.

303
00:18:16,540 --> 00:18:20,660
After capsizing at sea, likely in an attempt to flee Cuba, the three washed up on one of

304
00:18:20,660 --> 00:18:25,720
the least hospitable Bahamas, surviving on coconut water, conch shells, and rats.

305
00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:29,480
After receiving brief medical attention in Florida, the resourceful survivors were handed

306
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:32,420
over to US Immigration and Customs Enforcement.

307
00:18:32,420 --> 00:18:35,500
This isn't the first time the Bahamas have found itself as the meeting point between

308
00:18:35,500 --> 00:18:39,980
Cuban defectors and the US, as a similar rescue took place a few islands over, not months

309
00:18:39,980 --> 00:18:41,340
before this one.

310
00:18:41,340 --> 00:18:45,180
The Bahamas have hardly been the focal point for dangerous American migrations, though.

311
00:18:45,180 --> 00:18:50,180
It's been a record-breaking year for Panama immigration officials as a whopping 70,000

312
00:18:50,180 --> 00:18:54,040
migrants from around the world have passed through the Darien Gap and into the country.

313
00:18:54,040 --> 00:18:58,660
Such incredible numbers making their way through the undeveloped, densely forested, and crime-riddled

314
00:18:58,660 --> 00:19:03,120
route with no formal roadways has pushed Panamanian and Colombian officials to begin regulating

315
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:08,000
the number of entrants into the Darien Gap—potentially a first step in making the journey safer for

316
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,280
the desperate migrants.

317
00:19:10,280 --> 00:19:13,600
International collaboration was the context that informed an embarrassing development

318
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:14,840
in Bulgaria.

319
00:19:14,840 --> 00:19:19,920
Led by the US Army, the NATO military exercise called Swift Response brought together 7,000

320
00:19:19,920 --> 00:19:23,280
paratroopers from ten member nations for some joint practice.

321
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:27,480
Swift Response, though, quickly became seriously regrettable when American soldiers accidentally

322
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:32,400
left the training zone and barged into and cleared out a Bulgarian sunflower oil factory.

323
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:36,640
The factory has since filed a lawsuit while the US Embassy, for its part, has apologized

324
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:38,400
for the mistake.

325
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:42,160
Netflix further expanded its reach when it greenlit the company's first feature-length

326
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:44,020
film shot in Uruguay.

327
00:19:44,020 --> 00:19:48,200
The company's VP of Latin American Content has hailed the project as an exciting opportunity

328
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:50,280
to highlight the creative talent in the country.

329
00:19:50,280 --> 00:19:54,400
While it's unlikely that viewers will recognize names when the credits roll, the film, named

330
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:58,680
Togo, will fit right in in the current cinematic canon as the crime revolves around street-level

331
00:19:58,680 --> 00:20:01,440
drug trafficking and organized crime.

332
00:20:01,480 --> 00:20:05,640
Following the appearance of mysterious metallic monoliths across the American West and in

333
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:09,920
Romania, a similar structure appeared in southwest Turkey, but this one came with a message in

334
00:20:09,920 --> 00:20:14,120
ancient Turkish—quote, look at the sky and you will see the moon.

335
00:20:14,120 --> 00:20:17,480
Residents didn't have to wait long on an explanation as to the origins of the structure

336
00:20:17,480 --> 00:20:21,440
and its innocuous truism, though, as only days after its discovery, President Erdogan

337
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:25,080
used the monolith as a background when he announced the country's new space program

338
00:20:25,080 --> 00:20:30,000
and ten-year vision, proving the monolith's function as an eye-rolling gimmick.

339
00:20:30,040 --> 00:20:33,800
By overlooking tradition at the Tokyo Olympics, one sprinter, rather than running for her

340
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:36,040
country, ran away from it.

341
00:20:36,040 --> 00:20:39,440
Accusing her coaches of negligence before being pulled from her event and pressured

342
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:44,040
to return home to Belarus, Kristina Sayu-Muskaja fled to the Polish embassy where she was granted

343
00:20:44,040 --> 00:20:45,660
a humanitarian visa.

344
00:20:45,660 --> 00:20:50,240
The incident exemplifies the mounting pressure on Belarusian public figures under the country's

345
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:54,280
increasingly authoritarian government as she joins a growing list of athletes, coaches,

346
00:20:54,280 --> 00:20:58,520
and high-profile Belarusians that have faced job loss, arrest, or imprisonment when voicing

347
00:20:58,520 --> 00:21:01,800
discontent with the government in the past two years.

348
00:21:01,800 --> 00:21:05,620
State overreach is also the fear in Russia, as the Moscow Metro has implemented a new

349
00:21:05,620 --> 00:21:09,260
method of payment at over 240 stations called FacePay.

350
00:21:09,260 --> 00:21:13,600
As the program's name suggests, Moscow commuters can now leave their phone and wallet at home

351
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:15,800
and simply smile for the camera to board the train.

352
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:19,560
In a country where governmental transparency is hard to come by and facial recognition

353
00:21:19,560 --> 00:21:23,880
has been allegedly used to identify protestors, FacePay has human rights groups and dubious

354
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:27,780
citizens concerned by the project's potential ulterior motives.

355
00:21:27,780 --> 00:21:31,500
In another former Soviet state, government officials made a statement as to where their

356
00:21:31,500 --> 00:21:36,220
current allegiances lie when they kicked out an outspoken US-Russian dual national.

357
00:21:36,220 --> 00:21:40,260
Receiving a letter notifying he was barred from entry into Kazakhstan, Gene Bunnan, who

358
00:21:40,260 --> 00:21:44,460
founded a victim's database to track the incarceration of Uyghurs in western China,

359
00:21:44,460 --> 00:21:48,680
serves as an example as to how closely Kazakhstan has come to align itself with China, not only

360
00:21:48,680 --> 00:21:53,260
turning a blind eye to what the US and UN have come to define as genocide, but now seemingly

361
00:21:53,260 --> 00:21:56,860
helping to quiet dissent within its own borders.

362
00:21:56,940 --> 00:22:00,560
While some bonds are strengthening in Central Asia, others in the Pacific are beginning

363
00:22:00,560 --> 00:22:01,700
to crumble.

364
00:22:01,700 --> 00:22:06,060
The result of a vote on the new Secretary-General for the Pacific Islands Forum was the last

365
00:22:06,060 --> 00:22:09,740
straw for the tiny Micronesian country of Palau, who announced they'd be leaving the

366
00:22:09,740 --> 00:22:10,740
organization.

367
00:22:10,740 --> 00:22:14,740
The coalition long had an informal tradition of rotating its Secretary-General position

368
00:22:14,740 --> 00:22:19,640
between Micronesian, Polynesian, and Melanesian politicians, but the election of a Cook Islands

369
00:22:19,640 --> 00:22:23,720
politician was a break from convention that left Micronesian nations like Palau and other

370
00:22:23,720 --> 00:22:27,240
small island states that would follow their lead, feeling slighted and voiceless in the

371
00:22:27,240 --> 00:22:29,400
organization's proceedings.

372
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:33,140
Trophy hunting of large carnivores is banned in Romania, but that didn't stop Prince

373
00:22:33,140 --> 00:22:37,520
Emmanuel von Unzerlichtenstein of Austria from shooting the country's, and potentially

374
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:40,160
the European Union's, single largest brown bear.

375
00:22:40,160 --> 00:22:43,880
While the Prince had authorization from the Romanian government to hunt a female nuisance

376
00:22:43,880 --> 00:22:48,640
bear causing problems for a small farm town, he managed to bag the massive 17-year-old

377
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:53,000
Arthur, whether by accident or intentionally, is under investigation.

378
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:57,060
In another mountainous Eastern European country, construction crews put the finishing touches

379
00:22:57,060 --> 00:23:00,500
on a state-of-the-art highway that cuts through rugged Montenegro.

380
00:23:00,500 --> 00:23:04,140
Rather than celebrating, though, residents are beginning to ask questions about the road's

381
00:23:04,140 --> 00:23:05,500
one billion dollar price tag.

382
00:23:05,500 --> 00:23:09,880
The road only connects a few small communities, including the town at its terminus, Matasevo,

383
00:23:09,880 --> 00:23:11,980
home to a population of 15.

384
00:23:11,980 --> 00:23:16,700
An early Belt and Road project built by Chinese crews, Montenegro's finances are now seriously

385
00:23:16,700 --> 00:23:20,560
strained by the road that really doesn't serve much of a purpose.

386
00:23:20,560 --> 00:23:24,720
The people of Brunei are hoping for more sage decision-making from the new CEO of the

387
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:29,240
nation's largest financial institution, Bank Islam Brunei Dar Es Salaam.

388
00:23:29,240 --> 00:23:33,940
Hij Nouriani will be the first female CEO of the bank that manages $10 billion of assets

389
00:23:33,940 --> 00:23:38,060
and has expanded across Southeast Asia and into the Middle East in recent years.

390
00:23:38,060 --> 00:23:42,700
After naming three women to top positions in 2019, the move follows an empowering trend

391
00:23:42,700 --> 00:23:45,660
at the bank in the traditionally conservative country.

392
00:23:45,660 --> 00:23:50,540
In Argentina, a 30-year-old confirmed an age-old maxim—if it's too good to be true, then

393
00:23:50,540 --> 00:23:52,320
true, it usually is.

394
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:56,260
Searching for an explanation for a momentary Google outage, Nicolas Corona found that the

395
00:23:56,260 --> 00:24:02,400
domain google.com.ar had expired, and that he could buy it for a modest $2.60.

396
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:06,380
The Argentine quickly scooped up the domain that, if everything broke his way, could be

397
00:24:06,380 --> 00:24:08,200
worth millions.

398
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:11,920
The domain didn't prove a golden ticket, though, but a mistake as Google's ownership

399
00:24:11,920 --> 00:24:17,440
hadn't lapsed, but in the end, Corona came out of the situation a few dollars lighter.

400
00:24:17,460 --> 00:24:20,300
And a country that's been in the headlines for all the wrong reasons in the past few

401
00:24:20,300 --> 00:24:23,000
years has emerged a more positive story.

402
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:27,440
Rolls-Royce and Qatar announced a multi-year, multi-billion dollar partnership aimed to

403
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:29,600
foster green technology companies.

404
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:33,880
The partnership will build two campuses, one in each country, create an estimated 1,000

405
00:24:33,880 --> 00:24:37,920
jobs, and hopefully provide the resources and facilities for sustainability-oriented

406
00:24:37,920 --> 00:24:40,200
startups to take off.

407
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:45,180
Prosecc and Prosecco are two different types of wine with two different names.

408
00:24:45,180 --> 00:24:49,860
Almost how different the names are, though, has Croatia and Italy at loggerheads.

409
00:24:49,860 --> 00:24:53,200
Croatia has sought to trademark the name of their Prosecc with the European Commission

410
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:57,540
under the assumption that consumers would be able to differentiate it from Italian Prosecco.

411
00:24:57,540 --> 00:25:01,460
Italian wine aficionados think differently, and are fighting the move on account of potential

412
00:25:01,460 --> 00:25:02,500
confusion.

413
00:25:02,500 --> 00:25:06,720
Italians also see the effort as an attack on Italian products more broadly, as Prosecco

414
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:13,100
is a denomination of controlled origin—a wine that only comes from a specific region.

415
00:25:13,100 --> 00:25:18,180
The world's largest mammal, the blue whale, only feeds in a few specific regions—one

416
00:25:18,180 --> 00:25:20,780
of which is off the coast of Chilean Patagonia.

417
00:25:20,780 --> 00:25:24,820
Unfortunately for the endangered species, the water is also teeming with fishing vessels

418
00:25:24,820 --> 00:25:29,000
working the busy salmon farming industry, with up to 1,000 boats a day passing through

419
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:30,300
the feeding grounds.

420
00:25:30,300 --> 00:25:34,500
This traffic has led to a handful of fatal collisions between boat and blue whale.

421
00:25:34,500 --> 00:25:38,420
With the regional population estimated to be only in the hundreds, conservationists

422
00:25:38,420 --> 00:25:42,820
are scrambling to figure out a compromise that gives the whales a bit more room.

423
00:25:42,860 --> 00:25:47,300
Bahrain is keen on finding a bit more room, too—so keen, in fact, that the archipelago

424
00:25:47,300 --> 00:25:51,140
nation announced plans to expand its landmass by 60%.

425
00:25:51,140 --> 00:25:55,020
The island-building initiative will enlarge Bahrain's footprint, construct five new

426
00:25:55,020 --> 00:25:59,260
cities, and, the government hopes, attract billions in foreign investment.

427
00:25:59,260 --> 00:26:04,340
The project is set to build out tourist attractions, a sports city, and a commercial zone.

428
00:26:04,340 --> 00:26:09,380
From sports cities to sports washing, it was a big year for professional athletics in Saudi

429
00:26:09,380 --> 00:26:10,380
Arabia.

430
00:26:10,380 --> 00:26:14,600
Despite its high-profile, highly controversial takeover of Newcastle United, the country

431
00:26:14,600 --> 00:26:18,320
also announced a partnership between Gulf Saudi and the Asian tour that'll keep a

432
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:22,740
Saudi stomp on Asia's preeminent Gulf circuit and provide prize funding for a decade to

433
00:26:22,740 --> 00:26:23,740
come.

434
00:26:23,740 --> 00:26:27,540
While a quieter development than the Newcastle deal, many denounced the move as another attempt

435
00:26:27,540 --> 00:26:31,820
to move conversation and attention away from the country's human rights record with glitz

436
00:26:31,820 --> 00:26:33,280
and games.

437
00:26:33,280 --> 00:26:37,660
Issues with human rights records will be impossible to miss if the Chinese Fudan University is

438
00:26:37,660 --> 00:26:40,980
to follow through with building a campus in Budapest, Hungary.

439
00:26:40,980 --> 00:26:44,260
Many of the city's population oppose the project, and the city's mayor has called

440
00:26:44,260 --> 00:26:47,660
it an instance of, quote, Chinese influence buying.

441
00:26:47,660 --> 00:26:51,540
Residents are becoming increasingly creative in their pushback, recently renaming nearby

442
00:26:51,540 --> 00:26:55,360
streets Uyghur Martyrs, Dalai Lama, and Free Hong Kong Road.

443
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:59,700
One car skipped the streets entirely on its way from the Nitra Airport in Slovakia to

444
00:26:59,700 --> 00:27:04,580
that in Bratislava—instead, the prototype flew the 35-minute route.

445
00:27:04,580 --> 00:27:09,620
For Klein Vision's aircar, it was the 142nd landing, but an important first too as the

446
00:27:09,620 --> 00:27:13,460
car successfully transitioned into normal car mode in just minutes.

447
00:27:13,460 --> 00:27:17,160
While behind on the timeline that science fiction authors envisioned, flying cars are

448
00:27:17,160 --> 00:27:21,260
slowly coming around with Klein, Hyundai, and GM leading the way.

449
00:27:21,260 --> 00:27:25,060
Portugal's parliament pushed into the future of labor when it passed progressive measures

450
00:27:25,060 --> 00:27:27,460
to protect its increasingly online workforce.

451
00:27:27,460 --> 00:27:31,960
In response to the shift to working from home, new laws bar employers from contacting employees

452
00:27:31,960 --> 00:27:35,760
during off-hours, allow parents of children under eight to work from home without bosses'

453
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:39,820
approval, and require employers to pitch in on employees' electricity costs.

454
00:27:39,820 --> 00:27:43,240
The move comes in response to the pandemic, but also as an effort to protect Portugal's

455
00:27:43,240 --> 00:27:47,960
reputation as an attractive place for digital nomads to set up shop.

456
00:27:47,960 --> 00:27:52,000
Finding the remains of a different sort of nomad in Latvia cast doubt on previous theories

457
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:56,720
as to the dramatic decline of Stone Age peoples across Western Europe 5,000 years ago.

458
00:27:56,720 --> 00:28:01,460
DNA analysis of a hunter-gatherer showed the man died of the plague, making him the earliest

459
00:28:01,460 --> 00:28:04,580
victim of what was thought to have caused the mysterious population decline.

460
00:28:04,580 --> 00:28:08,860
Analysis, however, also showed that the strain he carried didn't spread easily, and caused

461
00:28:08,860 --> 00:28:11,340
milder symptoms than iterations that would follow.

462
00:28:11,340 --> 00:28:16,420
Now, rather than plague, scientists are looking at climate change as a catalyst.

463
00:28:16,420 --> 00:28:19,740
Successful Spanish YouTubers are making like wealthy bankers and professional athletes

464
00:28:19,740 --> 00:28:22,660
before them, and running to the hills of Andorra.

465
00:28:22,660 --> 00:28:26,420
One Spanish creator called Andorra the quote, Silicon Valley of YouTube, as the country

466
00:28:26,420 --> 00:28:30,460
has quickly developed into a creative meeting place, luring in the like-minded with light

467
00:28:30,460 --> 00:28:34,140
taxes, relative anonymity, and less stringent lockdown policies.

468
00:28:34,140 --> 00:28:38,580
The move has been a boon for Andorra's sputtering economy, and a real loss for Spain's, where

469
00:28:38,580 --> 00:28:43,500
local media has gone so far as to call Spanish YouTubers relocating unpatriotic.

470
00:28:43,500 --> 00:28:48,540
A sputtering economy, many feel, would be the result should Poland pivot away from coal.

471
00:28:48,540 --> 00:28:52,740
Currently, 70% of the country's energy comes from the non-renewable super polluter, and

472
00:28:52,740 --> 00:28:56,140
coal companies and miner unions hold serious political power.

473
00:28:56,140 --> 00:28:59,660
But Poland's appetite, and the massive strip mine on its border, are running Czech wells

474
00:28:59,860 --> 00:29:02,860
dry, or at least so the Czech Republic accuses.

475
00:29:02,860 --> 00:29:07,340
Citing European environmental laws, the Czech Republic has sued Poland, setting off a wave

476
00:29:07,340 --> 00:29:10,900
of conspiracy theories across coal country.

477
00:29:10,900 --> 00:29:13,920
Conspiratorial might seem like a good way to describe Lithuania's defense ministry

478
00:29:13,920 --> 00:29:17,780
calling for citizens to throw their Chinese-made cell phones away.

479
00:29:17,780 --> 00:29:21,740
The request, though, comes after the nation's cybersecurity center found that the Shomi

480
00:29:21,740 --> 00:29:26,940
Corp, a Chinese phone maker, have censored technology built into devices that track 449

481
00:29:26,940 --> 00:29:30,820
terms, including the likes of Free Tibet and Democracy Movement.

482
00:29:30,820 --> 00:29:35,860
The finding comes as relationships between China and Lithuania sour over Taiwan.

483
00:29:35,860 --> 00:29:41,020
One internationally recognized state, one defiant self-identifying state, two UK military

484
00:29:41,020 --> 00:29:46,240
bases, and one UN buffer zone to keep the peace hint at Cyprus' geopolitical complexity.

485
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:50,280
Things didn't get any simpler in 2021, when Turkish President Erdogan announced that in

486
00:29:50,280 --> 00:29:54,420
celebration of the 47th anniversary of Turkey invading the island, the country planned to

487
00:29:54,420 --> 00:29:58,200
resettle an abandoned and formerly Greek Cypriot tourist town.

488
00:29:58,200 --> 00:30:01,620
Celebrating an invasion with a different sort of invasion has received poor marks from the

489
00:30:01,620 --> 00:30:04,700
US, the UN, and Greek Cypriots.

490
00:30:04,700 --> 00:30:09,860
While heated geopolitical relations and politicians' hot air pose a threat in the Mediterranean,

491
00:30:09,860 --> 00:30:11,940
so too does literal heat.

492
00:30:11,940 --> 00:30:16,100
Greece, particularly vulnerable to climate change generally, and especially heat waves,

493
00:30:16,100 --> 00:30:19,180
has decided to begin to name the extreme bouts of heat.

494
00:30:19,180 --> 00:30:23,260
Categorizing heat waves is tricky, but any standardization will allow the country to

495
00:30:23,260 --> 00:30:27,700
better systematically respond to temperature upticks and communicate the danger.

496
00:30:27,700 --> 00:30:32,660
2021 marked the end of the Free Latifa campaign, as the movement hatched three years ago finally

497
00:30:32,660 --> 00:30:34,780
saw its vision come to fruition.

498
00:30:34,780 --> 00:30:39,140
Princess Latifa was captured by her father, Dubai's Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum,

499
00:30:39,140 --> 00:30:43,020
while trying to express a little self-determination and leave the United Arab Emirates.

500
00:30:43,020 --> 00:30:46,780
She had hardly been seen in the past three years, but it seems her confinement came to

501
00:30:46,780 --> 00:30:51,160
an abrupt end as an Instagram photo showed the princess traveling in Iceland, and a verifiable

502
00:30:51,160 --> 00:30:55,280
statement quoted her saying she could now, quote, travel where I want.

503
00:30:55,280 --> 00:30:59,440
Italian motorcyclists and golfers can now, within reason, travel where they want to,

504
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:00,760
and do so in style.

505
00:31:00,760 --> 00:31:04,780
The historic Italian car company, ESO, is relaunching with a young backer from the famed

506
00:31:04,780 --> 00:31:06,160
lineage leading the way.

507
00:31:06,160 --> 00:31:09,960
Catching the company up with the present and charging it into the future, Ferruccio Lamborghini

508
00:31:09,960 --> 00:31:14,840
and team are launching a motorcycle and golf cart that are modern, stylish, and sustainable.

509
00:31:14,840 --> 00:31:17,400
Both vehicles are completely electric.

510
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:21,760
A scarecrow of the seas may help to save lives of thousands of seabirds each year, thanks

511
00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:25,660
to researchers in Estonia who help develop a buoy with googly eyes.

512
00:31:25,660 --> 00:31:29,780
The device floats above small-scale fishing operation gillnets, which can be lethal to

513
00:31:29,780 --> 00:31:32,600
diving seabirds, and deters them from coming near.

514
00:31:32,600 --> 00:31:36,840
In fact, scientists found it reduced the congregating birds by about a quarter, who are turned off

515
00:31:36,840 --> 00:31:40,200
by eye contact and erratic buoy behavior.

516
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:43,920
Another sort of deterrent is the addition of Malta to an international gray list kept

517
00:31:43,920 --> 00:31:48,400
by Financial Action Task Force—a watchdog organization meant to monitor money laundering

518
00:31:48,400 --> 00:31:49,880
and terrorism funding.

519
00:31:49,880 --> 00:31:53,720
In recent years, the island nation's low tax rate for foreign companies has attracted

520
00:31:53,720 --> 00:31:57,440
substantial banking and investment, but that also makes it ripe for abuse.

521
00:31:57,440 --> 00:32:00,840
It's the first European Union nation to be listed, and could potentially affect the

522
00:32:00,840 --> 00:32:05,360
upward trajectory of Malta as wealthy investors look to alternate locations, given its now

523
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:06,360
tenuous nature.

524
00:32:06,360 --> 00:32:10,920
One of Europe's wealthiest people, and the Czech Republic's richest man, Peter Kellner,

525
00:32:10,920 --> 00:32:15,140
was tragically killed in a helicopter crash while heli-skiing in Alaska, along with four

526
00:32:15,140 --> 00:32:16,760
additional passengers.

527
00:32:16,760 --> 00:32:22,280
Kellner was estimated to be worth $17.5 billion, and his death follows a string of recent fatal

528
00:32:22,280 --> 00:32:26,680
high-profile helicopter accidents, including Kobe Bryant and French billionaire Olivier

529
00:32:26,680 --> 00:32:27,680
Dussault.

530
00:32:27,680 --> 00:32:31,960
On the coast, France and the United Kingdom finally settled some post-Brexit bickering

531
00:32:31,960 --> 00:32:32,960
over fishing.

532
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:36,200
France wanted the British government to issue a number of fishing licenses to small French

533
00:32:36,200 --> 00:32:40,060
boats so they could continue harvesting in British waters, and the Brits stalled, citing

534
00:32:40,060 --> 00:32:42,320
a number of technicalities from the French side.

535
00:32:42,320 --> 00:32:46,360
The issue simmered to a threat of trade sanctions level, but cooler heads prevailed, an agreement

536
00:32:46,360 --> 00:32:51,460
was met, and 83 fishing licenses were assigned before it reached a boiling point.

537
00:32:51,460 --> 00:32:55,020
Another agreement was reached in Spain, but this one pertains to many people's go-to

538
00:32:55,020 --> 00:32:58,140
source for the day's headlines—Google News.

539
00:32:58,140 --> 00:33:01,500
Banned from the country for six years because Spain required Google to pay a central fee

540
00:33:01,500 --> 00:33:06,060
to media organizations for use of their stories, the new law now allows Google parent company

541
00:33:06,060 --> 00:33:09,140
Alphabet to negotiate directly with publishers for content.

542
00:33:09,140 --> 00:33:14,900
Now, more than 1,000 Spanish media organizations can be sourced for news from a single smartphone.

543
00:33:14,900 --> 00:33:18,740
Speaking of smartphones, it may have gone unnoticed in your Apple-happy world, but South

544
00:33:18,740 --> 00:33:23,020
Korean manufacturer LG announced its departure from the phone market.

545
00:33:23,020 --> 00:33:26,780
Once ranked only behind Apple and Samsung for smartphone manufacturing, the company

546
00:33:26,780 --> 00:33:30,660
has had a series of bad reviews and technical rollouts, prompting it to shift its focus

547
00:33:30,660 --> 00:33:35,260
to other areas, such as connected devices for home, robotics, and artificial intelligence.

548
00:33:35,380 --> 00:33:39,700
LG joins Ericsson and HTC in the cell phone graveyard.

549
00:33:39,700 --> 00:33:42,820
Smart is also the way to describe Amazon's accountants.

550
00:33:42,820 --> 00:33:47,440
The company had a record-breaking 2020 in Europe, hauling in some $50 billion, but it

551
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:51,980
managed to pay zero in corporate taxes to Luxembourg, home to its European headquarters.

552
00:33:51,980 --> 00:33:55,660
Of course, it's all legal, but when a company not only doesn't pay anything, but also

553
00:33:55,660 --> 00:34:00,260
declares losses which result in tax credits to the tune of $63 million, there was some

554
00:34:00,260 --> 00:34:04,900
definite eye-rolling and belt-tightening from policymakers looking to benefit from the boom.

555
00:34:05,540 --> 00:34:09,100
The government in Slovenia is running an alleged crusade against culture, with Prime Minister

556
00:34:09,100 --> 00:34:13,180
Jénez Jensa replacing the heads of several arts organizations in what some are calling

557
00:34:13,180 --> 00:34:15,260
a shift to more conservative approaches.

558
00:34:15,260 --> 00:34:19,300
Jensa, who had served twice in the role prior to being ousted for corruption, named new

559
00:34:19,300 --> 00:34:23,380
leaders for the National Museum, the Museum of Contemporary History, and Moderna Galleria,

560
00:34:23,380 --> 00:34:27,820
and he continues to terminate leases from arts organizations that rent space from the

561
00:34:27,820 --> 00:34:28,820
government.

562
00:34:28,820 --> 00:34:32,140
He denies that it's an orchestrated movement, but for many, it's hard to paint over the

563
00:34:32,140 --> 00:34:33,140
facts.

564
00:34:33,380 --> 00:34:37,820
Low government limitations have led to a hot streak of gambling development in Liechtenstein,

565
00:34:37,820 --> 00:34:41,060
one of the world's smallest countries, now home to five casinos.

566
00:34:41,060 --> 00:34:45,580
That may sound like a so-so number, but it puts it per capita above Monaco, Macau, and

567
00:34:45,580 --> 00:34:47,320
Las Vegas' Clark County.

568
00:34:47,320 --> 00:34:48,320
One reason?

569
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:51,900
The gambling tax rate is lower than in neighboring countries, and the government there hasn't

570
00:34:51,900 --> 00:34:54,580
set caps on the number of casinos that can be built.

571
00:34:54,580 --> 00:34:58,080
Five more are in the pipeline, which means the foreign investors largely responsible

572
00:34:58,080 --> 00:35:00,800
for them are betting big on the future.

573
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:04,240
Tensions are rising between Japan and the tandem of China and Russia.

574
00:35:04,240 --> 00:35:07,500
While they've been escalating for years because of Beijing's increased presence

575
00:35:07,500 --> 00:35:12,120
on islands controlled by Japan but claimed by Russia, they hit a new high when a ten-ship

576
00:35:12,120 --> 00:35:16,160
Chinese-Russian flotilla circumnavigated Japan's main island this summer.

577
00:35:16,160 --> 00:35:20,200
China and Russia say it was merely a diplomatic exercise, but Japan is worried a threatening

578
00:35:20,200 --> 00:35:25,080
presence mean it will need to increase defense spending and be more on guard.

579
00:35:25,080 --> 00:35:28,820
Spying seems to be a trend, but the United States told Israel they don't want to play

580
00:35:28,820 --> 00:35:30,000
that game.

581
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:34,200
Daily spyware maker NSO Group was placed on an American blacklist after it was reasonably

582
00:35:34,200 --> 00:35:38,680
confirmed that the NSO's signature product, Pegasus, was used by foreign governments against

583
00:35:38,680 --> 00:35:41,600
dissidents, journalists, diplomats, and clergy members.

584
00:35:41,600 --> 00:35:45,560
The blacklisting means, among other things, that NSO won't be able to buy components

585
00:35:45,560 --> 00:35:49,500
from US companies for its products—something Apple is ensuring after suing the group this

586
00:35:49,500 --> 00:35:51,520
year as well.

587
00:35:51,520 --> 00:35:54,680
Austrian tourism officials want to encourage viewing of the country's nude sculptures

588
00:35:54,680 --> 00:35:58,560
and paintings that pepper museums, but social media platforms' censorship policies have

589
00:35:58,560 --> 00:36:00,200
made their promotion difficult.

590
00:36:00,200 --> 00:36:04,720
So, Vienna did what anyone trying to get around the no private parts policy would do—they

591
00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:08,000
opened an account on the adults-only app Onlyfans.

592
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:11,240
Many of the works are critical to national cultural history, and now they're free to

593
00:36:11,240 --> 00:36:14,440
promote the exhibitions without that fuzzy bar.

594
00:36:14,440 --> 00:36:19,760
2021 wasn't all spying, censorship, and general contention—there were positive developments

595
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:20,760
too.

596
00:36:20,760 --> 00:36:24,840
United States-based dictionary.com named allyship its word of the year.

597
00:36:24,840 --> 00:36:29,100
Originally added to dictionary.com in 2021, allyship rose in popularity during the Black

598
00:36:29,100 --> 00:36:32,720
Lives Matter movements across the world, but its definition makes clear that its applications

599
00:36:32,720 --> 00:36:34,540
are even farther reaching.

600
00:36:34,540 --> 00:36:38,660
One says, quote, the role of a person who advocates for inclusion of a marginalized

601
00:36:38,660 --> 00:36:42,140
or politicized group in solidarity but not as a member.

602
00:36:42,140 --> 00:36:45,640
More word searches means there's certainly more of this going on.

603
00:36:45,640 --> 00:36:49,480
This is a story about the good guy winning, but this time, it's a lobster.

604
00:36:49,480 --> 00:36:53,720
A Canadian grocer noticed that no one was purchasing a certain carrot-colored crustacean,

605
00:36:53,720 --> 00:36:57,760
but on top of that, it was being picked on by other lobsters in the tank.

606
00:36:57,760 --> 00:37:01,320
After several weeks, he bought the lobster himself and donated it to the Toronto Aquarium,

607
00:37:01,320 --> 00:37:06,080
where it was discovered his strange hue was a one in 30 million genetic mutation.

608
00:37:06,080 --> 00:37:11,300
Pinchy, the lobster, avoided the plate and now has a more permanent, public home.

609
00:37:11,300 --> 00:37:14,460
In an effort to speed up the development of more homebuilding in New Zealand, to combat

610
00:37:14,460 --> 00:37:18,880
the 30% increase in housing costs and shortage of inventory, officials are cutting red tape

611
00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:22,620
and making it easier for developers to address a housing crisis so dire that it's drawn

612
00:37:22,620 --> 00:37:23,860
international attention.

613
00:37:23,860 --> 00:37:27,980
Specifically, they're changing some density regulations, allowing for up to three homes

614
00:37:27,980 --> 00:37:32,260
of three stories on one site, versus one home of two stories—a move that some predict

615
00:37:32,260 --> 00:37:37,900
will erect 48,000 to 106,000 new homes in the next five to eight years.

616
00:37:37,900 --> 00:37:41,460
Expansion is something that a Belgian farmer accidentally did when he moved a several hundred

617
00:37:41,460 --> 00:37:43,840
pound stone seven feet into France.

618
00:37:43,840 --> 00:37:47,440
The historic markers delineate the borders between the two countries, and a team of Frenchmen

619
00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:51,820
who patrol the remote countryside verifying the positions noticed the errant stone.

620
00:37:51,820 --> 00:37:56,060
Luckily, the farmer wasn't charged with violating the international treaty that certifies

621
00:37:56,060 --> 00:38:00,140
the border—a crime that could have resulted in a territorial war instead of a slap on

622
00:38:00,140 --> 00:38:01,140
the wrist.

623
00:38:01,140 --> 00:38:05,540
To the north, the United Kingdom is rapidly trying to make up for centuries of contributing

624
00:38:05,540 --> 00:38:06,540
to climate change.

625
00:38:06,540 --> 00:38:10,740
To that end, it launched the world's most powerful tidal turbine off the port of Dundee,

626
00:38:10,740 --> 00:38:14,640
creating enough electricity for 2,000 homes, and Rolls-Royce announced the development

627
00:38:14,640 --> 00:38:19,380
of 16 smaller, cheaper nuclear power plants to electrify one million homes.

628
00:38:19,380 --> 00:38:23,660
Britain is already one of the largest wind energy producers in the world—not bad for

629
00:38:23,660 --> 00:38:26,100
the country that started the Industrial Revolution.

630
00:38:26,100 --> 00:38:29,160
Have you ever heard of Grab or a SPAC?

631
00:38:29,160 --> 00:38:31,060
In this story, we have both.

632
00:38:31,060 --> 00:38:35,780
Grab is a Singapore-based super app that offers everything from ride-sharing to banking in

633
00:38:35,780 --> 00:38:36,780
one tap.

634
00:38:36,780 --> 00:38:41,380
SPAC is a special purpose acquisition company—an investment strategy in which a larger company

635
00:38:41,380 --> 00:38:45,460
merges with a publicly traded shell company in order to exploit going public.

636
00:38:45,460 --> 00:38:50,220
Grab signed a $39.5 billion merger deal with a US SPAC, which brought the company public

637
00:38:50,220 --> 00:38:53,000
on the NASDAQ stock exchange on December 2nd.

638
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:56,240
That makes it the largest ever deal of its kind, and means we should pay attention to

639
00:38:56,240 --> 00:38:59,060
both SPACs and Grab ASAP.

640
00:38:59,060 --> 00:39:03,180
Finland has a lot going for it, including being named the happiest country in the world

641
00:39:03,180 --> 00:39:05,020
for the fourth consecutive year.

642
00:39:05,020 --> 00:39:10,180
But one thing it can't nail is labor retention, and, in fact, one study shows a major reason

643
00:39:10,180 --> 00:39:14,740
foreign students leave Helsinki within their first year of graduating is the language barrier.

644
00:39:14,740 --> 00:39:17,740
These difficulties prompted the mayor to suggest transitioning the capital city to

645
00:39:17,740 --> 00:39:22,340
speaking English primarily—that may help employment, but TBD on happiness.

646
00:39:22,340 --> 00:39:26,260
We've talked a lot about ways to create green energy.

647
00:39:26,260 --> 00:39:29,660
Another way to fight climate change is by consuming less meat, and Denmark is leading

648
00:39:29,660 --> 00:39:34,340
the European Union in this effort by giving $90 million to farmers who produce plant-based

649
00:39:34,340 --> 00:39:36,320
foods over the next five years.

650
00:39:36,320 --> 00:39:40,140
The country eats a lot of pork, but the sale of plant-based foods there has increased by

651
00:39:40,140 --> 00:39:42,720
$8 million in two years.

652
00:39:42,720 --> 00:39:47,000
Things might not fly, and they might not be the only thing on the menu anymore, either.

653
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:50,820
Just to the southwest, officials in the Netherlands unveiled a plan to reduce the country's

654
00:39:50,820 --> 00:39:55,240
livestock by one-third over the next 13 years, but it's for a different reason—there's

655
00:39:55,240 --> 00:39:57,040
too much poop.

656
00:39:57,040 --> 00:40:01,720
The country has over one million cattle, chickens, and pigs—the highest density in Europe—and

657
00:40:01,720 --> 00:40:05,620
can't quite contain their waste without polluting important waterways.

658
00:40:05,620 --> 00:40:09,080
Farmers, naturally, are pushing back, even though the multi-billion dollar plan intends

659
00:40:09,080 --> 00:40:11,560
to pay them to essentially exit the industry.

660
00:40:11,560 --> 00:40:14,720
Maybe they can jump on Denmark's plant-based paddy wagon.

661
00:40:14,720 --> 00:40:18,960
Also planning for the future is the 2032 Olympic Committee, and specifically, Australia.

662
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:22,280
It was announced that Brisbane will be the host of the Summer Games in ten years, and

663
00:40:22,280 --> 00:40:26,000
what's notable about this election isn't the place, but the process.

664
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:29,700
Instead of expensive, competitive, and often corrupt bidding wars pitting cities against

665
00:40:29,700 --> 00:40:33,840
one another, bids are now submitted and then reviewed behind closed doors by selection

666
00:40:33,840 --> 00:40:36,960
committees—in this case, the best mate won.

667
00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:42,120
In Sweden, Magdalena Anderson won but wasn't too happy with her first day on the job, so

668
00:40:42,120 --> 00:40:46,120
the Swedish Prime Minister resigned just 12 hours in because the Junior Green Party also

669
00:40:46,120 --> 00:40:48,920
quit, throwing her coalition into chaos.

670
00:40:48,920 --> 00:40:53,000
She indicated she'd lead a social-Democrat single-party and was re-elected a week later,

671
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:56,640
becoming the first female Prime Minister of Sweden—for a second time.

672
00:40:56,640 --> 00:41:00,880
The second time was not as successful for a criminal in Germany, whose first crime involved

673
00:41:00,880 --> 00:41:02,880
a burglary in 2012.

674
00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:06,880
He got away with that one, and a bite of sausage, which left behind some DNA evidence that the

675
00:41:06,880 --> 00:41:08,240
police held onto.

676
00:41:08,240 --> 00:41:11,600
Fast forward to today, when he committed a more violent crime, and the genetic residue

677
00:41:11,600 --> 00:41:15,560
linked him to the decade-old heist through an international information sharing library.

678
00:41:15,560 --> 00:41:19,800
However, the statute of limitations expired, and he's gone free—proving there's no

679
00:41:19,800 --> 00:41:21,680
bite out of crime this time.

680
00:41:21,680 --> 00:41:25,560
So, we're five from the end, and the truth is a lot of headlines you missed are about

681
00:41:25,560 --> 00:41:30,040
the way these recent, more developed countries are adapting and attacking climate change.

682
00:41:30,040 --> 00:41:34,440
Iceland started operating the world's first direct air capture technology, which turned

683
00:41:34,440 --> 00:41:38,520
CO2 into rock, but perhaps more quirky is that the country also performed the world's

684
00:41:38,520 --> 00:41:42,520
first double arm and shoulder transplant to replace the limbs a man lost in a work accident

685
00:41:42,520 --> 00:41:44,760
more than two decades prior.

686
00:41:44,760 --> 00:41:48,640
Progress on the micro- and macro-level is something to high-five about.

687
00:41:48,640 --> 00:41:55,760
Now a quick disclaimer before this next story—the UN lists 189 HDI scores, and while a vast

688
00:41:55,760 --> 00:41:59,460
majority of those scores correlate to countries, the UN makes sure to acknowledge their list

689
00:41:59,460 --> 00:42:03,840
is a compilation of, quote, 189 countries and UN-recognized territories.

690
00:42:04,240 --> 00:42:08,120
We've now arrived at the only territory on their list, and while technically not a

691
00:42:08,120 --> 00:42:11,400
country, we figured the more news the better so we've gone ahead and included the Chinese

692
00:42:11,400 --> 00:42:13,360
territory of Hong Kong.

693
00:42:13,360 --> 00:42:17,920
Disney Plus finally launched in Hong Kong in 2021, and while much of the streaming service's

694
00:42:17,920 --> 00:42:21,000
content provides a needed escape from the chaos and confusion that's embroiled the

695
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:24,700
Chinese territory in the past few years, one omission from the Simpsons catalog hints at

696
00:42:24,700 --> 00:42:27,520
just how inescapable the tension has become.

697
00:42:27,520 --> 00:42:32,440
Noticeably absent was episode 12 of season 16 that has the Simpson family visiting China,

698
00:42:32,440 --> 00:42:36,220
and specifically Tiananmen Square, and while minor for plot purposes, its disappearance

699
00:42:36,220 --> 00:42:39,880
signals the increasing reach of government censorship in the traditionally independent

700
00:42:39,880 --> 00:42:40,880
city.

701
00:42:40,880 --> 00:42:45,840
The Swiss are notoriously on time, but they were late to join the same-sex marriage party.

702
00:42:45,840 --> 00:42:50,460
The country finally approved a marriage-for-all initiative with two-thirds voting in favor,

703
00:42:50,460 --> 00:42:53,640
becoming one of the last Western European countries to do so.

704
00:42:53,640 --> 00:42:57,560
Switzerland, known for neutrality, is slow on inclusivity issues, and didn't allow

705
00:42:57,560 --> 00:43:02,920
women the right to vote until 1971, so this, though sluggish in adoption, is a cultural

706
00:43:02,920 --> 00:43:03,920
win.

707
00:43:03,920 --> 00:43:07,720
It also took a while for Irish authorities to come down on enforcing the European Union's

708
00:43:07,720 --> 00:43:12,560
three-year-old General Data Protection Regulation, which is a comprehensive data privacy law.

709
00:43:12,560 --> 00:43:17,740
But they served META's WhatsApp with a $270 million fine for not being transparent on

710
00:43:17,740 --> 00:43:21,060
how it uses people's data across the company's platforms.

711
00:43:21,060 --> 00:43:24,640
Many tech companies' headquarters are based in Ireland, where corporate tax rates are

712
00:43:24,640 --> 00:43:28,520
low, so there may be more cases like this, which of course is being contested by WhatsApp,

713
00:43:28,520 --> 00:43:29,720
to come.

714
00:43:29,720 --> 00:43:34,080
And finally, it feels appropriate to end on a note that reminds us about the scale of

715
00:43:34,080 --> 00:43:35,080
humanity.

716
00:43:35,080 --> 00:43:39,480
In Norway, a large meteor lit up the summer night sky for five to six seconds before,

717
00:43:39,480 --> 00:43:43,800
in all likelihood, crashing into a densely wooded area about 40 miles or 60 kilometers

718
00:43:43,800 --> 00:43:45,720
west of the country's capital.

719
00:43:45,720 --> 00:43:49,040
Some people reported a strong wind created by the pressure from it, and while it may

720
00:43:49,040 --> 00:43:53,680
take years to find its physical remains, the blazing meteor, for a fleeting moment, captured

721
00:43:53,720 --> 00:43:58,800
the attention of thousands of onlookers—a rare instance of singularity in an ever-individual

722
00:43:58,800 --> 00:43:59,800
world.

723
00:43:59,800 --> 00:44:04,920
Of course, the news doesn't stop with Norway, nor does it end with the end of the year,

724
00:44:04,920 --> 00:44:08,460
but you don't have to wait for us to highlight interesting stories that may have fallen through

725
00:44:08,460 --> 00:44:09,460
the cracks.

Brew and its informative, quick, witty newsletters are for you.

731
00:44:24,640 --> 00:44:28,480
It's certainly for me, too—look no further than my story from Portugal.

732
00:44:28,480 --> 00:44:32,360
All the information I needed to outline Portugal's unique work-from-home legislation was available

733
00:44:32,360 --> 00:44:35,340
in a quick three-minute read put together by Morning Brew.

734
00:44:35,340 --> 00:44:39,280

00:44:43,160 --> 00:44:46,880
on the pandemic to important statistics on America's current birth rate and its future

737
00:44:46,880 --> 00:44:48,300
impact on the economy.
