00:00.000 --> 00:03.120
Welcome to our year-end review, part two.

00:03.120 --> 00:06.040
If you're tuning in for the first time, this is a special episode during which we

00:06.040 --> 00:09.440
give you one headline from every country in the world from the past year.

00:09.440 --> 00:13.440
The caveat is, hopefully, it's a headline you hadn't heard and has little to do with

00:13.440 --> 00:14.440
the C-word.

00:14.440 --> 00:18.640
We did this last year and we organized countries by population size, counting down from largest

00:18.640 --> 00:19.720
to smallest.

00:19.720 --> 00:23.480
This year, we are doing a count-up organized by the Human Development Index, which is a

00:23.480 --> 00:27.520
number between zero and one determined by the United Nations, based on a series of metrics

00:27.520 --> 00:30.160
including education, longevity, and earnings.

00:30.160 --> 00:33.880
We are halfway through the list and will end with a country that has the highest HDI in

00:33.880 --> 00:34.880
the world.

00:34.880 --> 00:38.560
If you haven't watched part one, we suggest you do that too, where we explain the HDI

00:38.560 --> 00:39.560
breakdown in detail.

00:39.560 --> 00:43.160
If you're joining for part two, thanks, because it means you like part one.

00:43.160 --> 00:45.560
Without delay, here's two.

00:45.560 --> 00:49.480
Distancing themselves is something that a Dutch organization is trying to do with Astrid

00:49.480 --> 00:53.860
Romer, a poet from the former Dutch colony of Suriname, after it awarded her with a prestigious

00:53.860 --> 00:55.880
literary prize earlier this year.

00:55.920 --> 00:59.720
Recently, she made controversial statements supporting murderous former president of Suriname

00:59.720 --> 01:04.080
Desi Buterce, and the Dutch organizers of the award chose to forgo the ceremony honoring

01:04.080 --> 01:07.160
her and simply gave her the cash prize with little fanfare.

01:07.160 --> 01:10.720
Romer, like any real poet, is sticking to her words.

01:10.720 --> 01:14.360
Back underground we go, this time to Petit Mustique, which is part of St. Vincent and

01:14.360 --> 01:18.920
the Grenadines, where a human skull was unearthed on this remote, rugged island in 2003.

01:18.920 --> 01:24.120
And this year, researchers at the University of Oregon may have uncovered why it was there—skeletal

01:24.120 --> 01:28.360
abnormalities show the female likely had leprosy, and this isolated part of the Caribbean was

01:28.360 --> 01:32.000
probably used to keep people with the disease away from the public—something that many

01:32.000 --> 01:34.760
have speculated, but this finding actually supports.

01:34.760 --> 01:39.760
The skull dates back 200 years, and is possibly the earliest case of leprosy recorded in the

01:39.760 --> 01:40.760
Americas.

01:40.760 --> 01:44.160
There is also some speculation that Tunisian president Kayis Said's appointment of a

01:44.160 --> 01:47.760
female prime minister may have been a way to calm critics who say he's overreaching

01:47.760 --> 01:51.080
his power in the Arab Spring's only remaining democracy.

01:51.080 --> 01:55.520
Before Najla Boudin-Ramadanhay's appointment, Said had already suspended Parliament, seized

01:55.520 --> 01:58.800
power, and fired the previous prime minister, and because Ramadanhay doesn't have a lot

01:58.800 --> 02:02.580
of political experience, her trajectory could be challenging—but she is already making

02:02.580 --> 02:06.160
history as the first female prime minister in the Arab world.

02:06.160 --> 02:10.240
The Maldives have the unenvious position of exemplifying climate change's already dire

02:10.240 --> 02:14.300
effects on low-lying nations, where 30% of the country's annual government budget is

02:14.300 --> 02:16.760
being spent on adapting to climate change.

02:16.760 --> 02:20.600
Developed nations have agreed to spend $100 billion to help vulnerable countries adapt,

02:21.120 --> 02:24.040
but Maldives' speaker of parliament wants more—he's asking that rich nations also

02:24.040 --> 02:27.820
pay reparations to help the others deal with the consequences they're already suffering,

02:27.820 --> 02:29.840
and likely didn't cause.

02:29.840 --> 02:33.800
Islands in the Caribbean continue to bet big on tourism, especially countries like Dominica,

02:33.800 --> 02:37.600
which offers citizenship by investment through properties like the six-star resort of Secret

02:37.600 --> 02:38.600
Bay.

02:38.600 --> 02:42.160
For the fifth year in a row, Dominica was named the best country for second citizenship

02:42.160 --> 02:44.200
by Professional Wealth Management magazine.

02:44.200 --> 02:47.840
The second home citizens have primarily come from Africa, but with a new non-stop flight

02:47.840 --> 02:51.640
from Miami running, that could potentially change with Americans starting to look south

02:51.640 --> 02:53.880
for another home and passport.

02:53.880 --> 02:58.120
Added bonus, Dominican residents now get visa-free access to China.

02:58.120 --> 03:02.360
When we say coral reef, you probably say, ugh, that's because a lot of news about

03:02.360 --> 03:06.320
the ocean's critical habitat for fish species is generally bad, and that could have been

03:06.320 --> 03:11.080
the expectation after tropical cyclone Winston caused more than $1.4 billion in damage to

03:11.080 --> 03:16.040
Fiji in 2016 and pummeled the island's reefs, but they've bounced back in a big way as

03:16.040 --> 03:19.960
young coral colonies have taken off, much to the delight of researchers, residents,

03:19.960 --> 03:22.920
and likely the colorful fish that have found a new home.

03:22.920 --> 03:26.920
Also in repair are more than a handful of the 130 precious historical artifacts that

03:26.920 --> 03:30.000
were destroyed in the harbor blast in Lebanon that killed 200 people.

03:30.000 --> 03:33.880
While the objects pale in comparison to human lives, their historical significance remains

03:33.880 --> 03:38.760
important, and that's why the British Museum granted $29,500 in restoration funds to help

03:38.760 --> 03:43.360
repair some of the more critical glass vessels, which are nearly 2,000 years old.

03:43.360 --> 03:47.840
Here on the northwest tip of Africa, an ongoing conflict between Algeria and Morocco might

03:47.840 --> 03:49.280
leave Spain in the cold.

03:49.280 --> 03:53.600
Spain gets about half of its gas from Algeria, which pumps it through a pipeline in Morocco.

03:53.600 --> 03:57.640
Morocco depends on Algeria for about 10% of its gas, and Algeria suspended this pipeline

03:57.640 --> 04:01.600
to both countries to upset Morocco in an ongoing territorial dispute.

04:01.600 --> 04:05.080
It turns out, this may affect Spaniards the most, and we'll still be able to get gas

04:05.080 --> 04:08.440
through alternate routes, but at much higher prices.

04:08.440 --> 04:10.560
Moldova is running out of gas too.

04:10.560 --> 04:14.320
At the end of its contract with Gazprom, Moldova declared a state of emergency when

04:14.320 --> 04:18.040
the Russian energy company raised its gas prices and slashed supply.

04:18.040 --> 04:22.100
Accused of using gas as leverage, allegations have surfaced that contract renegotiations

04:22.100 --> 04:26.120
involve discussion of political issues regarding Moldova's separatist region of Transnistria

04:26.120 --> 04:28.520
and its connection to the EU.

04:28.520 --> 04:32.200
Associated with the EU but reliant on Russian resources, Moldova frequently finds itself

04:32.200 --> 04:36.040
in the unenviable position of sitting between east and west.

04:36.040 --> 04:40.520
From unenviable to regrettable, a mafia fugitive did himself in by appearing on a YouTube cooking

04:40.520 --> 04:43.200
show in his adopted home of the Dominican Republic.

04:43.200 --> 04:47.120
Though he never showed his face while flashing his Italian culinary chops, Mark-friend Claude

04:47.120 --> 04:49.440
Biart's tattoos gave him away to the police.

04:49.440 --> 04:53.020
A member of Italy's largest mafia, who fled Europe when accused of trafficking cocaine

04:53.020 --> 04:58.000
into the Netherlands, Biart led a quiet, unassuming, and, in hindsight, too comfortable life in

04:58.000 --> 04:59.360
the city of Boca Chica.

04:59.360 --> 05:04.220
An apocalyptic scene unfolded just off the coast of Azerbaijan as a column of fire blasted

05:04.220 --> 05:05.520
out of the Caspian Sea.

05:05.520 --> 05:09.620
While the Caspian is dotted by various offshore oil rigs, the assumed culprit for the flare-up

05:09.620 --> 05:13.580
wasn't a leaky Soviet-era pipeline, but one of the region's infamous mud volcanoes

05:13.580 --> 05:14.780
sparking the blast.

05:14.780 --> 05:18.940
Dubbed the Land of Fire, Azerbaijan is home to major oil reserves and hundreds of these

05:18.940 --> 05:22.040
mud volcanoes—many of which are active today.

05:22.040 --> 05:25.540
What happens underground is also of interest in Saint Lucia, where the Caribbean nation

05:25.540 --> 05:28.780
is taking the first steps towards harnessing geothermal energy.

05:28.780 --> 05:32.960
Currently, Saint Lucia relies primarily on diesel generators for power, so any alternative

05:32.960 --> 05:37.320
that would alleviate high energy costs is welcomed, especially one as green as geothermal.

05:37.320 --> 05:41.280
The next step is figuring out viability—a project that will be greatly aided by a $22

05:41.280 --> 05:45.520
million grant made by the World Bank to explore the potential of the energy source.

05:45.520 --> 05:49.920
In Ecuador's most famous islands, Darwin's arch died of natural causes.

05:49.920 --> 05:54.240
Just a kilometer or 0.6 miles off the coast of Darwin Island in the Galapagos, the arch

05:54.240 --> 05:57.840
was a popular destination for divers and photographers.

05:57.840 --> 06:01.160
Ecuadorian officials said that the bridge was brought down by natural erosion.

06:01.160 --> 06:04.840
Year by year, though, erosion is becoming more of a threat and less natural, as volatile

06:04.840 --> 06:08.880
weather and warming waters are intensifying the process that created many of the earth's

06:08.880 --> 06:10.800
arches in the first place.

06:10.800 --> 06:13.520
Another troubling trend came to a head in China.

06:13.520 --> 06:17.160
Birth rates in the world's most populous country hit an all-time low since the country

06:17.160 --> 06:19.880
began tabulating the figure in 1978.

06:19.880 --> 06:24.040
Infamous for its one-child policy, China has began easing restrictions on family size since

06:24.040 --> 06:27.720
2015, as dropping birth rates began to worry state officials.

06:27.720 --> 06:31.200
This year's low watermark, though, hints that the problem may be beyond policy and

06:31.200 --> 06:34.800
expected demographic shifts as the country develops, and more so a function of rising

06:34.800 --> 06:39.220
cost of living and financial insecurity pushing potential parents to hold off.

06:39.220 --> 06:42.320
Birds too are adapting to changing material living conditions.

06:42.320 --> 06:47.000
A study of 77 non-migratory birds undertaken in Brazil has shown that each species has

06:47.000 --> 06:50.180
become smaller in stature over the past 40 years.

06:50.180 --> 06:54.040
This finding, in species confined to remote areas of the Amazon, has allowed researchers

06:54.040 --> 06:58.720
to conclude that the shrinking is in response to the one major alteration in their environment—temperature

06:58.720 --> 06:59.720
rise.

06:59.720 --> 07:02.560
While the researchers haven't come to a consensus, it's hypothesized that the birds

07:02.560 --> 07:06.120
are slimming down because they simply aren't required to generate the same body heat as

07:06.120 --> 07:09.280
in decades prior—humans are doing it for them.

07:09.280 --> 07:14.120
A decision made by Colombia's Congress gave Vicê, often referred to as African-Columbian

07:14.120 --> 07:17.300
moonshine, its well-deserved moment in the sun.

07:17.300 --> 07:21.560
Recognizing the liquor distilled from sugarcane by generations of African-Columbians as a

07:21.560 --> 07:27.160
piece of the country's ancestral and cultural heritage is an honor, and for many, an opportunity.

07:27.160 --> 07:31.260
This notoriety, experts believe, will provide an opportunity for distillers to capitalize

07:31.260 --> 07:35.600
on the product, giving it the chance to follow the same trajectory as Mezcal in Mexico and

07:35.600 --> 07:38.320
to create generational wealth locally.

07:38.320 --> 07:42.720
While other parts of former Yugoslavia threatened to fall apart, North Macedonia celebrated

07:42.720 --> 07:47.960
2021, as the year marked the 30th anniversary of its peacefully established independence.

07:47.960 --> 07:52.400
A military parade through the capital of Skopje and celebrations across the country marked

07:52.400 --> 07:53.400
the occasion.

07:53.400 --> 07:57.620
While independent for decades, integration into the West has been a winding road as disputes

07:57.620 --> 08:01.840
with Greece saw the country relinquish its original name, Macedonia, for its current

08:01.840 --> 08:03.400
moniker.

08:03.400 --> 08:07.200
Another milestone was reached this year when Joe Biden became the first US President to

08:07.200 --> 08:10.960
acknowledge that the Armenian Genocide was, in fact, a genocide.

08:10.960 --> 08:15.320
In Armenia, and across the Armenian diaspora, the news was welcomed with a tepid response

08:15.320 --> 08:19.160
not because of the 106 years of separation from the event, but because the declaration

08:19.160 --> 08:21.900
is, of course, merely a declaration.

08:21.900 --> 08:25.580
Many see the statement as a symbolic gesture designed to test the relationship with Turkey,

08:25.580 --> 08:29.540
who has yet to qualify the historic atrocity as a genocide.

08:29.540 --> 08:33.980
A move that may have large repercussions caught the eye of free speech advocates worldwide

08:33.980 --> 08:38.600
when Thailand's government banned the dissemination of news that quote, causes public fear.

08:38.600 --> 08:42.540
The government framed the mandate as a move to limit the dangerous spread of disinformation,

08:42.540 --> 08:44.260
but critics see it differently.

08:44.260 --> 08:47.940
The ban, which allows the government to block individuals' internet access, conveniently

08:47.940 --> 08:53.220
materialized just as criticism with the government's slow rollout of vaccines hit fever pitch.

08:53.220 --> 08:57.820
For Peru's conservative right, there's been no escaping fear-inducing news in 2021,

08:57.820 --> 09:02.300
as a narrow election saw the swearing in of Socialist President Pedro Castillo.

09:02.300 --> 09:06.660
The rise of the rural teacher-turned-politician caught the world off guard and certainly didn't

09:06.660 --> 09:09.960
sit right with the country's established power brokers, who immediately contested the

09:09.960 --> 09:13.060
result and whose supporters harassed election officials.

09:13.060 --> 09:17.300
Only months in, Castillo's presidency is barely holding on as his approval rating has

09:17.340 --> 09:21.180
plummeted, and a possible move to impeach hangs in the balance.

09:21.180 --> 09:25.320
A world record also hung in the balance this year, as spectators along an Antiguan harbor

09:25.320 --> 09:29.320
anxiously awaited the appearance of Jasmine Harrison's rowboat on the horizon.

09:29.320 --> 09:32.900
She and her boat eventually pulled into the waters of Antigua and Barbuda, the nation

09:32.900 --> 09:36.740
that marks the finish line of the Talisker Whiskey Atlantic Challenge, and Harrison became

09:36.740 --> 09:41.700
the youngest woman to row the Atlantic solo—a 70-day long odyssey that saw her thrown overboard

09:41.700 --> 09:44.620
twice, and her medal tested constantly.

09:44.620 --> 09:47.840
Moving to the end of their own odyssey is the Scythian gold.

09:47.840 --> 09:51.560
This year, a Dutch court ruled that the trove of Crimean treasures dating back to the days

09:51.560 --> 09:54.520
of the Silk Road rightfully belonged to Ukraine.

09:54.520 --> 09:58.780
On display in 2014, when Russia annexed the peninsula, the fate of these cultural artifacts

09:58.780 --> 10:01.780
has been in limbo for years before this ruling.

10:01.780 --> 10:05.620
Russia has criticized the ruling, while Ukraine has labeled this another recognition of the

10:05.620 --> 10:08.700
world's condemnation over Russia's seizure of the peninsula.

10:08.700 --> 10:11.580
In Saint Kitts and Nevis, the story's apiculture.

10:11.580 --> 10:16.220
Now, if you aren't a former G.O.B. champion with an expansive vocabulary, you may not

10:16.220 --> 10:18.840
recognize the place nor the practice.

10:18.840 --> 10:23.220
All the same, the Crimean nation of 50,000 joined an international effort to help launch

10:23.220 --> 10:25.940
and support local beekeeping businesses.

10:25.940 --> 10:29.500
If properly executed, the initiative will create additional jobs, bring local honey

10:29.500 --> 10:34.220
and wax products to market, and help protect biodiversity by keeping pollinators, well,

10:34.220 --> 10:35.220
buzzing.

10:35.220 --> 10:40.260
West of where a bulk of bees is set to soon buzz, Mexican politicians and activists battled.

10:40.260 --> 10:44.380
After much debate, it was announced that Mexico's 150-year-old Columbus statue was

10:44.380 --> 10:47.140
to be replaced by a statue of an indigenous woman.

10:47.140 --> 10:51.140
A reasonable decision at surface level, and one that recognizes two oft-overlooked groups

10:51.140 --> 10:55.500
in Mexico, women, and indigenous people, some see the move as political posturing by Mayor

10:55.500 --> 10:59.620
Claudia Chabon, one that wins her positive PR without actually helping the plight of

10:59.620 --> 11:02.300
indigenous Mexicans or women.

11:02.300 --> 11:06.260
From statues in metaphorical hot water to those physically under it, Granada announced

11:06.260 --> 11:09.820
the completion of a renovation to its underwater sculpture park.

11:10.380 --> 11:13.100
The repairs and cleaning of already existing sculptures were part of the project, but the

11:13.100 --> 11:18.200
most exciting bit was the new 82-piece installation celebrating Grenadian culture.

11:18.200 --> 11:22.600
Since its creation in 2006, the park has offered habitat for marine wildlife and served as

11:22.600 --> 11:27.460
an important tourist draw—the renovation aims to maintain that positive momentum.

11:27.460 --> 11:31.380
Though hard to imagine, things are getting more complicated in a country with two names

11:31.380 --> 11:32.820
and three presidents.

11:32.820 --> 11:37.580
Calling it a quote, existential threat, one top American diplomat flew to Bosnia-Herzegovina

11:37.580 --> 11:41.980
to coax Bosnian Serb leader Milorad Dodik to lighten his separatist rhetoric that, if

11:41.980 --> 11:45.980
acted on, would potentially nosedive the nation and destabilize the region.

11:45.980 --> 11:50.580
The epicenter of ethnic violence in the mid-1990s that took painstaking negotiations to quell,

11:50.580 --> 11:55.060
a separatist move like the one Dodik threatens would set the region back decades.

11:55.060 --> 11:59.860
If nothing else good came of it, the pandemic offered zoo animals a well-earned rest.

11:59.860 --> 12:04.500
In Sri Lanka, where zoos closed in March of 2020 and have only briefly opened since, animals

12:04.500 --> 12:08.540
have taken the newfound peace and quiet to deeper relationships and spend a lot of time

12:08.540 --> 12:09.540
in bed.

12:09.540 --> 12:13.940
The result was a baby boom, as some species—the black swan and white peacock—made it in

12:13.940 --> 12:18.260
Sri Lankan zoos for the first time ever, while others such as lions have accelerated their

12:18.260 --> 12:21.620
output in lieu of nosy onlookers.

12:21.620 --> 12:25.700
Perhaps the world could have used a few more nosy onlookers in the Seal of Oman this year,

12:25.700 --> 12:29.960
as noted not-friends Iran and the US offered wildly different accounts as to what really

12:29.960 --> 12:33.700
happened when Iran seized an oil tanker just off its coast.

12:33.700 --> 12:37.100
Cuban officials claim that the US had taken their tanker before their successful naval

12:37.100 --> 12:41.380
assault reclaimed the ship, while the US officials say that it was a Vietnamese tanker that Iran

12:41.380 --> 12:42.500
had seized.

12:42.500 --> 12:46.640
Regardless of who's telling the truth, this most recent rift offers a reminder of just

12:46.640 --> 12:50.500
how rocky the relationships between the two nations remain.

12:50.500 --> 12:52.780
Cuban officials wouldn't be fooled twice this year.

12:52.780 --> 12:56.660
After the largest protests in 30 years caught them off guard in July, the government made

12:56.660 --> 13:00.000
sure to stamp out the next protest before it even started.

13:00.000 --> 13:04.600
As news spread of a potential pro-democracy, freedom of expression demonstration, the state

13:04.600 --> 13:08.080
didn't let noted protestors leave their homes, arrested congregators, and released

13:08.080 --> 13:12.760
media claiming that protests were an attempt of regime change by the hands of the US.

13:12.760 --> 13:16.960
One European country has proved especially welcome to Afghan refugees, and it's one

13:16.960 --> 13:18.680
of the continent's poorest.

13:18.680 --> 13:22.960
Albania, bolstered by a country familiar with and receptive to immigrants, pledged to take

13:22.960 --> 13:25.720
in as many as 4,000 Afghans.

13:25.720 --> 13:30.360
The nearly 700 that made it to the coastal nation were put up in beachside resorts.

13:30.360 --> 13:34.600
Albania is likely just a year-long stop for refugees as they seek to secure visas to countries

13:34.600 --> 13:37.960
that offer more opportunity, but Albania has made it clear that they're more than welcome

13:37.960 --> 13:40.240
to stay should they want to.

13:40.240 --> 13:44.280
Michael B. Jordan understands first-hand the baggage that comes with a name.

13:44.280 --> 13:48.120
Perhaps that's why the actor was willing to change the name of his new rum brand, initially

13:48.120 --> 13:52.480
called Juvert, once Trinidad and Tobagoans took offense to his trademarking the term

13:52.480 --> 13:55.280
that refers to the opening of their famed Carnaval.

13:55.280 --> 13:59.280
Labeling the act as cultural appropriation, thousands from Trinidad and Tobago signed

13:59.280 --> 14:03.840
an online petition to protect and respect a word that means so much to their culture.

14:03.840 --> 14:07.440
The coca de mer, a palm tree that produces the world's largest and, subjectively the

14:07.440 --> 14:10.920
most inappropriate seed in the world, only exists in Seychelles.

14:10.920 --> 14:15.700
In fact, the tree only grows on two of the archipelago's 115 islands while the rare

14:15.700 --> 14:20.640
seed, sold mostly to bemused tourists, fetches up to $260.

14:20.640 --> 14:24.800
Beloved by islanders, heavily regulated by the government, and yet still endangered,

14:25.320 --> 14:28.880
Seychelles is taking a new approach to conserving the tree by putting seeds in the hands of

14:28.880 --> 14:29.880
locals.

14:29.880 --> 14:33.060
Those interested in growing the tree on their property can apply for the honor and must

14:33.060 --> 14:37.280
prove they have enough room and the right soil for the palm to take off.

14:37.280 --> 14:41.500
Sending mail to the Chagos Archipelago became a bit more difficult this year.

14:41.500 --> 14:44.960
Recognizing Mauritius' sovereignty over the chain of islands that's now one of Britain's

14:44.960 --> 14:49.180
last and most controversial colonial holdings, the UN's postal union decided it would no

14:49.180 --> 14:53.360
longer recognize postage stamps issued by the British Indian Overseas Territory of the

14:53.360 --> 14:54.360
UK.

14:54.920 --> 14:57.940
This move adds ever so slightly to the pressure on Britain to leave the chain and represents

14:57.940 --> 15:02.040
another baby step towards returning home for Chagossians forcibly relocated to Mauritius

15:02.040 --> 15:03.600
decades ago.

15:03.600 --> 15:07.440
Cristiano Ronaldo couldn't wait to get home after a controversial call in Serbia cost

15:07.440 --> 15:10.840
him and his country important World Cup qualifying points.

15:10.840 --> 15:15.240
However, throwing his captain's armband down in disgust as he exited the pitch unintentionally

15:15.240 --> 15:20.680
did a world of good for a six-month-old Serbian boy with spinal muscular atrophy.

15:20.680 --> 15:24.520
Added to a charity group who then auctioned off the armband, Ronaldo's frustration resulted

15:24.520 --> 15:30.720
in a $71,000 haul—money which went directly to the six-month-old's treatment.

15:30.720 --> 15:34.380
In Kuwait, things aren't looking quite as dire for those nearing the other end of the

15:34.380 --> 15:38.600
age spectrum as the country's legislator reversed a ban on employing expatriates over

15:38.600 --> 15:40.160
the age of 60.

15:40.160 --> 15:44.040
Struck down because it had no legal basis, the ruling serves as just a respite for the

15:44.040 --> 15:48.080
nation's expat population, who have been leaving by the thousands as the state continues

15:48.080 --> 15:52.280
to push for the development of its domestic workforce through its years-long Kuwaitization

15:52.280 --> 15:53.280
project.

15:53.280 --> 15:57.200
A more substantial legal ruling was recorded this year in Malaysia, as the country's

15:57.200 --> 16:02.080
highest court ruled that the Islamic provision that banned same-sex acts was unconstitutional.

16:02.080 --> 16:07.160
LGBTQ advocates have called the ruling historic, as the country experienced an uptick in homophobic

16:07.160 --> 16:09.120
sentiment in recent years.

16:09.120 --> 16:13.640
This ruling, though, does not legalize same-sex acts, as a civil law from Britain's colonial

16:13.640 --> 16:16.680
era banning those is still on the books.

16:16.680 --> 16:20.840
Costa Rica earned some well-deserved national attention, but the country was named one of

16:20.840 --> 16:25.280
the five winners of the Earthshot Prize—a global sustainability effort spearheaded by

16:25.280 --> 16:27.800
Prince William and Kate Middleton.

16:27.800 --> 16:32.540
Financed largely by taxes on fossil fuels, Costa Rica has handed more than $500 million

16:32.540 --> 16:36.740
to landowners over the past 20 years to protect forests and watersheds.

16:36.740 --> 16:40.120
The effort has largely reversed deforestation in the country.

16:40.120 --> 16:44.460
While the prize money is nice, the international recognition serves as a proof of concept for

16:44.460 --> 16:49.000
other nations, and a pat on the back for forward-thinking Costa Rica.

16:49.000 --> 16:51.940
Forward-thinking was the praise Georgia thought it might reap when the country broke ground

16:51.940 --> 16:55.580
on its, quote, hyper-modern Parliament building a decade ago.

16:55.580 --> 17:00.220
Today, though, it sits empty, and its glass windows meant to signal government transparency

17:00.220 --> 17:01.640
gather dust.

17:01.640 --> 17:05.180
Done in by its distance from the capital and the new political regime's distaste for

17:05.180 --> 17:09.740
it, the building was abandoned in 2018, then put up for sale through May of 2021, when

17:09.740 --> 17:12.940
the government finally gave up on finding a buyer.

17:12.940 --> 17:17.660
As Georgia gave up on its governmental greenhouse, Oman announced their aim to build a massive

17:17.660 --> 17:19.340
green hydrogen plant.

17:19.340 --> 17:23.420
Oman's following the forward-thinking theme by working to smooth an impending economic

17:23.420 --> 17:28.700
transition as 85% of the country's GDP is generated from oil and gas—resources which

17:28.700 --> 17:30.740
the country is quickly running out of.

17:30.740 --> 17:34.620
Powered by wind and solar, it's hoped that the $30 billion project will be producing

17:34.620 --> 17:37.980
and exporting renewable energy at full capacity by 2038.

17:37.980 --> 17:42.140
In the very same year that Barbados ended symbolic ties with the Queen of England and

17:42.140 --> 17:47.340
became a republic, the nation's most famous export, Rihanna, became a national hero.

17:47.340 --> 17:51.540
Well, technically the artist, entrepreneur, and proud Bajan has been a national icon in

17:51.540 --> 17:55.540
the country for more than a decade, but this year her legendary status became official

17:55.540 --> 17:59.300
when the new republic's prime minister designated her a national hero.

17:59.300 --> 18:03.340
Already an ambassador for the Caribbean country, and recently named the world's richest female

18:03.340 --> 18:07.520
musician, it seems that Rihanna's reign just won't let up, and Barbados is all the

18:07.520 --> 18:09.140
better for it.

18:09.140 --> 18:14.140
At the other end of the Caribbean, three Cubans survived 33 days on a barren Bahamian island

18:14.140 --> 18:16.540
before being rescued by the US Coast Guard.

18:16.540 --> 18:20.660
After capsizing at sea, likely in an attempt to flee Cuba, the three washed up on one of

18:20.660 --> 18:25.720
the least hospitable Bahamas, surviving on coconut water, conch shells, and rats.

18:25.720 --> 18:29.480
After receiving brief medical attention in Florida, the resourceful survivors were handed

18:29.480 --> 18:32.420
over to US Immigration and Customs Enforcement.

18:32.420 --> 18:35.500
This isn't the first time the Bahamas have found itself as the meeting point between

18:35.500 --> 18:39.980
Cuban defectors and the US, as a similar rescue took place a few islands over, not months

18:39.980 --> 18:41.340
before this one.

18:41.340 --> 18:45.180
The Bahamas have hardly been the focal point for dangerous American migrations, though.

18:45.180 --> 18:50.180
It's been a record-breaking year for Panama immigration officials as a whopping 70,000

18:50.180 --> 18:54.040
migrants from around the world have passed through the Darien Gap and into the country.

18:54.040 --> 18:58.660
Such incredible numbers making their way through the undeveloped, densely forested, and crime-riddled

18:58.660 --> 19:03.120
route with no formal roadways has pushed Panamanian and Colombian officials to begin regulating

19:03.120 --> 19:08.000
the number of entrants into the Darien Gap—potentially a first step in making the journey safer for

19:08.000 --> 19:10.280
the desperate migrants.

19:10.280 --> 19:13.600
International collaboration was the context that informed an embarrassing development

19:13.600 --> 19:14.840
in Bulgaria.

19:14.840 --> 19:19.920
Led by the US Army, the NATO military exercise called Swift Response brought together 7,000

19:19.920 --> 19:23.280
paratroopers from ten member nations for some joint practice.

19:23.280 --> 19:27.480
Swift Response, though, quickly became seriously regrettable when American soldiers accidentally

19:27.480 --> 19:32.400
left the training zone and barged into and cleared out a Bulgarian sunflower oil factory.

19:32.400 --> 19:36.640
The factory has since filed a lawsuit while the US Embassy, for its part, has apologized

19:36.640 --> 19:38.400
for the mistake.

19:38.400 --> 19:42.160
Netflix further expanded its reach when it greenlit the company's first feature-length

19:42.160 --> 19:44.020
film shot in Uruguay.

19:44.020 --> 19:48.200
The company's VP of Latin American Content has hailed the project as an exciting opportunity

19:48.200 --> 19:50.280
to highlight the creative talent in the country.

19:50.280 --> 19:54.400
While it's unlikely that viewers will recognize names when the credits roll, the film, named

19:54.400 --> 19:58.680
Togo, will fit right in in the current cinematic canon as the crime revolves around street-level

19:58.680 --> 20:01.440
drug trafficking and organized crime.

20:01.480 --> 20:05.640
Following the appearance of mysterious metallic monoliths across the American West and in

20:05.640 --> 20:09.920
Romania, a similar structure appeared in southwest Turkey, but this one came with a message in

20:09.920 --> 20:14.120
ancient Turkish—quote, look at the sky and you will see the moon.

20:14.120 --> 20:17.480
Residents didn't have to wait long on an explanation as to the origins of the structure

20:17.480 --> 20:21.440
and its innocuous truism, though, as only days after its discovery, President Erdogan

20:21.440 --> 20:25.080
used the monolith as a background when he announced the country's new space program

20:25.080 --> 20:30.000
and ten-year vision, proving the monolith's function as an eye-rolling gimmick.

20:30.040 --> 20:33.800
By overlooking tradition at the Tokyo Olympics, one sprinter, rather than running for her

20:33.800 --> 20:36.040
country, ran away from it.

20:36.040 --> 20:39.440
Accusing her coaches of negligence before being pulled from her event and pressured

20:39.440 --> 20:44.040
to return home to Belarus, Kristina Sayu-Muskaja fled to the Polish embassy where she was granted

20:44.040 --> 20:45.660
a humanitarian visa.

20:45.660 --> 20:50.240
The incident exemplifies the mounting pressure on Belarusian public figures under the country's

20:50.240 --> 20:54.280
increasingly authoritarian government as she joins a growing list of athletes, coaches,

20:54.280 --> 20:58.520
and high-profile Belarusians that have faced job loss, arrest, or imprisonment when voicing

20:58.520 --> 21:01.800
discontent with the government in the past two years.

21:01.800 --> 21:05.620
State overreach is also the fear in Russia, as the Moscow Metro has implemented a new

21:05.620 --> 21:09.260
method of payment at over 240 stations called FacePay.

21:09.260 --> 21:13.600
As the program's name suggests, Moscow commuters can now leave their phone and wallet at home

21:13.600 --> 21:15.800
and simply smile for the camera to board the train.

21:15.800 --> 21:19.560
In a country where governmental transparency is hard to come by and facial recognition

21:19.560 --> 21:23.880
has been allegedly used to identify protestors, FacePay has human rights groups and dubious

21:23.880 --> 21:27.780
citizens concerned by the project's potential ulterior motives.

21:27.780 --> 21:31.500
In another former Soviet state, government officials made a statement as to where their

21:31.500 --> 21:36.220
current allegiances lie when they kicked out an outspoken US-Russian dual national.

21:36.220 --> 21:40.260
Receiving a letter notifying he was barred from entry into Kazakhstan, Gene Bunnan, who

21:40.260 --> 21:44.460
founded a victim's database to track the incarceration of Uyghurs in western China,

21:44.460 --> 21:48.680
serves as an example as to how closely Kazakhstan has come to align itself with China, not only

21:48.680 --> 21:53.260
turning a blind eye to what the US and UN have come to define as genocide, but now seemingly

21:53.260 --> 21:56.860
helping to quiet dissent within its own borders.

21:56.940 --> 22:00.560
While some bonds are strengthening in Central Asia, others in the Pacific are beginning

22:00.560 --> 22:01.700
to crumble.

22:01.700 --> 22:06.060
The result of a vote on the new Secretary-General for the Pacific Islands Forum was the last

22:06.060 --> 22:09.740
straw for the tiny Micronesian country of Palau, who announced they'd be leaving the

22:09.740 --> 22:10.740
organization.

22:10.740 --> 22:14.740
The coalition long had an informal tradition of rotating its Secretary-General position

22:14.740 --> 22:19.640
between Micronesian, Polynesian, and Melanesian politicians, but the election of a Cook Islands

22:19.640 --> 22:23.720
politician was a break from convention that left Micronesian nations like Palau and other

22:23.720 --> 22:27.240
small island states that would follow their lead, feeling slighted and voiceless in the

22:27.240 --> 22:29.400
organization's proceedings.

22:29.400 --> 22:33.140
Trophy hunting of large carnivores is banned in Romania, but that didn't stop Prince

22:33.140 --> 22:37.520
Emmanuel von Unzerlichtenstein of Austria from shooting the country's, and potentially

22:37.520 --> 22:40.160
the European Union's, single largest brown bear.

22:40.160 --> 22:43.880
While the Prince had authorization from the Romanian government to hunt a female nuisance

22:43.880 --> 22:48.640
bear causing problems for a small farm town, he managed to bag the massive 17-year-old

22:48.640 --> 22:53.000
Arthur, whether by accident or intentionally, is under investigation.

22:53.000 --> 22:57.060
In another mountainous Eastern European country, construction crews put the finishing touches

22:57.060 --> 23:00.500
on a state-of-the-art highway that cuts through rugged Montenegro.

23:00.500 --> 23:04.140
Rather than celebrating, though, residents are beginning to ask questions about the road's

23:04.140 --> 23:05.500
one billion dollar price tag.

23:05.500 --> 23:09.880
The road only connects a few small communities, including the town at its terminus, Matasevo,

23:09.880 --> 23:11.980
home to a population of 15.

23:11.980 --> 23:16.700
An early Belt and Road project built by Chinese crews, Montenegro's finances are now seriously

23:16.700 --> 23:20.560
strained by the road that really doesn't serve much of a purpose.

23:20.560 --> 23:24.720
The people of Brunei are hoping for more sage decision-making from the new CEO of the

23:24.720 --> 23:29.240
nation's largest financial institution, Bank Islam Brunei Dar Es Salaam.

23:29.240 --> 23:33.940
Hij Nouriani will be the first female CEO of the bank that manages $10 billion of assets

23:33.940 --> 23:38.060
and has expanded across Southeast Asia and into the Middle East in recent years.

23:38.060 --> 23:42.700
After naming three women to top positions in 2019, the move follows an empowering trend

23:42.700 --> 23:45.660
at the bank in the traditionally conservative country.

23:45.660 --> 23:50.540
In Argentina, a 30-year-old confirmed an age-old maxim—if it's too good to be true, then

23:50.540 --> 23:52.320
true, it usually is.

23:52.320 --> 23:56.260
Searching for an explanation for a momentary Google outage, Nicolas Corona found that the

23:56.260 --> 24:02.400
domain google.com.ar had expired, and that he could buy it for a modest $2.60.

24:02.400 --> 24:06.380
The Argentine quickly scooped up the domain that, if everything broke his way, could be

24:06.380 --> 24:08.200
worth millions.

24:08.200 --> 24:11.920
The domain didn't prove a golden ticket, though, but a mistake as Google's ownership

24:11.920 --> 24:17.440
hadn't lapsed, but in the end, Corona came out of the situation a few dollars lighter.

24:17.460 --> 24:20.300
And a country that's been in the headlines for all the wrong reasons in the past few

24:20.300 --> 24:23.000
years has emerged a more positive story.

24:23.000 --> 24:27.440
Rolls-Royce and Qatar announced a multi-year, multi-billion dollar partnership aimed to

24:27.440 --> 24:29.600
foster green technology companies.

24:29.600 --> 24:33.880
The partnership will build two campuses, one in each country, create an estimated 1,000

24:33.880 --> 24:37.920
jobs, and hopefully provide the resources and facilities for sustainability-oriented

24:37.920 --> 24:40.200
startups to take off.

24:40.200 --> 24:45.180
Prosecc and Prosecco are two different types of wine with two different names.

24:45.180 --> 24:49.860
Almost how different the names are, though, has Croatia and Italy at loggerheads.

24:49.860 --> 24:53.200
Croatia has sought to trademark the name of their Prosecc with the European Commission

24:53.200 --> 24:57.540
under the assumption that consumers would be able to differentiate it from Italian Prosecco.

24:57.540 --> 25:01.460
Italian wine aficionados think differently, and are fighting the move on account of potential

25:01.460 --> 25:02.500
confusion.

25:02.500 --> 25:06.720
Italians also see the effort as an attack on Italian products more broadly, as Prosecco

25:06.720 --> 25:13.100
is a denomination of controlled origin—a wine that only comes from a specific region.

25:13.100 --> 25:18.180
The world's largest mammal, the blue whale, only feeds in a few specific regions—one

25:18.180 --> 25:20.780
of which is off the coast of Chilean Patagonia.

25:20.780 --> 25:24.820
Unfortunately for the endangered species, the water is also teeming with fishing vessels

25:24.820 --> 25:29.000
working the busy salmon farming industry, with up to 1,000 boats a day passing through

25:29.000 --> 25:30.300
the feeding grounds.

25:30.300 --> 25:34.500
This traffic has led to a handful of fatal collisions between boat and blue whale.

25:34.500 --> 25:38.420
With the regional population estimated to be only in the hundreds, conservationists

25:38.420 --> 25:42.820
are scrambling to figure out a compromise that gives the whales a bit more room.

25:42.860 --> 25:47.300
Bahrain is keen on finding a bit more room, too—so keen, in fact, that the archipelago

25:47.300 --> 25:51.140
nation announced plans to expand its landmass by 60%.

25:51.140 --> 25:55.020
The island-building initiative will enlarge Bahrain's footprint, construct five new

25:55.020 --> 25:59.260
cities, and, the government hopes, attract billions in foreign investment.

25:59.260 --> 26:04.340
The project is set to build out tourist attractions, a sports city, and a commercial zone.

26:04.340 --> 26:09.380
From sports cities to sports washing, it was a big year for professional athletics in Saudi

26:09.380 --> 26:10.380
Arabia.

26:10.380 --> 26:14.600
Despite its high-profile, highly controversial takeover of Newcastle United, the country

26:14.600 --> 26:18.320
also announced a partnership between Gulf Saudi and the Asian tour that'll keep a

26:18.320 --> 26:22.740
Saudi stomp on Asia's preeminent Gulf circuit and provide prize funding for a decade to

26:22.740 --> 26:23.740
come.

26:23.740 --> 26:27.540
While a quieter development than the Newcastle deal, many denounced the move as another attempt

26:27.540 --> 26:31.820
to move conversation and attention away from the country's human rights record with glitz

26:31.820 --> 26:33.280
and games.

26:33.280 --> 26:37.660
Issues with human rights records will be impossible to miss if the Chinese Fudan University is

26:37.660 --> 26:40.980
to follow through with building a campus in Budapest, Hungary.

26:40.980 --> 26:44.260
Many of the city's population oppose the project, and the city's mayor has called

26:44.260 --> 26:47.660
it an instance of, quote, Chinese influence buying.

26:47.660 --> 26:51.540
Residents are becoming increasingly creative in their pushback, recently renaming nearby

26:51.540 --> 26:55.360
streets Uyghur Martyrs, Dalai Lama, and Free Hong Kong Road.

26:55.360 --> 26:59.700
One car skipped the streets entirely on its way from the Nitra Airport in Slovakia to

26:59.700 --> 27:04.580
that in Bratislava—instead, the prototype flew the 35-minute route.

27:04.580 --> 27:09.620
For Klein Vision's aircar, it was the 142nd landing, but an important first too as the

27:09.620 --> 27:13.460
car successfully transitioned into normal car mode in just minutes.

27:13.460 --> 27:17.160
While behind on the timeline that science fiction authors envisioned, flying cars are

27:17.160 --> 27:21.260
slowly coming around with Klein, Hyundai, and GM leading the way.

27:21.260 --> 27:25.060
Portugal's parliament pushed into the future of labor when it passed progressive measures

27:25.060 --> 27:27.460
to protect its increasingly online workforce.

27:27.460 --> 27:31.960
In response to the shift to working from home, new laws bar employers from contacting employees

27:31.960 --> 27:35.760
during off-hours, allow parents of children under eight to work from home without bosses'

27:35.760 --> 27:39.820
approval, and require employers to pitch in on employees' electricity costs.

27:39.820 --> 27:43.240
The move comes in response to the pandemic, but also as an effort to protect Portugal's

27:43.240 --> 27:47.960
reputation as an attractive place for digital nomads to set up shop.

27:47.960 --> 27:52.000
Finding the remains of a different sort of nomad in Latvia cast doubt on previous theories

27:52.000 --> 27:56.720
as to the dramatic decline of Stone Age peoples across Western Europe 5,000 years ago.

27:56.720 --> 28:01.460
DNA analysis of a hunter-gatherer showed the man died of the plague, making him the earliest

28:01.460 --> 28:04.580
victim of what was thought to have caused the mysterious population decline.

28:04.580 --> 28:08.860
Analysis, however, also showed that the strain he carried didn't spread easily, and caused

28:08.860 --> 28:11.340
milder symptoms than iterations that would follow.

28:11.340 --> 28:16.420
Now, rather than plague, scientists are looking at climate change as a catalyst.

28:16.420 --> 28:19.740
Successful Spanish YouTubers are making like wealthy bankers and professional athletes

28:19.740 --> 28:22.660
before them, and running to the hills of Andorra.

28:22.660 --> 28:26.420
One Spanish creator called Andorra the quote, Silicon Valley of YouTube, as the country

28:26.420 --> 28:30.460
has quickly developed into a creative meeting place, luring in the like-minded with light

28:30.460 --> 28:34.140
taxes, relative anonymity, and less stringent lockdown policies.

28:34.140 --> 28:38.580
The move has been a boon for Andorra's sputtering economy, and a real loss for Spain's, where

28:38.580 --> 28:43.500
local media has gone so far as to call Spanish YouTubers relocating unpatriotic.

28:43.500 --> 28:48.540
A sputtering economy, many feel, would be the result should Poland pivot away from coal.

28:48.540 --> 28:52.740
Currently, 70% of the country's energy comes from the non-renewable super polluter, and

28:52.740 --> 28:56.140
coal companies and miner unions hold serious political power.

28:56.140 --> 28:59.660
But Poland's appetite, and the massive strip mine on its border, are running Czech wells

28:59.860 --> 29:02.860
dry, or at least so the Czech Republic accuses.

29:02.860 --> 29:07.340
Citing European environmental laws, the Czech Republic has sued Poland, setting off a wave

29:07.340 --> 29:10.900
of conspiracy theories across coal country.

29:10.900 --> 29:13.920
Conspiratorial might seem like a good way to describe Lithuania's defense ministry

29:13.920 --> 29:17.780
calling for citizens to throw their Chinese-made cell phones away.

29:17.780 --> 29:21.740
The request, though, comes after the nation's cybersecurity center found that the Shomi

29:21.740 --> 29:26.940
Corp, a Chinese phone maker, have censored technology built into devices that track 449

29:26.940 --> 29:30.820
terms, including the likes of Free Tibet and Democracy Movement.

29:30.820 --> 29:35.860
The finding comes as relationships between China and Lithuania sour over Taiwan.

29:35.860 --> 29:41.020
One internationally recognized state, one defiant self-identifying state, two UK military

29:41.020 --> 29:46.240
bases, and one UN buffer zone to keep the peace hint at Cyprus' geopolitical complexity.

29:46.240 --> 29:50.280
Things didn't get any simpler in 2021, when Turkish President Erdogan announced that in

29:50.280 --> 29:54.420
celebration of the 47th anniversary of Turkey invading the island, the country planned to

29:54.420 --> 29:58.200
resettle an abandoned and formerly Greek Cypriot tourist town.

29:58.200 --> 30:01.620
Celebrating an invasion with a different sort of invasion has received poor marks from the

30:01.620 --> 30:04.700
US, the UN, and Greek Cypriots.

30:04.700 --> 30:09.860
While heated geopolitical relations and politicians' hot air pose a threat in the Mediterranean,

30:09.860 --> 30:11.940
so too does literal heat.

30:11.940 --> 30:16.100
Greece, particularly vulnerable to climate change generally, and especially heat waves,

30:16.100 --> 30:19.180
has decided to begin to name the extreme bouts of heat.

30:19.180 --> 30:23.260
Categorizing heat waves is tricky, but any standardization will allow the country to

30:23.260 --> 30:27.700
better systematically respond to temperature upticks and communicate the danger.

30:27.700 --> 30:32.660
2021 marked the end of the Free Latifa campaign, as the movement hatched three years ago finally

30:32.660 --> 30:34.780
saw its vision come to fruition.

30:34.780 --> 30:39.140
Princess Latifa was captured by her father, Dubai's Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum,

30:39.140 --> 30:43.020
while trying to express a little self-determination and leave the United Arab Emirates.

30:43.020 --> 30:46.780
She had hardly been seen in the past three years, but it seems her confinement came to

30:46.780 --> 30:51.160
an abrupt end as an Instagram photo showed the princess traveling in Iceland, and a verifiable

30:51.160 --> 30:55.280
statement quoted her saying she could now, quote, travel where I want.

30:55.280 --> 30:59.440
Italian motorcyclists and golfers can now, within reason, travel where they want to,

30:59.440 --> 31:00.760
and do so in style.

31:00.760 --> 31:04.780
The historic Italian car company, ESO, is relaunching with a young backer from the famed

31:04.780 --> 31:06.160
lineage leading the way.

31:06.160 --> 31:09.960
Catching the company up with the present and charging it into the future, Ferruccio Lamborghini

31:09.960 --> 31:14.840
and team are launching a motorcycle and golf cart that are modern, stylish, and sustainable.

31:14.840 --> 31:17.400
Both vehicles are completely electric.

31:17.440 --> 31:21.760
A scarecrow of the seas may help to save lives of thousands of seabirds each year, thanks

31:21.760 --> 31:25.660
to researchers in Estonia who help develop a buoy with googly eyes.

31:25.660 --> 31:29.780
The device floats above small-scale fishing operation gillnets, which can be lethal to

31:29.780 --> 31:32.600
diving seabirds, and deters them from coming near.

31:32.600 --> 31:36.840
In fact, scientists found it reduced the congregating birds by about a quarter, who are turned off

31:36.840 --> 31:40.200
by eye contact and erratic buoy behavior.

31:40.200 --> 31:43.920
Another sort of deterrent is the addition of Malta to an international gray list kept

31:43.920 --> 31:48.400
by Financial Action Task Force—a watchdog organization meant to monitor money laundering

31:48.400 --> 31:49.880
and terrorism funding.

31:49.880 --> 31:53.720
In recent years, the island nation's low tax rate for foreign companies has attracted

31:53.720 --> 31:57.440
substantial banking and investment, but that also makes it ripe for abuse.

31:57.440 --> 32:00.840
It's the first European Union nation to be listed, and could potentially affect the

32:00.840 --> 32:05.360
upward trajectory of Malta as wealthy investors look to alternate locations, given its now

32:05.360 --> 32:06.360
tenuous nature.

32:06.360 --> 32:10.920
One of Europe's wealthiest people, and the Czech Republic's richest man, Peter Kellner,

32:10.920 --> 32:15.140
was tragically killed in a helicopter crash while heli-skiing in Alaska, along with four

32:15.140 --> 32:16.760
additional passengers.

32:16.760 --> 32:22.280
Kellner was estimated to be worth $17.5 billion, and his death follows a string of recent fatal

32:22.280 --> 32:26.680
high-profile helicopter accidents, including Kobe Bryant and French billionaire Olivier

32:26.680 --> 32:27.680
Dussault.

32:27.680 --> 32:31.960
On the coast, France and the United Kingdom finally settled some post-Brexit bickering

32:31.960 --> 32:32.960
over fishing.

32:32.960 --> 32:36.200
France wanted the British government to issue a number of fishing licenses to small French

32:36.200 --> 32:40.060
boats so they could continue harvesting in British waters, and the Brits stalled, citing

32:40.060 --> 32:42.320
a number of technicalities from the French side.

32:42.320 --> 32:46.360
The issue simmered to a threat of trade sanctions level, but cooler heads prevailed, an agreement

32:46.360 --> 32:51.460
was met, and 83 fishing licenses were assigned before it reached a boiling point.

32:51.460 --> 32:55.020
Another agreement was reached in Spain, but this one pertains to many people's go-to

32:55.020 --> 32:58.140
source for the day's headlines—Google News.

32:58.140 --> 33:01.500
Banned from the country for six years because Spain required Google to pay a central fee

33:01.500 --> 33:06.060
to media organizations for use of their stories, the new law now allows Google parent company

33:06.060 --> 33:09.140
Alphabet to negotiate directly with publishers for content.

33:09.140 --> 33:14.900
Now, more than 1,000 Spanish media organizations can be sourced for news from a single smartphone.

33:14.900 --> 33:18.740
Speaking of smartphones, it may have gone unnoticed in your Apple-happy world, but South

33:18.740 --> 33:23.020
Korean manufacturer LG announced its departure from the phone market.

33:23.020 --> 33:26.780
Once ranked only behind Apple and Samsung for smartphone manufacturing, the company

33:26.780 --> 33:30.660
has had a series of bad reviews and technical rollouts, prompting it to shift its focus

33:30.660 --> 33:35.260
to other areas, such as connected devices for home, robotics, and artificial intelligence.

33:35.380 --> 33:39.700
LG joins Ericsson and HTC in the cell phone graveyard.

33:39.700 --> 33:42.820
Smart is also the way to describe Amazon's accountants.

33:42.820 --> 33:47.440
The company had a record-breaking 2020 in Europe, hauling in some $50 billion, but it

33:47.440 --> 33:51.980
managed to pay zero in corporate taxes to Luxembourg, home to its European headquarters.

33:51.980 --> 33:55.660
Of course, it's all legal, but when a company not only doesn't pay anything, but also

33:55.660 --> 34:00.260
declares losses which result in tax credits to the tune of $63 million, there was some

34:00.260 --> 34:04.900
definite eye-rolling and belt-tightening from policymakers looking to benefit from the boom.

34:05.540 --> 34:09.100
The government in Slovenia is running an alleged crusade against culture, with Prime Minister

34:09.100 --> 34:13.180
Jénez Jensa replacing the heads of several arts organizations in what some are calling

34:13.180 --> 34:15.260
a shift to more conservative approaches.

34:15.260 --> 34:19.300
Jensa, who had served twice in the role prior to being ousted for corruption, named new

34:19.300 --> 34:23.380
leaders for the National Museum, the Museum of Contemporary History, and Moderna Galleria,

34:23.380 --> 34:27.820
and he continues to terminate leases from arts organizations that rent space from the

34:27.820 --> 34:28.820
government.

34:28.820 --> 34:32.140
He denies that it's an orchestrated movement, but for many, it's hard to paint over the

34:32.140 --> 34:33.140
facts.

34:33.380 --> 34:37.820
Low government limitations have led to a hot streak of gambling development in Liechtenstein,

34:37.820 --> 34:41.060
one of the world's smallest countries, now home to five casinos.

34:41.060 --> 34:45.580
That may sound like a so-so number, but it puts it per capita above Monaco, Macau, and

34:45.580 --> 34:47.320
Las Vegas' Clark County.

34:47.320 --> 34:48.320
One reason?

34:48.320 --> 34:51.900
The gambling tax rate is lower than in neighboring countries, and the government there hasn't

34:51.900 --> 34:54.580
set caps on the number of casinos that can be built.

34:54.580 --> 34:58.080
Five more are in the pipeline, which means the foreign investors largely responsible

34:58.080 --> 35:00.800
for them are betting big on the future.

35:00.800 --> 35:04.240
Tensions are rising between Japan and the tandem of China and Russia.

35:04.240 --> 35:07.500
While they've been escalating for years because of Beijing's increased presence

35:07.500 --> 35:12.120
on islands controlled by Japan but claimed by Russia, they hit a new high when a ten-ship

35:12.120 --> 35:16.160
Chinese-Russian flotilla circumnavigated Japan's main island this summer.

35:16.160 --> 35:20.200
China and Russia say it was merely a diplomatic exercise, but Japan is worried a threatening

35:20.200 --> 35:25.080
presence mean it will need to increase defense spending and be more on guard.

35:25.080 --> 35:28.820
Spying seems to be a trend, but the United States told Israel they don't want to play

35:28.820 --> 35:30.000
that game.

35:30.000 --> 35:34.200
Daily spyware maker NSO Group was placed on an American blacklist after it was reasonably

35:34.200 --> 35:38.680
confirmed that the NSO's signature product, Pegasus, was used by foreign governments against

35:38.680 --> 35:41.600
dissidents, journalists, diplomats, and clergy members.

35:41.600 --> 35:45.560
The blacklisting means, among other things, that NSO won't be able to buy components

35:45.560 --> 35:49.500
from US companies for its products—something Apple is ensuring after suing the group this

35:49.500 --> 35:51.520
year as well.

35:51.520 --> 35:54.680
Austrian tourism officials want to encourage viewing of the country's nude sculptures

35:54.680 --> 35:58.560
and paintings that pepper museums, but social media platforms' censorship policies have

35:58.560 --> 36:00.200
made their promotion difficult.

36:00.200 --> 36:04.720
So, Vienna did what anyone trying to get around the no private parts policy would do—they

36:04.720 --> 36:08.000
opened an account on the adults-only app Onlyfans.

36:08.000 --> 36:11.240
Many of the works are critical to national cultural history, and now they're free to

36:11.240 --> 36:14.440
promote the exhibitions without that fuzzy bar.

36:14.440 --> 36:19.760
2021 wasn't all spying, censorship, and general contention—there were positive developments

36:19.760 --> 36:20.760
too.

36:20.760 --> 36:24.840
United States-based dictionary.com named allyship its word of the year.

36:24.840 --> 36:29.100
Originally added to dictionary.com in 2021, allyship rose in popularity during the Black

36:29.100 --> 36:32.720
Lives Matter movements across the world, but its definition makes clear that its applications

36:32.720 --> 36:34.540
are even farther reaching.

36:34.540 --> 36:38.660
One says, quote, the role of a person who advocates for inclusion of a marginalized

36:38.660 --> 36:42.140
or politicized group in solidarity but not as a member.

36:42.140 --> 36:45.640
More word searches means there's certainly more of this going on.

36:45.640 --> 36:49.480
This is a story about the good guy winning, but this time, it's a lobster.

36:49.480 --> 36:53.720
A Canadian grocer noticed that no one was purchasing a certain carrot-colored crustacean,

36:53.720 --> 36:57.760
but on top of that, it was being picked on by other lobsters in the tank.

36:57.760 --> 37:01.320
After several weeks, he bought the lobster himself and donated it to the Toronto Aquarium,

37:01.320 --> 37:06.080
where it was discovered his strange hue was a one in 30 million genetic mutation.

37:06.080 --> 37:11.300
Pinchy, the lobster, avoided the plate and now has a more permanent, public home.

37:11.300 --> 37:14.460
In an effort to speed up the development of more homebuilding in New Zealand, to combat

37:14.460 --> 37:18.880
the 30% increase in housing costs and shortage of inventory, officials are cutting red tape

37:18.880 --> 37:22.620
and making it easier for developers to address a housing crisis so dire that it's drawn

37:22.620 --> 37:23.860
international attention.

37:23.860 --> 37:27.980
Specifically, they're changing some density regulations, allowing for up to three homes

37:27.980 --> 37:32.260
of three stories on one site, versus one home of two stories—a move that some predict

37:32.260 --> 37:37.900
will erect 48,000 to 106,000 new homes in the next five to eight years.

37:37.900 --> 37:41.460
Expansion is something that a Belgian farmer accidentally did when he moved a several hundred

37:41.460 --> 37:43.840
pound stone seven feet into France.

37:43.840 --> 37:47.440
The historic markers delineate the borders between the two countries, and a team of Frenchmen

37:47.440 --> 37:51.820
who patrol the remote countryside verifying the positions noticed the errant stone.

37:51.820 --> 37:56.060
Luckily, the farmer wasn't charged with violating the international treaty that certifies

37:56.060 --> 38:00.140
the border—a crime that could have resulted in a territorial war instead of a slap on

38:00.140 --> 38:01.140
the wrist.

38:01.140 --> 38:05.540
To the north, the United Kingdom is rapidly trying to make up for centuries of contributing

38:05.540 --> 38:06.540
to climate change.

38:06.540 --> 38:10.740
To that end, it launched the world's most powerful tidal turbine off the port of Dundee,

38:10.740 --> 38:14.640
creating enough electricity for 2,000 homes, and Rolls-Royce announced the development

38:14.640 --> 38:19.380
of 16 smaller, cheaper nuclear power plants to electrify one million homes.

38:19.380 --> 38:23.660
Britain is already one of the largest wind energy producers in the world—not bad for

38:23.660 --> 38:26.100
the country that started the Industrial Revolution.

38:26.100 --> 38:29.160
Have you ever heard of Grab or a SPAC?

38:29.160 --> 38:31.060
In this story, we have both.

38:31.060 --> 38:35.780
Grab is a Singapore-based super app that offers everything from ride-sharing to banking in

38:35.780 --> 38:36.780
one tap.

38:36.780 --> 38:41.380
SPAC is a special purpose acquisition company—an investment strategy in which a larger company

38:41.380 --> 38:45.460
merges with a publicly traded shell company in order to exploit going public.

38:45.460 --> 38:50.220
Grab signed a $39.5 billion merger deal with a US SPAC, which brought the company public

38:50.220 --> 38:53.000
on the NASDAQ stock exchange on December 2nd.

38:53.000 --> 38:56.240
That makes it the largest ever deal of its kind, and means we should pay attention to

38:56.240 --> 38:59.060
both SPACs and Grab ASAP.

38:59.060 --> 39:03.180
Finland has a lot going for it, including being named the happiest country in the world

39:03.180 --> 39:05.020
for the fourth consecutive year.

39:05.020 --> 39:10.180
But one thing it can't nail is labor retention, and, in fact, one study shows a major reason

39:10.180 --> 39:14.740
foreign students leave Helsinki within their first year of graduating is the language barrier.

39:14.740 --> 39:17.740
These difficulties prompted the mayor to suggest transitioning the capital city to

39:17.740 --> 39:22.340
speaking English primarily—that may help employment, but TBD on happiness.

39:22.340 --> 39:26.260
We've talked a lot about ways to create green energy.

39:26.260 --> 39:29.660
Another way to fight climate change is by consuming less meat, and Denmark is leading

39:29.660 --> 39:34.340
the European Union in this effort by giving $90 million to farmers who produce plant-based

39:34.340 --> 39:36.320
foods over the next five years.

39:36.320 --> 39:40.140
The country eats a lot of pork, but the sale of plant-based foods there has increased by

39:40.140 --> 39:42.720
$8 million in two years.

39:42.720 --> 39:47.000
Things might not fly, and they might not be the only thing on the menu anymore, either.

39:47.000 --> 39:50.820
Just to the southwest, officials in the Netherlands unveiled a plan to reduce the country's

39:50.820 --> 39:55.240
livestock by one-third over the next 13 years, but it's for a different reason—there's

39:55.240 --> 39:57.040
too much poop.

39:57.040 --> 40:01.720
The country has over one million cattle, chickens, and pigs—the highest density in Europe—and

40:01.720 --> 40:05.620
can't quite contain their waste without polluting important waterways.

40:05.620 --> 40:09.080
Farmers, naturally, are pushing back, even though the multi-billion dollar plan intends

40:09.080 --> 40:11.560
to pay them to essentially exit the industry.

40:11.560 --> 40:14.720
Maybe they can jump on Denmark's plant-based paddy wagon.

40:14.720 --> 40:18.960
Also planning for the future is the 2032 Olympic Committee, and specifically, Australia.

40:18.960 --> 40:22.280
It was announced that Brisbane will be the host of the Summer Games in ten years, and

40:22.280 --> 40:26.000
what's notable about this election isn't the place, but the process.

40:26.000 --> 40:29.700
Instead of expensive, competitive, and often corrupt bidding wars pitting cities against

40:29.700 --> 40:33.840
one another, bids are now submitted and then reviewed behind closed doors by selection

40:33.840 --> 40:36.960
committees—in this case, the best mate won.

40:36.960 --> 40:42.120
In Sweden, Magdalena Anderson won but wasn't too happy with her first day on the job, so

40:42.120 --> 40:46.120
the Swedish Prime Minister resigned just 12 hours in because the Junior Green Party also

40:46.120 --> 40:48.920
quit, throwing her coalition into chaos.

40:48.920 --> 40:53.000
She indicated she'd lead a social-Democrat single-party and was re-elected a week later,

40:53.000 --> 40:56.640
becoming the first female Prime Minister of Sweden—for a second time.

40:56.640 --> 41:00.880
The second time was not as successful for a criminal in Germany, whose first crime involved

41:00.880 --> 41:02.880
a burglary in 2012.

41:02.880 --> 41:06.880
He got away with that one, and a bite of sausage, which left behind some DNA evidence that the

41:06.880 --> 41:08.240
police held onto.

41:08.240 --> 41:11.600
Fast forward to today, when he committed a more violent crime, and the genetic residue

41:11.600 --> 41:15.560
linked him to the decade-old heist through an international information sharing library.

41:15.560 --> 41:19.800
However, the statute of limitations expired, and he's gone free—proving there's no

41:19.800 --> 41:21.680
bite out of crime this time.

41:21.680 --> 41:25.560
So, we're five from the end, and the truth is a lot of headlines you missed are about

41:25.560 --> 41:30.040
the way these recent, more developed countries are adapting and attacking climate change.

41:30.040 --> 41:34.440
Iceland started operating the world's first direct air capture technology, which turned

41:34.440 --> 41:38.520
CO2 into rock, but perhaps more quirky is that the country also performed the world's

41:38.520 --> 41:42.520
first double arm and shoulder transplant to replace the limbs a man lost in a work accident

41:42.520 --> 41:44.760
more than two decades prior.

41:44.760 --> 41:48.640
Progress on the micro- and macro-level is something to high-five about.

41:48.640 --> 41:55.760
Now a quick disclaimer before this next story—the UN lists 189 HDI scores, and while a vast

41:55.760 --> 41:59.460
majority of those scores correlate to countries, the UN makes sure to acknowledge their list

41:59.460 --> 42:03.840
is a compilation of, quote, 189 countries and UN-recognized territories.

42:04.240 --> 42:08.120
We've now arrived at the only territory on their list, and while technically not a

42:08.120 --> 42:11.400
country, we figured the more news the better so we've gone ahead and included the Chinese

42:11.400 --> 42:13.360
territory of Hong Kong.

42:13.360 --> 42:17.920
Disney Plus finally launched in Hong Kong in 2021, and while much of the streaming service's

42:17.920 --> 42:21.000
content provides a needed escape from the chaos and confusion that's embroiled the

42:21.000 --> 42:24.700
Chinese territory in the past few years, one omission from the Simpsons catalog hints at

42:24.700 --> 42:27.520
just how inescapable the tension has become.

42:27.520 --> 42:32.440
Noticeably absent was episode 12 of season 16 that has the Simpson family visiting China,

42:32.440 --> 42:36.220
and specifically Tiananmen Square, and while minor for plot purposes, its disappearance

42:36.220 --> 42:39.880
signals the increasing reach of government censorship in the traditionally independent

42:39.880 --> 42:40.880
city.

42:40.880 --> 42:45.840
The Swiss are notoriously on time, but they were late to join the same-sex marriage party.

42:45.840 --> 42:50.460
The country finally approved a marriage-for-all initiative with two-thirds voting in favor,

42:50.460 --> 42:53.640
becoming one of the last Western European countries to do so.

42:53.640 --> 42:57.560
Switzerland, known for neutrality, is slow on inclusivity issues, and didn't allow

42:57.560 --> 43:02.920
women the right to vote until 1971, so this, though sluggish in adoption, is a cultural

43:02.920 --> 43:03.920
win.

43:03.920 --> 43:07.720
It also took a while for Irish authorities to come down on enforcing the European Union's

43:07.720 --> 43:12.560
three-year-old General Data Protection Regulation, which is a comprehensive data privacy law.

43:12.560 --> 43:17.740
But they served META's WhatsApp with a $270 million fine for not being transparent on

43:17.740 --> 43:21.060
how it uses people's data across the company's platforms.

43:21.060 --> 43:24.640
Many tech companies' headquarters are based in Ireland, where corporate tax rates are

43:24.640 --> 43:28.520
low, so there may be more cases like this, which of course is being contested by WhatsApp,

43:28.520 --> 43:29.720
to come.

43:29.720 --> 43:34.080
And finally, it feels appropriate to end on a note that reminds us about the scale of

43:34.080 --> 43:35.080
humanity.

43:35.080 --> 43:39.480
In Norway, a large meteor lit up the summer night sky for five to six seconds before,

43:39.480 --> 43:43.800
in all likelihood, crashing into a densely wooded area about 40 miles or 60 kilometers

43:43.800 --> 43:45.720
west of the country's capital.

43:45.720 --> 43:49.040
Some people reported a strong wind created by the pressure from it, and while it may

43:49.040 --> 43:53.680
take years to find its physical remains, the blazing meteor, for a fleeting moment, captured

43:53.720 --> 43:58.800
the attention of thousands of onlookers—a rare instance of singularity in an ever-individual

43:58.800 --> 43:59.800
world.

43:59.800 --> 44:04.920
Of course, the news doesn't stop with Norway, nor does it end with the end of the year,

44:04.920 --> 44:08.460
but you don't have to wait for us to highlight interesting stories that may have fallen through

44:08.460 --> 44:09.460
the cracks.

44:24.640 --> 44:28.480
It's certainly for me, too—look no further than my story from Portugal.

44:28.480 --> 44:32.360
All the information I needed to outline Portugal's unique work-from-home legislation was available

44:32.360 --> 44:35.340

44:35.340 --> 44:39.280

44:46.880 --> 44:48.300
impact on the economy.
