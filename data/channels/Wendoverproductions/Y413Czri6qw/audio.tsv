0	3120	Welcome to our year-end review, part two.
3120	6040	If you're tuning in for the first time, this is a special episode during which we
6040	9440	give you one headline from every country in the world from the past year.
9440	13440	The caveat is, hopefully, it's a headline you hadn't heard and has little to do with
13440	14440	the C-word.
14440	18640	We did this last year and we organized countries by population size, counting down from largest
18640	19720	to smallest.
19720	23480	This year, we are doing a count-up organized by the Human Development Index, which is a
23480	27520	number between zero and one determined by the United Nations, based on a series of metrics
27520	30160	including education, longevity, and earnings.
30160	33880	We are halfway through the list and will end with a country that has the highest HDI in
33880	34880	the world.
34880	38560	If you haven't watched part one, we suggest you do that too, where we explain the HDI
38560	39560	breakdown in detail.
39560	43160	If you're joining for part two, thanks, because it means you like part one.
43160	45560	Without delay, here's two.
45560	49480	Distancing themselves is something that a Dutch organization is trying to do with Astrid
49480	53860	Romer, a poet from the former Dutch colony of Suriname, after it awarded her with a prestigious
53860	55880	literary prize earlier this year.
55920	59720	Recently, she made controversial statements supporting murderous former president of Suriname
59720	64080	Desi Buterce, and the Dutch organizers of the award chose to forgo the ceremony honoring
64080	67160	her and simply gave her the cash prize with little fanfare.
67160	70720	Romer, like any real poet, is sticking to her words.
70720	74360	Back underground we go, this time to Petit Mustique, which is part of St. Vincent and
74360	78920	the Grenadines, where a human skull was unearthed on this remote, rugged island in 2003.
78920	84120	And this year, researchers at the University of Oregon may have uncovered why it was there—skeletal
84120	88360	abnormalities show the female likely had leprosy, and this isolated part of the Caribbean was
88360	92000	probably used to keep people with the disease away from the public—something that many
92000	94760	have speculated, but this finding actually supports.
94760	99760	The skull dates back 200 years, and is possibly the earliest case of leprosy recorded in the
99760	100760	Americas.
100760	104160	There is also some speculation that Tunisian president Kayis Said's appointment of a
104160	107760	female prime minister may have been a way to calm critics who say he's overreaching
107760	111080	his power in the Arab Spring's only remaining democracy.
111080	115520	Before Najla Boudin-Ramadanhay's appointment, Said had already suspended Parliament, seized
115520	118800	power, and fired the previous prime minister, and because Ramadanhay doesn't have a lot
118800	122580	of political experience, her trajectory could be challenging—but she is already making
122580	126160	history as the first female prime minister in the Arab world.
126160	130240	The Maldives have the unenvious position of exemplifying climate change's already dire
130240	134300	effects on low-lying nations, where 30% of the country's annual government budget is
134300	136760	being spent on adapting to climate change.
136760	140600	Developed nations have agreed to spend $100 billion to help vulnerable countries adapt,
141120	144040	but Maldives' speaker of parliament wants more—he's asking that rich nations also
144040	147820	pay reparations to help the others deal with the consequences they're already suffering,
147820	149840	and likely didn't cause.
149840	153800	Islands in the Caribbean continue to bet big on tourism, especially countries like Dominica,
153800	157600	which offers citizenship by investment through properties like the six-star resort of Secret
157600	158600	Bay.
158600	162160	For the fifth year in a row, Dominica was named the best country for second citizenship
162160	164200	by Professional Wealth Management magazine.
164200	167840	The second home citizens have primarily come from Africa, but with a new non-stop flight
167840	171640	from Miami running, that could potentially change with Americans starting to look south
171640	173880	for another home and passport.
173880	178120	Added bonus, Dominican residents now get visa-free access to China.
178120	182360	When we say coral reef, you probably say, ugh, that's because a lot of news about
182360	186320	the ocean's critical habitat for fish species is generally bad, and that could have been
186320	191080	the expectation after tropical cyclone Winston caused more than $1.4 billion in damage to
191080	196040	Fiji in 2016 and pummeled the island's reefs, but they've bounced back in a big way as
196040	199960	young coral colonies have taken off, much to the delight of researchers, residents,
199960	202920	and likely the colorful fish that have found a new home.
202920	206920	Also in repair are more than a handful of the 130 precious historical artifacts that
206920	210000	were destroyed in the harbor blast in Lebanon that killed 200 people.
210000	213880	While the objects pale in comparison to human lives, their historical significance remains
213880	218760	important, and that's why the British Museum granted $29,500 in restoration funds to help
218760	223360	repair some of the more critical glass vessels, which are nearly 2,000 years old.
223360	227840	Here on the northwest tip of Africa, an ongoing conflict between Algeria and Morocco might
227840	229280	leave Spain in the cold.
229280	233600	Spain gets about half of its gas from Algeria, which pumps it through a pipeline in Morocco.
233600	237640	Morocco depends on Algeria for about 10% of its gas, and Algeria suspended this pipeline
237640	241600	to both countries to upset Morocco in an ongoing territorial dispute.
241600	245080	It turns out, this may affect Spaniards the most, and we'll still be able to get gas
245080	248440	through alternate routes, but at much higher prices.
248440	250560	Moldova is running out of gas too.
250560	254320	At the end of its contract with Gazprom, Moldova declared a state of emergency when
254320	258040	the Russian energy company raised its gas prices and slashed supply.
258040	262100	Accused of using gas as leverage, allegations have surfaced that contract renegotiations
262100	266120	involve discussion of political issues regarding Moldova's separatist region of Transnistria
266120	268520	and its connection to the EU.
268520	272200	Associated with the EU but reliant on Russian resources, Moldova frequently finds itself
272200	276040	in the unenviable position of sitting between east and west.
276040	280520	From unenviable to regrettable, a mafia fugitive did himself in by appearing on a YouTube cooking
280520	283200	show in his adopted home of the Dominican Republic.
283200	287120	Though he never showed his face while flashing his Italian culinary chops, Mark-friend Claude
287120	289440	Biart's tattoos gave him away to the police.
289440	293020	A member of Italy's largest mafia, who fled Europe when accused of trafficking cocaine
293020	298000	into the Netherlands, Biart led a quiet, unassuming, and, in hindsight, too comfortable life in
298000	299360	the city of Boca Chica.
299360	304220	An apocalyptic scene unfolded just off the coast of Azerbaijan as a column of fire blasted
304220	305520	out of the Caspian Sea.
305520	309620	While the Caspian is dotted by various offshore oil rigs, the assumed culprit for the flare-up
309620	313580	wasn't a leaky Soviet-era pipeline, but one of the region's infamous mud volcanoes
313580	314780	sparking the blast.
314780	318940	Dubbed the Land of Fire, Azerbaijan is home to major oil reserves and hundreds of these
318940	322040	mud volcanoes—many of which are active today.
322040	325540	What happens underground is also of interest in Saint Lucia, where the Caribbean nation
325540	328780	is taking the first steps towards harnessing geothermal energy.
328780	332960	Currently, Saint Lucia relies primarily on diesel generators for power, so any alternative
332960	337320	that would alleviate high energy costs is welcomed, especially one as green as geothermal.
337320	341280	The next step is figuring out viability—a project that will be greatly aided by a $22
341280	345520	million grant made by the World Bank to explore the potential of the energy source.
345520	349920	In Ecuador's most famous islands, Darwin's arch died of natural causes.
349920	354240	Just a kilometer or 0.6 miles off the coast of Darwin Island in the Galapagos, the arch
354240	357840	was a popular destination for divers and photographers.
357840	361160	Ecuadorian officials said that the bridge was brought down by natural erosion.
361160	364840	Year by year, though, erosion is becoming more of a threat and less natural, as volatile
364840	368880	weather and warming waters are intensifying the process that created many of the earth's
368880	370800	arches in the first place.
370800	373520	Another troubling trend came to a head in China.
373520	377160	Birth rates in the world's most populous country hit an all-time low since the country
377160	379880	began tabulating the figure in 1978.
379880	384040	Infamous for its one-child policy, China has began easing restrictions on family size since
384040	387720	2015, as dropping birth rates began to worry state officials.
387720	391200	This year's low watermark, though, hints that the problem may be beyond policy and
391200	394800	expected demographic shifts as the country develops, and more so a function of rising
394800	399220	cost of living and financial insecurity pushing potential parents to hold off.
399220	402320	Birds too are adapting to changing material living conditions.
402320	407000	A study of 77 non-migratory birds undertaken in Brazil has shown that each species has
407000	410180	become smaller in stature over the past 40 years.
410180	414040	This finding, in species confined to remote areas of the Amazon, has allowed researchers
414040	418720	to conclude that the shrinking is in response to the one major alteration in their environment—temperature
418720	419720	rise.
419720	422560	While the researchers haven't come to a consensus, it's hypothesized that the birds
422560	426120	are slimming down because they simply aren't required to generate the same body heat as
426120	429280	in decades prior—humans are doing it for them.
429280	434120	A decision made by Colombia's Congress gave Vicê, often referred to as African-Columbian
434120	437300	moonshine, its well-deserved moment in the sun.
437300	441560	Recognizing the liquor distilled from sugarcane by generations of African-Columbians as a
441560	447160	piece of the country's ancestral and cultural heritage is an honor, and for many, an opportunity.
447160	451260	This notoriety, experts believe, will provide an opportunity for distillers to capitalize
451260	455600	on the product, giving it the chance to follow the same trajectory as Mezcal in Mexico and
455600	458320	to create generational wealth locally.
458320	462720	While other parts of former Yugoslavia threatened to fall apart, North Macedonia celebrated
462720	467960	2021, as the year marked the 30th anniversary of its peacefully established independence.
467960	472400	A military parade through the capital of Skopje and celebrations across the country marked
472400	473400	the occasion.
473400	477620	While independent for decades, integration into the West has been a winding road as disputes
477620	481840	with Greece saw the country relinquish its original name, Macedonia, for its current
481840	483400	moniker.
483400	487200	Another milestone was reached this year when Joe Biden became the first US President to
487200	490960	acknowledge that the Armenian Genocide was, in fact, a genocide.
490960	495320	In Armenia, and across the Armenian diaspora, the news was welcomed with a tepid response
495320	499160	not because of the 106 years of separation from the event, but because the declaration
499160	501900	is, of course, merely a declaration.
501900	505580	Many see the statement as a symbolic gesture designed to test the relationship with Turkey,
505580	509540	who has yet to qualify the historic atrocity as a genocide.
509540	513980	A move that may have large repercussions caught the eye of free speech advocates worldwide
513980	518600	when Thailand's government banned the dissemination of news that quote, causes public fear.
518600	522540	The government framed the mandate as a move to limit the dangerous spread of disinformation,
522540	524260	but critics see it differently.
524260	527940	The ban, which allows the government to block individuals' internet access, conveniently
527940	533220	materialized just as criticism with the government's slow rollout of vaccines hit fever pitch.
533220	537820	For Peru's conservative right, there's been no escaping fear-inducing news in 2021,
537820	542300	as a narrow election saw the swearing in of Socialist President Pedro Castillo.
542300	546660	The rise of the rural teacher-turned-politician caught the world off guard and certainly didn't
546660	549960	sit right with the country's established power brokers, who immediately contested the
549960	553060	result and whose supporters harassed election officials.
553060	557300	Only months in, Castillo's presidency is barely holding on as his approval rating has
557340	561180	plummeted, and a possible move to impeach hangs in the balance.
561180	565320	A world record also hung in the balance this year, as spectators along an Antiguan harbor
565320	569320	anxiously awaited the appearance of Jasmine Harrison's rowboat on the horizon.
569320	572900	She and her boat eventually pulled into the waters of Antigua and Barbuda, the nation
572900	576740	that marks the finish line of the Talisker Whiskey Atlantic Challenge, and Harrison became
576740	581700	the youngest woman to row the Atlantic solo—a 70-day long odyssey that saw her thrown overboard
581700	584620	twice, and her medal tested constantly.
584620	587840	Moving to the end of their own odyssey is the Scythian gold.
587840	591560	This year, a Dutch court ruled that the trove of Crimean treasures dating back to the days
591560	594520	of the Silk Road rightfully belonged to Ukraine.
594520	598780	On display in 2014, when Russia annexed the peninsula, the fate of these cultural artifacts
598780	601780	has been in limbo for years before this ruling.
601780	605620	Russia has criticized the ruling, while Ukraine has labeled this another recognition of the
605620	608700	world's condemnation over Russia's seizure of the peninsula.
608700	611580	In Saint Kitts and Nevis, the story's apiculture.
611580	616220	Now, if you aren't a former G.O.B. champion with an expansive vocabulary, you may not
616220	618840	recognize the place nor the practice.
618840	623220	All the same, the Crimean nation of 50,000 joined an international effort to help launch
623220	625940	and support local beekeeping businesses.
625940	629500	If properly executed, the initiative will create additional jobs, bring local honey
629500	634220	and wax products to market, and help protect biodiversity by keeping pollinators, well,
634220	635220	buzzing.
635220	640260	West of where a bulk of bees is set to soon buzz, Mexican politicians and activists battled.
640260	644380	After much debate, it was announced that Mexico's 150-year-old Columbus statue was
644380	647140	to be replaced by a statue of an indigenous woman.
647140	651140	A reasonable decision at surface level, and one that recognizes two oft-overlooked groups
651140	655500	in Mexico, women, and indigenous people, some see the move as political posturing by Mayor
655500	659620	Claudia Chabon, one that wins her positive PR without actually helping the plight of
659620	662300	indigenous Mexicans or women.
662300	666260	From statues in metaphorical hot water to those physically under it, Granada announced
666260	669820	the completion of a renovation to its underwater sculpture park.
670380	673100	The repairs and cleaning of already existing sculptures were part of the project, but the
673100	678200	most exciting bit was the new 82-piece installation celebrating Grenadian culture.
678200	682600	Since its creation in 2006, the park has offered habitat for marine wildlife and served as
682600	687460	an important tourist draw—the renovation aims to maintain that positive momentum.
687460	691380	Though hard to imagine, things are getting more complicated in a country with two names
691380	692820	and three presidents.
692820	697580	Calling it a quote, existential threat, one top American diplomat flew to Bosnia-Herzegovina
697580	701980	to coax Bosnian Serb leader Milorad Dodik to lighten his separatist rhetoric that, if
701980	705980	acted on, would potentially nosedive the nation and destabilize the region.
705980	710580	The epicenter of ethnic violence in the mid-1990s that took painstaking negotiations to quell,
710580	715060	a separatist move like the one Dodik threatens would set the region back decades.
715060	719860	If nothing else good came of it, the pandemic offered zoo animals a well-earned rest.
719860	724500	In Sri Lanka, where zoos closed in March of 2020 and have only briefly opened since, animals
724500	728540	have taken the newfound peace and quiet to deeper relationships and spend a lot of time
728540	729540	in bed.
729540	733940	The result was a baby boom, as some species—the black swan and white peacock—made it in
733940	738260	Sri Lankan zoos for the first time ever, while others such as lions have accelerated their
738260	741620	output in lieu of nosy onlookers.
741620	745700	Perhaps the world could have used a few more nosy onlookers in the Seal of Oman this year,
745700	749960	as noted not-friends Iran and the US offered wildly different accounts as to what really
749960	753700	happened when Iran seized an oil tanker just off its coast.
753700	757100	Cuban officials claim that the US had taken their tanker before their successful naval
757100	761380	assault reclaimed the ship, while the US officials say that it was a Vietnamese tanker that Iran
761380	762500	had seized.
762500	766640	Regardless of who's telling the truth, this most recent rift offers a reminder of just
766640	770500	how rocky the relationships between the two nations remain.
770500	772780	Cuban officials wouldn't be fooled twice this year.
772780	776660	After the largest protests in 30 years caught them off guard in July, the government made
776660	780000	sure to stamp out the next protest before it even started.
780000	784600	As news spread of a potential pro-democracy, freedom of expression demonstration, the state
784600	788080	didn't let noted protestors leave their homes, arrested congregators, and released
788080	792760	media claiming that protests were an attempt of regime change by the hands of the US.
792760	796960	One European country has proved especially welcome to Afghan refugees, and it's one
796960	798680	of the continent's poorest.
798680	802960	Albania, bolstered by a country familiar with and receptive to immigrants, pledged to take
802960	805720	in as many as 4,000 Afghans.
805720	810360	The nearly 700 that made it to the coastal nation were put up in beachside resorts.
810360	814600	Albania is likely just a year-long stop for refugees as they seek to secure visas to countries
814600	817960	that offer more opportunity, but Albania has made it clear that they're more than welcome
817960	820240	to stay should they want to.
820240	824280	Michael B. Jordan understands first-hand the baggage that comes with a name.
824280	828120	Perhaps that's why the actor was willing to change the name of his new rum brand, initially
828120	832480	called Juvert, once Trinidad and Tobagoans took offense to his trademarking the term
832480	835280	that refers to the opening of their famed Carnaval.
835280	839280	Labeling the act as cultural appropriation, thousands from Trinidad and Tobago signed
839280	843840	an online petition to protect and respect a word that means so much to their culture.
843840	847440	The coca de mer, a palm tree that produces the world's largest and, subjectively the
847440	850920	most inappropriate seed in the world, only exists in Seychelles.
850920	855700	In fact, the tree only grows on two of the archipelago's 115 islands while the rare
855700	860640	seed, sold mostly to bemused tourists, fetches up to $260.
860640	864800	Beloved by islanders, heavily regulated by the government, and yet still endangered,
865320	868880	Seychelles is taking a new approach to conserving the tree by putting seeds in the hands of
868880	869880	locals.
869880	873060	Those interested in growing the tree on their property can apply for the honor and must
873060	877280	prove they have enough room and the right soil for the palm to take off.
877280	881500	Sending mail to the Chagos Archipelago became a bit more difficult this year.
881500	884960	Recognizing Mauritius' sovereignty over the chain of islands that's now one of Britain's
884960	889180	last and most controversial colonial holdings, the UN's postal union decided it would no
889180	893360	longer recognize postage stamps issued by the British Indian Overseas Territory of the
893360	894360	UK.
894920	897940	This move adds ever so slightly to the pressure on Britain to leave the chain and represents
897940	902040	another baby step towards returning home for Chagossians forcibly relocated to Mauritius
902040	903600	decades ago.
903600	907440	Cristiano Ronaldo couldn't wait to get home after a controversial call in Serbia cost
907440	910840	him and his country important World Cup qualifying points.
910840	915240	However, throwing his captain's armband down in disgust as he exited the pitch unintentionally
915240	920680	did a world of good for a six-month-old Serbian boy with spinal muscular atrophy.
920680	924520	Added to a charity group who then auctioned off the armband, Ronaldo's frustration resulted
924520	930720	in a $71,000 haul—money which went directly to the six-month-old's treatment.
930720	934380	In Kuwait, things aren't looking quite as dire for those nearing the other end of the
934380	938600	age spectrum as the country's legislator reversed a ban on employing expatriates over
938600	940160	the age of 60.
940160	944040	Struck down because it had no legal basis, the ruling serves as just a respite for the
944040	948080	nation's expat population, who have been leaving by the thousands as the state continues
948080	952280	to push for the development of its domestic workforce through its years-long Kuwaitization
952280	953280	project.
953280	957200	A more substantial legal ruling was recorded this year in Malaysia, as the country's
957200	962080	highest court ruled that the Islamic provision that banned same-sex acts was unconstitutional.
962080	967160	LGBTQ advocates have called the ruling historic, as the country experienced an uptick in homophobic
967160	969120	sentiment in recent years.
969120	973640	This ruling, though, does not legalize same-sex acts, as a civil law from Britain's colonial
973640	976680	era banning those is still on the books.
976680	980840	Costa Rica earned some well-deserved national attention, but the country was named one of
980840	985280	the five winners of the Earthshot Prize—a global sustainability effort spearheaded by
985280	987800	Prince William and Kate Middleton.
987800	992540	Financed largely by taxes on fossil fuels, Costa Rica has handed more than $500 million
992540	996740	to landowners over the past 20 years to protect forests and watersheds.
996740	1000120	The effort has largely reversed deforestation in the country.
1000120	1004460	While the prize money is nice, the international recognition serves as a proof of concept for
1004460	1009000	other nations, and a pat on the back for forward-thinking Costa Rica.
1009000	1011940	Forward-thinking was the praise Georgia thought it might reap when the country broke ground
1011940	1015580	on its, quote, hyper-modern Parliament building a decade ago.
1015580	1020220	Today, though, it sits empty, and its glass windows meant to signal government transparency
1020220	1021640	gather dust.
1021640	1025180	Done in by its distance from the capital and the new political regime's distaste for
1025180	1029740	it, the building was abandoned in 2018, then put up for sale through May of 2021, when
1029740	1032940	the government finally gave up on finding a buyer.
1032940	1037660	As Georgia gave up on its governmental greenhouse, Oman announced their aim to build a massive
1037660	1039340	green hydrogen plant.
1039340	1043420	Oman's following the forward-thinking theme by working to smooth an impending economic
1043420	1048700	transition as 85% of the country's GDP is generated from oil and gas—resources which
1048700	1050740	the country is quickly running out of.
1050740	1054620	Powered by wind and solar, it's hoped that the $30 billion project will be producing
1054620	1057980	and exporting renewable energy at full capacity by 2038.
1057980	1062140	In the very same year that Barbados ended symbolic ties with the Queen of England and
1062140	1067340	became a republic, the nation's most famous export, Rihanna, became a national hero.
1067340	1071540	Well, technically the artist, entrepreneur, and proud Bajan has been a national icon in
1071540	1075540	the country for more than a decade, but this year her legendary status became official
1075540	1079300	when the new republic's prime minister designated her a national hero.
1079300	1083340	Already an ambassador for the Caribbean country, and recently named the world's richest female
1083340	1087520	musician, it seems that Rihanna's reign just won't let up, and Barbados is all the
1087520	1089140	better for it.
1089140	1094140	At the other end of the Caribbean, three Cubans survived 33 days on a barren Bahamian island
1094140	1096540	before being rescued by the US Coast Guard.
1096540	1100660	After capsizing at sea, likely in an attempt to flee Cuba, the three washed up on one of
1100660	1105720	the least hospitable Bahamas, surviving on coconut water, conch shells, and rats.
1105720	1109480	After receiving brief medical attention in Florida, the resourceful survivors were handed
1109480	1112420	over to US Immigration and Customs Enforcement.
1112420	1115500	This isn't the first time the Bahamas have found itself as the meeting point between
1115500	1119980	Cuban defectors and the US, as a similar rescue took place a few islands over, not months
1119980	1121340	before this one.
1121340	1125180	The Bahamas have hardly been the focal point for dangerous American migrations, though.
1125180	1130180	It's been a record-breaking year for Panama immigration officials as a whopping 70,000
1130180	1134040	migrants from around the world have passed through the Darien Gap and into the country.
1134040	1138660	Such incredible numbers making their way through the undeveloped, densely forested, and crime-riddled
1138660	1143120	route with no formal roadways has pushed Panamanian and Colombian officials to begin regulating
1143120	1148000	the number of entrants into the Darien Gap—potentially a first step in making the journey safer for
1148000	1150280	the desperate migrants.
1150280	1153600	International collaboration was the context that informed an embarrassing development
1153600	1154840	in Bulgaria.
1154840	1159920	Led by the US Army, the NATO military exercise called Swift Response brought together 7,000
1159920	1163280	paratroopers from ten member nations for some joint practice.
1163280	1167480	Swift Response, though, quickly became seriously regrettable when American soldiers accidentally
1167480	1172400	left the training zone and barged into and cleared out a Bulgarian sunflower oil factory.
1172400	1176640	The factory has since filed a lawsuit while the US Embassy, for its part, has apologized
1176640	1178400	for the mistake.
1178400	1182160	Netflix further expanded its reach when it greenlit the company's first feature-length
1182160	1184020	film shot in Uruguay.
1184020	1188200	The company's VP of Latin American Content has hailed the project as an exciting opportunity
1188200	1190280	to highlight the creative talent in the country.
1190280	1194400	While it's unlikely that viewers will recognize names when the credits roll, the film, named
1194400	1198680	Togo, will fit right in in the current cinematic canon as the crime revolves around street-level
1198680	1201440	drug trafficking and organized crime.
1201480	1205640	Following the appearance of mysterious metallic monoliths across the American West and in
1205640	1209920	Romania, a similar structure appeared in southwest Turkey, but this one came with a message in
1209920	1214120	ancient Turkish—quote, look at the sky and you will see the moon.
1214120	1217480	Residents didn't have to wait long on an explanation as to the origins of the structure
1217480	1221440	and its innocuous truism, though, as only days after its discovery, President Erdogan
1221440	1225080	used the monolith as a background when he announced the country's new space program
1225080	1230000	and ten-year vision, proving the monolith's function as an eye-rolling gimmick.
1230040	1233800	By overlooking tradition at the Tokyo Olympics, one sprinter, rather than running for her
1233800	1236040	country, ran away from it.
1236040	1239440	Accusing her coaches of negligence before being pulled from her event and pressured
1239440	1244040	to return home to Belarus, Kristina Sayu-Muskaja fled to the Polish embassy where she was granted
1244040	1245660	a humanitarian visa.
1245660	1250240	The incident exemplifies the mounting pressure on Belarusian public figures under the country's
1250240	1254280	increasingly authoritarian government as she joins a growing list of athletes, coaches,
1254280	1258520	and high-profile Belarusians that have faced job loss, arrest, or imprisonment when voicing
1258520	1261800	discontent with the government in the past two years.
1261800	1265620	State overreach is also the fear in Russia, as the Moscow Metro has implemented a new
1265620	1269260	method of payment at over 240 stations called FacePay.
1269260	1273600	As the program's name suggests, Moscow commuters can now leave their phone and wallet at home
1273600	1275800	and simply smile for the camera to board the train.
1275800	1279560	In a country where governmental transparency is hard to come by and facial recognition
1279560	1283880	has been allegedly used to identify protestors, FacePay has human rights groups and dubious
1283880	1287780	citizens concerned by the project's potential ulterior motives.
1287780	1291500	In another former Soviet state, government officials made a statement as to where their
1291500	1296220	current allegiances lie when they kicked out an outspoken US-Russian dual national.
1296220	1300260	Receiving a letter notifying he was barred from entry into Kazakhstan, Gene Bunnan, who
1300260	1304460	founded a victim's database to track the incarceration of Uyghurs in western China,
1304460	1308680	serves as an example as to how closely Kazakhstan has come to align itself with China, not only
1308680	1313260	turning a blind eye to what the US and UN have come to define as genocide, but now seemingly
1313260	1316860	helping to quiet dissent within its own borders.
1316940	1320560	While some bonds are strengthening in Central Asia, others in the Pacific are beginning
1320560	1321700	to crumble.
1321700	1326060	The result of a vote on the new Secretary-General for the Pacific Islands Forum was the last
1326060	1329740	straw for the tiny Micronesian country of Palau, who announced they'd be leaving the
1329740	1330740	organization.
1330740	1334740	The coalition long had an informal tradition of rotating its Secretary-General position
1334740	1339640	between Micronesian, Polynesian, and Melanesian politicians, but the election of a Cook Islands
1339640	1343720	politician was a break from convention that left Micronesian nations like Palau and other
1343720	1347240	small island states that would follow their lead, feeling slighted and voiceless in the
1347240	1349400	organization's proceedings.
1349400	1353140	Trophy hunting of large carnivores is banned in Romania, but that didn't stop Prince
1353140	1357520	Emmanuel von Unzerlichtenstein of Austria from shooting the country's, and potentially
1357520	1360160	the European Union's, single largest brown bear.
1360160	1363880	While the Prince had authorization from the Romanian government to hunt a female nuisance
1363880	1368640	bear causing problems for a small farm town, he managed to bag the massive 17-year-old
1368640	1373000	Arthur, whether by accident or intentionally, is under investigation.
1373000	1377060	In another mountainous Eastern European country, construction crews put the finishing touches
1377060	1380500	on a state-of-the-art highway that cuts through rugged Montenegro.
1380500	1384140	Rather than celebrating, though, residents are beginning to ask questions about the road's
1384140	1385500	one billion dollar price tag.
1385500	1389880	The road only connects a few small communities, including the town at its terminus, Matasevo,
1389880	1391980	home to a population of 15.
1391980	1396700	An early Belt and Road project built by Chinese crews, Montenegro's finances are now seriously
1396700	1400560	strained by the road that really doesn't serve much of a purpose.
1400560	1404720	The people of Brunei are hoping for more sage decision-making from the new CEO of the
1404720	1409240	nation's largest financial institution, Bank Islam Brunei Dar Es Salaam.
1409240	1413940	Hij Nouriani will be the first female CEO of the bank that manages $10 billion of assets
1413940	1418060	and has expanded across Southeast Asia and into the Middle East in recent years.
1418060	1422700	After naming three women to top positions in 2019, the move follows an empowering trend
1422700	1425660	at the bank in the traditionally conservative country.
1425660	1430540	In Argentina, a 30-year-old confirmed an age-old maxim—if it's too good to be true, then
1430540	1432320	true, it usually is.
1432320	1436260	Searching for an explanation for a momentary Google outage, Nicolas Corona found that the
1436260	1442400	domain google.com.ar had expired, and that he could buy it for a modest $2.60.
1442400	1446380	The Argentine quickly scooped up the domain that, if everything broke his way, could be
1446380	1448200	worth millions.
1448200	1451920	The domain didn't prove a golden ticket, though, but a mistake as Google's ownership
1451920	1457440	hadn't lapsed, but in the end, Corona came out of the situation a few dollars lighter.
1457460	1460300	And a country that's been in the headlines for all the wrong reasons in the past few
1460300	1463000	years has emerged a more positive story.
1463000	1467440	Rolls-Royce and Qatar announced a multi-year, multi-billion dollar partnership aimed to
1467440	1469600	foster green technology companies.
1469600	1473880	The partnership will build two campuses, one in each country, create an estimated 1,000
1473880	1477920	jobs, and hopefully provide the resources and facilities for sustainability-oriented
1477920	1480200	startups to take off.
1480200	1485180	Prosecc and Prosecco are two different types of wine with two different names.
1485180	1489860	Almost how different the names are, though, has Croatia and Italy at loggerheads.
1489860	1493200	Croatia has sought to trademark the name of their Prosecc with the European Commission
1493200	1497540	under the assumption that consumers would be able to differentiate it from Italian Prosecco.
1497540	1501460	Italian wine aficionados think differently, and are fighting the move on account of potential
1501460	1502500	confusion.
1502500	1506720	Italians also see the effort as an attack on Italian products more broadly, as Prosecco
1506720	1513100	is a denomination of controlled origin—a wine that only comes from a specific region.
1513100	1518180	The world's largest mammal, the blue whale, only feeds in a few specific regions—one
1518180	1520780	of which is off the coast of Chilean Patagonia.
1520780	1524820	Unfortunately for the endangered species, the water is also teeming with fishing vessels
1524820	1529000	working the busy salmon farming industry, with up to 1,000 boats a day passing through
1529000	1530300	the feeding grounds.
1530300	1534500	This traffic has led to a handful of fatal collisions between boat and blue whale.
1534500	1538420	With the regional population estimated to be only in the hundreds, conservationists
1538420	1542820	are scrambling to figure out a compromise that gives the whales a bit more room.
1542860	1547300	Bahrain is keen on finding a bit more room, too—so keen, in fact, that the archipelago
1547300	1551140	nation announced plans to expand its landmass by 60%.
1551140	1555020	The island-building initiative will enlarge Bahrain's footprint, construct five new
1555020	1559260	cities, and, the government hopes, attract billions in foreign investment.
1559260	1564340	The project is set to build out tourist attractions, a sports city, and a commercial zone.
1564340	1569380	From sports cities to sports washing, it was a big year for professional athletics in Saudi
1569380	1570380	Arabia.
1570380	1574600	Despite its high-profile, highly controversial takeover of Newcastle United, the country
1574600	1578320	also announced a partnership between Gulf Saudi and the Asian tour that'll keep a
1578320	1582740	Saudi stomp on Asia's preeminent Gulf circuit and provide prize funding for a decade to
1582740	1583740	come.
1583740	1587540	While a quieter development than the Newcastle deal, many denounced the move as another attempt
1587540	1591820	to move conversation and attention away from the country's human rights record with glitz
1591820	1593280	and games.
1593280	1597660	Issues with human rights records will be impossible to miss if the Chinese Fudan University is
1597660	1600980	to follow through with building a campus in Budapest, Hungary.
1600980	1604260	Many of the city's population oppose the project, and the city's mayor has called
1604260	1607660	it an instance of, quote, Chinese influence buying.
1607660	1611540	Residents are becoming increasingly creative in their pushback, recently renaming nearby
1611540	1615360	streets Uyghur Martyrs, Dalai Lama, and Free Hong Kong Road.
1615360	1619700	One car skipped the streets entirely on its way from the Nitra Airport in Slovakia to
1619700	1624580	that in Bratislava—instead, the prototype flew the 35-minute route.
1624580	1629620	For Klein Vision's aircar, it was the 142nd landing, but an important first too as the
1629620	1633460	car successfully transitioned into normal car mode in just minutes.
1633460	1637160	While behind on the timeline that science fiction authors envisioned, flying cars are
1637160	1641260	slowly coming around with Klein, Hyundai, and GM leading the way.
1641260	1645060	Portugal's parliament pushed into the future of labor when it passed progressive measures
1645060	1647460	to protect its increasingly online workforce.
1647460	1651960	In response to the shift to working from home, new laws bar employers from contacting employees
1651960	1655760	during off-hours, allow parents of children under eight to work from home without bosses'
1655760	1659820	approval, and require employers to pitch in on employees' electricity costs.
1659820	1663240	The move comes in response to the pandemic, but also as an effort to protect Portugal's
1663240	1667960	reputation as an attractive place for digital nomads to set up shop.
1667960	1672000	Finding the remains of a different sort of nomad in Latvia cast doubt on previous theories
1672000	1676720	as to the dramatic decline of Stone Age peoples across Western Europe 5,000 years ago.
1676720	1681460	DNA analysis of a hunter-gatherer showed the man died of the plague, making him the earliest
1681460	1684580	victim of what was thought to have caused the mysterious population decline.
1684580	1688860	Analysis, however, also showed that the strain he carried didn't spread easily, and caused
1688860	1691340	milder symptoms than iterations that would follow.
1691340	1696420	Now, rather than plague, scientists are looking at climate change as a catalyst.
1696420	1699740	Successful Spanish YouTubers are making like wealthy bankers and professional athletes
1699740	1702660	before them, and running to the hills of Andorra.
1702660	1706420	One Spanish creator called Andorra the quote, Silicon Valley of YouTube, as the country
1706420	1710460	has quickly developed into a creative meeting place, luring in the like-minded with light
1710460	1714140	taxes, relative anonymity, and less stringent lockdown policies.
1714140	1718580	The move has been a boon for Andorra's sputtering economy, and a real loss for Spain's, where
1718580	1723500	local media has gone so far as to call Spanish YouTubers relocating unpatriotic.
1723500	1728540	A sputtering economy, many feel, would be the result should Poland pivot away from coal.
1728540	1732740	Currently, 70% of the country's energy comes from the non-renewable super polluter, and
1732740	1736140	coal companies and miner unions hold serious political power.
1736140	1739660	But Poland's appetite, and the massive strip mine on its border, are running Czech wells
1739860	1742860	dry, or at least so the Czech Republic accuses.
1742860	1747340	Citing European environmental laws, the Czech Republic has sued Poland, setting off a wave
1747340	1750900	of conspiracy theories across coal country.
1750900	1753920	Conspiratorial might seem like a good way to describe Lithuania's defense ministry
1753920	1757780	calling for citizens to throw their Chinese-made cell phones away.
1757780	1761740	The request, though, comes after the nation's cybersecurity center found that the Shomi
1761740	1766940	Corp, a Chinese phone maker, have censored technology built into devices that track 449
1766940	1770820	terms, including the likes of Free Tibet and Democracy Movement.
1770820	1775860	The finding comes as relationships between China and Lithuania sour over Taiwan.
1775860	1781020	One internationally recognized state, one defiant self-identifying state, two UK military
1781020	1786240	bases, and one UN buffer zone to keep the peace hint at Cyprus' geopolitical complexity.
1786240	1790280	Things didn't get any simpler in 2021, when Turkish President Erdogan announced that in
1790280	1794420	celebration of the 47th anniversary of Turkey invading the island, the country planned to
1794420	1798200	resettle an abandoned and formerly Greek Cypriot tourist town.
1798200	1801620	Celebrating an invasion with a different sort of invasion has received poor marks from the
1801620	1804700	US, the UN, and Greek Cypriots.
1804700	1809860	While heated geopolitical relations and politicians' hot air pose a threat in the Mediterranean,
1809860	1811940	so too does literal heat.
1811940	1816100	Greece, particularly vulnerable to climate change generally, and especially heat waves,
1816100	1819180	has decided to begin to name the extreme bouts of heat.
1819180	1823260	Categorizing heat waves is tricky, but any standardization will allow the country to
1823260	1827700	better systematically respond to temperature upticks and communicate the danger.
1827700	1832660	2021 marked the end of the Free Latifa campaign, as the movement hatched three years ago finally
1832660	1834780	saw its vision come to fruition.
1834780	1839140	Princess Latifa was captured by her father, Dubai's Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum,
1839140	1843020	while trying to express a little self-determination and leave the United Arab Emirates.
1843020	1846780	She had hardly been seen in the past three years, but it seems her confinement came to
1846780	1851160	an abrupt end as an Instagram photo showed the princess traveling in Iceland, and a verifiable
1851160	1855280	statement quoted her saying she could now, quote, travel where I want.
1855280	1859440	Italian motorcyclists and golfers can now, within reason, travel where they want to,
1859440	1860760	and do so in style.
1860760	1864780	The historic Italian car company, ESO, is relaunching with a young backer from the famed
1864780	1866160	lineage leading the way.
1866160	1869960	Catching the company up with the present and charging it into the future, Ferruccio Lamborghini
1869960	1874840	and team are launching a motorcycle and golf cart that are modern, stylish, and sustainable.
1874840	1877400	Both vehicles are completely electric.
1877440	1881760	A scarecrow of the seas may help to save lives of thousands of seabirds each year, thanks
1881760	1885660	to researchers in Estonia who help develop a buoy with googly eyes.
1885660	1889780	The device floats above small-scale fishing operation gillnets, which can be lethal to
1889780	1892600	diving seabirds, and deters them from coming near.
1892600	1896840	In fact, scientists found it reduced the congregating birds by about a quarter, who are turned off
1896840	1900200	by eye contact and erratic buoy behavior.
1900200	1903920	Another sort of deterrent is the addition of Malta to an international gray list kept
1903920	1908400	by Financial Action Task Force—a watchdog organization meant to monitor money laundering
1908400	1909880	and terrorism funding.
1909880	1913720	In recent years, the island nation's low tax rate for foreign companies has attracted
1913720	1917440	substantial banking and investment, but that also makes it ripe for abuse.
1917440	1920840	It's the first European Union nation to be listed, and could potentially affect the
1920840	1925360	upward trajectory of Malta as wealthy investors look to alternate locations, given its now
1925360	1926360	tenuous nature.
1926360	1930920	One of Europe's wealthiest people, and the Czech Republic's richest man, Peter Kellner,
1930920	1935140	was tragically killed in a helicopter crash while heli-skiing in Alaska, along with four
1935140	1936760	additional passengers.
1936760	1942280	Kellner was estimated to be worth $17.5 billion, and his death follows a string of recent fatal
1942280	1946680	high-profile helicopter accidents, including Kobe Bryant and French billionaire Olivier
1946680	1947680	Dussault.
1947680	1951960	On the coast, France and the United Kingdom finally settled some post-Brexit bickering
1951960	1952960	over fishing.
1952960	1956200	France wanted the British government to issue a number of fishing licenses to small French
1956200	1960060	boats so they could continue harvesting in British waters, and the Brits stalled, citing
1960060	1962320	a number of technicalities from the French side.
1962320	1966360	The issue simmered to a threat of trade sanctions level, but cooler heads prevailed, an agreement
1966360	1971460	was met, and 83 fishing licenses were assigned before it reached a boiling point.
1971460	1975020	Another agreement was reached in Spain, but this one pertains to many people's go-to
1975020	1978140	source for the day's headlines—Google News.
1978140	1981500	Banned from the country for six years because Spain required Google to pay a central fee
1981500	1986060	to media organizations for use of their stories, the new law now allows Google parent company
1986060	1989140	Alphabet to negotiate directly with publishers for content.
1989140	1994900	Now, more than 1,000 Spanish media organizations can be sourced for news from a single smartphone.
1994900	1998740	Speaking of smartphones, it may have gone unnoticed in your Apple-happy world, but South
1998740	2003020	Korean manufacturer LG announced its departure from the phone market.
2003020	2006780	Once ranked only behind Apple and Samsung for smartphone manufacturing, the company
2006780	2010660	has had a series of bad reviews and technical rollouts, prompting it to shift its focus
2010660	2015260	to other areas, such as connected devices for home, robotics, and artificial intelligence.
2015380	2019700	LG joins Ericsson and HTC in the cell phone graveyard.
2019700	2022820	Smart is also the way to describe Amazon's accountants.
2022820	2027440	The company had a record-breaking 2020 in Europe, hauling in some $50 billion, but it
2027440	2031980	managed to pay zero in corporate taxes to Luxembourg, home to its European headquarters.
2031980	2035660	Of course, it's all legal, but when a company not only doesn't pay anything, but also
2035660	2040260	declares losses which result in tax credits to the tune of $63 million, there was some
2040260	2044900	definite eye-rolling and belt-tightening from policymakers looking to benefit from the boom.
2045540	2049100	The government in Slovenia is running an alleged crusade against culture, with Prime Minister
2049100	2053180	Jénez Jensa replacing the heads of several arts organizations in what some are calling
2053180	2055260	a shift to more conservative approaches.
2055260	2059300	Jensa, who had served twice in the role prior to being ousted for corruption, named new
2059300	2063380	leaders for the National Museum, the Museum of Contemporary History, and Moderna Galleria,
2063380	2067820	and he continues to terminate leases from arts organizations that rent space from the
2067820	2068820	government.
2068820	2072140	He denies that it's an orchestrated movement, but for many, it's hard to paint over the
2072140	2073140	facts.
2073380	2077820	Low government limitations have led to a hot streak of gambling development in Liechtenstein,
2077820	2081060	one of the world's smallest countries, now home to five casinos.
2081060	2085580	That may sound like a so-so number, but it puts it per capita above Monaco, Macau, and
2085580	2087320	Las Vegas' Clark County.
2087320	2088320	One reason?
2088320	2091900	The gambling tax rate is lower than in neighboring countries, and the government there hasn't
2091900	2094580	set caps on the number of casinos that can be built.
2094580	2098080	Five more are in the pipeline, which means the foreign investors largely responsible
2098080	2100800	for them are betting big on the future.
2100800	2104240	Tensions are rising between Japan and the tandem of China and Russia.
2104240	2107500	While they've been escalating for years because of Beijing's increased presence
2107500	2112120	on islands controlled by Japan but claimed by Russia, they hit a new high when a ten-ship
2112120	2116160	Chinese-Russian flotilla circumnavigated Japan's main island this summer.
2116160	2120200	China and Russia say it was merely a diplomatic exercise, but Japan is worried a threatening
2120200	2125080	presence mean it will need to increase defense spending and be more on guard.
2125080	2128820	Spying seems to be a trend, but the United States told Israel they don't want to play
2128820	2130000	that game.
2130000	2134200	Daily spyware maker NSO Group was placed on an American blacklist after it was reasonably
2134200	2138680	confirmed that the NSO's signature product, Pegasus, was used by foreign governments against
2138680	2141600	dissidents, journalists, diplomats, and clergy members.
2141600	2145560	The blacklisting means, among other things, that NSO won't be able to buy components
2145560	2149500	from US companies for its products—something Apple is ensuring after suing the group this
2149500	2151520	year as well.
2151520	2154680	Austrian tourism officials want to encourage viewing of the country's nude sculptures
2154680	2158560	and paintings that pepper museums, but social media platforms' censorship policies have
2158560	2160200	made their promotion difficult.
2160200	2164720	So, Vienna did what anyone trying to get around the no private parts policy would do—they
2164720	2168000	opened an account on the adults-only app Onlyfans.
2168000	2171240	Many of the works are critical to national cultural history, and now they're free to
2171240	2174440	promote the exhibitions without that fuzzy bar.
2174440	2179760	2021 wasn't all spying, censorship, and general contention—there were positive developments
2179760	2180760	too.
2180760	2184840	United States-based dictionary.com named allyship its word of the year.
2184840	2189100	Originally added to dictionary.com in 2021, allyship rose in popularity during the Black
2189100	2192720	Lives Matter movements across the world, but its definition makes clear that its applications
2192720	2194540	are even farther reaching.
2194540	2198660	One says, quote, the role of a person who advocates for inclusion of a marginalized
2198660	2202140	or politicized group in solidarity but not as a member.
2202140	2205640	More word searches means there's certainly more of this going on.
2205640	2209480	This is a story about the good guy winning, but this time, it's a lobster.
2209480	2213720	A Canadian grocer noticed that no one was purchasing a certain carrot-colored crustacean,
2213720	2217760	but on top of that, it was being picked on by other lobsters in the tank.
2217760	2221320	After several weeks, he bought the lobster himself and donated it to the Toronto Aquarium,
2221320	2226080	where it was discovered his strange hue was a one in 30 million genetic mutation.
2226080	2231300	Pinchy, the lobster, avoided the plate and now has a more permanent, public home.
2231300	2234460	In an effort to speed up the development of more homebuilding in New Zealand, to combat
2234460	2238880	the 30% increase in housing costs and shortage of inventory, officials are cutting red tape
2238880	2242620	and making it easier for developers to address a housing crisis so dire that it's drawn
2242620	2243860	international attention.
2243860	2247980	Specifically, they're changing some density regulations, allowing for up to three homes
2247980	2252260	of three stories on one site, versus one home of two stories—a move that some predict
2252260	2257900	will erect 48,000 to 106,000 new homes in the next five to eight years.
2257900	2261460	Expansion is something that a Belgian farmer accidentally did when he moved a several hundred
2261460	2263840	pound stone seven feet into France.
2263840	2267440	The historic markers delineate the borders between the two countries, and a team of Frenchmen
2267440	2271820	who patrol the remote countryside verifying the positions noticed the errant stone.
2271820	2276060	Luckily, the farmer wasn't charged with violating the international treaty that certifies
2276060	2280140	the border—a crime that could have resulted in a territorial war instead of a slap on
2280140	2281140	the wrist.
2281140	2285540	To the north, the United Kingdom is rapidly trying to make up for centuries of contributing
2285540	2286540	to climate change.
2286540	2290740	To that end, it launched the world's most powerful tidal turbine off the port of Dundee,
2290740	2294640	creating enough electricity for 2,000 homes, and Rolls-Royce announced the development
2294640	2299380	of 16 smaller, cheaper nuclear power plants to electrify one million homes.
2299380	2303660	Britain is already one of the largest wind energy producers in the world—not bad for
2303660	2306100	the country that started the Industrial Revolution.
2306100	2309160	Have you ever heard of Grab or a SPAC?
2309160	2311060	In this story, we have both.
2311060	2315780	Grab is a Singapore-based super app that offers everything from ride-sharing to banking in
2315780	2316780	one tap.
2316780	2321380	SPAC is a special purpose acquisition company—an investment strategy in which a larger company
2321380	2325460	merges with a publicly traded shell company in order to exploit going public.
2325460	2330220	Grab signed a $39.5 billion merger deal with a US SPAC, which brought the company public
2330220	2333000	on the NASDAQ stock exchange on December 2nd.
2333000	2336240	That makes it the largest ever deal of its kind, and means we should pay attention to
2336240	2339060	both SPACs and Grab ASAP.
2339060	2343180	Finland has a lot going for it, including being named the happiest country in the world
2343180	2345020	for the fourth consecutive year.
2345020	2350180	But one thing it can't nail is labor retention, and, in fact, one study shows a major reason
2350180	2354740	foreign students leave Helsinki within their first year of graduating is the language barrier.
2354740	2357740	These difficulties prompted the mayor to suggest transitioning the capital city to
2357740	2362340	speaking English primarily—that may help employment, but TBD on happiness.
2362340	2366260	We've talked a lot about ways to create green energy.
2366260	2369660	Another way to fight climate change is by consuming less meat, and Denmark is leading
2369660	2374340	the European Union in this effort by giving $90 million to farmers who produce plant-based
2374340	2376320	foods over the next five years.
2376320	2380140	The country eats a lot of pork, but the sale of plant-based foods there has increased by
2380140	2382720	$8 million in two years.
2382720	2387000	Things might not fly, and they might not be the only thing on the menu anymore, either.
2387000	2390820	Just to the southwest, officials in the Netherlands unveiled a plan to reduce the country's
2390820	2395240	livestock by one-third over the next 13 years, but it's for a different reason—there's
2395240	2397040	too much poop.
2397040	2401720	The country has over one million cattle, chickens, and pigs—the highest density in Europe—and
2401720	2405620	can't quite contain their waste without polluting important waterways.
2405620	2409080	Farmers, naturally, are pushing back, even though the multi-billion dollar plan intends
2409080	2411560	to pay them to essentially exit the industry.
2411560	2414720	Maybe they can jump on Denmark's plant-based paddy wagon.
2414720	2418960	Also planning for the future is the 2032 Olympic Committee, and specifically, Australia.
2418960	2422280	It was announced that Brisbane will be the host of the Summer Games in ten years, and
2422280	2426000	what's notable about this election isn't the place, but the process.
2426000	2429700	Instead of expensive, competitive, and often corrupt bidding wars pitting cities against
2429700	2433840	one another, bids are now submitted and then reviewed behind closed doors by selection
2433840	2436960	committees—in this case, the best mate won.
2436960	2442120	In Sweden, Magdalena Anderson won but wasn't too happy with her first day on the job, so
2442120	2446120	the Swedish Prime Minister resigned just 12 hours in because the Junior Green Party also
2446120	2448920	quit, throwing her coalition into chaos.
2448920	2453000	She indicated she'd lead a social-Democrat single-party and was re-elected a week later,
2453000	2456640	becoming the first female Prime Minister of Sweden—for a second time.
2456640	2460880	The second time was not as successful for a criminal in Germany, whose first crime involved
2460880	2462880	a burglary in 2012.
2462880	2466880	He got away with that one, and a bite of sausage, which left behind some DNA evidence that the
2466880	2468240	police held onto.
2468240	2471600	Fast forward to today, when he committed a more violent crime, and the genetic residue
2471600	2475560	linked him to the decade-old heist through an international information sharing library.
2475560	2479800	However, the statute of limitations expired, and he's gone free—proving there's no
2479800	2481680	bite out of crime this time.
2481680	2485560	So, we're five from the end, and the truth is a lot of headlines you missed are about
2485560	2490040	the way these recent, more developed countries are adapting and attacking climate change.
2490040	2494440	Iceland started operating the world's first direct air capture technology, which turned
2494440	2498520	CO2 into rock, but perhaps more quirky is that the country also performed the world's
2498520	2502520	first double arm and shoulder transplant to replace the limbs a man lost in a work accident
2502520	2504760	more than two decades prior.
2504760	2508640	Progress on the micro- and macro-level is something to high-five about.
2508640	2515760	Now a quick disclaimer before this next story—the UN lists 189 HDI scores, and while a vast
2515760	2519460	majority of those scores correlate to countries, the UN makes sure to acknowledge their list
2519460	2523840	is a compilation of, quote, 189 countries and UN-recognized territories.
2524240	2528120	We've now arrived at the only territory on their list, and while technically not a
2528120	2531400	country, we figured the more news the better so we've gone ahead and included the Chinese
2531400	2533360	territory of Hong Kong.
2533360	2537920	Disney Plus finally launched in Hong Kong in 2021, and while much of the streaming service's
2537920	2541000	content provides a needed escape from the chaos and confusion that's embroiled the
2541000	2544700	Chinese territory in the past few years, one omission from the Simpsons catalog hints at
2544700	2547520	just how inescapable the tension has become.
2547520	2552440	Noticeably absent was episode 12 of season 16 that has the Simpson family visiting China,
2552440	2556220	and specifically Tiananmen Square, and while minor for plot purposes, its disappearance
2556220	2559880	signals the increasing reach of government censorship in the traditionally independent
2559880	2560880	city.
2560880	2565840	The Swiss are notoriously on time, but they were late to join the same-sex marriage party.
2565840	2570460	The country finally approved a marriage-for-all initiative with two-thirds voting in favor,
2570460	2573640	becoming one of the last Western European countries to do so.
2573640	2577560	Switzerland, known for neutrality, is slow on inclusivity issues, and didn't allow
2577560	2582920	women the right to vote until 1971, so this, though sluggish in adoption, is a cultural
2582920	2583920	win.
2583920	2587720	It also took a while for Irish authorities to come down on enforcing the European Union's
2587720	2592560	three-year-old General Data Protection Regulation, which is a comprehensive data privacy law.
2592560	2597740	But they served META's WhatsApp with a $270 million fine for not being transparent on
2597740	2601060	how it uses people's data across the company's platforms.
2601060	2604640	Many tech companies' headquarters are based in Ireland, where corporate tax rates are
2604640	2608520	low, so there may be more cases like this, which of course is being contested by WhatsApp,
2608520	2609720	to come.
2609720	2614080	And finally, it feels appropriate to end on a note that reminds us about the scale of
2614080	2615080	humanity.
2615080	2619480	In Norway, a large meteor lit up the summer night sky for five to six seconds before,
2619480	2623800	in all likelihood, crashing into a densely wooded area about 40 miles or 60 kilometers
2623800	2625720	west of the country's capital.
2625720	2629040	Some people reported a strong wind created by the pressure from it, and while it may
2629040	2633680	take years to find its physical remains, the blazing meteor, for a fleeting moment, captured
2633720	2638800	the attention of thousands of onlookers—a rare instance of singularity in an ever-individual
2638800	2639800	world.
2639800	2644920	Of course, the news doesn't stop with Norway, nor does it end with the end of the year,
2644920	2648460	but you don't have to wait for us to highlight interesting stories that may have fallen through
2648460	2649460	the cracks.
