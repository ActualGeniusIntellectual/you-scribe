{"text": " Welcome to our year-end review, part two. If you're tuning in for the first time, this is a special episode during which we give you one headline from every country in the world from the past year. The caveat is, hopefully, it's a headline you hadn't heard and has little to do with the C-word. We did this last year and we organized countries by population size, counting down from largest to smallest. This year, we are doing a count-up organized by the Human Development Index, which is a number between zero and one determined by the United Nations, based on a series of metrics including education, longevity, and earnings. We are halfway through the list and will end with a country that has the highest HDI in the world. If you haven't watched part one, we suggest you do that too, where we explain the HDI breakdown in detail. If you're joining for part two, thanks, because it means you like part one. Without delay, here's two. Distancing themselves is something that a Dutch organization is trying to do with Astrid Romer, a poet from the former Dutch colony of Suriname, after it awarded her with a prestigious literary prize earlier this year. Recently, she made controversial statements supporting murderous former president of Suriname Desi Buterce, and the Dutch organizers of the award chose to forgo the ceremony honoring her and simply gave her the cash prize with little fanfare. Romer, like any real poet, is sticking to her words. Back underground we go, this time to Petit Mustique, which is part of St. Vincent and the Grenadines, where a human skull was unearthed on this remote, rugged island in 2003. And this year, researchers at the University of Oregon may have uncovered why it was there\u2014skeletal abnormalities show the female likely had leprosy, and this isolated part of the Caribbean was probably used to keep people with the disease away from the public\u2014something that many have speculated, but this finding actually supports. The skull dates back 200 years, and is possibly the earliest case of leprosy recorded in the Americas. There is also some speculation that Tunisian president Kayis Said's appointment of a female prime minister may have been a way to calm critics who say he's overreaching his power in the Arab Spring's only remaining democracy. Before Najla Boudin-Ramadanhay's appointment, Said had already suspended Parliament, seized power, and fired the previous prime minister, and because Ramadanhay doesn't have a lot of political experience, her trajectory could be challenging\u2014but she is already making history as the first female prime minister in the Arab world. The Maldives have the unenvious position of exemplifying climate change's already dire effects on low-lying nations, where 30% of the country's annual government budget is being spent on adapting to climate change. Developed nations have agreed to spend $100 billion to help vulnerable countries adapt, but Maldives' speaker of parliament wants more\u2014he's asking that rich nations also pay reparations to help the others deal with the consequences they're already suffering, and likely didn't cause. Islands in the Caribbean continue to bet big on tourism, especially countries like Dominica, which offers citizenship by investment through properties like the six-star resort of Secret Bay. For the fifth year in a row, Dominica was named the best country for second citizenship by Professional Wealth Management magazine. The second home citizens have primarily come from Africa, but with a new non-stop flight from Miami running, that could potentially change with Americans starting to look south for another home and passport. Added bonus, Dominican residents now get visa-free access to China. When we say coral reef, you probably say, ugh, that's because a lot of news about the ocean's critical habitat for fish species is generally bad, and that could have been the expectation after tropical cyclone Winston caused more than $1.4 billion in damage to Fiji in 2016 and pummeled the island's reefs, but they've bounced back in a big way as young coral colonies have taken off, much to the delight of researchers, residents, and likely the colorful fish that have found a new home. Also in repair are more than a handful of the 130 precious historical artifacts that were destroyed in the harbor blast in Lebanon that killed 200 people. While the objects pale in comparison to human lives, their historical significance remains important, and that's why the British Museum granted $29,500 in restoration funds to help repair some of the more critical glass vessels, which are nearly 2,000 years old. Here on the northwest tip of Africa, an ongoing conflict between Algeria and Morocco might leave Spain in the cold. Spain gets about half of its gas from Algeria, which pumps it through a pipeline in Morocco. Morocco depends on Algeria for about 10% of its gas, and Algeria suspended this pipeline to both countries to upset Morocco in an ongoing territorial dispute. It turns out, this may affect Spaniards the most, and we'll still be able to get gas through alternate routes, but at much higher prices. Moldova is running out of gas too. At the end of its contract with Gazprom, Moldova declared a state of emergency when the Russian energy company raised its gas prices and slashed supply. Accused of using gas as leverage, allegations have surfaced that contract renegotiations involve discussion of political issues regarding Moldova's separatist region of Transnistria and its connection to the EU. Associated with the EU but reliant on Russian resources, Moldova frequently finds itself in the unenviable position of sitting between east and west. From unenviable to regrettable, a mafia fugitive did himself in by appearing on a YouTube cooking show in his adopted home of the Dominican Republic. Though he never showed his face while flashing his Italian culinary chops, Mark-friend Claude Biart's tattoos gave him away to the police. A member of Italy's largest mafia, who fled Europe when accused of trafficking cocaine into the Netherlands, Biart led a quiet, unassuming, and, in hindsight, too comfortable life in the city of Boca Chica. An apocalyptic scene unfolded just off the coast of Azerbaijan as a column of fire blasted out of the Caspian Sea. While the Caspian is dotted by various offshore oil rigs, the assumed culprit for the flare-up wasn't a leaky Soviet-era pipeline, but one of the region's infamous mud volcanoes sparking the blast. Dubbed the Land of Fire, Azerbaijan is home to major oil reserves and hundreds of these mud volcanoes\u2014many of which are active today. What happens underground is also of interest in Saint Lucia, where the Caribbean nation is taking the first steps towards harnessing geothermal energy. Currently, Saint Lucia relies primarily on diesel generators for power, so any alternative that would alleviate high energy costs is welcomed, especially one as green as geothermal. The next step is figuring out viability\u2014a project that will be greatly aided by a $22 million grant made by the World Bank to explore the potential of the energy source. In Ecuador's most famous islands, Darwin's arch died of natural causes. Just a kilometer or 0.6 miles off the coast of Darwin Island in the Galapagos, the arch was a popular destination for divers and photographers. Ecuadorian officials said that the bridge was brought down by natural erosion. Year by year, though, erosion is becoming more of a threat and less natural, as volatile weather and warming waters are intensifying the process that created many of the earth's arches in the first place. Another troubling trend came to a head in China. Birth rates in the world's most populous country hit an all-time low since the country began tabulating the figure in 1978. Infamous for its one-child policy, China has began easing restrictions on family size since 2015, as dropping birth rates began to worry state officials. This year's low watermark, though, hints that the problem may be beyond policy and expected demographic shifts as the country develops, and more so a function of rising cost of living and financial insecurity pushing potential parents to hold off. Birds too are adapting to changing material living conditions. A study of 77 non-migratory birds undertaken in Brazil has shown that each species has become smaller in stature over the past 40 years. This finding, in species confined to remote areas of the Amazon, has allowed researchers to conclude that the shrinking is in response to the one major alteration in their environment\u2014temperature rise. While the researchers haven't come to a consensus, it's hypothesized that the birds are slimming down because they simply aren't required to generate the same body heat as in decades prior\u2014humans are doing it for them. A decision made by Colombia's Congress gave Vic\u00ea, often referred to as African-Columbian moonshine, its well-deserved moment in the sun. Recognizing the liquor distilled from sugarcane by generations of African-Columbians as a piece of the country's ancestral and cultural heritage is an honor, and for many, an opportunity. This notoriety, experts believe, will provide an opportunity for distillers to capitalize on the product, giving it the chance to follow the same trajectory as Mezcal in Mexico and to create generational wealth locally. While other parts of former Yugoslavia threatened to fall apart, North Macedonia celebrated 2021, as the year marked the 30th anniversary of its peacefully established independence. A military parade through the capital of Skopje and celebrations across the country marked the occasion. While independent for decades, integration into the West has been a winding road as disputes with Greece saw the country relinquish its original name, Macedonia, for its current moniker. Another milestone was reached this year when Joe Biden became the first US President to acknowledge that the Armenian Genocide was, in fact, a genocide. In Armenia, and across the Armenian diaspora, the news was welcomed with a tepid response not because of the 106 years of separation from the event, but because the declaration is, of course, merely a declaration. Many see the statement as a symbolic gesture designed to test the relationship with Turkey, who has yet to qualify the historic atrocity as a genocide. A move that may have large repercussions caught the eye of free speech advocates worldwide when Thailand's government banned the dissemination of news that quote, causes public fear. The government framed the mandate as a move to limit the dangerous spread of disinformation, but critics see it differently. The ban, which allows the government to block individuals' internet access, conveniently materialized just as criticism with the government's slow rollout of vaccines hit fever pitch. For Peru's conservative right, there's been no escaping fear-inducing news in 2021, as a narrow election saw the swearing in of Socialist President Pedro Castillo. The rise of the rural teacher-turned-politician caught the world off guard and certainly didn't sit right with the country's established power brokers, who immediately contested the result and whose supporters harassed election officials. Only months in, Castillo's presidency is barely holding on as his approval rating has plummeted, and a possible move to impeach hangs in the balance. A world record also hung in the balance this year, as spectators along an Antiguan harbor anxiously awaited the appearance of Jasmine Harrison's rowboat on the horizon. She and her boat eventually pulled into the waters of Antigua and Barbuda, the nation that marks the finish line of the Talisker Whiskey Atlantic Challenge, and Harrison became the youngest woman to row the Atlantic solo\u2014a 70-day long odyssey that saw her thrown overboard twice, and her medal tested constantly. Moving to the end of their own odyssey is the Scythian gold. This year, a Dutch court ruled that the trove of Crimean treasures dating back to the days of the Silk Road rightfully belonged to Ukraine. On display in 2014, when Russia annexed the peninsula, the fate of these cultural artifacts has been in limbo for years before this ruling. Russia has criticized the ruling, while Ukraine has labeled this another recognition of the world's condemnation over Russia's seizure of the peninsula. In Saint Kitts and Nevis, the story's apiculture. Now, if you aren't a former G.O.B. champion with an expansive vocabulary, you may not recognize the place nor the practice. All the same, the Crimean nation of 50,000 joined an international effort to help launch and support local beekeeping businesses. If properly executed, the initiative will create additional jobs, bring local honey and wax products to market, and help protect biodiversity by keeping pollinators, well, buzzing. West of where a bulk of bees is set to soon buzz, Mexican politicians and activists battled. After much debate, it was announced that Mexico's 150-year-old Columbus statue was to be replaced by a statue of an indigenous woman. A reasonable decision at surface level, and one that recognizes two oft-overlooked groups in Mexico, women, and indigenous people, some see the move as political posturing by Mayor Claudia Chabon, one that wins her positive PR without actually helping the plight of indigenous Mexicans or women. From statues in metaphorical hot water to those physically under it, Granada announced the completion of a renovation to its underwater sculpture park. The repairs and cleaning of already existing sculptures were part of the project, but the most exciting bit was the new 82-piece installation celebrating Grenadian culture. Since its creation in 2006, the park has offered habitat for marine wildlife and served as an important tourist draw\u2014the renovation aims to maintain that positive momentum. Though hard to imagine, things are getting more complicated in a country with two names and three presidents. Calling it a quote, existential threat, one top American diplomat flew to Bosnia-Herzegovina to coax Bosnian Serb leader Milorad Dodik to lighten his separatist rhetoric that, if acted on, would potentially nosedive the nation and destabilize the region. The epicenter of ethnic violence in the mid-1990s that took painstaking negotiations to quell, a separatist move like the one Dodik threatens would set the region back decades. If nothing else good came of it, the pandemic offered zoo animals a well-earned rest. In Sri Lanka, where zoos closed in March of 2020 and have only briefly opened since, animals have taken the newfound peace and quiet to deeper relationships and spend a lot of time in bed. The result was a baby boom, as some species\u2014the black swan and white peacock\u2014made it in Sri Lankan zoos for the first time ever, while others such as lions have accelerated their output in lieu of nosy onlookers. Perhaps the world could have used a few more nosy onlookers in the Seal of Oman this year, as noted not-friends Iran and the US offered wildly different accounts as to what really happened when Iran seized an oil tanker just off its coast. Cuban officials claim that the US had taken their tanker before their successful naval assault reclaimed the ship, while the US officials say that it was a Vietnamese tanker that Iran had seized. Regardless of who's telling the truth, this most recent rift offers a reminder of just how rocky the relationships between the two nations remain. Cuban officials wouldn't be fooled twice this year. After the largest protests in 30 years caught them off guard in July, the government made sure to stamp out the next protest before it even started. As news spread of a potential pro-democracy, freedom of expression demonstration, the state didn't let noted protestors leave their homes, arrested congregators, and released media claiming that protests were an attempt of regime change by the hands of the US. One European country has proved especially welcome to Afghan refugees, and it's one of the continent's poorest. Albania, bolstered by a country familiar with and receptive to immigrants, pledged to take in as many as 4,000 Afghans. The nearly 700 that made it to the coastal nation were put up in beachside resorts. Albania is likely just a year-long stop for refugees as they seek to secure visas to countries that offer more opportunity, but Albania has made it clear that they're more than welcome to stay should they want to. Michael B. Jordan understands first-hand the baggage that comes with a name. Perhaps that's why the actor was willing to change the name of his new rum brand, initially called Juvert, once Trinidad and Tobagoans took offense to his trademarking the term that refers to the opening of their famed Carnaval. Labeling the act as cultural appropriation, thousands from Trinidad and Tobago signed an online petition to protect and respect a word that means so much to their culture. The coca de mer, a palm tree that produces the world's largest and, subjectively the most inappropriate seed in the world, only exists in Seychelles. In fact, the tree only grows on two of the archipelago's 115 islands while the rare seed, sold mostly to bemused tourists, fetches up to $260. Beloved by islanders, heavily regulated by the government, and yet still endangered, Seychelles is taking a new approach to conserving the tree by putting seeds in the hands of locals. Those interested in growing the tree on their property can apply for the honor and must prove they have enough room and the right soil for the palm to take off. Sending mail to the Chagos Archipelago became a bit more difficult this year. Recognizing Mauritius' sovereignty over the chain of islands that's now one of Britain's last and most controversial colonial holdings, the UN's postal union decided it would no longer recognize postage stamps issued by the British Indian Overseas Territory of the UK. This move adds ever so slightly to the pressure on Britain to leave the chain and represents another baby step towards returning home for Chagossians forcibly relocated to Mauritius decades ago. Cristiano Ronaldo couldn't wait to get home after a controversial call in Serbia cost him and his country important World Cup qualifying points. However, throwing his captain's armband down in disgust as he exited the pitch unintentionally did a world of good for a six-month-old Serbian boy with spinal muscular atrophy. Added to a charity group who then auctioned off the armband, Ronaldo's frustration resulted in a $71,000 haul\u2014money which went directly to the six-month-old's treatment. In Kuwait, things aren't looking quite as dire for those nearing the other end of the age spectrum as the country's legislator reversed a ban on employing expatriates over the age of 60. Struck down because it had no legal basis, the ruling serves as just a respite for the nation's expat population, who have been leaving by the thousands as the state continues to push for the development of its domestic workforce through its years-long Kuwaitization project. A more substantial legal ruling was recorded this year in Malaysia, as the country's highest court ruled that the Islamic provision that banned same-sex acts was unconstitutional. LGBTQ advocates have called the ruling historic, as the country experienced an uptick in homophobic sentiment in recent years. This ruling, though, does not legalize same-sex acts, as a civil law from Britain's colonial era banning those is still on the books. Costa Rica earned some well-deserved national attention, but the country was named one of the five winners of the Earthshot Prize\u2014a global sustainability effort spearheaded by Prince William and Kate Middleton. Financed largely by taxes on fossil fuels, Costa Rica has handed more than $500 million to landowners over the past 20 years to protect forests and watersheds. The effort has largely reversed deforestation in the country. While the prize money is nice, the international recognition serves as a proof of concept for other nations, and a pat on the back for forward-thinking Costa Rica. Forward-thinking was the praise Georgia thought it might reap when the country broke ground on its, quote, hyper-modern Parliament building a decade ago. Today, though, it sits empty, and its glass windows meant to signal government transparency gather dust. Done in by its distance from the capital and the new political regime's distaste for it, the building was abandoned in 2018, then put up for sale through May of 2021, when the government finally gave up on finding a buyer. As Georgia gave up on its governmental greenhouse, Oman announced their aim to build a massive green hydrogen plant. Oman's following the forward-thinking theme by working to smooth an impending economic transition as 85% of the country's GDP is generated from oil and gas\u2014resources which the country is quickly running out of. Powered by wind and solar, it's hoped that the $30 billion project will be producing and exporting renewable energy at full capacity by 2038. In the very same year that Barbados ended symbolic ties with the Queen of England and became a republic, the nation's most famous export, Rihanna, became a national hero. Well, technically the artist, entrepreneur, and proud Bajan has been a national icon in the country for more than a decade, but this year her legendary status became official when the new republic's prime minister designated her a national hero. Already an ambassador for the Caribbean country, and recently named the world's richest female musician, it seems that Rihanna's reign just won't let up, and Barbados is all the better for it. At the other end of the Caribbean, three Cubans survived 33 days on a barren Bahamian island before being rescued by the US Coast Guard. After capsizing at sea, likely in an attempt to flee Cuba, the three washed up on one of the least hospitable Bahamas, surviving on coconut water, conch shells, and rats. After receiving brief medical attention in Florida, the resourceful survivors were handed over to US Immigration and Customs Enforcement. This isn't the first time the Bahamas have found itself as the meeting point between Cuban defectors and the US, as a similar rescue took place a few islands over, not months before this one. The Bahamas have hardly been the focal point for dangerous American migrations, though. It's been a record-breaking year for Panama immigration officials as a whopping 70,000 migrants from around the world have passed through the Darien Gap and into the country. Such incredible numbers making their way through the undeveloped, densely forested, and crime-riddled route with no formal roadways has pushed Panamanian and Colombian officials to begin regulating the number of entrants into the Darien Gap\u2014potentially a first step in making the journey safer for the desperate migrants. International collaboration was the context that informed an embarrassing development in Bulgaria. Led by the US Army, the NATO military exercise called Swift Response brought together 7,000 paratroopers from ten member nations for some joint practice. Swift Response, though, quickly became seriously regrettable when American soldiers accidentally left the training zone and barged into and cleared out a Bulgarian sunflower oil factory. The factory has since filed a lawsuit while the US Embassy, for its part, has apologized for the mistake. Netflix further expanded its reach when it greenlit the company's first feature-length film shot in Uruguay. The company's VP of Latin American Content has hailed the project as an exciting opportunity to highlight the creative talent in the country. While it's unlikely that viewers will recognize names when the credits roll, the film, named Togo, will fit right in in the current cinematic canon as the crime revolves around street-level drug trafficking and organized crime. Following the appearance of mysterious metallic monoliths across the American West and in Romania, a similar structure appeared in southwest Turkey, but this one came with a message in ancient Turkish\u2014quote, look at the sky and you will see the moon. Residents didn't have to wait long on an explanation as to the origins of the structure and its innocuous truism, though, as only days after its discovery, President Erdogan used the monolith as a background when he announced the country's new space program and ten-year vision, proving the monolith's function as an eye-rolling gimmick. By overlooking tradition at the Tokyo Olympics, one sprinter, rather than running for her country, ran away from it. Accusing her coaches of negligence before being pulled from her event and pressured to return home to Belarus, Kristina Sayu-Muskaja fled to the Polish embassy where she was granted a humanitarian visa. The incident exemplifies the mounting pressure on Belarusian public figures under the country's increasingly authoritarian government as she joins a growing list of athletes, coaches, and high-profile Belarusians that have faced job loss, arrest, or imprisonment when voicing discontent with the government in the past two years. State overreach is also the fear in Russia, as the Moscow Metro has implemented a new method of payment at over 240 stations called FacePay. As the program's name suggests, Moscow commuters can now leave their phone and wallet at home and simply smile for the camera to board the train. In a country where governmental transparency is hard to come by and facial recognition has been allegedly used to identify protestors, FacePay has human rights groups and dubious citizens concerned by the project's potential ulterior motives. In another former Soviet state, government officials made a statement as to where their current allegiances lie when they kicked out an outspoken US-Russian dual national. Receiving a letter notifying he was barred from entry into Kazakhstan, Gene Bunnan, who founded a victim's database to track the incarceration of Uyghurs in western China, serves as an example as to how closely Kazakhstan has come to align itself with China, not only turning a blind eye to what the US and UN have come to define as genocide, but now seemingly helping to quiet dissent within its own borders. While some bonds are strengthening in Central Asia, others in the Pacific are beginning to crumble. The result of a vote on the new Secretary-General for the Pacific Islands Forum was the last straw for the tiny Micronesian country of Palau, who announced they'd be leaving the organization. The coalition long had an informal tradition of rotating its Secretary-General position between Micronesian, Polynesian, and Melanesian politicians, but the election of a Cook Islands politician was a break from convention that left Micronesian nations like Palau and other small island states that would follow their lead, feeling slighted and voiceless in the organization's proceedings. Trophy hunting of large carnivores is banned in Romania, but that didn't stop Prince Emmanuel von Unzerlichtenstein of Austria from shooting the country's, and potentially the European Union's, single largest brown bear. While the Prince had authorization from the Romanian government to hunt a female nuisance bear causing problems for a small farm town, he managed to bag the massive 17-year-old Arthur, whether by accident or intentionally, is under investigation. In another mountainous Eastern European country, construction crews put the finishing touches on a state-of-the-art highway that cuts through rugged Montenegro. Rather than celebrating, though, residents are beginning to ask questions about the road's one billion dollar price tag. The road only connects a few small communities, including the town at its terminus, Matasevo, home to a population of 15. An early Belt and Road project built by Chinese crews, Montenegro's finances are now seriously strained by the road that really doesn't serve much of a purpose. The people of Brunei are hoping for more sage decision-making from the new CEO of the nation's largest financial institution, Bank Islam Brunei Dar Es Salaam. Hij Nouriani will be the first female CEO of the bank that manages $10 billion of assets and has expanded across Southeast Asia and into the Middle East in recent years. After naming three women to top positions in 2019, the move follows an empowering trend at the bank in the traditionally conservative country. In Argentina, a 30-year-old confirmed an age-old maxim\u2014if it's too good to be true, then true, it usually is. Searching for an explanation for a momentary Google outage, Nicolas Corona found that the domain google.com.ar had expired, and that he could buy it for a modest $2.60. The Argentine quickly scooped up the domain that, if everything broke his way, could be worth millions. The domain didn't prove a golden ticket, though, but a mistake as Google's ownership hadn't lapsed, but in the end, Corona came out of the situation a few dollars lighter. And a country that's been in the headlines for all the wrong reasons in the past few years has emerged a more positive story. Rolls-Royce and Qatar announced a multi-year, multi-billion dollar partnership aimed to foster green technology companies. The partnership will build two campuses, one in each country, create an estimated 1,000 jobs, and hopefully provide the resources and facilities for sustainability-oriented startups to take off. Prosecc and Prosecco are two different types of wine with two different names. Almost how different the names are, though, has Croatia and Italy at loggerheads. Croatia has sought to trademark the name of their Prosecc with the European Commission under the assumption that consumers would be able to differentiate it from Italian Prosecco. Italian wine aficionados think differently, and are fighting the move on account of potential confusion. Italians also see the effort as an attack on Italian products more broadly, as Prosecco is a denomination of controlled origin\u2014a wine that only comes from a specific region. The world's largest mammal, the blue whale, only feeds in a few specific regions\u2014one of which is off the coast of Chilean Patagonia. Unfortunately for the endangered species, the water is also teeming with fishing vessels working the busy salmon farming industry, with up to 1,000 boats a day passing through the feeding grounds. This traffic has led to a handful of fatal collisions between boat and blue whale. With the regional population estimated to be only in the hundreds, conservationists are scrambling to figure out a compromise that gives the whales a bit more room. Bahrain is keen on finding a bit more room, too\u2014so keen, in fact, that the archipelago nation announced plans to expand its landmass by 60%. The island-building initiative will enlarge Bahrain's footprint, construct five new cities, and, the government hopes, attract billions in foreign investment. The project is set to build out tourist attractions, a sports city, and a commercial zone. From sports cities to sports washing, it was a big year for professional athletics in Saudi Arabia. Despite its high-profile, highly controversial takeover of Newcastle United, the country also announced a partnership between Gulf Saudi and the Asian tour that'll keep a Saudi stomp on Asia's preeminent Gulf circuit and provide prize funding for a decade to come. While a quieter development than the Newcastle deal, many denounced the move as another attempt to move conversation and attention away from the country's human rights record with glitz and games. Issues with human rights records will be impossible to miss if the Chinese Fudan University is to follow through with building a campus in Budapest, Hungary. Many of the city's population oppose the project, and the city's mayor has called it an instance of, quote, Chinese influence buying. Residents are becoming increasingly creative in their pushback, recently renaming nearby streets Uyghur Martyrs, Dalai Lama, and Free Hong Kong Road. One car skipped the streets entirely on its way from the Nitra Airport in Slovakia to that in Bratislava\u2014instead, the prototype flew the 35-minute route. For Klein Vision's aircar, it was the 142nd landing, but an important first too as the car successfully transitioned into normal car mode in just minutes. While behind on the timeline that science fiction authors envisioned, flying cars are slowly coming around with Klein, Hyundai, and GM leading the way. Portugal's parliament pushed into the future of labor when it passed progressive measures to protect its increasingly online workforce. In response to the shift to working from home, new laws bar employers from contacting employees during off-hours, allow parents of children under eight to work from home without bosses' approval, and require employers to pitch in on employees' electricity costs. The move comes in response to the pandemic, but also as an effort to protect Portugal's reputation as an attractive place for digital nomads to set up shop. Finding the remains of a different sort of nomad in Latvia cast doubt on previous theories as to the dramatic decline of Stone Age peoples across Western Europe 5,000 years ago. DNA analysis of a hunter-gatherer showed the man died of the plague, making him the earliest victim of what was thought to have caused the mysterious population decline. Analysis, however, also showed that the strain he carried didn't spread easily, and caused milder symptoms than iterations that would follow. Now, rather than plague, scientists are looking at climate change as a catalyst. Successful Spanish YouTubers are making like wealthy bankers and professional athletes before them, and running to the hills of Andorra. One Spanish creator called Andorra the quote, Silicon Valley of YouTube, as the country has quickly developed into a creative meeting place, luring in the like-minded with light taxes, relative anonymity, and less stringent lockdown policies. The move has been a boon for Andorra's sputtering economy, and a real loss for Spain's, where local media has gone so far as to call Spanish YouTubers relocating unpatriotic. A sputtering economy, many feel, would be the result should Poland pivot away from coal. Currently, 70% of the country's energy comes from the non-renewable super polluter, and coal companies and miner unions hold serious political power. But Poland's appetite, and the massive strip mine on its border, are running Czech wells dry, or at least so the Czech Republic accuses. Citing European environmental laws, the Czech Republic has sued Poland, setting off a wave of conspiracy theories across coal country. Conspiratorial might seem like a good way to describe Lithuania's defense ministry calling for citizens to throw their Chinese-made cell phones away. The request, though, comes after the nation's cybersecurity center found that the Shomi Corp, a Chinese phone maker, have censored technology built into devices that track 449 terms, including the likes of Free Tibet and Democracy Movement. The finding comes as relationships between China and Lithuania sour over Taiwan. One internationally recognized state, one defiant self-identifying state, two UK military bases, and one UN buffer zone to keep the peace hint at Cyprus' geopolitical complexity. Things didn't get any simpler in 2021, when Turkish President Erdogan announced that in celebration of the 47th anniversary of Turkey invading the island, the country planned to resettle an abandoned and formerly Greek Cypriot tourist town. Celebrating an invasion with a different sort of invasion has received poor marks from the US, the UN, and Greek Cypriots. While heated geopolitical relations and politicians' hot air pose a threat in the Mediterranean, so too does literal heat. Greece, particularly vulnerable to climate change generally, and especially heat waves, has decided to begin to name the extreme bouts of heat. Categorizing heat waves is tricky, but any standardization will allow the country to better systematically respond to temperature upticks and communicate the danger. 2021 marked the end of the Free Latifa campaign, as the movement hatched three years ago finally saw its vision come to fruition. Princess Latifa was captured by her father, Dubai's Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, while trying to express a little self-determination and leave the United Arab Emirates. She had hardly been seen in the past three years, but it seems her confinement came to an abrupt end as an Instagram photo showed the princess traveling in Iceland, and a verifiable statement quoted her saying she could now, quote, travel where I want. Italian motorcyclists and golfers can now, within reason, travel where they want to, and do so in style. The historic Italian car company, ESO, is relaunching with a young backer from the famed lineage leading the way. Catching the company up with the present and charging it into the future, Ferruccio Lamborghini and team are launching a motorcycle and golf cart that are modern, stylish, and sustainable. Both vehicles are completely electric. A scarecrow of the seas may help to save lives of thousands of seabirds each year, thanks to researchers in Estonia who help develop a buoy with googly eyes. The device floats above small-scale fishing operation gillnets, which can be lethal to diving seabirds, and deters them from coming near. In fact, scientists found it reduced the congregating birds by about a quarter, who are turned off by eye contact and erratic buoy behavior. Another sort of deterrent is the addition of Malta to an international gray list kept by Financial Action Task Force\u2014a watchdog organization meant to monitor money laundering and terrorism funding. In recent years, the island nation's low tax rate for foreign companies has attracted substantial banking and investment, but that also makes it ripe for abuse. It's the first European Union nation to be listed, and could potentially affect the upward trajectory of Malta as wealthy investors look to alternate locations, given its now tenuous nature. One of Europe's wealthiest people, and the Czech Republic's richest man, Peter Kellner, was tragically killed in a helicopter crash while heli-skiing in Alaska, along with four additional passengers. Kellner was estimated to be worth $17.5 billion, and his death follows a string of recent fatal high-profile helicopter accidents, including Kobe Bryant and French billionaire Olivier Dussault. On the coast, France and the United Kingdom finally settled some post-Brexit bickering over fishing. France wanted the British government to issue a number of fishing licenses to small French boats so they could continue harvesting in British waters, and the Brits stalled, citing a number of technicalities from the French side. The issue simmered to a threat of trade sanctions level, but cooler heads prevailed, an agreement was met, and 83 fishing licenses were assigned before it reached a boiling point. Another agreement was reached in Spain, but this one pertains to many people's go-to source for the day's headlines\u2014Google News. Banned from the country for six years because Spain required Google to pay a central fee to media organizations for use of their stories, the new law now allows Google parent company Alphabet to negotiate directly with publishers for content. Now, more than 1,000 Spanish media organizations can be sourced for news from a single smartphone. Speaking of smartphones, it may have gone unnoticed in your Apple-happy world, but South Korean manufacturer LG announced its departure from the phone market. Once ranked only behind Apple and Samsung for smartphone manufacturing, the company has had a series of bad reviews and technical rollouts, prompting it to shift its focus to other areas, such as connected devices for home, robotics, and artificial intelligence. LG joins Ericsson and HTC in the cell phone graveyard. Smart is also the way to describe Amazon's accountants. The company had a record-breaking 2020 in Europe, hauling in some $50 billion, but it managed to pay zero in corporate taxes to Luxembourg, home to its European headquarters. Of course, it's all legal, but when a company not only doesn't pay anything, but also declares losses which result in tax credits to the tune of $63 million, there was some definite eye-rolling and belt-tightening from policymakers looking to benefit from the boom. The government in Slovenia is running an alleged crusade against culture, with Prime Minister J\u00e9nez Jensa replacing the heads of several arts organizations in what some are calling a shift to more conservative approaches. Jensa, who had served twice in the role prior to being ousted for corruption, named new leaders for the National Museum, the Museum of Contemporary History, and Moderna Galleria, and he continues to terminate leases from arts organizations that rent space from the government. He denies that it's an orchestrated movement, but for many, it's hard to paint over the facts. Low government limitations have led to a hot streak of gambling development in Liechtenstein, one of the world's smallest countries, now home to five casinos. That may sound like a so-so number, but it puts it per capita above Monaco, Macau, and Las Vegas' Clark County. One reason? The gambling tax rate is lower than in neighboring countries, and the government there hasn't set caps on the number of casinos that can be built. Five more are in the pipeline, which means the foreign investors largely responsible for them are betting big on the future. Tensions are rising between Japan and the tandem of China and Russia. While they've been escalating for years because of Beijing's increased presence on islands controlled by Japan but claimed by Russia, they hit a new high when a ten-ship Chinese-Russian flotilla circumnavigated Japan's main island this summer. China and Russia say it was merely a diplomatic exercise, but Japan is worried a threatening presence mean it will need to increase defense spending and be more on guard. Spying seems to be a trend, but the United States told Israel they don't want to play that game. Daily spyware maker NSO Group was placed on an American blacklist after it was reasonably confirmed that the NSO's signature product, Pegasus, was used by foreign governments against dissidents, journalists, diplomats, and clergy members. The blacklisting means, among other things, that NSO won't be able to buy components from US companies for its products\u2014something Apple is ensuring after suing the group this year as well. Austrian tourism officials want to encourage viewing of the country's nude sculptures and paintings that pepper museums, but social media platforms' censorship policies have made their promotion difficult. So, Vienna did what anyone trying to get around the no private parts policy would do\u2014they opened an account on the adults-only app Onlyfans. Many of the works are critical to national cultural history, and now they're free to promote the exhibitions without that fuzzy bar. 2021 wasn't all spying, censorship, and general contention\u2014there were positive developments too. United States-based dictionary.com named allyship its word of the year. Originally added to dictionary.com in 2021, allyship rose in popularity during the Black Lives Matter movements across the world, but its definition makes clear that its applications are even farther reaching. One says, quote, the role of a person who advocates for inclusion of a marginalized or politicized group in solidarity but not as a member. More word searches means there's certainly more of this going on. This is a story about the good guy winning, but this time, it's a lobster. A Canadian grocer noticed that no one was purchasing a certain carrot-colored crustacean, but on top of that, it was being picked on by other lobsters in the tank. After several weeks, he bought the lobster himself and donated it to the Toronto Aquarium, where it was discovered his strange hue was a one in 30 million genetic mutation. Pinchy, the lobster, avoided the plate and now has a more permanent, public home. In an effort to speed up the development of more homebuilding in New Zealand, to combat the 30% increase in housing costs and shortage of inventory, officials are cutting red tape and making it easier for developers to address a housing crisis so dire that it's drawn international attention. Specifically, they're changing some density regulations, allowing for up to three homes of three stories on one site, versus one home of two stories\u2014a move that some predict will erect 48,000 to 106,000 new homes in the next five to eight years. Expansion is something that a Belgian farmer accidentally did when he moved a several hundred pound stone seven feet into France. The historic markers delineate the borders between the two countries, and a team of Frenchmen who patrol the remote countryside verifying the positions noticed the errant stone. Luckily, the farmer wasn't charged with violating the international treaty that certifies the border\u2014a crime that could have resulted in a territorial war instead of a slap on the wrist. To the north, the United Kingdom is rapidly trying to make up for centuries of contributing to climate change. To that end, it launched the world's most powerful tidal turbine off the port of Dundee, creating enough electricity for 2,000 homes, and Rolls-Royce announced the development of 16 smaller, cheaper nuclear power plants to electrify one million homes. Britain is already one of the largest wind energy producers in the world\u2014not bad for the country that started the Industrial Revolution. Have you ever heard of Grab or a SPAC? In this story, we have both. Grab is a Singapore-based super app that offers everything from ride-sharing to banking in one tap. SPAC is a special purpose acquisition company\u2014an investment strategy in which a larger company merges with a publicly traded shell company in order to exploit going public. Grab signed a $39.5 billion merger deal with a US SPAC, which brought the company public on the NASDAQ stock exchange on December 2nd. That makes it the largest ever deal of its kind, and means we should pay attention to both SPACs and Grab ASAP. Finland has a lot going for it, including being named the happiest country in the world for the fourth consecutive year. But one thing it can't nail is labor retention, and, in fact, one study shows a major reason foreign students leave Helsinki within their first year of graduating is the language barrier. These difficulties prompted the mayor to suggest transitioning the capital city to speaking English primarily\u2014that may help employment, but TBD on happiness. We've talked a lot about ways to create green energy. Another way to fight climate change is by consuming less meat, and Denmark is leading the European Union in this effort by giving $90 million to farmers who produce plant-based foods over the next five years. The country eats a lot of pork, but the sale of plant-based foods there has increased by $8 million in two years. Things might not fly, and they might not be the only thing on the menu anymore, either. Just to the southwest, officials in the Netherlands unveiled a plan to reduce the country's livestock by one-third over the next 13 years, but it's for a different reason\u2014there's too much poop. The country has over one million cattle, chickens, and pigs\u2014the highest density in Europe\u2014and can't quite contain their waste without polluting important waterways. Farmers, naturally, are pushing back, even though the multi-billion dollar plan intends to pay them to essentially exit the industry. Maybe they can jump on Denmark's plant-based paddy wagon. Also planning for the future is the 2032 Olympic Committee, and specifically, Australia. It was announced that Brisbane will be the host of the Summer Games in ten years, and what's notable about this election isn't the place, but the process. Instead of expensive, competitive, and often corrupt bidding wars pitting cities against one another, bids are now submitted and then reviewed behind closed doors by selection committees\u2014in this case, the best mate won. In Sweden, Magdalena Anderson won but wasn't too happy with her first day on the job, so the Swedish Prime Minister resigned just 12 hours in because the Junior Green Party also quit, throwing her coalition into chaos. She indicated she'd lead a social-Democrat single-party and was re-elected a week later, becoming the first female Prime Minister of Sweden\u2014for a second time. The second time was not as successful for a criminal in Germany, whose first crime involved a burglary in 2012. He got away with that one, and a bite of sausage, which left behind some DNA evidence that the police held onto. Fast forward to today, when he committed a more violent crime, and the genetic residue linked him to the decade-old heist through an international information sharing library. However, the statute of limitations expired, and he's gone free\u2014proving there's no bite out of crime this time. So, we're five from the end, and the truth is a lot of headlines you missed are about the way these recent, more developed countries are adapting and attacking climate change. Iceland started operating the world's first direct air capture technology, which turned CO2 into rock, but perhaps more quirky is that the country also performed the world's first double arm and shoulder transplant to replace the limbs a man lost in a work accident more than two decades prior. Progress on the micro- and macro-level is something to high-five about. Now a quick disclaimer before this next story\u2014the UN lists 189 HDI scores, and while a vast majority of those scores correlate to countries, the UN makes sure to acknowledge their list is a compilation of, quote, 189 countries and UN-recognized territories. We've now arrived at the only territory on their list, and while technically not a country, we figured the more news the better so we've gone ahead and included the Chinese territory of Hong Kong. Disney Plus finally launched in Hong Kong in 2021, and while much of the streaming service's content provides a needed escape from the chaos and confusion that's embroiled the Chinese territory in the past few years, one omission from the Simpsons catalog hints at just how inescapable the tension has become. Noticeably absent was episode 12 of season 16 that has the Simpson family visiting China, and specifically Tiananmen Square, and while minor for plot purposes, its disappearance signals the increasing reach of government censorship in the traditionally independent city. The Swiss are notoriously on time, but they were late to join the same-sex marriage party. The country finally approved a marriage-for-all initiative with two-thirds voting in favor, becoming one of the last Western European countries to do so. Switzerland, known for neutrality, is slow on inclusivity issues, and didn't allow women the right to vote until 1971, so this, though sluggish in adoption, is a cultural win. It also took a while for Irish authorities to come down on enforcing the European Union's three-year-old General Data Protection Regulation, which is a comprehensive data privacy law. But they served META's WhatsApp with a $270 million fine for not being transparent on how it uses people's data across the company's platforms. Many tech companies' headquarters are based in Ireland, where corporate tax rates are low, so there may be more cases like this, which of course is being contested by WhatsApp, to come. And finally, it feels appropriate to end on a note that reminds us about the scale of humanity. In Norway, a large meteor lit up the summer night sky for five to six seconds before, in all likelihood, crashing into a densely wooded area about 40 miles or 60 kilometers west of the country's capital. Some people reported a strong wind created by the pressure from it, and while it may take years to find its physical remains, the blazing meteor, for a fleeting moment, captured the attention of thousands of onlookers\u2014a rare instance of singularity in an ever-individual world. Of course, the news doesn't stop with Norway, nor does it end with the end of the year, but you don't have to wait for us to highlight interesting stories that may have fallen through the cracks.
