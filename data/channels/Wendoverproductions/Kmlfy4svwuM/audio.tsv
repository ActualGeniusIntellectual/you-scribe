0	3280	So, you want to build a road.
3280	6920	First is perhaps the most impossible feat—finding a route.
6920	11080	That's because roads have a particular shape that Earth often does not.
11080	16280	Both linearly and laterally, they're fairly flat, but not completely flat—flat roads
16280	17280	are dangerous.
17280	21580	A flat turn will increase the potential of a car skidding off, so road designers slope
21580	25800	the corners inward to counteract centripetal force and give the car more friction.
25800	29440	The higher the speed and the sharper the turn, the more slope the turn needs, meaning there
29440	32760	is a theoretically safest slope for a turn.
32760	36700	The American Federal Highway Administration has a formula that converts design speed and
36700	41400	turn radius into a suggested slope, but that's only their interpretation of it.
41400	45280	Road designers and mathematicians endlessly shoot academic papers back and forth debating
45280	48400	the merits of this and other superelevation formulas.
48400	52000	Some suggest more severe banking on turns to accommodate the higher centers of gravity
52000	55760	of trucks, others argue that steeper slopes are not worth the benefit due to the issues
55760	60120	they create for slower-moving vehicles in the event of snow and ice, and it gets far
60120	61820	more complex than that.
61820	66100	But this is all largely irrelevant because, at the very, very most, the sideways slope
66100	70360	will be about 12%, but it's normally quite a bit less and it's only on corners, so
70360	74600	overall a relatively flat cross-section is needed regardless.
74600	79340	Linearly, in the direction of travel, even less of a slope is tolerated.
79340	82860	In order to allow heavily loaded trucks to safely climb and descend, highways should
82860	87140	rise or fall no more than six vertical feet or meters for every hundred horizontal.
87140	92700	So, in combination, the narrow accepted range of linear and lateral slopes presents a challenge
92700	98380	when you need a road to go over this—Colorado's Rocky Mountains.
98380	104060	Originally, America's interstate designers didn't dare attempt to traverse these peaks.
104060	108260	I-70 was originally supposed to end in Denver, leaving the state as the only in the region
108260	110980	without a trans-mountain interstate.
110980	115860	After intense lobbying, though, Washington relented—designers would have to find a
115860	117300	route through.
117300	121740	The E. Lionel Pavlo Engineering Company was tasked with identifying the cheapest, flattest
121740	123300	route through the mountains.
123300	126860	One year later, they returned with these seven options.
126860	130460	At first glance, the northern route seemed best, as it best subscribed to one of the
130460	134660	most tried and tested road routing shortcuts—rivers.
134660	138620	You see, any route through the mountains is going to require a certain amount of earthwork.
138660	143180	If the slope is perpendicular to the road, you cut a flat section into the slope at great
143180	148300	expense—by one estimate, a 50% slope doubles construction costs.
148300	152980	But using earth to achieve the required gradient in the linear direction is even more expensive,
152980	156540	simply due to the sheer distance and volume of earth involved.
156540	160920	So, considering they're either going to need to flatten linearly or laterally, road
160920	163660	builders would much rather do so laterally.
163660	166500	The best place to find routes like this is by rivers.
166540	171260	That's because they typically center mountain valleys and fall rather gradually—for example,
171260	176540	the mighty Colorado River only drops about a mile of elevation across the 280 it traverses
176540	180980	through the state, despite being surrounded by terrain steep enough for a mile of elevation
180980	184300	gain to occur over a mile of horizontal distance.
184300	188780	The gentle riverside linear gradient is perfect for road construction, leaving the primary
188780	193180	gradient correction to the lateral direction, which can be done at lesser expense.
193220	198460	Therefore, on a per-mile basis, this northern route was far cheaper and less complex—the
198460	202100	only section that couldn't easily sit at a reasonable grade was here, traversing the
202100	204920	Continental Divide, where they'd need to build a tunnel.
204920	208940	But after that, the road would follow the Fraser and Colorado Rivers, each shepherding
208940	211620	a flat, mellow path through the mountains.
211620	216380	But the Pavlo Engineering Company didn't ultimately suggest this route.
216380	221400	Its justification was first that this northern area of Colorado was relatively sparsely populated,
221400	224840	even by Rocky Mountain standards, meaning this route would be of lesser use to those
224840	227440	actually living in the state rather than traversing.
227440	232120	And perhaps more crucially, even with the relatively simple geography, it was a far
232120	234280	longer, less direct route.
234280	237940	This meant that, even though the southern route would require traversing two high-elevation
237940	243880	passes rather than one, Pavlo thought it could be built for some $55 million less—it would
243880	246320	just require some creativity.
246320	249560	Inevitably, this route too would require a tunnel.
249560	253120	That's because it crossed the Continental Divide—the geographic split between the
253120	256720	side of the country where rivers drain into the Atlantic and the side where they drain
256720	258000	into the Pacific.
258000	262000	Inherently, rivers from one side don't connect to those on the other, meaning there generally
262000	266640	are not mellow mountain valleys for roads to follow up and across the Divide—there's
266640	271900	simply a wall of massively high, massively steep peaks, meaning traversing it was going
271900	276000	to require either a massive feat of engineering to create an interstate-standard road climbing
276000	280800	up to nearly 12,000 feet or 3,700 meters, or the construction of the world's highest
280800	285280	elevation road tunnel at 11,000 feet or 3,400 meters.
285280	290000	Incredibly, given the gradients and weather in the area, the tunnel was ultimately selected
290000	292400	as the more practical option.
292400	294320	That left the other pass.
294320	297320	The interstate was definitely going to go through Silverthorne, and it was definitely
297320	301680	going to go through Vail, but standing between the two towns was a similarly formidable stretch
301680	302680	of mountains.
302680	307200	Initially, the answer was to just go straight—climb up this valley, then tunnel under Red Buffalo
307200	308200	Pass.
308200	312180	This would require building a similarly daunting tunnel, but it would keep the highway on its
312180	314720	straight, efficient route through the state.
314720	318760	The only issue was that the land surrounding this pass was part of the Forest Service's
318760	322920	Eagle's Nest Wilderness Area—a stretch of pristine, protected nature that was not
322920	324920	supposed to be disturbed by anything.
324920	330480	This, along with the ascent of the environmental movement more broadly, led to massive public
330480	331480	pushback.
331480	334320	It was argued that it was bad enough for the highway to be disturbing the environmentally
334320	338700	sensitive area at all, but for it to pass through one of the highest categories of protected
338700	340680	land was simply untenable.
340680	345780	As the official in charge of the Forest Service, the final call rested in the hands of Orville
345780	348520	Freeman, the Secretary of Agriculture.
348520	353280	In a shock decision, after alignment planning had already started on the Red Buffalo route,
353280	358020	he said no—I-70 would have to divert elsewhere.
358020	361120	The alternative was clear—Vail Pass.
361120	366680	With its more manageable gradients and comparatively lower 10,600-foot 3,200-meter elevation, this
366680	369400	route could actually be navigated without a tunnel.
369400	373760	The downside was that the 10 miles, or 16 kilometers in added length would lead to an
373760	378880	estimated 94 cents in additional fuel and maintenance cost for every driver.
378880	384240	But at least, after years of debate, study, surveying, and consensus building, finally
384240	388080	Colorado's Trans Mountain Interstate had a route.
388080	391940	Now they just needed to turn it into reality.
391940	395040	Up to this point, much of the work had been done from top down.
395040	400360	When it's time to build, though, this orientation flips, as road construction happens, one layer
400360	403120	at a time, from the bottom up.
403120	408640	Vail Pass is undeniably steep, but by Rocky Mountain standards, not impossibly steep.
408640	413000	In fact, while the section from Vail to Vail Pass reaches a grade over the preferred range
413000	419160	of 0-6%, the pass averages roughly a Colorado-comfortable 4.5% grade.
419160	424240	Linear grade, in other words, was a challenge, but the lateral would prove an even bigger
424240	425240	headache.
425240	429760	To transform undulating, unruly topography into a uniform transportation throughway,
429760	433880	planners start by turning in their overhead projections for a map of a different sort—a
433880	434880	sidecut.
434880	438900	Now it's time to create a path flat enough and wide enough for a road.
438900	442860	This starts with building a road base which, in turn, requires the earth-moving processes
442860	447380	of cutting and filling—processes straightforward enough that their name does most of the explaining,
447380	450020	fill earth where it's needed, and cut away where it isn't.
450020	454140	At its simplest, cutting and filling begins first with surveying in the field, then with
454140	458420	measurements made, moves to paper, becoming an exercise in rudimentary math.
458420	463820	First, the proposed route is broken into 100-foot or 30-meter sections called stations, then,
463820	467820	at each station or half-station, planners look at the sidecut and figure out where dirt
467820	470300	needs to be added and where it needs to be removed.
470740	474860	If a road's going into a hillside, for instance, the cut will be on the uphill side, the fill
474860	478500	on the downhill side, with the earth from the cut being moved to the fill.
478500	482020	On flat land, there's likely to be more fill than cut as a road will be positioned
482020	485660	to sit higher than its surroundings so water will shed off the road's shoulder rather
485660	486660	than pool.
486660	489860	Once the amount of earth required to move is figured out at one particular station,
489860	494940	it's on to the next station to do the same math, then the next, then the next after that.
494940	498400	And once all these values are figured out, the planar now has a rough sense as to how
498400	502180	much earth will need to be moved, and how much time, material, and money it will cost
502180	504800	across the entire length of the roadway.
504800	509280	According to a Florida Department of Transportation cost-estimating model, this part of the process—cutting
509280	513260	and filling or excavating and embanking for a divided four-lane highway across a rural
513260	518360	landscape would cost in itself over $1 million a mile, which makes up nearly a quarter of
518360	519560	the per-mile price.
519560	523820	Though a task that's easy to wrap one's head around, it's one that requires a fundamental
523820	527460	reshaping of a landscape, and thus, a lot of money.
527460	531860	And this estimates for the flat state of Florida, not Colorado, a state where protruding peaks
531860	537420	and a rocky disposition make it easy for earth-moving costs to shoot a mile high.
537420	542980	Before I-70 crested over Vail Pass, it was US Highway 6, a small two-lane road cut into
542980	547640	the north side of the canyon that was notorious for its sharp turns and difficult driving.
547640	551780	It was dangerous to the point that motorists often avoided it, opting for the smoother,
551780	554900	safer, but exceptionally indirect US 40.
554900	559020	To build a bigger road, effectively two US 6s, while making the road safe enough to move
559020	565060	unfamiliar Americans across at a 60-mile-per-hour clip, there would need to be a lot more earthwork.
565060	569480	But in such a tight space, and such a pristine and delicate environment, there would also
569480	570940	be major constraints.
570940	573620	The first was this tiny creek.
573620	579240	While a waterway that only a fraction of Coloradans can actually name, Blackgore Creek was and
579240	583660	is critical to the communities below, filling the recreational reservoirs near the pass,
583660	587020	applying drinking water to Vail, and eventually dedicating its flow to a section of creek
587020	590700	below the town of Vail that's earned the distinction as a gold-metal water for trout
590700	591700	fishing.
591700	595620	Blackgore Creek is important—locals knew as much and federal planners knew as much—so
595620	599780	when it came to figure out where to flatten out enough space for a road base, the question
599780	603860	of what it would do to the watershed became an important one.
603860	606200	Runoff is a tricky business in road building.
606200	610380	It first presents a challenge during construction, but handled improperly will remain a challenge
610380	612220	for the lifespan of a road.
612220	616580	On Vail Pass, this challenge was exacerbated by perpetually sandy soils, rapid snowmelt
616580	619780	in late spring, and pounding rainfall in mid-summer.
619780	624200	With the passage of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1970, I-70 contractors were
624200	628020	just beginning to understand environmental impact statements and pollution laws when
628020	631140	they were awarded contracts to get the interstate over the mountain.
631140	636880	Now, rather than just being fast, they had to be diligent too, or face the fines.
636880	640980	City officials downstream from the project, for their part, were concerned about construction,
640980	644660	as the loose soil at the pass was already silting up the town's water supply before
644660	648140	any construction tore out grass and vegetation upslope.
648140	652940	So contractors, as they do today, meticulously tested the water to ensure that sediment hadn't
652940	655540	risen to unacceptable levels under their watch.
655540	659700	To keep these levels low during construction, teams placed hay bales and sandbags to slow
659700	662380	runoff and direct it to settlement basins.
662380	665980	Water would inevitably make it to the stream, but if they slowed it and let the particles
665980	669820	settle to the bottom, it wouldn't carry too much dirt down with it.
669820	672580	But these are temporary problems with temporary fixes.
672580	676100	There's also the challenge of dealing with water once a road's complete, and this is
676100	680520	such a critical concern of road building that the US Department of Transportation Project
680520	685340	Development and Design Manual dedicates an entire chapter to the subject of water.
685340	689580	Basically, the question this entire chapter revolves around is how to best move water
689580	693980	around and off roadways without ruining the nearby surroundings.
693980	697860	The answer begins above the cut and starts during the construction phase.
697900	701980	The very moment a road base is established, it's a race to revegetate the slope above
701980	706220	the road with grasses and shrubbery that will hold the land in place when it rains.
706220	710700	Generally, planners look to keep the uphill slope no steeper than a ratio of 2 to 1.
710700	715420	For every two units the slope extends horizontally, it may safely rise one.
715420	720380	With a harsher environment, Vail Pass planners opted for slopes of 2.5 to 1 or less and to
720380	724340	give grasses their best chance, sprayed hillsides with mulch on the steepest sections, and placed
724340	726460	netting to help the seed take hold.
726460	730780	For natural depressions that served as drainages for the hillsides, teams placed thirsty willows
730780	734500	and boulders to both naturalize the landscape and slow the flow.
734500	739120	On Vail Pass, and generally in highway construction, builders will make the most of these perpendicular
739120	743160	drainages and actually cut uphill ditches running parallel with the road to divert runoff
743160	746700	headed for highway to the drainage, then below via culvert.
746700	750960	Where applicable, paralleling ditches, culverts, and revegetation have proved tried and true
750960	755680	techniques to manage runoff and mitigate erosion in Colorado and elsewhere, but in the narrow
755680	761780	confines below the pass, neither simple cut-and-fills nor their drainage systems were always applicable.
761780	765620	To ensure that road fill wouldn't spill into Black Gore or Ten Mile Creek, planners
765620	768220	instead opted for retaining walls.
768220	772940	Where rock formations made a smooth 2 to 1 cut impossible, explosives blasted shear walls
772940	777160	out of troublesome rock formations while netting and planted topsoil placed above mitigated
777160	778480	future rockfall.
778480	781960	And most unique to this particular section of Interstate are the sections neither blown
781960	786100	into the rock nor cut into the mountainside, but the 23 separate sections of the interstate
786100	790180	that float across the landscape on bridges that were placed to account for the fact that
790180	795180	almost the entire road from Vail to the pass sits on a fault line and a series of still-shifting
795180	796820	historical landslides.
796820	801520	With the cuts and fills, the exposed rock cuts, and the bridges, this section of roadway
801520	806360	is practically a highway-building handbook on its own, and as an exemplary road of nearly
806360	810900	every trick and technique available to road engineers, it wasn't cheap.
810900	816680	When Vail Pass was proudly dedicated in 1978, estimates put the cost of the 24-mile, 39-kilometer
816680	823960	section at an estimated $91 million—adjusted for inflation, that's nearly $427 million
823960	829080	total, $18 million per mile, or $11 million per kilometer.
829080	833380	And yet, with all that money spent, driving over Vail Pass doesn't feel as if you're
833380	836780	passing over an engineering marvel that's conquered a landscape, but rather a road that
836780	838960	almost seems a part of it.
838960	842620	With a delicate landscape front of mind, while crossing Forest Service land and connecting
842620	847100	ski resorts and a host of other recreation hotspots, every last detail along the pass,
847100	851300	from the red-tinged concrete to match the local rock, boulders strewn across revegetation
851300	855180	areas, and Frank Lloyd Wright-inspired retaining walls to the manner in which rock was blasted
855180	858880	to make it look more natural, this section of interstate was built to fit the landscape
858880	863140	and the values of the area around it—something that's not lost on contemporary planners
863140	867720	who have carefully codified these specific design traits for future additions or alterations
867720	868780	on the pass.
868780	872480	In this way, though, I-70's the same as any other road—designed uniquely to fit
872480	876440	its environment and best serve a particular purpose.
876440	879860	But even once designed and built for that environment, the environment is constantly
879860	885080	shifting which means that roads, especially those as complex as I-70, need constant management
885080	886940	in order to stay safe.
886940	891400	With its tight turns, steep gradients, and volatile weather, the entirety of this road
891400	895160	is treacherous, but with their inherently limited resources, the Colorado Department
895160	899200	of Transportation focuses its efforts most on the sections that are most dangerous and
899200	901580	most disruptive to close down.
901580	906740	Eisenhower Tunnel, that highest road tunnel in the US, is one such spot.
906740	910580	Even under the best conditions, the slower speeds of the tunnel turn it into a chokepoint
910580	913860	that causes massive, notorious traffic backlogs.
913860	918660	If the tunnel closes, an entire interstate's worth of traffic must divert onto the winding,
918660	924160	treacherous two-lane Loveland Pass which turns a bad traffic situation catastrophic.
924160	926180	But there simply are not alternatives.
926180	930620	The next shortest diversion is two hours long over another treacherous mountain pass, so
930620	935300	CDOT does everything possible to keep Eisenhower Tunnel open.
935300	937860	This starts with some controversial rules.
937860	942940	Hazmat trucks, carrying fuel, chemicals, or other hazardous materials, are not allowed
942940	943940	through the tunnel.
943940	948580	The logic is that a fuel tanker fire, for instance, would be absolutely catastrophic
948580	950140	in such an enclosed space.
950140	954020	While the tunnel does have its own fire department that can handle smaller incidents, it's
954020	958420	no location means that getting full resources to combat such a hazmat incident could take
958420	962960	hours, in which time the tunnel could be damaged to an extent that could take months or years
962960	966760	to fix, let alone the risks to any drivers trapped inside.
966760	971440	What this means is that hazmat trucks must take the treacherous Loveland Pass instead,
971440	977520	which CDOT plows up to its near 12,000-foot, 3,700-meter peak all through the winter, making
977520	980560	it Colorado's highest year-round road.
980580	984860	Of course, navigating a fuel tanker up a steep, winding road to 12,000 feet in the middle
984860	989280	of a Colorado winter is far from safe, so trucking industry advocates argue that this
989280	994060	policy is effectively trading the safety of truck drivers for the convenience of ski commuters,
994060	998380	but after a recent feasibility study reevaluating the policy, CDOT maintains that it's the
998380	1001380	best balance of safety overall.
1001380	1005020	But even I-70 itself is plenty treacherous in the winter.
1005020	1009500	After all, this is the highest elevation section of interstate in the US.
1009500	1013520	In their proximity to the Continental Divide, both sides of the tunnel are flanked by steep
1013520	1018300	mountain faces, and with steep mountain faces come avalanches.
1018300	1022960	This is Mount Bethel, and these two tree-free corridors are the telltale signs of an avalanche
1022960	1023960	path.
1023960	1027480	If an avalanche were to trigger without warning, the snow and debris could bury the roadway
1027480	1031880	for hours or even days, and potentially even bury people.
1031880	1034880	Therefore, CDOT triggers avalanches themselves.
1034880	1039480	At the start of each winter, the department positions Obelix trigger devices at the top
1039480	1042060	of slide paths on each side of the tunnel.
1042060	1046220	These remotely triggered egg-shaped capsules shoot out a concussive blast from the bottom
1046220	1049660	that, if the conditions are right, trigger an avalanche in the snow below.
1049660	1053420	This allows CDOT to close the interstate during a low traffic period to assure nobody gets
1053420	1057940	caught up, and trigger avalanches regularly enough that no single slide will catastrophically
1057940	1058940	bury the roadway.
1058940	1063320	But especially in a landscape like Colorado's, the priority list of road safety issues is
1063320	1066660	constantly shifting, meaning CDOT has to adapt.
1066660	1070960	In recent years, Glenwood Canyon, 80 minutes to the west, has become the interstate's
1070960	1072740	new most sensitive section.
1072740	1077020	It follows the Colorado River through a deep canyon with 1,000-foot walls, and in the event
1077020	1080540	of a closure, there is simply no viable diversion route.
1080540	1085240	What normally takes 30 minutes turns into a four-hour trek across rural two-lane roads,
1085240	1088000	effectively cutting off the entire western slope from Denver.
1088000	1093200	But in 2020, the road was shut for 13 days as a wildfire swept through the canyon, and
1093200	1095920	even that was the least of its issues.
1095920	1100360	As the fire burned the plant life whose roots kept soil in place, rainstorms cascaded into
1100360	1105100	massive mudslides that would bury the road, and potentially drivers.
1105100	1109400	Unlike avalanches, mudslides can't be remotely triggered during a managed closure, forcing
1109400	1113960	CDOT to rather close the highway whenever heavy rain was forecasted, bifurcating the
1113960	1116800	state just by the threat of weather.
1116800	1122360	With shifting threats and ever-changing demand, managing a road like I-70 is an endless job.
1122360	1127240	CDOT and its personnel constantly face new challenges to keep this crucial conduit flowing.
1127240	1131660	After all, it's a road whose existence was once thought impossible, but considering its
1131660	1136240	impossible existence has transformed the entire state's economy and human geography, its
1136240	1141740	operation is now just simply crucial.
1141740	1146180	With decades having now passed since I-70's original construction, it's due for upgrades
1146180	1150960	and plenty are happening right now thanks to funding from the $1 trillion federal infrastructure
1150960	1152840	package passed two years ago.
1152840	1156880	Now, this was something where congressional and public opinion was split evenly down party
1156880	1160820	lines, and the media coverage about the passing of the bill often framed the issue in terms
1160820	1162560	of who's winning and losing politically.
1162560	1166500	That's why I've been using our sponsor Ground News to research issues in a way that
1166500	1168640	lets me see past this partisan spin.
1168640	1172520	It's a website and app developed by a former NASA engineer on a mission to give readers
1172520	1175200	an easy, data-driven way to read the news.
1175200	1179720	Every story comes with a quick visual breakdown of the political bias, factuality, and ownership
1179720	1183640	of the source's reporting—all backed by ratings from three independent news monitoring
1183640	1184640	organizations.
1184640	1188420	And you can directly compare related articles from different sources to see what details
1188420	1190880	are emphasized or exaggerated or left out.
1190880	1194920	I especially like the Blindspot feed, which highlights stories that are disproportionately
1194920	1197200	covered by one side of the political spectrum.
1197200	1201280	Now, you may be thinking, why should I pay attention to partisan sources?
1201280	1204420	But if you lean right, you may have missed this story, and if you lean left, you may
1204420	1205420	have missed this story.
1205420	1209160	I think it's important we understand how our current media environment operates and
1209160	1213120	the impact it might have on our politics so we can engage in constructive dialogue,
1213120	1215760	and maybe we can even challenge some of our own assumptions.
