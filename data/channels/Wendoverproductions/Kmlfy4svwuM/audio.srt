1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,280
So, you want to build a road.

2
00:00:03,280 --> 00:00:06,920
First is perhaps the most impossible feat—finding a route.

3
00:00:06,920 --> 00:00:11,080
That's because roads have a particular shape that Earth often does not.

4
00:00:11,080 --> 00:00:16,280
Both linearly and laterally, they're fairly flat, but not completely flat—flat roads

5
00:00:16,280 --> 00:00:17,280
are dangerous.

6
00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:21,580
A flat turn will increase the potential of a car skidding off, so road designers slope

7
00:00:21,580 --> 00:00:25,800
the corners inward to counteract centripetal force and give the car more friction.

8
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:29,440
The higher the speed and the sharper the turn, the more slope the turn needs, meaning there

9
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:32,760
is a theoretically safest slope for a turn.

10
00:00:32,760 --> 00:00:36,700
The American Federal Highway Administration has a formula that converts design speed and

11
00:00:36,700 --> 00:00:41,400
turn radius into a suggested slope, but that's only their interpretation of it.

12
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:45,280
Road designers and mathematicians endlessly shoot academic papers back and forth debating

13
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:48,400
the merits of this and other superelevation formulas.

14
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:52,000
Some suggest more severe banking on turns to accommodate the higher centers of gravity

15
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,760
of trucks, others argue that steeper slopes are not worth the benefit due to the issues

16
00:00:55,760 --> 00:01:00,120
they create for slower-moving vehicles in the event of snow and ice, and it gets far

17
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:01,820
more complex than that.

18
00:01:01,820 --> 00:01:06,100
But this is all largely irrelevant because, at the very, very most, the sideways slope

19
00:01:06,100 --> 00:01:10,360
will be about 12%, but it's normally quite a bit less and it's only on corners, so

20
00:01:10,360 --> 00:01:14,600
overall a relatively flat cross-section is needed regardless.

21
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:19,340
Linearly, in the direction of travel, even less of a slope is tolerated.

22
00:01:19,340 --> 00:01:22,860
In order to allow heavily loaded trucks to safely climb and descend, highways should

23
00:01:22,860 --> 00:01:27,140
rise or fall no more than six vertical feet or meters for every hundred horizontal.

24
00:01:27,140 --> 00:01:32,700
So, in combination, the narrow accepted range of linear and lateral slopes presents a challenge

25
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:38,380
when you need a road to go over this—Colorado's Rocky Mountains.

26
00:01:38,380 --> 00:01:44,060
Originally, America's interstate designers didn't dare attempt to traverse these peaks.

27
00:01:44,060 --> 00:01:48,260
I-70 was originally supposed to end in Denver, leaving the state as the only in the region

28
00:01:48,260 --> 00:01:50,980
without a trans-mountain interstate.

29
00:01:50,980 --> 00:01:55,860
After intense lobbying, though, Washington relented—designers would have to find a

30
00:01:55,860 --> 00:01:57,300
route through.

31
00:01:57,300 --> 00:02:01,740
The E. Lionel Pavlo Engineering Company was tasked with identifying the cheapest, flattest

32
00:02:01,740 --> 00:02:03,300
route through the mountains.

33
00:02:03,300 --> 00:02:06,860
One year later, they returned with these seven options.

34
00:02:06,860 --> 00:02:10,460
At first glance, the northern route seemed best, as it best subscribed to one of the

35
00:02:10,460 --> 00:02:14,660
most tried and tested road routing shortcuts—rivers.

36
00:02:14,660 --> 00:02:18,620
You see, any route through the mountains is going to require a certain amount of earthwork.

37
00:02:18,660 --> 00:02:23,180
If the slope is perpendicular to the road, you cut a flat section into the slope at great

38
00:02:23,180 --> 00:02:28,300
expense—by one estimate, a 50% slope doubles construction costs.

39
00:02:28,300 --> 00:02:32,980
But using earth to achieve the required gradient in the linear direction is even more expensive,

40
00:02:32,980 --> 00:02:36,540
simply due to the sheer distance and volume of earth involved.

41
00:02:36,540 --> 00:02:40,920
So, considering they're either going to need to flatten linearly or laterally, road

42
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:43,660
builders would much rather do so laterally.

43
00:02:43,660 --> 00:02:46,500
The best place to find routes like this is by rivers.

44
00:02:46,540 --> 00:02:51,260
That's because they typically center mountain valleys and fall rather gradually—for example,

45
00:02:51,260 --> 00:02:56,540
the mighty Colorado River only drops about a mile of elevation across the 280 it traverses

46
00:02:56,540 --> 00:03:00,980
through the state, despite being surrounded by terrain steep enough for a mile of elevation

47
00:03:00,980 --> 00:03:04,300
gain to occur over a mile of horizontal distance.

48
00:03:04,300 --> 00:03:08,780
The gentle riverside linear gradient is perfect for road construction, leaving the primary

49
00:03:08,780 --> 00:03:13,180
gradient correction to the lateral direction, which can be done at lesser expense.

50
00:03:13,220 --> 00:03:18,460
Therefore, on a per-mile basis, this northern route was far cheaper and less complex—the

51
00:03:18,460 --> 00:03:22,100
only section that couldn't easily sit at a reasonable grade was here, traversing the

52
00:03:22,100 --> 00:03:24,920
Continental Divide, where they'd need to build a tunnel.

53
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:28,940
But after that, the road would follow the Fraser and Colorado Rivers, each shepherding

54
00:03:28,940 --> 00:03:31,620
a flat, mellow path through the mountains.

55
00:03:31,620 --> 00:03:36,380
But the Pavlo Engineering Company didn't ultimately suggest this route.

56
00:03:36,380 --> 00:03:41,400
Its justification was first that this northern area of Colorado was relatively sparsely populated,

57
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:44,840
even by Rocky Mountain standards, meaning this route would be of lesser use to those

58
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:47,440
actually living in the state rather than traversing.

59
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:52,120
And perhaps more crucially, even with the relatively simple geography, it was a far

60
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:54,280
longer, less direct route.

61
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:57,940
This meant that, even though the southern route would require traversing two high-elevation

62
00:03:57,940 --> 00:04:03,880
passes rather than one, Pavlo thought it could be built for some $55 million less—it would

63
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:06,320
just require some creativity.

64
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:09,560
Inevitably, this route too would require a tunnel.

65
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:13,120
That's because it crossed the Continental Divide—the geographic split between the

66
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:16,720
side of the country where rivers drain into the Atlantic and the side where they drain

67
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:18,000
into the Pacific.

68
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Inherently, rivers from one side don't connect to those on the other, meaning there generally

69
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:26,640
are not mellow mountain valleys for roads to follow up and across the Divide—there's

70
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:31,900
simply a wall of massively high, massively steep peaks, meaning traversing it was going

71
00:04:31,900 --> 00:04:36,000
to require either a massive feat of engineering to create an interstate-standard road climbing

72
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:40,800
up to nearly 12,000 feet or 3,700 meters, or the construction of the world's highest

73
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:45,280
elevation road tunnel at 11,000 feet or 3,400 meters.

74
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:50,000
Incredibly, given the gradients and weather in the area, the tunnel was ultimately selected

75
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,400
as the more practical option.

76
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:54,320
That left the other pass.

77
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:57,320
The interstate was definitely going to go through Silverthorne, and it was definitely

78
00:04:57,320 --> 00:05:01,680
going to go through Vail, but standing between the two towns was a similarly formidable stretch

79
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:02,680
of mountains.

80
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:07,200
Initially, the answer was to just go straight—climb up this valley, then tunnel under Red Buffalo

81
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:08,200
Pass.

82
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:12,180
This would require building a similarly daunting tunnel, but it would keep the highway on its

83
00:05:12,180 --> 00:05:14,720
straight, efficient route through the state.

84
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:18,760
The only issue was that the land surrounding this pass was part of the Forest Service's

85
00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:22,920
Eagle's Nest Wilderness Area—a stretch of pristine, protected nature that was not

86
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:24,920
supposed to be disturbed by anything.

87
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:30,480
This, along with the ascent of the environmental movement more broadly, led to massive public

88
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:31,480
pushback.

89
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:34,320
It was argued that it was bad enough for the highway to be disturbing the environmentally

90
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:38,700
sensitive area at all, but for it to pass through one of the highest categories of protected

91
00:05:38,700 --> 00:05:40,680
land was simply untenable.

92
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:45,780
As the official in charge of the Forest Service, the final call rested in the hands of Orville

93
00:05:45,780 --> 00:05:48,520
Freeman, the Secretary of Agriculture.

94
00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:53,280
In a shock decision, after alignment planning had already started on the Red Buffalo route,

95
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:58,020
he said no—I-70 would have to divert elsewhere.

96
00:05:58,020 --> 00:06:01,120
The alternative was clear—Vail Pass.

97
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:06,680
With its more manageable gradients and comparatively lower 10,600-foot 3,200-meter elevation, this

98
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:09,400
route could actually be navigated without a tunnel.

99
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:13,760
The downside was that the 10 miles, or 16 kilometers in added length would lead to an

100
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:18,880
estimated 94 cents in additional fuel and maintenance cost for every driver.

101
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:24,240
But at least, after years of debate, study, surveying, and consensus building, finally

102
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:28,080
Colorado's Trans Mountain Interstate had a route.

103
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:31,940
Now they just needed to turn it into reality.

104
00:06:31,940 --> 00:06:35,040
Up to this point, much of the work had been done from top down.

105
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:40,360
When it's time to build, though, this orientation flips, as road construction happens, one layer

106
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:43,120
at a time, from the bottom up.

107
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:48,640
Vail Pass is undeniably steep, but by Rocky Mountain standards, not impossibly steep.

108
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:53,000
In fact, while the section from Vail to Vail Pass reaches a grade over the preferred range

109
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:59,160
of 0-6%, the pass averages roughly a Colorado-comfortable 4.5% grade.

110
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:04,240
Linear grade, in other words, was a challenge, but the lateral would prove an even bigger

111
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:05,240
headache.

112
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:09,760
To transform undulating, unruly topography into a uniform transportation throughway,

113
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:13,880
planners start by turning in their overhead projections for a map of a different sort—a

114
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:14,880
sidecut.

115
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:18,900
Now it's time to create a path flat enough and wide enough for a road.

116
00:07:18,900 --> 00:07:22,860
This starts with building a road base which, in turn, requires the earth-moving processes

117
00:07:22,860 --> 00:07:27,380
of cutting and filling—processes straightforward enough that their name does most of the explaining,

118
00:07:27,380 --> 00:07:30,020
fill earth where it's needed, and cut away where it isn't.

119
00:07:30,020 --> 00:07:34,140
At its simplest, cutting and filling begins first with surveying in the field, then with

120
00:07:34,140 --> 00:07:38,420
measurements made, moves to paper, becoming an exercise in rudimentary math.

121
00:07:38,420 --> 00:07:43,820
First, the proposed route is broken into 100-foot or 30-meter sections called stations, then,

122
00:07:43,820 --> 00:07:47,820
at each station or half-station, planners look at the sidecut and figure out where dirt

123
00:07:47,820 --> 00:07:50,300
needs to be added and where it needs to be removed.

124
00:07:50,740 --> 00:07:54,860
If a road's going into a hillside, for instance, the cut will be on the uphill side, the fill

125
00:07:54,860 --> 00:07:58,500
on the downhill side, with the earth from the cut being moved to the fill.

126
00:07:58,500 --> 00:08:02,020
On flat land, there's likely to be more fill than cut as a road will be positioned

127
00:08:02,020 --> 00:08:05,660
to sit higher than its surroundings so water will shed off the road's shoulder rather

128
00:08:05,660 --> 00:08:06,660
than pool.

129
00:08:06,660 --> 00:08:09,860
Once the amount of earth required to move is figured out at one particular station,

130
00:08:09,860 --> 00:08:14,940
it's on to the next station to do the same math, then the next, then the next after that.

131
00:08:14,940 --> 00:08:18,400
And once all these values are figured out, the planar now has a rough sense as to how

132
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:22,180
much earth will need to be moved, and how much time, material, and money it will cost

133
00:08:22,180 --> 00:08:24,800
across the entire length of the roadway.

134
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:29,280
According to a Florida Department of Transportation cost-estimating model, this part of the process—cutting

135
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:33,260
and filling or excavating and embanking for a divided four-lane highway across a rural

136
00:08:33,260 --> 00:08:38,360
landscape would cost in itself over $1 million a mile, which makes up nearly a quarter of

137
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:39,560
the per-mile price.

138
00:08:39,560 --> 00:08:43,820
Though a task that's easy to wrap one's head around, it's one that requires a fundamental

139
00:08:43,820 --> 00:08:47,460
reshaping of a landscape, and thus, a lot of money.

140
00:08:47,460 --> 00:08:51,860
And this estimates for the flat state of Florida, not Colorado, a state where protruding peaks

141
00:08:51,860 --> 00:08:57,420
and a rocky disposition make it easy for earth-moving costs to shoot a mile high.

142
00:08:57,420 --> 00:09:02,980
Before I-70 crested over Vail Pass, it was US Highway 6, a small two-lane road cut into

143
00:09:02,980 --> 00:09:07,640
the north side of the canyon that was notorious for its sharp turns and difficult driving.

144
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:11,780
It was dangerous to the point that motorists often avoided it, opting for the smoother,

145
00:09:11,780 --> 00:09:14,900
safer, but exceptionally indirect US 40.

146
00:09:14,900 --> 00:09:19,020
To build a bigger road, effectively two US 6s, while making the road safe enough to move

147
00:09:19,020 --> 00:09:25,060
unfamiliar Americans across at a 60-mile-per-hour clip, there would need to be a lot more earthwork.

148
00:09:25,060 --> 00:09:29,480
But in such a tight space, and such a pristine and delicate environment, there would also

149
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:30,940
be major constraints.

150
00:09:30,940 --> 00:09:33,620
The first was this tiny creek.

151
00:09:33,620 --> 00:09:39,240
While a waterway that only a fraction of Coloradans can actually name, Blackgore Creek was and

152
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:43,660
is critical to the communities below, filling the recreational reservoirs near the pass,

153
00:09:43,660 --> 00:09:47,020
applying drinking water to Vail, and eventually dedicating its flow to a section of creek

154
00:09:47,020 --> 00:09:50,700
below the town of Vail that's earned the distinction as a gold-metal water for trout

155
00:09:50,700 --> 00:09:51,700
fishing.

156
00:09:51,700 --> 00:09:55,620
Blackgore Creek is important—locals knew as much and federal planners knew as much—so

157
00:09:55,620 --> 00:09:59,780
when it came to figure out where to flatten out enough space for a road base, the question

158
00:09:59,780 --> 00:10:03,860
of what it would do to the watershed became an important one.

159
00:10:03,860 --> 00:10:06,200
Runoff is a tricky business in road building.

160
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:10,380
It first presents a challenge during construction, but handled improperly will remain a challenge

161
00:10:10,380 --> 00:10:12,220
for the lifespan of a road.

162
00:10:12,220 --> 00:10:16,580
On Vail Pass, this challenge was exacerbated by perpetually sandy soils, rapid snowmelt

163
00:10:16,580 --> 00:10:19,780
in late spring, and pounding rainfall in mid-summer.

164
00:10:19,780 --> 00:10:24,200
With the passage of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1970, I-70 contractors were

165
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:28,020
just beginning to understand environmental impact statements and pollution laws when

166
00:10:28,020 --> 00:10:31,140
they were awarded contracts to get the interstate over the mountain.

167
00:10:31,140 --> 00:10:36,880
Now, rather than just being fast, they had to be diligent too, or face the fines.

168
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:40,980
City officials downstream from the project, for their part, were concerned about construction,

169
00:10:40,980 --> 00:10:44,660
as the loose soil at the pass was already silting up the town's water supply before

170
00:10:44,660 --> 00:10:48,140
any construction tore out grass and vegetation upslope.

171
00:10:48,140 --> 00:10:52,940
So contractors, as they do today, meticulously tested the water to ensure that sediment hadn't

172
00:10:52,940 --> 00:10:55,540
risen to unacceptable levels under their watch.

173
00:10:55,540 --> 00:10:59,700
To keep these levels low during construction, teams placed hay bales and sandbags to slow

174
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:02,380
runoff and direct it to settlement basins.

175
00:11:02,380 --> 00:11:05,980
Water would inevitably make it to the stream, but if they slowed it and let the particles

176
00:11:05,980 --> 00:11:09,820
settle to the bottom, it wouldn't carry too much dirt down with it.

177
00:11:09,820 --> 00:11:12,580
But these are temporary problems with temporary fixes.

178
00:11:12,580 --> 00:11:16,100
There's also the challenge of dealing with water once a road's complete, and this is

179
00:11:16,100 --> 00:11:20,520
such a critical concern of road building that the US Department of Transportation Project

180
00:11:20,520 --> 00:11:25,340
Development and Design Manual dedicates an entire chapter to the subject of water.

181
00:11:25,340 --> 00:11:29,580
Basically, the question this entire chapter revolves around is how to best move water

182
00:11:29,580 --> 00:11:33,980
around and off roadways without ruining the nearby surroundings.

183
00:11:33,980 --> 00:11:37,860
The answer begins above the cut and starts during the construction phase.

184
00:11:37,900 --> 00:11:41,980
The very moment a road base is established, it's a race to revegetate the slope above

185
00:11:41,980 --> 00:11:46,220
the road with grasses and shrubbery that will hold the land in place when it rains.

186
00:11:46,220 --> 00:11:50,700
Generally, planners look to keep the uphill slope no steeper than a ratio of 2 to 1.

187
00:11:50,700 --> 00:11:55,420
For every two units the slope extends horizontally, it may safely rise one.

188
00:11:55,420 --> 00:12:00,380
With a harsher environment, Vail Pass planners opted for slopes of 2.5 to 1 or less and to

189
00:12:00,380 --> 00:12:04,340
give grasses their best chance, sprayed hillsides with mulch on the steepest sections, and placed

190
00:12:04,340 --> 00:12:06,460
netting to help the seed take hold.

191
00:12:06,460 --> 00:12:10,780
For natural depressions that served as drainages for the hillsides, teams placed thirsty willows

192
00:12:10,780 --> 00:12:14,500
and boulders to both naturalize the landscape and slow the flow.

193
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:19,120
On Vail Pass, and generally in highway construction, builders will make the most of these perpendicular

194
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:23,160
drainages and actually cut uphill ditches running parallel with the road to divert runoff

195
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:26,700
headed for highway to the drainage, then below via culvert.

196
00:12:26,700 --> 00:12:30,960
Where applicable, paralleling ditches, culverts, and revegetation have proved tried and true

197
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:35,680
techniques to manage runoff and mitigate erosion in Colorado and elsewhere, but in the narrow

198
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:41,780
confines below the pass, neither simple cut-and-fills nor their drainage systems were always applicable.

199
00:12:41,780 --> 00:12:45,620
To ensure that road fill wouldn't spill into Black Gore or Ten Mile Creek, planners

200
00:12:45,620 --> 00:12:48,220
instead opted for retaining walls.

201
00:12:48,220 --> 00:12:52,940
Where rock formations made a smooth 2 to 1 cut impossible, explosives blasted shear walls

202
00:12:52,940 --> 00:12:57,160
out of troublesome rock formations while netting and planted topsoil placed above mitigated

203
00:12:57,160 --> 00:12:58,480
future rockfall.

204
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:01,960
And most unique to this particular section of Interstate are the sections neither blown

205
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:06,100
into the rock nor cut into the mountainside, but the 23 separate sections of the interstate

206
00:13:06,100 --> 00:13:10,180
that float across the landscape on bridges that were placed to account for the fact that

207
00:13:10,180 --> 00:13:15,180
almost the entire road from Vail to the pass sits on a fault line and a series of still-shifting

208
00:13:15,180 --> 00:13:16,820
historical landslides.

209
00:13:16,820 --> 00:13:21,520
With the cuts and fills, the exposed rock cuts, and the bridges, this section of roadway

210
00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:26,360
is practically a highway-building handbook on its own, and as an exemplary road of nearly

211
00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:30,900
every trick and technique available to road engineers, it wasn't cheap.

212
00:13:30,900 --> 00:13:36,680
When Vail Pass was proudly dedicated in 1978, estimates put the cost of the 24-mile, 39-kilometer

213
00:13:36,680 --> 00:13:43,960
section at an estimated $91 million—adjusted for inflation, that's nearly $427 million

214
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:49,080
total, $18 million per mile, or $11 million per kilometer.

215
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:53,380
And yet, with all that money spent, driving over Vail Pass doesn't feel as if you're

216
00:13:53,380 --> 00:13:56,780
passing over an engineering marvel that's conquered a landscape, but rather a road that

217
00:13:56,780 --> 00:13:58,960
almost seems a part of it.

218
00:13:58,960 --> 00:14:02,620
With a delicate landscape front of mind, while crossing Forest Service land and connecting

219
00:14:02,620 --> 00:14:07,100
ski resorts and a host of other recreation hotspots, every last detail along the pass,

220
00:14:07,100 --> 00:14:11,300
from the red-tinged concrete to match the local rock, boulders strewn across revegetation

221
00:14:11,300 --> 00:14:15,180
areas, and Frank Lloyd Wright-inspired retaining walls to the manner in which rock was blasted

222
00:14:15,180 --> 00:14:18,880
to make it look more natural, this section of interstate was built to fit the landscape

223
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:23,140
and the values of the area around it—something that's not lost on contemporary planners

224
00:14:23,140 --> 00:14:27,720
who have carefully codified these specific design traits for future additions or alterations

225
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:28,780
on the pass.

226
00:14:28,780 --> 00:14:32,480
In this way, though, I-70's the same as any other road—designed uniquely to fit

227
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:36,440
its environment and best serve a particular purpose.

228
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:39,860
But even once designed and built for that environment, the environment is constantly

229
00:14:39,860 --> 00:14:45,080
shifting which means that roads, especially those as complex as I-70, need constant management

230
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:46,940
in order to stay safe.

231
00:14:46,940 --> 00:14:51,400
With its tight turns, steep gradients, and volatile weather, the entirety of this road

232
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:55,160
is treacherous, but with their inherently limited resources, the Colorado Department

233
00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:59,200
of Transportation focuses its efforts most on the sections that are most dangerous and

234
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:01,580
most disruptive to close down.

235
00:15:01,580 --> 00:15:06,740
Eisenhower Tunnel, that highest road tunnel in the US, is one such spot.

236
00:15:06,740 --> 00:15:10,580
Even under the best conditions, the slower speeds of the tunnel turn it into a chokepoint

237
00:15:10,580 --> 00:15:13,860
that causes massive, notorious traffic backlogs.

238
00:15:13,860 --> 00:15:18,660
If the tunnel closes, an entire interstate's worth of traffic must divert onto the winding,

239
00:15:18,660 --> 00:15:24,160
treacherous two-lane Loveland Pass which turns a bad traffic situation catastrophic.

240
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:26,180
But there simply are not alternatives.

241
00:15:26,180 --> 00:15:30,620
The next shortest diversion is two hours long over another treacherous mountain pass, so

242
00:15:30,620 --> 00:15:35,300
CDOT does everything possible to keep Eisenhower Tunnel open.

243
00:15:35,300 --> 00:15:37,860
This starts with some controversial rules.

244
00:15:37,860 --> 00:15:42,940
Hazmat trucks, carrying fuel, chemicals, or other hazardous materials, are not allowed

245
00:15:42,940 --> 00:15:43,940
through the tunnel.

246
00:15:43,940 --> 00:15:48,580
The logic is that a fuel tanker fire, for instance, would be absolutely catastrophic

247
00:15:48,580 --> 00:15:50,140
in such an enclosed space.

248
00:15:50,140 --> 00:15:54,020
While the tunnel does have its own fire department that can handle smaller incidents, it's

249
00:15:54,020 --> 00:15:58,420
no location means that getting full resources to combat such a hazmat incident could take

250
00:15:58,420 --> 00:16:02,960
hours, in which time the tunnel could be damaged to an extent that could take months or years

251
00:16:02,960 --> 00:16:06,760
to fix, let alone the risks to any drivers trapped inside.

252
00:16:06,760 --> 00:16:11,440
What this means is that hazmat trucks must take the treacherous Loveland Pass instead,

253
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:17,520
which CDOT plows up to its near 12,000-foot, 3,700-meter peak all through the winter, making

254
00:16:17,520 --> 00:16:20,560
it Colorado's highest year-round road.

255
00:16:20,580 --> 00:16:24,860
Of course, navigating a fuel tanker up a steep, winding road to 12,000 feet in the middle

256
00:16:24,860 --> 00:16:29,280
of a Colorado winter is far from safe, so trucking industry advocates argue that this

257
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:34,060
policy is effectively trading the safety of truck drivers for the convenience of ski commuters,

258
00:16:34,060 --> 00:16:38,380
but after a recent feasibility study reevaluating the policy, CDOT maintains that it's the

259
00:16:38,380 --> 00:16:41,380
best balance of safety overall.

260
00:16:41,380 --> 00:16:45,020
But even I-70 itself is plenty treacherous in the winter.

261
00:16:45,020 --> 00:16:49,500
After all, this is the highest elevation section of interstate in the US.

262
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:53,520
In their proximity to the Continental Divide, both sides of the tunnel are flanked by steep

263
00:16:53,520 --> 00:16:58,300
mountain faces, and with steep mountain faces come avalanches.

264
00:16:58,300 --> 00:17:02,960
This is Mount Bethel, and these two tree-free corridors are the telltale signs of an avalanche

265
00:17:02,960 --> 00:17:03,960
path.

266
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:07,480
If an avalanche were to trigger without warning, the snow and debris could bury the roadway

267
00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:11,880
for hours or even days, and potentially even bury people.

268
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:14,880
Therefore, CDOT triggers avalanches themselves.

269
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:19,480
At the start of each winter, the department positions Obelix trigger devices at the top

270
00:17:19,480 --> 00:17:22,060
of slide paths on each side of the tunnel.

271
00:17:22,060 --> 00:17:26,220
These remotely triggered egg-shaped capsules shoot out a concussive blast from the bottom

272
00:17:26,220 --> 00:17:29,660
that, if the conditions are right, trigger an avalanche in the snow below.

273
00:17:29,660 --> 00:17:33,420
This allows CDOT to close the interstate during a low traffic period to assure nobody gets

274
00:17:33,420 --> 00:17:37,940
caught up, and trigger avalanches regularly enough that no single slide will catastrophically

275
00:17:37,940 --> 00:17:38,940
bury the roadway.

276
00:17:38,940 --> 00:17:43,320
But especially in a landscape like Colorado's, the priority list of road safety issues is

277
00:17:43,320 --> 00:17:46,660
constantly shifting, meaning CDOT has to adapt.

278
00:17:46,660 --> 00:17:50,960
In recent years, Glenwood Canyon, 80 minutes to the west, has become the interstate's

279
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:52,740
new most sensitive section.

280
00:17:52,740 --> 00:17:57,020
It follows the Colorado River through a deep canyon with 1,000-foot walls, and in the event

281
00:17:57,020 --> 00:18:00,540
of a closure, there is simply no viable diversion route.

282
00:18:00,540 --> 00:18:05,240
What normally takes 30 minutes turns into a four-hour trek across rural two-lane roads,

283
00:18:05,240 --> 00:18:08,000
effectively cutting off the entire western slope from Denver.

284
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:13,200
But in 2020, the road was shut for 13 days as a wildfire swept through the canyon, and

285
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:15,920
even that was the least of its issues.

286
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:20,360
As the fire burned the plant life whose roots kept soil in place, rainstorms cascaded into

287
00:18:20,360 --> 00:18:25,100
massive mudslides that would bury the road, and potentially drivers.

288
00:18:25,100 --> 00:18:29,400
Unlike avalanches, mudslides can't be remotely triggered during a managed closure, forcing

289
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:33,960
CDOT to rather close the highway whenever heavy rain was forecasted, bifurcating the

290
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:36,800
state just by the threat of weather.

291
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:42,360
With shifting threats and ever-changing demand, managing a road like I-70 is an endless job.

292
00:18:42,360 --> 00:18:47,240
CDOT and its personnel constantly face new challenges to keep this crucial conduit flowing.

293
00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:51,660
After all, it's a road whose existence was once thought impossible, but considering its

294
00:18:51,660 --> 00:18:56,240
impossible existence has transformed the entire state's economy and human geography, its

295
00:18:56,240 --> 00:19:01,740
operation is now just simply crucial.

296
00:19:01,740 --> 00:19:06,180
With decades having now passed since I-70's original construction, it's due for upgrades

297
00:19:06,180 --> 00:19:10,960
and plenty are happening right now thanks to funding from the $1 trillion federal infrastructure

298
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:12,840
package passed two years ago.

299
00:19:12,840 --> 00:19:16,880
Now, this was something where congressional and public opinion was split evenly down party

300
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:20,820
lines, and the media coverage about the passing of the bill often framed the issue in terms

301
00:19:20,820 --> 00:19:22,560
of who's winning and losing politically.

302
00:19:22,560 --> 00:19:26,500
That's why I've been using our sponsor Ground News to research issues in a way that

303
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:28,640
lets me see past this partisan spin.

304
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:32,520
It's a website and app developed by a former NASA engineer on a mission to give readers

305
00:19:32,520 --> 00:19:35,200
an easy, data-driven way to read the news.

306
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:39,720
Every story comes with a quick visual breakdown of the political bias, factuality, and ownership

307
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:43,640
of the source's reporting—all backed by ratings from three independent news monitoring

308
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:44,640
organizations.

309
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:48,420
And you can directly compare related articles from different sources to see what details

310
00:19:48,420 --> 00:19:50,880
are emphasized or exaggerated or left out.

311
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:54,920
I especially like the Blindspot feed, which highlights stories that are disproportionately

312
00:19:54,920 --> 00:19:57,200
covered by one side of the political spectrum.

313
00:19:57,200 --> 00:20:01,280
Now, you may be thinking, why should I pay attention to partisan sources?

314
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:04,420
But if you lean right, you may have missed this story, and if you lean left, you may

315
00:20:04,420 --> 00:20:05,420
have missed this story.

316
00:20:05,420 --> 00:20:09,160
I think it's important we understand how our current media environment operates and

317
00:20:09,160 --> 00:20:13,120
the impact it might have on our politics so we can engage in constructive dialogue,
