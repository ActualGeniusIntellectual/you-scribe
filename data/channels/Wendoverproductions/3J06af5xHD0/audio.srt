1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,940
The documentary you're about to watch is a Nebula original—that means it was funded

2
00:00:04,940 --> 00:00:08,580
by and released on the streaming platform Nebula first.

3
00:00:08,580 --> 00:00:12,700
We thought, though, that this one in particular would be important to get out to the widest

4
00:00:12,700 --> 00:00:16,260
audience possible given how important the subject matter is.

5
00:00:16,260 --> 00:00:20,860
It is, though, going to be one of the last Nebula originals uploaded to YouTube as we're

6
00:00:20,860 --> 00:00:21,860
phasing that out.

7
00:00:21,860 --> 00:00:26,340
I hope this serves as evidence for you on just how high-quality the content on Nebula

8
00:00:26,340 --> 00:00:32,480
is, and, each week, new originals come out from some of the top educational content creators.

9
00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:36,820
If you want to see more, Nebula is available through a bundle deal with CuriosityStream

10
00:00:36,820 --> 00:00:41,860
for just $15 a year at their current sale pricing, and that's available only by going

11
00:00:41,860 --> 00:00:45,580
to CuriosityStream.com slash Wendover.

12
00:00:45,580 --> 00:00:47,560
Now to the Marshall Islands.

13
00:00:56,340 --> 00:01:21,820
The legend in Marshall's eyes is that the Marshall Islands were created by a cart.

14
00:01:21,820 --> 00:01:23,380
His name was Lawa.

15
00:01:23,380 --> 00:01:31,540
He descended on the atoll of island Lawa, and he created the islands by saying Lawa

16
00:01:31,540 --> 00:01:37,660
and islands, and they were islands, Lawa and people, and they were people, Lawa and fish,

17
00:01:37,660 --> 00:01:42,060
and they were fish, and on and on like that.

18
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:48,780
Our lands, you know, like our mothers, you know, they provide for everything, and our

19
00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:49,780
oceans, same thing.

20
00:01:49,780 --> 00:01:55,660
We've always thought about the ocean as our friends, but now it's becoming a threat

21
00:01:55,660 --> 00:01:58,860
to us.

22
00:01:58,860 --> 00:02:04,260
You know when you find a globe, and you give it a whirl, and it goes around and around

23
00:02:04,260 --> 00:02:09,180
and around, and then as the going slows, your eyes come to a rest on a dash of color that

24
00:02:09,180 --> 00:02:13,900
has never caught your attention before—a spot that sits on the part of the sphere you

25
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:16,400
normally spin right past.

26
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:21,920
An island so isolated that you're not even sure how you'd explain where it is—somewhere

27
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:27,560
whose story is seen as insignificant, a land that's lost to most of the world, left out

28
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:31,320
of the history books apart from a passing mention.

29
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:36,280
That place is here—the Republic of the Marshall Islands.

30
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:39,980
But unknown, untold, unremembered places aren't unique.

31
00:02:39,980 --> 00:02:44,760
What makes the Marshall Islands story singular is not that it's unrecognized from above,

32
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:49,240
but because it's under siege, from below, and it's only when you see it from the middle

33
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:51,880
that you can understand why.

34
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:56,360
Go on, take a look, you won't have the chance for long.

35
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:59,840
We can talk more about the end of their world later, but first I've got to tell you about

36
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:00,840
what we've got here.

37
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:05,240
It's a small nation, the Marshall Islands, with a bit over 50,000 residents and 70 square

38
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:11,000
miles of land, split up into 29 atolls—thin rings of land encircling saltwater lagoons.

39
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:15,860
While significant populations can be found on 13 of those atolls, over half of the Marshallese

40
00:03:15,860 --> 00:03:19,180
people can be found on this one, Majuro.

41
00:03:19,180 --> 00:03:25,040
About 28,000 people live on the capital atoll, and none of those 28,000 live more than a

42
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:27,160
few minutes' walk from the ocean.

43
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:32,080
The furthest you can get from the water is about 2,000 feet or 600 meters inland, but

44
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:37,440
that's an anomaly—in most spots, water flanks you closely on both sides.

45
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:42,480
In some spots, the atoll gets so thin that you could stand in the lagoon and have a conversation

46
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:45,280
with someone standing in the ocean.

47
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:51,320
Life on a remote, sunny coral atoll may sound idyllic, but the population density of Majuro,

48
00:03:51,320 --> 00:03:56,840
greater than that of Bahrain, Bermuda, or Bangladesh, has not been kind to the mother

49
00:03:56,840 --> 00:03:57,840
atoll.

50
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:02,120
In a part of the world usually thought of as pristine, sparse, and pastoral, Majuro

51
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:05,400
is instead gritty, overcrowded, and urbanized.

52
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:09,520
But it's far from an island paradise.

53
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:14,840
Based on the 2011 census, which was the last census we had, average household size on Majuro

54
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:21,520
was about seven people, and household income is probably about $16,000 in that neighborhood.

55
00:04:21,520 --> 00:04:30,120
Well, I mean, $16,000 divided by seven, you know, it can be, that can be a challenge,

56
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:31,120
that can be tough.

57
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:32,800
Here's the problem.

58
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:36,800
Some places are poor because they haven't yet seized their opportunity.

59
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:40,120
Others are poor because they have no opportunity.

60
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:43,600
Majuro is in that second category.

61
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:47,840
Characteristics of the economy here in the islands is, you know, you're looking at

62
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:50,040
fish, coconuts, people.

63
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:54,920
I mean, outside of that, our natural resources are fairly scarce.

64
00:04:54,920 --> 00:05:00,720
And then combined with our challenges with education and skills attainment makes it even

65
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:05,200
more challenging with people being our third largest natural resource.

66
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:11,760
Those are some major inhibitors for, you know, sustaining economic growth, expanding the

67
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:13,940
economy here in the islands.

68
00:05:13,940 --> 00:05:17,880
Like many small island nations, the Marshall Islands doesn't have too much in the way

69
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:22,360
of natural resources worth exporting, and even when it does manage to produce something

70
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:26,840
people might want to buy, the cost of shipping it to those potential buyers will have pumped

71
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:30,580
up the price so much that it's no longer worth it.

72
00:05:30,580 --> 00:05:34,880
One of the very few things they make decent business of selling abroad is copra, or dried

73
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:39,100
coconut meat, which is produced mainly on outer atolls and then brought into Majuro

74
00:05:39,100 --> 00:05:40,100
for processing.

75
00:05:40,100 --> 00:05:44,840
It's a work-intensive process mostly conducted by families who form informal assembly lines

76
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:49,620
getting paid 50 cents a pound, and even that low wage is the result of heavy government

77
00:05:49,620 --> 00:05:51,600
subsidies.

78
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:56,120
Because creating viable export goods is so difficult, most of the jobs in the Marshall

79
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:59,060
Islands are either in government or the subsistence economy.

80
00:05:59,060 --> 00:06:03,100
In other words, most people in the Marshall Islands are providing services or making goods

81
00:06:03,100 --> 00:06:08,340
exclusively for the Marshall Islands, which leaves very little opportunity for growth.

82
00:06:08,340 --> 00:06:14,060
But the country does have one tiny little asset that keeps it running—its location.

83
00:06:14,060 --> 00:06:18,300
A location that makes the Marshall Islands attractive to one of the world's biggest

84
00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:22,020
businesses—the US military.

85
00:06:22,020 --> 00:06:26,340
The American military presence can be found mainly on Kwajalein Atoll, which serves as

86
00:06:26,340 --> 00:06:31,060
a key test site for the US ballistic missile defense system, among other purposes.

87
00:06:31,060 --> 00:06:35,340
In the end, it's simple logic—the US military wants access to the Marshall Islands, the

88
00:06:35,340 --> 00:06:40,540
Marshall Islands wants money and security, and thus, an agreement exists—the Compact

89
00:06:40,540 --> 00:06:41,540
of Free Association.

90
00:06:41,540 --> 00:06:48,300
So, the Compact of Free Association basically lays the foundation for the relationship between

91
00:06:48,300 --> 00:06:52,340
the United States and the freely associated states.

92
00:06:52,340 --> 00:06:57,680
One section of the Compact deals with the relationship between our peoples, and it allows

93
00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:05,780
for qualified citizens to live and work and study in the United States without a visa.

94
00:07:05,780 --> 00:07:10,740
There's another section of the Compact that generally governs economics, and it provides

95
00:07:10,740 --> 00:07:18,220
for grants and services, all kinds of USG assistance coming to the Marshall Islands.

96
00:07:18,220 --> 00:07:22,980
The third big section of the Compact has to do with security provisions.

97
00:07:22,980 --> 00:07:26,460
The United States is the guarantor of security in the Marshall Islands.

98
00:07:26,460 --> 00:07:29,820
It's difficult to overstate the significance of the Compact.

99
00:07:29,820 --> 00:07:34,780
It's the basis of the entire modern economic and political system of the Marshals, and

100
00:07:34,780 --> 00:07:39,420
while each of the three sections has an enormous impact on the country, perhaps none is more

101
00:07:39,420 --> 00:07:43,640
consequential than the second—financial aid.

102
00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:51,960
The Marshals are heavily dependent on money from donors or from the United States.

103
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:58,980
That's a tremendous part of the national income—upward 70-80%.

104
00:07:58,980 --> 00:08:04,240
The US provides approximately $100 million every year to the RMI as a combination of

105
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:06,240
grants and services and programs.

106
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:11,360
Now, it's a big world out there, and there are quite a few places the US could send $100

107
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:14,320
million a year in exchange for military access.

108
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:15,420
So why here?

109
00:08:15,420 --> 00:08:19,760
Why is there this strange partnership between one of the world's largest superpowers and

110
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:22,120
one of the world's smallest countries?

111
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:27,440
Well, like most strange things, it came as a result of millions of years of chance and

112
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:28,960
circumstance.

113
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:34,580
About 70 million years ago, 29 ancient volcanoes in what we now call the North Pacific came

114
00:08:34,580 --> 00:08:39,760
to life and spewed out lava which quickly cooled and built up into under-ocean volcanic

115
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:45,680
structures until they grew so much that they emerged above water and became islands.

116
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:49,520
Around these islands, coral began to form, eventually coalescing into what's known

117
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:53,700
as a fringing coral reef, which encircled each island.

118
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:58,000
Time went on, the dinosaurs ruled and then died or became birds, and mammals started

119
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:02,600
mattering and so on and so on, and as that all happened, those islands were slowly eroding

120
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:06,400
and undergoing subsidence—they slowly sunk into the sea.

121
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:10,160
Eventually, the islands disappeared under the ocean, but the coral reefs that had formed

122
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:12,360
around them remained.

123
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:17,680
It is these 29 rings of coral, called atolls, that make up what's now known as the Marshall

124
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:18,680
Islands.

125
00:09:18,680 --> 00:09:23,000
Sometime, millions of years later, but 4,000 years before today, the first Marshallese

126
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:27,740
settlers arrived on the islands, coming from either here, here, here, or here, or some

127
00:09:27,740 --> 00:09:29,560
combination of those places.

128
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:34,180
They split the atolls into two chains—the eastern relic, or sunrise chain, and the western

129
00:09:34,180 --> 00:09:35,980
rata, or sunset chain.

130
00:09:35,980 --> 00:09:40,220
From those early Marshallese, eight clans emerged, of which four became dominant.

131
00:09:40,220 --> 00:09:44,300
The Chiti conquered northern Ralic, the Arab Rajoy took southern Ralic, and the Rumiore

132
00:09:44,300 --> 00:09:48,220
clan conquered nearly all of Ratak, but then gave nearly all of it to their offspring,

133
00:09:48,220 --> 00:09:49,660
of the Rano clan.

134
00:09:49,660 --> 00:09:54,180
These early Marshallese wore traditional clothing, which looked like this, lived in large community-based

135
00:09:54,180 --> 00:09:58,180
homes, which looked like this, and practiced a religion that involved complex dances and

136
00:09:58,180 --> 00:10:00,800
tattoos, which looked like this.

137
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:04,740
The first western explorers to find the Marshall Islands were Spaniards, and there were a few

138
00:10:04,740 --> 00:10:05,740
of them.

139
00:10:05,740 --> 00:10:11,900
The first one was this guy in 1526, then this guy in 1529, and then this guy in 1530.

140
00:10:11,900 --> 00:10:16,580
Over the next 300 years, more explorers stopped through the Marshalls, including Frenchmen,

141
00:10:16,580 --> 00:10:21,660
Russians, and this guy, British captain John Charles Marshall in 1788, after whom the islands

142
00:10:21,660 --> 00:10:23,620
were named on western maps.

143
00:10:23,620 --> 00:10:27,660
Technically, during this time, the Spanish claimed sovereignty over the Marshall Islands

144
00:10:27,660 --> 00:10:32,060
as part of the Spanish East Indies, which included all of this, but that claim was largely

145
00:10:32,060 --> 00:10:33,640
just theoretical.

146
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:38,200
The Spanish never had a formal administration, never tried to exert influence, and never

147
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:42,340
really even visited apart from those early explorers, whose only real impact had been

148
00:10:42,340 --> 00:10:45,380
giving the Marshallese European diseases.

149
00:10:45,380 --> 00:10:49,880
Much more relevant to the actual history of the Marshalls was the presence of these people,

150
00:10:49,880 --> 00:10:54,280
Boston missionaries who first arrived in 1857 aboard the Morning Star.

151
00:10:54,280 --> 00:11:00,320
They landed here, on Ebon Atoll, and were met by Chief Kabua, whose great-great-some-number-of-greats

152
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:04,560
grandson was the first president of the Marshall Islands, and whose some-greater-number-of-greats

153
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:06,840
grandson is the current president.

154
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:10,540
Chief Kabua allowed the missionaries to stay there, where they began spreading Christianity

155
00:11:10,540 --> 00:11:12,040
throughout the islands.

156
00:11:12,040 --> 00:11:15,960
Not only were they teaching them about this guy in this book, they also actively changed

157
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:20,140
Marshallese culture, even going so far as to ban traditional tattooing and dancing because

158
00:11:20,140 --> 00:11:23,240
they referenced the traditional Marshallese religion.

159
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:28,120
Soon, the Marshall Islands changed even more as the first genuine western settlers, the

160
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:31,460
Germans, began to make residence in the islands.

161
00:11:31,460 --> 00:11:35,720
In 1875, they signed a treaty of friendship with Chief Kabua, and developed a consulate,

162
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:40,160
trading posts, and economic ties, eventually buying the Marshalls from Spain in 1885, the

163
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:43,480
same year they worked with Chief Kabua to make the Marshall Islands an official German

164
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:44,480
protectorate.

165
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:49,860
Also, importantly, they brought in more missionaries who spread even more Christianity.

166
00:11:49,860 --> 00:11:55,240
But then, in 1914, the Germans decided to invade here, which led to here invading here,

167
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:58,920
and then here invading here, and then here invading here, and then here invading here,

168
00:11:58,920 --> 00:12:03,560
and also, not that many people paid attention to it, the Japanese invading here—the Marshall

169
00:12:03,560 --> 00:12:05,240
Islands.

170
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:10,420
Japan took the Marshalls in part for strategic reasons, in part for economic reasons.

171
00:12:10,420 --> 00:12:16,000
After all, even in the final years of German rule, they controlled over 80% of the island's

172
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,000
trade.

173
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:20,780
Once World War I ended and all these people got together to sign the Treaty of Versailles,

174
00:12:20,780 --> 00:12:25,040
the Council of the League of Nations gave control of the Marshall Islands to the Japanese.

175
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:29,600
While in power, they expanded their administration, introduced Japanese culture, and moved about

176
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:31,920
1,000 Japanese citizens to the islands.

177
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:36,880
But then, because of some things going on here and here and also here, the Japanese

178
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:41,040
decided to drop bombs here, which led to the United States entering World War II and eventually

179
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:44,640
taking the Marshalls from the Japanese in 1944.

180
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:46,640
And then came this.

181
00:12:55,040 --> 00:13:04,860
When the United States dropped atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, it began a new

182
00:13:04,860 --> 00:13:09,600
chapter in the world's history—the nuclear age.

183
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:14,080
These atomic footprints on the sands of time can never be erased.

184
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:21,120
They point a path which leads to unparalleled progress, or unparalleled destruction.

185
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:27,280
Just as in the darkness of the desert morning, when the atomic age was born, atomic power

186
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:37,720
puts the question squarely to mankind.

187
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:39,160
For some, it was exciting.

188
00:13:39,160 --> 00:13:43,660
There were mushroom cloud cakes, misatomic beauty pageants, and talk of unlimited clean

189
00:13:43,660 --> 00:13:48,200
energy, unparalleled military dominance, and an everlasting world peace.

190
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:59,280
But of course, the enduring legacy of nuclear weapons is not peace or energy, but destruction.

191
00:13:59,280 --> 00:14:03,560
And while what happened in Hiroshima and Nagasaki can be found in any book of modern history,

192
00:14:03,560 --> 00:14:09,640
there's another chapter of the nuclear story that's told far less often—that of the

193
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:11,360
Marshall Islands.

194
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:17,760
So what happened at the end of World War II was, there had already been three nuclear

195
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:23,100
weapons detonated—one in New Mexico and then Hiroshima and Nagasaki.

196
00:14:23,100 --> 00:14:28,460
But the United States at that time—not just the United States, the Russians too—they

197
00:14:28,460 --> 00:14:34,360
wanted to increase their knowledge about the nuclear testing.

198
00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:38,860
And so they needed a testing ground, and when they looked around the globe, they needed

199
00:14:38,860 --> 00:14:44,060
several requirements for a proving ground for their nuclear testing.

200
00:14:44,060 --> 00:14:48,820
Had to be out of the way of major airline and shipping routes, had to be under the control

201
00:14:48,820 --> 00:14:57,140
of the United States, had to have a really wide area, a lagoon, to anchor the ships to

202
00:14:57,140 --> 00:14:59,780
do the testing with—somewhere really far out of the way.

203
00:14:59,780 --> 00:15:03,620
They looked around the map and they saw Bikini.

204
00:15:03,620 --> 00:15:08,420
Bikini Atoll sits at the northern end of the relic chain—2.3 square miles of land encircling

205
00:15:08,460 --> 00:15:10,980
a 229 square mile lagoon.

206
00:15:10,980 --> 00:15:15,440
It was perfect—the right size, the right shape, the right location, and the right political

207
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:19,460
status as the US had been given jurisdiction over the Marshall Islands at the end of the

208
00:15:19,460 --> 00:15:20,460
war.

209
00:15:20,460 --> 00:15:27,020
And so, on to tiny Bikini Atoll, the United States moved in 42,000 personnel on 242 ships

210
00:15:27,020 --> 00:15:31,540
and began to experiment with the greatest power ever unleashed by mankind.

211
00:15:31,540 --> 00:15:37,420
First, there was the Crossroads Able Bomb—21 kilotons, far greater than Little Boy, the

212
00:15:37,420 --> 00:15:40,220
15 kiloton bomb dropped on Hiroshima.

213
00:15:40,220 --> 00:15:46,860
Then Crossroads Baker—23 kilotons, but these were nothing compared to what came next.

214
00:15:46,860 --> 00:15:54,140
Castle Bravo.

215
00:15:54,140 --> 00:16:00,180
Detonated on March 1st, 1954, this bomb produced the most powerful explosion the world had

216
00:16:00,180 --> 00:16:06,700
ever seen—15 megatons—1,000 times more powerful than the Hiroshima bomb.

217
00:16:06,700 --> 00:16:12,420
The United States was a triumph—the greatest example yet of nuclear technology's potential.

218
00:16:12,420 --> 00:16:18,660
For Nerje Joseph, a neighboring Rangalap atoll, it was the start of a long nightmare.

219
00:16:18,660 --> 00:16:20,700
My name is Nerje Joseph.

220
00:16:20,700 --> 00:16:22,100
I come from Rangalap.

221
00:16:22,100 --> 00:16:28,700
When I was born in Rangalap, I was in Rangalap in 1954.

222
00:16:28,700 --> 00:16:30,860
The nuclear company.

223
00:16:30,860 --> 00:16:33,540
Nerje was only eight on Bravo Day.

224
00:16:33,540 --> 00:16:37,260
Today, at 74, she still remembers it vividly.

225
00:17:03,540 --> 00:17:33,220
The powder, of course, was nuclear fallout.

226
00:17:33,220 --> 00:17:37,500
Most pieces of coral laced with radiation had been shot up into the air and carried

227
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:38,900
by wind onto Rangalap.

228
00:17:38,900 --> 00:17:42,340
But the people of Rangalap had no idea what it was.

229
00:17:42,340 --> 00:17:46,380
Some of the kids even stuck their tongues out and let it fall into their mouths, thinking

230
00:17:46,380 --> 00:17:48,020
it was snow.

231
00:17:48,020 --> 00:17:52,980
Despite the enormous danger posed to the people of Rangalap, the US didn't evacuate them

232
00:17:52,980 --> 00:17:54,860
for two days.

233
00:17:54,860 --> 00:17:59,100
By that time, the radiation sickness had started to take hold.

234
00:17:59,100 --> 00:18:02,940
The people of Rangalap had no idea what it was.

235
00:18:02,940 --> 00:18:05,940
The people of Rangalap had no idea what it was.

236
00:18:05,940 --> 00:18:07,940
The people of Rangalap had no idea what it was.

237
00:18:07,940 --> 00:18:09,940
The people of Rangalap had no idea what it was.

238
00:18:09,940 --> 00:18:11,940
The people of Rangalap had no idea what it was.

239
00:18:11,940 --> 00:18:13,940
The people of Rangalap had no idea what it was.

240
00:18:13,940 --> 00:18:15,940
The people of Rangalap had no idea what it was.

241
00:18:15,940 --> 00:18:17,940
The people of Rangalap had no idea what it was.

242
00:18:17,940 --> 00:18:19,940
The people of Rangalap had no idea what it was.

243
00:18:19,940 --> 00:18:21,940
The people of Rangalap had no idea what it was.

244
00:18:21,940 --> 00:18:23,940
The people of Rangalap had no idea what it was.

245
00:18:23,940 --> 00:18:25,940
The people of Rangalap had no idea what it was.

246
00:18:26,780 --> 00:18:28,780
The people of Rangalap had no idea what it was.

247
00:18:28,780 --> 00:18:30,780
The people of Rangalap had no idea what it was.

248
00:18:30,780 --> 00:18:32,780
The people of Rangalap had no idea what it was.

249
00:18:32,780 --> 00:18:34,780
The people of Rangalap had no idea what it was.

250
00:18:34,780 --> 00:18:36,780
The people of Rangalap had no idea what it was.

251
00:18:36,780 --> 00:18:38,780
Of the hundreds of people on Rangalap that day,

252
00:18:38,780 --> 00:18:42,780
Nirje is one of just ten who are still alive.

253
00:18:42,780 --> 00:18:44,780
No one on Rangalap died that day,

254
00:18:44,780 --> 00:18:46,780
but that doesn't mean the bomb didn't kill them.

255
00:18:46,780 --> 00:18:48,780
Many fell victim to thyroid cancer

256
00:18:48,780 --> 00:18:50,780
which has been linked to the fallout from Bravo

257
00:18:50,780 --> 00:18:53,780
and none have been able to return to their home.

258
00:18:54,780 --> 00:18:55,780
I…

259
00:18:55,780 --> 00:19:07,180
The collateral damage of nuclear testing isn't

260
00:19:07,180 --> 00:19:09,100
limited only to the people of Rongelao.

261
00:19:09,100 --> 00:19:14,140
There's another group of victims, whose pain began before a single bomb was detonated—the

262
00:19:14,140 --> 00:19:17,620
167 inhabitants of Bikini Atoll.

263
00:19:17,620 --> 00:19:22,100
To the United States, once they'd identified Bikini as a suitable test site, its people

264
00:19:22,100 --> 00:19:25,340
were more of an afterthought than an obstacle.

265
00:19:25,340 --> 00:19:29,960
They asked them if they'd be willing to move for the good of mankind and to end all

266
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:35,340
world wars, and Judah, the leader of the Bikinians, just kept standing up and saying the same

267
00:19:35,340 --> 00:19:36,340
answer every time.

268
00:19:36,340 --> 00:19:41,140
He said, minu teimdei drudigo bienas, which is, everything's in the hands of God.

269
00:19:41,140 --> 00:19:45,660
If you know what I know about Marshallese culture, if someone said to me, if I asked

270
00:19:45,660 --> 00:19:49,500
them if I could do something, they said, everything's in the hands of God, that's about as much

271
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:51,740
as a no as you're ever going to get.

272
00:19:51,740 --> 00:19:52,740
It's in the hands of God.

273
00:19:52,740 --> 00:19:54,900
You better be careful.

274
00:19:54,900 --> 00:19:59,620
But if you watch, they did 26 takes of this same shot.

275
00:19:59,620 --> 00:20:03,640
The Commodore stands up and dusts off his pants and in the end he says, well, everything

276
00:20:03,640 --> 00:20:07,180
being in the hands of God, it cannot be other than good.

277
00:20:07,180 --> 00:20:08,180
And off he walks.

278
00:20:08,180 --> 00:20:14,300
Well, you tell them and King Judah that everything being in God's hands, it cannot be other

279
00:20:14,300 --> 00:20:17,180
than good.

280
00:20:17,180 --> 00:20:21,180
With that, the people of Bikini were evacuated, and while they were told, of course, that

281
00:20:21,180 --> 00:20:25,740
they would one day be able to return to their homes, that, like so many things the Marshalls

282
00:20:25,740 --> 00:20:29,460
were told as nuclear testing began, was a lie.

283
00:20:29,460 --> 00:20:33,940
After they were evacuated, the Bikinians underwent a grueling saga placed by the United States

284
00:20:33,940 --> 00:20:39,260
here on uninhabited Rongorik Atoll, which they soon discovered had toxic fish and land

285
00:20:39,260 --> 00:20:40,940
where nothing grew.

286
00:20:40,940 --> 00:20:45,820
But I think the US looked at Rongorik and looked at Bikini, palm trees, sand, beach,

287
00:20:45,820 --> 00:20:47,940
looks the same, you'll just go there.

288
00:20:47,940 --> 00:20:50,940
And they drop them off there, the Bikinians, and they starve.

289
00:20:50,940 --> 00:20:55,140
After two years, they were moved to tents here at Kwajalein Base, then finally here

290
00:20:55,140 --> 00:21:00,380
to Kili Island, and meanwhile, with each bomb the Americans detonated, more and more of

291
00:21:00,380 --> 00:21:02,740
the Bikinians' land was vaporized.

292
00:21:02,740 --> 00:21:07,420
The little that remained was laced with nuclear radiation that wouldn't dissipate for thousands

293
00:21:07,420 --> 00:21:08,420
of years.

294
00:21:08,420 --> 00:21:15,340
In late 1960s, President Johnson, on the front page of the New York Times, on a Sunday edition,

295
00:21:15,340 --> 00:21:19,920
said that Bikini was now safe on recommendations from the Atomic Energy Commission that everybody

296
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:20,920
could go back.

297
00:21:20,920 --> 00:21:26,240
While they were skeptical, many were so desperate to return home that they went, choosing to

298
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:28,080
trust the Americans.

299
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:32,700
Perhaps unsurprisingly, that trust was not rewarded.

300
00:21:32,700 --> 00:21:38,520
And after about eight or nine years, they discovered that the people were ingesting

301
00:21:38,520 --> 00:21:43,880
the food grown on the island, and the cesium-137 radioactive element was going up into the

302
00:21:43,880 --> 00:21:48,180
crops and they were eating this, so it was discovered in the late 70s that they had these

303
00:21:48,180 --> 00:21:52,900
very high body versions of cesium-137, so they moved them off again and they haven't

304
00:21:52,900 --> 00:21:53,900
been back since.

305
00:21:53,900 --> 00:22:00,120
In the end, the United States dropped 67 nuclear bombs on the Marshall Islands.

306
00:22:00,120 --> 00:22:05,180
Still today, many parts of the country show radiation levels that far exceed those of

307
00:22:05,180 --> 00:22:07,420
Chernobyl.

308
00:22:07,420 --> 00:22:13,400
It was really, the Cold War was fought and won by the United States on the shores of

309
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:15,560
Bikini and Eniwetok and the Marshall Islands.

310
00:22:15,560 --> 00:22:20,720
We really gave a lot to the United States and the idea that it's not even talked about

311
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:30,000
is really kind of, for lack of a better word, I would say it's insulting.

312
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:34,280
As the Marshall Islands struggles to lift itself from the crater of nuclear testing,

313
00:22:34,280 --> 00:22:43,720
a new threat looms—one whose capacity for destruction dwarfs that of an atomic warhead—water.

314
00:22:43,740 --> 00:22:51,100
Recall for a moment the attributes of an atoll—comprised of coral, small in size, and notably narrow.

315
00:22:51,100 --> 00:22:57,580
Now add to that mental picture two more tragic geological truths—atolls are extraordinarily

316
00:22:57,580 --> 00:23:04,280
low-lying and exceedingly flat, which is to say, by their very nature, atolls are uniquely,

317
00:23:04,280 --> 00:23:10,440
acutely susceptible to the deadly power of a rising sea.

318
00:23:10,440 --> 00:23:18,480
The implications are dire for this atoll nation and similar atoll nations.

319
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:22,840
Most of the atolls of the Marshall Islands sit at less than six feet above sea level.

320
00:23:22,840 --> 00:23:29,840
Marshallese homes, businesses, streets, people sit at less than six feet above sea level.

321
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:36,240
As temperatures rise and seize with them, that six feet begins to disappear fast.

322
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:45,840
Imagine an aircraft carrier that has a freeboard of perhaps, I don't know, 150 feet.

323
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:56,520
But if you lowered that freeboard to six feet and sea level rose seven feet, well, the picture

324
00:23:56,520 --> 00:24:04,720
is pretty plain for anyone to imagine, and that's precisely what is predicted to happen

325
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:08,240
and what is happening gradually for atolls.

326
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:15,360
It's not just erosion, but there's actual land loss, submergence, but also the deprivation

327
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:22,520
of the use of land for any viable purpose, including simply to live on.

328
00:24:22,520 --> 00:24:31,520
People who have not visited an atoll have really no concept of what it means not to

329
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:36,560
have land in an oceanic expanse as vast as the Pacific.

330
00:24:36,560 --> 00:24:41,480
So any loss in land is dire.

331
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:52,960
Thirty feet of land on a high island is still significant, but 30 feet of land loss or unavailability

332
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:59,480
of land for living on is a tragedy on an atoll.

333
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:06,480
For the Marshallese, land loss isn't just devastating from a scientific perspective—it's

334
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:10,040
corrosive to the fundamental tenets of their culture.

335
00:25:10,040 --> 00:25:14,540
While nearly all societies prize land, in the Marshall Islands, the relationship between

336
00:25:14,540 --> 00:25:18,440
its people and land is especially precious.

337
00:25:18,440 --> 00:25:22,080
You have to understand that every Marshallese is attached to a piece of land.

338
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:26,360
My kids all have, they know where their pieces of land are on Bikini, and that's their

339
00:25:26,360 --> 00:25:29,840
gift from God, and that's like their anchor in life.

340
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:34,360
Marshallese people have a connection to land, not just the land but the ocean, right?

341
00:25:34,360 --> 00:25:36,140
We have a connection to place.

342
00:25:36,140 --> 00:25:39,820
Everybody owns land in the Marshalls, but not just that.

343
00:25:39,820 --> 00:25:48,460
Every piece of land has some story, some marking, some name that's ancient, that's deep.

344
00:25:48,460 --> 00:25:54,680
What happens to that knowledge if you lose that land, if you lose that connection?

345
00:25:54,680 --> 00:25:58,400
What happens to who you are as a person, to our identity?

346
00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:03,640
But the Marshallese, the people who settled distant atolls, who navigated through an unforgiving

347
00:26:03,640 --> 00:26:09,480
sea, who endured colonization, disease, war, and 63 nuclear bombs, refused to allow their

348
00:26:09,480 --> 00:26:12,680
ocean to be turned into a weapon against them.

349
00:26:12,680 --> 00:26:16,400
And so, they decided to fight back, but they couldn't do it alone.

350
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:22,040
At the end of the day, Marshall Islands contributes .00001% of the world's global emissions.

351
00:26:22,040 --> 00:26:27,040
It could be the most solarized island on the planet, and it would still go underwater if

352
00:26:27,040 --> 00:26:31,980
the rest of the world doesn't take it into consideration and make changes, right?

353
00:26:31,980 --> 00:26:34,280
So we have to fight on a global level.

354
00:26:34,280 --> 00:26:38,520
What the Marshallese, through their climate activism, are fighting to defend is complex

355
00:26:38,520 --> 00:26:45,080
and multifaceted—a combination of culture, tradition, soil, coral, homes, language, history,

356
00:26:45,080 --> 00:26:46,080
and people.

357
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:50,720
Yet what they hope to achieve can be condensed to a single number—1.5.

358
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:56,080
1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels.

359
00:26:56,120 --> 00:27:01,240
That's the magic number for the Marshallese—the limit for how much the earth can warm before

360
00:27:01,240 --> 00:27:05,020
their island home becomes uninhabitable.

361
00:27:05,020 --> 00:27:09,240
If global temperatures creep above 1.5, it's lights out.

362
00:27:09,240 --> 00:27:11,040
Streets and houses flood.

363
00:27:11,040 --> 00:27:12,440
Land disappears.

364
00:27:12,440 --> 00:27:14,200
Crops die.

365
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:20,360
Above 1.5, the atolls which, for thousands of years, have supported life, transform into

366
00:27:20,360 --> 00:27:22,960
engines of death.

367
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:29,040
Mitigating climate change in any meaningful way is already a nearly insurmountable endeavor—limiting

368
00:27:29,040 --> 00:27:32,300
it to 1.5 would be next to impossible.

369
00:27:32,300 --> 00:27:35,920
The Marshallese would face opposition from not only governments and industry, but also

370
00:27:35,920 --> 00:27:41,540
from other climate change activists whose focus had long been on a different number—2.

371
00:27:41,540 --> 00:27:46,520
Limiting temperature rise to 2 degrees above pre-industrial levels had, for many years,

372
00:27:46,520 --> 00:27:51,040
been the aim of policy, the object of studies, and the goal of activists.

373
00:27:51,040 --> 00:27:56,220
In the mainstream climate change debate, 2 wasn't the backup, the worst-case scenario,

374
00:27:56,220 --> 00:27:57,220
the not-too-bad.

375
00:27:57,220 --> 00:28:01,720
2 was seen as the ideal, the ambition, the gold standard.

376
00:28:01,720 --> 00:28:05,800
1.5, on the other hand, was to many a pipe dream.

377
00:28:05,800 --> 00:28:10,680
It was called unrealistic, impossible, a distraction, but the Marshallese knew that it was the only

378
00:28:10,680 --> 00:28:13,320
way for their atolls to survive.

379
00:28:13,320 --> 00:28:18,760
And it was not just the Marshalls—above 1.5, atoll nations like Tuvalu, the Maldives,

380
00:28:18,760 --> 00:28:21,760
and Kiribati would face the same fate.

381
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:29,120
Among these most vulnerable countries, a motto soon emerged—1.5 to stay alive.

382
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:34,560
The fight for 1.5 would be far from easy, but they knew where it would have to be won—the

383
00:28:34,560 --> 00:28:40,440
2015 United Nations Climate Change Conference in Paris, where 196 countries would come together

384
00:28:40,440 --> 00:28:44,040
to develop a global plan for combating global warming.

385
00:28:44,040 --> 00:28:48,560
But, before they could do that, they had to build influence.

386
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:53,120
A Marshallese government minister named Tony de Broom started building relationships and

387
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:57,400
rallying support around the world making a name for the small Marshall Islands in the

388
00:28:57,400 --> 00:29:00,040
big world of climate change activism.

389
00:29:00,040 --> 00:29:04,720
He represented the Marshalls at conferences and meetings all over the world—in Copenhagen,

390
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:09,400
in Doha, in Warsaw, in Lima—joining with other countries as part of the Alliance of

391
00:29:09,400 --> 00:29:11,340
Small Island States.

392
00:29:11,340 --> 00:29:15,380
And while de Broom made impressive progress, when it comes to geopolitics, there's only

393
00:29:15,380 --> 00:29:19,860
so much influence and power that can be amassed by an atoll nation with a population lower

394
00:29:19,860 --> 00:29:21,580
than most small cities.

395
00:29:21,580 --> 00:29:27,260
So, he began work on a new coalition—one that could emerge at Paris to force the conversation

396
00:29:27,260 --> 00:29:30,800
to 1.5—but it needed a spark.

397
00:29:30,800 --> 00:29:35,900
In September 2014, that spark came, when the UN Climate Summit invited Marshallese poet

398
00:29:35,900 --> 00:29:39,240
Kathy Jettnall-Kishner to speak at their opening ceremony.

399
00:29:39,240 --> 00:29:43,940
With the entire nation on her shoulders, she read to the gathered leaders of the world

400
00:29:43,940 --> 00:29:46,860
a letter she had written to her newborn daughter.

401
00:30:14,660 --> 00:30:19,680
Dear Mata Felipe, I want to tell you about that lagoon.

402
00:30:19,680 --> 00:30:23,340
That lazy lounging lagoon lounging against the sunrise.

403
00:30:23,340 --> 00:30:27,840
Men say that one day that lagoon will devour you.

404
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:32,180
They say it will gnaw at the shoreline, chew at the roots of your red fruit trees, gulp

405
00:30:32,180 --> 00:30:36,980
down rows of seawalls, and crunch through your island's shattered bones.

406
00:30:37,020 --> 00:30:44,660
They say you, your daughter, and your granddaughter, too, will wander, ruthless, with only a passport

407
00:30:44,660 --> 00:30:46,900
to call home.

408
00:30:46,900 --> 00:30:50,140
Dear Mata Felipe, don't cry.

409
00:30:50,140 --> 00:30:52,220
No one's drowning, baby.

410
00:30:52,220 --> 00:30:53,680
No one's moving.

411
00:30:53,680 --> 00:30:55,820
No one's losing their homeland.

412
00:30:55,820 --> 00:31:00,300
No one's becoming a climate change refugee.

413
00:31:00,300 --> 00:31:03,940
Or should I say, no one else.

414
00:31:03,940 --> 00:31:09,220
To the Carteret Islanders of Papua New Guinea and to the Tarot Islanders of Fiji, I take

415
00:31:09,220 --> 00:31:12,520
this moment to apologize to you.

416
00:31:12,520 --> 00:31:17,720
We are drawing the line here because we, baby, are going to fight.

417
00:31:17,720 --> 00:31:23,500
Your mommy, daddy, boo-boo, Jima, your country, and your president, too, we will all fight.

418
00:31:23,500 --> 00:31:29,260
And even though there are those hidden behind platinum titles who like to pretend that we

419
00:31:29,260 --> 00:31:35,580
don't exist, who like to pretend that the Marshall Islands, Tuvalu, Kiribati, Maldives,

420
00:31:35,580 --> 00:31:41,820
Typhoon Haiyan in the Philippines, floods of Algeria, Colombia, Pakistan, and all the hurricanes,

421
00:31:41,820 --> 00:31:51,740
earthquakes, and tidal waves didn't exist, still, there are those who see us, hands reaching

422
00:31:51,740 --> 00:32:00,140
out, fists raising up, banners unfurling, megaphones booming, and we are canoes blocking

423
00:32:00,140 --> 00:32:01,140
coal ships.

424
00:32:01,140 --> 00:32:03,980
We are the radiance of solar villages.

425
00:32:03,980 --> 00:32:07,860
We are the fresh, clean soil of the farmer's past.

426
00:32:07,860 --> 00:32:11,040
We are teenagers, blooming petitions.

427
00:32:11,040 --> 00:32:17,260
We are families, biking, recycling, reusing, engineers, building, dreaming, designing,

428
00:32:17,260 --> 00:32:23,060
artists, painting, dancing, writing, and we are spreading the word.

429
00:32:23,060 --> 00:32:28,820
And there are thousands out on the streets, marching hand in hand, chanting for change

430
00:32:28,820 --> 00:32:29,820
now.

431
00:32:29,820 --> 00:32:33,500
And they're marching for you, baby.

432
00:32:33,500 --> 00:32:40,060
They're marching for us because we deserve to do more than just survive.

433
00:32:40,060 --> 00:32:43,020
We deserve to thrive.

434
00:32:43,020 --> 00:32:49,980
Dear Mata Felipe, you are eyes heavy with drowsy weight, so just close those eyes and

435
00:32:49,980 --> 00:32:52,140
sleep in peace.

436
00:32:52,140 --> 00:32:57,420
Because we won't let you down, you'll see.

437
00:32:57,420 --> 00:33:00,940
Standing ovations aren't common at the United Nations.

438
00:33:00,940 --> 00:33:05,860
Kathy's lasted a full minute.

439
00:33:05,860 --> 00:33:11,220
Why do you think poetry is an effective means of activism?

440
00:33:11,220 --> 00:33:16,340
What is it about poetry that you think makes people listen?

441
00:33:16,340 --> 00:33:20,580
Well I think poetry forces people to slow down and connect to the emotion of the issue,

442
00:33:20,580 --> 00:33:21,580
right?

443
00:33:21,580 --> 00:33:29,440
Rather than just facts and data and fear and, you know, written statements, right?

444
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:30,840
Poetry is personal.

445
00:33:30,840 --> 00:33:35,160
Poetry connects you to the issue and connects you to why you should care about the issue.

446
00:33:35,160 --> 00:33:38,100
And then, it was time to go to Paris.

447
00:33:38,100 --> 00:33:43,340
The Paris conference lasted 14 days, and for the first 11, nearly all discussion centered

448
00:33:43,340 --> 00:33:45,320
around two degrees.

449
00:33:45,320 --> 00:33:50,180
But in the final three days of negotiation, Tony de Broom began to execute his plan when

450
00:33:50,180 --> 00:33:56,380
he unveiled the High Ambition Coalition—a previously secret alliance of over 90 countries

451
00:33:56,380 --> 00:33:59,760
that Tony had spent the last year coalescing.

452
00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:04,880
The High Ambition Coalition ranged from the small atoll of Kiribati to the powerful nations

453
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:10,080
of the European Union and together, they turned the entire conference on its head,

454
00:34:10,080 --> 00:34:13,640
demanding the agreement include 1.5.

455
00:34:13,640 --> 00:34:18,220
It was such a jarring and extraordinary show of power orchestrated by such a small nation

456
00:34:18,220 --> 00:34:21,040
that many said it couldn't be real.

457
00:34:21,040 --> 00:34:25,000
Chinese negotiators called it meaningless, representatives from Bangladesh called it

458
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:31,440
a stunt, and in truth, it was not completely clear just how formal this coalition was—unpressed,

459
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:33,960
Tony couldn't even say how many members it had.

460
00:34:34,040 --> 00:34:37,680
But it didn't matter, because the momentum had already changed.

461
00:34:37,680 --> 00:34:42,880
New countries began to join—Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Iceland, Sweden.

462
00:34:42,880 --> 00:34:47,560
Before long, a majority of the represented nations supported 1.5.

463
00:34:47,560 --> 00:34:54,080
In less than three days, Tony de Broom took 1.5 from pipe dream to reality.

464
00:34:54,080 --> 00:34:59,600
In the end, 184 countries resolved that they would, quote, hold the increase in the global

465
00:34:59,600 --> 00:35:04,440
temperature to well below 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels and pursue efforts

466
00:35:04,440 --> 00:35:09,680
to limit the temperature increase to 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels.

467
00:35:09,680 --> 00:35:12,480
They got 1.5 in there, right?

468
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:20,120
1.5, huge for us, the global temperature, you know, to maintain our survival.

469
00:35:20,120 --> 00:35:24,800
Before we went to that conference, I was told by many people that 1.5 wouldn't make it

470
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:25,800
in there.

471
00:35:25,800 --> 00:35:27,520
It was too hard.

472
00:35:27,520 --> 00:35:30,640
Even though for our survival, we need that temperature to be recognized.

473
00:35:30,640 --> 00:35:34,280
Yeah, Tony was the one that orchestrated that.

474
00:35:34,280 --> 00:35:40,760
And so beyond that, you know, we've also continued that momentum from Tony's legacy

475
00:35:40,760 --> 00:35:41,760
once he passed on.

476
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:50,560
Yes, we were kind of a champion for climate change in the Paris meeting, you know, by

477
00:35:50,560 --> 00:35:59,080
working with a group of people, which was called the Eye Ambition Group.

478
00:35:59,080 --> 00:36:06,080
And it was kind of amazing for us to be able to gather a number of people who supported

479
00:36:06,080 --> 00:36:12,000
us during the meetings and resulted in the Paris Accord.

480
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:18,480
It was an enormous, unexpected, deserved victory, but it didn't last.

481
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:22,520
The Paris Agreement was, without a doubt, the most important collective step the world

482
00:36:22,520 --> 00:36:24,920
had made towards solving climate change.

483
00:36:24,920 --> 00:36:29,680
It was also, in many ways, a complete and utter failure.

484
00:36:29,680 --> 00:36:33,800
Many of the pledges made by countries were unspecific, unambitious, and perhaps most

485
00:36:33,800 --> 00:36:36,080
importantly, unenforceable.

486
00:36:36,080 --> 00:36:41,760
In Paris, the world promised to pursue efforts to limit temperatures to 1.5.

487
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:45,000
Already in 2015, it was a weak promise.

488
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:48,040
The five years since have proved it meaningless.

489
00:36:48,080 --> 00:36:52,440
Paris was supposed to serve as a starting place, with more ambitious pledges to be made

490
00:36:52,440 --> 00:36:53,440
in the future.

491
00:36:53,440 --> 00:36:59,100
Now, it is the future, and the more ambitious pledges are nowhere to be found.

492
00:36:59,100 --> 00:37:04,480
And even the inadequate commitments of Paris have often been completely ignored.

493
00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:07,920
In stories, the underdog is supposed to win.

494
00:37:07,920 --> 00:37:13,000
When they give it their all, when they combine dreams and drive, when they form a high ambition

495
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:17,920
coalition, when they read Dear Mattaffé le Penem, when they chant 1.5 to stay alive,

496
00:37:17,920 --> 00:37:20,320
it's supposed to work.

497
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:27,600
Today, projections show that under the best case scenario, we'll reach 1.5 in 2052.

498
00:37:27,600 --> 00:37:29,840
Worst case, 2030.

499
00:37:29,840 --> 00:37:36,320
Either way, in a few short decades, three millennia of marshally civilization will come

500
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:39,600
to an end.

501
00:37:39,600 --> 00:37:44,480
Currently today, flooding and inundation are common in the Marshall Islands, but things

502
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:49,160
get especially bad during what the marshallese call King Tides.

503
00:37:49,160 --> 00:37:56,280
The islands are becoming more and more inundated with waters during spring tide and also during

504
00:37:56,280 --> 00:37:57,320
king's tide.

505
00:37:57,320 --> 00:38:03,880
When the high tide, king tide comes, it destroys the whole village, the water comes to the

506
00:38:03,880 --> 00:38:04,880
road.

507
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:07,760
My cousin lost her house in a really bad king tide flooding.

508
00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:10,960
Since 2011, we've seen more and more king tides.

509
00:38:10,960 --> 00:38:17,280
A combination of lunar cycles, wind patterns, and of course, rising seas coalesce into waves

510
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:20,120
that flood streets, yards, and homes.

511
00:38:20,120 --> 00:38:25,600
For the marshallese, the destruction and disorder king tides bring have become an increasingly

512
00:38:25,600 --> 00:38:27,680
normal part of everyday life.

513
00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:33,680
We're flat as a pancake here and if you go out today, 545's the high tide, you know

514
00:38:33,680 --> 00:38:34,680
why I know that?

515
00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:38,200
Because yesterday I was driving home a little after five and the water was splashing, I

516
00:38:38,200 --> 00:38:44,080
drive Volkswagens, the water splashing on a, salt water splashing on a Volkswagon is

517
00:38:44,080 --> 00:38:47,360
not a good feeling because they melt with the rust.

518
00:38:47,360 --> 00:38:51,080
And so I knew today, I always know when the high tide is because I worry about that kind

519
00:38:51,080 --> 00:38:52,080
of stuff.

520
00:38:52,080 --> 00:38:54,700
But other people worry about it too because it's hitting their houses.

521
00:38:54,700 --> 00:38:57,840
You never used to know when high tides were out unless you were someone who was out at

522
00:38:57,840 --> 00:39:02,160
the sea all the time and you were a diver or whatever and you counted on that stuff.

523
00:39:02,160 --> 00:39:05,000
Now everybody kind of knows when the big high tide is going to be and they know what

524
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:06,000
they have to do.

525
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:08,440
We never used to think like that here, ever.

526
00:39:08,440 --> 00:39:13,000
Flooding and inundation don't just destroy what's been created on the atoll.

527
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:16,720
It also destroys the atoll's ability to create.

528
00:39:16,720 --> 00:39:26,040
The water is coming up on the ground too and also contaminating our well waters and affecting

529
00:39:26,040 --> 00:39:28,600
our food crops.

530
00:39:28,600 --> 00:39:33,520
And of course the breadfruit trees that we used to depend on to build our canoes and

531
00:39:33,520 --> 00:39:41,360
provide food are dying because the water lengths on these islands are getting smaller and smaller

532
00:39:41,360 --> 00:39:44,360
and they cannot survive the salt water.

533
00:39:44,360 --> 00:39:49,920
But the most pressing effect of climate change is also perhaps the most unexpected.

534
00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:54,400
So currently the most urgent effects are illnesses.

535
00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:57,200
So climate-related illnesses like dengue.

536
00:39:57,200 --> 00:40:01,200
Mosquito-borne illnesses are supposed to increase with climate effects.

537
00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:05,500
So we have three different health issues we're dealing with right now on the Marshall Islands.

538
00:40:05,500 --> 00:40:09,960
The first of course is dengue fever that's been going on for about eight months now.

539
00:40:09,960 --> 00:40:12,840
We've been in a state of health emergency.

540
00:40:12,840 --> 00:40:23,680
The second one is, we've had over 25 cases, 2500 cases of dengue since last July.

541
00:40:23,680 --> 00:40:27,320
And so that's been our major battle we're fighting right here now.

542
00:40:27,320 --> 00:40:31,380
And then secondly, we've had measles, which we haven't had a case yet, but we've put

543
00:40:31,380 --> 00:40:33,640
in all kinds of preventative measures.

544
00:40:33,640 --> 00:40:37,000
And of course coronavirus in the same category, we're just trying to prevent it.

545
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:41,200
We haven't had any yet, but we're being very strict with how people come in.

546
00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:47,120
Actually the way I feel is that most of what we're seeing right now is climate change,

547
00:40:47,120 --> 00:40:49,120
the result of climate change.

548
00:40:49,120 --> 00:40:53,480
With rising temperatures come more mosquitoes, increasing the risk of transmission for insect

549
00:40:53,480 --> 00:40:56,360
borne diseases like Zika and dengue.

550
00:40:56,360 --> 00:41:01,100
More severe water cycles—flooding, high rainfalls, drought—all propagate contaminated

551
00:41:01,100 --> 00:41:06,740
water supplies, increasing the spread of cholera, E. coli, and other diarrheal diseases.

552
00:41:06,740 --> 00:41:12,760
In fact, for almost every infectious disease out there—malaria, Ebola, Lyme, West Nile,

553
00:41:12,760 --> 00:41:17,000
typhoid—research predicts that climate change will make it worse.

554
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:22,360
According to the World Health Organization, over the next 20 years, over 2 million people

555
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:27,040
will die as a result of climate change related disease.

556
00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:28,480
This is like not normal.

557
00:41:28,480 --> 00:41:31,280
This is not nothing that we've ever experienced before.

558
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:33,560
We're in the eighth month of a state of health emergency.

559
00:41:33,560 --> 00:41:37,300
The Marshall Islands has never been in a state of health emergency this long ever.

560
00:41:37,300 --> 00:41:39,840
We've never seen a bigger disease outbreak.

561
00:41:39,840 --> 00:41:43,820
We've never seen all these deaths throughout the Pacific in recent times from things like

562
00:41:43,820 --> 00:41:45,980
measles that we thought were gone.

563
00:41:45,980 --> 00:41:51,360
So I think the really important thing that people have to understand is this is not the

564
00:41:51,360 --> 00:41:56,160
way things used to be, but this is the way it's becoming now normal.

565
00:41:56,160 --> 00:42:00,520
And that to me is a result of the massive climate change and the massive warming that's

566
00:42:00,520 --> 00:42:01,560
been going on.

567
00:42:01,560 --> 00:42:07,320
You have to start talking about health and connecting it to climate change because there's

568
00:42:07,320 --> 00:42:09,240
no other explanation for this.

569
00:42:09,240 --> 00:42:10,360
There really isn't.

570
00:42:10,360 --> 00:42:15,920
When you combine it all—inundation, land loss, crop death, coral bleaching, drought,

571
00:42:15,920 --> 00:42:20,220
disease—a single, clear picture forms.

572
00:42:20,220 --> 00:42:25,880
These are all becoming a potent package which are linked to the adverse effects of climate

573
00:42:25,880 --> 00:42:26,880
change.

574
00:42:26,880 --> 00:42:34,140
And that potency is a bit too much or beyond the capability of small atoll nations to respond

575
00:42:34,140 --> 00:42:35,140
to.

576
00:42:35,140 --> 00:42:43,360
And so all of these packaged, potent adverse effects are proving to be catastrophic.

577
00:42:43,360 --> 00:42:49,460
The future that the Marshall Islands fought so hard to prevent is already coming to pass.

578
00:42:49,460 --> 00:42:59,680
The islands are dying, and soon, they'll be truly, permanently, and irreversibly uninhabitable.

579
00:42:59,680 --> 00:43:05,980
Two options have emerged—stay and fight a losing battle, or leave and start a new

580
00:43:05,980 --> 00:43:06,980
life.

581
00:43:06,980 --> 00:43:09,500
In truth, though, those options are the same.

582
00:43:09,500 --> 00:43:12,980
The only variable is time.

583
00:43:12,980 --> 00:43:18,740
Thousands of miles away, far from the fury of the ocean, a new atoll is emerging.

584
00:43:18,740 --> 00:43:24,840
One encircled not by sea, but by streets—a land made not of coral, but of concrete.

585
00:43:24,840 --> 00:43:29,520
One where abundance is measured not by the size of your family, but rather the sum of

586
00:43:29,520 --> 00:43:30,520
your money.

587
00:43:30,520 --> 00:43:34,160
One dotted not by palm trees, but by poultry plants.

588
00:43:34,160 --> 00:43:39,200
Hope is not plentiful for the Marshallese, but there's a spark of it here, nestled

589
00:43:39,200 --> 00:43:42,540
in the northwestern corner of Arkansas.

590
00:43:42,540 --> 00:43:48,160
Springdale is, I would describe it as more of a blue-collar, working-class community

591
00:43:48,160 --> 00:43:54,240
in the midst of a thriving area of northwest Arkansas, one of the top five fastest growing

592
00:43:54,240 --> 00:43:55,360
areas in the country.

593
00:43:55,360 --> 00:43:56,640
We are a very diverse city.

594
00:43:56,640 --> 00:43:59,600
We've got 44 languages spoken in our school district.

595
00:43:59,600 --> 00:44:08,200
Our two largest minorities would be Latino, which is probably somewhere around 35 to 40

596
00:44:08,200 --> 00:44:09,200
percent.

597
00:44:09,200 --> 00:44:10,200
Could be a little higher.

598
00:44:10,200 --> 00:44:16,720
We'll find out in the 2020 census, and a large Marshallese population.

599
00:44:16,720 --> 00:44:22,400
We've been told the largest Marshallese population outside of the Marshall Islands.

600
00:44:22,400 --> 00:44:27,800
Exact figures vary—2010 census numbers peg it in the low thousands, but that figure is

601
00:44:27,800 --> 00:44:29,920
almost certainly inaccurate.

602
00:44:29,920 --> 00:44:35,760
In reality, currently, it is believed that as many as 15,000 Marshallese live in the

603
00:44:35,760 --> 00:44:42,920
Springdale area—one fifth of all Marshallese people tucked away in this small Ozark city.

604
00:44:42,920 --> 00:44:48,560
Of course, in a country of countless options, the question to some might be, why Springdale,

605
00:44:48,560 --> 00:44:49,560
Arkansas?

606
00:44:49,560 --> 00:44:53,800
The story, as it's told, begins in 1979.

607
00:44:53,800 --> 00:44:59,600
A Marshallese man named John Moody was awarded a scholarship to the University of Oklahoma—a

608
00:44:59,600 --> 00:45:03,240
dream coming from a nation yet to have a single college.

609
00:45:03,240 --> 00:45:07,020
Moody soon decided, though, that he wasn't cut out for the academic life.

610
00:45:07,020 --> 00:45:11,680
He shifted paths, taking a job at a poultry plant in Muskogee, Oklahoma, earning $3.25

611
00:45:12,040 --> 00:45:16,640
an hour—multiples more than any comparable job in the Marshalls.

612
00:45:16,640 --> 00:45:21,200
Soon, though, the business took him to the largest poultry producer in the world, Tyson

613
00:45:21,200 --> 00:45:24,840
Foods, headquartered in Springdale, Arkansas.

614
00:45:24,840 --> 00:45:29,480
Pay was decent, openings were plentiful, and English was optional, so word soon traveled

615
00:45:29,480 --> 00:45:35,260
from Moody to his family in the Marshalls that Springdale was the land of opportunity.

616
00:45:35,260 --> 00:45:39,920
So they came, and spread the word to others, and they came, and spread the word, and more

617
00:45:39,920 --> 00:45:45,200
came, and spread the word, and soon enough, as the social networks of a small nation saturated

618
00:45:45,200 --> 00:45:50,240
with the promise of a better life, Springdale established itself as the destination for

619
00:45:50,240 --> 00:45:53,000
Marshallese immigration to the US.

620
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:58,880
Now, decades on, what started as one man in a chicken plant has turned into the largest

621
00:45:58,880 --> 00:46:02,960
population of Marshallese outside of the islands themselves.

622
00:46:02,960 --> 00:46:07,680
The city has 30-odd Marshallese churches, has become a key campaign stop for Marshallese

623
00:46:07,680 --> 00:46:12,200
politicians, and it's even home to a tiny consulate representing the Marshallese government

624
00:46:12,200 --> 00:46:13,620
itself.

625
00:46:13,620 --> 00:46:17,640
The mission is one of just eight the Marshalls have abroad.

626
00:46:17,640 --> 00:46:21,800
Sharing a modest two-story building with a barber, accountant, and lawyer, it is the

627
00:46:21,800 --> 00:46:27,080
only consulate of any nation for hundreds of miles and one of only two in the state

628
00:46:27,080 --> 00:46:28,080
of Arkansas.

629
00:46:28,080 --> 00:46:34,160
It's staffed just by an assistant, the consul's wife, and the consul general himself.

630
00:46:34,160 --> 00:46:35,160
My name is Eldon Alik.

631
00:46:35,160 --> 00:46:39,520
I'm the consul general for the Republic of the Marshall Islands here in Springdale,

632
00:46:39,520 --> 00:46:40,520
Arkansas.

633
00:46:40,520 --> 00:46:45,680
The job of the consul is to, number one, provide consul services to the Marshallese citizens

634
00:46:45,680 --> 00:46:52,400
here, and assist the Marshallese population here with whatever they need.

635
00:46:52,400 --> 00:46:57,240
Try to be the eyes and ears of the government of the Marshall Islands here.

636
00:46:57,240 --> 00:47:01,960
Call it luck or call it intuition, but Moody and the thousands that followed were right

637
00:47:01,960 --> 00:47:04,640
to choose Springdale as their new homes.

638
00:47:04,640 --> 00:47:09,120
The city has been experiencing a decades-long economic boom.

639
00:47:09,120 --> 00:47:15,680
We have an entrepreneurial spirit here in northwest Arkansas, not only Springdale, but

640
00:47:15,680 --> 00:47:24,560
we've seen many Fortune 100 companies, Walmart, of course, about 30 miles north.

641
00:47:24,560 --> 00:47:31,560
We've got Tyson right here in Springdale, which is the first or second largest protein

642
00:47:31,560 --> 00:47:33,120
producer in the world.

643
00:47:33,120 --> 00:47:39,280
We have, because of our growth, certainly the building industry, the building trades.

644
00:47:39,280 --> 00:47:45,060
There's a lot going on here that, you know, our unemployment right now is just barely

645
00:47:45,060 --> 00:47:47,520
over 2% in Springdale.

646
00:47:47,520 --> 00:47:52,240
Pretty much anyone who wants one, no matter their age, origin, or education level, can

647
00:47:52,240 --> 00:47:54,280
get a job in Springdale.

648
00:47:54,280 --> 00:47:58,840
Well, Marshallese, we generally like to follow one another.

649
00:47:58,840 --> 00:48:01,120
We come here to be near our families.

650
00:48:01,120 --> 00:48:05,560
The poultry industry doesn't really take a lot of skills and education.

651
00:48:05,560 --> 00:48:06,840
People just come here and they can work.

652
00:48:06,840 --> 00:48:09,240
They're going to arrive today and work tomorrow.

653
00:48:09,240 --> 00:48:13,640
Under the Compact of Free Association, any Marshallese citizen can live and work in the

654
00:48:13,640 --> 00:48:20,000
US—a right others, at best, wait years or decades to attain.

655
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:21,920
But there are still barriers.

656
00:48:21,920 --> 00:48:25,600
Perhaps the most significant is the first—getting there.

657
00:48:25,600 --> 00:48:32,240
A one-way plane ticket from Majuro to Springdale costs about $1,500—a substantial sum for

658
00:48:32,240 --> 00:48:35,680
anyone but a fortune in the Marshall Islands.

659
00:48:35,680 --> 00:48:39,680
There, $1,500 is half a year's wage.

660
00:48:39,680 --> 00:48:43,720
In Springdale, though, $1,500 is less than a month's.

661
00:48:43,720 --> 00:48:47,320
Some families, they come here little by little.

662
00:48:47,320 --> 00:48:52,120
Sometimes they just send the father first, and then the mother, and then the kids, and

663
00:48:52,120 --> 00:48:54,120
then the parents, the grandparents.

664
00:48:54,480 --> 00:48:56,480
So they just do little by little.

665
00:48:56,480 --> 00:49:02,640
Each earns enough to pay for the next, over time bringing the entire family to Springdale.

666
00:49:02,640 --> 00:49:09,960
So we did a study, and the majority of the people that actually took the study replied

667
00:49:09,960 --> 00:49:16,040
that family responsibility was the first reason why they moved.

668
00:49:16,040 --> 00:49:22,520
You know, and usually their departure from the islands are very, very unplanned.

669
00:49:22,520 --> 00:49:27,600
That's because, you know, a sister would call in and say, hey, I have some money.

670
00:49:27,600 --> 00:49:29,600
I have some money to buy you a ticket.

671
00:49:29,600 --> 00:49:30,600
Get ready.

672
00:49:30,600 --> 00:49:35,400
You're going to be on the plane in the next two weeks, so you can come and help me with

673
00:49:35,400 --> 00:49:38,880
my mom or, you know, with someone so I can find a job.

674
00:49:38,880 --> 00:49:44,640
And while you take care of the family member, you know, I have a way to bring income into

675
00:49:44,640 --> 00:49:45,640
the house.

676
00:49:45,640 --> 00:49:49,960
Despite their political, economic, and social connections, though, the Marshall Islands

677
00:49:49,960 --> 00:49:54,680
and the United States are not the same, and the adjustment is not always easy.

678
00:49:54,680 --> 00:50:02,280
There are just so many cultural barriers that we see on a daily basis.

679
00:50:02,280 --> 00:50:09,040
One is, Marshallese culture is a very sharing culture, you know, one property is owned by

680
00:50:09,040 --> 00:50:10,040
everyone.

681
00:50:10,040 --> 00:50:16,640
It's just not individual ownership of their property, but, you know, everyone in that

682
00:50:16,640 --> 00:50:18,840
clan owns it.

683
00:50:18,840 --> 00:50:26,560
And when you look in terms of households, it is perfectly okay for multiple family members

684
00:50:26,560 --> 00:50:33,280
to live under one roof, whereas, you know, here, you know, you have those, the enforced

685
00:50:33,280 --> 00:50:35,440
codes where it's prohibited.

686
00:50:35,440 --> 00:50:41,600
You know, I don't know what the codes of ordinances in the Marshall Islands look like, but I can

687
00:50:41,600 --> 00:50:45,580
be pretty confident they're quite a bit different than ours here in Springdale, Arkansas.

688
00:50:45,580 --> 00:50:53,880
We came from a world that money really didn't mean anything for us, but here it is.

689
00:50:53,880 --> 00:50:58,700
People in the United States, they were economically driven, whereas we're not.

690
00:50:58,700 --> 00:51:00,680
We never had to pay rent.

691
00:51:00,680 --> 00:51:08,040
We never have to worry about having a lot of money so we can buy food because, you know,

692
00:51:08,040 --> 00:51:13,460
you have our biggest refrigerator was the ocean, and it was right there, is readily

693
00:51:13,460 --> 00:51:14,460
available.

694
00:51:14,460 --> 00:51:16,620
So we really didn't have to worry about saving.

695
00:51:16,620 --> 00:51:20,500
You're comparing a very small world to a big world.

696
00:51:20,500 --> 00:51:26,300
Nonetheless, in making the difficult transition to America, having a familiar community makes

697
00:51:26,300 --> 00:51:27,300
it easier.

698
00:51:27,300 --> 00:51:30,340
You're surrounded by over 35 churches.

699
00:51:30,340 --> 00:51:32,080
That's amazing.

700
00:51:32,080 --> 00:51:37,180
And you have a consul general's office here, you have our office as well, you have other

701
00:51:37,180 --> 00:51:40,060
non-profit offices as well.

702
00:51:40,060 --> 00:51:45,900
And the people are very supportive in this area, very supportive of the Marshallese community.

703
00:51:45,900 --> 00:51:53,460
It kind of like gives you that value in preserving your culture and I think that's why I refer

704
00:51:53,460 --> 00:52:00,380
Springdale to as Springdale 8 Holes because this is really the culture, this is the hub

705
00:52:00,380 --> 00:52:03,260
of the culture.

706
00:52:03,260 --> 00:52:08,100
Popular media might predict that the story of a group of people from a far-off land descending

707
00:52:08,100 --> 00:52:13,780
on and settling a small southern city would end in tension and animosity.

708
00:52:13,780 --> 00:52:16,620
That is not the story of Springdale.

709
00:52:16,620 --> 00:52:20,580
You know, I wish I knew what the secret sauce was for that because I think we could use

710
00:52:20,580 --> 00:52:27,820
that in a lot of places throughout our country, this openness and willingness to accept change.

711
00:52:27,820 --> 00:52:29,860
And I don't want to candy-coat it.

712
00:52:29,860 --> 00:52:34,620
There are other people who grew up here just like me that continue to talk about the good

713
00:52:34,620 --> 00:52:39,180
old days and the days when we grew up and things were different.

714
00:52:39,180 --> 00:52:43,520
But you know, I'm just reminded that we're somebody's good old days right now.

715
00:52:43,520 --> 00:52:47,920
The people growing up here right now will look back on this time as the good old days

716
00:52:47,920 --> 00:52:50,780
no matter what it looks like.

717
00:52:50,780 --> 00:52:58,460
And so I think a willingness on the part of the people of Springdale to treat people as

718
00:52:58,460 --> 00:53:02,980
human beings, surely there's nothing special about Springdale.

719
00:53:02,980 --> 00:53:06,500
Probably everyone, every place can do that.

720
00:53:06,500 --> 00:53:10,620
Springdale, as it exists for the Marshallese, is fortuitous.

721
00:53:10,620 --> 00:53:15,100
Fortuitous because John Moody and the early migrants who followed had no idea of their

722
00:53:15,100 --> 00:53:16,740
island's bleak fate.

723
00:53:16,740 --> 00:53:22,180
They migrated for a brighter economic future, but now, with the direct threat of a rising

724
00:53:22,180 --> 00:53:26,620
ocean, Marshallese are starting to migrate to escape the water.

725
00:53:26,620 --> 00:53:31,380
I think some people have a, well, because obviously they have a rice, and that wasn't

726
00:53:31,380 --> 00:53:34,540
the case maybe five, ten years ago.

727
00:53:34,540 --> 00:53:38,860
People were coming here for better opportunities, but I've talked to some people and they've

728
00:53:38,860 --> 00:53:41,500
come here for sea level rise.

729
00:53:41,500 --> 00:53:48,740
Plan A is staying and live there and fight, fight the climate change, but if Plan A doesn't

730
00:53:48,740 --> 00:53:52,740
work, you know, this is where I feel the calling.

731
00:53:52,740 --> 00:53:54,660
This is where I need to be at.

732
00:53:54,660 --> 00:54:02,060
And if really, if that happens, that's, wow, that's taking away our identity, you know,

733
00:54:02,060 --> 00:54:05,780
that's basically stripping us down to the bare skin.

734
00:54:05,780 --> 00:54:07,460
And I'm not sure how I'm going to take that.

735
00:54:07,460 --> 00:54:10,620
That will be very hard for me to process.

736
00:54:10,620 --> 00:54:18,580
However, I feel that I can't just cry and feel sad because that happened.

737
00:54:18,580 --> 00:54:19,820
I have to do something.

738
00:54:19,820 --> 00:54:22,180
I have to make, reestablish.

739
00:54:22,180 --> 00:54:29,180
I feel like reestablishing somewhere else that is safe, that provides you the freedom,

740
00:54:29,180 --> 00:54:35,580
the freedom to make a choice, is probably my next thing that I will focus on.

741
00:54:35,580 --> 00:54:38,840
Plan A is still very much in motion for many.

742
00:54:38,840 --> 00:54:43,060
Most Marshallese are still at their home, fighting to hold on to their lives as long

743
00:54:43,060 --> 00:54:48,000
as the waters will allow them—those who can buy a few additional years by building

744
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:50,140
a wall between them and the ocean.

745
00:54:50,740 --> 00:54:54,900
Well, we call this, we call this a concrete wall.

746
00:54:54,900 --> 00:55:04,940
So we, first we build the concrete base about five to six feet wide and two feet from the,

747
00:55:04,940 --> 00:55:06,300
from the ground.

748
00:55:06,300 --> 00:55:12,380
When the high tide come, not even normal like other, other dive wounds.

749
00:55:12,380 --> 00:55:18,700
And after I build wall there, people there, they're living happy there.

750
00:55:18,700 --> 00:55:27,860
I see, I see that the seawall has been protecting them, but there's other people, same village.

751
00:55:27,860 --> 00:55:34,980
The other people live on the other side, about two, two houses from the outside of the seawall.

752
00:55:34,980 --> 00:55:37,900
Now they're affecting because there's no wall there.

753
00:55:37,900 --> 00:55:43,740
If wall wasn't here, there's no wall here.

754
00:55:43,780 --> 00:55:51,580
I know that the water, the trash, the rocks, they were coming right here.

755
00:55:51,580 --> 00:55:55,220
They're going, want to, how many houses there?

756
00:55:55,220 --> 00:55:56,220
Yeah.

757
00:55:56,220 --> 00:55:59,540
And it's been happening over, it's been happening over and over.

758
00:55:59,540 --> 00:56:03,300
Every kick tide's coming, they're always like that.

759
00:56:03,300 --> 00:56:06,300
They're bringing rocks and trash.

760
00:56:06,300 --> 00:56:11,540
Do you think seawalls could protect Majuro for 200 years, 300 years?

761
00:56:11,540 --> 00:56:12,540
Oh no.

762
00:56:14,140 --> 00:56:15,140
Don't trust me.

763
00:56:15,140 --> 00:56:20,860
Believe me, even though we're making wall, it's not going to protect because we're damaging

764
00:56:20,860 --> 00:56:21,860
the reef.

765
00:56:21,860 --> 00:56:29,140
And if, as long as you trill the reef and building concrete wall, you're messing with

766
00:56:29,140 --> 00:56:30,820
the mother nature, you know?

767
00:56:30,820 --> 00:56:36,620
At this point, the goal is not to prevent the destruction of the marshals, just to delay

768
00:56:36,620 --> 00:56:37,820
it.

769
00:56:37,900 --> 00:56:44,900
If the time limit is in five years, then, you know, we move five years.

770
00:56:44,900 --> 00:56:51,580
But between now and five years, we want to make sure that we spend every minute thinking

771
00:56:51,580 --> 00:56:55,860
about how to survive on these islands, just like our ancestor did.

772
00:56:55,860 --> 00:56:59,540
Land is supposed to be the embodiment of permanence.

773
00:56:59,540 --> 00:57:05,580
A nation is nothing without its land, but now the Marshall Islands is temporary.

774
00:57:05,580 --> 00:57:10,500
In the back of everyone's mind is the realization that the soil they stand on will eventually

775
00:57:10,500 --> 00:57:11,500
be submerged.

776
00:57:11,500 --> 00:57:15,860
You know, with our infrastructure projects, you know, what are we doing?

777
00:57:15,860 --> 00:57:20,300
Why are we doing this, you know, 20, 30, 40 years?

778
00:57:20,300 --> 00:57:21,740
Could be swamped under water.

779
00:57:21,740 --> 00:57:27,820
I don't know, it's like, you know, part of the work you do is try to prepare for the,

780
00:57:27,820 --> 00:57:32,980
you know, the future of submerging.

781
00:57:32,980 --> 00:57:37,020
And part of it is you just carry on with your day-to-day activities, which means, you know,

782
00:57:37,020 --> 00:57:40,860
look, these projects are still funded, they're on the books, they're approved, we still got

783
00:57:40,860 --> 00:57:42,860
to do them.

784
00:57:42,860 --> 00:57:45,380
Now, when is that going to change?

785
00:57:45,380 --> 00:57:47,500
I don't know.

786
00:57:47,500 --> 00:57:48,500
I don't know.

787
00:57:48,500 --> 00:57:53,700
It's going to take some kind of visible tipping point somewhere then, I think, for that to

788
00:57:53,700 --> 00:57:54,700
happen.

789
00:57:54,700 --> 00:58:00,860
I mean, really, I mean, significant, not just a high king tide, you know, we've had those.

790
00:58:00,860 --> 00:58:01,860
Or another El Nino.

791
00:58:01,860 --> 00:58:02,860
Again, we've had those.

792
00:58:02,860 --> 00:58:10,300
I think it's going to take something else maybe, unfortunately, maybe worse for us to,

793
00:58:10,300 --> 00:58:19,020
I don't know, then get to the realization, well, this is it, you know, we've got to stop

794
00:58:19,020 --> 00:58:27,020
and just have a new web activity and divert the energies into some other kind of future.

795
00:58:27,020 --> 00:58:32,980
Well, when you think, when people say to me that they think the Marshall Islands has

796
00:58:32,980 --> 00:58:38,860
a time limit, I think they have to start thinking about the bigger picture here.

797
00:58:38,860 --> 00:58:41,180
We're the canary in the coal mine.

798
00:58:41,180 --> 00:58:44,820
If we have a limited time here, then so does everywhere else.

799
00:58:44,820 --> 00:58:48,200
I mean, this is the way, this is the way it's evolving.

800
00:58:48,200 --> 00:58:51,020
And so many times we've been the canary out there.

801
00:58:51,020 --> 00:58:55,020
We're the canary in the coal mine for nuclear testing.

802
00:58:55,020 --> 00:58:57,740
Now we're the canary in the coal mine for climate change.

803
00:58:57,740 --> 00:59:06,340
The reason why this, our ocean is mad and is crawling closer to our living room is because

804
00:59:06,340 --> 00:59:11,980
the same people that brought in the nuclear testing to the country are the same people

805
00:59:11,980 --> 00:59:13,580
that are doing this.

806
00:59:13,580 --> 00:59:16,080
They're trying to find resource.

807
00:59:16,080 --> 00:59:21,500
First they tried to find the power to control the world and using our islands to test the

808
00:59:21,500 --> 00:59:23,260
nuclear weapon.

809
00:59:23,260 --> 00:59:29,060
Then they went back and tried to find the best way to gain resources in a short period

810
00:59:29,060 --> 00:59:37,060
of time by using things that would destroy the world and our mother nature is not happy

811
00:59:37,060 --> 00:59:41,280
so she's coming back to us, but in a very roaring way.

812
00:59:41,280 --> 00:59:46,260
We as Marshallese people enter the conversation of climate change as survivors of the nuclear

813
00:59:46,260 --> 00:59:50,420
legacy, as in we already understand what it means to have lost homes, to have lost that

814
00:59:50,420 --> 00:59:55,660
connection to land, to have something ripped away from us for global, because of global

815
00:59:55,660 --> 01:00:00,100
needs and you know, because of a global concern or whatever, right?

816
01:00:00,100 --> 01:00:04,360
The US decided to test nuclear weapons in the Marshall Islands because we were seen

817
01:00:04,360 --> 01:00:09,220
as disposable and now with climate change happening, more or less and less people care

818
01:00:09,220 --> 01:00:10,220
about it.

819
01:00:10,220 --> 01:00:13,900
You know, there are very few people who care about it and the ones in power don't care

820
01:00:13,900 --> 01:00:17,420
about it because again, we're seen as disposable.

821
01:00:17,420 --> 01:00:21,060
That's the intersection between climate change and the nuclear legacy.

822
01:00:21,060 --> 01:00:24,540
We've experienced it already and that's why we're fighting even harder against climate

823
01:00:24,540 --> 01:00:25,540
change.

824
01:00:25,540 --> 01:00:27,060
We don't want to lose the rest of our islands.

825
01:00:27,060 --> 01:00:30,360
We've already experienced that loss and that trauma.

826
01:00:30,360 --> 01:00:33,700
We are going to be the first climate change refugees.

827
01:00:33,700 --> 01:00:36,540
I truly believe that.

828
01:00:36,540 --> 01:00:43,960
That's happening and people are in denial of it because they're responsible for it.

829
01:00:43,960 --> 01:00:46,180
This is my country.

830
01:00:46,180 --> 01:00:47,180
This is where I live.

831
01:00:47,180 --> 01:00:48,820
This is where my kids go to school.

832
01:00:48,820 --> 01:00:54,540
This is where I want them to all be and this is the society I want them to contribute to.

833
01:00:54,540 --> 01:01:00,780
I think it's, you know, it's a tough concept to think about.

834
01:01:00,780 --> 01:01:04,280
It's like thinking, if you have children, thinking about them being in a car accident

835
01:01:04,280 --> 01:01:07,000
or getting a terminal illness.

836
01:01:07,000 --> 01:01:09,420
You don't want to think about it because it's so painful.

837
01:01:09,420 --> 01:01:25,600
You know, we love our culture, we love our custom and we love the way of life that we

838
01:01:25,600 --> 01:01:26,600
have here.

839
01:01:26,600 --> 01:01:32,860
If we were to leave, go somewhere else, we would probably lose our custom, we would probably

840
01:01:32,860 --> 01:01:37,580
lose our ability to look after ourselves as a people.

841
01:01:37,580 --> 01:01:41,400
Right now, it's still a debate in many of these First World nations.

842
01:01:41,400 --> 01:01:42,400
What do we do?

843
01:01:42,400 --> 01:01:43,400
Can we do it?

844
01:01:43,400 --> 01:01:44,780
What are the changes we can make?

845
01:01:44,780 --> 01:01:45,780
Do we believe in it?

846
01:01:45,780 --> 01:01:46,780
Is it even real?

847
01:01:46,780 --> 01:01:48,140
Is it worth the funding?

848
01:01:48,140 --> 01:01:49,140
Can we change?

849
01:01:49,140 --> 01:01:50,140
That's not where we're at.

850
01:01:50,140 --> 01:01:53,040
Where we're at is very much, it's going to happen.

851
01:01:53,040 --> 01:01:55,120
We have to figure out how to plan for it.

852
01:01:55,120 --> 01:02:01,980
We probably will be looking back at our country from a higher ground.

853
01:02:01,980 --> 01:02:09,140
This is going to be, wow, this is going to be something that I just can't describe in

854
01:02:09,140 --> 01:02:18,060
terms of culturally, as a people, civilization, what this is going to mean for the kids and

855
01:02:18,060 --> 01:02:22,500
grandkids.

856
01:02:22,500 --> 01:02:27,740
To be honest, I'm worried about my generation and the next generation and the future on

857
01:02:27,740 --> 01:02:35,940
because when we migrate, the main thing I'm scared of is our culture.

858
01:02:35,940 --> 01:02:38,980
If everyone leaves here, where will our culture go?

859
01:02:38,980 --> 01:02:46,140
Our culture will slowly fade away and no one knows about our culture, our people, and especially

860
01:02:46,140 --> 01:02:47,140
Marshall Islands.

861
01:02:47,140 --> 01:02:56,260
Yeah, it hits me every time, but I really try to ignore it, but I can't because it's

862
01:02:56,260 --> 01:02:57,260
always trending.

863
01:02:57,260 --> 01:03:03,420
It's always getting talked about and we really can't put it aside because we're really affected

864
01:03:03,420 --> 01:03:10,340
now and if we can't do anything now, the future will be affected if we don't do anything now.

865
01:03:10,340 --> 01:03:13,980
Personally, me, I really don't want to go to other countries.

866
01:03:13,980 --> 01:03:21,300
I really want to stay here and live the best life in the islands and really share the full

867
01:03:21,300 --> 01:03:25,680
of joy right here in the Marshall Islands.

868
01:03:25,680 --> 01:03:31,460
This island really means a lot and just imagine if different countries, if we told them that

869
01:03:31,460 --> 01:03:37,180
their country doesn't matter and they can just move here and they would feel the same

870
01:03:37,180 --> 01:03:42,520
way that it feels special for us to have this place because it's unique and our culture

871
01:03:42,520 --> 01:03:53,100
really lies here.

872
01:03:53,100 --> 01:04:01,740
People can move, a nation cannot, and though they'll try, any transposition loses fidelity.

873
01:04:01,740 --> 01:04:07,400
With each generation, the pictures fuzzy, the memories fade.

874
01:04:07,400 --> 01:04:12,980
The Marshall Islands has endured for millennia, but it was never immortal.

875
01:04:12,980 --> 01:04:17,300
Nations have ended before, nations will end again.

876
01:04:17,300 --> 01:04:22,800
Of all the ends the Marshall Islands could meet, though, this one stings most.

877
01:04:22,800 --> 01:04:30,480
To be killed by the ocean, its creator, turned against it by people who don't even know its name.

878
01:04:52,800 --> 01:04:59,800
You're not alone, you're not alone, you're not alone, you're not alone, you're not alone, you're not alone.

879
01:05:22,800 --> 01:05:24,860
you
