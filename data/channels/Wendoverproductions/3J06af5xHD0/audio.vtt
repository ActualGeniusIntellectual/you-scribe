00:00.000 --> 00:04.940
The documentary you're about to watch is a Nebula original—that means it was funded

00:04.940 --> 00:08.580
by and released on the streaming platform Nebula first.

00:08.580 --> 00:12.700
We thought, though, that this one in particular would be important to get out to the widest

00:12.700 --> 00:16.260
audience possible given how important the subject matter is.

00:16.260 --> 00:20.860
It is, though, going to be one of the last Nebula originals uploaded to YouTube as we're

00:20.860 --> 00:21.860
phasing that out.

00:21.860 --> 00:26.340
I hope this serves as evidence for you on just how high-quality the content on Nebula

00:26.340 --> 00:32.480
is, and, each week, new originals come out from some of the top educational content creators.

00:32.480 --> 00:36.820
If you want to see more, Nebula is available through a bundle deal with CuriosityStream

00:36.820 --> 00:41.860
for just $15 a year at their current sale pricing, and that's available only by going

00:41.860 --> 00:45.580
to CuriosityStream.com slash Wendover.

00:45.580 --> 00:47.560
Now to the Marshall Islands.

00:56.340 --> 01:21.820
The legend in Marshall's eyes is that the Marshall Islands were created by a cart.

01:21.820 --> 01:23.380
His name was Lawa.

01:23.380 --> 01:31.540
He descended on the atoll of island Lawa, and he created the islands by saying Lawa

01:31.540 --> 01:37.660
and islands, and they were islands, Lawa and people, and they were people, Lawa and fish,

01:37.660 --> 01:42.060
and they were fish, and on and on like that.

01:42.060 --> 01:48.780
Our lands, you know, like our mothers, you know, they provide for everything, and our

01:48.780 --> 01:49.780
oceans, same thing.

01:49.780 --> 01:55.660
We've always thought about the ocean as our friends, but now it's becoming a threat

01:55.660 --> 01:58.860
to us.

01:58.860 --> 02:04.260
You know when you find a globe, and you give it a whirl, and it goes around and around

02:04.260 --> 02:09.180
and around, and then as the going slows, your eyes come to a rest on a dash of color that

02:09.180 --> 02:13.900
has never caught your attention before—a spot that sits on the part of the sphere you

02:13.900 --> 02:16.400
normally spin right past.

02:16.400 --> 02:21.920
An island so isolated that you're not even sure how you'd explain where it is—somewhere

02:21.920 --> 02:27.560
whose story is seen as insignificant, a land that's lost to most of the world, left out

02:27.560 --> 02:31.320
of the history books apart from a passing mention.

02:31.320 --> 02:36.280
That place is here—the Republic of the Marshall Islands.

02:36.280 --> 02:39.980
But unknown, untold, unremembered places aren't unique.

02:39.980 --> 02:44.760
What makes the Marshall Islands story singular is not that it's unrecognized from above,

02:44.760 --> 02:49.240
but because it's under siege, from below, and it's only when you see it from the middle

02:49.240 --> 02:51.880
that you can understand why.

02:51.880 --> 02:56.360
Go on, take a look, you won't have the chance for long.

02:56.360 --> 02:59.840
We can talk more about the end of their world later, but first I've got to tell you about

02:59.840 --> 03:00.840
what we've got here.

03:00.840 --> 03:05.240
It's a small nation, the Marshall Islands, with a bit over 50,000 residents and 70 square

03:05.240 --> 03:11.000
miles of land, split up into 29 atolls—thin rings of land encircling saltwater lagoons.

03:11.000 --> 03:15.860
While significant populations can be found on 13 of those atolls, over half of the Marshallese

03:15.860 --> 03:19.180
people can be found on this one, Majuro.

03:19.180 --> 03:25.040
About 28,000 people live on the capital atoll, and none of those 28,000 live more than a

03:25.040 --> 03:27.160
few minutes' walk from the ocean.

03:27.160 --> 03:32.080
The furthest you can get from the water is about 2,000 feet or 600 meters inland, but

03:32.080 --> 03:37.440
that's an anomaly—in most spots, water flanks you closely on both sides.

03:37.440 --> 03:42.480
In some spots, the atoll gets so thin that you could stand in the lagoon and have a conversation

03:42.480 --> 03:45.280
with someone standing in the ocean.

03:45.280 --> 03:51.320
Life on a remote, sunny coral atoll may sound idyllic, but the population density of Majuro,

03:51.320 --> 03:56.840
greater than that of Bahrain, Bermuda, or Bangladesh, has not been kind to the mother

03:56.840 --> 03:57.840
atoll.

03:57.840 --> 04:02.120
In a part of the world usually thought of as pristine, sparse, and pastoral, Majuro

04:02.120 --> 04:05.400
is instead gritty, overcrowded, and urbanized.

04:05.400 --> 04:09.520
But it's far from an island paradise.

04:09.520 --> 04:14.840
Based on the 2011 census, which was the last census we had, average household size on Majuro

04:14.840 --> 04:21.520
was about seven people, and household income is probably about $16,000 in that neighborhood.

04:21.520 --> 04:30.120
Well, I mean, $16,000 divided by seven, you know, it can be, that can be a challenge,

04:30.120 --> 04:31.120
that can be tough.

04:31.120 --> 04:32.800
Here's the problem.

04:32.800 --> 04:36.800
Some places are poor because they haven't yet seized their opportunity.

04:36.800 --> 04:40.120
Others are poor because they have no opportunity.

04:40.120 --> 04:43.600
Majuro is in that second category.

04:43.600 --> 04:47.840
Characteristics of the economy here in the islands is, you know, you're looking at

04:47.840 --> 04:50.040
fish, coconuts, people.

04:50.040 --> 04:54.920
I mean, outside of that, our natural resources are fairly scarce.

04:54.920 --> 05:00.720
And then combined with our challenges with education and skills attainment makes it even

05:00.720 --> 05:05.200
more challenging with people being our third largest natural resource.

05:05.200 --> 05:11.760
Those are some major inhibitors for, you know, sustaining economic growth, expanding the

05:11.760 --> 05:13.940
economy here in the islands.

05:13.940 --> 05:17.880
Like many small island nations, the Marshall Islands doesn't have too much in the way

05:17.880 --> 05:22.360
of natural resources worth exporting, and even when it does manage to produce something

05:22.360 --> 05:26.840
people might want to buy, the cost of shipping it to those potential buyers will have pumped

05:26.840 --> 05:30.580
up the price so much that it's no longer worth it.

05:30.580 --> 05:34.880
One of the very few things they make decent business of selling abroad is copra, or dried

05:34.880 --> 05:39.100
coconut meat, which is produced mainly on outer atolls and then brought into Majuro

05:39.100 --> 05:40.100
for processing.

05:40.100 --> 05:44.840
It's a work-intensive process mostly conducted by families who form informal assembly lines

05:44.840 --> 05:49.620
getting paid 50 cents a pound, and even that low wage is the result of heavy government

05:49.620 --> 05:51.600
subsidies.

05:51.600 --> 05:56.120
Because creating viable export goods is so difficult, most of the jobs in the Marshall

05:56.120 --> 05:59.060
Islands are either in government or the subsistence economy.

05:59.060 --> 06:03.100
In other words, most people in the Marshall Islands are providing services or making goods

06:03.100 --> 06:08.340
exclusively for the Marshall Islands, which leaves very little opportunity for growth.

06:08.340 --> 06:14.060
But the country does have one tiny little asset that keeps it running—its location.

06:14.060 --> 06:18.300
A location that makes the Marshall Islands attractive to one of the world's biggest

06:18.300 --> 06:22.020
businesses—the US military.

06:22.020 --> 06:26.340
The American military presence can be found mainly on Kwajalein Atoll, which serves as

06:26.340 --> 06:31.060
a key test site for the US ballistic missile defense system, among other purposes.

06:31.060 --> 06:35.340
In the end, it's simple logic—the US military wants access to the Marshall Islands, the

06:35.340 --> 06:40.540
Marshall Islands wants money and security, and thus, an agreement exists—the Compact

06:40.540 --> 06:41.540
of Free Association.

06:41.540 --> 06:48.300
So, the Compact of Free Association basically lays the foundation for the relationship between

06:48.300 --> 06:52.340
the United States and the freely associated states.

06:52.340 --> 06:57.680
One section of the Compact deals with the relationship between our peoples, and it allows

06:57.680 --> 07:05.780
for qualified citizens to live and work and study in the United States without a visa.

07:05.780 --> 07:10.740
There's another section of the Compact that generally governs economics, and it provides

07:10.740 --> 07:18.220
for grants and services, all kinds of USG assistance coming to the Marshall Islands.

07:18.220 --> 07:22.980
The third big section of the Compact has to do with security provisions.

07:22.980 --> 07:26.460
The United States is the guarantor of security in the Marshall Islands.

07:26.460 --> 07:29.820
It's difficult to overstate the significance of the Compact.

07:29.820 --> 07:34.780
It's the basis of the entire modern economic and political system of the Marshals, and

07:34.780 --> 07:39.420
while each of the three sections has an enormous impact on the country, perhaps none is more

07:39.420 --> 07:43.640
consequential than the second—financial aid.

07:43.640 --> 07:51.960
The Marshals are heavily dependent on money from donors or from the United States.

07:51.960 --> 07:58.980
That's a tremendous part of the national income—upward 70-80%.

07:58.980 --> 08:04.240
The US provides approximately $100 million every year to the RMI as a combination of

08:04.240 --> 08:06.240
grants and services and programs.

08:06.240 --> 08:11.360
Now, it's a big world out there, and there are quite a few places the US could send $100

08:11.360 --> 08:14.320
million a year in exchange for military access.

08:14.320 --> 08:15.420
So why here?

08:15.420 --> 08:19.760
Why is there this strange partnership between one of the world's largest superpowers and

08:19.760 --> 08:22.120
one of the world's smallest countries?

08:22.120 --> 08:27.440
Well, like most strange things, it came as a result of millions of years of chance and

08:27.440 --> 08:28.960
circumstance.

08:28.960 --> 08:34.580
About 70 million years ago, 29 ancient volcanoes in what we now call the North Pacific came

08:34.580 --> 08:39.760
to life and spewed out lava which quickly cooled and built up into under-ocean volcanic

08:39.760 --> 08:45.680
structures until they grew so much that they emerged above water and became islands.

08:45.680 --> 08:49.520
Around these islands, coral began to form, eventually coalescing into what's known

08:49.520 --> 08:53.700
as a fringing coral reef, which encircled each island.

08:53.700 --> 08:58.000
Time went on, the dinosaurs ruled and then died or became birds, and mammals started

08:58.000 --> 09:02.600
mattering and so on and so on, and as that all happened, those islands were slowly eroding

09:02.600 --> 09:06.400
and undergoing subsidence—they slowly sunk into the sea.

09:06.400 --> 09:10.160
Eventually, the islands disappeared under the ocean, but the coral reefs that had formed

09:10.160 --> 09:12.360
around them remained.

09:12.360 --> 09:17.680
It is these 29 rings of coral, called atolls, that make up what's now known as the Marshall

09:17.680 --> 09:18.680
Islands.

09:18.680 --> 09:23.000
Sometime, millions of years later, but 4,000 years before today, the first Marshallese

09:23.000 --> 09:27.740
settlers arrived on the islands, coming from either here, here, here, or here, or some

09:27.740 --> 09:29.560
combination of those places.

09:29.560 --> 09:34.180
They split the atolls into two chains—the eastern relic, or sunrise chain, and the western

09:34.180 --> 09:35.980
rata, or sunset chain.

09:35.980 --> 09:40.220
From those early Marshallese, eight clans emerged, of which four became dominant.

09:40.220 --> 09:44.300
The Chiti conquered northern Ralic, the Arab Rajoy took southern Ralic, and the Rumiore

09:44.300 --> 09:48.220
clan conquered nearly all of Ratak, but then gave nearly all of it to their offspring,

09:48.220 --> 09:49.660
of the Rano clan.

09:49.660 --> 09:54.180
These early Marshallese wore traditional clothing, which looked like this, lived in large community-based

09:54.180 --> 09:58.180
homes, which looked like this, and practiced a religion that involved complex dances and

09:58.180 --> 10:00.800
tattoos, which looked like this.

10:00.800 --> 10:04.740
The first western explorers to find the Marshall Islands were Spaniards, and there were a few

10:04.740 --> 10:05.740
of them.

10:05.740 --> 10:11.900
The first one was this guy in 1526, then this guy in 1529, and then this guy in 1530.

10:11.900 --> 10:16.580
Over the next 300 years, more explorers stopped through the Marshalls, including Frenchmen,

10:16.580 --> 10:21.660
Russians, and this guy, British captain John Charles Marshall in 1788, after whom the islands

10:21.660 --> 10:23.620
were named on western maps.

10:23.620 --> 10:27.660
Technically, during this time, the Spanish claimed sovereignty over the Marshall Islands

10:27.660 --> 10:32.060
as part of the Spanish East Indies, which included all of this, but that claim was largely

10:32.060 --> 10:33.640
just theoretical.

10:33.640 --> 10:38.200
The Spanish never had a formal administration, never tried to exert influence, and never

10:38.200 --> 10:42.340
really even visited apart from those early explorers, whose only real impact had been

10:42.340 --> 10:45.380
giving the Marshallese European diseases.

10:45.380 --> 10:49.880
Much more relevant to the actual history of the Marshalls was the presence of these people,

10:49.880 --> 10:54.280
Boston missionaries who first arrived in 1857 aboard the Morning Star.

10:54.280 --> 11:00.320
They landed here, on Ebon Atoll, and were met by Chief Kabua, whose great-great-some-number-of-greats

11:00.320 --> 11:04.560
grandson was the first president of the Marshall Islands, and whose some-greater-number-of-greats

11:04.560 --> 11:06.840
grandson is the current president.

11:06.840 --> 11:10.540
Chief Kabua allowed the missionaries to stay there, where they began spreading Christianity

11:10.540 --> 11:12.040
throughout the islands.

11:12.040 --> 11:15.960
Not only were they teaching them about this guy in this book, they also actively changed

11:15.960 --> 11:20.140
Marshallese culture, even going so far as to ban traditional tattooing and dancing because

11:20.140 --> 11:23.240
they referenced the traditional Marshallese religion.

11:23.240 --> 11:28.120
Soon, the Marshall Islands changed even more as the first genuine western settlers, the

11:28.120 --> 11:31.460
Germans, began to make residence in the islands.

11:31.460 --> 11:35.720
In 1875, they signed a treaty of friendship with Chief Kabua, and developed a consulate,

11:35.720 --> 11:40.160
trading posts, and economic ties, eventually buying the Marshalls from Spain in 1885, the

11:40.160 --> 11:43.480
same year they worked with Chief Kabua to make the Marshall Islands an official German

11:43.480 --> 11:44.480
protectorate.

11:44.480 --> 11:49.860
Also, importantly, they brought in more missionaries who spread even more Christianity.

11:49.860 --> 11:55.240
But then, in 1914, the Germans decided to invade here, which led to here invading here,

11:55.240 --> 11:58.920
and then here invading here, and then here invading here, and then here invading here,

11:58.920 --> 12:03.560
and also, not that many people paid attention to it, the Japanese invading here—the Marshall

12:03.560 --> 12:05.240
Islands.

12:05.240 --> 12:10.420
Japan took the Marshalls in part for strategic reasons, in part for economic reasons.

12:10.420 --> 12:16.000
After all, even in the final years of German rule, they controlled over 80% of the island's

12:16.000 --> 12:17.000
trade.

12:17.000 --> 12:20.780
Once World War I ended and all these people got together to sign the Treaty of Versailles,

12:20.780 --> 12:25.040
the Council of the League of Nations gave control of the Marshall Islands to the Japanese.

12:25.040 --> 12:29.600
While in power, they expanded their administration, introduced Japanese culture, and moved about

12:29.600 --> 12:31.920
1,000 Japanese citizens to the islands.

12:31.920 --> 12:36.880
But then, because of some things going on here and here and also here, the Japanese

12:36.880 --> 12:41.040
decided to drop bombs here, which led to the United States entering World War II and eventually

12:41.040 --> 12:44.640
taking the Marshalls from the Japanese in 1944.

12:44.640 --> 12:46.640
And then came this.

12:55.040 --> 13:04.860
When the United States dropped atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, it began a new

13:04.860 --> 13:09.600
chapter in the world's history—the nuclear age.

13:09.600 --> 13:14.080
These atomic footprints on the sands of time can never be erased.

13:14.080 --> 13:21.120
They point a path which leads to unparalleled progress, or unparalleled destruction.

13:21.120 --> 13:27.280
Just as in the darkness of the desert morning, when the atomic age was born, atomic power

13:27.280 --> 13:37.720
puts the question squarely to mankind.

13:37.720 --> 13:39.160
For some, it was exciting.

13:39.160 --> 13:43.660
There were mushroom cloud cakes, misatomic beauty pageants, and talk of unlimited clean

13:43.660 --> 13:48.200
energy, unparalleled military dominance, and an everlasting world peace.

13:48.200 --> 13:59.280
But of course, the enduring legacy of nuclear weapons is not peace or energy, but destruction.

13:59.280 --> 14:03.560
And while what happened in Hiroshima and Nagasaki can be found in any book of modern history,

14:03.560 --> 14:09.640
there's another chapter of the nuclear story that's told far less often—that of the

14:09.640 --> 14:11.360
Marshall Islands.

14:11.360 --> 14:17.760
So what happened at the end of World War II was, there had already been three nuclear

14:17.760 --> 14:23.100
weapons detonated—one in New Mexico and then Hiroshima and Nagasaki.

14:23.100 --> 14:28.460
But the United States at that time—not just the United States, the Russians too—they

14:28.460 --> 14:34.360
wanted to increase their knowledge about the nuclear testing.

14:34.360 --> 14:38.860
And so they needed a testing ground, and when they looked around the globe, they needed

14:38.860 --> 14:44.060
several requirements for a proving ground for their nuclear testing.

14:44.060 --> 14:48.820
Had to be out of the way of major airline and shipping routes, had to be under the control

14:48.820 --> 14:57.140
of the United States, had to have a really wide area, a lagoon, to anchor the ships to

14:57.140 --> 14:59.780
do the testing with—somewhere really far out of the way.

14:59.780 --> 15:03.620
They looked around the map and they saw Bikini.

15:03.620 --> 15:08.420
Bikini Atoll sits at the northern end of the relic chain—2.3 square miles of land encircling

15:08.460 --> 15:10.980
a 229 square mile lagoon.

15:10.980 --> 15:15.440
It was perfect—the right size, the right shape, the right location, and the right political

15:15.440 --> 15:19.460
status as the US had been given jurisdiction over the Marshall Islands at the end of the

15:19.460 --> 15:20.460
war.

15:20.460 --> 15:27.020
And so, on to tiny Bikini Atoll, the United States moved in 42,000 personnel on 242 ships

15:27.020 --> 15:31.540
and began to experiment with the greatest power ever unleashed by mankind.

15:31.540 --> 15:37.420
First, there was the Crossroads Able Bomb—21 kilotons, far greater than Little Boy, the

15:37.420 --> 15:40.220
15 kiloton bomb dropped on Hiroshima.

15:40.220 --> 15:46.860
Then Crossroads Baker—23 kilotons, but these were nothing compared to what came next.

15:46.860 --> 15:54.140
Castle Bravo.

15:54.140 --> 16:00.180
Detonated on March 1st, 1954, this bomb produced the most powerful explosion the world had

16:00.180 --> 16:06.700
ever seen—15 megatons—1,000 times more powerful than the Hiroshima bomb.

16:06.700 --> 16:12.420
The United States was a triumph—the greatest example yet of nuclear technology's potential.

16:12.420 --> 16:18.660
For Nerje Joseph, a neighboring Rangalap atoll, it was the start of a long nightmare.

16:18.660 --> 16:20.700
My name is Nerje Joseph.

16:20.700 --> 16:22.100
I come from Rangalap.

16:22.100 --> 16:28.700
When I was born in Rangalap, I was in Rangalap in 1954.

16:28.700 --> 16:30.860
The nuclear company.

16:30.860 --> 16:33.540
Nerje was only eight on Bravo Day.

16:33.540 --> 16:37.260
Today, at 74, she still remembers it vividly.

17:03.540 --> 17:33.220
The powder, of course, was nuclear fallout.

17:33.220 --> 17:37.500
Most pieces of coral laced with radiation had been shot up into the air and carried

17:37.500 --> 17:38.900
by wind onto Rangalap.

17:38.900 --> 17:42.340
But the people of Rangalap had no idea what it was.

17:42.340 --> 17:46.380
Some of the kids even stuck their tongues out and let it fall into their mouths, thinking

17:46.380 --> 17:48.020
it was snow.

17:48.020 --> 17:52.980
Despite the enormous danger posed to the people of Rangalap, the US didn't evacuate them

17:52.980 --> 17:54.860
for two days.

17:54.860 --> 17:59.100
By that time, the radiation sickness had started to take hold.

17:59.100 --> 18:02.940
The people of Rangalap had no idea what it was.

18:02.940 --> 18:05.940
The people of Rangalap had no idea what it was.

18:05.940 --> 18:07.940
The people of Rangalap had no idea what it was.

18:07.940 --> 18:09.940
The people of Rangalap had no idea what it was.

18:09.940 --> 18:11.940
The people of Rangalap had no idea what it was.

18:11.940 --> 18:13.940
The people of Rangalap had no idea what it was.

18:13.940 --> 18:15.940
The people of Rangalap had no idea what it was.

18:15.940 --> 18:17.940
The people of Rangalap had no idea what it was.

18:17.940 --> 18:19.940
The people of Rangalap had no idea what it was.

18:19.940 --> 18:21.940
The people of Rangalap had no idea what it was.

18:21.940 --> 18:23.940
The people of Rangalap had no idea what it was.

18:23.940 --> 18:25.940
The people of Rangalap had no idea what it was.

18:26.780 --> 18:28.780
The people of Rangalap had no idea what it was.

18:28.780 --> 18:30.780
The people of Rangalap had no idea what it was.

18:30.780 --> 18:32.780
The people of Rangalap had no idea what it was.

18:32.780 --> 18:34.780
The people of Rangalap had no idea what it was.

18:34.780 --> 18:36.780
The people of Rangalap had no idea what it was.

18:36.780 --> 18:38.780
Of the hundreds of people on Rangalap that day,

18:38.780 --> 18:42.780
Nirje is one of just ten who are still alive.

18:42.780 --> 18:44.780
No one on Rangalap died that day,

18:44.780 --> 18:46.780
but that doesn't mean the bomb didn't kill them.

18:46.780 --> 18:48.780
Many fell victim to thyroid cancer

18:48.780 --> 18:50.780
which has been linked to the fallout from Bravo

18:50.780 --> 18:53.780
and none have been able to return to their home.

18:54.780 --> 18:55.780
I…

18:55.780 --> 19:07.180
The collateral damage of nuclear testing isn't

19:07.180 --> 19:09.100
limited only to the people of Rongelao.

19:09.100 --> 19:14.140
There's another group of victims, whose pain began before a single bomb was detonated—the

19:14.140 --> 19:17.620
167 inhabitants of Bikini Atoll.

19:17.620 --> 19:22.100
To the United States, once they'd identified Bikini as a suitable test site, its people

19:22.100 --> 19:25.340
were more of an afterthought than an obstacle.

19:25.340 --> 19:29.960
They asked them if they'd be willing to move for the good of mankind and to end all

19:29.960 --> 19:35.340
world wars, and Judah, the leader of the Bikinians, just kept standing up and saying the same

19:35.340 --> 19:36.340
answer every time.

19:36.340 --> 19:41.140
He said, minu teimdei drudigo bienas, which is, everything's in the hands of God.

19:41.140 --> 19:45.660
If you know what I know about Marshallese culture, if someone said to me, if I asked

19:45.660 --> 19:49.500
them if I could do something, they said, everything's in the hands of God, that's about as much

19:49.500 --> 19:51.740
as a no as you're ever going to get.

19:51.740 --> 19:52.740
It's in the hands of God.

19:52.740 --> 19:54.900
You better be careful.

19:54.900 --> 19:59.620
But if you watch, they did 26 takes of this same shot.

19:59.620 --> 20:03.640
The Commodore stands up and dusts off his pants and in the end he says, well, everything

20:03.640 --> 20:07.180
being in the hands of God, it cannot be other than good.

20:07.180 --> 20:08.180
And off he walks.

20:08.180 --> 20:14.300
Well, you tell them and King Judah that everything being in God's hands, it cannot be other

20:14.300 --> 20:17.180
than good.

20:17.180 --> 20:21.180
With that, the people of Bikini were evacuated, and while they were told, of course, that

20:21.180 --> 20:25.740
they would one day be able to return to their homes, that, like so many things the Marshalls

20:25.740 --> 20:29.460
were told as nuclear testing began, was a lie.

20:29.460 --> 20:33.940
After they were evacuated, the Bikinians underwent a grueling saga placed by the United States

20:33.940 --> 20:39.260
here on uninhabited Rongorik Atoll, which they soon discovered had toxic fish and land

20:39.260 --> 20:40.940
where nothing grew.

20:40.940 --> 20:45.820
But I think the US looked at Rongorik and looked at Bikini, palm trees, sand, beach,

20:45.820 --> 20:47.940
looks the same, you'll just go there.

20:47.940 --> 20:50.940
And they drop them off there, the Bikinians, and they starve.

20:50.940 --> 20:55.140
After two years, they were moved to tents here at Kwajalein Base, then finally here

20:55.140 --> 21:00.380
to Kili Island, and meanwhile, with each bomb the Americans detonated, more and more of

21:00.380 --> 21:02.740
the Bikinians' land was vaporized.

21:02.740 --> 21:07.420
The little that remained was laced with nuclear radiation that wouldn't dissipate for thousands

21:07.420 --> 21:08.420
of years.

21:08.420 --> 21:15.340
In late 1960s, President Johnson, on the front page of the New York Times, on a Sunday edition,

21:15.340 --> 21:19.920
said that Bikini was now safe on recommendations from the Atomic Energy Commission that everybody

21:19.920 --> 21:20.920
could go back.

21:20.920 --> 21:26.240
While they were skeptical, many were so desperate to return home that they went, choosing to

21:26.240 --> 21:28.080
trust the Americans.

21:28.080 --> 21:32.700
Perhaps unsurprisingly, that trust was not rewarded.

21:32.700 --> 21:38.520
And after about eight or nine years, they discovered that the people were ingesting

21:38.520 --> 21:43.880
the food grown on the island, and the cesium-137 radioactive element was going up into the

21:43.880 --> 21:48.180
crops and they were eating this, so it was discovered in the late 70s that they had these

21:48.180 --> 21:52.900
very high body versions of cesium-137, so they moved them off again and they haven't

21:52.900 --> 21:53.900
been back since.

21:53.900 --> 22:00.120
In the end, the United States dropped 67 nuclear bombs on the Marshall Islands.

22:00.120 --> 22:05.180
Still today, many parts of the country show radiation levels that far exceed those of

22:05.180 --> 22:07.420
Chernobyl.

22:07.420 --> 22:13.400
It was really, the Cold War was fought and won by the United States on the shores of

22:13.400 --> 22:15.560
Bikini and Eniwetok and the Marshall Islands.

22:15.560 --> 22:20.720
We really gave a lot to the United States and the idea that it's not even talked about

22:20.720 --> 22:30.000
is really kind of, for lack of a better word, I would say it's insulting.

22:30.000 --> 22:34.280
As the Marshall Islands struggles to lift itself from the crater of nuclear testing,

22:34.280 --> 22:43.720
a new threat looms—one whose capacity for destruction dwarfs that of an atomic warhead—water.

22:43.740 --> 22:51.100
Recall for a moment the attributes of an atoll—comprised of coral, small in size, and notably narrow.

22:51.100 --> 22:57.580
Now add to that mental picture two more tragic geological truths—atolls are extraordinarily

22:57.580 --> 23:04.280
low-lying and exceedingly flat, which is to say, by their very nature, atolls are uniquely,

23:04.280 --> 23:10.440
acutely susceptible to the deadly power of a rising sea.

23:10.440 --> 23:18.480
The implications are dire for this atoll nation and similar atoll nations.

23:18.480 --> 23:22.840
Most of the atolls of the Marshall Islands sit at less than six feet above sea level.

23:22.840 --> 23:29.840
Marshallese homes, businesses, streets, people sit at less than six feet above sea level.

23:29.840 --> 23:36.240
As temperatures rise and seize with them, that six feet begins to disappear fast.

23:36.240 --> 23:45.840
Imagine an aircraft carrier that has a freeboard of perhaps, I don't know, 150 feet.

23:45.840 --> 23:56.520
But if you lowered that freeboard to six feet and sea level rose seven feet, well, the picture

23:56.520 --> 24:04.720
is pretty plain for anyone to imagine, and that's precisely what is predicted to happen

24:04.720 --> 24:08.240
and what is happening gradually for atolls.

24:08.240 --> 24:15.360
It's not just erosion, but there's actual land loss, submergence, but also the deprivation

24:15.360 --> 24:22.520
of the use of land for any viable purpose, including simply to live on.

24:22.520 --> 24:31.520
People who have not visited an atoll have really no concept of what it means not to

24:31.520 --> 24:36.560
have land in an oceanic expanse as vast as the Pacific.

24:36.560 --> 24:41.480
So any loss in land is dire.

24:41.480 --> 24:52.960
Thirty feet of land on a high island is still significant, but 30 feet of land loss or unavailability

24:52.960 --> 24:59.480
of land for living on is a tragedy on an atoll.

25:01.520 --> 25:06.480
For the Marshallese, land loss isn't just devastating from a scientific perspective—it's

25:06.480 --> 25:10.040
corrosive to the fundamental tenets of their culture.

25:10.040 --> 25:14.540
While nearly all societies prize land, in the Marshall Islands, the relationship between

25:14.540 --> 25:18.440
its people and land is especially precious.

25:18.440 --> 25:22.080
You have to understand that every Marshallese is attached to a piece of land.

25:22.080 --> 25:26.360
My kids all have, they know where their pieces of land are on Bikini, and that's their

25:26.360 --> 25:29.840
gift from God, and that's like their anchor in life.

25:29.840 --> 25:34.360
Marshallese people have a connection to land, not just the land but the ocean, right?

25:34.360 --> 25:36.140
We have a connection to place.

25:36.140 --> 25:39.820
Everybody owns land in the Marshalls, but not just that.

25:39.820 --> 25:48.460
Every piece of land has some story, some marking, some name that's ancient, that's deep.

25:48.460 --> 25:54.680
What happens to that knowledge if you lose that land, if you lose that connection?

25:54.680 --> 25:58.400
What happens to who you are as a person, to our identity?

25:58.400 --> 26:03.640
But the Marshallese, the people who settled distant atolls, who navigated through an unforgiving

26:03.640 --> 26:09.480
sea, who endured colonization, disease, war, and 63 nuclear bombs, refused to allow their

26:09.480 --> 26:12.680
ocean to be turned into a weapon against them.

26:12.680 --> 26:16.400
And so, they decided to fight back, but they couldn't do it alone.

26:16.400 --> 26:22.040
At the end of the day, Marshall Islands contributes .00001% of the world's global emissions.

26:22.040 --> 26:27.040
It could be the most solarized island on the planet, and it would still go underwater if

26:27.040 --> 26:31.980
the rest of the world doesn't take it into consideration and make changes, right?

26:31.980 --> 26:34.280
So we have to fight on a global level.

26:34.280 --> 26:38.520
What the Marshallese, through their climate activism, are fighting to defend is complex

26:38.520 --> 26:45.080
and multifaceted—a combination of culture, tradition, soil, coral, homes, language, history,

26:45.080 --> 26:46.080
and people.

26:46.080 --> 26:50.720
Yet what they hope to achieve can be condensed to a single number—1.5.

26:50.720 --> 26:56.080
1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels.

26:56.120 --> 27:01.240
That's the magic number for the Marshallese—the limit for how much the earth can warm before

27:01.240 --> 27:05.020
their island home becomes uninhabitable.

27:05.020 --> 27:09.240
If global temperatures creep above 1.5, it's lights out.

27:09.240 --> 27:11.040
Streets and houses flood.

27:11.040 --> 27:12.440
Land disappears.

27:12.440 --> 27:14.200
Crops die.

27:14.200 --> 27:20.360
Above 1.5, the atolls which, for thousands of years, have supported life, transform into

27:20.360 --> 27:22.960
engines of death.

27:22.960 --> 27:29.040
Mitigating climate change in any meaningful way is already a nearly insurmountable endeavor—limiting

27:29.040 --> 27:32.300
it to 1.5 would be next to impossible.

27:32.300 --> 27:35.920
The Marshallese would face opposition from not only governments and industry, but also

27:35.920 --> 27:41.540
from other climate change activists whose focus had long been on a different number—2.

27:41.540 --> 27:46.520
Limiting temperature rise to 2 degrees above pre-industrial levels had, for many years,

27:46.520 --> 27:51.040
been the aim of policy, the object of studies, and the goal of activists.

27:51.040 --> 27:56.220
In the mainstream climate change debate, 2 wasn't the backup, the worst-case scenario,

27:56.220 --> 27:57.220
the not-too-bad.

27:57.220 --> 28:01.720
2 was seen as the ideal, the ambition, the gold standard.

28:01.720 --> 28:05.800
1.5, on the other hand, was to many a pipe dream.

28:05.800 --> 28:10.680
It was called unrealistic, impossible, a distraction, but the Marshallese knew that it was the only

28:10.680 --> 28:13.320
way for their atolls to survive.

28:13.320 --> 28:18.760
And it was not just the Marshalls—above 1.5, atoll nations like Tuvalu, the Maldives,

28:18.760 --> 28:21.760
and Kiribati would face the same fate.

28:21.760 --> 28:29.120
Among these most vulnerable countries, a motto soon emerged—1.5 to stay alive.

28:29.120 --> 28:34.560
The fight for 1.5 would be far from easy, but they knew where it would have to be won—the

28:34.560 --> 28:40.440
2015 United Nations Climate Change Conference in Paris, where 196 countries would come together

28:40.440 --> 28:44.040
to develop a global plan for combating global warming.

28:44.040 --> 28:48.560
But, before they could do that, they had to build influence.

28:48.560 --> 28:53.120
A Marshallese government minister named Tony de Broom started building relationships and

28:53.120 --> 28:57.400
rallying support around the world making a name for the small Marshall Islands in the

28:57.400 --> 29:00.040
big world of climate change activism.

29:00.040 --> 29:04.720
He represented the Marshalls at conferences and meetings all over the world—in Copenhagen,

29:04.720 --> 29:09.400
in Doha, in Warsaw, in Lima—joining with other countries as part of the Alliance of

29:09.400 --> 29:11.340
Small Island States.

29:11.340 --> 29:15.380
And while de Broom made impressive progress, when it comes to geopolitics, there's only

29:15.380 --> 29:19.860
so much influence and power that can be amassed by an atoll nation with a population lower

29:19.860 --> 29:21.580
than most small cities.

29:21.580 --> 29:27.260
So, he began work on a new coalition—one that could emerge at Paris to force the conversation

29:27.260 --> 29:30.800
to 1.5—but it needed a spark.

29:30.800 --> 29:35.900
In September 2014, that spark came, when the UN Climate Summit invited Marshallese poet

29:35.900 --> 29:39.240
Kathy Jettnall-Kishner to speak at their opening ceremony.

29:39.240 --> 29:43.940
With the entire nation on her shoulders, she read to the gathered leaders of the world

29:43.940 --> 29:46.860
a letter she had written to her newborn daughter.

30:14.660 --> 30:19.680
Dear Mata Felipe, I want to tell you about that lagoon.

30:19.680 --> 30:23.340
That lazy lounging lagoon lounging against the sunrise.

30:23.340 --> 30:27.840
Men say that one day that lagoon will devour you.

30:27.840 --> 30:32.180
They say it will gnaw at the shoreline, chew at the roots of your red fruit trees, gulp

30:32.180 --> 30:36.980
down rows of seawalls, and crunch through your island's shattered bones.

30:37.020 --> 30:44.660
They say you, your daughter, and your granddaughter, too, will wander, ruthless, with only a passport

30:44.660 --> 30:46.900
to call home.

30:46.900 --> 30:50.140
Dear Mata Felipe, don't cry.

30:50.140 --> 30:52.220
No one's drowning, baby.

30:52.220 --> 30:53.680
No one's moving.

30:53.680 --> 30:55.820
No one's losing their homeland.

30:55.820 --> 31:00.300
No one's becoming a climate change refugee.

31:00.300 --> 31:03.940
Or should I say, no one else.

31:03.940 --> 31:09.220
To the Carteret Islanders of Papua New Guinea and to the Tarot Islanders of Fiji, I take

31:09.220 --> 31:12.520
this moment to apologize to you.

31:12.520 --> 31:17.720
We are drawing the line here because we, baby, are going to fight.

31:17.720 --> 31:23.500
Your mommy, daddy, boo-boo, Jima, your country, and your president, too, we will all fight.

31:23.500 --> 31:29.260
And even though there are those hidden behind platinum titles who like to pretend that we

31:29.260 --> 31:35.580
don't exist, who like to pretend that the Marshall Islands, Tuvalu, Kiribati, Maldives,

31:35.580 --> 31:41.820
Typhoon Haiyan in the Philippines, floods of Algeria, Colombia, Pakistan, and all the hurricanes,

31:41.820 --> 31:51.740
earthquakes, and tidal waves didn't exist, still, there are those who see us, hands reaching

31:51.740 --> 32:00.140
out, fists raising up, banners unfurling, megaphones booming, and we are canoes blocking

32:00.140 --> 32:01.140
coal ships.

32:01.140 --> 32:03.980
We are the radiance of solar villages.

32:03.980 --> 32:07.860
We are the fresh, clean soil of the farmer's past.

32:07.860 --> 32:11.040
We are teenagers, blooming petitions.

32:11.040 --> 32:17.260
We are families, biking, recycling, reusing, engineers, building, dreaming, designing,

32:17.260 --> 32:23.060
artists, painting, dancing, writing, and we are spreading the word.

32:23.060 --> 32:28.820
And there are thousands out on the streets, marching hand in hand, chanting for change

32:28.820 --> 32:29.820
now.

32:29.820 --> 32:33.500
And they're marching for you, baby.

32:33.500 --> 32:40.060
They're marching for us because we deserve to do more than just survive.

32:40.060 --> 32:43.020
We deserve to thrive.

32:43.020 --> 32:49.980
Dear Mata Felipe, you are eyes heavy with drowsy weight, so just close those eyes and

32:49.980 --> 32:52.140
sleep in peace.

32:52.140 --> 32:57.420
Because we won't let you down, you'll see.

32:57.420 --> 33:00.940
Standing ovations aren't common at the United Nations.

33:00.940 --> 33:05.860
Kathy's lasted a full minute.

33:05.860 --> 33:11.220
Why do you think poetry is an effective means of activism?

33:11.220 --> 33:16.340
What is it about poetry that you think makes people listen?

33:16.340 --> 33:20.580
Well I think poetry forces people to slow down and connect to the emotion of the issue,

33:20.580 --> 33:21.580
right?

33:21.580 --> 33:29.440
Rather than just facts and data and fear and, you know, written statements, right?

33:29.440 --> 33:30.840
Poetry is personal.

33:30.840 --> 33:35.160
Poetry connects you to the issue and connects you to why you should care about the issue.

33:35.160 --> 33:38.100
And then, it was time to go to Paris.

33:38.100 --> 33:43.340
The Paris conference lasted 14 days, and for the first 11, nearly all discussion centered

33:43.340 --> 33:45.320
around two degrees.

33:45.320 --> 33:50.180
But in the final three days of negotiation, Tony de Broom began to execute his plan when

33:50.180 --> 33:56.380
he unveiled the High Ambition Coalition—a previously secret alliance of over 90 countries

33:56.380 --> 33:59.760
that Tony had spent the last year coalescing.

33:59.760 --> 34:04.880
The High Ambition Coalition ranged from the small atoll of Kiribati to the powerful nations

34:04.880 --> 34:10.080
of the European Union and together, they turned the entire conference on its head,

34:10.080 --> 34:13.640
demanding the agreement include 1.5.

34:13.640 --> 34:18.220
It was such a jarring and extraordinary show of power orchestrated by such a small nation

34:18.220 --> 34:21.040
that many said it couldn't be real.

34:21.040 --> 34:25.000
Chinese negotiators called it meaningless, representatives from Bangladesh called it

34:25.000 --> 34:31.440
a stunt, and in truth, it was not completely clear just how formal this coalition was—unpressed,

34:31.440 --> 34:33.960
Tony couldn't even say how many members it had.

34:34.040 --> 34:37.680
But it didn't matter, because the momentum had already changed.

34:37.680 --> 34:42.880
New countries began to join—Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Iceland, Sweden.

34:42.880 --> 34:47.560
Before long, a majority of the represented nations supported 1.5.

34:47.560 --> 34:54.080
In less than three days, Tony de Broom took 1.5 from pipe dream to reality.

34:54.080 --> 34:59.600
In the end, 184 countries resolved that they would, quote, hold the increase in the global

34:59.600 --> 35:04.440
temperature to well below 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels and pursue efforts

35:04.440 --> 35:09.680
to limit the temperature increase to 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels.

35:09.680 --> 35:12.480
They got 1.5 in there, right?

35:12.480 --> 35:20.120
1.5, huge for us, the global temperature, you know, to maintain our survival.

35:20.120 --> 35:24.800
Before we went to that conference, I was told by many people that 1.5 wouldn't make it

35:24.800 --> 35:25.800
in there.

35:25.800 --> 35:27.520
It was too hard.

35:27.520 --> 35:30.640
Even though for our survival, we need that temperature to be recognized.

35:30.640 --> 35:34.280
Yeah, Tony was the one that orchestrated that.

35:34.280 --> 35:40.760
And so beyond that, you know, we've also continued that momentum from Tony's legacy

35:40.760 --> 35:41.760
once he passed on.

35:41.760 --> 35:50.560
Yes, we were kind of a champion for climate change in the Paris meeting, you know, by

35:50.560 --> 35:59.080
working with a group of people, which was called the Eye Ambition Group.

35:59.080 --> 36:06.080
And it was kind of amazing for us to be able to gather a number of people who supported

36:06.080 --> 36:12.000
us during the meetings and resulted in the Paris Accord.

36:12.000 --> 36:18.480
It was an enormous, unexpected, deserved victory, but it didn't last.

36:18.480 --> 36:22.520
The Paris Agreement was, without a doubt, the most important collective step the world

36:22.520 --> 36:24.920
had made towards solving climate change.

36:24.920 --> 36:29.680
It was also, in many ways, a complete and utter failure.

36:29.680 --> 36:33.800
Many of the pledges made by countries were unspecific, unambitious, and perhaps most

36:33.800 --> 36:36.080
importantly, unenforceable.

36:36.080 --> 36:41.760
In Paris, the world promised to pursue efforts to limit temperatures to 1.5.

36:41.760 --> 36:45.000
Already in 2015, it was a weak promise.

36:45.000 --> 36:48.040
The five years since have proved it meaningless.

36:48.080 --> 36:52.440
Paris was supposed to serve as a starting place, with more ambitious pledges to be made

36:52.440 --> 36:53.440
in the future.

36:53.440 --> 36:59.100
Now, it is the future, and the more ambitious pledges are nowhere to be found.

36:59.100 --> 37:04.480
And even the inadequate commitments of Paris have often been completely ignored.

37:04.480 --> 37:07.920
In stories, the underdog is supposed to win.

37:07.920 --> 37:13.000
When they give it their all, when they combine dreams and drive, when they form a high ambition

37:13.000 --> 37:17.920
coalition, when they read Dear Mattaffé le Penem, when they chant 1.5 to stay alive,

37:17.920 --> 37:20.320
it's supposed to work.

37:20.320 --> 37:27.600
Today, projections show that under the best case scenario, we'll reach 1.5 in 2052.

37:27.600 --> 37:29.840
Worst case, 2030.

37:29.840 --> 37:36.320
Either way, in a few short decades, three millennia of marshally civilization will come

37:36.320 --> 37:39.600
to an end.

37:39.600 --> 37:44.480
Currently today, flooding and inundation are common in the Marshall Islands, but things

37:44.480 --> 37:49.160
get especially bad during what the marshallese call King Tides.

37:49.160 --> 37:56.280
The islands are becoming more and more inundated with waters during spring tide and also during

37:56.280 --> 37:57.320
king's tide.

37:57.320 --> 38:03.880
When the high tide, king tide comes, it destroys the whole village, the water comes to the

38:03.880 --> 38:04.880
road.

38:04.880 --> 38:07.760
My cousin lost her house in a really bad king tide flooding.

38:07.760 --> 38:10.960
Since 2011, we've seen more and more king tides.

38:10.960 --> 38:17.280
A combination of lunar cycles, wind patterns, and of course, rising seas coalesce into waves

38:17.280 --> 38:20.120
that flood streets, yards, and homes.

38:20.120 --> 38:25.600
For the marshallese, the destruction and disorder king tides bring have become an increasingly

38:25.600 --> 38:27.680
normal part of everyday life.

38:27.680 --> 38:33.680
We're flat as a pancake here and if you go out today, 545's the high tide, you know

38:33.680 --> 38:34.680
why I know that?

38:35.200 --> 38:38.200
Because yesterday I was driving home a little after five and the water was splashing, I

38:38.200 --> 38:44.080
drive Volkswagens, the water splashing on a, salt water splashing on a Volkswagon is

38:44.080 --> 38:47.360
not a good feeling because they melt with the rust.

38:47.360 --> 38:51.080
And so I knew today, I always know when the high tide is because I worry about that kind

38:51.080 --> 38:52.080
of stuff.

38:52.080 --> 38:54.700
But other people worry about it too because it's hitting their houses.

38:54.700 --> 38:57.840
You never used to know when high tides were out unless you were someone who was out at

38:57.840 --> 39:02.160
the sea all the time and you were a diver or whatever and you counted on that stuff.

39:02.160 --> 39:05.000
Now everybody kind of knows when the big high tide is going to be and they know what

39:05.000 --> 39:06.000
they have to do.

39:06.000 --> 39:08.440
We never used to think like that here, ever.

39:08.440 --> 39:13.000
Flooding and inundation don't just destroy what's been created on the atoll.

39:13.000 --> 39:16.720
It also destroys the atoll's ability to create.

39:16.720 --> 39:26.040
The water is coming up on the ground too and also contaminating our well waters and affecting

39:26.040 --> 39:28.600
our food crops.

39:28.600 --> 39:33.520
And of course the breadfruit trees that we used to depend on to build our canoes and

39:33.520 --> 39:41.360
provide food are dying because the water lengths on these islands are getting smaller and smaller

39:41.360 --> 39:44.360
and they cannot survive the salt water.

39:44.360 --> 39:49.920
But the most pressing effect of climate change is also perhaps the most unexpected.

39:49.920 --> 39:54.400
So currently the most urgent effects are illnesses.

39:54.400 --> 39:57.200
So climate-related illnesses like dengue.

39:57.200 --> 40:01.200
Mosquito-borne illnesses are supposed to increase with climate effects.

40:01.200 --> 40:05.500
So we have three different health issues we're dealing with right now on the Marshall Islands.

40:05.500 --> 40:09.960
The first of course is dengue fever that's been going on for about eight months now.

40:09.960 --> 40:12.840
We've been in a state of health emergency.

40:12.840 --> 40:23.680
The second one is, we've had over 25 cases, 2500 cases of dengue since last July.

40:23.680 --> 40:27.320
And so that's been our major battle we're fighting right here now.

40:27.320 --> 40:31.380
And then secondly, we've had measles, which we haven't had a case yet, but we've put

40:31.380 --> 40:33.640
in all kinds of preventative measures.

40:33.640 --> 40:37.000
And of course coronavirus in the same category, we're just trying to prevent it.

40:37.000 --> 40:41.200
We haven't had any yet, but we're being very strict with how people come in.

40:41.200 --> 40:47.120
Actually the way I feel is that most of what we're seeing right now is climate change,

40:47.120 --> 40:49.120
the result of climate change.

40:49.120 --> 40:53.480
With rising temperatures come more mosquitoes, increasing the risk of transmission for insect

40:53.480 --> 40:56.360
borne diseases like Zika and dengue.

40:56.360 --> 41:01.100
More severe water cycles—flooding, high rainfalls, drought—all propagate contaminated

41:01.100 --> 41:06.740
water supplies, increasing the spread of cholera, E. coli, and other diarrheal diseases.

41:06.740 --> 41:12.760
In fact, for almost every infectious disease out there—malaria, Ebola, Lyme, West Nile,

41:12.760 --> 41:17.000
typhoid—research predicts that climate change will make it worse.

41:17.000 --> 41:22.360
According to the World Health Organization, over the next 20 years, over 2 million people

41:22.480 --> 41:27.040
will die as a result of climate change related disease.

41:27.040 --> 41:28.480
This is like not normal.

41:28.480 --> 41:31.280
This is not nothing that we've ever experienced before.

41:31.280 --> 41:33.560
We're in the eighth month of a state of health emergency.

41:33.560 --> 41:37.300
The Marshall Islands has never been in a state of health emergency this long ever.

41:37.300 --> 41:39.840
We've never seen a bigger disease outbreak.

41:39.840 --> 41:43.820
We've never seen all these deaths throughout the Pacific in recent times from things like

41:43.820 --> 41:45.980
measles that we thought were gone.

41:45.980 --> 41:51.360
So I think the really important thing that people have to understand is this is not the

41:51.360 --> 41:56.160
way things used to be, but this is the way it's becoming now normal.

41:56.160 --> 42:00.520
And that to me is a result of the massive climate change and the massive warming that's

42:00.520 --> 42:01.560
been going on.

42:01.560 --> 42:07.320
You have to start talking about health and connecting it to climate change because there's

42:07.320 --> 42:09.240
no other explanation for this.

42:09.240 --> 42:10.360
There really isn't.

42:10.360 --> 42:15.920
When you combine it all—inundation, land loss, crop death, coral bleaching, drought,

42:15.920 --> 42:20.220
disease—a single, clear picture forms.

42:20.220 --> 42:25.880
These are all becoming a potent package which are linked to the adverse effects of climate

42:25.880 --> 42:26.880
change.

42:26.880 --> 42:34.140
And that potency is a bit too much or beyond the capability of small atoll nations to respond

42:34.140 --> 42:35.140
to.

42:35.140 --> 42:43.360
And so all of these packaged, potent adverse effects are proving to be catastrophic.

42:43.360 --> 42:49.460
The future that the Marshall Islands fought so hard to prevent is already coming to pass.

42:49.460 --> 42:59.680
The islands are dying, and soon, they'll be truly, permanently, and irreversibly uninhabitable.

42:59.680 --> 43:05.980
Two options have emerged—stay and fight a losing battle, or leave and start a new

43:05.980 --> 43:06.980
life.

43:06.980 --> 43:09.500
In truth, though, those options are the same.

43:09.500 --> 43:12.980
The only variable is time.

43:12.980 --> 43:18.740
Thousands of miles away, far from the fury of the ocean, a new atoll is emerging.

43:18.740 --> 43:24.840
One encircled not by sea, but by streets—a land made not of coral, but of concrete.

43:24.840 --> 43:29.520
One where abundance is measured not by the size of your family, but rather the sum of

43:29.520 --> 43:30.520
your money.

43:30.520 --> 43:34.160
One dotted not by palm trees, but by poultry plants.

43:34.160 --> 43:39.200
Hope is not plentiful for the Marshallese, but there's a spark of it here, nestled

43:39.200 --> 43:42.540
in the northwestern corner of Arkansas.

43:42.540 --> 43:48.160
Springdale is, I would describe it as more of a blue-collar, working-class community

43:48.160 --> 43:54.240
in the midst of a thriving area of northwest Arkansas, one of the top five fastest growing

43:54.240 --> 43:55.360
areas in the country.

43:55.360 --> 43:56.640
We are a very diverse city.

43:56.640 --> 43:59.600
We've got 44 languages spoken in our school district.

43:59.600 --> 44:08.200
Our two largest minorities would be Latino, which is probably somewhere around 35 to 40

44:08.200 --> 44:09.200
percent.

44:09.200 --> 44:10.200
Could be a little higher.

44:10.200 --> 44:16.720
We'll find out in the 2020 census, and a large Marshallese population.

44:16.720 --> 44:22.400
We've been told the largest Marshallese population outside of the Marshall Islands.

44:22.400 --> 44:27.800
Exact figures vary—2010 census numbers peg it in the low thousands, but that figure is

44:27.800 --> 44:29.920
almost certainly inaccurate.

44:29.920 --> 44:35.760
In reality, currently, it is believed that as many as 15,000 Marshallese live in the

44:35.760 --> 44:42.920
Springdale area—one fifth of all Marshallese people tucked away in this small Ozark city.

44:42.920 --> 44:48.560
Of course, in a country of countless options, the question to some might be, why Springdale,

44:48.560 --> 44:49.560
Arkansas?

44:49.560 --> 44:53.800
The story, as it's told, begins in 1979.

44:53.800 --> 44:59.600
A Marshallese man named John Moody was awarded a scholarship to the University of Oklahoma—a

44:59.600 --> 45:03.240
dream coming from a nation yet to have a single college.

45:03.240 --> 45:07.020
Moody soon decided, though, that he wasn't cut out for the academic life.

45:07.020 --> 45:11.680
He shifted paths, taking a job at a poultry plant in Muskogee, Oklahoma, earning $3.25

45:12.040 --> 45:16.640
an hour—multiples more than any comparable job in the Marshalls.

45:16.640 --> 45:21.200
Soon, though, the business took him to the largest poultry producer in the world, Tyson

45:21.200 --> 45:24.840
Foods, headquartered in Springdale, Arkansas.

45:24.840 --> 45:29.480
Pay was decent, openings were plentiful, and English was optional, so word soon traveled

45:29.480 --> 45:35.260
from Moody to his family in the Marshalls that Springdale was the land of opportunity.

45:35.260 --> 45:39.920
So they came, and spread the word to others, and they came, and spread the word, and more

45:39.920 --> 45:45.200
came, and spread the word, and soon enough, as the social networks of a small nation saturated

45:45.200 --> 45:50.240
with the promise of a better life, Springdale established itself as the destination for

45:50.240 --> 45:53.000
Marshallese immigration to the US.

45:53.000 --> 45:58.880
Now, decades on, what started as one man in a chicken plant has turned into the largest

45:58.880 --> 46:02.960
population of Marshallese outside of the islands themselves.

46:02.960 --> 46:07.680
The city has 30-odd Marshallese churches, has become a key campaign stop for Marshallese

46:07.680 --> 46:12.200
politicians, and it's even home to a tiny consulate representing the Marshallese government

46:12.200 --> 46:13.620
itself.

46:13.620 --> 46:17.640
The mission is one of just eight the Marshalls have abroad.

46:17.640 --> 46:21.800
Sharing a modest two-story building with a barber, accountant, and lawyer, it is the

46:21.800 --> 46:27.080
only consulate of any nation for hundreds of miles and one of only two in the state

46:27.080 --> 46:28.080
of Arkansas.

46:28.080 --> 46:34.160
It's staffed just by an assistant, the consul's wife, and the consul general himself.

46:34.160 --> 46:35.160
My name is Eldon Alik.

46:35.160 --> 46:39.520
I'm the consul general for the Republic of the Marshall Islands here in Springdale,

46:39.520 --> 46:40.520
Arkansas.

46:40.520 --> 46:45.680
The job of the consul is to, number one, provide consul services to the Marshallese citizens

46:45.680 --> 46:52.400
here, and assist the Marshallese population here with whatever they need.

46:52.400 --> 46:57.240
Try to be the eyes and ears of the government of the Marshall Islands here.

46:57.240 --> 47:01.960
Call it luck or call it intuition, but Moody and the thousands that followed were right

47:01.960 --> 47:04.640
to choose Springdale as their new homes.

47:04.640 --> 47:09.120
The city has been experiencing a decades-long economic boom.

47:09.120 --> 47:15.680
We have an entrepreneurial spirit here in northwest Arkansas, not only Springdale, but

47:15.680 --> 47:24.560
we've seen many Fortune 100 companies, Walmart, of course, about 30 miles north.

47:24.560 --> 47:31.560
We've got Tyson right here in Springdale, which is the first or second largest protein

47:31.560 --> 47:33.120
producer in the world.

47:33.120 --> 47:39.280
We have, because of our growth, certainly the building industry, the building trades.

47:39.280 --> 47:45.060
There's a lot going on here that, you know, our unemployment right now is just barely

47:45.060 --> 47:47.520
over 2% in Springdale.

47:47.520 --> 47:52.240
Pretty much anyone who wants one, no matter their age, origin, or education level, can

47:52.240 --> 47:54.280
get a job in Springdale.

47:54.280 --> 47:58.840
Well, Marshallese, we generally like to follow one another.

47:58.840 --> 48:01.120
We come here to be near our families.

48:01.120 --> 48:05.560
The poultry industry doesn't really take a lot of skills and education.

48:05.560 --> 48:06.840
People just come here and they can work.

48:06.840 --> 48:09.240
They're going to arrive today and work tomorrow.

48:09.240 --> 48:13.640
Under the Compact of Free Association, any Marshallese citizen can live and work in the

48:13.640 --> 48:20.000
US—a right others, at best, wait years or decades to attain.

48:20.000 --> 48:21.920
But there are still barriers.

48:21.920 --> 48:25.600
Perhaps the most significant is the first—getting there.

48:25.600 --> 48:32.240
A one-way plane ticket from Majuro to Springdale costs about $1,500—a substantial sum for

48:32.240 --> 48:35.680
anyone but a fortune in the Marshall Islands.

48:35.680 --> 48:39.680
There, $1,500 is half a year's wage.

48:39.680 --> 48:43.720
In Springdale, though, $1,500 is less than a month's.

48:43.720 --> 48:47.320
Some families, they come here little by little.

48:47.320 --> 48:52.120
Sometimes they just send the father first, and then the mother, and then the kids, and

48:52.120 --> 48:54.120
then the parents, the grandparents.

48:54.480 --> 48:56.480
So they just do little by little.

48:56.480 --> 49:02.640
Each earns enough to pay for the next, over time bringing the entire family to Springdale.

49:02.640 --> 49:09.960
So we did a study, and the majority of the people that actually took the study replied

49:09.960 --> 49:16.040
that family responsibility was the first reason why they moved.

49:16.040 --> 49:22.520
You know, and usually their departure from the islands are very, very unplanned.

49:22.520 --> 49:27.600
That's because, you know, a sister would call in and say, hey, I have some money.

49:27.600 --> 49:29.600
I have some money to buy you a ticket.

49:29.600 --> 49:30.600
Get ready.

49:30.600 --> 49:35.400
You're going to be on the plane in the next two weeks, so you can come and help me with

49:35.400 --> 49:38.880
my mom or, you know, with someone so I can find a job.

49:38.880 --> 49:44.640
And while you take care of the family member, you know, I have a way to bring income into

49:44.640 --> 49:45.640
the house.

49:45.640 --> 49:49.960
Despite their political, economic, and social connections, though, the Marshall Islands

49:49.960 --> 49:54.680
and the United States are not the same, and the adjustment is not always easy.

49:54.680 --> 50:02.280
There are just so many cultural barriers that we see on a daily basis.

50:02.280 --> 50:09.040
One is, Marshallese culture is a very sharing culture, you know, one property is owned by

50:09.040 --> 50:10.040
everyone.

50:10.040 --> 50:16.640
It's just not individual ownership of their property, but, you know, everyone in that

50:16.640 --> 50:18.840
clan owns it.

50:18.840 --> 50:26.560
And when you look in terms of households, it is perfectly okay for multiple family members

50:26.560 --> 50:33.280
to live under one roof, whereas, you know, here, you know, you have those, the enforced

50:33.280 --> 50:35.440
codes where it's prohibited.

50:35.440 --> 50:41.600
You know, I don't know what the codes of ordinances in the Marshall Islands look like, but I can

50:41.600 --> 50:45.580
be pretty confident they're quite a bit different than ours here in Springdale, Arkansas.

50:45.580 --> 50:53.880
We came from a world that money really didn't mean anything for us, but here it is.

50:53.880 --> 50:58.700
People in the United States, they were economically driven, whereas we're not.

50:58.700 --> 51:00.680
We never had to pay rent.

51:00.680 --> 51:08.040
We never have to worry about having a lot of money so we can buy food because, you know,

51:08.040 --> 51:13.460
you have our biggest refrigerator was the ocean, and it was right there, is readily

51:13.460 --> 51:14.460
available.

51:14.460 --> 51:16.620
So we really didn't have to worry about saving.

51:16.620 --> 51:20.500
You're comparing a very small world to a big world.

51:20.500 --> 51:26.300
Nonetheless, in making the difficult transition to America, having a familiar community makes

51:26.300 --> 51:27.300
it easier.

51:27.300 --> 51:30.340
You're surrounded by over 35 churches.

51:30.340 --> 51:32.080
That's amazing.

51:32.080 --> 51:37.180
And you have a consul general's office here, you have our office as well, you have other

51:37.180 --> 51:40.060
non-profit offices as well.

51:40.060 --> 51:45.900
And the people are very supportive in this area, very supportive of the Marshallese community.

51:45.900 --> 51:53.460
It kind of like gives you that value in preserving your culture and I think that's why I refer

51:53.460 --> 52:00.380
Springdale to as Springdale 8 Holes because this is really the culture, this is the hub

52:00.380 --> 52:03.260
of the culture.

52:03.260 --> 52:08.100
Popular media might predict that the story of a group of people from a far-off land descending

52:08.100 --> 52:13.780
on and settling a small southern city would end in tension and animosity.

52:13.780 --> 52:16.620
That is not the story of Springdale.

52:16.620 --> 52:20.580
You know, I wish I knew what the secret sauce was for that because I think we could use

52:20.580 --> 52:27.820
that in a lot of places throughout our country, this openness and willingness to accept change.

52:27.820 --> 52:29.860
And I don't want to candy-coat it.

52:29.860 --> 52:34.620
There are other people who grew up here just like me that continue to talk about the good

52:34.620 --> 52:39.180
old days and the days when we grew up and things were different.

52:39.180 --> 52:43.520
But you know, I'm just reminded that we're somebody's good old days right now.

52:43.520 --> 52:47.920
The people growing up here right now will look back on this time as the good old days

52:47.920 --> 52:50.780
no matter what it looks like.

52:50.780 --> 52:58.460
And so I think a willingness on the part of the people of Springdale to treat people as

52:58.460 --> 53:02.980
human beings, surely there's nothing special about Springdale.

53:02.980 --> 53:06.500
Probably everyone, every place can do that.

53:06.500 --> 53:10.620
Springdale, as it exists for the Marshallese, is fortuitous.

53:10.620 --> 53:15.100
Fortuitous because John Moody and the early migrants who followed had no idea of their

53:15.100 --> 53:16.740
island's bleak fate.

53:16.740 --> 53:22.180
They migrated for a brighter economic future, but now, with the direct threat of a rising

53:22.180 --> 53:26.620
ocean, Marshallese are starting to migrate to escape the water.

53:26.620 --> 53:31.380
I think some people have a, well, because obviously they have a rice, and that wasn't

53:31.380 --> 53:34.540
the case maybe five, ten years ago.

53:34.540 --> 53:38.860
People were coming here for better opportunities, but I've talked to some people and they've

53:38.860 --> 53:41.500
come here for sea level rise.

53:41.500 --> 53:48.740
Plan A is staying and live there and fight, fight the climate change, but if Plan A doesn't

53:48.740 --> 53:52.740
work, you know, this is where I feel the calling.

53:52.740 --> 53:54.660
This is where I need to be at.

53:54.660 --> 54:02.060
And if really, if that happens, that's, wow, that's taking away our identity, you know,

54:02.060 --> 54:05.780
that's basically stripping us down to the bare skin.

54:05.780 --> 54:07.460
And I'm not sure how I'm going to take that.

54:07.460 --> 54:10.620
That will be very hard for me to process.

54:10.620 --> 54:18.580
However, I feel that I can't just cry and feel sad because that happened.

54:18.580 --> 54:19.820
I have to do something.

54:19.820 --> 54:22.180
I have to make, reestablish.

54:22.180 --> 54:29.180
I feel like reestablishing somewhere else that is safe, that provides you the freedom,

54:29.180 --> 54:35.580
the freedom to make a choice, is probably my next thing that I will focus on.

54:35.580 --> 54:38.840
Plan A is still very much in motion for many.

54:38.840 --> 54:43.060
Most Marshallese are still at their home, fighting to hold on to their lives as long

54:43.060 --> 54:48.000
as the waters will allow them—those who can buy a few additional years by building

54:48.000 --> 54:50.140
a wall between them and the ocean.

54:50.740 --> 54:54.900
Well, we call this, we call this a concrete wall.

54:54.900 --> 55:04.940
So we, first we build the concrete base about five to six feet wide and two feet from the,

55:04.940 --> 55:06.300
from the ground.

55:06.300 --> 55:12.380
When the high tide come, not even normal like other, other dive wounds.

55:12.380 --> 55:18.700
And after I build wall there, people there, they're living happy there.

55:18.700 --> 55:27.860
I see, I see that the seawall has been protecting them, but there's other people, same village.

55:27.860 --> 55:34.980
The other people live on the other side, about two, two houses from the outside of the seawall.

55:34.980 --> 55:37.900
Now they're affecting because there's no wall there.

55:37.900 --> 55:43.740
If wall wasn't here, there's no wall here.

55:43.780 --> 55:51.580
I know that the water, the trash, the rocks, they were coming right here.

55:51.580 --> 55:55.220
They're going, want to, how many houses there?

55:55.220 --> 55:56.220
Yeah.

55:56.220 --> 55:59.540
And it's been happening over, it's been happening over and over.

55:59.540 --> 56:03.300
Every kick tide's coming, they're always like that.

56:03.300 --> 56:06.300
They're bringing rocks and trash.

56:06.300 --> 56:11.540
Do you think seawalls could protect Majuro for 200 years, 300 years?

56:11.540 --> 56:12.540
Oh no.

56:14.140 --> 56:15.140
Don't trust me.

56:15.140 --> 56:20.860
Believe me, even though we're making wall, it's not going to protect because we're damaging

56:20.860 --> 56:21.860
the reef.

56:21.860 --> 56:29.140
And if, as long as you trill the reef and building concrete wall, you're messing with

56:29.140 --> 56:30.820
the mother nature, you know?

56:30.820 --> 56:36.620
At this point, the goal is not to prevent the destruction of the marshals, just to delay

56:36.620 --> 56:37.820
it.

56:37.900 --> 56:44.900
If the time limit is in five years, then, you know, we move five years.

56:44.900 --> 56:51.580
But between now and five years, we want to make sure that we spend every minute thinking

56:51.580 --> 56:55.860
about how to survive on these islands, just like our ancestor did.

56:55.860 --> 56:59.540
Land is supposed to be the embodiment of permanence.

56:59.540 --> 57:05.580
A nation is nothing without its land, but now the Marshall Islands is temporary.

57:05.580 --> 57:10.500
In the back of everyone's mind is the realization that the soil they stand on will eventually

57:10.500 --> 57:11.500
be submerged.

57:11.500 --> 57:15.860
You know, with our infrastructure projects, you know, what are we doing?

57:15.860 --> 57:20.300
Why are we doing this, you know, 20, 30, 40 years?

57:20.300 --> 57:21.740
Could be swamped under water.

57:21.740 --> 57:27.820
I don't know, it's like, you know, part of the work you do is try to prepare for the,

57:27.820 --> 57:32.980
you know, the future of submerging.

57:32.980 --> 57:37.020
And part of it is you just carry on with your day-to-day activities, which means, you know,

57:37.020 --> 57:40.860
look, these projects are still funded, they're on the books, they're approved, we still got

57:40.860 --> 57:42.860
to do them.

57:42.860 --> 57:45.380
Now, when is that going to change?

57:45.380 --> 57:47.500
I don't know.

57:47.500 --> 57:48.500
I don't know.

57:48.500 --> 57:53.700
It's going to take some kind of visible tipping point somewhere then, I think, for that to

57:53.700 --> 57:54.700
happen.

57:54.700 --> 58:00.860
I mean, really, I mean, significant, not just a high king tide, you know, we've had those.

58:00.860 --> 58:01.860
Or another El Nino.

58:01.860 --> 58:02.860
Again, we've had those.

58:02.860 --> 58:10.300
I think it's going to take something else maybe, unfortunately, maybe worse for us to,

58:10.300 --> 58:19.020
I don't know, then get to the realization, well, this is it, you know, we've got to stop

58:19.020 --> 58:27.020
and just have a new web activity and divert the energies into some other kind of future.

58:27.020 --> 58:32.980
Well, when you think, when people say to me that they think the Marshall Islands has

58:32.980 --> 58:38.860
a time limit, I think they have to start thinking about the bigger picture here.

58:38.860 --> 58:41.180
We're the canary in the coal mine.

58:41.180 --> 58:44.820
If we have a limited time here, then so does everywhere else.

58:44.820 --> 58:48.200
I mean, this is the way, this is the way it's evolving.

58:48.200 --> 58:51.020
And so many times we've been the canary out there.

58:51.020 --> 58:55.020
We're the canary in the coal mine for nuclear testing.

58:55.020 --> 58:57.740
Now we're the canary in the coal mine for climate change.

58:57.740 --> 59:06.340
The reason why this, our ocean is mad and is crawling closer to our living room is because

59:06.340 --> 59:11.980
the same people that brought in the nuclear testing to the country are the same people

59:11.980 --> 59:13.580
that are doing this.

59:13.580 --> 59:16.080
They're trying to find resource.

59:16.080 --> 59:21.500
First they tried to find the power to control the world and using our islands to test the

59:21.500 --> 59:23.260
nuclear weapon.

59:23.260 --> 59:29.060
Then they went back and tried to find the best way to gain resources in a short period

59:29.060 --> 59:37.060
of time by using things that would destroy the world and our mother nature is not happy

59:37.060 --> 59:41.280
so she's coming back to us, but in a very roaring way.

59:41.280 --> 59:46.260
We as Marshallese people enter the conversation of climate change as survivors of the nuclear

59:46.260 --> 59:50.420
legacy, as in we already understand what it means to have lost homes, to have lost that

59:50.420 --> 59:55.660
connection to land, to have something ripped away from us for global, because of global

59:55.660 --> 01:00:00.100
needs and you know, because of a global concern or whatever, right?

01:00:00.100 --> 01:00:04.360
The US decided to test nuclear weapons in the Marshall Islands because we were seen

01:00:04.360 --> 01:00:09.220
as disposable and now with climate change happening, more or less and less people care

01:00:09.220 --> 01:00:10.220
about it.

01:00:10.220 --> 01:00:13.900
You know, there are very few people who care about it and the ones in power don't care

01:00:13.900 --> 01:00:17.420
about it because again, we're seen as disposable.

01:00:17.420 --> 01:00:21.060
That's the intersection between climate change and the nuclear legacy.

01:00:21.060 --> 01:00:24.540
We've experienced it already and that's why we're fighting even harder against climate

01:00:24.540 --> 01:00:25.540
change.

01:00:25.540 --> 01:00:27.060
We don't want to lose the rest of our islands.

01:00:27.060 --> 01:00:30.360
We've already experienced that loss and that trauma.

01:00:30.360 --> 01:00:33.700
We are going to be the first climate change refugees.

01:00:33.700 --> 01:00:36.540
I truly believe that.

01:00:36.540 --> 01:00:43.960
That's happening and people are in denial of it because they're responsible for it.

01:00:43.960 --> 01:00:46.180
This is my country.

01:00:46.180 --> 01:00:47.180
This is where I live.

01:00:47.180 --> 01:00:48.820
This is where my kids go to school.

01:00:48.820 --> 01:00:54.540
This is where I want them to all be and this is the society I want them to contribute to.

01:00:54.540 --> 01:01:00.780
I think it's, you know, it's a tough concept to think about.

01:01:00.780 --> 01:01:04.280
It's like thinking, if you have children, thinking about them being in a car accident

01:01:04.280 --> 01:01:07.000
or getting a terminal illness.

01:01:07.000 --> 01:01:09.420
You don't want to think about it because it's so painful.

01:01:09.420 --> 01:01:25.600
You know, we love our culture, we love our custom and we love the way of life that we

01:01:25.600 --> 01:01:26.600
have here.

01:01:26.600 --> 01:01:32.860
If we were to leave, go somewhere else, we would probably lose our custom, we would probably

01:01:32.860 --> 01:01:37.580
lose our ability to look after ourselves as a people.

01:01:37.580 --> 01:01:41.400
Right now, it's still a debate in many of these First World nations.

01:01:41.400 --> 01:01:42.400
What do we do?

01:01:42.400 --> 01:01:43.400
Can we do it?

01:01:43.400 --> 01:01:44.780
What are the changes we can make?

01:01:44.780 --> 01:01:45.780
Do we believe in it?

01:01:45.780 --> 01:01:46.780
Is it even real?

01:01:46.780 --> 01:01:48.140
Is it worth the funding?

01:01:48.140 --> 01:01:49.140
Can we change?

01:01:49.140 --> 01:01:50.140
That's not where we're at.

01:01:50.140 --> 01:01:53.040
Where we're at is very much, it's going to happen.

01:01:53.040 --> 01:01:55.120
We have to figure out how to plan for it.

01:01:55.120 --> 01:02:01.980
We probably will be looking back at our country from a higher ground.

01:02:01.980 --> 01:02:09.140
This is going to be, wow, this is going to be something that I just can't describe in

01:02:09.140 --> 01:02:18.060
terms of culturally, as a people, civilization, what this is going to mean for the kids and

01:02:18.060 --> 01:02:22.500
grandkids.

01:02:22.500 --> 01:02:27.740
To be honest, I'm worried about my generation and the next generation and the future on

01:02:27.740 --> 01:02:35.940
because when we migrate, the main thing I'm scared of is our culture.

01:02:35.940 --> 01:02:38.980
If everyone leaves here, where will our culture go?

01:02:38.980 --> 01:02:46.140
Our culture will slowly fade away and no one knows about our culture, our people, and especially

01:02:46.140 --> 01:02:47.140
Marshall Islands.

01:02:47.140 --> 01:02:56.260
Yeah, it hits me every time, but I really try to ignore it, but I can't because it's

01:02:56.260 --> 01:02:57.260
always trending.

01:02:57.260 --> 01:03:03.420
It's always getting talked about and we really can't put it aside because we're really affected

01:03:03.420 --> 01:03:10.340
now and if we can't do anything now, the future will be affected if we don't do anything now.

01:03:10.340 --> 01:03:13.980
Personally, me, I really don't want to go to other countries.

01:03:13.980 --> 01:03:21.300
I really want to stay here and live the best life in the islands and really share the full

01:03:21.300 --> 01:03:25.680
of joy right here in the Marshall Islands.

01:03:25.680 --> 01:03:31.460
This island really means a lot and just imagine if different countries, if we told them that

01:03:31.460 --> 01:03:37.180
their country doesn't matter and they can just move here and they would feel the same

01:03:37.180 --> 01:03:42.520
way that it feels special for us to have this place because it's unique and our culture

01:03:42.520 --> 01:03:53.100
really lies here.

01:03:53.100 --> 01:04:01.740
People can move, a nation cannot, and though they'll try, any transposition loses fidelity.

01:04:01.740 --> 01:04:07.400
With each generation, the pictures fuzzy, the memories fade.

01:04:07.400 --> 01:04:12.980
The Marshall Islands has endured for millennia, but it was never immortal.

01:04:12.980 --> 01:04:17.300
Nations have ended before, nations will end again.

01:04:17.300 --> 01:04:22.800
Of all the ends the Marshall Islands could meet, though, this one stings most.

01:04:22.800 --> 01:04:30.480
To be killed by the ocean, its creator, turned against it by people who don't even know its name.

01:04:52.800 --> 01:04:59.800
You're not alone, you're not alone, you're not alone, you're not alone, you're not alone, you're not alone.

01:05:22.800 --> 01:05:24.860
you
