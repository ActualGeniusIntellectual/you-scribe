0	4940	The documentary you're about to watch is a Nebula original—that means it was funded
4940	8580	by and released on the streaming platform Nebula first.
8580	12700	We thought, though, that this one in particular would be important to get out to the widest
12700	16260	audience possible given how important the subject matter is.
16260	20860	It is, though, going to be one of the last Nebula originals uploaded to YouTube as we're
20860	21860	phasing that out.
21860	26340	I hope this serves as evidence for you on just how high-quality the content on Nebula
26340	32480	is, and, each week, new originals come out from some of the top educational content creators.
32480	36820	If you want to see more, Nebula is available through a bundle deal with CuriosityStream
36820	41860	for just $15 a year at their current sale pricing, and that's available only by going
41860	45580	to CuriosityStream.com slash Wendover.
45580	47560	Now to the Marshall Islands.
56340	81820	The legend in Marshall's eyes is that the Marshall Islands were created by a cart.
81820	83380	His name was Lawa.
83380	91540	He descended on the atoll of island Lawa, and he created the islands by saying Lawa
91540	97660	and islands, and they were islands, Lawa and people, and they were people, Lawa and fish,
97660	102060	and they were fish, and on and on like that.
102060	108780	Our lands, you know, like our mothers, you know, they provide for everything, and our
108780	109780	oceans, same thing.
109780	115660	We've always thought about the ocean as our friends, but now it's becoming a threat
115660	118860	to us.
118860	124260	You know when you find a globe, and you give it a whirl, and it goes around and around
124260	129180	and around, and then as the going slows, your eyes come to a rest on a dash of color that
129180	133900	has never caught your attention before—a spot that sits on the part of the sphere you
133900	136400	normally spin right past.
136400	141920	An island so isolated that you're not even sure how you'd explain where it is—somewhere
141920	147560	whose story is seen as insignificant, a land that's lost to most of the world, left out
147560	151320	of the history books apart from a passing mention.
151320	156280	That place is here—the Republic of the Marshall Islands.
156280	159980	But unknown, untold, unremembered places aren't unique.
159980	164760	What makes the Marshall Islands story singular is not that it's unrecognized from above,
164760	169240	but because it's under siege, from below, and it's only when you see it from the middle
169240	171880	that you can understand why.
171880	176360	Go on, take a look, you won't have the chance for long.
176360	179840	We can talk more about the end of their world later, but first I've got to tell you about
179840	180840	what we've got here.
180840	185240	It's a small nation, the Marshall Islands, with a bit over 50,000 residents and 70 square
185240	191000	miles of land, split up into 29 atolls—thin rings of land encircling saltwater lagoons.
191000	195860	While significant populations can be found on 13 of those atolls, over half of the Marshallese
195860	199180	people can be found on this one, Majuro.
199180	205040	About 28,000 people live on the capital atoll, and none of those 28,000 live more than a
205040	207160	few minutes' walk from the ocean.
207160	212080	The furthest you can get from the water is about 2,000 feet or 600 meters inland, but
212080	217440	that's an anomaly—in most spots, water flanks you closely on both sides.
217440	222480	In some spots, the atoll gets so thin that you could stand in the lagoon and have a conversation
222480	225280	with someone standing in the ocean.
225280	231320	Life on a remote, sunny coral atoll may sound idyllic, but the population density of Majuro,
231320	236840	greater than that of Bahrain, Bermuda, or Bangladesh, has not been kind to the mother
236840	237840	atoll.
237840	242120	In a part of the world usually thought of as pristine, sparse, and pastoral, Majuro
242120	245400	is instead gritty, overcrowded, and urbanized.
245400	249520	But it's far from an island paradise.
249520	254840	Based on the 2011 census, which was the last census we had, average household size on Majuro
254840	261520	was about seven people, and household income is probably about $16,000 in that neighborhood.
261520	270120	Well, I mean, $16,000 divided by seven, you know, it can be, that can be a challenge,
270120	271120	that can be tough.
271120	272800	Here's the problem.
272800	276800	Some places are poor because they haven't yet seized their opportunity.
276800	280120	Others are poor because they have no opportunity.
280120	283600	Majuro is in that second category.
283600	287840	Characteristics of the economy here in the islands is, you know, you're looking at
287840	290040	fish, coconuts, people.
290040	294920	I mean, outside of that, our natural resources are fairly scarce.
294920	300720	And then combined with our challenges with education and skills attainment makes it even
300720	305200	more challenging with people being our third largest natural resource.
305200	311760	Those are some major inhibitors for, you know, sustaining economic growth, expanding the
311760	313940	economy here in the islands.
313940	317880	Like many small island nations, the Marshall Islands doesn't have too much in the way
317880	322360	of natural resources worth exporting, and even when it does manage to produce something
322360	326840	people might want to buy, the cost of shipping it to those potential buyers will have pumped
326840	330580	up the price so much that it's no longer worth it.
330580	334880	One of the very few things they make decent business of selling abroad is copra, or dried
334880	339100	coconut meat, which is produced mainly on outer atolls and then brought into Majuro
339100	340100	for processing.
340100	344840	It's a work-intensive process mostly conducted by families who form informal assembly lines
344840	349620	getting paid 50 cents a pound, and even that low wage is the result of heavy government
349620	351600	subsidies.
351600	356120	Because creating viable export goods is so difficult, most of the jobs in the Marshall
356120	359060	Islands are either in government or the subsistence economy.
359060	363100	In other words, most people in the Marshall Islands are providing services or making goods
363100	368340	exclusively for the Marshall Islands, which leaves very little opportunity for growth.
368340	374060	But the country does have one tiny little asset that keeps it running—its location.
374060	378300	A location that makes the Marshall Islands attractive to one of the world's biggest
378300	382020	businesses—the US military.
382020	386340	The American military presence can be found mainly on Kwajalein Atoll, which serves as
386340	391060	a key test site for the US ballistic missile defense system, among other purposes.
391060	395340	In the end, it's simple logic—the US military wants access to the Marshall Islands, the
395340	400540	Marshall Islands wants money and security, and thus, an agreement exists—the Compact
400540	401540	of Free Association.
401540	408300	So, the Compact of Free Association basically lays the foundation for the relationship between
408300	412340	the United States and the freely associated states.
412340	417680	One section of the Compact deals with the relationship between our peoples, and it allows
417680	425780	for qualified citizens to live and work and study in the United States without a visa.
425780	430740	There's another section of the Compact that generally governs economics, and it provides
430740	438220	for grants and services, all kinds of USG assistance coming to the Marshall Islands.
438220	442980	The third big section of the Compact has to do with security provisions.
442980	446460	The United States is the guarantor of security in the Marshall Islands.
446460	449820	It's difficult to overstate the significance of the Compact.
449820	454780	It's the basis of the entire modern economic and political system of the Marshals, and
454780	459420	while each of the three sections has an enormous impact on the country, perhaps none is more
459420	463640	consequential than the second—financial aid.
463640	471960	The Marshals are heavily dependent on money from donors or from the United States.
471960	478980	That's a tremendous part of the national income—upward 70-80%.
478980	484240	The US provides approximately $100 million every year to the RMI as a combination of
484240	486240	grants and services and programs.
486240	491360	Now, it's a big world out there, and there are quite a few places the US could send $100
491360	494320	million a year in exchange for military access.
494320	495420	So why here?
495420	499760	Why is there this strange partnership between one of the world's largest superpowers and
499760	502120	one of the world's smallest countries?
502120	507440	Well, like most strange things, it came as a result of millions of years of chance and
507440	508960	circumstance.
508960	514580	About 70 million years ago, 29 ancient volcanoes in what we now call the North Pacific came
514580	519760	to life and spewed out lava which quickly cooled and built up into under-ocean volcanic
519760	525680	structures until they grew so much that they emerged above water and became islands.
525680	529520	Around these islands, coral began to form, eventually coalescing into what's known
529520	533700	as a fringing coral reef, which encircled each island.
533700	538000	Time went on, the dinosaurs ruled and then died or became birds, and mammals started
538000	542600	mattering and so on and so on, and as that all happened, those islands were slowly eroding
542600	546400	and undergoing subsidence—they slowly sunk into the sea.
546400	550160	Eventually, the islands disappeared under the ocean, but the coral reefs that had formed
550160	552360	around them remained.
552360	557680	It is these 29 rings of coral, called atolls, that make up what's now known as the Marshall
557680	558680	Islands.
558680	563000	Sometime, millions of years later, but 4,000 years before today, the first Marshallese
563000	567740	settlers arrived on the islands, coming from either here, here, here, or here, or some
567740	569560	combination of those places.
569560	574180	They split the atolls into two chains—the eastern relic, or sunrise chain, and the western
574180	575980	rata, or sunset chain.
575980	580220	From those early Marshallese, eight clans emerged, of which four became dominant.
580220	584300	The Chiti conquered northern Ralic, the Arab Rajoy took southern Ralic, and the Rumiore
584300	588220	clan conquered nearly all of Ratak, but then gave nearly all of it to their offspring,
588220	589660	of the Rano clan.
589660	594180	These early Marshallese wore traditional clothing, which looked like this, lived in large community-based
594180	598180	homes, which looked like this, and practiced a religion that involved complex dances and
598180	600800	tattoos, which looked like this.
600800	604740	The first western explorers to find the Marshall Islands were Spaniards, and there were a few
604740	605740	of them.
605740	611900	The first one was this guy in 1526, then this guy in 1529, and then this guy in 1530.
611900	616580	Over the next 300 years, more explorers stopped through the Marshalls, including Frenchmen,
616580	621660	Russians, and this guy, British captain John Charles Marshall in 1788, after whom the islands
621660	623620	were named on western maps.
623620	627660	Technically, during this time, the Spanish claimed sovereignty over the Marshall Islands
627660	632060	as part of the Spanish East Indies, which included all of this, but that claim was largely
632060	633640	just theoretical.
633640	638200	The Spanish never had a formal administration, never tried to exert influence, and never
638200	642340	really even visited apart from those early explorers, whose only real impact had been
642340	645380	giving the Marshallese European diseases.
645380	649880	Much more relevant to the actual history of the Marshalls was the presence of these people,
649880	654280	Boston missionaries who first arrived in 1857 aboard the Morning Star.
654280	660320	They landed here, on Ebon Atoll, and were met by Chief Kabua, whose great-great-some-number-of-greats
660320	664560	grandson was the first president of the Marshall Islands, and whose some-greater-number-of-greats
664560	666840	grandson is the current president.
666840	670540	Chief Kabua allowed the missionaries to stay there, where they began spreading Christianity
670540	672040	throughout the islands.
672040	675960	Not only were they teaching them about this guy in this book, they also actively changed
675960	680140	Marshallese culture, even going so far as to ban traditional tattooing and dancing because
680140	683240	they referenced the traditional Marshallese religion.
683240	688120	Soon, the Marshall Islands changed even more as the first genuine western settlers, the
688120	691460	Germans, began to make residence in the islands.
691460	695720	In 1875, they signed a treaty of friendship with Chief Kabua, and developed a consulate,
695720	700160	trading posts, and economic ties, eventually buying the Marshalls from Spain in 1885, the
700160	703480	same year they worked with Chief Kabua to make the Marshall Islands an official German
703480	704480	protectorate.
704480	709860	Also, importantly, they brought in more missionaries who spread even more Christianity.
709860	715240	But then, in 1914, the Germans decided to invade here, which led to here invading here,
715240	718920	and then here invading here, and then here invading here, and then here invading here,
718920	723560	and also, not that many people paid attention to it, the Japanese invading here—the Marshall
723560	725240	Islands.
725240	730420	Japan took the Marshalls in part for strategic reasons, in part for economic reasons.
730420	736000	After all, even in the final years of German rule, they controlled over 80% of the island's
736000	737000	trade.
737000	740780	Once World War I ended and all these people got together to sign the Treaty of Versailles,
740780	745040	the Council of the League of Nations gave control of the Marshall Islands to the Japanese.
745040	749600	While in power, they expanded their administration, introduced Japanese culture, and moved about
749600	751920	1,000 Japanese citizens to the islands.
751920	756880	But then, because of some things going on here and here and also here, the Japanese
756880	761040	decided to drop bombs here, which led to the United States entering World War II and eventually
761040	764640	taking the Marshalls from the Japanese in 1944.
764640	766640	And then came this.
775040	784860	When the United States dropped atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, it began a new
784860	789600	chapter in the world's history—the nuclear age.
789600	794080	These atomic footprints on the sands of time can never be erased.
794080	801120	They point a path which leads to unparalleled progress, or unparalleled destruction.
801120	807280	Just as in the darkness of the desert morning, when the atomic age was born, atomic power
807280	817720	puts the question squarely to mankind.
817720	819160	For some, it was exciting.
819160	823660	There were mushroom cloud cakes, misatomic beauty pageants, and talk of unlimited clean
823660	828200	energy, unparalleled military dominance, and an everlasting world peace.
828200	839280	But of course, the enduring legacy of nuclear weapons is not peace or energy, but destruction.
839280	843560	And while what happened in Hiroshima and Nagasaki can be found in any book of modern history,
843560	849640	there's another chapter of the nuclear story that's told far less often—that of the
849640	851360	Marshall Islands.
851360	857760	So what happened at the end of World War II was, there had already been three nuclear
857760	863100	weapons detonated—one in New Mexico and then Hiroshima and Nagasaki.
863100	868460	But the United States at that time—not just the United States, the Russians too—they
868460	874360	wanted to increase their knowledge about the nuclear testing.
874360	878860	And so they needed a testing ground, and when they looked around the globe, they needed
878860	884060	several requirements for a proving ground for their nuclear testing.
884060	888820	Had to be out of the way of major airline and shipping routes, had to be under the control
888820	897140	of the United States, had to have a really wide area, a lagoon, to anchor the ships to
897140	899780	do the testing with—somewhere really far out of the way.
899780	903620	They looked around the map and they saw Bikini.
903620	908420	Bikini Atoll sits at the northern end of the relic chain—2.3 square miles of land encircling
908460	910980	a 229 square mile lagoon.
910980	915440	It was perfect—the right size, the right shape, the right location, and the right political
915440	919460	status as the US had been given jurisdiction over the Marshall Islands at the end of the
919460	920460	war.
920460	927020	And so, on to tiny Bikini Atoll, the United States moved in 42,000 personnel on 242 ships
927020	931540	and began to experiment with the greatest power ever unleashed by mankind.
931540	937420	First, there was the Crossroads Able Bomb—21 kilotons, far greater than Little Boy, the
937420	940220	15 kiloton bomb dropped on Hiroshima.
940220	946860	Then Crossroads Baker—23 kilotons, but these were nothing compared to what came next.
946860	954140	Castle Bravo.
954140	960180	Detonated on March 1st, 1954, this bomb produced the most powerful explosion the world had
960180	966700	ever seen—15 megatons—1,000 times more powerful than the Hiroshima bomb.
966700	972420	The United States was a triumph—the greatest example yet of nuclear technology's potential.
972420	978660	For Nerje Joseph, a neighboring Rangalap atoll, it was the start of a long nightmare.
978660	980700	My name is Nerje Joseph.
980700	982100	I come from Rangalap.
982100	988700	When I was born in Rangalap, I was in Rangalap in 1954.
988700	990860	The nuclear company.
990860	993540	Nerje was only eight on Bravo Day.
993540	997260	Today, at 74, she still remembers it vividly.
1023540	1053220	The powder, of course, was nuclear fallout.
1053220	1057500	Most pieces of coral laced with radiation had been shot up into the air and carried
1057500	1058900	by wind onto Rangalap.
1058900	1062340	But the people of Rangalap had no idea what it was.
1062340	1066380	Some of the kids even stuck their tongues out and let it fall into their mouths, thinking
1066380	1068020	it was snow.
1068020	1072980	Despite the enormous danger posed to the people of Rangalap, the US didn't evacuate them
1072980	1074860	for two days.
1074860	1079100	By that time, the radiation sickness had started to take hold.
1079100	1082940	The people of Rangalap had no idea what it was.
1082940	1085940	The people of Rangalap had no idea what it was.
1085940	1087940	The people of Rangalap had no idea what it was.
1087940	1089940	The people of Rangalap had no idea what it was.
1089940	1091940	The people of Rangalap had no idea what it was.
1091940	1093940	The people of Rangalap had no idea what it was.
1093940	1095940	The people of Rangalap had no idea what it was.
1095940	1097940	The people of Rangalap had no idea what it was.
1097940	1099940	The people of Rangalap had no idea what it was.
1099940	1101940	The people of Rangalap had no idea what it was.
1101940	1103940	The people of Rangalap had no idea what it was.
1103940	1105940	The people of Rangalap had no idea what it was.
1106780	1108780	The people of Rangalap had no idea what it was.
1108780	1110780	The people of Rangalap had no idea what it was.
1110780	1112780	The people of Rangalap had no idea what it was.
1112780	1114780	The people of Rangalap had no idea what it was.
1114780	1116780	The people of Rangalap had no idea what it was.
1116780	1118780	Of the hundreds of people on Rangalap that day,
1118780	1122780	Nirje is one of just ten who are still alive.
1122780	1124780	No one on Rangalap died that day,
1124780	1126780	but that doesn't mean the bomb didn't kill them.
1126780	1128780	Many fell victim to thyroid cancer
1128780	1130780	which has been linked to the fallout from Bravo
1130780	1133780	and none have been able to return to their home.
1134780	1135780	I…
1135780	1147180	The collateral damage of nuclear testing isn't
1147180	1149100	limited only to the people of Rongelao.
1149100	1154140	There's another group of victims, whose pain began before a single bomb was detonated—the
1154140	1157620	167 inhabitants of Bikini Atoll.
1157620	1162100	To the United States, once they'd identified Bikini as a suitable test site, its people
1162100	1165340	were more of an afterthought than an obstacle.
1165340	1169960	They asked them if they'd be willing to move for the good of mankind and to end all
1169960	1175340	world wars, and Judah, the leader of the Bikinians, just kept standing up and saying the same
1175340	1176340	answer every time.
1176340	1181140	He said, minu teimdei drudigo bienas, which is, everything's in the hands of God.
1181140	1185660	If you know what I know about Marshallese culture, if someone said to me, if I asked
1185660	1189500	them if I could do something, they said, everything's in the hands of God, that's about as much
1189500	1191740	as a no as you're ever going to get.
1191740	1192740	It's in the hands of God.
1192740	1194900	You better be careful.
1194900	1199620	But if you watch, they did 26 takes of this same shot.
1199620	1203640	The Commodore stands up and dusts off his pants and in the end he says, well, everything
1203640	1207180	being in the hands of God, it cannot be other than good.
1207180	1208180	And off he walks.
1208180	1214300	Well, you tell them and King Judah that everything being in God's hands, it cannot be other
1214300	1217180	than good.
1217180	1221180	With that, the people of Bikini were evacuated, and while they were told, of course, that
1221180	1225740	they would one day be able to return to their homes, that, like so many things the Marshalls
1225740	1229460	were told as nuclear testing began, was a lie.
1229460	1233940	After they were evacuated, the Bikinians underwent a grueling saga placed by the United States
1233940	1239260	here on uninhabited Rongorik Atoll, which they soon discovered had toxic fish and land
1239260	1240940	where nothing grew.
1240940	1245820	But I think the US looked at Rongorik and looked at Bikini, palm trees, sand, beach,
1245820	1247940	looks the same, you'll just go there.
1247940	1250940	And they drop them off there, the Bikinians, and they starve.
1250940	1255140	After two years, they were moved to tents here at Kwajalein Base, then finally here
1255140	1260380	to Kili Island, and meanwhile, with each bomb the Americans detonated, more and more of
1260380	1262740	the Bikinians' land was vaporized.
1262740	1267420	The little that remained was laced with nuclear radiation that wouldn't dissipate for thousands
1267420	1268420	of years.
1268420	1275340	In late 1960s, President Johnson, on the front page of the New York Times, on a Sunday edition,
1275340	1279920	said that Bikini was now safe on recommendations from the Atomic Energy Commission that everybody
1279920	1280920	could go back.
1280920	1286240	While they were skeptical, many were so desperate to return home that they went, choosing to
1286240	1288080	trust the Americans.
1288080	1292700	Perhaps unsurprisingly, that trust was not rewarded.
1292700	1298520	And after about eight or nine years, they discovered that the people were ingesting
1298520	1303880	the food grown on the island, and the cesium-137 radioactive element was going up into the
1303880	1308180	crops and they were eating this, so it was discovered in the late 70s that they had these
1308180	1312900	very high body versions of cesium-137, so they moved them off again and they haven't
1312900	1313900	been back since.
1313900	1320120	In the end, the United States dropped 67 nuclear bombs on the Marshall Islands.
1320120	1325180	Still today, many parts of the country show radiation levels that far exceed those of
1325180	1327420	Chernobyl.
1327420	1333400	It was really, the Cold War was fought and won by the United States on the shores of
1333400	1335560	Bikini and Eniwetok and the Marshall Islands.
1335560	1340720	We really gave a lot to the United States and the idea that it's not even talked about
1340720	1350000	is really kind of, for lack of a better word, I would say it's insulting.
1350000	1354280	As the Marshall Islands struggles to lift itself from the crater of nuclear testing,
1354280	1363720	a new threat looms—one whose capacity for destruction dwarfs that of an atomic warhead—water.
1363740	1371100	Recall for a moment the attributes of an atoll—comprised of coral, small in size, and notably narrow.
1371100	1377580	Now add to that mental picture two more tragic geological truths—atolls are extraordinarily
1377580	1384280	low-lying and exceedingly flat, which is to say, by their very nature, atolls are uniquely,
1384280	1390440	acutely susceptible to the deadly power of a rising sea.
1390440	1398480	The implications are dire for this atoll nation and similar atoll nations.
1398480	1402840	Most of the atolls of the Marshall Islands sit at less than six feet above sea level.
1402840	1409840	Marshallese homes, businesses, streets, people sit at less than six feet above sea level.
1409840	1416240	As temperatures rise and seize with them, that six feet begins to disappear fast.
1416240	1425840	Imagine an aircraft carrier that has a freeboard of perhaps, I don't know, 150 feet.
1425840	1436520	But if you lowered that freeboard to six feet and sea level rose seven feet, well, the picture
1436520	1444720	is pretty plain for anyone to imagine, and that's precisely what is predicted to happen
1444720	1448240	and what is happening gradually for atolls.
1448240	1455360	It's not just erosion, but there's actual land loss, submergence, but also the deprivation
1455360	1462520	of the use of land for any viable purpose, including simply to live on.
1462520	1471520	People who have not visited an atoll have really no concept of what it means not to
1471520	1476560	have land in an oceanic expanse as vast as the Pacific.
1476560	1481480	So any loss in land is dire.
1481480	1492960	Thirty feet of land on a high island is still significant, but 30 feet of land loss or unavailability
1492960	1499480	of land for living on is a tragedy on an atoll.
1501520	1506480	For the Marshallese, land loss isn't just devastating from a scientific perspective—it's
1506480	1510040	corrosive to the fundamental tenets of their culture.
1510040	1514540	While nearly all societies prize land, in the Marshall Islands, the relationship between
1514540	1518440	its people and land is especially precious.
1518440	1522080	You have to understand that every Marshallese is attached to a piece of land.
1522080	1526360	My kids all have, they know where their pieces of land are on Bikini, and that's their
1526360	1529840	gift from God, and that's like their anchor in life.
1529840	1534360	Marshallese people have a connection to land, not just the land but the ocean, right?
1534360	1536140	We have a connection to place.
1536140	1539820	Everybody owns land in the Marshalls, but not just that.
1539820	1548460	Every piece of land has some story, some marking, some name that's ancient, that's deep.
1548460	1554680	What happens to that knowledge if you lose that land, if you lose that connection?
1554680	1558400	What happens to who you are as a person, to our identity?
1558400	1563640	But the Marshallese, the people who settled distant atolls, who navigated through an unforgiving
1563640	1569480	sea, who endured colonization, disease, war, and 63 nuclear bombs, refused to allow their
1569480	1572680	ocean to be turned into a weapon against them.
1572680	1576400	And so, they decided to fight back, but they couldn't do it alone.
1576400	1582040	At the end of the day, Marshall Islands contributes .00001% of the world's global emissions.
1582040	1587040	It could be the most solarized island on the planet, and it would still go underwater if
1587040	1591980	the rest of the world doesn't take it into consideration and make changes, right?
1591980	1594280	So we have to fight on a global level.
1594280	1598520	What the Marshallese, through their climate activism, are fighting to defend is complex
1598520	1605080	and multifaceted—a combination of culture, tradition, soil, coral, homes, language, history,
1605080	1606080	and people.
1606080	1610720	Yet what they hope to achieve can be condensed to a single number—1.5.
1610720	1616080	1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels.
1616120	1621240	That's the magic number for the Marshallese—the limit for how much the earth can warm before
1621240	1625020	their island home becomes uninhabitable.
1625020	1629240	If global temperatures creep above 1.5, it's lights out.
1629240	1631040	Streets and houses flood.
1631040	1632440	Land disappears.
1632440	1634200	Crops die.
1634200	1640360	Above 1.5, the atolls which, for thousands of years, have supported life, transform into
1640360	1642960	engines of death.
1642960	1649040	Mitigating climate change in any meaningful way is already a nearly insurmountable endeavor—limiting
1649040	1652300	it to 1.5 would be next to impossible.
1652300	1655920	The Marshallese would face opposition from not only governments and industry, but also
1655920	1661540	from other climate change activists whose focus had long been on a different number—2.
1661540	1666520	Limiting temperature rise to 2 degrees above pre-industrial levels had, for many years,
1666520	1671040	been the aim of policy, the object of studies, and the goal of activists.
1671040	1676220	In the mainstream climate change debate, 2 wasn't the backup, the worst-case scenario,
1676220	1677220	the not-too-bad.
1677220	1681720	2 was seen as the ideal, the ambition, the gold standard.
1681720	1685800	1.5, on the other hand, was to many a pipe dream.
1685800	1690680	It was called unrealistic, impossible, a distraction, but the Marshallese knew that it was the only
1690680	1693320	way for their atolls to survive.
1693320	1698760	And it was not just the Marshalls—above 1.5, atoll nations like Tuvalu, the Maldives,
1698760	1701760	and Kiribati would face the same fate.
1701760	1709120	Among these most vulnerable countries, a motto soon emerged—1.5 to stay alive.
1709120	1714560	The fight for 1.5 would be far from easy, but they knew where it would have to be won—the
1714560	1720440	2015 United Nations Climate Change Conference in Paris, where 196 countries would come together
1720440	1724040	to develop a global plan for combating global warming.
1724040	1728560	But, before they could do that, they had to build influence.
1728560	1733120	A Marshallese government minister named Tony de Broom started building relationships and
1733120	1737400	rallying support around the world making a name for the small Marshall Islands in the
1737400	1740040	big world of climate change activism.
1740040	1744720	He represented the Marshalls at conferences and meetings all over the world—in Copenhagen,
1744720	1749400	in Doha, in Warsaw, in Lima—joining with other countries as part of the Alliance of
1749400	1751340	Small Island States.
1751340	1755380	And while de Broom made impressive progress, when it comes to geopolitics, there's only
1755380	1759860	so much influence and power that can be amassed by an atoll nation with a population lower
1759860	1761580	than most small cities.
1761580	1767260	So, he began work on a new coalition—one that could emerge at Paris to force the conversation
1767260	1770800	to 1.5—but it needed a spark.
1770800	1775900	In September 2014, that spark came, when the UN Climate Summit invited Marshallese poet
1775900	1779240	Kathy Jettnall-Kishner to speak at their opening ceremony.
1779240	1783940	With the entire nation on her shoulders, she read to the gathered leaders of the world
1783940	1786860	a letter she had written to her newborn daughter.
1814660	1819680	Dear Mata Felipe, I want to tell you about that lagoon.
1819680	1823340	That lazy lounging lagoon lounging against the sunrise.
1823340	1827840	Men say that one day that lagoon will devour you.
1827840	1832180	They say it will gnaw at the shoreline, chew at the roots of your red fruit trees, gulp
1832180	1836980	down rows of seawalls, and crunch through your island's shattered bones.
1837020	1844660	They say you, your daughter, and your granddaughter, too, will wander, ruthless, with only a passport
1844660	1846900	to call home.
1846900	1850140	Dear Mata Felipe, don't cry.
1850140	1852220	No one's drowning, baby.
1852220	1853680	No one's moving.
1853680	1855820	No one's losing their homeland.
1855820	1860300	No one's becoming a climate change refugee.
1860300	1863940	Or should I say, no one else.
1863940	1869220	To the Carteret Islanders of Papua New Guinea and to the Tarot Islanders of Fiji, I take
1869220	1872520	this moment to apologize to you.
1872520	1877720	We are drawing the line here because we, baby, are going to fight.
1877720	1883500	Your mommy, daddy, boo-boo, Jima, your country, and your president, too, we will all fight.
1883500	1889260	And even though there are those hidden behind platinum titles who like to pretend that we
1889260	1895580	don't exist, who like to pretend that the Marshall Islands, Tuvalu, Kiribati, Maldives,
1895580	1901820	Typhoon Haiyan in the Philippines, floods of Algeria, Colombia, Pakistan, and all the hurricanes,
1901820	1911740	earthquakes, and tidal waves didn't exist, still, there are those who see us, hands reaching
1911740	1920140	out, fists raising up, banners unfurling, megaphones booming, and we are canoes blocking
1920140	1921140	coal ships.
1921140	1923980	We are the radiance of solar villages.
1923980	1927860	We are the fresh, clean soil of the farmer's past.
1927860	1931040	We are teenagers, blooming petitions.
1931040	1937260	We are families, biking, recycling, reusing, engineers, building, dreaming, designing,
1937260	1943060	artists, painting, dancing, writing, and we are spreading the word.
1943060	1948820	And there are thousands out on the streets, marching hand in hand, chanting for change
1948820	1949820	now.
1949820	1953500	And they're marching for you, baby.
1953500	1960060	They're marching for us because we deserve to do more than just survive.
1960060	1963020	We deserve to thrive.
1963020	1969980	Dear Mata Felipe, you are eyes heavy with drowsy weight, so just close those eyes and
1969980	1972140	sleep in peace.
1972140	1977420	Because we won't let you down, you'll see.
1977420	1980940	Standing ovations aren't common at the United Nations.
1980940	1985860	Kathy's lasted a full minute.
1985860	1991220	Why do you think poetry is an effective means of activism?
1991220	1996340	What is it about poetry that you think makes people listen?
1996340	2000580	Well I think poetry forces people to slow down and connect to the emotion of the issue,
2000580	2001580	right?
2001580	2009440	Rather than just facts and data and fear and, you know, written statements, right?
2009440	2010840	Poetry is personal.
2010840	2015160	Poetry connects you to the issue and connects you to why you should care about the issue.
2015160	2018100	And then, it was time to go to Paris.
2018100	2023340	The Paris conference lasted 14 days, and for the first 11, nearly all discussion centered
2023340	2025320	around two degrees.
2025320	2030180	But in the final three days of negotiation, Tony de Broom began to execute his plan when
2030180	2036380	he unveiled the High Ambition Coalition—a previously secret alliance of over 90 countries
2036380	2039760	that Tony had spent the last year coalescing.
2039760	2044880	The High Ambition Coalition ranged from the small atoll of Kiribati to the powerful nations
2044880	2050080	of the European Union and together, they turned the entire conference on its head,
2050080	2053640	demanding the agreement include 1.5.
2053640	2058220	It was such a jarring and extraordinary show of power orchestrated by such a small nation
2058220	2061040	that many said it couldn't be real.
2061040	2065000	Chinese negotiators called it meaningless, representatives from Bangladesh called it
2065000	2071440	a stunt, and in truth, it was not completely clear just how formal this coalition was—unpressed,
2071440	2073960	Tony couldn't even say how many members it had.
2074040	2077680	But it didn't matter, because the momentum had already changed.
2077680	2082880	New countries began to join—Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Iceland, Sweden.
2082880	2087560	Before long, a majority of the represented nations supported 1.5.
2087560	2094080	In less than three days, Tony de Broom took 1.5 from pipe dream to reality.
2094080	2099600	In the end, 184 countries resolved that they would, quote, hold the increase in the global
2099600	2104440	temperature to well below 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels and pursue efforts
2104440	2109680	to limit the temperature increase to 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels.
2109680	2112480	They got 1.5 in there, right?
2112480	2120120	1.5, huge for us, the global temperature, you know, to maintain our survival.
2120120	2124800	Before we went to that conference, I was told by many people that 1.5 wouldn't make it
2124800	2125800	in there.
2125800	2127520	It was too hard.
2127520	2130640	Even though for our survival, we need that temperature to be recognized.
2130640	2134280	Yeah, Tony was the one that orchestrated that.
2134280	2140760	And so beyond that, you know, we've also continued that momentum from Tony's legacy
2140760	2141760	once he passed on.
2141760	2150560	Yes, we were kind of a champion for climate change in the Paris meeting, you know, by
2150560	2159080	working with a group of people, which was called the Eye Ambition Group.
2159080	2166080	And it was kind of amazing for us to be able to gather a number of people who supported
2166080	2172000	us during the meetings and resulted in the Paris Accord.
2172000	2178480	It was an enormous, unexpected, deserved victory, but it didn't last.
2178480	2182520	The Paris Agreement was, without a doubt, the most important collective step the world
2182520	2184920	had made towards solving climate change.
2184920	2189680	It was also, in many ways, a complete and utter failure.
2189680	2193800	Many of the pledges made by countries were unspecific, unambitious, and perhaps most
2193800	2196080	importantly, unenforceable.
2196080	2201760	In Paris, the world promised to pursue efforts to limit temperatures to 1.5.
2201760	2205000	Already in 2015, it was a weak promise.
2205000	2208040	The five years since have proved it meaningless.
2208080	2212440	Paris was supposed to serve as a starting place, with more ambitious pledges to be made
2212440	2213440	in the future.
2213440	2219100	Now, it is the future, and the more ambitious pledges are nowhere to be found.
2219100	2224480	And even the inadequate commitments of Paris have often been completely ignored.
2224480	2227920	In stories, the underdog is supposed to win.
2227920	2233000	When they give it their all, when they combine dreams and drive, when they form a high ambition
2233000	2237920	coalition, when they read Dear Mattaffé le Penem, when they chant 1.5 to stay alive,
2237920	2240320	it's supposed to work.
2240320	2247600	Today, projections show that under the best case scenario, we'll reach 1.5 in 2052.
2247600	2249840	Worst case, 2030.
2249840	2256320	Either way, in a few short decades, three millennia of marshally civilization will come
2256320	2259600	to an end.
2259600	2264480	Currently today, flooding and inundation are common in the Marshall Islands, but things
2264480	2269160	get especially bad during what the marshallese call King Tides.
2269160	2276280	The islands are becoming more and more inundated with waters during spring tide and also during
2276280	2277320	king's tide.
2277320	2283880	When the high tide, king tide comes, it destroys the whole village, the water comes to the
2283880	2284880	road.
2284880	2287760	My cousin lost her house in a really bad king tide flooding.
2287760	2290960	Since 2011, we've seen more and more king tides.
2290960	2297280	A combination of lunar cycles, wind patterns, and of course, rising seas coalesce into waves
2297280	2300120	that flood streets, yards, and homes.
2300120	2305600	For the marshallese, the destruction and disorder king tides bring have become an increasingly
2305600	2307680	normal part of everyday life.
2307680	2313680	We're flat as a pancake here and if you go out today, 545's the high tide, you know
2313680	2314680	why I know that?
2315200	2318200	Because yesterday I was driving home a little after five and the water was splashing, I
2318200	2324080	drive Volkswagens, the water splashing on a, salt water splashing on a Volkswagon is
2324080	2327360	not a good feeling because they melt with the rust.
2327360	2331080	And so I knew today, I always know when the high tide is because I worry about that kind
2331080	2332080	of stuff.
2332080	2334700	But other people worry about it too because it's hitting their houses.
2334700	2337840	You never used to know when high tides were out unless you were someone who was out at
2337840	2342160	the sea all the time and you were a diver or whatever and you counted on that stuff.
2342160	2345000	Now everybody kind of knows when the big high tide is going to be and they know what
2345000	2346000	they have to do.
2346000	2348440	We never used to think like that here, ever.
2348440	2353000	Flooding and inundation don't just destroy what's been created on the atoll.
2353000	2356720	It also destroys the atoll's ability to create.
2356720	2366040	The water is coming up on the ground too and also contaminating our well waters and affecting
2366040	2368600	our food crops.
2368600	2373520	And of course the breadfruit trees that we used to depend on to build our canoes and
2373520	2381360	provide food are dying because the water lengths on these islands are getting smaller and smaller
2381360	2384360	and they cannot survive the salt water.
2384360	2389920	But the most pressing effect of climate change is also perhaps the most unexpected.
2389920	2394400	So currently the most urgent effects are illnesses.
2394400	2397200	So climate-related illnesses like dengue.
2397200	2401200	Mosquito-borne illnesses are supposed to increase with climate effects.
2401200	2405500	So we have three different health issues we're dealing with right now on the Marshall Islands.
2405500	2409960	The first of course is dengue fever that's been going on for about eight months now.
2409960	2412840	We've been in a state of health emergency.
2412840	2423680	The second one is, we've had over 25 cases, 2500 cases of dengue since last July.
2423680	2427320	And so that's been our major battle we're fighting right here now.
2427320	2431380	And then secondly, we've had measles, which we haven't had a case yet, but we've put
2431380	2433640	in all kinds of preventative measures.
2433640	2437000	And of course coronavirus in the same category, we're just trying to prevent it.
2437000	2441200	We haven't had any yet, but we're being very strict with how people come in.
2441200	2447120	Actually the way I feel is that most of what we're seeing right now is climate change,
2447120	2449120	the result of climate change.
2449120	2453480	With rising temperatures come more mosquitoes, increasing the risk of transmission for insect
2453480	2456360	borne diseases like Zika and dengue.
2456360	2461100	More severe water cycles—flooding, high rainfalls, drought—all propagate contaminated
2461100	2466740	water supplies, increasing the spread of cholera, E. coli, and other diarrheal diseases.
2466740	2472760	In fact, for almost every infectious disease out there—malaria, Ebola, Lyme, West Nile,
2472760	2477000	typhoid—research predicts that climate change will make it worse.
2477000	2482360	According to the World Health Organization, over the next 20 years, over 2 million people
2482480	2487040	will die as a result of climate change related disease.
2487040	2488480	This is like not normal.
2488480	2491280	This is not nothing that we've ever experienced before.
2491280	2493560	We're in the eighth month of a state of health emergency.
2493560	2497300	The Marshall Islands has never been in a state of health emergency this long ever.
2497300	2499840	We've never seen a bigger disease outbreak.
2499840	2503820	We've never seen all these deaths throughout the Pacific in recent times from things like
2503820	2505980	measles that we thought were gone.
2505980	2511360	So I think the really important thing that people have to understand is this is not the
2511360	2516160	way things used to be, but this is the way it's becoming now normal.
2516160	2520520	And that to me is a result of the massive climate change and the massive warming that's
2520520	2521560	been going on.
2521560	2527320	You have to start talking about health and connecting it to climate change because there's
2527320	2529240	no other explanation for this.
2529240	2530360	There really isn't.
2530360	2535920	When you combine it all—inundation, land loss, crop death, coral bleaching, drought,
2535920	2540220	disease—a single, clear picture forms.
2540220	2545880	These are all becoming a potent package which are linked to the adverse effects of climate
2545880	2546880	change.
2546880	2554140	And that potency is a bit too much or beyond the capability of small atoll nations to respond
2554140	2555140	to.
2555140	2563360	And so all of these packaged, potent adverse effects are proving to be catastrophic.
2563360	2569460	The future that the Marshall Islands fought so hard to prevent is already coming to pass.
2569460	2579680	The islands are dying, and soon, they'll be truly, permanently, and irreversibly uninhabitable.
2579680	2585980	Two options have emerged—stay and fight a losing battle, or leave and start a new
2585980	2586980	life.
2586980	2589500	In truth, though, those options are the same.
2589500	2592980	The only variable is time.
2592980	2598740	Thousands of miles away, far from the fury of the ocean, a new atoll is emerging.
2598740	2604840	One encircled not by sea, but by streets—a land made not of coral, but of concrete.
2604840	2609520	One where abundance is measured not by the size of your family, but rather the sum of
2609520	2610520	your money.
2610520	2614160	One dotted not by palm trees, but by poultry plants.
2614160	2619200	Hope is not plentiful for the Marshallese, but there's a spark of it here, nestled
2619200	2622540	in the northwestern corner of Arkansas.
2622540	2628160	Springdale is, I would describe it as more of a blue-collar, working-class community
2628160	2634240	in the midst of a thriving area of northwest Arkansas, one of the top five fastest growing
2634240	2635360	areas in the country.
2635360	2636640	We are a very diverse city.
2636640	2639600	We've got 44 languages spoken in our school district.
2639600	2648200	Our two largest minorities would be Latino, which is probably somewhere around 35 to 40
2648200	2649200	percent.
2649200	2650200	Could be a little higher.
2650200	2656720	We'll find out in the 2020 census, and a large Marshallese population.
2656720	2662400	We've been told the largest Marshallese population outside of the Marshall Islands.
2662400	2667800	Exact figures vary—2010 census numbers peg it in the low thousands, but that figure is
2667800	2669920	almost certainly inaccurate.
2669920	2675760	In reality, currently, it is believed that as many as 15,000 Marshallese live in the
2675760	2682920	Springdale area—one fifth of all Marshallese people tucked away in this small Ozark city.
2682920	2688560	Of course, in a country of countless options, the question to some might be, why Springdale,
2688560	2689560	Arkansas?
2689560	2693800	The story, as it's told, begins in 1979.
2693800	2699600	A Marshallese man named John Moody was awarded a scholarship to the University of Oklahoma—a
2699600	2703240	dream coming from a nation yet to have a single college.
2703240	2707020	Moody soon decided, though, that he wasn't cut out for the academic life.
2707020	2711680	He shifted paths, taking a job at a poultry plant in Muskogee, Oklahoma, earning $3.25
2712040	2716640	an hour—multiples more than any comparable job in the Marshalls.
2716640	2721200	Soon, though, the business took him to the largest poultry producer in the world, Tyson
2721200	2724840	Foods, headquartered in Springdale, Arkansas.
2724840	2729480	Pay was decent, openings were plentiful, and English was optional, so word soon traveled
2729480	2735260	from Moody to his family in the Marshalls that Springdale was the land of opportunity.
2735260	2739920	So they came, and spread the word to others, and they came, and spread the word, and more
2739920	2745200	came, and spread the word, and soon enough, as the social networks of a small nation saturated
2745200	2750240	with the promise of a better life, Springdale established itself as the destination for
2750240	2753000	Marshallese immigration to the US.
2753000	2758880	Now, decades on, what started as one man in a chicken plant has turned into the largest
2758880	2762960	population of Marshallese outside of the islands themselves.
2762960	2767680	The city has 30-odd Marshallese churches, has become a key campaign stop for Marshallese
2767680	2772200	politicians, and it's even home to a tiny consulate representing the Marshallese government
2772200	2773620	itself.
2773620	2777640	The mission is one of just eight the Marshalls have abroad.
2777640	2781800	Sharing a modest two-story building with a barber, accountant, and lawyer, it is the
2781800	2787080	only consulate of any nation for hundreds of miles and one of only two in the state
2787080	2788080	of Arkansas.
2788080	2794160	It's staffed just by an assistant, the consul's wife, and the consul general himself.
2794160	2795160	My name is Eldon Alik.
2795160	2799520	I'm the consul general for the Republic of the Marshall Islands here in Springdale,
2799520	2800520	Arkansas.
2800520	2805680	The job of the consul is to, number one, provide consul services to the Marshallese citizens
2805680	2812400	here, and assist the Marshallese population here with whatever they need.
2812400	2817240	Try to be the eyes and ears of the government of the Marshall Islands here.
2817240	2821960	Call it luck or call it intuition, but Moody and the thousands that followed were right
2821960	2824640	to choose Springdale as their new homes.
2824640	2829120	The city has been experiencing a decades-long economic boom.
2829120	2835680	We have an entrepreneurial spirit here in northwest Arkansas, not only Springdale, but
2835680	2844560	we've seen many Fortune 100 companies, Walmart, of course, about 30 miles north.
2844560	2851560	We've got Tyson right here in Springdale, which is the first or second largest protein
2851560	2853120	producer in the world.
2853120	2859280	We have, because of our growth, certainly the building industry, the building trades.
2859280	2865060	There's a lot going on here that, you know, our unemployment right now is just barely
2865060	2867520	over 2% in Springdale.
2867520	2872240	Pretty much anyone who wants one, no matter their age, origin, or education level, can
2872240	2874280	get a job in Springdale.
2874280	2878840	Well, Marshallese, we generally like to follow one another.
2878840	2881120	We come here to be near our families.
2881120	2885560	The poultry industry doesn't really take a lot of skills and education.
2885560	2886840	People just come here and they can work.
2886840	2889240	They're going to arrive today and work tomorrow.
2889240	2893640	Under the Compact of Free Association, any Marshallese citizen can live and work in the
2893640	2900000	US—a right others, at best, wait years or decades to attain.
2900000	2901920	But there are still barriers.
2901920	2905600	Perhaps the most significant is the first—getting there.
2905600	2912240	A one-way plane ticket from Majuro to Springdale costs about $1,500—a substantial sum for
2912240	2915680	anyone but a fortune in the Marshall Islands.
2915680	2919680	There, $1,500 is half a year's wage.
2919680	2923720	In Springdale, though, $1,500 is less than a month's.
2923720	2927320	Some families, they come here little by little.
2927320	2932120	Sometimes they just send the father first, and then the mother, and then the kids, and
2932120	2934120	then the parents, the grandparents.
2934480	2936480	So they just do little by little.
2936480	2942640	Each earns enough to pay for the next, over time bringing the entire family to Springdale.
2942640	2949960	So we did a study, and the majority of the people that actually took the study replied
2949960	2956040	that family responsibility was the first reason why they moved.
2956040	2962520	You know, and usually their departure from the islands are very, very unplanned.
2962520	2967600	That's because, you know, a sister would call in and say, hey, I have some money.
2967600	2969600	I have some money to buy you a ticket.
2969600	2970600	Get ready.
2970600	2975400	You're going to be on the plane in the next two weeks, so you can come and help me with
2975400	2978880	my mom or, you know, with someone so I can find a job.
2978880	2984640	And while you take care of the family member, you know, I have a way to bring income into
2984640	2985640	the house.
2985640	2989960	Despite their political, economic, and social connections, though, the Marshall Islands
2989960	2994680	and the United States are not the same, and the adjustment is not always easy.
2994680	3002280	There are just so many cultural barriers that we see on a daily basis.
3002280	3009040	One is, Marshallese culture is a very sharing culture, you know, one property is owned by
3009040	3010040	everyone.
3010040	3016640	It's just not individual ownership of their property, but, you know, everyone in that
3016640	3018840	clan owns it.
3018840	3026560	And when you look in terms of households, it is perfectly okay for multiple family members
3026560	3033280	to live under one roof, whereas, you know, here, you know, you have those, the enforced
3033280	3035440	codes where it's prohibited.
3035440	3041600	You know, I don't know what the codes of ordinances in the Marshall Islands look like, but I can
3041600	3045580	be pretty confident they're quite a bit different than ours here in Springdale, Arkansas.
3045580	3053880	We came from a world that money really didn't mean anything for us, but here it is.
3053880	3058700	People in the United States, they were economically driven, whereas we're not.
3058700	3060680	We never had to pay rent.
3060680	3068040	We never have to worry about having a lot of money so we can buy food because, you know,
3068040	3073460	you have our biggest refrigerator was the ocean, and it was right there, is readily
3073460	3074460	available.
3074460	3076620	So we really didn't have to worry about saving.
3076620	3080500	You're comparing a very small world to a big world.
3080500	3086300	Nonetheless, in making the difficult transition to America, having a familiar community makes
3086300	3087300	it easier.
3087300	3090340	You're surrounded by over 35 churches.
3090340	3092080	That's amazing.
3092080	3097180	And you have a consul general's office here, you have our office as well, you have other
3097180	3100060	non-profit offices as well.
3100060	3105900	And the people are very supportive in this area, very supportive of the Marshallese community.
3105900	3113460	It kind of like gives you that value in preserving your culture and I think that's why I refer
3113460	3120380	Springdale to as Springdale 8 Holes because this is really the culture, this is the hub
3120380	3123260	of the culture.
3123260	3128100	Popular media might predict that the story of a group of people from a far-off land descending
3128100	3133780	on and settling a small southern city would end in tension and animosity.
3133780	3136620	That is not the story of Springdale.
3136620	3140580	You know, I wish I knew what the secret sauce was for that because I think we could use
3140580	3147820	that in a lot of places throughout our country, this openness and willingness to accept change.
3147820	3149860	And I don't want to candy-coat it.
3149860	3154620	There are other people who grew up here just like me that continue to talk about the good
3154620	3159180	old days and the days when we grew up and things were different.
3159180	3163520	But you know, I'm just reminded that we're somebody's good old days right now.
3163520	3167920	The people growing up here right now will look back on this time as the good old days
3167920	3170780	no matter what it looks like.
3170780	3178460	And so I think a willingness on the part of the people of Springdale to treat people as
3178460	3182980	human beings, surely there's nothing special about Springdale.
3182980	3186500	Probably everyone, every place can do that.
3186500	3190620	Springdale, as it exists for the Marshallese, is fortuitous.
3190620	3195100	Fortuitous because John Moody and the early migrants who followed had no idea of their
3195100	3196740	island's bleak fate.
3196740	3202180	They migrated for a brighter economic future, but now, with the direct threat of a rising
3202180	3206620	ocean, Marshallese are starting to migrate to escape the water.
3206620	3211380	I think some people have a, well, because obviously they have a rice, and that wasn't
3211380	3214540	the case maybe five, ten years ago.
3214540	3218860	People were coming here for better opportunities, but I've talked to some people and they've
3218860	3221500	come here for sea level rise.
3221500	3228740	Plan A is staying and live there and fight, fight the climate change, but if Plan A doesn't
3228740	3232740	work, you know, this is where I feel the calling.
3232740	3234660	This is where I need to be at.
3234660	3242060	And if really, if that happens, that's, wow, that's taking away our identity, you know,
3242060	3245780	that's basically stripping us down to the bare skin.
3245780	3247460	And I'm not sure how I'm going to take that.
3247460	3250620	That will be very hard for me to process.
3250620	3258580	However, I feel that I can't just cry and feel sad because that happened.
3258580	3259820	I have to do something.
3259820	3262180	I have to make, reestablish.
3262180	3269180	I feel like reestablishing somewhere else that is safe, that provides you the freedom,
3269180	3275580	the freedom to make a choice, is probably my next thing that I will focus on.
3275580	3278840	Plan A is still very much in motion for many.
3278840	3283060	Most Marshallese are still at their home, fighting to hold on to their lives as long
3283060	3288000	as the waters will allow them—those who can buy a few additional years by building
3288000	3290140	a wall between them and the ocean.
3290740	3294900	Well, we call this, we call this a concrete wall.
3294900	3304940	So we, first we build the concrete base about five to six feet wide and two feet from the,
3304940	3306300	from the ground.
3306300	3312380	When the high tide come, not even normal like other, other dive wounds.
3312380	3318700	And after I build wall there, people there, they're living happy there.
3318700	3327860	I see, I see that the seawall has been protecting them, but there's other people, same village.
3327860	3334980	The other people live on the other side, about two, two houses from the outside of the seawall.
3334980	3337900	Now they're affecting because there's no wall there.
3337900	3343740	If wall wasn't here, there's no wall here.
3343780	3351580	I know that the water, the trash, the rocks, they were coming right here.
3351580	3355220	They're going, want to, how many houses there?
3355220	3356220	Yeah.
3356220	3359540	And it's been happening over, it's been happening over and over.
3359540	3363300	Every kick tide's coming, they're always like that.
3363300	3366300	They're bringing rocks and trash.
3366300	3371540	Do you think seawalls could protect Majuro for 200 years, 300 years?
3371540	3372540	Oh no.
3374140	3375140	Don't trust me.
3375140	3380860	Believe me, even though we're making wall, it's not going to protect because we're damaging
3380860	3381860	the reef.
3381860	3389140	And if, as long as you trill the reef and building concrete wall, you're messing with
3389140	3390820	the mother nature, you know?
3390820	3396620	At this point, the goal is not to prevent the destruction of the marshals, just to delay
3396620	3397820	it.
3397900	3404900	If the time limit is in five years, then, you know, we move five years.
3404900	3411580	But between now and five years, we want to make sure that we spend every minute thinking
3411580	3415860	about how to survive on these islands, just like our ancestor did.
3415860	3419540	Land is supposed to be the embodiment of permanence.
3419540	3425580	A nation is nothing without its land, but now the Marshall Islands is temporary.
3425580	3430500	In the back of everyone's mind is the realization that the soil they stand on will eventually
3430500	3431500	be submerged.
3431500	3435860	You know, with our infrastructure projects, you know, what are we doing?
3435860	3440300	Why are we doing this, you know, 20, 30, 40 years?
3440300	3441740	Could be swamped under water.
3441740	3447820	I don't know, it's like, you know, part of the work you do is try to prepare for the,
3447820	3452980	you know, the future of submerging.
3452980	3457020	And part of it is you just carry on with your day-to-day activities, which means, you know,
3457020	3460860	look, these projects are still funded, they're on the books, they're approved, we still got
3460860	3462860	to do them.
3462860	3465380	Now, when is that going to change?
3465380	3467500	I don't know.
3467500	3468500	I don't know.
3468500	3473700	It's going to take some kind of visible tipping point somewhere then, I think, for that to
3473700	3474700	happen.
3474700	3480860	I mean, really, I mean, significant, not just a high king tide, you know, we've had those.
3480860	3481860	Or another El Nino.
3481860	3482860	Again, we've had those.
3482860	3490300	I think it's going to take something else maybe, unfortunately, maybe worse for us to,
3490300	3499020	I don't know, then get to the realization, well, this is it, you know, we've got to stop
3499020	3507020	and just have a new web activity and divert the energies into some other kind of future.
3507020	3512980	Well, when you think, when people say to me that they think the Marshall Islands has
3512980	3518860	a time limit, I think they have to start thinking about the bigger picture here.
3518860	3521180	We're the canary in the coal mine.
3521180	3524820	If we have a limited time here, then so does everywhere else.
3524820	3528200	I mean, this is the way, this is the way it's evolving.
3528200	3531020	And so many times we've been the canary out there.
3531020	3535020	We're the canary in the coal mine for nuclear testing.
3535020	3537740	Now we're the canary in the coal mine for climate change.
3537740	3546340	The reason why this, our ocean is mad and is crawling closer to our living room is because
3546340	3551980	the same people that brought in the nuclear testing to the country are the same people
3551980	3553580	that are doing this.
3553580	3556080	They're trying to find resource.
3556080	3561500	First they tried to find the power to control the world and using our islands to test the
3561500	3563260	nuclear weapon.
3563260	3569060	Then they went back and tried to find the best way to gain resources in a short period
3569060	3577060	of time by using things that would destroy the world and our mother nature is not happy
3577060	3581280	so she's coming back to us, but in a very roaring way.
3581280	3586260	We as Marshallese people enter the conversation of climate change as survivors of the nuclear
3586260	3590420	legacy, as in we already understand what it means to have lost homes, to have lost that
3590420	3595660	connection to land, to have something ripped away from us for global, because of global
3595660	3600100	needs and you know, because of a global concern or whatever, right?
3600100	3604360	The US decided to test nuclear weapons in the Marshall Islands because we were seen
3604360	3609220	as disposable and now with climate change happening, more or less and less people care
3609220	3610220	about it.
3610220	3613900	You know, there are very few people who care about it and the ones in power don't care
3613900	3617420	about it because again, we're seen as disposable.
3617420	3621060	That's the intersection between climate change and the nuclear legacy.
3621060	3624540	We've experienced it already and that's why we're fighting even harder against climate
3624540	3625540	change.
3625540	3627060	We don't want to lose the rest of our islands.
3627060	3630360	We've already experienced that loss and that trauma.
3630360	3633700	We are going to be the first climate change refugees.
3633700	3636540	I truly believe that.
3636540	3643960	That's happening and people are in denial of it because they're responsible for it.
3643960	3646180	This is my country.
3646180	3647180	This is where I live.
3647180	3648820	This is where my kids go to school.
3648820	3654540	This is where I want them to all be and this is the society I want them to contribute to.
3654540	3660780	I think it's, you know, it's a tough concept to think about.
3660780	3664280	It's like thinking, if you have children, thinking about them being in a car accident
3664280	3667000	or getting a terminal illness.
3667000	3669420	You don't want to think about it because it's so painful.
3669420	3685600	You know, we love our culture, we love our custom and we love the way of life that we
3685600	3686600	have here.
3686600	3692860	If we were to leave, go somewhere else, we would probably lose our custom, we would probably
3692860	3697580	lose our ability to look after ourselves as a people.
3697580	3701400	Right now, it's still a debate in many of these First World nations.
3701400	3702400	What do we do?
3702400	3703400	Can we do it?
3703400	3704780	What are the changes we can make?
3704780	3705780	Do we believe in it?
3705780	3706780	Is it even real?
3706780	3708140	Is it worth the funding?
3708140	3709140	Can we change?
3709140	3710140	That's not where we're at.
3710140	3713040	Where we're at is very much, it's going to happen.
3713040	3715120	We have to figure out how to plan for it.
3715120	3721980	We probably will be looking back at our country from a higher ground.
3721980	3729140	This is going to be, wow, this is going to be something that I just can't describe in
3729140	3738060	terms of culturally, as a people, civilization, what this is going to mean for the kids and
3738060	3742500	grandkids.
3742500	3747740	To be honest, I'm worried about my generation and the next generation and the future on
3747740	3755940	because when we migrate, the main thing I'm scared of is our culture.
3755940	3758980	If everyone leaves here, where will our culture go?
3758980	3766140	Our culture will slowly fade away and no one knows about our culture, our people, and especially
3766140	3767140	Marshall Islands.
3767140	3776260	Yeah, it hits me every time, but I really try to ignore it, but I can't because it's
3776260	3777260	always trending.
3777260	3783420	It's always getting talked about and we really can't put it aside because we're really affected
3783420	3790340	now and if we can't do anything now, the future will be affected if we don't do anything now.
3790340	3793980	Personally, me, I really don't want to go to other countries.
3793980	3801300	I really want to stay here and live the best life in the islands and really share the full
3801300	3805680	of joy right here in the Marshall Islands.
3805680	3811460	This island really means a lot and just imagine if different countries, if we told them that
3811460	3817180	their country doesn't matter and they can just move here and they would feel the same
3817180	3822520	way that it feels special for us to have this place because it's unique and our culture
3822520	3833100	really lies here.
3833100	3841740	People can move, a nation cannot, and though they'll try, any transposition loses fidelity.
3841740	3847400	With each generation, the pictures fuzzy, the memories fade.
3847400	3852980	The Marshall Islands has endured for millennia, but it was never immortal.
3852980	3857300	Nations have ended before, nations will end again.
3857300	3862800	Of all the ends the Marshall Islands could meet, though, this one stings most.
3862800	3870480	To be killed by the ocean, its creator, turned against it by people who don't even know its name.
3892800	3899800	You're not alone, you're not alone, you're not alone, you're not alone, you're not alone, you're not alone.
3922800	3924860	you
