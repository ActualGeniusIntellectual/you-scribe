Start learning complex STEM subjects simply by going to brilliant.org slash wendover.

00:10.140 --> 00:12.100
The idea is simple.

00:12.100 --> 00:16.720
You take what Southwest, Ryanair, Wizz Air, and countless other low-cost airlines have

00:16.720 --> 00:20.860
done with short-haul flying, and apply it to the long-haul market.

00:20.860 --> 00:22.940
You make long-haul flying cheap.

00:22.940 --> 00:27.640
That's the concept behind low-cost, long-haul airlines.

00:27.640 --> 00:32.640
To make that actually work, however, has proved a little more difficult.

00:32.640 --> 00:37.640
Now, the underlying recipe behind low-cost short-haul airlines by the like of Ryanair

00:37.640 --> 00:42.980
and low-cost long-haul airlines such as Norwegian Airlines looks the same on the surface—one

00:42.980 --> 00:47.920
just flies longer routes than the other—but the result has been markedly different.

00:47.920 --> 00:53.080
Ryanair is one of the most profitable airlines in the world—Norwegian has been operating

00:53.080 --> 00:56.080
deeply in the red for years.

00:56.080 --> 01:01.080
Low-cost short-haul airlines have upended the global aviation industry.

01:01.080 --> 01:05.840
Low-cost long-haul airlines have failed, and failed, and failed again.

01:05.840 --> 01:12.040
In 2019 alone, Wow Air, June, Églazur, Thomas Cook, and XL Airlines all went under, all

01:12.040 --> 01:14.920
after operating under this business model.

01:14.920 --> 01:18.940
In fact, globally, there are only about a dozen airlines currently operating using this

01:18.940 --> 01:23.880
business model after scores more have tried over the decades.

01:23.880 --> 01:28.560
These few survivors, though, are not all failures hanging on to their last fragments

01:28.560 --> 01:29.840
of life.

01:29.840 --> 01:35.840
Over the past five years, before the COVID-induced travel downturn, Condor, Cebu Pacific, Azul

01:35.840 --> 01:41.320
Airlines, Jetstar, TUI, Scoot, and WestJet have each operated long-haul, low-cost flights

01:41.320 --> 01:44.240
at varying levels, but earned a profit.

01:44.240 --> 01:50.480
Meanwhile, though, AirAsia X, Norwegian Airlines, Eurowings, and countless now-bankrupt low-cost

01:50.480 --> 01:53.400
long-haul airlines operated at a loss.

01:53.400 --> 01:57.000
So, considering some can do it, why can't they all?

01:57.000 --> 02:02.560
What's the secret sauce to a profitable, long-haul, low-cost airline?

02:02.560 --> 02:08.720
Well, these are the 14 measurable characteristics that might impact the profitability of a given

02:08.720 --> 02:10.960
long-haul, low-cost airline.

02:10.960 --> 02:15.400
These are ten currently or recently operating long-haul, low-cost airlines that report independent

02:15.400 --> 02:20.320
financial results, and these are each of those 14 characteristics quantified for each of

02:20.320 --> 02:24.720
those ten airlines, based on data before the coronavirus pandemic started.

02:24.720 --> 02:30.160
Now, for most of these characteristics, there's quite a lot of variability from airline to

02:30.160 --> 02:35.200
airline—each company clearly has its own hypothesis for the correct formula that might

02:35.200 --> 02:38.120
make low-cost long-haul travel possible.

02:38.120 --> 02:42.600
For example, in terms of number of hubs, defined as the number of distinct origins their flights

02:42.600 --> 02:49.360
operate from, TUI has 18 spread out across Europe, while AirAsia X has just one, Kuala

02:49.360 --> 02:50.360
Lumpur.

02:50.360 --> 02:54.560
Meanwhile, in the category of the average number of route competitors, defined as how

02:54.560 --> 02:59.200
many other airlines operate the same long-haul routes as the subject airline, TUI had the

02:59.200 --> 03:03.640
least, meaning that for almost all of their routes, they were the only airline to operate

03:03.640 --> 03:08.240
it, while Cebu Pacific had the most, meaning that they typically had multiple competitors

03:08.240 --> 03:10.160
on each of their routes.

03:10.160 --> 03:14.920
Now, by performing regression analysis, the data suggests that most of these characteristics

03:14.920 --> 03:17.720
have very little correlation to profitability.

03:17.720 --> 03:22.080
For example, you might think, like many in the industry, that long-haul low-cost carriers

03:22.080 --> 03:26.160
would benefit from having younger, more fuel-efficient aircraft.

03:26.160 --> 03:31.920
Norwegian Airlines, though, has an average aircraft age of just 2.3 years, but it's

03:31.920 --> 03:36.680
deeply unprofitable, while Condor, on the other hand, has an average aircraft age of

03:36.680 --> 03:40.840
24 years, and yet it's the most profitable airline of these ten.

03:40.840 --> 03:45.360
Of course, then there's Eurowings, with the second oldest fleet, and yet it's also

03:45.360 --> 03:46.680
deeply unprofitable.

03:46.680 --> 03:51.440
Essentially, the data suggest that aircraft age doesn't have a whole lot to do with

03:51.440 --> 03:54.280
long-haul low-cost airline profitability.

03:54.280 --> 03:57.720
There are reasons why a young fleet could help, like through lower fuel burn, but there

03:57.720 --> 04:02.000
are also reasons why an older fleet could help, like through lower capital cost, so

04:02.000 --> 04:04.520
it seems like it all evens out in the end.

04:04.520 --> 04:09.400
It's a similar case with the average long-haul aircraft capacity, average origin country

04:09.400 --> 04:13.920
GDP per capita, and average origin traffic coefficient of variation—essentially the

04:13.920 --> 04:16.560
degree of seasonality for passenger demand.

04:16.560 --> 04:21.320
Each of these factors showed very little correlation to profitability, and a few others demonstrated

04:21.320 --> 04:26.960
results with higher, but still fairly statistically insignificant correlation, but then the three

04:26.960 --> 04:31.160
characteristics with the highest degree of correlation to airline profitability start

04:31.160 --> 04:34.760
to paint a pretty clear picture.

04:34.760 --> 04:39.920
The third most correlated characteristic is the average number of route competitors.

04:39.920 --> 04:45.200
Essentially, the data show that low-cost long-haul airlines with a smaller number of competitors

04:45.200 --> 04:48.480
on their average long-haul route do better financially.

04:48.480 --> 04:53.420
Then, the second strongest correlated characteristic is the average total weekly frequency of the

04:53.420 --> 04:57.700
given airlines' long-haul routes—meaning how many total weekly flights are flown by

04:57.700 --> 05:00.660
all airlines on each of their long-haul routes.

05:00.660 --> 05:05.020
The less frequent their average route, the better they seem to do financially.

05:05.020 --> 05:11.180
Then, the most strongly correlated characteristic by far is an airline's number of hubs—the

05:11.180 --> 05:14.380
more hubs they have, the better they perform financially.

05:14.380 --> 05:21.320
Now, each of these three factors have to do with one thing—network design.

05:21.320 --> 05:27.000
They have to do with where and when the airlines fly, but not at all with how—these factors

05:27.000 --> 05:32.540
have nothing to do with the cabins, the aircraft, the ground handling, or anything operational.

05:32.540 --> 05:35.800
So, how do you interpret these data?

05:35.800 --> 05:36.800
What do they mean?

05:36.800 --> 05:42.120
Well, essentially, they suggest that only a very particular type of route network works

05:42.120 --> 05:46.940
for long-haul low-cost flying, and that network is essentially the exact opposite of what

05:46.940 --> 05:50.500
AirAsia X, for example, flies.

05:50.500 --> 05:55.140
This is what their long-haul route map looks like, or rather looked like pre-COVID.

05:55.140 --> 05:59.180
They're flying routes like Kuala Lumpur to Tokyo, competing against 44 flights per

05:59.180 --> 06:04.120
week by Malaysia Airlines, Japan Airlines, and ANA, or Kuala Lumpur to Jeddah, competing

06:04.120 --> 06:08.020
against 33 weekly frequencies by Malaysia Airlines and Saudi Arabia.

06:08.020 --> 06:12.580
In fact, only five of their 19 long-haul routes are competition-free.

06:12.580 --> 06:17.060
They also only have one hub, Kuala Lumpur, from which every single one of their flights,

06:17.060 --> 06:21.040
with the sole exception of a route that continues on from Osaka to Honolulu, originates.

06:22.040 --> 06:26.740
Essentially, they're doing everything the data say not to do and, as predicted, they're

06:26.740 --> 06:29.980
losing tons of money while doing it.

06:29.980 --> 06:35.580
From a data perspective, the exact antithesis of AirAsia X is TUI.

06:35.580 --> 06:38.920
This is what their pre-COVID route network looked like.

06:38.920 --> 06:44.780
Now, while AirAsia X flies high-competition, high-frequency routes from a single hub, TUI

06:44.780 --> 06:48.380
flies low-competition, low-frequency routes from many hubs.

06:48.720 --> 06:53.220
Out of more than 60 long-haul routes, only eight of theirs have direct competition, and

06:53.220 --> 06:58.940
only one of those, Amsterdam to Paramaribo, is flown by two competing airlines.

06:58.940 --> 07:03.820
Each of their routes is also extremely low-frequency, with an average of only three non-stop flights

07:03.820 --> 07:10.260
per week, and, most uniquely, they fly these flights from 18 different hubs across Europe.

07:10.260 --> 07:16.480
Now, these statistical differences are manifestations of the true, more fundamental difference between

07:16.480 --> 07:22.480
AirAsia X and TUI, or Norwegian Airlines and Condor, or Wow Air and Azul Airlines.

07:22.480 --> 07:27.800
What's actually different between these airlines and these airlines is how they deal

07:27.800 --> 07:29.320
with demand.

07:29.320 --> 07:34.280
AirAsia X, Norwegian Airlines, and Wow Air try to capture demand.

07:34.280 --> 07:38.400
They're entering some of the busiest airline markets in the world, home to some of the

07:38.400 --> 07:43.120
largest and most powerful airlines out there, and are trying to lure a large enough portion

07:43.120 --> 07:46.200
of the passengers to fill their planes.

07:46.200 --> 07:51.860
The difference is subtle, but TUI, Condor, and Azul Airlines don't as much try to capture

07:51.860 --> 07:55.760
a market, but rather try to create it.

07:55.760 --> 08:01.540
In fact, quite literally, the second line of the Azul Airlines Wikipedia page says exactly

08:01.540 --> 08:06.000
this—the company's business model is to stimulate demand by providing frequent and

08:06.000 --> 08:09.580
affordable air service to underserved markets throughout Brazil.

08:09.580 --> 08:14.320
The reason why LATAM, Brazil's largest airline, doesn't have a flight from Recife to Orlando

08:14.320 --> 08:18.480
is because they have the data and they know that the number of people who connect from

08:18.480 --> 08:23.760
Recife to São Paulo to Orlando on their own flights is not enough to fill a plane non-stop

08:23.760 --> 08:28.680
from Recife to Orlando—at least at their full service prices.

08:28.680 --> 08:33.320
When Azul comes in and drops fares to a couple hundred dollars, some people might choose

08:33.320 --> 08:38.660
to fly on Azul because the price is cheap and they were going there already, but crucially,

08:38.660 --> 08:43.200
others will choose to fly this route because the price is so low.

08:43.200 --> 08:45.480
They're creating demand.

08:45.480 --> 08:51.680
Now, evidence of this phenomena can be found by looking at short-haul, low-cost carriers—the

08:51.680 --> 08:56.720
ones who have been operating for decades profitably and undoubtedly know what they're doing.

08:56.720 --> 09:01.920
You see, the busiest route in Europe, by scheduled seat capacity, is Barcelona to Madrid, and

09:01.920 --> 09:05.000
Europe's largest low-cost airline is Ryanair.

09:05.000 --> 09:08.800
Conspicuously, though, Ryanair does not operate this route.

09:09.160 --> 09:14.240
They also don't operate from Paris to London, or Stockholm to Oslo, or Berlin to Frankfurt,

09:14.240 --> 09:18.300
or countless other of the busiest passenger flows in Europe because they can make more

09:18.300 --> 09:25.160
money by stimulating demand on low-competition, historically low-demand routes.

09:25.160 --> 09:30.240
Across the board, the routes that work for short-haul, low-cost carriers are different

09:30.240 --> 09:33.440
than those that work for full-service airlines.

09:33.440 --> 09:38.680
When long-haul, low-cost airlines emerged en masse, many—including AirAsiaX, Norwegian

09:38.680 --> 09:43.160
Airlines, and Wow Air—seemingly sought to emulate the route maps of their full-service

09:43.160 --> 09:44.160
competitors.

09:44.160 --> 09:48.800
Wow Air, for example, focused on connecting major US cities to major European cities via

09:48.800 --> 09:52.920
Reykjavik, Norwegian did the same but with non-stop flights, while AirAsiaX worked to

09:52.920 --> 09:56.680
complement their short-haul network by connecting Malaysia to the rest of Asia.

09:56.680 --> 10:02.700
The problem is, short-haul budget airlines already proved that this was hardly viable,

10:02.700 --> 10:07.060
and it's even less viable with low-cost long-haul airlines because they have even

10:07.060 --> 10:09.420
less basis for cost differentiation.

10:09.420 --> 10:14.660
That's because, the longer a flight is, the greater proportion of the overall cost

10:14.660 --> 10:19.880
fuel takes up, and that's because, no matter the length of a flight, airlines always only

10:19.880 --> 10:25.060
have to pay for one set of check-in agents, one gate, one cleaning crew, and one of everything

10:25.060 --> 10:29.760
else a flight needs at the airport, but for every minute a flight is airborne, they have

10:29.760 --> 10:31.900
to pay more for fuel.

10:31.900 --> 10:36.440
What TUI, Condor, and Azul airlines have in common is that they look for routes where

10:36.440 --> 10:41.780
people want to travel but choose not to because of the cost or time it takes to get there,

10:41.780 --> 10:44.220
or because they haven't even considered it.

10:44.220 --> 10:48.820
They pretty much ignore business travelers entirely and focus on the two other major

10:48.820 --> 10:53.620
travel segments—people going on vacation, and people visiting friends and families.

10:53.620 --> 10:58.100
It's certainly counterintuitive to think that TUI can turn a profit flying from Brussels

10:58.100 --> 11:02.740
to Banjul in the Gambia, while Norwegian Airlines cannot while flying London to New

11:02.740 --> 11:08.540
York, but this goes to show that what matters in this industry even more than demand is

11:08.540 --> 11:09.680
competition.

11:09.680 --> 11:14.620
There can be all the demand in the world, but if it all goes to a competitor, an airline

11:14.620 --> 11:16.580
will not be viable.

11:16.580 --> 11:21.700
Now, as always, there will certainly be exceptions to this rule, and it isn't to say that there

11:21.700 --> 11:25.940
aren't other factors that influence the profitability of a given long-haul low-cost

11:25.940 --> 11:30.760
airline, but it is to say that the easiest route to profitability seemingly starts with

11:30.760 --> 11:32.720
stimulating demand.

11:32.720 --> 11:38.180
If airlines like Norwegian, AirAsia X, Eurowings, and other unprofitable long-haul low-cost

11:38.180 --> 11:42.980
carriers do make it out to the other end of the COVID-induced air travel downturn, they

11:42.980 --> 11:47.760
will have an opportunity to rebuild their long-haul route networks from nothing, starting

11:47.760 --> 11:50.840
with the ones that have historically worked best.

11:50.840 --> 11:54.700
The data would suggest that the long-haul routes that should work best are ones like

11:54.700 --> 11:59.580
Oslo to Fort Lauderdale or Bangkok—both of which are low-frequency routes with little

11:59.580 --> 12:03.280
competition that also happened to be some of the first long-haul routes they launched

12:03.280 --> 12:05.320
early in the 2010s.

12:05.320 --> 12:09.220
While prior to the pandemic, these airlines were tremendously focused on capturing as

12:09.220 --> 12:13.540
much of the market as possible as fast as possible, which likely led them to launching

12:13.540 --> 12:19.860
unviable routes, the slow yet seemingly imminent restart to international long-haul travel

12:19.860 --> 12:25.080
might act as a natural experiment regarding the viability of the business model.

12:25.080 --> 12:30.660
Without any momentum to work off of, if these airlines—both the profitable and unprofitable

12:30.660 --> 12:35.380
ones—are successfully able to stimulate demand once long-haul travel is once again

12:35.380 --> 12:43.320
safe and possible, that will more or less prove that this is truly their secret sauce.

12:43.320 --> 12:48.220
Following lockdowns in the US, Europe, and Asia, short-haul low-cost carriers outpaced

12:48.220 --> 12:51.340
their full-service competitors in their recoveries.

12:51.340 --> 12:55.900
This was largely because they were able to stimulate demand on leisure routes with cheap

12:55.900 --> 12:59.260
fares and non-stop, point-to-point routes.

12:59.260 --> 13:04.400
The long-haul recovery has barely started yet, but if we see the same happen—if we

13:04.400 --> 13:09.740
see long-haul low-cost carriers lead with niche, low-frequency leisure routes, and if

13:09.740 --> 13:14.260
this works and the recovery outpaces that of full-service airlines, then we'll have

13:14.260 --> 13:19.660
further evidence that what makes low-cost carriers work is not so much their low operating

13:19.660 --> 13:22.540
costs, but rather their route networks.

13:22.540 --> 13:28.760
Then, if this is true, we know that the difference between Lufthansa and Condor Airlines, or

13:28.760 --> 13:34.940
British Airways and TUI, or LATAM and Azul, is that one set of airlines captures demand,

13:34.940 --> 13:38.020
and the other one creates it.

13:38.020 --> 13:42.140
Earlier in this video, I mentioned that I ran regression models on the datasets I created

13:42.140 --> 13:46.180
to research for this video, which might sound like some crazy scary math words to some of

13:46.180 --> 13:50.340
you, and it certainly would if for me a few years ago, but regression analysis is actually

13:50.340 --> 13:53.780
one of the simplest and most powerful tools in statistics.

13:53.780 --> 13:58.540
I'm one of those people who hated math in high school and was terrible at it, but since

13:58.540 --> 14:02.820
then, I've come to love statistics and found my knowledge of the subject quite useful for

14:02.820 --> 14:06.300
both this, my job, and everyday applications.

14:06.300 --> 14:10.380
What really helped me master the subject were brilliant statistics courses.

14:10.420 --> 14:14.540
Specifically, their statistics fundamentals course helped me with regression analysis,

14:14.540 --> 14:18.020
while the rest of the ones on the subject taught me things that I didn't even learn

14:18.020 --> 14:19.820
when I took the course in college.

14:19.820 --> 14:24.120
Now, an online course teaching more than a college course probably sounds scary, but

14:24.120 --> 14:28.900
why Brilliant is so great is that they take these huge, complex subjects and break them

14:28.900 --> 14:33.460
down into little chunks which they teach by explaining the intuitive fundamentals.

14:33.460 --> 14:37.640
In the end, even if you're the opposite of a math expert, like me, you can finally

14:37.640 --> 14:41.400
understand these subjects that you previously looked at in trepidation.
