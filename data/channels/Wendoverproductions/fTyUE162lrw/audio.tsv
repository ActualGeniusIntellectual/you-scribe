2940	10140	Start learning complex STEM subjects simply by going to brilliant.org slash wendover.
10140	12100	The idea is simple.
12100	16720	You take what Southwest, Ryanair, Wizz Air, and countless other low-cost airlines have
16720	20860	done with short-haul flying, and apply it to the long-haul market.
20860	22940	You make long-haul flying cheap.
22940	27640	That's the concept behind low-cost, long-haul airlines.
27640	32640	To make that actually work, however, has proved a little more difficult.
32640	37640	Now, the underlying recipe behind low-cost short-haul airlines by the like of Ryanair
37640	42980	and low-cost long-haul airlines such as Norwegian Airlines looks the same on the surface—one
42980	47920	just flies longer routes than the other—but the result has been markedly different.
47920	53080	Ryanair is one of the most profitable airlines in the world—Norwegian has been operating
53080	56080	deeply in the red for years.
56080	61080	Low-cost short-haul airlines have upended the global aviation industry.
61080	65840	Low-cost long-haul airlines have failed, and failed, and failed again.
65840	72040	In 2019 alone, Wow Air, June, Églazur, Thomas Cook, and XL Airlines all went under, all
72040	74920	after operating under this business model.
74920	78940	In fact, globally, there are only about a dozen airlines currently operating using this
78940	83880	business model after scores more have tried over the decades.
83880	88560	These few survivors, though, are not all failures hanging on to their last fragments
88560	89840	of life.
89840	95840	Over the past five years, before the COVID-induced travel downturn, Condor, Cebu Pacific, Azul
95840	101320	Airlines, Jetstar, TUI, Scoot, and WestJet have each operated long-haul, low-cost flights
101320	104240	at varying levels, but earned a profit.
104240	110480	Meanwhile, though, AirAsia X, Norwegian Airlines, Eurowings, and countless now-bankrupt low-cost
110480	113400	long-haul airlines operated at a loss.
113400	117000	So, considering some can do it, why can't they all?
117000	122560	What's the secret sauce to a profitable, long-haul, low-cost airline?
122560	128720	Well, these are the 14 measurable characteristics that might impact the profitability of a given
128720	130960	long-haul, low-cost airline.
130960	135400	These are ten currently or recently operating long-haul, low-cost airlines that report independent
135400	140320	financial results, and these are each of those 14 characteristics quantified for each of
140320	144720	those ten airlines, based on data before the coronavirus pandemic started.
144720	150160	Now, for most of these characteristics, there's quite a lot of variability from airline to
150160	155200	airline—each company clearly has its own hypothesis for the correct formula that might
155200	158120	make low-cost long-haul travel possible.
158120	162600	For example, in terms of number of hubs, defined as the number of distinct origins their flights
162600	169360	operate from, TUI has 18 spread out across Europe, while AirAsia X has just one, Kuala
169360	170360	Lumpur.
170360	174560	Meanwhile, in the category of the average number of route competitors, defined as how
174560	179200	many other airlines operate the same long-haul routes as the subject airline, TUI had the
179200	183640	least, meaning that for almost all of their routes, they were the only airline to operate
183640	188240	it, while Cebu Pacific had the most, meaning that they typically had multiple competitors
188240	190160	on each of their routes.
190160	194920	Now, by performing regression analysis, the data suggests that most of these characteristics
194920	197720	have very little correlation to profitability.
197720	202080	For example, you might think, like many in the industry, that long-haul low-cost carriers
202080	206160	would benefit from having younger, more fuel-efficient aircraft.
206160	211920	Norwegian Airlines, though, has an average aircraft age of just 2.3 years, but it's
211920	216680	deeply unprofitable, while Condor, on the other hand, has an average aircraft age of
216680	220840	24 years, and yet it's the most profitable airline of these ten.
220840	225360	Of course, then there's Eurowings, with the second oldest fleet, and yet it's also
225360	226680	deeply unprofitable.
226680	231440	Essentially, the data suggest that aircraft age doesn't have a whole lot to do with
231440	234280	long-haul low-cost airline profitability.
234280	237720	There are reasons why a young fleet could help, like through lower fuel burn, but there
237720	242000	are also reasons why an older fleet could help, like through lower capital cost, so
242000	244520	it seems like it all evens out in the end.
244520	249400	It's a similar case with the average long-haul aircraft capacity, average origin country
249400	253920	GDP per capita, and average origin traffic coefficient of variation—essentially the
253920	256560	degree of seasonality for passenger demand.
256560	261320	Each of these factors showed very little correlation to profitability, and a few others demonstrated
261320	266960	results with higher, but still fairly statistically insignificant correlation, but then the three
266960	271160	characteristics with the highest degree of correlation to airline profitability start
271160	274760	to paint a pretty clear picture.
274760	279920	The third most correlated characteristic is the average number of route competitors.
279920	285200	Essentially, the data show that low-cost long-haul airlines with a smaller number of competitors
285200	288480	on their average long-haul route do better financially.
288480	293420	Then, the second strongest correlated characteristic is the average total weekly frequency of the
293420	297700	given airlines' long-haul routes—meaning how many total weekly flights are flown by
297700	300660	all airlines on each of their long-haul routes.
300660	305020	The less frequent their average route, the better they seem to do financially.
305020	311180	Then, the most strongly correlated characteristic by far is an airline's number of hubs—the
311180	314380	more hubs they have, the better they perform financially.
314380	321320	Now, each of these three factors have to do with one thing—network design.
321320	327000	They have to do with where and when the airlines fly, but not at all with how—these factors
327000	332540	have nothing to do with the cabins, the aircraft, the ground handling, or anything operational.
332540	335800	So, how do you interpret these data?
335800	336800	What do they mean?
336800	342120	Well, essentially, they suggest that only a very particular type of route network works
342120	346940	for long-haul low-cost flying, and that network is essentially the exact opposite of what
346940	350500	AirAsia X, for example, flies.
350500	355140	This is what their long-haul route map looks like, or rather looked like pre-COVID.
355140	359180	They're flying routes like Kuala Lumpur to Tokyo, competing against 44 flights per
359180	364120	week by Malaysia Airlines, Japan Airlines, and ANA, or Kuala Lumpur to Jeddah, competing
364120	368020	against 33 weekly frequencies by Malaysia Airlines and Saudi Arabia.
368020	372580	In fact, only five of their 19 long-haul routes are competition-free.
372580	377060	They also only have one hub, Kuala Lumpur, from which every single one of their flights,
377060	381040	with the sole exception of a route that continues on from Osaka to Honolulu, originates.
382040	386740	Essentially, they're doing everything the data say not to do and, as predicted, they're
386740	389980	losing tons of money while doing it.
389980	395580	From a data perspective, the exact antithesis of AirAsia X is TUI.
395580	398920	This is what their pre-COVID route network looked like.
398920	404780	Now, while AirAsia X flies high-competition, high-frequency routes from a single hub, TUI
404780	408380	flies low-competition, low-frequency routes from many hubs.
408720	413220	Out of more than 60 long-haul routes, only eight of theirs have direct competition, and
413220	418940	only one of those, Amsterdam to Paramaribo, is flown by two competing airlines.
418940	423820	Each of their routes is also extremely low-frequency, with an average of only three non-stop flights
423820	430260	per week, and, most uniquely, they fly these flights from 18 different hubs across Europe.
430260	436480	Now, these statistical differences are manifestations of the true, more fundamental difference between
436480	442480	AirAsia X and TUI, or Norwegian Airlines and Condor, or Wow Air and Azul Airlines.
442480	447800	What's actually different between these airlines and these airlines is how they deal
447800	449320	with demand.
449320	454280	AirAsia X, Norwegian Airlines, and Wow Air try to capture demand.
454280	458400	They're entering some of the busiest airline markets in the world, home to some of the
458400	463120	largest and most powerful airlines out there, and are trying to lure a large enough portion
463120	466200	of the passengers to fill their planes.
466200	471860	The difference is subtle, but TUI, Condor, and Azul Airlines don't as much try to capture
471860	475760	a market, but rather try to create it.
475760	481540	In fact, quite literally, the second line of the Azul Airlines Wikipedia page says exactly
481540	486000	this—the company's business model is to stimulate demand by providing frequent and
486000	489580	affordable air service to underserved markets throughout Brazil.
489580	494320	The reason why LATAM, Brazil's largest airline, doesn't have a flight from Recife to Orlando
494320	498480	is because they have the data and they know that the number of people who connect from
498480	503760	Recife to São Paulo to Orlando on their own flights is not enough to fill a plane non-stop
503760	508680	from Recife to Orlando—at least at their full service prices.
508680	513320	When Azul comes in and drops fares to a couple hundred dollars, some people might choose
513320	518660	to fly on Azul because the price is cheap and they were going there already, but crucially,
518660	523200	others will choose to fly this route because the price is so low.
523200	525480	They're creating demand.
525480	531680	Now, evidence of this phenomena can be found by looking at short-haul, low-cost carriers—the
531680	536720	ones who have been operating for decades profitably and undoubtedly know what they're doing.
536720	541920	You see, the busiest route in Europe, by scheduled seat capacity, is Barcelona to Madrid, and
541920	545000	Europe's largest low-cost airline is Ryanair.
545000	548800	Conspicuously, though, Ryanair does not operate this route.
549160	554240	They also don't operate from Paris to London, or Stockholm to Oslo, or Berlin to Frankfurt,
554240	558300	or countless other of the busiest passenger flows in Europe because they can make more
558300	565160	money by stimulating demand on low-competition, historically low-demand routes.
565160	570240	Across the board, the routes that work for short-haul, low-cost carriers are different
570240	573440	than those that work for full-service airlines.
573440	578680	When long-haul, low-cost airlines emerged en masse, many—including AirAsiaX, Norwegian
578680	583160	Airlines, and Wow Air—seemingly sought to emulate the route maps of their full-service
583160	584160	competitors.
584160	588800	Wow Air, for example, focused on connecting major US cities to major European cities via
588800	592920	Reykjavik, Norwegian did the same but with non-stop flights, while AirAsiaX worked to
592920	596680	complement their short-haul network by connecting Malaysia to the rest of Asia.
596680	602700	The problem is, short-haul budget airlines already proved that this was hardly viable,
602700	607060	and it's even less viable with low-cost long-haul airlines because they have even
607060	609420	less basis for cost differentiation.
609420	614660	That's because, the longer a flight is, the greater proportion of the overall cost
614660	619880	fuel takes up, and that's because, no matter the length of a flight, airlines always only
619880	625060	have to pay for one set of check-in agents, one gate, one cleaning crew, and one of everything
625060	629760	else a flight needs at the airport, but for every minute a flight is airborne, they have
629760	631900	to pay more for fuel.
631900	636440	What TUI, Condor, and Azul airlines have in common is that they look for routes where
636440	641780	people want to travel but choose not to because of the cost or time it takes to get there,
641780	644220	or because they haven't even considered it.
644220	648820	They pretty much ignore business travelers entirely and focus on the two other major
648820	653620	travel segments—people going on vacation, and people visiting friends and families.
653620	658100	It's certainly counterintuitive to think that TUI can turn a profit flying from Brussels
658100	662740	to Banjul in the Gambia, while Norwegian Airlines cannot while flying London to New
662740	668540	York, but this goes to show that what matters in this industry even more than demand is
668540	669680	competition.
669680	674620	There can be all the demand in the world, but if it all goes to a competitor, an airline
674620	676580	will not be viable.
676580	681700	Now, as always, there will certainly be exceptions to this rule, and it isn't to say that there
681700	685940	aren't other factors that influence the profitability of a given long-haul low-cost
685940	690760	airline, but it is to say that the easiest route to profitability seemingly starts with
690760	692720	stimulating demand.
692720	698180	If airlines like Norwegian, AirAsia X, Eurowings, and other unprofitable long-haul low-cost
698180	702980	carriers do make it out to the other end of the COVID-induced air travel downturn, they
702980	707760	will have an opportunity to rebuild their long-haul route networks from nothing, starting
707760	710840	with the ones that have historically worked best.
710840	714700	The data would suggest that the long-haul routes that should work best are ones like
714700	719580	Oslo to Fort Lauderdale or Bangkok—both of which are low-frequency routes with little
719580	723280	competition that also happened to be some of the first long-haul routes they launched
723280	725320	early in the 2010s.
725320	729220	While prior to the pandemic, these airlines were tremendously focused on capturing as
729220	733540	much of the market as possible as fast as possible, which likely led them to launching
733540	739860	unviable routes, the slow yet seemingly imminent restart to international long-haul travel
739860	745080	might act as a natural experiment regarding the viability of the business model.
745080	750660	Without any momentum to work off of, if these airlines—both the profitable and unprofitable
750660	755380	ones—are successfully able to stimulate demand once long-haul travel is once again
755380	763320	safe and possible, that will more or less prove that this is truly their secret sauce.
763320	768220	Following lockdowns in the US, Europe, and Asia, short-haul low-cost carriers outpaced
768220	771340	their full-service competitors in their recoveries.
771340	775900	This was largely because they were able to stimulate demand on leisure routes with cheap
775900	779260	fares and non-stop, point-to-point routes.
779260	784400	The long-haul recovery has barely started yet, but if we see the same happen—if we
784400	789740	see long-haul low-cost carriers lead with niche, low-frequency leisure routes, and if
789740	794260	this works and the recovery outpaces that of full-service airlines, then we'll have
794260	799660	further evidence that what makes low-cost carriers work is not so much their low operating
799660	802540	costs, but rather their route networks.
802540	808760	Then, if this is true, we know that the difference between Lufthansa and Condor Airlines, or
808760	814940	British Airways and TUI, or LATAM and Azul, is that one set of airlines captures demand,
814940	818020	and the other one creates it.
818020	822140	Earlier in this video, I mentioned that I ran regression models on the datasets I created
822140	826180	to research for this video, which might sound like some crazy scary math words to some of
826180	830340	you, and it certainly would if for me a few years ago, but regression analysis is actually
830340	833780	one of the simplest and most powerful tools in statistics.
833780	838540	I'm one of those people who hated math in high school and was terrible at it, but since
838540	842820	then, I've come to love statistics and found my knowledge of the subject quite useful for
842820	846300	both this, my job, and everyday applications.
846300	850380	What really helped me master the subject were brilliant statistics courses.
850420	854540	Specifically, their statistics fundamentals course helped me with regression analysis,
854540	858020	while the rest of the ones on the subject taught me things that I didn't even learn
858020	859820	when I took the course in college.
859820	864120	Now, an online course teaching more than a college course probably sounds scary, but
864120	868900	why Brilliant is so great is that they take these huge, complex subjects and break them
868900	873460	down into little chunks which they teach by explaining the intuitive fundamentals.
873460	877640	In the end, even if you're the opposite of a math expert, like me, you can finally
877640	881400	understand these subjects that you previously looked at in trepidation.
881400	885680	All in all, if you want to learn the subjects you hated in school, but actually enjoy the
885680	888920	process, Brilliant is the place for you.
