3
00:00:10,140 --> 00:00:12,100
The idea is simple.

4
00:00:12,100 --> 00:00:16,720
You take what Southwest, Ryanair, Wizz Air, and countless other low-cost airlines have

5
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:20,860
done with short-haul flying, and apply it to the long-haul market.

6
00:00:20,860 --> 00:00:22,940
You make long-haul flying cheap.

7
00:00:22,940 --> 00:00:27,640
That's the concept behind low-cost, long-haul airlines.

8
00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:32,640
To make that actually work, however, has proved a little more difficult.

9
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:37,640
Now, the underlying recipe behind low-cost short-haul airlines by the like of Ryanair

10
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:42,980
and low-cost long-haul airlines such as Norwegian Airlines looks the same on the surface—one

11
00:00:42,980 --> 00:00:47,920
just flies longer routes than the other—but the result has been markedly different.

12
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:53,080
Ryanair is one of the most profitable airlines in the world—Norwegian has been operating

13
00:00:53,080 --> 00:00:56,080
deeply in the red for years.

14
00:00:56,080 --> 00:01:01,080
Low-cost short-haul airlines have upended the global aviation industry.

15
00:01:01,080 --> 00:01:05,840
Low-cost long-haul airlines have failed, and failed, and failed again.

16
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:12,040
In 2019 alone, Wow Air, June, Églazur, Thomas Cook, and XL Airlines all went under, all

17
00:01:12,040 --> 00:01:14,920
after operating under this business model.

18
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:18,940
In fact, globally, there are only about a dozen airlines currently operating using this

19
00:01:18,940 --> 00:01:23,880
business model after scores more have tried over the decades.

20
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:28,560
These few survivors, though, are not all failures hanging on to their last fragments

21
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:29,840
of life.

22
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:35,840
Over the past five years, before the COVID-induced travel downturn, Condor, Cebu Pacific, Azul

23
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:41,320
Airlines, Jetstar, TUI, Scoot, and WestJet have each operated long-haul, low-cost flights

24
00:01:41,320 --> 00:01:44,240
at varying levels, but earned a profit.

25
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:50,480
Meanwhile, though, AirAsia X, Norwegian Airlines, Eurowings, and countless now-bankrupt low-cost

26
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:53,400
long-haul airlines operated at a loss.

27
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:57,000
So, considering some can do it, why can't they all?

28
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:02,560
What's the secret sauce to a profitable, long-haul, low-cost airline?

29
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:08,720
Well, these are the 14 measurable characteristics that might impact the profitability of a given

30
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:10,960
long-haul, low-cost airline.

31
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:15,400
These are ten currently or recently operating long-haul, low-cost airlines that report independent

32
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:20,320
financial results, and these are each of those 14 characteristics quantified for each of

33
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:24,720
those ten airlines, based on data before the coronavirus pandemic started.

34
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:30,160
Now, for most of these characteristics, there's quite a lot of variability from airline to

35
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:35,200
airline—each company clearly has its own hypothesis for the correct formula that might

36
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:38,120
make low-cost long-haul travel possible.

37
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:42,600
For example, in terms of number of hubs, defined as the number of distinct origins their flights

38
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:49,360
operate from, TUI has 18 spread out across Europe, while AirAsia X has just one, Kuala

39
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:50,360
Lumpur.

40
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:54,560
Meanwhile, in the category of the average number of route competitors, defined as how

41
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:59,200
many other airlines operate the same long-haul routes as the subject airline, TUI had the

42
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:03,640
least, meaning that for almost all of their routes, they were the only airline to operate

43
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:08,240
it, while Cebu Pacific had the most, meaning that they typically had multiple competitors

44
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:10,160
on each of their routes.

45
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:14,920
Now, by performing regression analysis, the data suggests that most of these characteristics

46
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:17,720
have very little correlation to profitability.

47
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:22,080
For example, you might think, like many in the industry, that long-haul low-cost carriers

48
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:26,160
would benefit from having younger, more fuel-efficient aircraft.

49
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:31,920
Norwegian Airlines, though, has an average aircraft age of just 2.3 years, but it's

50
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:36,680
deeply unprofitable, while Condor, on the other hand, has an average aircraft age of

51
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:40,840
24 years, and yet it's the most profitable airline of these ten.

52
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:45,360
Of course, then there's Eurowings, with the second oldest fleet, and yet it's also

53
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:46,680
deeply unprofitable.

54
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:51,440
Essentially, the data suggest that aircraft age doesn't have a whole lot to do with

55
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:54,280
long-haul low-cost airline profitability.

56
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:57,720
There are reasons why a young fleet could help, like through lower fuel burn, but there

57
00:03:57,720 --> 00:04:02,000
are also reasons why an older fleet could help, like through lower capital cost, so

58
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,520
it seems like it all evens out in the end.

59
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:09,400
It's a similar case with the average long-haul aircraft capacity, average origin country

60
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:13,920
GDP per capita, and average origin traffic coefficient of variation—essentially the

61
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:16,560
degree of seasonality for passenger demand.

62
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:21,320
Each of these factors showed very little correlation to profitability, and a few others demonstrated

63
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:26,960
results with higher, but still fairly statistically insignificant correlation, but then the three

64
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:31,160
characteristics with the highest degree of correlation to airline profitability start

65
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:34,760
to paint a pretty clear picture.

66
00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:39,920
The third most correlated characteristic is the average number of route competitors.

67
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:45,200
Essentially, the data show that low-cost long-haul airlines with a smaller number of competitors

68
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:48,480
on their average long-haul route do better financially.

69
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:53,420
Then, the second strongest correlated characteristic is the average total weekly frequency of the

70
00:04:53,420 --> 00:04:57,700
given airlines' long-haul routes—meaning how many total weekly flights are flown by

71
00:04:57,700 --> 00:05:00,660
all airlines on each of their long-haul routes.

72
00:05:00,660 --> 00:05:05,020
The less frequent their average route, the better they seem to do financially.

73
00:05:05,020 --> 00:05:11,180
Then, the most strongly correlated characteristic by far is an airline's number of hubs—the

74
00:05:11,180 --> 00:05:14,380
more hubs they have, the better they perform financially.

75
00:05:14,380 --> 00:05:21,320
Now, each of these three factors have to do with one thing—network design.

76
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:27,000
They have to do with where and when the airlines fly, but not at all with how—these factors

77
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:32,540
have nothing to do with the cabins, the aircraft, the ground handling, or anything operational.

78
00:05:32,540 --> 00:05:35,800
So, how do you interpret these data?

79
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:36,800
What do they mean?

80
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:42,120
Well, essentially, they suggest that only a very particular type of route network works

81
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:46,940
for long-haul low-cost flying, and that network is essentially the exact opposite of what

82
00:05:46,940 --> 00:05:50,500
AirAsia X, for example, flies.

83
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:55,140
This is what their long-haul route map looks like, or rather looked like pre-COVID.

84
00:05:55,140 --> 00:05:59,180
They're flying routes like Kuala Lumpur to Tokyo, competing against 44 flights per

85
00:05:59,180 --> 00:06:04,120
week by Malaysia Airlines, Japan Airlines, and ANA, or Kuala Lumpur to Jeddah, competing

86
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:08,020
against 33 weekly frequencies by Malaysia Airlines and Saudi Arabia.

87
00:06:08,020 --> 00:06:12,580
In fact, only five of their 19 long-haul routes are competition-free.

88
00:06:12,580 --> 00:06:17,060
They also only have one hub, Kuala Lumpur, from which every single one of their flights,

89
00:06:17,060 --> 00:06:21,040
with the sole exception of a route that continues on from Osaka to Honolulu, originates.

90
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:26,740
Essentially, they're doing everything the data say not to do and, as predicted, they're

91
00:06:26,740 --> 00:06:29,980
losing tons of money while doing it.

92
00:06:29,980 --> 00:06:35,580
From a data perspective, the exact antithesis of AirAsia X is TUI.

93
00:06:35,580 --> 00:06:38,920
This is what their pre-COVID route network looked like.

94
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:44,780
Now, while AirAsia X flies high-competition, high-frequency routes from a single hub, TUI

95
00:06:44,780 --> 00:06:48,380
flies low-competition, low-frequency routes from many hubs.

96
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:53,220
Out of more than 60 long-haul routes, only eight of theirs have direct competition, and

97
00:06:53,220 --> 00:06:58,940
only one of those, Amsterdam to Paramaribo, is flown by two competing airlines.

98
00:06:58,940 --> 00:07:03,820
Each of their routes is also extremely low-frequency, with an average of only three non-stop flights

99
00:07:03,820 --> 00:07:10,260
per week, and, most uniquely, they fly these flights from 18 different hubs across Europe.

100
00:07:10,260 --> 00:07:16,480
Now, these statistical differences are manifestations of the true, more fundamental difference between

101
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:22,480
AirAsia X and TUI, or Norwegian Airlines and Condor, or Wow Air and Azul Airlines.

102
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:27,800
What's actually different between these airlines and these airlines is how they deal

103
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:29,320
with demand.

104
00:07:29,320 --> 00:07:34,280
AirAsia X, Norwegian Airlines, and Wow Air try to capture demand.

105
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:38,400
They're entering some of the busiest airline markets in the world, home to some of the

106
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:43,120
largest and most powerful airlines out there, and are trying to lure a large enough portion

107
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:46,200
of the passengers to fill their planes.

108
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:51,860
The difference is subtle, but TUI, Condor, and Azul Airlines don't as much try to capture

109
00:07:51,860 --> 00:07:55,760
a market, but rather try to create it.

110
00:07:55,760 --> 00:08:01,540
In fact, quite literally, the second line of the Azul Airlines Wikipedia page says exactly

111
00:08:01,540 --> 00:08:06,000
this—the company's business model is to stimulate demand by providing frequent and

112
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:09,580
affordable air service to underserved markets throughout Brazil.

113
00:08:09,580 --> 00:08:14,320
The reason why LATAM, Brazil's largest airline, doesn't have a flight from Recife to Orlando

114
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:18,480
is because they have the data and they know that the number of people who connect from

115
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:23,760
Recife to São Paulo to Orlando on their own flights is not enough to fill a plane non-stop

116
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:28,680
from Recife to Orlando—at least at their full service prices.

117
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:33,320
When Azul comes in and drops fares to a couple hundred dollars, some people might choose

118
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:38,660
to fly on Azul because the price is cheap and they were going there already, but crucially,

119
00:08:38,660 --> 00:08:43,200
others will choose to fly this route because the price is so low.

120
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:45,480
They're creating demand.

121
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:51,680
Now, evidence of this phenomena can be found by looking at short-haul, low-cost carriers—the

122
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:56,720
ones who have been operating for decades profitably and undoubtedly know what they're doing.

123
00:08:56,720 --> 00:09:01,920
You see, the busiest route in Europe, by scheduled seat capacity, is Barcelona to Madrid, and

124
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:05,000
Europe's largest low-cost airline is Ryanair.

125
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:08,800
Conspicuously, though, Ryanair does not operate this route.

126
00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:14,240
They also don't operate from Paris to London, or Stockholm to Oslo, or Berlin to Frankfurt,

127
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:18,300
or countless other of the busiest passenger flows in Europe because they can make more

128
00:09:18,300 --> 00:09:25,160
money by stimulating demand on low-competition, historically low-demand routes.

129
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:30,240
Across the board, the routes that work for short-haul, low-cost carriers are different

130
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:33,440
than those that work for full-service airlines.

131
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:38,680
When long-haul, low-cost airlines emerged en masse, many—including AirAsiaX, Norwegian

132
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:43,160
Airlines, and Wow Air—seemingly sought to emulate the route maps of their full-service

133
00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:44,160
competitors.

134
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:48,800
Wow Air, for example, focused on connecting major US cities to major European cities via

135
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:52,920
Reykjavik, Norwegian did the same but with non-stop flights, while AirAsiaX worked to

136
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:56,680
complement their short-haul network by connecting Malaysia to the rest of Asia.

137
00:09:56,680 --> 00:10:02,700
The problem is, short-haul budget airlines already proved that this was hardly viable,

138
00:10:02,700 --> 00:10:07,060
and it's even less viable with low-cost long-haul airlines because they have even

139
00:10:07,060 --> 00:10:09,420
less basis for cost differentiation.

140
00:10:09,420 --> 00:10:14,660
That's because, the longer a flight is, the greater proportion of the overall cost

141
00:10:14,660 --> 00:10:19,880
fuel takes up, and that's because, no matter the length of a flight, airlines always only

142
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:25,060
have to pay for one set of check-in agents, one gate, one cleaning crew, and one of everything

143
00:10:25,060 --> 00:10:29,760
else a flight needs at the airport, but for every minute a flight is airborne, they have

144
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:31,900
to pay more for fuel.

145
00:10:31,900 --> 00:10:36,440
What TUI, Condor, and Azul airlines have in common is that they look for routes where

146
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:41,780
people want to travel but choose not to because of the cost or time it takes to get there,

147
00:10:41,780 --> 00:10:44,220
or because they haven't even considered it.

148
00:10:44,220 --> 00:10:48,820
They pretty much ignore business travelers entirely and focus on the two other major

149
00:10:48,820 --> 00:10:53,620
travel segments—people going on vacation, and people visiting friends and families.

150
00:10:53,620 --> 00:10:58,100
It's certainly counterintuitive to think that TUI can turn a profit flying from Brussels

151
00:10:58,100 --> 00:11:02,740
to Banjul in the Gambia, while Norwegian Airlines cannot while flying London to New

152
00:11:02,740 --> 00:11:08,540
York, but this goes to show that what matters in this industry even more than demand is

153
00:11:08,540 --> 00:11:09,680
competition.

154
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:14,620
There can be all the demand in the world, but if it all goes to a competitor, an airline

155
00:11:14,620 --> 00:11:16,580
will not be viable.

156
00:11:16,580 --> 00:11:21,700
Now, as always, there will certainly be exceptions to this rule, and it isn't to say that there

157
00:11:21,700 --> 00:11:25,940
aren't other factors that influence the profitability of a given long-haul low-cost

158
00:11:25,940 --> 00:11:30,760
airline, but it is to say that the easiest route to profitability seemingly starts with

159
00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:32,720
stimulating demand.

160
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:38,180
If airlines like Norwegian, AirAsia X, Eurowings, and other unprofitable long-haul low-cost

161
00:11:38,180 --> 00:11:42,980
carriers do make it out to the other end of the COVID-induced air travel downturn, they

162
00:11:42,980 --> 00:11:47,760
will have an opportunity to rebuild their long-haul route networks from nothing, starting

163
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:50,840
with the ones that have historically worked best.

164
00:11:50,840 --> 00:11:54,700
The data would suggest that the long-haul routes that should work best are ones like

165
00:11:54,700 --> 00:11:59,580
Oslo to Fort Lauderdale or Bangkok—both of which are low-frequency routes with little

166
00:11:59,580 --> 00:12:03,280
competition that also happened to be some of the first long-haul routes they launched

167
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:05,320
early in the 2010s.

168
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:09,220
While prior to the pandemic, these airlines were tremendously focused on capturing as

169
00:12:09,220 --> 00:12:13,540
much of the market as possible as fast as possible, which likely led them to launching

170
00:12:13,540 --> 00:12:19,860
unviable routes, the slow yet seemingly imminent restart to international long-haul travel

171
00:12:19,860 --> 00:12:25,080
might act as a natural experiment regarding the viability of the business model.

172
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:30,660
Without any momentum to work off of, if these airlines—both the profitable and unprofitable

173
00:12:30,660 --> 00:12:35,380
ones—are successfully able to stimulate demand once long-haul travel is once again

174
00:12:35,380 --> 00:12:43,320
safe and possible, that will more or less prove that this is truly their secret sauce.

175
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:48,220
Following lockdowns in the US, Europe, and Asia, short-haul low-cost carriers outpaced

176
00:12:48,220 --> 00:12:51,340
their full-service competitors in their recoveries.

177
00:12:51,340 --> 00:12:55,900
This was largely because they were able to stimulate demand on leisure routes with cheap

178
00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:59,260
fares and non-stop, point-to-point routes.

179
00:12:59,260 --> 00:13:04,400
The long-haul recovery has barely started yet, but if we see the same happen—if we

180
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:09,740
see long-haul low-cost carriers lead with niche, low-frequency leisure routes, and if

181
00:13:09,740 --> 00:13:14,260
this works and the recovery outpaces that of full-service airlines, then we'll have

182
00:13:14,260 --> 00:13:19,660
further evidence that what makes low-cost carriers work is not so much their low operating

183
00:13:19,660 --> 00:13:22,540
costs, but rather their route networks.

184
00:13:22,540 --> 00:13:28,760
Then, if this is true, we know that the difference between Lufthansa and Condor Airlines, or

185
00:13:28,760 --> 00:13:34,940
British Airways and TUI, or LATAM and Azul, is that one set of airlines captures demand,

186
00:13:34,940 --> 00:13:38,020
and the other one creates it.

187
00:13:38,020 --> 00:13:42,140
Earlier in this video, I mentioned that I ran regression models on the datasets I created

188
00:13:42,140 --> 00:13:46,180
to research for this video, which might sound like some crazy scary math words to some of

189
00:13:46,180 --> 00:13:50,340
you, and it certainly would if for me a few years ago, but regression analysis is actually

190
00:13:50,340 --> 00:13:53,780
one of the simplest and most powerful tools in statistics.

191
00:13:53,780 --> 00:13:58,540
I'm one of those people who hated math in high school and was terrible at it, but since

192
00:13:58,540 --> 00:14:02,820
then, I've come to love statistics and found my knowledge of the subject quite useful for

193
00:14:02,820 --> 00:14:06,300
both this, my job, and everyday applications.

194
00:14:06,300 --> 00:14:10,380
What really helped me master the subject were brilliant statistics courses.

195
00:14:10,420 --> 00:14:14,540
Specifically, their statistics fundamentals course helped me with regression analysis,

196
00:14:14,540 --> 00:14:18,020
while the rest of the ones on the subject taught me things that I didn't even learn

197
00:14:18,020 --> 00:14:19,820
when I took the course in college.

198
00:14:19,820 --> 00:14:24,120
Now, an online course teaching more than a college course probably sounds scary, but

199
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:28,900
why Brilliant is so great is that they take these huge, complex subjects and break them

200
00:14:28,900 --> 00:14:33,460
down into little chunks which they teach by explaining the intuitive fundamentals.

201
00:14:33,460 --> 00:14:37,640
In the end, even if you're the opposite of a math expert, like me, you can finally

202
00:14:37,640 --> 00:14:41,400
understand these subjects that you previously looked at in trepidation.

203
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:45,680
All in all, if you want to learn the subjects you hated in school, but actually enjoy the

204
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:48,920
process, Brilliant is the place for you.
