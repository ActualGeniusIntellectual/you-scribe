{"text": " This video was made possible by Brilliant. Start learning complex STEM subjects simply by going to brilliant.org slash wendover. The idea is simple. You take what Southwest, Ryanair, Wizz Air, and countless other low-cost airlines have done with short-haul flying, and apply it to the long-haul market. You make long-haul flying cheap. That's the concept behind low-cost, long-haul airlines. To make that actually work, however, has proved a little more difficult. Now, the underlying recipe behind low-cost short-haul airlines by the like of Ryanair and low-cost long-haul airlines such as Norwegian Airlines looks the same on the surface\u2014one just flies longer routes than the other\u2014but the result has been markedly different. Ryanair is one of the most profitable airlines in the world\u2014Norwegian has been operating deeply in the red for years. Low-cost short-haul airlines have upended the global aviation industry. Low-cost long-haul airlines have failed, and failed, and failed again. In 2019 alone, Wow Air, June, \u00c9glazur, Thomas Cook, and XL Airlines all went under, all after operating under this business model. In fact, globally, there are only about a dozen airlines currently operating using this business model after scores more have tried over the decades. These few survivors, though, are not all failures hanging on to their last fragments of life. Over the past five years, before the COVID-induced travel downturn, Condor, Cebu Pacific, Azul Airlines, Jetstar, TUI, Scoot, and WestJet have each operated long-haul, low-cost flights at varying levels, but earned a profit. Meanwhile, though, AirAsia X, Norwegian Airlines, Eurowings, and countless now-bankrupt low-cost long-haul airlines operated at a loss. So, considering some can do it, why can't they all? What's the secret sauce to a profitable, long-haul, low-cost airline? Well, these are the 14 measurable characteristics that might impact the profitability of a given long-haul, low-cost airline. These are ten currently or recently operating long-haul, low-cost airlines that report independent financial results, and these are each of those 14 characteristics quantified for each of those ten airlines, based on data before the coronavirus pandemic started. Now, for most of these characteristics, there's quite a lot of variability from airline to airline\u2014each company clearly has its own hypothesis for the correct formula that might make low-cost long-haul travel possible. For example, in terms of number of hubs, defined as the number of distinct origins their flights operate from, TUI has 18 spread out across Europe, while AirAsia X has just one, Kuala Lumpur. Meanwhile, in the category of the average number of route competitors, defined as how many other airlines operate the same long-haul routes as the subject airline, TUI had the least, meaning that for almost all of their routes, they were the only airline to operate it, while Cebu Pacific had the most, meaning that they typically had multiple competitors on each of their routes. Now, by performing regression analysis, the data suggests that most of these characteristics have very little correlation to profitability. For example, you might think, like many in the industry, that long-haul low-cost carriers would benefit from having younger, more fuel-efficient aircraft. Norwegian Airlines, though, has an average aircraft age of just 2.3 years, but it's deeply unprofitable, while Condor, on the other hand, has an average aircraft age of 24 years, and yet it's the most profitable airline of these ten. Of course, then there's Eurowings, with the second oldest fleet, and yet it's also deeply unprofitable. Essentially, the data suggest that aircraft age doesn't have a whole lot to do with long-haul low-cost airline profitability. There are reasons why a young fleet could help, like through lower fuel burn, but there are also reasons why an older fleet could help, like through lower capital cost, so it seems like it all evens out in the end. It's a similar case with the average long-haul aircraft capacity, average origin country GDP per capita, and average origin traffic coefficient of variation\u2014essentially the degree of seasonality for passenger demand. Each of these factors showed very little correlation to profitability, and a few others demonstrated results with higher, but still fairly statistically insignificant correlation, but then the three characteristics with the highest degree of correlation to airline profitability start to paint a pretty clear picture. The third most correlated characteristic is the average number of route competitors. Essentially, the data show that low-cost long-haul airlines with a smaller number of competitors on their average long-haul route do better financially. Then, the second strongest correlated characteristic is the average total weekly frequency of the given airlines' long-haul routes\u2014meaning how many total weekly flights are flown by all airlines on each of their long-haul routes. The less frequent their average route, the better they seem to do financially. Then, the most strongly correlated characteristic by far is an airline's number of hubs\u2014the more hubs they have, the better they perform financially. Now, each of these three factors have to do with one thing\u2014network design. They have to do with where and when the airlines fly, but not at all with how\u2014these factors have nothing to do with the cabins, the aircraft, the ground handling, or anything operational. So, how do you interpret these data? What do they mean? Well, essentially, they suggest that only a very particular type of route network works for long-haul low-cost flying, and that network is essentially the exact opposite of what AirAsia X, for example, flies. This is what their long-haul route map looks like, or rather looked like pre-COVID. They're flying routes like Kuala Lumpur to Tokyo, competing against 44 flights per week by Malaysia Airlines, Japan Airlines, and ANA, or Kuala Lumpur to Jeddah, competing against 33 weekly frequencies by Malaysia Airlines and Saudi Arabia. In fact, only five of their 19 long-haul routes are competition-free. They also only have one hub, Kuala Lumpur, from which every single one of their flights, with the sole exception of a route that continues on from Osaka to Honolulu, originates. Essentially, they're doing everything the data say not to do and, as predicted, they're losing tons of money while doing it. From a data perspective, the exact antithesis of AirAsia X is TUI. This is what their pre-COVID route network looked like. Now, while AirAsia X flies high-competition, high-frequency routes from a single hub, TUI flies low-competition, low-frequency routes from many hubs. Out of more than 60 long-haul routes, only eight of theirs have direct competition, and only one of those, Amsterdam to Paramaribo, is flown by two competing airlines. Each of their routes is also extremely low-frequency, with an average of only three non-stop flights per week, and, most uniquely, they fly these flights from 18 different hubs across Europe. Now, these statistical differences are manifestations of the true, more fundamental difference between AirAsia X and TUI, or Norwegian Airlines and Condor, or Wow Air and Azul Airlines. What's actually different between these airlines and these airlines is how they deal with demand. AirAsia X, Norwegian Airlines, and Wow Air try to capture demand. They're entering some of the busiest airline markets in the world, home to some of the largest and most powerful airlines out there, and are trying to lure a large enough portion of the passengers to fill their planes. The difference is subtle, but TUI, Condor, and Azul Airlines don't as much try to capture a market, but rather try to create it. In fact, quite literally, the second line of the Azul Airlines Wikipedia page says exactly this\u2014the company's business model is to stimulate demand by providing frequent and affordable air service to underserved markets throughout Brazil. The reason why LATAM, Brazil's largest airline, doesn't have a flight from Recife to Orlando is because they have the data and they know that the number of people who connect from Recife to S\u00e3o Paulo to Orlando on their own flights is not enough to fill a plane non-stop from Recife to Orlando\u2014at least at their full service prices. When Azul comes in and drops fares to a couple hundred dollars, some people might choose to fly on Azul because the price is cheap and they were going there already, but crucially, others will choose to fly this route because the price is so low. They're creating demand. Now, evidence of this phenomena can be found by looking at short-haul, low-cost carriers\u2014the ones who have been operating for decades profitably and undoubtedly know what they're doing. You see, the busiest route in Europe, by scheduled seat capacity, is Barcelona to Madrid, and Europe's largest low-cost airline is Ryanair. Conspicuously, though, Ryanair does not operate this route. They also don't operate from Paris to London, or Stockholm to Oslo, or Berlin to Frankfurt, or countless other of the busiest passenger flows in Europe because they can make more money by stimulating demand on low-competition, historically low-demand routes. Across the board, the routes that work for short-haul, low-cost carriers are different than those that work for full-service airlines. When long-haul, low-cost airlines emerged en masse, many\u2014including AirAsiaX, Norwegian Airlines, and Wow Air\u2014seemingly sought to emulate the route maps of their full-service competitors. Wow Air, for example, focused on connecting major US cities to major European cities via Reykjavik, Norwegian did the same but with non-stop flights, while AirAsiaX worked to complement their short-haul network by connecting Malaysia to the rest of Asia. The problem is, short-haul budget airlines already proved that this was hardly viable, and it's even less viable with low-cost long-haul airlines because they have even less basis for cost differentiation. That's because, the longer a flight is, the greater proportion of the overall cost fuel takes up, and that's because, no matter the length of a flight, airlines always only have to pay for one set of check-in agents, one gate, one cleaning crew, and one of everything else a flight needs at the airport, but for every minute a flight is airborne, they have to pay more for fuel. What TUI, Condor, and Azul airlines have in common is that they look for routes where people want to travel but choose not to because of the cost or time it takes to get there, or because they haven't even considered it. They pretty much ignore business travelers entirely and focus on the two other major travel segments\u2014people going on vacation, and people visiting friends and families. It's certainly counterintuitive to think that TUI can turn a profit flying from Brussels to Banjul in the Gambia, while Norwegian Airlines cannot while flying London to New York, but this goes to show that what matters in this industry even more than demand is competition. There can be all the demand in the world, but if it all goes to a competitor, an airline will not be viable. Now, as always, there will certainly be exceptions to this rule, and it isn't to say that there aren't other factors that influence the profitability of a given long-haul low-cost airline, but it is to say that the easiest route to profitability seemingly starts with stimulating demand. If airlines like Norwegian, AirAsia X, Eurowings, and other unprofitable long-haul low-cost carriers do make it out to the other end of the COVID-induced air travel downturn, they will have an opportunity to rebuild their long-haul route networks from nothing, starting with the ones that have historically worked best. The data would suggest that the long-haul routes that should work best are ones like Oslo to Fort Lauderdale or Bangkok\u2014both of which are low-frequency routes with little competition that also happened to be some of the first long-haul routes they launched early in the 2010s. While prior to the pandemic, these airlines were tremendously focused on capturing as much of the market as possible as fast as possible, which likely led them to launching unviable routes, the slow yet seemingly imminent restart to international long-haul travel might act as a natural experiment regarding the viability of the business model. Without any momentum to work off of, if these airlines\u2014both the profitable and unprofitable ones\u2014are successfully able to stimulate demand once long-haul travel is once again safe and possible, that will more or less prove that this is truly their secret sauce. Following lockdowns in the US, Europe, and Asia, short-haul low-cost carriers outpaced their full-service competitors in their recoveries. This was largely because they were able to stimulate demand on leisure routes with cheap fares and non-stop, point-to-point routes. The long-haul recovery has barely started yet, but if we see the same happen\u2014if we see long-haul low-cost carriers lead with niche, low-frequency leisure routes, and if this works and the recovery outpaces that of full-service airlines, then we'll have further evidence that what makes low-cost carriers work is not so much their low operating costs, but rather their route networks. Then, if this is true, we know that the difference between Lufthansa and Condor Airlines, or British Airways and TUI, or LATAM and Azul, is that one set of airlines captures demand, and the other one creates it. Earlier in this video, I mentioned that I ran regression models on the datasets I created to research for this video, which might sound like some crazy scary math words to some of you, and it certainly would if for me a few years ago, but regression analysis is actually one of the simplest and most powerful tools in statistics. I'm one of those people who hated math in high school and was terrible at it, but since then, I've come to love statistics and found my knowledge of the subject quite useful for both this, my job, and everyday applications. What really helped me master the subject were brilliant statistics courses. Specifically, their statistics fundamentals course helped me with regression analysis, while the rest of the ones on the subject taught me things that I didn't even learn when I took the course in college. Now, an online course teaching more than a college course probably sounds scary, but why Brilliant is so great is that they take these huge, complex subjects and break them down into little chunks which they teach by explaining the intuitive fundamentals. In the end, even if you're the opposite of a math expert, like me, you can finally understand these subjects that you previously looked at in trepidation. All in all, if you want to learn the subjects you hated in school, but actually enjoy the process, Brilliant is the place for you.
