3
00:00:09,260 --> 00:00:18,680
About one year ago, in mid-March 2019, Boeing's 737 MAX was quickly and unceremoniously grounded.

4
00:00:18,680 --> 00:00:22,620
This was hugely significant in quite a few different ways.

5
00:00:22,620 --> 00:00:27,460
For Boeing, the MAX was the newest generation of their most popular aircraft series and

6
00:00:27,460 --> 00:00:32,380
its difficulties place a huge stain on the company's stellar safety and reliability

7
00:00:32,380 --> 00:00:33,380
record.

8
00:00:33,380 --> 00:00:37,620
Meanwhile, for the US, it halts growth at one of the country's largest companies and

9
00:00:37,620 --> 00:00:44,340
employers, and then beyond that, for the worldwide aviation industry, it puts 387 aircraft on

10
00:00:44,340 --> 00:00:49,760
the ground at a time of continued growth for most every airline worldwide.

11
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:55,340
Everyone knows why the 737 MAX was grounded by now—faulty sensors would, in particular

12
00:00:55,340 --> 00:00:59,860
circumstances, indicate incorrect information to software which would respond by sending

13
00:00:59,860 --> 00:01:01,660
the aircraft into a nosedive.

14
00:01:01,660 --> 00:01:06,780
What's less known is how Boeing will get the 737 MAX flying again.

15
00:01:06,780 --> 00:01:11,800
In addition to the 387 aircraft that were flying prior to the grounding, Boeing kept

16
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:16,860
production going for nine months after this so there are about another 400 completely

17
00:01:16,860 --> 00:01:22,780
assembled aircraft sitting on every empty piece of tarmac outside Boeing's factory.

18
00:01:22,780 --> 00:01:25,580
Aircraft are not built to sit around.

19
00:01:25,580 --> 00:01:29,500
Except for the occasional longer period of maintenance, most commercial aircraft won't

20
00:01:29,500 --> 00:01:34,740
go a day in their lives without taking the skies, but in this case, aircraft will have

21
00:01:34,740 --> 00:01:40,320
sat, abandoned, for more than a year by the time the MAX is cleared to fly again.

22
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:45,940
The process of getting those 800 aircraft to the skies will not be quick or easy.

23
00:01:45,940 --> 00:01:49,820
Getting the MAX flying again is also more complicated than just gaining the FAA's

24
00:01:49,820 --> 00:01:51,700
approval for their fixes.

25
00:01:51,700 --> 00:01:55,920
One commissioned survey found that 70% of American travelers say they will avoid flying

26
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:59,300
on the MAX, even when it is recertified.

27
00:01:59,300 --> 00:02:03,900
Boeing has to persuade regulators it can fly, and then it has to persuade the public it

28
00:02:03,900 --> 00:02:04,900
can fly.

29
00:02:04,900 --> 00:02:11,580
It will be a massive, monumental effort by the company and the airlines.

30
00:02:11,580 --> 00:02:16,820
The first thing that we don't know about the 737 MAX's return is when it will happen.

31
00:02:16,820 --> 00:02:21,380
When it was first grounded back in March 2019, Boeing expected the aircraft to be flying

32
00:02:21,380 --> 00:02:23,980
again in a matter of weeks.

33
00:02:23,980 --> 00:02:28,900
Since then, the date of return has been pushed back and pushed back and pushed back again.

34
00:02:28,900 --> 00:02:35,060
At the time of writing, Boeing says the aircraft will fly again in mid-2020 but, just like

35
00:02:35,060 --> 00:02:39,860
every time before, it's quite possible that it will slip further.

36
00:02:39,860 --> 00:02:44,460
Another unknown is exactly how, from a technical standpoint, Boeing will fix the issues that

37
00:02:44,460 --> 00:02:48,860
caused the two crashes, in addition to a number of other issues that have been identified

38
00:02:48,860 --> 00:02:50,180
since then.

39
00:02:50,180 --> 00:02:55,540
What we do know is that, once Boeing is satisfied that it has indeed reached a solution, it

40
00:02:55,540 --> 00:02:59,460
will notify the FAA and schedule a certification flight.

41
00:02:59,460 --> 00:03:05,180
For this, Boeing will provide one 737 MAX aircraft with any and all physical and software

42
00:03:05,180 --> 00:03:09,780
tweaks installed, and FAA pilots will take to the skies to determine if the fixes are

43
00:03:09,780 --> 00:03:10,780
satisfactory.

44
00:03:10,780 --> 00:03:15,540
What will follow is a short, few-day analysis period and, assuming the fixes seem to be

45
00:03:15,540 --> 00:03:20,900
working, the process will be passed on to the Joint Operations Evaluation Board.

46
00:03:20,900 --> 00:03:26,460
This is a FAA-run group made up primarily of 737 MAX pilots from around the world whose

47
00:03:26,460 --> 00:03:31,420
job it is to determine what sort of training pilots will need before flying the 737 MAX

48
00:03:31,420 --> 00:03:32,500
again.

49
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:36,900
These pilots will each try the fixes in a simulator in order to have first-hand experience

50
00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:41,800
and then, after about two weeks, the board will pass their recommendation onto the FAA's

51
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:45,720
State Standardization Board who will incorporate the recommendations into a report.

52
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:51,460
It is this step that is expected to establish a tremendous hurdle to the MAX's re-entry

53
00:03:51,460 --> 00:03:52,680
to service.

54
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:57,880
It is expected, on Boeing's recommendation, that the FAA will require simulator training

55
00:03:57,880 --> 00:04:01,240
before MAX pilots can fly the aircraft again.

56
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:05,960
It'd be easy to underestimate how significant this is.

57
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:11,200
The entire MAX aircraft was designed around assuring that pilots would not need simulator

58
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:12,480
training.

59
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:17,420
Boeing wanted the MAX to seamlessly fit into the airline's fleet of older 737 aircraft

60
00:04:17,420 --> 00:04:23,600
so that the same pilot who flies a 30-year-old 737 can fly a brand new 737 MAX.

61
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:29,120
That's because pilot training is hugely expensive and so a lack of need for it would,

62
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:34,180
by extension, lower the cost of operating the 737 MAX to airlines.

63
00:04:34,180 --> 00:04:38,440
Boeing boasted in marketing materials that it would take only two days of computer-based

64
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:43,080
training to certify an existing 737 pilot to fly the MAX.

65
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:47,880
The push for limited training was even a major factor behind the implementation of the MCAS

66
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:50,640
system that caused the two MAX aircraft to crash.

67
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:55,680
They wanted the plane to fly like it was any other 737 even though, without electronic

68
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:58,120
intervention, it did not.

69
00:04:58,120 --> 00:05:03,280
Because of all of this, very few 737 MAX simulators were made.

70
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:08,040
Only two companies manufacture them—CAE and True Simulation.

71
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:11,920
The simulators are not a whole lot cheaper than the aircraft themselves.

72
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:18,020
A full-movement 737 MAX simulator is estimated to cost up to $15 million and therefore the

73
00:05:18,020 --> 00:05:21,040
hourly cost to run one of these is in the thousands.

74
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:25,340
They're just hugely complicated machines to develop to the level that they accurately

75
00:05:25,340 --> 00:05:29,440
mimic the flight characteristics of a real aircraft.

76
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:33,440
Accuracy is what is needed in order to use them for training in place of a real plane

77
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:38,600
which, given fuel, cost airlines quite a bit more to run, but given the little prior

78
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:45,160
demand for 737 MAX simulators, only 34 exist worldwide.

79
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:52,300
Just as an exercise, say 5,000 pilots are needed to fly the 387 grounded MAX aircraft.

80
00:05:52,300 --> 00:05:57,900
If ten hours of simulator training are needed and every simulator in existence is used 24-7,

81
00:05:57,900 --> 00:06:02,080
it would take two whole months to get those pilots trained.

82
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:06,600
In reality, pilot numbers are likely larger, necessary training hours could be higher,

83
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:09,040
and efficiency will be lower.

84
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:14,060
Simulator training will be a huge bottleneck to the re-entry process.

85
00:06:14,060 --> 00:06:19,020
Many MAX operating airlines own their own simulators, but many others do not.

86
00:06:19,020 --> 00:06:24,140
For example, Eastarjet, a South Korean operator, does not and therefore needs to find simulator

87
00:06:24,140 --> 00:06:27,200
availability in order to get their planes flying again.

88
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:31,800
For the simulators owned by airlines, their owners are undoubtedly going to prioritize

89
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:36,320
their own pilots for training first, so those won't have availability for quite a while,

90
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:40,240
while among simulators owned by training centers, these centers are much more likely to want

91
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:44,920
to please a huge airline like American Airlines than tiny Eastarjet.

92
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:49,020
Many of these smaller airlines are going to be at the end of a long list to get their

93
00:06:49,020 --> 00:06:50,800
pilots trained.

94
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:54,880
Even the big airlines will be sending their pilots to all corners of the globe to get

95
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:56,280
simulator time.

96
00:06:56,280 --> 00:07:00,460
Fiji Airways, for example, owns a simulator in Fiji and will quickly be able to train

97
00:07:00,460 --> 00:07:06,160
all their pilots, and therefore other airlines are lining up to pay big money to use it.

98
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:10,840
Other simulators with availability also exist in Iceland, Panama, and more, so airlines

99
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:15,580
are scouring around the world for anyone who will give them hours.

100
00:07:15,580 --> 00:07:20,360
This is all, of course, though, dependent on what exactly the FAA Flight Standardization

101
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:24,000
Board decides is required to train pilots.

102
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:28,780
Sometime soon after the conclusion of that phase in the process, the FAA will issue an

103
00:07:28,780 --> 00:07:31,020
Airworthiness Directive.

104
00:07:31,020 --> 00:07:35,300
This is the official order that says, for one, that the MAX can fly again, but it is

105
00:07:35,300 --> 00:07:39,620
also the final and definitive document outlining what steps airlines need to take in terms

106
00:07:39,620 --> 00:07:44,980
of aircraft modification and training so their specific aircraft and pilots can fly again.

107
00:07:44,980 --> 00:07:48,740
This directive, though, does not mean work is over and the hundreds of grounded aircraft

108
00:07:48,740 --> 00:07:51,920
can fly again—quite the opposite, in fact.

109
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:54,780
This is where the real work begins.

110
00:07:54,780 --> 00:08:01,340
All of the 387 grounded aircraft have been just sitting there, largely abandoned.

111
00:08:01,340 --> 00:08:05,460
Keeping them each in the same state of maintenance as an aircraft actively flying in a given

112
00:08:05,460 --> 00:08:09,720
airline's fleet would be hugely expensive, so most operators have largely left their

113
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:11,140
aircraft be.

114
00:08:11,140 --> 00:08:16,040
Therefore, each aircraft needs to go through a process of testing all systems and components,

115
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:20,180
in addition to a deep clean, to be sure they're truly ready to fly.

116
00:08:20,180 --> 00:08:24,380
They also, of course, need to have Boeing's revised software installed.

117
00:08:24,380 --> 00:08:29,280
This whole process is expected to take, for each aircraft, up to two weeks.

118
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:34,020
As soon as airlines know with relative certainty the timing of the MAX's re-entry, they're

119
00:08:34,020 --> 00:08:38,700
likely to shuffle resources around to dedicate as many mechanics as possible to aircraft

120
00:08:38,700 --> 00:08:39,700
re-entry.

121
00:08:39,700 --> 00:08:42,900
That could mean delaying heavy maintenance on other aircraft.

122
00:08:42,900 --> 00:08:47,140
Boeing will also have to go through an even more exhaustive process for the 400 or so

123
00:08:47,140 --> 00:08:51,760
MAX jets that they have built since the beginning of the grounding that now sit at their factories

124
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:53,220
undelivered.

125
00:08:53,220 --> 00:08:56,660
Each of these aircraft are at a stage just short of completion.

126
00:08:56,660 --> 00:09:01,180
They're built, for the most part, but still significant amounts of work need to be done

127
00:09:01,180 --> 00:09:04,060
before they're ready to be delivered to customers.

128
00:09:04,060 --> 00:09:08,540
Clearing that backlog is expected to take about a year.

129
00:09:08,540 --> 00:09:12,420
Following this, airlines will need to rework the MAX into their schedules.

130
00:09:12,420 --> 00:09:16,760
If the re-entry happens during the most profitable summer season, one could expect this to happen

131
00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:21,180
quite quickly, possibly even with airlines scheduling extra flights given the extra capacity.

132
00:09:21,860 --> 00:09:25,300
If it's in the less busy times of year, though, it could be quite a while before the

133
00:09:25,300 --> 00:09:31,580
MAX is fully reincorporated into airline schedules, which are planned sometimes years in advance.

134
00:09:31,580 --> 00:09:36,460
The biggest unknown, though, happens when the MAX is back in service.

135
00:09:36,460 --> 00:09:39,980
Will passengers fly on the beleaguered aircraft?

136
00:09:39,980 --> 00:09:42,260
History says yes.

137
00:09:42,260 --> 00:09:46,340
After other popular aircraft have been grounded in the past for safety reasons, there has

138
00:09:46,340 --> 00:09:50,780
never been a serious issue with the consumer boycott of the plane type, but passengers

139
00:09:50,780 --> 00:09:56,540
do have something that they didn't have back decades ago in similar cases—information.

140
00:09:56,540 --> 00:10:02,000
For one, never has an aircraft grounding been such a media event.

141
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:06,240
In addition, before the last few decades, flight bookings typically happened through

142
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:10,080
a travel agent and the consumer wouldn't really know which aircraft type they were

143
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:11,080
booked on.

144
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:16,460
Nowadays, booking online, aircraft type is clearly displayed and given the choice, a

145
00:10:16,460 --> 00:10:19,980
consumer might choose to fly on other aircraft over the MAX.

146
00:10:19,980 --> 00:10:25,580
Finally, social media has the power to escalate groupthink in such a situation.

147
00:10:25,580 --> 00:10:29,260
One video of a passenger having an anxiety attack upon learning they're flying on a

148
00:10:29,260 --> 00:10:33,780
737 MAX could go viral and cause mass anxiety.

149
00:10:33,780 --> 00:10:36,180
Boeing is preparing for all of this.

150
00:10:36,180 --> 00:10:40,340
They've been developing a plan for how to respond to passenger anxiety anywhere from

151
00:10:40,340 --> 00:10:42,920
during the booking process to in-flight.

152
00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:47,280
Part of the plan includes monitoring social media and, if a passenger is publishing concerns

153
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:52,040
in-flight or in the airport, responding to this digitally and notifying flight crew about

154
00:10:52,040 --> 00:10:53,040
the individual.

155
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:57,440
They also plan on having employees distribute small cards with information on the aircraft

156
00:10:57,440 --> 00:11:01,760
safety and the changes to anyone anxious, in addition to creating explainer videos for

157
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:03,680
those who want to learn more.

158
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:07,880
Boeing will also no doubt spend huge amounts of resources conducting a public information

159
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:13,160
campaign to quell concerns about the aircraft because, if passengers won't fly the aircraft,

160
00:11:13,160 --> 00:11:15,600
airlines won't buy it.

161
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:19,460
Truly everything is on the line for Boeing with this re-entry.

162
00:11:19,460 --> 00:11:24,280
The aircraft is Boeing's cash cow and the entire company is centered around it.

163
00:11:24,280 --> 00:11:30,200
What's just been described is only the plan, and if any step in it fails, the entire process

164
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:31,200
failed.

165
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:36,240
Few things have gone to plan with the 737 MAX so far, so the stakes for Boeing have

166
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:39,080
never been higher.

167
00:11:39,080 --> 00:11:42,980
There are certain things that delineate the level of professionalism one is perceived

168
00:11:42,980 --> 00:11:47,480
to have online, one of which is certainly their email address.

169
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:52,460
Having an address ending in Gmail or Outlook or iCloud just looks amateur, especially given

170
00:11:52,460 --> 00:11:56,660
how easy it is to get an email address ending in a custom domain.

171
00:11:56,660 --> 00:12:00,340
All you have to do is go to hover and find a custom domain you like.

172
00:12:00,340 --> 00:12:02,900
For example, I use wendover.productions.

173
00:12:02,900 --> 00:12:08,740
Then, after purchasing that in about 90 seconds, it takes about 30 seconds to set up your email

174
00:12:08,740 --> 00:12:09,740
address.

175
00:12:09,740 --> 00:12:14,820
You'll also, in the process, have a custom domain that you can use for any future website.

176
00:12:14,820 --> 00:12:19,980
Hover also has hundreds of domain extensions so you can really get creative with your domain.

177
00:12:19,980 --> 00:12:24,260
Hover is made to be simple, and your decision to get a custom email is also made simpler

178
00:12:24,260 --> 00:12:28,780
by the fact that, by going to hover.com slash wendover, you'll get 10% off their already

179
00:12:28,780 --> 00:12:32,060
reasonable prices and help support Wendover Productions.
