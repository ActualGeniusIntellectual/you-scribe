9260	18680	About one year ago, in mid-March 2019, Boeing's 737 MAX was quickly and unceremoniously grounded.
18680	22620	This was hugely significant in quite a few different ways.
22620	27460	For Boeing, the MAX was the newest generation of their most popular aircraft series and
27460	32380	its difficulties place a huge stain on the company's stellar safety and reliability
32380	33380	record.
33380	37620	Meanwhile, for the US, it halts growth at one of the country's largest companies and
37620	44340	employers, and then beyond that, for the worldwide aviation industry, it puts 387 aircraft on
44340	49760	the ground at a time of continued growth for most every airline worldwide.
49760	55340	Everyone knows why the 737 MAX was grounded by now—faulty sensors would, in particular
55340	59860	circumstances, indicate incorrect information to software which would respond by sending
59860	61660	the aircraft into a nosedive.
61660	66780	What's less known is how Boeing will get the 737 MAX flying again.
66780	71800	In addition to the 387 aircraft that were flying prior to the grounding, Boeing kept
71800	76860	production going for nine months after this so there are about another 400 completely
76860	82780	assembled aircraft sitting on every empty piece of tarmac outside Boeing's factory.
82780	85580	Aircraft are not built to sit around.
85580	89500	Except for the occasional longer period of maintenance, most commercial aircraft won't
89500	94740	go a day in their lives without taking the skies, but in this case, aircraft will have
94740	100320	sat, abandoned, for more than a year by the time the MAX is cleared to fly again.
100320	105940	The process of getting those 800 aircraft to the skies will not be quick or easy.
105940	109820	Getting the MAX flying again is also more complicated than just gaining the FAA's
109820	111700	approval for their fixes.
111700	115920	One commissioned survey found that 70% of American travelers say they will avoid flying
115920	119300	on the MAX, even when it is recertified.
119300	123900	Boeing has to persuade regulators it can fly, and then it has to persuade the public it
123900	124900	can fly.
124900	131580	It will be a massive, monumental effort by the company and the airlines.
131580	136820	The first thing that we don't know about the 737 MAX's return is when it will happen.
136820	141380	When it was first grounded back in March 2019, Boeing expected the aircraft to be flying
141380	143980	again in a matter of weeks.
143980	148900	Since then, the date of return has been pushed back and pushed back and pushed back again.
148900	155060	At the time of writing, Boeing says the aircraft will fly again in mid-2020 but, just like
155060	159860	every time before, it's quite possible that it will slip further.
159860	164460	Another unknown is exactly how, from a technical standpoint, Boeing will fix the issues that
164460	168860	caused the two crashes, in addition to a number of other issues that have been identified
168860	170180	since then.
170180	175540	What we do know is that, once Boeing is satisfied that it has indeed reached a solution, it
175540	179460	will notify the FAA and schedule a certification flight.
179460	185180	For this, Boeing will provide one 737 MAX aircraft with any and all physical and software
185180	189780	tweaks installed, and FAA pilots will take to the skies to determine if the fixes are
189780	190780	satisfactory.
190780	195540	What will follow is a short, few-day analysis period and, assuming the fixes seem to be
195540	200900	working, the process will be passed on to the Joint Operations Evaluation Board.
200900	206460	This is a FAA-run group made up primarily of 737 MAX pilots from around the world whose
206460	211420	job it is to determine what sort of training pilots will need before flying the 737 MAX
211420	212500	again.
212500	216900	These pilots will each try the fixes in a simulator in order to have first-hand experience
216900	221800	and then, after about two weeks, the board will pass their recommendation onto the FAA's
221800	225720	State Standardization Board who will incorporate the recommendations into a report.
225720	231460	It is this step that is expected to establish a tremendous hurdle to the MAX's re-entry
231460	232680	to service.
232680	237880	It is expected, on Boeing's recommendation, that the FAA will require simulator training
237880	241240	before MAX pilots can fly the aircraft again.
241240	245960	It'd be easy to underestimate how significant this is.
245960	251200	The entire MAX aircraft was designed around assuring that pilots would not need simulator
251200	252480	training.
252480	257420	Boeing wanted the MAX to seamlessly fit into the airline's fleet of older 737 aircraft
257420	263600	so that the same pilot who flies a 30-year-old 737 can fly a brand new 737 MAX.
263600	269120	That's because pilot training is hugely expensive and so a lack of need for it would,
269120	274180	by extension, lower the cost of operating the 737 MAX to airlines.
274180	278440	Boeing boasted in marketing materials that it would take only two days of computer-based
278440	283080	training to certify an existing 737 pilot to fly the MAX.
283080	287880	The push for limited training was even a major factor behind the implementation of the MCAS
287880	290640	system that caused the two MAX aircraft to crash.
290640	295680	They wanted the plane to fly like it was any other 737 even though, without electronic
295680	298120	intervention, it did not.
298120	303280	Because of all of this, very few 737 MAX simulators were made.
303280	308040	Only two companies manufacture them—CAE and True Simulation.
308040	311920	The simulators are not a whole lot cheaper than the aircraft themselves.
311920	318020	A full-movement 737 MAX simulator is estimated to cost up to $15 million and therefore the
318020	321040	hourly cost to run one of these is in the thousands.
321040	325340	They're just hugely complicated machines to develop to the level that they accurately
325340	329440	mimic the flight characteristics of a real aircraft.
329440	333440	Accuracy is what is needed in order to use them for training in place of a real plane
333440	338600	which, given fuel, cost airlines quite a bit more to run, but given the little prior
338600	345160	demand for 737 MAX simulators, only 34 exist worldwide.
345160	352300	Just as an exercise, say 5,000 pilots are needed to fly the 387 grounded MAX aircraft.
352300	357900	If ten hours of simulator training are needed and every simulator in existence is used 24-7,
357900	362080	it would take two whole months to get those pilots trained.
362080	366600	In reality, pilot numbers are likely larger, necessary training hours could be higher,
366600	369040	and efficiency will be lower.
369040	374060	Simulator training will be a huge bottleneck to the re-entry process.
374060	379020	Many MAX operating airlines own their own simulators, but many others do not.
379020	384140	For example, Eastarjet, a South Korean operator, does not and therefore needs to find simulator
384140	387200	availability in order to get their planes flying again.
387200	391800	For the simulators owned by airlines, their owners are undoubtedly going to prioritize
391800	396320	their own pilots for training first, so those won't have availability for quite a while,
396320	400240	while among simulators owned by training centers, these centers are much more likely to want
400240	404920	to please a huge airline like American Airlines than tiny Eastarjet.
404920	409020	Many of these smaller airlines are going to be at the end of a long list to get their
409020	410800	pilots trained.
410800	414880	Even the big airlines will be sending their pilots to all corners of the globe to get
414880	416280	simulator time.
416280	420460	Fiji Airways, for example, owns a simulator in Fiji and will quickly be able to train
420460	426160	all their pilots, and therefore other airlines are lining up to pay big money to use it.
426160	430840	Other simulators with availability also exist in Iceland, Panama, and more, so airlines
430840	435580	are scouring around the world for anyone who will give them hours.
435580	440360	This is all, of course, though, dependent on what exactly the FAA Flight Standardization
440360	444000	Board decides is required to train pilots.
444000	448780	Sometime soon after the conclusion of that phase in the process, the FAA will issue an
448780	451020	Airworthiness Directive.
451020	455300	This is the official order that says, for one, that the MAX can fly again, but it is
455300	459620	also the final and definitive document outlining what steps airlines need to take in terms
459620	464980	of aircraft modification and training so their specific aircraft and pilots can fly again.
464980	468740	This directive, though, does not mean work is over and the hundreds of grounded aircraft
468740	471920	can fly again—quite the opposite, in fact.
471920	474780	This is where the real work begins.
474780	481340	All of the 387 grounded aircraft have been just sitting there, largely abandoned.
481340	485460	Keeping them each in the same state of maintenance as an aircraft actively flying in a given
485460	489720	airline's fleet would be hugely expensive, so most operators have largely left their
489720	491140	aircraft be.
491140	496040	Therefore, each aircraft needs to go through a process of testing all systems and components,
496040	500180	in addition to a deep clean, to be sure they're truly ready to fly.
500180	504380	They also, of course, need to have Boeing's revised software installed.
504380	509280	This whole process is expected to take, for each aircraft, up to two weeks.
509280	514020	As soon as airlines know with relative certainty the timing of the MAX's re-entry, they're
514020	518700	likely to shuffle resources around to dedicate as many mechanics as possible to aircraft
518700	519700	re-entry.
519700	522900	That could mean delaying heavy maintenance on other aircraft.
522900	527140	Boeing will also have to go through an even more exhaustive process for the 400 or so
527140	531760	MAX jets that they have built since the beginning of the grounding that now sit at their factories
531760	533220	undelivered.
533220	536660	Each of these aircraft are at a stage just short of completion.
536660	541180	They're built, for the most part, but still significant amounts of work need to be done
541180	544060	before they're ready to be delivered to customers.
544060	548540	Clearing that backlog is expected to take about a year.
548540	552420	Following this, airlines will need to rework the MAX into their schedules.
552420	556760	If the re-entry happens during the most profitable summer season, one could expect this to happen
556760	561180	quite quickly, possibly even with airlines scheduling extra flights given the extra capacity.
561860	565300	If it's in the less busy times of year, though, it could be quite a while before the
565300	571580	MAX is fully reincorporated into airline schedules, which are planned sometimes years in advance.
571580	576460	The biggest unknown, though, happens when the MAX is back in service.
576460	579980	Will passengers fly on the beleaguered aircraft?
579980	582260	History says yes.
582260	586340	After other popular aircraft have been grounded in the past for safety reasons, there has
586340	590780	never been a serious issue with the consumer boycott of the plane type, but passengers
590780	596540	do have something that they didn't have back decades ago in similar cases—information.
596540	602000	For one, never has an aircraft grounding been such a media event.
602000	606240	In addition, before the last few decades, flight bookings typically happened through
606240	610080	a travel agent and the consumer wouldn't really know which aircraft type they were
610080	611080	booked on.
611080	616460	Nowadays, booking online, aircraft type is clearly displayed and given the choice, a
616460	619980	consumer might choose to fly on other aircraft over the MAX.
619980	625580	Finally, social media has the power to escalate groupthink in such a situation.
625580	629260	One video of a passenger having an anxiety attack upon learning they're flying on a
629260	633780	737 MAX could go viral and cause mass anxiety.
633780	636180	Boeing is preparing for all of this.
636180	640340	They've been developing a plan for how to respond to passenger anxiety anywhere from
640340	642920	during the booking process to in-flight.
642920	647280	Part of the plan includes monitoring social media and, if a passenger is publishing concerns
647280	652040	in-flight or in the airport, responding to this digitally and notifying flight crew about
652040	653040	the individual.
653040	657440	They also plan on having employees distribute small cards with information on the aircraft
657440	661760	safety and the changes to anyone anxious, in addition to creating explainer videos for
661760	663680	those who want to learn more.
663680	667880	Boeing will also no doubt spend huge amounts of resources conducting a public information
667880	673160	campaign to quell concerns about the aircraft because, if passengers won't fly the aircraft,
673160	675600	airlines won't buy it.
675600	679460	Truly everything is on the line for Boeing with this re-entry.
679460	684280	The aircraft is Boeing's cash cow and the entire company is centered around it.
684280	690200	What's just been described is only the plan, and if any step in it fails, the entire process
690200	691200	failed.
691200	696240	Few things have gone to plan with the 737 MAX so far, so the stakes for Boeing have
696240	699080	never been higher.
699080	702980	There are certain things that delineate the level of professionalism one is perceived
702980	707480	to have online, one of which is certainly their email address.
707480	712460	Having an address ending in Gmail or Outlook or iCloud just looks amateur, especially given
712460	716660	how easy it is to get an email address ending in a custom domain.
716660	720340	All you have to do is go to hover and find a custom domain you like.
720340	722900	For example, I use wendover.productions.
722900	728740	Then, after purchasing that in about 90 seconds, it takes about 30 seconds to set up your email
728740	729740	address.
729740	734820	You'll also, in the process, have a custom domain that you can use for any future website.
734820	739980	Hover also has hundreds of domain extensions so you can really get creative with your domain.
739980	744260	Hover is made to be simple, and your decision to get a custom email is also made simpler
744260	748780	by the fact that, by going to hover.com slash wendover, you'll get 10% off their already
748780	752060	reasonable prices and help support Wendover Productions.
