00:09.260 --> 00:18.680
About one year ago, in mid-March 2019, Boeing's 737 MAX was quickly and unceremoniously grounded.

00:18.680 --> 00:22.620
This was hugely significant in quite a few different ways.

00:22.620 --> 00:27.460
For Boeing, the MAX was the newest generation of their most popular aircraft series and

00:27.460 --> 00:32.380
its difficulties place a huge stain on the company's stellar safety and reliability

00:32.380 --> 00:33.380
record.

00:33.380 --> 00:37.620
Meanwhile, for the US, it halts growth at one of the country's largest companies and

00:37.620 --> 00:44.340
employers, and then beyond that, for the worldwide aviation industry, it puts 387 aircraft on

00:44.340 --> 00:49.760
the ground at a time of continued growth for most every airline worldwide.

00:49.760 --> 00:55.340
Everyone knows why the 737 MAX was grounded by now—faulty sensors would, in particular

00:55.340 --> 00:59.860
circumstances, indicate incorrect information to software which would respond by sending

00:59.860 --> 01:01.660
the aircraft into a nosedive.

01:01.660 --> 01:06.780
What's less known is how Boeing will get the 737 MAX flying again.

01:06.780 --> 01:11.800
In addition to the 387 aircraft that were flying prior to the grounding, Boeing kept

01:11.800 --> 01:16.860
production going for nine months after this so there are about another 400 completely

01:16.860 --> 01:22.780
assembled aircraft sitting on every empty piece of tarmac outside Boeing's factory.

01:22.780 --> 01:25.580
Aircraft are not built to sit around.

01:25.580 --> 01:29.500
Except for the occasional longer period of maintenance, most commercial aircraft won't

01:29.500 --> 01:34.740
go a day in their lives without taking the skies, but in this case, aircraft will have

01:34.740 --> 01:40.320
sat, abandoned, for more than a year by the time the MAX is cleared to fly again.

01:40.320 --> 01:45.940
The process of getting those 800 aircraft to the skies will not be quick or easy.

01:45.940 --> 01:49.820
Getting the MAX flying again is also more complicated than just gaining the FAA's

01:49.820 --> 01:51.700
approval for their fixes.

01:51.700 --> 01:55.920
One commissioned survey found that 70% of American travelers say they will avoid flying

01:55.920 --> 01:59.300
on the MAX, even when it is recertified.

01:59.300 --> 02:03.900
Boeing has to persuade regulators it can fly, and then it has to persuade the public it

02:03.900 --> 02:04.900
can fly.

02:04.900 --> 02:11.580
It will be a massive, monumental effort by the company and the airlines.

02:11.580 --> 02:16.820
The first thing that we don't know about the 737 MAX's return is when it will happen.

02:16.820 --> 02:21.380
When it was first grounded back in March 2019, Boeing expected the aircraft to be flying

02:21.380 --> 02:23.980
again in a matter of weeks.

02:23.980 --> 02:28.900
Since then, the date of return has been pushed back and pushed back and pushed back again.

02:28.900 --> 02:35.060
At the time of writing, Boeing says the aircraft will fly again in mid-2020 but, just like

02:35.060 --> 02:39.860
every time before, it's quite possible that it will slip further.

02:39.860 --> 02:44.460
Another unknown is exactly how, from a technical standpoint, Boeing will fix the issues that

02:44.460 --> 02:48.860
caused the two crashes, in addition to a number of other issues that have been identified

02:48.860 --> 02:50.180
since then.

02:50.180 --> 02:55.540
What we do know is that, once Boeing is satisfied that it has indeed reached a solution, it

02:55.540 --> 02:59.460
will notify the FAA and schedule a certification flight.

02:59.460 --> 03:05.180
For this, Boeing will provide one 737 MAX aircraft with any and all physical and software

03:05.180 --> 03:09.780
tweaks installed, and FAA pilots will take to the skies to determine if the fixes are

03:09.780 --> 03:10.780
satisfactory.

03:10.780 --> 03:15.540
What will follow is a short, few-day analysis period and, assuming the fixes seem to be

03:15.540 --> 03:20.900
working, the process will be passed on to the Joint Operations Evaluation Board.

03:20.900 --> 03:26.460
This is a FAA-run group made up primarily of 737 MAX pilots from around the world whose

03:26.460 --> 03:31.420
job it is to determine what sort of training pilots will need before flying the 737 MAX

03:31.420 --> 03:32.500
again.

03:32.500 --> 03:36.900
These pilots will each try the fixes in a simulator in order to have first-hand experience

03:36.900 --> 03:41.800
and then, after about two weeks, the board will pass their recommendation onto the FAA's

03:41.800 --> 03:45.720
State Standardization Board who will incorporate the recommendations into a report.

03:45.720 --> 03:51.460
It is this step that is expected to establish a tremendous hurdle to the MAX's re-entry

03:51.460 --> 03:52.680
to service.

03:52.680 --> 03:57.880
It is expected, on Boeing's recommendation, that the FAA will require simulator training

03:57.880 --> 04:01.240
before MAX pilots can fly the aircraft again.

04:01.240 --> 04:05.960
It'd be easy to underestimate how significant this is.

04:05.960 --> 04:11.200
The entire MAX aircraft was designed around assuring that pilots would not need simulator

04:11.200 --> 04:12.480
training.

04:12.480 --> 04:17.420
Boeing wanted the MAX to seamlessly fit into the airline's fleet of older 737 aircraft

04:17.420 --> 04:23.600
so that the same pilot who flies a 30-year-old 737 can fly a brand new 737 MAX.

04:23.600 --> 04:29.120
That's because pilot training is hugely expensive and so a lack of need for it would,

04:29.120 --> 04:34.180
by extension, lower the cost of operating the 737 MAX to airlines.

04:34.180 --> 04:38.440
Boeing boasted in marketing materials that it would take only two days of computer-based

04:38.440 --> 04:43.080
training to certify an existing 737 pilot to fly the MAX.

04:43.080 --> 04:47.880
The push for limited training was even a major factor behind the implementation of the MCAS

04:47.880 --> 04:50.640
system that caused the two MAX aircraft to crash.

04:50.640 --> 04:55.680
They wanted the plane to fly like it was any other 737 even though, without electronic

04:55.680 --> 04:58.120
intervention, it did not.

04:58.120 --> 05:03.280
Because of all of this, very few 737 MAX simulators were made.

05:03.280 --> 05:08.040
Only two companies manufacture them—CAE and True Simulation.

05:08.040 --> 05:11.920
The simulators are not a whole lot cheaper than the aircraft themselves.

05:11.920 --> 05:18.020
A full-movement 737 MAX simulator is estimated to cost up to $15 million and therefore the

05:18.020 --> 05:21.040
hourly cost to run one of these is in the thousands.

05:21.040 --> 05:25.340
They're just hugely complicated machines to develop to the level that they accurately

05:25.340 --> 05:29.440
mimic the flight characteristics of a real aircraft.

05:29.440 --> 05:33.440
Accuracy is what is needed in order to use them for training in place of a real plane

05:33.440 --> 05:38.600
which, given fuel, cost airlines quite a bit more to run, but given the little prior

05:38.600 --> 05:45.160
demand for 737 MAX simulators, only 34 exist worldwide.

05:45.160 --> 05:52.300
Just as an exercise, say 5,000 pilots are needed to fly the 387 grounded MAX aircraft.

05:52.300 --> 05:57.900
If ten hours of simulator training are needed and every simulator in existence is used 24-7,

05:57.900 --> 06:02.080
it would take two whole months to get those pilots trained.

06:02.080 --> 06:06.600
In reality, pilot numbers are likely larger, necessary training hours could be higher,

06:06.600 --> 06:09.040
and efficiency will be lower.

06:09.040 --> 06:14.060
Simulator training will be a huge bottleneck to the re-entry process.

06:14.060 --> 06:19.020
Many MAX operating airlines own their own simulators, but many others do not.

06:19.020 --> 06:24.140
For example, Eastarjet, a South Korean operator, does not and therefore needs to find simulator

06:24.140 --> 06:27.200
availability in order to get their planes flying again.

06:27.200 --> 06:31.800
For the simulators owned by airlines, their owners are undoubtedly going to prioritize

06:31.800 --> 06:36.320
their own pilots for training first, so those won't have availability for quite a while,

06:36.320 --> 06:40.240
while among simulators owned by training centers, these centers are much more likely to want

06:40.240 --> 06:44.920
to please a huge airline like American Airlines than tiny Eastarjet.

06:44.920 --> 06:49.020
Many of these smaller airlines are going to be at the end of a long list to get their

06:49.020 --> 06:50.800
pilots trained.

06:50.800 --> 06:54.880
Even the big airlines will be sending their pilots to all corners of the globe to get

06:54.880 --> 06:56.280
simulator time.

06:56.280 --> 07:00.460
Fiji Airways, for example, owns a simulator in Fiji and will quickly be able to train

07:00.460 --> 07:06.160
all their pilots, and therefore other airlines are lining up to pay big money to use it.

07:06.160 --> 07:10.840
Other simulators with availability also exist in Iceland, Panama, and more, so airlines

07:10.840 --> 07:15.580
are scouring around the world for anyone who will give them hours.

07:15.580 --> 07:20.360
This is all, of course, though, dependent on what exactly the FAA Flight Standardization

07:20.360 --> 07:24.000
Board decides is required to train pilots.

07:24.000 --> 07:28.780
Sometime soon after the conclusion of that phase in the process, the FAA will issue an

07:28.780 --> 07:31.020
Airworthiness Directive.

07:31.020 --> 07:35.300
This is the official order that says, for one, that the MAX can fly again, but it is

07:35.300 --> 07:39.620
also the final and definitive document outlining what steps airlines need to take in terms

07:39.620 --> 07:44.980
of aircraft modification and training so their specific aircraft and pilots can fly again.

07:44.980 --> 07:48.740
This directive, though, does not mean work is over and the hundreds of grounded aircraft

07:48.740 --> 07:51.920
can fly again—quite the opposite, in fact.

07:51.920 --> 07:54.780
This is where the real work begins.

07:54.780 --> 08:01.340
All of the 387 grounded aircraft have been just sitting there, largely abandoned.

08:01.340 --> 08:05.460
Keeping them each in the same state of maintenance as an aircraft actively flying in a given

08:05.460 --> 08:09.720
airline's fleet would be hugely expensive, so most operators have largely left their

08:09.720 --> 08:11.140
aircraft be.

08:11.140 --> 08:16.040
Therefore, each aircraft needs to go through a process of testing all systems and components,

08:16.040 --> 08:20.180
in addition to a deep clean, to be sure they're truly ready to fly.

08:20.180 --> 08:24.380
They also, of course, need to have Boeing's revised software installed.

08:24.380 --> 08:29.280
This whole process is expected to take, for each aircraft, up to two weeks.

08:29.280 --> 08:34.020
As soon as airlines know with relative certainty the timing of the MAX's re-entry, they're

08:34.020 --> 08:38.700
likely to shuffle resources around to dedicate as many mechanics as possible to aircraft

08:38.700 --> 08:39.700
re-entry.

08:39.700 --> 08:42.900
That could mean delaying heavy maintenance on other aircraft.

08:42.900 --> 08:47.140
Boeing will also have to go through an even more exhaustive process for the 400 or so

08:47.140 --> 08:51.760
MAX jets that they have built since the beginning of the grounding that now sit at their factories

08:51.760 --> 08:53.220
undelivered.

08:53.220 --> 08:56.660
Each of these aircraft are at a stage just short of completion.

08:56.660 --> 09:01.180
They're built, for the most part, but still significant amounts of work need to be done

09:01.180 --> 09:04.060
before they're ready to be delivered to customers.

09:04.060 --> 09:08.540
Clearing that backlog is expected to take about a year.

09:08.540 --> 09:12.420
Following this, airlines will need to rework the MAX into their schedules.

09:12.420 --> 09:16.760
If the re-entry happens during the most profitable summer season, one could expect this to happen

09:16.760 --> 09:21.180
quite quickly, possibly even with airlines scheduling extra flights given the extra capacity.

09:21.860 --> 09:25.300
If it's in the less busy times of year, though, it could be quite a while before the

09:25.300 --> 09:31.580
MAX is fully reincorporated into airline schedules, which are planned sometimes years in advance.

09:31.580 --> 09:36.460
The biggest unknown, though, happens when the MAX is back in service.

09:36.460 --> 09:39.980
Will passengers fly on the beleaguered aircraft?

09:39.980 --> 09:42.260
History says yes.

09:42.260 --> 09:46.340
After other popular aircraft have been grounded in the past for safety reasons, there has

09:46.340 --> 09:50.780
never been a serious issue with the consumer boycott of the plane type, but passengers

09:50.780 --> 09:56.540
do have something that they didn't have back decades ago in similar cases—information.

09:56.540 --> 10:02.000
For one, never has an aircraft grounding been such a media event.

10:02.000 --> 10:06.240
In addition, before the last few decades, flight bookings typically happened through

10:06.240 --> 10:10.080
a travel agent and the consumer wouldn't really know which aircraft type they were

10:10.080 --> 10:11.080
booked on.

10:11.080 --> 10:16.460
Nowadays, booking online, aircraft type is clearly displayed and given the choice, a

10:16.460 --> 10:19.980
consumer might choose to fly on other aircraft over the MAX.

10:19.980 --> 10:25.580
Finally, social media has the power to escalate groupthink in such a situation.

10:25.580 --> 10:29.260
One video of a passenger having an anxiety attack upon learning they're flying on a

10:29.260 --> 10:33.780
737 MAX could go viral and cause mass anxiety.

10:33.780 --> 10:36.180
Boeing is preparing for all of this.

10:36.180 --> 10:40.340
They've been developing a plan for how to respond to passenger anxiety anywhere from

10:40.340 --> 10:42.920
during the booking process to in-flight.

10:42.920 --> 10:47.280
Part of the plan includes monitoring social media and, if a passenger is publishing concerns

10:47.280 --> 10:52.040
in-flight or in the airport, responding to this digitally and notifying flight crew about

10:52.040 --> 10:53.040
the individual.

10:53.040 --> 10:57.440
They also plan on having employees distribute small cards with information on the aircraft

10:57.440 --> 11:01.760
safety and the changes to anyone anxious, in addition to creating explainer videos for

11:01.760 --> 11:03.680
those who want to learn more.

11:03.680 --> 11:07.880
Boeing will also no doubt spend huge amounts of resources conducting a public information

11:07.880 --> 11:13.160
campaign to quell concerns about the aircraft because, if passengers won't fly the aircraft,

11:13.160 --> 11:15.600
airlines won't buy it.

11:15.600 --> 11:19.460
Truly everything is on the line for Boeing with this re-entry.

11:19.460 --> 11:24.280
The aircraft is Boeing's cash cow and the entire company is centered around it.

11:24.280 --> 11:30.200
What's just been described is only the plan, and if any step in it fails, the entire process

11:30.200 --> 11:31.200
failed.

11:31.200 --> 11:36.240
Few things have gone to plan with the 737 MAX so far, so the stakes for Boeing have

11:36.240 --> 11:39.080
never been higher.

11:39.080 --> 11:42.980
There are certain things that delineate the level of professionalism one is perceived

11:42.980 --> 11:47.480
to have online, one of which is certainly their email address.

11:47.480 --> 11:52.460
Having an address ending in Gmail or Outlook or iCloud just looks amateur, especially given

11:52.460 --> 11:56.660
how easy it is to get an email address ending in a custom domain.

11:56.660 --> 12:00.340
All you have to do is go to hover and find a custom domain you like.

12:00.340 --> 12:02.900
For example, I use wendover.productions.

12:02.900 --> 12:08.740
Then, after purchasing that in about 90 seconds, it takes about 30 seconds to set up your email

12:08.740 --> 12:09.740
address.

12:09.740 --> 12:14.820
You'll also, in the process, have a custom domain that you can use for any future website.

12:14.820 --> 12:19.980
Hover also has hundreds of domain extensions so you can really get creative with your domain.

12:19.980 --> 12:24.260
Hover is made to be simple, and your decision to get a custom email is also made simpler

12:24.260 --> 12:28.780
by the fact that, by going to hover.com slash wendover, you'll get 10% off their already

12:28.780 --> 12:32.060
reasonable prices and help support Wendover Productions.
