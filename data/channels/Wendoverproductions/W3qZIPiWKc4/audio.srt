1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,480
2021 was not a fresh start.

2
00:00:03,480 --> 00:00:07,760
A sampling of newspapers' front pages, a stroll through single-digit cable channels,

3
00:00:07,760 --> 00:00:11,920
a scroll through your trusted news sites, all advance the same sentiment.

4
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:17,280
A new year doesn't mean a new world, a fresh fourth digit doesn't refresh the headlines.

5
00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:22,520
Rather, 2021 was a year of news stories evolving, of headlines maturing.

6
00:00:22,520 --> 00:00:26,220
Pandemic stories went from panic and uncertainty over the virus to panic and uncertainty over

7
00:00:26,220 --> 00:00:28,360
the vaccine and its rollout.

8
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:32,280
Stories on paper product shortages turned into headlines outlining outright supply chain

9
00:00:32,280 --> 00:00:36,920
chaos—coverage of police violence, racial injustice, and subsequent protests moved from

10
00:00:36,920 --> 00:00:38,760
the streets and into the courtroom.

11
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:42,680
The strongest point of continuity from last year to this year, however, was that a host

12
00:00:42,680 --> 00:00:47,240
of stories burnt so bright that they left little oxygen for smaller ones to breathe.

13
00:00:47,240 --> 00:00:48,820
So, we did it again.

14
00:00:48,820 --> 00:00:54,120
We assembled a list of news stories, one for each country, that you likely missed in 2021.

15
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:55,680
Some rules are the same from last year.

16
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:59,380
We're not covering the big stories—you won't hear about America ending its longest

17
00:00:59,380 --> 00:01:03,720
war, the traffic jam in the Suez Canal, and you certainly won't hear me utter the all-consuming

18
00:01:03,720 --> 00:01:04,720
C-word.

19
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:09,280
In its absence, you'll notice that two other C-words came to dominate our headlines—climate

20
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:11,160
change and coup d'etat.

21
00:01:11,160 --> 00:01:13,720
These themes point to the change in this year's video.

22
00:01:13,720 --> 00:01:17,700
Rather than focusing on finding stories distant from the C-word, this edition's headlines

23
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:21,760
reflect the experience of each country's general populace—stories that often revolve

24
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:26,440
around responses to a rapidly changing world and unnervingly unstable governments.

25
00:01:26,440 --> 00:01:30,440
The stories aren't all dark, though—2021 was tough, but it was one filled with the

26
00:01:30,440 --> 00:01:32,680
heartening and, of course, the quirky.

27
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:36,840
Not only does this people-first focus inform the stories we chose, but also how we organize

28
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:38,800
the stories themselves.

29
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:42,680
Rather than going from most populous to least like last year, we're using the Human Development

30
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:44,080
Index, or HDI.

31
00:01:44,080 --> 00:01:48,600
HDI is a metric aimed to quantify standard of living, ranking each country between zero

32
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:53,480
and one based on three dimensions—a long and happy life, accumulation of education,

33
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:54,480
and earnings.

34
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:57,960
The United Nations compiles this list using an algorithm that includes indicators such

35
00:01:57,960 --> 00:02:02,240
as life expectancy at birth, gross national income per capita, and mean years of schooling

36
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:04,240
for adults 25 and over.

37
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:08,820
HDI was created to, as the UN states, quote, emphasize that people and their capability

38
00:02:08,820 --> 00:02:12,880
should be the ultimate criteria for assessing the development of a country, not economic

39
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:13,880
growth alone.

40
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:18,460
Put simply, HDI is the best metric available to frame this trip around the globe from the

41
00:02:18,460 --> 00:02:23,940
perspective of everyday people, but not all of the 196 UN-recognized countries and territories

42
00:02:23,940 --> 00:02:26,420
we cover have an HDI score.

43
00:02:26,420 --> 00:02:30,620
Missing statistics in per capita income, life expectancy, or years of education means that

44
00:02:30,620 --> 00:02:34,340
seven countries didn't have a score, but they did make news, so we'll start there

45
00:02:34,340 --> 00:02:36,940
and then go from lowest HDI to highest.

46
00:02:36,940 --> 00:02:40,580
We've spent a lot of time explaining, but you're here for the headlines, so let's

47
00:02:40,580 --> 00:02:43,340
get started with the first 98.

48
00:02:43,340 --> 00:02:48,220
We start this year in the country that the HDI calculators probably know the least about—North

49
00:02:48,220 --> 00:02:49,220
Korea.

50
00:02:49,220 --> 00:02:53,020
The Hermit Kingdom countered its natural disposition when it decided to reopen lines of communication

51
00:02:53,020 --> 00:02:56,860
with South Korea via the hotline that directly connects Seoul and Pyongyang.

52
00:02:56,860 --> 00:03:00,860
The hotlines existed in one form or another since the 1970s, but has been severed twice

53
00:03:00,860 --> 00:03:04,980
in the past two years on account of the failed Trump Summit with the North, and joint military

54
00:03:04,980 --> 00:03:07,620
exercises between the US and the South.

55
00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:11,680
From nations we'd like to know more about, to continents that spark curiosity, Venturi,

56
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:15,740
an innovative auto company and formerly E-team from Monaco, announced its plan to launch

57
00:03:15,740 --> 00:03:18,300
its electric polar exploration vehicle in Antarctica.

58
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:21,420
While the world's been sending vehicles down there for decades, Venturi's will be

59
00:03:21,420 --> 00:03:25,580
the first that spews zero emissions as it transports scientists across the continent

60
00:03:25,580 --> 00:03:27,700
to conduct important climate change research.

61
00:03:27,700 --> 00:03:31,700
While it's been tested on French ski resorts, the sole focus has been getting the vehicle

62
00:03:31,700 --> 00:03:36,200
ready for the southern continent—a mission laid bare by the vehicle's name, Antarctica.

63
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:40,860
The news out of Nauru suggested that 2021 wasn't one to critically rethink its international

64
00:03:40,860 --> 00:03:44,660
agreements, but a chance to double down—at least that was the case when the country renewed

65
00:03:44,660 --> 00:03:49,140
its deal with Australia to serve as an offshore processing location for asylum seekers looking

66
00:03:49,140 --> 00:03:51,180
to enter the popular migration destination.

67
00:03:51,180 --> 00:03:55,020
While the extension keeps the island nation in the good graces of regional power broker

68
00:03:55,020 --> 00:03:59,460
Australia, it keeps the island connected to and complicit in an asylum system that many,

69
00:03:59,460 --> 00:04:04,420
including the UN, has decried as cruel and inhuman with its delays, decrepit living conditions,

70
00:04:04,420 --> 00:04:05,980
and reports of abuse.

71
00:04:05,980 --> 00:04:10,900
2021 was an Olympics year, and one of the smallest countries in the world took two podiums—San

72
00:04:10,900 --> 00:04:15,880
Marino, a 23-square-mile, 60-square-kilometer enclave surrounded by Italy, earned its first

73
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:16,880
Olympic medal.

74
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:20,700
Women's trap shooter Alessandra Parilli took home a bronze during the Summer Games,

75
00:04:20,700 --> 00:04:25,700
but it wasn't just her award—now the country, with 33,000 people, came in first for being

76
00:04:25,700 --> 00:04:30,300
the least populated territory in the world to earn an Olympic medal, surpassing Bermuda's

77
00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:31,300
70,000.

78
00:04:31,300 --> 00:04:35,140
Somalia got its first taste of the silver screen in 30 years when the National Theatre

79
00:04:35,140 --> 00:04:39,580
of Somalia reopened for screening featuring two short films by a homegrown director.

80
00:04:39,580 --> 00:04:43,740
The theatre closed in 1991 at the start of the country's civil war, has been used frequently

81
00:04:43,740 --> 00:04:48,380
by warlords as their headquarters, and was then bombed by anti-entertainment jihadists.

82
00:04:48,380 --> 00:04:53,980
Its reopening, though tenuous and under heavy security, marked a flicker of hope for civilians—especially

83
00:04:53,980 --> 00:04:54,980
the flick-loving ones.

84
00:04:54,980 --> 00:04:58,540
And we're not even into the list, but we're already at climate change.

85
00:04:58,540 --> 00:05:02,920
Tuvalu's foreign minister went viral for addressing the COP26 climate summit knee-deep

86
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:06,700
in water—a strong image that demonstrates the peril facing the island nation, which

87
00:05:06,700 --> 00:05:09,980
only rises to 15 feet or 4.5 meters above sea level.

88
00:05:09,980 --> 00:05:14,100
He's asking that if the nation goes underwater, it can retain ownership to its maritime zones

89
00:05:14,100 --> 00:05:18,540
and rights as a state even if residents have to relocate—existential questions for a

90
00:05:18,540 --> 00:05:21,340
very non-existential crisis.

91
00:05:21,340 --> 00:05:25,140
In a less systemic and more personal response to climbing temperatures, the Vatican's

92
00:05:25,140 --> 00:05:29,920
most famous residents donated 15,000 ice creams to local prisoners during an unpleasant hot

93
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:33,260
snap in a summer that set heat records across the Italian peninsula.

94
00:05:33,620 --> 00:05:37,340
While the gesture was admittedly minor, it signaled the Vatican's dedication to aid

95
00:05:37,340 --> 00:05:39,620
the local population down on its luck.

96
00:05:39,620 --> 00:05:43,500
The Vatican's charity office has also provided free testing and vaccines during the pandemic,

97
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:46,900
and has taken locals experiencing homelessness out for pizza.

98
00:05:46,900 --> 00:05:52,060
In what's been a tough year for a myriad of reasons, Niger made history with its first

99
00:05:52,060 --> 00:05:55,180
ever peaceful, democratic transition of power.

100
00:05:55,180 --> 00:06:00,060
When President Mahamadou Isofu relinquished the position after two terms—the limit outlined

101
00:06:00,060 --> 00:06:05,700
in the country's constitution—Niger elected and placed its new president, Mohamed Bazoum.

102
00:06:05,700 --> 00:06:11,980
While claims of fraud, protest, outright violence, and a stymied coup nearly derailed it, 2021's

103
00:06:11,980 --> 00:06:17,660
successful transition of power was the country's first since it gained independence in 1960.

104
00:06:17,660 --> 00:06:21,740
Just as Niger elected its new leader, the Central African Republic lost one of their

105
00:06:21,740 --> 00:06:22,740
own.

106
00:06:22,740 --> 00:06:26,360
Heavily criticized for the government's inability to foster peace among ethnic groups,

107
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:30,320
its worrying ties with Russia, and its bungled relationship with France, who have now pulled

108
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:34,620
their military aid out of the country, Ferman Nirbada announced that he and his government

109
00:06:34,620 --> 00:06:37,760
had handed over their resignation on Twitter.

110
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:44,160
Just north, in Chad, 2021 saw both the suspension and reinstatement of the Judean football organization

111
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:45,760
by the hands of FIFA.

112
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:49,520
Citing government interference in Chad's effort to seize the association's authority

113
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:54,320
and training grounds, an unsurprising overstep under the ruling military council, soccer's

114
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:57,400
ruling body banned the country from international tournaments.

115
00:06:57,400 --> 00:07:01,960
While restrictions were ultimately lifted, Chad was disqualified from the all-important

116
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:04,840
2021 Africa Cup of Nations.

117
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:09,320
The world's youngest country, South Sudan, rang in its tenth anniversary with a first

118
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:13,360
as the mobile provider Digitel launched in the capital city of Juba.

119
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:17,620
Digitel is the first South Sudanese-owned and operated mobile network, and its stated

120
00:07:17,620 --> 00:07:22,820
goal is to roll out 4G in Juba at competitive rates and provide mobile service for remote

121
00:07:22,820 --> 00:07:27,220
areas—a meaningful step in the country's development.

122
00:07:27,220 --> 00:07:31,220
Important infrastructure developments might be afoot in nearby Burundi as well.

123
00:07:31,220 --> 00:07:35,220
In July, the heads of state from Burundi and the Democratic Republic of the Congo signed

124
00:07:35,220 --> 00:07:39,660
cooperative agreements aimed to foster trade, stamp out rebels, and literally bridge the

125
00:07:39,660 --> 00:07:43,380
Ruzizi river-sized gap between the neighboring countries.

126
00:07:43,380 --> 00:07:47,820
Expanding rail lines and electrification along the borderlands are also key components of

127
00:07:47,820 --> 00:07:49,020
the agreements.

128
00:07:49,020 --> 00:07:54,020
These deals signal on paper what its leaders claim have always connected the two countries—in

129
00:07:54,020 --> 00:07:57,500
their words, a historic brotherhood.

130
00:07:57,500 --> 00:08:01,900
Nonuplets is the crossword-worthy term that reached household-level parlance across Mali

131
00:08:01,900 --> 00:08:03,460
in 2021.

132
00:08:03,460 --> 00:08:08,660
Backed by nationwide well-wishes, 21-year-old Halima Cisse was sent to a specialist in Morocco

133
00:08:08,660 --> 00:08:12,660
in late March to deliver seven babies, or so she thought.

134
00:08:12,660 --> 00:08:17,500
To her doctor's surprise, Cisse harbored nine, all of which were born in good health.

135
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:22,220
Cisse's nonuplets now mark the record for the most babies born at once.

136
00:08:22,220 --> 00:08:27,980
As the world warms, cities are getting hot—sometimes deadly hot.

137
00:08:27,980 --> 00:08:31,340
This is the case in Freetown, the capital city of Sierra Leone.

138
00:08:31,340 --> 00:08:35,780
In the face of deadly heat waves, the city has appointed an extreme heat official to

139
00:08:35,780 --> 00:08:40,340
draft a comprehensive heat strategy, raise general awareness, and create ways to protect

140
00:08:40,340 --> 00:08:41,940
the city's most exposed.

141
00:08:41,940 --> 00:08:46,720
Freetown's extreme heat official is not just the first in Africa, but only the third

142
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:51,760
such official in the world, joining those recently appointed in Miami and Athens.

143
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:53,980
Inspiration takes many forms.

144
00:08:53,980 --> 00:08:59,360
For Burkina Faso nationals, it took the form of the massive, smiling Iron Bibby who set

145
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:01,840
a new world record in loglifting.

146
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:07,040
While Western media might have overlooked his 504-pound over-the-head lift in Glasgow,

147
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:11,800
Scotland, his triumph was big news in Burkina Faso as residents welcomed him back at the

148
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:13,480
airport in droves.

149
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:18,080
The moment wasn't lost on Iron Bibby, who dedicated his trophy to his home country as,

150
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:20,640
quote, a message of hope.

151
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:24,500
On the other side of Africa, in Mozambique, researchers have found that elephants have

152
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:27,680
begun ditching their tusks in the name of survival.

153
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:32,680
Once rare, tuskless African elephants have become increasingly common over the past 50

154
00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:35,520
years—largely on account of poachers.

155
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:39,560
With 90% of the country's elephants killed for their ivory during Mozambique's civil

156
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:44,360
war, tuskless elephants benefited from an increased opportunity to pass down their tuskless

157
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:45,360
genes.

158
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:49,040
With poaching down and conservation up in recent decades, though, it's expected that

159
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:52,000
tusks will come back in vogue.

160
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:55,520
If you're looking for a reminder that the past is very much part of the present, look

161
00:09:55,520 --> 00:09:57,560
no further than Eritrea.

162
00:09:57,560 --> 00:10:02,840
Over 300 Eritreans born during Italy's rule have demanded Italian citizenship.

163
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:07,360
In the seven-odd decades since colonial rule, Eritrean claims to Italian citizenship based

164
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:10,840
on paternal bloodlines have fallen on deaf ears.

165
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:16,160
Racial rules during the fascist period, current Italian immigration policy, lack of documentation,

166
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:21,300
and limited mobility under Eritrea's dictatorial rule have kept an estimated thousands of Eritreans

167
00:10:21,300 --> 00:10:23,700
from accessing Italian citizenship.

168
00:10:23,700 --> 00:10:28,960
The latest push for recognition, though, shows these claims aren't fading quietly.

169
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:33,500
Elegant, meticulously groomed and arranged trees and bushes aren't likely what one

170
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:36,160
would expect along the war-torn streets of Yemen.

171
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:40,420
But that's what you'll run into when passing through the city of Marib, where trees sculpted

172
00:10:40,420 --> 00:10:43,280
into shapes, figures, and animals line roadways.

173
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:47,620
In a region of critical strategic importance, representing one of the government's last

174
00:10:47,620 --> 00:10:53,240
surviving strongholds, this city beautification project, begun in 2016, has offered a welcome

175
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:57,160
respite from the country's dragging civil war.

176
00:10:57,160 --> 00:11:01,820
Dragging also describes the legacy of the West African Ebola outbreak, as the repercussions

177
00:11:01,820 --> 00:11:06,820
of the epidemic that ended in 2016 may still be taking shape.

178
00:11:06,820 --> 00:11:11,060
Researchers suspect that this year's Ebola outbreak of 20-plus probable cases in Guinea

179
00:11:11,060 --> 00:11:14,180
was triggered by a survivor of the earlier outbreak.

180
00:11:14,180 --> 00:11:18,060
While scientists knew that in the rarest of cases the virus could shed and transmit up

181
00:11:18,060 --> 00:11:22,820
to 500 days after infection, the finding that a body harbored the virus for a full five

182
00:11:22,820 --> 00:11:26,380
years was a surprising and frightening development.

183
00:11:26,380 --> 00:11:29,500
$50,000 still goes a long way.

184
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:34,060
In Liberia, $50,000, and doing the right thing with it, will earn you a chance to meet the

185
00:11:34,060 --> 00:11:35,320
president.

186
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:39,960
That was the case for Emmanuel Tullo, a teenage motorcycle taxi driver who found a plastic

187
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:44,300
bag on the side of the road stuffed with 50 grand in cash and returned it in full to the

188
00:11:44,300 --> 00:11:46,220
businesswoman who had lost it.

189
00:11:46,220 --> 00:11:50,460
His good deed was praised by Liberians and earned him the chance to meet the president,

190
00:11:50,460 --> 00:11:54,780
with whom he wanted to discuss getting himself and fellow youngsters back in school.

191
00:11:54,780 --> 00:11:59,580
For the first time, male green sea turtles off the coast of Guinea-Bissau are getting

192
00:11:59,580 --> 00:12:04,860
GPS tags to better understand the endangered species' travel and feeding patterns.

193
00:12:04,860 --> 00:12:09,540
Not only is the attention a boon for the in-trouble turtles, it signals the growing trust between

194
00:12:09,540 --> 00:12:14,120
outside researchers and notoriously protective island residents who have successfully defended

195
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:17,840
and worshipped this sacred environment for centuries.

196
00:12:17,840 --> 00:12:22,240
Researchers have tread lightly and, in turn, benefited mightily from shared local knowledge

197
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:26,320
and expertise to catch and tag the raging reptiles.

198
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:30,140
Finding a middle ground built on trust and respect has also shaped an important development

199
00:12:30,140 --> 00:12:34,200
in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, as calls for the repatriation of artifacts by

200
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:37,800
activists and officials made headway in 2021.

201
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:41,480
In the wake of the global Black Lives Matter movement, the Belgian government released

202
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:46,560
their plan to return all illegitimately procured African artifacts, most of which were stolen

203
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:47,780
from the Congo.

204
00:12:47,780 --> 00:12:52,700
This plan marks the first systematic, government-led effort to return objects stolen during the

205
00:12:52,700 --> 00:12:55,900
country's violent colonization on the continent.

206
00:12:55,900 --> 00:13:01,180
Across several Malawian cities, protesters took to the street bonded by the same plight—data

207
00:13:01,180 --> 00:13:03,800
prices are too darn high.

208
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:09,620
It seems a fair frustration, as one gigabyte costs nearly $28, making it the third most

209
00:13:09,620 --> 00:13:12,940
expensive rate of all UN-recognized countries.

210
00:13:12,940 --> 00:13:16,980
Malawi regulators have expressed their concern over exorbitant rates, as the price has threatened

211
00:13:16,980 --> 00:13:20,020
to slow social economic development.

212
00:13:20,020 --> 00:13:25,200
The stories of two prominent headline-makers collided this year when Tedros Adhanom, director

213
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:30,460
general of the World Health Organization, spoke on the dire situation in North Ethiopia.

214
00:13:30,460 --> 00:13:34,420
In November, the director general said that the Tigray region of Ethiopia was under a

215
00:13:34,420 --> 00:13:38,820
quote, systematic blockade, and that people were dying because of the lack of supplies.

216
00:13:38,820 --> 00:13:42,780
He also noted that Tigrayans were being arrested en masse.

217
00:13:42,780 --> 00:13:47,140
Among Tigray himself, Adhanom never directly assigned blame, as he's worked diligently

218
00:13:47,140 --> 00:13:52,180
to maintain a neutral position on the civil war that has consumed his home country.

219
00:13:52,180 --> 00:13:56,700
As part of their seemingly odd and certainly confusing court case against Myanmar, the

220
00:13:56,700 --> 00:13:59,420
Gambia won an important ruling this year.

221
00:13:59,420 --> 00:14:04,420
On behalf of the Rohingya, a Muslim ethnic group persecuted in Myanmar, the tiny Gambia,

222
00:14:04,420 --> 00:14:09,140
with the backing of the Organization of Islamic Cooperation, a group of 57 nation-states,

223
00:14:09,140 --> 00:14:12,180
filed a lawsuit against Myanmar in 2019.

224
00:14:12,180 --> 00:14:16,220
In September of this year, a judge ordered Facebook to disclose account records pertaining

225
00:14:16,220 --> 00:14:20,520
to the persecution in Myanmar—a big win for the Gambia, as it's widely understood

226
00:14:20,520 --> 00:14:24,580
that social media played a key role in the 2017 genocide.

227
00:14:24,580 --> 00:14:29,020
Sudan's progress towards democratic rule hit a major speed bump this October when the

228
00:14:29,020 --> 00:14:31,060
military seized power.

229
00:14:31,060 --> 00:14:35,740
Since the ousting of Omar al-Bashir in 2019, Sudan has been trending in the democratic

230
00:14:35,740 --> 00:14:39,060
direction—that is, until this most recent coup.

231
00:14:39,060 --> 00:14:43,300
In response to the backslide, thousands of protestors hit the streets in Khartoum while

232
00:14:43,300 --> 00:14:48,060
the US suspended a $700 million dollar aid package meant to aid in the transition towards

233
00:14:48,060 --> 00:14:49,620
civilian governance.

234
00:14:49,620 --> 00:14:53,300
The story is still developing, though, as the US and UN are pressuring the military

235
00:14:53,300 --> 00:14:58,660
to release imprisoned politicians and return a civilian government to power.

236
00:14:58,660 --> 00:15:03,700
Democracy is in trouble in Haiti, too—after a deadly earthquake, a presidential assassination,

237
00:15:03,700 --> 00:15:09,740
and bout after bout of gang violence, chaos and uncertainty are primed to carry into 2022

238
00:15:09,740 --> 00:15:12,980
as general elections have been postponed for the fourth time.

239
00:15:12,980 --> 00:15:17,040
This postponement comes after the Prime Minister decided to dissolve the council responsible

240
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:18,920
for organizing elections.

241
00:15:18,920 --> 00:15:23,960
The PM has said he plans on naming a new council, but is not committed to a timeline—a move

242
00:15:23,960 --> 00:15:27,500
that leaves the spiraling state, well, spiraling.

243
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:31,820
One hundred and thirty young female footballers and their families from Afghanistan can finally

244
00:15:31,820 --> 00:15:33,880
take a deep breath.

245
00:15:33,880 --> 00:15:38,340
Four months after fleeing Kabul as the Taliban closed in, and after stops in Portugal and

246
00:15:38,340 --> 00:15:42,980
Pakistan, the Afghan athletes arrived in London via chartered flight.

247
00:15:42,980 --> 00:15:47,320
Their escape was made possible by a litany of NGOs and philanthropists, one of which was

248
00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:52,580
the chairman of Leeds United—the club where the girls will join the youth team ranks.

249
00:15:52,580 --> 00:15:58,020
2021 was a big year for African astronomy, especially for the Senegalese scientist Maram

250
00:15:58,020 --> 00:16:03,340
Kerry, as the International Astronomical Union retitled the less-than-personable Asteroid

251
00:16:03,340 --> 00:16:06,920
35462 to Maram Kerry—no spaces.

252
00:16:06,920 --> 00:16:11,140
Not only making the asteroid hurtling between Mars and Jupiter more approachable, the renaming

253
00:16:11,140 --> 00:16:15,400
serves as a recognition of the life's work of the director of Africa Space and founding

254
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:20,060
member of the African Astronomical Society, while also shining a light on the nation's

255
00:16:20,060 --> 00:16:21,060
science ambitions.

256
00:16:21,060 --> 00:16:25,260
Senegal doesn't hold a monopoly on Western African ambition, though.

257
00:16:25,260 --> 00:16:29,600
The bureaucrats in Togo took the difficult task of distributing pandemic-related relief

258
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:34,700
funds head-on this year by developing a remarkably efficient digital payout platform.

259
00:16:34,700 --> 00:16:39,420
With only spotty census data and flawed tax records, officials creatively leveraged voter

260
00:16:39,420 --> 00:16:44,540
registration to verify applicants before paying out the aid over SMS—a program that makes

261
00:16:44,540 --> 00:16:47,660
the US's look antiquated by comparison.

262
00:16:47,660 --> 00:16:51,340
The violence that's gripped Ethiopia for the past year has done no favors for East

263
00:16:51,340 --> 00:16:53,280
African neighbors, either.

264
00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:55,780
See the tiny coastal nation of Djibouti.

265
00:16:55,780 --> 00:17:00,500
In July, protesters responding to a state-led attack blocked the rail line that connects

266
00:17:00,500 --> 00:17:02,900
the landlocked Ethiopia to the ocean.

267
00:17:02,900 --> 00:17:08,140
Djibouti's port, through which a whopping 90% of all Ethiopian goods pass, is the country's

268
00:17:08,140 --> 00:17:12,360
key economic driver, and while the rail line's closure wasn't permanent, instability in

269
00:17:12,360 --> 00:17:18,280
Ethiopia has hampered the reliant Djibouti economy to the tune of an estimated $1.7 billion

270
00:17:18,280 --> 00:17:19,540
in lost commerce.

271
00:17:19,540 --> 00:17:23,900
It's been a tough few years for the ski industry, and Lesotho's Afraski Mountain

272
00:17:23,900 --> 00:17:28,340
Resort proved that while unique in terms of its status as one of two resorts in southern

273
00:17:28,340 --> 00:17:31,300
Africa, it wasn't an exception to the struggles.

274
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:36,100
Rather than go under when South African border closures led to a 90% drop in visitors, the

275
00:17:36,100 --> 00:17:40,820
resort adapted, this year offering incentives and reduced rates to get locals on the hill—some

276
00:17:40,820 --> 00:17:45,400
for the very first time—while also finding creative renovation projects to keep its local

277
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:46,940
staff employed.

278
00:17:46,940 --> 00:17:50,460
Chameleons, by their very nature, are hard to spot.

279
00:17:50,460 --> 00:17:53,980
A chameleon measuring just 29 millimeters from tip to tail?

280
00:17:53,980 --> 00:17:54,980
Nearly impossible.

281
00:17:54,980 --> 00:18:00,280
And yet, a group of scientists in northern Madagascar discovered a pair of these nano-chameleons

282
00:18:00,280 --> 00:18:05,820
who are now in the record books as the smallest of the planet's 11,500 reptiles.

283
00:18:05,820 --> 00:18:10,260
Like so much in Madagascar, though, the future of the little lizard is up in the air as habitat

284
00:18:10,260 --> 00:18:14,460
loss has conservationists scrambling to protect the new finding.

285
00:18:14,460 --> 00:18:19,180
From new findings to expensive and rare findings, Petra Diamonds, the British producer of pink

286
00:18:19,180 --> 00:18:24,580
diamonds donned by the Queen herself, has settled to pay 4.3 million pounds to 71 Tanzanian

287
00:18:24,580 --> 00:18:29,040
claimants who've accused the mining company of, among other things, beating, stabbing,

288
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:31,520
and detaining them during their time as miners.

289
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:35,940
While the settlement makes, quote, no admission of liability, Petra has vowed to fund community

290
00:18:35,940 --> 00:18:38,800
projects and prevent future incidents.

291
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:43,900
In the Ivory Coast, stamping out illegal cocoa-grow operations has proved next to impossible,

292
00:18:44,340 --> 00:18:47,700
but that could change with the adoption of the most recent European Commission's plan

293
00:18:47,700 --> 00:18:49,940
to curb global deforestation.

294
00:18:49,940 --> 00:18:54,620
If implemented, this plan would require companies importing cocoa products into the EU to provide

295
00:18:54,620 --> 00:18:58,560
GPS data on the product's origin to ensure it wasn't illegally harvested.

296
00:18:58,560 --> 00:19:02,820
For the Ivory Coast, spreading the responsibility of halting illegal cocoa production will help

297
00:19:02,820 --> 00:19:06,780
protect the meager 15% of its biodiverse forest still standing.

298
00:19:06,780 --> 00:19:11,640
It's been 15 years since Shell's Nigerian subsidiary's pipelines poisoned the farmlands

299
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:16,360
of the villages of Goi and Aruma, and 13 years since the case went to court.

300
00:19:16,360 --> 00:19:21,180
But this year, a Dutch court finally ruled that Royal Dutch Shell and its Nigerian subsidiary

301
00:19:21,180 --> 00:19:25,800
must compensate the villages for a still-undecided amount, and install warning systems along

302
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:28,620
its pipelines to curb the next disaster.

303
00:19:28,620 --> 00:19:32,920
In Rwanda, the crackdown on dissidents under President Paul Kagame's government has extended

304
00:19:32,920 --> 00:19:34,400
to YouTube creators.

305
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:38,560
Judon and Jonsenga, whose channel Ishma TV covers topics such as human rights abuses

306
00:19:38,560 --> 00:19:42,960
and has over 15 million views, was sentenced to seven years in prison after being found

307
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:47,540
guilty of forgery, humiliation of state officials, and two other charges.

308
00:19:47,540 --> 00:19:51,360
He was the second Rwandan YouTube critic to be arrested in a country where freedom of

309
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:54,680
expression is becoming increasingly costly.

310
00:19:54,680 --> 00:19:59,480
Expressing dissent with Uganda's 900-mile, 1,500-kilometer oil pipeline project is becoming

311
00:19:59,480 --> 00:20:00,880
costly too.

312
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:05,320
Citing lack of compensation for land and a host of environmental dangers, local activists

313
00:20:05,320 --> 00:20:09,360
and international NGOs are raising concerns over the project that begins in Murchison

314
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:11,840
National Park and borders Lake Victoria.

315
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:15,680
It seems they're fighting an uphill battle against the project, which is backed by Tanzania,

316
00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:20,840
Uganda, and companies from France and China, as Uganda has arrested six protestors—a

317
00:20:20,840 --> 00:20:23,360
move some see as a scare tactic.

318
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:26,560
Elsewhere on the continent, people's voices are getting through.

319
00:20:26,560 --> 00:20:32,000
In Benin, a law passed that drastically expands access to abortion, and largely puts the decision

320
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,400
in women's hands.

321
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:38,380
What used to be legal only in cases of life-threatening pregnancies, rape, and incestuous relationships

322
00:20:38,380 --> 00:20:43,400
is now allowed on account of a wide range of reasons within the first 12 weeks of pregnancy.

323
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:47,480
Globally, this move has been hailed by women's rights activists, and regionally, this makes

324
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:50,720
Benin the most progressive country on the issue in West Africa.

325
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:55,720
In a country that's 90% Sahara, with only one permanent river, water's hard to come

326
00:20:55,720 --> 00:20:56,720
by.

327
00:20:56,720 --> 00:21:00,800
Facing shortages and inconsistent supply, Mauritania recently launched a fundraising

328
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:06,600
effort to secure $317 million for a project that will provide water to half a million

329
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:08,640
in the south of the arid country.

330
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:12,480
Counting on several financiers from across the Arab world, the project will pipe water

331
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:16,860
to urban and rural users in a bid to minimize the gap between the two and help to realize

332
00:21:16,860 --> 00:21:19,320
the region's agricultural potential.

333
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:23,200
From a country with limited water to one with little land, it's been a momentous year

334
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:27,480
for sports fans on the island of Comoros, as the nation of under a million was ground

335
00:21:27,480 --> 00:21:30,880
zero for a history-making run by the national soccer team.

336
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:35,240
Minnows on the continental level, Comoros held World Cup qualifiers Egypt to a draw

337
00:21:35,240 --> 00:21:39,680
and went unbeaten during the African Cup League of Nations qualifying stage—a Cinderella

338
00:21:39,680 --> 00:21:43,080
run that will see the nation make the cup tournament for the first time.

339
00:21:43,080 --> 00:21:47,200
Not bad for a team that didn't even exist until 2006.

340
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:51,980
As Team Caesars, we don't condone tossing trash into the ocean, but sometimes such littering

341
00:21:51,980 --> 00:21:53,760
lends itself to a story.

342
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:57,940
Picking up plastic along the beaches of Papua New Guinean Island, Steve and Amos stumbled

343
00:21:57,940 --> 00:22:02,760
across a message in the bottle that had traveled 1,500 miles or 2,400 kilometers after being

344
00:22:02,760 --> 00:22:05,480
tossed overboard by an American sailor two years prior.

345
00:22:05,480 --> 00:22:09,760
In a nation struggling with major plastic pollution, perhaps Amos smiled not only at

346
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:13,920
the friendly note, but also at the fact that it was contained in a nice, reusable glass

347
00:22:13,920 --> 00:22:15,200
bottle.

348
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:18,180
How young is too young to charge someone with a crime?

349
00:22:18,180 --> 00:22:21,980
Pakistan faced down this very question when they charged an eight-year-old of blasphemy

350
00:22:21,980 --> 00:22:25,300
when the Hindu child peed in an Islamic school library.

351
00:22:25,300 --> 00:22:29,720
In the incident's wake, police charged the boy while, in reaction to the perceived disrespect,

352
00:22:29,720 --> 00:22:31,820
a mob vandalized a Hindu temple.

353
00:22:31,820 --> 00:22:36,100
Eventually, though, the state stepped in and punished the cops who arrested the child,

354
00:22:36,100 --> 00:22:40,020
dropped all charges, and organized payment for the temple's repairs.

355
00:22:40,020 --> 00:22:43,880
Charges that are sticking, however, were laid against two transgender women who were simply

356
00:22:43,880 --> 00:22:47,740
having dinner in Cameroon when they were arrested for alleged homosexuality.

357
00:22:48,180 --> 00:22:52,460
Later, they were sentenced to five years in jail, which some say is a death sentence in

358
00:22:52,460 --> 00:22:54,540
the male-dominated prison system.

359
00:22:54,540 --> 00:22:58,260
The arrests and high-profile nature of the case, as one of the women is an activist for

360
00:22:58,260 --> 00:23:03,580
trans rights, exemplifies the anti-LGBTQ sentiments and laws that are still common in African

361
00:23:03,580 --> 00:23:07,520
countries, with at least 30 of them criminalizing homosexuality.

362
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:11,380
Technology seems to be a storyline, and this is clearly the case for ISIS-affiliated women

363
00:23:11,380 --> 00:23:16,140
held at the Ahal refugee camp in Syria, where they are marrying men they meet online in

364
00:23:16,140 --> 00:23:20,160
order to receive income and the slim chance of eventual repatriation.

365
00:23:20,160 --> 00:23:24,960
The camp, which is home to nearly 60,000 women and children, is teeming with squalor and

366
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:26,380
extremist ideas.

367
00:23:26,380 --> 00:23:30,220
Yet, jihadist men reportedly see it as a badge of honor to care for the women there

368
00:23:30,220 --> 00:23:35,220
through these virtual marriages, even though they rarely move beyond anything but digital.

369
00:23:35,220 --> 00:23:39,500
For something much more tangible, a Solomon Islands man digging in his backyard to install

370
00:23:39,500 --> 00:23:43,940
a septic system struck something hard, but this was the opposite of treasure.

371
00:23:43,940 --> 00:23:49,220
Instead, he discovered more than 100 unexploded World War II bombs, which came as a real surprise

372
00:23:49,220 --> 00:23:53,640
and a tragic reminder of the devastation the Pacific Islands suffered during that era,

373
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:57,780
when thousands of bombs were dropped and munition stores, like this one, were common.

374
00:23:57,780 --> 00:24:02,780
The ordinances were successfully, and thankfully, removed by a specialist team.

375
00:24:02,780 --> 00:24:08,100
In the opposite of underground, Zimbabwe plans to launch its first satellite, the ZIMSAT-1,

376
00:24:08,100 --> 00:24:09,100
in February.

377
00:24:09,100 --> 00:24:12,840
It will be used to help organizations and officials collect data that relates to ground

378
00:24:12,840 --> 00:24:16,720
cover and drought, as well as transmit signals for amateur radio stations.

379
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:20,920
Zimbabwe's space program has grown quickly in just three years since being established,

380
00:24:20,920 --> 00:24:24,960
and follows on the heels of other African countries extending upward as well.

381
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:29,220
Though many countries focus on the pressing humanitarian needs first, the continent's

382
00:24:29,220 --> 00:24:34,080
satellite fleet now stands at 44 as they increasingly recognize the importance of strategic space

383
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:35,600
investment.

384
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:40,200
Break out those dancing shoes, because the Rumba may officially be a part of worldwide

385
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:42,580
intangible cultural heritage.

386
00:24:42,580 --> 00:24:46,740
The Republic of the Congo and the Democratic Republic of the Congo apply to UNESCO for

387
00:24:46,740 --> 00:24:51,900
the official designation, which would protect the dance's history and cement its importance.

388
00:24:51,900 --> 00:24:56,600
The Rumba was born in 19th century Cuba, combining the drumming of enslaved Africans with the

389
00:24:56,600 --> 00:24:58,180
melodies of Spanish colonizers.

390
00:24:58,180 --> 00:25:02,420
But it's not just of historical importance, because the Rumba has modern-day relevance

391
00:25:02,420 --> 00:25:07,540
too, including the 1960s independence cha-cha—a version of the Rumba that celebrated the freedom

392
00:25:07,540 --> 00:25:09,260
of Belgian Congo.

393
00:25:09,260 --> 00:25:13,300
In the same region, downstream effects from an Angolan diamond mine were catastrophically

394
00:25:13,300 --> 00:25:18,240
felt in a toxic spill that sickened more than 1 million people, killed 12, and decimated

395
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:19,700
fish and wildlife.

396
00:25:19,700 --> 00:25:23,920
Waste from the largest diamond mine in Angola leaked into the Khazai River, which eventually

397
00:25:23,920 --> 00:25:27,900
reached the Congo River, where large amounts of heavy metal were detected.

398
00:25:27,900 --> 00:25:32,180
The mine, which is partially owned by a Russian company, acknowledged there had been a leak,

399
00:25:32,180 --> 00:25:36,260
but said that it was just sand and mud, and of course, they claimed no responsibility

400
00:25:36,260 --> 00:25:37,260
for the disaster.

401
00:25:37,260 --> 00:25:41,080
There's no accountability in this story either, but there is a bit of good news from

402
00:25:41,080 --> 00:25:44,780
a country that's increasingly cracking down on the freedom of the press.

403
00:25:44,780 --> 00:25:48,700
Myanmar released American journalist Danny Fenster from prison just days after he was

404
00:25:48,700 --> 00:25:53,820
sentenced to 11 years for charges that included incitement of violence and visa violations.

405
00:25:53,820 --> 00:25:57,860
The military in Myanmar has clamped down on the media since seizing power in February,

406
00:25:57,860 --> 00:26:01,700
stripping publications of their licenses, and banning outlets from broadcasting.

407
00:26:01,700 --> 00:26:06,660
Fenster, however, was the first foreign journalist to be convicted for charges he says were without

408
00:26:06,660 --> 00:26:12,940
warrant, and thanks to negotiations by a former US ambassador to the UN, now he'll go free.

409
00:26:12,940 --> 00:26:16,740
Imprisonment in an authoritarian country is one person's nightmare, while 10 million

410
00:26:16,740 --> 00:26:21,320
fruit bats descending on a condensed swamp area might sound like another's.

411
00:26:21,320 --> 00:26:24,540
But for conservationists in Zambia, it's essential.

412
00:26:24,540 --> 00:26:28,760
The bats are key to African ecology because they eat fruits and berries and distribute

413
00:26:28,760 --> 00:26:31,080
the seeds during their continental migration.

414
00:26:31,080 --> 00:26:36,180
Now these environmentalists are fighting a proposal for a 17,500-acre or 7,000-hectare

415
00:26:36,180 --> 00:26:40,620
wheat, soy, and corn farm that would be built on the national park's borders and threaten

416
00:26:40,620 --> 00:26:44,340
the bats' habitat, and existence, altogether.

417
00:26:44,340 --> 00:26:49,400
In another story about West African instability, Guinea Junta leader Mamadi Dombuya was sworn

418
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:54,100
in after a successful September coup, marking the fourth coup in the region in the past

419
00:26:54,100 --> 00:26:55,100
year.

420
00:26:55,100 --> 00:26:58,940
Dombuya's party overthrew former president Alpha Conde for what they said would continue

421
00:26:58,940 --> 00:27:03,420
corruption, but political upheaval continues to mire the area, and now Regional Economic

422
00:27:03,420 --> 00:27:08,480
Council has placed economic sanctions and travel restrictions on the Ghanaian junta.

423
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:12,620
Sometimes government overreach isn't always so unpleasant, as is the case with a defanged

424
00:27:12,620 --> 00:27:14,620
and declawed lion named Hima.

425
00:27:14,620 --> 00:27:18,540
He was reunited with his owner after the Cambodian prime minister got involved.

426
00:27:18,540 --> 00:27:22,980
Initially, Hima was seized after TikTok videos of him living casually in a high-end Phnom

427
00:27:22,980 --> 00:27:26,660
Penh neighborhood, something the government deemed inappropriate, went viral.

428
00:27:26,660 --> 00:27:31,180
But additional posts showed a clear bond between the two after their separation, and following

429
00:27:31,180 --> 00:27:36,900
public calls for reunification, the prime minister announced the two would be rejoined.

430
00:27:36,900 --> 00:27:41,900
Speaking of lions, Kenya is known as a wildlife wonderland, but just how many creatures crawl

431
00:27:41,900 --> 00:27:47,380
there was an unknown number until the country completed its first wildlife census this year.

432
00:27:47,380 --> 00:27:52,340
Using planes, drones, helicopters, boats, and 4x4s, researchers tallied the populations

433
00:27:52,340 --> 00:27:57,180
of more than 30 species across nearly 60% of the country to establish a baseline for

434
00:27:57,180 --> 00:28:00,220
one of the world's most unique ecological places.

435
00:28:00,260 --> 00:28:05,300
Using estimates from the past, the numbers of elephants, some 36,280, seem to be going

436
00:28:05,300 --> 00:28:11,820
up, but black rhinos, just 897, have fallen to critically endangered levels.

437
00:28:11,820 --> 00:28:15,980
Kenya counts wildlife, and Nepal counts how many people reached the top of Mount Everest.

438
00:28:15,980 --> 00:28:20,780
Now, they're unhappy with three Indian climbers who allegedly falsified their summit of the

439
00:28:20,780 --> 00:28:23,300
world's highest peak in 2016.

440
00:28:23,300 --> 00:28:27,060
This year, the Nepalese government penalized them by banning them for six years, essentially

441
00:28:27,060 --> 00:28:30,380
preventing them from actually trying to get to the top another time.

442
00:28:30,380 --> 00:28:34,060
The Nepalese ministry verifies climbs through photographic evidence, and while these three

443
00:28:34,060 --> 00:28:38,580
had the photos, presumably photoshopped, they reportedly didn't have enough oxygen to

444
00:28:38,580 --> 00:28:41,260
have feasibly completed the trip.

445
00:28:41,260 --> 00:28:45,940
Back at sea level, impoverished East Timor is at an interesting economic crossroads,

446
00:28:45,940 --> 00:28:50,940
exploring ecotourism, offshore drilling, and now, carbon capture storage as a way to boost

447
00:28:50,940 --> 00:28:52,780
the country's revenue.

448
00:28:52,780 --> 00:28:57,020
Australia has proposed capturing its own carbon waste, and paying to store it in East Timor's

449
00:28:57,020 --> 00:29:01,540
nearly depleted Bayou Undan oil field, which is expected to run out in the next couple

450
00:29:01,540 --> 00:29:02,660
of years.

451
00:29:02,660 --> 00:29:07,280
Proponents see this as a creative environmental solution, and critics say it's simply shifting

452
00:29:07,280 --> 00:29:11,220
climate change responsibility from a rich country to a poor one.

453
00:29:11,220 --> 00:29:15,500
Nearby Vanuatu is a remote Pacific island which has 300,000 residents.

454
00:29:15,500 --> 00:29:20,660
So, why did some 2,000 politicians, business owners, and criminals get citizenship there

455
00:29:20,660 --> 00:29:21,660
recently?

456
00:29:21,660 --> 00:29:24,500
Because for $130,000, they can.

457
00:29:24,500 --> 00:29:29,320
The Citizenship by Investment program is legal, and gives these new residents visa-free access

458
00:29:29,320 --> 00:29:31,980
to the UK and European Union.

459
00:29:31,980 --> 00:29:35,820
But some worry the increased interest in this island, where the passport program accounted

460
00:29:35,820 --> 00:29:41,140
for nearly 42% of government revenue in 2020, might be fertile ground for money laundering

461
00:29:41,140 --> 00:29:42,540
and international mischief.

462
00:29:42,540 --> 00:29:47,980
In a move that signals the increasing geopolitical importance of Africa, Twitter hired its first

463
00:29:47,980 --> 00:29:52,220
employees on the continent in the country of Ghana, where freedom of speech protections

464
00:29:52,220 --> 00:29:55,380
and online freedoms made it an ideal location.

465
00:29:55,380 --> 00:29:59,140
The social media company announced it would fill 11 positions, with plans to officially

466
00:29:59,140 --> 00:30:04,140
open an office there once pandemic restrictions and work-from-home orders are relaxed.

467
00:30:04,140 --> 00:30:09,260
For more than 30 years, Eswatini's King Muswati III has ruled as an absolute monarch

468
00:30:09,260 --> 00:30:12,460
and flaunted a lavish, luxurious lifestyle.

469
00:30:12,460 --> 00:30:13,460
The problem?

470
00:30:13,460 --> 00:30:19,460
60% of the country's 1.1 million residents live in poverty, and they're over his opulence.

471
00:30:19,460 --> 00:30:23,820
For months, residents have participated in pro-democracy protests that have left scores

472
00:30:23,820 --> 00:30:26,180
dead and many more wounded.

473
00:30:26,180 --> 00:30:30,920
Neighboring African countries, including South Africa, upon which Eswatini heavily relies,

474
00:30:30,920 --> 00:30:34,940
are stepping in to help navigate the movement, which many say won't be going away until

475
00:30:34,940 --> 00:30:37,580
there's a brighter future for this developing nation.

476
00:30:37,580 --> 00:30:42,060
A plot to smuggle 55 million methamphetamine tablets and more than 1.5 tons of crystal

477
00:30:42,060 --> 00:30:46,900
meth disguised in beer crates was thwarted by police in Laos, resulting in the largest

478
00:30:46,900 --> 00:30:48,940
single drug seizure in Asia.

479
00:30:48,940 --> 00:30:52,840
They were discovered in a truck in an area called the Golden Triangle—the meeting point

480
00:30:52,840 --> 00:30:58,460
of Myanmar, Laos, and Thailand, which is notorious as a hotspot for drug production and smuggling.

481
00:30:58,460 --> 00:31:02,580
With recent unrest in Myanmar's Shan region and Chinese crackdown on the trade, smugglers

482
00:31:02,580 --> 00:31:07,160
have looked to alternate routes—in this case, without much success.

483
00:31:07,160 --> 00:31:12,100
In another superlative, Pacific Islander Nicole Yamase became the first citizen of the Federated

484
00:31:12,100 --> 00:31:17,020
States of Micronesia to reach Challenger Deep—the deepest part of the Mariana Trench, which lies

485
00:31:17,020 --> 00:31:19,380
within the territorial waters of the country.

486
00:31:19,380 --> 00:31:24,600
Her completion of the 10-hour journey, which took her to 36,000 feet or 11,000 meters below

487
00:31:24,600 --> 00:31:30,020
the ocean's surface, also makes her only the third woman, and at 29, the second youngest,

488
00:31:30,020 --> 00:31:31,020
to ever do it.

489
00:31:31,020 --> 00:31:35,620
She's a PhD student studying climate change's effects on microalgae, and going to the world's

490
00:31:35,620 --> 00:31:38,660
most remote places for research is all in a day's work for her.

491
00:31:38,660 --> 00:31:43,340
On the topic of climate change, in an effort to reduce its dependence on fossil fuels,

492
00:31:43,340 --> 00:31:48,060
Nel Tomé and Principe made an innovative announcement involving deep-water platforms,

493
00:31:48,060 --> 00:31:49,740
but not the oil kind.

494
00:31:49,740 --> 00:31:54,540
Instead, they're engaging in a public-private partnership to debut ocean thermal energy

495
00:31:54,540 --> 00:31:58,520
conversion technology—the first commercial endeavor of its kind.

496
00:31:58,520 --> 00:32:02,660
The floating platforms use the difference between cold deep-ocean water and warm surface

497
00:32:02,660 --> 00:32:06,340
temperatures to create green energy out of the blue.

498
00:32:06,340 --> 00:32:10,820
Another island nation concerned for its future is Kiribati, where six years ago, the government

499
00:32:10,820 --> 00:32:15,500
starred in its own version of House Hunters and purchased some 8.5 square miles or 22

500
00:32:15,500 --> 00:32:19,080
square kilometers of land on Fiji to make sure its potentially displaced residents had

501
00:32:19,080 --> 00:32:21,520
somewhere to go as sea levels rise.

502
00:32:21,520 --> 00:32:25,340
To use that land in the meantime, Kiribati enlisted the help of omnipresent China to

503
00:32:25,340 --> 00:32:29,180
build farms that would provide fresh produce and meat to the island nation, which currently

504
00:32:29,180 --> 00:32:30,900
imports all of its food.

505
00:32:30,900 --> 00:32:35,220
Some say this is another land grab by China, while others see it as a sustainability measure

506
00:32:35,220 --> 00:32:36,660
for Kiribati.

507
00:32:36,660 --> 00:32:40,800
Both of these takes miss what might be the most interesting part of this story—an actual

508
00:32:40,800 --> 00:32:44,400
overseas climate refuge, in the first place.

509
00:32:44,400 --> 00:32:48,640
Garment workers in Bangladesh are more protected after an agreement was signed by some 200

510
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:52,540
international fashion companies that includes legally binding safety commitments, independent

511
00:32:52,540 --> 00:32:57,000
inspections at the factories, and contributions for safety training and factory improvements.

512
00:32:57,000 --> 00:33:01,520
The accord replaces one that was created after a devastating factory fire that killed 1,100

513
00:33:01,520 --> 00:33:04,040
people in 2013 and was set to expire.

514
00:33:04,040 --> 00:33:07,840
Human rights workers praised the move, which means protections will continue into the future

515
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:12,240
and keep Bangladesh as one of the top garment producers in the world.

516
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:16,320
That pandemic coffee habit may be helping boost Honduras' economy, according to recent

517
00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:17,640
economic reports.

518
00:33:17,640 --> 00:33:23,040
GDP growth for 2021 was expected to be between 2 and 5%, but new projections show almost

519
00:33:23,040 --> 00:33:27,180
double that, with the country's economy predicted to grow by almost 9%.

520
00:33:27,180 --> 00:33:31,200
This is thanks to increased activity in retail and manufacturing and, because of supply chain

521
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:35,940
issues, higher prices for coffee, which is one of the country's primary exports.

522
00:33:35,940 --> 00:33:39,900
If two's a party and three's a crowd, then India is taking note.

523
00:33:39,900 --> 00:33:43,820
Some states, including the country's most populous, Uttar Pradesh, which has 240 million

524
00:33:43,820 --> 00:33:48,100
people and would be the world's fifth most populous country by itself, introduced a China-like

525
00:33:48,100 --> 00:33:52,220
two-child policy and sterilization measures to control population growth.

526
00:33:52,220 --> 00:33:55,940
Though it still has to be adopted, the proposal would deny state benefits, subsidies, and

527
00:33:55,940 --> 00:34:00,380
jobs to anyone who has more than two children, and dangles the carrot of incentives for anyone

528
00:34:00,380 --> 00:34:01,620
who gets sterilized.

529
00:34:02,060 --> 00:34:06,140
12 states have already adopted similar measures, all in an effort to limit growth in a country

530
00:34:06,140 --> 00:34:08,900
that's already the second most populous in the world.

531
00:34:08,900 --> 00:34:14,040
In the early 1900s, Namibia was known as German Southwest Africa, and Germany is still dealing

532
00:34:14,040 --> 00:34:18,280
with its dark history there, which included troops that killed, tortured, and forced tens

533
00:34:18,280 --> 00:34:21,520
of thousands of native peoples into the desert to starve.

534
00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:26,200
This year, then-Chancellor Angela Merkel reached a deal that would distribute 1.1 billion euros

535
00:34:26,200 --> 00:34:30,760
over 30 years to benefit aid programs in the African country, but she stopped short of

536
00:34:30,760 --> 00:34:34,700
calling the funding reparations and instead said it was reconciliation money that would

537
00:34:34,700 --> 00:34:38,400
help attempt to quote, heal the wounds of the past.

538
00:34:38,400 --> 00:34:42,780
China continues to expand its presence around the globe, and in Bhutan this hasn't been

539
00:34:42,780 --> 00:34:43,780
subtle.

540
00:34:43,780 --> 00:34:47,020
In the past year, satellite imagery shows that multiple new villages have sprung up

541
00:34:47,020 --> 00:34:51,720
in a 60 square mile or 150 square kilometer Bhutanese area that's been a disputed site

542
00:34:51,720 --> 00:34:55,800
before when India and China went ahead about road construction there a handful of years

543
00:34:55,800 --> 00:34:56,800
ago.

544
00:34:56,800 --> 00:34:59,920
Because of aligned interests when it comes to Chinese overreach, India has supported

545
00:34:59,920 --> 00:35:02,780
Bhutan's claims to the contested territory.

546
00:35:02,780 --> 00:35:06,980
Across the world, the situation in Nicaragua right now is unequivocally bad, and it wasn't

547
00:35:06,980 --> 00:35:11,460
much better in early 2021 when President Daniel Ortega opted to shoot for the moon even though

548
00:35:11,460 --> 00:35:14,140
the nation is mired in social and economic misery.

549
00:35:14,140 --> 00:35:18,220
That's when he established the National Ministry for Extraterrestrial Space Affairs,

550
00:35:18,220 --> 00:35:22,740
the Moon, and other celestial bodies, which people are calling a vanity project.

551
00:35:22,740 --> 00:35:26,380
Its goal is to develop a space agency that will reach the farthest points in the universe,

552
00:35:26,380 --> 00:35:29,540
but quite literally hasn't gotten off the ground.

553
00:35:30,160 --> 00:35:35,680
When one thinks of palm oil plantations, Malaysia and Indonesia usually come to mind, but Guatemala's

554
00:35:35,680 --> 00:35:40,080
emerging market makes it the world's sixth largest producer of palm oil, however that

555
00:35:40,080 --> 00:35:42,900
success, of course, comes at a cost.

556
00:35:42,900 --> 00:35:47,200
More production has led to companies grabbing indigenous lands at an alarming rate.

557
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:51,760
In response, some of Guatemala's indigenous population, almost 40% of the country's

558
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:56,600
17 million residents, are resisting by forcefully moving back onto the land.

559
00:35:56,660 --> 00:36:00,480
The number of baby sea turtle numbers on the 10 island nation of Cape Verde are booming

560
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:01,940
in a rabbit-like way.

561
00:36:01,940 --> 00:36:06,680
The good news is that nest numbers last year were up to 200,000, which is 20 times the

562
00:36:06,680 --> 00:36:08,400
estimates from 2015.

563
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:12,660
The bad news is that sea turtles' gender is determined by the temperature of the sand

564
00:36:12,660 --> 00:36:17,920
where the eggs are laid, and, well, the globally warmed beach means that about 84% of baby

565
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:22,060
sea turtle hatchlings are now female, which unfortunately still keeps that species on

566
00:36:22,060 --> 00:36:23,060
the endangered list.

567
00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:27,160
When it comes to finding fodder for Central Asian's geopolitical cocktail talk, here's

568
00:36:27,160 --> 00:36:31,160
a fun fact—Tajikistan's primary export is migrant labor.

569
00:36:31,160 --> 00:36:36,520
By September 2021, more than 1.6 million Tajiks left the country to work in Russia.

570
00:36:36,520 --> 00:36:40,480
These migrant workers then send billions of dollars in remittances back home.

571
00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:45,640
In 2019, actually, this figure accounted for more than one quarter of Tajikistan's GDP,

572
00:36:45,640 --> 00:36:49,640
making the ex-Soviet country still very dependent on Russia.

573
00:36:49,640 --> 00:36:53,180
Anyone who invested early in Bitcoin should head straight to El Salvador, where they can

574
00:36:53,180 --> 00:36:57,660
make it crypto rain now that the country became the first in the world to adopt the currency

575
00:36:57,660 --> 00:36:58,820
as legal tender.

576
00:36:58,820 --> 00:37:03,060
Though some, including major lender the International Monetary Fund, are skeptical because of the

577
00:37:03,060 --> 00:37:07,460
volatile and risky nature of cryptocurrencies, others are optimistic, such as Salvadorians

578
00:37:07,460 --> 00:37:11,820
who can dip into their Chiva wallet app and find $30 of Bitcoin waiting for them.

579
00:37:11,820 --> 00:37:16,060
In the ongoing fight against ISIS, officials in Iraq declared a moderate victory with the

580
00:37:16,060 --> 00:37:20,600
capture of the Islamic State's finance minister, Sami Jassim Al-Ajuz.

581
00:37:20,600 --> 00:37:24,600
The arrest could provide Iraq and international allies with a treasure trove of intelligence

582
00:37:24,600 --> 00:37:28,520
about the terrorist organization that, although has retreated from daily headlines in recent

583
00:37:28,520 --> 00:37:32,260
years, maintains quite active in sleeper cells throughout the Middle East.

584
00:37:32,260 --> 00:37:35,980
Two residents in Guyana are not staying quiet about protecting the planet, something they

585
00:37:35,980 --> 00:37:39,320
argue is a fundamental right to humanity's sustainability.

586
00:37:39,320 --> 00:37:43,000
The pair is suing their country for having approved oil exploration licenses, saying

587
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:46,240
it violates the government's legal duty to protect the right of future generations

588
00:37:46,240 --> 00:37:47,720
to a healthy environment.

589
00:37:47,720 --> 00:37:51,720
This David versus Goliath fight pits them against ExxonMobil, which is eyeing a potential

590
00:37:51,720 --> 00:37:55,780
8 billion gallons of oil in offshore drilling, which would make it the company's largest

591
00:37:55,780 --> 00:37:57,620
extraction site in the world.

592
00:37:57,620 --> 00:38:02,180
There's nothing like the discovery of 1.3 million year old stone tools to make this

593
00:38:02,180 --> 00:38:05,400
point in time seem, well, short.

594
00:38:05,400 --> 00:38:08,900
Archaeologists in Morocco recently discovered the artifacts in a site associated with human

595
00:38:08,900 --> 00:38:13,140
ancestor Homo erectus, almost doubling the previous start date for the dawn of the stone

596
00:38:13,140 --> 00:38:14,900
tool era in North Africa.

597
00:38:14,900 --> 00:38:19,020
What's mind-boggling is that these tools aren't even close to the oldest traces of

598
00:38:19,020 --> 00:38:23,580
human ancestors, which date all the way back to more than 4 million years ago.

599
00:38:23,580 --> 00:38:28,180
In Kyrgyzstan, Central Asia's only democracy, just over one third of the population turned

600
00:38:28,180 --> 00:38:33,400
out in a snap election that put populist politician and convicted kidnapper Sadr Japarov into

601
00:38:33,400 --> 00:38:34,400
power.

602
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:37,660
The former Soviet country sits between China, which has invested in its infrastructure,

603
00:38:37,660 --> 00:38:41,400
and Russia, to which it still has significant loyalties, including from its newly elected

604
00:38:41,400 --> 00:38:45,240
president who has vowed to remain allied with both neighbors—something that will be tough

605
00:38:45,240 --> 00:38:48,900
to balance amid his own country's partially self-inflicted political turmoil.

606
00:38:48,900 --> 00:38:52,980
There's some positive news about elephants coming out of Gabon, where new research shows

607
00:38:52,980 --> 00:38:57,060
the population of forest elephants, a cousin to the savannah-dwelling pachyderms, seem

608
00:38:57,060 --> 00:38:59,220
to be doing better than expected.

609
00:38:59,220 --> 00:39:02,780
Previous estimates reported there were about 50,000 left in the Central African country,

610
00:39:02,780 --> 00:39:07,380
but a recent study shows that number to be closer to 95,000, thanks to strict anti-poaching

611
00:39:07,420 --> 00:39:10,180
regulations and land conservation measures.

612
00:39:10,180 --> 00:39:14,020
Athleisure-wearing, latte-drinking urbanites might need an extra downward dog and a shot

613
00:39:14,020 --> 00:39:17,740
of espresso to deal with their supply chain woes this year, especially with products like

614
00:39:17,740 --> 00:39:21,860
Lululemon and coffee coming from Vietnam, where a combination of lockdowns and factory

615
00:39:21,860 --> 00:39:26,020
conditions has prompted millions of workers to leave cities and return to their countryside

616
00:39:26,020 --> 00:39:27,020
homes.

617
00:39:27,020 --> 00:39:30,620
Manufacturers are having a tough time luring them back, and that was bad news for a supply

618
00:39:30,620 --> 00:39:32,660
chain already in crisis.

619
00:39:32,660 --> 00:39:36,540
An Arizona man who conducted a years-long human trafficking ring selling babies from

620
00:39:36,540 --> 00:39:40,380
the Marshall Islands to American parents was sentenced to six years in prison and forced

621
00:39:40,380 --> 00:39:43,140
to pay hundreds of thousands in restitution charges.

622
00:39:43,140 --> 00:39:47,380
The man would pay around $10,000 for pregnant Marshallese women to come to the United States

623
00:39:47,380 --> 00:39:51,420
and then arrange for their newborns to be adopted by couples for $40,000.

624
00:39:51,420 --> 00:39:55,320
Officials estimate some 70 adoptions took place this way, taking advantage of the Compact

625
00:39:55,320 --> 00:39:59,960
of Free Association, which allowed them to travel or move to the US without restriction.

626
00:39:59,960 --> 00:40:04,820
On the subject of pregnancy, Polish researchers discovered a first—an Egyptian mummy with

627
00:40:04,820 --> 00:40:05,820
child.

628
00:40:05,820 --> 00:40:09,620
Originally they thought the mummy-mummy was a male priest, but further investigation uncovered

629
00:40:09,620 --> 00:40:14,500
a small femur bone thought to belong to a fetus about 25 to 30 weeks old.

630
00:40:14,500 --> 00:40:17,900
Scientists call the find unique and important to Egyptology, in which little research has

631
00:40:17,900 --> 00:40:19,940
been done on females.

632
00:40:19,940 --> 00:40:24,240
In not-so-sweet news, Ben & Jerry's announced it would stop selling its ice cream in occupied

633
00:40:24,240 --> 00:40:29,180
Palestinian territories, making a very public corporate statement against the Israeli settlements

634
00:40:29,180 --> 00:40:32,140
there, which are not recognized by international law.

635
00:40:32,140 --> 00:40:36,440
Israeli officials called the decision a quote, capitulation to anti-Semitism.

636
00:40:36,440 --> 00:40:39,860
The brand, however, will still be available throughout the internationally recognized

637
00:40:39,860 --> 00:40:42,660
territory of Israel, which sort of makes this ban half-baked.

638
00:40:42,660 --> 00:40:47,340
It's banned for poachers to remove succulents from the desert in South Africa, but that

639
00:40:47,340 --> 00:40:50,860
hasn't stopped it from being an explosive problem in a country that's home to one

640
00:40:50,860 --> 00:40:53,220
third of the world's succulent species.

641
00:40:53,220 --> 00:40:57,360
Specifically, people are harvesting Conophytum, which is a genus of flowering plants that

642
00:40:57,360 --> 00:41:01,140
consists of over 100 species, many of which are on the endangered list.

643
00:41:01,140 --> 00:41:04,840
They're then sold to hot markets including Korea and China, where the plants that were

644
00:41:04,840 --> 00:41:08,980
once considered low-class had become popular for being low-maintenance.

645
00:41:08,980 --> 00:41:12,540
Across the pond, Venezuelans have been fleeing their country in one of the world's largest

646
00:41:12,540 --> 00:41:16,220
human migrations, and one third of them head to neighboring Colombia.

647
00:41:16,220 --> 00:41:19,820
Recently, Colombia announced its decision to provide temporary legal status to more

648
00:41:19,820 --> 00:41:23,460
than 1.7 million migrants who had fled there in recent years.

649
00:41:23,460 --> 00:41:26,260
That means the migrants can work legally for up to ten years.

650
00:41:26,260 --> 00:41:30,560
A collapsed economy has created a humanitarian crisis, and refugees in search of a better

651
00:41:30,560 --> 00:41:34,580
life may find that with Colombia's legal acceptance of them.

652
00:41:34,580 --> 00:41:39,440
Last year, the president of Turkmenistan erected a gilded statue of a beloved breed of dog,

653
00:41:39,440 --> 00:41:40,440
the Alabai.

654
00:41:40,440 --> 00:41:45,600
This year, he took it a step further and announced a national holiday honoring the large, shepherd-like

655
00:41:45,600 --> 00:41:46,600
canine.

656
00:41:46,600 --> 00:41:51,360
This holiday included a contest for the country's best dog, and a medal given to its top border

657
00:41:51,360 --> 00:41:52,360
guard dog.

658
00:41:52,360 --> 00:41:56,860
Alabai now shares the special day with another of Turkmenistan celebrated—the Akhalteki

659
00:41:56,860 --> 00:41:57,860
horse breed.

660
00:41:57,860 --> 00:42:02,180
Both are considered important parts of the national heritage, where herding is a traditional

661
00:42:02,180 --> 00:42:03,180
pastime.

662
00:42:03,180 --> 00:42:07,380
Traditionally, the transfer of power is supposed to be peaceful and seamless.

663
00:42:07,380 --> 00:42:09,060
In Samoa, it wasn't.

664
00:42:09,060 --> 00:42:13,400
Fiamme Naomi Mata'afa finally became the country's prime minister in July, following

665
00:42:13,400 --> 00:42:18,340
several months of constitutional crisis during which her predecessor, Toilepa Salele Malele

666
00:42:18,340 --> 00:42:20,960
Gaiawe, refused to acknowledge her victory.

667
00:42:20,960 --> 00:42:24,700
The former leader had led the country for more than two decades, and would not step

668
00:42:24,700 --> 00:42:25,700
down.

669
00:42:25,700 --> 00:42:29,440
After a series of legal battles and appeals, Mata'afa finally assumed control and is

670
00:42:29,440 --> 00:42:33,160
making history doing it as Samoa's first female prime minister.

671
00:42:33,160 --> 00:42:38,260
In Belize, officials are both making and saving history—ecologically, that is.

672
00:42:38,260 --> 00:42:42,760
This year, a coalition of conservation organizations banded together to save one of the world's

673
00:42:42,760 --> 00:42:48,000
last pristine rainforests, preserving 367 square miles, or 950 square kilometers of

674
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:49,720
land from deforestation.

675
00:42:49,720 --> 00:42:53,920
This area is part of the larger Belize Maya forest, which crosses Mexico, Belize, and

676
00:42:53,920 --> 00:42:58,220
Guatemala, and means a biodiversity hotspot roughly the size of Florida will be saved

677
00:42:58,220 --> 00:42:59,900
in perpetuity.

678
00:42:59,900 --> 00:43:03,820
Something that's not going to last forever is Filipino president Rodrigo Duterte, who

679
00:43:03,820 --> 00:43:07,260
is constitutionally barred from seeking another six-year term.

680
00:43:07,260 --> 00:43:11,260
Ahead of the May elections, those looking to replace him include a potpourri of people,

681
00:43:11,260 --> 00:43:15,020
including his daughter Sara Duterte, son and namesake of the country's former dictator

682
00:43:15,020 --> 00:43:20,420
Ferdinand Bongbong Marcos, former actor and Manila mayor Francisco Domogoso, and newly

683
00:43:20,420 --> 00:43:22,680
retired boxing star Manny Pacquiao.

684
00:43:22,700 --> 00:43:26,380
With candidates expected to perform on stage with the public judging them on their singing

685
00:43:26,380 --> 00:43:30,820
and dancing abilities, the pool is certainly high on the entertainment factor.

686
00:43:30,820 --> 00:43:36,300
To the south, the Indonesian island of Biak is becoming an unexpected player in Elon Musk's

687
00:43:36,300 --> 00:43:37,300
world.

688
00:43:37,300 --> 00:43:40,980
That's because Indonesian president Joko Widodo, as part of his goal to modernize the

689
00:43:40,980 --> 00:43:44,700
nation, personally pitched the tech giant on launching spacecraft from the island that

690
00:43:44,700 --> 00:43:48,060
sits 70 miles or 110 kilometers south of the equator.

691
00:43:48,060 --> 00:43:52,520
Facing displacement, the indigenous population isn't supportive of the proposal.

692
00:43:52,520 --> 00:43:58,120
Musk has also stayed mum on the issue, but we all know his penchant for explosive announcements.

693
00:43:58,120 --> 00:44:02,080
Atmospheric conditions also made headlines in Bolivia, where UV radiation levels in La

694
00:44:02,080 --> 00:44:06,400
Paz hit 21, and that's on a scale that typically tops out at 20.

695
00:44:06,400 --> 00:44:11,360
The Bolivian capital sits at 11,800 feet or 3,600 meters above sea level, and low levels

696
00:44:11,360 --> 00:44:15,560
of clouds caused by climate change combined with a heatwave skyrocketed numbers on the

697
00:44:15,560 --> 00:44:16,560
UV index.

698
00:44:16,560 --> 00:44:20,980
The World Health Organization calls an index of 11 extreme, and 10 minutes exposed at these

699
00:44:20,980 --> 00:44:22,980
levels start to burn the skin.

700
00:44:22,980 --> 00:44:25,840
At 21, people just stay inside.

701
00:44:25,840 --> 00:44:29,760
More than doubling the age of most of her competitors, a 46-year-old gymnast representing

702
00:44:29,760 --> 00:44:33,420
Uzbekistan took her final bow at the Olympics in Tokyo this summer.

703
00:44:33,420 --> 00:44:38,420
It was Oksana Chusovotinya's 8th Olympics—she won the silver medal for vault in 2008 and

704
00:44:38,420 --> 00:44:42,460
capped off with 11 medals won at 17 world championships.

705
00:44:42,460 --> 00:44:46,940
Up next, spending more time with her Olympic wrestling husband and her son, who at 22,

706
00:44:46,940 --> 00:44:49,780
is older than most Olympic gymnasts.

707
00:44:49,780 --> 00:44:53,460
In Libya, there's some frightening news on the artificial intelligence front.

708
00:44:53,460 --> 00:44:57,260
A report commissioned by the United Nations found that a military drone strike used in

709
00:44:57,260 --> 00:45:00,660
the country's civil war may have been carried out autonomously.

710
00:45:00,660 --> 00:45:05,120
Allegedly, militia fighters were hunted down and attacked by a quote, weapon system that

711
00:45:05,120 --> 00:45:06,740
did not require data connectivity.

712
00:45:06,740 --> 00:45:11,620
Though it's implied, the report doesn't go as far as to say the drone acted autonomously.

713
00:45:11,620 --> 00:45:15,920
The vagueness here is de rigueur as the report also doesn't say whether anyone was injured

714
00:45:15,920 --> 00:45:16,920
or killed.

715
00:45:16,920 --> 00:45:20,780
The island nation of Tonga managed to largely avoid the global pandemic, but it's dealing

716
00:45:20,780 --> 00:45:25,460
with its own epidemic now as methamphetamine use has become pervasive and very problematic

717
00:45:25,460 --> 00:45:26,860
in the country of 100,000.

718
00:45:26,860 --> 00:45:30,660
It's so bad that the king made a plea to Tongan parliament asking for help with the

719
00:45:30,660 --> 00:45:35,080
crisis, which is accounting for 60% of admissions to Tonga's mental health wards and filling

720
00:45:35,080 --> 00:45:36,420
up local prisons.

721
00:45:36,420 --> 00:45:40,260
Tonga has long been a stop on the drug route from Asia to New Zealand and Australia—this

722
00:45:40,260 --> 00:45:44,340
just means that the drugs are increasingly stopping instead of passing through.

723
00:45:44,340 --> 00:45:46,820
Something else that's stopping is the Piranha River.

724
00:45:46,820 --> 00:45:51,300
South America's second largest river straddles Paraguay, Argentina, and Brazil, and sadly,

725
00:45:51,300 --> 00:45:54,620
it's the lowest it's been in more than 70 years.

726
00:45:54,620 --> 00:45:58,580
Scientists say deforestation in the Amazon is to blame, as rainfall, much of which emanates

727
00:45:58,580 --> 00:46:01,520
from the forest itself, has significantly decreased.

728
00:46:01,520 --> 00:46:06,100
As a result, the river is 10.5 feet or 3 meters lower than normal, and threatening the lives

729
00:46:06,100 --> 00:46:10,660
and businesses of people who populate more than 60 towns along its shores.

730
00:46:10,660 --> 00:46:14,660
Also threatening was two men's plot to unseat Jordan's King Abdullah, a crime for which

731
00:46:14,660 --> 00:46:17,240
they were sentenced to 15 years in prison.

732
00:46:17,240 --> 00:46:20,660
They were aides to the king's half-brother, who was removed from the line of succession

733
00:46:20,660 --> 00:46:21,660
in 2004.

734
00:46:21,660 --> 00:46:26,120
But not to be deterred, his plan using these proxies included rallying civilian support

735
00:46:26,120 --> 00:46:27,460
to oust Abdullah.

736
00:46:27,460 --> 00:46:28,460
The twist?

737
00:46:28,460 --> 00:46:32,460
Some say all three may have been unknowingly backed by the Trump administration, who saw

738
00:46:32,460 --> 00:46:36,640
Abdullah as an obstacle in securing an Israeli-Palestinian peace treaty.

739
00:46:36,640 --> 00:46:40,900
The king, however, will remain in power, and these two will go to jail.

740
00:46:40,900 --> 00:46:45,500
When an immigrant commits a crime in the United Kingdom, they get deported, often by airplane.

741
00:46:45,500 --> 00:46:49,340
Lately, however, the loads have been light with just four people sent back to Jamaica

742
00:46:49,340 --> 00:46:53,700
on a recent 350-passenger Airbus A350-900 flight.

743
00:46:53,700 --> 00:46:58,460
That evens out to about $66,000 or 50,000 pounds per person.

744
00:46:58,460 --> 00:47:02,260
These cost happy people wondering about the viability of such an expensive program, while

745
00:47:02,260 --> 00:47:06,380
others say it's critical to get convicted criminals out of the country.

746
00:47:06,380 --> 00:47:10,700
Finds that will happily be sent overseas includes two of the world's largest diamonds unearthed

747
00:47:10,700 --> 00:47:17,340
this year in Botswana—a 1,174-carat and 1,098-carat diamond were both discovered weeks

748
00:47:17,340 --> 00:47:21,420
apart in the country's mines, which are some of the top-producing in the world.

749
00:47:21,420 --> 00:47:25,020
Each diamond is about the size of someone's hand, and they come at an important time for

750
00:47:25,020 --> 00:47:29,140
the market, which is trying to rebound after the pandemic—bright news for the country

751
00:47:29,140 --> 00:47:31,200
and the soon-to-be betrothed.

752
00:47:31,200 --> 00:47:34,760
Later unearthing took place in Mongolia, where archaeologists were able to use a new

753
00:47:34,760 --> 00:47:39,360
technology to look below ground and map the ancient city of Karakorum, the capital of

754
00:47:39,360 --> 00:47:43,040
the Mongolian Empire, established by Genghis Khan in the 1200s.

755
00:47:43,040 --> 00:47:47,240
Using magnetic fields to determine the footprint's layout and structural composition, the researchers

756
00:47:47,240 --> 00:47:51,480
determined, among other things, that the city was only at about 40% capacity—likely home

757
00:47:51,480 --> 00:47:55,960
to laborers and craftspeople—while the majority lived a more nomadic lifestyle.

758
00:47:55,960 --> 00:47:57,440
And that brings us to halfway.

759
00:47:57,440 --> 00:48:01,480
We'll plow through the remaining 98 entries on Friday when part two is released, but you

760
00:48:01,480 --> 00:48:05,480
don't have to wait until then, or sit through ads for that matter, if you sign up for Nebula

761
00:48:05,480 --> 00:48:06,480
today.

762
00:48:06,480 --> 00:48:09,520
The streaming platform was made by creators like me and my friends from Real Science,

763
00:48:09,520 --> 00:48:11,720
Medlife Crisis, Real Life Lore, and more.

764
00:48:11,720 --> 00:48:15,640
We all wanted to focus on content, and not stress about demonetization and algorithms,

765
00:48:15,640 --> 00:48:17,500
so we made our own streaming site.

766
00:48:17,500 --> 00:48:21,460
On Nebula, you can watch dozens of your favorite educational creators' normal videos early

767

and ad-free, occasional extended cuts and companion videos, and big-budget Nebula originals.

768
00:48:26,400 --> 00:48:30,080
Of course, we still want you all to be able to watch our stuff easily, so we're partnering

769
00:48:30,080 --> 00:48:33,800

776
00:48:55,640 --> 00:49:00,040
how about you try watching CuriosityStream's original documentary about how the groundbreaking,
