0	3480	2021 was not a fresh start.
3480	7760	A sampling of newspapers' front pages, a stroll through single-digit cable channels,
7760	11920	a scroll through your trusted news sites, all advance the same sentiment.
11920	17280	A new year doesn't mean a new world, a fresh fourth digit doesn't refresh the headlines.
17280	22520	Rather, 2021 was a year of news stories evolving, of headlines maturing.
22520	26220	Pandemic stories went from panic and uncertainty over the virus to panic and uncertainty over
26220	28360	the vaccine and its rollout.
28800	32280	Stories on paper product shortages turned into headlines outlining outright supply chain
32280	36920	chaos—coverage of police violence, racial injustice, and subsequent protests moved from
36920	38760	the streets and into the courtroom.
38760	42680	The strongest point of continuity from last year to this year, however, was that a host
42680	47240	of stories burnt so bright that they left little oxygen for smaller ones to breathe.
47240	48820	So, we did it again.
48820	54120	We assembled a list of news stories, one for each country, that you likely missed in 2021.
54120	55680	Some rules are the same from last year.
55680	59380	We're not covering the big stories—you won't hear about America ending its longest
59380	63720	war, the traffic jam in the Suez Canal, and you certainly won't hear me utter the all-consuming
63720	64720	C-word.
64720	69280	In its absence, you'll notice that two other C-words came to dominate our headlines—climate
69280	71160	change and coup d'etat.
71160	73720	These themes point to the change in this year's video.
73720	77700	Rather than focusing on finding stories distant from the C-word, this edition's headlines
77700	81760	reflect the experience of each country's general populace—stories that often revolve
81760	86440	around responses to a rapidly changing world and unnervingly unstable governments.
86440	90440	The stories aren't all dark, though—2021 was tough, but it was one filled with the
90440	92680	heartening and, of course, the quirky.
92680	96840	Not only does this people-first focus inform the stories we chose, but also how we organize
96840	98800	the stories themselves.
98800	102680	Rather than going from most populous to least like last year, we're using the Human Development
102680	104080	Index, or HDI.
104080	108600	HDI is a metric aimed to quantify standard of living, ranking each country between zero
108600	113480	and one based on three dimensions—a long and happy life, accumulation of education,
113480	114480	and earnings.
114480	117960	The United Nations compiles this list using an algorithm that includes indicators such
117960	122240	as life expectancy at birth, gross national income per capita, and mean years of schooling
122240	124240	for adults 25 and over.
124240	128820	HDI was created to, as the UN states, quote, emphasize that people and their capability
128820	132880	should be the ultimate criteria for assessing the development of a country, not economic
132880	133880	growth alone.
133880	138460	Put simply, HDI is the best metric available to frame this trip around the globe from the
138460	143940	perspective of everyday people, but not all of the 196 UN-recognized countries and territories
143940	146420	we cover have an HDI score.
146420	150620	Missing statistics in per capita income, life expectancy, or years of education means that
150620	154340	seven countries didn't have a score, but they did make news, so we'll start there
154340	156940	and then go from lowest HDI to highest.
156940	160580	We've spent a lot of time explaining, but you're here for the headlines, so let's
160580	163340	get started with the first 98.
163340	168220	We start this year in the country that the HDI calculators probably know the least about—North
168220	169220	Korea.
169220	173020	The Hermit Kingdom countered its natural disposition when it decided to reopen lines of communication
173020	176860	with South Korea via the hotline that directly connects Seoul and Pyongyang.
176860	180860	The hotlines existed in one form or another since the 1970s, but has been severed twice
180860	184980	in the past two years on account of the failed Trump Summit with the North, and joint military
184980	187620	exercises between the US and the South.
187620	191680	From nations we'd like to know more about, to continents that spark curiosity, Venturi,
191680	195740	an innovative auto company and formerly E-team from Monaco, announced its plan to launch
195740	198300	its electric polar exploration vehicle in Antarctica.
198300	201420	While the world's been sending vehicles down there for decades, Venturi's will be
201420	205580	the first that spews zero emissions as it transports scientists across the continent
205580	207700	to conduct important climate change research.
207700	211700	While it's been tested on French ski resorts, the sole focus has been getting the vehicle
211700	216200	ready for the southern continent—a mission laid bare by the vehicle's name, Antarctica.
216200	220860	The news out of Nauru suggested that 2021 wasn't one to critically rethink its international
220860	224660	agreements, but a chance to double down—at least that was the case when the country renewed
224660	229140	its deal with Australia to serve as an offshore processing location for asylum seekers looking
229140	231180	to enter the popular migration destination.
231180	235020	While the extension keeps the island nation in the good graces of regional power broker
235020	239460	Australia, it keeps the island connected to and complicit in an asylum system that many,
239460	244420	including the UN, has decried as cruel and inhuman with its delays, decrepit living conditions,
244420	245980	and reports of abuse.
245980	250900	2021 was an Olympics year, and one of the smallest countries in the world took two podiums—San
250900	255880	Marino, a 23-square-mile, 60-square-kilometer enclave surrounded by Italy, earned its first
255880	256880	Olympic medal.
256880	260700	Women's trap shooter Alessandra Parilli took home a bronze during the Summer Games,
260700	265700	but it wasn't just her award—now the country, with 33,000 people, came in first for being
265700	270300	the least populated territory in the world to earn an Olympic medal, surpassing Bermuda's
270300	271300	70,000.
271300	275140	Somalia got its first taste of the silver screen in 30 years when the National Theatre
275140	279580	of Somalia reopened for screening featuring two short films by a homegrown director.
279580	283740	The theatre closed in 1991 at the start of the country's civil war, has been used frequently
283740	288380	by warlords as their headquarters, and was then bombed by anti-entertainment jihadists.
288380	293980	Its reopening, though tenuous and under heavy security, marked a flicker of hope for civilians—especially
293980	294980	the flick-loving ones.
294980	298540	And we're not even into the list, but we're already at climate change.
298540	302920	Tuvalu's foreign minister went viral for addressing the COP26 climate summit knee-deep
302920	306700	in water—a strong image that demonstrates the peril facing the island nation, which
306700	309980	only rises to 15 feet or 4.5 meters above sea level.
309980	314100	He's asking that if the nation goes underwater, it can retain ownership to its maritime zones
314100	318540	and rights as a state even if residents have to relocate—existential questions for a
318540	321340	very non-existential crisis.
321340	325140	In a less systemic and more personal response to climbing temperatures, the Vatican's
325140	329920	most famous residents donated 15,000 ice creams to local prisoners during an unpleasant hot
329920	333260	snap in a summer that set heat records across the Italian peninsula.
333620	337340	While the gesture was admittedly minor, it signaled the Vatican's dedication to aid
337340	339620	the local population down on its luck.
339620	343500	The Vatican's charity office has also provided free testing and vaccines during the pandemic,
343500	346900	and has taken locals experiencing homelessness out for pizza.
346900	352060	In what's been a tough year for a myriad of reasons, Niger made history with its first
352060	355180	ever peaceful, democratic transition of power.
355180	360060	When President Mahamadou Isofu relinquished the position after two terms—the limit outlined
360060	365700	in the country's constitution—Niger elected and placed its new president, Mohamed Bazoum.
365700	371980	While claims of fraud, protest, outright violence, and a stymied coup nearly derailed it, 2021's
371980	377660	successful transition of power was the country's first since it gained independence in 1960.
377660	381740	Just as Niger elected its new leader, the Central African Republic lost one of their
381740	382740	own.
382740	386360	Heavily criticized for the government's inability to foster peace among ethnic groups,
386360	390320	its worrying ties with Russia, and its bungled relationship with France, who have now pulled
390320	394620	their military aid out of the country, Ferman Nirbada announced that he and his government
394620	397760	had handed over their resignation on Twitter.
397760	404160	Just north, in Chad, 2021 saw both the suspension and reinstatement of the Judean football organization
404160	405760	by the hands of FIFA.
405760	409520	Citing government interference in Chad's effort to seize the association's authority
409520	414320	and training grounds, an unsurprising overstep under the ruling military council, soccer's
414320	417400	ruling body banned the country from international tournaments.
417400	421960	While restrictions were ultimately lifted, Chad was disqualified from the all-important
421960	424840	2021 Africa Cup of Nations.
424840	429320	The world's youngest country, South Sudan, rang in its tenth anniversary with a first
429320	433360	as the mobile provider Digitel launched in the capital city of Juba.
433360	437620	Digitel is the first South Sudanese-owned and operated mobile network, and its stated
437620	442820	goal is to roll out 4G in Juba at competitive rates and provide mobile service for remote
442820	447220	areas—a meaningful step in the country's development.
447220	451220	Important infrastructure developments might be afoot in nearby Burundi as well.
451220	455220	In July, the heads of state from Burundi and the Democratic Republic of the Congo signed
455220	459660	cooperative agreements aimed to foster trade, stamp out rebels, and literally bridge the
459660	463380	Ruzizi river-sized gap between the neighboring countries.
463380	467820	Expanding rail lines and electrification along the borderlands are also key components of
467820	469020	the agreements.
469020	474020	These deals signal on paper what its leaders claim have always connected the two countries—in
474020	477500	their words, a historic brotherhood.
477500	481900	Nonuplets is the crossword-worthy term that reached household-level parlance across Mali
481900	483460	in 2021.
483460	488660	Backed by nationwide well-wishes, 21-year-old Halima Cisse was sent to a specialist in Morocco
488660	492660	in late March to deliver seven babies, or so she thought.
492660	497500	To her doctor's surprise, Cisse harbored nine, all of which were born in good health.
497500	502220	Cisse's nonuplets now mark the record for the most babies born at once.
502220	507980	As the world warms, cities are getting hot—sometimes deadly hot.
507980	511340	This is the case in Freetown, the capital city of Sierra Leone.
511340	515780	In the face of deadly heat waves, the city has appointed an extreme heat official to
515780	520340	draft a comprehensive heat strategy, raise general awareness, and create ways to protect
520340	521940	the city's most exposed.
521940	526720	Freetown's extreme heat official is not just the first in Africa, but only the third
526720	531760	such official in the world, joining those recently appointed in Miami and Athens.
531760	533980	Inspiration takes many forms.
533980	539360	For Burkina Faso nationals, it took the form of the massive, smiling Iron Bibby who set
539360	541840	a new world record in loglifting.
541840	547040	While Western media might have overlooked his 504-pound over-the-head lift in Glasgow,
547040	551800	Scotland, his triumph was big news in Burkina Faso as residents welcomed him back at the
551800	553480	airport in droves.
553480	558080	The moment wasn't lost on Iron Bibby, who dedicated his trophy to his home country as,
558080	560640	quote, a message of hope.
560640	564500	On the other side of Africa, in Mozambique, researchers have found that elephants have
564500	567680	begun ditching their tusks in the name of survival.
567680	572680	Once rare, tuskless African elephants have become increasingly common over the past 50
572680	575520	years—largely on account of poachers.
575520	579560	With 90% of the country's elephants killed for their ivory during Mozambique's civil
579560	584360	war, tuskless elephants benefited from an increased opportunity to pass down their tuskless
584360	585360	genes.
585360	589040	With poaching down and conservation up in recent decades, though, it's expected that
589040	592000	tusks will come back in vogue.
592000	595520	If you're looking for a reminder that the past is very much part of the present, look
595520	597560	no further than Eritrea.
597560	602840	Over 300 Eritreans born during Italy's rule have demanded Italian citizenship.
602840	607360	In the seven-odd decades since colonial rule, Eritrean claims to Italian citizenship based
607360	610840	on paternal bloodlines have fallen on deaf ears.
610840	616160	Racial rules during the fascist period, current Italian immigration policy, lack of documentation,
616160	621300	and limited mobility under Eritrea's dictatorial rule have kept an estimated thousands of Eritreans
621300	623700	from accessing Italian citizenship.
623700	628960	The latest push for recognition, though, shows these claims aren't fading quietly.
628960	633500	Elegant, meticulously groomed and arranged trees and bushes aren't likely what one
633500	636160	would expect along the war-torn streets of Yemen.
636160	640420	But that's what you'll run into when passing through the city of Marib, where trees sculpted
640420	643280	into shapes, figures, and animals line roadways.
643280	647620	In a region of critical strategic importance, representing one of the government's last
647620	653240	surviving strongholds, this city beautification project, begun in 2016, has offered a welcome
653240	657160	respite from the country's dragging civil war.
657160	661820	Dragging also describes the legacy of the West African Ebola outbreak, as the repercussions
661820	666820	of the epidemic that ended in 2016 may still be taking shape.
666820	671060	Researchers suspect that this year's Ebola outbreak of 20-plus probable cases in Guinea
671060	674180	was triggered by a survivor of the earlier outbreak.
674180	678060	While scientists knew that in the rarest of cases the virus could shed and transmit up
678060	682820	to 500 days after infection, the finding that a body harbored the virus for a full five
682820	686380	years was a surprising and frightening development.
686380	689500	$50,000 still goes a long way.
689500	694060	In Liberia, $50,000, and doing the right thing with it, will earn you a chance to meet the
694060	695320	president.
695320	699960	That was the case for Emmanuel Tullo, a teenage motorcycle taxi driver who found a plastic
699960	704300	bag on the side of the road stuffed with 50 grand in cash and returned it in full to the
704300	706220	businesswoman who had lost it.
706220	710460	His good deed was praised by Liberians and earned him the chance to meet the president,
710460	714780	with whom he wanted to discuss getting himself and fellow youngsters back in school.
714780	719580	For the first time, male green sea turtles off the coast of Guinea-Bissau are getting
719580	724860	GPS tags to better understand the endangered species' travel and feeding patterns.
724860	729540	Not only is the attention a boon for the in-trouble turtles, it signals the growing trust between
729540	734120	outside researchers and notoriously protective island residents who have successfully defended
734120	737840	and worshipped this sacred environment for centuries.
737840	742240	Researchers have tread lightly and, in turn, benefited mightily from shared local knowledge
742240	746320	and expertise to catch and tag the raging reptiles.
746320	750140	Finding a middle ground built on trust and respect has also shaped an important development
750140	754200	in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, as calls for the repatriation of artifacts by
754200	757800	activists and officials made headway in 2021.
757800	761480	In the wake of the global Black Lives Matter movement, the Belgian government released
761480	766560	their plan to return all illegitimately procured African artifacts, most of which were stolen
766560	767780	from the Congo.
767780	772700	This plan marks the first systematic, government-led effort to return objects stolen during the
772700	775900	country's violent colonization on the continent.
775900	781180	Across several Malawian cities, protesters took to the street bonded by the same plight—data
781180	783800	prices are too darn high.
783800	789620	It seems a fair frustration, as one gigabyte costs nearly $28, making it the third most
789620	792940	expensive rate of all UN-recognized countries.
792940	796980	Malawi regulators have expressed their concern over exorbitant rates, as the price has threatened
796980	800020	to slow social economic development.
800020	805200	The stories of two prominent headline-makers collided this year when Tedros Adhanom, director
805200	810460	general of the World Health Organization, spoke on the dire situation in North Ethiopia.
810460	814420	In November, the director general said that the Tigray region of Ethiopia was under a
814420	818820	quote, systematic blockade, and that people were dying because of the lack of supplies.
818820	822780	He also noted that Tigrayans were being arrested en masse.
822780	827140	Among Tigray himself, Adhanom never directly assigned blame, as he's worked diligently
827140	832180	to maintain a neutral position on the civil war that has consumed his home country.
832180	836700	As part of their seemingly odd and certainly confusing court case against Myanmar, the
836700	839420	Gambia won an important ruling this year.
839420	844420	On behalf of the Rohingya, a Muslim ethnic group persecuted in Myanmar, the tiny Gambia,
844420	849140	with the backing of the Organization of Islamic Cooperation, a group of 57 nation-states,
849140	852180	filed a lawsuit against Myanmar in 2019.
852180	856220	In September of this year, a judge ordered Facebook to disclose account records pertaining
856220	860520	to the persecution in Myanmar—a big win for the Gambia, as it's widely understood
860520	864580	that social media played a key role in the 2017 genocide.
864580	869020	Sudan's progress towards democratic rule hit a major speed bump this October when the
869020	871060	military seized power.
871060	875740	Since the ousting of Omar al-Bashir in 2019, Sudan has been trending in the democratic
875740	879060	direction—that is, until this most recent coup.
879060	883300	In response to the backslide, thousands of protestors hit the streets in Khartoum while
883300	888060	the US suspended a $700 million dollar aid package meant to aid in the transition towards
888060	889620	civilian governance.
889620	893300	The story is still developing, though, as the US and UN are pressuring the military
893300	898660	to release imprisoned politicians and return a civilian government to power.
898660	903700	Democracy is in trouble in Haiti, too—after a deadly earthquake, a presidential assassination,
903700	909740	and bout after bout of gang violence, chaos and uncertainty are primed to carry into 2022
909740	912980	as general elections have been postponed for the fourth time.
912980	917040	This postponement comes after the Prime Minister decided to dissolve the council responsible
917040	918920	for organizing elections.
918920	923960	The PM has said he plans on naming a new council, but is not committed to a timeline—a move
923960	927500	that leaves the spiraling state, well, spiraling.
927500	931820	One hundred and thirty young female footballers and their families from Afghanistan can finally
931820	933880	take a deep breath.
933880	938340	Four months after fleeing Kabul as the Taliban closed in, and after stops in Portugal and
938340	942980	Pakistan, the Afghan athletes arrived in London via chartered flight.
942980	947320	Their escape was made possible by a litany of NGOs and philanthropists, one of which was
947320	952580	the chairman of Leeds United—the club where the girls will join the youth team ranks.
952580	958020	2021 was a big year for African astronomy, especially for the Senegalese scientist Maram
958020	963340	Kerry, as the International Astronomical Union retitled the less-than-personable Asteroid
963340	966920	35462 to Maram Kerry—no spaces.
966920	971140	Not only making the asteroid hurtling between Mars and Jupiter more approachable, the renaming
971140	975400	serves as a recognition of the life's work of the director of Africa Space and founding
975400	980060	member of the African Astronomical Society, while also shining a light on the nation's
980060	981060	science ambitions.
981060	985260	Senegal doesn't hold a monopoly on Western African ambition, though.
985260	989600	The bureaucrats in Togo took the difficult task of distributing pandemic-related relief
989600	994700	funds head-on this year by developing a remarkably efficient digital payout platform.
994700	999420	With only spotty census data and flawed tax records, officials creatively leveraged voter
999420	1004540	registration to verify applicants before paying out the aid over SMS—a program that makes
1004540	1007660	the US's look antiquated by comparison.
1007660	1011340	The violence that's gripped Ethiopia for the past year has done no favors for East
1011340	1013280	African neighbors, either.
1013280	1015780	See the tiny coastal nation of Djibouti.
1015780	1020500	In July, protesters responding to a state-led attack blocked the rail line that connects
1020500	1022900	the landlocked Ethiopia to the ocean.
1022900	1028140	Djibouti's port, through which a whopping 90% of all Ethiopian goods pass, is the country's
1028140	1032360	key economic driver, and while the rail line's closure wasn't permanent, instability in
1032360	1038280	Ethiopia has hampered the reliant Djibouti economy to the tune of an estimated $1.7 billion
1038280	1039540	in lost commerce.
1039540	1043900	It's been a tough few years for the ski industry, and Lesotho's Afraski Mountain
1043900	1048340	Resort proved that while unique in terms of its status as one of two resorts in southern
1048340	1051300	Africa, it wasn't an exception to the struggles.
1051300	1056100	Rather than go under when South African border closures led to a 90% drop in visitors, the
1056100	1060820	resort adapted, this year offering incentives and reduced rates to get locals on the hill—some
1060820	1065400	for the very first time—while also finding creative renovation projects to keep its local
1065400	1066940	staff employed.
1066940	1070460	Chameleons, by their very nature, are hard to spot.
1070460	1073980	A chameleon measuring just 29 millimeters from tip to tail?
1073980	1074980	Nearly impossible.
1074980	1080280	And yet, a group of scientists in northern Madagascar discovered a pair of these nano-chameleons
1080280	1085820	who are now in the record books as the smallest of the planet's 11,500 reptiles.
1085820	1090260	Like so much in Madagascar, though, the future of the little lizard is up in the air as habitat
1090260	1094460	loss has conservationists scrambling to protect the new finding.
1094460	1099180	From new findings to expensive and rare findings, Petra Diamonds, the British producer of pink
1099180	1104580	diamonds donned by the Queen herself, has settled to pay 4.3 million pounds to 71 Tanzanian
1104580	1109040	claimants who've accused the mining company of, among other things, beating, stabbing,
1109040	1111520	and detaining them during their time as miners.
1111520	1115940	While the settlement makes, quote, no admission of liability, Petra has vowed to fund community
1115940	1118800	projects and prevent future incidents.
1118800	1123900	In the Ivory Coast, stamping out illegal cocoa-grow operations has proved next to impossible,
1124340	1127700	but that could change with the adoption of the most recent European Commission's plan
1127700	1129940	to curb global deforestation.
1129940	1134620	If implemented, this plan would require companies importing cocoa products into the EU to provide
1134620	1138560	GPS data on the product's origin to ensure it wasn't illegally harvested.
1138560	1142820	For the Ivory Coast, spreading the responsibility of halting illegal cocoa production will help
1142820	1146780	protect the meager 15% of its biodiverse forest still standing.
1146780	1151640	It's been 15 years since Shell's Nigerian subsidiary's pipelines poisoned the farmlands
1151640	1156360	of the villages of Goi and Aruma, and 13 years since the case went to court.
1156360	1161180	But this year, a Dutch court finally ruled that Royal Dutch Shell and its Nigerian subsidiary
1161180	1165800	must compensate the villages for a still-undecided amount, and install warning systems along
1165800	1168620	its pipelines to curb the next disaster.
1168620	1172920	In Rwanda, the crackdown on dissidents under President Paul Kagame's government has extended
1172920	1174400	to YouTube creators.
1174400	1178560	Judon and Jonsenga, whose channel Ishma TV covers topics such as human rights abuses
1178560	1182960	and has over 15 million views, was sentenced to seven years in prison after being found
1182960	1187540	guilty of forgery, humiliation of state officials, and two other charges.
1187540	1191360	He was the second Rwandan YouTube critic to be arrested in a country where freedom of
1191360	1194680	expression is becoming increasingly costly.
1194680	1199480	Expressing dissent with Uganda's 900-mile, 1,500-kilometer oil pipeline project is becoming
1199480	1200880	costly too.
1200880	1205320	Citing lack of compensation for land and a host of environmental dangers, local activists
1205320	1209360	and international NGOs are raising concerns over the project that begins in Murchison
1209360	1211840	National Park and borders Lake Victoria.
1211840	1215680	It seems they're fighting an uphill battle against the project, which is backed by Tanzania,
1215680	1220840	Uganda, and companies from France and China, as Uganda has arrested six protestors—a
1220840	1223360	move some see as a scare tactic.
1223360	1226560	Elsewhere on the continent, people's voices are getting through.
1226560	1232000	In Benin, a law passed that drastically expands access to abortion, and largely puts the decision
1232000	1233400	in women's hands.
1233400	1238380	What used to be legal only in cases of life-threatening pregnancies, rape, and incestuous relationships
1238380	1243400	is now allowed on account of a wide range of reasons within the first 12 weeks of pregnancy.
1243400	1247480	Globally, this move has been hailed by women's rights activists, and regionally, this makes
1247480	1250720	Benin the most progressive country on the issue in West Africa.
1250720	1255720	In a country that's 90% Sahara, with only one permanent river, water's hard to come
1255720	1256720	by.
1256720	1260800	Facing shortages and inconsistent supply, Mauritania recently launched a fundraising
1260800	1266600	effort to secure $317 million for a project that will provide water to half a million
1266600	1268640	in the south of the arid country.
1268640	1272480	Counting on several financiers from across the Arab world, the project will pipe water
1272480	1276860	to urban and rural users in a bid to minimize the gap between the two and help to realize
1276860	1279320	the region's agricultural potential.
1279320	1283200	From a country with limited water to one with little land, it's been a momentous year
1283200	1287480	for sports fans on the island of Comoros, as the nation of under a million was ground
1287480	1290880	zero for a history-making run by the national soccer team.
1290880	1295240	Minnows on the continental level, Comoros held World Cup qualifiers Egypt to a draw
1295240	1299680	and went unbeaten during the African Cup League of Nations qualifying stage—a Cinderella
1299680	1303080	run that will see the nation make the cup tournament for the first time.
1303080	1307200	Not bad for a team that didn't even exist until 2006.
1307200	1311980	As Team Caesars, we don't condone tossing trash into the ocean, but sometimes such littering
1311980	1313760	lends itself to a story.
1313760	1317940	Picking up plastic along the beaches of Papua New Guinean Island, Steve and Amos stumbled
1317940	1322760	across a message in the bottle that had traveled 1,500 miles or 2,400 kilometers after being
1322760	1325480	tossed overboard by an American sailor two years prior.
1325480	1329760	In a nation struggling with major plastic pollution, perhaps Amos smiled not only at
1329760	1333920	the friendly note, but also at the fact that it was contained in a nice, reusable glass
1333920	1335200	bottle.
1335200	1338180	How young is too young to charge someone with a crime?
1338180	1341980	Pakistan faced down this very question when they charged an eight-year-old of blasphemy
1341980	1345300	when the Hindu child peed in an Islamic school library.
1345300	1349720	In the incident's wake, police charged the boy while, in reaction to the perceived disrespect,
1349720	1351820	a mob vandalized a Hindu temple.
1351820	1356100	Eventually, though, the state stepped in and punished the cops who arrested the child,
1356100	1360020	dropped all charges, and organized payment for the temple's repairs.
1360020	1363880	Charges that are sticking, however, were laid against two transgender women who were simply
1363880	1367740	having dinner in Cameroon when they were arrested for alleged homosexuality.
1368180	1372460	Later, they were sentenced to five years in jail, which some say is a death sentence in
1372460	1374540	the male-dominated prison system.
1374540	1378260	The arrests and high-profile nature of the case, as one of the women is an activist for
1378260	1383580	trans rights, exemplifies the anti-LGBTQ sentiments and laws that are still common in African
1383580	1387520	countries, with at least 30 of them criminalizing homosexuality.
1387520	1391380	Technology seems to be a storyline, and this is clearly the case for ISIS-affiliated women
1391380	1396140	held at the Ahal refugee camp in Syria, where they are marrying men they meet online in
1396140	1400160	order to receive income and the slim chance of eventual repatriation.
1400160	1404960	The camp, which is home to nearly 60,000 women and children, is teeming with squalor and
1404960	1406380	extremist ideas.
1406380	1410220	Yet, jihadist men reportedly see it as a badge of honor to care for the women there
1410220	1415220	through these virtual marriages, even though they rarely move beyond anything but digital.
1415220	1419500	For something much more tangible, a Solomon Islands man digging in his backyard to install
1419500	1423940	a septic system struck something hard, but this was the opposite of treasure.
1423940	1429220	Instead, he discovered more than 100 unexploded World War II bombs, which came as a real surprise
1429220	1433640	and a tragic reminder of the devastation the Pacific Islands suffered during that era,
1433640	1437780	when thousands of bombs were dropped and munition stores, like this one, were common.
1437780	1442780	The ordinances were successfully, and thankfully, removed by a specialist team.
1442780	1448100	In the opposite of underground, Zimbabwe plans to launch its first satellite, the ZIMSAT-1,
1448100	1449100	in February.
1449100	1452840	It will be used to help organizations and officials collect data that relates to ground
1452840	1456720	cover and drought, as well as transmit signals for amateur radio stations.
1456720	1460920	Zimbabwe's space program has grown quickly in just three years since being established,
1460920	1464960	and follows on the heels of other African countries extending upward as well.
1464960	1469220	Though many countries focus on the pressing humanitarian needs first, the continent's
1469220	1474080	satellite fleet now stands at 44 as they increasingly recognize the importance of strategic space
1474080	1475600	investment.
1475600	1480200	Break out those dancing shoes, because the Rumba may officially be a part of worldwide
1480200	1482580	intangible cultural heritage.
1482580	1486740	The Republic of the Congo and the Democratic Republic of the Congo apply to UNESCO for
1486740	1491900	the official designation, which would protect the dance's history and cement its importance.
1491900	1496600	The Rumba was born in 19th century Cuba, combining the drumming of enslaved Africans with the
1496600	1498180	melodies of Spanish colonizers.
1498180	1502420	But it's not just of historical importance, because the Rumba has modern-day relevance
1502420	1507540	too, including the 1960s independence cha-cha—a version of the Rumba that celebrated the freedom
1507540	1509260	of Belgian Congo.
1509260	1513300	In the same region, downstream effects from an Angolan diamond mine were catastrophically
1513300	1518240	felt in a toxic spill that sickened more than 1 million people, killed 12, and decimated
1518240	1519700	fish and wildlife.
1519700	1523920	Waste from the largest diamond mine in Angola leaked into the Khazai River, which eventually
1523920	1527900	reached the Congo River, where large amounts of heavy metal were detected.
1527900	1532180	The mine, which is partially owned by a Russian company, acknowledged there had been a leak,
1532180	1536260	but said that it was just sand and mud, and of course, they claimed no responsibility
1536260	1537260	for the disaster.
1537260	1541080	There's no accountability in this story either, but there is a bit of good news from
1541080	1544780	a country that's increasingly cracking down on the freedom of the press.
1544780	1548700	Myanmar released American journalist Danny Fenster from prison just days after he was
1548700	1553820	sentenced to 11 years for charges that included incitement of violence and visa violations.
1553820	1557860	The military in Myanmar has clamped down on the media since seizing power in February,
1557860	1561700	stripping publications of their licenses, and banning outlets from broadcasting.
1561700	1566660	Fenster, however, was the first foreign journalist to be convicted for charges he says were without
1566660	1572940	warrant, and thanks to negotiations by a former US ambassador to the UN, now he'll go free.
1572940	1576740	Imprisonment in an authoritarian country is one person's nightmare, while 10 million
1576740	1581320	fruit bats descending on a condensed swamp area might sound like another's.
1581320	1584540	But for conservationists in Zambia, it's essential.
1584540	1588760	The bats are key to African ecology because they eat fruits and berries and distribute
1588760	1591080	the seeds during their continental migration.
1591080	1596180	Now these environmentalists are fighting a proposal for a 17,500-acre or 7,000-hectare
1596180	1600620	wheat, soy, and corn farm that would be built on the national park's borders and threaten
1600620	1604340	the bats' habitat, and existence, altogether.
1604340	1609400	In another story about West African instability, Guinea Junta leader Mamadi Dombuya was sworn
1609400	1614100	in after a successful September coup, marking the fourth coup in the region in the past
1614100	1615100	year.
1615100	1618940	Dombuya's party overthrew former president Alpha Conde for what they said would continue
1618940	1623420	corruption, but political upheaval continues to mire the area, and now Regional Economic
1623420	1628480	Council has placed economic sanctions and travel restrictions on the Ghanaian junta.
1628480	1632620	Sometimes government overreach isn't always so unpleasant, as is the case with a defanged
1632620	1634620	and declawed lion named Hima.
1634620	1638540	He was reunited with his owner after the Cambodian prime minister got involved.
1638540	1642980	Initially, Hima was seized after TikTok videos of him living casually in a high-end Phnom
1642980	1646660	Penh neighborhood, something the government deemed inappropriate, went viral.
1646660	1651180	But additional posts showed a clear bond between the two after their separation, and following
1651180	1656900	public calls for reunification, the prime minister announced the two would be rejoined.
1656900	1661900	Speaking of lions, Kenya is known as a wildlife wonderland, but just how many creatures crawl
1661900	1667380	there was an unknown number until the country completed its first wildlife census this year.
1667380	1672340	Using planes, drones, helicopters, boats, and 4x4s, researchers tallied the populations
1672340	1677180	of more than 30 species across nearly 60% of the country to establish a baseline for
1677180	1680220	one of the world's most unique ecological places.
1680260	1685300	Using estimates from the past, the numbers of elephants, some 36,280, seem to be going
1685300	1691820	up, but black rhinos, just 897, have fallen to critically endangered levels.
1691820	1695980	Kenya counts wildlife, and Nepal counts how many people reached the top of Mount Everest.
1695980	1700780	Now, they're unhappy with three Indian climbers who allegedly falsified their summit of the
1700780	1703300	world's highest peak in 2016.
1703300	1707060	This year, the Nepalese government penalized them by banning them for six years, essentially
1707060	1710380	preventing them from actually trying to get to the top another time.
1710380	1714060	The Nepalese ministry verifies climbs through photographic evidence, and while these three
1714060	1718580	had the photos, presumably photoshopped, they reportedly didn't have enough oxygen to
1718580	1721260	have feasibly completed the trip.
1721260	1725940	Back at sea level, impoverished East Timor is at an interesting economic crossroads,
1725940	1730940	exploring ecotourism, offshore drilling, and now, carbon capture storage as a way to boost
1730940	1732780	the country's revenue.
1732780	1737020	Australia has proposed capturing its own carbon waste, and paying to store it in East Timor's
1737020	1741540	nearly depleted Bayou Undan oil field, which is expected to run out in the next couple
1741540	1742660	of years.
1742660	1747280	Proponents see this as a creative environmental solution, and critics say it's simply shifting
1747280	1751220	climate change responsibility from a rich country to a poor one.
1751220	1755500	Nearby Vanuatu is a remote Pacific island which has 300,000 residents.
1755500	1760660	So, why did some 2,000 politicians, business owners, and criminals get citizenship there
1760660	1761660	recently?
1761660	1764500	Because for $130,000, they can.
1764500	1769320	The Citizenship by Investment program is legal, and gives these new residents visa-free access
1769320	1771980	to the UK and European Union.
1771980	1775820	But some worry the increased interest in this island, where the passport program accounted
1775820	1781140	for nearly 42% of government revenue in 2020, might be fertile ground for money laundering
1781140	1782540	and international mischief.
1782540	1787980	In a move that signals the increasing geopolitical importance of Africa, Twitter hired its first
1787980	1792220	employees on the continent in the country of Ghana, where freedom of speech protections
1792220	1795380	and online freedoms made it an ideal location.
1795380	1799140	The social media company announced it would fill 11 positions, with plans to officially
1799140	1804140	open an office there once pandemic restrictions and work-from-home orders are relaxed.
1804140	1809260	For more than 30 years, Eswatini's King Muswati III has ruled as an absolute monarch
1809260	1812460	and flaunted a lavish, luxurious lifestyle.
1812460	1813460	The problem?
1813460	1819460	60% of the country's 1.1 million residents live in poverty, and they're over his opulence.
1819460	1823820	For months, residents have participated in pro-democracy protests that have left scores
1823820	1826180	dead and many more wounded.
1826180	1830920	Neighboring African countries, including South Africa, upon which Eswatini heavily relies,
1830920	1834940	are stepping in to help navigate the movement, which many say won't be going away until
1834940	1837580	there's a brighter future for this developing nation.
1837580	1842060	A plot to smuggle 55 million methamphetamine tablets and more than 1.5 tons of crystal
1842060	1846900	meth disguised in beer crates was thwarted by police in Laos, resulting in the largest
1846900	1848940	single drug seizure in Asia.
1848940	1852840	They were discovered in a truck in an area called the Golden Triangle—the meeting point
1852840	1858460	of Myanmar, Laos, and Thailand, which is notorious as a hotspot for drug production and smuggling.
1858460	1862580	With recent unrest in Myanmar's Shan region and Chinese crackdown on the trade, smugglers
1862580	1867160	have looked to alternate routes—in this case, without much success.
1867160	1872100	In another superlative, Pacific Islander Nicole Yamase became the first citizen of the Federated
1872100	1877020	States of Micronesia to reach Challenger Deep—the deepest part of the Mariana Trench, which lies
1877020	1879380	within the territorial waters of the country.
1879380	1884600	Her completion of the 10-hour journey, which took her to 36,000 feet or 11,000 meters below
1884600	1890020	the ocean's surface, also makes her only the third woman, and at 29, the second youngest,
1890020	1891020	to ever do it.
1891020	1895620	She's a PhD student studying climate change's effects on microalgae, and going to the world's
1895620	1898660	most remote places for research is all in a day's work for her.
1898660	1903340	On the topic of climate change, in an effort to reduce its dependence on fossil fuels,
1903340	1908060	Nel Tomé and Principe made an innovative announcement involving deep-water platforms,
1908060	1909740	but not the oil kind.
1909740	1914540	Instead, they're engaging in a public-private partnership to debut ocean thermal energy
1914540	1918520	conversion technology—the first commercial endeavor of its kind.
1918520	1922660	The floating platforms use the difference between cold deep-ocean water and warm surface
1922660	1926340	temperatures to create green energy out of the blue.
1926340	1930820	Another island nation concerned for its future is Kiribati, where six years ago, the government
1930820	1935500	starred in its own version of House Hunters and purchased some 8.5 square miles or 22
1935500	1939080	square kilometers of land on Fiji to make sure its potentially displaced residents had
1939080	1941520	somewhere to go as sea levels rise.
1941520	1945340	To use that land in the meantime, Kiribati enlisted the help of omnipresent China to
1945340	1949180	build farms that would provide fresh produce and meat to the island nation, which currently
1949180	1950900	imports all of its food.
1950900	1955220	Some say this is another land grab by China, while others see it as a sustainability measure
1955220	1956660	for Kiribati.
1956660	1960800	Both of these takes miss what might be the most interesting part of this story—an actual
1960800	1964400	overseas climate refuge, in the first place.
1964400	1968640	Garment workers in Bangladesh are more protected after an agreement was signed by some 200
1968640	1972540	international fashion companies that includes legally binding safety commitments, independent
1972540	1977000	inspections at the factories, and contributions for safety training and factory improvements.
1977000	1981520	The accord replaces one that was created after a devastating factory fire that killed 1,100
1981520	1984040	people in 2013 and was set to expire.
1984040	1987840	Human rights workers praised the move, which means protections will continue into the future
1987840	1992240	and keep Bangladesh as one of the top garment producers in the world.
1992240	1996320	That pandemic coffee habit may be helping boost Honduras' economy, according to recent
1996320	1997640	economic reports.
1997640	2003040	GDP growth for 2021 was expected to be between 2 and 5%, but new projections show almost
2003040	2007180	double that, with the country's economy predicted to grow by almost 9%.
2007180	2011200	This is thanks to increased activity in retail and manufacturing and, because of supply chain
2011200	2015940	issues, higher prices for coffee, which is one of the country's primary exports.
2015940	2019900	If two's a party and three's a crowd, then India is taking note.
2019900	2023820	Some states, including the country's most populous, Uttar Pradesh, which has 240 million
2023820	2028100	people and would be the world's fifth most populous country by itself, introduced a China-like
2028100	2032220	two-child policy and sterilization measures to control population growth.
2032220	2035940	Though it still has to be adopted, the proposal would deny state benefits, subsidies, and
2035940	2040380	jobs to anyone who has more than two children, and dangles the carrot of incentives for anyone
2040380	2041620	who gets sterilized.
2042060	2046140	12 states have already adopted similar measures, all in an effort to limit growth in a country
2046140	2048900	that's already the second most populous in the world.
2048900	2054040	In the early 1900s, Namibia was known as German Southwest Africa, and Germany is still dealing
2054040	2058280	with its dark history there, which included troops that killed, tortured, and forced tens
2058280	2061520	of thousands of native peoples into the desert to starve.
2061520	2066200	This year, then-Chancellor Angela Merkel reached a deal that would distribute 1.1 billion euros
2066200	2070760	over 30 years to benefit aid programs in the African country, but she stopped short of
2070760	2074700	calling the funding reparations and instead said it was reconciliation money that would
2074700	2078400	help attempt to quote, heal the wounds of the past.
2078400	2082780	China continues to expand its presence around the globe, and in Bhutan this hasn't been
2082780	2083780	subtle.
2083780	2087020	In the past year, satellite imagery shows that multiple new villages have sprung up
2087020	2091720	in a 60 square mile or 150 square kilometer Bhutanese area that's been a disputed site
2091720	2095800	before when India and China went ahead about road construction there a handful of years
2095800	2096800	ago.
2096800	2099920	Because of aligned interests when it comes to Chinese overreach, India has supported
2099920	2102780	Bhutan's claims to the contested territory.
2102780	2106980	Across the world, the situation in Nicaragua right now is unequivocally bad, and it wasn't
2106980	2111460	much better in early 2021 when President Daniel Ortega opted to shoot for the moon even though
2111460	2114140	the nation is mired in social and economic misery.
2114140	2118220	That's when he established the National Ministry for Extraterrestrial Space Affairs,
2118220	2122740	the Moon, and other celestial bodies, which people are calling a vanity project.
2122740	2126380	Its goal is to develop a space agency that will reach the farthest points in the universe,
2126380	2129540	but quite literally hasn't gotten off the ground.
2130160	2135680	When one thinks of palm oil plantations, Malaysia and Indonesia usually come to mind, but Guatemala's
2135680	2140080	emerging market makes it the world's sixth largest producer of palm oil, however that
2140080	2142900	success, of course, comes at a cost.
2142900	2147200	More production has led to companies grabbing indigenous lands at an alarming rate.
2147200	2151760	In response, some of Guatemala's indigenous population, almost 40% of the country's
2151760	2156600	17 million residents, are resisting by forcefully moving back onto the land.
2156660	2160480	The number of baby sea turtle numbers on the 10 island nation of Cape Verde are booming
2160480	2161940	in a rabbit-like way.
2161940	2166680	The good news is that nest numbers last year were up to 200,000, which is 20 times the
2166680	2168400	estimates from 2015.
2168400	2172660	The bad news is that sea turtles' gender is determined by the temperature of the sand
2172660	2177920	where the eggs are laid, and, well, the globally warmed beach means that about 84% of baby
2177920	2182060	sea turtle hatchlings are now female, which unfortunately still keeps that species on
2182060	2183060	the endangered list.
2183520	2187160	When it comes to finding fodder for Central Asian's geopolitical cocktail talk, here's
2187160	2191160	a fun fact—Tajikistan's primary export is migrant labor.
2191160	2196520	By September 2021, more than 1.6 million Tajiks left the country to work in Russia.
2196520	2200480	These migrant workers then send billions of dollars in remittances back home.
2200480	2205640	In 2019, actually, this figure accounted for more than one quarter of Tajikistan's GDP,
2205640	2209640	making the ex-Soviet country still very dependent on Russia.
2209640	2213180	Anyone who invested early in Bitcoin should head straight to El Salvador, where they can
2213180	2217660	make it crypto rain now that the country became the first in the world to adopt the currency
2217660	2218820	as legal tender.
2218820	2223060	Though some, including major lender the International Monetary Fund, are skeptical because of the
2223060	2227460	volatile and risky nature of cryptocurrencies, others are optimistic, such as Salvadorians
2227460	2231820	who can dip into their Chiva wallet app and find $30 of Bitcoin waiting for them.
2231820	2236060	In the ongoing fight against ISIS, officials in Iraq declared a moderate victory with the
2236060	2240600	capture of the Islamic State's finance minister, Sami Jassim Al-Ajuz.
2240600	2244600	The arrest could provide Iraq and international allies with a treasure trove of intelligence
2244600	2248520	about the terrorist organization that, although has retreated from daily headlines in recent
2248520	2252260	years, maintains quite active in sleeper cells throughout the Middle East.
2252260	2255980	Two residents in Guyana are not staying quiet about protecting the planet, something they
2255980	2259320	argue is a fundamental right to humanity's sustainability.
2259320	2263000	The pair is suing their country for having approved oil exploration licenses, saying
2263000	2266240	it violates the government's legal duty to protect the right of future generations
2266240	2267720	to a healthy environment.
2267720	2271720	This David versus Goliath fight pits them against ExxonMobil, which is eyeing a potential
2271720	2275780	8 billion gallons of oil in offshore drilling, which would make it the company's largest
2275780	2277620	extraction site in the world.
2277620	2282180	There's nothing like the discovery of 1.3 million year old stone tools to make this
2282180	2285400	point in time seem, well, short.
2285400	2288900	Archaeologists in Morocco recently discovered the artifacts in a site associated with human
2288900	2293140	ancestor Homo erectus, almost doubling the previous start date for the dawn of the stone
2293140	2294900	tool era in North Africa.
2294900	2299020	What's mind-boggling is that these tools aren't even close to the oldest traces of
2299020	2303580	human ancestors, which date all the way back to more than 4 million years ago.
2303580	2308180	In Kyrgyzstan, Central Asia's only democracy, just over one third of the population turned
2308180	2313400	out in a snap election that put populist politician and convicted kidnapper Sadr Japarov into
2313400	2314400	power.
2314400	2317660	The former Soviet country sits between China, which has invested in its infrastructure,
2317660	2321400	and Russia, to which it still has significant loyalties, including from its newly elected
2321400	2325240	president who has vowed to remain allied with both neighbors—something that will be tough
2325240	2328900	to balance amid his own country's partially self-inflicted political turmoil.
2328900	2332980	There's some positive news about elephants coming out of Gabon, where new research shows
2332980	2337060	the population of forest elephants, a cousin to the savannah-dwelling pachyderms, seem
2337060	2339220	to be doing better than expected.
2339220	2342780	Previous estimates reported there were about 50,000 left in the Central African country,
2342780	2347380	but a recent study shows that number to be closer to 95,000, thanks to strict anti-poaching
2347420	2350180	regulations and land conservation measures.
2350180	2354020	Athleisure-wearing, latte-drinking urbanites might need an extra downward dog and a shot
2354020	2357740	of espresso to deal with their supply chain woes this year, especially with products like
2357740	2361860	Lululemon and coffee coming from Vietnam, where a combination of lockdowns and factory
2361860	2366020	conditions has prompted millions of workers to leave cities and return to their countryside
2366020	2367020	homes.
2367020	2370620	Manufacturers are having a tough time luring them back, and that was bad news for a supply
2370620	2372660	chain already in crisis.
2372660	2376540	An Arizona man who conducted a years-long human trafficking ring selling babies from
2376540	2380380	the Marshall Islands to American parents was sentenced to six years in prison and forced
2380380	2383140	to pay hundreds of thousands in restitution charges.
2383140	2387380	The man would pay around $10,000 for pregnant Marshallese women to come to the United States
2387380	2391420	and then arrange for their newborns to be adopted by couples for $40,000.
2391420	2395320	Officials estimate some 70 adoptions took place this way, taking advantage of the Compact
2395320	2399960	of Free Association, which allowed them to travel or move to the US without restriction.
2399960	2404820	On the subject of pregnancy, Polish researchers discovered a first—an Egyptian mummy with
2404820	2405820	child.
2405820	2409620	Originally they thought the mummy-mummy was a male priest, but further investigation uncovered
2409620	2414500	a small femur bone thought to belong to a fetus about 25 to 30 weeks old.
2414500	2417900	Scientists call the find unique and important to Egyptology, in which little research has
2417900	2419940	been done on females.
2419940	2424240	In not-so-sweet news, Ben & Jerry's announced it would stop selling its ice cream in occupied
2424240	2429180	Palestinian territories, making a very public corporate statement against the Israeli settlements
2429180	2432140	there, which are not recognized by international law.
2432140	2436440	Israeli officials called the decision a quote, capitulation to anti-Semitism.
2436440	2439860	The brand, however, will still be available throughout the internationally recognized
2439860	2442660	territory of Israel, which sort of makes this ban half-baked.
2442660	2447340	It's banned for poachers to remove succulents from the desert in South Africa, but that
2447340	2450860	hasn't stopped it from being an explosive problem in a country that's home to one
2450860	2453220	third of the world's succulent species.
2453220	2457360	Specifically, people are harvesting Conophytum, which is a genus of flowering plants that
2457360	2461140	consists of over 100 species, many of which are on the endangered list.
2461140	2464840	They're then sold to hot markets including Korea and China, where the plants that were
2464840	2468980	once considered low-class had become popular for being low-maintenance.
2468980	2472540	Across the pond, Venezuelans have been fleeing their country in one of the world's largest
2472540	2476220	human migrations, and one third of them head to neighboring Colombia.
2476220	2479820	Recently, Colombia announced its decision to provide temporary legal status to more
2479820	2483460	than 1.7 million migrants who had fled there in recent years.
2483460	2486260	That means the migrants can work legally for up to ten years.
2486260	2490560	A collapsed economy has created a humanitarian crisis, and refugees in search of a better
2490560	2494580	life may find that with Colombia's legal acceptance of them.
2494580	2499440	Last year, the president of Turkmenistan erected a gilded statue of a beloved breed of dog,
2499440	2500440	the Alabai.
2500440	2505600	This year, he took it a step further and announced a national holiday honoring the large, shepherd-like
2505600	2506600	canine.
2506600	2511360	This holiday included a contest for the country's best dog, and a medal given to its top border
2511360	2512360	guard dog.
2512360	2516860	Alabai now shares the special day with another of Turkmenistan celebrated—the Akhalteki
2516860	2517860	horse breed.
2517860	2522180	Both are considered important parts of the national heritage, where herding is a traditional
2522180	2523180	pastime.
2523180	2527380	Traditionally, the transfer of power is supposed to be peaceful and seamless.
2527380	2529060	In Samoa, it wasn't.
2529060	2533400	Fiamme Naomi Mata'afa finally became the country's prime minister in July, following
2533400	2538340	several months of constitutional crisis during which her predecessor, Toilepa Salele Malele
2538340	2540960	Gaiawe, refused to acknowledge her victory.
2540960	2544700	The former leader had led the country for more than two decades, and would not step
2544700	2545700	down.
2545700	2549440	After a series of legal battles and appeals, Mata'afa finally assumed control and is
2549440	2553160	making history doing it as Samoa's first female prime minister.
2553160	2558260	In Belize, officials are both making and saving history—ecologically, that is.
2558260	2562760	This year, a coalition of conservation organizations banded together to save one of the world's
2562760	2568000	last pristine rainforests, preserving 367 square miles, or 950 square kilometers of
2568000	2569720	land from deforestation.
2569720	2573920	This area is part of the larger Belize Maya forest, which crosses Mexico, Belize, and
2573920	2578220	Guatemala, and means a biodiversity hotspot roughly the size of Florida will be saved
2578220	2579900	in perpetuity.
2579900	2583820	Something that's not going to last forever is Filipino president Rodrigo Duterte, who
2583820	2587260	is constitutionally barred from seeking another six-year term.
2587260	2591260	Ahead of the May elections, those looking to replace him include a potpourri of people,
2591260	2595020	including his daughter Sara Duterte, son and namesake of the country's former dictator
2595020	2600420	Ferdinand Bongbong Marcos, former actor and Manila mayor Francisco Domogoso, and newly
2600420	2602680	retired boxing star Manny Pacquiao.
2602700	2606380	With candidates expected to perform on stage with the public judging them on their singing
2606380	2610820	and dancing abilities, the pool is certainly high on the entertainment factor.
2610820	2616300	To the south, the Indonesian island of Biak is becoming an unexpected player in Elon Musk's
2616300	2617300	world.
2617300	2620980	That's because Indonesian president Joko Widodo, as part of his goal to modernize the
2620980	2624700	nation, personally pitched the tech giant on launching spacecraft from the island that
2624700	2628060	sits 70 miles or 110 kilometers south of the equator.
2628060	2632520	Facing displacement, the indigenous population isn't supportive of the proposal.
2632520	2638120	Musk has also stayed mum on the issue, but we all know his penchant for explosive announcements.
2638120	2642080	Atmospheric conditions also made headlines in Bolivia, where UV radiation levels in La
2642080	2646400	Paz hit 21, and that's on a scale that typically tops out at 20.
2646400	2651360	The Bolivian capital sits at 11,800 feet or 3,600 meters above sea level, and low levels
2651360	2655560	of clouds caused by climate change combined with a heatwave skyrocketed numbers on the
2655560	2656560	UV index.
2656560	2660980	The World Health Organization calls an index of 11 extreme, and 10 minutes exposed at these
2660980	2662980	levels start to burn the skin.
2662980	2665840	At 21, people just stay inside.
2665840	2669760	More than doubling the age of most of her competitors, a 46-year-old gymnast representing
2669760	2673420	Uzbekistan took her final bow at the Olympics in Tokyo this summer.
2673420	2678420	It was Oksana Chusovotinya's 8th Olympics—she won the silver medal for vault in 2008 and
2678420	2682460	capped off with 11 medals won at 17 world championships.
2682460	2686940	Up next, spending more time with her Olympic wrestling husband and her son, who at 22,
2686940	2689780	is older than most Olympic gymnasts.
2689780	2693460	In Libya, there's some frightening news on the artificial intelligence front.
2693460	2697260	A report commissioned by the United Nations found that a military drone strike used in
2697260	2700660	the country's civil war may have been carried out autonomously.
2700660	2705120	Allegedly, militia fighters were hunted down and attacked by a quote, weapon system that
2705120	2706740	did not require data connectivity.
2706740	2711620	Though it's implied, the report doesn't go as far as to say the drone acted autonomously.
2711620	2715920	The vagueness here is de rigueur as the report also doesn't say whether anyone was injured
2715920	2716920	or killed.
2716920	2720780	The island nation of Tonga managed to largely avoid the global pandemic, but it's dealing
2720780	2725460	with its own epidemic now as methamphetamine use has become pervasive and very problematic
2725460	2726860	in the country of 100,000.
2726860	2730660	It's so bad that the king made a plea to Tongan parliament asking for help with the
2730660	2735080	crisis, which is accounting for 60% of admissions to Tonga's mental health wards and filling
2735080	2736420	up local prisons.
2736420	2740260	Tonga has long been a stop on the drug route from Asia to New Zealand and Australia—this
2740260	2744340	just means that the drugs are increasingly stopping instead of passing through.
2744340	2746820	Something else that's stopping is the Piranha River.
2746820	2751300	South America's second largest river straddles Paraguay, Argentina, and Brazil, and sadly,
2751300	2754620	it's the lowest it's been in more than 70 years.
2754620	2758580	Scientists say deforestation in the Amazon is to blame, as rainfall, much of which emanates
2758580	2761520	from the forest itself, has significantly decreased.
2761520	2766100	As a result, the river is 10.5 feet or 3 meters lower than normal, and threatening the lives
2766100	2770660	and businesses of people who populate more than 60 towns along its shores.
2770660	2774660	Also threatening was two men's plot to unseat Jordan's King Abdullah, a crime for which
2774660	2777240	they were sentenced to 15 years in prison.
2777240	2780660	They were aides to the king's half-brother, who was removed from the line of succession
2780660	2781660	in 2004.
2781660	2786120	But not to be deterred, his plan using these proxies included rallying civilian support
2786120	2787460	to oust Abdullah.
2787460	2788460	The twist?
2788460	2792460	Some say all three may have been unknowingly backed by the Trump administration, who saw
2792460	2796640	Abdullah as an obstacle in securing an Israeli-Palestinian peace treaty.
2796640	2800900	The king, however, will remain in power, and these two will go to jail.
2800900	2805500	When an immigrant commits a crime in the United Kingdom, they get deported, often by airplane.
2805500	2809340	Lately, however, the loads have been light with just four people sent back to Jamaica
2809340	2813700	on a recent 350-passenger Airbus A350-900 flight.
2813700	2818460	That evens out to about $66,000 or 50,000 pounds per person.
2818460	2822260	These cost happy people wondering about the viability of such an expensive program, while
2822260	2826380	others say it's critical to get convicted criminals out of the country.
2826380	2830700	Finds that will happily be sent overseas includes two of the world's largest diamonds unearthed
2830700	2837340	this year in Botswana—a 1,174-carat and 1,098-carat diamond were both discovered weeks
2837340	2841420	apart in the country's mines, which are some of the top-producing in the world.
2841420	2845020	Each diamond is about the size of someone's hand, and they come at an important time for
2845020	2849140	the market, which is trying to rebound after the pandemic—bright news for the country
2849140	2851200	and the soon-to-be betrothed.
2851200	2854760	Later unearthing took place in Mongolia, where archaeologists were able to use a new
2854760	2859360	technology to look below ground and map the ancient city of Karakorum, the capital of
2859360	2863040	the Mongolian Empire, established by Genghis Khan in the 1200s.
2863040	2867240	Using magnetic fields to determine the footprint's layout and structural composition, the researchers
2867240	2871480	determined, among other things, that the city was only at about 40% capacity—likely home
2871480	2875960	to laborers and craftspeople—while the majority lived a more nomadic lifestyle.
2875960	2877440	And that brings us to halfway.
2877440	2881480	We'll plow through the remaining 98 entries on Friday when part two is released, but you
