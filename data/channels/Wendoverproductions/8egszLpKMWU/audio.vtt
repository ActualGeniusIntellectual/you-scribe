00:11.040 --> 00:17.440
In our lifetimes, the dominant story of economic explosion has been that of China.

00:17.440 --> 00:21.760
Previously, it was a poor, vast, peripheral country.

00:21.760 --> 00:26.680
In mere decades, though, its growth has pulled it to center stage, and the country now plays

00:26.680 --> 00:29.660
a serious role in world affairs.

00:29.660 --> 00:34.860
At the core of that transformation now behind us, however, many have asked the question,

00:34.860 --> 00:36.660
who's next?

00:36.660 --> 00:42.160
Which corner of the world is set for a similar, dramatic rise in the coming years?

00:42.160 --> 00:47.100
Plenty of candidates come up, but one of the most frequently floated names is Africa.

00:47.100 --> 00:52.860
It's a continent with a huge population, but a generally lower level of economic development.

00:52.860 --> 00:58.740
It's a region that often, in many ways, falls behind, but that means the only direction

00:58.740 --> 01:00.380
to go is up.

01:00.380 --> 01:07.020
So, is the African continent poised to become the next China—the next darling of the world

01:07.020 --> 01:08.500
economy?

01:08.500 --> 01:13.980
Africa is a sprawling continent three times the size of Europe, composed of 54 countries,

01:13.980 --> 01:19.500
1.4 billion people, and countless religions, languages, ethnic groups, and cultures.

01:19.500 --> 01:24.380
Many appropriately criticize media when they overzealously refer to the continent as one,

01:24.380 --> 01:27.940
generalizing what's happening in part of the continent to its entirety, but there is

01:27.940 --> 01:32.980
logic and precedent for examining Africa as a cohesive unit from an economic lens,

01:32.980 --> 01:33.980
at least.

01:33.980 --> 01:38.440
For the purposes of simplicity, economists and journalists often group related countries

01:38.440 --> 01:40.780
together into business regions.

01:40.780 --> 01:45.580
For example, often, economists will look at the European economy as a whole since France's

01:45.580 --> 01:50.420
economy, for example, is deeply interwoven with Germany's, so their fates are essentially

01:50.420 --> 01:51.420
tied.

01:51.420 --> 01:55.460
Meanwhile, they'll often look at China by itself since it's large enough to be analogous

01:55.460 --> 02:00.140
to Europe, but also unique and isolated enough economically that grouping it with Japan,

02:00.140 --> 02:05.140
for example, would not be appropriate—Japan can prosper when China does not, and vice

02:05.140 --> 02:06.140
versa.

02:06.140 --> 02:11.020
That's why China is worth examining on its own while Africa is examined as a whole.

02:11.020 --> 02:15.420
The countries that compose the continent are economically interlinked and add up to a population

02:15.420 --> 02:17.380
comparable to China's.

02:17.380 --> 02:22.980
Therefore, in this context, one could expect that the development potential of Africa could

02:22.980 --> 02:26.100
be roughly akin to that of China.

02:26.100 --> 02:28.180
But we can quantify this.

02:28.180 --> 02:33.700
The African continent's current gross domestic product is $2.69 trillion.

02:33.700 --> 02:41.260
China's GDP in 2006 was, inflation adjusted, $2.89 trillion, meaning the African economy

02:41.260 --> 02:45.620
today is roughly analogous to that of 2006 China.

02:45.620 --> 02:50.700
This is backed up by the fact that Africa's GDP per capita is currently $2,030, while

02:50.700 --> 02:53.460
in 2006 China's was $2,100.

02:53.460 --> 02:58.100
Africa's urbanization rate is roughly equal to China's in 2008, while their foreign

02:58.100 --> 03:02.460
direct investment inflows are about the same as China's in 1992.

03:02.460 --> 03:07.540
All around, these four important economic development indicators suggest that Africa

03:07.540 --> 03:11.380
stands roughly 20 years behind today's China.

03:11.380 --> 03:17.300
Now, it would be staggering if this were the case—if in a mere two decades, the African

03:17.300 --> 03:20.580
economy would be as relevant as China's today.

03:20.580 --> 03:25.360
Of course, some would have said the same about China decades ago, but economic indicators

03:25.360 --> 03:31.740
are often, counterintuitively, not the most helpful in determining economic growth prospects.

03:31.740 --> 03:35.220
China did not grow off of natural resources.

03:35.220 --> 03:39.820
So too, Africa is not likely to grow off of natural resources.

03:39.820 --> 03:44.440
Both have extensive resources, but economists have observed a phenomenon globally that they

03:44.440 --> 03:46.940
refer to as the resource curse.

03:46.980 --> 03:52.600
Essentially, an abundance of natural resources does not regularly translate well into sustainable

03:52.600 --> 03:54.060
economic growth.

03:54.060 --> 03:58.780
The reasons behind this are hotly contested and quite complex, but one of the simpler

03:58.780 --> 04:03.740
contributing factors is the tendency of resource-based economies to concentrate wealth to a select

04:03.740 --> 04:04.740
few.

04:04.740 --> 04:08.740
While a diamond mine owner might grow rich, the workers in the mine aren't learning

04:08.740 --> 04:12.940
any skills that they can use to innovate, start their own business, and grow the economy.

04:12.940 --> 04:17.300
They just aren't getting educated, and there's no direct incentive on a national

04:17.300 --> 04:21.560
level to improve formal education, since the money that's being made is through jobs

04:21.560 --> 04:24.620
that do not require a high level of education.

04:24.620 --> 04:29.740
In the case of China, manufacturing, which was a major driving force behind its development,

04:29.740 --> 04:34.100
gave many the skills needed to start their own businesses, and there is now a significant,

04:34.100 --> 04:38.740
homegrown tech sector in China that's helping to carry its economy beyond manufacturing.

04:38.740 --> 04:44.540
So, if Africa's going to have a China-style economic explosion, it's going to be because

04:44.540 --> 04:48.020
of human capital, rather than natural resources.

04:48.020 --> 04:52.880
However, that's where the story gets less optimistic.

04:52.880 --> 04:56.860
One relevant demographic indicator is the dependency ratio.

04:56.860 --> 05:02.200
That's a number calculated by dividing the population 14 and under or 65 and over by

05:02.200 --> 05:04.100
the population between those ages.

05:04.620 --> 05:09.280
While it's not perfect, it's a rough index of how many people each working person in

05:09.280 --> 05:13.940
an economy has to support—either directly or through welfare systems.

05:13.940 --> 05:19.380
Now, in general, lower dependency ratios are better for an economy—having less people

05:19.380 --> 05:24.860
to support and a greater percent of people working is financially beneficial—and correspondently,

05:24.860 --> 05:28.620
most developed economies have low dependency ratios.

05:28.620 --> 05:34.700
The US, for example, has a dependency ratio of 54%, indicating that for every 10 working-age

05:34.700 --> 05:37.100
people, there are 5.4 dependents.

05:37.100 --> 05:42.780
Africa's, meanwhile, is 79%—far higher, largely due to the large youth population

05:42.780 --> 05:45.540
in many of the continent's countries.

05:45.540 --> 05:51.100
That puts this metric closest to China's in 1974, before their dependency ratio plummeted

05:51.100 --> 05:55.740
in step with falling birth rates, as the country started to encourage then mandate one child

05:55.740 --> 05:56.740
per couple.

05:56.740 --> 06:03.320
So, this demographic indicator is, relative to China's, far behind chronologically compared

06:03.320 --> 06:05.820
to the earlier economic indicators.

06:05.820 --> 06:10.700
But as important as the current state of the dependency ratio is to an economy, a stronger

06:10.700 --> 06:16.180
predictor of the future is the trend—is the ratio rising, falling, or staying the

06:16.180 --> 06:17.180
same?

06:17.180 --> 06:22.940
The answer for Africa is easy—continent wide, the average in 1990 was 93%, compared

06:22.940 --> 06:25.100
to today's 79%.

06:25.100 --> 06:30.620
Their dependency ratio is falling, but this is like the 2D view of this demographic shift.

06:30.620 --> 06:36.500
What's even more useful is the 3D view—the population pyramid.

06:36.500 --> 06:41.180
These graphs are simple—each row represents a five-year age bracket, with the left side

06:41.180 --> 06:45.980
indicating the size of the male population in that bracket, and the right side the female

06:45.980 --> 06:46.980
population.

06:46.980 --> 06:51.180
Africa's pyramid indicates that the continent has a disproportionately young population,

06:51.180 --> 06:53.780
which is common for less-developed regions.

06:53.780 --> 06:58.860
Meanwhile, Europe's population pyramid, like those of many more-developed regions,

06:58.860 --> 07:04.220
indicates that its population is disproportionately middle-aged as it ages and birth rates decline.

07:04.220 --> 07:09.620
Now, China's pyramid is undoubtedly affected by the impact of its one-child policy, but

07:09.620 --> 07:14.900
looking at its progression since 1950, it demonstrates a powerful phenomenon.

07:14.900 --> 07:20.820
Through the 50s and 60s, birth rates are higher, meaning a large youth population arises.

07:20.860 --> 07:26.580
Then, starting in the 70s, birth rates decline, but the large youth population is still alive

07:26.580 --> 07:28.660
and moves into working age.

07:28.660 --> 07:32.980
This population bubble moves up the pyramid, creating a situation where there is a huge

07:32.980 --> 07:38.660
working age population, and very few youth or seniors that this population has to support.

07:38.660 --> 07:45.200
By 2010, this pushed China's dependency ratio down to just 36%, almost unprecedentedly

07:45.200 --> 07:47.380
low for a large economy.

07:47.380 --> 07:52.820
In fact, today, the only countries with a lower dependency ratio are small nations like

07:52.820 --> 07:58.020
Qatar, the UAE, or Singapore, which have high immigrant labor populations that grow up and

07:58.020 --> 08:01.860
retire in their home countries, thereby skewing the statistics.

08:01.860 --> 08:07.460
Now, China's dependency ratio has since creeped up to 42%, as this Belgian population

08:07.460 --> 08:12.260
from the 50s and 60s has started to move into retirement age, becoming dependent once again,

08:12.260 --> 08:16.900
but the time period with the lowest dependency ratio corresponds well with the period in

08:16.900 --> 08:20.460
which the country experienced the most dramatic economic growth.

08:20.460 --> 08:27.100
One study found that China can attribute 9.2% of its economic growth between 1960 and 2000

08:27.100 --> 08:29.180
to this bulge in the working age population.

08:29.180 --> 08:33.980
That's a small percent in isolation, but in the context of the complexities of national

08:33.980 --> 08:36.340
development, massive.

08:36.340 --> 08:41.060
At the simplest level, people and the government could invest money into growth, rather than

08:41.060 --> 08:45.700
social support for the young and old, which helped accelerate development.

08:45.700 --> 08:50.740
The economic boost that ensues from this short-term population bulge has a name—it's

08:50.740 --> 08:53.540
called the demographic dividend.

08:53.540 --> 08:58.620
Estimates indicate a demographic dividend is coming for Africa as its birth rates decline,

08:58.620 --> 09:01.780
but potentially one less pronounced than China's.

09:01.780 --> 09:08.180
Current population projections would put Africa's 2050 dependency ratio at 60.7%, certainly

09:08.180 --> 09:15.060
a significant improvement from today's 79%, but a far cry from China's 36% low point.

09:15.100 --> 09:22.260
In fact, that dependency ratio is higher than today's world average, which sits at 54.5%.

09:22.260 --> 09:25.500
The future is not, however, set in stone.

09:25.500 --> 09:30.860
Now, the demographic dividend typically isn't, as some might speculate, a byproduct of development

09:30.860 --> 09:31.860
itself.

09:31.860 --> 09:36.860
It's well established that birth rates fall in step with development, but recent research

09:36.860 --> 09:43.480
suggests that the strongest trigger for a demographic dividend is, in fact, education.

09:43.480 --> 09:46.720
Women have fewer children when they are better educated.

09:46.720 --> 09:51.760
Currently, Africa's average secondary school enrollment by women as a proportion of total

09:51.760 --> 09:57.080
female population of secondary school age is 48.56%.

09:57.080 --> 10:02.640
China first attained that level in 1977, before it briefly dipped as a result of the abandonment

10:02.640 --> 10:05.480
of Cultural Revolution-era education policies.

10:05.480 --> 10:11.240
Now, of course, improved education often comes with development, meaning the three factors

10:11.240 --> 10:12.980
work in cycle.

10:12.980 --> 10:17.220
Lower education leads to a lower dependency ratio, which leads to faster development,

10:17.220 --> 10:20.780
which leads to better education, and so on and so forth.

10:20.780 --> 10:26.300
Beyond the dividend, Africa's current demographic status, relative to China's, can be further

10:26.300 --> 10:27.300
corroborated.

10:27.300 --> 10:32.860
For example, the continent's average fertility rate is closest to China's in 1974, its

10:32.860 --> 10:38.980
life expectancy parallels China's in 1976, infant fatality rate 1981, and literacy rate

10:38.980 --> 10:40.620
1982.

10:40.620 --> 10:45.620
Looking at this timeline, with the addition of the earlier economic indicators, two defined

10:45.620 --> 10:50.780
clusters appear—the demographic indicators and the economic indicators.

10:50.780 --> 10:53.300
Economically, Africa's in the 2000s.

10:53.300 --> 10:56.540
Demographically, it's in the 70s.

10:56.540 --> 11:00.420
Of course there's a big wide world of chance and circumstance out there that can get in

11:00.420 --> 11:05.300
the way, and this is a narrow way of analyzing economic prospects in the first place, but

11:05.300 --> 11:09.980
this narrow method does present two primary conclusions.

11:10.340 --> 11:14.500
First, Africa is primed for development.

11:14.500 --> 11:19.320
In all quantifiable ways, the continent is in a similar or better position than when

11:19.320 --> 11:23.740
China began its period of explosive growth in the 70s and 80s.

11:23.740 --> 11:27.860
This isn't to say the growth will inevitably happen, but it is to say that there's nothing

11:27.860 --> 11:33.900
in the indexes that suggests that the continent, on average, isn't ready or capable of starting

11:33.900 --> 11:35.260
that growth.

11:35.260 --> 11:40.660
In fact, there's everything to suggest that Africa is in the exact right situation for

11:40.660 --> 11:43.820
a similar manner of growth to start.

11:43.820 --> 11:50.260
However, secondly, the gap between economic and demographic indicators should raise red

11:50.260 --> 11:51.520
flags.

11:51.520 --> 11:57.520
It suggests that what's holding growth back, if anything, is not the economic situation

11:57.520 --> 12:00.860
of Africa—it's the state of the population.

12:00.860 --> 12:05.720
The indexes are, in aggregate, headed in the right direction, but if African countries

12:05.720 --> 12:10.580
want to reap the explosive growth benefits of a demographic dividend, they have to concentrate

12:10.580 --> 12:14.980
on measures to improve family planning, keep more young girls in school, and bring more

12:14.980 --> 12:16.860
women into the workforce.

12:16.860 --> 12:19.880
As much as these measures might seem like one's done because it's the right thing

12:19.880 --> 12:23.940
to do, because improving gender equity is a positive for a country's international

12:23.940 --> 12:29.180
image, the demographic dividend proves that they cause tangible, significant economic

12:29.180 --> 12:31.020
effects downstream.

12:31.020 --> 12:35.200
Going back to this cycle—better education causing lower dependency ratios causing faster

12:35.200 --> 12:39.820
development—what is the easiest phase in the cycle to affect?

12:39.820 --> 12:44.820
A country can't just speed up development by itself—that's the end goal, but not

12:44.820 --> 12:48.060
a factor that a country can directly manipulate.

12:48.060 --> 12:51.960
Dependency ratios are easier for a country to affect, but measures like China's one-child

12:51.960 --> 12:56.500
policy are viewed as draconian and often difficult to implement.

12:56.500 --> 13:01.160
Early family planning programs have seen success in certain countries, but are undoubtedly

13:01.160 --> 13:02.580
complex.

13:02.580 --> 13:08.540
The easiest phase in this cycle to manipulate is education, because, by its very nature,

13:08.540 --> 13:12.540
it's something that the country's government manages.

13:12.540 --> 13:17.380
The demographic dividend isn't some silver bullet for explosive development.

13:17.380 --> 13:23.740
Rather, it's one small, yet powerful example of the merits of investing in people.

13:23.740 --> 13:27.860
It's an example backing up the suggestion that Africa's economies should not be focusing

13:27.860 --> 13:32.220
all their attention on using foreign direct investment inflows by courting superpowers

13:32.220 --> 13:34.500
for development projects, for example.

13:34.500 --> 13:39.020
That's important, but so is just getting kids in school, getting households hooked

13:39.020 --> 13:43.660
up to electricity, getting people to participate in elections—improving people's quality

13:43.660 --> 13:47.860
of life matters far beyond just quality of life.

13:47.860 --> 13:51.980
So, is Africa the next China?

13:51.980 --> 13:54.260
Well, probably not.

13:54.260 --> 14:00.620
Despite the parallels, China is made up of one country—Africa, 54.

14:00.620 --> 14:06.940
China got things right once—Africa is unlikely to get things right 54 times.

14:06.940 --> 14:11.300
The data suggests that in aggregate the conditions are ripe for development, but there's still

14:11.300 --> 14:13.100
work to do.

14:13.100 --> 14:17.380
Some countries will put in that work and trigger a gold rush, while others will not.

14:17.380 --> 14:21.640
The others will eventually realize their fault and start to catch up, but this means that

14:21.640 --> 14:26.100
the fate of the continent will likely become less and less intertwined.

14:26.100 --> 14:30.320
By century's end, certain African economies will almost certainly be talked about the

14:30.320 --> 14:35.520
way China is discussed today, but the disconnected nature of the development process will likely

14:35.520 --> 14:40.040
mean that the global impact of this transformation will be less intense.

14:40.040 --> 14:44.160
That being said, the conditions are there, and the time is right.

14:44.160 --> 14:48.440
By recognizing their shortcomings and focusing on human development, Africa might not be

14:48.440 --> 14:54.040
the next China, but African countries just might be.

14:54.040 --> 14:59.080
If you've sat through all that talk of indexes and demographics and development, you clearly

14:59.080 --> 15:02.080
enjoy learning about how the world works.

15:02.080 --> 15:07.240
I obviously do too, and one way I do that is to start my day not by browsing Twitter

15:07.240 --> 15:12.300
or TikTok, but by reading through Morning Brew's free daily newsletter.

15:12.300 --> 15:16.060
It always arrives in my inbox before I wake up, and catches me up to speed on the most

15:16.060 --> 15:20.900
relevant stories in business, finance, and tech in a witty, informative style that's

15:20.900 --> 15:23.180
far more readable than traditional news.

15:23.180 --> 15:27.140
For example, this morning I was reading about the Democratic Party's proposed billionaire's

15:27.140 --> 15:31.660
tax, why college enrollment is falling in the US, and how 3D printed houses could be

15:31.660 --> 15:35.140
a solution to the construction industry's labor shortage.

15:35.140 --> 15:39.500
Following the news consistently is just about the best way to become better informed, and

15:39.500 --> 15:43.940
Morning Brew just makes it so easy, especially considering their newsletter is free.

15:43.940 --> 15:48.180
Seriously, it's not a free trial, not a discount, just a free newsletter, so give

15:48.180 --> 15:51.780
Morning Brew a shot by clicking the button on screen or heading to the link in the description,

15:51.780 --> 15:54.900
and you'll be helping support Wendover while you're at it.
