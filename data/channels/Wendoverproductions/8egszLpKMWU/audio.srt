4
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:17,440
In our lifetimes, the dominant story of economic explosion has been that of China.

5
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:21,760
Previously, it was a poor, vast, peripheral country.

6
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:26,680
In mere decades, though, its growth has pulled it to center stage, and the country now plays

7
00:00:26,680 --> 00:00:29,660
a serious role in world affairs.

8
00:00:29,660 --> 00:00:34,860
At the core of that transformation now behind us, however, many have asked the question,

9
00:00:34,860 --> 00:00:36,660
who's next?

10
00:00:36,660 --> 00:00:42,160
Which corner of the world is set for a similar, dramatic rise in the coming years?

11
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:47,100
Plenty of candidates come up, but one of the most frequently floated names is Africa.

12
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:52,860
It's a continent with a huge population, but a generally lower level of economic development.

13
00:00:52,860 --> 00:00:58,740
It's a region that often, in many ways, falls behind, but that means the only direction

14
00:00:58,740 --> 00:01:00,380
to go is up.

15
00:01:00,380 --> 00:01:07,020
So, is the African continent poised to become the next China—the next darling of the world

16
00:01:07,020 --> 00:01:08,500
economy?

17
00:01:08,500 --> 00:01:13,980
Africa is a sprawling continent three times the size of Europe, composed of 54 countries,

18
00:01:13,980 --> 00:01:19,500
1.4 billion people, and countless religions, languages, ethnic groups, and cultures.

19
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:24,380
Many appropriately criticize media when they overzealously refer to the continent as one,

20
00:01:24,380 --> 00:01:27,940
generalizing what's happening in part of the continent to its entirety, but there is

21
00:01:27,940 --> 00:01:32,980
logic and precedent for examining Africa as a cohesive unit from an economic lens,

22
00:01:32,980 --> 00:01:33,980
at least.

23
00:01:33,980 --> 00:01:38,440
For the purposes of simplicity, economists and journalists often group related countries

24
00:01:38,440 --> 00:01:40,780
together into business regions.

25
00:01:40,780 --> 00:01:45,580
For example, often, economists will look at the European economy as a whole since France's

26
00:01:45,580 --> 00:01:50,420
economy, for example, is deeply interwoven with Germany's, so their fates are essentially

27
00:01:50,420 --> 00:01:51,420
tied.

28
00:01:51,420 --> 00:01:55,460
Meanwhile, they'll often look at China by itself since it's large enough to be analogous

29
00:01:55,460 --> 00:02:00,140
to Europe, but also unique and isolated enough economically that grouping it with Japan,

30
00:02:00,140 --> 00:02:05,140
for example, would not be appropriate—Japan can prosper when China does not, and vice

31
00:02:05,140 --> 00:02:06,140
versa.

32
00:02:06,140 --> 00:02:11,020
That's why China is worth examining on its own while Africa is examined as a whole.

33
00:02:11,020 --> 00:02:15,420
The countries that compose the continent are economically interlinked and add up to a population

34
00:02:15,420 --> 00:02:17,380
comparable to China's.

35
00:02:17,380 --> 00:02:22,980
Therefore, in this context, one could expect that the development potential of Africa could

36
00:02:22,980 --> 00:02:26,100
be roughly akin to that of China.

37
00:02:26,100 --> 00:02:28,180
But we can quantify this.

38
00:02:28,180 --> 00:02:33,700
The African continent's current gross domestic product is $2.69 trillion.

39
00:02:33,700 --> 00:02:41,260
China's GDP in 2006 was, inflation adjusted, $2.89 trillion, meaning the African economy

40
00:02:41,260 --> 00:02:45,620
today is roughly analogous to that of 2006 China.

41
00:02:45,620 --> 00:02:50,700
This is backed up by the fact that Africa's GDP per capita is currently $2,030, while

42
00:02:50,700 --> 00:02:53,460
in 2006 China's was $2,100.

43
00:02:53,460 --> 00:02:58,100
Africa's urbanization rate is roughly equal to China's in 2008, while their foreign

44
00:02:58,100 --> 00:03:02,460
direct investment inflows are about the same as China's in 1992.

45
00:03:02,460 --> 00:03:07,540
All around, these four important economic development indicators suggest that Africa

46
00:03:07,540 --> 00:03:11,380
stands roughly 20 years behind today's China.

47
00:03:11,380 --> 00:03:17,300
Now, it would be staggering if this were the case—if in a mere two decades, the African

48
00:03:17,300 --> 00:03:20,580
economy would be as relevant as China's today.

49
00:03:20,580 --> 00:03:25,360
Of course, some would have said the same about China decades ago, but economic indicators

50
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:31,740
are often, counterintuitively, not the most helpful in determining economic growth prospects.

51
00:03:31,740 --> 00:03:35,220
China did not grow off of natural resources.

52
00:03:35,220 --> 00:03:39,820
So too, Africa is not likely to grow off of natural resources.

53
00:03:39,820 --> 00:03:44,440
Both have extensive resources, but economists have observed a phenomenon globally that they

54
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:46,940
refer to as the resource curse.

55
00:03:46,980 --> 00:03:52,600
Essentially, an abundance of natural resources does not regularly translate well into sustainable

56
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:54,060
economic growth.

57
00:03:54,060 --> 00:03:58,780
The reasons behind this are hotly contested and quite complex, but one of the simpler

58
00:03:58,780 --> 00:04:03,740
contributing factors is the tendency of resource-based economies to concentrate wealth to a select

59
00:04:03,740 --> 00:04:04,740
few.

60
00:04:04,740 --> 00:04:08,740
While a diamond mine owner might grow rich, the workers in the mine aren't learning

61
00:04:08,740 --> 00:04:12,940
any skills that they can use to innovate, start their own business, and grow the economy.

62
00:04:12,940 --> 00:04:17,300
They just aren't getting educated, and there's no direct incentive on a national

63
00:04:17,300 --> 00:04:21,560
level to improve formal education, since the money that's being made is through jobs

64
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:24,620
that do not require a high level of education.

65
00:04:24,620 --> 00:04:29,740
In the case of China, manufacturing, which was a major driving force behind its development,

66
00:04:29,740 --> 00:04:34,100
gave many the skills needed to start their own businesses, and there is now a significant,

67
00:04:34,100 --> 00:04:38,740
homegrown tech sector in China that's helping to carry its economy beyond manufacturing.

68
00:04:38,740 --> 00:04:44,540
So, if Africa's going to have a China-style economic explosion, it's going to be because

69
00:04:44,540 --> 00:04:48,020
of human capital, rather than natural resources.

70
00:04:48,020 --> 00:04:52,880
However, that's where the story gets less optimistic.

71
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:56,860
One relevant demographic indicator is the dependency ratio.

72
00:04:56,860 --> 00:05:02,200
That's a number calculated by dividing the population 14 and under or 65 and over by

73
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:04,100
the population between those ages.

74
00:05:04,620 --> 00:05:09,280
While it's not perfect, it's a rough index of how many people each working person in

75
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:13,940
an economy has to support—either directly or through welfare systems.

76
00:05:13,940 --> 00:05:19,380
Now, in general, lower dependency ratios are better for an economy—having less people

77
00:05:19,380 --> 00:05:24,860
to support and a greater percent of people working is financially beneficial—and correspondently,

78
00:05:24,860 --> 00:05:28,620
most developed economies have low dependency ratios.

79
00:05:28,620 --> 00:05:34,700
The US, for example, has a dependency ratio of 54%, indicating that for every 10 working-age

80
00:05:34,700 --> 00:05:37,100
people, there are 5.4 dependents.

81
00:05:37,100 --> 00:05:42,780
Africa's, meanwhile, is 79%—far higher, largely due to the large youth population

82
00:05:42,780 --> 00:05:45,540
in many of the continent's countries.

83
00:05:45,540 --> 00:05:51,100
That puts this metric closest to China's in 1974, before their dependency ratio plummeted

84
00:05:51,100 --> 00:05:55,740
in step with falling birth rates, as the country started to encourage then mandate one child

85
00:05:55,740 --> 00:05:56,740
per couple.

86
00:05:56,740 --> 00:06:03,320
So, this demographic indicator is, relative to China's, far behind chronologically compared

87
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:05,820
to the earlier economic indicators.

88
00:06:05,820 --> 00:06:10,700
But as important as the current state of the dependency ratio is to an economy, a stronger

89
00:06:10,700 --> 00:06:16,180
predictor of the future is the trend—is the ratio rising, falling, or staying the

90
00:06:16,180 --> 00:06:17,180
same?

91
00:06:17,180 --> 00:06:22,940
The answer for Africa is easy—continent wide, the average in 1990 was 93%, compared

92
00:06:22,940 --> 00:06:25,100
to today's 79%.

93
00:06:25,100 --> 00:06:30,620
Their dependency ratio is falling, but this is like the 2D view of this demographic shift.

94
00:06:30,620 --> 00:06:36,500
What's even more useful is the 3D view—the population pyramid.

95
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:41,180
These graphs are simple—each row represents a five-year age bracket, with the left side

96
00:06:41,180 --> 00:06:45,980
indicating the size of the male population in that bracket, and the right side the female

97
00:06:45,980 --> 00:06:46,980
population.

98
00:06:46,980 --> 00:06:51,180
Africa's pyramid indicates that the continent has a disproportionately young population,

99
00:06:51,180 --> 00:06:53,780
which is common for less-developed regions.

100
00:06:53,780 --> 00:06:58,860
Meanwhile, Europe's population pyramid, like those of many more-developed regions,

101
00:06:58,860 --> 00:07:04,220
indicates that its population is disproportionately middle-aged as it ages and birth rates decline.

102
00:07:04,220 --> 00:07:09,620
Now, China's pyramid is undoubtedly affected by the impact of its one-child policy, but

103
00:07:09,620 --> 00:07:14,900
looking at its progression since 1950, it demonstrates a powerful phenomenon.

104
00:07:14,900 --> 00:07:20,820
Through the 50s and 60s, birth rates are higher, meaning a large youth population arises.

105
00:07:20,860 --> 00:07:26,580
Then, starting in the 70s, birth rates decline, but the large youth population is still alive

106
00:07:26,580 --> 00:07:28,660
and moves into working age.

107
00:07:28,660 --> 00:07:32,980
This population bubble moves up the pyramid, creating a situation where there is a huge

108
00:07:32,980 --> 00:07:38,660
working age population, and very few youth or seniors that this population has to support.

109
00:07:38,660 --> 00:07:45,200
By 2010, this pushed China's dependency ratio down to just 36%, almost unprecedentedly

110
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:47,380
low for a large economy.

111
00:07:47,380 --> 00:07:52,820
In fact, today, the only countries with a lower dependency ratio are small nations like

112
00:07:52,820 --> 00:07:58,020
Qatar, the UAE, or Singapore, which have high immigrant labor populations that grow up and

113
00:07:58,020 --> 00:08:01,860
retire in their home countries, thereby skewing the statistics.

114
00:08:01,860 --> 00:08:07,460
Now, China's dependency ratio has since creeped up to 42%, as this Belgian population

115
00:08:07,460 --> 00:08:12,260
from the 50s and 60s has started to move into retirement age, becoming dependent once again,

116
00:08:12,260 --> 00:08:16,900
but the time period with the lowest dependency ratio corresponds well with the period in

117
00:08:16,900 --> 00:08:20,460
which the country experienced the most dramatic economic growth.

118
00:08:20,460 --> 00:08:27,100
One study found that China can attribute 9.2% of its economic growth between 1960 and 2000

119
00:08:27,100 --> 00:08:29,180
to this bulge in the working age population.

120
00:08:29,180 --> 00:08:33,980
That's a small percent in isolation, but in the context of the complexities of national

121
00:08:33,980 --> 00:08:36,340
development, massive.

122
00:08:36,340 --> 00:08:41,060
At the simplest level, people and the government could invest money into growth, rather than

123
00:08:41,060 --> 00:08:45,700
social support for the young and old, which helped accelerate development.

124
00:08:45,700 --> 00:08:50,740
The economic boost that ensues from this short-term population bulge has a name—it's

125
00:08:50,740 --> 00:08:53,540
called the demographic dividend.

126
00:08:53,540 --> 00:08:58,620
Estimates indicate a demographic dividend is coming for Africa as its birth rates decline,

127
00:08:58,620 --> 00:09:01,780
but potentially one less pronounced than China's.

128
00:09:01,780 --> 00:09:08,180
Current population projections would put Africa's 2050 dependency ratio at 60.7%, certainly

129
00:09:08,180 --> 00:09:15,060
a significant improvement from today's 79%, but a far cry from China's 36% low point.

130
00:09:15,100 --> 00:09:22,260
In fact, that dependency ratio is higher than today's world average, which sits at 54.5%.

131
00:09:22,260 --> 00:09:25,500
The future is not, however, set in stone.

132
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:30,860
Now, the demographic dividend typically isn't, as some might speculate, a byproduct of development

133
00:09:30,860 --> 00:09:31,860
itself.

134
00:09:31,860 --> 00:09:36,860
It's well established that birth rates fall in step with development, but recent research

135
00:09:36,860 --> 00:09:43,480
suggests that the strongest trigger for a demographic dividend is, in fact, education.

136
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:46,720
Women have fewer children when they are better educated.

137
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:51,760
Currently, Africa's average secondary school enrollment by women as a proportion of total

138
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:57,080
female population of secondary school age is 48.56%.

139
00:09:57,080 --> 00:10:02,640
China first attained that level in 1977, before it briefly dipped as a result of the abandonment

140
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:05,480
of Cultural Revolution-era education policies.

141
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:11,240
Now, of course, improved education often comes with development, meaning the three factors

142
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:12,980
work in cycle.

143
00:10:12,980 --> 00:10:17,220
Lower education leads to a lower dependency ratio, which leads to faster development,

144
00:10:17,220 --> 00:10:20,780
which leads to better education, and so on and so forth.

145
00:10:20,780 --> 00:10:26,300
Beyond the dividend, Africa's current demographic status, relative to China's, can be further

146
00:10:26,300 --> 00:10:27,300
corroborated.

147
00:10:27,300 --> 00:10:32,860
For example, the continent's average fertility rate is closest to China's in 1974, its

148
00:10:32,860 --> 00:10:38,980
life expectancy parallels China's in 1976, infant fatality rate 1981, and literacy rate

149
00:10:38,980 --> 00:10:40,620
1982.

150
00:10:40,620 --> 00:10:45,620
Looking at this timeline, with the addition of the earlier economic indicators, two defined

151
00:10:45,620 --> 00:10:50,780
clusters appear—the demographic indicators and the economic indicators.

152
00:10:50,780 --> 00:10:53,300
Economically, Africa's in the 2000s.

153
00:10:53,300 --> 00:10:56,540
Demographically, it's in the 70s.

154
00:10:56,540 --> 00:11:00,420
Of course there's a big wide world of chance and circumstance out there that can get in

155
00:11:00,420 --> 00:11:05,300
the way, and this is a narrow way of analyzing economic prospects in the first place, but

156
00:11:05,300 --> 00:11:09,980
this narrow method does present two primary conclusions.

157
00:11:10,340 --> 00:11:14,500
First, Africa is primed for development.

158
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:19,320
In all quantifiable ways, the continent is in a similar or better position than when

159
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:23,740
China began its period of explosive growth in the 70s and 80s.

160
00:11:23,740 --> 00:11:27,860
This isn't to say the growth will inevitably happen, but it is to say that there's nothing

161
00:11:27,860 --> 00:11:33,900
in the indexes that suggests that the continent, on average, isn't ready or capable of starting

162
00:11:33,900 --> 00:11:35,260
that growth.

163
00:11:35,260 --> 00:11:40,660
In fact, there's everything to suggest that Africa is in the exact right situation for

164
00:11:40,660 --> 00:11:43,820
a similar manner of growth to start.

165
00:11:43,820 --> 00:11:50,260
However, secondly, the gap between economic and demographic indicators should raise red

166
00:11:50,260 --> 00:11:51,520
flags.

167
00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:57,520
It suggests that what's holding growth back, if anything, is not the economic situation

168
00:11:57,520 --> 00:12:00,860
of Africa—it's the state of the population.

169
00:12:00,860 --> 00:12:05,720
The indexes are, in aggregate, headed in the right direction, but if African countries

170
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:10,580
want to reap the explosive growth benefits of a demographic dividend, they have to concentrate

171
00:12:10,580 --> 00:12:14,980
on measures to improve family planning, keep more young girls in school, and bring more

172
00:12:14,980 --> 00:12:16,860
women into the workforce.

173
00:12:16,860 --> 00:12:19,880
As much as these measures might seem like one's done because it's the right thing

174
00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:23,940
to do, because improving gender equity is a positive for a country's international

175
00:12:23,940 --> 00:12:29,180
image, the demographic dividend proves that they cause tangible, significant economic

176
00:12:29,180 --> 00:12:31,020
effects downstream.

177
00:12:31,020 --> 00:12:35,200
Going back to this cycle—better education causing lower dependency ratios causing faster

178
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:39,820
development—what is the easiest phase in the cycle to affect?

179
00:12:39,820 --> 00:12:44,820
A country can't just speed up development by itself—that's the end goal, but not

180
00:12:44,820 --> 00:12:48,060
a factor that a country can directly manipulate.

181
00:12:48,060 --> 00:12:51,960
Dependency ratios are easier for a country to affect, but measures like China's one-child

182
00:12:51,960 --> 00:12:56,500
policy are viewed as draconian and often difficult to implement.

183
00:12:56,500 --> 00:13:01,160
Early family planning programs have seen success in certain countries, but are undoubtedly

184
00:13:01,160 --> 00:13:02,580
complex.

185
00:13:02,580 --> 00:13:08,540
The easiest phase in this cycle to manipulate is education, because, by its very nature,

186
00:13:08,540 --> 00:13:12,540
it's something that the country's government manages.

187
00:13:12,540 --> 00:13:17,380
The demographic dividend isn't some silver bullet for explosive development.

188
00:13:17,380 --> 00:13:23,740
Rather, it's one small, yet powerful example of the merits of investing in people.

189
00:13:23,740 --> 00:13:27,860
It's an example backing up the suggestion that Africa's economies should not be focusing

190
00:13:27,860 --> 00:13:32,220
all their attention on using foreign direct investment inflows by courting superpowers

191
00:13:32,220 --> 00:13:34,500
for development projects, for example.

192
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:39,020
That's important, but so is just getting kids in school, getting households hooked

193
00:13:39,020 --> 00:13:43,660
up to electricity, getting people to participate in elections—improving people's quality

194
00:13:43,660 --> 00:13:47,860
of life matters far beyond just quality of life.

195
00:13:47,860 --> 00:13:51,980
So, is Africa the next China?

196
00:13:51,980 --> 00:13:54,260
Well, probably not.

197
00:13:54,260 --> 00:14:00,620
Despite the parallels, China is made up of one country—Africa, 54.

198
00:14:00,620 --> 00:14:06,940
China got things right once—Africa is unlikely to get things right 54 times.

199
00:14:06,940 --> 00:14:11,300
The data suggests that in aggregate the conditions are ripe for development, but there's still

200
00:14:11,300 --> 00:14:13,100
work to do.

201
00:14:13,100 --> 00:14:17,380
Some countries will put in that work and trigger a gold rush, while others will not.

202
00:14:17,380 --> 00:14:21,640
The others will eventually realize their fault and start to catch up, but this means that

203
00:14:21,640 --> 00:14:26,100
the fate of the continent will likely become less and less intertwined.

204
00:14:26,100 --> 00:14:30,320
By century's end, certain African economies will almost certainly be talked about the

205
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:35,520
way China is discussed today, but the disconnected nature of the development process will likely

206
00:14:35,520 --> 00:14:40,040
mean that the global impact of this transformation will be less intense.

207
00:14:40,040 --> 00:14:44,160
That being said, the conditions are there, and the time is right.

208
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:48,440
By recognizing their shortcomings and focusing on human development, Africa might not be

209
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:54,040
the next China, but African countries just might be.

210
00:14:54,040 --> 00:14:59,080
If you've sat through all that talk of indexes and demographics and development, you clearly

211
00:14:59,080 --> 00:15:02,080
enjoy learning about how the world works.

212
00:15:02,080 --> 00:15:07,240
I obviously do too, and one way I do that is to start my day not by browsing Twitter

213
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:12,300
or TikTok, but by reading through Morning Brew's free daily newsletter.

214
00:15:12,300 --> 00:15:16,060
It always arrives in my inbox before I wake up, and catches me up to speed on the most

215
00:15:16,060 --> 00:15:20,900
relevant stories in business, finance, and tech in a witty, informative style that's

216
00:15:20,900 --> 00:15:23,180
far more readable than traditional news.

217
00:15:23,180 --> 00:15:27,140
For example, this morning I was reading about the Democratic Party's proposed billionaire's

218
00:15:27,140 --> 00:15:31,660
tax, why college enrollment is falling in the US, and how 3D printed houses could be

219
00:15:31,660 --> 00:15:35,140
a solution to the construction industry's labor shortage.

220
00:15:35,140 --> 00:15:39,500
Following the news consistently is just about the best way to become better informed, and

221
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:43,940
Morning Brew just makes it so easy, especially considering their newsletter is free.

222
00:15:43,940 --> 00:15:48,180
Seriously, it's not a free trial, not a discount, just a free newsletter, so give

223
00:15:48,180 --> 00:15:51,780
