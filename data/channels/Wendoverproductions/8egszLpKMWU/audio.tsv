11040	17440	In our lifetimes, the dominant story of economic explosion has been that of China.
17440	21760	Previously, it was a poor, vast, peripheral country.
21760	26680	In mere decades, though, its growth has pulled it to center stage, and the country now plays
26680	29660	a serious role in world affairs.
29660	34860	At the core of that transformation now behind us, however, many have asked the question,
34860	36660	who's next?
36660	42160	Which corner of the world is set for a similar, dramatic rise in the coming years?
42160	47100	Plenty of candidates come up, but one of the most frequently floated names is Africa.
47100	52860	It's a continent with a huge population, but a generally lower level of economic development.
52860	58740	It's a region that often, in many ways, falls behind, but that means the only direction
58740	60380	to go is up.
60380	67020	So, is the African continent poised to become the next China—the next darling of the world
67020	68500	economy?
68500	73980	Africa is a sprawling continent three times the size of Europe, composed of 54 countries,
73980	79500	1.4 billion people, and countless religions, languages, ethnic groups, and cultures.
79500	84380	Many appropriately criticize media when they overzealously refer to the continent as one,
84380	87940	generalizing what's happening in part of the continent to its entirety, but there is
87940	92980	logic and precedent for examining Africa as a cohesive unit from an economic lens,
92980	93980	at least.
93980	98440	For the purposes of simplicity, economists and journalists often group related countries
98440	100780	together into business regions.
100780	105580	For example, often, economists will look at the European economy as a whole since France's
105580	110420	economy, for example, is deeply interwoven with Germany's, so their fates are essentially
110420	111420	tied.
111420	115460	Meanwhile, they'll often look at China by itself since it's large enough to be analogous
115460	120140	to Europe, but also unique and isolated enough economically that grouping it with Japan,
120140	125140	for example, would not be appropriate—Japan can prosper when China does not, and vice
125140	126140	versa.
126140	131020	That's why China is worth examining on its own while Africa is examined as a whole.
131020	135420	The countries that compose the continent are economically interlinked and add up to a population
135420	137380	comparable to China's.
137380	142980	Therefore, in this context, one could expect that the development potential of Africa could
142980	146100	be roughly akin to that of China.
146100	148180	But we can quantify this.
148180	153700	The African continent's current gross domestic product is $2.69 trillion.
153700	161260	China's GDP in 2006 was, inflation adjusted, $2.89 trillion, meaning the African economy
161260	165620	today is roughly analogous to that of 2006 China.
165620	170700	This is backed up by the fact that Africa's GDP per capita is currently $2,030, while
170700	173460	in 2006 China's was $2,100.
173460	178100	Africa's urbanization rate is roughly equal to China's in 2008, while their foreign
178100	182460	direct investment inflows are about the same as China's in 1992.
182460	187540	All around, these four important economic development indicators suggest that Africa
187540	191380	stands roughly 20 years behind today's China.
191380	197300	Now, it would be staggering if this were the case—if in a mere two decades, the African
197300	200580	economy would be as relevant as China's today.
200580	205360	Of course, some would have said the same about China decades ago, but economic indicators
205360	211740	are often, counterintuitively, not the most helpful in determining economic growth prospects.
211740	215220	China did not grow off of natural resources.
215220	219820	So too, Africa is not likely to grow off of natural resources.
219820	224440	Both have extensive resources, but economists have observed a phenomenon globally that they
224440	226940	refer to as the resource curse.
226980	232600	Essentially, an abundance of natural resources does not regularly translate well into sustainable
232600	234060	economic growth.
234060	238780	The reasons behind this are hotly contested and quite complex, but one of the simpler
238780	243740	contributing factors is the tendency of resource-based economies to concentrate wealth to a select
243740	244740	few.
244740	248740	While a diamond mine owner might grow rich, the workers in the mine aren't learning
248740	252940	any skills that they can use to innovate, start their own business, and grow the economy.
252940	257300	They just aren't getting educated, and there's no direct incentive on a national
257300	261560	level to improve formal education, since the money that's being made is through jobs
261560	264620	that do not require a high level of education.
264620	269740	In the case of China, manufacturing, which was a major driving force behind its development,
269740	274100	gave many the skills needed to start their own businesses, and there is now a significant,
274100	278740	homegrown tech sector in China that's helping to carry its economy beyond manufacturing.
278740	284540	So, if Africa's going to have a China-style economic explosion, it's going to be because
284540	288020	of human capital, rather than natural resources.
288020	292880	However, that's where the story gets less optimistic.
292880	296860	One relevant demographic indicator is the dependency ratio.
296860	302200	That's a number calculated by dividing the population 14 and under or 65 and over by
302200	304100	the population between those ages.
304620	309280	While it's not perfect, it's a rough index of how many people each working person in
309280	313940	an economy has to support—either directly or through welfare systems.
313940	319380	Now, in general, lower dependency ratios are better for an economy—having less people
319380	324860	to support and a greater percent of people working is financially beneficial—and correspondently,
324860	328620	most developed economies have low dependency ratios.
328620	334700	The US, for example, has a dependency ratio of 54%, indicating that for every 10 working-age
334700	337100	people, there are 5.4 dependents.
337100	342780	Africa's, meanwhile, is 79%—far higher, largely due to the large youth population
342780	345540	in many of the continent's countries.
345540	351100	That puts this metric closest to China's in 1974, before their dependency ratio plummeted
351100	355740	in step with falling birth rates, as the country started to encourage then mandate one child
355740	356740	per couple.
356740	363320	So, this demographic indicator is, relative to China's, far behind chronologically compared
363320	365820	to the earlier economic indicators.
365820	370700	But as important as the current state of the dependency ratio is to an economy, a stronger
370700	376180	predictor of the future is the trend—is the ratio rising, falling, or staying the
376180	377180	same?
377180	382940	The answer for Africa is easy—continent wide, the average in 1990 was 93%, compared
382940	385100	to today's 79%.
385100	390620	Their dependency ratio is falling, but this is like the 2D view of this demographic shift.
390620	396500	What's even more useful is the 3D view—the population pyramid.
396500	401180	These graphs are simple—each row represents a five-year age bracket, with the left side
401180	405980	indicating the size of the male population in that bracket, and the right side the female
405980	406980	population.
406980	411180	Africa's pyramid indicates that the continent has a disproportionately young population,
411180	413780	which is common for less-developed regions.
413780	418860	Meanwhile, Europe's population pyramid, like those of many more-developed regions,
418860	424220	indicates that its population is disproportionately middle-aged as it ages and birth rates decline.
424220	429620	Now, China's pyramid is undoubtedly affected by the impact of its one-child policy, but
429620	434900	looking at its progression since 1950, it demonstrates a powerful phenomenon.
434900	440820	Through the 50s and 60s, birth rates are higher, meaning a large youth population arises.
440860	446580	Then, starting in the 70s, birth rates decline, but the large youth population is still alive
446580	448660	and moves into working age.
448660	452980	This population bubble moves up the pyramid, creating a situation where there is a huge
452980	458660	working age population, and very few youth or seniors that this population has to support.
458660	465200	By 2010, this pushed China's dependency ratio down to just 36%, almost unprecedentedly
465200	467380	low for a large economy.
467380	472820	In fact, today, the only countries with a lower dependency ratio are small nations like
472820	478020	Qatar, the UAE, or Singapore, which have high immigrant labor populations that grow up and
478020	481860	retire in their home countries, thereby skewing the statistics.
481860	487460	Now, China's dependency ratio has since creeped up to 42%, as this Belgian population
487460	492260	from the 50s and 60s has started to move into retirement age, becoming dependent once again,
492260	496900	but the time period with the lowest dependency ratio corresponds well with the period in
496900	500460	which the country experienced the most dramatic economic growth.
500460	507100	One study found that China can attribute 9.2% of its economic growth between 1960 and 2000
507100	509180	to this bulge in the working age population.
509180	513980	That's a small percent in isolation, but in the context of the complexities of national
513980	516340	development, massive.
516340	521060	At the simplest level, people and the government could invest money into growth, rather than
521060	525700	social support for the young and old, which helped accelerate development.
525700	530740	The economic boost that ensues from this short-term population bulge has a name—it's
530740	533540	called the demographic dividend.
533540	538620	Estimates indicate a demographic dividend is coming for Africa as its birth rates decline,
538620	541780	but potentially one less pronounced than China's.
541780	548180	Current population projections would put Africa's 2050 dependency ratio at 60.7%, certainly
548180	555060	a significant improvement from today's 79%, but a far cry from China's 36% low point.
555100	562260	In fact, that dependency ratio is higher than today's world average, which sits at 54.5%.
562260	565500	The future is not, however, set in stone.
565500	570860	Now, the demographic dividend typically isn't, as some might speculate, a byproduct of development
570860	571860	itself.
571860	576860	It's well established that birth rates fall in step with development, but recent research
576860	583480	suggests that the strongest trigger for a demographic dividend is, in fact, education.
583480	586720	Women have fewer children when they are better educated.
586720	591760	Currently, Africa's average secondary school enrollment by women as a proportion of total
591760	597080	female population of secondary school age is 48.56%.
597080	602640	China first attained that level in 1977, before it briefly dipped as a result of the abandonment
602640	605480	of Cultural Revolution-era education policies.
605480	611240	Now, of course, improved education often comes with development, meaning the three factors
611240	612980	work in cycle.
612980	617220	Lower education leads to a lower dependency ratio, which leads to faster development,
617220	620780	which leads to better education, and so on and so forth.
620780	626300	Beyond the dividend, Africa's current demographic status, relative to China's, can be further
626300	627300	corroborated.
627300	632860	For example, the continent's average fertility rate is closest to China's in 1974, its
632860	638980	life expectancy parallels China's in 1976, infant fatality rate 1981, and literacy rate
638980	640620	1982.
640620	645620	Looking at this timeline, with the addition of the earlier economic indicators, two defined
645620	650780	clusters appear—the demographic indicators and the economic indicators.
650780	653300	Economically, Africa's in the 2000s.
653300	656540	Demographically, it's in the 70s.
656540	660420	Of course there's a big wide world of chance and circumstance out there that can get in
660420	665300	the way, and this is a narrow way of analyzing economic prospects in the first place, but
665300	669980	this narrow method does present two primary conclusions.
670340	674500	First, Africa is primed for development.
674500	679320	In all quantifiable ways, the continent is in a similar or better position than when
679320	683740	China began its period of explosive growth in the 70s and 80s.
683740	687860	This isn't to say the growth will inevitably happen, but it is to say that there's nothing
687860	693900	in the indexes that suggests that the continent, on average, isn't ready or capable of starting
693900	695260	that growth.
695260	700660	In fact, there's everything to suggest that Africa is in the exact right situation for
700660	703820	a similar manner of growth to start.
703820	710260	However, secondly, the gap between economic and demographic indicators should raise red
710260	711520	flags.
711520	717520	It suggests that what's holding growth back, if anything, is not the economic situation
717520	720860	of Africa—it's the state of the population.
720860	725720	The indexes are, in aggregate, headed in the right direction, but if African countries
725720	730580	want to reap the explosive growth benefits of a demographic dividend, they have to concentrate
730580	734980	on measures to improve family planning, keep more young girls in school, and bring more
734980	736860	women into the workforce.
736860	739880	As much as these measures might seem like one's done because it's the right thing
739880	743940	to do, because improving gender equity is a positive for a country's international
743940	749180	image, the demographic dividend proves that they cause tangible, significant economic
749180	751020	effects downstream.
751020	755200	Going back to this cycle—better education causing lower dependency ratios causing faster
755200	759820	development—what is the easiest phase in the cycle to affect?
759820	764820	A country can't just speed up development by itself—that's the end goal, but not
764820	768060	a factor that a country can directly manipulate.
768060	771960	Dependency ratios are easier for a country to affect, but measures like China's one-child
771960	776500	policy are viewed as draconian and often difficult to implement.
776500	781160	Early family planning programs have seen success in certain countries, but are undoubtedly
781160	782580	complex.
782580	788540	The easiest phase in this cycle to manipulate is education, because, by its very nature,
788540	792540	it's something that the country's government manages.
792540	797380	The demographic dividend isn't some silver bullet for explosive development.
797380	803740	Rather, it's one small, yet powerful example of the merits of investing in people.
803740	807860	It's an example backing up the suggestion that Africa's economies should not be focusing
807860	812220	all their attention on using foreign direct investment inflows by courting superpowers
812220	814500	for development projects, for example.
814500	819020	That's important, but so is just getting kids in school, getting households hooked
819020	823660	up to electricity, getting people to participate in elections—improving people's quality
823660	827860	of life matters far beyond just quality of life.
827860	831980	So, is Africa the next China?
831980	834260	Well, probably not.
834260	840620	Despite the parallels, China is made up of one country—Africa, 54.
840620	846940	China got things right once—Africa is unlikely to get things right 54 times.
846940	851300	The data suggests that in aggregate the conditions are ripe for development, but there's still
851300	853100	work to do.
853100	857380	Some countries will put in that work and trigger a gold rush, while others will not.
857380	861640	The others will eventually realize their fault and start to catch up, but this means that
861640	866100	the fate of the continent will likely become less and less intertwined.
866100	870320	By century's end, certain African economies will almost certainly be talked about the
870320	875520	way China is discussed today, but the disconnected nature of the development process will likely
875520	880040	mean that the global impact of this transformation will be less intense.
880040	884160	That being said, the conditions are there, and the time is right.
884160	888440	By recognizing their shortcomings and focusing on human development, Africa might not be
888440	894040	the next China, but African countries just might be.
894040	899080	If you've sat through all that talk of indexes and demographics and development, you clearly
899080	902080	enjoy learning about how the world works.
902080	907240	I obviously do too, and one way I do that is to start my day not by browsing Twitter
907240	912300	or TikTok, but by reading through Morning Brew's free daily newsletter.
912300	916060	It always arrives in my inbox before I wake up, and catches me up to speed on the most
916060	920900	relevant stories in business, finance, and tech in a witty, informative style that's
920900	923180	far more readable than traditional news.
923180	927140	For example, this morning I was reading about the Democratic Party's proposed billionaire's
927140	931660	tax, why college enrollment is falling in the US, and how 3D printed houses could be
931660	935140	a solution to the construction industry's labor shortage.
