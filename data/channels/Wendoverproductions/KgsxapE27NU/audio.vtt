00:08.900 --> 00:12.540
The purpose of the Panama Canal is pretty easy to understand.

00:12.540 --> 00:15.180
It turns a journey of this into this.

00:15.180 --> 00:19.580
It brings the US west coast closer to Europe and it brings the US east coast closer to

00:19.580 --> 00:20.680
Asia.

00:20.680 --> 00:26.420
These rather short, 180-foot or 55-meter wide trenches are, combined, perhaps the single

00:26.420 --> 00:29.700
most important and most influential waterway on earth.

00:29.700 --> 00:35.900
That's because the entire shipping industry worldwide is shaped by the Panama Canal.

00:35.900 --> 00:40.260
Hundreds of years ago, the opportunity of a canal across the narrow country of Panama

00:40.260 --> 00:41.580
was identified.

00:41.580 --> 00:46.300
After a few earlier false starts, the Americans went down to Panama in 1903, signed a fairly

00:46.300 --> 00:50.620
dubious treaty granting them land, dammed up a river to make an artificial lake, dug

00:50.620 --> 00:54.620
a trench from that lake to the Pacific, dug a trench from that lake to the Atlantic, and

00:54.620 --> 00:59.820
$13 billion and 5,600 worker fatalities later, the canal was done.

00:59.820 --> 01:04.480
It officially opened the Pacific to the Atlantic on August 15th, 1914 as the first commercial

01:04.480 --> 01:07.100
ship, the SSN Con, sailed through.

01:07.100 --> 01:11.540
Now, the Panama Canal is not just one straight shot from ocean to ocean.

01:11.540 --> 01:16.580
That's because the artificial lake they created, Gadon Lake, is 85 feet or 26 meters

01:16.580 --> 01:17.940
above sea level.

01:17.940 --> 01:23.100
So, cargo ships, which can weigh more than a billion pounds, need to get up those 85

01:23.100 --> 01:28.340
feet or 26 meters and then back down again to transit from ocean to ocean.

01:28.340 --> 01:33.060
Like most canals, to do this, the Panama Canal uses locks.

01:33.060 --> 01:36.540
From the Atlantic side, for example, a ship will be pulled into the first lock by the

01:36.540 --> 01:40.400
tug trains on each side of the canal, the downstream gate will close, water from upstream

01:40.400 --> 01:44.460
will be fed in to fill the lock, the boat will float up, then once the water level rises

01:44.460 --> 01:48.300
to match that of the next lock, the gate will open, and the ship will be pulled into the

01:48.300 --> 01:50.140
next lock.

01:50.140 --> 01:53.740
Then the gates will close, the water level will rise again, the gates will open, then

01:53.740 --> 01:57.520
this will all happen one more time until the third lock raises the ship to the water level

01:57.520 --> 02:01.780
of Gadon Lake—those 85 feet or 26 meters above sea level.

02:01.780 --> 02:06.780
Believe it or not, it is these three locks exclusively that limit what size a large portion

02:06.780 --> 02:09.300
of the world's container ship fleet can be.

02:09.300 --> 02:15.980
A ship has to be under 1,200 feet or 366 meters long and 168 feet or 51 meters wide to be

02:15.980 --> 02:20.620
accepted in the Panama Canal and so a huge proportion of the world's ships are built

02:20.620 --> 02:24.380
to be exactly this size.

02:24.380 --> 02:28.940
This class of ship is called Neo-Panamax or New-Panamax or Post-Panamax depending on who

02:28.940 --> 02:30.160
you ask.

02:30.160 --> 02:34.140
Of course, there are certainly ships larger than the Neo-Panamax size.

02:34.140 --> 02:39.620
The Panama Canal has a size limit of about 15,000 TEU or 20-foot equivalent units.

02:39.620 --> 02:43.900
That's a measure of a ship's capacity based off how many of these 20-foot containers

02:43.900 --> 02:44.900
they could carry.

02:44.900 --> 02:50.500
Now, the largest container ship in existence, the OOCL Hong Kong, has a capacity of over

02:50.500 --> 02:53.180
21,000 TEU.

02:53.180 --> 02:57.740
This ship, like many of those larger than 15,000 TEU, exclusively keeps to the East

02:57.740 --> 03:01.820
Asia to Europe route as it can't efficiently make trips that require transit between the

03:01.820 --> 03:05.220
Pacific and Atlantic since it would have to circumnavigate South America.

03:05.220 --> 03:09.600
But it was really not long ago that the larger ships that could go through the Panama Canal

03:09.600 --> 03:13.540
were far smaller than the current 15,000 TEU size.

03:13.540 --> 03:19.660
You see, up until 2016, the Panama Canal could only fit ships smaller than 5,000 TEU.

03:19.660 --> 03:26.580
That's because up until 2016, these didn't exist—the Panama Canal's new locks.

03:26.580 --> 03:32.020
The old locks can only fit a ship 106 feet or 32 meters wide, but still, given the enormous

03:32.020 --> 03:37.500
importance of this waterway, ships were still then built specifically to fit through.

03:37.500 --> 03:43.020
In fact, 50% of the old locks' users were exactly as wide as this width limit, suggesting

03:43.020 --> 03:46.500
they were likely built for exactly that purpose.

03:46.500 --> 03:52.420
This was a problem for the Panama Canal, though, because believe it or not, the canal has competitors.

03:52.420 --> 03:54.420
It all has to do with geography.

03:54.420 --> 03:58.040
When traveling from East Asia to the US East Coast, which is one of the busiest shipping

03:58.040 --> 04:03.700
routes in the world, it really is not all that much further to go west than east.

04:03.700 --> 04:07.380
Going from Hong Kong to Newark, for example, the distance heading west through the Indian

04:07.380 --> 04:12.040
Ocean, Suez Canal, Mediterranean, and Atlantic is only a few hundred miles or kilometers

04:12.080 --> 04:15.920
longer than going east across the Pacific and through the Panama Canal.

04:15.920 --> 04:19.280
Meanwhile, the Panama Canal is not cheap.

04:19.280 --> 04:24.420
They charge a $90 toll per 20-foot container meaning that most ships, carrying thousands

04:24.420 --> 04:29.780
of loaded containers, pay hundreds of thousands of dollars for just a single transit.

04:29.780 --> 04:33.880
With the new locks in their higher capacity, single ships can possibly be assessed more

04:33.880 --> 04:38.480
than $1 million per transit if they're the largest size fully loaded.

04:38.480 --> 04:41.640
The Suez Canal, meanwhile, typically charges lower tolls.

04:42.240 --> 04:45.820
A ship sailing that Hong Kong to Newark route therefore might choose to take the slightly

04:45.820 --> 04:50.740
longer route via the Suez Canal versus the Panama Canal as, in the end, when you consider

04:50.740 --> 04:53.680
the tolls, it might end up being less expensive.

04:53.680 --> 04:58.360
Now, both canals are constantly changing their fees in order to compete with the other, but

04:58.360 --> 05:04.380
still, throughout the past decade, the Suez Canal seems to maintain a slight edge in cost.

05:04.380 --> 05:07.820
The Panama Canal's other competitor, though, is trains.

05:07.820 --> 05:12.380
For the crucial East Asia to US East Coast route, going through the Panama Canal, while

05:12.380 --> 05:17.200
much faster than circumnavigating the continent, is still not a direct route.

05:17.200 --> 05:23.100
On the Hong Kong to Newark route, the Panama Canal represents an almost 3,000-mile or 5,000-kilometer

05:23.100 --> 05:27.700
diversion from the alternative—crossing the US by land.

05:27.700 --> 05:32.180
It is pretty standard practice to ship cargo from East Asia to Los Angeles and then load

05:32.180 --> 05:35.260
it up on trains to get it to the US East Coast.

05:35.260 --> 05:38.460
While overall this usually ends up a little more expensive than going through the Panama

05:38.460 --> 05:44.620
Canal, it saves about a week in transit time and, for many shippers, this is worth it.

05:44.620 --> 05:49.460
Trains, with their relatively low cost, represent a considerable competitor to the canal and

05:49.460 --> 05:54.220
it is the competition with these and the Suez Canal that pushed the Panama Canal to make

05:54.220 --> 05:55.220
an expansion.

05:55.220 --> 06:00.340
That's why they spent $5.4 billion to build these bigger locks that could fit larger,

06:00.340 --> 06:02.680
15,000 TEU ships.

06:02.680 --> 06:06.280
This would let more of the world's shipping fleet through and these bigger ships, thanks

06:06.280 --> 06:10.320
to economies of scale, have lower cost per container which helps make the canal more

06:10.320 --> 06:13.800
attractive in comparison to its trains or Suez competition.

06:13.800 --> 06:18.360
Now, this expansion is a great example of the butterfly effect.

06:18.360 --> 06:23.200
In one instance, because the Panama Canal widened its size limit by a few dozen feet,

06:23.200 --> 06:29.200
the state of New Jersey had to spend $1.7 billion to raise a bridge by a few dozen feet.

06:29.200 --> 06:33.160
You see, in order to get to much of the port of Newark, which is one of the largest and

06:33.160 --> 06:36.520
busiest in the US, ships have to pass under the Bayonne Bridge.

06:36.520 --> 06:40.780
As a huge proportion of the shipping traffic to the US east coast goes through the Panama

06:40.780 --> 06:45.520
Canal, before the new set of locks, many of the ships that wanted to use the port of Newark

06:45.520 --> 06:50.400
were the smaller size which could all fit under the Bayonne Bridge sitting at 151 feet

06:50.400 --> 06:53.000
or 46 meters above the water.

06:53.000 --> 06:56.640
With the canal expansion project, though, more ships would start making their way to

06:56.640 --> 07:00.000
Newark that would be too large to fit under the Bayonne Bridge.

07:00.000 --> 07:04.640
Therefore, in order for the port of Newark to stay competitive, they just had to raise

07:04.640 --> 07:06.280
that bridge.

07:06.280 --> 07:11.320
Beyond that, all up and down the US east coast, from Miami to Savannah to Charleston to Baltimore

07:11.320 --> 07:16.080
and to New York, ports quickly spent millions and billions of dollars to build facilities

07:16.080 --> 07:20.640
that would fit the bigger ships in time for the opening of the new canal locks.

07:20.640 --> 07:24.740
Still today, though, many ports on the east coast do not have the depth and facilities

07:24.740 --> 07:27.820
needed to handle these neo-Panamax ships.

07:27.820 --> 07:31.220
This, though, presents an opportunity for the Caribbean.

07:31.220 --> 07:36.780
Deep water ports in the Caribbean are developing themselves into major trans-shipment hubs.

07:36.780 --> 07:41.560
What these are are ports where larger ships, like the largest 15,000 TEU container ships

07:41.560 --> 07:45.860
that can now go through the canal, will unload their cargo, which will then be loaded again

07:45.860 --> 07:50.180
onto smaller ships bound for smaller ports closer to the cargo's destination up and

07:50.180 --> 07:52.240
down the east coast.

07:52.240 --> 07:56.240
Huge amounts of foreign money are flowing into the Caribbean to develop these trans-shipment

07:56.240 --> 07:57.240
hubs.

07:57.240 --> 08:01.880
CMA CGM, a shipping company from France that ranks as the world's third largest, operates

08:01.880 --> 08:03.640
the port of Kingston, Jamaica.

08:03.640 --> 08:08.120
DP World, from the UAE, operates the port of COSEDO in the Dominican Republic.

08:08.120 --> 08:12.460
Meanwhile, the port of Freeport, in the Bahamas, is operated by Hutcheson Port Holdings from

08:12.460 --> 08:13.600
Hong Kong.

08:13.600 --> 08:17.860
All of these companies and more have and continue to focus on expanding these Caribbean ports

08:17.860 --> 08:22.000
to suit the increased traffic making its way through the Panama Canal, into the Caribbean,

08:22.000 --> 08:25.080
and eventually to its destination on the east coast.

08:25.080 --> 08:28.680
Sometime soon, though, something could happen that would be simultaneously great for the

08:28.680 --> 08:31.680
Caribbean ports, but terrible for the Panama Canal.

08:31.680 --> 08:35.600
You see, two countries to the north of Panama is Nicaragua.

08:35.600 --> 08:39.960
By linking both the Atlantic and the Pacific to the large Lake Nicaragua, one could have

08:39.960 --> 08:42.660
another connection between the oceans.

08:42.660 --> 08:46.160
There has been a long history of attempts to build this canal, most recently in the

08:46.160 --> 08:49.600
past decade with a failed scheme by a Chinese billionaire.

08:49.600 --> 08:53.360
Given that this failure was recent, there are no current construction plans, but at

08:53.360 --> 08:58.360
least somewhere, the world is going to need more canal capacity between the Pacific and

08:58.360 --> 08:59.400
the Atlantic.

08:59.400 --> 09:04.540
The shipping industry is growing at a solid rate of about 5% annually and the Panama Canal

09:04.540 --> 09:07.420
can only expand so much.

09:07.420 --> 09:11.260
One issue is that the Panama Canal could literally run out of water.

09:11.260 --> 09:17.820
You see, each time the canal locks open, millions of gallons of water flow out and downstream.

09:18.020 --> 09:22.300
Usually this is not a problem because the lake upstream has enough water, but sometimes,

09:22.300 --> 09:26.420
during periods of reduced rainfall, there just won't be enough water to both release

09:26.420 --> 09:30.260
the amount needed to operate the locks and keep the lake at a deep enough level for the

09:30.260 --> 09:32.220
larger ships to transit.

09:32.220 --> 09:36.900
At these times, which included much of spring 2019, the canal will have to place restrictions

09:36.900 --> 09:41.220
on how much weight cargo ships can carry as this will affect how deep they sit in the

09:41.220 --> 09:42.220
water.

09:42.220 --> 09:45.900
They've attempted to limit the effects of this by installing systems to recapture some

09:45.900 --> 09:49.260
of the water used to operate the locks and there are also potential plans to build an

09:49.260 --> 09:53.740
additional upstream dam to create an additional reservoir, but these problems are only expected

09:53.740 --> 09:58.540
to worsen as climate change exacerbates the severity of droughts in the region.

09:58.540 --> 10:02.200
All told, what happens in Panama affects the world.

10:02.200 --> 10:07.300
If a drought in Panama restricts the throughput of the canal, the world economy will feel

10:07.300 --> 10:08.300
it.

10:08.300 --> 10:11.940
That's because shipping is what connects the world's economy and the Panama Canal

10:11.940 --> 10:15.560
is one of the most important connectors in shipping.

10:15.560 --> 10:20.320
The canal effectively brings the economies on one side closer to those on the other and

10:20.320 --> 10:25.260
so, no matter what happens, it will continue to serve as the world's shortcut.

10:25.260 --> 10:30.060
Now, one of the things that those working at the Panama Canal need to understand is

10:30.060 --> 10:31.980
how water works.

10:31.980 --> 10:36.360
As in, how weather works, how the water cycle works, how tides work—all of these things

10:36.360 --> 10:40.720
are also, though, concepts that you can learn about in Brilliant's Physics of the Everyday

10:40.720 --> 10:41.720
course.

10:41.720 --> 10:45.920
Brilliant is the best place to learn complex things such as physics or really any field

10:45.920 --> 10:47.680
