8900	12540	The purpose of the Panama Canal is pretty easy to understand.
12540	15180	It turns a journey of this into this.
15180	19580	It brings the US west coast closer to Europe and it brings the US east coast closer to
19580	20680	Asia.
20680	26420	These rather short, 180-foot or 55-meter wide trenches are, combined, perhaps the single
26420	29700	most important and most influential waterway on earth.
29700	35900	That's because the entire shipping industry worldwide is shaped by the Panama Canal.
35900	40260	Hundreds of years ago, the opportunity of a canal across the narrow country of Panama
40260	41580	was identified.
41580	46300	After a few earlier false starts, the Americans went down to Panama in 1903, signed a fairly
46300	50620	dubious treaty granting them land, dammed up a river to make an artificial lake, dug
50620	54620	a trench from that lake to the Pacific, dug a trench from that lake to the Atlantic, and
54620	59820	$13 billion and 5,600 worker fatalities later, the canal was done.
59820	64480	It officially opened the Pacific to the Atlantic on August 15th, 1914 as the first commercial
64480	67100	ship, the SSN Con, sailed through.
67100	71540	Now, the Panama Canal is not just one straight shot from ocean to ocean.
71540	76580	That's because the artificial lake they created, Gadon Lake, is 85 feet or 26 meters
76580	77940	above sea level.
77940	83100	So, cargo ships, which can weigh more than a billion pounds, need to get up those 85
83100	88340	feet or 26 meters and then back down again to transit from ocean to ocean.
88340	93060	Like most canals, to do this, the Panama Canal uses locks.
93060	96540	From the Atlantic side, for example, a ship will be pulled into the first lock by the
96540	100400	tug trains on each side of the canal, the downstream gate will close, water from upstream
100400	104460	will be fed in to fill the lock, the boat will float up, then once the water level rises
104460	108300	to match that of the next lock, the gate will open, and the ship will be pulled into the
108300	110140	next lock.
110140	113740	Then the gates will close, the water level will rise again, the gates will open, then
113740	117520	this will all happen one more time until the third lock raises the ship to the water level
117520	121780	of Gadon Lake—those 85 feet or 26 meters above sea level.
121780	126780	Believe it or not, it is these three locks exclusively that limit what size a large portion
126780	129300	of the world's container ship fleet can be.
129300	135980	A ship has to be under 1,200 feet or 366 meters long and 168 feet or 51 meters wide to be
135980	140620	accepted in the Panama Canal and so a huge proportion of the world's ships are built
140620	144380	to be exactly this size.
144380	148940	This class of ship is called Neo-Panamax or New-Panamax or Post-Panamax depending on who
148940	150160	you ask.
150160	154140	Of course, there are certainly ships larger than the Neo-Panamax size.
154140	159620	The Panama Canal has a size limit of about 15,000 TEU or 20-foot equivalent units.
159620	163900	That's a measure of a ship's capacity based off how many of these 20-foot containers
163900	164900	they could carry.
164900	170500	Now, the largest container ship in existence, the OOCL Hong Kong, has a capacity of over
170500	173180	21,000 TEU.
173180	177740	This ship, like many of those larger than 15,000 TEU, exclusively keeps to the East
177740	181820	Asia to Europe route as it can't efficiently make trips that require transit between the
181820	185220	Pacific and Atlantic since it would have to circumnavigate South America.
185220	189600	But it was really not long ago that the larger ships that could go through the Panama Canal
189600	193540	were far smaller than the current 15,000 TEU size.
193540	199660	You see, up until 2016, the Panama Canal could only fit ships smaller than 5,000 TEU.
199660	206580	That's because up until 2016, these didn't exist—the Panama Canal's new locks.
206580	212020	The old locks can only fit a ship 106 feet or 32 meters wide, but still, given the enormous
212020	217500	importance of this waterway, ships were still then built specifically to fit through.
217500	223020	In fact, 50% of the old locks' users were exactly as wide as this width limit, suggesting
223020	226500	they were likely built for exactly that purpose.
226500	232420	This was a problem for the Panama Canal, though, because believe it or not, the canal has competitors.
232420	234420	It all has to do with geography.
234420	238040	When traveling from East Asia to the US East Coast, which is one of the busiest shipping
238040	243700	routes in the world, it really is not all that much further to go west than east.
243700	247380	Going from Hong Kong to Newark, for example, the distance heading west through the Indian
247380	252040	Ocean, Suez Canal, Mediterranean, and Atlantic is only a few hundred miles or kilometers
252080	255920	longer than going east across the Pacific and through the Panama Canal.
255920	259280	Meanwhile, the Panama Canal is not cheap.
259280	264420	They charge a $90 toll per 20-foot container meaning that most ships, carrying thousands
264420	269780	of loaded containers, pay hundreds of thousands of dollars for just a single transit.
269780	273880	With the new locks in their higher capacity, single ships can possibly be assessed more
273880	278480	than $1 million per transit if they're the largest size fully loaded.
278480	281640	The Suez Canal, meanwhile, typically charges lower tolls.
282240	285820	A ship sailing that Hong Kong to Newark route therefore might choose to take the slightly
285820	290740	longer route via the Suez Canal versus the Panama Canal as, in the end, when you consider
290740	293680	the tolls, it might end up being less expensive.
293680	298360	Now, both canals are constantly changing their fees in order to compete with the other, but
298360	304380	still, throughout the past decade, the Suez Canal seems to maintain a slight edge in cost.
304380	307820	The Panama Canal's other competitor, though, is trains.
307820	312380	For the crucial East Asia to US East Coast route, going through the Panama Canal, while
312380	317200	much faster than circumnavigating the continent, is still not a direct route.
317200	323100	On the Hong Kong to Newark route, the Panama Canal represents an almost 3,000-mile or 5,000-kilometer
323100	327700	diversion from the alternative—crossing the US by land.
327700	332180	It is pretty standard practice to ship cargo from East Asia to Los Angeles and then load
332180	335260	it up on trains to get it to the US East Coast.
335260	338460	While overall this usually ends up a little more expensive than going through the Panama
338460	344620	Canal, it saves about a week in transit time and, for many shippers, this is worth it.
344620	349460	Trains, with their relatively low cost, represent a considerable competitor to the canal and
349460	354220	it is the competition with these and the Suez Canal that pushed the Panama Canal to make
354220	355220	an expansion.
355220	360340	That's why they spent $5.4 billion to build these bigger locks that could fit larger,
360340	362680	15,000 TEU ships.
362680	366280	This would let more of the world's shipping fleet through and these bigger ships, thanks
366280	370320	to economies of scale, have lower cost per container which helps make the canal more
370320	373800	attractive in comparison to its trains or Suez competition.
373800	378360	Now, this expansion is a great example of the butterfly effect.
378360	383200	In one instance, because the Panama Canal widened its size limit by a few dozen feet,
383200	389200	the state of New Jersey had to spend $1.7 billion to raise a bridge by a few dozen feet.
389200	393160	You see, in order to get to much of the port of Newark, which is one of the largest and
393160	396520	busiest in the US, ships have to pass under the Bayonne Bridge.
396520	400780	As a huge proportion of the shipping traffic to the US east coast goes through the Panama
400780	405520	Canal, before the new set of locks, many of the ships that wanted to use the port of Newark
405520	410400	were the smaller size which could all fit under the Bayonne Bridge sitting at 151 feet
410400	413000	or 46 meters above the water.
413000	416640	With the canal expansion project, though, more ships would start making their way to
416640	420000	Newark that would be too large to fit under the Bayonne Bridge.
420000	424640	Therefore, in order for the port of Newark to stay competitive, they just had to raise
424640	426280	that bridge.
426280	431320	Beyond that, all up and down the US east coast, from Miami to Savannah to Charleston to Baltimore
431320	436080	and to New York, ports quickly spent millions and billions of dollars to build facilities
436080	440640	that would fit the bigger ships in time for the opening of the new canal locks.
440640	444740	Still today, though, many ports on the east coast do not have the depth and facilities
444740	447820	needed to handle these neo-Panamax ships.
447820	451220	This, though, presents an opportunity for the Caribbean.
451220	456780	Deep water ports in the Caribbean are developing themselves into major trans-shipment hubs.
456780	461560	What these are are ports where larger ships, like the largest 15,000 TEU container ships
461560	465860	that can now go through the canal, will unload their cargo, which will then be loaded again
465860	470180	onto smaller ships bound for smaller ports closer to the cargo's destination up and
470180	472240	down the east coast.
472240	476240	Huge amounts of foreign money are flowing into the Caribbean to develop these trans-shipment
476240	477240	hubs.
477240	481880	CMA CGM, a shipping company from France that ranks as the world's third largest, operates
481880	483640	the port of Kingston, Jamaica.
483640	488120	DP World, from the UAE, operates the port of COSEDO in the Dominican Republic.
488120	492460	Meanwhile, the port of Freeport, in the Bahamas, is operated by Hutcheson Port Holdings from
492460	493600	Hong Kong.
493600	497860	All of these companies and more have and continue to focus on expanding these Caribbean ports
497860	502000	to suit the increased traffic making its way through the Panama Canal, into the Caribbean,
502000	505080	and eventually to its destination on the east coast.
505080	508680	Sometime soon, though, something could happen that would be simultaneously great for the
508680	511680	Caribbean ports, but terrible for the Panama Canal.
511680	515600	You see, two countries to the north of Panama is Nicaragua.
515600	519960	By linking both the Atlantic and the Pacific to the large Lake Nicaragua, one could have
519960	522660	another connection between the oceans.
522660	526160	There has been a long history of attempts to build this canal, most recently in the
526160	529600	past decade with a failed scheme by a Chinese billionaire.
529600	533360	Given that this failure was recent, there are no current construction plans, but at
533360	538360	least somewhere, the world is going to need more canal capacity between the Pacific and
538360	539400	the Atlantic.
539400	544540	The shipping industry is growing at a solid rate of about 5% annually and the Panama Canal
544540	547420	can only expand so much.
547420	551260	One issue is that the Panama Canal could literally run out of water.
551260	557820	You see, each time the canal locks open, millions of gallons of water flow out and downstream.
558020	562300	Usually this is not a problem because the lake upstream has enough water, but sometimes,
562300	566420	during periods of reduced rainfall, there just won't be enough water to both release
566420	570260	the amount needed to operate the locks and keep the lake at a deep enough level for the
570260	572220	larger ships to transit.
572220	576900	At these times, which included much of spring 2019, the canal will have to place restrictions
576900	581220	on how much weight cargo ships can carry as this will affect how deep they sit in the
581220	582220	water.
582220	585900	They've attempted to limit the effects of this by installing systems to recapture some
585900	589260	of the water used to operate the locks and there are also potential plans to build an
589260	593740	additional upstream dam to create an additional reservoir, but these problems are only expected
593740	598540	to worsen as climate change exacerbates the severity of droughts in the region.
598540	602200	All told, what happens in Panama affects the world.
602200	607300	If a drought in Panama restricts the throughput of the canal, the world economy will feel
607300	608300	it.
608300	611940	That's because shipping is what connects the world's economy and the Panama Canal
611940	615560	is one of the most important connectors in shipping.
615560	620320	The canal effectively brings the economies on one side closer to those on the other and
620320	625260	so, no matter what happens, it will continue to serve as the world's shortcut.
625260	630060	Now, one of the things that those working at the Panama Canal need to understand is
630060	631980	how water works.
631980	636360	As in, how weather works, how the water cycle works, how tides work—all of these things
636360	640720	are also, though, concepts that you can learn about in Brilliant's Physics of the Everyday
