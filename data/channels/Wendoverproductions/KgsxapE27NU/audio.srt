3
00:00:08,900 --> 00:00:12,540
The purpose of the Panama Canal is pretty easy to understand.

4
00:00:12,540 --> 00:00:15,180
It turns a journey of this into this.

5
00:00:15,180 --> 00:00:19,580
It brings the US west coast closer to Europe and it brings the US east coast closer to

6
00:00:19,580 --> 00:00:20,680
Asia.

7
00:00:20,680 --> 00:00:26,420
These rather short, 180-foot or 55-meter wide trenches are, combined, perhaps the single

8
00:00:26,420 --> 00:00:29,700
most important and most influential waterway on earth.

9
00:00:29,700 --> 00:00:35,900
That's because the entire shipping industry worldwide is shaped by the Panama Canal.

10
00:00:35,900 --> 00:00:40,260
Hundreds of years ago, the opportunity of a canal across the narrow country of Panama

11
00:00:40,260 --> 00:00:41,580
was identified.

12
00:00:41,580 --> 00:00:46,300
After a few earlier false starts, the Americans went down to Panama in 1903, signed a fairly

13
00:00:46,300 --> 00:00:50,620
dubious treaty granting them land, dammed up a river to make an artificial lake, dug

14
00:00:50,620 --> 00:00:54,620
a trench from that lake to the Pacific, dug a trench from that lake to the Atlantic, and

15
00:00:54,620 --> 00:00:59,820
$13 billion and 5,600 worker fatalities later, the canal was done.

16
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:04,480
It officially opened the Pacific to the Atlantic on August 15th, 1914 as the first commercial

17
00:01:04,480 --> 00:01:07,100
ship, the SSN Con, sailed through.

18
00:01:07,100 --> 00:01:11,540
Now, the Panama Canal is not just one straight shot from ocean to ocean.

19
00:01:11,540 --> 00:01:16,580
That's because the artificial lake they created, Gadon Lake, is 85 feet or 26 meters

20
00:01:16,580 --> 00:01:17,940
above sea level.

21
00:01:17,940 --> 00:01:23,100
So, cargo ships, which can weigh more than a billion pounds, need to get up those 85

22
00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:28,340
feet or 26 meters and then back down again to transit from ocean to ocean.

23
00:01:28,340 --> 00:01:33,060
Like most canals, to do this, the Panama Canal uses locks.

24
00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:36,540
From the Atlantic side, for example, a ship will be pulled into the first lock by the

25
00:01:36,540 --> 00:01:40,400
tug trains on each side of the canal, the downstream gate will close, water from upstream

26
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:44,460
will be fed in to fill the lock, the boat will float up, then once the water level rises

27
00:01:44,460 --> 00:01:48,300
to match that of the next lock, the gate will open, and the ship will be pulled into the

28
00:01:48,300 --> 00:01:50,140
next lock.

29
00:01:50,140 --> 00:01:53,740
Then the gates will close, the water level will rise again, the gates will open, then

30
00:01:53,740 --> 00:01:57,520
this will all happen one more time until the third lock raises the ship to the water level

31
00:01:57,520 --> 00:02:01,780
of Gadon Lake—those 85 feet or 26 meters above sea level.

32
00:02:01,780 --> 00:02:06,780
Believe it or not, it is these three locks exclusively that limit what size a large portion

33
00:02:06,780 --> 00:02:09,300
of the world's container ship fleet can be.

34
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:15,980
A ship has to be under 1,200 feet or 366 meters long and 168 feet or 51 meters wide to be

35
00:02:15,980 --> 00:02:20,620
accepted in the Panama Canal and so a huge proportion of the world's ships are built

36
00:02:20,620 --> 00:02:24,380
to be exactly this size.

37
00:02:24,380 --> 00:02:28,940
This class of ship is called Neo-Panamax or New-Panamax or Post-Panamax depending on who

38
00:02:28,940 --> 00:02:30,160
you ask.

39
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:34,140
Of course, there are certainly ships larger than the Neo-Panamax size.

40
00:02:34,140 --> 00:02:39,620
The Panama Canal has a size limit of about 15,000 TEU or 20-foot equivalent units.

41
00:02:39,620 --> 00:02:43,900
That's a measure of a ship's capacity based off how many of these 20-foot containers

42
00:02:43,900 --> 00:02:44,900
they could carry.

43
00:02:44,900 --> 00:02:50,500
Now, the largest container ship in existence, the OOCL Hong Kong, has a capacity of over

44
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:53,180
21,000 TEU.

45
00:02:53,180 --> 00:02:57,740
This ship, like many of those larger than 15,000 TEU, exclusively keeps to the East

46
00:02:57,740 --> 00:03:01,820
Asia to Europe route as it can't efficiently make trips that require transit between the

47
00:03:01,820 --> 00:03:05,220
Pacific and Atlantic since it would have to circumnavigate South America.

48
00:03:05,220 --> 00:03:09,600
But it was really not long ago that the larger ships that could go through the Panama Canal

49
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:13,540
were far smaller than the current 15,000 TEU size.

50
00:03:13,540 --> 00:03:19,660
You see, up until 2016, the Panama Canal could only fit ships smaller than 5,000 TEU.

51
00:03:19,660 --> 00:03:26,580
That's because up until 2016, these didn't exist—the Panama Canal's new locks.

52
00:03:26,580 --> 00:03:32,020
The old locks can only fit a ship 106 feet or 32 meters wide, but still, given the enormous

53
00:03:32,020 --> 00:03:37,500
importance of this waterway, ships were still then built specifically to fit through.

54
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:43,020
In fact, 50% of the old locks' users were exactly as wide as this width limit, suggesting

55
00:03:43,020 --> 00:03:46,500
they were likely built for exactly that purpose.

56
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:52,420
This was a problem for the Panama Canal, though, because believe it or not, the canal has competitors.

57
00:03:52,420 --> 00:03:54,420
It all has to do with geography.

58
00:03:54,420 --> 00:03:58,040
When traveling from East Asia to the US East Coast, which is one of the busiest shipping

59
00:03:58,040 --> 00:04:03,700
routes in the world, it really is not all that much further to go west than east.

60
00:04:03,700 --> 00:04:07,380
Going from Hong Kong to Newark, for example, the distance heading west through the Indian

61
00:04:07,380 --> 00:04:12,040
Ocean, Suez Canal, Mediterranean, and Atlantic is only a few hundred miles or kilometers

62
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:15,920
longer than going east across the Pacific and through the Panama Canal.

63
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:19,280
Meanwhile, the Panama Canal is not cheap.

64
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:24,420
They charge a $90 toll per 20-foot container meaning that most ships, carrying thousands

65
00:04:24,420 --> 00:04:29,780
of loaded containers, pay hundreds of thousands of dollars for just a single transit.

66
00:04:29,780 --> 00:04:33,880
With the new locks in their higher capacity, single ships can possibly be assessed more

67
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:38,480
than $1 million per transit if they're the largest size fully loaded.

68
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:41,640
The Suez Canal, meanwhile, typically charges lower tolls.

69
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:45,820
A ship sailing that Hong Kong to Newark route therefore might choose to take the slightly

70
00:04:45,820 --> 00:04:50,740
longer route via the Suez Canal versus the Panama Canal as, in the end, when you consider

71
00:04:50,740 --> 00:04:53,680
the tolls, it might end up being less expensive.

72
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:58,360
Now, both canals are constantly changing their fees in order to compete with the other, but

73
00:04:58,360 --> 00:05:04,380
still, throughout the past decade, the Suez Canal seems to maintain a slight edge in cost.

74
00:05:04,380 --> 00:05:07,820
The Panama Canal's other competitor, though, is trains.

75
00:05:07,820 --> 00:05:12,380
For the crucial East Asia to US East Coast route, going through the Panama Canal, while

76
00:05:12,380 --> 00:05:17,200
much faster than circumnavigating the continent, is still not a direct route.

77
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:23,100
On the Hong Kong to Newark route, the Panama Canal represents an almost 3,000-mile or 5,000-kilometer

78
00:05:23,100 --> 00:05:27,700
diversion from the alternative—crossing the US by land.

79
00:05:27,700 --> 00:05:32,180
It is pretty standard practice to ship cargo from East Asia to Los Angeles and then load

80
00:05:32,180 --> 00:05:35,260
it up on trains to get it to the US East Coast.

81
00:05:35,260 --> 00:05:38,460
While overall this usually ends up a little more expensive than going through the Panama

82
00:05:38,460 --> 00:05:44,620
Canal, it saves about a week in transit time and, for many shippers, this is worth it.

83
00:05:44,620 --> 00:05:49,460
Trains, with their relatively low cost, represent a considerable competitor to the canal and

84
00:05:49,460 --> 00:05:54,220
it is the competition with these and the Suez Canal that pushed the Panama Canal to make

85
00:05:54,220 --> 00:05:55,220
an expansion.

86
00:05:55,220 --> 00:06:00,340
That's why they spent $5.4 billion to build these bigger locks that could fit larger,

87
00:06:00,340 --> 00:06:02,680
15,000 TEU ships.

88
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:06,280
This would let more of the world's shipping fleet through and these bigger ships, thanks

89
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:10,320
to economies of scale, have lower cost per container which helps make the canal more

90
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:13,800
attractive in comparison to its trains or Suez competition.

91
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:18,360
Now, this expansion is a great example of the butterfly effect.

92
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:23,200
In one instance, because the Panama Canal widened its size limit by a few dozen feet,

93
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:29,200
the state of New Jersey had to spend $1.7 billion to raise a bridge by a few dozen feet.

94
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:33,160
You see, in order to get to much of the port of Newark, which is one of the largest and

95
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:36,520
busiest in the US, ships have to pass under the Bayonne Bridge.

96
00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:40,780
As a huge proportion of the shipping traffic to the US east coast goes through the Panama

97
00:06:40,780 --> 00:06:45,520
Canal, before the new set of locks, many of the ships that wanted to use the port of Newark

98
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:50,400
were the smaller size which could all fit under the Bayonne Bridge sitting at 151 feet

99
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:53,000
or 46 meters above the water.

100
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:56,640
With the canal expansion project, though, more ships would start making their way to

101
00:06:56,640 --> 00:07:00,000
Newark that would be too large to fit under the Bayonne Bridge.

102
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:04,640
Therefore, in order for the port of Newark to stay competitive, they just had to raise

103
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:06,280
that bridge.

104
00:07:06,280 --> 00:07:11,320
Beyond that, all up and down the US east coast, from Miami to Savannah to Charleston to Baltimore

105
00:07:11,320 --> 00:07:16,080
and to New York, ports quickly spent millions and billions of dollars to build facilities

106
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:20,640
that would fit the bigger ships in time for the opening of the new canal locks.

107
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:24,740
Still today, though, many ports on the east coast do not have the depth and facilities

108
00:07:24,740 --> 00:07:27,820
needed to handle these neo-Panamax ships.

109
00:07:27,820 --> 00:07:31,220
This, though, presents an opportunity for the Caribbean.

110
00:07:31,220 --> 00:07:36,780
Deep water ports in the Caribbean are developing themselves into major trans-shipment hubs.

111
00:07:36,780 --> 00:07:41,560
What these are are ports where larger ships, like the largest 15,000 TEU container ships

112
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:45,860
that can now go through the canal, will unload their cargo, which will then be loaded again

113
00:07:45,860 --> 00:07:50,180
onto smaller ships bound for smaller ports closer to the cargo's destination up and

114
00:07:50,180 --> 00:07:52,240
down the east coast.

115
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:56,240
Huge amounts of foreign money are flowing into the Caribbean to develop these trans-shipment

116
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:57,240
hubs.

117
00:07:57,240 --> 00:08:01,880
CMA CGM, a shipping company from France that ranks as the world's third largest, operates

118
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:03,640
the port of Kingston, Jamaica.

119
00:08:03,640 --> 00:08:08,120
DP World, from the UAE, operates the port of COSEDO in the Dominican Republic.

120
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:12,460
Meanwhile, the port of Freeport, in the Bahamas, is operated by Hutcheson Port Holdings from

121
00:08:12,460 --> 00:08:13,600
Hong Kong.

122
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:17,860
All of these companies and more have and continue to focus on expanding these Caribbean ports

123
00:08:17,860 --> 00:08:22,000
to suit the increased traffic making its way through the Panama Canal, into the Caribbean,

124
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:25,080
and eventually to its destination on the east coast.

125
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:28,680
Sometime soon, though, something could happen that would be simultaneously great for the

126
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:31,680
Caribbean ports, but terrible for the Panama Canal.

127
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:35,600
You see, two countries to the north of Panama is Nicaragua.

128
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:39,960
By linking both the Atlantic and the Pacific to the large Lake Nicaragua, one could have

129
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:42,660
another connection between the oceans.

130
00:08:42,660 --> 00:08:46,160
There has been a long history of attempts to build this canal, most recently in the

131
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:49,600
past decade with a failed scheme by a Chinese billionaire.

132
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:53,360
Given that this failure was recent, there are no current construction plans, but at

133
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:58,360
least somewhere, the world is going to need more canal capacity between the Pacific and

134
00:08:58,360 --> 00:08:59,400
the Atlantic.

135
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:04,540
The shipping industry is growing at a solid rate of about 5% annually and the Panama Canal

136
00:09:04,540 --> 00:09:07,420
can only expand so much.

137
00:09:07,420 --> 00:09:11,260
One issue is that the Panama Canal could literally run out of water.

138
00:09:11,260 --> 00:09:17,820
You see, each time the canal locks open, millions of gallons of water flow out and downstream.

139
00:09:18,020 --> 00:09:22,300
Usually this is not a problem because the lake upstream has enough water, but sometimes,

140
00:09:22,300 --> 00:09:26,420
during periods of reduced rainfall, there just won't be enough water to both release

141
00:09:26,420 --> 00:09:30,260
the amount needed to operate the locks and keep the lake at a deep enough level for the

142
00:09:30,260 --> 00:09:32,220
larger ships to transit.

143
00:09:32,220 --> 00:09:36,900
At these times, which included much of spring 2019, the canal will have to place restrictions

144
00:09:36,900 --> 00:09:41,220
on how much weight cargo ships can carry as this will affect how deep they sit in the

145
00:09:41,220 --> 00:09:42,220
water.

146
00:09:42,220 --> 00:09:45,900
They've attempted to limit the effects of this by installing systems to recapture some

147
00:09:45,900 --> 00:09:49,260
of the water used to operate the locks and there are also potential plans to build an

148
00:09:49,260 --> 00:09:53,740
additional upstream dam to create an additional reservoir, but these problems are only expected

149
00:09:53,740 --> 00:09:58,540
to worsen as climate change exacerbates the severity of droughts in the region.

150
00:09:58,540 --> 00:10:02,200
All told, what happens in Panama affects the world.

151
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:07,300
If a drought in Panama restricts the throughput of the canal, the world economy will feel

152
00:10:07,300 --> 00:10:08,300
it.

153
00:10:08,300 --> 00:10:11,940
That's because shipping is what connects the world's economy and the Panama Canal

154
00:10:11,940 --> 00:10:15,560
is one of the most important connectors in shipping.

155
00:10:15,560 --> 00:10:20,320
The canal effectively brings the economies on one side closer to those on the other and

156
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:25,260
so, no matter what happens, it will continue to serve as the world's shortcut.

157
00:10:25,260 --> 00:10:30,060
Now, one of the things that those working at the Panama Canal need to understand is

158
00:10:30,060 --> 00:10:31,980
how water works.

159
00:10:31,980 --> 00:10:36,360
As in, how weather works, how the water cycle works, how tides work—all of these things

160
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:40,720
are also, though, concepts that you can learn about in Brilliant's Physics of the Everyday

161
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:41,720
course.

162
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:45,920
Brilliant is the best place to learn complex things such as physics or really any field

163
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:47,680
of math and science.

164
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:51,600
Not only do they have all their fantastically designed courses, they also have, in the goal

165
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:56,280
of helping you get a little smarter every single day, a series of daily challenges.

166
00:10:56,280 --> 00:11:00,080
In just five minutes, while you're waiting for the subway, the toaster, the doctor, or

167
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:04,380
whatever, you can challenge yourself with one of these and then, if it piques your interest,

168
00:11:04,380 --> 00:11:07,460
each is linked to one of their full-length courses as well.

169
00:11:07,460 --> 00:11:12,080
