12300	18620	Within the walls of the 51 licensed casinos of the Las Vegas Strip, there are 2,879 gaming
18620	25220	tables collectively bringing in $3.1 billion in revenue annually, or over a million dollars
25220	26220	each.
26220	33300	In addition, there are some 38,864 slot machines bringing in another $3.4 billion.
33300	40060	A single large Las Vegas casino, like the Bellagio, makes more annually than some small
40060	41060	countries.
41060	45300	This is because the casino business model is pretty much bulletproof.
45300	49220	Overall, the odds are always in the casino's favor.
49220	54220	If this weren't true, the casino would fail, so these floors just print money.
54220	59280	MGM International, for example, one of the world's largest multinational gaming companies,
59280	65860	has about 2.5 million square feet of casino floor worldwide, meaning it makes, on average,
65860	68500	$1,138 per square foot.
68500	72640	With the money their casinos bring in, they could line every inch of every foot of their
72640	78660	casino floor worldwide with a brand new iPad and still have money left over.
78660	83780	This is all to say, casinos make a lot of money, but to do so, they need a lot more
83780	86340	money coming through their doors.
86340	90400	You see, the casino business model all revolves around risk.
90400	94780	With every game they have, the odds are in their favor, but that's not to say the house
94780	96340	will always win.
96340	101660	Their advantage varies from game to game—in roulette it's about 5.25%, in poker it's
101660	106120	about 3.35%, and in blackjack it's about 0.5%.
106120	110740	Of course, given how tight these margins are, there's a natural variability so casinos
110740	115820	can come out behind on a given table on a given night, but overall, with enough tables
115820	119700	and enough nights, they'll average out to these odds.
119700	125740	However, in order to do so, they need an immense amount of money running through their casinos.
125740	130700	Blackjack, for example, is one of the games with the lowest house edge, so if a casino
130700	135280	wants to earn $1 billion in a given year from the game, which would not be an unreasonable
135280	141080	estimate for a large gaming company like MGM International, they would need $200 billion
141080	143760	changing hands within their doors each year.
143760	147120	$200 billion is an enormous amount of money.
147120	152320	That's pretty much the entire GDP of New Zealand, passing through, in the case of MGM,
152320	156080	a physical structure barely larger than the Empire State Building.
156080	160620	When you have such a rapid throughput of money, very slight changes in the odds can make a
160620	163720	huge dent in the gaming company's earnings.
164080	170120	If, for example, the house edge in Blackjack changed from 0.5% to 0.4%, they would lose
170120	175600	$200 million, assuming $200 billion in annual play.
175600	181280	This is why making sure these odds stay in their favor is so important to casinos—it
181280	184800	can quite literally make or break them.
184800	189120	Despite what pop culture might portray, a casino's biggest problem is not robbers
189120	194840	or hackers or even technically cheaters, because each of those is relatively easy to prevent.
194840	199840	Rather, their biggest problem is people who are able to turn their odds in their favor
199840	203380	without robbing, hacking, or even cheating.
203380	208480	You see, in most common law countries, such as the US, England, Ireland, or Australia,
208480	212740	cheating is legally defined as altering the outcome of the game, acquiring knowledge not
212740	217260	available to all players, or changing one's bet after learning of the outcome.
217260	222920	Cheating in a casino is generally illegal, however, it is possible for a player to consistently
222920	225700	win without cheating.
225700	229920	The best known example of this is card counting—a type of advantage play used in the Blackjack
229920	235620	family of games which is not illegal and, in some cases, is even legally protected.
235620	239280	This advantage play technique essentially takes the basic principles of the game of
239280	244740	Blackjack and uses them against the casino, and these principles are fairly simple.
244740	249580	To start a game, each player bets an amount of money, then six decks of cards are shuffled
249580	252100	together to form what's called the shoe.
252100	257500	Each player is dealt two cards face-up, while the dealer gets one face-up and one face-down.
257500	263080	The goal for all participants is simple—it's to get their cards to total as close to 21
263080	265480	without going above 21.
265480	268400	The execution of that is much tougher.
268400	272280	Starting from the left, each player will either decide to stick with the total they have or
272280	274640	to take another card to add to it.
274640	278000	Of course, the player doesn't know what the next card will be worth—it could be
278000	281920	anything from one to eleven—so it's a gamble on whether it'll make the total go
281920	285160	over 21, in which case their bet is lost.
285160	289720	The higher the original total, the riskier it is to take another card, but there is,
289720	293820	in fact, a mathematically optimal choice for each scenario.
293820	298800	Once every player is done taking cards, or not, the dealer reveals the face-down card
298800	304940	and, automatically, if their total is below 17, they take additional cards until it isn't.
304940	308380	If it's 17 or higher, they leave it as is.
308380	314260	There are then three scenarios—if the dealer goes above 21, all players' bets are doubled,
314260	316960	as long as they didn't go above 21 first.
316960	321120	If a player's total is higher than the dealer's, then the player's bet is doubled.
321120	325480	However, if a player's total is lower, they lose their bet.
325480	329640	Of course, this explanation skipped over plenty of smaller rules and less likely edge
329640	334600	cases, but it is these fundamental elements of gameplay that tie into why card counting
334600	335600	works.
335600	341120	Now, without getting too much into the math, on average, in Blackjack, higher value cards
341120	345100	benefit the player, while lower value cards benefit the dealer.
345100	348980	While the explanation for the higher cards is more complex, lower cards' benefit is
348980	352720	based on the fact that the dealer is required to take additional cards when their total
352720	358060	is less than 17, and so a greater density of lower cards makes it less likely that they'll
358060	361880	go over 21, in which case each player's bet is doubled.
361880	366360	Therefore, if you know that a bunch of low cards are coming, you know that the odds are
366360	370440	against you and so you should reduce your bet or not play.
370440	375680	But, the question is, how do you know it's coming in a randomly shuffled deck?
375680	381640	Well, you perform process of elimination, or, even more simply, you count the cards
381640	382680	you see.
382680	386160	There are hundreds of different forms of card counting that work in hundreds of different
386160	391400	ways, but all are more or less based on what's known as the high-low system.
391400	396280	With this, each card is assigned a value—two through six are assigned one, seven through
396280	401720	nine are assigned zero, and ten, the face cards and the ace, are assigned negative one.
401720	405920	This is based on the fact that, every time a high-value card is dealt, there are fewer
405920	409700	of them left in the deck, which means the odds get worse for the player considering
409700	413340	that high-value cards are better for them, and vice versa.
413340	419680	So, card counting is quite simple—with every card a player sees, they add up its assigned
419680	420680	value.
420680	425060	So, if there are three players and they are dealt these cards, the running count would
425060	431400	be one, plus zero, plus negative one, plus one, plus zero, plus one, plus zero, which
431400	433500	would equal a total of two.
433500	437820	That total of two indicates that the odds have shifted slightly in the player's favor,
437820	442320	while if it were negative two that would indicate the odds were in the dealer's favor.
442320	446480	As play goes on and they get deeper into the deck, the running count will generally increase
446480	450860	in one direction or the other, giving the player more confidence on where the odds stand
450860	455140	and so if, for example, the running count equaled 20, the player would know that the
455140	460100	odds were greatly in their favor and therefore that they should bet big on the next round,
460100	463820	as they have a greater than 50% chance of winning.
463820	467960	This is how people can reliably make money in blackjack.
467960	471460	If a player changed their bet by a factor of 15 depending on the odds, and the dealer
471460	475560	waited until they were through five of the six decks before shuffling, a player, following
475560	483420	perfect blackjack strategy, could earn an advantage of about 1.182% over at the house.
483420	487560	That means that if, assuming a table completes a round of play every minute and the average
487560	495440	bet is around $200, a card counter could profit, on average, about $110 an hour—enough
495440	502120	that some people can and do make a living by sitting at blackjack tables counting cards.
502120	507100	However, considering how simple and reliable this advantage play method is, casinos go
507100	511080	to great lengths to stop it, which is very, very difficult.
511080	517040	That's because the advantage is all in the mind—there's no good way to fully prove
517040	518480	someone's card counting.
518480	523260	Sometimes, people are just lucky, and it's quite a bad look for casinos to kick people
523260	525160	out just because they're winning.
525160	530160	That's why, instead of trying to prove it, most casinos implement rules to try and stop
530160	532640	card counting from working as well.
532640	537020	Remember that, generally, the running count will get further into the positive or negative
537020	541120	the further into the game one goes, because the card counter will have seen more cards
541120	544360	that are now in the discard pile and therefore cannot be dealt.
544360	548920	While a few rounds in the running count might be in the single digits positive or negative,
548920	553440	further on, it'll get into the double digits which gives a counter great confidence on
553440	555680	whether they should bet big or not.
555680	560400	It's towards the end of the shoe—the collection of undeal cards—when card counters really
560400	565280	make their money, so to make it less profitable, casinos can just have their dealers shuffle
565280	566660	earlier on.
566660	571100	If they shuffle four decks deep into the six deck shoe rather than five, that decreases
571100	576180	the player's advantage from 1.182% to just 0.568%.
576180	582120	However, shuffling earlier and more often also cuts into the casino's profits because,
582120	586900	any time the dealer is shuffling, the non-advantaged players aren't playing and losing money,
586900	589580	which is how the casino makes its money.
589580	592940	Another option for casinos is to increase the number of decks they shuffle together
592940	594800	to make the shoe.
594800	599540	Back before card counting first became a widespread issue for casinos, they would play blackjack
599540	603860	with just a single deck of cards, but if they did this today, it would only be a matter
603860	607660	of minutes before a card counter would have high confidence about the odds.
607660	612420	Therefore, they typically now play with six decks shuffled together, which increases the
612420	617900	time it takes to get to high confidence, and, since time is money for a card counter, this
617900	619820	decreases their profits.
619820	624620	Some casinos take this a step further by using continuous shuffle machines.
624620	629380	With no discard pile, there is no increase or decrease in beneficial cards in the shoe,
629380	633540	so card counting is completely ineffective, however, these machines are not yet fully
633540	637260	widespread due to distrust by frequent players.
637260	640760	While these methods deal with stopping or reducing a player's ability to actually
640760	645140	know what the odds are at a given moment, the other method involves stopping a player's
645140	649100	ability to respond to this knowledge by changing the size of their bets.
649100	654220	Essentially, if a dealer or a pit boss suspects someone might be card counting, they'll
654220	657300	change the rules on them and require flat betting.
657300	661180	This is where a player is told to pick one bet size, and then they are not allowed to
661180	663940	change that size from round to round.
663940	668200	Therefore, card counters might know that the odds are changing, but they will not be able
668200	673180	to respond to it with a larger or smaller bet, so the odds will stay in the house's
673180	674180	favour.
674180	678940	However, that poses the question, how do you spot a card counter?
678940	682900	Well, one of the most telltale signs is that they're winning.
682900	686980	Even if someone is card counting, the casino does not care as long as they're losing,
686980	691220	so they don't really pay attention to people until they've made some real money.
691220	695200	Once they are, though, if a pit boss notices that a player, for example, changes their
695200	700140	bet from $100 to $1,000 right before a series of wins or as the shoe is close to finished,
700140	703900	that's a good sign that they know what the odds are.
703900	708940	In addition, professional card counters often start with a very large buy-in—they convert
708940	713000	a lot of money into chips—because there is natural variance on whether or not they
713000	715260	win, even if they know the odds.
715720	720180	They can win infinite money, but they can only lose as much money as they have, and
720180	724540	even if they have an advantage, if they're unlucky and they lose all their money, there's
724540	726260	no way to win it back.
726260	730940	The math works out so that, if you want to win $170 an hour card counting, you need to
730940	737260	have $100,000 in order to only have a 1% chance of running out of money.
737260	742140	In the end, casinos don't need to make it impossible to count cards.
742140	746420	Only a small minority of people will attempt it, and those that do can only make so much
746420	751140	money per hour, so in a way, it's a cost of doing business.
751140	755420	To avoid it making a big dent in their profits, all they need to do is make advantage play
755420	760460	at their tables just a little bit harder than those next door, and if this is the case,
760460	762780	the card counter will go next door.
762780	768820	There will always be an escalating arms race by both players and casinos to gain an advantage
768820	771660	and stop an advantage, respectively.
772180	776800	Mathematics, economics, and human nature combined mean that as long as Blackjack and other flawed
776800	782540	casino games stay popular, players will always find a way to tilt odds ever so slightly in
782540	785140	their favor.
785140	790100	Before I made this video, I took Brilliant's course on casino probability and, specifically,
790100	793900	the section on Blackjack to be sure that I understood most of the math behind what I
793900	794900	was talking about.
794900	799500	In fact, part of the reason why I wanted to make this video was because I found the mathematics
799500	804360	of gambling so interesting, and so, if you did too, this course is a fantastic way to
804360	806340	dive deeper into the topic.
806340	810460	You can even do this one on the go, in small chunks, with their mobile app, or learn something
810460	814660	new every day with their daily challenges, or dive deep into something completely different
