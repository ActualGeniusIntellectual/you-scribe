00:12.300 --> 00:18.620
Within the walls of the 51 licensed casinos of the Las Vegas Strip, there are 2,879 gaming

00:18.620 --> 00:25.220
tables collectively bringing in $3.1 billion in revenue annually, or over a million dollars

00:25.220 --> 00:26.220
each.

00:26.220 --> 00:33.300
In addition, there are some 38,864 slot machines bringing in another $3.4 billion.

00:33.300 --> 00:40.060
A single large Las Vegas casino, like the Bellagio, makes more annually than some small

00:40.060 --> 00:41.060
countries.

00:41.060 --> 00:45.300
This is because the casino business model is pretty much bulletproof.

00:45.300 --> 00:49.220
Overall, the odds are always in the casino's favor.

00:49.220 --> 00:54.220
If this weren't true, the casino would fail, so these floors just print money.

00:54.220 --> 00:59.280
MGM International, for example, one of the world's largest multinational gaming companies,

00:59.280 --> 01:05.860
has about 2.5 million square feet of casino floor worldwide, meaning it makes, on average,

01:05.860 --> 01:08.500
$1,138 per square foot.

01:08.500 --> 01:12.640
With the money their casinos bring in, they could line every inch of every foot of their

01:12.640 --> 01:18.660
casino floor worldwide with a brand new iPad and still have money left over.

01:18.660 --> 01:23.780
This is all to say, casinos make a lot of money, but to do so, they need a lot more

01:23.780 --> 01:26.340
money coming through their doors.

01:26.340 --> 01:30.400
You see, the casino business model all revolves around risk.

01:30.400 --> 01:34.780
With every game they have, the odds are in their favor, but that's not to say the house

01:34.780 --> 01:36.340
will always win.

01:36.340 --> 01:41.660
Their advantage varies from game to game—in roulette it's about 5.25%, in poker it's

01:41.660 --> 01:46.120
about 3.35%, and in blackjack it's about 0.5%.

01:46.120 --> 01:50.740
Of course, given how tight these margins are, there's a natural variability so casinos

01:50.740 --> 01:55.820
can come out behind on a given table on a given night, but overall, with enough tables

01:55.820 --> 01:59.700
and enough nights, they'll average out to these odds.

01:59.700 --> 02:05.740
However, in order to do so, they need an immense amount of money running through their casinos.

02:05.740 --> 02:10.700
Blackjack, for example, is one of the games with the lowest house edge, so if a casino

02:10.700 --> 02:15.280
wants to earn $1 billion in a given year from the game, which would not be an unreasonable

02:15.280 --> 02:21.080
estimate for a large gaming company like MGM International, they would need $200 billion

02:21.080 --> 02:23.760
changing hands within their doors each year.

02:23.760 --> 02:27.120
$200 billion is an enormous amount of money.

02:27.120 --> 02:32.320
That's pretty much the entire GDP of New Zealand, passing through, in the case of MGM,

02:32.320 --> 02:36.080
a physical structure barely larger than the Empire State Building.

02:36.080 --> 02:40.620
When you have such a rapid throughput of money, very slight changes in the odds can make a

02:40.620 --> 02:43.720
huge dent in the gaming company's earnings.

02:44.080 --> 02:50.120
If, for example, the house edge in Blackjack changed from 0.5% to 0.4%, they would lose

02:50.120 --> 02:55.600
$200 million, assuming $200 billion in annual play.

02:55.600 --> 03:01.280
This is why making sure these odds stay in their favor is so important to casinos—it

03:01.280 --> 03:04.800
can quite literally make or break them.

03:04.800 --> 03:09.120
Despite what pop culture might portray, a casino's biggest problem is not robbers

03:09.120 --> 03:14.840
or hackers or even technically cheaters, because each of those is relatively easy to prevent.

03:14.840 --> 03:19.840
Rather, their biggest problem is people who are able to turn their odds in their favor

03:19.840 --> 03:23.380
without robbing, hacking, or even cheating.

03:23.380 --> 03:28.480
You see, in most common law countries, such as the US, England, Ireland, or Australia,

03:28.480 --> 03:32.740
cheating is legally defined as altering the outcome of the game, acquiring knowledge not

03:32.740 --> 03:37.260
available to all players, or changing one's bet after learning of the outcome.

03:37.260 --> 03:42.920
Cheating in a casino is generally illegal, however, it is possible for a player to consistently

03:42.920 --> 03:45.700
win without cheating.

03:45.700 --> 03:49.920
The best known example of this is card counting—a type of advantage play used in the Blackjack

03:49.920 --> 03:55.620
family of games which is not illegal and, in some cases, is even legally protected.

03:55.620 --> 03:59.280
This advantage play technique essentially takes the basic principles of the game of

03:59.280 --> 04:04.740
Blackjack and uses them against the casino, and these principles are fairly simple.

04:04.740 --> 04:09.580
To start a game, each player bets an amount of money, then six decks of cards are shuffled

04:09.580 --> 04:12.100
together to form what's called the shoe.

04:12.100 --> 04:17.500
Each player is dealt two cards face-up, while the dealer gets one face-up and one face-down.

04:17.500 --> 04:23.080
The goal for all participants is simple—it's to get their cards to total as close to 21

04:23.080 --> 04:25.480
without going above 21.

04:25.480 --> 04:28.400
The execution of that is much tougher.

04:28.400 --> 04:32.280
Starting from the left, each player will either decide to stick with the total they have or

04:32.280 --> 04:34.640
to take another card to add to it.

04:34.640 --> 04:38.000
Of course, the player doesn't know what the next card will be worth—it could be

04:38.000 --> 04:41.920
anything from one to eleven—so it's a gamble on whether it'll make the total go

04:41.920 --> 04:45.160
over 21, in which case their bet is lost.

04:45.160 --> 04:49.720
The higher the original total, the riskier it is to take another card, but there is,

04:49.720 --> 04:53.820
in fact, a mathematically optimal choice for each scenario.

04:53.820 --> 04:58.800
Once every player is done taking cards, or not, the dealer reveals the face-down card

04:58.800 --> 05:04.940
and, automatically, if their total is below 17, they take additional cards until it isn't.

05:04.940 --> 05:08.380
If it's 17 or higher, they leave it as is.

05:08.380 --> 05:14.260
There are then three scenarios—if the dealer goes above 21, all players' bets are doubled,

05:14.260 --> 05:16.960
as long as they didn't go above 21 first.

05:16.960 --> 05:21.120
If a player's total is higher than the dealer's, then the player's bet is doubled.

05:21.120 --> 05:25.480
However, if a player's total is lower, they lose their bet.

05:25.480 --> 05:29.640
Of course, this explanation skipped over plenty of smaller rules and less likely edge

05:29.640 --> 05:34.600
cases, but it is these fundamental elements of gameplay that tie into why card counting

05:34.600 --> 05:35.600
works.

05:35.600 --> 05:41.120
Now, without getting too much into the math, on average, in Blackjack, higher value cards

05:41.120 --> 05:45.100
benefit the player, while lower value cards benefit the dealer.

05:45.100 --> 05:48.980
While the explanation for the higher cards is more complex, lower cards' benefit is

05:48.980 --> 05:52.720
based on the fact that the dealer is required to take additional cards when their total

05:52.720 --> 05:58.060
is less than 17, and so a greater density of lower cards makes it less likely that they'll

05:58.060 --> 06:01.880
go over 21, in which case each player's bet is doubled.

06:01.880 --> 06:06.360
Therefore, if you know that a bunch of low cards are coming, you know that the odds are

06:06.360 --> 06:10.440
against you and so you should reduce your bet or not play.

06:10.440 --> 06:15.680
But, the question is, how do you know it's coming in a randomly shuffled deck?

06:15.680 --> 06:21.640
Well, you perform process of elimination, or, even more simply, you count the cards

06:21.640 --> 06:22.680
you see.

06:22.680 --> 06:26.160
There are hundreds of different forms of card counting that work in hundreds of different

06:26.160 --> 06:31.400
ways, but all are more or less based on what's known as the high-low system.

06:31.400 --> 06:36.280
With this, each card is assigned a value—two through six are assigned one, seven through

06:36.280 --> 06:41.720
nine are assigned zero, and ten, the face cards and the ace, are assigned negative one.

06:41.720 --> 06:45.920
This is based on the fact that, every time a high-value card is dealt, there are fewer

06:45.920 --> 06:49.700
of them left in the deck, which means the odds get worse for the player considering

06:49.700 --> 06:53.340
that high-value cards are better for them, and vice versa.

06:53.340 --> 06:59.680
So, card counting is quite simple—with every card a player sees, they add up its assigned

06:59.680 --> 07:00.680
value.

07:00.680 --> 07:05.060
So, if there are three players and they are dealt these cards, the running count would

07:05.060 --> 07:11.400
be one, plus zero, plus negative one, plus one, plus zero, plus one, plus zero, which

07:11.400 --> 07:13.500
would equal a total of two.

07:13.500 --> 07:17.820
That total of two indicates that the odds have shifted slightly in the player's favor,

07:17.820 --> 07:22.320
while if it were negative two that would indicate the odds were in the dealer's favor.

07:22.320 --> 07:26.480
As play goes on and they get deeper into the deck, the running count will generally increase

07:26.480 --> 07:30.860
in one direction or the other, giving the player more confidence on where the odds stand

07:30.860 --> 07:35.140
and so if, for example, the running count equaled 20, the player would know that the

07:35.140 --> 07:40.100
odds were greatly in their favor and therefore that they should bet big on the next round,

07:40.100 --> 07:43.820
as they have a greater than 50% chance of winning.

07:43.820 --> 07:47.960
This is how people can reliably make money in blackjack.

07:47.960 --> 07:51.460
If a player changed their bet by a factor of 15 depending on the odds, and the dealer

07:51.460 --> 07:55.560
waited until they were through five of the six decks before shuffling, a player, following

07:55.560 --> 08:03.420
perfect blackjack strategy, could earn an advantage of about 1.182% over at the house.

08:03.420 --> 08:07.560
That means that if, assuming a table completes a round of play every minute and the average

08:07.560 --> 08:15.440
bet is around $200, a card counter could profit, on average, about $110 an hour—enough

08:15.440 --> 08:22.120
that some people can and do make a living by sitting at blackjack tables counting cards.

08:22.120 --> 08:27.100
However, considering how simple and reliable this advantage play method is, casinos go

08:27.100 --> 08:31.080
to great lengths to stop it, which is very, very difficult.

08:31.080 --> 08:37.040
That's because the advantage is all in the mind—there's no good way to fully prove

08:37.040 --> 08:38.480
someone's card counting.

08:38.480 --> 08:43.260
Sometimes, people are just lucky, and it's quite a bad look for casinos to kick people

08:43.260 --> 08:45.160
out just because they're winning.

08:45.160 --> 08:50.160
That's why, instead of trying to prove it, most casinos implement rules to try and stop

08:50.160 --> 08:52.640
card counting from working as well.

08:52.640 --> 08:57.020
Remember that, generally, the running count will get further into the positive or negative

08:57.020 --> 09:01.120
the further into the game one goes, because the card counter will have seen more cards

09:01.120 --> 09:04.360
that are now in the discard pile and therefore cannot be dealt.

09:04.360 --> 09:08.920
While a few rounds in the running count might be in the single digits positive or negative,

09:08.920 --> 09:13.440
further on, it'll get into the double digits which gives a counter great confidence on

09:13.440 --> 09:15.680
whether they should bet big or not.

09:15.680 --> 09:20.400
It's towards the end of the shoe—the collection of undeal cards—when card counters really

09:20.400 --> 09:25.280
make their money, so to make it less profitable, casinos can just have their dealers shuffle

09:25.280 --> 09:26.660
earlier on.

09:26.660 --> 09:31.100
If they shuffle four decks deep into the six deck shoe rather than five, that decreases

09:31.100 --> 09:36.180
the player's advantage from 1.182% to just 0.568%.

09:36.180 --> 09:42.120
However, shuffling earlier and more often also cuts into the casino's profits because,

09:42.120 --> 09:46.900
any time the dealer is shuffling, the non-advantaged players aren't playing and losing money,

09:46.900 --> 09:49.580
which is how the casino makes its money.

09:49.580 --> 09:52.940
Another option for casinos is to increase the number of decks they shuffle together

09:52.940 --> 09:54.800
to make the shoe.

09:54.800 --> 09:59.540
Back before card counting first became a widespread issue for casinos, they would play blackjack

09:59.540 --> 10:03.860
with just a single deck of cards, but if they did this today, it would only be a matter

10:03.860 --> 10:07.660
of minutes before a card counter would have high confidence about the odds.

10:07.660 --> 10:12.420
Therefore, they typically now play with six decks shuffled together, which increases the

10:12.420 --> 10:17.900
time it takes to get to high confidence, and, since time is money for a card counter, this

10:17.900 --> 10:19.820
decreases their profits.

10:19.820 --> 10:24.620
Some casinos take this a step further by using continuous shuffle machines.

10:24.620 --> 10:29.380
With no discard pile, there is no increase or decrease in beneficial cards in the shoe,

10:29.380 --> 10:33.540
so card counting is completely ineffective, however, these machines are not yet fully

10:33.540 --> 10:37.260
widespread due to distrust by frequent players.

10:37.260 --> 10:40.760
While these methods deal with stopping or reducing a player's ability to actually

10:40.760 --> 10:45.140
know what the odds are at a given moment, the other method involves stopping a player's

10:45.140 --> 10:49.100
ability to respond to this knowledge by changing the size of their bets.

10:49.100 --> 10:54.220
Essentially, if a dealer or a pit boss suspects someone might be card counting, they'll

10:54.220 --> 10:57.300
change the rules on them and require flat betting.

10:57.300 --> 11:01.180
This is where a player is told to pick one bet size, and then they are not allowed to

11:01.180 --> 11:03.940
change that size from round to round.

11:03.940 --> 11:08.200
Therefore, card counters might know that the odds are changing, but they will not be able

11:08.200 --> 11:13.180
to respond to it with a larger or smaller bet, so the odds will stay in the house's

11:13.180 --> 11:14.180
favour.

11:14.180 --> 11:18.940
However, that poses the question, how do you spot a card counter?

11:18.940 --> 11:22.900
Well, one of the most telltale signs is that they're winning.

11:22.900 --> 11:26.980
Even if someone is card counting, the casino does not care as long as they're losing,

11:26.980 --> 11:31.220
so they don't really pay attention to people until they've made some real money.

11:31.220 --> 11:35.200
Once they are, though, if a pit boss notices that a player, for example, changes their

11:35.200 --> 11:40.140
bet from $100 to $1,000 right before a series of wins or as the shoe is close to finished,

11:40.140 --> 11:43.900
that's a good sign that they know what the odds are.

11:43.900 --> 11:48.940
In addition, professional card counters often start with a very large buy-in—they convert

11:48.940 --> 11:53.000
a lot of money into chips—because there is natural variance on whether or not they

11:53.000 --> 11:55.260
win, even if they know the odds.

11:55.720 --> 12:00.180
They can win infinite money, but they can only lose as much money as they have, and

12:00.180 --> 12:04.540
even if they have an advantage, if they're unlucky and they lose all their money, there's

12:04.540 --> 12:06.260
no way to win it back.

12:06.260 --> 12:10.940
The math works out so that, if you want to win $170 an hour card counting, you need to

12:10.940 --> 12:17.260
have $100,000 in order to only have a 1% chance of running out of money.

12:17.260 --> 12:22.140
In the end, casinos don't need to make it impossible to count cards.

12:22.140 --> 12:26.420
Only a small minority of people will attempt it, and those that do can only make so much

12:26.420 --> 12:31.140
money per hour, so in a way, it's a cost of doing business.

12:31.140 --> 12:35.420
To avoid it making a big dent in their profits, all they need to do is make advantage play

12:35.420 --> 12:40.460
at their tables just a little bit harder than those next door, and if this is the case,

12:40.460 --> 12:42.780
the card counter will go next door.

12:42.780 --> 12:48.820
There will always be an escalating arms race by both players and casinos to gain an advantage

12:48.820 --> 12:51.660
and stop an advantage, respectively.

12:52.180 --> 12:56.800
Mathematics, economics, and human nature combined mean that as long as Blackjack and other flawed

12:56.800 --> 13:02.540
casino games stay popular, players will always find a way to tilt odds ever so slightly in

13:02.540 --> 13:05.140
their favor.

13:05.140 --> 13:10.100
Before I made this video, I took Brilliant's course on casino probability and, specifically,

13:10.100 --> 13:13.900
the section on Blackjack to be sure that I understood most of the math behind what I

13:13.900 --> 13:14.900
was talking about.

13:14.900 --> 13:19.500
In fact, part of the reason why I wanted to make this video was because I found the mathematics

13:19.500 --> 13:24.360
of gambling so interesting, and so, if you did too, this course is a fantastic way to

13:24.360 --> 13:26.340
dive deeper into the topic.

13:26.340 --> 13:30.460
You can even do this one on the go, in small chunks, with their mobile app, or learn something

13:30.460 --> 13:34.660
new every day with their daily challenges, or dive deep into something completely different

13:34.660 --> 13:38.540
with any one of their many dozens of super high quality classes.

13:38.540 --> 13:42.100
By high quality, I don't mean that they look good or work smoothly, even though they

13:42.100 --> 13:47.000
definitely do, but rather that their academics are designed in a way that makes rather complicated

13:47.000 --> 13:48.860
subjects easy to learn.

13:48.860 --> 13:53.260
They teach you like the best teacher you've ever had—by breaking up big concepts into

13:53.260 --> 13:55.740
smaller, digestible, intuitive chunks.

13:55.740 --> 14:00.120
So, if you want to dive deep on useful STEM topics, including learning more about the
