00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:18,620
Within the walls of the 51 licensed casinos of the Las Vegas Strip, there are 2,879 gaming

5
00:00:18,620 --> 00:00:25,220
tables collectively bringing in $3.1 billion in revenue annually, or over a million dollars

6
00:00:25,220 --> 00:00:26,220
each.

7
00:00:26,220 --> 00:00:33,300
In addition, there are some 38,864 slot machines bringing in another $3.4 billion.

8
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:40,060
A single large Las Vegas casino, like the Bellagio, makes more annually than some small

9
00:00:40,060 --> 00:00:41,060
countries.

10
00:00:41,060 --> 00:00:45,300
This is because the casino business model is pretty much bulletproof.

11
00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:49,220
Overall, the odds are always in the casino's favor.

12
00:00:49,220 --> 00:00:54,220
If this weren't true, the casino would fail, so these floors just print money.

13
00:00:54,220 --> 00:00:59,280
MGM International, for example, one of the world's largest multinational gaming companies,

14
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:05,860
has about 2.5 million square feet of casino floor worldwide, meaning it makes, on average,

15
00:01:05,860 --> 00:01:08,500
$1,138 per square foot.

16
00:01:08,500 --> 00:01:12,640
With the money their casinos bring in, they could line every inch of every foot of their

17
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:18,660
casino floor worldwide with a brand new iPad and still have money left over.

18
00:01:18,660 --> 00:01:23,780
This is all to say, casinos make a lot of money, but to do so, they need a lot more

19
00:01:23,780 --> 00:01:26,340
money coming through their doors.

20
00:01:26,340 --> 00:01:30,400
You see, the casino business model all revolves around risk.

21
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:34,780
With every game they have, the odds are in their favor, but that's not to say the house

22
00:01:34,780 --> 00:01:36,340
will always win.

23
00:01:36,340 --> 00:01:41,660
Their advantage varies from game to game—in roulette it's about 5.25%, in poker it's

24
00:01:41,660 --> 00:01:46,120
about 3.35%, and in blackjack it's about 0.5%.

25
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:50,740
Of course, given how tight these margins are, there's a natural variability so casinos

26
00:01:50,740 --> 00:01:55,820
can come out behind on a given table on a given night, but overall, with enough tables

27
00:01:55,820 --> 00:01:59,700
and enough nights, they'll average out to these odds.

28
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:05,740
However, in order to do so, they need an immense amount of money running through their casinos.

29
00:02:05,740 --> 00:02:10,700
Blackjack, for example, is one of the games with the lowest house edge, so if a casino

30
00:02:10,700 --> 00:02:15,280
wants to earn $1 billion in a given year from the game, which would not be an unreasonable

31
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:21,080
estimate for a large gaming company like MGM International, they would need $200 billion

32
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:23,760
changing hands within their doors each year.

33
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:27,120
$200 billion is an enormous amount of money.

34
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:32,320
That's pretty much the entire GDP of New Zealand, passing through, in the case of MGM,

35
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:36,080
a physical structure barely larger than the Empire State Building.

36
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:40,620
When you have such a rapid throughput of money, very slight changes in the odds can make a

37
00:02:40,620 --> 00:02:43,720
huge dent in the gaming company's earnings.

38
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:50,120
If, for example, the house edge in Blackjack changed from 0.5% to 0.4%, they would lose

39
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:55,600
$200 million, assuming $200 billion in annual play.

40
00:02:55,600 --> 00:03:01,280
This is why making sure these odds stay in their favor is so important to casinos—it

41
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:04,800
can quite literally make or break them.

42
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:09,120
Despite what pop culture might portray, a casino's biggest problem is not robbers

43
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:14,840
or hackers or even technically cheaters, because each of those is relatively easy to prevent.

44
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:19,840
Rather, their biggest problem is people who are able to turn their odds in their favor

45
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:23,380
without robbing, hacking, or even cheating.

46
00:03:23,380 --> 00:03:28,480
You see, in most common law countries, such as the US, England, Ireland, or Australia,

47
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:32,740
cheating is legally defined as altering the outcome of the game, acquiring knowledge not

48
00:03:32,740 --> 00:03:37,260
available to all players, or changing one's bet after learning of the outcome.

49
00:03:37,260 --> 00:03:42,920
Cheating in a casino is generally illegal, however, it is possible for a player to consistently

50
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:45,700
win without cheating.

51
00:03:45,700 --> 00:03:49,920
The best known example of this is card counting—a type of advantage play used in the Blackjack

52
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:55,620
family of games which is not illegal and, in some cases, is even legally protected.

53
00:03:55,620 --> 00:03:59,280
This advantage play technique essentially takes the basic principles of the game of

54
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:04,740
Blackjack and uses them against the casino, and these principles are fairly simple.

55
00:04:04,740 --> 00:04:09,580
To start a game, each player bets an amount of money, then six decks of cards are shuffled

56
00:04:09,580 --> 00:04:12,100
together to form what's called the shoe.

57
00:04:12,100 --> 00:04:17,500
Each player is dealt two cards face-up, while the dealer gets one face-up and one face-down.

58
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:23,080
The goal for all participants is simple—it's to get their cards to total as close to 21

59
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:25,480
without going above 21.

60
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:28,400
The execution of that is much tougher.

61
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:32,280
Starting from the left, each player will either decide to stick with the total they have or

62
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:34,640
to take another card to add to it.

63
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:38,000
Of course, the player doesn't know what the next card will be worth—it could be

64
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,920
anything from one to eleven—so it's a gamble on whether it'll make the total go

65
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:45,160
over 21, in which case their bet is lost.

66
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:49,720
The higher the original total, the riskier it is to take another card, but there is,

67
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:53,820
in fact, a mathematically optimal choice for each scenario.

68
00:04:53,820 --> 00:04:58,800
Once every player is done taking cards, or not, the dealer reveals the face-down card

69
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:04,940
and, automatically, if their total is below 17, they take additional cards until it isn't.

70
00:05:04,940 --> 00:05:08,380
If it's 17 or higher, they leave it as is.

71
00:05:08,380 --> 00:05:14,260
There are then three scenarios—if the dealer goes above 21, all players' bets are doubled,

72
00:05:14,260 --> 00:05:16,960
as long as they didn't go above 21 first.

73
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:21,120
If a player's total is higher than the dealer's, then the player's bet is doubled.

74
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:25,480
However, if a player's total is lower, they lose their bet.

75
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:29,640
Of course, this explanation skipped over plenty of smaller rules and less likely edge

76
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:34,600
cases, but it is these fundamental elements of gameplay that tie into why card counting

77
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:35,600
works.

78
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:41,120
Now, without getting too much into the math, on average, in Blackjack, higher value cards

79
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:45,100
benefit the player, while lower value cards benefit the dealer.

80
00:05:45,100 --> 00:05:48,980
While the explanation for the higher cards is more complex, lower cards' benefit is

81
00:05:48,980 --> 00:05:52,720
based on the fact that the dealer is required to take additional cards when their total

82
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:58,060
is less than 17, and so a greater density of lower cards makes it less likely that they'll

83
00:05:58,060 --> 00:06:01,880
go over 21, in which case each player's bet is doubled.

84
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:06,360
Therefore, if you know that a bunch of low cards are coming, you know that the odds are

85
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:10,440
against you and so you should reduce your bet or not play.

86
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:15,680
But, the question is, how do you know it's coming in a randomly shuffled deck?

87
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:21,640
Well, you perform process of elimination, or, even more simply, you count the cards

88
00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:22,680
you see.

89
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:26,160
There are hundreds of different forms of card counting that work in hundreds of different

90
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:31,400
ways, but all are more or less based on what's known as the high-low system.

91
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:36,280
With this, each card is assigned a value—two through six are assigned one, seven through

92
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:41,720
nine are assigned zero, and ten, the face cards and the ace, are assigned negative one.

93
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:45,920
This is based on the fact that, every time a high-value card is dealt, there are fewer

94
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:49,700
of them left in the deck, which means the odds get worse for the player considering

95
00:06:49,700 --> 00:06:53,340
that high-value cards are better for them, and vice versa.

96
00:06:53,340 --> 00:06:59,680
So, card counting is quite simple—with every card a player sees, they add up its assigned

97
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:00,680
value.

98
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:05,060
So, if there are three players and they are dealt these cards, the running count would

99
00:07:05,060 --> 00:07:11,400
be one, plus zero, plus negative one, plus one, plus zero, plus one, plus zero, which

100
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:13,500
would equal a total of two.

101
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:17,820
That total of two indicates that the odds have shifted slightly in the player's favor,

102
00:07:17,820 --> 00:07:22,320
while if it were negative two that would indicate the odds were in the dealer's favor.

103
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:26,480
As play goes on and they get deeper into the deck, the running count will generally increase

104
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:30,860
in one direction or the other, giving the player more confidence on where the odds stand

105
00:07:30,860 --> 00:07:35,140
and so if, for example, the running count equaled 20, the player would know that the

106
00:07:35,140 --> 00:07:40,100
odds were greatly in their favor and therefore that they should bet big on the next round,

107
00:07:40,100 --> 00:07:43,820
as they have a greater than 50% chance of winning.

108
00:07:43,820 --> 00:07:47,960
This is how people can reliably make money in blackjack.

109
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:51,460
If a player changed their bet by a factor of 15 depending on the odds, and the dealer

110
00:07:51,460 --> 00:07:55,560
waited until they were through five of the six decks before shuffling, a player, following

111
00:07:55,560 --> 00:08:03,420
perfect blackjack strategy, could earn an advantage of about 1.182% over at the house.

112
00:08:03,420 --> 00:08:07,560
That means that if, assuming a table completes a round of play every minute and the average

113
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:15,440
bet is around $200, a card counter could profit, on average, about $110 an hour—enough

114
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:22,120
that some people can and do make a living by sitting at blackjack tables counting cards.

115
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:27,100
However, considering how simple and reliable this advantage play method is, casinos go

116
00:08:27,100 --> 00:08:31,080
to great lengths to stop it, which is very, very difficult.

117
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:37,040
That's because the advantage is all in the mind—there's no good way to fully prove

118
00:08:37,040 --> 00:08:38,480
someone's card counting.

119
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:43,260
Sometimes, people are just lucky, and it's quite a bad look for casinos to kick people

120
00:08:43,260 --> 00:08:45,160
out just because they're winning.

121
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:50,160
That's why, instead of trying to prove it, most casinos implement rules to try and stop

122
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:52,640
card counting from working as well.

123
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:57,020
Remember that, generally, the running count will get further into the positive or negative

124
00:08:57,020 --> 00:09:01,120
the further into the game one goes, because the card counter will have seen more cards

125
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:04,360
that are now in the discard pile and therefore cannot be dealt.

126
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:08,920
While a few rounds in the running count might be in the single digits positive or negative,

127
00:09:08,920 --> 00:09:13,440
further on, it'll get into the double digits which gives a counter great confidence on

128
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:15,680
whether they should bet big or not.

129
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:20,400
It's towards the end of the shoe—the collection of undeal cards—when card counters really

130
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:25,280
make their money, so to make it less profitable, casinos can just have their dealers shuffle

131
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:26,660
earlier on.

132
00:09:26,660 --> 00:09:31,100
If they shuffle four decks deep into the six deck shoe rather than five, that decreases

133
00:09:31,100 --> 00:09:36,180
the player's advantage from 1.182% to just 0.568%.

134
00:09:36,180 --> 00:09:42,120
However, shuffling earlier and more often also cuts into the casino's profits because,

135
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:46,900
any time the dealer is shuffling, the non-advantaged players aren't playing and losing money,

136
00:09:46,900 --> 00:09:49,580
which is how the casino makes its money.

137
00:09:49,580 --> 00:09:52,940
Another option for casinos is to increase the number of decks they shuffle together

138
00:09:52,940 --> 00:09:54,800
to make the shoe.

139
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:59,540
Back before card counting first became a widespread issue for casinos, they would play blackjack

140
00:09:59,540 --> 00:10:03,860
with just a single deck of cards, but if they did this today, it would only be a matter

141
00:10:03,860 --> 00:10:07,660
of minutes before a card counter would have high confidence about the odds.

142
00:10:07,660 --> 00:10:12,420
Therefore, they typically now play with six decks shuffled together, which increases the

143
00:10:12,420 --> 00:10:17,900
time it takes to get to high confidence, and, since time is money for a card counter, this

144
00:10:17,900 --> 00:10:19,820
decreases their profits.

145
00:10:19,820 --> 00:10:24,620
Some casinos take this a step further by using continuous shuffle machines.

146
00:10:24,620 --> 00:10:29,380
With no discard pile, there is no increase or decrease in beneficial cards in the shoe,

147
00:10:29,380 --> 00:10:33,540
so card counting is completely ineffective, however, these machines are not yet fully

148
00:10:33,540 --> 00:10:37,260
widespread due to distrust by frequent players.

149
00:10:37,260 --> 00:10:40,760
While these methods deal with stopping or reducing a player's ability to actually

150
00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:45,140
know what the odds are at a given moment, the other method involves stopping a player's

151
00:10:45,140 --> 00:10:49,100
ability to respond to this knowledge by changing the size of their bets.

152
00:10:49,100 --> 00:10:54,220
Essentially, if a dealer or a pit boss suspects someone might be card counting, they'll

153
00:10:54,220 --> 00:10:57,300
change the rules on them and require flat betting.

154
00:10:57,300 --> 00:11:01,180
This is where a player is told to pick one bet size, and then they are not allowed to

155
00:11:01,180 --> 00:11:03,940
change that size from round to round.

156
00:11:03,940 --> 00:11:08,200
Therefore, card counters might know that the odds are changing, but they will not be able

157
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:13,180
to respond to it with a larger or smaller bet, so the odds will stay in the house's

158
00:11:13,180 --> 00:11:14,180
favour.

159
00:11:14,180 --> 00:11:18,940
However, that poses the question, how do you spot a card counter?

160
00:11:18,940 --> 00:11:22,900
Well, one of the most telltale signs is that they're winning.

161
00:11:22,900 --> 00:11:26,980
Even if someone is card counting, the casino does not care as long as they're losing,

162
00:11:26,980 --> 00:11:31,220
so they don't really pay attention to people until they've made some real money.

163
00:11:31,220 --> 00:11:35,200
Once they are, though, if a pit boss notices that a player, for example, changes their

164
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:40,140
bet from $100 to $1,000 right before a series of wins or as the shoe is close to finished,

165
00:11:40,140 --> 00:11:43,900
that's a good sign that they know what the odds are.

166
00:11:43,900 --> 00:11:48,940
In addition, professional card counters often start with a very large buy-in—they convert

167
00:11:48,940 --> 00:11:53,000
a lot of money into chips—because there is natural variance on whether or not they

168
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,260
win, even if they know the odds.

169
00:11:55,720 --> 00:12:00,180
They can win infinite money, but they can only lose as much money as they have, and

170
00:12:00,180 --> 00:12:04,540
even if they have an advantage, if they're unlucky and they lose all their money, there's

171
00:12:04,540 --> 00:12:06,260
no way to win it back.

172
00:12:06,260 --> 00:12:10,940
The math works out so that, if you want to win $170 an hour card counting, you need to

173
00:12:10,940 --> 00:12:17,260
have $100,000 in order to only have a 1% chance of running out of money.

174
00:12:17,260 --> 00:12:22,140
In the end, casinos don't need to make it impossible to count cards.

175
00:12:22,140 --> 00:12:26,420
Only a small minority of people will attempt it, and those that do can only make so much

176
00:12:26,420 --> 00:12:31,140
money per hour, so in a way, it's a cost of doing business.

177
00:12:31,140 --> 00:12:35,420
To avoid it making a big dent in their profits, all they need to do is make advantage play

178
00:12:35,420 --> 00:12:40,460
at their tables just a little bit harder than those next door, and if this is the case,

179
00:12:40,460 --> 00:12:42,780
the card counter will go next door.

180
00:12:42,780 --> 00:12:48,820
There will always be an escalating arms race by both players and casinos to gain an advantage

181
00:12:48,820 --> 00:12:51,660
and stop an advantage, respectively.

182
00:12:52,180 --> 00:12:56,800
Mathematics, economics, and human nature combined mean that as long as Blackjack and other flawed

183
00:12:56,800 --> 00:13:02,540
casino games stay popular, players will always find a way to tilt odds ever so slightly in

184
00:13:02,540 --> 00:13:05,140
their favor.

185
00:13:05,140 --> 00:13:10,100
Before I made this video, I took Brilliant's course on casino probability and, specifically,

186
00:13:10,100 --> 00:13:13,900
the section on Blackjack to be sure that I understood most of the math behind what I

187
00:13:13,900 --> 00:13:14,900
was talking about.

188
00:13:14,900 --> 00:13:19,500
In fact, part of the reason why I wanted to make this video was because I found the mathematics

189
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:24,360
of gambling so interesting, and so, if you did too, this course is a fantastic way to

190
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:26,340
dive deeper into the topic.

191
00:13:26,340 --> 00:13:30,460
You can even do this one on the go, in small chunks, with their mobile app, or learn something

192
00:13:30,460 --> 00:13:34,660
new every day with their daily challenges, or dive deep into something completely different

193
00:13:34,660 --> 00:13:38,540
with any one of their many dozens of super high quality classes.

194
00:13:38,540 --> 00:13:42,100
By high quality, I don't mean that they look good or work smoothly, even though they

195
00:13:42,100 --> 00:13:47,000
definitely do, but rather that their academics are designed in a way that makes rather complicated

196
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,860
subjects easy to learn.

197
00:13:48,860 --> 00:13:53,260
They teach you like the best teacher you've ever had—by breaking up big concepts into

198
00:13:53,260 --> 00:13:55,740
smaller, digestible, intuitive chunks.

199
00:13:55,740 --> 00:14:00,120
So, if you want to dive deep on useful STEM topics, including learning more about the

200
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:05,780
mathematics of gambling, be sure to be one of the first 200 to head over to brilliant.org-slash-windover
