10880	14140	There's a battle going on in the Pacific.
14140	18720	The People's Republic of China and the Republic of China, more commonly known as Taiwan, have
18720	24440	fought their territorial dispute for generations, but now, nearly each and every one of the
24440	30040	tiny nations dotting the Pacific Ocean has emerged as a battlefield for this conflict.
30040	35780	The weapons of this war are not guns and bullets, but rather concrete and banknotes.
35780	40580	This is a diplomatic mission aiming to shore up the support of some of the world's smallest
40580	42240	countries.
42240	47400	There are 14 nations in question here—Palau, Papua New Guinea, the Federated States of
47400	53640	Micronesia, the Solomon Islands, Nauru, Vanuatu, the Marshall Islands, Fiji, Tuvalu, Tonga,
53640	57000	Istribas, Samoa, Nui, and the Cook Islands.
57000	61720	With the exception of Papua New Guinea, each of these have populations below one million
61720	66760	and each also tends to have fairly low GDP per capita—generally between one and five
66760	68440	thousand dollars.
68440	73080	This means that they're each granted fairly significant amounts of foreign aid.
73080	80740	In the previous decade, Nui, for example, received $134 million in aid, or about $83,000
80740	83440	for each member of its population.
83440	88440	nationwide that average is only in the low-thousands, but the point is that the Pacific gets a lot
88440	89440	of aid.
89440	95680	Now, most of this does not come from Taiwan or China—Australia is by far the largest
95680	96680	donor.
96680	100920	It is important for Australia to be in these countries' good graces for strategic reasons.
100920	105800	For example, 6% of Australia's GDP is made up solely of exports that take one of these
105800	111140	three maritime routes, each of which passes by some of these Pacific countries.
111140	115440	These trade routes could be disrupted if there were instability in the Pacific.
115440	119460	Political stability also keeps foreign powers from attempting a power grab in any one of
119460	124460	these nations, and any such power grab would likely be too close for comfort for Australia.
124460	129260	So, the primary aid motivation for Australia and its close allies, like New Zealand and
129260	131940	the US, is stability.
131940	136760	That is not the primary motivation for China and Taiwan.
136760	140880	These two powers are openly engaging in what's known as checkbook diplomacy.
140880	145500	They're buying diplomatic partners through financial aid, but why?
145500	150720	China is a massive nation of more than a billion people—what benefit does it receive from
150720	155160	having tiny nations like Samoa, Tonga, or Fiji on its side?
155160	160620	Well, they might gain some limited benefit, but the main reason China works to build these
160620	163680	diplomatic partnerships is so Taiwan cannot.
163680	170000	That's because, to Taiwan, even a tiny, 11,000 person nation like Tuvalu is hugely
170000	176740	valuable as Tuvalu has something Taiwan doesn't—Tuvalu is a member of the United Nations.
176740	181660	Taiwan is rarely recognized as an independent country in international settings.
181660	186780	This is despite the fact that, in almost every way, it acts and operates as an independent
186780	187780	country would.
187780	192120	There are plenty of countries, like the US for example, that have strong relations with
192120	194720	Taiwan and treat it as if it were a country.
194720	200280	The US has a de facto embassy in Taiwan, recognizes Taiwanese passports, sells military supplies
200280	204840	to Taiwan, and has an enormously strong trade relationship with Taiwan, yet it does not
204840	206860	recognize Taiwan as a country.
206860	213260	That's because, in international relations, there is an implicit rule—you either recognize
213260	217300	the Republic of China or the People's Republic of China.
217300	221780	Now, given the choice between working with the world's most populous country or a moderately
221780	226500	sized island of 24 million, nearly every nation picks China.
226500	231180	Even though Taiwan and the US are functionally allies while China and the US are frenemies,
231180	236380	at best, it's just not worthwhile for the US to recognize Taiwan as a country.
236380	243260	This is the case for almost every country—that is, of course, unless Taiwan makes it worthwhile.
243260	248620	Across the Pacific, Taiwan has been funding projects to keep small nations on its side.
248620	253540	In Palau, they spent $1.3 million to help the country recover from Typhoon Haiyan.
253540	258140	In Papua New Guinea, they spent $4.5 million to improve domestic agriculture in order to
258140	259260	increase food security.
259260	264120	In the Solomon Islands, they spent $2.5 million to train local staff and conduct a survey
264120	266660	of the island's local plant species.
266660	271140	In Nauru, they spent $600,000 donating more efficient compact fluorescent light bulbs
271140	272740	to local households.
272740	277100	In the Marshall Islands, they spent $1 million building a sea wall around Majuro Atoll to
277100	279180	protect it from rising sea levels.
279180	284380	In Fiji, they spent $300,000 improving mental health service access around the country.
284380	288920	In Tuvalu, they spent $200,000 repairing and improving water storage equipment around the
288920	290860	country after a cyclone.
290860	296060	In Kiribati, they spent $19 million to repair and upgrade the country's main airport.
296060	300660	Each of these projects, and the hundreds more funded by Taiwan around the Pacific, improves
300660	306260	its relations with these countries and therefore brings it more and more diplomatic clout.
306260	311540	Taiwan can't afford to buy the support of large nations, but in some settings, the size
311540	314020	of the nation doesn't matter.
314020	318740	In the United Nations General Assembly, for example, it's one country, one vote.
318740	324820	It doesn't matter if it's Tuvalu or China—when voting, every member nation has the exact
324820	326300	same power.
326300	330860	There are other systems in the UN where power is more balanced based on population, but
330860	336720	overall, the world's smallest nations have a disproportionate amount of power.
336720	341560	More recognition, even by the smallest countries, strengthens Taiwan's case for a position
341560	344300	in intergovernmental organizations like the UN.
344300	347780	That's why Taiwan targets small nations for support.
347780	354060	$5 million spent on Tuvalu goes a lot further than $5 million spent on Mexico, for example,
354060	359300	but in the General Assembly, Tuvalu can help Taiwan just as much as Mexico can.
359300	364580	This diplomatic clout that Taiwan has amassed, though, gets in the way of China's ambition
364580	366660	of eventually unifying the two.
366660	372180	It is for that reason that the People's Republic has gone on the offensive.
372180	376900	China has been courting Taiwan's diplomatic partners in the Pacific with promises of larger
376900	378660	aid packages.
378660	382820	The most recent two defectors were Kiribati and the Solomon Islands.
382820	388740	Early in the 2010s, China provided no foreign aid to either of these countries, but then,
388740	394540	as soon as they each revoked their recognition of Taiwan, promises of planes, ferries, medical
394540	397900	supplies, and more started pouring in from China.
397900	402020	In addition to these two countries, Taiwan has lost diplomatic support from the Dominican
402020	408340	Republic, Burkina Faso, El Salvador, Panama, and São Tomé and Príncipe since 2016.
408340	414940	That leaves them with just 15 total diplomatic partners and only four in the Pacific region.
414940	420580	To maintain the limited support that it has, Taiwan has had to get tactical.
420580	426780	China's style with aid is to build big, flashy, expensive infrastructure projects.
426780	431980	In Fiji, they spent $50 million building a paved road that halved the time it took for
431980	437020	local farmers to get to markets, but local engineers reportedly said that a far lower
437020	440640	quality and cheaper road could have achieved the same result.
440640	445640	In Vanuatu, they spent $80 million upgrading a port to allow for larger cruise ships to
445640	450660	dock, but in all of 2019, for example, just five visited.
450660	454880	In Papua New Guinea, they spent $1 million building a malaria hospital in the capital
454880	459520	of Port Moresby, despite that being the region of the country with the least malaria, and
459520	464080	despite the capital having no road link to the regions with the worst malaria outbreaks.
464080	469360	Each of these projects and more clearly have positive effects, but undoubtedly they are
469360	475200	not the most efficient uses of $1, or $50, or $80 million in the mission of improving
475200	478840	relations between China and these Pacific nations.
478840	483360	China does big, flashy, and sometimes ineffective aid.
483360	488400	Taiwan does small, personable, and generally more effective aid.
488400	493520	That's why they have been able to maintain the relationships they have for so long, despite
493520	495880	a much lower budget.
495880	498160	China works to impress the governments.
498160	500720	Taiwan works to impress the people.
500720	506160	Taiwan's average aid project size in the Pacific is $500,000.
506160	508560	China's is $6 million.
508560	512920	Taiwan does things like contribute $1,600 for Palau's baseball team to attend a tournament
512920	517880	in Guam, or spend $200,000 buying a boat for an outer atoll in the Marshall Islands, or
517880	521400	construct $300,000 of solar street lights in Nauru.
521400	526680	The $80 million port in Vanuatu might help people more than the $1,600 for the baseball
526680	531720	team in Palau, but one can be sure that every member of that team and their families and
531720	535960	friends heard about and remember how Taiwan helped them.
535960	540600	That's less likely with the large, somewhat ineffective port.
540600	545680	Taiwan knows that the choice of which side to support is a political issue in the Pacific
545680	548020	because there is that choice.
548020	552480	Pretty much any politician in these countries will run their campaign with the Taiwan issue
552480	558080	as part of their platform and so Taiwan is trying to gain the support of everyday people.
558080	562840	They want to win support from the ground up, rather than from the top down.
562840	567560	This might create a better value for their money, but at the end of the day, China just
567560	570320	has so much more money.
570320	575120	If China wants to win the political support of a small nation, they can just spend and
575120	577360	spend and spend.
577360	583040	At this point, Taiwan's few, tiny diplomatic partners are no longer a threat to China's
583040	585320	goal of reunification.
585320	590120	China will likely keep courting these nations, not because they need to, but because it'll
590120	591720	further weaken Taiwan.
591720	597040	Eventually, though, if there comes a day when the Taiwan issue is resolved, either through
597040	602860	reunification or recognized independence, the Pacific Islands will be victims because,
602860	611820	when they're no longer useful, the pawn is the first to be sacrificed.
611820	615340	If you want to learn more about one of the four Pacific Island nations that are still
615340	620280	on Taiwan's side, the Marshall Islands, you can watch the Nebula-exclusive documentary
620280	623580	we filmed on location in the Marshall Islands.
623580	628460	You heard earlier that Taiwan funded a seawall for the capital, Majuro, but the final years
628460	632860	of Majuro explains why that was necessary, and what it means for the nation.
632860	637940	It explains what life is like in a nation with an expiration date.
