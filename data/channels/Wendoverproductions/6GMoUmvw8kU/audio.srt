4
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:14,140
There's a battle going on in the Pacific.

5
00:00:14,140 --> 00:00:18,720
The People's Republic of China and the Republic of China, more commonly known as Taiwan, have

6
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:24,440
fought their territorial dispute for generations, but now, nearly each and every one of the

7
00:00:24,440 --> 00:00:30,040
tiny nations dotting the Pacific Ocean has emerged as a battlefield for this conflict.

8
00:00:30,040 --> 00:00:35,780
The weapons of this war are not guns and bullets, but rather concrete and banknotes.

9
00:00:35,780 --> 00:00:40,580
This is a diplomatic mission aiming to shore up the support of some of the world's smallest

10
00:00:40,580 --> 00:00:42,240
countries.

11
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:47,400
There are 14 nations in question here—Palau, Papua New Guinea, the Federated States of

12
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:53,640
Micronesia, the Solomon Islands, Nauru, Vanuatu, the Marshall Islands, Fiji, Tuvalu, Tonga,

13
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:57,000
Istribas, Samoa, Nui, and the Cook Islands.

14
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:01,720
With the exception of Papua New Guinea, each of these have populations below one million

15
00:01:01,720 --> 00:01:06,760
and each also tends to have fairly low GDP per capita—generally between one and five

16
00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:08,440
thousand dollars.

17
00:01:08,440 --> 00:01:13,080
This means that they're each granted fairly significant amounts of foreign aid.

18
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:20,740
In the previous decade, Nui, for example, received $134 million in aid, or about $83,000

19
00:01:20,740 --> 00:01:23,440
for each member of its population.

20
00:01:23,440 --> 00:01:28,440
nationwide that average is only in the low-thousands, but the point is that the Pacific gets a lot

21
00:01:28,440 --> 00:01:29,440
of aid.

22
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:35,680
Now, most of this does not come from Taiwan or China—Australia is by far the largest

23
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:36,680
donor.

24
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:40,920
It is important for Australia to be in these countries' good graces for strategic reasons.

25
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:45,800
For example, 6% of Australia's GDP is made up solely of exports that take one of these

26
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:51,140
three maritime routes, each of which passes by some of these Pacific countries.

27
00:01:51,140 --> 00:01:55,440
These trade routes could be disrupted if there were instability in the Pacific.

28
00:01:55,440 --> 00:01:59,460
Political stability also keeps foreign powers from attempting a power grab in any one of

29
00:01:59,460 --> 00:02:04,460
these nations, and any such power grab would likely be too close for comfort for Australia.

30
00:02:04,460 --> 00:02:09,260
So, the primary aid motivation for Australia and its close allies, like New Zealand and

31
00:02:09,260 --> 00:02:11,940
the US, is stability.

32
00:02:11,940 --> 00:02:16,760
That is not the primary motivation for China and Taiwan.

33
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:20,880
These two powers are openly engaging in what's known as checkbook diplomacy.

34
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:25,500
They're buying diplomatic partners through financial aid, but why?

35
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:30,720
China is a massive nation of more than a billion people—what benefit does it receive from

36
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:35,160
having tiny nations like Samoa, Tonga, or Fiji on its side?

37
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:40,620
Well, they might gain some limited benefit, but the main reason China works to build these

38
00:02:40,620 --> 00:02:43,680
diplomatic partnerships is so Taiwan cannot.

39
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:50,000
That's because, to Taiwan, even a tiny, 11,000 person nation like Tuvalu is hugely

40
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:56,740
valuable as Tuvalu has something Taiwan doesn't—Tuvalu is a member of the United Nations.

41
00:02:56,740 --> 00:03:01,660
Taiwan is rarely recognized as an independent country in international settings.

42
00:03:01,660 --> 00:03:06,780
This is despite the fact that, in almost every way, it acts and operates as an independent

43
00:03:06,780 --> 00:03:07,780
country would.

44
00:03:07,780 --> 00:03:12,120
There are plenty of countries, like the US for example, that have strong relations with

45
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:14,720
Taiwan and treat it as if it were a country.

46
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:20,280
The US has a de facto embassy in Taiwan, recognizes Taiwanese passports, sells military supplies

47
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:24,840
to Taiwan, and has an enormously strong trade relationship with Taiwan, yet it does not

48
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:26,860
recognize Taiwan as a country.

49
00:03:26,860 --> 00:03:33,260
That's because, in international relations, there is an implicit rule—you either recognize

50
00:03:33,260 --> 00:03:37,300
the Republic of China or the People's Republic of China.

51
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:41,780
Now, given the choice between working with the world's most populous country or a moderately

52
00:03:41,780 --> 00:03:46,500
sized island of 24 million, nearly every nation picks China.

53
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:51,180
Even though Taiwan and the US are functionally allies while China and the US are frenemies,

54
00:03:51,180 --> 00:03:56,380
at best, it's just not worthwhile for the US to recognize Taiwan as a country.

55
00:03:56,380 --> 00:04:03,260
This is the case for almost every country—that is, of course, unless Taiwan makes it worthwhile.

56
00:04:03,260 --> 00:04:08,620
Across the Pacific, Taiwan has been funding projects to keep small nations on its side.

57
00:04:08,620 --> 00:04:13,540
In Palau, they spent $1.3 million to help the country recover from Typhoon Haiyan.

58
00:04:13,540 --> 00:04:18,140
In Papua New Guinea, they spent $4.5 million to improve domestic agriculture in order to

59
00:04:18,140 --> 00:04:19,260
increase food security.

60
00:04:19,260 --> 00:04:24,120
In the Solomon Islands, they spent $2.5 million to train local staff and conduct a survey

61
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:26,660
of the island's local plant species.

62
00:04:26,660 --> 00:04:31,140
In Nauru, they spent $600,000 donating more efficient compact fluorescent light bulbs

63
00:04:31,140 --> 00:04:32,740
to local households.

64
00:04:32,740 --> 00:04:37,100
In the Marshall Islands, they spent $1 million building a sea wall around Majuro Atoll to

65
00:04:37,100 --> 00:04:39,180
protect it from rising sea levels.

66
00:04:39,180 --> 00:04:44,380
In Fiji, they spent $300,000 improving mental health service access around the country.

67
00:04:44,380 --> 00:04:48,920
In Tuvalu, they spent $200,000 repairing and improving water storage equipment around the

68
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:50,860
country after a cyclone.

69
00:04:50,860 --> 00:04:56,060
In Kiribati, they spent $19 million to repair and upgrade the country's main airport.

70
00:04:56,060 --> 00:05:00,660
Each of these projects, and the hundreds more funded by Taiwan around the Pacific, improves

71
00:05:00,660 --> 00:05:06,260
its relations with these countries and therefore brings it more and more diplomatic clout.

72
00:05:06,260 --> 00:05:11,540
Taiwan can't afford to buy the support of large nations, but in some settings, the size

73
00:05:11,540 --> 00:05:14,020
of the nation doesn't matter.

74
00:05:14,020 --> 00:05:18,740
In the United Nations General Assembly, for example, it's one country, one vote.

75
00:05:18,740 --> 00:05:24,820
It doesn't matter if it's Tuvalu or China—when voting, every member nation has the exact

76
00:05:24,820 --> 00:05:26,300
same power.

77
00:05:26,300 --> 00:05:30,860
There are other systems in the UN where power is more balanced based on population, but

78
00:05:30,860 --> 00:05:36,720
overall, the world's smallest nations have a disproportionate amount of power.

79
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:41,560
More recognition, even by the smallest countries, strengthens Taiwan's case for a position

80
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:44,300
in intergovernmental organizations like the UN.

81
00:05:44,300 --> 00:05:47,780
That's why Taiwan targets small nations for support.

82
00:05:47,780 --> 00:05:54,060
$5 million spent on Tuvalu goes a lot further than $5 million spent on Mexico, for example,

83
00:05:54,060 --> 00:05:59,300
but in the General Assembly, Tuvalu can help Taiwan just as much as Mexico can.

84
00:05:59,300 --> 00:06:04,580
This diplomatic clout that Taiwan has amassed, though, gets in the way of China's ambition

85
00:06:04,580 --> 00:06:06,660
of eventually unifying the two.

86
00:06:06,660 --> 00:06:12,180
It is for that reason that the People's Republic has gone on the offensive.

87
00:06:12,180 --> 00:06:16,900
China has been courting Taiwan's diplomatic partners in the Pacific with promises of larger

88
00:06:16,900 --> 00:06:18,660
aid packages.

89
00:06:18,660 --> 00:06:22,820
The most recent two defectors were Kiribati and the Solomon Islands.

90
00:06:22,820 --> 00:06:28,740
Early in the 2010s, China provided no foreign aid to either of these countries, but then,

91
00:06:28,740 --> 00:06:34,540
as soon as they each revoked their recognition of Taiwan, promises of planes, ferries, medical

92
00:06:34,540 --> 00:06:37,900
supplies, and more started pouring in from China.

93
00:06:37,900 --> 00:06:42,020
In addition to these two countries, Taiwan has lost diplomatic support from the Dominican

94
00:06:42,020 --> 00:06:48,340
Republic, Burkina Faso, El Salvador, Panama, and São Tomé and Príncipe since 2016.

95
00:06:48,340 --> 00:06:54,940
That leaves them with just 15 total diplomatic partners and only four in the Pacific region.

96
00:06:54,940 --> 00:07:00,580
To maintain the limited support that it has, Taiwan has had to get tactical.

97
00:07:00,580 --> 00:07:06,780
China's style with aid is to build big, flashy, expensive infrastructure projects.

98
00:07:06,780 --> 00:07:11,980
In Fiji, they spent $50 million building a paved road that halved the time it took for

99
00:07:11,980 --> 00:07:17,020
local farmers to get to markets, but local engineers reportedly said that a far lower

100
00:07:17,020 --> 00:07:20,640
quality and cheaper road could have achieved the same result.

101
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:25,640
In Vanuatu, they spent $80 million upgrading a port to allow for larger cruise ships to

102
00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:30,660
dock, but in all of 2019, for example, just five visited.

103
00:07:30,660 --> 00:07:34,880
In Papua New Guinea, they spent $1 million building a malaria hospital in the capital

104
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:39,520
of Port Moresby, despite that being the region of the country with the least malaria, and

105
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:44,080
despite the capital having no road link to the regions with the worst malaria outbreaks.

106
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:49,360
Each of these projects and more clearly have positive effects, but undoubtedly they are

107
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:55,200
not the most efficient uses of $1, or $50, or $80 million in the mission of improving

108
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:58,840
relations between China and these Pacific nations.

109
00:07:58,840 --> 00:08:03,360
China does big, flashy, and sometimes ineffective aid.

110
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:08,400
Taiwan does small, personable, and generally more effective aid.

111
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:13,520
That's why they have been able to maintain the relationships they have for so long, despite

112
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:15,880
a much lower budget.

113
00:08:15,880 --> 00:08:18,160
China works to impress the governments.

114
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:20,720
Taiwan works to impress the people.

115
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:26,160
Taiwan's average aid project size in the Pacific is $500,000.

116
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:28,560
China's is $6 million.

117
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:32,920
Taiwan does things like contribute $1,600 for Palau's baseball team to attend a tournament

118
00:08:32,920 --> 00:08:37,880
in Guam, or spend $200,000 buying a boat for an outer atoll in the Marshall Islands, or

119
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:41,400
construct $300,000 of solar street lights in Nauru.

120
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:46,680
The $80 million port in Vanuatu might help people more than the $1,600 for the baseball

121
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:51,720
team in Palau, but one can be sure that every member of that team and their families and

122
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:55,960
friends heard about and remember how Taiwan helped them.

123
00:08:55,960 --> 00:09:00,600
That's less likely with the large, somewhat ineffective port.

124
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:05,680
Taiwan knows that the choice of which side to support is a political issue in the Pacific

125
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:08,020
because there is that choice.

126
00:09:08,020 --> 00:09:12,480
Pretty much any politician in these countries will run their campaign with the Taiwan issue

127
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:18,080
as part of their platform and so Taiwan is trying to gain the support of everyday people.

128
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:22,840
They want to win support from the ground up, rather than from the top down.

129
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:27,560
This might create a better value for their money, but at the end of the day, China just

130
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:30,320
has so much more money.

131
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:35,120
If China wants to win the political support of a small nation, they can just spend and

132
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:37,360
spend and spend.

133
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:43,040
At this point, Taiwan's few, tiny diplomatic partners are no longer a threat to China's

134
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:45,320
goal of reunification.

135
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:50,120
China will likely keep courting these nations, not because they need to, but because it'll

136
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:51,720
further weaken Taiwan.

137
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:57,040
Eventually, though, if there comes a day when the Taiwan issue is resolved, either through

138
00:09:57,040 --> 00:10:02,860
reunification or recognized independence, the Pacific Islands will be victims because,

139
00:10:02,860 --> 00:10:11,820
when they're no longer useful, the pawn is the first to be sacrificed.

140
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:15,340
If you want to learn more about one of the four Pacific Island nations that are still

141
00:10:15,340 --> 00:10:20,280
on Taiwan's side, the Marshall Islands, you can watch the Nebula-exclusive documentary

142
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:23,580
we filmed on location in the Marshall Islands.

143
00:10:23,580 --> 00:10:28,460
You heard earlier that Taiwan funded a seawall for the capital, Majuro, but the final years

144
00:10:28,460 --> 00:10:32,860
of Majuro explains why that was necessary, and what it means for the nation.

145
00:10:32,860 --> 00:10:37,940
It explains what life is like in a nation with an expiration date.
