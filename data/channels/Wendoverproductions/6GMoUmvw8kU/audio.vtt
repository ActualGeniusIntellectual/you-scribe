00:10.880 --> 00:14.140
There's a battle going on in the Pacific.

00:14.140 --> 00:18.720
The People's Republic of China and the Republic of China, more commonly known as Taiwan, have

00:18.720 --> 00:24.440
fought their territorial dispute for generations, but now, nearly each and every one of the

00:24.440 --> 00:30.040
tiny nations dotting the Pacific Ocean has emerged as a battlefield for this conflict.

00:30.040 --> 00:35.780
The weapons of this war are not guns and bullets, but rather concrete and banknotes.

00:35.780 --> 00:40.580
This is a diplomatic mission aiming to shore up the support of some of the world's smallest

00:40.580 --> 00:42.240
countries.

00:42.240 --> 00:47.400
There are 14 nations in question here—Palau, Papua New Guinea, the Federated States of

00:47.400 --> 00:53.640
Micronesia, the Solomon Islands, Nauru, Vanuatu, the Marshall Islands, Fiji, Tuvalu, Tonga,

00:53.640 --> 00:57.000
Istribas, Samoa, Nui, and the Cook Islands.

00:57.000 --> 01:01.720
With the exception of Papua New Guinea, each of these have populations below one million

01:01.720 --> 01:06.760
and each also tends to have fairly low GDP per capita—generally between one and five

01:06.760 --> 01:08.440
thousand dollars.

01:08.440 --> 01:13.080
This means that they're each granted fairly significant amounts of foreign aid.

01:13.080 --> 01:20.740
In the previous decade, Nui, for example, received $134 million in aid, or about $83,000

01:20.740 --> 01:23.440
for each member of its population.

01:23.440 --> 01:28.440
nationwide that average is only in the low-thousands, but the point is that the Pacific gets a lot

01:28.440 --> 01:29.440
of aid.

01:29.440 --> 01:35.680
Now, most of this does not come from Taiwan or China—Australia is by far the largest

01:35.680 --> 01:36.680
donor.

01:36.680 --> 01:40.920
It is important for Australia to be in these countries' good graces for strategic reasons.

01:40.920 --> 01:45.800
For example, 6% of Australia's GDP is made up solely of exports that take one of these

01:45.800 --> 01:51.140
three maritime routes, each of which passes by some of these Pacific countries.

01:51.140 --> 01:55.440
These trade routes could be disrupted if there were instability in the Pacific.

01:55.440 --> 01:59.460
Political stability also keeps foreign powers from attempting a power grab in any one of

01:59.460 --> 02:04.460
these nations, and any such power grab would likely be too close for comfort for Australia.

02:04.460 --> 02:09.260
So, the primary aid motivation for Australia and its close allies, like New Zealand and

02:09.260 --> 02:11.940
the US, is stability.

02:11.940 --> 02:16.760
That is not the primary motivation for China and Taiwan.

02:16.760 --> 02:20.880
These two powers are openly engaging in what's known as checkbook diplomacy.

02:20.880 --> 02:25.500
They're buying diplomatic partners through financial aid, but why?

02:25.500 --> 02:30.720
China is a massive nation of more than a billion people—what benefit does it receive from

02:30.720 --> 02:35.160
having tiny nations like Samoa, Tonga, or Fiji on its side?

02:35.160 --> 02:40.620
Well, they might gain some limited benefit, but the main reason China works to build these

02:40.620 --> 02:43.680
diplomatic partnerships is so Taiwan cannot.

02:43.680 --> 02:50.000
That's because, to Taiwan, even a tiny, 11,000 person nation like Tuvalu is hugely

02:50.000 --> 02:56.740
valuable as Tuvalu has something Taiwan doesn't—Tuvalu is a member of the United Nations.

02:56.740 --> 03:01.660
Taiwan is rarely recognized as an independent country in international settings.

03:01.660 --> 03:06.780
This is despite the fact that, in almost every way, it acts and operates as an independent

03:06.780 --> 03:07.780
country would.

03:07.780 --> 03:12.120
There are plenty of countries, like the US for example, that have strong relations with

03:12.120 --> 03:14.720
Taiwan and treat it as if it were a country.

03:14.720 --> 03:20.280
The US has a de facto embassy in Taiwan, recognizes Taiwanese passports, sells military supplies

03:20.280 --> 03:24.840
to Taiwan, and has an enormously strong trade relationship with Taiwan, yet it does not

03:24.840 --> 03:26.860
recognize Taiwan as a country.

03:26.860 --> 03:33.260
That's because, in international relations, there is an implicit rule—you either recognize

03:33.260 --> 03:37.300
the Republic of China or the People's Republic of China.

03:37.300 --> 03:41.780
Now, given the choice between working with the world's most populous country or a moderately

03:41.780 --> 03:46.500
sized island of 24 million, nearly every nation picks China.

03:46.500 --> 03:51.180
Even though Taiwan and the US are functionally allies while China and the US are frenemies,

03:51.180 --> 03:56.380
at best, it's just not worthwhile for the US to recognize Taiwan as a country.

03:56.380 --> 04:03.260
This is the case for almost every country—that is, of course, unless Taiwan makes it worthwhile.

04:03.260 --> 04:08.620
Across the Pacific, Taiwan has been funding projects to keep small nations on its side.

04:08.620 --> 04:13.540
In Palau, they spent $1.3 million to help the country recover from Typhoon Haiyan.

04:13.540 --> 04:18.140
In Papua New Guinea, they spent $4.5 million to improve domestic agriculture in order to

04:18.140 --> 04:19.260
increase food security.

04:19.260 --> 04:24.120
In the Solomon Islands, they spent $2.5 million to train local staff and conduct a survey

04:24.120 --> 04:26.660
of the island's local plant species.

04:26.660 --> 04:31.140
In Nauru, they spent $600,000 donating more efficient compact fluorescent light bulbs

04:31.140 --> 04:32.740
to local households.

04:32.740 --> 04:37.100
In the Marshall Islands, they spent $1 million building a sea wall around Majuro Atoll to

04:37.100 --> 04:39.180
protect it from rising sea levels.

04:39.180 --> 04:44.380
In Fiji, they spent $300,000 improving mental health service access around the country.

04:44.380 --> 04:48.920
In Tuvalu, they spent $200,000 repairing and improving water storage equipment around the

04:48.920 --> 04:50.860
country after a cyclone.

04:50.860 --> 04:56.060
In Kiribati, they spent $19 million to repair and upgrade the country's main airport.

04:56.060 --> 05:00.660
Each of these projects, and the hundreds more funded by Taiwan around the Pacific, improves

05:00.660 --> 05:06.260
its relations with these countries and therefore brings it more and more diplomatic clout.

05:06.260 --> 05:11.540
Taiwan can't afford to buy the support of large nations, but in some settings, the size

05:11.540 --> 05:14.020
of the nation doesn't matter.

05:14.020 --> 05:18.740
In the United Nations General Assembly, for example, it's one country, one vote.

05:18.740 --> 05:24.820
It doesn't matter if it's Tuvalu or China—when voting, every member nation has the exact

05:24.820 --> 05:26.300
same power.

05:26.300 --> 05:30.860
There are other systems in the UN where power is more balanced based on population, but

05:30.860 --> 05:36.720
overall, the world's smallest nations have a disproportionate amount of power.

05:36.720 --> 05:41.560
More recognition, even by the smallest countries, strengthens Taiwan's case for a position

05:41.560 --> 05:44.300
in intergovernmental organizations like the UN.

05:44.300 --> 05:47.780
That's why Taiwan targets small nations for support.

05:47.780 --> 05:54.060
$5 million spent on Tuvalu goes a lot further than $5 million spent on Mexico, for example,

05:54.060 --> 05:59.300
but in the General Assembly, Tuvalu can help Taiwan just as much as Mexico can.

05:59.300 --> 06:04.580
This diplomatic clout that Taiwan has amassed, though, gets in the way of China's ambition

06:04.580 --> 06:06.660
of eventually unifying the two.

06:06.660 --> 06:12.180
It is for that reason that the People's Republic has gone on the offensive.

06:12.180 --> 06:16.900
China has been courting Taiwan's diplomatic partners in the Pacific with promises of larger

06:16.900 --> 06:18.660
aid packages.

06:18.660 --> 06:22.820
The most recent two defectors were Kiribati and the Solomon Islands.

06:22.820 --> 06:28.740
Early in the 2010s, China provided no foreign aid to either of these countries, but then,

06:28.740 --> 06:34.540
as soon as they each revoked their recognition of Taiwan, promises of planes, ferries, medical

06:34.540 --> 06:37.900
supplies, and more started pouring in from China.

06:37.900 --> 06:42.020
In addition to these two countries, Taiwan has lost diplomatic support from the Dominican

06:42.020 --> 06:48.340
Republic, Burkina Faso, El Salvador, Panama, and São Tomé and Príncipe since 2016.

06:48.340 --> 06:54.940
That leaves them with just 15 total diplomatic partners and only four in the Pacific region.

06:54.940 --> 07:00.580
To maintain the limited support that it has, Taiwan has had to get tactical.

07:00.580 --> 07:06.780
China's style with aid is to build big, flashy, expensive infrastructure projects.

07:06.780 --> 07:11.980
In Fiji, they spent $50 million building a paved road that halved the time it took for

07:11.980 --> 07:17.020
local farmers to get to markets, but local engineers reportedly said that a far lower

07:17.020 --> 07:20.640
quality and cheaper road could have achieved the same result.

07:20.640 --> 07:25.640
In Vanuatu, they spent $80 million upgrading a port to allow for larger cruise ships to

07:25.640 --> 07:30.660
dock, but in all of 2019, for example, just five visited.

07:30.660 --> 07:34.880
In Papua New Guinea, they spent $1 million building a malaria hospital in the capital

07:34.880 --> 07:39.520
of Port Moresby, despite that being the region of the country with the least malaria, and

07:39.520 --> 07:44.080
despite the capital having no road link to the regions with the worst malaria outbreaks.

07:44.080 --> 07:49.360
Each of these projects and more clearly have positive effects, but undoubtedly they are

07:49.360 --> 07:55.200
not the most efficient uses of $1, or $50, or $80 million in the mission of improving

07:55.200 --> 07:58.840
relations between China and these Pacific nations.

07:58.840 --> 08:03.360
China does big, flashy, and sometimes ineffective aid.

08:03.360 --> 08:08.400
Taiwan does small, personable, and generally more effective aid.

08:08.400 --> 08:13.520
That's why they have been able to maintain the relationships they have for so long, despite

08:13.520 --> 08:15.880
a much lower budget.

08:15.880 --> 08:18.160
China works to impress the governments.

08:18.160 --> 08:20.720
Taiwan works to impress the people.

08:20.720 --> 08:26.160
Taiwan's average aid project size in the Pacific is $500,000.

08:26.160 --> 08:28.560
China's is $6 million.

08:28.560 --> 08:32.920
Taiwan does things like contribute $1,600 for Palau's baseball team to attend a tournament

08:32.920 --> 08:37.880
in Guam, or spend $200,000 buying a boat for an outer atoll in the Marshall Islands, or

08:37.880 --> 08:41.400
construct $300,000 of solar street lights in Nauru.

08:41.400 --> 08:46.680
The $80 million port in Vanuatu might help people more than the $1,600 for the baseball

08:46.680 --> 08:51.720
team in Palau, but one can be sure that every member of that team and their families and

08:51.720 --> 08:55.960
friends heard about and remember how Taiwan helped them.

08:55.960 --> 09:00.600
That's less likely with the large, somewhat ineffective port.

09:00.600 --> 09:05.680
Taiwan knows that the choice of which side to support is a political issue in the Pacific

09:05.680 --> 09:08.020
because there is that choice.

09:08.020 --> 09:12.480
Pretty much any politician in these countries will run their campaign with the Taiwan issue

09:12.480 --> 09:18.080
as part of their platform and so Taiwan is trying to gain the support of everyday people.

09:18.080 --> 09:22.840
They want to win support from the ground up, rather than from the top down.

09:22.840 --> 09:27.560
This might create a better value for their money, but at the end of the day, China just

09:27.560 --> 09:30.320
has so much more money.

09:30.320 --> 09:35.120
If China wants to win the political support of a small nation, they can just spend and

09:35.120 --> 09:37.360
spend and spend.

09:37.360 --> 09:43.040
At this point, Taiwan's few, tiny diplomatic partners are no longer a threat to China's

09:43.040 --> 09:45.320
goal of reunification.

09:45.320 --> 09:50.120
China will likely keep courting these nations, not because they need to, but because it'll

09:50.120 --> 09:51.720
further weaken Taiwan.

09:51.720 --> 09:57.040
Eventually, though, if there comes a day when the Taiwan issue is resolved, either through

09:57.040 --> 10:02.860
reunification or recognized independence, the Pacific Islands will be victims because,

10:02.860 --> 10:11.820
when they're no longer useful, the pawn is the first to be sacrificed.

10:11.820 --> 10:15.340
If you want to learn more about one of the four Pacific Island nations that are still

10:15.340 --> 10:20.280
on Taiwan's side, the Marshall Islands, you can watch the Nebula-exclusive documentary

10:20.280 --> 10:23.580
we filmed on location in the Marshall Islands.

10:23.580 --> 10:28.460
You heard earlier that Taiwan funded a seawall for the capital, Majuro, but the final years

10:28.460 --> 10:32.860
of Majuro explains why that was necessary, and what it means for the nation.

10:32.860 --> 10:37.940
It explains what life is like in a nation with an expiration date.

10:37.940 --> 10:43.100
