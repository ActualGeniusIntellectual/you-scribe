00:10.020 --> 00:14.820
Nuclear energy is one of the cleanest, most efficient, and most available sources of power

00:14.820 --> 00:15.820
on earth.

00:15.820 --> 00:21.180
To generate 1 kilowatt-hour of energy—the amount an American household consumes in 48

00:21.180 --> 00:26.660
minutes—nuclear power plants only emit 12 grams of carbon dioxide—enough to fill about

00:26.660 --> 00:28.860
three 2-liter soda bottles.

00:28.860 --> 00:36.140
Meanwhile, to produce the same amount of energy, coal plants emit 820 grams of CO2—about

00:36.140 --> 00:38.120
a full bathtub's worth.

00:38.120 --> 00:43.720
Factoring in the environmental cost of production, nuclear energy is cleaner than hydropower,

00:43.720 --> 00:48.480
than geothermal, than solar, than really any energy source except wind.

00:48.480 --> 00:53.180
But that doesn't necessarily mean nuclear is the long-term solution for the world because

00:53.180 --> 00:58.160
nuclear material is perhaps the most poisonous substance on earth.

00:58.160 --> 01:02.380
Two times in history have nuclear power plants leaked significant amounts of radiation.

01:02.380 --> 01:09.240
In 1986 in Chernobyl, Ukraine and in 2011 in Fukushima, Japan, 31 people died in Chernobyl

01:09.240 --> 01:15.240
with at least a further 4,000 expected to contract early lethal cancer due to radiation.

01:15.240 --> 01:19.900
Fukushima was better contained with only two deaths, both unrelated to radiation, and only

01:19.900 --> 01:26.880
130 early cancer deaths expected, but, additionally, each site still today has massive exclusion

01:26.920 --> 01:31.500
zones where humans cannot live due to ongoing radiation.

01:31.500 --> 01:35.540
Hundreds of thousands of people were displaced from their homes and will never be allowed

01:35.540 --> 01:36.540
to return.

01:36.540 --> 01:43.940
The economic damage of Chernobyl is estimated at nearly $250 billion—significantly more

01:43.940 --> 01:46.040
than the GDP of Ukraine.

01:46.040 --> 01:50.920
The Fukushima disaster, meanwhile, having taken place in a much more populated and developed

01:50.920 --> 01:56.440
area, is expected to set Japan back over $500 billion.

01:56.440 --> 01:59.000
A full 10% of their GDP.

01:59.000 --> 02:04.800
In addition, uranium, the element most commonly used in nuclear reactors, is not in limitless

02:04.800 --> 02:05.800
supply.

02:05.800 --> 02:11.860
Using present-day extraction methods, there's only about a 230 year supply of uranium left.

02:11.860 --> 02:15.980
Many would say nuclear is only a short-term solution to reduce carbon emissions until

02:15.980 --> 02:18.760
truly sustainable energy can become commonplace.

02:18.760 --> 02:23.040
But the biggest problem with nuclear energy is not the risk of meltdown, it's not the

02:23.040 --> 02:27.000
supply of uranium, it's this—nuclear waste.

02:27.000 --> 02:31.440
All current commercial nuclear power plants work through the process of nuclear fission.

02:31.440 --> 02:36.820
As a radioactive element decays, the individual atoms split into two, but when that happens

02:36.820 --> 02:39.220
the reaction also releases energy.

02:39.220 --> 02:43.260
There are plenty of different designs of nuclear reactors, but in general they capture the

02:43.260 --> 02:48.160
released energy by using it to heat up water into steam which runs through turbines that

02:48.160 --> 02:49.780
spin generators.

02:49.780 --> 02:54.900
The nuclear element used is typically uranium which, after about six to eight years of usage

02:54.900 --> 02:59.260
in a nuclear power plant, will have released enough of its energy that it is no longer

02:59.260 --> 03:03.820
useful in nuclear reactors, but that doesn't mean it's done emitting energy.

03:03.820 --> 03:09.520
The fuel rods will remain radioactive enough to emit a lethal dose for tens or hundreds

03:09.520 --> 03:11.800
of thousands of years past their removal.

03:11.800 --> 03:14.600
So the question is, what do you do with them?

03:14.600 --> 03:20.400
The answer is simple, put them somewhere where they can stay undisturbed, isolated, forever,

03:20.400 --> 03:22.060
but that's not all that easy.

03:22.060 --> 03:28.500
In fact, no nuclear waste worldwide is currently in what is considered long-term storage.

03:28.500 --> 03:33.480
Every bit of nuclear waste in existence is in temporary storage facilities to be used

03:33.480 --> 03:36.140
until a long-term solution is built.

03:36.140 --> 03:39.520
Most of that nuclear waste is stored in pools of water.

03:39.520 --> 03:44.180
Water does a decently good job of shielding radiation so this is an inexpensive and easy

03:44.180 --> 03:46.080
way of storing the rods.

03:46.080 --> 03:50.920
Usually, these pools are physically inside the nuclear power plants so, when spent fuel

03:50.920 --> 03:55.480
is removed from the reactor, it's put directly into the water and left there.

03:55.480 --> 03:59.440
The radioactive material, since it's still emitting energy, continues to heat up the

03:59.440 --> 04:04.180
water but cooling systems and pumps keep the water below boiling temperature, but to do

04:04.180 --> 04:06.280
that the plant needs power.

04:06.280 --> 04:11.840
If the power fails and the backup generators fail, the pumps and cooling systems stop working,

04:11.840 --> 04:14.360
so the water heats up and can boil off.

04:14.360 --> 04:19.140
The water is what blocks the radiation so, without water, the radiation just goes right

04:19.140 --> 04:20.740
out into the environment.

04:20.740 --> 04:24.080
In fact, exactly that happened at Fukushima.

04:24.080 --> 04:28.640
Both the primary and backup power sources failed so the pumps and cooling systems for

04:28.640 --> 04:32.320
the spent fuel pools couldn't run leaving the water to heat up.

04:32.320 --> 04:37.040
The situation was brought under control before enough water had boiled off to release significant

04:37.040 --> 04:41.360
amounts of radiation into the environment but had it not been, thousands could have

04:41.360 --> 04:42.480
been killed.

04:42.480 --> 04:47.940
Once nuclear waste has cooled down in storage pools for 10-20 years it typically is encased

04:47.940 --> 04:48.980
in casks.

04:48.980 --> 04:53.800
These concrete and steel containers block in radiation but this solution is far from

04:53.800 --> 04:54.800
permanent.

04:54.800 --> 04:59.400
It does not consider earthquakes, it cannot withstand tsunamis, and it would not work

04:59.400 --> 05:00.680
without humans.

05:00.680 --> 05:04.520
These casks require security and they require maintenance.

05:04.520 --> 05:09.080
Without humans, they could easily be damaged or breached over time and release radiation

05:09.080 --> 05:10.720
into the environment.

05:10.720 --> 05:15.600
Modern humans have only existed for about 200,000 years so one can hardly be sure that

05:15.600 --> 05:19.600
the species will survive for the millions of years that the toxic nuclear waste will

05:19.600 --> 05:21.240
continue to emit radiation.

05:21.240 --> 05:25.840
What's more, one can hardly expect that the dominant civilizations that have nuclear

05:25.840 --> 05:30.220
technology today will continue to exist for even thousands of years.

05:30.220 --> 05:35.300
The Roman Empire was once without a doubt the most powerful civilization on earth.

05:35.300 --> 05:39.860
Scholars even believe that it is the most powerful civilization to have ever existed

05:39.860 --> 05:44.680
on earth—more powerful than the US, than Europe, than any modern civilization, but

05:44.680 --> 05:47.900
it fell and so too will the west.

05:47.900 --> 05:53.140
Therefore, long-term nuclear waste storage needs to last longer than any political structure,

05:53.140 --> 05:57.880
it needs to work without the supervision of humans, it needs to be truly and unequivocally

05:57.880 --> 05:59.580
permanent.

05:59.580 --> 06:02.000
Finland is building just that.

06:02.000 --> 06:05.120
This region is largely devoid of natural disasters.

06:05.120 --> 06:09.020
It doesn't have earthquakes, it doesn't see tsunamis, it really doesn't encounter

06:09.020 --> 06:13.860
any natural phenomenon that could damage a nuclear waste storage site, especially if

06:13.860 --> 06:15.980
it's 1,500 feet underground.

06:15.980 --> 06:20.020
Beneath an island on the Finnish Baltic Sea coast, the country is digging.

06:20.020 --> 06:24.260
They're building the very first permanent nuclear waste storage facility in the world

06:24.260 --> 06:26.820
in the stable bedrock 1,500 feet below.

06:26.820 --> 06:31.560
Currently, they're just finishing their dig down, then very soon, in 2020, they'll

06:31.560 --> 06:33.540
start filling the facility with nuclear waste.

06:33.540 --> 06:37.540
They'll dig long tunnels with small holes in which they'll place casks of nuclear

06:37.540 --> 06:42.020
waste, then backfill the tunnels with clay to be left for an eternity.

06:42.020 --> 06:46.660
With this system, there's near-zero risk of nuclear material leaking out into the groundwater

06:46.660 --> 06:52.340
and, once it's filled in the year 2120, it can just be left forever.

06:52.340 --> 06:56.980
Because the material will be so far down and so difficult to get to, no human management

06:56.980 --> 06:58.820
will be necessary once completed.

06:58.820 --> 07:04.220
No security, no maintenance, nothing, which means it should be truly secure, but before

07:04.220 --> 07:08.620
leaving it, they do need to fight against one thing—human nature.

07:08.620 --> 07:12.820
As curious beings, it's hard to combat a person's urge of discovery.

07:12.820 --> 07:17.180
If someone finds a mysterious structure from thousands of years ago, it'd just be natural

07:17.180 --> 07:21.180
to want to open it up, and that's a problem for nuclear waste sites.

07:21.180 --> 07:24.220
We essentially did just that with the pyramids in Egypt.

07:24.220 --> 07:28.220
These structures were built as the final, permanent resting places for the elites of

07:28.220 --> 07:32.020
Egypt and we opened them up because we were curious.

07:32.020 --> 07:36.860
Opening the nuclear storage facilities would release radiation into a future civilization

07:36.860 --> 07:41.220
so we have to tell them to leave the sites alone, but that's easier said than done.

07:41.220 --> 07:45.360
The US Department of Energy commissioned a study on how to communicate the danger into

07:45.360 --> 07:46.580
the far future.

07:46.580 --> 07:51.560
The key is to create a message that conveys how uninteresting, how unimportant, and how

07:51.560 --> 07:53.740
dangerous nuclear waste is.

07:53.740 --> 07:56.260
They settled on the following text.

07:56.260 --> 07:58.460
Sending this message was important to us.

07:58.460 --> 08:01.480
We considered ourselves to be a powerful culture.

08:01.480 --> 08:06.220
This place is not a place of honor, no highly esteemed deed is commemorated here, nothing

08:06.220 --> 08:07.740
valued is here.

08:07.740 --> 08:10.760
What is here was dangerous and repulsive to us.

08:10.760 --> 08:13.080
This message is a warning about danger.

08:13.080 --> 08:17.580
The danger is in a particular location, it increases towards the center, the center of

08:17.580 --> 08:21.900
danger is here, of a particular size and shape, and below us.

08:21.900 --> 08:25.540
The danger is still present in your time as it was in ours.

08:25.540 --> 08:28.240
The danger is to the body and it can kill.

08:28.240 --> 08:31.300
The form of the danger is an emanation of energy.

08:31.300 --> 08:36.080
The danger is unleashed only if you substantially disturb this place physically.

08:36.080 --> 08:39.680
This place is best shunned and left uninhabited.

08:39.680 --> 08:44.300
The idea would be to translate a message like this into every United Nations language—Arabic,

08:44.300 --> 08:46.980
Chinese, English, French, Russian, and Spanish.

08:46.980 --> 08:51.060
There's a reasonable hope that, at least in the next couple thousand years, one of

08:51.060 --> 08:52.740
those languages would be understood.

08:52.740 --> 08:57.420
But in the scope of hundreds of thousands of years, there's just little expectation

08:57.420 --> 08:59.100
that these languages would survive.

08:59.100 --> 09:03.260
There's not even a reasonable expectation that humans will survive.

09:03.260 --> 09:07.780
So you need to convey the same message without language.

09:07.780 --> 09:12.920
What the study suggests is to further push the message by building a landscape that conveys

09:12.920 --> 09:13.920
danger.

09:13.920 --> 09:18.220
It could be a scene of thorns, or spikes, or forbidding blocks.

09:18.220 --> 09:23.300
To satiate the discoverer's curiosity, it's also suggested to add monoliths explaining

09:23.300 --> 09:26.080
the history of the site through pictographs.

09:26.080 --> 09:30.920
Also included would be images like this, engraved in stone, conveying that the substance has

09:30.920 --> 09:35.480
danger that would be passed onto humans if touched, but the difficulty of this is that

09:35.480 --> 09:40.300
it very well might not be humans exploring earth 100,000 years from now.

09:40.300 --> 09:45.360
It could be a species that doesn't recognize the likeness of what might be a long, extinct

09:45.360 --> 09:46.360
species.

09:46.360 --> 09:51.420
What some have suggested is to just let the site be forgotten, to not mark it at all,

09:51.420 --> 09:57.000
to just seal it up and leave, but having something that significant disappear isn't simple.

09:57.000 --> 10:02.020
The site in Finland is designed to not need security or oversight, but its current location

10:02.020 --> 10:06.280
is very well documented in a potentially irreversible way.

10:06.280 --> 10:11.260
With books and brains and the internet, records of the site might exist until at least the

10:11.260 --> 10:13.220
end of human civilization.

10:13.220 --> 10:20.460
To truly be forgotten, to truly be left as part of nature, so too must humans be forgotten.

10:20.460 --> 10:25.000
