4
00:00:10,020 --> 00:00:14,820
Nuclear energy is one of the cleanest, most efficient, and most available sources of power

5
00:00:14,820 --> 00:00:15,820
on earth.

6
00:00:15,820 --> 00:00:21,180
To generate 1 kilowatt-hour of energy—the amount an American household consumes in 48

7
00:00:21,180 --> 00:00:26,660
minutes—nuclear power plants only emit 12 grams of carbon dioxide—enough to fill about

8
00:00:26,660 --> 00:00:28,860
three 2-liter soda bottles.

9
00:00:28,860 --> 00:00:36,140
Meanwhile, to produce the same amount of energy, coal plants emit 820 grams of CO2—about

10
00:00:36,140 --> 00:00:38,120
a full bathtub's worth.

11
00:00:38,120 --> 00:00:43,720
Factoring in the environmental cost of production, nuclear energy is cleaner than hydropower,

12
00:00:43,720 --> 00:00:48,480
than geothermal, than solar, than really any energy source except wind.

13
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:53,180
But that doesn't necessarily mean nuclear is the long-term solution for the world because

14
00:00:53,180 --> 00:00:58,160
nuclear material is perhaps the most poisonous substance on earth.

15
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:02,380
Two times in history have nuclear power plants leaked significant amounts of radiation.

16
00:01:02,380 --> 00:01:09,240
In 1986 in Chernobyl, Ukraine and in 2011 in Fukushima, Japan, 31 people died in Chernobyl

17
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:15,240
with at least a further 4,000 expected to contract early lethal cancer due to radiation.

18
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:19,900
Fukushima was better contained with only two deaths, both unrelated to radiation, and only

19
00:01:19,900 --> 00:01:26,880
130 early cancer deaths expected, but, additionally, each site still today has massive exclusion

20
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:31,500
zones where humans cannot live due to ongoing radiation.

21
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:35,540
Hundreds of thousands of people were displaced from their homes and will never be allowed

22
00:01:35,540 --> 00:01:36,540
to return.

23
00:01:36,540 --> 00:01:43,940
The economic damage of Chernobyl is estimated at nearly $250 billion—significantly more

24
00:01:43,940 --> 00:01:46,040
than the GDP of Ukraine.

25
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:50,920
The Fukushima disaster, meanwhile, having taken place in a much more populated and developed

26
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:56,440
area, is expected to set Japan back over $500 billion.

27
00:01:56,440 --> 00:01:59,000
A full 10% of their GDP.

28
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:04,800
In addition, uranium, the element most commonly used in nuclear reactors, is not in limitless

29
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:05,800
supply.

30
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:11,860
Using present-day extraction methods, there's only about a 230 year supply of uranium left.

31
00:02:11,860 --> 00:02:15,980
Many would say nuclear is only a short-term solution to reduce carbon emissions until

32
00:02:15,980 --> 00:02:18,760
truly sustainable energy can become commonplace.

33
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:23,040
But the biggest problem with nuclear energy is not the risk of meltdown, it's not the

34
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:27,000
supply of uranium, it's this—nuclear waste.

35
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:31,440
All current commercial nuclear power plants work through the process of nuclear fission.

36
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:36,820
As a radioactive element decays, the individual atoms split into two, but when that happens

37
00:02:36,820 --> 00:02:39,220
the reaction also releases energy.

38
00:02:39,220 --> 00:02:43,260
There are plenty of different designs of nuclear reactors, but in general they capture the

39
00:02:43,260 --> 00:02:48,160
released energy by using it to heat up water into steam which runs through turbines that

40
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:49,780
spin generators.

41
00:02:49,780 --> 00:02:54,900
The nuclear element used is typically uranium which, after about six to eight years of usage

42
00:02:54,900 --> 00:02:59,260
in a nuclear power plant, will have released enough of its energy that it is no longer

43
00:02:59,260 --> 00:03:03,820
useful in nuclear reactors, but that doesn't mean it's done emitting energy.

44
00:03:03,820 --> 00:03:09,520
The fuel rods will remain radioactive enough to emit a lethal dose for tens or hundreds

45
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:11,800
of thousands of years past their removal.

46
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:14,600
So the question is, what do you do with them?

47
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:20,400
The answer is simple, put them somewhere where they can stay undisturbed, isolated, forever,

48
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:22,060
but that's not all that easy.

49
00:03:22,060 --> 00:03:28,500
In fact, no nuclear waste worldwide is currently in what is considered long-term storage.

50
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:33,480
Every bit of nuclear waste in existence is in temporary storage facilities to be used

51
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:36,140
until a long-term solution is built.

52
00:03:36,140 --> 00:03:39,520
Most of that nuclear waste is stored in pools of water.

53
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:44,180
Water does a decently good job of shielding radiation so this is an inexpensive and easy

54
00:03:44,180 --> 00:03:46,080
way of storing the rods.

55
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:50,920
Usually, these pools are physically inside the nuclear power plants so, when spent fuel

56
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:55,480
is removed from the reactor, it's put directly into the water and left there.

57
00:03:55,480 --> 00:03:59,440
The radioactive material, since it's still emitting energy, continues to heat up the

58
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:04,180
water but cooling systems and pumps keep the water below boiling temperature, but to do

59
00:04:04,180 --> 00:04:06,280
that the plant needs power.

60
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:11,840
If the power fails and the backup generators fail, the pumps and cooling systems stop working,

61
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:14,360
so the water heats up and can boil off.

62
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:19,140
The water is what blocks the radiation so, without water, the radiation just goes right

63
00:04:19,140 --> 00:04:20,740
out into the environment.

64
00:04:20,740 --> 00:04:24,080
In fact, exactly that happened at Fukushima.

65
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:28,640
Both the primary and backup power sources failed so the pumps and cooling systems for

66
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:32,320
the spent fuel pools couldn't run leaving the water to heat up.

67
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:37,040
The situation was brought under control before enough water had boiled off to release significant

68
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:41,360
amounts of radiation into the environment but had it not been, thousands could have

69
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:42,480
been killed.

70
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:47,940
Once nuclear waste has cooled down in storage pools for 10-20 years it typically is encased

71
00:04:47,940 --> 00:04:48,980
in casks.

72
00:04:48,980 --> 00:04:53,800
These concrete and steel containers block in radiation but this solution is far from

73
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:54,800
permanent.

74
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:59,400
It does not consider earthquakes, it cannot withstand tsunamis, and it would not work

75
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:00,680
without humans.

76
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:04,520
These casks require security and they require maintenance.

77
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:09,080
Without humans, they could easily be damaged or breached over time and release radiation

78
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:10,720
into the environment.

79
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:15,600
Modern humans have only existed for about 200,000 years so one can hardly be sure that

80
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:19,600
the species will survive for the millions of years that the toxic nuclear waste will

81
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:21,240
continue to emit radiation.

82
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:25,840
What's more, one can hardly expect that the dominant civilizations that have nuclear

83
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:30,220
technology today will continue to exist for even thousands of years.

84
00:05:30,220 --> 00:05:35,300
The Roman Empire was once without a doubt the most powerful civilization on earth.

85
00:05:35,300 --> 00:05:39,860
Scholars even believe that it is the most powerful civilization to have ever existed

86
00:05:39,860 --> 00:05:44,680
on earth—more powerful than the US, than Europe, than any modern civilization, but

87
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:47,900
it fell and so too will the west.

88
00:05:47,900 --> 00:05:53,140
Therefore, long-term nuclear waste storage needs to last longer than any political structure,

89
00:05:53,140 --> 00:05:57,880
it needs to work without the supervision of humans, it needs to be truly and unequivocally

90
00:05:57,880 --> 00:05:59,580
permanent.

91
00:05:59,580 --> 00:06:02,000
Finland is building just that.

92
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:05,120
This region is largely devoid of natural disasters.

93
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:09,020
It doesn't have earthquakes, it doesn't see tsunamis, it really doesn't encounter

94
00:06:09,020 --> 00:06:13,860
any natural phenomenon that could damage a nuclear waste storage site, especially if

95
00:06:13,860 --> 00:06:15,980
it's 1,500 feet underground.

96
00:06:15,980 --> 00:06:20,020
Beneath an island on the Finnish Baltic Sea coast, the country is digging.

97
00:06:20,020 --> 00:06:24,260
They're building the very first permanent nuclear waste storage facility in the world

98
00:06:24,260 --> 00:06:26,820
in the stable bedrock 1,500 feet below.

99
00:06:26,820 --> 00:06:31,560
Currently, they're just finishing their dig down, then very soon, in 2020, they'll

100
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:33,540
start filling the facility with nuclear waste.

101
00:06:33,540 --> 00:06:37,540
They'll dig long tunnels with small holes in which they'll place casks of nuclear

102
00:06:37,540 --> 00:06:42,020
waste, then backfill the tunnels with clay to be left for an eternity.

103
00:06:42,020 --> 00:06:46,660
With this system, there's near-zero risk of nuclear material leaking out into the groundwater

104
00:06:46,660 --> 00:06:52,340
and, once it's filled in the year 2120, it can just be left forever.

105
00:06:52,340 --> 00:06:56,980
Because the material will be so far down and so difficult to get to, no human management

106
00:06:56,980 --> 00:06:58,820
will be necessary once completed.

107
00:06:58,820 --> 00:07:04,220
No security, no maintenance, nothing, which means it should be truly secure, but before

108
00:07:04,220 --> 00:07:08,620
leaving it, they do need to fight against one thing—human nature.

109
00:07:08,620 --> 00:07:12,820
As curious beings, it's hard to combat a person's urge of discovery.

110
00:07:12,820 --> 00:07:17,180
If someone finds a mysterious structure from thousands of years ago, it'd just be natural

111
00:07:17,180 --> 00:07:21,180
to want to open it up, and that's a problem for nuclear waste sites.

112
00:07:21,180 --> 00:07:24,220
We essentially did just that with the pyramids in Egypt.

113
00:07:24,220 --> 00:07:28,220
These structures were built as the final, permanent resting places for the elites of

114
00:07:28,220 --> 00:07:32,020
Egypt and we opened them up because we were curious.

115
00:07:32,020 --> 00:07:36,860
Opening the nuclear storage facilities would release radiation into a future civilization

116
00:07:36,860 --> 00:07:41,220
so we have to tell them to leave the sites alone, but that's easier said than done.

117
00:07:41,220 --> 00:07:45,360
The US Department of Energy commissioned a study on how to communicate the danger into

118
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:46,580
the far future.

119
00:07:46,580 --> 00:07:51,560
The key is to create a message that conveys how uninteresting, how unimportant, and how

120
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:53,740
dangerous nuclear waste is.

121
00:07:53,740 --> 00:07:56,260
They settled on the following text.

122
00:07:56,260 --> 00:07:58,460
Sending this message was important to us.

123
00:07:58,460 --> 00:08:01,480
We considered ourselves to be a powerful culture.

124
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:06,220
This place is not a place of honor, no highly esteemed deed is commemorated here, nothing

125
00:08:06,220 --> 00:08:07,740
valued is here.

126
00:08:07,740 --> 00:08:10,760
What is here was dangerous and repulsive to us.

127
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:13,080
This message is a warning about danger.

128
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:17,580
The danger is in a particular location, it increases towards the center, the center of

129
00:08:17,580 --> 00:08:21,900
danger is here, of a particular size and shape, and below us.

130
00:08:21,900 --> 00:08:25,540
The danger is still present in your time as it was in ours.

131
00:08:25,540 --> 00:08:28,240
The danger is to the body and it can kill.

132
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:31,300
The form of the danger is an emanation of energy.

133
00:08:31,300 --> 00:08:36,080
The danger is unleashed only if you substantially disturb this place physically.

134
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:39,680
This place is best shunned and left uninhabited.

135
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:44,300
The idea would be to translate a message like this into every United Nations language—Arabic,

136
00:08:44,300 --> 00:08:46,980
Chinese, English, French, Russian, and Spanish.

137
00:08:46,980 --> 00:08:51,060
There's a reasonable hope that, at least in the next couple thousand years, one of

138
00:08:51,060 --> 00:08:52,740
those languages would be understood.

139
00:08:52,740 --> 00:08:57,420
But in the scope of hundreds of thousands of years, there's just little expectation

140
00:08:57,420 --> 00:08:59,100
that these languages would survive.

141
00:08:59,100 --> 00:09:03,260
There's not even a reasonable expectation that humans will survive.

142
00:09:03,260 --> 00:09:07,780
So you need to convey the same message without language.

143
00:09:07,780 --> 00:09:12,920
What the study suggests is to further push the message by building a landscape that conveys

144
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:13,920
danger.

145
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:18,220
It could be a scene of thorns, or spikes, or forbidding blocks.

146
00:09:18,220 --> 00:09:23,300
To satiate the discoverer's curiosity, it's also suggested to add monoliths explaining

147
00:09:23,300 --> 00:09:26,080
the history of the site through pictographs.

148
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:30,920
Also included would be images like this, engraved in stone, conveying that the substance has

149
00:09:30,920 --> 00:09:35,480
danger that would be passed onto humans if touched, but the difficulty of this is that

150
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:40,300
it very well might not be humans exploring earth 100,000 years from now.

151
00:09:40,300 --> 00:09:45,360
It could be a species that doesn't recognize the likeness of what might be a long, extinct

152
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:46,360
species.

153
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:51,420
What some have suggested is to just let the site be forgotten, to not mark it at all,

154
00:09:51,420 --> 00:09:57,000
to just seal it up and leave, but having something that significant disappear isn't simple.

155
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:02,020
The site in Finland is designed to not need security or oversight, but its current location

156
00:10:02,020 --> 00:10:06,280
is very well documented in a potentially irreversible way.

157
00:10:06,280 --> 00:10:11,260
With books and brains and the internet, records of the site might exist until at least the

158
00:10:11,260 --> 00:10:13,220
end of human civilization.

159
00:10:13,220 --> 00:10:20,460
To truly be forgotten, to truly be left as part of nature, so too must humans be forgotten.

160
00:10:20,460 --> 00:10:25,000
If you want to learn about clean energy or anything else, you should try Brilliant.

161
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:30,040
They have a fantastic course on solar energy complete with approachable explanations, straightforward

162
00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:32,280
graphics and thought-provoking puzzles.

163
00:10:32,280 --> 00:10:36,460
I've really been enjoying Brilliant because their courses do a great job of providing

164
00:10:36,460 --> 00:10:40,740
