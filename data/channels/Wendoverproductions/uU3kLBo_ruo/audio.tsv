10020	14820	Nuclear energy is one of the cleanest, most efficient, and most available sources of power
14820	15820	on earth.
15820	21180	To generate 1 kilowatt-hour of energy—the amount an American household consumes in 48
21180	26660	minutes—nuclear power plants only emit 12 grams of carbon dioxide—enough to fill about
26660	28860	three 2-liter soda bottles.
28860	36140	Meanwhile, to produce the same amount of energy, coal plants emit 820 grams of CO2—about
36140	38120	a full bathtub's worth.
38120	43720	Factoring in the environmental cost of production, nuclear energy is cleaner than hydropower,
43720	48480	than geothermal, than solar, than really any energy source except wind.
48480	53180	But that doesn't necessarily mean nuclear is the long-term solution for the world because
53180	58160	nuclear material is perhaps the most poisonous substance on earth.
58160	62380	Two times in history have nuclear power plants leaked significant amounts of radiation.
62380	69240	In 1986 in Chernobyl, Ukraine and in 2011 in Fukushima, Japan, 31 people died in Chernobyl
69240	75240	with at least a further 4,000 expected to contract early lethal cancer due to radiation.
75240	79900	Fukushima was better contained with only two deaths, both unrelated to radiation, and only
79900	86880	130 early cancer deaths expected, but, additionally, each site still today has massive exclusion
86920	91500	zones where humans cannot live due to ongoing radiation.
91500	95540	Hundreds of thousands of people were displaced from their homes and will never be allowed
95540	96540	to return.
96540	103940	The economic damage of Chernobyl is estimated at nearly $250 billion—significantly more
103940	106040	than the GDP of Ukraine.
106040	110920	The Fukushima disaster, meanwhile, having taken place in a much more populated and developed
110920	116440	area, is expected to set Japan back over $500 billion.
116440	119000	A full 10% of their GDP.
119000	124800	In addition, uranium, the element most commonly used in nuclear reactors, is not in limitless
124800	125800	supply.
125800	131860	Using present-day extraction methods, there's only about a 230 year supply of uranium left.
131860	135980	Many would say nuclear is only a short-term solution to reduce carbon emissions until
135980	138760	truly sustainable energy can become commonplace.
138760	143040	But the biggest problem with nuclear energy is not the risk of meltdown, it's not the
143040	147000	supply of uranium, it's this—nuclear waste.
147000	151440	All current commercial nuclear power plants work through the process of nuclear fission.
151440	156820	As a radioactive element decays, the individual atoms split into two, but when that happens
156820	159220	the reaction also releases energy.
159220	163260	There are plenty of different designs of nuclear reactors, but in general they capture the
163260	168160	released energy by using it to heat up water into steam which runs through turbines that
168160	169780	spin generators.
169780	174900	The nuclear element used is typically uranium which, after about six to eight years of usage
174900	179260	in a nuclear power plant, will have released enough of its energy that it is no longer
179260	183820	useful in nuclear reactors, but that doesn't mean it's done emitting energy.
183820	189520	The fuel rods will remain radioactive enough to emit a lethal dose for tens or hundreds
189520	191800	of thousands of years past their removal.
191800	194600	So the question is, what do you do with them?
194600	200400	The answer is simple, put them somewhere where they can stay undisturbed, isolated, forever,
200400	202060	but that's not all that easy.
202060	208500	In fact, no nuclear waste worldwide is currently in what is considered long-term storage.
208500	213480	Every bit of nuclear waste in existence is in temporary storage facilities to be used
213480	216140	until a long-term solution is built.
216140	219520	Most of that nuclear waste is stored in pools of water.
219520	224180	Water does a decently good job of shielding radiation so this is an inexpensive and easy
224180	226080	way of storing the rods.
226080	230920	Usually, these pools are physically inside the nuclear power plants so, when spent fuel
230920	235480	is removed from the reactor, it's put directly into the water and left there.
235480	239440	The radioactive material, since it's still emitting energy, continues to heat up the
239440	244180	water but cooling systems and pumps keep the water below boiling temperature, but to do
244180	246280	that the plant needs power.
246280	251840	If the power fails and the backup generators fail, the pumps and cooling systems stop working,
251840	254360	so the water heats up and can boil off.
254360	259140	The water is what blocks the radiation so, without water, the radiation just goes right
259140	260740	out into the environment.
260740	264080	In fact, exactly that happened at Fukushima.
264080	268640	Both the primary and backup power sources failed so the pumps and cooling systems for
268640	272320	the spent fuel pools couldn't run leaving the water to heat up.
272320	277040	The situation was brought under control before enough water had boiled off to release significant
277040	281360	amounts of radiation into the environment but had it not been, thousands could have
281360	282480	been killed.
282480	287940	Once nuclear waste has cooled down in storage pools for 10-20 years it typically is encased
287940	288980	in casks.
288980	293800	These concrete and steel containers block in radiation but this solution is far from
293800	294800	permanent.
294800	299400	It does not consider earthquakes, it cannot withstand tsunamis, and it would not work
299400	300680	without humans.
300680	304520	These casks require security and they require maintenance.
304520	309080	Without humans, they could easily be damaged or breached over time and release radiation
309080	310720	into the environment.
310720	315600	Modern humans have only existed for about 200,000 years so one can hardly be sure that
315600	319600	the species will survive for the millions of years that the toxic nuclear waste will
319600	321240	continue to emit radiation.
321240	325840	What's more, one can hardly expect that the dominant civilizations that have nuclear
325840	330220	technology today will continue to exist for even thousands of years.
330220	335300	The Roman Empire was once without a doubt the most powerful civilization on earth.
335300	339860	Scholars even believe that it is the most powerful civilization to have ever existed
339860	344680	on earth—more powerful than the US, than Europe, than any modern civilization, but
344680	347900	it fell and so too will the west.
347900	353140	Therefore, long-term nuclear waste storage needs to last longer than any political structure,
353140	357880	it needs to work without the supervision of humans, it needs to be truly and unequivocally
357880	359580	permanent.
359580	362000	Finland is building just that.
362000	365120	This region is largely devoid of natural disasters.
365120	369020	It doesn't have earthquakes, it doesn't see tsunamis, it really doesn't encounter
369020	373860	any natural phenomenon that could damage a nuclear waste storage site, especially if
373860	375980	it's 1,500 feet underground.
375980	380020	Beneath an island on the Finnish Baltic Sea coast, the country is digging.
380020	384260	They're building the very first permanent nuclear waste storage facility in the world
384260	386820	in the stable bedrock 1,500 feet below.
386820	391560	Currently, they're just finishing their dig down, then very soon, in 2020, they'll
391560	393540	start filling the facility with nuclear waste.
393540	397540	They'll dig long tunnels with small holes in which they'll place casks of nuclear
397540	402020	waste, then backfill the tunnels with clay to be left for an eternity.
402020	406660	With this system, there's near-zero risk of nuclear material leaking out into the groundwater
406660	412340	and, once it's filled in the year 2120, it can just be left forever.
412340	416980	Because the material will be so far down and so difficult to get to, no human management
416980	418820	will be necessary once completed.
418820	424220	No security, no maintenance, nothing, which means it should be truly secure, but before
424220	428620	leaving it, they do need to fight against one thing—human nature.
428620	432820	As curious beings, it's hard to combat a person's urge of discovery.
432820	437180	If someone finds a mysterious structure from thousands of years ago, it'd just be natural
437180	441180	to want to open it up, and that's a problem for nuclear waste sites.
441180	444220	We essentially did just that with the pyramids in Egypt.
444220	448220	These structures were built as the final, permanent resting places for the elites of
448220	452020	Egypt and we opened them up because we were curious.
452020	456860	Opening the nuclear storage facilities would release radiation into a future civilization
456860	461220	so we have to tell them to leave the sites alone, but that's easier said than done.
461220	465360	The US Department of Energy commissioned a study on how to communicate the danger into
465360	466580	the far future.
466580	471560	The key is to create a message that conveys how uninteresting, how unimportant, and how
471560	473740	dangerous nuclear waste is.
473740	476260	They settled on the following text.
476260	478460	Sending this message was important to us.
478460	481480	We considered ourselves to be a powerful culture.
481480	486220	This place is not a place of honor, no highly esteemed deed is commemorated here, nothing
486220	487740	valued is here.
487740	490760	What is here was dangerous and repulsive to us.
490760	493080	This message is a warning about danger.
493080	497580	The danger is in a particular location, it increases towards the center, the center of
497580	501900	danger is here, of a particular size and shape, and below us.
501900	505540	The danger is still present in your time as it was in ours.
505540	508240	The danger is to the body and it can kill.
508240	511300	The form of the danger is an emanation of energy.
511300	516080	The danger is unleashed only if you substantially disturb this place physically.
516080	519680	This place is best shunned and left uninhabited.
519680	524300	The idea would be to translate a message like this into every United Nations language—Arabic,
524300	526980	Chinese, English, French, Russian, and Spanish.
526980	531060	There's a reasonable hope that, at least in the next couple thousand years, one of
531060	532740	those languages would be understood.
532740	537420	But in the scope of hundreds of thousands of years, there's just little expectation
537420	539100	that these languages would survive.
539100	543260	There's not even a reasonable expectation that humans will survive.
543260	547780	So you need to convey the same message without language.
547780	552920	What the study suggests is to further push the message by building a landscape that conveys
552920	553920	danger.
553920	558220	It could be a scene of thorns, or spikes, or forbidding blocks.
558220	563300	To satiate the discoverer's curiosity, it's also suggested to add monoliths explaining
563300	566080	the history of the site through pictographs.
566080	570920	Also included would be images like this, engraved in stone, conveying that the substance has
570920	575480	danger that would be passed onto humans if touched, but the difficulty of this is that
575480	580300	it very well might not be humans exploring earth 100,000 years from now.
580300	585360	It could be a species that doesn't recognize the likeness of what might be a long, extinct
585360	586360	species.
586360	591420	What some have suggested is to just let the site be forgotten, to not mark it at all,
591420	597000	to just seal it up and leave, but having something that significant disappear isn't simple.
597000	602020	The site in Finland is designed to not need security or oversight, but its current location
602020	606280	is very well documented in a potentially irreversible way.
606280	611260	With books and brains and the internet, records of the site might exist until at least the
611260	613220	end of human civilization.
613220	620460	To truly be forgotten, to truly be left as part of nature, so too must humans be forgotten.
