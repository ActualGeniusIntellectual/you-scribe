4
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:17,160
Just about once every three days, somewhere in the world, a large commercial passenger

5
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:19,320
plane crashes.

6
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:24,460
Most of these are not hugely catastrophic, because most of these are fatality-free.

7
00:00:24,460 --> 00:00:31,580
Of the 1,070 recorded crashes in the 2010s decade, only 112 proved fatal.

8
00:00:31,580 --> 00:00:36,740
Even of these, the vast majority of passengers survive an average fatal crash.

9
00:00:36,740 --> 00:00:42,940
In fact, half of all deaths from airline crashes in the previous decade are from just 12 incidents.

10
00:00:42,940 --> 00:00:49,140
That's to say, most fatal aircraft accidents are not the kinds you see in movies—the

11
00:00:49,140 --> 00:00:52,660
kinds where there are few or no survivors.

12
00:00:52,660 --> 00:00:58,760
Most are more minor incidents, with just one or two or a few more unlucky victims.

13
00:00:58,760 --> 00:01:01,940
The industry, though, does not view them that way.

14
00:01:01,940 --> 00:01:06,600
The truth is that people fear airplanes an irrational amount, so in order for air travel

15
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:12,140
to be as commonplace as it is, they require a standard of safety far higher than any other

16
00:01:12,140 --> 00:01:14,340
method of transport.

17
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:18,260
Safety and profitability go hand in hand for airlines.

18
00:01:18,260 --> 00:01:24,380
Despite this, though, accidents are effectively an inevitability for any of the largest airlines.

19
00:01:24,380 --> 00:01:29,940
Statistically, some of these largest airlines are also some of the safest, yet none are

20
00:01:29,940 --> 00:01:31,860
100% safe.

21
00:01:31,860 --> 00:01:36,220
Therefore, with enough flying, an accident will happen.

22
00:01:36,220 --> 00:01:40,680
All ten of the world's largest airlines have had fatal accidents in their histories

23
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:45,700
and so, with this level of inevitability, airlines must have a strictly defined plan

24
00:01:45,700 --> 00:01:49,140
for what to do after one of their airplanes crash.

25
00:01:49,140 --> 00:01:53,220
So, let's say an accident happens.

26
00:01:53,220 --> 00:01:57,380
This will almost certainly have something to do with landing or taking off.

27
00:01:57,380 --> 00:02:02,640
The overwhelming majority of accidents involve the runway, however, if an accident is fatal,

28
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:06,940
it is much more likely that it has to do with a loss of control in flight or a controlled

29
00:02:06,940 --> 00:02:08,800
crash into terrain.

30
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:14,860
Runway accidents represent more than 90% of accidents, but only account for 25% of fatal

31
00:02:14,860 --> 00:02:15,860
accidents.

32
00:02:15,860 --> 00:02:20,540
The airline really never is the first responder to an accident.

33
00:02:20,540 --> 00:02:25,660
That is typically firefighters and other emergency personnel, but as soon as word of an accident

34
00:02:25,660 --> 00:02:29,700
reaches them, the airline will begin to mobilize.

35
00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:33,580
Almost every airline out there will have what's called a go team.

36
00:02:33,580 --> 00:02:37,420
This is a group of people, typically working at the airline's headquarters, who train

37
00:02:37,420 --> 00:02:41,940
to be part of the crisis response function on top of their ordinary jobs.

38
00:02:42,020 --> 00:02:46,300
With larger airlines, this go team can be comprised of as many as hundreds of individuals

39
00:02:46,300 --> 00:02:49,220
filling a huge variety of functions.

40
00:02:49,220 --> 00:02:53,060
Larger long-haul airlines might also have smaller teams comprised of people working

41
00:02:53,060 --> 00:02:57,060
at their outstations who can more quickly get to crash sites while the main team travels

42
00:02:57,060 --> 00:02:58,540
from a headquarters.

43
00:02:58,540 --> 00:03:03,180
Now, each airline will have different procedures and protocols, but there are loose standards

44
00:03:03,180 --> 00:03:04,820
adopted by all.

45
00:03:04,820 --> 00:03:08,680
Typically within three to four hours of a crash, an airline's go team will have assembled

46
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:11,180
and taken off from the headquarters airport.

47
00:03:11,220 --> 00:03:16,460
Usually, a standby flight crew and aircraft would be used for this dedicated flight.

48
00:03:16,460 --> 00:03:19,220
With them, they'd bring a go kit.

49
00:03:19,220 --> 00:03:23,060
Considering accidents can happen quite literally anywhere, this would include all sorts of

50
00:03:23,060 --> 00:03:27,900
things like satellite communications equipment, food, water, cooking equipment, personal protective

51
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:31,700
equipment, warm clothing, tents, generators, tools, and more.

52
00:03:31,700 --> 00:03:36,340
The team's personnel are typically split up into dealing with three main areas—crisis

53
00:03:36,340 --> 00:03:39,800
support, humanitarian support, and communications.

54
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:43,520
Each of these would likely be split up into a forward team and rear team.

55
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:47,980
If the crash occurs in a remote location, for example, the forward team, including the

56
00:03:47,980 --> 00:03:52,320
most essential members of each of the larger teams, would likely go to the crash site and

57
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:56,120
set up a literal base camp using the equipment in the go kit.

58
00:03:56,120 --> 00:04:01,400
Meanwhile, the rear team might set up in the nearest town with accommodations and facilities.

59
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:07,320
At the crash site, a triage area is set up away and upwind from the aircraft wreckage.

60
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:12,480
This might be done by some of the crisis response go team members or by emergency personnel.

61
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:18,560
There, individuals would be split up into three groups—deceased, injured, and uninjured.

62
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:22,660
The deceased and injured would typically be cared for by firefighters, medics, and other

63
00:04:22,660 --> 00:04:27,040
emergency personnel whereas the airline go team would likely deal with the uninjured

64
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:28,100
passengers.

65
00:04:28,100 --> 00:04:32,640
The rear go team will have, meanwhile, set up a survivor reception center, usually at

66
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:36,360
a nearby hotel, and arrange transportation to that site.

67
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:40,600
The largest group in the go team is typically the humanitarian assistance team which is

68
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:45,400
made up of volunteers among the airline's customer service staff—flight attendants,

69
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:46,900
airport agents, and others.

70
00:04:46,900 --> 00:04:50,760
By grouping the passengers together in one facility, the airline separates them from

71
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:55,660
media and centralizes them for investigatory interviews and support functions.

72
00:04:55,660 --> 00:04:59,840
The aircraft's surviving crew will typically be dealt with by a different team which would

73
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:03,520
bring them to a different facility than the passengers, which is recommended for both

74
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:06,240
legal and public relations reasons.

75
00:05:06,540 --> 00:05:10,260
Another subset of the humanitarian assistance team will set up a facility for friends and

76
00:05:10,260 --> 00:05:13,380
family of the passengers near the accident site.

77
00:05:13,380 --> 00:05:17,720
They might also set up a separate facility at the origin or destination of the flight,

78
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:20,480
where large clusters of friends and family might be.

79
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:24,200
The individuals there would be provided with updates as a group, and then would be sorted

80
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:28,240
so that friends and families of survivors would be brought to an area to reunite, whereas

81
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:32,380
others might be broke in the news that their family member or friend has died.

82
00:05:32,380 --> 00:05:36,600
The role of these family assistance centers is amplified in the case of crashes where

83
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:41,080
there is a significant long-term search and rescue operation, as is often the case with

84
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:42,340
crashes into the ocean.

85
00:05:42,340 --> 00:05:47,140
In the case of the Malaysian Airlines Flight 370 disappearance, for example, the family

86
00:05:47,140 --> 00:05:51,040
assistance centers were in operation for two months.

87
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:55,100
The passenger and family assistance centers might need to house hundreds and thousands

88
00:05:55,100 --> 00:05:59,660
of individuals respectively, so the setup and functions of these is likely defined prior

89
00:05:59,660 --> 00:06:01,700
to any accident.

90
00:06:01,700 --> 00:06:06,260
Airlines will decide, for example, that they need a general lounge, a faith area, a psychological

91
00:06:06,260 --> 00:06:11,700
assistance area, a press area, a phone and internet area, and more and more beforehand,

92
00:06:11,700 --> 00:06:15,340
and then it's just about deciding which area goes where once a location for the facility

93
00:06:15,340 --> 00:06:17,000
is identified.

94
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:21,480
With this and all other response efforts, actions are proceduralized so that each member

95
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:26,140
of the team knows what to do even in a fast-moving, chaotic scenario.

96
00:06:26,140 --> 00:06:30,860
Away from the crash site, airlines will set up a crisis command center in their headquarters,

97
00:06:30,860 --> 00:06:34,820
including executives from each aspect of the airline's operations in order to coordinate

98
00:06:34,820 --> 00:06:35,820
their response.

99
00:06:35,820 --> 00:06:40,380
In addition, a call center is often quickly set up and staffed to answer questions from

100
00:06:40,380 --> 00:06:43,260
family and friends of passengers and the media.

101
00:06:43,260 --> 00:06:47,900
This is just a small part of the overall communications efforts, though, because more than anything

102
00:06:47,900 --> 00:06:53,300
else, probably the best thing an airline can do for themselves after an accident is communicate.

103
00:06:53,300 --> 00:06:59,380
That's why the third primary aspect of a GO team, beyond crisis and humanitarian response,

104
00:06:59,380 --> 00:07:01,420
is communications.

105
00:07:01,420 --> 00:07:06,420
After one of their aircraft crash, an airline is concerned with business continuity—they're

106
00:07:06,420 --> 00:07:10,360
concerned with how they'll emerge from the other end of the incident—and so their communications

107
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:12,980
have to be strategic.

108
00:07:12,980 --> 00:07:17,520
Crisis communications is a subset of public relations intended to minimize reputational

109
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:20,700
damage after an incident at a company.

110
00:07:20,700 --> 00:07:25,580
Within this, airlines want to be sure that, to the extent possible, they are able to control

111
00:07:25,580 --> 00:07:26,960
the narrative.

112
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:32,200
That means they need to communicate fast and loudly to drown out any other noise.

113
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:37,360
So, they put communications GO team members on-site to be able to disseminate accurate

114
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:42,560
information as fast as possible to the media, survivors, and family and friends.

115
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:47,080
There will also, however, be a team back at the airline HQ that will have to make more

116
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:50,240
methodical, strategic communications decisions.

117
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:55,280
Now, at the end of the day, there ends up being two main options for responding to an

118
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:59,160
incident—accepting blame or deferring blame.

119
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:03,180
Academic research into the matter shows that taking responsibility early typically leads

120
00:08:03,180 --> 00:08:07,200
to a better public response and actually tends to decrease the size of settlements that end

121
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:12,900
up getting paid out, however, the risk one runs is that, by accepting responsibility,

122
00:08:12,900 --> 00:08:15,720
this can open up a company to legal consequences.

123
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:21,160
Therefore, despite overwhelming evidence that it is not the prudent move, organizations

124
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:26,360
will often defer responsibility until it is absolutely certain that it is indeed their

125
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:27,420
fault.

126
00:08:27,420 --> 00:08:31,700
If it is absolutely sure that an accident is not the airline's fault, such as in the

127
00:08:31,700 --> 00:08:36,620
case of aircraft manufacturing defects, deferring blame can actually shift public sentiment

128
00:08:36,620 --> 00:08:40,980
to position the airline as a victim themselves, but the evidence for such cases typically

129
00:08:40,980 --> 00:08:46,280
only becomes conclusive after years of investigation, so in the immediate aftermath of a crash it

130
00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:49,000
can seem to the public as evading responsibility.

131
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:55,860
Therefore, deciding whether to take or shift blame is quite the tough choice for airlines.

132
00:08:55,860 --> 00:09:01,720
One of the recent case studies in crisis communication involved Southwest Airlines Flight 1308 in

133
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:02,720
2018.

134
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:07,600
Shortly upon reaching cruise after its departure from LaGuardia airport, its left engine failed

135
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:10,840
and fragments were flung into the aircraft fuselage.

136
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:15,640
With that, one window was broken and, due to the rapid decompression and fast-moving

137
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:19,780
debris, the passenger sitting next to that window died from her injuries.

138
00:09:19,780 --> 00:09:24,000
The aircraft ended up landing safely, and there were only minor injuries among the other

139
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,780
passengers, but for Southwest this was a major crisis.

140
00:09:27,780 --> 00:09:34,160
It was the first aircraft accident fatality in the US since 2009, and their first ever.

141
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:39,160
Southwest essentially took responsibility right away—giving each passenger $5,000

142
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:41,920
in cash and $1,000 in flight credits.

143
00:09:42,300 --> 00:09:46,760
They also, very quickly, issued empathetic, personable statements which, combined with

144
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:51,360
their prior positive reputation, were effective in persuading the public that they were truly

145
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:52,440
sorry.

146
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:56,320
The company also paused all marketing for a month to let the sensitive situation fade

147
00:09:56,320 --> 00:10:02,160
away in public discourse, so, all told, this incident and its response cost them about

148
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:04,500
$100 million.

149
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:09,040
In the end, after the investigation was fully completed, it was determined that it probably

150
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:11,000
wasn't Southwest's fault.

151
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:16,320
The accident was caused by a tiny, largely invisible fatigue fracture on one of the engine's

152
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:17,320
fan blades.

153
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:21,300
Southwest followed all maintenance and inspection protocols for this aircraft, but for some

154
00:10:21,300 --> 00:10:23,800
reason these didn't catch the issue.

155
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:27,440
Therefore, the protocols were updated after the fact.

156
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:32,140
Southwest went for the expensive, yet effective crisis communication method.

157
00:10:32,140 --> 00:10:36,360
If they had deferred blame, they might have been able to lose less money, but if in the

158
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:41,400
end it was found that they should bear some blame, this could result in significant reputational

159
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:42,680
damage.

160
00:10:42,680 --> 00:10:47,200
In the immediate response to a plane crash, the incentives of the airline and victims

161
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:52,820
are often aligned because the public responds positively to positive treatment of the victims.

162
00:10:52,820 --> 00:10:58,880
It is later on, though, where incentives increasingly split—victims often look for compensation,

163
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:01,600
airlines look to minimize their financial responsibility.

164
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:06,240
By that time, the public is no longer interested in a plane crash.

165
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:10,680
Crashes are interesting when there's a burning pile of debris, not when a bunch of lawyers

166
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:12,400
are sitting in a courtroom.

167
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:17,680
Therefore, that's exactly why airlines put a huge, disproportionate amount of planning,

168
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:21,560
money, and effort into the phase of response with the burning pile of debris.

169
00:11:21,560 --> 00:11:27,480
It's the most effective use of those resources and, at the end of the day, to airlines, airplane

170
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:32,300
crashes are a financial problem.

171
00:11:32,300 --> 00:11:36,900
If you're anything like me, you listen to music, podcasts, and audiobooks constantly

172
00:11:36,900 --> 00:11:38,140
while working.

173
00:11:38,140 --> 00:11:42,240
That means that you probably have earbuds in for many hours per day, so it's worth

174
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:45,200
making sure the ones you use are good.

175
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:50,420
Having now tried them, I can attest that Raycon's wireless earbuds are good—they have great

176
00:11:50,420 --> 00:11:54,300
audio quality and are super comfortable, yet they also stayed in perfectly while I was

177
00:11:54,300 --> 00:11:56,680
out on a run, which was impressive.

178
00:11:56,680 --> 00:12:01,980
Their everyday E25s have six hours of playtime, seamless Bluetooth pairing, a compact noise

179
00:12:01,980 --> 00:12:06,540
isolating fit, and, most impressively, they cost about half as much as comparable premium

180
00:12:06,540 --> 00:12:07,960
wireless earbuds.

181
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:11,820
On top of that, they're an even better deal considering they're giving Wendover viewers

182
00:12:11,820 --> 00:12:17,020
15% off by going to buyraycon.com slash Wendover and you'll be supporting the channel with

183
00:12:17,020 --> 00:12:17,820
