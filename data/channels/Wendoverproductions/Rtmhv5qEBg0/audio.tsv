11360	17160	Just about once every three days, somewhere in the world, a large commercial passenger
17160	19320	plane crashes.
19320	24460	Most of these are not hugely catastrophic, because most of these are fatality-free.
24460	31580	Of the 1,070 recorded crashes in the 2010s decade, only 112 proved fatal.
31580	36740	Even of these, the vast majority of passengers survive an average fatal crash.
36740	42940	In fact, half of all deaths from airline crashes in the previous decade are from just 12 incidents.
42940	49140	That's to say, most fatal aircraft accidents are not the kinds you see in movies—the
49140	52660	kinds where there are few or no survivors.
52660	58760	Most are more minor incidents, with just one or two or a few more unlucky victims.
58760	61940	The industry, though, does not view them that way.
61940	66600	The truth is that people fear airplanes an irrational amount, so in order for air travel
66600	72140	to be as commonplace as it is, they require a standard of safety far higher than any other
72140	74340	method of transport.
74340	78260	Safety and profitability go hand in hand for airlines.
78260	84380	Despite this, though, accidents are effectively an inevitability for any of the largest airlines.
84380	89940	Statistically, some of these largest airlines are also some of the safest, yet none are
89940	91860	100% safe.
91860	96220	Therefore, with enough flying, an accident will happen.
96220	100680	All ten of the world's largest airlines have had fatal accidents in their histories
100680	105700	and so, with this level of inevitability, airlines must have a strictly defined plan
105700	109140	for what to do after one of their airplanes crash.
109140	113220	So, let's say an accident happens.
113220	117380	This will almost certainly have something to do with landing or taking off.
117380	122640	The overwhelming majority of accidents involve the runway, however, if an accident is fatal,
122640	126940	it is much more likely that it has to do with a loss of control in flight or a controlled
126940	128800	crash into terrain.
128800	134860	Runway accidents represent more than 90% of accidents, but only account for 25% of fatal
134860	135860	accidents.
135860	140540	The airline really never is the first responder to an accident.
140540	145660	That is typically firefighters and other emergency personnel, but as soon as word of an accident
145660	149700	reaches them, the airline will begin to mobilize.
149700	153580	Almost every airline out there will have what's called a go team.
153580	157420	This is a group of people, typically working at the airline's headquarters, who train
157420	161940	to be part of the crisis response function on top of their ordinary jobs.
162020	166300	With larger airlines, this go team can be comprised of as many as hundreds of individuals
166300	169220	filling a huge variety of functions.
169220	173060	Larger long-haul airlines might also have smaller teams comprised of people working
173060	177060	at their outstations who can more quickly get to crash sites while the main team travels
177060	178540	from a headquarters.
178540	183180	Now, each airline will have different procedures and protocols, but there are loose standards
183180	184820	adopted by all.
184820	188680	Typically within three to four hours of a crash, an airline's go team will have assembled
188680	191180	and taken off from the headquarters airport.
191220	196460	Usually, a standby flight crew and aircraft would be used for this dedicated flight.
196460	199220	With them, they'd bring a go kit.
199220	203060	Considering accidents can happen quite literally anywhere, this would include all sorts of
203060	207900	things like satellite communications equipment, food, water, cooking equipment, personal protective
207900	211700	equipment, warm clothing, tents, generators, tools, and more.
211700	216340	The team's personnel are typically split up into dealing with three main areas—crisis
216340	219800	support, humanitarian support, and communications.
219800	223520	Each of these would likely be split up into a forward team and rear team.
223520	227980	If the crash occurs in a remote location, for example, the forward team, including the
227980	232320	most essential members of each of the larger teams, would likely go to the crash site and
232320	236120	set up a literal base camp using the equipment in the go kit.
236120	241400	Meanwhile, the rear team might set up in the nearest town with accommodations and facilities.
241400	247320	At the crash site, a triage area is set up away and upwind from the aircraft wreckage.
247320	252480	This might be done by some of the crisis response go team members or by emergency personnel.
252480	258560	There, individuals would be split up into three groups—deceased, injured, and uninjured.
258560	262660	The deceased and injured would typically be cared for by firefighters, medics, and other
262660	267040	emergency personnel whereas the airline go team would likely deal with the uninjured
267040	268100	passengers.
268100	272640	The rear go team will have, meanwhile, set up a survivor reception center, usually at
272640	276360	a nearby hotel, and arrange transportation to that site.
276400	280600	The largest group in the go team is typically the humanitarian assistance team which is
280600	285400	made up of volunteers among the airline's customer service staff—flight attendants,
285400	286900	airport agents, and others.
286900	290760	By grouping the passengers together in one facility, the airline separates them from
290760	295660	media and centralizes them for investigatory interviews and support functions.
295660	299840	The aircraft's surviving crew will typically be dealt with by a different team which would
299840	303520	bring them to a different facility than the passengers, which is recommended for both
303520	306240	legal and public relations reasons.
306540	310260	Another subset of the humanitarian assistance team will set up a facility for friends and
310260	313380	family of the passengers near the accident site.
313380	317720	They might also set up a separate facility at the origin or destination of the flight,
317720	320480	where large clusters of friends and family might be.
320480	324200	The individuals there would be provided with updates as a group, and then would be sorted
324200	328240	so that friends and families of survivors would be brought to an area to reunite, whereas
328240	332380	others might be broke in the news that their family member or friend has died.
332380	336600	The role of these family assistance centers is amplified in the case of crashes where
336600	341080	there is a significant long-term search and rescue operation, as is often the case with
341080	342340	crashes into the ocean.
342340	347140	In the case of the Malaysian Airlines Flight 370 disappearance, for example, the family
347140	351040	assistance centers were in operation for two months.
351040	355100	The passenger and family assistance centers might need to house hundreds and thousands
355100	359660	of individuals respectively, so the setup and functions of these is likely defined prior
359660	361700	to any accident.
361700	366260	Airlines will decide, for example, that they need a general lounge, a faith area, a psychological
366260	371700	assistance area, a press area, a phone and internet area, and more and more beforehand,
371700	375340	and then it's just about deciding which area goes where once a location for the facility
375340	377000	is identified.
377000	381480	With this and all other response efforts, actions are proceduralized so that each member
381480	386140	of the team knows what to do even in a fast-moving, chaotic scenario.
386140	390860	Away from the crash site, airlines will set up a crisis command center in their headquarters,
390860	394820	including executives from each aspect of the airline's operations in order to coordinate
394820	395820	their response.
395820	400380	In addition, a call center is often quickly set up and staffed to answer questions from
400380	403260	family and friends of passengers and the media.
403260	407900	This is just a small part of the overall communications efforts, though, because more than anything
407900	413300	else, probably the best thing an airline can do for themselves after an accident is communicate.
413300	419380	That's why the third primary aspect of a GO team, beyond crisis and humanitarian response,
419380	421420	is communications.
421420	426420	After one of their aircraft crash, an airline is concerned with business continuity—they're
426420	430360	concerned with how they'll emerge from the other end of the incident—and so their communications
430360	432980	have to be strategic.
432980	437520	Crisis communications is a subset of public relations intended to minimize reputational
437520	440700	damage after an incident at a company.
440700	445580	Within this, airlines want to be sure that, to the extent possible, they are able to control
445580	446960	the narrative.
446960	452200	That means they need to communicate fast and loudly to drown out any other noise.
452200	457360	So, they put communications GO team members on-site to be able to disseminate accurate
457360	462560	information as fast as possible to the media, survivors, and family and friends.
462560	467080	There will also, however, be a team back at the airline HQ that will have to make more
467080	470240	methodical, strategic communications decisions.
470240	475280	Now, at the end of the day, there ends up being two main options for responding to an
475280	479160	incident—accepting blame or deferring blame.
479160	483180	Academic research into the matter shows that taking responsibility early typically leads
483180	487200	to a better public response and actually tends to decrease the size of settlements that end
487200	492900	up getting paid out, however, the risk one runs is that, by accepting responsibility,
492900	495720	this can open up a company to legal consequences.
495720	501160	Therefore, despite overwhelming evidence that it is not the prudent move, organizations
501160	506360	will often defer responsibility until it is absolutely certain that it is indeed their
506360	507420	fault.
507420	511700	If it is absolutely sure that an accident is not the airline's fault, such as in the
511700	516620	case of aircraft manufacturing defects, deferring blame can actually shift public sentiment
516620	520980	to position the airline as a victim themselves, but the evidence for such cases typically
520980	526280	only becomes conclusive after years of investigation, so in the immediate aftermath of a crash it
526280	529000	can seem to the public as evading responsibility.
529000	535860	Therefore, deciding whether to take or shift blame is quite the tough choice for airlines.
535860	541720	One of the recent case studies in crisis communication involved Southwest Airlines Flight 1308 in
541720	542720	2018.
542720	547600	Shortly upon reaching cruise after its departure from LaGuardia airport, its left engine failed
547600	550840	and fragments were flung into the aircraft fuselage.
550840	555640	With that, one window was broken and, due to the rapid decompression and fast-moving
555640	559780	debris, the passenger sitting next to that window died from her injuries.
559780	564000	The aircraft ended up landing safely, and there were only minor injuries among the other
564000	567780	passengers, but for Southwest this was a major crisis.
567780	574160	It was the first aircraft accident fatality in the US since 2009, and their first ever.
574160	579160	Southwest essentially took responsibility right away—giving each passenger $5,000
579160	581920	in cash and $1,000 in flight credits.
582300	586760	They also, very quickly, issued empathetic, personable statements which, combined with
586760	591360	their prior positive reputation, were effective in persuading the public that they were truly
591360	592440	sorry.
592440	596320	The company also paused all marketing for a month to let the sensitive situation fade
596320	602160	away in public discourse, so, all told, this incident and its response cost them about
602160	604500	$100 million.
604500	609040	In the end, after the investigation was fully completed, it was determined that it probably
609040	611000	wasn't Southwest's fault.
611000	616320	The accident was caused by a tiny, largely invisible fatigue fracture on one of the engine's
616320	617320	fan blades.
617320	621300	Southwest followed all maintenance and inspection protocols for this aircraft, but for some
621300	623800	reason these didn't catch the issue.
623800	627440	Therefore, the protocols were updated after the fact.
627440	632140	Southwest went for the expensive, yet effective crisis communication method.
632140	636360	If they had deferred blame, they might have been able to lose less money, but if in the
636360	641400	end it was found that they should bear some blame, this could result in significant reputational
641400	642680	damage.
642680	647200	In the immediate response to a plane crash, the incentives of the airline and victims
647200	652820	are often aligned because the public responds positively to positive treatment of the victims.
652820	658880	It is later on, though, where incentives increasingly split—victims often look for compensation,
658880	661600	airlines look to minimize their financial responsibility.
661600	666240	By that time, the public is no longer interested in a plane crash.
666240	670680	Crashes are interesting when there's a burning pile of debris, not when a bunch of lawyers
670680	672400	are sitting in a courtroom.
672400	677680	Therefore, that's exactly why airlines put a huge, disproportionate amount of planning,
677680	681560	money, and effort into the phase of response with the burning pile of debris.
681560	687480	It's the most effective use of those resources and, at the end of the day, to airlines, airplane
687480	692300	crashes are a financial problem.
692300	696900	If you're anything like me, you listen to music, podcasts, and audiobooks constantly
696900	698140	while working.
698140	702240	That means that you probably have earbuds in for many hours per day, so it's worth
702240	705200	making sure the ones you use are good.
705200	710420	Having now tried them, I can attest that Raycon's wireless earbuds are good—they have great
710420	714300	audio quality and are super comfortable, yet they also stayed in perfectly while I was
714300	716680	out on a run, which was impressive.
716680	721980	Their everyday E25s have six hours of playtime, seamless Bluetooth pairing, a compact noise
721980	726540	isolating fit, and, most impressively, they cost about half as much as comparable premium
726540	727960	wireless earbuds.
727960	731820	On top of that, they're an even better deal considering they're giving Wendover viewers
