00:11.360 --> 00:17.160
Just about once every three days, somewhere in the world, a large commercial passenger

00:17.160 --> 00:19.320
plane crashes.

00:19.320 --> 00:24.460
Most of these are not hugely catastrophic, because most of these are fatality-free.

00:24.460 --> 00:31.580
Of the 1,070 recorded crashes in the 2010s decade, only 112 proved fatal.

00:31.580 --> 00:36.740
Even of these, the vast majority of passengers survive an average fatal crash.

00:36.740 --> 00:42.940
In fact, half of all deaths from airline crashes in the previous decade are from just 12 incidents.

00:42.940 --> 00:49.140
That's to say, most fatal aircraft accidents are not the kinds you see in movies—the

00:49.140 --> 00:52.660
kinds where there are few or no survivors.

00:52.660 --> 00:58.760
Most are more minor incidents, with just one or two or a few more unlucky victims.

00:58.760 --> 01:01.940
The industry, though, does not view them that way.

01:01.940 --> 01:06.600
The truth is that people fear airplanes an irrational amount, so in order for air travel

01:06.600 --> 01:12.140
to be as commonplace as it is, they require a standard of safety far higher than any other

01:12.140 --> 01:14.340
method of transport.

01:14.340 --> 01:18.260
Safety and profitability go hand in hand for airlines.

01:18.260 --> 01:24.380
Despite this, though, accidents are effectively an inevitability for any of the largest airlines.

01:24.380 --> 01:29.940
Statistically, some of these largest airlines are also some of the safest, yet none are

01:29.940 --> 01:31.860
100% safe.

01:31.860 --> 01:36.220
Therefore, with enough flying, an accident will happen.

01:36.220 --> 01:40.680
All ten of the world's largest airlines have had fatal accidents in their histories

01:40.680 --> 01:45.700
and so, with this level of inevitability, airlines must have a strictly defined plan

01:45.700 --> 01:49.140
for what to do after one of their airplanes crash.

01:49.140 --> 01:53.220
So, let's say an accident happens.

01:53.220 --> 01:57.380
This will almost certainly have something to do with landing or taking off.

01:57.380 --> 02:02.640
The overwhelming majority of accidents involve the runway, however, if an accident is fatal,

02:02.640 --> 02:06.940
it is much more likely that it has to do with a loss of control in flight or a controlled

02:06.940 --> 02:08.800
crash into terrain.

02:08.800 --> 02:14.860
Runway accidents represent more than 90% of accidents, but only account for 25% of fatal

02:14.860 --> 02:15.860
accidents.

02:15.860 --> 02:20.540
The airline really never is the first responder to an accident.

02:20.540 --> 02:25.660
That is typically firefighters and other emergency personnel, but as soon as word of an accident

02:25.660 --> 02:29.700
reaches them, the airline will begin to mobilize.

02:29.700 --> 02:33.580
Almost every airline out there will have what's called a go team.

02:33.580 --> 02:37.420
This is a group of people, typically working at the airline's headquarters, who train

02:37.420 --> 02:41.940
to be part of the crisis response function on top of their ordinary jobs.

02:42.020 --> 02:46.300
With larger airlines, this go team can be comprised of as many as hundreds of individuals

02:46.300 --> 02:49.220
filling a huge variety of functions.

02:49.220 --> 02:53.060
Larger long-haul airlines might also have smaller teams comprised of people working

02:53.060 --> 02:57.060
at their outstations who can more quickly get to crash sites while the main team travels

02:57.060 --> 02:58.540
from a headquarters.

02:58.540 --> 03:03.180
Now, each airline will have different procedures and protocols, but there are loose standards

03:03.180 --> 03:04.820
adopted by all.

03:04.820 --> 03:08.680
Typically within three to four hours of a crash, an airline's go team will have assembled

03:08.680 --> 03:11.180
and taken off from the headquarters airport.

03:11.220 --> 03:16.460
Usually, a standby flight crew and aircraft would be used for this dedicated flight.

03:16.460 --> 03:19.220
With them, they'd bring a go kit.

03:19.220 --> 03:23.060
Considering accidents can happen quite literally anywhere, this would include all sorts of

03:23.060 --> 03:27.900
things like satellite communications equipment, food, water, cooking equipment, personal protective

03:27.900 --> 03:31.700
equipment, warm clothing, tents, generators, tools, and more.

03:31.700 --> 03:36.340
The team's personnel are typically split up into dealing with three main areas—crisis

03:36.340 --> 03:39.800
support, humanitarian support, and communications.

03:39.800 --> 03:43.520
Each of these would likely be split up into a forward team and rear team.

03:43.520 --> 03:47.980
If the crash occurs in a remote location, for example, the forward team, including the

03:47.980 --> 03:52.320
most essential members of each of the larger teams, would likely go to the crash site and

03:52.320 --> 03:56.120
set up a literal base camp using the equipment in the go kit.

03:56.120 --> 04:01.400
Meanwhile, the rear team might set up in the nearest town with accommodations and facilities.

04:01.400 --> 04:07.320
At the crash site, a triage area is set up away and upwind from the aircraft wreckage.

04:07.320 --> 04:12.480
This might be done by some of the crisis response go team members or by emergency personnel.

04:12.480 --> 04:18.560
There, individuals would be split up into three groups—deceased, injured, and uninjured.

04:18.560 --> 04:22.660
The deceased and injured would typically be cared for by firefighters, medics, and other

04:22.660 --> 04:27.040
emergency personnel whereas the airline go team would likely deal with the uninjured

04:27.040 --> 04:28.100
passengers.

04:28.100 --> 04:32.640
The rear go team will have, meanwhile, set up a survivor reception center, usually at

04:32.640 --> 04:36.360
a nearby hotel, and arrange transportation to that site.

04:36.400 --> 04:40.600
The largest group in the go team is typically the humanitarian assistance team which is

04:40.600 --> 04:45.400
made up of volunteers among the airline's customer service staff—flight attendants,

04:45.400 --> 04:46.900
airport agents, and others.

04:46.900 --> 04:50.760
By grouping the passengers together in one facility, the airline separates them from

04:50.760 --> 04:55.660
media and centralizes them for investigatory interviews and support functions.

04:55.660 --> 04:59.840
The aircraft's surviving crew will typically be dealt with by a different team which would

04:59.840 --> 05:03.520
bring them to a different facility than the passengers, which is recommended for both

05:03.520 --> 05:06.240
legal and public relations reasons.

05:06.540 --> 05:10.260
Another subset of the humanitarian assistance team will set up a facility for friends and

05:10.260 --> 05:13.380
family of the passengers near the accident site.

05:13.380 --> 05:17.720
They might also set up a separate facility at the origin or destination of the flight,

05:17.720 --> 05:20.480
where large clusters of friends and family might be.

05:20.480 --> 05:24.200
The individuals there would be provided with updates as a group, and then would be sorted

05:24.200 --> 05:28.240
so that friends and families of survivors would be brought to an area to reunite, whereas

05:28.240 --> 05:32.380
others might be broke in the news that their family member or friend has died.

05:32.380 --> 05:36.600
The role of these family assistance centers is amplified in the case of crashes where

05:36.600 --> 05:41.080
there is a significant long-term search and rescue operation, as is often the case with

05:41.080 --> 05:42.340
crashes into the ocean.

05:42.340 --> 05:47.140
In the case of the Malaysian Airlines Flight 370 disappearance, for example, the family

05:47.140 --> 05:51.040
assistance centers were in operation for two months.

05:51.040 --> 05:55.100
The passenger and family assistance centers might need to house hundreds and thousands

05:55.100 --> 05:59.660
of individuals respectively, so the setup and functions of these is likely defined prior

05:59.660 --> 06:01.700
to any accident.

06:01.700 --> 06:06.260
Airlines will decide, for example, that they need a general lounge, a faith area, a psychological

06:06.260 --> 06:11.700
assistance area, a press area, a phone and internet area, and more and more beforehand,

06:11.700 --> 06:15.340
and then it's just about deciding which area goes where once a location for the facility

06:15.340 --> 06:17.000
is identified.

06:17.000 --> 06:21.480
With this and all other response efforts, actions are proceduralized so that each member

06:21.480 --> 06:26.140
of the team knows what to do even in a fast-moving, chaotic scenario.

06:26.140 --> 06:30.860
Away from the crash site, airlines will set up a crisis command center in their headquarters,

06:30.860 --> 06:34.820
including executives from each aspect of the airline's operations in order to coordinate

06:34.820 --> 06:35.820
their response.

06:35.820 --> 06:40.380
In addition, a call center is often quickly set up and staffed to answer questions from

06:40.380 --> 06:43.260
family and friends of passengers and the media.

06:43.260 --> 06:47.900
This is just a small part of the overall communications efforts, though, because more than anything

06:47.900 --> 06:53.300
else, probably the best thing an airline can do for themselves after an accident is communicate.

06:53.300 --> 06:59.380
That's why the third primary aspect of a GO team, beyond crisis and humanitarian response,

06:59.380 --> 07:01.420
is communications.

07:01.420 --> 07:06.420
After one of their aircraft crash, an airline is concerned with business continuity—they're

07:06.420 --> 07:10.360
concerned with how they'll emerge from the other end of the incident—and so their communications

07:10.360 --> 07:12.980
have to be strategic.

07:12.980 --> 07:17.520
Crisis communications is a subset of public relations intended to minimize reputational

07:17.520 --> 07:20.700
damage after an incident at a company.

07:20.700 --> 07:25.580
Within this, airlines want to be sure that, to the extent possible, they are able to control

07:25.580 --> 07:26.960
the narrative.

07:26.960 --> 07:32.200
That means they need to communicate fast and loudly to drown out any other noise.

07:32.200 --> 07:37.360
So, they put communications GO team members on-site to be able to disseminate accurate

07:37.360 --> 07:42.560
information as fast as possible to the media, survivors, and family and friends.

07:42.560 --> 07:47.080
There will also, however, be a team back at the airline HQ that will have to make more

07:47.080 --> 07:50.240
methodical, strategic communications decisions.

07:50.240 --> 07:55.280
Now, at the end of the day, there ends up being two main options for responding to an

07:55.280 --> 07:59.160
incident—accepting blame or deferring blame.

07:59.160 --> 08:03.180
Academic research into the matter shows that taking responsibility early typically leads

08:03.180 --> 08:07.200
to a better public response and actually tends to decrease the size of settlements that end

08:07.200 --> 08:12.900
up getting paid out, however, the risk one runs is that, by accepting responsibility,

08:12.900 --> 08:15.720
this can open up a company to legal consequences.

08:15.720 --> 08:21.160
Therefore, despite overwhelming evidence that it is not the prudent move, organizations

08:21.160 --> 08:26.360
will often defer responsibility until it is absolutely certain that it is indeed their

08:26.360 --> 08:27.420
fault.

08:27.420 --> 08:31.700
If it is absolutely sure that an accident is not the airline's fault, such as in the

08:31.700 --> 08:36.620
case of aircraft manufacturing defects, deferring blame can actually shift public sentiment

08:36.620 --> 08:40.980
to position the airline as a victim themselves, but the evidence for such cases typically

08:40.980 --> 08:46.280
only becomes conclusive after years of investigation, so in the immediate aftermath of a crash it

08:46.280 --> 08:49.000
can seem to the public as evading responsibility.

08:49.000 --> 08:55.860
Therefore, deciding whether to take or shift blame is quite the tough choice for airlines.

08:55.860 --> 09:01.720
One of the recent case studies in crisis communication involved Southwest Airlines Flight 1308 in

09:01.720 --> 09:02.720
2018.

09:02.720 --> 09:07.600
Shortly upon reaching cruise after its departure from LaGuardia airport, its left engine failed

09:07.600 --> 09:10.840
and fragments were flung into the aircraft fuselage.

09:10.840 --> 09:15.640
With that, one window was broken and, due to the rapid decompression and fast-moving

09:15.640 --> 09:19.780
debris, the passenger sitting next to that window died from her injuries.

09:19.780 --> 09:24.000
The aircraft ended up landing safely, and there were only minor injuries among the other

09:24.000 --> 09:27.780
passengers, but for Southwest this was a major crisis.

09:27.780 --> 09:34.160
It was the first aircraft accident fatality in the US since 2009, and their first ever.

09:34.160 --> 09:39.160
Southwest essentially took responsibility right away—giving each passenger $5,000

09:39.160 --> 09:41.920
in cash and $1,000 in flight credits.

09:42.300 --> 09:46.760
They also, very quickly, issued empathetic, personable statements which, combined with

09:46.760 --> 09:51.360
their prior positive reputation, were effective in persuading the public that they were truly

09:51.360 --> 09:52.440
sorry.

09:52.440 --> 09:56.320
The company also paused all marketing for a month to let the sensitive situation fade

09:56.320 --> 10:02.160
away in public discourse, so, all told, this incident and its response cost them about

10:02.160 --> 10:04.500
$100 million.

10:04.500 --> 10:09.040
In the end, after the investigation was fully completed, it was determined that it probably

10:09.040 --> 10:11.000
wasn't Southwest's fault.

10:11.000 --> 10:16.320
The accident was caused by a tiny, largely invisible fatigue fracture on one of the engine's

10:16.320 --> 10:17.320
fan blades.

10:17.320 --> 10:21.300
Southwest followed all maintenance and inspection protocols for this aircraft, but for some

10:21.300 --> 10:23.800
reason these didn't catch the issue.

10:23.800 --> 10:27.440
Therefore, the protocols were updated after the fact.

10:27.440 --> 10:32.140
Southwest went for the expensive, yet effective crisis communication method.

10:32.140 --> 10:36.360
If they had deferred blame, they might have been able to lose less money, but if in the

10:36.360 --> 10:41.400
end it was found that they should bear some blame, this could result in significant reputational

10:41.400 --> 10:42.680
damage.

10:42.680 --> 10:47.200
In the immediate response to a plane crash, the incentives of the airline and victims

10:47.200 --> 10:52.820
are often aligned because the public responds positively to positive treatment of the victims.

10:52.820 --> 10:58.880
It is later on, though, where incentives increasingly split—victims often look for compensation,

10:58.880 --> 11:01.600
airlines look to minimize their financial responsibility.

11:01.600 --> 11:06.240
By that time, the public is no longer interested in a plane crash.

11:06.240 --> 11:10.680
Crashes are interesting when there's a burning pile of debris, not when a bunch of lawyers

11:10.680 --> 11:12.400
are sitting in a courtroom.

11:12.400 --> 11:17.680
Therefore, that's exactly why airlines put a huge, disproportionate amount of planning,

11:17.680 --> 11:21.560
money, and effort into the phase of response with the burning pile of debris.

11:21.560 --> 11:27.480
It's the most effective use of those resources and, at the end of the day, to airlines, airplane

11:27.480 --> 11:32.300
crashes are a financial problem.

11:32.300 --> 11:36.900
If you're anything like me, you listen to music, podcasts, and audiobooks constantly

11:36.900 --> 11:38.140
while working.

11:38.140 --> 11:42.240
That means that you probably have earbuds in for many hours per day, so it's worth

11:42.240 --> 11:45.200
making sure the ones you use are good.

11:45.200 --> 11:50.420
Having now tried them, I can attest that Raycon's wireless earbuds are good—they have great

11:50.420 --> 11:54.300
audio quality and are super comfortable, yet they also stayed in perfectly while I was

11:54.300 --> 11:56.680
out on a run, which was impressive.

11:56.680 --> 12:01.980
Their everyday E25s have six hours of playtime, seamless Bluetooth pairing, a compact noise

12:01.980 --> 12:06.540
isolating fit, and, most impressively, they cost about half as much as comparable premium

12:06.540 --> 12:07.960
wireless earbuds.

12:07.960 --> 12:11.820
On top of that, they're an even better deal considering they're giving Wendover viewers
