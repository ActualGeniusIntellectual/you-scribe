0	14600	Everyone likes to think that they're not affected by advertisements, but unless you've never
14600	19380	seen a single advertisement in your life, your choices are influenced and affected by
19380	22580	all the advertisements you've ever seen.
22580	26780	Every advertisement changes our opinion on the brand or product.
26780	30520	You may see some advertisements where you think, why would anyone decide to buy this
30520	32400	product after seeing this?
32400	36820	But the purpose of advertisements is no longer to have the consumer immediately pick up the
36820	38660	phone and buy the product.
38660	43160	The purpose of these advertisements is not to inform the consumer about the product and
43160	44480	its features.
44480	49460	The reason companies like McDonald's, who have an almost universal recognition, still
49460	54560	advertise is because they are trying to build an opinion and corresponding brand image in
54560	58400	their consumers' minds.
58400	64060	There are two main psychological methods that marketers use nowadays for their advertisements.
64060	67560	The first method is called the mere exposure method.
67560	72780	These are those minimalist, bare bones advertisements that make you scratch your head and wonder
72780	76060	why the company would spend thousands of dollars on them.
76060	79260	It's because everyone is more comfortable in groups.
79260	83660	If one line at the bank is considerably longer than the other, people will almost always
83660	87680	go to the longer line because they think that there must be a reason that people choose
87680	89960	one line over the other.
89960	94520	They think that one line is better than the other or that one line is more correct than
94520	95520	the other.
95520	98440	It's just an easier and more comfortable decision.
98440	102640	It's the same kind of idea in consumer psychology.
102640	107920	By exposing the consumer to the brand, the consumer starts to feel like they know it.
107920	111800	Because of this, when the consumer goes to the store to buy detergent, they can reach
111800	114740	for Tide and be comfortable in this decision.
114740	118820	The Tide detergent might be a couple dollars more than the store brand detergent, but they
118820	122400	know that this brand detergent will work well.
122400	127980	It wouldn't be such a huge brand if it didn't work so well.
127980	133220	A greater example of this phenomenon is with painkillers and other over-the-counter drugs
133220	134920	at the pharmacy.
134920	139580	The generic brand drugs are the exact same product as the name brand with the exact same
139580	142040	composition of ingredients.
142040	146320	If they had a different composition of ingredients, they would not be allowed to be called the
146320	147320	same drug.
147320	154800	Advil and generic brand ibuprofen are the exact same product with the exact same composition,
154800	159480	but still people will buy the Advil despite its deeper price.
159480	162900	It's just easier to choose what everyone else chooses.
162900	170260	The consumer tends to be anxious to buy the cheaper, generic brand drug.
170260	173120	Does this mean you should always buy the generic brand drugs?
173120	174960	Well, not necessarily.
174960	179800	In a study by the University of Cincinnati, Parkinson's disease patients were given two
179800	185580	drugs, one in which they were told was a more expensive name brand drug, the other being
185580	188520	a less expensive off-brand drug.
188520	193700	After taking the supposedly more expensive drug, the patients had a 28% greater increase
193700	198260	in motor skills than after having taken the supposedly cheaper drug.
198260	203500	Well, in reality, both the injections were just saline solution.
203500	208380	The expectations were higher for the name brand drug, therefore the patients felt better
208380	210660	because of a placebo effect.
210660	216580	So sometimes spending more will make you feel better.
216600	222240	The other common psychological method used in marketing is the classic conditioning method.
222240	227960	The idea behind this technique came from a study done by Russian physiologist Ivan Pavlov
227960	229760	in the 1890s.
229760	234240	Pavlov noticed that his dogs would start to salivate whenever he would enter the room
234240	236400	even if he didn't have food.
236400	241080	This was because the dogs had an expectation that they would receive food when Pavlov came
241080	246620	into the room because every time he did have food, he would walk into the room.
246620	252300	Pavlov decided to start ringing a bell whenever he gave food to his dogs and after a while,
252300	256900	the dogs would, whenever they heard the sound of a bell, start salivating.
256900	261060	This is because the dogs were trained to associate the sound of the bell with food coming.
261060	267060	They were trained to have the expectation of food.
267060	270780	The same psychological principle works with humans.
270780	274960	Humans will try to have certain feelings, reactions, or images associated with their
274960	276340	product.
276340	280840	If in their advertisements they show certain images in conjunction with their product,
280840	285040	the consumer will subconsciously relate the images to the product.
285040	287720	The best part of this technique is that it always works.
287720	292520	No matter how much you try to block out the advertisements, as long as you see them, you
292520	297500	will start to subconsciously relate the two images.
297500	301440	Car brands are the biggest culprit of using this sneaky technique.
301440	305640	Their advertisements rarely have anything to do with the actual car, but rather about
305640	307760	someone driving a car.
307760	312760	Luxury car brands will show people in black tie pulling up to a red carpet event, while
312760	318080	SUV advertisements will show some adventurous looking couple with kayaks and bikes in tow
318080	320600	driving on some dirt road.
320600	324680	At this point, you're barely buying a car, but rather a lifestyle.
324680	329460	You're buying into the image of being someone that goes to black tie events, or spends their
329460	331560	weekends being adventurous.
331560	339000	The car barely matters at that point, it's the image that you're buying.
339000	344940	Perhaps the greatest advertising success in recent memory is the Beats headphones brand.
344940	351860	Beats controls 27% of the $1.8 billion headphone market, despite making what are generally
351860	355300	agreed upon to be mediocre sounding headphones.
355300	360120	The New York Times reported that the actual manufacturing cost of these headphones, which
360120	366040	sell for upwards of $250, is about $14.
366040	370340	The reason Beats are considered such a premium product is because of their marketing and
370340	372060	brand image.
372060	377580	From the beginning, Beats spent a huge amount of money to pay for celebrity sponsorships.
377580	381580	All the most famous athletes were wearing Beats in their interviews, so the consumer
381580	386360	started to get the idea that these were fashionable, high priced headphones.
386360	392980	The high priced, solid heavy materials, sturdy packaging, and celebrity endorsements all
392980	398340	raised people's expectations, and likely psychologically made the headphones sound
398340	401100	better, just like with the name brand medicines.
