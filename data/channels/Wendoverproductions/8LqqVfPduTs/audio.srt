1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:14,600
Everyone likes to think that they're not affected by advertisements, but unless you've never

2
00:00:14,600 --> 00:00:19,380
seen a single advertisement in your life, your choices are influenced and affected by

3
00:00:19,380 --> 00:00:22,580
all the advertisements you've ever seen.

4
00:00:22,580 --> 00:00:26,780
Every advertisement changes our opinion on the brand or product.

5
00:00:26,780 --> 00:00:30,520
You may see some advertisements where you think, why would anyone decide to buy this

6
00:00:30,520 --> 00:00:32,400
product after seeing this?

7
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:36,820
But the purpose of advertisements is no longer to have the consumer immediately pick up the

8
00:00:36,820 --> 00:00:38,660
phone and buy the product.

9
00:00:38,660 --> 00:00:43,160
The purpose of these advertisements is not to inform the consumer about the product and

10
00:00:43,160 --> 00:00:44,480
its features.

11
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:49,460
The reason companies like McDonald's, who have an almost universal recognition, still

12
00:00:49,460 --> 00:00:54,560
advertise is because they are trying to build an opinion and corresponding brand image in

13
00:00:54,560 --> 00:00:58,400
their consumers' minds.

14
00:00:58,400 --> 00:01:04,060
There are two main psychological methods that marketers use nowadays for their advertisements.

15
00:01:04,060 --> 00:01:07,560
The first method is called the mere exposure method.

16
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:12,780
These are those minimalist, bare bones advertisements that make you scratch your head and wonder

17
00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:16,060
why the company would spend thousands of dollars on them.

18
00:01:16,060 --> 00:01:19,260
It's because everyone is more comfortable in groups.

19
00:01:19,260 --> 00:01:23,660
If one line at the bank is considerably longer than the other, people will almost always

20
00:01:23,660 --> 00:01:27,680
go to the longer line because they think that there must be a reason that people choose

21
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:29,960
one line over the other.

22
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:34,520
They think that one line is better than the other or that one line is more correct than

23
00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:35,520
the other.

24
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:38,440
It's just an easier and more comfortable decision.

25
00:01:38,440 --> 00:01:42,640
It's the same kind of idea in consumer psychology.

26
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:47,920
By exposing the consumer to the brand, the consumer starts to feel like they know it.

27
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:51,800
Because of this, when the consumer goes to the store to buy detergent, they can reach

28
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:54,740
for Tide and be comfortable in this decision.

29
00:01:54,740 --> 00:01:58,820
The Tide detergent might be a couple dollars more than the store brand detergent, but they

30
00:01:58,820 --> 00:02:02,400
know that this brand detergent will work well.

31
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:07,980
It wouldn't be such a huge brand if it didn't work so well.

32
00:02:07,980 --> 00:02:13,220
A greater example of this phenomenon is with painkillers and other over-the-counter drugs

33
00:02:13,220 --> 00:02:14,920
at the pharmacy.

34
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:19,580
The generic brand drugs are the exact same product as the name brand with the exact same

35
00:02:19,580 --> 00:02:22,040
composition of ingredients.

36
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:26,320
If they had a different composition of ingredients, they would not be allowed to be called the

37
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:27,320
same drug.

38
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:34,800
Advil and generic brand ibuprofen are the exact same product with the exact same composition,

39
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:39,480
but still people will buy the Advil despite its deeper price.

40
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:42,900
It's just easier to choose what everyone else chooses.

41
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:50,260
The consumer tends to be anxious to buy the cheaper, generic brand drug.

42
00:02:50,260 --> 00:02:53,120
Does this mean you should always buy the generic brand drugs?

43
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:54,960
Well, not necessarily.

44
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:59,800
In a study by the University of Cincinnati, Parkinson's disease patients were given two

45
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:05,580
drugs, one in which they were told was a more expensive name brand drug, the other being

46
00:03:05,580 --> 00:03:08,520
a less expensive off-brand drug.

47
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:13,700
After taking the supposedly more expensive drug, the patients had a 28% greater increase

48
00:03:13,700 --> 00:03:18,260
in motor skills than after having taken the supposedly cheaper drug.

49
00:03:18,260 --> 00:03:23,500
Well, in reality, both the injections were just saline solution.

50
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:28,380
The expectations were higher for the name brand drug, therefore the patients felt better

51
00:03:28,380 --> 00:03:30,660
because of a placebo effect.

52
00:03:30,660 --> 00:03:36,580
So sometimes spending more will make you feel better.

53
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:42,240
The other common psychological method used in marketing is the classic conditioning method.

54
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:47,960
The idea behind this technique came from a study done by Russian physiologist Ivan Pavlov

55
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:49,760
in the 1890s.

56
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:54,240
Pavlov noticed that his dogs would start to salivate whenever he would enter the room

57
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:56,400
even if he didn't have food.

58
00:03:56,400 --> 00:04:01,080
This was because the dogs had an expectation that they would receive food when Pavlov came

59
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:06,620
into the room because every time he did have food, he would walk into the room.

60
00:04:06,620 --> 00:04:12,300
Pavlov decided to start ringing a bell whenever he gave food to his dogs and after a while,

61
00:04:12,300 --> 00:04:16,900
the dogs would, whenever they heard the sound of a bell, start salivating.

62
00:04:16,900 --> 00:04:21,060
This is because the dogs were trained to associate the sound of the bell with food coming.

63
00:04:21,060 --> 00:04:27,060
They were trained to have the expectation of food.

64
00:04:27,060 --> 00:04:30,780
The same psychological principle works with humans.

65
00:04:30,780 --> 00:04:34,960
Humans will try to have certain feelings, reactions, or images associated with their

66
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:36,340
product.

67
00:04:36,340 --> 00:04:40,840
If in their advertisements they show certain images in conjunction with their product,

68
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:45,040
the consumer will subconsciously relate the images to the product.

69
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:47,720
The best part of this technique is that it always works.

70
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:52,520
No matter how much you try to block out the advertisements, as long as you see them, you

71
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:57,500
will start to subconsciously relate the two images.

72
00:04:57,500 --> 00:05:01,440
Car brands are the biggest culprit of using this sneaky technique.

73
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:05,640
Their advertisements rarely have anything to do with the actual car, but rather about

74
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:07,760
someone driving a car.

75
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:12,760
Luxury car brands will show people in black tie pulling up to a red carpet event, while

76
00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:18,080
SUV advertisements will show some adventurous looking couple with kayaks and bikes in tow

77
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:20,600
driving on some dirt road.

78
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:24,680
At this point, you're barely buying a car, but rather a lifestyle.

79
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:29,460
You're buying into the image of being someone that goes to black tie events, or spends their

80
00:05:29,460 --> 00:05:31,560
weekends being adventurous.

81
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:39,000
The car barely matters at that point, it's the image that you're buying.

82
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:44,940
Perhaps the greatest advertising success in recent memory is the Beats headphones brand.

83
00:05:44,940 --> 00:05:51,860
Beats controls 27% of the $1.8 billion headphone market, despite making what are generally

84
00:05:51,860 --> 00:05:55,300
agreed upon to be mediocre sounding headphones.

85
00:05:55,300 --> 00:06:00,120
The New York Times reported that the actual manufacturing cost of these headphones, which

86
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:06,040
sell for upwards of $250, is about $14.

87
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:10,340
The reason Beats are considered such a premium product is because of their marketing and

88
00:06:10,340 --> 00:06:12,060
brand image.

89
00:06:12,060 --> 00:06:17,580
From the beginning, Beats spent a huge amount of money to pay for celebrity sponsorships.

90
00:06:17,580 --> 00:06:21,580
All the most famous athletes were wearing Beats in their interviews, so the consumer

91
00:06:21,580 --> 00:06:26,360
started to get the idea that these were fashionable, high priced headphones.

92
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:32,980
The high priced, solid heavy materials, sturdy packaging, and celebrity endorsements all

93
00:06:32,980 --> 00:06:38,340
raised people's expectations, and likely psychologically made the headphones sound

94
00:06:38,340 --> 00:06:41,100
better, just like with the name brand medicines.
