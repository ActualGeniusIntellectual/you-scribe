00:00.000 --> 00:14.600
Everyone likes to think that they're not affected by advertisements, but unless you've never

00:14.600 --> 00:19.380
seen a single advertisement in your life, your choices are influenced and affected by

00:19.380 --> 00:22.580
all the advertisements you've ever seen.

00:22.580 --> 00:26.780
Every advertisement changes our opinion on the brand or product.

00:26.780 --> 00:30.520
You may see some advertisements where you think, why would anyone decide to buy this

00:30.520 --> 00:32.400
product after seeing this?

00:32.400 --> 00:36.820
But the purpose of advertisements is no longer to have the consumer immediately pick up the

00:36.820 --> 00:38.660
phone and buy the product.

00:38.660 --> 00:43.160
The purpose of these advertisements is not to inform the consumer about the product and

00:43.160 --> 00:44.480
its features.

00:44.480 --> 00:49.460
The reason companies like McDonald's, who have an almost universal recognition, still

00:49.460 --> 00:54.560
advertise is because they are trying to build an opinion and corresponding brand image in

00:54.560 --> 00:58.400
their consumers' minds.

00:58.400 --> 01:04.060
There are two main psychological methods that marketers use nowadays for their advertisements.

01:04.060 --> 01:07.560
The first method is called the mere exposure method.

01:07.560 --> 01:12.780
These are those minimalist, bare bones advertisements that make you scratch your head and wonder

01:12.780 --> 01:16.060
why the company would spend thousands of dollars on them.

01:16.060 --> 01:19.260
It's because everyone is more comfortable in groups.

01:19.260 --> 01:23.660
If one line at the bank is considerably longer than the other, people will almost always

01:23.660 --> 01:27.680
go to the longer line because they think that there must be a reason that people choose

01:27.680 --> 01:29.960
one line over the other.

01:29.960 --> 01:34.520
They think that one line is better than the other or that one line is more correct than

01:34.520 --> 01:35.520
the other.

01:35.520 --> 01:38.440
It's just an easier and more comfortable decision.

01:38.440 --> 01:42.640
It's the same kind of idea in consumer psychology.

01:42.640 --> 01:47.920
By exposing the consumer to the brand, the consumer starts to feel like they know it.

01:47.920 --> 01:51.800
Because of this, when the consumer goes to the store to buy detergent, they can reach

01:51.800 --> 01:54.740
for Tide and be comfortable in this decision.

01:54.740 --> 01:58.820
The Tide detergent might be a couple dollars more than the store brand detergent, but they

01:58.820 --> 02:02.400
know that this brand detergent will work well.

02:02.400 --> 02:07.980
It wouldn't be such a huge brand if it didn't work so well.

02:07.980 --> 02:13.220
A greater example of this phenomenon is with painkillers and other over-the-counter drugs

02:13.220 --> 02:14.920
at the pharmacy.

02:14.920 --> 02:19.580
The generic brand drugs are the exact same product as the name brand with the exact same

02:19.580 --> 02:22.040
composition of ingredients.

02:22.040 --> 02:26.320
If they had a different composition of ingredients, they would not be allowed to be called the

02:26.320 --> 02:27.320
same drug.

02:27.320 --> 02:34.800
Advil and generic brand ibuprofen are the exact same product with the exact same composition,

02:34.800 --> 02:39.480
but still people will buy the Advil despite its deeper price.

02:39.480 --> 02:42.900
It's just easier to choose what everyone else chooses.

02:42.900 --> 02:50.260
The consumer tends to be anxious to buy the cheaper, generic brand drug.

02:50.260 --> 02:53.120
Does this mean you should always buy the generic brand drugs?

02:53.120 --> 02:54.960
Well, not necessarily.

02:54.960 --> 02:59.800
In a study by the University of Cincinnati, Parkinson's disease patients were given two

02:59.800 --> 03:05.580
drugs, one in which they were told was a more expensive name brand drug, the other being

03:05.580 --> 03:08.520
a less expensive off-brand drug.

03:08.520 --> 03:13.700
After taking the supposedly more expensive drug, the patients had a 28% greater increase

03:13.700 --> 03:18.260
in motor skills than after having taken the supposedly cheaper drug.

03:18.260 --> 03:23.500
Well, in reality, both the injections were just saline solution.

03:23.500 --> 03:28.380
The expectations were higher for the name brand drug, therefore the patients felt better

03:28.380 --> 03:30.660
because of a placebo effect.

03:30.660 --> 03:36.580
So sometimes spending more will make you feel better.

03:36.600 --> 03:42.240
The other common psychological method used in marketing is the classic conditioning method.

03:42.240 --> 03:47.960
The idea behind this technique came from a study done by Russian physiologist Ivan Pavlov

03:47.960 --> 03:49.760
in the 1890s.

03:49.760 --> 03:54.240
Pavlov noticed that his dogs would start to salivate whenever he would enter the room

03:54.240 --> 03:56.400
even if he didn't have food.

03:56.400 --> 04:01.080
This was because the dogs had an expectation that they would receive food when Pavlov came

04:01.080 --> 04:06.620
into the room because every time he did have food, he would walk into the room.

04:06.620 --> 04:12.300
Pavlov decided to start ringing a bell whenever he gave food to his dogs and after a while,

04:12.300 --> 04:16.900
the dogs would, whenever they heard the sound of a bell, start salivating.

04:16.900 --> 04:21.060
This is because the dogs were trained to associate the sound of the bell with food coming.

04:21.060 --> 04:27.060
They were trained to have the expectation of food.

04:27.060 --> 04:30.780
The same psychological principle works with humans.

04:30.780 --> 04:34.960
Humans will try to have certain feelings, reactions, or images associated with their

04:34.960 --> 04:36.340
product.

04:36.340 --> 04:40.840
If in their advertisements they show certain images in conjunction with their product,

04:40.840 --> 04:45.040
the consumer will subconsciously relate the images to the product.

04:45.040 --> 04:47.720
The best part of this technique is that it always works.

04:47.720 --> 04:52.520
No matter how much you try to block out the advertisements, as long as you see them, you

04:52.520 --> 04:57.500
will start to subconsciously relate the two images.

04:57.500 --> 05:01.440
Car brands are the biggest culprit of using this sneaky technique.

05:01.440 --> 05:05.640
Their advertisements rarely have anything to do with the actual car, but rather about

05:05.640 --> 05:07.760
someone driving a car.

05:07.760 --> 05:12.760
Luxury car brands will show people in black tie pulling up to a red carpet event, while

05:12.760 --> 05:18.080
SUV advertisements will show some adventurous looking couple with kayaks and bikes in tow

05:18.080 --> 05:20.600
driving on some dirt road.

05:20.600 --> 05:24.680
At this point, you're barely buying a car, but rather a lifestyle.

05:24.680 --> 05:29.460
You're buying into the image of being someone that goes to black tie events, or spends their

05:29.460 --> 05:31.560
weekends being adventurous.

05:31.560 --> 05:39.000
The car barely matters at that point, it's the image that you're buying.

05:39.000 --> 05:44.940
Perhaps the greatest advertising success in recent memory is the Beats headphones brand.

05:44.940 --> 05:51.860
Beats controls 27% of the $1.8 billion headphone market, despite making what are generally

05:51.860 --> 05:55.300
agreed upon to be mediocre sounding headphones.

05:55.300 --> 06:00.120
The New York Times reported that the actual manufacturing cost of these headphones, which

06:00.120 --> 06:06.040
sell for upwards of $250, is about $14.

06:06.040 --> 06:10.340
The reason Beats are considered such a premium product is because of their marketing and

06:10.340 --> 06:12.060
brand image.

06:12.060 --> 06:17.580
From the beginning, Beats spent a huge amount of money to pay for celebrity sponsorships.

06:17.580 --> 06:21.580
All the most famous athletes were wearing Beats in their interviews, so the consumer

06:21.580 --> 06:26.360
started to get the idea that these were fashionable, high priced headphones.

06:26.360 --> 06:32.980
The high priced, solid heavy materials, sturdy packaging, and celebrity endorsements all

06:32.980 --> 06:38.340
raised people's expectations, and likely psychologically made the headphones sound

06:38.340 --> 06:41.100
better, just like with the name brand medicines.
