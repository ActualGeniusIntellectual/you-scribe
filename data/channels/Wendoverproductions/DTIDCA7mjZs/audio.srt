00:00:08,820 --> 00:00:15,040
The United States, despite its geopolitical prominence, is flanked by but two countries.

4
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:22,280
To the north, the 5,525 mile, 8,891 kilometer line separating it from Canada represents

5
00:00:22,280 --> 00:00:24,500
the longest border in the world.

6
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:31,940
To the south, the 1,954 mile, 3,145 kilometer US-Mexico border is perhaps one of the most

7
00:00:31,940 --> 00:00:34,220
significant in the world.

8
00:00:34,220 --> 00:00:38,220
It separates two of the most economically and socially interlinked countries in the

9
00:00:38,220 --> 00:00:39,220
world.

10
00:00:39,220 --> 00:00:43,700
The US buys more from Mexico than any other country, Mexico buys more from the US than

11
00:00:43,700 --> 00:00:48,060
any other country, and Mexico sells more to the US than any other country.

12
00:00:48,060 --> 00:00:53,820
Beyond that, there are some 37 million people living in the US with Mexican ancestry which

13
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:56,420
is a truly staggering statistic.

14
00:00:56,420 --> 00:00:59,820
That means there are more Mexicans living in the US than there are people living in

15
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:02,340
Canada full stop.

16
00:01:02,340 --> 00:01:07,260
Both the US and Mexico rely hugely on this continuous flow of people and money back and

17
00:01:07,260 --> 00:01:13,500
forth which means how well this border functions is directly tied to the success of both countries.

18
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:19,000
Unfortunately for both, though, this border, while significant, has its issues.

19
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:23,540
A border and its effectiveness involves far more than the line itself—it's about how

20
00:01:23,540 --> 00:01:28,260
well the overall immigration system between the two countries functions—but, at the

21
00:01:28,260 --> 00:01:31,840
end of the day, that line is still quite important.

22
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:36,420
The Mexico-US border is crossed more than any other, restricted border in the world,

23
00:01:36,420 --> 00:01:38,900
meaning it's actually quite porous.

24
00:01:38,900 --> 00:01:42,620
There are 50 spots where one can legally cross the border by land.

25
00:01:42,620 --> 00:01:47,420
The smallest is the tiny Boquillas Port of Entry in Big Bend National Park where about

26
00:01:47,420 --> 00:01:52,820
11,000 annual travelers are processed remotely using video inspection kiosks, mostly to make

27
00:01:52,820 --> 00:01:56,980
day trips to the small Mexican town of Boquillas del Carmen while vacationing in the national

28
00:01:56,980 --> 00:01:57,980
park.

29
00:01:57,980 --> 00:02:02,080
On the other hand, the largest crossing is the San Ysidro Port of Entry, processing

30
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:07,860
11 million pedestrians and 26 million cars per year—thereby making it the busiest land

31
00:02:07,860 --> 00:02:10,780
border checkpoint in the western hemisphere.

32
00:02:10,780 --> 00:02:15,180
As part of the primary route between San Diego and Tijuana, two cities between which people

33
00:02:15,180 --> 00:02:19,660
commute on a daily basis, this crossing is never not busy.

34
00:02:19,660 --> 00:02:27,740
The rest of this 1,954 mile, 3,145 kilometer line, beyond those 50 checkpoints, is secured

35
00:02:27,740 --> 00:02:32,820
as, to go from Mexico to the US or the US to Mexico, you have to go through immigration

36
00:02:32,820 --> 00:02:36,760
checkpoints—at least to do it legally.

37
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:40,940
Each and every year, hundreds of thousands or millions of people attempt to cross into

38
00:02:40,940 --> 00:02:45,580
the US via the southern border without the legal right to do so.

39
00:02:45,580 --> 00:02:48,340
In short, they try to migrate illegally.

40
00:02:48,340 --> 00:02:53,900
Now, the vast majority of these undocumented immigrants are not successful in their endeavor—an

41
00:02:53,900 --> 00:03:00,300
estimated 55-85% of them are caught and sent back to their home country—but to many people,

42
00:03:00,300 --> 00:03:02,180
these odds are worth it.

43
00:03:02,180 --> 00:03:07,700
There is enormous economic disparity between the US, where average income is $65,000 per

44
00:03:07,700 --> 00:03:13,100
year, and Mexico, where that number stands at $9,500 per year.

45
00:03:13,100 --> 00:03:17,500
Also, while low compared to other wealthy countries, the US scores much better than

46
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:22,140
Mexico on social mobility, meaning a poor person is more likely to become wealthier

47
00:03:22,140 --> 00:03:24,980
in their lifetime in the US than Mexico.

48
00:03:24,980 --> 00:03:28,500
In short, while there are certainly nearly infinite reasons why someone might choose

49
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:33,780
to migrate to the US, including, quite often, family reunification or an escape from violence,

50
00:03:33,780 --> 00:03:38,220
research has shown that money, and the attempt to escape poverty, is typically the strongest

51
00:03:38,220 --> 00:03:40,060
and primary one.

52
00:03:40,060 --> 00:03:44,780
Of course, the question is, why don't these people migrate to the US legally?

53
00:03:44,780 --> 00:03:47,020
It would certainly be safer and cheaper.

54
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:51,580
Well, overwhelmingly, the answer is because they can't.

55
00:03:51,580 --> 00:03:57,460
For some people, there is no legitimate route to legal status in the US and, to others,

56
00:03:57,460 --> 00:03:59,180
there's no practical way.

57
00:03:59,180 --> 00:04:04,240
Many forms of American immigrant visas have annual caps that are not proportional to immigration

58
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:06,200
demand from a given country.

59
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:10,660
That means that, for example, if you were a married Mexican citizen who was the son

60
00:04:10,660 --> 00:04:15,560
or daughter of a US citizen, the wait time to have your visa processed currently stands

61
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:18,220
at 24 years.

62
00:04:18,220 --> 00:04:23,400
That means that now, in September 2020, they're currently only processing applications submitted

63
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:26,520
up until August 1st, 1996.

64
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:30,720
Faced with the prospect of waiting 24 years, more than a fourth of their life, until they

65
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:35,000
can live and work in the same country as their parents or, for example, take care of them

66
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:40,520
in old age, many people seeking this and other classes of visas choose not to wait, and rather

67
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:46,640
take the faster, yet riskier option of immigrating without authorization.

68
00:04:46,640 --> 00:04:51,400
While dangerous, the process of crossing the border illegally is a path generally not taken

69
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:52,400
alone.

70
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:57,480
Back 20 years ago, people had to figure out this process themselves, but nowadays, upwards

71
00:04:57,480 --> 00:05:02,160
of 95% of first-time crossers hire a smuggler to help them.

72
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:08,240
That's an expensive proposition, with the average fee hovering around $3,500 per person—about

73
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:10,700
four months' wages for the average Mexican.

74
00:05:10,700 --> 00:05:14,680
In exchange for their fees, these smugglers will generally group migrants together, transport

75
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:18,580
them to the border, give them instructions on how to cross, and then arrange for transportation

76
00:05:18,580 --> 00:05:20,120
on the other side.

77
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:25,400
The migrants and smugglers really have two choices in terms of which obstacle to face—the

78
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:28,120
border security itself, or nature.

79
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:33,480
There is never no security, but in many places there is minimal as hundreds of miles of empty,

80
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:37,760
dry desert plains lay between the border and the nearest city, where migrants can disappear

81
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:39,360
into the crowd.

82
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:44,440
This sheer isolation is a big reason why there is no physical man-made barrier on the border

83
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:49,800
in almost all of Texas and across many other stretches in New Mexico, Arizona, and California.

84
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:55,320
It's tough to get an exact figure as it's ever-changing and poorly recorded, but currently,

85
00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:59,000
only about a third of the border is secured with a barrier.

86
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:03,400
In fact, the majority of that third takes the form of a vehicle barrier, intended only

87
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:07,760
to stop a car or truck from driving across the border, rather than a full pedestrian

88
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:08,760
barrier.

89
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:13,640
Generally, there's only a pedestrian barrier in heavily populated areas like Brownsville,

90
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:16,260
El Paso, Yuma, and San Diego.

91
00:06:16,260 --> 00:06:21,280
Even in these populated areas, one doesn't have to go far to find a gap in the wall.

92
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:24,720
Starting from the western end of the border at the Pacific Ocean, the first wall-less

93
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:30,040
section appears less than 15 miles or 23 kilometers to the east at the first section of steep

94
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:31,160
terrain.

95
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:35,200
Any barrier, though, doesn't tend to be too much of an issue for smugglers.

96
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:40,480
Often, they'll have scouts on both sides, wait for Border Patrol to leave the area,

97
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:43,480
then install a ladder and quickly climb over.

98
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:48,520
Cartels have been known to go even a step further and build tunnels under the border.

99
00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:54,720
In January 2020, US Customs and Border Protection discovered the longest ever, a 4,300-foot,

100
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:58,440
1,300-meter structure stretching from Tijuana to San Diego.

101
00:06:58,440 --> 00:07:03,140
This facility was so advanced that it had ventilation, electricity, a rail system, and

102
00:07:03,140 --> 00:07:04,140
even an elevator.

103
00:07:04,140 --> 00:07:09,440
While it's unclear exactly who built and operated this tunnel, in the past, many of

104
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:13,820
these have been linked to large crime syndicates like the Sinaloa Cartel, demonstrating the

105
00:07:13,820 --> 00:07:17,160
unintended consequences that securing the border can have.

106
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:21,700
Demand for hard drugs is fairly inelastic, meaning people who consume them are going

107
00:07:21,700 --> 00:07:24,080
to buy them no matter the cost.

108
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:27,640
As it gets harder and harder for drugs and other controlled substances to be smuggled

109
00:07:27,640 --> 00:07:32,320
across, the cartels are still going to transport their product, but they're just going to

110
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:34,920
use more advanced tactics.

111
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:40,180
These tactics are going to be too costly or difficult for smaller smugglers, but the cartels,

112
00:07:40,180 --> 00:07:46,000
with their vast resources, will be able to build tunnels, use drones, or use other tactics,

113
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:49,680
and with their smaller competition unable to transport goods, they're also going to

114
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:51,160
be able to raise prices.

115
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:57,340
Therefore, there's a possibility that making smuggling harder is helping the largest cartels

116
00:07:57,340 --> 00:07:59,480
make more money.

117
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:02,980
A related effect happens with the human side of smuggling.

118
00:08:02,980 --> 00:08:07,140
Naturally, the sections of the border that are most secured are those that are easiest

119
00:08:07,140 --> 00:08:12,340
to cross—those near population centers, roads, and areas with less treacherous terrain.

120
00:08:12,340 --> 00:08:17,380
That means that, as the border is secured, that pushes migrants to more and more remote

121
00:08:17,380 --> 00:08:22,060
areas where the chances of injury or death is higher and higher.

122
00:08:22,060 --> 00:08:27,220
One of the more common places for migrants to now cross into the US is the Sonoran Desert.

123
00:08:27,220 --> 00:08:31,900
This area is incredibly desolate and harsh, with high temperatures in the summer rarely

124
00:08:31,900 --> 00:08:36,660
dipping below 100 degrees Fahrenheit or 38 degrees Celsius, and winter nighttime lows

125
00:08:36,660 --> 00:08:38,540
dipping below freezing.

126
00:08:38,540 --> 00:08:44,080
The most accessible section, next to a Mexican federal highway, has a pedestrian fence preventing

127
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:45,080
crossing.

128
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:50,060
As these data show, this is effective at pushing migrants further to the east.

129
00:08:50,060 --> 00:08:53,660
After getting dropped off near the border on the Mexican side, migrants will fairly

130
00:08:53,660 --> 00:08:58,340
immediately cross the border, which is usually one of the easiest components of their trips.

131
00:08:58,340 --> 00:09:03,660
The closest roads in the US to the border in this area are highways 85 and 86, but as

132
00:09:03,660 --> 00:09:08,940
there are so few roads here, these are major choke points where migrants could be caught.

133
00:09:08,940 --> 00:09:13,740
In addition, US Customs and Border Protection have internal checkpoints where they question

134
00:09:13,740 --> 00:09:18,580
drivers and, potentially, pull them aside for search to determine if anyone is undocumented

135
00:09:18,580 --> 00:09:20,620
or smuggling illegal substances.

136
00:09:20,620 --> 00:09:26,660
Therefore, at the very least, migrants need to walk 20 to 30 miles to highway 86 in order

137
00:09:26,660 --> 00:09:29,060
to avoid the internal checkpoint.

138
00:09:29,060 --> 00:09:33,660
Many might go further, all the way to Interstate 8, with the end goal of making it to Phoenix

139
00:09:33,660 --> 00:09:34,980
or Tucson.

140
00:09:34,980 --> 00:09:39,140
As soon as a migrant gets to one of these spots, it is far easier to blend into the

141
00:09:39,140 --> 00:09:42,980
crowd as both cities have large immigrant populations.

142
00:09:42,980 --> 00:09:46,940
From there, they'll be able to catch public transportation to their final destination.

143
00:09:46,940 --> 00:09:50,520
Many, however, don't make it that far.

144
00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:53,440
And not because they are caught by border patrol.

145
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:59,800
This map, showed earlier, displays the sight of every confirmed migrant death in Arizona.

146
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:06,720
The true number, as these only represent those that are found, is likely devastatingly higher.

147
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:12,800
Every year, many hundreds of individuals die on their journey to a better life.

148
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:16,760
In response to the staggering death toll in this area, different groups have initiated

149
00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:21,120
efforts to help those that are dehydrated, hypothermic, or otherwise injured.

150
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:25,800
The US Customs and Border Protection Agency itself built a system of alert beacons in

151
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:28,800
this area that those in distress can activate.

152
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:33,520
In response, agents are supposed to arrive and help the individual, but, of course, in

153
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:37,820
the end, they will be deported if they lack legal status.

154
00:10:37,820 --> 00:10:41,340
Other non-governmental groups have also initiated efforts.

155
00:10:41,340 --> 00:10:45,960
One of the major causes of death is dehydration, with there being essentially no natural water

156
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:50,560
sources in this area, so humanitarian groups have set up water stations at spots in the

157
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:54,400
desert that migrants can use if they're in a dire situation.

158
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:57,960
Of course, both of these interventions are controversial.

159
00:10:57,960 --> 00:11:00,820
Humanitarian groups say that the beacons are tricking migrants into getting themselves

160
00:11:00,820 --> 00:11:04,800
arrested since there's no clear indication that it's border patrol that will arrive

161
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:08,420
and ultimately arrest them, rather than an ambulance or humanitarian group, while the

162
00:11:08,420 --> 00:11:12,600
border patrol says that the water stations push migrants to further continue their dangerous

163
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:17,200
journey where they might perish due to another situation, such as hypothermia, therefore

164
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:19,560
putting them at further risk.

165
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:23,860
At the end of the day, though, both of these interventions deal with the downstream effect

166
00:11:23,860 --> 00:11:27,960
of illegal immigration, rather than the actual source cause of it.

167
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:32,700
True, complete physical border security can work somewhat.

168
00:11:32,700 --> 00:11:38,400
It certainly cannot stop illegal immigration, but it does curb it, to an extent, but it

169
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:42,860
is hugely expensive and almost certainly is not the easiest solution.

170
00:11:42,860 --> 00:11:47,220
The cause of illegal immigration is not that the border isn't secured, and it's not

171
00:11:47,220 --> 00:11:51,700
even that the countries that migrants come from are impoverished or dangerous—the cause

172
00:11:51,700 --> 00:11:57,460
of illegal immigration is that legal immigration is not an option.

173
00:11:57,460 --> 00:12:02,220
Nobody wants to risk their life just to move to a new country and live in fear of deportation

174
00:12:02,220 --> 00:12:04,060
for the rest of their life.

175
00:12:04,060 --> 00:12:08,520
When Americans want to move to Canada, for example, they don't sneak across the border—they

176
00:12:08,520 --> 00:12:12,220
don't live undocumented for the rest of their life, restraining themselves to only

177
00:12:12,220 --> 00:12:14,080
certain low-paid jobs.

178
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:18,440
They take the easier route, the legal route, because they can.

179
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:22,360
If they are denied, it is generally due to certain qualifications they lack, so they

180
00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:25,280
go off and gain those qualifications.

181
00:12:25,280 --> 00:12:30,160
Many people in Mexico, Central America, and other less wealthy areas, meanwhile, simply

182
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:34,580
don't even have an option of migrating to the US legally.

183
00:12:34,580 --> 00:12:39,340
There is no reasonable, legal path like Americans have for Canada.

184
00:12:39,340 --> 00:12:43,840
Canada, a country whose immigration system is certainly not perfect, has essentially

185
00:12:43,840 --> 00:12:49,980
halted illegal immigration despite bordering a country home to tens of millions of undocumented

186
00:12:49,980 --> 00:12:50,980
migrants.

187
00:12:50,980 --> 00:12:54,640
They certainly don't let everyone who wants to live there indefinitely do so, but they

188
00:12:54,640 --> 00:13:00,280
at least have a reasonable, feasible path to legal status for anyone, no matter their

189
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:03,460
country of origin or economic situation.

190
00:13:03,460 --> 00:13:08,940
When they can go through the safe, legal route, there's no good reason for people to migrate

191
00:13:08,940 --> 00:13:10,440
illegally.

192
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:15,060
Building physical systems to stop illegal immigration might make sense if it were a

193
00:13:15,060 --> 00:13:17,900
physical problem, but it's not.

194
00:13:17,900 --> 00:13:22,340
People don't cross the border outside official channels because it's physically possible.

195
00:13:22,340 --> 00:13:27,320
That's a pull factor, but illegal immigration is caused by push factors.

196
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:33,160
It's a social problem, so to solve it and cut it down, you need social systems—such

197
00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:42,000
as a real immigration system that gives opportunities to all, not just those that are lucky.

198
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:46,360
Your virtual identity is more important than ever, especially as business is increasingly

199
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:48,000
conducted online.

200
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:51,760
Just as you present yourself right when working in person by showering, shaving, and dressing

201
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:55,360
well, you want to be sure you're presenting yourself right online, and one of the best

202
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:59,860
ways that I used to do that is a custom domain for my website and email.

203
00:13:59,860 --> 00:14:05,340
I buy all my domains through Hover, as they have clear, fair pricing, a super-fast search

204
00:14:05,340 --> 00:14:10,140
and purchase process, and over 400 domain extensions that make it super easy to find

205
00:14:10,140 --> 00:14:11,980
a super unique domain.

206
00:14:11,980 --> 00:14:16,500
For example, all of my company's emails end in "@wendover.productions," rather

207
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:19,540
than a typical .com or .net domain.

208
00:14:19,540 --> 00:14:23,200
You can make your email address or website stand out by doing this, too, and it's worth

209
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:27,080
doing now because every day, more and more domains are taken.

210
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:31,640
Hover's pricing is so fair that whenever I have an idea for something new, the first

211
00:14:31,640 --> 00:14:36,480
thing I do is buy the corresponding domain to be sure it's not taken by someone else.

212
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:40,440
Whether it's the name of your YouTube channel, your business, or just your actual name, buy

213
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:45,520
your domain and improve your online identity now for 10% off by going to hover.com slash

214
00:14:45,520 --> 00:14:48,820
Wendover and you'll be supporting the channel while you're at it.
