00:08.820 --> 00:15.040
The United States, despite its geopolitical prominence, is flanked by but two countries.

00:15.040 --> 00:22.280
To the north, the 5,525 mile, 8,891 kilometer line separating it from Canada represents

00:22.280 --> 00:24.500
the longest border in the world.

00:24.500 --> 00:31.940
To the south, the 1,954 mile, 3,145 kilometer US-Mexico border is perhaps one of the most

00:31.940 --> 00:34.220
significant in the world.

00:34.220 --> 00:38.220
It separates two of the most economically and socially interlinked countries in the

00:38.220 --> 00:39.220
world.

00:39.220 --> 00:43.700
The US buys more from Mexico than any other country, Mexico buys more from the US than

00:43.700 --> 00:48.060
any other country, and Mexico sells more to the US than any other country.

00:48.060 --> 00:53.820
Beyond that, there are some 37 million people living in the US with Mexican ancestry which

00:53.820 --> 00:56.420
is a truly staggering statistic.

00:56.420 --> 00:59.820
That means there are more Mexicans living in the US than there are people living in

00:59.820 --> 01:02.340
Canada full stop.

01:02.340 --> 01:07.260
Both the US and Mexico rely hugely on this continuous flow of people and money back and

01:07.260 --> 01:13.500
forth which means how well this border functions is directly tied to the success of both countries.

01:13.500 --> 01:19.000
Unfortunately for both, though, this border, while significant, has its issues.

01:19.000 --> 01:23.540
A border and its effectiveness involves far more than the line itself—it's about how

01:23.540 --> 01:28.260
well the overall immigration system between the two countries functions—but, at the

01:28.260 --> 01:31.840
end of the day, that line is still quite important.

01:31.840 --> 01:36.420
The Mexico-US border is crossed more than any other, restricted border in the world,

01:36.420 --> 01:38.900
meaning it's actually quite porous.

01:38.900 --> 01:42.620
There are 50 spots where one can legally cross the border by land.

01:42.620 --> 01:47.420
The smallest is the tiny Boquillas Port of Entry in Big Bend National Park where about

01:47.420 --> 01:52.820
11,000 annual travelers are processed remotely using video inspection kiosks, mostly to make

01:52.820 --> 01:56.980
day trips to the small Mexican town of Boquillas del Carmen while vacationing in the national

01:56.980 --> 01:57.980
park.

01:57.980 --> 02:02.080
On the other hand, the largest crossing is the San Ysidro Port of Entry, processing

02:02.080 --> 02:07.860
11 million pedestrians and 26 million cars per year—thereby making it the busiest land

02:07.860 --> 02:10.780
border checkpoint in the western hemisphere.

02:10.780 --> 02:15.180
As part of the primary route between San Diego and Tijuana, two cities between which people

02:15.180 --> 02:19.660
commute on a daily basis, this crossing is never not busy.

02:19.660 --> 02:27.740
The rest of this 1,954 mile, 3,145 kilometer line, beyond those 50 checkpoints, is secured

02:27.740 --> 02:32.820
as, to go from Mexico to the US or the US to Mexico, you have to go through immigration

02:32.820 --> 02:36.760
checkpoints—at least to do it legally.

02:36.760 --> 02:40.940
Each and every year, hundreds of thousands or millions of people attempt to cross into

02:40.940 --> 02:45.580
the US via the southern border without the legal right to do so.

02:45.580 --> 02:48.340
In short, they try to migrate illegally.

02:48.340 --> 02:53.900
Now, the vast majority of these undocumented immigrants are not successful in their endeavor—an

02:53.900 --> 03:00.300
estimated 55-85% of them are caught and sent back to their home country—but to many people,

03:00.300 --> 03:02.180
these odds are worth it.

03:02.180 --> 03:07.700
There is enormous economic disparity between the US, where average income is $65,000 per

03:07.700 --> 03:13.100
year, and Mexico, where that number stands at $9,500 per year.

03:13.100 --> 03:17.500
Also, while low compared to other wealthy countries, the US scores much better than

03:17.500 --> 03:22.140
Mexico on social mobility, meaning a poor person is more likely to become wealthier

03:22.140 --> 03:24.980
in their lifetime in the US than Mexico.

03:24.980 --> 03:28.500
In short, while there are certainly nearly infinite reasons why someone might choose

03:28.500 --> 03:33.780
to migrate to the US, including, quite often, family reunification or an escape from violence,

03:33.780 --> 03:38.220
research has shown that money, and the attempt to escape poverty, is typically the strongest

03:38.220 --> 03:40.060
and primary one.

03:40.060 --> 03:44.780
Of course, the question is, why don't these people migrate to the US legally?

03:44.780 --> 03:47.020
It would certainly be safer and cheaper.

03:47.060 --> 03:51.580
Well, overwhelmingly, the answer is because they can't.

03:51.580 --> 03:57.460
For some people, there is no legitimate route to legal status in the US and, to others,

03:57.460 --> 03:59.180
there's no practical way.

03:59.180 --> 04:04.240
Many forms of American immigrant visas have annual caps that are not proportional to immigration

04:04.240 --> 04:06.200
demand from a given country.

04:06.200 --> 04:10.660
That means that, for example, if you were a married Mexican citizen who was the son

04:10.660 --> 04:15.560
or daughter of a US citizen, the wait time to have your visa processed currently stands

04:15.600 --> 04:18.220
at 24 years.

04:18.220 --> 04:23.400
That means that now, in September 2020, they're currently only processing applications submitted

04:23.400 --> 04:26.520
up until August 1st, 1996.

04:26.520 --> 04:30.720
Faced with the prospect of waiting 24 years, more than a fourth of their life, until they

04:30.720 --> 04:35.000
can live and work in the same country as their parents or, for example, take care of them

04:35.000 --> 04:40.520
in old age, many people seeking this and other classes of visas choose not to wait, and rather

04:40.520 --> 04:46.640
take the faster, yet riskier option of immigrating without authorization.

04:46.640 --> 04:51.400
While dangerous, the process of crossing the border illegally is a path generally not taken

04:51.400 --> 04:52.400
alone.

04:52.400 --> 04:57.480
Back 20 years ago, people had to figure out this process themselves, but nowadays, upwards

04:57.480 --> 05:02.160
of 95% of first-time crossers hire a smuggler to help them.

05:02.160 --> 05:08.240
That's an expensive proposition, with the average fee hovering around $3,500 per person—about

05:08.240 --> 05:10.700
four months' wages for the average Mexican.

05:10.700 --> 05:14.680
In exchange for their fees, these smugglers will generally group migrants together, transport

05:14.680 --> 05:18.580
them to the border, give them instructions on how to cross, and then arrange for transportation

05:18.580 --> 05:20.120
on the other side.

05:20.120 --> 05:25.400
The migrants and smugglers really have two choices in terms of which obstacle to face—the

05:25.400 --> 05:28.120
border security itself, or nature.

05:28.120 --> 05:33.480
There is never no security, but in many places there is minimal as hundreds of miles of empty,

05:33.480 --> 05:37.760
dry desert plains lay between the border and the nearest city, where migrants can disappear

05:37.760 --> 05:39.360
into the crowd.

05:39.360 --> 05:44.440
This sheer isolation is a big reason why there is no physical man-made barrier on the border

05:44.440 --> 05:49.800
in almost all of Texas and across many other stretches in New Mexico, Arizona, and California.

05:49.800 --> 05:55.320
It's tough to get an exact figure as it's ever-changing and poorly recorded, but currently,

05:55.320 --> 05:59.000
only about a third of the border is secured with a barrier.

05:59.000 --> 06:03.400
In fact, the majority of that third takes the form of a vehicle barrier, intended only

06:03.400 --> 06:07.760
to stop a car or truck from driving across the border, rather than a full pedestrian

06:07.760 --> 06:08.760
barrier.

06:08.760 --> 06:13.640
Generally, there's only a pedestrian barrier in heavily populated areas like Brownsville,

06:13.640 --> 06:16.260
El Paso, Yuma, and San Diego.

06:16.260 --> 06:21.280
Even in these populated areas, one doesn't have to go far to find a gap in the wall.

06:21.280 --> 06:24.720
Starting from the western end of the border at the Pacific Ocean, the first wall-less

06:24.720 --> 06:30.040
section appears less than 15 miles or 23 kilometers to the east at the first section of steep

06:30.040 --> 06:31.160
terrain.

06:31.160 --> 06:35.200
Any barrier, though, doesn't tend to be too much of an issue for smugglers.

06:35.200 --> 06:40.480
Often, they'll have scouts on both sides, wait for Border Patrol to leave the area,

06:40.480 --> 06:43.480
then install a ladder and quickly climb over.

06:43.480 --> 06:48.520
Cartels have been known to go even a step further and build tunnels under the border.

06:48.520 --> 06:54.720
In January 2020, US Customs and Border Protection discovered the longest ever, a 4,300-foot,

06:54.720 --> 06:58.440
1,300-meter structure stretching from Tijuana to San Diego.

06:58.440 --> 07:03.140
This facility was so advanced that it had ventilation, electricity, a rail system, and

07:03.140 --> 07:04.140
even an elevator.

07:04.140 --> 07:09.440
While it's unclear exactly who built and operated this tunnel, in the past, many of

07:09.440 --> 07:13.820
these have been linked to large crime syndicates like the Sinaloa Cartel, demonstrating the

07:13.820 --> 07:17.160
unintended consequences that securing the border can have.

07:17.160 --> 07:21.700
Demand for hard drugs is fairly inelastic, meaning people who consume them are going

07:21.700 --> 07:24.080
to buy them no matter the cost.

07:24.080 --> 07:27.640
As it gets harder and harder for drugs and other controlled substances to be smuggled

07:27.640 --> 07:32.320
across, the cartels are still going to transport their product, but they're just going to

07:32.320 --> 07:34.920
use more advanced tactics.

07:34.920 --> 07:40.180
These tactics are going to be too costly or difficult for smaller smugglers, but the cartels,

07:40.180 --> 07:46.000
with their vast resources, will be able to build tunnels, use drones, or use other tactics,

07:46.000 --> 07:49.680
and with their smaller competition unable to transport goods, they're also going to

07:49.680 --> 07:51.160
be able to raise prices.

07:51.160 --> 07:57.340
Therefore, there's a possibility that making smuggling harder is helping the largest cartels

07:57.340 --> 07:59.480
make more money.

07:59.480 --> 08:02.980
A related effect happens with the human side of smuggling.

08:02.980 --> 08:07.140
Naturally, the sections of the border that are most secured are those that are easiest

08:07.140 --> 08:12.340
to cross—those near population centers, roads, and areas with less treacherous terrain.

08:12.340 --> 08:17.380
That means that, as the border is secured, that pushes migrants to more and more remote

08:17.380 --> 08:22.060
areas where the chances of injury or death is higher and higher.

08:22.060 --> 08:27.220
One of the more common places for migrants to now cross into the US is the Sonoran Desert.

08:27.220 --> 08:31.900
This area is incredibly desolate and harsh, with high temperatures in the summer rarely

08:31.900 --> 08:36.660
dipping below 100 degrees Fahrenheit or 38 degrees Celsius, and winter nighttime lows

08:36.660 --> 08:38.540
dipping below freezing.

08:38.540 --> 08:44.080
The most accessible section, next to a Mexican federal highway, has a pedestrian fence preventing

08:44.080 --> 08:45.080
crossing.

08:45.080 --> 08:50.060
As these data show, this is effective at pushing migrants further to the east.

08:50.060 --> 08:53.660
After getting dropped off near the border on the Mexican side, migrants will fairly

08:53.660 --> 08:58.340
immediately cross the border, which is usually one of the easiest components of their trips.

08:58.340 --> 09:03.660
The closest roads in the US to the border in this area are highways 85 and 86, but as

09:03.660 --> 09:08.940
there are so few roads here, these are major choke points where migrants could be caught.

09:08.940 --> 09:13.740
In addition, US Customs and Border Protection have internal checkpoints where they question

09:13.740 --> 09:18.580
drivers and, potentially, pull them aside for search to determine if anyone is undocumented

09:18.580 --> 09:20.620
or smuggling illegal substances.

09:20.620 --> 09:26.660
Therefore, at the very least, migrants need to walk 20 to 30 miles to highway 86 in order

09:26.660 --> 09:29.060
to avoid the internal checkpoint.

09:29.060 --> 09:33.660
Many might go further, all the way to Interstate 8, with the end goal of making it to Phoenix

09:33.660 --> 09:34.980
or Tucson.

09:34.980 --> 09:39.140
As soon as a migrant gets to one of these spots, it is far easier to blend into the

09:39.140 --> 09:42.980
crowd as both cities have large immigrant populations.

09:42.980 --> 09:46.940
From there, they'll be able to catch public transportation to their final destination.

09:46.940 --> 09:50.520
Many, however, don't make it that far.

09:50.520 --> 09:53.440
And not because they are caught by border patrol.

09:53.440 --> 09:59.800
This map, showed earlier, displays the sight of every confirmed migrant death in Arizona.

09:59.800 --> 10:06.720
The true number, as these only represent those that are found, is likely devastatingly higher.

10:06.720 --> 10:12.800
Every year, many hundreds of individuals die on their journey to a better life.

10:12.800 --> 10:16.760
In response to the staggering death toll in this area, different groups have initiated

10:16.760 --> 10:21.120
efforts to help those that are dehydrated, hypothermic, or otherwise injured.

10:21.120 --> 10:25.800
The US Customs and Border Protection Agency itself built a system of alert beacons in

10:25.800 --> 10:28.800
this area that those in distress can activate.

10:28.800 --> 10:33.520
In response, agents are supposed to arrive and help the individual, but, of course, in

10:33.520 --> 10:37.820
the end, they will be deported if they lack legal status.

10:37.820 --> 10:41.340
Other non-governmental groups have also initiated efforts.

10:41.340 --> 10:45.960
One of the major causes of death is dehydration, with there being essentially no natural water

10:45.960 --> 10:50.560
sources in this area, so humanitarian groups have set up water stations at spots in the

10:50.560 --> 10:54.400
desert that migrants can use if they're in a dire situation.

10:54.400 --> 10:57.960
Of course, both of these interventions are controversial.

10:57.960 --> 11:00.820
Humanitarian groups say that the beacons are tricking migrants into getting themselves

11:00.820 --> 11:04.800
arrested since there's no clear indication that it's border patrol that will arrive

11:04.800 --> 11:08.420
and ultimately arrest them, rather than an ambulance or humanitarian group, while the

11:08.420 --> 11:12.600
border patrol says that the water stations push migrants to further continue their dangerous

11:12.600 --> 11:17.200
journey where they might perish due to another situation, such as hypothermia, therefore

11:17.200 --> 11:19.560
putting them at further risk.

11:19.560 --> 11:23.860
At the end of the day, though, both of these interventions deal with the downstream effect

11:23.860 --> 11:27.960
of illegal immigration, rather than the actual source cause of it.

11:27.960 --> 11:32.700
True, complete physical border security can work somewhat.

11:32.700 --> 11:38.400
It certainly cannot stop illegal immigration, but it does curb it, to an extent, but it

11:38.400 --> 11:42.860
is hugely expensive and almost certainly is not the easiest solution.

11:42.860 --> 11:47.220
The cause of illegal immigration is not that the border isn't secured, and it's not

11:47.220 --> 11:51.700
even that the countries that migrants come from are impoverished or dangerous—the cause

11:51.700 --> 11:57.460
of illegal immigration is that legal immigration is not an option.

11:57.460 --> 12:02.220
Nobody wants to risk their life just to move to a new country and live in fear of deportation

12:02.220 --> 12:04.060
for the rest of their life.

12:04.060 --> 12:08.520
When Americans want to move to Canada, for example, they don't sneak across the border—they

12:08.520 --> 12:12.220
don't live undocumented for the rest of their life, restraining themselves to only

12:12.220 --> 12:14.080
certain low-paid jobs.

12:14.080 --> 12:18.440
They take the easier route, the legal route, because they can.

12:18.440 --> 12:22.360
If they are denied, it is generally due to certain qualifications they lack, so they

12:22.360 --> 12:25.280
go off and gain those qualifications.

12:25.280 --> 12:30.160
Many people in Mexico, Central America, and other less wealthy areas, meanwhile, simply

12:30.160 --> 12:34.580
don't even have an option of migrating to the US legally.

12:34.580 --> 12:39.340
There is no reasonable, legal path like Americans have for Canada.

12:39.340 --> 12:43.840
Canada, a country whose immigration system is certainly not perfect, has essentially

12:43.840 --> 12:49.980
halted illegal immigration despite bordering a country home to tens of millions of undocumented

12:49.980 --> 12:50.980
migrants.

12:50.980 --> 12:54.640
They certainly don't let everyone who wants to live there indefinitely do so, but they

12:54.640 --> 13:00.280
at least have a reasonable, feasible path to legal status for anyone, no matter their

13:00.280 --> 13:03.460
country of origin or economic situation.

13:03.460 --> 13:08.940
When they can go through the safe, legal route, there's no good reason for people to migrate

13:08.940 --> 13:10.440
illegally.

13:10.440 --> 13:15.060
Building physical systems to stop illegal immigration might make sense if it were a

13:15.060 --> 13:17.900
physical problem, but it's not.

13:17.900 --> 13:22.340
People don't cross the border outside official channels because it's physically possible.

13:22.340 --> 13:27.320
That's a pull factor, but illegal immigration is caused by push factors.

13:27.320 --> 13:33.160
It's a social problem, so to solve it and cut it down, you need social systems—such

13:33.160 --> 13:42.000
as a real immigration system that gives opportunities to all, not just those that are lucky.

13:42.000 --> 13:46.360
Your virtual identity is more important than ever, especially as business is increasingly

13:46.360 --> 13:48.000
conducted online.

13:48.000 --> 13:51.760
Just as you present yourself right when working in person by showering, shaving, and dressing

13:51.760 --> 13:55.360
well, you want to be sure you're presenting yourself right online, and one of the best

13:55.360 --> 13:59.860
ways that I used to do that is a custom domain for my website and email.

13:59.860 --> 14:05.340
I buy all my domains through Hover, as they have clear, fair pricing, a super-fast search

14:05.340 --> 14:10.140
and purchase process, and over 400 domain extensions that make it super easy to find

14:10.140 --> 14:11.980
a super unique domain.

14:11.980 --> 14:16.500
For example, all of my company's emails end in "@wendover.productions," rather

14:16.500 --> 14:19.540
than a typical .com or .net domain.

14:19.540 --> 14:23.200
You can make your email address or website stand out by doing this, too, and it's worth

14:23.200 --> 14:27.080
doing now because every day, more and more domains are taken.

14:27.080 --> 14:31.640
Hover's pricing is so fair that whenever I have an idea for something new, the first

14:31.640 --> 14:36.480
thing I do is buy the corresponding domain to be sure it's not taken by someone else.

14:36.480 --> 14:40.440
Whether it's the name of your YouTube channel, your business, or just your actual name, buy

14:40.440 --> 14:45.520
your domain and improve your online identity now for 10% off by going to hover.com slash

14:45.520 --> 14:48.820
Wendover and you'll be supporting the channel while you're at it.
