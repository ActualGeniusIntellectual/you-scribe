8820	15040	The United States, despite its geopolitical prominence, is flanked by but two countries.
15040	22280	To the north, the 5,525 mile, 8,891 kilometer line separating it from Canada represents
22280	24500	the longest border in the world.
24500	31940	To the south, the 1,954 mile, 3,145 kilometer US-Mexico border is perhaps one of the most
31940	34220	significant in the world.
34220	38220	It separates two of the most economically and socially interlinked countries in the
38220	39220	world.
39220	43700	The US buys more from Mexico than any other country, Mexico buys more from the US than
43700	48060	any other country, and Mexico sells more to the US than any other country.
48060	53820	Beyond that, there are some 37 million people living in the US with Mexican ancestry which
53820	56420	is a truly staggering statistic.
56420	59820	That means there are more Mexicans living in the US than there are people living in
59820	62340	Canada full stop.
62340	67260	Both the US and Mexico rely hugely on this continuous flow of people and money back and
67260	73500	forth which means how well this border functions is directly tied to the success of both countries.
73500	79000	Unfortunately for both, though, this border, while significant, has its issues.
79000	83540	A border and its effectiveness involves far more than the line itself—it's about how
83540	88260	well the overall immigration system between the two countries functions—but, at the
88260	91840	end of the day, that line is still quite important.
91840	96420	The Mexico-US border is crossed more than any other, restricted border in the world,
96420	98900	meaning it's actually quite porous.
98900	102620	There are 50 spots where one can legally cross the border by land.
102620	107420	The smallest is the tiny Boquillas Port of Entry in Big Bend National Park where about
107420	112820	11,000 annual travelers are processed remotely using video inspection kiosks, mostly to make
112820	116980	day trips to the small Mexican town of Boquillas del Carmen while vacationing in the national
116980	117980	park.
117980	122080	On the other hand, the largest crossing is the San Ysidro Port of Entry, processing
122080	127860	11 million pedestrians and 26 million cars per year—thereby making it the busiest land
127860	130780	border checkpoint in the western hemisphere.
130780	135180	As part of the primary route between San Diego and Tijuana, two cities between which people
135180	139660	commute on a daily basis, this crossing is never not busy.
139660	147740	The rest of this 1,954 mile, 3,145 kilometer line, beyond those 50 checkpoints, is secured
147740	152820	as, to go from Mexico to the US or the US to Mexico, you have to go through immigration
152820	156760	checkpoints—at least to do it legally.
156760	160940	Each and every year, hundreds of thousands or millions of people attempt to cross into
160940	165580	the US via the southern border without the legal right to do so.
165580	168340	In short, they try to migrate illegally.
168340	173900	Now, the vast majority of these undocumented immigrants are not successful in their endeavor—an
173900	180300	estimated 55-85% of them are caught and sent back to their home country—but to many people,
180300	182180	these odds are worth it.
182180	187700	There is enormous economic disparity between the US, where average income is $65,000 per
187700	193100	year, and Mexico, where that number stands at $9,500 per year.
193100	197500	Also, while low compared to other wealthy countries, the US scores much better than
197500	202140	Mexico on social mobility, meaning a poor person is more likely to become wealthier
202140	204980	in their lifetime in the US than Mexico.
204980	208500	In short, while there are certainly nearly infinite reasons why someone might choose
208500	213780	to migrate to the US, including, quite often, family reunification or an escape from violence,
213780	218220	research has shown that money, and the attempt to escape poverty, is typically the strongest
218220	220060	and primary one.
220060	224780	Of course, the question is, why don't these people migrate to the US legally?
224780	227020	It would certainly be safer and cheaper.
227060	231580	Well, overwhelmingly, the answer is because they can't.
231580	237460	For some people, there is no legitimate route to legal status in the US and, to others,
237460	239180	there's no practical way.
239180	244240	Many forms of American immigrant visas have annual caps that are not proportional to immigration
244240	246200	demand from a given country.
246200	250660	That means that, for example, if you were a married Mexican citizen who was the son
250660	255560	or daughter of a US citizen, the wait time to have your visa processed currently stands
255600	258220	at 24 years.
258220	263400	That means that now, in September 2020, they're currently only processing applications submitted
263400	266520	up until August 1st, 1996.
266520	270720	Faced with the prospect of waiting 24 years, more than a fourth of their life, until they
270720	275000	can live and work in the same country as their parents or, for example, take care of them
275000	280520	in old age, many people seeking this and other classes of visas choose not to wait, and rather
280520	286640	take the faster, yet riskier option of immigrating without authorization.
286640	291400	While dangerous, the process of crossing the border illegally is a path generally not taken
291400	292400	alone.
292400	297480	Back 20 years ago, people had to figure out this process themselves, but nowadays, upwards
297480	302160	of 95% of first-time crossers hire a smuggler to help them.
302160	308240	That's an expensive proposition, with the average fee hovering around $3,500 per person—about
308240	310700	four months' wages for the average Mexican.
310700	314680	In exchange for their fees, these smugglers will generally group migrants together, transport
314680	318580	them to the border, give them instructions on how to cross, and then arrange for transportation
318580	320120	on the other side.
320120	325400	The migrants and smugglers really have two choices in terms of which obstacle to face—the
325400	328120	border security itself, or nature.
328120	333480	There is never no security, but in many places there is minimal as hundreds of miles of empty,
333480	337760	dry desert plains lay between the border and the nearest city, where migrants can disappear
337760	339360	into the crowd.
339360	344440	This sheer isolation is a big reason why there is no physical man-made barrier on the border
344440	349800	in almost all of Texas and across many other stretches in New Mexico, Arizona, and California.
349800	355320	It's tough to get an exact figure as it's ever-changing and poorly recorded, but currently,
355320	359000	only about a third of the border is secured with a barrier.
359000	363400	In fact, the majority of that third takes the form of a vehicle barrier, intended only
363400	367760	to stop a car or truck from driving across the border, rather than a full pedestrian
367760	368760	barrier.
368760	373640	Generally, there's only a pedestrian barrier in heavily populated areas like Brownsville,
373640	376260	El Paso, Yuma, and San Diego.
376260	381280	Even in these populated areas, one doesn't have to go far to find a gap in the wall.
381280	384720	Starting from the western end of the border at the Pacific Ocean, the first wall-less
384720	390040	section appears less than 15 miles or 23 kilometers to the east at the first section of steep
390040	391160	terrain.
391160	395200	Any barrier, though, doesn't tend to be too much of an issue for smugglers.
395200	400480	Often, they'll have scouts on both sides, wait for Border Patrol to leave the area,
400480	403480	then install a ladder and quickly climb over.
403480	408520	Cartels have been known to go even a step further and build tunnels under the border.
408520	414720	In January 2020, US Customs and Border Protection discovered the longest ever, a 4,300-foot,
414720	418440	1,300-meter structure stretching from Tijuana to San Diego.
418440	423140	This facility was so advanced that it had ventilation, electricity, a rail system, and
423140	424140	even an elevator.
424140	429440	While it's unclear exactly who built and operated this tunnel, in the past, many of
429440	433820	these have been linked to large crime syndicates like the Sinaloa Cartel, demonstrating the
433820	437160	unintended consequences that securing the border can have.
437160	441700	Demand for hard drugs is fairly inelastic, meaning people who consume them are going
441700	444080	to buy them no matter the cost.
444080	447640	As it gets harder and harder for drugs and other controlled substances to be smuggled
447640	452320	across, the cartels are still going to transport their product, but they're just going to
452320	454920	use more advanced tactics.
454920	460180	These tactics are going to be too costly or difficult for smaller smugglers, but the cartels,
460180	466000	with their vast resources, will be able to build tunnels, use drones, or use other tactics,
466000	469680	and with their smaller competition unable to transport goods, they're also going to
469680	471160	be able to raise prices.
471160	477340	Therefore, there's a possibility that making smuggling harder is helping the largest cartels
477340	479480	make more money.
479480	482980	A related effect happens with the human side of smuggling.
482980	487140	Naturally, the sections of the border that are most secured are those that are easiest
487140	492340	to cross—those near population centers, roads, and areas with less treacherous terrain.
492340	497380	That means that, as the border is secured, that pushes migrants to more and more remote
497380	502060	areas where the chances of injury or death is higher and higher.
502060	507220	One of the more common places for migrants to now cross into the US is the Sonoran Desert.
507220	511900	This area is incredibly desolate and harsh, with high temperatures in the summer rarely
511900	516660	dipping below 100 degrees Fahrenheit or 38 degrees Celsius, and winter nighttime lows
516660	518540	dipping below freezing.
518540	524080	The most accessible section, next to a Mexican federal highway, has a pedestrian fence preventing
524080	525080	crossing.
525080	530060	As these data show, this is effective at pushing migrants further to the east.
530060	533660	After getting dropped off near the border on the Mexican side, migrants will fairly
533660	538340	immediately cross the border, which is usually one of the easiest components of their trips.
538340	543660	The closest roads in the US to the border in this area are highways 85 and 86, but as
543660	548940	there are so few roads here, these are major choke points where migrants could be caught.
548940	553740	In addition, US Customs and Border Protection have internal checkpoints where they question
553740	558580	drivers and, potentially, pull them aside for search to determine if anyone is undocumented
558580	560620	or smuggling illegal substances.
560620	566660	Therefore, at the very least, migrants need to walk 20 to 30 miles to highway 86 in order
566660	569060	to avoid the internal checkpoint.
569060	573660	Many might go further, all the way to Interstate 8, with the end goal of making it to Phoenix
573660	574980	or Tucson.
574980	579140	As soon as a migrant gets to one of these spots, it is far easier to blend into the
579140	582980	crowd as both cities have large immigrant populations.
582980	586940	From there, they'll be able to catch public transportation to their final destination.
586940	590520	Many, however, don't make it that far.
590520	593440	And not because they are caught by border patrol.
593440	599800	This map, showed earlier, displays the sight of every confirmed migrant death in Arizona.
599800	606720	The true number, as these only represent those that are found, is likely devastatingly higher.
606720	612800	Every year, many hundreds of individuals die on their journey to a better life.
612800	616760	In response to the staggering death toll in this area, different groups have initiated
616760	621120	efforts to help those that are dehydrated, hypothermic, or otherwise injured.
621120	625800	The US Customs and Border Protection Agency itself built a system of alert beacons in
625800	628800	this area that those in distress can activate.
628800	633520	In response, agents are supposed to arrive and help the individual, but, of course, in
633520	637820	the end, they will be deported if they lack legal status.
637820	641340	Other non-governmental groups have also initiated efforts.
641340	645960	One of the major causes of death is dehydration, with there being essentially no natural water
645960	650560	sources in this area, so humanitarian groups have set up water stations at spots in the
650560	654400	desert that migrants can use if they're in a dire situation.
654400	657960	Of course, both of these interventions are controversial.
657960	660820	Humanitarian groups say that the beacons are tricking migrants into getting themselves
660820	664800	arrested since there's no clear indication that it's border patrol that will arrive
664800	668420	and ultimately arrest them, rather than an ambulance or humanitarian group, while the
668420	672600	border patrol says that the water stations push migrants to further continue their dangerous
672600	677200	journey where they might perish due to another situation, such as hypothermia, therefore
677200	679560	putting them at further risk.
679560	683860	At the end of the day, though, both of these interventions deal with the downstream effect
683860	687960	of illegal immigration, rather than the actual source cause of it.
687960	692700	True, complete physical border security can work somewhat.
692700	698400	It certainly cannot stop illegal immigration, but it does curb it, to an extent, but it
698400	702860	is hugely expensive and almost certainly is not the easiest solution.
702860	707220	The cause of illegal immigration is not that the border isn't secured, and it's not
707220	711700	even that the countries that migrants come from are impoverished or dangerous—the cause
711700	717460	of illegal immigration is that legal immigration is not an option.
717460	722220	Nobody wants to risk their life just to move to a new country and live in fear of deportation
722220	724060	for the rest of their life.
724060	728520	When Americans want to move to Canada, for example, they don't sneak across the border—they
728520	732220	don't live undocumented for the rest of their life, restraining themselves to only
732220	734080	certain low-paid jobs.
734080	738440	They take the easier route, the legal route, because they can.
738440	742360	If they are denied, it is generally due to certain qualifications they lack, so they
742360	745280	go off and gain those qualifications.
745280	750160	Many people in Mexico, Central America, and other less wealthy areas, meanwhile, simply
750160	754580	don't even have an option of migrating to the US legally.
754580	759340	There is no reasonable, legal path like Americans have for Canada.
759340	763840	Canada, a country whose immigration system is certainly not perfect, has essentially
763840	769980	halted illegal immigration despite bordering a country home to tens of millions of undocumented
769980	770980	migrants.
770980	774640	They certainly don't let everyone who wants to live there indefinitely do so, but they
774640	780280	at least have a reasonable, feasible path to legal status for anyone, no matter their
780280	783460	country of origin or economic situation.
783460	788940	When they can go through the safe, legal route, there's no good reason for people to migrate
788940	790440	illegally.
790440	795060	Building physical systems to stop illegal immigration might make sense if it were a
795060	797900	physical problem, but it's not.
797900	802340	People don't cross the border outside official channels because it's physically possible.
802340	807320	That's a pull factor, but illegal immigration is caused by push factors.
807320	813160	It's a social problem, so to solve it and cut it down, you need social systems—such
813160	822000	as a real immigration system that gives opportunities to all, not just those that are lucky.
822000	826360	Your virtual identity is more important than ever, especially as business is increasingly
826360	828000	conducted online.
828000	831760	Just as you present yourself right when working in person by showering, shaving, and dressing
831760	835360	well, you want to be sure you're presenting yourself right online, and one of the best
835360	839860	ways that I used to do that is a custom domain for my website and email.
839860	845340	I buy all my domains through Hover, as they have clear, fair pricing, a super-fast search
845340	850140	and purchase process, and over 400 domain extensions that make it super easy to find
850140	851980	a super unique domain.
851980	856500	For example, all of my company's emails end in "@wendover.productions," rather
856500	859540	than a typical .com or .net domain.
859540	863200	You can make your email address or website stand out by doing this, too, and it's worth
863200	867080	doing now because every day, more and more domains are taken.
867080	871640	Hover's pricing is so fair that whenever I have an idea for something new, the first
871640	876480	thing I do is buy the corresponding domain to be sure it's not taken by someone else.
876480	880440	Whether it's the name of your YouTube channel, your business, or just your actual name, buy
880440	885520	your domain and improve your online identity now for 10% off by going to hover.com slash
885520	888820	Wendover and you'll be supporting the channel while you're at it.
