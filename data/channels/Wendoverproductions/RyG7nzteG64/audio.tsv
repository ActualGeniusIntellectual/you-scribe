8440	13460	On November 3rd, 2020, hundreds of millions of Americans will all make their way to their
13460	18400	local polling stations to cast their votes—deciding who will be the next President of the United
18400	20160	States of America.
20160	25160	That day will be the accumulation of a multi-year, multi-billion dollar election process, but
25160	30640	before that all truly ends, the votes need to be counted and the winner has to be declared.
30640	35920	As soon as the first polls close at 6 PM Eastern Time, there begins a massive overnight exercise
35920	40400	to count hundreds of millions of votes and, typically, declare who will next lead the
40400	43080	country by the early hours of the following morning.
43080	47220	While the true effort doesn't start until the early evening of voting day, the first
47220	52040	results come in the early morning of election day, before most polls have even opened.
52040	56280	A few small towns on the East Coast, most famously Dixville Notch, New Hampshire, all
56280	60240	compete to be the first precinct in the US to report results.
60240	64800	New Hampshire state law allows polling places in the state to close early as long as all
64800	67520	registered voters have cast their ballots.
67520	71380	Given that the town only has a dozen or so registered voters, this process is typically
71380	73820	finished in minutes or seconds.
73820	78120	In front of a cluster of cameras from nearly every major news organization, the votes are
78120	79760	read out and tallied.
79760	83840	The process of counting a dozen or so paper ballots in a small town is not tough, but
83840	88320	a few hours later, the rest of the country's polling places will open, each of which eventually
88320	92040	has to accurately count up to thousands of votes.
92040	97680	What makes the US election so difficult to conduct right is that there are over 178,000
97680	102400	individual voting precincts, each of which can and does do things in a slightly different
102400	103400	way.
103400	107000	Some use paper ballots that have to be read and interpreted manually, some use paper ballots
107000	111840	that are scanned by a machine, some use electronic voting machines, and some even allow for absentee
111840	113560	voting over the internet.
113560	116800	The selection of a voting method is a difficult balancing act.
116800	120480	Handwritten paper ballots are simple and cheap, which means that a polling station can process
120480	124960	loads of voters at once, but they're much more difficult to count.
124960	128040	Electronic voting machines are expensive and complicated, meaning they're often in short
128040	133880	supply, leading to longer lines, but counting and reporting the votes happen almost instantaneously.
133880	137340	Also a major concern in the selection of voting method is security.
137340	142400	The most secure ballot is no doubt a handwritten paper one, as submitting a fraudulent vote
142400	146040	involves physically acquiring and submitting a ballot—something that can't be easily
146040	147720	done at a large scale.
147720	152740	Arguably the least secure method is electronic voting machines, as anything electronic can
152740	154200	be hacked.
154200	158120	Almost every voting machine out there has been hacked in some way or another in controlled
158120	161020	experiments at hacker conventions such as Defcon.
161020	164940	In the real world, it's impossible to know for sure how often voting security has been
164940	169900	compromised, but we do know that these machines can be hacked which is why still today much
169900	175020	of the US votes the same way it did hundreds of years ago—on paper ballots.
175020	179520	First to close their polling places will be parts of Indiana and Kentucky at 6 PM Eastern.
179520	183400	The second that happens, everything shifts into counting mode.
183400	188040	Both states use a mix of optical scan and direct record electronic voting machines.
188040	192900	For example, the majority of Kentucky's machines are Hart Intracivic e-scans.
192900	196880	These are those optical scan electronic machines where a voter physically fills out a paper
196880	201160	ballot, shading in bubbles for their preferred candidates, then feeds the sheet into a machine
201160	205160	which scans their responses, and then records and tallies the votes.
205160	209120	In Indiana, however, the majority of their machines are micro-vote infinities which are
209120	212060	examples of direct record electronic machines.
212060	215860	These are fully electronic machines where the voter selects their candidates of choice
215860	219260	on the screen before pressing a button to cast their votes.
219260	222700	Once 6 PM rolls around, though, the machines' voting modes will be turned off, they will
222700	226700	print out a physical paper backup displaying the tally of votes for each candidate, and
226700	230740	the poll workers will remove a sort of memory device that stores the totals.
230740	235780	Every step of this process has to be witnessed by multiple people, usually of different political
235780	236780	parties.
236780	240780	These papers and memory devices are all then packed up in sealed envelopes and gathered
240780	241860	together.
241860	245460	From there, the votes need to make it to a central vote-counting location.
245460	250420	Usually, they're driven there by the county's police to assure there is no interference.
250420	252980	That works in most places, but not all.
252980	257540	For example, anyone who's been in Los Angeles in the early evening, when their polls close,
257540	261540	knows that it would take hours to get a vehicle from Gorman, on the northern end of Los Angeles
261540	264020	County, to Norwalk, where votes are tallied.
264020	268520	Therefore, the county uses helicopters to fly voting records to Norwalk from across
268520	272720	the county, and therefore ends up spending many millions of dollars on each election
272720	273720	day.
273720	278520	Traffic is less of a concern in Indiana and Kentucky, though, and so, not long after 6
278520	282780	PM eastern, votes will start arriving at their central counting locations where all the memory
282780	286800	devices will be plugged in to a tabulating computer that will record the results.
286800	290760	They'll also add in the results from early and absentee voting as well.
290760	294080	Given the electronic nature of this count, when votes have physically arrived at the
294080	298060	site, the process doesn't take long, but throughout it all, it will be observed by
298060	301360	a bipartisan grouping of poll workers and officials.
301360	305760	Of course, the way the world hears about the results of the election is not via the government
305760	308880	itself, but rather through the media.
308880	312760	Almost always, the media tells the public who will win the election before all the votes
312760	317360	have come in, and they make this call based off two key pieces of information.
317360	319720	The first is election day polling.
319720	322000	There are two competing systems of polling.
322000	326080	The first is the Associated Press' vote cast system—a relatively new method where
326080	329960	voters are polled at home via the internet and phone in the days leading up to election
329960	336680	day—and the second is the National Election Pool system used by ABC, CBS, CNN, and NBC.
336680	340780	This system uses the more traditional exit poll method where individuals leaving polling
340780	345660	stations are asked who they voted for in an attempt to gather a representative sample.
345660	349960	Both of these systems give media organizations an idea of how voters are leaning on election
349960	353620	day and help them know where the results are likely to swing.
353620	358640	The second major data point used to project election results are the results themselves.
358640	363700	A small sampling of results from a county should be roughly representative of the county's
363700	364820	results overall.
364820	369040	The Associated Press stations about 4,000 of its reporters in vote counting centers
369040	373200	all across the country, and as soon as these counties report results, the reporters call
373200	376440	them in to the AP's office in Spokane, Washington.
376440	380620	There, one of hundreds of data entry personnel will answer the phone and put the information
380620	382340	into the AP's system.
382340	386680	These data, which may at the time of entry be unofficial, are used by news organizations
386680	388460	all around the world.
388460	392680	Throughout the night, results will come in precinct by precinct and the AP will call
392680	394980	the results precinct by precinct.
394980	399860	The last polls close at 1 am eastern time in Alaska, however, more than likely, the
399860	403660	country will already know who has won the election by that time.
403660	407200	The AP's DC Bureau is in charge of calling the race.
407200	411440	They'll one by one declare each state one for one candidate or the other.
411440	415240	Some states they'll know from the second polls close which way they'll go.
415240	420720	For example, in 2016, the highly Democratic states of Massachusetts, New Jersey, Delaware,
420720	424920	and Maryland, along with the District of Columbia, were all called for Clinton by the AP the
424920	428560	very minute polls closed in those places at 8 pm eastern.
428560	432660	The AP just knew, off of historical voting trends and exit polling, that they would certainly
432660	433960	go blue.
433960	438840	Meanwhile, battleground states, with a fairly even mix of Democrats and Republicans, tend
438840	443440	to be trickier to call and require a good proportion of actual results to come in.
443440	449040	For example, Minnesota's results in 2016 weren't called until 11.09 am eastern and
449040	453840	Alaska's not until 11.58 am eastern on the day after the election.
453840	458000	Far before the last state is called, though, the combination of electoral votes designated
458000	463500	to the called states will exceed the required majority, 270, and at that time, the AP will
463500	465700	send out what they call a flash.
465700	470620	These are the very highest tier of AP alerts reserved for, as they describe it, events
470620	473940	they expect to be one of the very top stories of the year.
473940	478780	The AP averages less than two flashes a year, and such an alert has been used for events
478780	483220	like the killing of Osama bin Laden, the resignation of Pope Benedict, and the death of Nelson
483220	484220	Mandela.
484220	488840	It is not always the AP who is first to call the race, but more often than not, they are
488840	492280	the first major news organization to declare a winner.
492280	497160	Historically, this tends to happen between 9 and 11 pm eastern, but sometimes much later
497160	498880	and sometimes much earlier.
498880	502920	From there, tradition kicks in and the loser calls the winner, the winner throws a party,
502920	506240	and the next day the sitting president calls the president-elect.
506240	510680	The true, official results might not come in for days or weeks as states work to tally
510680	513320	every vote, not reliant on probability.
513320	518100	The moment that happens, though, the clocks reset, and the US and world again begins the
518100	523500	four-year process leading up to the election of the next American president.
