00:08.440 --> 00:13.460
On November 3rd, 2020, hundreds of millions of Americans will all make their way to their

00:13.460 --> 00:18.400
local polling stations to cast their votes—deciding who will be the next President of the United

00:18.400 --> 00:20.160
States of America.

00:20.160 --> 00:25.160
That day will be the accumulation of a multi-year, multi-billion dollar election process, but

00:25.160 --> 00:30.640
before that all truly ends, the votes need to be counted and the winner has to be declared.

00:30.640 --> 00:35.920
As soon as the first polls close at 6 PM Eastern Time, there begins a massive overnight exercise

00:35.920 --> 00:40.400
to count hundreds of millions of votes and, typically, declare who will next lead the

00:40.400 --> 00:43.080
country by the early hours of the following morning.

00:43.080 --> 00:47.220
While the true effort doesn't start until the early evening of voting day, the first

00:47.220 --> 00:52.040
results come in the early morning of election day, before most polls have even opened.

00:52.040 --> 00:56.280
A few small towns on the East Coast, most famously Dixville Notch, New Hampshire, all

00:56.280 --> 01:00.240
compete to be the first precinct in the US to report results.

01:00.240 --> 01:04.800
New Hampshire state law allows polling places in the state to close early as long as all

01:04.800 --> 01:07.520
registered voters have cast their ballots.

01:07.520 --> 01:11.380
Given that the town only has a dozen or so registered voters, this process is typically

01:11.380 --> 01:13.820
finished in minutes or seconds.

01:13.820 --> 01:18.120
In front of a cluster of cameras from nearly every major news organization, the votes are

01:18.120 --> 01:19.760
read out and tallied.

01:19.760 --> 01:23.840
The process of counting a dozen or so paper ballots in a small town is not tough, but

01:23.840 --> 01:28.320
a few hours later, the rest of the country's polling places will open, each of which eventually

01:28.320 --> 01:32.040
has to accurately count up to thousands of votes.

01:32.040 --> 01:37.680
What makes the US election so difficult to conduct right is that there are over 178,000

01:37.680 --> 01:42.400
individual voting precincts, each of which can and does do things in a slightly different

01:42.400 --> 01:43.400
way.

01:43.400 --> 01:47.000
Some use paper ballots that have to be read and interpreted manually, some use paper ballots

01:47.000 --> 01:51.840
that are scanned by a machine, some use electronic voting machines, and some even allow for absentee

01:51.840 --> 01:53.560
voting over the internet.

01:53.560 --> 01:56.800
The selection of a voting method is a difficult balancing act.

01:56.800 --> 02:00.480
Handwritten paper ballots are simple and cheap, which means that a polling station can process

02:00.480 --> 02:04.960
loads of voters at once, but they're much more difficult to count.

02:04.960 --> 02:08.040
Electronic voting machines are expensive and complicated, meaning they're often in short

02:08.040 --> 02:13.880
supply, leading to longer lines, but counting and reporting the votes happen almost instantaneously.

02:13.880 --> 02:17.340
Also a major concern in the selection of voting method is security.

02:17.340 --> 02:22.400
The most secure ballot is no doubt a handwritten paper one, as submitting a fraudulent vote

02:22.400 --> 02:26.040
involves physically acquiring and submitting a ballot—something that can't be easily

02:26.040 --> 02:27.720
done at a large scale.

02:27.720 --> 02:32.740
Arguably the least secure method is electronic voting machines, as anything electronic can

02:32.740 --> 02:34.200
be hacked.

02:34.200 --> 02:38.120
Almost every voting machine out there has been hacked in some way or another in controlled

02:38.120 --> 02:41.020
experiments at hacker conventions such as Defcon.

02:41.020 --> 02:44.940
In the real world, it's impossible to know for sure how often voting security has been

02:44.940 --> 02:49.900
compromised, but we do know that these machines can be hacked which is why still today much

02:49.900 --> 02:55.020
of the US votes the same way it did hundreds of years ago—on paper ballots.

02:55.020 --> 02:59.520
First to close their polling places will be parts of Indiana and Kentucky at 6 PM Eastern.

02:59.520 --> 03:03.400
The second that happens, everything shifts into counting mode.

03:03.400 --> 03:08.040
Both states use a mix of optical scan and direct record electronic voting machines.

03:08.040 --> 03:12.900
For example, the majority of Kentucky's machines are Hart Intracivic e-scans.

03:12.900 --> 03:16.880
These are those optical scan electronic machines where a voter physically fills out a paper

03:16.880 --> 03:21.160
ballot, shading in bubbles for their preferred candidates, then feeds the sheet into a machine

03:21.160 --> 03:25.160
which scans their responses, and then records and tallies the votes.

03:25.160 --> 03:29.120
In Indiana, however, the majority of their machines are micro-vote infinities which are

03:29.120 --> 03:32.060
examples of direct record electronic machines.

03:32.060 --> 03:35.860
These are fully electronic machines where the voter selects their candidates of choice

03:35.860 --> 03:39.260
on the screen before pressing a button to cast their votes.

03:39.260 --> 03:42.700
Once 6 PM rolls around, though, the machines' voting modes will be turned off, they will

03:42.700 --> 03:46.700
print out a physical paper backup displaying the tally of votes for each candidate, and

03:46.700 --> 03:50.740
the poll workers will remove a sort of memory device that stores the totals.

03:50.740 --> 03:55.780
Every step of this process has to be witnessed by multiple people, usually of different political

03:55.780 --> 03:56.780
parties.

03:56.780 --> 04:00.780
These papers and memory devices are all then packed up in sealed envelopes and gathered

04:00.780 --> 04:01.860
together.

04:01.860 --> 04:05.460
From there, the votes need to make it to a central vote-counting location.

04:05.460 --> 04:10.420
Usually, they're driven there by the county's police to assure there is no interference.

04:10.420 --> 04:12.980
That works in most places, but not all.

04:12.980 --> 04:17.540
For example, anyone who's been in Los Angeles in the early evening, when their polls close,

04:17.540 --> 04:21.540
knows that it would take hours to get a vehicle from Gorman, on the northern end of Los Angeles

04:21.540 --> 04:24.020
County, to Norwalk, where votes are tallied.

04:24.020 --> 04:28.520
Therefore, the county uses helicopters to fly voting records to Norwalk from across

04:28.520 --> 04:32.720
the county, and therefore ends up spending many millions of dollars on each election

04:32.720 --> 04:33.720
day.

04:33.720 --> 04:38.520
Traffic is less of a concern in Indiana and Kentucky, though, and so, not long after 6

04:38.520 --> 04:42.780
PM eastern, votes will start arriving at their central counting locations where all the memory

04:42.780 --> 04:46.800
devices will be plugged in to a tabulating computer that will record the results.

04:46.800 --> 04:50.760
They'll also add in the results from early and absentee voting as well.

04:50.760 --> 04:54.080
Given the electronic nature of this count, when votes have physically arrived at the

04:54.080 --> 04:58.060
site, the process doesn't take long, but throughout it all, it will be observed by

04:58.060 --> 05:01.360
a bipartisan grouping of poll workers and officials.

05:01.360 --> 05:05.760
Of course, the way the world hears about the results of the election is not via the government

05:05.760 --> 05:08.880
itself, but rather through the media.

05:08.880 --> 05:12.760
Almost always, the media tells the public who will win the election before all the votes

05:12.760 --> 05:17.360
have come in, and they make this call based off two key pieces of information.

05:17.360 --> 05:19.720
The first is election day polling.

05:19.720 --> 05:22.000
There are two competing systems of polling.

05:22.000 --> 05:26.080
The first is the Associated Press' vote cast system—a relatively new method where

05:26.080 --> 05:29.960
voters are polled at home via the internet and phone in the days leading up to election

05:29.960 --> 05:36.680
day—and the second is the National Election Pool system used by ABC, CBS, CNN, and NBC.

05:36.680 --> 05:40.780
This system uses the more traditional exit poll method where individuals leaving polling

05:40.780 --> 05:45.660
stations are asked who they voted for in an attempt to gather a representative sample.

05:45.660 --> 05:49.960
Both of these systems give media organizations an idea of how voters are leaning on election

05:49.960 --> 05:53.620
day and help them know where the results are likely to swing.

05:53.620 --> 05:58.640
The second major data point used to project election results are the results themselves.

05:58.640 --> 06:03.700
A small sampling of results from a county should be roughly representative of the county's

06:03.700 --> 06:04.820
results overall.

06:04.820 --> 06:09.040
The Associated Press stations about 4,000 of its reporters in vote counting centers

06:09.040 --> 06:13.200
all across the country, and as soon as these counties report results, the reporters call

06:13.200 --> 06:16.440
them in to the AP's office in Spokane, Washington.

06:16.440 --> 06:20.620
There, one of hundreds of data entry personnel will answer the phone and put the information

06:20.620 --> 06:22.340
into the AP's system.

06:22.340 --> 06:26.680
These data, which may at the time of entry be unofficial, are used by news organizations

06:26.680 --> 06:28.460
all around the world.

06:28.460 --> 06:32.680
Throughout the night, results will come in precinct by precinct and the AP will call

06:32.680 --> 06:34.980
the results precinct by precinct.

06:34.980 --> 06:39.860
The last polls close at 1 am eastern time in Alaska, however, more than likely, the

06:39.860 --> 06:43.660
country will already know who has won the election by that time.

06:43.660 --> 06:47.200
The AP's DC Bureau is in charge of calling the race.

06:47.200 --> 06:51.440
They'll one by one declare each state one for one candidate or the other.

06:51.440 --> 06:55.240
Some states they'll know from the second polls close which way they'll go.

06:55.240 --> 07:00.720
For example, in 2016, the highly Democratic states of Massachusetts, New Jersey, Delaware,

07:00.720 --> 07:04.920
and Maryland, along with the District of Columbia, were all called for Clinton by the AP the

07:04.920 --> 07:08.560
very minute polls closed in those places at 8 pm eastern.

07:08.560 --> 07:12.660
The AP just knew, off of historical voting trends and exit polling, that they would certainly

07:12.660 --> 07:13.960
go blue.

07:13.960 --> 07:18.840
Meanwhile, battleground states, with a fairly even mix of Democrats and Republicans, tend

07:18.840 --> 07:23.440
to be trickier to call and require a good proportion of actual results to come in.

07:23.440 --> 07:29.040
For example, Minnesota's results in 2016 weren't called until 11.09 am eastern and

07:29.040 --> 07:33.840
Alaska's not until 11.58 am eastern on the day after the election.

07:33.840 --> 07:38.000
Far before the last state is called, though, the combination of electoral votes designated

07:38.000 --> 07:43.500
to the called states will exceed the required majority, 270, and at that time, the AP will

07:43.500 --> 07:45.700
send out what they call a flash.

07:45.700 --> 07:50.620
These are the very highest tier of AP alerts reserved for, as they describe it, events

07:50.620 --> 07:53.940
they expect to be one of the very top stories of the year.

07:53.940 --> 07:58.780
The AP averages less than two flashes a year, and such an alert has been used for events

07:58.780 --> 08:03.220
like the killing of Osama bin Laden, the resignation of Pope Benedict, and the death of Nelson

08:03.220 --> 08:04.220
Mandela.

08:04.220 --> 08:08.840
It is not always the AP who is first to call the race, but more often than not, they are

08:08.840 --> 08:12.280
the first major news organization to declare a winner.

08:12.280 --> 08:17.160
Historically, this tends to happen between 9 and 11 pm eastern, but sometimes much later

08:17.160 --> 08:18.880
and sometimes much earlier.

08:18.880 --> 08:22.920
From there, tradition kicks in and the loser calls the winner, the winner throws a party,

08:22.920 --> 08:26.240
and the next day the sitting president calls the president-elect.

08:26.240 --> 08:30.680
The true, official results might not come in for days or weeks as states work to tally

08:30.680 --> 08:33.320
every vote, not reliant on probability.

08:33.320 --> 08:38.100
The moment that happens, though, the clocks reset, and the US and world again begins the

08:38.100 --> 08:43.500
four-year process leading up to the election of the next American president.

08:43.500 --> 08:47.420
When evaluating products I might use, like everyone, I'm always looking for a vote

08:47.420 --> 08:52.540
of confidence and for Dashlane, their 11 million users, their top rating on the App Store,

08:52.540 --> 08:56.100
and their endorsement by the New York Times, Wall Street Journal, Forbes, and more, tells

08:56.100 --> 08:58.820
me that it's a product worth using.

08:58.820 --> 09:03.300
What everyone sees in Dashlane, myself included, is that it's a simple way to make browsing

09:03.300 --> 09:06.800
the internet faster, safer, and more efficient.

09:06.800 --> 09:11.320
Dashlane securely stores things like passwords, addresses, frequent flyer numbers, passport

09:11.320 --> 09:15.280
numbers, and plenty more, and then autofills them when they're needed so that everything

09:15.280 --> 09:16.800
happens faster.

09:16.800 --> 09:22.100
