00:00:08,440 --> 00:00:13,460
On November 3rd, 2020, hundreds of millions of Americans will all make their way to their

4
00:00:13,460 --> 00:00:18,400
local polling stations to cast their votes—deciding who will be the next President of the United

5
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:20,160
States of America.

6
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:25,160
That day will be the accumulation of a multi-year, multi-billion dollar election process, but

7
00:00:25,160 --> 00:00:30,640
before that all truly ends, the votes need to be counted and the winner has to be declared.

8
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:35,920
As soon as the first polls close at 6 PM Eastern Time, there begins a massive overnight exercise

9
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:40,400
to count hundreds of millions of votes and, typically, declare who will next lead the

10
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:43,080
country by the early hours of the following morning.

11
00:00:43,080 --> 00:00:47,220
While the true effort doesn't start until the early evening of voting day, the first

12
00:00:47,220 --> 00:00:52,040
results come in the early morning of election day, before most polls have even opened.

13
00:00:52,040 --> 00:00:56,280
A few small towns on the East Coast, most famously Dixville Notch, New Hampshire, all

14
00:00:56,280 --> 00:01:00,240
compete to be the first precinct in the US to report results.

15
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:04,800
New Hampshire state law allows polling places in the state to close early as long as all

16
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:07,520
registered voters have cast their ballots.

17
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:11,380
Given that the town only has a dozen or so registered voters, this process is typically

18
00:01:11,380 --> 00:01:13,820
finished in minutes or seconds.

19
00:01:13,820 --> 00:01:18,120
In front of a cluster of cameras from nearly every major news organization, the votes are

20
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:19,760
read out and tallied.

21
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:23,840
The process of counting a dozen or so paper ballots in a small town is not tough, but

22
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:28,320
a few hours later, the rest of the country's polling places will open, each of which eventually

23
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:32,040
has to accurately count up to thousands of votes.

24
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:37,680
What makes the US election so difficult to conduct right is that there are over 178,000

25
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:42,400
individual voting precincts, each of which can and does do things in a slightly different

26
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:43,400
way.

27
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:47,000
Some use paper ballots that have to be read and interpreted manually, some use paper ballots

28
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:51,840
that are scanned by a machine, some use electronic voting machines, and some even allow for absentee

29
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:53,560
voting over the internet.

30
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:56,800
The selection of a voting method is a difficult balancing act.

31
00:01:56,800 --> 00:02:00,480
Handwritten paper ballots are simple and cheap, which means that a polling station can process

32
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:04,960
loads of voters at once, but they're much more difficult to count.

33
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:08,040
Electronic voting machines are expensive and complicated, meaning they're often in short

34
00:02:08,040 --> 00:02:13,880
supply, leading to longer lines, but counting and reporting the votes happen almost instantaneously.

35
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:17,340
Also a major concern in the selection of voting method is security.

36
00:02:17,340 --> 00:02:22,400
The most secure ballot is no doubt a handwritten paper one, as submitting a fraudulent vote

37
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:26,040
involves physically acquiring and submitting a ballot—something that can't be easily

38
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:27,720
done at a large scale.

39
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:32,740
Arguably the least secure method is electronic voting machines, as anything electronic can

40
00:02:32,740 --> 00:02:34,200
be hacked.

41
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:38,120
Almost every voting machine out there has been hacked in some way or another in controlled

42
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:41,020
experiments at hacker conventions such as Defcon.

43
00:02:41,020 --> 00:02:44,940
In the real world, it's impossible to know for sure how often voting security has been

44
00:02:44,940 --> 00:02:49,900
compromised, but we do know that these machines can be hacked which is why still today much

45
00:02:49,900 --> 00:02:55,020
of the US votes the same way it did hundreds of years ago—on paper ballots.

46
00:02:55,020 --> 00:02:59,520
First to close their polling places will be parts of Indiana and Kentucky at 6 PM Eastern.

47
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:03,400
The second that happens, everything shifts into counting mode.

48
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:08,040
Both states use a mix of optical scan and direct record electronic voting machines.

49
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:12,900
For example, the majority of Kentucky's machines are Hart Intracivic e-scans.

50
00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:16,880
These are those optical scan electronic machines where a voter physically fills out a paper

51
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:21,160
ballot, shading in bubbles for their preferred candidates, then feeds the sheet into a machine

52
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:25,160
which scans their responses, and then records and tallies the votes.

53
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:29,120
In Indiana, however, the majority of their machines are micro-vote infinities which are

54
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:32,060
examples of direct record electronic machines.

55
00:03:32,060 --> 00:03:35,860
These are fully electronic machines where the voter selects their candidates of choice

56
00:03:35,860 --> 00:03:39,260
on the screen before pressing a button to cast their votes.

57
00:03:39,260 --> 00:03:42,700
Once 6 PM rolls around, though, the machines' voting modes will be turned off, they will

58
00:03:42,700 --> 00:03:46,700
print out a physical paper backup displaying the tally of votes for each candidate, and

59
00:03:46,700 --> 00:03:50,740
the poll workers will remove a sort of memory device that stores the totals.

60
00:03:50,740 --> 00:03:55,780
Every step of this process has to be witnessed by multiple people, usually of different political

61
00:03:55,780 --> 00:03:56,780
parties.

62
00:03:56,780 --> 00:04:00,780
These papers and memory devices are all then packed up in sealed envelopes and gathered

63
00:04:00,780 --> 00:04:01,860
together.

64
00:04:01,860 --> 00:04:05,460
From there, the votes need to make it to a central vote-counting location.

65
00:04:05,460 --> 00:04:10,420
Usually, they're driven there by the county's police to assure there is no interference.

66
00:04:10,420 --> 00:04:12,980
That works in most places, but not all.

67
00:04:12,980 --> 00:04:17,540
For example, anyone who's been in Los Angeles in the early evening, when their polls close,

68
00:04:17,540 --> 00:04:21,540
knows that it would take hours to get a vehicle from Gorman, on the northern end of Los Angeles

69
00:04:21,540 --> 00:04:24,020
County, to Norwalk, where votes are tallied.

70
00:04:24,020 --> 00:04:28,520
Therefore, the county uses helicopters to fly voting records to Norwalk from across

71
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:32,720
the county, and therefore ends up spending many millions of dollars on each election

72
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:33,720
day.

73
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:38,520
Traffic is less of a concern in Indiana and Kentucky, though, and so, not long after 6

74
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:42,780
PM eastern, votes will start arriving at their central counting locations where all the memory

75
00:04:42,780 --> 00:04:46,800
devices will be plugged in to a tabulating computer that will record the results.

76
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:50,760
They'll also add in the results from early and absentee voting as well.

77
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:54,080
Given the electronic nature of this count, when votes have physically arrived at the

78
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:58,060
site, the process doesn't take long, but throughout it all, it will be observed by

79
00:04:58,060 --> 00:05:01,360
a bipartisan grouping of poll workers and officials.

80
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:05,760
Of course, the way the world hears about the results of the election is not via the government

81
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:08,880
itself, but rather through the media.

82
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:12,760
Almost always, the media tells the public who will win the election before all the votes

83
00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:17,360
have come in, and they make this call based off two key pieces of information.

84
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:19,720
The first is election day polling.

85
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:22,000
There are two competing systems of polling.

86
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:26,080
The first is the Associated Press' vote cast system—a relatively new method where

87
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:29,960
voters are polled at home via the internet and phone in the days leading up to election

88
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:36,680
day—and the second is the National Election Pool system used by ABC, CBS, CNN, and NBC.

89
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:40,780
This system uses the more traditional exit poll method where individuals leaving polling

90
00:05:40,780 --> 00:05:45,660
stations are asked who they voted for in an attempt to gather a representative sample.

91
00:05:45,660 --> 00:05:49,960
Both of these systems give media organizations an idea of how voters are leaning on election

92
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:53,620
day and help them know where the results are likely to swing.

93
00:05:53,620 --> 00:05:58,640
The second major data point used to project election results are the results themselves.

94
00:05:58,640 --> 00:06:03,700
A small sampling of results from a county should be roughly representative of the county's

95
00:06:03,700 --> 00:06:04,820
results overall.

96
00:06:04,820 --> 00:06:09,040
The Associated Press stations about 4,000 of its reporters in vote counting centers

97
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:13,200
all across the country, and as soon as these counties report results, the reporters call

98
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:16,440
them in to the AP's office in Spokane, Washington.

99
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:20,620
There, one of hundreds of data entry personnel will answer the phone and put the information

100
00:06:20,620 --> 00:06:22,340
into the AP's system.

101
00:06:22,340 --> 00:06:26,680
These data, which may at the time of entry be unofficial, are used by news organizations

102
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:28,460
all around the world.

103
00:06:28,460 --> 00:06:32,680
Throughout the night, results will come in precinct by precinct and the AP will call

104
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:34,980
the results precinct by precinct.

105
00:06:34,980 --> 00:06:39,860
The last polls close at 1 am eastern time in Alaska, however, more than likely, the

106
00:06:39,860 --> 00:06:43,660
country will already know who has won the election by that time.

107
00:06:43,660 --> 00:06:47,200
The AP's DC Bureau is in charge of calling the race.

108
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:51,440
They'll one by one declare each state one for one candidate or the other.

109
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:55,240
Some states they'll know from the second polls close which way they'll go.

110
00:06:55,240 --> 00:07:00,720
For example, in 2016, the highly Democratic states of Massachusetts, New Jersey, Delaware,

111
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:04,920
and Maryland, along with the District of Columbia, were all called for Clinton by the AP the

112
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:08,560
very minute polls closed in those places at 8 pm eastern.

113
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:12,660
The AP just knew, off of historical voting trends and exit polling, that they would certainly

114
00:07:12,660 --> 00:07:13,960
go blue.

115
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:18,840
Meanwhile, battleground states, with a fairly even mix of Democrats and Republicans, tend

116
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:23,440
to be trickier to call and require a good proportion of actual results to come in.

117
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:29,040
For example, Minnesota's results in 2016 weren't called until 11.09 am eastern and

118
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:33,840
Alaska's not until 11.58 am eastern on the day after the election.

119
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:38,000
Far before the last state is called, though, the combination of electoral votes designated

120
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:43,500
to the called states will exceed the required majority, 270, and at that time, the AP will

121
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:45,700
send out what they call a flash.

122
00:07:45,700 --> 00:07:50,620
These are the very highest tier of AP alerts reserved for, as they describe it, events

123
00:07:50,620 --> 00:07:53,940
they expect to be one of the very top stories of the year.

124
00:07:53,940 --> 00:07:58,780
The AP averages less than two flashes a year, and such an alert has been used for events

125
00:07:58,780 --> 00:08:03,220
like the killing of Osama bin Laden, the resignation of Pope Benedict, and the death of Nelson

126
00:08:03,220 --> 00:08:04,220
Mandela.

127
00:08:04,220 --> 00:08:08,840
It is not always the AP who is first to call the race, but more often than not, they are

128
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:12,280
the first major news organization to declare a winner.

129
00:08:12,280 --> 00:08:17,160
Historically, this tends to happen between 9 and 11 pm eastern, but sometimes much later

130
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:18,880
and sometimes much earlier.

131
00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:22,920
From there, tradition kicks in and the loser calls the winner, the winner throws a party,

132
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:26,240
and the next day the sitting president calls the president-elect.

133
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:30,680
The true, official results might not come in for days or weeks as states work to tally

134
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:33,320
every vote, not reliant on probability.

135
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:38,100
The moment that happens, though, the clocks reset, and the US and world again begins the

136
00:08:38,100 --> 00:08:43,500
four-year process leading up to the election of the next American president.

137
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:47,420
When evaluating products I might use, like everyone, I'm always looking for a vote

138
00:08:47,420 --> 00:08:52,540
of confidence and for Dashlane, their 11 million users, their top rating on the App Store,

139
00:08:52,540 --> 00:08:56,100
and their endorsement by the New York Times, Wall Street Journal, Forbes, and more, tells

140
00:08:56,100 --> 00:08:58,820
me that it's a product worth using.

141
00:08:58,820 --> 00:09:03,300
What everyone sees in Dashlane, myself included, is that it's a simple way to make browsing

142
00:09:03,300 --> 00:09:06,800
the internet faster, safer, and more efficient.

143
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:11,320
Dashlane securely stores things like passwords, addresses, frequent flyer numbers, passport

144
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:15,280
numbers, and plenty more, and then autofills them when they're needed so that everything

145
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:16,800
happens faster.

146
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:22,100
It syncs all this information across devices, no matter if it's Mac, PC, iOS, or Android,

147
00:09:22,100 --> 00:09:24,120
so it's always there when you need it.
