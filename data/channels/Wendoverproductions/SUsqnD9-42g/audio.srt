00:00:04,820 --> 00:00:07,100
in the description.

3
00:00:07,100 --> 00:00:10,020
Embassies are the vessels through which diplomacy is conducted.

4
00:00:10,020 --> 00:00:15,080
They are the physical manifestations of countries abroad and they are crucial tools in the field

5
00:00:15,080 --> 00:00:16,880
of international relations.

6
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:21,260
These can range in size from tiny, like the UK embassy in Mongolia which only has a handful

7
00:00:21,260 --> 00:00:26,140
of staff, to enormous, like the US embassy in Baghdad—a complex physically as large

8
00:00:26,140 --> 00:00:31,780
as the Vatican City which reached a peak of 16,000 staff during the Iraq War.

9
00:00:31,780 --> 00:00:35,580
Big influential countries will have embassies to almost every other country.

10
00:00:35,580 --> 00:00:39,780
The US, for example, has diplomatic missions to every UN recognized country in the world

11
00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:44,220
except Saint Kitts and Nevis, Antigua and Barbuda, Dominica, Saint Lucia, Saint Vincent

12
00:00:44,220 --> 00:00:48,740
and the Grenadines, Grenada, Guinea-Bissau, Iran, Bhutan, and North Korea.

13
00:00:48,740 --> 00:00:53,260
Smaller, less influential countries, on the other hand, might only have a few embassies.

14
00:00:53,260 --> 00:00:58,220
Uvalu, for example, only has diplomatic missions to New Zealand, Fiji, Taiwan, the European

15
00:00:58,220 --> 00:01:01,360
Union in Belgium, and the United Nations in New York.

16
00:01:01,360 --> 00:01:06,340
You see, there are embassies to non-state organizations—namely the UN and EU.

17
00:01:06,340 --> 00:01:09,140
You can even have embassies to agencies of the UN.

18
00:01:09,140 --> 00:01:13,300
There's one US diplomat in Rome with the lengthy title of, United States Ambassador

19
00:01:13,300 --> 00:01:16,700
to the United Nations Agencies for Food and Agriculture.

20
00:01:16,700 --> 00:01:20,800
Even traditionally closed off countries like North Korea have representation abroad.

21
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:26,000
The DPRK has embassies in some quite Western countries like Germany, Sweden, and the UK,

22
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,120
and these three countries also each have embassies in North Korea.

23
00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:33,120
Now, part of the way these embassies can exist in even the most different and opposing of

24
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:37,120
countries is because of how they are codified in international law.

25
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:41,480
Every UN member state except for South Sudan, Palau, and the Solomon Islands has signed

26
00:01:41,480 --> 00:01:44,240
the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations.

27
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:47,600
This sets out a number of laws on how embassies work.

28
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:51,760
Perhaps the most significant and well-known is Article 22—the premises of the mission

29
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:53,240
shall be inviolable.

30
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:57,560
Unless invited by the ambassador or their government, any representative of the host

31
00:01:57,560 --> 00:02:01,680
country's government—be it police officer, government official, member of the military,

32
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:05,080
or even firefighter—cannot enter the embassy.

33
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:09,440
This of course is how Julian Assange stayed in the Ecuadorian Embassy in London for seven

34
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:10,440
years.

35
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:14,960
He entered in 2012 when he was wanted in the UK for extradition to and subsequent arrest

36
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:15,960
in Sweden.

37
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:20,260
Assange stayed in the embassy while his request for Ecuadorian political asylum was reviewed

38
00:02:20,260 --> 00:02:25,480
and, once it was granted, normally the next step would be to go to Ecuador.

39
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:29,020
Outside the embassy, though, waited British police and so he would therefore have been

40
00:02:29,020 --> 00:02:31,160
arrested if he ever left.

41
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:35,600
In the end, though, after seven years inside, it was the British police that arrested Assange

42
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:40,440
as the Ecuadorians decided Assange had overstayed his welcome and invited the police inside.

43
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:44,440
The Vienna Convention also lays out a few other important rules for embassies—the

44
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:48,260
diplomats in the embassy are exempt from all taxes in the host country, the diplomats are

45
00:02:48,260 --> 00:02:52,400
allowed free movement around the host country, an embassy can have diplomatic couriers carrying

46
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:56,520
diplomatic bags which cannot be seized or searched, diplomats are granted diplomatic

47
00:02:56,520 --> 00:03:00,680
immunity, the residences of diplomats are also treated as an extension of the embassy

48
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:04,820
and cannot be entered without permission, diplomats cannot work or earn profit when

49
00:03:04,820 --> 00:03:08,520
in their host country except for with the embassy, and then there are plenty of other

50
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:10,440
even more minor rules.

51
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:15,280
Now, one big misconception about embassies is that this is an embassy.

52
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:19,940
It's not—this is a chancery—the building in which an embassy is located.

53
00:03:19,940 --> 00:03:24,720
The embassy is not the building, it's the group of people that work inside the building.

54
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:28,440
It is the group of workers that represent the country abroad.

55
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:32,360
Another big misconception about embassy buildings is that they are the sovereign territory of

56
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:34,000
the country they represent.

57
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,080
This is not the case.

58
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:40,000
It is also not the case that embassy buildings are in a state of extraterritoriality—that

59
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,400
the laws don't apply there, as would be the case in the United Nations headquarters

60
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:45,640
or on many foreign military bases.

61
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:49,080
In the case of embassy buildings, it's not that the laws of the host country don't

62
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:53,160
apply there, it's just that many of the people that make up the embassy, the diplomats,

63
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:57,920
cannot be prosecuted for violating those laws and those that enforce the law, the police,

64
00:03:57,920 --> 00:03:58,920
can't enter.

65
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:02,940
Now, diplomats almost always follow the rules of their host country as failing to do so

66
00:04:02,940 --> 00:04:06,760
would be unproductive for the very nature of their job, but when they don't, this

67
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:08,840
can have serious implications.

68
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:14,440
As an example, in April, 1984, two students in Tripoli, Libya were hung for publicly opposing

69
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:15,440
Gaddafi.

70
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:19,680
In response, a protest was formed by a major political opposition group outside the Libyan

71
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:21,160
embassy in London.

72
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:25,240
On order from Gaddafi, an individual inside the embassy building fired into the crowd

73
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:27,800
with a machine gun, wounding 11.

74
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:31,680
One of those wounded was Yvonne Fletcher, a young policewoman, who later died in the

75
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:34,020
hospital from her injuries.

76
00:04:34,020 --> 00:04:37,480
Within ten minutes of the shots going off, the embassy building was surrounded by British

77
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:40,200
police, blocking anyone from going in or out.

78
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:43,480
Once it had been confirmed through forensic autopsy that the shots did indeed come from

79
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:46,160
the embassy, negotiations began.

80
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:48,720
The British tried to get permission to enter the embassy building.

81
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:53,800
You see, only some, but not all, of the 30 people in the building were diplomats meaning

82
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:58,540
that some, if they were found to have committed the crime, could be arrested for it.

83
00:04:58,540 --> 00:05:01,680
The Libyans, however, would not grant access.

84
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:05,760
Therefore, after five days of surrounding the embassy, the British severed diplomatic

85
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:10,080
relations with Libya, giving them another week to leave the embassy and country.

86
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:13,680
This, you see, is what countries can do when diplomats misbehave.

87
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:18,000
They can't go into the embassy building, they can't arrest diplomats, but they can

88
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,120
kick them out of their country.

89
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:23,560
After this incident, diplomatic relations between the two countries didn't normalize

90
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:28,880
for decades and, even today, in 2019, the case is still actively under investigation

91
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:32,600
and it's quite possible an arrest could happen in the future.

92
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:36,480
Generally, though, embassies are more concerned with building diplomacy.

93
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:41,160
Typically, but not always, embassies are headed up by an ambassador.

94
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:44,200
Sometimes, though, there are lapses where one goes without an ambassador for a period

95
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:49,360
of time and other times, a country might choose to recall their ambassador as a sign of displeasure.

96
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:52,800
Now, the job of ambassador is tough to define.

97
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:56,640
In the simplest sense, an ambassador is there to represent their country, but what that

98
00:05:56,640 --> 00:06:00,440
entails varies widely from person to person and post to post.

99
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:04,760
There's often a perception that all that ambassadors do is schmooze and boos, but,

100
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:08,940
to be honest, that's part of the job—they're there to build and maintain relationships

101
00:06:08,940 --> 00:06:13,120
with those that can help their country—politically, economically, or otherwise.

102
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:17,940
That's just part of diplomacy, which is what the embassy's job as a whole is.

103
00:06:17,940 --> 00:06:22,280
This can be direct diplomacy, where the ambassador might meet directly with a head of state,

104
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:23,980
or soft diplomacy.

105
00:06:23,980 --> 00:06:28,760
Soft diplomacy can be things like China sending pandas to foreign zoos, the US funding scholarships

106
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:32,920
for foreign students, or France signing up a branch of the Louvre in Abu Dhabi.

107
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:37,060
They are more subtle ways that a nation can curry public favor with another.

108
00:06:37,060 --> 00:06:41,240
On a smaller scale, embassies will often have a portion of staff dedicated to promoting

109
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:44,520
and exhibiting the art and culture of their country in the region.

110
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:49,040
You'll often see embassies financially supporting and sponsoring concerts of their country's

111
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:50,040
music, for example.

112
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:54,680
Now, in addition to these ways of representing one's country, the embassy also represents

113
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:57,360
its homeland through its actual building.

114
00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:01,720
As the public face of one country in another, it's got to look the part.

115
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:06,160
For example, some of the world's most impressive and important embassies are in Washington,

116
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:10,000
DC given that nearly every nation has a diplomatic mission there.

117
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:14,120
The Chinese embassy building was designed by the children of I.M. Pei, a Chinese-American

118
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:18,480
regarded as one of the world's greatest architects, and evokes the same sense of clean,

119
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:22,600
contemporary, grandeur, and opulence common with the greatest buildings back in the People's

120
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:26,200
Republic itself while still adhering to feng shui principles.

121
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:29,780
Just down the street there is the embassy building of the United Arab Emirates—a perhaps

122
00:07:29,780 --> 00:07:34,440
even more opulent structure clearly incorporating aspects of Islamic architecture.

123
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:38,240
This building seems to purposely command a presence with its open sightline from the

124
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:41,300
street allowing one to look in and up.

125
00:07:41,300 --> 00:07:45,480
Then there's this section of the British embassy complex nearby—a structure resembling

126
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:47,580
an old English country manner.

127
00:07:47,580 --> 00:07:51,480
While countries like China and the UAE might be more focused on pushing their modern image

128
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:55,840
as newly wealthy nations, countries like the UK might draw more attention to their long

129
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:57,600
and storied past.

130
00:07:57,600 --> 00:08:02,340
Then there's the whole realm of the architecture of American embassy complexes themselves.

131
00:08:02,340 --> 00:08:06,760
With necessity, after countless attacks on its embassies through history, the architecture

132
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:10,600
and design of American embassy buildings evokes security.

133
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:15,560
Whether it's the one in Berlin, Beijing, Bern, or Bangkok, they all have the look of

134
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:16,560
a compound.

135
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:20,900
They're mostly modern, innovative designs—a conscious choice to associate these values

136
00:08:20,900 --> 00:08:25,900
to the nation's image—but they're still mostly hidden behind tall walls and fences.

137
00:08:25,900 --> 00:08:29,780
There are still some, though, mostly in places where security is less of a concern, reflecting

138
00:08:29,780 --> 00:08:34,080
the earlier architectural style of the US such as the Georgian House of the US Embassy

139
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:38,500
in Canberra, Australia—a building that would look right at place in the American South.

140
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:43,460
But when embassies are in certain places, their buildings can't just be compound style—they

141
00:08:43,460 --> 00:08:45,300
have to be compounds.

142
00:08:45,300 --> 00:08:49,540
As the physical representations of countries, embassies are the clearest targets for those

143
00:08:49,540 --> 00:08:52,260
wishing to send the message to a country.

144
00:08:52,260 --> 00:08:57,100
During wars, though, there is often more work than ever for embassies to do in a country.

145
00:08:57,100 --> 00:09:01,740
This is why, as mentioned earlier, the US Embassy in Baghdad, Iraq ballooned to over

146
00:09:01,740 --> 00:09:04,600
16,000 staff during the Iraq War.

147
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:08,600
The embassy building was built in the Green Zone—a highly fortified area along the Tigris

148
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:10,240
River in Baghdad.

149
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:14,980
This area, guarded by soldiers and walls more than 9 feet or 3 meters tall, was and still

150
00:09:14,980 --> 00:09:18,540
is home to much of the international presence in Baghdad.

151
00:09:18,540 --> 00:09:24,500
That included embassies of countries like the US, UK, and Australia, but also some companies.

152
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:28,400
War is big business, and the Green Zone was home to small field headquarters for many

153
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:33,200
large international engineering, construction, and private military firms contracted to help

154
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:34,260
in the war.

155
00:09:34,260 --> 00:09:38,560
That is to say, the Green Zone was primarily home to a large group of civilians working

156
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:41,780
in Iraq which is why it was so heavily guarded.

157
00:09:41,780 --> 00:09:46,620
Given the security threat, the US Embassy there was built to be entirely self-sufficient—it

158
00:09:46,620 --> 00:09:51,500
has its own generators, its own wells, its own water filtration plant, its own sewage

159
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:56,220
plant, its own fire station, it even has its own internet uplink to circumvent the Iraqi

160
00:09:56,220 --> 00:09:57,220
network.

161
00:09:57,220 --> 00:10:01,360
It has its own phone network, both wired and wireless, which both operate pretty much as

162
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:05,660
if they were in the US—they use the area codes of New York and Virginia.

163
00:10:05,660 --> 00:10:09,980
Unlike in most cities where embassy staff just live in normal housing in the city, this

164
00:10:09,980 --> 00:10:13,540
embassy has its own block of fortified apartments.

165
00:10:13,540 --> 00:10:17,500
Even during the thick of war, the embassy compound had its own swimming pool, tennis

166
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:21,620
courts, fitness center, department store, nail salon, and movie theater.

167
00:10:21,620 --> 00:10:25,900
Topping it off is a helicopter pad—used to get the ambassador and other top diplomats

168
00:10:25,900 --> 00:10:29,620
around the country when they don't want to confront the dangers below.

169
00:10:29,620 --> 00:10:34,220
The diplomats serving as part of the US Embassy in Baghdad do get another perk in addition

170
00:10:34,220 --> 00:10:39,420
to the pool and tennis courts and movie theater and everything else—they get more money.

171
00:10:39,420 --> 00:10:43,420
You see, when working in the US Foreign Service—and it's often similar when working for other

172
00:10:43,420 --> 00:10:47,740
countries' foreign service—you essentially get more money, the more foreign a place you

173
00:10:47,740 --> 00:10:48,740
go.

174
00:10:48,740 --> 00:10:52,500
If you're serving pretty much anywhere in North America, Western Europe, Australasia,

175
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:55,620
and a few other assorted countries, you get no bonus.

176
00:10:55,620 --> 00:10:59,420
If you serve in a place that has an extreme climate, poor quality of healthcare, high

177
00:10:59,420 --> 00:11:03,500
crime, high pollution, or has any other factor that makes it more difficult to live there

178
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:08,340
as a foreigner, you get hardship pay, which is a bonus that ranges anywhere from 5 to

179
00:11:08,340 --> 00:11:09,700
35%.

180
00:11:09,700 --> 00:11:15,260
That 5% rate includes places like Costa Rica, the Bahamas, Malta, and Bulgaria while the

181
00:11:15,260 --> 00:11:21,780
35% rate is reserved for places like the Central African Republic, Somalia, Libya, Syria, Iraq,

182
00:11:21,780 --> 00:11:23,880
Afghanistan, and Pakistan.

183
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:26,820
That rate of hardship pay can also vary within a country.

184
00:11:26,820 --> 00:11:31,700
For example, if you served at the US Consulate in Dubai, you'd only get a 5% bonus while

185
00:11:31,700 --> 00:11:35,220
serving at the US Embassy in Abu Dhabi would get you 10%.

186
00:11:35,220 --> 00:11:39,340
There are also some places that, well, just don't seem all that hard to live in, but

187
00:11:39,340 --> 00:11:44,420
do earn you hardship pay such as Punta Delgado, Portugal, a well-known vacation destination.

188
00:11:44,420 --> 00:11:47,420
This is likely only included because of its isolation.

189
00:11:47,420 --> 00:11:51,260
On top of hardship pay, you can also get an additional bonus if you serve in a place that

190
00:11:51,260 --> 00:11:52,860
is deemed dangerous.

191
00:11:52,860 --> 00:11:58,140
For example, Port-au-Prince, Haiti gets you 15% while places like Tripoli, Damascus, Kabul,

192
00:11:58,140 --> 00:12:04,700
Baghdad, and Juba will get you a 35% bonus so, in a place like Baghdad, you get a 70%

193
00:12:04,700 --> 00:12:08,140
bonus just for the hardship and danger you put yourself through.

194
00:12:08,140 --> 00:12:12,380
This is how they get people to work at even the harshest of postings without forcing them.

195
00:12:12,380 --> 00:12:16,100
On top of these two, there are also some other bonuses based off things like high cost of

196
00:12:16,100 --> 00:12:18,980
living, difficulty in staffing the post, and more.

197
00:12:18,980 --> 00:12:24,800
Now, in the modern age, some have questioned whether embassies still have a purpose.

198
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:29,140
One hundred years ago, they very much had a purpose as communication was difficult,

199
00:12:29,140 --> 00:12:33,280
travel was slow, and countries therefore needed someone on the ground who could speak on their

200
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:36,060
behalf to others at a moment's notice.

201
00:12:36,060 --> 00:12:40,620
Nowadays, though, messages can be relayed instantaneously through a whole host of means

202
00:12:40,620 --> 00:12:42,020
so what's the point?

203
00:12:42,020 --> 00:12:45,720
Well, ambassadors are not messengers.

204
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:47,360
Ambassadors are representatives.

205
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:51,160
They are there not only to work for their country within political systems, but also

206
00:12:51,160 --> 00:12:55,500
to promote it to the public as to increase travel and trade with their country.

207
00:12:55,500 --> 00:13:00,180
Many argue, in fact, that these small, personal relationships of our world's diplomats tying

208
00:13:00,180 --> 00:13:06,660
together countries of hundreds of millions or billions are more important now than ever.

209
00:13:06,660 --> 00:13:10,380
If you want to work in the foreign service, the US State Department has an extensive reading

210
00:13:10,380 --> 00:13:14,260
list of books that will help you get the knowledge you need, no matter which country you're

211
00:13:14,260 --> 00:13:15,260
from.

212
00:13:15,260 --> 00:13:18,780
One book on there that I found quite interesting was, Blink—The Power of Thinking Without

213
00:13:18,780 --> 00:13:20,700
Thinking by Malcolm Gladwell.

214
00:13:20,700 --> 00:13:24,700
The book is all about how the unconscious brain works in making decisions with very

215
00:13:24,700 --> 00:13:25,700
limited info.

216
00:13:25,700 --> 00:13:30,360
Blink, like so many other books, is available as an audiobook on Audible so you can listen

217
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:32,420
to it wherever and whenever.

218
00:13:32,420 --> 00:13:36,900
I find that listening to books helps me fit a lot more in and it helps make things like

219
00:13:36,900 --> 00:13:39,820
cleaning or commuting a lot more fun.

220
00:13:39,820 --> 00:13:45,940
Best of all, you can sign up for free at audible.com slash wendover or text wendover to 500-500

221
00:13:45,940 --> 00:13:50,520
and download Blink or any other audiobook for free in addition to two Audible originals

222
00:13:50,520 --> 00:13:51,740
also for free.

223
00:13:55,700 --> 00:13:57,700
Thank you.
