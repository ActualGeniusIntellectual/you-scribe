7100	10020	Embassies are the vessels through which diplomacy is conducted.
10020	15080	They are the physical manifestations of countries abroad and they are crucial tools in the field
15080	16880	of international relations.
16880	21260	These can range in size from tiny, like the UK embassy in Mongolia which only has a handful
21260	26140	of staff, to enormous, like the US embassy in Baghdad—a complex physically as large
26140	31780	as the Vatican City which reached a peak of 16,000 staff during the Iraq War.
31780	35580	Big influential countries will have embassies to almost every other country.
35580	39780	The US, for example, has diplomatic missions to every UN recognized country in the world
39780	44220	except Saint Kitts and Nevis, Antigua and Barbuda, Dominica, Saint Lucia, Saint Vincent
44220	48740	and the Grenadines, Grenada, Guinea-Bissau, Iran, Bhutan, and North Korea.
48740	53260	Smaller, less influential countries, on the other hand, might only have a few embassies.
53260	58220	Uvalu, for example, only has diplomatic missions to New Zealand, Fiji, Taiwan, the European
58220	61360	Union in Belgium, and the United Nations in New York.
61360	66340	You see, there are embassies to non-state organizations—namely the UN and EU.
66340	69140	You can even have embassies to agencies of the UN.
69140	73300	There's one US diplomat in Rome with the lengthy title of, United States Ambassador
73300	76700	to the United Nations Agencies for Food and Agriculture.
76700	80800	Even traditionally closed off countries like North Korea have representation abroad.
80840	86000	The DPRK has embassies in some quite Western countries like Germany, Sweden, and the UK,
86000	89120	and these three countries also each have embassies in North Korea.
89120	93120	Now, part of the way these embassies can exist in even the most different and opposing of
93120	97120	countries is because of how they are codified in international law.
97120	101480	Every UN member state except for South Sudan, Palau, and the Solomon Islands has signed
101480	104240	the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations.
104240	107600	This sets out a number of laws on how embassies work.
107600	111760	Perhaps the most significant and well-known is Article 22—the premises of the mission
111760	113240	shall be inviolable.
113240	117560	Unless invited by the ambassador or their government, any representative of the host
117560	121680	country's government—be it police officer, government official, member of the military,
121680	125080	or even firefighter—cannot enter the embassy.
125080	129440	This of course is how Julian Assange stayed in the Ecuadorian Embassy in London for seven
129440	130440	years.
130440	134960	He entered in 2012 when he was wanted in the UK for extradition to and subsequent arrest
134960	135960	in Sweden.
135960	140260	Assange stayed in the embassy while his request for Ecuadorian political asylum was reviewed
140260	145480	and, once it was granted, normally the next step would be to go to Ecuador.
145480	149020	Outside the embassy, though, waited British police and so he would therefore have been
149020	151160	arrested if he ever left.
151160	155600	In the end, though, after seven years inside, it was the British police that arrested Assange
155600	160440	as the Ecuadorians decided Assange had overstayed his welcome and invited the police inside.
160440	164440	The Vienna Convention also lays out a few other important rules for embassies—the
164440	168260	diplomats in the embassy are exempt from all taxes in the host country, the diplomats are
168260	172400	allowed free movement around the host country, an embassy can have diplomatic couriers carrying
172400	176520	diplomatic bags which cannot be seized or searched, diplomats are granted diplomatic
176520	180680	immunity, the residences of diplomats are also treated as an extension of the embassy
180680	184820	and cannot be entered without permission, diplomats cannot work or earn profit when
184820	188520	in their host country except for with the embassy, and then there are plenty of other
188520	190440	even more minor rules.
190440	195280	Now, one big misconception about embassies is that this is an embassy.
195280	199940	It's not—this is a chancery—the building in which an embassy is located.
199940	204720	The embassy is not the building, it's the group of people that work inside the building.
204720	208440	It is the group of workers that represent the country abroad.
208440	212360	Another big misconception about embassy buildings is that they are the sovereign territory of
212360	214000	the country they represent.
214000	215080	This is not the case.
215080	220000	It is also not the case that embassy buildings are in a state of extraterritoriality—that
220000	223400	the laws don't apply there, as would be the case in the United Nations headquarters
223400	225640	or on many foreign military bases.
225640	229080	In the case of embassy buildings, it's not that the laws of the host country don't
229080	233160	apply there, it's just that many of the people that make up the embassy, the diplomats,
233160	237920	cannot be prosecuted for violating those laws and those that enforce the law, the police,
237920	238920	can't enter.
238920	242940	Now, diplomats almost always follow the rules of their host country as failing to do so
242940	246760	would be unproductive for the very nature of their job, but when they don't, this
246760	248840	can have serious implications.
248840	254440	As an example, in April, 1984, two students in Tripoli, Libya were hung for publicly opposing
254440	255440	Gaddafi.
255440	259680	In response, a protest was formed by a major political opposition group outside the Libyan
259680	261160	embassy in London.
261160	265240	On order from Gaddafi, an individual inside the embassy building fired into the crowd
265240	267800	with a machine gun, wounding 11.
267800	271680	One of those wounded was Yvonne Fletcher, a young policewoman, who later died in the
271680	274020	hospital from her injuries.
274020	277480	Within ten minutes of the shots going off, the embassy building was surrounded by British
277480	280200	police, blocking anyone from going in or out.
280200	283480	Once it had been confirmed through forensic autopsy that the shots did indeed come from
283480	286160	the embassy, negotiations began.
286160	288720	The British tried to get permission to enter the embassy building.
288720	293800	You see, only some, but not all, of the 30 people in the building were diplomats meaning
293800	298540	that some, if they were found to have committed the crime, could be arrested for it.
298540	301680	The Libyans, however, would not grant access.
301680	305760	Therefore, after five days of surrounding the embassy, the British severed diplomatic
305760	310080	relations with Libya, giving them another week to leave the embassy and country.
310080	313680	This, you see, is what countries can do when diplomats misbehave.
313680	318000	They can't go into the embassy building, they can't arrest diplomats, but they can
318000	320120	kick them out of their country.
320120	323560	After this incident, diplomatic relations between the two countries didn't normalize
323560	328880	for decades and, even today, in 2019, the case is still actively under investigation
328880	332600	and it's quite possible an arrest could happen in the future.
332600	336480	Generally, though, embassies are more concerned with building diplomacy.
336480	341160	Typically, but not always, embassies are headed up by an ambassador.
341160	344200	Sometimes, though, there are lapses where one goes without an ambassador for a period
344200	349360	of time and other times, a country might choose to recall their ambassador as a sign of displeasure.
349360	352800	Now, the job of ambassador is tough to define.
352800	356640	In the simplest sense, an ambassador is there to represent their country, but what that
356640	360440	entails varies widely from person to person and post to post.
360440	364760	There's often a perception that all that ambassadors do is schmooze and boos, but,
364760	368940	to be honest, that's part of the job—they're there to build and maintain relationships
368940	373120	with those that can help their country—politically, economically, or otherwise.
373120	377940	That's just part of diplomacy, which is what the embassy's job as a whole is.
377940	382280	This can be direct diplomacy, where the ambassador might meet directly with a head of state,
382280	383980	or soft diplomacy.
383980	388760	Soft diplomacy can be things like China sending pandas to foreign zoos, the US funding scholarships
388760	392920	for foreign students, or France signing up a branch of the Louvre in Abu Dhabi.
392920	397060	They are more subtle ways that a nation can curry public favor with another.
397060	401240	On a smaller scale, embassies will often have a portion of staff dedicated to promoting
401240	404520	and exhibiting the art and culture of their country in the region.
404520	409040	You'll often see embassies financially supporting and sponsoring concerts of their country's
409040	410040	music, for example.
410040	414680	Now, in addition to these ways of representing one's country, the embassy also represents
414680	417360	its homeland through its actual building.
417360	421720	As the public face of one country in another, it's got to look the part.
421720	426160	For example, some of the world's most impressive and important embassies are in Washington,
426160	430000	DC given that nearly every nation has a diplomatic mission there.
430000	434120	The Chinese embassy building was designed by the children of I.M. Pei, a Chinese-American
434120	438480	regarded as one of the world's greatest architects, and evokes the same sense of clean,
438480	442600	contemporary, grandeur, and opulence common with the greatest buildings back in the People's
442600	446200	Republic itself while still adhering to feng shui principles.
446200	449780	Just down the street there is the embassy building of the United Arab Emirates—a perhaps
449780	454440	even more opulent structure clearly incorporating aspects of Islamic architecture.
454440	458240	This building seems to purposely command a presence with its open sightline from the
458240	461300	street allowing one to look in and up.
461300	465480	Then there's this section of the British embassy complex nearby—a structure resembling
465480	467580	an old English country manner.
467580	471480	While countries like China and the UAE might be more focused on pushing their modern image
471480	475840	as newly wealthy nations, countries like the UK might draw more attention to their long
475840	477600	and storied past.
477600	482340	Then there's the whole realm of the architecture of American embassy complexes themselves.
482340	486760	With necessity, after countless attacks on its embassies through history, the architecture
486760	490600	and design of American embassy buildings evokes security.
490600	495560	Whether it's the one in Berlin, Beijing, Bern, or Bangkok, they all have the look of
495560	496560	a compound.
496560	500900	They're mostly modern, innovative designs—a conscious choice to associate these values
500900	505900	to the nation's image—but they're still mostly hidden behind tall walls and fences.
505900	509780	There are still some, though, mostly in places where security is less of a concern, reflecting
509780	514080	the earlier architectural style of the US such as the Georgian House of the US Embassy
514080	518500	in Canberra, Australia—a building that would look right at place in the American South.
518500	523460	But when embassies are in certain places, their buildings can't just be compound style—they
523460	525300	have to be compounds.
525300	529540	As the physical representations of countries, embassies are the clearest targets for those
529540	532260	wishing to send the message to a country.
532260	537100	During wars, though, there is often more work than ever for embassies to do in a country.
537100	541740	This is why, as mentioned earlier, the US Embassy in Baghdad, Iraq ballooned to over
541740	544600	16,000 staff during the Iraq War.
544600	548600	The embassy building was built in the Green Zone—a highly fortified area along the Tigris
548600	550240	River in Baghdad.
550240	554980	This area, guarded by soldiers and walls more than 9 feet or 3 meters tall, was and still
554980	558540	is home to much of the international presence in Baghdad.
558540	564500	That included embassies of countries like the US, UK, and Australia, but also some companies.
564500	568400	War is big business, and the Green Zone was home to small field headquarters for many
568400	573200	large international engineering, construction, and private military firms contracted to help
573200	574260	in the war.
574260	578560	That is to say, the Green Zone was primarily home to a large group of civilians working
578560	581780	in Iraq which is why it was so heavily guarded.
581780	586620	Given the security threat, the US Embassy there was built to be entirely self-sufficient—it
586620	591500	has its own generators, its own wells, its own water filtration plant, its own sewage
591500	596220	plant, its own fire station, it even has its own internet uplink to circumvent the Iraqi
596220	597220	network.
597220	601360	It has its own phone network, both wired and wireless, which both operate pretty much as
601360	605660	if they were in the US—they use the area codes of New York and Virginia.
605660	609980	Unlike in most cities where embassy staff just live in normal housing in the city, this
609980	613540	embassy has its own block of fortified apartments.
613540	617500	Even during the thick of war, the embassy compound had its own swimming pool, tennis
617500	621620	courts, fitness center, department store, nail salon, and movie theater.
621620	625900	Topping it off is a helicopter pad—used to get the ambassador and other top diplomats
625900	629620	around the country when they don't want to confront the dangers below.
629620	634220	The diplomats serving as part of the US Embassy in Baghdad do get another perk in addition
634220	639420	to the pool and tennis courts and movie theater and everything else—they get more money.
639420	643420	You see, when working in the US Foreign Service—and it's often similar when working for other
643420	647740	countries' foreign service—you essentially get more money, the more foreign a place you
647740	648740	go.
648740	652500	If you're serving pretty much anywhere in North America, Western Europe, Australasia,
652500	655620	and a few other assorted countries, you get no bonus.
655620	659420	If you serve in a place that has an extreme climate, poor quality of healthcare, high
659420	663500	crime, high pollution, or has any other factor that makes it more difficult to live there
663500	668340	as a foreigner, you get hardship pay, which is a bonus that ranges anywhere from 5 to
668340	669700	35%.
669700	675260	That 5% rate includes places like Costa Rica, the Bahamas, Malta, and Bulgaria while the
675260	681780	35% rate is reserved for places like the Central African Republic, Somalia, Libya, Syria, Iraq,
681780	683880	Afghanistan, and Pakistan.
683880	686820	That rate of hardship pay can also vary within a country.
686820	691700	For example, if you served at the US Consulate in Dubai, you'd only get a 5% bonus while
691700	695220	serving at the US Embassy in Abu Dhabi would get you 10%.
695220	699340	There are also some places that, well, just don't seem all that hard to live in, but
699340	704420	do earn you hardship pay such as Punta Delgado, Portugal, a well-known vacation destination.
704420	707420	This is likely only included because of its isolation.
707420	711260	On top of hardship pay, you can also get an additional bonus if you serve in a place that
711260	712860	is deemed dangerous.
712860	718140	For example, Port-au-Prince, Haiti gets you 15% while places like Tripoli, Damascus, Kabul,
718140	724700	Baghdad, and Juba will get you a 35% bonus so, in a place like Baghdad, you get a 70%
724700	728140	bonus just for the hardship and danger you put yourself through.
728140	732380	This is how they get people to work at even the harshest of postings without forcing them.
732380	736100	On top of these two, there are also some other bonuses based off things like high cost of
736100	738980	living, difficulty in staffing the post, and more.
738980	744800	Now, in the modern age, some have questioned whether embassies still have a purpose.
744800	749140	One hundred years ago, they very much had a purpose as communication was difficult,
749140	753280	travel was slow, and countries therefore needed someone on the ground who could speak on their
753280	756060	behalf to others at a moment's notice.
756060	760620	Nowadays, though, messages can be relayed instantaneously through a whole host of means
760620	762020	so what's the point?
762020	765720	Well, ambassadors are not messengers.
765720	767360	Ambassadors are representatives.
767360	771160	They are there not only to work for their country within political systems, but also
771160	775500	to promote it to the public as to increase travel and trade with their country.
775500	780180	Many argue, in fact, that these small, personal relationships of our world's diplomats tying
780180	786660	together countries of hundreds of millions or billions are more important now than ever.
786660	790380	If you want to work in the foreign service, the US State Department has an extensive reading
790380	794260	list of books that will help you get the knowledge you need, no matter which country you're
794260	795260	from.
795260	798780	One book on there that I found quite interesting was, Blink—The Power of Thinking Without
798780	800700	Thinking by Malcolm Gladwell.
800700	804700	The book is all about how the unconscious brain works in making decisions with very
804700	805700	limited info.
805700	810360	Blink, like so many other books, is available as an audiobook on Audible so you can listen
810360	812420	to it wherever and whenever.
812420	816900	I find that listening to books helps me fit a lot more in and it helps make things like
816900	819820	cleaning or commuting a lot more fun.
819820	825940	Best of all, you can sign up for free at audible.com slash wendover or text wendover to 500-500
825940	830520	and download Blink or any other audiobook for free in addition to two Audible originals
830520	831740	also for free.
835700	837700	Thank you.
