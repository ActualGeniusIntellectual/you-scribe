00:04.820 --> 00:07.100
in the description.

00:07.100 --> 00:10.020
Embassies are the vessels through which diplomacy is conducted.

00:10.020 --> 00:15.080
They are the physical manifestations of countries abroad and they are crucial tools in the field

00:15.080 --> 00:16.880
of international relations.

00:16.880 --> 00:21.260
These can range in size from tiny, like the UK embassy in Mongolia which only has a handful

00:21.260 --> 00:26.140
of staff, to enormous, like the US embassy in Baghdad—a complex physically as large

00:26.140 --> 00:31.780
as the Vatican City which reached a peak of 16,000 staff during the Iraq War.

00:31.780 --> 00:35.580
Big influential countries will have embassies to almost every other country.

00:35.580 --> 00:39.780
The US, for example, has diplomatic missions to every UN recognized country in the world

00:39.780 --> 00:44.220
except Saint Kitts and Nevis, Antigua and Barbuda, Dominica, Saint Lucia, Saint Vincent

00:44.220 --> 00:48.740
and the Grenadines, Grenada, Guinea-Bissau, Iran, Bhutan, and North Korea.

00:48.740 --> 00:53.260
Smaller, less influential countries, on the other hand, might only have a few embassies.

00:53.260 --> 00:58.220
Uvalu, for example, only has diplomatic missions to New Zealand, Fiji, Taiwan, the European

00:58.220 --> 01:01.360
Union in Belgium, and the United Nations in New York.

01:01.360 --> 01:06.340
You see, there are embassies to non-state organizations—namely the UN and EU.

01:06.340 --> 01:09.140
You can even have embassies to agencies of the UN.

01:09.140 --> 01:13.300
There's one US diplomat in Rome with the lengthy title of, United States Ambassador

01:13.300 --> 01:16.700
to the United Nations Agencies for Food and Agriculture.

01:16.700 --> 01:20.800
Even traditionally closed off countries like North Korea have representation abroad.

01:20.840 --> 01:26.000
The DPRK has embassies in some quite Western countries like Germany, Sweden, and the UK,

01:26.000 --> 01:29.120
and these three countries also each have embassies in North Korea.

01:29.120 --> 01:33.120
Now, part of the way these embassies can exist in even the most different and opposing of

01:33.120 --> 01:37.120
countries is because of how they are codified in international law.

01:37.120 --> 01:41.480
Every UN member state except for South Sudan, Palau, and the Solomon Islands has signed

01:41.480 --> 01:44.240
the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations.

01:44.240 --> 01:47.600
This sets out a number of laws on how embassies work.

01:47.600 --> 01:51.760
Perhaps the most significant and well-known is Article 22—the premises of the mission

01:51.760 --> 01:53.240
shall be inviolable.

01:53.240 --> 01:57.560
Unless invited by the ambassador or their government, any representative of the host

01:57.560 --> 02:01.680
country's government—be it police officer, government official, member of the military,

02:01.680 --> 02:05.080
or even firefighter—cannot enter the embassy.

02:05.080 --> 02:09.440
This of course is how Julian Assange stayed in the Ecuadorian Embassy in London for seven

02:09.440 --> 02:10.440
years.

02:10.440 --> 02:14.960
He entered in 2012 when he was wanted in the UK for extradition to and subsequent arrest

02:14.960 --> 02:15.960
in Sweden.

02:15.960 --> 02:20.260
Assange stayed in the embassy while his request for Ecuadorian political asylum was reviewed

02:20.260 --> 02:25.480
and, once it was granted, normally the next step would be to go to Ecuador.

02:25.480 --> 02:29.020
Outside the embassy, though, waited British police and so he would therefore have been

02:29.020 --> 02:31.160
arrested if he ever left.

02:31.160 --> 02:35.600
In the end, though, after seven years inside, it was the British police that arrested Assange

02:35.600 --> 02:40.440
as the Ecuadorians decided Assange had overstayed his welcome and invited the police inside.

02:40.440 --> 02:44.440
The Vienna Convention also lays out a few other important rules for embassies—the

02:44.440 --> 02:48.260
diplomats in the embassy are exempt from all taxes in the host country, the diplomats are

02:48.260 --> 02:52.400
allowed free movement around the host country, an embassy can have diplomatic couriers carrying

02:52.400 --> 02:56.520
diplomatic bags which cannot be seized or searched, diplomats are granted diplomatic

02:56.520 --> 03:00.680
immunity, the residences of diplomats are also treated as an extension of the embassy

03:00.680 --> 03:04.820
and cannot be entered without permission, diplomats cannot work or earn profit when

03:04.820 --> 03:08.520
in their host country except for with the embassy, and then there are plenty of other

03:08.520 --> 03:10.440
even more minor rules.

03:10.440 --> 03:15.280
Now, one big misconception about embassies is that this is an embassy.

03:15.280 --> 03:19.940
It's not—this is a chancery—the building in which an embassy is located.

03:19.940 --> 03:24.720
The embassy is not the building, it's the group of people that work inside the building.

03:24.720 --> 03:28.440
It is the group of workers that represent the country abroad.

03:28.440 --> 03:32.360
Another big misconception about embassy buildings is that they are the sovereign territory of

03:32.360 --> 03:34.000
the country they represent.

03:34.000 --> 03:35.080
This is not the case.

03:35.080 --> 03:40.000
It is also not the case that embassy buildings are in a state of extraterritoriality—that

03:40.000 --> 03:43.400
the laws don't apply there, as would be the case in the United Nations headquarters

03:43.400 --> 03:45.640
or on many foreign military bases.

03:45.640 --> 03:49.080
In the case of embassy buildings, it's not that the laws of the host country don't

03:49.080 --> 03:53.160
apply there, it's just that many of the people that make up the embassy, the diplomats,

03:53.160 --> 03:57.920
cannot be prosecuted for violating those laws and those that enforce the law, the police,

03:57.920 --> 03:58.920
can't enter.

03:58.920 --> 04:02.940
Now, diplomats almost always follow the rules of their host country as failing to do so

04:02.940 --> 04:06.760
would be unproductive for the very nature of their job, but when they don't, this

04:06.760 --> 04:08.840
can have serious implications.

04:08.840 --> 04:14.440
As an example, in April, 1984, two students in Tripoli, Libya were hung for publicly opposing

04:14.440 --> 04:15.440
Gaddafi.

04:15.440 --> 04:19.680
In response, a protest was formed by a major political opposition group outside the Libyan

04:19.680 --> 04:21.160
embassy in London.

04:21.160 --> 04:25.240
On order from Gaddafi, an individual inside the embassy building fired into the crowd

04:25.240 --> 04:27.800
with a machine gun, wounding 11.

04:27.800 --> 04:31.680
One of those wounded was Yvonne Fletcher, a young policewoman, who later died in the

04:31.680 --> 04:34.020
hospital from her injuries.

04:34.020 --> 04:37.480
Within ten minutes of the shots going off, the embassy building was surrounded by British

04:37.480 --> 04:40.200
police, blocking anyone from going in or out.

04:40.200 --> 04:43.480
Once it had been confirmed through forensic autopsy that the shots did indeed come from

04:43.480 --> 04:46.160
the embassy, negotiations began.

04:46.160 --> 04:48.720
The British tried to get permission to enter the embassy building.

04:48.720 --> 04:53.800
You see, only some, but not all, of the 30 people in the building were diplomats meaning

04:53.800 --> 04:58.540
that some, if they were found to have committed the crime, could be arrested for it.

04:58.540 --> 05:01.680
The Libyans, however, would not grant access.

05:01.680 --> 05:05.760
Therefore, after five days of surrounding the embassy, the British severed diplomatic

05:05.760 --> 05:10.080
relations with Libya, giving them another week to leave the embassy and country.

05:10.080 --> 05:13.680
This, you see, is what countries can do when diplomats misbehave.

05:13.680 --> 05:18.000
They can't go into the embassy building, they can't arrest diplomats, but they can

05:18.000 --> 05:20.120
kick them out of their country.

05:20.120 --> 05:23.560
After this incident, diplomatic relations between the two countries didn't normalize

05:23.560 --> 05:28.880
for decades and, even today, in 2019, the case is still actively under investigation

05:28.880 --> 05:32.600
and it's quite possible an arrest could happen in the future.

05:32.600 --> 05:36.480
Generally, though, embassies are more concerned with building diplomacy.

05:36.480 --> 05:41.160
Typically, but not always, embassies are headed up by an ambassador.

05:41.160 --> 05:44.200
Sometimes, though, there are lapses where one goes without an ambassador for a period

05:44.200 --> 05:49.360
of time and other times, a country might choose to recall their ambassador as a sign of displeasure.

05:49.360 --> 05:52.800
Now, the job of ambassador is tough to define.

05:52.800 --> 05:56.640
In the simplest sense, an ambassador is there to represent their country, but what that

05:56.640 --> 06:00.440
entails varies widely from person to person and post to post.

06:00.440 --> 06:04.760
There's often a perception that all that ambassadors do is schmooze and boos, but,

06:04.760 --> 06:08.940
to be honest, that's part of the job—they're there to build and maintain relationships

06:08.940 --> 06:13.120
with those that can help their country—politically, economically, or otherwise.

06:13.120 --> 06:17.940
That's just part of diplomacy, which is what the embassy's job as a whole is.

06:17.940 --> 06:22.280
This can be direct diplomacy, where the ambassador might meet directly with a head of state,

06:22.280 --> 06:23.980
or soft diplomacy.

06:23.980 --> 06:28.760
Soft diplomacy can be things like China sending pandas to foreign zoos, the US funding scholarships

06:28.760 --> 06:32.920
for foreign students, or France signing up a branch of the Louvre in Abu Dhabi.

06:32.920 --> 06:37.060
They are more subtle ways that a nation can curry public favor with another.

06:37.060 --> 06:41.240
On a smaller scale, embassies will often have a portion of staff dedicated to promoting

06:41.240 --> 06:44.520
and exhibiting the art and culture of their country in the region.

06:44.520 --> 06:49.040
You'll often see embassies financially supporting and sponsoring concerts of their country's

06:49.040 --> 06:50.040
music, for example.

06:50.040 --> 06:54.680
Now, in addition to these ways of representing one's country, the embassy also represents

06:54.680 --> 06:57.360
its homeland through its actual building.

06:57.360 --> 07:01.720
As the public face of one country in another, it's got to look the part.

07:01.720 --> 07:06.160
For example, some of the world's most impressive and important embassies are in Washington,

07:06.160 --> 07:10.000
DC given that nearly every nation has a diplomatic mission there.

07:10.000 --> 07:14.120
The Chinese embassy building was designed by the children of I.M. Pei, a Chinese-American

07:14.120 --> 07:18.480
regarded as one of the world's greatest architects, and evokes the same sense of clean,

07:18.480 --> 07:22.600
contemporary, grandeur, and opulence common with the greatest buildings back in the People's

07:22.600 --> 07:26.200
Republic itself while still adhering to feng shui principles.

07:26.200 --> 07:29.780
Just down the street there is the embassy building of the United Arab Emirates—a perhaps

07:29.780 --> 07:34.440
even more opulent structure clearly incorporating aspects of Islamic architecture.

07:34.440 --> 07:38.240
This building seems to purposely command a presence with its open sightline from the

07:38.240 --> 07:41.300
street allowing one to look in and up.

07:41.300 --> 07:45.480
Then there's this section of the British embassy complex nearby—a structure resembling

07:45.480 --> 07:47.580
an old English country manner.

07:47.580 --> 07:51.480
While countries like China and the UAE might be more focused on pushing their modern image

07:51.480 --> 07:55.840
as newly wealthy nations, countries like the UK might draw more attention to their long

07:55.840 --> 07:57.600
and storied past.

07:57.600 --> 08:02.340
Then there's the whole realm of the architecture of American embassy complexes themselves.

08:02.340 --> 08:06.760
With necessity, after countless attacks on its embassies through history, the architecture

08:06.760 --> 08:10.600
and design of American embassy buildings evokes security.

08:10.600 --> 08:15.560
Whether it's the one in Berlin, Beijing, Bern, or Bangkok, they all have the look of

08:15.560 --> 08:16.560
a compound.

08:16.560 --> 08:20.900
They're mostly modern, innovative designs—a conscious choice to associate these values

08:20.900 --> 08:25.900
to the nation's image—but they're still mostly hidden behind tall walls and fences.

08:25.900 --> 08:29.780
There are still some, though, mostly in places where security is less of a concern, reflecting

08:29.780 --> 08:34.080
the earlier architectural style of the US such as the Georgian House of the US Embassy

08:34.080 --> 08:38.500
in Canberra, Australia—a building that would look right at place in the American South.

08:38.500 --> 08:43.460
But when embassies are in certain places, their buildings can't just be compound style—they

08:43.460 --> 08:45.300
have to be compounds.

08:45.300 --> 08:49.540
As the physical representations of countries, embassies are the clearest targets for those

08:49.540 --> 08:52.260
wishing to send the message to a country.

08:52.260 --> 08:57.100
During wars, though, there is often more work than ever for embassies to do in a country.

08:57.100 --> 09:01.740
This is why, as mentioned earlier, the US Embassy in Baghdad, Iraq ballooned to over

09:01.740 --> 09:04.600
16,000 staff during the Iraq War.

09:04.600 --> 09:08.600
The embassy building was built in the Green Zone—a highly fortified area along the Tigris

09:08.600 --> 09:10.240
River in Baghdad.

09:10.240 --> 09:14.980
This area, guarded by soldiers and walls more than 9 feet or 3 meters tall, was and still

09:14.980 --> 09:18.540
is home to much of the international presence in Baghdad.

09:18.540 --> 09:24.500
That included embassies of countries like the US, UK, and Australia, but also some companies.

09:24.500 --> 09:28.400
War is big business, and the Green Zone was home to small field headquarters for many

09:28.400 --> 09:33.200
large international engineering, construction, and private military firms contracted to help

09:33.200 --> 09:34.260
in the war.

09:34.260 --> 09:38.560
That is to say, the Green Zone was primarily home to a large group of civilians working

09:38.560 --> 09:41.780
in Iraq which is why it was so heavily guarded.

09:41.780 --> 09:46.620
Given the security threat, the US Embassy there was built to be entirely self-sufficient—it

09:46.620 --> 09:51.500
has its own generators, its own wells, its own water filtration plant, its own sewage

09:51.500 --> 09:56.220
plant, its own fire station, it even has its own internet uplink to circumvent the Iraqi

09:56.220 --> 09:57.220
network.

09:57.220 --> 10:01.360
It has its own phone network, both wired and wireless, which both operate pretty much as

10:01.360 --> 10:05.660
if they were in the US—they use the area codes of New York and Virginia.

10:05.660 --> 10:09.980
Unlike in most cities where embassy staff just live in normal housing in the city, this

10:09.980 --> 10:13.540
embassy has its own block of fortified apartments.

10:13.540 --> 10:17.500
Even during the thick of war, the embassy compound had its own swimming pool, tennis

10:17.500 --> 10:21.620
courts, fitness center, department store, nail salon, and movie theater.

10:21.620 --> 10:25.900
Topping it off is a helicopter pad—used to get the ambassador and other top diplomats

10:25.900 --> 10:29.620
around the country when they don't want to confront the dangers below.

10:29.620 --> 10:34.220
The diplomats serving as part of the US Embassy in Baghdad do get another perk in addition

10:34.220 --> 10:39.420
to the pool and tennis courts and movie theater and everything else—they get more money.

10:39.420 --> 10:43.420
You see, when working in the US Foreign Service—and it's often similar when working for other

10:43.420 --> 10:47.740
countries' foreign service—you essentially get more money, the more foreign a place you

10:47.740 --> 10:48.740
go.

10:48.740 --> 10:52.500
If you're serving pretty much anywhere in North America, Western Europe, Australasia,

10:52.500 --> 10:55.620
and a few other assorted countries, you get no bonus.

10:55.620 --> 10:59.420
If you serve in a place that has an extreme climate, poor quality of healthcare, high

10:59.420 --> 11:03.500
crime, high pollution, or has any other factor that makes it more difficult to live there

11:03.500 --> 11:08.340
as a foreigner, you get hardship pay, which is a bonus that ranges anywhere from 5 to

11:08.340 --> 11:09.700
35%.

11:09.700 --> 11:15.260
That 5% rate includes places like Costa Rica, the Bahamas, Malta, and Bulgaria while the

11:15.260 --> 11:21.780
35% rate is reserved for places like the Central African Republic, Somalia, Libya, Syria, Iraq,

11:21.780 --> 11:23.880
Afghanistan, and Pakistan.

11:23.880 --> 11:26.820
That rate of hardship pay can also vary within a country.

11:26.820 --> 11:31.700
For example, if you served at the US Consulate in Dubai, you'd only get a 5% bonus while

11:31.700 --> 11:35.220
serving at the US Embassy in Abu Dhabi would get you 10%.

11:35.220 --> 11:39.340
There are also some places that, well, just don't seem all that hard to live in, but

11:39.340 --> 11:44.420
do earn you hardship pay such as Punta Delgado, Portugal, a well-known vacation destination.

11:44.420 --> 11:47.420
This is likely only included because of its isolation.

11:47.420 --> 11:51.260
On top of hardship pay, you can also get an additional bonus if you serve in a place that

11:51.260 --> 11:52.860
is deemed dangerous.

11:52.860 --> 11:58.140
For example, Port-au-Prince, Haiti gets you 15% while places like Tripoli, Damascus, Kabul,

11:58.140 --> 12:04.700
Baghdad, and Juba will get you a 35% bonus so, in a place like Baghdad, you get a 70%

12:04.700 --> 12:08.140
bonus just for the hardship and danger you put yourself through.

12:08.140 --> 12:12.380
This is how they get people to work at even the harshest of postings without forcing them.

12:12.380 --> 12:16.100
On top of these two, there are also some other bonuses based off things like high cost of

12:16.100 --> 12:18.980
living, difficulty in staffing the post, and more.

12:18.980 --> 12:24.800
Now, in the modern age, some have questioned whether embassies still have a purpose.

12:24.800 --> 12:29.140
One hundred years ago, they very much had a purpose as communication was difficult,

12:29.140 --> 12:33.280
travel was slow, and countries therefore needed someone on the ground who could speak on their

12:33.280 --> 12:36.060
behalf to others at a moment's notice.

12:36.060 --> 12:40.620
Nowadays, though, messages can be relayed instantaneously through a whole host of means

12:40.620 --> 12:42.020
so what's the point?

12:42.020 --> 12:45.720
Well, ambassadors are not messengers.

12:45.720 --> 12:47.360
Ambassadors are representatives.

12:47.360 --> 12:51.160
They are there not only to work for their country within political systems, but also

12:51.160 --> 12:55.500
to promote it to the public as to increase travel and trade with their country.

12:55.500 --> 13:00.180
Many argue, in fact, that these small, personal relationships of our world's diplomats tying

13:00.180 --> 13:06.660
together countries of hundreds of millions or billions are more important now than ever.

13:06.660 --> 13:10.380
If you want to work in the foreign service, the US State Department has an extensive reading

13:10.380 --> 13:14.260
list of books that will help you get the knowledge you need, no matter which country you're

13:14.260 --> 13:15.260
from.

13:15.260 --> 13:18.780
One book on there that I found quite interesting was, Blink—The Power of Thinking Without

13:18.780 --> 13:20.700
Thinking by Malcolm Gladwell.

13:20.700 --> 13:24.700
The book is all about how the unconscious brain works in making decisions with very

13:24.700 --> 13:25.700
limited info.

13:25.700 --> 13:30.360
Blink, like so many other books, is available as an audiobook on Audible so you can listen

13:30.360 --> 13:32.420
to it wherever and whenever.

13:32.420 --> 13:36.900
I find that listening to books helps me fit a lot more in and it helps make things like

13:36.900 --> 13:39.820
cleaning or commuting a lot more fun.

13:39.820 --> 13:45.940
Best of all, you can sign up for free at audible.com slash wendover or text wendover to 500-500

13:45.940 --> 13:50.520
and download Blink or any other audiobook for free in addition to two Audible originals

13:50.520 --> 13:51.740
also for free.

13:55.700 --> 13:57.700
Thank you.
