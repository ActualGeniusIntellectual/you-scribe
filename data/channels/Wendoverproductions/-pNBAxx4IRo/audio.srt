3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,880
The United States Navy is traditionally known for its military might.

4
00:00:13,880 --> 00:00:19,760
It is, by far, the largest and potentially most capable navy in the world thanks to its

5
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:23,520
innumerable aircraft carriers, destroyers, and submarines.

6
00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:29,200
But, beyond those, and beyond all the cruisers and patrol boats and other combat ships, there

7
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:37,120
are two more that lurk in the shadows of the 490 ship fleet—the USNS Mercy and Comfort.

8
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:40,120
These are America's hospital ships.

9
00:00:40,120 --> 00:00:44,520
Hospital ships are more or less a forgotten relic of a time when wars were far deadlier

10
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:46,680
and the world was far larger.

11
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:51,240
During those times, when fighting a war abroad, just like today, one had to consider where

12
00:00:51,240 --> 00:00:56,200
casualties would go, but unlike today, there were no capabilities to quickly fly injured

13
00:00:56,200 --> 00:00:58,400
personnel away from a battlefield.

14
00:00:58,400 --> 00:01:03,000
One had to treat close to the conflict and for that, the most viable option was often

15
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,960
to bring a hospital ship to the fight.

16
00:01:05,960 --> 00:01:10,000
These ships were once so significant that, when nations came together to write the Geneva

17
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,700
Conventions, defining the rules of war, hospital ships were a significant focus.

18
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:19,080
They specifically denote these as any that specifically and solely work to assist the

19
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:24,640
wounded or sick with the important distinction that they cannot carry any arms or ammunition.

20
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:29,080
These ships also must be painted white with red crosses to identify themselves, but assuming

21
00:01:29,080 --> 00:01:33,280
these requirements are met, they are officially classed as a hospital ship.

22
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:38,000
Those with this classification cannot, under the Geneva Conventions, be attacked or fired

23
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,240
upon.

24
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:43,960
This was all plenty useful at the time the Geneva Conventions were signed, but today,

25
00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:47,920
land-based warfare is increasingly obsolete and it just doesn't make sense to float

26
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:52,840
a hospital to a conflict zone when field hospitals are more capable and medical evacuation is

27
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:53,840
easy.

28
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:58,200
That's why only eight nations' navies still include hospital ships.

29
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:02,720
Most of these are rather small and primarily deployed for humanitarian purposes, but the

30
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:05,640
US's two hospital ships, meanwhile, are massive.

31
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:12,120
They're the size of cruise ships and comparable in capability to the largest land-based hospitals.

32
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:16,560
Each holds 1,000 hospital beds including 80 intensive care beds.

33
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:23,880
In comparison, the entire state of Maine has 1,061 total and 64 ICU beds.

34
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:28,480
To have an entire state's worth of medical facilities available anywhere in the world

35
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:33,480
is an immensely useful strategic power, but not entirely for the purpose of actually treating

36
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:35,200
US soldiers.

37
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:40,080
Within the military, the Comfort and Mercy are officially classified as flexible deterrent

38
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:41,080
options.

39
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:44,560
That's to say, they're an option for show of force.

40
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:49,700
In wartime, sending a ship with capacity for 1,000 patients sends a message that the US

41
00:02:49,700 --> 00:02:53,380
is willing to accept an immense amount of casualties.

42
00:02:53,380 --> 00:02:56,600
That may or may not be true, but the message is there.

43
00:02:56,600 --> 00:03:01,520
In peacetime, parading a hospital ship around the world for humanitarian missions both fosters

44
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:06,520
goodwill for the US military and also shows countries the capabilities of the US's military

45
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:07,780
health system.

46
00:03:07,780 --> 00:03:11,920
The effectiveness of these ships as flexible deterrent options could be debatable, but

47
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:17,160
in the military's mind, this is the purpose behind these ships—they're an option for

48
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:19,280
deterrence or escalation.

49
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:24,760
That's part of the reason why they've seen so little deployment to combat zones—that's

50
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:27,040
just not the primary purpose.

51
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:31,460
Each ship has only seen one deployment primarily treating casualties of war—the Mercy to

52
00:03:31,460 --> 00:03:37,220
Operation Desert Shield and Storm in 1990 and the Comfort to the Iraq War in 2002.

53
00:03:37,220 --> 00:03:41,560
For the rest of their 30-year histories, they have spent their time deployed on humanitarian

54
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:46,280
missions to disasters or impoverished nations, or in reduced operating status at their home

55
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:48,840
ports in San Diego and Norfolk.

56
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:53,620
While during active service the Mercy houses well over 1,000 crew, most of its time is

57
00:03:53,620 --> 00:03:57,220
spent in port, in that reduced operating status.

58
00:03:57,220 --> 00:04:01,560
At such times, the massive ships will house just 70 crew members who will keep it ready

59
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:03,760
to go at a moment's notice.

60
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:07,680
By the nature of their service, expediency of deployment is key.

61
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:11,980
Therefore, they're designed so that they can go from reduced operating status to leaving

62
00:04:11,980 --> 00:04:14,880
San Diego or Norfolk in just five days.

63
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:19,880
But while they can leave quickly, that doesn't mean they can necessarily get to their destination

64
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:20,880
quickly.

65
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:26,600
The Mercy and Comfort are both converted oil tankers that originally launched in 1975 and

66
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:28,280
1976, respectively.

67
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:32,720
Oil tankers are not designed for speed, as it's just not necessary, so the ships can

68
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:37,040
only travel at about 20 miles or 31 kilometers per hour.

69
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:41,880
Compare that to a Nimitz-class aircraft carrier which, at almost twice the size, can travel

70
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:45,320
at 35 miles or 56 kilometers per hour.

71
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:49,940
If there was, say, a disaster in Sri Lanka, it would take five days to get the ship into

72
00:04:49,940 --> 00:04:55,020
full operating status and then 20 to sail all the way to the Indian Ocean.

73
00:04:55,020 --> 00:05:00,060
By that time, nearly a month after the disaster, the trauma phase of medical response would

74
00:05:00,060 --> 00:05:01,600
be largely done.

75
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:05,520
This is likely a reason why a majority of the ship's deployments have been near the

76
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:07,600
US in the Americas.

77
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:12,360
Of those, many have been long-planned humanitarian missions to provide advanced healthcare to

78
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:14,120
areas without it.

79
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:18,680
These are, of course, incredibly impactful for those they serve, but overall, the ships

80
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:22,920
just aren't designed for super-fast response to critical crises.

81
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:28,220
The very size that slows it does, however, have a purpose—beyond just allowing for

82
00:05:28,220 --> 00:05:33,300
a massive capacity, the ships are stable enough that, even when floating, it is possible to

83
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:37,480
conduct most types of surgery in their 12 operating rooms.

84
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:41,740
There are exceptions—the floating platform doesn't allow for open-heart surgery—but

85
00:05:41,740 --> 00:05:47,840
still, the possibility of conducting advanced medical interventions at sea is impressive.

86
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:51,840
There are, however, more issues related to the origins of the ships.

87
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:56,100
You see, hospitals are quite tricky facilities to design.

88
00:05:56,100 --> 00:05:59,860
Small and subtle differences can mean the difference between life and death and so the

89
00:05:59,860 --> 00:06:04,400
accumulated experience of hundreds of years has resulted in explicit knowledge on how

90
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:06,680
hospitals should be built.

91
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:11,280
One of the myriad principles is that movement bottlenecks should be minimized.

92
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:15,460
That leads to features like wide hallways and doors, but it also means that, as much

93
00:06:15,460 --> 00:06:19,360
as possible, the use of elevators should be avoided.

94
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:23,060
The technique to achieve that is, of course, to make hospitals wider.

95
00:06:23,060 --> 00:06:27,540
You want as much as possible on the same floor so that there is as little need as possible

96
00:06:27,540 --> 00:06:31,920
to put patients in elevators when transferring them from one area to the other.

97
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:36,240
If, for example, a patient takes a turn for the worse and needs to be rushed to an operating

98
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:40,680
room, the 90 seconds waiting for and riding the elevator can mean the difference between

99
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:42,220
life and death.

100
00:06:42,220 --> 00:06:46,140
This also has an implication on overall hospital efficiency.

101
00:06:46,140 --> 00:06:51,320
For example, you ideally want radiology rather close to and on the same floor as the emergency

102
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:56,400
room since many patients often need x-ray imaging right when they present to the ER.

103
00:06:56,400 --> 00:07:00,020
The further away it is, the longer it takes to get a patient to and from there, and then

104
00:07:00,020 --> 00:07:03,940
the longer they spend in the ER department overall, and the more beds are needed to serve

105
00:07:03,940 --> 00:07:06,620
the same number of patients in the ER.

106
00:07:06,620 --> 00:07:10,820
These principles are all why hospitals tend to be wide.

107
00:07:10,820 --> 00:07:15,060
Even in places with incredible density and high real estate costs like New York, most

108
00:07:15,060 --> 00:07:17,800
hospitals are wider than they are tall.

109
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:22,340
In all, hospital design is a puzzle where all the elements that patients most commonly

110
00:07:22,340 --> 00:07:27,360
are transferred between need to be as close in travel time to each other.

111
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:31,400
Looking at the outside of the USNS' mercy and comfort, you would think that they would

112
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:36,720
properly follow this principle of width before height, but unfortunately, during their conversion,

113
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:39,840
legacies of their past lives were left behind.

114
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:45,520
You see, tanker ships, on the inside, are not just one big empty hull filled with oil.

115
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:49,680
They were when they first emerged many years ago, but the issue there was that, with a

116
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:55,340
slight tilt forwards, backwards, or to a side, oil would start sloshing to that side,

117
00:07:55,340 --> 00:07:59,700
which leads to more weight on that side, which leads to more tilt, which leads to more oil

118
00:07:59,700 --> 00:08:03,660
sloshing, and so on and so forth until a ship capsized.

119
00:08:03,660 --> 00:08:07,940
That was clearly an issue, but one easily solved by creating bulkheads both laterally

120
00:08:07,940 --> 00:08:11,580
and longitudinally so that oil couldn't slosh around.

121
00:08:11,580 --> 00:08:15,700
The problem, though, is that these were left in the comfort and mercy.

122
00:08:15,700 --> 00:08:19,140
There are no doors between bulkheads on lower floors.

123
00:08:19,140 --> 00:08:23,200
Therefore, if one needs to get a patient from here to here, they have to be brought

124
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:27,560
up an elevator, across the top deck, and back down again.

125
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:32,240
This leads to huge movement issues, making the ship's effectiveness as a hospital more

126
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:33,240
limited.

127
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:37,680
That's just one large example, but there are plenty of other smaller issues with the

128
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:40,600
ship designs that make them less effective than they could be.

129
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:45,200
They are, after all, nearly 50 years old, and the Navy was already starting to plan

130
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:47,500
their retirement decades ago.

131
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:53,040
Their original cost, including both the ship purchase and conversion, was $275 million

132
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:58,560
each, which may seem like a lot, but this is the same Navy that spends billions on single

133
00:08:58,560 --> 00:08:59,560
destroyers.

134
00:08:59,560 --> 00:09:04,680
A couple hundred million is a bargain for a ship of this size and yearly, its operating

135
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:07,960
costs are rather insignificant in the context of the Navy.

136
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:12,640
It's the kind of asset that makes sense to keep around just in case it becomes useful,

137
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:16,800
as it does every once in a while when disaster strikes in the US or abroad, but also one

138
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:20,340
that the US is likely to be unwilling to invest in upgrading.

139
00:09:20,340 --> 00:09:24,700
A dedicated purpose-built hospital ship of this size would be an enormous step up from

140
00:09:24,700 --> 00:09:29,540
these, but when given the choice between a new destroyer or a new hospital ship, the

141
00:09:29,540 --> 00:09:31,260
Navy's going to pick the destroyer.

142
00:09:31,260 --> 00:09:36,180
It's for that reason why the Comfort and Mercy have stayed in service for so long and

143
00:09:36,180 --> 00:09:39,380
why they're likely to stay in service until the last day possible.

144
00:09:39,380 --> 00:09:44,460
They may not be of enormous use in the Navy's eyes, but to the thousands that they treat,

145
00:09:44,460 --> 00:09:49,120
they're a symbol of hope in tough times, and, until they're incapable of helping

146
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:55,540
anyone, they serve a crucial purpose.

147
00:09:55,540 --> 00:09:59,360
Skills aren't only things that help you in work and school—they also can help you

148
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:01,760
have fun or manage stress.

149
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:06,120
Some of the classes available on Skillshare help you do just that—for example, their

150
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:10,320
class on creating the perfect grilled cheese, or selecting the perfect houseplant, or drawing

151
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:11,320
as self-discovery.

152
00:10:11,660 --> 00:10:15,400
These aren't going to help you get a job, but they will help you entertain yourself.

153
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:19,380
Of course Skillshare can also help you with the hard skills, but this goes to demonstrate

154
00:10:19,380 --> 00:10:23,140
that if there's something you want to learn, Skillshare can help you with it.

155
00:10:23,140 --> 00:10:27,140
Skillshare is built for creative, curious people—those that enjoy learning something

156
00:10:27,140 --> 00:10:32,640
new no matter if they're a beginner or expert—and if that sounds like you, then you should absolutely

157
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:33,860
sign up.

158
00:10:33,860 --> 00:10:39,980
By being one of the first 1,000 to go to skl.sh slash wendover9, you'll get two months free

159
00:10:39,980 --> 00:10:44,240
