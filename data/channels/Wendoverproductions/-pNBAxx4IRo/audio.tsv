10000	13880	The United States Navy is traditionally known for its military might.
13880	19760	It is, by far, the largest and potentially most capable navy in the world thanks to its
19760	23520	innumerable aircraft carriers, destroyers, and submarines.
23520	29200	But, beyond those, and beyond all the cruisers and patrol boats and other combat ships, there
29200	37120	are two more that lurk in the shadows of the 490 ship fleet—the USNS Mercy and Comfort.
37120	40120	These are America's hospital ships.
40120	44520	Hospital ships are more or less a forgotten relic of a time when wars were far deadlier
44520	46680	and the world was far larger.
46680	51240	During those times, when fighting a war abroad, just like today, one had to consider where
51240	56200	casualties would go, but unlike today, there were no capabilities to quickly fly injured
56200	58400	personnel away from a battlefield.
58400	63000	One had to treat close to the conflict and for that, the most viable option was often
63000	65960	to bring a hospital ship to the fight.
65960	70000	These ships were once so significant that, when nations came together to write the Geneva
70000	74700	Conventions, defining the rules of war, hospital ships were a significant focus.
74700	79080	They specifically denote these as any that specifically and solely work to assist the
79080	84640	wounded or sick with the important distinction that they cannot carry any arms or ammunition.
84640	89080	These ships also must be painted white with red crosses to identify themselves, but assuming
89080	93280	these requirements are met, they are officially classed as a hospital ship.
93280	98000	Those with this classification cannot, under the Geneva Conventions, be attacked or fired
98000	99240	upon.
99240	103960	This was all plenty useful at the time the Geneva Conventions were signed, but today,
103960	107920	land-based warfare is increasingly obsolete and it just doesn't make sense to float
107920	112840	a hospital to a conflict zone when field hospitals are more capable and medical evacuation is
112840	113840	easy.
113840	118200	That's why only eight nations' navies still include hospital ships.
118200	122720	Most of these are rather small and primarily deployed for humanitarian purposes, but the
122720	125640	US's two hospital ships, meanwhile, are massive.
125640	132120	They're the size of cruise ships and comparable in capability to the largest land-based hospitals.
132120	136560	Each holds 1,000 hospital beds including 80 intensive care beds.
136560	143880	In comparison, the entire state of Maine has 1,061 total and 64 ICU beds.
143880	148480	To have an entire state's worth of medical facilities available anywhere in the world
148480	153480	is an immensely useful strategic power, but not entirely for the purpose of actually treating
153480	155200	US soldiers.
155200	160080	Within the military, the Comfort and Mercy are officially classified as flexible deterrent
160080	161080	options.
161080	164560	That's to say, they're an option for show of force.
164560	169700	In wartime, sending a ship with capacity for 1,000 patients sends a message that the US
169700	173380	is willing to accept an immense amount of casualties.
173380	176600	That may or may not be true, but the message is there.
176600	181520	In peacetime, parading a hospital ship around the world for humanitarian missions both fosters
181520	186520	goodwill for the US military and also shows countries the capabilities of the US's military
186520	187780	health system.
187780	191920	The effectiveness of these ships as flexible deterrent options could be debatable, but
192080	197160	in the military's mind, this is the purpose behind these ships—they're an option for
197160	199280	deterrence or escalation.
199280	204760	That's part of the reason why they've seen so little deployment to combat zones—that's
204760	207040	just not the primary purpose.
207040	211460	Each ship has only seen one deployment primarily treating casualties of war—the Mercy to
211460	217220	Operation Desert Shield and Storm in 1990 and the Comfort to the Iraq War in 2002.
217220	221560	For the rest of their 30-year histories, they have spent their time deployed on humanitarian
222200	226280	missions to disasters or impoverished nations, or in reduced operating status at their home
226280	228840	ports in San Diego and Norfolk.
228840	233620	While during active service the Mercy houses well over 1,000 crew, most of its time is
233620	237220	spent in port, in that reduced operating status.
237220	241560	At such times, the massive ships will house just 70 crew members who will keep it ready
241560	243760	to go at a moment's notice.
243760	247680	By the nature of their service, expediency of deployment is key.
247680	251980	Therefore, they're designed so that they can go from reduced operating status to leaving
251980	254880	San Diego or Norfolk in just five days.
254880	259880	But while they can leave quickly, that doesn't mean they can necessarily get to their destination
259880	260880	quickly.
260880	266600	The Mercy and Comfort are both converted oil tankers that originally launched in 1975 and
266600	268280	1976, respectively.
268280	272720	Oil tankers are not designed for speed, as it's just not necessary, so the ships can
272720	277040	only travel at about 20 miles or 31 kilometers per hour.
277080	281880	Compare that to a Nimitz-class aircraft carrier which, at almost twice the size, can travel
281880	285320	at 35 miles or 56 kilometers per hour.
285320	289940	If there was, say, a disaster in Sri Lanka, it would take five days to get the ship into
289940	295020	full operating status and then 20 to sail all the way to the Indian Ocean.
295020	300060	By that time, nearly a month after the disaster, the trauma phase of medical response would
300060	301600	be largely done.
301600	305520	This is likely a reason why a majority of the ship's deployments have been near the
305520	307600	US in the Americas.
307600	312360	Of those, many have been long-planned humanitarian missions to provide advanced healthcare to
312360	314120	areas without it.
314120	318680	These are, of course, incredibly impactful for those they serve, but overall, the ships
318680	322920	just aren't designed for super-fast response to critical crises.
322920	328220	The very size that slows it does, however, have a purpose—beyond just allowing for
328220	333300	a massive capacity, the ships are stable enough that, even when floating, it is possible to
333300	337480	conduct most types of surgery in their 12 operating rooms.
337480	341740	There are exceptions—the floating platform doesn't allow for open-heart surgery—but
341740	347840	still, the possibility of conducting advanced medical interventions at sea is impressive.
347840	351840	There are, however, more issues related to the origins of the ships.
351840	356100	You see, hospitals are quite tricky facilities to design.
356100	359860	Small and subtle differences can mean the difference between life and death and so the
359860	364400	accumulated experience of hundreds of years has resulted in explicit knowledge on how
364400	366680	hospitals should be built.
366680	371280	One of the myriad principles is that movement bottlenecks should be minimized.
371280	375460	That leads to features like wide hallways and doors, but it also means that, as much
375460	379360	as possible, the use of elevators should be avoided.
379360	383060	The technique to achieve that is, of course, to make hospitals wider.
383060	387540	You want as much as possible on the same floor so that there is as little need as possible
387540	391920	to put patients in elevators when transferring them from one area to the other.
391920	396240	If, for example, a patient takes a turn for the worse and needs to be rushed to an operating
396240	400680	room, the 90 seconds waiting for and riding the elevator can mean the difference between
400680	402220	life and death.
402220	406140	This also has an implication on overall hospital efficiency.
406140	411320	For example, you ideally want radiology rather close to and on the same floor as the emergency
411320	416400	room since many patients often need x-ray imaging right when they present to the ER.
416400	420020	The further away it is, the longer it takes to get a patient to and from there, and then
420020	423940	the longer they spend in the ER department overall, and the more beds are needed to serve
423940	426620	the same number of patients in the ER.
426620	430820	These principles are all why hospitals tend to be wide.
430820	435060	Even in places with incredible density and high real estate costs like New York, most
435060	437800	hospitals are wider than they are tall.
437800	442340	In all, hospital design is a puzzle where all the elements that patients most commonly
442340	447360	are transferred between need to be as close in travel time to each other.
447360	451400	Looking at the outside of the USNS' mercy and comfort, you would think that they would
451400	456720	properly follow this principle of width before height, but unfortunately, during their conversion,
456720	459840	legacies of their past lives were left behind.
459840	465520	You see, tanker ships, on the inside, are not just one big empty hull filled with oil.
465520	469680	They were when they first emerged many years ago, but the issue there was that, with a
469680	475340	slight tilt forwards, backwards, or to a side, oil would start sloshing to that side,
475340	479700	which leads to more weight on that side, which leads to more tilt, which leads to more oil
479700	483660	sloshing, and so on and so forth until a ship capsized.
483660	487940	That was clearly an issue, but one easily solved by creating bulkheads both laterally
487940	491580	and longitudinally so that oil couldn't slosh around.
491580	495700	The problem, though, is that these were left in the comfort and mercy.
495700	499140	There are no doors between bulkheads on lower floors.
499140	503200	Therefore, if one needs to get a patient from here to here, they have to be brought
503200	507560	up an elevator, across the top deck, and back down again.
507560	512240	This leads to huge movement issues, making the ship's effectiveness as a hospital more
512240	513240	limited.
513240	517680	That's just one large example, but there are plenty of other smaller issues with the
517680	520600	ship designs that make them less effective than they could be.
520600	525200	They are, after all, nearly 50 years old, and the Navy was already starting to plan
525200	527500	their retirement decades ago.
527500	533040	Their original cost, including both the ship purchase and conversion, was $275 million
533040	538560	each, which may seem like a lot, but this is the same Navy that spends billions on single
538560	539560	destroyers.
539560	544680	A couple hundred million is a bargain for a ship of this size and yearly, its operating
544680	547960	costs are rather insignificant in the context of the Navy.
547960	552640	It's the kind of asset that makes sense to keep around just in case it becomes useful,
552640	556800	as it does every once in a while when disaster strikes in the US or abroad, but also one
556800	560340	that the US is likely to be unwilling to invest in upgrading.
560340	564700	A dedicated purpose-built hospital ship of this size would be an enormous step up from
564700	569540	these, but when given the choice between a new destroyer or a new hospital ship, the
569540	571260	Navy's going to pick the destroyer.
571260	576180	It's for that reason why the Comfort and Mercy have stayed in service for so long and
576180	579380	why they're likely to stay in service until the last day possible.
579380	584460	They may not be of enormous use in the Navy's eyes, but to the thousands that they treat,
584460	589120	they're a symbol of hope in tough times, and, until they're incapable of helping
589120	595540	anyone, they serve a crucial purpose.
