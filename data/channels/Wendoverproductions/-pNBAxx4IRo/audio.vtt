00:10.000 --> 00:13.880
The United States Navy is traditionally known for its military might.

00:13.880 --> 00:19.760
It is, by far, the largest and potentially most capable navy in the world thanks to its

00:19.760 --> 00:23.520
innumerable aircraft carriers, destroyers, and submarines.

00:23.520 --> 00:29.200
But, beyond those, and beyond all the cruisers and patrol boats and other combat ships, there

00:29.200 --> 00:37.120
are two more that lurk in the shadows of the 490 ship fleet—the USNS Mercy and Comfort.

00:37.120 --> 00:40.120
These are America's hospital ships.

00:40.120 --> 00:44.520
Hospital ships are more or less a forgotten relic of a time when wars were far deadlier

00:44.520 --> 00:46.680
and the world was far larger.

00:46.680 --> 00:51.240
During those times, when fighting a war abroad, just like today, one had to consider where

00:51.240 --> 00:56.200
casualties would go, but unlike today, there were no capabilities to quickly fly injured

00:56.200 --> 00:58.400
personnel away from a battlefield.

00:58.400 --> 01:03.000
One had to treat close to the conflict and for that, the most viable option was often

01:03.000 --> 01:05.960
to bring a hospital ship to the fight.

01:05.960 --> 01:10.000
These ships were once so significant that, when nations came together to write the Geneva

01:10.000 --> 01:14.700
Conventions, defining the rules of war, hospital ships were a significant focus.

01:14.700 --> 01:19.080
They specifically denote these as any that specifically and solely work to assist the

01:19.080 --> 01:24.640
wounded or sick with the important distinction that they cannot carry any arms or ammunition.

01:24.640 --> 01:29.080
These ships also must be painted white with red crosses to identify themselves, but assuming

01:29.080 --> 01:33.280
these requirements are met, they are officially classed as a hospital ship.

01:33.280 --> 01:38.000
Those with this classification cannot, under the Geneva Conventions, be attacked or fired

01:38.000 --> 01:39.240
upon.

01:39.240 --> 01:43.960
This was all plenty useful at the time the Geneva Conventions were signed, but today,

01:43.960 --> 01:47.920
land-based warfare is increasingly obsolete and it just doesn't make sense to float

01:47.920 --> 01:52.840
a hospital to a conflict zone when field hospitals are more capable and medical evacuation is

01:52.840 --> 01:53.840
easy.

01:53.840 --> 01:58.200
That's why only eight nations' navies still include hospital ships.

01:58.200 --> 02:02.720
Most of these are rather small and primarily deployed for humanitarian purposes, but the

02:02.720 --> 02:05.640
US's two hospital ships, meanwhile, are massive.

02:05.640 --> 02:12.120
They're the size of cruise ships and comparable in capability to the largest land-based hospitals.

02:12.120 --> 02:16.560
Each holds 1,000 hospital beds including 80 intensive care beds.

02:16.560 --> 02:23.880
In comparison, the entire state of Maine has 1,061 total and 64 ICU beds.

02:23.880 --> 02:28.480
To have an entire state's worth of medical facilities available anywhere in the world

02:28.480 --> 02:33.480
is an immensely useful strategic power, but not entirely for the purpose of actually treating

02:33.480 --> 02:35.200
US soldiers.

02:35.200 --> 02:40.080
Within the military, the Comfort and Mercy are officially classified as flexible deterrent

02:40.080 --> 02:41.080
options.

02:41.080 --> 02:44.560
That's to say, they're an option for show of force.

02:44.560 --> 02:49.700
In wartime, sending a ship with capacity for 1,000 patients sends a message that the US

02:49.700 --> 02:53.380
is willing to accept an immense amount of casualties.

02:53.380 --> 02:56.600
That may or may not be true, but the message is there.

02:56.600 --> 03:01.520
In peacetime, parading a hospital ship around the world for humanitarian missions both fosters

03:01.520 --> 03:06.520
goodwill for the US military and also shows countries the capabilities of the US's military

03:06.520 --> 03:07.780
health system.

03:07.780 --> 03:11.920
The effectiveness of these ships as flexible deterrent options could be debatable, but

03:12.080 --> 03:17.160
in the military's mind, this is the purpose behind these ships—they're an option for

03:17.160 --> 03:19.280
deterrence or escalation.

03:19.280 --> 03:24.760
That's part of the reason why they've seen so little deployment to combat zones—that's

03:24.760 --> 03:27.040
just not the primary purpose.

03:27.040 --> 03:31.460
Each ship has only seen one deployment primarily treating casualties of war—the Mercy to

03:31.460 --> 03:37.220
Operation Desert Shield and Storm in 1990 and the Comfort to the Iraq War in 2002.

03:37.220 --> 03:41.560
For the rest of their 30-year histories, they have spent their time deployed on humanitarian

03:42.200 --> 03:46.280
missions to disasters or impoverished nations, or in reduced operating status at their home

03:46.280 --> 03:48.840
ports in San Diego and Norfolk.

03:48.840 --> 03:53.620
While during active service the Mercy houses well over 1,000 crew, most of its time is

03:53.620 --> 03:57.220
spent in port, in that reduced operating status.

03:57.220 --> 04:01.560
At such times, the massive ships will house just 70 crew members who will keep it ready

04:01.560 --> 04:03.760
to go at a moment's notice.

04:03.760 --> 04:07.680
By the nature of their service, expediency of deployment is key.

04:07.680 --> 04:11.980
Therefore, they're designed so that they can go from reduced operating status to leaving

04:11.980 --> 04:14.880
San Diego or Norfolk in just five days.

04:14.880 --> 04:19.880
But while they can leave quickly, that doesn't mean they can necessarily get to their destination

04:19.880 --> 04:20.880
quickly.

04:20.880 --> 04:26.600
The Mercy and Comfort are both converted oil tankers that originally launched in 1975 and

04:26.600 --> 04:28.280
1976, respectively.

04:28.280 --> 04:32.720
Oil tankers are not designed for speed, as it's just not necessary, so the ships can

04:32.720 --> 04:37.040
only travel at about 20 miles or 31 kilometers per hour.

04:37.080 --> 04:41.880
Compare that to a Nimitz-class aircraft carrier which, at almost twice the size, can travel

04:41.880 --> 04:45.320
at 35 miles or 56 kilometers per hour.

04:45.320 --> 04:49.940
If there was, say, a disaster in Sri Lanka, it would take five days to get the ship into

04:49.940 --> 04:55.020
full operating status and then 20 to sail all the way to the Indian Ocean.

04:55.020 --> 05:00.060
By that time, nearly a month after the disaster, the trauma phase of medical response would

05:00.060 --> 05:01.600
be largely done.

05:01.600 --> 05:05.520
This is likely a reason why a majority of the ship's deployments have been near the

05:05.520 --> 05:07.600
US in the Americas.

05:07.600 --> 05:12.360
Of those, many have been long-planned humanitarian missions to provide advanced healthcare to

05:12.360 --> 05:14.120
areas without it.

05:14.120 --> 05:18.680
These are, of course, incredibly impactful for those they serve, but overall, the ships

05:18.680 --> 05:22.920
just aren't designed for super-fast response to critical crises.

05:22.920 --> 05:28.220
The very size that slows it does, however, have a purpose—beyond just allowing for

05:28.220 --> 05:33.300
a massive capacity, the ships are stable enough that, even when floating, it is possible to

05:33.300 --> 05:37.480
conduct most types of surgery in their 12 operating rooms.

05:37.480 --> 05:41.740
There are exceptions—the floating platform doesn't allow for open-heart surgery—but

05:41.740 --> 05:47.840
still, the possibility of conducting advanced medical interventions at sea is impressive.

05:47.840 --> 05:51.840
There are, however, more issues related to the origins of the ships.

05:51.840 --> 05:56.100
You see, hospitals are quite tricky facilities to design.

05:56.100 --> 05:59.860
Small and subtle differences can mean the difference between life and death and so the

05:59.860 --> 06:04.400
accumulated experience of hundreds of years has resulted in explicit knowledge on how

06:04.400 --> 06:06.680
hospitals should be built.

06:06.680 --> 06:11.280
One of the myriad principles is that movement bottlenecks should be minimized.

06:11.280 --> 06:15.460
That leads to features like wide hallways and doors, but it also means that, as much

06:15.460 --> 06:19.360
as possible, the use of elevators should be avoided.

06:19.360 --> 06:23.060
The technique to achieve that is, of course, to make hospitals wider.

06:23.060 --> 06:27.540
You want as much as possible on the same floor so that there is as little need as possible

06:27.540 --> 06:31.920
to put patients in elevators when transferring them from one area to the other.

06:31.920 --> 06:36.240
If, for example, a patient takes a turn for the worse and needs to be rushed to an operating

06:36.240 --> 06:40.680
room, the 90 seconds waiting for and riding the elevator can mean the difference between

06:40.680 --> 06:42.220
life and death.

06:42.220 --> 06:46.140
This also has an implication on overall hospital efficiency.

06:46.140 --> 06:51.320
For example, you ideally want radiology rather close to and on the same floor as the emergency

06:51.320 --> 06:56.400
room since many patients often need x-ray imaging right when they present to the ER.

06:56.400 --> 07:00.020
The further away it is, the longer it takes to get a patient to and from there, and then

07:00.020 --> 07:03.940
the longer they spend in the ER department overall, and the more beds are needed to serve

07:03.940 --> 07:06.620
the same number of patients in the ER.

07:06.620 --> 07:10.820
These principles are all why hospitals tend to be wide.

07:10.820 --> 07:15.060
Even in places with incredible density and high real estate costs like New York, most

07:15.060 --> 07:17.800
hospitals are wider than they are tall.

07:17.800 --> 07:22.340
In all, hospital design is a puzzle where all the elements that patients most commonly

07:22.340 --> 07:27.360
are transferred between need to be as close in travel time to each other.

07:27.360 --> 07:31.400
Looking at the outside of the USNS' mercy and comfort, you would think that they would

07:31.400 --> 07:36.720
properly follow this principle of width before height, but unfortunately, during their conversion,

07:36.720 --> 07:39.840
legacies of their past lives were left behind.

07:39.840 --> 07:45.520
You see, tanker ships, on the inside, are not just one big empty hull filled with oil.

07:45.520 --> 07:49.680
They were when they first emerged many years ago, but the issue there was that, with a

07:49.680 --> 07:55.340
slight tilt forwards, backwards, or to a side, oil would start sloshing to that side,

07:55.340 --> 07:59.700
which leads to more weight on that side, which leads to more tilt, which leads to more oil

07:59.700 --> 08:03.660
sloshing, and so on and so forth until a ship capsized.

08:03.660 --> 08:07.940
That was clearly an issue, but one easily solved by creating bulkheads both laterally

08:07.940 --> 08:11.580
and longitudinally so that oil couldn't slosh around.

08:11.580 --> 08:15.700
The problem, though, is that these were left in the comfort and mercy.

08:15.700 --> 08:19.140
There are no doors between bulkheads on lower floors.

08:19.140 --> 08:23.200
Therefore, if one needs to get a patient from here to here, they have to be brought

08:23.200 --> 08:27.560
up an elevator, across the top deck, and back down again.

08:27.560 --> 08:32.240
This leads to huge movement issues, making the ship's effectiveness as a hospital more

08:32.240 --> 08:33.240
limited.

08:33.240 --> 08:37.680
That's just one large example, but there are plenty of other smaller issues with the

08:37.680 --> 08:40.600
ship designs that make them less effective than they could be.

08:40.600 --> 08:45.200
They are, after all, nearly 50 years old, and the Navy was already starting to plan

08:45.200 --> 08:47.500
their retirement decades ago.

08:47.500 --> 08:53.040
Their original cost, including both the ship purchase and conversion, was $275 million

08:53.040 --> 08:58.560
each, which may seem like a lot, but this is the same Navy that spends billions on single

08:58.560 --> 08:59.560
destroyers.

08:59.560 --> 09:04.680
A couple hundred million is a bargain for a ship of this size and yearly, its operating

09:04.680 --> 09:07.960
costs are rather insignificant in the context of the Navy.

09:07.960 --> 09:12.640
It's the kind of asset that makes sense to keep around just in case it becomes useful,

09:12.640 --> 09:16.800
as it does every once in a while when disaster strikes in the US or abroad, but also one

09:16.800 --> 09:20.340
that the US is likely to be unwilling to invest in upgrading.

09:20.340 --> 09:24.700
A dedicated purpose-built hospital ship of this size would be an enormous step up from

09:24.700 --> 09:29.540
these, but when given the choice between a new destroyer or a new hospital ship, the

09:29.540 --> 09:31.260
Navy's going to pick the destroyer.

09:31.260 --> 09:36.180
It's for that reason why the Comfort and Mercy have stayed in service for so long and

09:36.180 --> 09:39.380
why they're likely to stay in service until the last day possible.

09:39.380 --> 09:44.460
They may not be of enormous use in the Navy's eyes, but to the thousands that they treat,

09:44.460 --> 09:49.120
they're a symbol of hope in tough times, and, until they're incapable of helping

09:49.120 --> 09:55.540
anyone, they serve a crucial purpose.

09:55.540 --> 09:59.360
Skills aren't only things that help you in work and school—they also can help you

09:59.360 --> 10:01.760
have fun or manage stress.

10:01.760 --> 10:06.120
Some of the classes available on Skillshare help you do just that—for example, their

10:06.120 --> 10:10.320
class on creating the perfect grilled cheese, or selecting the perfect houseplant, or drawing

10:10.320 --> 10:11.320
as self-discovery.

10:11.660 --> 10:15.400
These aren't going to help you get a job, but they will help you entertain yourself.

10:15.400 --> 10:19.380
Of course Skillshare can also help you with the hard skills, but this goes to demonstrate

10:19.380 --> 10:23.140
that if there's something you want to learn, Skillshare can help you with it.

10:23.140 --> 10:27.140
