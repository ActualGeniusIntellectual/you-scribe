00:10.440 --> 00:13.680
This isn't really the United States.

00:13.680 --> 00:18.120
This map, while it may display the technical, internationally recognized borders of the

00:18.120 --> 00:22.320
country, just is not fully accurate.

00:22.320 --> 00:24.680
It should look more like this.

00:25.160 --> 00:30.300
That's because the 89,000 square miles or 230,000 square kilometers now missing from

00:30.300 --> 00:36.300
this map are filled by 326 Indian reservations, and the Native American tribes that manage

00:36.300 --> 00:40.320
these lands are recognized by the US federal government as sovereigns.

00:40.320 --> 00:47.480
That's to say, while these may not be countries, they are, by most measures, independent, sovereign

00:47.480 --> 00:49.080
nations.

00:49.080 --> 00:54.240
Collectively, reservations account for 2.5% of the US's total landmass, and together

00:54.240 --> 00:59.280
would represent the 12th physically largest state—between Michigan and Minnesota.

00:59.280 --> 01:03.460
Truly the only commonality between each of the reservations is the system through which

01:03.460 --> 01:05.760
they are recognized by the US federal government.

01:05.760 --> 01:10.500
They range dramatically in size, system, and function.

01:10.500 --> 01:14.920
The smallest, for example, is the likely Ranchera in Northern California.

01:14.920 --> 01:20.340
At just 1.32 acres, it's physically similar in size to many suburban home plots, and is

01:20.340 --> 01:23.700
used as the cemetery of the Pitt River tribe.

01:23.700 --> 01:28.620
There are also plenty of larger reservations without any permanent population.

01:28.620 --> 01:32.800
For example, the Antagonon Indian Reservation in Michigan's Upper Peninsula is mainly

01:32.800 --> 01:37.220
used by a branch of the Lake Superior Chippewa Tribe as hunting and fishing land, and the

01:37.220 --> 01:41.300
small Snoqualmie Reservation is almost entirely composed of the tribe's casino.

01:41.300 --> 01:46.700
But of course, a majority of reservations are inhabited by anywhere between one and

01:46.700 --> 01:49.720
174,000 people.

01:49.720 --> 01:55.340
At the upper end of that spectrum, there's the physically largest, most populous, and,

01:55.340 --> 02:01.380
by many measures, most politically developed Indian reservation—the Navajo Nation.

02:01.380 --> 02:06.140
Centered around northeastern Arizona, but passing into Utah and New Mexico as well,

02:06.140 --> 02:10.980
the Navajo Nation is physically larger than 10 US states, and has a population greater

02:10.980 --> 02:14.180
than that of 18 UN-recognized countries.

02:14.200 --> 02:21.320
Now, according to the US, the Navajo Nation is sovereign, but it's certainly not a country.

02:21.320 --> 02:23.320
So what is it?

02:23.320 --> 02:30.520
Now, like all Indian reservations, the story of how the Navajo Nation came to be is complex

02:30.520 --> 02:31.520
and tragic.

02:31.520 --> 02:36.280
Its Diné people have inhabited the southwest since their migration from Arctic America

02:36.280 --> 02:41.800
around the 15th century AD, but the path that directly led to the establishment of the reservation

02:41.820 --> 02:44.820
began with the Long Walk.

02:44.820 --> 02:49.940
After years of conflict between European Americans and the Diné, the US federal government directed

02:49.940 --> 02:54.780
the army to end what was, in their eyes, the Navajo problem.

02:54.780 --> 02:59.000
Soldiers descended on Navajo land, destroying much of their civilization, and one by one

02:59.000 --> 03:04.620
forced bands of Diné to walk 400 miles or 650 kilometers from their homelands to Fort

03:04.620 --> 03:10.500
Sumner in New Mexico, where they were imprisoned on cramped, unproductive land.

03:10.500 --> 03:15.280
Hundreds died during the walk, and thousands more while imprisoned.

03:15.280 --> 03:19.480
After a few years, though, the government recognized that they had made a mistake.

03:19.480 --> 03:23.720
The camp was costly to run due to its low agricultural yields, and they realized the

03:23.720 --> 03:28.360
land from which the Diné had come was not what the US would consider useful for its

03:28.360 --> 03:29.360
settlers.

03:29.360 --> 03:33.700
In exchange for a number of provisions aimed at assimilation, the Navajo and the US signed

03:33.700 --> 03:39.240
the Treaty of Bosque Redondo, ending the internment, and effectively establishing the Navajo's

03:39.240 --> 03:41.900
reservation around their homelands.

03:41.900 --> 03:46.420
Still though, in the decades that followed, the reservation looked little like the nation

03:46.420 --> 03:47.600
of today.

03:47.600 --> 03:53.420
Change accelerated in 1921, though, when the Aztec oil syndicate struck oil one mile south

03:53.420 --> 03:55.980
of the town of Aztec, New Mexico.

03:55.980 --> 04:00.120
This would go on to be developed into the first commercial well in the region, attracting

04:00.120 --> 04:02.860
considerable attention nationwide.

04:02.860 --> 04:07.900
While this first site was outside the reservation, large oil companies soon recognized that there

04:07.900 --> 04:11.200
were almost certainly productive sites within Navajo borders.

04:11.200 --> 04:15.600
US Secretary of the Interior Albert Bacon Fall, who was quite friendly with the oil

04:15.600 --> 04:20.160
and gas industry, and later would become the first presidential cabinet member in history

04:20.160 --> 04:24.520
to go to jail after accepting bribes from the industry, recognized that further oil

04:24.520 --> 04:28.680
and gas development in the region would require the Navajo's system of governance to look

04:28.680 --> 04:30.860
a little more like the US's.

04:30.860 --> 04:35.440
At the time, the reservation was administered through a decentralized, somewhat informal,

04:35.440 --> 04:41.140
traditional form of governance, which made negotiations with big American companies difficult.

04:41.140 --> 04:46.320
Therefore, Fall organized a Navajo Business Council, with three positions filled by three

04:46.320 --> 04:52.380
of his appointees, all of whom were Navajo, but also friends of Fall or the industry.

04:52.380 --> 04:57.100
However, Bureau of Indian Affairs commissioner Charles H. Burke recognized that this was

04:57.100 --> 05:02.380
far from a democratic process—an unelected council making decisions on behalf of all

05:02.380 --> 05:07.640
the Diné people—so he worked to set up an elected tribal council—the new core of

05:07.640 --> 05:10.000
the nation's legislative system.

05:10.000 --> 05:14.740
Still today, that council serves the same purpose, but its establishment snowballed

05:14.740 --> 05:20.460
the Navajo government into something far more formal, sprawling, and western.

05:20.460 --> 05:26.560
The sovereignty of the Navajo Nation is best examined through its capital—Window Rock.

05:26.560 --> 05:31.000
Its streets are lined with the offices of all the agencies and organizations running

05:31.000 --> 05:35.460
the government functions that the Navajo Nation handles itself—the Division of Public

05:35.460 --> 05:39.620
Safety, the Window Rock Police Department, the Office of Community Development, the Navajo

05:39.620 --> 05:44.220
Nation Veterans Administration, the Navajo Housing Authority, the Navajo Nation Telecommunications

05:44.220 --> 05:48.900
and Utility Agency, the Fish and Wildlife Department, the Heritage and Historic Preservation

05:48.900 --> 05:53.260
Office, the Tribal Courts, the Supreme Court, the Office of Vital Records, the Council Chambers,

05:53.260 --> 05:56.900
and the Navajo Nation Office of the President and Vice President.

05:56.920 --> 06:01.920
Many similarly named structures could also be found in county, state, and national capitals

06:01.920 --> 06:06.640
across the US and world, but there are some missing.

06:06.640 --> 06:10.420
Also dotting the landscape of Window Rock are features like a branch of the United States

06:10.420 --> 06:15.920
Postal Service, an office of the Arizona Motor Vehicle Department, Arizona State Route 264

06:15.920 --> 06:20.080
maintained by the Arizona Department of Transportation, and an airport administered and regulated

06:20.080 --> 06:22.200
by the American FAA.

06:22.260 --> 06:27.420
Adding to that, one sees many of the chain services and stores of the United States—AFLAC,

06:27.420 --> 06:34.260
H&R Block, Ace Hardware, Wells Fargo, Chevron, Bank of America, Quality Inn, McDonald's,

06:34.260 --> 06:35.260
and more.

06:35.260 --> 06:39.460
However, there is also a small, unique business landscape.

06:39.460 --> 06:44.020
There are Navajo petroleum gas stations, owned by the Navajo Oil and Gas Company of the same

06:44.020 --> 06:48.300
name, Basha's Diné Market, which, while owned and operated by the region-wide Basha's

06:48.300 --> 06:52.260
brand, is a unique sub-brand carrying goods especially in demand by Diné like Bluebird

06:52.260 --> 06:56.960
Flour and Mutton, and there's the Navajo Times which, while originally ran by the government,

06:56.960 --> 07:00.200
is now a for-profit, financially independent newspaper.

07:00.200 --> 07:06.280
So, the government and economy of the Navajo Nation is an amalgamation of Navajo and American

07:06.280 --> 07:13.460
features, so considering that, can it be considered truly independent?

07:13.460 --> 07:18.400
Independence is defined by a lack of dependence, so the answer to that revolves around their

07:18.400 --> 07:20.600
relationship with the US.

07:20.600 --> 07:25.700
The federal government's official terminology as to what tribal reservations are is quote

07:25.700 --> 07:29.260
domestic, dependent nations.

07:29.260 --> 07:34.100
While that term originates from an 1831 Supreme Court case, it's never used elsewhere to

07:34.100 --> 07:39.620
define what any other geopolitical entity is, either in the US or internationally, so

07:39.620 --> 07:40.620
it's rather ill-defined.

07:41.620 --> 07:47.380
Therefore, for all intents and purposes, domestic dependent nation is essentially interchangeable

07:47.380 --> 07:50.140
with the term Indian Reservation.

07:50.140 --> 07:56.140
While what an American state is is well understood and defined, what an Indian Reservation is

07:56.140 --> 08:01.500
is defined by a patchwork of decisions, guidelines, legislation, and treaties.

08:01.500 --> 08:06.620
For example, the Indian Citizenship Act of 1924 made it so that all remaining indigenous

08:06.620 --> 08:12.260
people living in the US not already a citizen would be granted such status meaning, functionally,

08:12.260 --> 08:17.540
that all those living on tribal nations are obligated to pay taxes to the US federal government,

08:17.540 --> 08:21.740
as the US uniquely taxes on citizenship and not residency.

08:21.740 --> 08:26.820
However, when members of tribes live on tribal land, they do not pay taxes to the states

08:26.820 --> 08:29.580
that that land is also a part of.

08:29.580 --> 08:34.580
Window Rock, for example, is technically part of both Arizona and the Navajo Nation, but

08:34.580 --> 08:37.380
its residents only pay taxes to the latter.

08:37.380 --> 08:42.860
The tribes themselves, and therefore the reservations, do not pay taxes to either state or federal

08:42.860 --> 08:47.100
governments, much like individual American states themselves.

08:47.100 --> 08:52.360
Unlike states, however, tribal nations have something similar to a citizenship system.

08:52.360 --> 08:57.140
Each tribe has the power to define who can become members and what the process of enrollment

08:57.140 --> 08:58.180
looks like.

08:58.180 --> 09:03.020
For example, in the case of the Navajo Nation, members need to be at least one-fourth Diné

09:03.020 --> 09:06.900
by lineage, and not a member of any other tribe.

09:06.900 --> 09:11.820
Building on that, private property is essentially nonexistent on tribal nations—the land is

09:11.820 --> 09:17.060
held in trust by the US federal government, and then managed by the tribal governments.

09:17.060 --> 09:22.360
Therefore, most residents either live in homes rented out by the tribal housing authority,

09:22.360 --> 09:24.780
or in mobile homes on public land.

09:24.780 --> 09:29.140
That's because banks won't give loans to build housing within reservations, as the

09:29.140 --> 09:33.560
land upon which they'd be built is publicly owned, so it'd be impossible to repossess

09:33.560 --> 09:36.060
the homes if payments fell behind.

09:36.060 --> 09:41.380
They will loan for mobile homes, since they can be repossessed more easily, but altogether,

09:41.380 --> 09:46.880
the policy of public land ownership effectively means tribal nations have immigration control.

09:46.880 --> 09:51.060
You can only live in the Navajo Nation, for example, if you qualify for government housing,

09:51.060 --> 09:55.580
and you only qualify for government housing if you're either Diné or working in the

09:55.580 --> 09:56.580
nation.

09:57.500 --> 10:02.340
During the COVID pandemic, the Navajo Nation enacted some of the strictest border restrictions

10:02.340 --> 10:07.300
in the United States—essentially prohibiting access to all non-residents except when passing

10:07.300 --> 10:12.980
through on state highways—and received no strong legal opposition to such action.

10:12.980 --> 10:18.280
So altogether, the Navajo and other tribal nations have a level of power over who can

10:18.280 --> 10:23.540
live and visit their territory that eclipses that of individual US states.

10:23.540 --> 10:28.500
However, there are other ways in which these nations parallel states.

10:28.500 --> 10:32.980
For example, the US federal government instructs its agencies to treat any interaction with

10:32.980 --> 10:36.460
tribal nations as quote, government to government.

10:36.460 --> 10:41.500
Also like states, tribal nations cannot engage in formal relations with foreign governments,

10:41.500 --> 10:47.120
enter into a state of war, or issue currency—all key differentiators between nationhood and

10:47.120 --> 10:48.120
countryhood.

10:48.120 --> 10:54.420
However, somewhat unlike states, the Navajo Nation has this—a Washington office.

10:54.420 --> 10:59.240
This functions somewhat like the offices of different state representatives in DC, however,

10:59.240 --> 11:03.600
the Navajo Nation Washington office is closer to an embassy than these, as it exclusively

11:03.600 --> 11:08.980
serves to represent the nation through non-voting means to the US government and its agencies.

11:08.980 --> 11:13.760
The Navajo Nation wasn't the first to attempt to represent itself in Washington.

11:13.760 --> 11:19.580
In 1995, the Chickasaw Nation, of Oklahoma, appointed Charles W. Blackwell as the first

11:19.580 --> 11:21.540
tribal ambassador to the US.

11:21.540 --> 11:27.020
In addition, they opened, what they called, a Chickasaw Nation Embassy in DC.

11:27.020 --> 11:31.740
Now, neither the ambassador nor the embassy had the diplomatic protections of those of

11:31.740 --> 11:36.420
foreign nations, so it's unclear how legitimate they were, but there were no challenges to

11:36.420 --> 11:39.720
the nation setting up such a representative system.

11:39.720 --> 11:44.320
The Cherokee Nation, also of Oklahoma, is now going a step further, as they believe

11:44.320 --> 11:48.760
that they have a legal right to formal representation in Washington.

11:48.760 --> 11:54.420
An 1835 treaty with the US gave the Cherokee Nation the power to send a non-voting representative

11:54.420 --> 12:00.340
to the US Congress—similar to those appointed by the District of Columbia and US territories.

12:00.340 --> 12:05.600
Until 2019, the Cherokee never appointed such a representative, but now decided to exercise

12:05.600 --> 12:09.060
their rights when they appointed Kimberly Teehee to fill the position.

12:09.060 --> 12:15.000
However, as of June 2021, she has yet to be ceded by Congress, meaning her power is

12:15.000 --> 12:17.500
not yet formalized.

12:17.500 --> 12:21.660
While it appears the nation has every legal right to take such action, it's a potentially

12:21.660 --> 12:27.100
messy situation, as the people of the Cherokee tribe already have representation in Congress.

12:27.100 --> 12:32.220
While DC and the territories do not receive voting congressional representation, the Cherokee

12:32.220 --> 12:38.180
do as they live in Oklahoma, which, as a state, has voting members in Congress.

12:38.180 --> 12:42.060
Having people represented twice in Congress would be unprecedented.

12:42.060 --> 12:47.580
It's unclear as of now whether Teehee will be ceded, but the reality is that this situation

12:47.580 --> 12:53.100
is like many involving tribal powers in the US—they don't know what they can do until

12:53.100 --> 12:54.100
they try.

12:54.100 --> 12:59.660
In fact, that was exactly what happened in the 1970s when Russell and Helen Bryan, of

12:59.660 --> 13:04.900
the Chippewa Nation, received a property tax bill for around $200 from a county government

13:04.900 --> 13:07.920
despite the fact that they were living on tribal land.

13:07.920 --> 13:11.520
Having never received such a bill before, and not believing they were required to pay

13:11.520 --> 13:15.600
it, they brought it to a local lawyer, who brought their case to the state courts.

13:15.600 --> 13:19.840
They lost that case, and they then lost their appeal in the Minnesota Supreme Court, but

13:19.840 --> 13:23.480
then they brought it to the United States Supreme Court.

13:23.480 --> 13:27.760
Their decision said that not only do states lack the power to tax tribal members on their

13:27.760 --> 13:32.420
reservations, but that states don't have the power to regulate any tribal activity

13:32.420 --> 13:34.160
on their nations.

13:34.160 --> 13:40.040
This was huge, and ideas soon arose as to how to profit from this decision.

13:40.040 --> 13:45.520
Quite quickly, small-scale gambling operations sprung up on reservations, and within years,

13:45.520 --> 13:47.960
large tribal casinos started opening.

13:47.960 --> 13:53.600
Today, these casinos generate tens of billions of dollars in revenue for tribal nations annually,

13:53.600 --> 13:57.760
especially for those lucky enough to be located near major metro areas where gambling is illegal,

13:57.760 --> 14:02.540
such as the Chippewa Nation, which operates the largest casino in America, just 90 minutes

14:02.540 --> 14:03.720
from Dallas.

14:03.720 --> 14:08.700
Others, such as the Navajo Nation, are less lucky.

14:08.700 --> 14:13.960
Located far from economic opportunity, their unemployment rate is 49%, their average household

14:13.960 --> 14:21.400
income is $8,000, their poverty rate is 36%, and one third of their households lack access

14:21.400 --> 14:23.360
to running water.

14:23.360 --> 14:28.320
Tribal reservations in the US exist in a sort of in-between state.

14:28.320 --> 14:32.200
Some sovereign powers are greater than those of states, but they lack the true level of

14:32.200 --> 14:35.160
self-determination reserved for countries.

14:35.160 --> 14:39.680
However, being in such a lonely club, these reservations don't receive the attention

14:39.680 --> 14:45.040
necessary to reform a system that, in many cases, works against them.

14:45.040 --> 14:49.340
For example, the system of public ownership of land means that it's essentially impossible

14:49.340 --> 14:53.140
for those living on reservations to own their own home.

14:53.140 --> 14:57.240
That means they can't build up wealth through home ownership and pass it on to the next

14:57.240 --> 14:58.980
generation.

14:58.980 --> 15:04.020
Others are located in some of the most rural areas of the US, in places already experiencing

15:04.020 --> 15:10.400
the effects of deep rural-urban economic divide, but being isolated from the system of states,

15:10.400 --> 15:14.560
and ignored by the federal government due to their political irrelevance, they perpetually

15:14.560 --> 15:18.860
fall into the category of not my problem.

15:18.860 --> 15:23.920
While there is opportunity in sovereignty, it cannot be realized without trying, and

15:23.920 --> 15:29.040
trying new things is effectively impossible for places so deeply entrenched in a cycle

15:29.040 --> 15:30.160
of poverty.

15:30.160 --> 15:35.920
So, the answer to what the Navajo Nation, or any Native American reservation is, is

15:35.920 --> 15:37.320
that nobody knows.

15:37.320 --> 15:42.400
They're what the federal government lets them be, and so far, there hasn't been enough

15:42.400 --> 15:47.240
time or money for them to explore their boundaries.

15:47.240 --> 15:51.360
So, just over a year ago, I realized something.

15:51.360 --> 15:54.960
I had become a take-out and delivery addict.

15:54.960 --> 15:58.800
Being a busy person, by the time I got to dinner every day, I was tired and ready to

15:58.800 --> 16:03.800
just relax, so I would default to the easiest, most convenient option for food.

16:03.800 --> 16:09.200
However, eventually I realized the huge downsides of take-out and delivery—it's incredibly

16:09.200 --> 16:13.520
expensive when done regularly, and generally just not very healthy.

16:13.520 --> 16:16.420
So, I switched to HelloFresh.

16:16.420 --> 16:20.440
This is all completely true, and I have hundreds of their recipe carts to prove it, as I've

16:20.440 --> 16:23.000
now used them regularly for just over a year.

16:23.000 --> 16:27.500
So, a few months ago, I asked them to sponsor the channel, and now they have.

16:27.500 --> 16:31.600
Every week, a new HelloFresh box arrives on my doorstep, filled with pre-proportioned

16:31.600 --> 16:36.180
ingredients for each meal I picked from the dozens of choices they have each week.

16:36.180 --> 16:40.740
For example, this week I made one of my favorites—the firecracker meatballs.

16:40.740 --> 16:44.400
Since their meals come with the right ingredients in the right amounts, they only take about

16:44.400 --> 16:48.800
30 minutes to make, and you don't have to make long, exhausting trips to grocery stores.

16:48.800 --> 16:52.880
Also, since you're only getting the amounts you actually need, HelloFresh helps cut down

16:52.880 --> 16:57.760
on food waste, and their carbon footprint is about 25% lower than that of store-bought

16:57.760 --> 16:58.760
meals.

16:58.760 --> 17:03.280
Altogether, HelloFresh just makes my dinner a much more enjoyable experience, so find

17:03.280 --> 17:05.860
out why I've been using them for over a year.

17:05.860 --> 17:12.000
