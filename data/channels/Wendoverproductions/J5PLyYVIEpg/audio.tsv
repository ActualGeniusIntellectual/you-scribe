10440	13680	This isn't really the United States.
13680	18120	This map, while it may display the technical, internationally recognized borders of the
18120	22320	country, just is not fully accurate.
22320	24680	It should look more like this.
25160	30300	That's because the 89,000 square miles or 230,000 square kilometers now missing from
30300	36300	this map are filled by 326 Indian reservations, and the Native American tribes that manage
36300	40320	these lands are recognized by the US federal government as sovereigns.
40320	47480	That's to say, while these may not be countries, they are, by most measures, independent, sovereign
47480	49080	nations.
49080	54240	Collectively, reservations account for 2.5% of the US's total landmass, and together
54240	59280	would represent the 12th physically largest state—between Michigan and Minnesota.
59280	63460	Truly the only commonality between each of the reservations is the system through which
63460	65760	they are recognized by the US federal government.
65760	70500	They range dramatically in size, system, and function.
70500	74920	The smallest, for example, is the likely Ranchera in Northern California.
74920	80340	At just 1.32 acres, it's physically similar in size to many suburban home plots, and is
80340	83700	used as the cemetery of the Pitt River tribe.
83700	88620	There are also plenty of larger reservations without any permanent population.
88620	92800	For example, the Antagonon Indian Reservation in Michigan's Upper Peninsula is mainly
92800	97220	used by a branch of the Lake Superior Chippewa Tribe as hunting and fishing land, and the
97220	101300	small Snoqualmie Reservation is almost entirely composed of the tribe's casino.
101300	106700	But of course, a majority of reservations are inhabited by anywhere between one and
106700	109720	174,000 people.
109720	115340	At the upper end of that spectrum, there's the physically largest, most populous, and,
115340	121380	by many measures, most politically developed Indian reservation—the Navajo Nation.
121380	126140	Centered around northeastern Arizona, but passing into Utah and New Mexico as well,
126140	130980	the Navajo Nation is physically larger than 10 US states, and has a population greater
130980	134180	than that of 18 UN-recognized countries.
134200	141320	Now, according to the US, the Navajo Nation is sovereign, but it's certainly not a country.
141320	143320	So what is it?
143320	150520	Now, like all Indian reservations, the story of how the Navajo Nation came to be is complex
150520	151520	and tragic.
151520	156280	Its Diné people have inhabited the southwest since their migration from Arctic America
156280	161800	around the 15th century AD, but the path that directly led to the establishment of the reservation
161820	164820	began with the Long Walk.
164820	169940	After years of conflict between European Americans and the Diné, the US federal government directed
169940	174780	the army to end what was, in their eyes, the Navajo problem.
174780	179000	Soldiers descended on Navajo land, destroying much of their civilization, and one by one
179000	184620	forced bands of Diné to walk 400 miles or 650 kilometers from their homelands to Fort
184620	190500	Sumner in New Mexico, where they were imprisoned on cramped, unproductive land.
190500	195280	Hundreds died during the walk, and thousands more while imprisoned.
195280	199480	After a few years, though, the government recognized that they had made a mistake.
199480	203720	The camp was costly to run due to its low agricultural yields, and they realized the
203720	208360	land from which the Diné had come was not what the US would consider useful for its
208360	209360	settlers.
209360	213700	In exchange for a number of provisions aimed at assimilation, the Navajo and the US signed
213700	219240	the Treaty of Bosque Redondo, ending the internment, and effectively establishing the Navajo's
219240	221900	reservation around their homelands.
221900	226420	Still though, in the decades that followed, the reservation looked little like the nation
226420	227600	of today.
227600	233420	Change accelerated in 1921, though, when the Aztec oil syndicate struck oil one mile south
233420	235980	of the town of Aztec, New Mexico.
235980	240120	This would go on to be developed into the first commercial well in the region, attracting
240120	242860	considerable attention nationwide.
242860	247900	While this first site was outside the reservation, large oil companies soon recognized that there
247900	251200	were almost certainly productive sites within Navajo borders.
251200	255600	US Secretary of the Interior Albert Bacon Fall, who was quite friendly with the oil
255600	260160	and gas industry, and later would become the first presidential cabinet member in history
260160	264520	to go to jail after accepting bribes from the industry, recognized that further oil
264520	268680	and gas development in the region would require the Navajo's system of governance to look
268680	270860	a little more like the US's.
270860	275440	At the time, the reservation was administered through a decentralized, somewhat informal,
275440	281140	traditional form of governance, which made negotiations with big American companies difficult.
281140	286320	Therefore, Fall organized a Navajo Business Council, with three positions filled by three
286320	292380	of his appointees, all of whom were Navajo, but also friends of Fall or the industry.
292380	297100	However, Bureau of Indian Affairs commissioner Charles H. Burke recognized that this was
297100	302380	far from a democratic process—an unelected council making decisions on behalf of all
302380	307640	the Diné people—so he worked to set up an elected tribal council—the new core of
307640	310000	the nation's legislative system.
310000	314740	Still today, that council serves the same purpose, but its establishment snowballed
314740	320460	the Navajo government into something far more formal, sprawling, and western.
320460	326560	The sovereignty of the Navajo Nation is best examined through its capital—Window Rock.
326560	331000	Its streets are lined with the offices of all the agencies and organizations running
331000	335460	the government functions that the Navajo Nation handles itself—the Division of Public
335460	339620	Safety, the Window Rock Police Department, the Office of Community Development, the Navajo
339620	344220	Nation Veterans Administration, the Navajo Housing Authority, the Navajo Nation Telecommunications
344220	348900	and Utility Agency, the Fish and Wildlife Department, the Heritage and Historic Preservation
348900	353260	Office, the Tribal Courts, the Supreme Court, the Office of Vital Records, the Council Chambers,
353260	356900	and the Navajo Nation Office of the President and Vice President.
356920	361920	Many similarly named structures could also be found in county, state, and national capitals
361920	366640	across the US and world, but there are some missing.
366640	370420	Also dotting the landscape of Window Rock are features like a branch of the United States
370420	375920	Postal Service, an office of the Arizona Motor Vehicle Department, Arizona State Route 264
375920	380080	maintained by the Arizona Department of Transportation, and an airport administered and regulated
380080	382200	by the American FAA.
382260	387420	Adding to that, one sees many of the chain services and stores of the United States—AFLAC,
387420	394260	H&R Block, Ace Hardware, Wells Fargo, Chevron, Bank of America, Quality Inn, McDonald's,
394260	395260	and more.
395260	399460	However, there is also a small, unique business landscape.
399460	404020	There are Navajo petroleum gas stations, owned by the Navajo Oil and Gas Company of the same
404020	408300	name, Basha's Diné Market, which, while owned and operated by the region-wide Basha's
408300	412260	brand, is a unique sub-brand carrying goods especially in demand by Diné like Bluebird
412260	416960	Flour and Mutton, and there's the Navajo Times which, while originally ran by the government,
416960	420200	is now a for-profit, financially independent newspaper.
420200	426280	So, the government and economy of the Navajo Nation is an amalgamation of Navajo and American
426280	433460	features, so considering that, can it be considered truly independent?
433460	438400	Independence is defined by a lack of dependence, so the answer to that revolves around their
438400	440600	relationship with the US.
440600	445700	The federal government's official terminology as to what tribal reservations are is quote
445700	449260	domestic, dependent nations.
449260	454100	While that term originates from an 1831 Supreme Court case, it's never used elsewhere to
454100	459620	define what any other geopolitical entity is, either in the US or internationally, so
459620	460620	it's rather ill-defined.
461620	467380	Therefore, for all intents and purposes, domestic dependent nation is essentially interchangeable
467380	470140	with the term Indian Reservation.
470140	476140	While what an American state is is well understood and defined, what an Indian Reservation is
476140	481500	is defined by a patchwork of decisions, guidelines, legislation, and treaties.
481500	486620	For example, the Indian Citizenship Act of 1924 made it so that all remaining indigenous
486620	492260	people living in the US not already a citizen would be granted such status meaning, functionally,
492260	497540	that all those living on tribal nations are obligated to pay taxes to the US federal government,
497540	501740	as the US uniquely taxes on citizenship and not residency.
501740	506820	However, when members of tribes live on tribal land, they do not pay taxes to the states
506820	509580	that that land is also a part of.
509580	514580	Window Rock, for example, is technically part of both Arizona and the Navajo Nation, but
514580	517380	its residents only pay taxes to the latter.
517380	522860	The tribes themselves, and therefore the reservations, do not pay taxes to either state or federal
522860	527100	governments, much like individual American states themselves.
527100	532360	Unlike states, however, tribal nations have something similar to a citizenship system.
532360	537140	Each tribe has the power to define who can become members and what the process of enrollment
537140	538180	looks like.
538180	543020	For example, in the case of the Navajo Nation, members need to be at least one-fourth Diné
543020	546900	by lineage, and not a member of any other tribe.
546900	551820	Building on that, private property is essentially nonexistent on tribal nations—the land is
551820	557060	held in trust by the US federal government, and then managed by the tribal governments.
557060	562360	Therefore, most residents either live in homes rented out by the tribal housing authority,
562360	564780	or in mobile homes on public land.
564780	569140	That's because banks won't give loans to build housing within reservations, as the
569140	573560	land upon which they'd be built is publicly owned, so it'd be impossible to repossess
573560	576060	the homes if payments fell behind.
576060	581380	They will loan for mobile homes, since they can be repossessed more easily, but altogether,
581380	586880	the policy of public land ownership effectively means tribal nations have immigration control.
586880	591060	You can only live in the Navajo Nation, for example, if you qualify for government housing,
591060	595580	and you only qualify for government housing if you're either Diné or working in the
595580	596580	nation.
597500	602340	During the COVID pandemic, the Navajo Nation enacted some of the strictest border restrictions
602340	607300	in the United States—essentially prohibiting access to all non-residents except when passing
607300	612980	through on state highways—and received no strong legal opposition to such action.
612980	618280	So altogether, the Navajo and other tribal nations have a level of power over who can
618280	623540	live and visit their territory that eclipses that of individual US states.
623540	628500	However, there are other ways in which these nations parallel states.
628500	632980	For example, the US federal government instructs its agencies to treat any interaction with
632980	636460	tribal nations as quote, government to government.
636460	641500	Also like states, tribal nations cannot engage in formal relations with foreign governments,
641500	647120	enter into a state of war, or issue currency—all key differentiators between nationhood and
647120	648120	countryhood.
648120	654420	However, somewhat unlike states, the Navajo Nation has this—a Washington office.
654420	659240	This functions somewhat like the offices of different state representatives in DC, however,
659240	663600	the Navajo Nation Washington office is closer to an embassy than these, as it exclusively
663600	668980	serves to represent the nation through non-voting means to the US government and its agencies.
668980	673760	The Navajo Nation wasn't the first to attempt to represent itself in Washington.
673760	679580	In 1995, the Chickasaw Nation, of Oklahoma, appointed Charles W. Blackwell as the first
679580	681540	tribal ambassador to the US.
681540	687020	In addition, they opened, what they called, a Chickasaw Nation Embassy in DC.
687020	691740	Now, neither the ambassador nor the embassy had the diplomatic protections of those of
691740	696420	foreign nations, so it's unclear how legitimate they were, but there were no challenges to
696420	699720	the nation setting up such a representative system.
699720	704320	The Cherokee Nation, also of Oklahoma, is now going a step further, as they believe
704320	708760	that they have a legal right to formal representation in Washington.
708760	714420	An 1835 treaty with the US gave the Cherokee Nation the power to send a non-voting representative
714420	720340	to the US Congress—similar to those appointed by the District of Columbia and US territories.
720340	725600	Until 2019, the Cherokee never appointed such a representative, but now decided to exercise
725600	729060	their rights when they appointed Kimberly Teehee to fill the position.
729060	735000	However, as of June 2021, she has yet to be ceded by Congress, meaning her power is
735000	737500	not yet formalized.
737500	741660	While it appears the nation has every legal right to take such action, it's a potentially
741660	747100	messy situation, as the people of the Cherokee tribe already have representation in Congress.
747100	752220	While DC and the territories do not receive voting congressional representation, the Cherokee
752220	758180	do as they live in Oklahoma, which, as a state, has voting members in Congress.
758180	762060	Having people represented twice in Congress would be unprecedented.
762060	767580	It's unclear as of now whether Teehee will be ceded, but the reality is that this situation
767580	773100	is like many involving tribal powers in the US—they don't know what they can do until
773100	774100	they try.
774100	779660	In fact, that was exactly what happened in the 1970s when Russell and Helen Bryan, of
779660	784900	the Chippewa Nation, received a property tax bill for around $200 from a county government
784900	787920	despite the fact that they were living on tribal land.
787920	791520	Having never received such a bill before, and not believing they were required to pay
791520	795600	it, they brought it to a local lawyer, who brought their case to the state courts.
795600	799840	They lost that case, and they then lost their appeal in the Minnesota Supreme Court, but
799840	803480	then they brought it to the United States Supreme Court.
803480	807760	Their decision said that not only do states lack the power to tax tribal members on their
807760	812420	reservations, but that states don't have the power to regulate any tribal activity
812420	814160	on their nations.
814160	820040	This was huge, and ideas soon arose as to how to profit from this decision.
820040	825520	Quite quickly, small-scale gambling operations sprung up on reservations, and within years,
825520	827960	large tribal casinos started opening.
827960	833600	Today, these casinos generate tens of billions of dollars in revenue for tribal nations annually,
833600	837760	especially for those lucky enough to be located near major metro areas where gambling is illegal,
837760	842540	such as the Chippewa Nation, which operates the largest casino in America, just 90 minutes
842540	843720	from Dallas.
843720	848700	Others, such as the Navajo Nation, are less lucky.
848700	853960	Located far from economic opportunity, their unemployment rate is 49%, their average household
853960	861400	income is $8,000, their poverty rate is 36%, and one third of their households lack access
861400	863360	to running water.
863360	868320	Tribal reservations in the US exist in a sort of in-between state.
868320	872200	Some sovereign powers are greater than those of states, but they lack the true level of
872200	875160	self-determination reserved for countries.
875160	879680	However, being in such a lonely club, these reservations don't receive the attention
879680	885040	necessary to reform a system that, in many cases, works against them.
885040	889340	For example, the system of public ownership of land means that it's essentially impossible
889340	893140	for those living on reservations to own their own home.
893140	897240	That means they can't build up wealth through home ownership and pass it on to the next
897240	898980	generation.
898980	904020	Others are located in some of the most rural areas of the US, in places already experiencing
904020	910400	the effects of deep rural-urban economic divide, but being isolated from the system of states,
910400	914560	and ignored by the federal government due to their political irrelevance, they perpetually
914560	918860	fall into the category of not my problem.
918860	923920	While there is opportunity in sovereignty, it cannot be realized without trying, and
923920	929040	trying new things is effectively impossible for places so deeply entrenched in a cycle
929040	930160	of poverty.
930160	935920	So, the answer to what the Navajo Nation, or any Native American reservation is, is
935920	937320	that nobody knows.
937320	942400	They're what the federal government lets them be, and so far, there hasn't been enough
942400	947240	time or money for them to explore their boundaries.
947240	951360	So, just over a year ago, I realized something.
951360	954960	I had become a take-out and delivery addict.
954960	958800	Being a busy person, by the time I got to dinner every day, I was tired and ready to
958800	963800	just relax, so I would default to the easiest, most convenient option for food.
963800	969200	However, eventually I realized the huge downsides of take-out and delivery—it's incredibly
969200	973520	expensive when done regularly, and generally just not very healthy.
973520	976420	So, I switched to HelloFresh.
976420	980440	This is all completely true, and I have hundreds of their recipe carts to prove it, as I've
980440	983000	now used them regularly for just over a year.
983000	987500	So, a few months ago, I asked them to sponsor the channel, and now they have.
