0	5400	The beginning of the rise didn't look like the beginning of a rise.
5400	10520	Not far from the tiny country of El Salvador's capital city, San Salvador, is a smaller city,
10520	11680	Santa Tecla.
11680	15960	And not far outside of Santa Tecla is the tiny coffee town of Nuevo Cuscatlan.
15960	21720	Though only a seven-mile, 12-kilometer drive from San Salvador, this 7,000-person city
21720	23920	feels far away from the busy capital.
24480	30280	And it was here in 2012 where 2,754 voters put their faith in a young, business-savvy
30280	35260	political newcomer for mayor, defeating the Conservative Party opposition by the slimmest
35260	39040	of margins—just 169 votes.
39040	43080	But such a narrow margin didn't dim the young, naive Bukele's ambition.
43080	48700	While he ran with the leftist FMLN, Bukele's campaign from the very beginning focused less
48700	54860	on party lines and more on purpose—a confident, energetic 30-year-old bent on snuffing out
54860	59900	crime and corruption, and investing in education, infrastructure, and community development.
59900	66340	Today, the marks of Bukele's time as mayor are hard to miss in Nuevo Cuscatlan.
66340	68360	First came education.
68360	71900	Upon taking office, Bukele announced he'd forfeited salary so he could instead help
71900	74100	fund a scholarship program.
74100	79300	In that year, Nuevo Cuscatlan's illiteracy rate stood at about 15%.
79300	84220	With the launch of a city-wide reading program, Salvadoran press celebrated that in 2015,
84220	88980	the city was free of illiteracy, making it the third town in the department to reach
88980	92980	the mark and moving it well ahead of the national average.
92980	96780	The other metric that Bukele would go on to tout in future campaigns was that while he
96780	101340	was in office, Nuevo Cuscatlan only saw a single homicide.
101340	105520	While the exact number was disputed, the exceptionally low homicide rate was a major
105520	110460	point of pride, as the country has been fighting the violent and entrenched MS-13 and Barrio
110460	113740	18 gangs since the end of its civil war in 1992.
113740	119460	It's been an uphill battle against the hyper-violent and incredibly cruel gangs since Bukele was
119460	124340	a teenager, so no matter how relatively safe the small town was to begin with, in a country
124340	129420	with a legacy of gang violence, such a safety record was as much an accomplishment as education
129420	131680	for the young mayor.
131680	135520	The other successes of Bukele's office were more tangible.
135520	140420	At the end of 2012, the city opened its first 24-7 medical clinic.
140420	144100	Moving fast and not worried about how the city would pay for things, ground broke on
144100	147820	a new library, and the city embarked on a multi-million dollar water project that would
147820	154100	make drinking water available 24 hours a day rather than the meager 3 hours available previously.
154100	160220	In three years, Nuevo Cuscatlon went from an unexceptional provincial town to exemplary.
160220	165220	If politicians just took bold action, the town proved, things could change for the better
165220	166220	of everyone.
166220	171340	At the same pace that the city changed, the leader of the transformation went from unheard
171340	174100	of to the next big thing.
174100	178460	Prior to politics, Bukele's career had made stops in consulting and political advertising
178460	180900	for the party he now represented.
180900	185200	Now as a politician himself, he made the most of his professional experience.
185200	188820	No good deed would go unclaimed or underreported.
188820	192860	If infrastructure and education projects didn't sell Salvadorans on the small-town mayor standing
192860	196860	as a politician for the people, perhaps the YouTube channel would.
196860	200420	Here he posted clips of his interviews and debates that aired over local television.
200420	204920	But he didn't stop at just getting his message out—use the platform to further an image
204920	209140	of a man firmly for the people, posting videos of him moving through the town, talking with
209140	214340	kids, celebrating the launch of the medical center, and answering questions from the community.
214340	217360	The brand building wasn't confined to the internet, either.
217360	221380	On everything that the mayor touched—the library, the hospital, the signs at city limits
221380	225880	and construction sites alike, and the podiums from which he spoke—was now a light blue
225880	230980	M, which replaced the city's prior logo and highlighted the positive transformations
230980	235000	directly connected to Nayib Bukele's term.
235000	236220	The project worked.
236220	240440	He remade the city, and in doing so, built a personal image as a champion of the people
240440	244600	unafraid to greenlight big projects and take big swings.
244600	248940	While mayor for only a single three-year term, journalists now visiting years on are hard
248940	254260	pressed to find a single person in Nuevo Cuscatlón that has a bad thing to say about him.
254260	258800	While Bukele's time as mayor was transformative, it was also short.
258800	263100	Bigger things beckoned, as both he and the FMLN recognized that the new guy with bold
263100	268700	ideas and a record so sterling had huge potential in a political environment dominated by aging
268700	272440	voices of the civil war that had ended decades ago.
272440	276280	The logical progression was the mayor's office of the nation's capital—an office
276280	281120	that would garner more attention and potentially position the ascendant politician for a presidential
281120	282120	run.
282120	286800	While San Salvador dwarfs Nuevo Cuscatlón, Bukele took a similar approach.
286800	291960	He built a new library, reinvigorated old shopping markets, invested in infrastructure,
291960	297020	spent serious money, and signed off on glitzy vanity projects to ensure his image rose along
297020	298860	with the city's.
298860	302780	Salvadorans followed, and his popularity continued to rise.
302780	306820	Nationally, though, other trends were on the rise in equal proportion.
306820	312560	By the time Bukele took office, a truce between MS-13, BRIO-18, and the national government
312560	314340	had recently collapsed.
314340	319160	In two years, homicide rates had more than doubled, and by 2015, the country was seeing
319160	324560	an average of 18 homicides a day, while its 103 homicides per 100,000 inhabitants had
324560	327100	ballooned to the world's worst rate.
327100	331880	At the very same time, the nation's prisons were beginning to overflow as the federal
331880	336900	government leaned back into heavy-handed gang policies that threw more and more gang-affiliated
336900	339240	Salvadorans behind bars.
339240	344740	From 2010 to 2016, the country's total prison population grew by more than 11,000, while
344740	348180	the incarceration rate hit 579.
348180	354320	They're outpacing any other Central American country, and nearing the top of the list globally.
354320	358360	While Nayib Bukele's name recognition was expanding, and image as a big-idea reformer
358360	362160	was sharpening, the country was crumbling.
362160	367920	Gangs killed dispassionately, while the government arrested citizens indiscriminately.
367920	371440	Salvadorans were nothing short of desperate for change, as the threat of gang violence
371440	375600	now impacted every aspect of everyday life.
375600	382160	Old politicians and old policies just weren't enough anymore—a lane emerged.
382160	388080	For decades, El Salvador's politics effectively ran as a two-party system—it was FMLN,
388080	389620	or it was ARENA.
389620	393740	No serious candidates would even consider running for high office without aligning themselves
393740	395540	with one of the two.
395540	399580	But despite surging popularity, Bukele's support from FMLN?
399580	404580	His party was waning as he constantly broke rank and strayed from their platform, so in
404580	409120	response, he was failing to get the votes of his own party members for some of his mayoral
409120	412800	ambitions—they became the barrier to his goals.
412800	417360	This quickly devolved into a vicious cycle of one criticizing the other, and vice versa,
417360	421280	before finally, Bukele gave them an excuse to get rid of him.
421280	426680	FMLN officials alleged that he called their lawyer a bruja, a derogatory term that roughly
426680	428320	translates to witch.
428320	433480	This, and its violation of their ethics policies, was the reason given for his expulsion from
433480	439220	FMLN, but all understood that it was heavily, if not entirely, predicated by his increasingly
439220	442920	distant and hostile relationship with the party.
442920	448540	The fallout with FMLN took Bukele off what appeared a predestined path towards the presidency.
448540	453260	He clearly couldn't join ARENA, the opposition, and without either support, precedent suggested
453260	459060	a successful presidential run was impossible—but regardless, he forged on.
459060	463300	Wanting to form his own party, but unable to in time for the upcoming election, Bukele
463300	467840	teamed up with the Grande Allianzade parle Unidad Nacional, meaning his incredibly longshot
467840	470800	presidential run could begin.
470800	475760	Both traditional nominees, backed by the traditional parties, ran traditional campaigns—rotating
475760	479840	between TV appearances, radio interviews, and stump speeches about why they'd be the
479840	483560	best person to put at the helm of the Salvadoran political system.
483560	488500	Bukele, meanwhile, argued that the system itself was the problem—he promised to gut
488500	492120	the establishment and its corruption, largely delivering this message through Facebook and
492120	495840	Twitter, attaining skyrocketing engagement with each.
495840	500100	His few physical campaign events more closely resembled parties, as he hosted dressed like
500100	504180	a Silicon Valley CEO, not a suited presidential candidate.
504180	508620	As election day neared, the polls trended increasingly towards his direction, and, so
508620	513280	confident in his position, he didn't even show up to the debates, unwilling to even
513280	517760	engage with the mainstream political candidacy system.
517760	520540	It may have been risky, but it worked.
520540	527520	The FMLN candidate attained 14.4% of the vote, the arena won 31.7%, and Naeib Bukele,
527520	535240	the 37-year-old outsider, commanded 53.1%—such a decisive victory that the almost inevitable
535240	538660	runoff wasn't even necessary.
538660	545240	On June 1st, 2019, Bukele assumed office and became the 43rd president of the Republic
545240	547740	of El Salvador.
547740	548740	Change came quick.
548860	553800	In the days that followed, Bukele unveiled his so-called territorial control plan—the
553800	556900	plan that would transform El Salvador from one of the most dangerous countries in the
556900	561280	world to one where people could simply go outside without fear.
561280	566680	It reportedly had six phases, with a seventh to be implemented only if the rest didn't
566680	567680	work.
567680	571440	Each phase was only unveiled at its start, but the first started just 20 days into his
571440	573720	presidency and was dubbed preparation.
574300	578860	It comprised a surge of police and military into 12 of the country's most dangerous
578860	583100	communities, ones that were effectively gang-held territory, along with initiating a state of
583100	587200	emergency in the nation's prisons, prohibiting visitors and calls so that incarcerated gang
587200	589460	leaders could no longer communicate.
589460	594420	Essentially, the idea was to just start—to use the resources on hand to do what they
594420	597820	could to start to fracture gang structures.
597820	600020	The next phase was opportunity.
600040	603880	Just as a way to foster public support before the more heavy-handed phases to come, this
603880	608660	second step involved using a $91 million loan from the Central American Bank for Economic
608660	613200	Integration to invest in community centers, skate parks, schools, and other services that
613200	617040	would work to prevent young people from joining gangs in the first place.
617040	620500	But phase three was where things got tricky.
620500	624220	The name was modernization, and the idea was to buy the country's national security forces
624220	630000	some $109 million in equipment—drones, helicopters, guns, everything they'd need to fight a
630000	632580	an all-out war with the gangs.
632580	637100	The only roadblock to implementing this was that the $109 million loan, again from the
637100	642060	Central American Bank for Economic Integration, would have to be approved by the country's
642060	643500	Legislative Assembly.
643500	648800	The Legislative Assembly, however, was formed by an election in March 2018—almost a year
648800	652820	before Bukele's election, long before he could influence an outcome.
652820	659360	Therefore, the Legacy, Arena, and FMLN parties held 53 of the 84 seats—a firm majority,
659360	663020	while Bukele's adoptive party, Ghana, had just 10.
663020	668800	Essentially, in order to do anything, including get this $109 million loan, the president
668800	673100	had to appeal to the lawmakers from the two parties he had just convinced the entire country
673100	675820	were the problem in his campaign.
675820	680740	Unsurprisingly, the parties pushed back, asking for more transparency on where funds would
680740	687120	go, leaving the loan, and phase three of Bukele's crucial territorial control plan deadlocked.
687120	688980	This is where things got iffy.
688980	694240	Supposedly, the president invoked one of the powers granted to him by the Constitution—Article
694240	699960	167, Part 7—which allowed the officeholder to convene an extraordinary session of the
699960	704220	Legislative Assembly when, quote, the interests of the Republic demand it.
704220	709360	While vague, many questioned whether the lack of approval of a loan constituted an extraordinary
709360	713040	situation worthy of an emergency legislative session.
713040	716600	While lawmakers squabbled over whether this was a legal maneuver, and therefore whether
716600	720760	they would attend the Sunday session, Bukele pushed back, saying it was their constitutional
720760	726320	requirement and threatening them by publicly reminding everyone of Article 87.
726320	730520	Article 87 of the Constitution states that people have the right to mount an insurrection
730520	736220	if lawmakers fail to follow the Constitution, and therefore, Bukele implicitly asked his
736220	742080	supporters to come to the Legislative Assembly prepared to overthrow the government.
742080	747280	So they did, surrounding the building, but ultimately, only twenty of eighty-four lawmakers
747280	751800	showed up—far from the minimum needed to legally vote on legislation.
751800	756000	Regardless, Bukele arrived, and not alone.
756000	760000	Marching into the chamber with him were dozens of police and military personnel donned in
760000	763300	military fatigues and armed with rifles.
763300	767760	While they surrounded lawmakers, Bukele delivered a brief ten-minute speech demanding a return
767760	772920	to what he considered constitutional order, furious that the majority of lawmakers disobeyed
772920	774440	his dubious order.
774440	778880	Now the key question was what this event actually was.
778880	784200	Was it Bukele bringing in the army and police essentially as props—visual devices to convey
784200	788000	the importance of passing the legislation that would better equip them, or was it a
788000	790960	show of force, an implicit threat?
790960	795400	A reminder to lawmakers that the guys with the guns were on his side, which they very
795400	799880	much were, given the $109 million he was about to give them.
799880	804360	While this series of events was quickly considered a constitutional crisis and critiqued the
804360	810640	world over, distraction came quick as the COVID-19 virus reached El Salvador's borders.
810640	815620	On March 21st, the President announced a mandatory nationwide lockdown, with violators subject
815620	819620	to detainment in special pandemic containment centers.
819620	824520	Almost immediately, potential legal issues arose—some seventy people were arrested
824520	828880	in the early hours of March 22nd, before the details of the President's decree were
828880	835160	even published—that is, arrested for violation of a law that wasn't even officially publicized.
835160	839360	Others were arrested for not wearing masks, despite not yet being legally required, others
839360	844440	still for traveling to jobs deemed essential by the decree itself—it was a constitutionally
844440	849480	dubious law to begin with, but even then it was applied arbitrarily and with problematically
849480	850640	generous interpretation.
851520	855720	In a matter of weeks, the Supreme Court struck the decree down, saying that detainment without
855720	860440	due process could only happen in response to a suspicion that a person might be infected,
860440	863680	not simply for violation of the lockdown order.
863680	868080	Of course, Bukele pushed back, building a loophole, saying that those found in violation
868080	872640	of the lockdown would not be held for violation of the order itself, but rather under suspicion
872640	876680	that they might be infected because they violated lockdown orders.
877200	883280	Put another way, the Supreme Court made a ruling, then Bukele and the police just decided
883280	885160	to ignore it.
885160	887780	This storyline continued in 2021.
887780	892760	On February 28th, the country voted in a new legislative assembly, and Nuevas Edeas, the
892760	896560	new party founded by the President, decisively swept.
896560	898080	This was no surprise.
898080	902280	Through this all, Bukele was incredibly popular.
902540	906960	Opinion polling hovered around 90% approval rating, making him one of, if not the most
906960	909520	popular president in the world.
909520	915440	This popularity translated to his party winning 56 of 84 seats—that's to say, they alone
915440	917120	held a majority.
917120	922200	No longer would Bukele have to face the opposition of the majority of the legislative assembly.
922200	925680	No longer would he need to concede to FMLA and arena wishes.
925680	932240	So just one major roadblock remained—the Supreme Court itself.
932240	936480	Thanks to the new Nuevas Edeas majority, though, all it took was a vote.
936480	939940	The President said the body was making arbitrary rulings that were impeding his ability to
939940	944560	manage the pandemic, the national legislator voted to dismiss the five dissenting judges,
944560	948280	and Bukele filled the bench with five new ones that would vote as he wished.
948280	956580	Bukele now, by proxy, held all three branches of power—executive, legislative, and judicial—and
956580	962040	with that he could do, well, just about anything he wanted.
962040	967320	Well Salvador's weekend of March 25th through 27th, 2022 was tragic.
967320	970880	Nobody's exactly sure why, but the gangs were mad.
970880	975420	Many speculate in response to the breakdown of a secret truce between them and the government—special
975420	979100	treatment in jail in exchange for relative peace on the streets.
979100	987500	Whatever it was, some 87 seemingly random people were murdered, and Bukele was furious.
987500	992260	Because of slow and steady progress, a small early sign of success of his territorial control
992260	996380	plan were reversed in just one weekend.
996380	1001300	So he went to the Legislative Assembly, and they approved a 30-day so-called state of
1001300	1004940	exception suspending constitutional rights.
1004940	1007940	Police wouldn't have to tell people why they're being arrested, they wouldn't
1007940	1011100	need to read them their rights, detainees wouldn't have a right to legal counsel,
1011100	1015260	and they could be held for up to 15 days without seeing a judge.
1015260	1020540	The state of exception paved the way for mass arbitrary detention, so that's exactly
1020540	1023020	what came quick.
1023020	1027300	Police and military swarmed gang strongholds, arresting any known members, but also arresting
1027300	1030340	anyone who appeared that they could be in a gang.
1030340	1034320	Tattoos, by themselves, were enough to get thrown in jail.
1034320	1037880	Police were reportedly subject to daily arrest quotas and encountered little blowback for
1037880	1041680	false arrests, pushing them to just arrest anyone that they could imagine being a gang
1041680	1044960	member, regardless of facts or evidence.
1044960	1049080	By midnight Sunday of that tragic weekend, some 600 people had been arrested.
1049080	1052240	By the end of the week, 6,000.
1052240	1057400	And now, one year on, with the state of exception having been renewed and renewed and renewed,
1057400	1061440	nearly 70,000 suspected gang members have been detained.
1061440	1066960	2% of the nation's adult population is behind bars, in overcrowded prisons stuffed three
1066960	1071280	or four times beyond capacity, waiting to make their way through an overburdened judicial
1071280	1072480	system.
1072480	1076540	Members and fathers still search in desperation for their arrested children, unable to track
1076540	1081000	them down in the system even after a year, but increasingly, they're being sent here,
1081000	1085120	to the brand new Terrorism Confinement Center.
1085120	1089460	This facility was built at breakneck pace once the gang roundups began, and opened for
1089460	1091840	business in early 2023.
1091840	1095640	It was introduced to the nation through a highly choreographed, scripted, and produced
1095640	1098280	35-minute video tour with Bukele.
1098800	1102640	Throughout, the video stressed the president's influence on the project, how his logic and
1102640	1107160	smarts created a better system, and exhibited the scale of the security forces, thanks to
1107160	1111840	Bukele, the quality of their equipment, thanks to Bukele, and the ultimate degree of control
1111840	1115520	the government would have, thanks to Bukele.
1115520	1120820	After all, the prison was capable of holding some 40,000 inmates, making it the largest
1120820	1127840	prison in the world—a single facility capable of housing the population of a small country.
1127840	1130880	The thing is, all of this worked.
1130880	1136560	While in March 2022, the country averaged 4.8 homicides a day, a bump upwards over the
1136560	1143240	year's average of 3.1, April, the first full month of the roundups, saw just 1.3.
1143240	1147280	In May, the trend continued—just 0.5 homicides a day.
1147280	1153680	In fact, since April 2022, not a single month encountered an average daily homicide count
1153680	1154920	over one.
1155400	1160320	While some question the exact validity of the data, the broad truth is undeniable—El
1160320	1163960	Salvador is as safe as it's been in decades.
1163960	1169840	For the first time in many residents' lifetimes, people can actually walk the streets, actually
1169840	1172320	live life without fear.
1172320	1176000	The feeling is freeing, life-changing.
1176000	1181280	After decades of hopelessness, it's like living in a new nation, one with a better,
1181280	1183520	brighter future.
1183520	1186360	Bukele is as popular as he's ever been.
1186360	1190400	The checks and balances of power may have been degraded, the judicial system may have
1190400	1196280	broken down, thousands may be unjustly detained, but in the opinion of the vast majority of
1196280	1200480	Salvadorans, the ends justify the means.
1200480	1206000	Polling shows Bukele's approval rating still around 90%, making him still perhaps the most
1206000	1208680	popular president in the world.
1208680	1212480	Elsewhere, however, his image is different.
1212480	1217080	Bukele has been condemned by just about anyone in the business of condemning—the United
1217080	1222760	Nations, Human Rights Watch, the US State Department, international media—very few
1222760	1225400	come to his support globally.
1225400	1229360	All express concern for the backsliding from democracy.
1229360	1234600	El Salvador is nine months away from its next presidential elections, and Bukele has announced
1234600	1235840	he's running.
1235840	1241480	This is despite what Article 152 of the country's constitution reads—quote, the following
1241480	1245840	shall not be candidates for the president of the republic, he who has filled the presidency
1245840	1249960	of the republic for more than six months, consecutive or not, during the period immediately
1249960	1255040	prior to or within the last six months prior to the beginning of the presidential period.
1255040	1259140	This line was always interpreted to mean that one could not be president for two consecutive
1259140	1266260	terms—until 2021, when the newly overhauled, Bukele-appointed Supreme Court reversed course,
1266260	1269840	saying that consecutive terms would be allowed.
1269840	1274920	No legal justification was given—only that denying a second term to a popular president
1274920	1278340	would be denying the will of the people.
1278340	1283260	This is true—the people want Bukele to remain in power.
1283260	1287360	He has seemingly solved the nation's biggest issue in a way that the people are supportive
1287360	1291960	of—he's done the job he was democratically elected to do.
1291960	1297120	Across every step in the process, he has retained the support of the people, even as he consolidated
1297120	1300100	power across all three branches of government.
1300100	1304760	He now has few, if any, legal checks on his power, considering he is able to modify or
1304760	1312360	reinterpret the constitution as he pleases—he is essentially a democratically elected dictator.
1312360	1317120	The dissonance between the opinion of El Salvador and that of the rest of the world has an air
1317120	1322560	of paternalism to it—it feels like the developed world is telling El Salvador that it knows
1322560	1328080	best—that the Salvadoran people are incapable of making decisions for themselves.
1328080	1332200	This dynamic has been a feature of the nation's relationship with the US in particular for
1332200	1338280	decades—the superpower has long meddled with domestic Salvadoran politics.
1338280	1343020	Much of the supposed international concern is likely rooted in this—a condescending
1343020	1348000	feeling of impossibility that the country truly figured something out on its own.
1348000	1353120	But a distinct other part of the concern is likely rooted in the more objective, rational,
1353120	1358060	emotionless analysis people who didn't live through decades of war-like state are able
1358060	1362840	to undertake—the potentially more accurate understanding of the sacrifices being made
1362840	1366960	to solve the crippling crisis of gang violence.
1366960	1372280	Leaders come and go—even if Bukele is a perfect, benevolent dictator for life, he
1372280	1377000	will eventually leave office, either democratically or through death.
1377000	1382500	It is possible, even common, that checks and balances in a democratic system get in
1382500	1384360	the way of progress.
1384360	1387680	They make things slow, but they also make things methodical.
1387680	1392520	It's through this process that decisions are properly vetted—it's a system of government
1392520	1397200	designed to depend on the system itself, rather than any particular individual.
1397200	1402960	So, it's a system of government that makes short-term sacrifices for the long-term gain.
1402960	1407160	El Salvador, meanwhile, has flipped that on its head—it's putting all of its eggs
1407160	1412480	in one basket, and making long-term sacrifices for short-term gain.
1412480	1413960	Maybe the people are right.
1413960	1418840	Maybe it's a sacrifice worth making to solve the number one issue holding the nation back.
1418840	1423840	Or maybe the international observers are right—maybe their outside perspective is valuable, and
1423840	1427240	the country truly is making a colossal mistake.
1427240	1432820	But what sure is that, if it is a mistake, it's their mistake to make.
1432820	1437960	As a sovereign nation, the Salvadoran people have the right to decide on their own, without
1437960	1443860	international meddling, what they want to do, even if that means the democratic election
1443860	1446120	of a dictator.
1446120	1450060	The accessibility of smartphones these days has changed a lot, but one interesting thing
1450060	1453440	I think it's changed most dramatically is what happens when we don't have something
1453440	1454440	to do.
1454440	1458680	If we're waiting for the subway, or to pick someone up, or for a class to start, we tend
1458680	1462880	to now fill those moments by checking Twitter, or scrolling TikTok, or some other way of
1462880	1466100	getting a quick hit of dopamine, because we tell ourselves that there's really nothing
1466100	1470160	productive or meaningful we can do in five or ten minutes.
1470160	1474240	But all those five or ten minutes really add up, so rather than wasting them, you can use
1474240	1475800	them to learn something new.
1475800	1478440	That's the idea behind our sponsor Brilliant.
1478440	1482640	They're a STEM learning platform that designs these incredible interactive courses that
1482640	1487140	take big, complex subjects like calculus, or physics, or computer science, and break
1487140	1491620	them down into small bite-sized chunks that you can learn at your own pace.
1491620	1495420	You might only learn a tiny bit of calculus in five minutes, but once you keep at it,
1495420	1499660	filling all your free five minutes, it adds up into a meaningful understanding of a subject
1499660	1502860	that might have previously seemed impossible to learn.
1502860	1506500	I think it's incredible that they allow you to reach that satisfying feeling of achieving
1506500	1509900	a challenging goal just by using the free time you already have.
1509900	1513700	And truly anyone can learn through Brilliant no matter their educational background, as
1513700	1517580	they have clear, concise explanations, and then let you learn by doing through interactive
1517580	1518580	challenges.
