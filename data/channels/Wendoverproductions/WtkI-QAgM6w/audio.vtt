00:00.000 --> 00:05.400
The beginning of the rise didn't look like the beginning of a rise.

00:05.400 --> 00:10.520
Not far from the tiny country of El Salvador's capital city, San Salvador, is a smaller city,

00:10.520 --> 00:11.680
Santa Tecla.

00:11.680 --> 00:15.960
And not far outside of Santa Tecla is the tiny coffee town of Nuevo Cuscatlan.

00:15.960 --> 00:21.720
Though only a seven-mile, 12-kilometer drive from San Salvador, this 7,000-person city

00:21.720 --> 00:23.920
feels far away from the busy capital.

00:24.480 --> 00:30.280
And it was here in 2012 where 2,754 voters put their faith in a young, business-savvy

00:30.280 --> 00:35.260
political newcomer for mayor, defeating the Conservative Party opposition by the slimmest

00:35.260 --> 00:39.040
of margins—just 169 votes.

00:39.040 --> 00:43.080
But such a narrow margin didn't dim the young, naive Bukele's ambition.

00:43.080 --> 00:48.700
While he ran with the leftist FMLN, Bukele's campaign from the very beginning focused less

00:48.700 --> 00:54.860
on party lines and more on purpose—a confident, energetic 30-year-old bent on snuffing out

00:54.860 --> 00:59.900
crime and corruption, and investing in education, infrastructure, and community development.

00:59.900 --> 01:06.340
Today, the marks of Bukele's time as mayor are hard to miss in Nuevo Cuscatlan.

01:06.340 --> 01:08.360
First came education.

01:08.360 --> 01:11.900
Upon taking office, Bukele announced he'd forfeited salary so he could instead help

01:11.900 --> 01:14.100
fund a scholarship program.

01:14.100 --> 01:19.300
In that year, Nuevo Cuscatlan's illiteracy rate stood at about 15%.

01:19.300 --> 01:24.220
With the launch of a city-wide reading program, Salvadoran press celebrated that in 2015,

01:24.220 --> 01:28.980
the city was free of illiteracy, making it the third town in the department to reach

01:28.980 --> 01:32.980
the mark and moving it well ahead of the national average.

01:32.980 --> 01:36.780
The other metric that Bukele would go on to tout in future campaigns was that while he

01:36.780 --> 01:41.340
was in office, Nuevo Cuscatlan only saw a single homicide.

01:41.340 --> 01:45.520
While the exact number was disputed, the exceptionally low homicide rate was a major

01:45.520 --> 01:50.460
point of pride, as the country has been fighting the violent and entrenched MS-13 and Barrio

01:50.460 --> 01:53.740
18 gangs since the end of its civil war in 1992.

01:53.740 --> 01:59.460
It's been an uphill battle against the hyper-violent and incredibly cruel gangs since Bukele was

01:59.460 --> 02:04.340
a teenager, so no matter how relatively safe the small town was to begin with, in a country

02:04.340 --> 02:09.420
with a legacy of gang violence, such a safety record was as much an accomplishment as education

02:09.420 --> 02:11.680
for the young mayor.

02:11.680 --> 02:15.520
The other successes of Bukele's office were more tangible.

02:15.520 --> 02:20.420
At the end of 2012, the city opened its first 24-7 medical clinic.

02:20.420 --> 02:24.100
Moving fast and not worried about how the city would pay for things, ground broke on

02:24.100 --> 02:27.820
a new library, and the city embarked on a multi-million dollar water project that would

02:27.820 --> 02:34.100
make drinking water available 24 hours a day rather than the meager 3 hours available previously.

02:34.100 --> 02:40.220
In three years, Nuevo Cuscatlon went from an unexceptional provincial town to exemplary.

02:40.220 --> 02:45.220
If politicians just took bold action, the town proved, things could change for the better

02:45.220 --> 02:46.220
of everyone.

02:46.220 --> 02:51.340
At the same pace that the city changed, the leader of the transformation went from unheard

02:51.340 --> 02:54.100
of to the next big thing.

02:54.100 --> 02:58.460
Prior to politics, Bukele's career had made stops in consulting and political advertising

02:58.460 --> 03:00.900
for the party he now represented.

03:00.900 --> 03:05.200
Now as a politician himself, he made the most of his professional experience.

03:05.200 --> 03:08.820
No good deed would go unclaimed or underreported.

03:08.820 --> 03:12.860
If infrastructure and education projects didn't sell Salvadorans on the small-town mayor standing

03:12.860 --> 03:16.860
as a politician for the people, perhaps the YouTube channel would.

03:16.860 --> 03:20.420
Here he posted clips of his interviews and debates that aired over local television.

03:20.420 --> 03:24.920
But he didn't stop at just getting his message out—use the platform to further an image

03:24.920 --> 03:29.140
of a man firmly for the people, posting videos of him moving through the town, talking with

03:29.140 --> 03:34.340
kids, celebrating the launch of the medical center, and answering questions from the community.

03:34.340 --> 03:37.360
The brand building wasn't confined to the internet, either.

03:37.360 --> 03:41.380
On everything that the mayor touched—the library, the hospital, the signs at city limits

03:41.380 --> 03:45.880
and construction sites alike, and the podiums from which he spoke—was now a light blue

03:45.880 --> 03:50.980
M, which replaced the city's prior logo and highlighted the positive transformations

03:50.980 --> 03:55.000
directly connected to Nayib Bukele's term.

03:55.000 --> 03:56.220
The project worked.

03:56.220 --> 04:00.440
He remade the city, and in doing so, built a personal image as a champion of the people

04:00.440 --> 04:04.600
unafraid to greenlight big projects and take big swings.

04:04.600 --> 04:08.940
While mayor for only a single three-year term, journalists now visiting years on are hard

04:08.940 --> 04:14.260
pressed to find a single person in Nuevo Cuscatlón that has a bad thing to say about him.

04:14.260 --> 04:18.800
While Bukele's time as mayor was transformative, it was also short.

04:18.800 --> 04:23.100
Bigger things beckoned, as both he and the FMLN recognized that the new guy with bold

04:23.100 --> 04:28.700
ideas and a record so sterling had huge potential in a political environment dominated by aging

04:28.700 --> 04:32.440
voices of the civil war that had ended decades ago.

04:32.440 --> 04:36.280
The logical progression was the mayor's office of the nation's capital—an office

04:36.280 --> 04:41.120
that would garner more attention and potentially position the ascendant politician for a presidential

04:41.120 --> 04:42.120
run.

04:42.120 --> 04:46.800
While San Salvador dwarfs Nuevo Cuscatlón, Bukele took a similar approach.

04:46.800 --> 04:51.960
He built a new library, reinvigorated old shopping markets, invested in infrastructure,

04:51.960 --> 04:57.020
spent serious money, and signed off on glitzy vanity projects to ensure his image rose along

04:57.020 --> 04:58.860
with the city's.

04:58.860 --> 05:02.780
Salvadorans followed, and his popularity continued to rise.

05:02.780 --> 05:06.820
Nationally, though, other trends were on the rise in equal proportion.

05:06.820 --> 05:12.560
By the time Bukele took office, a truce between MS-13, BRIO-18, and the national government

05:12.560 --> 05:14.340
had recently collapsed.

05:14.340 --> 05:19.160
In two years, homicide rates had more than doubled, and by 2015, the country was seeing

05:19.160 --> 05:24.560
an average of 18 homicides a day, while its 103 homicides per 100,000 inhabitants had

05:24.560 --> 05:27.100
ballooned to the world's worst rate.

05:27.100 --> 05:31.880
At the very same time, the nation's prisons were beginning to overflow as the federal

05:31.880 --> 05:36.900
government leaned back into heavy-handed gang policies that threw more and more gang-affiliated

05:36.900 --> 05:39.240
Salvadorans behind bars.

05:39.240 --> 05:44.740
From 2010 to 2016, the country's total prison population grew by more than 11,000, while

05:44.740 --> 05:48.180
the incarceration rate hit 579.

05:48.180 --> 05:54.320
They're outpacing any other Central American country, and nearing the top of the list globally.

05:54.320 --> 05:58.360
While Nayib Bukele's name recognition was expanding, and image as a big-idea reformer

05:58.360 --> 06:02.160
was sharpening, the country was crumbling.

06:02.160 --> 06:07.920
Gangs killed dispassionately, while the government arrested citizens indiscriminately.

06:07.920 --> 06:11.440
Salvadorans were nothing short of desperate for change, as the threat of gang violence

06:11.440 --> 06:15.600
now impacted every aspect of everyday life.

06:15.600 --> 06:22.160
Old politicians and old policies just weren't enough anymore—a lane emerged.

06:22.160 --> 06:28.080
For decades, El Salvador's politics effectively ran as a two-party system—it was FMLN,

06:28.080 --> 06:29.620
or it was ARENA.

06:29.620 --> 06:33.740
No serious candidates would even consider running for high office without aligning themselves

06:33.740 --> 06:35.540
with one of the two.

06:35.540 --> 06:39.580
But despite surging popularity, Bukele's support from FMLN?

06:39.580 --> 06:44.580
His party was waning as he constantly broke rank and strayed from their platform, so in

06:44.580 --> 06:49.120
response, he was failing to get the votes of his own party members for some of his mayoral

06:49.120 --> 06:52.800
ambitions—they became the barrier to his goals.

06:52.800 --> 06:57.360
This quickly devolved into a vicious cycle of one criticizing the other, and vice versa,

06:57.360 --> 07:01.280
before finally, Bukele gave them an excuse to get rid of him.

07:01.280 --> 07:06.680
FMLN officials alleged that he called their lawyer a bruja, a derogatory term that roughly

07:06.680 --> 07:08.320
translates to witch.

07:08.320 --> 07:13.480
This, and its violation of their ethics policies, was the reason given for his expulsion from

07:13.480 --> 07:19.220
FMLN, but all understood that it was heavily, if not entirely, predicated by his increasingly

07:19.220 --> 07:22.920
distant and hostile relationship with the party.

07:22.920 --> 07:28.540
The fallout with FMLN took Bukele off what appeared a predestined path towards the presidency.

07:28.540 --> 07:33.260
He clearly couldn't join ARENA, the opposition, and without either support, precedent suggested

07:33.260 --> 07:39.060
a successful presidential run was impossible—but regardless, he forged on.

07:39.060 --> 07:43.300
Wanting to form his own party, but unable to in time for the upcoming election, Bukele

07:43.300 --> 07:47.840
teamed up with the Grande Allianzade parle Unidad Nacional, meaning his incredibly longshot

07:47.840 --> 07:50.800
presidential run could begin.

07:50.800 --> 07:55.760
Both traditional nominees, backed by the traditional parties, ran traditional campaigns—rotating

07:55.760 --> 07:59.840
between TV appearances, radio interviews, and stump speeches about why they'd be the

07:59.840 --> 08:03.560
best person to put at the helm of the Salvadoran political system.

08:03.560 --> 08:08.500
Bukele, meanwhile, argued that the system itself was the problem—he promised to gut

08:08.500 --> 08:12.120
the establishment and its corruption, largely delivering this message through Facebook and

08:12.120 --> 08:15.840
Twitter, attaining skyrocketing engagement with each.

08:15.840 --> 08:20.100
His few physical campaign events more closely resembled parties, as he hosted dressed like

08:20.100 --> 08:24.180
a Silicon Valley CEO, not a suited presidential candidate.

08:24.180 --> 08:28.620
As election day neared, the polls trended increasingly towards his direction, and, so

08:28.620 --> 08:33.280
confident in his position, he didn't even show up to the debates, unwilling to even

08:33.280 --> 08:37.760
engage with the mainstream political candidacy system.

08:37.760 --> 08:40.540
It may have been risky, but it worked.

08:40.540 --> 08:47.520
The FMLN candidate attained 14.4% of the vote, the arena won 31.7%, and Naeib Bukele,

08:47.520 --> 08:55.240
the 37-year-old outsider, commanded 53.1%—such a decisive victory that the almost inevitable

08:55.240 --> 08:58.660
runoff wasn't even necessary.

08:58.660 --> 09:05.240
On June 1st, 2019, Bukele assumed office and became the 43rd president of the Republic

09:05.240 --> 09:07.740
of El Salvador.

09:07.740 --> 09:08.740
Change came quick.

09:08.860 --> 09:13.800
In the days that followed, Bukele unveiled his so-called territorial control plan—the

09:13.800 --> 09:16.900
plan that would transform El Salvador from one of the most dangerous countries in the

09:16.900 --> 09:21.280
world to one where people could simply go outside without fear.

09:21.280 --> 09:26.680
It reportedly had six phases, with a seventh to be implemented only if the rest didn't

09:26.680 --> 09:27.680
work.

09:27.680 --> 09:31.440
Each phase was only unveiled at its start, but the first started just 20 days into his

09:31.440 --> 09:33.720
presidency and was dubbed preparation.

09:34.300 --> 09:38.860
It comprised a surge of police and military into 12 of the country's most dangerous

09:38.860 --> 09:43.100
communities, ones that were effectively gang-held territory, along with initiating a state of

09:43.100 --> 09:47.200
emergency in the nation's prisons, prohibiting visitors and calls so that incarcerated gang

09:47.200 --> 09:49.460
leaders could no longer communicate.

09:49.460 --> 09:54.420
Essentially, the idea was to just start—to use the resources on hand to do what they

09:54.420 --> 09:57.820
could to start to fracture gang structures.

09:57.820 --> 10:00.020
The next phase was opportunity.

10:00.040 --> 10:03.880
Just as a way to foster public support before the more heavy-handed phases to come, this

10:03.880 --> 10:08.660
second step involved using a $91 million loan from the Central American Bank for Economic

10:08.660 --> 10:13.200
Integration to invest in community centers, skate parks, schools, and other services that

10:13.200 --> 10:17.040
would work to prevent young people from joining gangs in the first place.

10:17.040 --> 10:20.500
But phase three was where things got tricky.

10:20.500 --> 10:24.220
The name was modernization, and the idea was to buy the country's national security forces

10:24.220 --> 10:30.000
some $109 million in equipment—drones, helicopters, guns, everything they'd need to fight a

10:30.000 --> 10:32.580
an all-out war with the gangs.

10:32.580 --> 10:37.100
The only roadblock to implementing this was that the $109 million loan, again from the

10:37.100 --> 10:42.060
Central American Bank for Economic Integration, would have to be approved by the country's

10:42.060 --> 10:43.500
Legislative Assembly.

10:43.500 --> 10:48.800
The Legislative Assembly, however, was formed by an election in March 2018—almost a year

10:48.800 --> 10:52.820
before Bukele's election, long before he could influence an outcome.

10:52.820 --> 10:59.360
Therefore, the Legacy, Arena, and FMLN parties held 53 of the 84 seats—a firm majority,

10:59.360 --> 11:03.020
while Bukele's adoptive party, Ghana, had just 10.

11:03.020 --> 11:08.800
Essentially, in order to do anything, including get this $109 million loan, the president

11:08.800 --> 11:13.100
had to appeal to the lawmakers from the two parties he had just convinced the entire country

11:13.100 --> 11:15.820
were the problem in his campaign.

11:15.820 --> 11:20.740
Unsurprisingly, the parties pushed back, asking for more transparency on where funds would

11:20.740 --> 11:27.120
go, leaving the loan, and phase three of Bukele's crucial territorial control plan deadlocked.

11:27.120 --> 11:28.980
This is where things got iffy.

11:28.980 --> 11:34.240
Supposedly, the president invoked one of the powers granted to him by the Constitution—Article

11:34.240 --> 11:39.960
167, Part 7—which allowed the officeholder to convene an extraordinary session of the

11:39.960 --> 11:44.220
Legislative Assembly when, quote, the interests of the Republic demand it.

11:44.220 --> 11:49.360
While vague, many questioned whether the lack of approval of a loan constituted an extraordinary

11:49.360 --> 11:53.040
situation worthy of an emergency legislative session.

11:53.040 --> 11:56.600
While lawmakers squabbled over whether this was a legal maneuver, and therefore whether

11:56.600 --> 12:00.760
they would attend the Sunday session, Bukele pushed back, saying it was their constitutional

12:00.760 --> 12:06.320
requirement and threatening them by publicly reminding everyone of Article 87.

12:06.320 --> 12:10.520
Article 87 of the Constitution states that people have the right to mount an insurrection

12:10.520 --> 12:16.220
if lawmakers fail to follow the Constitution, and therefore, Bukele implicitly asked his

12:16.220 --> 12:22.080
supporters to come to the Legislative Assembly prepared to overthrow the government.

12:22.080 --> 12:27.280
So they did, surrounding the building, but ultimately, only twenty of eighty-four lawmakers

12:27.280 --> 12:31.800
showed up—far from the minimum needed to legally vote on legislation.

12:31.800 --> 12:36.000
Regardless, Bukele arrived, and not alone.

12:36.000 --> 12:40.000
Marching into the chamber with him were dozens of police and military personnel donned in

12:40.000 --> 12:43.300
military fatigues and armed with rifles.

12:43.300 --> 12:47.760
While they surrounded lawmakers, Bukele delivered a brief ten-minute speech demanding a return

12:47.760 --> 12:52.920
to what he considered constitutional order, furious that the majority of lawmakers disobeyed

12:52.920 --> 12:54.440
his dubious order.

12:54.440 --> 12:58.880
Now the key question was what this event actually was.

12:58.880 --> 13:04.200
Was it Bukele bringing in the army and police essentially as props—visual devices to convey

13:04.200 --> 13:08.000
the importance of passing the legislation that would better equip them, or was it a

13:08.000 --> 13:10.960
show of force, an implicit threat?

13:10.960 --> 13:15.400
A reminder to lawmakers that the guys with the guns were on his side, which they very

13:15.400 --> 13:19.880
much were, given the $109 million he was about to give them.

13:19.880 --> 13:24.360
While this series of events was quickly considered a constitutional crisis and critiqued the

13:24.360 --> 13:30.640
world over, distraction came quick as the COVID-19 virus reached El Salvador's borders.

13:30.640 --> 13:35.620
On March 21st, the President announced a mandatory nationwide lockdown, with violators subject

13:35.620 --> 13:39.620
to detainment in special pandemic containment centers.

13:39.620 --> 13:44.520
Almost immediately, potential legal issues arose—some seventy people were arrested

13:44.520 --> 13:48.880
in the early hours of March 22nd, before the details of the President's decree were

13:48.880 --> 13:55.160
even published—that is, arrested for violation of a law that wasn't even officially publicized.

13:55.160 --> 13:59.360
Others were arrested for not wearing masks, despite not yet being legally required, others

13:59.360 --> 14:04.440
still for traveling to jobs deemed essential by the decree itself—it was a constitutionally

14:04.440 --> 14:09.480
dubious law to begin with, but even then it was applied arbitrarily and with problematically

14:09.480 --> 14:10.640
generous interpretation.

14:11.520 --> 14:15.720
In a matter of weeks, the Supreme Court struck the decree down, saying that detainment without

14:15.720 --> 14:20.440
due process could only happen in response to a suspicion that a person might be infected,

14:20.440 --> 14:23.680
not simply for violation of the lockdown order.

14:23.680 --> 14:28.080
Of course, Bukele pushed back, building a loophole, saying that those found in violation

14:28.080 --> 14:32.640
of the lockdown would not be held for violation of the order itself, but rather under suspicion

14:32.640 --> 14:36.680
that they might be infected because they violated lockdown orders.

14:37.200 --> 14:43.280
Put another way, the Supreme Court made a ruling, then Bukele and the police just decided

14:43.280 --> 14:45.160
to ignore it.

14:45.160 --> 14:47.780
This storyline continued in 2021.

14:47.780 --> 14:52.760
On February 28th, the country voted in a new legislative assembly, and Nuevas Edeas, the

14:52.760 --> 14:56.560
new party founded by the President, decisively swept.

14:56.560 --> 14:58.080
This was no surprise.

14:58.080 --> 15:02.280
Through this all, Bukele was incredibly popular.

15:02.540 --> 15:06.960
Opinion polling hovered around 90% approval rating, making him one of, if not the most

15:06.960 --> 15:09.520
popular president in the world.

15:09.520 --> 15:15.440
This popularity translated to his party winning 56 of 84 seats—that's to say, they alone

15:15.440 --> 15:17.120
held a majority.

15:17.120 --> 15:22.200
No longer would Bukele have to face the opposition of the majority of the legislative assembly.

15:22.200 --> 15:25.680
No longer would he need to concede to FMLA and arena wishes.

15:25.680 --> 15:32.240
So just one major roadblock remained—the Supreme Court itself.

15:32.240 --> 15:36.480
Thanks to the new Nuevas Edeas majority, though, all it took was a vote.

15:36.480 --> 15:39.940
The President said the body was making arbitrary rulings that were impeding his ability to

15:39.940 --> 15:44.560
manage the pandemic, the national legislator voted to dismiss the five dissenting judges,

15:44.560 --> 15:48.280
and Bukele filled the bench with five new ones that would vote as he wished.

15:48.280 --> 15:56.580
Bukele now, by proxy, held all three branches of power—executive, legislative, and judicial—and

15:56.580 --> 16:02.040
with that he could do, well, just about anything he wanted.

16:02.040 --> 16:07.320
Well Salvador's weekend of March 25th through 27th, 2022 was tragic.

16:07.320 --> 16:10.880
Nobody's exactly sure why, but the gangs were mad.

16:10.880 --> 16:15.420
Many speculate in response to the breakdown of a secret truce between them and the government—special

16:15.420 --> 16:19.100
treatment in jail in exchange for relative peace on the streets.

16:19.100 --> 16:27.500
Whatever it was, some 87 seemingly random people were murdered, and Bukele was furious.

16:27.500 --> 16:32.260
Because of slow and steady progress, a small early sign of success of his territorial control

16:32.260 --> 16:36.380
plan were reversed in just one weekend.

16:36.380 --> 16:41.300
So he went to the Legislative Assembly, and they approved a 30-day so-called state of

16:41.300 --> 16:44.940
exception suspending constitutional rights.

16:44.940 --> 16:47.940
Police wouldn't have to tell people why they're being arrested, they wouldn't

16:47.940 --> 16:51.100
need to read them their rights, detainees wouldn't have a right to legal counsel,

16:51.100 --> 16:55.260
and they could be held for up to 15 days without seeing a judge.

16:55.260 --> 17:00.540
The state of exception paved the way for mass arbitrary detention, so that's exactly

17:00.540 --> 17:03.020
what came quick.

17:03.020 --> 17:07.300
Police and military swarmed gang strongholds, arresting any known members, but also arresting

17:07.300 --> 17:10.340
anyone who appeared that they could be in a gang.

17:10.340 --> 17:14.320
Tattoos, by themselves, were enough to get thrown in jail.

17:14.320 --> 17:17.880
Police were reportedly subject to daily arrest quotas and encountered little blowback for

17:17.880 --> 17:21.680
false arrests, pushing them to just arrest anyone that they could imagine being a gang

17:21.680 --> 17:24.960
member, regardless of facts or evidence.

17:24.960 --> 17:29.080
By midnight Sunday of that tragic weekend, some 600 people had been arrested.

17:29.080 --> 17:32.240
By the end of the week, 6,000.

17:32.240 --> 17:37.400
And now, one year on, with the state of exception having been renewed and renewed and renewed,

17:37.400 --> 17:41.440
nearly 70,000 suspected gang members have been detained.

17:41.440 --> 17:46.960
2% of the nation's adult population is behind bars, in overcrowded prisons stuffed three

17:46.960 --> 17:51.280
or four times beyond capacity, waiting to make their way through an overburdened judicial

17:51.280 --> 17:52.480
system.

17:52.480 --> 17:56.540
Members and fathers still search in desperation for their arrested children, unable to track

17:56.540 --> 18:01.000
them down in the system even after a year, but increasingly, they're being sent here,

18:01.000 --> 18:05.120
to the brand new Terrorism Confinement Center.

18:05.120 --> 18:09.460
This facility was built at breakneck pace once the gang roundups began, and opened for

18:09.460 --> 18:11.840
business in early 2023.

18:11.840 --> 18:15.640
It was introduced to the nation through a highly choreographed, scripted, and produced

18:15.640 --> 18:18.280
35-minute video tour with Bukele.

18:18.800 --> 18:22.640
Throughout, the video stressed the president's influence on the project, how his logic and

18:22.640 --> 18:27.160
smarts created a better system, and exhibited the scale of the security forces, thanks to

18:27.160 --> 18:31.840
Bukele, the quality of their equipment, thanks to Bukele, and the ultimate degree of control

18:31.840 --> 18:35.520
the government would have, thanks to Bukele.

18:35.520 --> 18:40.820
After all, the prison was capable of holding some 40,000 inmates, making it the largest

18:40.820 --> 18:47.840
prison in the world—a single facility capable of housing the population of a small country.

18:47.840 --> 18:50.880
The thing is, all of this worked.

18:50.880 --> 18:56.560
While in March 2022, the country averaged 4.8 homicides a day, a bump upwards over the

18:56.560 --> 19:03.240
year's average of 3.1, April, the first full month of the roundups, saw just 1.3.

19:03.240 --> 19:07.280
In May, the trend continued—just 0.5 homicides a day.

19:07.280 --> 19:13.680
In fact, since April 2022, not a single month encountered an average daily homicide count

19:13.680 --> 19:14.920
over one.

19:15.400 --> 19:20.320
While some question the exact validity of the data, the broad truth is undeniable—El

19:20.320 --> 19:23.960
Salvador is as safe as it's been in decades.

19:23.960 --> 19:29.840
For the first time in many residents' lifetimes, people can actually walk the streets, actually

19:29.840 --> 19:32.320
live life without fear.

19:32.320 --> 19:36.000
The feeling is freeing, life-changing.

19:36.000 --> 19:41.280
After decades of hopelessness, it's like living in a new nation, one with a better,

19:41.280 --> 19:43.520
brighter future.

19:43.520 --> 19:46.360
Bukele is as popular as he's ever been.

19:46.360 --> 19:50.400
The checks and balances of power may have been degraded, the judicial system may have

19:50.400 --> 19:56.280
broken down, thousands may be unjustly detained, but in the opinion of the vast majority of

19:56.280 --> 20:00.480
Salvadorans, the ends justify the means.

20:00.480 --> 20:06.000
Polling shows Bukele's approval rating still around 90%, making him still perhaps the most

20:06.000 --> 20:08.680
popular president in the world.

20:08.680 --> 20:12.480
Elsewhere, however, his image is different.

20:12.480 --> 20:17.080
Bukele has been condemned by just about anyone in the business of condemning—the United

20:17.080 --> 20:22.760
Nations, Human Rights Watch, the US State Department, international media—very few

20:22.760 --> 20:25.400
come to his support globally.

20:25.400 --> 20:29.360
All express concern for the backsliding from democracy.

20:29.360 --> 20:34.600
El Salvador is nine months away from its next presidential elections, and Bukele has announced

20:34.600 --> 20:35.840
he's running.

20:35.840 --> 20:41.480
This is despite what Article 152 of the country's constitution reads—quote, the following

20:41.480 --> 20:45.840
shall not be candidates for the president of the republic, he who has filled the presidency

20:45.840 --> 20:49.960
of the republic for more than six months, consecutive or not, during the period immediately

20:49.960 --> 20:55.040
prior to or within the last six months prior to the beginning of the presidential period.

20:55.040 --> 20:59.140
This line was always interpreted to mean that one could not be president for two consecutive

20:59.140 --> 21:06.260
terms—until 2021, when the newly overhauled, Bukele-appointed Supreme Court reversed course,

21:06.260 --> 21:09.840
saying that consecutive terms would be allowed.

21:09.840 --> 21:14.920
No legal justification was given—only that denying a second term to a popular president

21:14.920 --> 21:18.340
would be denying the will of the people.

21:18.340 --> 21:23.260
This is true—the people want Bukele to remain in power.

21:23.260 --> 21:27.360
He has seemingly solved the nation's biggest issue in a way that the people are supportive

21:27.360 --> 21:31.960
of—he's done the job he was democratically elected to do.

21:31.960 --> 21:37.120
Across every step in the process, he has retained the support of the people, even as he consolidated

21:37.120 --> 21:40.100
power across all three branches of government.

21:40.100 --> 21:44.760
He now has few, if any, legal checks on his power, considering he is able to modify or

21:44.760 --> 21:52.360
reinterpret the constitution as he pleases—he is essentially a democratically elected dictator.

21:52.360 --> 21:57.120
The dissonance between the opinion of El Salvador and that of the rest of the world has an air

21:57.120 --> 22:02.560
of paternalism to it—it feels like the developed world is telling El Salvador that it knows

22:02.560 --> 22:08.080
best—that the Salvadoran people are incapable of making decisions for themselves.

22:08.080 --> 22:12.200
This dynamic has been a feature of the nation's relationship with the US in particular for

22:12.200 --> 22:18.280
decades—the superpower has long meddled with domestic Salvadoran politics.

22:18.280 --> 22:23.020
Much of the supposed international concern is likely rooted in this—a condescending

22:23.020 --> 22:28.000
feeling of impossibility that the country truly figured something out on its own.

22:28.000 --> 22:33.120
But a distinct other part of the concern is likely rooted in the more objective, rational,

22:33.120 --> 22:38.060
emotionless analysis people who didn't live through decades of war-like state are able

22:38.060 --> 22:42.840
to undertake—the potentially more accurate understanding of the sacrifices being made

22:42.840 --> 22:46.960
to solve the crippling crisis of gang violence.

22:46.960 --> 22:52.280
Leaders come and go—even if Bukele is a perfect, benevolent dictator for life, he

22:52.280 --> 22:57.000
will eventually leave office, either democratically or through death.

22:57.000 --> 23:02.500
It is possible, even common, that checks and balances in a democratic system get in

23:02.500 --> 23:04.360
the way of progress.

23:04.360 --> 23:07.680
They make things slow, but they also make things methodical.

23:07.680 --> 23:12.520
It's through this process that decisions are properly vetted—it's a system of government

23:12.520 --> 23:17.200
designed to depend on the system itself, rather than any particular individual.

23:17.200 --> 23:22.960
So, it's a system of government that makes short-term sacrifices for the long-term gain.

23:22.960 --> 23:27.160
El Salvador, meanwhile, has flipped that on its head—it's putting all of its eggs

23:27.160 --> 23:32.480
in one basket, and making long-term sacrifices for short-term gain.

23:32.480 --> 23:33.960
Maybe the people are right.

23:33.960 --> 23:38.840
Maybe it's a sacrifice worth making to solve the number one issue holding the nation back.

23:38.840 --> 23:43.840
Or maybe the international observers are right—maybe their outside perspective is valuable, and

23:43.840 --> 23:47.240
the country truly is making a colossal mistake.

23:47.240 --> 23:52.820
But what sure is that, if it is a mistake, it's their mistake to make.

23:52.820 --> 23:57.960
As a sovereign nation, the Salvadoran people have the right to decide on their own, without

23:57.960 --> 24:03.860
international meddling, what they want to do, even if that means the democratic election

24:03.860 --> 24:06.120
of a dictator.

24:06.120 --> 24:10.060
The accessibility of smartphones these days has changed a lot, but one interesting thing

24:10.060 --> 24:13.440
I think it's changed most dramatically is what happens when we don't have something

24:13.440 --> 24:14.440
to do.

24:14.440 --> 24:18.680
If we're waiting for the subway, or to pick someone up, or for a class to start, we tend

24:18.680 --> 24:22.880
to now fill those moments by checking Twitter, or scrolling TikTok, or some other way of

24:22.880 --> 24:26.100
getting a quick hit of dopamine, because we tell ourselves that there's really nothing

24:26.100 --> 24:30.160
productive or meaningful we can do in five or ten minutes.

24:30.160 --> 24:34.240
But all those five or ten minutes really add up, so rather than wasting them, you can use

24:34.240 --> 24:35.800
them to learn something new.

24:35.800 --> 24:38.440
That's the idea behind our sponsor Brilliant.

24:38.440 --> 24:42.640
They're a STEM learning platform that designs these incredible interactive courses that

24:42.640 --> 24:47.140
take big, complex subjects like calculus, or physics, or computer science, and break

24:47.140 --> 24:51.620
them down into small bite-sized chunks that you can learn at your own pace.

24:51.620 --> 24:55.420
You might only learn a tiny bit of calculus in five minutes, but once you keep at it,

24:55.420 --> 24:59.660
filling all your free five minutes, it adds up into a meaningful understanding of a subject

24:59.660 --> 25:02.860
that might have previously seemed impossible to learn.

25:02.860 --> 25:06.500
I think it's incredible that they allow you to reach that satisfying feeling of achieving

25:06.500 --> 25:09.900
a challenging goal just by using the free time you already have.

25:09.900 --> 25:13.700
And truly anyone can learn through Brilliant no matter their educational background, as

25:13.700 --> 25:17.580
they have clear, concise explanations, and then let you learn by doing through interactive

25:17.580 --> 25:18.580
challenges.
