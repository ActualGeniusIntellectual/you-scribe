1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,400
The beginning of the rise didn't look like the beginning of a rise.

2
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:10,520
Not far from the tiny country of El Salvador's capital city, San Salvador, is a smaller city,

3
00:00:10,520 --> 00:00:11,680
Santa Tecla.

4
00:00:11,680 --> 00:00:15,960
And not far outside of Santa Tecla is the tiny coffee town of Nuevo Cuscatlan.

5
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:21,720
Though only a seven-mile, 12-kilometer drive from San Salvador, this 7,000-person city

6
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:23,920
feels far away from the busy capital.

7
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:30,280
And it was here in 2012 where 2,754 voters put their faith in a young, business-savvy

8
00:00:30,280 --> 00:00:35,260
political newcomer for mayor, defeating the Conservative Party opposition by the slimmest

9
00:00:35,260 --> 00:00:39,040
of margins—just 169 votes.

10
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:43,080
But such a narrow margin didn't dim the young, naive Bukele's ambition.

11
00:00:43,080 --> 00:00:48,700
While he ran with the leftist FMLN, Bukele's campaign from the very beginning focused less

12
00:00:48,700 --> 00:00:54,860
on party lines and more on purpose—a confident, energetic 30-year-old bent on snuffing out

13
00:00:54,860 --> 00:00:59,900
crime and corruption, and investing in education, infrastructure, and community development.

14
00:00:59,900 --> 00:01:06,340
Today, the marks of Bukele's time as mayor are hard to miss in Nuevo Cuscatlan.

15
00:01:06,340 --> 00:01:08,360
First came education.

16
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:11,900
Upon taking office, Bukele announced he'd forfeited salary so he could instead help

17
00:01:11,900 --> 00:01:14,100
fund a scholarship program.

18
00:01:14,100 --> 00:01:19,300
In that year, Nuevo Cuscatlan's illiteracy rate stood at about 15%.

19
00:01:19,300 --> 00:01:24,220
With the launch of a city-wide reading program, Salvadoran press celebrated that in 2015,

20
00:01:24,220 --> 00:01:28,980
the city was free of illiteracy, making it the third town in the department to reach

21
00:01:28,980 --> 00:01:32,980
the mark and moving it well ahead of the national average.

22
00:01:32,980 --> 00:01:36,780
The other metric that Bukele would go on to tout in future campaigns was that while he

23
00:01:36,780 --> 00:01:41,340
was in office, Nuevo Cuscatlan only saw a single homicide.

24
00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:45,520
While the exact number was disputed, the exceptionally low homicide rate was a major

25
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:50,460
point of pride, as the country has been fighting the violent and entrenched MS-13 and Barrio

26
00:01:50,460 --> 00:01:53,740
18 gangs since the end of its civil war in 1992.

27
00:01:53,740 --> 00:01:59,460
It's been an uphill battle against the hyper-violent and incredibly cruel gangs since Bukele was

28
00:01:59,460 --> 00:02:04,340
a teenager, so no matter how relatively safe the small town was to begin with, in a country

29
00:02:04,340 --> 00:02:09,420
with a legacy of gang violence, such a safety record was as much an accomplishment as education

30
00:02:09,420 --> 00:02:11,680
for the young mayor.

31
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:15,520
The other successes of Bukele's office were more tangible.

32
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:20,420
At the end of 2012, the city opened its first 24-7 medical clinic.

33
00:02:20,420 --> 00:02:24,100
Moving fast and not worried about how the city would pay for things, ground broke on

34
00:02:24,100 --> 00:02:27,820
a new library, and the city embarked on a multi-million dollar water project that would

35
00:02:27,820 --> 00:02:34,100
make drinking water available 24 hours a day rather than the meager 3 hours available previously.

36
00:02:34,100 --> 00:02:40,220
In three years, Nuevo Cuscatlon went from an unexceptional provincial town to exemplary.

37
00:02:40,220 --> 00:02:45,220
If politicians just took bold action, the town proved, things could change for the better

38
00:02:45,220 --> 00:02:46,220
of everyone.

39
00:02:46,220 --> 00:02:51,340
At the same pace that the city changed, the leader of the transformation went from unheard

40
00:02:51,340 --> 00:02:54,100
of to the next big thing.

41
00:02:54,100 --> 00:02:58,460
Prior to politics, Bukele's career had made stops in consulting and political advertising

42
00:02:58,460 --> 00:03:00,900
for the party he now represented.

43
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:05,200
Now as a politician himself, he made the most of his professional experience.

44
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:08,820
No good deed would go unclaimed or underreported.

45
00:03:08,820 --> 00:03:12,860
If infrastructure and education projects didn't sell Salvadorans on the small-town mayor standing

46
00:03:12,860 --> 00:03:16,860
as a politician for the people, perhaps the YouTube channel would.

47
00:03:16,860 --> 00:03:20,420
Here he posted clips of his interviews and debates that aired over local television.

48
00:03:20,420 --> 00:03:24,920
But he didn't stop at just getting his message out—use the platform to further an image

49
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:29,140
of a man firmly for the people, posting videos of him moving through the town, talking with

50
00:03:29,140 --> 00:03:34,340
kids, celebrating the launch of the medical center, and answering questions from the community.

51
00:03:34,340 --> 00:03:37,360
The brand building wasn't confined to the internet, either.

52
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:41,380
On everything that the mayor touched—the library, the hospital, the signs at city limits

53
00:03:41,380 --> 00:03:45,880
and construction sites alike, and the podiums from which he spoke—was now a light blue

54
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:50,980
M, which replaced the city's prior logo and highlighted the positive transformations

55
00:03:50,980 --> 00:03:55,000
directly connected to Nayib Bukele's term.

56
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,220
The project worked.

57
00:03:56,220 --> 00:04:00,440
He remade the city, and in doing so, built a personal image as a champion of the people

58
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:04,600
unafraid to greenlight big projects and take big swings.

59
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:08,940
While mayor for only a single three-year term, journalists now visiting years on are hard

60
00:04:08,940 --> 00:04:14,260
pressed to find a single person in Nuevo Cuscatlón that has a bad thing to say about him.

61
00:04:14,260 --> 00:04:18,800
While Bukele's time as mayor was transformative, it was also short.

62
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:23,100
Bigger things beckoned, as both he and the FMLN recognized that the new guy with bold

63
00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:28,700
ideas and a record so sterling had huge potential in a political environment dominated by aging

64
00:04:28,700 --> 00:04:32,440
voices of the civil war that had ended decades ago.

65
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:36,280
The logical progression was the mayor's office of the nation's capital—an office

66
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:41,120
that would garner more attention and potentially position the ascendant politician for a presidential

67
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:42,120
run.

68
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:46,800
While San Salvador dwarfs Nuevo Cuscatlón, Bukele took a similar approach.

69
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:51,960
He built a new library, reinvigorated old shopping markets, invested in infrastructure,

70
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:57,020
spent serious money, and signed off on glitzy vanity projects to ensure his image rose along

71
00:04:57,020 --> 00:04:58,860
with the city's.

72
00:04:58,860 --> 00:05:02,780
Salvadorans followed, and his popularity continued to rise.

73
00:05:02,780 --> 00:05:06,820
Nationally, though, other trends were on the rise in equal proportion.

74
00:05:06,820 --> 00:05:12,560
By the time Bukele took office, a truce between MS-13, BRIO-18, and the national government

75
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:14,340
had recently collapsed.

76
00:05:14,340 --> 00:05:19,160
In two years, homicide rates had more than doubled, and by 2015, the country was seeing

77
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:24,560
an average of 18 homicides a day, while its 103 homicides per 100,000 inhabitants had

78
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:27,100
ballooned to the world's worst rate.

79
00:05:27,100 --> 00:05:31,880
At the very same time, the nation's prisons were beginning to overflow as the federal

80
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:36,900
government leaned back into heavy-handed gang policies that threw more and more gang-affiliated

81
00:05:36,900 --> 00:05:39,240
Salvadorans behind bars.

82
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:44,740
From 2010 to 2016, the country's total prison population grew by more than 11,000, while

83
00:05:44,740 --> 00:05:48,180
the incarceration rate hit 579.

84
00:05:48,180 --> 00:05:54,320
They're outpacing any other Central American country, and nearing the top of the list globally.

85
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:58,360
While Nayib Bukele's name recognition was expanding, and image as a big-idea reformer

86
00:05:58,360 --> 00:06:02,160
was sharpening, the country was crumbling.

87
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:07,920
Gangs killed dispassionately, while the government arrested citizens indiscriminately.

88
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:11,440
Salvadorans were nothing short of desperate for change, as the threat of gang violence

89
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:15,600
now impacted every aspect of everyday life.

90
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:22,160
Old politicians and old policies just weren't enough anymore—a lane emerged.

91
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:28,080
For decades, El Salvador's politics effectively ran as a two-party system—it was FMLN,

92
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:29,620
or it was ARENA.

93
00:06:29,620 --> 00:06:33,740
No serious candidates would even consider running for high office without aligning themselves

94
00:06:33,740 --> 00:06:35,540
with one of the two.

95
00:06:35,540 --> 00:06:39,580
But despite surging popularity, Bukele's support from FMLN?

96
00:06:39,580 --> 00:06:44,580
His party was waning as he constantly broke rank and strayed from their platform, so in

97
00:06:44,580 --> 00:06:49,120
response, he was failing to get the votes of his own party members for some of his mayoral

98
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:52,800
ambitions—they became the barrier to his goals.

99
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:57,360
This quickly devolved into a vicious cycle of one criticizing the other, and vice versa,

100
00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:01,280
before finally, Bukele gave them an excuse to get rid of him.

101
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:06,680
FMLN officials alleged that he called their lawyer a bruja, a derogatory term that roughly

102
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:08,320
translates to witch.

103
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:13,480
This, and its violation of their ethics policies, was the reason given for his expulsion from

104
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:19,220
FMLN, but all understood that it was heavily, if not entirely, predicated by his increasingly

105
00:07:19,220 --> 00:07:22,920
distant and hostile relationship with the party.

106
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:28,540
The fallout with FMLN took Bukele off what appeared a predestined path towards the presidency.

107
00:07:28,540 --> 00:07:33,260
He clearly couldn't join ARENA, the opposition, and without either support, precedent suggested

108
00:07:33,260 --> 00:07:39,060
a successful presidential run was impossible—but regardless, he forged on.

109
00:07:39,060 --> 00:07:43,300
Wanting to form his own party, but unable to in time for the upcoming election, Bukele

110
00:07:43,300 --> 00:07:47,840
teamed up with the Grande Allianzade parle Unidad Nacional, meaning his incredibly longshot

111
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:50,800
presidential run could begin.

112
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:55,760
Both traditional nominees, backed by the traditional parties, ran traditional campaigns—rotating

113
00:07:55,760 --> 00:07:59,840
between TV appearances, radio interviews, and stump speeches about why they'd be the

114
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:03,560
best person to put at the helm of the Salvadoran political system.

115
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:08,500
Bukele, meanwhile, argued that the system itself was the problem—he promised to gut

116
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:12,120
the establishment and its corruption, largely delivering this message through Facebook and

117
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:15,840
Twitter, attaining skyrocketing engagement with each.

118
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:20,100
His few physical campaign events more closely resembled parties, as he hosted dressed like

119
00:08:20,100 --> 00:08:24,180
a Silicon Valley CEO, not a suited presidential candidate.

120
00:08:24,180 --> 00:08:28,620
As election day neared, the polls trended increasingly towards his direction, and, so

121
00:08:28,620 --> 00:08:33,280
confident in his position, he didn't even show up to the debates, unwilling to even

122
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:37,760
engage with the mainstream political candidacy system.

123
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:40,540
It may have been risky, but it worked.

124
00:08:40,540 --> 00:08:47,520
The FMLN candidate attained 14.4% of the vote, the arena won 31.7%, and Naeib Bukele,

125
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:55,240
the 37-year-old outsider, commanded 53.1%—such a decisive victory that the almost inevitable

126
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:58,660
runoff wasn't even necessary.

127
00:08:58,660 --> 00:09:05,240
On June 1st, 2019, Bukele assumed office and became the 43rd president of the Republic

128
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:07,740
of El Salvador.

129
00:09:07,740 --> 00:09:08,740
Change came quick.

130
00:09:08,860 --> 00:09:13,800
In the days that followed, Bukele unveiled his so-called territorial control plan—the

131
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:16,900
plan that would transform El Salvador from one of the most dangerous countries in the

132
00:09:16,900 --> 00:09:21,280
world to one where people could simply go outside without fear.

133
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:26,680
It reportedly had six phases, with a seventh to be implemented only if the rest didn't

134
00:09:26,680 --> 00:09:27,680
work.

135
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:31,440
Each phase was only unveiled at its start, but the first started just 20 days into his

136
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:33,720
presidency and was dubbed preparation.

137
00:09:34,300 --> 00:09:38,860
It comprised a surge of police and military into 12 of the country's most dangerous

138
00:09:38,860 --> 00:09:43,100
communities, ones that were effectively gang-held territory, along with initiating a state of

139
00:09:43,100 --> 00:09:47,200
emergency in the nation's prisons, prohibiting visitors and calls so that incarcerated gang

140
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:49,460
leaders could no longer communicate.

141
00:09:49,460 --> 00:09:54,420
Essentially, the idea was to just start—to use the resources on hand to do what they

142
00:09:54,420 --> 00:09:57,820
could to start to fracture gang structures.

143
00:09:57,820 --> 00:10:00,020
The next phase was opportunity.

144
00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:03,880
Just as a way to foster public support before the more heavy-handed phases to come, this

145
00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:08,660
second step involved using a $91 million loan from the Central American Bank for Economic

146
00:10:08,660 --> 00:10:13,200
Integration to invest in community centers, skate parks, schools, and other services that

147
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:17,040
would work to prevent young people from joining gangs in the first place.

148
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:20,500
But phase three was where things got tricky.

149
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:24,220
The name was modernization, and the idea was to buy the country's national security forces

150
00:10:24,220 --> 00:10:30,000
some $109 million in equipment—drones, helicopters, guns, everything they'd need to fight a

151
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,580
an all-out war with the gangs.

152
00:10:32,580 --> 00:10:37,100
The only roadblock to implementing this was that the $109 million loan, again from the

153
00:10:37,100 --> 00:10:42,060
Central American Bank for Economic Integration, would have to be approved by the country's

154
00:10:42,060 --> 00:10:43,500
Legislative Assembly.

155
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:48,800
The Legislative Assembly, however, was formed by an election in March 2018—almost a year

156
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:52,820
before Bukele's election, long before he could influence an outcome.

157
00:10:52,820 --> 00:10:59,360
Therefore, the Legacy, Arena, and FMLN parties held 53 of the 84 seats—a firm majority,

158
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:03,020
while Bukele's adoptive party, Ghana, had just 10.

159
00:11:03,020 --> 00:11:08,800
Essentially, in order to do anything, including get this $109 million loan, the president

160
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:13,100
had to appeal to the lawmakers from the two parties he had just convinced the entire country

161
00:11:13,100 --> 00:11:15,820
were the problem in his campaign.

162
00:11:15,820 --> 00:11:20,740
Unsurprisingly, the parties pushed back, asking for more transparency on where funds would

163
00:11:20,740 --> 00:11:27,120
go, leaving the loan, and phase three of Bukele's crucial territorial control plan deadlocked.

164
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:28,980
This is where things got iffy.

165
00:11:28,980 --> 00:11:34,240
Supposedly, the president invoked one of the powers granted to him by the Constitution—Article

166
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:39,960
167, Part 7—which allowed the officeholder to convene an extraordinary session of the

167
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:44,220
Legislative Assembly when, quote, the interests of the Republic demand it.

168
00:11:44,220 --> 00:11:49,360
While vague, many questioned whether the lack of approval of a loan constituted an extraordinary

169
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:53,040
situation worthy of an emergency legislative session.

170
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:56,600
While lawmakers squabbled over whether this was a legal maneuver, and therefore whether

171
00:11:56,600 --> 00:12:00,760
they would attend the Sunday session, Bukele pushed back, saying it was their constitutional

172
00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:06,320
requirement and threatening them by publicly reminding everyone of Article 87.

173
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:10,520
Article 87 of the Constitution states that people have the right to mount an insurrection

174
00:12:10,520 --> 00:12:16,220
if lawmakers fail to follow the Constitution, and therefore, Bukele implicitly asked his

175
00:12:16,220 --> 00:12:22,080
supporters to come to the Legislative Assembly prepared to overthrow the government.

176
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:27,280
So they did, surrounding the building, but ultimately, only twenty of eighty-four lawmakers

177
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:31,800
showed up—far from the minimum needed to legally vote on legislation.

178
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:36,000
Regardless, Bukele arrived, and not alone.

179
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:40,000
Marching into the chamber with him were dozens of police and military personnel donned in

180
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:43,300
military fatigues and armed with rifles.

181
00:12:43,300 --> 00:12:47,760
While they surrounded lawmakers, Bukele delivered a brief ten-minute speech demanding a return

182
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:52,920
to what he considered constitutional order, furious that the majority of lawmakers disobeyed

183
00:12:52,920 --> 00:12:54,440
his dubious order.

184
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:58,880
Now the key question was what this event actually was.

185
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:04,200
Was it Bukele bringing in the army and police essentially as props—visual devices to convey

186
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:08,000
the importance of passing the legislation that would better equip them, or was it a

187
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,960
show of force, an implicit threat?

188
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:15,400
A reminder to lawmakers that the guys with the guns were on his side, which they very

189
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:19,880
much were, given the $109 million he was about to give them.

190
00:13:19,880 --> 00:13:24,360
While this series of events was quickly considered a constitutional crisis and critiqued the

191
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:30,640
world over, distraction came quick as the COVID-19 virus reached El Salvador's borders.

192
00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:35,620
On March 21st, the President announced a mandatory nationwide lockdown, with violators subject

193
00:13:35,620 --> 00:13:39,620
to detainment in special pandemic containment centers.

194
00:13:39,620 --> 00:13:44,520
Almost immediately, potential legal issues arose—some seventy people were arrested

195
00:13:44,520 --> 00:13:48,880
in the early hours of March 22nd, before the details of the President's decree were

196
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:55,160
even published—that is, arrested for violation of a law that wasn't even officially publicized.

197
00:13:55,160 --> 00:13:59,360
Others were arrested for not wearing masks, despite not yet being legally required, others

198
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:04,440
still for traveling to jobs deemed essential by the decree itself—it was a constitutionally

199
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:09,480
dubious law to begin with, but even then it was applied arbitrarily and with problematically

200
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:10,640
generous interpretation.

201
00:14:11,520 --> 00:14:15,720
In a matter of weeks, the Supreme Court struck the decree down, saying that detainment without

202
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:20,440
due process could only happen in response to a suspicion that a person might be infected,

203
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:23,680
not simply for violation of the lockdown order.

204
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:28,080
Of course, Bukele pushed back, building a loophole, saying that those found in violation

205
00:14:28,080 --> 00:14:32,640
of the lockdown would not be held for violation of the order itself, but rather under suspicion

206
00:14:32,640 --> 00:14:36,680
that they might be infected because they violated lockdown orders.

207
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:43,280
Put another way, the Supreme Court made a ruling, then Bukele and the police just decided

208
00:14:43,280 --> 00:14:45,160
to ignore it.

209
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:47,780
This storyline continued in 2021.

210
00:14:47,780 --> 00:14:52,760
On February 28th, the country voted in a new legislative assembly, and Nuevas Edeas, the

211
00:14:52,760 --> 00:14:56,560
new party founded by the President, decisively swept.

212
00:14:56,560 --> 00:14:58,080
This was no surprise.

213
00:14:58,080 --> 00:15:02,280
Through this all, Bukele was incredibly popular.

214
00:15:02,540 --> 00:15:06,960
Opinion polling hovered around 90% approval rating, making him one of, if not the most

215
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:09,520
popular president in the world.

216
00:15:09,520 --> 00:15:15,440
This popularity translated to his party winning 56 of 84 seats—that's to say, they alone

217
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:17,120
held a majority.

218
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:22,200
No longer would Bukele have to face the opposition of the majority of the legislative assembly.

219
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:25,680
No longer would he need to concede to FMLA and arena wishes.

220
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:32,240
So just one major roadblock remained—the Supreme Court itself.

221
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:36,480
Thanks to the new Nuevas Edeas majority, though, all it took was a vote.

222
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:39,940
The President said the body was making arbitrary rulings that were impeding his ability to

223
00:15:39,940 --> 00:15:44,560
manage the pandemic, the national legislator voted to dismiss the five dissenting judges,

224
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:48,280
and Bukele filled the bench with five new ones that would vote as he wished.

225
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:56,580
Bukele now, by proxy, held all three branches of power—executive, legislative, and judicial—and

226
00:15:56,580 --> 00:16:02,040
with that he could do, well, just about anything he wanted.

227
00:16:02,040 --> 00:16:07,320
Well Salvador's weekend of March 25th through 27th, 2022 was tragic.

228
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:10,880
Nobody's exactly sure why, but the gangs were mad.

229
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:15,420
Many speculate in response to the breakdown of a secret truce between them and the government—special

230
00:16:15,420 --> 00:16:19,100
treatment in jail in exchange for relative peace on the streets.

231
00:16:19,100 --> 00:16:27,500
Whatever it was, some 87 seemingly random people were murdered, and Bukele was furious.

232
00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:32,260
Because of slow and steady progress, a small early sign of success of his territorial control

233
00:16:32,260 --> 00:16:36,380
plan were reversed in just one weekend.

234
00:16:36,380 --> 00:16:41,300
So he went to the Legislative Assembly, and they approved a 30-day so-called state of

235
00:16:41,300 --> 00:16:44,940
exception suspending constitutional rights.

236
00:16:44,940 --> 00:16:47,940
Police wouldn't have to tell people why they're being arrested, they wouldn't

237
00:16:47,940 --> 00:16:51,100
need to read them their rights, detainees wouldn't have a right to legal counsel,

238
00:16:51,100 --> 00:16:55,260
and they could be held for up to 15 days without seeing a judge.

239
00:16:55,260 --> 00:17:00,540
The state of exception paved the way for mass arbitrary detention, so that's exactly

240
00:17:00,540 --> 00:17:03,020
what came quick.

241
00:17:03,020 --> 00:17:07,300
Police and military swarmed gang strongholds, arresting any known members, but also arresting

242
00:17:07,300 --> 00:17:10,340
anyone who appeared that they could be in a gang.

243
00:17:10,340 --> 00:17:14,320
Tattoos, by themselves, were enough to get thrown in jail.

244
00:17:14,320 --> 00:17:17,880
Police were reportedly subject to daily arrest quotas and encountered little blowback for

245
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:21,680
false arrests, pushing them to just arrest anyone that they could imagine being a gang

246
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:24,960
member, regardless of facts or evidence.

247
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:29,080
By midnight Sunday of that tragic weekend, some 600 people had been arrested.

248
00:17:29,080 --> 00:17:32,240
By the end of the week, 6,000.

249
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:37,400
And now, one year on, with the state of exception having been renewed and renewed and renewed,

250
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:41,440
nearly 70,000 suspected gang members have been detained.

251
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:46,960
2% of the nation's adult population is behind bars, in overcrowded prisons stuffed three

252
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:51,280
or four times beyond capacity, waiting to make their way through an overburdened judicial

253
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:52,480
system.

254
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:56,540
Members and fathers still search in desperation for their arrested children, unable to track

255
00:17:56,540 --> 00:18:01,000
them down in the system even after a year, but increasingly, they're being sent here,

256
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:05,120
to the brand new Terrorism Confinement Center.

257
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:09,460
This facility was built at breakneck pace once the gang roundups began, and opened for

258
00:18:09,460 --> 00:18:11,840
business in early 2023.

259
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:15,640
It was introduced to the nation through a highly choreographed, scripted, and produced

260
00:18:15,640 --> 00:18:18,280
35-minute video tour with Bukele.

261
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:22,640
Throughout, the video stressed the president's influence on the project, how his logic and

262
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:27,160
smarts created a better system, and exhibited the scale of the security forces, thanks to

263
00:18:27,160 --> 00:18:31,840
Bukele, the quality of their equipment, thanks to Bukele, and the ultimate degree of control

264
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:35,520
the government would have, thanks to Bukele.

265
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:40,820
After all, the prison was capable of holding some 40,000 inmates, making it the largest

266
00:18:40,820 --> 00:18:47,840
prison in the world—a single facility capable of housing the population of a small country.

267
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:50,880
The thing is, all of this worked.

268
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:56,560
While in March 2022, the country averaged 4.8 homicides a day, a bump upwards over the

269
00:18:56,560 --> 00:19:03,240
year's average of 3.1, April, the first full month of the roundups, saw just 1.3.

270
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:07,280
In May, the trend continued—just 0.5 homicides a day.

271
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:13,680
In fact, since April 2022, not a single month encountered an average daily homicide count

272
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:14,920
over one.

273
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:20,320
While some question the exact validity of the data, the broad truth is undeniable—El

274
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:23,960
Salvador is as safe as it's been in decades.

275
00:19:23,960 --> 00:19:29,840
For the first time in many residents' lifetimes, people can actually walk the streets, actually

276
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:32,320
live life without fear.

277
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:36,000
The feeling is freeing, life-changing.

278
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:41,280
After decades of hopelessness, it's like living in a new nation, one with a better,

279
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:43,520
brighter future.

280
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:46,360
Bukele is as popular as he's ever been.

281
00:19:46,360 --> 00:19:50,400
The checks and balances of power may have been degraded, the judicial system may have

282
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:56,280
broken down, thousands may be unjustly detained, but in the opinion of the vast majority of

283
00:19:56,280 --> 00:20:00,480
Salvadorans, the ends justify the means.

284
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:06,000
Polling shows Bukele's approval rating still around 90%, making him still perhaps the most

285
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,680
popular president in the world.

286
00:20:08,680 --> 00:20:12,480
Elsewhere, however, his image is different.

287
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:17,080
Bukele has been condemned by just about anyone in the business of condemning—the United

288
00:20:17,080 --> 00:20:22,760
Nations, Human Rights Watch, the US State Department, international media—very few

289
00:20:22,760 --> 00:20:25,400
come to his support globally.

290
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:29,360
All express concern for the backsliding from democracy.

291
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:34,600
El Salvador is nine months away from its next presidential elections, and Bukele has announced

292
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:35,840
he's running.

293
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:41,480
This is despite what Article 152 of the country's constitution reads—quote, the following

294
00:20:41,480 --> 00:20:45,840
shall not be candidates for the president of the republic, he who has filled the presidency

295
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:49,960
of the republic for more than six months, consecutive or not, during the period immediately

296
00:20:49,960 --> 00:20:55,040
prior to or within the last six months prior to the beginning of the presidential period.

297
00:20:55,040 --> 00:20:59,140
This line was always interpreted to mean that one could not be president for two consecutive

298
00:20:59,140 --> 00:21:06,260
terms—until 2021, when the newly overhauled, Bukele-appointed Supreme Court reversed course,

299
00:21:06,260 --> 00:21:09,840
saying that consecutive terms would be allowed.

300
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:14,920
No legal justification was given—only that denying a second term to a popular president

301
00:21:14,920 --> 00:21:18,340
would be denying the will of the people.

302
00:21:18,340 --> 00:21:23,260
This is true—the people want Bukele to remain in power.

303
00:21:23,260 --> 00:21:27,360
He has seemingly solved the nation's biggest issue in a way that the people are supportive

304
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:31,960
of—he's done the job he was democratically elected to do.

305
00:21:31,960 --> 00:21:37,120
Across every step in the process, he has retained the support of the people, even as he consolidated

306
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:40,100
power across all three branches of government.

307
00:21:40,100 --> 00:21:44,760
He now has few, if any, legal checks on his power, considering he is able to modify or

308
00:21:44,760 --> 00:21:52,360
reinterpret the constitution as he pleases—he is essentially a democratically elected dictator.

309
00:21:52,360 --> 00:21:57,120
The dissonance between the opinion of El Salvador and that of the rest of the world has an air

310
00:21:57,120 --> 00:22:02,560
of paternalism to it—it feels like the developed world is telling El Salvador that it knows

311
00:22:02,560 --> 00:22:08,080
best—that the Salvadoran people are incapable of making decisions for themselves.

312
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:12,200
This dynamic has been a feature of the nation's relationship with the US in particular for

313
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:18,280
decades—the superpower has long meddled with domestic Salvadoran politics.

314
00:22:18,280 --> 00:22:23,020
Much of the supposed international concern is likely rooted in this—a condescending

315
00:22:23,020 --> 00:22:28,000
feeling of impossibility that the country truly figured something out on its own.

316
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:33,120
But a distinct other part of the concern is likely rooted in the more objective, rational,

317
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:38,060
emotionless analysis people who didn't live through decades of war-like state are able

318
00:22:38,060 --> 00:22:42,840
to undertake—the potentially more accurate understanding of the sacrifices being made

319
00:22:42,840 --> 00:22:46,960
to solve the crippling crisis of gang violence.

320
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:52,280
Leaders come and go—even if Bukele is a perfect, benevolent dictator for life, he

321
00:22:52,280 --> 00:22:57,000
will eventually leave office, either democratically or through death.

322
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:02,500
It is possible, even common, that checks and balances in a democratic system get in

323
00:23:02,500 --> 00:23:04,360
the way of progress.

324
00:23:04,360 --> 00:23:07,680
They make things slow, but they also make things methodical.

325
00:23:07,680 --> 00:23:12,520
It's through this process that decisions are properly vetted—it's a system of government

326
00:23:12,520 --> 00:23:17,200
designed to depend on the system itself, rather than any particular individual.

327
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:22,960
So, it's a system of government that makes short-term sacrifices for the long-term gain.

328
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:27,160
El Salvador, meanwhile, has flipped that on its head—it's putting all of its eggs

329
00:23:27,160 --> 00:23:32,480
in one basket, and making long-term sacrifices for short-term gain.

330
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:33,960
Maybe the people are right.

331
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:38,840
Maybe it's a sacrifice worth making to solve the number one issue holding the nation back.

332
00:23:38,840 --> 00:23:43,840
Or maybe the international observers are right—maybe their outside perspective is valuable, and

333
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:47,240
the country truly is making a colossal mistake.

334
00:23:47,240 --> 00:23:52,820
But what sure is that, if it is a mistake, it's their mistake to make.

335
00:23:52,820 --> 00:23:57,960
As a sovereign nation, the Salvadoran people have the right to decide on their own, without

336
00:23:57,960 --> 00:24:03,860
international meddling, what they want to do, even if that means the democratic election

337
00:24:03,860 --> 00:24:06,120
of a dictator.

338
00:24:06,120 --> 00:24:10,060
The accessibility of smartphones these days has changed a lot, but one interesting thing

339
00:24:10,060 --> 00:24:13,440
I think it's changed most dramatically is what happens when we don't have something

340
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:14,440
to do.

341
00:24:14,440 --> 00:24:18,680
If we're waiting for the subway, or to pick someone up, or for a class to start, we tend

342
00:24:18,680 --> 00:24:22,880
to now fill those moments by checking Twitter, or scrolling TikTok, or some other way of

343
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:26,100
getting a quick hit of dopamine, because we tell ourselves that there's really nothing

344
00:24:26,100 --> 00:24:30,160
productive or meaningful we can do in five or ten minutes.

345
00:24:30,160 --> 00:24:34,240
But all those five or ten minutes really add up, so rather than wasting them, you can use

346
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:35,800
them to learn something new.

347
00:24:35,800 --> 00:24:38,440
That's the idea behind our sponsor Brilliant.

348
00:24:38,440 --> 00:24:42,640
They're a STEM learning platform that designs these incredible interactive courses that

349
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:47,140
take big, complex subjects like calculus, or physics, or computer science, and break

350
00:24:47,140 --> 00:24:51,620
them down into small bite-sized chunks that you can learn at your own pace.

351
00:24:51,620 --> 00:24:55,420
You might only learn a tiny bit of calculus in five minutes, but once you keep at it,

352
00:24:55,420 --> 00:24:59,660
filling all your free five minutes, it adds up into a meaningful understanding of a subject

353
00:24:59,660 --> 00:25:02,860
that might have previously seemed impossible to learn.

354
00:25:02,860 --> 00:25:06,500
I think it's incredible that they allow you to reach that satisfying feeling of achieving

355
00:25:06,500 --> 00:25:09,900
a challenging goal just by using the free time you already have.

356
00:25:09,900 --> 00:25:13,700
And truly anyone can learn through Brilliant no matter their educational background, as

357
00:25:13,700 --> 00:25:17,580
they have clear, concise explanations, and then let you learn by doing through interactive

358
00:25:17,580 --> 00:25:18,580
challenges.

00:25:18,580 --> 00:25:23,580
