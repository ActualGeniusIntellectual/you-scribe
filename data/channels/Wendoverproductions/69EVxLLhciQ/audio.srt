3
00:00:07,840 --> 00:00:09,560
This is Hong Kong.

4
00:00:09,560 --> 00:00:15,180
177 years ago, as the conclusion of the First Opium War, the United Kingdom and China signed

5
00:00:15,180 --> 00:00:16,280
a treaty that read,

6
00:00:16,280 --> 00:00:20,520
His Majesty, the Emperor of China, cedes to Her Majesty, the Queen of Great Britain, etc.,

7
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:24,680
the Island of Hong Kong, to be possessed in perpetuity by Her Britannic Majesty, Her Heirs

8
00:00:24,680 --> 00:00:28,800
and Successors, and to be governed by such laws and regulations as Her Majesty, the Queen

9
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:31,940
of Great Britain, etc., shall see fit to direct.

10
00:00:31,940 --> 00:00:35,300
With that, the British Empire got just a little bit bigger.

11
00:00:35,300 --> 00:00:40,460
The population of the island in that year was reported as 7,450.

12
00:00:40,460 --> 00:00:44,720
Nobody would have imagined what this island, dotted only by a few fishing villages, would

13
00:00:44,720 --> 00:00:45,720
become.

14
00:00:45,720 --> 00:00:48,600
Fast forward 18 years—another Opium War, another treaty.

15
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:51,800
It has now been agreed between the governments of Great Britain and China that the limits

16
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:54,400
of British territory shall be enlarged under lease.

17
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:57,600
Fast forward 38 years—the third and final agreement.

18
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:00,560
It has now been agreed between the governments of Great Britain and China that the limits

19
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:04,320
of British territory shall be enlarged under lease to the extent indicated generally on

20
00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:05,420
the annexed map.

21
00:01:05,420 --> 00:01:08,320
The term of this lease shall be 99 years.

22
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:12,480
99 years—as good as forever to the signers of this agreement.

23
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:16,600
This forever, though, had an end, and that end was 1997.

24
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:18,000
That didn't matter at first, though.

25
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,840
Hong Kong grew and grew and grew and grew into one of the richest, most powerful, and

26
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:24,920
most developed cities in the world.

27
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:27,780
It became the business center of Asia.

28
00:01:27,780 --> 00:01:33,560
It thrived under a strong capitalistic economic model but then, as forever drew near, a question

29
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:35,400
loomed over the city.

30
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:37,560
Was it really going back to China?

31
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:41,760
That's the question British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher had for Deng Xiaoping, China's

32
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:45,100
paramount leader, when she visited Beijing in 1982.

33
00:01:45,100 --> 00:01:46,860
The answer was effectively yes.

34
00:01:46,860 --> 00:01:49,640
In China's eyes, Hong Kong would return in 1997.

35
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:54,400
Now, it's important to note that it is only the lease of this portion, the new territories,

36
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:56,480
that expired in 1997.

37
00:01:56,480 --> 00:02:00,240
Kowloon and Hong Kong Island were seated in perpetuity which meant that according to the

38
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:04,000
terms of the agreements, Britain could have kept these areas.

39
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:08,120
Hong Kong as a whole, though, is small enough already, and the city had very much grown

40
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:12,160
into the new territories so it was decided early on that these negotiations were effectively

41
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:16,240
over what would happen to Hong Kong as a whole—it would be too impractical to divide up the

42
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:18,800
quite integrated city into different parts.

43
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:23,120
Eventually, after years of back and forth, a decision was reached in the last days of

44
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:24,120
1984.

45
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:28,940
Hong Kong would go back to China in 1997, but the Hong Kong way of life, with a capitalistic

46
00:02:28,940 --> 00:02:33,380
system and democratic government, would remain untouched for 50 years after the handover

47
00:02:33,380 --> 00:02:35,120
until 2047.

48
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:38,920
Hong Kong would become a semi-autonomous region of China.

49
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:40,840
With that, a clock started ticking.

50
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:45,500
There were 12 years, 6 months, and 12 days left until Hong Kong would change from British

51
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:46,680
to Chinese.

52
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:50,880
In those 12 and a half years, an enormous amount of planning and preparation was conducted

53
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:54,960
in order to carry out one of the only modern instances of the change in sovereignty of

54
00:02:54,960 --> 00:03:00,120
a city as large and influential as Hong Kong between two countries so different.

55
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:04,880
In fact, this was the first time a capitalistic territory had been handed over to a communist

56
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:05,880
state.

57
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:09,540
Conducting such a monumental shift was no easy feat.

58
00:03:09,540 --> 00:03:14,100
As such a significant business hub, Hong Kong-based companies were some of the first to make their

59
00:03:14,100 --> 00:03:15,280
handover plans.

60
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:20,100
There was, at the time, a lot of uncertainty about what would happen to the territory post-handover

61
00:03:20,140 --> 00:03:23,340
so many companies restructured to be legally registered elsewhere.

62
00:03:23,340 --> 00:03:26,980
Jardine Matheson, for example, one of the most prominent Hong Kong companies, moved

63
00:03:26,980 --> 00:03:30,980
their legal headquarters to Bermuda and their stock listing to Singapore even if their de-facto

64
00:03:30,980 --> 00:03:32,980
headquarters remained in Hong Kong.

65
00:03:32,980 --> 00:03:37,580
HSBC, which stands for the Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation, legally transferred many

66
00:03:37,580 --> 00:03:40,280
of their assets to their London office as well.

67
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:43,620
Companies typically didn't leave Hong Kong but rather set themselves up to be able to

68
00:03:43,620 --> 00:03:45,900
in case the handover went badly.

69
00:03:45,900 --> 00:03:49,860
In addition to companies, individual people made their handover plans as well.

70
00:03:50,620 --> 00:03:52,940
Now, opinions were mixed on this grand change.

71
00:03:52,940 --> 00:03:57,140
There was no one resounding view on whether the change in sovereignty was good or bad

72
00:03:57,140 --> 00:03:58,220
for Hong Kong.

73
00:03:58,220 --> 00:04:03,020
When surveyed in 1991, for example, about 57% of respondents were confident in Hong

74
00:04:03,020 --> 00:04:05,640
Kong's future while 35% were not.

75
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:10,320
Of those 35% who were not, many chose to move elsewhere and there began a period of mass

76
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:15,980
migration away from Hong Kong—a staggering 800,000 people left in the 12 and a half years

77
00:04:15,980 --> 00:04:18,620
leading up to the handover, according to estimates.

78
00:04:18,620 --> 00:04:22,780
Morewhelmingly, Hongkongers settled in Australia or Canada, likely because they were commonwealth

79
00:04:22,780 --> 00:04:24,760
countries, and the US.

80
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:30,360
Over 110,000 Hongkongers settled in Vancouver alone, a city still shaped by this wave of

81
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:31,660
mass migration.

82
00:04:31,660 --> 00:04:36,320
Many though, were just migrating temporarily for a few years to gain Canadian citizenship.

83
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:40,240
With this, like companies, they would have a way to get out of Hong Kong if things went

84
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:41,240
wrong.

85
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:45,860
Hongkongers could also get a special type of passport that was first introduced in 1985

86
00:04:45,860 --> 00:04:47,220
in the lead up to the handover.

87
00:04:47,220 --> 00:04:52,040
It was called the British National Overseas Passport and it works differently to a British

88
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:53,040
passport.

89
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:57,860
It gives visa-free access to 118 countries, fewer than a full British passport, and noticeably,

90
00:04:57,860 --> 00:05:01,680
does not give the right for someone to live and work in the UK.

91
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:05,380
Holders can only stay in the UK for up to six months and are not considered European

92
00:05:05,380 --> 00:05:06,780
Union citizens.

93
00:05:06,780 --> 00:05:10,500
These passports are still valid today and can be renewed for anyone born in Hong Kong

94
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:11,500
prior to the handover.

95
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:16,040
There was a huge and increasing rush of people at registration for these passports in the

96
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:19,720
years leading up to the handover with millions overall being issued.

97
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:23,580
While today's Hong Kong Special Administrative Region passport is more powerful in terms

98
00:05:23,580 --> 00:05:27,680
of visa-free access to countries, holders of British National Overseas Passports, as

99
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:32,340
British Nationals, get the same consular assistance and protection as a full British citizen in

100
00:05:32,340 --> 00:05:36,300
case a holder runs into trouble outside the UK, at least on paper.

101
00:05:36,300 --> 00:05:40,500
For this reason, hundreds of thousands still renew these passports to this day despite

102
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:41,900
the redundancy.

103
00:05:41,900 --> 00:05:45,340
As the date of the handover drew nearer, though, the government started focusing on the changes

104
00:05:45,340 --> 00:05:46,720
they needed to make.

105
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:50,800
Of course there were enormous changes to the entire structure of government, the laws,

106
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:55,080
the legal system, and more, but there were also small changes to be made, plenty of which

107
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:56,080
were visual.

108
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:58,480
For example, they needed a new flag.

109
00:05:58,480 --> 00:06:02,020
The previous flag, which included the British Union Jack, certainly wouldn't work under

110
00:06:02,020 --> 00:06:03,020
Chinese rule.

111
00:06:03,020 --> 00:06:07,200
A contest was held with 7,000 submissions but all were rejected.

112
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:11,260
In the end, one of the contest judges, architect Tao Ho, came up with this design which was

113
00:06:11,260 --> 00:06:14,560
eventually approved to be the new flag in April, 1990.

114
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:17,820
But there were plenty of other signs of Britishness in Hong Kong.

115
00:06:17,820 --> 00:06:21,360
The emblem of the police force included a crown and the word royal so that had to be

116
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:22,360
changed too.

117
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:25,740
They eventually came up with a new design that swapped out the British symbols and replaced

118
00:06:25,740 --> 00:06:29,200
the uniforms at a cost of $2.8 million US dollars.

119
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:33,180
The word royal, in fact, was removed from basically every institution from the Royal

120
00:06:33,180 --> 00:06:36,060
Hong Kong Jockey Club to the Royal Hong Kong Golf Club.

121
00:06:36,060 --> 00:06:39,400
They just became the Hong Kong Jockey Club and the Hong Kong Golf Club.

122
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:41,300
There was just plenty of sign changing city-wide.

123
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:45,620
Hong Kong's post boxes were another symbol that needed altering.

124
00:06:45,620 --> 00:06:49,340
Most at the time were imported from Britain and therefore were the iconic red pillar box

125
00:06:49,340 --> 00:06:51,400
style featuring a crown.

126
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:55,340
Most of these were progressively removed with all being painted green to distinguish them

127
00:06:55,340 --> 00:06:56,860
from the UK's.

128
00:06:56,860 --> 00:07:01,140
As the days of British rule dwindled, focus shifted towards planning the actual event

129
00:07:01,140 --> 00:07:02,140
of the handover.

130
00:07:02,140 --> 00:07:07,720
Now, this event was of enormous significance to Hong Kong, China, Britain, and the world.

131
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:12,280
The BBC described it as, the biggest planned event they had ever covered.

132
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:15,760
What was known was that the event would be centered around midnight on the night of July

133
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:20,220
30th, 1997—the exact moment of the reversion to Chinese rule.

134
00:07:20,220 --> 00:07:24,500
As you can imagine, the two governments, Britain and China, each crucially desiring the best

135
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:29,580
possible optics for their side, negotiated relentlessly on the details of the event.

136
00:07:29,580 --> 00:07:34,640
For example, there was a long dispute on which flags would raise and lower in which order.

137
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:38,220
Britain wanted the British Hong Kong flag lowered first, followed by the Union Jack,

138
00:07:38,220 --> 00:07:40,960
to signify a dignified retreat from the colony.

139
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:44,880
China wanted the Chinese flag to be raised at the same time as the British flag was lowered

140
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:48,160
to signify an instantaneous resumption in sovereignty.

141
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:52,200
China also wanted the new Hong Kong flag to replace the British Hong Kong flag on the

142
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:53,400
same flagpole.

143
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:57,180
In the end, a compromise was reached to lower the Union Jack and the British Hong Kong flags

144
00:07:57,180 --> 00:08:01,240
at the same time, then raise the Chinese and new Hong Kong flags at the same time.

145
00:08:01,640 --> 00:08:05,400
There were other subtle, negotiated details such as the convention center, where the event

146
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:08,980
was held, was designed to have chairs facing south towards the stage.

147
00:08:08,980 --> 00:08:12,640
For this event, though, a stage was built on the north side so the attendees would look

148
00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:15,800
north, possibly for the symbolism of looking towards China.

149
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:20,760
Eventually, though, the meticulously negotiated invites went out to thousands of dignitaries

150
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:22,520
and VIPs.

151
00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:26,960
One week before the handover, the Royal Yacht Britannia sailed into Victoria Harbor and moored

152
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:27,960
to the pier.

153
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:31,040
It would serve as home to Prince Charles, who would represent the United Kingdom, during

154
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:32,120
the handover.

155
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:36,440
Over the next week, the majority of the handover's VIPs, including Prince Charles, then British

156
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:40,000
Prime Minister Tony Blair, former British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, American

157
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:44,240
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, and plenty more arrived in the city.

158
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:48,900
That week was a week of lasts—the last meeting of the Hong Kong Executive Council, the last

159
00:08:48,900 --> 00:08:52,720
changing of the guard to the British garrison, and then it was just the last day of Britain

160
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:56,400
in Hong Kong—Monday, June 30th, 1997.

161
00:08:56,400 --> 00:09:00,700
The process kicked off with a 4pm ceremony at Government House marking the final departure

162
00:09:00,700 --> 00:09:05,000
of Chris Patten, the last governor of Hong Kong, from what had been his official residence

163
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,900
for the previous five years.

164
00:09:06,900 --> 00:09:11,020
At 4.30, the first of his goodbyes was completed and he was driven to the Royal Yacht Britannia

165
00:09:11,020 --> 00:09:13,140
to join the rest of the British delegation.

166
00:09:13,140 --> 00:09:18,860
Shortly after, around 5.30, a chartered Air China 747 touched down at Kai Tak Airport

167
00:09:18,860 --> 00:09:23,540
carrying Chinese President Zhang Zemin, Premier Li Peng, and the rest of the Chinese delegation.

168
00:09:23,540 --> 00:09:29,020
Then, at 7.11 pm, the sun set on British Hong Kong for the final time.

169
00:09:29,020 --> 00:09:33,100
Minutes later, the 4,000 lucky individuals invited to the handover ceremony gathered

170
00:09:33,100 --> 00:09:35,500
at the convention center for a cocktail reception.

171
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:40,020
At 8 pm, an enormous fireworks display started in Victoria Harbor and then at 9 the handover

172
00:09:40,020 --> 00:09:43,460
guests sat down for their banquet dinner at the convention center.

173
00:09:43,460 --> 00:09:47,820
Simultaneously, around 500 Chinese People Liberation Army troops were allowed over the

174
00:09:47,820 --> 00:09:51,420
border to move into position and ensure that there would never be a lapse in the defense

175
00:09:51,420 --> 00:09:52,620
of Hong Kong.

176
00:09:52,620 --> 00:09:56,380
At 30 minutes to midnight, dinner was over and the ceremony began.

177
00:09:56,380 --> 00:10:00,180
Prince Charles gave remarks bidding the territory goodbye on behalf of the Queen and then about

178
00:10:00,180 --> 00:10:04,100
a minute to midnight, God Save the Queen was played, and the British and British Hong Kong

179
00:10:04,100 --> 00:10:08,180
flags were slowly and simultaneously lowered—just as negotiated.

180
00:10:08,180 --> 00:10:13,500
Then, in an instant, when the clock struck midnight, Hong Kong was Chinese again—just

181
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:15,000
like that.

182
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:18,660
The new Hong Kong and Chinese flags were then raised to the Chinese national anthem and

183
00:10:18,660 --> 00:10:21,220
Chinese President Zhang Zemin gave a speech.

184
00:10:21,220 --> 00:10:24,840
Fifteen minutes past midnight, Prince Charles and Governor Chris Patten boarded the Royal

185
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:28,560
Yacht Britannia and sailed out of Victoria Harbor for the final time.

186
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:32,120
Prime Minister Tony Blair and most of the rest of the British delegation then boarded

187
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:36,960
a Chartered British Airways 777 at Kai Tak Airport which swiftly took off bound for London

188
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:37,960
Heathrow.

189
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:42,240
By 3.30 am, all the British forces tasked with guarding Hong Kong until midnight had

190
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:46,580
boarded flights and taken off from the Chinese territory and with that, Britain was gone

191
00:10:46,580 --> 00:10:50,060
from Hong Kong for good.

192
00:10:50,060 --> 00:10:54,760
Whenever I talk about Dashling, the password manager, on here, people have one major question—what

193
00:10:54,760 --> 00:10:56,560
if Dashling gets hacked?

194
00:10:56,560 --> 00:11:00,200
The idea behind Dashling is that you store complicated passwords, ones you could never

195
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:04,920
remember, unique to each site you use on it so that if one of the sites you use gets compromised,

196
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:06,680
all your other accounts are safe.

197
00:11:06,680 --> 00:11:10,880
How Dashling works is that you remember one master key to get in that Dashling doesn't

198
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:15,160
store, only you have it, so that even if Dashling was compromised, a hacker would still have

199
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:19,200
to go one by one through each user account and figure out the password out through brute

200
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:22,960
force—something that would take heaps of time and never be worth it compared to other

201
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:23,960
targets.

202
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:28,320
Dashling is so safe and, since it autofills each of your secure passwords for you on your

203
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:30,960
devices, it's also quite convenient.
