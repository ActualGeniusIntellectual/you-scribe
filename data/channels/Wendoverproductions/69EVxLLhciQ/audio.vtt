00:07.840 --> 00:09.560
This is Hong Kong.

00:09.560 --> 00:15.180
177 years ago, as the conclusion of the First Opium War, the United Kingdom and China signed

00:15.180 --> 00:16.280
a treaty that read,

00:16.280 --> 00:20.520
His Majesty, the Emperor of China, cedes to Her Majesty, the Queen of Great Britain, etc.,

00:20.520 --> 00:24.680
the Island of Hong Kong, to be possessed in perpetuity by Her Britannic Majesty, Her Heirs

00:24.680 --> 00:28.800
and Successors, and to be governed by such laws and regulations as Her Majesty, the Queen

00:28.800 --> 00:31.940
of Great Britain, etc., shall see fit to direct.

00:31.940 --> 00:35.300
With that, the British Empire got just a little bit bigger.

00:35.300 --> 00:40.460
The population of the island in that year was reported as 7,450.

00:40.460 --> 00:44.720
Nobody would have imagined what this island, dotted only by a few fishing villages, would

00:44.720 --> 00:45.720
become.

00:45.720 --> 00:48.600
Fast forward 18 years—another Opium War, another treaty.

00:48.600 --> 00:51.800
It has now been agreed between the governments of Great Britain and China that the limits

00:51.800 --> 00:54.400
of British territory shall be enlarged under lease.

00:54.400 --> 00:57.600
Fast forward 38 years—the third and final agreement.

00:57.600 --> 01:00.560
It has now been agreed between the governments of Great Britain and China that the limits

01:00.560 --> 01:04.320
of British territory shall be enlarged under lease to the extent indicated generally on

01:04.320 --> 01:05.420
the annexed map.

01:05.420 --> 01:08.320
The term of this lease shall be 99 years.

01:08.320 --> 01:12.480
99 years—as good as forever to the signers of this agreement.

01:12.480 --> 01:16.600
This forever, though, had an end, and that end was 1997.

01:16.600 --> 01:18.000
That didn't matter at first, though.

01:18.000 --> 01:22.840
Hong Kong grew and grew and grew and grew into one of the richest, most powerful, and

01:22.840 --> 01:24.920
most developed cities in the world.

01:24.920 --> 01:27.780
It became the business center of Asia.

01:27.780 --> 01:33.560
It thrived under a strong capitalistic economic model but then, as forever drew near, a question

01:33.560 --> 01:35.400
loomed over the city.

01:35.400 --> 01:37.560
Was it really going back to China?

01:37.560 --> 01:41.760
That's the question British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher had for Deng Xiaoping, China's

01:41.760 --> 01:45.100
paramount leader, when she visited Beijing in 1982.

01:45.100 --> 01:46.860
The answer was effectively yes.

01:46.860 --> 01:49.640
In China's eyes, Hong Kong would return in 1997.

01:49.640 --> 01:54.400
Now, it's important to note that it is only the lease of this portion, the new territories,

01:54.400 --> 01:56.480
that expired in 1997.

01:56.480 --> 02:00.240
Kowloon and Hong Kong Island were seated in perpetuity which meant that according to the

02:00.240 --> 02:04.000
terms of the agreements, Britain could have kept these areas.

02:04.000 --> 02:08.120
Hong Kong as a whole, though, is small enough already, and the city had very much grown

02:08.120 --> 02:12.160
into the new territories so it was decided early on that these negotiations were effectively

02:12.160 --> 02:16.240
over what would happen to Hong Kong as a whole—it would be too impractical to divide up the

02:16.240 --> 02:18.800
quite integrated city into different parts.

02:18.800 --> 02:23.120
Eventually, after years of back and forth, a decision was reached in the last days of

02:23.120 --> 02:24.120
1984.

02:24.120 --> 02:28.940
Hong Kong would go back to China in 1997, but the Hong Kong way of life, with a capitalistic

02:28.940 --> 02:33.380
system and democratic government, would remain untouched for 50 years after the handover

02:33.380 --> 02:35.120
until 2047.

02:35.120 --> 02:38.920
Hong Kong would become a semi-autonomous region of China.

02:38.920 --> 02:40.840
With that, a clock started ticking.

02:40.840 --> 02:45.500
There were 12 years, 6 months, and 12 days left until Hong Kong would change from British

02:45.500 --> 02:46.680
to Chinese.

02:46.680 --> 02:50.880
In those 12 and a half years, an enormous amount of planning and preparation was conducted

02:50.880 --> 02:54.960
in order to carry out one of the only modern instances of the change in sovereignty of

02:54.960 --> 03:00.120
a city as large and influential as Hong Kong between two countries so different.

03:00.120 --> 03:04.880
In fact, this was the first time a capitalistic territory had been handed over to a communist

03:04.880 --> 03:05.880
state.

03:05.880 --> 03:09.540
Conducting such a monumental shift was no easy feat.

03:09.540 --> 03:14.100
As such a significant business hub, Hong Kong-based companies were some of the first to make their

03:14.100 --> 03:15.280
handover plans.

03:15.280 --> 03:20.100
There was, at the time, a lot of uncertainty about what would happen to the territory post-handover

03:20.140 --> 03:23.340
so many companies restructured to be legally registered elsewhere.

03:23.340 --> 03:26.980
Jardine Matheson, for example, one of the most prominent Hong Kong companies, moved

03:26.980 --> 03:30.980
their legal headquarters to Bermuda and their stock listing to Singapore even if their de-facto

03:30.980 --> 03:32.980
headquarters remained in Hong Kong.

03:32.980 --> 03:37.580
HSBC, which stands for the Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation, legally transferred many

03:37.580 --> 03:40.280
of their assets to their London office as well.

03:40.280 --> 03:43.620
Companies typically didn't leave Hong Kong but rather set themselves up to be able to

03:43.620 --> 03:45.900
in case the handover went badly.

03:45.900 --> 03:49.860
In addition to companies, individual people made their handover plans as well.

03:50.620 --> 03:52.940
Now, opinions were mixed on this grand change.

03:52.940 --> 03:57.140
There was no one resounding view on whether the change in sovereignty was good or bad

03:57.140 --> 03:58.220
for Hong Kong.

03:58.220 --> 04:03.020
When surveyed in 1991, for example, about 57% of respondents were confident in Hong

04:03.020 --> 04:05.640
Kong's future while 35% were not.

04:05.640 --> 04:10.320
Of those 35% who were not, many chose to move elsewhere and there began a period of mass

04:10.320 --> 04:15.980
migration away from Hong Kong—a staggering 800,000 people left in the 12 and a half years

04:15.980 --> 04:18.620
leading up to the handover, according to estimates.

04:18.620 --> 04:22.780
Morewhelmingly, Hongkongers settled in Australia or Canada, likely because they were commonwealth

04:22.780 --> 04:24.760
countries, and the US.

04:24.760 --> 04:30.360
Over 110,000 Hongkongers settled in Vancouver alone, a city still shaped by this wave of

04:30.360 --> 04:31.660
mass migration.

04:31.660 --> 04:36.320
Many though, were just migrating temporarily for a few years to gain Canadian citizenship.

04:36.320 --> 04:40.240
With this, like companies, they would have a way to get out of Hong Kong if things went

04:40.240 --> 04:41.240
wrong.

04:41.240 --> 04:45.860
Hongkongers could also get a special type of passport that was first introduced in 1985

04:45.860 --> 04:47.220
in the lead up to the handover.

04:47.220 --> 04:52.040
It was called the British National Overseas Passport and it works differently to a British

04:52.040 --> 04:53.040
passport.

04:53.040 --> 04:57.860
It gives visa-free access to 118 countries, fewer than a full British passport, and noticeably,

04:57.860 --> 05:01.680
does not give the right for someone to live and work in the UK.

05:01.680 --> 05:05.380
Holders can only stay in the UK for up to six months and are not considered European

05:05.380 --> 05:06.780
Union citizens.

05:06.780 --> 05:10.500
These passports are still valid today and can be renewed for anyone born in Hong Kong

05:10.500 --> 05:11.500
prior to the handover.

05:11.500 --> 05:16.040
There was a huge and increasing rush of people at registration for these passports in the

05:16.040 --> 05:19.720
years leading up to the handover with millions overall being issued.

05:19.720 --> 05:23.580
While today's Hong Kong Special Administrative Region passport is more powerful in terms

05:23.580 --> 05:27.680
of visa-free access to countries, holders of British National Overseas Passports, as

05:27.680 --> 05:32.340
British Nationals, get the same consular assistance and protection as a full British citizen in

05:32.340 --> 05:36.300
case a holder runs into trouble outside the UK, at least on paper.

05:36.300 --> 05:40.500
For this reason, hundreds of thousands still renew these passports to this day despite

05:40.500 --> 05:41.900
the redundancy.

05:41.900 --> 05:45.340
As the date of the handover drew nearer, though, the government started focusing on the changes

05:45.340 --> 05:46.720
they needed to make.

05:46.720 --> 05:50.800
Of course there were enormous changes to the entire structure of government, the laws,

05:50.800 --> 05:55.080
the legal system, and more, but there were also small changes to be made, plenty of which

05:55.080 --> 05:56.080
were visual.

05:56.080 --> 05:58.480
For example, they needed a new flag.

05:58.480 --> 06:02.020
The previous flag, which included the British Union Jack, certainly wouldn't work under

06:02.020 --> 06:03.020
Chinese rule.

06:03.020 --> 06:07.200
A contest was held with 7,000 submissions but all were rejected.

06:07.200 --> 06:11.260
In the end, one of the contest judges, architect Tao Ho, came up with this design which was

06:11.260 --> 06:14.560
eventually approved to be the new flag in April, 1990.

06:14.560 --> 06:17.820
But there were plenty of other signs of Britishness in Hong Kong.

06:17.820 --> 06:21.360
The emblem of the police force included a crown and the word royal so that had to be

06:21.360 --> 06:22.360
changed too.

06:22.360 --> 06:25.740
They eventually came up with a new design that swapped out the British symbols and replaced

06:25.740 --> 06:29.200
the uniforms at a cost of $2.8 million US dollars.

06:29.200 --> 06:33.180
The word royal, in fact, was removed from basically every institution from the Royal

06:33.180 --> 06:36.060
Hong Kong Jockey Club to the Royal Hong Kong Golf Club.

06:36.060 --> 06:39.400
They just became the Hong Kong Jockey Club and the Hong Kong Golf Club.

06:39.400 --> 06:41.300
There was just plenty of sign changing city-wide.

06:42.080 --> 06:45.620
Hong Kong's post boxes were another symbol that needed altering.

06:45.620 --> 06:49.340
Most at the time were imported from Britain and therefore were the iconic red pillar box

06:49.340 --> 06:51.400
style featuring a crown.

06:51.400 --> 06:55.340
Most of these were progressively removed with all being painted green to distinguish them

06:55.340 --> 06:56.860
from the UK's.

06:56.860 --> 07:01.140
As the days of British rule dwindled, focus shifted towards planning the actual event

07:01.140 --> 07:02.140
of the handover.

07:02.140 --> 07:07.720
Now, this event was of enormous significance to Hong Kong, China, Britain, and the world.

07:07.720 --> 07:12.280
The BBC described it as, the biggest planned event they had ever covered.

07:12.280 --> 07:15.760
What was known was that the event would be centered around midnight on the night of July

07:15.760 --> 07:20.220
30th, 1997—the exact moment of the reversion to Chinese rule.

07:20.220 --> 07:24.500
As you can imagine, the two governments, Britain and China, each crucially desiring the best

07:24.500 --> 07:29.580
possible optics for their side, negotiated relentlessly on the details of the event.

07:29.580 --> 07:34.640
For example, there was a long dispute on which flags would raise and lower in which order.

07:34.640 --> 07:38.220
Britain wanted the British Hong Kong flag lowered first, followed by the Union Jack,

07:38.220 --> 07:40.960
to signify a dignified retreat from the colony.

07:40.960 --> 07:44.880
China wanted the Chinese flag to be raised at the same time as the British flag was lowered

07:44.880 --> 07:48.160
to signify an instantaneous resumption in sovereignty.

07:48.160 --> 07:52.200
China also wanted the new Hong Kong flag to replace the British Hong Kong flag on the

07:52.200 --> 07:53.400
same flagpole.

07:53.400 --> 07:57.180
In the end, a compromise was reached to lower the Union Jack and the British Hong Kong flags

07:57.180 --> 08:01.240
at the same time, then raise the Chinese and new Hong Kong flags at the same time.

08:01.640 --> 08:05.400
There were other subtle, negotiated details such as the convention center, where the event

08:05.400 --> 08:08.980
was held, was designed to have chairs facing south towards the stage.

08:08.980 --> 08:12.640
For this event, though, a stage was built on the north side so the attendees would look

08:12.640 --> 08:15.800
north, possibly for the symbolism of looking towards China.

08:15.800 --> 08:20.760
Eventually, though, the meticulously negotiated invites went out to thousands of dignitaries

08:20.760 --> 08:22.520
and VIPs.

08:22.520 --> 08:26.960
One week before the handover, the Royal Yacht Britannia sailed into Victoria Harbor and moored

08:26.960 --> 08:27.960
to the pier.

08:27.960 --> 08:31.040
It would serve as home to Prince Charles, who would represent the United Kingdom, during

08:31.040 --> 08:32.120
the handover.

08:32.120 --> 08:36.440
Over the next week, the majority of the handover's VIPs, including Prince Charles, then British

08:36.440 --> 08:40.000
Prime Minister Tony Blair, former British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, American

08:40.000 --> 08:44.240
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, and plenty more arrived in the city.

08:44.240 --> 08:48.900
That week was a week of lasts—the last meeting of the Hong Kong Executive Council, the last

08:48.900 --> 08:52.720
changing of the guard to the British garrison, and then it was just the last day of Britain

08:52.720 --> 08:56.400
in Hong Kong—Monday, June 30th, 1997.

08:56.400 --> 09:00.700
The process kicked off with a 4pm ceremony at Government House marking the final departure

09:00.700 --> 09:05.000
of Chris Patten, the last governor of Hong Kong, from what had been his official residence

09:05.000 --> 09:06.900
for the previous five years.

09:06.900 --> 09:11.020
At 4.30, the first of his goodbyes was completed and he was driven to the Royal Yacht Britannia

09:11.020 --> 09:13.140
to join the rest of the British delegation.

09:13.140 --> 09:18.860
Shortly after, around 5.30, a chartered Air China 747 touched down at Kai Tak Airport

09:18.860 --> 09:23.540
carrying Chinese President Zhang Zemin, Premier Li Peng, and the rest of the Chinese delegation.

09:23.540 --> 09:29.020
Then, at 7.11 pm, the sun set on British Hong Kong for the final time.

09:29.020 --> 09:33.100
Minutes later, the 4,000 lucky individuals invited to the handover ceremony gathered

09:33.100 --> 09:35.500
at the convention center for a cocktail reception.

09:35.500 --> 09:40.020
At 8 pm, an enormous fireworks display started in Victoria Harbor and then at 9 the handover

09:40.020 --> 09:43.460
guests sat down for their banquet dinner at the convention center.

09:43.460 --> 09:47.820
Simultaneously, around 500 Chinese People Liberation Army troops were allowed over the

09:47.820 --> 09:51.420
border to move into position and ensure that there would never be a lapse in the defense

09:51.420 --> 09:52.620
of Hong Kong.

09:52.620 --> 09:56.380
At 30 minutes to midnight, dinner was over and the ceremony began.

09:56.380 --> 10:00.180
Prince Charles gave remarks bidding the territory goodbye on behalf of the Queen and then about

10:00.180 --> 10:04.100
a minute to midnight, God Save the Queen was played, and the British and British Hong Kong

10:04.100 --> 10:08.180
flags were slowly and simultaneously lowered—just as negotiated.

10:08.180 --> 10:13.500
Then, in an instant, when the clock struck midnight, Hong Kong was Chinese again—just

10:13.500 --> 10:15.000
like that.

10:15.000 --> 10:18.660
The new Hong Kong and Chinese flags were then raised to the Chinese national anthem and

10:18.660 --> 10:21.220
Chinese President Zhang Zemin gave a speech.

10:21.220 --> 10:24.840
Fifteen minutes past midnight, Prince Charles and Governor Chris Patten boarded the Royal

10:24.840 --> 10:28.560
Yacht Britannia and sailed out of Victoria Harbor for the final time.

10:28.560 --> 10:32.120
Prime Minister Tony Blair and most of the rest of the British delegation then boarded

10:32.120 --> 10:36.960
a Chartered British Airways 777 at Kai Tak Airport which swiftly took off bound for London

10:36.960 --> 10:37.960
Heathrow.

10:37.960 --> 10:42.240
By 3.30 am, all the British forces tasked with guarding Hong Kong until midnight had

10:42.240 --> 10:46.580
boarded flights and taken off from the Chinese territory and with that, Britain was gone

10:46.580 --> 10:50.060
from Hong Kong for good.

10:50.060 --> 10:54.760
Whenever I talk about Dashling, the password manager, on here, people have one major question—what

10:54.760 --> 10:56.560
if Dashling gets hacked?

10:56.560 --> 11:00.200
The idea behind Dashling is that you store complicated passwords, ones you could never

11:00.200 --> 11:04.920
remember, unique to each site you use on it so that if one of the sites you use gets compromised,

11:04.920 --> 11:06.680
all your other accounts are safe.

11:06.680 --> 11:10.880
How Dashling works is that you remember one master key to get in that Dashling doesn't

11:10.880 --> 11:15.160
store, only you have it, so that even if Dashling was compromised, a hacker would still have

11:15.160 --> 11:19.200
to go one by one through each user account and figure out the password out through brute

11:19.200 --> 11:22.960
force—something that would take heaps of time and never be worth it compared to other

11:22.960 --> 11:23.960
targets.

11:24.160 --> 11:28.320
Dashling is so safe and, since it autofills each of your secure passwords for you on your

11:28.320 --> 11:30.960
devices, it's also quite convenient.

11:30.960 --> 11:35.560
