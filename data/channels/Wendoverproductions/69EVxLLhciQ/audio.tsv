7840	9560	This is Hong Kong.
9560	15180	177 years ago, as the conclusion of the First Opium War, the United Kingdom and China signed
15180	16280	a treaty that read,
16280	20520	His Majesty, the Emperor of China, cedes to Her Majesty, the Queen of Great Britain, etc.,
20520	24680	the Island of Hong Kong, to be possessed in perpetuity by Her Britannic Majesty, Her Heirs
24680	28800	and Successors, and to be governed by such laws and regulations as Her Majesty, the Queen
28800	31940	of Great Britain, etc., shall see fit to direct.
31940	35300	With that, the British Empire got just a little bit bigger.
35300	40460	The population of the island in that year was reported as 7,450.
40460	44720	Nobody would have imagined what this island, dotted only by a few fishing villages, would
44720	45720	become.
45720	48600	Fast forward 18 years—another Opium War, another treaty.
48600	51800	It has now been agreed between the governments of Great Britain and China that the limits
51800	54400	of British territory shall be enlarged under lease.
54400	57600	Fast forward 38 years—the third and final agreement.
57600	60560	It has now been agreed between the governments of Great Britain and China that the limits
60560	64320	of British territory shall be enlarged under lease to the extent indicated generally on
64320	65420	the annexed map.
65420	68320	The term of this lease shall be 99 years.
68320	72480	99 years—as good as forever to the signers of this agreement.
72480	76600	This forever, though, had an end, and that end was 1997.
76600	78000	That didn't matter at first, though.
78000	82840	Hong Kong grew and grew and grew and grew into one of the richest, most powerful, and
82840	84920	most developed cities in the world.
84920	87780	It became the business center of Asia.
87780	93560	It thrived under a strong capitalistic economic model but then, as forever drew near, a question
93560	95400	loomed over the city.
95400	97560	Was it really going back to China?
97560	101760	That's the question British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher had for Deng Xiaoping, China's
101760	105100	paramount leader, when she visited Beijing in 1982.
105100	106860	The answer was effectively yes.
106860	109640	In China's eyes, Hong Kong would return in 1997.
109640	114400	Now, it's important to note that it is only the lease of this portion, the new territories,
114400	116480	that expired in 1997.
116480	120240	Kowloon and Hong Kong Island were seated in perpetuity which meant that according to the
120240	124000	terms of the agreements, Britain could have kept these areas.
124000	128120	Hong Kong as a whole, though, is small enough already, and the city had very much grown
128120	132160	into the new territories so it was decided early on that these negotiations were effectively
132160	136240	over what would happen to Hong Kong as a whole—it would be too impractical to divide up the
136240	138800	quite integrated city into different parts.
138800	143120	Eventually, after years of back and forth, a decision was reached in the last days of
143120	144120	1984.
144120	148940	Hong Kong would go back to China in 1997, but the Hong Kong way of life, with a capitalistic
148940	153380	system and democratic government, would remain untouched for 50 years after the handover
153380	155120	until 2047.
155120	158920	Hong Kong would become a semi-autonomous region of China.
158920	160840	With that, a clock started ticking.
160840	165500	There were 12 years, 6 months, and 12 days left until Hong Kong would change from British
165500	166680	to Chinese.
166680	170880	In those 12 and a half years, an enormous amount of planning and preparation was conducted
170880	174960	in order to carry out one of the only modern instances of the change in sovereignty of
174960	180120	a city as large and influential as Hong Kong between two countries so different.
180120	184880	In fact, this was the first time a capitalistic territory had been handed over to a communist
184880	185880	state.
185880	189540	Conducting such a monumental shift was no easy feat.
189540	194100	As such a significant business hub, Hong Kong-based companies were some of the first to make their
194100	195280	handover plans.
195280	200100	There was, at the time, a lot of uncertainty about what would happen to the territory post-handover
200140	203340	so many companies restructured to be legally registered elsewhere.
203340	206980	Jardine Matheson, for example, one of the most prominent Hong Kong companies, moved
206980	210980	their legal headquarters to Bermuda and their stock listing to Singapore even if their de-facto
210980	212980	headquarters remained in Hong Kong.
212980	217580	HSBC, which stands for the Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation, legally transferred many
217580	220280	of their assets to their London office as well.
220280	223620	Companies typically didn't leave Hong Kong but rather set themselves up to be able to
223620	225900	in case the handover went badly.
225900	229860	In addition to companies, individual people made their handover plans as well.
230620	232940	Now, opinions were mixed on this grand change.
232940	237140	There was no one resounding view on whether the change in sovereignty was good or bad
237140	238220	for Hong Kong.
238220	243020	When surveyed in 1991, for example, about 57% of respondents were confident in Hong
243020	245640	Kong's future while 35% were not.
245640	250320	Of those 35% who were not, many chose to move elsewhere and there began a period of mass
250320	255980	migration away from Hong Kong—a staggering 800,000 people left in the 12 and a half years
255980	258620	leading up to the handover, according to estimates.
258620	262780	Morewhelmingly, Hongkongers settled in Australia or Canada, likely because they were commonwealth
262780	264760	countries, and the US.
264760	270360	Over 110,000 Hongkongers settled in Vancouver alone, a city still shaped by this wave of
270360	271660	mass migration.
271660	276320	Many though, were just migrating temporarily for a few years to gain Canadian citizenship.
276320	280240	With this, like companies, they would have a way to get out of Hong Kong if things went
280240	281240	wrong.
281240	285860	Hongkongers could also get a special type of passport that was first introduced in 1985
285860	287220	in the lead up to the handover.
287220	292040	It was called the British National Overseas Passport and it works differently to a British
292040	293040	passport.
293040	297860	It gives visa-free access to 118 countries, fewer than a full British passport, and noticeably,
297860	301680	does not give the right for someone to live and work in the UK.
301680	305380	Holders can only stay in the UK for up to six months and are not considered European
305380	306780	Union citizens.
306780	310500	These passports are still valid today and can be renewed for anyone born in Hong Kong
310500	311500	prior to the handover.
311500	316040	There was a huge and increasing rush of people at registration for these passports in the
316040	319720	years leading up to the handover with millions overall being issued.
319720	323580	While today's Hong Kong Special Administrative Region passport is more powerful in terms
323580	327680	of visa-free access to countries, holders of British National Overseas Passports, as
327680	332340	British Nationals, get the same consular assistance and protection as a full British citizen in
332340	336300	case a holder runs into trouble outside the UK, at least on paper.
336300	340500	For this reason, hundreds of thousands still renew these passports to this day despite
340500	341900	the redundancy.
341900	345340	As the date of the handover drew nearer, though, the government started focusing on the changes
345340	346720	they needed to make.
346720	350800	Of course there were enormous changes to the entire structure of government, the laws,
350800	355080	the legal system, and more, but there were also small changes to be made, plenty of which
355080	356080	were visual.
356080	358480	For example, they needed a new flag.
358480	362020	The previous flag, which included the British Union Jack, certainly wouldn't work under
362020	363020	Chinese rule.
363020	367200	A contest was held with 7,000 submissions but all were rejected.
367200	371260	In the end, one of the contest judges, architect Tao Ho, came up with this design which was
371260	374560	eventually approved to be the new flag in April, 1990.
374560	377820	But there were plenty of other signs of Britishness in Hong Kong.
377820	381360	The emblem of the police force included a crown and the word royal so that had to be
381360	382360	changed too.
382360	385740	They eventually came up with a new design that swapped out the British symbols and replaced
385740	389200	the uniforms at a cost of $2.8 million US dollars.
389200	393180	The word royal, in fact, was removed from basically every institution from the Royal
393180	396060	Hong Kong Jockey Club to the Royal Hong Kong Golf Club.
396060	399400	They just became the Hong Kong Jockey Club and the Hong Kong Golf Club.
399400	401300	There was just plenty of sign changing city-wide.
402080	405620	Hong Kong's post boxes were another symbol that needed altering.
405620	409340	Most at the time were imported from Britain and therefore were the iconic red pillar box
409340	411400	style featuring a crown.
411400	415340	Most of these were progressively removed with all being painted green to distinguish them
415340	416860	from the UK's.
416860	421140	As the days of British rule dwindled, focus shifted towards planning the actual event
421140	422140	of the handover.
422140	427720	Now, this event was of enormous significance to Hong Kong, China, Britain, and the world.
427720	432280	The BBC described it as, the biggest planned event they had ever covered.
432280	435760	What was known was that the event would be centered around midnight on the night of July
435760	440220	30th, 1997—the exact moment of the reversion to Chinese rule.
440220	444500	As you can imagine, the two governments, Britain and China, each crucially desiring the best
444500	449580	possible optics for their side, negotiated relentlessly on the details of the event.
449580	454640	For example, there was a long dispute on which flags would raise and lower in which order.
454640	458220	Britain wanted the British Hong Kong flag lowered first, followed by the Union Jack,
458220	460960	to signify a dignified retreat from the colony.
460960	464880	China wanted the Chinese flag to be raised at the same time as the British flag was lowered
464880	468160	to signify an instantaneous resumption in sovereignty.
468160	472200	China also wanted the new Hong Kong flag to replace the British Hong Kong flag on the
472200	473400	same flagpole.
473400	477180	In the end, a compromise was reached to lower the Union Jack and the British Hong Kong flags
477180	481240	at the same time, then raise the Chinese and new Hong Kong flags at the same time.
481640	485400	There were other subtle, negotiated details such as the convention center, where the event
485400	488980	was held, was designed to have chairs facing south towards the stage.
488980	492640	For this event, though, a stage was built on the north side so the attendees would look
492640	495800	north, possibly for the symbolism of looking towards China.
495800	500760	Eventually, though, the meticulously negotiated invites went out to thousands of dignitaries
500760	502520	and VIPs.
502520	506960	One week before the handover, the Royal Yacht Britannia sailed into Victoria Harbor and moored
506960	507960	to the pier.
507960	511040	It would serve as home to Prince Charles, who would represent the United Kingdom, during
511040	512120	the handover.
512120	516440	Over the next week, the majority of the handover's VIPs, including Prince Charles, then British
516440	520000	Prime Minister Tony Blair, former British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, American
520000	524240	Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, and plenty more arrived in the city.
524240	528900	That week was a week of lasts—the last meeting of the Hong Kong Executive Council, the last
528900	532720	changing of the guard to the British garrison, and then it was just the last day of Britain
532720	536400	in Hong Kong—Monday, June 30th, 1997.
536400	540700	The process kicked off with a 4pm ceremony at Government House marking the final departure
540700	545000	of Chris Patten, the last governor of Hong Kong, from what had been his official residence
545000	546900	for the previous five years.
546900	551020	At 4.30, the first of his goodbyes was completed and he was driven to the Royal Yacht Britannia
551020	553140	to join the rest of the British delegation.
553140	558860	Shortly after, around 5.30, a chartered Air China 747 touched down at Kai Tak Airport
558860	563540	carrying Chinese President Zhang Zemin, Premier Li Peng, and the rest of the Chinese delegation.
563540	569020	Then, at 7.11 pm, the sun set on British Hong Kong for the final time.
569020	573100	Minutes later, the 4,000 lucky individuals invited to the handover ceremony gathered
573100	575500	at the convention center for a cocktail reception.
575500	580020	At 8 pm, an enormous fireworks display started in Victoria Harbor and then at 9 the handover
580020	583460	guests sat down for their banquet dinner at the convention center.
583460	587820	Simultaneously, around 500 Chinese People Liberation Army troops were allowed over the
587820	591420	border to move into position and ensure that there would never be a lapse in the defense
591420	592620	of Hong Kong.
592620	596380	At 30 minutes to midnight, dinner was over and the ceremony began.
596380	600180	Prince Charles gave remarks bidding the territory goodbye on behalf of the Queen and then about
600180	604100	a minute to midnight, God Save the Queen was played, and the British and British Hong Kong
604100	608180	flags were slowly and simultaneously lowered—just as negotiated.
608180	613500	Then, in an instant, when the clock struck midnight, Hong Kong was Chinese again—just
613500	615000	like that.
615000	618660	The new Hong Kong and Chinese flags were then raised to the Chinese national anthem and
618660	621220	Chinese President Zhang Zemin gave a speech.
621220	624840	Fifteen minutes past midnight, Prince Charles and Governor Chris Patten boarded the Royal
624840	628560	Yacht Britannia and sailed out of Victoria Harbor for the final time.
628560	632120	Prime Minister Tony Blair and most of the rest of the British delegation then boarded
632120	636960	a Chartered British Airways 777 at Kai Tak Airport which swiftly took off bound for London
636960	637960	Heathrow.
637960	642240	By 3.30 am, all the British forces tasked with guarding Hong Kong until midnight had
642240	646580	boarded flights and taken off from the Chinese territory and with that, Britain was gone
646580	650060	from Hong Kong for good.
650060	654760	Whenever I talk about Dashling, the password manager, on here, people have one major question—what
654760	656560	if Dashling gets hacked?
656560	660200	The idea behind Dashling is that you store complicated passwords, ones you could never
660200	664920	remember, unique to each site you use on it so that if one of the sites you use gets compromised,
664920	666680	all your other accounts are safe.
666680	670880	How Dashling works is that you remember one master key to get in that Dashling doesn't
670880	675160	store, only you have it, so that even if Dashling was compromised, a hacker would still have
675160	679200	to go one by one through each user account and figure out the password out through brute
679200	682960	force—something that would take heaps of time and never be worth it compared to other
682960	683960	targets.
684160	688320	Dashling is so safe and, since it autofills each of your secure passwords for you on your
688320	690960	devices, it's also quite convenient.
690960	695560	You can manage your passwords using Dashling for free at dashling.com slash wendover.
695560	699700	They also have a whole suite of online security tools included with their premium package
