00:05.000 --> 00:07.040
Here's an interesting question.

00:07.040 --> 00:12.120
Which city do you think is more dense—Paris, France or New York, United States?

00:12.120 --> 00:19.280
It probably seems obvious—New York, the land of skyscrapers, the Big Apple, right?

00:19.280 --> 00:20.640
Wrong.

00:20.640 --> 00:25.400
New York, in fact, has a population density of less than half that of Paris.

00:25.400 --> 00:31.680
Paris's is 56,000 people per square mile while New York's is only 27,000 people per

00:31.680 --> 00:33.000
square mile.

00:33.000 --> 00:37.780
To find a European city with a comparable population density to New York's—the densest

00:37.780 --> 00:43.600
American city—you have to go all the way down to number six on the list—Lyon, France.

00:43.600 --> 00:49.000
New York, of course, has a super dense urban core, but then around it is miles and miles

00:49.000 --> 00:52.560
of suburbia, just like almost every other American city.

00:52.560 --> 00:58.200
Paris, on the other hand, packs almost its entire population into a compact urban core.

00:58.200 --> 01:02.200
There's also another interesting pattern that differs between the two continents.

01:02.200 --> 01:04.600
Rich Americans live outside the city.

01:04.600 --> 01:07.440
Rich Europeans live city center.

01:07.440 --> 01:10.520
Compare the income map of Paris to that of Philadelphia.

01:10.520 --> 01:14.240
Of course it's not perfect, but you can definitely see a pattern.

01:14.240 --> 01:18.300
The most commonly cited reason for both these trends is the difference in age.

01:18.300 --> 01:23.300
Most European cities have existed for hundreds if not thousands of years while all but a

01:23.300 --> 01:27.980
few American cities have only gathered enough population to be called cities in the past

01:27.980 --> 01:30.220
one or two hundred years.

01:30.220 --> 01:34.500
What that means is that European cities existed when all but the super rich had to commute

01:34.500 --> 01:35.900
to work by foot.

01:35.900 --> 01:41.260
In the middle ages, Paris had a population of two to three hundred thousand people, but

01:41.260 --> 01:45.120
you could walk from one side to the other in 30 minutes.

01:45.120 --> 01:47.400
It was incredibly densely populated.

01:47.400 --> 01:50.440
You just had to live within walking distance of work.

01:50.440 --> 01:54.920
Therefore, the rich paid more for the houses closest to the center of the city.

01:54.920 --> 01:59.700
This is a similar reason to why in historic European hotels, you'll often see the nicest

01:59.700 --> 02:04.560
and largest rooms on the lower floors—the opposite of what you'd see today.

02:04.560 --> 02:08.400
Before elevators existed, the rich didn't want to have to walk up as many flights of

02:08.400 --> 02:09.740
stairs.

02:09.740 --> 02:12.700
Walking distance was not only important to big cities.

02:12.700 --> 02:17.980
Small villages across Europe were almost always the same size because their population

02:17.980 --> 02:21.820
was dictated by the walkability of the surrounding fields.

02:21.820 --> 02:26.660
European farmers tended to live in small towns and walk to their fields during the day rather

02:26.660 --> 02:29.340
than the homesteading approach used in America.

02:29.340 --> 02:33.140
Therefore, villages would only be as large as the amount of people needed to work in

02:33.140 --> 02:36.260
the fields within walking distance.

02:36.260 --> 02:40.700
American cities, on the other hand, began their period of rapid growth in a more modern

02:40.700 --> 02:45.620
era when decentralizing technologies were much more advanced.

02:45.620 --> 02:49.580
By the time North American cities grew larger than the distance people could reasonably

02:49.580 --> 02:53.980
walk, there was already the technological capability to create public transportation

02:53.980 --> 02:54.980
systems.

02:54.980 --> 03:00.340
The first major public transportation innovation was the steam train in the mid-19th century.

03:00.340 --> 03:04.700
This was a very expensive means of transport and was therefore only for the super-rich.

03:04.700 --> 03:10.820
Interestingly, because steam trains take an enormous amount of time to reach speed,

03:10.820 --> 03:15.220
the towns that the rich commuted from, known as railroad suburbs, were generally not just

03:15.220 --> 03:20.980
at the nearest bit of countryside, but separated from the city by a few miles of countryside.

03:20.980 --> 03:23.860
The impact of railroad suburbs remains today.

03:23.860 --> 03:28.060
On the tracks of the old Philadelphia mainline, there's a stretch of super-rich communities

03:28.060 --> 03:31.880
with huge estates and country clubs from Ardmore to Malvern.

03:31.880 --> 03:35.980
The demographics just never changed from the time of the railroad suburb.

03:35.980 --> 03:41.120
A few decades later, streetcars emerged and quickly became an instrumental part of the

03:41.120 --> 03:42.660
American commute.

03:42.660 --> 03:47.480
Much like steam trains, streetcars also created new communities, this time with slightly less

03:47.480 --> 03:50.020
rich, upper-middle class individuals.

03:50.020 --> 03:55.760
In Washington DC, the wealthy suburbs of Tenleytown, Chevy Chase, Bethesda, McLean, Rockville,

03:55.760 --> 03:59.200
and more all grew as a result of the streetcar.

03:59.200 --> 04:03.520
But once again, walking distance influenced geography.

04:03.520 --> 04:07.880
Streetcar commuters had to live within walking distance of a stop so naturally there would

04:07.880 --> 04:13.200
be a radius of civilization around 20 or 30 minutes walking distance from a stop.

04:13.200 --> 04:15.580
Then past that, nothing.

04:15.580 --> 04:19.840
That meant that between the lines, there was all this open space where nobody could commute

04:19.840 --> 04:20.840
from.

04:20.840 --> 04:22.700
Enter the automobile.

04:22.700 --> 04:27.000
At first the car was only for upper-class individuals, especially with the distraction

04:27.000 --> 04:29.280
of the two world wars and Great Depression.

04:29.280 --> 04:34.660
However, by the time young Americans returned from World War II, there had been enough technological

04:34.660 --> 04:38.340
advances to make the automobile affordable for the middle class.

04:38.340 --> 04:41.940
Over 50% of households had cars by 1950.

04:41.940 --> 04:46.280
At the same time, the government was offering loans to returning veterans which significantly

04:46.280 --> 04:50.360
increased the number of Americans who could afford to buy homes.

04:50.360 --> 04:55.080
Instead of buying a small central city home, this generation opted to use their new cars

04:55.080 --> 04:59.080
to commute from cheaper, nicer, and larger suburban homes.

04:59.080 --> 05:02.800
The idea was that the working parents would go downtown each day while the rest of the

05:02.800 --> 05:05.240
family would stay to enjoy the suburb.

05:05.240 --> 05:07.080
It was the perfect deal.

05:07.080 --> 05:12.120
So that whole history was absolutely true, but it doesn't entirely explain why European

05:12.120 --> 05:15.160
cities didn't experience suburbanization as well.

05:15.160 --> 05:20.320
In Germany, for example, many, if not most cities were bombed to rubble during World

05:20.320 --> 05:21.540
War II.

05:21.540 --> 05:26.420
They had the opportunity to rebuild in any way they wanted but then chose to keep their

05:26.420 --> 05:27.860
compact design.

05:27.860 --> 05:33.020
Today, the average metropolitan population density in Germany is four times higher than

05:33.020 --> 05:34.300
the US is.

05:34.300 --> 05:38.940
At the same time, other cities across Europe that survived the war experienced enormous

05:38.940 --> 05:44.360
population influxes and still maintain their mammoth population densities.

05:44.360 --> 05:48.700
Perhaps the least commonly cited reason for suburbanization in the US is crime.

05:48.860 --> 05:53.540
It's a bit of an ugly period in American history that we sometimes forget, but crime

05:53.540 --> 05:58.720
levels were absolutely insane in the 70s, 80s, and 90s.

05:58.720 --> 06:01.220
There are a ton of different theories why this is.

06:01.220 --> 06:05.460
Perhaps the most interesting being that the rise in gasoline emitted lead caused lower

06:05.460 --> 06:08.220
IQs and higher aggressivity.

06:08.220 --> 06:14.940
New York had an astronomical 2,245 murders in 1990.

06:15.140 --> 06:19.140
London didn't even have that many in the entire 90s decade.

06:19.140 --> 06:24.740
Violent crime rates are still consistently ten or more times higher in the US.

06:24.740 --> 06:30.540
In 1992, a poll was conducted asking departing New Yorkers why they were moving to the suburbs

06:30.540 --> 06:34.900
and the most commonly cited reason was crime at 47%.

06:34.900 --> 06:40.500
Cost and quality of living were way down at lower than 10% each.

06:40.500 --> 06:45.340
Crime rates are significantly lower in suburbs as they are typically havens for higher income

06:45.340 --> 06:46.340
individuals.

06:46.340 --> 06:50.620
Europeans don't have to worry as much about intercity crime so they are much more willing

06:50.620 --> 06:52.860
to live downtown.

06:52.860 --> 06:57.240
Land for suburban housing is also readily available in the US because farmers have always

06:57.240 --> 07:01.760
been quick to sell their relatively unprofitable land to developers.

07:01.760 --> 07:07.620
By contrast, in France, for example, agricultural subsidies are 12 times higher per acre of

07:07.620 --> 07:08.620
land than the US.

07:08.660 --> 07:14.820
That's a big reason why large European cities are still closely surrounded by small farms.

07:14.820 --> 07:19.620
In many European cities, you can literally take the city bus to farms.

07:19.620 --> 07:23.660
Lastly, all sorts of energy are cheaper in the US.

07:23.660 --> 07:29.580
A gallon of gas costs as much as $7 in some parts of Europe compared to the US average

07:29.580 --> 07:31.180
of $2.20.

07:31.180 --> 07:37.140
It's significantly more expensive to commute by car in Europe so there's more motivation

07:37.180 --> 07:42.260
to live closer to work where either the drive is shorter or you can take public transportation.

07:42.260 --> 07:47.540
Also, big suburban homes aren't as attractive in Europe because electricity and heating

07:47.540 --> 07:49.580
costs are higher.

07:49.580 --> 07:52.620
Suburban life really didn't live up to expectations.

07:52.620 --> 07:58.100
Americans now spend an average of 4 and a quarter hours per week sitting in cars, buses,

07:58.100 --> 08:00.700
or trains traveling to or from work.

08:00.700 --> 08:04.300
That's 2.5% of their entire lives.

08:04.300 --> 08:09.380
It's also been scientifically proven that commuting from the suburbs is linked to higher

08:09.380 --> 08:14.300
blood pressure, lower frustration tolerance, and higher rates of anxiety.

08:14.300 --> 08:18.740
Also, the suburbs are no longer the countryside havens that they once were.

08:18.740 --> 08:21.940
They're just a continuation of the urban sprawl.

08:21.940 --> 08:25.800
Rich Americans are therefore beginning to return to the city.

08:25.800 --> 08:30.880
With lower crime rates, higher fuel costs, and an overall shift in attitude, urban cores

08:30.880 --> 08:33.320
are having a second renaissance.

08:33.320 --> 08:38.080
So that's why we live where we do—it's a complicated, controversial, and surprisingly

08:38.080 --> 08:39.960
political history.

08:39.960 --> 08:42.600
