0	5000	This is Wendover Productions, sponsored by the Great Courses Plus.
5000	7040	Here's an interesting question.
7040	12120	Which city do you think is more dense—Paris, France or New York, United States?
12120	19280	It probably seems obvious—New York, the land of skyscrapers, the Big Apple, right?
19280	20640	Wrong.
20640	25400	New York, in fact, has a population density of less than half that of Paris.
25400	31680	Paris's is 56,000 people per square mile while New York's is only 27,000 people per
31680	33000	square mile.
33000	37780	To find a European city with a comparable population density to New York's—the densest
37780	43600	American city—you have to go all the way down to number six on the list—Lyon, France.
43600	49000	New York, of course, has a super dense urban core, but then around it is miles and miles
49000	52560	of suburbia, just like almost every other American city.
52560	58200	Paris, on the other hand, packs almost its entire population into a compact urban core.
58200	62200	There's also another interesting pattern that differs between the two continents.
62200	64600	Rich Americans live outside the city.
64600	67440	Rich Europeans live city center.
67440	70520	Compare the income map of Paris to that of Philadelphia.
70520	74240	Of course it's not perfect, but you can definitely see a pattern.
74240	78300	The most commonly cited reason for both these trends is the difference in age.
78300	83300	Most European cities have existed for hundreds if not thousands of years while all but a
83300	87980	few American cities have only gathered enough population to be called cities in the past
87980	90220	one or two hundred years.
90220	94500	What that means is that European cities existed when all but the super rich had to commute
94500	95900	to work by foot.
95900	101260	In the middle ages, Paris had a population of two to three hundred thousand people, but
101260	105120	you could walk from one side to the other in 30 minutes.
105120	107400	It was incredibly densely populated.
107400	110440	You just had to live within walking distance of work.
110440	114920	Therefore, the rich paid more for the houses closest to the center of the city.
114920	119700	This is a similar reason to why in historic European hotels, you'll often see the nicest
119700	124560	and largest rooms on the lower floors—the opposite of what you'd see today.
124560	128400	Before elevators existed, the rich didn't want to have to walk up as many flights of
128400	129740	stairs.
129740	132700	Walking distance was not only important to big cities.
132700	137980	Small villages across Europe were almost always the same size because their population
137980	141820	was dictated by the walkability of the surrounding fields.
141820	146660	European farmers tended to live in small towns and walk to their fields during the day rather
146660	149340	than the homesteading approach used in America.
149340	153140	Therefore, villages would only be as large as the amount of people needed to work in
153140	156260	the fields within walking distance.
156260	160700	American cities, on the other hand, began their period of rapid growth in a more modern
160700	165620	era when decentralizing technologies were much more advanced.
165620	169580	By the time North American cities grew larger than the distance people could reasonably
169580	173980	walk, there was already the technological capability to create public transportation
173980	174980	systems.
174980	180340	The first major public transportation innovation was the steam train in the mid-19th century.
180340	184700	This was a very expensive means of transport and was therefore only for the super-rich.
184700	190820	Interestingly, because steam trains take an enormous amount of time to reach speed,
190820	195220	the towns that the rich commuted from, known as railroad suburbs, were generally not just
195220	200980	at the nearest bit of countryside, but separated from the city by a few miles of countryside.
200980	203860	The impact of railroad suburbs remains today.
203860	208060	On the tracks of the old Philadelphia mainline, there's a stretch of super-rich communities
208060	211880	with huge estates and country clubs from Ardmore to Malvern.
211880	215980	The demographics just never changed from the time of the railroad suburb.
215980	221120	A few decades later, streetcars emerged and quickly became an instrumental part of the
221120	222660	American commute.
222660	227480	Much like steam trains, streetcars also created new communities, this time with slightly less
227480	230020	rich, upper-middle class individuals.
230020	235760	In Washington DC, the wealthy suburbs of Tenleytown, Chevy Chase, Bethesda, McLean, Rockville,
235760	239200	and more all grew as a result of the streetcar.
239200	243520	But once again, walking distance influenced geography.
243520	247880	Streetcar commuters had to live within walking distance of a stop so naturally there would
247880	253200	be a radius of civilization around 20 or 30 minutes walking distance from a stop.
253200	255580	Then past that, nothing.
255580	259840	That meant that between the lines, there was all this open space where nobody could commute
259840	260840	from.
260840	262700	Enter the automobile.
262700	267000	At first the car was only for upper-class individuals, especially with the distraction
267000	269280	of the two world wars and Great Depression.
269280	274660	However, by the time young Americans returned from World War II, there had been enough technological
274660	278340	advances to make the automobile affordable for the middle class.
278340	281940	Over 50% of households had cars by 1950.
281940	286280	At the same time, the government was offering loans to returning veterans which significantly
286280	290360	increased the number of Americans who could afford to buy homes.
290360	295080	Instead of buying a small central city home, this generation opted to use their new cars
295080	299080	to commute from cheaper, nicer, and larger suburban homes.
299080	302800	The idea was that the working parents would go downtown each day while the rest of the
302800	305240	family would stay to enjoy the suburb.
305240	307080	It was the perfect deal.
307080	312120	So that whole history was absolutely true, but it doesn't entirely explain why European
312120	315160	cities didn't experience suburbanization as well.
315160	320320	In Germany, for example, many, if not most cities were bombed to rubble during World
320320	321540	War II.
321540	326420	They had the opportunity to rebuild in any way they wanted but then chose to keep their
326420	327860	compact design.
327860	333020	Today, the average metropolitan population density in Germany is four times higher than
333020	334300	the US is.
334300	338940	At the same time, other cities across Europe that survived the war experienced enormous
338940	344360	population influxes and still maintain their mammoth population densities.
344360	348700	Perhaps the least commonly cited reason for suburbanization in the US is crime.
348860	353540	It's a bit of an ugly period in American history that we sometimes forget, but crime
353540	358720	levels were absolutely insane in the 70s, 80s, and 90s.
358720	361220	There are a ton of different theories why this is.
361220	365460	Perhaps the most interesting being that the rise in gasoline emitted lead caused lower
365460	368220	IQs and higher aggressivity.
368220	374940	New York had an astronomical 2,245 murders in 1990.
375140	379140	London didn't even have that many in the entire 90s decade.
379140	384740	Violent crime rates are still consistently ten or more times higher in the US.
384740	390540	In 1992, a poll was conducted asking departing New Yorkers why they were moving to the suburbs
390540	394900	and the most commonly cited reason was crime at 47%.
394900	400500	Cost and quality of living were way down at lower than 10% each.
400500	405340	Crime rates are significantly lower in suburbs as they are typically havens for higher income
405340	406340	individuals.
406340	410620	Europeans don't have to worry as much about intercity crime so they are much more willing
410620	412860	to live downtown.
412860	417240	Land for suburban housing is also readily available in the US because farmers have always
417240	421760	been quick to sell their relatively unprofitable land to developers.
421760	427620	By contrast, in France, for example, agricultural subsidies are 12 times higher per acre of
427620	428620	land than the US.
428660	434820	That's a big reason why large European cities are still closely surrounded by small farms.
434820	439620	In many European cities, you can literally take the city bus to farms.
439620	443660	Lastly, all sorts of energy are cheaper in the US.
443660	449580	A gallon of gas costs as much as $7 in some parts of Europe compared to the US average
449580	451180	of $2.20.
451180	457140	It's significantly more expensive to commute by car in Europe so there's more motivation
457180	462260	to live closer to work where either the drive is shorter or you can take public transportation.
462260	467540	Also, big suburban homes aren't as attractive in Europe because electricity and heating
467540	469580	costs are higher.
469580	472620	Suburban life really didn't live up to expectations.
472620	478100	Americans now spend an average of 4 and a quarter hours per week sitting in cars, buses,
478100	480700	or trains traveling to or from work.
480700	484300	That's 2.5% of their entire lives.
484300	489380	It's also been scientifically proven that commuting from the suburbs is linked to higher
489380	494300	blood pressure, lower frustration tolerance, and higher rates of anxiety.
494300	498740	Also, the suburbs are no longer the countryside havens that they once were.
498740	501940	They're just a continuation of the urban sprawl.
501940	505800	Rich Americans are therefore beginning to return to the city.
505800	510880	With lower crime rates, higher fuel costs, and an overall shift in attitude, urban cores
510880	513320	are having a second renaissance.
513320	518080	So that's why we live where we do—it's a complicated, controversial, and surprisingly
518080	519960	political history.
