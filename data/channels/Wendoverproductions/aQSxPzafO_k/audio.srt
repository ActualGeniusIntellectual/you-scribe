2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,040
Here's an interesting question.

3
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:12,120
Which city do you think is more dense—Paris, France or New York, United States?

4
00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:19,280
It probably seems obvious—New York, the land of skyscrapers, the Big Apple, right?

5
00:00:19,280 --> 00:00:20,640
Wrong.

6
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:25,400
New York, in fact, has a population density of less than half that of Paris.

7
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:31,680
Paris's is 56,000 people per square mile while New York's is only 27,000 people per

8
00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:33,000
square mile.

9
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,780
To find a European city with a comparable population density to New York's—the densest

10
00:00:37,780 --> 00:00:43,600
American city—you have to go all the way down to number six on the list—Lyon, France.

11
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:49,000
New York, of course, has a super dense urban core, but then around it is miles and miles

12
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,560
of suburbia, just like almost every other American city.

13
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:58,200
Paris, on the other hand, packs almost its entire population into a compact urban core.

14
00:00:58,200 --> 00:01:02,200
There's also another interesting pattern that differs between the two continents.

15
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:04,600
Rich Americans live outside the city.

16
00:01:04,600 --> 00:01:07,440
Rich Europeans live city center.

17
00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:10,520
Compare the income map of Paris to that of Philadelphia.

18
00:01:10,520 --> 00:01:14,240
Of course it's not perfect, but you can definitely see a pattern.

19
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:18,300
The most commonly cited reason for both these trends is the difference in age.

20
00:01:18,300 --> 00:01:23,300
Most European cities have existed for hundreds if not thousands of years while all but a

21
00:01:23,300 --> 00:01:27,980
few American cities have only gathered enough population to be called cities in the past

22
00:01:27,980 --> 00:01:30,220
one or two hundred years.

23
00:01:30,220 --> 00:01:34,500
What that means is that European cities existed when all but the super rich had to commute

24
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:35,900
to work by foot.

25
00:01:35,900 --> 00:01:41,260
In the middle ages, Paris had a population of two to three hundred thousand people, but

26
00:01:41,260 --> 00:01:45,120
you could walk from one side to the other in 30 minutes.

27
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:47,400
It was incredibly densely populated.

28
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:50,440
You just had to live within walking distance of work.

29
00:01:50,440 --> 00:01:54,920
Therefore, the rich paid more for the houses closest to the center of the city.

30
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:59,700
This is a similar reason to why in historic European hotels, you'll often see the nicest

31
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:04,560
and largest rooms on the lower floors—the opposite of what you'd see today.

32
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:08,400
Before elevators existed, the rich didn't want to have to walk up as many flights of

33
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:09,740
stairs.

34
00:02:09,740 --> 00:02:12,700
Walking distance was not only important to big cities.

35
00:02:12,700 --> 00:02:17,980
Small villages across Europe were almost always the same size because their population

36
00:02:17,980 --> 00:02:21,820
was dictated by the walkability of the surrounding fields.

37
00:02:21,820 --> 00:02:26,660
European farmers tended to live in small towns and walk to their fields during the day rather

38
00:02:26,660 --> 00:02:29,340
than the homesteading approach used in America.

39
00:02:29,340 --> 00:02:33,140
Therefore, villages would only be as large as the amount of people needed to work in

40
00:02:33,140 --> 00:02:36,260
the fields within walking distance.

41
00:02:36,260 --> 00:02:40,700
American cities, on the other hand, began their period of rapid growth in a more modern

42
00:02:40,700 --> 00:02:45,620
era when decentralizing technologies were much more advanced.

43
00:02:45,620 --> 00:02:49,580
By the time North American cities grew larger than the distance people could reasonably

44
00:02:49,580 --> 00:02:53,980
walk, there was already the technological capability to create public transportation

45
00:02:53,980 --> 00:02:54,980
systems.

46
00:02:54,980 --> 00:03:00,340
The first major public transportation innovation was the steam train in the mid-19th century.

47
00:03:00,340 --> 00:03:04,700
This was a very expensive means of transport and was therefore only for the super-rich.

48
00:03:04,700 --> 00:03:10,820
Interestingly, because steam trains take an enormous amount of time to reach speed,

49
00:03:10,820 --> 00:03:15,220
the towns that the rich commuted from, known as railroad suburbs, were generally not just

50
00:03:15,220 --> 00:03:20,980
at the nearest bit of countryside, but separated from the city by a few miles of countryside.

51
00:03:20,980 --> 00:03:23,860
The impact of railroad suburbs remains today.

52
00:03:23,860 --> 00:03:28,060
On the tracks of the old Philadelphia mainline, there's a stretch of super-rich communities

53
00:03:28,060 --> 00:03:31,880
with huge estates and country clubs from Ardmore to Malvern.

54
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:35,980
The demographics just never changed from the time of the railroad suburb.

55
00:03:35,980 --> 00:03:41,120
A few decades later, streetcars emerged and quickly became an instrumental part of the

56
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:42,660
American commute.

57
00:03:42,660 --> 00:03:47,480
Much like steam trains, streetcars also created new communities, this time with slightly less

58
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:50,020
rich, upper-middle class individuals.

59
00:03:50,020 --> 00:03:55,760
In Washington DC, the wealthy suburbs of Tenleytown, Chevy Chase, Bethesda, McLean, Rockville,

60
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:59,200
and more all grew as a result of the streetcar.

61
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:03,520
But once again, walking distance influenced geography.

62
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:07,880
Streetcar commuters had to live within walking distance of a stop so naturally there would

63
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:13,200
be a radius of civilization around 20 or 30 minutes walking distance from a stop.

64
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:15,580
Then past that, nothing.

65
00:04:15,580 --> 00:04:19,840
That meant that between the lines, there was all this open space where nobody could commute

66
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:20,840
from.

67
00:04:20,840 --> 00:04:22,700
Enter the automobile.

68
00:04:22,700 --> 00:04:27,000
At first the car was only for upper-class individuals, especially with the distraction

69
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,280
of the two world wars and Great Depression.

70
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:34,660
However, by the time young Americans returned from World War II, there had been enough technological

71
00:04:34,660 --> 00:04:38,340
advances to make the automobile affordable for the middle class.

72
00:04:38,340 --> 00:04:41,940
Over 50% of households had cars by 1950.

73
00:04:41,940 --> 00:04:46,280
At the same time, the government was offering loans to returning veterans which significantly

74
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:50,360
increased the number of Americans who could afford to buy homes.

75
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:55,080
Instead of buying a small central city home, this generation opted to use their new cars

76
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:59,080
to commute from cheaper, nicer, and larger suburban homes.

77
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:02,800
The idea was that the working parents would go downtown each day while the rest of the

78
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:05,240
family would stay to enjoy the suburb.

79
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:07,080
It was the perfect deal.

80
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:12,120
So that whole history was absolutely true, but it doesn't entirely explain why European

81
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:15,160
cities didn't experience suburbanization as well.

82
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:20,320
In Germany, for example, many, if not most cities were bombed to rubble during World

83
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:21,540
War II.

84
00:05:21,540 --> 00:05:26,420
They had the opportunity to rebuild in any way they wanted but then chose to keep their

85
00:05:26,420 --> 00:05:27,860
compact design.

86
00:05:27,860 --> 00:05:33,020
Today, the average metropolitan population density in Germany is four times higher than

87
00:05:33,020 --> 00:05:34,300
the US is.

88
00:05:34,300 --> 00:05:38,940
At the same time, other cities across Europe that survived the war experienced enormous

89
00:05:38,940 --> 00:05:44,360
population influxes and still maintain their mammoth population densities.

90
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:48,700
Perhaps the least commonly cited reason for suburbanization in the US is crime.

91
00:05:48,860 --> 00:05:53,540
It's a bit of an ugly period in American history that we sometimes forget, but crime

92
00:05:53,540 --> 00:05:58,720
levels were absolutely insane in the 70s, 80s, and 90s.

93
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:01,220
There are a ton of different theories why this is.

94
00:06:01,220 --> 00:06:05,460
Perhaps the most interesting being that the rise in gasoline emitted lead caused lower

95
00:06:05,460 --> 00:06:08,220
IQs and higher aggressivity.

96
00:06:08,220 --> 00:06:14,940
New York had an astronomical 2,245 murders in 1990.

97
00:06:15,140 --> 00:06:19,140
London didn't even have that many in the entire 90s decade.

98
00:06:19,140 --> 00:06:24,740
Violent crime rates are still consistently ten or more times higher in the US.

99
00:06:24,740 --> 00:06:30,540
In 1992, a poll was conducted asking departing New Yorkers why they were moving to the suburbs

100
00:06:30,540 --> 00:06:34,900
and the most commonly cited reason was crime at 47%.

101
00:06:34,900 --> 00:06:40,500
Cost and quality of living were way down at lower than 10% each.

102
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:45,340
Crime rates are significantly lower in suburbs as they are typically havens for higher income

103
00:06:45,340 --> 00:06:46,340
individuals.

104
00:06:46,340 --> 00:06:50,620
Europeans don't have to worry as much about intercity crime so they are much more willing

105
00:06:50,620 --> 00:06:52,860
to live downtown.

106
00:06:52,860 --> 00:06:57,240
Land for suburban housing is also readily available in the US because farmers have always

107
00:06:57,240 --> 00:07:01,760
been quick to sell their relatively unprofitable land to developers.

108
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:07,620
By contrast, in France, for example, agricultural subsidies are 12 times higher per acre of

109
00:07:07,620 --> 00:07:08,620
land than the US.

110
00:07:08,660 --> 00:07:14,820
That's a big reason why large European cities are still closely surrounded by small farms.

111
00:07:14,820 --> 00:07:19,620
In many European cities, you can literally take the city bus to farms.

112
00:07:19,620 --> 00:07:23,660
Lastly, all sorts of energy are cheaper in the US.

113
00:07:23,660 --> 00:07:29,580
A gallon of gas costs as much as $7 in some parts of Europe compared to the US average

114
00:07:29,580 --> 00:07:31,180
of $2.20.

115
00:07:31,180 --> 00:07:37,140
It's significantly more expensive to commute by car in Europe so there's more motivation

116
00:07:37,180 --> 00:07:42,260
to live closer to work where either the drive is shorter or you can take public transportation.

117
00:07:42,260 --> 00:07:47,540
Also, big suburban homes aren't as attractive in Europe because electricity and heating

118
00:07:47,540 --> 00:07:49,580
costs are higher.

119
00:07:49,580 --> 00:07:52,620
Suburban life really didn't live up to expectations.

120
00:07:52,620 --> 00:07:58,100
Americans now spend an average of 4 and a quarter hours per week sitting in cars, buses,

121
00:07:58,100 --> 00:08:00,700
or trains traveling to or from work.

122
00:08:00,700 --> 00:08:04,300
That's 2.5% of their entire lives.

123
00:08:04,300 --> 00:08:09,380
It's also been scientifically proven that commuting from the suburbs is linked to higher

124
00:08:09,380 --> 00:08:14,300
blood pressure, lower frustration tolerance, and higher rates of anxiety.

125
00:08:14,300 --> 00:08:18,740
Also, the suburbs are no longer the countryside havens that they once were.

126
00:08:18,740 --> 00:08:21,940
They're just a continuation of the urban sprawl.

127
00:08:21,940 --> 00:08:25,800
Rich Americans are therefore beginning to return to the city.

128
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:30,880
With lower crime rates, higher fuel costs, and an overall shift in attitude, urban cores

129
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:33,320
are having a second renaissance.

130
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:38,080
So that's why we live where we do—it's a complicated, controversial, and surprisingly

131
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:39,960
political history.
