00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,840
This is a Wendover Productions video made possible by Backblaze and in collaboration

2
00:00:05,840 --> 00:00:09,000
with Alternate History Hub and Real Life Lore.

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:10,400
Russia is immense.

4
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:16,960
It spans 5,000 miles across, 2,000 miles vertically, crosses 11 time zones, borders everywhere

5
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:21,080
from Norway to North Korea, and is as close to Anchorage as it is to Amsterdam.

6
00:00:21,080 --> 00:00:26,880
It's huge, but it has a problem—a problem that can explain part of why the average Russian,

7
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:33,760
living at the same latitude as Finland, Sweden, Norway, Iceland, and Canada, makes only $7,500

8
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:38,120
American dollars per year—a problem that can explain at least a portion of almost every

9
00:00:38,120 --> 00:00:41,000
political decision the country has ever made.

10
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,320
Russia's geography is flawed.

11
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:47,920
What you have to remember about Russia is that the majority of Russians live in Europe.

12
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:51,800
Three quarters of Russia's population lives in the western quarter of the country.

13
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:56,360
Therefore, as a country with a fairly centralized power system, many of its decisions go to

14
00:00:56,360 --> 00:00:59,080
protect the country core in and around Moscow.

15
00:00:59,080 --> 00:01:04,660
You see, a lot of the success of certain countries over others depends on how well its geography

16
00:01:04,660 --> 00:01:05,720
protects it.

17
00:01:05,720 --> 00:01:11,320
The US, for example, benefited hugely from being an ocean away from every large military

18
00:01:11,320 --> 00:01:12,320
power.

19
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:16,480
The only real armed forces that could threaten the US in its infancy were in Europe or Asia

20
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:22,060
and therefore any invasion would require trans-oceanic supply lines which are hugely expensive and

21
00:01:22,060 --> 00:01:26,040
logistically difficult therefore weakening an invading army.

22
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:29,320
On the European continent, France has a similar situation.

23
00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:32,780
Their northwestern border is protected by the English Channel, their western border

24
00:01:32,780 --> 00:01:36,680
by the Atlantic Ocean, their southern border by the Pyrenees Mountains and the Mediterranean

25
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:41,440
Ocean, their southeastern by the Alps Mountains, and their northeastern by the Rhine River.

26
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:46,840
The eastern half of their northern border is, however, largely unprotected geographically—a

27
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:51,760
flawed Germany exploited in both World War I and World War II by invading through Belgium

28
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:52,760
and Luxembourg.

29
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:57,800
But the protection still did concentrate attacks into a choke point and kept it significantly

30
00:01:57,800 --> 00:02:00,760
more protected than other European countries.

31
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:05,440
Here's Cody from Alternate History Hub to explain Russia's territorial expansion.

32
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:10,800
Russia's first territorial expansion was entirely a quest for power, starting when

33
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:17,160
it unified into a single East Slavic state in 882, but over time this expanse for glory

34
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:21,120
transformed into an effort to protect the core of the country.

35
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:24,640
This early Russia was very unprotected and vulnerable.

36
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:29,720
There was no geographic protection to keep foreigners from migrating into Russian lands.

37
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:34,760
The only natural resource the fledgling nation had at their disposal was pure manpower.

38
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:40,480
In the coming centuries, what was then known as the Grand Duchy of Moscow quickly expanded.

39
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:44,960
By the time Ivan the Terrible was crowned ruler of the Tsardom of Russia, the country

40
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:50,920
had spread its borders east to the Urals, south to the Caucasus, and west to the Carpathian

41
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:51,920
Mountains.

42
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:57,700
Eventually even Siberia was conquered which, before then, was an independent Khanate—a

43
00:02:57,700 --> 00:02:59,380
territory ruled by a Khan.

44
00:02:59,380 --> 00:03:01,320
That was Cody from Alternate History Hub.

45
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:05,040
I collaborated with him to make a great video on his channel about what the world would

46
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:08,880
be like if Russia had never become its own country which I'll link in the description

47
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:10,760
and at the end of the video.

48
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:16,440
Now with all this territory, Russia, or at least Moscow, had some serious protection.

49
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:21,100
Siberia is large enough that no army could invade through it and make it to Moscow.

50
00:03:21,100 --> 00:03:26,280
The supply lines would have to be thousands of miles long through inhospitable conditions.

51
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:30,700
Not only that, but the army with a one or two thousand mile long supply line would then

52
00:03:30,700 --> 00:03:34,240
have to make it over the Ural Mountains to get to Moscow.

53
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:38,840
Attacking from the south or west would also take an army either across water or through

54
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:39,840
mountains.

55
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:45,360
By the time the 19th century rolled in, Russia had truly become an unconquerable power.

56
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:49,960
Countries could and can take over portions of Russia, but there is no conceivable way

57
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:53,920
that a single country could fully occupy and conquer Russia.

58
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:59,800
To occupy a territory of that size, a country would need an estimated 13 million trained

59
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:04,200
ground troops—more than the 17 largest militaries combined.

60
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:09,560
However, despite its defenses, Russia has never developed economically to the same level

61
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:11,360
as some of its neighbors.

62
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:17,360
Its GDP per capita is right around that of Mauritius, Grenada, and Turkey and this, once

63
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:21,480
again, can be at least partially attributed to geography.

64
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:24,520
Historically, naval power equaled power.

65
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:26,100
The two were synonymous.

66
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:30,380
There was no better way for countries to project their power and grow their economy than to

67
00:04:30,380 --> 00:04:33,200
have a powerful navy and merchant fleet.

68
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:38,640
Many of the most powerful countries today—the United Kingdom, Japan, and China, for example—were

69
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:41,480
ones that once had the most powerful navies in the world.

70
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:46,940
There's a reason that none of the 18 largest economies in the world are landlocked countries.

71
00:04:46,940 --> 00:04:51,880
Up until the last century, maritime shipping was the fastest way to get goods and people

72
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:56,600
across the world and it's still the cheapest way to ship goods long distance.

73
00:04:56,600 --> 00:05:01,680
Having good water access allows countries to trade with the world, but Russia, despite

74
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:08,400
its 23,000 miles of coastline, has no significant warm water ice-free ports with direct access

75
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:09,520
to an ocean.

76
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:16,620
Alaska does, Canada does, Iceland does, Norway does, and Sweden too, but Russia is fundamentally

77
00:05:16,620 --> 00:05:21,740
limited in its maritime power because it has no easy way to access the world's oceans

78
00:05:21,740 --> 00:05:22,840
year-round.

79
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:27,360
The port of Novorossiysk is ice-free, but its throughput is limited by the depth and

80
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:28,600
size of the port.

81
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:33,240
St. Petersburg also has an important port, but it freezes for many months of the year.

82
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:37,980
On the Pacific side, ports like Vladivlastok also occasionally freeze during the winter,

83
00:05:38,020 --> 00:05:40,780
but the ice is not the biggest problem with these ports.

84
00:05:40,780 --> 00:05:44,540
The biggest problem is that their access to the world's oceans is all through choke

85
00:05:44,540 --> 00:05:48,220
points controlled by either NATO countries or NATO allies.

86
00:05:48,220 --> 00:05:52,060
To get to the ocean from Novorossiysk, you need to pass through the Bosphorus strait

87
00:05:52,060 --> 00:05:54,700
which is controlled by Turkey—a NATO country.

88
00:05:54,700 --> 00:05:58,260
To get to the ocean from St. Petersburg, you need to pass through the Danish straits controlled

89
00:05:58,260 --> 00:06:00,420
by Denmark—also a NATO country.

90
00:06:00,420 --> 00:06:04,240
And to get to the ocean from Vladivostok and many of the other Pacific ports, you need

91
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:09,120
to pass through the Sea of Japan which is controlled by Japan—a close ally of NATO.

92
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:14,060
If Russia ever decided to attack a NATO country or ally, their access to the world's oceans

93
00:06:14,060 --> 00:06:18,400
would be restricted by these NATO countries because the NATO treaty includes a mutual

94
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:22,580
defense pact—if one country is attacked, all respond.

95
00:06:22,580 --> 00:06:26,520
This would cripple both Russia's navy and economy.

96
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:28,000
Now back to defenses.

97
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:34,020
There's one major flaw to Russia's geographical defense system—the Northern European plane.

98
00:06:34,020 --> 00:06:38,920
Whereas every other border has a geographical defense preventing easy invasion from a foreign

99
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:44,060
army, this completely flat plane just acts as a funnel easily bringing an army from western

100
00:06:44,060 --> 00:06:45,700
Europe right up to Moscow.

101
00:06:45,700 --> 00:06:50,060
While a large part of the Soviet Union's motive to expand into eastern Europe was to

102
00:06:50,060 --> 00:06:54,860
spread the socialist revolution, Stalin still believed that he needed to create a zone of

103
00:06:54,860 --> 00:06:59,740
buffer states in order to defend against the threat of the USA and its allies in western

104
00:06:59,740 --> 00:07:00,740
Europe.

105
00:07:00,740 --> 00:07:05,920
With its influence over all of eastern Europe, the USSR had both manpower and political power

106
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:08,980
to keep the west far from Moscow.

107
00:07:08,980 --> 00:07:13,380
Since the fall of the Soviet Union, Russia has continued to strive to keep political

108
00:07:13,380 --> 00:07:14,900
power in the region.

109
00:07:14,900 --> 00:07:18,940
Out of the 15 states that emerged, 12 joined the Commonwealth of Independent States with

110
00:07:18,940 --> 00:07:23,860
Russia essentially aligning them politically with Russia while 3 joined both NATO and the

111
00:07:23,860 --> 00:07:28,040
European Union—Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia.

112
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:33,640
That means that, on paper, Russia still has a strong political buffer between it and western

113
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:34,640
Europe.

114
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:39,360
The Russian exclave of Kaliningrad and the countries of Belarus and Ukraine covered almost

115
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:41,680
all of the Northern European plane.

116
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:46,400
Not only that, but Russia used its influence in Ukraine to sign a long-term lease on the

117
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:51,840
warm water port of Sevastopol which greatly expanded the naval capabilities of Russia's

118
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:53,160
Black Sea fleet.

119
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:58,120
Except, Ukraine as a whole progressed to be more and more pro-European in the decades

120
00:07:58,120 --> 00:08:03,200
following the fall of the Soviet Union which was a major reason for Russia's invasion

121
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:04,200
of Crimea.

122
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:08,260
While on the surface Putin might have claimed Russia's invasion was to save the Russians

123
00:08:08,260 --> 00:08:13,680
of the area from the increasingly westernizing country, the annexation of Crimea was in reality

124
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:17,720
a strategic imperative to keep the warm water port of Sevastopol.

125
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:21,840
A Ukraine that was friendlier to the west likely would have ended Russia's lease on

126
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:26,980
the port so in Putin's mind he needed to invade Crimea in order to prevent a crippling

127
00:08:26,980 --> 00:08:29,520
blow to Russia's ocean access.

128
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:34,800
Now, Russia has managed to overcome many of its geographic challenges partially because

129
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:38,000
of two things—oil and natural gas.

130
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:42,640
It has enormous energy reserves partially because of its enormous size.

131
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:48,080
Russian natural gas pipelines provide for 40% of Europe's natural gas demand.

132
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:53,420
Some countries, such as Bulgaria, Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia, and Finland, are almost fully

133
00:08:53,420 --> 00:08:56,280
dependent on Russia for their natural gas.

134
00:08:56,280 --> 00:09:01,040
This gas dependency is a major reason why Germany, for example, a country with high

135
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:05,500
Russian oil dependency, is much less likely to criticize Russia than a country like the

136
00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:09,140
UK which has virtually zero Russian gas dependency.

137
00:09:09,140 --> 00:09:13,800
If Russia shut off the gas to Germany, it would devastate them, but stopping gas exports

138
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:16,280
to the UK would have little effect.

139
00:09:16,280 --> 00:09:21,320
The US has attempted to reduce Russian influence in Europe by exporting liquefied natural gas

140
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:22,640
across the Atlantic.

141
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:27,760
It costs more, but it allows western European countries to buy their energy from their American

142
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:28,760
ally.

143
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:32,280
Now, none of this discussion of ports and power is to say that if there was no Norway

144
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:36,000
or Sweden blocking the way to the ocean and the water was a bit warmer, Russia would be

145
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,520
the Sweden of the east.

146
00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:38,880
Saying that would be foolish.

147
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:43,600
Geography does have an enormous influence on human development, but it doesn't determine

148
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:44,600
it.

149
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:50,800
Geography is defined by chance, not circumstance, because, in the end, reality is just the confluence

150
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:53,460
of chance and circumstance.

151
00:09:53,460 --> 00:09:55,960
This video was made possible by Backblaze.

152
00:09:55,960 --> 00:09:59,380
So I was going to do this big, complicated pitch where I figured out the value of computer

153
00:09:59,380 --> 00:10:03,680
data in order to calculate the return on investment for signing up to Backblaze, but then it was

154
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:07,440
pointed out to me that you already know that you should back up your data.

155
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:11,440
It's like brushing your teeth, doing the dishes, taking out the trash, it's something

156
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:16,260
that you know you should do but don't want to because it's easy to ignore it.

157
00:10:16,260 --> 00:10:21,100
The only thing is backing up your data doesn't have to be difficult or expensive.

158
00:10:21,100 --> 00:10:25,880
With Backblaze, you just download their application to your computer, pay $5 per month, and it

159
00:10:25,880 --> 00:10:29,000
works in the background continuously backing up your data.

160
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,040
You can just completely forget about it.

161
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:36,120
If you ever do lose your data, all you have to do is sign into your account at backblaze.com

162
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:37,520
and download your data.

00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:41,200
If your internet isn't fast enough, they even have an option to ship you a physical

164
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:42,600
drive with your data instead.

165
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:48,480
What's best is that you can try this out for free for 15 days by using the link backblaze.com

166

slash wendover.

167
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:54,640
If you lose your data during those 15 days you'll still get it back at no cost.

168
00:10:54,640 --> 00:11:00,200
After that, it's only $5 per month for the peace of mind of knowing that, no matter what,

169
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:01,880
your data is safe.

174
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:20,480
I want to remind you to check out the video that Alternate History Hub made about what

175
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:22,640
the world would be like if Russia didn't exist.

176
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:26,760
It's a great video and then he collaborated with Real Life Lore to make another great

177
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:30,880
video about what would happen if the Soviet Union reunited.

178
